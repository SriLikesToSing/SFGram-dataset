SPECIAL WONDER 

The Anthony Boucher Me- 
morial Anthology of Fantasy 
and Science Fiction 

As editor, writer, critic and 
friend, Anthony Boucher af- 
fected the lives of a consid- 
erable number of people. 

When he died in 1968, some 
of them decided to create a 
unique memorial— twin an- 
thologies of the kinds of 
stories he had been most closely identified with. 
Beagle Books is proud to publish the paperback 
reprints of-these antholoqies, beginning with 
SPECIAL WONDER. 

Vol. 1: Stories by Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, R. 
Bretnor, Grendel Briarton, Fredric Brown, John Brunner, Doris Pitkin 
Buck, Mildred Clingerman, Avram Davidson, Jon De Cles, Miriam 
Allen DeFord, Richard Deming, Gordon R. Dickson, Harlan Ellison, 
Philip Jos6 Farmer. 

Vol. 2: Stories by Horace B. Fyfe, Randall Garrett, Damon Knight, Kris 
Neville, William F. Nolan, Alan E. Nourse, Chad Oliver, Mack Reynolds, 
Margaret St. Clair, Howard Schoenfeld, Robert Silverberg, Jack 
Vance, Richard Wilson. 

We will also publish shortly the companion anthology, CRIMES AND 
MISFORTUNES, containing stories by Queen, Stout, Carr, and 
twenty-six other top mystery writers. Like SPECIAL WONDER, it will 
appear in two volumes. 

950 each wherever paperback books are sold. 

The Beagle science fiction and fantasy list also includes: 

The Arkham Edition of H. P. Lovecraft 

THE TOMB AND OTHER TALES, AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MAD- 
NESS, THE LURKING FEAR, THE LURKER AT THE THRESHOLD

Dear Editor: 

I have been meaning to protest for 
some time, and finally got around to it. 
In the Hue and Cry column in IF, why 
don’t you publish complete addresses ? 
It would hardly take up enough time or 
paper to be a bother, and the lack oj 
address is occasionally infuriating. For 
a blatant example, in the May-June 
issue you published a letter from one 
Brian Hval, who wanted information 
on organizing a local science fiction 
club. Since you provided no address to 
which information could be sent, why 
did you bother publishing his letter at 
all? It was certainly no help to Mr. 
Hval; okay, you published one reply, 
which was too general to be much help. 
With a published address, he might 
well have bombarded with informa- 
tion — I’m certainly not going to send 
items specifically directed to one 
person to your magazine in the hopes 
that you’ll publish them, and other 
fans feel the same way. They write di- 
rectly or they don’t write. If Ted 
White can publish complete ad- 
dresses, why can’t you? 

Not everyone wants his address pub- 
lished — many people object to being 
targeted for mail-order solicitations, 
doorbell ringers or someone who just 
wants to argue. Mailing lists have be- 
come a marketable commodity and 
1 don’t want Hue and Cry so used. 



This policy will continue in effect, 
but you do raise a point. Let’s try it this 
way — contributors who want their 
addresses published may request that 
we do so and we’ll try to oblige. 

Starting with you. Your comments 
continue: 

. What’s all the alleged editorial 
confusion about Monarch being an 
“ enigmatic ” ending to the Dr. Dilling- 
ham series? The story fits, chronolog- 
ically, parallel to Equals Four, which 
you ran in your July- A ugust issue, with 
the ending of Monarch coming 
somewhere in the middle of Equals 
Four — some time between the time the 
Jann leaves the observation booth 
and the time it returns to it. What’s so 
enigmatic about that? Don’t you read 
the stories you publish? 

Sincerely, 

' Robert Coulson 
Route 3 
Hartford City, Ind. 

Gentlemen: 

Monarch was a good story. I didn’t 
read the first story or two of the se- 
quence. The stories have seemed light- 
hearted, but there just is no way to be 
lighthearted about a slave-labor camp! 
To say the least, that was grim. 

Now, about the ending — it’s not 
enigmatic at all. The next-to-last story 
of this series, so far, was Equals Four, 
roughly simultaneous with this 
story (excluding trips to the past, of 
course), ends with Dr. Dillingham’s 
robot presenting him with Judy. The 
robot rescued her — so the story ties 
in. 

Sincerely, 
Michael N. Tierstein

Do you have 
the “faults” 
that could mean 
you were born

Writers usually hate to be “labeled,” but 
there’s no denying most of them share 
certain characteristics. They’re dreamers. 
Loners. Bookworms. Too impractical, in- 
tense, idealistic. If you have “faults” like 
these, remember they may be the most cre- 
ative parts of your personality. They could 
be a clear indication of a gift. 

If you have such a gift, make the most 
of it. Hours you may be spending in time- 
killing diversions could be spent in produc- 
tive recreation. In the writer’s world, you 
can let your imagination roam free, doing 
what comes naturally to you. 

A unique writing school 

But where do you begin? It’s really very 
simple — we teach; you learn. Here at Famous 
Writers School, we’ve created a truly un- 
usual writing program that comes to you— 
right in your home. The program shortens 
the years of trial-and-error; helps you avoid 
the failures of so many beginning writers. 
It’s more like a shared adventure than a 
course.

I 

M IKE TARGETT stared 
morosely through the for- 
ward transparency of Module Five. 
The vehicle was traveling at a 
height of a few feet— and at its 
maximum survey speed of five 
hundred knots — across a flat 
brown desert. Apart from the 
plume of dust which roiled con- 
stantly in the rear screen there was 
no sign of movement anywhere on 
the broad face of Horta VII. And 
no sign of life. 

“Eight dead worlds in succes- 
sion,” he grumbled. “Why do we 
never find life?” 

“Because we work for the Car- 
tographical Service,” Dave Sur- 
genor told him, shifting to a more 
comfortable position in the mod- 
ule’s other seat. “If this were an in- 
habited world we wouldn’t be al- 
lowed to buzz all over it like this.” 
“I know, but I’d like to feel there 
was some chance of making con- 
tact with somebody. Anybody.” 

“I would suggest,” Surgenor 
said peacefully, “that you join the 
diplomatic service.” He closed his 
eyes with every appearance of a 
man about to drift into a con- 
tented after-dinner sleep. 

“I’m indebted to you.” 

Targett glanced resentfully at 
the older man’s relaxed profile. He 
had a deep respect for Surgenor 
and his vast experience in the Ser- 
vice, but at the same time he had 
no desire to emulate Surgenor’s 



career. It took a special kind of 
mind to withstand an endless suc- 
cession of treks across bleak, ali- 
en globes, and Targett was aware 
that he did not have it. The thought 
of growing old in the Service 
filled him with a dismay that 
strengthened his resolve to make 
some money quickly and get out 
while he was young enough to en- 
joy spending it. He had even de- 
cided on where he would have his 
fling. Next furlough he was going 
to visit Earth and try his luck on 
some of the legendary race 
courses there, the ones where it had 
all started. A gambler had no 
trouble finding facilities on any 
of the Federation’s inhabited 
worlds — but actually to stand on 
the historic turf on Santa Anita 
or Ascot . 

“Dave,” he said wistfully, 
“weren’t you in the Service in the 
old days when they used to allow 
the modules to break the search 
pattern and race back to the ship 
for the last five hundred miles?” 

Surgenor’s eyelids flickered. 
“The old days? That was only a 
year or so ago.” 

“That’s the old days in this line 
of business.” 

Targett glanced at the instru- 
ments on the control panel, which 
told him there were less than three 
thousand miles between Module 
Five’s present position and the 
planet’s north pole, where the 
Sarafand was waiting. The moth- 
er ship had disgorged its six sur- 



6 



IF 




vey modules at the south pole and 
— solely under the control of the 
AESOP computer — had done a 
half circuit of Horta VII, leaving 
the six modules to traverse the 
planet with their geodesic sensors. 

“We used to race back to the 
ship, but it led to trouble once and 
they introduced a regulation 
specifically forbidding it.” Sur- 
genor sounded more interested in 
getting to sleep. 

“Did you make any money out 
of it?” Targett persisted. “By lay- 
ing odds on the winner?” 

“It wouldn’t have worked.” Sur- 
genor yawned theatrically, mak- 
ing his point about not wanting to 
talk. “Every module had exactly 
the same chance — one in six.” 

“Not exactly the same chance,” 
Targett said, warming to his sub- 
ject. “I happen to know that Aesop 
tolerates a dispersion of up to 
twenty miles when he’s setting the 
Sarafand down at a pole — and if it 
worked out right at both ends one 
module could have a forty-mile 
advantage over its opposite 
number. All you would have to do 
to set up a profitable book would 
be—” 

“Mike,” Surgenor interrupted 
tiredly, “did you ever stop to con- 
sider that if you poured all that in- 
genuity into a legitimate busi- 
ness enterprise you’d be so rich 
you wouldn’t need to gamble?” 

Targett was appalled. “What 
has getting rich got to do with 
gambling?” 



“Is that not the whole idea?” 

“Go back to sleep, Dave — I’m 
sorry I disturbed you.” Targett 
rolled his eyes skyward and settled 
down to scowling through the for- 
ward transparency again. A 
range of low hills had appeared a 
few miles to the right, but other- 
wise the brown deserts of Horta 
VII were featureless as ever. He 
had been slumped in his seat for 
perhaps ten minutes when the 
module’s computer — which was 
actually a sub-unit of Aesop — 
made an annoucement. 

“Receiving atypical data,” it 
droned. “Receiving atypical data.” 

OMPUTER FIVE, give 
V-/ details,” Targett said, 
nudging Surgenor. 

“Bearing two point sixty-three, 
cosine increasing with module dis- 
placement. Range fifty-oiie point 
eighty-one miles, tangent decreas- 
ing with module displacement. 
Metallic objects on planetary sur- 
face. First estimate of number — 
three hundred sixty-three. Concen- 
tration and consistency of metallic 
elements indicate refining. Analy- 
sis of reflected radiation indicates 
machine-finished exteriors.” 
Targett’s heart began to jolt 
powerfully. “Did you hear that, 
Dave? What does it mean?” 

“It sounds to me as though 
you’ve got your wish — those can’t 
be anything but artifacts.” Sur- 
genor’s voice betrayed no excit- 
ment, but Targett noticed he was

now sitting upright as he made a 
bearing check. “According to 
the reading they must be in those 
hills on the right.” . 

Targett scanned the slowly un- 
folding slopes trembling in the 
yellowish heat haze created by 
Horta. “It looks pretty dead over 
there.” 

“The whole planet is dead— oth- 
erwise Aesop would have noticed 
something during the prelimi- 
nary orbital survey.” 

“Well, let’s go over and take a 
look.” 

Surgenor shook his head. “Ae- 
sop won’t agree to our breaking 
the search pattern unless there’s 
an emergency. It distorts his world 
map.” 

“What?” Targett bounced impa- 
tiently in his seat. “Who cares 
about the world map? Are we sup- 
posed to run straight on and ig- 
nore a real archelogical find? I tell 
you, Dave, if — ’’ He stopped 
speaking as he noticed Surgenor’s 
smile. “You were doing your 
Oldest Member bit again.” 

“I guess I was.” Surgenor 
nodded. “Don’t worry about pass- 
ing up a find. We aren’t 
archeologists, but there's a provi- 
sion in Survey Regulations for 
this kind of thing. As soon as we 
get back to the Sarafand Captain 
Aesop will send a couple of 
modules out again for a closer 
look.” 

“Everybody won't be in on it?” 

“If Aesop thinks it’s important 



he might bring the ship down 
here.” 

“But this has got to be 
important.” Targett gestured 
helplessly towards the hills drift- 
ing by on his right. “Hundreds of 
machine-finished objects just ly- 
ing on the surface. What could 
they be?” 

“Who knows? My guess is that a 
ship put down here, possibly for 
repairs, and dumped a load of un- 
wanted canisters.” 

“Oh?” Such a prosaic 
explanation had not occurred to 
Targett, and he fought to mask his 
disappointment. “Recently?” 

“Depends on what you mean by 
recent. The Sarafand was the first 
Federationship to enter the Horta 
system— and it’s been four- 
thousand years or more since the 
old White Empire withdrew from 
this cluster, so — ” 

“Four-thousand years!” 

Targett experienced a brief 
headiness strangely reminiscent of 
the sensation which had once 
come over him — the time he had 
brought off an eight-throw anti- 
martingale on the gaming tables 
of Parador. This was a new kind 
of gambling — one in which a man 
staked lonely hours of boredom 
as he skimmed across the surfaces 
of dead worlds and the prize was a 
swift, clear look at the crazy spark- 
ling treasures of reality, a hand- 
shake from the ghost of an alien 
being who had been computing his 
way across the ionic tides of space

IF 




before the pyramids were planned. 
Suddenly, and for the first time, 
Targett was glad he had signed on 
with the Cartographical Ser- 
vice — but suppose he was not 
among the group Aesop was go- 
ing to send back to investigate the 
find? 

“Dave/’ he said carefully, “how 
will Aesop select the modules he 
wants to come back here?” 

“Like a computer.” Surgenor 
gave a wry smile. “For an un- 
scheduled foray he likes to use the 
modules which have clocked up the 
least engine hours — and this old 
bus is due for — ” 

“Don't tell me— a complete 
overhaul next month.” 

“Next week.” . 

“That's great,” Targett said bit- 
terly. “Two modules out of six. 
Odds of only two to one against me 
and 1 couldn’t even bring it off. 
With my luck I’d — ” He fell silent 
as he saw the slow grin spreading 
over Surgenor's face. 

“May I make a suggestion?” 
Surgenor kept his gaze straight 
ahead. “Instead of sitting around 
here calculating odds, why don't 
you get suited up and take a walk 
over into those hills? That way—” 
“What? Can you do things like 
that?” 

Surgenor sighed. “I would also 
suggest that you read Survey 
Regulations when you get back. 
Iiach suit is fitted out for an EVA 
of up to fifty hours for precisely 
this — ” 



“Skip all that stuff, Dave — I can 
bone up on regulations later.” 
Targett’s mounting excitement 
overrode his respect for Sur- 
genor’s seniority. “Will Aesop 
clear me to leave the module and 
take a look at — whatever is over 
there?” 

“He ought to — the logistics 
make sense. You could give him 
television coverage and a verbal 
report while I’m taking this mod- 
ule back to the ship. Only one 
module would need to return to 
pick you up. And if your report 
shows the find is worth bringing 
the Sarafand down for, there'll be 
no extra engine time on the mod- 
ules at all.” 

“Let’s talk to Aesop right 
now.” 

“You're sure you want to do 
this, Mike?” Surgenor's eyes had 
become serious. “The Carto- 
graphical Service has an occupa- 
tional disease all to itself — there's 
a tendency for us to confuse the 
map with the territory.” 

“I don’t even know what that 
means.” 

“It means that no amount of 
thinking about a ten-mile walk on 
an alien world can be equated with 
the actual experience. That’s 
why Aesop hasn't' already taken 
the initiative and ordered one of 
us to investigate these ob- 
jects — the Service doesn't require 
a man to walk new ground alone.” 

Targett snorted and pressed the 
TALK button which would con-

ncct him directly to Captain Ae- 
sop, the vast artificial intelli- 
gence which occupied one entire 
deck of the Sarafand.

ODULE FIVE lifted into the 
air, dipped its nose slightly 
and whined away to the north in a 
cloud of brown dust. Targett 
watched it vanish, mildly sur- 
prised at the speed with which all 
sign of the vehicle vanished. He 
took a deep breath of the suit’s 
plastic-smelling air. It was early 
afternoon and he had about six 
hours of daylight to go — ample 
time to reach the group of metal 
objects which lay due east at a dis- 
tance of just over four miles. He 
began to walk toward the hills. 
Horta VII’s atmosphere con- 
tained no trace of oxygen and the 
planet had never known any in- 
digenous life, yet Targett found he 
was unable to keep his eyes from 
scanning the sand underfoot for 
shells and insects. Intellectually 
he could accept that he was tra- 
versing a dead world, but on the in- 
stinctive and emotional level his 
consciousness simply rejected 
the concept. He walked quickly, 
feeling a little self-conscious each 
time the holstered ultralaser pis- 
tol bumped against his thigh. 

“I know you don’t need it,” Sur- 
genor had said patiently, “but it’s 
standard EVA equipment and if 
you don’t wear it you don’t go 
out.” 

10 



The planet’s gravity was close to 
1.5 and by the time Targett neared 
the hills he was sweating freely in 
spite of the suit’s cooling system. 
He unbuckled the pistol— which 
seemed to have maliciously quad- 
rupled its weight — and slung it over 
his shoulder. The ground was be- 
coming increasingly stony and 
on reaching the hills he found they 
were composed largely of naked 
basaltic rock. He sat down on a 
smooth outcropping, glad of the 
chance to rest his legs. When he 
had sipped some cold water from 
the tube that nuzzled against his 
left cheek he pressed the TALK 
button on his communicator. 

“Aesop,” he said, “how far am I 
from the objects?” 

“The nearest is nine hundred 
and twelve yards west of your pre- 
sent position,” Aesop replied 
without hesitation, drawing on 
the data continuously fed to him 
by his own sensors and those in the 
six converging survey modules. 

“Thanks.” 

Targett scanned the slope ahead 
of him. It formed an ill-defined 
ridge a short distance away. From 
there he should be able to see the 
objects, provided they were not 
buried under the accumulated 
dust of forty centuries. 

“How are you making out, 
Mike?” The voice was Surgenor’s. 

“No problems." Targett was 
about to add that he was begin- 
ning to understand the differ- 
ence between the map and the ter- 




IF 




ritory when it dawned on him that 
Surgenor had maintained radio 
silence till then with the deliberate 
intention of making him feel cut 
off. “How about you?” 

“I’ve got decisions to make,” 
Surgenor said comfortably. “I’ll 
be back at the Sarafand in less 
than three hours and the question 
is whether to eat now or wait for a 
proper steak dinner on board. 
What would you do, Mike?” 

“That’s one of those tricky deci- 
sions you have to sort out for your- 
self.” Targett kept his voice level 
with an effort. This was Sur- 
genor’s way of reminding him 
that by waiting a few hours he 
could have done his investigating 
in comfort and on a full stomach. 
As it was, he was going to spend 
an uncomfortable night with 
nothing to keep him going but 
water and surrogate. 

“Yeah— I think I’ll sleep on it. 
See you, Mike.” Surgenor’s voice 
faded into a yawn. 

“See you.” 

Targett rose to his feet with a 
new determination to make his 
private expedition worth while. 
He moved up the slope, being care- 
ful not to slip on the loose surface 
stones and dust which cascaded 
around his ankles at every step. Be- 
yond the ridge the ground leveled 
out for perhaps a mile before ris- 
ing sharply to the rocky spine of 
the hills. The small plateau was 
bounded to the north and south by 
tumbled palisades of boulders. 



almost as if it had been cleared by 
bulldozers. Scattered across the 
level ground — in random group- 
ings — were hundreds of slim black 
cylinders, the nearest only a few 
dozen paces from Targett. They 
were about twenty feet in length 
and tapered at each end. Tar- 
gett’ s heart began a steady, peace- 
ful pounding as it came to him 
that the alien objects certainly 
were not discarded canisters, as 
Surgenor had suggested. He took 
the miniature television camera 
from his belt, plugged it briefly 
into the suit’s powerpack and 
aimed it at the nearest cylinders. 

“Aesop,” he said. “I’ve made 
visual contact.” 

“I’m getting a moderately good 
picture, Michael,” Aesop replied. 

“I’ll go closer.” 

“Do not move,” Aesop com- 
manded sharply. 

T ARGETT froze in the act of 
taking a step forward. “What’s 
the matter?” 

“Perhaps nothing, Michael.” 
Aesop was speaking at his normal 
tempo again. “The picture I’m re- 
ceiving from you would suggest 
that the surfaces of the objects 
are free of dust. Is this correct?” 

“I guess it is.” Targett exa- 
mined the shining black cylin- 
ders, ruefully wondering how he 
had failed to notice their condi- 
tion. They might have been scat- 
tered across the plateau only that 
morning.

“You guess? Does some visual 
defect prevent you from being 
positive?" 

“Don't be funny, Aesop — I'm 
positive. Does it mean the objects 
have been put here recently?" 

“Improbably. Has there been 
any accretion of dust in the 
vicinity of each object?" 

Targett narrowed his eyes into 
the brilliantly reflected sunlight 
and saw that the cylinders were ly- 
ing in cradles of accumulated 
dust, the upper edges of which 
were a few inches clear of the 
black metal. He described what he 
could see. 

‘'Repellent fields," Aesop said. 
“Still effective after a possible 
four thousand years. Itns not nec- 
essary for you to study these ob- 
jects any further. Michael. As 
soon as the planetary survey has 
been completed I shall bring the 
Sarafand to your present loca- 
tion for the purpose of a full in- 
vestigation." 

“Thanks, but I have no inten- 
tion of cooling my heels for four 
or five hours." Targett made his 
voice firm, although he was un- 
certain of how good Aesop was at 
interpreting inflexions. “I’m 
going to take a closer look." 

“I will permit that, provided you 
continue to supply uninter- 
rupted television coverage." 

Targett almost pointed out that, 
with close to three thousand miles 
separating them, the computer 
had no way of imposing its will on 



him, but he suppressed his irrita- 
tion. During his months in the Ser- 
vice he had managed to swallow 
the facts that his crewmates ad- 
dressed the ship's computer as 
“Captain" and obeyed its every 
instruction as though they were 
serving a three-cluster marshal. 
There was no point in blowing up 
about it just when something of 
genuine interest had come along 
to break the routine. 

He crossed the level ground, 
keeping the camera trained 
ahead. And as he walked, some- 
thing about the general appear- 
ance of the cylinders began to 
disturb him. They looked like 
military materiel. Torpedoes, 
perhaps. 

The same thought must have oc- 
curred to Aesop. “Michael; have 
you made a polyrad check of the 
area?" 

“Yes." Targett had not, but he 
held up his left wrist as he spoke, 
examined the suit’s polyrad dial 
and saw it was registering nothing 
unusual. He moved the dial into 
camera view for a second. “All 
clear. Do these things look like tor- 
pedoes to you, Aesop?" 

“They could be anything. Pro- 
ceed." 

Targett, who had been pro- 
ceeding anyway, clamped his 
mouth shut and tried to put Aesop 
out of his* mind. He approached 
the nearest cylinder, marveling 
at its gleaming electrostatic fresh- 
ness.

IF 




“Hold the camera three feet 
from the object,” Aesop said in 
his ear. “Walk around it and re- 
turn to your starting point.” 

“Yes, j/>,” Targett muttered, 
moving crab-wise around the cyl- 
inder. 

O NE end of it tapered almost to 
a point, in the center of which 
was a one-centimeter circular 
hole, reminding him of the muz- 
zle of a rifle. A ring of black glass, 
practically indistinguishable 
from the surrounding metal, was 
located a few inches back from 
the point. The other end was more 
rounded and covered with smaller 
holes like those on a pepper shak- 
er. In the cylinder's mid-section 
were several plates set flush with 
the surface and secured by screws 
of a surprisingly Earthlike de- 
sign. There were no markings of 
any kind. 

“Thank you, Michael — now see 
if you can remove the plates from 
the center section.” 

“Right.” 

Targett was mildly surprised at 
Aesop’s instruction, but he set 
the camera where it could cover 
his actions and unsheathed his 
knife. 

“Just a minute, Mike,” Sur- 
genor’s voice cut in unexpected- 
ly, loud and clear in spite of the 
hundreds of miles between Tar- 
gett and Module Five. “You men- 
tioned torpedoes a minute ago. 
What do those things look like?” 



“Dave,” Targett said wearily, 
“why don’t you go back to sleep?” ' 
“I’ve got indigestion — now tell 
me what you’ve got there.” 

Targett described the cylinders 
quickly and with a growing feeling 
of exasperation. His projected 
stroll down the centuries, among 
the relics of an ancient civilization, 
was somehow getting him more 
tangled than ever in the petty re- 
strictions of the present. 

“Do you mind if I get on with 
the job?” he concluded. 

“I don’t think you should touch 
those things, Mike.” 

“Why not? They look like tor- 
pedoes. But if there were any dan- 
ger Aesop would have warned me 
off.” 

“Would he?” Surgenor’s voice 
was hard. “Don’t forget that Ae- 
sop is a computer — ” 

“You don’t need to tell me that. 
You guys are the ones who per- 
sonalize him.” 

“ — and therefore thinks in a 
very cold, very logical manner. 
Didn’t you notice his sudden 
change in attitude just no\y? At 
first he wanted you to stay clear of 
the objects — now he’s telling you 
to take one apart.” 

“Which proves he thinks it’s 
safe,” Targett said. 

“Which proves he thinks it could 
be dangerous, you bonehead. 
Listen, Mike, this little jaunt of 
yours has turned out rather dif- 
ferently from what any of us ex- 
pected and, since you were the one

who volunteered to go out on the 
limb, Aesop is quite prepared to 
let you saw down the tree behind 
you.” 

Targett shook his head, al- 
though there was nobody to see 
him. “If Aesop thought there was 
any risk he would order me away 
from here.” 

“Let's ask him," Surgenor 
snapped. “Aesop, why did you in- 
struct Mike to remove the casing 
from one of those cylinders?” 

“To permit inspection of its in- 
terior,” Aesop replied. 

Surgenor sighed audibly. “Sor- 
ry. What was the reasoning behind 
your permitting Mike to proceed 
with this investigation alone 
instead of waiting for the arrival of 
the customary two modules or the 
entire ship?” 

“The objects in question resem- 
ble torpedoes, tanks or bombs,” 
Aesop replied without hesitation, 
“but the complete absence of elec- 
trical or mechanical interfaces sug- 
gests that they may be self-con- 
tained automated devices. Their 
contamination repellant systems 
are still active, so there is a possi- 
bility that other systems are either 
active or capable of being acti- 
vated. If the objects prove to be ro- 
bot weapons it is obviously bet- 
ter that they be examined initial- 
ly by one man rather than by four 
or twelve.” 

“QED,” Surgenor commented 
drily. “There you are, Mike. Cap- 
tain Aesop is a staunch advocate of 



the greatest good of the greatest 
number.” 

“I cannot risk the ship.” 

He can’t risk the ship, Mike. 
Now that you know the score, you 
are entitled to refuse to chance 
going near those objects until a 
team arrives with full probe in- 
strumentation.” 

“I don’t think there’s any risk 
worth mentioning,” Targett said 
steadily. “Besides, everything Ae- 
sop said makes sense to me. I’m 
going ahead.” 

A nalyzing his own feelings, 

Targett was surprised to dis- 
cover that he was slightly disap- 
pointed in Aesop. He had always 
objected to personalizing the com- 
puter, yet in his heart he must have 
regarded Aesop as a benign entity 
who looked out for Targett’s wel- 
fare with greater scrupulousness 
than could have been expected of a 
human skipper. Possibly there was 
something there a psychoanalyst 
could get his teeth into, but his im- 
mediate concern was with the in- 
terior of the nearest cylinder. 
He unclipped the heavy back- 
pack, set it on the ground and 
kneeled beside the sleek black tor- 
pedo. 

The screws holding the mid-sec- 
tion plates had Y-shaped slots, 
which did not provide a good pur- 
chase for the point of his knife but 
were spring-loaded and turned 
easily when ’depressed. He lifted 
the first plate carefully, exposing a 



14 



IF 




mass of components and circuit- 
ry, much of which appeared to be 
duplicated and arranged sym- 
metrically about a central spine. 
The conduits were drab and not 
color-coded, but looked fresh 
enough to have been installed the 
previous day. Targett, who was 
not an engineer, suddenly felt a 
profound respect for the long-de- 
parted beings who had created 
the cylinders. Within five min- 
utes he had stripped off all the 
curved plates and laid them in a 
row beside the cylinder body. An 
inspection of the complex interi- 
or told him nothing about the ob- 
ject’s function, except that a 
mechanism in the sharper end 
had the hard uncompromising 
lines he associated with machine 
guns. 

“Hold the camera about two feet 
from the object,” Aesop in- 
structed, “and move along its en- 
tire length.” 

Targett did as he had been told. 
“How’s that? This looks like an 
engine section but the metal looks 
queer — a bit crumbly.” 

“That would be caused by ni- 
trogen absorption associated with 
— ” Aesop stopped speaking in 
mid-sentence, a strangely human 
mannerism which Targett had 
never known the computer to ex- 
hibit before. 

“Aesop?” 

“Here is an instruction you must 
obey instantly.” Aesop’s voice 
was preternaturally sharp. 



“Scan your surroundings. If you 
see a rock formation that would 
give you protection against ma- 
chine rifle fire — go to it immedi- 
ately!” 

“What’s the matter?” Targett 
glanced around the shimmering 
plateau. 

“Don’t ask questions,” Surgen- 
or’s voice cut in. “Do as Aesop 
says. Run for cover.” 

“But—” 

Targett’s voice faded as his pe- 
ripheral vision picked up a sudden 
movement. He turned toward it 
and saw that — in the center of the 
plateau — one of the hundreds of 
cylinders had reared its sharp end 
at an angle into the air. It was 
swaying slowly and blindly, as 
though supported by a loose wire. 
Targett gaped at it for a moment, 
filled with an almost superstitious 
dread, then ran north toward the 
nearest barricade of rock. Ham- 
pered by the suit and the extra 
gravity, he found it impossible to 
pick up any real speed. On his 
right the cylinder spiraled lazily in- 
to the air like a mythological crea- 
ture awakening from millennia of 
slumber. It drifted in his direction. 

Two others stirred in their dusty 
cradles. Targett tried to move fast- 
er but felt as if he were waist deep 
in syrup. Ahead he saw a black tri- 
angular hole formed by tilted slabs 
of rock. He swerved toward it. 

T HE sky to his right was clear 
again, giving him the impres-

sion the cylinder had vanished. 
Then he saw it moving around be- 
hind him, foreshortening, aiming 
itself. His thighs pumped harder in 
the nightmarish slow motion and 
the dark opening swung crazily 
ahead, but too far away. He knew 
he was going to be late. 

He threw himself at the open- 
ing — just as a massive hammer 
sledged ferociously into his back. 
The television camera spun from 
his hand as he was lifted off his feet 
and flung into the space between 
the rocks. Astounded at finding 
himself still alive, Targett bur- 
rowed desperately for cover. 
The triangular space proved long 
enough to take his whole body. He 
squirmed into it, moaning with 
panic at the thought of- another 
bullet finding him at any instant. 

Vm alive , he thought numbly, 
buthow? 

He slid a gloved hand around to 
the lower part of his back where the 
bullet had struck, felt an un- 
familiar jagged edge of metal. His 
probing fingers discovered a 
crumpled, boxlike object — the 
ruins of his oxygen generator. 

He started to reach for the back : 
pack containing the spare gener- 
ator, then remembered the pack 
was lying out on the plateau 
where he had set it down before 
going to work on the cylinder. 
He clawed feverishly at the con- 
fining rock until he had reversed 
his position, then peered outside. 
The small segment of open sky he 



could see was crossed and re- 
crossed with the black silhouettes 
of torpedoes in flight. Targett 
inched forward a little for a bet- 
ter view. His jaw sagged as he saw 
that the torpedoes had taken to 
the air in hundreds, swarming si- 
lently upward, their shadows 
rippling over brownish dust and 
rocks. Even as he watched, a few 
laggards angled their noses into 
the air, swung groggily for a mo- 
ment and drifted up to join their 
fellows in the circulating cloud. A 
slight fold in the ground made it 
impossible for him to see where 
the backpack lay, or if the cylin- 
der on which he had worked had al- 
so taken flight. He raised his head 
slightly and fell back amid a sud- 
den shower of rock splinters and 
dust. The banshee howl or rico- 
chets left no doubt in his mind that 
several of the torpedoes had 
noted his movement and used their 
guns. 

“Report on your position, Mi- 
chael,” Aesop’s voice seemed to 
come from another world. 

“My position isn’t too good,” 
Targett said hoarsely, trying to- 
control his breathing. “These 
things seem to be robot hunters 
fitted out with machine rifles. The 
lot of them are airborne 
now — perhaps the radiation 
from my television camera trig- 
gered them off — and they’re 
swarming about like mosquitoes. 
I’m hiding out under some rocks 
but—” 



16 



IF 




“Stay where you are. I will have 
the Sarafand there in less than an 
hour.” 

“That’s no good, Aesop. One of 
the torpedoes took a shot at me as 
I was getting in here. The suit isn’t 
punctured, but my oxygenerator 
is out of action.” 

“Use the spare from your pack,” 
Surgenor put in before Aesop 
could reply. 

“I can’t.” Targett made the 
strange discovery that he felt em- 
barrassed rather than afraid. 
“The pack’s lying out in the open 
and I can’t get at it.” 

“But that gives you only—” Sur- 
genor paused. “You’ll have to 
reach the pack, Mike.” 

Targett could feel his lungs be- 
gin to labor as the suit’s residual 
oxygen was depleted. 

“That’s what I was thinking.” 
“Look, perhaps the torpedoes 
respond only to sudden move- 
ment. If you crawled out very 
slowly — ” 

“Hypothesis incorrect,” Aesop 
interupted. “My analysis of the 
sensor circuitry in the torpedo 
which Michael opened indicates 
that it was a duplex system, both 
channels of which use movement 
and heat for target identification. 
Any exposure of his body would be 
certain to draw more fire.” 

“It already has — I tried to poke 
my head out of this hole a minute 
ago,” Targett said. “I almost lost 
it.” 

“That shows my conclusion 



about the sensor circuitry was ac- 
curate, which in turn — ” 

“We haven’t time to listen to you 
congratulating yourself, Aesop.” 
Surgenor’s voice crashed in the 
suit’s radio. “Mike, have you tried 
your sidearm on them?” 

Ill 

T ARGETT reached for the ul- 
tralaser, which was still slung 
over his shoulder, then pulled his 
hand back. “It wouldn’t help, 
Dave. There are hundreds of those 
things buzzing around out there 
and an ultralaser pistol holds— how 
many charges?” 

“Let’s see. Twenty-six.” 

“So what’s the point of even try- 
ing?” r 

“Maybe there isn’t any point, 
Mike, but are you just going to lie 
there and suffocate? Blast a few of 
them at least.” 

“David Surgenor,” Aesop inter- 
upted. “I instruct you to remain 
silent while I deal with this emer- 
gency.” 

“Deal with it?” Targett felt an 
illogical stirring of his former blind 
faith in Aesop. “All right. What do 
you want me to do?” 

“Can you see any of the tor- 
pedoes without endangering 
yourself?” 

“Yes.” Targett glanced at the 
triangular area of sky as a black ci- 
gar-shape drifted across it. “Only 
one at a time, though.” 

“That is sufficient. Your record

shows that you are a good marks- 
man. I want you to use your side- 
arm on one of the torpedoes. Hit 
it.” 

“What's the point?” Targett's 
brief, irrational hope dissolved' in- 
to anger and raw panic. “I've got 
twenty-six charges and there are 
three hundred of those robots out 
there.” 

“Three-h u nd red-and-sixty-t wo, 
to be precise,” Aesop said. “Now 
listen to my instructions and obey 
them without further delay. Direct 
an ultralaser burst against one of 
the torpedoes. Hit it as close to 
the nose section as possible and 
describe the effects of your action.” 

“You smug — ” Realizing the fu- 
tility of trying to insult a com- 
puter, Targett wrenched the ul- 
tralaser free of its holster and 
flipped the tubeless scopesight up 
into position. 

He set the sight for low magnifi- 
cation and wriggled around in the 
narrow space between the rocks 
until he was in a reasonably good 
firing position. The controlled 
breathing essential for high-ac- 
curacy shooting was impossi- 
ble — his lungs were working like 
bellows in the suit’s stale air — but 
the torpedoes were a relatively 
easy target. He waited until one 
came questing across his segment 
of sky, put the cross-hairs on its 
conical nose section and squeezed 
the trigger. As the first capsule in 
the weapon’s magazine yielded its 
energy a quarter-second burst of 



violet brilliance lanced out, flar- 
ing briefly on the torpedoe’s nose. 
The black cylinder seemed to fal- 
ter slightly, then recover and 
cruise out of sight, apparently un- 
harmed. Targett felt perspiration 
prickling out on his forehead. In- 
credible as it seemed, he — Mi- 
chael Targett, the most import- 
ant individual in the uni- 
verse — was going to die, just like 
all the anonymous beings who had 
gone before him. 

“I hit one,” he said through 
numb lips. “Right on the nose. It 
just flew on as if nothing had hap- 
pened.” 

“Was there any searing or scar- 
ring of the metal?” 

“I don’t think so. I’m seeing 
them in silhouette, so I couldn’t 
be sure, though.” 

“You say the torpedo flew on as 
though nothing had happened,” 
Aesop persisted. “Think carefully, 
Michael— was there no reaction at 
all?” 

“Well, it seemed to wobble for a 
fraction of a second, but — ” 

“Just as I expected,” Aesop 
commented. “The internal ar- 
rangement of the torpedo you ex- 
amined suggested it had a duplex 
sensory and control system. The 
new evidence confirms this.” 
“Damn you, Aesop,” Targett 
whispered. “I thought you were 
trying to help me but you were just 
gathering more data. From now 
on, do your own dirty work — I've 
retired from the Service.” 



18 



IF 




“The ultralaser radiation would 
have been sufficient to burn out the 
prime sensory inputs,” Aesop con- 
tinued unperturbed, “causing 
the back-up system to take over. 
Another direct hit on the same 
torpedo would make it fall out of 
control and the probability is 
high that the impact would cause 
catastrophic failure of the mo- 
tor casing, which appears to have 
deteriorated. The high level of 
prolonged nondirectional radi- 
ation normally associated with 
failure in a motor of this design 
would in turn be sufficient to 
overload both sensory channels 
in the other torpedoes, causing 
them—” 

“That’s it!” Targett felt a fierce 
pang of relief— it faded almost as 
quickly as it had come. He fought 
to keep his voice level. “Except 
that 1 could see no mark on the tor- 
pedo I hit — and if I try to poke my 
face out for a better look I’ll get it 
blown off. Maybe that would be 
the best thing that could happen— 
at least it would be quick.” 

ET me say something here, 
-LrfAesop,” came Surgenor’s 
voice. “Listen, Mike — you still 
have a chance. You’ve got twenty- 
five energy capsules left in your 
magazine. Blast away at the tor- 
pedoes as they go by and maybe 
you’ll burn the same one twice.” 

“Thanks, Dave.” A gray mood 
of resignation settled over Targett 
as he realized what he had to do. 



“1 appreciate your concern, but 
remember I’m the gambler in 
this outfit. Twenty-six into three- 
sixty-two put the odds at about 
thirteen to one against me right at 
the start. Thirteen’s a bad number 
and I don’t feel very lucky.” 

“A superstitious gambler’s a 
loser, Mike. Let Aesop figure your 
odds. It’s your only chance.” 

“Not the only one.” Targett 
gathered his legs beneath him in 
preparation for violent action. 
“I’m a pretty good shot with radi- 
ation weapons. My best bet 
would be to get outside fast — out 
where I can track one of the tor- 
pedoes long enough to take two 
shots at it.” 

“Don’t try it, Mike,” Surgenor 
said urgently. 

“Sorry.” Targett tensed himself 
and edged forward. “My mind 

is—” 

“Your mind appears to be con- 
fused,” Aesop cut in. “Possibly 
due to oxygen starvation. Have 
you forgotten that you dropped 
the television camera outside 
your shelter?” 

Targett hesitated in the act of 
diving forward. “The camera? Can 
you see the swarm?” 

“Not all of it, but enough to let 
me follow individual torpedoes 
for a considerable portion of 
their circuit. I will instruct you 
when to fire and by timing your 
shots to match the general circu- 
lation rate of the swarm we can 
bring the probability of a second

hit on one torpedo close to 
unity.” 

“All right, Aesop— you win.” 
Targett settled down again, bur- 
dened by the dull certainty that 
nothing he could do would make 
any difference to the situation. 
His breathing had become rapid 
and shallow as his lungs rejected 
their own waste products. His 
hands were clammy inside their 
gloves. He raised the sidearm and 
peered through its sight. 

“Begin firing at will to initiate 
the sequence.” Aesop’s voice came 
faintly through the roaring in 
Targett’sears. 

“Right.” He steadied the wea- 
pon, waited until a torpedo 
drifted across his segment of sky 
and directed a burst of energy 
onto its nose section. The tor- 
pedo wavered for an instant, then 
flew on. Targett repeated the se- 
quence again and again, always 
'with the same result, until the pile 
of expended capsules spat out by 
the weapon numbered more than 
a dozen. 

“Where are you, Aesop?” he 
breathed. “You’re not helping 
me. 

“The ultralaser radiation leaves 
no visible marks on the surfaces of 
the torpedoes, so 1 am forced to 
work on a purely statistical basis,” 
Aesop said. “I now have sufficient 
data to enable me to predict their 
movements with a tolerable de- 
gree of accuracy.” 

“Then start doing it.” 



There was a slight pause. “Each 
time I say, ‘Now — ’ fire at the next 
torpedo appearing in your field 
of view.” 

“I’m waiting.” Targett blinked 
to clear his vision. Bright-rimmed 
black spots had begun to dance 
across it. 

“Now.” 

A torpedo appeared an instant 
later and Targett squeezed the trig- 
ger. The ultralaser ray raked 
along the nose section — but after 
an initial tremor the black cylin- 
der drifted steadily out of view 
without changing direction. 

“Now.” 

Targett fired again, with the 
same result. 

“Now.” 

Once again the beam of energy 
flicked across a torpedo— with no 
effect. 

“This isn’t working out too 
well.” Targett focused his eyes with 
difficulty on the indicator on the 
butt of his weapon. “I’m down to 
eight charges. I’m beginning to 
think I ought to go ahead with my 
own idea while I — ” 

“You are wasting valuable time, 
Michael. Now.” 

Targett squeezed the trigger and 
another torpedo drifted heedlessly 
on, effectively unharmed. 

“Now.” 

Hopelessly, Targett fired again. 
The torpedo had passed out of 
sight before it dawned on him that 
perhaps it had begun to change di- 
rection.

IF 




“Aesop," he managed to say, “I 
think maybe—" 

He heard a dull explosion and 
the triangular segment of sky 
turned a blinding white. Light 
seared Targett’s eyes before the 
helmet filters automatically 
clicked into place. The brilliance 
continued unabated for seconds. 
He imagined it burning out the 
primary and back-up sensors on 
the swarming robots, which would 
in turn blunder down and — 

J UST in time Targett jammed 
his eyes shut and buried his 
head in his arms. When the pro- 
longed rumble of explosions and 
the almost palpable flood of bril- 
lance had died away he crawled out 
from under the rocks and forced 
his legs to accept his weight. He 
opened his eyes cautiously. The 
plateau was littered with hundreds 
of inert torpedoes, their motor 
compartments glowing red, vapor- 
ing. Several of the torpedoes 
were still airborne but they paid 
no attention to him as he ran, 
weaving drunkenly, toward the 
spot where he had left the back- 
pack. On the way across the pla- 
teau the thought occurred to him 
that one of the torpedoes could 
have landed right on the pack, but 
he found it lying safely beside the 
stripped-down cylinder, which 
apparently had not flown. He 
'opened it with trembling fingers, 
took out the oxygenerator and 
experienced a moment of exqui- 



site dread as the ruined generator 
refused to let itself be detached 
from the suit’s breather hole. With 
the last dregs of his strength he 
wrenched it off, clicked the re- 
placement into position and lay 
down to await oxygen. 

“Mike? Are you all right?" 

Targett breathed deeply. “I’m 
all right, Dave. Captain Aesop 
got me through." 

“Did you say Captain?" 

“I said Captain." Targett rose to 
his feet and surveyed the littered 
battlefield upon which he and a 
distant computer had van- 
quished an enemy host which had 
lain in ambush for four thousand 
years. In all probability he would 
never know what the torpedoes’ 
original purpose had been, or why 
they had been dumped on 
HortaVII— but his taste for ar- 
cheology seemed to have faded. It 
was sufficient just to be alive in 
the present. As he scanned the in- 
credible scene one of the torpe- 
does which was still aloft flew 
blindly into a ridge more than a 
mile away. The resultant explo- 
sion drenched the plateau with ra- 
diance. 

Targett shielded his eyes. “There 
goes another one, Aesop." 

“Your meaning is not clear to 
me, Michael," Aesop replied. 

“Another torpedo, of course. 
Didn’t you see the flash?" 

“No. The television camera is 
not functioning." 

“Oh?" Targett glanced towards

his former hiding place, where the 
camera had fallen. “Perhaps all 
those explosions burned it out.” 
“No.” Aesop paused. “Trans- 
missions ceased when you dropped 
the camera. There is a good prob- 
ability that the switch got jarred to 
the off position.” 

“Very likely. 1 was moving — ” 
Targett stopped speaking as a 
disturbing thought occurred to 
him. “Then you lied to me. You 
weren’t able to track the torpe- 
does—” 

“That is correct.” 

“But you were telling me when 
to fire. How did you know I would 
hit one of the torpedoes twice?” 

“I didn’t.” Aesop’s voice was 
precise, unruffled. “This is some- 
thing you in particular should 
understand, Michael. I simply took 
a chance.” 

(( A LL this is great stuff for my 
Abook, Mike.” Clifford Pol- 
len’s reedy voice was pitched high 
with excitement as he leaned 
across the mess table on the 
Sarafand, “There were three-sixty- 
two torpedoes skimming around 
and you had twenty-six shots. That 
means Aesop staked your life on 
odds of about thirteen to one— and 
the gamble came off!” 

“You’ll never make a successful 
gambler, Clifford.” Targett 
smiled pityingly as he cut up a 
king-sized steak. “You’ve no idea 
of how to calculate odds.” 

Pollen looked offended. “I can 
perform a simple calculation. 

IF

Twenty-six into three-sixty-two — ” 
“Has nothing to do with the 
actual mathematics of the 
situation, my friend. It was nec- 
essary for me to hit one of the tor- 
pedoes twice, right?” 

“Right,” Pollen said grudgingly. 
“My first shot could hit any 
torpedo. There was one chance in 
three-six-two that my second shot 
would hit the same torpedo — or 
three-six-one in three-six-two that 
it would not. For the third shot to 
coincide with either of the first 
two, it was two chances in three- 
six-two — or three-sixty in three- 
six-two that it wouldn’t — and so 
on. In this sort of calculation it’s 
easier to work out the probability 
against something happening, so 
all you have to do is multiply three- 
six-one over three-six-two by three- 
sixty over three-six-two, and so on 
right up to the odds against my last 
shot which would have been three- 
three-seven over three-six-two. 
Multiply it all out and you get 
odds of around two to one that I 
would hit a torpedo twice. It 
wasn’t much of a gamble, really.” 
“That’s hard to believe.” 

“Work it out for yourself.” 
Targett put a piece of steak into 
his mouth and chewed apprecia- 
tively. “It’s a good example of the 
difficulty of judging complex 
probabilities by common sense.” 
Pollen shook his head. “It’s too 
complicated for me.” 

“That’s why you’d never make a 
successful gambler.” 



Targett smiled again as he 
worked on his steak. He did not 
mention the fact that his own 
common sense had been outraged 
by the mathematics of probability, 
or that it had taken a long and 
tedious conversation with Aesop 
on a private link, after all danger 
was past, to convince him of the 
truth. And he would never men- 
tion the cold, lonely feeling which 
had come over him when he gen- 
uinely realized that Aesop — be- 
hind all the illusions — was simply 
a logic machine. At one point, 
wedged between the rocks, it had 
dawned on him that it would have 
been more comforting, while 
wandering on alien worlds, to 
address Aesop as “Captain”, and 
to think of him as a superhuman 
being who never came down from 
his isolated command post on the 
Sara/amTs computer deck. 

“We’ll be putting down on 
Parador at the end of this survey,” 
Dave Surgenor said from the 
opposite side of the table. “Are 
you going to give us a practical 
demonstration of how a successful 
gambler operates?” 

“I don’t think so.” Targett put 
another forkful of steak into his 
mouth. “The syndicates who run 
the gambling houses are probably 
sneaky enough to use computers 
to calculate the odds." 

He glanced at the nearest 
computer terminal and raised his 
cup of coffee. “No disrespect to 
Captain Aesop, of course.” •

I 

AVENSHAW stood against 
the wall of the railroad station 
in San Francisco. There was a 
long, withdrawn, melancholy 
honk down the tracks in the windy 
sunshine. Squashed popcorn 
paved the floor, all the glass was 
grimy, a quickshot bar with pain- 
fully exotic decor usurped a sec- 
tion of the lobby. Only the maga- 
zine stand on the platform was 
bright and clean. A chubby station 
guard with a Fu Manchu mus- 
tache ambled to the gates. Raven- 
shaw decided one efficiency de- 
rived from the shambles: no one 
would lounge here by choice. 

General Craddock brought up 
the rear of the hustling commuter 
crowd. He said, “Good morning,” 
and didn’t say another word until 
they had driven through the fac- 
tories to the 5th Street on-ramp 
and were into thick traffic on the 
Bay Bridge approach. Then: “I 
would not choose to live at any 
other time, but tell me this, Ar- 
leigh, why do some very pretty girls 
at Stanford dress like refugees 
from a Ukranian potato bog?” 

“To match their young men as 
romantic vagabonds.” 

The general snorted. “Roman- 
tic?” 

“Dictionary says imbued or 
dominated by idealism.” Raven- 
shaw followed the great arc of the 
suspension cables with his eyes. 
“Irrational idealism is a starv- 



ing snake finding its own tail 
around a tree.” 

Craddock took off his black- 
rimmed glasses and rubbed the 
bridge of his nose. “You have a 
pretty way with words,” he said, 
“but watch your tongue when we 
meet the think-tank.” 

“Yessir,” said Ravenshaw. “Be- 
sides Rand Corporation and Sys- 
tems Development and the Hud- 
son Institute, what is a think- 
tank?” 

“Throw ’em a problem and they 
bark like a herd of seals — a condi- 
tioned reflex — how do I know? I 
never met one before. I take a dim 
view of the whole thing.” They 
were running downhill from the 
anchor block of the twin suspen- 
sion spans. It was a sparkling day, 
brisk and sunny, but Craddock 
was in a heavy fog of thought. 
“This outfit is supposed to be 
unique. They don’t make egregious 
pronouncements. It’s a club with 
a clubhouse. Very exclusive. 
They pick their own members. 
You’ve got to have a pretty good 
introduction to meet them.” 

“How’s their batting average?” 

“I asked that question. About 
eight-eighty, but a lot of the work 
is not susceptible to percentage 
analysis. There’s another yard- 
stick, and that’s the hundred 
thousand dollars they got for 
investment fifteen years ago when 
they cranked up this brain ma- 
chine. They have something over 
seven million in the kitty now.”

IF 




“Wow,” said Ravenshaw, “a 
bunch of financial experts.” 
They rumbled through the Goat 
Island Tunnel and onto the can- 
tilever span. 

“They’re a bunch of 
generalists,” said Craddock, “not 
nuts-and-boltsers. But anyone 
who doesn’t pay attention to 
money is obviously not quite 
bright. One of the secondary ob- 
jectives of this group was to 
become self-sustaining — and they 
are that.” 

“Why have we got to talk with 
them?” 

“Because the man said so. While 
there are no fingers but my own in 
the day-to-day pie, I have author- 
ity to which I respond. Authority 
wants us to meet with the wise 
men.” 

The East Bay spread out ahead 
of them, wind-polished and bright. 
Ravenshaw automatically found 
the Campanile on the Berkeley 
campus and the tall buildings of 
Oakland with the skyline hills be- 
yond. There was no question in his 
mind that the Bay Area was 
among the most dramatic postcard 
pictures in the world, but he ig- 
nored it today. 

“Complete disclosure?” he 
asked. 

“Not on your life!” snapped 
Craddock. “The arguments 
about honesty and open dealing 
are byproducts of a mistaken ap- 
preciation of the nature of 
things. We’ll put a hypothetical 



question to these people and see 
what happens.” 

Ravenshaw angled through traf- 
fic onto the Bayshore Freeway 
north. “Well, sir, who are they? 
How do you make a think-tank?” 

“In this case, the man in 
Washington had some discretion- 
ary funds tucked away after the 
Korean War. It occurred to him 
that wise old men could be re- 
cycled like used copper wire. It 
was a tough job, because how do 
you evaluate wisdom? What he 
did was pick a couple of anchor 
men and let them do the recruit- 
ing. Questionnaires went out to a 
wide spectrum of groups, the Na- 
tional Association of Manufac- 
turers, the Retail Clerks, the 
Geophysical Union, the Benevo- 
lent and Protective Order of Elks, 
the Farm Bureau, the Amalga- 
mated Pretzel Benders, the Amer- 
ican Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science — you name it and 
they got an inquiry over a hot-line 
signature. Give us five names in 
your outfit,' give us five names 
outside, of the best general con- 
sultants you’ve ever come across. 
Out of eight thousand names, six 
hundred were mentioned more 
than four times. A grading scale 
was set up and the number cut 
down to just under a hundred. The 
anchor men interviewed these peo- 
ple and twenty were offered jobs. 
Eight accepted. They are a hard- 
nose bunch. I’ve seen a couple of 
their recommendations and have a

good opinion of their ability.' 9 

“But you don’t trust them/’ said 
Ravenshaw. He turned onto the 
university off-ramp. 

“Stop after the next light/’ said 
Craddock. “Park the car. I want 
to throw a little dust in the air. I 
want to obfuscate things a little.’’ 
He brooded as they crossed San 
Pablo and Ravenshaw pulled to 
the curb. “Trust them? I trust them 
to do what they want to do. 1 can 
nail responsibility upstairs, but 
it’s a bitter exercise to fix blame 
when the horse is gone.’’ 

R AVENSHAW asked sudden- 
ly, “Do you see any end to 
this?” 

He meant the entire perplexing 
problem of the infinite worlds he 
had stumbled into when General 
Craddock had pulled him out of 
Vietnam to head Wide Blue 
Yonder, Inc. 

Craddock did not misunderstand 
him. “I see dozens of unaccept- 
able solutions and very few I like. 
Arleigh, I used to go to the Satur- 
day afternoon movies when I was 
a boy. In one serial a goat ate what 
they called a ‘biscuit bomb’ and 
followed the hero around. The 
caption read: ‘Tick-tick, tick- 
tick.’” At the time my sympathy 
was not with the goat. Now, with 
this funny feeling in my stom- 
ach — ” His attention was caught 
by a girl walking toward them. 
She was in a benny, a maxicoat 
from the Salvation Army. Crad- 



dock sighed. “Will hemlines go up 
again in our time?” 

Ravenshaw pursued his thought 
further. “I could go back to ac- 
tive duty— hide out in a jungle 
war,” he said tentatively. 

“Cut and run? Turn back the 
clock? Cop out? Stop the world, I 
want to get off and spit?” Crad- 
dock pulled his suitcase from the 
back seat and opened it. He 
slammed it shut again. 

“Ravenshaw, you and I are 
lucky beyond the dreams of for- 
tune. We stand at a hingepoint of 
history. How we act, what kind of 
men we are, is a question of weight 
and import, [ thought I was a for- 
tunate man, being placed to write 
a footnote to a footnote. Now it’s 
large type in the main copy. Very 
sobering. We are involved in af- 
fairs of genuine consequence.’’ 

Ravenshaw nodded doubtfully. 

“And if there’s any constant but 
change, it’s Start From Now,” 
Craddock went on. Tattoo that 
on your heart. I believe in sins of 
comission and to hell with virtue 
by default.” 

“Yessir,” said Ravenshaw. 

“Right,” said Craddock. He 
turned his attention to a large, 
leather-covered shaving kit from 
his case. He took an ivory tooth- 
pick from his breast pocket and 
stuck it into one of the covered 
hinges. He turned the kit upside 
down and pulled one snap. He 
looked at his watch. “I also be- 
lieve in a few small precautions,”

IF 




he said mildly. “One minute for- 
ty — ” he pulled the other 
S nap— “and here are your papers, 
Mr. Bill Quintard. Go through 
your pockets. Match books, laun- 
dry lists, the rental contract for 
this car, wallet, the works into the 
kit. Got a label in your coat?” 
“Eddie Bauer in Seattle, out- 
door gear and goosedown gar- 
ments, a national mail-order 
house that imports Harris tweed.” 
The general nodded and 
Ravenshaw read the letters ad- 
dressed to Bill Quintard, checked 
the address book and put three 
scraps of notes into his pockets 
along with a swizzle stick labeled 
Plainsboro Jughandle with a lit- 
tle green mermaid on top. In the 
wallet, his picture was on an ID 
card from the James Forrestal 
Research Center. 

“Do I show off this stuff?” 

“It’s subliminal support. I am 
Marcus Holloman and I am your 
boss. Be secretarial and a little 
bodyguardish. Questions?” 

“Why did you say a minute-forty 
when I made it a minute-ten?” 
“Complete disclosure? Hell no. 
If you got smart and' opened this 
case, you’d get fogged with ethyl 
mercaptan plus an interesting 
dye that usually wears off in six 
weeks. Also, an acid eats the 
papers inside.’’ The general grin- 
ned. “Other questions?” 

“What is the think-tank called?” 
“Cassandra Investment Compa- 
ny.” 



“I can’t believe it,” said Raven- 
shaw. He started the engine. “Are 
we off in a blizzard of skunk?” 
Craddock put on a pair of 
glasses with thin gold rims. They 
gave him a mild, scholarly air. He 
whistled the first notes of the Air 
Force Academy Song and Raven- 
shaw pulled into the traffic. 



II 

T HE building was modern non- 
descript, with a row of thirty- 
foot arches filled with glass. An old 
five-story, brick apartment house 
stood behind it. To the left of the 
lobby was an open floor with desks, 
secretaries and business ma- 
chines. To the right were stairs to 
the mezzanine, a guard in uni- 
form, vaults and private offices. 
And a pretty girl. 

“My name’s Holloman. Mr. 
Quintard and I have an appoint- 
ment.” 

“Yes, sir.” She ticked their 
names on a list. “John, will you 
take these gentlemen to the ele- 
vator.” 

They followed the guard to a 
door in the rear and around a cor- 
ner. The hall was too deep by 
twenty feet, Ravenshaw noted. 
They were in the brick apartment 
house. The guard used a key at the 
elevator and pushed the button 
for them. When the door opened 
they stepped into a reception 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD

room between chromed poles two 
inches in diameter set in foot- 
square boxes. There was an 
immediate bizz-abizz-bizz noise. 
The man walking to meet them 
stopped in his tracks. He waited 
until another man appeared from 
'a side door. 

“As you know, gentlemen, this is 
a sensitive area. Will you please 
empty your pockets onto the 
desk.” He was urbane, competent 
and sincere. Craddock had a pock- 
etful of change and Ravenshaw had 
his four-inch stock knife. On invi- 
tation they stepped back between 
the poles and the buzzer was silent. 
The man examined their creden- 
tials. They retrieved their belong- 
ings and were escorted down a 
cork-floored corridor to a pair of 
disguised fire doors with top qual- 
ity panic hardware. 

There is nothing ostentatious 
about a dead solid floor and dead 
quiet ventilation except both are 
as rare as the owner who can af- 
ford them. The room Craddock 
and Ravenshaw entered was 
equally low key, but the carpet 
was wool of theater quality, guar- 
anteed to show no wear after a mil- 
lion people had tromped on it. The 
egg-crate lighting probably did 
not vary ten lumins in any part of 
the room and the bookcases were 
solid oak of meticulous crafts- 
manship. There were no windows, 
there was no fireplace, and the 
chairs and tables had a well-main- 
tained and well-used appearance 



with no offensive smell of cedar 
or lemon oil. 

Two groups of men were gossip- 
ing. A gray man was consulting a 
London Times Atlas on a stand. 
Another fellow had his hands 
cupped over his eyes in a deep 
chair. A third man came to greet 
Craddock and Ravenshaw. He 
had a head like a patent-leather 
owl, with close-set ears and black 
Irair too flat and polished to be 
anything but real. 

“I’m Swafford Jain,’’ he said, 
“moderator for this month. I hope 
our security didn’t bother you. I’m 
convinced precautions are pro- 
tective to us and not primarily di- 
rected to our visitors. Mr. Hollo- 
man and Mr. Quintard, right? 
Coffee? Later, then. We’ve found it 
works best to brace the board with 
the question and socialize with a 
common background. Agreed?” 
His eyes were as direct as a living 
owl’s and, to Ravenshaw’s pleas- 
ure, he swiveled his head on fixed 
shoulders. 

He led them to chairs at the end 
of the room behind a low table 
with a fresh bouquet of single 
roses. He pushed aside an air copy 
of The Economist and rapped on 
the table with his knuckles. The 
groups broke up and Jain plunged 
directly into business. 

“This is our first general meet- 
ing of the year and will be con- 
ducted on a no-record basis. We 
have a new member, Mr. Sam 
Asabian, but my reminder to put

doodlings into the security 
wastebasket on leaving this room 
is not directed to him as much as 
to his absent-minded elders in 
terms of service. Sam, will you do 
me the favor of making certain I 
carry away nothing?” A man with 
a bronzed moon face nodded and 
Jain bowed to Craddock. 

The general stood, slouching a 
little, and said, “I’m Marcus Hol- 
loman and Bill Quintard is with 
me. I am engaged to offer no 
source for the information be- 
hind the question I’d like you to 
consider. It should be regarded as 
a preliminary inquiry into a 
totally speculative condition. 
We are after guidelines and no 
reasonable guesses will be re- 
fused. An analogous situation 
might be that of a group gathered 
to consider the implications of 
flight before the Wright brothers 
got into the bicycle business. 

“We are aware that our 
fundamental premises may be in 
error. We appreciate the impos- 
sibility of detailed forecasts. I 
can’t enlarge on the background, 
but I’m allowed to say some tenta- 
tive evidence exists. This is the 
question: what happens if it be- 
comes practical to travel to an in- 
finite number of alternate 
worlds?” 

T HE twelve men were in a loose 
semicircle. Their ears did not 
flap nor were they at rigid atten- 
tion, but Ravenshaw had a feeling 



that they saw more casually than a 
pride of Admirals would see on 
purpose; he would bet that every 
man could write a thousand words 
about Craddock by the end of his 
sixty-second speech. This was a re- 
doubtable group. 

The man who had been cupping 
his eyes dropped his hands. “Break 
out the Second Coming type,” he 
said in a bullfrog voice. “I’m 
Alonzo Johnson,” he added, “and 
I thank you for such a notion.” 

“Who’s coming? Aimee Semple 
McPherson? Buddah, Ogier the 
Dane, King Arthur?” asked a small 
man, his feet stretched out in front 
of him. He had a face like a wedge 
of putty with home-cured olives 
pressed in for eyes. 

“The Honorable Joseph 
Levering,” murmured Swafford 
Jain. 

“Exactly the point, Joe,” said a 
man with a classic Roman profile, 
worn by time. “If you have infi- 
nite worlds, presumably every- 
thing can, has, or will happen. 
Aimee Semple McPherson has 
returned from the dead again 
somewhere, and the Four-Square 
Gospel Church rules the world in 
righteousness. I’m Ed Master- 
son. What I want isn’t hard. Just 
give me a world where Shake- 
speare wrote Charlemagne or 
Boadicea or whatever title you 
like. Give me a world where the li- 
brary at Alexandria was pre- 
served so I can read Euripides’ 
Andromeda and give me a world

where the Bishop of Yucatan was 
a scholar instead of a fanatic.” 
“What did Keats write at sixty?” 
asked a bald stocky man. “I’m 
Brander Lugard. What are the 
limiting factors, sir?” 

“Unknown, Mr. Lugard,” said 
the general. 

“Then anything is possible, inva- 
sion from Mars, peace declared, 
the Greeks stop biting themselves 
in the small of the back and devel- 
op the scientific method.” 

“Why not?” said a big man with 
stooped shoulders. “And Count 
Dracula has just put electric 
lights in his Transylvanian castle, 
sure he has. The whole thing’s too 
open for meaningful discussion. 
Walt Milias.” He nodded to Crad- 
dock and Ravenshaw. 

“Not so. I’m Cyrus Pfister. The 
same laws would apply — forget a 
chlorine world — and any real 
world has to be self-consistent. If 
you want intelligent animals, 
you’ve got to give up steak or eat 
your friendly neighborhood cow. 
There is an irreducible rationale 
in human affairs because of the 
inbuilt nature of the creature. 
That’s your limiting factor. If 
intelligence is not human it’s a dif- 
ferent ball game.” 

“You’re saying that a world 
must be psychologically viable? 
Then there’s no world of reason, if 
you rule out fantasy.” 

“Who needs one hundred per- 
cent reason? Panic saves, just like 
Jesus.” 



“You’re talking about un- 
knowns, not irreconcilables — ” 

“ — mystique about cold steel 
until some pragmatist with a Colt 
forty-five blows out the cobwebs 
the swordsmen use for brains — ” 

“ — another Mesabi to work 
over — ” 

“ — you can’t move a society by 
example. What influence do the 
Swiss have on the world except the 
gnomes who drill holes in the mon- 
ey structure and cheese — ” 

“ — buffalo management and 
herds of native meat — ” 

“ — but even knowing it can be 
done is vital. Look at the four-min- 
ute mile. As soon as one man did it, 
so could a dozen — ” 

“ — existence is all the proof logic 
requires — ” 

The discussion became general 
and Ravenshaw was content to 
look and listen. Sam Asabian was 
puzzled by his peers as they sup- 
ported preposterous structures 
and toppled them with snorts of 
laughter. The men were alert and 
mischievous as a cageful of mon- 
keys, some solemn, some jocular. 
Milias was pompous with a twinkle 
in his eye, a happy target who 
would sit on a pigmy with ele- 
phantine grace whenever he could 
lure one close enough. The hottest 
argument was not heated. Asa- 
bian’s face cleared as he under- 
stood this was for fun, deadly earn- 
est and candy-castle spinning all 
at once. Ravenshaw wondered 
what firm base of values made the 



32 



IF 




bedplate on which these men could 
bounce ideas like ball bearings. 

In a lull, Alonzo Johnson asked, 
“Mr. Holloman, what is your 
point of view? What do you want? 
Where do you stand?" 

“Good of mankind," said the 
general promptly. “Good of the 
United States. Good for you and 
good for me." 

“Open-ended enough," said 
Brander yLugard. “What I’d like to 
see is a world with no World War I. 
That was a generation cut short of 
brilliant fruition — a truncated 
generation." 

“So is every generation sir, not 
only that illuminated by star shells 
and the crepitating light of Vic- 
torian putrescence — " 

“ — show me a people whose goal 
is not sloth, indulgence and self- 
gratification — " 

“Contentment is the seed of 
destruction." Asabian threw that 
into the pot and settled back with a 
contented smile as two of the old 
wolves began to growl at it. 

With the discussion fragmented 
again, Ravenshaw found Swaf- 
ford Jain’s sardonic eyes on him. 
“Well, Mr. Quintard, what do you 
think of Our tank? We shock a 
good many people." 

Ravenshaw was off guard. “I 
suspect you’ll resolve the ques- 
tion and touch reality like a cus- 
tard pie spilled on the floor." 

“Or a bowl of applesauce?" said 
Jain softly. “Gentlemen, it’s time 
for refreshments." 



R AVENSHAW was relieved to 
get away from the Cassandra 
think-tank. General* Craddock sat 
at his side, bemused behind a pair 
of dark glasses by the exotic 
youngsters hitchhiking along 
University Avenue. He mar- 
veled at the “heshes" but when he 
saw one couple dressed in Eliz- 
abethan costume holding a card- 
board sign reading “Sack- 
amenna" he evidently decided it 
would be all downhill from there 
and asked, “Do you want lunch?" 
“After that a la cart? No, sir." 

A security man had driven in a 
battery-powered tea cart and plug- 
ged it into a wall socket. It was the 
size of a hospital bed and had fea- 
tured three general sections. 
Coffee, tea with cozies over the 
pots had occupied one end. The 
center had been taken up by a buf- 
fet of doughnuts and pastries, 
cold cuts and sun-cured olives and 
pickles and San Francisco sour- 
dough. The other end had held a 
brave display of ice, bottles and 
bar tools. 

“If we turn right," said the gen- 
eral, “isn’t there a bridge at Rich- 
mond? Then we can cut back over 
the Golden Gate and on to the air- 
port." Ravenshaw nodded. “My 
feelings are mixed," said the gen- 
eral. “I was throwing rocks ahead 
on that foggy trail and a couple of 
times I didn’t hear them hit. Who 
spilled the drink on your coat and 
sent it out to be sponged off?" 
“Rameses Three, the spry old

was browsing the atlas.” 

“Austin Mummery,” said Crad- 
dock, and fell silent. 

Mummery had approached 
Ravenshaw and said, “Come with 
me, Mr. Quintard. I’m a leading 
local spiritualist.” He had led 
Ravenshaw to the cart and ex- 
pertly popped a split of cham- 
pagne, pouring two tall glasses 
half full. He had topped them off 
with a bottle of Guiness and said, 
“Cheers. What do you think of our 
little group?” 

“A pleasure,” * Ravenshaw had 
said. He had looked admiringly at 
the cart. “How do you get into this 
club?” 

“It’s a little tricky. You’ve got to 
be right.” Austin Mummery’s 
eyes were black and his upper lids 
drooped a little. 

“I have another question,” 
Ravenshaw had said. Hooded 
eyes — that was the technical term. 
“How did you pick the name?” 

“Cassandra? She was right, you 
know, but nobody believed her. 
She was the daughter of Hecuba 
and Priam and she was cursed by 
Apollo. I’ve not been able to sat- 
isfy myself whether the curse was 
knowing the future or the char- 
acter flaw of telling other people 
about it.” 

“I don’t know how inquisitive 
I’m allowed to be,” Ravenshaw 
had said, “but has Cassandra dug 
any bomb shelters?” 

“No. Whether the consensus 



derives from hope, rationality or 
futility, I cannot say.” Mum- 
mery had smiled. “Those who en- 
deavor to pin our butterfly beauty 
to statistical charts give us about 
ninety percent, which is a long way 
from being right all the time.” 

“You speak of consensus — ” 
“The powerful force behind 
democracy. Forget ephemeral 
intellectual fashions and forget 
the committee that built a camel 
instead af a horse. The fuel for 
Cassandra is accord.” 

“Agreement on what, sir? Your 
approach seems—” 

“Frivolous?” Even Mummery’s 
lips were seamed and the terrain of 
wrinkles changed when he smiled. 
“We were solemn once, until we 
found we were friends and party 
people. We only suspected this on 
the outside because we felt obli- 
gated to wear a mask of sobriety 
in front of the peasants.” He was a 
provocative old scoundrel. “This 
is Liberty Hall, Mr. Quintard, 
and we do as we damn well please.” 
“And the price of liberty?” 

“We have no formal philoso- 
pher to keep us vigilant with Ps 
and Qs.” 

“So what is' your base phil- 
osophy?” Ravenshaw was certain 
that Mummery examined arid ig- 
nored the word “base” in a milli- 
second. He had to be over seventy, 
but he wq$ a man like an antique 
beartrap, old and powerful, with 
steel teeth in the jaws. 

“We all want to be heroes,” 



34 



IF 




Mummery had answered. “Carlyle 
pointed out, ‘It is the property of 
the hero in every time, in every 
place, in every situation, that he 
comes back to reality; that he 
stands on things and not the show 
of things/ ” 

Ravenshaw had shuddered. Grue 
is a thin ice that floats in Scot- 
land — he had felt as if someone 
had scooped up grue and dropped it 
down his back. Only serious men 
can afford comedy, buffoons 
crack jokes. Remembering Mum- 
mery’s eyes, Ravenshaw shivered 
again. 

G eneral craddock 

looked over at Golden Gate 
Fields from the overpass as they 
left U.S. 80 for State 17. “A 
Chinaman said he was already 
convinced that one horse could 
run faster than another. Do you 
bet races, Arleigh? Who’s fast 
horse?” 

“Could be a dead heat. Jain and 
Mummery. What control do they 
have on Cassandra?” 

“I don’t know,” said Craddock. 
“It’s a pretty plush setup. Each 
man has an office; they pay them- 
selves about twenty-five thousand 
and the club picks up the tab for 
common expenses. Let me see. 
Those people in the front of- 
fice-smarter than average 
guards — manager — overhead — ” 
He brooded as they zagged and 
zigged through Richmond to the 
hill suffused with hydrogen sul- 



phide from the refinery and drifted 
down to the toll plaza of the bridge. 
They were on the whaleback with 
a spectacular view in all direc- 
tions when Craddock said “Yup. 
Maybe so. Well, well. When I get 
back to Washington I’ll put a lit- 
tle heat under this pot and see if it 
percolates.” 

Ravenshaw winced. “What 
about their conclusion?” 

“‘We recommend the positive 
action of doing nothing/” the 
general quoted. “Well, that’s the 
course we’ve been following. I am 
the king of an island and I own one 
boat. I keep that boat busy fishing 
and I’m scared to let it explore. 
It has been caught in storms 
and blown away to strange coasts 
a couple of times, but so far it’s 
come back home. One boat and 
there aren’t any more.’’ He 
glanced at San Quentin to the left 
and sighed. “How is the fishing go- 
ing, Arleigh?” 

“Got a sad rascal on a bare hook 
the other day,” said Ravenshaw. 
“Maybe he thought I was a book- 
ing agent. He opened his cooler 
and took out a Manhattan in a 
plastic container with a lid. It had 
a slice of orange and a maraschino 
cherry in it. He drank the dfink. 
He put the cherry, stem and all in 
his mouth. He took it out with the 
stem tied into an overhand knot. 
He went through the same routine 
with another Manhattan and spat 
out a square knot. He said he was 
retired Navy and he was going to 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD 



35 




work on it until he could tie a bow- 
line with his tongue, but all the 
drinks were expensive. I sug- 
gested putting the cherry in a glass 
of beer and he walked out mad." 

The general had a pained ex- 
pression. 

While he drove around the hill 
and snaked over to 101 south, 
Ravenshaw told about the man 
with the pickling method for rust- 
clad steel. It seemed the material 
took a while to oxidize and 
dripped rust on the passersby. 
Then there was a real estate broker 
with -an in-tank fuel pump, and the 
postman who had built an elec- 
trostatic dry-wash machine for 
flour gold in the desert. As they 
drove past Mill Valley* Raven- 
shaw pointed out it was still a 
materials handling process even 
though the mill was supposed to 
have a ninety-four percent re- 
covery capacity. 

“Anyone following us?" asked 
Craddock. 

“No, sir. I’ve been checking." 

“How about that chemical ore- 
reduction process?" 

“It’s another thing I don’t 
understand very well. I once had a 
fair background in chemistry and 
physics, but not any more. Maybe 
we ought to have a smart young 
man in the office instead of me. 
I’ve been away too long." 

“I wouldn’t say that. WBY has 
been a surprisingly successful 
♦vendor of R & D. Others want in." 

“The word gets around," said 



Ravenshaw. “We’re getting a 
caseload of technical hotshots. 
We see anybody who walks in the 
door, and the last time I checked, 
we hit one out of fourteen. A year 
ago it was one out of thirty-three. 
We’re getting people from all 
over, not just locally." 

“Our primary mission is still in- 
explicable phenomena," said the 
general. “How come you weren’t 
tempted by that offer from Lyne 
Jolley, about twice what you make 
as a lieutenant colonel." 

“I guess I like fishing." 

“How about Nell Rowley?" 

“Delightful," said Ravenshaw. 
The freeway ran through the hills 
above Sausalito. It was compara- 
tively old and had the faults of 
youth. It leaped canyons on bal- 
anced fills from eucalyptus-sloped 
cuts. The leaves reflected the cold 
afternoon sun, thin gold and 
green. “But with that lady, you’ve 
got to learn to bob and weave." 

They ran downhill to the Golden 
Gate Bridge. 

“I wonder if you can have 
crooked wise men?" mused the 
general. “I’m going to bob and 
weave with those boys. How do you 
buy wise men? They’ve got every- 
thing they want. Knaves don’t bat 
eight-eighty. What is their price, do 
you suppose?"

the ups and downs of exuberance 
and depression. He didn't like to 
wallow in the troughs or be blown 
by the high winds of exhilaration. 
A side effect of this position was 
detachment, and he had no shame 
about leaving his opinions sus- 
pended in the air, like Moham- 
med’s iron coffin. 

He filed the Cassandra affair in 
the back of his head and went 
about his business as chief of 
WBY. It was a refreshing period 
of quiet work and modest pleas- 
ure, when problems were chal- 
lenging and solutions appeared 
with gratifying regularity. 

Jethro Wellaby had made a hat 
with a propeller on it. “Swamp 
cooler,” he said. “Sweat evapo- 
rates. Cool in shade.” The electric 
motor was powered by selenium 
cells mounted on the brim of a 
solar topi. Ravenshaw took it to 
the window to catch the sun and 
the propeller picked up speed and 
sounded like a wasp. “Next model 
inside hat,” said Wellaby. “Prob- 
lem, not enough power for bigger 
fan.” 

Ravenshaw asked about more 
cells on the side of the topi, a four- 
bladed propeller and an inner 
shell to conceal the machinery 
without clipping ears. Wellaby 
said he had grape pickers in mind 
and had to hawkeye expense. 
Ravenshaw said it looked more 
like a luxury item and maybe the 
thing to do was encase the fan in a 
glittering expanded metal cage 



on top* It would be a novelty and 
status symbol for fishermen and 
golfers and Abercrombie & 
Fitch. Wellaby said be liked 
grapes. Ravenshaw said he would 
like to see Mark II and Wellaby 
said thank you and stumped out of 
the office. 

Nell Rowley opened the door 
and asked what Beany wanted and 
Ravenshaw told her he had read 
about such a gadget years before, 
but had never seen one in action. 
“So it’s been a variegated day,” he 
said. “Miss Moffet and Leggitt in 
the morning, and artificial sun- 
light and Beany in the afternoon.” 

“You have a man named Tim- 
berline Binghorst at four,” she 
said. “He’s from someplace in 
Utah and wants your advice.” 

“Did you ever see a cat like 
that?” said Ravenshaw. Nell said 
Miss Moffet had to be out of her 
head to put a cat on her stomach to 
cure indigestion, no matter what 
she believed about sympathetic 
vibrations. Ravenshaw said it was 
not just any cat, but a cat from this 
particular quaint old English 
village. 

Nell asked what he was going to 
do about Leggitt, the polywater 
man who had followed Miss 
Moffet, and Ravenshaw said he 
had phoned the Advanced Re- 
search Projects Agency at the Pen- 
tagon and they were going to have 
Dr. Hugo Trumble fly down from 
Seattle for a look-see. They 
doubted that any druggist could

37 




come up with a catalyst for poly- 
water, orthowater or anomalous 
water. Ravenshaw didn’t know 
anything about the polymer 
waters except they boiled high, 
froze low and turned into a funny 
kind of ice. 

Their eyes met and Ravenshaw 
kept a carefully straight face. Nell 
said composedly that she would 
get out the rest of the letters. 

Ravenshaw stood at the window 
and watched a cruiser driving 
down San Diego bay, headed for 
Point Loma and the open sea. He 
did not admire the Navy, but for a 
moment he wished he were leaning 
on a rail watching San Diego drop 
down the curve of the world, away 
from the question of Nell Rowley. 
Oh well, he thought,~~the Navy 
served a purpose. If it didn’t exist, 
the Army would have to invent it. 

Nell Rowley now, she boiled low 
and froze high and turned into a 
very funny kind of ice. 

She had been his secretary for 
eighteen months and together 
they had found a black box that de- 
livered air from 5000 feet up or 
water from 5000 feet down. They 
had encountered a robot watch- 
man redesigning common house- 
hold appliances to standards of 
its own technology. Most recently 
they had scrambled through the 
infinite worlds together. Some- 
times, at night, Ravenshaw 
awoke, taut with alarm, and turned 
on the radio and a pot of coffee to 
reassure himself he was a lieu- 



tenant colonel in the U.S. Army on. 
special duty and was safe in his 
own apartment in his own world. 

H E COULD not decide if Nell 
attracted the lightning bolts or 
if the endeavor was mutual. Pre- 
sumably she was a Mier, a mem- 
ber of a family or tribe or race 
from an alternate world, but her 
memory had been blanked out as a 
child and Ravenshaw lived in 
anticipation of the day it would re- 
turn. 

“Nameless dread,’’ he said 
wryly. 

Nell tapped on the door and an- 
nounced Mr. Timberline Bing- 
horst. 

Binghorst walked into the room, 
said, “Heh, heh — ’’ and blushed. 
He wore store clothes, a hairy 
double-breasted blue suit, prob- 
ably purchased for an occasion 
thirty years before. His shirt was 
pale yellow and his fruitbowl tie 
had slipped off center. He said, 
“Heh, heh — ’’ again and Raven- 
shaw asked him to sit down. 

“I won’t take much of your 
time,!’ Binghorst began in a voice 
likje rocks rolling down a distant 
canyon. “Heh, heh.’’ He cleared 
his throat and started again. “I 
read about you in the San Diego 
Union because I have a friend who 
works in the maifroom and Ben 
Knell thinks the Union has a bet- 
ter flavor than most, so sometimes 
when we’re snuggled around the 
Ashley with the snow hip-high

outside and we’re tired of 
Clarence E. Mulford— ” He ran 
out of breath and panted, his 
brown eyes beseeching Raven- 
shaw for patience. He took a deep 
breath and started again like a man 
running uphill. 

“It’s just that we live at Red 
Warrior in the Pine Valley Moun- 
tains in Washington County Utah 
not awfully far from St. George 
but the road is pretty rough even 
with the ’dozer work I had done 
last spring because it was a high- 
water year and made the Narrows 
so infernally rough I hung up on 
the gearcase — and almost busted 
the housing — and after that — I 
said to myself — ” He was dis- 
tressed that he had to stop to 
breathe again. 

“1 have a house in St. George," 
said Ravenshaw kindly, “just off 
Tabernacle on Third West. I in- 
herited it when my wife died. It's a 
yellow waterstone built in the 
nineties." 

“You LDS? asked Binghorst. 

“My wife’s father and uncle 
were Mormon — Zadok and Syl- 
vanius Sandler — ’’ 

“Syl and Zad, old, old friends! 
Dead now. My, but this is nice, Mr. 
Ravenshaw. Oh, but that Syl was 
comical! He said there were four 
liars in Washington County and I 
was one and Zad was the other 
three!" The old man laughed joy- 
ously. “Once Zad returned from 
Cedar City and said the people 
there mistook him for Syl and Syl 



said quick as a wink, Tm just as 
ashamed of it as you are!”’ Bing- 
horst choked with joy and Raven- 
shaw grinned in sympathy. 

“Oh, that Sylvanius Sandler! He 
was laid up on his death bed and 
somebody remarked he couldn’t 
get around as well as he used to. 
Know what Syl said? He said, ‘If 
my fool body could keep up with 
the dictates of my head, I could 
still get over this country better’ n 
a mountain goat.’ Indeed I do, I 
miss them both. So you knew the 
Sandler boys! Married Zad’s girl, 
didn’t you? Big eyes, bundle of 
springs, whip bright?’’ 

Ravenshaw nodded. 

“How this takes me back. 
Sylvanius, he was a comical fel- 
low. Oh, years ago, he took some 
grain to Stanley Mossis to have it 
ground to flour. Syl became 
impatient and said, ‘Damn it, Stan- 
ley, you grind so slow that I could 
eat that flour as fast as you grind 
it.’ Stanley wanted to know, ‘For 
how long?’ And Syl, he said, ‘Until 
I starved to death!”’ The old man 
laughed until he had to wipe his 
eyes with a blue bandana. “Ah, 
Mr. Ravenshaw, it’s a great 
pleasure to meet home people in a 
big city like San Diego.’’ 

“How can I help you here, Mr. 
Binghorst?’’ 

ELL, sir, I do have some- 
- ▼ ▼ thing on my mind besides 
reminiscences." The old man blew 
his nose on the bandana. He ex-

plained he had been clearing out an 
abandoned stope and had come 
across an old trunk Zadok Sandler 
had stored there when he had left 
the country for California. It was 
filled with oddments of no par- 
ticular value, but it also contained 
Zadok’s journals. Binghorst 
leaned forward, his hands on his 
knees. 

“You see, that’s the entire point. 
Ben Knell and me’s the only ones 
left at Red Warrior. The road’s 
twenty-seven miserable miles to 
St. George and in the winter 
there’s not much to do, so I sup- 
pose we read over the journals two- 
three times. There’s something 
naggy , something I can’t quite see, 
and I am troubled in myjnind. Ben 
Knell would be rolling cigarettes 
on his machine out of the San 
Diego Union and we’d both be puz- 
zling away — and I still don’t know 
what the matter is.” 

“What sort of man was Cay’s 
father?” 

“Quiet, quirky, fifteen years 
younger than Syl. Oh, for instance, 
he speculated on the names of 
things. He wanted to hire a phar- 
maceutical house to manufac- 
ture liquid hair soap so he could 
make a label that said REAL 
POO. Things like that. Little secret 
jokes, like the summer of ’forty- 
one when he bought a pound of 
columbine seed wholesale. 
McKana’s Improved, I think the 
name was. Went into the Sierras 
after tungsten and sprinkled the 



seed all up and down Mono Creek 
and the Recesses where colum- 
bines grow. Said the native flower 
was pale gold and all the reds and 
purples and pinks ought to pop 
peoples eyes. He found scheelite 
so far back and high up nobody 
could get at it. 

“Another thing Zad did was 
paint apples. Down in Santa Clara 
they grow very sprightly apples. He 
stirred up some whitewash and 
painted punkin faces on Romes 
and twenty-ounce and Wolf Rivers 
over at the top end of Mother Jep- 
person’s place when the fruit was a 
month from harvest. Just before 
picking time, he went in and wiped 
off the whitewash — and left the 
pale jack o’ lantern face on the red 
skins. Caused a stir- Never knew 
who did it until I read his journal.” 

“What would you like me to do, 
Mr. Binghorst?” 

“Well sir, I’m not a poor man. 
Even at thirty-five dollars an 
ounce, Ben Knell and me shoot just 
twice a year. Then we high-grade 
and concentrate and go over to 
Denver to the mint. Me and my 
partner bought the discovery 
mine when all the smart fellas 
quit.’’ Binghorst stuck out his 
tongue and raised his eyebrows in 
mock surprise. “Don’t really need 
to shoot twice, but it makes a 
change. So I can indulge myself.” 
He took a record book out of his 
coat pocket. It was five by six and 
half an inch thick. “I’d like you to 
read it, Mr. Ravenshaw. This is 



40 



IF 




the last one, nineteen-forty to 
nineteen-forty-one. What will it 
cost?” 

“Nothing. It might take a 
while.” 

“No-no, whatever’ s right. I am 
not easy in my mind.” 

“How do I get in touch with 
you?” 

“Qh, Sylvanius! I do miss him.” 
The old man's voice was gentle and 
his smile was very sweet. “Some- 
body asked Syl how the weather 
was on Pine Mountain and he said, 
‘We have nine months of hard 
winter and three months of damn- 
late-in-the-fall.’ It snowed after we 
got out and we can't get in a while. 
Just write to St. George.” 

N ELL ROWLEY was drowsing 
in the back seat of the 210 
Cessna. She had folded her wind- 
breaker for a pillow and wore a 
plaid wool shirt that would drive a 
Scotchman to drink. Ravenshaw 
looked through the window and 
marveled that the pioneers ever 
reached the Pacific. This section 
of desert was desolate and 
deserted as it had been a hundred 
years before. The sun flooded the 
cabin as they flew east at 9000 feet 
at nine on a Saturday morning. 
The pilot chewed gum, watched the 
instruments and the sky, listened 
to his earphones and occasion- 
ally adjusted the trim. He was a 
fine, narrow-minded young man, 
interested only in flying. Ravem 
shaw approved of him, however 



dubious he might be about the trip. 

General Craddock woke him at 
six with a report on Cassandra 
Investments. Alonzo Johnson 
owned a string of newspapers in 
Nebraska and the Dakotas. 
Brander Lugard had been chief of 
the Charleston Port Authority. 
Cyrus Pfister had built a medical 
supply house into a mini-con- 
glomerate that dominated certain 
phases of the industry. 

“How about Jain?” said 
Ravenshaw. 

“Georgia Christian College, 
Rochester Institute of Tech- 
nology, University of Chicago. 
That’s a mixed bag. A commodity 
speculator, presidential economic 
advisor. World Bank expert. A 
very sharp and shifty sort of man.” 

Asabian was a highway 
contractor, Milias was railroads. 
DeWitt, Masterson and Roeh- 
lich, O’Conner, Taddonio and 
Levering, all were low-profile suc- 
cess stories. They were models of 
financial acumen, but in some as- 
pects, slippery as greased pigs. 
Jain had once kept a mistress in all 
the Bowash cities and, when threat- 
ened by a blackmailer, had said, 
“Publish and be damned.” The 
invulnerability each man made 
for himself seemed to be a com- 
mon factor. 

“Mummery is a wild westerner, 
old school. He was up and down in 
sheep and cattle and minerals until 
the war made him sell. He par- 
layed that money into a fortune

when the Salt Lake exchange went 
wild with uranium in the early 
’fifties. He’s into primary re- 
sources now, and holds things to- 
gether with an agrochemical 
company in Stockton.” 

Ravenshaw asked if Cassandra 
had cooked the books and Crad- 
dock replied if they had, they were 
smarter than the IRS men he had 
combing them. He asked what was 
new with WBY. Ravenshaw told 
him about the man growing 
Holland cucumbers in an old 
citrus packing shed under red and 
blue lights. Ravenshaw had told 
the grower that incandescents 
gave off the same colors and the 
system was not patentable. The 
man accused him ~ of floc- 
cinaucinihilipilification and he con- 
descended to explain it was the ac- 
tion or habit of estimating as 
worthless. 

“So maybe I’m overreacting to 
the charge. I’m going on a wild 
hare chase in a couple of hours. I 
made a deal with Fabio Marquien 
for his plane and a pilot. I’m vic- 
tim of my expressed opinion that I 
should be Johnny at the rathole.” 

H E HAD taken Nell to dinner 
at an Italian restaurant and 
told her about Binghorst. She 
asked to see the journal while they 
were waiting for the pizza. Raven- 
shaw studied the Lombardy pop- 
lars on the wall, and the sheep and 
shepherdess with a rougish twinkle 
in her eyes, while Nell looked 



through the old record book. She 
read by the light of a candle stuck 
in a wax-encrusted bottle. Her pal- 
omino hair was in disarray and her 
jumper, if he had the term right, 
was just as handsome a weave as 
Binghorst’s suit. Her eyebrows 
were mahogany brown and smooth 
and her lashes cast shadows on her 
cheeks. She looked up and Raven- 
shaw’s heart stopped beating. 

“Listen to this,” she said. “May 
fifth, nineteen-forty. Germany in- 
vades Holland, Belgium and Lux- 
emburg. The cold war is hot. I have 
no faith in Gamelin or Weygand. 
Cay asked why I was so excited by 
a war five thousand miles away. 
Must get new battery for all- wave 
Zenith. Mucked out today. Drill 
tomorrow.” 

How could he ever have thought 
her voice high when it was silky 
velvet? Pitched above middle reg- 
ister, it had a sheen like sun 
through a bottle of clover honey. 

“September twenty-two, nine- 
teen-forty. Kraut-Wop-Jap pact. 
Should not familiarize the enemy. 
Now it’s sure we won’t keep out of 
the war. School people agree Cay 
can stay at Red Warrior as long as 
Betty will teach. They supply 
books. Betty was onstage when 
Melchior watched the swan boat 
pull out ahead of time. How odd to 
have an opera star at Red Warrior 
and teacher for Cay.” 

Her honey voice had lime in it, 
or lemon, or alum or quinine. 
Ravenshaw relaxed. A voice like 



42 



IF 




cough syrup, that’s what. 

“Are you listening?” She 
marked a page with a finger. She 
had violet eyes that ranged from 
soft lavander to purple. “Do you 
want to know what happened on 
December second? I’ll tell you 
what, Arleigh. Pearl Harbor.’’ 

“Sure. Zadok’s interests were 
Cay, the war and mining.’’ 

“December . second? Pearl 
Harbor?’’ 

“Uh-oh. I see what you mean.’’ 

“And I don’t think the Germans 
invaded Russia on June seven- 
teenth. If the error’s constant, he’s 
always five days off.” 

“That could be what puzzled 
Binghorst. Wait a minute— I 
know — Zadok had a nineteen- 
thirty-five calendar in nineteen 
forty. 

“Sure he did. And he used the. 
same calendar in nineteen-forty 
one.” 

“Nineteen-thirty-six would keep 
the five-day differential. Bing- 
horst said Zadok had a fey sense of 
humor. Quirky practical jokes a 
specialty of the house. This is a 
chuckle from beyond the grave, 
that sort of thing.” 

“Are you being intentionally 
obtuse? Sometimes you are. Just 
suppose you could see five days 
into the future.” 

“ ‘If you’re smart, why ain’t you 
rich?’ ” said Ravenshaw. 

“When her father died, was your 
wife poor?” 

“We were married a year later. 



Now look, Nell. The old man 
played the market. He went down 
to Fresno once a week and sat 
around at brokerage house. Cay 
got a fat wad of stocks and more 
money than anyone ever figured. 
But tell me this, if Zad could read 
the future, why should he piddle 
around with mines? I don’t believe 
it.” 

“Arleigh, are you rich?” 

“It runs to pie i la mode , if 
that’s what you want.” 

“Arleigh, why have you stayed 
in the Army?” 

“Just so I could meet you,” he 
said promptly. 

“You’re a devious man.” She 
leaned back. “An evasive scoun- 
drel.” 

Ravenshaw sighed heavily. 
“There used to be a popular philo- 
sophic ploy called free will versus 
predestination. It was just as 
much fun as counting angels on 
the point of a pin — ” 

“Arleigh—” 

“All right. I suppose we’d better 
look at the other journals. Thank 
God, here’s the pizza. I’m hun- 
gried to death.” 

G eneral craddock had 

listened to all this and said, 
“Give a man enough rope and he 
can tie it around his world and 
measure it.” 

“Isn’t there something about 
hanging himself?” 

“Then hang loose,” the general 
had said and hung up.

They were flying over Lake 
Mead now, the rock hills turned 
into peninsulas and the barren 
valleys into ragged coves by the 
startling blue water. The day was 
speckless. Boulder City was a 
sharp miniature in the crisp air. 

Ravenshaw studied the map and 
asked, “Could we cut over by Pine 
Valley Mountain?” 

The pilot said, “It’s a little up- 
hill. Ten-three, isn’t it?” Raven- 
shaw said he didn’t want to fly 
over, just parallel the range on the 
Pirte Valley side for a few minutes, 
then back and south to St. George. 
The pilot said, “No sweat.” 

The Virgin River gorge made 
Ravenshaw glance at the snug in- 
terior of the plane, but the instru- 
ment panel with the full avionic 
pack, the toggles, switches and 
dials did not reassure him when he 
looked down again at the chopped- 
up land. He was intricately pack- 
aged, but he was conscious of the 
^fragility of his protection. The 
amazing red sandstone country 
crawled lumpily below and built to 
the sweep of Pine Valley Moun- 
tain. While, the canyons were dun 
atid black with brush and ever- 
greens, every shelf and valley was 
white with snow. 

“Maybe we’ve had a nice 
outing,” he said to Nell. “Enjoy 
the scenery.” 

They banked and went downhill 
to St. George. The Temple was 
white and the cliffs were red, the 
cottonwoods and poplars were 

44 



leafless. The landing gear clunked 
and they set down at the airport. 
They taxied to the tie-down line 
and the pilot said he’d get gas and 
lunch and maybe a nap. 

A medium-sized helicopter with 
private markings was being 
fueled by a small tanker. Standing 
to one side was a lean figure in 
cavalry twill pants and coat. The 
man had a paisley scarf at the open 
neck of his shirt. 

He said, “Hello, Mr. Quin- 
tard,” and touched the brim of his 
dove-gray Stetson. Gray eyes in a 
gray, seamed face. Austin Mum- 
mery. 

IV 

L IKE most men, Ravenshaw 
had 20-20 hindsight. He could 
have said, “Nice to see you — ” 
and gone his way. When Mum- 
mery said he was going over to Red 
Warrior to check the cabin after 
last week’s blizzard, Ravenshaw 
might have said it was a fine day to 
fly up to Salt Lake City. 
Mummery said he had grubstaked 
Timberline Binghorst years before 
and they were partners in a mine. 
He had flown over from his ranch 
up Meadow Valley Wash from 
Glendale and why didn’t they come 
along to Red Warrior with him? 
The Vought Aloutte III cruised at 
1 17 mph and they might enjoy the, 
experience. 

So, like a cheerful idiot, Raven- 
shaw told his pilot they’d be back 

IF 




in a couple of hours and the pilot 
said if they were delayed, the 
Cessna flew well in the dark and he 
liked instrument flying. 

Mummery introduced them to 
Ned Vasu, his pilot, a Filipino 
whose parents had come to Wenat- 
chee before the war. He had 
learned to fly in the Army and had 
spent three years in Germany. He 
was a quiet man with an impas- 
sive face and obviously an expert. 
The Aloutte rolled ten feet and 
bounded into the air. The noise 
level was lower than Ravenshaw 
had expected and there were none 
of the windleaks he associated 
with helicopters. 

Flying a bird was the same as 
patting your head and rubbing 
your stomach. Mummery ex- 
plained. It took dexterity and tim- 
ing to handle the cyclic stick, the 
collective stick and the foot 
pedals all at once. “It’s expensive 
in time to learn,” he said, “and 
you’ve got to ration time. I’ll 
never be a lapidary because I 
can’t afford the patient hours. Op- 
tions close in as you get older.” 
Ravenshaw said, “Hadn’t we 
better turn north?” 

“We’ll run over to the ranch for 
lunch,” said Mummery. His 
hooded eyes were not smiling. 

“No way,” said Ravenshaw. 
“Turn this thing around. My time 
won’t wait for lunch.” 

“Nor for any man. Colonel 
Ravenshaw?” 

“Back to St. George.” Raven- 



shaw unlatched his seat belt. 

“Relax and enjoy, ” said 
Mummery. He had an old S&W 
revotver in his hand. “You are 
being kidnaped.” The gun had a 
bore like a sewer pipe. “Fasten 
your belt. No shenanigans or I'll 
plug your girl first.” 

Ravenshaw raised his voice. 
“Vasu! They jug accessories.” 

“Mr. Vasu came to me from Ft. 
Leavenworth on the intercession 
of a quite influential congress- 
man. Ned, is there anything criti- 
cal in that panel under the win- 
dow?” 

“Only insulation, sir.” * 

“Then don’t be surprised.” 
Mummery squeezed the trigger. 

The bullet grazed Nell’s knee. 
Ravenshaw surged against his belt 
and dropped back. His ears rang. 
The .38 was fastened on him. 
Mummery coughed. Nell was 
white, staring at the rip in her pants 
and the blood beginning to seep 
from the scratch. 

Mummery coughed again as the 
fumes sucked out. “That should 
establish my bona fides. Don’t de- 
lude yourself. I was curious 
enough after our first meeting to 
put men at the airports. Hollo- 
man lost himself at O’ Hare, but 
Quintard turned into Ravenshaw 
in San Diego — and he turned out to 
be a mysterious Army officer 
who was once married to Zadok 
Sandler’s daughter.” 

Nell patted the slow seep of 
blood with a handkerchief. Raven-

shaw turned his attention back to 
the mad old man. At the same time 
he went onto war status. Perhaps 
it showed, because Mummery’s 
big hand tightened on the pistol 
grip. 

“What do you have in mind?” 
asked Ravenshaw. 

“Friendly persuasion.” Air 
whistled through the hole in the 
panel. “Stuff your handkerchief 
in there, girl.’’ Nell did as she was 
told and the shrilling stopped. 
Mummery smiled and Raven- 
shaw noted that only his teeth and 
eyes were unwrinkled. “You are 
going to tell me about the alter- 
nate worlds and how to get there.’’ 
“You’ve flipped your wig.’’ 

“Lace your fingers behind your 
head, Ravenshaw. Don’t * fiddle 
with the belt. The life you save may 
not be your own. I don’t like waste, 
but there are lots of scrubby wom- 
en around.’’ 

N ELL was sniveling. Her hair 
straggled over her face; one 
shoulder and elbow were pulled in 
toward her body. She looked like a 
charwoman after a twelve-hour 
shift. She may have convinced 
Mummery, but Ravenshaw 
thought she was as frightened as a 
nest of hornets. 

“My colleagues at Cassandra 
are resigned to fate,’’ said Mum- 
mery in tones of sweet reason, 
“except for Jain — and I beat him 
to the punch. No question, the 
great achievement of the human 
brain is association, the assembly 



of disparate facts to a purpose. 
What good is bumbling, innocent 
Binghorst, or Sandler’s crazy 
journals mildewing in a stope. 
Good for bait. Before we land, 
we’ll radio your pilot and tell him 
to drop off your bags at McCar- 
ran in Las Vegas and to go on 
home.’’ 

The revolver cracked again. The 
cut on Nell’s knee was paralleled 
by another. Mummery coughed 
and his eyes watered. The pistol did 
not waver. “I'll tolerate no more 
tomfoolery,’’ he told Nell. “Next 
time I take off your kneecap.” 

“I duh-duh-didn’t mean any- 
thing,” she blubbered. 

“You’re raising hell with a good 
secretary,” said Ravenshaw. 

“You won’t be needing one — un- 
less you cooperate.” 

“A carrot (or the donkey — 
what’s in it for me?’’ 

“Surcease,” said the old man. 
“And if you can persuade me to it, 
something better. I have only the 
simplest inducements to offer: 
food, water and warmth. That 
ought to be enough.” He glanced 
through the window and back at 
Ravenshaw. “We’re over the Tule 
Desert now and we’ll land on the 
Meadow Valley side of Mormon 
Mountains. There’s an old line 
house by a spring. Remote, isn’t 
it?” 

There was no sign of a road, not 
even a game trail. Snow salted the 
tops of the ranges. Clouds were 
gathering to the north. It was 
lonesome lost country where in 



46 



IF 




summer a coyote would pack a 
canteen. Vasu was mumbling into 
the mike about St. George and Las 
Vegas and leaving gear at McCar- 
ran. 

Mummery said, “About a week 
ago Ned and I sawed off four-foot 
lengths of light rail — fifty 
pound — and fixed them in con- 
crete. Got some old logging chain 
and welded it to the tops of the 
posts, six inches off the ground. It’s 
twenty-foot chain and the spring is 
thirty feet away. Got some cuffs 
and tacked them on. One post on 
each side of the little creek. 
Nothing fancy. You can listen to 
the water until it freezes. When you 
want to talk with me. I’ll be in the 
cabin drinking coffee.” 

“What do you want?’’ said 
Ravenshaw. 

“Twenty or thirty or fifty 
years.” The old man was in dead 
earnest. “Is it a gate? A door? An 
entrypoint at Forrestal? Or is that 
a stinking red herring? I don’t ex- 
pect a fountain of youth. Maybe 
Jain had that in mind. There have 
got to be worlds where a man is not 
cut off in his prime. Too much to 
ask? I think not.” That answered 
General Craddock’s question 
about price. Mummery wanted 
something money couldn’t buy. 

The helicopter was descending. 
Ravenshaw caught a look at a 
crooked stream in the bottom of 
the valley. Beyond, on a low mesa, 
was a large house with outbuild- 
ings. Jn the clear air he could see a 



caterpillar tractor painted cat-yel- 
low by a corral. Dust swirled as 
they hovered a few feet above the 
ground. They landed — whup-whup, 
whup — the bird was quiet. Ned 
Vasu flicked switches. In a careful 
ritual dance, he stepped behind 
Mummery and opened the door, 
never blocking the pistol. 

Mummery ordered his guests to 
the ground. “Don’t make a break 
for it. I gave the hands a week off 
with pay. There’s nobody around 
for twenty miles minimum.” The 
air was sharp and smelled of snow 
and sagebrush. Nell winced as she 
stepped down. Mummery backed 
off and Vasu stood slightly to his 
rear. 

The Aloutte was across the creek 
from the old line shack and 
Ravenshaw got a good look at the 
posts and chains. The ground was 
sandy and had been cleared of 
brush. Thunder grumbled miles 
away. The little creek was rimed at 
the edges and the white trunks of 
the bare aspens made the land- 
scape even chillier. 

Vasu stepped behind Mummery 
and whipped an arm around his 
neck, seized his right wrist and bent 
it behind his back. The cabin door 
opened and Swafford Jain walked 
toward them, an incongruous 
figure in high-laced boots of 
another age, whipcord breeches 
and a cashmere sweater under an 
old duffle coat. He wore a sheathed 
hunting knife. He carried a pump 
shotgun as if he knew how to use* 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD

it. ‘‘Join your friends, Austin,” said 
Jain. 

Vasu had the .38. Mummery 
stumbled over to Ravenshaw and 
Neil, coughing and rubbing his 
wrist. 

"Two items to mull over in hell, 
Austin,” said Jain, swiveling his 
head like an owl. “Ned is tired of 
driving your chopper and the 
important figure in our little puz- 
zle is Holloman — General Bill 
Craddock in real life. You should 
7 not be taken in by appearances.” 
He pushed his fur cap back on his 
polished hair. ”1 can do without 
the three of you.” He raised his 
shotgun. The stakes were high. He 
was a pragmatic old man. 

Nell switched worlds., 

V 

A HURTLING body knocked 
Ravenshaw off his feet. A 
shotgun bellowed. He was in the 
middle of a melee and he got up 
with a broken branch in his hand. 
A man in mottled brown and red 
came at him and Ravenshaw broke 
the length of punky aspen on his 
head. The man went down. Over 
the grunts and blows and shouts of 
the donnybrook came a whooping, 
steamy whistle — whoo-woo, whoo - 
wow, A man in green spun him 
around and Ravenshaw mashed 
his nose sideways with the heel of 
' his hand. He caught a glimpse of 
Nell being dragged off before he 

48 



was blindsided and hit dirt. His 
fingers closed over the shotgun 
barrel. The stock was bent but 
solid. He swung it right and left 
with satisfying thunks and shoved 
the butt into the stomach of a man 
who staggered into Austin Mum- 
mery and knocked him over. The 
whistle sounded again. 

The fight stopped as suddenly as 
Ravenshaw got into it. Men in red 
and brown ran downhill to a pecu- 
liar vehicle with a fiat platform. It 
began to move with a stately 
achoof-achoof noise. Jain had been 
dragged aboard with Nell. Raven- 
shaw ran toward it and sprawled 
over a body. The platform picked 
up speed on eight big wheels, 
mashing the sagebrush, lurching 
and creaking at 10 mph. 

“My God, what’s happened?” 
Mummery clutched his arm. 
“Where did all those crazy Indians 
come from?” 

“Custer’s last words,” snapped 
Ravenshaw. The man who had 
tripped him was Ned Vasu, dead 
and already dusty with a shotgun 
blast in his chest. Mummery was 
babbling. The old n\an drew back 
in alarm when Ravenshaw pulled 
away, and did not follow him down 
the slope. No one followed. 

Ravenshaw jogged through the 
sagebrush, thinking about the 
revolving barrel at the funhouse 
in Santa Cruz. Once you slipped, 
there was no way to go but head 
over heels until you found your feet 
again. Nell Rowley had the pre- 



IF 




posterous ability to slip into the 
infinite worlds with as much ef- 
fort as falling through tissue paper 
hoops. He did not know how she 
did it, he only knew he had the 
nightmare sensation of being 
dropped into the middle of noon- 
time Istanbul with no trousers. A 
worse nightmare was being sepa- 
rated from Nell and marooned in 
an alternate world. 

A wide shallow river ran down 
the valley with flourishing cotton- 
woods on either side. The sage was 
tall) and the bunch grass thick. 
Aspen and low oak grew on the 
slopes. The leaves were just begin- 
ning to turn color and this country 
obviously had more rainfall than 
his own world. The mechanical 
platform disappeared behind a 
low hill and Ravenshaw dropped 
to a walk with a stitch in his side. 

Beyond the river was a rise to a 
bench, a low mesa with broken hills 
beyond. There were two long, enor- 
mous blurs on the bench, unlike 
anything he had ever seen before. 
A smaller blur squatted between 
the two. The sun was warm and the 
temperature in the seventies; there 
were no heat mirages and the air 
was crystal. The platform forded 
the river and struggled slowly up 
the slope on the other side. The 
passengers dismounted and pushed. 
He could see them clearly against 
the long reach of the northern blur. 

A shallow wash meandered to 
the river and he stopped into a 
clump of screwbeans and looked 



back. Austin Mummefy was walk- 
ing with some men in green. Even a 
half-mile away he looked chirlcy as 
a cricket. Ravenshaw waited until 
Mummery and his friends crossed 
the river and made their way up the 
rise. Ravenshaw went up to his chin 
in a channel near the far shore. 
There was no footpath and no 
road. He climbed the slope and 
crawled to the crest. 

T HE mesa had been leveled, but 
the ground was gullied to within 
a hundred yards of the blur. A 
concrete apron ran to the reach of 
his fuzzy vision. It was broken 
back here and there, in spite of a 
riprap and gravel base. He had a 
corner view of the enigma. It was 
rectangular and ran half a mile to 
the west and a full mile south. The 
middle blur was much smaller 
and oval in shape. He stood and 
followed the concrete apron 
south, to cut the tracks of the lum- 
bering steam vehicle. There were 
no friendly beer cans or gum 
wrappers. A low dune of rippled 
sand ran for two hundred yards 
along the blur, piled there by some 
subtlety of wind and configur- 
ation. He walked over a stretch of 
mud puddled halfway up the slop- 
ing concrete, curled and crazy- 
cracked since the last rain. 

The wall was sixty feet high and 
cast a shadow beyond the river by 
the time he crossed the tracks. The 
tracks ran near the end of the struc- 
ture and vanished into the blur. 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD

Ravenshaw examined the build- 
ing closely for the first time. He 
tossed a rock at it. The stone 
slowed and fell to the ground. He 
broke a switch and poked. It was 
the same as poking a pound of 
butter on a boulder. When he 
whipped the branch, the energy of 
its motion was soaked up before 
it reached the surface. He had seen 
this phenomenon once before in 
the protective clothing worn by a 
man who called himself a Drish- 
na. It was evidently a physical 
principle unexploited on his own 
world. 

Because he was unable to knock 
and there was no doorbell, he con- 
tinued around the structure. The 
south side was also featureless. 
He thought a strobe light might 
help and blinked, but he was not in 
any kind of synchronization. He 
reached the southwest corner and 
walked off the concrete for a bet- 
ter view. The terrain was ir- 
regular at a slightly lower level 
than the pad. If he crossed to the 
hills, he could at least see over the 
wall. They were a mile away but he 
get a look before dark. 

Ravenshaw found himself walk- 
ing in an area intricately inter- 
cut by vertical channels. Sparse 
brush and a few rocks dotted the 
top; the cuts in the hard white clay 
bottomed out at twenty to twenty- 
five feet. The sun set and a few 
pink clouds reflected from the wa- 
ter standing at the bottom of a lit- 
tle gorge. He scrambled down for 



a drink. His thirst satisfied, he 
continued along the narrow trench 
to an intersection with another and 
followed it upstream to meet a 
blank wall. He returned to the first 
channel, missed his way. It was al- 
most dark before he made it to the 
surface. A chilly wind had picked 
up, but he stood and thought that 
he had put in an outstandingly 
stupid day. Given a choice, he un- 
erringly picked the door that 
dropped a bucketful of slop on his 
head. 

He groped for a handful of rocks 
and pitched one at a darker patch. 
It rattled down the side of a cut. 
He broke a branch of brittle wood 
and had to cut the leathery bark 
with his knife. He tasted the cam- 
bium and it was bitter. He thought 
of long-rats, the freeze-dried long 
range patrol rations issued by 
the army in Vietnam. He wished 
he were there and poked ahead 
with his stick. 

Eleanor Farjeon said. The night 
will never stay I The night will still 
go by/ Though with a million 
stars/ You pin it to the 
sky . Ravenshaw thought this 
was a damn lie. It was the dark of 
the moon and the night had gone 
on for several weeks. He felt like a 
printed man in a maze puzzle for 
children: Little Arleigh wants to 
* get into the picture. Pick up your 
pencil and help little A rleigh. 

H E HAD just proven to him- 
self that he was standing on a 



50 



IF 




surface totally surrounded by 
moats. It was impossible. He 
tossed a pebble. He could touch 
the other side with his stick. He 
jumped in the dark and sprawled 
on another impossible tabletop. 
On legs rubbery from hunger, he 
followed a gray streak that led 
into a gorge. He could see the 
North Star and much good it had 
done him. He had been as 
directional as a hot Mexican jump- 
ing bean. The wind was cutting 
cold. The walls rose on either side. 

He stepped into ankel-deep mud 
and was too tired to swear. A little 
later his foot slipped and he sat 
down in water. He was not as tired 
as he thought. He got up vigor- 
ously and bumped like a bee in a 
bottle between the clay walls. He 
hit a dead end, swore and turned 
back, turned around and threw a 
rock at it. Clang . 

The bottom of the metal door 
was chin high. This particular cut 
in the clay was four feet wide, so he 
gouged steps in either wall with his 
knife and did the splits up to a bar 
in the middle of the door. The step 
caved away, the bar tilted and he 
fell to the muddy bottom. When 
he squirmed through on the next, 
try, the door closed on the small of 
his back, leaving his mug tangled 
with a short ladder inside and his 
wump dangling. 

He was in a dark tunnel. He 
could scrape his Fingers and whack 
his head at the same time. Pru- 
dence made him crawl along the 



rough bottom. When his knees 
gave out, he walked backward 
painfully, like a bear. It was bit- 
ter cold and when he kicked the end 
of the tunnel, he was surprised he 
did not shatter like a Dresden 
Figurine. He wanted to smile until 
he stood and hit his head against a 
metal rod. It was the rung of a 
Fixed ladder and he climbed itr 

It went straight up for eight 
miles and when he topped out, his 
muscles were trembling uncon- 
trollably. When the twitches were 
spasmodic, he found he was in a 
closet about Five by eight with a 
low ceiling of slats. The walls were 
made of large smooth rectangles. 
He groped around, nearly felj 
down the shaft and found a rec- 
tangle with fingerholds in it. A 
plug came out of the wall, letting in 
blessed light. He squeezed into the 
hole and found himself looking at 
cardboard boxes across a width of 
floor: Goodbody and Son, Cal- 
cutta, Arizona. Select, Choice, 
Tenderfresh Collard Greens. 

He closed the door through 
which he had squirmed. It was the 
middle case of a pallet load 
marked: Kohlrabi. Greens were 
piled three tiers high on either side. 
He walked to a cross aisle past case 
after case of Cardoon, Salsify, 
Florence Fennel and Spinach 
Dock, none of which interested 
him. Across the aisle were Broad 
Beans in Ham Gravy. He climbed 
twelve feet to the top pallet with 
only a glance at the blurred wall in 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD

the distance. The cartons were 
not cardboard, but honeycomb 
plastic, and opened by turning an 
inset circle at either end of the 
case. The cans were institutional 
size, square and also plastic. They 
opened with a finger ring. It was 
almost warm so close to the dim 
ribbon lights in the ceiling. He ate 
a quart of beans with his fingers. 
He was thirsty, but he stretched out 
on top of the cases. He kicked the 
can of beans over the edge. He 
blinked his eyes. He fell asleep. 

R AVENSHAW was perfectly 
willing to believe that other 
people had memorable dreams, 
but his own experience lay on 
what Nell Rowley once called “the 
shores of sleep.” He slept and his 
mind made figures of dreamdust 
in the hypnogogic state, the re- 
turn to wakefulness after sleep. 

His wife had black eyes and shin- 
ing black hair. Her face was tri- 
angular and she moved like a 
dancer. When she stopped, she 
stopped like a statue. She spoke in 
a grumbly lovely voice without 
punctuation. He learned to listen 
to the melody as much as the 
sense. She strutted when she 
walked, went willowy when she 
chose, danced as she pleased: lady, 
loose lady or gamin. She had died 
instantly of an embolism while 
throwing dishes ten years before. 

Cay Ravenshaw had been quick 
as sunlight through shadows, salt 
and sweet, with facets like a hand- 



ful of emeralds. He remembered 
her beside a bed of tall cannas, 
red and yellow in the Oklahoma 
sun, caught with the flowers in an 
afternoon stillness. He saw her 
slim white body like a white velvet 
otter in the warm, willow-scent- 
ed Nacimiento River on the val- 
ley side of the Hearst San Simeon 
estate. 

He was drowsily pleased with 
this true color representation. 
There had been other occasions 
when the topic was handled in off- 
purple hues to illustrate her 
chancy temper and blind demands 
for a better moon. There is a lady 
sweet and kind/ Was never face fo 
pleased my mind . 

He murmured the words aloud. 
The brilliant black hair snapped to 
palomino without a fadeout or 
any prqper transition. Almost 
awake, he was too wary to un- 
bridle his imagination. He opened 
his eyes. 

A woman was sitting crosslegged 
on top of Broad Beans and Ham 
Gravy, looking at him, statue still. 

“You are a horrible sight,” she 
observed, “muddy and. mazed 
and bean-bespattered.” 

Ravenshaw stifled a groan. “I 
hurt, too,” he said. 

“What’s to be done and weary- 
deary,” she grumbled. “I prowl for 
pleasure and this is the onus of 
conspiracy and no benefit from 
it. I set a turkel to scrubbling your 
beans and mess from another 
world, no doubt. Oh willow woe,” 



52 



IF 




she said, “is me.” Her eyes be- 
trayed her languishing speech. 
They snapped with excitement. 

“Excuse the expression,” said 
Ravenshaw, “But where am I?” 

“In twenty-three-Kah-eight-sev- 
en-two.” 

He waited and wondered if the 
sensation in his chest were fibril- 
lation. She was very much like his 
memory of Cay, vivid as the arc of 
an electric welder. She was also a 
little grimy. The smudge on her 
cheek and the dirt under her fin- 
gernails were misplayed notes in 
a symphony — oboe or contra- 
bassoon. 

“This is the One Generation 
New World and I am of that gen- 
eration. If of an equal age, you 
wear less well than we.” 

“What is a One Generation New 
World?” She looked to be in her 
early twenties. He ignored her 
grubby appearance and admired 
her straight-backed, crosslegged 
grace. 

“We were set as babes on a 
multiple world with the bent philo- 
sophic to perfection in secret-—” 
Ravenshaw groaned. “Will you 
start from the beginning?” 

She spoke slowly to a backward 
child, “A Floridian spirited to 
Cheyenne will be Cheyennese. A 
child of Texas grown in Boston 
will be cod-stiff and constant to its 
guidance. Or should the son of the 
King at Bonneville be childhood- 
ed at the court of Porfirio III, 
would he not on all counts but 



color be conformable to his up- 
bringing?” She rubbed her nose 
with her wrist. “Therefore in us, 
the folly of our fathers is extir- 
- pated. We are the men beyond 
man, the ideal realized, experi- 
ment perilous carried to glorious 
fruition.” 

“I’m thirsty,” said Ravenshaw, 
who had his doubts. He swung his 
legs around and hung over the edge 
of the cases on his stomach. “‘An 
ape’s an ape, a varlet’s a varlet, 
whether his clothes be green or 
scarlet,’” he said and climbed 
down to the floor. “Does this brave 
new world have a bath in it?” 

S HE dropped beside him, nimble 
as a boy. “You are besotted 
with dirt and ignorance, an im- 
mensely improvable subject for 
the huffinpuffin,” she said with a 
flash of white teeth. She wore a 
rust and gold garment, a close fit- 
ting jumpsuit with stretch materia) 
at the waist and shoulders. 

She turned down the canyon of 
boxes, around corners and to a 
narrow transparent door in a 
thick cross wall. When Raven- 
shaw hesitated, she. stepped into 
the cubicle herself. Dust sprang 
out in a cloud and was sucked 
through the floor. He would not 
easily forget her eyes squinneyed 
shut in her gamin face and the 
black sunburst of her hair. He 
found the huffinpuffin much like 
a sandstorm. The external mud 
fell into clay and sand com-

ponents, there was a smell of ozone 
and his hair stood out from his 
head. 

“Water solves thirst, too,” he 
said. “I feel scraped.” 

“Water is an emotional concept 
currently but in allowance of 
obligation and generosity as 
well, I have potables stashed.” 

She banged a vertical panel and 
a large door slid open, leading to 
another room piled high with 
boxes. They zigzagged through 
different sorts of vegetables, 
evidently more popular than 
those in the warehouse they had 
left. Ravenshaw stopped and 
quenched his thirst with a can of 
orange-colored tomatoes from a 
broken stack of boxes. She opened 
a can and ate a tomato, threw the 
rest away. 

A humped, rectangular machine 
hauling a caboose crawled down 
the aisle, scuffed up the spilled to- 
matoes, swallowed the can and left 
the floor clean and shining. She 
said turkels wopld eat anything, 
but tomatoes were too lumpy for 
her, just like the lake, and led him 
to a narrow room with dusty fork- 
lifts along a wall. The girl rum- 
maged in a cupboard behind 
spare parts and brought out two 
tall cans. A flattish tube emerged 
when he pulled the tab. It was di- 
vided into larger and smaller sec- 
tions and when he drank, alcohol 
and pineapple juice mingled in his 
mouth. She said she had hidden 
the drinks three years before when 



it became obvious that desirable 
items were in shorter supply. In a 
closed system there was no 
replacement. And she did miss 
swimming. 

Ravenshaw asked how it could 
be a closed system when he had 
seen men outside? She choked and 
spluttered. She jumped to the 
floor and ran down a corridor and 
through a room filled with bales of 
cloth, into another with pipes and 
plumbing fixtures racked in rows, 
and turned abruptly into an area 
piled at haphazard with boxes. 
She danced over, around, through 
and across them with sure feet. 
Ravenshaw followed until she 
brushed three stacked containers 
that poured out feathered, scarlet 
balls. The girl was gone by the time 
he blundered through them. So 
was his sense of direction. 



H E WANDERED through end- 
less rooms. There wlas no 
sound but his own footsteps in the 
whole enormous warehouse. The 
pattern of storage was random 
from his worm’s eye view and he 
felt like a bug walking over a blue- 
print. He stifled a feeling of panic 
when he thought of Nell Rowley 
and took the only sure direction 
open to him. When he founds stairs 
or ramps or a circular staircase, 
he went up. He stopped in a con- 
geries of rooms that held him in 
horrid fascination. He inter- 
preted them as roboticized nurs-

IF 




cries with mimic mothers grown 
dusty beside individual pens. 

One of the figures said, “You 
must take your nap, dear,” and ad- 
vanced toward him. 

He fled in panic. The air was 
motionless and the floors were 
spotless, but when mother moved 
silently toward him her figure 
was alive with dust. 

He ran across padded floors and 
infant toys into an artificial 
turfed gymnasium and lost the 
series when a corridor opened to 
an S-curved space with toys and 
games suitable for ten-year-olds. 
There was a row of booths against 
a wall and when he sat on a low 
bench at a table, a door closed and 
he was trapped. 

A panel opened and he was 
served a peanut butter sandwich 
and a glass of milk. His mouth was 
dry and the milk helped the peanut 
butter down. When he returned 
the plate and glass to the recess, 
the panel closed and the door 
opened. 

A voice said, “Good child.” 

He wondered if the children had 
dreamed of people behind walls, 
and decided that by ten they would 
be conditioned to accept taped 
voices. He tried anbther booth and 
was served the same menu. He was 
trapped again and ate the sand- 
wich but did not finish the milk. 
He thought milk was great for 
young cows. The door did not open 
when he returned the glass to the 
recess. He spilled it on the floor 



and a small turkel scrubbed up the 
mess. 

A voice said, “Finish your milk, 
dear — ” and he was served a full 
glass. He drank it and got out. 

A little later he was caught in a 
study carrel. The voice had him 
solve problems in geometry with 
a stylus on a ground glass desk. 
The notation was different from 
his own, but the voice was patient 
and the explanation simple 
enough. The drawings remained 
until he tapped the erase bar. 
When the lesson was over he esti- 
mated the warehouse was five 
stories high and figured a little. 
He ended up with forty-three mil- 
lion plus square feet in the build- 
ing. The Pentagon had six and a 
half million. He got out of the 
carrel and stayed out of similar 
traps. What if he had befcn stuck in 
a history class? He found a com- 
pass in a room stocked with sup- 
plies for simple physical experi- 
ments. He went east and down at 
every opportunity. He opened 
one more door and stepped out- 
side. 

He was in an enormous en- 
closed park, with hillocks and 
trees and grass and rocks. He could 
see a strange green surface 
through a screen of trees. There 
were cabanas and tents and tree 
houses. At least a hundred people 
were in view in almost a hundred 
different costumes. They were in 
their early twenties, though the va- 
riety of clothes and hairstyles gave 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD 



55 




the illusion of a much wider age 
range. A few were gathered 
around a youngster dyed bright 
pink who was reading from a 
manuscript. A woman dressed in 
ribbons caught at her neck and 
ankles was working at a crude 
loom. A man in a full spade beard 
and a red-lined cape was swinging 
in a swing with his eyes shut. The 
park was in hard use and the grass 
was badly scuffed. A mechanical 
gardener, a variety of the turkel, 
was planting marigolds in blos- 
som, followed by a girl who picked 
the flowers and tore them to 
shreds. 

It was a contented scene with lit- 
tle cohesion. A woman engaged 
with some sort of dice looked at 
Ravenshaw, shrugged and went 
back to her game. He walked two 
hundred feet to the screening 
trees and through them to the shore 
of a lake, where a large group was 
following the progress of a four- 
wheeled steam vehicle. It had a 
central steering bar and the girl in 
the jumpsuit was dancing around 
on the platform with a dozen 
others. The man at the tiller pulled 
a large lever and the thing whistled 
like a horsedrawn 1890 popcorn 
wagon. The girl threw her arms 
around his neck as a wheel hit a 
rock and turned to the lake. 
Achoof-achoof it waddled into 
the thick water. The passengers 
jumped and struggled ashore 
through stinking mud, algae and 
' weeds. There was an underwater 



explosion, an intense burp that 
bubbled the surface before it 
flung gollops of green-brown slime 
into the air. It was a spectacular 
and ridiculous performance that 
hypnotized Ravenshaw. He 
looked around just in time to see 
Austin Mummery swing a short 
baseball bat at his head. 



VI 

R avenshaw folded like a 

cardboard skeleton. 

He did not lose consciousness, 
but his thoughts went random. The 
old man doesn't pull his punches — 
with a length of sausage — tries to 
slam the ball into the centerfield 
stands — a very sincere effort — had 
to be a twenty-year-old sausage— 
a picnic in the park with friends— 
how nice . .-. 

He was heaved upright by a cou- 
ple of men on each arm. They 
marched him back into the build- 
ing. He tried to keep his head from 
hobbling as he pedaled an invisible 
bicycle through what could have 
been a foyer if it had featured 
potted palms, through administra- 
tive offices to a large bare room 
lined with dull blue cabinets stuffed 
with electronic gear. Rows of jewel 
lights blinked; machined metal 
spools turned behind panels and a 
low drone filled the dry electric air. 

The room lurched. Ravenshaw 
screwed his eyes shut. He sat down 
abruptly, as a chair hit the back of 



56 



IF 




his knees. His head lolled forward. 
He opened one eye to see an earn- 
est young man with the tip of his 
tongue caught between his teeth 
walking around and around him in 
a dizzying pattern, and Ravenshaw 
was trussed with a white rope like 
a fly for a spider’s dinner. 

Nausea surged and was gone. 
His eyes focused. Mummery was 
sitting in a cylinder of light. Ten 
feet away, Swafford Jain sat in an- 
other. They looked like two tom- 
cats full of canaries. 

“ — so cream rises to the top,” 
said Jain complacently. “Is your 
mechanical genius going to build 
another steam wagon?” 

“We have better equipment in 
storage and so do you,” said 
Mummery. “There’s a kind of fly- 
ing carpet I want to check out.” 
“What amazes me is the build- 
ing — the computer says the roof is 
laser-structured, absolutely dead 
flat — have you poked around in 
your library yet?” 

“Enough to begin the lake. So 
much to do, so little time — ” 
“Time? Have you looked at the 
medical section?” 

“Hah!” said Mummery and 
both old men smiled. “But I do 
wish you had dedicated yourself to 
scholarly pursuits. Do you sup- 
pose a mechanical background is 
essential to—” 

“Technical,” said Jain. “With- 
out a technical base you stand on 
an intellectual skateboard — until 
you move. I wish you’d been an 



absentee rancher and market ma- 
nipulator.” 

“Too bad,” said Mummery. He 
looked at Ravenshaw from his cyl- 
inder of light. “We’ll take them 
one at a time, of course.” 

“Certainly. If he wears out, we 
have the woman in reserve. We’ll 
find their method yet. Austin, I 
congratulate you on the idea. If 
this were Rome, I’d call you P.T. 
Barnum. Give ’em circuses.” 

Jain faded and the projection 
vanished in a twinkle of light. 
Mummery yawned as his own cyl- 
inder dimmed to the light level of 
the room. His eyes were hooded. 
Rameses Three brooded. 

Ravenshaw’s head throbbed in a 
slow drumbeat. He regretted his 
tendency to see the infinite worlds 
as dismal fantasies on the part of 
the natives. He could not over- 
come the idea that this was a fun- 
ny-money world. Funny-money, 
even though Ned Vasu had found 
death negotiable. He could even 
admire the old men for their cat- 
quickness to land on their feet. No 
energy wasted in recrimination. He 
had reservations about their situa- 
tional estimate, but, tied to the 
chair, all he could do was sit tight 
His grin was sour. 

It was somehow comical that he 
had found the wrong warehouse — 
he had had a choice of three struc- 
tures — after his search for Nell in 
the night and it was fairly humor- 
ous that Mummery had slugged 
him with a salami. It was less fun-

ny that this world's young inhabi- 
tants seemed to have fallen into 
line so easily with the suggestions 
of the two old men. Cream rises to 
the top . Granted that Jain and 
Mummery were charismatic char- 
acters, it was an accomplishment 
for them to have assumed author- 
ity here with such ease. He said as 
much to Mummery. 

“How about it?” 

“They are anarchists. They be- 
lieve that everyone should do what 
he wants to do. The idea of com- 
mon good is alien to them. They 
live in a vacuum of the present 
without historical perspective, so 
they have no judgment. Push the 
proper button and they drool like 

“Big deal, cleaning the lake. 
Why didn't they do it themselves?’’ 
“Change filter and flamer and 
flow patterns. I've been thinking 
about that. No responsibility? Ev- 
ery man his own master? They 
have no children to test themselves 
against— something to do with the 
closed system — so pride incurs no 
obligations and accepts none. Only 
^ stranger can kick his way out of 
this paper bag.’’ 

“They don’t look stupid to me.’’ 
“Ravenshaw, I wouldn’t think 
you stupid leading a squad or 
maybe a platoon — but I’ve noticed 
that army officers, clergy and pro- 
fessors always buy enough phony 
oil stock to paper their walls. You 
people live in a protected situation, 
inside a security framework, like 



monkeys in a zoo. You are public 
welfare cases. Me? I had to cut out 
a tin beak and peck around with 
the rest of the chickens.’’ 

“So why did they fight at the 
springs — when we first came 
here?’’ 

“That was a joint venture. A 
limited-liability company had gone 
out to get fresh water and exercise 
the eight-wheeled steam hoopee. 
Another band of gentleman ad- 
venturers jumped them. We just 
happened to show up in the mid- 
dle. Ravenshaw, how did we get 
into this world? Tell me, and I’ll 
arrange some accommodation.’’ 
“Just lucky, I guess.’’ 

The old man favored him with a 
basilisk glance and shrugged. “Call 
me stout Cortez,’’ he said. 

“Pizarro is a real sweet guy, 
too,’’ said Ravenshaw. 

“I’ll miss your conversation,’’ 
said Mummery, “but not much.’’ 
He stood and stretched and left 
the room. 

T HE girl walked in and patted 
Ravenshaw’s cheek as she 
crossed to the phone. She activated 
the light cylinder. A person ap- 
peared. Ravenshaw didn’t care if 
the instrument was a vid or a see- 
easy or an Ojo de Dios, an Eye of 
God. This was a funny-money 
world. Where was Nell Rowley? 
They ought to cut out of here. 
f The girl spoke to a man with red 
hair and a freckled face who ap- 
peared in the cylinder of light. “I

think the woman is something 
called a Mier and they’re a trick- 
some species. It turns out they dis- 
appear and the library hahs and 
hums about whys and hows and 
whatever — keep an eye on her.” 

Freckles leaned forward to 
touch controls. “She’s solid 
enough,” he said as the cylinder 
enlarged to include Nell. 

Nell had a stony expression. Her 
head stuck out of a box that was 
like a steam cabinet. She looked at 
Ravenshaw in his wrappings and 
smiled. “Well, Arleigh. Quite a 
world, isn’t it?” 

“Amscray!” said Ravenshaw in 
a choked voice. 

“Utsnay,” said Nell. “How do I 
get out of this box? Besides, I’ve 
been to a lot of trouble over you. I 
might not be able to get back.” 

Colonel Ravenshaw said, 
“That’s an order!” 

His detachment had vanished. It 
fried the edges of his soul to see 
Nell with her head sticking out of 
a box. He turned red, lurched for- 
ward and tumbled to the floor, 
chair and all. He got a sideways 
look at her eyes before Freckles 
dimished the cylinder to himself. 
He had never thought violet could 
be such a hot color. He was wet 
with sweat, 

“ — keep them around for jollies 
maybe, why not?” the girl said, 
and the projection faded. She 
walked over and nudged Raven- 
shaw with her toe. “Don’t go away. 
A closed system needs variety and 
the entertainer should be worthy 



of his audience. Those two old 
men have amusing ideas and men 
are as alike as feathered balls and 
what does one ball more or less 
matter?” She hunkered down and 
regarded him more closely. “And 
yet — you are a beast of some char- 
acter — who can tell? Raised under 
a different sun — or the same sun — 
there’s disagreement on the ques- 
tion.” She frowned. “Still, it might 
be best if you were scrubbed. 

Her words registered for later 
examination. Ravenshaw lay on 
the floor and repeated Nell’s jin- 
gle. With all the intensity he could 
command, he wanted her back in 
their own world. He screwed down 
his eyelids until his eyes hurt. He 
had not forgotten a vivid picture 
she had once given him of a small 
girl in the shade of a chinaberry 
tree, singing a lonely song to her 
doll, Elinor: 

The worlds exist in the mind 
alone — 

Who knows this truth can dance 
with fire 

Or fly through air or float on 
stone . 

They were not magic words that 
spilled you through worlds like a 
riffled deck of cards. The song was 
conditioning to the idea that infi- 
nite worlds existed thicker than 
fruit on a chinaberry tree. It might 
also indicate that labels of body 
and mind were devisive and if an 
individual held unity at a level of 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD 



59

belief, such things as dancing with 
fire or jumping worlds or sailing 
on a boulder were possible. Id, ego, 
super-ego? Jargon. Don't look at 
the tree trunks or the snake or the 
wall of the building, dammit, look 
at the elephant whole. 

Then all worlds were funny- 
money worlds, just like a Pancho 
Villa ten-peso note when Pancho 
himself presented it to a store- 
keeper. It was irrelevant that it was 
homemade. It was legal tender 
when backed by a .45 revolver. If 
the storekeeper thought it was fun- 
ny-money, he had a weak grip on 
reality. 

Go, Nell, go! 

Just because Ravenshaw had 
been an idiot when he stepped into 
the helicopter and it seemed inad- 
visable to change worlds in the air, 
and he was fuddled when Ned Va- 
su jumped Mummery all this 
was no reason why Nell should be 
stuck in a box. 

Go, Nell, go! 

Two husky young men heaved 
the chair back onto its legs. Rav- 
enshaw opened his eyes because he 
had been washed over by a sense of 
comfort. He drew the conclusion 
that Nell had escaped, switched 
worlds, was out of danger. It was 
the same relief a skindiver knows 
after two minutes under water. 

Mummery was back in his chair 
talking with Jain. 

Jain enlarged the cylinder of vi- 
sion and there was Nell Rowley 
with her eyes shut and a faint 



61 




smile on her face, still prisoned in 
the box. 

VII 

W HEN three men unrolled the 
rope and led him to another 
room, Ravenshaw waited until his 
reflexes seemed dependable before 
he kicked one in the stomach, 
backhanded another in the adam’s 
apple and chopped the third under 
the ear with the side of his hand. 
Cay appeared and pointed to a 
door. He slammed it open and ran 
into a crowd. He turned and Cay 
had another gang of men running 
to meet him. It was a brief excur- 
sion into freedom. 

They spreadeagled him over 
their heads and carried him 
through the interminable ware- 
house. When one tired, another 
took his place. Ravenshaw had no 
idea that gripping hands could be 
so painful. They were whooping 
and yelling and singing, men and 
women, the whole mob, and all his 
addled brain could do was repeat, 
“If it wasn’t for the honor of the 
thing — if it wasn’t for the honor of 
the thing — ’’ He was too scram- 
bled to finish Mark Twain’s re- 
marks about the man tarred and 
feathered, riding on a rail. When 
he was stood on his feet with the 
world reeling around him, he knew 
he would rather be elsewhere — ex- 
cept for the honor — and he would 
have fallen to the floor except for 
two dozen hands supporting him. 



His vision cleared and he identi- 
fied the wet stuff as a nose-bleed 
dripping off his chin. He might as 
well have stayed dizzy, because the 
building in which he found himself 
was unreasonable, unfamiliar and 
unlike anything in his experience. 
Bleachers followed the curve of 
the oval dome on either side, but 
between the tiered seats was a gulf, 
a void where a basketball court 
might have been. There was a pier, 
a stack, a tower in the middle, a 
central oval island rising from the 
depths, repeating the curve of the 
seats. The tunnel from the north 
was on the east side. The tunnel 
through which he had been hauled 
was to the right. The gulf was a 
constant width from one end of 
the building to the other. The roof 
arched overhead in the ambiguous 
blur. 

Latecomers straggled in. The 
bleachers were almost full. The 
spectators got to their feet when 
the doors of the tunnels closed. It 
was kickoff time. A cylinder of 
light appeared in the middle of the 
oval platform. A man with a be- 
nign expression stood there. His 
voice carried without distortion, 
but Ravenshaw could catch only 
parts of the speech, due to the tu- 
mult of boos and catcalls. 

“ — resources and ingenuity of 
our community — twenty-six years 
in conception and planning, eight 
years to build and supply — chosen 
genetic stock — no immediate re- 
turn from this colossal investment 



62 



IF 




” When the audience chanted 
along with the speaker, Raven- 
shaw realized this must be a re- 
cording and wearisomely familiar. 
44 — transmogrified to men beyond 
man, mankind changed in one gen- 
eration — ” He lost the rest in the 
hoots and shouting and caught 
only the conclusion. “ — so in 
trust and love, bless you, our chil- 
dren.” 

The projection faded. A bridge 
like a tongue of steel arched to the 
island. It rose up and out, three 
feet wide with no rails. It was 
white and made a smooth join at 
the far side. First class engineering, 
was Ravenshaw’s opinion. 

The girl who looked so much 
like Cay walked onto the island 
dressed in ice-blue, a shimmering 
garment that must have been un- 
comfortably tight from her toes to 
her neck, where it broke into a 
frothy collar framing her face in 
blue ice. She waited for relative 
quiet. 

“Anybody want to jump?” she 
said. “I deplore private suicide. 
It’s deprivation of us all, selfish 
and a nuisance, and you might 
just as well make an occasion of 
this. If you need something fanci- 
er than jumping — remember, only 
two people missed all the pipes and 
there’s a challenge — talk it over 
with your friends. The spirit of our 
new world demands a little con- 
sideration, not much maybe, but 
some. We’ll arrange anything rea- 
sonable, hanging, head-chopping. 



whatever you want. Any takers?” 
She waited and said, “Second 
item’s transfers. Come on over, 
anybody.” Eleven men and women 
crossed the bridge and stood to 
one side. The girl stepped on and 
the bridge retracted. The bridge 
from the other side slid out to the 
island. Freckles rode it over. Eight 
people followed him and cleared 
the way for the transfers. 

“I have old business and con- 
tinuing business and dammit,” 
said Freckles. The gabble of the 
audience dropped. “I know we got 
entertainment tonight and I don’t 
want to naggle anybody, but those 
clowns who busted out after water 
had a good time and a nice fight, 
but they’re going to yince us up. 
Maybe a session tomorrow? Think 
about it, dammit — we’re either a 
closed system or we’re not. They 
had us programed to bury seeds in 
the ground, dammit, three years 
ago dammit, and build houses arid 
raise kids and all that, and I still 
say the hell with it and those 
clowns are going to yince us up 
good. Think about it.” 

His bridge sucked in and the 
girl’s went out. The transfers 
walked over and found seats. She 
said, “Don’t yell the bridge, the 
bridge at me because nobody’s fig- 
ured how to schtunk the system 
yet. Library says we’re positive 
and negative and you shove some- 
thing between and bang, it blows. 
And those guys who busted out 
found out how to bust out, so why 



ONE-GENERATION NEW WORLD 



63 




worry about a bridge anyway?” 
There was a chorus of boos and 
die thumbed her nose at both 
sides. She stuck out her tongue, 
patted her head and pointed a fin- 
ger down. That was evidently a 
ruder gesture because it was 
greeted with shouts of laughter 
and anger. “Fahngulah!” she said. 
A witty riposte, thought Raven- 
shaw, because everybody laughed. 
“Entertainment!” she yelled, and 
he was shoved onto the bridge. 

L ONG bamboo sticks urged 
'him forward. He stumbled and 
got a good ldok at an oily, churn- 
ing liquid two hundred feet below. 
A wind sucked down. There was a 
maze of large and small pipes 
from the wall to the stack, color 
coded, entering at all angles and 
elevations. Offhand, he didn’t be- 
lieve a sockful of oatmeal could 
make it down to the liquid without 
hitting a pipe. A stick popped him 
in the neck and he wrenched it out 
of the hands of a man behind him, 
and staggered to the island. He 
turned to the girl, but she avoided 
him neatly. He could have tipped 
her into the void, but saw no point 
to it. 

When she cleared the bridge, a 
turkel started briskly up the far 
side. 

“This is a heat-seeker,” said 
Mummery. “Don’t suppose it’s 
been activated for a coon’s age.” 
Ravenshaw found the old man di- 
recting a horn at him from the 



middle of the bleachers. “Big 
problem with warehousing is ver- 
min. If the rats don’t get you, the 
mice will.” 

The turkel turned toward Rav- 
enshaw as the bridge retracted. It 
spawned two sixteen-inch snakes 
before he got his stick under the 
edge and tipped it into the gulf. 
Three more wriggled out in the 
air. There was a cling-clang- 
whanging noise as they bounced on 
pipes. The snakes darted at him. 
They were covered with short, fine 
wire for traction; their micromin- 
iaturized sensing gear was elegant. 
When he tried to smash one with 
the stick, it avoided the blow and 
kept coming in. It chewed on his 
toe and he stomped it with the oth- 
er foot. He bent down and swept 
off the second with his stick. 

“Watch out, Arleigh!” Nell 
shouted over the crowd noise. She, 
too, had a horn. 

From the other side another tur- 
kel unloaded snakes and they wrig- 
gled toward him. He ran to the far 
end of the oval. The little mechan- 
ical monster had chewed through 
his boot with a rotating blade and 
he had a shuddersome idea of 
what a dozen might do. Cut off 
my legs and call me Shorty. He 
kneeled with the gulf behind him 
and, as the snakes converged, he 
swept them away with the stick, 
one side and the other, until they 
were gone. Both bridges were re- 
tracted now. He tipped the mother 
turkel off and had time to look for

IF 




Nell. Jain had wrestled the horn 
from her hand and spoke into it. 

“See how you like the old hot- 
foot.” 

“Pre-emergence weed flamer,” 
said Mummery from the other 
side. “Give you something to think 
about. Of course, you can use it 
for mature row crops if you have 
the right baffles — ” 

Ravenshaw ran to the center of 
the oval. The first turkel was al- 
most to the island, shooting out 
blue flame around its edges. Fol- 
lowing across the bridge were, five 
more firespitters. Ravenshaw 
leaped onto the back of the first 
through a blast of heat, caught his 
balance on the rounded surface 
and took desperate six-foot strides 
on the backs of the others over the 
bridge. With momentum, he scat- 
tered spectators right and left as 
he leaped up the bleachers. 

He had Mummery by his an- 
tique throat before he heard Jain 
yelling on the horn, “Choke the 
old bastard and I stab the girl!” 

H E LOOKED across the gulf. 

Jain had. his knife at Nell's 
breast. 

“All right. Maybe we can make 
a deal.” Ravenshaw tucked Mum- 
mery's head in the crook of his 
arm, told him to come along or 
he’d tear it off, and returned across 
the bridge to the island. The crowd 
was in a tumult. They enjoyed the 
action and took a while to settle 
down for the next act. 



Jain said, “l changed my mind.. 
Go ahead and strangle him.” 

The girl. Cay, had followed Rav- 
enshaw across the bridge. She 
came up and kissed him full on the 
mouth. “It’s immoral, but go 
ahead and stick her,” she shouted 
to Jain. Ravenshaw dropped the 
old man. She announced further: 
“I’ll take him dirty and forlorn 
and we’ll make you silly clowns 
cringe, won’t we, poppet?” 

“In a pig’s valise you will,” said 
Ravenshaw. 

She slapped him broadhanded. 
He jerked her to him by the collar 
of her suit and spanked her over 
his knee. The crowd went wild. 
This was the best entertainment in 
years. He dropped Cay and caught 
Mummery before he reached the 
bridge and dragged him to the mid- 
dle of the oval. He could not see 
Nell in the surging crowd. Cay 
was back on her own side and 
Freckles rode his bridge to the is- 
land with Jain in his grasp. 

“Weapons are immoral and vio- 
lence is nasty,” said Freckles. He 
dropped the old man and retreated. 
Ravenshaw welcomed him aboard 
with a kick that drove him sprawl- 
ing after Mummery to one end of 
the oval. 

He looked again for Nell and 
could not see her in the cheering 
crowd. The bridge was alive with 
fire. New turkels advanced, shoot- 
ing a blaze that made the bleach- 
ers waver in the heat. The six tur- 
kels already on the island met

those from the other side. The 
twelve formed a line and advanced 
slowly on Ravenshaw. The old 
men were at the other end of the 
oval. Both bridges were withdrawn. 

“Uh-oh, dance with fire or fly 
through air?” said Ravenshaw soft- 
ly. He retreated. He was bloody 
and battered. He was on an alien 
world with the choice of being 
broiled or bouncing two hundred 
feet through a web of pipe to the 
sewer works. 

The wall of flame advanced. He 
stood on the edge of the drop. He 
looked at the ceiling. It was prop- 
erly described as a surface of re- 
volution around an axis. These 
people had revolved around an un- 
expected axis, no matter the fore- 
thought and idealism of the build- 
ers. The far limits of the beast are 
unknown, though certain predis- 
positions have been observed in 
6000 years of history. A revolting 
development. Ravenshaw sheltered 
his face from the furnace blast 
with his hands and said, “It only 
hurts when I laugh. 1 ' 

So why couldn't he be all things 
at once, scared spitless, raging 
mad, filled with apprehension for 
Nell and laughing? 

Look at the elephant whole. 
Keep cool^ Ravenshaw. 

A creeping blue flame licked the 
fuzz of his trousers. 

Believe or bum, my dear Raven- 
shaw. 

A whole man vanished from the 
One-Generation New World. 



I T WAS dark and cold. Raven- 
shaw brushed out the little fires. 
Hard pellets of snow rattled on the 
ground. He was standing at the 
corner of a corral next to Mum- 
mery's ranch house up Meadow 
Valley Wash in his own world. 
That thing was the D-8 tractor, 
cat-yellow, cat-black in the bitter 
night. His foot slipped on the ice 
when he climbed up and he just 
avoided breaking his neck. He 
took the tin can off the stack and 
put down the seat. He was shiver- 
ing with cold by the time he got 
the big diesel going. It blew smoke 
rings, tattered away by the wind, 
and he shuddered as the engine 
smoothed to a responsive bellow. 
He advanced the throttle and 
raised the blade in front and the 
rippers behind. He located a gear, 
pulled the friction, spun around 
and rumbled to the corner of the 
corral in which he had found him- 
self. He rode over the posts, and 
stopped. 

“Come back often, now that 
you know the way,'' he growled. 

Cat and man vanished. 

T HEY appeared just about 
where Ravenshaw wanted to be, 
on the island between retracted 
bridges. Only a few people were 
left of the crowds on either side. 
Jain was sulking at one end of the 
long oval, Mummery at the other. 
Nell was nowhere in sight. He left 
the diesel idling and stood up. The 
two wise men stared at him, wild

and bloody on the snow-encrusted 
cat. 

“I’ll read the future/' said Rav- 
enshaw, “not that you'll take the 
advice. Hang together or you'll 
hang separately." 

Mummery said, “They left us 
here — awfully nice of you — " 

Jain blinked his owl eyes. 

“Angle the blade and bridge the 
cat," said Ravenshaw. “Maybe 
you can reach the side before the 
balance point. Maybe you can't. 
I'll miss you, gentlemen, but not 
much." 

He vanished. 

N ELL ROWLEY fell into step 
beside him as he walked from 
the corral to the house. “I got 
lost," she said. 

The kitchen door was unlocked 
or Ravenshaw would have kicked 
it in. When he turned on the light 
switch a generator started up, 
fluorescents stuttered to brightness 
and he got a good look at her. 
There was blood, still wet, on her 
horrible plaid shirt. He held him- 
self stiff as a glass man. 

“A dozen frantic worlds," she 
said, “all wrong." 

He cleared his throat. “I’ll tell 
you what let’s," he said huskily. 
“Let’s not touch a thing — ’’ 

“I homed on you," she said. 
“That’s what let’s not touch. I 
want a shower and shave and a set 
of the old man’s pinks. I don’t like 
this place, any part of it— there’s 
bound to be a car or pickup — we’ll 



get our stuff at McCarran — save 
water in Las Vegas — if you like — " 
The hottest violet eyes in the 
world blazed affirmation. 

“With a friend?" she said in her 
honey voice.' “All right to touch a 
coffeepot?" she asked and the 
bones melted in his legs. 

“Yarp," he croaked and stum- 
bled away. 

M UCH later on that night she 
said drowsily, “Break the 
pipes or make a permanent bridge 
—either opens the closed system." 

“Uh-huh, they gotta turn to the 
real world, cat or no." 

“Two buildings are sound psy- 
chological engineering," she 
mused. “You get rivalry, romance, 
mystery, someplace to go — " 
“Uh-huh." He was altogether 
relaxed. “If you’re going to change 
a world, how do you program the 
programers?" 

“Very carefully." She yawned. 
“What time is it?" He thought of 
a cat yawning, the tip of its pink 
tongue quivering. He grinned with 
pure delight in the dark. She stuck 
an elbow in his ribs. “What do we 
tell the general?" 

“Lady, we’re on our own time." 
“We ought to catch the seven- 
o’clock plane." 

“All right," said Ravenshaw, 
“but hush for now. This is the 
first morning of the rest of my life 
and I want to start it right." 

“Sententious, Arleigh dear — ’’ 
she said, and fell silent. •

No room left in 
the world — but there 



T HE day I formed my connec- 
tion with March B. Street has 
remained extraordinarily well fixed 
in my memory. This shows, of 
course, that my unconsious— my 
monitor, 1 should say; you must 
pardon me if I sometimes slip into 
these anthropomorphic terms; it's 
the influence of my profession- 
What was I saying? Oh, yes. My 
monitor, which of course sorts 
through my stored data during 
maintenance periods and wipes the 
obsolete material out of core, re- 
gards the connection as quite im- 
portant. A tenuous connection, you 
will say. Yes, but it has endured. 

The hour was late. 1 had finished 
the last of my house calls and it was 
raining. I may be more careful of 
my physical well-being than I 
should be, but my profession 
makes me so and,, after all, quite a 
number of people depend on me. 
At any rate, instead of walking to 
my quarters as was my custom 1 
bought a paper and seated myself 
in a kiosk to read and await the 
eventual arrival of the monorail. 

In twenty minutes I had read 
everything of interest and laid the 
paper on the bench beside my bag. 
After some five minutes spent 
watching the gray rain and think- 
ing about some of my more trou- 
blesome patients I picked it up 
again and began (my room being, 
in several respects, less than satis- 
factory) to leaf through the real 
estate ads. I believe I can still re- 
member the exact wording: 



Single Professional wishes to 
share apt. (exp. cist.) Quiet 
hbts, no entrtnng. Cr8/mo. 

The cost was below what I was 
paying for my room and the idea of 
an apartment —even if it were only 
an expanded closet and would have 
to be shared -was appealing. It 
was closer to the center of the city 
than was my room, and on the 
same mono line. I thought about it 
as I boarded, and when we reached 
the stop nearest it (Cathedral) I 
got off. 

The building was old and small, 
faced with unlightened concrete 
time had turned nearly black. The 
address I sought was on the twen- 
ty-seventh floor; what had once 
been a single apartment had been 
opened out into a complex by 
means of space expanders, whose 
all-pervading hum greeted me as I 
opened the door. One had, for a 
moment, the sensation of tumb- 
ling head first into gulfs of empti- 
ness. Then a little woman, the land- 
lady, came fluttering up to ask 
what it was I wanted. She was, as I 
saw at once, a declassed human. 

I showed her the ad. “Ah,” she 
said. “That’s Mr. Street, but I 
don’t think he’ll be wanting any of 
your sort. Of course, that’s up to 
him.” 

I could have mentioned the Civil 
Liberties Act, but I only said, 
“He’s a human, then? The ad said, 
“Single Professional.” Naturally I 
thought—”

“Well, you would, wouldn't 
you,” the little woman said, look- 
ing at the ad again over my shoul- 
der. “He’s not like me. I mean even 
if he is declassed, he’s still young. 
Mr. Street’s a strange one.” 

“You don’t mind if I inquire, 
then?” 

“Oh, no. I just didn’t want to see 
you disappointed.” She was 
looking at my bag. “You’re a doc- 
tor?” 

“A bio-mechanic.” 

“That’s what we used to call 
them — doctors. It’s over there.” 

It had been a hat and coat closet, 

I suppose, in the original apart- 
ment. There was a small brass 
plate on the door: 

MARCH B. STREET 
CONSULTING 
ENGINEER 
& 

DETECTIVE 

1 WAS reading it for the second 
time when the door opened and 
I asked, quite without thinking how 
it might sound, “What in the world 
does a consulting engineer do?” 

“He consults,” Mr. Marche 
Street answered. “Are you a client, 
sir?” 

And that was how I met him. I 
should have been impressed — I 
mean, had I known — but as it was I 
was only flustered. I told him I had 
come about the apartment and he 
asked me in very politely. It was an 
immense place, filled to bursting 



with machines in various stages of 
disassembly and furniture. “Not 
pretty,” Mr. Street remarked, 
“but it’s home.” 

“I had no idea it would be so big. 
You must have—” 

“Three expanders, each six hun- 
dred horsepower. There's plenty of 
space out there between the galax- 
ies, so why not pull it down here 
where we need it?” 

“The cost, I should say, for one 
thing. I suppose that’s why you 
want to — ” 

“Share the apartment? Yes, 
that’s one reason. How do you like 
the place?” 

“You mean you’d consider me? 1 
should think — ” 

“Do you know you talk very 
slowly? It makes it damned diffi- 
cult not to interrupt you. No, I 
wouldn’t prefer a human. Sit down, 
won’t you? What’s your name?” 
“Westing,” I said. “It’s a silly 
name, really — like naming a hu- 
man Tommy or Jimmy. But the old 
‘Westinghouse’ was out of style 
when I was assembled.” 

“Which makes you about fifty- 
six, confirmed by ihe degree of 
wear I see at your knee seals, which 
are originals. You’re a bio- 
mechanic, by your bag— which 
should be handy. You haven’t 
much money; you’re honest — and 
obviously not much of a talker. 
You came here by mono, and I’d 
almost be willing to swear you 
presently live high up in a fairly 
new building.” 



70 



IF 




“How in the world — ” 

“Quite simple, really, Westing. 
You haven’t money or you 
wouldn’t be interested in an apart- 
ment. You’re honest or you’d have 
money — no one has more and 
better chances to steal than a bio- 
mechanic. When a passenger with a 
transfer boards the mono the 
conductor rips up the ticket and, 
half the time, drops it on the 
floor — and one is stuck to your 
foot with gum. And lightened con- 
crete and plastic facades have giv- 
en us buildings so tall and spindly- 
framed that the upper floors sway 
under the wind load like ships. 
People who live or work in them 
take to bracing themselves the way 
sailors used to — as I notice you’re 
doing on that settee.” 

“You are an extraordinary per- 
son,” I managed to say, “and it 
makes me all the more sur- 
prised — ” And here I am afraid I 
stopped speaking and leaned for- 
ward to stare at him. 

“Extraordinary in more ways 
than one, I’m afraid,” Street said. 
“But although I assure you I will 
engage you as my physician if I am 
ever ill, I haven’t done so yet.” 
“Quite so,” I admitted. I re- 
laxed, but I was still puzzled. 

“Are you still interested in shar- 
ing my little apartment, then? Shall 
I show you about?” 

“No,” I said. 

“I understand,” Street said, 
“and I apologize for having wasted 
your time. Doctor.” 



“I don’t want to be shown the 
door, either.” Though I was upset, 
I must admit 1 felt a thrill of some- 
what guilty pleasure at being able 
to contradict my host. “1 want to 
sit here and think for a minute.” 
“Of course,” Street said, and 
was silent. 

L IVING with a declassed human 
(and there was no use in my de- 
ceiving myself — that was what was 
being proposed) was a raffish sort 
of thing. It was bound to hurt my 
practice, but then my practice was 
largely among declassed humans 
already and could not get much 
worse. The vast spaces of the 
apartment, even littered as they 
were, were attractive after years 
in a single cramped room. 

But most of all, or so I like to 
think, it was the personality of 
Street himself which decided 
me — and the fact that I detected in 
him, perhaps only by some 
professional instinct not wholly 
rational, a physical abnormality I 
could not quite classify. And there 
was, in addition, the pleasing 
thought of surprising my few 
friends, all of whom, I knew, 
thought me much too stuffy to do 
any such outlandish thing. I was 
giving Street my money — half a 
month’s rent on the apartment — 
when he froze, head cocked, to lis- 
ten to some sound from the foyer. 

After a moment he said, “We 
have a visitor, Westing. Hear 
him?” 



SLAVES OF SILVER

“I heard someone out there.” 
“The light and tottering step is 
that of our good landlady, Mrs. 
Nash. But there is another 
tread — dignified, yet nervous. 
Almost certainly a client.” 

“Or someone else to ask about 
the apartment,” I suggested. 

“No.” 

Before I could object to this flat 
contradiction the door opened to 
show the birdlike woman who had 
admitted us. She ushered in a dis- 
tinguished-looking person well 
over two meters tall, whose po- 
lished and lavish solid chrome trim 
gave unmistakable evidence, if not 
of wealth, then at least of a suf- 
ficiency I — and millions of 
others — would only envy all our 
lives. 

“You are Street?” he asked, 
looking at me with a somewhat 
puzzeled expression. 

“This is my associate, Dr. West- 
ing,” Street said. “I am the man 
you came to see, Coniissioner 
Electric. Won’t you sit down?” 

“I’m flattered that you know my 
name,” Electric said. 

“Over there past the nickelode- 
on,” Street told him, “you’ll see a 
cleared spot for tri-D displays. 
There are several cameras around 
it. Whenever a man I don’t know 
appears I photograph the image for 
later reference. You were inter- 
viewed three months ago in con- 
nection with your request for ad- 
ditional expanders for the hiring 
hall, made necessary by the de- 



pressed state of the economy.” 

“Yes.” Electric nodded and it 
was plain that Street’s recital of 
these simple facts, accurate as it 
was, had depressed still further 
spirits already hovering at the 
brink of despair. “You have no 
conception, Mr. Street, of how 
ironic it seems that I should hear 
now — here — of that routine re- 
quest for funds, and so be re- 
minded of those days when our hall 
was filled to bursting with the 
deactivated.” 

“From which,” Street said slow- 
ly, “I take it that the place is now 
empty — or nearly so. I must say I 
am surprised; I had believed the 
economy to be in worse 
condition — if that is possible — 
than it was three months past.” 

“It is,” Electric admitted. “And 
your first supposition is also cor- 
rect — the hall, though not empty, is 
far from crowded.” 

“Ah,” said Street. 

“This thing has been driving me 
to the brink of reprograming for 
six weeks now. The deactivated are 
being stolen. The police pretend to 
be accomplishing something; but 
it’s obvious they are helpless — 
they’re only going through the mo- 
tions now. Last night a relative of 
mine — I won’t name him, but he is 
a highly placed military officer — 
suggested that I come to you. He 
didn’t mention you were a de- 
classed human, and I suppose he 
knew that if he had I wouldn’t have 
come, but now that I’ve seen you 



72 



IF 




I’m willing to take a chance.” 
‘That’s kind of you,” Street said 
dryly. ‘‘In the event I succeed in 
preventing further thefts by 
bringing the criminals to justice my 
fee will be — ” He named an astro- 
nomical sum. 

‘‘And in the event further thefts 
are not prevented?” 

‘‘My expenses only.” 

44TVONE. You realize that these 
-l-^thefts strike at the very fab- 
ric of our society, Mr. Street. The 
old rallying cry, Free markets and 
free robots , may be a joke now to 
some, but it has built our civiliza- 
tion. Robots are assembled when 
the demand for labor exceeds the 
supply. When supply exceeds de- 
mand — that is, in practical terms, 
when the excess cybercitizens can’t 
make a living — they turn them- 
selves in at the hiring hall, where 
they’re deactivated until they’re 
needed again. If news of these 
shortages should leak out — ” 

‘‘Who would turn himself in to 
be stolen, eh?” said Street. ‘‘I see 
what you mean.” 

“Precisely. The unemployed 
would resort to begging and theft, 
just as in the old days. We already 
have — I hope you’ll excuse 
me — enough of a problem with 
declassified humans. You yourself 
are obviously an exception, but you 
must know*what most of them are 
like.” 

“Most of us,” Street replied 
mildly, “are like my landlady: peo- 



ple who lost class because they re- 
fused death at the end of their na- 
tural lifespans. It’s not very easy to 
learn to earn your living when for a 
hundred years of life society has 
handed you an income big enough 
to make you rich.” 

It wasn’t really my affair, but I 
couldrrt help saying, “But if you 
can help Commissioner Electric, 
Street, you’ll be helping your own 
people in exactly this area.” 

Street turned his eyes — which 
were of an intense blue, as though 
his photosensors were arcing— to 
me. “Is that so, Doctor? I’m afraid 
I don’t quite follow you.” 

Electric said, “I should think it’s 
obvious. Surely the motive for 
stealing our deactivated workers 
must be the desire to use them as 
forced labor, presumably in a se- 
cret factory of some sort. If this is 
being done, the criminals are com- 
peting illegally with everyone try- 
ing to earn an honest living — in- 
cluding the declassed.” 

I nodded my emphatic agree- 
ment. The thought of an illicit fac- 
tory, perhaps in a cavern or aban- 
doned mine, filled with dim figures 
laboring without cease under the 
threat of destruction, had already 
come to haunt my imagination. 

“Slaves of silver,” I muttered 
half aloud, “toiling in the dark.” 
“Possibly,” Street said. “But I 
can think of other possibilities — 
possibilities you might find more 
shocking still.” 

“In any event,” Commissioner

Electric put in, “you will want to 
visit the hiring hall.” 

“Yes, but not in company with 
you. I consider it quite possible 
that the entrance may be watched. 
Human beings do visit the hall 
from time to time, I assume?” 
“Yes, usually to engage domes- 
tics.” 

“Excellent. Under what circum- 
stances would you deal with such 
visitors personally?” 

“I would not ordinarily do so at 
all, unless all my subordinates were 
engaged.” 

Street looked at me. “You seem 
to want to be a party to this, West- 
ing. Are you game to visit the hir- 
ing hall with me? You must con- 
sider that you may disappear — for 
that matter we both may.” 

“Oh, no,” Electric protested, 
“the disappearances occur only af- 
ter dark, when the hall is closed.” 
“Certainly I’ll come.” 

Street smiled. “I thought you 
would. Commissioner, we will fol- 
low you in one half hour. See to it 
that when we arrive your subordi- 
nates are engaged.” 

W HEN the commissioner had 
gone I was able to ask Street 
the question that had been nagging 
at my mind during the entire inter- 
view. 

“Street, for God’s own sake, 
how was it you knew Commis- 
sioner Electric hadn’t come about 
the apartment before Mrs. Nash 
had opened the door?” 



“Be a good fellow and look in 
the drawer of the inlaid rosewood 
table you’ll find on the other side of 
that camera obscura to the left of 
the tri-D stage, and I’ll tell you. 
You ought to find a recording am- 
meter in there. We’ll need it.” 

I didn’t know what a camera 
obscura was, but fortunately the 
rosewood table was a rather strik- 
ing piece and only one instrument 
was in its drawer, lying amid a lit- 
ter of tarot cards and bridge score 
pads. I held it up for Street to see 
and he nodded. “That’s it. You see. 
Westing, when someone arrives in 
answer to a newspaper ad he 
almost invariably — ninety-two 
point six percent of the time, ac- 
cording to my calculation — car- 
ries the paper with him and shows 
it to the person who answers the 
door. When I failed to hear the 
telltale rattie of the popular press 
as our visitor addressed Mrs. Nash 
I knew there was little chance that 
he had come about the apartment.” 

“Astounding!” 

“Oh, it’s not so much,” Street 
said modestly. “But get a move on, 
won’t you? It wouldn’t do to ride 
down in the same elevator with 
Electric— but on the other hand it’s 
seldom a waste of askance to view 
a public official with it. We’re 
going to shadow him.” 

Despite Street’s suspicions, 
Commissioner Electric did noth- 
ing untoward that I could see while 
we followed him. To give him time 
to prepare for us, as Street said, we

idled for a quarter of an hour or 
more at the window of a tri-D store 
near the hall. The show being 
carried on the display set inside 
was utterly banal and 1 could swear 
that Street did not give it even a 
fraction of his attention. He stood, 
absorbed in his own thoughts, 
while I fidgeted. 

The hiring hall, when Electric 
guided us around it, we found to be 
a huge place; impressive from 
outside but immensely larger with- 
in and filled with the hum of ex- 
panders. The corridors were lined 
with persons of every age and state 
of repair— they stretched for slight- 
ly curved miles like the vistas seen 
in opposed mirrors. Gaping spaces 
showed where the disappearances 
had taken place, but, sinister as 
they were, in time they seemed a 
relief from the staring regard of 
those thousands of unseeing eyes. 
Street asked for data on each theft 
and recorded the date and the 
number of persons missing in a 
notebook; but there seemed to be 
no pattern to the crimes, save that 
all the disappearances took place 
at night. 

At last we came to the end of 
that vast building. Commissioner 
Electric did not ask Street for his 
opinion of the case (though I could 
see he wanted to), nor did Street 
give it. But once we were fairly 
away from him, Street pacing im- 
patiently alongside the sidewalk 
while I trotted to keep up, he broke 
forth in an irascible tirade of self- 



abuse: “Westing, this thing is as 
simple as a two-foot piece of 
aluminum conduit and I’m confi- 
dent I know everything about 
it — except what I need to know. 
And I have no idea of how I’m 
going to find the answer. I know 
the robots are taken — I think. And 
I believe I know why. The question 
is: Who is responsible? If I could 
get the patrol to cooperate — ” 

He lapsed into a sour silence, 
unbroken until we were once more 
back in the huge, littered apart- 
ment I had not yet learned to call 
“ours.” Indeed, my arrangement 
with Street was so recent that I had 
not yet had an opportunity to shift 
my possessions from my old room 
or to terminate my tenancy there. I 
excused myself — though Street 
seemed hardly to notice — and 
attended to these things. 

W HEN I returned nothing had 
changed. Street sat, as be- 
fore, wrapped in gloom. And I, re- 
duced to despondency by his ex- 
ample and with nothing better to 
do in any case, sat watching him. 
After an hour had passed he rose 
from his chair and for a few mo- 
ments wandered disconsolately 
about the apartment, only to re- 
turn to the same seat and throw 
himself down, his face blacker — if 
that were possible — than before. 
“Street — ” I ventured. 

“Eh?” He looked up. “Westing? 
That’s your name, isn’t it? You still 
here?” 



SLAVES OF SILVER 



75 




“Yes. I’ve been watching you for 
some time. While I realize you 
have, no doubt, a regular medical 
advisor, you were once kind 
enough to say that you might call 
me. On the strength of that — ’’ 

“Well, out with it, man. What is 
it?’’ 

“There will be no fee, of course. 
I was going to say that though I 
don’t know what means of chemi- 
cal reality enhancement you em- 
ploy, it would appear to me that it 
has been a considerable time — ” 

“Since my last fix? Believe me, it 
has.” He laughed, a reaction I 
thought encouraging. 

“Then I would suggest — ” 

“I don’t use drugs. Westing. 
None at all.” 

“I didn’t mean to suggest any- 
thing strong— just a few pinks, say, 
or—” 

“I mean it, Westing. I don’t use 
pinks. Or blues. Or even whites. I 
don’t use anything except food, and 
little enough of that, water and 
air.” 

“You’re serious?” 

“Absolutely.” 

“Street, I find this incredible. 
We were taught at medical school 
that human beings — being, after 
all, a species evolved for a savanna 
landscape rather than our climax 
civilization — were unable to main- 
tain their sanity without pharma- 
ceutical relief.” 

“That may well be true, West- 
ing. Nevertheless, I do not use 
any.” 



This was too much for me to ab- 
sorb at once and while I tried to 
encode it Street fell back into his 
former gloom. 

“Street,” I said again. 

“What is it this time?” 

“Do you remember? When we 
first met I said that I detected in 
you, perhaps only by some profes- 
sional instinct not wholly rational, 
a physical abnormality I could not 
quite classify?” 

“You didn’t say anything of the 
sort. You may have thought it.” 

“I did. And I was right. Man, 
you don’t know how good this 
makes me feel.” 

“I have some comprehension of 
the intellectual rewards attendant 
on successful deduction.” 

“I’m sure you do. But now, if I 
may say so, a too-avid pursuit of 
those rewards has led you to a se- 
vere state of depression. A stimu- 
lant of some sort — ” 

“Not at all, Westing. Thought is 
my drug — and believe me it is both 
stimulating and frustrating. My 
need is for a soporific, and your 
conversation fills the bill better 
than anything you could pre- 
scribe.” 

This was said in so cheerful and 
bantering a way, albeit with a bare- 
ly perceptible touch of bitterness, 
that I could not resent it — and, in- 
deed, the marked improvement this 
little spate of Xalk had brought to 
Street’s mien emboldened me to 
continue at whatever risk to my 
vanity.

IF 




So I answered, “Your powers of 
concentration, admirable as they 
are, may yet be your undoing. Do 
you remember the quarter-hour we 
spent in front of a store window? 
Where the tri-D had such poor 
reception? I addressed you several 
times, but I would swear you heard 
none of my questions. ” 

“I heard every one of your ques- 
tions,” Street said, “and since none 
admitted to intelligent responses I 
ignored them all. And that tri-D, if 
not of the most exquisite quality, 
was at least better than passable. I 
apologize if I sound peevish, but 
really, Westing, you must learn to 
observe.” 

“I am not an engineer,” I re- 
plied, perhaps rather too stiffly, 
“and so I cannot say if the recep- 
tion in fact was at fault — but acute 
observation is a necessity in my 
profession and I can assure you 
that the color stability of the set on 
display was abominable.” 

“Nonsense. I was looking direct- 
ly at it for the entire time and I 
could, if necessary, describe each 
stupidity of programing in se- 
quence.” 

“Maybe you could,” I said. 
“And I don’t doubt your assertion 
that you were watching with com- 
mendable attention while we 
waited outside the hiring hall. But 
you quite obviously failed to ob- 
serve it when we left . You were 
talking excitedly, as I recall — and 
as you spoke we passed the win- 
dow again. The actors were blush- 



ing — if I may use that expression 
here — a sort of reddish-orange. 
Then they turned greenish blue, 
then really blue, and finally a shade 
of bright, cool green. In fact, they 
went through that whole cycle 
several times just during the time it 
took us to walk past the window.” 

T HE effect of this perhaps over- 
ly detailed and argumentative 
statement on Street was extraordin- 
ary. Instead of countering with ar- 
gument or denial, as I confess I ex- 
pected, for a few moments he sim- 
ply stared silently at me. Then he 
jumped to his feet and for half a 
minute or more paced the room in 
silent agitation, twice tripping over 
the same ball-clawed foot of the 
same late Victorian commode. 

At last he turned almost fiercely 
back to me and announced: 
“Westing, I believe I can recall the 
precise words I addressed to you as 
we passed that display. I will re- 
peat them to you now and I want 
you to tell me the exact point at 
which you noticed the color insta- 
bility you mentioned. I said: ‘West- 
ing, this thing is as simple as a two- 
foot piece of aluminum conduit 
and I’m confident I know ev- 
erything about it — except what I 
need to know. And I have no idea 
of how I’m going to find the an- 
swer. I know how the robots are 
taken — I think. And I believe I 
know why. The question is: Who is 
responsible? If I could get the 
patrol to cooperate — ’ at which 



SLAVES OF SILVER 



77 




point I broke off, I believe. Now, 
precisely where did you notice the 
reddish orange color you men- 
tioned — I believe that was the hue 
you noticed originally?" 

“To the best of my recollection. 
Street, it coincided with the word 
believe." 

“I said, 4 I know how the robots 
are taken — I think. And I 
believe — ' and at that point you 
noticed that the figures in the tri-D 
illusion blushed a color you have 
described as a reddish orange. Is 
that correct?" 

Dumfounded, I nodded. 

“Excellent. Among my other 
antiques. Westing, I have assem- 
bled a collection of paintings. 
Would it interest you to see them? 
You would be conferring a favor of 
no mean magnitude upon me." 

“I don’t see how— but certainly, 
if you wish." 

“Excellent again; particularly if, 
while drinking in their loveliness, 
you would take the trouble to point 
out to me the shades which most 
closely match the four colors you 
saw when the tri-D malfunctioned. 
But please be most exact — if the 
match is not perfect, you need not 
inform me." 

For an hour or more we pored 
over Street’s pictures, which were 
astoundingly varied and, for the 
most part, in a poor state of pres- 
ervation. In size they ranged from 
Indian miniatures smaller than 
coins to a Biblical cyclorama five 
meters high and (so Street told me) 



more than three kilometers in 
length. The greenish-blue long es- 
caped us, but at last I located it in 
an execrable depiction of Susanna 
and The Elders and the art display 
was abruptly terminated. Street 
told me bluntly— his manner would 
have been offensive if it had not 
been so obvious that his mind was 
totally engaged on a problem of 
formidable proportions — to amuse 
myself and buried himself in an 
assortment of ratty books and 
dusty charts, one of which, as I 
particularly remember, was like a 
rainbow bent into a full circle, with 
the blazing colors melting into one 
another like the infinitesimal 
quantities in a differential equa- 
tion. 

While he pondered over these the 
hours of evening rolled past on 
silent rubber wheels. Others, their 
day’s work done, might rest now; I 
waited. Humans, rich and fortu- 
nate or declassed, might sleep or 
busy themselves in those pointless 
naked tumblings which mean so lit- 
tle to us; Street worked. And at last 
I wondered if it might not be that 
we two were the only wakeful 
minds in the entire city. 

S UDDENLY Street was shaking 
me by the shoulder. “Westing," 
he exclaimed, “I have it— let me 
show you." I explained that I had 
taken advantage of his concentra- 
tion to edit my memory banks. 

Street shrugged my mumblings 
aside. “Here," he said. “Look at

this and let me explain. You told 
me, if you remember, that you saw 
a cycle of four colors and that this 
cycle was repeated several times." 

“That's correct." 

“Very well. Now observe. Has it 
ever occured to you to wonder how 
ROBOTS — yourself included— 
speak?" 

“I assume," 1 said with as much 
dignity as I could muster, “that 
somewhere in my monitor the var- 
ious words of the English language 
are stored as vibration patterns 
and — " 

“The Chinese system. No, I am 
convinced it must be something far 
more efficient. English is spoken 
with only a trifle more than sixty 
sounds; even the longest words are 
created by combining and recom- 
bining these— for examples we 
might use the a as it appears in arm , 
the r as in rat and the ch from chair 
to describe our inestimable landla- 
dy, Mrs. Nash. Combined in one 
fashion they give us char — her “pro- 
fession — but rearranged in another 
they contribute arch — her man- 
ner." 

“You mean that all of spoken 
English can be stored in my central 
processing unit as a mere sixty- 
place linear array?" 

“That is precisely what I've been 
saying." 

“Street, that’s marvelous! I'm 
not a religious man, but when I 
contemplate the ingenuity of those 
early programers and systems ana- 
lysts — " 



“Exactly. Now, I do not know 
the order in which the various En- 
glish sounds were listed, but there 
is an order which is very common- 
ly used in the texts to which I have 
referred. It is to list the" sounds al- 
phabetically and, within the alpha- 
betical sections, to order them 
from longest to shortest. Thus 
these lists begin with the long a of 
ale , followed by the half-long a of 
chaotic ; and this is followed in turn 
by the circumflex a of care , so that 
the whole reads like a temperance 
lecture. What I have done here is to 
take these sounds and space them 
evenly along the visible spec- 
trum." He held up a hand-drawn 
chart on which there were, how- 
ever, no colors, but only a multi- 
tude of names. 

“But," I objected, “only a few 
true colors exist and you said there 
were more than sixty—" 

“A few primary colors," he re- 
turned, “but believe me, Westing, 
if the artists were to make up a 
pallet containing every oil and wa- 
tercolor known to them there 
would be a great many more than 
sixty. As you may remember, you 
described the four colors you saw 
as reddish-orange, greenish-blue, 
true blue — which is just like you. 
Westing — and bright, cool green;" 

“Yes." 

“Afterward, when you pointed 
out these colors on canvas, I was 
able to identify them as scarlet 
lake, cyan blue, blue and viridian. 
Please observe that on my chart 



SLAVESOF SILVER

these correspond to the consonant 
sound p, the consonant A, the short 
e heard in end and the / sound of 
late” 

I considered this remarkable 
statement for a moment, then re- 
plied, “You seem to believe that 
someone is trying to communi- 
cate, using the colors of the tri-D; 
but I do not see that the sounds to 
which you say these colors cor- 
respond possess any significance.” 
Street leaned back in his chair, 
smiling. “Let us suppose. West- 
ing, that you came in late as it 
were, to the message. Catching the 
last sound of a repeated word, you 
supposed it to be the first. In 
short — ” 

“I see!” I exclaimed, leaping up. 
“ ‘HELP!’ ” 

“Precisely.” 

“But—” 

“There’s no more time to waste. 
Westing. I have only given this 
much explanation because I want 
you to be an intelligent witness to 
what I am about to do. You will 
observe that I have set up a tri-D 
camera before our viewing area, 
enabling me to record for my own 
use any image appearing there.” 
“Yes, you said something about 
that to Commissioner Electric.” 
“So I did. What I intend to do 
now is to code that store near the 
hiring hall and ask for a demon- 
stration. At this late hour it seems 
improbable that anyone will be 
there but a robot clerk — and it’s 
unlikely he will be implicated.” 



S TREET was pushing the coding 
buttons as he spoke and a 
clerk — a robot — appeared almost 
before he had finished the last 
word. 

“I should prefer to deal with a 
human being,” Street told him, 
displaying an excellent imitation of 
prejudice. 

The clerk groveled. “Oh, I am 
sorry, sir. But my employers — and 
no person ever had better — have 
gone to snatch a few hours of de- 
served rest. If you would — ” 

“That’s all right.” Street cut him 
off. “You’ll do. I’m interested in 
another tri-D and I want a demon- 
stration.” 

“Very wise, sir. We have — ” 

“As it happens, I was passing 
your shop today and the set in your 
window looked attractive. I 
presume there would be a dis- 
count, since it’s a demonstrator?” 

“I would have to consult my 
masters,” the clerk answered 
smoothly, “but I assume some- 
thing might be arranged.” 

“Good.” 

“Is there any particular pro- 
gram — ” 

“I don’t know what’s on right 
now.” For an instant Street feigned 
indicision. “Isn’t The Answer Man 
always available?” 

“Indeed he is, sir. Personal, Sex- 
ual, Scholarly, or Civil Affairs?” 
“Civil Affairs, I think.” 

In an instant The Answer Man, 
a computer-generated illusion de- 
signed to give maximum reassur- 



80 



IF 




ance in the field' of civil affairs, ap- 
peared in the tri-D area. 

He nodded politely to us and 
asked, “Would you like a general 
report — or have you specific 
fears?” 

“I have heard rumors,” Street 
said, ‘‘to the effect — well, the fact 
is that an old family servitor of 
mine is — uh — resting in the hiring 
hall. Is it quite safe?” 

The Answer Man reassured him, 
but as he did so he (and indeed the 
entire illusion) blushed a series of 
colors as astonishing as it was — at 
least by me — unexpected. 

“Names,” Street prompted soft- 
ly. “I must have names.” 

“I beg your pardon?” The An- 
swer Man said, but as he spoke he 
coruscated anew with dazzling 
chromatic aberrations. 

“I meant,” Street returned easi- 
ly, “that you would have to have 
my servant’s name before you 
could properly reassure me. But it’s 
really not necessary. I’ve heard — ” 
Abruptly The Answer Man van- 
ished, replaced by the clerk robot. 

“I’m terribly sorry,” he said. 
“Something seems to be wrong 
with the color control. Could 'I 
show you another set?” 

“Oh, no,” Street told him. “The 
trouble is in the network signal. 
Didn’t you get the announcement? 
Sunspots.” 

“Really?” The clerk looked re- 
lieved. “It’s extraordinary that I 
should have missed it.” 

“I would say,” Street sounded 



severe, “that in your position it was 
your duty to have heard it.” 

“I can’t imagine — About an 
hour ago, could it have been? I had 
to leave — only momentarily — to 
dispose of the surplus water cre- 
ated by my fuel cells, but except for 
that—” 

“No doubt that was it,” Street 
said. “I wish you a good evening, 
sir.” He switched off the tri-D. 
“Westing, I’ve done it! I’ve got 
everything we need here.” 

“You mean that by going over 
the tapes you made and compar- 
ing them with your chart — ” 

“No, no, of course not,” Street 
interrupted me testily. “I memo- 
rized the chart while you were 
asleep. The tapes are only for evi- 
dence.” 

“You mean that you under- 
stood — ” 

“Certainly. As well as I under- 
stand you now — though I must 
confess that before I heard that 
poor machine speak it had never 
occurred to me that the word 
dread, especially when given the 
slightly pre-Raphaelite pronunci- 
ation of our unfortunate friend, 
could result in such startling beau- 
ty.” 

“Street,” I said, “you’re toying 
with me. With whom are you com- 
municating when you talk to those 
colors? And how were the deacti- 
vated robots stolen — and why?” 

S TREET smiled, fingering a 
small, cast iron “greedy-pig”

coin bank he had picked up from 
the table beside his chair. “I am 
communicating, as I should think 
must be obvious, with one of the 
stolen robots. And the method of 
theft was by no means difficult — 
indeed. I’m surprised that it is not 
emplpyed more often. A confeder- 
ate of the thieves concealed himself 
in the immensities of the hiring hall 
during the day. When all were gone 
he momentarily interrupted the 
flow of current to one of the 
expanders, with the result that the 
expander space returned to a po- 
sition between the galaxies, carry- 
ing its contents with it. As you 
know, the exact portion of space 
taken by an expander is dependent 
on the fourth derivative of the sinu- 
soidal voltage at the instant of 
startup, so it is most improbable 
that, upon being restarted a split 
second later, the expander should 
return the robots to their proper 
places. They are picked up instead 
by a deep-space freighter and 
eventually returned to Earth. The 
recording ammeter I contrived to 
fasten to the hall’s main power 
supply while Electric was showing 
us around will tell us if anyone tries 
the little trick again, as well as 
convincing a court that might not 
otherwise belive my explanation.” 
“But the colors. Street? Are you 
trying to tell me that the National 
Broadcasting Authority itself is 
employing slave labor?” 

“Not at all.” Street looked 
grave, then smiled— I might al- 



most say grinned — at me. “The 
robots in the hiring hall are there 
because society can find no pres- 
ent use for them — but has it never 
occured to you that the electronics 
they contain might themselves be 
useful?” 

“You mean — ” 

Street nodded. “I do. A tri-D set 
requires considerable computing 
power: a quite complicated signal 
must be unscrambled almost in- 
stantly to produce the three-di- 
mensional illusion. The central 
processing unit of a robot, how- 
ever, would be more than equal to 
the task — and very economical, if 
it were free. Unfortunately — for 
them — the criminals made one 
mistake. A criminal always makes 
one mistake. Westing.” 

“They wired the speech centers 
to handle the color coding?” 
“Precisely. 1 am proud of you.” 

I was so elated that I leaped to 
my feet and for a few moments 
paced the room feverishly. The tri- 
umph of justice — the chagrin of the 
criminal manufacturers! The glory 
that would be Street’s and, to some 
degree as his friend, mine! At 
length a new thought struck me, 
coming with the clarity of the 
tolling of a great bell. 

“Street — ” I said. 

“You look dashed, Westing.” 
“You have done society a great 
service.” 

“I know it — and the fee will be 
most useful. There is an early 
twentieth-century iron-claw ma-

chine in a junk shop over on four 
hundred and forty-fourth I've been 
lusting after. It needs a little 
work — the claw won’t pick up 
anything now— but I think I can fix 
it." 

“Street, it might be possible— 
Commissioner Electric possesses 
great influence — " 

"What are you blathering about. 
Westing?" 

"It might be possible for you to 
be reclassed. Have your birthright 
income restored." 

"Are you insinuating. Westing, 
that you believe me to have been 
declassed for criminal activity?" 

"But all human beings are born 
classed — and you’re not old 
enough to have refused death." 

"Believe me. Westing, my in- 
come is still in existence and— in a 
way — I am receiving it. You, as a 
bio-mechanic, should understand." 

"You mean—’’ 



"Yes. I have had a child by asex- 
ual reproduction. A child who du- 
plicates precisely my own genetic 
makeup — a second self. The law, 
as you no doubt know, requires in 
such cases that the parent’s in- 
come go to the child. He must be 
reared and educated." 

"You could have married." 

"I prefer to have a home. And 
no man has a home unless he is 
master of a place where he must 
please no one — a place where he 
can go and lock the door behind 
him." 

This was what I had feared. I 
said, "In that case perhaps you 
won’t want — I mean, with the 
money you’ll be getting from Elec- 
tric you won’t need to share this 
apartment. I would quite under- 
stand, Street, really I would." 

"You, Westing?’’ Street 
laughed. "You’re no more in the 
way than a refrigerator." •

His enemy was so like himself that 
not even death would tell them apart . 



GREG BENFORD and DONALD FRANSON

I 

T HE skater lifted abruptly off 
the ramp, caught the wind and 
slid sideways toward the water. In 
a moment it was rocking and 
bouncing above the waves, build- 
ing up to its top speed of two hun- 
dred miles an hour. Jim Forrest 
was thankful for the autopilot — no 
human pilot could handle the skat- 
er in this weather. 

Behind him the buildings of 
Mark Station vanished into the 
gray rain and the island's dark bulk 
disappeared in a few seconds more. 
Forrest was driving by dead 
reckoning, with no need to use a 
map, as there was only one other 
island on Marconi, the ocean-cov- 
ered planet of Denebola. ~ 

To say that the sea was choppy 
would be an extreme understate- 
ment. The wind pounded, the rain 
poured on the windshield of the 
little craft and the clouds turned 
early afternoon into night as the 
jet-cushion craft skimmed just 
above the water, underjets echoing 
the roaring storm. The autopilot 
chattered as it computed the height 
of the oncoming waves, increasing 
or decreasing the pressure of the jet 
pillar beneath. 

Too close , thought Forrest as he 
set the altitude level to fifty feet. 
This would take more power, but 
he didn’t want to plow through any 
crests. Forty-foot waves! He’d 
never seen them before on Mar- 
coni. There had never been such a 



storm in the planet’s short history 
— and he had to be out in it. 

It was B.H.’s fault, he thought. 
He should have expected some- 
thing like this and gotten Harrison 
off the isolated outpost before now. 
Three men on a planet should stick 
together, especially now since there 
might be others around. He peered 
out into the gloom, trying to 
imagine where he could not see. 
Where in all that watery vastness 
could the alien capsule have land- 
ed? 

If it had been a capsule. The 
automatic recording satellite had 
only told them that something had 
entered the atmosphere and the dis- 
tant guard ship had warned them of 
a Dent starship in the vicinity. But 
it didn’t take a computer to put two 
and two together. 

Forrest had known nothing 
about any of it until that morning, 
when Commander Howard had 
called him in. “You can put down 
your comic book, Jim. I’ve got a 
job for you,” Howard had said, re- 
clining on his bunk in the control 
office while the automatic ma- 
chinery around him ran the busy 
communications station. 

Slouching semi-respect fully 
within the door, Forrest had pro- 
tested that it was Meyer’s Dia- 
logues he was holding in his hand 
and had added, “I’ve been 
grounded for four days, B.H. There 
isn’t much else to do.” 

The scene recreated itself in de- 
tail in Forrest’s memory .

IF 




B . H. HOWARD sat up, rose 
heavily to his stockinged feet. 
“Don’t take me seriously, Jim. I 
really do appreciate your volun- 
teering to stay on and there hasn’t 
been much to do around here. But 
now there is.” He padded over to 
the message desk. Howard was not 
a military man — the title of Com- 
mander had devolved on him along 
with Director, Station-Master and 
several other offices when the Star- 
dust had left a month ago with the 
rest of the personnel. He cut no fig- 
ure in his wrinkled blue suit — it 
looked as if it had been slept in, as 
it probably had. But he was For- 
rest’s boss and, though they had lit- 
tle in common, they had got on 
well. 

“Here’s a message from Har- 
rison over on the other island,” 
said Howard. “It was sent via the 
stars — Regulus picked it up on the 
gravity beam and relayed it back to 
us. I think I know how he did it — 
hooked onto the planet’s carrier- 
wave. He used to do it for a joke 
until they made him cut it out, 
years ago. I didn’t know that 
equipment was still left at the old 
station. It seems his planet radio 
is out. This is Morse code— he 
could only switch on and off— but 
the translation is below.” 

Forrest took the paper, squinted 
at the markings and the penciled 
letters below them. “ ‘Retransmit 
to Howard, Marconi Station, 
Denebola. Radio out. Require box 
of Contrad at once. You have it in 



medical supplies. Must have some 
in twelve hours. No transportation. 
Sorry. Harrison.’ What’s Con- 
trad?” 

Howard ran a hand over his 
balding forehead. “What do you 
know about Warner Harrison, 
Jim? Not much? Well, I’ll tell 
you.” He stared at the flashing 
lights indicating messages passing 
through from Regulus to Arcturus 
and elsewhere, the light-years 
spanned instantaneously by the 
gravity waves and requiring little 
monitoring here at the booster sta- 
tion. Forrest waited silently while 
Howard collected his thoughts. 

“Harrison was a pretty impor- 
tant man when Marconi Station 
was on Nexus Island, before they 
built this place. When he retired he 
wouldn’t leave the island. He said 
he liked the ocean air on Marconi, 
didn’t think he’d last the long jour- 
ney back to Earth, so they let .him 
stay on at Nexus Island as sort of 
unofficial caretaker. They used to 
have a lot of workers at the old 
station— not like here where every- 
thing’s automatic — and they even 
had a small community on an is- 
land adjoining, maybe a couple 
hundred people. Of course there’s 
no one there now and the installa- 
tion is dismantled, but Harrison 
keeps busy with his astronomy and 
other hobbies. The only thing is — 
well, he was in a space accident 
about twenty years ago — lost his 
wife and family and suffered from 
radiation effects himself. He got a 



STAR CROSSING 



87 




lot of it into his bones — they’ve got 
a cure, for that, only it has to be 
kept up.”. 

“So Contrad is short for contra- 
radiation,” said Forrest. 

“Right. And when he says he 
needs it in twelve hours, he means 
it. If he doesn’t have regular doses 
to suppress the radiation coming 
from his bones damage will be 
done elsewhere — he. probably 
means he’ll die in twelve hours. So 
we’ve got to bring it to him before 
then. I’ve got the stuff, I’m sure — 
he made me store some here. I 
don’t know why he ran out; he al- 
ways kept an ample supply of Con- 
trad. We’re a long way from the 
drug store.” 

Forrest was hardly listening. 
“But how will we get there? Nexus 
is a thousand miles from here. The 
submarine will take twenty hours 
— and that’s the only thing that’ll 
make it in this storm.” 

Howard looked worried. “Don’t 
you think the plane is in condi- 
tion?” 

“The planed Are you crazy? 
Even if I could take off in this mess 
I’d have to land, wouldn’t I? I’d 
have to make two impossible 
landings — or don’t you want me to 
come back?” 

“Take it easy. I was just won- 
dering,” said Howard. 

“Besides,” added Forrest, “The 
plane isn’t in condition. It took a 
lot of beating in that wind before I 
got it under cover.” 

“Take the skater, then. It ought 



to work in a storm if you set the 
jets up high enough — and it can 
make it in about five hours. We’ve 
never used it except in a calm sea, 
but—” 

“It certainly is a wonderful 
thing,” said Forrest sarcastically. 
“They left us all kinds of trans- 
port. Only none of it is any good in 
an emergency.” 

“Well, who could predict a 
storm like this? Marconi’s never 
had one before. I don’t know how 
long it will last and I don’t want to 
wait for it to let up. This is a mis- 
sion of mercy, Jim, and if you don’t 
go, I'll go.” 

Forrest flushed. “I’m the pilot 
around here, B.H. I guess the 
skater will make it. Find the med- 
icine and I’m on my way.” 

“Thanks,” said Howard. “I wish 
I could just shoot it there. I could 
probably come close to the island 
with a missile, but he wouldn’t have 
the ability to retrieve it. Besides, 
there’s something else. Something 
I haven’t told you.” 

That was when he mentioned the 
Dents. “I don’t have continuous 
contact with the guard ship. They 
can’t use gravity waves, so they 
have to signal by radio or light and 
they were about two light-days out 
then. That was three Marconi-days 
ago — I just got the message this 
morning. I don’t know where they 
are now — probably chasing the 
Dent starship.” 

“But this is fantastic,” said For- 
rest. “One lousy guard ship for the 



88 



IF 




communications hub of the stellar 
empire!” 

Commander Howard frowned. 
“Why isn’t this place better guard- 
ed? Because the Dents are normal- 
ly peaceful. Too many of our guard 
ships in the heart of someone 
else’s territory could cause trouble. 
This station can take care of itself, 
don’t worry. No one can get within 
a hundred miles of this island, on, 
above, or under the surface. Or 
from space either. A free-falling 
missile, or any missile sent here, 
would be detected and destroyed 
without hurting us.” 

“But can one man handle all the 
defenses?” 

“They’re computer-run. One 
man here is just as tough as an 
army. Otherwise they wouldn’t 
leave this station with minimum 
personnel. The station and base 
could even be completely auto- 
matic, but that’s a little too dan- 
gerous. If Regulus or Arcturus 
could operate this station by re- 
mote control, so could anyone else 
with the right equipment. The only 
weak spot is the human element. I 
could let the Dents in — but I won’t. 
You’ll even have to pass a test to 
get back in here, when you return, 
to make sure you’re not a Dent in 
disguise. But don’t worry, this base 
is safe. The robot defenses are al- 
ways on guard. All they need is a 
button-presser. I can push buttons 
in my sleep.” 

“So it isn’t just a mission of 
mercy. You want me to check the 



island and see if there are any 
Dents around.” 

“The satellite recorded the entry 
about the same time the Dent star- 
ship was seen. It’s possible — only 
possible, mind you — that a capsule 
could have landed in the ocean near 
Nexus Island. It certainly didn’t 
land within a hundred miles of 
here, or I would have detected it. 
And blown it out of the water, 
needless to say.” 

“What’ll I do with a Dent if I see 
one?” 

Howard looked as if this had not 
occurred to him. “The skater is 
armed. But try to avoid the Dents, 
if any. Just get the Contrad to Har- 
rison. H’mmm — maybe you’d bet- 
ter take him off. Bring him back 
here.” 

“That would be best,” agreed 
Forrest. “If Nexus is undefended it 
would be better not to have anyone 
there. Does he have any specialized 
knowledge they would particularly 
want?” 

“No. He’s been out of the com- 
munications service too long. 
They’d get nothing new out of him. 
They’d get nothing out of the old 
station either — what’s not dis- 
mantled is obsolete. Still, Harris- 
on’s a good man — so bring him 
back. If he doesn’t want to come, 
persuade him.” 

Forrest smirked wryly. “So all I 
have to do is go out in this terrific 
storm, manhandle an untested 
skater a thousand miles, keep a 
sharp lookout for aliens and talk a 



STAR CROSSING 



89 




hermit into coming to town. That’s 
a big order.” 

Howard smiled. 

“You asked for work when you 
came here.” 

“Couldn’t you simplify the de- 
fense problem by shooting a mis- 
sile to blow up the other island? 1 
mean, if Harrison weren’t there.” 

Howard was startled, then 
thoughtful. “Yes, I could. Let me 
know, as soon as you get him off, 
and 1 might just send that missile. 
There’s another little thing I might 
as well tell you. It’s in the balance 
whether they’re going to maintain 
this station, or abandon it. If they 
decide to abandon Marconi — a re- 
lief ship will come to get us out of 
here. So maybe it’s best if Harris- 
on were here with us anyway. Then 
we wouldn’t have to go get him 
when we leave. The space tender is 
ready to lift any time, as soon as 
there’s a starship around to ren- 
dezvous with.” 

The older man padded over to 
the stellar sphere, the three-dimen- 
sional globular chart of the stellar 
empire, three feet (or three hun- 
dred light-years) across. He poked 
a pencil through it. “Here’s Dene- 
bola . Arcturus . Regulus . 
Sun. Shiplines are white, gravity 
lines red. If Denebola is taken out 
they’ll have to reroute the Sun- 
Regulus channel through Pollux, 
here. That’ll be expensive. It’ll re- 
quire an additional booster some- 
where farther along the route. 
We’re forty-three from Sun here. 



fifty from Regulus, not far from a 
straight line between the two. 
We’re on an exact straight line be- 
tween Arcturus and Regulus. De- 
touring there will add a lot of light- 
years, but they’re thinking of doing 
it. That’s how desperate they are.” 

“Well, we’re not going to aban- 
don Denebola, are we?” 

“It’s not what we do. It’s what 
the Dents do. They’re all around 
us. If you remember your Earth 
history, we’re about in the position 
of the American island of Guam in 
the midst of the Japanese Man- 
date. We’re surrounded by Dent- 
occupied stars.” 

Though Forrest knew Howard 
had made a study of famous wars 
and battles, it always surprised him 
to hear this non-bookish man say 
something like this. He looked 
through the window at the raging 
storm, then at the TV picture sent 
by the satellite, showing endless 
cloud cover. 

“It reminds me of another bat- 
tle, too, in that same war,” he said. 
“The Battle of the Bulge.” 

Howard nodded. “Exactly. This 
storm is making it easy for the 
enemy. You might almost think 
they are making the storm.” 

“I wouldn’t put it past them,” 
said Forrest. “Under cover of a 
storm — a planet-wide storm — they 
could land a capsule almost with- 
out detection. But — so what? 
What’s so dangerous about a cou- 
ple of lousy Dents landing in a cap- 
sule?” 



90 



IF 




W HA TS so dangerous? he had 
asked. The dark, onrushing 
waves were now higher and it 
looked like the storm would keep 
up all the way to the island. He ad- 
justed the skater’s clearance a 
notch and leaned back in the seat, 
tired from the vibration and noise 
of the engines and from the storm 
just outside the windows. At one 
time the Dents didn’t seem danger- 
ous, though he had never liked 
them himself. Once they could only 
imitate men imperfectly. Howard 
had tried to downgrade their 
powers but he had not been con- 
vincing. 

“They can’t read minds,” he had 
said. “So their imitations are only 
from observation. They can only 
imitate specific individuals — ones 
they’ve got some personal data on. 
And get it out of your head that 
they replace people— they don’t. 
They only seem to, because occa- 
sionally they have impersonated 
someone after they disposed of the 
original. The Dents were always 
capable of some kind of imitation. 
In the early days of interstellar 
trade, they were caricatures of 
humanoids. You’ve seen the trade- 
form. Now, they’re — better.” 

“Or worse.” 

“There’s nothing to worry 
about. Dents can’t beat humans, in 
a fair fight. They can only infil- 
trate by disguising themselves. And 
we’ve got a sure-fire test to tell 
them from humans.” 

“I’ve heard of that. ‘Dear Dent, 



kindly hold still while I test you.’ It 
certainly — ” 

“Take a pistol.” 

“You don’t really expect me to 
find Dents on the island? What 
about Harrison?” 

“They may have landed there. 
We’ve got to be prepared. As for 
Harrison ...” Howard had made 
a sour face. “Test Harrison , too, 
when you meet him. That’s one 
reason I can’t go. I don’t know 
what I’d do if he failed the test. 
He’s too close a friend. I might be 
slow to shoot.” 

Forrest had hefted the pistol 
Howard had given him, a Grennell 
special guard model with mounted 
flashlight. “All right.” He had 
strapped on the holster. 

Howard had said, “I’d better tell 
you the other reason I can’t go. 
You see, in addition to my other 
duties and titles, I’m also the cap- 
tain.” 

Forrest had waited for the ex- 
pected punch line. 

“I’m the captain, who has to go 
down with the ship.” Howard had 
padded over to the gravity beam 
controls, the most imposing array 
in the room. “The gravity waves 
are generated deep in the planet’s 
interior. That’s why these booster 
stations can’t be out in space, 
where you’d think they’d logically 
be. Only a large, solid planet, like 
this one, can generate enough grav- 
ity power to send the beam to the 
stars instantaneously. There’s a lot 
of power locked up in this station. 



STAR GROSSING

“Do you see that button over 
there?” 

Next to a busy seismograph For- 
rest had seen a glass case with a red 
button inside, marked “P.B.” 
“PB.?” 

“Panic Button. Someone has to 
push that as a last resort. It's a 
safety measure to prevent an ene- 
my from taking over the station in 
a surprise attack. All it does is cut 
off a damper that suppresses a sec- 
ondary vibration of the gravity 
waves that can cause an earth- 
quake that will not only destroy the 
station— but will break up the 
planet. Naturally this can’t be safe- 
ly rigged to operate by remote con- 
trol. Someone else might find a 
way to operate it, then.” 

“It certainly is a wonderful 
thing,” Forrest had saidr 

Now he was nearing the island 
and the storm hadn’t let up. It had 
grown darker, as the eight-hour 
night had begun. He tried to con- 
tact Harrison, but no response, as 
expected. Mark Station was long 
out of coptact, the TV shredding 
before a hundred miles had gone 
by. At the last Howard had pressed 
a slip of paper to the facsimile plate 
and Forrest had peeled the copy 
from his own plate. He looked at it 
again. There were several lines in 
B.H.’s barely legible scrawl— a ser- 
ies of questions for him to ask 
Harrison. 

Howard had said that the official 
test was sure-fire. Why, then, the 
additional quiz? 



A HEAD of him a light gleamed 
and suddenly a long, flat- 
topped island grew visible in the 
gloom, plainly artificial and sur- 
rounded by a high sea wall. He saw 
the dome of the observatory to the 
left, circled toward the flare-out- 
lined airfield. At the last moment 
he veered and landed in the water 
just off the skater-ramp, taxied in. 
The violent rocking of the waves 
made him a little sick. He drove 
high up on the ramp and stopped 
the engines. Opening the door 
with difficulty against the wind 
and rain, he got out. He was 
instantly drenched — he had no 
raincoat. The place looked 
deserted, as of course it almost 
was. 

Someone was coming toward 
him from the airfield, running* 
raincoat flapping. Forrest hastily 
took out his Grennell pistol. 

“Stop,’’ he shouted. “Stop 
where you are.” He tensed — what 
would he do if the runner didn't 
stop? Cold chills ran down his 
back. He sneezed. 

The slight figure halted about 
fifty feet from him. 

He flicked on the pistol-mounted 
flashlight and the be,am stabbed 
through the raindrops, fighting up 
a small white face beneath a drip- 
ping rain hat. It was Harrison, 
from his pictures. He was squint- 
ing in the bright fight. He had al- 
ready passed the “blink’’ test. 



92 



IF 




though it was raining too hard to 
be certain. 

“Is that B.H.?” called Harrison 
in a weak voice. 

“No, I’m Howard’s pilot, Jim 
Forrest.” He held the light steady. 

“Did you bring the Contrad?” 
The voice was even weaker. 

“Yes. I have a little test for you. 
Close your eyes, stand still and say 
nothing for one minute after I give 
the signal, ‘time.’ ” This was the 
fabulous “elapsed time test” that 
Earth’s scientists had devised to tell 
Dents from humans. 

Harrison protested mildly, “It’s 
raining — ” but obediently closed 
his eyes. 

I know , thought Forrest. He was 
much wetter than Harrison, who at 
least had a raincoat. “When I say 
‘time’ you start counting, or 
whatever you want to do, until one 
minute — one standard stellar min- 
ute — is up. Then say so.” The 
Dents had no innate sense of time, 
perhaps because they were said to 
have no hearts. 

“Time.” Forrest looked at his 
wristwatch, tried to make sure that 
the other man wasn’t looking at 
his. This was not the most favor- 
able condition for conducting any 
test. The rain came down harder. 

“The minute’s up,” said Har- 
rison at last. 

Forrest looked at his watch: 55 
seconds. That was close enough. 
It’s human to judge time too fast 
by a little. If it had been exactly 
sixty seconds he might even have 



been a little suspicious. He kept the 
light on the shining face. 

“Can we go in now? Let’s go in,” 
Harrison was pleading. 

“Just a minute.” Forrest pulled 
a slip of paper out of his pocket. It 
was soaked, nearly falling apart. 
Well, he could remember the ques- 
tions B.H. had written down. 

Chilled to the bone, Forrest kept 
the Grennell pointed. The figure 
seemed to sway. The paper had 
now disintegrated in the rain, 
“Okay. One , said Forrest, clearly. 
‘‘When you and Howard were 
working together at the old 
station, what was your private 
nickname for him?” 

“Shoeless,” said Harrison. 

All right so far , thought Forrest. 
But that was fairly easy. 

“Two. There was a golf game on 
Nexus Island the last time How- 
ard was there. Who else was in the 
foursome?” 

“Uh — Howard’s wife and Lieu- 
tenant Betty Kay of the Transpor- 
tation Corps. Can we go in now?” 
The wind began blowing in gusts, 
driving the rain crazily around 
them. 

“One more,” said Forrest mis- 
erably. He stopped to sneeze. 
“ Three . There was a Christmas 
party fourteen years ago in the 
Nexus Hotel. Besides you and 
Howard, what other people were 
there?” 

Silence. Then, weak but strong- 
er than before, “You can tell B.H. 
to go to Antares and take up an 



STAR CROSSING 



93 




orbit within the perimeter. How the 
hell should I know?” The last 
words were barely audible. 

Forrest heaved a sigh of relief. 
That was the right answer . Few 
people could remember such de- 
tails; but a disguised Dent, notori- 
ous for overacting, was expected to 
try. He put his pistol away and 
walked toward Harrison in the 
dark. 

He almost panicked when he 
didn’t find him, then he saw a 
crumpled form at his feet. Harri- 
son had fainted. 

Forrest felt like kicking himself. 
He had forgotten that Harrison 
was in a weakened condition, 
might even be dying. It was an 
instant’s work to lift him and carry 
him up the ramp arid into the 
building; the door was unlocked. 

This was apparently Harrison’s 
living quarters. Forrest laid the un- 
conscious man down on a couch, 
then ran out again to the skater and 
brought in the box of medicine. 
Closing the door, he took off his 
soggy collar-shawl. It was cozy in 
here, but he was soaked. 

Harrison seemed to be in a bad 
way, breathing heavily. Forrest did 
what he could to make him com- 
fortable, removing his wet outer 
clothing and covering him with a 
blanket. Then he administered the 
Contrad, an injection into the arm, 
as well as several other medica- 
tions prescribed in the emergency 
instructions on the box. Harrison 
responded rapidly and soon was 



relaxing in a deep sleep. Forrest 
tried to relax, too, began looking 
for a place to dry his clothes. 



A COUPLE of hours and a 
short nap later Forrest felt 
somewhat refreshed, but he mar- 
veled at Harrison’s quick recovery. 
He watched the older man eat 
heartily of bacon and eggs across 
the table. Harrison now wore a 
casual outfit of clashing striped 
colors, contrasting with Forrest's 
tasteful greens and browns, hang- 
ing behind him to dry. 

“You’ve got a varied cuisine 
here for an abandoned outpost 
forty-three light-years from San 
Francisco,” said Forrest, toying 
with the remains of his steak. 

“I stocked up,” said Harrison 
with a broad, toothy smile. “They 
told me I could have any supplies 
still left on the base when the com- 
munications personnel left and — ” 
“How did you run out of Con- 
trad, then?” interrupted Forrest, 
getting up from the table. His 
clothes were dry, so he took them 
off the hangers. 

Harrison looked embarrassed. 
“That was my fool mistake. I 
thought I had enough. I counted 
the empty boxes.” 

He would say no more about it 
and Forrest changed the subject. 
He was beginning to like the little 
man, though he had known him for 
only a few hours. Forrest slipped 
on his cigar-brown shirt, stepped 



94 



IF 




into his leaf-green slacks and 
joined them deftly. He was curious 
about another thing. 

“How did you manage to hook 
onto the gravity beam?” he asked, 
pulling on his brown bootsox. 

“Oh, that.” Harrison grinned. “I 
still had the old rig I used before. 
Burned it out, though, finally. 
Lucky I got through with what I 
sent. I assume I did — you’re here.” 

“ ‘ Strange , that one learns of 
one's own house front the distant 
stars.' " Forrest threw his dark- 
green collar-shawl around his 
shoulders and snapped the button 
in front. 

“What’s that, a quotation?” 
asked Harrison, spooning Arctur- 
an peaches. 

Forrest nodded. “The seven- 
teenth-century playwright, Charles 
Burbee.” He looked around at the 
homey little room. He realized that 
Harrison was happy here — yet 
Forrest had to get him off. He 
brought up the subject of the Dent 
capsule. 

“All we know is that it entered 
the atmosphere — we don’t know 
exactly where. .If they’d landed 
within a hundred miles of Mark, 
we would have had them. If they’d 
landed in clear weather anywhere 
on Marconi we could have picked 
them up without any difficulty. But 
this storm — ” 

Harrison stopped eating, looked 
up in surprise. “Then that’s what it 
was I heard about three or four 
nights ago — a whistling roar woke 



me up. I thought it was a funny 
sound for thunder.” 

“Then they might have landed in 
the ocean somewhere within a few 
miles of here,” said Forrest. The 
feeling of peace left him and 
nervousness replaced it. He picked 
up the heavy holster and strapped it 
on. 

“Well, I haven’t seen them,” 
said Harrison. “They ought to have 
shown up by now. Maybe they 
crashed in the ocean.” He seemed 
to be taking the matter calmly, 
went back to his coffee. “I was 
wondering about the lodge ritual 
last night.” 

“Howard thought they might 
have already landed on this island. 
That’s why he told me to test you. 
How big is this station? It’s bigger 
than the new one, isn’t it?” 

“No, it’s smaller. That is, the 
station itself. Nexus City covers a 
larger area on its own island.” 
“Well, couldn’t an alien have put 
ashore somewhere without you 
knowing about it?” 

“I doubt it,” said Harrison. 
“But we’ll just take a look.” He got 
up, turned toward the stairs. “The 
observatory’s just above.” 



T HE little man mounted a cir- 
cular staircase, pressed a but- 
ton on the bannister and the stairs 
started moving upward. Forrest 
got on behind and below him. Har- 
rison turned and smiled down 
crookedly.

44 Ever see a circular moving 
stairway?” 

Forrest had to admit that he 
hadn't. This station, though 
smaller than Mark, was built for a 
large staff of technicians. He 
wondered how many men had once 
used this stairway back in the Old 
Nexus days. 

On the second floor they walked 
past the open door of a large room 
whose appointments looked famil- 
iar to him. Of course — this was the 
communications control room. 
Quaintly different from Com- 
mander Howard’s, it was fitted 
with fewer computing-machine 
stands and more desks and chairs. 

44 Many of the functions were 
manual here,” explained Harrison 
superfluously. “It would take a 
dozen men to operate the gravity 
beams alone. All 1 could do was 
jury-rig some surplus apparatus to 
get a simple message out, the old 
on-off code, hooked onto the New 
Nexus beam to Regulus. That’s the 
wreck over there.” He pointed to a 
Rube-Goldbergian contraption 
bristling with wires and levers, 
scorched black and covered with 
fire-extinguisher foam. 44 1 often 
talked with Howard via Arcturus 
— or Regulus or the Sun— after he 
moved over to New Nexus — I 
mean Mark — until they traced the 
astronomical expense involved and 
made us stop it.” He chuckled. 
44 There’s nothing much else to in- 
terest you here unless you can do 
something to fix the planet radio.” 



4 Tm a pilot, not a communi- 
cations expert,” said Forrest. 

Harrison said, “It probably 
wouldn’t work in this storm 
anyway. And the mast is down, 
too.” 

Harrison stepped up to another 
set of stairs, clicked it on. 

Forrest noticed another door as 
he passed it. It was closed. 

44 That’s the storeroom,” said _ 
Harrison, moving upward. “By the 
way, that box of Contrad you 
brought me ought to last me for six 
months. The Stardust ought to be 
back by then with my order.” 

He vanished around the stairs. 

Forrest wondered darkly if the 
Stardust would ever be back. He 
stared at the closed door of the 
storeroom, thinking of something 
else. Harrison reappeared, tread- 
ing backward, waved at him impa- 
tiently. 

“Come on up to the observa- 
tory.” 

Forrest got on the moving stairs 
with a sigh, walked up two at a 
time and soon caught up to Har- 
rison. 

They rose into a blue-lighted 
room. It was daylight. Not the 
brightness of a clear day but the 
blue-gray of an overcast dawn. 

There were windows on all sides 
of the spacious observatory room. 
Forrest was delighted by the view 
of the tossing gray sea and went to 
the nearest window, where he felt 
the breeze of fresh ocean air from a 
small, indirect opening. The rain

IF 




had let up a little and he could see 
for almost a mile, though not to the 
horizon, where dark clouds lin- 
gered. The high sea wall of the 
artificial island was close below 
him, except on one side where the 
jumbled building of Old Nexus 
City stretched away for several 
blocks, its roofs and streets glisten- 
ing with rain, still falling lightly. 
Forrest looked at his Arcturus- 
made, Marconi-set watch. It was 
just five o’clock, near the beginning 
of the eight-hour day. A thousand 
miles from Mark Station, along 
the equator, would mean a dif- 
ference in time of about an hour, 
not worth bothering with, so the 
two islands kept the same time. 

Maybe the storm would clear up, 
Forrest thought. This waterbound 
planet didn’t have much stormy 
weather, being nearly seasonless, 
so far out from the giant star 
Denebola that its orbital year could 
be measured in centuries. If it 
weren’t for the presence of the alien 
Dents in nearby systems, Marconi 
would be a good place to live, as 
well as a communications link. 
But no one had wanted an ocean- 
covered world for colonization — 
with so many others available — 
and the few and tiny other planets 
of Denebola were unattractive. 
Now the Regulus region, fifty 
light-years farther out, was the 
new heart of empire, with hundreds 
of better planets than this. He’d 
have to go there some day. Fifty 
light-years were not too many. 



T HE voice of Harrison roused 
him from his reverie. “You 
didn’t notice my telescope.” 

There it stood, hardly to be 
missed in the center of the room — 
an optical refractor that was ob- 
viously not the instrument of a 
professional astronomer but that of 
an enthusiastic amateur. It pointed 
upward through a section of the 
dome, now closed. 

Harrison started its motor, 
swiveled it, spun it in a circle, 
pointed out its features and 
generally displayed it proudly. “I 
could show you the Sun, even in the 
daytime, if it weren’t for this 
damn rainstorm. I haven’t been 
able to use this telescope for 
days.” 

He shut off the instrument, 
wiped it with a cloth and turned 
back to Forrest. 

The amateur astronomer was in 
his element. “Have you ever seen 
the Sun from here? It’s a fifth-mag- 
nitude star. The nearest bright star 
to it is Beta Ceti, third magnitude. 
Rather an empty region of space. 
The Sun is just within the borders 
of the old constellation of 
Aquarius; They used to have a 
saying that when the Sun is in 
Aquarius — the Water Bearer — 
there’ll be lots of rain.” He flashed 
a broad grin. “Here it’s always in 
Aquarius, so — ” 

“I see you have a stellar sphere, 
too,” remarked Forrest, ignoring 
the joke. It was a globe smaller, 
older than the one back at Mark 



STAR CROSSING

Station. And it had fewer white 
and red lines. 

‘*1 brought it up here from the 
control room," said Harrison. “I 
use it for a star chart once in a 
while, though it’s not up to date.” 

“It’s an antique,” said Forrest. 
“The sphere is only two hundred 
light-years in diameter.” There 
weren't any aliens around here 
then , thought Forrest. Now the 
Dents were all around, menacing 
the link with Regulus, as well as 
Denebola itself. Twisting the 
Lion’s tail. 

No one knew where the Dents 
had originally come from. They 
had always been seen in their gray, 
featureless trade-forms, their 
sketchy arms, legs and* head paro- 
dying the humans and humanoids 
they traded with. It was thought 
that their original form was more 
horrible and not at all humanoid. 
The Dents kept this a closely 
guarded secret— without claiming 
the trade-forms were their own. 
Now they were actually imitating 
humans and getting good at it. 

The reason for the war at pres- 
ent was this very possibility of in- 
filtration through impersonation. 
Earlier the Dents had been figures 
of fun with their crude imitations 
and dressed in ridiculous clothes. 
Now they were not so funny. 

Harrison was explaining some- 
thing about the workings of grav- 
ity beams, but Forrest could not 
pay attention to the technical stuff. 
His mind was otherwise occupied. 



Why were he and Harrison wasting 
time when they ought to be looking 
for the Dent capsule? Or better, 
making tracks in the skater back to 
Mark Station? But first he had to 
persuade Harrison to go. He 
seemed to be contented here. 
Forrest didn’t blame him; it was a 
nice place — if it weren’t for the 
Dents. 

“ — dependent on space itself,” 
Harrison was saying. “That’s why 
it’s instantaneous anywhere in the 
stellar sphere, even across the gal- 
axy, if we had boosting stations. To 
the Andromeda Nebula in a tenth 
of a second.” 

“In a tenth of a second?” said 
Forrest, surprised out of his si- 
lence. “I thought it was instantan- 
eous all over.” 

Harrison flashed his toothy 
smile. “Not completely. For all 
practical purposes. At intra-galac- 
tic distances. Even gravity waves 
have their limitations.” 

Forrest said, “If we could only 
hook up ships to that beam we 
could cross the galaxy in no time.” 
“Why should we?” said Harris- 
on. “We couldn’t explore it all in a 
million years. Leave some of it to 
other races.” 

This brought Forrest back to the 
present, down to Marconi. “What 
do you know about the Dents?” 
“The Identities? Not much, 
really. They are an industrious 
race, they are almost humanoid — 
at least in their trade forms.” 
“Have you ever seen one?” 



98 



IF 




“No,” said Harrison. “They’ve 
never actually landed on Marconi 
— although they have made some 
entries into this system in the past. 
Accidentally, mostly. But, outside 
of TV, no.” 

“I have,” said Forrest. “A long 
time ago, when I was a kid on Arc- 
turus, one came to Einstein with a 
circus or something. He was a 
gray, greasy, rubber-doll-like little 
bastard — when he wasn’t trying to 
disguise himself as a human.” 

“You know that even that isn’t 
the Identities’ true shape,” said 
Harrison. “They assumed it only to 
trade with humanoid races.” 

“Blech,” said Forrest. “I don’t 
think I want to see the real Identi- 
ties.” 

“Why, you’re prejudiced.” Har- 
rison grinned. “I didn’t think it of 
you. I suppose we must all put on 
our prejudices — along with our 
uniforms — now that war is, im- 
pending.” 

“You’re an idiot,” said Forrest 
softly. 



Ill 

H E RETURNED to the ob- 
servatory windows. Harrison 
handed him a pair of 7 x 50 binoc- 
ulars and he scanned the horizon, 
less visible now than ever, though 
the day was further advanced. 
Dark clouds obscured the sea, hung 
closer in than before. He turned to 
examine the shoreline of the island. 



Down below him the skater 
ramp was awash with bouncing 
rain. The skater itself sat solidly 
there, a bit of familiar security. 
The adjoining airfield was empty. 
Scanning farther, Forrest gave a 
grunt of surprise. 

“What’s that sticking out of the 
water there?” He indicated the sea 
just below the airport, where what 
looked like a bundle of rods broke 
the water. 

“That’s the copter,” said Har- 
rison. “The storm wrecked it the 
first blow, knocked it down there 
from the field. So, no transporta- 
tion. As if I could fly in this storm 
anyway.” 

Forrest continued searching the 
base of the island — the submarine 
landing, the isthmus bridge to Nex- 
us City, the skater ramp again. He 
wondered what had been in- 
creasingly bothering him — now he 
knew. There was no protection 
here. No armament. The place was 
wide open. He mentioned this to 
Harrison. 

The little man pointed to a bal- 
cony, where a small variable-fire- 
power cannon was mounted. Then 
he showed the tiny pistol inside his 
shirt. Harrison looked too smug 
even to be laughable. Was this all 
he had? Forrest could easily defeat 
this puny weaponry with nothing 
but the skater’s own armament. 

He turned away and, impelled by 
a new sense of urgency, strained his 
eyes in the fading light toward the 
buildings of Old Nexus City. He 



STAR CROSSING 



99 




looked at his watch. It was about 
six o’clock, still two hours short of 
noon, but it was getting dark. That 
meant another storm was blowing 
up. Beyond the bridge he could 
barely make out the open square, 
flanked by what looked like a 
theater and shops. He wondered 
what Old Nexus City was like. 

“You want to see Nexus City? 
Let’s go, then,” said Harrison, 
seeming to read his mind. 

“I don’t think we have time for 
any sight-seeing tours,” snapped 
Forrest. “I’d like to get the skater 
off the ramp and on its way before 
another storm hits. And you — 
you’re going with me.” 

“In the skater? What for?” 

“You can’t stay here.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because — oh, hell, you don’t 
see it, do you? You have no de- 
fenses. You don’t even have any de- 
tectors.” 

“Yes, I have,” said Harrison. 
“They’re all over the island. They 
just haven’t shown anything so far. 
Metal detectors, radiation de- 
tectors, motor detectors, all 
kinds. I was ready for you last 
night, wasn’t I? I’m not defense- 
less.” Harrison calmed down, 
looked unhappy. “But you better 
go ahead, before the storm prevents 
your departure.” 

“You’re coming along,” said 
Forrest. Then he sighed, admit- 
ting temporary defeat. “All 
right. Tell me about Old Nexus 
City.” He’d wait his chance to use 



force. He’d have to watch out for 
the pistol now. 

Harrison’s face relaxed. “Nexus 
means ‘link.’ Fancy guys in those 
days. Now this isn’t the only inter- 
stellar link any more. When they 
opened the new station they just 
called it Marconi— or Mark. 
Everyone left here when Nexus 
closed, so the city is vacant. I guess 
the Stardust took off most of 
Mark’s personnel too, didn’t it? Is 
Howard the only one left there?” 
“Yes,” said Forrest. “Except 
me. And I’m not there. That’s an- 
other reason I want to get back.” 
“I’m sure B.H. can take care of 
himself.” 

You dont know the half of it , 
thought Forrest. He had better 
not mention the missiles Howard 
had trained on this island or Har- 
rison would never agree to leave. 
Another thought occurred to 
him. He wondered how long How- 
ard would wait without hearing 
from him before launching the 
missiles anyway. 

Forrest raised the binoculars 
again, gave up. Outside was too 
dark and the rain too heavy. “I’m 
suspicious about that ghost town.” 
“It’s not a ghost town. I use 
some of it; it stays in good shape. 
Nexus City had everything, still 
has a lot. Let’s go down there and 
I’ll show it to you.” 

Forrest didn’t like the waste of 
time involved, but he agreed be- 
cause he wanted to see if there were 
any traces of the aliens’ landing 



100 



IF 




there. He wasn’t supposed to 
tangle with the Dents but . 



H E STARTED for the stair- 
way but Harrison led the way 
to a door opposite the stairs. Be- 
hind the door was a large closet. In 
it were two little cars, like minia- 
ture railway cars. Harrison got 
into the front one and motioned 
Forrest to climb into the other. He 
did so, thinking this was some kind 
of fast, tobogganlike elevator to 
the control room and living quart- 
ers below. It was a tight fit but he 
made it. 

“I took this from the amuse- 
ment park,” said Harrison, mov- 
ing levers. Another door opened in 
front of them and a blast of cold, 
wet air hit their faces. “Hang on.’’ 
The cars jerked forward and 
down, out into the dark, and the 
bottom dropped out from under 
Forrest’s midsection. Driving 
rain hit him like a waterfall. He 
saw for an instant a dark, yawn- 
ing pit and, with a roar that drown- 
ed out Forrest’s cries, the vehicles 
rolled down the side of the ob- 
servatory tower, flashed out over 
the bridge, coasted across the old 
market place, braked to a slow 
rolling glide. It was all over in sec- 
onds. The cars stopped and Harri- 
son hopped out. Forrest climbed 
out more slowly, shaking. It was 
raining heavily and he was getting 
soaked again. 

So this was Old Nexus City. He 



could hardly see the surrounding 
buildings. Harrison was hurrying 
into a store and Forrest followed, 
sloshing across the square. 

“What’s in here?’’ he asked 
hoarsely when he had gotten in- 
side. 

“Raincoats,’’ said Harrison, 
taking them off the shelves. 

They walked through the store, 
carrying their new raincoats. All 
the merchandise was new but 
seemed ten or more years out of 
date, which of course it was. 

“Take anything you want,’’ in- 
vited Harrison, but Forrest was 
preoccupied. 

He could understand Harrison’s 
reluctance to leave this island. 
He had everything he wanted here. 
For a retired man it was a nice lit- 
tle place. It was too bad Howard 
was going to destroy it soon. This 
was a nice little planet , too. Was 
Howard going to have to destroy 
it also? He wondered uneasily 
what Howard was doing now, 
what he was thinking. 

They walked through an arcade, 
shops on both sides, and entered 
the lobby of the Nexus Hotel. De- 
spite everything that Harrison 
may have done to preserve it the 
lobby did not look quite natural — 
it was empty of people. Neverthe- 
less, it was clean and well-lighted. 
They made their way to the auto- 
matic bar. 

They sat down at 'a table and 
Harrison ordered — punched but- 
tons — for both. Forrest made a 



STAR CROSSING 



101 




decision. Harrison was likely to 
stall here all day. Forrest still had 
not convinced him of the necessity 
of leaving the island. He needed 
shock treatment. 



6iJ M WORRIED;’ Forrest be- 
Agan.“B.H. gave orders to take 
you back with me. He also said to 
let him know as soon as we left the 
island, so that he could bomb it. 
Just to make sure that no Dents 
land here he intends to sink the is- 
land with missiles.” 

If Harrison was shaken by this 
information he didn’t show it. 
“After we leave, did you say? Then 
there’s nothing to worry about. 
I’m not leaving.” 

He smiled engagingly. 

Forrest tasted his drink. “He 
also said — ” now was the time to 
stretch the truth a little — “that if 
I didn’t get back in sixteen hours 
he might send the missiles any- 
way.” 

Now Harrison was distrubed. 
He put down his glass. “He 
wouldn’t do that.” 

“Wouldn’t he? He’d as soon do 
that as press the Panic Button.” 
Harrison drank. “Ah, yes. The 
Panic Button. I had forgotten 
that. Well, if he presses that, what 
difference does it make whether 
we’re here or there?” 

“You have just about an hour to 
decide. It’s too late now to stop 
him — it would take four hours just 
to get within radio range in this 



storm — but at least we can get off 
the island.” 

“You’re lying.” Harrison said 
this with such certainty that For- 
rest was startled. “If there were a 
time limit you would have told me 
about it before this.” 

“All right,” said Forrest. “But 
maybe I’m not lying when I say 
that B.H. has a nervous trigger 
finger. You know him better than 
I do. How can we play it safe? By 
contacting him. But to do that we 
have to go back at least part of the 
way.” 

Harrison seemed thoughtful. 
“Maybe you better go back and 
tell him that I’m not leaving the is- 
land. I’ll take my chances on 
B.H.’s nerves.” 

“I’m not going without you,” 
said Forrest. He might have to 
jump Harrison if nothing else 
worked. 

Harrison shrugged. “Okay. I’ll 
show you the rest of the is- 
land — convince you that there are 
no Identities around here.” He 
rose and a check popped up in the 
center of the table. He picked it up 
and said, “This one’s on me.” He 
walked to the cashier’s desk and 
threw the check into a basket that 
already held a large pile of checks. 

Forrest followed Harrison 
through the lobby and to the door, 
donning his raincoat. This was a 
strangely calm reaction to the 
news he had thought would be a 
bombshell. Shouldn’t Harrison 
have tried to hustle him off to tell 



102 



IF 




Howard not to bomb the place? 
Instead, he was stalling. It was al- 
most as if he was trying to prove 
something — that he was reluctant 
to leave but could be argued out 
of it. 

They walked out into the rain, 
sloshed across the mall. The rain 
was still coming down heavily. 
Forrest caught up to Harrison, 
who was striding along in a direc- 
tion away from the observatory 
and toward the far side of Old 
Nexus City. 

“Aren’t you sort of — ’’ 
Overdoing if! Forrest completed 
the sentence to himself. 

Harrison turned, still walking. 
“Sort of what?’’ 

“Sort of blase about it all,” For- 
rest said. “This is a dangerous 
situation. Howard thinks — ” 

“Forrest, I’m not going. You 
can tell B.H. to go circle a nova. 
It’s people like him who create 
situations.” 

“It isn’t just Howard’s opinion. 
I thought — and I still think— that 
the Dents may have come down 
near here. You thought so, too.” 

“I did?” Harrison was going up 
the steps of an imposing building 
marked City Hall. 

“Well, when you said you’d 
heard a sound that might have been 
the capsule coming down.” 

Harrison didn’t answer. They 
entered by a revolving door, came 
into a hall with many side doors. 
Harrison used one and they found 
themselves in a spacious room. 



“This is the council chamber. 
I’r p the mayor.” Harrison picked 
up a gavel. “Or was. Still am, I 
suppose.” He turned to Forrest, 
his face serious. “You can tell 
B.H. that if the Identities are go- 
ing to get me — they can get me. 
I’ve lived long enough. I’ve had a 
quiet life the past twelve years. I 
don’t want to leave here. If this is 
the end— so be it.” He tapped the 
gavel expertly. “You go back 
without me. And that’s my last 
word.” 

Forrest thought he detected a 
flaw in the situation. He had 
guessed Harrison was something 
of a nut — he had been a hermit for 
years and would fight to stay as he 
was. But he ought to know the 
score. He was a student of inter- 
stellar history. He was Howard’s 
close buddy and ought to have 
some respect for his military opin- 
ions. It would seem that, regard- 
less of his attachment to this 
place, Harrison would sacrifice his 
personal feelings for the big pic- 
ture — the danger that all of them 
were in, together. Though a loner, 
Harrison was not known to be anti- 
social or unpatriotic. 

Forrest sat down in one of the 
councilmen’s seats, while Har- 
rison browsed through old record 
books. Forrest believed his own 
silence would be expected after 
the unanswerable finality of 
Harrison’s last statement. For- 
rest would seem to be thinking 
hard — which he was. 



STAR CROSSING 



103 




I N HIS short stay on the island 
he had seen many facets of War- 
ner Harrison, the hermit of Mar- 
coni. He had seen the sick man, the 
happy recluse, the hobbyist, the 
pedant, the zany, the friendly 
guide, the reminiscent old man, 
the defiant one. It was as if Harri- 
son was trying to reveal all the 
traits of his character in a single 
day. He seemed to want to con- 
vince Forrest that he really was 
Harrison. 

But why would the hermit want 
to do that? 

Forrest stiffened. If he really 
were Harrison he wouldn’t give a 
damn. He might still want to stay 
on the island, come hell or high 
water — but if, -Harrison -were not 
Harrison, was an alien, a Dent, he 
would only say he wanted to stay 
on the island, but would really 
want to go to Mark Station. For- 
rest closed his eyes, tried to think 
clearly and dispassionately while 
his brain was whirling. 

The Identities were imitators, 
actors, and were getting better all 
the time. If Harrison was a 
Dent — then all the tests had failed. 
Howard had better be ad- 
vised — and quickly. How could 
Forrest be sure, though? He could 
not challenge Harrison with an 
explosive accusation. 

One thing characterized the 
Dents’ acting, good as it was. 
Sometimes they overacted. Un- 
less they had conquered -this fail- 
ing. For, if Harrison Was a Dent, 



this particular Dent deserved to 
win the Academy Award. 

Forrest felt for the pistol under 
his raincoat, looking at Harri- 
son speculatively as he prowled 
the bookshelves of the council 
chamber. Harrison? Could he 
even think of him now as Harri- 
son? There was no certainty, one 
way or the other. He tried to keep 
in mind the fleeting thought he 
had just had; it might be the key. 
All actors overact, at times. They 
must. They are playing out a lie 
and the lie must be strongly con- 
structed. The Identities, with their 
perfect memories, were capable 
of building the ultimate lie — an 
imitation human being. In 
strengthening the fiction they 
might go too far, just to make sure 
they were believable. 

He thought of the little Earth 
animal, some kind of rodent, which 
had a life-saving habit of playing 
dead when approached by some 
dangerous predator. He had read 
somewhere that this creature 
feigned death perfectly, could be 
touched and handled without show- 
ing signs of life. But when placed 
upright it would roll over and play 
dead again. Such an action 
wouldn’t fool anyone but the other 
dumb animals. 

Harrison was at the window. “It 
looks like it’s letting up,” he said. 
“Let’s go take a look at the 
beach.” 

Forrest forced himself to get up 
in spite of his shaky knees. Trying 



104 



IF 




not to appear nervous, he walked 
out with — Harrison? 



IV 

T HE other side of the city hall 
overlooked a park. The gray 
ocean lay beyond. There was a 
small beach below the sea wall, 
protected by a breakwater. The 
rain had almost stopped and the 
sky was brighter, though still over- 
cast. The waters were slate gray 
and full of tossing whitecaps. 
Forrest and Harrison stood on 
the city hall steps. 

Harrison said, “You can see the 
whole outer shoreline, from here. 
Look for aliens while you have the 
opportunity.” 

To one side were an amusement 
center and a playground; on the 
other were small apartment 
houses. The park extended along 
the shore and the beach could be 
seen along its entire length. There 
was a boat-landing farther on, 
but otherwise nothing broke the 
symmetry of the combers and the 
sands. 

What a perfect place for a Dent 
capsule to land, out of sight of the 
observatory ... 

They stood for a while in si- 
lence, the sounds of the seashore 
coming faintly up to them. Some- 
thing seemed missing. 

“No sea gulls,” said Forrest. 
“No fish,” said Harrison. 
“There’s some life on this planet. 



but it’s very primitive. About th? 
trilobite stage. Still, when the men 
imported some fish for sporting 
purposes something ate them. In- 
teresting, but not my line.” 

Forrest was thinking of how to 
prove that this man was or was not 
a Dent. How could he? No test 
would work now. He couldn’t test 
Harrison for overacting. Had Har- 
rison rolled over once too often? It 
was strange that the radio was out, 
while no reception was possible ‘in 
any case because of the storm and 
because the mast was down, too. 
That the copter was wrecked, 
though no one, least of all Harris- 
on, would think of flying one in 
this weather. That he had con- 
tacted Howard by means of a hay- 
wire hookup via the stars — but not 
even that was destroyed. The situa- 
tion was too pat. 

There was one way to make Har- 
rison show his hand. Hermit and 
Dent had different goals, differ- 
ent intentions. 

It was Forrest’s turn to lie. 

“I don’t think the capsule has 
landed here at all,” he said, watch- 
ing Harrison’s reactions. “I 
think I’d better get back to Mark. 
If you don’t want to come, all 
right. I’ll talk B. H. out of bomb- 
ing the island. If he’s held out this 
long, he’ll wait till I contact him. 
You can stay here and more power 
to you. If the Dents come, give ’em 
hell.” 

“I can take care of the Dents,” 
said Harrison.

T HEY returned by a different 
route, walking past the 
workers’ deserted apartment 
houses. Harrison took Forrest 
through one of them and he found 
it still in livable condition. Mere- 
ly uninhabited. Harrison was si- 
lent now — he seemed to be baf- 
fled. Was he trying to think of a 
way to reverse his stand? Forrest 
found himself waiting for Harri- 
son to suggest that perhaps he 
might change his mind and leave 
the island after all . 

Not that this in itself would 
prove that Harrison was — or was 
not — a Dent. Forrest would have 
to come up with a test, a positive 
one. 

He had not tried a physical ex- 
amination — he wished he had done 
so when he had had a chance, but 
at that moment Harrison had been 
ill and had just passed two tests 
with flying colors. If Forrest pulled 
a pistol on him now to force him to 
submit to an examination, the 
game would be over. Harrison had 
a pistol too. 

The game would be over — may- 
be a showdown was best by now. 
Forrest’s own play-acting had 
gone on long enough. The real 
Harrison should not object to 
physical examination. And sudden- 
ly Forrest remembered — another 
test that could bear repetition. 

When Harrison led him out to 
the street and across it to the old 
theater, Forrest saw his opportu- 
nity had come. Theaters were not 



lit from outside and could be 
made perfectly dark. He was go- 
ing to try the “blink” test again. 

“This was once the most popu- 
lar place on the island,” Harrison 
was saying, walking down the 
theater aisle. “I just wanted to see 
it one more time before — before 
you go.” He walked to the front 
row and sat down. 

The lights had come on when 
they had entered, as they had in all 
the other buildings. But here, 
Forrest thought, there had to be a 
switch. He walked below the stage, 
pretending to be inspecting the 
place, but actually he was headed 
for the side door. As he reached it 
he noted with satisfaction that 
there was a switch on the wall. He 
put his back to it, leaned against it, 
facing the interior of the theater. 

“Harrison,” he said. “I’m sorry, 
but my time’s up. I really have to 
be going. Now.” 

The other man looked at him 
and said, “Wait. I’ve changed my 
mind. I think I’ll go back to Mark 
with you after all.” He stood up, 
started toward Forrest. 

You haven't changed your mind , 
just your body , thought Forrest. 
He took out the pistol, pointed it at 
Harrison. 

“Stand where you are.’’ He 
flashed on the light, playing it on 
Harrison’s face. “You blink too 
much. Can’t you face a strong 
light?” 

Harrison’s eyes widened, but he 
stood still. “What’s the matter with 



106 



IF 




you, Forrest? Have you gone 
insane?” He held his hands loosely 
in the air. 

“No, I’ve suddenly gone sane. 
Stand right where you are — don’t 
move.” 

Harrison attempted to smile. 
“What is this, another test?” 



F OR an answer, Forrest reached 
behind him and snapped out the 
house lights. He also turned off his 
flashlight. Pitch blackness sur- 
rounded him and he suddenly real- 
ized that this was a foolhardy thing 
to do. 

He counted silently, intending to 
count to ten. But at five he lost his 
nerve and flicked on the flashlight. 
The brilliant beam lit the pale face 
of Harrison, now much closer to 
him, eyes unblinking in the full 
glare of the light. He saw that 
Harrison had his own pistol out. 
Forrest flipped off the light, 
ducked and fired almost simul- 
taneously with Harrison. Both 
shots went wild. In the darkness 
Forrest went for the door. 

It was only a few feet behind 
him. He plunged into the dimly lit 
alleyway, which soon led him to 
the marketplace. He was not go- 
ing to go after Harrison now — it 
was back to the skater and he knew 
the way. 

He ran across the wet square and 
made for the bridge. The 
observatory was plainly in 
sight — the rain was only falling 



lightly. He risked turning around 
and saw Harrison — or the 
Dent— just now coming out of the 
theater, aiming a shot at him. He 
ducked, returned fire and started a 
zigzag run toward the bridge. He 
saw with satisfaction that he could 
outrun Harrison all the way. 

Harrison? It was hard to think of 
his pursuer as a Dent — an alien 
Identity. The real Harrison was 
probably dead. The test had 
worked — or rather, the trap. The 
Dent had decided that the situation 
had become unpredictable and had 
tried to take advantage of the dark- 
ness that Forrest unexpectedly had 
given him. 

He had exposed the alien, but he 
was barely escaping with his life. 
What would Howard say? Howard 
had warned Forrest to be careful, 
and now he had fiddled away hours 
talking to a damned Dent. Now if 
he could just get back to the skater 
and launch it, back to Mark and 
tell B.H. to loose the missiles, the 
situation might still be saved. It 
certainly was a wonderful 
thing . 

He pounded onto the bridge, al- 
most tripping over the roller- 
coaster tracks. That crazy 
ride — that should have been his tip- 
off. He should have gone back to 
the skater then. 

Another shot whistled past him, 
whined off the buildings on the far 
side. He was halfway across the 
bridge and decided not to slow 
down to see what Harrison was 



STAR CROSSING

V 



doing. Better to concentrate on 
running. 

Nearly across the bridge, trying 
to think of the shortest way to the 
skater ramp, he saw a figure ahead 
of him, beyond the end of the 
bridge. 

A man wearing a flapping rain- 
coat was running toward him. The 
gait, the bulk, the blue suit show- 
ing under the open raincoat, all 
were familiar. 

Howard. 

Forrest didn’t pause— he con- 
tinued running. What was Com- 
mander Howard doing here? How 
had he come here? Who was watch- 
ing the store? 

“B.H.,” he called, “Get back! 
Harrison is a Dent and he’s right 
behind me—’’ 

He ran to within a few yards of 
Howard, turned, aiming his pistol. 
He could not see Harrison, who 
was not yet on the bridge, but he 
squeezed off a shot anyway, heard 
it ricochet across the railings. Then 
the figure of Harrison appeared at 
the far end of the bridge, pumping 
away, and Forrest took careful 
aim. 

He couldn’t miss. 

Something hit him from behind. 
Clubbing blows on his head and 
shoulders caused him to drop the 
pistol and fall to the wet pave- 
ment. Rapidly losing conscious- 
ness, he saw Howard standing over 
him, his face expressionless. He 
heard Harrison’s voice, then noth- 
ing. 



J IM FORREST came to his 
senses gradually against the 
resistance of a throbbing head- 
ache, a loud roaring, a tightly 
cramped position, and, over all, a 
continuous jouncing motion. 
Though he seemed unable to move 
his body he was never still — he was 
seated, legs folded, upon a jolting 
floor, which slanted and jumped, 
tossing him about with every shift 
and slide. Even before he opened 
his eyes he realized he was in the 
rear compartment of the skater, 
moving at top speed through the 
fury of a storm. Pain and sickness 
threatened to return him to un- 
consciousness. He groaned, shook 
his head to clear it and opened his 
eyes. 

He was facing forward, his back 
against the rear panel, next to some 
luggage. He was surprised to find 
he was not tied, but he could not 
move his limbs — or at least he 
found that it was extremely diffi- 
cult to move them. A sort of numb- 
ness enfolded him, not entirely ex- 
plained by his stiff and cramped 
position. It felt like some kind of 
paralysis, slowly wearing off. 

Harrison and Howard sat in the 
front seats, ^either, of course, was 
human. Harrison — not- Harri- 
son — was driving the skater. The 
storm was worse than ever and 
Howard — or the Dent who looked 
like Howard — was helping to 
drive, as was the automatic pilot. 



108 



IF 




its whining up and down the scale 
adding to the din — and between 
the three of them they were having 
a difficult time. Forrest could not 
help smiling, despite his predica- 
ment. Everyone had problems. 

Lightning and darkness and 
driving rain were all he could see 
through the windows. He could not 
see the instruments from where he 
was, but he could imagine their 
wild warnings. The waves could be 
heard — and felt — hitting the 
bottom of the skater. Take it up 
higher , he tried to say, but he could 
not make an intelligible sound. 
Soon, however, the aliens seemed 
to arrive at the same conclusion 
and the skater became more 
stable. The shaking continued 
with moderation. The Dent-that- 
was-Howard relinquished the con- 
trols to Dent-Harrison and turned 
around. 

Forrest looked into the face of 
Howard that was not the face of 
Howard. He felt sick. He wanted 
to go back to unconsciousness, 
but instead stared into the eyes of 
the Dent. He imagined he could see 
hatred there, but he could not be 
sure. He knew nothing about the 
psychology of the Identities — he 
would soon learn, he imagined. 

“Is he awake?” asked Dent- 
Harrison, not turning around, his 
attention on the instruments. 

Dent-Howard opened his mouth 
and a croaking sound came from it. 

“Speak English,” admonished 
the other Dent. “You’ve got to 



keep in practice, *ven if we won’t 
need your impersonation for a 
while.” 

“Practice?” snapped Dent- 
Howard. “I fooled Harrison — and 
you didn’t fool this one.” 

“All right, I admit I delayed too 
long. He wasn’t suspicious at first. 
But I had to play hard to convince, 
remember.” Forrest noticed that 
Dent-Harrison was wearing a 
slightly different combination of 
clashing colors, purple and green. 

Dent-Howard, in the usual sub- 
dued blue, seemed angry. “And so 
you nearly ruined our chances. If I 
hadn’t come running you would 
have let him escape in the 
skater — and then where would we 
be?” 

“I thought of calling you from 
the theater, didn’t I? That was 
quick thinking — ” 

“The only time you ever thought 
anything quickly. If you weren’t 
my own bud I’d — ” He ended with 
a croaking, hissing sound. 

D ENT-HARRISON was silent, 
busying himself with the con- 
trols. Dent-Howard looked coldly 
at Forrest — an expression that 
Forrest himself had never seen on 
the real Howard’s face. 

“What’ll we do with him?” 
Forrest waited for the other 
Dent’s reply. 

“Why — we’ll use him. Even 
though we can no longer use him as 
a dupe, we can use him as a mod- 
el.” 



STAR CROSSING 



109 




Forrest couldn’t see Dent-Harri- 
son’s face, but he imagined the 
alien smiled. 

“He would have been better as a 
dupe,’’ croaked Dent-Howard. 

“Of course,” returned Dent- 
Harrison. “But we Krawk-sss — ” 

Now it was Dent-Howard’s turn 
to admonish. 

“Dents! Don’t say Krawk-sss. 
You must remember.” 

“Identities — always say, if one 
thing doesn’t work, try another. It 
would be hard for me to go it alone 
now, try to convince Howard that 
Forrest got lost or killed or some- 
thing — that would immediately 
make him suspicious. So we’ve got 
to replace Forrest with another 
imitation.” 

“Not me,” said Dent-Howard. 
“I can’t shift from character to 
character, like a damn repertory 
player. This is method acting, and 
you’ve got to be the man you im- 
personate. Trying to do more than 
one character weakens both. Note 
how well I’ve learned. I don’t have 
to tell you how important this 
expedition is. There can’t be any 
more slips. That’s why they chose 
me — us. I’ve got to keep on being 
Commander Howard — later we’ll 
be using him in contact with the 
outside.” Dent-Howard’s face be- 
came almost genial. “Two down 
and one to go. Tomorrow we con- 
trol Marconi — and with it this sys- 
tem. The day after that, the stellar 
sphere.” 

“You’re getting ahead of your- 



self. We haven’t head from the star- 
ship yet.” 

“We will. As soon as we do our 
part, they’ll do theirs.” 

“If this storm keeps up — ” be- 
gan Dent-Harrison. 

“It had better keep up,” said 
Dent-Howard. “I don’t know how 
long it’s supposed to last, but our 
people will be back and seed 
another before this one blows it- 
self out, if necessary. By that time 
we’ll be in possession of the sta- 
tion and we won’t have to worry 
about cover. And then we won’t 
have to worry about anything. 
We’ll dominate space from 
Denebola to system’s end. 
Say— he’s moving a little. 1 
thought you—” 

Forrest had managed to move 
his arms a bit, but had only suc- 
ceeded in attracting the Dent’s 
attention. Dent-Howard frowned, 
reached out a hand and touched 
Forrest on the side of the neck with 
the tip of a finger. It seemed to 
Forrest that a needle had struck 
him — he felt a stinging, pain, then 
numbness. He became dizzy; then 
the dizziness steadied into a 
paralysis that spread down his neck 
and shoulders and through his 
body. So this was how they had 
kept him quiet, without the 
necessity of bonds. What were the 
Dents, anyway? What kind of 
creatures were they really? 

Dent-Harrison said, not turning 
from the control panel, “You’ll 
have to bud again.” 



110 



IF 




“Why me? Why not you this 
time? It takes a lot out of me/' 
complained Dent-Howard. 

“You'll have more time to rest. 
I'll have to do Harrison very short- 
ly, when we contact Mark Station. 
This is the most important im- 
personation we've attempted and 
I'll have to be alert. Howard knows 
Harrison well. He hardly knows 
Forrest at all." 

“He has the personnel records 
on Forrest. We don't." 

“We have the original." From 
the sound of his voice, Dent-Harri- 
son was grinning. 

Without further argument, 
Dent-Howard stood up as far up as 
the ceiling of the skater allowed, 
swung the seat back and climbed 
into the rear compartment, 
pushing Forrest to one side. 
Jammed back against the luggage 
in a corner, Forrest watched 
helplessly. 

The Dent took off his blue coat, 
swaying slightly, but managed to 
remain standing. The skater ran 
more smoothly now, gave a jar or 
twist only now and then. Dent- 
Harrison was driving better— the 
Dents learned fast. 



D ENT-HOWARD stripped to 
his undergarments, which 
showed him as beefy but not flab- 
by and very pink-skinned. 

Swiftly, the pink changed to 
gray. 

His face lost its features along 



with its color. The Dent’s body be- 
came slighter and a little shorter. 
The arms and legs became 
smooth, shiny, modeling-clay 
gray. The arms now ended in long, 
tapering fingers and the legs and 
feet were like gray boots. The torso 
became tubular and the head like 
a gray rubber ball, balanced on a 
small neck. Two black spots of 
eyes and a small oval mouth were 
all the features that remained. 

The trade-Dent slipped off the 
loose underclothing and was 
revealed as sexless and uniformly 
smooth, gray and shiny all over. 
Rubber doll was a fitting descrip- 
tion. Forrest shrank back in his 
corner. 

The Dent wasn't horrible in 
itself. It was more comic than 
frightening, but Forrest had the 
feeling of a nightmare coming on. 
He was overcome with a child- 
hood fear, of the circus-Dent back 
on Einstein, the parody of Man, 
with its black spot eyes and comic 
mouth. The Dent who had been 
Howard had reverted to the trade- 
form, which, Forrest remembered 
all too well, was still not the real 
Dent. 

Now another transformation 
was taking place. Forrest wished 
he could look away, but he stared, 
fascinated. He had never seen an 
original Dent, nor had any other 
human alive, as far as he knew. He 
fought down his horror, kept his 
eyes open. 

The rubber-doll aspect began to 



STAR CROSSING 



111 




disappear, but the gray color re- 
mained. The figure shortened 
again, or perhaps it only seemed 
so because the head was vanish- 
ing into the shoulders. Watching 
this, Forrest missed seeing the legs 
grow together, but now they were 
one, the figure standing solidly 
like a gray tree trunk. It only 
swayed slightly when the skater hit 
a rough spot, painfully jolting 
Forrest against the wall. 

The top of the rapidly changing 
creature was not flat, except for a 
circular mouth facing upward. 
The arms shortened while the 
fingers lengthened, becoming 
tentacles. Now a crown of ten wav- 
ing tentacles surrounded the 
mouth, topping the cylindrical 
body, which tapered to a single foot 
or base, not rooted to the floor but 
moving freely, if slowly. The crea- 
ture as a whole looked like some 
sort of gigantic polyp. Which no 
doubt it was, Forrest thought. 

Howard’s clothes, scattered on 
the floor, seemed utterly irrele- 
vant to the thing standing there, 
tentacles waving. Forrest had to 
look out the window at the raging 
storm for a moment to steady 
himself. 

Of all forms of life, this was one 
of the lowest. The coelenterates of 
Earth’s warm seas* near the base of 
the evolutionary tree, did not even 
have a circulatory system, nor a 
separate digestive tract. They were 
simply animated barrels. 

Forrest smiled, in spite of him- 



self. He was thinking of Harrison 
at the beach — Harrison, or Dent- 
Harrison, had mentioned trilo- 
bites. It would be a long, long 
time before creatures such as the 
Identities could reach the level of 
the trilobites — even if they hadn’t 
branched off in another direction. 
So these were the real Dents. For- 
rest had expected something dif- 
ferent: insects, squids, spiders, 
slugs — all of them less alien than 
this. 

He and the Dents — or at least 
the similar forms of life on Earth — 
had had nothing in common since 
before the planarian worms and a 
little after the sponges. The Dents 
weren’t even bilateral, they were 
radially symmetrical. How alien 
can you get? 

Yet he had to hand it to them. Of 
all the many forms of life which 
had attained intelligence within 
the explored stellar sphere, this was 
the only race he had heard of that 
belonged to the coelenterata . On 
many planets, similar forms of 
diverse origin conformed to condi- 
tions that were similar, just as on 
Earth creatures of different 
ancestry approached each other in 
form. So the polyps were not pecu- 
liar to Earth. These had attained 
great size, were able to live out of 
water and support themselves 
without skeletons, he supposed. 
And they had somehow added 
protective mimicry, shape-chang- 
ing. No skeleton, a soft, tough, 
rubbery skin— just right for it. 



112 



IF 




The gray creature was standing 
as if rooted yet it was in constant 
motion. The tentacles were wav- 
ing inward and outward in a com- 
plex motion that made Forrest 
dizzy. One reached toward him— a 
long filament came out of its tip, 
touched Forrest’s cheek and he felt 
numb again. He had time to think 
of the stinging nettles of the 
Hydra. 

The tentacles seized Forrest 
roughly, pulled him up, held him 
suspended for a moment, then 
threw him back into the corner. 

“What are you doing?” inquired 
Dent-Harrison. “Don’t eat him.” 

The polyp-creature made a deep 
approximation of Howard’s voice. 
“I deserve him after all the trouble 
he’s caused me.” His voice sounded 
as if it came from a rain barrel. 

“The trouble he’s caused youV ’ 
said Dent-Harrison. “Why didn’t 
you eat Harrison while you were in 
the storeroom?” 

“I thought you still needed him 
for study,” boomed the other Dent. 

“Well, we still need Forrest 
now.” Dent-Harrison turned back 
to the controls. 



F ORREST suddenly felt better. 

This was a reprieve. And Har- 
rison was alive, back on the is- 
land. He wouldn’t be of any im- 
mediate help, back there with no 
transportation and probably 
locked up, but his being alive was 
a plus. The Dents, like people, had 



regrets, made mistakes. Forrest 
began to feel like a man again. 

He knew now that the Dent land- 
ing was no mere spying mission. 
This was a planned attempt to take 
over Marconi Station and with it 
the entire planet and system. He 
wished he had some way of 
communicating with Howard. 
What he could tell him! Not the 
least of it would be that the Dents 
by their hostile landing had com- 
mitted an act of war and need no 
longer be dealt with as nonbellig- 
erents. 

Forrest looked speculatively at 
the alien creature, now quiescent. 
In spite of the queasy feeling it 
gave him, he could not help but feel 
admiration for the thing. It was al- 
most alone on an alien planet, 
carrying out its mission with rigid 
self-control. So this was the ene- 
my. 

Dent-Harrison said impatiently, 
“Get on with it. We haven’t got all 
day.” 

The Hydralike creature stirred. 
A round bump formed on its side. 
This grew into a bud, a branch a 
few inches long. A crown formed at 
its tip — a crown of tentacles. The 
bud separated and dropped off. It 
righted itself and attached its lower 
surface to the floor. Then it began 
to move. Forrest watched it for a 
long time. It seemed to grow taller 
and thicker, its tentacles waving. 

He heard a rustling noise and 
saw that the bigger Dent had 
already changed back to the trade-

form, was dressing in Howard's 
clothes. The figure looked 
ludicruous for a while in the con- 
servative blue suit, then the gray- 
ness faded and the Dent assumed 
the ruddy features of Com- 
mander Howard. It pushed past 
Forrest and rummaged in the 
bags, found something which it 
tossed to the little creature on the 
floor. The latter caught the food 
deftly in its tentacles, brought it to 
its mouth cavity. 

Forrest felt dizzy and sick. He 
could take it no longer. He passed 
out again. 



VI 

H E WAS talking, talking ear- 
nestly, telling B.H. all about 
the alien menace, and Howard 
didn’t seem to care or understand 
him. He tried to tell Harrison; but 
Harrison only grinned and turned 
away. Forrest tried to explain to a 
faceless rubber doll with eyes like 
black dots, but the doll wouldn’t 
listen either. He was writing a 
report and, after he had finished 
each page, the paper disintegrated. 
He was talking on the phone and 
the party at the other end couldn’t 
seem to hear — there was too much 
noise, a pounding, crashing, roar- 
ing. The sound of the storm 
separated from the roar of the 
skater. He realized that he had 
been dreaming. 

Forrest struggled to sit up. He 



felt more uncomfortable than 
ever. He was not only stiff but his 
throat was sore. He was bone-tired. 
He also felt oddly constricted and 
saw that he was wearing strange 
clothes. They looked like one of 
Harrison's outfits, too small for 
him and with weirdly clashing 
colors. The red-and-tan striped 
shirt, the blue-and-green dotted 
slacks, the bright red shoesox 
earned his sincere distaste. What 
had the Dents done with his own 
clothes? 

Dent-Howard was sound asleep 
on the floor. The strange new 
Hydra bud was nowhere in sight. 
Occupying the seats ahead were 
Dent-Harrison and another, a 
taller, younger man. Dent-Harri- 
son was talking in low tones. 

Who was the other man? From 
where Forrest was sitting, he could 
see only the curly brown hair, the 
back of the head and fair-skinned 
neck, the green-and-brown fitted 
collar-shawl over the natty dark 
brown shirt— so that was where his 
clothes had gone. 

Dent-Harrison glanced back 
over his shoulder, remarked, “I 
think your prototype is awake.” 

The tall man turned his head and 
looked at Forrest, who stared 
back in a daze. That face was 
familiar. The young man showed a 
superior smile. That smile was 
familiar, too. The stranger spoke. 
Even the voice was familiar. 

“It certainly is a wonderful 
thing,” he said. 



114 



IF 




Forrest groaned. He’d have to 
call this one Dent-Forrest. 

Dent-Harrison took the con- 
trols and the Dent that looked like 
Forrest resumed asking ques- 
tions. Forrest did not want to 
talk, but found he couldn’t help 
answering. Everything, from 
military information to personal 
secrets, came out. When the Dent 
paused in his questioning Forrest 
found himself volunteering 
further information, unasked. 
Things the Dent would never have 
thought of, probably. 

Dent-Forrest flashed his 
superior smile. “We can’t really 
read minds,’’ he explained. “But 
we have something just as good, 
you see. We have drugs to loosen 
your tongues. Combined with our 
encyclopedic knowledge and our 
tape-recorder memories, what else 
is needed? Of course only select 
spies, with great talents, such 
as — we — are chosen for infiltra- 
tion.’’ 

What an insufferable egotist , 
thought Forrest. Then he realized 
that the Dent was faithfully 
copying his own image. He re- 
solved to reform if he ever got out 
of this. 

“We’ve only recently perfected 
our disguises,’’ said Dent-Forrest. 
“Your vaunted ‘elapsed time test’ 
is no good any more— nor are any 
of your other tests. If you really 
want to know, you’ve been 
defeated by our scientific inventive- 
ness, something of yours we’ve 



also developed only recently. 
Hoist with your own petard. A sim- 
ple injection of a radioactive ele- 
ment gives us all the time-sense we 
need. Other tests can be counter- 
acted— that’s a good word, 
counteracted , because it is our 
superior acting ability that defeats 
you.’’ 

“How about overacting?’’ 

The Dent sneered. “Watch your 
language. Speak when I tell you to 
speak and then don’t stop till I tell 
you to stop. For too long we 
Dents — Identities — even the name 
is derogatory; we don’t all look 
alike — we Krawk-sss have posed as 
silly traders. Do you think this is 
the start of a war? It’s been a war 
for a long time. We expanded into 
the region of Denebola for the ex- 
press purpose of cutting your em- 
pire in half. We’re going to take 
over this planet first — with its im- 
penetrable defenses that can be 
run by only one-man. How? By re- 
placing that man with one of ours.’’ 

“You haven’t replaced Howard 
yet.’’ 

’‘No, but it’s just a matter of 
time. We had to do all this in 
stages, first by coming in under 
cover of a storm — our own storm, 
by the way — then by landing on 
Nexus Island, the weakest spot on 
the planet, and imitating one of 
you, Howard, to capture another 
one of you, Harrison. Then our 
clever scheme of sending a 
message — ’’ 

Forrest frowned. 



STAR CROSSING

“Then Harrison didn’t even send 
that message?” 

“Of course not. I — we sent it. 
You should have been more 
suspicious.” 

“You still haven’t got to Mark 
Station. B.H. is not as defenseless 
as Harrison was.” 

“I know,” said the Dent. “This 
is why we chose this roundabout 
method. We couldn’t possibly have 
taken Mark Station by force. So 
we worked out this infiltration 
scheme, involving only one Dent at 
first. Of course we found it nec- 
essary to increase our number to 
three.” He grinned. “The only 
tough thing was getting a dossier 
on Commander Howard in the 
first place. We didn’t have a live 
model, so we faked him, even to 
Dent-manufactured clothing. 
Since he is a public figure the task 
was not impossible, merely diffi- 
cult. And the result fooled Harri- 
son for the short time necessary. 
That was all that was intended. 
Next time we’ll have a live model 
to work from.” 



F ORREST wondered if they 
really would — he pictured B.H. 
pressing the Panic Button, blow- 
ing up the planet. Then he was tell- 
ing the Dent about the 
button — against his will. 

Dent-Forrest shook his head. 
“We know all about the Panic 
Button. It will be touch-and- 
go — but we can handle it. If the 



planet is destroyed, of course, that 
would be a victory for us too, but 
we don’t want it that way. We have 
plans. No use telling them to you 
now. You might — talk.” He smiled 
maliciously. 

Forrest’s mind was racing. The 
fact that this invasion was so 
carefully planned might be its 
weakness. Maybe it would succeed 
only if everything went exactly 
right. A slight deviation had 
already been forced by his ex- 
posure of Dent-Harrison, making 
it necessary for them to create a 
subsitute for himself. 

Another deviation it might mean 
their defeat. 

But how could he force another 
one? The Dents might fool B.H. 
at least long enough to land on 
Mark Island and get inside the 
base. They were, ostensibly, Jim 
Forrest and Warner Harrison 
coming back from Nexus, For- 
rest bringing Harrison to safety 
from the aliens. Howard, if not 
told otherwise, would believe that 
bringing them inside his defenses 
would make Marconi safer. 

Warned, Howard had the fire- 
power to blow the skater out of the 
water as it approached the island. 
If he missed he could push the 
button that would mean his own 
destruction and everyone else’s. 
Forrest was wishing for his own 
death in hoping to warn Howard, 
but he knew that letting the Dents 
take Marconi was worse. This was 
only one battle in a big campaign 



116 



IF 




to take over the stellar sphere, but 
it was a decisive one, as first battles 
sometimes are. 

Forrest had no illusions about 
his own survival much longer. The 
Dents wouldn’t be needing him 
once they had taken the base. They 
needed him now for questioning 
and study, but he didn’t know for 
how long. Dent-Forrest was be- 
coming pretty convincing. Dent- 
Harrison was nearly perfect and 
couldn’t help, but fool Howard. 
Forrest couldn’t do anything 
about that — but he might be able 
to do something about the imita- 
tion of himself, before it was too 
late. 

Perhaps he^ could strike some 
false note, speak some unchar- 
acteristic phrase or give some 
phony information that would, 
when Commander Howard heard 
it, betray Dent-Forrest. This 
second-hand method was Forrest’s 
only hope of warning Howard, be- 
cause he knew that when the time 
came for contacting the station he 
would not be allowed to talk, 
move or even be seen. 

But Dent-Forrest, as well as 
Dent-Harrison earlier, had al- 
ready gotten a lot out of him, 
more than Forrest himself 
realized, perhaps. What could he 
say that was out of character now? 
One problem was the fact that 
B.H. really didn’t know him very 
well. Forrest tried to recall what 
he and Howard had discussed in 
the Mark control room just before 



this mission. He had probably 
already blurted out to Dent-For- 
rest everything Howard had said. 
What had he himself said that he 
might not have told the Dents, that 
he could falsify now? 

He remembered something 
about a comic book. No, it was 
Howard who had mentioned 
comics. Forrest could remember 
saying nothing that hadn’t been a 
direct response to something 
Howard had said and therefore 
known to the Dents. 

He had suggested some ideas to 
Howard — could he switch credits, 
say that one of his suggestions had 
been Howard’s? [fid Howard re- 
member the dialogue well enough 
for the switch to have meaning? 

Forrest spoke, heedless of the 
Dent’s orders. “1 wish Howard had 
carried out his idea to shoot 
missiles at the island. I wouldn't 
have minded — ” 

“That was your idea, wasn’t it?’’ 
said Dent-Forrest. 

“Yeah. I guess it was. After I 
told him the Dents were danger- 
ous — ” 

The Dent mimicked, “ ‘What’s 
so dangerous about a couple of 
lousy Dents landing in a capsule?’ ” 

Forrest sighed. “I guess I talk in 
my sleep. Calling you lousy is a 
compliment, anyway. No offense, 
of course.” 

The other grinned. “Well, it’s 
been nice talking to you. Pretty 
soon we’ll be contacting Howard 
and, you’ll have to keep quiet. 



STAR CROSSING 



117 




Maybe this will help.” The Dent 
flicked his fingertip several times 
around Forrest’s mouth and he 
found he couldn’t move his lips or 
make a sound. 

. Now he couldn’t talk at all. He 
had failed in trying to fake 
something and now it was too late. 
It certainly was a wonderful 
thing . 



T HE skater roared on toward 
Mark Station. That it was quite 
close now was evident from the fact 
that Dent-Harrison was trying to 
make radio contact. Dent-Forrest, 
now driving, was likewise preoc- 
cupied. The wind had increased 
and was tossing the little ship from 
side to side. Oblivious to it all, 
Dent-Howard was sleeping soundly 
in one corner of the rear compart- 
ment, while Forrest sat wakefully 
in the other corner. Now is the 
time for all good men to come to 
the aid of the party . ran 
through his mind, ironically ap- 
propriate. 

Forrest tried to move his legs 
and found that he could move 
them. All the numbing stings that 
he had recently received had been 
on his face and neck and the 
numbness had spread through his 
upper body alone. His legs seemed 
to have lost their previous paral- 
ysis. He shifted about uncom- 
fortably, straightened his legs and 
stood up, leaning against the 
corner of the wall, swaying with 



the skater’s motion. No one 
noticed. The quick brown fox 
jumps over the lazy dog . 

As an experienced skater pilot, 
Forrest knew the way the ship was 
balanced precariously atop its jet- 
stream. And not too irrelevantly, 
yet another typing-practice sen- 
tence popped into his mind. A 
quick movement of the enemy will 
jeopardize six gunboats . 

He put one foot against the wall 
and braced. Starting to topple to- 
ward the center of the compart- 
ment, toward the sleeping Dent on 
the other side, he put all his 
strength into the kick, hoping he’d 
fall on Dent-Howard instead of 
the hard floor. Fighting to keep 
from bending his knees, he threw 
his body sideways, tumbled head- 
long across the compartment. 

At once the skater faltered. For- 
rest landed on Dent-Howard’s 
body with a thud and the skater 
slipped sideways, off balance, and 
plunged into the waves with a 
tremendous crash. Forrest, 
jammed into the back of the front 
seat, was not thrown forward with 
the terrific deceleration. The 
shock of water reducing its speed, 
the skater' bounded into the air 
and down again, now on its side, 
now upright, and Forrest was 
tossed about with the luggage and 
Dent-Howard. The splashing and 
crashing seemed interminable. 

Cries of alarm and confusion re- 
vealed that the two Dents in the pi- 
lots’s seats were trying to stop the 



118 



IF 




skater. After it had skipped and 
bounced along for a few moments 
more they finally succeeded. Now 
it tossed about, floating upright on 
the water, swaying to the motion of 
the waves, its engines idling. The 
rain pounded on the roof, but 
stayed outside. No windows were 
broken. 

Strapped in, Dent-Harrison and 
Dent-Forrest had not been in- 
jured. Dent-Howard was uncon- 
scious and Forrest was nearly so. 
After a cursory examination of the 
ship the two Dents were satisfied 
that no major damage had been 
done. The skaters were tough little 
craft. 

Dent-Howard stirred, opened his 
eyes, shook his head and asked, 
“What happened?” He turned 
over, pushed Forrest away from 
him. 

“We struck a waterspout or 
something,” said Dent-Harrison, 
matter-of-factly. “You should 
strap down back there.” 

Forrest, unhurt but thoroughly 
discouraged, stayed motionless. As 
long as he had not succeeded in 
wrecking the skater, he was glad 
they didn’t realize he was to blame 
for the incident. But when would 
he get another chance? Dent- 
Howard was awake now and alert 
to any movement. 



D ENT-HARRISON roared the 
engines, the skater bucked 
along on the waves and rose into 



the slightly smoother air. Dent- 
Forrest took his turn at the radio, 
trying to contact Mark Station 
and Commander Howard. 

What would happen next? When 
the Dents talked to Howard, what 
would he do? It all depended on 
how good the imitations were. For- 
rest wanted to believe otherwise 
but he was convinced that they 
were good enough. Once inside the 
base — His thoughts were inter- 
rupted by a warning from Dent- 
Forrest. 

“Get Forrest down,” he told 
Dent-Howard. “And you get out of 
sight, too. We don’t want B.H. 
seeing himself.” 

Forrest was pulled roughly to 
the floor of the compartment, and 
Dent-Howard sprawled over him, 
holding him down. The nettles 
stung him in the mouth again, for 
good measure. He couldn’t move 
his upper body but thought it wise 
not to reveal just now that his legs 
were relatively free from the pa- 
ralysis. He couldn’t kick out any- 
way but if the Dent shifted his po- 
sition, he might be able to. It was a 
matter of waiting for the right 
moment. He didn’t want to be pre- 
mature again. 

Above the roaring of the engines 
and the storm a new sound echoed 
through the skater. It was the am- 
plified voice of B. H. Howard. 
Forrest could not see the screen, 
could only hear the voices. It was 
like listening to a conversation 
on an old blind telephone. 



STAR CROSSING 



119 




“Just a minute,” Howard was 
saying. “Oh. It’s the skater. For- 
rest is back, and Harrison is with 
him. FU call you back . Am I 
glad to see^ow? I’ve been hanging 
by my thumbs. How’s your health, 
Warner? Glad you made it, Jim.” 

The Dents made appropriate an- 
swering sounds. Forrest could only 
see the backs of their heads. The 
other Dent’s face was close to his 
own, expressionless. 

Howard cut their greetings 
short. “Time enough for talk when 
you get in. Where are you now? 
Never mind, I’ve got you, eighty- 
seven miles out. Come right in and 
go to work, all hell’s breaking 
loose. You’ll have to park on the 
ramp and walk in through the shed, 
so I can test you. Did you see any 
Dents?” 

Forrest could see his counter- 
part shaking his head. “Not a sign 
of them, B.H.” Was Howard being 
taken in? It looked like it. 

“Everybody’s asking me,” said 
Howard. “I’d sure like to know, 
one way or the other. Hold on . 
Mark here. Yes, Commander Ros- 
coe. What?” There was a long si- 
lence. “Damn the military. They 
can’t see beyond their eyeballs. 
This place is worth defending if 
anything is. You can’t get a better 
link planet than Marconi or a 
better location than Denebo- 
la . No, I’m staying here, hell or 
high water and I think I’m going 
to get both pretty soon ... Just 
until? If they can get us off, they 



can defend us . How do we know 
what the Dents are going to do? All 
the real spies are on their 
side . .Look, if I gave you some 
proof, would you? Just a minute 
. Warner, tell me; did you see 
any evfdence that there was any 
landing made, did you hear any* 
thing, see any — ” 

“Not a thing,” said Dent-Harri- 
son innocently. “All I know is what- 
Forrest told me. I was ready fot* 
them, though. Listen, why can’t 
we — ” 

“Not now,’’ said Howard. 
“Whatever it is. Hello, Roscoe? 
Isn’t the fact that the capsule 
landed somewhere enough? My 
men are back now and they haven’t 
seen anything, but that doesn’t 
mean . No, I can’t prove a damn 
thing yet . Yes, I know it would 
be an overt act ... Yes I know 
President Grulzak wants to de- 
clare war. So do I . Hello . 
Cut off.” 



T HERE was comparative si- 
lence for a few moments, 
though Forrest could hear 
Commander Howard making some 
mechanical clicking noises. 

Dent-Harrison said, “Why can’t 
we defend Nexus? I didn’t want to 
abandon it. Forrest says you might 
destroy the island. Wouldn’t it be 
better to fortify it?” 

“Too late for that,” said Com- 
mander Howard. “Never mind 
that now. Get in here at top speed. 



120 



IF 




We’re going to have to button up.” 

“You’re going to destroy the is- 
land?” asked Dent-Harrison in a 
worried voice. 

“I don’t know,” said Howard. 
“I’ll have to consult Regulus about 
that, I suppose. I get all kinds of 
advice from the stars. And I don’t 
believe in astrology . Hello, 
Regulus? No, not Director 
Bennett. I was speaking to 
Commander Roscoe. I was cut 
off. This is Howard, Commander 
Howard, Director Howard, what- 
have-you, jack-of-all-trades How- 
ard, Marconi. Hello, Roscoe. No, 
it wasn’t my fault. I never cut any- 
body off . Look, if I see any 
Dents, I’ll hit ’em first and then tell 
you about it, but I haven’t seen 
anything to shoot at yet. If there 
were some of your ships around, 
they could chase some Dents in 
here . No, I haven’t heard from 
the Lone Ranger yet, our Grand 
Home Fleet of one guard ship. 
Probably tangling with the Dents a 
light-month away.” Howard 
paused, seeming to remember 
something. 

“I wanted to ask you, shall I 
shoot missiles to destroy Nexus Is- 
land? All right, I won’t . Cer- 
tainly they can land on the water, 
but not around here. Maybe near 
Nexus, that’s the reason ... I can’t 
do any searching till this storm lets 
up. Can’t see the nose in front of 
your face with instruments ... Not 
a thing on the scope ... I have my 
own skater here on the screen, shall 



I blast it? Maybe it is Dents, how 
the hell should I know? . Cer- 
tainly, I’ll test them, before I let 
them in. What do you take me 
for? . What do you mean don’t 
be sarcastic? I can be as sarcastic 
as I want to be. You’re not my 
military commander. I’m respon- 
sible for this station and if you 
want to get the President on 
the line . Well, I thought you 
were ordering me around . Sor- 
ry, Roscoe, I got carried 
away . What do I need? More 
Dents, maybe . Goodbye. Off.” 

Dent-Harrison spoke up. “What 
did he say?” 

“No decision yet. Don’t do any- 
thing. Well, I’m doing it. They said 
not to bother hitting the island 
now. We’ll either abandon the 
whole planet, or if we reinhabit the 
island we can fumigate it. As long 
as you’re here now, Warner, it 
doesn’t matter. The whole purpose 
was to keep the Dents out of Mark 
Station. They can’t get here from 
the island now, any more than they 
can from the sea. And there might 
be peace, he thinks. Or someone 
thinks.” 

Dent-Forrest asked, “What’s the 
situation now? Strategy-wise, I 
mean.” 

Howard paused a moment be- 
fore answering. “The Dents can’t 
attack Marconi in force and 
they’re not going to try, he says. It 
has to be infiltration. Somewhere 
on this planet there’s a Dent 
capsule. After the storm, we’ll find 



STAR CROSSING 



121 




it. Right now we button up. He 
says if there was positive evidence 
of a landing, they’d call it an overt 
act and declare war. 1 wish I could 
find some evidence, but I can’t. I’m 
too honest. The Dents might be 
peaceful, after all. Then again, they 
might want to take the base 
without causing a war. They aren’t 
going to get away with that . I’ve 
got Regulus and Arcturus on 
sixteen-hour alert. If they hear 
from me, or if they don’t hear from 
me — ” He left the sentence unfin- 
ished. 

O NLY the roar of the storm 
filled the skater for a bit. For- 
rest was calculating the exact mo- 
ment to throw off the Dent, jump 
up and attract HowandVattention. 
Dent-Howard looked strong, es- 
pecially in the arms. Forrest tried 
to picture him as a tentacled polyp. 
What were its strong points? What 
were its weak points? 

“Now, tell me,’’ said the voice of 
Commander Howard. “How did it 
go? What took you so long?’’ 
“Convincing Harrison to leave,’’ 
said Dent-Forrest. 

“I could have done that in ten 
minutes,’’ said Howard. “Anyway, 
while this phone is quiet, let’s talk. 
I have some questions to ask. Uh, 
purely routine. Warner, you used 
to be quite a fan of detective fic- 
tion. In The Case of the Oil - 
Stained Gardener , who was the 
murderer?’’ 

“The author,’’ answered Dent- 



Harrison. “Why don’t you ask me 
what my great-aunt’s maiden name 

is?’’ 

“Well, what is your great-aunt’s 
maiden name?’’ 

“I don’t know. What’s the point 
of these tests? If the Dents can read 
minds — ’’ 

“They can’t read minds,” replied 
Howard. “That’s where we have 
them. No matter how they grill 
their victims, they can’t get every- 
thing out of them. So random 
questioning may trip them up. 
Jim, I have one of your books 
here. Sorry to have to pry, but I’ve 
been looking through your book- 
case — ” 

“I hope you haven’t tom my 
comic books.” Dent-Forrest 
laughed. 

“What comic books? I’ve never 
seen you with a comic book. What 
are you talking about?” 

Forrest, down on the floor, felt a 
thrill of hope. 

But the Dent laughed it away. “I 
meant my paperbounds — you 
sometimes called them comic 
books.” 

“So I did,” said Howard. “Any- 
way, here’s a book. The Life and 
Times of Claude Degler. What’s it 
about?” 

Dent-Forrest said quickly, “A 
French artist who goes to the South 
Pacific and gets his ear cut off in a 
native brawl. Sort of a historical 
novel.” 

A fluttering noise came, then a 
snap. “All right. It might be a best- 



122 



IF 




seller among the Dents for all I 
know. I can’t tell anything on TV 
anyway. I’ll test you again when 
you come in. I have a whole battery 
of tests I can use.” 

None of which will work , 
thought Forrest despondently. He 
began to tense for the job of over- 
throwing the Dent holding him 
down. Now? What was his weak 
spot? Not his arms, which were 
tentacles, really. Not his body, 
which was tough and strong. Not 
his head, which was only a dum- 
my. His mouth — If he could hit 
him in the mouth and penetrate 
deeply inside it — might make him 
uncomfortable. But Forrest 
could only move his legs. Could he 
get his foot in the Dent’s mouth? 

VII 

H E STRUGGLED silently. The 
Dent prevented him from 
shifting his position without 
hardly being aware of him. He 
supposed he was making some 
noise but it couldn’t be heard above 
the competition of the skater and 
storm. Just as Forrest thought he 
was about to get into a position 
where he could shake off the Dent, 
stand up and attract Howard’s at- 
tention, the opportunity was lost. 

The skater bumped twice, then 
rose at an angle, settled with a jar 
and stopped moving. They were on 
the ramp at Mark Island. Forrest 
struggled harder, seemed to be 
gaining at least a chance to use his 



legs. The engines stopped and the 
rain was left as background noise. 

“We’re here,” announced Dent- 
Harrison. 

“Welcome aboard,” said the 
voice of Commander Howard, on 
the TV. “Leave the skater there, 
walk up the ramp and into the 
shed. I’ll be ready for you.” 

“All right, B. H. Be seeing you,” 
said Dent-Forrest and snapped off 
the TV. 

This was an unexpected blow to 
Forrest’s chances. He slumped, ex- 
hausted and weary. How could he 
attract Howard’s attention with- 
out the TV? 

The two Dents in front were 
struggling into their raincoats. 
The door was opened. The noise of 
the rain came louder and a cool 
breeze blew in on Forrest. He felt 
Dent-Howard relax his grip — he 
must have been uncomfortable 
too — so he wormed his way into a 
more favorable position. 

Dent-Howard asked, “What’ll I 
do with Forrest?” 

Forrest could plainly see the 
smirking face of his double in the 
door light. “You can do anything 
you want with him.” 

This was the black moment to 
end all black moments. Forrest had 
hoped to plant some suspicion in B. 
H.’s mind, so that he would not let 
the Dents in. But Howard was let- 
ting them in. They would get into 
the shed, pass all the tests, enter 
the control room, chat a while, 
catch B. H. by surprise and kill 



STAR CROSSING 



123 




him. The base would be theirs, and 
the whole system it controlled. 
But first — Forrest’s own end. The 
rain drifted in as the two Dents 
stood in the doorway. Forrest 
shivered and not just from the 
cold. 

“Keep him alive,” decided Dent- 
Harrison surprisingly. “I think 
your bud needs more lessons. His 
goof about the comic books almost 
fixed us.” He turned to Dent- 
Forrest. “Let me do most of the 
talking but keep your pistol handy. 
I’ve got the grenades, if we need 
them.” 

Dent-Howard had sat up. The 
pressure was off and Forrest was 
able to move a little. He didn’t 
want to reveal that he could move 
a lot until the other two were gone. 
Dent-Howard would be tired and 
stiff, relaxing after his long or- 
deal. It was still three to one; soon 
it would be one to one. Forrest lay 
still, waiting his chance. 

Dent-Forrest walked up the 
ramp. Dent-Harrison lingered, 
gave Dent-Howard some last-min- 
ute instructions, or perhaps con- 
solations for being left out of the 
action. “It won’t take long. Watch 
him closely till we come back — or 
till we give you the word to come 
in. Don’t call us, we’ll call you.” 
And he was gone, slamming the 
door. 

Immediately, without giving the 
Dent a chance to think, Forrest 
sprang into action. 

Literally sprang. Putting all his 



strength into straightening his legs, 
he threw off the Dent and stood up 
in one swift motion. He was count- 
ing on the fact that Dent-Howard 
wasn’t up to par and that the sur- 
prise attack would prevent him 
from using his paralyzing stingers. 

Forrest found his balance, 
avoided the Dent’s groping arms 
and kicked him full in the face. The 
Dent’s mouth sagged open and he 
fell back against the wall. Forrest 
pushed one of Harrison’s bright red 
shoesox right into the Dent’s 
mouth. 

Farther and farther he pushed it, 
the Dent now sitting helplessly on 
the floor, his head back, arms wav- 
ing aimlessly. The Dent’s face was 
beginning to deform like heated 
plastic, the mouth expanding 
enough to take the whole.foot. For- 
rest stood above the Dent, jam- 
ming his foot in up to the ankle, the 
shin. The Dent seemed to be weak- 
ening rapidly. Forrest imagined he 
was doing great damage to the 
Dent’s primitive insides. He 
kicked around and his foot felt like 
it was sloshing in something 
liquid. 

Suddenly he felt the Dent go 
limp. Forrest breathed heavily a 
while, then withdrew his foot. The 
Dent slumped to the floor like an 
empty bag. Forrest stood swaying 
for a moment, then leaned against 
the corner of the skater. No cheers, 
but he had won. What now? There 
was no time to be wasted. What 
could he do?

The Dents were in the shed. He 
had to warn Howard quickly. 
What he had to do was a job for an 
acrobat. 

Balancing carefully, so he 
wouldn’t fall to the floor and have 
trouble getting up again, he 
managed to push one knee against 
the front seat, swing it back. He 
crawled into the other seat, sat 
down with a painful crash and 
groaned. Or tried to — he still 
couldn’t make his mouth work. 

He tried to lift the foot he had 
used on the Dent, but it hurt so 
much that he had to put it down. 
He lifted the other foot and 
stretched it toward the control 
panel. Don't call us, we'll call you. 

He snapped on the TV with his 
toe, leaned forward as it came on 
brightly. 

C OMMANDER HOWARD 
was looking the other way, 
peering into another TV screen, 
which apparently showed the 
interior of the shed. He was 
pressing buttons. Tape reels were 
rotating, instruments were flashing 
and humming. Tests were being 
given. Tests that would fail , as had 
all the others , thought Forrest. 

Howard must have fixed up the 
skater shed as a test room while 
Forrest was away. No doubt he 
could see the two Dents in there, 
but the expression on his face was 
merely intent, not suspicious. 
Before long he would be satisfied 
and would push the button to let 



the Dents into the main building of 
Mark Station. That would be the 
beginning of the end. But now 
Forrest was on TV and he was 
trying to make a noise. He banged 
on the panel with his good foot, 
now with both, unmindful of the 
pain. Howard, fiddling with dials 
and pushing buttons, seemed 
oblivious to the racket. 

Forrest kept up his foot-drum- 
ming, frantically, Suddenly How- 
ard frowned, turned toward him. 

Staring into the TV, Howard’s 
eyes widened. His mouth opened, 
but he made no sound. He looked 
back at the other TV, and then at 
Forrest, who could only sit there, 
trying to make some meaningful 
motion with his head, some sound 
with his mouth. He wondered what 
sort of a crazy man he looked like 
to Howard. 

Howard closed his eyes for a 
moment, then turned back to the 
other screen. A look of anger was 
now on his face, the one that For- 
rest had never seen, had only heard 
of by reputation. Howard’s face 
grew red. 

He pressed buttons, pulled 
switches and reached out for a lever 
that looked something like the 
handle and trigger of a gun. He 
looked steadily into the other TV, 
gripped the lever. Forrest heard a 
noise like the stuttering of a type- 
writer or the chattering of a ma- 
chinegun. There was a sudden 
loud explosion, then another. The 
control panel in front of Howard 



STAR CROSSING 



125 




shattered. Dust filled the air. For- 
rest could see Howard doggedly 
gripping the lever, his expression 
slowly changing from angry to de- 
termined and finally tired. He let 
go of the lever, glanced at the dam- 
aged control panel and turned to- 
ward Forrest, who was still trying 
to understand what had happened 
and was helpless to say or do any 
thing. 

Commander Howard stared an- 
grily at Forrest. “I might have 
killed my best friends, just now. 
But I don’t think so. What are^ow, 
a spare?” At this, he moved some 
levers and switches, pressed some 
more buttons, frowned in annoy- 
ance when nothing happened, hesi- 
tated a moment and grabbed for 
the gun handle again. With a last 
look of aversion at Forrest, he 
snapped off the TV. Forrest 
stared into the blank screen. 

Now he understood what had 
happened, but not all of it. The 
Dents were dead; Howard had 
gunned them down. He had no 
time to exult at this, because he 
now heard the slapping sound of 
bullets on the skater’s hull. He had 
to act at once. 

An expert skater pilot can do al- 
most anything with his feet he can 
do with his hands. Forrest started 
the engines, lifted off savagely and 
sailed straight ahead, up at a steep 
angle. He thought he would con- 
fuse Howard for a moment by 
taking off over the island, instead 
of backing up toward the sea. It 



was a hairy maneuver and Forrest 
nearly fell out of his seat — he 
couldn’t strap in — but he just made 
it over the roofs. In a few moments 
he was bowling along close to the 
waves on th$ other side of the 
island, the automatic pilot 
resuming its job. It was several 
seconds before the bullets 
commenced to follow him again. 

The island’s automatic defenses 
must have been damaged or he 
would never be getting away, For- 
rest thought. Howard was firing 
manually, obviously, with what- 
ever he could point. 

It certainly was a wonderful 
thing. In a way, he had won. Two 
of the invading Dents were dead 
and the other was dead or 
unconscious on the floor of the 
skater. The station was safe for the 
moment and he himself was still 
alive. Yet . 

Here he was, running for his life. 

F ORREST set the automatic pi- 
lot at an altitude just above the 
highest waves. The skater was 
working perfectly, for which he 
was thankful. He was also 
thankful for the storm, for a 
change. Howard seemed to be 
firing bigger and bigger stuff as 
Forrest got farther and farther 
away from the island. Oc- 
casionally the skater rocked with 
concussion as a big one hit nearby. 
It demanded every second of For- 
rest’s attention to keep changing 
his course, to avoid lapsing into a 



126 



IF 




pattern that could be predicted 
manually. 

He wondered how long the storm 
would last. Would the Dent star- 
ship return to renew it? Would the 
guard ship, or any other help, ar- 
rive? 

He thought of his friends, home- 
ward-bound on the Stardust . He 
had volunteered to stay here, 
thinking perhaps to get ahead 
where there was little competition. 
Well, he wasn’t too sorry. Maybe 
he’d get out of this. He just didn’t 
know how. 

In addition to his constant eva- 
sive action, he tried to put maxi- 
mum distance between himself and 
Mark Island, but there was no- 
where to go. Correction, there was 
one place to go on the whole 
planet — Nexus Island. Howard 
would expect him to go there. No 
doubt he would be dropping a 
missile on the island soon, 
thinking, and not incorrectly that 
it was a nest of Dents. Poor 
Harrison, if he was still alive. 

The paralysis seemed to be wear- 
ing off. Forrest could move his 
arms again and he immediately set 
about tying up the Dent, who was 
not dead but unconscious. He 
found some straps among the lug- 
gage. He improvised them into 
bonds, doing a thorough job of 
trussing up the alien. The Dent’s 
resemblance to Howard, in spite 
of the tom mouth, was remarkable. 
How did they do it? Well, here was 
a captive to work on, more 



valuable alive than dead, when or if 
he could be put into the hands of 
the scientists. He found no wea- 
pon other than a small pocket pis- 
tol, like Harrison’s. 

He returned to the pilot’s seat 
and made a futile attempt to con- 
tact Howard. The base did not re- 
spond to any signal. 

What would happen next? It all 
depended on the orders Howard re- 
ceived from Regulus, which in turn 
depended on the report Howard 
turned in. A planet swarming with 
Dents? It would look like it. 
Having failed to take over the 
station by infiltration, they could 
still try force. 

Three humans on a planet in the 
middle of Dent domain. Too bad 
they were separated. He was a 
hunted fugitive, scooting over the 
ocean. Harrison was helpless on 
Nexus Island. Howard, on Mark, 
was armed and warned, but not in 
possession of the facts. The three of 
them together could hold off an 
army of Dents. They were not 
together. 

A wall of sound hit him. The 
skater lurched, rose violently into 
the air, flipped end over end and 
sank beneath the waves. The 
engines stopped and Forrest 
thought the ship wasn’t going to 
surface, but it did. It bobbed er- 
ratically on the stormy waters. One 
of Howard’s long-rang missiles 
had scored. 

Forresfe decided to play dead for 
a while. He waited, enduring the 



STAR CROSSING 



127 




seasick motion for about ten min- 
utes. His borrowed clothing was in 
rags. He rummaged through Har- 
rison's luggage and found a slightly 
less nauseating combination. Rust 
and yellow, it was, with a hardly 
noticeable blue stripe. 

The island was the only destin- 
ation possible, after all. Once there 
he could try — if the buildings still 
existed — to contact Regulus, if he 
could rig up the radio once again, 
so that it hooked up to the gravity 
beam. Get a message to Com- 
mander Roscoe, tell him the truth 
about the enemy and the situation 
here, get Howard to stop shooting. 
It seemed like a long, impossible 
chance. He was a pilot, not a com- 
munications technician. The 
hookup that had been used before 
was a mass of junk. The odds were 
against him. But it was the only 
game in town. 

Besides, Harrison was there. 
This was an act of rescue, a mis- 
sion of mercy once more. He had 
to get Harrison off the island. 

Once again. 

He started the engines, swung 
around and was off like a bullet, 
toward Nexus Island. 

VIII 

B EFORE the navigation instru- 
ments told him otherwise he 
had begun to expect to see no 
island ahead at all. Howard had big 
missiles in his arsenal and the 
island was an artificial one, built up 



from the ocean floor. So he was a 
little surprised when he saw it 
looming darkly and lightless 
through the rain. It was three 
o'clock, not yet dawn. He zoomed 
onto the skater ramp, killing the 
engines to stop. 

Why had the island not been 
bombed? He preferred not to 
speculate on the reasons for this 
right now, finding it sufficient to 
keep in mind that it could be 
bombed any moment, so that he 
had to make haste. See what he 
could do about the radio hookup, 
rescue Harrison and clear out fast. 
Make for the other side of the 
planet, maybe, until the storm 
was over. Oh, yes — rustle up some 
food and supplies. 

He glanced back at the tied-up 
Dent and opened the door. The 
rain soaked him as he ran into the 
building. He entered the little 
kitchen belonging to Harrison. He 
walked over to the circular stair- 
case, pressed the button on the 
bannister, then impatiently 
mounted the stairs, two at a time. 

On the second floor, heMooked 
into the radio room, the lights 
coming on as he crossed the thres- 
hold. The contraption in the cor- 
ner, blackened and ruined, caught 
his eye at once and immediately 
discouraged him. How could he 
repair this thing, knowing almost 
nothing about it? How could even 
an expert fix it? He gave up the idea 
of communicating with anyone 
and left the room. He went to the 



128 



IF 




door of the storeroom. This was 
the door he had almost tried be- 
fore and Harrison — the Dent — 
had urged him to come away. 

It was locked. He had no idea 
where the key was, so he pulled out 
the Dent's little pistol, stood back 
and fired. It took four shots before 
the wrecked door swung open. 

The place really was a store- 
room, he saw when the lights came 
on. It was stacked with boxes of 
every description and many other 
things, some not even recognizable 
to him. Harrison, too, might be 
here — andwas. 



F ORREST found him at the 
end of the room, stretched out 
on a cot. He looked to be 
unconscious or sleeping. Harri- 
son — if it really were Harrison 
and not another Dent — turned over 
and suddenly sat up, blinking. 
Forrest saw that he was shackled to 
the bunk, which was fixed to the 
floor. He had been working on his 
bonds, but ineffectually, as evi- 
denced by signs of scraping on the 
metal. 

Forrest was the first to speak. 
“You’ve passed ihe blink test.” 
“Who are you?” said Harrison, 
weakly. “I don’t know you, so you 
can’t be a Dent. Dents are only 
people I know.” His mind seemed 
to be wandering and Forrest be- 
came concerned. He asked Harri- 
son if he had had the dose of Con- 
trad he had needed. 



“Oh, yes,” said Harrison. “They 
deprived me for a while to see what 
the effects, were, I suppose, then 
gave me a shot, to see what the re- 
covery effects were. They wanted 
to fool someone with a half-baked 
imitation of me. Glad to see that 
they didn’t. Did you shoot them? I 
thought I heard a lot of shooting 
going on, but I’ve lost all track of 
time. That makes me a possible 
Dent, doesn’t it? The time test, you 
know.” 

“They’re dead. Two of them 
anyway. But they did fool me.” 
He brought Harrison up to date, 
while he was working to cut the 
shackles with some tools he’d 
found in the storeroom. “So you 
had the Contrad all along? By the 
way, my name’s Jim Forrest, 
B.H.’s pilot. I keep forgetting that 
everything I told the other Harri- 
son isn’t known to you.” 

The little man smiled. 

“So Howard got them both. 
Good for him. I’ll have to talk him 
out of shooting at us,” said Harri- 
son. “He always was a stubborn 
character. Once B.H.'gets an idea, 
he carries it to extremes. Of 
course, that’s one of his good 
points, too.” 

Forrest looked up from his hack- 
saw work. “Never mind that. 
We’re going to get out of here. No 
time now to try to fix the star 
hookup. We’ll contact Howard 
after the storm is over and he’s 
cooled down a little.” 

The last link fell off and Harri-

129 




son rose shakily. “No, I’m all 
right. I’m ready to go with you, but 
let’s take a look at that radio first.’’ 
He led the way out of the store- 
room to the communications 
.room, at first limping, then with a 
firmer stride. 

He walked into the radio room, 
Forrest following. Harrison went 
over to the multiple TV screens, 
Forrest waiting by the burnt-out 
wreckage in the corner. Harrison 
turned around, looking puzzled. 
Then he caught sight of the messy 
contraption near Forrest. 

“That’s not it,’’ said Harrison. 
“That’s an old-style gravity cal- 
culator.’’ Irrelevantly Forrest 
noticed that Harrison was wearing 
an even more outlafldish outfit 
than any he’d seen, black-and- 
green dotted shirt clashing with 
red-and-yellow slacks and blue 
shoesox. 

Harrison picked up a pair of 
needle-nose pliers. A few wires 
stuck out of the jaws. 

“I just attach this to the back of 
the TV.’’ He laid down the pliers, 
fiddled with the TV knobs, got a 
dim picture. 

Forrest felt hope returning. Was 
it possible? Did the thing work? “I 
thought you said the radio was 
out?” 

Harrison flashed another of his 
grins. “I didn’t say that. Did I?” 

“No — you didn’t. But the mast 
is down, too.” 

“You’re right — the mast is 
down.” Harrison pressed a button, 



there was a whirring noise and the 
TV brightened. 

“It certainly is a wonderful 
thing,” said Forrest, not knowing 
whether to be dismayed at the 
extent of the pent lies, or jubilant. 

The picture on the screen showed 
the inside the skater. Barely visible 
behind the two empty front seats 
sat the Dent, trussed up, un- 
moving. 

“That’s all I can get right now,” 
said Harrison. “I can’t get New 
Nexus direct because of the storm. 
Who’s that? The fake Howard? I’d 
like to pulverize that creature. He 
had me fooled for a while. Made up 
a story that his plane had crashed 
in the water. I talked too much be- 
fore I found out he wasn’t Howard. 
Then I wrecked the copter, so he 
couldn’t leave the island. He 
budded another of his kind to study 
me, copy me. I have nothing 
against the Dents — did you see 
their natural form? Fascinating. 
But I don’t want them 
masquerading as us. Sure that guy 
is safe there?” 



<{W¥7E’re going out as soon 
▼ ▼ as I pick up supplies,” said 
Forrest. “Can you get that thing 
working? We might try to contact 
Regulus, at that. I’ll write out a 
message in code.” 

“Forget the code,” said Harri- 
son. “There’s nothing wrong with 
the TV.” He attached the pliers- 
like gimmick. Another screen lit 



130 



IF 




up, the view of the skater re- 
maining on the first. 

“That looks like Director 
Bennett on Regulus,” said Har- 
rison. “Hello, Cecil. You know 
me, don’t look so surprised. I’m 
not a ghost. Or a Dent either— 
don’t look at me like that.” 

Forrest saw that the communi- 
cations director’s horror was gen- 
uine. He stared at Harrison but 
addressed someone else. “Com- 
mander Roscoe. I think I’ve got 
Marconi here.” 

“Marconi?” said another voice. 
“I’ve already got Marconi. Let me 
have that.” The picture changed to 
another face, one Forrest knew 
well, that of the military com- 
mander of the Regulus area. Com- 
mander Roscoe. He looked at 
Harrison long and carefully, 
glanced at Forrest briefly. He 
winced. 

“If you’re Harrison and For- 
rest, I’m an Algieban alligator. 
What are you trying to pull? For 
your information, your first For- 
rest and your first Harrison are in 
the skater-shed at Mark Station, 
stiff as barrels. How stupid do you 
think we are? We’re not fooled by 
identical twins.” 

“Now just a minute,” said 
Harrison angrily. “I’ve had 
enough of that. It’s bad enough 
having Dents imitate me without 
being taken for one. Let me talk to 
Howard. Put me through to Mark 
Station. You can do that for me — 
even if you think I am a Dent.” 



“You want to see Howard?” The 
commander’s face hardened some 
more. “Yes, I’m sure he’ll want to 
see you. I’ve got him on the line 
now. I’ve been trying to talk him 
out of bombing Nexus Island. 
Maybe I’ll change my mind.” He 
cut off and another room filled the 
picture. 

It was the familiar interior of the 
control room at Mark Station, a 
thousand miles away, relayed via 
the stars, a trillion times that dis- 
tance. 

As soon as B.H. Howard came 
on the screen, he turned red. 
44 Roscoe, don’t try to keep me 
from bombing the island now. You 
killed my friends, you slimy polyps, 
and you’re soon going to pay for 
that.” 

“Wait a minute, B.H.,” said 
Forrest. “Aren’t you going to give 
us a fair trial before you condemn 

us?” 

Howard glared. “What kind of 
trial? No tests work. You Dents are 
too clever. I’m happy to tell you 
that war’s been declared. I’ve been 
given a free hand to wipe out any 
Dents I see. And that includes 
you.” He reached for his evidently 
repaired control panel, pushed 
buttons, set dials. 

“Hold it, Howard.” Com- 
mander Roscoe came on the 
screen again and Harrison fixed it 
so that both occupied separate 
screens. Roscoe was calmoY, at 
least by comparison. “You’re 
zeroing in on military property. 



STAR CROSSING 



131 




That island may be valuable to us 
when we bring in the forces. Can’t 
you wait for your revenge?” 

“No,” said Howard. “I’m not in 
your jurisdiction. I’ll take the re- 
sponsibility. It’s not revenge, it’s 
caution. There’s no room for 
Dents on this planet. Islands are 
expendable.” 

Forrest didn’t like the way things 
were turning out. He wished he 
had prepared to leave before 
making this contact. They had to 
get out of here right now — he tried 
to pull Harrison away. The little 
man was staring speechless at 
Howard, who was reaching for the 
button — the one that would 
release missiles already zeroed in 
on the island. 

At that moment, motion was 
seen on another screen, the one 
that showed the skater’s interior. 
The Dent had gotten loose, and 
was climbing up front toward the 
controls. He no longer looked like 
Howard — he was a gray rubber 
doll. 

Harrison connected the screens 
so that Howard and Roscoe could 
see the skater. “There’s your 
Dent — and, damn it, he’s getting 
away!” 

The others were frozen at this 
sight but Harrison sprang into 
action. He jumped for the control 
panel, pulled down a lever that 
resembled the handle of a gun. 

Up above, from the observa- 
tory, could be heard the chattering 
of gunfire. Harrison swung the 



controls of the variable cannon, 
following the now airborne skater 
on his sights. He pushed buttons in- 
creasing the firepower, but soon 
had to announce that Dent and 
skater had gotten away in the. 
storm. 

T HE incident seemed to have af- 
fected Commander Howard at 
the Mark control panel. He spoke 
to Harrison in a quieter voice than 
before. 

“Was that the last Dent? I’ll take 
cafe of him. Give me the direction 
and the exact moment he took off. 
What’s the top speed of the skater, 
Jim?” 

Forrest was dazed. “About two- 
ten, B.H.,” he replied. 

An equally mystified Harrison 
checked the angle of the gunsight, 
and Roscoe came up with an 
accurate figure for the time of the 
Dent’s departure by consulting 
the playback tape. 

Commander Howard began 
punching a desk computer. Then 
he adjusted dials on the panel, 
reached out his arm and pressed a 
button. “Now if he just doesn’t 
take too much evasive action — ” 
They watched the screen in com- 
parative silence. It takes quite a 
few minutes for a missile to go a 
thousand miles. The picture 
showed the interior of the skater, 
the gray rubber-doll figure, balloon 
head bobbing, gray arms active at 
the controls, the storm visible 
through the back windows. They 



132 



IF 




stared at the comic figure that was 
no longer funny. Suddenly they 
were looking at a blank screen. 

No one spoke for a few 
moments, while the images flashed 
back and forth across light-years. 

“It was a good skater/' said 
Forrest. 

“You’ll have a dozen more,” 
said Commander Roscoe. He 
turned to Howard. “Are you 
satisfied they’re not Dents? You 
seemed to be so certain a while 
back that they were.” 

“I’ll vouch for them,’’ said 
Howard. “It’s not what people say 
that counts, it’s what they do. You 
fired on the Dent, Warner. This 
could have been faked, of course, 
but it shook my conviction. Your 
cooperation in guiding the missile 
convinced me.” 

Howard thought a while, then 
went on. “The Dents I killed in the 
skater shed were really Dents. 
They’re some kind of primitive 
creatures underneath. So you 
must be the men they replaced. 
Anyway, it isn’t that much of a 
risk, since now you have to stay on 
the island. Commander Roscoe 
tells me that the Marines will soon 
be landing. They’ll bring doctors 
and a physical examination will 
tell all.” 

Forrest felt a mental letdown, 
after the threat of impending 
destruction had been lifted. “Let’s 
go up to observatory,” he said to 
Harrison after Howard and 
Roscoe had signed off. 



As they rose into the upper 
room, brightness met them. It was 
now after four o’clock and 
Denebola was coming up into a 
spacious sky nearly free of clouds. 

.. “I guess the weatherbomb 
finally gave out,” said Forrest. 
“There go the Dents’ chances.” 
“They may still come in force,” 
said Harrison cautiously. 

“B.H. will take care of them. He 
can easily cover Nexus, now that 
the sky is clear.” 

Harrison began tinkering with 
the instrument in the center of the 
room. “And now that the storm is 
over, I can use my telescope again. 
Have you ever seen the Sun from 
here? It’s in Aquarius. You know 
they once had a saying, that when 
the Sun is in Aquarius — ” 

“There’ll be rain,” said Forrest. 
“Where did you hear that?” 
asked Harrison. 

“From you. From your double.” 
“Damn! That guy stole my jokes 
too!” They laughed a little rustily. 

Forrest looked through the 
window at Old Nexus City. Soon it 
would be reactivated to accom- 
modate military personnel. 
Marconi would be a busy place. Of 
course this would be only a small 
part of a huge operation, the 
expedition against the Dents. 

“You’ll be sort of crowded here, 
Harrison. Do you mind?” 

“Well, I could go back to 
Earth — but I like this weather.” 
Forrest smiled. “So do I.”

I 

HE Terran Ambassador to 
Quahogg,” said the under- 
secretary solemnly, “has disap- 
peared.” 

Career Minister Magnan, seated 
opposite his chief across the wide, 
gold-plated Category 2-b VIP 
desk, cocked his narrow head in a 
look of alert incomprehension. 

“For a moment, sir,” he said, “I 
thought you said the Terran Am- 
bassador had — ha-ha — disap- 
peared.” 

“Of course I said he’s disap- 
peared,” the undersecretary 
barked. “Vanished. Dropped from 
sight.” 

“But that’s impossible,” Mag- 
nan said reasonably. 

“Are you calling me a liar — or 
an idiot?” 

“Mr. Magnan is merely 
expressing his astonishment, Mr. 
Undersecretary,” First Secretary 
Retief said in a calming tone. 
“Perhaps if -you’d give us a little 
more background it would help 
lower his credulity threshold.” 

“What background? Ambassa- 
dor Wroth wax was dispatched a 
week ago at the head of a small 
mission accredited to the Supreme 
Figuration of Quahogg. The 
party reported landing on bare 
rock in a violent whirlwind, find- 
ing no signs of the local culture, no 
vegetation, not even a building or 
the ruins of one. The members 
took shelter in a cave after being 



threatened by immense carnivor- 
ous worms. At that point Wroth- 
wax’s absence was noted. Frankly, 
we’re mystified as to what went 
awry.” The undersecretary looked 
challengingly at Magnan. 

Magnan put a finger to his 
cheek. “You don’t suppose the 
Quaswine — ” 

“Quahoggians, if you don’t 
mind, Magnan. No, out of the 
question. His Supremacy was 
most cordial during our chats via 
telelink, though a trifle shy. Never 
showed his face, possibly under- 
estimating our sophistication, 
imagining we might find his alien 
appearance off-putting. He wel- 
comed the establishment of diplo- 
matic relations, gave us landing 
coordinates, assured us he was 
laying on a gala welcoming cele- 
bration.” The undersecretary 
handed over a rather blurry color 
photo of a vast, baroquely orna- 
mented chamber. 

“The audience chamber in His 
Supremacy’s palace — splendid, 
eh, in a barbaric fashion? We lifted 
the image from the TL screen.” 

Magnan gasped. “Stunning. Just 
look at all those swags.” 

“Any exterior shots?” Retief 
inquired. 

“It seems climatic peculiarities 
render open-air photography 
somewhat impractical N on Qua- 
hogg.”' 

« W HAT does His Supre- 
▼ ▼macy have to say about 





our man's disappearance?’' Mag- 
nan wondered aloud. 

“Unfortunately our communica- 
tions link is temporarily off the 
air— due to atmospheric distur- 
bances. However, my guess is that 
the mission missed its landing 
point and came to rest in a patch of 
desert rather than the magnificent 
city pictured there.” 

“Well, I’m sure we’ll all miss 
His Excellency,” Magnan said, 
looking politely grieved. The ex- 
perience must have been quite 
harrowing for them.” 

“It still is,” the undersecretary 
said grimly. “According to their 
last transmission before we lost 
contact, they’re still holed up in 
the cave, subsisting on their 
representation rations.” 

“Six days on domestic cham- 
pagne and mummified hors 
d’oeuvres?” 

“these are the hazards a 
diplomat faces in the field,” the un- 
dersecretary said sternly. 

“The loss of Ambassador 
Wrothwax is a grave blow to the 
corps,” Magnan said. “I wonder 
who could possibly fill his slot in 
the Table of Organization.” He 
pinched his lower lip and gazed 
ceilingward. 

“Actually, Magnan, your name 
has been mentioned.” 

“What, me, sir? To be pro- 
moted to career ambassador? I 
really don’t deserve — ” 

“That’s what we thought. That’s 
why we’re merely naming you as 



charge d* affaires until Wrothwax 
is found.” 

“CAarg£?” Magnan shifted in 
his chair. “At Quahogg? My feel- 
ing, sir, is why send good men af- 
ter bad — not that I mean to imply 
anything, of course — ” 

“Someone has to go in there and 
find Wrothwax, Magnan. We 
can’t just drop an ambassador 
from the records as if he were so 
much broken crockery.” 

“No doubt, sir. I was just 
thinking of this condition of mine. 
My doctor says it’s the most un- 
usual case of aggravated diplo- 
mat’s elbow he’s ever encount- 
ered — ” 

“See here, Magnan — if you have 
any reservations about this as- 
signment — any reservations at 
all — I’m sure your resignation will 
be philosophically accepted.” 

“Oh, no — I couldn’t be more 
enthusiastic. Why, who needs 
vegetation? It just requires a lot of 
mowing and trimming and I’ve 
always loved all sorts of creepy, 
crawly, creatures. Ah — you did 
say the party was chased by giant 
worms?” *

referred to by the landing party 
as, let me see, oh yes: slugs, and 
super-slugs.* According to the 
report they’re limbless, feature- 
less, boneless, without sensory 
organs and of the approximate 
shape and consistency of bagged 
oatmeal— cooked.” 

“Cooked?” 

“1 understand they have hooks 
on their undersides to help them 
hang on when the breeze gets over 
a hundred and ninety knots,” the 
undersecretary amplified. 



66 ¥ HAVE a capital idea, Mr. 

A Undersecretary,” Magnan 
said brightly. “Why don’t we just 
skip on past Quahogg and. try our 
luck elsewhere, say in a nice, com- 
fortable planet inhabited by noth- 
ing more ferocious than a few col- 
orful lichens?” 

“Don’t talk nonsense, Magnan. 
Quahogg happens to be the sole 
planet of the Verman system, 
which lies squarely athwart the 
Groaci direction of creep into 
Terran spheres of influence. It 
should be perfectly plain to you 
that we must get a foothold on 
Quahogg before those rascals steal 
a march on us.” 

“Maybe they’ll just go around 
Quahogg.” 

“What — and lose points? Don’t 
be naive, Magnan. You know how 
important points are to the 
Groaci.” 

“I’ve got it, sir. Why don’t we 



pretend to be big-hearted and just 
let them have it?” 

“Then wed lose points. Besides, 
His Supremacy is something of 
an unknown quantity — we don’t 
know what the beggar’s up to.” 
The undersecretary frowned. 
“I’ll be candid with you: there 
seems to be some possibility that 
he has imperialistic ambitions. 
Wroth wax went in with a full Mark 
XL Undercover kit, and instruc- 
tions to poke about. From the 
promptness with which he 
vanished, I suspect His Supre- 
macy wasn’t fooled even for a mo- 
ment.” 

“About that resignation,” Mag- 
nan said thoughtfully. “Would 1 
be able to get a lump-sum settle- 
ment from the Retirement 

Fund?” 

“Negative!” the Undersecretary 
barked. “Look here, Magnan, this 
could be a millstone in your ca- 
reer. A milestone, that is to say.” 

Magnan said, “How true. What 
a pity I never learned the 
language — ” 

“Eh? According to your file you 
brain-taped both Sluggish and 
Worman back when you were 
angling for the assignment.” 

“Ah — unfortunately I only mas- 
tered Old Low Worman, an ob- 
scure dialect — ” 

“Bah, Magnan. You’re hedging. 
I want you to go in there and come 
out covered with glory. Do you 
understand?” 

“But— what about this Supreme

IF

Figuration? How do I find him 
among all these— these oversized 
annelids?” 

“That’s your problem, Magnan. 
Now, you and Retief had better 
step smartjy. The personnel ferry 
lifts in less than six hours and you 
will be aboard.” 

“I say, sir,” Magnan offered, “I 
don’t suppose you’d like to send a 
couple of gunboats in ahead of us 
to — uh — sort of worm the place a 
trifle?” 

“Nonsense, your job is to find 
out what happened to Wroth wax, 
not to become entangled with the 
wild life.” The undersecretary 
fixed the new appointees with a 
penetrating eye. “We’re counting 
bn you, gentlemen. And remem- 
ber the corps motto: come back 
with your briefcases — or on them!” 
In the corridor Magnan looked 
despairingly at Retief. 

“It simply doesn’t pay to be out- 
standing,” he mourned. “My re- 
ward for years of dazzling efficien- 
cy — exile to a worm ranch.” 

“Cheer up,” Retief consoled 
him. “I’m sure you’ll find the ex- 
perience exhilarating — once you 
get the hang of gripping bare rock 
while conducting a high-level 
negotiation with deaf mutes.” 
“There’s one consolation,” 
Magnan said, perking up a little. 
“As charge , I’ll rate a salute of 
seventeen and a half guns.” 

“Impressive,” Retief said. 
“Let’s hope they’re not aimed in 
our direction.” 



I N RETIEF’S cramped cabin 
aboard the corps’ ferry, Circum- 
spect , the intercom crackled and 
spoke. 

“Better get set, Retief,” a casual 
voice said. “We’ll be hitting at- 
mosphere in a couple of min- 
utes — and I do mean hitting. If you 
see Nervous Nellie, pass the word. 
His hutch doesn’t answer.” 

“Nellie?” Magnan frowned. “Is 
there another passenger aboard?” 
“Just a little personal code the 
captain likes to use,” Retief clari- 
fied. “I think it’s time to strap into 
the drop-capsule.” 

“I’m all a-twitter,” Magnan said 
as he and Retief made their way 
along the narrow access shaft to 
the tiny compartment in which 
they would descend to the sur- 
face. “To think that I’ll soon be 
presenting my credentials to His 
Supreme Figuration — ” 

“A solemn moment, Mr. Mag- 
nan.” 

“Garb-wise, I’m prescribing full 
Late Midafternoon Top Formal 
cutaways, with chrome-plated 
dickeys, silver lace cuff-cascades, 
plus medals and orders. First im- 
pressions are important, I al- 
ways say.” 

“I’d suggest you amend that to ' 
read full environmental suits, plus 
deflector fields and traction 
boots,” Retief said. He waved a 
hand at the small screen on which a 
cloud-mottled planetary surface- 



RETIEF, INSIDER 



139 




was slowly swelling. “There seem 
to be a dozen or so hurricanes, ty- 
phoons and tornadoes blowing 
simultaneously down there at the 
moment.” 

Magnan stared at the view in 
dismay. “We’re supposed to land 
in /Aar?” 

“Actually, this is almost a lull, 
by Quahoggian standards.” 

“You speak as though you knew 
it would be like this.” 

“The post report the preliminary 
survey team compiled mentioned 
a certain amount of turbulence 
in the atmosphere.” 

“Why didn’t you warn me? I 
could have wriggled out — I mean, 
my peculiar qualifications could 
have netted us a six-month TDY 
jaunt doing a tourist facility sur- 
vey on Beachromp, on full per 
diem allowances.” 

“Pon’t tell me that a 
campaigner of your experience 
forgot to do his research?” 

“Of course not. How would 1 
have known about the seventeen 
and a half guns?” 

“We’re in for a bumpy ride,” 
Retief, said. “Maybe you’d better 
not try to land all the booze you 
had loaded in the cargo well.” 
“Medical supplies,” Magnan 
said crisply. “As you know, I 
disapprove of stimulants except in 
emergencies.” 

“I suppose the fellows in the 
cave could use a snort, at that.” 
“Um. Foolish of them to have 
landed off-target.” 



“That part puzzles me,” Retief 
said. “The controls in these land- 
ing bugs are pre-set, you know.” 

“Possibly some malfunction,” 
Magnan said absently. “Now, I’ll 
want you to observe my technique, 
Retief. As chief of mission. I’ll be 
moving in the highest level of the 
local society, hobnobbing with 
bigwings, attending a gay round 
of routs and balls. Tedious, of 
course, but one must accept these 
trifling inconveniences as part of 
the burden of leadership.” 

“What about finding the missing 
ambassador? Will you be hand- 
ling that before or after the gay 
round — I mean the trifling incon- 
veniences?” 

“Frankly, Retief,” Magnan said 
in a confidential tone, “L imagine 
we’ll find His Excellency holed up 
in the native quarter with a pair 
of local houris. We’ll hush up the 
affair, as is usual in such cases, 
and—” 

“Ready for drop,” the captain’s 
voice rasped in the diplomats’ ear- 
phones. “Happy landings, gents— 
and look out for falling cargo.” 
With a lurch, as though kicked by 
a giant boot, the capsule leaped 
free of the mother ship and ar- 
rowed down through the murky at- 
mosphere of Quahogg. 



44/^REAT heavens, Retief,” 
VJ Magnan said, over the 
shriek of the wind, peering out 
through the armor-glass panel set

IF 




in the steel bulkhead of the tiny 
landing pod, moments after the 
cushioned impact on the surface. 
“There’s nothing out there but a lot 
of worn-down stone and flying 
dust, unless you want to count 
those ugly-looking black clouds 
scudding overhead. What’s hap- 
pened to the palace of His Supreme 
Figuration?’’ 

“The welcoming committee 
seems to be late, too.” 

“Good lord — you don’t suppose 
we blundered, coordinate-wise, 
and missed the drop area, like that 
last pack of nitwits?” 

“If so, we missed it the same dis- 
tance they did. Look over there.” 

Magnan exclaimed sharply. 
“Why— it’s a CDT landing pod 
just like ours!” 

“Except that the wind has peeled 
most of the plating off it,” Retief 
agreed. “Well, let’s get started. We 
don’t want to keep His Supremacy 
waiting.” 

Magnan assumed a determined 
expression. “I see we’re up 
against some unexpected ob- 
stacles,” he said firmly. “How- 
ever, a diplomat’s primary skill is 
adaptability.” 

“How true. What do you plan to 
do?” 

“Resign, effective last Tuesday, 
pension or no. Just thumb that 
intercom and tell the captain to 
pick me up at once, will you?’ v 

“One-way link, Mr. Magnan, 
remember? I’m afraid we’re 
stuck.” 



“You mean—” 

Retief nodded. “We might as 
well disembark and find out if that 
report of a forty-foot worm was an 
exaggeration.”* 

Magnan groaned. “Maybe, if 
we’re lucky, we can find the cave. I 
hope those gluttons haven’t eaten 
all the antipasto.” 

A WKWARD in their bulky 
protective suits, the two diplo- 
mats cycled open the exit hatch. At 
once a violent blast of air seized 
them, spun them along across a 
stretch of eroded stone to lodge 
them with a crashing impact 
against a low stony ridge. 

“So far so good,” Retief said. 
“At least the weather reports were 
accurate.” 

“A scant consolation for being 
marooned in a maelstrom — ” 

“Still, you only have to hold the 
job down for thirty days to qualify 
for full chief-of-mission pay.” 

“If I live that long.” 

“Our first move had better be to 
plant a tracer beam to mark 
ground zero before they dump any 
more welcomees off-target.” 
“Leaving clues to ease the bur- 
den of my successor interests me 
far less than preserving a whole 
skin,” Magnan snapped. “I mean 
Ambassador Wrothwax’s skin, 
of course,” he added quickly. 
“Gracious, I’m only too glad to 
hurl myself to destruction if it 
will help implement corps 
policy.” 



RETIEF, INSIDER 



141 




“That’s all right, my suit 
recorder’s not on,” Retief said. 
“And Wrothwax will be thinking 
of your skin— in strips — if you hurl 
yourself to destruction before 
you’ve found him.” 

Magnan, only dimly visible to 
Retief from six feet away, strug- 
gled to a sitting position. At that 
precise moment there was a 
descending whistle, followed by a 
resounding thump a few yards 
distant in the gloom. 

“That would be your medical 
supplies, right on schedule,” Re- 
tief said. He got to his feet, forced 
his way forward into the gale. 
“That’s a lot of medicine, Mr. 
Magnan,” he said admiringly. 
“How did you sneak it past Sup- 
ply Control?” 

“I hope the bottles aren’t 
broken.” 

“No bottles,” Retief said. “Steel 
drums, fifty-five-gallon size. Lots 
of ’em.” 

Assisted by his suit’s servo- 
boosters, Magnan waded forward 
to peer at the heaped containers 
deposited on the rock. Lettering 
on their sides proclaimed: 
TINCTURE IODINE— .01%; 
SULPHURIC ETHER, USP; 
WHITE PETROLEUM OIL 
HEAVY. 

“You had me fooled,” Retief 
said. “I thought you were just kid- 
ding about the medical kit.” 

“Who, I?” Magnan said weakly. 
“Would I jest about a subject so es- 
sential to diplomacy?” 



“Well, we’re prepared for a 
variety of emergencies,” Retief 
observed. “And I think I see the 
first one coming now.” Magnan 
looked in the direction Retief 
was pointing. From the swirling 
cloud of windborne dust came a 
two-ton mass of leathery, dun- 
colored gelatin, mist-shrouded, 
humping itself relentlessly to- 
ward the Terrans on blunt 
pseudopodia. 

WVTOU SEE? I knew they were 
1 exaggerating,” Magnan 
babbled, backing away. “It’s hard- 
ly more than eight feet long, or 
possibly twelve— and it’s not even a 
worm. It’s more of a slug and — ” 
“Let’s hope it’s a superslug, 
MDOM for short,” Retief said. “If 
not, I foresee a dim future for 
Terry-Quahogg relations.” 

Retief stepped aside as a long, 
tentacle-like member formed it- 
self at the fore end of the 
amorphous creature and groped 
toward him. Thwarted, it shifted 
direction, snatched at Magnan, 
who leaped away, was caught by 
the wind and bowled along head 
over heels into the murk. Retief 
went after him, brought him down 
with a flying tackle at the edge of a 
precipitous gully. For a moment 
the two suited figures teetered at 
the lip of the ravine; then a vicious 
gust caught them, tumbled them 
over. Giant hammer-blows 
slammed at Retief through his pro- 
tective suit as he careened down-

ward, bouncing from ledge to 
ledge to fetch up hard at the bot- 
tom. A moment later Magnan 
came skidding down, helmet- 
first, amid a clatter of dislodged 
stones. Retief caught him by the 
shoulders, dragged him back into 
the meager shelter of the over- 
hanging lip of a wind-carved 
cavern. 

“Well, thank goodness you’re 
here at last,’’ a petulant voice 
chirped in his earphones. “We’re 
almost out of anchovies!’’ 



6(1)UT this is insane,” the 
i^slight, paunchy diplomat, 
shivering in a use-stained environ- 
ment suit repeated for the fourth 
time in three minutes. “It’s ob- 
vious we’re the victims of some 
grotesque hoax—-’’ 

“Possibly if you’d seen fit to con- 
fide a trifle more detail in your re- 
port, Thrashwelt, we’d all have 
been spared no little incon- 
venience,” Magnan said acidly, 
holding out his glass. 

“I did, Mr. Magnan, I assure 
you. I TWX’ed all the details to 
Sector, with particular emphasis 
on my allergy problem. And in- 
stead of a rescue team, they send 
us two more thirsts to quench — not 
that you’re not welcome, of 
course,” he added with a strained 
smile as he poured pink cham- 
pagne. “We’re down to the ’forty- 
four — very poor year. Miserable 
bouquet and an apalling traveler.” 



The diplomats were seated on 
spindly folding chairs grouped 
around a collapsible table with 
integral lace napery and bud vase, 
crowded with dainty glasses, 
crumb-covered plates, open tins 
and crumpled paper napkins. In 
one corner of the cave were heaped 
a pile of ornately labeled empties, 
garnished with zwieback crusts, 
corks and olive pits. 

“Still, things could be worse,” a 
silvery-haired press attache contri^ 
buted in a tone of half-hearted 
optimism. “I recall hearing of a 
Cultural Mission marooned in 
the Belt for three weeks with noth- 
ing but a regulation multi- 
demoninational chapel kit to sus- 
tain them. Twenty-one days on* 
Mogen David and sacrificial 
wafers.” He wagged his head in 
commiseration as the little group 
observed a moment of sympathet- 
ic silence. 

“If only we could find the palace 
of His Supremacy,” Magnan said 
dolefully. “Suppose we sent out 
search parties in various direc- 
tions to comb the countryside.” 

“No use,” Colonel Wince, the 
military attache, stated solemnly. 
“Already done it. Boxed the com- 
pass. Nothing. Bare rock, slugs, 
drifted dust, worms, ravines, 
superslugs. Range of worn-down 
mountains in the distance. Filthy 
great clouds, dust up the kazoo — ” 

“Now, now no defeatism, 
Colonel,” Magnan wagged a 
finger. “We’re just not looking in

the right places. Think, everyone. 
Where haven’t we looked?” 

“Up the kazoon, I say,” the 
colonel muttered. “Give a man an 
enemy he can come to grips with, 
not this confounded smog bank in- 
habited by invertebrate ap- 
petites.” 

“With the exception of His Ex- 
cellency the Ambassador, all per- 
sonnel seem to be present or ac- 
counted for,” Retief said. “What 
makes you think the wild life is 
carnivorous?” 

“Why, the instant they sight us 
they come charging down, figura- 
tive jaws agape,” Thrashwelt said 
indignantly. 

“I didn’t see any eyes,” Retief 
said. “How do they sight us?” 

“Suppose we leave the zoologi- 
cal musings until later, Retief,” 
Magnan said sharply. “At the mo- 
ment the problem is how to disin- 
sinuate ourselves from this dismal 
fiasco without furthur abrasions 
to hides, egos and effectiveness re- 
ports. Now, I propose that we 
make one more try via telelink, 
hoping for a break in the weather 
— ” He broke off as the dim light 
filtering around the curve of the 
grotto faded suddenly to near total 
darkness in which the folding 
emergency chandelier suspended 
from a convenient stalagtite shed 
a wan glow on anxious faces. 

“What in the world — ” 

“It’s them,” Thrashwelt gibber- 
ed, leaping up. “They’re making 
another try — ” 



“Into the back room, men,” 
Colonel Wince barked. “Man the 
barricades.” 

Magnan yelped, “Here — what’s 
going on?” 

“Every so often one of those 
great horrid monsters comes pok- 
ing and probing in here,” a grass- 
hoppery little clerk said breath- 
lessly. “They squoosh themselves 
out thin and come groping in the 
dark, feeling for victims — ” 

He dashed away, scrambling 
through the narrow opening into 
the next cavern. 

Looking in the direction from 
which the attack was expected, 
Retief saw a bulge of darkness in- 
trude into the chamber; a foot- 
thick finger patted the walls and 
floor like a hand feeling inside a 
pocket. 

“Come along, Retief,” Magnan 
cried. “Do you want to be crushed 
to mincemeat?” 

“It seems to be feeling its way 
rather delicately,” Retief 
pointed out. “As if it were being 
careful nqt to break anything.” 

“Maybe it just doesn’t like 
pate,” Magnan croaked, backing 
away. “Retief — look out!” 

The leathery probe suddenly 
elongated, thinned, shot out to 
within a foot of Retief ’s knee. 

“Easy, Mr. Magnan,” he called, 
standing fast. “The suit will take 
plenty of strain.” 

Gingerly the pseudopod ad- 
vanced, hovered, then, with a soft 
smacking sound plastered itself 



144 



IF 




snugly against Retiefs left shin. 

“At last, a contact!” a mellow 
voice boomed inside Retiefs 
brain. “We were beginning to 
think you fellows didn’t want to 
talk.” 



III 

T SEEMS to be some sort of 
telepathic inductance,” Retief 
said. “He has to make physical 
contact to transmit.” 

“Precisely,” the soundless voice 
agreed. “By the way, my name is 
Sloonge, Minister of Internal Af- 
fairs to his Supreme Figuration. 
Ever since the arrival of Ambassa- 
dor Wrothwax, His Supremacy 
has been anxious to meet the re- 
mainder of the mission.” 

Retief passed the message along. 
“Then Wrothwax reached him 
after all,” Magnan blurted. 

“Indeed, yes,” Sloonge con- 
firmed. “He was perceptive 
enough to lie down when the others 
departed so precipitously. He 
wriggled a bit when I greeted him, 
but as soon as he completed his 
ceremonial arrival song I was 
able to convey His Supremacy’s 
invitation. At least I assume it 
was a ceremonial arrival song — a 
series of strident yelps in the 
audible range?” 

“We diplomats frequently burst 
into yelps on emotional oc- 
casions,” Retief assured the alien. 
“I take it after the ceremonies His 



Excellency went along to meet His 
Supremacy?” 

“Quite so. I hope you’ll also 
favor him with a visit.” 

“Retief — what’s going on?” 
Magnan demanded. “Why is it 
fingering your knee?” 

“It seems Wrothwax fell down 
and perforce enjoyed a nice chat 
with Minister Sloonge here, who 
conducted him to an audience with 
his boss. We’re invited to join the 
party.” 

“Do you suppose it’s safe?” 

“It’s what we came for.” 
“True,” Magnan conceded. 
“But Retief— do you suppose His 
Supremacy is of the same species 
as this, er Megadeosseomollus- 
coid?” 

“I heard, I heard.” Sloonge 
transmitted a chuckle-equivalent. 
“His Supremacy, a superslug? 
That’s quite amusing, actually. His 
Supremacy will enjoy the jape. 
And now, shall we be going?” 
“Very well. Just a moment while 
I summon my staff.” Magnan 
went to the rear of the cave and 
hallooed. The response was a stri- 
dent sibilant. 

“Quietly — you’ll tip off our 
hidaway — ” in Thrashwelt’s voice. 

“You presume to shush your im- 
mediate supervisor?” Magnan 
said sharply. “Come out at once 
and join my retinue. We’re paying 
a call on His Supremacy.” 

“Sorry, sir. My job description 
doesn’t say a thing about exotic 
forms of suicide.” 




RETIEF, INSIDER 



145 




“What’s this?” Magnan choked. 
“Mutiny? Cowardice in the social 
arena?” 

“Concern for corps property,” 
Thrashwelt corrected. “I wouldn’t 
want to lose a valuable environ- 
mental suit containing an ex- 
pensively trained bureaucrat, 
namely myself.” 

“Very well,” Magnan said 
coolly, “I suggest you while away 
the time until your arrest by com- 
posing a letter of resignation.”' 

“Better composing than decom- 
posing,” Thrashwelt said tartly. 

“Come, Retief. Since you were 
the only one cool-headed enough to 
join me in my decision to outface 
the monster well carry on un- 
aided.” 

With their helmets in place and 
servos creaking, they followed the 
giant courtier out into the gale. 

OTHING like a bracing 
stroll in the open air to 
make one appreciate a little shel- 
ter,” Sloonge commented as the 
little party slogged ahead, the two 
diplomats sheltered in the lee of 
their guide, who slithered along be- 
side them like a bus molded in gray 
jello. Communication was main- 
tained via a pair of strap-shaped 
extrusions, which the Terrans 
gripped. 

“Curious,” Magnan said, buck- 
ing the head-wind. U I see no signs 
whatever of civilization — no 
roads, fences or structures of any 
sort.” 



“Oh, erecting anything out here 
on the tundra would be a waste of 
time,” Sloonge commented. “This 
is just a pleasant zephyr, of 
course — but when the wind starts 
to blow in earnest, it’s a different 
matter.” 

“Underground shelters?” Mag- 
nan inquired. 

“What — caverns large enough to 
shelter the entire population— cut 
into solid rock?” Sloonge sounded 
surprised. “Quite beyond the,, 
scope of our technology. I’m 
afraid.” 

The party topped a rise. Through 
a momentary break in the pall of 
rolling dust a featureless plain 
was visible, stretching to a row of 
humpbacked hills. 

“Still nothing,” Magnan com- 
plained, his voice barely audible 
over the keening of the wind. 
“How much farther are we ex- 
pected to wade through this Nia- 
gara of emery dust?” 

“Not far,” Sloonge said. “We’re 
almost there.” 

“I suppose the palace is nestled 
in the hills,” Magnan muttered 
doubtfully as they forged ahead. 

Ten minutes later, after mount- 
ing a slope of drifted dust in the lee 
of a rounded promontory they 
reached a sheltered furrow in the 
lumpy ground. 

“Ah, here we are,” Sloonge tele- 
pathed, angling toward a lightless 
fold in the landscape. 

“I still don’t see anything,” 
Magnan said.

“We Quahoggians don’t lavish 
much .effort on externals,” 
Sloonge explained. “Why bother, 
when the sand would flay a coat of 
paint off in twelve seconds by the 
clock?” 

The giant creature extended an 
improvised digit the size of a 
prize-winning watermelon to 
thumb a spot on the featureless 
gray wall. A crack appeared, 
valved open on a brilliantly lit and 
wide passage. 

“Breath-taking,” Magnan 
gasped as they stepped inside the 
rose-colored passage. The howl of 
the wind died as the entry closed 
behind them, to be replaced by the 
soothing strains of a Strauss 
waltz; liveried amoeboids of 
medium size sprang forward to 
attend the newcomers. 

“You may remove your hel- 
mets, gentlemen,” Sloonge an- 
nounced. “You’ll find the air here 
tailored to your specifications, as 
suggested by Ambassador Wroth- 
wax.” 

«WHY, RETIEF, 1 don’t be- 
▼ ▼ lieve I’ve ever seen any- 
thing so lavish in scale and decor,” 
Magnan said as they proceeded 
along a lofty hall paved in red car- 
peting and draped in irridescent 
scarlet silk, shot through with 
bluish traceries. “No wonder they 
don’t bother fancying up the ex- 
ternals with all this in store.” 

“I’m exceedingly pleased you 
find the surroundings accept- 



able,” a deep, soundless voice 
seemed to boom through Retief’s 
brain. 

“Good lord! What was that?” 
Magnan quavered. 

“Gentlemen, permit me to 
introduce His Supreme Figura- 
tion,” Sloonge spoke up smoothly. 
“Your Supremacy, the newly ar- 
rived members of the Terran 
delegation.” 

“A pleasure,” the vast voice 
rumbled. “Sloonge will show you 
to your quarters. Just ask for 
whatever you’d like. As for my- 
self, I’ll have to ask you to excuse 
me for the present. A touch of 
dyspepsia, I fear.” 

Magnan was fingering his skull 
as if exploring for cracks. “I 
understood you to say contact was 
necessary!” he hissed at Sloonge. 
“How is it we can hear His Supre- 
macy when he’s not even here?” 

“Not here? Surely you jest, 
Magnan,” Sloonge said jovially. 
“Of course he’s here.” 

Magnan looked around. 
“Where?” 

“Don’t you know where you 
are?” 

Sloonge’s mental tone was 
somewhat amused. 

“Of course — we’re inside His 
Supremacy’s palace — ” 

“Close,” Retief said. “But I 
think ‘inside His Supremacy’ 
woiifd be closer; about fifty yards 
along the pharynx, on the threshold 
of the cardiac orifice, to be pre-, 
cise.” 



RETIEF/ INSIDER

44'VfOU — don’t mean we’ve 
Xbeen eaten alive?” 

“Eaten?” Sloonge laughed a 
hearty telepathic laugh. “My dear 
sir, you’d hardly constitute for a 
crumb for His Supremacy, even if 
he were capable of subsisting on 
carbon compounds.” 

“Then— what— ” 

“I think I’m beginning to get the 
idea, Mr.* Magnan,” Retief said. 
“The external environment here 
on Quahogg made development 
in that direction pretty difficult; 
so they turned to the inner man, so 
to speak.” 

“Well put, Retief,” Sloonge 
said. “I think you’ll find we live 
very well here under the protec- 
tion of His Supremacy 
“But— inside a living creature? 
It’s fantastic!” 

“As I understand human physio- 
logy, you maintain a sizable 
internal population of your own,’’ 
Sloonge said somewhat tartly. 

“Yes — but those are merely 
intestinal parasites. We diplo- 
mats are a different type of para- 
site entirely — ” 

“I hope, sir,” Sloonge said with 
a noticable chill in his tone, “that 
you harbor no groundless 
prejudice toward honest intestinal 
fauna?” 

“Gracious, no,” Magnan said 
hastily. “Actually, I couldn’t get 
along without them.” 

“To be sure. Well, then, may I 
show you around? Ahead are the 
fundus and pylorus; on my left, the 



arcade leading to the pancreas 
and spleen; I believe we’re having 
a modest chamber-music concert 
there this evening. There’ll be a 
few tables of bridge in the jejunum 
and roulette in the ileum for the 
more adventurous souls.” 

“Retief, it’s amazing,” Magnan 
murmured as they proceeded. 
“The hangings, the carpeting, the 
furnishings — they’re magnificent. 
Whoever would have thought tripe 
could be so glamorous?” 

“Your quarters; gentlemen,” 
Sloonge announced, ushering 
them through an arched opening 
into an anteroom done in a rather 
sour yellow. 

“Unfortunately the colors are a 
bit liverish at the moment, but the 
decor will improve as soon as His 
Supremacy is feeling better.” 
Sloonge opened wide doors on a 
spacious room complete with 
flowery wallpaper, luxurious beds, 
pictures on the walls, capacious 
closets containing complete 
wardrobes, and an adjoining 
chamber a-twinkle with ceramics 
and bright metal fittings. 

Magnan thumped the bed; the 
mattress seemed to be a high- 
quality inner-spring; the sheets 
were of pink silk, the blanket a 
lightweight violet wool. 

“Am I to understand His Su- 
premacy provides all this himself?” 

“Why not? Once complete con- 
trol of the metabolic processes is 
established, the rest is easy. After 
all, silk, wool, leather, ivory — are 



148 



IF 




all animal products. His Supre- 
macy simply manufactures them 
in the required sizes and shapes. 
He can, of course, duplicate any 
artifact." 

“Great heavens, Retief— there 
are even nymphs disporting them- 
selves on the shower curtain," 
Magnan marveled. “How in the 
world do they—I mean — does he 
do it?” 

“It’s really quite simple," 
Sloonge said. “Over the ages you 
Terrans have learned to manipu- 
late externals; His Supremacy 
has merely concentrated on the 
internal environment.” 

“Marvelous. I can’t wait to see 
the rest.” 

“A word of caution,” Sloonge 
said. “Certain areas are off-limits 
to guests for reasons of internal 
security. You’d find conditions be- 
yond the pyloric orifice most un- 
comfortable— and I’d recom- 
mend avoiding the trachea and 
bronchial passages. Some of our 
people like to go slumming in the 
quaint little bronchioles over that 
way, but they run the risk of having 
some unsavory character jump out 
of the dark alveolus at them. Kind- 
ly limit your explorations to the 
upper tract.” 

Magnan looked suddenly 
thoughtful. “Ah— what happens 
when His Supremacy has his 
dinner?” 

S LOONGE chuckled heartily. “I 
suppose you’re picturing your- 



self swept downstream by a sud- 
den avalance of appetizers, eh, 
Magnan? Have no fear. The living 
quarters have been evolved as a 
quite separate complex in the 
anterior wall of the gut, well out of 
traffic. In any event, His 
Supremacy only ingests at inter- 
vals of several centuries. Just be- 
tween us,” he added, “he some- 
times nibbles between meals, thus 
his present indisposition, no 
doubt. However, gluttony is its 
own punishment, as I’ve so often 
reminded him.” 

“Can’t he hear you?” Magnan 
inquired nervously, glancing at the 
ceiling. 

“His Supremacy would never 
think of eavesdropping,” Sloonge 
said. “And if he did, he’d soon be 
looking for a new staff. We treas- 
ure our privacy.” 

“What part do we parasites play 
in the internal economy?” Retief 
asked. 

“Why, we man posts in every de- 
partment from liver to lights. We 
keep tabs on the basal meta- 
bolism, monitor gland secretions, 
control the pH, take care of 
custodial services, oh, a host of 
items. Without us. His Supremacy 
would soon grind to a halt, believe 
me. 

“He seems so self-sufficient— 
with your help, of course — that 
I’m a little surprised he even con- 
sented to receive a diplomatic mis- 
sion.” 

“Frankly, His Supremacy is 



RETIEF, INSIDER 



149 




thinking of emigrating,” Sloonge 
said. 

“Emigrating? Why?” 
“Overpopulation.” 

“Really? Just what is the 
population — in terms of His 
Supremacy’s species, that is?” 
“One,” Sloonge said. “But he’s 
a hearty eater. At the present rate 
of consumption, Quahogg will be 
entirely consumed in another two 
millennia.” 

“Ah — I take it you mean the 
food supply will be consumed?” 
Magnan queried. 

“A distinction without a dif- 
ference, my dear Magnan. His 
Supremacy eats rock.” 

Magnan smiled blandly. 
“Still — I should imagine- it would 
require a very long time indeed for 
a single individual to comsume an 
entire planet with a bulk some- 
what in excess 6f that of Terra.” 
“Not when he’s a hundred miles 
long,” Sloonge said succinctly. 
“And doubles in size after each 
meal. Now, no doubt you’ll want to 
get out of those bulky suits and 
freshen up. There’ll be a reception 
in your honor in half an hour in the 
duodenum.” 

“I hope,” Magnan said as their 
host withdrew, “you noted how 
skillfully I drew him out, Retief. 
Why, he was practically bab- 
bling his life secrets to me.” 

“You got everything except the 
dinner menu,” Retief said ad- 
miringly. “And of course the 



wherabouts of Ambassador 
Wroth wax.” 

“Doubtless we’ll be accepting 
His Excellency’s congratulations 
in person shortly,” Magnan said 
as he opened the closet door. He 
clucjced and lifted out a scarlet- 
and-gold creation, heavy with 
braid, loops, knots, buttons, 
lapels, aiglettes and epaulettes. 

“Amazing,” he said. “Regula- 
tion Corps Late Early Evening 
hemi-demi-semi-informals — and 
they even got the decorations right. 
Copied from Ambassador Wroth- 
wax’s, no doubt.” 

“I didn’t know you had a figleaf 
cluster to your Doublecross of the 
Order of St Ignatz,” Retief com-' 
mented. “Congratulations, Mr. 
Magnan. That’s only awarded for 
hair-splitting at the conference 
table above and beyond the call of 
protocol, as I recall.” 

“I was able to do a trifling ser- 
vice for a certain prince, who 
proved not ungrateful,” Magnan 
said modestly. “I held out for six- 
legged bar stools and a hundred- 
foot, mink-lined, double-decker 
pool table. Since His Highness’ 
uncle was in the custom furnish- 
ings line, the family turned a tidy 
profit on the affair.” 

“May I?” Retief examined the 
sparkling gold-and-enamel decora- 
tion closely. He pressed a hidden 
catch and the central jewel sprang 
open, revealing a tiny com- 
partment filled with a fine brown 
powder.

IF 




“Interesting," Retief said. “His 
Supremacy must scan the items he 
duplicates molecule by molecule, 
including any Groaci allergy dust 
that’s incidentally included." 

“Heavens, close it at once, Re- 
tief! One grain of that and my si- 
nuses will burst into flame!" 

“I’d like to borrow this, Mr. 
Magnan." 

“Take it and welcome!" 

“To fill the gap. I’ll trade you 
my plastic-and-diamond Sunburst 
for a perfect Staff Meeting at- 
tendance record." 

“You made every meeting?" 
Magnan asked as he switched 
medals. 

“Nope, missed them all." 

“One day, Retief, you’re going 
to miss something important that 
way," Magnan said sharply. 

“Perhaps, Mr. Magnan. But I 
still like the odds." 



IV 

A HORDE of gaily capari- 
soned Quahoggians thronged 
the gaudily decorated duodenum 
when the Terrans arrived. For the 
occasion, their hosts had squeezed 
themselves into vaguely humanoid 
shapes so as to fit into variations 
of Terran diplomatic garb. Soft 
music oozed from the walls; si- 
lent-pseudopoded servitors passed 
among the guests with trays of 
glasses. Sloonge came forward to 
meet them, unrecognizable in a 



vast purple suit which threatened 
to burst at every seam. 

“Ah, there you are." He gripped 
his guests’ hands with large, jelly- 
soft members extruded for the 
purpose. “Well, how do you like 
our little gathering? Rather gay, 
eh?" 

“It’s so — so silent," Magnan 
said. “A whole room full of people 
and not a word being said." 

“Ah, an oversight, easily 
corrected. We'll whip up some 
vocal chords in a trice." Sloonge’s 
imitation eyes — large pale-violet 
spots on the blob he used for a 
head — blurred and ran together as 
he concentrated silently. 

“I’ve seen noses running," Mag- 
nan whispered to Retief as that 
member slowly flowed out across 
the Quahoggan’s face. “But not 
like that]" 

From a nearby group, a babble 
of conversation started up, at a 
barely sub-intelligible level. 
Others joined in; in half a minute, a 
high-pitched roar filled the great 
chamber like a Niagara of Small- 
talk. 

“Ah, that’s more like it, eh?" 
Sloonge verbalized in a voice like 
boiling tar. “Nothing like a few 
tribal background noises to put a 
being at ease, I always say." 

“Remarkable," Magnan said, 
accepting a proffered cocktail. 
“By the way, I haven’t yet laid eyes 
on Ambassador Wrothwax." 
He craned his neck to see over the 
crowd; noticing what he was do-

ing, the crowd instantly shrank by 
a head— in many cases, literally. 

“And now,” Sloonge said 
hurriedly, “may I present a num- 
ber of His Supremacy's court? 
They’re thrilled at the prospect of 
meeting you and — ’’ 

“Delighted," Magnan said. “By 
the way— where is His Excel- 
lency?" 

“Where is he, you say?" Sloonge 
repeated. “Yes, well, as to that — to 
be perfectly candid — not that 1 
haven’t been perfectly candid all 
along — but what I mean is, now 
I’m going to be even more 
candid — " 

“Yes?" 

“Candidly, as I say — no one 
seems to know." 

“You mean — he stepped out and 
didn’t leave word?" 

“Worse than that, Mr. Mag- 
nan. He was last seen two days 
ago. He’s gone — vanished!" 

“What, again?" Magnan’s voice 
broke. “But — look here, you can’t 
just go around losing Terran Am- 
bassadors." 

“Please — not so loud. His 
Supremacy doesn’t yet know." 

Magnan drew himself up stiffly. 
“Then, perhaps it’s time to notify 
him." 

“Impossible. It would throw 
him into a case of the sulks — do 
you know what that means?" 

' “As it happens, / do not.” 

S LOONGE threw out his tem- 
porary arms. “He turns blue; 



the walls get clammy; utilities are 
shot to hell and the food—" The 
minister shuddered, an effect like 
a ripple in a bathtub full of guava 
jelly. “No, no far better we simply 
carry on quietly; he’ll never know 
the difference." 

“Impossible, Mr. Minister," 
Magnan said firmly. “I must 
request the use of your facilities to 
notify the undersecretary at 
once." 

“Unfortunately," Sloonge said, 
“that will not be possible." 

“I wondered at the rather 
curious failure of communica- 
tions due to a storm which, it now 
appears, is actually a spell of mild 
weather,’’ Magnan snapped. 
“Very well; my associate and I 
shall be forced to adopt sterner 
measures." 

“Why not accept the situation, 
gentlemen? His Excellency is 
missing, alas. But that’s no reason 
we shouldn’t continue on amicable 
terms—" 

“We are leaving," Magnan said, 
“at once." 

”Au contraire” Sloonge said. 
He had absent-mindedly slumped 
halfway back to his normal 
proportions and now resembled a 
gaudily dressed two-armed giant 
squid. “You mustn’t think of 
venturing forth in such weather." 

“Is that a threat?" Magnan 
choked. 

“By no means, Mr. Magnan. A 
simple statement of fact. For you 
to leave now might lead to all man-

IF 




ner of complications inter- 
planetary -accord wise — especially 
if you rushed back to your 
superiors with the report that His 
Supremacy has misplaced an 
Ambassador. Ergo— you remain. 
Now, let us be happy, let us be gay. 
You may as well; unless His 
Excellency turns up, you’ll spend 
the rest of your natural lives here.” 



ffOETIEF, this is fantastic,” 

-■^Magnan said as soon as 
Sloonge had flowed and wobbled 
out of earshot. “How could 
Wroth wax have vanished without 
leaving a trace? He had full XL 
gear, dye markers, radio-active 
tracers, gamma-ray projectors, 
supersonic and infrared signal 
projectors — everything.” 

“Unless Sloonge can lie 
telepathically, he’s just as puzzled 
as we are,” Retief said. 

Magnan mopped at his forehead 
with a scented tissue. “I must be 
running a fever. I wonder how 
His Supremacy is at synthesizing 
antibiotics?” 

“It’s not a fever,” Retief said. 
“It’s getting warm in here. Must be 
close to ninety.” 

All around, the restive crowd — 
which had diplomatically kept its 
distance since the exchange with 
Sloonge — was showing signs of 
distress, shedding bulky costumes 
as their quasi-human forms wav- 
ered and slumped. 

“You don’t suppose this is a 



scheme for getting rid of us by 
cooking us to death?” Magnan 
panted, fanning himself with a 
hand. 

“They don’t seem to like it any 
better than we do,” Retief pointed 
out. “They’re spreading them- 
selves thin for maximum radiating 
surface.” 

Sloonge pushed through the 
increasingly amorphous crowd; 
only the big blue eyes remained of 
the courtesy shape he had as- 
sumed. Two small, leathery-look- 
ing Quahoggans were at his heels. 

“What’s going on here, 
Sloonge?” Magnan demanded 
before the official could speak. 
“The place is like a hot-house!” 

“What’s going on is that the 
temperature is zooming toward 
a record high,” Sloonge replied 
somewhat hysterically. “His Su- 
premacy has taken a turn for the 
worse: he’s running a fever — and if 
a miracle doesn’t happen we’ll all 
be dead by morning!” 

Magnan grabbed Retief ’s arm. 
“We’ve got to get out of here at 
once.” 

“Nothing has changed,” 
Sloonge spoke up quickly. “I still 
can’t permit you to leave.” He 
motioned with a formless arm to 
his enforcers. “Take them to their 
quarters,” he ordered in a blurry 
thought wave. “Leave that they 
don’t see. I mean see that they 
don’t see. I mean see that they 
don’t leave. Or is that what I 
mean — ” 



RETIEF, INSIDER 



•153 




“Retief," Magnan said in a stage 
whisper, “you take the one on the 
left and the one on the right — and 
rilgo for help." 

One of the small beings 
produced a chrome-plated power 
gun, identical with Terran Navy 
issue. 

“Better play it smart, big boy," 
he telepathed. “I been wanting to 
see how this worked." 

F LANKED by their escort, the 
Terrans made their way across 
the wide floor— which was now an 
unflattering shade of puce and 
tended to ripple underfoot — and 
along the somewhat shrunken cor- 
ridor to their quarters. The wall- 
paper, formerly a gay pattern of 
daffodils on a field vert, was now a 
rancid orange against faded olive 
drab. The shine was gone from the 
fixtures. The heat was intense. 

“Even the mattress sags,” 
Magnan said. “Good lord, Retief, 
are we doomed to spend our re- 
maining hours in a third-rate hotel 
room?" 

Retief was watching the two 
guards, whose shapes were waver- 
ing like dying flames. He stepped 
in suddenly, plucked the gun from 
flaccid fingers which had sagged 
to a length of eighteen inches under 
the weight of the weapon. The 
former owner made a weak grab. 

“Don’t try it,” Retief advised. 
“It shoots fire. A short burst into 
th£ floor is guaranteed to give His 
Supremacy instant ulcers.” 



“Why didn’t you warn a fellow?” 
the Quahoggian said. “I might of 
shot at you, missed and gotten 
into a lot of trouble." 

“Before you go," Retief said, 
“where is the little round Terry 
who arrived last week?" 

“Beats me. I ‘ain't seen him 
since—" He caught himself, but 
the faint thought leaked through: 
since / caught him trying to sneak 
past post number eight-O-two . : . 

“Where’s post eight-O-two?" 

“I’m not saying." The guard was 
in obvious distress from the heat; 
it was apparent that only will 
power kept his lumpy body from 
flowing out into a thin film. 

“Let’s get outa here, Whump," 
his comrade proposed. “Maybe if 
we beat if out inta the exoderm we 
can cool off.” 

“Yeah, but we got orders—” 

“It’s every phagocyte for 
himself.” The first guard fled, 
closely followed by his partner. 

Magnan sniffled. “One en- 
counters them everywhere nowa- 
days — " He broke off as Retief 
pocketed the gun and headed for 
the door. 

“Let’s go hunt up Sloonge,” 
Retief said. “Maybe now he’ll be 
in a mood to negotiate.” 

T HEY found 'the Interior Mini- 
ster slumped, quivering, in a 
corner of the ilium like a truck- 
load of 'pale liver on which two 
large eyes floated like broken blue 
eggs. 



154 IF 




“What, still alive?” he tele- 
pathed weakly as he caught sight 
of the Terrans. “A pity, all this. 
Never intended it to end this way. 
His Supremacy is done for — tem- 
perature up to a hundred and ten 
and rising. This is the end — for all 
of us — ” 

“Maybe not,” Retief said. 
“What’s the quickest way out?” 
“No use. His Supremacy has slid 
into rigor vitalis; every sphincter’s 
locked tight. We’re trapped.” 

“And you intend to just lie there 
supinely and let it happen?” 
Magnan yelped. 

“It’s as good a place to lie 
supinely as any,” Sloonge pointed 
out. 

“You say His Supremacy is 
doomed,” Retief said. “Are you 
willing to take extreme measures 
on the off-chance of saving him?” 
“What do you have in mind?” 
“Can you lead the way to the ol- 
factory cavity?” 

“I suppose so — but — ” 

“No time to talk now,” Retief 
said. “Let’s get going.” 

Sloonge pulled himself to- 
gether. “I suppose anything’s 
worth a try. The olfactory cavity, 
you say? Not that it will do any 
good. You can’t get out that way; 
nostrils are closed tight, as I said, 
and — ” His thoughts trailed off as 
he devoted total effort to wob- 
bling across the now spotty-look- 
ing floor. Unconscious Quahog- 
gians lay everywhere; the few who 
retained consciousness lay 



quivering, their color like unbaked 
dough. The party made its way 
along the deserted pharynx, 
turned left into the nasal passage, 
a poorly lighted corridor 
decorated with No Smoking signs 
and enlarged photos of glamorous 
nude bacteria. 

“Little — cooler here,” Sloonge 
managed. “But — no difference in 
the end. Trapped. Sorry about this, 
gentlemen. Should have — let you 
save yourselves — ” 

They emerged into a high-domed 
chamber almost filled with banks 
of leathery curtains which hung in 
rows, quivering faintly. 

“The olfactory membranes?” 
Retief asked. 

“Correct. As you see, every- 
thing’s shut tight. Nothing can get 
through; dust-proof, wind-proof—” 

“Unless we can persuade His 
Supremacy to open up,” Retief 
said. 

“I tried,” Sloonge said, collaps- 
ing into a rubbery heap. “But he’s 
delirious. He thinks he’s a mere 
grub again and is being roasted 
and dipped into molten chocolate 
for the exotic tidbits trade.” 

“For sale to the CDT catering 
service, no doubt,” Magnan 
groaned. “Hurry up, Retief— burn 
a hole through to the outer air 
before my bodily juices coagu- 
late!” 

“Retief — you wouldn’t—” 

Sloonge made a convulsive grab 
for the Terran, who stepped back 
out of range. 



RETIEF, INSIDER

“Not unless I have to." 

“You tricked me/' Sloonge 
wailed. “Alas, that I should play a 
part in torturing His Supremacy 
in his last moments!" 

“Listen, Sloonge, I need your 
help," Retief said. “How far above 
ground level are we here?" 

“Mmm. About fifty feet, I 
should say. But — " 

“Can you elongate to that 
length?" 

“Easily. But—" 

“You'll need a solid anchor at 
this end. How about grabbing a 
few of those." He pointed to a 
stand of wrist-thick sensory spines 
lining the central aisle. 

“Why should I?" 

“Because if you don’t ill have to 
burn our way out." 

“Well—" Sloonge followed 
instructions, coiled himself like a 
pale fire-hose, gripping the sup- 
port. 

“Lie flat and hang on, Mr. Mag- 
nan," Retief instructed his col- 
league. 

“What are you going to do?" 

“Trigger a reflex — I hope." 
Retief said. “Hold your nose." He 
detached the borrowed medal 
from his chest, opened it and 
emptied the contents in a brown- 
ish cloud over the nearest sensi- 
tive membrane. 

The result was remarkable. The 
curtain-like tissue turned flaming 
red, twitched, writhed, sending the 
powder billowing about among 
the adjacent sensors, which in 



turn jerked and blushed. Retief 
dived for a position just above 
Magnan as, with a violent spasm, 
the nostril — a forty-foot vertical 
slit at the far end of the 
room— opened to admit a blaze of 
daylight and a great squall of cold 
air, snapping shut at once. 

“That’s one ‘ah,’" Retief called. 
Again the shudder, the quick in- 
take, the snap shut. 

“Two." 

A third violent inhalation . 

“Sloonge — get set!" 

The end wall split. “Go," Retief 
said. 

The aft end of the boa-shaped 
Quahoggian slithered quickly for- 
ward, out, down out of sight. 

“Come on!" Retief and Magnan 
dashed for daylight; without 
urging, Magnan gripped the leg- 
thick rope and slid down. Retief 
followed, was halfway to the 
windswept rock below when the 
thunderous choo! blasted forth 
like a quarry explosion; he fell the 
rest of the way amid coils of 
rubbery Interior Minister Sloonge.

himself back into his normal 
superslug form. “But to what end? 
With His Supremacy gone, we few 
survivors will be back to scratch-

it: a million years of evolution shot 
overnight." 

“We’re not through yet, 
Sloonge," Retief said. “Can you

lead the way back to where you 
found us?” 

“Abandon His Supreme Fi- 
guration in his dying agonies? 
Look here, Retief, you said some- 
thing about trying to save him — ” 

“That’s right. I don’t guarantee 
results, but at this stage it won’t 
hurt to try desperate measures. 
Let’s go.” 

It took the little party half an 
hour to grope across the plain 
through the relentless wind to the 
abandoned landing pod and the 
heaped drums. At Retief’s direc- 
tion, Sloonge shaped himself' into 
a large, hollow bulb with a slim 
nozzle at one end. Retief un- 
capped half a dozen of the con- 
tainers. 

“All right, Sloonge, load up,” he 
directed. The bulky interior 
minister insterted his small end 
into the nearest drum, with a 
powerful muscular contraction 
siphoned out the contents. Quick- 
ly he repeated the performance 
with the other containers. After 
the forth he was swollen to a vast 
drum-tight bulk. 

“Retief,” he telepathed faintly. 
“Are you sure you know what 
you’re doing?” 

“I hope so. Let’s get started 
back.” 

It was a painful progress. Laden 
with the sloshing bulk cargo, 
Sloonge moved heavily, clumsily, 
crawling over each bump and ridge 
with telepathic groans and moans. 
At last the range of hills that was 



His Supremacy loomed out of the 
driven smog. 

“Now— one last trick,” Retief 
said. “You’ll have to force an en- 
try into the buccal cavity.” 

“Impossible,” Sloonge expostu- 
lated. “How can I open a hurri- 
cane-proof mouth?” 

“Just far enough to get a finger 
in,” Retief urged. 

Sloonge dragged himself across 
to the sealed, fifty-foot wide eating 
mouth, probed fruitlessly at the 
sealed orifice. 

“I’ll have to use a touch of the 
quirt,” Retief said. “Get ready.” 
He set the blaster at low heat, 
aimed it at the monstrous lip, and 
pressed the stud. For a moment, 
nothing happened; then the stony- 
looking hide twitched; for an in- 
stant an opening appeared. 

Sloonge plunged his syringe-tip 
through as the mouth clamped 
tight again. 

“That— that smarts,” he said. 
“Now what?” 

“Pump it in,” Retief said. “Then 
we’ll just stand back and wait.” 

With a powerful contraction of 
his versatile body, Sloonge 
squirted two hundred and twenty 
gallons of high-grade medicinal 
mineral oil into the alimentary 
canal of his mother country. 

A GALA crowd filled the new- 
ly decorated ballroom.

to the Fatherland — sparkled, 
waved genially at the Terran Mis- 
sion as it was announced. 

“Ah, there, Mr. Ambassador." 
He hurried to offer impromptu 
hands to all members of the dele- 
gation simultaneously. “You’re 
looking quite your old self again 
after your ordeal." 

“Ordeal? What ordeal?" Wroth- 
wax boomed, deftly lifting a glass 
from a passing tray. “Nonsense, 
my boy. I had a capital time ex- 
ploring the palace catacombs." He 
snared a slab of pate from another 
tray. “1 must confess I did get a 
trifle weary of maraschino cher- 
ries; had no rations but my emer- 
gency cocktail kit, you under- 
stand." 

“Oh? I had an idea you might 
have been, er, lost." 

“Nothing in it, Sloonge. Jolly 
interesting place, the catacombs. 1 
was just on the point of deciphering 
a number of fascinating inscrip- 
tions when the earthquake oc- 
curred." 

“You wouldn’t have been snoop- 
ing just a tiny bit?” Sloonge 
inquired archly, wagging a limp 
cucumber-sized finger at the 
Terran envoy. 

“Scholarly research, my boy, 
nothing more.” Wrothwax reas- 
sured his host, signaling for a refill. 
“Pity to abandon my finds, but 1 
felt I should rush back and see to 
the safety of my staff." 

“In this case,” Magnan mur- 



murred, “I’m sure excretion was 
the better part of valor." 

“Eh?" Wrothwax said. “For a 
moment I thought you said— but 
never mind. Slip of the tongue, 
eh?" 

“No doubt." 

“Quite. Pity I never got to meet 
His Supremacy, Sloonge — but 
I’m sure you and I can come to an 
agreement regarding the exten- 
sive deposits of pure corundum- 
rubies and emeralds to you, gen- 
tlemen — among which I found my- 
self after the avalanche. Now, I 
had in mind a barter arrangement 
under which I found myself after 
the avalanche. Now, I had in mind 
a barter arrangement under which 
Corps bottoms haul in Groaci 
sand, for which you say you have 
a need, and take away these trou- 
blesome gems — waste-products, I 
believe you called them ..." 

The Ambassador and the 
minister strolled off, deep in 
negotiation. 

Magnan commented, “Never a 
word of gratitude to me for ar- 
ranging his evacuation from the 
danger zone." 

“Still, for once a Terry Am- 
bassador got inside the problem," 
Retief said. 

“And as a result of my 
efforts — with your assistance, of 
course, Retief — emerged covered 
with, if not glory, rubies and 
emeralds." 

“And smelling like a rose,” 
Retief agreed. •

It was not his time, place or kind

REVOLUTIONARY WAR 
soldier and a tramp sat eating 
lunch in the Rocket Room Lounge 
atop the Reed-Warren Hotel in 
Manhattan. 

“Now Casey,” said the tramp, 
“explain this thing to me. A week 
ago we ate garbage, if anything, 
and smoked cigar butts in corncob 
pipes. But today — ” 

“Today,” said the Revolution- 
ary War soldier, “we eat lobster, 
flown in from Maine, at the 
poshest spot in New York.” 

“Yes,” said the tramp. “And 
you’re wearing that outlandish 
outfit and carrying a bloody big 
musket. You look daft, Casey.” 
“Daft I look.” said Casey, “and 
daft I feel, but there’s moneyin the 
pockets of this silly costume. Or 
gold, anyway.” 

“You’ve got gold in your pock- 
ets?” 

“Yes, but it spends as well as any 
money you ever saw.” 

“Tell me what’s happened to 
make you this way, daft and rich.” 
The Revolutionary War soldier 
laid his musket across the table 
and lit a fifty-cent cigar. “I’ve 
brought you here to tell you, but I 
hesitate. You’ll not believe me.” 
“Please, Casey,” said the tramp. 
“I’m most curious.” 

“Okay. Well, it started a week 
ago today when I went to the post 
office to pick up my relief check. 
Another envelope was there for me, 
one with a smeary postmark so I 
couldn’t tell where it came from.” 



“And what was in the envelope, 
Casey?” 

“My orders. I’m being trans- 
ferred to the Revolutionary War.” 
Casey took a puff on his cigar. 

“That’s remarkable,” said the 
tramp. “But not easy to believe. 
What did the letter in the envelope 
say?” 

“Read it yourself,” said Casey, 
taking the letter from his three-cor- 
nered hat and handing it to the 
tramp. 

“You know I can’t read,” said 
the tramp. 

“Then I shall oblige you,” said 
Casey, putting on his Benjamin 
Franklin glasses. “ ‘Dear Casey,’ 
it says here. Through error you 
have been stranded in the twentieth 
century when you should have 
been in the American Colonial 
Period.; You will be resupplied and 
transferred this week and will 
arrive in the American Colonial 
Period during the Revolutionary 
War. Please stand by and accept 
our apologies for putting you into 
a field for which you are totally un- 
prepared.’ ” 

“That’s all?” asked the tramp. 

“That’s all,” said Casey. 

“And what happened next?” 

“I thought it foolishness and 
kept the letter only as a curiosity. 
But when I woke up the next 
morning I found these fine buckle 
shoes under my bed in the flop 
house. I felt silly but I put ’em on 
because my own shoes were gone.” 

“Amazing,” said the tramp. 




160 



IF 




“A marvelous thing,” said 
Casey. “Of course, when I got back 
to the flop that night this three- 
cornered hat was on my bed. I 
thought some of the boys were 
puttin’ me on.’’ 

“Was that it?’’ said the tramp. 
“Were some of them putting you 

on?’’ 

“No. Next morning my pants 
were gone and I found these knee- 
britches and silk hose hanging on 
the doorknob. The next day came 
this sissy-looking ruffled shirt 
and the coat,’’ said Casey. 

“How’d you get up enough nerve 
to wear such a getup outside the 
house?’’ said the tramp. 

“I had to wear it. My own stuff 
was gone.’’ 

“Still, you’re sure it’s not some- 
one playing a trick on you? You 
know, stealing your clothes and 
giving you these?’’ 

“No chance. 1 know because day 
before yesterday 1 found gold in 
my pockets. Now who would leave 
that?’’ 

“Nobody we know, I guess.’’ 



“And the horse. You know, the 
one we rode over here on? I found 
him saddled and parked between 
a Buick and a garbage truck 
yesterday morning when I came 
out of the flop. 1 knew right off he 
was mine.’’ 

“And he’s a nice horse, Casey, a 
really fine horse.’’ 

“I know nothing about horses, 
but he’s handsome all right. And I 
can ride him well enough*— and I 
was never on a horse before in my 
life. Can’t think how I came by 
it— the skill to ride, 1 mean.’’ 

“So you’re going back to the Re- 
volution,” mused the tramp. 
“Damn — that’s hard to believe. 
How’ll you get there?” 

“I can’t say, but I’m certain I’m 
going. I haven’t a doubt. In fact, I 
expect to leave today. It’s been a 
week since I got the letter.” 

“Right. The letter said a week.” 
“Yes.” 

“You’ll be missed around here, 
you know.” 

“Oh, and I’ll miss this city too, 
and my friends,” said Casey. “But

I really am a misfit. I don't like be- 
ing a bum, really, for all its ad- 
vantages. I’ve often felt that time 
and I were out of joint somehow.” 

“Perhaps you’ll do better back in 
the Revolution. Perhaps you’ll be 
a success.” 

“Well, I hope so. I mean. I’m 
dressed as a fine soldier — maybe 
an officer even.” Casey called 
attention to his uniform by 
pulling his vest smartly down. 

“And you have a good gun 
there.” 

“Tielman at the hock shop offer- 
ed me three-hundred for it, and 
you know how close he comes to 
true value.” 

“Ha!” said the tramp. “He 
never comes near it.” ~ 

T HERE was a silence. The 
tramp and the Revolutionary 
War soldier looked at each other. 

“We’ve been through a bit to- 
gether,” said the soldier. 

“We have,” said the tramp. 

“I wish you were coming with 
me,” said the soldier. 

“And I,” said the tramp. “It’s 
difficult to catch a ride on a freight 
anymore. Been figuring I’m slow- 
ing down. This life’s no fun.” 

“Yes, but I can’t take you. I 
don’t even know how I’m going 
myself.” 

“I think you’re going now,” said 
the tramp. “Look at your gun.” 
“Hey! It’s fading away. Look!” 
The musket disappeared from 
the table. 



Casey sat up straight and put 
down his cigar. He patted his chest 
and felt his shoulders. “I seem solid 
enough,” he said. 

“Not to me,” said the tramp. 
“You’re fading out. I can almost 
see through you to your chair.” 
“Really now? Well — I guess I’m 
going. I guess this is it.” 

“Yes. I could read a newspaper 
through you now.” 

“Ha! You can’t read.” 

“True, but you’re getting mighty 
faint.” 

“And I feel faint now. Do you 
suppose this is happening to the 
horse?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Well, old friend, goodbye.” 
“Before you go — one thing, 
Casey.” 

“Hurry— I feel myself slipping.” 
“Leave some gold to pay for the 
meal. I’m broke.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Casey. He pulled 
a handful of gold coins from his 
pocket and shoved them across the 
table. “You keep whatever’s left. 
I’m going. So long — ” 

“Goodbye, Casey.” The tramp 
waved briefly as the Revolutionary 
War soldier disappeared. “I hope 
your luck’s better in your new as- 
signment.” 

The tramp stuffed the gold into 
his pocket. He looked at the chair 
Casey had been sitting in, shook 
his head as if to clear it. He picked 
up the butt of the cigar Casey had 
been smoking and went to pay the 
check. •

IF 





M OST of the science fiction I 
see today is obviously deriva- 
tive from stories I saw decades ago. 
I suppose I should expect this. 
After all, the field has been mined 
steadily for almost half a century 
by clever idea-hunters; it isn’t 
surprising that most of the major 
original ideas have been discovered 
and used. 

It is more than a hundred years 
since Achille Eyraud told of using a 
rocket ship to reach another world. 
“Doc” Smith wrote the pioneer 
space opera before there were sci- 
ence-fiction magazines. Wells gave 
us time travel; his War of the 
Worlds not only invented alien 
invasion but also set much of the 



style for disaster novels later done 
to death by Wyndham, Ballard and 
a host of others. Weinbaum taught 
us that aliens must be truly 
different in backgrounds, attitudes 
and instincts. I can’t remember 
who first wrote of atomic power or 
atomic doom. 

Maybe we shouldn’t expect any- 
thing but derivative stories. In 
most writing courses, original style 
is exalted and original ideas are 
forgotten, since mainstream 
novels have to be endless varia- 
tions on familiar themes. Until 
people change radically, stories 
about them in our normal milieu 
cannot afford to use the unusual 
without losing conviction. 



163 




Nothing is necessarily inferior 
about a derivative story, even in 
our field. Many wonderful ideas 
first came to us in pretty crude 
stories with no extensive develop- 
ment. Later writers could then re- 
examine the concepts with clearer 
and deeper perception and write 
far better stories around them. 
Murray Leinster used the old idea 
of first alien contact so well that 
his novelette became the definitive 
one on the subject. He gave us 
fresh insight, which is often 
claimed but all too seldom 
achieved. 

However, the real joy of science 
fiction to its devoted readers has 
been that it is a literature of ideas. 
Unlike other fictioneers, we have 
continually discovered new con- 
cepts and eventually have thought 
out clearly all the implications of 
those concepts. If we are to re- 
main more than a minor subcate- 
gory of fiction, we continue to 
need those flashes of invention and 
insight desperately. 

Happily, lights are still burning 
where busy minds refuse to ac- 
cept sterility or senescence. 



Ringworld , by Larry Niven 
(Ballantine, 95<t), is a fine example 
of a writer’s thinking deeply and 
constructively about an idea of 
real science. 

Niven has taken the concept pre- 
sented by Freman Dyson and 
thought hard and well about how it 



could be handled. Dyson proposed 
that a race may progress until it 
needs every bit of energy put out by 
its sun; to catch that energy, it will 
take all the planetary matter and 
build it into a sphere around the 
sun, with life spreading over the 
inner surface of this sphere. 

Niven has discarded the need- 
less hypothesis of artificial gravity 
to hold objects down to that sur- 
face. He has set out to discover a 
practical way to create room for 
an expanding population. A 
sphere cannot be spun to create an 
inertial equivalent of gravity, since 
only the equator spins properly; 
and if you get up a huge ring 
around the sun, the atmosphere 
would simply stream off into 
space at the speed of rotation the 
ring would need. 

Niven has solved the problem 
neatly and to my mind com- 
pletely. It’s a beautiful concept, 
far more convincing than the Dy- 
son spheres. (Curiously, however, 
astronomers have found some evi- 
dence suggesting possible Dyson 
spheres in space. Discovering 
Niven ringworlds would be far 
more difficult.) 

Furthermore, Niven hasn’t 
stopped with a technical gimmick. 
He has looked at the effects of the 
creation of such a world on the 
race that might build it. And he has 
explored the world and its wonders 
in quite convincing detail. 

There’s a great deal more to the 
story than the technical material. 



164 



IF 




of course. There’s a subplot in- 
volving what might be called a sort 
of “psi” mutation — a human be- 
ing who always has exactly the luck 
she needs. Because of this talent 
she has been deliberately included 
in the party that will explore the 
Ringworld. But the results of her 
luck are not at all obvious— and 
Niven has thought this through as 
carefully and as originally as his 
background. 

She makes for an interesting 
character in the book. So does an 
alien who comes from a highly 
aggressive culture. The alien is 
handled with a subtlety and finesse 
that I haven’t previously seen in 
Niven’s writing; his growth to- 
ward understanding and true co- 
operation is never described in raw 
terms but is built beautifully into 
the patterns of behavior he con- 
sistently exhibits. 

The whole book marks a major 
step forward in Niven’s writing, in 
my opinion. The human view- 
point character still has some ele- 
ments that seem a bit wooden, and 
the plot doesn’t always move for- 
ward with the smoothest pacing. 
But these are minor quibbles. And 
even in these areas, I find a con- 
siderable growth in Niven as a 
writer. 

I think it’s a darned good book. 
In fact, of the science fiction I’ve 
seen so far this year, I can’t think 
of a better contender for the Hugo 
and Nebula awards. 

I hope it will be as widely read 
as it deserves. 



Q UITE different in nature is 
The Stone God Awakens , by 
Philip Jose Farmer (Ace, 750). 
This is an example of a highly 
familiar idea. Twenty-five years 
ago, Beyer’s Minions of the Moon 
began with about the same situa- 
tion — one that was old then. A 
man from today is somehow put 
into suspended animation and 
wakes in the far future when every- 
thing civilized has long since 
passed away. 

Farmer, however, hardly ever 
touches an idea without bringing 
fresh insight to it. He hasn’t 
merely destroyed civilization a 
few thousand years from now. He 
has jumped his hero forward 
twenty million years and has 
destroyed the human race after a 
tremendous background of pro- 
gress. He has then produced a 
whole series of sentient beings, dif- 
ferent from man in some ways, 
with whom our hero must learn to 
live. And above all lies a single, 
dominant sentient being that 
bears no resemblance to humanity 
—though it is a logical product of 
human progress. This is a vegeta- 
ble, computerlike thing which has 
taken over most of what is left of 
our continent. 

The period of suspended anima- 
tion isn’t exactly a simple and con- 
venient dodge to get Ulysses Sing- 
ing Bear into the future, either. He 
has been infinitely indestructible 
and immutable during all those 
eons and has been mixed up in the

developments as a “stone god” or 
unchanging object sent hither and 
thither across the savage or 
semicivilized worlds behind the 
future in which he finds himself. 

This is essentially the story of his 
search for a mate in the apparent- 
ly mateless world, though his 
immediate job is to prove that he’s 
a skookum god by overcoming 
the power of another god. Farmer 
has a trick of mixing what is ob- 
vious to the reader with nice de- 
velopments that are not pre- 
dictable. And his non-humans mix 
in complicated ways, as they 
should in a world where more than 
one sentient race exists. 

I assume this is the first of a 
series, since the ending is left wide 
open for the further exploits of 
Ulysses. But Farmer does sew up 
his primary problem in this novel, 
so that the book can stand on its 
own, unlike too many lately that 
simply stop after a certain num- 
ber of pages. 

This isn’t a major novel. It isn’t 
meant to be anything but deriva- 
tive in nature. And that doesn’t 
matter, because Farmer has done 
his homework well; he has thought 
out those twenty thousand 
millennia, he has created the rich- 
ness of background needed — and 
he has faced the human problem 
of his hero honestly. It is a book of 
insight. 

Good fun with a few kickers 
buried in it, and well worth the 
price and reading time. 



When the writer has neither a 
new idea nor any new insight into 
handling the concept, he may still 
sell a book — if his name is, say 
A.E. Van Vogt. Here is a writer 
who has long been recognized as 
having contributed a wild plethora 
of ideas in story after story, so 
that his name is genuinely and un- 
derstandably provocative of intel- 
lectual excitement. 

His Children of Tomorrow (Ace, 
950), however, is pretty thin fare. 
Instead of working or thoroughly 
reworking one idea, he seems to 
have taken two old ones, thrown 
them together helter-skelter, and 
hoped vaguely that some good 
would come fortuitously. The 
result is something like taking 
left-over hamburger and choco- 
late pie and putting them in a 
blender in hopes of getting a fresh 
dinner. 

The first element is that an alien 
race is studying the world, pre- 
paring to take it over, with one of 
its number disguised as a human 
being. This should be a good idea 
for a Van Vogt story, given suf- 
ficient new insights into the alien 
ways of thought. The second idea 
is a humdrum concept of the 
children organizing themselves 
into state-recognized bands to 
bring themselves up without the 
mistakes of their elders. 

Unfortunately, the alien boy in 
the story never seems to be other 
than a duller version of the rest of 
the kids, while his “father” ob- 



166 



IF 




server is merely a vagueness over 
the story, not at all realized in the 
way so many of Van Vogt’s aliens 
have been. The outside menace be- 
comes petty, mere window dress- 
ing. 

The wonder children fail miser- 
ably. They don’t even equal the real 
examples of such attempts to 
escape the past one reads about in 
today’s newspapers. Van Vogt’s 
kid groups aren’t cleared of the 
ancient ugliness of the tribal heri- 
tage, but seem to be rather sorry 
gangs in a stiff make-believe game 
of Junior Marvel Assistants. 
Their morality seems rather 
weaker, despite their stated aims, 
than that of some real kid gangs I 
have known. 

Apparently, one of their fathers 
should be the example of a recalci- 
trant man unwilling to adapt, 
while the mother is the sympathetic 
one. I felt repelled by her idiocy 
throughout, and the only figure 1 
could even faintly like was the 
father, until he turned into anoth- 
er patsy. 

I finished the book with grow- 
ing reluctance — but only because 
I was unwilling to judge a Van 
Vogt novel without reading it to 
the bitter end. The whole wasn’t 
worth the trouble. I regret that, 
since I think the field badly needs 
some of the magic and excitement 
that this major writer gave it so 
often in the past. It’s a shame, but I 
can only recommend that you 
pass this one by. 



T HERE are a couple of nonfic- 
tion books, however, which 
should not be overlooked. 

The Glass Teat , by Harlan Elli- 
son (Ace, $1.23), has little to do 
with science fiction, except that 
Ellison has become a major and 
controversial figure to those of us 
who read the field or who have met 
him at various conferences. It is a 
collection of his writings for The 
Los Angeles Free Press , ostensibly 
as television reviewer but actually 
as critic at large. 

It doesn’t matter what these 
treatises are supposed to be, any 
more than it matters whether you 
agree with his opinions or not. 
What does matter to me is that 
here for the first time I find some 
feeling of Harlan Ellison, the 
whole man, telling it as he sees it, 
far more than he can do in his 
fiction. And I also find a man 
writing at his most effective best. 

Anyone who has enjoyed the 
stories by Ellison should read this. 
Or, lacking its presence on the 
bookstand, wait for the next 
collection of columns soon to be 
brought out. Here is a writer who 
has been leading a crusade to 
make science fiction more perti- 
nent tp today; this book is his view 
of the today in need of such 
pertinence. 

The book also happens to be 
very much alive and fascinating 
and, from my experience with Elli- 
son, honest. The fact that it is the 
best writing of his I have yet seen is

an added bonus. I glanced at it, to 
put the book down only when I’d 
read to the end. I’m glad that he 
wrote the columns, that they were 
collected here and that I had a 
chance to read them. 



The other non-fiction book is 
directly concerned with science 
fiction. The Universe Makers , by 
Donald 'Wollheim (Harper & 
Row, $4.95), is, to quote part of the 
blurb: “an excellent personal 
statement of the place of science 
fiction in literature, an excellent 
introduction to the genre for the 
beginner, and a source of dis- 
cussion for the aficionado.” For 
once, I have no quarrel 'with the 
blurb. 

Wollheim seems to have two 
basic ideas. The first deals with the 
importance of science fiction (in 
its totality, not specifically) in 
predicting the course and hope of 
civilization or the dooms that may 
befall man. He indicates his own 
belief that science fiction has not 
only often indicated the path of 
the future before it came about, 
but that the literature has even 
helped to shape that future. Cer- 
tainly, he shows, it has greatly 
helped its readers to prepare them- 
selves to accept or cope with the 
future. 

His second theme is an attempt 
to find the main patterns in the 
field. He finds that most of the 
fiction can be separated into two 



main streams: those who follow 
Jules Verne, dealing with technol- 
ogy and gadgets, with little moral 
value and much fantasy adventure; 
and those who follow H.G. Wells, 
dealing with technology only as it 
affects the sociological future of 
man, warning of dangers and off- 
ering considered hopes for our sur- 
vival. 

In following his two themes, 
Wollheim discusses the work of 
most of the major writers who have 
written what might be called 
science fiction, whether in the 
magazines or in the mainstream. 
He is unusually frank, at least for 
a man who must deal with many of 
those writers; and I found his 
opinions stimulating and interest- 
ing, though I couldn’t always 
wholly agree with them. 

I wish more of the men who have 
spent their lives in being in- 
fluential in the field would state 
their personal philosophies of 
science fiction in books like this 
one. We’ve already lost some of 
them, but John Campbell, Robert 
Lowndes, and a number of others 
could well put between hard 
covers some of the things they have 
said in letters to their writers 
and — partially — in scattered 

writing on the subject. It is from 
such work as this that literary re- 
searchers of the future will be 
most willing to assess us as a 
literary movement of the time. 

There is nothing new about the 
idea of memoirs and musings from 



168 



IF 




influential men; it's an ancient 
form of writing, too often reserved 
for the military man and the 
politician. But since a man cannot 
live for years in any chosen voca- 
tion without developing insights 
that reflect a great deal of hard 
thought, it is writing that will al- 
ways serve us well. 

Finally, there is an anthology 
which relates coincidentally to 
some of the things discussed by 
Wollheim and also has more of 
an honest reason than many I have 
seen lately. Nightmare Age , edited 
by Frederik Pohl (Ballantine, 95c) 
gives us a choice of thirteen 
Wellsian stories which point out fu- 
tures that might come to pass, their 
cause — and sometimes, inferen- 
tial^, their cure. 

I have no desire to discuss thir- 
teen separate stories in this space. 
Sufficient to say that the works 
run from Paul Ehrlich to Robert 
Heinlein, with a lot of good sci- 
ence-fiction writers in between. 
Most of them are very good stories. 
I can’t say that I remember them 
all with pleasure — but I can say 
that I’m glad 1 read them back 
when many of them foreshadowed 
what we realize today may be the 
future, and I’m glad to see them 
assembled here. 

If there is such a thing as Woll- 
heim’s Wellsian stream of science 
fiction, this anthology represents 
some of the best and most varied 
samples of that genre. It’s a very 
good job. •

GERARD REJSKIND 



SPACE SLICK 




Man had cleaned up Earth , 
but polluted the stars . 



I 

T 'HE glowing ball of Jupiter 
should have dominated the cor- 
ner of space into which Jon Math- 
er was gazing. But he could not see 
it at all. Only a dim diffused light 
filtered through the porthole of 
the spacecraft. The Santa Bar- 
bara was orbiting more than a 
million miles from the turbulent 
surface of the giant planet and Ju- 
piter should have loomed ten 
times as large as the Moon seen 
from Earth. 

Heavy black droplets floated 
outside the ship. They were round 
and dense in the zero gravity, 
barely illuminated by the light 
reflected from the hiddea, planet. 
And the greenish-yellow Jovian 
glow grew weaker still as the drop- 
lets began to collect on the out- 
side of the porthole. Within a few 
minutes Jon Mather could see 
only his own distorted reflection 
in the glass. 

Disappointed, he removed the 
telephoto lens from his camera 
and turned to hail the Santa Bar- 
bara s chief navigator, who was 
just then floating forward 
through the craft’s all but empty 
passenger section. 

“Not much of a view,” he said. 
“Not much of anything,” said 
the navigator. “We’ve lost radio 
communication, too.” Jon raised 
an eyebrow. “It’s no surprise, 
Jon. Not with all that fuel hanging 
out there.’’ 



“You mean even radio waves 
won’t travel through this muck?” 
“Oh, they’ll travel through it just 
fine — once they get off the trans- 
mitting antenna. But the fuel con- 
ducts r.f. current, and it’s short- 
ing out our antenna.” 

“You mean we’re in trouble?” 
“Probably not. We won’t be 
running into very heavy space traf- 
fic around Callisto. And the Cal- 
listo control tower will be watch- 
ing us on radar even if we can’t talk 
with them.” 

Jon glanced at the obscured 
porthole, shook his head sadly, 
turned back to the navigator. “I 
hope you didn’t arrange the voy- 
age through this fuel slick for my 
benefit.” 

“Crazy we’re not. Though you 
did come here to find a way to 
clean up this kind of mess, didn’t 
you?” A red light flashed on at the 
front of the cabin. “I’d better get 
back to my post — we’ll be touch- 
ing down soon.” 

Jon turned his attention back to 
the fouled porthole. It remained 
as dark as before. Presently he 
felt the acceleration of the Santa 
Barbara's rockets as the space- 
craft began its descent toward Ju- 
piter’s second largest satellite. 



A S he stepped from the airlock 
of the Santa Barbara onto the 
frozen surface of Callisto, Jon 
Mather tried to twist his head to 
see the huge planet whose image 



172 



IF 




had been obscured from the space- 
craft. But the heavy life-support 
suit made the maneuver almost 
impossible and he was able to see 
nothing more than a reflection of 
the yellow globe on the curved sur- 
face of his face mask. 

Frustrated in his second attempt 
to see Jupiter, Jon glanced back 
at the ship he had just left. It was 
difficult to recognize under its 
heavy layer of grime and even by 
the light of the sun, high in the Cal- 
listo sky, he could not make out 
the logo of the Solar Federation, 
which he knew was painted on its 
hull. 

The first navigator's voice 
sounded in Jon's headphones. “It 
was a lot filthier than that. Our de- 
scent through the atmosphere 
cleaned off some of the guck." 

“How could you see to touch 
down through this stuff?" Jon 
asked. “I was blind on my side." 

. “Automatic vapor cleaner for 
the control ports. We activated it 
once we left the slick." 

Jon nodded, though he knew the 
gesture was not visible outside the 
life-support suit. In a few mo- 
ments he and the navigator had 
reached the airlock of the under- 
ground compound. A door slid 
shut behind Jon and the crewman 
and the automatic elevator be- 
gan its slow descent. A faint mist 
formed on Jon’s space mask as 
normal air filtered into the cabin. 
The door opened again, and he 
found himself in an antechamber 



that seemed identical to ones he 
had seen on the Moon. 

The ship’s navigator helped Jon 
off with his bulky helmet and the 
unwieldy gloves. Then a guide in a 
turquoise uniform bearing the in- 
signia of the Terran Mining Cor- 
poration, led him down long cor- 
ridors to his quarters. 

Once alone in his small but com- 
fortable looking room, Jon was 
quick to remove the rest of the 
life-support suit and don the light 
clothes he had packed for what 
would be entirely an indoor ex- 
istence. 

A light rap came at the door. 

“Come in," Jon said. 

The door opened and a fair- 
haired man in his late twenties or 
early thirties strode in. 

“Ralph Lake!" Jon reached for 
the younger man’s hand. "For 
God’s sake — it’s been, what, ten 
years?" 

“All of that," said Ralph. “We 
were still Earthlubbers then, 
working for the Solar Federation.” 

'‘What do you mean, Earthlub- 
bers? You went with me on my first 
space flight?" 

The younger man’s brow 
knitted, cleared. He grinned. 

“The Moon hardly counts these 
days. But you’re right — we flew to 
the Mining Engineering Con- 
gress on the Moon." 

“And I remember how rough 
that first flight was. Ships are a lot 
smoother now." 

“I hear,’’ said Ralph, “that 



SPACE SUCK 



173 




you’ve made yourself an impres- 
sive reputation on Mother Earth — 
cleaning up the home land.” 

Jon nodded. “It must have been 
shortly after the last time we saw 
each other that I was appointed 
to head the commission to curb 
the pollution problem.” 

“It was a problem,” said Ralph. 
“I remember the last time I saw 
Earth. The lake near the spaceport 
looked like an oil dump and I could 
probably have walked on it. Do 
you know the last thought I had of 
Earth as the ship lifted off?” 
“What?” 

“That at least we still had the 
means of getting above the blan- 
ket of smog that covered the plan- 
et.” 

J ON Mather was silent for sever- 
al moments. “It really was cov- 
ering the entire planet,” he said 
finally. “By the eighties all 
cities — the smaller ones as well as 
the metropolitan giants — had 
their own layer of what we were 
calling permasmog— a layer so 
thick that even the prevailing 
winds couldn’t blow it away. But 
there was worse. At upper atmos- 
pheric levels, the blankets of pollu- 
tion from individual cities were 
joining together to form a con- 
tinuous layer. By nineteen-ninety 
the upper-layer permasmog ef- 
fectively covered the planet. 
Even over the poles the stars were 
dim through the dirt.” 

“I remember,’’ said Ralph. 



“That was about the time I left.” 
Jon continued: “Trouble was, 
not only the stars were dimmed. 
Our Sun was, too. In nineteen- 
ninety New York City was an 
average four Fahrenheits cooler 
than it had been twenty years 
earlier. Extrapolate figures like 
that and it’s not difficult to see 
where you’re headed.” 

“An ice age?” 

“Right. Oh, it would have taken 
a number of years more of this 
madness for the glaciers to move 
down across North America and 
Central Europe. But it was com- 
mg. 

“I remember reading some of 
the predictions before I left, but 
I wasn’t sure I should believe 
them. They sounded like fiction.” 
“Science fiction,” said Jon, “is 
often as good as prophecy. But 
something worse than just cold 
was coming. And it would have 
come sooner. The atmosphere 
was changing. Again nineteen- 
ninety — a crucial year — the oxy- 
gen content of the troposphere 
was only eighteen percent, a drop 
of three percentage points in 
twenty years.” 

Ralph’s eyebrows shot up. 

“The effects were already 
evident. For years, the incidence 
of respiratory diseases had been 
skyrocketing because of the pol- 
lution. Now, without enough oxy- 
gen, the sufferers were having an 
even more difficult time. People 
who might have lingered for years 



174 



IF 




with their ailments were dying of 
complications. Medically, the at- 
mosphere had the reverse effect of 
an oxygen tent." 

“As 1 recall," said Ralph, “at 
the time I left Earth, many busi- 
ness buildings already had oxy- 
gen supply boosters installed in 
their air-conditioning systems." 

“After a while even some homes 
had them," said Jon. “Oh, the in- 
dustries that had created the dis- 
ease were quick enough to come up 
with certain cures— especially 
those from which more money 
could be made. Oxygen boosters 
were already in production be- 
fore the situation became criti- 
cal. They began marketing on 
Earth the same chemical oxygen 
regenerators they're using here on 
Callisto." 

“After I left Earth," said Ralph, 
“I took a job on Mars, supervis- 
ing the installation of oxygen re- 
generators. Mars was more 
pleasant than Callisto. In the mid- 
dle of a summer day you could go 
walking with only a coat and an 
oxygen mask. Aside from the mask 
and the terrible dryness of the air, 
it wasn't much worse than a cool 
Spring day on Earth. But I re- 
member thinking that some day I 
might go back to Earth — and find 
it like Mars." 

“That's where Earth headed," 
said Jon, “though she would have 
kept a denser atmosphere than 
Mars even without oxygen. But 
there would have come a 



time— maybe within two dec- 
ades— when you would have 
packed that oxygen mask to come 
home." 



44¥¥/HY was the situation so 
▼ ▼ bad?" asked Ralph. “It’s 
a good thirty years since gov- 
ernment started to do something 
about pollution. 

“They didn’t do enough. They 
managed to slow the rate of pollu- 
tion some, but not enough to pre- 
vent permasmog. Man and his 
machines were using up more 
than old Earth could give. There 
were programs to plant trees. But 
we've estimated that for every tree 
planted by a conservationist a 
lumberjack was clearing one and 
a half acres of trees. And worse, 
the seas were dying. Fact is that the 
algae and other marine plants are 
the major producer of Earth’s pre- 
cious oxygen supply. Kill them 
and not even the biggest refor- 
estation program you can de- 
vise will prevent the atmosphere 
from becoming Marslike. Yet the 
algae were dying as the oceans be- 
came a dumping ground for all our 
most undesirable wastes — while 
we abused their resources. We felt 
the oceans were too big for us to 
dirty or hurt by misuse. 

Ralph laughed without mirth. 
“We’re now thinking the same 
thing about space," he said. “Talk 
to Terran Mining about the acci- 
dental dumping of fuel into outer 



SPACE SLICK 



175 




space and they’ll tell you that it’s a 
drop in a big bucket.” 

“I intend to tell them that a lot 
of small drops make a bucketful.” 
“They won’t listen to you, Jon. 
Here on Callisto — and on Gany- 
mede — everybody lives under- 
ground and on artificial air. The 
situation’s different. They’ll ig- 
nore all the Earth-type horror 
stories you can tell them.” 

Jon thought for a few moments. 
“I’ll have to try,” he said finally. 
“That’s why I’m here on Callisto, 
to see the Terran Mining brass. I’ll 
also talk to their Industrial Stand- 
ards Officer, who’s responsible 
for keeping pollution down.” 
“Terran Mining won’t listen 
even to their own ISO.” _ 

“I’ll still see him and try to get 
the seriousness of the problem 
across to him.” 

The silence hung long and heavy. 
A full minute ticked by before 
Ralph looked up. 

“Jon,” he said softly, “I’m the 
Industrial Standards Officer.” 

II 

T HE time was almost eight 
o’clock by the artificial twen- 
ty-four hour day that was a conven- 
tion at the Callisto compound. 
The real Callisto day was more 
than two weeks long and was 
marked at midday by a solar 
eclipse, as the huge master planet 
hid the distant Sun. 

Jon Mather was sitting in the 



compound dining room, trying 
to shell a soft-boiled egg. And he 
was finding that carelessly 
gouged pieces of eggshell tended 
to fly about in the light gravity. 

Next to him, Ralph Lake 
chuckled as a chunk of egg struck 
Jon in the eyes. 

“You’ll find that a lot better in 
your mouth,” he said. 

“Damn planet.” Jon swore with 
more feeling than astronomical 
accuracy. “This is worse than the 
Moon.” 

“A little,’’ Ralph conceded. 
“What do you weigh?” 

“Last time I was in a sane place, 
about one-seventy.” 

“Here,” said Jon, “you weigh 
•only seventeen pounds — eleven 
pounds less than on the Moon.” 
“Well,” said Jon, poking at the 
egg with renewed care, “it was 
worse on the spacecraft.” 

“Just think how much worse it 
would be on Jupiter itself. Down 
there you’d weigh — ” he made a 
rapid mental calculation — “a 
little better than four hundred 
and forty pounds.” 

“I don’t think I’ll go.” 

Ralph glanced up at the digital 
clock on the dining room wall. 
“About an hour until the meet- 
ing,” he said. 

“Anything you can tell me about 
the people I’ll be seeing?” 

“Well, let’s see— you’ll be 
meeting Harris, the Terran Min- 
ing VP for Callisto. He’s the one 
who does the talking. He’ll be af- 



176 



IF 




fable as can be, provided you don’t 
suggest the company spend 
money. But if you’re going to ac- 
complish anything you’ll have to 
get through to Peters, who has a 
tendency to say nothing, en- 
couraging or otherwise.” 

“What’s Peters’ position?” 
“Liaison officer with Earth 
headquarters,” said Ralph. “If 
anything gets properly recom- 
mended to the top men it’ll have to 
pass through his hands.” 

“And you’ll be at the meeting, 
too?” 

“Yes, and on their side of the 
table. I’ll be in charge of convinc- 
ing you that we really are doing 
something to prevent space 
slicks.” 

“And are you?” 

“Just count the slicks in orbit,” 
said Ralph. “Then you tell me.” 
“Then you think they’re going to 
be difficult to deal with.” 

“Oh, they’ll be polite,” said 
Ralph, “until you mention some- 
thing expensive.” 

R ALPH LAKE had been right, 
about the politeness at least. 
Ron Harris was a large, affable 
man with a tendency to chuckle 
easily, if somewhat insincerely, 
each time he removed the large 
cigar from his mouth. 

Dirk Peters, the Earth liaison 
man, remained tight-lipped after 
the mandatory greetings, but 
Ron Harris was solicitous. 

“I hear,” he told Jon, “that your 



ship hit the Chedabucto fuel slick 
on the way here.” 

“Chedabucto?” 

“The slick was left there by the 
supertanker Chedabucto three 
years ago,” Ralph put in. “We 
name each slick after the space- 
craft responsible.” 

Harris glared at Ralph briefly, 
evidently not too fond of the word 
responsible. He switched the grin 
back on for Jon’s benefit. 

“Your pilot really should have 
raised our control tower and let us 
plot your approach to Callisto. 
We find we have no trouble avoid- 
ing the slicks.” 

Jon leafed through a sheaf of 
papers he was holding, then with- 
drew one sheet. 

“It says here that the Cheda- 
bucto slick has a diameter of 
forty-five miles.” 

“Right,” said Harris. “Needle in 
a haystack.” 

“The needle takes up about 
thirty-six thousand cubic miles in 
this case.” 

Harris took a long slow pull 
from his cigar, released a column 
of smoke toward the ceiling. “An 
awfully big haystack, too.” He 
looked at Jon through half-closed 
eyes. “You’ll get used to the scale 
of space.” 

Jon turned his attention again to 
the sheet he was holding. 

“According to the official re- 
port,” he said, “The Chedabucto, 
bound for Callisto prbit with 
sixty-three million liters of Type C 



SPACE SLICK 



177 




fuel, was struck by a small aster- 
oid, unnumbered, twelve million 
miles beyond the orbit of Mars/' 

Harris turned around to look at 
his Industrial Standards Officer. 
Ralph nodded. “That would be 
about right." 

“But that means the accident 
took place more than a quarter of a 
billion miles from here," Jon said. 

From his corner Ralph nodded 
again. “The Chedabucto was on an 
accurate glide path for the rende- 
vous orbit with Callisto. Even af- 
ter the breakup of the ship, the 
fuel slick conserved the momen- 
tum of the ship itself and came in 
for a perfect meeting with Callis- 
to.” 

“Not perfect," Harris hastened 
to add. “The Chedabucto slick is 
a good thirty thousand miles off 
Callisto." 

Jon fell silent. He made some 
unhurried notations on a second 
sheet of paper. Presently he looked 
up. 

“I understand Ganymede wasn't 
so lucky. They got hit by — " he 
glanced down again — “the Cere- 
bus slick.” 

Harris shrugged, not taking the 
cigar from his mouth. 

“Suppose," said Jon, “that the 
Chedabucto had been aimed to 
miss Callisto, with the goal of ap- 
plying a corrective maneuver at 
the last moment. That way a 
crackup in deep space wouldn't 
leave a fuel slick near an inhabited 
body." 



Harris seemed displeased, and 
once more glanced at Ralph Lake. 
Ralph remained silent and for the 
first time Dirk Peters joined the 
discussion. 

“Mr. Mather," he said, “I don't 
think you quite appreciate the 
economics of our situation. A 
tanker loaded with seventy kilo- 
tons of fuel weighs nothing at all 
in space. However it conserves its 
full terrestrial inertia. I believe 
that's correct Mr. Lake?" 

Ralph nodded without enthusi- 
asm. 

“The tanker's job is to deliver 
fuel, not burn it up," continued 
Peters. “With the enormous mass 
of fuel involved we are con- 
strained to make correctional 
maneuvers as early as possible in 
order to keep them small. Other- 
wise we burn far more fuel. And in 
that case the fuel we're delivering 
will be much more expensive." 

No one spoke for some 
moments. Finally Harris re- 
moved the cigar from his mouth. 

“The blunt fact is this, Mr. 
Mather," he said. “If we pay a lot 
more for Type C fuel, then Earth 
will pay a lot more for its copper, 
nickel, and iron." 

T HE next time Jon Mather saw 
one of the giant orbiting fuel 
slicks, it was from a respectable 
distance of a hundred miles. 
Through the porthole of the fresh- 
ly scrubbed Santa Barbara the 
slick was a translucent, almost 



178 



* IF 




black, smudge against the growing 
yellow sphere of Jupiter. The 
slick looked perfectly round, like 
a glassy planet. 

“That’s the Liberia slick,’’ said 
Ralph from the aisle seat. “It’s 
smaller than average. It came 
here four years ago, when one of 
the older tankers sprang a major 
leak and broke up.’’ 

“I hope we won’t be flying 
through this one,’’ said Jon, eyeing 
first his camera bag, then Jupiter. 

“This is as close as we’ll come,’’ 
said Ralph. “Callisto control cal- 
culated our orbit this time.’’ He 
paused before adding: “Inci- 
dentally, it’s only thanks to a good 
friend of mine at Callisto control 
that we’re getting this close to a 
slick. Harris and Peters would put 
my ears in orbit if they knew I’d 
maneuvered this little sight-see- 
ing tour.’’ 

Jon rubbed his chin with his 
hand. “That slick is taking up far 
more space than it did in the tank- 
er,’’ he said thoughtfully. “But 
even after four years it hasn’t ex- 
panded very much. I would have 
expected the droplets to go on 
dispersing, as an oil slick does on 
water.’’ 

“Trouble is,’’ said Ralph, “space 
has no currents to scatter pol- 
lutants as the sea has. And there is 
probably electrical attraction 
among the particles, keeping 
them from drifting too far from 
each other. That would explain the 
roundness of the slicks.’’ 



“That would mean,’’ said Jon, 
“that a space slick would behave 
as though it were a low-density 
solid.’’ 

He looked out once more at the 
ghostly new satellite of Jupiter. 



A BOUT four hours later Jon 
, Mather had once more fitted 
the telephoto lens on his camera 
and was aiming it out of the port- 
hole. The giant planet was close 
enough for him to see clearly the 
movement of the stormy equatori- 
al bands as they roamed restlessly 
over the huge surface. He aimed 
the small reflex camera; the crys- 
tal shutter tripped all but sound- 
lessly. 

“Just imagine that’s a basket- 
ball,’’ said Ralph from beside him. 
“Then imagine a marble next to it. 
That would be Earth.’’ 

Jon took a second picture, 
swinging the camera toward the 
Great Red Spot, just coming into 
view at the corner of the planet. 
“The sheer size of it,’’ he said, 
“makes you realize how fast 
those winds must be moving.’’ 
“That’s at least a two hundred- 
mile gale,’’ said Ralph. “Surface 
velocity — if Jupiter had a surface.’’ 
“No surface? What about those 
artists’ concepts of what the 
Jupiter landscape looks like?’’ 

“I know — they make it look like 
a cloudy Moon,’’ said Ralph. “But 
Jupiter isn’t dense enough to be 
that rocky. It has a quarter of 



SPACE SLICK 



179 




Earth's density and well under half 
the Moon's." 

“Could it be hollow?" 

Ralph shook his head. “The 
moment of inertia isn't right for a 
hollow body, nor is the gravity. 
The planet is mostly light gases, 
like hydrogen and helium. The 
pressure increases massively as 
you enter the atmosphere and 
when .it reaches about a million 
Earth atmospheres, hydrogen acts 
like a metal. We’re used to having 
a sharp boundary between atmo- 
sphere and ground, which we call 
the ‘surface.’ But every body 
doesn’t have one.” 

“Strange planet." 

“That’s the odd thing," said 
Ralph. “Jupiter isn't abnormal 
planet. It seems to be a star that 
didn’t contract enough to build up 
the heat needed to ignite thermo- 
nuclear reactions.” 

“You mean it’s a cold star?” 
“Not as cold as you’d suppose. 
Jupiter radiates twice as much 
heat as it receives from the Sun. 
On Ganymede, where we’re head- 
ed, it’s not in the sunlight that it's 
warmest, it’s on the side facing 
Jupiter.” 

“Then the base is on the side of 
Ganymede that looks toward Ju- 
piter.” 

“No. It’s on the side away from 
Jupiter. The cold , is the least of 
our problems on Ganymede.” 

G ANYMEDE was clearly visi- 
ble through the porthole of the 



Santa Barbara now. Jon Mather 
was taking more souvenir pic- 
tures when Ralph Lake tapped his 
shoulder and pointed away from 
the approaching satellite. 

“There," he said. 

Jon looked and saw his first 
supertanker. 

The Santa Barbara was still 
more than fifteen miles from the 
orbiting tanker but the latter's 
gargantuan proportions were al- 
ready impressive. The long cyl- 
indrical body stretched through 
space, longer than sixty football 
fields. At the head was a stubbier 
section from which lights glowed. 

“That front part is the com- 
mand cabin," said Ralph, pointing 
to the head of the giant arrow. 
“It's detachable so that the crew 
can use it to get home in case of a 
disaster. That’s why the crew of 
only one supertanker has been 
lost.” 

Jon’s eyes roved down the 
immense latticework of the tank- 
er’s girderlike body. Sensing his 
interest, Ralph continued his 
description. 

“That's the Torrey Cliff \ which 
arrived off Ganymede about a 
week ago. It looks about three- 
quarters full.” He pointed to the 
ribs of the tanker’s body. “That's 
a collapsible plastic shell inside 
there,” he said. “When all the fuel 
is gone, you can see through it.” 

The spacecraft drifted close 
enough to the huge tanker for Jon 
to pick out, by Jupiter’s yellow 



180 



IF 




light, the markings of the Terran 
Mining Corporation on the hull 
of the control cabin. Then the 
tanker receded and the Santa Bar - 
baras rockets came to life for the 
descent. 

Ill 

H IS helmet off, Jon had the 
fleeting impression that he was 
back on Callisto. The entrance to 
the compound, he thought, was as 
similar to its Callisto mate as two 
motels of a chain on Earth. The 
decorator had used slightly dif- 
ferent pastel paints this time. But 
the large entrance sign with the in- 
tegral clock, reading Welcome 
to Terran Mining , Ganymede , 
16:30 , looked as though it had 
come from the same workshop as 
its Callisto counterpart. 

By the time he had been led to 
his room Jon had seen that, for all 
its resemblance to the Callisto 
compound, the Ganymede struc- 
ture was much smaller. That was 
logical, he thought, since it lacked 
the offices of the top Terran Min- 
ing officers who were present on 
the more distant satellite. 

By the time the dining room 
clock read 17:25, Jon and Ralph 
had completed their light supper 
and Ralph was proposing a small 
tour of Ganymede. Jon agreed 
readily. He had things to see be- 
fore he met with the governor of 
Jupiter System. Too, he had al- 
ways imagined that Jupiter, seen 



from a near satellite, must be an 
awe-inspiring sight. 

The plastic treads of the two- 
man surface car rumbled and 
whined against the cold ground of 
Ganymede. Jon tried to estimate 
the speed of the vehicle but found 
the featurelessness of the land- 
scape made the motion seem more 
leisurely than it probably was. He 
wondered that a tread-equipped 
vehicle was capable of any great 
speed, but then realized that the 
woosh of air underneath was vir- 
tually keeping the car hoyering in 
the low gravity, with only enough 
ground contact to allow steering. 

The Sun was climbing rapidly 
toward zenith but the stars were 
still clearly visible. Ganymede 
lacked even the thin atmosphere 
that gave Callisto its velvety blue 
sky. 

Jon found the transmitter but- 
ton of his life-support suit and told 
Ralph of his desire for another 
look at Jupiter. 

“Fine with me,” answered 
Ralph, “but 1 think you’ll be sur- 
prised by what you see.’’ 

After a number of minutes of 
rapid travel along the cratered 
plain, Jon was realizing that 
Ganymede, for all its lack of grav- 
ity, was not tiny. It was in fact 
more than a % third the size of Earth. 

“It’s more than two thousand 
miles to the Jupiter side,’’ said 
Ralph’s voice in Jon’s earphones, 
“but you’ll be able to see part of it 
on the horizon if we take this 



SPACE SLICK 



181 




route. We’ll be there in an hour.” 

It was in fact forty-two minutes 
later that Jon noticed the first yel- 
low-green sliver of Jupiter rising 
above the jagged horizon. Grad- 
ually the ball grew and began to 
climb into the dark sky, as the sur- 
face car dropped down a long slop- 
ing hill. The hill turned even more 
sharply down as more of the huge 
planet appeared and Jon could 
hear the treads of the vehicle slip- 
ping on the rock below. 

'That’s far enough,” said Ralph 
and braked the car to a stop. He 
opened the door and invited Jon 
out. Still clumsy in the unac- 
customed bulk of the life-support 
suit, Jon swung his legs out of the 
vehicle, but as he stood up he lost 
his footing and fell several feet 
down the sharp incline. 

"Are you all right?” inquired 
the anxious voice in his head- 
phones. He was, though he could 
not instantly find the transmit- 
ter button to say so. Ralph helped 
him to his feet easily in the light 
gravity. 

Jon looked toward the panora- 
ma of Jupiter, watching its angry 
winds spinning across its center. 
He was momentarily surprised to 
see the Great Red Spot in this top 
half of the planet, but then realized 
that he must be looking at the 
southern hemisphere. Viewing the 
yellowish ball made him feel un- 
easy. The sharp downward slope 
gave him the impression that if he 
should slip again he might slide 



forever, down toward the big plan- 
et. 

He communicated his feeling to 
Ralph and heard a chuckle of re- 
sponse. "This isn’t really a hill,” 
said Ralph. If you surveyed it 
from orbit it would look as flat as 
anything else on Ganymede.” 

"But it is downhill,” Jon pro- 
tested. "That’s at least a twenty- 
degree slope.” 

"Nice guess. It’s just over 
nineteen degrees, actually. But 
it’s an illusion^ Normally, your 
hundred and seventy Earth pounds 
wouldn’t weigh more than twelve 
pounds in Ganymede’s light 
gravity. But Jupiter is so huge that 
even here, six hundred thousand 
miles away, it accounts for a 
gravitational pull about half that 
of Ganymede itself.” 

Inside the helmet Jon nodded. 

"It looks downhill to Jupiter,” 
continued Ralph, "because about 
a third of the gravitational pull on 
you is coming from Jupiter itself. 
That distorts your concept of 
which way ‘down’ is.” 

"I’m beginning to understand 
why the settlements are all on the 
side away from the planet.” 

"Right. On the inhabited side, 
where you benefit from the gravity 
of both Ganymede and Jupiter, 
you’ll weigh in at close to nineteen 
pounds. But if we drove around to 
the side facing Jupiter, the planet 
would be trying to pull you up- 
ward and you’d drop down to less 
than six pounds.”

IF 




J ON took a final look at the yel- 
low ball with the angry red spot 
and climbed back into the vehicle. 
He felt relieved once the surface 
car was climbing back up the 
seeming hill, away from Jupiter. 

Within twenty-five minutes, the 
last sliver of the big planet had van- 
ished behind the speeding vehicle 
and the bleak plain of Ganymede 
seemed fiat once more. The car 
rumbled on for more than ninety 
minutes among bleak craters, 
some with imposing high walls, 
but most of them small and unpre- 
possessing. 

Then he saw at a distance that 
seemed to be about five miles their 
next destination — the outline of 
a space mining site. Jon could see 
the huge automatic drills and the 
ore lifters, all of them as black as 
the sky of Ganymede. 

When the car had reached the 
site, he could see why the equip- 
ment reflected so little light. It was 
covered by a thick layer of a syrupy 
black substance. Jon saw even be- 
fore Ralph spoke that it was Type 
C fuel. 

“The edge of the slick just 
caught Mining Site Number 
Two,” said Ralph. “We’ve ap- 
proached it so as to avoid most of 
the slick. It goes for almpst forty 
miles that way.” He pointed into 
the distance. 

“Two men died here I believe?” 
Jon said into his suit microphone. 

“Yes, two miners,” said Ralph’s 
voice. “The danger of Ganymede’s 



meeting the slick was known. But 
.the final warning from Ganymede 
control came too late. The two 
men were still here when the fuel 
began to rain down. Type C fuel 
corrodes the organic materials 
used in life-support suits. The 
miners were dead in two minutes.” 

“Since the space slicks follow 
predictable orbits, like solid 
bodies, why wasn’t the disaster 
predicted sooner?” 

There was a long pause before 
Jon heard Ralph’s transmitter 
carrier again. “As Industrial 
Standards Officer for Terran 
Mining Corporation,” he said, 
“I’m supposed to assure you that 
such a thing wouldn’t happen 
again. Little was known then about 
the mechanics of the slicks. They 
behave like solids most of the time 
because of their .internal elec- 
trical fields. But they break up sud- 
denly in a strong gravitational 
field.” 

Jon’s eyes ran over the stout 
frame of the ore lifter which, even 
from a few feet away, looked more 
like a shadow than a substantial 
object. He fancied he saw a drop 
of fuel drip from a cable. Jon mar- 
veled at how little the fuel had 
evaporated in four years despite 
the lack of atmosphere. 

He touched his suit transmitting 
button once more. “Suppose the 
slick had hit an inhabited com- 
pound instead of a mining instal- 
lation?” 

“That,” came the answer, “is 



SPACE SLICK 



183 




something the governor of Jupi- 
ter System will no doubt want to 
bring up with you.” 

J ON MATHER slept badly that 
night. He could not shut Jupiter 
from his sight and he was falling, 
falling into the planet. The stormy 
bands of powerful wind were get- 
ting closer, but his feet were slip- 
ping on an ocean of Type C fuel 
and he could not check his drop 
toward the angry world. The Great 
Red Spot glared at him wrath- 
fully, like the eye of a Cyclops. 
Come , it said. 

Jon saw again the abandoned 
fuel-fouled structure of Mining 
Site Number Two. The lonely dark 
framework of the equipment was 
awash with the black syrup. And 
now he could see, standing among 
the abandoned machines, two 
skeletons, looking out ac- 
cusingly, their silent jaws drool- 
ing the thick liquid that was every- 
where. 

He saw Jupiter once more and 
heard a voice somewhat like 
Ralph’s. “Jupiter is hydrogen and 
helium,” said the familiar voice, 
like that of a tour guide. “The 
gases are too colorless to form the 
Great Red Spot. Helium is inert. 
But the red-colored compounds of 
hydrogen are all organic. Thus the 
spot is undoubtedly organic. 

Jon saw Mining Site Number 
Two again, fouled with fuel. But 
this time the site was on the tem- 
pest-tossed surface of Jupiter it- 



self. And this time the fuel was not 
inky black but red, like the Great 
Red Spot, like a vast sea of blood. 
The two skeletons stood, covered 
in red, extending bony index fin- 
gers. 

At him. 

G overnor Robert no- 

LAN was a much younger 
man than Jon would have 
expected — thirty-five at the very 
most, he estimated. The reason 
for that was evident: the rugged 
and bleak satellites of Jupiter 
were a place for a young and 
vigorous man. 

Governor Nolan received Jon in 
an unostentatious private office 
in the government complex, 
which was about twenty minutes 
by surface car from the much lar- 
ger quarters of Terran Mining. 
It did not take long for Terran 
Mining to come into the con- 
versation. 

“We have little power here,” he 
was saying. “As you no doubt 
know, Jupiter System has a status 
in the Solar Federation inferior 
to that of most countries on Earth, 
to say nothing of colonies like 
Mars or the Moon. There’s little 
we can do — without Federation 
help — to combat this kind of 
menace.” 

“If I understand Terran Min-- 
ing’s argument,’’ said Jon, 
“they’re saying, that Jupiter Sys- 
tem is not intended to be a pretty 
environment, but merely a rock 



184 



IF 




bed to be exploited for all the 
minerals it contains.” 

The governor nodded. “I know 
all that. And they’re right in a way, 
of course. There’s no ecology to 
harm here and I’m not suggesting 
that we try to beautify Callisto 
and Ganymede. They’re modern 
equivalents of the old Earth min- 
ing towns, meant to pay, not 
please.” 

Nolan paused. “But now we 
have six slicks in orbit, not count- 
ing the one that struck Mining 
Site Number Two. That’s the 
situation after five years. How 
many slicks will we have after ten 
years, fifteen years? And how 
large? Each new tanker is built lar- 
ger than the last.” 

Jon looked at him, not speak- 
ing. After a decade of fighting the 
scars of a century of pollution on 
Earth, Jon Mather’s instincts ran 
parallel to those of Governor 
Nolan. Certainly he did not be- 
lieve that limited pollution could 
remain limited. 

Yet he knew that the economic 
reality of Jupiter System made 
the pollution inevitable. There 
would be no settlement of Jupi- 
ter’s satellites at all without Ter- 
ran Mining. Indeed, all but a few 
of the men governed by Nolan were 
employees of Terran Mining. 
They owed their livelihood to the 
continuance of practices that 
made cheap commercial ex- 
ploitation of Ganymede and 
Callisto possible, even if it meant 



fuel slicks in orbit, like so many 
man-made asteroids. 



T HE trip back to Earth was 
long for Jon. It was true that 
he had Ralph Lake to talk to, 
since Ralph had easily maneuvered 
his employer into letting him ac- 
company Jon to Earth, ostensibly 
to remind him of the company’s 
side of the argument. 

And then he had a report to 
write. He would be seeing the 
Transport Secretary of the Solar 
Federation and he had his recom- 
mendations to decide on. 

Jon was lonely for Earth. He 
deeply loved his home planet — per- 
haps that was why space exploits 
had tempted him little — and that 
love had been deepened by the ten 
years he had spent healing her 
beauty. 

As the Santa Barbara sped 
silently through the blackness of 
deep space, Jon spoke gladly of the 
Earth the younger man had not 
seen for nearly ten years. He would 
find it changed, Jon promised. The 
number of trees had more than 
doubled, would double again in the 
coming decade. Beaches on the 
Great Lakes were a booming 
tourist attraction unparalleled in 
anyone’s memory. There was even 
good swimming on the Hudson 
River. 

“Is the Nile green again?” asked 
Ralph. 

“Yes. Ten years ago it was all 



SPACE SLICK 



185 




the rainbow colors an oil slick can 
produce.” 

“The last legacy of the petro- 
leum age,” mused Ralph. “But it 
wasn’t only the development of 
new fuels that turned the trick?” 

“No, though there was a lot of 
technology involved. We made 
more than thirty different recom- 
mendations requiring the 
development of new equipment 
and techniques. The Solar 
Federation provided the cash to 
follow up everyone of them. 
There were new means to precipi- 
tate waste solids in the atmo- 
sphere. There were new means of 
disposing of sewage and indus- 
trial waste. And there were new 
means of catching up for more 
than a hundred years of neglect. 
For instance, we drained Lake 
Erie for six months and scrubbed 
its basin, before refilling it with 
fresh water and restocking it with 
fish.” 

“Incredible!” 

“The Federation expropriated 
huge tracts of land all over the 
world to build newly forested park- 
lands.” 

“To help replenish the oxygen 
supply?” 

“Exactly. And a new paperlike 
plastic was developed, so that mil- 
lions of trees need not be cut down 
just to produce one day’s news- 
papers. Furthermore, we found 
our own application for the 
oxygen regenerators that were 
already on the market. The larger 



industries are now obliged to 
generate and release into the 
atmosphere at least ninety per- 
cent of the oxygen consumed by 
their other machines. The oxygen 
content of the atmosphere is now 
back to twenty percent — and it’s 
still rising.” 

Ralph was thoughtful. “There’s 
no doubt that you’re the miracle 
man of Earth,” he said. “But on 
this mission they sent you all by v 
yourself, with no fellow commis- 
sion members. Does the Federa- 
tion really expect you to solve the 
space-slick problem?” 

“I suppose not. I’m expected to 
make some innocuous sugges- 
tions that will keep the crisis at 
least temporarily within con- 
trol, to calm the anxious.” 

“If I know you,” said Ralph, 
“you won’t do that at all. You’ll 
tell the Federation to act now or 
face a situation worse than Earth’s 
later on.” 

Jon smiled. “I guess you know 
me,” he said, then added: “But if I 
do that, my report will be put in the 
circular file.” 

“Did you suspect that when you 
accepted the assignment?” 

“Oh, I had my illusions. After 
all, for the first time in history, a 
man had been given the green light 
to clean up the Earth. I had been 
that man and Earth had listened to 
me. Why could I not hope that it 
would again, if I told Earth she 
could not hope to remain pure in a 
defiled universe?” 



186 



IF 




“And I thought only the young 
had illusions like that.” 

“Which brings up the ques- 
tion,” said Jon, “of why you chose 
to take the ISO job with Terran 
Mining,” 

“How many times I’ve asked 
myself that question!” he said. 
“But you weren’t the only man 
with illusions. I was shaken by 
what men had done to Earth and 
were doing even to dead Mars. 
Rather than remain on Mars and 
be a party to its ravage. I took a 
chance on a job in which I could 
aid industry to keep the environ- 
ment clean.” He smiled wryly. 

“Only it took me time to realize 
that my real job was to find excuses 
not to do it.” 

T HE meeting at the Solar Fed- 
eration building, the huge new 
addition to the complex that had 
once housed the United Nations, 
had gone as expected. Jon had 
been somewhat surprised that he 
had been allowed to see only the 
Assistant Transport Secretary 
and not the Secretary himself. He 
had explained his report with em- 
phasis on as many telling points 
as he could think of and he had 
been rewarded with a patient hear- 
ing. But now Jon held the letter 
from the Federation acknowledg- 
ing his report. The letter needed 
very little reading between the 
lines. 

“I understand your point of 
view,” the Assistant Secretary 



had told him, “but we must look at 
facts. There is no ecology to kill 
out there, no delicate balance of 
nature to upset as there is on 
Earth. We can learn to avoid fuel 
slicks in space as easily as we avoid 
the space debris that is not of our 
making. 

“What you must understand is 
that the remarkable work you ac- 
complished here on Earth could 
not have been done at an earlier 
time — and not only because there 
was no Solar Federation. Earlier 
generations had to choose between 
genuine pollution control and 
industrial development. They 
could not renounce the latter and 
so settled for a useless minimum 
of the former. 

“If we were able to let you clean 
up Earth, it was because the lar- 
gest industrial interests are no 
longer on it. They are on the Moon 
now, making steel and fuel; on 
Mars, making heavy machinery 
and on Jupiter System, mining 
metal. 

“The conservationists have re- 
claimed Earth because the 
polluters have forsaken it for 
space. Before they can reclaim 
the Solar System, industry will 
have to go to the stars.” 

T HERE was only one of Jon 
Mather’s recommendations 
that the Federation seemed 
inclined to accept. They would not 
force the supertankers to use in- 
direct approaches to inhabited 



SPACE SLICK 



187 




bodies, would not force them to use 
thicker and safer hulls, would not 
limit their size, would not develop 
the equipment needed to collapse 
the electrical fields of the space 
slicks and scatter them. However, 
the Chedabucto y Jon had noted, 
had collided with an asteroid be- 
cause of its malfunctioning radar 
unit and the commander’s failure 
to get adequate course informa- 
tion from the Martian spaceport. 
The Federation agreed that there 
should be stricter rules forcing 
tankers to carry more safety 
equipment and to follow naviga- 
tional rules. 

If the Federation had acted 
swiftly enough to enact the new 
regulations the California and the 
Skagway might not have collided. 

Jon was basking in the Spring 
magnificence of his country home 
when the news of the collision 
came. Still with him as a house 
guest was Ralph Lake, spending 
his accumulated leave from Ter- 
ran Mining. Ralph had not yet re- 
covered from the newfound 
vitality of Earth. He was doubly 
amazed by the presence of this 
new Eden in the heavily mined out 
Appalachian mountains, once an 
ugly scar on the face of the planet, 
and the personal hell of some of 
North America’s poorest people. 

But now the small mining towns, 
with the rows of tin shacks, were 
gone, dismantled. The trees were 
back, as were the grass, the 
flowers, the birds and the brilliant 



unfiltered sunshine. The brook, 
which Ralph guessed had once 
served as an industrial sewer, was 
pure enough to drink from. 

The news of the collision of the 
two supertankers was a jolt back 
to ugly reality for both men. They 
watched the television screen 
anxiously, as space-borne cam- 
eras beamed, live, the familiar 
image of the black smudge of a 
space slick, this time against the 
backdrop of the Moon. 

But these two new tankers had 
been the forerunners of a new lar- 
ger type. They had just been com- 
pleted in orbit off the Moon and 
were bound on their maiden voy- 
age to Jupiter, when an uncor- 
rected radar fault in the Skagway 
allowed the two vessels to brush 
too close. Their cargo spilled into 
the void. 

The huge new slick was not like 
the others. This time it contained 
200 million liters of fuel and its 
oily bulk diffused into a mist that 
spread over more than a million 
cubic miles. 

It floated uncertainly not far 
from Earth. 

Earth’s inhabitants watched 
agonizingly, from day to day, as 
the huge slick skirted the outer 
reaches of the atmosphere. After 
five days came the good news from 
a scientist at Dunway obser- 
vatory on the Moon: the slick was 
in a stable orbit about Earth and 
would remain there. Its threat was 
ended. 



188 



IF 




Jon turned off the television 
screen. Ralph gazed into the dark- 
ness. 

At length the younger man said, 
“He’s wrong you know.” 

Jon whirled round to face him. 

“He’d be right about the sta- 
bility of the orbit if he could be 
sure that the Skagway slick would 
continue to behave ljke a genuine 
solid object. But the slick is now in 
the gravitational field of Earth. 



Anyone on Ganymede could tell 
you what will happen.” 

“Perhaps — ” said Jon slowly — 
“perhaps this time it won’t hap- 
pen. 

He was wrong of course. The 
Sun, rising above the worn Ap- 
palachians, shone down through 
the sullen dimness of the yellowed 
sky. By noon the thick viscous rain 
was already falling on the dying 
trees. •

Dear Sir: 

I have been reading both your mag- 
azine and your sister magazine , Gal- 
axy, for lo these years and the recent 
changes in the makeup and content of 
both magazines bother me. 

I have no objection to the introduc- 
tion of new writing talent provided it is 
TALENT! But I haven t completed the 
current issue and already Vm *‘re- 
gusted” with the levels set in this issue. 

To list a few gripes: 

The Watchers — one of the hoar- 
iest plots in all of sf and badly 
done at that. Ids so old it might 
seem new to a neophyte, but I 
never thought Vd see that one in 
print again . 

She Still Do — introduction of 
extraneous plot material causes 
a muddled picture. Just what is 
Rogers getting at with the intro- 
duction of wife-beating, etc? 
Monarch — This is supposed to 



189 




be the last of the Dr. Dillingham 
series and 1 say hurrah! I have 
never found dentistry a fit sub- 
ject for fiction. 

A nd on and on and on. 

I have heard a rumor that you have 
several of A. Bertram Chandler s Rim 
series with good old Grimes in them in 
your files. May I suggest , instead of 
printing neophyte material which 
would receive an F in a beginning 
writing' class that you print a whole is- 
sue of Chandler. Then your readers 
would have something to read! 

Sincerely yours , 
JOHN BURNS 
Hollywood , Cal. 

You’ll have to keep burning a while, 
John. Contrary to your informa- 
tion, we’re freshly out oLGrimes 
stories, but hoping for more. 

Gentlemen: 

I don't belive it! Is Laumer kidding?

In what context? 

Dear sirs: 

Since P.H. Vogel raised the issue in 
your letter column recently , I feel the 
urge to tell you my own definition of 
science fiction: 

Science fiction is that branch of 
fiction which deals with events 
and phenomena that cannot be 
said to have any definite exis- 
tence in the real world, but 
which could, in the opinion oj 
the author, exist without our be- 
ing aware of them, especially in 
the future. 

Also, in the interest of egotism, I 



would like to present my idea of those 
things which science fiction is especial- 
ly good at doing: 

1 ) Exercising the imagination. 

2) Developing perspective. 

3) Expanding the interests of the 
reader into arts, sciences, and politics. 

4} Examining the consequences of a 
change. 

5) Examining an ideal pragmatical- 

ly- 

6 ) Wedding art to science. 

7 ) Illustrating a principle. 

8) Escaping into reality { science fic- 
tion is a kind of escapist literature that 
tends to mirror the real world much 
more than detective stories, television, 
or sword & sorcery fantasy. It thus 
has a therapeutic effect on the neurot- 
ic escapist.) 

Number 3 is the only benefit of sci- 
ence fiction that I can claim as com- 
pletely my own, but I think the list has 
value in giving the reader an idea of 
how science fiction is essentially 
different and potentially better than 
fantasy and straight fiction. I hope 
you will find the definition and the list 
interesting and useful. 

Yours truly, 
J.W.Zabel 
Youngstown, O. 

P.S. Your story introductions are 
ihe worst in the business. 

If you mean story blurbs, I couldn’t 
agree with you more. And while we’re 
on definitions — how about some 
ideas on what science fiction can say 7 
Or mean? 

Dear Editor: 

Have read If and Galaxy for many 
years and this is my first time to write 



190 




any editor. But , like WOW! I now feel 
I must tell you how much I enjoyed the 
Nov.- Dec. issue. Not a bad story in it , 
and one exceptionally great one. 

A Hefping Hand by Juanita Coul- 
son has my vote for the best short story 
of the year , followed closely with 
Shambolain by Dean A. Koontz. 

More, more, more by these two fine 
authors. 

Florence Jenkins

Dear Mr . Jakobsson; 

Congratulations on your fine edi- 
torial work in Galaxy and its sister 
publications. Vve been reading them 
for over a decade and though there 
have been some lousy stories, I can say 
on the whole Vve enjoyed them tre- 
mendously. And perhaps look for- 
ward with more anxiety to each new 
issue since you took over, than be- 
fore. I think this is only to see what's 
going to happen next. In fact I think 
most magazines are pretty exciting 
these days, even if I don't always agree 
with the authors. 1 
/ was happy to see that Worlds of 
Tomorrow was being revived. I found 
after much searching the, first new is- 
sue and was favorably impressed. 
Then I saw the second new issue and 
bought it. 

I have a complaint now. Our dis- 
tributor, like many throughout the 
country, evidently doesn't like to han- 
dle anything but sex and j or slay mag- 
azines. Therefore I got my copy out of 
town while visiting friends. The issue 
is good , especially the editorial. I know 
quite a few students from Kent State, 
living where / do, and have heard many 
viewpoints on the matter. 

/ therefore looked forward to the 



Science-fiction 
stories frem 
Socialist 
countries 

Here is a book that is truly a boon to 
science-fiction fans— the best stories 
of nine writers whose work has 
seldom, if ever, appeared on this side 
of the Atlantic. 

Whether the reader comes to 
OTHER WORLDS, OTHER SEAS for pure 
enjoyment— or to grasp a deeper 
understanding of socialist idealism— 
he is sure to come away fully satisfied. 

“An immensely valuable addition to 
the science fiction canon... great 
enjoyment. ~ frederik pohl

rest of the issue. Unfortunately, in the 
first piece, I got halfway through and 
found myself staring at page 129. Sir, 
pages 33 to 64 are replaced by pages 
129-160. 

It is next to impossible for me to re- 
turn this magazine to the dealer where 
I bought it. I was and am still burned 
up over the fact that I paid 75 1 for an 
imcomplete magazine. 

What / have read around, the mag- 
azine is good. I hope it makes it, but I 
think you better check the next time to 
keep this from happening. Vll buy the 
next issue, when and if it ever shows up 
around here. But please dont let this 
happen again. 

Sincerely Yours, 
John A . Beck

An intact copy has been mailed to 
you. Machines at the binder’s some- 
times — but infrequently — make errors 
and a limited number of misbound 
copies go through before they’re 
caught. Your letter was the first inti- 
mation I had that anything had gone 
wrong with the winter issue of WOT. 
Sorry you were inconvenienced. 

Dear Sir: 

I am interested in obtaining infor- 
mation concerning Paolo Soleri and his 
Containers for the Condition of Man, 
(Galaxy, July, 1970) especially 
Arcosanti. The Arizona container fas- 
cinates me and / would like to know 
the requirements for obtaining a niche 
in this revolutionary “city.” I would 
greatly appreciate any help you can 
give me. 

Thank you.

Sir: 

I would like to correspond with Pa- 
olo Soleri who was mentioned in the 
article. Containers for the Condition of 
Man, in your magazine (Galaxy, July, 
1970). The author was Lauri Virta. 

I am a college student — mathemat- 
ics — interested in the above-mentioned 
“ condition .” I want to find out how 
Mr. Salens work on a live experi- 
ment is progressing; if there is any- 
one in my area doing such work; and if 
there is any possibility of my work- 
ing on such a project or related 
studies. I have access to a large com- 
puter, and have some capacity for sim- 
ulation studies or whatever. I also 
would not mind wielding a cement 
mixer for a summer. 

Thank you. 

Gregory Chesson 
Schenectady, New York 



You will reach Mr. Paolo Soleri by 
writing to him at the Cosanti Founda- 
tion, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251. 



S IX months have passed since the 
last report to the consumers in 
Galaxy — it’s time for another. If I can 
shoulder enough other type out of the 
way the latest six-month collection of 
your bombs, bouquets and bullets will 
appear in the April issue: 

Featured will be your comments on 
contents from Heinlein to Silverberg 
and others, survey results. The bou- 
quets are beautiful. The bullets are 
deadlier than the bombs— and this is 
true: You never hear the one that kills 
you. — JAKOBSSON
