liuiiuiiiiuiiiiiiiiiuiuiuiiauuiiuiii^ 

Let's look ahead a hundred years or 
so when we have a space station a 
thousand miles up and exploratory 
travel to the nearer planets. The 
question in the mind of everyone 
who considers such a possibility is: 
What kind of life will we find out 
there? 

Conjectures as to the answer to 
that question are certainly many 
and varied and pro and con. But 
whatever the right answer even- 
tually turns out to be, for the time 
being IF has just come up with an- 
other scoop! Not only for a science 
fiction publication but for any other 
publication as well. It isn’t often 
that a magazine or newspaper can 
boast of an article by a scientist of 
the stature of Dr. Walther Riedel — 
and that’s just what IF can do. In 
the next issue Dr. Riedel, world’s 
ranking aerophysicist and propul- 
sion expert, presents his views on 
the possibilities of finding intelli- 
gent life on other planets. 

Dr. Riedel, as you doubtlessly al- 
ready know, was director of Peene- 


muende and head of the German 
Government’s entire rocket pro- 
gram during the latter part of 
World War II — a time when they 
had out-distanced by far the entire 
world in rocket development. Com- 
ing to America after the war, he 
worked for Uncle Sam at the Aber- 
deen Proving Grounds, Fort Bliss 
and White Sands. Right now he is 
in Nuremburg, where he is carry- 
ing on his work in research and ap- 
plied science. This is the first time 
Dr. Riedel has ever written for an 
American magazine and, to put it 
mildly, we think you’ll be interested. 
Don’t miss what he has to say in 
This Lonely Earth in the December 
IF! 

When tin editor suddenly starts 
getting deluged with manuscripts 
from an unknown writer and the 
manuscripts keep coming in, some- 
thing in the mail every week, come 
rain, snow, or sleet or rejects, and 
finally he starts clicking — well you 
begin to wonder about the tenacity 
or stubbornness or something of the 
writer. Such was the case with 
Charles L. Fontenay, a newspaper 
man down in Tennessee, who has 
appeared in IF with Disqualified , 
Escape Velocity^ Blow the Man 
Down y The Patriot , Atom Drive , Z, 
and Communication in this issue. 
He has another coming up in the 
December issue, a gem of a story 
about a “do gooder” whose in- 
tended victim is a man of a “super 
race”. The title is Family Tree — 
and it’s good reading! 

Anyhow, when his story first ap- 
peared in IF and when we were 
getting curious about him, he 


2 




dropped into the office to say ‘hello” 
and that was about all, for he was 
gone again before I could even take 
him to lunch. Since then, however, 
we’ve gotten a line on him — past, 
present, and prospective future. 

“Thinking back”, he wrote us re- 
cently, “I suppose I’m one of the 
real veteran science fiction fans. In 
the late ’20s, Boys* Life ran a fourth 
dimension story and that got me 
into it ... I started writing science 
fiction, for no good reason, in 
August, 1953, and sold my first to 
IF five months later.” 

Fontenay turns out a prodigious 
amount of copy (which we sus- 
pected), considering that his full- 
time job is that of rewrite man on 
The Nashville Tennessean, where 
he has been for nearly ten years. In 
addition to the scores of science fic- 
tion pieces he has written, he 
completed a biography of Estes 
Kefauver last year. Due to lack of 
time to whip it into final shape, he 
sold the manuscript to Jack An- 
derson and Fred Blumenthal of 
Washington, D. C., who are now 
editing it and rewriting it under 
their joint by-line. It is due for 
publication soon under the Dial im- 
print. But Fontenay is already at 
work on another novel, a historical 
one based on the life of Ptolemy I. 

One of Fontenay’s outstanding 
assignments as a newspaper man 
was back in 1948, when he covered 
the campaign of Senator Kefauver 
in which the Crump machine was 
overthrown. He has also covered 
several governor’s races, five legis- 
lative sessions and a constitutional 
convention, all for Tennessee news- 
papers and when he was with the 


Associated Press. The story he re- 
calls most fondly, one that hit the 
nation’s front pages, was the orig- 
inal story on the famous “yoo hoo” 
incident, just before the last war, 
when General Ben Lear made an 
entire regiment march from Mem- 
phis to Little Rock because they 
had shouted at a woman in shorts. 

Charles Fontenay was born in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, but raised by his 
uncle in Union City, Tennessee. Be- 
cause his father was English and his 
mother American, he encountered 
certain complications when he ap- 
plied for a commission in the in- 
telligence corps in World War II. 
However, he made it, and came out 
a captain after 33 months in the 
South Pacific. Right now, to fill in 
all the spare time he has between 
his rewrite job, science fiction and 
other writing, he is something of a 
correspondence chess player (1950 
Class C North American Cham- 
pion), does oil and water color 
painting (two first and two second 
prizes at Tennessee State Fairs), 
landscape gardening, with roses a 
specialty, and Chinese cooking! “A 
native of Canton,” he informs us, 
“just returned to New York from 
Formosa, has been my ritual blood 
brother since boyhood and he helps 
me get materials for paper-wrapped 
chicken and other Chinese dishes.” 

Asked if he was married, he re- 
plied that he was. “Thirteen years 
ago I married my girl from Ne- 
braska”, he said, and then added, 
“So far, the only patter of feet 
around the house is that of Maxi- 
milian von Fortlagehaus — our red 
dachshund.”

THE HAPPY HERD 


Everyone was thoughtful, considerate, kind and very happy; 


But where was the right of dignity or individuality ? 


It was like being dropped into the middle of a nightmare. 


The kind that finds you running naked in a crowd . 



Illustrated by Ed Emsh 


HE CAPTAIN told Kane to 
take his cushion pills, that they 
were contacting the pits at La 
Guardia within half an hour. 

“I still can’t figure you,” the 
Captain said. “Up there, just you 
and your wife for sixteen years. 
That’s a hell of a long time.” 
Kane smiled. He had been almost 
completely out of touch with the 
world for sixteen years, and it 
surprised him a little that anyone 
thought it remarkable in any way. 
Particularly the Captain who spent 
most of his time, too, alone. 


But the Captain was genuinely 
perturbed about it. The authorities 
had abandoned the space-station 
project. Abandoned the Martian 
project. They had taken away the 
other three ships from the Moon- 
run, and there was no explanation 
for it at all. 

The rest of the Captain’s crew, 
except an old atomics man, had 
drifted away and never come back, 
and the Captain had been unable 
to find out anything whatsoever 
about what had happened to them. 
He had never heard from them 



BY BRYCE WALTON 




again. They had never been re- 
placed. 

But the Captain couldn’t seem to 
define what it was he was warning 
Kane to be wary of down there. 

“I haven’t left my ship for years, 
Professor Kane, and that’s the 
truth. I take on supplies and see 
to the ore getting into the holds but 
when those machines up there that 
do the digging and loading wear 
out, they won’t be replaced. Just no 
interest in space any more. I can 
tell. 

“I stay on the ship, with my wife, 
see. And the few guys down there 
around the field at La Guardia I 
have to rub up against — why, sir, 
they treat me as if I had some kind 
of contagious disease! 

“But they need this ore I’m 
bringing back here now, so they 
leave me alone.” ~ 

“Who leaves you alone?” 

“Whoever didn’t leave the rest 
of my crew alone. Whoever sang 
’em the old siren song, that’s who. 
Once a spaceman, always a space- 
man, sir. And not a one of those 
men pulled out because he wanted 
to do it! That’s what I’m saying. 
And I’m telling you to watch out. 
I’m blasting off for the Moon again 
on the 25th. I hope you’re aboard.” 

Kane shrugged as the Captain 
bowed out, making disgruntled 
noises in his throat. He was getting 
along in years, Kane reasoned, and 
was probably just expressing that 
fact, externalizing some way or an- 
other. Still, what he had said was 
odd — 

The truth was, Kane had been 
inexcusably out of contact with the 
world. 

6 


The pills dulled his senses and he 
began to fall asleep on the pneu- 
matic couch. He thought of the 
years of work on his theories con- 
cerning the unified fields in the 
formulation of spatial matter. He 
thought of Helen, the good years 
together before her sudden death, 
sharing love and work, how com- 
plete and full and good it had been. 
During all those sixteen years he 
couldn’t recall a moment of real 
boredom. 

He hadn’t missed life on Earth. 
When a man has one full love and 
his work, he’s isolated no matter 
where he is, even in the middle of 
New York City. 

He had ten notebooks full of 
notes in his briefcase. It would open 
their eyes, a really basic new theory 
that would defy the pessimistic 
theory of entropy, and its assurance 
of an inevitable death of all things. 

Finding another wife to replace 
Helen wouldn’t be easy of course. A 
new relationship would be different, 
but it should be as good. It might 
require some difficulties which he 
had anticipated and was prepared 
for. He was only forty-six. He had a 
long time to look. He was in excel- 
lent physical condition and was not 
unattractive, though of course that 
wasn’t the real issue either way. 

He wanted love, a companion, 
someone who could truly share in 
his work. Who would love that 
observatory in Albetegnius crater 
as a home for the rest of her life. 

He woke up, and prepared to 
leave the ship. He carried his brief- 
case with his notes in it. The rest of 
his luggage would follow later. Ac- 
cording to Phil Nordsen, there was 

THE HAPPY HERD 



a suite reserved for him at the Mid- 
town Hotel at 50th and Madison 
Avenue. 

He climbed down the ladder to 
the exit. The door was open and a 
heavy fog drifted past the opening, 
but a small dark car with two 
drivers waited outside. 

As Kane stepped down the gang- 
plank, one of the figures, a woman 
in a light blue uniform, jumped out 
and opened the door for him. 

Interest and excitement rose in 
Kane as the car moved through the 
mist toward the terminal where he 
was to meet Phil. It would probably 
do him good, get away from his 
work, different surroundings, just 
rest up a little. Even live it up a lit- 
tle perhaps. There would be parties, 
and he wanted to see a little of the 
country. Maybe visit some of 
Helen’s relatives in the Middle 
West, and he certainly wanted to 
have some long bull sessions with 
Professors Martinson and Legmann 
over at the University. 

Then there was the question of 
meeting the right kind of woman. 
That was something only the fates 
could decide, Kane thought. He 
was no romantic, but that sort of 
thing wasn’t something you could 
figure out in advance, plot out like 
an equation. It wasn’t anything you 
could handle with personality 
charts, though they had been trying 
that when he’d left The personality 
you could measure with gadgets was 
such a small part of it really . 

But Phil would arrange for the 
social activities. As he recalled his 
old schoolmate, he remembered that 
Phil was a very social kind of fel- 
low. Phil had thought it was absurd, 

BRYCE WALTON 


Kane’s volunteering for that job in 
Albetagnius. Phil hadn’t even gone 
on to post-graduate work in elec- 
tronics, his chosen field. Phil had 
gone right out to accept a position 
with Isotopics Unlimited, some- 
where in New Jersey. 

They had corresponded for a 
while; and the cablegram from Phil 
had expressed Phil’s delight at 
Kane’s decision to return to Earth. 

The car stopped before the well- 
lighted entrance to terminal build- 
ing No. 214 and the woman hopped 
out, opened the door for Kane. He 
went inside the building, feeling the 
abnormally heavy pull of gravity. 
He had grown accustomed to the 
gravity on the Moon, and though 
his body was already starting to 
adapt itself, it would take time, and 
he was beginning to feel the drag. 

Phil was there waiting. He hadn’t 
mentioned anyone else being there, 
and Kane certainly didn’t expect 
anyone else. He didn’t know any- 
one really, no one other than Phil 
except Martin and Legmann. But 
there was Phil, and a number of 
people around him, and they were 
all rushing toward Kane, smiling, 
shouting, waving their arms. Phil 
looked much the same, tall and 
flashily dressed, thin and good look- 
ing as always, but with hair slightly 
greying. 

The others, men, women, various 
ages and sizes, waving scarfs and 
circling eagerly around Kane, broke 
out in a happy chorus of mixed 
voices: 

Greetings! Welcome , Old Friend 

Kane! 

Welcome home to Earth again .

Kane felt a brief compulsion to 
retreat, but that was absurd. 

“Good to see you, Prof!” Phil 
shouted. 

“Hello, Phil.” Someone grabbed 
his briefcase. Kane tried to get it 
back but it was gone among the 
frothing arms and milling bodies. 

“We’ll take care of it, Kane boy,” 
Phil said. His arm was over Kane’s 
shoulders. Several women were 
hanging onto Kane’s arms. Healthy, 
tanned, lovely women. 

“Sure glad to see you, Prof. 
Aren’t we?” 

A chorus enthusiastically 
shrieked, “Yes!” 

Kane felt some embarrassment. 
He was being crowded out an exit 
toward a line of cabs. Several shiny 
ten-foot saucers with railings 
around them whirred past and dis- 
appeared in the fog. All of them 
had two or more people on them, 
and from the sound, there were 
quite a number of them up in the 
fog somewhere. 

“We’ve all got a saucer now,” 
Phil said. “Only we have to take 
cabs over to Lucie’s house. This way 
we can all ride together. We can all 
get into two cabs, can’t we, gang?” 

“Yes!” 

“Lucie?” Kane asked as they 
crowded around the two cabs. Who 
were these people? Friends of Phil’s 
of course. 

“We’re Lucie,” the woman said 
softly. Kane caught a glimpse of a 
mature face and a lovely figure. 
The face was odd, Kane thought, 
the maturity seeming to be disguised 
by an insincere smile. What a 
peculiar way of introducing one- 
self . 

S 


“We’re having a little party at 
the house,” Lucille said. “Aren’t 
we?” 

“Yes!” 

“We’ve got lots of fun planned 
for us, Kane boy,” Phil said. 

Kane remembered a look of 
sardonic mockery in Lucille’s eyes 
as her face disappeared and was re- 
placed by several others. 

Somehow, Kane couldn’t figure 
out how, five of them were jammed 
into the back seat of one of the cabs 
and then they were moving away 
through the fog. 

Someone who said “We’re 
Laura,” with a tight tanned body 
was wriggling on Kane’s lap and 
her arm was around Kane’s neck. 
She had bright teeth and she 
breathed scentedly into Kane’s face. 

“Nothing to worry about, Kane 
boy,” he heard Phil say in a muffled 
joy. “We’re the gang.” 

“ ‘It’s always fair weather, the 
Sunhill Gang is always together,’ ” 
Laura was crooning. The red-faced 
fat man next to Kane laughed and 
then Kane saw that the red-faced 
man whose name seemed to be Ben 
and the woman on his lap whom he 
called Jenny, were kissing one an- 
other. There was something em- 
barrassingly intimate about the way 
they did it. It was suddenly much 
more than a mere spontaneous 
show of affection. 

Kane looked away. Beyond a cer- 
tain point, he felt that love-making 
was something that should be re- 
served for privacy. 

That sort of thing might be ex- 
pected to change, of course. Cus- 
toms changed, and as Kane re- 
called, one could say the trend had 

THE HAPPY HERD 



been somewhat in that direction. 

There were two drivers up front. 
That was a change too. Every cab 
had had two drivers, a man and a 
woman. 

It was all a bit overdone, Kane 
thought. Still, they were friends of 
Phil’s. A friend of yours is a friend 
of mine. 

But it affected Kane adversely. 
He felt uneasy. He didn’t really 
know them at all. In fact, he scarce- 
ly even knew Phil. 

“We’re so glad with you,” the 
girl on Kane’s lap said. She crushed 
her lips over his mouth and pressed 
her body against him. Kane 
couldn’t say that was affecting him 
adversely. In fact, if there weren’t 
all these other people around — 

“We’re nice together,” Laura 
breathed against his lips. 

Everyone was so damn glad to 
see him. All they needed were ban- 
ners, little pins. Official Welcoming 
Party to Greet the Arrival of Pro- 
fessor Larry Kane. 

Kane managed to look out the 
window as they crossed the Tri- 
Borough Bridge at 125th Street 
and started up the East River Drive. 

“Things haven’t changed much,” 
Kane said. “Not nearly so much 
traffic though.” 

“The saucers,” Phil said. “Most 
of the traffic’s up in the air.” 

“We’re looking at things,” Laura 
said. 

“Great old town,” Ben said and 
laughed, on and on. Jenny laughed 
too, then said. “It looks just the 
same almost as when we left.” 

They’re all speaking for me, 
Kane thought. Funny, a damned 
funny custom. It was a reflection of 

BRYCE WALTON 


something else. What did it really 
mean? His feeling of unease seemed 
exaggerated. But then their efforts 
to make him welcome seemed 
pretty exaggerated too . 

“Everybody happy?” the fat man 
yelled. 

“Yes!” 

“We’re happy aren’t we, honey,” 
Laura said. 

“Sure,” Kane said. 

Why not? 

Kane noticed the amazing dearth 
of traffic on Madison Avenue. 

No traffic cops either. That had 
changed too. One thing you had al- 
ways been sure of seeing and that 
was a cop in New York. 

When Kane asked about it, the 
smiles almost fled from every face, 
and the moment of silence seemed 
like a form of shock. Kane realized 
then that there hadn’t been even 
a second of silence before then. 

“It’s hard to realize we’ve been 
away so long,” Phil finally said. 

“I’m really tired,” Kane said to 
Phil as they went on past the Mid- 
town Hotel toward Lucille’s apart- 
ment. “I was intending to go direct- 
ly to the hotel and rest up a 
while — ” 

“We’ll relax at Lucie’s” Jenny 
said. “We got music, we got music, 
we got music, who could ask for 
anything more?” 

“But — ” Kane started to protest 
at least mildly, but the rest of the 
sentence was blotted out by a long 
kiss from Laura. 


T HEY HAD all crowded into an 
elevator, and then rushed into 
Lucille’s apartment on a high level 

9 



of The Sunny Hill building near 
Washington Square. The apartment 
consisted of one huge room with a 
circular couch in the middle upon 
which everyone immediately sat. 

Laura sat beside Kane who was 
getting more tired every minute. 
There was just enough room for the 
gang to squeeze up tight to one an- 
other in a circle around a table 
supporting some kind of machine 
with wires that were immediately 
run from it and attached to every- 
one’s wrist, and to a narrow metal 
headband with which everyone’s 
head was crowned. 

Kane was listening to music. It 
was like being dropped unexpected- 
ly into the middle of a large sym- 
phony orchestra. The sound seemed 
to pulse and vibrate gigantically all 
around him. It was more than 
merely listening. He was in it. He 
felt himself a part of it, swimming 
in it, and almost fighting to keep 
from being carried away by what 
seemed to be perfectly recorded 
music that was now being delivered 
by some final form of hi-fi. 

The music itself was familiar 
enough. Instrumentalized opera 
arias orchestrated on a fantastic 
scale. The quantity was so great 
that sensitivity as to quality was 
dulled. Kane, shocked by thunder- 
ous sweeps of sheer volume gave 
way before the sound. It wasn’t 
sleep. He could hardly say he rested, 
but he was in a semi-stupor. When 
he glanced at his watch sometime 
later, two hours and some minutes 
had passed. 

The wires were being removed 
from wrists, headbands from heads. 
Kane’s head ached slightly. Every- 

10 


one was reaching as cards fell out 
of the machine in the middle. 

Laura handed one to Kane. It 
was covered with symbols in the 
form of some kind of graph, but 
he couldn’t decipher it. 

There was a great deal of chatter, 
musical jargon, colloquial in both 
space and time, most of it eluding 
comprehension. Kane stood there 
holding his card as everyone milled 
around one another. 

Phil said, “Let’s see how we liked 
it, Prof?” 

That seemed to have been the 
general idea — how much everyone 
liked the music. And each one 
looked at his card, and they were all 
comparing cards and exclaiming 
over them. 

Phil was looking at Kane’s card, 
comparing it with his own and with 
some other cards. 

“Well, not bad,” Phil was saying, 
“Is it, gang?” 

“Not bad at all!” they chorused. 

“What isn’t bad?” Kane asked. 

“Our taste, man,” Laura said. 
“You’ll fit so good.” 

The odd one, Lucille, raised an 
eyebrow, with some mockery in it 
still, at Kane. 

“You’ll sure belong, Professor. 
Don’t worry,” Lucille said. She held 
up her card. “We liked it.” 

“Of course it’ll take a little time,” 
Phil said as he threw his arm over 
Kane’s shoulder. “A few sessions 
and you’ll match up just right.” 

“I really don’t believe I under- 
stand,” Kane said vaguely. 

“You will,” Lucille said as she 
moved away from him. “You sure 
will, Professor.” She was tall, and 
with long lithe legs. She was a 

THE HAPPY HERD 



handsome woman, Kane thought. 

As Phil explained casually on the 
way toward the Midtown Hotel, 
they had just had a music session. 
Everything was done in sessions, 
in groups that is. Everyone had his 
group, and his group did everything 
together. 

Anyway, they had had a music 
session. The machine in the middle 
was a Reacto. The cards were 
Reacto Cards. It was really a kind 
of taste tester, and the point was 
that the Reacto tested everyone’s 
reaction to the music. 

The cards enabled everyone to 
check their reactions, check them 
against the reactions of all the 
others. It involved conformity rat- 
ings, and tendencies to stray from 
the group norm. 

The important thing about the 
taste rate cards was that they en- 
abled you to find out just how much 
group spirit you had. The closer 
your card resembled that of all the 
others in your group, the more GS 
you had. 

“My GS rating’s gone up,” Laura 
kept burbling all the way to the 
Midtown Hotel. “It’s gone up!” 

The same process applied to 
reading, movies, television, eating, 
anything involving the elements of 
reacting. The important thing was 
not how you yourself felt, but how 
you felt in relation to the feelings 
of the group. The problem seemed 
to be that of reducing deviation 
tendencies to a minimum. 

On the way to the Midtown 
Hotel, Jenny asked Phil how he 
liked the new best-seller, Love Is 
Forever , and Phil took a small card 
out of his wallet and they all com- 

BRYCE WALTON 


pared Reacto Cards in order to de- 
termine relative reactions to Love 
Is Forever . 

Good God! You had to look at a 
card to find out how you liked 
something! It was frightening as 
hell. 

Kane wondered how wide-spread 
how universal, it really was, this 
incredible conformity, this collective 
thinking. 

This appalling sacrifice of in- 
dividuality. 

Kane was too tired to give much, 
thought to it right then. He was 
anxious to get to the Hotel, and he 
was beginning to fantasize a bed, 
cool sheets, his body stretching and 
sinking down into blissful slumber. 

But as appalling as the situation 
seemed at the time, Kane soon 
found that he had only circled on 
the fringes of it. This was only the 
beginning. 

“Here we are, here were are, 
gang!” someone shouted as they 
piled out of the cabs and Kane was 
being hustled toward the suddenly 
formidable glint of a revolving 
door. 

So here we are, Kane thought. It 
was nice being here all right. He 
was glad, very glad. But it sounded 
as though someone might swoon 
over the fact. 

There was some difficulty with 
the revolving door. No one seemed 
able to move first, and there were 
spontaneous group lunges ending in 
jamming chaos in which someone 
hurt their arm. Kane thought it was 
the fat man, Ben. 

“We’re hurt!” Jenny screamed. 

“Oh — it’s not bad,” Ben said, 

11 



laughing all the time he was groan- 
ing. “Just bruised a little, gang. 
We’re just bruised a little/’ 

Kane grabbed his advantage and 
ventured alone through the revolv- 
ing doors into the lobby. A pair of 
desk clerks nodded across the lobby. 
A group was emerging from behind 
drapes and beyond them Kane saw 
an ornate, subtly lighted, cocktail 
lounge. 

Kane was heading for the eleva- 
tor when the gang overtook him. 

Laura had hold of one of his 
arms, and Phil the other. 

“We’re having cocktails,” Laura 
said. 

Phil repeated it, and Ben and 
Jenny joined in. The young man, 
Clarence, was singing as he herded 
the others toward the drapes of the 
cocktail lounge, and. they were all 
whisking Kane away before he 
could voice any protest. 

“What’ll the gang have?” the 
waiter asked, smiling. Only he 
wasn’t really smiling at any of them, 
Kane thought. He had picked out 
a center point of focus and was 
smiling at that so as not to appear 
to be smiling at any one, but at 
everyone. 

“Martinis!” several voices said. 

The waiter nodded, whirled 
away. 

“Ah, waiter,” Kane said. “I’ll 
have a double shot of Scotch. No 
ice.” 

The waiter seemed shocked, un- 
able to come to grips with Kane’s 
seemingly simple order. “But — but 
I thought you said Martini.” 

The gang was still smiling, but 
faintly. The waiter was backing 
away, 

12 


“No,” Kane insisted. “He said 
Martinis, and she said Martinis, 
and so did several others. But I 
didn’t say Martinis. I said Scotch, 
no ice.” 

“But Martinis — ” 

Ben forced a pained laugh. “But 
we ordered Martinis.” 

“Martinis,” Laura said. 

“The ayes always have it,” Kane 
heard Lucille whisper near him. 

Phil said, with a kind of shaky 
joviality. “Martinis — ” 

“Gin makes me ill,” Kane said. 
“For me, it has to be Scotch.” 

Phil whispered. “Scotch.” 
“Scotch,” the waiter said. 

A jukebox in a far corner blasted 
out from a sea of bubbling, multi- 
colored light 

We’re all pals togetherrrrrrrr . 

The Gang knows no bad weath - 
errrrrrr. 

We’re all for us all for us , 

And we’re rolling do-own life’s 
highway , 

On our crowded busssssss! 

Laura whispered huskily in his 
ear. “Don’t worry about any little 
old thing. We’re one together, 
man.” 


G OD HE was tired. He was so 
tired he could hardly sit there. 
He felt numb, and there was des- 
peration under the numbness. Kane 
wanted to get off somewhere by 
himself so he could rest, sleep, and 
think. He wanted to think . 

Bits of information drifted hap- 
hazardly into Kane’s consciousness 
from the conversation. He had 


THE HAPPY HERD 



ordered another double Scotch and 
was almost through with it. He was 
passing out, but held to conscious 
awareness by the unceasing banter, 
laughter and the jukebox — like a 
marionette held up with wires. 

If he suddenly found himself 
alone in silence, he knew he would 
collapse instantly. 

It seemed that this was a group 
with a certain common Reacto 
level, and they all worked in the 
same place, and lived in the same 
section of a big housing project, a 
place called Sunny Hill. 

Phil was their Integrator, and he 
was also an Official in the Isotopic 
Corporation where the Group 
worked. Phil was an Integrator for 
the Isotopic Corporation, a sort of 
personnel man whose main duty 
was the integration of the em- 
ployees’ private lives. 

When Kane tried to find out 
about the work itself, no one seemed 
interested enough to respond. The 
work was relatively unimportant. 
The emphasis seemed to be cen- 
tered almost completely on how 
people got along together. If your 
Reacto cards reported a general 
reaction that strayed too far from 
your Group norm, you were either 
sent to another group, or sent to a 
Staff. 

A Staff was a rather vague term 
for specialists in Integration on a 
clinical level. 

The job was always referred to as 
“our job”, and the Gang seemed to 
do practically everything together. 

Someone mentioned that a friend 
hadn’t been competent in group 
relations at school and had been 
Processed. Kane didn’t like the 


words they were so casually throw- 
ing around. In fact Kane didn’t 
like any of it, and he was liking it 
less all the time. 

Another term that referred to 
some sort of adjustment process 
was the word homogenized. Some- 
one had been “homogenized”. 

Once Kane tried to find out 
about his old friends, Professors 
Legmann, and Martin over at New 
York University. Phil avoided the 
question for a time, then finally 
admitted that Martin was still there 
in the archeology department, but 
that Legmann had quit the profes- 
sion years ago. “He quit teaching 
and became a plumber.” 

“A plumber?” Kane whispered. 
“Legmann?” 

“That’s right,” Phil grinned. 

“We’re all plumbing together,” 
Laura lisped. 

“But — that’s preposterous!” 
Kane almost yelled. “Legmann — 
why he was the finest research 
chemist — ” 

“But he wasn’t really happy in 
his profession,” Phil said. “As I re- 
call — he just wasn’t well adjusted 
as a research chemist and teacher.” 

“Who said he wasn’t?” 

“Why the Staff.” 

“What Staff—?” 

“Anyway, he’s a plumber now 
somewhere,” Phil said. “He’s happy 
now.” 

Kane felt a coldness on his neck. 
His stomach seemed to turn com- 
pletely over. The devil with this, he 
thought. His eyeballs felt as though 
they were covered with sand, and 
his lids seemed leaded weights. He 
pushed back his chair. 

“You’ll excuse me,” he said. “But 

13 


BRYCE WALTON 



I’m really tired out. I’m going to 
get some rest — ” 

“But the night’s young for us, 
man,” Laura shrieked. 

“We’re having more Scotch,” 
Lucille said, watching him care- 
fully. 

“Fun time’s only starting for us,” 
the young man protested, and the 
fat man and Jenny and all of them 
protested loudly together, laughing 
all the while. 

Kane was backing away. The 
hell with them. He turned and ran 
for the elevator. Then he remem- 
bered that he didn’t know what 
room he was supposed to be checked 
into. He didn’t have a key either. 
He— 

Two smiling men, were on either 
side of him. In a mirror he could 
see the half smiling, half concerned 
faces of Phil and Laura, and the 
slightly sardonic eyes of Lucille. 

“Don’t worry, Gang,” he heard 
Phil say. “We’re taking a Special 
room. We’ll be together again 
soon.” 

“This way,” the two young smil- 
ing men said. They wore uniforms 
and appeared to be bellhops. “We’ll 
show you to our room.” 

The two bellhops started to back 
out of the room. “What’s special 
about it,” Kane asked. “Only thing 
I can see about it that could be 
considered special is that it’s about 
big enough to be someone’s closet! 
I reserved a suite. What kind of a 
run-around is this anyway?” 

It was hardly bigger than a large 
closet. A white room, with only a 
single bed in it, and a bureau. 
Through a narrow, partly open 

14 


door, he could see a bathroom, and 
that was it. 

“Well,” the bellhop said, smiling. 
“It’s our Single.” 

“You mean you call it special 
because it’s a single,” Kane asked. 

The bellhops nodded. 

“Why?” Kane insisted. “What’s 
special about a single?” 

“We only have one single here,” 
the bellhops said. “We hope you 
are comfortable with us, Professor 
Kane.” 

“Look here! Why should you 
only have one single in this entire 
hotel? And what’s so special about 
it?” 

“This single is seldom demanded 
by guests,” the bellhop said. 

“I didn’t demand it. I reserved a 
suite, or at least I understood that 
my friend, Phil Nordson, reserved a 
suite. I certainly didn’t demand 
this!” 

“But — but of course you did. We 
have to have a single when we’re — 
not getting along well with our- 
selves.” 

Kane started for the door, but 
the two men backed out and shut it 
in his face. He tried the knob. The 
door was locked. He turned quickly 
and scanned the room, but there 
was no key visible. Then one of the 
curtains moved as he walked to- 
ward it, and he saw that the narrow 
window was barred. 

As he swept the curtains aside to 
look out through the bars, and 
grabbed at the bars in a kind of 
instinctual gesture, a metal panel 
slid noiselessly across and shut out 
a flash of neon light. 

He was alone, locked up like a 
dangerous madman! 

THE HAPPY HERD 



B Y THE head of the narrow. bed 
that resembled something anti- ' 
septic in a barracks, Kane saw the 
black eye of a phone peeking out 
of a niche in the wall. 

He pulled it out and jabbed at a 
button. His throat felt tight and he 
could feel the pounding of his heart 
as he leaned against the wall. 

“This is Professor Kane, room 

2004 .” 

“Yes, we’re here.” 

“And I’m here! In this ridiculous 
closet. I’m locked in. There must be 
some sort of mistake. The win- 
dow — ” 

“We’ll be all right. We’ll be fine 
in a little while.” 

“Look here — connect me with 
the cocktail lounge. I want to speak 
with Phil Nordson. Yes, he’s 
there — ” 

He heard nothing, absolutely 
nothing, except his own heart. No 
clock in the room either. The walls 
and ceiling had a peculiar grained 
look. 

“Hello, Prof!” 

“Phil! PhU, listen, what in the 
name of God goes on here? I’m 
locked in! You said you reserved a 
suite for me, and this room — ” 

“We aren’t going to worry,” Phil 
said. Kane heard laughter in the 
background and the high-pitched 
choral voices from the jukebox. 
“We’ll be all right. We figured 
there would be a little trouble here 
and there, at first. 

“I don’t give a damn about a 
little trouble there! Phil, I’m talk- 
ing about me, here! I’m locked in. 
And my luggage. Where is it? 
And — ” 

Kane’s stomach jumped. A kind 


of terror hit him like a cold breath. 
“Phil! My briefcase. Where’s my 
briefcase?” 

“We have it somewhere — ” Phil 
was saying. “Just don’t let us wor- 
ry.” 

Kane heard a clicking sound 
somewhere and he yelled into the 
phone but nothing came back. He 
released the phone and it was 
sucked back into the wall. 

He sank down on the bed and 
fumbled absently at his coat and 
then at his necktie. The walls had 
a blurred quality and he felt on the 
edge of passing out. He kept think- 
ing of die briefcase, with years of 
work in it, the equations, more than 
could be preserved entirely in a 
man’s head. 

It was too sickening to think 
about, the possibility of them losing 
his briefcase. Phil didn’t seem con- 
cerned. No one was concerned with 
his briefcase, that was obvious. The 
only thing they were concerned 
about was that he didn’t get along 
with the Gang. 

The hell with the Gang, every 
last one of the Gang. If he never 
heard of the Gang or saw the Gang 
again, he would consider himself 
extremely fortunate. 

He felt numb, too tired to think 
about anything. He fumbled at one 
shoe, got it off, then worked vaguely 
at the other one. He would rest, 
sleep, sleep for a long time, then 
he would be able to think. He might 
find this all exaggerated, unreal, 
once he slept, rested, woke up again. 

A man certainly had rights. 
There was some authority he could 
contact of course. He was just too 
upset to think about it anymore. 


BRYCE WALTON 15 



He had his shirt, his undershirt 
off. He had his shoes and socks off 
and he flexed his feet in ecstasy. He 
unzipped his fly and as he started to 
stand up to take his pants off, he 
groaned with fright and fell back- 
ward onto the bed. 

A chair fused with the bed. Laura 
was there, sitting on the chair, but 
also practically sitting in Kane’s 
lap. 

He blinked rapidly and reached 
out, and his hand moved through 
the image of Laura, only Laura 
seemed solid, three-dimensional, 
very real indeed. Too real. 

“Get out,” he whispered. 
“What — ” 

Glass clinked loudly right in the 
room with him. The jukebox blared. 

Kane couldn’t move. He sat 
rigidly, and the table was there, and 
all the Gang around it, and Phil 
there smiling and they were all 
around Kane drinking Scotch, dou- 
ble shots of Scotch, no ice. 

Lucille looked across the table 
and shook her lovely head slightly. 
There was concern, genuine con- 
cern, a kind of sadness, behind the 
false smile. The smile, he knew, was 
for the others. But the concern was 
for him. 

Phil raised his glass. Nine glasses 
were in the air. 

“Here’s to us, happy Gang, 
Prof,” Phil shouted. 

“Here’s to us! Here’s to Sunny 
Hill!” they shouted. 

Kane slowly moistened his lips. 
The three walls and the ceiling had 
come alive. They were actually 
huge TV screens, and the effect 
was startlingly three-dimensional. 
Only the absence of touch could 

16 


break the illusion. But the visual 
and the audial made up for the ab- 
sence of touch. Kane didn’t want 
to touch them anyway. He wanted 
them to go away, altogether. 

His room was crammed with 
phantoms from the cocktail lounge. 
In fact, his room was fused with 
the cocktail lounge. It was all there 
somehow. 

“Go to sleepy-bye,” Laura whis- 
pered and made a very suggestive 
gesture. Her cheeks were flushed as 
she leaned into and through him. 

“Take ourselves a good long 
snooze,” Phil grinned. “Don’t wor- 
ry. The Gang’s all here.” 

Lucille said, hardly smiling at all. 
“No, don’t worry, Professor. We’ll 
all sleep with you.” 

He zipped his pants back up and 
slid back through several phantom 
shapes and pressed against the wall. 
“Phil,” he finally said. “Phil!” 
“Aren’t you sleepy now?” Phil 
asked. 

“He’s sleepy,” Laura said. “We’re 
sleeping with you, Professor man.” 
“Yes, yes I am sleepy. Goodnight 
now,” Kane said. “Goodnight.” 

He waited. They didn’t take the 
hint. To them it was no hint at all. 
He knew they weren’t going away. 
He knew that no matter what he 
said or did, they wouldn’t go away. 
That was the thing he understood, 
incredible as it was, he knew now 
that no matter what he said or did, 
they wouldn’t go away. 

They only understood that he 
was somehow ill. He knew that too. 
They were right, so he was wrong. 
They thought they were doing what 
was best for him. That was obvious. 
It was all over their faces and 


THE HAPPY HERD 



actions. If they had any idea how 
he felt, they still considered his 
feelings only symptoms of some 
kind, and they seemed confident 
that Kane would soon be all right. 

But his being all right had noth- 
ing to do with their going away. 

Kane decided not to give way, 
not to scream or anything absurd 
like that. It wouldn’t do any good. 
Calm, be calm and — well maybe 
just try pretending they’re not there 
at all. 

Then he remembered the bath- 
room and ran through several 
chairs, a table, and three people, 
and into the bathroom. He slammed 
the door and leaned against it and 
let out a long relieved breath. 

He was taking off his shorts when 
the bathroom walls and the ceiling 
came alive. 

What had been labeled “Boy’s 
Room” down in the cocktail lounge 
was being projected into the bath- 
room of room 2004. 

It wasn’t false modesty that 
prompted Kane’s moan. It wasn’t 
any form of prudishness that moved 
Kane to clutch his undershorts to 
his body and leap into the shower 
stall. 

It was a panicky realization of 
the absolutely involuntary nature of 
the way things were. Strangers, 
with friendly smiles, everywhere 
around him all the time, and he, 
Larry Kane, had nothing — abso~ 
lutely nothing to say about it. 

The shower stall with the pulled 
curtain was no refuge either. There 
was a superimposed sink in there 
on the wall with a phantom shape 
using an electric razor, 

Phil and Ben were leaning 

BRYCE WALTON 


through the shower curtain. They 
weren’t there for anything specific. 
They were just there, chatting, smil- 
ing, bantering. 

Others came in and out of the 
“Boy’s Room” of the cocktail 
lounge. Everyone said hello, or di- 
rected some sort of friendly com- 
ment casually at Kane as though 
superimposed washrooms were the 
quintessence of social normalcy. 
And, Kane thought pushing hard at 
panic, they probably were. 

Phil and Ben were there for no 
other reason than to keep Kane 
company. To help him. He could 
see that. No matter how tortured he 
seemed, their attitude remained 
that of beneficence. The trouble 
was all his, and they gave no indica- 
tion of seeing his side of anything. 

Evidently, to them, being alone 
was the worst thing that could hap- 
pen to anybody. If he wanted to be 
alone then he was wrong, he was 
sick, he was put in a special room. A 
single. But they wouldn’t go away. 

He managed to turn on the 
shower, and he turned his face up 
to the icy water and closed his eyes 
and imagined he was back in 
blessed isolation in the study of the 
observatory on the Moon. But it 
was a long long way back to the 
Moon. 

It worked both ways. He could 
see and hear them. They could hear 
and see him too, but he determined 
to do his best to ignore them. The 
idea of social amenities no longer 
bothered Kane. Being impolite was 
an absurdity. Social decency was a 
mutual thing, and these people 
weren’t considering his rights at all. 

He finished his shower and 

17 



draped the towel around his waist 
and went back out into the closet 
they had given him. He walked to- 
ward the bed, sidestepping people, 
chairs, tables still unable to realize 
fully that these things weren’t really 
here. 

The jukebox got louder. A cou- 
ple danced through him. Suddenly, 
Kane stood shivering, a raw panic 
taking hold. Control fled before 
the rising jukebox clangor, the 
laughter, the waving and shouting 
and hideous unwelcome demons of 
camaraderie. 

He felt himself wildly waving his 
arms about and shouting at the 
walls. 

“Get out! For God’s sake get out 
and let me sleep!” 

Ben was staring at Kane from 
only a few inches away. 

“You,” Kane pointed a finger at 
the three dimensional ghost. “You 
— fade out, go away somewhere. 
No — no, Phil, not you. Get these 
other people out. I want to talk to 
you — Phil — ” 

“Easy now,” Phil said soothingly. 
“We’ll be all right. In a little while 
now — ” 

“I am all right, but I won’t be if 
I can’t sleep. Phil — can’t all this 
just — just be tuned out or some- 
thing?” 

Kane tried to imagine none of 
the others were there. Just the small 
room, himself, and Phil. But the 
others were all looking at Kane, all 
of them looking, all of them smil- 
ing. Lucille was looking too, but 
somehow he was sure he could see 
a reflection of his own feelings in 
her eyes, hidden, but there. 

“We’ll be with you all the way,” 

18 


Phil said. 

“But how can I sleep with a 
cocktail lounge full of people all 
over my bed? Tell me. I’m listen- 
ing. Tell me how!” 

Phil’s smile disappeared com- 
pletely for a brief second. He whis- 
pered, close to Kane’s ear. “Try to 
do it, Larry. Please — try!” 

Kane ran to the wall, clicked the 
light switch. He knew that the 
lights in his room went out, but 
the slightly dimmer lights projected 
from the cocktail lounge remained. 
Somehow, that was even worse. It 
seemed to resemble the implacable 
characters of a persisting night- 
mare. Subdued, with the coruscat- 
ing bubbling play of multicolored 
light from the jukebox turning a 
rainbow over and over the ceiling 
and the bed, and the Gang, the 
Gang all there like ghosts with 
greenish faces smiling, sitting, whis- 
pering round the bed. 

Kane threw himself on the bed 
and covered his eyes with his arms. 

He was going mad with fatigue, 
and yet he knew he could never 
sleep, never rest, under these cir- 
cumstances. It wasn’t just the fig- 
ures there, the lights, the laughter 
and whispering and the chorus 
breaking from the jukebox. It was 
what their being there really meant, 
the suggestion of the bigger cause 
behind what was happening to 
Kane. 

A man who fears to sleep in the 
dark is not really afraid of the dark. 
But of what is hiding in it. 

Shadows moved above his closed 
lids. Glass tinkled with ice cubes. 
Under his sweating forearm, his 

THE HAPPY HERD 



eyes throbbed and his body felt as 
though the skin had been scraped 
all over until it was raw* 

Kane propped himself on an 
elbow, and looked to one side at 
Phil. Phil grinned sympathetically. 
Laura was in the same cushioned 
chair, but she seemed to be sitting 
beside Kane on the bed. Lucille was 
avoiding looking at Kane. 

“Phil.” 

“Well, Prof, we thought we were 
getting our sleep!” 

“No,” Kane whispered. “I can’t 
sleep. I’m asking you, you Phil, and 
all the rest of you, to let me sleep. 
I’m asking you to help me in that 
way, just for a while. I’m imploring 
you really to just tune yourselves 
out for a while and let me sleep.” 

There was something blank, un- 
comprehending in the way they 
smiled at him. Kane knew then 
that they could never allow them- 
selves to try to understand his situa- 
tion, because then they might ques- 
tion their own. For example, if 
they’ve taken refuge in one another 
from a terrible fear of insecurity, 
anxiety, and aloneness, then Kane 
could only represent the threat of 
reawakened fear. 

What was the use? 

“We’ll turn the lights down low, 
how would that be, Prof?” Phil 
asked. 

“We’d like that,” Laura whis- 
pered. 

“Don’t be afraid, we’re with 
you,” Ben said. 

“We’ll sing you into dreamland,” 
Jenny said. 

“Don’t be afraid. We’re all to- 
gether and our Gang is with you,” 
someone else said. It didn’t matter 


who really, Kane thought, because 
they all spoke not as individuals but 
as the Gang. 

“Through sunshine and in shad- 
ow,” Lucille said. 

The lights dimmed slowly as 
Kane curled up on the bed and 
clenched his eyes shut. He pulled 
the sheet up over his face. He 
pressed his fingers into his ears. 
But it wouldn’t work. Nothing like 
that would do any good. You 
couldn’t shut off indignity such as 
this. You couldn’t block out such an 
intrusion of spirit and human dig- 
nity by burying your head, or press- 
ing your ears. 

You could try, but not very long, 
not when you knew it wouldn’t do 
any good. 

He had no idea now what time 
it was, how long he had been here. 
He had tried to spot a wall clock 
somewhere in the cocktail lounge, 
but none was within view. That 
didn’t help either, this timeless 
feeling. That only enhanced the 
similarity it all had to a persisting 
nightmare. 

It was a gnawing murmur all 
around him. It was like a hollow 
tooth. The softened sounds of their 
voices going on and on was mad- 
dening because they were softened. 
Softened for him, yet they were still 
there. He felt like an irritated baby 
sleeping while adults talked, pre- 
tending to soften their voices. 

His body was slimy with sweat, 
and his head pounded with a dull 
ache. He jumped out of bed and 
ran straight through Laura to the 
wall and jerked the phone from 
its slot. 

He yelled into it. 


BRYCE WALTON

“This is Professor Larry Kane. 
Room 2004. I’m checking out. Send 
someone up here with a key! I said 
send someone up here . .” 

“We understand, Professor 
Kane.” 

“Then you’ll send someone up 
immediately with a key!” 

“Please don’t get upset. The Staff 
has been busy, but now the Staff 
will soon be with you.” 

The Staff . 

“I just want a key, I want to 
get the hell out of here!” 

Kane yelled several times into 
the phone after the click, but no 
voice came back. He had grabbed 
up the table, the metal table at the 
head of the bed, and flung it into 
the wall before he realized what he 
was doing. 

The shadows moved toward him. 
Phil, Laura, Ben, Jetiny, Lawrence, 
Lucille, all the others, nameless, 
what did it matter anyway, their 
names? 

They were smiling, holding out 
their arms to him. Compassionate, 
sympathy, they had it all. All they 
wanted to do was help him. 

He ran through them back to- 
ward the bathroom. It was still full 
of men from the downstairs john. 
“What time is it?” Kane yelled at 
someone with a paper towel pressed 
to his eyes. 

“’Bout three I’d say, what a 
night!” 

“Three—” 

Three o’clock in the morning, 
but the fact was Kane wasn’t sure 
about the day. He backed out of 
the bathroom, slammed the door. 

“The Staff is ready, Prof,” Phil 
said. 

20 


“We’re all with you, aren’t we?” 
Laura giggled. 

The closet. 

Kane ran into the closet and 
slammed the door. There was some- 
thing immediately cozy in the nar- 
row black confines of the closet. 
Either closet walls weren’t TV 
screens, or they had decided to let 
him sleep at last. Probably the 
former. Better convert closets to 
Television. In case kiddies misbe- 
have and get locked in the closet, 
they’ll not be alone in there . 

He curled up on the floor in the 
pitch blackness and almost immedi- 
ately began to drift off into sleep. 
The narrow darkness tightened 
around him like a thick comforting 
blanket on a cold night . 

Sometime later — he had no idea 
how much time had passed — a light 
was blinking at his lids. He opened 
them slowly and stared into a 
flickering yellow eye. 

A doorhinge creaked. Up there 
somewhere a voice said pleasantly: 

“Professor Kane, your Staff is 
here.” 

“Staff?” he whispered, trying to 
see above the blinking light. 

“We’re here.” 


T HE TV walls were dead now, 
but that was hardly consoling. 
The overhead light was glaring 
with an intense whiteness. The 
three members of the Staff were 
busy, and Kane was being Tested. 

Kane had emerged from the 
closet determined to remain as ra- 
tional as possible, to control his 
emotions, and find out what he 
could about his human rights as an 

THE HAPPY HERD 



individual. 

That was easy to find out and 
only required a few questions 
honestly and frankly answered. 

As a minority, Kane had no 
rights whatsoever. 

He had one big right, the right 
to think as the majority did. But 
that didn’t count for much yet be- 
cause Kane was ill, maladjusted 
and had anti-group feeling. 

The Staff was going to test him, 
find out what was wrong with 
Kane. And this of course implied 
that when they found out what was 
wrong, the difficulty would be taken 
care of. 

The Staff was kind, considerate, 
almost excessively polite consider- 
ing the circumstances. They were 
young efficient men with crewcuts, 
briefcases, and wearing tight con- 
servative dark suits. Only slight dif- 
ferences in build distinguished them 
one from another, but this super- 
ficial outward difference only 
seemed to emphasize the Staffs 
basic unity, its Group Spirit, its 
Staff Consciousness. 

Every public institution, every 
business establishment, every school, 
club, hotel, factory, office building 
— in short, everywhere that people 
congregated in official Groups, 
there was a regular Staff on duty 
twenty-four hours a day. 

They were Integrators. Glorified 
personnel men. 

Electrodes were clamped on 
Kane’s head and wrists. Something 
was strapped around his chest. 
Wires ran into a miniature Reacto. 
A stylus began to make jagged lines 
on a strip of moving tape. 

“We’re getting a complete per- 

BRYCE WALTON 


sonality checkup,” the Staff said. 

It was indeed complete. It was 
as complete as a personality check- 
up could be short of an actual dis- 
section. 

Kane looked at countless ink- 
blots. He was shown a great many 
pictures and whether he answered 
verbally or not was of no concern 
of the Staff. 

Whatever his reactions were, they 
were all analyzed by the machines. 
Words weren’t necessary. The Staff 
had a shortcut to personality check- 
ups. From the mind right into the 
machine. 

The Staff only interpreted the 
results, or maybe they didn’t even 
do that. It was more likely that 
machines did that too. 

Kane protested for a while, but 
he was too tired to protest very 
long. He asked them a great many 
questions, and they answered them 
willingly enough — up to a point. 
They were interested in his ques- 
tions too. He was an interesting 
symptom, but actually he knew that 
they already had him pretty well 
tabbed. 

They answered his questions the 
way big-hearted adults answered 
inquisitive children. 

“We must,” the Staff said, “de- 
termine why you don’t fit in.” 

Kane talked about his work, his 
theories, his years of devotion to 
what he had always considered to 
be a contribution to society. They 
hardly seemed interested. What 
good was all that — astronomy and 
such — when a man was not happy 
with others? 

“What about this aversion to 
people?” the Staff said, in a kindly 

21 



way. ‘‘This — well — clinically, this 
de-grouping syndrome. This an- 
tagonism to the group spirit.” 
“You mean my reaction to Phil 
and his friends?” 

“Your friends. Your Group,” 
The Staff said. 

“But I don’t dislike those peo- 
ple,” Kane insisted. “Certainly, I 
have no aversion to them! Hell, I 
don’t even know them.” 

“But they’re people,” the Staff 
said. “Part of the family of man.” 
“I know that. But I was tired 
and wanted to sleep!” 

“You’ll find the true group 
Spirit,” the Staff said. “Let us ask 
you this, Professor Kane. If you 
really had no aversion to people 
generally, why would you object to 
them being with you? Why should 
the presence of people disturb your 
sleep? Wouldn’t a Healthy person 
enjoy sleeping with others merely 
because they were there? Doesn’t 
one sleep best among friends, know- 
ing he isn’t alone, knowing even his 
sleep is shared — ” 

There was a great deal more, but 
it all boiled down to the same thing. 
Kane was wrong. 

And he didn’t have the right to 
be wrong. 

They, or rather it, the Staff, 
seemed to concentrate on the whole 
question of why Kane had ever 
volunteered for a job demanding 
extreme isolation in the first place. 
The point was that apparently 
Kane had been anti-social, a Group 
Spirit deviant from the beginning. 

Kane tried to explain it, calmly 
at first, then more emotionally. 
Either way, he knew that whatever 

22 


he said was only additional grist 
to their syndrome recording mill. 
Being alone in order to do certain 
kinds of work demanding isolation 
seemed to be beside the point. 

The point was that being on the 
Moon deprived a man of Groups. 
It was a kind of psychological sui- 
cide. Now that he was back home 
they would straighten him out. The 
question of returning to the Moon 
was ignored. To them, this was an 
absurdity. What did Kane want? 

Kane was in no position to know 
what he really wanted — yet. They 
were going to help him decide what 
he really wanted. But they already 
knew that. It only remained for 
Kane to agree with them. 

The majority was always right. 

He explained his values to them. 
They listened. He told them that 
as far as he was concerned the 
social setup was now deadly, a kind 
of self-garrisoned mental concen- 
tration camp in which free thought 
was impossible. A stagnate, in fact 
a regressive state of affairs. Pro- 
ficiency in skills would go, science 
would die. A herd state. Individual- 
ity lost. Depersonalized. Tyranny of 
the Majority. Integration mania. 
Collective thinking. Mass media. 
Lilliput against Leviathan . 

But Kane wasn’t happy, that was 
the important thing wasn’t it? 

Could a knowledge of how rapid- 
ly the Universe was expanding con- 
tribute to the happiness of a human 
being living on Madison Avenue in 
Manhattan? 

Obviously the answer to that was 
no. 

Kane was going to be happy. He 
wouldn’t concern himself with the 


THE HAPPY HERD 



stars any more. He wouldn’t prac- 
tice a self-imposed barren isolation 
of himself any more. Kane was 
going to be happy. He was going to 
be one of the Group. 

Time went by. He was given 
sedatives. He slept at last. He 
awoke and was tested and went to 
sleep again, many times. He was 
fed too, given injections with 
needles of energy and vitamins and 
proteins and glucose and carbohy- 
drates, because he refused to eat any 
other way. 

Vaguely he remembered episodes 
of babbling under the influence of 
hypnotic drugs. 

He kept remembering the brief- 
case. In a dream the Group had it, 
throwing it around among them 
like a basketball. The clasp broke. 
The papers, thousands of papers 
spilled out and drifted away over 
New York and Kane was running 
through a maze looking up at them 
and then he was lost. 

Now he knew what had hap- 
pened to the other Moon ships, and 
to the rest of the Captain’s crew, 
where they had gone to and never 
come back from. 

Space was lonely and dark. Space 
was empty. Space was frightening. 

They had gone back to the close- 
ness and warmth and security of 
their Group. 

How many were there left such 
as the Captain, and Kane — Kane 
for a while yet perhaps? How many 
were there? 

Could he escape? 

At some unrelated point on the 
Testing chart, the Staff closed up 
their briefcases, politely said good- 
bye, and left. 

BRYCE WALTON 


The data would be run through 
more machines. 

Kane would be happy. 

All he had to do was wait. 

K ANE AWOKE with a galvanic 
start and stared at the prison 
of his room. 

The walls began coming alive. 
Phil, Laura, Lucille, Herby, Cla- 
rence, Jenny, Ben, the happy happy 
Group, always there, always wait- 
ing, always reliable, sharing every- 
thing, pleasure and pain. 

“How we feeling now, Prof,” 
Phil yelled. He was stark naked. 

“You look so cuddly,” Laura 
giggled, and for an instant there, 
Kane could almost feel her snug- 
gling in beside him. 

Kane lay there in a dim super- 
imposed puzzle of furniture, moving 
forms, comers of rooms jutting out 
of the wrong walls, bodies walking 
through beds and one another, and 
then a naked figure curving into the 
air, falling toward him in a graceful 
arc, down, getting larger and larger, 
plunging right for Kane’s face. 

Kane rolled frantically. And then 
somewhere under him he heard a 
splash and there was the vague rip- 
ple of unreal water as Phil swam 
away across his cool blue pool. 

There — that was Laura, only in 
a boudoir, standing before a mirror 
wearing only a pair of very brief 
panties, and nothing else. Her re- 
flection in the mirror smiled at 
Kane as she brushed her hair. 

“Morning, Prof honey. How we 
feeling this morning?” 

It was morning. Some morning 
on some day during some year. 

23 



There was Lucille on this morn- 
ing lying in a sunchair, her black 
hair shining in the sunlight some- 
where. Probably in the Group house 
at Sunny Hill. In a while now, 
Kane knew, the Group would all 
go away together to their office, 
and they would do their work, con- 
centrating on getting along together 
until they could return to Sunny 
Hill together. 

Lucille was reading a newspaper, 
and she glanced up at Kane. There 
was a pale line around her mouth 
and she pulled her eyes quickly 
away as though she didn’t want to 
look at him. She wasn’t like the 
others. She was different. Of course. 
It had to be a matter of degree. 
Nothing was black and white. 
There had to be differences of 
opinion, some degree of individual- 
ity — somehow. Somewhere. Perhaps 
Lucille — 

“Good morning, good morning 
to all of us!” Kane shouted sud- 
denly. 

“Did we have a good rest, Prof?” 

Phil was yelling from his pool. 
He seemed greatly pleased with 
Kane’s enthusiastic social response. 
Not that Kane was really trying to 
fool anybody. He was pretty sure 
the Staff wouldn’t be fooled. Some- 
where the machines were scanning 
the data. Soon, the Staff would 
have a full analysis of Kane, what 
was wrong, and what would make 
it right. What he should have done, 
and what he should be. 

Jenny and Ben were making love 
on a couch. Kane tried to keep on 
watching them as though he suf- 
fered no embarrassment, but it was 
impossible. 

24 


“I’ve a full schedule planned for 
today,” Phil yelled up. “Soon we’ll 
all be going to the Office. You’ll be 
going with us soon too, Prof!” 

He would belong to the happy 
Group. Sharing everything. But 
maybe it wouldn’t be this happy 
Group. Maybe the machines would 
decide that he belonged in some 
other Group. Whatever Group it 
was it would be happy. That was a 
fact. 

Could he escape ? Could he, per- 
haps, get back to the La Guardia 
Pits, and the Captain of the Moon- 
ship? 

The windows still barred, pan- 
eled in metal. The door locked. If 
he managed to get out of this Sin- 
gle, say, and out of the Midtown 
Hotel, and into the street, then 
what? 

That didn’t matter. If he could 
only get that far — 

Laura was standing there naked, 
close to Kane. “We’re having our 
wedding at five,” she whispered. 

“Who?” Kane said, startled. 

“Ben and Jenny. They’re right 
for all of us together.” 

From a number of rooms, people 
were watching Ben and Jenny being 
right for all of us together, but 
Kane couldn’t look. 

“See us all,” Laura shouted and 
dived through the floor. A spray of 
water spilled up and fell unfelt 
through Kane’s flinching torso. Ben 
and Jenny ran away. 

Kane was practically alone with 
Lucille. It was the first time in 
he had no idea now how long that 
he had been this much alone with 
any one other person. 

She glanced rather sadly at Kane 

THE HAPPY HERD 



above the paper she was reading. 

“You know how I feel, Lucie?” 

She nodded, almost impercep- 
tibly. 

“How can you stand it, all the 
time this way?” he asked. 

“Some of us learn to be in it, 
with a part of us out of it. A kind 
of self -hypnosis, a retreat of some 
kind. Into fantasy, that’s what it 
really is. But — but I don’t think any 
of us can keep on doing it forever. 
We will all give way completely — 
sooner or later.” 

“I’ve got to get out,” Kane said. 
“Do you want to get out?” 

“It’s impossible to get out.” 

“I’ve got to try.” 

“What’s the use of trying if you 
know you can’t get away? Where 
can anyone go?” 

“There must be people who break 
away,” Kane said. “There have to 
be.” 

“There’s supposed to be an un- 
derground, some secret group of 
some kind that helps people get 
out.” 

“Get out — where? Out of the 
country?” 

“It’s pretty much like this every- 
where. But there are supposed to be 
areas where it isn’t. Islands some- 
where. Hidden places right here in 
the country. Supposed to be places 
in the Kentucky Mountains, and in 
New Mexico, places like that.” 

“The Moon,” Kane said. “That’s 
a place I know of. I’ve been there.” 

Her eyes were bright for a mo- 
ment. “I know. It must have been 
wonderful. Why on Earth did you 
ever leave?” 

“I didn’t know what it was like 
here. And — my wife died. I wanted 

BRYCE WALTON 


and needed another wife. More 
than a wife really. Someone who 
could share that kind of a life with 
me, someone who would be in- 
terested in the work too.” 

She turned quickly back to the 
paper. 

“You might be able to get out of 
the hotel,” she said. “But you would 
be too conspicuous.” 

“Because I would be traveling 
alone?” 

“Yes.” 

“If you came with me, there 
would be two of us. We wouldn’t be 
conspicuous that way.” 

He saw the flush move up 
through her face. “Is that the only 
reason?” 

“You know it isn’t.” 

She knew it. They both knew it 
and had probably known it for a 
long time. They had a lot in com- 
mon, a minority of two. 

And then he remembered. She 
wasn’t really there in the Mid town 
with him. She was in Sunny Hill, 
wherever that was. They couldn’t 
leave inconspicuously together be- 
cause they weren’t together now, 
and they couldn’t get together with- 
out the Gang being together too. 

The rooms, furniture, sounds, 
everything began to fade. 
“Goodbye,” Lucille said. 

“Get sick or something,” Kane 
said quickly. “Don’t go with the 
Group to work. Stay there, wher- 
ever you are! Stay there — ” 

Faintly, her voice came to him 
out of a kind of melting mask of a 
face. “I’ll try—” 

Kane was alone in the single 
room the door opened. The smiling 
Staff came in and shut the door. 

25 



The three of them stood there 
happily holding their briefcases. 

“We’re happy to report that we 
have completed your personality 
breakdown.” 

The word was a bit premature, 
Kane thought. “What is it?” he 
asked. 

“Excellent,” the Staff beamed. 
“You should never have been an 
astronomer. You took up that pro- 
fession as a way of escaping from 
people. Actually, of course, you 
love people and hate your profes- 
sion. 

“Have you determined what I 
should be if not an astronomer?” 

“Naturally, it’s all in the break- 
down.” 

“What is it?” 

“Generally, you prefer physical 
work, not mental work. Mental 
work is a constant strain on your 
psychological balance. You have 
done it neurotically to reinforce 
your need to avoid people.” 

“Physical work? What kind?” 

“Specifically, it seems that you 
are best suited for the profession of 
plumbing.” 

“Plumbing?” Kane said. 
‘Tlumbing what?” 

“Plumbing, the art of pipe-fit- 
ting, the study of water mains, 
sewage lines, and so forth.” 

“Plumbing.” Kane said. 

“Of course, you react antago- 
nistically to it now. But that will be 
changed.” 

Kane had nothing against 
plumbers or plumbing. Once, as a 
kid, he remembered having a long 
interesting talk with a plumber who 
was unstopping the kitchen sink. He 
had fascinating tools, and at that 

26 


time, Kane had said he would be a 
plumber when he grew up. But he 
had also wanted to be any number 
of other things when he grew up, 
including an astronomer. 

Now he had no desire whatso- 
ever to be a plumber. 

Kane drew the metal bedside 
table up hard and the edge of it 
caught number one of the Staff 
under the chin. Kane attacked, 
violently. He did it knowing that 
something more was at stake than 
his life — his identity. 

Number one fell down on his 
knees and whimpered. He wasn’t 
hit hard. But he squatted there 
blubbering as though he had suf- 
fered some horrible shock. Numbers 
two and three gaped as though 
equally shocked without ever hav- 
ing been hit at all. 

That was Kane’s initial advan- 
tage. The Staff seemed incapable 
of understanding that anyone 
would do what Kane was doing. 
Kane hit number two four times 
before number two covered up 
his face with his hands and started 
to cry. Kane ran him into the closet 
and locked the door. 

Number three swung his briefcase 
at Kane’s head, fluttering his other 
hand wildly. Kane was heavier 
than he should have been because 
he was accustomed to the Moon. 
But he was desperate and that was 
some compensation. He had some 
experience, a very little, as a boxer 
in college, but that had been years 
ago. But as little experience as he 
had at this sort of thing, he was 
way ahead of number three. Num- 
ber three kept swinging his brief- 

THE HAPPY HERD 



case, and Kane hit him on the chin 
and then in the stomach and then 
on the back of the neck. Number 
three lay unconscious on the floor. 

Kane stared at his bleeding 
knuckles a moment, then dragged 
Number one up onto his feet. 

“You’re going to help me,” Kane 
said. “We’re getting a saucer and 
then we’re going to Sunny Hill. 
You know where Sunny Hill is?” 
Number one ran his hand nerv- 
ously through his dark brushcut He 
had a boyish face that seemed 
deeply insulted by what Kane had 
done. Insulted and shocked as 
though he had been a good boy all 
his life and then someone had 
slapped his hand — for no reason at 
all. 

Kane doubled his fists. Number 
one winced and looked shocked 
again, and very frightened. A great 
deal more frightened than anyone 
would be who was afraid only of 
physical injury. 

“Yes, that’s part of a big Group 
Housing Project downtown.” 
“Where can we get a saucer?” 
“The roof.” 

“Unlock the door,” Kane said. 
“And just pretend everything is 
happy and that we’re relating beau- 
tifully to one another. Now listen — 
I’ll kill you if you try anything else. 
I hope you believe it because I 
really will. What you fellows intend 
doing with me, as far as I’m con- 
cerned, is worse than murder.” 
They stepped onto one of several 
saucers decorating the roof of the 
Midtown Hotel. The rotary blades 
in the ten foot platform whirred 
under them, and Kane felt the 
saucer rise up to a thousand feet, 

BRYCE WALTON 


then dip downtown. The air was 
full of them and only some kind of 
sixth-sense seemed to keep them 
from jamming into one another. 

There was never less than two 
on a saucer. And Kane noticed that 
most of the saucers were flying in 
Groups like aimless geese. 

Kane jumped from the saucer 
and ran across the roof landing of 
the Sunny Hill project building. 
There were a number of them like 
huge blocks arranged in some in- 
comprehensible plan. 

Kane glanced back to see num- 
ber one leaping from the saucer and 
running in the opposite direction. 
Kane ran on toward the elevator. 
He knew he didn’t have much time, 
but what bothered him was the 
authority he was running against. 
Public opinion was a general atti- 
tude, not a cop car, or a squad of 
officers with guns. Getting out of 
line, Kane figured, was usually its 
own punishment — isolation, loneli- 
ness, social ostracism. 

But what about the exception? 
The guy who fought conformity 
and the majority opinion. 

Who would they put on Kane? 
Or what? It would help to know 
what he was running from. What 
concrete force or power would try 
to stop him. 

Then he saw her running toward 
him. 

Her face was flushed and the 
wind blew her dress tightly against 
her slim body as she stopped and 
looked at him. 

He took hold of her arm. 

“We’ve got to hurry,” she said. 
“The Group knows I’ve run away.

Illustrated by Ed Emsh 

What had caused the people of the crystal city to perish ? 
And why had their remains disappeared so completely 
that not even their bones were left? 

ROOM WITH VIEW 

BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 




T HE PLANET was a shining 
sphere of crystalline cause and 
effect. It was the sound of glass 
chimes in a summer wind captured 
and set to architecture. It was the 
only child of a lonely star, and it 
was moonless. It was also dead. 

Donant didn’t know how long 
he’d been walking. An hour, per- 
haps. Maybe longer. There was a 
timelessness about the eternal streets 
and the endless edifices, and he’d 
left his watch in the ship, remem- 
bering only his compass. But the 
compass was by far the more im- 
portant item: with its needle never 
deviating from the magnetic lode 
in the ship’s heart, he could never 
get lost — not even in a city that 
covered an entire planet. 

Not even in a dead city. 

Donant was a cartographer and 
much of his life had been spent in 
the unexplored sectors of the galaxy 
where civilizations were rare and 
cities even rarer. Nevertheless he 
was used to cities. He knew the 
Cities of the Plane intimately — the 
metropolises of Mars and Venus 
and the collective edifices of Earth. 
But he was used to cities with 
limited boundaries, not cities that 
covered whole land masses and 
linked crystalline arms across seas. 
Moreover he was used to cities with 
people in them. 

He came presently to a structure 
more striking than the others. Like 
them it was constructed of a crystal- 
like material and seemed to have 
been cast from a single gigantic 
mold ; but there was a quality about 
it that set it aside. Gazing up at the 
prismatic facade, Donant got the 
impression that the long dead archi- 


tect had used an emotional rather 
than an architectural blueprint. 

The facade transformed the 
afternoon sunlight into a trillion 
shifting rainbows. Poignant lines 
blended together to form a frozen 
waterfall of windows and balconies, 
cornices and ledges. The effect was 
dazzling. It was also tinselly. 
Donant wondered why. 

Just before him was the entrance, 
a huge triangle cut into the base of 
the waterfall. There were no doors. 
Donant hesitated a moment, then 
climbed the crystalline stairs and 
entered the building. 

The huge chamber into which he 
stepped should have awed him, but 
it didn’t. The light of day seeping 
colorfully through the prismatic 
walls was abetted by a cluster of 
blazing lights suspended from the 
dome. In the center of the floor 
a lofty statue stood upon a square 
pedestal, and around the pedestal 
were circular rows of chairs. Beyond 
the chairs, balconies rose, tier on 
tier, to the point where the walls 
ended and the dome began. Every- 
thing — chairs, statue, walls, dome — 
was constructed of the same crys- 
talline substance, everything was 
immaculate — and everything was 
dead. 

A council room, Donant thought. 
Perhaps the council room. 

He chose an aisle and walked 
down it to the pedestal. The chairs 
substantiated the evidence of the 
doors and windows of the other 
buildings he had passed: the race 
that had built the city had been 
humanoid and of approximately 
the same stature as Earthmen. 

The pedestal turned out to be a 


29 



speaker’s platform as well as the 
base for the statue; steps were cut 
into it for the convenience of the 
speaker. Donant did not climb the 
steps. There was nothing he had 
to say, and even if there had been, 
there was no one to whom he could 
have said it. Instead he stood at the 
end of the aisle, gazing up at the 
statue. 

The statue represented a woman, 
a beautiful woman. Alien though 
her beauty was, Donant was im- 
pressed by it. Her body was thin, 
but unmistakably mammalian. Her 
features were small, almost tiny, 
yet exquisite in their flawless per- 
fection. She was wearing a simple 
white tunic and the exposed areas 
of her flesh were tinted — no, per- 
meated — with the pink-gold flush 
of living human tissue. For a mo- 
ment Donant almost forgot he was 
looking at a statue. 

Her pose intrigued him. Her right 
arm hung gracefully at her side, 
but her left arm was raised, and 
suspended from her fragile fingers 
at a level with her eyes was a hori- 
zontal bar. Suspended from the bar, 
in turn, were two shallow cups, one 
at each end. The bar was slightly 
canted, and one of the cups was 
lower than the other. 

Scales, Donant thought. Primi- 
tive scales. 

He craned his neck to see their 
contents, but he was too close to 
the pedestal. He walked back up 
the aisle to the entrance, turned 
and tried again. The angle was still 
wrong: all he could see was a 
sparkle in one scale and a flash of 
green in the other. 

He found stairs that led to the 

30 


balconies, climbed them. He went 
as high as he could, to the begin- 
ning of the dome itself. Then he 
looked at the scales again. This time 
their contents were clearly visible. 

In one of them, the lower, heavier 
one, was a dazzling crystalline cube. 
In the other, the one found wanting 
in the balance, was a green knife. 

Curiosity had motivated Donant’s 
landing. Extinct planetary cultures 
were none of his business. None of 
his official business, anyway. But 
he liked cultural problems, and he 
particularly liked this one. A dead 
city, a crystalline cube, and a green 
knife . 

In the street again, walking, he 
attacked the problem. The planet 
was dead; therefore the inhabitants 
had either left it or perished on it. 
If the first alternative were the case, 
then they must have had space 
travel. 

Donant shook his head. A race of 
people, in order to develop space 
travel, must have stepping stones. 
Its imagination has to mature 
gradually. Without the moon as the 
first stepping stone man might not 
have been able to reach Venus and 
Mars. Without Venus and Mars it 
was extremely doubtful if he could 
have reached Mercury and Pluto; 
and without the confidence that 
those first stepping stones gave him, 
the prospect of traveling over four 
light years to Alpha Centauri would 
have overawed him, crippled his as 
yet immature imagination, and he 
would have gone on living on 
Earth, crowding himself into ever 
expanding cities, turning the energy 
that would have gone into the

building of better and better space- 
craft into the building of better and 
better buildings, into the creation 
of better and better building 
materials, till at last he found the 
ultimate material and with it, pos- 
sibly, his justification for existence. 

This planet had no moon. It was 
the only offspring of its sun, and 
the nearest star was forty-one light 
years away. No, Donant concluded, 
its inhabitants definitely had not 
had space travel. 

That left alternative number 
two: the inhabitants had perished, 
every single one of them, and so 
completely that not even their bones 
remained. 

Why? 

Donant stared at the shining 
streets and the immaculate build- 
ings. The gentle throb of entombed 
machines coursed rhythmically 
through the crystalline bricks be- 
neath his feet. But the streets were 
as devoid of life as they were of 
dust, and the doors of the buildings 
were closed, the windows faceless. 

Plague? W eltschmerz? Moral de- 
cay? Donant shook his head again. 

His directionless walk had 
brought him to a different sector of 
the city. The buildings here were 
slightly more functional in appear- 
ance, but they were facsimiles of 
each other and they stood shoulder 
to shoulder like rows of pretty girls, 
each with the same make-up, the 
same girth of bust and buttock, and 
the same stereotyped smile. At the 
base of each, on a level with the 
street, was a little sunken doorway 
fringed with crystalline lattice. 

Apartment houses, Donant 
thought. Or at least their equiva- 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 


lent. Coincidentally with the 
thought came another thought: 
when a problem as a whole proves 
insoluble, concentrate on a single 
aspect of the problem. In this case, 
a single building. 

He chose the building at random 
and stepped into its sunken en- 
trance, intending to try the door. 
But before his fingers even touched 
the featureless surface, the door 
swung inward and concealed lights 
flicked on to reveal an empty foyer. 
Donant stepped across the threshold 
and the door closed behind him. 

The furniture was simple and — 
inevitably — of the same material 
as everything else in the city, on the 
whole planet for that matter. 
Against one wall a blue table stood 
on legs as slender as flower stems. 
There were blue chairs to match, 
and a small blue cloud of a couch. 

On the wall opposite the door 
was a vertical bank of buttons. 
Donant stepped forward and de- 
pressed the lowest one. The wall be- 
haved as he had thought it would: 
it split vertically, and the two halves 
receded. But instead of the elevator 
he had expected, he saw a long 
corridor lined at regular intervals 
with doors. 

He frowned. He was a logical 
man and he liked logical phenom- 
ena. So far nothing on the planet 
had made sense, and he knew he 
would never be able to leave till he 
forced it to make sense. As he stood 
there the two halves of the wall 
came back together in a seamless 
junction. 

Annoyed, Donant depressed the 
second lowest button. This time 
there was a pause before the wall 

31 



enacted its alternative role as a 
door — a pause and a sense of in- 
creased weight. Donant smiled then. 
It was he who had been illogical, 
not the builders. What he had mis- 
taken for a mere foyer was really 
a foyer-elevator. 

The second floor corridor was 
identical in all outward respects to 
the first. But Donant was a sys- 
tematic as well as a logical man, 
and a systematic investigation of 
the building virtually demanded 
that he begin on the ground floor. 
When the door became a wall again 
he depressed the lowest button and 
a moment later stepped out into 
the first floor corridor. 

He stood immobile for a moment, 
listening. There was no sound ex- 
cept the almost inaudible purring 
of invisible machinery. Behind him 
the foyer-elevator door once more 
blended into a wall. He started 
walking down the corridor. Light 
emanated softly from an indeter- 
minate source, seemed to be a 
part of the crystalline walls them- 
selves. 

He paused before the first door. 
It was featureless, just as the street 
door had been, hardly distinguish- 
able from the wall itself. He stood 
before it confidently, waiting for it 
to open. 

He stood there for some time* 
but nothing happened. Naturally 
not, Donant thought, irked with 
himself. The street door was in- 
discriminate, admitted anyone. This 
door was probably attuned to the 
ex-tenant’s personality or emotional 
pattern. This door didn’t know him 
from Adam. 

Donant drew his incandescer, 
32 


dialed it to maximum intensity and 
began to bum out a section large 
enough to permit his passage. The 
crystalline material had an incred- 
ibly high melting point, but it 
cowered before the blue-white 
wrath of the incandescer beam. 
Blue smoke coiled up, and auto- 
matic suction fans hummed into 
action and whisked it away. When 
the section of the door broke free 
and fell to the floor, the corridor 
walls saturated it with an acrid- 
smelling fluid. 

Donant edged through the open- 
ing into the room beyond. It was 
a large room, well ventilated and 
well furnished. Opposite the door a 
big oval window looked out into a 
courtyard. All of the chairs in the 
room were arranged so that they 
faced the window, but the chairs 
were empty, the room was empty, 
and the courtyard was empty. 

He approached the window more 
closely and peered out. The court- 
yard was a small one, surrounded by 
high featureless walls. Donant 
started. The walls, unlike every* 
thing else he had seen in the city, 
were not made of the crystalline 
substance. They were made of 
metal, a dull, gray, familiar metal. 

They were made of lead. 

Presently Donant lowered his 
eyes. The grass of the courtyard 
was a sickly green. There was a 
flower garden to the left, and the 
alien flowers drooped tiredly in the 
bright sunlight. Directly opposite 
the window there was a tree. 

Donant found himself staring at 
the tree. It was an alien tree, 
botanically remote from the elms 
and maples he had known on Eartl^ 

ROOM WITH VIEW 



but it wasn’t the alien quality that 
gave him pause, that filled him with 
foreboding. It was something else. 

The tree was dead. 

The other two rooms of the 
apartment were small and window- 
less. They contained padded oval 
platforms and were obviously sleep- 
ing quarters. There wasn’t a particle 
of dust in them — or a particle of 
life. 

Donant returned to the corridor. 

He experienced a sense of wrong- 
ness. After a moment he noticed 
that the section of the door he had 
burned out had disappeared, and 
then he noticed that the burned 
edges of the door itself, into which 
the section had fitted, had receded 
back to where the crystalline 
material was unaffected. 

As he watched, the material 
closed back in upon itself as though 
the orifice were a wound and the 
wound were healing. In a little 
while the door was whole again 
and all evidence of his vandalism 
had vanished. 

A self-healing building? A self- 
healing city? Then it must be a 
sentient city too. The crystalline 
material, despite its deceptive ap- 
pearance, bore no relationship to 
crystal. It was a complex alloy that 
the extinct race had developed, an 
alloy that possessed therapeutic 
qualities and an awareness of de- 
composition. 

And its awareness was not con- 
fined to its own decomposition. It 
included and acted upon everything 
detrimental to the cleanliness of the 
streets and structures which the 
metal comprised. For the first time 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 


Donant understood why there was 
no dust or corrosion in a city that 
had probably been dead for years, 
if not centuries. And he guessed why 
there were no bodies, no bones. 

A most meticulous metal. Not 
only did it clean up after itself, it 
cleaned up after its creators as 
well. 

Donant burned a section out of 
the next door and stepped into the 
next apartment. It was a duplicate 
of the first — three rooms, the furni- 
ture in the largest room grouped 
with the oval window as the central 
motif, and the window framing a 
view of walls, grass, flowers, and 
tree — 

Donant found himself staring at 
the tree again. It was unquestion- 
ably the same tree, its twisted trunk 
and leafless branches the same bone 
white in the glaring sunlight. And 
yet it stood just outside the window, 
exactly in front of the window, and 
that was manifestly impossible be- 
cause it stood exactly in front of the 
window of the room he had just 
left. 

After a moment he dropped his 
eyes to the lawn. It was a wretched 
lawn by any standards. In some 
places it had faded to a bleached 
yellow, in others it had died out al- 
together. Even in the few places 
where it still contained a semblance 
of life, it was singularly unim- 
pressive. The individual blades of 
grass were asymmetrical, thick on 
one side, dwindling to a sharp edge 
on the other, tapering upward to a 
lopsided point — 

Suddenly Donant found himself 
thinking of the statue he had seen 
in the council chamber — the statue 

33 



and the scales, and the objects the 
scales contained. A crystalline cube 
and a green knife — 

Or a building brick and a blade 
of grass? 

Abruptly another incongruity 
about the courtyard caught his eye. 
When he had entered the apart- 
ment building the sun had long 
since passed its meridian. That be- 
ing so, part of the courtyard should 
have been in shadow, but the only 
shadows on the dying lawn were 
the shadows cast by the branches 
of the dead tree, and they lay di- 
rectly beneath the branches them- 
selves . 

Donant left the room, walked 
down the corridor, took the foyer- 
elevator to the sixth floor and 
burned down the first door he came 
to. There was another living room 
and another oval window, and be- 
yond the window, on the same level 
as the floor, were the tree, the lawn, 
and the flowers. Donant was not 
surprised. He walked over to the 
window and put his foot through 
it. The huge tube popped and 
showered in white dust to the floor, 
and the crystal-like alloy devoured 
the dust the way it devoured all 
dust, all dirt, all flesh that had 
ceased to live. The tree and the 
lawn and the flowers became a med- 
ley of wires and tubes and resistors, 
and Donant knew why the city was 
dead. 


ONANT LIFTED the ship to 
ten thousand feet and threw it 
into glide. He turned up the scan- 
ner to a radius of five thousand 
miles and attuned it to the charac- 


teristics of the place he wanted to 
find. Buildings and streets and 
streets and buildings flowed forever 
beneath him ; oceans and cause- 
ways, and automatic factories that 
once had processed the food that 
had been drained from the seas. He 
flew west, keeping pace with the 
sun, and the fading afternoon 
traveled with him. 

Two subjective hours passed be- 
fore the scanner gave the sharp 
buzz he was waiting for. Darkness 
began to creep in from the twilight 
belt as he arrowed the ship down 
to the dot of greenness shining like 
a verdant star in the scintillating 
wastes of the city. 

The ship was small, and he 
brought it down on the moribund 
lawn. He got out and walked over 
to the dead tree. The tree was a 
pitiful thing in the lengthening 
shadows — a desiccated corpse, an 
unburied cadaver. Donant stood be- 
neath it, thinking of the race that 
had killed it — and thereby killed 
themselves. 

They had had to make a decision, 
and the statue in the council cham- 
ber symbolized that decision. The} 
had weighed nature against cities 
and they had found nature wanting 
in the balance; and their decision 
had been irrevocable because if the 
ultimate building material they had 
created destroyed all dirt, all de- 
cayed matter — it destroyed topsoil 
too . 

Why, then, hadn’t they chosen a 
different metal? Donant thought he 
knew the answer. Aside from the 
fact that the new alloy had prom- 
ised them an architectural utopia, 
there had been another considera- 



34 


ROOM WITH VIEW 



tion: over-population. No matter 
what building material they had 
chosen, the end result would have 
been the same: a planetary city. 
The only alternative would have 
been birth control, and birth con- 
trol, Donant knew, was contrary to 
the survival urge of any race of 
people. 

The dead race had overlooked 
the essential truth that, while ma- 
chines could take over the function 
of physical photosynthesis, they 
could not take over the function of 
spiritual photosynthesis; that a 
man cannot live solely for the sake 
of his own creations, and that he 
had to have other creations to in- 
spire him, to reanimate his will to 
go on living; natural creations 
above and beyond his ability to 
duplicate. 

The beauty of the council build- 
ing — and the beauty of the city as 
a whole — was tinselly because it was 
the product of creators without a 
criterion, creators who were crea- 
tively impotent. And, Donant knew, 
it was only a short step from crea- 
tive impotence to sexual impotence. 

Sunoikismos, he thought. Carried 
to extremes, it resulted in tragedy 
which the ancient Greeks had never 
dreamed of. For if it was true that 
man could not live entirely alone, 
neither could he live entirely with 
his fellow men. 

He could usurp his green lands 
with his cities, and he could find 
sustenance for his belly in his seas. 


He could create a complex society 
and learn to live in harmony with 
his neighbors. And as long as he 
did not completely lose contact 
with the death-to-life cycle of the 
earth he could find the strength 
and the inspiration to go on liv- 
ing, reproducing, laughing, loving, 
creating. But when he covered up 
and killed the last but one area 
of green land and in desperation 
televised that area to his tens of bil- 
lions of sterile cubicles, he was very 
close to death. 

Donant touched the trunk of the 
tree. His fingers sank deep into the 
dead tissue. The grass around his 
feet was gray and lifeless in the 
shadows. 

He walked slowly towards the 
ship. A three dimension televisor 
camera stood on spidery legs on the 
fringe of the lawn. Its glass eye 
stared at him solemnly as he passed, 
its lens glinting forlornly in the last 
rays of the lonely sun. Beyond the 
high lead walls, that had failed to 
perform their function, the crys- 
talline edifices stood, tall and mute 
and empty. 

Donant lifted the ship. The dot 
of dying grass and dead tree faded 
into the building shadows. The 
buildings coalesced, became a 
meaningless mass. When he left 
the atmosphere Donant set his co- 
ordinates so that the ship would 
emerge amid green worlds. Then 
he hit the transphotic —

BY FOX HOLDEN 


ROM SOMEWHERE there 
was a buzzing sound. It kept 
repeating. The gentle throb of it 
vibrated his eardrums; the vibra- 
tions registered somewhere at the 
bottom edges of his brain. Buzzzz. 
Insistently, like a wasp. Like a 
trapped wasp . • . But there were no 
wasps in the streamlined metal shell 
of Vanguard-I. 

Better answer another part of his 
brain whispered. Better answer . 
they want to tell you what to do . 

God! 

Some sweat oozed from the dark 
bunches of his eyebrows, fogged the 
binocular eye-piece of the orbit- 
synchronized refractor, but he kept 
watching, he could not stop watch- 
ing. Buzzz ! Buzzzz! 

Red gouts of flame, as big as a 
pin-head, as big as a shirt-button, 
as big as — damn the fogging-up! 
No, no it was the mushrooms, not 
the fogging; you could count them, 
like puffs of gunsmoke along a 
firing-line stippling the Atlantic 
seaboard, now branching, riddling 
westward — others drifting eastward 
from the Pacific as though groping 
toward a pre-planned rendezvous. 

Buzzzz! Buzzzz! 

He would answer. There would 
be the sound of another man’s 
voice and that would make it all 
real. If he silenced the buzzer and 
listened to the voice it would be 
real and not a final training-film; 
the films would be over, the lectures 
over, the flight-tests over, the elimi- 
nations over and he and Streeter 
chosen and Streeter dead and 
buried at Space and now he was 
alone up in Vanguard-I . 

Vanguard-I was “up” and Earth

was “down 55 and both were real. 
Beyond the buzzing, both would be 
real. 

The strong young voice was an 
old voice as it answered the buzzing, 
as it gave sound to words for the 
UHF’s panel-mike. 

“Home Plate, Home Plate, this 
is Mrs. Grundy, over . 

“Mrs. Grundy this is Home Plate. 
Are you reading? Are you ready for 
a circus or is all your money gone?

General Knight himself. Knight

Of course it was that bad! 

“Mrs. Grundy can you read, 
over . .” Knight’s voice. It sound- 
ed calm. It sounded unruffled. You 
had to know Knight, you had to 
have heard him often to know that 
it was not calm, that it was not at 
all unruffled . 

“Even the small print Daddy-o,

“No words twice so baby make

not taken completely off balance; 
retaliation now in progress as you 
have probably already observed or 
will observe in course of orbital 
passage. Plan Able Zebra effective 
immediately . .” The words were 
coming so fast they were slurred, 
and Knight was exaggerating his 
own Alabama accent. '‘Expect re- 
port once each turn . .” 

He would not have needed the 
recording or even words twice. 
Each of Knight’s directions was 
graven into him as it was spoken. 

To cease all scientific observation 

. r 

and recording at once; to begin 
military observation of the Enemy 
and his puppet-states, and all pos- 
sibly-discernible activities, immedi- 
ately. To remember that as the 
coast of California appeared on his 
horizon he was to begin transmit- 
ting in code, and that he would 
finish transmitting before the At- 
lantic coast disappeared over the 
horizon behind him. To remember 
that his stores of fuel were for orbit- 
correction only, to be used for ef- 
fecting an Earthside landing only 
upon explicit and properly-coded 
order, or upon threat of otherwise 
unavoidable destruction. To calcu- 
late present stores of food concen- 
trate and air to the hour if possible, 
not forgetting that with Streeter 
gone the time-lapse between ren- 
dezvous with the supply rocket 
should be at least doubled. To re- 
member a thousand things; things 
he already knew by rote . but 
the tape and card-punch units 
clicked softly away, recording, re-

cording . 

“. and Mrs. Grundy here’s a 
morsel for you — you may have a 
new neighbor in your block but not 
like you at all — there’s probably a 
world between you — don’t take any 
wooden nickels baby. Say good-bye 
to Daddy-o baby, over . .” 

“Home Plate this is Mrs. Grundy 
sees all and heard everything, out.” 
The whole transmission had tak- 
en less than two minutes. Now 
the UHF was off and there was 
one break, anyway. If, somehow, 
the Enemy had succeeded in get- 
ting up a satellite of his own, he 
had at least — according to Knight 
— sacrificed the ability to directly 
monitor Thorn’s radio for invisibil- 
ity. Vanguard-I was aloft for geo- 
physical purposes only, according 
to the propaganda-pitch back 
home. But as far as Big Red knew, 
it was loaded to the locks with as 
much armament as a thing of its 
comparatively tiny size could carry. 

And as far as Thorn himself 
knew, nobody making geophysical 
observations had ever needed to do 
it through the tubes of missile- 
launchers like the ones that were 
cuddled snugly in Vanguard-I’s 
blunt forehull . 

Such little thoughts whipped 
quickly through his mind as he 
tried to make it regain balance for 
the immediate tasks besetting him, 
because they were little and simple 
and easy to grasp and discard. 
They could keep him from going 
crazy. It was the bigger thoughts — 
the bigger ones that might come 
later — they were the kind he had 
to keep out of his head. 

Major Joshua Thorn began his 

DEAREST ENEMY 



work with the equipment, to modi- 
fy it for use as Daddy-o had told 
him. 

He could do it automatically, do 
it in his sleep, do it blind. Couldn’t 
watch and do it, though. Watch 
later. Think of the little things 
now that were easy while the equip- 
ment got automatically modified. 
Little things to keep the big ones 
like what was happening down 
there from tipping him over into 
the whirlpool of madness that was 
trying so hard to pull at him.

LEASE BE seated, Major 
JT Thom.” 

“Yes sir.” 

“This will be your Final Security 
interrogation. To be followed, upon 
its favorable completion, by Final 
Briefing. Before we begin, do you 
have any questions, Major?” 

The thick lenses of the glasses re- 
flected the interrogation cubicle’s 
harsh lighting and would not let 
him see accurately into the pale 
eyes that blinked behind them. But 
it was almost as though he and 
Brigadier Robert McQuine, USAF, 
Intelligence, were old friends. And 
the sweating faces of the three G-2 
psychiatrists that gleamed at Mc- 
Quine’s left on the opposite end of 
the big oval-shaped conference- 
table — they were more than fa- 
miliar. They had never thought he, 
Thom, was really sane. What real- 
ly sane man who had flown twice 
too many missions in one war would 
volunteer to fly in the next that 
followed? What sane man would go 
begging for military flight-test as- 

FOX HOLDEN 


signments in weird ships that had 
never been flown anywhere but in 
a wind-tunnel and on computer- 
tapes. And what sane man — God 
help him — what man in his senses 
would ask to be fired a thousand 
miles off the Earth with only the 
knowledge that a thing the size of 
a basketball had circled the planet 
successfully for almost a year be- 
fore it fell back and burned up? 

Had the Major ever had thoughts 
of — well, of doing away with him- 
self? Had the Major hated his 
father when he was young? Been 
afraid of girls? (Oh, is that a fact, 
Major? Well! Well, now . .) 

Only the faces of the three Sen- 
ate Committee members were dif- 
ferent. But they usually were. 

“Yes sir, one question. It was 
my understanding — and Captain 
Streeter’s, I’m sure — that Final Se- 
curity and Briefing had been 
scheduled for about nine weeks 
from now. There has been no ac- 
celeration in the final phases of our 
program, so — ” 

“I, ah — ” McQuine interrupted 
smoothly “think that question 
might best be answered by your 
Final Briefing officers, Major. Now, 
any other questions?” 

“No sir.” So that was it, all 
right. The rumors, as usual, had a 
germ of truth in diem. All rumors 
did. And these had been more per- 
sistent than most. Cold war not so 
cold anymore . General Adams 
transferring . That last note from 
Big Red — didn’t all get to the pa- 
pers! Cold war not so cold any- 
more . 

“Now, Major, when you were a 
sophomore in high-school— the 

55 



book entitled 4 Wwld United was 
not on your required English or 
Political Science reading lists, was 
it?” 

“No sir, not as I recall, but—” 
“Then why did you read it? You 
have admitted before that you did 
read it — ” 

Pause. All up to him. Every 
single word, every single inflection, 
up to him . 

“I took quite an interest in my 
studies, both in high-school and in 
college, sir, as I believe my records 
will show you. They’ll show that I 
also read books relating to other 
courses that weren’t a regular part 
of the curriculum . .” 

Nodding. But looking him 
squarely in the face, hesitating just 
the right length of time. Then sud- 
denly “Major Thorn do you swear 
here and now in the presence of 
witnesses that your allegiance to 
your country comes first above all 
with the sole possible exception of 
Almighty God?” 

“I do so swear . .” 

And on and on . 

“. why did you major in the 
Fine Arts in high-school, switch to 
Engineering in college, then switch 
again to take your degrees in World 
History and Political Science .

you told us that . training for 
five years* now, and you realize . 

More and more and more, but it 
was not so difficult to keep his 
nerves straightened out as it had 
been the first time or the next time 
after that. He had told the absolute 
truth as far as he could possibly 
know it. So it was just a matter of 
giving the same answers he had al- 
ways given. Let ’em make what 
they could of the truth . 

“Yes, Senator, I readily admit 
having written my senior essay on 
the basis of the book A World 
United . Yes sir, I studied philoso- 
phy and some foreign languages in 
college . No sir — no sir, nothing 
like that. No. Never . 

And then hardly an hour after it 
was all over, less than an hour to 
relax for Streeter and himself, 
cooped up in a single room with 
cigarettes and magazines and noth- 
ing else and nobody else to talk to, 
hardly an hour, and then Final 
Briefing was underway. 

General Groton: Typical Orders 
of Procedure. 

General Simms: Technical De- 
tails. 

General Orton: Estimate of the 
Present Situation. Rumors , hell . 

And then the Secretary of De- 
fense himself. 

“Major Thorn, Captain Street- 
er . There is probably little I 
can add to all that has been so 
thoroughly ingrained in you in 
your five years of training for this 
experiment, or learned by both of 
you, the hard way, in war. But 
there are certain points I feel I 
ought to emphasize personally . 
even though I know you’ve heard 

DEAREST ENEMY 



them many, many times before. 

“First, this is your country. In 
the adventure — in the duty, that 
you are about to undertake, there 
must be no mistake that your na- 
tion comes above all other con- 
siderations! Now, I don’t question 
your devotion, I merely re-im- 
press . 

Pause. The man was good, all 
right. 

“Second, despite what you may 
have heard from — from any of vari- 
ous sources in recent months, our 
cold-war Enemy is hard-pressed; he 
is desperate, and he is likewise de- 
termined. Determined as even you 
may not guess. Our Intelligence has 
learned that he has trained women 
to bear arms as well as children for 
his armies. He has trained them to 
march, to bivouac, to fly intercon- 
tinental bombers, to fly rocket in- 
terceptors, to go to the attack with 
men — and on an equal basis, and 
in almost equal numbers. A point 
to remember, even from where you 
shall soon sit! Don’t forget it. 

“Last, if — and we all pray that 
it won’t happen in this or any other 
generation — but, if war should 
come — if some unsuspecting mid- 
night it should suddenly erupt (and 
such eruption would be on both 
our shores, smashing all of our 
greatest cities even as we retali- 
ated) if this happens, gendemen, 
you must not forget one thing. You 
must not forget for an instant that 
in such a war, all the Enemy must 
die. 

“If I sound melodramatic for- 
give me, and bear with me. You 
both realize, I’m certain, that any 
Next War would be a war to the 


death. After which — ” the skill- 
fully-modulated voice lowered, 
softened, paused, softened again . 
“After which, there will be only 
one of us left. Because there will be 
no time for armistice, for truce . 
It will be Our Side, or Theirs. 
Gendemen, it must be Ours ! So if 
there is war, I repeat, all the Enemy 
must die! 

“That’s all I have, except to say 
good luck and God-speed.” 

Very firm hand-shake for each 
of them, and Final Briefing was 
over. 

Even yet Joshua Thom could re- 
member that first emotion shared 
by himself and Streeter after the 
effects of the four-G blast-off had 
worn away, after the tension of es- 
tablishing orbit was eased, the first 
report made to Home Plate, and 
they were at last granted a mo- 
ment’s rest, a moment’s respite to 
look back, to realize ... 

Done it. Done it . They had 
done it! 

They could almost see them- 
selves, the National Emblem em- 
blazoned brilliantly on their chalk- 
white metal skin, riding in digni- 
fied, silent triumph over all of the 
Earth. Now let anybody — anybody, 
anybody anywhere (for weren’t 
they above all of anywhere?) shake 
a fist, rattle a sabre! 

First Men in Space. Like God, 
somehow . 

They thudded each other on the 
back, they yelled things they could 
not remember, they let the tears 
flood down their cheeks without no- 
ticing, and they laughed ; they 
laughed long and loudly with words

and wordlessly, and tjien they 
watched again, watched mighty 
Earth below them turning by some 
power that was not theirs to see on 
an invisible spit over Infinity. 

It was at the end of the fourth 
month that Streeter died. 

“Josh? Josh what’s our trouble?” 
Young, earnest. Wiry and pink- 
cheeked and an eternal glint of ex- 
citement in his light blue eyes. 

Thorn kept studying the instru- 
ments as he answered, slowly, and 
without alarm in his voice. It 
wasn’t much, but the bunching of 
his thick eyebrows had given him 
away. It always did. 

“Port reflector’s all, I guess, 
Johnny. Been watching it; a hair 
off, so we’re down just enough 
BTU’s to make a dent in power 
supply. Must have come out a lit- 
tle cockeyed when we popped it. 
Want to watch the panel a few 
minutes while I — ” 

“Second-guessed you, Skipper — ” 
Johnny Streeter was already half- 
way into a pressure-suit. “Just zip 
me up the back and check my pet- 
ticoat . .” 

Josh Thorn grinned, closed 
Johnny’s suit, secured his soap- 
bubble helmet. They’d both been 
Out before so it wasn’t as if this was 
the first time. It was just that this 
was the first time it had to be done. 

“Suit-check, Johnny . .” 

“I read you — ” crackled the 
bulkhead audio. 

“Air?” 

“Fourteen point seven psi, oxy- 
gen 26 per cent, nitrogen . 

They finished the check; all the 
complex machinery of Baggy- 
Drawers was functioning perfectly. 

58 


Then Instrument Check — Meth- 
odically, Johnny’s gauntleted mitts 
touched each magnetic hook on the 
wide girdle, named each implement 
suspended from it, replaced it. 

“Can I go out and play now?” 

“Be a good boy, Johnny.” 

The lock hissed, cycled down, 
and then Thorn was hearing the 
metallic noises of Johnny’s feet 
striding ponderously like some 
story-book Colossus along the 
“upper” hull, sternward, and then 
to port. 

“Be a cinch, Josh,” the audio 
crackled. “If they’re all this easy 
I’ll feel like a draft-dodger! Maybe 
if I swab the deck while I’m ou — ” 
A sound that wasn’t Johnny but it 
was. 

“Johnny? Johnny, do you read 
me?” Josh Thorn could feel 
sweat dripping on his stomach. 
“Johnny—” 

He left the mike, made his way 
aft in clumsy haste, the simulated 
gravity confusing long-conditioned 
reflexes. And he listened beneath 
the hull section over which Johnny 
would be. Listened for a thump, a 
scrape of metal on metal, a vibra- 
tion of life . 

Nothing. 

His own Baggy-Drawers seemed 
built for a midget with one leg as 
he struggled into it. Cursory check 
— enough, she worked, she’d have 
to ... 

Out. Aft. Port. Johnny . 

Johnny Streeter was still stand- 
ing, but it was an odd kind of 
stance; the stance of a marionette 
on slack strings. Motionless. Stand- 
ing by the reflector mast, some of 
his magnetized instruments cling- 

DEAREST ENEMY 



ing to it. 

And then he saw Johnny Street- 
er’s helmet, and saw that it was no 
longer transparent. Josh tasted 
vomit on his lips. 

A chance in how many million, 
how many billion? What was it the 
statisticians had said? About the 
same chance as a fatal auto acci- 
dent, having a meteor hit you . 

E quipment converted, 

recalibrated for Earthside ob- 
servation. Equipment checked. 
Emergency reflectors out (power 
drain still damned heavy) and 
radar full out; close-down scanners 
on, recording equipment humming, 
ready . Coast coming up in — oh- 
nine minutes, three-seven seconds. 
Tapes ready at play-back, UHF set. 
Now wait. 

You can watch while you wait . 
His eyes hurt, their sockets hurt 
as he pressed them too hard into 
the binocular eye-piece. 

Damn the fogging! Damn the 
blue fogging — blue? 

No 

It filled the object-lens; it 
swirled, it calmed, it coalesced, it 
thinned, and there was a second’s 
sight through it, and then Josh 
Thom was swinging the refractor 
in near-abandon on its panhead . 
there! Clear! Clear, you could see 
— at the edges! Coming in again, 
drifting, drifting slowly, drifting 
. blind. 

His fingertips slipped, grabbed 
again, swung the telescope too vio- 
lently, steadied. 

Blue fog, moving slowly, deliber- 
ately, and yet so fast, so unbeliev- 

FOX HOLDEN 


ably fast, why, they said it if it ever 
happened it would take weeks, 
months, maybe years, but they 
could’ve been wrong, so many 
things they couldn’t have 
known . 

Blue. 

Cobalt blue. 

With some force of sheer power 
of reason, Joshua Thorn forced 
himself from the refractor; forced 
himself past the blue-faced scan- 
ners (maybe it was only an Enemy 
trick; an Enemy screen, the biggest 
blue smoke-screen ever made!) to 
the UHF. Maybe. Sure. He was 
overdue. Minutes overdue; they 
were waiting for him down there, 
waiting for his call, wondering if 
perhaps the screen had really fooled 
him, or if it were really effective in 
blocking his sight, or if . 

They were right down there, 
right underneath him, waiting un- 
der the blue smoke-screen. 

“Home Plate Home Plate this is 
Mrs. Grundy over . .” 

Crackling. 

“Home Plate Home Plate this is 
Mrs. Grundy. Home Plate Home 
Plate what’s the matter can’t you 
read? Home Plate Home Plate this 
is Mrs. Grundy, over . Over ! 39 

Crackling. 

The meters . All right — on the 
nose, right. What were they, asleep 
down there? Maybe the smoke- 
screen reflected even UHF. He 
could try a bounce and see. Narrow 
beam. Tight. Watch the screen . 

Pip. Pip. Pip. 

Getting through. Lousy smoke, 
just couldn’t see through it . 

“Home Plate Home Plate Home 
Plate — ” 

59 



He had beep around fifty times; 
he had counted. It had taken one 
hundred hours ; he had counted.. He 
had transmitted steadily since the 
twentieth time, in the few lan- 
guages he knew beside his own, for 
sixty hours; he had counted. 

He had only a whisper for a 
voice now, and only aching places 
where his ears were. 

But it didn’t matter. It didn’t 
matter. 

“Home Plate, this is Mrs. 
Grundy — 

“Can anyone read me? Does 
anyone read me down there? 

“ Kann jedermann. mich horen? 
Aniworten-Sie , bitte . 

“ Repondez , repondez si vous 
mfentendrez . 

“Damn you can’t you hear me 
CAN’T YOU HEAR ME?” 

He’d tried to keep track of the 
time. 

He thought it had been a month; 
maybe more, but a month anyway. 

And now the blue was solid over 
Earth, over all of it. There were 
still little swirls, little eddies of it 
here and there, but most of it — 
already, most of it had settled like 
a fixed shell, like the quiescent sutt 
face of a stagnant pool. 

And somehow he’d accepted it. 

They were all dead down there. 

Cobalt blue had killed them all, 
killed them all . 

Funny. It had a rhythm to it. 
Cobalt blue had killed them all, 
killed them all, Cobalt bombs had 
killed them all — 

STOP IT! 

But if they were all dead . 

And if he were not dead . 


Then he was the last human be- 
ing left alive. 

That was crazy. 

Nobody could be — nobody could 
be the last — 

But there was nobody. 

Except him. So, it followed: 
therefore — ergo: logically, if there 
was nobody, and if . 

God it was dark. 

God, it was quiet. 

And if . 

If you laugh you’ll go crazy. 

If you don’t laugh, if you don’t 
laugh, if you — hell, only one dose 
of barbiturate left in the First Aid 
stores . big thing, hard to swal- 
low . and if there’s nobody left, 
then . 

Sleep. 

He hadn’t touched the UHF in 
three months, but he’d left it on 
regardless of the power drain just 
in case. 

He had divided the hours off into 
sleeping and eating periods, and he 
had just slept, and just eaten, and 
he’d shaved, and put on a fresh 
uniform. He had knotted the tie 
perfectly; his collar insignia were 
shined and pinned in place without 
a single wrinkle. 

He had it figured out. 

He could die of oxygen, if not 
food, starvation in five more 
months, three and one-half more 
days. And that would be the end 
of it. 

The hell it would! Who the hell 
did they think they were to do this 
to him . 

But he had his computers. He 
had his reference-tapes. He had 
his refractor and his scanners, and 

DEAREST ENEMY 


60 



his s<4r-charts> and his store of fuel 
for orbital correction (ninety per- 
cent of which remained, because it 
had beep an almost perfect shot) 
and he had his brains. 

If you threw a stone off the rear 
of a moving train at a speed less 
than the train’s speed forward, the 
stone would of course leave the 
train, but in relation to the ground 
would still be travelling in the 
train’s direction. 

If you threw a satellite away from 
its path around Earth and directly 
into Earth’s wake, but at a speed 
less than Earth’s forward speed in 
its orbit, the satellite would break 
free, but would continue in Earth’s 
orbital direction. And then with a 
brief side-blast, you could warp 
into an orbit around the Sun all 
your own, or — into that of the 
planet Venus, if you chose . 

And beneath that eternal shell of 
cloud — who knew? 

He had his computers. He had 
his reference-tapes. He had his re- 
fractor and his scanners, and his 
star-charts and his precious store of 
fuel. (Three-score years and ten, 
the Good Book said. Better than 
five months. Better than sitting 
and waiting. So he would fail — no 
worse than what was Below.) And 
he had his brains. 

He worked methodically. He 
drew schedules : four hours of work, 
one for eating and relaxation; five 
hours more of work, and another 
for food and rest; six hours more 
of work, then seven for sleep, and 
then the cycle began again. By mak- 
ing a rhythm of it, he thought, 
rather than a program of perfectly 

FOX HOLDEN 


equal work-periods, he would avoid 
monotony. With monotony would 
come despair, and with despair . 
Despair of course would kill him. 

And there was the thing in him 
that would not be killed; a thing 
that had been rooted as deep within 
his kind as Life itself, since the first 
Man had shambled erect on the 
face of the still-steaming Earth. He 
would survive. 

As Joshua Thom, and as Man. 
He would not let Man die yet. Not 
out here. Not in the cold dark* 
alone. Somehow, Thorn thought, 
Man had earned a better way, a 
better place to die . 

But of course it was silly to think 
that Man should ever die, that be 
could ever die . 

Ridiculous. 

Baloney. Oh, you could kill a lot 
of people, certainly. Sure. But the 
whole race of Man — nuts to the 
philosophers! The only thing they 
knew how to do was think l 

He worked methodically, ascer- 
taining first that at the present 
point in her orbital swing, Venu % 
approaching as she was from 
aphelion, would be in close enough 
proximity as she passed by to be 
met within the time limit set by his 
remaining store of food and oxygen. 
And he ascertained secondly that 
he had sufficient “emergency” fuel 
(and this, he assumed, might be 
classified as an emergency of sorts?) 
to blast him out of orbit and into 
Earth’s wake with barely sufficient 
speed to assure him of not falling 
back. If the computers weren’t 
lying, there’d even be enough after 
that to warp him into the gradual, 
drifting arc that would intercept 

61 



Venus in her path around the Sun, 
and then — perhaps enough to effect 
landing. Barely, if at all. His taut 
mouth twitched in a humorless little 
smile. What an irony to actually 
succeed — to make it all the way, 
across the millions of miles of Space, 
first human in history to accomplish 
it — and then, maybe one or two 
hundred feet above surface, to have 
the final drop of fuel run out . 

So . what was there to lose but 
the race of Man . And that any- 
way, eventually. Thirty-five more 
years (if he were lucky; he smiled 
again) appended to — how many? 
Half a million? 

But half a million years was only 
a nervous twitch on the skin of 
Time. A spark in an eternal, all- 
consuming fire; a spark that died 
even as it flared its little second 
and then crumbled into ashes. 


H E SMILED a grim little smile, 
and made a note of the date; 
it was 1800 hom*s, October 21. He 
did not even glance at the pale-blue 
thing that rolled and shimmered 
grotesquely a scant thousand miles 
on his left. Be damned to you! But 
you are damned already. So good- 
bye. 

His fingers finished the business 
of tightening the heavy buckle of 
his seat-belt, and then the punched 
the red firing-studs, and Van- 
guard-I broke her bondage. 

The ferroelectric brains of the 
computers considered silently; 
acted. 

The organic brain of the man 
hazed red, hazed darkly, and 
trusted, for it was powerless to do 


more save fight a primal struggle 
for consciousness. It could not re- 
gard the situation. It could not 
think: I am the first human being 
to fly Space. It could not think, of 
all the things that all the humans in 
all of history have ever done, I 
alone have done this.

The screens showed white, thick 
white, and the fuel-pumps dis- 
gorged the remainder of Vanguard 
Vs life-blood into the roaring com- 
bustion chambers. The muted com- 
plaining of heavy atmosphere 
keened up the scale to a banshee’s 
lament and sweat poured from Josh 
Thom’s half-nude body as his tiny 
metal cell grew stifling.

DEAREST ENEMY 



One hundred miles. 

Fifty. Thirty. Twelve . 

Cooler, now. He shivered in 105 
degrees Fahrenheit, shivered in 99, 
in 87 . His sweat was cold. 

Ten thousand feet! Slowing, 
slowing, a century of time to drop 
to nine thousand, ease off the 
power, eight thousand, steady; fuel, 
barely, six thousand, steady, 

. Steady 

Watch your screens! Green. 
Brown, yellow, blue-veined green; 
low-rolling magenta mountains 
westward, cloud-shadows rippling, 
mingling with tenuous wisps of 
steam . steam from the jungles 
of tall forest ... 

One thousand feet. No sign of 
mobile life on this planet, in this 
valley into which Vanguard- 1 low- 
ered. But all sign — all sign, indeed, 
of the rich lushness that would 
support it, embrace it, hold it close 
like a long-denied lover . 

Thorn sweated again — hot sweat, 
now — at his scanners, his control 
panel. Temperature again hovering 
past 100, but there was no time to 
notice or to feel. One hundred feet 
. gently . 

And then Vanguard-I was down, 
and at rest. 

Josh Thom hesitated. Baggy- 
Drawers? Or not? Beneath the 
white, tenuous outer atmospheric 
shell of methane and ammonia, 
what? Air he could breathe? Or 
poison that would strangle him — 

He swung the inner air-lock 
open. 

If poison, then death would be 
but a matter of days ; the bubble of 
Made-in-U.S.A. atmosphere that 
he’d brought thirty million miles 

FOX HOLDEN 


across Space had supplied him for 
the nearly four months the Journey 
had taken. It had done its job, he 
could demand no more than that. 
Two weeks more, at best, and it 
would tye spent forever. 

Two weeks, thirty-five years, five 
thousand centuries — 

He swung the outer air-lock 
open. 

And breathed. And breathed. 
And breathed deeply again. 

Joshua Thorn wanted to cry. 
There was a hurt in his throat, and 
he wanted to yell, and he wanted to 
laugh great peals of laughter even 
as the unchecked salt tears streamed 
across the deep valleys of his cheeks. 

He walked, he ran. He stopped, 
he turned his face to the sky, he 
spread his arms wide and let the 
great bellows of laughter roll from 
his lips in the lusty prayer of thanks 
that only the living who are full 
with life and amid the teeming 
fullness of life can know. 

Thank you, God. Thank you 
God. Thank you . 

(For this little while more, for 
this little while more for the race 
of Man; I am the last of Man, You 
know — ) 

He prayed thank you, but he did 
not pray for more, because this was 
already more than he deserved ; the 
Almighty had been merciful, com- 
passionate and merciful, and he 
could not ask for more, in no way 
dared ask — 

The thunder seemed straight 
above him. 

The sound of his own laughter 
had drowned it out at first, and 
then the two had mingled, and then 
as he stood gasping for new breath, 

63 



as his hoarse voice rested, he heard 
it — welling as if from a great heavy 
throat, and now rising to a baleful 
cry, then falling — falling gently, 
and now a new thunder to drown 
it, a mightier thunder than the first* 
Joshua Thom stood transfixed as 
he watched the gleaming bullet- 
shape descend its pillar of fire. It 
could have been twin to Van- 
guard-I. It was descending — it was 
— maneuvering to be near him! 

From somewhere far back in his 
brain the words formed again, and 
Mrs. Grundy here’s dirt for you — 
you may have a new neighbor in 
your block but not like you at all — 
probably a world between you — 
don’t take any wooden nickels . 

But Daddy-o could never know, 
would never comprehend — 

He was running, stumbling, fall- 
ing, running again toward the spot 
where the red-starred satellite of 
the Enemy (Enemy, what a mad- 
man’s word now!) would land. 

Running like a child, running 
like an idiot, arms waving, mouth 
laughing, throat shouting — 

Thank you, oh Thank you 
God . • • 

He was within twenty yards of 
the craft when its outer lock opened. 
Fifteen when the uniformed figure 
who stepped out caught sight and 
sound of him, ten when the rifle 
was aimed at him, five before he 
could comprehend the mindless 
meaning of it — 


But we are the only two human 
beings left! his brain whimpered . 

All of the Enemy must die! a 
remembering part of his mind in- 
toned . But someone had trained 
the Enemy, too. 

The scarlet insigne emblazoned 
on the streamlined metal shell 
seemed on fire in the filtered 
Venusian sunlight. 

Thom’s plunging hands grabbed 
the muzzle of the weapon even as 
it fired, wrenched it aside without 
feeling the hurt where his left ear- 
lobe had been. 

“Great God, you imbecile — " 

Twisting the weapon, struggling, 
trigger-finger constricting to fire 
again, a final, sudden twist, the 
finger wrenched against the trigger 
even as the butt was swinging up- 
ward, the muzzle swinging down . 

The muffled explosion. 

The gaping, oozing hole in the 
Enemy’s breast. 

Joshua Thom looked down at 
the crumpled figure, watched as the 
slow-moving shadow of a cloud 
eddied across it. 

He tried to sob, for he could not 
pray again. 

He turned. Back toward Van- 
guard-I. If only he could cry. 

Behind him, the Enemy lay dead. 
All, now, all of the Enemy . was 
dead. 

Her body would soon be turning 
cold. • • •

T HE first terrestrial expedition 
to Mars didn’t find any Mar- 
tians. Neither did the second. Since 
there are so few Martians left, 
those facts are less surprising than 
that the third did. 

i . r For many years before space 

Everyone knows that Earth s flight was accomplished, there had 

been discussions and theories about 
how to communicate with Mar- 
tians, if any existed. But, of course, 
nobody was ready when the time

They fell back on that antiquated

not without some trepidation. Ex-

they had their orders, 
they probably would 
have shot first and 
asked questions later.

gineer into the micro-

They’ve got real long legs and 
arms, and big heads with big eyes 
and ears.” 

“Are they intelligent? Are they 
civilized? How do they breathe?” 

“Wait a minute, Captain,” pro- 
tested Von Frisch. “You’re going a 
little too fast, sir. They’ve just come 
up to us. I don’t know whether 
that’s fur on them or whether 
they’re wearing clothes.” 

“Well, try to communicate with 
them, man!” exclaimed Powers ex- 
citedly. 

Von Frisch did his best. The 
Martians appeared friendly enough, 
and interested. Von Frisch tried to 
communicate in the only method 
he had heard about. 

While his companions watched 
curiously, he shut his ears to the 
running fire of questions from Pow- 
ers, squatted and drew a right an- 
gled triangle in the red desert sand. 
By one of the sides he drew three 
marks, by another four. 

Then he stepped back and looked 
questioningly at the Martians. 

One of the Martians squatted in 
a tangle of pipestem arms and legs, 
and with a long finger drew five 
lines beside the triangle’s hypot- 
enuse. 

“They understand the Pythag- 
orean theorem, sir!” exclaimed 
Von Frisch. 

“Good! They undoubtedly know 
some astronomy, then. Go on.” 

Von Frisch hesitated a moment, 
then erased the triangle. He drew 
a small circle with rays from it, for 
the sun. He drew four larger con- 
centric circles around it, with small 


circles for planets on the rim of 
each one. 

He pointed to the third planet, 
then at himself, then at his com- 
panions, one by one. Then he 
pointed at the fourth planet and at 
the Martians, one by one. To com- 
plete the matter, he pointed at the 
sky. 

“We are Earthmen,” he said. 
“You are Martians.” 

The trouble was that the Earth- 
men didn’t realize the things the 
Martians had were weapons until 
they used them. They didn’t realize 
it then, as a matter of fact, be- 
cause the Earthmen were dead, all 
three of them. 

The Martian hunting party came 
back from the desert with word of 
the strange creatures who came , 
apparently , from another world . 

“Whether they have weapons , we 
do not know” said the leader of the 
hunting party. “But they wished to 
harm our people , so we killed them 
all” 

“ That is desperate action” said 
the patriarch of the village . “In 
what way were they dangerous to 
us?” 

“Foolishly they disclosed their in- 
tention to us” replied the leader of 
the hunting party. “They informed 
us they planned to take over our 
world and to drive our people far- 
ther from the sun, to the great 
planet Jupiter.” 

“Then you did right ,” said the 
patriarch, blinking his big eyes. 

Biggs and Golden were working 
near the G-boat. Their helmet ra- 
dios were set to a different channel 
from that used by the exploring

We all know that every android has its little idiosyncrasies. 

But what can a civilized human being do about it 


Illustrated by Paul Orban 

YOUR SERVANT, SIR 


when his perfect servant drives him crazy? 





T HE CHUBBY woman glared at 
the android and dropped her 
suitcase on the floor. She turned to 
her husband and said in an angry, 
unsteady voice, “I’m leaving. ,, Her 
double chin trembled. “I can’t 
stand the sight of that thing an- 
other second.” 

Raymond Golden gripped his 
empty glass with both hands, leaned 
forward tensely in the chair, and 
tried to find the right words. 

“Paula,” he began helplessly. 
“Please wait. I’ll get it fixed, or sell 
it, or trade it in. I’ll do something.” 
Mrs. Golden pointed a shaky, 
pudgy finger. “I’ll never come back 
as long as that is here.” 

She bent to pick up her suitcase. 
The android approached silently 
and stared at her posterior. 

“Madam,” the android said, 
“you are getting quite fat.” 

Paula’s back snapped upward. 
Her face was red and there were 
dark shadows under her eyes. “I 
can’t stand it!” she shrieked. “I 
can’t! I can’t!” 


BY SOL BOREN 


The words pierced Raymond’s 
skull, exploded and splattered with- 
in. He winced under the barrage. 
Paula ignored the automatic door 
button, and flung the plastic slab 
open with her hand. 

The android followed her with 
its cold stare and spoke in its per- 


fect voice. “Madam, that dress is 
atrocious. I would suggest that you 
change at once to your gray, prin- 
cess silk, which will, at least, create 
the impression of slenderness.” 
Paula screamed hysterically and 
ran out of the apartment. The 
android moved swiftly to the door 
and called after her, “Farewell, 
Madam. Watch your weight. Take 
care.” 

It pushed the button on the wall 
and the door swung shut. 

The dreaded ultimatum had at 
last been carried out, and Raymond 
felt helpless, numbed. Indecision 
settled upon him like a leaden cloak 
and pulled him back against the 
foam-air-rest, where his head wob- 
bled uncomfortably. He closed his 
burning, blood-shot eyes, and found 
no peace. He rubbed them with his 
free hand, and opened his vision to 
the staring android. 

Without any conscious thought, 
his arm extended in a slow, habitual 
motion. The android responded 
automatically, plucked the empty 
glass out of his hand, and said, 
“You drink too much, sir.” 
Raymond nodded irritably. “I 
know. You’ve reiterated that pro- 
found spiritual message with mo- 
notonous irregularity.” 

“But you do, you know.” 
Raymond shouted angrily, “Shut 
up!” 

“Very good, sir.” 

The android was a tall, hand- 
some model. Its voice was deep, 
resonant and faintly British. It 
glided over to the built-in bar and 
performed rapid, indiscernible 
manipulations involving ice cubes, 
whiskey and soda. 


69 



The android returned swiftly 
with the drink and served it with 
a sweeping flourish. Raymond took 
the glass and gestured impatiently. 
“Cigar.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

The android withdrew a long, 
brown cigar from the humidor on 
the small, floating ebony end-table, 
placed the clipped end in Ray- 
mond’s mouth, and lit it with the 
tip of its forefinger, which suddenly 
glowed red. 

It watched as Raymond puffed 
up several billowing, little gray 
clouds. The smoke drifted towards 
the android, and it said: “Disgust- 
ing habit.” 

Raymond raised his glass, sipped 
the cold liquid, and remarked bit- 
terly, “What a pity you can’t enjoy 
your own poisonous concoctions.” 

The android stepped back and 
stared fixedly at the man. “You are 
a sot, sir.” 

Raymond exploded. “What!” 

“S-o-t, sot. An alcoholic. A 
drunkard. One who imbibes intoxi- 
cating liquors.” 

Raymond jumped out of the 
chair and threw his glass and cigar 
on the carpet violently. The cigar 
sizzled in the midst of the foaming 
liquid. He glared at the android. 
“You go to hell!” 

“As I have repeatedly attempted 
to impress upon your happy, pickled 
brain, sir,” the android said, “It is 
impossible for me to go there.” 

“That isn’t exactly what I 
meant.” 

“In that case, sir, I would suggest 
that hereafter you say what you 
mean.” 

Raymond swore. He swayed un- 
70 


certainly, and then dropped back 
into the chair. He reached out to 
the floating table for a fresh cigar, 
jammed it in his mouth, and 
chewed it nervously. He was a 
short, chubby man, with brown, 
thinning hair, a double chin, and 
lines around his mouth; where a 
friendly smile had recently met an 
untimely death. 

Raymond pulled his cigar out of 
his mouth and stared at the wet 
soggy end. He moved his head from 
side to side, turned his gaze on the 
android, and muttered through his 
teeth, “You and your impeccable 
androidal exterior have got to go.” 
The decision immediately had a 
relaxing effect. Raymond’s moist 
brow unwrinkled itself momentar- 
ily, and he almost smiled at the 
thought. 

“Allow me to point out, sir,” the 
android said. “That you have, to 
date, invested approximately three 
thousand dollars in my interior and 
exterior, as well.” 

Raymond nodded sadly. “Not to 
mention fifteen more easy, cardio- 
vascular producing payments.” He 
placed his hand over the spot, 
where, deep down, his heart was 
located. Satisfied that it was still 
there, he said, “I’ve got a lot of 
expensive money tied up in you, but 
if I have to choose between mechan- 
ical misery and matrimonial bliss, 
I’ll settle for Paula’s brand of in- 
human torture.” 

“That, sir, is extremely faulty, 
illogical, and irrational reasoning. 
Typical, however, of most hu- 
mans.” 

Raymond smiled grimly and 
stood up. “If you will watch closely, 

YOUR SERVANT, SIR 



oh, loyal servant, you will note that 
I am about to do something not so 
typical of my assorted human 
friends. ,, 

Walking unsteadily over to the 
bar, he reached into a small drawer, 
and withdrew a small plastic con- 
tainer labeled: SOBERUPPER. 

“In fact,” Raymond said, as he 
removed two pills and tossed them 
into his mouth, “I must be out of 
my mind.” 

He swallowed hard, blinked, and 
gasped. For a moment he leaned 
heavily on the bar. Then suddenly, 
clarity. The room was brighter. The 
drab grays resolved into blue and 
yellow pastel panelling along the 
walls. The carpeting was a rich 
deep blue. The polished floating 
ebony slab glittered in the room. 

“Come on, Android. We’re 
heading for the big city.” 

The city, as they flew over it, 
was a blazing ocean of roof-top ad- 
vertisements, designed to attract the 
attention of the overhead traffic. 

Raymond threw a switch and a 
private radar beacon blipped 
brightly on his jetcopter’s screen. 
He touched a button and the con- 
trols automatically guided the craft 
towards a gigantic flashing sign, 
which proclaimed : GENERAL 

ANDROIDS. 

The jetcopter dropped onto the 
roof-top parking lot with a thud. 
The android and Raymond climbed 
out and took the nearest escalator 
down to the mezzanine. They en- 
tered the Sales Manager’s office, 
where Raymond cornered Mr. 
Krutchamer, the Assistant Sales 
Manager, and quickly explained the 

SOL BOREN 


difficulties with the android. 

Mr. Krutchamer was a smsdl 
wiry man with a surprisingly deep, 
impressive voice. He shrugged his 
slight shoulders, after listening pa- 
tiently, and said, “Doesn’t sound 
like a mechanical manifestation to 
me, sir.” 

“Mechanical or electronical,” 
Raymond demanded perplexed, 
“what’s the difference?” 

“Well, sir,” Mr. Krutchamer be- 
gan with a flashing white-toothed 
smile, “you’ve had your android 
for three months, and while our 
guarantee is for one year, it spe- 
cifically spells out an unconditional 
warranty against mechanical de- 
fects.” 

“No guarantee against any elec- 
tronic defects?” 

The little man shook his head 
emphatically. “No, sir. All electri- 
cal parts are guaranteed, of course, 
for thirty days, but you’ve had the 
android for ninety days.” 

Mr. Krutchamer’s face was sad, 
his eyebrows crept down over his 
eyes, and his voice dropped to a 
confidential decibel level. “I’m 
sorry, sir, but your problem sounds 
more like a chronic psycho-electron- 
ic condition. I would recommend 
that you see a PRD.” 

“What’s that?” Raymond was an- 
noyed. His face was flushed and he 
squinted at the little man. 

“Doctor of Psychiatric Ro- 
botory.” 

“This android doesn’t need 
Psycho-therapy, damn it,” Ray- 
mond said hotly. “Maybe some 
minor adjustment with a heavy 
monkey wrench. But that’s all.” 

“Perhaps.” The little man turned 

7 > 



on the smile. “The important thing 
in an android is that it function 
properly and efficiendy. We are pre- 
pared in every way to keep your 
android in perfect operating condi- 
tion, but we do not feel that it is 
at all necessary to concern ourselves 
with an android’s alleged thoughts 
or vocal expressions. After all, it is 
only an android. A machine. A 
clever machine, but a machine.” 

“This clever machine has driven 
my wife out of our home, and is 
edging me into a cybernetic psycho- 
neurosis.” 

Raymond walked stiffly out of the 
Sales Manager’s office on to the 
balcony that overlooked the various 
androids that were on display in 
the showroom below and stared at 
the section designated MANSERV- 
ANT. There was an astonishing 
variety of tall, short, slim, fat, 
young, middle-aged, and old look- 
ing androids. 

Mr. Krutchamer approached 
him slowly. Raymond fought back 
his annoyance and asked in despera- 
tion, “What kind of deal can you 
give me on a trade in?” 

The Assistant Sales Manager 
smiled and said thoughtfully, “Let 
me see.” He turned and examined 
the android. He looked it up and 
down, walked around in back of it, 
and looked it up and down some 
more. Then he circled it slowly 
three times, and concluded the 
ritual by making clucking noises 
with his teeth. 

Finally Mr. Krtuchamer said, 
“Can’t give you too much, you 
realize. It isn’t equipped with radar, 
or any navagational instruments, or 
even the built-in computer. About 


as high as I can go would he one 
thousand.” 

“One thousand!” exclaimed Ray- 
mond. “That would leave a balance 
of almost four thousand, plus the 
balance I’ve already got on this 
one.” 

The android stared at Raymond 
and said, “I could have told you 
that before you came down here, 
sir. 

Raymond jumped, and snapped 
at the android, “Shut up!” 

Raymond was furious. He turned 
suddenly on Mr. Krutchamer. 

The Assistant Sales Manager ran 
into his office and closed the door 
behind him. 

“Really, sir,” the android said, 
“your method of operating this 
flying machine is truly offensive.” 

Raymond jabbed the throttle 
and the jetcopter leaped forward. 
He sat tensely at the controls, beads 
of perspiration across his forehead. 

The android said, “I would sug- 
gest, sir, that you allow me to 
demonstrate the proper method of 
operating these controls.” 

The jetcopter lurched suddenly 
in a sharp turning motion, and 
angled in rapidly for a reckless, 
ground landing at WHEELER’S 
WONDERFUL USED AN- 
DROID LOT. 

Mr. Wheeler personally met Ray- 
mond and the android as they dis- 
embarked. “Greetings,” he said. 
“Looking for a good used android?” 

Raymond shook his head. “Got 
one I want to sell.” He pointed and 
asked, “How much?” 

Wheeler examined the android 
rapidly and said, “Looks like a good 

YOUR SERVANT, SIR 


72 



clean model. Guess I could give you 
about five hundred cash/' 

Raymond exclaimed, “What! 
That the best you can do?” 

Wheeler nodded and smiled. 
“That’s Blue Book on this model. 
Take it or leave it. That’s my top 
offer — cash.” 

Raymond turned away. “Come, 
my faithful manservant,” he said 
despondently. “Let us return to our 
dismal retreat, where I can get 
properly and thoroughly liquored 
up.” 

R AYMOND WAS tired and de- 
jected. His face was lined and 
despair was in his eyes. He collapsed 
into his favorite chair and dis- 
patched the android to the bar. 

Two highballs later an idea 
dashed itself to pieces in Raymond’s 
brain. He jumped up, ran over to 
the Televisor, and placed a call 
to Allied-News-Facs. When the 
News-Facs android’s plastic face 
appeared on the screen, Raymond 
said, “I want to place an ad in the 
For Sale or Swap section of the 
Four O’clock Edition.” 

“Yes, sir. What do you desire to 
say?” 

Raymond frowned. “Just say 
this: Anyone desiring to take over 
the payments of one darling, 
efficient, well-mannered, hand- 
some, unbearably conscientious an- 
droid can purchase the equity ex- 
tremely cheap at great sacrifice.” 
“Is that all?” 

“Yes, for now. If that doesn’t 
work, I’ll call you back.” He gave 
his address and televisor number 
and switched off. 


Raymond turned to his android 
and said, “I’ve reconsidered. Maybe 
psycho-electronic-therapy can really 
help— one of us/’ He glanced at his 
watch. It was eleven a. m. “Let’s 

go.” 

The android followed obediently 
and said, “This is extremely mono- 
tonous/* 

The door read : DR. FRED- 
RICK MILLHOP, PRD 

Inside, the waiting room was 
jammed with human beings and 
assorted electronic, two-legged con- 
trivances. Surprise halted Raymond 
half-way through the doorway, and 
he studied the crowd in disbelief. 

A beautiful female voice pierced 
the noisy confusion of human and 
unhuman voices: “Do you have an 
appointment, or are you human?” 
Raymond stared at the Recep- 
tionist-Android, with its fixed smile 
on its sculptured feminine face, 
and replied unhappily, “I had no 
idea I would need one.” 

The Receptionist-Android smiled 
steadily. “Is this an emergency, or 
a disaster, or are you sober?” 
“Could be,” Raymond replied, 
bewildered. “Yes.” 

“If you desire to wait, perhaps 
the Doctor might see you, see you, 
see you. But I don’t see why, see 
why, see why.” 

Mumbling a hasty assent, Ray- 
mond retreated into an unoccupied 
corner, where he and his android 
waited. The other men and women 
in the room were a grim, haggard 
looking group. As for the other 
androids, Raymond refused to look 
at them; and he closed his ears to 
all sound.

Noon came and passed, and the 
afternoon dragged. Raymond lost 
his feeling of impatience, and stood 
in the comer trance-like. Finally 
at two-thirty a tiny green light 
flashed in the Receptionist-An- 
droid’s metallic bosom. 

“The doctor will see you now or 
never.” 

The large, spacious office, with 
its glowing walls, dimmed ceiling, 
and deep, soft carpeting was a 
silent, soothing relief. Raymond’s 
android watched as the two men 
engaged in a mutually weary hand- 
shake. 

Dr. Millhop was a tall thin, sharp 
featured man. There were black 
moons under his eyes that lay 
heavily on long, guttered wrinkles. 
He leaned back in his chair, as 
Raymond explained the android’s 
manifestations. 

The Doctor nodded his head in 
the manner of a man who had been 
listening to the same story all day, 
day after day. 

“Mr. Golden,” Dr. Millhop said, 
“you must realize that every an- 
droid has its own peculiar idiosyn- 
crasies. Unfortunately, in some 
instances, there is absolutely noth- 
ing that can be done about it.” 

Raymond gestured at his android, 
and asked hopefully, “What about 
this instance?” 

“I don’t know,” the Doctor re- 
plied frankly. “Before I can express 
an opinion, it will be necessary to 
run your android through exhaus- 
tive tests and have my technical 
staff examine its electronic circuits 
minutely. If it is a simple matter 
of rewiring, or, say, a faulty com- 
ponent, why, of course, we can 

74 


straighten it out very easily. How- 
ever, if it is a condition that is 
caused by Unknown Factors, then 
I can prescribe only one thing.” 
He paused, spread his palms, and 
added sadly, “As so many of us 
seem to be attempting these days — 
don’t lose your temper ” 

“How long will it take to run 
your tests?” 

“We can send it into the lab im- 
mediately, run it through the ana- 
lyzers, and have a report in one 
hour.” 

Raymond reached into his coat 
pocket for a cigar, stuck it in his 
mouth and lighted it with an old- 
fashioned lighter. He puffed 
thoughtfully, took one glance at the 
android, and said, “Let’s do it.” 
The android’s head swiveled 
sharply, staring first at Raymond 
and then at the Doctor. “Isn’t any- 
one going to consult me?” 

Dr. Millhop’s chair groaned, as 
he leaned forward suddenly. His 
voice was cold death in an angry 
whisper. “Shut up!” 

The Doctor viciously pressed a 
button. A large panel in the wall 
snapped open and two huge, 
square-shouldered, power-androids 
clanked into the room. The Doctor 
pointed. They lifted Raymond’s 
protesting android, and carried it 
from the room. 

Back in the waiting room, Ray- 
mond drummed his fingers nervous- 
ly on the receptionist’s desk. He fin- 
ished his cigar, started another one 
and finished that one. Precisely one 
hour later the little light flashed 
on the Receptionist-Android’s dash- 
board chest. 

“The Doctor will see you again 
YOUR SERVANT, SIR 



and again and again.” 

As Raymond re-entered the 
office, the Doctor was examining a 
folder. 

“Mr. Golden,” Dr. Millhop said 
in a tired voice without looking up, 
“there is absolutely nothing that 
can be done, short of electronic 
lobotomy.” 

Raymond asked, “What is elec- 
tronic lobotomy?” 

“That is tantamount to an en- 
tirely new memory bank. Even then 
we cannot guarantee that some 
other idiosyncrasy will not develop. 
Frankly, I do not recommend it to 
you. It is an expensive process, and 
lobotomys are mainly performed in 
the larger industrial robotic devices, 
where an extremely expensive piece 
of equipment is involved.” 

The chubby man rubbed his 
jaw. “Fve got to salvage my invest- 
ment somehow. How much will it 
cost?” 

“Three thousand dollars.” 

Raymond shrugged sadly, turned 
and walked out of the room. 

The Receptionist-Android looked 
up at him and said impersonally, 
“You will receive the Doctor’s 
enormous bill by Telefacs.” 

As Raymond entered his apart- 
ment, disillusioned and exhausted, 
the Four O’clock News-Facs, con- 
taining his want-ad, was sputtering 
out of the receiver. 

When the News-Facs had ceased 
its chattering, he scanned the paper, 
grunted a resentful satisfaction, and 
slumped into his favorite chair. 

He sat and fidgeted, and waited 
and waited, until darkness fell. But 
there was no response to his ad. 

SOL BOREN 


Finally he said to the android, 
“Looks as if you and I were meant 
for each other forever and ever.” 
“Certainly, sir,” replied the an- 
droid. “You need a stable, intelli-. 
gent advisor and mentor to save 
you from your frequent, horrifying 
errors of human judgment. For in- 
stance, I could have told you in 
advance that electronic butcher 
could not so much as cure head- 
aches in a buzzsaw. In short, sir, 
you will never find a finer, more 
loyal, more capable android than 
myself. Put yourself entirely in my 
hands. I will even do your think- 
ing for you.” 

Raymond shook his head wearily, 
and remarked, “I am both excru- 
ciatingly sad and divinely happy at 
that information.” 

“I am mystified at your sadness, 
sir, though gratified at any little 
happiness I might bring into your 
drab, miserable existence.” 

Raymond said mildly, almost too 
mildly, “Shut up.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

With an effort the chubby man 
got to his feet, walked to the bar 
and poured himself a long drjnk. 

The following morning Ray- 
mond, finding his body host to a 
horrible hangover, staggered into 
the living room, and fumbled be- 
hind the bar for a small plastic con- 
tainer, which was labeled : HANG- 
OVER-OVER 

He removed two blue pills and 
tossed them into his mouth. 

When Raymond was halfway 
through his second cup of coffee, 
he suddenly jumped to his feet and 
snapped his fingers. “I’ve got it. 
What a tremendous, frightening 

75 



idea. But it might work.” 

He raced over to the Televisor 
and put in another call to Allied- 
News-Facs. 

A half hour later the ad was 
coming out of the News-Facs ma- 
chine in an excited staccato that 
matched Raymond’s quickening 
pulse. 

As soon as the ad was printed, 
he ripped it out of the receiver: 
WILL TRADE MY CRAZY 
MIXED UP ANDROID FOR 
YOURS 

Raymond grinned happily for 
the first time in days. “Ingenious.” 
The android said, “A complete, 
hopeless waste of human endeavor, 
sir. However, it is quite typical of 
your impulsive and somewhat ob- 
noxious personality.” 

Raymond laughed. “Say any- 
thing you like, my vanishing serv- 
ant. You are not long for my little 
world.” 

Thirty minutes later the automa- 
tic door-announcer sang out: “Visi- 
tor!” 

Raymond set the door control on 
automatic. A tall, thin, haggard 
looking man entered and offered 
his moist hand in a feeble grip. 
“My name is Groober.” He pointed 
weakly at the glistening android 
behind him. “Tins is George.” 
Raymond stared hopefully at 
George and said, “Our android was 
once fondly known as Francois, but 
we’ve since been unable to think of 
it as anything but It ” 

Mr. Groober sat down with a 
sigh, and said in a hoarse voice, 
“This idiotic robotic device has a 
chemurgical complex.” 

George, the android, stared at 

76 


Raymond. “Sir, you have an ex- 
tremely high fat content.” 
Raymond briefly described his 
android to Mr. Groober, and the 
latter shook his head sadly. “Looks 
as if they’ve got a lot in common.” 
Raymond nodded sympatheti- 
cally. 

The door-announcer sang out 
again: “Visitor!” 

A little old lady entered. “I am 
Mrs. Quimby,” she announced in a 
squeaky voice. “And this is Daisy.” 
Daisy followed her in, walking on 
its hands. Raymond stared curiously 
at Daisy and remarked, “That’s a 
new twist.” 

Mrs. Quimby said with bitter- 
ness, “That ain’t all Daisy does.” 
Daisy suddenly collapsed to the 
floor, leaped to its feet, and began 
jumping up and down. Its feet hit 
the floor with a crash; it’s head hit 
the ceiling with a thud; up and 
down, up and down. 

Raymond asked, “How do you 
stop it? My ceiling can’t take much 
more of that.” 

Mrs. Quimby said, “Don’t know. 
Depends on the ceiling.” 

“Visitor!” The door-announcer 
cried again in its one-word recorded 
glee. 

A large android walked in ahead 
of a short, perspiring man. The 
android announced, “I am Ulysses, 
the greatest android ever produced. 
This poor creature is my old, worn 
out owner. I am here to find. a new, 
strong, vigorous owner. Which one 
of you is interested?” 

The door-announcer sang out 
again and again. In two hours the 
little apartment was jammed with 
human beings and inhuman an- 

YOUR SERVANT, SIR 



droids. The interviewing process 
no longer involved Raymond alone. 
It became an interwoven, complex 
affair. 

The confused, excited melee con- 
tinued on through the night. It 
lasted all through the following day 
and night, and on into the day 
after, when the last guest left with 
his militaristic android counting ca- 
dence in a loud grating voice. 

Raymond mixed a strong drink 
and collapsed into his chair, mut- 
tering to himself, “How utterly, ut- 
terly hopeless. There wasn’t a single 
android that didn’t have some glar- 
ing incurable idiosyncrasy that 
could drive Paula and me complete- 
ly out of our minds as easily as our 
present mechanized helpmate.” He 
appealed to the cracked ceiling. 
“What am I going to do?” 

His android said, “You look like 
a tired, fat old man.” 

“Shut up.” 

The android stared at Raymond 
and asked, “What fiendish, dia- 
bolical, sure-fire scheme have you 
devised in that tiny, inadequate hu- 
man brain of yours now, sir?” 
Raymond leered at the android. 
Perspiration was breaking out all 
over his body. His lower lip began 
to tremble and his cheek twitched. 

Raymond tapped hip forehead. 
“When science fails,” he said in a 


hoarse whisper, “there is but pne 
method left for a poor, ignorant 
savage with a primitive brain.” 

Moving forward swiftly, Ray- 
mond bent over, and seized the 
floating ebony end-table in both 
hands. 

“Gome here, oh, modest, unas- 
suming, subservient one. I want to 
bend your ear.” 

Raymond lunged forward and 
swung. The android dodged awk- 
wardly, and the table top glanced 
off the side of its head. 

For a long moment the android 
remained quiet and motionless. 
Finally it said, “Did you ring, sir?” 

The ebony slab slipped from Ray- 
mond’s hands. He squinted at the 
android from under drooping, red- 
rimmed eyelids. 

The android’s head remained 
perfectly still. Its eyes did not fol- 
low him. 

Raymond stepped over to the 
bar, made tinkling noises with the 
bottles, and waited tensely. 

Silence. Pure silence. 

The stillness of the room was 
suddenly warm and friendlv. As- 
tonishment swept over Raymond 
in a dizzy wave. He asked in an 
excited whisper, “Who are you?” 

The android turned towards him 
and bowed humbly. “Your servant.

BRAIN TEASER 


BY TOM GODWIN 


ARL ENGLE stood aside as 
the flight preparation crew filed 
out of the Argo?/s airlock. Barnes 
was the last; fat and bald and 
squinting against the brightness of 
the Arizona sun. 

“All set, Carl,” he said. “They 
had us to check and countercheck, 
especially the drives.” 

Engle nodded. “Good. Ground 
Control reports the Slug cruiser 
still circling seven hundred miles 
out and they think the Slugs sus- 
pect something.” 


“Damned centipedes!” Barnes 
said. “I still say they’re telepathic.” 
He looked at his watch. Zero hour 
minus twenty-six minutes. “Good 
luck, boy, and I hope this space 
warp dingus works like they think 
it will.” 

He waddled down the boarding 
ramp and Engle went through the 
airlock, frowning a little as he 
threw the switches that would with- 
draw the ramp and close the airlock 
behind him. Barnes’ implied doubt 
in the success of the space warp 



78 



shuttle was not comforting. If the 
shuttle failed to work, the Argosy 
would be on the proverbial spot 
with the Slug cruiser eager to 
smear it well thereupon . 

Access to the control room was 
up through the room that housed 
the space warp shuttle. Dr. 
Harding, the tall, bristle-browed 
physicist, and his young assistant, 
Garvin, looked up briefly as he 
entered then returned their atten- 
tion to their work. The master com- 
puter, borrowed from M.I.T., stood 
like a colossal many-dialed refriger- 
ator along one wall. A protective 
railing around it bore a blunt 


KEEP OUT sign and it was never 
left unwatched. Garvin was seated 
before it, his fingers flitting over 
the keyboard and the computer’s 
answer panel replying with strange 
mathematical symbols. 

The space warp shuttle sat in the 
middle of the room, a cube approxi- 
mately two-thirds of a meter along 
the edge, studded with dials and 
knobs and surmounted by a ball of 
some shining silvery alloy. Dr. Har- 
ding was talking into the transdi- 
mensional communicator mounted 
beside the shuttle. 

Engle went on to the computer 
and waited outside the railing until

Garvin finished with his work and 
turned in his seat to face him. 

“The last check question,” Gar- 
vin said. “Now to sweat out the 
last twenty minutes.” 

“If you’ve got the time, how 
about telling me about the shuttle,” 
said Engle, “I’ve been kept in the 
dark about it; but from what I un- 
derstand, the shuttle builds up a 
field around the ship, with the silver 
ball as the center of the field, and 
this field goes into another dimen- 
sion called the ‘space warp’.” 

“Ah — it could be described in 
that manner,” Garvin said, smiling 
a little. “A clear description could 
not be made without the use of 
several special kinds of mathema- 
tics, but you might say this field 
in normal space is like a bubble 
under water. The air bubble seeks 
its own element, rises rapidly until 
it emerges into free air — in this 
case, the space warp. This transi- 
tion into the warp is almost in- 
stantaneous and the shuttle auto- 
matically ceases operation when the 
warp is fully entered. The shuttle 
is no longer needed ; the hypo- 
thetical bubble no longer exists — it 
has found its own element and 
merged with it.” 

“I know that a light-hour of 
travel in the warp is supposed to be 
equivalent to several light-years in 
normal space,” Engle said, “but 
what about when you want to get 
back into normal space?” 

“The original process is simply 
reversed : the shuttle creates a ‘bub- 
ble’ that cannot exist in the warp 
and seeks its own element, normal 
space.” 

“I see. But if the shuttle 


should — ’” 

He never completed the question. 
Dr. Harding strode over, his eyes 
blue and piercing under the fierce 
eyebrows as he fixed them on him. 
He spoke without preamble: 

“You realize the importance of 
this test flight with the shuttle, of 
course? Entirely aside from our 
personal survival should the Slug 
cruiser intercept us.” 

“Yes, sir,” he answered, feeling 
the question suggested an even 
lower opinion of his intelligence 
than he had thought Harding held. 

Project Space Warp existed for 
the purpose of sending the Argosy 
to Sirius by means of the space 
warp shuttle and bringing back the 
Thunderbolt by the same swift 
method. The Thunderbolt , Earth’s 
first near-to-light-speed interstellar 
ship, was a huge ship; armed, ar- 
mored, and invincible. It had been 
built to meet every conceivable 
danger that might be encountered 
in interstellar exploration — but the 
danger had come to the solar sys- 
tem from the direction of Capella 
nine years after the departure of 
the Thunderbolt . Eight cruisers 
of the pulpy, ten-foot centipede-like 
things called Slugs had methodical- 
ly destroyed the colonies on Mars 
and Venus and established their 
own outposts there. Earth’s ground 
defenses had held the enemy at bay 
beyond the atmosphere for a year 
but such defense could not be main- 
tained indefinitely. The Thunder- 
bolt was needed quickly and its own 
drives could not bring it back in 
less than ten years. 

“We will go into the warp well 
beyond the atmosphere,” Harding 

BRAIN TEASER 


80 



said. “Transition cannot be made 
within an atmosphere. Since a very 
moderate normal space velocity of 
the ship will be transformed into a 
greater-than-light velocity when in 
the warp, it is desirable that we 
make turn-over and decelerate to a 
very low speed before going into 
the warp.” 

“Yes, sir,” he said. “I was briefed 
on that part and I’ll bring us as 
near to a halt as that cruiser will 
permit.” 

“There will be communication 
between us during the flight,” Har- 
ding said. “I will give you further 
instructions when they become ne- 
cessary.” 

He turned away with an air of 
dismissal. Engle went to the ladder 
by the wall. He climbed up it and 
through the interroom airlock, clos- 
ing the airlock behind him; the 
routine safety measure in case any 
single room was punctured. He 
went to the control board with a 
vague resentment gnawing for the 
first time at his normally placid 
good nature. 

So far as Harding was concerned 
— and Garvin, too — he might as 
well have been an unusually in- 
telligent baboon. 

Zero hour came and the Argosy 
lifted until Earth was a tremendous, 
curving ball below and the stars 
were brilliant points of light in a 
black sky. The Slug cruiser swung 
to intercept him within the first 
minute of flight but it seemed to 
move with unnatural slowness. It 
should have been driving in at full 
speed and it wasn’t . 

“Something’s up,” Ground Con- 

TOM GODWIN 


trol said. “It’s coming in tod slow- 
ly.” 

“I see that,” he answered. “It 
must be covering something beyond 
it, in your radar shadow.” 

It was. When he was almost free 
of the last traces of atmosphere he 
saw the other cruiser, far out and 
hidden from Ground Control’s 
radar by the radar shadow cast by 
the first one. 

He reported, giving its position 
and course as given him by the 
robot astrogating unit. 

“We’ll have the greatest amount 
of time if I make turn-over now 
and decelerate,” he finished. 

The voice of Harding came 
through the auxiliary speaker: 

“Do so.” 

The Argosy swung, end for end, 
and he decelerated. The cruiser be- 
hind him increased its speed, mak- 
ing certain it would be in position 
to cut off any return to Earth. The 
other cruiser altered its course to 
intersect the point in space the 
Argosy would soon occupy, and the 
Argosy was between the rapidly 
closing jaws of a trap. 

He made reports to Ground Con- 
trol at one-minute intervals. At 
11:49 he said: 

“Our velocity is approaching 
zero. We’ll be within range of the 
second cruiser’s blasters in two more 
minutes.” 

Harding spoke again to him : 

“We’ll go into the warp now. Do 
not alter the deceleration or the 
course of the ship while we’re in 
the warp.” 

“I won’t,” he said. 

There was a faint mutter from 
the auxiliary speaker as Harding 

81 



gave some instructions to Garvin. 
Engle took a last look at the view- 
screen ; at blue-green Earth looming 
large in the center, Orion and 
Sirius glittering above it and the 
sun burning bright and yellow on 
the right. It was a scene he had 
observed many times before, all 
very familiar and normal — 

The chronometer touched 11:50 
and normalcy vanished. 

Earth and sun and stars fled 
away from him, altering in appear- 
ance as they went, shrinking, 
dwindling. The seas and continents 
of Earth erupted and shook and 
boiled before Earth faded and dis- 
appeared. The sun changed from 
yellow to green to blue, to a tiny 
point of bright violet light that 
raced away into the blackness filling 
the screen and faded and disap- 
peared as Earth had done. 

Then the viewscreen was black, 
utterly, completely, dead black. And 
the communicator that had con- 
nected him with Ground Control 
was silent, without the faintest whis- 
per of background sound or space 
static. 

In the silence the voice of Har- 
ding as he spoke to Garvin came 
through the speaker; puzzled, in- 
credulous, almost shocked: 

“Our velocity couldn’t have been 
that great — and the sun receded 
into the ultraviolet!” 

There was the quick sound of 
hurrying footsteps then the more 
distant sound of the computer’s keys 
being operated at a high rate of 
speed. He wanted to ask what had 
gone wrong but he knew no one 
would answer him. And it would 
be a pointless question — it was 

82 


obvious from Harding’s tone that 
he did not know, either. 

He had an unpleasant feeling 
that Man’s first venture into an- 
other dimension had produced 
catastrophic results. What had 
caused sun and Earth to disappear 
so quickly — and what force had 
riven and disfigured Earth? 

Then he realized the significance 
of Harding’s statement about the 
sun receding into the ultraviolet. 

If the ship had been traveling at 
a high velocity away from the sun, 
the wave length of the sun’s light 
would have been increased in pro- 
portion to the speed of the ship. 
The sun should have disappeared 
in the long- wave infrared end of 
the spectrum, not the short-wave 
ultraviolet, 

With the thought came the ex- 
planation of the way the continents 
and oceans of Earth had quivered 
and seethed. The shifting of the 
spectrum range had shortened 
normally visible rays into invisibly 
short ultraviolet radiations while at 
the same time formerly invisible 
long infrared radiations had been 
shortened into visible wave lengths. 
There had been a continuous dis- 
placement into and past the ultra- 
violet and each wave length would 
have reflected best from a different 
place— mountains, valleys, oceans, 
deserts, warm areas, cool areas, — 
and the steady progression into the 
ultraviolet had revealed each area 
in quick succession and given the 
appearance of agitated movement. 

So there was no catastrophe and 
everything had a logical explana- 
tion. Except how they could have 
been approaching a sun that he had 

BRAIN TEASER 



seen clearly, visibly, racing away 
from them, 

“Engle — ” The voice of Harding 
came through the speaker. “We’re 
going back into normal space to 
make another observation. I don’t 
know just where we are but we’re 
certain to be far from the cruisers. 
Don’t alter our course or velocity.” 
“Yes, sir,” he said. 

They came out of the warp at 
11:53. The communicator burped 
suddenly and the viewscreen came 
to life; a deep, dull red that bright- 
ened quickly. A tiny coal flared up, 
swelling in size and shifting from 
red to orange to yellow — the sun. 
Earth appeared as a hazy red dot 
that enlarged and resolved itself 
into a planet with distorted con- 
tinents that trembled and changed, 
to resume their natural shapes and 
colors. Within a few seconds the 
sun was shining as ever, Earth 
loomed large and blue-green before 
them and the stars of Orion glit- 
tered unchanged beyond. Even their 
position in space was the same — 
they had not moved. 

But the Slug cruisers had. 

One was very near and from its 
forward port came the violet haze 
that always preceded a blaster 
beam. There was no time to escape 
— no chance at all. He spoke into 
the mike, harsh and urgent: 

“Into the warp ! There’s a blaster 
beam coming — move!” 

There was a silence from below 
that seemed to last an eternity, then 
the sound of a switch being slapped 
hastily. At the same time, the violet 
haze before the cruiser erupted into 
blue fire and the blaster beam 
lanced out at them. 

TOM GODWIN 


It struck somewhere astern. The 
power output needle swung jerkily 
as thje generators went out and the 
emergency batteries took the heavy 
load of the shuttle’s operation. 
There was a sensation of falling as 
the ship’s artificial gravity units 
ceased functioning. The auxiliary 
speaker rattled wordlessly and there 
was a sound like a hard rush of 
wind through it, accompanied by 
quick bumping sounds. 

Then the speaker was still and 
there was no sound of any kind as 
the viewscreen shifted into the ul- 
traviolet and Earth and stars and 
sun once again raced away and dis- 
appeared in the blackness. 


A MYRIAD of lights above the 
board informed him the gen- 
erators were destroyed, the stem 
section riddled and airless, the 
emergency batteries damaged and 
reduced to quarter charge, the 
shuttle room punctured and airless. 

And, of course, Harding and 
Garvin were dead. 

He felt a surge of futile anger. 
It had all been unnecessary. If only 
they had not considered him incom- 
petent to be entrusted with any- 
thing more than the ship’s opera- 
tion — if only they had installed an 
emergency switch for the shuttle 
by his control board, there would 
not have been the two-second delay 
following his order and they would 
have been safely in the warp before 
the blaster beam struck. 

But they had not trusted him 
with responsibility and now he was 
alone in a space warp he did not 
understand; sole and full responsi- 

83 



bility for the shuttle suddenly in his 
hands. 

He considered his course of ac- 
tion, then got into a pressure suit. 
Magnets in the soles of its heavy 
boots permitted him to walk in the 
absence of gravity and he went to 
the interroom airlock with metal- 
lically clicking steps. He let him- 
self through the lock and walked 
down what had been the room’s 
wall, then across to the center of 
its floor. 

But for the fact there was no one 
in the room, it was as he had last 
seen it. The shuttle, computer, and 
other equipment stood in their 
orderly positions with their lighted 
dials unchanged. Until one looked 
at the gash ripped in the hull and 
saw the stains along its edge where 
the occupants had been hurled 
through it by the escaping air. 

He went on to the next room and 
the next. The damage increased as 
he proceeded toward the stem. The 
power generators were sliced into 
ribbons and the emergency batteries 
in such condition it seemed a 
miracle they were functioning at 
all. The drives had received the 
greatest damage; they were an 
unrecognizable mass of wreckage. 

He made his way back to the 
shuttle room, there to appraise his 
circumstances. He reached auto- 
matically for a cigarette and 
stopped when his glove bumped the 
breast plate of his pressure suit. 

First, he would have to make the 
shuttle room livable; get out of the 
pressure suit. He would have to 
question the computer and he could 
not do that with the thick, clumsy 
gloves on his hands. 

84 


The job didn’t take long. There 
were repair plates on the ship and 
a quick-hardening plastic spray. He 
closed the sternward airlock when 
he was done and opened the airlock 
leading to the control room, as well 
as the locks beyond. Air filled the 
shuttle room, with only a minor 
over-all loss of air pressure. He re- 
moved the suit, attached a pair of 
magnetic soles to his shoes so he 
could operate the keys of the com- 
puter without the movements send- 
ing him floating away, and went to 
it. 

He had never been permitted to 
touch it before, nor even stand close 
enough to see what the keyboard 
looked like. Now, he saw that the 
alphabetical portion of the key- 
board was minor compared with 
the mathematical portion, many of 
the symbols strange to him. 

The operation of an interplan- 
etary ship required a certain knowl- 
edge of mathematics, but not the 
kind used by theoretical physicists. 
He typed, doubtfully: 

ARE YOU CAPABLE OF ANSWERING 
QUESTIONS PRESENTED IN NON- 
MATHEMATICAL FORM? 

The word, YES, appeared at 
once in the answer panel and relief 
came to him like the lifting of a 
heavy burden. 

The computer knew as much 
about the space warp as Harding or 
anyone else. It was connected with 
his drive controls and instruments 
and knew how far, how fast, and in 
what directions the flight had taken 
place. It had even been given blue- 
prints of the ship’s construction, in 
case the structure of the ship should 
affect the ship’s performance in the 

BRAIN TEASER 



warp, and knew every nut, bolt, 
plate and dimension in the ship. 

There was supposed to be a ce*^ 
tain method of procedure when 
questioning the computer. “It 
knows — but it can’t think,” Garvin 
had one said. “It lacks the initia- 
tive to correlate data and arrive at 
conclusions unless the proceedure of 
correlation is given it in detail.” 

Perhaps he could manage to out- 
line some method of correlation for 
the computer. The facts of his 
predicament were simple enough: 

He was in an unknown medium 
called “the Space Warp.” Some- 
thing not anticipated occurred 
when a ship went into the warp 
and Harding had not yet solved the 
mystery when he died. The physi- 
cists in Observation would be able 
to find the answer but he could not 
ask them. The forward movement 
of the ship was not tranferred with 
it into the warp and if he emerged 
into normal space the waiting Slug 
cruisers would disintegrate him be- 
fore he spoke three words to Ob- 
servation. 

There was a pencil and a tablet 
of paper by the computer. He used 
them to calculate the time at which 
the charge in the damaged batteries 
would reach a critical low, beyond 
which the charge would be in- 
sufficient to activate the shuttle. 

The answer was 13:53. He would 
have to go out of the warp at 13 : 53 
or remain in it forever. He had a 
great deal less than two hours in 
which to act. 

He typed the first question to the 
computer: 

WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THIS 
SHIP RELATIVE TO NORMAL SPACE? 


The answer appeared on the 
panel at once; the coordinates of a 
position more than a light-year to- 
ward Ophiuchus. 

He stared at the answer, feeling 
it must be an error. But it could not 
be an error — the computer did not 
make mistakes. How, then, could 
the ship have traveled more than 
a light-year during its second stay 
in the warp when it had not moved 
at all during the first stay? Had 
some factor of the warp unknown 
to him entered the picture? 

As a check he typed another 
question : 

WHAT WAS OUR POSITION, RELA- 
TIVE TO NORMAL SPACE, IMMEDI- 
ATELY BEFORE THIS SHIP WAS 
SHUTTLED BACK OUT OF THE WARP? 

The answer was a position light- 
days toward Ophiuchus. 

He typed: impossible. 

The computer replied : this 

STATEMENT CONFLICTS WITH PRE- 
VIOUS DATA. 

He recalled the importance of 
keeping the computer free of all 
faulty or obscure data and typed 
quickly: cancel conflicting 

statement. 

conflicting statement can- 
celed, it replied. 

He tried another tack, this ship 

EMERGED FROM THE SPACE WARP 
INTO THE SAME NORMAL SPACE 
POSITION IT HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE 
GOING INTO THE WARP. 

He thought the computer would 
proceed to give him some sort of 
an explanation. Instead, it non- 
committally replied : data ac- 

knowledged. 

He typed : explain this dis- 
crepancy between space warp 


TOM GODWIN 


85 



AND NORMAL SPACE POSITIONS. 

It answered: insufficient data 
to account for discrepancy. 

He asked, how did you deter- 
mine our present position? 

It replied: by triangulation, 

BASED ON THE RECESSION OF 
EARTH, THE SUN, SIRIUS, ORION, 
AND OTHER STARS. 

BUT THE RECEDINO SUN WENT 

into the ultraviolet, he ob- 
jected. 

Again it answered with the non- 
commital, data acknowledged. 

DID YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS 

data? he asked. 

YES. 

EXPLAIN WHY THE RECEDINO SUN 
SHIFTED INTO THE ULTRAVIOLET IN- 
STEAD OF THE INFRARED. 

It replied: data insufficient 

TO ARRIVE AT LOGICAL EXPLANATION. 

He paused, pondering his next 
move. Time was speeding by and 
he was learning nothing of value. 
He would have to move the ship 
to some place in the warp where 
emergence into normal space would 
not put him under the blasters of 
the Slug cruisers. He could not 
know where to move the ship until 
he knew where the ship was at the 
present. He did not believe it was in 
the position given him by the com- 
puter, and its original space warp 
position had certainly not been the 
one given by the computer. 

The computer did not have the 
ability to use its knowledge to ex- 
plain contradictory data. It had 
been ordered to compute their 
space warp position by triangula- 
tion of the receding sun and stars 
and was not at all disturbed by the 
contradicting shift of the sun into 

86 


the ultraviolet. Suppose it had been 
ordered to calculate their position 
by computations based on the shift 
of the sun’s and stars* spectrum into 
the ultraviolet? 

He asked it: what is our posi- 
tion, IGNORING THE TRIANGULA- 
TION AND BASING YOUR COMPUTA- 
TIONS ON THE SHIFT OF THE 
SPECTRUMS OF THE SUN AND ORION 
INTO THE ULTRAVIOLET? 

It gave him the coordinates of a 
position almost two light-years to- 
ward Orion. The triangulation 
computations had shown the ship 
to be going backward at many 
times the speed of light; the spec- 
trum-shift computations showed it 
to be going forward with approxi-

UNDERSTAND. CLARIFY QUESTION. 

He got out of the computer seat 
and walked about the room restless- 
ly. He passed by the transdimen- 
sional viewscreen and communica- 
tor and pressed the communicator’s 
signal button. A dial flickered in 
return, showing his signal was going 
out, but there was no sound in 
response. If only he could make 
contact with the brains in Observa- 
tion — 

He was umpty billion miles east 
of the sun and umpty billion miles 
west of the sun. He was racing 
faster than light in two different 
directions at once and he was 
sitting motionless under the blasters 
of two Slug cruisers. 

Another thought came to him: 
even if he could move the ship 
while in the warp, where could he 
go? 

He would have to go far beyond 
the outer limits of the solar system 
to escape detection by the Slug 
cruisers. And at that distance the 
sun would be only a yellow star, in- 
capable of energizing the little solar 
power units. He would not live long 
after the last of the power was 
drained from the batteries and the 
air regeneration equipment ceased 
functioning. He would not even 
dare sleep, toward the last. There 
were no convection currents in the 
air of a ship without gravity, and 
it was imperative that the air be 
circulated constantly. The air cir- 
culation blowers would cease func- 
tioning while the ship still contained 
pure air but he would have to move 
about continually to breathe that 
air. Should he lie down to sleep he 
would smother to death in a carbon 


87 



dioxide bubble of his own making. 

If he managed to emerge into 
normal space at some point just 
outside Earth’s atmosphere, beyond 
range of the cruisers, his driveless 
ship would descend as a blazing 
meteor. If, by some miracle, he 
could emerge into normal space 
just a few inches above the space- 
field it would be to materialize into 
space already occupied by air. 
Such a materialization would be 
simultaneously fatal to him and 
to the electronic components of the 
shuttle and computer. 

And if he did not move the ship, 
the Slug cruisers would disintegrate 
him. He had four hypothetical 
choices of his way to die, all equally 
unpleasant. 

He smiled wanly at his reflection 
in the bright metal bordering the 
viewscreen and said, “Brother — 
you’ve had it!” 


H E WENT to the control room, 
there to brush his fingers across 
the useless control buttons and 
look into the viewscreen that re- 
vealed only black and limitless 
Nothing. 

What was the warp? Surely it 
must have definite physical laws of 
some kind. It was difficult to 
imagine any kind of existence — 
even the black nothing of the warp 
— as being utterly without rule or 
reason. If he knew the laws of the 
warp he might find some means of 
survival hitherto hidden from him. 

There was only one way he 
could learn about the warp. He 
would have to question the com- 
puter and continue questioning it 

88 


until he learned or until his time 
was up. 

He returned to the computer and 
considered his next question. The 
computer had calculated their posi- 
tions from observations of the sun 
and other stars in front of the ship 
— what would similar calculations 
based on observations of the stars 
behind the ship reveal? He typed: 

USE FIRST THE TRIANGULATION 
METHOD AND THEN THE SPECTRUM- 
SHIFT METHOD TO DETERMINE OUR 
POSITION FROM OBSERVATIONS 
MADE OF THE STARS OF OPHIUCHUS. 

The answers appeared. They 
showed the ship to be simultaneous- 
ly speeding away from Ophiuchus 
and toward it. 

He asked: do these two posi- 
tions COINCIDE WITH THOSE RE- 
SULTING FROM THE OBSERVATIONS 
OF ORION? 

yes, it answered. 

Was the paradox limited to the 
line of flight? 

He asked the computer: what 

IS OUR POSITION, COURSE AND 

SPEED as indicated by the stars 

AT RIGHT-ANGLES TO OUR FORWARD- 
BACKWARD COURSE; BY THE STARS 
OF URSA MINOR AND CRUX? 

The answer appeared on the 
panel : the ship was racing sideward 
through the warp in two dia- 
metrically opposed directions, but 
at only one-third the speed with 
which it was racing forward and 
backward. 

So now the ship had four im- 
possible positions and two different 
speeds. 

He frowned at the computer, 
trying to find some clue in the new 
data. He noticed, absently, that the 

BRAIN TEASER 



hand of one of the dials was near 
zero in the red section of the dial. 
He had not noticed any of the diaL 
registering in the danger zone be- 
fore . 

He jerked out of his preoccupa- 
tion with apprehension and typed: 

TELL ME IN NON-TECHNICAL LAN- 
GUAGE THE MEANING OF THE HAND 
NEAR ZERO ON THE DIAL LABELED 

MAX . ET. REF . 

It answered: one of my cir- 
cuits WAS DAMAGED BY THE SUD- 
DEN RELEASE OF AIR PRESSURE. I 
WILL CEASE FUNCTIONING AT THE 
END OF FOUR MORE MINUTES OF 
OPERATION. 

He slammed the master switch to 
OFF. The lights on the board went 
out, the various needles swung to 
zero, leaving the computer a mind- 
less structure more than ever re- 
sembling an overgrown refrigerator. 

Four minutes more of operation 
. and he had so many questions 
to ask before he could hope to learn 
enough about the warp to know 
what he should do. He had wasted 
almost an hour of the computer’s 
limited life, leaving it turned on 
when he was not using it. If only it 
had told him . but it was not the 
nature of a machine to voluntarily 
give information. Besides, the re- 
ceding hand of the dial was there 
for him to see. The computer 
neither knew nor cared that no one 
had thought it worthwhile to teach 
him the rudiments of its operation 
and maintenance. 

It was 12:52. One hour and one 
minute left. 

He put the thought aside and 
concentrated on the problem of 
finding tfie key to the paradox. 

TOM GODWIN 


What conceivable set of circum- 
stances would cause receding stars 
to have a spectrum shift that 
showed them to be approaching the 
ship? Or, to rephrase the question, 
what conceivable set of circum- 
stances would cause approaching 
stars to appear to dwindle in size? 

The answer came with startling 
suddenness and clarity: 

There was no paradox — the ship 
was expanding. 

He considered the solution, ex- 
amining it for flaws of logic, and 
found none. If he and the ship were 
expanding the wave length of light 
would diminish in proportion to the 
increasing size of the retinas of his 
eyes and the scanner plates of 
the transdimensional viewscreens: 
would become shorter and go into 
the ultraviolet. At the same time, 
the increasing size of himself and 
the ship would make the Earth and 
sun relatively smaller and therefore 
apparently receding. 

The same theory explained the 
two different speeds of the ship : its 
length was three times its diameter 
so its longitudinal expansion would 
proceed at three times the speed of 
its cross-sectional expansion. 

Everything checked. 

How large was the ship now? 

He made a rough calculation and 
stared almost unbelievingly at the 
results. He was a giant, more than 
a third of a light-year tall, in a ship 
that was six light-years long and 
two light-years in diameter. Far 
Centauri, which had required thirty 
years to reach in the fastest inter- 
planetary ship, floated seventy-one 
feet away in the blackness outside 
the hull. 


89 



And the sun and Earth were in 
the room with him, going into the 
shuttle’s silvery focal ball. 

He would have to ask the com- 
puter to make certain his theory 
was valid. His time was too cri- 
tically short for him to waste any of 
it with speculation based on an 
erroneous theory. 

He switched on the computer 
and it lighted up again. He typed 
rapidly : 

ASSUME THIS SHIP TO BE MO- 
TIONLESS AND EXPANDING WOULD 
THAT THEORY SATISFACTORILY EX- 
PLAIN ALL THE HITHERTO CONTRA- 
DICTORY PHENOMENA? 

There was a brief pause as the 
computer evaluated its data, then 
it answered with one word: 

YES. 

He switched it off again, to 
squander none of its short period of 
usefulness until he had decided 
upon what his further questions 
should be. At last, he had some 
grounds for conjecture ; had learned 
something about the warp the de- 
signers of the shuttle had not sus- 
pected. Their calculations had been 
correct when they showed a ship 
would travel in the warp at many 
times the normal space speed of 
light. But somewhere some little 
factor had been overlooked — or 
never found — and their precise 
mathematics had not indicated that 
the travel would be produced by 
expansion. 

Nature abhors a vacuum . And 
the black, empty warp was a 
vacuum more perfect than any that 
existed in normal space. In the 
normal space universe there were 
millions of stars in the galaxy and 

90 


millions of galaxies. In the warp 
there was utter Nothing. Did the 
physical laws of the warp demand 
that matter be scattered through- 
out it, in emulation of its rich neigh- 
bor in the adjoining dimension? 
Was the warp hungry for matter? 

He rejected the thought as fan- 
tasy. There was some explanation 
that the physicists would eventually 
find. Perhaps there was a vast size- 
ratio difference between the two 
dimensions; perhaps the warp was 
far larger than the normal space 
universe and some co-universal law 
demanded that objects entering it 
become proportionally larger. 

None of that aspect of his cir- 
cumstances, however, was of im- 
portance. There was only one 
prime problem facing him : how to 
move the ship within less than an 
hour to some point in the warp 
where his emergence into normal 
space would result in neither instant 
nor days-away death and where he 
would have the time to try to carry 
out the responsibility, so suddenly 
placed in his hands, of delivering 
the space warp shuttle to the Thun - 
derbolt. 

The long-range task depended 
upon his immediate survival. He 
had to move the ship, and how did 
a man move a driveless ship? It 
might not require a very large pro- 
pulsive force — perhaps even an oxy- 
gen tank would serve as a jet. 
Except that he had none. 

He could use part of the air in 
the ship. Its sudden release should 
move the ship. There was a sun 
very near: Alpha Cenjauri. If he 
had the proper tools, and the time, 
he could cut a hole in the hull op- 

BRAIN TEASER 



posite Centauri . but he had 
neither the took nor the time. , , 

And what good would it do him 
if he could emerge into normal 
space at the desired distance from 
Centauri? He would be provided 
with power for the air regenerators 
by the solar power units but not 
power sufficient to operate the 
shuttle. He would breathe, and eat, 
for a week. Then the small amount 
of food on the ship would be gone 
and he would breathe for another 
four or five weeks. And then he 
would die of starvation and his 
driveless ship would continue its 
slow drift into the sun, taking his 
bones and the shuttle with it. 

He would have to go to Sirius 
and he would have to reach it the 
first try or never. If he could emerge 
into normal space at the proper dis- 
tance from Sirius he would have 
power from it to operate the com- 
municator. The Thunderbolt would 
come at once when it received his 
message and swallow the little 
Argosy in its enormous hold. The 
return to Earth would be the swift 
one through the warp and the Slug 
cruisers, so bold in pursuit of un- 
armed interplanetary ships, would 
quickly cease to exist. 

At 13:53 Sirius would be some- 
where in or near the bow of the 
ship. The ship would not have to be 
moved more than two thirds of its 
length — twenty meters. He could 
do that by releasing part of the air 
in the shuttle room through the 
sternward airlock. 

How much air? 

He tried to remember long-for- 
gotten formulas. So many cubic feet 
of air at such and such a pressure 

TOM GODWIN 


when released through an opening 
of such and such a diameter would 
exert a propulsive force of . Hell, 
he didn’t know. And not even the 
computer would be able to tell him 
because there were so many un- 
known factors, such as the propor- 
tion of the ship’s mass lost to the 
Slug blasters, the irregular shape of 
the airlock opening, the degree of 
smoothness of its metal. 

He made calculations with pen- 
cil and paper. He would have to 
move the ship with extreme preci- 
sion. A light-hour short of the 
proper distance put him too far 
from the sun for it to power the 
communicator, a light-hour beyond 
put him in the sun’s flaming white 
heart. One light-hour out of eight 
point six light-years was approxi- 
mately one part out of seventy-five 
thousand. He would have to move 
the ship with an accuracy of point 
aught three centimeters — one hun- 
dredth of an inch. 

One hundredth of an inch! 

He laid the pencil , back down, 
almost numbly. He could never 
open and close an airlock and move 
a mass of thousands of tons with an 
accuracy of a hundredth of an inch. 
The very thought was wildly fan- 
tastic. 

He was already far closer to Sirius 
than he would be if he tried to get 
any closer. And that was over eight 
light-years from it. 

He looked at the chronometer 
and saw the hands had already 
reached 13:20.. Thirty-three min- 
utes left to him. Sirius was near — 
soon it would be in the bow of the 
ship — and Sirius was eight point six 
light-years away. 


91 



How could he move the ship a 
certain distance accurate to one 
hundredth of an inch? He couldn’t. 
The answer was blunt and ugly and 
irrefutable: he couldn’t. 

He got up and walked across the 
room, feeling like a man who had 
in quick succession been con- 
demned. reprieved, recondemned. 
He had been projected into a situa- 
tion for which he had had no pre- 
liminary training whatever; had 
been made sole custodian and 
operator of a computer and a 
space warp shuttle that he had 
never before been permitted to 
touch. He had used the sound but 
not at all brilliant mind nature had 
given him to solve the riddle of the 
paradoxes and learn where he was 
and where he wanted to go. He 
had done quite well — he had solved 
every problem of his survival and 
the shuttle’s delivery except the last 
one! 

He passed by the shuttle and 
stopped to rest his hand on the 
bright, silvery focal ball. The solar 
system would be deep inside the 
ball; the atoms of the ball larger 
than Earth, perhaps, and far more 
impalpable than the thinnest air. 
The Slug cruisers would be in there, 
infinitesimally tiny, waiting for him 
to return . 

No — faulty reasoning. The solar 
system was as it had always been, 
not diminished in size and not really 
in the ball. It was only that two 
different points in two different di- 
mensions coincided in the ball . 

He saw the answer. 

He did not have to move the ship 
to Sirius — he had only to move the 
ball! 


T HERE WOULD be little time, 
very little time. First, to see if 
the warp shuttle was portable — 

It was. When he unfastened the 
clamp that held it to the stand it 
lifted up freely, trailing a heavy 
cable behind it. He saw it was only 
a power supply cable, with a plug 
that would fit one of the sockets in 
the bow of the ship. He left the 
shuttle floating in the air, leashed 
by the cable, and went to the com- 
puter. Next, he would have to know 
if Sirius would be fully in the ship — 
He switched the computer on 
and typed : 

DETERMINE THE DISTANCE FROM 
THE CENTER OF THE WARP SHUT- 
TLE’S FOCAL BALL TO THE SPACE 
WARP POSITION OF SIRIUS AT 13:53, 
BASING YOUR COMPUTATIONS ON 
THE EXPANDING-SHIP THEORY. 

It gave him the answer a mo- 
ment later: 18.3496 METERS. 

He visualized the distance, from 
his knowledge of the ship’s interior, 
and saw the position would be with- 
in the forward spare-parts room. 

Next, to learn exactly where in 
that room he should place the shut- 
tle. He could not do so by measur- 
ing from the present position of the 
shuttle. The most precise steel tape 
would have to be at exactly the 
right temperature for such a meas- 
urement to be neither too short nor 
too long. He had no such tape, and 
the distance from the focal ball was 
only part of the necessary measur- 
ing: he would have to measure off 
a certain distance and a precisely 
certain angle from the purely 
imaginary central line of the ship’s 
axis to intersect the original line. 
Such a measurement would be im- 


92 


BRAIN TEASER 



possible in die time he had. 

He considered what would be his 
last question to the computer. The' 
hand was touching the zero and his 
question would have to be worded 
very clearly and subject to no mis- 
interpretations. There would be 
no follow-up questions permitted. 

He began typing: 

IT IS DESIRED THAT THIS SHIP 
EMERGE INTO NORMAL SPACE ONE 
LIGHT-HOUR THIS SIDE OF SIRIUS 
AT 13:53. THIS WILL BE ACCOM- 
PLISHED BY MOVING THE WARP 
SHUTTLE TO SUCH A POSITION THAT 
ITS FOCAL CENTER WILL BE IN A 
SPACE WARP POSITION COINCIDING 
WITH A NORMAL SPACE POSITION 
ONE LIGHT-HOUR THIS SIDE OF 

sirius at 13:53. consider all 

FACTORS THAT MIGHT HAVE AF- 
FECTED THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS 
SHIP, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE 
CHANGES PRODUCED BY OUR NOR- 
MAL SPACE ACCELERATION AND DE- 
CELERATION, WHEN COMPUTING 
THE POSITION OF SIRIUS. THEN 
DEFINE THAT LOCATION IN RELA- 
TION TO THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES 
OF THE ROOM’S INTERIOR. DO THIS 
IN SUCH A MANNER THAT PLACING 
THE SHUTTLE IN THE PROPER POSI- 
TION WILL REQUIRE THE LEAST POS- 
SIBLE AMOUNT OF MEASURING 
DISTANCES AND ANGLES. 

It seemed to take it an unduly 
long time to answer the question 
and he waited restlessly, unpleasant- 
ly aware of the hand touching zero 
and wondering if the computer’s 
mind was baffled by the question; 
the mind that thought best in terms 
of orderly mathematics and could 
not know or care that measurement 
by protractor and tape would result 

TOM GODWIN 


in a position fatally far from that 
described by the neat, rigid figures. 

Then the answer appeared, beau- 
tifully concise: 

POSITION WILL BE IN CORNER OF 
ROOM, 764.2 CENTIMETERS ABOVE 
FLOOR PLATE, 820 CENTIMETERS 
PERPENDICULAR TO PANEL AA, 
652.05 CENTIMETERS PERPENDICU- 
LAR TO PANEL AB. 

The computer died with an oddly 
human sigh. Its last act had been 
to give him the location of Sirius 
in such a manner that he could ac- 
curately position the shuttle’s focal 
ball with the aid of the precision 
measuring devices in the ship’s re- 
pair room. 

He went to the shuttle and 
picked it up in his arms. It was 
entirely weightless, and each mag- 
net-clicking step he took toward the 
bow of the ship brought Sirius al- 
most half a light-year nearer. 

He squinted against the white 
glare of Sirius in the viewscreen as 
he continued his terse report to the 
Th underbolt’s commander: “I have 
about a week’s supply of food. How 
long will it be until you reach me?” 

The commander’s reply came 
after the pause caused by the dis- 
tance involved: 

“We’ll be there within three days. 
Go ahead and eat hearty. But how 
did you travel from Earth to Sirius 
in only two hours? My God, man — 
what kind of a drive did that ship 
have?” 

“Why, it didn’t have any drive 
from the start,” he said. “To get 
here I” — he frowned thoughtfully 
— “you might say I walked and car- 
ried the ship.” • • •

It was a terrific theory and it would send Man to the stars. 
But the two men involved had to buck more than physical 
laws; and so the project was finished, over, done with. 
Unless . 


Corbow's Theory 

BY LEE WALLOT 


“ A LL RIGHT! So we’ve got it. 

The same problem rocket de- 
signers have been struggling with 
for five years. Nobody’s found the 
answer — and they never will!” 
Bronsen Corbow glared at the 
older man, his lips pressed tightly 
together to keep from giving voice 
to the anger mounting inside of 
him. Mars Kenton was an argu- 
mentive old fool, but the company 
had made him his assistant and 
nothing could be done about it. 

“They’ve known ever since they 
discovered that interstellar drive,” 
Mars continued, “that they can 


only make enough Carbolium to 
send four ships a year to the end 
of our galaxy and back again. Is 
it our fault they have to make the 
blasted stuff instead of mining it 
out of the ground?” 

The words ringing in the quiet 
of the laboratory seemed to pound 
in Bronsen’s ears and he found he 
could hold his tongue no longer. He 
leaned toward the older physicist 
and slammed his hand down on the 
table. 

“That’s enough, Mars. I happen 
to be the one in charge here, not 
you.” His quiet voice made clear 


94 







the anger he felt. “Reed turned the 
problem over to us. I say we can 
lick it. Just because my chief as- 
sistant is still thinking in terms of 
ancient history, it’s no reason to 
send back a report from this labor- 
atory saying we can’t handle the 
problem.” He ran a trembling hand 
through his close-cropped hair and 
swore at himself when he saw Mars 
noticed the trembling. Why did 
he have to start shaking every time 
he got mad? The person he was 
mad at invariably took the shaking 
to be fear, and he would always be 
forced to drive his point home all 
the harder in order to get the re- 
spect he demanded. 

Mars Kenton sneered. “Mind 
telling me just how you are going 
to eliminate interstellar drive from 
our rocket ships? Or have you 
cooked up another of your bright 
ideas to try out at the company’s 
expense?” 

“I’m fed up with you, Mars!” All 
control over his temper was gone 
now and the younger man gave full 
vent to his anger. His powerful 
body fairly bristled in his rage and 
in spite of himself Mars was forced 
to cringe beneath the assailing roars 
that followed. “You may be twenty 
years older than I am; you may 
have been one of the pioneers in 
space travel; you may still be a 
good man if you could forget that 
the whole world didn’t plot that 
accident that left you with a bad 
leg — but you’re still taking orders 
from me. We have some good men 
in this department, and you can 
either keep your mouth shut and 
work with us or you can get out. 
Interstellar drive isn’t the only solu- 

96 


tion to space travel and the answer 
to the problem is going to come 
from this laboratory. Now take 
your choice!” 

Mars glared at Bronsen and 
seethed inwardly but swung back 
to his work table. His right leg 
twitched convulsively, forcing him 
into a stumbling limp and he si- 
lently cursed the fate that had 
brought him to such a lowly exist- 
ance. Him! Joe Kenton! Member 
of the first expedition to land on 
Mars and successfully return to 
Earth. And what was he now? Just 
a second rate design consultant 
working in a laboratory on the 
moon. His water blue eyes clouded 
in his flood of self pity. How beauti- 
ful it had been out there ... all 
blackness, all majesty, the throb- 
bing power of the rockets, the thrill 
of unknown adventures in the void. 
His rickety old heart beat faster 
with remembering. The scorching 
desolateness of Mars was something 
he would never forget. Even now 
he could see the miles of heat- 
drenched land, the thick red pow- 
der that covered the planet’s crust, 
the stretching reaches of nothing 
but a barren, dead world. And 
then — the accident. Sure, it was 
just an accident. How could he 
know that the port lid was going 
to break its magnetic field and 
slam down upon him? It had 
though, and he had returned an 
honored man, praised for his self- 
sacrificing adventure, then pitied 
because he would spend the rest 
of his life a crippled man. He 
twisted his thin, blue-veined hands 
together, those hands that had 
piloted a glittering rocket through 

CORBOW'S' THEORY 



ace, those hands that had sifted 
rough the sands of an alien world, 
those hands that now were white 
and fragile, working over drawings 
and plans for other ships. Gone 
were the dreams, and with their go- 
ing came the bitterness. 

He felt his anger melting in his 
own self pity, decided not to brush 
away the tears that gathered in his 
eyes and turned to his board, star- 
ing at it through blurred vision. 

“Bong! End of round five. Just 
wait around a minute folks, next 
round coming up.” Vem Webber 
peered cautiously around the door 
as if expecting something to fly at 
him, then jumped into the room. 
His youthful face broke into a 
broad grin as he bowed before the 
chief designer. “Oh great and noble 
Mr. Bronsen Corbow. Is it safe for 
your lowly servant to approach 
these hallowed halls in answer to 
your summons? Mine is not to rea- 
son why — but I’d still like to leave 
here with my head on my shoul- 
ders.” 

Bronsen found himself smiling at 
his young assistant. Vem, although 
he was twenty-four, had the spirit 
and air of a teenager and usually 
succeeded in keeping the lab in a 
state of high humor. The tenseness 
of the argument with Mars dis- 
pelled itself and Bronsen relaxed. 

“Get word to the men that we 
are having a special meeting this 
afternoon, in the conference room. 
We’re going to blow the lid right 
off the present concepts of space 
travel and really give those people 
out there something that will make 
their eyes bulge. I’ll tell you more 
about it this afternoon.” 


“Aye, aye, sir!” Vem clicked his 
heels, gave an exaggerated salute 
and was gone. 

Bronsen glanced in returning an- 
noyance at the snort of disgust that 
issued from Mars’ comer. That old 
fool and his rockets, he thought 
were things of the past. There was 
only the future now. New ideas, 
new methods, new successes. Why 
couldn’t Mars see that? And yet, 
Bronsen himself felt a tiny pulsing 
of doubt. He cursed himself for 
that tinge of self -distrust, but could 
do nothing about it. He was bril- 
liant, he was a master of design 
and he knew space flight as well 
as he knew the shape, workings and 
complexities of the pencil he twirled 
in his hands. But what if he wasn’t 
right? What if his new theory was 
a flop — and with it a waste of 
money, time and human lives? 

He tore himself from his dismal 
thoughts with a savage determin- 
ation and strode into his office. 
That damned Mars was just get- 
ting under his skin, that’s all. Listen 
to him long enough and he’ll have 
you thinking we should all have 
stayed back in the horse and buggy 
days. No problems of space flight 
then, no old beliefs, ancient ideas, 
stagnant prejudices to worry about 
then. Not as far as traveling to the 
stars was concerned, anyway. 

U ¥^IRST, let’s review a few 

■T points I know you are all 
familiar with, but that you should 
keep in mind, starting with the be- 
ginning of space travel.” Bronsen 
ran his hand through his hair and 
looked over the eagerly expectant 

97 



LEE WALLOT 



faces of his staff, considering care- 
fully the points he had to make. 

“First, there were the Detoriuro- 
driven rockets. Fine ships that 
opened up the realm of travel in 
outer space.” His voice was firm, 
stringent with his inner excitement, 
his faith in his idea. “In fact, it was 
just such a ship as this' that Joe 
Kenton, Mars to you folks, was on 
when they made their first landing 
on Mars. These ships had their 
good points and still are excellent 
over short distances but certainly 
are of no use for intergalactic 
flight. They are much too slow, re- 
quiring more than a lifetime to 
make the trip there and back. 

“Then came the interstellar 
drive, the method we are now us- 
ing. This drive, utilizing Carbolium 
which we have to manufacture, 
makes full use of space as a medium 
of travel. There’s only one catch. 
We can make only a certain amount 
of Carbolium, and the costs of mak- 
ing it are astronomical. However, 
no matter what the expense, the 
supply is limited. Still, everything’s 
fine. We use the old rockets for 
short distances and the interstellar 
drive for intergalactic trips.” 

He paused a minute to let it sink 
in. “That is everything was fine. 
As you know, we have found an- 
other planet, remarkably similar 
to Earth in the Eastrex Galaxy, 
and have succeeded in setting up 
a colony there. This presents prob- 
lems. For one, since we can send 
only four ships a year to Naver, this 
new planet, our colonizing is go- 
ing to be slowed down to a crawl. 
Also, we will have a mighty hard 
time trying to get supplies and ev- 

98 


erything else that a new colony 
needs to Naver within a reason- 
able length of time. In other words, 
what we need is a ship that will be 
cheap to run, fast enough to get 
there and get back again and also 
safe enough to carry passengers and 
cargo, even in small amounts. 
You’ve heard of this problem be- 
fore; I know you’ve tried indepen- 
dently to work it out and have not 
had much luck. I think we might 
have an answer now. 

“How many of you have shot a 
rifle or are familiar with a gun?” 

The expectant faces had gone 
blank. What was he leading up to 
anyhow? Still, a large number of 
hands cautiously worked their way 
into the air. 

“All right. All you have to do 
right now is forget about space 
ships and concentrate on a rifle 
and a bullet.” There was beginning 
to be the muttering and stirring of 
a confused group of people. Bron- 
sen’s muscular hands gripped the 
table eagerly. They were confused, 
but they were also interested. “You 
are familiar with the fields and 
grooves of a gun barrel,” he con- 
tinued, “and you kpow they are 
there to give the bullet a spin when 
it is fired. Now what happens to a 
bullet when it is fired from a 
smooth barrel, with no grooves? It 
is inaccurate, wobbles, has less 
power and eventually turns end 
over end. Now, take the grooved 
rifle barrel. The bullet is given a 
spin, it has many times the velocity 
of the other, it has a straight line 
accuracy due to the spiral motion 
— keep these last two points in 
mind — and providing the rifle is 

CORBOW'S THEORY 



aimed right in the first place, will 
hit the target.” 

The group was being split up 
into two factions, those who leaned 
forward expectantly once more 
and those who shook their heads in 
bafflement. 

“Now, let’s go back again to the 
old rockets, and also our present 
ones. They all use the same prin- 
ciple to get off the ground — blast 
off with rockets. But let’s add a 
second type of blasting off area, also 
using rockets, but one that looks 
like a monstrous rifle barrel, com- 
plete to the fields and grooves. We 
have a launching apparatus that 
is like a grooved rifle compared to 
a smooth barreled one. The smooth 
barrel that we now use, the rockets 
taking off straight, gives good accel- 
eration but not enough top speed. 
Our old rockets had that fault and 
never could get good velocity even 
when in flight. Our new ones take 
over with the interstellar drive, but 
we want to eliminate this last 
method. The spiral take off though, 
would give much greater velocity 
right from the start, would enable 
the ship to hit outer space with a 
greater speed than it could attain 
using the other methods and it 
would continue on in space at a 
much faster rate. The lack of fric- 
tion would keep it from slowing 
down and if we could hit the speed 
we want before entering outer 
space, the ship could go right on 
at that same rate in space. There 
wouldn’t even be need for rocket 
power while in actual galactic 
flight. The initial momentum 
would carry it through to its des- 
tination. The rocket could do all 


this because this spiral launching 
would give us more ‘muzzle veloc- 
ity’, and in a given time after blast 
off, the spinning ship would have 
reached a much greater speed than 
the regularly fired one. This means 
operating cost will be confined to 
blast off, landing and to skirt 
around any sudden dangers that 
might arise in space.” 

“We therefore have a ship that 
has the velocity of the drive and 
maybe more, without the cost of 
drive. It has safety since our old 
rockets proved to be remarkably 
accident-free and this design would 
actually be working on almost the 
same principle as the old rockets, 
except for the blast off. The dif- 
ference in outer space would be 
this. The old ships used rockets 
throughout the trip to increase 
their velocity. The new ones will be 
traveling so fast when they enter 
outer space, they won’t have to use 
any power because they will already 
have the velocity needed.” 

He paused to swallow the dry- 
ness in his mouth and noticed with 
pleasure that more than one face 
was twisted in thought. Good. All 
they have to do is be given a theory 
to think about, the time to do that 
thinking and they’d be on their 
way. 

“That’s about it for now. I have 
some ideas of my own for the design 
of this ship . and it’s really sur- 
prising when you think how simple 
it is. But I’ll save that for some 
other time. Right now, I’d want all 
of you to think about it. It gets top 
priority. Report back to me with 
your ideas. I think we can lick this 
problem and get our bread and 

99 


LEE WALLOT 



butter, Inter Galactic Enterprises, 
right on top of the pile. Good 
luck.” 

The meeting broke up amidst 
frantic discussion, wails of misun- 
derstanding, confusion and quiet 
self-musings. Bronsen smiled to him- 
self, his face almost boyishly ra- 
diant in his pleasure. The seed had 
been planted. Now all he had to 
do was give it time to grow and 
bear fruit. 


V ERN’S cry of amazement rang 
with reverence as he stood with 
Bronsen looking over the first test 
rocket as it was slowly wheeled to 
the launching area. “Boy-o-boy! 
Look at that beauty! Did you ever 
see anything like it?” The silver 
ship lay on its side as it approached 
the huge tower, but already Vem 
could see its glistening majesty 
soaring through the sky. 

“She was a lot of work, Vem. 
Let’s just keep our fingers crossed. 
By the way, that design of yours 
on the rotating cylinder inside the 
rocket, working independently of 
the rocket’s forced spin, was good. 
Tough thing to lick, but now the 
pilot can keep a steady ‘up’ and 
‘down’ no matter how much the 
outside of the ship is spinning. Good 
work.” 

Vern shrugged his shoulders. 
“Tust call me the Einstein of the 
23rd century, that’s all. We’ll all 
see how well everything works 
pretty soon now.” 

Bronsen was finding the tension 
beginning to build up in him. Just 
a few more hours and his theory 
would be lauded with success or 


shattered into the dust. He peered 
at the rocket, at the tiny black fig- 
ures of the men that were dwarfed 
by its size and at the giant, black 
tube, towering hundreds of feet 
high, waiting patiently to receive 
her first charge. The needle-nosed 
space craft glistened in the early 
morning sun, her thin beauty tan- 
talizing to the senses of a spaceman. 
Her lines swept gracefully back 
across her smooth expanse until 
they hit the four fin tips sweeping 
out from the rotating band of the 
tail piece, the fin tips that would 
fit into the slowly spiraling grooves 
of the launching tower. The field 
and groove construction first sug- 
gested by Bronsen had been re- 
placed by lands and grooves when 
it was found that the fewer grooves 
gave greater accuracy and better 
muzzle velocity when tested on the 
laboratory models. Thus, there 
were only four fins instead of the 
originally planned eight. 

The rocket reached the lowering 
platform and Bronsen watched in 
nervous anxiety as the ship was 
lowered into the ground tail first, 
then slowly began its upward as- 
cent into the belly of the launcher. 
He thought of a thousand things 
that could happen right then, 
found that none of them were go- 
ing to and returned to his office. 
The rocket was safely nestled in the 
launcher’s belly, patiently waiting 
for the human crew to arrive and 
give it life. 

When they gathered about the 
launching field that afternoon 
Bronsen found himself sweating in 
both the heat of the day and the 
torrid intensity of Mars’ insistence 

COR BOW'S THEORY 


100 



that the whole thing was going to 
be one big flop. 

“Just one blast from those rock- 
ets and we’ll all be blown into the 
next galaxy, without benefit of a 
space ship. Trying to shoot a 70,000 
pound rocket as if it were a toy 
gun. You’ll learn one of these days, 
Gorbow, that the old way was still 
the best. It got us to Mars and back 
and if you’d work on that instead 
of this, it would be good for inter- 
galactic flight too. But no, you’ve 
got to have your name up there in 
print.” 

“Oh, shut up your damned 
mumbling, Mars!” 

Bronsen shot the words out sav- 
agely. He gave the older man a 
withering look and turned his 
attention again to the ship. The 
men that were to take her up had 
disappeared inside the expanse of 
the launching tower and the other 
figures darted back and forth, mak- 
ing last minute preparations. The 
minutes began to tick off. Five min- 
utes until blast off. Four minutes. 
Three minutes. The field was now 
completely devoid of human fig- 
ures. Two minutes. One minute. 
Ten seconds, nine, eight. The 
launcher looked lonely and terrify- 
ing in its greatness and Bronsen 
tried to wish the rocket up out of 
her belly by will power alone. Four, 
three , two, one . 

The ground trembled as the 
ear-shattering roar jumped across 
the lunar landscape. The sound 
grew louder, sharper, and Bron- 
sen began to think his head would 
split with the noise. The rockets 
pitched higher, their scream pierced 
the air and then the silver nose of 


the ship edged above the top of the 
launcher. It pulled further into 
view, the shimmering silver glint- 
ing in the sun and Bronsen 
clenched his fists in anxiety. Come 
on baby; show them what you can 
do. That’s it baby, keep right on 
coming. Come on girl! The ship 
rose clear of the launcher, the dis- 
tance making it look as if it were 
shot straight out, but Bronsen knew 
the steadily spinning hull was head- 
ing right. 

Suddenly he noticed it. Some- 
thing was wrong! The ship wasn’t 
acting right. What was it? His eyes 
tried to leap from his head to get 
closer to the rising needle and 
then he saw it. It was shaking. The 
whole ship was trembling as if in 
human terror. He watched the 
tremors pass from the nose to the 
tail, each one more violent than 
the last, until the whole ship was 
wracked with a shaking like palsy. 
Why? It had worked so beautifully 
with the experimental models. 
What was causing it? The bow of 
the ship was now visibly shaking, 
the tremors becoming more savage 
and then the nose began to dip. 
With a final shudder of resigna- 
tion, the rocket pitched over and 
began its screaming descent. Bron- 
sen watched the plunging ship, felt 
his heart grab in pain in his chest 
and stumbled back from the obser- 
vation window unable to watch any 
longer. The burst of a million shells 
at once slammed into the unyield- 
ing lunar plain. In his mind’s eye 
he could see the twisted, exploding 
mass of metal and the thought 
sickened him. 

The others ran from the room, 

101 


LEE WALLOT 



heading for the wrecked ship. Broa- 
sen watched them with dull eyes 
and made no attempt to follow. 
What could they do for the four 
men that had gone to their deaths 
in his mad creation? What could 
they do for the millions of dollars 
that now lay a twisted heap of 
rubble? He turned to drag his de- 
feated body back to the lab, to 
twist and mull in his mind what 
had happened, and found himself 
looking into the glaring eyes of 

“I told you, didn’t I, Mr. Cor- 
bow?” 

Bronsen covered his ears so that 
he wouldn’t hear. He screamed, 
“Shut up! Shut up before I slam 
you one.” 

Mars spat in disgust. “Four nice 
guys in that ship, too. Knew ’em, 
didn’t you?” 

Bronsen’s hammer-hard first 
smashed into Mars’ mouth and the 
old man was slammed against the 
wall before falling in a crumpled 
heap on the floor. He sat there, 
the blood oozing from his mouth 
as he stared at the retreating back 
of the man he never thought would 
have enough nerve to really hit 
him. Now he was sorry he had 
said anything and the self pity 
welled up within him. He really 
didn’t mean half of what he al- 
ways managed to spit out. What 
made him do it? He wiped the 
blood from his mouth and pulled 
himself to his feet. 


B RONSEN slumped further 
down into the soft contours of 
the chair, eyeing Hanson Reed with 

102 


a tortured soul. The president of 
Inter Galactic Enterprises glared at 
him from the other side of the 
desk, every inch of his paunchy 
frame the body of an outraged ex- 
ecutive. He chewed violently on the 
black cigar in his mouth and waited 
impatiently for Bronsen to explain. 
Bronsen spread his hands help- 
lessly. 

“I don’t know Reed. I just don’t 
know.” His shoulders heaved in a 
sigh of dejection. “Every single per- 
son in the moon lab has been look- 
ing for an answer and we still can’t 
find out why the ship crashed. 
We’ve tested the laboratory models 
over and over again. We’ve gone 
over every little detail and have 
nothing but a blank to show for it.” 

Reed chewed more savagely at 
the end of his cold cigar. “We spent 
two million dollars on research and 
development and all we have to 
show for it is a pile of scrap metal 
and four corpses scattered over 
the lunar landscape. There’s got to 
be some explanation.” 

“Just one in a million chances 
that an accident like this would 
happen,” Bronsen countered des- 
perately. “It’s just coincidence that 
it happened on the first model.” 

“Coincidence!” Mars’ voice was 
guttural with contempt. “I told you 
from the start it wasn’t practical. I 
knew . .” 

“All right, Mars,” Reed inter- 
rupted. “You were project design 
engineer, right?” Mars nodded in 
agreement. “Was there anything 
wrong with the design of the ship, 
any reason why it probably 
wouldn’t have worked, from a de- 
sign stand-point?” 

CORBOW'S THEORY 



“No,” he answered reluctantly. 
“Not that I could see. I just knew 
from the start it wasn’t going to 
work. I told Bronsen that, lots of 
times, but he just isn’t the type to 
take advice.” 

Bronsen roared and leaped to his 
feet. 

“You old fool,” he bellowed. 
“Technically, theoretically and me- 
chanically, there wasn’t one indi- 
cation that it wasn’t going to be a 
completely successful launching 
procedure. You know that as well 
as anyone! Ask the men around 
you. They handled the final appli- 
cation, the mechanics, the construc- 
tion, the blast off. Ask any one of 
them. Every single one of them 
will tell you the same thing. There 
was no reason why the ship should 
have crashed! Every item had 
been checked, double checked and 
re-checked again. The instruments 
indicated everything was function- 
ing perfectly at blast off. If you 
didn’t have such a twisted inverted 
opinion of everything . .” 

Mars leaned forward, his body 
now trembling, “Don’t you go call- 
ing me names, you swell-headed 
pup!” 

Reed pounded his desk violently. 

“Mars! Bronsen! he shouted im- 
patiently. “This is hardly the time 
for name-calling and airing per- 
sonal gripes. We’re here to find a 
good reason for spending more 
money on this project. We’re not 
children in a schoolyard, arguing 
over a piece of candy, although 
that’s exactly what it’s beginning to 
sound like. Frankly, I’m of the 
opinion that with so much internal 
fighting going on, nothing could 

LEE WALLOT 


possibly come of spending more. It 
would be a waste of both finances 
*nd time.” 

Bronsen slowly sat down again, 
his trembling hands clenched into 
tight fists. 

“That’s one item you don’t have 
to worry about,” he growled. “Ken- 
ton is completely finished as far as 
I’m concerned. He’s out. Fired.” 

Mars’ face fell in shocked sur- 
prise. Reed tore the cigar from his 
mouth and glared at Bronsen. 

“No one is being fired, Bronsen. 
You’ve been a good leader, in my 
opinion, as well as a friend, but I 
do the firing around here.” Bron- 
sen glowered and reddened under 
the unexpected rebuttal but said 
nothing. “You are young yet,” 
Reed continued. “You’ve got 
brains, imagination, leadership and 
ability. Wouldn’t be where you are 
if you didn’t. There’s just one 
thing lacking, and Mars is the one 
that has it. Experience. And with 
that experience goes well-used 
caution. You’ve got the go-ahead, 
but he has the wisdom. Temper- 
ance and drive. That’s Mars and 
you. You’ve got each other. Why 
don’t you just learn how to work 
with and use each other?” 

Bronsen remained in baleful si- 
lence. Mars glared at the younger 
man and sneered contemptuously. 

“That young pup never will 
know what the word caution means. 
He’s so eager to get his name 
up . .” 

Bronsen rose to his feet, his grey 
eyes flashing in hate. Reed slammed 
his cigar into the ashtray and threw 
up his hands. 

“That’s it! It’s the last straw! 

103 



I’m through playing referee for 
two snarling dogs. The project is 
closed, finished! If and when some* 
body can come up with a decent 
reason why it should be opened 
again, we’ll consider it then. Un- 
til that time, consider the project 
non-existent and return to your 
regular jobs. And cut out the 
bickering and fighting — or you are 
both fired!” 

He pulled out a fresh cigar, bit 
into it in disgust and dismissed the 
meeting by returning to the papers 
on his desk. Bronsen felt the anger 
boiling over within him and sup- 
pressed the desire to hand in his 
resignation on the spot. He looked 
for Mars and saw his thin frame 
out the door. He wearily passed a 
hand over his eyes and left the 
room. 


M ARS SCOWLED in annoy- 
ance at Vem’s whistling and 
silently wished the young assistant 
would get out of the room and let 
him brood in peace. He chewed the 
end of his pencil methodically and 
savagely, his features blushing pink 
with anger as he remembered the 
tirade of words exchanged with 
Bronsen a week ago. “Stupid, in- 
solent, day-dreaming pup,” he 
snarled half aloud. 

Vem stopped in mid-step, eye- 
ing him in surprise. “Huh?” he 
said. “Did you say something to 
me?” 

Mars grimaced. “No. I was just 
talking to myself.” 

Vem grinned widely. “That’s 
good. I’d sure hate to have any- 
body think those words were a de- 

104 


scription of me. Good old Vem, 
that’s me. Combination office boy, 
slave, master of ceremonies and 
soothing balm for ruffled egos. 
That’s my description of me. Mas- 
ter of all trades, Jack of none. Of 
course, I can’t say what others 
think.” 

“You don’t make much sense,” 
Mars growled thickly, biting again 
into the pencil. 

“Neither do you,” Vem coun- 
tered quickly. “But then again, 
what man does to a struggling 
young genius like myself?” 

“Oh dry up,” came the reply. 
“And take that drawing table into 
the new drafter’s room.” 

“Oh, sure. You only need about 
three men to move that monster 
but . .” He left the sentence un- 
finished and dragged the table from 
the wall. Mars smiled sympathet- 
ically, shook his head, and pointed 
to his bad leg when Vern indicated 
he could use some help. 

“Such is the life of a slave,” the 
younger man sighed and hoisting 
the clumsy article, headed for the 
door. 

“Look out!” Mars suddenly 
yelled and jumped forward to catch 
a falling rocket model as the table 
edge glanced off it. Vem yelped in 
surprise, jolted backward and fell 
against the wall, the heavy board 
crashing down on his foot. 

“My God, Vern. Your foot . .” 
The other grinned, withdrew his 
foot, from beneath the board and 
pulled down his sock. “Not this 
baby,” he flipped. “I’ve got cast- 
iron insurance. It’s plastic from the 
ankle down, see?” 

Mars stared in shock at the arti- 


CORBOW'S THEORY 



ficial limb and could think of noth- 
ing very brilliant to say. 

“Got it in cadet school,” Vein 
explained and then answered the 
question in Mars’ eyes. “I was 
training to be a space pilot myself. 
Some fellows and I decided to cele- 
brate our graduation, got drunk 
and ended up in a wreck. They put 
me together real good, even taught 
me how to use the foot so no one 
would ever know it wasn’t the real 
thing. It washed me out as far as 
the Space Corps was concerned 
though. I drowned my sorrows in 
alcohol for a couple weeks, told my- 
self I was going to hell with myself 
and then decided to put what I did 
know to work. That’s how I joined 
up with this outfit. Now I sit back 
and design the rockets my class- 
mates have to worry about flying 
. Enough of this chatter . got 
to get busy. See you.” 

Mars turned thoughtfully back 
to his desk. “That kid’s got only 
one foot,” he mused soberly. He 
looked down at his own injured leg 
and savagely kicked it against the 
wall. 

“Your leg. Your poor, crippled 
leg . what a fine crutch it has 
been,” he bitterly reproached him- 
self. “It proves you were one of the 
first in space, and you won’t let 
people forget it. You’re a jealous 
old man. You’re afraid to have 
someone else do what you no longer 
can do. You want things to stay the 
way they were when you got hurt, 
so no one else can live your dream. 
If time stood still, there would be 
no trips to new planets, no new dis- 
coveries and Mars Kenton would 
still be the hero of his dream.” 


He tried to revolt, to denounce 
the self-accusations. “What about 
Bronsen Corbow?” he asked. “Does 
that explain why I’ve fought him 
so hard?” 

His slowly growing conscience 
laughed at him. “But it does. Bron- 
sen ignores your crutch, your proof 
that the old way worked the best. 
He’s concerned with the future, the 
future you never want to come.” 
He buried his grey-thatched head 
in his hands and felt the weariness 
in his bones. His thoughts returned 
to the unsuccessful launching. 

“But it was a crazy idea,” he 
argued weakly. “It would never 
have worked anyway.” It was a 
poor defense, one that faltered and 
failed when he finally admitted the 
truth : He was a jealous, bitter 
man, fighting anonymity. 

Once more he found himself 
mulling over the rocket launching, 
probing for support to his initial de- 
cision that it wouldn’t work, search- 
ing for some point to substantiate 
his claim. But was he really right 
in that decision? Had he let his 
hate-ridden heart rule his reason- 
ing mind? He waded back to the 
beginning of Bronsen’s theory. Bul- 
lets . the test models were the 
bullets. Shells . the huge rocket 
itself was a shell compared to the 
bullets. Shells have an ojive, bour- 
relet, rotating band, but bullets are 
different. How? He stopped. He re- 
viewed the parts in his mind, then 
suddenly lurched to the files and 
pu’led out the rocket plans. He 
compared the ship’s construction 
bit by bit with a shell, his mind 
working quickly, accurately, with a 
new enthusiasm.

Hours later he leaned back from 
his drawing table and his voice 
rumbled out into the quiet reaches 
of the empty room. 

“Men will fly to the stars like a 
bullet,” he prophesized. “Because I 
know why the rocket crashed.” 

It was dark but the light in Bron- 
sen’s office was still on. Mars pulled 
himself erect and turned toward 
Bronsen’s room, then faltered. “I 
could just forget it,” he mused. 
“Then the idea would be filed 
away. But someday . .” He could 
not do it. The excitement was be- 
ginning to mount inside of him, 
pushing him forward. He took a 
deep breath and with a decisive 
shrug drew back his shoulders, 
standing straighter and taller than 
he had in fifteen long years. He 
strode from the room and headed 
down the hall. 

Bronsen heard the door behind 
him open and close softly. He 
glanced up and saw who it was and 
returned, scowling, to his work. 
When Mars did not leave, he 
looked up again, curiosity stirring 
within him at the expression in the 
older man’s face. 

“Well?” 

It wasn’t really a question, nor 
an inflection denoting that he 
wanted to hear what Mars had to 
say. It was more of a compromise 
between physically throwing him 
out and grudgingly listening to 
what he had to say. 

“I’ve got it, I know what hap- 
pened to the ship,” Mars an- 
nounced quietly. “I knew it when I 
saw it come out of the launcher but 
I couldn’t explain it.” Bronsen re- 
turned to his papers with a snort 

106 


and Mars pleaded, “I’m sorry 
about all those things I said. For 
God’s sake. Listen to me!” 

The tortured pleading in the 
man’s voice made Bronsen put 
down the papers in surprise. 

“The models worked,” Mars 
plunged ahead. “Sure they did. But 
because they were small ... so 
much smaller than the real ship . 
there was no trouble and they 
worked perfectly. The trouble re- 
veals itself only as the projectile 
gets larger. The nose, Bronsen. A 
nose band. Don’t you see what I’m 
trying to say?” 

The younger man stared in si- 
lence at the pleading ex-space pilot, 
before the words began to penetrate 
his whirling thoughts. He forgot the 
crash of the ship; he forgot the feel 
of hard teeth splitting the skin 
across his knuckles; he forgot the 
animosity that existed between 
them. His mind could focus on 
nothing but what Mars was trying 
to say. 

“The nose of the ship is long. 
The only guides were on the tail 
at the rotating band. Think of 
shells. Bourrelets. The big shells 
have bourrelets . bands around 
the nose that dig into the grooves 
and steady the front of the shell. 
The ship ... its front began trem- 
bling because there was nothing to 
guide the nose in a steady path. 
The more velocity the rocket had, 
the worse the trembling became 
until it threw the whole ship out of 
control. Don’t you see? That’s all 
that was wrong with it! It would 
have been perfect if it had had 
guide wings on the bourrelet. The 
guide pieces could be withdrawn 

CORBOW'S THEORY 



when the ship is launched . but 
they would have to be there in or- 
der to get it launched. I’m right, 
you know I am! That’s your an- 
swer. That was the only part wrong 
with it!” 

The enormity of Mars’ words left 
Bronsen speechless. He looked at 
the suddenly joyous man before 
him and saw the old bitterness re- 
placed by the rapture of his dis- 
covery. Yes, that was what had 
been wrong. It was the solution . 
the one tiny piece that made the 
puzzle into an understandable pic- 
ture. He paused a moment, as if 
trying to make a great decision, 
then grabbed the older man by the 
arm. 

“Come on! Let’s get it down on 
paper!” 


T HE ROCKET lay huddled in 
the belly of the launching 
tower, her needle-like body quiet, 
waiting, her control panels flashing 
signals and instructions to her mas- 
ters, her circuits buzzing with the 
tenseness of the seconds before blast 
off. The steady counting drummed 
through her wires, tripped relays, 
and her masters flipped the 
switches, pressed the buttons and 
pulled the levers that readied her 
for her maiden flight. Eight sec- 
onds, seven seconds. Six seconds, 
five, four. The switch was jerked 
upward and she felt the power be- 
ginning to move in her vitals. 
Three, two, one! 

The driver button slammed 
home, her rockets roared out in 
ferocious birth, snarling, roaring, 
growing with each passing second. 

LEE WALLOT 


She settled back upon her rockets 
as if in protest at their screaming 
growth, then was forced to give 
ground and the ship moved up the 
shaft. Her rotating band and bour- 
relet fins dug deep into the spiral- 
ing grooves, her body began to turn 
. slowly, so slowly. Then she sud- 
denly leaped forward, her hull 
whirling upward; the shaft raced 
by in dizzy swiftness, her rockets 
roared louder and she raised her 
spinning body further. She was 
free! Her body hurtled up and up, 
her needle nose straight and true, 
her velocity leaping forward. 

“Off rockets! Set up emergency 
interstellar drive for instant activa- 
tion if needed. Signal in scanning 
screens. Activate force field and 
take a breather boys. We’re on our 
way and the blast off was perfect.” 

The pilot’s mechanical sounding 
voice droned through the speaker 
in the moon-bound observation 
room and simultaneously the air 
was ruffled by the deep exhale of 
relief, the rustle of slowly relaxing 
bodies strung tight with the hopeful 
tenseness of the blast off. 

Mars gazed up at the disappear- 
ing silver streak, his blue eyes in- 
tent, glistening with pride and ex- 
citement. “I never thought I’d see 
the day,” he breathed. “Look at 
her, she’s going straight and true. 
She’s the most beautiful thing I 
ever saw.” 

Bronsen’ s face relaxed into a 
happy grin as the gleaming rocket 
hurtled up out of sight. He glanced 
at Mars and gave him a compan- 
ionable smile. 

“Even more beautiful than Mars

The invaders were going to make galactic history. 


Fate made it a comedy of errors. 









BY RICHARD BOLTON 


URG THWIRMED, and ad- 
mitted to himself that he was 
uneasy. Arching his thorax, he un- 
rolled his antennae slowly in a lazy 
gesture he hoped would conceal the 
unseemly nervousness he felt now 
that the ship had swung into an 
orbit around the strange planet. 
When a commander briefs his of- 
ficers, he must radiate confidence 
and calm. 

“Companions, an historic mo- 
ment has arrived , 55 he began pomp- 
ously, his antennae moving in the 
deliberate, stylized movements of 
the Court language. “Below us lies 
the verdant expanse of the third 
planet, green gem of the heavens . 55 

At this, several of his subordi- 


nates turned a rather puzzled yel- 
low around their head orifices, 
obviously unable to understand a 
gesture of what he was saying. Only 
the second-in-command seemed un- 
concerned; he knew from long ex- 
perience that his commander would 
revert to common vernacular when 
he had finished the usual cere- 
monial preamble. 

Zurg did so, noting the relieved 
hues of his officers as he continued : 
“As you all know, our scouts have 
reconnoitered this world on several 
occasions. But now the time has ar- 
rived to make an actual landing. In 
fact, companions, we are the van- 
guard of an invasion . 55 Pausing to 
let this register, he was pleased to 



108 







see that none of the officers seemed 
to be suppressing thwirms. If any- , 
thing, they were calmer than he 
was. 

“Not a great deal is known about 
the inhabitants of the planet, but 
the dominant form of life, strangely 
enough, is mammalian, and pos- 
sesses some intelligence. Her Ma- 
jesty desires conquest without un- 
due destruction. As the Queen 
wills, her servants shall act.” 

All dipped their antennae at this 
formula, and watched in attentive 
hues as the commander went on to 
explain that due to the high per- 
centage of oxygen in the atmos- 
phere, special coverings would have 
to be worn. They would filter the 
air before it reached the ventral 
tracheae, and leaving the head ex- 
posed, would shield all the rest of 
the body. A bit clumsy, the com- 
mander admitted, but absolutely 
essential. 

“Now as to our behavior toward 
the natives — previous experience 
with mammalian life-types shows 
that they are susceptible to panic 
and fear when confronted with 
something totally strange, so we will 
use tactics which basically are very 
simple. First, we will land near a 
native settlement. When we march 
into the area, our alien appearance 
will stun the natives. Our detach- 
ment of all-range telepathic sensi- 
tives will notify us when the state 
of shock has set in, then our attack 
support will open up with full-scale 
mental assault, and keep the crea- 
tures paralyzed while we seize the 
area before a defense can be or- 
ganized. Then the Grand Fleet will 
proceed here at top speed.” 


“Remember that in this, as in all 
operations where the powers of the 
collective mind are used, we must 
first trigger the enemy’s reaction by 
physical means, therefore nothing 
can be done until we know that 
they are in the needed state of 
shock. Now are there any ques- 
tions?” 

How strange actually, mused the 
commander as he returned to his 
cubicle, that a race like his own, so 
gifted at pure mental contact with 
other life-forms, should still use sig- 
nals and colorations to communi- 
cate among themselves. The chafed 
spot on his left antenna was paining 
again after the exercise of the brie£ 
ing. The report had said that these 
mammalians were believed to con- 
verse through some kind of atmos- 
pheric vibrations . Odd too, that 
mental warfare, refined and devel- 
oped though it was, could still only 
be used against minds agitated by a 
specific physical stimulus. And that 
physical stimulus had to be pro- 
vided by the invaders appearing on 
the scene, and if necessary perform- 
ing the Dra, a series of dances and 
contortions so repulsive to most life- 
forms that all thinking would fade 
into panic. Having once thwirmed 
himself at a performance of the 
Dra, he hoped it wouldn’t be nec- 
essary ... his musings were inter- 
rupted as the ship’s lights flickered 
to orange, signalling hands to sta- 
tions for planetfall. 

Leaving the con of the ship to his 
second-in-command, he shut him- 
self in his cubicle and made prepa- 
rations to be miserably sick, as he 
always was during deceleration. 
Stroking the chafed spot on his an- 


109 



tenna with the smooth edge of his 
left forearm’s prehensile claw, Zurg 
raised his medicine kit in his sec- 
ondary tentacles and snapped off 
the heavy lead seal with his jagged 
incisor mandibles. I wonder, he 
speculated, why alien races always 
find us so frightening . 

The brilliant orange sun was 
high in the sky, but only a few fil- 
tered beams penetrated to the shel- 
tered copse where the slate-colored 
ship lay partially concealed by art- 
fully placed vines and underbrush. 
Drawn up in three ranks beside the 
ship, only their heads protruding 
from the loose-fitting coveralls, 
stood the detail picked to make the 
entry into the native settlement. 
Zurg led them out through the un- 
derbrush barrier they had thrown 
up the night before, and they 
emerged onto a little-traveled dirt 
road leading off across the fields to- 
ward a cluster of buildings that 
marked the edge of town. 

No creatures appeared as the in- 
vading column lumbered along. As 
they neared the edge of the settle- 
ment, Zurg, his antennae drooping 
slightly from the unusual heat, 
turned to remind the others: “Re- 
member, the mental assault won’t 
begin until we are well into the 
area and shock reaction is effected, 
so stay in formation until I order 
otherwise.” 

There were still no natives in 
sight on the small side street by 
which they entered town; but as 
they turned a corner and swung on 
to the broad central thoroughfare, 
the commander saw that the street 
was clogged with natives, a great 


milling mass of them moving up 
the street in the same direction as 
his column, about a hundred yards 
ahead. 

For a moment they didn’t appear 
to notice the newcomers, but soon a 
growing number had turned and 
were gesturing excitedly to each 
other, pointing at the approaching 
troop. Watching them anxiously, 
Zurg saw no evidence of panic. 

The column kept moving, and 
the crowd began parting to let 
them pass through. Some darted 
forward as though to get a closer 
look at the strangers. The com- 
mander fought off a thwirm as he 
realized the crowd was now all 
around them, pressing in more 
closely on every side. The atmos- 
phere itself seemed to vibrate 
strangely, and looking around, he 
saw that the creatures were open- 
ing small head orifices and striking 
the ends of their forward limbs to- 
gether. Were they communicating 
— or was it something else? It was 
surely not panic. 

Feeling increasingly dizzy from 
the heat and vibrations, he glanced 
anxiously over his followers, and 
saw at once that they were more 
upset than he. Colors were flushing 
their faces in meaningless succes- 
sions. One or two seemed to be 
staggering. The shock threshold of 
these beings has been horribly un- 
derestimated, thought Zurg desper- 
ately. Only one thing left to do — 
turning again, he signalled the de- 
tail to begin the Dra. Perhaps that 
would overcome this incomprehen* 
sible counterattack . 

“I tell you Charlie, you’ve got to 


110 



discipline that gang! They didn’t 
show up on time, they didn’t com- 
plete the route, they put on a public 
ritual that wasn’t scheduled, appar- 
ently stealing the entire show — 
stupid crowd yelled themselves 
hoarse. Then they all reeled off into 
a side street. They must have been 
drunk to a man — I understand 
about half of them had to be car- 
ried! And when I confronted Andy 
Sharpe, he swore up and down that 
they weren’t out of their hotel that 
morning. All sleeping off that spree 
they had the night before. He ac- 
tually had the nerve to say, 4 1 don’t 
know who those boys were that you 
claim were a block behind the end 
of the parade, but they weren’t our 
boys.’ ” 

Charlie Dils, new Commander of 
the Illinois chapter of the American 
Legion, leaned back in his chair car 
seat and blew a cloud of cigar 
smoke toward the ceiling. “Maybe 
they were men from Mars,” he 
grinned. Then, remembering his 
dignity, he sobered abruptly. “Any- 
way, one bunch looks about the 
same as another, once they get their 
masks on — good Lord, it was a hot 
day for masks — but it certainly 
made the parade more impressive. 
People are still talking about it. 
We’re even getting credit for hav- 
ing a flying saucer. Some farmer 
out at the edge of town claims he 
saw one take off after the parade 
last night. Says it was going west 
like a bat out of hell. 

“If we can get that kind of pub- 
licity, Frank, I wouldn’t worry 
about Andy and the boys. I’ll write 
him a letter. It was a great conven- 
tion — let’s let it go at that.” • • •

that day? Or the old rockets?” 

Mars looked slightly embarrassed 
and shuffled his legs into a more 
comfortable position. “Aw hell,” he 
said awkwardly. “Can’t you forget 
an old fool’s ramblings? We just 
watched a rocket launched that’s 
going to open up a whole new era 
in space travel. It was a perfect 
blast off and we know it’ll be a per- 
fect trip and landing. 

Bronsen thoughtfully nodded his 
head, his grey eyes dancing. 

“Tell you what,” Mars con- 
tinued. “I’ve got a bottle that I’ve 
been saving for about fifteen years. 
Got it when we got back from that 
first trip and never opened it. 

Bronsen grinned and gave the 
old man’s thin shoulder a hearty 
slap. 

“Let’s get that drink!” • • •

THE HAPPY HERD 

( Continued from page 27 ) 

The Staff will be after me” 

Kane glanced at the elevator, 
then they ran back toward the 
saucer. 

“You’ll have to pilot this thing,” 
Kane said. “It’s a little crowded 
up there for me.” 

She started the motor and the 
saucer lifted abruptly. “The termi- 
nal at La Guardia?” she said. 

“No. The ship’s at least two miles 
from the Terminal. We’ll go di- 
rectly to the ship.” He hesitated. 
“The only thing is — it isn’t due to 
blast out of here until the 25th.” 
“That doesn’t matter,” she said. 
“Why doesn’t it? We’re flaunting 
the law. They’re after us. They 
won’t let us just hide away on that 
ship until the 25th.” 

“They?” 

He stared at her. “You said your- 
self we had to hurry, because the 
Staff—” 

“But don’t you see, there’s no 
one to stop us now. The Staff at 
Sunny Hills could have, but here 
there isn’t any Staff. There’s none 
at the ship either, is there?” 

“No.” 

“Well then, we’ll just wait on the 
ship until — we go to the Moon.” 
“But you were afraid, Lucie. 
You talked about undergrounds, 
and how it was impossible — ” 

She touched his arm and then 
took hold of his hand. “You don’t 
understand I guess. Maybe you 
never will.” 

“Understand what?” 

“What it is to try to get away, 
be alone, be by yourself, when you 


can’t. When no matter what you do 
you’re with the Group, night and 
day, even in your dreams. You 
knew it for a while, but imagine it 
for years, not days. There’s no 
place to hide. Wherever you go 
the Group goes with you. That’s 
why I said you couldn’t get 
away — ” 

“Then there isn’t any law to pre- 
vent us from going to the Moon?” 

“Only the law of the majority, of 
Public Opinion,” she said. “But you 
can’t stay here and fight it, not for 
very long. Finally you have to give 
in to it. You become what they 
are or go mad. And there are 
Groups even for them.” 

The saucer dropped down to the 
fog draped earth and they were 
walking toward the pits where the 
Moonship waited. 

It looked like such a wonderful 
world, he thought. Everyone happy, 
everyone smiling all the time. No 
wars. No externalized authority. 

The Manufacturers of consent. A 
quasi-totalitarian society in which 
means of communication had large- 
ly replaced force as the apparatus of 
compulsion. Communication, fear, 
insecurity. In his isolation and in- 
security, man clung to his Group, 
to the majority, the accepted 
opinions. 

The majority did not need to 
force a man now. No need for 
police, or armies. 

They convinced him. 

The only way you could keep 
from being convinced was to get 
out. 

The hatch slid open. 

“Welcome aboard,” the Captain 
said. • • •

Cities may soon give up trying to 
control traffic by lights and other 
conventional means and turn to di- 
recting individual automobiles as 
traffic congestion mounts. Such in- 
dividual directing may be done, for 
example, by directly controlling the 
movements of each car, or by a 
broadcast that informs every driver 
of traffic conditions for blocks 
around him. Before this happens, 
engineers expect to use electronic 
brains in all major cities to solve 
complex traffic snarls. Each large 
city will have its own digital com- 
puter and a team of operators who 
will be able to work out the best 
method of control — through use of 
mathematical models — without dis- 
rupting actual traffic flow. 

Tomorrow's atomic airliners will be 
locomotives of the sky, according to 
a recent report delivered to the So- 
ciety of Automotive engineers. The 
“engine” will be a giant atomic- 
powered fuel-plane. The coaches 
will be smaller ships coupled to the 
locomotive in mid-air. The air- 
borne nuclear train would fly its 
course, with commercial airliners 
“unhooking” on arrival at their ter- 
minal airport, where other pas- 
senger aircraft would “latch on” for 


new airports of call. With such a 
set-up, indefinite shuttle service 
could be maintained, limited only 
by the crew’s endurance. Airlines 
and freighters, thus relieved of 
carrying full fuel loads, could haul 
larger passenger and pay loads. The 
tow plane concept also eliminates 
the problem of shielding passengers 
and cargo from radiation emitted 
by a nuclear engine. 

The day is coming when children 
will drink milk shakes or swallow 
capsules of live polio virus safely 
and get protection against the dis- 
ease. Tests with 225 non-immune 
persons have shown that all devel- 
oped antibodies against the disease. 
None has gotten polio or suffered 
any ill-effects that could be laid to 
swallowing the viruses. Capsules are 
considered the best way to give the 
live virus for vaccination. With 
these, the mouth and throat are by- 
passed so that only the lower end of 
the digestive tract can be a source 
of contagion. Simple personal hy- 
giene may completely prevent the 
transmission of the viruses from 
this source. 

"The telephone is singing” may 
outmode the familiar phrase “the 
telephone is ringing.” The new 
transistorized device installed in ex- 
perimental phones sounds like an 
oboe or clarinet giving forth a string 
of staccato notes of the same pitch. 
The tone can be varied in pitch to 
signal party-line customers or 
please private line customers. The 
range is from A sharp above middle 
C to two C’s above middle C. Ex- 
periments have shown that the 

3 



musical tone can be heard over 
much greater distances than the 
regular bell, and can also be dis- 
tinguished from doorbells, alarm 
clocks and fire alarms. Another ad- 
vantage is that it is an aid to the 
hard of hearing because it employs 
more energy in the middle fre- 
quency range, where hearing is 
most often impaired. 

The overage man 1,000,000 years 
from now will probably have a cof- 
fee colored skin, straight or slightly 
wavy black hair, dark eyes and will 
be about the same height he is now. 
And, according to a professor of zo- 
ology at the University of Cincin- 
nati, in 1,000,000,000 years man 
will still be recognizable as human; 
although slow evolutionary trends 
will have given him an almost com- 
plete physical change. People of 
that time will have larger brains, 
more intelligence, larger heads, 
smaller jaws, fewer teeth, a lower 
rate of development and a longer 
life. A person living then will prob- 
ably not have to worry about such 
things as appendicitis or tonsilitis, 
because appendix and tonsils will 
cease to exist. 

Interplanetary missiles zooming 
around Venus and Mars and land- 
ing on the moon are already being 
planned by leading rocket engineers 
and scientists. At a recent sym- 
posium on the earth satellites, plans 
were made for a three stage rocket 
weighing a million pounds which 
would be needed to place 50 
pounds of scientific instruments on 
the moon. Remote control would 
be used to land the satellite, and 

114 


television would provide the where- 
withal to study lunar conditions. 

Spring flower festivals may soon 
take place on schedule, despite cold 
seasons. Experiments controlling 
the time of budding by chemical 
methods have had wide success. 
Horticulturists now can delay the 
fall of cherry blossoms by spraying 
them with a solution of naphthalene 
acetic acid when the first petals are 
out. The treatment keeps the blos- 
soms on the trees one week longer 
than would be expected. The same 
solution is also used to delay the 
drop of fruit from the trees at har- 
vest time. On the other hand, if the 
chemical is sprayed on fruit trees 
earlier in the season, it will cause 
the fruit to drop early. 

In seeking ways to trap solar energy 
to power our mechanical civiliza- 
tion, the world may again see great 
population shifts similar to those 
that occurred as mankind settled in 
one new area after another. With 
the ingenuity already developed by 
experience in building machines to 
use fossil fuels, and whetted by re- 
cent application of nuclear energy 
to producing useful power, man- 
kind will probably solve problems 
inherent in use of solar energy be- 
fore our heritage of fossil fuels run 
out. As soon as sunshine-using de- 
vices become at all practical, an- 
cient semi-tropical river valleys, 
where civilization first began, will 
probably see a new spurt of immi- 
gration by gadget-minded people. 

A chemical rain repellent that elinu 
inates mechanical windshield wip- 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



ers will soon be on the market. De- 
signed for high speed aircraft the 
repellent is made of silicones and a 
combination of natural and syn- 
thetic waxes. The chemical rain 
protector sets up a hard coating on 
the window pane that makes rain 
roll off like heavy beads of mercury. 

Spacemen may someday find that 
the clouds astronomers observe on 
Mars are formed by volcanoes. A 
new theory recently advanced also 
suggests that the dark areas we 
know as canals may be drifts of vol- 
canic ash resulting from fall-out in 
the pattern of the prevailing mar- 
tian winds. Discovery that, on two 
occasions 13 years apart, clouds ap- 
peared in the same regions means 
they must have been produced 
mechanically or at least on a fixed 
location on the planet’s surface. 

Mushrooms may soon become part 
of the staple diet, one which doesn’t 
impinge on Man’s natural re- 
sources. Scientists have found a way 
to grow the fungus in sawdust so 
that they can become a year round 
crop. Using a ton of sawdust with 
a small amount of oatmeal re- 
searchers were able to grow 500 
pounds of mushrooms in two weeks. 
This sawdust grown crop is also im- 
portant because the mushrooms so 
produced can be grown at room 
temperatures. This means the elim- 
ination of seasonal crops and spe- 
cial caves or vaults for mushroom 
growing.

will soon be completed. The chain 
of 21 radar installations on eight 
islands have an accuracy within 
two hundredths of a degree. They 
lock on a missile the instant it is

sition, course, velocity and accelera-

People may someday be lining up 
for TB shots much as they now do 
for smallpox, polio, etc. Research- 
ers have come up with a new vac- 
cine which is excellent protection 
in mice, and uses non-living par- 
ticles of tuberculosis germs, rather 
than live germ vaccine. In this 
method, billions of bacilli are 
ground up in solution and then 
spun in a centrifuge to separate and 
remove the larger particles. 

Dentists may soon be able to trans- 
plant teeth the way cornea trans- 
plants are done now. Recent ad- 
vances in dental surgery of this type 
have shown that, after several 
years, such a transplanted tooth 
grows to full size, roots lengthen 
properly and the tooth lines up with 
surrounding teeth. The transplant 
also shows a response to heat and 
cold, similar to that of other teeth 
in the patient’s mouth. 

If test trials work out properly, 
diabetics may soon be taking pills 
instead of insulin injections The 
pills, derived from a sulfa drug, 
show a significantly high response 
when used in certain cases, ranging 
from a return to normal to a 50% 
reduction in insulin requirements.

Captain Powers shouting frantical-

no answer. It was just after sunset, 
and Biggs was looking into the 
west. 

“We ought to see it now, but it 
ain’t there,” commented Biggs. 

“What ain’t there?” demanded 
Golden. 

“Mercury,” said Biggs, who 
prided himself on being an ama- 
teur astronomer. “I reckon you 
can’t see it from Mars without a 
telescope. Too close to the sun.” 

He chuckled. 

“If there are any Martians,” he 
added, “I reckon they think they

so complicated that we’ll never 
have a complete science of it. All 
we’ll ever be able to do mathe- 
matically is predict and guide the 
broad trends. But those trends are 
made up of millions of little in- 
dividual people and incidents. To 
pervert an old saying, in govern- 
ment it is necessary to be able to 
see the trees for the forest. It takes 
an artist to know how and when to 
use the equations, and how to sup- 
plement them with his own intui- 
tive common sense. It takes not 
only a technician, but a poet to 
write a report which will really let 
me know what’s going on.” 

He raised his eyes again and said 
mildly: “It’s not your fault that 
you are neither an artist nor a poet. 
I take it you wish to remain in the 
Service?” 

“Yes, sir.” Randos was not a 
quitter. 

“Very well. I’m assigning you to 
a chief technicianship in my own 
evaluation center. Consider it a 
promotion, a reward for honest 
effort ... at least, it’s a higher rank 
and salary. You may go.” 

Kri thought he heard a gasp of 
relief, but returned to his papers. 

One might as well face it, you 
can’t kick a favorite nephew any- 
where but upstairs. The fellow 
might even make a good technical 
boss.

it. If not, well, it was only one

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I have just finished reading the 
June issue of Hue and Cry, and 
my sense of fair play compels me 
to express my surprise at the readi- 
ness of people to condemn or cen- 
sure. I am referring to Stuart An- 
derson’s letter complaining about 
an error in “ Avoidance Situation”. 
According to his argument, the 
velocity c 2 assumes various values 
depending on the original units 
used in stating the value of c. He 
uses a lot of large figures in his 
“proof” involving many powers of 
ten. All that he has succeeded in 
doing is confusing himself and hide 
the basic fallacy of his argument. 
The proof that he’s wrong lies in 
the mathematical fact that equals 
remain equals as long as the same 
factors are applied to each. 

Let us select a foot as common 
measurement, and we shall define a 


foot as a certain fraction of a light- 
second so that any measurement 
system can be converted to feet. 
Thus a square yard per second be- 
comes 9 feet per second as a nu- 
merical value only . Now bring on 
your metric or Chinese units or 
Martian units or any other meas- 
urement of velocity. Reduce the 
measurement to Terran feet per 
Terran second and then square the 
numerical value only to obtain a 
numerical value for velocity 
squared.

Dear Sir : 

Letter writing is not my habit, 
but in the June issue of Hue and 
Cry one of your correspondents 
“goofed” in his letter concerning 
the math in “Avoidance Situation”. 
Neglecting that a velocity in excess 
of c cannot be obtained we can 
write c 2 ~9 x 10 20 cm 2 /sec 2 and 
consider only the magnitude of the 
number. The writer of the letter 
published in June went on to state 
that the value of c 2 depends on the 
units used — I say he should read a 
text on elementary mathematics be- 
fore he makes such a statement. 

He states c 2 cgs. does not equal 
c 2 fps, but he forgot to convert 
properly. He said, and I quote in 
part: “c=3 x 10 10 cm/sec, c 2 = 
9 x 10 20 cm/sec; for c= 1.86 x 10 5 
miles/sec, c 2 — 3.46 x 10 10 miles/ 
sec, which is the same as 5 57 x 10 15 
cm/sec.” 

Now I say, and I will spell it out : 
c=3 x 10 10 cm/sec, c 2 =9 x 10 20 
cm 2 /sec 2 c= 1.86 x 10 6 miles/sec, 
c 2 *#^ x 10 10 miles 2 /sec 2 and 


117 


since 1 mile 2 / sec 2 *** ( 5280 

X 12 X 2.54 4^) 7 sec 2 3.46 x 
Ft. in 

10 10 x (5280 x 12 x 2.54) 2 =9 x 
10 20 cm 2 / sec 2 , and the value of c 
does not depend on units here or 
elsewhere. Units are not arbitrary, 
but chosen for convenience. I was 
shocked to say the least.

Dear Sir: 

Mr. Ryder’s letter in Hue and 
Cry in June’s IF has caused me to 
break a record of ten years of avid 
reading of s-f, and finally write a 
“fan letter”. 

In his short but excellent letter 
Mr. Ryder has, I feel, only briefly 
touched the “liberal arts approach” 
to science, and the exceeding blind- 
ness of an attitude which persistent- 
ly condemns the scientist as a cold- 
minded materialist. One cannot 
help feeling that this attitude often 
stems from a guilty awareness of ig- 
norance of those vital factors which 
have done so much to safeguard 
health, sanity and the well-being of 
people everywhere. While philoso- 
phers and Mr. Ryder’s “men of 
affairs” have been sitting on their 
hands, cold-blooded scientists have 
been easing the pain of childbirth, 
the ravages of diseases, and com- 
mitting sundry other “materialistic” 
acts. But then, these activities have 
not the sanction of being com- 
manded by the authorities, and are 
therefore not as officially represent- 
ative as bomb making. 

In my own field of music, the 

118 


Middle Ages lives on very strongly, 
and the attitude of the academic 
musicians toward the scientist per- 
haps represents the “liberal arts” 
approach par excellence . Having 
struggled with this fuzzy attitude 
for the larger part of my career (I 
am now finishing work toward a 
Doctorate of Musical Arts in Com- 
position), I am in full sympathy 
with Mr. Ryder’s letter, and only 
wish that there were more that I 
could say to emphasize this strange 
dichotomy of reason vs. logic which 
seems to characterize our general 
contemporary attitudes toward sci- 
ence and the scientists.

Dear Mr. Quinn : 

Herewith another letter from a 
reader who hasn’t missed an issue. 
Having read them all for more 
years than I care to think about, I 
give it as my opinion that you have 
now reached the top. And you go 
bi-monthly. With something over 
1,000,000 potential readers in the 
country, the inescapable conclusion 
is reached that only a very few of 
us have imagination after all. How 
many people, do you suppose, have 
the curiosity to be s-f readers? 
Woefully few, I am sure. 

I particularly like Hue and Cry 
and the letters you choose to print 
Mr. Ryder has a good point. He 
seems to be one of the few people 
who realize that scientists don’t al- 
ways strive to produce something 
with an end result' in view. They 
are merely seeking knowledge for 
its own sake. 

I offer a point of my own which 

HUE AND CRY 



has been covered in stories, but 
never to my knowledge, has been 
discussed seriously. About the origin 
of Man. It seems to me that the 
evolution of Man is based on some 
very scanty and flimsy evidence. In 
fact we have more such evidence 
for the cockroach, unchanged in 
form for the past 200,000,000 years. 
I have two questions: One is that 
if we have evolved physically, why 
hasn’t something been found rea- 
sonably close to our present physical 
shape? The second concerns our 
language. Probably the oldest lan- 
guage on Earth is Sanskrit. Have 
you ever examined it? It is tre- 
mendously complex. Could such a 
language have sprung in one leap 
from creatures who communicated 
by grunts? If not, surely at some 
time in that period when it was de- 
veloping, somebody should have 
chiseled a few words on a rock here 
and there and preserved the rock 
for us. Older things have been dug 
up. The evidence seems to be that 
Man appeared on earth with some 
sort of language and civilization all 
at once, and not too long ago, 
geologically at that. Further, the 
oldest extant writings do not show 
any less intelligence than is present- 
ly current. In that case shouldn’t 
there be some remains of these peo- 
ple as intelligent as we are, in the 
form of artifacts, or some alteration 
on the face of the earth? There are 
many questions on this subject still 
to be answered, but they won’t be if 
we close our minds to everything 
but the Evolutionary Theory.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I am one of many ardent fans of 
good SF short stories and enjoy 
reading If which in my opinion is 
one of the best magazines in the 
country today. I personally think 
the departments add flavor and 
variety. So naturally I was over- 
whelmed to see that the June issue 
boasted an article on the Vanguard 
Satellite and several beautiful illus- 
trations by Mel Hunter. But I have 
a bone to pick with the authors. 

I think the article was well writ- 
ten, but the source of the author’s 
information seems to leave a lot to 
be desired. Quote: “We feel that 
the basketball nomenclature was an 
unfortunate choice”. The follow- 
ing, in my opinion, proves the 
authors know how to read. 

The general announcement of 
the Vanguard Project came on July 
29, 1955 when the plan was re- 
vealed to the press by James Hag- 
erty, Press Secretary, Detlew Bronk, 
President of the National Academy 
of Sciences and Alan Waterman, 
director of the National Science 
Foundation. The official statement 
read, “Plans for the construction of 
a small, unmanned earth circling 
satellite vehicle to be used for basic 
scientific observations during the 
forthcoming International Geo- 
physical year were announced on 
July 30”. In the original announce- 
ment no description of the satellite 
was given with the exception of 
small and unmanned. Yet the next 
day the papers carried accounts of 
a basketball shaped satellite. To my 
knowledge the press accounts were 
of an unmanned satellite designed 
by S. Fred Singer, a physicist at the 


HUE AND CRY 


119 



University of Maryland. It was this 
sphere shape, that the two scientific 
organizations (before mentioned) 
have decided to utilize. The phrase 
“basketball*’ was coined to give the 
general public an idea of its com- 
parative smallness. 

The 19.5 foot long satellite de- 
scribed in IF would be overcome by 
the residential air drag much sooner 
than would one of spherical shape 
ejected from the third stage of a 
minimum orbital rocket. 

The article is bristling with er- 
rors. I should hate to see the second 
installment. The Department of 
Defense has announced that the 
rocket will have a length of 72 feet, 
not quite the length of the first 
stage rocket described in Satellite . 
The first stage to be built by the 
Glen L. Martin Company (build- 
ers of the Viking) will have only 
one rocket motor, the entire rocket 
will be completely finless to save 
weight and reduce high speed drag, 
and both the motor of the first and 
second stage will be gimbaled. 

The article also states that the 
instrumentation in such a basket- 
ball shaped satellite would be scant, 
while the satellite announced by the 
department of defense, having a 
diameter of about 2}4 feet would 
have an easily computable volume 
of 10602.873000 plus, cubic inches. 
Apparently the authors have never 
heard of transistors and subminia- 
ture electronic parts. 

— S. Earl Cohen 
Winnetka, 111. 

We hate to bring this up — but if 
the reader noticed the authors were 
making an C( educated guess " at 


what they felt the satellite should 
look like — before any datum was 
released. The introduction also 
mentioned that Mr. Nuding is an 
Instrumentation Research Engineer 
and that Mr. Vanous is a designer 
of missile guidance systems — both 
work for well known corporations. 
Reading article number two might 
clear up some of the problems. 
Also , in the Editor’s note preceding 
the second installment , we took 
care to emphasize that the Nuding - 
Vanous designed rocket-satellite 
was for ultimate efficiency and not 
the early race to get “ something or 
anything * up there. 


EDITOR'S REPORT 


(Continued from page 3) 


One of the most provocative satires 
IF has published in its young life is 
Malice in Wonderland by Evan 
Hunter, who zoomed into notice 
with The Blackboard Jungle. Now 
it looks like we’ll be reading 
“Malice” as a novel, as Hunter is 
now expanding it for the hard- 
backs. If it gets the promotion 
“Blackboard” received it will be a 
sensation. And if you can’t or won’t 
wait for the novel, look it up in the 
January, 1954, issue of IF. 

1957 marks the fifth birthday of 
IF Magazine and we are planning 
The First World of IF, an anthology 
of the best of the first five years, to 
commemorate the occasion. It will 
be a handsome paperback edition 
priced at 50c, but the distribution 
will be rather limited — so put your 
bid in early. — jlq
