THE WEEK THAT WAS 



A s this issue of Galaxy goes to 
press, we are just completing 
a rather confusing week. Two 
events in particular Have given 
us surprises^ — tEe apparent be- 
ginning of peace negotiations in 
Vietnam, and tlie opening of tEe 
long-awaited science-fiction mo- 
vie, 2001 — A Space Odyssey. 

As to Vietnam — well, as you 
know, we don’t usually use tfiis 
space to talk about mere 20tE 
century problems, preferring to 
confine our crystal ball gazing to 
more remote eras. But tKose of 
you who read last month’s Gal- 
axy will remember tEat, triggered 
by two advertisements placed by 
groups of science-fiction writers, 
one in favor of an immediate end 
to the Vietnam war and tKe oth- 
er opposed, we decided to put the 
resourcefulness of science-fiction 
writers, readers and others in- 
volved to the test; we began then, 
and continue now, a contest in- 
viting you and everymie else in- 
terested to offer fresh ideas on 
what to do about Vietnam. 

By the time you read this 
(there’s a natural two-month lag 
involved) )the whole thing may 
be a dead issue. Or it may not. 
(Our crystal ball won’t focus 
down that fine!) 

But it seems clear that all the 



fresh ideas and provocative sug- 
gestions that can be made will 
still be very useful. If the Viet- 
nam war ended tomorrow there 
would still be a need for new 
ways of dealing with armed con- 
flicts. So the contest goes on . 
and so do our plans for submit- 
ting whatever ideas we can get 
to a panel of experts, in the hope 
of making some of them practical 
and useful as well as original . 

In other words, if you were go- 
ing to enter don’t be deterred by 
anything that may have happen- 
ed in real time! 

A s to 2001, there’s a review of 
it on pp 193-194; we won’t 
attempt another one here. But 
here too at least one thing seems 
clear in a confusing situation: the 
science-fiction movie we’ve all 
been waiting for still hasn’t come 
along. 

We think it’s a disgrace that 
the most recent science-fiction 
movie made with a big budget, 
good actors and an actual sf writ- 
er preparing the script, not aimed 
at a juvenile market and uncon- 
taminated by camp, is Things to 
Come . produced in 1936. 

For heaven’s sake, why?

from you . and assume they will follow it. 

What would you tell them to do? 

Don't tell them. Tell us. We will take the most provocative and

of too words for each entry, preferably in the form of (a) your suggestion, 

(b) followed, if you wish, by a statement of why you think it worth doing. 

2. Suggestions may be on any area of American involvement in Vietnam 
— ways of winning the war, ways of bringing about a peaceful settlement, 
whatever you think would be of value. 

3. Five prizes of $100 each will be awarded to those entries which, 
in the opinion of the judges, best deserve them. In the event of duplicate 
suggestions, the first entries received will get the prize. Judges will con-

Dallas Texas, Texas. She cast him as a Circum-

HAUNTING TEXAS

TERRIBLE TERRA 



CtQon, you look like a Texan 

^ what ■got the hormone, but 
been starved since birth'. Like 
your Ma, Lyndon bless her, lifted 
a leg and dropped you into a 1»g 
black bag, and after you nothing 
but a crust and mini-carton oi 
milk once a month.” 

“True enough, noble sir. I was 
raised in the Sack and I am a 
TKn,” I answered the Portly Gi- 
ant in a voice fike distant thun- 
der, wKicK almost made me wet 
my tights, because up until this 
moment of my life I had been a 
high baritcMie. 

My senses told me I was whirl- 
ing at a punistung six lunagravs 
in a large cubical centrifuge. In 
fact, I could see tfie spinning and 
feel it in my inner ears until my 
senses gradually adjusted. On the 
same surface as I, were two gi- 
ants and a giantess in cowboy 
costumes and also three barefoot, 
hunchbacked, swarthy dwarfs in 
dirty shirts and pants. They were 
all poised expertly on ffieir feet, 
riding the centrifuge with elan. 
While under my black hood and 
cloak I was doubled up like a 
large bone-and-titanium lazy- 
tongs, trying to make the left 
knee-inotor of my exodceleton be- 
have — it either hunted wildly or 
wouldn’t respond at all to the 
8 



myoelectric impulses from tfie 
ghost-muscles of my left leg. 

I realized that the Portly Gi- 
ant must have seen me without 
my cloak, which now ml^t be 
Ei^ng an erect short Fat as read- 
ily as a folded tail Thin. 

I was hazy about How I’d de- 
barked from the Tsiolkavdcy. 
When the Longh'airs dope you to 
take accelerations of 24 lungraws, 
they don’t use aspirin. Even ^g^en 
you’re sandwiched between water 
mattresses. 

But I knew that outside tfie 
centrifuge lay the spaceport and 
city of "Venowknife, Canada, Ter- 
ra. 

The centrifuge’s two ends and 
two adjoining sides (but which 
were which?) were covered with 
a clnkl-simple mural of huge 
chalk-white cowboys on horses 
like elepthants chasing tiny Bp- 
stick-red Indians on ponies fike 
chihuahua dogs across a cactus- 
studded landscape. 'This battle of 
cockroaches and behemoths was 
signed with a Huge “Grandma 
Aaron.” The figures and scene 
seemed as inappropriate for frosty 
Yellowknife as my companions’ 
costumes, which Should have been 
parkas and snovsEoes. 

But who is a greenhorn, who 
has lived all his life in free fall 
a few thousand miles from Moth- 
er Luna, to pronounce on the cus- 
toms of Terrible Terra? 

The opposite surface was 

GALAXY 




crowded witH dazzling sunbursts. 
Hire a star cluster going nova. 

In one of tHe adjoining surfaces 
were two rectangular openings 
side by side. EacU was tKree feet 
wide, but one was more tKan ten 
feet long, tHe other less than five. 
I peered into them in vain to see 
stars or sections of Terra whip- 
ping past, but the rectangles were 
only hatches leading into another 
part of the centrifuge. Why there 
were two and so different in shape 
and size, where one would have 
done, I couldn’t imagine. 

H s I tried to coax my knee- 
motor properly alive and felt 
the six centrifugal lunagravs 
cruelly press the support bands of 
my exoskeleton into my skin and 
bones at armpits, thighs, crotch, 
etcetera, I asked myself: If this 
is what they use to toughen you 
up for Terra, what will Terra’s 
naked surface be like? 

Meanwhile I spoke aloud in the 
same inaudibly deep voice-from- 
grave, which' indeed fitted my ap- 
pearance of a black-shrouded 
burial mound with the central 
bump of my hooded head. I ask- 
ed, “Kindly direct me to the Yel- 
lowknife Registry of Mining 
Claims.” 

The Portly Giant regarded me 
with , benign interest. That one 
really rode the centrifuge with 
serenity. I marveled at his ability 
to handle so casually a mass at 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



least five times my own with ex- 
oskeleton. The three shoulder- 
bent dwarfs peered apprehensive- 
ly from close behind him, fear- 
frowns furrowing their low fore- 
heads under their greasy black 
hair. The Square Giant — I call- 
ed him that because he was all 
sharp shoulder- and jaw-angles, 
like William S. Hart of ancientest 
cinema — glanced up suspiciously 
from my open luggage. 

The Giantess went into a tizzy. 

“There you go again!” she 
whined. “I try to hostess you the 
best I can. After all, you’re our 
first visitor from space in a hun- 
dred years. But you keep boom- 
ing at me like all the rest of them 
fearful furry Russians and drum- 
ming Afric foreigners. And you 
keep booming mysteries. Where 
in the name of Jack is Yellow- 
knife?” 

She had long yellow hair out- 
side and big tits, or their simula- 
crums, inside her quasi-military, 
mini-skirted cowgirl costume; but 
her fluttery stupidity was flatten- 
ing my libido as well as my san- 
ity. I recalled my father telling 
me that drum majorettes had 
been one of the chief ruinations 
of Terra, along with' female-clad 
Communist athletes of whichever 
sex. 

“Here!” I thunder-rumbled 
from my hood. “Right here, where 
the Tsiolvoksky debarked me on 
direct orbit from Circumluna. In- 

9 




c!dentally, I’m not Russian, but 
of Anglo-Hispanic ancestry, 
though it’s true there are as many 
Russians as Americans in Cir- 
cumluna.” 

“The Tchaikovsky debarked 
you all right — in a stretcher, in 
case you’ve forgotten, and all 
wrapped^p in that black blanket, 
like a candidate for a coffin. Say, 
what are Mericans? Ancient 
greasers? But wHat I mostly 
meant to ask you was: WHere do 
you think here is?” 

“Tsiolkovskyt” I tiEunder-cor- 
rected. My new double-base voice 
was making me nasty. “Great 
space pioneer, not gay composer 
of slurpy music. And Americans. 
A-m-e-r-i-c-a-n-s. Wlule here” I 
thunder-crashed, “is Spaceport 
Yellowknife, Northwest Territory, 
Canada, Terra 1” 

“Name of Jack and Jackiel” 
she wailed, clapping Her hands to 
her ears. “Where and sriiat is 
Canada?” 

'^he Square Giant looked up 
again and asked ominously, 
“Stranger, why does yoiu’ luggage 
consist chiefly of 47 Isotopic and 
lithium-gold batteries of the sort 
used in portable power weapons?” 

“They’re spares for my exo- 
skeleton,” I tossed Qm, while at 
the Giantess I rumbled scornfully, 
“Don’t they teach you any geo- 
graphy on this planet? You a 
space hostess!” 

10 



“It’s you don’t know geo- 
graphy,” she whimpered back at 
me, still holding her ears. "Up 
there in space, jumping from star 
to star and never caring which. 
Gun you, you’re making me cry, 
you animated black laundry bas- 
ketl” Whereupon very large tears 
(hd begin to plop from the inner 
comers of her blue eyes. 

If only the centrifuge would 
stop, I thought. I could no longer 
see spin, but I was whirling in- 
side. 

“Stranger, what class of weapon 
is an X-O-Skeleton?” the Square 
Giant demanded, his mouth and 
eyes thinning to slits. “And watch' 
your language when conversing 
with a cultured lady.” 

"You’ll find out when you’re 
kicked by one!” I snarled, mean- 
ing Faithful Old Titanium, not 
that female boob. “Cultured 
ladyl” I continued zestfully. 
“Cultured in an algae vat! You 
yeast-brain, how can you and that 
ri^t-angle cowpoke mention cul- 
ture when you confuse satellites 
with stellar furnaces, don’t know 
where Canada is, don’t under- 
stand the needs of a Thin visiting 
a solar gravity satellite and are 
unfamiliar with well known pros- 
thetic devices?” 

The Giantess began to blubber. 
,The fright-frowns deepened and 
rose in the dwarfs’ foreheads, 
their greasy hair stirred, and their 
fli^t-muscles tightened.

Ever since Lyndon ousted 
Jack in the Early Atomic Age, 
the term of a President of 
Texas has been from inaugu- 
ration to assassination. Mur- 
der is merely the continuation 
of politics by other means. 

Power ennobles, but Pe- 
trolium Power ennobles 
absolutely. 

The end of life is liberty. 
Texans are empowered to en- 
joy, exploit and handle lib- 
erty; while Mexes, Injuns, and 
Nigras— all those having dark 
faces or a dark hole in their 
pecketboohs— have the privi- 
lege of serving liberty and 
keeping their hands off it. 

Ego was made to be used. 
It rises from the dork uncon- 
scious, energizes awareness 
and transforms society. It is 
the oilfields of the human 
personality. 

Longhairs have less brains 
than longhorns and less abil- 
ity to stand on their own hind 
legs. Most Longhairs perished 
in the Atomic War or were 
exiled to that sick-cow-corral, 
Circumluna. and her un- 
speakable udder, the Sack.

The Square Giant whipped 
from his belt a lightning-pistol I 
knew could numb or fry me, ac- 
cording to how much power he 
used. He took a step toward me 
and barked, “Hand over that X- 
O-SkeletoH, Stranger, without you 
cock it. And whatever other weap- 
ons you’re hiding under that 
black serape. Everything down to 
hatpins and pinknives is confis- 
cated at the Republic’s borders — 
you’ll get claim checks. But don’t 
make any sudden movements 1” 
The tension sizzled. I stayed 
squat- crouched under my cloak 
and prepared to spit more insults 
from my hood. In fact, something 
violent might well have happen- 
ed, most likely to me, if the Port- 
ly Giant hadn’t intervened. 

That one said in resonant, re- 
laxed tones that muffed not a 
word (I’d been suspecting he was 
a fellow actor), “Simmer down, 
all of you, for Lyndon’s sake, that 
secular saint of peace. There’s 
been some natural mistakes made 
and some natural tempers rous- 
ed. Bill, go easy with’ that shock- 
spitter. And, Suzy, sweetheart, 
dry your tears and unsnuffle that 
cute little nose of yours. 

ttQcully,” he addressed to me, 
^ “Scully — for that’s what 
you look like from what I can 
glimpse of your face, a sort of 
sensitive-featured skull. No of- 
fense intended! My own handle’s 
12 



Elmo, and I’m as fat as and got 
a face like a hog, cross-bred witlj 
a hyena. But well, Scully, I’m 
afraid that they truly didn’t teach 
you quite all of modem geo- 
graphy up there in the sky. Yep, 
there’s a few things been happen- 
ing here and there on this little 
old planet during the century you 
been sailing around the moon in 
your ivory tower with its atten- 
dant soap bubbles. 

“Because there is a Yellowknife, 
you see, Scully, but now we call 
it Amarillo Cuchillo, and it’s sit- 
uated in Northern Texas. While 
Canada is a gone land, like Su- 
meria or Burgundy or Vietnam.” 

A cold and dizzy feeling — as 
if I hadn’t been centrifuged dizzy 
enough — touched me. A feeling 
of history altering like the colors 
in a kaleidoscope and no patch of 
reality sure. I already knew, you 
see, that my father, who taught 
me everything, was weak on re- 
cent Terran geography and his- 
tory, though expert in historical 
dramas and over-all theory. He 
would wave at Spengler’s dog- 
eared, accordion-opened Decline 
oi the West floating by our book- 
rack, then through the curving 
wall of the Sack at Terra splendid 
against the stars, and say, “They 
are all fellahin down there, Chris- 
topher, all of them. Fellahin 
swarming like moths over the 
embers of dead cultures. Ah, to- 
morrow and tomorrow and to- 

GALAXY 




morrow creeps in this petty pace 
from day to day.” (What is 
moths?) A ptcturesque and even 
ego-imflstmg generality, especial- 
ly to one living a quarter of a 
million miles or so from Earth, 
but admittedly weak on details. 

And now at last I was learning 
just how weak. 

I looked up af^refiensively at 
Elmo as the Portly Giant con- 
tinued, “And I’m afraid, Scully, 
that the Russo- Yankee officers of 
the Taiolkovsky are a little feeble 
on modem pohtico-geograf^y 
too, because where they landed 
you — namely, here — is some 
two thousand miles south of Am- 
arillo CuchiUo. Scully, my friend, 
you have the Honor of being in 
Dallas, Texas, Texas — the heart 
of the human universe and the 
golden laurrf-crown of her cul- 
ture.” 

“Texas includes Canada?” I 
asked in a quavering base. “Is an 
independent nation?” 

“Scully, I hate to voice the least 
criticism of a man’s educational 
background — shucks, there’s 
been notable brains ’mongst refu- 
gees from New York City Cc^lege 
and Berkeley — but I do beHeve 
your heavenly geography irrstruc- 
tors have been notably remiss and 
maybe — no offense meant here 
neither — touched with Black or 
Slavic bias. 

“Scully son, ever since the 
Great Texasward Industrial Mi- 
A SPECTtR IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



gration and World War Three, 
Texas has extended from the Nic- 
araguan Canal to the North 
Pole, including most of Central 
America, all of Mexico, nearly all 
of Canada and aH that matters of 
the Flibberty-gibbct Forty-Seven 
— I mean the former United 
States of America. 

“That is, at present. We Texans 
might take a fancy to extend our 
boundaries any day. There’s 
Cuba to be reconquered and In- 
do-China and Ir^nd and Ha- 
waii and Hitfier Siberia. 

“But on the whole, we Texans 
are a peaceable, tolerant, shoot- 
and-let-^oot people. We whip- 
ped the Cherokees and the Mexi- 
cans, and we tied the Russians 
and Chinese, and we're inclined 
to rest on oar laurels — Tud^, of 
course, roused, when we get dy- 
namic as an automated cotton- 
picking rig goosed the program 
for an Irish jig. 

“But as for being independent, 
let nne tell you, Scully my boy, 
Texas is the goldumedest inde- 
pendentest nation in the entire 
annals of political science. No- 
body, bar some wise old Hellenes, 
really understood what individual 
freedom meant until Tfexas came 
along. But anyhow, wdcome to 
Texas, Scully, welcome to God’s 
Planet! Welcome down from the 
vastness of space, amigo — 
though you know, Scully, there’s 
really more functional space in 

T3 




Texas than there is in the entire 
twiddling universe of free fall and 
galaxies and other foolishness. So 
in Lyndon’s name lift yourself up 
from that black heap you’re in, 
boy, and put Her here!” (Now I 
was sure he was an actor, though 
of ancient oratorical school.) 

TTe advanced, followed closely 
by the swarthy dwarfs, act- 
ing like timid children, and held 
out toward me a big open hand. 

I did not respond, though truly 
touched by his hammy hospital- 
ity. (At heart all actors are hams 
and love it.) 

I was simply too tired and diz- 
zy. 

For many minutes I had been 
balancing hunched-crouched in a 
souped-up crazy-house of a cen- 
trifuge that was making my brain 
woozy as well as drowning my 
meager flesh in fatigue poisons. I 
had been fumbling futilely with 
tiring fingers at my balky knee- 
motor. I had been forcing my 
aching diaphragm to drag into my 
burning lungs an atmosphere like 
yeast stew flavored with hydro- 
gen sulphide. I had been putting 
up with rude nonsense from a 
dithery female and a fake cow- 
boy baggage inspector. I was still 
groggy from anti-grav drugs and 
bone-crushing, organ-popping ac- 
celerations aboard the Tsiolkov- 
sky. 

I had become deadly sick of 

14 



Terra while they were still getting 
me ready for her. 

So now this news that I’d been 
stranded two thousand gravity- 
paved miles from my destination 
was the last weight, you might 
say, in my centrifuge training- 
belt. 

(The centrifuge on Circum- 
luna only builds up to two luna- 
gravs, and I’d weighted my exo- 
skeleton to make it nearer eartH- 
grav.) 

“My unfolded handle is Elmo 
Oilfield Earp, lineal descendant of 
the noted gunslinger,’’ the Portly 
Giant coaxed. “What’s yours, 
Scully?’’ 

At that instant a second female 
waltzed into our section of the 
centrifuge through the shorter of 
the two side-by-side hatches. At 
the sight of her, my spirits sky- 
rocketed as if I’d just got simul- 
taneous shots of speed-euph'orin 
in seven different veins or been 
invited by Idris Mclllwraith’ into 
her cubical to help her dress for 
Eve in Shaw’s Back to Methuse- 
lah. What is it that some girls 
have can turn me on? — while the 
yellow-haired, tearful, sincere, 
big-tit Susies can extinguish' me. 
I know, sex. 

This new girl was dark as the 
hunchbacked dwarfs, and she 
wasn’t too much more than four 
feet tall; but she carried herself 
as if she were ten, her back flag- 
staff-straight with her glossy 

GALAXY 




blaclc fiair for a banner. She had 
a form like a scaled-down Venus 
de Milo. She was shod with 
gleaming black slippers with heels 
almost as high as her dainty feet 
were long. A red skirt swirled 
around her black-netted dancer’s 
legs, a yellow blouse bared her 
coffee-and-cream shoulders, while 
her dark eyes snapped bright 
black light as castanets do bright 
black sound. 

I was so taken with Her mere 
looks that I forgot to admire the 
skill with which she moved grace- 
fully across areas having different 
acceleration vectors. 

And then she gave it to me. The 
eye, I mean. Yes, she halted in 
mid-twirl, and she looked at me 

— 3res, at miserable me, Huddled 
under my cloak like a sick giant 
spider monkey — and then her 
delicious eyes were fixed on my 
hooded, deep-socketed ones and 
glowing love into me, while her 
previously saucy lips were parted 
in a rapt smile of delight, as if I 
were the answer to some extreme- 
ly private dream she’d been hav- 
ing ever since the first downy 
shiver of puberty. 

My depression vanished like 
black magic routed by the White 
Goddess leading a train erf nym- 
phomaniac nymphs. What were 
six lunagravs? Terra was mine! I 
was the Count of Monte Cristo! 

— a part I Have twice played al- 
ready. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



S till operating wholly under my 
cloak, I untelescoped slim 
canes from my titanium exo-fore- 
arm-bones and with them and my 
good leg pushed myself erect and 
then still more erect until my 
head was on a level with those of 
the giants. The dwarfs’ eyes, 
steadily widening, followed me 
up. I noted that although they 
were of different heights, the 
dwarfs were all shoulder-bent to 
an equal four and a half feet — 
an odd detail. 

Once fully erect — now I top- 
ped the giants by a half head — 
I pushed down bolts to lock both 
knee-joints of my exoskeleton and 
stood on my two feet only, my 
exo-legs rigid rods from ankle to 
hip. Though teetery, it was prac- 
tical — the taller the object, tfie 
easier it is to balance. I quickly 
retelescoped my canes — if BiH 
the Square Giant glimpsed them, 
he would surely cry, “Concealed 
weapons!’’ 

Meanwhile Elmo was calling to 
my vest-pocket Carmen, “Well, 
it’s about time, Kookie. You bet- 
ter have those reefers, or I’ll turn 
you up and tan your Persian- 
rose-petal hide. Oh Scully, this is 
La Cucaracha, one of my sociable 
secretaries. Kookie, this is my 
bosom friend Scully from outer 
space. Treat him as you would 
the President of Texas before he 
went crackers.” 

Ignoring these rude and bois- 

15 




terous, though apparently well 
meant remarks, I stepped out 
swiftly and reached my dark love- 
ly one in three long strides and 
bowed until my Hooded face was 
level with hers. Considering I Had 
no knees at the time, it was a 
remarkable performance, putting 
my blaclfi-sHrouded butt a couple 
of feet higher than my Head. My 
myoelectricity was tuning my 
stiff-kneed exoskeleton to perfec- 
tion. It was truly a grand gesture, 
executed with’ ultimate poise and 
panache. 

Thrusting a hand from my 
cloak, I plucked Hold of her dain- 
ty one as if it were a dark orchid 
— and it was, ah velvet-surfaced, 
manipulative multi- wand I 

“Senorita Cockroach sublima” 
I rumbled throatily (and even the 
muted thunder of my rumble 
didn’t faze her). “I am Christo- 
pher Crockett La Cruz, totally at 
your service!” And I drew the 
captured bloom into my Hood and 
showered kisses on it. 

She, in the intervals of a flat- 
tered laugh and with much rip- 
pling of long black eyelashes, 
whispered toward my ear in a 
voice very fast and businesslike, 
though tender, “At moonrise to- 
night, amado. At the bandstand 
corner of the cemetery, querido 
mio. Until then — silencio!” 

It is the proper function of 
woman to attend to the practical 
details of affairs of the heart. 

16 



Assured by her words that I 
was not only loved but desired, I 
put into my obediently whisper- 
ed, Si, si, sir’ the hiss of a love- 
struck micrometeorite whizzing 
through the self-sealing duraplast 
of one of the eggs forming the 
Sack. 

Then I returned her hand to her 
with a flourish, un- jackknifed to 
normal height and turned toward 
the others. 

T felt as if I Had just magnifi- 
cently rendered one of Ham- 
let’s soliloquies or Cyrano’s ti- 
rades and the applause was 
about to break from the doubly- 
curving walls of our free-fall thea- 
ter-in-the-sphere in the largest 
bubble of the Sack. An inner voice 
said, “Stop your skulking 
masquerade, Scully-Christopher. 
Show yourself fully to these mis- 
erable earthlings and your dainty 
beloved.” 

With a Dracula batwing swirl, 
I threw back my black cloak and 
hood, flashing their scarlet lin- 
ings, and waited for the gasps of 
admiration. 

Suzy wailed, “Holy Hallow- 
een!”, vanished her large blue 
irises upward and fainted. As he 
caught her. Bill yelled, “What’d 
I tell you? — he’s got power- 
armor!” While the three dwarfs 
jumped backward and, I do be- 
lieve, would have dashed In terror 
from the room except that Elmo 

GALAXY 




reacfied beHind him and neatly 
collared them, meanwhile scowl- 
ing at me incredulotBly. One of 
the captured dwarfs quavered, 
“La Muetie Alttd" Anodier gasp- 
ed, “£/ EapeciroJ” While tlie third 
stuttered, El Eagueletol” 

Being called a tall death, a 
specter and a skeleton iilced me 
greatly. To Have people scared rf 
one (unless the part calls for it) 
when one is a fine, loving chap 
and for lagniappe a great actor 
is most irritating. 

But before saying anything cut- 
ting, an 3 dhing with acid in it, I 
put myself in their places and 
rapidly looked at me. 

They were looking, I discover- 
ed, at a handsome, ^lapely, dra- 
matic-featured man 8 feet 8 inch- 
es tall and massing 147 pounds 
with and 97 pounds without his 
exoskeleton. Except for relaxed 
tiny bulges of muscle in forearms 
and calves (latter to work lengthy 
toes, useful in gripping), this man 
was composed of skin, bones, lig- 
aments, fasciae, narrow arteries 
and veins, nerves, small-sire as- 
sorted inner organs, ghost mus- 
cles and a big-dmned skull with 
two bumps of jaw muscle. He was 
wearing a skin-tight black suit 
that left bare only his sunken- 
cheeked, deep-eyed, beautiful tra- 
gic face and big, heavy-tendoned 
hands. 

This truly magnificent, roman- 
tically handsome, rather lean man 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



was standing on two eorrugated- 
scJed titanium footplates. From 
the outer edge of each rose a nar- 
row tita n i u m T beam that follow- 
ed the line of his leg, with a joint 
(locked now) at the knee, up to 
ffliotSer joint with a titanium pel- 
vic gircfle and dsallow belly sup- 
port. From the back of tffis gtrdk 
a T spine rose to support a shoul- 
der yc^e and rib cage, ah of tiie 
same metal. The rib cage was ar- 
tistically slotted to save weight, 
so that curving strips followed the 
line of each of His very promineHt 
ribs. 

A continuation of His T spine 
up the back of bis neck in turn 
supported a snug, gleaming h'eed- 
ba^et that rose behind to curve 
over his shaven cranium, but in 
front was little more than a jaw- 
s&lf and two inward-curving 
cheek-jdates stopping just short 
of his somewhat rudimentary 
nose. The nose is not needed in 
Circumluna to warm or cool air.) 

Slightly lighter T beams than 
those for his legs rcmfwced his 
arms and housed in their terminal 
inches his telescoping canes. Nu- 
merous black, foam-padded bands 
attached this whole framework to 
him. 

A most beautiful prosthetic, one 
had to admit. While to expect a 
Thin, or even more a Fat, from a 
free-fall environment to function 
without one cm a gravity planet 
or in a centrifuge would be the 

17 




ultimate in comt;>all ignorance. 

Eight small electric motors at 
the principle joints worked the 
prosthetic framework by means of 
steel cables riding in the angles of 
the T beams, much like antique 
dentists’ drills were worked, I’ve 
read. The motors were controlled 
by myoelectric impulses from His 
ghost-muscles, transmitted by 
sensitive pick-ups buried in the 
foam-padded bands. They were 
powered by an assortment of iso- 
topic and lithium-gold batteries 
nesting in his pelvic and pectoral 
girdles. 

D id this fine man look in the 
least like a walking skele- 
ton? — I demanded of myself 
outragedlyl Well, yes, very much 
so, I had to admit now that I had 
considered the matter from the 
viewpoint of strangers. A very 
Handsome and stylish skeleton, all 
silver and black, but a skeleton 
none the less and one eight feet 
eight inches tall, able to look 
down a little even at the giant 
Texans aroimd him. 

I realized now that my anger 
and my inability to see myself as 
others see me had been because 
Father and Mother had found 
nothing morbid or eerie about me 
in my new, silvery anti-grav pros- 
thetic — nor Had the Longhairs 
who had constructed it for me in 
return for free performances of 
Hamlet, Macbeth and Manhattan

Project, two jam-sessions and one

Idris Mclllwraith, the Sack’s per-

me and looks like the ancient 
high-fashion model Teeny (Twil- 
ly? Twiggy?) drastically slimmed 
down, yet has much appeal. I ask 
her once a month to marry me, 
but although granting occasional 
favors, she refuses me always on 
the silly grounds that she is thrice 
my age. Who dies in free fall? 

I glanced down at my newer 
love, the sublime La Cucaracha, 
and she was gazing up at me and 
my exoskeleton with as fond ap- 
proval as my parents and with 
something spicy added. But when 
I made to bow to Her again and 
perhaps Hear more exciting whis- 
pers about our coming rendez- 
vous, she twinkle-toed away, 
drawing from a fancy pack a long, 
very thin, pale brownish cigarette. 

“Scully Christopher Crockett 
La Cruz,” Elmo meanwhile Hailed 
me from where he stood talking 
with Bill, while still collaring the 
three dwarfs. Suzy had sat up 
from her faint and was looking at 
me with a thin-lipped disapprov- 
al, which I connected with the at- 
tentions I had showered on La 
Cucaracha. 

“That Crockett’s a good Texas 
handle,” Elmo continued. “Deep- 
ens my friendship for you, boy. 
Anyhow, Scully, I been consid- 
ering your problems. There’s a

might lift you to Amarillo CucK-

commerce in a relaxed fashion. So 
Bill here has agreed to release you 
into my custody, and you and I 
are going to pay a littie visit on 
the Governor of Texas, Texas — 
and what He can’t expedite, no- 
body else can even budge. 

“Besides, it ain’t every day we 
get a spaceman. Governor bound 
to want to hear the gossip about 
the long-interdicted lands in the 
sky. Who can tell, tliey might 
turn out to be far-flung fragments 
of Texas. 

“Scully, you can’t refuse — 
you’re going to experience Texas 
hospitality if 1 Have to tie you 
up and have my greasers lug you. 

“Now jump for his baggage, 
you black-hearted little conquis- 
tadores, or I’ll sell you for cy- 
borgs!” He released the three 
bent-backs, while to my darling 
he called, “Light me that stick 
now, Rookie, pronto, or I’ll re- 
turn your wardrobe to the theater 
man for refund, all but one Medi- 
eval onion sack.” 

I hate to be pushed around, 
especially by big-brotherly 
shoves, nor did I care for the lan- 
guage Elmo directed at my new 
nymph, but his proposition seem- 
ed tiie best for me. Especially 
since I did not intend to leave 
Dallas before getting my gravity

legs arid — Eros ^ure! — keep- 
ing my moon-cued rendezvous. 
For even now as the little one 
grasped Elmo’s wide belt, nimbly 
vaulted onto his slightly-bent, 
huge thigh and hung the smolder- 
ing slim cigarette on lus long loose 
lip, she gave a quick conspira- 
torial smile and eyelash-ripple, 
telling of impending raptures. 

Elmo took a long fluttering in- 
halation of marijuana vapor, his 
eyes going first glassy, then fever- 
bright as he called out, “Now for- 
ward hop, you greasers alll Come 
on, Scully, let’s skedaddle.” 

'T'he three dwarfs now each car- 
ried a black, silver-banded 
cushion-case containing chiefly 
my food concentrates and spare 
batteries, my winter clothing and 
wigs. They still snatched fearful 
glances at me. As I followed Elmo 
toward the ten-foot door, they 
marched through the shorter door, 
each of the three barely missing 
bumping his head on the lintel, 
while my brunette darling scam- 
pered through behind them, her 
head held high. 

Why their backs were variously 
bent, and hers not at all, was 
instantly clear to me. 

The enormity of the revelation, 
plus my hunting for vector- 
changes in the centrifuge’s floor 
and still not finding them, must 
have caused mo to take short, 
shuffling steps with my tempor- 

19 




arily kneeless five-foot legs, for 
Elmo looked back and exclaimed, 
“Scully son, you’re walking like 
the first time on stilts, or Cke you 
got paresis. Maybe our Mexican 
door sort of startled you. It’s one 
of those .charming, deeply-mused 
Texan Customs that make our 
glorious way of life possible. You 
see, Scully, a man can’t feel really 
free unless he’s got a lot of imder- 
folk to boss around. That’s one of 
the great paradoxes of liberty, 
first discovered by those proto- 
Texans, the ancient Greeks, who 
had slaves to bum, though I don’t 
think they actually burnt them 
much until Nero’s day or maybe 
till the discovery of gasoline, 
which permitted deep-south 
lynching bees and Buddhist im- 
molations alike. 

“Incidentally, Scully, I’d ap- 
preciate it if you’d button up that 
cloak of yours and resume your 
hood. Mexes are superstitious lit- 
tle buggers. Even when cyborged, 
their odd primitive fears short- 
circuit through. I got my three 
boys calmed temporarily — and 
La Kook’s a cool little bitch — 
but I wouldn’t want you causing 
a riot in Dallas. History proves 
that the first time a man goes 
down the streets of Dallas, any- 
thing can happen to him, fre- 
quently bad.” 

I complied with' his suggestion, 
but made no verbal retort, con- 
tenting m3fself with giving him a 
20 



grim look, sucking in my cheeks 
to increase the skull-like appear- 
ance of my head and stepping out 
after him recklessly. 

“A vigorous paresis, I got to 
admit,” he commented. 

Ahead of him another pw of 
doors began to slide open, lettii^ 
in sunny brightness and flashes 
of movement; and I braced my- 
self for transition from centrifugal 
force to gravity. 




DALLAS, TEXAS, TEXAS 

I teetered into blazing sunlight 
and a huge scene that was 
whirling around with me twenty 
times a minute, one full revolu- 
tion every three seconds for the 
dozens of Texas giants I now 
saw, the hundreds of glass-and- 
metal living volumes, the thou- 
sands of rapidly moving Mexi- 
cans — most of these with mas- 
sive metal collars from which 
rose small antennas — and even 
the blue sky, the marshmallow 
clouds and the blinding sun. 

The entire universe had become 
a vast centrifuge, and I one mote 
spinning near its center, an axis 
a dozen yards above my head. I 
staggered and reeled on my stilt- 
legs, waiting for the sky to burst 
and the cosmos to rip apart from 
the incredible centrifugal forces. 

GAIAXY 



When the scientific, engineering 
and paramilitary communites of 
the international mega-satellite 
Circumluna were ordered to carry 
World War 3 into space, they re- 
fused, relying on their charters 
from the United Nations. In des- 
peration and reprisal, the warring 
powers below repudiated the 
Uni ted Nations, clapped embargoes 
on all shipments of food, fuels, 
metals, medicines and other sup- 
plies to Circumluna and outlawed 
their rebellious nationals there. The 
Circumlunans, who effectually con- 
trolled the space fleets end were 
on the verge of achieving a self- 
sufficient economy based on raw 
materials from the Moon, declared 
their independence. This action of 
“the tonghairs” was enthusiastic- 
ally received by the even longer- 
haired space-vagabonds— originally 
hippies, beatniks, mods, dropouts, 
stfiyagl, actors, writers, pachukos, 
apaches, gypsies and other quaintly 
styled rebels— parasitic on [or sym- 
biotic with; accounts differ] the re- 
spectable Circumlunans and living 
in their hive of dpraplastia bubble 
homes pendant on Chctunluna and 
knovim as the Sack; For five gen- 
erations there was no commerce 
and little communication between 
Terra and Circumluna, due to the 
latter’s focus on survival and to 
the cultural upheavals and impov- 
erished economy below after World 
War 3 killed its billion and fizzled 
out. When the Interdict, as it came 
to be called, was lifted one hun- 
dred years later, the first Circum- 
lunans and "Sackabonds" to plumb 
the gravity well and visit Earth 
were a surprise to its inhabitants, 
but the centuries-alienated space- 
folk found Terra a still greater 
shock.

Short History of Circumluna, by 
John Washington and Ivan Alapin 




Then I realized my error, and 
the scene stopped spinning with a 
suddenness that almost knocked 
me down. 

What I had been interpreting 
as centrifugal force back in the 
room muraled with Indians and 
Texans^’ had been only normal 
Earth gravity. 

I learned in that instant that 
you can endlessly explain to a 
person who’s lived all his life in 
free fall that human senses can- 
not distinguish between the ef- 
fects of acceleration, with vdaich 
he’s familiar, and gravity, of 
which he’s had no experience. You 
can tell him that until your voice 
fails. No matter, he’ll still go on 
believing that gravity will ieel 
different, that it will grab him 
with invisible gluey fingers, that 
it will have in it the taint of un- 
imaginable cubic miles of soil, 
rock, magma, incandescent core- 
material, and other dirty plane- 
tary horrors. 

I no sooner had been experi- 
ence-educated out of one illusion 
than I became the victim of an- 
other; I felt I had returned to 
airless space. 

When a man who has lived all 
his life in a null-grav satellite, a 
large but limited homeland of 
many rooms, steps outdoors for 
the first time on a planet, one of 
his strongest immediate reactions 
is to hold his breath'. Not from 
wonder and amazement, though' 
22 



they are there, but because the 
only comparable situation He 
knows is that of a man plunged 
into the vastness of space without 
an air supply. Ignoring the ground 
under his feet and the gravs press- 
ing him to it, he will automatical- 
ly see the unbounded sky as vac- 
uum and any building around 
him as pressurized volumes to 
which he must win his way in 
seconds, or die. I held my breath. 

But I did not run, or — the 
actual impulse, to follow which 
would have resulted in my bark- 
ing my nose on Texas — launch 
myself in an intended straight- 
line trajectory at the nearest win- 
dow or door. Perhaps my first bit 
of experience-education made the 
second come quicker. Though still 
staggering about, I exhaled vio- 
lently and forced myself to draw 
a lungful of the soupy air, stinkier 
now that we were outside. Besides 
discovering that I was in anything 
but vacuum, I also realized the 
explanation for my deep voice. 
All my life, even in the Tsiolkov- 
sky, I had been breathing a light 
oxygen-helium mix with small 
amounts of carbon dioxide and 
water vapor. Now I was subsist- 
ing on a thick witch’s brew of the 
same oxygen, but stewed in grav- 
ity’s pressure-cooker with nitro- 
gen and assorted taints. A heavier 
atmosphere, a deeper voice. As 
obvious as that — but only after 
it’s happened to you. 



GALAXY 




I looked around and down, to see 
• tliat under La CucaracKa’s di- 
rections Elmo’s three servants had 
dropped my bags and were cir- 
cling me as I reeled, ready to 
break my fall when I finally top- 
pled. 

Elmo called back cheerily, 
“You drunk, partner? Didn’t 
know the super-refreshing open 
- air of Texas was that intoxicating 
to the uninitiated. I forget you’re 
a Sackabond, reared on a little 
denatured oxygen and perfume.” 
As I steadied myself, a whole 
gaggle of new little Mexicans 
came scurrying all around me, a 
couple of the tiniest ones even 
tugging at my cloak, and most of 
them calling up to me, “Benediga 
nosotros, padre/” They were a 
raggedy, colorful lot, chiefly 
women and children, and none of 
them, praise Diana, wore those 
disgusting metal neck-and-sKoul- 
der pieces. 

I’m enough of an actor to ad- 
lib any role I’m thrust into, so I 
stuck two fingers out of my cloak, 
made a squiggle with them, and 
rumbled benignly, “Benedicite, 
mis ninos y ninas," adding for 
good measure, “Bless you, my 
children.” 

It seemed natural enough for 
them to mistake me with my robe 
and hood for a tall priest or 
monk, maybe a Black Franciscan. 

My ready response to their re- 
quest seemed to satisfy them 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



fully, for they were already scam- 
pering off when Elmo boomed, 
“Get away from the God-man be-< 
fore you trip him with your ro- 
saries, you church-struck little 
greasers! Scully, you’re a card, 
but we got to make tracks for the 
Governor’s ranch house. Are you 
over your dizziness enough to ride 
a horse?” 

I was about to respond, “Yes, 
of course. You think I’m a sissy, 
hombre?” when a feeling of dizzi- 
ness and weakness did strike me. 
A steady six lunagravs and assort- 
ed startlements had been getting 
in their licks on my somewhat 
delicate physiology. My heart was 
pounding as it pumped blood to 
my brain — no small job, consid- 
ering my height and the gravs. I 
also was glad I was wearing an 
extra-snug Sack-suit, to help my 
leg veins from going varicose and 
maybe even popping as they 
pushed blood up that weary dis- 
tance from my toes. 

I tongued pep, instant-glucose 
and antigrav pills out of their 
cheek-plate container into my 
mouth. Even the tiny dissolving 
pellets seemed heavy as osmium 
on my tongue, and they dropped 
down my throat like bullets. I 
followed them with a sip of truly 
heavy water from my other cheek 
plate, tilting my exo- skulled head 
to do so. They quickly helped. La 
Cucaracha beamed up at me her 
congratulations, as if she already 

23 




knew my inner feelings as well as 
I did. 

By that time, tiowever, Elmo 
bad a twenty-foot nncraled 
and was cracking it over a low 
narrow, vehicle somewhat longer 
than I*was. 

It bounced along on two cater- 
pillar treads moved by ten wheels. 
The wheels fascinated me. Except 
in pictures or employed as pul- 
le3Ts, one never sees wfieels in Cir- 
cumluna, where there is no grav- 
ity to put teeth in friction. 

Off the vehicle were scramtding 
a couple of dozen Mexicans, in- 
cluding some of those who had 
received my benediction, while 
Elmo was shouting relaxedly, 
“Get off that cat-wagon, pronto, 
you fun-loving, irresponsible little 
monkeys! The Black Pope here 
needs it. I’ll see it gets back to 
your patrom” Then to me he 
said, “Climb aboard, Scully, and 
stretch out your weary exoskele- 
ton. Ordinarily we don’t let Mexes 
use power cars, but a cat-wagon’s 
no more than a toy. However, it’s 
just what the metallurgical osteo- 
path ordered for yom I can tell 
you’re too frazzled to mount a 
steed yet and, come to think of it, 
I don’t suppose they have too 
many cayuses in Circumlima, and 
those pretty spiritless.” 

Oddly, he was ri^t about that. 
CL did have a few horses for old- 
style serum factories and on the 
Noah’s Ark principle.

T started to tell him I was splen-> 
A didly unfrazzled and eager to 
kam the art of iK^semanship, but 
my heart was still pound&ng a bit, 
so I decided to conserve energy 
and keep my attention free for the 
weird sights around me. I did an- 
other of my stiff-kneed bows, 
braced my hands on an end of the 
cat-wagon, transferred my feet to 
the other end, kt myself down on 
my face and then rolled over with 
a minimunt of exoskeletal clank- 
ings. 

My heart quieted now that my 
circulatory system wasn’t fighting 
gravity as hard. I felt better, ex- 
cept that I couldn’t see much be- 
sides the sky. I raised my head 
and scanned. 

Elmo had coiled his whip and 
was hooking it to his silver-stud- 
ded leather belt, which also sup- 
ported two lightning pistols. Oth- 
erwise he was dressed in what I 
took to be a conservative Terran 
business suit, complete with cuffs, 
buttons, lap^ cottar and great 
sky-colored tie depicting blue- 
boimet flowers; but on his feet 
were huge, EgH-Heeled leather 
boots, and on his head a six- 
(twelve? factorial four?)-gaHon 
hat. 

He was astride a horse as huge, 
relatively, as he was. I marvried 
at the bone- and muscle-power of 
both — his to motmt and the 
beast’s to carry. In fact, for a 
moment I toyed with the notion 

GALAXY 




tliat he had an exoskeleton under 
his suit, and the animal a surgi- 
cally implanted steel one. 

He noted my gaze and said, 
“Yep, Scully, we feed our mounts 
the hbrmone too. Next to Texans, 
they’re God’s noblest creation. 
And now you might punch the 
cat-wagon’s first go-button at 
your elbow. The lever next it 
steers her.” 

I complied, and our small cav- 
alcade started off at a pace brisk 
to me, a novice driver. Elmo 
merely walked his horse ahead of 
us, but its strides were long and 
smooth. Just behind him La Cu- 
caracha jounced on a btirrow — 
now I understood those dispro- 
portionate murals better. My 
darling rode side-saddle and re- 
galed me with frequent smiles 
over-shoulder, while to the rear 
Elmo’s three Mexicans jogged 
with my bags. There was a dis- 
proportion I could correct. 

"SenoT Elmo,” I called, “tell 
your boys to throw my bags on 
the wagon and hop aboard them- 
selves. There’ll be no overload — 
despite my metal, I mass low.” 

“That’s out, Scully,” he boomed 
back. “Can’t have greasers riding 
with anything Texas-tall, no mind 
how skinny or strange. Myself, I 
been around and tolerate indecen- 
cies, but ’twould shock Dallasians 
spitless.” 

“I want the bags for pillows,” 

I explained, “so I can study Dal- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



lasian salivation, et cetera, besides 
scan the road.” 

“Then that’s okay. But the oth- 
er’s out. Peel your eyes, partner. 
You got a lot more to see than 
Texas Adam’s apples bobbing. 
Hey, you greasers, comfort my 
guest’s cerebrum with his lug- 
gage!” 

I was inclined to argue longer 
with him about them riding, but 
the three Mexicans gave me such 
apprehensive glances as they 
trembling-handed tucked my bags 
in a soft stack imder my Head and 
seemed so eager to return to their 
rear-guard position, that I de- 
cided to postpone any equalitar- 
ian lecture. However, the fright- 
ened behavior of the three nagged 
at me. 

'^here was indeed much to see, 
most of it crazy to me, like 
a 3D motion-montage with' vol- 
umes moving at different camera 
speeds, and most of it jammed 
into a single plane — truly Terra 
is flatland. First there were the 
buildings, like cubical satellites 
crowded in disordered ranks, some 
many rooms long — no, high' — 
on end — and made of metal and 
glass, reminding me of Circum- 
luna. Between these went occa- 
sional gangways — streets — on 
one of which we traveled. Then 
there were the Texans, some on 
horses, others in slowly moving 
vehicles, others strolling afoot. 

25 




The younger seemed even taller 
than the older — I wondered if 
the hormone had a cumulative 
effect. 

Moving about thrice as fast and 
in numbers a decimal order great- 
er were the Mexicans, all of iden- 
tical bent-back Height and almost 
all afoot. About sixty percent 
wore the metal collars and anten- 
nas, and these were all furiously 
busy at various construction and 
deconstruction jobs — Half of our 
street was tom up, buildings were 
being dismantled, others assem- 
bled, great masts reared, great 
Holes dug. I even thought at first 
the collared workers could walk 
up walls — no strange sight to a 
space-dweller — until I noted that 
those on vertical surfaces were 
supported by slim wires, which 
they swiftly climbed or down- 
climbed. 

One might wonder at my being 
able to see so much while ma- 
neuvering a strange vehicle for the 
first time in a gravity field. But 
if one has a lifetime of experience 
moving in three dimensions, mov- 
ing in two is child’s play. I was 
soon driving the cat-wagon with 
such easy competence that I was 
able to spare a hand to work at 
my balky knee-motor and had it 
adjusted in a matter of seconds. 
I surely had been woozy on my 
first tryf 

I soon observed that I was at- 
tracting interest. The Texans’ 
26 



faces never turned toward me, but 
their eyeballs did, and they slow^ 
ed down in passing. The collarless 
Mexicans goggled me frankly, but 
speeded up, making wide curves 
around our cavalcade. The collar- 
ed ones, however, marched by 
with never a glance, like so many 
tiny, swift juggernauts, fortunate- 
ly people-avoiding ones. 

The speed of all the bent-backs 
surprised me. Father had told me 
all about Mexicans. A strict in- 
doctrination in racial and nation- 
al behavior had come very early 
in my education, because it is 
very important in the theater. 
Father had assured me that all 
Mexicans were short and wore 
serapes and big hats, went bare- 
foot and spent their lives sitting 
against adobe walls, smoking 
hemp and sleeping, except for 
brief periods of firing off pistols. 

These Mexicans were not at all 
like that, except for the short and 
barefoot parts. 

In fact, there were many types. 
Just now some wee Mexican chil- 
dren, cute as dark kittens, came 
toddling up and scattered flowers 
over me, most likely thinking me 
a corpse bound for the boneyard, 
for when I lifted and turned my 
head to look at them, they ran 
away. 

La Cucaracha had slowed her 
burro until she was jogging be- 
side me. She observed, “Legends, 
or lies, from the black lands tell 

GALAXY 




^at flower power was once a 
great flung. But here at least it 
Has died out.” 

Noting my special interest in 
the collared Mexicans, she ex- 
plained disdainfully, “They are 
cyborgs, the estupidos. Their col- 
lars feed them orders and happi- 
ness — straight into their veins 
and nerves. From a distance fore- 
men control them — after a fash- 
ion.” She added the last phrase 
when two files of cyborgs collided 
and instantly began a confused 
milling aimed at eventual disen- 
tanglement, like ants I had once 
watched in a flatland between 
glass. 

“They live like this forever?” I 
asked with some horror. 

“Ah no,” she assured me, “only 
during the working day. The ofli-* 
er ten hours they exist as men, 
employing what fragments of 
ptounded-adobe spirit they have 
left. Chiefly they feed, fornicate 
and sleep. My countrymen!” 

I recalled wh’at had been nag- 
ging me. “Senorita K,” I asked, 
“why is it that your countrymen 
regard me with a fear that is both 
more and less than fear? Explain 
that to me, if you will, mi amada 
bonita.” 

■^Tl^ith a rapid frown and fin- 
gershake, she leaned down 
and whispered wamingly, “No 
tendernesses until moonrise, as I 
first commanded you, you tall in- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



competent and undisciplined!” 
Then in an equally low, but most 
cool voice, she continued, “Senor 
La Cruz, my people are like chil- 
dren. They live by fairy tales, 
some sweet as sugar, some grisly 
as red bone. One of the latter tells 
of Death, tall as the sky who will 
one day come striding across Tex- 
as. He will have the form of a 
great skeleton — El Eequeleto, 
he’s named oftenest. He will be 
tossing like fritoe into bis great 
naked jaws and grinding there hu- 
man skulls — made of sugar- 
candy, some say, of fresh-torn 
bloody bone and brains, say oth- 
ers. My people will flock to him. 
He will give them never a glance, 
any more than stars and clouds 
look down at men, but he will 
lead them to freedom.” 

I had become so engrossed in 
her small but colorful tale that I 
almost started when a large voice 
inquired, “Kookie been feeding 
you a sob story about cyborgs?” 
Elmo had gradually let his own 
mount drift backwards until he 
too was beside me, on the oppo- 
site side of the wagon. “Don’t you 
believe a single word that comes 
out of her cute, lying, little post- 
age-stamp lips. Scully, my pal, 
cyborgs live a lot happLtf than 
Texans. Their joy comes each day 
sure as Coca-Cola. Besides, 
they’re essential to our liberty and 
freedom, as I’ve explained.” 
“Myself, I think fliey would all 

27 




be ti'ampled under the specter s 
bony feet — if they do not run 
like whipped dogs at sight of 
him,” La Cucaracha continued as 
coolly as if there Had been no in- 
terruption at all. “Cyborged or 
not, my people are estupidoa de 
estupidos.” 

“Cynical little bitch, ain’t she?” 
Elmo observed. “Kookie, you got 
an ice cube for a heart. Lucky for 
you your cold blood don’t chill 
your skin.” 

“My body, though small, is de- 
signed in classic proportions, es- 
teemed patron,” she replied to 
him tartly. 

“Now, Kookie, you mind your 
modesty and keep your mind Hid- 
den,” Elmo warned her. “Don’t 



A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



29 



you go starting an intellectual 
striptease front of me and my 
guest. T’other kind’s the only one 
a woman’s fitted for, greaser or 
gringo.” 

“You wish me to mop and mow 
like a madwoman, master? Or 
grunt to^Senor La Cruz, no sabe? 
Or discard my clothing perhaps?” 

“Now, Kookie, I’m telling you 
that if you don’t behave, I’ll — ” 

The altercation might have be- 
come unpleasant, except that at 
that moment I involuntarily in- 
terrupted it. We were approaching 
a gold or gilded statue twenty feet 
high of a most muscular man in 
barbarian garb. From his Helmet 
thrust very long and twisting 
horns. His right hand swung back 
a battleaxe, his left pointed a six- 
shooter. 

CtTT^ho is that?" I demanded, 
’ ’ pointing with a black- 
shrouded leg, because I was rid- 
ing feet first and my hands were 
busy driving. “I did not know 
that Terra had regressed to full 
barbarianism during the Inter- 
dict.” 

“Scully, ain’t you familiar with 
the discoverer of Texas, even, and 
its first decent-size hombie?" El- 
mo retorted in genially scandaliz- 
ed tones. “You mean to tell me 
you ain’t ever heard of Leif Eric- 
son, Paul Bunyan, Big Bill 
Thomson, John L. Sullivan, Wil- 
liam Randolph Hearst, Abraham 
30 



Lincoln and such other great Tex- 
ans?” 

“No,” I admitted, “though I 
have heard of Sam Houston, Jim 
Bowie and my namesake Davy 
Crockett.” 

“Oh, yeah, they were Texans 
too,” he admitted, “though on a 
more local plane, San Jacinto and 
Alamo boys. And old Raven Sam, 
though one of our early prexies, 
was pretty dubious in some ways 
— Indian lover and Yankee fel- 
low-traveler, it’s said.” 

I thought of asking him about 
Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ, 
but refrained for fear of having 
an attack of history-epilepsy. I 
might learn that they too had 
been Texans. 

Instead, I said, steering the cat- 
wagon around Leif Ericson, “I 
recognized some of the others you 
named, but thought them men of 
the United States and Canada.” 

La Cucaracha had jogged ahead 
again, though' not without giving 
me a quick lip-pursed smile and 
eyelash ripple. Elmo leaned out 
of his saddle toward me and said, 
“Scully, I can see your heavenly 
instructors knew only the super- 
ficial version of Earth’s history, 
the one pap-fed to the general 
public. Since you’re going to be 
meeting some mighty sophisticat- 
ed and influential men today, it’s 
best you know a scrap or two of 
the truth. Amigo mio, the Lone 
Star Republic never was one of 

GALAXY 




tHe United States. In 1845 she as- 
sumed leaderslup at them, be- 
cause she could see they needed 
bolstering against foreign aggres- 
sion and internal disorder; and 
that was a most accurate fore- 
sight, because she had to spend 
the next three years throwing 
back the attack of Mexico on 
them. And pretty soon she had 
the Civil War to run — both 
sides. 

“Of course it was given out to 
the general public of the states, 
who never had no brains or guts 
n<^bw and flustered easy, that 
this assumption at leadership was 
annexation — but it was always 
known to the speaker of the house 
and the senators who counted in 
Washington that by secretest 
treaty Texas was boss. There- 
after the Presidents in the White 
House were just figureheads for 
the Texas Estabisliment — 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, for in- 
stance, was the puppet of oiu' 
Jack Gamer, a mighty modest 
kingpin, just as later on Lyndon 
the Great bossed Jack Kennedy, 
though the latter was poethum- 
ously declared an honorary Tex- 
an and president thereof because 
of the grandeur and ritual impor- 
tance erf his demise. With the com- 
ing of the Third World War and 
the atomization of Washington, 
New Ymlc, San Francisco and so 
forth, secrecy became unneces- 
sary, and Texas took over in name

as well as substance, induing fot 
good measure the frosty top aad 
hot, dry, jungly bottom of tEe 
continent. We needed more greas- 
ers, anyhow, for therapeutic rea-* 
sons.” 

X^y mind was tossings like the 
cat-wagon, which was tra- 
versing a curving section of tfie 
street imder repair and trying to 
dodge Mexicans who were aaniil- 
taneously dodging me. I wisBed 
now I had had other histny in- 
structors besides my father, wEo 
would dispose of the conquest of 
a continent with an offhand “En- 
ter barbarians witii bettleaxes,” 
or of a civilization witU “Exit vo- 
luptuaries, wringing hands and 
screaming. Idris does quick naked 
dive-across.” I knew quite a bit 
of Greek, Roman and EnglisH dy- 
nastic history and the neurotic 
antics of Twentieth-Century nud 
from Ibsen and Bergman to Green 
Comedy and Inner-Space Multi- 
stage; but our repertoire had no 
late plays set in Texas, so father 
had brushed past that land quick- 
ly. (Mi, before my down-orbit Be*d 
briefed me on the Northwest Ter- 
ritory and Yellowknife minutely 
and whh great accuracy — I’d 
thought (now I was not so sure). 

“Well, I’ve had my say, and 
it’s your turn to talk, Scully,” 
Kmo interrupted. “You were say- 
ing something back there about 
the Yellowknife Registry of Min- 

31 




ing Claims?” {lis voice was sud- 
denly so casual and his memory 
so precise that for no other rea- 
sons I found myself getting sus- 
picious. But once again I was 
given opportunity to change the 
topic by a golden sculpture, this 
one abstract. 

Beside the street, about twenty 
meters up. Hung a golden rec- 
tangle, across the lower side of 
which was affixed, pointing acute- 
ly downward, wHat looked like a 
distance-weapon of some sort, all 
golden too. It was a few moments 
before I saw the slim, transparent 
pylon supporting tffls part of the 
abstraction, so near was the py- 
lon’s substance to heing invisible. 

The distance-weapon pointed at 
the other half of the abstraction, 
a most complex structure of pipes, 
wires, rods, springs and boxes, all 
golden too, about as long as my 
cat-wagon but wider and thicker. 
This fantastic brick of golden 
tracery was also supported by the 
near invisible substance, but at a 
height of only Half a meter. 

Pointing, Elmo explained, 
“There’s the window in the book 
depository from which Oswald 
fired the fatal shots, and that’s 
the chassis of the car in which 
Jack got gunned down, providing 
by that one brave act of his an 
example to all future presidents 
of Texas to go thm way cour- 
ageously when their political bell 
tolled. 

32 



“Incidentally, Scully — ” he 
continued, leaning a little lower in 
his saddle and pitching his voice 
likewise, “what I’m going to tell 
you now is pretty high-security 
stuff, but the menfolk where we’re 
going have got nothing whatever 
else in their skulls — deep waters, 
Scully, deep waters — so it’s only 
fair I give you a paddle or two to 
navigate with, and maybe an 
aqualung. And besides, we Texans 
don’t care much for security; we 
like things loose as the reins by 
which we herd our second-class 
citizenry. Anyhow, what I was 
going to tell you is tlus: Our cur- 
rent president of Texas is hedging 
a bit when it comes to following 
Jack’s great example. He’s dislik- 
ed, you see, but instead of stand- 
ing forth and dying like a man, 
he’s turned the President’s Manse 
into a fort and — believe it and 
weep I — he’s organized a corps 
of Mexican houseboys faithful to 
his person, and He’s armed them! 
With laser guns at that! WHicH 
ain’t playing fair at all to the 
political opposition. Why, he’s 
even kicked out His Texas-Ranger 
guards. Says he can’t trust them 
not to kill him — wfficH is true, 
of course, but uncouth to men- 
tion.” 

“It’s him we’re going to visit 
now?” 

“No, you got it all wrong, Scul- 
ly, though his Manse is Here in 
Dallas, where all important things 

GALAXY 




are. We’re going to visit the 
RancB of Cotton Bowie Lamar, 
governor of Texas, Texas — that 
is, governor of the father state in 
the world’s greatest nation. We’re 
not going to Have anytlung to do 
at all witfi tKat dastardly, Mexi- 
can-arming tyrant Longhorn Eli- 
jah Austin, current bossman of 
that same greatest nation, though 
it pains me to say so.” 

“You hope to defeat him at the 
next election?” I asked. 

Elmo shook his head and suck- 
ed his lips with a plop. “Nope, 
Scully, in achieving real freedom 
we’ve long ago discarded the 
phantasms of democracy. For the 
immaterial, ignoble ballot we’ve 
resubstituted the material, ritual- 
ly prrferable, noble bullet — 
which is the item Longhorn E. A. 
most contumeliously refuses to 
face. Adverse ballots He’d let cas- 
cade off him like cottonwood 
balls.” 

A yTeanwhile the wheels of the 
cat-wagon, the hooves of the 
burro and hormoned horse and 
the trotting six horny soles of the 
Mexicans’ feet were carrying us 
past a most interestingly different 
expanse. All metal, glass, and 
plastic were gone. In the distance 
was a veritable forest of tiny hut- 
ments bowered and lined by 
bursts of bright color — flowers, 
it occurred to me with pleased 
surprise. Between them and our 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



street was a crowded city of pas- 
tel homes — pale violet, blue, and 
pink — but too tiny even for 
Mexicans. Then I realized that 
this was a graveyard. 

Between the palety colorful 
homes of the dead was Kobbfing 
toward us. Helped by a long staff, 
a figure robed like myself, but in 
yellow and orange and about five 
feet tall, while his hood Held only 
blackness. My exoskeleton sud- 
denly felt cold to my sack-strited 
skin. I stopped the cat-wagon and 
sat up. 

“Greasertown,” Elmo explained 
succinctly. 

With an effort I forced my eyes 
to scan away from the figure 
which disturbingly field them. 
Ahead, bordered on two sides by 
the cemetery and on one by our 
street and backed by a structure 
of pastel arches I took for a 
church, was an even more colorful 
metal construction consisting of a 
large, round, empty floor ten feet 
off the ground, approached by 
several stairways and shaded by 
a rippling canopy supported 
slim rainbow pillars ten meters 
tall. 

A quick nod frran La Cucara- 
cha told me that my first thought 
was correct — it was the band- 
stand of our evening assignation. 

But the romantic leaping in me 
was chilled as my gaze returned 
to the advancing robed one. I 
still could not discern a face in- 

33 




side the hood. I asked myself if 
it were only the bright sunshine 
making shadows blacker, or if — ” 

“Here comes one of them con- 
samed nigra Zen Buddhists from: 
one of them consamed tidewater 
anarchies — California most like, 
which ;has been predominately 
black ^ver since the assassination 
of Ronald the Third,” Elmo ob- 
served. “Although their Zens are 
troublesome little locos, forever 
ranting and mooching and setting 
themselves afire, we let them wan- 
der freely through Texas out of 
the greatness of our tolerance and 
— ” his voice dropped — “for dip- 
lomatic reasons.” 

Now I could see the slit-eyed, 
anger-contorted, almost inky- 
black face inside the hood. Be- 
cause of intermarriage, such ex- 
treme skin colors have vanished 
from the Sack and even Circum- 
luna. 

Some of my apprehension dis- 
iappeared, but only some. 

tCTe stopped two meters from 
E^l-^-me. Now that he limped no 
longer, but stood only, he gained 
a foot in height, or seemed to. His 
eyelids flew open wide, disclosing 
great orbs of madness, like blood- 
shot moons. An unseen power 
emanated from him and gripped 
me. 

“O white dirt from the sky!” 
he cried gratingly at me. “Arise 
and shoulder your Karma.” 

34 



I nervously cleared my throat. 

Grasping tiis staff two-handed 
by one end, he brought it straight 
down on my head before I could 
think to defend myself. 

My titanium head-basket rang 
with a muffled but sonorous 
bong! I wasn’t hurt, but I was 
jarred, numbed and startled. 

“Arise, I command you! — you 
miserable construct of flesh and 
metal, you abominable offspring 
of ofay and engine,” he growled 
on. “Arise and accept the Great 
Destiny of which you are totally 
unworthy!” And he swung back 
his staff for another basH. I felt 
powerless to defend myself. 

La Cucaracha was kicking her 
burro toward him, but it was El- 
mo’s whip that took him around 
the shoulders. There was a crackle 
and a faint bluish flash, and then 
he was writhing on his back in 
the dirt, shaking his fists and 
gurgling unintelligible words, pre- 
sumably of anger. 

With a most expert flick of the 
same whip, Elmo wound its tip 
around the staff, flipped it toward 
himself, caught it in a hamlike 
hand and pitched it javelinwise 
far into the graveyard. Then the 
whip returned to strike sparks 
from the ground near the twisting 
figure. 

“Vamoose, you nameless son of 
Nirvana, or I declare I’ll grill you 
before you can get out your gaso- 
line to do it yourself!” he roared. 

GALAXY 




The Buddhist scrambled to His 
feet and hobbled off through the 
gravestones with great shoulder- 
bobbings, using a fisted stiff arm 
for staff, but looking back across 
his sullied robes to glare and 
curse, or so it sounded. 

“What was He talking about?” I 
asked in a voice driven by anxiety 
almost baritone-high. 

Elmo shrugged. “OH, those 
hash-blasted Zens always talk 
that way. With them, destinies 
and karmas and ’carnations are a 
penny a peck. Trouble is, they’re 
always banging people over the 
skull — to emphasize their sense- 
less statements, tRey say. Lucky 
you got that Half-Helmet, Scully. 
I’d run the maniac in, except we 
don’t want to waste no time.” 
“A black bee-bonnet, Senor La 
Cruz,” my darling chimed in. 
“Filth beneath your feet. Think 
no more of him.” 

“But How did He know I was 
from space?” 

Once more Elmo shrugged, 
screwing up his big face like a 
giant pepper. “Those nigras got 
odd ways of knowing things, now 
and again,” he admitted. 

“He also knew, despite my 
cloak and hood, that I combined 
metal and flesh.” - 
“That’s true. Maybe there’s 
something here needs watching. 
Kookie, you take Gonzales and 
Company and find out what that 
black bugger’s up to. But don’t 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



nervous him. He really might 
himself afire, though he’s black as 
a cinder already. Then report 
home.” 

“AH ha, I knew it would come!” 
my dear one cried. Her dark eyes 
snapping with anger, real or as- 
sumed. “I knew you would once 
again find an excuse not to take 
me to the Governor’s Ranch. Is 
it that you fear my boldness will 
embarrass you?” 

“Now, Kookie — ” 

“Or is it that you are afraid 
one of higher r ank will demand 
me of you on a trade, and you 
lack spirit to refuse?” 

“Kookie! You hop it now with- 
out no back talk, or I swear I’ll 
ante you up first Hand of my next 
poker game.” 

“Agreed! And they will have to 
send to the girl-shops of Ciudad 
Mexico or New Orleans at least to 
match your bet. Pedro, Pablo, 
Pablitol Vamanos!” 

As she spun Her burro toward 
the graveyard, the three bent- 
backs trotting behind her, she 
spared me one more eye-flash, 
and with three fingers she pitter- 
patted the pleasing bump on the 
Irft side of Her chest, to indicate 
the feelings of the organ beneath. 

IT Imo said to me, “Scully, time’s 
a-wasting. You must Have 
got the Hang of that cat-wagon 
by now, so let’s press a bit.” And 
with that He removed ffis immense 

35 




hat, swung it twice in a circle, 
cried, “Ki-yi-yipeel” and Keeled 
his mount into a gallop. 

Gritting my teeth, which I do 
with great power, I thumbed the 
last go-button at my elbow and 
sped after him, bouncing about a 
bit on ijiy flatbed. As we raced by 
the bandstand neck-and-neck, the 
depression that had gripped me 
from first sight of the orange-5rel- 
low monk now lifted entirely. My 
spirits soared. I would fulfill my 
mission on Terra, yes I — but with 
even greater certainty, memoriz- 
ing the route from now on, I 
would return to the romantically 
hued cemetery tonight at moon- 
rise, even if I had to adapt jets to 
my exoskeleton and compute for 
the first time a gravity-atmos- 
phere parabola! 

A few brown-robed figures 
poured from the church as we 
passed it. Perhaps they thought 
my vehicle was a runaway hearse, 
complete with shrouded corpse, 
and so their responsibility, since 
it fell within their traditional area 
of birth and baptism, confirma- 
tion, marriage, mortal illness and 
death. But we soon outdistanced 
them. -

TV ^y exoskeleton responding to

purring efficiency, I speeded up 
at the last instant and entered tHe 
state-patio of the Governor’s 
ranch Beau Astonishment a long 
stride ahead of Elmo and the 
scuttling bent-back houseboys in 
violet kneepants and lace-trim- 
med, violet jackets, but barefoot 
as Gonzales and Company. These 
came in two converging clusters 
through the greaser doors closely 
flanking the gringo door. 

Then I stopped dead, standing 
perfectly erect, and let them all 
pile up clumsily behind me. I had 
learned how to steal an entrance 
before I ever played Tom Saw- 
yer, Odd John, Jommy Cross, or 
Little Lord Fauntleroy. 

As Elmo began my introduc- 
tion in suddenly subdued and al- 
most faltering tones with a “Gov- 
ernor Cotton Bowie Lamar, your 
honor . and gentlemen . 
other gentlemen,” I ceased listen- 
ing carefully to him and rapidly 
scanned the scene without mov- 
ing an exoskeletal link. 

I was in a spacious area roofed 
by the sky, walled on three sides 
by metal walls four stories high 
and of many colors, and flag- 
toned by an even more rainbow 
jigsaw puzzle of polished miner- 
als, marbles perhaps from many 
quarries, most of the pieces mo- 
saic-smaU. In the flat distance 
were a few trees and many slender 
towers in the form of truncated 
cones. Two of these were five

Lamar, Mlrabeau Buonaparte, I79'8- 
1859, first vice president (1836-38) and 
second president (1838-41) of Texas, a 
poetry-writing, history-bemused, per- 
sonally charming Georgia newspaper 
editor, who arrived in Texas sword in 
hand, inquired his way to Sam Hous- 
ton's little army, and became one of 
the heroes of the battle of San Jacinto, 
April 21, 1.836, where he commanded 
the cavalry. As president he ousted the 
Cherokees and Comanches from the 
infant nation (although Houston was a 
blood-member of the former tribe), 
secured Texas' recognition by Britain, 
France, the Lowlands and the German 
States, guided her through the Pig War 
of 1840, created the piratical Texas 
Navy, set aside vast leagues of land 
for educational and cultural purposes, 
achieved for the Lone Star Republic 
even vaster, credit-building debts, and 
also conceived the goal of Big Texas, 
foreshadowing Lyndon Johnson's Great 
Society.

times the height of the rest, wider 
in proportion and they looked 
much newer. They all cast long, 
late afternoon shadows. 

Beginning in the middle dis- 
tance and ending twenty meters 
away, ^yas a vast rippling rec- 
tangle reflecting the sky’s blue. 
If it were water, there was, I de- 
cided, enough for a lake — far 
more even than in Circumluna’s 
largest swimming-volume. From 
a platform next to it a large, long 
board extended, which made me 
think of pirate tales of “walking 
the plank.” 

But perhaps it was petroleum, 
I reminded myself, unrolling from 
my memory a map of Terra’s re- 
sources, where areas rich in fossil 
animal fats were colored blue. 

Nearer at hand, each occupying 
his own many-pillowed couchlike 
structure with low tables on either 
side, were a half dozen male Tex- 
aps more elegantly or at least 
more neatly clad than Elmo and 
all with noble craggy faces; it was 
as if I had vralked into a quality 
western, circa 1950. (Circum- 
luna’s and the Sack’s microfilmed 
and taped records of Earth’s arts 
are said to be better than those of 
Terra herself.) Like Elmo’s, their 
legs were the heaviest part of 
them — it takes great columns 
indeed to support in six lunagravs 
the mass matching an eight-foot 
height Their gleamingly polished 
boots were vast. 

38 



All held or had beside theni 
glasses of amber fluid, vd^e most 
puffed long reefers — there was 
a scent like plastics under heat- 
treatment. Bent-backs scampered 
about noiselessly, serving and er- 
randing. 

All the recumbent ones radiated 
an aura of power even greater 
than that of physical elegance, 
and all had one or more of the 
behavioral quirks which tradition- 
ally go with power’s possession. 
The nearest held in one half- 
closed hand a stack of gleamingly 
yellow rounds and clinked them 
in waltz time. 

Another of them had insert- 
ed three fingers under his gleam- 
ing white shirt and with them 
was scratching his solar plexus in 
another rhsrthm. A crop-haired 
one had a seven-second facial tic 
which with each convulsion 
threatened to dislodge, but never 
quite did, the large monocle oc- 
cupying his left orbit. Yet, as I 
say, all had matinee-idol profiles, 
circa 1900. 

I noted with approval that as 
they listened to Elmo, their gaze 
was on me. 

Elmo wound up with “. and 
he has large mining interests in 
North Texas,” which irked me 
considerably. The guesser and

XT^ith'out tlie least flourish I 

’ ’ removed my Hooded cloak 
and dropped it on the nearest 
Kouseboy. It covered him totally, 
but I did not pause to note how 
he handled this problem. 

With the least bow, I slowly ro- 
tated my face like a panoramic 
camera from one end of the re- 
cumbent group to the other, 
meanwhile saying in my lowest 
audible voice, resonant with 
nerve-gripping subsonics. “Most 
potent, grave, and reverend sig- 
nors, my very noble and approv- 
ed good masters, I come to you 
bearing greetings from the outside 
universe.” 

(Father had always advised me 
about vanity-mad humans, which 
includes the entire species, terres- 
trial and spatial — even I have 
touches of conceit — “Lay the 
flattery on with a trowel, C^sto- 
pher, and never hesitate to borrow 
from the Bard. He was Iffimself 
the Prince of Borrowers.”) 

I could tell that my deep voice 
and slim, soldierly bearing im- 
pressed them. Sure stage-sense 
had led me to use the lines of 
Venice’s great captain, Othello. 

Next I turned and bowed a tri- 
fle more — but only a trifle — to 
the man who Elmo had first ad- 
dressed. 

“Governor Lamar, your excel- 
lency,” I said, “I bring you the 
especial salutations of Circum- 
luna and the Bubbles Congeries.” 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



(Sack seemed to lack sufficient 
dignity in this situation.) And 
then I eyed him commandingly. 

Almost as if hypnotized (Who 
knows my full powers? — not I), 
the Governor slowly got to his 
feet, meanwhile abstractedly pick- 
ing from his dark coat two bits 
of invisible lint — that was His 
idiosyncrasy. He was the slender- 
est of the lot — which isn’t saying 
a great deal — and by a shade the 
most distinguished looking. 

“Mister La Cruz,” he said, “I’m 
grieved at the inconvenience your 
ill-informed pilot caused you — 
perhaps he understandably as- 
sumed Dallas the port of space 
entry for all points in our vast na- 
tion — but I’m pleased at the 
opportunity of welcoming you to 
Texas, Texas. We see few space 
dwellers, sir, and — ” He broke 
off to capture between finger and 
thumb something unseen on his 
left elbow. 

“And I, sir,” chimed in the 
clinker of gold pieces, copying 
Lamar in rising, “as Atoms Bill 
Burleson, mayor thereof, welcome 
you to Dallas.” His gray-eyed 
gaze wandered up and down me. 
“Pardon me, sir, I mean no of- 
fense, but I’ve never seen a man 
slender as — no, pardon me fur- 
ther, emaciated as yourself and 
still in the land of the living. 
We’ve heard of the terrible tor- 
ttires practiced by the intellec- 
tuality-drunken autocrats of Cir- 

39 




cumluna, from whose tyranny I 
assume you’re in flight, but I 
never guessed that simple starva- 
tion continued for years, nay, 
surely decades — ” 

I silenced him with a lifted 
hand and^toned, “Given energy 
and mass, even of the slightest, to 
manipulate, man can survive in 
any environment, including inter- 
nal ones. Only a minimum of 
muscle and fat is required in sol- 
heated nullgrav or free fall. We 
become Thin or Fats, or maintain 
large muscles by non-grav exer- 
cises, as suits our temperaments 
— asthenic, pyknic, or athletic. I, 
myself, sir, am fairly clearly a 
Thin. But I do not understand 
the mention of tyranny. Circum- 
luna and the Bubbles Congeries 
are a technocratic democracy.” 
“Another of the power-men 
asked me, this one without getting 
up, "We’ve always understood 
that Circum and the Sack were 
inhabited solely by Longhairs. 
Now I’m a plain speaker. Are you 
one of those. Mister La Cruz?” 
This one was the burliest and 
the most burly-le^ed of the lot, 
and his eccentricity was squeezing 
lengthwise between thumb and 
forefinger a black column which 
lengthened to two decimeters or 
shortened to nothing without 
changing diameter — an odd toy, 
but I had his question to reply to. 

“Let my shaven pate be your 
answer. Mister — ?” I saw no 
40 



point in mentioning the shoulder- 
length blond wig in my baggage. 

I eyed him commandingly, but 
with him it didn’t work, at least 
he didn’t rise. 

\ nother of the non-risers broke 
in, the stomacH-scratcHer, 
with whom Elmo, I now noted, 
had been talking privately. “I 
gather you got mining invest- 
ments in North Texas,” he said, 
continuing to scratch, “but who 
are you with, stranger?” 

“I am with myself,” I instantly 
replied with a shrug. “And to be 
sure, I am with Mister Earp 
there, who most kindly befriend- 
ed me at the spaceport.” 

“That’s right, that’s right,” El- 
mo put in hastily and also de- 
fensively. “That’s the truth, sim- 
ple as put-and-take poker.” 

I glared at him. He only stared 
back injuredly, but Lamar at 
least comprehended the meaning 
of my look. 

“Tm sure that none of us in- 
tended to question Mister La 
Cruz’s word,” he said soberly. 
“By the by, I should have intro- 
duced — ” But he broke off to 
flick suspiciously and several 
times with the backs of his fin- 
gernails at an apparently spotless 
area of his knife-pleated trousers. 

“As for those mining invest- 
ments,” I seized the chance to say, 
“I have none. Mr. Earp misinter- 
preted one of my remarks. The 

GALAXY 




matter I Have to settle in Amaril- 
lo CucHillo is purely an old fam- 
ily affair." 

“Of Honor?” Lamar resumed 
softly, a gleam coming into His 
eyes and also into tHose of tHe 
gold-cHinking Burleson. But be- 
fore I could answer, tHe ScratcKer 
again broke in loudly. 

“And you mistook one of my 
meanings, stranger. WKen I asked 
you wHo you was witK, I didn’t 
mean wHo you Had around you, 
or anything complicated like that. 
I just meant who are you with?" 

“I do not think I imderstand 
you,” I said courteously. “WHen? 
Where?” 

“Anywhere. Any time. But 
especially now. Who are you 
with?” 

I looked around somewhat 
helplessly, yet witK a bravely jest- 
ing small smile calculated to win 
the sympathy of any audience. 
“Is it a riddle, gentlemen?” I ask- 
ed at last. 

“It’s no riddle, and you’re just 
making it more complicated,” tHe 
Scratcher retorted almost angrily. 
Then He seemed to take himself 
in hand, and with sucH patience 
as one might bestow on a weak- 
witted child, he said, “Look, I’m 
asking it this way — like, before 
I became Sheriff of Dallas Coun- 
ty, I was with Littleton and La- 
mar Lightning, and before that I 
was with Hunt Espionostics and 
so on. Every male Texan who

amounts to an|''thing is witH sonie 
company, unless he’s a public 
official, in which case He’s wiflS 
the government.” 

“I comprehend,” I said. “I an! 
with — indeed, a featured player 
with — the La Cruz THeater-in- 
the-SpHere Stock Company.” 

“A thespian!” Lamar begad 

warmly. “My daughter will be 
» 

“Stock company!” Burleson ex- 
claimed at the same time, chink- 
ing his gold like the wild clash of 
cymbals. “Mean to say you issue 
shares, debentures, and — ” 

“La Cruz Company!” exclaim- 
ed the one with the black cylin- 
der. “You own this business? I 
know for a fact that on Circum- 
luna total communism — ” 

“Gentlemen!” I politely silenc- 
ed them witH my deepest voice, 
then rapidly explained, “I am in- 
deed an actor, a free-fall Shake- 
spearean. Our company is stock 
only in the old theatrical sense of 
employing stock characters, or 
types, though’ most of us are more 
versatile than that implies. While 
it is my father who owns tHe 
company, though it has coopera- 
tive features and — ” 

“Family business, eh?” 

“Yes,” I told Black Cylinder. 
“And we do have ownership, often 
private, in space. If objects and 
operations are not owned and 
valued, who will care for them? 
Mister — ?”

Once again my hint that full 
introductions would be desirable 
was lost, this time because of the 
last recumbent, the one with the 
monocle. All this while he had 
been watching me with intensest 
interest, like a schoolboy impa- 
tient to redte or demonstrate and 
consti^ntly jiggling about on his 
couch working his features in ad- 
dition to his tic, so that I expected 
it surely each time to disloc^e the 
glass circle which magnified his 
left eye owlishly. 

■NJow, as if obeying an impulse 

^ became irresistible, he 
sprang up and darted toward me, 
violet-clad houseboys altering 
their orbits to clear him a path. 
He stopped in front of me and, 
stooping and rearing, scanned my 
exoskeleton up and down. His fin- 
gers constantly fluttered over it 
without quite touching it; per- 
haps because I folded my arms, 
and stasdng most erect, gave him 
a slight frown. 

“I am extremely interested . 
in metcfuneiy” He said in the en- 
thusiastic but confidential tones 
of one who tells you, “I Have a 
thing about flagellation.” He con- 
tinued, “In particular: prosthetic, 
waldoic, and robotic machinery. 
Oh, beautiful, beautiful! A 
strengtfi-in-delicacy far beyond 
us. WEat lofting! Nature’s own 
skeleton translated to T beams 
. with a thousand improve- 
42 



ments! Such tiny servo-motors, 
yet so clearly powerful! WHaf 
space-saving in battery Housings! 
I take it that without this peer- 
less device you would be . 
completely helpless here?” 

“Yes, even in one lunagrav, let 
alone six,” I admitted, somewhat 
taken off guard by his exclama- 
tions, “Mister — ?” 

He only continued his fantas- 
tical praises with, “And how per- 
fect a twin, or symbiote ratKer, 
your own body is! — as if bred 
to fit this one superb prosthetic 
and no other! Bone and metal in 
a perpetual exquisite embrace or 
communion . .” 

I began to feel too much like a 
starved slavegirl stripped on the 
auction block, so that when he 
actually began to circle behind 
me, I turned so as to continue to 
face him. He speeded up, then 
suddenly reversed, without getting 
in back of me. As this nonsensical 
ballet continued, I began a series 
of calisthenics, knee-bends chiefly 
and head-circlLngs and rapid arm- 
extensions that missed his hair- 
carpeted dome by fractional inch- 
es. He flinched not a whit, sucH 
was his ecstatic concentration. He 
was of German extraction, most 
likely, I decided — which would 
fit the cropped hair and monocle, 
standard stage-indices of the Teu- 
ton. 

Governor Lamar, who had been 
totally absorbed in a most diffi- 

GAIAXY 




cult episode of lint-picking, since 
it involved tHe left shoulder of his 
suit close to his neck, now put a 
stop to our ridiculous pas de deux 
with a, “Professor Fanninowiczl 
Scientific curiosity can come lat- 
er, if our visitor permits. Mister 
Christopher Crockett La Cruz, I 
wish to in'esent to you Professor 
Cassius Krupp Fanninowicz, who 
heads the engineering school at 
UTD.” 

“Charmed!” the professor as- 
sured me, making the word hum. 
But his eyes continued to race 
over my exoskeleton as he very 
lightly pressed my hand, which 
extended bare of metallic or other 
support from my titanium wrist- 
plate. I felt mightily tempted, but 
controlled myself. 

The governor’s gaze began to 
creep toward his right shoulder, 
but with a perceptible effort he 
looked up and continued, “I also 
wish to present to you, sir. Chap- 
arral Houston Hunt, Commander 
in Chief of the Texas Rangers, 
and Big Foot Charlie Chase, 
Sheriff of Dallas,” pointing in 
turn at Black Cylinder and the 
Scratcher. “But Mister — or do 
you prefer Senor? — La Cruz, 
I’ve been remiss in my hospital- 
ities. I’ve sent for my daughter, 
as I wished to present her too, 
but since she’s delayed, would 
you care to recline — ” He indicat- 
ed an empty couch near at hand 
“ — and partake of refreshment? 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



Professor, perhaps you too would 
now be more comfortable on your 
own couch.” 

“Senor suits best,” I said on 
one of my typical impulses, care- 
fully letting myself down onto the 
couch indicated, while Fannino- 
wicz heeded the Governor’s sug- 
gestion, though obviously disap- 
pointed at not being able to wit- 
ness more closely the new bend- 
ings of my exoskeleton. 

“Thank you,” I added to the 
governor, meaning it. Twenty 
minutes on my titanium foot- 
plates had left me suddenly fa- 
tigued. I tongued in my three 
sorts of pills, then almost closed 
my eyes as relaxation hit me — ^ 
except that I saw the governor 
frowning a question at ine. He 
looked toward Elmo, then faintly 
frowned at me again. I hesitated, 
then responded with a slight smile 
and nod. 

“Mr. Earp,” the governor said, 
“you take a couch too — that 
one,” pointing at one outside the 
circle of the rest of us. Elmo 
somewhat shamefacedly gave me 
a quick smile of gratitude as He 
hastened to obey. 

TV iTeanwhile houseboys had 
placed on the table to my 
right a glass of amber fluid 
chinking with ice-cubes and laid 
in a scalloped golden tray on the 
left-hand table a long reefer just 
set a-smolder with' a hot point 

43 




and a clever hand-suction device. 
But before taking either up, I 
once again scanned and sought to 
evaluate the Texans around me. 
The Mexicans could come later 
— there were more of them and 
in any case they seemed at first 
glance as alike as identical twins, 
psychically cyborged if not phy- 
sically. 

The Texans appeared to form 
two chief groups. Governor La- 
mar and Mayor Burleson were 
playing me up. Sheriff Chase and 
Ranger Hunt, despite curt nods 
and curter smiles when they’d 
been introduced to me by Lamar, 
were still putting me down. Why? 
That remained to be discovered. 

Elmo’s role at least was now 
altogether clear to me. He was 
the sort of minor political hanger- 
on who seeks to cadge small re- 
wards, if only food, drinks and 
moments with the great, by in- 
venting favors to do them, such 
as bringing them a stranded 
space-oddity, exactly as he might 
have brought them a wandering, 
halfwitted millionaire or good- 
looking showgirl. Yes, I had El- 
mo’s number, all right, and my 
estimate was confirmed by the 
swiftness with which he latched 
onto a drink and reefer, also send- 
ing one of the houseboys for a 
large plate of appetizers. My feel- 
ing of growing friendliness toward 
him became mingled with a tol- 
erant contempt. 

44' 



Finally, there was the profes- 
sor: seemingly all technical curi- 
osity, which made him the easiest 
first object for the conversational 
attack I now mounted, with the 
intention of truly charming them 
all — the necessary first tactic of 
any traveler in a strange land. 

“Sir,” I said to him, “despite 
your Polish-sounding patron 5 rmic 
— pardon my familiarity — I 
take it you are of German extrac- 
tion, an inheritor of the Teutonic 
scientific genius.” 

“I am indeed!” he responded, 
nodding so vigorously that I 
thought his monocle must surely 
go. “Only in Texas, sir, and the 
adjacent southwest could a Ba- 
varian ever have found a spiritual 
Home away from home. My great- 
great-great-grandfather came ov- 
er with the first V-2’s.” 

“The Atomic War?” I asked 
politely. 

“No, World War Two, not 
Three,” he informed me. “The 
V-2’s lacked atomic warheads — 
my ancestor had a great sorrow 
about that — though' they were 
the first true space vehicles.” 
“Tell me, gentlemen,”- I asked 
around. “How is it that Texas — 
or Texas, Texas rather — escaped 
the atomization which’ I gather 
the rest of North' America en- 
dured?” 

“It was all due to the supreme 
foresight of Lyndon the First and 
his immediate successors,” Mayor 

GALAXY 




Burleson took it on himself to 
explain. “Realizing that this was 
the true heartland of the conti- 
nent, they walled it with anti- 
continental-baUistic-missile mis- 
sile defenses; and drawing on the 
local excavation and drilling skill, 
they filled it with nuclear shelters 
of the deepest and most strongly 
roofed variety, constructing what 
may be called the Texas Bunker, 
though it was then known as the 
Houston Carlsbad Caverns Den- 
ver Kansas-City Little Rock Pen- 
tagram, or maybe Pentagon. A 
step of profound wisdom, Senor 
La Cruz, for which we have rea- 
son to always be eternally grate- 
ful.” 

“So that when the Atomic War 
finally came,” Professor Fannino- 
wicz took up with an excitement 
almost gleeful (Now the monocle 
must surely go!), “Russia, China, 
France, England, Black Africa, 
my own tormented and divided 
nation, and the outworks of the 
Texas Bunker were shattered, 
mangled, tattered! — while here 
snugly survived the virile spirit of 
Assyria, Macedon, Rome, Bavar- 
ia, and the brave Boers!” Now at 
last a tic coincided with a near 
screech and the monocle did pop 
out, though rather disappointing- 
ly he caught it deftly in his left 
hand and whipped it instantly 
back into its proper orbit, where 
it gleamed as brightly as his bared 
white teeth. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



T meanwhile had taken the first 
of the three sips I allow my- 
self of an alcoholic beverage — a 
small sip, for the drink was strong 

— and inhaled two puffs of mari- 
juana vapor, a smoke I had never 
before sampled. It seemed mild 
stuff, but I soon began to feel a 
lofty well-being, despite the grisly 
things being told me, and the 
scene and sounds around and 
about me began to organize them- 
selves symphonically, even the 
chinking of Mayor Burleson’S 
coins fitting perfectly into the 
great rhythm. At first, I must 
admit, there was something sin- 
ister about the tiny tympanic tune 
of power-men releasing tension: 
TIC . clink, clink . scratch- 
scratch . squeeze, squeeze . , . 
faintest plink of thumb and fin- 
gertip on captured lint-speck . 
TIC! But swiftly even these noises 
became orchestrated into a bliss- 
ful totality. 

Mayor Burleson said, “Senor 
La Cruz, I don’t doubt you come 
from space — in fact, I can’t, see- 
ing that handsome contraption 
you need to get around in gravity 

— but your middle name and 
height make me think you’re ori- 
ginally a Texan who got the hor- 
mone. Now that hormone’s a 
closely-guarded secret, sir — the 
lower orders of society and the 
rest of the world haven’t grown 
up enough yet to be trusted with 
bigness — and we wouldn’t like to 




think of it being known to the 
Longhairs of Circumiuna.” 

I said in words dreamy and 
poetic, yet perfectly enunciated 
and of course still very deep- 
pitched, “I may well indeed be of 
Texan ancestry. There can be no 
certainty about it, for my grand- 
father ' lifted to the Sack from 
Spani^' Harlem in New York 
City, yet my middle name whis- 
pers its hint, and the lines of here- 
dity are as m3rsteriously inter- 
woven as the curves of the clouds 
now gathering above us to en- 
chant our gaze. But as for your 
last fear. Mayor, set your mind 
at rest. In free fall, unconfined by 
gravity, human growth is freer 
and sometimes almost fantastical. 
My grandfather was tall and slen- 
der, my father more so, and I 
still more so. My mother too is 
of considerable length, though' it 
is her pleasure to be a Fat.” 

The whole scene around me, 
though darkening toward sunset, 
presented itself to me with super- 
normal clarity, each detail a gem. 

I took another small sip of my 
drink, but returned the reefer to 
its tray — a little of that stuff 
was enough for my attenuated 
physiology, as with most drugs. 
My feelings had reached a har- 
monious acme, why spoil it? I 
felt marvelously relaxed and at 
peace. I placed a titanium heel 
atop a titanium toes-guard, in ef- 
fect crossing my legs for comfort 
46 



as I noted several of my com- 
panions had done, and contin- 
ued, “Yet I feel greatly at home 
here, a Texan in spirit if not in 
fact. You are no longer my hosts, 
but my dear friends. Senor La 
Cruz is all very well, but I would 
be happier if you called me Chris 
— or perhaps Scully, the name 
Mr. Earp bestowed on me from 
my cadaverousness.” 

“That’s fine, Scully, call me 
Atoms,” Burleson responded. 
However, I noted the Command- 
er, the Sheriff, and the Professor 
bristled almost imperceptibly — 
my senses were vastly acute at 
the moment — and gave the 
Mayor slightly dark looks, a pale 
shade of gray, while the Governor 
was moodily absorbed watching 
a houseboy wipe his gleaming 
boots with a white pocket hand- 
kerchief he’d given him. I deter- 
mined to charm them in spite of 
themselves and at that moment 
remembered an anecdote. 

I took the third sip of my drink 
and firmly set it down. “Gentle- 
men,” I said somewhat sharply, 
“Whatever I am in fact, I feel 
myself a Texan at this moment, 
sharing your expansive relaxation, 
your wide wisdom, your tolerance, 
your homely but Huge humor. 
May I tell you a story?” 

I was pleased to note that it 
was the Governor who gave me 
the nod. It had been to rouse him 
that I’d spoken sharply. 



GALAXY 




CtTT^Hen time was young,” I 
» ' said, speaking softly, 
“God was sitting by a mud pud- 
dle, dabbling His hngers in tHe 
dirty water and playing witK tKe 
mud. Because, you see, all things 
were young then and even God 
was a youth. Think of him as 
Ometecutli, the Papa-God of tKe 
Mexicans, but not yet a papa, 
only a young and stocky barefoot 
sun-tanned God in ragged pants, 
pla3dng like the village loco in a 
universe of water and clay, of 
love and flowers. 

“First he made balls of the clay 
and pitched them out and up so 
that they went spinning round 
and round, forever. So he created 
the sun, the moon, the planets 
and the whole great universe. 

“After a while he grew tired of 
this sport. Looking into the mud- 
puddle, He saw for the first time 
his reflection. 'I will make some- 
thing like that,’ He said. 

“So he made of clay the figure 
of a man, giving him a coat and 
shoes, for God was poor then and 
thought such things very fine, and 
making his hair very short, for 
at the moment God was a novice 
sculptor, and curls and such were 
beyond Him. 

“Tfien He chanced to breathe on 
the figure as he was admiring it 
closely. To his amazement, the 
instant his breath struck the fig- 
ure, it stood up on the palm of 
His Hand and began to marcH

about there, doing a goose-step.” 

Smiling gently at Professor 
Fanninowicz, I continued, “See- 
ing this, God said to himself, ‘AH- 
ha, a little German,’ and he reacE- 
ed out and set down the figure ill 
Germany. 

“Next God made a woman. He 
gave her a long skirt and long 
wavy hair — for God was gaining 
skill now — ; and he put a KigK 
comb in her hair. He breathed 
upon her, and she stood up and 
began to sing most beautifully. 
‘Ah-ha, a little Italian,’ he said 
to himself, and he set her down 
in Italy. 

“Thus God made the EngUsE- 
men, the Frenchman, the Rus- 
sian, the Negro, the Hindu, lEe 
heathen Chinee and almost all 
other breeds of Earth. 

“God was growing somewhat 
tired now, and his supply of clay 
was getting low, so to speed things 
up he made two male figures at 
once, giving them only his own 
simple garb. When he breatfied 
upon them, they sprang up in- 
stantly and began to fight with 
each other. ‘Two little Mexicans,' 
God said, putting them down in 
Mexico. 

“He had not quite enough' clay 
left for two more figures, so to 
finish His task — for althougE a 
loco, God was a conscientious 
worker and wasted nothing — fie 
made and dressed one great tall 
figure. This still left him witfi 

47 




^me clay, so he made a great 
wide-brimmed hat for the figure 
and chaps for its legs and fine 
boots. Two small dabs of clay 
were left, so he used them to give 
the boots high heels. Two more 
dabs of, clay of the tiniest were 
still left, and so that nothing 
might be lost, God made of them 
spurs for the boots. ' 

“He breathed on the figure. 
Nothing happened. God was 
startled. Had He made a mistake? 
Perhaps the magic did not work 
for large figures. Yet he breathed 
on the figure again, much Harder. 

“God thought he saw the figure 
stir a little. So He drew a deep 
breath and blew fiercely on the 
figure. His breath was like a gale 
or a tornado. 

“The figure only pulled the 
brim of his great hat down over 
His eyes and crossed his boots 
and, linking his hands behind his 
neck, began to snore there where 
he lay on God’s palm. 

“God became very angry. He 
drew in a tremendous breath, 
puffed out his cheeks and breath- 
ed upon the figure that was like 
a hurricane of hurricanes, like the 
shock wave of an atomic bomb! 

“Without stirring otherwise at 
all, the figure pushed back His Hat 
from his face and, looking God 
straight in the eye, demanded, 
*Who the Hell do you think you’re 
spittin’ at?’ ” 

The laughter which greeted this 
48 



tale gratified me. Even Chaparr^ 
Houston Hunt grinned and 
pounded his leg. 

B efore the applause had faded, 

I said loudly to them all, 
though I made a point of looking 
at Lamar, “So it was in the be- 
ginning, and so it still appears to 
be true of that great land stretch- 
ing from Nicaragua to the North- 
west Territory. Speaking of the 
latter, I trust I will have your aid 
in joume3ring to Amarillo Cuchil- 
lo tomorrow.” 

“Whatever you want, Scully!” 
To my surprise, it was Sheriff 
Chase who first answered. “Oh, 
that tale took us Texans off to 
perfection.” 

“Ask anything, Scully!” Again 
to my surprise, it was Comman- 
der Hunt who seconded. Elmo 
was standing beside him. “Sure 
you don’t want to leave tonight? 
— though we’ll hate to lose you. 
Of course, we could have a round 
of partying first.” 

“Tomorrow would be best,” I 
replied, thinking of La Cucaracha. 
“And as for partying, I thank you 
from heart’s bottom, yet I fear 
this one will be all I can take. 
Although my exoskeleton is tire- 
less even in Earth-grav, my bone 
one and its envelope are not. It 
will be best for me if I spend the 
night in lonely quiet and rest.” I 
was seeking to set up a situation 
in which it would be easy for me 

GALAXY 




to make my sneak back to the 
cemetery. 

And I didn’t Have too much 
time, come to think of it. The sun 
had already set and moonrise 
would come but two hours later. 
To one who lives in space near 
Luna, keeping track of Earth’s 
phases is second nature. She is 
our month-clock. 

“Not altogether lonely, I hope, 
Senor La Cruz — ho-ho, the Ger- 
man put down in Germany, very 
funny — ” Professor Fanninowicz 
boomed at me heartily, “ — for I 
hope to spend the night at your 
side, studying your magnificent 
exoskeleton and perhaps experi- 
menting — ” 

“Senor La Cruz shall spend his 
time as he sees fit,’’ Governor La- 
mar cut in with authority. “The 
first demand of hospitality is con- 
sideration for — ” 

He broke off to get to his feet 
and turn toward the Gringo Door. 
The other men copied him. I 
could see without turning, but 
just the same I got up as rapidly 
as possible. 

Since landing on Terra, I had 
experienced three great liftings of 
spirit. The first had been La Cu- 
curacha. The second, marijuana. 
The third was the slender, statu- 
esque female we now faced. 

Oh, I didn’t forget La Cucara- 
cha in the least, and I remained 
as firmly determined as before to 
be beside her at moonrise. But 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



now, suddenly illumined by the 
sun’s silvery afterglow from the 
clouds above, there was a gor- 
geous counterattraction. 

She was nearly as tall as I and 
of Junoesque proportions, buf 
compared with the male Texans 
she was slender. She wore Grecian 
robes of a pale silvery silk whicli 
left an ample area of alabaster 
shoulders and bosom bare and fell 
in perfect folds to the floor. I Bad 
never seen the like, even on stage 
— one simply cannot achieve that 
wonderful classic draping without 
gravity to help. 

Her face was at the moment 
grave and mystic, though subtly 
seductive. A youthful Athena 
Artemis, rather than Aphrodite. 
In one pale hand she held a scroll 
with silver knobs. 

Her platinum-blonde Hair was 
piled high. Tiny lights winked in 
it. Under her arching brows, her 
pale blue eyes were fixed on mine. 
For a second time on Terra I Had 
lost my heart — something my 
father tells me a young man can’t 
do too often, provided it doesn’t 
interfere with rehearsals and Be 
never misses an entrance or a cue. 

ttQenor Christopher La Cruz,” 
Governor Lamar said, “I 
wish to introduce to you my dear 
daughter, the Honorable Rachel 
Vachel Lamar. Sugar, I’ve been 
waiting for you quite a while.” 

“Hush up, Daddy,” the goddess 

49 




said, wrinkling that delectable 
nose in a miffy grin. “To honor 
our guest properly I had to dart 
into my Diana costume — she’s 
the Roman moon goddess, Daddy 
— and then I had to snatch’ time 
to dash off a poem of greeting. 
I’ll reac^'it now, if aH you verse- 
scorning menfolk don’t mind.” 

Then without pausing to note 
whether they did, she struck a 
pose that I Had to admit was most 
amateurish (but the more delight- 
ful for that) and recited in an elo- 
cution-school voice that occasion- 
ally squeaked and/or went husky 
and invariably found the worst 
spots to suck in an over-obvious 
breath (yet how it all stole the 
heart!) ; 

Ho, traveler from outer spacel 
How swell to tee your sunk-cheek face, 
Your somber form that's flagstaff-lrim, 
Your flashing eye and sword-slim limb, 

She must Have got an earlier 
glimpse of me, I realized, perhaps 
from an upstairs window, embow- 
ered like a Moslem maiden. The 
poem continued: 

We've gazed at your abode for years 
Serene o'er earthly |oys and tears. 

It sails the sky without a sound 
A million miles above the ground. 

We never thought we'd get a chance 
To hold a moon man in our glance. 
But here you've dropped out of the blue 
And all of Texas welcomes yeui 

The other men applauded po- 
litely, Elmo fortissimo. As she 
50 



moved forward toward stage-cen- 
ter — a little too fast and coltisU 
for a goddess, but just right for a 
girl — I swiftly intercepted her, 
caught hold of her hand and bow- 
ed over it, pressing it briefly to 
my lips. 

Then as I stood “flagstaff-trim” 
again, holding her hand a moment 
longer, I said, “Miss Lamar, I 
never have been so moved since 
when clutched in the arms of my 
mother, who was doubling as a 
member of the mob, I first heard 
my father give Antony’s oration.” 

It was borderline truth, though 
I had been moved in different 
ways. My father had terrified me 
in that black toga. 

“Go on, you flatterer, you,” she 
giggled, giving me a playful sHove 
that sat me back on my titanium 
heelplates. 

Then her eyes got big. “Your 
pa’s an actor?” They got bigger 
still. “You’re an actor too — you 
stayed one?” 

I shrugged. “Oh an occasional 
Hamlet, Peer Gynt, Orestes, Cy- 
rano . .” 

I could have sworn that for an 
instant she was going to hug me. 
Instead she looked me up and 
down, grinned and said, “I bet 
you overlapped your ma to either 
side when she clutched you.” 

“Yes and she wrinkled her nose 
too,” I countered. “I wet msrself.” 

Governor Lamar said, “My col- 
leagues and I have a bit of busi- 

GALAXY 




ness to finisU discussing before 
dinner. Senor La Cruz, I imagine 
you and my daughter can enter- 
tain each’ other for the while. You 
appear to have interests in com- 
mon.” 




RACHEL VACHEL 
(t'^ell me some more, Captain 
Skull. But let me light 
you another reefer.” 

“Thank you, princess. But per- 
haps you will tell me something 
for a change. Wh’at is moths?” 
“Furry' butterflies.” 

“What is . are butterflies?” 
“Butterflies is — OH, thesr’re 
like two tiny swatches of batik or 
embroidery flappin’ along. And 
you’ll likely be seeing a few moths 
in a few minutes for yourself. We 
even got lunar ones in honor of 
your homeland. Go on talkin’ 
theater of space — ” 

“Very well, princess. Yes, acting 
in three dimensions in free fall has 
its special techniques and requires 
its special conditions. For in- 
stance, upstage lies in all direc- 
tions from stage-center, but so 
does down-stage. You must learn 
to favor all sections of the audi- 
ence by rotation in at least two 
planes, and that requires motivat- 
ed or surreptitious contact with 
the other actors on stage. Also, to 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



make an exit, you must take off 
from another actor or preferably 
several, and there should be a 
counterbalancing entrance — un- 
less you use an air jet or are 
drawn off by fine-wire, devices we 
try to avoid. Ideally, 3D nulgrav 
acting becomes dramatic ballet 
with dialogue. Tffink of Don Juan 
in Hell, the actors afloat, or of 
Antony’s oration again, with the 
mob a ragged sphere between the 
orator and the larger sphere of the 
audience.” 

“Oh, it all sounds so excitin’ — 
makes our little theater here seem 
positively earthbound, even 
though Daddy insists on spending 
millions on lighting and special 
effects and sets. Sometimes a heap 
too much of those; we wanted to 
do Out Town the right way but 
Daddy insisted on building us a 
real town with the smallest House 
big as the Petit Trianon. We ac- 
tors were positively lost among 
those gingerbread skyscrapers. 
And I had to bust into tears sev- 
enteen times before he’d drop his 
plan to build us a life-size, prac- 
tical, moving glacier for Skin of 
Out Teeth.” 

“The last time we put on Out 
Town, princess, we used only six 
kitchen chairs borrowed from the 
Circumluna Museum of Terran 
Domestic Artifacts — all floating, 
of course, as I mentally float 
now.” 

“OH, spit I I might Have known. 

51 



But do go on, Captain Skull, 
please.” 

Our “interests in common” Kad 
indeed drawn the Honorable Ra- 
chel VacKel and me closer togeth- 
er, and in less than ten minutes. 
Our princess-Captain Skull per- 
sonae derived from Her conceit 
that I was Sir Francis Drake re- 
porting the unknown lands of the 
Pacific to a youthful Queen Eliza- 
beth. We were seated side-by-side 
in the gracious dusk on a large 
couch’ facing the dark horizon 
with its mysterious truncated 
cones across the very faintly 
shimmering ripples of the vast 
swimming pool (Rachel Kad iden- 
tified that for me and assured me 
it was water), and we were quite 
alone. My companion Had shooed 
out all the Mexican Houseboys 
shortly after Her father’s depar- 
ture. 

I was still determined to keep 
my date with La CucaracKa — 
after all, she seemed the eartffier 
and more easily Kad of the twain 
— but at the moment I was steal- 
ing my left arm along the top of 
the couch behind Rachel VacHel’s 
ivory shoulders and also an occa- 
sional eye-wander down Her deli- 
cious frontal decolletage. 

tCVjl^ilder is one of our minor 
^ ” favorites among the old 
playwrights,” I meanwhile con- 
tinued. “He rouses and satisfies 
simply and beautifully our nos- 
52 



talgia for Terra. Other old ones 
often in our repertory are Ibsen, 
Bergman (we live-stage fiis 
films), Shaw, WycKerly, Moliere, 
Euripedes, Gorky, Chekhov, 
Brecht, Shakespeare of course, 
and — ” 

“Hush, you’re maltin’ me drool 
green with envy I Our group’s for- 
ever tT3dn’ to stage real serious 
plays like Macbeth or Pillars of 
Society or The Gods of the Light- 
ning or Waitin’ tor Lefty or Man- 
hattan Project or Frisco After the 
Fallout or Uncle Tom’s Cabin or 
Intolerance (let Daddy use Kis 
hundred millions live-stagin’ that, 
I say) or Streetcar . but — 
wouldn’t you know it? — Daddy’s 
forever insistin’ on another revival 
of Oklahoma, callin’ it Texiana, 
of course, and usin’ Corpus Chris - 
ti or Texarkana ’stead of Kansas 
City, to make it scan, and five 
times out of six Daddy gets his 
way. And even then He won’t let 
me play Ado Annie, the Cain’t- 
say-no girl — always got to have 
some little Mex on stilts for that 
part.” 

Edging my arm a little closer, 
I remarked, “Your father seemed 
to me a most courteous and mild 
gentleman.” 

“Mild? Huh! You should see 
him when — ” 

In turning to make Her com- 
ment she had suddenly leaned 
back against my slithering arm. 
Now with a little scream she bent 

GALAXY 




forward, quickly turning tier head 
to remark, “My, that skeleton of 
yours is awfully chilly. Captain 
Skull. Can’t you take it off even 
for a little while, while you’re on 
Earth?” 

“To my great regret, no,” I in- 
formed her. “Without it, I liter- 
ally could not move an arm or leg 
or lift my head. While a fall, espe- 
cially without exoskeletal protec- 
tion, might easily fracture a limb 
or my skull. I have just begun to 
realize that when one is eight and 
a Half feet tall, one has a lot of 
farther to fall in gravity than — ” 

“Don’t explain to me about 
that. I’m eight foot two myself, 
and I know all about chipped and 
busted bones. Well, we can’t have 
you fracturing yourself, that’s for 
sure, you spacemen are too pre- 
cious, so . .” she gave a small 
sigh of resignation , I guess I 
just got to endure the chilliness,” 
and she flopped herself back 
against my arm before I could 
have withdrawn it, had I intended 
to. 

She turned her face toward 
mine. Amid the mists of her plati- 
num hair, her eyes were dark 
pools of wonder in which the stars 
glimmered faintly. 

“Anything for Texas — that’s a 
joke,” she said. “Go on. Captain 
Skull, tell me some more.” 

“But there are many things I 
would like you to tell me, chiefly 
about yourself,” I countered, 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



carelessly draping my free hand 
across my knee so that it happen- 
ed lightly to touch one of hers. 
She did not move that leg. “I 
know you are a poet,” I said. 
“Are you by any chance also a 
playwright?” 

“OH, I got a little old script or 
two in a secret compartment- in 
my lingerie drawer,” she admitted 
nonchalantly. “But don’t for 
world's whisper a word about 
them to Daddy. One of them’s 
called Houston's Afire, and an- 
other Storm over El Paso." 

“I also would guess that you 
are named for a poet,” I contin- 
ued. “Vachel Lindsay.” 

“My, you’re brilliant. Captain 
Skull, I never dreamed anyone on 
Earth, let alone in the sky, re- 
membered ansrthing about that 
little old Chinese Niihtingate or 
General Booth.” 

“Rachel Vachel,” I said, lean- 
ing toward her, “the first poem of 
any length my father ever taught 
me was The Congp. That is, after 
Chesterton’s Lepanto.” 

“Recite Lepanto!” she com- 
manded me, but before I could 
utter “White founts falling . .,” 
she countermanded that with, 
“No, don’t! Daddy and His crew’ll 
be back any minute, and that 
poem’s too long, much as I’d be 
ravished by it. Lemme think.” 

< t "D acHel Vachel,” I asked, as 
my free fingers lightly 
53 




walked up tKe silvery silk draping 
her thigh', “tKere is an aspect of 
the landscape puzzles me — tKe 
many conical towers.” 

“Oh those!” she said impatient- 
ly. “Those are just oilwells. 
Grandpa insisted on keeping tKe 
derricks for sentimental reasons, 
but Grandma thought tKey were 
unaesthetic and made Kim cover 
them up with those antimacassar 
lighthouses, I call ’em. Antima- 
cassars were originally doilies to 
keep hair-oil off chair backs, you 
know. I’d rather the naked der- 
ricks again — be Konester.” 
“And the two very much larger 
and newer towers?” I continued. 
It is sometimes effective, I think, 
to talk of irrelevant matters while 
moving closer to a female. Be- 
sides, I have a curiosity which 
operates simultaneously on all 
levels, and when the sexual is 
awakened, all the others are too. 
“Only two much larger oilwells?” 
“Fact is, I don’t know the an- 
swer to that myself,” Rachel Va- 
chel said, anger in her voice. 




“When they built them six 
months ago, I asked Daddy, but 
he put me off with His stand- 
ard lecture about Kow women 
shouldn’t interest themselves in 
science and technology, but cul- 
ture and religion only. I tried to 
ride out to them a couple times, 
but got turned back.” Suddenly 
she sat up straight, though clap- 
ping a hand over my free one, 
which had reached Her waist. Now 
her voice was entirely exasperated 
anger on the verge of tears. “Oh, 
Captain Skull! You don’t know 
how Daddy strangulates me, hid- 
in’ a whim of patriarchal Texan 
iron under all that suffocatin’ 
courtliness and courtesy. I’m sup- 
posed to get bowed to and stood 
up for and my feminine mystique 
done reverence, at the price of 
limitin’ my activities to silly little 
poems and reproductions of Ok- 
lahoma and Babes in Toyland 
and The Wizard of Oz with a 
Texas ’stead of a Kansas Dorothy 
— yes, and of bein’ bossed around 
like a nine-year-old! Honest, 
some days I wish I could die!” 
That outburst over, she instantly 
flopped back against my left arm, 
throwing her own right arm over 
it to keep it from stra}dng, as if 
it would, and leaning Her lovely 
white-misted head against it so 
that she could dark-wonder me 
even more effectively with' her 
glimmering eyes. 

“Go on, tell me some more,” 



55 



she mxirmured meltingly. “Tell 
me some more about acting in the 
Sack.” She sighed softly, at least 
for a young woman eight foot 
two, and added wistfully, “I sup- 
pose all you actors up there are 
stars, just like the ones twinklin’ 
above us now.” 

“Far^from it, princess,” I told 
her, my left hand beginning to 
feather-stroke Her bare shoulder 
and my right Hand resuming its 
tiptoe journey. “Our situation is 
far more like that of any Shake- 
sperean or later actors in puritan- 
ic Northern Europe and America 
before the Twentieth-Century 
deification of entertainers. We are 
no better than strolling players — 
worse, because with’ vacuum out- 
side we have nowhere to stroll 
when things get hot for us. We 
are given no special honor by our 
fellow Sackabonds, and at times 
we are denotmced and threatened 
by Circumluna’s scientists, engi- 
neers and technicians, on whose 
continuing ticket-buying, none- 
theless, we depend for the essen- 
tials of life. In that sense we are 
much like the artists of the Ren- 
aissance, dependent on the pa- 
tronage of their individual princes 
— our prince being the Circum- 
lunan Establishment. Him we 
must please, or starve, and the 
former is as difficult as the latter 
is easy.” 

“ ‘Renaissance’ is just the word 
I was looking for to describe 
56 



you!” Rachel interrupted. “You’re 
like one of those tall, thin, som- 
ber-lookin’, small steppin’ Span- 
ish Grandees — the kind that 
wear great cloaks and hats with 
black plumes and are deadly 
duelists. You fence and duel, by 
any chance?” 

“Those were among my first 
accomplishments,” I contented 
myself with saying. I was tempt- 
ed to give her a demonstration 
which might have surprised her, 
but it would have interrupted our 
passage toward togetherness, so I 
stifled my vanity. 

“I might have known, you be- 
in’ an actor,” she said. “Go on 
about those Longhairs you put 
on your plays for.” 

tt^'T^he scientists, yes. Well, you 
see, princess, they began 
over a hundred years ago as — 
and have continued to be — quite 
rigid, asthetically puritanic types. 
They greatly need the catharsis 
we give them with’ our dramas — 
everything from high tragedy to 
low comedy — but there are al- 
ways those among them whose 
violent, temporarily uncatharsiz- 
ed desires, masquerading as high 
scientific conscience, demand our 
muzzling and even our expulsion. 
They accuse us of great sexual 
laxity, thievery, political and so- 
cial irresponsibility, corrupting 
the morals of the young, and dir- 
ty personal Habits such as not

Tell me, do you consider me one 
of the young? I mean as far as 
corruptin’ morals is concerned. 
Don’t answer that one, just keep 
it up — talldn’ too.” 

I continued, “At present the 
puritanic faction of Circumlun- 
ans, composed somewhat more of 
those of Russian heritage than 
those of Americo-West European 
extraction, is in the ascendency. 
With the lifting of the Interdict, 
they are demanding that not only 
we actors, but all Sackabonds not 
doing vital part-time technologi- 
cal work for Longhairs be deport-

of Circumlunans don’t want this 
at all — we’re almost their sole 
source of fun and frenzy — but 
being respectable bourgeois tech- 
nocrats to a man (and a woman) 
nearly, they daren’t speak out 
against the highly vocal h5TJer- 
puritanic minority. The only solu- 
tion for us, of course, is the age- 
honored one of buying off the 
Establishment with Circumlun- 
an-acceptable cash — meaning

it difficult if not impossible to 
S3mthesize. It’s to win that cash 
to defend from deportation all 
Sackabonds, but in particular the 
personnel and properties of the 
La Cruz Th'eater-in-the-Sphere, 
that I’ve come down to earth, 
Rachel Vachel.” 

I could feel her quiver with 
new excitement under my fingers. 
“You mean, you’re goin’ to put on 
shows down here to raise funds? 
No, don’t stop what you’re doin’. 
Remember, you got your reputa- 
tion for great sexual laxity to 
maintain and I got my Daddy 
to spite. But in that case why not 
star with the Dallas Little The- 
ater, with the title role in Death 
Takes a Holiday for a starter? 
I’m sure I could swing it, and 
Daddy’s got pots!” 

“Alas, Princess, the doctors as-

stant exoskeletal support and 
large periods of rest, I dare not 
stay more than a week on Terra, 
or at a risky most, two^ without 
suffering large permanent phsrsio- 
logical damage. They expressly 
warned me against — ” 

I cut off that one quick, and 
the thought behind it too. Among 
the activities against which they 
had expressly warned me was the 
one in which I was now engaged, 
and I didn’t want to start ques-

“I’ll tell you a secret, Rachel 
VacKel,” I said, my rumble some- 
what thick as she was riiivering 
three fingers, thrust between my 
tit am um exo-ribs, across my 
chest WKat the devil, I’d already 
told her far more than I’d in- 
tended — I might as well, as El- 
mo would have put it go it whole 
hog. “Before my grandfather lift- 
ed from Spanish Harlem, He had 
bought from a down-and-out 
Aleutian prospector a mining 
claim to an area near Yellow- 
knife, Canada. 1 mean Amarillo 
Cuchillo, North Texas. This claim 
was supposedly worthless, but the 
Aleutian who had bought it from 
a Cree Indian Had investigated 
the area closely and discovered 
that within it lay the Lost Crazy- 
Russian Pitchblende Mine, and he 
had drawn a map of the mine’s 
exact location. My father treas- 
ured the claim and the map as 
an ace in the hole to revive the 
La Cruz fortunes in time of trou- 
ble. They were useless during the 
Interdict, but now that that’s over 
and the time of trouble come for 
us and the entire Sack, my father 
Has sent me down to sell the claim 
or seize the profits if someone else 
has meanwhile discovered it and 
been working it -illegally.”

“My, yovir pa must be quite a 
... a dreamer, Scully,” Rachel 
VacHel murmured languidly. 
"That sounds to me just like the 
million and one Lost Dutchman 
Gold Mines down in Mexico, Tex- 
as. Oh, but I’m dead sure it’s go- 
ing to work out fine in your case,” 
she Hastened to add. Then, the 
dark-wondering peaking in her 
eyes, “Kiss me, Scully.” 

Carefully tilting my head so 
neither my titanium jaw-sHelf nor 
cheek plates would touch Her, I 
planted my lips on Hers. Her 
hands moved on my back be- 
tween titanium T spine and exo- 
rib lattice. We kissed for some 
time with small moans. Then she 
broke away with a slightly bigger 
one, in which I Heard faintly the 
whispered words, “Come sweet 
death . .” and her voice returned 
to medium brisk as she asked, 
“You didn’t leave the claim and 
map in your luggage, I hope? 
Daddy’s sure to have that snoop- 
ed, ’scoped and espioned.” 

“But surely your father is too 
honorable and courtly and gen- 
teel — ” 

“Oh, He’s the genteelest jail 
warden in all Texas, Texas. Why 
do you suppose I Have secret 
compartments in my lingerie 
drawers? If he could only see 
right now — You know, Scully, 
we must be making a most excit-' 
ing scene: a Greek goddess bein’ 
elegantly seduced by a romanti-

cal black-and-silver skeleton, the 
matin’ of the mantis with the june 
bug — just the kind of ' scene 
Daddy’ll never let us stage in our 
plays, the courtly old Cromwell! 
Where have you got the claim 
and the map, Scully? You didn’t 
forget and leave them up there 
in the sky, I hope?” 

“I keep them on my person, 
princess.” 

“That’s nice,” she murmured, 
gently stroking same. “Say, Scul- 
ly, what’s your impression of the 
Mexican situation down here? I 
mean seriously — no, you keep it 
up too — and truly. Answer hon- 
est, now.” 

“I hope this doesn’t offend you, 
Rachel, but my answer must be: 
deeply disturbing. The childish 
and superficially Hiomorous servi- 
tude of your Spanish Americans, 
I mean Spanish Texas, I find dis- 
gusting. And those cybernetic 
yokes — abominable!” 

“That’s interesting,” she mur- 
mured. “Now what’s your atti- 
tude on revolution? No, keep it 
up.” 

T must admit that her rapid and 

startling questions were put- 
ting me off stride a bit, like one- 
two punches, no matter how well 
they confonned to my own phil- 
osophy of all curiosities satisfied 
simultaneously. But I gathered 
my forces and carried on, on both 
levels.

“Revolution in Circumluna and 
the Sack? No. Except for the 
Longhairs’ puritanic blind spot, 
we are all too intelligent for it up 
there. Besides, we are too deeply 
interdependent, and the Longhairs 
hold all the^'cards. Down here? I 
don’t know. From what little I’ve 
seen of them, hoping for a Mexi- 
can revolution would be like ex- 
pecting a revolt of the babies. 
Emotionally I sympathize great- 
ly with revolution. I identify. 
Among my most favorite roles 
are Cassius, Dr. Stockman in An 
Enemy of the People, Danton, 
Lord Byron, Lenin, Sam Adams, 
Fidel Castro, John Brown, and 
Ho Chi Minh.’’ 

“Oh I can just see you as Cas- 
sius. You got that ‘lean and h’lm- 
gry’ look to perfection. You’re 
going to devour little Rachel, 
aren’t you? Go Waltzing-Matilda 
with her? Promise? Or Ho too — 
you have the Dr. Fumanchu 
touch: ‘Beware, America! You 
got your napalm and atomic 
bombs, but I got my black scor- 
pions, my giant centipedes, my 
spiders with diamond eyes that 
wait in the dark, then leap!’ Gol- 
ly! Or maybe I could work up a 
drama around that legendary 
figure of El Esqueleto — you’d be 
gteat as him. Say, there’s an ideal 
But Daddy — oH forget it. Look 
here, dear, I admit I’m getting a 
fetish about that skeleton of 
yours but couldn’t you get out of 
60 



it for just a little while? Mayn’t 
you be underestimating your un- 
mechanized strength? Your hands 
feel so strong on my funny 
bumps.’’ 

I was deeply moved at that, I 
must confess. For some reason I 
could now see more plainly again 
my lovely eight-foot-two pale 
goddess in her artistically disar- 
ranged robes. A mjrsterious silver 
light bathed her and made me ut- 
terly reckless. 

“Look, darling,” I whispered 
breathily and rapidly, “If we’re 
careful it’s not necessary that 
I—” 

I do not know what would have 
happened next, or rather I know 
exactly what would have happen- 
ed next, and a disaster to have 
missed it, or more likely a disas- 
ter to have enjoyed it . any- 
how, Rachel Vachel pushed me 
away with a sharply whispered, 
“They’re coming back!” I heard 
the footsteps myself then, grow- 
ing louder behind us, and I nerv- 
ously smoothed my sack suit 
and evened my breathing. The 
next moment, her drapery and 
platinum hair in order, she was 
handing me a glow-tipped reefer 
and saying coolly, “Here you are, 
Senor La Cruz, a Chihuahua 
Pot-Perfecto. Daddy always sasrs 
a man can’t smoke on tobacco 
alone.” 

As I shakingly inhaled the first 
piney puff, I looked straight out 

GALAXY 




at the horizon again and saw that 
my “mysterious silver light” was 
merely that of the new-risen 
moon, silhouetting one of the big 
antimacassar lighthouses. I real- 
ized somewhat groggily but with 
a clutch of anxiety that I had not 
only missed my big moment with 
Rachel Vachel, but was already 
breaking my date with La Cuca- 
racha. 

'T'he patio lights boomed on. I 
copied Rachel Vachel in lei- 
surely standing up and casually 
turning around, though I spoiled 
the effect a bit by clanking my 
exo-elbow against my pelvic gir- 
dle. Just come through the gringo 
door were (Jovemor Lamar and 
his four fellow big-wigs, all look- 
ing a' shade grim to me, and El- 
mo, who looked worried. 

“Most sorry to interrupt your 
tete-a-tete,” the Governor said 
smoothly, “I trust you weren’t 
bored, Senor La Cruz, and that 
my daughter entertained you ade- 
quately.” 

I could manage no answer save 
a swallow, which bobbed my ov- 
erly prominent Adam’s apple, and 
a somewhat jerky nod. 

“Now go to bed. Sugar,” he 
continued. “We have business to 
discuss with the Senor.” 

“But Daddy — ” 

“Sugar . .!” 

With a haughty shrug and 
thinning of lips, the Honorable 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



Rachel Vachel turned to me and 
said formally, “Good night, Se- 
nor La Cruz. I trust we have the 
opportunity of continuing our 
most interesting conversation! 
some other day.” And sHe stuck 
out her hand, palm down. 

I pressed and bowed over it. 
Though not risking a kiss this 
time, I did lightly scratch Her 
palm with my forefinger. 

Showing no reaction whatso- 
ever, she turned away and walked 
through the gringo door without 
looking to left or right. 

From the emphasis she had giv- 
en her last word, I knew I could 
expect no opportunity of further 
converse with her this night and 
must pin on La Cucarach'a any 
hopes I had of getting my jan- 
gled nerves soothed, especially 
my frustrated parasympathetic 
system. 

But to tell the whole truth, I 
was far, far more — oh so much! 
— concerned about the five un- 
smiling, craggy-visaged Texans I 
now faced, and it was chiefly my 
sjnnpathetic nervous S3retem, that 
old adrenal-squeezer, that was 
sending. Old tales of the venge- 
ances done in patrist societies 
on daughter-seducers and sister- 
stealers and mere lovers-up 
marched like a series of funeral 
corteges through my mind. I 
thought of Abelard and Chance 
Wayne. Rachel Vachel had as 
much as told me her father was 

61 




a constant spier on her activities. 
Would he have omitted those on 
the patio? Wouldn’t lie be sure 
to have had the couch bugged? 
And I had blurted out not only 
my grotesque passion, but also 
the secrets behind my trip to 
Terra, i I cursed myself for an 
Eros-besotted fool. 

It seemed to me most ominous 
that all five power-men were now 
equipped with' paired side arms 
belted over their beautifully tai- 
lored suits. In addition, anachron- 
istic rapiers hung from the Hips 
of Sheriff Chase and Ranger 
Hunt, and all five were once more 
making their nerve-twanging 
chink-chink, scratch-scratch tune. 

It struck me as particularly 
sinister that the Governor was 
plucking invisible lint from his 
vest without taking his eyes oft 
me. 

Then as Rachel Vachel vanish- 
ed and her rapid footsteps died 
away and I expected the worst, 
everything suddenly changed for 
the best, as at the fairy-god- 
mother moment in a children’s 
tale. I could hardly have been 
more surprised if dancing elves 
had popped from under the flag- 
stones. 

The five power-Texans relaxed 
and favored me with friendly 
smiles, while with the most win- 
ning of these, the Governor him- 
self, advanced toward me, saying, 
“Senor La Cruz, most honored 
62 



and patient of guests, it’s my 
pleasure to inform you that all 
arrangements save one Have been 
made for your passage by char- 
tered private rocketship to Ama- 
rillo Cuchillo tomorrow morn- 
ing.” And he lightly took my 
limp hand and pumped it warmly 
though carefully. His breath was 
redolent of bourbon. 

He went on casually, “The one 
omission is most trifling and real- 
ly unnecessary to correct except 
for reasons of courtesy. It’s that 
we visit tonight and get the coun- 
tersignature on your jet-cHarter of 
President Longhorn Elijah Aus- 
tin. The old gentleman would be 
hurt to Have missed a visit with 
you, and — sub rosa, sir — we 
want to continue a little political 
fence-mending.” 

I Hesitated. The Governor’s ex- 
pression seemed totally relaxed 
and friendly, free from guile as 

Tom Mix. I said, “But I thought 
» 

“Yes, sir, exactly, you thought 
— and no blame whatever attach- 
es to you for that. But . Elmo!” 

IVyT y friend — I suddenly 

felt that way toward him — 
was twisting his huge hat into 
what looked like a model of a 
saddle-shaped imiyerse, and he 
was working his lips and actually 
blushing. “Scully, I mean Senor 
La Cruz,” he choked out, “I was 
resh'ading the facts a little . no, 

GALAXY 




I was really lying to you quite a 
bit in our earlier conversations — 
chiefly by exaggerating my own 
importance and my inside knowl- 
edge of the current political situa- 
tion. 

“There was once indeed a 
little wounded feelings between 
President Austin and some of the 
other great statesmen of our land, 
but I blew them up out of all 
proportions. That arming of his 
Mexican houseboys, for instance, 
what a whopper! And for a fact 
I simply didn’t know — that’s 
how small a bug I am in the hu- 
man menagerie — that what 
wounds there were had been com- 
pletely healed and only in need 
of the lightest postoperative care. 
Just a lowdown Texas big-mouth, 
that’s all I am, Scully, and I hope 
you forgive me.” 

“Of course, Elmo,” I said 
quickly, embarrassed at his abject 
groveling, for that was what it 
had been, despite the humor with 
which he had pillowed it. I had 
grown to like Elmo, rather as one 
likes a clown. And to see a clown 
deflated, stripped or dissected is 
always bad, or at least uncom- 
fortable theater, 

I abruptly turned back to La- 
mar. “Is it necessary that my in- 
terview with President Austin 
take place tonight? I had rath- 
er — ” 

“I’m afraid it must, sir,” He in- 
terrupted me. “A soiree rather 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



than a matinee, as you gentlefolk 
of the stage put it. Your jet 
leaves early tomorrow, and I have 
already, pardon me, taken the 
liberty of arranging your recep- 
tion by our beloved prexy. I cad 
understand your desire for, nayj 
your medical need of rest, and I 
assure you the interview will Be 
very brief and your transporta- 
tion to and from it both rapid 
and unfatiguing.” 

“Quick and peaceful. Over in a 
wink,” Sheriff Chase confirmed, 
snapping his fingers once for un- 
necessary emphasis. 

As I hesitated again, I felt my 
reefer sting my fingers. Quickly 
shifting my grip back on the butt, 
I took a very long drag. 

Perhaps it was the pot tliaf 
gave me the inspiration and em- 
boldened me to act on it. 

“It wasn’t rest I was concerned 
about,” I said gaily. “Your hospi- 
talities have quite refreshed me. 
It was that I had the whim to 
take all by m3reelf tonight, by 
moonlight, a brief noctural jaunt 
through the quieter environs of 
your great city of freedom, em- 
ploying for that purpose the cat- 
wagon with which Mr. Earp so 
graciously provided me. Let me 
do this, and I shall be only too! 
happy to bandy amenities witS 
your prexy.” 

Frowning slightly and even 
more slightly shaking his head, 
Lamar said slowly, “I’m afraid 

63 




it’s already been determined tKat 
you travel by official limousine. 
A cat-wagon would hardly have 
the requisite dignity — ” 

“Tell you what, Cotton,” Sher- 
iff Chase broke in, “we can bring 
the wagon along on a flatbed 
racer Then soon as his meeting 
with Austin’s over, the Senor can 
begin this little private wander 
on which it seems that he’s set 
his heart.” 

“A happy inspiration!” Lamar 
said. His frown fading. “And now 
come, gentlemen, our time is 
growing short.” 

The loud clink of -Burleson’s 
coins was like a cymbal clash 
that begins a jolly march. Fan- 
ninowicz’s facial tic was a “For- 
ward!” 

I took a last drag of my reefer, 
crushed it in the nearest tray and 
stepped out with my illustrious 
entourage, the rh3rthmic clash' of 
my titanium footplates dominat- 
ing the thud of their leather boots. 
My cape was handed up toward 
me, and I swirled it carelessly 
around my shoulder-girdle with- 
out breaking stride. 

It occurred to me how villain- 
ous I was to arouse myself with 
one woman and then plan to sat- 
isfy myself with another. But 
such is human flesh — at least 
that of an audacious Thin with 
a perfectly tuned exoskeleton who 
was setting out on a planetary 
spree. 

64 



PRESIDENT’S MANSE 
'T^he downy, glimmer-windowed 
nest of darkness that was the 
limousine silently braked to a 
stop with a suddenness that mash- 
ed my face against my cheek- 
plates. With tiny groans the 
straps around my titanium rib 
cage and belly-support tightened 
almost to breaking, then they 
were merely snug again. Beside 
me, Ranger Commander Hunt 
cursed a simple, “Jack it!” as the 
exo-elbow of my outflung arm 
took him lightly across his hand- 
some Roman nose. 

From the other side Sheriff 
Chase fumbled at my riding-har- 
ness, but I brushed his Hands 
aside and deftly unsnapped the 
two straps myself. I was begin- 
ning to resent being treated as an 
invalid or baby. When they had 
got out, each almost tripping over 
his ceremonial sword — for such 
they had explained them to be — 
I followed Hunt as swiftly and 
surely as a tall metal monkey and 
found myself standing in the 
moonlight on a springy black 
driveway, the four other limou- 
sines drawn up in line two before 
and two behind and debouching 
their passengers, while to the ex- 
treme rear I thought I could 
make out the flatbed bearing my 
cat-wagon.

The climbing moon silliouetted 
B spire and hiighligtited several 
Others and also the three towers 
and slate roof of a vast building 
some 200 meters ahead. It look- 
led to my scenery-trained eyes like 
a Gothic mabse of old, specifical- 
ly one of those fanciful carpen- 
ter’s Gothic edifices of the late 
nineteenth century in America, 
abristle with balconies, columns 
and fretwork of Moorish, Baro- 
que and other manners too nu- 
nierous to list. 

Not a single window of the 
place showed light. 

There were no lights between 
nie and it, only a low, pale wall 
with an arch of triumph for ad- 
mittance to the driveway. 

The limousines had all doused 
their headlamps. 

It struck me that the stage had 
been set, not for a president’s re- 
ception, but for a ghost story. 

All it would have taken was 
one lighted window and a terrified 
beautiful girl in the foreground to 
make it the greatest of camp art. 

As if he had caught my first 
thought, I heard Elmo, as He 
came up behind me, boom out 
with a little of His earlier free- 
and-easy, “That old miser Long- 
horn Elijah! He’ll whup half to 
death a maid who leaves on a 25- 
watter over an escalator or in a 
John the instant someone Has 
wiped himself. But soon as we 
pass the arch, Scully, the whole 
66 



shebang’ll light up like a veritable 
fairyland, I can tell you that.” 

A discreet chuckle I recognized 
as Governor Lamar’s came from 
the figure approaching beside El- 
mo. He said, “Elmo puts it crude- 
ly, but it is true that President 
Austin is a thrifty old soul, pro- 
viding a Simon-simple answer to 
those who accuse our officialdom 
of private prodigality. Well, sir, 
do you feel able to proceed afoot? 
I shouldn’t like for the sake of 
your dignity to see you make a 
horizontal approach in a cat- 
wagon or stretcher, unless you 
feel it medically mandatory.” 
“We’d drive you straight to the 
door,” Commander Hunt assur- 
ed me, “but immemorial custom 
dictates that the prexy’s mansion 
be approached afoot by all and 
sundry.” 

“Two of us’ll walk close beside 
you and support you, of course,” 
Sheriff Chase added. “E|mo, you 
take his right arm.” 

“Nonsense, gentlemen, I am 
quite able to navigate ungrasped 
and erect on my trusty exo-legs,” 
I replied lightly, keeping out of 
my voice the gust of indignation 
I felt at this further evidence that 
they considered me a Hospital pa- 
tient. 

A nd with that I stepped out 
toward the dark mansion. 
Elmo stayed beside me, but for- 
tunately for His ribs, which would 

GALAXY 




have got a titanium dig, he did 
not attempt to touch' me. 

Professor Fanninowicz came 
Hurrying up on my other side, 
fumbling with wires and chatter- 
ing, “Sir, for the sake of science 
may I attach electrodes to — ” 

“No!” I rapped out. 

“But may I not at least accom- 
pany you and observe — ” 

“Yes, but hands of!” 

The dark figures which had 
emerged from the leading limou- 
sines parted for us. I noted that 
they wore dark uniforms which 
included knee-boots and black 
slouch hats and that they were 
armed with heavy laser-carbines. 
Ancient shell rifles or even an- 
tique powder-and-ball muskets 
would have seemed more appro- 
priate ceremonial weapons to 
match Hunt’s and Chase’s swords. 
But then I remembered what Ra- 
chel had told me of her father’s 
efforts to introduce an actual gla- 
cier into Wilder’s Japanese-deli- 
cate Skin of Out Teeth. Hunt’s 
rangers, I decided as we passed 
them, were lucky they Had not 
been made to tote ceremonial 
atomic bombs. 

Then Governor Lamar, step- 
ping uncomfortably close behind 
me, almost on my heels, called out 
softly but carryingly, “Everyone 
move very slowly now! We don’t 
want to hurry Senor La Cruz or 
cause him to strain his satellite- 
enfeebled heart.” 

A SPECTFR IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



That did it. As if hearts did not 
Have to work well and efficiently 
in free fall merely to supply tis- 
sues with oxygen and other nutri- 
mentl Tissues such as the cere- 
brum, of which I now bet we 
spacefolk had twice the volume of 
these bumbling Texans! All butt 
and no brain, like dinosaurs! 

I stepped out at my fastest, 
taking giant strides, my hood and 
cloak flapping behind me. In al- 
most no time Elmo and Fannino- 
wicz were panting. Such was my 
rage that I ignored my surround- 
ings, not pausing to ponder the 
function of the trenches we were 
now passing, nor of the slitted 
walls of thick metal on their man- 
sion-side edges, nor even of the 
dim figures crouched behind those 
walls. 

But I did catch the gasping 
Fanninowicz attaching an elec- 
trode to my pelvic girdle. He al- 
ready had one affixed to my 
shoulder yoke. The fine insulated 
wires faintly rattled against the 
drive behind us. Since he couldn’t 
measure my body electricity, he 
was evidentally hoping to find 
some in my exoskeleton. I jerked 
the attachments loose and struck 
his hands away with a blow of my 
wrist-plate that got out of him an, 
"Alii! Teufel! Gottveidammter 
Knochen-Mensch!” 

“For Weedin’ Jesus’ sake, fake 
it easy, Scully,” Elmo pled be- 
tween puffs. “We’re gonna get 

67 




there soon enough. And you 
know, even He didn't exactly race 
up Golgotfia.” 

Deaf to tKe connotative and al- 
lusive signi^cance in His words, I 
was busy planning my entrance 
speecK, w|iicfi began sometiung 
like, “rnw sorry to Save outdis- 
tanced my Texas escort, Your 
Sublime Excellency, but strcli was 
my eagerness and such’ their ex- 
cess of adipose tissue — well, one 
must admit, Ptexy, that some of 
them sweat a mite easy. I sub- 
mit in all humility that at least 
the Texas Rangers ought to keep 
in a nttle better physical trim. Of 
course witif someone as courfly 
and delicate as G o ver n or La- 
mar . .” 

T was darkly pleased to note that 
-*■ there were no longer footsteps 
behind us, even distant ones. The 
three of us were entering the shad- 
ow of the manse now. And as 
we passed under the great arch- 
way with Its ghostly bas-reliefs 
of guns, snorting Horses, dead In- 
dians and the like, even Fannin- 
owicz began to fall back, was 
gone. 

Elmo panted, “One thing I 
want to tell you, Scully, and I 
really mean it this time, you’re a 
true Texan of the Raven-Alama 
breed. I’m proud to have known 
you.” He grasped my hand with 
such obvious spontaneity and sin- 
cerity that I had no impulse to 
68 



strike it aside. Then he too was 
gone. 

I took two furious strides more, 
then began to slow down halfway 
through the third. My brain was 
starting to work again, just a cor- 
ner of it. 

Two scarlet beams sprang from 
the dark grounds, zizzling past 
me to either side. I smelt the reek 
of ions. I heard spluttering, 
crackling splashes behind me. 

Turning, I saw the two laser 
beams scattering gouts of white- 
hot molten stone from the bases 
of die triumphal arch’. EKmly I 
saw Fanninowicz rolling away, 
wrapped by his wires, behind the 
shelter of the pale wall. At least 
he had temporarily escaped tSe 
laser's light-stiletto. Of Eilmo I 
saw no sign. 

Then from c o rn e r s of the manse 
and grounds a dozen lights blazed 
on me — white lights so bright 
and hot I thought for a moment 
I was being disintegrated. If I 
hadn’t had practice from child- 
hood in avoiding looking directly 
at spotlights I’d have been blind- 
ed. 

The lights didn’t reveal a fairy- 
land, unless you count toy sol- 
diers four and a half feet high' as 
such. 

The grounds were crowded witH 
the shielded emplacements of 
laser- and lightning-guns and 
other heavy weaponry. They were 
manned by barefoot Mexicans 

GALAXY 




wearing brass cuirasses and brass 
helmets with colorful horsehair 
plumes. And all the guns were 
pointed straight at me. 

The natural thing, especially 
for me, would Have been to run 
like Hell. It was pure rage that 
Held me titanium-rooted — rage 
at Lamar and tHe rest for Having 
maneuvered me into this sitting- 
duck position, for using me as 
some sort of stalking Horse in 
their war against President Aus- 
tin, rage at myself for Having dis- 
missed them as bumblers and let- 
ting them convince me so easily 
of the untruth of Elmo’s earlier 
tales. 

I’d be damned if I’d let those 
bulky bastards — by now all safe- 
ly crouched in the outside trencH- 
es, their trenches — see me run. 

And still I wasn’t shot down, 
though both Elmo and Fannino- 
wicz had been fired on. Like their 
guns, the Mexican soldiers were 
staring wide-eyed at me — my 
tall and thin black form, my 
doubtless dazzling exoskeleton. 

It was then I got the glimmer 
of inspiration and acted cm it in- 
stantly. Raising my arms wide 
and high, so that all of my cloak 
was thrown back and my exo- 
skeleton completely in view, I 
thundered at my loudest, “I am 
Deathl Yo soy la Muerta! Soy el 
Esqueleto! Vamoosel” Then I 
brought my arms together and 
waved them Horizontally apart, as 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



if brushing all the brass-armored 
bent -backs off the stage. 

They wavaed. One ran. A sil- 
ver-helmeted officer drew a bead 
on him with a pistol and was 
himself zizzlingly transfixed on 
the red laser beam of cme of his 
own soldiers. 

Then they were all in flight, 
and I was tramping straight for- 
ward again, straight up the stairs 
leading to the spadous porch and 
the manse’s double doors. These 
slowly opened outward at my ap- 
proach, revealing that they were 
backed by great thicknesses of 
steeL 

I faced another curve of muz- 
zles and of silver-armored, star- 
ing, bent-back soldiery. I scatter- 
ed them as I had those outside 
and I followed them, still at my 
remorseless steady stride. I was 
beginning thoroughly to enjoy my 
role of Death, the Disperser of 
Armies. Then I realized I was 
doing exactly what Lamar and 
Company had wanted me to, win- 
ning them a bloodless battle. Ev- 
en that didn’t at once destroy my 
delight. 

Then I saw ahead of me a semi- 
circle of glass cases ten feet high'. 
There were at least twenty of 
them. 

T haltecL Striking with all his fa- 
bled cunning and genius for 
ffie unexpected. Death Had after 
a fashion stopped me.

EacK of the cases contained a 
life-size human figure in natural 
flesh tones and with Terran cloth- 
ing that ranged in style over the 
last 150 years. The earliest or 
oldest were about six feet tall. 
Then as the /eye ranged around 
the semicircle, they grew in height 
to eight feet and more. 

I recognized the Americans 
Kennedy and Johnson from my 
history prints. I realized I was 
looking at the presidents of Tex- 
as. 

They looked grimly back at me 
— some old, some middle-aged, 
some almost young. There were 
handsome faces, harsh faces, faces 
jowled and tiny-eyed with dissi- 
pation and greed. 

In the dimness they seemed 
alive. I felt sure the earliest were 
wax. I was not so sure about the 
latter. I recalled how the early 
Russians had mummified the 
bodies, or at least stuffed the 
hides of their early illustrious 
dead. 

Then I heard a rasping voice 
and looked up. 

Four or five stories above me 
was a magnificent domed skylight 
of stained glass, made darkly col- 
orful by the moonlight it trans- 
mitted. Curving down from be- 
neath it in a wide and graceful 
spiral came a stairway railed with 
dark, delicate metal tracery. Here 
at least was a glimpse of fairy- 
land. 

70 



And also an ogre from same. 
An ogre from whose quilted bath- 
robe a jowled and purplish face 
protruded, inset with pig eyes and 
topped by tousled wffite hair and 
wearing askew a golden wreath. 
He leaned over the stair railing 
about a floor and a half above 
me, cradling in one be-blanketed 
arm an antique double-barreled 
shotgun. 

“Whar are my Mexican House- 
boys?” he roared. “Wh'ar are you, 
you little skunks? They’s an at- 
tack? Shoot down every Ranger 
or other rebellious bein’ sete foot 
inside mah walls 1 Get the man 
with the base bullhorn! WHar’s 
my praetorian guard? Souad the 
trumpet! Ah, thar’s one of the 
assassins sent against me, sddnny 
bastard in a black minji suit, but 
it don’t hide him from mah all- 
seein’ eyes!” 

I lunged rapidly sideways un- 
der the stairs. The parquetted 
spot on which I’d been standing 
was blasted. Two ricochets stung 
my forehead and side while at 
least one more plinked off my 
exoskeleton. A glass case rang. 

I raced toward the back of the 
manse, taking the avenue of re- 
treat the silver-cuirassed Mexi- 
cans had used. Soon I had plung- 
ed into a dark, rather narrow, 
blessedly protective corridor. Be- 
hind me. President Austin’s voice 
ranted, “Dead as a doornail, dead! 
Come on, you traitors all and 

GALAXY 




taste the Old Man’s wrath. Sound 
the alarum belli” 

Then a younger voice cut in. 
“There he isl Burn him down! 
But don’t spoil His face! Get the 
other!” 

There was another shotgun 
blast, a scream, then even my 
corridor was red as Hell with 
leaked laser light — just in time 
to show me, before collision did, 
that the corridor abruptly chang- 
ed from a height of about four- 
teen feet to four and a half. The 
head space carried a moral so 
simple and carved so large that I 
had read it before the red light 
faded: 

WATCH OUT, 

ANYONE WHO’S TALL! 

MEXES, AREN’T YOU 
GLAD YOU’RE SMALL? 

I was on my hands and exo- 
knees as fast as I could fall and 
scuttling forward. True, the “Get 
the other!” might not mean me, 
and even if it did, the “get” might 
not mean “burn down,” but then 
again it might — and I had al- 
ready in the past two minutes 
learned something of Texas po- 
litical acumen. 

I heard a dull crash behind — 
Austin’s body falling? Don’t ask 
useless questions. Crawl faster, 
you idiot Thin! 

I do not know how long my 
A SPECreR IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



quadruped scramble through the 
darkness lasted, surely much less 
time than it seemed then. I do 
know that I made an even num- 
ber of right-angle turns and, by 
exercising choice at forks, man- 
aged to make as many left- as 
right-hand turns, ensuring that I 
was headed at the end in the same 
direction I had been at the be- 
ginning. Twice I half crawled, 
half tumbled down short stairs 
and once climbed up. More than 
once I gave thanks to Diana that 
my hands were homy palmed, 
that knee-plates covered my knee- 
caps and that my motors kept 
purring happily. I thanked her 
too that I had practiced crawling 
as well as walking, up in the cen- 
trifuge. I also gained a certain 
respect for the maze-running abil- 
ities of the Mexicans, who, surely 
often carrying trays of drinks and 
food, had presumably regularly 
treaded these inky corridors in 
the manse of the light-penurious 
Austin. Or had they used flash- 
lights? Somehow that seemed un- 
likely, but I wished I had one 
now. 

T?rom time to time an action- 
insulated comer of my mind 
thought thoughts: such as that 
the morale of the Rangers must 
be zero that they Hadn’t over- 
whelmed the manse by them- 
selves, but waited for the accident 
of my aid. But maybe it Bad been 

71 




essential to keep the political war 
secret and not destroy this Texas 
White House. 

As I right-angled right after a 
particularly long stretch <rf Mexi- 
can corridor, I heard a thumping 
scuttling b^iind me. A thin blue 
beam narrowly missed my with- 
drawing foot, and there was the 
faint smell of singed plastic where 
it struck the wall. 

A voice rebuked, “Cut your 
power, you dumb-Headed light- 
ning plumber! Order is to para- 
lyze him, not fry him — less we 
have to.” 

I was not greatly reassured. 

Thereafter I kept hearing the 
sounds of my pxirsuit. It did not 
gain on me. I was grimly pleased 
that my motored titanium was 
performing as well as their flerii. 

Suddenly the ceiHng rose. I was 
in a large room dimly lit by 
moonlight coming through win- 
dows and open Texan and Mexi- 
can doors. Food-smell and round 
hanging shapes suggested a kitch- 
en. I lifted to my feet, feeling a 
surge of dizziness and weakness, 
but I mastered them, tonguing 
down pills and water. I made for 
the Texan door in great strides, 
crashing down pots and cutlery. 
I heard angry calls from the crawl 
space behind, tut I was out of 
line with it. 

I stepped outside. I was on a 
narrow porch and at the head’ of 
a steep flight of stairs. I heard 

72 



an equine snort and a low chilliirg 
laugh — and I stopped. 

A few 3mrds beyond the foot of 
the stairs stood a huge white horse 
with black harness and silver- 
looking bit and Harness rings. 
Astride it was a figure all in 
black, from under whose black 
slouch hat silvery hair cascaded. 

Then Rachel Vachel’s face lift- 
ed out of shadow and in a bhir 
of nrovement her black-gauntlet- 
ed hands drew lightning pistols 
from the black Holsters at her side 
and directed them toward me. 

I had never faced, it seemed to 
me, anything icy as their needle 
muzzles and Her gaze. Of course, 
I told myself bitterly, she had 
been in on my betrayal from the 
start, casually using her seeming- 
ly naive ■wiles to brainwash me 
and soften me up for her father. 
I ought to have known you 
couldn’t ever trust a society pinko. 
I tasted bitterness, and not only 
from an anti gray pill that had 
been slow in going down. 

I heard rapid steps behmd me 
— two sets of them — and cries 
erf, “There’s the black bastard!” 
“We got him! — don’t move a 
muscle, Skfamyf” My arms were 
grasped from behind, and a sharp 
muzzle pressed against my tem- 
ple. 

Then with only the faintest 
whisper of ionization and only its 
most ghostly acid perfinne, two 
tenuous needle-beams sprang 

GAiAXY 




from tfie tips of Racfid VacHel’s 
pistols and bypassed my cfieeks 
indies to dtiier side. 

THe grip on my arms relaxed: 
tKe muzzle ceased to imck my 
temple, and tiiere were scrft yet 
ponderous tliuds on tHe porch' to 
either side of me. 

( C reetings, Captain Skull,” 

she called up to me. 
“Now hustle down fast and Kop 
up behind me. Those two Rangers 
are out for a half hour, but even 
with the morons opposing us, it’s 
a sin to waste time.” 

Suppressing surpnise and other 
emotions for the moment, I took 
the stairs two steps at a time, 
watching my feet narrowly, but 
calling back, “You mean we can 
escape? The Rangers haven’t the 
manse encircled?” 

“Hell, no. Like all Texas wars, 
this little scuffle’s been all false 
front. Kick up your leg now and 
give a jump with' the other. I’ll 
yank your shoulder.” 

“But Rachel,” I asked as I 
complied and found myself astride 
quivering horseflesh’ and my exo- 
sternum pressed to girl, “How did 
you know you’d find me here? 
How did you guess your father 
would use me to — ” 

“Easy as guessin’ a rat’ll bite,” 
she answered scornfully. “Now 
wrap your arms around me. All 
you got to do is figure out the 
sneakiest, safest course, and you

got Daddy’s mind read to tKe 
base of his spinal cord. See, I even 
stole your luggage and got it at 
my saddlebow. How’s that for 
service?” 

She turned in Ker saddle. Her 
pale, thinly, smiling face was close 
to mine, ‘^ow confess, Scully,” 
she said. “Aren’t you just a mite 
surprised to discover that the siUy 
little theater gal and giggly Gov- 
ernor’s daughter is in actuality 
Our Lady of Sudden Death, the 
Black Madonna of the Bent-Back 
Underground?” 

“Well, yes,” I said truthfully. 
“I mean no . .” 

She gave another of her chilling 
laughs. “You fnenfolk — ” she be- 
gan. Then her eyes, scanning my 
forehead, showed sudden concern. 
“You’re hurt, my lover.” 

Evidently the shotgun ricochet 
had drawn blood. “It’s nothing,” 
I told her. 

“It had better be,” she told me 
seriously, “because you got a lot 
more to do tonight. Pull your 
cloak and hood around you, your 
bones gleam too bright. And hang 
on tight now,’’ she added, turning 



front again and picking up the 
reins. “Oh you can feel me up a 
bit if you get the chance — wow, 
your skeleton’s still like ice. But 
hang on for your life — because 
it’s a far greater cause than even 
my lover’s precious existence 
that’s now at stake!” 

She touched with her heels the 
great white beast’s flanks, and we 
were soon going through tree 
shadows and silvery spaces at a 
ponderous gallop, which caused 
me to jounce considerably and 
not only lock my arms hand to 
elbow around her waist, but also 
steady my flapping legs by 
clenching them against the great 
heaving white barrel below me. In 
my brain there had gathered a 
certain bewilderment. 

“Where are we going?” I asked 
innocently. 

She replied, “To the central 
point of tonight’s riotous revolu- 
tionary assembly, which happens 
to be the bandstand comer of the 
Greasertown cemetery.” 

We galloped on through the 
moonlit night, my mind now truly 
a welter of confusion.

had to be about the size of an

was of the greatest importance.

The project is still classified, 
so we cannot in conscience give 
deep details of it. The project is 
still active, and perhaps an ans- 
wer can be found for it this sec- 
ond time. Ah well, we lost the 
first race, and the most populous 
one-third of our nation; but we 
lost it hard. We had them near 
beaten for a little while there. 
Another year, and DOW-MEC- 
TEC will have their first module 
ready. It wM probably be far too 
late, it win likely do no good at 
all, but you never know. The 
slimmest hope still remains . , 

But now they were looking 
very hard for that answer the 
first time: the three colonels, the 
High Commission of the colonels, 
the potential saviors of their 
country and the world. It was not 
for personal glory they sou^t 
this (except Dinneen a little) but 
for the ultimate good of the ulti- 
mate number. 

Colonel Dinneen strode up and 
down endless corridors, booming 
like a canary in his odd voice. He 
didn’t want the thing in two 
years, he wanted it in two min- 
utes, right now. 

Colonel Ludenschlager shuffled 
old brain-buster notes looking for 
a miracle. He had an impediment 
there; he didn’t believe in mira- 
cles. 

Colonel Schachmeister walked 
desolately through the city, pray- 
ing for Ae instant miniaturized

control station. He walked and 
walked; but where did he walk? 

“It is my unconscious leading 
me somewhere,” he mumbled. 
“And I will follow my uncon- 
scious whprever it leads, like a 
man in a ^eam.” 

That Schachmeister was an un- 
conscious phony. It wasn’t his 
unconscious leading him any- 
where! It was his conniving own 
self walking furtively where his 
own dishonesty would not allow 
him to walk openly. And he had 
that address graven on his brain 
by a micro-styhis. 

There was something about a 
three-foot-wide Hippodrome from 
his bo 3 rhood ; there was something 
of the credence in the incredible: 
and both these things were 
shameful to him as a man of 
science, and a colonel moreover. 

Well, it was a diabby enough 
nd^iborhood. The alley was 
worse, and yet even this was not 
the final alley. He found it then, 
the “small alley,” hardly a skunk 
track. He followed it. He knocked 
crunchingly on a door and near 
lost his hand in the termite-eaten 
wood. 

“Be careful there!” an ancient 
voice Matted out like slats falling 
down in an old bed. “Those are 
friends of my own people, and 
my people will not have them dis- 
commoded. After all, they are 
quiet, they do no harm, and they 
eat only wood.”

“It — it’s the same McGruder 
It is Malcomb ‘the Marvelous' 
McGruder himself, the Grand 
Master of McGruder’s Marvels!” 
Colonel Schachmeister detonated 
in wonder. 

“Oh sure, little boy,” came the I 
wonderful voice like an old organ 
filling with noise again and blow- 
ing the dust off itself in doing so. 
“And it’s the same little Heinie 
Schachmeister! Why aren’t you 
in school today, Heinie? Oh, 1 
notice that you have grown, and 
perhaps you are too old for school 
now.” 

“It’s marvelous to see you 
again. Marvelous!” Schachmeist- 
er breathed in awe. “I had no idea 
that you were the same one, or 
that you were still alive.” 

“Come in, little Heinie. And 
what are you doing? I have never 
seen your name in the Flea-Bag, 
so I suppose you have failed in 
your early ambition.” 

“Ah, McGruder, I don’t know 
what the Flea-Bag is, and I for- 
get what early ambition of mine 
you refer to.” 

“The Flea-Bag, Heinie, is a 
mimeographed sheet that still cir- 
culates among the members of 
our dwindling profession. And 
your early ambition was to grow 
up and have fleas of your own.” 
“Wish I had done it, McGruder, 
wish I had done it, especially on 
days like this. Some of my happi- 
est hours were spent watdiing 

GALAXY 




McGmder’s Marvels, that great- 
est of oil Flea Circuses, in that 
little hide in the walL” 

"In the Hippodrome, you 
mean, Heinie? Do you remember 
the Coaidunan Set?” 

“Yes, yes, and the flea up on 
the coachman’s seat, in livery, 
and with the whip! McGruder, 
vhen you screwed the three sec- 
tions of the microscope together, 
you could see the very braiding 
of that coachman’s whip. And the 
flea in harness! The harness was 
perfect, and had little bells on it. 
The bells had clappers, and you 
could hear them jingle when you 
screwed that little thing into your 
ear. And the flea in harness was 
shod, with real horse-shoes, or 
flea -shoes.” 

CtTVyrore, Heinie, more! The 
shoes had authentic calks 
on them, and nails! And the nails 
were of no ordinary sort, but were 
ancient horseshoe nails with the 
oblong wedge-shaped heads. You 
could see that when you screwed 
the fourth section into the micro- 
scope. And you remember the 
lady fleas inside the coach, Hein- 
ie?” 

“Yes, yes, dressed in old Em- 
pire style with the high hair on 
them, and the flounce stuff. And 
when you screwed the little thing 
into your nose you could smell 
their perfume. What was it, Mc- 
Gruder?” 

80 



“Ptintemps. And you may not 
know it, but there were ei^t pet- 
ticoats on each of those lady 
fleas, and the microscope lace on 
even the inmost of them was done 
with loving care and surpas^g 
detail, more than nine hundred 
loops on the bottom round in the 
style that is called punto a irop- 
po. Your eyes used to boggle at 
my things, little Heinie.” 

“My mind boggles at some- 
thing now. That was forty years 
ago. McGruder, I know you were 
good, but this passes reason! You 
still have your little lathes and 
turners and instruments here, but 
you did not make a miniaturized 
control station with such!” 

“Of course not, Heinie. The de- 
tailing for the little control station 
had to be a thousand times finer, 
actually eight thousand times 
finer, than anything I could do 
on my own little lathes. I’m sur- 
prised you should ask such a 
silly question, Heinie.” 

“Is that the control station 
there. Marvelous?” 

“That’s it, Heinie. Take it 
along and try it and send me 
the twenty-four dollars if it 
works. I’ll have another one this 
time tomorrow if you wish. It’s 
nice to have seen you. I’m always 
happy when the little boys come 
back to see me again.” 

The Marvelous McGruder still 
had a certain threadbare elegance 
about him.

“McGniuleir how did you make 
the COndXOl station? ” 

“Trade spcrct, Heinie. You re- 
member tn.y pattex. Euetythiag 
was always a trade secret.” 

“McGcuder, I’m> going to ask

out q£ nowadays? No wonder 
we’re in tcoubde! You know how 
hard it is, to get fleas to wear 
clothes for even a few seconds? 
You know how hard it is to teade 
them even the most simple trick? 
Heinie, fleas axe stupid, and so 
ace youl No, I will settle that. 
Fleas did not, in any way at all, 
have arLything to do with making 
that mkuatnre control station. I 
didn’t have much to do with it 
myself. Subcontracted it, really.

Colonel Schaciuiieister left the 
shabby elegant old man, Mal- 
comb ‘the Maxvdous^ McQcuder; 
and he took the miniaturized 
contrcd station along with him.

“There are only tmenty-

“I’ll remember to get a pack-

But it was going well for the 
colonels in that time. And yet 
they wanted them faster than one 
a day. 

“We have no desire for person- 
al gain or glory,” said Dinneen, 
“except tnyself a little. But if that 
crazy old man can make one a 
day, it should be possible for us 
to make a thousand. Go back to 
him, Schachmeister. Find out 
how he does it We have spied 
on him, of course, but we can’t 
understand it at all. The control 
stations seem to form themselves 
on his table there. They continue 
to take form even while he is 
asleep. And there’s a fxuther mys- 
tery. He never checked out prints 
of the larger model that was to 
be miniaturized. What does he 
work from?” 

“Is it true, Schachmeister, that 
he once operated a flea circus in 
New York?” Ludensdilager ask- 
ed. 



“Yes, it’s true enough. He’s the 
same man.” 

“Can there be some possible 
connection? No, no, don’t laugh! 
It cannot be any sillier than what 
is already 'happening.” 

“No, men, there isn’t a con- 
nection. He said to me, and he 
was speaking the truth, that fleas 
did not, in any way, have any- 
thing to do with the control sta- 
tions. And, yet, I remember an 
ugly smear against McGruder 
from the early years — ” 



82 



“What is that, Schachmeister?" 
Dinneen demanded avidly. 

“That he sometimes usa! 
mechanical fleas. I did not be- 
lieve it.” 

“Go to him, Schachmeister,” 
Dinneen and Ludenschlager bolli 
begged. “If you cannot find out 
how he makes them, at least ask 
if he cannot make them faster.” 

tC'^he Covenant,” it said. 

“There are only three Goo- 
ber Number One peanuts left 
here. Replenish the stock, Mc- 
Gruder, or the Covenant will 
come to an end this very day. 
I’d get you an extension for the' 
affection I have for you, but the 
numerous members of the smaller 
orders will not hear of it. There 
are seven orders, as you know, 
each smaller than the other. 
Sometimes they are hard to deal 
with, particularly the fovir smaller 
orders which I cannot see myself. 
Today, McGruder, Goober 
Johns!” 

“I swear I will remember it,” 
McGruder swore. “I’ll get a pack- 
age at the Rowdy-Dow this very 
afternoon.” 

C olonel Schachmeister went 
back to see Malcomb ‘the 
Marvelous’ McGruder. McGrud- 
er was no longer shabby. He was 
the cream of old con men with an 
ivory-colored topper and canary- 
colored vest and gloves. He ges- 

GALAXY 




tured with a silver-headed cane. 
He welcomed Heinie Schach- 
meister with incredible flourish, 
and Sdhachmeister came right to 
the point 

“Will you not tell me how you 
make the stations, Marvelous? It 
is important.” 

“No. I will not tell you. It is 
important to me, that I slice up 
this fat hog for myself, and twen- 
ty-four dollar slices please me 
mightily.” 

“Marvelous, you did not check 
out a set of plans for this thing. 
From what do you miniaturize?” 

“Well, I was going to, Heinie. 
I went by the place where the 
plans were to be had. But I 
found that the prints for that 
gadget weighed four hundred 
pounds, and also that I would 
have to put down a token de- 
posit of $50,000.00 to check out 
a set of them. Both these things 
were too heavy for me. So I 
slipped a few of my small associ- 
ates into a packet of plans (I al- 
ways was a tricky man with my 
hands, 5 rou know), and they re- 
corded the information in their 
own way.” 

“Your small associates — ah — 
how long did it take them to re- 
cord the plans?” 

“About as long as it took me to 
light a cigar.” 

“And how many of these asso- 
ciates were there?” 

“Don’t know, Heinie. They 
McGRUDER'S MARVELS 



were sixth and seventh order as- 
sociates, so there must have been 
quite a few of them.” 

“What do they look like, Mc- 
Gruder?” 

“Don’t know. I’ve never seen 
them. I can see only the first 
order ones, and the second order 
ones through a strong microscope. 
And each order can see only two 
orders smaller than itself, by us- 
ing extreme magnification.” 
“They are not fleas?” 

“Of course not, Heinie! What’s 
the matter with you?” 

“Are they mechanical?” 

“No, not medhanicaL But they 
are mechanically inclined, in the 
smaller orders of them.” 

“How did you become — ah — 
associated with them. Marvel- 
ous?” 

“One of the first order ones 
was a friend of a flea who once 
worked with me. The flea intro- 
duced us, and we rather took to 
each other. We both know how to 
latoh onto a good thing when we 
see it.” 

“Marvelous, would it be possi- 
ble to make more than one con- 
trol station a day.” 

“Sure. I just didn’t want to 
milk it dry too soon. Get you a 
dozen a day, if you want them. 
AH it’ll take is a bigger sack of 
peanuts.” 

“McGruderl Did I hear yoti 
ri^t?” 

“I don’t know what you heard, 

83

The twenty-foor dollars a day 
and everything s gone. I will 
have to live by my wits again, 
and I always hate tn get a 
comfortable coo that has kept 
me.” 

“McGruder,” the frantic Colo- 
nel Schachmoster moaned, “it 
isn’t merely that there will be no 
more of the stations, it is that 
those already in service have gene 
dead or disappeared also. This is 
irot possible. They were made to 
operate forever.” 

“Don’t diink so, Heinie, not 
after the Covenant was broken. 
I think that the guys in them quit 
when they heard about the wrong 
peanuts.’’ 

“What guys? What peanuts? 
We’ve lost the jump on them, 
McGruder. A third of our country 
will be gone before we can insti- 
tute a holding action, without the 
miniature stations. What made 
them go dead, McGruder?” 

“I figure it all out now, Keinie. 
They didn’t make any little con- 
trol stations at all. They took all 
of us in. They didn’t any more 
know how to make little control 
stations than I did, but they were 
smart enough to fake it and make 
them work. I tell you a thing, 



Heinie, and you write it down so 
you remen^Der it when you get 
big: never trust a bag you can't 
see.” 

“But they worked. Marvelous! 
They wtM'ked perfectly till tiiey 
went dead or disappeared. They 
handled all the data flows per- 
fectly. They responded, they 
monitored, they inhibited. Cer- 
tainly they were control stations.” 

“Not really, Heinie. Hey, this 
old town will be gone in another 
five minutes, won’t it! I bet that 
one took out thirty square blocks. 
Man, feel the hot blast from it 
even here. Your sleeve's on fire, 
Heinie. Your mother will scold 
and moan when she sees how it’s 
burned. See, this is the way it 
was — You know the man who 
made all the fancy little cars so 
cheap, and nobody knew how he 
did it?” 

“No, no, McGruder, what is it? 
Oh, the asphalt is flowing like 
water in the streets ! What do you 
mean?” 

“A guy that bought one of 
those little cars lifted up the hood 
one day. It didn’t have a motor in 
it. It didn’t have any works at 
all in it. It’s the same as these 
little control stations were. It just 
had a little guy in there pedaling 
the pedals to make it go. Now 
they quit pedaling, H^nie.

McGRUDER'S MARVELS 



85 





I 

''T^hen, the planet had no name. 

It circles a star which in 2830 
lay beyond the fringe of known 
space, a distance of nearly forty 
light-years from Sol. The star is 
a K9, somewhat redder than Sol, 
somewhat smaller. The planet, 
swinging eighty million miles 
from its primary in a reasonably 
circular orbit, is a trifle cold for 
human tastes. 

In the year 2830 one Louis 
Gridley Wu happened to be pass- 
ing. The emphasis on accident is 
intended. In a universe the size 
of ours almost anything that can 



happen, will. Take the soinci- 
dence of his meeting — 

But we’ll get to that. 

Louis Wu was one hundred and 
eighty years old. As a regular 
user of boosterspice, he didn’t 
show his years. If he didn’t get 
bored first, or broke, he might 
reach a thousand. 

“But,” he sometimes told him- 
self, “not if I have to put up with 
any more cocktail parties, or 
bandersnatch hunts, or painted 
flatlanders swarming through an 
anarchy park too small for them 
by a factor of ten. Not if I have 
to live through another one-night 
love affair or another twenty-year 



86 




marriage or another twenty-min- 
ute wait for a transfer booth that 
blows its zap just as it’s my turn. 
And people. Not if I have to live 
with people, day and night, all 
those endless centuries.” 

When he started to feel like 
that, he left. It had happened 
three times in his life, and now 
a fourth. Presumably it would 
keep happening. In such a state 
of anomia, of acute anti-every- 
thing, he was no good to anyone, 
especially his friends, most es- 
pecially himself. So he left. In a 
small but adequate spacecraft, 
his own, he left everything and 
everyone, heading outward for the 
fringe of known space. He would 
not return imtil he was desperate 
for the sight of a human face, 
the sound of a human voice. 

On the second trip he had grit- 
ted his teeth and waited until he 
was desperate for the sight of a 
kzinti face. 

That was a long trip, he re- 
membered. And, because he had 
only been three and a half months 
in space on this fourth trip, and 
because his teeth still snapped to- 
gether at the mere memory of a 
certain human voice . because 
of these things, he added, “I think 
this time I’ll wait till I’m desper- 
ate to see a kdatlyno. Female, of 
course.” 

Few of his friends guessed the 
wear and tear these trips saved 
him. And them. 

THERE IS A TIDE 



T Te spent the months reading, 
while his library played or- 
chestrated music. By now he was 
well clear of known space. Now 
he turned the ship ninety degrees, 
beginning a wide circular arc with’ 
Sol at the center. 

He approached a certain K9 
star. He dropped out of hyper- 
drive well clear of the singularity 
in hyperspace which surrounds 
any large mass. He accelerated 
into the system on his main 
thruster, sweeping the space 
ahead of him with the deep-radar. 
He was not looking for habitable 
planets. He was looking for 
Slaver stasis boxes. 

If the hyperwave pulse return- 
ed no echo, he would accelerate 
until he passed the star, and keep 
accelerating until he could shift 
to hyperdrive. The velocity would 
stay with him, and he could use 
it to coast through the next sys- 
tem he tried, and the next, and 
the next. It saved fuel. 

He had never found a Slaver 
stasis box. It did not stop him 
from looking. 

As he passed through the 53 ^- 
tem, the deep-radar showed him 
planets like pale ghosts, light 
gray circles on the white screen. 
The K9 sun was a wide gray disk, 
darkening almost to black at the 
center. The near-black was de- 
generate matter, compressed past 
the point where electron orbits 
collapse entirely. 



87 




He was well past tlie K9 sun, 
and still accelerating, wHen ttk 
screen sKowed a tiny black fleck. 

"No system is perfect, of 
course,” lie muttered as Be turn- 
ed off the drive. He talked to 
himself a good deal, out here 
where noboi^y could interrupt 
him. 

“It usually saves fuel,” he told 
himself a week later. By then he 
was out of the singularity in 
clear space. He took the ship in- 
to fiyperdrive, circled halfway 
round the system, and began de- 
celerating. The velocity he’d built 
up during those first two weeks 
gradually left him. Somewhere 
near where he’d found a black 
speck in the deep-radar projec- 
tion, he slowed to a stop. 

''T^hough he had never realized 
it until now, his system for 
saving fuel was based on the as- 
sumption that he would never 
find a Slaver box. But the fleck 
was there again, a black dot on 
the gray ghost of a planet. Louis 
Wu moved in. 

The world looked something 
like Earth. It was nearly the same 
size, very much the same shape, 
somewhat the same color. There 
was no moon. 

Louis used his telescope on the 
planet and whistled appreciative- 
ly. Shredded white doud over 
imisty blue . , . faint continental 
outlines ... a hurricane whorl

near the equator. The ice caps 
looked big, but there would be 
warm climate near the equator. 
The air looked sweet and non- 
carcinogenic on the spectrograph. 
And nobody on itf Not a soulf

Voices. No faces. 

“What the hell,” he chortled. 
“I’ve got my box. FU just spend 
the rest of my vacation here. No 
men. No women. No children.” 
He frowned and rubbed the fringe 
of hair along his jaw. “Am I being 
hasty? Maybe I should knock.” 

But he scaimed the radio 
bands and got nothing. Any civil- 
ized planet radiates like a small 
star in the radio range. More- 
over, there was no sign of civili- 
zation, even from a hundred miles 
up. 

“Great I Okay, first FIl get 
that old stasis box — ” He was 
sure it was that. Nothing but 
stars and stasis boxes were dense 
enough to show black in the re- 
flection of a hyperwave pulse. 

He followed the image around 
the bulge of the planet. It seemed 
the planet had a moon after ah. 
The moon was twelve hundred 
miles up, and it was ten feet 
across. 

“Now why,” He wondered 
aloud, “would the Slavers have 
put it in orbit? It’s too easy to 
find. They were in a war, for 
Finagle’s sake! And why would 
it stay here?” 



GALAXY 




The little moon was still a 
couple of thousand miles away, 
invisible to the naked eye. The 
scope showed it clearly enough’. 
A silver sphere ten feet through’, 
with no marks on it. 

“A billion and a half years it’s 
been there,” said Louis to him- 
self, said he. “And if you’ll be- 
lieve that, you’ll believe anything. 
Something would have knocked it 
down. Dust, a meteor, the solar 
wind. Tnuctip soldiers. A mag- 
netic storm. Nah.” He ran his 
fingers through straight black 
hair grown too long. “It must 
have drifted in from somewhere 
else. Recently. Wha ...” 

Another ship, small and coni- 
cal, had appeared behind the 
silvery sphere. Its hull was green, 
with darker green markings. 

II 

( C "TNamn,” said Louis. He didn’t 
recognize the make. It was 
no human ship. “Well, it could 
be worse. They could have been 
people.” He used the com laser. 

The other ship braked to a 
stop. In courtesy, so did Louis. 

“Would you believe it?” he de- 
manded of himself. “Three years 
total time I’ve spent looking for 
stasis boxes. I finally find one, 
and now something else wants it 
too!” 

The bright blue spark of an- 
other laser glowed in the tip of 
THERE IS A TIDE 



the alien cone. Louis listened to 
the autopilot-computer chuckling 
to itself as it tried to untangle 
the signals in an unknown laser 
beam. At least they did use lasers, 
not telepathy or tentacle-waving 
or rapid changes in skin color. 

A face appeared on Louis’s 
screen. 

It was not the first alien he had 
seen. This, like some others, had 
a recognizable head: a cluster of 
sense organs grouped around a 
mouth, with room for a brain. 
Trinocular vision, he noted: the 
eyes set deep in sockets, well pro- 
tected, but restricted in range of 
vision. Triangular mouth, too, 
with yellow, serrated bone knives 
showing their edges behind three 
gristle lips. 

Definitely, this was an un- 
known species. 

“Boy, are you ugly,” Louis re- 
frained from saying. The alien’s 
translator might be working by 
now. 

His own autopilot finished 
translating the alien’s first mes- 
sage. It said, “Go away. This ob- 
ject belongs to me.” 

“Remarkable,” Louis sent back. 
“Are you a Slaver?” The being 
did not in the least resemble a 
Slaver. 

“That word was not translat- 
ed,” said the alien. “I reached the 
artifact before you did. I will 
fight to keep iL” 

Louis scratched at his chin, at 

89 




two weeks’ growth of bristly 
beard. His ship had very little to 
fight with. Even the fusion plant 
which powered the thruster was 
designed with safety in mind. A 
laser battle, fought with com 
lasers turned to maximum, would 
be a mere endurance test; and 
he’d lose, for the alien ship had 
more liia^ to 'absorb more heat. 
He had ho weapons per se. Pre- 
sumably the alien did. 

But the stasis box was a big 
one. 

The tnuctipun-Slaver war had 
wiped out most of the intelligent 
species of the galaxy, a billion 
and a Half years ago. Countless 
minor battles must Have occurred 
before a Slaver-developed final 
90 



weapon was used. Often the Slav- 
ers, losing a battle, had stored 
valuables in a stasis box, and 
hidden it against tlie day they 
would again be of use. 

No time passed inside a closed 
stasis box. Alien meat a billion 
and a half years old had emerged 
still fresh from its hiding place. 
Weapons and tools showed no 
trace of rust. Once a stasis box 
had disgorged a small, tarsierlike 
sentient being, still alive. That 
former slave had lived a strange 
life before the aging process 
claimed her, the last of her spe- 
cies. 

Slaver stasis boxes were beyond 
value. It was known that the 
tnuctipun, at least, had known 

GALAXY 




the secret of direct conversion of 
matter. PerKaps their enemies Had 
loo. Someday, in a stasis box 
lomewhere outside known space, 
rucK a device would be found. 
Then fusion power would be as 
obsolete as internal combustion. 

And this, a sphere ten feet in 
diameter, must be the largest 
itasis box ever found. 

ttT too will fight to keep the 
artifact,” said Louis. “But 
consider this. Our species has met 
once, and will meet again, regard- 
less of who takes the artifact now. 
We can be friends or enemies. 
Why should we risk this relation- 
ship by killing?” 

The alien sense-cluster gave 
away nothing. “What do you pro- 
pose?” 

“A game of chance, with the 
risks even on both sides. Do you 
play games of chance?” 

“Emphatically yes. The process 
of living is a game of chance. To 
avoid chance is insanity.” 

“That it is. Hmmm.” Louis re- 
garded the alien head that seemed 
to be all triangles. He saw it ab- 
ruptly whip around, tlick, to face 
straight backward, and snap back 
in the same instant. The sight did 
something to the pit of his 
stomach. 

“Did you speak?” the alien 
asked. 

“No. Won’t you break your 
neck that way?” 

THERE IS A TIDE 



“Your question is interesting. 
Later we must disctiss anatomy. 
I have a proposal.” 

“Fine.” 

“We shall land ort the world 
below us. We will meet between 
our ships. I will do you the 
courtesy of emerging first. Can 
you bring your translator?” 

He could connect the computer 
with his suit radio. “Yes.” 

“We will meet between our 
ships and play some simple game, 
familiar to neither of us, depend- 
ing solely on chance. Agreed?” 
“Provisionally. WHat game?” 
The image on the screen rip- 
pled with diagonal lines.> Some- 
thing interferring with' the signal? 
It cleared quickly. ‘*Tiiere k a 
mathematics game,” said ttie 
alien. “Our mathematics wUI cer- 
tainly be similar.” 

“True.” Though Loum had 
heard of some decidedly peculiar 
twists in alien mathematios. 

“The game involves a screee.” 
The alien raised a three-clawed 
hand, holding a lens-shaped ob- 
ject. The alien’s mutually oppos- 
ed fingers turned it so that Loius 
could see the different markings 
on each side. “This is a screee. 
You and I will throw it upward 
six times each'. I will choose one 
of the symbols, you will choose 
the other. If my symbol faUs 
looking upward more often than 
yours, the artifact is mine. The 
risks are even.”

Tfie image rippled, tHen dear- 
ed. 

“Agreed,” said Lous. He was 
a bit disappointed in tKe simplid- 
ty of tKe game. 

“We sKallbotH accderate away 
from tKe artifact. Will you follow 
me down?” 

“I will,” said T.niiig- 
TKe image disappeared. 

Ill 

T ouis Wu scratched at a week’s 
' growtK of beard. WKat a way 
to greet an alien ambassador! In 
the worlds of men Louis Wu 
dressed impeccably; but out here 
he felt free to look like death 
warmed over, all the time. 

But how was a — Trinoc sup- 
posed to know that he diould 
have shaved? No, that wasn’t tKe 
problem. 

Was he fool or genius? 

He had friends, many of them, 
with habits like his own. Two had 
disappeared decades ago; he no 
longer remembered their names. 
He remembered only that each 
had gone hunting stasis boxes in 
this direction and that each had 
neglected to come back. 

Had they met alien ships? 

There were any number of 
other explanations. Half a year 
or more spent alone in a single- 
ship was a good way to find out 
whether you liked yourself. If you 
decided you didn’t, there was no 
92 



point in returning to tiie worlds 
of men. 

But there were aliens out here 
Armed. One rested in oriiit five 
hundred miles ahead of £s slup, 
with a valuable artifact halfway 
betwe en . 

Still, gambling was safer than 
fi ghting - Louis Wu waited for the 
alien’s next move. 

That move was to drop like a 
rock. The alien ship must have 
used at least twenty gees of purii. 
After a moment of shock, Louis 
followed under the same acceler- 
ation, protected by his cabin 
gravity. Was the alien testing his 
maneuverability? 

Possibly not. He seemed con- 
temptuous of tricks. Louis, trail- 
ing the alien at a goodly distance, 
was now much' closer to the silver 
sphere. Suppose he just turned 
ship, ran fca" the artifact, strapped 
it to his hull and kept running? 

Actually, that wouldn’t work. 
He’d have to slow to reach the 
sphere; the alien wouldn’t have 
to slow to attack. Twenty gees 
was close to his ship’s limit. 

Running might not be a bad 
idea, though'. WKat guarantee 
had he of tlie alien’s good faith? 
What if the alien “cheated”? 

That risk could be minimized. 
His pressure suit had sensors to 
monitor his body functions. Louis 
set the autopilot to blow the fus- 
ion plant if his heart stopped. He 
rigged a signal button on his suit 

GALAXY 




to blow the plant whether His 
heart failed or not. 

The alien ship burned bright 
orange as it Hit air. It fell free 
and then slowed suddenly a mile 
over tKe ocean. “SKow-off,” Louis 
muttered and prepared to imi- 
tate tKe maneuver. 

'^He conical ship showed no ex- 
haust. Its drive must be 
either a reactionless drive, like 
his own, or a kzin-style induced 
gravity drive. Both were neat and 
clean, silent, safe to bystanders 
and highly advanced. 

Islands were scattered across 
the otean. The alien circled, chose 
one at seeming random, and 
landed like a feather along a bare 
shoreline. 

Louis followed him down. 
There was a bad moment while 
he waited for some tmimaginable 
weapon to fire from the groimded 
ship, to tear him flaming from 
the sky while his attention was 
distracted by landing procedures. 
But he landed without a jar, sev- 
eral hundred yards from the 
alien cone. 

“An explosion will destroy 
both our ships if I am harmed,” 
he told the alien via signal beam. 

“Our species seem to think 
alike. I will now descend.” 

Louis watched him appear near 
the nose of his ship, in a wide 
circular airlock. He watched the 
alien drift gently to the sand. 
THERE tS A TIDE 



Then He clamped His Helmet 
down and entered the airlock. 

Had he made the right deci- 
sion? 

Gambling was safer than war. 
More fun, too. Best of all, it gave 
him better odds. 

“But I’d hate to go Home with- 
out that box,” he said. In nearly 
two hundred years of life, Ke had 
never done an5rthing as impor- 
tant as finding a stasis box. He 
had made no discoveries, won no 
elective offices, overthrown no 
governments, then this was lus 
big chance. 

“Even odds,” He said, and turn- 
ed on the intercom as He descend- 
ed. 

His muscles and semicircular 
canals registered about a gee. A 
hundred feet away, waves slid 
hissing up onto pure white sand. 
The waves were green and Huge, 
perfect for riding; the beacK a 
definite beer party beach. 

Later, perhaps he would ride 
those waves to shore on his belly, 
if the air checked out and the 
v/ater was free of predators. He 
hadn’t had time to give the planet 
a thorough checkup. 

Sand tugged at his boots as fie 
went to meet the alien. 

The alien was five feet talL He 
had looked much taller descend- 
ing from his ship, but tfiat was be- 
cause he was mostly leg. More 
than three feet of skiimy leg, a 
torso like a beer barrel, and no 

93 




neck. Impossible that his neck- 
less neck should be so supple. But 
the chrome yellow skin fell in 
thick rolls around the bottom of 
Eis head, hiding anatomical de- 
tails. 

His sujt was transparent, a 
roughly alien-shaped balloon, 
constricted at the shoulder, above 
and below the complicated elbow 
joint, at the wrist, at hip and 
knee. Air jets showed at wrist and 
ankle. Tools hung in loops at the 
chest. A back pack hung from the 
neck, under the suit. Louis noted 
all these tools with trepidation; 
any one of them could be a 
weapon. 

1 1 T e'xp^ted that you would be 
taller,” said the alien. 

“A laser screen doesn’t tell 
much, does it? I think my trans- 
lator may have mixed up right 
with left, too. Do you have the 
coin?” 

“The scree?” The alien pro- 
duced it. “‘Shall there be no pre- 
liminary talk? My name is scree.” 

“My machine can’t translate 
that. Or pronounce it. My name 
is Louis. Has your species met 
others besides mine?” 

“Yes, two. But I am not an 
expert in that field of knowl- 
edge.” 

“Nor am I. Let’s leave the po- 
litenesses to the exjjerts. We’re 
here to gamble.” 

“Choose your syahol,” said ffie 

94 



alien, and handed him the coin. 

Louis looked it over. It was a 
lens of platinum or something 
similar, sharp-edged, with the 
three-clawed hand of his new 
gambling partner on one side and 
a planet, with heavy ice caps out- 
lined, decorating the other. May- 
be they weren’t ice caps, but con- 
tinents. 

He held the coin as if trying to 
choose. Stalling. Those gas jets 
seemed to be attitude jets, but 
maybe not. Suppose he won? 
Would he win only the chance to 
be murdered? 

But they’d both die if his heart 
stopped. No alien could have 
guessed what kind of weapon 
would render him helpless with- 
out killing him. 

“I choose the planet. You flip 
first.” 

The alien tossed the coin in the 
direction of Louis’s ship. Louis’s 
eyes followed it down, and he 
took two steps to retrieve it. The 
alien stood beside him when he 
rose. 

“Hand,” he said. “My turn.” 
He was one down. He tossed the 
coin. As it spun, gleaming, he saw 
for the first time that the alien 
ship was gone, 

“What gives?” he demanded. 

“There is no need for us to 
die,” said the alien. It held some- 
thing that had hung in a loop 
from its chest. “This is a weapon, 
but both will die if I use it. Please 

GALAXY 




lo not try to reacH your ship. 

Louis touched the button that 
would blow His power plant. 

“My ship lifted when you tum- 
nl your head to follow the screee. 

I ly now my ship is beyond range 
Ilf any possible explosion you can 
bring to bear. There is no need 
for us to die, provided you do not 
iry to reach your ship.” 

“Wrong. I can leave your ship 
without a pilot.” He left his hand 
where it was. Rather than be 
rheated by an alien in a gambling 

game — , j 

“The pilot is still on board, 
with the astrogator and the 
ncreee. I am only the commum- 
cations officer. Why did you as- 
dume I was alone?” 



L ouis sighed and let his arm 
fall. “Because I’m stupid,” 
he said bitterly. “Because you 
used the singular pronoun, or my 
computer did. Because I thought 
you were a gambler.” 

“I gambled that you would not 
see my ship take off, that you 
would be distracted by the coin, 
that you could see only from the 
front of your head. The risks 
seemed better than one-half.” 
Louis nodded. It all seemed 
clear. 

“There was also the chance 
that you had lured me down to 
destroy me.” The computer was 
still translating into first person 
singular. “I have lost at least 





one exploring sfiip tKat flew in 
this direction.” 

“Not guilty. So have we.” A 
thought struck him, and He said, 
“Prove that you Hold a we^jon.” 

The alien obliged. No beam 
showed, but sand exploded to 
Louis’s left, with a vicious Crackl 
and a fla^' the color of lightning. 
The alien held something that 
made Holes. 

And that was all. Louis bent 
and picked up the coin. “As long 
as we’re here, shall we finish the 
game?” 

“To vdiat purpose?” 

“To see who would have won. 
Doesn’t jrour species gamble for 
pleasure?” 

“To what purpose? We gamble 
for survival.” 

“Then Finagle take your whole 
breed I” he snarled and flung 
himself to the sand. His chance 
for glory was gone, tricked away 
from him. There is a dde that 
governs men’s affairs . and 
there went the ebb, carrying sta- 
tues to Louis Wu, histmy books 
naming Louis Wu, jetsam on the 
tide. 

“Your attitude is puzzling. One 
gambles only when gambling is 
necessary.” 

“Nuts.” 

“My translator will not trans- 
late that comment” 

“Do you know what that arti- 
fact is?” 

“I know of the species wHo 

96 



built that artifact They traveled 
far.” 

“We’ve never found a stasis 
box that tug. It must be a vault 
of some kind.” 

“It is thought that that species 
used a single weapon to end their 
war and all its participants.” 

The two looked at each other. 
Possibly each was thinking the 
same thing. What a disaster, if 
any but my own species should 
take this ultimate weapon! 

But that was anthropomorphic 
thinking. Louis knew that a kzin 
would have been saying. Now I 
cem conquer the universe, as is 
my ri^ht. 

“Finagle take my luck!” said 
Louis Wu between his teeth. 
“Why did you have to show up 
at the same time I did?” 

"That was not entirely chance. 
My instruments found your craft 
as you backed into the system. 
To reach the vicinity of the arti- 
fact in time, it was necessary to 
use thrust that damaged my ship 
and killed one of my crew. I 
earned possession of the artifact.” 

“By cheating, damn you!” 
Louis stood up ... 

And something meshed be- 
tween his brain and his semicir- 
cular canals.

/^ne gravity. 

The den^ty of a planet’s 
GALAXY 




nlmospHere depended on its grav- 
ity, and on its moon. A big moon 
tvoold sldm away most of tlie

years of a world’s evolution. A

Ilf Eaitb! sHould Have onbreatE-

But this planet had no moon. 
Except — 

The alien said something, a 
atartled ejaculation that the com- 
puter refused to translate. 
'‘Scree! Where did the water go?” 

Louis kxiked. What He saw 
piBzled him only a moment. The 
ocean had receded, slipped im- 
perceptibly away, until what 
ihowed now was Half a mile of 
level, slickly shining sea bottom. 

‘*Where did the water go? I do 
not understand.” 

“I do.” 

“Where did it go? Without a 
moon, there can be no tides. 
Tides are not this quick in any 
case. Explain, please.” 

“It’ll be eaaer if we use the 
telescope in my drip.” 

“In your ship there may be 
weapons.” 

“Now pay attention,” said 
Louis. “Your ship is very close 
to total destruction. Nothing can 
Have your crew but the com laser 
In my ship.” 

The alien dithered, then capitu- 
lated. “If you Have weapons, you 
woirid have used them earlier. 
THERE IS A TIDE 



You caimot stop my ship now. 
Let us enter your slrip. Remem- 
ber that I hold my wesson.” 

The alien stood beside lum. 
His month working disturbingly 
around serrated edges of his teeth 
as Louis activated the scope 
screen. Shortly a starfield appear- 
ed, as did a conical spacecraft, 
painted green with darker green 
markings. Along the bottom of 
the screen was the blur of thick 
atmosphere. 

“You see;? The artifact must hie 
nearly to the horizon. It moves 
fast.” 

“That fact is obvious even to 
low intelligence.” 

“Yah. Is it obvious to you that 
this world must have a massive 
satellite?” 

“But it does not the 

satellite is invisible.” 

“Not invisible. Just too small 
to notice. But then, it must be 
very dense.” 

The alien didn’t answer. 

“Why did we assume the sphere 
was a Slaver stasis box? Its shape 
was wrong; its size was wrong. 
But it was shiny, like the surface 
of a stasis field, and RpTiprifni 
like an artifact Plaiiets ace 
spheres too, but gravity wouldn’t 
ordinarily pull something ten feet 
wide into a sphere. RitKpf it 
would have to be very flnid^ or 
it would have to be very den<}^ 
Do you understand }ne?” 

“Na” 



97 




“I don’t know how your equip- 
ment works. My deep-radar uses 
a hyperwave pulse to find stasis 
boxes. When something stops a 
hyperwave pulse, it’s either a 
stasis box, or it’s denser than 
degenerate matter, the matter in- 
side a normal star. And this ob- 
ject is dense enough to cause 
tides.” 

A tiny silver bead Had drifted 
■^into view ahead of the cone. 
Telescopic foreshortening seemed 
to bring it right alongside the 
ship. Louis reached to scratch at 
his beard and was stopped by his 
faceplate. 

“I believe I understand you. 
But how could it happen?” 
“That’s guesswork. Well?” 
“Call my ship. They would be 
killed.” 

“I had to be sure you wouldn’t 
stop me.” Louis Wu went to 
work. Presently a light glowed; 
the computer had found the alien 
ship with its com laser. 

He spoke without prelimin- 
aries. “You must leave the spher- 
ical object immediately. It is not 
an artifact. It is ten feet of nearly 
solid neutronium, probably torn 
loose from a neutron star.” 

There was no answer, of 
course. The alien stood behind 
Him but did not speak. Probably 
His own ship’s computer could 
not Have handled the double 
translation. But the alien was 
98 



making one two-armed gesture, 
over and over. 

The green cone swung sharply 
around, broadside to the tele- 
scope. 

“Good, they’re firing lateral,” 
said Lew to himself. “Maybe they 
can do a Hyperbolic past it.” He 
raised His voice. “Don’t spare the 
horses. Cancel, damnit. Use all 
the power available. You must 
pull away.” 

The two objects seemed to be 
pulling apart. Louis suspected 
that that was illusion, for the two 
objects were almost in line-of- 
sight. “Don’t let the small mas? 
fool you,” He said, unnecessarily 
now. “Computer, wHafs the mass 
of a ten-foot neutronium sphere? 
Around two times ten to tHe min- 
us six times the mass of this 
world, which is pretty tiny, but 
if you get too close .... Com- 
puter, what’s the surface gravity? 
I don’t believe it.” 

The two objects seemed to be 
pulling together again. Damn, 
thought Louis. If they Hadn’t 
come along, that’d be me. 

He kept talking. It wouldn’t 
matter now, except to relieve his 
own tension, “My computer says 
ten million gravities at the sur- 
face. That may be off. Newton’s 
formula for gravity. Can you 
Hear me?” 

“They are too close,” said the 
alien. “By now it is too late to 
save tHeir lives.” 



GALAXY 




t was happening as he ^oke. 
The ship began to crumble a 
fraction of a second before im- 
pact. Impact looked no more 
dangerous Khan a cannonball 
striking the wall of a fort. The 
tiny silver bead simply swept 
through the side of the ship. But 
the ship closed instantly, all in 
a moment, like tinsel paper in a 
strong man’s fist. Closed into a 
tiny sphere. A tiny sphere ten 
feet through or a bit more. 

“I mourn,” said the alien. 
“Now I get it,” said Loob. “I 
wondered what was foaling our 
laser messa^s. That duink of 
neutronium was li^it between 
our ships bendkig fight beams.” 
“WI7 was this trap set for us? 
Have we eaemies so powerful that 
they caa ploy widi such masses?” 
A toodB of paranoia? Louis 
wo n dered. Maybe the whole spe- 
cies had it. “Just a toodi of coin- 
cidence. A smashed n eu tr on star.” 
For a time the alien did not 
speak. The te le s co p e , for want erf 
a better target, remained focused 
on the bead. Its glow had died. 

The alien said, “My pressure 
suit will not keep me alive long.” 
“We’ll make a run for it. I can 
reach Margrave in a couple of 
weeks. If you can hold out that 
long, we’ll set up a tailored en- 
vironment box to Hold you until 
we think of something better. It 
only takes a couple of hours to 
set one up. I’ll call ahead.” 

100 



The alien’s triple gaze converg- 
ed on him. “Can you send mes- 
sages faster than light?” 

“Sure.” 

“You Have knowledge worth’ 
trading for. I’D come with you.” 
“Thanks a whole lot.” Louis 
Wu started punching buttons. 
“Margrave. Civilization. People. 
Faces. Voices. Bah.” The ship 
leapt upward, ripping atmosphere 
apart. Cabin gravity wav ere d a 
little then settled down.

Tt was quiet in the zoo now. 
-*■ Bailey couM hear the ocean 
booming down in the valley, miles 
from where he was hiding. 

He crawled from under tiie lit- 
tle footbridge and checked his 
watch. Ten-twenty. He wished it 
was darker, but they’d left the 
lights on in the elephant house 
across the way. Each of its tall 
windows cast a bar-shadowed 
beam into the quadrangle. Un- 
rippled, the seal pool at his left 
gave back perfect reflections. 

Silhouettes of walking men 
crossed it. Bailey ducked back 
under and heard them come out 
of the big house, toward him. 
They shuffled across overhead. 



talking quietly, then crunched 
out of earshot down the graveled 
path toward the admin building. 
That would be those three holo- 
graphic technicians, changing the 
tapes, he thought. Wonder what 
they’ll show tomorrow. 

He stuck his head out again. 
New windows lit up down at the 
admin building, the control room. 
Faint mechanical noises drifted 
out to him, followed by the 
squeal of an elephant. It came 
twice more completely, but the 
fourth blast was cut off midway, 
and Tantor subsided in a pop of 
static. Distant laughter. Then the 
lights in the elephant house went 
out.

Bailey scrambled up the low 
bank, dragging his pack behind. 
Though the cuffs of his black 
trouseis shone wetly, his feet still 
comfortably dry in their boots. 
A pale line showed where the 
dark Jersey^'had crept up to ex- 
pose an inch of his thin white 
belly. He tugged it back down. 

His first step toward the live- 
animal compound seemed to 
make all the noise in the world. 
Maybe he should go around on 
the grass outside the quadrangle 
of buildings. He dianged course 
and slipped between the bear pits 
and the aviary. Someone had left 
the birds on, though the sound 
was off. 

He stopped and watched the 
tape run through, he couldn’t help 
it. A smile crossed his wrinkled 
face, and the man could feel his 
pulse rate slow back down to 
normal. Thirty birds danced in 
the free air there, breathtakingly 
real. It was as if he was back in 
Asheville forty years ago. That 
cardinal there, fluttering so bold- 
ly forward to the front of the 
cage, like the one his sister used 
to feed from the back veran- 
da ... 

There was a click and a faint 
discontinuity of motion as the 
tape turned over for a rerun. 
There hadn’t been a cardinal alive 
since the floods began. 

Tearing himself away, Bailey 
slipped along the rows of empty 
102 



cages. The overstuffed knapsack 
kept brushing things. Working his 
way from the admin building to- 
ward the live animal compouml, 
he stopped at the last comer and 
peered carefully around it. 

'"T^here it stood, dominating one 
whole side of the square. 
Eight feet of hurricane fence, out- 
lining an eighty by two hundred 
foot rectangle. Inside was an 
empty corridor in which two men 
with rifles paced endlessly, then 
another fence like the first. There 
were batteries of floodlights at 
either end of the compound, and 
Bailey could plainly see the old 
collie where she lay sleeping on 
the grass near the middle. Men 
guarding dogs, Bailey thought, 
times have changed. But Hilda 
was twenty per cent of the dogs 
in die world. 

Backing out of sight again, 
Bailey heaved off his knapsack 
and sat down. He pushed the 
jumper cables to one side and 
carefully unwrapped the air pis- 
tol. The bottle of bourbon had 
leaked a little. Where were the 
darts? Good grief, he hadn’t for- 
gotten — no, he hadn’t. The test 
tube bounced out on the ground 
when he shook the flap. Bailey 
took a deep breath and tried to 
calm himself. 

When he unstoppered the tube 
the familiar smell of Amtol waft- 
ed up to him. Fishing each of the 

GALAXY 




six tiny darts out by its tufts with 
forceps, Bailey dropped them in- 
to the magazine of !Us pistol. He 
poured the excess sedative in 
after them, stoppered the tube, 
closed the gun. 

Bailey dropped the thing in his 
lap and stared at it. He had that 
empty, waiting feeling, wonder- 
ing if he had the nerve. After all, 
it was no skin off his nose if 
they wanted to start the new 
world without animals. He wasn’t 
going to make the trip, himself. 
He became aware of the angry 
ocean again, snarling through the 
West Virginia valleys like a wait- 
ing tiger .... 

They^d turned the tiger loose 
twenty years earlier with two 
surprisingly small bombs. One 
was a routine blast by the New 
Zealanders to trigger seismo- 
graphic echoes in the Antarctic. 
The other was a mistake, when 
the French got two for the price 
of one on their north Australian 
test facility. 

There was talk later of timing 
and the earth’s crust resonating. 
Both continents settled about a 
foot, and the seafloor between 
them rose a quarter mile. It was 
still going up, and the rest of the 
world was being flooded by the 
displaced water, 

Man’s adaptable. The survivors 
headed for high ground, scratch- 
ed out a living. But nearly every 
animal in the world died. En-

vironments shifted too widely for 
them, food drains broke wd tried 
to reform along unworkable linee^ 

For two decades people had 
been watching the water rise 
around them. Some tried to build 
arks, failed. As far as anyone in 
Charleston, West Virgnua could 
tell, theirs was the last one^ 
They’d dug a hole in the moun- 
taintop and intended to cool it 
by nuclear power to cryogenic 
temperatures. Fourteen people 
would be sealed inside, to be au- 
tomatically awakened in eleven 
himdred years when the waters 
subsided. 

Fourteen people, no animals. 
That’s what got Bailey. Noah 
hadn’t dcxie it that way. And even 
though he wasn’t one of the for- 
tunate fourteen, the thought of 
a new world where men were 
without a single companion spe- 
des appalled him. 

|~\etermined again, Bailey got 
up and shoved the pistol in 
his hip pocket. He opened the 
bourbon bottle, took a deep 
breath, and began to sing. 

“Oh, I was bor-m in east Vir- 
gin-yaah — ’’ He rounded the 
comer, staggered, swore. 

“Nor’ Car’li-ina I did ro-oam 
....’’ Bailey waved the bottle, 
sloshing some on his sleeve. Both 
the guards heard him and stopped 
where they stood, but they hadn’t 
spotted him yet. 



103 




“There I met me-ee a fair pret- 
ty maidea-n . They saw 
him. The big one at the far ead 
of the compound began to run up 
toward fais younger companion. 
The nearer^raised his rifle uncer- 
tainly. 

“Her name and a-age I do 
not kno-ow . ” Bailey was at 
the fence now, stumbled forward 
against it. The pistol almost slid 
out ot his hip pocket. He lurched, 
a seraphic smile on his face, sa- 
luted the nearer guard with the 
bourbon and subtly pushed the 
gun back in fdace. 

“Her hair it wa-as of a bright- 
some color . ” 

“Hey Ed, who in — ?” said the 
big one as he came up. 

“Some drunk. Don’t know bow 
he got past the main gate.” 

“And her li-ips were rooby re- 
ed,” Bailey sang. “Here y’are, 
guys, how ’bout a?” He proffered 
the fifth, clumsily trying to get 
it through the wire mesh. 

“Come on Mac, cut the crap,” 
said the smaller guard. “You 
don’t belong in here.” He lower- 
ed liis rifle. The other one said, 
‘TH call admin- Give ’em hell, 
letting a bum in here.” He turned, 
headed for the call box which 
hung on a fencepnst a few paces 
away. 

Bailey had fallen to the ground 
and dropped his bottle. Rolling 
half over in the grass, he rubbed 
the pistol free and got it between 

104 



his heels. Then he rose as far as 
his knees. “Aw now, fellas, don’ 
go gettin’ mad.” 

“You’re drunk, Grandpop,” the 
young guard said disgustedly. 

Chug. 

The other turned at tiie un- 
familiar sound, his hand on the 
receiver. “Ed?” 

Chug. 

TJailey stood up and thrust the 
pistol back in his pocket. 
Both guards lay on the grass in- 
side the compound. The first had 
fallen across his rifle, and his arm 
was twisted around it awkwardly. 
The second was flat on his back, 
but had fumbled the receiver off 
its hook before he’d fallen. Bailey 
would have to hurry. 

He trotted back for his pack. 
Returning, he ran the jumper 
cables between two consecutive 
fenceposts and then went to work 
on the mesh between them. Ap- 
parently he’d done it right, no 
alarm sounded. 

Tightness in his lungs reminded 
Bailey of his heart. He slowed, 
counted to a hundred, resumed 
cutting. The wire cutters were 
clumsy things. 

It was so damn quiet. Roused 
by the earlier noise, Hilda had 
come over and sniffed at the 
guard who lay against the inside 
fence. Bailey called softly, sooth- 
ing her. Hilda was sixteen years 
old and blind. She wa^ed once. 

GALAXY 




then waddled back to her old spot 
and threw herself down with a 
sigh. 

Bailey thought he could get 
through. Wriggling under the 
four-loop slit he’d made, he got 
about as far as his chest and had 
to wriggle back again. His shirt 
had ripped, and tiiere was a little 
blood underneath. He opened the 
mesh two more loops. His hands 
looked old, working away in the 
hard glare of the floodlights. This 
time he made it. 

Scrambling across to the call 
box, he stepped over die bigger 
guard and raised the receiver 
cautiously to his ear. Nothing, 
not even a buzz. Was that good 
or bad? He didn’t know. He re- 
placed it, then went over and 
straightened the kid’s twisted 
arm from around his rifle. A 
quick professional glance told 
him that it wasn’t broken, and 
Bailey felt relieved. 

Reaching back through the hole 
for his knapsack, he got up and 
went around the guard aisle to 
the inner gate. They’d left it 
open. He went across the dewy 
grass into the live animal house. 

The ticket booth was open too, 
fortunately. As he snatched the 
keys from the hook inside the 
door, Bailey smelled the boiling 
coffee. He stepped quickly across 
the little cubicle and snapped off 
the hotplate. Now, where were 
the new tickets? He yanked open 
BAILEY'S ARK 



the cupboard under the sign 
which read, “Admission $3, 
Children $1.” There they were, 
four rolls of them, three white 
end one blue. Holding his knap- 
sack under the shelf, he swept 
them all in. 

Bailey swung back out the door 
and down the short corridor into 
the darkened main hall of the 
building. The raccoon was up, 
prowling back and forth under 
the small red light at the back of 
his pen. Assorted chirps and 
squeaks came from the far wall, 
where the last known living fami- 
ly of chipmunks had lived in in- 
bred idiocy for ten years. 

Bailey faced right, walked 
down the line of cages, counting, 
his hand dragging tentatively 
along the heavy brass rail. Can- 
ada Jay, Parula Warbler, Lreast 
Tern .... He stopped at the 
Killdeer’s cage. 

Qwitching on his flashlight, he 
peered in on two slender, 
sleepy birds. The male was perch- 
ed by the window to his outdoor 
cage, and when the light hit him 
he flew out. But the female seem- 
ed unruffled and didn’t move 
from her nest. Bailey slid under 
the rail and opened the door with 
the third key he tried. She 
squawked indignantly and flew 
out to join her mate. Bailey heard 
them take up that high, bisyllabic 
cry of theirs and frowned. They 

105 




could probably hear that down 
at admin. 

Holding each brown-on-brown 
blotched egg over the lens of his 
light, Bailey smiled quickly twice, 
grimaced, then grimaced again. 
Two duds. That settled that, the 
chances of the remaining two 
both being of the same sex were 
dangerously high. He replaced 
all four as close to the way he^d 
found them as possible. 

Shutting the cage, he glanced 
wistfully back at the nest. Too 
bad, they were so small. They’d 
have been so much easier to hide. 

He walked quickly down to the 
end and threw his beam into the 
biggest cage in the room. Perched 
hi^ on a deed stump, the only 
other brooding i>air of birds in the 
world peered proudly down with 
cruel eyes. Ospres^. Bailey dread- 
ed going in there. 

From behind him came the 
faint but unmistakable ring of the 
phone. The edges of Bailey’s field 
of vision flared brilliantly, and His 
lungs blew up in his chest. 

Fumbling open the phial, he 
got the tablet down as he went. 
He made it to the phone in the 
ticket-seller’s cage before it Had 
rung twice more. 

“Saul?” demanded an irritated 
voice in the receiver. “Ed?” 

Clearing his throat, Bailey tried 
to remember the flat tenor of the 
kid. “It’s Ed,” he said. “What is 
it?” 

106 



“What is it, what’s with you? 
I thought I heard those birds and 
when I called the other phono 
you didn’t answer.” 

“Just having some coffee.” 
“Both together? You guys 
know better than that.” 

“Sorry.” 

“Sorry he says. Now get the 
hell back out there.” There was 
a loud click, then the line went 
dead. 

Bailey hung up, stumbled over 
to the bench and leaned against 
it Actually, it was a lucky break. 
He’d probably not be bothered 
now. But it occurred to him that 
one more onset of angina would 
probably kill him. 

T)ailey hurried back out into the 
dark roomful of cages. He 
should tackle the birds rnider the 
influence of that last pill. It 
would help, certainly. Maybe he 
ought to alter his plans and hit 
them each with a dart. But no, 
two unconscious birds would give 
away the whole thing. Once they 
discovered the eggs were stolen 
it would be obvious who’d done 
it. He’d said too much in public. 

So Bailey put on the heavy 
vest, gloves and hood he’d 
brought, and loaded the water 
gun with ammonia. Then he 
opened the cage and went in. The 
shale rocks on the left wall of the 
cage would eventually bring him 
within reaching distance. He took 

GALAXY 




a last look up at the unruly bale 
of sticks that served as an eyrie. 
It was twenty feet from the floor. 
Then he started to climb. 

Bailey could see the female 
turn nervously to face him, 
though not rising from the eggs. 
The male stood more erectly, 
opening his beak, hunching his 
shoulders and hissing. 

Ospreys lay somewhere be- 
tween hawks and eagles. They 
caught fish by diving for them, 
so people used to call them fish 
hawks. And perched, they weren’t 
larger than hawks. Their bellies 
and throats were a clear white, 
and their backs, slate gray. 

In a sort of lethal way they 
were almost attractive. Unless 
you dwelt too long on their heads 
or feet, or until they spread their 
wings. Those parts were an 
eagle’s. 

Bailey was halfway up when 
the male launched himself from 
the nest. In the dim light he 
could have sworn those black- 
barred wings reached from one 
wall to the other, but he knew 
better. Only six feet. He locked 
his heels in a shale fissure and 
backed securely against the ledge. 

The osprey preee’d twice, buf- 
feting the air in a larruping hover 
not two feet from Bailey’s face. 
He could smell the thing even 
under his hood, foul and fishy 
and diarp. Those talons were as 
big as his own hands, and they

chopped in unison — open to- 
ward him, closed away — with 
each beat of the huge wings. Bai- 
ley opened fire with the ammonia. 

That shrill scream again. Tal- 
ons slamming against his chest 
like the open-palmed thrust of a 
bully, then closing. Cloth and 
plastic ripping, beartraps in the 
meat of his bosom. Bailey fired 
again. A dull hatchet battering 
at the lenses of his mask, head 
slipping backward and bouncing 
on the rock, things turning red. 
Bailey fired again. His own 
scream, the bird’s scream, the 
round gray tongue seen through 
a cracked lens, the other lens 
cracking, beartraps gone. Bird 
gone. 

The female followed. Bailey 
scrambled tKe rest of the way up, 
and reached across two feet of 
empty air to the nest in the crotch 
of the tall stump. 

Four eggs, red and gold on 
brown, round, hensize. Into the 
foam stockings, into the sac of 
gel, into his shirt 

Birds outside screaming to 
high heaven, voices from the 
other end of the zoo, ninning feet 
on gravel. From the other pocket 
came four false eggs, plastic, 
carefully painted. Into the nest. 

Bailey swung down, jiunped 
the last four feet. 

Wipe up the blood. His. Out 
of the cage and lock it. Into the 
little room to replace the keys. 

107 




Outside. Up from the waterfoun- 
tain to the window ledge to the 
porch roof to the main roof. Over 
to the ledge. Heart again, but not 
so bad. Lay off the pills, use the 
serum. ; 

Bailey slid tiie syringe into his 
left buttock. The warm feeling 
spread, enveloping his groin, his 
belly, his screaming chest and 
finally his head. People were 
shouting down below, but their 
voices seemed blurred. Every- 
thing was lowing down. He'd be 
unable to run if they discovered 
him, he knew. But if he could 
run and did, the run would kill 
him. Preee/ he heard. Pre iM'e pre. 
Silly birds, he was doing it for 
their own good. Dogs barking. 
Stupor coming. Make it through 
the lught if they don’t find me 
up here, Bailey thought. 

''T^hey didn’t. At ten-thirty the 
next morning, Bailey awoke. 
He gazed straight up into a gray- 
sky through two cracked lenses. 
When he took off the heavy hood, 
each movement of each muscle 
was an intricate study in pain. 
Then he lay there for a while, 
because things wouldn’t focus. 

The eggs. Incautiously, Bailey 
sat bolt upright, to find himself 
looking over the low roof wall at 
a burgeoning crowd of zoo-goers 
down in front of the building. He 
ducked again. 

The knapsack was still on his 
108 



back, he’d been lying on it. Per- 
haps that accounted for the state 
of his neck. Oh, no, he remember- 
ed the ospr^. Sliding the straps 
up, Bailey shrugged away hum 
the bulky pack. Pombfing 
through die >(mk inside, he found 
the gelsac. Four ai>ples of foam 
sfaoclqM'oohng floated within the 
translucent slime. He carefully 
opened the sac, then each of the

Removing the eggs, he held 
them up to the cloudy sun and 
peered at the shadowy creatures 
inside. He smiled, d>en repacked 
the eggs. That done, he concen- 
trated on his wounds. 

There were painful lumps all 
over his bead, but nothing serious. 
Removing the thick vest, he

He listened to the chatter down 
below. A thousand dollars worth 
of tickets had been stolen the 
night before. Screwy, eh? Why 
take on two armed guards for 
some tickets that could be voided 
anyway? Oh, a couple of diunks, 
two of them, at least No sense 
to it. Could see it if they stole 
the dogs. Meat, you know. Some 
people are really to be hung up 
on it. No, I haven’t either. But 
a lot of older people have. 
Screwy, eh? But they left the 
dogs alone, the screwballs. 

It was exactly what Bailey 
wanted to hear. He edged across 
the roof to peer down over the 
back door. Most people used the 
front, but there was a crowd of 
kids at the back now. He’d have 
to wait. 

Tn a few minutes a young woman 
-*• came out and led them away. 
With no one in sight, Bailey drop- 
ped to the porch roof, then from 
rhe sill to the fountain to the 
ground. A middle-aged man came 
out as he struck earth, but Bailey 
pretended to be tying a shoe. 

Going around front, he mingled 
with the outgoing stream of peo- 
ple, turning his face as they pass- 
ed the guards. But no worry, the 
two he’d seen were off duty.- He 
stopped at the seal pond, agreed 
casually with an old woman 
there, who said it wasn’t very 
good, holograms don’t splash. 

no 



Then, one hand cupped self- 
consciously over the camera case, 
Bailey went out the main gate of 
the zoo. 

He’d brought it off. 

Bailey suppressed a cheer; his 
step was unusually light. A ten- 
minute walk brought him to the 
West Virginia State Hospital, 
where he worked. Checking in, 
he smiled affably at the head 
nurse, who waved with a curious 
grin. Of course, he thought rue- 
fully, I need a shave. 

Bailey went down to the base- 
ment, past a sign that said, “Re- 
stricted to ARK persormel only,” 
and into his office. 

He showered, shaved, dressed 
the cuts on his stomach and chest. 
Opening a can of peas, he took 
it along with a handful of supple- 
mental wafers over to his desk, 
Janie’d brought the newspaper, 
and it waited there. 

Nothing new. The colwiy over 
at GofPs Mountain was gone for 
sure, but most people had known 
that for weeks. There was a vita- 
min B 12 shortage. The tides now 
swept as high as the old glass 
factory, and the available land 
area of Charleston had shrunk 
another two per cent. Best pre- 
diction of total deluge remained 
the same at six and a half years. 
Some ninny had broken into the 
zoo. 

Good enough, Bailey thought 
and tossed down the paper. Fin- 

GALAXY 




ishing the peas, he noticed the 
date on tiie can. Thirty-four years 
old, borderline. They shouldn’t 
really be issuing this stuff. He 
made a note. Then he went 
through his IN box. 

Right on top was the memo 
he’d sent the Board. As usual, 
they hadn’t honored him with a 
formal reply. Typed on the back 
of his own note was the usual 
red-printed rebuff. 

Dear Dr. Bailey; 

Your idea of ctyoiyini unborn 
puppies to accompany the human 
occupants of the ARK. is touch- 
ing. in its sentimentality. But, 
Doctor, you know better them 
that. 

How many reasons do you 
need? First of all, nobody sched- 
uled for preservation in the ARK 
wants them. Second, while the 
danger of contamination is slight, 
it’s real. Finally and most signif- 
icantly, the ark’s limited capa- 
city precludes taking on any but 
human cargo. 

To elaborate on this: even if 
you could reduce the puppies to 
less than five pounds, ( which des- 
pite your considerable abilities 
we doubt), you’d still be requir- 
ing the human occupants of the 
ARK to lose a collective five 
pounds of body weight to make 
room. You know the dynamics of 
cryobiology as well as we do. 
Doctor, and such action could 
well be fatal. 

BAILEY'S ARK 



It may interest you that the 
latest estimate of re-emergence 
has been moved up to fifteen hun- 
dred years, which makes fat stor- 
age even more critical. 

We’re aware of your feelings 
about animals, but these requests 
of yours are becoming a nuisance. 
Believe us when we say that ani- 
mals aren’t needed, aren’t wanted, 
aren’t possible in the new world.

For the Board 

Scribbled underneath in red 
pencil was a note from Amie him- 
self, “Come on, Dave, lay off, 
will you?’’ 

B ailey wadded the thing up and 
hurled it across the room. 
Getting up, he went into the lav- 
atory and brought out the eggs. 
An afterthought, he buzzed his 
secretary. 

“Janie?” he said into the grille. 
“Good morning, Doctor.” 
“What’s on?” 

“Nothing just now. Gordon Al- 
ton at one.” 

“All right. I’ll be analyzing 
prints till then. Don’t let anyone 
in, eh?” 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

It was almost noon. He’d have 
to hurry to be ready for yoimg 
Gordon. Bailey primed the auto- 
clave, left the vent open, switched 
it on. He got the resin from his 
lower desk drawer. 

Dipping the teflon cloths in the 

m 




fluid, he patted them into place 
on each of the eggs. He wished 
they weren’t so big. When he 
opened the autoclave only a few 
wisps of steam escaped, the rest 
having gone out the vent Good. 
The stuff wjls supposed to cure 
in dry heat, but this would prob- 
ably do. 

Now to set up the ruse. The 
kid had an eidetic memory, so 
no need to overdo it. Bailey got 
out a plaster model of a man’s 
wrist, splinted it, bound it doused 
it with resin. 

Into the autoclave it went, and 
Bailey set the timer. 

Forty minutes later it rang, and 
ten after that, Janie buzzed. That 
would be Gordon. He told her to 
send him in. 

The door opened a cautious 
six inches, and most of a chubby 
freckled face appeared five and a 
half feet from the floor. Bailey 
smiled and beckoned. “Come on 
in, Gordon.” With the awkward- 
ness of extreme weight, Gordon 
Alton crossed and took a chair. 
He was twelve and ptarentless, the 
only survivor of a family lost 
when Wheeling had gone under. 
His IQ was close to two hundred, 
and he was one of the fourteen 
people going into the ARK. 

He sat politely and watched 
as Bailey labored to remove a 
plastic cast from a plaster model 
of a hand. The doctor had ap-

and was spitting on the thing to 
soften the plastic. 

“That’s pretty neat. Doc.” 
“One of the marvels of modern 
medicine,” Bailey said ruefully. 
“Oh, to hell with it.” Bailey shov- 
ed- it into his lower desk drawer, 
his point made. 

He folded his hands on the 
desk, looked up and smiled. 
“How’ve you been, Gordon?” 
“Oh, okay. They gave me a 
sending-off p>arty yesterday, and 
all the girls cried.” 

“Well, that’s women. Did you 
make your weight?” 

The boy looked ruefully down 
at his enormous stomach. “Just 
two-thirty. Guess that ought to 
hold me for a thousand years.” 
“Fifteen hundred’s the latest 
guess.” 

“Oh?” Gordon was silent for 
a while. “We going to the zoo?” 
Bailey played it cool. “If you 
want to.” 

“Yeah, I guess so.” 

T>ailey got up, took his jacket 
off the hook, patting the 
breast pocket to check. He wasn’t 
sure what good the dartgun 
would be if he was recognized, 
but it made him feel better to 
have it. 

They left the hospital and 
headed across town. 

Bailey paid for the tickets at 
the main gate, and they went 
into the zoo. Gordon hadn’t said 

GALAXY 




mucfr. Naturally he’d be subdued, 
Bailey reminded himself, he’s 
going under tonight. 

Aloud he said, “Let’s try the 
elephants, I think they’ve chang- 
ed the tapes.” As they crossed the 
footbridge over the seal pool’s 
spiTIway, Bailey smiled. 

The elephant house did not 
smell of elephants, it smelled of 
cigarettes and the stickiness of 
melted ice cream, like a movie 
theater on Saturday afternoon. 
A few adults and a lot of children 
gazed in on the display. 

“Grandma saw a real elephant 
once, Sally,” an old woman said. 
“Hack before the floods. We used 
to feed them.” 

Sally shrugged. But as Tantor 
cfumped past with his trunk ex- 
tended for peanuts, she tossed 
part of her sucker. It went 
throu^ the image to join the 
other wasted gifts on the floor. 
Bailey winced. 

Gordbn caught it. “You know, 
Rrctor Hailey, you old guys am 
amazing.” 

“You’re getting to like animals, 
aren’t you, Gordon?” 

“Weil, sort of. But not like you. 
Doc, not Bke you old guy s. I 
like it when you bring me to the 
zoo and all.” The round freckled 
face frowned. “Hut you know.” 

Bail^ nodded and they d r i fted 
out of the elephant house. No, 
yon can’t just tell someone to 
love something. But there was 
BAttEf’S ARK 



still his last card. “Letfs go to the 
live animals, Gordon.” 

Out on the perimeter of the 
compound, the guard called Saul 
was talking throu^ the fence to 
two small boys. 

Bailey paid again, and they 
went in. With more enthusiasm 
now, Gordon went over to the 
killdeer’s cage, “You’re right. 
Doc. So those are eggs, the real 
thing.” The boy leaned over the 
rail, resting on his paimch and 
eventually lifting up his feet. 
“Sa-ay.” 

Bhiley gazed down at the back 
of the round, curly head. Sa-ay. 
Was that a say of curiosity, or 
a say of honest wonder? He could 
hope. 

At any rate, this seemed like 
the right time. Leaving the boy, 
Bailey went over to the keeper. 

“Hello, Mr. Hart.” 

“Oh, hi Doctor, How’re you 
today?” 

“Fine. Listen. I brought him, 
he’s with me now.” 

Hart tilted the blhe cap back 
on his head. “The one that’s going 
in the ARK, eh? That one?” He 
pointed. 

“No, the heavyset boy to the 
left. Do you think we could do 
what I asked you about?” 

Hart grimaced. “Yah, guess so. 
Don’t tell ’em down at admin, 
though.” 

Bailey went over and retrieved 
Gordon, then propelled him by 

113 




the shoulder after Hart’s retreat- 
ing back. He led them to a work- 
room adjacent to the ticket win- 
dow and snapped on the light. 

"D linking blipd eyes, Hilda rais- 
ed her head from a box by 
the window. Gordon jumped 
backward. 

“He’s loose!’’ 

Bailey went over and crouched 
by the old collie. “It’s a she, Gor- 
don. Hilda. Want to pet her?” 

The boy edged across the floor. 
Hilda inclined a muzzle toward 
him, nostrils going. Her heavy 
tail thumped once, tentatively, 
against the side of the box. 

Gordon squatted beside and a 
little behind Bailey. He took the 
boy’s hand and guided it to Hil- 
da’s thick white ruff. 

“Like this?” 

“Yes, Gordon.” 

Hart coughed politely after a 
few minutes. Bailey stood up, 
then bent down and gently moved 
Hilda’s head from the boy’s lap. 
Gordon let himself be led out. 

“Well,” Bailey said with forced 
lightness. “Let’s take a look at 
the ospreys. They’re brooding, 
too.” 

They watched in silence for a 
few minutes. The female’s head 
peered imperiotisly down at them 
over the edge of her nest. Gordon 
got his voice back. “How long’ll 
she have to sit there before they 
hatch?” 

114 



“I don’t really know.” But of 
course he did. “It’s ah on the 
card there, down below. Look it 
over while I make a head run.” 

As Bailey walked down to the 
men’s room he was mentally rub- 
bing his hands together. Eidetic 
memory. All he has to do is read 
the card. 

He was washing his face when 
the stall behind him opened and 
the guard Ed’s eyes met his own 
in the mirror. 

“You!” 

The kid was fast. Bailey rolled 
but the billie still grazed his ear 
and smashed across his collar- 
bone. Turning, Bailey braced his 
left leg against the washbowl, 
put both hands squarely on the 
man’s chest and pushed. The 
blue uniform fell back into the 
stall. But Ed caught himself on 
the doorjamb, shouted again, 
raised the club for another blow. 
Bailey knew better than to match 
reflexes with a younger man. He 
backed quickly down the line of 
washstands. 

A head popped out of the last 
stall and was almost beared off 
as Ed crashed past toward Bailey, 
who was reaching for his gun. 

Chug. But the guard was on 
top of him; panicked, Bailey fired 
again. A man could die from two 
shots of the stuff. He’d have to — 

Now the bystander i>oked his 
head out again, saw the prostrate 
guard, began to yell. Bailey aimed 

GALAXY 




carefully, got him in the thick 
of the arm. 

Behind him the door was 
swinging open. Jamming the gun 
back in his jacket, Bailey shout- 
ed, “Help, help!” and bulled his 
way through the incoming crowd. 

“In there,” he called over his 
shoulder. “They’re sick, they need 
Anamtol,” and prayed someone 
heard and would remember. 

The room spun. Where were 
the piUs? No time to — here. Sag- 
ging against the wall, he fumbled 
the tablet into his mouth. 

Gordon trotted up, out of 
breath. “What is it?” 

“Never mind. Come on.” 

They were back at the hospital 
in a few minutes. Bailey made up 
enough of a story to at least stem 
Gordon’s tide of questions. 

T T e gave himself two hours un- 
til the bystander awoke and 
described him. Others in the 
crowd would be able to fill the 
picture in, since Bailey was a 
regular at the zoo. Altogether, he 
might have three hours. 

Which was enough. Gordon 
would be in the ARK by then. 

“You’d better go up to the prep 
room,” he told the boy. As he 
headed obediently for the door, 
Bailey had a thought. Maybe he 
should tell him what was going 
on. “Gordon.” 

“Yes?” 

God, he’s young. Brilliant or 
BAILEY'S ARK 



not, he’s still twelve. You don’t 
tell a twelve-year-old Idd you’ve 
been using him, or that he’s about 
to break most of the rules in the 
Board’s little book. Stick to your 
plan, man. “Nothing. Good 
Luck.” 

“Thanks, Doc. You’ve been 
great to me since my folks — ” 

Bailey’s conscience was bludg- 
eoning him. He lowered his eyes. 

“Well, all right,” the boy said. 
“But thanks for today, too.” 

They wheeled Gordon in an 
hour later in deep h3qx)tiiermia. 
Bailey had two operations to per- 
form on the boy’s pale body, be- 
fore passing him along for further 
work. These were both subcu- 
taneous insertions of crystalline 
hormones and drugs, which were 
to augment those expended by the 
body even while deep in cryo. 
They were easy operations. 

The only difficult part was in- 
stalling the pull tabs, so that they 
wouldn’t infect during the few 
hours between coming out of cryo 
and their removal. 

He made the two normal in- 
sertions in the loose fat over 
Gordon’s stomach. The third and 
fourth were placed carefully, so 
that the tab would be hidden in 
the fold of flesh between the boy’s 
upper thighs and buttocks. Two 
of the osprey’s eggs went in each. 

Once he found them, Gordon 
would know what to do.

the enormous power requirements 
for transmission of data to the 
ground. In reply I pointed out the 
distance of a satellite from the 
ground was to be only a few hun- 
dred miles and that radio waves 
did not care whether they trav- 
elled vertically or horizontally. 

Just one and a half years later 
the first artificial satellites went 
into orbit, and their signals could 
be received easily, even though 
they did not transmit with 
“enormous power.” 

Very soon after the beginning 
of the Space Age, in February 
1958, the first American artificial 
satellite Explorer I discovered 
what we now call the inner Van 
Allen belt. About a week later I 
listened to somebody being inter- 
viewed on a radio station about 
this discovery. Since not much 
was known at the moment the 
interviewee did not do badly; 
but then he said that this “radia- 
tion belt” would make communi- 
cation with ships in space nearly 
impossible. Obviously one could 
not transmit radio messages 
through such a belt. Unfortunate- 
ly you cannot talk back to your 
radio, but I tried. If I could have 
talked back I probably would 
have said that ttiere was no rea- 
son to think so, since radio beams 
do not interfere with each other. 

Then actual events began to 
move so fast that wrong predic- 
tions of this type became rare. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



There simply was not enough 
time between events to think up 
a major prediction that would 
miscarry. 

On January 2, 1959, the Rus- 
sians sent their “Cosmic Rocket 
No. 2” to the moon; even now it 
is not clear whether they tried 
for an impact or not. The space- 
craft missed the moon by about 
twice the moon’s diameter, and 
transmissions were still received 
after the device had passed the 
moon’s orbit. Transmissions did 
stop a few hours later — which 
is the reason for wondering 
whether the rocket was meant to 
strike the moon ; evidently battery 
power was supplied only for 
about the time it would need to 
reach the moon. At any event 
“Cosmic Rocket No. 2” had 
transmitted data over a distance 
of more than a quarter million 
miles. 

On March 11, 1960 the Ameri- 
can space probe Pioneer V was 
sent into orbit around the sun, 
and in this case transmissions 
were still received over a distance 
of about 22 million miles. 

On August 27, 1962 the plane- 
tary probe Mariner II took off 
for a flyby near the planet Venus. 
The flyby took place in Decem- 
ber 1962, and the maximum dis- 
tance over which signals had been 
successfully transmitted grew to 
54 million miles. 

Finally, planetary probe Mar-

iner IV took off for Mars on 
November 28, 1964, and it passed 
near the planet on July 14, 1965. 
The pictures taken during the 
flyby were ordered to be trans- 
mitted the following day. By 
then the distance from the earth 
exceeded 140 million miles. 

All of which means that com- 
munications over planetary dis- 
tances are within the state of the 
art. Of course improvements will 
be made and innovations will be 
introduced. But it can be done 
right now so that, in the discus- 
sion of a new project, nobody has 
to ask whether it is possible, the 
only question is “from where to 
where?” And this question now 
becomes the fundamental as- 
sumption for the discussion to 
follow. The “to where?” part is 
easy: to the earth. But “from 
where?” The answer to that de- 
pends on how far we are willing 
to look into tiie future at this 
moment. 

118 



L et us say that the time limit 
is the year 1980. 

Then the probable targets are 
those listed in Table I, though it 
must be added that Mercury 
should have a question mark. 
Mercury is the planet least often 
mentioned when the exploration 
of space is imder discussion. It 
isn’t that Mercury is without 
scientific interest; in fact its small 
size, its proximity to the sun and 
its slow rotation (2/3 of its orbit- 
al period of 88 days) make it a 
very interesting planet from the 
scientific point of view. But Mer- 
cury would be hard to reach. The 
plane of its orbit is inclined to the 
ecliptic by a full 7° of arc. Its 
orbital velocity is high, varying 
from 24J4 miles per second at 
its aphelion to nearly 30 miles per 
second at its perihelion. But a 
planetary probe approaching 
Mercury would be still faster, be- 
cause the gravitational pull of the 
sun had been acting upon it all

through its flight. If a flyby were 
to do any good, the speed of the 
probe would have to be drasti- 
cally reduced, which would mean 
a high fuel expenditure. In short, 
a mission to Mercury would be 
very expensive in terms of fuel. 

This leaves only three possible 
targets in that decade, not count- 
ing such a special case as a mis- 
sion to a comet and a possible 
flyby near one of the larger aster- 
oids. These targets are Venus, 
Mars and Jupiter. 

In the case of Venus, the HigH 
surface temperature — Mariner II 
reported it as 800° Fahrenheit 
while the instruments of Mariner 
V said “not less than 520° Fahr- 
enheit”; the latter figure agrees 
with the findings of Russian as- 
tronomers — will preclude man- 
ned landings for a long time to 
come. But we might imagine a 
space station of some sort in or- 
bit around Venus. 

Mars will have a ground station 
FOR YOUR INFOR/AATION 



at some time. Here nature has 
been good enough to supply two 
small moons that win facilitate 
exploration. I know that every 
one of my readers knows where 
to look such things up, but for 
the sake of convenience let us 
have a quick rundown of the per- 
tinent figures. Both moons are 
small with diameters estimated to 
be around 5 miles. The inner one, 
named Phobos, is only 5800 miles 
from the planet’s center (or 3,700 
miles from the surface) and has 
an orbital period of 7 hours and 
39 minutes. The outer moon, 
Deimos, is 14,600 miles from the 
planet’s center and has an orbital 
period of 30 hours and 18 min- 
utes. As can be seen from the fig- 
ures just given, Deimos is some- 
what too slow and a little too far 
away from the planet to have a 
synchronous orbit. A truly syn- 
chronous satellite of Mars would 
have to be 1890 miles closer to 
the planet to match the diurnal 

119 




rotation of Mars, whidi is 24 
hoiirs, 37 minutes and 22J^ sec- 
onds. 

Since the masses of both of 
these moons are negligible there 
will be nd problem in landing; in 
fact a landing on Phobos would 
be more in the nature of a ren- 
dezvous and docking maneuver. 
The object of main scientific in- 
terest is, of course, the surface 
of Alars; but the presence of the 
moons is helpful when it comes 
to communications with earth. A 
number of years ago an expert on 
communications satellites wrote 
an interesting paper which dealt 
with the problem of xiower for 
communications through ^ace. 
Using Mars and earth as an ex- 
ample he arrived at the conclu- 
sion that transmission surface to 
surface would be very costly in 
terms of power. One would do 
much better if the exploring party 
at Lacus so/is on Mars did not 
try for direct contact with Gold- 
stone, California, but sent the 
message to a communications sa- 
tellite orbiting the earth; and the 
earth ground stations would then 
get it from that satellite. 

The Martian moons are just 
right for this purpose, especially 
the slower moving Deimos. 

B efore we discuss the problems 
of interplanetary communica- 
tions we have to have a look at 
Jupiter, which will be in reach of 
120 



improved space vehicles in a few 
years. Being full of mysteries, 
Jupiter is especially attractive to 
astronomers. To begin with we 
don’t know its “true” diameter; 
the figure for the diameter given 
in Table I is the diameter of the 
upper edge of its cloud layer. 
How far it is from that upper 
edge to the surface is not known. 
The atmospheric pressure at the 
surface is not known. The condi- 
tion of the surface is not known — 
and the list of “not-knowns” 
could go on for a rather long 
time. 

Since Jupiter is five times as 
far from the sun as the earth it 
receives only 1/25 as much solar 
radiation, square mile per square 
mile, as the earth does. Witti so 
little heat one should expect a 
frozen planet, surrounded by a 
quiet atmosphere. Well, the plan- 
et may be frozen — although 
there is some doubt even about 
that — but the atmosphere cer- 
tainly is not qvriet. It is in steady 
and erften violent motion, and 
natiiral radio waves coming from 
Jupiter’s atmosphere indicate 
electrical activity. 

A close observation of Jupiter 
over a long pieriod of time from a 
convenient vantage point is like- 
ly to expand our knowledge of 
low-temperature physics enor- 
mously — what is going on in Ju- 
piter’s atmosphere contributes 
quite a number of points to the 
, GALAXY 




list of “not knowns.” Fortanately 
there are vantage points for a 
close observation of Jupiter, for 
the planet has 12 known moons 
and probably an etjual number 
of unknown ones. Most of the 
minor moons (the undiscovered 
ones would all be minor, too} are 
too far from the planet to be 
useful, but the four so-called 
“Galilean satellites,” called that 
after their ffiscoverer, are fairly 
close to the planet (Table II}. 

Inside these four major moons 
there is “No. V” (fifth in the or- 
der of discovery) called Amal- 
thea, at a distartce of only 112,66)0 
miles. It is small, with a dia- 
meter erf less than a hundred 
miles, which would help to make 
a lan^ng easy. It so happens that 
Amalthea also runs in a nearly 
synehronous orbit. The orbital 
period is 12 hours, while the peri- 
od of rotation of Jupiter is 9 
hours and 55 minutes. This means 
that Amalthea will stay over a 
given area of the Jovian atmo- 
sphere for a fairly long time, just 
the situation observers welcome. 

So far things look rather un- 
complicated. Communications 
would be to an artificial satellite 
orbiting Venus, to a moon of 
Mars and to a moon of Jupiter. 
But these communications would 
be interrupted by conjunctions. 
Drawn as a diagram there would 
be a straight line, with Jupiter at 
one end, the earth at the other 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



end and the sun between them. 
To an observer on earth the plan- 
et becomes invisible because it 
disappears in the glare of the sun. 
The actual conjunction, when the 
three bodies form a straight line, 
lasts only for an instant, but the 
period when the planet is too 
close to the sun for observation 
is fairly long. The American 
Ephem&ris for the year 1968 
states that the actual conjunction 
of Jupiter and the sun takes place 
at 7 AM (EST) on September 8, 
1968. Nevertheless the listings of 
the positions of the Jovian moons 
are omitted for the period from 
August 1 to September 25, be- 
cause observations are not feasi- 
ble during this time. 

Assuming that the sun would 
interfere with observations it ap- 
pears that each conjunction of 
Jupiter with the sun would cause 
a communications blackout for 
about six weeks. (I may be un- 
duly pessimistic at this point, but 
the possibility exists so we have 
to think about it.) 

Now Mars and Jupiter only 
offer the problem of single con- 
junctions with the line up: 

Mars — Sun — Earth. 

In the case of Venus we have 
a kind of doubfing of the phe- 
nomenon. The Kne up can be: 

Venus — Sun — Earth' 
which astronomers call a superior 

121 





The positions of Mars and earth as they will 
be in early February 1979. Communications 
ore kept going via on earth equilateral. 
Dotted line Is the irraior axis of the orbit of 
Mors; the Martian aphelion and perihelion 
are marked by the Creek letters a/pha and 
pi- 

conjunction. But there is also the 
inferior conjunction with the line 
up: 

Sun — Venus — Earth. 

Optically Venus disappears in 
both cases. Whether an inferior 
conjunction would interfere with 
communications is something I 
don't know. 

T)ut there is an answer, an an- 
swer that was first presented 
by George O. Smith in a series of 
science-fiction stories: the equi- 
laterals. The idea was based, a 
few times removed, on a 'paper 
written in 1772 by the French 
122 



astronomer Joseph-Louis I.n 
grange, at the time director ol 
Frederick the Great’s Prussi;ui 
Academy of Science in Berlin 
Lagrange tried to solve thr 
“three-body problem,” concern 
ing the positions of three or more' 
bodies in space that mutually acl 
on each other all the time. Ih 
did not solve this problem, but 
he found several positions, five in 
all, where a system of three 
bodies would be stable. 

Only two of these positions 
are of practical interest, the Li 
and Ls points. (Incidentally the 
“L” stands for “liberation” and 
not for Lagrange.) Both lie in the 
orbit of the planet in question 
and both form equilateral tri- 
angles with the sun and with the 
planet. The L 4 point of the earth’s 
orbit is the “leading point,” being 
ahead of llie earth by 60° of arc. 
The Ls point is the “trailing 
point,” being 60° behind. 

Such equilaterals actually exist 
in nature. In the case of Jupiter 
both points are occupied by a 
number of asteroids that some- 
how strayed into Jupiter’s orbit. 
And our moon has very faint dust 
clouds in both these points; here 
the triangle is formed by the dust 
cloud, the moon and the earth. 

How an equilateral station in 
the earth’s orbit would solve a 
communications blackout is 
shown in the diagram. In early 
February 1979 Mars will be in 

GALAXY 




conjunction — and by that time 
there will be people on Mars. 
Mars is then invisible from earth, 
but not invisible to the equilateral 
station. 

The same would apply to Ve- 
nus in superior conjunction. And 
in inferior conjunction, too, if 
this position should prove trou- 
blesome. 

ANY QUESTIONS ? 

'T'his is an answer to several 
-*■ questions, all of which dealt 
with the motions of artificial 
satellites, the meaning of the term 
“geocentric angle” and the prob- 
lem of whether it is possible to 
make a satellite “stand still” in 
orbit. 

To begin with the geocentric 
angle, it simply means that the 
vertex erf the angle coincides with 
the cMiter of the earth. The dia- 
gram ^ows, for example, that a 
satellite in the synchronous orbit 
22,300 miles from the surface will 
move through 90® of arc in six 
hours, with the vertex of that 90® 
angle in the earth’s center. Some 
of the confusion that was clearly 
evident in the letters seems to 
stem from the fact that the dis- 
tances of artificial satellites are 
always given with reference to 
the sxarface of the earth, more 
specifically to the sea level. 
Normally, in astronomy, the dis- 
tances between two bodies are 
FOR YOUR INFORAiATION 



the center-to-center distances; 
since the distances are usually 
very large compared to the size 
of the bodies, there is no notice- 
able difference between center- 
to-center and surface-to-surface 
distances. In the case of the sun 
and the earth the difference is 
less than half a million miles 
which counts for very little when 
compared to the mean distance of 
the earth from the sun, namely 
93 million miles. 

But the difference becomes im- 
portant when a planet and its 
moons are under discussion. The 
surface-to-surface distance of the 
moon and the earth is 5,000 miles 
less than thdr center-to-center 
distance, which averages 239,000 
miles. Just to keep things clearly 





separated, the distances of natoral 
moons are always given center-to- 
center, and the distances of arti- 
ficial satellites surface-tcvsatel- 
Hte. 

As for the satellite that “stands 
still” in spsice, these can fae no 
such thing. A cammunkations 
satellite m the S 3 mchrcHKKis orbit 
over the equator seems to “stmal 
still” only because its motkns in 



its orbit matches the rotation of 
the earth. 

And if you move a spacecraft 
sufficiently far from the earth 
that the earth’s gravitational field 
hardly influences it any more it 
doesn’t "^and stiil” either,, for 
then it will be in oihit around the 
sun, moving at the rate of abcut 
18J4 miles per second.

A couple of years ago o few of us sdence-fiction writers and editors 
were being interviewed by an exceedingly drunken reporter for a national 
weekly magazine. His principal desire appeared to be to reduce each 
writer to a single phrase — “master of space opera," "specialist In satire," 
that sort of thing — and when he came to Mack Reynolds he said, "Ah, 
yes, you're the one who writes the fight scenes," 

Reynolds does that, to be sure. He has written any number of stories 
about future gladlaforfar games, fPie logical outgrowth of today's spectator 
sports, and he has written them very well. But how much more he can do! 
We realized this first when chance put us in the company of a number of 
forward-looking economists, strangers to science fiction, who were entranced 
and excited by Reynolds's brilliant use of such concepts as Basic Income, 
the credit-card phenomenon and all of the other poRfico-socfo-economrc 
gadgets he manipulates so handsomely. 

So we've invited Reynolds to explore some of these Ideas more fuHy 
in Galaxy, and next month we lead off with what strikes os as a first-rate 
example of his special skills. Name is Among the Bad Baboons, and it's a 
longish novelette. 

Damon Knight brings us a further episode in the Ihorion saga« The 
Star Below; Robert Silverberg has the cover story. Going Down Smooth; 
we continue Fritz Leiber's surgical dissection of American folkways In 
A Specfcr Is Haunting Texas ... a good Issue, we think; and we hope youTI 
[oin us next month to see for yourself.

GAEAXY 




Lee Roger Irnstein was not a 
crook. Nor was he honest; he was 
simply a single-minded man who 
never missed any opportunity for 
advancement tljirough such weak- 
nesses as indecision, compassion 
or indifference. 

Lee Roger Irnstein was tall, 
wrinkled, totally gray. His age 
was forty-four. His expression 
was pleasant enough. But his 
eyes never blinked, and once 
their gaze had foimd an oppo- 
nent’s face it never left it, so that 
eventually the opponent was al- 
most glad to yield to defeat and 
sink away out of si^t. Despite 
this characteristic, there was 
nothing that visibly marked Lee 
Roger Irnstein off from the rest 
of his fellow men. The factor that 
did that was hidden in secrecy 
from almost everyone but his cur- 
rent wife, Famagusta Martitia, 
and his downtrodden twelve-year- 
old son, Lee Roger. 

Those two knew that Lee Rog- 
er Irnstein had never taken part 
in a single play-out. 

'^hat vast kingdom over which 
^ Lee Roger Irnstein ruled 
presented a glittering facade to 
the world. Great triumphal arch- 
es, high towers, sky balloons, 
greeted the millions who poured 
into town from all over the world 
for their taste of that shaped 
reality that was so much better, 
so much sweeter, so much more 
126 



vivid than the ordinary reality of 
everyday. 

But at one point, the huge in- 
dustrial complex had broken 
down into a chaos of rubbish. The 
massive functional shapes of play- 
out technology slumped into an 
avalanche of waste. This was at 
Southside, along Gulch Road. 
Here were the extraordinary 
dumps of Ego City, a landscape 
of hills and valleys consisting en- 
tirely of all the expensive cast- 
offs of the city, from the largest 
and glossiest of indestructable 
packing cases down to once-used 
dancing slippers, from saloon 
cars that had been discarded at 
a drunken whim down to unopen- 
ed packs of cigarettes thrown 
away because the cellophane had 
proved a touch resistant, from 
private planes that had suddenly 
ceased to please down to nail- 
clippers that were too blunt to 
clip, from monstrous slabs of 
rusty switdi-gear down to still- 
bright contact lenses. 

In this wilderness lived Bernie 
Burr. 

Except for the fact that he 
never shaved, Bemie Burr looked 
rather like Lee Roger Irnstein. He 
too was tall, wrinkled and totally 
gray. He also was forty-four. His 
expression was pleasant enou^ 
but his gaze — whatever it had 
once done — now never managed 
to meet the gaze of another hu- 
man being. It kept wandering off, 

GAUXY 




as if his eyes were too weak to 
meet the eyesight of anyone else. 
This was very unlike the behav- 
ior of the eyes of Lee Roger Im- 
stein, the man who had defeated 
Bemie Burr. 

Bemie lived with a tattered 
lady of his own age called Barley 
in a battered blue packing case 
that had once housed a Patter- 
son’s Piorgium Model “Dandy.” 
His days were spent scroimging 
through the enchanted detritus of 
the Gulch Road dump, his nights 
telling Barley the story of the 
great days when he owned half 
of Ego City. In consequence, Bar- 
ley ^>ent most of her nights 
drinking and most of her da3rs 
asle^ with her mouth open on 
the seat they had pulled out of 
an old Pullman coach. 

It was a curious thing that 
Bemie Burr ^ould have only 
that one obsessive topic of con- 
versation. A couple of miles away, 
in surroundings as luxurious as 
Bemie’s were dreadful, Roger Lee 
Imstein similarly had only one 
topic of conversation to inflict on 
Famagusta Martitia and Lee 
Roger Junior. It was the same 
topic. 

CCTt was a confrontation,” he 

-*-told them. “A classical con- 
frontation. This Bemie Burr 
wanted to take us over, and we 
wanted to take him over. It seem- 
ed he had all the power, and he 
DREAMER, SCHEMER 



slapped this ultimatum on me. I 
had to accept his corporation’s 
terms by the next morning or 
else. Then he made one false 
move.” 

“I know, he came to see you 
that evening,” Lee Roger Junior 
said. 

“Who’s telling this? Go away 
and play if you can’t keep quiet 1 
As I got home that evening, Bem- 
ie Burr was waiting in the drive. 
He caught hold of my jacket and 
begged me to accept the ultima- 
tum. Said he was having trouble 
with his directors and he would 
be thrown out if this deal didn’t 
go through. I told him he was 
crazy, but he said if I accepted 
the terms of the ultimatum, he’d 
see I was okay. It would solve 
both our troubles, he said. Now 
what makes a man be that 
weak?” 

Famagusta Martitia said, “He 
must have been under a terrible 
strain, honey I” 

“Ker-rist, honey, we all were. 
But why is it that at such a mo- 
ment of truth one man shows 
weak and another strong? I mean, 
it’s all wrapped up in the enigma 
of personality, isn’t it? Anyhow, 
he’d given me his head on a plate. 
Next morning. I rejected the ul- 
timatum, Bernie Burr got the 
push just as he said he would, and 
in the confusion I bought up all 
his backers piecemeal. Ever since 
then, nobody’s ever heard of 

127 




Bemie again and' I’ve been boss 
of Ego City.” 

His wife caressed one of bis 
earlobes;. “You deserve it, honey, 
you’ve been real lucky 1” 

Lee Roger Irastein puiled away 
as if she. bad <tWeaked (ids car. 
“Lucky, honey! Lucky nothing! 
That was tilie mosC unlucky day 
of my life. Ai heart I’m just a 
dreamer, only I octcf get tkne to 
dream, 1 cvuildi Itave been a great 
musiesaBi instead of a captain of 
industry. I’ve been so busy run- 
ning Ego City, I’ve newer had 
time to fulfill my personal des- 
tiny.” 

“Then, honey, why did you 
knock down Bomie Burr like 3 tou 
did?” 

“B&iame Fhi the. nutn I am, 
end I adze chances. I just never 
had a ehantre to be a great musi- 
cian.” 

“Then the man. you are iai’t a 
great muskiaia, hon^.“ 

Lee Roger Irnstein got and 
began to pace up and down. 

“Nobody knows the man L am 
except me, honey.’*’ 

Famagusta Martkia went over 
to the drink mechme and had it 
pour them bothi anodner drink. 
“I don’t: think that you know die 
sort of man you are, hooey. You 
ought to go to a play-out.. You 
know, enter one anonymously. It 
would sort you out tremendously 
and show you exactly tbe sort of 
man you really are.” 

128 



“Now you’re talking nonsense, 
boneyl You know I own those 
things. I don’t have to mdulge in 
them.’* 

“I think you’re seared, honey.” 

And that’s how it happened 
that, a few drinks later, Lee 
Roger Irnstein was persuaded to 
enter one of >bis own play-outs. 

IV jf eanwhite^ back at the oM 
bJoe packing rase, Bemie 
Burr was telling Barley of the 
crisis that had ruined his Me. 

“I played it clever. I drove 
down to this guy Imsteni’s fancy 
mansion and collared him when 
be arrived home. I offered hwn 
a perfectly foolproof deal to get 
these gu 3 TS off my neck who were 
riding me, with a big cut for him. 
Next day, ns two eould have run 
Ego City between us.“ 

“Ah, you couldn’t run a hot 
dog stall!” Barley said. 

“In those days I could. I had 
genius then. But that creep Ira- 
stein loused if all np. He double- 
crossed me next nnoming, and 
from then on I was finished.’* 

Barley hiccupped. “You played 
into his hands, sounds to me. You 
got chicken!” 

“I was meant to be a big boss, 
not a bum! It was just I played 
my hand wrong. All 1 need is an- 
other chance to paove it. Just one 
more chance;” 

“Don’t give me that again! 
Every day I hear the same tune! 

GAEAXY 




Look, Bemie, if you had the same 
dbance again, you'd louse it up 
in tiie same way, see? Because it’s 
your destiny to be a bum!” 

He rose to his feet, clutching 
the bottle as he did so. 

“Don’t you call me a bum, you 
old batl At heart I’m a very re- 
sponsible man, a captain of in- 
dustry, a millionaire, a — ” 

“A bum!’’ Barley finished. 
“You’re kidding yourself! If you 
want to find out the sort of jerk 
you really are, why don’t you go 
into a play-out and see for your- 
self, instead of boring me with 
your load of hogwash?’' 

He poured her another drink. 
“I love you. Barley," he said 
brokenly, “ ’cause you always 
know what’s best for me." 

"VIThat happened when you en- 
’ ^ teied one of the play-out 
theaters was not simple,, but it 
was ^st. Pleasant machines put 
you under li ght hypnosis to re- 
move any surface inhibitions. You 
then stated roughly what your 
problem was, or what sittiation 
you wanted to amuse yourself 
with that evening. These reports 
were flashed to a group of human 
and computer analysts and co- 
ordinated with the reports of 
everyone else entering the play- 
outs at the same time. Pfeople 
wkh similar ends in view were 
grouped together. Cast ^ts were 
formed, and immense script- 
DREAMER, SCHEMER 



writing machines assembled a 
plot to fit the personafities in- 
volved. 

While ■tfiis was going on, and 
it took only a minute, yon were 
being given the drugs that would 
most easily enable you to behave 
as the personality you wished to 
be. Then the plot came on, was 
played to you subliminaKy, and 
the costuming and make-up de- 
partments saw to it that you 
looked the part. By the time that 
was done, you had your role ef- 
fortlessly memorized — though 
there was always room left for 
adlibbing. 

AH over Ego City stood the 
play-out theaters, many of them 
of tremendbus size — the sexual 
theaters being tfie smallest be- 
cause those who wanted that sort 
of play-out needed little action 
in their scripts. After the make- 
up department had finished with 
you,, you would be conveyed by 
tube to tire appropriate theater, 
if you were not already there. 
Many of tire theaters speciaEzed 
in period plays, becaHse it had 
been found that people could ex- 
press their basic needs more free- 
ly when out of their own time. 
No one troubled about historical 
accuracy. It was die sj i ir'it that 
counted. In the theaters were no 
audiences, only participants — 
actors working with other act<»s, 
but each isolated in his or her 
own Kttle ego. 

129 




Tn Theater Fifty-Five, it was a 

blustery spring day in the 
sixth or seventh century. Drama- 
tically lit by the only sunbeam to 
penetrate the doud overhead, 
King Petrovich * stood with his 
arms akimbo, looking south to- 
wards the mountains, while his 
wife, Branka, waited behind him 
at a respectful distance. 

Petrovich was tall, wrinkled, 
totally gray. His age was foity- 
four, his expression was not un- 
pleasant. But as he looked toward 
the valley down which his army 
must p>ass on the morrow, a frown 
creased his forehead. 

Behind him, a temple was be- 
ing built. Behind that stretched 
his army, resting, cooking their 
lean rations. Women and children 
mingled with the men of Petro- 
vich’s army. And beliind them 
were the other followers, the rab- 
ble who had followed his trium- 
phant progress for five years 
across the wildernesses of East- 
ern Emope. 

“You must rest and eat now, 
O my king, in preparation for the 
morrow’s march into Illjnia,” 
Branka said, taking his arm tim- 
idly. 

“Cease, woman! Petrovich can- 
not rest while the fate of his peo- 
ples is at stake.” 

“It is a heavy burden you bear, 
my lord.” 

She was beautiful, tall, pale, 
red of lip, her hair black and skil- 
130 



fully dressed, hanging down to 
her waist. Petrovich seized her 
by the waist and kissed her till 
her mouth was bruised. 

“Aye, the burden of my fate is 
heavy, woman, as you say. There- 
fore I go to pray.” 

Branka fell back as the king 
strode forward into the temple. 
The rude palisade of the temple 
was decorated in a crude manner 
with the figures of soldiers and 
naked maidens. Inside, the roof 
was red and the walls hung with 
tapestries. Although the carpen- 
ters were still at work on the tem- 
ple, their mallet-strokes echoing 
through the interior, the priests 
were already busy, and the smoke 
from a burnt offering drew tears 
in the king’s eyes. 

He prostrated himself before 
his god, a great wooden idol twice 
his size. It had two bodies and 
four heads, all of them fearsome. 
Against one of its massive thighs 
lay its saddle, bridle and mighty 
silver sword, which Petrovidi 
alone of all his people was strong 
enough to wield in battle. 

His prostrations were brief. He 
rose, scattering the priests, and 
strode into the open towards his 
great tent of hide which took 
twenty men to pitch. A scout ran 
up to him, panting, and bowed. 

“Well, varlet?” 

“My lord, the King of the Il- 
lyrians is in the camp. He desires 
word with you.” 



GAIAXY 




"King Donikpus? How comes 
be here?” 

“My lord, he comes in peace 
and even now awaits your gra- 
cious permission to speak with 
you.” 

"Have him brou^t to my 
tent.” 




scattered his serving women. 



"But you must sustain your- 
self, O my Kingl” Branka cried. 

"No time for that — get these 
women from my sighti Bring me 
good Transylvanian wine. Donik- 
pus, King of Illjnia, is here to see 
me.” 

The queen gasped. “But my 
lord, he is your sworn enemy! 
Has he not vowed to slay you to- 
morrow when you march into his 
lands?” 

“There’s villainy afoot. I’ll see 
that I question him closely.” 

“O my King, whispers are 
abroad that your general Yovan 
thinks to spread mutiny among 
your subjects.” 

Petrovich stroked his great iron 
gray beard and raised an eye- 
brow. “I have no time to waste on 
the sub-plot now, woman. Stick 
to the main scripts. Where’s the 
wine?” 

A great oxhom bound in silver 
and splashing over with the dark 
red liquor of Transylvania was 
brought to him. As he quaffed it 
DREAMER, SCHEMER 



back, trumpets soimded without 
and General Yovan entered with 
the King of the Illyrians and at- 
tendant lords, etc. 

Donikpus and Petrovich stared 
each other in the eye. Donikpus, 
for all his outlandish garb and 
armor that aped the Roman, was 
not unlike his rival though he 
wore no beard. He was tall, 
wrinkled and would probably 
have been fair were he not totally 
gray. He was forty-four years of 
age; his expression would have 
been pleasant were he not scowl- 
ing now. Branka thrust an oxhom 
of wine into his hand, and the 
tension in the tent somewhat re- 
laxed. 

“You realize your head is in 
jeopardy every moment you re- 
main in my camp?” Petrovidi 
said. 

“You do not imagine I enter 
this pagan place for pleasure?” 

“State your business and be 
gone!” 

“Mind I do not go without 
stating it! Or your corpse, Petro- 
vich, will lie reeking in the dust 
by tomorrow’s sunset.” 

“You dare to threaten me, 
Donikpus? I’ll ride into battle 
with your body rolling behind my 
horse!” 

“I’ll have you driven back to 
the wilds from which you camel” 

"I’n have your entrails strewni 
through every field between here 
and Kief!” 

131 




General Yovan eoughed. “My 
lords, the scr^t, I pray I Should 
not the King of the Illyrians state 
his business?" 

“You’re r>ght,” Donikpus said, 
quaffing his wine. “Petrovidi, we 
are both in mortal danger. I come 
to offer an ahiance.’’ 

“An alhance with you!” boom- 
ed Petrovich. “What means tius?” 
“Ride with me two leagues to 
the hills, and I will riiow you 
proof of the danger. Unless you 
ore afraid . ” 

Petrovich looked about him, at 
Itte anxious face of his wife, the 
stolid face of Yovan, the stem 
faces of the attendant lords, etc. 
He took another great drag at his 
wine. “I’ll ride with you,” he said. 
As his wife ran with him weeping 
to his horse he said to her, “And 
keep an eagle eye on the dastard- 
ly designs of General Yovan.” 
“Sure, hooey,” rfie said. “So 
will I, by my troth.” 

iT^ntirely unaccwnpanied, the 
two kings rode together out 
of camp. It was sunset now, and 
all tlie western sky was a ragged 
mass of red and gold cloud. The 
ground beneath them was dark 
as tbey spurred their steeds up 
the side of the hill. 

At last they reined at the sum- 
mit. The camp lay behind, fires 
twinlding here and there, an oc- 
oasioaal burst of hoarse song ris- 
ing even to this eminence. South 
132 



lay the mountains and the somber 
valley of the Siva River. 

“That way you and your host 
must go tomorrow,” Donikpus 
said, ptointing down the valley. 
“You will be wiped out from be- 
hind. You see that old stone Mith- 
raic temple over there, at the be- 
ginning of the valley?” 

“It is deserted. My scouts ex- 
amined it thoroughly this after- 
noon.” 

“Empty it is, Petrovich. But 
rinder it are great caves. All this 
barren mountain is a maze of 
caves. Those caves are filled with 
half the Illyrian host. When you 
have passed, they will burst out 
and attack you from the rear, 
white the other half will attack 
from the front. You will be 
slaughtered to a man.” 

Petrovich turned his scowling 
regard to the other, searching 
that wrinkled face lit by the light 
of the dying sun. 

“You are the Ill3rrian king, yet 
you teU me this! How so?” 

And Donikpus explained. He 
was in trouble, particularly with 
his iq>start son. Prince GcMgues, 
who would lead' the amburii. Do- 
nikpus wanted to do a deal with 
Petro'vich. He would fix things so 
that they would have an alliance 
together, and in the morning, 
they could unite forces and wipe 
out Gorgues. “We can probably 
mop up your General Yovan 
too,” he suggested. 



GALAXY 




Silence fell, and a moon rose in 
the sky while Petrovich consider- 
ed these things. A night bird was 
Binging. At last Petrovich spoke. 

“You have delivered your 
whole nation into my hands,” he 
said. “I shall be prepared for the 
ambush tomorrow, I shall capture 
Gorgues and tell him of your de- 
ceit, and he wiU wipe you out. I 
can then wipe him out in my own 
good time. You have no courage, 
and so you are defeated before 
you start! This is the moment of 
truth, Donikpus, is it not?” 

The Illyrian king’s teeth flash- 
ed in a sneer. “You opportunist, 
Petrovich! Uneasy lies the head 
that wears the crown, I say! 
Those that live by the sword shall 
die by the sword! Farewell, false 
king! I’ll match you yet!” 

Setting spur to his palfrey, he 
galloped down the long slopes 
towards the forbidding valley 
that marked the marches of his 
kingdom, leaving Petrovich to sit 
and brood on the hill. 

A torrent of confused emotion 
ran through Petrovich. He recall- 
ed all he had said to Branka — 
and all he had not said; he re- 
called all he had ever done — 
and all he had not done; he re- 
called all he hoped to be — and 
all he hoped not to be. 

The sky was free of cloud now. 
All the stars shone down, and a 
comet or two appeared. 

Suddenly, Petrovich spurred 
DREAMER, SCHEMER 



his horse and galloped down into 
the valley along the path that the 
Illyrian king had taken. He had 
come to a decision. 

To his surprise, he saw that 
E>onikpus had stopped, turned 
about and was riding backw Both 
men, alarmed by the other’s 
change of plans, drew swords. 
They charged towards each other 
at a gallop and met by the rush- 
ing Siva River with a clash of 
metal. 

“Halt, then!” cried Donikpus. 
“It’s too late to change your 
mind, you braggart king! I want 
my crown no more. I’m a dreamer 
at heart, not a ruler. I’m off into 
the mountains among the simple 
people. I shall grow a beard and 
become a wandering musician, 
singing the ballads of my people.” 
“You can’t do that!” Petrovich 
exclaimed. “I’m tired of kingship, 
too. Besides, I have a better voice 
than you!” 

“You lie! My voice is the finest 
in all the coastlands of Illyria |” 
“Pah, that pipsqueak voicel 
Donikpus, you couldn”t keep a 
baby awake with your singing, 
and you must die — ” 

But even as he lunged forward 
with his silver sword, the king of 
Illyria limged forward with his 
gold one. For a moment, tlie light 
of the comets flashed along their 
deadly blades. Both men grunted 
almost in unison. Silence fell. 
Then, very slowly, one king top- 

133 




of I his horse towards the left 
•timip aad Ae oAer towards Ae 
right stirrup. Since Aey were fac- 
ing each oAer, Aey fell on top of 
each oAer an^ roBed togeAer m- 
to Ae rapid stream, where Ae 
wavelets, chiB from the heists of 
Ae mounAin, washed over Aeir 
idghtless eyes. 

All this time, Gorgues was car- 
eusing in a stunulating faAion in- 
side Ae limestone mountain, 
while exciting Aings were hap- 
pening to General Yovan in the 
i^een’s tent .... 

I3recauti(ms were taken so Aat 
participants in play-outs, 
when learving Ae Aeaters after 
Aeir roles were done, did not 
haeet any fellDw actors. But since 
Aese precautions had been ar- 
ranged by Bemie Burr in Ae 
days when he owned half of Ego 
City, he had small trouble in 
circumventing Aem. 

S« when Lee Rogers Irhstein 
icame to cKmb into his self-driven 
Hknausine, he found a ragged fig- 
ure waiting for him in Ae shad- 
ows. 

“Lee?” Bemie asked huskily. 
'•Say, Lee, I recognized you in 

tfierel” 

WiAout Ainking, Lee Rogers 
Imstein clutched Bemie’s hand. 
*Bemiel I recognized you — after 
all Aese yearsi” 

“Several cen Aries, hasn’t it 
keen?” Bemie said dryly. 

134 



“Say, I really learnt somethini* 
about myself in Aere,” Lee 
Rogers Imstein said. “Should 
have gone long ago, like Fama- 
gusta said.” 

“You made a swell Illyrian 
king,” Bemie said. “And you 
know what I learnt about my- 
self? That I am really happier as 
I am Aan as a king or a capAin 
of industry or in any post with 
responsibility. I could have dou- 
ble-crossed you, but at Ae last 
moment I ratted out!” 

They both lit Imstein cigars, 
and Aat magnate said, emotion 
in his voice, “You were a great 
warrior king, Bemie. I kind of 
admired Aat beard of yours. And 
I liked your Branka, too. Showed 
good taste.” 

He was in an uncharacteristi- 
cally sentimental mood. His 
death as Donikpus — stabbed by 
a prop sword made of a wonderful 
alloy that disnitegrated immedi- 
ately on touching human flesK — 
had momentarily softened him. 
Gazing at Bemie, he said, “Know 
what I learnt about myseK? I’m 
just not destined to be a wander- 
ing minstrel or a great musician 
or any of Aat stuff. I may think 
I want to be, but Aat way spells 
deaA for me. In Ae Ature, I 
shall be content wiA Ae humbler 
role of king of the Illyrians. I 
mean, of course, of Ego City.” 

A long silence fell, while they 
leaned against Ae car.

* We really got ourselves sorted 
out in there,” Bemie said. “Won- 
derful form of entertainment we 
invented between us.” 

“Say, Bemie, I’m not just say- 
ing this, but it really has been 
swell meeting you again. Like the 
good old dajrs.” 

Bemie nodded. Looking cau- 



tiously about to see that nobody 
could overhear them, he said, 
“Look, Lee, why don’t I come 
and see you in the morning? I’ve 
got a little proposition to put to 
you that could make all the dif- 
ference to both of us .... ”

I 

IV /T ervyn Grey, nicknamed the 
Boy Wonder of the Busi- 
ness World, had not become a 
millionaire at twenty-nine through 
indecisiveness. 

Accordingly, when he found an 
overnight memo sent by teleprint- 
er from Edgar Casson, his Lon- 



don deputy, which said Casson 
counted himself fortunate to have 
obtained three shillings a share 
for holdings in a company that 
yesterday had been quoted at 
nine shillings and sixpence, he 
left the Grand Bahama head- 
quarters of his financial empire 
on the next VC-10. 

He hadn’t bothered to send 



137 



ahead and say he was coming, 
but the stolid, heavy-set broker 
was not surprised when a chauf- 
feur-driven Rolls arrived before 
his expensive home that evening. 
He told his wife to entertain the 
dinner guests on her own, to keep 
his food warm for later and not to 
interrupt him on any account, 
and he himself welcomed Grey in 
the library. 

Short, blond, tense to the point 
of feverishness, always seeming — 
even when sitting behind tiis desk 
— to be on the point of heading 
elsewhere at a dead run. Grey 
dropped into the most comfort- 
able chair, took the fuller of the 
two glasses of sherry which Cas- 
son poured and demanded, “WHat 
in hell’s name happened to Lup- 
ton & White?” 

Casson had been anticipating 
this; but, as usual, having the 
width of the Atlantic between 
them had given Kim an exagger- 
ated impression of His ability to 
deal calmly witfi Grey in a bad 
temper. He licked his lips ner- 
vously and said in a defensive 
tone, “It’s still happening, you 
know. They went through one 
and sixpence by close df t^iness 
this afternoon, and tomorrow you 
won’t be able to give them away. 
Under the circumstances — ” 

"What happen^?” Grey said. 
“And give me another glass of 
that muck you were conned into 
buying as sherry.”

Casson complied with a sigh. 
Much of the day he had been 
mentally rehearsing the explana- 
tions he was going to give if Grey 
turned up, and with considerable 
polishing he felt he had prepared 
a rather impressive story: the ini- 
tial astonishment, the quick re- 
action which shaved their losses, 
the discreet pumping of knowl- 
edgeable acquaintances, the even- 
tual remarkable discovery . 

But the hell with it. If he pre- 
varicated, Grey would quite like- 
ly fire him. He set down the new- 
ly filled glass and reached into 
the inner pocket of his impeccable 
dinner jacket. 

happened to them,” fie 
said baldly, and tfirust a 
sheet of paper, folded twice, into 
Gre3r’s outstretched fiand. 

Factsheet Five” Grey read 
aloud from tfie Beading. “Wfiat 
does this have to do witfi it?” 
“Read the whole thing,” Cas- 
son shrugged. “Then you’ll know 
as much as I do, or anyone else 
that I’ve spoken to.” 

Grey scowled, but did as fie 
was told. What he had been giv- 
en was a sort of leaflet, produced 
by photo-offset from a typed ori- 
ginal — a badly-typed original, 
moreover, with irregular margins, 
many errors and even two or three 
lines which Had been crudely x’ed 
out. The heading was in bold 
black Letraset capitals, but even 

GAIAXY 




ttiat was a sloppy job; and the 
capital “F” of “Five” was creas- 
ed at tiie top. 

Altogether there were about ten 
or a dozen short paragraphs, each 
prefaced with' the name of a com- 
pany, of which he recognized the 
majority. With growing anger and 
bewilderment, he read through 
them. 

Dale, Dockery & Petronelli Ltd. 
Ice-cream and ice-lolly manulac- 
turers. During the last six months 
3,021 children who had bought 
their products contracted stomach 
disorders. 

Grand International Tobacco 
Corp. “Prestige," “Chilimenth" 
and “Cachet” cigarettes. 14,186 of 
the cases of lung cancer diagnosed 
last year occurred among users of 
these brands. 

Scientifically Tested Protec- 
tives Ltd. Surgical rubber goods. 
20,512 unwanted pregnancies oc- 
curred last year in cases where 
the parents had relied exclusively 
on this firm’s products. 

And there was the one he’d 
been looking for: Lupton fis White 
Ltd. Catering equipment. 1,227 
employees of firms using bread- 
slicers, bacon-slicers and other 
cutting devices applied by this 
company lost one or more fingers 
in the period under review. 

Grey winced and shuddered at 
the momentary image of a hand 
spouting blood across the clean 
white enamel of a bacon-slicer,

but he had a twenty-thousand- 
pound loss on his mind. He look- 
ed up at Casson, who had taken 
a chair facing him and was 
gloomily piercing a cigar for him- 
self. 

“This — this rag did for Lup- 
ton 6s White?” 

“So I’ve been told,” Casson 
agreed. 

“But — but for heaven’s sake!” 
Grey counted rapidly on both 
sides of the paper. “There are 
eleven named companies here. 
Did an 3 Tthing happen to the oth- 
ers? How about Grand Interna- 
tional Tobacco?” 

“They latmched a new promo- 
tion scheme two weeks ago v^ch 
has already visibly increased tiieir 
sales. It started an upward trend 
in their price, too. But, for what- 
ever reason the trend leveled off 
yesterday, and today they slipped 
back threepence. I agree, that 
isn’t evidence. But the coinci- 
dence is indicative.” 

“Oh, for the Lord’s sake! That 
happens all the time, that kind 
of thing; but a nosedive like Lup- 
ton 8s White’s is practically un- 
precedented! How can you argue 
that a slovenly scrap of paper 
like this is responsible? And in 
any case, why diis firm in partic- 
ular, with twelve hundred alleged 
victims, and not the contracep- 
tive makers with twenty thou- 
sand?” 

“Because there’s no way of get- 

139 




ting back at the firm which land- 
ed you with an unwanted baby. 
But there is a new and very much 
stiffer Industr^l Compensation 
Bill before Parliament at the mo- 
ment, which makes the manufac- 
turer as well as the operator of 
industrial equipment liable if the 
employee gets hurt. If the per- 
formance of last year is repeated 
next, Lupton & White could be 
hit for an estimated three hun- 
dred thousand in claims, which 
would wipe out their gross profit 
— phfftl” 

“Re-tooling to cure the prob- 
lem, make the machines safer?” 
Grey snapped his fingers. “No, 
don’t bother to answer. They re- 
styled their entire line three years 
ago, didn’t they?” 

“And still haven’t paid off more 
than sixty per cent of the loan 
they obtained to finance the job.” 
Casson gave the words an air of 
finality. “No, confidence in Lup- 
ton & White is nil, and what they 
can look forward to is bankrupt- 
cy. Which is, I suppose, a kind 
of poetic justice — assuming they 
really did cost all these people 
their fingers, or their hands.” 

“Nonsense!” Grey exclaimed. 
“Any idiot should know that a 
sharp cutting instrument is dan- 
gerous! So’s a pocket-knife — so’s 
a razor-blade, come to that!” 

^asson’s mouth twisted as 
though he were amused de- 
140 



spite his depression. "The person 
who puts out that Factsfieet is 
fully aware of that,” he said. 
“You haven’t read the other side, 
have you? Look at — I think it’s 
the last item but one.” 

Grey turned the paper over. He 
read aloud, “New Dawn razor- 
blades were used in 23 of the 28 
face-slashing cases known to the 
police in — ” And, breaking off, 
abruptly, he stared at Casson. 

“How in the world could any- 
one take this rubbish seriously? 
There must be a lunatic behind 
it!” 

“Someone took it seriously. A 
lot of people, in fact. The proof 
is in what happened to Lupton 
8e White, isn’t it?” 

“No, of course that isn’t proof!” 
Grey jumped up and began to 
pace the room. “What about all 
these other companies? I didn’t 
see a simultaneous crash by all 
of them.” 

Three of them aren’t public 
companies, so they can be disre- 
garded. And the rest are all sub- 
sidiaries of much larger combines, 
which can cushion the blow.” 
“But — !” Grey slammed fist 
into palm furiously, and the Fact- 
sheet floated to the floor. Casson 
bent and recovered it. 

“But what, Mr. Grey?” 

“But granting that you’re right, 
something ought to be done about 
it! Isn’t this — weU — libel, or 
something?” 



GALAXY 




“Apparently not. You can’t li- 
bel a corporation, only an individ- 
ual.” 

“But it’s sucK transparent non- 
sense!” Grey tKunder^. “WKo in 
Heaven’s name could track down 
— oH, for example, tfie parents of 
all tKese unwanted babies? It’s 
absurd!” 

“Absurd or not, I tell you it is 
taken very seriously by a lot of 
people. Shall I explain?” 

“Yes, go ahead,” Grey said 
wearily, and slumped back into 
his chair. 

“It took me a lot of probing to 
get Hold of that issue of the Fact- 
sheet,” Casson said. “I called — 
well, a long-time friend of mine, 
let’s say — while I was trying to 
find out wHat Had Happened to 
Lupton’s, and He said if he’d only 
realized I had a Holding in tHe 
firm He’d have tipped me off. I 
asked How he knew, and He said 
he’d tell me if I Had lunch witfi 
him. I did, and that was wKen He 
showed me that paper. He told 
me He had a photostat so I was 
welcome to have it. 

“He said He doesn’t know any- 
one else who receives it. He Has 
no idea wKy he receives it or wHo 
sends it to him. It just arrives, 
roughly once a month, in a plain 
envelope and always witK a dif- 
ferent postmark. He’s been get- 
ting it since issue number tKree, 
wlucH He thought was a crank’s 
ravings and threw away. How- 
FACTSHEET SIX 



ever, one item did stick in his 
memory because it referred to a 
canned-meat company he was 
interested in, and implied that 
they were lax in their hygiene. 
So, superstitiously — to quote 
his own term — he revised his in- 
tention of buying in. A few days 
later an outbreak of typhoid in 
Leeds was traced to a caimed 
corned beef shipped by that very 
firm. Naturally, tHe bottom drop- 
ped out of their sales for three 
months until the impact of the 
news faded.” 

“Go on,” Grey said, listening 
intently. 

“Well, next time he received a 
Factsh'eet, of course, he read it 
very carefully. He Had no Hold- 
ings in any of the firms it listed, 
but he kept an eye on them out 
of curiosity. One, of the entries 
was similar to this one Here, 
about the ice-cream, and said a 
lot of children Had fallen ill after 
buying toys imported by Kid Dee 
Fun. You know them?” 

“Of course. Dolls and novel- 
ties from Hong Kong and Japan. 
And they were the firm that ran 
foul of Constuners’ Association.” 

“Correct,” Casson nodded. 
“There proved to be an arsenical 
compound in the paint used on 
some of their dolls, and they Had 
to call in ten thousand poimds’ 
worth and bum them.” 

“WHo the Hell was it wKo told 
you all this?” Grey demanded. 

141 




“He asked me not to give his 
name to anyone,” Casson mur- 
mured. “But — well, I checked 
on some of the companies Ke ad- 
mitted having stock in when I’d 
left him after lunch, and I can 
safely estimate that he’s worth 
half a million, so he must be com- 
petent and have good judgment. 
Which I already believed, of 
course. I’m far too cynical to be- 
lieve a yam like this without, as 
it were, verifsnng the teller’s cre- 
dentials.” 

/^rey looked at him for a long 
moment. He said finally, 
“Has he ever gone for any of the 
very big companies?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Let me see that leaflet again!” 
Grey snatched at it and pondered 
in silence for long moments. At 
length he said, “I have to give 
the guy credit. He’s smart, isn’t 
he?” 

“How do you mean?” Casson 
countered. 

"OH, come off it!” Grey snort- 
ed. “It’d be obvious if you could 
see beyond the end of your nose! 
This is a brilliant con job, put 
out by one of the cleverest mar- 
ket-manipulators I ever heard of. 
There’s a pattern here which gives 
him away. You honestly don’t 
see it?” 

The nervousness which Casson 
thought he had escaped by con- 
vincing Grey of the truth of his 
142 



assertions returned in full force. 
Feebly he shook his head. 

“In that case you’re more gulli- 
ble than I imagined,” Grey snap- 
ped. “Maybe I should think 
about handing my affairs over to 
someone who isn’t going soft in 
the head with premature senility! 
Goddamn it, man, think! From 
what you’ve told me all these 
sheets follow a similar pattern. 
Each includes a kernel of hard 
fact — the infected meat, the 
arsenical paint — which could be 
established by anybody with ac- 
cess to the right channels of in- 
formation. I’m willing to bet I 
could compile a list of twenty 
damaging facts off the top of my 
head which I could use against 
as many different companies with 
household brand-names! Then I 
could invent lots more, dressed 
up with statistics, which could 
neither be verified nor disproved 
but which would take color from 
their surroundings. And I’ll bet 
that’s what he’s doing, whoever he 
is. And then I could salt the 
whole lot with an item about a 
company which is peculiarly vul- 
nerable, like Lupton & White. Re- 
sult: the ultimate in inside mar- 
ket information, the self-fulfilling 
prophecy.” 

Casson said, “Yes, but — ” 

“But what?” Grey waited an 
instant, then added, “Oh, come 
on, come on! What’s your opin- 
ion of the man who puts this col- 

GALAXY 




lection of nonsense together?” 

“Well — ” 

“A public benefactor, drawing 
attention to products which make 
people ill, chop their fingers off, 
kill them in accidents? In that 
case why doesn’t he attack big 
companies with a staff who could 
follow up his charges? Directly or 
indirectly I control a labor force 
of sixty thousand, don’t I? I 
could hire a hundred more and 
set them to work tomorrow if I 
had to, checking out the claim 
that umpty-dozen cars riding on 
Ultrac Tires were involved in ac- 
cidents last month, or however 
many housewives were drowned 
in Miracle Whirl washing-ma- 
chines.” 

“And would you?” Casson said. 

“Would I what?” 

“Would you hire the people to 
check the claims? When the car- 
testers reported that Ultracs skid- 
ded more easily and were more 
likely to come away from the rim 
of the wheel when cornering at 
speed — ” 

“I did sweet Fanny Adams 
about it. Correct. How in hell 
could I? Any tire will misbehave 
if you treat it badly enough! And 
things went on exactly as before, 
didn’t they? Ultracs sell well be- 
cause they’re cheap and well ad- 
vertised. All this consumer-test- 
ing nonsense affects maybe a hun- 
dred thousand buyers in this 
whole country, and there are mil- 
FACTSHEET SIX 



lions over and beyond those few 
who want what I’m giving them. 
These are hard commercial facts, 
Casson. I didn’t invent the mar- 
ket, and no more can I be held 
responsible for the people it con- 
sists of. You haven’t answered 
my question: did you honestly 
picture the publisher of this Fact- 
sheet as a knight in shining ar- 
mor, crusading against dangerous 
consumer goods? No, you 
couldn’t be that naive.” 

H ideously embarrassed, Casson 
felt himself begin to flush 
under the lashing scorn of Grey's 
tongue. Not for the first time he 
wondered how much longer he 
could stand working for this — 
this youth. He himself was over 
fifty, almost twice Grey’s age, ex- 
perienced, successful, highly re- 
garded in his own field. Yet there 
was something about Grey which 
could make him cringe, want to 
curl up inside himself and go a 
long way away very quickly. Per- 
haps it was what the admiring 
gossip columnists had no qualms 
about terming ruthlessness; per- 
haps it was just that his un- 
ashamed greed made him acutely 
sensitive to the greed of the peo- 
ple who bought the products he 
offered. It had begun with house- 
hold durables, and the discovery 
that people resented having to 
pay so much for the equipment to 
perform unglamorous chores like 

143 




doing the laundry, yet felt forced 
to acquire tugU-priced, HigH-pre- 
cision equipment for them be- 
cause that act itself loaned tKe 
work a Smidgin‘S of glamour. 

That led to knocked-down 
washing machines, assembled in 
half an hour with a screwdriver 
— supplied. The result was hand- 
some; he hired good designers to 
package his products. From there 
he went on to other expensive 
items for the home, likewise in 
kit form, and thence to the car, 
the next highest investment in the 
family budget. First there were 
things to make a routine vehicle 
look like a custom-built modifica- 
tion, and then there was the ma- 
jor breakthrough into the tire 
business, following the discovery 
that drivers resented having to 
pay so much for equipment no 
one but experts would notice and 
comment on and would rather fit 
a sun-visor and a windtone horn 
than a new set of high-perform- 
ance tires. 

And so on, in a fantastic p3n'a- 
mid. There had been nothing like 
it since John Bloom’s meteoric 
rise, and unlike his predecessor 
Mervyn Grey showed no sign of 
over-reaching himself. Even the 
loss on Lupton & White would be 
absorbed by a holding company 
worth ten times as much. 

What next? 

He grew aware that Grey was 
staring at him sardonically and 

144 



fished back in memory for the 
echo of the last thing that had 
been said to him. 

“Well — ah, no! I don’t sup- 
pose I did picture whoever is re- 
sponsible for the Factsheet as a 
‘crusader.’ ’’ Recovering rapidly 
from his moment of dismay, Ee 
ploughed on. “On the other Hand, 
he must have a bee in his bonnet, 
don’t you think? Perhaps he suf- 
fers from misplaced idealism.” 
Grey considered the suggestion, 
his expression becoming more cor- 
dial. “I think not, though it’s a 
rational possibility. A monoman- 
iac obsessed with things like safe- 
ty, the health of children and so 
on would be more likely to let fly 
wildly at the big corporations, as 
I said before. No, this has all the 
earmarks of a cunning, thorough- 
ly planned campaign. So let’s 
take advantage of it.” 

He leaned back in his chair 
and put his fingertips together. “I 
want you to do two things. First, 
buy Lupton & White.” 

“What? But I told you — 
they’re headed for bankruptcy!” 
“Blockhead! I don’t mean take 
them over direct! I mean sweep 
up a good fat majority holding. 
A^o financed their restyling the 
other year — one of the merchant 
banks, was it? Well, it doesn’t 
matter. Whoever did it won’t 
want the company to go bust. 
They’ll become the effective con- 
trollers of what assets survive, 

GALAXY 




and if the property won’t cover 
their outlay they’ll listen to a 
scheme for recovery, won’t they? 
This Industrial Compensation Bill 
won’t become law next week, for 
heaven’s sake! We can dump any 
stocks of dangerous products — 
export ’em at cost, if we Have to. 
There’s bound to be some ignor- 
ant nignog somewhere who’d like 
to pretty up his jungle grocery 
store with a nice new slicing ma- 
chine ! Hell, why should I have to 
spell out the details to you of all 
people? A change of title and the 
magic of the name ‘Mervyn Grey,’ 
and we can have the firm back 
where it was inside a couple of 
years. All what’s wrong is that 
you panicked and dumped our 
holdings, so now we’re going to 
have to buy it back, aren’t we?” 

Casson said, “But when it start- 
ed to slide so fast — ” 

“You stuck to rigid principles 
instead of using a bit of imagina- 
tion. Ah, never mind. With luck 
we’ll come out in one piece after 
all. But you’re going to have to 
make up for it, you know, Cassie- 
boy!” 

“Don’t call me that!” Casson 
snapped. 

“Why not?” Grey’s tone was a 
savage caress. “When you behave 
like somebody years my junior, 
can I help thinking of you as an 
inexperienced teen-ager? Shut up, 
an3Tway — I don’t want to spend 
longer than I can help in this 
FACTSHEET SIX 



chilly damp country. The other 
thing you’re going to have to do 
to make up for your mistake is 
find me the person who publishes 
that.” He stabbed his finger 
through the air towards the Fact- 
sheet. “He’s got something going 
for him. I’d like to have it going 
for me. Never let it be said that 
I can’t recognize an original idea, 
especially when it pays this kind 
of conspicuous dividends.” 

He rose and headed for the 
door. “You’ve got until the next 
issue comes out, Cassie-boy,” he 
threw over His shoulder. “Other- 
wise you’re through. ’Byel” 

II 

/^he more Grey thought about 
it, the more He was impressed 
with the brilliant simplicity of the 
Factsheet idea. If, in the space of 
a few short months, the man be- 
hind it had built up such a fund 
of confidence as to take in Cas- 
son — who, for all Grey’s gibes, 
was extremely competent — and 
Casson’s anonymous friend and at 
least several score other people 
with substantial holdings in Lup- 
ton & White, since otherwise the 
price-slide would not have been 
so swift or so complete, then he 
had a remarkable gift for exploit- 
ing gullibility. It was Grey’s life- 
time conviction that the mass of 
the world’s population were idiots. 
Finding someone else who Had ar- 

145 




rived at tiie same conclusion and 
benefited from His insiglit was 
enough' to make Him decide tKat 
that person was going to be use- 
ful. i 

Day by day Uttle snippets of 
information arrived across tKe 
ocean from London wEicH ena- 
bled Him to roimd out Es picture 
of the m3rsterious market manipu- 
lator. He began to tffinir of Him as 
a financial counterpart of a g3^psy 
fortune teller, not merely because 
he used tHe standard technique of 
slipping in tiie crucial item among 
a fog of carefully cGosen irrele- 
vancies to give tKe whole a pKo- 
ney air of precision by employing 
those incredible statistics, but also 
because of tHe ingenious misdirec- 
tion He Had adopted from tKe 
start wKen presenting His monthly 
bulletins. 

If Ke Had issued something slick 
and professional, people would at 
once Have associated Kim witK tKe

Watching tKe course of tKe

GALAXY 




tfie gradual decline of Grand In- 
ternational Tobacco over the next 
couple of weeks, in the reversion 
of a former slow rise in another 
company, in the sudden cancella- 
tion of a takeover bid for yet a 
third. 

O n the spur of the moment lie 
called Casson direct and 
learned little enough for his pains. 
The envelopes in which the Fact- 
sheets arrived were the largest- 
selling brand in the country; the 
paper they were printed on was 
made by the largest mills; the 
typewriter was a discontinued 
model and could be one of sever- 
al thousand still in use. Listening 
to the flow of excuses, he grew 
suddenly angry. 

“You have one more week!” he 
rapped. “If I’m not on the mailing 
list for Factsheet Six, I’ve finished 
with you — is that clear?’’ 

There was a moment of silence. 
At length Casson cleared his 
throat. 

“Well, there is one thing it oc- 
curred to me you could do,” he 
said. “I hesitated to suggest it, 
but . .” 

“What is it?” 

“You could advertise, perhaps? 
Say in the Financier Times? I’m 
certain the — ah — the publisher 
must read the financial press very 
closely,” 

Grey was on the point of de- 
claring that it was a ridiculous 
FACTSHEET SIX 



idea, when he checked the words 
and reconsidered. In sober fact 
the points Casson had mentioned, 
like the commonness of the ma- 
terials used to prepare the Fact- 
sheets, did imply that it would 
be hard to breach the wall of 
anonymity surrounding the pub- 
lisher. And 'he did want to find 
that man. He wanted it so much 
it was becoming an obsession. He 
kept finding himself daydream- 
ing of the ways in which he could 
exploit the reputation the Fact- 
sheets now enjoyed to drag down 
the price of companies and let 
him buy into them, reorganize 
them and put them back on the 
market under new names spon- 
sored by what he referred to as 
his “magic.” 

But he was too impatient mere- 
ly to copy the idea and start his 
own monthly bulletin along simi- 
lar lines. He wanted the fund of 
goodwill — or rather, gullibility 
— the existing version Had estab- 
lished. Hence he wanted the mail- 
ing-list. 

Casson said, “I thought we 
should put a few anonjmious ad- 
vertisements in other places, too, 
like — ” 

“Anon3mious?” Grey cut in. 
“Hell, no I Are you determined to 
undermine the good impression 
made by your occasional fits of 
insight? Why anonymous? If it’s 
known that Mervyn Grey is in- 
terested in the Factsheet, this is 

,147 




going to give the guy the kind of 
cachet he’s after, isn’t it? It’ll 
probably drive the last of the 
skeptics into hi? net. He’d love 
me for that! Yes, go ahead and 
place those ads at once!” 

Ill 

Qix days later the morning mail 
^ included a note typed on Half 
a sheet of plain white paper, in an 
ordinary airmail envelope ad- 
dressed to “Mr. Mervyn Grey, 
Mervyn Grey Enterprises, Grand 
Bahama Island.” It ran, curtly 
enough: 

I understand you are interested 
in the forthcoming issue of my 
Factsheet. Well you miifit be. I 
shaU be pleased to show you a 
copy personally. If you call, how- 
ever, do so by yourself. 

At the top there was an address, 
in a small town several miles 
north of London. At the bottpm 
there was a name — George Han- 
dling. And not only was the type- 
face the same as that of the Fact- 
sheet, but so was the clumsy use 
of the machine, with a good half- 
dozen errors in the few lines of the 
note. 

Jubilantly Grey told his secre- 
tary to get him on a flight to Eng- 
land as soon as possible. He was 
about to instruct her to put a call 
in to Casson as well, when he 
changed his mind. Even though 
tlie man’s idea of advertising for 
148 



the Factsheet’s publisher had paid 
dividends, it had taken an uncon- 
scionable time. Casson, he decid- 
ed, was due to be discarded in 
favor of somebody younger and 
more enterpriang, and it would 
be better to provoke him into re- 
signing than to dismiss him open- 
ly. Best of all, of course, would be 
“retirement” — not to salve Cas- 
son’s feelings, because he regarded 
people who couldn’t protect them- 
selves as a liability and would not 
go out of his way to help them, 
but simply because it would do 
an inescapable minimum of dam- 
age to the image of lus financial 
empire if the outside world were 
allowed to detect an internal dis- 
agreement. 

So let it work this way, he de- 
cided: he would go to England 
without telling anyone he was 
coming; he would make his way 
to the home, or office, or what- 
ever it was, of this Mr. Handling, 
and he would make him a propo- 
sition — a very good one. He 
might even offer him Casson’s 
post, in due time, if his Other tal- 
ents matched his skill in exploit- 
ing credulity. It was going to take 
a person of unusual ingenuity to 
make the most of the new vistas 
that control over the Factsheet 
was opening up. 

There had to be lavish tips, of 
course: to the airline’s staff, to 
ensure no one mentioned his ar- 
rival to the gossip columnists — 

GAIAXY 




almost every time he went to Eng- 
land He found - a couple of jour- 
nalists waiting for him — then, on 
arrival, to the ground staff at tHe 
airport so that he did not Have to 
appear publicly among the pas- 
sengers in the customs Hall, and 
still later to tHe car-hire firm from 
whom He rented a small incon- 
spicuous family sedan. 

He was. However, reasonably 
content witH His precautions wHen 
He picked His way around the 
northern fringes of London under 
a dull autumnal sky which occa- 
sionally sKed a Half-hearted driz- 
zle on him. Tomorrow, or the 
next day, when Casson called 
with the latest of his useless scraps 
of information, it would be a real 
pleasure to announce that he Had 
already been to see the man wKo 
published the FactsHeets and Had 
closed a favorable deal witK him. 
That would be the first of a se- 
ries of carefully chosen wounds 
intended to compel Casson’s even- 
tual resignation. It would work. 
He had done it often enough be- 
fore. 

T^espite tHe gloominess of tfie 
afternoon He began to wfiis- 
tle as He drove along. 

On reaching tHe small town 
whicH was His destination, How- 
ever, He grew puzzled. He Had ex- 
pected to find tHe street named 
on tHe letter He carried at the cen- 
ter of tfie town; in his experience, 
FACTSHEET SIX 



even tfiougK businessmen decen- 
tralized away from the metropo- 
lis, tfiey liked to centralize in' tHe 
places tfiey moved to. After niucK 
aimless driving back and forth, fie 
asked a pedestrian and was di- 
rected to tfie outskirts, to a drab 
postwar Housing development 
lacking all character and all 
cKarm. At the end of a cul-de-sac 
fie found a large bungalow witfi 
one lighted window, tHe garden; 
before it overgrown witK weeds, 
the door of the adjacent garage 
wide open to reveal that there was 
no car inside. 

But the street bore the rigKt 
name, and the right number was 
on the gatepost. 

Grey parked the car and got out 
slowly. This low-income neigfi- 
borh’ood, this badly-maintained 
House witH its wild garden, did 
not fit his preconceived idea of 
the brilliant inventor of tHe Fact- 
sHeets. Could He Have been Hoax- 
ed? He reminded Himself tfiat tfie 
letter He Had received was clearly 
from the same typewriter as tfie 
FactsHeets, sKrugged and walked 
up the patfi, noticing tKat it was 
concreted where one migfit Have 
expected gravel and tfiat tHe 
weeds Had been cut back along 
its edges. 

It was full dark by now, and 
the nearest street-lamp was too 
far away to illuminate tfie front 
door of tfie bungalow. He went 
the last few feet cautiously, not 

149 




wanting to trip over a step. There 
was no step. That struck him as 
peculiar, but he couldn’t decide 
wfiy. It was pro^'ably not ^nifi- 
cant, anyway. 

He felt across the door jamb 
until he located a bell and pushed 
it. Shortly an overhead light went 
on, and the door was opened for 
him. 

“Yes?” a voice said, and then, 
changing instantly to a tone he 
could not decipher: “Ah’, it’s 

Mr. Mervyn Grey, isn’t it? Come 
in, please. It’s cold and nasty out, 
isn’t it?” 

Staring, he failed to respond for 
a moment. He hated to be at a 
loss, but this — this creature who 
had appeared before him was so 
totally askew from the mental 
pictures he had conjured up that 
he was astovmded. 

He was in a wheelchair, to be- 
gin with — a battery-operated 
wheelchair with’ controls on the 
right arm rest. His left arm was 
shriveled, and the Hand twisted, 
doubled back almost at right an- 
gles to the wrist. His legs were 
concealed under a gray blanket 
spotted with gravy marks and a 
smear of egg yolk. Above a wool- 
len shirt with a button missing, 
half his face was covered with an 
untidy brown beard, but the other 
half was a smooth keloid, almost 
purple, reaching from cheekbone 
to jaw. Both’ the eyes. However, 
were alert and piercing, and un- 

150 



der their intent gaze he grew un- 
comfortable. 

“Are you George Handling?” 
he forced out. 

“That’s right,” the man in the 
wheelchair nodded. 

“The person who publishes the 
Factsheets?” 

“Yes! Look, don’t jrist stand 
there — you’ll make the House 
cold if I have to keep the door 
open, and heating is bloody ex- 
pensive these days.” 

But I should have ihou0ti you 
made enough from using the Pact- 
sheets to — 

Grey bit the words back. 
Numbed by the possibility that 
all his deductions had been false, 
and he had merely stumbled 
across a lunatic after all. He step- 
ped inside and now had a chance 
to survey his surroundings. This 
was the most peculiar house He 
had ever been in. The reason for 
not having a step at the front 
door had been instantly clear 
when Handling appeared in His 
chair, but the logic of that went 
all through his Home. The intern- 
al walls had been knocked away, 
giving an open plan complete, ex- 
cept for what he guessed must be 
a bathroom at the back. There 
was a bed in one place, with a 
curtain which could be drawn 
around it; there were cases of 
books in another, a desk with a 
typewriter on it in another, a 
lithographing press in another, 

GALAXY 




stacks of paper and big cartons 
of envelopes nearby. 

Moving with the automatic 
jerkiness of a puppet, he followed 
Handling across the open floor 
towards , the desk. There was a 
large paraffin stove burning there, 
of the convector-radiant type with 
a hot wire mesh glowing in the 
middle of a chromed reflector, but 
despite that and despite what 
Handling had said about shutting 
the door to keep the place warm 
the house was very cold. 

Or was the feeling subjective, 
due to shock. 

C(Qit down,” Handling said, 

^ swinging his chair expertly 
around so that it cleared the stove 
by inches. He tilted his head to- 
wards a chair with papers and a 
tea cup on it. “Sorry you Have to 
move all those things, but I can’t 
have things on the floor — they 
get in my way, for one thing, and 
I can’t reach to pick them up, for 
another. I have to go and get my 
tongs if I drop something. Well! 
I suppose 1 ought to offer you a 
drink, oughtn’t I? Only I Haven’t 
any. One doesn’t get much pleas- 
ure out of it in my condition. I 
could make you a cup of tea, if 
you like.” 

Grey had found a place for the 
cup and papers on the end of the 
desk and had taken a little longer 
than necessary in arranging them 
there, just in case there was a 
152 



sample entry from the next Fact- 
sheet to be seen. But there was 
nothing — only a stack of blank' 
paper and Half a dozen hand- 
written letters, upside down. 

“No — ah — no thank you,” 
he said, forcing himself towards 
normality. “I suppose I should 
really have let you know when to 
expect me, but . Well, to be 
frank, your FactsHeets have im- 
pressed me so much that the mo- 
ment I knew where to find you I 
just dropped eversdhing.” 

“Oh, there was no need to warn 
me of your arrival,” Handling 
said, and chuckled. “No need at 
all. I could say I’m flattered at 
your taking the trouble to fly the 
Atlantic just to call on me, but I 
doubt if there’s any need for that, 
either.” 

Grey’s eyes roved the mon- 
strous room into which the House 
had been converted, spotting here 
and there among the general 
bachelor disarray of shirts Hung 
on chair-backs and stacks of old 
newspapers things which gave 
some anchor of credence to Han- 
dling’s identity. He recognized the 
familiar red cover of the British 
Industrial Annual, a number of 
commercial directories, publicity 
material and prospectuses from 
various large companies of which 
he himself had copies in his office 
on Grand Bahama. He said, al- 
most at random and to cover his 
inquisitiveness, “Well, you’ll have 

GALAXY 




gatiiered from our advertisements 
tKat I’m most interested in your 
publication.” 

“Advertisements?” Handling 
said. 

Grey blinked af Em and im- 
mediately had to look away again 
— the sight of that fungoid patch 
of scar-tissue among the unkempt 
beard threatened to turn his stom- 
ach. 

"Why, of course! That was why 
you wrote to me, wasn’t it? We 
advertised in the Financial Times 
and the Economist and . .” The 
words trailed away, and he stared 
around the house again. Nowhere 
was there a sign, among all the 
heaps of old newspapers, of the 
conspicuous pink of the Financial 
Times. 

“Oh, I wouldn’t know about 
that,” Handling said, with an 
abortive attempt at a shrug which' 
struck Grey as rather Horrible. 

“Then how did you know I was 
interested in your work?” 

“It’s a trade secret, Mr. Grey,” 
Handling said, and gave a noise 
closer to a simper than a chuckle. 
“You’ve seen at least one of my 
productions, haven’t you? Then 
you know I have a great many 
trade secrets.” 

/^rey was conducting a furious 
debate with himself. An un- 
clean cripple in a wheelchair was 
so far from the image he had 
mentally created of a gifted and 
FACTSHEET SIX 



prosperous market manipulafor 
that he was half-minded to difl^ 
miss Handling as the crank Be 
had at first assumed, when CaS' 
son showed him FactsHeet Five. 
Yet there was incontestably a 
fund of credulity, tapped by Han- 
dling, wEcH he could exploit if 
he had the chance. He would 
have to be tactful. Even if l£e 
man proved to have been derang- 
ed by his awful condition, He 
could be used.' 

“Yes, they impressed me enor- 
mously,” he said, forcing warmth 
into his voice. He linked his fin- 
gers together, realized He Had 
forgotten to take off his driving- 
gloves and decided against remov- 
ing them now because the House 
still felt bitterly cold. “Inside in- 
formation like yours could be 
worth a fortune, handled in the 
proper way. In fact — Well, never 
mind that.” 

“You were probably going to 
say you’re surprised to find the 
possessor of it living in a jerry- 
built bungalow in an ugly devel- 
opment on the fringe of a dull, 
little provincial town,” Handling 
said. His tone was quite unemo- 
tional. “But it’s easier to keep out 
of people’s way here, Mr. Grey. 
And besides, I no longer have 
any use for a fortune. I had a 
wife. I had a son. They both died 
in the accident which reduced me 
to this state.” 

“I — I’m sorry,” Grey said'. 

153 




inank you for being sorry.” 
There didn’t seem to be any 
way to follow up that remark. 
Casting about for a way to 
change the subject, Grey said, 
“But you must have some pur* 
pose in publishing th'ese bulletins 
of yours. Or is it just a Hobby?" 

“It’s more than a Hobby. It’s 
practically a full-time occupation. 
Compiling the information is a 
slow job in itself, and then there’s 
the business of making the litHb 
plate and running off tHe actual 
sheets and addressing all tHe en- 
velopes . Oh, it keeps me very 
well occupied.” 

“I see.” Grey licked his lips. 
“How do you manage to Have the 
sheets sent from so many differ- 
ent places? I don’t imagine you 
mail them yourself.” 

“Oh no. There’s a commercial 
service which' collects them and 
takes them anywhere I cHoose 
within a hundred miles for quite 
a small fee. I thought I’d muddle 
the trail a little until I was ready 
to show myself.” 

“You — ah — you have a big 
mailing list now?” 

“I started off with five hun- 
dred, picked more or less at ran- 
dom,” Handling said. “This 
month it will be over a thousand.” 
“No wonder it keeps you busy! 
Ah ... I’d have appreciated be- 
ing included in the list myself, 
by the way.” 

“Oh, you aren’t at all the sort 
154 



of person I aimed it at,” Handling 
exclaimed. “I worked it all out 
very carefully. Tfiere are certain 
key figures in tfie financial world 
of this country, and you can find 
out who they are if you put lots, 
of little bits of published informa- 
tion together. It took me several 
months to make my list up, but 
that was all right. I Had plenty 
of time on my hands. Or rather, 
on my hand." He picked up the 
limp left one with tHe live right 
and regarded it curiously, as 
though he had come upon a dead 
frog in tHe garden. “I selected 
people administering the very big 
investment funds, people concern- 
ed with important exports, people 
responsible for choosing the 
brands of goods which are sold 
in the biggest chain stores all over 
the country, and so on. People 
whose decision to accept or not 
to accept a company’s products 
could make or break the com- 
pany, you see?” 

Grey gave a cautious nod. “And 
why did you choose them in par- 
ticular?” he ventured. 

“Oh, because of the kind of in- 
formation I was getting,” Hand- 
ling said. “They seemed to me 
to be the people who ought to be 
told what I knew. You’ve seen 
the sort of stuff I get!” 

“Ah' — yes, of course I Have. 
But why that information? How 
do you come by it?” 

“I’m a psychometrist. PsycHo- 
GALAXY 




metry is a brancli of clairvoyance. 
Actually I think the whole thing 
is all part of an all-embracing 
talent which will eventually be 
fully revealed to us, but that’s by 
the way. I get odd extras every 
now and then — the curtain lifts, 
as the sajring goes. Sometimes I 
can glimpse the future, sometimes 
I can deduce or sense what a per- 
son is thinking, but my specialty 
is being able to work out from 
objects their associations with' in- 
jury and death.” 

IV 

TT^/iaf a farretgo of nonsense. 
~ ' All Grey’s enthusiasm for 
getting Hold of the FactsKeet 
mailing list evaporated on tfie in- 
stant. He got to his feet 

“Well, thank you very much, 
Mr. Handling. I’m sorry to Have 
taken up your time. However, if 
you’re really restricting your 
mailing list to — ” 

“Oh, really, Mr. Grey!” Hand- 
ling cut in. “You didn’t Honestly 
come all the way from the Baha- 
mas just for five minutes’ chat 
and not even a peek at FactsHeet 
Six, did you?” He added after a 
fractional pause, “This one is de- 
voted to firms you’d be especially 
interested in.” 

Grey wavered. On the one 
hand, the cripple was certainly 
a crank; on the other, he had 
certainly influenced the market. 
FACTSHEET SIX 



“Yes, I should like to look at 
number six,” he admitted. 

“I thought so!” Handling crow- 
ed and moved his wheelchair 
around the desk, once more miss- 
ing the paraffin stove by a frac- 
tion. He tugged open a drawer 
and peered in. 

“Unfortunately it looks as 
though I only have spoiled copies 
left,” he went on. “Yes, that’s a 
spoiled one, and that’s blank on 
one side, and .... Never mind, 
it won’t take a moment to put 
the second side on it. I still have 
the plate on the machine.” 

Dexterously he Headed for the 
lithb press. His deftness with only 
one hand, Grey admitted silently, 
was admirable, although every- 
thing he had to do was necessari- 
ly slow. He waited impatiently; 
meanwhile Handling, disinclined 
to hurry, chatted away. 

“Yes, this talent of mine I sup- 
pose must always Have been with 
me, at least in rudimentary form. 
For example, I never wanted to 
buy that washing machine which 
chopped my little bo3r’s hand off; 
but of course it was a lot cheaper 
than all the others, and we 
weren’t exactly rolling in money, 
so I gave in. And I had my doubts 
about the sewing machine, too, 
but Meg couldn’t go out to work 
for a long while after the — ” 
“Did you say your son lost his 
hand?” Grey said in a dead voice. 
“Why, yes. The washing ma- 

155 




chine wfisn’t fitted with one of 
tho?e automatic brakes, you see, 
so you could have the wh'afsit 
going round while the lid was 
open; and without any water in 
it, it spun amlazingly fast, and 
poor little Bobby managed to 
turn it on and lift the lid, and 
... Ah, here we go now, or rather 
in a moment when the thing’s 
warmed up. Yes, like I was say- 
ing: Meg couldn’t go out to work 
for a long while after the soleplate 
of her iron fell on her thigh and 
the burn turned septic — not 
much of an iron, but it was very 
cheap, of course — and then the 
sewing machine she’d bought to 
make a little extra at home ran 
wild and stitched across the palm 
of her hand, and it was while I 
was driving her to the hospital 
that it happened. The tires on 
the car, you see. I had my doubts 
about those as well; but we were 
pretty skint, what with' Meg not 
going out to work, so I had to 
settle for what I could afford 
when it was absolutely essential 
to get new tires, and there was 
Meg crying and nursing her hand, 
and Bobby on the back seat 
squalling because he didn’t have 
a hand to nurse any more, you 
see, and . Ah, here’s your copy 
now. Complete.” 

He rolled back across the floor 
to a spot directly facing Grey and 
held out the piece of papter, bold- 
ly headed FACTSHEET SIX. 
156 



"ATechanically Grey took it, 
didn’t look down. His e 



but 

eyes 

were riveted on Handling’s face. 
He heard himself say, “So — 
what happened?” 

“According to the policeman 
who explained at the inquest, 
those tires tend to spring away 
from the wheel-rim when you go 
round a comer fast, and of course 
this lets all the air out — they’re 
tubeless, you understand — and 
the car just went completely out 
of control. Smashed into a lamp 
standard. Meg and Bobby were 
lucky, I suppose. Certainly I 
couldn’t have done much’ to sup- 
port them in this condition. But 
it was while I was laid up in the 
hospital that I began to discover 
my talent. All of a sudden one 
day when I was being given an 
injection I said, ‘The last man 
who had a shot from that one 
died, didn’t he?’ And they 
thought I was just being morbid, 
but I felt sure. So I started fol- 
lowing it up. And what I found 
was that I could — well — sense 
when I took hold of something 
whether it, or anything like it, 
was going to hurt someone. 

“At first I could only get 
snatches, but I had lots of time, 
especially before I got this chair 
and had to wait in bed for some- 
one to attend me. The worst snag 
was that I thought the things I 
was detecting had already hap- 
pened, so I was sort of straining 

GALAXY 




the wrong way into time to get 
at them. I can’t make it very 
clear, I’m afraid. It doesn’t hap- 
pen to many people. 

“Then I suddenly realized that 
I was feeling forward — not 
backward — and I got the Hang 
of it, properly. Mark you, it could 
never be a quick job, working out 
one of these things. Sometimes, 
especially with the real mass- 
production items, I spent up to 
thirty-six hours struggling before 
I sorted it out and could afford 
to go to sleep and rest up.’’ 

Almost hypnotized by Hand- 
ling’s sudden burning intensity. 
Grey could not drag his eyes 
away from the ruined face 
straight ahead of him. He said, 
“What — what exactly is it you 
do?’’ And reflected with para- 
doxical detachment that it was a 
change for him to be dominated, 
however briefly. He told himself 
he was putting up with’ it, though’, 
because . he wanted to be com- 
pletely convinced that the man 
was out of his mind. Cltherwise 
he might suffer from the pangs 
of disapf>ointment. 

“It’s more sort of what I did,” 
Handling explained in a thought- 
ful tone. “I told you — when I 
first started sensing that the other 
things which matched what I 
was holding would hurt such-and- 
such a number of people I 
thought this was what had al- 
ready taken place. But I found 
FACTSHEET SIX 



out that sometimes the thing I’d 
picked on was too new to have 
done all that, so then I realized 
the truth. I could sense what wa.s 
going to happen. Oh, no doubt 
you’ll say how could I be sure? 
Well, I couldn’t, could I? Not 
until I’d checked up. So I noted 
down everything I thought was 
exact, and whenever I got the 
chance I cross-referenced my 
notes. Like the Consumers’ Asso- 
ciation tests were very helpful, 
when they said that something 
I’d worked on was unusually 
dangerous, and sometimes I 
found things in the paper about 
food-poisoning and toys being 
dangerous to children and so on. 
After about a year or so, I was 
absolutely certain I was right.” 
“Oh, but this is ridiculousl” 
Grey forced out. “How could you 
know about — well, twenty thou- 
sand unwanted children, to take 
a really far-fetched example?” 
“The numbers sort of add up 
in my subconscious,” Handling 
said. “I lie awake at night, and 
I can feel them ticking away in 
my head. When they stop, I can 
feel how long they’ll take to reach 
that total — three months, six 
months, a year. And then I write 
it all down. When the time is up, 
I put it into my current Fact- 
sheet and off it goes to all these 
people. I did think of other ways 
of spreading the news, but I de- 
cided they wouldn’t work so well. 

157 




I mean, the newspapers are con- 
trolled by the advertisers, aren’t 
they? And the consumer journals 
have their own tests and their 
own way of goiog about it. Not 
as good as mine, but there it is. 
And they’re definitely taking no- 
tice now. Especially since — you 
did say, didn’t you, that you’d 
advertised to get in touch with 
me?” 

“Yes.” Grey bit the word off 
short, like the snap of wire-cut- 
ters. 

“You could tell it was you, 
from the advertisements?” 

“Yes!” Grey felt the prickle of 
sweat inside His clothes. How 
could he have imagined that this 
house was cold and Have kept on 
his coat, his gloves and scarf? It 
was boiling in here! 

“Well, that certainly ought to 
convince everyone that I’m worth 
paying attention to,” Handling 
said smugly. The virtual echo of 
his own remark to Casson galled 
Grey. 

“It’s a load of garbage!” He 
exclaimed. “Taking hold of some- 
thing and sa3nng that during the 
next year it’s going to Hurt or 
kill so many people — you must 
be insane! And this Factsh'eet of 
yours is nothing more than a 
grandiose confidence trick!” 

“You may not believe me, Mr. 
Grey,” Handling said softly. “But 
the best part of a thousand peo- 
ple are going to when they open 
158 



their mail tomorrow morning. The 
mailing company collected Fact- 
sheet Six this afternoon, and it’s 
on it’s way. Aren’t you even curi- 
ous to know what’s in it this 
time?” 

/^rey raised the hand which 
held his copy, intending to 
ball it up and march out, but 
from the corner of his eye He 
spotted three words that petrified 
him: Metvyn Grey Enterprises, 
Horrified, he read down the page. 

Miracle Whirl washing-ma- 
chines electrocuted so many peo- 
ple through faulty wiring, started 
so many domestic fires, leaked

irons started other fires, came 
apart in use and burned the user; 
cars shod with Ultrac tires were 
involved in so many fatal acci- 
dents ... 

His head was ringing as he 
thought of the people to whom 
this list of accusations was going 
and the buying power they con- 
trolled and the markets they 
could slam the door on. He bare- 
ly heard Handling say, “Yes, it 
was a Miracle Whirl which cost 
my boy his hand, and one of your 
irons that kept Meg at Home so 
she had to try and make money 
sewing with one of your machines 
which stabbed her hand, and if

whicK wrecked the car while I 
was rushing her to the hospital. 
You have more than just blood 
on your hands, Mr. Grey. You 
have all kinds of suffering. You 
seem to have hurt at least one 
person for every day of your 
life.” 

“You bastard,” Grey whisper- 
ed. He thrust the leaflet into the 
side pocket of his overcoat. “You 
can’t do this! It’s libel — it’s a 
filthy, dirty, stinking libel!” 

“There’s no libel about saying 
that a product is faulty,” Hand- 
ling said and grinned. “Oh, you 
could certainly sue me! I suppose 
I’ve committed a civil tort. But 
I haven’t committed any kind of 
crime." 

“You smug devil!” Grey roar- 
ed, and hurled himself bodily 
forward. Cripple or no cripple, 
he had to wipe that grin off 
Handling’s face! 

But the impact drove Hand- 
ling’s wheelchair backward, and 
it rammed straight into the par- 
affin stove, and knocked it over 
and spilled a sea of blazing oil 
instantly over thirty square feet 
of the floor. Flames soared up, 
high as Handling’s head. There 
was a sudden image seared into 
Grey’s retinas, a distorted face 
with eyes perfectly round, mouth 
open in a choking gasp that drew 
in sterile oxygenless air, beard 
crisping and hair writhing like 
Medusa’s snakes — 

FACTSHEET SIX 



And he was out of the house, 
and the door was shut behind 
him, and he was running for his 
car. He jumped in, started the 
engine, accelerated wildly down 
the road. Just before he turned 
out of sight, hie glanced back. As 
yet, there was ho sign of fire 
from outside the house; the cur- 
tains were drawn against the cold 
autumn night, and so were every- 
one else’s on the street That fact 
too became a still image in mem- 
ory, like a stopped movie. 

V 

F orty miles away, on a lonely 
roadside, he stopped the car 
again. Siuvering, yet bepnning to 
recover his self-possession, he 
drove himself to rational exami- 
nation of his situation. It wasn’t 
so bad — was it now? He could 
hardly conceal the fact being 
in England altogether, but there 
was no reason at all for it<^o be 
known that He’d vhuted Hand- 
ling’s hometown. He’d spoken to 
exactly one person, to ask direc- 
tions — but he’d done so at dusk, 
from the shadowy interior of a 
car identical to thousands of 
others. Long before anyone no- 
ticed that Handling’s home was 
burning, he had been well clear 
(rf the town, perhaps over the 
county border. He concentrated 
on the memory of the deserted 
street Yes, it could Have been a

long while before anyone noticed 
the firel 

And no one Had seen Him ar- 
rive, or leave, and that minor 
miracle of not taking off Qs 
gloves meant h'e could Have left 
no fingerprints, and He could go 
quietly back to London, to tHe 
apartment wKicH was always, 
ready for Him to walk into with- 
out notice, and He could go out 
nonchalantly to a club wHere He 
was known and Have dinner and 
watch a good cabaret, and to- 
morrow morning at about ten 
o’clock He could let it be dis- 
creetly known in circles wKere it 
counted tKat tKis time tHe Fact- 
sHeet was a tissue of lies and tfie 
financial empire of Mayya Grey 
Enterprises was in no danger, no 
danger at all, and — 

The FacfsHeetl 

Frantically He fumbled in tfie 
pocket of His coat and drew out 
tHe bit of paper. Tfiis was tHe 
only thing to link Qm with Hand- 
ling. He must get rid of it at 
once. On tHe point of winding 
down the window and throwing 
it out, he canceled tHe move- 
ment and instead took out His 
lighter. In another minute tKis 
could be anonymous wind-blown 
ashes, and He would be safe. OH 
yes, and the letter from Handling, 
of course! Lord! Had anyone seen 
that, in the Grand Bahama of- 
fice? Well, then; just in case, he 



could walk into Casson’s office 
in the morning, saying He’d been 
too tired to go straight there tKis 
afternoon, and announce His in- 
tention of visiting Handling . , 
Yes, that way would be all rigKt, 
too. He’d be perfectly safe. Even 
if people believed the FactsKeet 
and he lost a lot of money, Ke 
still had the talent which Had 
made him the Boy Wonder of the 
Business World. He could sur- 
vive. 

Snapping the lighter, he held 
the copy of Factsheet Six towards 
its flame. The instant before ig- 
niting it, he stopped dead. This 
time, he was looking at the second 
side of the sheet. He was looking 
at a paragraph bordered with 
black lines, inaccurately hand- 
drawn with a wide felt pen. 

Inside the border, in Handling’s 
usual bad typing, it said : 

This is the last issue of Fact- 
sheet. The publisher, Mr. George 
Handling of 29 Wyebird Close, 
Blentham, was murdered yester- 
day by Mr. Mervyn Grey in an 
attempt to stop this information 
being circulated. 

He sat there for a long time 
thinking of a thousand people of 
great influence opening the plain 
envelopes which would arrive in 
tomorrow morning’s mail. When 
he had finished thinking about 
it, he just sat.

know, some day it won’t 
matter How many books 
Isaac Asimov wrote. THat is, it 
won’t matter wHeth’er a given 
reader does or does not enjoy the 
given Asimov book He Happens to 
be reading. The dust wrappers, 
with their foolish blurbs, will be 
gone, and the books will be in 
sturdy library rebinds, nearly in- 





distinguishable from other vol- 
umes by other individuals . ex- 
cept by their content. This is an 
important fact, and you should 
make every effcjtt to grasp it de- 
spite the shouting and huckster- 
ing in the blurb copy now. Be- 
cause some day, sure as God 
made little apples, long after you 
and I are gone, Maggie, someone 
will pick up a copy of Pebble in 
The SHy and look beyond the 
intergalactic politics fo the story 
of the aging little CScago tailor 
whirled away from ^ own time 
and caught in the middle of them. 
He will think of A^mov as the 
author of that book, the creator 
of that character, and He will read 
other Asimov in search of earlier 
and later echoes of that plangent 
crystallization. Beyond the robots 
and Hari Selden he will find The 
Mule, and He will find Dr. Wen- 
dell UrtB. 

Four of the thirteen short sto- 
ries in Asimov’s Mysteries (Dou- 
bleday) are about Urth (and his 
stooge, H. Seton Davenport), and 
several others could Have been. 

Dr. Urth is a funny man wear- 
ing funny hats, an "extraterrolo- 
gist” stuck with dozens of tics in 
addition to ^at misnomer, a rea- 
soning being who has to put up 
with people who all the time think 
it strange an expert on affairs 
extraterrestrial should be a seden- 
tary agoraphobe. Urth of course 
makes perfect sense; it is the 
162 



world, as represented by the com- 
mon social order, that is mad as 
only the half-educable can make 
it. I suspect there is an obvious 
reason why he is so good at catch- 
ing antisocials at long distance. 
He simply puts himself in their 
place. 

Worse than any other task to 
which he’s called, he has to play 
a sort of balding Sherlock Holmes 
in the stories which mention Hinj 
Here. These are all rather con- 
trived and not particularly enter- 
taining tales. They demonstrate 
that a sufficiently educated and 
intelligent man can attempt to 
do anjrthing. They do not dem- 
onstrate He will succeed graceful- 
ly- 

If Asimov, or anyone else, were 
ever to succeed in attaining that 
amalgam which this book claims 
for itself. Be would have succeed- 
ed in entering through two doors 
simultaneously. I realize Isaac 
could now, easily, without strain- 
ing surface logic, write a story 
whose central character achieves 
simultaneity. But that would only 
prove my point. 

My point is that this arbitrary 
collection of thirteen stories — 
this chautaqua — contains some 
fine individual divertissements — 
“Pate de Foie Gras,” for example, 
is a humor article disguised as a 
detailed report on the physiology 
of a goose laying golden eggs. Or 
“The BiUiaid Ball,” for its inci- 

GAIAXY 




dental depiction of a sometimes 
very real mood generated in tKe 
world of science. Some of its best 
stories are tKose wtiicK are not 
"mysteries” at all, and are Here 
on a semantic pass. But on bal- 
ance, tHis is a poor book because 
it is a book about clevernesses, 
and clevernesses are not Isaac’s 
long suit. 

A man may master tKe mecK- 
anics of card tricks. Harder — or 
many of us would do prestidigi- 
tation all tKe time — is tKe cruel

of The Best Tales of Hoffman 
($2.00) being a collection of works 
by E. T. A. Hoffman, wKo anti- 
cipated my own birtK in Konigs- 
berg by a matter of about a Hun- 
dred and a Half years. His birtK 
year is 1776, as a matter of fact, 
and if tKese two things are not 
enough to convince you of His im- 
probability, then consider the fact 
that he was a gifted music critic 
and competent composer, destined 
to find ultimate fame in the title 
of a mediocre work by someone 
else. 

He was also very much a part 
of tKe general Romantic literary 
movement which reacted in some 
writers, sucK as Mary SKelley and 
Hoffman, to produce protots^i- 
cal considerations of tKe man/ 
machine confrontation under the 
guise of science fiction. (It’s inter- 
esting tKat Lord Byron and Percy 
SKelley were too busy, in tSe end, 
to actually produce tKeir aborted 
contributions to this sub-genre. 
Apparently, you Had to be not 
quite first-rate to get it down on 
papCT).

duced, it appears excellently, by

was not, blurb to the contrary, 
"one of tKe two or three greatest 
writers of fantasy.” (Bleiler works 
for Dover). TKat is a very large 

163 




ch’uak to chew off. But this man, 
who vras real and who thoiight 
some very interesting thoughts, 
did lay down the groundwork for 
some of (}iir most enduring 
tfemes. 

I recommend “The Golden 
Flower Pot,” “Automata,” and 
“The Sand-Man” particularly. 
But there are seven others, and I 
tl^k that if you get this book, 
read it and place it on your per- 
manent shelves, you will come 
back to it often. 

Qcience-fiction writers for, oh, 
thirty years, Have been active- 
ly learning from Robert A. Hein- 
lein. All of us, I t£nk, have in- 
fluenced our own careers by our 
private assessments of tiis techni- 
cal accomplishments and His pro- 
fessional criteria. 

Occasionally, some of this 
thinldng Has become public, a 
tricky business while your sub- 
ject's still alive, because he can 
callously point out your factual 
errors, take personal umbrage, 
and otherwise refuse to hold any- 
where near as still as he does 
when it’s just you and your 
thoughts, musing of awards before 
an open fire. 

Take, for instance, the time a 
famously sharp technical mind in 
this business produced a schol- 
arly essay whose conclusion de- 
pended on the crucial assumption 
jttiat Heinlein Had never really 

164 



tackled time travel before The 
Door Into Summer. The essay 
skirted only around the edges of 
the fact that the time-travel story 
in its most effective form takes 
the construction “the son is the 
father is the son hereafter,” and 
never once mentioned “By His 
Bootstraps.” 

Such is the character of what 
musing on Heinlein can do to 
your otherwise deservedly famous 
analytical mechanism. Neverthe- 
less, the Heinlein- chasers go on, 
as we all must, and we are now 
arrived at yet another generation 
of writers who have to cope with 
their relationship to him . the 
more so because he is getting old, 
now, and they are so young that 
in their eyes he has always had 
snow on his upper slopes. 

It was about time that some- 
body attempted a full-scale study 
at thesis length, as Alexei Panshin 
has now done for Advent: Pub- 
lishers, Inc. 

Heinlein epitomizes all that is 
possible to the science fiction of 
the 1940’s. This distinct breed of 
story seems to have developed as 
a natural response to the needs 
of people who got their under- 
, graduate technological grounding 
in the 1930’s, and is characterized 
by a belief in the liberating effect 
of the Sc. D degree. 

An inspection of the best-re- 
ceived stories and series of the 
time will show that the hero is 

GALAXY 




commonly a figure of lower mid- 
dle-class origins, or alternatively 
of mysterious parentage, wlio 
emerges into His true artistocratic 
condition as a result of codified 
training and, often, supplemen- 
tary tutelage at tHe Hands of an 
avuncular figure. His maturity is 
signaled Hy sucH outward signs 
as tiie privilege of using lower 
middle-class slang in tiie labora- 
tory, doodling wiring diagrams on 
tiie tableclotiis of four-star res- 
taurants, and the concealment of 
the title “doctor” until under at- 
tack by sucK father-figures as, for 
instance, hostile corporate attor- 
neys. 

Within and upon these para- 
meters, Robert A. Heinlein has 
built a truly enviable career with 
remarkable elegance. He has 
struck the chord of liberation not 
only upon technicians but upon 
arts baccalaureate candidates, 
night school accounting students, 
chicken farmers, would-be sci- 
ence-fiction writers, editors of 
grocery trade magazines, infantry 
officers, former publicists for the 
NBC radio network, and all the 
other people who go on to make 
up the commercial world which 
we normally cite when we use 
the referent “contemporary so- 
ciety.” He has even struck it in 
rebels against this world, by of- 
fering such 180 -degree candidates 
a religion, in Strang/Br in a Strange 
Land. As long as you refer to the 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



societal system whose central 
event was the Great Depression. 
Robert A. Heinlein can be found 
to have been your spokesman in 
some cogent way at least once, 
and probably quite often. And of 
course we all do, in at least some 
second-generation way, refer to 
that system. So Heinlein speaks 
to us even though he displays cer- 
tain obvious impediments. 

Among these impediments are: 
A restricted range of male char- 
acterizations; a craftsman’s eye 
for prose functions, substituting 
the functions normally assigned 
to an ear for moods (Heinlein 
orchestrates eversrthing like Bo- 
lero) ; an even more restricted 
range of female characterizations; 
and what is either a fault or an- 
other champion three-legged run- 
ner’s talent — the frequently dem- 
onstrated capacity for producing 
a story which ends either before 
or after the clearly visible place 
where the plot resolves. 

I think these characteristic^- 
arise from the way Heinlein 
taught himself to write, which in 
turn arises from how Heinlein is 
wired up inside. But in the inter- 
ests of space, I will spare you. 
What is important here is that 
Alexei Panshin seems to have no- 
ticed all of these same things, 
though not in the same words, in 
His exhaustive study of Heinlein’s 
writings and as much as is knoWn 
of Heinlein’s biography. Yet as I 

165 




went through Heinlein in Dimen- 
sion (Advent: Publishers, Inc., 
P.O. Box 9228, Chicago, 111. 
60690. Cloth. $6.00), it seemed to 
me — seemed forcefully, painful- 
ly, frequently < — that Panshin had 
brought himself up to a crucial 
point, had perhaps even nudged 
at it, and then had gone off else- 
where. In part, this feeling arose 
in me because Panshin does not, 
in the end, come to any clear pic- 
ture of what Heinlein’s work 
fneans . what round his life has 
taken, what rough’ draft may to- 
day be discerned in the thing a 
future generation will descry as 
Heinlein’s statement. It seems to 
ttie that if you’re going to do a 
book about something, you should 
not in the end come out with’ a 
book about the parts of some- 
thing. however faithfully you de- 
scribe them and however thought- 
fully you guess at their sometimes 
fairly obvious functions within 
the largely undescribed whole. 

But let’s take what I think is 
the key example, of where Pan- 
shin goes off beside the point and 
Heinlein makes it : 

Panshin’s description of The 
Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Hein- 
lein’s most recent novel, is cru- 
cially flawed by, first, his over- 
looking the central fact about the 
book and, second, by how close 
Ee comes to not overlooking it. 

The overlooked central fact 
about The Moon is a Harsh Mis- 
166 



tress is that the hero is the com- 
puter, Mike. The problems in the 
story are most painful to the 
computer, the solutions imposed 
are best suited to the computer’s 
comfort and as events close the 
ragtags, the lingering doubts and 
curiosities expressed by Manuel, 
the narrator, are the expressions 
of a spearcarrier wondering what 
happened after hero and heroine 
have reached the climactic inter- 
penetration, and only the epi- 
logue remains to be spoken. 

Every review of Harsh Mistress 
I’m aware of made the intended 
error of mistaking viewpoint char- 
acter for protagonist. (And your 
humble servant was most ludi- 
crously in error of all, for it was 
in re-reading my own review in 
print that I finally caught on). 

Panshin speaks of Heinlein’s 
knowing full well what names 
mean. He has already said that 
“Michael” means “God-Like,” 
and he brings this up in mention- 
ing, disparagingly, that the ma- 
chine is somehow more forceful 
than the narrator. He makes 
nothing of it, though — and he 
makes nothing of the narrator’s 
name, which is Manuel. (The 
narrator, you may recall, has a 
. prosthetic arm which' he takes off 
or changes hands on at will, often 
— though not often to any overtly 
important purpose.) Manuel — 
and his fellow revolutionaries — 
respond as required, with' their 

GALAXY 




several talents, to the computer’s 
shifting computations of the po- 
litical events which', if they go 
wrong, will leave the computer 
intellectually sterile on the desti- 
tute, frigid body of Luna, after 
all the people in Her tunnels have 
died. Again Panshin repeatedly 
cannot account for Heinlein’s 
bringing peculiar marriage cus- 
toms into the story. The Moon is 
a Harsh Mistress. Panshin makes 
a point of the title’s overt mean- 
inglessness, too). 

Everybody knows, mind you, 
that machines have an excellent 
chance of attaining authority 
some day. (And everybody else 
writes books in which the view- 
point people either out-think or 
cower before some device which 
talks just like Jehovah, only loud- 
er. The former alternative con- 
tradicts the necessary premise 
that the machine is smarter than 
Man, while the latter contradicts 
visceral convictions. So these 
stories, while sometimes clever 
and occasionally admired by peo- 
ple who can suppress good sense 
with logic, are impermanent. Mis- 
tress, however, resolves things as 
they very likely would be . with 
even the most involved humans 
believing events had proceeded to 
their benefit, and perhaps feeling 
a little bit lost at the thought that 
somehow Mike, the ballistic com- 
puter, had gotten his exteroaffec- 



tors cut off by a lucky hit, but 
not really capable of reaching the 
truly monstrous realization that 
they had served their purpose and 
were now being ignored, all you 
zombies. 

Read in the light of this read- 
ing of Mistress, Panshin’s HoOk 
changes character as bittersweetly 
as does a re-reading of the novel. 
Panshin cites persistent traits of 
Heinlein’s stories: Boy Scout sex- 
uality combined with freakish 
consummations: the super-com- 
petent character with’ the added 
super-talents such as having a 
perfect memory, a camera eye, a 
gift for mathematics, plug-in tal- 
ents, etc. He notes Heinlein’s ob- 
sessive denial of personal death', 
his conviction that survival is the 
only test. He touches on, though 
fails to nail down, Heinlein’s con- 
verse conviction that it is also the 
only worthwhile challenge, in 
whose absence even genius lan- 
guishes. Panshin asks, again and 
again, “But where is the ultimate 
working-out of this trait? Where 
is Heinlein going with it? Where 
is the sign?’’ 

The sign may very well have 
occurred in The Moon is a Harsh 
Mistress. There is more symbol- 
ism here than you’ll find even in 
D. D. Harriman’s shipping tag 
knifed into the pumice.

Maxwell, and get that mess clean- 
ed up. And if you spend one god- 
damn penny over authorization, 
you’ll be down in the file room 
when you get back.” 

It saddened me how Jack’s 
threats had declined in beauty 
and vigor over the years. Maybe 
I was getting used to them, or 
maybe now I had so little to lose 
that no threat was very meaning- 
ful. After all, you make a man 
feel pretty large if you tell him 
he must do so-and-so or he will 
lose his shot at the Big Prize. You 
do nothing at all for his ego if 
you tell him he has to do it or 
lose the miserable job he already 
has. 

But I took his comments, as I 
had for some years, with consid- 
erable charity. He too was a dis- 
appointed man. He too had wait- 
ed all his working life with the 
Outfit for the big chance to be a 
Number One. And he was now 
too old to hope. 

At forty-three, I was very near- 
ly too old myself. I was fully re- 
signed to no greater expectations 
than to hang on to what I had 
and — at the most — to someday 
succeed Jack and snarl at other 
hopeless men, a far cry indeed 
from the glories we had both an- 
ticipated as young men. 

So I didn’t stay to argue as I 
used to do, but went straight to 
SECONDS' CHANCE 



Disbursing, signed my life away 
for a stack of hundred-dollaf 
travelers’ checks, and Hurtled to 
catch the subway to New York 
and the afternoon Superson to 
Berlin. I did not want to tarry 
for the pitying looks of my 
younger, still hopeful colleagues 
in the Office of Claims, Field 
Settlement EHvision. Thirteen 
years of cleaning up after the 
legendary Murphy ought to Have 
hardened me to those supercilious 
bastards. But it hadn’t. I found 
m 3 Tself comfortable only in the 
presence of my boss, who — ? as 
I have explained — was even far- 
ther down the road to permanent 
obscurity than I. 

Tn the hovercab down the Po- 
tomac to the subway station, 
I caught myself laughing out 
loud, a bitter sort of laugh. WKat 
a state things had fallen into! 
There was a time when the Out- 
fit recruited only men who Had 
— the phrase ran — “a passion 
for anonymity.” Well, it had all 
changed. Guys like Jack and I 
had the anonymity and $14,000 
a year; guys like Murphy had the 
passion, not a shred of anonymi- 
ty, and upwards of $35,000 a year 
plus a virtually unlimited ex- 
pense account. 

Back when I had joined up — 
fresh out of Vietnam, hungry to 
be a civilian again but unwilling 
to settle for the humdrum of 

169 




business or academic life — the 
Outfit had seemed to promise an 
exciting and rewarding career. 
But then, about the time I got 
out of training, skilled in small 
arms, dead-drq|ps, live drops, 
clandestine high- jinks of all 
kinds, the international espionage 
business went all to hell, at least 
as far as it involved the Ameri- 
cans and the Russians. 

So you launch a major opera- 
tion and find out the Sovs are de- 
ploying a brand-new multiple re- 
entry fractional orbit bombard- 
ment system with’ a C£.P. of a 
hundred yards and yields at the 
gigaton level. 

So what? It doesn’t effect the 
balance of power a micro-mini- 
miUigram. 

So you feed dozens of expend- 
ables to the opposition apparat 
and get hard information that 
there is going to be another 
Kremlin power struggle and the 
hard-liners will replace the soft- 
liners, or vice versa. 

So what? The political inertia 
of a polarized world, the kill and 
over-kill, the second strike and 
third strike capability on both 
sides, makes intelligence informa- 
tion take on all the relevance and 
pertinency of medieval arguments 
about angels on pin heads. 

^"T^he hovercab flopped down on 
the subway station apron like 
a landing gooney-bird, and I fol- 
170 



lowed the rest of the passengers 
through the turnstile, down the 
drop-chute, and into th'e New 
York capsule. There was the usu- 
al muffled sigh, the gentle accel- 
eration, and we plimged down the 
tube past the first sphincter. As 
it tightened behind us and we ac- 
celerated into the vacuum ahead, 
I tightened a few sphincters of 
my own. Tube travel frightens 
me. There is something of the 
claustrophobiac in all of us, and 
I never enter a capsule without 
remembering the holovision pic- 
tures of the Chicago pile-up in 
’ 81 . 

I sought distraction in my pre- 
vious train of thought. Espionage 
is like religion, I thought, which 
shows you what foolish things 
you think when you are frighten- 
ed. And they lost pertinacy at 
about the same time, I thought. 
And maybe there is some connec- 
tion. 

But granting that and having 
determined that a god is dead, 
how do you dismantle his church? 

The answer is, of course, you 
don’t. And the big-time espionage 
business is still just as big, still 
just as expensive. Only its pur- 
pose has diminished. Now it is a 
kind of international gladiatorial 
sport in which' all participants 
are as careful as they can be not 
to do each other serious damage. 
Accidents sometimes happen. 
But I couldn’t recall hearing of 

GALAXY 




a real assassination attempt 
against a professional on eitlier 
side since way back in tHe bad 
old days of Stalin. And even the 
professionals who foul up and 
arc taken prisoner can count on 
all the headlines of a show trial 
followed by some sort of exchange 
on the old Powers-Abel nnodel 
long before their prison pallor 
becomes very noticeable. 

It is a grand game, if you ate 
one of the few real players. Ev- 
eryone in it recognizes it for the 
game it is. We benchwarmers, 
though, don’t have such a good 
time of it. We do our menial 
tasks and wait with' vanishing 
hope for one of our first-stringers 
to get knocked out of the game 
or to retire from old age. 

But what the helll I thought 
as the capsule zipped along its 
chordal tube a hundred miles be- 
neath Philadelphia. What the 
hell; it is $14,000 a year, and 
there are two kids in college and 
there is the mortgage, and there 
win be retirement in ai>other doz- 
en years or so (fifty per cent of 
my high five). And for a lot of 
years it hadn’t been so bad. 
There’d been the hope that may- 
be sonvething would happen to 
Murphy, that maybe (contrary 
to all expectations) he’d grow 
tired of the big time, the lime- 
light, the perio^c performances, 
and retire while I was still young 
enough to step into his shoes. 
SECONDS' CHANCE 



Well, he hadn’t. And I wasn’t 
any longer. 

But what the hell, it was a liv- 
ing. 

T have always found Elast-West 

Superson flights disconcerting. 
“Vou leave Berlin, say, at 3:00 PM 
and get into New York at noon. 
The other way is even worse. The 
stewardesses hardly have time to 
say “cc^eeteaormilk,” and for the 
passengers, there is hardly enough 
time for die prilobennies to take 
effect, much l^s wear off for the 
landing. But despite their linger- 
ing effect, I could not overcome 
the gloom of Tempelhof. 

I hate >obs in Berlin. Not only 
has the vdiole population been 
raised on spy stories, but a con- 
siderable segment of it Still lives 
in one way or another off the in- 
telligence buaness. It may be still 
the best place in Europe to re- 
cruit expendables, but cleaning up 
after Murph there is a rerf Au- 
gean job. 

The little gray man at the 
Tempelhof PasskottiroIIe desk 
was familiar, and he recogi^ed 
me frcun previous trips. He waved 
my passport back into my pocket 
and gave me one of those sly, 
conspiratcmal Berlin smiles. "Ah! 
Herr Maxwell! We have been ex- 
pecting you!” His voice dropped 
to a stentorian whisper: “It is 
that the Murphy has been busy 
again, nicbt?" He held up the 

171 




previous day’s edition of Der 
Morgenpost. There was a muddy 
picture of a group of policemen 
herding a gaggle of men in hand- 
cuffs into the back of a carryall 
ductor. Under* the picture was 
an italicized headline, leaning 
against a row of exclamation 
F>oints and proclaiming: “Der 

Murphy hat wieder gesiegt!!!!!" 
— “Murphy again victorious!” 
Under it was a small cut of Mur- 
phy himself, bearded and fierce, 
and a two-column story on the 
roundup of another Soviet spy 
ring in Berlin followed by a box 
score of Murphy’s accomplish- 
ments against his opposite num- 
ber, Yevgenyi Komiev. I noted 
that the Outfit’s P-R section, big 
and well financed as it was, had 
fallen down again. The paper put 
the score at seventeen-fifteen. 
And there was no mention of the 
affair in Belgrade in ’82, which 
actually made it eighteen for 
Murph. 

"Wunderbat, the Murphy,” 
said the little man, the glint of the 
devoted, loyal fan in his eyes. 
“Such a record! And against the 
Korniev!” 

“Yeah, wunderbar,” I said. I 
returned the conspiratorial smile 
out of courtesy, without mirth. I 
did not want to get involved in a 
discourse on the relative merits of 
the greats of the past, although 
there was no doubt in my mind 
that Murph could have Held his 
172 



own with the very best of them. 

The little man leaned toward 
me across his counter, laid a con- 
soling hand on my sleeve, and let 
his angular face droop in good- 
natured sympathy. “But now, 
there will be much to do, lucht? 
Many, many people, Herr Max- 
well. I do not envy you.” 

“Yeah. Well, we’ll get it cleaned 
up.” I was getting so that I could 
no longer bear even the most 
heartfelt sympathy. I turned away 
abruptly. “I’ll be at the Hotel 
am Zoo if you come across any- 
thing.” 

The little man snapped his 
heels and touched his cap, pride 
and pleasure on his face. “Jawohll 
Herr Maxwell.” 

The first thing was to get an 
ad in the papers. I telephoned it 
from my room at the hotel. First 
Der Morgenpost and then the 
mass-circulation tabloid, B.Z.’. 

“Persons with valid claims for 
damages resulting from an inci- 
dent at the former Sector Border, 
corner of Klemmke Strasse and 
Dannenwalder Weg, at about 
0200 hours on 14 June, should 
contact Mr. Albert Maxwell, 
Room 243, Hotel am Zoo.” 

Both papers would hit the 
streets in the morning; I had the 
rest of the day to relax and read- 
just my plumbing after the trans- 
Atlantic time change. I unpacked, 
bathed, dined on room service 

GALAXY 




Wurst und Schrippen, and 
stretched out on the eiderdown 
with' a full bottle of Jameson to 
drink myself into a semblance of 
honest resignation, which' meant 
forgetting for a little while a 
hundred other Hotel rooms, two 
kids in college, the mortgage, and 
what I knew was coming tomor- 
row. 

'^he next morning, I was up, 
-*■ shaved, and breakfasted well 
before the first knock on the door. 

The Germans are go-getting 
people and — like I say — used 
to dealing with intelligence organ- 
izations. They get right on it, un- 
like the Italians and the Spanish. 
This is good, in a way. You can 
get an unpleasant job over with 
in very short order. The English 
are the worst. I’ve spent as much' 
as two weeks in London cleaning 
up after Murph’. The English are 
so goddam polite. And so law- 
abiding. They write letters first 
and call in their solicitors and 
telephone M16 or the War Office 
or Scotland Yard. 

The first claimant was one of 
the easy kind. He had his ductor 
parked nearby, around the comer 
on John Foster Dulles Allee. I 
took the sidewalk there with Him, 
photographed the hole in the right 
front pressure-shrouding of His ’81 
Opel and measured it. He had a 
claim, all right The hole was 
from an old-fasluoned .38 slug 
SECONDS' CHANCE 



and not a nine millimeter rocket 
dart or one of those great big 
dumdum cannons the Soviets 
sometimes like to pack. 1 chipped 
his claim down from 200 marks 
to 60, paid him, got a receipt, 
shook his hand and exchanged 
conspiratorial Berlin smiles with 
him and rode the sidewalk back 
to the hotel. If only they were all 
that easyl 

There was a line of people all 
the way down from my door to 
the bank of drop chutes. I groan- 
ed. Murph, the bastard, had out- 
done himself this time. Not ten 
o’clock and at least thirty people. 

The first half dozen or so were 
broken glass cases. With German 
efficiency, they had all come with 
glazers’ estimates in hand, and I 
paid up with argument. In all 
likelihood I was paying for a hell 
of a lot of damage that the Outfit 
really wasn’t accountable for, but 
the time and effort of digging out 
all those slugs from baby carri- 
ages and hightx> 3 ^ and antique 
Biedermeier clothespresses was 
far too great. Better to pay up. 
Even knowing that most of those 
people would be eagerly scanning 
Der Morg/snpost and B.Z. for 
signs that Federov or one of his 
people was in town settling claims 
for their side so they could double 
their profits. Sometimes I think 
that between them, since the es- 
pionage business went big-time 
and public, the Outfit and the 

173

KGB Have glazed Half the win- 
dows in Europe. 

T worked through the day and 
-*• well into the evening settling 
claims. There were the usual flesh 
wounds and — of course — the 
beneficiaries of the expendables, 
and one unusual case of a man 
who claimed damages for invol- 
untary coitus interruptus (which 
I paid, knowing damn well I’d 
have trouble with Disbursing over 
it), but no homicides showed up. 
I was grateful; but then it was 
only the first day. By eight 
o’clock I had finished 33 claims 
and paid out just over 8000 
marks, which — in case you are 
not familiar with the rate of ex- 
change — is about 2000 of your 
tax dollars. 

I hung the Nicht Storen! sign 
on the door and went down to 
the dining room for a drink and 
some dinner. 

Halfway through a greasy plate 
of Schweinefletsch und Salzkart- 
offeln, I looked up to see Federov 
standing expectantly on the other 
side of my table. Like most Rus- 
sians in official jobs, he is about 
a ninety-five per cent pain, but in 
a curious way I was always glad 
to see him. He was the one man I 
knew — other than my boss back 
in Washington — who had no oc- 
casion to feel sorry for me. I rose, 
gave him a stiff, one-pump. Cen- 
tral European handshake, and 

GALAXY 



waved him to a seat. I did not 
say, nor did he, “WKat brings you 
to Berlin?” We knew. 

Instead, I said: “When are you 
setting up shop?” 

Federov sighed with resigna- 
tion. “The announcement will ap- 
pear tomorrow in tfle press. You 
have already started, da?” 

I nodded and chewed my 
Schweinefleisch. 

Federov sighed again, a deep. 
White Russian sigh, the ridicu- 
lously wide lapels on his double- 
breasted suit sliding across each 
other like scissors. “It is a bad 
one, da?” 

I nodded again and swallowed. 
“33 claims first day.” 

Federov shook his round head, 
slumped in his chair and ran a 
trembling hand through his thick, 
graying hair. “Every time with 
Murphy and Korniev — ” 

His voice trailed off. I knew 
what he meant. Both of them 
sprayed slugs and rocket darts 
like small boys peeing in the 
snow. Murphy alone was bad 
enough, God knows. But Murphy 
and Komiev together . 

I finished all I could handle of 
the Schweinefleisch and rose to 
go. Federov looked at me plead- 
ingly. I couldn’t help feeling sorry 
for him, an unaccustomed emo- 
tion I rather enjoyed. Maybe it 
was the mutuality of our adver- 
sity. We’d worked quite a few 
jobs together over the past doifen 
SECONDS' CHANCE

years, and if anybody in the busi- 
ness had it rougher than I it was 
Federov. He had entered the 
KGB at about the same time I 
had entered ^e Outfit (I had 
seen his dossier as, I’m sure, he’d 
seen mine), and he undoubtedly 
had had the same bright dreams 
of glory. But his Number One, 
Korniev, showed every sign of be- 
ing even more durable than Mur- 
phy, and he was a little younger, 
a little farther from retirement. 
Murphy might have outpointed 
Korniev over the years. But the 
Soviet establishment is a little 
smaller than ours, and in his own 
country Korniev was a real na- 
tional hero. You couldn’t pick up 
a copy of Pravda or Novy Myr 
without seeing a picture of him 
or reading an account of his lat- 
est confrontation with The Forces 
of Capitalist Reaction. 

It’s tough' to play Number Two 
to a genuine champion. I know. 

“Okay,” I said, pulling the 
day’s tally from my pocket. 
“Here’s a list of the claims I’ve 
settled. But just once I wish to 
Christ you’d get some place be- 
fore I do and save me all the work 
and money I’m saving you.” 

Federov grinned weakly and 
stuffed the list in his breast pock- 
et. “Thank you,” he said. “It is 
for our mutual good, after all. 
Perhaps, in time, these people will 
learn they cannot get away with 
duplicate claims.” 

176 



“Fine,” I said, turning to go. 
“I’m all in favor. But next time, 

I wish you’d pay some of my 
claims and give me a list.” 
Federov gave a comical shrug. 
“I will try, but you know Cen- 
tral.” 

I headed for the drop chute 
bank. 

T he next morning the line in 
front of the door was small- 
er. By three o’clock in the after- 
noon I had disposed of a dozen 
more broken glass cases, three 
ductor and two automobile punc- 
tures (only one of which I paid; 
Korniev had apparently been 
armed with a little Fabrique Na- 
tional dart-gun and it was easy 
to distinguish his workmanship 
from Murphy’s), and a lady who 
claimed she had miscarried from 
fright. The price of miscarriages 
has gone way up in Berlin. I used 
to pay a flat 200 marks a throw 
back in ’69 and ’70, but since the 
East Germans took the Wall 
down, the price has more than 
doubled. 

I got the cable from the Outfit 
just as I was leaving to go down 
to dinner. I decoded it with my 
electric razor;

room. Federov was already there, 
and he beckoned me to His table 
with a shaking forefinger. His 
usual worried expression Had 
deepened. 

“You Have Heard about Tan-

“I Have Heard about Tangier.’’ 
“Shall we share a cab to the

I nodded as I stared at the

“You mean you’re going to Tan-

“Da. Komiev was also in Tan-

onto tHe carpet.

We dined in silence, smoked 
our cigars in silence and sepa- 
rated to clear our rooms. I packed, 
met Federov in the lobby and 
rode with him out to TempelHof. 
We shared nothing but the fare 
and a series of resigned sighs. 

A nd then, in the waiting room 
at Tempelhof, just before our 
Superson to Rome was due to be 
called, I was paged. There was a 
telegram. I left Federov staring 
gloomily out at the bright lights 
of the launch area, recovered my 
razor from my briefcase, and re- 
tired to the men’s room to deci- 
pher the cable:

was Central European Number 
One I Thirty-five thousand a year 
and my own Swiss bank account! 
All kinds of passion and no more 
anonymity! 

I grew awa^e of a buzzing and 
humming to my left. At another 
sink stood Federov, shaving a 
telegram. As He worked, Kis usu- 
ally gloomy visage brightened 
visibly. A smile spread from one 
great drooping ear to the other. 
He finished and stood grinning at 
his reflection which was grinning 
back at Him in the mirror. 

I cleared my throat and he 
turned away from his satisfied 
contemplation. “You too?” I ask- 
ed. “Did Komiev . .” 

There was new dignity in Fed- 
erov’s voice: “Da. There was a 
mistake. Comrade Komiev is in- 
capacitated, and I have been ap- 
pointed . .” 

I whirled and crouched, reach- 
ing for the minidart in my left 
sock. Federov leaped in a perfect 
pas de chat to the protection of a 
booth. I tried a snapshot at his 
feet under the door, and he climb- 
ed atop the toilet and tried a bank 
shot at me with his dumdum off 
the ceiling. It was plaster and 
didn’t bank shot very well. 

It was a standoff, and I paused 
to think. 

‘Tederov,” I called shrilly. 
“Hold it!” 

“Da,” Federov’s voice echoed 
from the booth. 

178 



“Let’s do this thing right. We’re 
both out of practice, and someone 
could get hurt. And furthermore 
there’s no press here.” 

“Dal” said Federov. 

“Come on out and let’s talk it 
over.” 

“Da. Only I stay inside the 
booth and we talk it over. You 
understand?” 

I shrugged. “Okay. Look, let’s 
get this thing organized and start 
off the right way. You get in 
touch with the Tass man and 
Deutsche Nachrich'ten Agentur; 
I’ll call Reuters, UPI, Agence 
France Presse and AP. Then let’s 
meet down along the old Wall line 
— say at the Checkpoint Char- 
lie Monument — at about two 
o’clock. ” 

'^here was silence in the booth 
for a moment and I began 
to worry about what Federov was 
up to. Then he spoke, his voice 
newly alight, full of suppressed 
excitement. 

“All right, Mr. Maxwell. I will 
call Comrade Stoniev and Herr 
Lempke. But the old Wall line, 
Mr. Maxwell? Not the old Wall 
line. Komiev and Murphy, they 
always met down at the old Wall 
line. We must establish — how do 
you say it in your country — a 
new image.” 

I Had to hand it to Federov 
He was way ahead of me there. 
“You are entirely correct, Com- 

GALAXY 




rade Federov,” I said. “Let us 
meet — ” I thought furiously — 
“let us meet in the Heart of Berlin, 
in the bright lights and crowds of 
the Ku’udam, the most fashion- 
able shopping street between Paris 
and Moscow I” I was astonished 
at the audacity of the idea and 
still I was very pleased with my- 
self. 

“Dal” said Federov with real 
enthusiasm. 

“There are bright lights there,” 
I said, growing excitement in my 
voice. 

“And many great glass show 
windows,” said Federov, His voice 
beginning to break with anticipa- 
tion. 

“And rows and rows of shiny, 
late-model ductorsi” I nearly 
shouted. 

“And hundreds of new holovi- 
sion sets all with implosive 
tubes!” 

“And windows full of expensive 
perfumes — ” 

“And rare antiques — ” 

“And bottles of booze — ” 

“And fine, inflammable cloth- 
ing—” 

“And . and . and — ” 

Federov broke from his booth, 
his dumdum dangling innocently 
at His side. We embraced each 
other and cried real tears of 
happiness.

an inch inshore of high water 
mark. This is not quite the truth; 
I don’t know quite as much about 
the harbor as I should, even 
though I hold a pilotage exemp- 
tion certificate for the port. None- 
theless, my knowledge is some- 
what greater than that of any 
non-seafarer, and on the occa- 
sions that we are visited by over- 
seas friends she will lay on a tour 
of inland points of interest in the 
car, and I will play my part by 
organizing some sort of harbor 
trip. 

The run from the Circular 



Quay to Manly is a very pleasant 
one, especially if it is a fine day 
and if the short voyage is made 
in one of the old-fashioned, dou- 
ble-ended ferries. The hydrofoils 
are all right for people in a hurry, 
but not so good for sight-seeing. 
And there is so much to see — 
points of historical interest such 
as Fort Dennison (known in the 
convict settlement days as Pinch- 
gut) and Bradley Head, where 
stands the foremast of H.M.A.S. 
Sydney, famous for her sinking 
of the German surface raider Em- 
den in the First World War. 
There are all the new things, such 
as the Opera House (regarding 
which I say nothing further) and 



all the mushrooming additions to 
Sydney’s skyline. There is the 
Bridge, of course. And there is 
all the traffic, military and com- 
mercial, to anybody who loves 
^ps a continual source of pleas- 
ure. 

There were three of us making 
the ferry trip to Manly that day 
— two American friends, man 
and wife, both writers, and my- 
self. We enjoyed the trip over 
and then, having disembarked, 
decided to stroll along the har- 
borside promenade to Marine 
Land. Most of you will know 
what it is like — Marine Land, I 
mean — but just in case some- 
body hasn’t been there I’ll give 
a brief description of it. It’s a 
huge, cylindrical tank, with ports 
<rf heavy glass in its sides. From 
the levels surrounding it you can 
look in at the inmates, while the 
inmates look out at you. There 
are the inevitable sharks and 
rays; ther o are one or two mossy- 
backed turtles; there are hordes 
of smaller fishes, all of them 
swimming round and round and 
round — for most of the time. As 
advertised, there are the merman 
and the mermaid. 

The merman, an athletic young 
man in aqualung and black, skin- 
tight suit, was spending most of 
the time tinkering with the 
plumbing at the bottom of the 
tank. What exactly he was doing 
we never found out, but there 
162 



were metal pipes down there in 
the sand, and there were joints 
in them, and he, with a Stilson 
wrench, was either tightening 
these or slacking them off. The 
fish ignored him. 

The mermaid, an attractive girl 
similarly attired, was not ignored. 
She had brought a metal tucker 
box with her, and it was obvious 
that one and all knew what was 
in the box — and obvious, too, 
that the small fry knew that they 
weren’t in the running. Her spe- 
cial p>ets seemed to be a largish 
shark, an evil-looking black ray, 
and one of the turtles. These 
fawned around her, more like 
persistent cats or dogs than the 
cold-blooded creatures that they 
were. The way that the ray was 
carrying on, as she took morsels 
of food from the box and put 
them into its mouth, reminded 
all three of us of the more lurid 
magazine covers. You know the 
sort of thing — beautiful Earth 
girl on the point of being raped 
by some alien monster. All of us 
had, from time to time, sneered 
at those covers — now it almost 
seemed that there might be some- 
thing in them after all. 

All the same, it was fantastic, 
and I said so. Those beasts — 
two fishes and one reptile — 
were behaving in a manner more 
typical of mammals than of their 
own species. I could see, I said, 
how a close bond of affection 

GALAXY 




could develop between a human 
being and a porpoise — but be- 
tween a girl and a sting ray it 
seemed neither right nor possi- 
ble ... 

“Everything is possible,” sud- 
denly said the little man who 
had been peering through the 
port next to ours. “/ know.” 

We all turned to look at him. 
He was, as I have said, a little 
man — at first glance a very or- 
dinary little man, casually at- 
tired in slacks and open-necked 
shirt, with brown shoes that had 
been polished last at least four 
days ago. His face was wrinkled 
and sun-tanned; his scanty, sandy 
hair had been brushed to cover a 
large bald spot, and his eyes were 
a faded blue. A fisherman, I 
thought. Professional or semi- 
professional. 

“I know,” he repeated, with a 
change of emphasis. 

It is always rather embarrass- 
ing when complete strangers 
break into a private conversation, 
and this man who had assured us 
that he knew (about what?) also 
knew how we were feeling. He 
went on rather hastily, “I heard 
you talking. You’re writers, aren’t 
you?” 

We admitted it. 

“Then I can talk to you,” he 
said. “At least, I hope I can. I 
have to tell my story to some- 
body. I told it to the cops, and 
to their headshrinker and to quite 
WHEN I WAS IN THE ZOO 



a few more quacks in the sarne 
line of business. But they didn’t 
believe it. They wouldn’t believe 
it. After aU, I’d been adrift in my 
dinghy for days, and it had turn- 
ed my mind. It didn’t occur to 
them that I should’a been at least 
half dead of hunger and thirst 
. ” He looked back into the 
tank, where the girl was now 
feeding the turtle. “That’s why 
I come here, you know. So I can 
see for myself that such things 
do happen. So that I can be sure 
that it wasn’t all in my imagina- 
tion.” 

Edward and Nola Edwards 
looked at me, and I looked at 
themf Something very close to 
telepathy was established among 
the three of us. The man 
was a nut, we were thinking. But 
now and again nuts have stories 
to tell — and stories, after all, 
were our bread and butter. 

“Isn’t there a . pub near 
here?” Edwards asked me. 

“More than one,” I told him. 

“Then I suggest that we . 
ah . adjourn for some refresh- 
ment.” He turned to the little 
man. “And will you join us, sir?” 

He said that he would. 

TT^e were a little surprised 
^ * when the stranger — Clar- 
ry Simpson was his name — - in- 
sisted on paying for the first 
round. And then, as we sat 
around the table, our cold beer 

183 




before us, he started to talk. 
There are compulsive drinkers, 
and there are compulsive talkers. 
He came in the latter category. 

I have to tell this story, he 
said. I have to tell it, and I hate 
myself for doing ^t, ’cause I know 
that every time I do they’re say- 
ing, “Clary’s off again. Been prop- 
er round the bend ever since he 
lost that Sue of his.” Sue? you 
ask. No. Not a wife nor a girl 
friend. Just my boat — and a 
better friend to me nor any wom- 
an could’ve been. My apologies 
to you, lady.” 

Yair . Sue. We were on our 
way back from up the coast, 
Norah Head way. We were well 
outside, well outa the way o’ 
those blasted colliers an’ the like. 
Just meself there was; I was never 
one to be bothered wi’ crew. Just 
meself, an’ Sue’s diesel chuffin’ 
away hapjMly. Hardly any wind, 
an’ a sky full o’ stars, an’ the 
loom o’ Macquarie light bright 
on the starboard bow an’ the 
glare o’ the city lights fillin’ the 
sky beyond that. 

Not a care in the world I had. 
A good catch — even dnglehand- 
ed you can manage quite well 
once you’ve got the hang of it — 
that’d fetch a good price along- 
side. More’n enough to pay all 
expenses wi’ enough left over for 
coupla nights out. Can’t say that 
I was pa3rin’ much attention to 
an3Tthing. As I always uster say, 
T84 



Sue could find her own way home 
without me botherin’ her. 

Then I heard it. 

Like a big electric motor it was. 
Didn’t pay much attention at 
first — there’s so many fancy 
flyin’ machines an’ the like these 
days, an’ the Air Force is always 
out playin’ silly buggers round 
the coast at night. But I did look 
up, after a bit. Couldn’t see any 
navigation lights, but that made 
sense. The R.A.AJ. out on exer- 
cises doesn’t show any. There 
was somethin’ there, though. I 
saw it, blottin’ out the stars. An’ 
I got scared. It was too flamin’ 
big, and too flamin’ slow. I’ve 
seen helicopters, an’ this wasn’t 
one. There was far too much of 
it, an’ it didn’t sound right. 

I opened her up — Sue, I mean 
— an’ damn the fuel consiunp- 
tion. (She was an extravagant lit- 
tle witch at an3Tthing like full 
speed.) I opened her up — an’ 
for all the good it did I might 
just as well ha’ stopped her, there 
and then. That fl3dn’ thing was 
directly over me an’ it stayed 
there, an’ I could feel some sort 
o’ force pushin’ down on me. It 
was more than just feelin’ it. I 
could see that the water around 
the boat was shoved down in 
a sorta depression. It was like 
bein’ in the middle erf a big, deep 
saucer. 

Then the searchlight dazzled 
me. It was so bright, so blinding 

GALAXY 




that I didn’t realize that Sue and 
i had been lifted clear o’ the 
water — though I realized it soon 
enough when her engine started 
to race. By the time I had her 
stopped I’d just time ter see that 
we were bein’ pulled up through 
some sort o’ round hatch. No, 
there weren’t any winches or ca- 
bles. Musta been magnetism or 
somethin’ like it. 

So there we were, Sue and I, 
shut up in a big, steel box like 
the hold of a ship. There were 
lights, but I couldn’t see much 
by them; they were a funny sort 
o’ blue an’ very dim. But there 
was a three-cell torch in a clip 
in the wheelhouse, an’ I used that 
to see what was what. 

It was like bein’ in a ship’s 
hold, like I said. But there wasn’t 
any way out. No ladders, no es- 
cape hatches, nothin’. An’ I 
couldn’t see any way o’ openin’ 
that hatch at the bottom that 
we’d been pulled up through. Just 
as well, perhaps, though I wasn’t 
ter know that by this time we 
were miles up an’ stiU climbing. 
Oh, yes, I could hear machinery, 
a whinin’ sort o’ noise, but it 
didn’t make no sense ter me. 

There was a hissin’ sound, too, 
an’ that didn’t make no sense 
neither, not until I got a whiff o’ 
the gas that they were pumpin’ 
in — like a mixture o’ garlic an’ 
talcum powder it was — an’ 
passed out. 

WHEN I WAS IN THE ZOO 



A fter Edwards had bought a 
fresh round of drinks he went 
on. 

When I woke up, he said, I 
wasn’t in Sue’s wheelhouse. I 
wasn’t in that ship’s hold. I 
thought at first that I was out in 
the bush. I was lyin’ on rou^, 
sandy ground. I could feel it 
without lookin’ at it; somebody’d 
taken me shirt an’ me strides an’ 
even me jockey pants. It wasn’t 
cold, luckily, an’ it wasn’t too 
hot. But it made me fed . 
naked. Damn it all, I was naked. 
An’ I could tell that I was bein’ 
watched. 

I opened me eyes — and there 
was another pair o’ eyes lookin’ 
into mine. Cat’s eyes. “Puss,” I 
said. “Nice puss.” I opened me 
eyes properly. It was a cat all 
right, but a big one. Too bleedin’ 
big. Bengal tigers is aU right when 
they’re on one side o’ the bars 
an’ you’re on the other, but when 
you’re in the same bleedin’ cage 
it ain’t no bleedin’ joke. I let out 
a yell you coulda heard from here 
to the black stump an’ I was on 
me feet an’ startin’ to run — but 
I couldn’t run. That was the 
worst part of it. I could only 
shuffle over that sandy ground, 
an’ I could hear that blasted tiger 
shufflin’ an’ snifflin’ behind me, 
an’ all the time I was expectin’ to 
feel his claws in me back. 

An’ then — how shall I put it 
— my fear sorta wore off. There 

185 




was the feelin’ that I had ter get 
some exercise walkin’ around and 
walkin’ around, an’ everybody an’ 
everything else in the big, trans- 
parent dome mi^ta had the same 
feelin’. An’ there all of us were 
— lions, an’ tigers, an’ a smallish 
elephant, an’ a pair o’ giraffes, 
an’ — you name it, they had it. 
There was a sheila too, a black 
wench, as naked as I was, an’ I 
was able ter catch up wi’ her, but 
she didn’t have no English an’ 
seemed more scared o’ me than 
she was o’ the animals. It’s a 
blow to yer pride, I tell yer, when 
a girl makes it plain that she’d 
sooner have the company o’ a 
dirty great gorilla than yours! 

So there we were, a regular 
Noah’s Ark, in this enormous 
glasshouse affair about the size 
o’ the Domain. There were trees, 
which looked fairly healthy, an’ 
some sizeable patches o’ grass, an’ 
rocks, an’ a shallow stream o’ 
fresh water, an’ bushes. But there 
wasn’t a proper sky overhead. 
You could see the ^een an’ shim- 
mer o’ the glass dome, an* beyond 
that what looked like plumbing. 
An’ out towards the sides there 
was glass again — or somethin’ 
Tike glass — an’ outside that 
again there was . people. No. 
Not men an’ women an’ children. 
Their shapes was always changin’. 
Like big jellyfishes walkin’ on 
their hind legs — if jellyfishes 
had hind legs, which they don’t. 
186 



But those did, an’ arms of a sort, 
an’ they were usin’ ’em to point 
with. 

Sorta lost count o’ time, I did. 
Hadn’t got my watch no longer, 
o’ course. But every few hours the 
lights’d go out an’ we’d sleep. Be- 
lieve it or not, I got quite pally 
with that tiger an’ I think he 
quite liked me. Like turnin’ in 
with a big dog or cat on your bed, 
it was. Not that there was any 
bed — just the softest patch o’ 
grass I could find. For drink there 
was the stream. At feedin’ times 
the right sort o’ tucker for every- 
body’d come droppin’ down from 
up top somewhere. My friend 
Puss — 1 called him that — use- 
ter get some kdiMl o’ raw meat, 
an’ rd get a loaf o’ bread an’ a 
tin o’ sardines. They musta check- 
ed up on what was in the locker 
in Sue's wheelhouse. 

Every now an’ again there’d be 
a new animal. The rhinoceros I 
remember — it looked at 'first as 
though the gas or the ray or 
whatever it was that they were 
usin’ to keep us from flyin’ at 
each other’s throats wasn’t goin’ 
ter work. But before he did any 
damage he was as tame as file 
rest of us. An’ there was a couple 
o’ dirty great bears, an’ some o’ 
those little black an’ white ones, 
an’ a hippopotamus. They widen- 
ed an’ deepened part of the 
stream for him during a sleeping 
period. 



GALAXY 




But the animals . I’d seen 
’em all in the Zoo or in pictures 
in books or in films. It was the 
people — I’ll call ’em that — 
who had me puzzled. I’d got the 
idea, somehow, that this was a 
big flying saucer that we were in, 
and that smaller ones had been 
coming down to Elarth to collect 
. , . specimens. Yair. That’s all 
we were. An’ these people in the 
saucer weren’t little green men 
from Mars or beautiful blondes 
from Saturn. They were . dif- 
ferent. They were different, an’ 
they were kiddin’ themselves 
that they were as far above us as 
we’re above dogs an’ cats. 

Perhaps they were, in some 
ways. But not in all. 

A nyhow, one day a couple o’ 
them came down into the 
dome with us. Like the man an’ 
the girl in the tank they were 
wearing suits. Perhaps our air was 
different from theirs. Perhaps the 
suits were armor just in case any 
o’ us was too handy with teeth 
or claws. 

But the suits made them look 
more like people. A head, two 
arms, two legs, an’ the sight o’ 
transparent innards churnin’ 
away decently hidden by stiff, 
white cloth. One o’ them was car- 
ryin’ a bag of odd-lookin’ tools 
an’, after he’d scraped the sand 
away from a manhole cover, 
started to fiddle around with a 
WHEN I WAS IN THE ZOO 



worm’s nest of pipes an’ wires 
that was under it. Needless ter 
say, I was interested. But every 
time that I got within four feet 
of him it was like gettin’ an elec- 
tric shock. After half a dozen 
tries — the last shock nearly flat- 
tened me — I decided to leave 
him alone. 

The one in the other suit wasn’t 
a “him" — it was a “her.” Don’t 
ask me how I knew, I just felt it. 
She was carrying a box. She 
squatted down under one o’ the 
bushes an’ opened the lid just a 
little. An’ she . whistled. I don’t 
know to this day if she was really 
whistling, or if she was just mak- 
in’ the noise of it happen inside 
the brains of some of us. 

But Puss heard it, an’ that 
dirty gorilla heard it, an’ the 
rhinoceros heard it. An’ I heard 
it. So there were the four of us 
— the tiger, the gorilla, the rhino 
and the man — all of us running 
to where that . that girl was 
sitting under the tree. The smell 
that was cornin’ out of her tucker 
box was really something. You’d 
never appreciate it unless you’d 
been on a steady diet of dry 
bread and sardines. It was steak 
an’ fryin’ onions, rare steak at 
that, with a hint of grilled toma- 
toes. 

Puss was all over her like a big 
house oat, until the gorilla man- 
aged to elbow him aside. (I won- 
der what they were smelling?) 

187 




The liiino, not too roughly, man- 
aged to shove them away, and 
Ihere was I, trying to get past 
that fledi-and-blood armored 
tank. I could see that she was 
giving them something out of the 
box. It seemed to satisfy them — 
and then it was my turn. 

Her hand — yes, she had a 
hand — stretched out an’ p>opped 
something into my open mouth. 
Yes, it was steak all right, just 
the way I like it done, an’ so 
tender that it hardly required 
chewing. Yet that one little 
mouthful seemed to be lastin’ an’ 
lastin’. While I was eating I look- 
ed at her. Was I seein’ her the 
way that I wanted to see her, or 
the way that she wanted me to 
see her? Somethin’ of both, I 
guess. But she was a blonde, nice- 
ly tanned, an’ she was wearin’ one 
o’ those bikinis that make a wom- 
an look more undressed than 
when she hasn’t a stitch on, an’ 
she had all the right things in the 
right places, an’ her wide, red 
mouth was smilin’ at me. 

I swallowed what was left in 
me own mouth an’ reached out 
for her. She came inter my arms 
willin’ly enough, or so it seemed, 
but it wasn’t much of a kiss. It 
didn’t last long enough. In no 
time at all she was pushin’ me 
away, an’ I could see why. That 
cobber of hers, the one who’d 
done the repair or maintenance, 
was standin’ there glarin’ at us. 
188 



But he was only a . blob 
in a sort o’ skin-diving outfit, an’ 
she was a woman. Even though 
she was changin’ back, slowly, to 
the way ^e had been when she’d 
come inter the dome, she was still 
a woman. 

in^ell, that was the start of it. 

» ’ Every day — if they were 
days — the pair of them’d come 
inter the dome among the dan- 
gerous animals. He’d be playin’ 
around the plumbin’, an’ she’d be 
feedin’ her special pets. I don’t 
mind admittin’ that if I’d seen 
her as a purple octopus I’d a put 
up with her for the sake o’ that 
steak, although it wasn’t always 
steak. Now and again there’d be 
chicken — or somethin’ that tast- 
ed like chicken — or prawns, or 
crayfish. An’ there’d be little 
bulbs o’ some plastic that burst 
in the mouth an’ made you feel 
like you were gettin’ outside a 
schooner o’ good, cold beer. All 
that — an’ a shape better’n any- 
thing you’ll ever see at Manly 
or Bondi or even Surfers .... 

She must’a seen the way that 
I was startin’ to feel about her. 
In any case, I couldn’t hardly 
hide it. An’ those people outside 
the glass — it didn’t matter about 
them. They weren’t real people, 
you see. But she was, somehow. 
Every time that she put on her 
act — that we put on our act — 
it was costin’ me more an’ more 

GALAXY 




effort to keep me paws off her. 
It was gettia’ to be quite a strain, 
believe me. 

Then one night, when I was 
sleepin’, she came into the dome 
by herself. I woke up sudden like. 
There she was, standin’ there. 
There was just enough light for 
me to see that she was wearin’ 
a sort of transparent robe — al- 
though most o’ what light there 
was seemed to be cornin’ from her 
body. She was all woman — or 
she looked to be all woman, an’ 
what did it matter, anyhow? 

She said, “Come with me.” Her 
voice matched the rest of her. 

“So you can speak Ekiglish,” 
I said. 

“Of course,” she told me. “We 
have been monitming your radio 
programs for many years.” 

I was bloody annoyed then. 
“Then why do you treat me like 
a bloody animal?” I asked. 

“Because, my dear, that is all 
that you are. That is all that any 
of your people are ccanpared with 
Us.” Then she said, all sweetness, 
“But you’re a nice animal.” 

I should’a been ropeable. 
Where was me pride? I should’a 
been ropieable, but I wasn’t. How 
does a dog feel when his mistress 
is nice to him? How does the ray 
in that tank back there feel when 
the girl lets him sort o’ crawl all 
over her? There’s more to it than 
just cupboard love, I’m sure o’ 
that now. An’ we’ve all heard the 
WHEN I WAS IN THE ZOO 



stories, haven’t we, about men an’ 
women an’ the so-called lower 
animals .... 

So I followed her, through the 
dome, walkin’ aromd all the 
sleepin’ beasts. It reminded me, 
somehow, o’ the Garden of Eden. 
But there was the wench who 
should’a been my Eve, that black 
girl, cuddled up to that dirty 
great gorilla o’ hers an’ snorin’ 
her head off. She was too fat, 
anyhow. I wondered what I’d 
ever seen in her. 

We came to the wall of the 
dome. Suddenly there was a cir- 
cular opening in it. She walked 
through, then she turned and 
said, “Don’t worry. You’ll be all 
right without 'breathing apparatus 
for about two hours. Our air’s not 
exactly poisonous to you, al- 
though it should have quite a 
strong euphoric effect.” 

I asked her, “What’s that?” 

She said, “It will make you 
feel a little drunk.” 

Things, I thought, were getting 
better and better. I followed her 
along a sort of ship’s alleyway, 
and in one part of it there were 
big ports or windows, and there 
was light shining through, Ske 
moonlight, but bri^ter. I had ter 
look out, of course, an’ I rather 
wished I hadn’t. It’s cme tMng 
ter see the world from thousands 
of miles up in a film, an’ it’s an- 
other thing entirely ter really do 
it. But this aai of tiieirs was doin’ 

189 




things to me. That was the Earth 
down there. So what? I could 
hardly care less. 

She said, “We shall be moving 
on soon. We have almost a full set 
of specimens from your planet. 
By the time ^hat we arrive at 
Lala’au their training should be 
completed.” 

“Their training?” I asked. 

“Yes. Polardnor and I are the 
trainers attached to this expedi- 
tion. But come.” 

Again I followed her. Finally 
she led me into a cabin — and it 
would’a made a first-class suite 
in the Queen Mary look like an 
aboo’s humpy. Was it really like 
that? I don’t know. Probably it 
wasn’t — any more than she was 
really like the long-legged, lovely 
blonde that I was seeing. But 
there was a low table, an’ on it 
a big bottle of champagne in a 
silver ice bucket, an’ all sorts o’ 
good things to eat .... 

An’ there was a bed, as wide 
as a footie field. 

An’ there was her. 

T don’t know what you’ll think 
o’ me when I tell you what I 
did. I know what I think o’ my- 
self, But she’d told me that we 
had two hours before I’d ter get 
get back inter the dome, an’ there 
was that champagne, that I’d 
had (Mily once, years ago, at me 
sister’s wedding, an’ there was 
that caviar (I think it was) that 
190 



I’d never had at all. So we sat 
down, facing each other across 
the table, an’ I worried at the 
cork o’ the champagne bottle un- 
til it came out with a noise like 
somebody firin’ off a six-incK gun, 
an’ I poured the bubbly inter the 
two glasses. Oh, it was good, all 
right. Just like I remembered it, 
but better. 

An’ I never got around to tast- 
in’ that caviar. 

The cabin didn’t change — but 
the outlines of everything got 
sort of wavery, an’ you could al- 
most see through them. She didn’t 
change — but she was fading and 
frayed, like, round the edges. The 
two who’d come in were in their 
own natural forms, jelly-men 
with a pair of arms too many, 
just blobs where their heads 
should have been, all sorts of 
wriggling, brightly colored coils 
inside them. One of them, I knew, 
was her partner Polordnor. TKe 
other one was the captain. 

They weren’t saying ■ anything. 
Not out loud, that is. But they 
were thinkini. Telepathy’s the 
word for it, isn’t it? I could pick 
up her thoughts, but only a word 
or so of the others’. It was almost 
like listening to only one end of 
a telephone conversation. 

Bestiality. That was from Pol- 
ordnor. 

I have my methods. That was 
from her. They are always suc- 
cessful.

Then the thoughts were crack- 
lin’ around me like lightning 
bolts. I’ve had ter tangle with 
jealous boyfriends an’ husbands 
before — I still don’t know which 
this Polordnor was — but the 
jealousy in this case was more 
than . sexual. It was profess- 
ionaL And as for the sexual part 
of it — haven’t you often wonder- 
ed just what sort of relationship 
exists between lady animal tam- 
ers and their beasts? Maybe I’ve 
a dirty mind. And maybe I’m 
speakin’ from experience. 

Well, I was just sittin’ there, 
wonderin’ what was goin’ ter hap- 
pen ter me. Polordnor was want- 
in’ to have me shot at once, or 
somethin’ equivalent. The cap- 
tain, I sensed, was inclined to 
take her side. But it all seemed 
to be somethin’ like the system 
of command in a whale factory 
ship. You know. When she’s func- 
tionin’ as a factory the factory 
manager gives all the orders. 
When the whalin’ is finished, the 
Old Man takes comm^and again. 

Then she said to me, speaking 
this time, “You will not be harm- 
ed. We shall return you to where 
we found you.” 

What they used on me I don’t 
know. It could have been gas, it 
could have been some sort of ray. 
But I blacked out, and when I 
came to I was in the dinghy, 
bouncing up and down in a bas- 
tard of a swell, an’ with the lights 
WHEN I WAS IN THE ZOO 



of Sydney just a glow in the sky 
to the south’ard. What happened 
to Sue I don’t know. Could be 
that the engineers in that blasted 
flyin’ saucer took her apart ter 
see what made her tick. 

Almost got run down twice that 
night — or early morning, rather. 
Then it wasn’t too bad. The first 
ship along — Dutch, she was — 
spotted me an’ picked me up. An’ 
they were decent enough, too, to 
break out one o’ their cranes to 
hoist my dinghy aboard. Just as 
well, that was. Although it was 
just as well, too, that nobody 
found that ingot of gold hidden 
under the bottom boards. Almost 
never found it m3rself. Then it 
was a helluva worry flogging it 
without losing too much on the 
deal. 

And there was somethin’ else I 
found — althou^ it had faded 
by the time that I was picked up. 
It was like a tattoo, a Itiminous 
tattoo, on the skin o’ me belly. 
There was only one sentence. 

I shall be back, 

'T'here was a silence. I looked 
at Edward and Nola Ed- 
wards. They looked at me. None 
of us wanted to look at the little 
man, but he looked at us. 

“Well?” he demanded angrily. 
“Well?” 

“It’s . It’s a good story,” I 
said. 

“Do you believe it?” 



191 




Again we looked at each other. 
Professional writers are apt to 
take a very dim view of outsiders 
who actually see flying saucers 
and make contact with their 
crews. And, even in this case, one 
of the crew had turned out to be 
a beautiful blonde after all, al- 
though not from Saturn. 

“Do you believe it?” 

"There’s a certain absence of 
definite proof,” I said at last. 

"I could” said the little man, 
"let you know where I disposed 
of that gold. But gettin’ ineself 
murdered isn’t my idea of fun. 
But — ” he was very bitter — 
“I thought that you people’d be- 



lieve me. But no. You’re as bad 
as all the other bastards — the 
cops and the head shrinkers.” 

“A very good day to you all.” 

And that was almost the end 
of it. 

The real end was — I suppose 
— a few da3Ts later, when I read 
in the morning paper that a 
search was being made in coastal 
waters for the missing Sue II, the 
owner and sole crew of which was 
a Mr. Clarence Simpson. 

At about the same time, too, 
there were one or two UFO sight- 
ings off the New South Wales 
coast.

2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY 

Reviewed by LESTER DEL REY 



■^Tobody slept at the New York 
^ press preview of 2001, but 
only because the raucous and sil- 
ly noise from -the sound track 
screamed painfully into our ears. 
Space was a tumult of din and 
the hero breathed in his space- 
suit like a monstrous locomotive 
at 60 gasps a minute. It was the 
only evidence of excitement in 
the place. Almost half of .the 
audience had left by intermission, 
and most of us who stayed did 
so from curiosity and to com- 
plete our reviews. 

The pictorial part was superb. 
The color photography was gen- 
erally excellent, and the special 
effects and technical tricks were 
the best ever done. Even the act- 
ing was unusually good. With' all 
that, Stanley Kubrick and Ar- 
thur C. Clarke should have giv- 
en us the superlative movie 
promised by a barrage of pub- 
licity. If they had put Clarke’s 
Earthlight on the screen with 
equal genius, it would have been 



a great science-fiction movie. Un- 
fortunately, they didn’t. Instead 
they gave us dullness and con- 
fusion. 

The whole affair dragged. Ev- 
ery trick had to be stretched in- 
terminably and then repeated 
over and over again. Nothing was 
explained or given coherent flow, 
but everything was run on to 
boredom. Further cutting might 
help; surely it couldn’t hurt. 

The story staggers through 
four vaguely related episodes. 
First we get the theme of man’s 
humanoid ancestors being given 
intelligence by an alien slab only 
to become murderers. Next we 
go to the moon to find future 
men have dug up the same slab 
— excellent background but no 
drama — and no reason for it be- 
ing there. Then we take a trip to 
Jupiter because — as we learn 
eventually — men think the slab 
came from there. 

This episode has a conflict be- 
tween men and an articulate 



193 




computer. It might Have been 
good, except for the lack of ra- 
tionality. No motivation is pro- 
vided for the computer’s going 
mad, and tHe Jiero acts like a 
fool. He knows the computer 
can’t be trusted, and we’ve seen 
that the computer can at least 
operate a rescue craft to bring 
back his dead friend. But he goes 
out himself, leaving his compan- 
ions in hibernation to be Idlled 
by tHe computer. 

Finally, we get an endless run 
of obvious and empty S3rmbols 
on tfie screen, followed by our 
Kero in a strange room. Appar- 
ently He’s undergone intergalac- 
tic transfer and now grows old 
and dies in tHe room, followed 
by a metapEysical S3m^bol at tKe 
end .THe alien contact we’ve been 
promised is no more than a brief 
shot of tfie slab again. 

Tf possible wait to see it for tfie 
effects until you can buy tfie 
soft cover book. Book and movie 



don’t entirely agree, but maybe 
the book will provide some re- 
lief to the confusion of tfie movie. 

THe real message, of course, is 
one Kubrick Has used before: in- 
telligence is perHaps evil and 
certainly useless. THe Humanoid 
reaction and pointless madness 
of tHe computer sKow tfiis. Men 
can only be saved by some vague 
and unsKown mystic experience 
by aliens. 

THis isn’t a normal science-fic- 
tion movie at all, you see. It’s tHe 
first of tfie New Wave-Tfiing mov- 
ies, witfi tfie usual empty S3nn- 
bolism. TKe New Tfiing advo- 
cates were exulting over it as a 
mind-blowing experience. It takes 
very little to blow some minds. 
But for the rest of us, it’s a dis- 
aster. 

It will probably be a box-of- 
fice disaster, too, and tfius set 
major science-fiction movie mak- 
ing back another ten years. 

It’s a great pity.
