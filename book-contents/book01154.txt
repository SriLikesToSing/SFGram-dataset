Not even at a Worldcon would you get that 
wide a range of personalities (though 
Noreascon came close) . But the Beagle list 
has brought it off. To our booming Love- 
craft program we are adding the works of 
P. G. Wodehouse, starting with three of his 
classic novels, Leave It to Psmith, The 
Small Bachelor, and Brinkley Manor 
—that last is a great Jeeves story. This is 
P. G. Wodehouse’s 90th birthday year, 
and he considers the Psmith novel (the P 
is silent, as in Ptarmigan) his favorite 
amongst his work, The Small Bachelor 
as technically about his best, and the 
Jeeves books as his favorite series. And if Wodehouse, after 70 years 
of writing, doesn’t know what’s good, who does?

W E CAME out of Ultraspan — 
and into the glowing grandeur 
of the Seven Suns. 

From Earth they didn’t look like 
much, a paltry cluster of bright 
pinpoints. They don’t loom large 
on galactic charts. But they had 
been a sort of serious hobby with 
Doug Frost for years. The mono- 
graph for which he is best known is 
a meticulous analysis of that 
inconspicuous little group. 

His speculations had included 
the high probability of planets 
around each star. The nature of 
the Seven Suns made life on some 
of those orbiting worlds a dis- 
tinct possibility. Or so ran Doug 
Frost’s hypotheses. And he was 
our Galileo, our Harlow Shap- 
ley. His thoughts are infinitely 
respectable. And he was why we 
were here, a hundred and thirty 
light-years from Sol III and from 
the research ship Stardust's home 
cradle at Tycho Base on Earth’s 
moon. This trip was for Doug 
Frost. For him the lure was to 



3 



study his friends at close range. For 
us the bait was possible life on 
those hypothetical planets. 

We’ve found life. The Stardust's 
count of worlds examined in- 
cludes several on which life 
abounded. We’ve found advanced 
forms and in a couple of instances 
sophisticated capacities and 
technologies. We’ve made friends 
with strange beings. We have seen 
a cultured world destroyed. But 
we’ve never found living things 
close to humanoid — and never any 
that approached space capacity. 

“Alert. All personnel, alert. 
Emergency drill. Personal space 
equipment. Take all precautions 
and stand by.” 

Stony Price, communications 
chief, rarely sounded completely 
serious, but he did then. Stony’s 
message was one of a series 
everyone knew, but I had only 
heard this one used once before. It 
was the Prepare To Abandon 
Ship alert. He repeated it after 
exactly one minute. Then the in- 
tercom went on automatic, re- 
peating “Alert — ” at brief inter- 
vals. 

We were in pattern after the Ul- 
traspan stage. It had been a big 
one — seventeen light-years — and 
it was the last. We were there. We 
had arrived. The pattern was wel- 
come, but I’m not sure I can ex- 
plain why. All I know is the great- 
er the stage distance, the more im- 
portant the pattern seems to be. 

“Saved by a meteor — or may- 



be a space dragon.” Pegleg Wil- 
liams stood up so slowly that you 
would have had to know him to re- 
alize that he had recognized and 
reacted before the message was 
half complete. “I’d have had you 
in two moves, Roscoe.” 

“A random statement — ” I be- 
gan, but Pegleg was at the door. 

“Leave the board,” he called. 



W E HAD been playing space 
chess in my lab, allowing our 
bodies to adjust from the painless, 
timeless rigors of a long stage to 
the different feels and stresses of a 
new sector of space. That sounds 
like Jabberwocky, but it is sim- 
ply stated fact. Theoretically 
an Ultraspan stage is accom- 
plished without time lapse. There 
is no genuine physical stress. You 
feel nothing, experience nothing. 
Fpr a timeless moment you sim- 
ply cease to be. Then, by the next 
tick of the chronometer, your sur- 
roundings are changed, different. 
A new arrangement of stars will 
show on the viewscreens. And the 
feel of the space is alien. 

Pegleg’s nearest emergency 
space gear was in his own lab. I 
brought out mine from its special 
locker, checked each item against 
my master list, slipped into the 
space suit. It took perhaps thirty 
seconds. It was the most prac- 
ticed routine aboard the Stardust. 
Dr. Johannes Rasmussen’s fa- 
vorite motto is Be prepared. Back

in the twentieth century he would 
undoubtedly have been a boy 
scout. 

My helmet under one arm, 
maintenance pack and propul- 
sion unit slung over a shoulder, I 
headed for the control room. I 
beat Pegleg by the twenty seconds 
it had taken him to get to his lab. 
The others were there. 

In the unlikely event that John- 
ny Rasmussen became unable 
to command the starship Stardust 
there were four of us who could fill 
the gap. The control room was our 
station in emergency. 

“Dr. Kissinger. Dr. Williams.” 

If we hadn’t known an emergen- 
cy existed, we would never have 
learned it from Johnny’s tone of 
voice. Tall, slender, perfectly 
groomed, his tanned face newly 
shaved, his mustaches waxed to 
points, he might have just invited 
us in for a spot of tea. 

“What gives, Johnny?” I asked. 
Pegleg was puffing from his fly- 
ing trip through the corridors. His 
trick leg slows him up. 

“Perhaps nothing to justify a 
general alert,” Johnny said. “On 
the other hand, we’ve survived by 
not taking chances. The matter 
sensors have detected an object.” 

“Must be some object,” grunted 
Pegleg. “I had Roscoe right 
where I wanted him in that chess 
game.” 

“That’s something that can be 
checked out,” I said. “Unless 
Cap’n Jules louses up the gravity 



those pieces will still be on the 
board when we get back. 

“I’ll try not to jar them,” Cap- 
tain Jules said dryly. “I can see 
that they’re pretty important.” 

I almost felt like leading a cheer 
for Captain Jules Griffin. The 
comment was the closest ap- 
proach to a witticism I had ever 
heard from him. Stolid, pedan- 
tic, just plain dull, Jules was none- 
theless the genius who under- 
stood and exercised uncanny 
control over the mighty timo- 
nium engines that moved the Star- 
dust in finite space. And he was 
one of the few men alive who could 
implement Ultraspan. But he 
had no small talk, no social 
graces. He said what he thought in 
briefest form. Mostly he kept si- 
lent. 

“Take a look, Roscoe.” 

Moe Cheng sat before his navi- 
gator’s viewscreen — small, incon- 
spicuous in his huge chair. Prob- 
ably no living being has ever 
known as much about the galaxy 
as this big-nosed, slant-eyed little 
man. 

P EGLEG and I gathered around. 

The “object” was clear on the 
screen — and the reason for the 
alert was plain. An alien spaceship 
plowed steadily along, glinting in 
the yellow light of the nearest of 
the Seven Suns. I say that posi- 
tively. There was no mistaking 
what it was. We had known that it 
would happen some time, but to

come out of Ultraspan practi- 
cally in its path must have been a 
little disconcerting to Captain 
Jules and to Moe Cheng. 

“You’ve taken your time,” 1 
observed. “That thing is close.” 

“Five thousand miles,” Moe 
Cheng said. “It has been closer. 
We sheered off and turtled up as 
soon as we detected it after the 
stage.” 

“Did it react?” 

“No response of any kind. Our 
sudden appearance may have 
been unbelievable to its crew. 
Our disappearance more so. 
We’ve been studying it for thirty 
minutes and it hasn’t changed 
course or speed. Ten thousand 
miles an hour, following its 
nose.” 

“Primitive, I gather,” Pegleg 
said. “You don’t get the impres- 
sion of cruising. I’d say it’s going 
all out.” 

Cheng nodded slowly. 

“Ion drive. A complex exhaust. 
A lot of its mass would have to be 
fuel. It is unlikely that it’s any- 
thing more than an interplane- 
tary craft. We guess it hasn’t the 
capacity for interstellar space." 

“That means^ ■ 

“Correct,” Johnny Rasmussen 
said. “Planets in the neighbor- 
hood. Dr. Frost is investigating. 
But the spaceship is heading into 
the system, toward what we be- 
lieve to be its sun. Hence its home 
world would be farther out, at a 
cooler, more agreeable distance 



from the primary. Heat radia- 
tion here is pretty intense. A plan- 
et in our present location would 
be tolerable to life as we know it, 
but hot. Much would depend on its 
mass, atmosphere and so on. The 
spaceship may be exploring, pi- 
oneering. Opinion Roscoe?” 

“On short notice what you’ve 
said sounds reasonable,” I 
agreed. 

“If we’re turtled up and pre- 
sumably undetected — why the 

alert?” Pegleg inquired. 

Rasmussen leaned back in his 
chair and his teeth showed briefly. 

“Two reasons. Dr. Williams. 
One is that word ‘presumably.’ 
We can’t be sure we’re unde- 
tected. They — whatever they 
are — may simply be trying to fig- 
ure us out, watching while not 
seeming to watch. Who knows 
what detection and analytical 
potential they may have?” 

“Makes sense.” Pegleg nodded. 
He piled his helmet and space ac- 
cessories onto a chair and flexed 
his arms. “Stuff’s heavy,” he 
grumbled. “How about reason 
number two?” 

“Mr. Cheng has another hy- 
pothesis,” Rasmussen said. “He 
postulates that the ship, still un- 
der drive as it is, may be out of con- 
trol. Its crew may be dead or may 
have abandoned ship for some un- 
known reason. In effect, we may 
have a derelict.” 

“It has made not the slightest 
adjustment,” Moe Cheng said.

“So?” 

“So we’re thinking of investi- 
gating. If we’re wrong — and they 
have us in view — boarding could 
be tricky. Hence — all personnel 
should be alert, ready and stand- 
ing by, as ordered.” 

I might explain what we meant 
by “turtling up.” The Stardust 
had the capacity to scramble, to 
reflect and refract not only light 
but other radiation that would 
reveal it in such a fashion that we 
became, in effect, invisible. Be- 
hind this screen a forcefield en- 
closed the ship in an almost im- 
penetrable envelope. The tur- 
tle was inside his shell. In terms of 
applied energies as' we could en- 
vision them the Stardust was both 
undetectable and impervious 
to attack. But with an alien tech- 
nology, who could be sure? As 
I’ve said many times before, 
Johnny Rasmussen left nothing 
to chance. That is why, when in the 
far future galactic history has 
piled up, the Stardust will still be 
legend. 

W E STUDIED the craft for a 
few minutes on Moe Cheng’s 
screen. As Pegleg had said, it was 
probably primitive. It looked 
like a flying spearhead, its bow a 
glinting point, its stern deeply di- 
vided with a cleft that gave it two 
long trailing sections to the rear. 
A row of round viewports ex- 
tended the length of the ship. I 
counted twenty-one on the side in 



view. And up near the point of the 
bow a flattened blister, like a pi- 
lot’s cabin, broke the metallic 
surface. An empty pilot’s cabin. 
At least, nothing showed in it. 

“I would almost guess,” Pegleg 
mused, “that that thing is a modi- 
fication of an atmospheric de- 
sign. It may even be navigable in 
the atmosphere of its planet of 
origin.” 

Cheng nodded approvingly. 

“Dr. Rasmussen has suggested 
the same thing. It gives weight to 
my idea that it would not be too 
risky to approach and investi- 
gate. The beings who built that 
ship are relatively new to space.” 

“Scoutboat?” I asked. 

“Right. Interested?” 

I grinned and turned to the chief. 

“Proposal, Johnny. I take a 
scoutboat, young Pete Watts as 
pilot, you to supply a language 
expert and Captain Jules to dele- 
gate us an engineer. We circle, 
probe and, if we get no response, 
approach the spaceship. If still no 
reaction, we put a man out to ex- 
plore the skin, look in the view- 
ports and try to see how the entry 
ports are designed. How does that 
grab you?” 

“And who will that man be, I 
wonder?” Pegleg jeered. “You’re 
trying to rig it so I’ll never prove 
that I’ve got you dead to rights on 
that chess board.” 

“Strike the language expert,” I 
said. “Pegleg wants to go. No 
doubt there’s something out there

GALAXY 




that’s right down a geologist’s al- 
ley.” 

“Fortunately,” Pegleg said 
smugly, “I have competence in 
many Helds.” 

“Including conversation,” I 
agreed. 

If all this sounds like little boys 
wrangling over a game of mar- 
bles, think nothing of it. It’s sim- 
ply the way we function. Behind 
that smokescreen good minds are 
operating. We know what we’re 
doing. The ever-growing series 
of volumes of The Log Of The 
Stardust is a big segment in the 
broad base of the history of space 
exploration. 

There are a lot of good names in 
those weighty tomes and every one 
represents a master scientist, a 
top specialist in his (or her) 
field — and because of our galac- 
tic experience we are all unique. 
There are none like us anywhere. 
There will be — but not yet. There’s 
one name among ours whose own- 
er stands out as different even 
aboard so unique an entity as the 
Stardust’s one-of-a-kind human 
components make her. Ursula 
Potts is a painter, mystic and, 
some have insisted, a genuine 
card-carrying witch. But her 
painted analyses have status with 
the most profound reports the 
rest of us have written. She some- 
times sees things no one else sees. 
That she’s weird has nothing to do 
with it. 

And now as we looked at the 



spacecraft on Moe Cheng’s 
screen, I felt sure that Ursula’s 
magic brushes were already put- 
ting it on canvas — and with a dif- 
ference that makes Ursula for- 
ever an original. 

I turned to Rasmussen. 

“Ursula?” I asked. “Does she 
know, Johnny?” 

“She had it almost before we 
did,” the chief admitted. “One of 
these years I’m going to learn how 
she does it.” 

“Don’t depend on it.” I punched 
a button on the intercom con- 
sole. 

“Well?” A thin, sharp, old, im- 
patient voice. 

“Roscoe, Ursula. What do you 
think?” 

“Artifact, Roscoe. No life.” 

“You think it was launched 
without a crew? With a pilot’s 
blister and all those ports?” 

“Didn’t say that. No life now. 
Doesn’t feel alive.” 

“With that assurance I think I’ll 
go out and have a look. If you say 
so, it's probably safe. I can de- 
pend on you, Ursula.” 

“Soft soap.” 

Ursula’s light went out, but I 
knew she was pleased. Every man 
in the control room, even Captain 
Jules, was grinning. 

“While I’m at it,” Rasmussen 
said, “I’d like to know how you do 
that.” 

“The same characteristic that 
makes Ursula function. I’m sheer 
genius. Do we go?”

“You go,” the chief said. “Set it 
up.” 

II 



T HE scoutboat eased gently 
from her pressure-sealed slip 
and the port closed behind her. At 
my direction the pilot swung in a 
ten-mile ellipse around the 
Stardust while we oriented. If the 
eye could be believed we were 
completely isolated and alone in 
the emptiness of space in a cigar- 
like forty-foot gondola, a slim, 
metallic and featureless sliver 
glinting in the intense rays of the 
yellow sun. The Stardust had van- 
ished. We knew it was there and I 
marveled once again at the effi- 
ciency of the light camouflage. 

Visible only at high magnifica- 
tion, but clear and definite on our 
space radar, the alien ship cruised 
on at her unvarying pace. Her di- 
rection had not altered a frac- 
tion. She seemed, as Ursula had 
said, lifeless. 

“Veer off and circle at a thou- 
sand miles, Pete. We’ll spiral in on 
her and watch her every second. I 
don’t think she’s playing pos- 
sum — but that’s how people find 
out what the next life is like. I’m 
pretty fond of this one, so stay on 
it, Gino.’’ The last was to the 
young engineer assigned us by 
Captain Jules. Actually he had 
won the draw. Every engineer had 
been fighting to come. 



“Roger, Dr. Kissinger. I like this 
incarnation pretty well myself.” 
The boy’s teeth gleamed in a 
swarthy face. 

We rarely work with scoutboats 
in deep space. They’re not de- 
signed for it and the need to use 
them comes almost never. 
They’re handy little explorer 
craft, four-man capacity and 
adaptable to the use of any of our 
many specialists. They make us 
mobile in atmosphere when a 
planet is being analyzed. 

But this was a different, a tricky 
situation, one we had never 
faced before, and we didn't dare 
risk the mother ship. The scout- 
boat was spaceworthy. It could do 
the job. 

We flashed toward the alien, hit 
the thousand-mile point and 
veered. No reaction of any sort. 
Pete worked us in in a series of 
sweeps at thirty thousand miles an 
hour. From her point of vantage 
the Stardust must have seen us as a 
minnow streaking through a cur- 
rent. As we closed in we zig- 
zagged, swung high above the 
spearhead and steadied, matching 
its pace. I could see into the pi- 
lot’s blister with binoculars. It 
was empty. 

“Okay, boys, here goes nothing. 
Take her alongside, Pete.” 

During the entire approach Peg- 
leg hadn’t said a word. Now he 
tightened his helmet into place, 
activated his microphone. 

“Technically you’re running this

show, Roscoe, so I can only sug- 
gest. If they don’t blast us — and I 
don’t think they will — let me make 
the space walk. You have a wife.” 
“Lindy will be touched.” I was 
dogging my own helmet. “You 
boys be sure to tell her of Dr. Wil- 
liams’ concern, if it comes to that. 
I think the space walk is a two-man 
job. Why don’t we both go, Peg- 
leg?” 

I imagine Pegleg’s surprise was 
minimal. He knew as well as 1 did 
what the MO would be. We’ve 
worked together so much we can 
read each other’s minds. As a gal- 
actic ecologist 1 often manage 
to land in some pretty hairy situa- 
tions. And there have been times 
when it was a mighty comforta- 
ble feeling to know that 1 was be- 
ing backed up by one of the or- 
neriest, most cantankerous, 
most completely dependable char- 
acters in space. 

T HE scoutboat lay practically 
alongside the alien, which was 
loafing along a hundred feet away. 
Nothing stirred. By now I was con- 
vinced that nothing would. We 
studied it curiously. 

It was interesting, but not 
overwhelming. Perhaps two hun- 
dred feet long, it had more depth 
than had appeared at distance. Its 
row of ports peered at us like blind 
eyes and sunlight glinted along its 
otherwise unbroken metallic 
sides. Or at least they seemed un- 
broken. 



“Keep us in view, boys,” I in- 
structed. “If our communica- 
tion quits, pick us up. Notify the 
Stardust we’re going out.” 

I went through the first lock in- 
to the tiny decompression cubi- 
cle, checked out my equipment, 
signaled Gino and launched my- 
self into the glittering cold of 
space. 

I had done this before. But al- 
ways in orbit, always with the 
bulk of a planet looming, even 
though thousands of miles away. 
Here we had nothing but the sil- 
very sliver of the scoutboat and, 
as I tumbled and rolled and ad- 
justed, the glinting blind-eyed bulk 
of the alien spaceship. 

I activated my propulsion unit, 
jetted gingerly away from the 
scoutboat. In a few minutes it 
seemed to give birth to the helmet- 
ed, white-clad monstrosity that 
was Pegleg. He adjusted, activated 
his jet and we eased across to the 
spaceship. 

Having been launched into space 
at the speed of the ship, to change 
our relative positions required 
only gentle jetting. I tossed out a 
magnetic grapple and was 
pleased to feel how strongly it 
clung to the pitted skin of the alien. 
Pegleg anchored himself a few 
yards toward the stern. We began 
to creep over the hull, using two 
grapples, pulling ourselves from 
place to place, examining the 
surface as we went. Nothing in- 
dicated that we were detected.

The soft vibration of the ship’s 
drive neither faltered nor changed. 

1 thumbed my microphone 
switch. 

“Kissinger to scoutboat. We’re 
grappled on. The drive is crude, 
but it hasn’t varied. We can feel 
the vibration. Can you see any- 
thing, Gino?” 

“We have you in view. Cameras 
are recording. Nothing new, Dr. 
Kissinger.” 

“Leave communication open,” 1 
directed. “I’ll be looking into the 
viewports. Dr. Williams will be 
trying to locate evidence of en- 
try ports.” 

“I think I’ve found one, Ros- 
coe,” Pegleg broke in. “Rectan- 
gular, about seven or eight feet 
high, four or five wide. Much good 
it’ll do us. It’s just a fine crease in 
the surface metal, probably 
overlapped and gasketed in a 
complicated fashion. How can 
we possibly activate it?” 

“Maybe they’ll let us in. Let me 
try the viewports. We’ll burn in if 
nobody’s home.” 

The viewports were virtually 
opaque from outside, but I could 
detect a dim glow. No movement. 
I released my grapples, jetted 
over the curve of the ship and re- 
grappled beside the clear mound 
of the pilot blister. And that, al- 
most certainly, was what it was. 
It was simple and different, but 
someone — or something — often 
sat there and operated that ship by 
direct view. I could plainly see the 



wide, apparently padded bench 
that was the seat of the pilot, fac- 
ing an unbelievable instrument 
panel. No dials, no needles, no 
lights. Just rows and rows of what 
looked like toggle switches — hun- 
dreds of them. I looked especial- 
ly for markings, for symbols, for 
any evidence of writing. Noth- 
ing. 

It occurred to me that this might 
be the place to burn in, but on sec- 
ond thought I rejected the idea. 
There would be no airlock here. If 
I broke the blister I might well 
bleed the ship. I realized that I 
was thinking in Earth terms, but 
the vessel had to be pressurized 
and it had to have an atmosphere 
of some sort. I jetted back to Peg- 
leg, who was still exploring. 

“Two entry ports, Roscoe.” Peg- 
leg’s voice was clear in my ear- 
plug. “Just outlines — but that’s 
what they are.” 

“We’ll assume a decompression 
chamber and a lock behind 
each,” 1 decided. “They may not 
be there, though. This is a relative- 
ly crude craft. I’ll grapple on and 
see if I can burn through. Stand off 
and cover me.” 

As I guessed, the thin laser 
beam from my hand gun sheared 
along the port outline as though it 
were cutting cheese. I had set it for 
very short range. I was betting we 
could operate the controls of the 
inner lock— if there were 
one — and I didn’t want to damage 
the chapiber.

¥ HAD cut along half the length 
* of one side when suddenly the 
port door collapsed inward. Or 
perhaps swung would be better. It 
was actually hinged, thus point- 
ing up the basic simplicity of the 
entire setup. The laser beam 
must have cut through the locking 
mechanism. My magnaflash 
showed a small metal-lined room, 
a heavy door on its inner side. We 
were lucking out. It was a cham- 
ber all right. 

I signaled Pegleg, then used the 
microphone. 

“No point in waiting,” I said. 
“Let’s go in. We can swing the 
door shut and it may serve while we 
activate the lock. There’s a con- 
trol panel.” 

“Roger.” Pegleg jetted across 
and followed me through the port. 
My magnaflash illuminated the 
bare little space with a light 
brighter than day. The door closed 
again readily, since no pressure 
hindered it. Pegleg leaned against 
it while I tried to figure the inner 
lock. 

There was little to figure. The 
door evidently was hinged, it ob- 
viously swung inward, but there 
was not a projection or a fixture 
on it. And the thing I had gener- 
ously called a control panel was 
actually a small plate with six 
small toggles beside the door. No 
symbols, no markings, no writ- 
ing of any kind. So I decided on a 
sequence and flipped the upper left 
one. I assumed a left-right, up-

down orientation since I had no 
basis for guessing any other pat- 
tern. And it worked. 

We could feel the pressure 
build. There was only a hairline 
crack where I had cut down the 
side of the outer door and while 
the room was losing air, it wasn’t 
losing much. The door actually 
seemed to reseal itself. In a short 
time the toggle flipped back. Ap- 
parently the pressure level had 
reached that of the ship. 

Again 1 had no basis for a 
choice, so I flipped the next toggle. 
For a moment nothing hap- 
pened. Then the lock door swung 
slowly aside and we looked into a 
large dim space cluttered with 
bales and bundles of unidentifi- 
able cargo. Cluttered is the word 
I want. The stuff was piled almost 
at random, though the larger 
bales, some as tall as I was, seemed 
to be stacked against the walls in 
some order. The magnaflash 
made the stuff visible, but other- 
wise didn’t help much. There were 
no markings on anything. 

There was, though, a six-toggle 
plate beside the pressure cham- 
ber door identical to the one on 
the other side. 1 flipped the sec- 
ond switch and the door swung 
smoothly into place again. 

I thumbed my microphone. 

“So far so good. If this is a 
mousetrap it has just caught a 
couple of mice.” I gave the mike 
full power. “Kissinger to scout- 
boat. Can you hear me, Gino?” 



14 



GALAXY 




The response was prompt and 
just a little fuzzy. “We’ve had you 
right along. Dr. Kissinger. Hull 
doesn’t seem to be shielded.” 

“Good. We’ve passed through 
the lock. No sign of life. Stay on us 
and notify the Stardust. We’re 
going exploring.” 

“Roger," the technician said 
cheerfully. “Luck.” 

The temptation was great to ex- 
amine everything minutely, but 
that could come later. That life I 
mentioned-- first priority was to 
check it out. I didn’t expect to find 
any. No crew, no survivors of any 
tragedy would have been so quiet, 
so inconspicuous. Although in 
our bulky white suits and gleam- 
ing helmets we might have looked 
pretty formidable to less com- 
plex life forms, even if they had 
progressed to space travel. Per- 
haps they were simply waiting to 
close the mousetrap for sure. 

I didn’t feel entirely cheerful 
as I activated another switch at 
the other end of the cargo space. 
A door silently admitted us to a 
long corridor, dimly lit by dully 
glowing ceiling spots and entire- 
ly empty. We marked our loca- 
tion and went cautiously for- 
ward, each with a laser gun at 
ready. Control was probably to- 
ward the front of the ship and 
there, if anywhere, we thought to 
find evidence of the apparently 
vanished crew. 

But nothing stirred. The metal 
floor vibrated gently with the 



steady pulse of the drive. The ship 
seemed organized around that 
central corridor and switch 
plates showed beside doors at ir- 
regular intervals along it. We 
activated a couple. The doors 
swung back to show space packed 
with packaged cargo. Everything 
seemed crude, simple, even unfin- 
ished. 

T HE third door we opened, far 
forward, produced the jackpot. 
The room was large and almost 
empty. We added the perfect light 
of magnaflashes to the dim glow 
of the ceiling spots and instantly 
swung our laser guns forward. 
A huge hairy beast lay sprawled on 
a great thick bedding pad almost 
in the center of the room. I forgot 
to breathe for a minute as we 
stood there, frozen. But the thing 
lay still and gradually we re- 
laxed. 

“It’s dead, Pegleg.” I probably 
sounded more hopeful than sure. 

“I wish no ill to any creature,” 
Pegleg said dryly, “but 1 think 
I'm just a little bit glad. What a 
varmint to take on a space voy- 
age.” 

I continued to study the dark, 
thick-armed, thick-legged mound 
on the bedding pad. 

“We have pets on the Star- 
dust ,” I observed. 

“Not grizzly-bear size we 
don’t.” 

“It has its own specially de- 
signed bed,” I said. “The room 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER

walls look like the others. It 
doesn’t seem to have been caged.” 

We advanced a few cautious 
steps and stood looking down at 
the creature. Its great head, long- 
snouted, was flung back and the 
open jaws showed even rows of yel- 
low tusks: the flesh-tearing teeth 
of a carnivore. The heavy legs end- 
ed in broad plantigrade feet and 
the four toes bore curved blunt 
claws. The hairy forepaws had 
amazingly long fingerlike digits. 
W'ith, I noted particularly, an op- 
posable thumb. One of those paws 
would have spanned a space three 
times the size of my hand. And I’ve 
got a hand like a Virginia ham. 

Pegleg’s reference to a grizzly 
was pretty apt. But make it a big 
grizzly. The body organization 
was remarkably Earthlike and 
that was a thing we had not found 
before in many contacts with gal- 
actic life. There was no reason for 
living things a hundred and thirty 
light-years distant to resemble- 
Earth life. But there was no reason 
for them not to either. 

I bent and lifted one of the out- 
flung forelimbs. It moved easily. 
No rigor mortis. 

“Not dead long,” 1 said. “Seems 
in good shape. Remind me to de- 
contaminate twice when I’m 
back aboard the scoutboat. This 
thing died of something that 
worked pretty fast.” 

“Let’s find what would keep pets 
like this.” 

But there was nothing else 



aboard the craft that could ever 
have been alive. 

We found a control room of 
sorts with a blank, striplike view- 
screen and the disconcerting tog- 
gle switches in banks on every wall. 
One door opened directly into 
the pilot blister above, an access 
reached by a broad ramp. There 
were no chairs, but thick pads lay 
on the floor before the toggle 
banks and the broad bench in the 
pilot blister was padded in the 
same fashion. I quit thinking like 
an Earthman and began to as- 
semble my data as a galactic 
spaceman should. And the an- 
swer was obvious. 

“What do you think, Pegleg?” 

I could see his quizzical look 
through the shielded plastic of his 
helmet. 

“I think we’ve found every- 
thing,” he said slowly, as though 
he were ashamed of having been 
so dense. “We’ve been looking for 
something that doesn’t exist and 
never has.” 

We generally come up with the 
answer at about the same time. 

“Right. Let’s look in on him 
again, then get out of here. The 
Stardust will have his origin pin- 
pointed by now. Captain Jules can 
put a crew of mechanics and tech- 
nicians aboard to figure out all 
those blasted toggles.” 

The situation still seemed unbe- 
lievable as we stood looking down 
again on the huge hairy form. But 
at the same time it made sense.

GALAXY 




“Captain, crew, navigator,” I 
said. “Maybe designer and build- 
er as well. Not as far along the 
technological trail as we, but 
potentially probably just as sharp.” 

“Granted,” Pegleg admitted. 
“But you may still have the privi- 
lege of notifying next of kin. If 
he were alive I don’t think I’d trust 
him?” 

“What else is new?” I retorted. 
“You don’t trust anybody. Why 
except him?” 

“Give a dog a bad name — ” Peg- 
leg mumbled. “Let’s get back to 
the scoutboat.” 

W E MAY never find another 
species that has achieved 
space travel. Probably some exist 
but, I’m beginning to suspect, not 
in the abundance that the theo- 
rizers, the probability experts 
and the storytellers would have 
you believe. Sure, it’s a big gal- 
axy. But the evidence is piling up 
that this crude flying ship was 
more of a red-letter deal than first 
appeared. So I’ve given it room in 
this account. It may turn out to be 
unique. 

In an hour we were back aboard 
the Stardust , reporting in per- 
son to Johnny Rasmussen. 

“A sort of galactic prairie 
schooner,” I summed it up, “but 
operated by a grizzly instead of a 
settler. Did you get a line on where 
he might have been going?” 

The chief nodded. 

“Dr. Frost has checked out the 



system. It is remarkably Sol- 
like, as I suspect most systems 
that have developed life will be. 
Remember Primrose, Cyrene, 
Mizar. This sun has four planets 
and three have atmospheres. It 
may well be the most life-rich sys- 
tem we have ever contacted.” 

We were out of turtle. Rasmus- 
sen had already given the order 
that would put four technicians 
on board the “prairie schooner.” 
Its destination planet, while 
probably steamy and hot, was 
judged habitable, but its planet 
of origin had far more attrac- 
tion for us. Since we had come out 
of Ultraspan roughly halfway 
between them, there was not much 
doubt about where we would go 
first. 

“W'hen the men solve the con- 
trols of the ship it will be turned 
about, programed for home and 
allowed to return under its own 
power. Mr. Cheng has deter- 
mined that it has been in space for 
about a month. This will give us 
ample time to survey the planet 
and to prepare the senders for its 
return.” 

“You haven’t seen those boys,” 
Pegleg remarked. “They may be 
hard to reason with. Suppose they 
think we done it?” 

“Beings that can build a space- 
ship are reasonable,” the chief de- 
cided. “In any case, we can handle 
the situation.” 

“We always could” I agreed. 
“Pegleg, the chess board waits.”

Ill 

A N HOUR later, all square in 
games, we gave it up and I went 
back to my quarters. It's always 
special when Lindy’s there to 
greet me, but of course that doesn't 
always happen. Lindy's lab is 
one of the more complicated and 
delicate operations aboard the 
Stardust. She always has some- 
thing going. Dr. Linda Peterson 
had been the explorer ship's mi- 
crobiologist from the begin- 
ning. Changing her name to Kis- 
singer hadn't changed her dedi- 
cation. 

But this time she was there. It 
has been eight years now since that 
wedding in the clear sky over 
Cyrene Four and the wonder of it 
is still with me whenever I come 
“home" and she is waiting. 

She's everything I’m not. 

She was a luscious armful 
when I came through the door and 
no woman could have pretended 
the kiss she gave me. Then she 
seized my chin between flashing 
white teeth and bit — sharply. 1 
held her tightly. 

“If that broke the skin I'm go- 
ing to have a hard time explaining 
it,” I said. 

“That’s to remind you,” she 
murmured, “that you’re to tell me 
when you go out! I don’t want to 
hear about it from Johnny or from 
a casual word on the intercom. 
You were climbing over the hulk 
out there like a space-suited louse 



before I even knew you actually 
had gone." 

“Nice comparison,” I said. 
“A psychiatrist could probably 
make something of it.” I held her 
at arm’s length and studied her 
glowing face, dancing green eyes 
and bright hair curling and cas- 
cading over perfect shoulders. 
“I'll always make it back, you 
know. I’ve got something to come 
back to." 

She hugged me again convulsive- 
ly- 

“You're a thick-armed, muscle- 
bound, hairy brute, Roscoe, but 
you’re my hairy brute. Bear with 
me, friend. 1 have to act like a 
woman once in a while." 

I stroked the glistening red 
hair. The ringlets clung to my fin- 
gers. 

“If you were any more like a 
woman 1 probably couldn't stand 
it," I said. “But wait till I com- 
plain." 

“If you think that this was no 
way for a couple of the finer 
heads in the galaxy to behave I 
think I feel a little sorry for you. 
You’ve missed a lot of the wonder 
of living and your marriage is 
probably a complete flop. Which, 
as far as this account is concerned, 
is neither here nor there. We like 
the way we live together. And may- 
be it keeps the strangeness of our 
strangest of all occupations from 
having effect on us eventually. To- 
gether we can take things as they 
come.

GALAXY 




C APTAIN JULES’ technicians 
were stymied for a bit by the 
controls of the derelict, but even- 
tually they worked them out. Lin- 
dy and I were watching on the 
viewscreen in our quarters when 
the ship began to veer, to zigzag, 
to vary its speed as the men exper- 
imented. Then she swept in a slow, 
wide curve and finally steadied, 
her snout pointed back along the 
trail in space she had lately 
traveled. She would go home alone. 

The decision had been a touchy 
one to make. Her captain and nav- 
igator should perhaps have gone 
back with her. Had his form been 
human he probably would have 
gone. But he was only a savage- 
looking, hairy beast — and Jim 
Peters, our chief zoologist, could 
not bear to throw away the only 
really Earthlike specimen we 
had found outside the solar sys- 
tem. It would have broken his 
heart. So the grizzly captain, 
carefully preserved, was in the 
Stardust’s specimen lockers 
when we left his ship to lumber 
home and flashed toward his plan- 
et of origin. 

The pattern after Ultraspan 
had been the busiest I could re- 
member. I usually sleep before 
a stage and was not tired, but to 
have to adjust simultaneously 
to a new space and an emergency 
situation was wearing. Still, 
when the distant planet began to 
grow on the screens the old antici- 
pation came back. We’ve landed 



on new worlds twenty-seven times, 
now and for not one of us will any- 
thing ever be like it. 

We had no way of predicting 
what we were getting into, though 
we had a sample of the planet’s 
life and technology while still 
millions of miles away. Concen- 
trations of population — cities 
in which the citizens were great 
yellow-fanged and hairy beasts — 
were pretty hard to envision, but 
we knew that the chances were 
there. Undoubtedly aircraft would 
be cutting the atmosphere of the 
strangely golden sphere steadily 
expanding on the screens. It was a 
beautiful world. All life planets 
we’ve found have been lovely. 

The entrance bell to our quar- 
ters chimed mellowly and the red 
light glowed. I released the lock. 
Pegleg strolled in, the faintest 
hint of a limp showing as he swung 
his plastic knee. The leg had been 
bitten off by a plesiosaur-like crit- 
ter during one of our first explora- 
tions years before. A lesser man 
would have been handicapped. Peg- 
leg, if you’ll bear with the pun, 
took it in stride. 

“Greetings, both,” he said 
cheerily. “Just dropped in for a 
few social moments and maybe a 
cup of coffee. That is,” he 
amended, “if you have no bour- 
bon.” 

“We’re normally teetotalers, 
as you know,” Lindy said grave- 
ly, “but we might have a wee nip 
for a guest. Sit ye down, Pegleg. 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



19 




And in an hour or so we may find 
out why you really came by.” 

P EGLEG grinned and sat as di- 
rected. Lindy set out bottles, 
glasses and ice. Then, drinks at el- 
bow, we all sat and watched the ap- 
proaching planet grow on the 
viewscreen. 

“It bugs me, Roscoe,” Pegleg 
said abruptly. “Why did that fel- 
low die? The autopsy boys found 
nothing they would judge abnor- 
mal. No injury. No illness.” 

1 swirled the bourbon in my 
glass. 

“I’ve thought about it,” I ad- 
mitted. “He seemed pretty hearty 
just to go without strife or strug- 
gle. But that’s what he did. No 
doubt of it.” 

“If we knew,” Pegleg said 
thoughtfully, “it might help with 
the job coming up. We’ll have to 
report him DOA to his peers and 
contemporaries, won’t we?” 

“You won’t,” I pointed out. 
“That’s Johnny’s job. He’s The 
Man. Your job is rocks.” 

Pegleg raised an eyebrow. 

“I meddle,” he said. “I butt in. 
Furthermore, if they’re unhappy 
with us, I might not have the free- 
dom of their foothills and moun- 
tains, valleys and plains. If they 
don’t like us — I keep remember- 
ing those teeth.” 

“1 doubt they use them on visi- 
tors,” I said. “As Johnny pointed 
out, beings who can build a space- 
ship are reasonable. They were 



predators once, flesh-tearing car- 
nivores no doubt, when they were 
on their way up. Now they’ll prob- 
ably just arrest you and toss you 
in the klink for trespassing.” 

Pegleg held out his glass word- 
lessly and Lindy poured from the 
right bottle. Pegleg preferred to 
use water to bathe in or to brush 
his teeth. 

“He was, if you’ll excuse the ex- 
pression, nude. With all that hair 1 
admit it didn’t make much differ- 
ence. But he wore no ornaments, 
carried no weapon. Further, we 
haven’t found any of either since. 
Comments? Hypotheses? How 
would you tell a policeman if you 
saw one?” 

“We’re taking a lot for 
granted,” I admitted. “He may, 
after all, just have been a big pet 
left behind when the crew aban- 
doned ship.” 

Pegleg shook his head emphat- 
ically. 

“No evidence. No sign of any 
other life. Uh-uh. He ran the 
ship.” 

“His body and mouth micro- 
populations are interesting,” 
Lindy contributed. “My girls are 
working on them. The parasitolo- 
gists have found some real, genu- 
ine worm types in his innards, too. 
But nothing at all that could have 
killed him.” 

The Stardust was under full 
timonium drive. Within the di- 
mensions of any planetary sys- 
tem we don’t have to dawdle

around. We can get where we’re go- 
ing in commuter’s time. We 
figured that the native ship would 
require at least a month to return 
to base, but already the planet 
was looming large on our view- 
screen. We could tell that it was go- 
ing to be a gaudy sight from or- 
bit. 

“Looks better every minute,” I 
said. “Cloud flow patterns, wa- 
ter, poles conspicuously differ- 
ent. This is a world with poten- 
tial, fellow travelers.” 

“The kind of potential is what 
is going to make all the differ- 
ence,” Pegleg said. “I’ll never 
learn to be palsy with anything 
that looks like that local astro- 
naut. No way." 

“Cheer up,” Lindy consoled 
him. “The atmosphere is prob- 
ably ammonia and methane and 
all the exploring any of us will do 
will be a little strolling about in 
suits.” 

Pegleg sipped, adjusted the 
sour look on his narrow face and 
said, “Hah. The air in that ship was 
a neat twenty percent oxygen 
mix, nitrogen buffered and with 
regular. Earth-type humidity. It 
could have come out of the Star- 
dust.” 

Lindy winked at me. 

“I tried,” she said. 

“Bless you,” Pegleg said. “I 
know you mean well. And it does 
look inviting in spite of the natives, 
doesn’t it?” 

It did. 



T HE curve of the planet had 
inched across the screen until 
we looked out on a pattern of con- 
tinents and oceans, cloud patches 
hundreds of miles wide and great 
open areas that glittered in the 
rays of the yellow sun. We could 
feel the checked speed as Captain 
Jules swung us into a long ellipti- 
cal orbit higher than we usually 
implement for our initial look- 
see from space. Johnny Rasmus- 
sen had not forgotten those pos- 
sible aircraft. He wanted to be far 
enough out to detect them or even 
see them coming. 

The intercom rattled, buzzed 
and cleared its throat. Stony Price 
sounded his usual cheery self. 

“ Stardust now in orbit. Dis- 
tance above surface will range 
from five thousand to eight thou- 
sand miles. Time of each orbit, 
thirty-four minutes. Time before 
descent, four hours. Dr. Rasmus- 
sen suggests that tentative pro- 
grams be set up. As for me, when 1 
get down I’m going fishing.” 

Pegleg leaned forward in his 
chair as he studied the slowly 
shifting, varied, colorful sur- 
face. 

“I get ideas from the darndest 
sources,” he said. “How long has it 
been since our last canoe trip 
along good old Snake River, Ros- 
coe?” 

“Too long,” I admitted. Peg- 
leg loves to fish, but naturally 
there was no guarantee that what 
•was in the waters of this world

would faintly resemble Earth-type 
bass or even catfish. 

“Then that’s our tentative pro- 
gram,” Pegleg said with satisfac- 
tion. “Lindy?” 

“Just waiting to be asked,” my 
wife said. 

That was a lot funnier than it 
sounded. My wife is a woman who 
knows her mind. In a situation 
where she has rights she does not 
wait for an invitation. She steps 
right in. 

Pegleg grinned as he offered: 
“I’ll bait your hook. I know how 
you feel about worms.” 

Lindy dutifully said “Ugh,” 
and we settled down to serious 
planning. 

In the next four hours, while the 
Stardust looped the planet seven 
times, a huge mass of data piled 
up. Sensors probed, a variety of 
devices listened and the big zoom 
lenses of our analytical camer- 
as pulled in sample after sample 
of surface detail. Before we go 
down we like to know what we're 
up against. This time, with evi- 
dences of a superior technolo- 
gy and space capabilities, the 
survey was particularly exten- 
sive. And there were some sur- 
prises. 

It was a golden world. This was 
literally so. Vegetation was 
varied, with extensive forest 
lands, wide prairies covered with 
grasslike growth, swamps and 
marshes and great river systems, 
rolling dunes and barriers behind 



the beaches of two vast oceans. 
Ranges of mountains lifted high. 
Each orbit took us over the snow- 
capped poles and long reaches of 
tundra stretched toward what 
seemed to be fields of perpetual 
ice. Earthlike, spectacular, but 
with the green of the vegetation 
of the mother planet replaced by 
gold. The yellows ranged widely in 
intensity. Reds and greens were 
not missing but the impression was 
of a golden sunshine planet. 

One problem — we saw no evi- 
dence of that technologically 
advanced civilization we had 
been expecting. If there were cit- 
ies, any kinds of concentrations 
of beings living together, we 
missed them. And anything of that 
magnitude we couldn’t possibly 
have failed to detect. There were 
long streaks that could have been 
roads, but they certainly were not 
an improved variety. From these, 
secondary branches led off into 
country unpatterned by any ap- 
pearance of development or ag- 
riculture. If there were buildings 
they broke the symmetry of the 
terrain not at all. Certainly noth- 
ing showed that even hinted at a 
civilization with advanced compe- 
tencies. 

“No city complexes. No urban 
sprawl. No industrial pollution. 
No smog—-” Pegleg’s recitation 
was tinged with more than a trace 
of satisfaction. 

“In fact,” Moe Cheng said, “no 
people.”

We were back in control by 
then, the five of us, structuring 
the drop-in as we usually do. 

“And no aircraft, no space- 
craft, no any kind of craft.” I 
turned to Johnny Rasmussen. 
“We didn’t goof, Johnny? The 
spacecraft came from here?" 

The chief nodded. He steepled 
his long fingers and leaned back in 
his chair. A round-bellied brandy 
globe sat at his elbow and he 
glanced at it consideringly but 
did not touch it. To Dr. Johannes 
Rasmussen a fine brandy was 
more a symbol than a drink. He 
seemed to like to know it was there. 

“No doubt at all. Dr. Kissinger. 
We have a hundred verifica- 
tions, including matching radia- 
tion imprints.” He glanced at his 
screen. “An underground civili- 
zation? Don’t bears live in caves?” 

1 grinned. “Brainstorm away,” 
I said. “Our worthy astronaut 
may have looked like a bear but he 
wasn’t one. The anatomy boys 
find his brain fascinating and his 
nervous system bewildering. 
The cells are so different that 
they’re puzzled. His appearance 
is coincidence enough.” 

“Perhaps,” Moe Cheng suggest- 
ed, “they have outgrown aggregate 
organization — have matured be- 
yond it. Perhaps what we see is all 
there is.” 

“There were no weapons, no de- 
vices for defense aboard the space- 
ship. Even if there were ships in the 
sky I doubt we’d be in any kind of 



danger." Rasmussen finally closed 
his long fingers around his brandy 
glass. 

“Too simple,” Pegleg said 
gloomily. “That fellow was a 
weapon. And where are the ships? 
Camouflaged, naturally — along 
with the industries that would 
have to exist to construct them. 
When we get in closer there will be 
ships." 

“Camouflaged against what?” 1 
bounced the idea back. “At five 
thousand miles we are bound to 
miss a few things. I agree we’ll see 
ships, but they won't be hidden. 
And what do you care — as long as 
they don't scare the fish?” 

IV 

W E CHOSE our drop-in spot 
with due regard for everyone’s 
needs. Since there was nothing 
special to focus on we picked a lo- 
cation where we would just natu- 
rally feel at home. The season in 
the northern hemisphere was late 
summer. The Stardust swept 
down into an atmosphere as 
sweet as that of old Earth before 
pollution came, burrowed brief- 
ly through sheets of white clouds 
and then drifted smoothly a few 
hundred feet above a golden 
plain. 

“Where foothills and forest 
and water and prairie all meet, 
please,” I requested. 

“Would you also like a road 
and perhaps some buildings?”

Moe Cheng asked gently. “We’ll 
see what we can do.” 

“A fishing stream,” Pegleg put 
in, “with nice rock outcrops in the 
neighborhood for study when 
they’re not biting.” 

“Flowers.” Lindy stood in the 
control room doorway. “1 want 
something different for my 
vases.” 

And Captain Jules deliv- 
ered — on almost all counts. He 
brought the Stardust in like a leaf 
sliding down a summer breeze, 
her thousands of tons of mass 
turned into nothing by her newly 
redesigned timonium anti-gravs. 
She settled at full length onto a 
sunny open slope and a field of 
golden flowers stretched away and 
down to a little stream glinting and 
winking in the distance. Hills rose 
beyond, bright with red and yellow 
forest growth. 

In a way it was a first. 

We had found life many times, 
ecosystems based in an oxygen at- 
mosphere maintained by photo- 
synthesis, but heretofore the actu- 
al forms had always been different. 
The vegetation before us now was 
Earthlike. Add the fact that our 
astronaut had been a mammal-like 
— even bear-like — tetrapod, and 
the laws of probability became a 
bit stretched. You can see why we 
hung over the viewscreens and 
why 1 itched to be out and about. 
Pegleg’s nonesense about fishing 
had, of course, been just that — but 
in the landscape before us it 



looked completely reasonable. 
The flowers seemed quite suitable 
for Lindy’s vases. I could almost 
see Ursula Potts, with easel and 
load of painting paraphernalia, 
sitting on that golden slope un- 
der her red umbrella, painting 
and analyzing this pleasant world. 

But we waited, as always, while 
sensors probed, analyses were 
made, and while every device the 
Stardust possessed checked and 
rechecked the atmosphere, the 
radiation, the possible hazards 
of the microlife to human ex- 
plorers out there in the yellow sun- 
shine. And the final results were 
gratifying. 

Stony Price summarized on in- 
tercom: “Dr. Rasmussen’s com- 
munique — official. A compat- 
ible world. Free reconnaissance 
is authorized for seventy-two 
hours, at the end of which time all 
major research heads and team 
chiefs will meet to formulate the 
coverage pattern. There must, as 
usual, be twenty percent of total 
personnel aboard the Stardust at 
all times. As for me — as I said, I’m 
going fishing.” 

“Me too,” Pegleg said. “I bet 
there’ll be crickets under logs. 
Best bait there is.” 

W HEN it came to security 
around the Stardust, Captain 
Jules was a purist. Two guards, 
laser guns in hand, stood at each of 
the four activated personnel 
ports. Since nothing in sight was 



24 



GALAXY 




moving, the precaution seemed a 
little much. In all the landings we 
have made the ship has never yet 
been attacked — it usually takes a 
lot of coaxing to get anything 
even to approach it. But guards 
stood by as field parties drifted out 
and spread casually over the near- 
by terrain. 

Nobody seemed in a hurry. 
There was a pervasive quiet about 
the scene, a sleepy tranquility that 
was pleasant and infectious. We 
seemed to have no ambition at all. 
Then, too, it was late afternoon 
and none of us had slept since the 
stage. 

So I didn't go afield after all. I 
extruded a jumper platform high 
on the side of the Stardust and 
Lindy and I sat there, forty feet 
above the meadow, and breathed 
deep of the winy air while we swept 
our surroundings with binocu- 
lars and the yellow sun sank slowly 
behind the western hills. 

“Beautiful.” Lindy sighed. 
“There's no strife on this world, 
Roscoe. I’d feel it.” 

“I trust your feelings within 
limits,” I said. “But there is strife 
in any ecosystem. Has to be. Out 
there under our eyes things are 
killing other things, rending and 
tearing and devouring. Every or- 
ganic crumb is being contended 
for. Death is happening that life 
may go on.” 

My wife gave me a disgusted 
look. 

“You can really louse up a 



mood, can’t you?” She tried to 
frown, but hers is not a face on 
which a frown feels at home. “You 
know what I mean. Quit being an 
ecologist for a few minutes, Ros- 
coe. Be glad of a planet where 
there are no wars, no contending 
populations, no technologies 
trying to crowd each other out of 
existence.” She breathed deeply. 
“Smell that air. There’s no taint in 
it. No pollution. I’m going to 
love it here.” 

“How can you tell?” I protested. 
“A spacecraft came from here. It 
was manned by a big preda- 
tor — with teeth. There you have 
potential for both pollution and 
strife.” 

Lindy shook her head. 

“Somehow I don’t believe those 
exist here. Oh, I grant your carniv- 
ore and your ecological interac- 
tion. Of course I know that is go- 
ing on. But nothing consciously 
structured is evil here. This is a 
natural world." 

“You become more like Ursula 
every day.” I grinned. “Just don’t 
start looking like her.” 

My eye picked up movement far 
across the prairie and I swung the 
binoculars into position. Living 
things were moving, big things. I 
pulled them into focus and 
zoomed them closer. The result 
was a little astonishing. Back on 
Earth they would have been, with- 
out any doubt, cattle. A fair-sized 
herd was bobbing along, running 
easily. I could plainly see heavy, 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



25 




horned heads, shaggy forequar- 
ters, high humps at the shoulders. 
Cattle? 1 revised my impression. 
They looked more like bison, the 
buffalo of the old American 
West. There were differences, like 
the splotched, varied pinto color- 
ing, black and brown and red and 
white. No two animals seemed 
coated exactly alike. 

Lindy had her glasses up. The 
herd galloped behind a finger of 
woodland and most of it was lost 
to sight. I lowered my binocu- 
lars, but focused them again when I 
heard Lindy gasp. The herd reap- 
peared, this time in headlong 
flight. 

“There was something,” Lindy 
said. “It's behind the trees now — 
but it got one of them.” 

I swept the area, but could see 
nothing. 

“Any impressions?” 

Lindy lowered her glass and 
looked at me gravely. 

“A very definite impression. 
Big, black, heavily furred. Ran on 
all fours, but rose on hind legs to 
strike. Brought down its prey with 
one swipe and dragged it behind 
those trees.” 

“In short — ” 

Lindy nodded. “It looked like 
the astronaut. Very much like the 
astronaut.” 

I felt a little chagrined. So we 
had been off the beam. The thing 
had been a pet, after all. The 
builders of the spaceship were 



still unknown and we would do 
well to get up some pretty careful 
reconnaissance. Johnny Ras- 
mussen would be interested. 

He was, of course. He was puz- 
zled, too. As I was. We had grown 
used to thinking of the big bear- 
like creature as the “thinking 
man” of the world. Now we had to 
start all over. And we had, as we 
realized, no starting point, no 
clues. 

Pegleg had only wandered as far 
as the stream and had seen noth- 
ing. Nothing big, that is. 

“Varmints were pretty shy," he 
reported. “Couldn't get close. I 
didn’t take glasses, so 1 only got 
impressions.” He snapped his fin- 
gers. “One thing, though, Roscoe. 
Butterflies. Huge things and no 
end gaudy. They must have had 
two-foot wingspreads. You'll have 
to net them like birds.” 

“Not if I can help it,” I said. 
“Let Jim Peters and his boys col- 
lect. But at least your insects 
maintain the pattern — Earthlike 
forms have evolved here. We recog- 
nize everything. Nothing is weird. 
They all look like things we have 
seen before. 

Pegleg nodded. 

“Those fish actually seem more 
likely now. Care to join me tomor- 
row?” 

“I just might,” 1 agreed. “But 1 
never have any luck.” 

“Then you can watch me,” Peg- 
leg said smugly. 



26 



GALAXY 




T HE Seven Suns lie in a major 
arm of the galactic spiral and 
the night sky from our planet was 
a memorable thing. Stars crowded 
it, packed into swirls and clusters 
and strange alignments that would 
have been unbelievable on Earth. 
There was no moon, but the land- 
scape showed clearly in the soft 
light of the myriad stars. 

Lindy and I watched it on our 
own viewscreen, lolling in bed af- 
ter a comfortable meal. 1 must 
have blinked. When I opened my 
eyes the screen showed the flower- 
strewn slope with wet dew in gold- 
en morning sun. Ten hours with- 
out moving! Lindy still slept 
peacefully beside me. Our inter- 
com was buzzing softly. I flipped 
the switch. 

“As I thought, still sacked out,” 
said Pegleg's voice. “Take nourish- 
ment and meet me down by the 
stream. I’m all set to try those 
fish.” 

“Roger,” I whispered. “Let my 
weary spouse sleep.” 

Pegleg had busied himself col- 
lecting local bait. I brought meat 
strips, but he had an assortment 
of insectlike forms in a little 
plastic bag. He was whipping a fi- 
berglass rod and testing his reel 
when I came up. 

“Made to order,” he said com- 
placently. “Shadows darted into 
that deep pool over there when I 
first got here. Water's full of life.” 

I was interested in his bait col- 
lection. It might have come from 



any hayfield in North America. 
Pegleg hooked one bit of bait. It 
gave a tiny, piercing shriek and ex- 
pired promptly. 

“Well that’s different.” Pegleg 
looked a little startled. “If I have 
to listen to that every time I bait 
up I’ll be reduced to dry flies.” But 
he flipped the bait out into the 
pool and , fished deep. I watched 
him for a couple of minutes. Noth- 
ing. 

I threaded one of my meat strips 
on a hook and tossed it out. In- 
stantly the water boiled. My rod 
was nearly snatched from my 
hand and I struck hard to set the 
hook. I expected a fight — but I 
didn’t get it. My fish darted around 
the pool. I gave it line. Then it did 
the completely unexpected. It 
zipped toward me. I stepped back 
a couple of strides and it climbed 
out on a rock. It was a small, glis- 
tening humanoid with webbed fin- 
gers and toes and a short shiny tail. 
It stood erect, gulping, and the gill 
slits along the sides of its neck 
sealed themselves and became 
obscure. The creature took a deep 
breath of air, then proceeded to 
deliver itself of one of the most 
versatile strings of profanity I had 
heard. The words were clear and 
specific and, since this is a family 
publication, I won’t repeat them 
here. 

The little fellow was beside him- 
self with rage. His blue eyes blazed, 
his thin lips drew back over even 
white teeth as the vitriol poured 



BIRDSFLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



27 




out. But after a moment he sub- 
sided. He stood on the rock, hold- 
ing his little four-fingered hands 
out in front of him. The hook had 
pinned them together through the 
webs between the fingers. A dark 
trickle of blood ran down his arms. 
Suddenly he looked very tiny, 
grotesque and pitiful. 

“Dirty pool,” he said almost re- 
flectively. “Dirty, dirty, dirty 
pool. Even a waakan wouldn’t do a 
thing like that.” 

He eyed me, his anger gone. He 
must have been hurting. But as he 
realized my strange appearance 
he became all curiosity. 

N OW, as you may know, I’m a 
fairly hearty chunk of man. My 
arms and legs are thick. My chest 
is deep and all visible areas except 
my face, which I shave, and the top 
of my head, which I don’t, are cov- 
ered with matted black hair'. Lindy 
and I have gone to parties as 
Beauty and the Beast — without 
makeup. Right there I was wearing 
shorts and sandals, so he got a 
maximum view. 

“Different,” he piped. “Like a 
marat, like a waakan, even like an 
obit without wings.” He studied 
me calmly now. “Are you going 
to eat me?” 

“Nothing is farther from my 
mind,” I heard myself protest- 
ing. “I was fishing for fish. How 
could I know that something like 
you would take my bait?” 

“Because it is my pool,” the lit- 



tle fellow said. “Every pool has a 
marat. But,” he added, “I can see 
you would not know that.” 

Pegleg had been standing a few 
yards away, staring with fascina- 
tion at the tiny manlike creature. 
He was reeling in his bait slowly, 
automatically. 

“I’m hearing this, ain’t I, 
Roscoe? I haven’t had a seizure of 
some sort?” 

The small humanoid turned to- 
ward him. 

Pegleg was also wearing shorts 
and sandals, but his long sinewy 
body had almost no hair at all. We 
hardly seemed to belong to the 
same species. To the marat it must 
have been confusing. He shook his 
head. Short, greenish ringlets 
bobbed and curled around his 
temples as the sun dried and fluffed 
them. His features were unformed, 
coarse, and his eyes glistened with 
cunning. More and more he looked 
like a nasty little man. 

“You don’t look alike,” he said, 
“but you must have migrated to- 
gether. Why did you come here? 
Only obits migrate.” 

“We have come from a great dis- 
tance,” I said. “You couldn’t un- 
derstand. We don’t plan to stay 
long and we mean no harm to any 
living thing. You must be in pain. 
Let me take the hook out of your 
hands.” 

The marat’s bright eyes glittered 
with suspicion. 

“Don’t come near me,” he warn- 
ed. “You probably do intend to 



28 



GALAXY 




eat me.” He held his pinioned 
hands to his mouth and bit through 
the leader just behind the hook. 
“Now,” he said, “you cannot hold 
me. Somehow 1 will take the 
metal out of my webs. It is not a 
bad hurt.” 

“There’s a barb on the hook,” I 
said. “It’ll be hard to get out. Bet- 
ter let me do it.” 

“You mean no harm to any liv- 
ing thing,” the marat mimicked. 
“That is why you put a hook in my 
pool. That is why the hook has a 
barb.” H is little face wrinkled like 
a monkey’s. He turned and slid 
soundlessly into the stream. We 
could see a shadow like a darting 
trout that swiftly vanished under 
the far bank. 

We looked at the gently flowing 
water, then at each other. Pegleg 
began to pack up his tackle. 

“Whenever I leave geology I’m 
sorry,” he said. “You can explain 
that little character any time 
you’re ready, Roscoe. Start with 
the speech. We’re a hundred and 
thirty light-years from the nearest 
English-speaking community 
and he gives with more dirty 
wordies than I know. It ain’t no 
way possible. But I heard it.” 

“Get used to it,” I advised. “I 
think that’s the most easily ac- 
counted for thing in this contact. 
It has been hypothesized for years. 
Could be we’ll be getting chit-chat 
from other little varmints as well. 
And maybe big ones. Even the bait 
screamed when you hooked it.” 



“He looked like a man,” Pegleg 
said. “Like a blasted pixie out of a 
fairy book. But let’s have the 
speech hypothesis.” 

“You heard English,” I said, 
“but if I’m right, he didn’t. To him 
I was speaking marat talk. We 
were verbalizing meanings and 
each of us hearing them in his own 
vocal symbols. The process is part- 
ly telepathic. Anyhow, it’s an old 
idea. Naturally I don’t know 
why it works here. But he didn’t 
use dirty words you don’t know. 
You heard the ones you would have 
used.” 

Pegleg unjointed his rod. “Well, 
shame on me,” he mumbled. “I 
should have my mind washed out 
with soap.” 

I grinned. 

“The thought has occurred to me 
before.” 

Pegleg opened his bait bag. The 
little creatures hopped and flew in 
all directions. 

“Are you actually saying that all 
the indigenous life forms will be 
giving us the edges of their 
tongues? That’ll be a switch!” 

“May happen,” I said. 

“I can hardly wait to be called 
what I am by another one. What 
are your plans, Roscoe, now that 
the fishing is all washed up, so to 
speak?” • 

“I’ll just do a walkabout in the 
neighborhood,” I decided. “You’re 
welcome to come along.” 

“Uh-uh.” Pegleg shook his head 
and tapped the rock hammer in his 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



29 




belt. “Rocks don’t talk back — or 
at least they never have. I’ll ex- 
plore the ledge up the slope and 
take a few specimens to work on.” 

“Be happy,” I said. 

I cached my fishing gear and fol- 
lowed the stream for a while. 
Woody brush grew thickly here 
and there. Several species of 
shrubs mingled and at least one 
kind was heavy with small, golden 
plumlike fruit. I speculated as to 
their edibility, but I didn’t sample. 
There are safer ways of finding 
out. 

My feet were almost automatic- 
ally following what I would have 
called a game trail, if I had 
thought about it. I rounded a 
clump of the plum bushes and al- 
most ran into him. 

I DIDN’T startle him, of course. 

He had heard and probably 
smelled me coming. In fact, he was 
waiting for me. He stood com- 
posedly, a huge shaggy hulk eight 
feet tall, both great forepaws Tilled 
with golden fruit and his bearlike 
muzzle most untidy with juice. His 
small black eyes looked me over 
with intelligent interest. He drew 
back his lips from great yellow 
fangs and I realized that he was 
simulating a smile. 

“I expected you,” he said casu- 
ally, “but I still don’t believe you.” 
His deep voice was smooth and 
controlled. 

I shifted my hand a little guiltily 
away from my laser gun. 



“I’m having trouble believing 
you — so we’re even,” I said. “I’ve 
seen one of your race before. The 
thing that puzzles me most is — we 
can communicate. Sounds like 
speech, but I suppose that is 
simpler than the fact.” 

“Did you think,” the big beast 
growled, “that the superior races 
of this world would be dull and 
silent like vada? Like cattle?” 

“It isn’t that you speak — it’s 
that I can understand. Across this 
sector of the galaxy that isn’t usual, 
you know.” 

“No, I don’t know. I have never 
seen an intelligent being with 
whom I couldn’t communicate.” 

“In English?” 

The Dominant, as I thought of 
him, studied me reflectively. He 
tossed several plums expertly be- 
tween those rows of teeth and 
chewed. 

“In meanings, I suppose. You 
are complex. It is good to feel 
your mind. This makes your ap- 
pearance all the more remark- 
able. You are the first superior 
form in my experience to re- 
semble the obits and the marats of 
Gossoon.” 

“Marat I comprehend,” I said. 
“We met one. It mentioned obits, 
but I haven’t seen any as far as I 
know.” 

Again that skinning of yellow 
fangs that was the creature’s ver- 
sion of a smile. 

“They are abundant,” he said. 
“They have bright wings and live 



30 



GALAXY 




high in trees, where they make 
small shelters and feed on fruit. 
They are hard to catch. I rarely 
taste one.” 

That shocked me. 

"You eat them? 1 thought it was 
possible to speak with them. The 
marat was voluble enough." 

"Naturally," said the Dominant 
scornfully. “It's just that they are 
lower forms. They have no tech- 
nology and no scholarship. They 
are animals, a nice change of diet 
from vada, which are our staple 
food." 

The calm, measured speech of 
the great brute was, you may be- 
lieve, disconcerting. 

“Suppose I mention,” 1 said, 
“that you resemble lower forms 
on my world. Forms that cannot 
speak and have no superior aware- 
ness at all.” 

"I can believe it." the Dominant 
said steadily. “We must speak 
with you at length. We have not the 
capacity you obviously have to 
span galactic distance. Tech- 
nologically we might, but phy- 
sically we seem hampered. After 
a certain time in space we die of a 
strange sickness. It is a problem 
we have yet to solve." 

“That, 1 think, is why we are 
here.” I still felt silly talking to the 
creature, but his intelligence and 
comprehension were beyond doubt. 
We had changed our minds too 
quickly yesterday. 

So I told him of the derelict 
with one of his kind aboard, of how 



we had turned the ship about until 
now it was speeding home again. 

His small eyes gleamed with in- 
terest and curiosity. 

“Your ship is very big,” he said. 
“We observed it with wonder as it 
swung in orbit. Now I reason that 
it must travel at a multiple of light 
speed. This troubles my mathe- 
matics— but it must be so." 

To have a giant bear discussing 
spaceships and mathematics 
while inelegantly stuffing fruit 
into itself was almost too much, 
but I held on. 

“There was only one individual 
in your ship," 1 remarked. 

The Dominant nodded. 

“All that was necessary. We do 
not grow lonely and by choice we 
work alone. We prefer much in- 
dividual space. Only the obits, the 
marats and the stupid vada and 
their like stay together in groups. 
We do not consider it conducive 
to intellectual progress.” 

“Yet you say you enjoy the feel 
of my mind.” 

“Very much. The feel of an- 
other intellect is always good. But 
when we meet it is for a reason. 
When the reason has been 
satisfied we part. To each his own 
space, his own work, his own 
pleasures.” 

I was puzzled and I suppose I 
showed it. 

“There is a contradiction here. 
You don’t live together — yet you 
make spaceships. This requires 
materials, shops, sophisticated 



BIRDSFLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



31 




equipment, cooperative effort. 
It requires an elaborate tech- 
nology. Would you care to ex- 
plain?" 

The Dominant waved a hairy 
paw toward the thickly hanging 
plums. 

“The fruits are good food," he 
invited. “There is nothing in them 
but harmless carbohydrates and 
simple proteins. You can prob- 
ably tolerate them. Ah, yes — the 
technology. We have it, as you 
say. But we do not use it to 
live — only to learn by. We space 
ourselves so that our environ- 
ment feeds us. We exchange ma- 
terials that we need for our experi- 
ments and investigations. We 
share labor for brief periods. But it 
always good when the laborers re- 
turn to their own territories. My 
vada herds would soon grow small 
if there were many eaters. I hope,” 
he added and he seemed a little 
concerned, “that your ship can 
feed its people. You are almost in 
the middle of my territory.” 

I could reassure him on the 
point — and did. 

“We couldn’t depend on finding 
food on unknown worlds,” I 
pointed out. “Our supplies will 
last for years. And even if we used 
them all we could recycle organic 
stuffs forever.” 

“In that case,” the Dominant 
said, “I am glad you are here. We 
will share knowledge and I will be- 
come the best informed waakan 
on Gossoon.” 



I T WAS a naive statement and 
one that went well with the ap- 
parently simple life organization 
of his species. But I wasn’t going 
to take that simplicity without a 
large grain of salt. 

“One of us saw you yesterday, 
pulling down what I suppose was a 
vada? Do you hunt down and kill 
your meat using only your own 
strength?” 

The waakan sat back on his 
haunches and picked his teeth with 
a clawed, clever finger. 

“How else? If we have not 
strength to kill our meat we do not 
deserve to eat. If the vada can 
avoid us it lives long, eats much 
vegetation and produces more 
vada. We eat the slow and stupid 
ones and there is more grass for 
those that survive.” 

“A fair shake for everybody,” I 
agreed. “On my home world, many 
years ago, a man named Darwin 
first pointed out how the fittest 
survive. But I never heard of an 
intelligent species applying the 
idea as a life pattern.” 

The waakan flicked an ear. 
“Anything else would be a death 
pattern,” he said. 

I forgot that I was speaking to a 
most unlikely being. He had be- 
come an intellect voicing an idea. 

“That is oversimplification,” I 
argued. “My race, the race of 
man, has achieved much and is 
spreading far. Yet we are destruc- 
tive. We kill without reason. We 
don’t live as you do.”

GALAXY 




“An idea can be cluttered with 
detail until it loses its shape,” the 
waakan said placidly, “but it re- 
mains the same idea. I do not be- 
lieve that living things can de- 
stroy their life sources and contin- 
ue to live.” 

While we talked the voices of 
many people had been reaching 
us from the fields around the Star- 
dust , from along the stream and 
from far up the slope where, pre- 
sumably, Pegleg was swinging 
his hammer against an inoffen- 
sive rock ledge. Now I realized 
that some were close by. So did the 
Dominant. 

“We shall have much talk,” the 
waakan said. “But first I think you 
had better prepare your people 
for me. 1 don’t wish to feel the en- 
ergy of anything like that device 
that you carry at your hip.” 

He grinned his terrifying grin, 
dropped to all fours and literally 
melted into the brush. He simply 
vanished. No weasel could have 
left less spoor, less evidence of its 
passing. 

I plucked a couple of the plums 
and wandered back down the trail. 
The fruits were beautiful but their 
taste was foul. 1 threw them away. 
Native biomass is usually not very 
palatable. I wondered vaguely why 
the waakan had picked me for con- 
tact rather than other Stardust 
crewmen now reveling in the feel 
of this pleasant world. For I had 
been selected — no doubt about 
that. Because of my extra body 



hair? Did the shaggy creature 
sense interest, lack of fear? Could 
it read minds? I didn’t have an an- 
swer. 

I thumbed my belt communi- 
cator, got Stony Price and gave 
him a quick fill-in. 

“Pass it around. Stony,” I said. 
“I know everybody knows the 
rules ••• but remind them. You saw 
the dead astronaut. But you can’t 
imagine what a living one looks 
like, close up. Even a steady set of 
nerves could get laserhappy.” 

“Will do,” Stony said. “1 can be- 
lieve anything. You heard about 
my fishing trip?” 

I grinned. “You had adventures? 
What did you catch?” 

“Nothing” said Stony Price. 
“But one climbed out on a rock 
and cussed me out for trying. And 
I have not been at Rasmussen’s 
brandy — ” 

“I know, Stony,” I said sooth- 
ingly. “They’re called marats, and 
they have nasty tempers. The wa- 
ters hereabouts seem to be full of 
them. The one I saw looked just 
like an uncle of mine.” 

“What a world,” Stony grum- 
bled. “Be careful, Roscoe. That 
pretty sunshine will probably give 
your wife warts instead of freck- 
les.” 

I signed off, chuckling. 

M AN is an adaptable creature — 
he can get used to anything.

me. Before long, 1 expected, I 
would be surprised when anything 
1 met did not greet me with a quip 
or a dirty word — or, perhaps, a 
profound philosophical state- 
ment. 

I considered communicating 
with Lindy, then decided to hunt 
up Pegleg before I went back to 
the ship. I had only walked a cou- 
ple of miles and my space-softened 
muscles needed tightening. At 
one spot the stream spread into 
wide shallow riffles, so I waded it, 
put my legs to the slope beyond 
and had a nice workout before I 
reached the first of the low cliffs 
and rugged outcrops that had at- 
tracted Pegleg. 

I had probably upped my eleva- 
tion three hundred feet or so. The 
panorama that spread out below 
me was both pleasing and infor- 
mative. The stream wound and 
meandered and finally lost it- 
self around a flank of the uplift I 
had climbed. It was mostly tre.e- 
bordered, cool and pleasant in the 
yellow sun. I could look over the 
patchy brush areas and out to the 
extensive prairie beyond. The 
Stardust lay inert and prone, a 
huge, featureless, glittering sau- 
sage, her fifteen hundred feet of 
length blending with and scarcely 
disturbing the symmetry of the 
landscape. And nothing pise in- 
terrupted it at all. I saw no sign of 
anything the waakan might have 
built, helpers or no helpers. No 
sign of the waakan, either. 



I could hear voices along the out- 
crop. Slowly it seeped into my 
consciousness that they were not 
familiar voices. No one from the 
Stardust would have spoken in 
those high, sweet, thin notes. They 
sounded like the babble of chil- 
dren playing. But occasionally 
I also heard Pegleg's deeper 
tones. I slipped around the shoul- 
der of the outcrop and, to use the 
waakan’s statement, I didn’t be- 
lieve what I saw. 

Large bright patches of vivid 
color wavered and fluttered and 
swept in erratic circles in the air 
around Pegleg, who was sitting 
on a big flat stone that had split 
loose from the ragged wall behind 
him. His rockbag and hammer 
lay nearby. The scene was like a 
convention of giant butterflies, 
with Pegleg the flower. He did not 
appear bothered — merely amused. 

“If you'd just light somewhere,” 
Pegleg was saying, "and speak 
one at a time we’d all learn some- 
thing. Settle down.” 



T HE twittering voices trailed 
away. The gaudy creatures 
drifted to nearby rocks or clung to 
handy tree branches. All save one. 
It hovered before Pegleg, great 
wings waving gently, studying 
him intently. Then it dropped 
gracefully and perched daintily 
on his knee. 

“You will not harm me,” she 
piped sweetly. She studied him 



34 



GALAXY 




with her small head tilted. “You 
are very beautiful,” she said. 

A she. There was not the 
slightest doubt of it. With the 
mauve and silver, two-foot wings 
folded back, a tiny naked female, 
human in all but size, sat and 
swung diminutive, four-toed 
feet. She brushed back long dark 
hair and smiled up at the surprised 
Pegleg. I knew him. He was em- 
barrassed. He hadn’t expected 
that. 

I gave him credit, though — he 
bounced back strongly. He studied 
the lovely little being on his 
knee. 

“How do you know 1 won’t 
harm you?” he demanded. 

“Because you like me,” she said. 
“You think I am beautiful and I 
think you are beautiful. 1 will go 
with you to your nest.” 

The childlike phrasing didn’t 
have the sophistication of the 
marat. These obviously were 
simpler beings. 

“If you were five or six times the 
size you are it might be a good of- 
fer,” Pegleg observed wryly. 
"Can’t you see I’m not like you? I 
haven’t even got wings.” 

“I know.” The little thing shook 
her perfect head. “You are a 
strange kind of obit. How can you 
migrate without wings?” 

Pegleg grinned. “I manage” 

He looked around, as I was do- 
ing, at the colorful little crea- 
tures perched all about. With wings 
folded back they were amazingly 



like small people. I’d have guessed 
fourteen, sixteen inches for an 
average height. Their hair was 
long and the tiny males had scanty 
wisps of beard. The color was 
mostly on the wings and in this no 
two were alike. Their skins were a 
golden tan. None wore even a 
scrap of clothing or ornament. 

“I dig,” Pegleg said. “You are 
obits. Right?” 

“What else would we be?” A lit- 
tle male with maroon wings spoke 
in a resonant tenor. “Only obits 
have wings. You are a different 
creature and La-ling should not sit 
against you.” 

“It was her idea,” Pegleg pro- 
tested. “I’m as innocent as new- 
fallen snow.” 

All the little creatures 
shuddered. 

“Do not speak of the snow,” tiny 
La-ling said. “We hate it. When it 
comes we must migrate, for the 
fruits freeze and the cold winds 
blow us. When winter comes we 
must be far along our journey. If 
the snow catches us we die. We can 
fly only in warmth and sunshine.” 

“Amazing.” Pegleg looked as 
nonplused as he ever gets. “Do 
you know the marats in the water? 
I don’t see how they could mi- 
grate. What happens to them in 
the cold?” 

The obits made gestures of dis- 
gust. 

“The marats are nasty 
creatures,” one said. “We would 
not care if they froze. They say

they gather in deep pools or bury 
themselves far into the mud. But 
they are always liars. Who knows 
what they do? They are here when 
we fly south and they are here when 
we return.” 

Pegleg shook his head. Then his 
narrow face relaxed and he be- 
gan to chuckle. 

“My friend Roscoe is going to be 
fascinated by you.” 

“Starting now,” 1 said and 
moved out into the open. 

The obits rose in a colorful, flut- 
tering cloud, their high voices 
shrilling. La-ling took wing with 
the rest, but after a moment she 
dropped back to Pegleg’s shoul- 
der and clung tightly to his hair 
with small four-fingered hands. 

I walked forward slowly, smil- 
ing and trying to look as innoc- 
uous as possible. 

“I know you have a girl in every 
spaceport, Pegleg,” I remarked, 
“but this is ridiculous. Don’t you 
ever turn off the charm?” 

“No apologies,” Pegleg said. He 
put up a hand to steady La-ling on 
his shoulder. “1 am a mite embar- 
rassed, though. As you can plainly 
see, this little lady ain’t wearing 
no lingerie. But it’s just the style. 
Not my idea.” 

“I must believe you,” I said, 
“because 1 eavesdropped. Ap- 
parently we’ve been tapped, Peg- 
leg, you and I. The local popu- 
laces are attracted to us. I’ve just 
been chewing the fat with the resi- 
dent waakan.” 



The little obit rocketed from 
Pegleg’s shoulder. She cut the air 
above us, a mauve and silver 
streak, hissing like an angry cat. I 
had really punched the wrong 
button. 

WWOU said the secret word.” 

1 Pegleg waved at the angrily 
circling little creature. “Come 
on down. La-ling. We need you. 
Nothing will harm you. I prom- 
ise.” He held out an arm and the 
little thing drifted sulkily down. 
She teetered lightly on the arm, 
then walked along it to the shoul- 
der again. Her golden eyes were 
fixed widely on me. Her lips 
writhed back over tiny sharp teeth, 
glistening white. She looked less 
human, then, and more like the 
small winged animal she was. 

“The waakan would eat us,” she 
spat, “but he cannot fly. This one 
has fur like the waakan, but he 
looks like an obit. I do not under- 
stand.” 

The last was a whimper. Again 
she dug her little fingers into 
Pegleg’s hair. 

Pegleg raised his eyebrows in- 
quiringly. 

“The waakan is the astronaut,” 
1 explained. “Or rather, the as- 
tronaut’s brother or cousin. The 
teeth are for real, but they just use 
them for legitimate food, appar- 
ently. He did mention a taste for 
obits.” 

“Cruel, wicked creature,” La- 
ling said indignantly. 



36 



GALAXY 




“He can’t catch you,” I said 
soothingly. “Nothing can fly like 
an obit.” 

She waved her wings and looked 
pleased. 

“He is very wise, though. He 
does most wonderful things. We 
watch him from the trees.” 

“Interesting,” I commented. 
“And where does he do those won- 
derful things, La-ling? Does he 
have a nest?” 

The other obits of the flock had 
floated down cautiously and were 
again perched about on the rocks 
and branches. 

“The waakan’s nest is very large 
and is made all of stones. Many 
waakan came and they stuck the 
stones together with a strange 
mud.” 

“And where,” I urged, “is this 
nest?” 

All the little creatures giggled 
like children, a whole chorus of 
high-pitched sounds. They faced 
down the slope. All were pointing 
with small forefingers. 

“You have no eyes,” one 
chuckled. “See, it grows out of the 
hillside.” 

And it did. I could have kicked 
myself. What seemed a long ridge 
abutting the slope was actually 
artificial. Huge irregular stones 
had been fitted cunningly together, 
partly covered over with soil and 
masked with golden vegetation. 
The very size of this, the building 
we had looked for in vain from 
space, pretty well guaranteed some 



advanced construction techniques. 
The ridge was easily a hundred 
yards long. 

“Now we’re getting somewhere. 
Let’s visit, Pegleg.” 

“Well as long as you can vouch 
for your friends,” Pegleg said. 
“But these little people had bet- 
ter fly away home.” 

“I imagine they know what they 
can do. Where does the waakan en- 
ter his nest. La-ling?” 

“Many places,” said the little 
obit. “He pushes away the stones.” 
“Many places,” the obits 
chorused. 

As we strode down the slope they 
rose like a flock of butterflies, 
wavering higher and higher. La- 
ling fluttered above Pegleg’s 
head, but when we were close to the 
ridge she sailed after the others and 
disappeared from sight. 

Pegleg asked sourly, “Wasn’t it 
you who commented on how 
natural everything is here?” 

“You expect small differ- 
ences,” I grinned. “Wait till you 
chat with the waakan.” 

“I can hang on,” Pegleg said 
dryly. “Indefinitely if neces- 
sary.” 

A thorough search along the 
great stone structure revealed 
several places where the stones 
were not mortared but we could 
move none of them. We realized 
that, like it or not, we would have 
to adjust ourselves to the 
waakan’s pleasure. He was not yet 
receiving guests.

VI 

W HEN Lindy worked in her lab, 
directing her three young as- 
sociates in the complex of cul- 
tures and surveys that a touch- 
down always brought, she was 
every serious inch Dr. Linda Kis- 
singer, microbiologist without 
peer. But out in the field with me 
she was a happy, glowing young 
woman — living right now. And in 
the several days that followed she 
was with me a lot. She was — and 
is — the closest thing to a galactic 
sociologist I’ve ever known. She’s 
everything’s friend. 

The obits delighted her. She 
soon had them around her in 
swarms. She coaxed marats out of 
pools. And always we were wait- 
ing for the waakan. 

I knew he would appear when 
he was ready. In retrospect I 
think he was giving us time to ori- 
ent ourselves, to adjust to the ar- 
rangement of things on his planet. 
He gave us a week. 

One morning he showed up in 
the meadow just beyond the Star- 
dust. Nobody saw him come. 
Someone simply happened to 
notice him through a viewport, 
sitting on his haunches among the 
yellow flowers, casually groom- 
ing his fur — with his tongue! In a 
matter of minutes the entire ship 
was watching. 

“He’s your friend, Dr. Kissin- 
ger.” Johnny Rasmussen used the 
intercom, a thing he rarely does. 



“I suggest you represent us. We 
wouldn’t like to startle him with 
numbers.” 

I was still in my quarters. I 
grinned as I punched the reply 
button. 

“Will do, Johnny. I think you’re 
being unduly careful of his feel- 
ings, though. He knows the score. 
You’re dealing with an intellect 
that, in its way, is as sharp as any- 
body’s aboard this ship. Start 
thinking in those terms.” 

“I’ll try,” Rasmussen said dryly. 

A few minutes later I activated a 
personnel port and strolled out 
across the meadow. The waakan 
watched me come. Behind me, I 
knew, a dozen lasers were trained 
steadily on the big beast. I was 
pretty sure he knew it, too. 

“I thought it would be you,” he 
greeted me. “I must appear rath- 
er frightening to your race.” 

“A little,” I admitted. “Look at 
their side. You’re big, strong — and 
obviously a carnivore. Similar 
forms on our home planet are 
fierce and dangerous.” 

The big fellow rolled to all fours, 
shook himself, stood erect. He 
stretched his great arms wide, 
threw back his heavy head and 
yawned — a long satisfying yawn 
with a terrifying display of yel- 
low fangs. It was no accident that 
he happened to be facing the ship. 

His little black eyes twinkled 
with real amusement. 

“Just to give the watchers some- 
thing to watch,” he said. 



38 



GALAXY 




“Be glad,” I said, “that the 
watchers don’t panic easily. There’s 
enough energy trained on you to 
wipe out half this landscape.” 

The waakan sat on his haunches 
again. 

“I’ve never doubted it,” he said 
soberly. “That display w'as a lit- 
tle stupid. I imagine 1 depended 
on the fact that you were protec- 
tion. I’m sure you’ve prepared 
them for me.” 

“If not, you have.” 1 grinned as I 
tapped the small communicator 
unit on my belt. “This is a sound 
transfer device. Everyone on the 
ship hears us perfectly.” 

“A mechanical communica- 
tor?” The waakan peered at the 
small unit with interest. “Clever. 
I deduce that this is necessary for 
you species. You don’t, then, com- 
municate mentally?” 

“Not effectively. We may 
have latent ability, but we’ve 
never developed it.” I turned and 
gestured toward the starship. 
“Dr. Johannes Rasmussen is the 
director of our activities, the co- 
ordinator of what we do. He is 
watching. Would you care to 
speak to him?” 

I could feel the serious gracious- 
ness of the waakan. 

“Dr. Rasmussen,” he said po- 
litely. “It will be a pleasure to 
touch minds with you. During this 
small time we have watched the 
work of your people — and we are 
not displeased. You are superior 
beings. We will help you learn and 



will hope to learn from you as well. 
Is this reasonable?” 

“Very reasonable. We do thank 
you. Dr. Kissinger will bring you 
on board the Stardust , if you will 
come.” 

The waakan rolled back his lips 
in that frightening grin. 

“Later, perhaps. I am more 
comfortable out here with plants 
around me and the sun’s rays on 
me. Remember that I, too, have 
adjustments to make. We have 
speculated on advanced cultures 
on other worlds, but the reality 
requires getting used to. I think 
you understand this.” 

“Perfectly,” Rasmussen assured 
him. “I’ll come out to you.” 

I WON’T detail the events of 
those data-gathering weeks on 
Gossoon. But the waakan cooper- 
ated and, as he had said, we both 
learned. We did indeed. We 
learned a lot. 

We learned, for instance, that 
the continual use of “we” by the 
waakan was neither editorial 
nor, as Mark Twain remarked 
centuries ago, a use permissible 
when a man had a tapeworm. The 
waakan was a unit in a telepathic 
network that included — or could 
include in time of need — every 
member of his race. Let me quali- 
fy that. His telepathic participa- 
tion was at his own option. Any 
individual had a fairly limited 
practical range and usually 
communicated directly only 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



39 




with waakan on adjacent terri- 
tories. 

But by a sort of pass-it-on tech- 
nique news could spread with 
amazing speed. Messages could 
be sent, too, from specialist to 
specialist via the minds of inter- 
vening waakan whose concerns 
might be entirely different. This 
depended, of course, on the avail- 
ability and good humor of the 
waakan involved. Even in tele- 
pathy one could get a busy signal. 

Still, this made their isolated 
living habit more practical. 
They could be together without 
being together, if you follow. 

I made good use of such time as 
remained. During those pleasant 
summer days I roamed a study 
area, a hundred-mile section 
around the spaceship. Lindy had 
her own work now, so 1 was usu- 
ally alone. 1 traveled by jumper. I 
came to know the territories of 
twenty waakan and to be welcome 
in twenty rock houses. And the ma- 
chinery, the equipment, the com- 
plicated apparatus in each 
house — even to list them would be 
both confusing and pointless 
here. They are of record. (ISC 
Annals, Vols. 79-80-81, A. D. 
2121. The Log of the Stardust. 

Occasionally Pegleg joined me. 
Then we used his jeep and rode at 
ease over the sometimes rough ter- 
rain. But he was never comforta- 
ble with the big Dominants. His 
first impression bade fair to be 
pretty lasting. 



“Creatures that understand the 
. movements of the galaxy and yet 
don’t know cookery — creatures 
that can quote the substance of 
Avogadro’s Law and yet have no 
names — This is a mixed-up world, 
Roscoe." 

“ 'Only the lower forms have 
names.’ ” I quoted our resident 
waakan. “Actually, the waakan 
don’t need them. Apparently 
each has his or her own mental 
signal, his own telepathic identi- 
ty. They can’t be verbalized, so 
we’re handicapped. But they’re 
not.” 

This day Pegleg was expertly 
wheeling the jeep into a long de- 
tour across the prairie, mainly to 
avoid stampeding a small herd of 
vada in the middle distance. It 
was important to each waakan’s 
survival that his food supply not 
wander. So we tried to be as con- 
siderate as we could. 

“Captain Jules is bringing in the 
waakan ship,” I remarked. “John- 
ny's all squared away with the 
fuzzy space boys. They’ll set it 
down in the builder’s territory 
and all interested parties can 
check it over at leisure.” 

The ship had been in orbit for 
more than two weeks while Star- 
dust engineers conferred with the 
waakan who were concerned with 
space. And they weren’t many. Our 
thinking there had been far too 
broad, far too comprehensive. 

“How fourteen bears could build 
a spaceship, solve basic problems 



40 



GALAXY 




and actually launch it 1 still don’t 
see,” Pegleg grumbled. 

We had made it around the vada, 
which stood in a tight clump, heads 
up, watching us. 

“They aren’t bears,” 1 re- 
minded, “and it wasn’t one space- 
ship. It was three. Two waakan had 
already sickened in high orbit 
before our friend in the specimen 
lockers took his trip. The orbit- 
ing ships were brought down safe- 
ly by their dying pilots.” 

“I know. I’ve seen them,” Peg- 
leg said. “Carbons of the one that 
gave us our anxious moments. 
But why did our boy take off for 
the next planet when his kind 
couldn’t even stay alive in orbit?” 

“They hypothesized that the 
orbiting was lethal. Why, 1 don’t 
know. They were wrong, of course. 
Apparently he died exactly like 
the others.” 

“They’ve got a problem,” Peg- 
leg said. “1 don’t really see why 
they bother. They don’t need 
space.” 

Later, when I had conversation 
with our waakan (in my notes he 
was Waakan Alpha) on the point, 
his attitude was remarkably 
similar to Pegleg’s. 

“Your story of our pilot's dying 
is one we knew before,” the 
waakan said. “Many of us have 
concluded that waakan cannot 
live in space. Our instincts have 
been sound. We should stay in the 
surroundings and under the con- 
ditions that produced us.” 



“I don’t agree,” I objected. “It’s 
simply a problem. Find the diffi- 
culty. Work on it. Solve it. That’s 
the Earthman’s way.” 

The waakan grinned his grin but 
I no longer found it terrifying. 

“We are waakan,” he said, “and 
I think I am glad of that. Your 
temperament is not ours. We en- 
joy living. You enjoy overcom- 
ing.” 

“A grain of truth," I admitted. 
“But you are overlooking some 
things. We enjoy as much as you. 
You’ve watched Lindy. Do you 
have a happier being on Gos- 
soon?” 

“She is happy, I grant, but still 
she is driven. She has taken our 
space problem to herself.” He 
twitched his ears, rolled his small 
eyes and grinned. “Did you think 
that I didn’t know?” 

“It’s her concern,” I said. “Just 
as physics and mechanics are 
yours. It is to her what your wheels 
and balances and weights are to 
you. You are new life forms to us. 
You have new microforms on 
you. It’s her training to be chal- 
lenged. That’s the interest she 
has.” 

The waakan rose to his full 
towering height and reflectively 
rubbed his back against a tree. 

“I have given her my skin, my 
hair, my saliva, my excretions 
and my blood,” he said. “I have 
contributed much to her plea- 
sure.” 

“You’ll be repaid,” I assured

41 




him. “She’ll tell you what she 
learns.” 

“If she feels that it is right that I 
should know,” said the waakan 
shrewdly. “I expect nothing. 
And 1 should not be content if an 
off-world being discovered my 
weaknesses through superior 
technology. We do have pride, 
you know.” 

“Don’t anticipate,” I advised. 
“So far she has found nothing to 
tell." 



I HAD hardly noticed, but the 
mild and pleasant summer was 
at an end. The golden vegetation 
was turning brown. The breeze 
that blew across the stretches of 
grassland where the vada grazed 
now had a sting to it. I no longer 
went around stripped to the waist. 
A light vest was comfortable. I 
replaced sandals with shoes. 

And the obits were flocking. I 
was never out of hearing of their 
plaintive calls. 

“They dread the migration,” 
Lindy reported. “It’s a risky 
business even for strong fliers. 
There are long stretches without 
good food trees. Many of those lit- 
tle fellows that go south this fall 
won’t be back in the spring.” 

“Pegleg won’t miss them,” I 
said. “La-ling has almost brought 
geology in this neck of the woods 
to a complete standstill. It’s hard 
even to collect specimens from a 
ledge when a little human-type 



butterfly is swooping around 
your head and almost getting hit 
by the hammer.” 

“Poor little thing,” said Lindy. 
“She has a real problem now. She 
knows she isn’t human, but she 
still thinks Pegleg is an obit. She’s 
trying to get him to migrate. She 
insists he could grow wings if he 
really tried.” 

We were on one of our last 
walks, strolling along the stream 
near the first marat’s pool. Obits 
from farther north were drifting 
into the trees. Their sweet high 
voices formed a musical clamor 
as they made deep inroads on the 
remaining hanging fruits. They 
ate anything that ripened, from 
tiny button-like berries to the 
plum -fruits in the thickets favored 
by the waakan. It was in autumn 
that the waakan tasted obit, for the 
hungry little beings swarmed 
wherever there was food. I had per- 
suaded our host waakan to forego 
these delicacies this flocking 
time. To my surprise, he had been 
easy to persuade. 

“Your woman would be un- 
happy,” he had said, “and this 
seems to be important to you. 
Also,” he added slyly, “she re- 
searches our space problem. I 
wouldn’t wish to interfere with 
that.” 

So we “bird-watched” as we 
strolled, enjoying the endless 
variety and color of the tiny 
graceful people that were not peo- 
ple at all. On this planet the true 



42 



GALAXY 




people were huge and black and 
furry, with small black eyes and 
great yellow fangs. 

Lindy put her hand on my arm. 
Ahead, on a sandy stretch of 
stream bank in the sun, Pegleg sat. 
La-ling perched on his shoulder. 
She stroked his ear and lovingly 
nuzzled his hair. The debate was 
still on. We were in plain sight, but 
we were not noticed, so we lis- 
tened. Technically, as Lindy 
pointed out later, we were not 
snooping. 

“You must go, La-ling,” Pegleg 
was saying. “If you wait any long- 
er the flocks before you will eat all 
the fruit. You yourself told me 
that late migrants often starve.” 

“If you stay here the cold will get 
you,” La-ling insisted. “An obit 
cannot live in the snow.” 

“Look at me,” Pegleg said pa- 
tiently. “I am many times larger 
than you. I have no wings. 1 am not 
an obit. 1 am a man, a creature 
you never saw before this sum- 
mer. You’ve seen many of us since. 
So why do you insist I am like 
you?” 

“You are beautiful,” little La- 
ling said. “We could migrate and 
have a nest together.” 

“She’s dreaming the Impossi- 
ble Dream,” Lindy murmured in 
my ear. 

“The snow won’t harm me,” 
Pegleg said. “I don’t have to live 
on fruits. I can stay here as well as 
the waakan can.” 

“You do not wish me in your 



nest,” the little obit said petu- 
lantly. “You are wiser than even 
the brutes of waakan and you 
could make me large — or you 
could make yourself small. You 
simply do not choose.” 

Pegleg looked baffled. The tiny 
woman-thing sounded so like the 
full-sized variety that it must have 
made him homesick. Then he 
seemed to have an inspiration. 

“I would be most unsatisfac- 
tory. See, I come apart!” He swift- 
ly disengaged the magnetic fasten- 
ings of his plastic knee and laid the 
leg aside. 

The little obit lifted gently 
from his shoulder and hovered, 
her beautiful wings waving slow- 
ly. She clapped her tiny hands with 
delight. 

“Oh, lovely! Now remove your 
head!” 

That broke him up. Lindy and I 
clasped hands and choked with si- 
lent laughter while Pegleg’s 
shoulders shook. 

“No more,” he gasped finally. 
“If I removed my head I could not 
watch you — and who knows what 
you would do? No, you must go 
now. Rest and fly early tomor- 
row. See, I have brought you a gift. 
You’ll never have one sweeter.” 

He took a small red apple from 
his pouch. The little obit clasped it 
with both small hands and sniffed it 
greedily. 

“You do like me! You wish me 
to go, so that when I come back in 
spring we can have a nest togeth- 



BIRDS FLY SOUTH IN WINTER 



43 




er. Although,” she added, “I think 
you will freeze.” 

And with that cheery pro- 
nouncement she spread her wings 
wide and swept higher and higher 
in an ever-expanding spiral, the 
precious apple held tightly 
against her small body. In a mo- 
ment she was a tiny speck against 
the evening sky. Pegleg was so- 
ber again as he snapped his leg in- 
to place. 

T HE next day the trees were 
empty. The flocks of obits had 
moved out at first light, winging 
steadily southward like swallows 
on Earth. And the yellow sun’s 
rays had a cold glint. The wind 
quartered toward the north. 

“The waakan are shedding 
fast,” I reported. “Have you no- 
ticed?” Pegleg had joined Lindy 
and me as we sat on a jumper plat- 
form in the pale sunshine. 
“They’re growing new, thicker 
coats — and they’ll be snow white. 
They like this, apparently. 
They’re looking forward to it. 
Winter is a favorite time of 
year.” 

“Quoting Alpha, I take it,” 
Pegleg said. 

“Quoting a number of them. 
I’ve been getting around, you 
know. Grizzly country will be- 
come polar bear country. But the 
vada winter well on cured vegeta- 
tion — and the waakan keep busy. 
And winter has another attrac- 
tion.” 



“I suppose I must ask,” Pegleg 
said. “Consider it done.” 

“Winter is their Time of 
Joy — their mating season. Just 
for a little time science takes a 
back seat. Nobody’s solitary and 
Mother Nature takes over.” 

“Time of Joy,” Lindy said gent- 
ly. “I like that. I think that is very 
nicely put. They are superior 
creatures, after all.” 

“And when you find out why 
they die in space they can lake their 
wisdom to the other planets of 
their system — and eventually to the 
stars.” Pegleg’s sarcasm is built 
in. He doesn’t mean it as it sounds, 
but you have to know him to toler- 
ate it. 

“I know how they die,” Lindy 
said quietly. “It wasn’t a very big 
problem. And 1 don’t think they 
want to take their wisdom to the 
stars. They’re not explorers or 
crusaders. They want to go on ex- 
actly the way they are, learning 
only for the sake of knowing. 
They don’t really want to travel 
anywhere.” 

“So you don’t plan to tell them 
how they die?” 

She shrugged. 

“I couldn’t if I wanted to. ISC 
rules would not let me. When I was 
sure I talked to Johnny. He 
agrees. They must develop their 
own space initiative, meet their 
own challenges. Not until they’ve 
done so can they compete with 
other civilizations, other cul- 
tures. Now they don’t even inter- 



44 



GALAXY 




act with the dominant species on 
their own borders.” 

“They adjusted to us,” Pegleg 
said. 

“We haven’t disturbed their life 
patterns. We came to them. They 
recognized our technological 
achievements and admire us for 
them. But they’ll be glad when 
we’re gone.” 

Lindy leaned back comfortably 
against my shoulder. 1 put an arm 
around her waist and she locked 
her fingers with mine. 

> ‘I won’t tel! anybody,” 1 said, 
“and Pegleg is, appropriately, 
as deaf as a stone. Why do the 
waakan die in space?” 

Lindy sighed. 

“Such a simple thing! They 
have on their fur a little protist, a 
bacterium-like organism that 
lives on grease and sweat. Perfect- 
ly harmless and normal. Every 
skin has a saprobe population. 
But in space something happens 
to their variety, something prob- 
ably related to radiation. It be- 
comes a virulent parasite, chang- 
ing form and migrating through 
the skin into nerve tissues and on 
to the brain, multiplying enor- 
mously as it goes. It immobil- 
izes brain cells, making them in- 
sensitive, quiescent. The af- 
fected creature doesn’t suffer. It 
simply lies down quietly and fi- 
nally sleeps. Never to awaken — 
you see?” 

“Wouldn’t it help to give them at 
least a clue?” Pegleg asked. He 



didn’t question Lindy’s data. He 
knew she knew. 

“Interference,” I reminded him. 
“International Space Council 
rule, as she said. And the most ba- 
sic one in the mandate by which 
we operate. We can advise, but 
not provide information. You 
know that.” 

Pegleg nodded. 

“Right. It’s up to them.” 

“In a way, this is the nice time 
of their history,” Lindy mused. 
“The satisfying, predictable log of 
the seasons. When snow flies they’ll 
be happy in their thick white coats, 
happy in their Time of Joy. Spring 
will come. The marats will emerge 
from hibernation. The obits will 
come back from the south. There 
will be new foliage on the trees, 
new grass for the vada, new blos- 
soms and new fruit. There will be 
more food and learning and plea- 
sure. Is there much else? What’s 
life about, anyway?” 

“They need maturing time.” I 
took it up. “They’ll progress, 
slowly. Perhaps by the time they 
conquer their space sickness — and 
develop better fuels and more effi- 
cient drives-Hthey’ll be more near- 
ly ready to reach out toward the 
expanding cultures of Earth and, I 
doubt not, worlds we still don’t 
know.” 

“It'll take millennia,” Pegleg 
said. 

“So far as I know, therCs no 
hurry,” I said. “They have all the 
time there is.” ★

Now if the lad were willing 
to buck the establishment and 
could find a patch of soil . 



A. LENTINI 



I SAW my first tree today. Dad 
finally broke down and took us 
to East Boston Urban Center 3 
after Mom' had been harping on it 
for the past two weeks. I think he 
was glad we went after all because 
he was smiling quietly all during 
the trip back. 

Dad used to tell me stories about 
the trees that still existed when he 
was a boy. There weren't very 
many even then, with the 
Urbanization Program in full 
swing, but most people had seen at 
least one tree by the time they 
started school. It wasn’t like nowa- 
days, at any rate. Oh, I’ve seen the 
plastic trees; practically every 
street has a Tew of them. But you 
can tell the plastic ones are arti- 
ficial just from looking at pic- 
tures in the microdot library. And 
now, after seeing a real tree, I can 
say for sure that the artificial ones 
aren’t the same at all. 

This morning when we got up the 
house was all excited. Mom dialed 
a light breakfast of toast and 
synthetic milk so that we wouldn't 
waste time eating. And when we 
finished the three of us took an 
elevator-bus up to the fourth level, 
where we caught the air track to 



Brooklyn. From there we took an- 
other elevator-bus down to main 
level, rode the monorail to Inter- 
city Subway Station 27, and 
caught the second sublevel AA 
train to Boston. Our expectations 
were so high that Dad and I didn’t 
mind it when Mom told us again 
how the tree was discovered. 

The O'Brien home was one of 
the few examples of old-style 
wooden structures that hadn’t 
been demolished in Boston's urban 
renewal campaign at the turn of 
the century. The family had been 
able to avoid this because of its 
wealth and political influence and 
the house was passed on through 
several generations to the present. 
Old man O’Brien had no heirs, so 
when he died the family home went 
up for auction and the Urban 
Center bought it. When local offi- 
cials arrived for an appraisal they 
discovered that the house had a 
back yard, which is forbidden by 
zoning restrictions. 

In the yard was a live tree — an 
oke was what Mom called it. 

When the news of the tree’s dis- 
covery leaked out quite a few sight- 
seers stopped by to have a look at it 
and the local government, realiz- 



47 




ing the money-making potential, 
began charging admission and 
advertising the place. By now it 
had become a favorite spot for 
school field trips and family excur- 
sions such as ours. 

When we arrived in main Bos- 
ton we rode the elevator-bus up to 
ground level and caught a mono- 
rail out to East Boston Urban 
Center 3. An air-cush taxi took us 
the rest of the way to the resi- 
dence. 

The home itself was unimpres- 
sive. It had none of the marble 
gloss or steely sheen of modern 
buildings, but was rather a dull 
white color, with the paint peeling 
in places. Dad paid the admission 
fee and we spent the next fifteen 
minutes on a dull guided tour of 
the house. The rooms were roped 
off to keep people from touching 
anything, but there were no win- 
dows facing the illegal back yard 
anyway, so it really didn’t matter 
that I couldn’t enter the rooms on 
that side. 

My mind was on the tree and I 
thought the inside tour would never 
end, but soon we were walking 
through a doorway hidden in one 
of the bookshelves and into the 
back yard. The yard was big — at 
least ten by twenty feet — and I 
was surprised to find real grass 
growing on the sides of the con- 
crete walkway built for tourists. 
The grass didn’t distract me for 
long, however, because I just 
couldn’t help noticing the tree! 



It was located at one end of the 
yard and there was a mesh fence 
around it for protection. It was 
similar in form to the plastic trees 
I’d seen, but there was much more 
to it than that. You could see de- 
tails more intricate than in any 
man-made plant. And it was alive. 
Long ago someone had carved 
their initials in the bark and you 
could see where the wound had 
healed. But best of all was the 
smell. It was a fresh, living odor, 
alien to the septic world outside 
with all its metal, plastic and glass. 
I wanted to touch the bark, but the 
fence prevented me from doing 
so. Mom and Dad just breathed 
deeply and stared up with smiles 
on their faces. The three of us stood 
there for a moment and then the 
tour guide told us to make room 
for the next group. I didn’t want to 
go — in fact, I almost felt like cry- 
ing. 

On the way back Mom and Dad 
were silent and I read through one 
of the brochures the guide had 
passed out. When I came to the 
part that said the O’Brien home 
would be open only for the rest of 
this year I was sad. They intend to 
tear down the place to make room 
for some kind of insurance build- 
ing and the tree will have to go, 
too. 

For the rest of the trip I just sat 
still, fingering the object in my 
pocket which I had picked off the 
grass in the O’Brien’s back yard. I 
think it’s called an acorn. -fa

O NCE there was a dead man. cancer all through his frozen body. 

He had been waiting for two He had had it bad. 
hundred years inside a coffin He was waiting for medical sci- 
whose outer shell held liquid nitro- ence to find him a cure, 
gen. There were frozen clumps of He waited in vain. Most vari- 



50 



eties of cancer could be cured now, 
but no cure existed for the billions 
of cell walls ruptured by expand- 
ing crystals of ice. He had known 
the risk when he took it and had 
gambled anyway. Why not? He 
had been dying. 

The vaults held millions of 
frozen bodies. Why not? They too, 
had been dying. 

L ATER there was a criminal. 

His name is forgotten and his 
crime is secret, but it must have 
been a terrible one. The State 
wiped his personality for it. 

Afterward he was a dead man: 
still warm, still breathing, even 
reasonably healthy-p*;but empty. 

The State had use for an empty 
man. 

C ORBETT awoke on a hard ta- 
ble, aching as if he had slept too 
long in one position. He stared in- 
curiously at a white ceiling. 
Memories floated back to him of a 
double-walled coffin and sleep and 
pain. 

The pain was gone. 

He sat up at once. 

And flapped his arms wildly for 
balance. Everything felt wrong. His 
arms would not swing right. His 
body was too light. His head 
bobbed strangely on a thin neck. 
He reached frantically for the 
nearest support, which turned out 
to be a blond young man in a white 
jumpsuit. Corbett missed — his 
arms were shorter than he had ex- 



pected. He toppled to his side, 
shook his head and sat up more 
carefully. 

His arms. Scrawny, knobby — 
and not his. 

The man in the jumpsuit asked, 
“Are you all right?” 

“Yah,” said Corbett. His throat 
was rusty, but that was all right. 
His new body didn’t fit, but it 
didn’t seem to have cancer, either. 
“What’s the date? How long has it 
been?” 

A quick recovery. The checker 
gave him a plus. “Twenty-one 
ninety, your dating. You won’t 
have to worry about our dating.” 

That sounded ominous. Cau- 
tiously Corbett postponed the ob- 
vious question: What's happened 
to me? and asked instead, “Why 
not?” 

“You won’t be joining our so- 
ciety.” 

“No? What, then?" 

“Several professions are open to 
you — a limited choice. If you don’t 
qualify for any of them we’ll try 
someone else." 

Corbett sat on the edge of the 
hard operating table. His body 
seemed younger, more limber, 
definitely thinner. He was acutely 
aware that his abdomen did not 
hurt no matter how he moved. 

He asked, “And what happens to 
me?” 

“I’ve never learned how to 
answer that question. Call it a mat- 
ter of metaphysics,” said the 
checker. “Let me detail what’s 



RAMMER

happened to you so far and then 
you can decide for yourself.” 

T HERE was an empty man. Still 
breathing and as healthy as 
most of society in the year twenty- 
one ninety. But empty. The elec- 
trical patterns in the brain, the 
worn paths of nervous reflexes, 
the memories, the personality of 
the man had all been wiped away. 
And there was this frozen thing. 
“Your newstapers called you 
people corpsicles,” said the blond 
man. “1 never understood what 
the tapes meant.” 

“It comes from popsicle. Frozen 
sherbet.” Corbett had used the 
word himself before he had be- 
come one of them. One of the corp- 
sicles, frozen dead. 

Frozen within a corpsicle’s 
frozen brain were electrical pat- 
terns that could be recorded. The 
process would warm the brain and 
destroy most of the patterns, but 
that hardly mattered, because 
other things must be done too. 

Personality was not all in the 
brain. Memory RNA was concen- 
trated in the brain but it ran all 
through the nerves and the blood. 
In Corbett’s case the clumps of 
cancer had to be cut away — then 
the RNA could be extracted from 
what was left. The operation 
would have left nothing like a 
human being. More like bloody 
mush, Corbett gathered. 

“What’s been done to you is not 
the kind of thing we can do twice,” 



said the checker. “You get one 
chance and this is it. If you don’t 
work out we’ll terminate and try 
someone else. The vaults are full 
of corpsicles.” 

“You mean you’d wipe my per- 
sonality,” Corbett said un- 
steadily. “But I haven’t com- 
mitted a crime. Don’t I have any 
rights?” 

The checker looked stunned. 
Then he laughed. “I thought I’d ex- 
plained. The man you think you 
are is dead. Corbett’s will was 
probated long ago. His widow — ” 

“Damn it, I left money to my- 
self! A trust fund!” 

“No good.” Though the man 
still smiled, his face was 
impersonal, remote, unreach- 
able. A vet smiles reassuringly at 
a cat due to be fixed. “A dead man 
can’t own property — that was set- 
tled in the courts long ago. It 
wasn’t fair to the heirs. It took the 
money out of circulation.” 

Corbett jerked an unexpectedly 
bony thumb at his bony chest. “But 
I’m alive now ” 

“Not in law. You can earn your 
new life; the State will give you a 
new birth certificate and citizen- 
ship if you give the State good rea- 
son.” 

Corbett sat for a moment, ab- 
sorbing that. Then he got off the 
table. “Let’s get started then. 
What do you need to know about 
me?” 

“Your name.” 

“Jerome Corbett.”

“Call me Pierce.” The checker 
did not offer to shake hands. 
Neither did Corbett, perhaps be- 
cause he sensed the man would not 
respond, perhaps because they 
were both noticeably overdue for 
a bath. “I’m your checker. Do you 
like people? I’m just asking. We’ll 
lest you in detail later.” 

“I get along with the people 
around me but I like my privacy.” 
The checker frowned. “That nar- 
rows it more than you might think. 
This isolationism you called 
privacy was, well, a passing fad. 
We don’t have the room for it — or 
the inclination either. We can’t 
send you to a colony world — ” 

“I might make a good colonist.” 
“You’d make terrible breeding 
stock. Remember, the genes aren’t 
yours. No. You get one choice, 
Corbett. Rammer.” 

“Rammer?” 

“ ’Fraid so.” 

“That’s the first strange word 
you’ve used since I woke up. In 
fact — hasn’t the language changed 
at all? You don’t even have an ac- 
cent.” 

“Part of the job. I learned your 
speech through RNA training. 
You’ll learn your trade the same 
way if you get that far. You’ll be 
amazed how fast you can learn 
with RNA shots to help you along. 
But you’d better be right about 
liking your privacy, Corbett. Can 
you take orders?” 

“I was in the army.” 

“What does that mean?” 



“Yes.” 

“Good. Do you like strange 
places and faraway people — or 
vice versa?” 

“Both.” Corbett smiled hope- 
fully. “I’ve raised buildings all 
over the world. Can the world use 
another architect?” 

“No. Do you feel that the State 
owes you something?” 

There could be but one answer to 
that. “No.” 

“But you had yourself frozen. 
You must have felt that the future 
owed you something.” 

“Not at all. It was a good risk. I 
was dying.” 

“Ah.” The checker looked him 
over thoughtfully. “If you had 
something to believe in, perhaps 
dying wouldn’t mean so much.” 
Corbett said nothing. 

T HEY gave him a short word-as- 
sociation test in English. The 
test made Corbett suspect that a 
good many corpsicles must date 
from near his own death. They 
took a blood sample, then exer- 
cised Corbett to exhaustion on a 
treadmill and took another blood 
sample. They tested his pain 
threshhold by direct nerve 
stimulation?— excruciatingly un- 
pleasant — and took another blood 
sample. They gave him a Chinese 
puzzle and told him to take it 
apart. 

Pierce then informed him that 
the testing was over. 



RAMMER 



53 




“After all, we already know the- 
state of your health.” 

“Then why the blood samples?” 
The checker looked at him for a 
moment. “You tell me.” 

Something about that look gave 
Corbett the creepy feeling that he 
was on trial for his life. The feel- 
ing might have been caused only 
by the checker’s rather narrow fea- 
tures, his icy blue gaze and ab- 
stracted smile. Still — Pierce had 
stayed with him all through the 
testing, watching him as if Cor- 
bett’s behavior were a reflection 
on Pierce’s judgment. Corbett 
thought carefully before he 
spoke. 

“You have to know how far I’ll 
go before I quit. You can analyze 
the blood samples for adrenalin 
and fatigue poisons to find out just 
how much 1 was hurting, just how 
tired I really was.” 

“That’s right,” said the check- 
er. 

Corbett had survived again. 

He would have given up much 
earlier on the pain test. But at some 
point Pierce had mentioned that 
Corbett was the fourth corpsicle 
personality to be tested in that 
empty body. 

H E REMEMBERED going to 
sleep that last time, two hun- 
dred years ago. 

His family and friends had been 
all around him, acting like 
mourners. He had chosen the cof- 
fin, paid for vault space and made 



out his Last Will and Testament, 
but he had not thought of the hap- 
pening as dying. It had not felt 
like dying. He had been given a 
shot. The eternal pain had drifted 
away in a soft haze. He had gone 
to sleep. 

He had done so wondering about 
the future, wondering what he 
would wake to. A vault into the 
unknown. World government? 
Interplanetary spacecraft? Clean 
fusion power? Strange clothing, 
body paints, nudism? 

Or crowding, poverty, all the 
fuels used up, power provided by 
cheap labor? He had thought of 
those, but it was all right. They 
would not be able to afford to 
wake him if they were that poor. 
The world he dreamed of in those 
last moments was a rich world, 
able to support such luxuries as 
Jerome Corbett. 

It looked as if he weren’t going 
to see too damn much of it. 

A guard led Corbett away after 
the testing. He walked with a 
meaty hand wrapped around Cor- 
bett’s thin upper arm. Leg irons 
would have been no more effective 
had Corbett thought of escaping. 
The guard took him up a narrow 
plastic staircase to the roof. 

The noon sun blazed in a blue 
sky that shaded to yellow, then 
brown at the horizon. Green 
plants grew in close-packed rows 
on parts of the roof. Elsewhere 
many sheets of something glassy 
were exposed to the sunlight. 



54 



GALAXY 




Corbett caught one glimpse of 
the world from a bridge between 
two roofs. It was a cityscape of 
close-packed buildings, all of the 
same cold cubistic design. Corbett 
was impossibly high on a walk 
that was concrete, to be sure, but 
that had no guard rails at all. So 
Corbett stopped breathing, 
slopped walking. 

The guard did not speak. He 
lugged at Corbett’s arm, not hard, 
and watched to see what he would 
do. Corbett pulled himself to- 
gether and walked on. 

T HE room was all bunks — two 
walls of bunks with a gap be- 
tween. The light was cool and arti- 
ficial, but outside it was nearly 
noon. Could they be expecting 
him to sleep? 

The room was big, a thousand 
bunks big. Most of the bunks were 
full. A few occupants watched in- 
curiously as the guard showed Cor- 
bett which bunk was his. It was the 
bottommost in a stack of six. 
Corbett had to drop to his knees 
and roll to get into it. The bed- 
clothes were strange, silky and very 
smooth, even slippery — the only 
touch of luxury in that place. But 
there was no top sheet, nothing to 
cover him. He lay on his side, look- 
ing out at the dormitory from near 
floor level. 

Three things were shocking 
about that place. 

One was the smell. Apparently 
perfumes and deodorants had been 



another passing fad. Pierce had 
been overdue for a bath. So was 
Corbett’s new self. Here the smell 
was rich. 

The second was the double 
bunks, four of them in a vertical 
stack, wider than the singles and 
with thicker mattresses. The 
doubles were for loving, not sleep- 
ing. What shocked Corbett was 
that they were right out in the 
open, not hidden by so much as a 
gauze curtain. 

The same was true of the toilets. 

How can they live like this ? 

Corbett rubbed his nose and 
jumped — and cursed at himself for 
jumping. It was the third time he 
had done so. His own nose had 
been big and fleshy and somewhat 
shapeless. But the nose he now 
rubbed automatically when try- 
ing to think was small and narrow 
with a straight, sharp edge. He 
might very well get used to the 
smell and everything else before 
he got used to his own nose. 

Some time after dusk a man 
came for him. A broad, brawny 
type wearing a gray jumper and a 
broad expressionless face, the 
guard was not one to waste words. 
He found Corbett’s bunk, pulled 
Corbett out by one arm and led 
him stumbling away. Corbett was 
facing Pierce before he was fully 
awake. 

In annoyance he asked, “Doesn’t 
anyone else speak English?” 

“No,” said the checker. 

Pierce and the guard guided Cor- 



RAMAAER 



55 




bett to a comfortable armchair 
facing a wide curved screen. They 
put padded earphones on him. 
They set a plastic bottle of clear 
fluid on a shelf over his head. Cor- 
bett noticed a clear plastic tube 
tipped with a hypodermic needle. 
“Breakfast?” 

Pierce missed the sarcasm. “One 
meal each day — after learning 
period and exercise.” He inserted 
the hypodermic into a vein in 
Corbett’s arm. He covered the 
wound with a blob of what might 
have been silly putty. 

Corbett watched it all without 
emotion. If he had ever been 
afraid of needles the months of 
pain and cancer had worked it out 
of him. A needle was surcease, 
freedom from pain for a time. 

“Learn now,” said Pierce. “This 
knob controls speed. The volume is 
set for your hearing. You may re- 
play any section once. Don’t 
worry about your arm — you can’t 
pull the tube loose/’ 

“There’s something 1 wanted to 
ask you, only I couldn’t remember 
the word. What’s a rammer?” 
“Starship pilot.” 

Corbett studied the checker’s 
face. “You’re kidding.” 

“No. Learn now.” The checker 
turned on Corbett’s screen and 
went away. 

II 

A RAMMER was the pilot of a 
starship. 



The starships were Bussard ram- 
jets. They caught interstellar 
hydrogen in immaterial nets of 
electromagnetic force, guided and 
compressed and burned the hydro- 
gen for thrust. Potentially there 
was no limit at all on their speed. 
They were enormously powerful, 
enormously complex, enormous- 
ly expensive. 

Corbett found it incredible that 
the State would trust so much 
value, such devastating power 
and mass to one man. To a man 
two centuries dead! Why, Corbett 
was an architect, not an astro- 
naut. It was news to him that the 
concept of the Bussard ramjet 
predated his own death. He had 
watched the Apollo XI and XIII 
flights on television and that had 
been the extent of his interest in 
spaceflight until now. 

Now his life depended on his 
“rammer” career. He never 
doubted it. That was what kept 
Corbett in front of the screen with 
the earphones on his head for 
fourteen hours that first day. He 
was afraid he might be tested. 

He didn’t understand all he was 
supposed to learn. But he was not 
tested either. 

The second day he began to get 
interested. By the third day he was 
fascinated. Things he had never un- 
derstood — relativity and magnetic 
theory and abstract mathematics 
— he now grasped intuitively. It 
was marvelous! 

And he ceased to wonder why 



56 



GALAXY 




the State had chosen Jerome Cor- 
bett. It was always done this way. 
It made sense, all kinds of sense. 

The payload of a starship was 
small and its operating lifetime 
was more than a man’s lifetime. A 
reasonably safe life-support 
system for one man occupied an 
unreasonably high proportion 
of the payload. The rest must go 
for biological package probes. 

As for sending a citizen, a loyal 
member of the State — what for? 
The times would change enor- 
mously before a starship could re- 
turn. The State itself might change 
beyond recognition. A returning 
rammer must adjust to a whole 
new culture^with no way of tell- 
ing in advance what it might be 
like. 

Why not pick a man who had al- 
ready chosen to adjust to a new 
culture? A man whose own cul- 
ture was two centuries dead be- 
fore the trip started? 

And a man who already owed 
the State his life? 

The RNA was most effective. 
Corbett stopped wondering about 
Pierce’s dispassionately posses- 
sive attitude. He began to think 
of himself as property being 
programed for a purpose. 

And he learned. He skimmed 
microtaped texts as if they were 
already familiar. The process was 
heady. He became convinced that 
he could rebuild a ramship with 
his bare hands, given the parts. He 
had loved figures all his life, but ab- 



stract mathematics had been be- 
yond him until now. Field theory, 
monopole field equations, cir- 
cuitry design. When to suspect 
the presence of a gravitational 
point “scource”— how to locate 
it, use it, avoid it. 

The teaching chair was his life. 
The rest of his time — exercise, 
dinner, sleep — seemed vague, un- 
interesting. 

E EXERCISED with about 
twenty others in a room too 
small for the purpose. Like Cor- 
bett, the others were lean and 
stringy, in sharp contrast to the 
brawny wedge-shaped men who 
were their guards. They followed 
the lead of a guard, running in 
place because there was no room 
for real running, forming precise 
rows for scissors jumps, pushups, 
situps. 

After fourteen hours in a teach- 
ing chair Corbett usually enjoyed 
the jumping about. He followed 
orders. And he wondered about the 
stick in a holster at the guard’s 
waist. It looked like a cop’s baton. 
It might have been just that^ex- 
cept for the hole in one end. Cor- 
bett never tried to find out. 

Sometimes he saw Pierce dur- 
ing the exercise periods. Pierce 
and the men who tended the teach- 
ing chairs were of a third type: well 
fed, in adequate condition, but 
just on the verge of being over- 
weight. Corbett thought of them 
as Olde American types. 




RAMMER 



57 




From Pierce he learned some- 
thing of the other professions open 
to a revived corpsicle/repro- 
gramed criminal. Stoop labor: in- 
tensive hand cultivation of crops. 
Body servants, handicrafts. And 
easily taught repetitive work. And 
the hours! The corpsicles were ex- 
pected to work fourteen hours a 
day. And the crowding! 

He was leading the life now. 
Fourteen hours to study, an hour 
of heavy exercise, an hour to eat 
and eight hours of sleeping in a 
dorm that was two solid walls of 
people. 

“Time to work, time to eat, time 
to sleep! Elbow to elbow every 
minute! The poor bastards,’’ he 
said to Pierce. “What kind of a life 
is that?” 

“It lets them repay their debt to 
the Slate as quickly as possible. Be 
reasonable, Corbett. What would 
a corpsicle do with his off hours? 
He has no social life — he has to 
learn one by observing citizens. 
Many forms of corpsicle labor in- 
volve proximity to citizens.” 

“So they can look up at their 
betters while they work? That’s no 
way to learn. It would take — I get 
the feeling we’re talking about 
decades of this kind of thing.” 

“Thirty years’ labor generally 
earns a man his birth certificate. 
That gets him a right-to- 
work — which then gets him a 
guaranteed base income he can 
use to buy education tapes and 
shots. And the medical benefits 



are impressive. We live longer 
than you used to, Corbett.” 

“Meanwhile it’s slave labor. 
Anyway, none of this applies to 
me — ” 

“No, of course not. Corbett, 
you’re wrong to call it slave labor. 
A slave can’t quit. You can change 
jobs any time you like. There’s a 
clear freedom of choice.” 

Corbett shivered. “Any slave can 
commit suicide.” 

“Suicide, my ass,” the checker 
said distinctly. If he had anything 
that could be called an accent it 
lay in the precision of his 
pronunciation. “Jerome Corbett 
is dead. I could have given you his 
intact skeleton for a souvenir.” 

“I don’t doubt it.” Corbett saw 
himself tenderly polishing his own 
white bones. But where could he 
have kept such a thing? 

“Well, then. You’re a brain- 
wiped criminal, justly brain-wiped, 
I might add. Your crime has cost 
you your citizenship, but you still 
have the right to change profes- 
sions. You need only ask for an- 
other personality. What slave can 
change jobs at will?” 

“It would feel like dying.” 
“Nonsense. You go to sleep, 
that’s all. When you wake up 
you’ve got a different set of 
memories.” 

The subject was an unpleasant 
one. Corbett avoided it from then 
on. But he could not avoid talking 
to the checker. Pierce was the only 
man in the world he could talk to. 



58 



GALAXY 




On the days Pierce failed to show 
up he felt angry, frustrated. 

Once he asked about gravita- 
tional point scources. “My time 
didn’t know about those.” 

“Yes, it did. Neutron stars. You 
had a number of pulsars located 
by nineteen-seventy and the math 
to describe how a pulsar decays. 
The thing to watch for is a decayed 
pulsar directly in your path.” 

“Oh.” 

Pierce regarded him in some 
amusement. “You really don’t 
know much about your own time, 
do you?” 

“Astrophysics wasn’t my field. 
And we didn’t have your learning 
techniques.” Which reminded 
him of something. “Pierce, you 
said you learned English with 
RNA injections. Where did the 
RNA come from?” 

Pierce grinned and left. 



C ORBETT did not want to die. 

He was utterly, disgustingly 
healthy and twenty years younger 
than he had been at death. He 
found his rammer education con- 
tinually fascinating. If only they 
would stop treating him like 
property . 

Corbett had been in the army, 
but that had been twenty years be- 
fore his' death. He had learned to 
take orders, but never to like it. 
What had galled him then had been 
the basic assumption of his in- 
feriority. But no Army officer in 



Corbett’s experience had be- 
lieved in Corbett’s inferiority as 
completely as did Pierce and 
Pierce’s guards. 

The checker never repeated a 
command, never seemed even to 
consider that Corbett would re- 
fuse. If Corbett refused, once, he 
knew what would happen. And 
Pierce knew that he knew. No 
army could have survived in such a 
state. The attitude better fitted a 
death camp. 

They must think I'm a zom- 
bie . 

Corbett carefully did not pursue 
the thought. He was a corpse 
brought back to life — but not all 
the way. 

The life was not pleasant. His 
last-class citizenship was galling. 
There was nobody to talk to-Hno- 
body but Pierce, whom he was 
learning to hate. He was hungry 
most of the time — the single daily 
meal barely filled his belly and it 
would not stay full. No wonder he 
had wakened so lean. 

More and more he lived in the 
teaching chair. Vicariously he be- 
came a rammer then and the im- 
potence of his life was changed to 
omnipotence. Starman! Riding 
the fire that feeds the suns, scoop- 
ing fuel from interstellar space it- 
self, spreading electromagnetic 
fields like wings hundreds of miles 
out . 

Two weeks after the State had 
wakened him from the dead, Cor- 
bett was given his course. 



RAMMER 



59 




H E relaxed in a chair that was not 
quite a contour couch. RNA 
solution dripped into him. The 
needle no longer bothered 
him — he never noticed it. The 
teaching screen held a map of his 
course, in green lines in three- 
space. Corbett had stopped won- 
dering how the three-dimen- 
sional effect was achieved. 

The scale was shrinking as he 
watched. 

Two tiny blobs and a glowing 
ball surrounded by a faintly glow- 
ing corona. This part of his course 
he already knew. A linear accel- 
erator would launch him from the 
moon, boost him to Bussard ram- 
jet speeds and hurl him at the sun. 
Solar gravity would increase his 
speed while his electromagnetic 
fields caught and, burned the solar 
wind itself. Then out, still accel- 
erating, to the stars . 

In the teaching screen the scale 
shrank horrendously. The dis- 
tances between stars were awe- 
some, terrifying. Van Maanan's 
Star was twelve light-years away. 

He would begin deceleration a 
bit past the midpoint. The match- 
ing would be tricky. He must slow 
enough to release the biological 
package probe — but not enough to 
drop him below ram speeds. In 
addition he must use the mass of 
the star for a course change. 
There was no room for error here. 

Then on to the next target, 
which was even farther away. 
Corbett watched — and he ab- 



sorbed — and a part of him seemed 
to have known everything all 
along even while another part was 
gasping at the distances. Ten 
stars, All yellow dwarfs of the Sol 
type/an average of fifteen light- 
years apart-^-though he would 
cross one gap of fifty-two light- 
years. He would almost touch 
lightspeed on that one. Oddly 
enough, the Bussard ramjet ef- 
fect would improve at such speeds. 
He could take advantage of the 
greater hydrogen flux to pull the 
fields closer to the ship, to in- 
tensify them. 

Ten stars in a closed path, a bad- 
ly bent and battered ring leading 
him back to the solar system and 
Earth. He would benefit from the 
lime he spent near the speed of 
light. Three hundred years would 
pass on Earth, but Corbett would 
only live through two hundred 
years of ship’s lime- which im- 
plied some kind of suspended ani- 
mation technique. 

It didn’t hit him the first time 
through — or the second, but repe- 
tition had been built into the 
teaching program. It didn’t hit 
him until he was on his way to the 
exercise room. 

Three hundred years? 

Three hundred years! 

Ill 

I T wasn’t night, not really. Out- 
side it must be midafternoon.

GALAXY 




Indoors, the dorm was always 
coolly lit, barely brightly enough 
to read if there had been any 
books. There were no windows. 

Corbett should have been asleep. 
He suffered every minute he spent 
gazing out into the dorm. Most of 
the others were asleep, but a cou- 
ple made noisy love on one of the 
loving bunks. A few men lay on 
their backs with their eyes open 
and two women talked in low 
voices. Corbett didn’t know the 
language. He had been unable to 
find anyone who spoke English. 

He suspected that there were two 
shifts, that someone slept in his 
bunk, mornings — but he could 
prove nothing. The slippery 
sheets must be fantastically easy 
to clean. Just hose them down. 

Corbett was desperately home- 
sick. 

The first few days had been the 
worst. 

He had stopped noticing the 
smell. If something reminded him 
he could sniff the traces of bil- 
lions of human beings. Other- 
wise the odor was part of the en- 
vironment. 

But the loving bunks bothered 
him. When they were in use he 
watched. When he forced himself 
not to watch he listened. He 
couldn’t help himself. But he had 
turned down two sign-language in- 
vitations from a small brunette 
with straggly hair and a pretty, el- 
fin face. Make love in public? He 
couldn’t. 



He could avoid using the loving 
bunks, but not the exposed toi- 
lets. That was embarrassing. The 
first time he was able to force him- 
self only by staring rigidly at his 
feet. When he pulled on his jump- 
er and looked up a number of 
sleepers were watching him in ob- 
vious amusement. The reason 
might have been his self-con- 
sciousness or the way he dropped 
his jumper around his ankles or 
he may have been out of line. A 
pecking order determined who 
might use the toilets before 
whom. He still hadn’t figured out 
the details. 

Corbett wanted to go home. 

The idea was unreasonable. 
His home was gone and he would 
have gone with it without the 
corpsicle crypts. But reason was of 
no use in this instance — he wanted 
to go home. Home to Miriam, who 
long since must have died of old 
age. Home to anywhere: Rome, 
San Francisco, Kansas City, 
Hawaii, Brasilia — he had lived in 
all those places, all different, but 
all home. Corbett had been a born 
traveler, “at home” any- 
where - but he was not at home 
here and never would be. 

Now they would take here away 
from him. Even this world of four 
rooms and two roofs— this world 
of elbow-to elbow mutes and ut- 
ter slavery, this world of which he 
knew nothing — would have van- 
ished when he returned from the 
stars. 



RAMMER 



61 




Corbett rolled over and buried 
his face in his arms. If he didn’t 
sleep he would be groggy tomor- 
row. He might miss something es- 
sential. They had never tested his 
training. Read that. Not yet, 
not yet . 

He dozed. 

He came awake suddenly, al- 
ready up on one elbow, groping 
for some elusive thought. 

Ah. 

Why haven’t / been wondering 
about the biological package 
probes? 

A moment later he did won- 
der. 

What are the biological pack- 
age probes? 

But the wonder was that he had 
never wondered. 

He knew what and where they 
were: heavy fat cylinders ar- 
ranged around the waist of the star- 
ship’s hull. Ten of these, each 
weighing almost as much as Cor- 
bett’s own life-support system. He 
knew their mass distribution. He 
knew the clamp system that held 
them to the hull and could operate 
and repair the clamps under var- 
ious extremes of damage. He al- 
most knew where the probes went 
when released; it was just on the 
tip of his tongue — which meant he 
had had the RNA shot but had not 
yet seen the instructions. 

But he did not know what the 
probes were for. 

It was like that with the ship, he 
realized. He knew everything 



there was to know about a seeder 
ramship, but nothing at all about 
the other kinds of ramship or in- 
terplanetary travel or ground-to- 
orbit vehicles. He knew that he 
would be launched by linear ac- 
celerator from the moon. He knew 
the design of the accelera- 
tor — he could see it, three hundred 
and fifty kilometers of rings 
standing on end in a line across a 
level lunar mare. He knew what to 
do if anything went wrong during 
launch. And that was all he knew 
about the moon and lunar install- 
ations and lunar conquest, bar- 
ring what he had watched on tele- 
vision two hundred years ago. 

What was going on out there? In 
the two weeks since his arrival 
(awakening? resuscitation?) he 
had seen four rooms and two roof- 
tops, glimpsed a fantastic city- 
scape from a bridge and talked to 
one man who was not interested 
in telling him anything. What had 
happened in two hundren years? 

These men and women who slept 
around him. Who were they? Why 
were they her^ He didn’t even 
know if they were corpsicles or 
contemporary. Probably con- 
temporary. Not one of them was 
self-conscious about the facili- 
ties. 

Corbett had raised his buildings 
in all sorts of strange places, but he 
had never jumped blind. He had 
always brushed up on the lan- 
guage and studied the customs be- 
fore he went. Here he had no han- 



62 



GALAXY 




die, nowhere to start. He was lost. 

If only he had someone he could 
really talk to! 

He was learning in enormous 
gulps, taking in volumes of 
knowledge so broad that he hadn't 
realized how rigidly bounded they 
were. The State was teaching him 
only what he needed to know or 
might need to know some time. 
Every bit of information was 
aimed straight at his profession. 

Rammer. 

He could see the reasoning. He 
would be gone for several centur- 
ies. Why should the State teach 
him anything at all about today's 
technology, customs, geog- 
raphy? There would be trouble 
enough when he came back if he — 
Come to that, who had taught him 
to call the government the State? 
He knew nothing of its power and 
extent. How had he come to think 
of the State as all-powerful? 

It must be the RNA training. 
With data came attitudes below 
the conscious level, where he 
couldn’t get at them. 

W'hat were they doing to him? 

He had lost his world. He would 
lose this one. According to Pierce, 
he had lost himself four times al- 
ready. A condemned criminal had 
had his personality wiped four 
times. Now Corbett’s beliefs and 
motivations were being lost bit by 
bit to the RNA solution as the 
State made him over into a ram- 
mer. 

Was there nothing that was his? 



H E failed to see Pierce at exer- 
cise period. It was just as well. 
He was somewhat groggy. As usu- 
al, he ate dinner like a starving 
man. He returned to the dorm, 
rolled into his bunk and was in- 
stantly asleep. 

He looked up during study peri- 
od the next day and found Pierce 
watching him. He blinked, fight- 
ing free of a mass of data on the at- 
titude jet system that bled plas- 
ma from the inboard fusion plant 
that was also the emergency elec- 
trical power source— and asked, 
“Pierce, what's a biological pack- 
age probe?” 

“I would have thought they 
would teach you that. You know 
what to do with the probes, don’t 
you?" 

“The teaching widget gave me 
the procedure two days ago. Slow 
up for certain systems, kill the 
fields, turn a probe loose and speed 
up again.” 

“You don’t have to aim them?” 
“No, I guess they aim them- 
selves. But I have to get them down 
to a certain relative velocity to 
get them into the system.’’ 

“Amazing. They must do all the 
rest of it themselves.” Pierce 
shook his head. “I wouldn’t have 
believed it. Well, Corbett, the 
probes steer for a terrestrial 
world with a reducing atmo- 
sphere. They outnumber oxygen- 
nitrogen worlds about three to 
one in this arm of the galaxy and 
probably everywhere else, too — as 



RAMMER

you may know, if your age got 
that far.” 

“But what do the probes do?” 

“They’re biological packages. 
Bacteria. The idea is to turn a re- 
ducing atmosphere into an oxy- 
gen atmosphere, just the way cer- 
tain bacteria did it for Earth, 
something like fifteen-times-ten- 
to-the-eighth years ago.” The 
checker smiled — barely. His 

small narrow mouth wasn’t built 
to express any great emotion. 
“You’re part of a big project, Cor- 
bett.” 

“Good Lord. How long does it 
take?” 

“We think about fifty thousand 
years. Obviously we’ve never 
had a chance to measure it.” 

“But, good Lord! Do you really 
expect the State to last that long? 
Does even the State expect to last 
that long?” 

“That’s not your affair, Cor- 
bett. Still — ” Pierce consid- 
ered — “I don’t suppose 1 do. Or 
the State does. But humanity will 
last. One day there will be men on 
those worlds. It’s a Cause, Cor- 
bett. The immortality of the spe- 
cies. A thing bigger than one 
man’s life. And you’re part of it.” 

He looked at Corbett expect- 
antly. 

Corbett was deep in thought. He 
wa^ running a finger tip back and 
forth along the straight line of his 
nose. 

Presently he asked, “What’s it 
like out there?” 



“The stars? You’re — ” 

“No, no, no. The city. I catch 
just a glimpse of it twice a day: cu- 
bistic buildings with elaborate 
carvings at the street level — ” 

“What the bleep is this, Cor- 
bett? You don’t need to know any- 
thing about Selerdor. By the time 
you come home the whole city will 
be changed.” 

“I know, I know. That’s why I 
hate to leave without seeing 
something of this world. I could be 
going out to die — ” 

Corbett stopped. He had seen 
that considering look before, 
but he had never seen Pierce actu- 
ally angry. 

The checker’s voice was flat, his 
mouth pinched tight. “You think 
of yourself as some kind of tour- 
ist.” 

“So would you if you found 
yourself two hundred years in the 
future. If you didn’t have that 
much curiosity you wouldn’t be 
human.” 

“Granted that I’d want to look 
around. I certainly wouldn’t de- 
mand it as a right. Corbett, what 
were you thinking when you 
foisted yourself off on the future? 
Did you think the future owed you 
a debt? It’s the other way 
around — and time you realized 
it!” 

Corbett was silent. 

“I’ll tell you something. You’re 
a rammer because you’re a born 
tourist. We tested you for that. 
You like the unfamiliar — it 



64 



GALAXY 




doesn’t send you scuttling back to 
something safe and known. That’s 
rare.” The checker’s eyes said: 
And that’s why I've decided not to 
wipe your personality yet. His 
mouth said, “Was there anything 
else?” 

Corbett pushed his luck. “I’d 
like a chance to practice with a 
computer like the ship’s com- 
puter-autopilot.” 

“We don’t have one, but you’ll 
get your chance in two days. 
You’re leaving then.” 

IV 

N EXT day he received his in- 
structions for entering the so- 
lar system. He was to try anything 
and everything to make contact, 
up to and including flashing his 
attitude jets in binary code. The 
teaching widget was fanatical 
on the subject. 

He found that he would not be 
utterly dependent on rescue 
ships. He could slow the ramship 
by braking directly into the so- 
lar wind until the proton flux was 
too slow to help him. He could then 
proceed on attitude jets, using 
whatever hydrogen was left in 
the emergency tank. A nearly 
full tank would actually get him 
to the moon and land him there. 

The State was through with him 
when he dropped his last probe. It 
was good of the State to provide 
for his return, Corbett 
thought — and then he shook him- 



self. The State was not altruistic. 
It wanted the ship back. 

Now, more than ever, Corbett 
wanted a chance at the computer- 
autopilot. 

H E FOUND one more chance to 
talk to the checker. 

“A three-hundred-year round 
trip — maybe two hundred, ship’s 
time,” said Corbett. “I get some 
advantage from relativity. But, 
Pierce, you don’t really expect me 
to live two hundred years, do you? 
With nobody to talk to?” 

“The cold sleep treatment — ” 
“Even so.” 

Pierce frowned. “You haven’t 
studied medicine. I’m told that 
cold sleep has a rejuvenating effect 
over long periods. You’ll spend 
perhaps twenty years awake and 
the rest in cold sleep. The medical 
facilities are automatic; I’m sure 
you’ve been instructed how to use 
them. They are adequate. Do you 
think we’d risk your dying out 
there between the stars, where it 
would be impossible to replace 
you?” 

“No.” 

“Was there anything else you 
wanted to see me about?” 

“Yes.” He had decided not to 
raise the subject — now he changed 
his mind. “I’d like to take a wom- 
an with me. The life-support sys- 
tem would hold two of us easily 
enough. I worked it out. We’d need 
another cold sleep chamber, of 
course.” 



RAMMER 



65 




For two weeks this had been the 
only man Corbett could talk to. 
At first he had found Pierce un- 
fathomable, unreadable, almost 
inhuman. Since then he had 
learned to read the checker’s face 
to some extent. 

Now he watched Pierce decide 
whether to terminate Jerome 
Corbett and start over. 

It was a close thing. But the 
State had spent considerable 
time and effort on Jerome Cor- 
bett. It was worth a try . And so 
Pierce said, “That would take up 
some space. You would have to 
share the rest between you. 1 do 
not think you would survive, Cor- 
bett.” 

“But — ” 

“Look here, Corbett. We know 
you don’t need a woman. If you 
did you would have taken one by 
now and we would have wiped you 
and started over. You’ve lived in 
the dormitory for two weeks and 
you have not used the loving bunks 
once.” 

“Damn it. Pierce, do you expect 
me to make love in public? I 
can’t.” 

“Exactly.” 

“But—” 

“Corbett, you learned to use the 
toilet, didn’t you? Because you 
had to. You know what to do with 
a woman but you are one of those 
men fortunate enough not to need 
one. Otherwise you could not be a 
rammer.” 

If Corbett had hit the checker 



then he would have done it know- 
ing that it meant his death. And 
knowing that, he would have 
killed Pierce for forcing him to it. 

Something like ten seconds 
elapsed, during which he might 
have done it. Pierce watched him in 
frank curiosity. 

When he saw Corbett relax he 
said, “You leave tomorrow, Cor- 
bett. Your training is finished. 
Goodbye.” 

And Corbett walked out. 

THE dormitory had been a test. 
* He knew it now. Could he 
cross a narrow bridge with no 
handrails? Then he was not pa- 
thologically afraid of falling. 
Could he spend two hundred years 
alone in the cabin of a starship? 
Then the silent people around 
him, five above his head, thou- 
sands to either side, must make 
him markedly uncomfortable. 
Could he live two hundred years 
without a woman? Surely he 
must be impotent. 

He returned to the dorm after 
dinner. They had replaced the 
bridge with a slab of grass.. Cor- 
bett snarled and crossed ahead of 
the guard — the guard had to hurry 
to keep up. 

He stood between two walls of 
occupied bunks, looking about 
him. Then he did a stupid thing. 

He had already refrained from 
killing the checker. He must have 
decided to live. What he did, then, 
was stupid. He knew it. 



66 



GALAXY 




He looked about him until he 
found the slender darkhaired girl 
with the elfin face watching him 
curiously from near the ceiling. 
He climbed the rungs between 
bunks until his face was level with 
her bunk. 

He remembered that the ges- 
ture he needed was a quick, for- 
malized one; he didn’t know it. 

In English he asked, “Come with 
me?” 

She nodded brightly and fol- 
lowed him down the ladder. By 
then it seemed to Corbett that the 
dorm was alive with barely audi- 
ble voices. 

The odd one, the rammer 
trainee. 

Certainly a number of the wake- 
ful had turned to lie on their sides 
to watch. 

He felt their eyes on the back of 
his neck as he zipped open his gray 
jumpsuit and stepped out of it. 
The dormitory had been a series 
of tests. At least two of those eyes 
must belong to someone who 
would report to Pierce or to 
Pierce’s bosses. But to Corbett 
they were just like the others, all 
the eyes curiously watching to 
see how the speechless one would 
make out. 

And sure enough, he was impo- 
tent. It was the eyes-- and he was 
naked. The girl was first con- 
cerned, then pitying. She stroked 
his cheek in apology or sympathy 
and then she went away and found 
someone else. 



Corbett lay listening to them, 
gazing at the bunk above him. 

He waited for eight hours. Fi- 
nally a guard came to take him 
away. By then he didn’t care what 
they did with him. 

IJE DIDN’T start to care until 
^*the guard’s floating jeep pulled 
up beneath an enormous .22 long 
cartridge standing on end. Then he 
began to wonder. It was too small 
to be a rocket ship. 

But it was one. They strapped 
him into a contour couch, one of 
three in a cabin with one window. 
There were the guard type and 
Corbett and a man who might 
have been Pierce’s second cousin 
once removed. He had the win- 
dow. He also had the controls. 

Corbett’s heartbeat quick- 
ened. He wondered how it would 
be. 

It was as if he had suddenly be- 
come very heavy. He heard no 
noise except right at the begin- 
ning— a sound like landing gear 
being raised on an airplane. Not a 
rocket, Corbett thought — and he 
remembered the tricks a Bussard 
ramjet could play with magnetic 
fields. He was heavy and he hadn’t 
slept a wink last night. He went to 
sleep. 

When he awoke he was in free 
fall. Nobody had tried to tell him 
anything about free fall. The 
guard and the pilot watched him 
curiously to see what he would 
do. 



RAMMER 



67 




“Screw you,” said Corbett. 

It was another test. He got the 
straps open and pushed himself 
over to the window. The pilot 
laughed, caught him and held him 
while he closed a protective cov- 
er over the instruments. Then he 
let go and Corbett drifted before 
the window. 

His belly was revolving eccen- 
trically. His inner ear was going 
crazy. His testicles were tight up 
against his groin and that didn’t 
feel good either. He felt as if the 
elevator cable had snapped. Cor- 
bett snarled within his mind and 
tried to concentrate on the win- 
dow. But the Earth was not visi- 
ble. Neither was the moon. Just a 
lot of stars, bright enough — quite 
bright in fact even more brilliant 
than they had been above a small 
boat anchored off Catalina Is- 
land one night long ago. He 
watched them for some time. 

Trying to keep his mind off that 
falling elevator. 

He wasn’t about to get himself 
disqualified now. 

T HEY ate aboard in free fall. 

Corbett copied the others, 
picking chunks of meat and pota- 
toes out of a plastic bag of stew, 
pulling them through a membrane 
that sealed itself behind his pick. 

“Of all the things I’m going to 
miss,” he told the broad-faced 
guard, “I’m going to enjoy miss- 
ing you most. You and your god- 
dam staring eyes.” 



The guard smiled placidly and 
waited to see if Corbett would get 
sick. 

They landed a day after takeoff 
on a broad plain where the Earth 
sal nestled in a row of sharp lunar 
peaks. One day instead of 
four — the State had expended ex- 
tra power to get him here. But an 
Earth-moon flight must be a small 
thing these days. 

The plain was black with blast 
pits. It must have been a landing 
Held for decades. Enormous trans- 
parent bubbles with trees and 
buildings inside them clustered 
near the runway end of the linear 
accelerator, and spacecraft of 
various types were scattered about 
the plain. 

The biggest was Corbett’s ram- 
ship: a silver skyscraper lying 
on its side. The probes were in 
place, giving the ship a thick- 
waisted appearance. To Cor- 
bett’s trained eye it looked ready 
for takeoff. 

Corbett donned his suit first, 
while the pilot and guard watched 
to see if he would make a mistake. 
It was the first time he had seen 
such a suit off the teaching screen. 
He took it slowly. 

There was an electric cart. Ap- 
parently Corbett was not ex- 
pected to know how to walk on an 
airless world. He thought to head 
for one of the domes, but the guard 
steered straight for the ramship. It 
was a long way off. 

It had become unnervingly 



68 



GALAXY 




large when the guard stopped un- 
derneath. 

The guard said, “Now you in- 
spect your ship.” 

“You can talk?” 

“Yes. Yesterday, a quickie 
course.” 

“Oh.” 

“Three things wrong with your 
ship. You find all three. You tell 
me, 1 tell him.” 

“Him? Oh, the pilot. Then 
what?” 

“Then you fix one of the things, 
we fix the others. Then we launch 
you.” 

I T WAS another test, of course. 

Maybe the last. Corbett was 
furious. He started immediately 
with the field generators and 
gradually he forgot the guard and 
the pilot and the sword still hang- 
ing over his head. He knew this 
ship. As it had been with the teach- 
ing chair, so it was with the ship it- 
self. Corbett’s impotence changed 
to omnipotence. The power of the 
beast, the intricacy, the potential, 
the — the hydrogen tank held far 
too much pressure. That wouldn’t 
wait. 

“I’ll slurry this now,” he told the 
guard. “Get a tanker over here to 
top it off.” He bled gas slowly 
through the gauge, lowering the 
fuel’s vapor pressure without let- 
ting fuel boil out the gauge itself. 
When he finished the liquid hy- 
drogen would be slushy with fro- 



zen crystals under near-vacuum 
pressure. 

He finished the external inspec- 
tion without finding anything 
more. It figured; the banks of dials 
held vastly more information than 
a man’s eyes could read through 
opaque titanalloy skin. 

The airlock was a triple-door 
type, not so much to save air as to 
give him an airlock even if he lost a 
door somehow. Corbett shut the 
outer door, used the others as 
green lights indicated he could. 
He looked down at the telltales 
under his chin as he started to un- 
clamp his helmet. 

Vacuum? 

He stopped. The ship’s gauges 
said air. The suit’s said vacuum. 
Which was right? Come to think of 
it, he hadn’t heard any hissing. 
Just how soundproof was his hel- 
met? 

Just like Pierce to wait and see if 
he would take off his helmet in 
vacuum. Well, how to test? 

Hah! Corbett found the head, 
turned on a water spigot. The wa- 
ter splashed oddly in lunar gravi- 
ty. It did not boil. 

Corbett doffed his helmet and 
continued his inspection. 

There was no way to test the 
electromagnetic motors with- 
out causing all kinds of havoc in 
the linear accelerator. He checked 
out the telltales as best he could, 
then concentrated on the life-sup- 
port mechanisms. The tailored 
plants in the air system were alive

and well. But the urea absorption 
mechanism was plugged somehow. 
That would be a dirty job. He 
postponed it. 

Did a flaw in his suit constitute 
a flaw in the ship? 

He decided to finish the in- 
spection. The State might have 
missed something. It was his ship, 
his life. 

The cold sleep chamber was like 
a great coffin, a corpsicle coffin. 
Corbett shuddered at the sight of 
it*~— it reminded him of two hun- 
dred years spent waiting in liquid 
nitrogen. He wondered again if 
Jerome Corbett were really dead 
— and then he shook off the won- 
der and went to work. 

No flaw there. 

The computer was acting vague- 
ly funny. 

He had a hell of a time tracing 
the problem. There was a minute 
break in one superconducting 
circuit, so small that some cur- 
rent was leaking through anyway, 
by inductance. Bastards. He 
donned his suit and went out to re- 
port. 

The guard heard him out, con- 
sulted with the other man, then 
told Corbett, “You did good. Now 
finish with the topping off pro- 
cedure. We fix the other things.” 

“There’s something wrong with 
my suit too.” 

“New suit aboard now.” 

“I want some time with the com- 
puter,” said Corbett. “I want to 
be sure it’s all right now.” 



“W'e fix it good. When you top 
off fuel you leave.” 

That suddenly, Corbett felt a 
vast sinking sensation. The whole 
moon was dropping away under 
him. 

They launched him hard. Cor- 
bett saw red before his eyes, felt 
his cheeks dragged far back to- 
ward his ears. The ship would be all 
right — it was built to stand elec- 
tromagnetic eddy currents from 
any direction. 

He survived. He fumbled out of 
his couch in time to watch the 
moonscape flying under him, re- 
ceding, a magnificent view. 

There were days of free fall. He 
was not yet moving at ram speeds. 
But the State had aimed him in- 
side the orbit of Mercury, 
straight into the thickening sol- 
ar wind. Protons. Thick fuel for 
the ram fields and a boost from the 
sun’s gravity. 

Meanwhile he had several days. 
He went to work with the comput- 
er. 

At one point it occurred to him 
that the State might monitor his 
computer work. He shrugged it 
off. Probably it was too late for 
the State to stop him now. In any 
case, he had said too much al- 
ready. 

He finished his work at the 
computer and got answers that 
satisfied him. At higher speeds 
the ram fields were self-reinforc- 
ing — they would support them- 
selves and the ship. He could find 



70 



GALAXY 




no upper limit to the velocity of a 
ramship. 

With all the time in the world, 
then, he sat down at the control 
console and began to play with 
the ram fields. 

They emerged like invisible 
wings and he felt the buffeting of 
badly controlled bursts of fusing 
hydrogen. He kept the fields close 
to the ship, fearful of losing the 
balance here, where the stream- 
ing of protons was so uneven. He 
could feel how he was doing — he 
could fly this ship by the seat of his 
pants with RNA training to help 
him. 

He felt like a giant. This enor- 
mous, phallic, germinal flying 
thing of metal and fire! Carrying 
the seeds of life for worlds that 
had never known life, he roared 
around the sun and out. The thrust 
dropped a bit then, because he and 
the solar wind were moving in the 
same direction. But he was catch- 
ing it in his nets like wind in a sail, 
guiding it and burning it and 
throwing it behind him. The ship 
moved faster every second. 

This feeling of power, enor- 
mous masculine power - it had 
to be partly RNA training. At 
this point he didn’t care. Part was 
him, Jerome Corbett. 

Around the orbit of Mars, when 
he was sure that a glimpse of sun- 
light would not blind him, he 
opened all the ports. The sky 
blazed around him. There were no 
planets nearby and all he saw of 



the sky was myriads of brilliant 
pinpoints, mostly white, some 
showing traces of color. But there 
was more to see. Fusing hydro- 
gen made a ghostly ring of light 
around his ship. 

It would grow stronger. So far 
his thrust was low, somewhat 
more than enough to balance the 
thin pull of the sun. 

He started his turn around the 
orbit of Jupiter by adjusting the 
fields to channel the proton flow 
to the side. That helped this thrust, 
but it must have puzzled Pierce 
and the faceless State. They would 
assume he was playing with the 
fields, testing his equipment. 
Maybe. His curve was gradu- 
al — it would take them a while to 
notice. 

This was not according to plan. 
Originally he had intended to go 
as far as Van Maanan's Star, then 
change course. That would have 
given him 2x15 = 30 years’ head 
start, in case he was wrong, in case 
the State could do something to 
stop him even now. Fifteen years 
for the light to show them his 
change in course; fifteen more be- 
fore retaliation could reach him. 

It was wise; but he couldn’t do it. 
Pierce might die in thirty years. 
Pierce might never know he had 
failed - and that thought was in- 
tolerable. 

His thrust dropped to almost 
nothing in the outer reaches of 
the system. Protons were thin out 
here. But there were enough to

push his velocity steadily higher 
and that was what counted. The 
faster he went, the greater the 
proton flux. He was on his way. 



H E WAS beyond Neptune when 
the voice of Pierce the checker 
came to him, saying, “This is 
Peerssa for the State, Peerssa for 
the State. Answer, Corbett. Do 
you have a malfunction? Can we 
help? We cannot send rescue but 
we can advise. Peerssa for the 
State, Peerssa for the State — ” 
Corbett smiled tightly. Peers- 
sa? The checker’s name had 
changed pronunciation in two 
hundred years. Pierce had slipped 
back to an old habit, RNA les- 
sons forgotten. He must be up- 
set. 

Corbett spent twenty minutes 
finding the moon base with his sig- 
nal laser. The beam was too nar- 
row to permit sloppy handling. 

When he had it adjusted he said, 
“This is Corbett for himself, Cor- 
bett for himself. I’m fine. How are 
you?” 

He spent more time at the com- 



puter. One thing had been bother- 
ing him: the return. He planned to 
be away longer than the State 
would have expected. Suppose 
there was nobody on the moon 
when he returned? 

It would be a problem, he 
found. If he could reach the moon 
on his remaining fuel (no emer- 
gencies, remember), he could 
reach the Earth’s atmoshere. The 
ship was durable; it would stand a 
meteoric re-entry. But his atti- 
tude jets would not land him, prop- 
erly speaking. 

Unless he could cut away part of 
the ship. The ram field generators 
would no longer be needed . 
Well, he would work it out some- 
how. Plenty of time. Plenty of 
time. 

The answer took nine hours. 
“Peerssa for the State. Corbett, 
we don’t understand. You are 
way off course. Your first target 
was to be Van Maanan’s Star. In- 
stead you seem to be curving 
around toward Sagittarius. 
There is no known Earthlike plan- 
et in that direction. What the 
bleep do you think you're doing?

Corbett tried to switch it off. The 
teaching chair hadn’t told him 
about an off switch. He managed 
to disconnect a wire. Somewhat 
later, he located the lunar base 
with his signal laser and began 
transmission. 

“This is Corbett for himself, 
Corbett for himself. I'm getting 
sick and tired of having to find you 
every damn time I want to say 
something. So I'll give you this all 
at once. 

“I’m not going to any of the 
stars on your list. 

“It’s occurred to me that the 
relativity equations work better 
for me the faster I go. If I stop ev- 
ery fifteen light-years to launch a 
probe, the way you want me to, I 
could spend two hundred years at 
it and never get anywhere. Where- 
as if I just aim the ship in one di- 
rection and keep going, I can build 
up a ferocious Tau factor. 

“It works out that I can reach 
the galactic hub in twenty-one 
years, ship’s time, if I hold myself 
down to one gravity accelera- 



tion. And, Pierce, I just can’t re- 
sist the idea. You were the one who

hub aren’t like the stars in the 
arms. And they’re packed a quart- 
er to a half light-year apart, ac- 
cording to your own theories. It 
must be passing strange in there. I 
can’t resist it. 

“So I’ll go exploring on my 
own. Maybe I’ll find some of your 
reducing atmosphere planets 
and drop the probes there. Maybe 
I won’t. I'll see you in about sev- 
enty thousand years, your time. 
By then your precious State may 
have withered away. Or you’ll 
have colonies on the seeded plan-

broken loose from you. I’ll join 
one of them. Or ”

I get back, there are always the 
Clouds of Magellan. I’ll bet they 
aren’t more than twenty-five years 
away, ship’s time." ★

T HE on-duty police force of 
Chicago Conurb SSE (Indiana) 
was at his console. Ghost streets 
flickered on the monitors from 
the mobile units, rinsing him in 
light, but he was alone, seeing, un- 
seen. There was no sound except a 
muted, air-conditioned sigh. 

Before Braun were twelve small 
screens, a large screen, a pair of 
waldo inputs and a GO-NO GO 
override. 

“Query,” said the computer. 
“Unit Five.” The Unit 5 pickup 
expanded on the large screen. 
“Group over three, classifiable 
as unlawful assembly under lo- 
cal ordinance. Decision?” 

“Move pickup in,” said Braun 
and three middle-aged men came 
on the screen, squinting impas- 
sively into the spot over the pick- 
up lens. 

“Two Caucasoid, one Ne- 
groid,” said the computer. “De- 
cision?” 

They looked all right and wore 
business suits. “Standard state- 
ment of apology. Continue Unit 
Five on program.” The three men 
vanished and Braun looked back 
up to the row of monitors. Still 
three hours and twenty-eight min- 
utes of his four-hour shift to go. 

It was hard to remember what a 
mobile unit looked like to civil- 
ians — the shifting lights and curves 
of the dark-blue carapace, the 
sensor-manipulator head on its 
extensible neck, the flattened 
weapons turret. People called 



them “blue beetles” or sometimes 
“bluebottles” and wrote letters 
to the editor about bringing back 
the cop on the beat. 

Braun had scarcely seen the ex- 
terior of the mobile unit since 
training. Except in moments of 
leisure or disorientation, no man 
really looks at his own hand and 
most of the time he saw a mobile 
unit only when one showed up on 
another’s pickup. 

The relationship between man, 
computer and mobile unit could 
be confusing — the officer who had 
had to be hospitalized because he 
thought he had projected his soul 
into a mobile unit was still de- 
partmental legend. Braun had nev- 
er felt any such danger, probably 
because the computer’s voice was 
not his own. He knew that he was 
shut inside the computer like a 
conscience in the brain and that 
the mobile units were far away, 
moving according to the comput- 
er’s commands — except in situa- 
tions out of the ordinary, when he 
would earn his pay. 

“Query. Anomaly. Unit 
Twelve.” A young woman in the 
last months of pregnancy appeared 
on the large screen. She was blond 
and drained of color in the glare. 
“Woman alone on the streets.” 
“Switch me in.” 

“Affirmative.” 

“Ma’m?” 

She stared at the voice. “Yes?” 
“Anything wrong?” 

“No,” she said. Her voice was

small and cool. “I just had to get 
some cigarettes.” 

“May I have your citizen num- 
ber and address?” 

“My name — ” she pronounced 
the words with care — “is Mary 
Cecile O’Hara; my citizen num- 
ber is — ” she gave it and also her 
address. Before she had finished, 
a display in red flashed in the cor- 
ner of the screen: there was a map 
pinpointing her as only two hun- 
dred feet from Block 31 Hoosier 
Towers, the address she had 
given, and below; CITIZEN 
NUMBER CONFIRMED, AD- 
DRESS UNCONFIRMED. 
“Have you moved recently?” 
“Oh, yes. We just moved in yes- 
terday.” 

“Would you like a mobile unit 
to escort you back to your door?” 
“That would be nice,” said Mary 
Cecile O’Hara. 

EMERGENCY— EMERGEN- 
CY EMERGENCY. 

“I must sign off,” said Braun. 
“The mobile unit will put me in 
contact if necessary — ” and an- 
other pickup was on the screen. 

“Unit Eight. Under sniper fire. 
Armor-piercing. No damage.” 
“Source?” 

“Roof Longhouse Forty-five- 
Red, J.T. McCutcheon Develop- 
ment. IR scanner localization con- 
firmed by ballistic analysis.” 
INCOMING, flashed the 
screen. “Incoming. No damage,” 
said the voice. “Same localization. 
Reply?” 



“Affirmative.” 

“Stoner or grenade?” 

“Grenade.” 

“Hypnotic or concussion?” 
“Hypnotic. Bracket of three. 
Call in Hovering Squad. Alert 
fixed scanners.” 

“Launched. Third shot incom- 
ing. No damage.” 

B RAUN could imagine. But 
could the snipers? Borosilicates 
and pure iron filaments, elec- 
tronic reflexes, sensors that from 
a hundred yards away could take 
the temperature of a moth or tell 
if a lock’s tumblers moved — these 
were still beyond ordinary expecta- 
tion. All spinoff from the defunct 
space program and Southeast 
Asia. Braun remembered a man 
who had tried to claw open the 
maintenance bay of a unit bare- 
handed. 

“Estimate?” 

“No further fire. Situation 
under control. Hovering Squad 
dispatched and homing.” 

“Return Unit Eight to pro- 
gram at discretion.” In the month 
after the introduction of police 
hypnotics, friends or accom- 
plices had attempted to rescue 
unconscious suspects. But then 
the knowledge that the sleep of the 
gassed could slide into fatal co- 
ma without the antidote became 
widespread. Now the victims 
were left to the comparative 
mercy of the police interns hover- 
ing above the roof-tops.

“Query. Unit Three. Youth 
stopped. Over eighteen and not 
subject to curfew, but under 
twenty-one. Marijuana stop and 
frisk?” 

“Affirmative. Standard apolo- 
gy if indicated.” 

The night ground on. In a free 
moment Braun punched for a tube 
of coffee, though he knew he’d pay 
for it in sleep later, and glanced 



around the cubicle. It was sur- 
prising how impersonal it still 
was. The only thing of his was the 
brass paperweight holding down 
the printouts, with the inscrip- 
tion from President Truman: 
THE BUCK STOPS HERE but 
one of the day men had taped up a

Stephen Tall is not really Stephen Tall at all. 
He is, in fact, Professor of Biology at an East 
Coast college, and he keeps his real identity a 
closely guarded secret. Occasionally our 
professor brings science fiction into Ihe 
classroom as illustrative reading material. 
And his students have not as yet guessed that 
their teacher is also a highly regarded yarn 
spinner in s-f circles. 

Tall tales have been appearing in the mag* 
azines since 1955 when GALAXY published 
“The Lights on Precipice Peak” — later 
adapted for the radio program X-1 — a series 
whose scripts came from the pages of 
GALAXY. Serving on several college coun- 
cils, in addition to fulfilling his regular teach- 
ing assignments, has not left Tall with much 
time to write over the last twenty years. But 
now that he has an agent who is always 
badgering him to keep up with the growing 
s-f market, his fiction output has been in- 
creasing. At present Tall is at work on his 
first novel. He reports that it will be one of 
his Stardust series — the series to which his 
story in this issue belongs. Incidentally, Dr. 
Kissinger and his navigator Moe Cheng have 
been cruising the galaxies together for years. 
Was this, perhaps, prognostication? 



Tall denies it. He writes us that he “couldn’t 
run the Stardust without Roscoe Kissinger. 
He’s my narrator in four stories and in the 
novel now two-thirds written. Dr. Henry K. is 
a Johnny-come-lately, and no relation to 
Roscoe at all. Just as Chou En-Lai has noth- 
ing in common with Moe Cheng except a 
thick upper eyelid. Without Cheng to navi- 
gate, Cap'n Jules Griffin could not implement 
Ullraspan. I hope nobody named Rasmussen 
becomes conspicuous in world doings. Then 
we might indeed have to close up shop.” 

Tail’s specialties include field sciences and 
ecology — and he is known both as an ornithol- 
ogist and an entomologist. He has recently 
returned from a research jaunt to the Rock- 
ies where he studied the ecosystems above 
timberiine. 

“Now that ‘ecology’ has become a word 
everybody knows, readers are beginning to 
look for it in their science fiction,” says Tall. 
And we look forward to more s-f from our 
ecology-minded professor. We also look for- 
ward to more ecology from our s-f-minded 
professor. In and out of his stories. What the 
world needs now, say we, is not only love — 
but ecological research and awareness. And 
the troops are led by such as Stephen Tall.

vations on the Supreme Court; 
and Smith had actually hung his 
degree from MIT and his IBM 
certificate on the bulkhead as if 
they made him different. 

And there was no mirror. When 
Smith had put one up they made 
him take it down- the designers 
said mirrors were “distracting.” 
“Query. Unit Six. Verse prop- 
aganda found in Roger D. Bran- 
igin Mall.” 

“Subject?” 

“Law and law enforcement.” 
“Pickup.” 

A flickering sheet appeared, 
too dim to read. “Focus.” The 
suction fingers on the pickup 
head spread it flat, the xerographed 
letters jumped out at him. 

Superimposed upon a crude 
cartoon of a turn-of-the-century 
policeman was a poem curling 
down the page like a river or a 
snake or the hairless tail of some 
rodent: 

Fury said to 

a mouse. That 

he met in the house, 

it began and he read down its twist- 
ing, diminishing length to the 
end. 

“Quite clever and indirect,” 
he said. “What’s the author’s 
name? I can’t quite see it.” 

“Lewis Carroll.” 

“Any listing?” 

“No listing.” 

“Not even a pedestrian ticket?” 



“No listing.” 

“Credit transactions, tax 
records, social security?” 

“No listing.” 

“Query on-line data banks na- 
tionally.” 

“Record: Lewis Carroll a pseu- 
donym.” 

“Author’s real name?” 

“Charles L. Dodgson.” 

“Occupation?” 

“Mathematician.” 

“Where employed?” 

“No data.” 

“Doesn’t he eat?” 

“No. Charles L. Dodgson died 
eighteen-ninety-eight.” 

Even though no one was watch- 
ing, not even the machine, Braun’s 
face burned as if the skin had been 
peeled away. He read down to the 
end again:

T HERE is no lovelier planet any- 
where than Terra Nova and no 
pageant more splendid than the 
Festival at Perigord. The proces- 
sion will be fine this year —I think I 
should like to see it. 

There will be banners and bu- 
gles, the proud young men in jack- 
ets of scarlet and gold and purple, 



79 



girls dancing in diaphanous robes 
with flowers in their hair. And 
trailing along behind will come 
the pilgrims, a drab lot as a rule, 
draggled about the hems, but very 
solemn and earnest. 

They will wind through the 
streets of the town with a joyful 
noise of bells and drums and tam- 
bourines to the top of the windy hill 
that overlooks the harbor — and 
they will come down at last to 
Thomas Howard Square, where 
the many-faceted spire of the 
Thomas Howard Monument 
catches the sunlight and shatters 
it into countless glittering frag- 
ments. 

There will be speeches then, and 
paeans and hosannas. And the 
faces of the celebrants will— for a 
while — be sober, as they worship 
at the shrine of the Martyr Saint of 
Perigord. 

The incense at the altar will min- 
gle with the heavy fragrance of 
flowering trees and with the faint 
sea-haze blown up from the harbor. 
The air of Terra Nova goes to the 
head like strong wine — though 
there will be plenty of that too for 
those who need it. 

Through the long afternoon 
there will be singing and dancing 
and the music of tabor and trumpet 
and psaltery will float on the warm 
air. At night, in the great mirrored 
hall of the Temple of the True Fol- 
lowers, the lamps will burn until 
dawn. 

1 have heard that people come to 



Perigord from three galaxies in 
search of sensual delight and 
spiritual exaltation. My memories 
of earlier years give me reason to 
doubt it. And the Festival this year 
will outshine all previous ones, for 
this is the fiftieth anniversary of 
the day Thomas Howard, founder 
of the Faith, Father of all True 
Followers, went forth and sacri- 
ficed himself to save the human 
race. 

I’m an old woman now and it’s 
nearly fifty years since 1 left Peri- 
gord. I don’t suppose I’ll ever go 
back — least of all on Festival Day. 
I think that I might climb up on the 
platform with the speakers, wave 
my arms for silence and scream in- 
to the faces of the crowd, Lies, lies! 
All this is lies ! 

And the faces would gaze at me 
with malice or pity and incompre- 
hension and I would be shut away, 
without comment, in a home for 
the demented old. 

But I should like, all the same, to 
exorcise this demon that has lived 
with me for half a century and so I 
am going to add to the record my 
story of Thomas Howard — not 
Howard the Martyr Saint; there 
are already too many books on 
that subject — but of a man named 
Thomas Howard whom I knew a 
long time ago. 

1 WAS nineteen years old, a stu- 
dent and still in that state of 
pleasant insanity that sees the 
whole universe as a ripe plum. It 



80 



GALAXY 




was a wonderful age in which to be 
young. Star drive was less than half 
a century old. Earth was still 
drunk with dreams of empire. For 
me and for the human race all 
things were possible. 

1 remember that I was taking 
Comparative Extra-Terrestrial 
Religion or Martian Epic Poetry 
or some other such frivolous 
liberal arts course. Thomas 
Howard was in my class. He sal in 
the seat next to mine — otherwise I 
might never have noticed him. 

He was not in the least good- 
looking. He had a large square 
head surmounted by a bristly crop 
of sand-colored hair. His skin was 
doughy and pale, as though he ate 
badly and never went outdoors. 
But he turned once and stared at 
me and I saw his eyes. They were 
deep-set, a cold silver-gray, the 
color of a starship’s hull and 
ringed with shadow. Unac- 
countably, they frightened me. 

He was older by five or six years 
than the usual sophomore. I 
gathered that he was something of 
a professional student. I saw him 
often at refreshments between 
classes and once or twice he bought 
me something. He seemed in- 
terested in me in an odd sort of 
way, but he made me uncomfort- 
able. Under the gaze of those 
strange pale eyes 1 felt far too 
much like a laboratory specimen 
impaled on a pin. There was no 
warmth in his face, only a sort of 
mocking amusement, a cynical 



appreciation of human absurdity. 
What went on in the mind behind 
that facade was impossible to 
guess. 

I thought of him as solitary, 
remote, detached from ordinary 
human relationships — which I 
suppose is why it was a shock for 
me to meet Jocelyn. She was sit- 
ting with him one day in the 
servomat — a big voluptuous, rath- 
er stupid-looking blond girl. I had 
come in with a classmate named 
Bill Ferguson, and Thomas How- 
ard beckoned us over. He mo- 
tioned vaguely across the table 
with his spoon. 

“Jocelyn,” he said. If she had a 
last name he didn’t bother to men- 
tion it. 

“We’ve met,” Bill said. 

I glanced at her with curiosity. 
She had beautiful nordic features 
and large eyes that gazed on How- 
ard with devotion. I don’t remem- 
ber her saying anything and after 
this cursory introduction Howard 
ignored her. 

When they left I said to Bill, 
“Who’s Jocelyn?” 

Bill looked embarrassed. “When 
I knew her in her pre-Howard 
days she was nice — a well-brought- 
up small-town girl. She used to be- 
long to the Ecumenical Fellow- 
ship, sing in the choir — the whole 
bit. But our friend Howard seems 
to have taken her over body and 
soul.” 

I raised my eyebrows. 

“If you’re going to ask is she 



STARCULT

living with him — the answer is 
yes.” He grunted. “Whatever that 
guy has, he should bottle it.” 

What Howard had was not, 1 
discovered, lightly to be dismissed. 

I belonged to a lot of campus 
clubs in those days and one of my 
favorite spots for idling away a 
lunch hour was the Galactic Af- 
fairs Society clubroom. GAS was 
one of those quasi-political 
campus discussion groups with a 
membership that covered the 
ideological spectrum- every- 
thing from fuzzy neo-socialists to 
Galactic Federalists to colonial 
types weighed down by the Earth- 
man’s Burden. 1 think most of us 
were there because the seats were 
upholstered and there was a re- 
freshment bar next door. 

I wandered in one day and spot- 
ted Thomas Howard sitting alone 
at the back of the room, aloof as al- 
ways and faintly amused. He had 
never mentioned his politics to me. 
1 wondered where he would fit in. 

The meeting rapidly bogged 
down in one of our interminably 
pointless arguments — this time 1 
think it was a question of buying 
or not buying green baize to re- 
cover the conference table. A 
sense of futility settled like a 
miasma over the room. The chair- 
man had begun to stare fixedly at 
the clock. It occurred to me, sleep- 
ily, that most of our meetings were 
like this. 

Then Thomas Howard rose to 
his feet. 



“Fools,” he said and the word 
brought me with a jolt out of a 
halfdoze. Everyone in the room 
turned around to stare at him. 

“I have listened long enough,” 
he said, “to this puerile squab- 
bling. Earth is rotten with corrup- 
tion and the disease is spread- 
ing — we are contaminating the 
stars. And you — the new gen- 
eration. While humanity cries out 
for a strong fresh wind to blow 
away the accumulated filth of 
ages, to sweep the galaxy 
clean — what do you do?” The 
words fairly dripped with ridi- 
cule and contempt. “You sit in 
this stuffy little room and wrangle 
over what? The color of a table- 
cloth!” 

At first I thought. This is a joke, 
an elaborate put-on . But How- 
ard was scarcely the type for un- 
dergraduate humor, which left 
only one other possible conjec- 
ture- -the man was a lunatic. 

At any rate, he had our full at- 
tention. The chairman had gone 
quite rigid with astonishment or in- 
dignation or both. 

Thomas Howard warmed to his 
subject. He had a remarkable 
voice, rich, deep-timbered, pow- 
erful — an actor’s voice or an ora- 
tor’s. It was — or so I thought at the 
time^his greatest asset. He had 
learned to use it as one plays a fine 
instrument. One moment it was 
comanding, the next insinuating. 
Now it was gentle and soothing, 
now a thunderous roar.

“You call yourselves the Galac- 
tic Affairs Society. Isn’t it time 
you looked at the real questions 
that face the human race? Some of 
you are expansionists, some fed- 
eralists. But the true choice, the 
one you have chosen to ignore, is 
not whether to stretch out our 
greedy hands to foul more systems 
or whether to sit here and enjoy 
our prosperity like so many hogs 
before a full trough. No. We must 
decide— and decide quickly — be- 
tween decadence and spiritual 
purity, between the stench of 
moral decay and the clean wind of 
ascetism. We must cleanse and 
purify our society of greed and 
gluttony and corruption. Then, 
and only then, will we be fit to ex- 
pand to other systems and be wel- 
come wherever we go.” 

The voice and the eyes — those 
icy, compelling gray eyes— some- 
how broke down the barriers of 
the mind, shattering skepticism, 
persuading, dominating, de- 
manding. I can’t explain it. I have 
never been able to explain it even 
to myself — and least of all to those 
who have never heard Thomas 
Howard speak. But he talked to a 
roomful of people who a few min- 
utes earlier had been bored, rest- 
less and irritated. And what we 
heard was not the preposterous, 
melodramatic speech but the sav- 
age intensity of conviction that 
burned behind it. 

Out of that meeting was born the 
Universal Purification Party. 



The Galactic Affairs Society be- 
came the vanguard of a campus 
movement that six months later 
controlled the Student Council. 

As for myself, I switched my al- 
legiance to the Campus Catch 
and Madrigal Society. Even then, 
with all my illusions still intact, I 
had little taste for reforming hu- 
manity and a growing suspicion 
of Thomas Howard. 



I SAW him infrequently after 
that, more often on tri-di post- 
ers than in the flesh. There was a 
vacancy on council. He won the 
seat and the Purification Party em- 
barked on an aggressive — and well- 
financed — campaign to sweep the 
end-of-term elections. I noticed 
that Howard was cutting classes 
more often than not. 

I ran across him one evening, 
though, sitting alone with Jocelyn 
in the deserted library. Both of 
them were dressed in the long gray 
robes of the Purification Party. On 
smaller girls it was a dowdy, 
shapeless garment but it suited 
Jocelyn. It gave her the majestic 
look of one of the heroines of 
Earth’s idealized past. 

That unexpected meeting gave 
me an ideal chance to ask a ques- 
tion that had been bothering me 
for months. I went over and sat 
down. My question was not the 
sort that lent itself to tact and di- 
plomacy — I decided on a frontal 
attack.

“Thomas,” I said. “What are 
you up to?” 

He had a trick of raising one eye- 
brow in sardonic enquiry. “Up to? 
My dear Anna!” 

“Tell it to me simply. What’s the 
point of all this purification busi- 
ness?” 

“You haven’t been reading my 
pamphlets. Or listening to my 
speeches.” 

“Rot. You’re not interested in 
cleansing and purifying society. 
You’re careful not to talk about 
your private life, but I have friends 
who tell me things.” I noticed that 
Jocelyn was looking uncom- 
fortable. I steeled myself. This was 
no time for delicacy. 

“All right,” he said. “I’ll tell you 
the truth — but you won’t like it. I 
want power. A great deal of pow- 
er. And 1 have the means of get- 
ting it. This campus is just the be- 
ginning, a testing ground. You 
might call it a lab experiment.” 

“You’re going to take over the 
galaxy?” I suppose I must have 
sounded amused. 

“Not just the galaxy, Anna. 
Some day the name of Thomas 
Howard will be known beyond 
it — wherever men’s minds reach. 
Minds are what I want, An- 
na — yours, everyone’s.” 

His eyes probed mine, reached 
past them and suddenly I was 
furious. I had not invited the in- 
trusion. 

“That’s the most ridiculous 
thing I’ve ever heard. Here you are, 



a perpetual student in a third-rate 
university and you’re going to 
take over the galaxy. You haven’t 
even got a degree. In fact you 
barely passed your mid-terms.” I 
glared at him. “You must think 
you’re awfully good at some- 
thing!” 

He spoke quietly. “I am good at 
something, Anna. I understand 
people. And I can make them do 
what I want.” 

“You think so because you’ve 
manipulated a lot of political 
malcontents?” 

“Jocelyn. Tell Anna what we live 
on, you and I.” 

Jocelyn’s eyes widened and her 
jaw dropped. She looked as 
though she had been kicked unex- 
pectedly in the midriff. 
“Thomas?” 

“Tell Anna where we get our 
money.” 

She stared at him. 

Finally she whispered, “I — I 
work.” 

Her face had turned beet red. 

“What do you work at, Joce- 
lyn?” His voice was gentle and in- 
sistent. 

She turned her head away. “I go 
with men. For money.” 

Thomas Howard smiled. He was 
satisfied. “You see, Anna, I can 
make anyone do anything.” His 
cold gray eyes stared into mine. 
“Even you, Anna.” 

I rose without speaking and 
walked out of the library. I hoped 
that I would never meet Thomas

Howard again for as long as I 
lived. 

II 

I LEFT campus at the end of that 
term and went on to technical 
school. A year or so later I began 
to see Howard’s name in the news- 
papers. He had moved on to larger 
campuses and his ripples were 
widening rapidly. Then I headed 
for the outworlds with my brand- 
new communications papers — and 
when next 1 returned to Earth, 
Thomas Howard had dropped out 
of sight. 

Which brings me to the day that 
1 discovered Perigord. The name 
gave me a mild shock as I read 
through the Job Opportunities — 
Outplanets column. Coming 
across it in that dreary succes- 
sion of Jones Landings and West 
Newtons and New Londons was 
like finding a jewel in a bucket of 
nuts and bolts. I read the ad. Peri- 
gord was the only town on Terra 
Nova, an Earthlike, English- 
speaking planet well out on the 
rim of the galaxy. Logic told me 
that I would find yet another grub- 
by, dusty little mining town, but to 
my irrational feminine imagina- 
tion the name conjured up visions 
of roses and troubadours and sun- 
lit history-book castles. And so 1 
came to Perigord — in search of 
what? I suppose it must have been 
romance. 

Some nostalgic French ex- 



patriate must have gazed upon 
that vivid green and blue and ochre 
landscape and the great plateaus 
and towers of rock rising up be- 
hind the town and given Perigord 
its name. 

The impression you have, as you 
approach the town from a dis- 
tance, is that some careless hand 
has scattered heaps and mounds of 
rainbow-colored jewels in the 
middle of a high meadow. The 
mountains lie behind and the sea 
below — and as you come closer 
you can see the little boats with 
brightly colored sails far out in 
the harbor mouth. 

When you go through the streets 
of Perigord on a clear day you walk 
with your eyes squinted against the 
dazzle. The walls of the houses 
are green and amber and blue and 
scarlet in every shade imaginable 
and they flash and glitter like 
gems in the sunshine. 

Most structures on the planet 
are built from a native mineral 
quarried in the hills; on Earth we 
called it star-crystal. Immensely 
durable, it splits conveniently 
into blocks and can be polished to 
a diamond-like brilliance. Those 
strange and beautiful rock for- 
mations behind Perigord, the 
many-colored spires and pin- 
nacles and high flat mesas, are 
star-crystal deposits; they have 
endured through the centuries 
while the elements wore down the 
softer rock around them. 

You still see a few private 



STARCULT

estates on Earth that are built, at 
least in part, of star-crystal. At 
one time Terra Nova exported it 
in great quantities, but it was al- 
ways expensive to ship and has 
long since gone out of fashion. 

There was someone to meet me 
at the shuttlecraft — a darkly sat- 
urnine individual with an astonish- 
ing pair of moustaches. His name 
was Jean-Pierre Jackson and he 
was director of Terra Nova’s com- 
munications system. He told me 
to call him Pete. 

We rode into town in an asth- 
matic aircar that I suspect arrived 
with the original settlers. En 
route I learned that my duties 
would be light and pleasant, that 
Perigord was the beauty spot of 
the rim worlds and would some day 
rival Betelgeuse II and Benson’s 
Planet as a tourist attraction, 
and that I could lodge comfort- 
ably and conveniently in Perigord’s 
best (and only) inn, right next door 
to the Communications Center. 
The versatile Mr. Jackson was al- 
so, as it turned out, the innkeeper. 

The Perigord Inn was straight 
out of a fairytale, a sort of over- 
grown cottage of dark rose-col- 
ored star-crystal, with old-fash- 
ioned wooden shutters and an in- 
tricately carved front door. On 
either side of the steps were two 
small trees that were almost — but 
not quite — French lilacs. Their 
branches dripped with heavy 
snow-white blooms. 

“Lunchtime,” Pete Jackson ob- 



served. “Damn, I’m supposed to 
be at a meeting. Go in — the wife 
will take care of you.” 

The aircar departed, wheezing 
heavily. My landlord seemed to be 
a man of many pressing affairs. 
I opened the door and was swept 
inside on a tidal wave of hos- 
pitality. Nancy Jackson was a big 
woman, generous of hip and bust 
and spirit. I liked her immediately, 
though she left me a little breath- 
less. I lunched on the vaguely 
troutlike fish that abounds in the 
Sea of Perigord and I drank ex- 
cellent local wine. Nancy talked 
while I ate. She was an inexhaust- 
ible spring of local gossip, his- 
torical data and sociological ob- 
servation. Both she and her hus- 
band had been born on the planet, 
children of the earliest settlers. 
Pete was an organizer, a joiner — 
he had made his inn the hub 
around which the rest of Perigord 
revolved. Nancy was a talker but 
she was a listener, too. If any- 
thing happened in Perigord, Nan- 
cy knew about it. 

P RESENTLY my host returned, 
inquired after my comfort and 
well-being and took me next door 
to see the radio shack, a struc- 
ture almost as gorgeous as the 
inn, in infinitely varying purple 
hues. It took him only a few min- 
utes to show me my duties — I 
could see that I was going to have 
plenty of leisure time. At one 
time Perigord had been a busy 



86 



GALAXY 




port, shuttlecraft coming and go- 
ing around the clock with cargoes 
of star-crystal for the big freight- 
ers hanging in orbit. I could tell 
by the size of the radio shack that 
once there had been a substantial 
staff. Now I was alone, with lit- 
tle to occupy me. The freighters 
came infrequently and their visits 
were brief. 

Pete Jackson rushed off again, 
apparently in several directions. 

I locked up the radio shack with 
the key he had given me and set my 
wrist alarm in the improbable 
event that I was needed. Then I 
went out to explore this treasure 
of a world that 1 had blundered 
upon. 

The air was soft and full of the 
scent of blossoms. It was always 
like that on Terra Nova, all year 
round. To someone raised as I was 
in the north-temperate latitudes of 
Earth, it was like living perpetually 
in the second week of May. 

Nancy had given me a rough 
idea of the local geography. High 
up in the shadow of the hills were 
the great villas; whatever wealth 
remained on Terra Nova was con- 
centrated there. Most of the 
owners were retired people — ex- 
ecutives of the extractive indus- 
tries and the starship lines, who 
had visited the planet once or twice 
on business and loved it enough to 
return for good. 

Down by the waterfront, at the 
other extreme, was an artists’ col- 
ony and in between were the tidy 



tree-lined avenues where the rest 
of the populace lived — quarry 
workers, fishermen, shopkeepers 
and the like. 

After a while I wandered down 
to the wharf and sat with my toes in 
the water, watching the fisher- 
men. One of them was doing 
something complicated with a 
net. When he looked up and saw 
me he gave me a friendly wave and 
climbed up onto the wharf. 

“Hello," he said. “I’m Jock 
McLaren, And you, if I’m not mis- 
taken, will be our new radio oper- 
ator.” 

“Word gets around quickly,” I 
said. “I’ve only just come off the 
boat.” 

“It’s a small planet. Anybody 
new in town is big news. Especially 
if she’s female. Are you from 
Earth?” 

“Originally. I’ve wandered 
about a good bit since I left tech 
school.” 

“Can’t be all that long — since 
your schooldays, I mean.” 

I smiled, pleased at the compli- 
ment. “Six years. And a lot of dif- 
ferent planets— you’d be sur- 
prised.” 

“I’m astonished.” 

I glanced at him with curiosity. 
He looked like anyone’s idea of a 
seafaring man — tall, tanned, forty- 
ish, broad-shouldered and still lean 
about the middle — but somehow 
he didn’t sound like a fisherman. 

He asked me, “What brought 
you to Perigord?” 



STARCULT 



87 




“The name,” I said. “It sounded 
intriguing. The last place I worked 
was called Dry Lake, on Smith’s 
Planet. I was driven out after six 
months by dust and acute bore- 
dom. And what about you?” I 
asked him. “What brought you to 
Perigord?” 

“Same reason. I liked the 
name.” He grinned at me. He had 
a nice grin, open and cheerful and 
unassuming. He seemed a person 
who felt comfortable with himself. 

He stood up. “I’d better get go- 
ing. Maybe I’ll see you up at the 
shack. I help out sometimes when 
things get busy.” 

I WATCH ED his boat, the So- 
phia Prunikos, until she was out 
of sight around the curve of the 
bay. Then I wandered back up the 
slope to the Perigord Inn, through 
a late afternoon as mellow and 
golden as Shal’larakh wine. 

At dinner I said to Nancy, “I 
met an odd sort of fisherman to- 
day. Jock McSomething. Do you 
know him?” 

“Oh, have you met Jock al- 
ready? He’ll like you. He must 
find the local girls a bit dull.” 

I seized the chance to pump her 
for information. “He hasn’t al- 
ways been a fisherman, has he?” 
“Good heavens, no.” The idea 
seemed to amuse her. “You really 
don’t know who he is, then? No, of 
course you wouldn’t. And know- 
ing Jock, he’d hardly be likely to 
tell you. Suppose I called him 



Captain McLaren? Would that 
ring a bell?” 

I searched my memory. “The 
skipper of Venture II? Come on, 
Nancy, you’re joking.” 

She shook her head. “Jock 
McLaren was a famous man in his 
time. How many planets was it 
that Venture claimed for Earth? 
Dozens and dozens, anyway.” 
“What’s he doing on Perigord 
as a fisherman?” 

“Oh, he’s been retired for years. 
They pension off starship cap- 
tains before they’re forty. It’s a 
rough life. Anyway, he lost an eye 
on his last new planet. As for be- 
ing a fisherman, he’s perfectly 
happy at it. I’m sure he’d had all 
the fame and publicity he’s ever 
likely to want.” 

She laughed at my expression, 
which must have been a mixture of 
incredulity and awe. “You didn’t 
expect to meet a celebrity down 
there on the wharf, did you? Oh, I 
tell you, Anna, Perigord’s a curi- 
ous place. And getting curiouser 
every day.” 

Jock McLaren came around to 
the inn next day to ask if I would 
like to go fishing. It was to be a 
pleasure trip — he left his nets and 
heavy tackle stowed away and dug 
out a couple of light rods. 

“Jock,” I said as the afternoon 
wore on and I felt I knew him bet- 
ter, “don’t you miss space?” 

“Not so much. I like this life.” 
He gestured out over the silent 
emptiness of the Sea of Perigord.

“This is really what I was looking 
for when I went into space. Soli- 
tude, my own vessel, everything 
open and uncluttered?!— and 
quiet.” 

“Was space like that?” 

“Sometimes. At first it was. But 
after a while they expected me to 
act like a public figure — some 
sort of celebrity. I’ve got no talent 
for that kind of thing.” 

1 nodded, remembering what 
Nancy had told me. 

He added, “When they retired 
me from active duty they wanted 
me to sit behind a desk. But I like 
this better.” 

The sun was warm on our backs. 
A light breeze ruffled the water 
and stirred the trees along the 
shoreline. Those strange, carved, 
many-colored hills were outlined 
against a flawless sky. I had no 
trouble understanding his choice. 

Jock’s line went taut and he 
reeled in a vicious-looking crea- 
ture that bore some perverted re- 
semblance to a fish. I hoped I 
would not be expected to have it 
for dinner. 

I remembered something else 1 
had wanted to ask. 

“Nancy told me that Perigord 
was a curious place. Any idea what 
she meant?” 

He grinned. “I can guess. She 
wasted no time telling you all 
about my past, but I’ll bet she 
didn’t tell you about the Temple 
and the True Followers.” 

“The what?” 



“Did you happen to notice that 
big building up on the hill near the 
high-rent district?” 

“The sort of Purple Parthenon 
one? I could hardly miss it.” 

“That’s the Temple. It used to be 
a theater, when the town was 
booming. But lately it’s been 
taken over by a bunch of religious 
nuts.” 

“Why would Nancy keep quiet 
about a thing like that?” 

“When they first moved in our 
Nancy went up to take a look. She 
hates like hell to miss anything. 
Apparently she got interested 
enough to sign on as a member. 
Then she found out what was. ac- 
tually going on up there and she 
came tearing home like a scorched 
cat. Poor old Pete was scandal- 
ized — basically, he’s pretty much 
a puritan. Since then he’s done his 
damnedest to find an excuse to 
close down the place. Which ought 
to be easy enough, since he’s the li- 
censing inspector. But the 
Prophet is crafty — Pete has yet to 
catch him breaking a civic or- 
dinance.” 

“What exactly is going on?” 

He gave me a look of seraphic 
innocence. 

“Ask Nancy,” he said. 

And so I asked Nancy. I hadn’t 
thought her capable of so much in- 
dignation. 

“The TempleV' she said and 
looked as though she had swal- 
lowed something unpleasant. She 
added ominously, “If you’ve half 



STARCULT

the sense I think you have you’ll 
never put your nose near the place. 
The True Followers are the sort a 
decent girl shouldn’t even know 
about.” 

Poor Nancy. If she had told me 
that the pews were hard or the ser- 
vices long-winded — if she had said 
that the True Followers were ex- 
cessively puritanical or merely 
dull — I might have stayed away. 

T HE TEMPLE of the True Fol- 
lowers was purple and majes- 
tic. Its glittering facade was shaded 
delicately from palest lavender to 
a deep and glowing violet. The 
architecture was a style I had 
come to recognize as Perigor- 
dian Civic --solid, squarish and 
exuberantly colorful. It was sur- 
rounded by a sort of terrace with 
walks and benches and the cus- 
tomary display of fountains, 
stylized lamp standards and shrub- 
bery. The front entrance was 
flanked by a brace of muses — or 
possibly they were graces — who 
inspected me coldly out of sculp- 
tured eyes. Something was quite 
odd about their expressions — it 
bothered me but I could not name 
what it was. 

A discreet notice to one side of 
the entrance said, Public Service, 
Day 10, 8th hr. I glanced at my 
watch — the hour was 7:85. I sat 
down on a bench to wait. By seven 
ninety-five clusters of people 
were standing patiently outside 
the entrance. Only a few were 



young, 1 noticed. Most were well- 
dressed, carefully coiffed matrons. 
Promptly at eight hours the doors 
swung open. There was no ante- 
room. We stepped directly into 
an enormous, high-ceilinged hall. 

The place was not at all what I 
had expected from my limited ex- 
perience of temples. It was more 
like a very elaborate set designed 
for a tri-di historical. 

Massive beams arched across the 
high theater ceiling. They looked 
impressively old, as though they 
had in fact been blackened by the 
hearth fires of centuries. At one 
end of the hall was the stage, which 
now served as a kind of dais, with 
heavy velvet drapes and a cush- 
ioned, canopied throne. At the 
other end was an enormous stone 
fireplace. 

The walls on three sides were 
hung with tapestried forests 
where stags and hounds, yeoman 
and unicorns pranced and ca- 
vorted. The fourth wall, illogical- 
ly I thought, was mirrored from 
floor to ceiling. It caught and re- 
flected the polychromatic light 
that slanted from above. I looked 
up and saw that high clerestory 
windows filled with translucent 
bricks of star-crystal had been 
cut into the theater walls. 

The theater seats were gone; 
around the margins of the hall, in- 
stead, were settles, intricately 
decorated, with wide seats and 
solid legs. They must have been re- 
productions but they were good 



90 



GALAXY 




ones. The dark wood looked hand- 
carved and had the mellow glow of 
antiquity. They were piled high 
with silk and velvet cushions in 
rich colors — crimson and old 
gold, amethyst and lapis lazuli. 

The floor, what I could see of it, 
was paved with star-crystal and 
scattered everywhere were deep- 
piled rugs and animal skins, singly 
and in opulent heaps. 

The hall was starting to fill. A 
group of musicians came in 
through a rear door and stood on 
the dais. They were dressed in tu- 
nics and tights, in the clear cool 
colors of old enamels — greens 
and torquois and cobalt blue, 
with here and there a streak of gold 
or scarlet. They began to play 
something medieval and proces- 
sional, full of trumpets and per- 
cussion. A deep hush fell over the 
congregation. Slowly and with 
great dignity a solitary figure 
moved out onto the dias. 

W HEN I saw his face I must 
have gasped aloud, for I re- 
member that the dowager on the 
next seat turned around to stare at 
me. The jaw was heavier and the 
hair thinner. The dull gray gar- 
ment of the purification party 
was gone and in its place was a 
spectacular gold-embroidered 
crimson robe. But I recognized 
at once the fleshy lips, the un- 
healthy pallor of the skin and 
those cold, compelling gray eyes. 

I knew then that Nancy had been 



right. This was the moment for me 
to escape as she had escaped back 
to the safety of the Perigord Inn. 
But something — curiosity or sur- 
prise or fascination — held me to 
my seat and I listened. 

Thomas Howard was a man well 
into his thirties now. His voice had 
lost none of its richness and reso- 
nance. Maturity, I thought, had 
given him polish and sub- 
tlety — but more than that, it had 
intensified the power of his will, 
the furious strength of conviction 
that flowed from him like a palpa- 
ble force. I told myself that it was 
an illusion, some sort of stage 
trick that he had developed and 
perfected over the years. 1 had not 
forgotten the look on the face of 
poor Jocelyn, that day in the li- 
brary. I knew that the man was 
cold-blooded, amoral, a charlatan 
and quite possibly a dangerous 
and naive psychotic. 

And yet as I sat there I was 
caught up^involuntarily — in a 
kind of hypnosis that gripped us 
all. 

What was it he said. It’s hard af- 
ter so many years to remember. 

“The perfect knowledge,” he be- 
gan, “the ultimate freedom of the 
spirit, is this; that we are unafraid 
to stray into those actions whose 
very names are unmentionable. 
For when the spirit is committed 
to the realm of the transmundane 
deity it is indifferent to the nat- 
ural world. And how shall our souls 
transcend the corruption of the 



STARCULT 



91 




body? It is written that we must 
render the flesh to the flesh and the 
spirit to the spirit. We must render 
to nature its own, for thereby we 
shall exhaust its powers. When we 
have made all experience ours, 
when we have performed all ac- 
tions and looked unabashed on all 
forbidden things, then shall we 
have paid our debt and our souls 
shall find release. 

“For you who are the True Fol- 
lowers there can be no corruption. 
For as gold sunk in filth will not 
lose its beauty but will preserve 
its own nature, so nothing can 
change our spiritual essence.” 

I lost the thread of his argument 
as he wandered through a be- 
wildering maze of dogma and 
symbolism, full of references to 
transmigration and the acosmic 
self, the Seven Spheres and the 
Poimandres of Hermes Trismeg- 
istus. 

Now, as I write them down, his 
words seem tenuous and obscure. 
But when one heard him speak one 
soon stopped listening to the 
words. One was aware only of that 
sonorous, vibrant voice of his^na 
voice like honey and cello strings 
and thundef^that rolled out over 
the hall in great engulfing waves. 
For a few bewildering moments 
the minds, the thoughts of the 
crowd — of the placid matrons in 
their farrlgo furs and zoid-jewels, 
of the scattering of cynical young 
people from the artists’ col- 
ony — were drawn together and co- 



alesced. I was caught up in it too. I 
could not help myself, none of us 
could. We were no longer in- 
dividuals. We were a mindless ex- 
tension of Thomas Howard’s will. 

WI\ON’T go yet, Anna — it’s 

"been a long time.” He caught 
my hand as I filed out with the 
others past the big carved doors. I 
was surprised and in spite of my- 
self a little flattered that he re- 
membered me. 

“You will stay and have a word 
with me, won’t you? It’s not often 
an old friend from Earth turns up 
in my congregation.” His man- 
ner had changed. There was still 
that air of proud self-sufficiency, 
but he seemed less arrogant, less 
coldly cynical then I remembered, 
more like the conventional clergy- 
man greeting his flock. But then 
he gave me that small, half- 
amused, half-mocking smile and 
I sensed that behind the veneer 
he had not changed at all. 

My instincts told me to jerk my 
hand free, to tear my gaze away 
from his, to turn and run. But it 
seemed an uncivilized way to be- 
have. A nd so I nodded mutely 
and when he said, “Come into my 
office, where we can talk — ” I fol- 
lowed him. 

We stepped abruptly out of the 
twelfth century into the twenty- 
second. His office was, quite un- 
expectedly, severe and business- 
like. No carvings here, or 
enameled inlays, but plain para-

wood paneling, a large square 
desk, some modern chairs, a small 
computer and a microfilm cabi- 
net. 

He drew up a chair for me — a 
gesture that belonged to the new 
Thomas Howard. “Now, my dear 
Anna, what have you been doing 
lor eight years?” 

I told him briefly and then said, 
"What made you change your ap- 
proach?” 

At twenty-seven 1 was still an 
abrupt and tactless creature. Es- 
pecially with people I disliked. 

The single eyebrow rose in mock 
surprise. “I beg your pardon?” 

“I mean you were having such a 
whale of a good time taking over 
student governments. After you 
got tired of our campus-^how 
many others did you infiltrate? 
About half a dozen, wasn’t it? And 
always a bigger one.” 

He smiled. “Quite right. Just be- 
fore 1 left Earth 1 had a nice toe- 
hold on the London School of 
Economics.” 

“Why did you leave?” 

“The usual story — the govern- 
ment stepped in. I make govern- 
ments nervous. The problem has 
always been to keep them from 
getting nervous before I’m ready 
to take over. They see an organi- 
zation like the ones I’ve 
created — strongly motivated, co- 
hesive, single-minded — and they 
know what’s going to happen to 
their own shaky administra- 
tions.” 



“So they drive you out.” 

“Exactly. Seems unfair, doesn’t 
it?” 

“And now you’re trying to sneak 
back from a different direction.” 

“Very intelligent of you, Anna.” 

“Do you think this time it will 
work?” 

“I’m positive it will. It’s more 
than just a matter of a different 
approach, a diversionary tac- 
tic. Over the last eight years I’ve 
begun to realize what sort of 
power I possess and how to use it. I 
could always influence peo- 
ple^now I’ve learned to control 
them absolutely.” 

I said, “You’re like the old rab- 
ble-rousers — Hitler and Stalin and 
the rest.” 

“Perhaps. But they ultimately 
failed. I’m not going to fail. And I 
don’t think they fully realized 
what power they had — or pos- 
sibly they had it in a lesser de- 
gree.” 

“Why should you tell me all this? 
Aren’t you afraid I’ll go to the 
authorities?” 

He laughed. “Go ahead. They 
can’t stop me. No one can stop me 
now.” He took me by the arm, 
led me back out into the great hall. 
“Look at this. It cost a great deal 
of money. Where do you suppose I 
got it?” 

“From your congregation? They 
looked pretty well-off, I thought.” 

“Indeed they are. Those women 
are wives of retired spaceline 
executives, heads of industry.

And now others are coming in 
from off-planet. Soon there’ll be 
an influx of True Followers from 
all over the galaxy to Terra Nova. 
And when enough are here, my 
religious organization will be 
subtly transformed into a polit- 
ical organization.” 

“But what do your followers be- 
lieve in? What was your sermon 
all about?” 

“Ah, that’s the beauty of it, 
Anna. I’ve found the perfect be- 
lief, ideally suited to imperfect 
human nature. The perfect 
knowledge is the realization 
that we are unafraid to stray into 
those actions whose very names 
are unmentionable. You’ve 
heard of Carpocrates?” 

“No,” I said. “At least I don’t 
think so.” 

“Your education is sadly lack- 
ing. Carpocrates was a second- 
century Alexandrian, a gnostic. 
His particular Christian heresy 
believed in transmigration — that 
the soul must pass through sev- 
eral bodies before it can be freed 
from the physical world. And be- 
fore we can obtain this release 
from the flesh and pass into the 
realm of the spirit we have an obli- 
gation to commit every kind of 
act, to render to nature its own. 
Through sin we shall achieve sal- 
vation. The Carpocratians and 
other similar sects were known, I 
believe, as the Licentious Gnostics 
or the Christian Libertines.” 

“Oh,” I said. I understood. “In 



other words, doctrinally licensed 
orgies.” 

“Don’t look so shocked, Anna. 
But if you approach it realistical- 
ly you’ll see that it’s a very sen- 
sible and attractive religion. I of- 
fer my followers the best of all 
possible worlds — the satisfaction 
of the spirit, the senses and the 
flesh.” 

“I think I’d better be going 
now,” I said. 

He laughed. “Poor Anna, I’ve 
frightened you off again. Never 
mind. You’re not the First woman 
to disappear through that door in 
mortal terror. But you’ll come 
back — the others did.” 

Not everyone, I thought fierce- 
ly. Not Nancy and not / . 

It was true I was frightened. It 
was not the peculiar rites of the 
True Followers that disturbed 
me — I already knew what Thomas 
Howard was. But as I made my 
way through the great opulent hall 
I had a momentary vision of wine 
flagons and velvet robes scattered 
carelessly among the pillows — I 
heard the sensuous rhythms of 
rebec and drum and saw torch- 
light glinting on naked limbs. And 
I knew that what had been easy for 
Nancy was going to be difficult 
for me. 

As I left the temple I again met 
the stony gaze of the two graces. 
And finally I realized why their 
faces had bothered me. The 
mouths, the set of the eyes and the 
angle of the brows were subtly dis-

torted into expressions of sheer, 
unbridled lasciviousness. 

Ill 

A FTER that I spent most of my 
time around the inn and the ra- 
dio shack or on Jock McLaren’s 
boat and feigned a great disin- 
terest in the lights that flickered 
on the hill in the early morning 
hours. 

But Thomas Howard was not 
easily ignored. I came back to the 
inn one day to find the place in an 
uproar. A Rigelian fisherman 
was pounding on the bar with his 
lists and shouting furiously into 
Pete Jackson’s ear. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked 
Nancy, who was standing well out 
of the way in a corner. 

“His wife is a True Follower. He 
found out why she was doing 
church work till the wee small 
hours.” 

“Oh,” I said. 

Perigordians are on the whole an 
easygoing lot and inclined to 
forgive and forget, but on Rigel II 
ihe moral climate is more severe 
and honor is defended at blaster 
point. 

The man was almost incoherent 
with rage, but I gathered that he 
was appealing to Pete in his 
capacity as license inspector to 
close down the Temple and as 
magistrate to throw Howard into 
the nearest dungeon. 

“Have you been to the police?” 



Pete was asking him. Pete looked 
desperate. 

“A pack of imbeciles. They say 
they can’t touch Howard — he 
hasn’t broken any law.” He glared 
at Pete as though holding him 
personally responsible. “I ask you, 
is seducing a man’s wife not a 
crime?” 

“Not in Perigord,” Pete said. 
“Inadequate sanitation is a 
crime, yes, but not seduction.” He 
added bleakly: “And the temple’s 
plumbing, I regret to say, is be- 
yond reproach.” 

“Then,” said the Rigelian, “I 
will take matters into my own 
hands. I have tried to go through 
the proper channels — I cannot be 
held responsible for what may 
happen now.” 

We stood outside the inn, the 
Jacksons and Jock and I, and 
watched the Rigelians storm the 
hill. They were a sizeable 
community and its entire male 
population had turned out — sturdy, 
unimaginative fishermen who con- 
sidered the virtue of their wives and 
daughters at stake. Their declared 
intention was to burn the Temple 
to the ground and beat the Proph- 
et into protoplasm. 

The town constabulary — all 
three of them — had prudently re- 
moved itself from the scene. We 
watched for a long time for the 
erupting flames and listened for 
the Screams of anguish — but noth- 
ing happened. 

I said to Jock, “Do you think 



STARCULT 



95 




he’ll talk his way out of this one?” 
“Why not?” I think you under- 
estimate the Prophet. These peo- 
ple — messiahs, dictators or what- 
ever you want to call them — fol- 
low a pattern. They deal in emo- 
tion, not reason. If you approach 
them in a state of blind fury it 
serves them as well as wide-eyed 
admiration. Possibly better. It’s 
the involvement, the emotional 
arousal, that’s important. It 
makes people accept leadership.” 

“I hope you’re wrong,” I said. 
“You make him sound invincible. 
He frightens me enough as it is.” 
Nothing continued happening on 
the hill. But after a while the 
Rigelian mob straggled back, its 
ranks diminished by about one- 
third. The offended husband, I 
noticed, was not among the re- 
turnees. 

“What happened?” we shouted 
as soon as they were within 
earshot. 

They looked like men to whom 
an unspeakable injustice had been 
done. One of them said, “That 
damn fool, that Joe — ” He threw 
his arms into the air and gazed 
skyward as though seeking divine 
explanation. “He’s been con- 
verted.” 

S OON after that the alien ship 
arrived and for a while at least 
we forgot about Thomas Howard 
and his temple. 

It came one afternoon while Per- 
igord lay basking and somnolent 



under a golden sun. I was sitting in 
a contented stupor in the bow of 
the Sophia Prunikos, trailing one 
hand in the tepid water and idly 
wondering why Jock McLaren had 
never married. 

Jock said, “We’ve got guests.” 

I gazed at him blankly from un- 
der my sun hat, wondering what he 
was talking about. Then my eyes 
followed his stare and I saw the 
small saucer-shaped vessel drifting 
silently toward the landing field, 

“Damn,” I said and looked at 
my wrist, thinking I had forgot- 
ten my alarm. I hadn’t. Idiotically 
I held the timepiece to my ear and 
shook it. 

“Relax,” Jock said. “If they had 
needed any help to come in they 
would have waited for you.” 

“Whose is it? Do you recognize 
it?” 

He shook his head. “It's no de- 
sign I’ve ever seen before.” 

“Could it be a lifeboat?” 

“It’s possible. But it’s not from 
an Earth craft. 

The ship had disappeared be- 
hind the trees, Jock turned the 
Sophia Prunikos toward shore. 

We took it for granted the ship 
had come down on the landing 
field near Perigord — it was the 
only one still in use. But half the 
population of Perigord — the half 
with aircars — had been out to look 
and by the time we reached the inn 
the report was back: the Perigord 
field was empty. 

A half-dozen smaller fields were 



96 



GALAXY 




scattered across the planet, relics 
of the star-crystal boom. They 
were probably overgrown with 
weeds but all of them, I remem- 
bered, had control towers 
equipped with video scanners. I 
could hook into any one of them 
from the main communications 
room and chances were they still 
worked. When spare parts are 
three months away, circuits are 
built to last. 

Aircars were shooting off in all 
directions. Things had been quiet 
up on the hill lately and Perigord 
was ripe for fresh excitement. 
Elbowing our way through the 
crowd, we headed for the radio 
shack. We had no trouble picking 
up the ship. It had come down on 
an old field near an abandoned 
quarry about two hundred miles 
from Perigord. The scanner was 
not much use for fine detail, but 
we could see clearly enough the odd 
disk-shaped vessel in the center of 
the field. It showed no sign of life, 
human or otherwise. 

We sent word to the police and 
militia that we had located the 
ship and watched until they ar- 
rived on the field — Perigord’s 
three policemen and a dozen or so 
militiamen. There wasn’t much 
they could do. Several of them 
walked in a slow circle around the 
ship, surveying its Unbroken, enig- 
matic surface. 

By now a ring of onlookers had 
gathered. Unobserved by the 
police, a small boy was throwing 



stones at the ship. Periodically an- 
other aircar would arrive and spill 
out a cargo of children and picnic 
baskets. Then the ship’s shadow 
lengthened; the light turned soft 
and its gold deepened. Some of the 
spectators lost interest and went 
home. The others, content to 
await developments, spread 
blankets at the edge of the field. 

And at last, in the drowsy peace 
of late afternoon, a hatch opened 
in the side of the ship. 

At my ear Jock said, “Can’t you 
get in any closer?” 1 fiddled with 
the knobs. “That’s better.” 

I couldn’t get a closeup and I 
wasn’t sorry. Our visitors were 
about five feet high and roughly 
ovoid — or more accurately, acorn- 
shaped — with the broad side up- 
permost. Their surface color was a 
sort of blotchy swamp-brown and 
covered with a network of raised 
lines like distended blood-vessels. 
They had four limbs or appen- 
dages. A couple of feet up from 
their conical bottoms ran a long 
horizontal gash that looked like a 
crocodile’s mouth. There was no 
head, as such. Rather, the whole 
creature seemed to consist of a 
horrible head. The huge eyes, posi- 
tioned some inches above the 
mouth-gash, had slits a foot long 
for pupils and glared like search- 
lights. 

T HE police and militia joined 
forces and moved slowly in 



STARCULT 



97 




from the edge of the field. An air- 
car, impatient for a closer look, 
flew in and dropped low over the 
ship. The aliens seemed to notice 
this — perhaps they were dis- 
turbed by the noise or the slight 
vibration. The upper parts of their 
bodies tilted backward. The air- 
car veered, shot across the field 
and crashed into the trees. 

The advancing militia halted. 
Abruptly. At this point somebody 
remembered his field radio. 

“Number Four field to 
Perigord.” 

“Perigord here,” I said. 

“Can you see what’s going on 
out here?” 

“More or less. We saw the air- 
car crash. Our visitors do that?” 

“Can’t tell. Could have been 
mechanical trouble." 

“Quite a coincidence,” 1 said. 
“Could they be armed?” 

“Not as far as we can make out. 
We’re clearing the civilians away. 
The captain wants to try to com- 
municate. Damned if I know 
how.” 

I looked at the screen. The po- 
lice were moving along the fringe 
of trees, rounding up the scattered 
knots of people and herding them 
back to their aircars. 

“We’re moving up again,” the 
signalman siad. “Guess the CO 
wants to try sign language. Hang 
on. I'm getting something^what 
the hell? Perigord, we’re commu- 
nicating with them — I’m getting 
pictures, images — ” 



“You’re getting what?” 

“Mental images — telepathy. The 
globs are telepathic. This is going 
to be garbled, but I’ll try to relay it 
you. They call themselves — the 
best I can do is something like 
Bhak’zaa. They come — from an- 
other galaxy, that part’s clear 
enough. Now they’re telling us 
why they’re here.” There was a 
lengthy pause. Then the militia- 
man’s voice again, speaking very 
rapidly. “They’re overpopulated. 
They need room to expand. They 
want — no, that’s not right — they 
intend to plant a colony here. This 
is the scouting party. They’ve been 
running tests — conditions are ideal. 
For globs. Bhak’zaa.” Another 
pause. “Here are their terms. We 
can leave. Or we can stay and live 
in — reservations, ghettos, some- 
thing like that. If we mind our own 
business and keep our mouths 
shut. Otherwise — I won’t trans- 
late the otherwise. The CO is re- 
fusing their terms. He’s telling the 
globs we’ll hit them with every- 
thing we’ve got.” 

“Half a dozen rusty blasters 
and the courthouse cannon,’’ 
Jock remarked. 

“More communication from the 
Bhak’zaa — resistance — resistance 
is useless. They defend themselves 
the same way they speak — tele- 
pathically. I don’t understand 
what they mean by that, but I get 
an impression of total self-con- 
fidence. They don’t expect any 
interference and won’t tolerate 



98 



GALAXY 




any. The captain says to keep 
moving up — I think the idea is to 
make them show their hand. I’ve 
lost contact with them now. 
They’ve withdrawn.” Then I heard 
a sharp intake of breath and he 
said, “Oh, my God." 

I looked at the screen. Two men 
were on their knees, hands clutch- 
ing the sides of their heads. 
“Number Four field, what — ” 

“I don't know. Wait a minute.” 

I heard him shouting a question. 
“They’ve hit two men — somehow. 
Their minds are gone. No speech, 
no response — nothing.” Then he 
added, “There’s the order to 
fire — ” It was the last intelligible 
thing he said. I saw the line of 
raised weapons, saw the Bhak’zaa 
standing unarmed and apparently 
defenseless before their ship. But 
the sharp singing whine of the 
blasters never came. I stared, in- 
stead, at a field scattered with 
limp, jerking, rag-doll figures and 
heard a voice — the militiaman’s 
voice — that gibbered and babbled 
horribly in my ears. 

T HERE was a mass meeting 
that night in the Interstellar 
Order of Space-Farers Hall. I 
came late, for I had stayed to 
watch the alien ship as long as any 
light remained. As far as I could 
tell, the entire population of Peri- 
gord was in the hall and just about 
everyone from the outlying fish- 
ing hamlets. 

Lined up on chairs across the 



empty stage were the mayor, the 
chief of police and the resident 
psychiatrist from the Perigord 
General. On the wall behind them 
hung a fading banner, the flag of 
Federated Earth. I felt a twinge of 
panic as I remembered how very 
far away we were from Earth and 
from the Federation’s paternal 
arms. 

We were told what we already 
knew too well — that the militia’s 
meager supply of short-range 
weapons was quite useless against 
the Bhak’zaa, that any human 
being who moved in close enough 
to fire a blaster could expect to 
have his mind seared inside his 
skull. 

The crowd was tense, restless, 
belligerent. It was too soon for 
them to accept the situation as 
hopeless. They insisted that there 
must be, there had to be, a way out. 
There were plenty of suggestions 
from the floor. Most of them were 
far-fetched and all of them were 
impractical. 

In a corner of the room where a 
group of artists and bohemians 
had gathered a girl rose to her feet. 
She was gentle-eyed, unworldly in 
sandals and a long burlap shift. 
Her face was flushed. She seemed 
angry. 

“Don’t you know why the 
Bhak’zaa attacked you?” she de- 
manded of the crowd. “They came 
to us and we welcomed them as 
human beings have always 
greeted alien races — with soldiers 



STARCULT 



99 




and guns. They didn’t make the 
first warlike move — we did. They 
saw the weapons and felt all those 
hostile emanations, so of course 
they had to protect themselves.” 

I thought this was preposterous, 
but some of the faces in the 
audience wore expressions of 
sympathy. 

“Let us go out,” the girl said and 
with an embracing motion of her 
arms indicated those who sat 
around her. “We will go with emp- 
ty hands and with love in our 
hearts. The Bhak’zaa will know at 
once we come in a spirit of peace 
and friendship. You’ll see— we'll 
succeed where the soldiers and the 
blasters and the bombs have 
failed.” 

In the end the meeting decided 
to let her and her people try their 
system. There wasn’t much point 
in trying to stop them and I sup- 
pose there were those in the crowd 
who regarded them as small loss in 
any case. 

They were found the next day 
and brought back to Perigord 
empty-eyed, whimpering and near- 
ly dead of thirst and exhaustion. 
Their arms and legs were scratched 
and bleeding. They had been stum- 
bling blindly through the under- 
brush. 

After that we could do little 
but watch and wait. On the third 
evening I got up from the board 
stiff and exhausted, a nagging 
headache behind my eyes. I 
looked at Jock, slumped in the 



chair beside me. A stranger might 
not have noticed the fatigue and 
tension in his face, but they were 
there. He also looked withdrawn 
and remote. I wondered what he 
was thinking. 

He reached out and caught my 
arm. “Come on,” he said, “We’ll 
go see Pete and have a beer.” 

The inn was crowded and noisy. 
We had trouble finding a place to 
sit. Then a party of Rigelian fish- 
ermen spotted us and called us over 
to their table. One of them. Bren 
Tharssen, I had met before — he 
was a friend of Jock’s. 

“Evening, Miss Perry,” he said. 
The others moved over silently to 
make room. Considering the 
Rigelian temperament and the 
number of empty beer jugs on the 
table, they seemed unnaturally 
subdued. 

Bren Tharssen said, “You’ll be 
leaving too. Miss Perry?” 

He took me by surprise. 
“Leaving? Perigord? I haven’t 
even thought about it yet.” It was 
the truth. “Do you think it will 
come to that?” 

He smiled sourly. “I figure it 
will.” Staring into his beer, he 
said, “I remember when I first came 
to this planet — must be going on 
twenty years ago — the wharves were 
infested with little rodents, like 
ground-squirrels. They were 
friendly little devils — made good 
pets. But they were a damned 
nuisance. They chewed up the nets 
gnawed on the ropes.” There was a 



100 



GALAXY 




pause while he hoisted his mug. Set- 
ting it down, empty, he added, “So 
we killed them all off poisoned 
them. Wouldn’t have done them any 
good to sit up and look cute or to bite 
us on the shins, either. They were a 
nuisance, so we got rid of them. 
Now its our turn. Only I’m not wait- 
int—d’m going back to Rigel II.” 

“Jock?” I said. “Are you 
leaving?” 

“May have to. But it won’t make 
a hell of a lot of difference, in the 
long run.” 

Bren Tharssen looked up. “How 
do you mean?” 

“Think about it. Terra Nova is a 
very small planet. When the 
Bhak’zaa have filled it up with 
their surplus population — which 
shouldn’t take long — they’re going 
to be looking around for more terri- 
tory. Their metabolisms must be 
pretty much like ours — they want an 
Earth-type planet.” He emptied the 
beer pitcher into his mug. “Rigel II 
is an Earth-type planet. So are all 
the other worlds that the human 
race has established itself on.” 

“Including Earth,” I said. I felt 
sick. 

“Including Earth. So where are 
we going to run?” 

“Bloody hell,” muttered a sad- 
faced Rigellian sitting next to me. 
“If you’ll pardon my language. 
Miss.” 

A long silence fell. Then, at a 
table behind me, a mug descended 
with a reverberating crash. I turned 
around to stare. A set of steel-col- 



ored, slightly protuberant eyes 
bored into mine. Their owner was a 
large, balding square-jawed man of 
military bearing. He had a small, 
precisely clipped gray moustache 
and a magenta face. 

“By God,” he said with furious 
dignity. “By God- they’ll never 
take Earth!” 

One of the Rigelians, the drunk- 
est one, started to laugh. His neigh- 
bor elbowed him sharply in the 
ribs and he lapsed into a gloomy 
silence. 

Jock said mildly, “Probably not. 
Not this two-man scouting party. 
However — ” he reached up as 
Nancy sped past, relieved her of a 
full jug — “we haven’t seen their 
navy.” 

IV 

A S THE evening wore on, the at- 
mosphere at our table came more 
and more to resemble that of a 
wake. After a while the red-faced 
gentleman brought his chair over 
and joined us. He was the only one 
among us not prepared to admit 
defeat. He was a retired colonial 
administrator from Aldebaran VI 
and he had a low opinion of the 
capabilities — mental, moral and 
military — of extraterrestrial races. 

“It’s small wonder the local 
militia couldn’t handle the job,” he 
told us. “Rotten organiza- 
tion — rotten.” He punctuated this 
remark by rapping his mug-bottom 
smartly against the tabletop. “But 



STARCULT 



101 




send in a company of regulars from 
Earth. Ha! Then we’lt see the 
beggars take to their heels.” A small 
shower of beersuds flew over the 
table. 

Bren Tharssen said, “It takes 
three months to send a ship from 
Earth. We could all be vegetables 
by then.” 

“Provided,” Jock added, “that 
Federated Earth is willing to send 
troops. Why should they risk pro- 
voking an interstellar war? Terra 
Nova is about the least important 
backwater planet in the galaxy.” 

“But you said yourself, the 
Bhak'zaa won’t stop with one 
planet.” 

“Try to tell that to the Feder- 
ation,” Jock said. 

Some sort of commotion was go- 
ing on at the door. A party of late 
drinkers had just arrived and 
apparently they brought news of 
fresh developments. The word went 
quickly around the room. 

“The Prophet is going out to 
meet the Bhak’zaa,” 

At first I thought it was a joke. 
“Someone,” I said, “has a strange 
sense of humor.” 

“Wait a minute,” Jock said. He 
rose from the table. I followed him 
over to the crowd in the doorway. 
Everyone was talking at once, but 
a few facts emerged out of the gener- 
al uproar. En route to the inn, the 
latecomers had met a group of True 
Followers on their way home from a 
mass gathering at the Temple. 

There had been no orgy that 



night. Thomas Howard had led his 
flock in prayer and meditation 
and afterward made his an- 
nouncement: at dawn, alone and 
armed only with the cosmic 
powers of the transmundane deity 
(a phrase that may or may not have 
been garbled in transmission) he 
was going out to meet the alien in- 
vaders. 

I remember that Jock took me 
by the shoulders and steered me 
gently but firmly out of the pub 
and toward the stairs that led up 
to my room. What with the beer 
and the general excitement, I 
was more than a little glassy-eyed. 

“Bedtime,” he said. “Set your 
alarm. Our day’s going to start 
early.” 

I slept very badly that night. In 
the few hours that remained till 
dawn I fled for an eternity among 
the naked stars, pursued through 
space by something 1 could not 
escape. Sometimes it was the 
Bhak’zaa that slithered noisomely 
behind me, leaving silver trails of 
slime across the planets. Some- 
times the hunter bore the face of 
Thomas Howard — and as I ran it 
was as though my feet were caught 
in quicksand and I could not 
move, for those cold hypnotic eyes 
drew me inexorably back. And at 
other times 1 was trapped be- 
tween the two, the aliens and the 
prophet, and boxed on both sides 
by whirling nebulae, so that there 
was nowhere I could run. I knew 
that somewhere in that black void 



102 



GALAXY 




Jock McLaren was piloting the 
Sophia Prunikos and that if I 
could only reach her I would be 
safe. But try as I might 1 could 
never find her. 

I AWOKE in a half-lit room, 
throat dry and my heart pound- 
ing. Nancy was standing beside the 
bed. She had shaken me awake 
and now she was holding out a cup 
of coffee. 

“Come on,” she said. “It’s 
nearly daylight. Jock’s down- 
stairs. He says you’d best get a 
move on and why didn’t you set 
the alarm the way he told you to?” 

1 swallowed the coffee. As 1 
emerged into reality I realized 
that most of the pounding had set- 
tled in my head. I walked down- 
stairs very carefully, for fear of 
jarring something. 

Jock said encouragingly, “You 
look like hell.” 

My nightmare was still fresh in 
my mind and in spite of the re- 
mark I fought a wild desire to 
latch on to him and hang on for 
dear life. 

“Want any breakfast?” Jock 
asked. I shook my head. The 
thought revolted me. 

“Come on then — over to the 
radio shack.” 

1 stumbled along with him. “Has 
Howard left?” 

“Not yet. He’s still up at the 
Temple— sacrificing virgins or 
whatever he does at times like 
this.” 



“Then what’s the rush?” 

“Because the minute the Prophet 
sets out for that landing field the 
entire population of Perigord is 
going to be pounding on your 
door, looking for a ringside seat. 
We are going inside and we are 
securely locking the door before 
the rush starts.” 

By this time the Prophet and his 
flock had moved outside the Tem- 
ple. We could hear the distant 
sound of drums and trumpets 
floating down from the hill. Jock 
scribbled a No Admittance sign 
and tacked it to the door. We 
locked ourselves in and turned on 
the coffee pot. 

The music grew steadily louder 
until the air was resplendent with 
fanfares and flourishes and the 
sprightly jangle of tambourines. 
It sounded absurdly cheerful — al- 
most exuberant. But I suppose the 
sounding brass and tinkling cym- 
bals were meant to encourage the 
troops— it was not yet a time for 
dirges. 

We went to the window. Jock 
said, “You’ve got a visitor.” 

A small chill ran down my spine. 
The procession had stopped out- 
side the radio shack. 

Someone tapped gently at the 
door. I opened it and stared out 
at Thomas Howard standing 
quietly on the step in the gray light 
of pre-dawn. He was a splendid 
figure, draped from neck to feet in 
deep blue velvet crusted heavily 
with silver threads. He wore a 



STARCULT 



103 




small cool smile. I could almost 
believe he was enjoying himself. 

“Hello, Anna,’’ he said. “May I 
come in?” 

I hesitated. “I’ll come out.” I 
was oddly disturbed at the 
thought of his entering the radio 
shack. His smile broadened 
slightly. Why did I always have 
this wretched feeling that he could 
see the thoughts revolving in my 
skull? 

He said, “They tell me you can 
watch the field on video. I thought 
I’d stop to pay my regards and let 
you know I’m leaving.” 

“Thank you,” I said stupidly. 
Was this his way of saying good- 
bye? I wondered what was going 
on behind those impenetrable 
eyes. 

“You haven’t been back to see 
me, Anna. I had hoped by now to 
number you among my flock.” 
His eyes looked past me and 
through the open doorway. They 
rested very briefly on Jock McLar- 
en placidly drinking coffee, his feet 
propped on my desk. 

“But you’ve had other in- 
terests,” Howard went on in the 
same gently chiding tone. “Never 
mind, Anna, there’ll be plenty of 
time later on. One of these days 
you’ll come back to the Temple.” 

One of these days? I wondered 
how many days were left to any of 
us in Perigord. 

“Goodbye, Thomas,” I said. 
“Good luck.” 

“No,” he said. “I didn’t come to 



say goodbye.” After a pause he 
added: “You’ve always inter- 
ested me, Anna. You have a mind 
of your own. I like that. It pro- 
vides a challenge. I decided some 
time ago that when I come to take 
over there will be a place for you 
in my government. Think about 
it.” 

I shook my head. “You know 
my answer to that.” 

He turned to go. 

“We’ll see,” he said. 



I WATCHED the procession 
move off, a bright stream of 
sound and color in the pale gray 
morning. They were all in cere- 
monial dress, the men as gaudy as 
birds in their jewel-colored tights 
and tunics, the women in long, 
high-waisted, supple gowns of silk 
and velvet. 

At the bottom of the street was a 
small paved courtyard, a sort of 
unofficial town square. Here they 
halted again. The Followers 
gathered about the Prophet in a 
semi-circle, facing in the general 
direction of the field where the 
aliens waited, and began to chant 
the final prayer before battle. The 
chanting went on for a long time. I 
went in and shut the door. I found 
that I was shivering slight- 
ly — whether from nerves or from 
the chill air I found it hard to say. 
Jock poured me a fresh cup of cof- 
fee. 

“Dragging it out a hell of a time,

aren’t they?” he said sourly. “May- 
be they’re hoping the Bhak’zaa will 
get bored and go away.” 

It was still about an hour to 
dawn, but the light was getting 
better. 1 sat down at the board and 
switched on the screen. In a min- 
ute or two I had a good clear pic- 
ture of the landing field. The great 
silver disk was visible, but there 
was no other sign of the Bhak’zaa. 

I said, “Jock, why do you think 
he’s doing this?" 

“You know him better than I 
do. I can only judge by what you’ve 
told me. Didn’t you ask him?” 

“No. I’ve learned not to ask him 
questions. I used to -- but I never 
liked the answers.” 

“Why do you think he’s going 
out there?” 

I thought about it for a while. “I 
suppose he’s desperate.” Even as 
I said it I realized that it was 
true — and the idea surprised me. 
It was strange to think that 
Thomas Howard could ever be 
desperate. “I’ve told you what he’s 
aiming for with this business of 
the religion. As long as I’ve known 
him — and I suppose before that, 
too — he’s been mad for power. 
And I know he can control peo- 
ple- I’ve seen him do it. I think 
eventually he might succeed.” 

“But now the Bhak’zaa are 
standing smack in his way." 

I nodded. “Even if they were 
content just to take over Terra 
Nova, Howard would have to start 
all over again somewhere else. But 



really, it’s worse than that, isn’t it? 
They won’t stop here.” 

“Not bloody likely,” Jack said. 
“Not when that scouting party 
goes home and reports that they 
can take planets away from us like 
candy from a baby.” 

“And there go all the Prophet’s 
dreams of taking over the galaxy. 
He hasn’t got much to lose by 
going out there, has he?” 

“Except his mind.” 

“That’s what I'm wondering. I 
just can’t see him as a martyr. He’s 
too cold-blooded, too calculating. 
Do you suppose he really thinks he 
can drive them away?” 

“Hard to say. But then he’s 
never been short of self-con- 
fidence. He knows he has this 
power over human beings — I 
imagine he’s estimated the possi- 
bility of its working on aliens and 
decided it’s worth the risk. 
Anyway, men like Howard — mes- 
siahs, dictators — have never lacked 
for courage when something got in 
their way.” 

Remembering a thing Howard 
had once told me, I said, “He 
thinks this talent of his may be 
telepathic, extra-sensory — I’m 
not sure of the right term. Some 
sort of special gift. Perhaps if it 
works on other humans who 
haven’t got these mental 
powers — or don’t know how to use 
them — it may work on a race that 
does.” 

“Let’s hope he’s right. Person- 
ally I’m inclined to think he’s just

a very skilled mass hypnotist. But 
who knows, maybe he can 
hypnotize the Bhak’zaa.” 

The chanting had stopped. We 
went to the window. The Prophet 
raised his right arm in a gesture of 
benediction, climbed into a wait- 
ing aircar and was gone. 

1 went back to the board. Jock 
said, quite casually, “Where’s the 
aircar that belongs to the radio 
shack? Around the back?” 

I nodded, surprised. 

“Tank full?" 

“Yes — why?” 

“Because I think I’ll take a run 
out to that field. Hold the fort, 
Anna.” I twisted my head to stare 
at him. He was already on his feet 
and halfway out of the shack. 

“Jock, you’re not He had 
caught me totally off guard. I’ve 
always despised hysterical women, 
but I’m afraid I behaved like one 
then. “Jock, for God’s sake, come 
back here.” I realized suddenly I 
was shaking. 

He looked at me as though he 
had never really noticed me be- 
fore. “Don’t worry, Anna — I’ll be 
back. I was born cautious — it’s 
one of the reasons I’m still 
around. Mr. Howard can play the 
hero, if he likes. I’ll be the one 
skulking through the bushes.” 

He came back to the board, 
leaned over and kissed me. His 
hand rested for a moment on my 
cheek. “I’ll see you later, Anna.” 
And then, like the Prophet, he 
was gone. 



I WATCHED and waited through 
a half-hour that seemed like a 
half-century. There on my screen 
was the backdrop to the final act — 
the menacing bulk of the alien 
ship, the field partly hidden by a 
tangled mass of weeds and creepers, 
the shadowy fringe of trees that 
marked its edges. 

The first pale rays of the sun 
filtered through my windows. The 
curtain had risen but the stage re- 
mained empty. I sat, hands 
clenched on the sides of my chair, 
waiting for the play to begin. I 
wish I could say that I was con- 
scious of my unique posi- 
tion — sole spectator at a galatic 
denouement. It has a nice ring to 
it — but it belongs to a different 
kind of story. Human destiny did 
not concern me at that mo- 
ment — only Jock McLaren’s 
safety. 

An aircar landed on the far side 
of the field — the Prophet had ar- 
rived. He stood for a moment be- 
side the vehicle, his head thrown 
back to watch the rising sun. Then 
he walked with stately delibera- 
tion to the center of the stage. 

Of Jock there was no sign at all. 
I guessed that whatever his plans, 
he would be likely to leave the air- 
car somewhere well out of sight 
and approach the field on foot. 

I held my breath. A hatch had 
opened in the side of the ship. One 
at a time, the Bhak’zaa slithered 
out. 

Howard had his back to me. He 



106 



GALAXY 




stood perfectly still, his feet apart 
as though braced against a strong 
wind. His robe rippled out from his 
shoulders and caught the first sun- 
light in its silver threads. 

The Bhak’zaa, moving side by 
side, came within a few feet of him 
and stopped. I had a beautifully 
clear picture so clear that I could 
see the faint palpitation of the two 
vertical pupils in their eyes. I 
thought — though perhaps my 
imagination was at work that 
the distended vessels criss- 
crossing their bodies grew larger 
and more livid. 

Howard had turned a little and I 
could see his profile. His features 
were composed, his arms ex- 
tended, palms-up, in a gesture of 
friendship or appeasement that 
surely could mean nothing to the 
Bhak’zaa. The devices he had used 
to stir the senses of the crowd, to 
make their minds open and re- 
ceptive to him, were useless now. 
Had it all been a stage-trick? 1 
wondered. I knew the power of 
those strange eyes and that rich, 
compelling voice. But had I, like 
so many others, been swept away 
by the cry of the trumpet, the in- 
sistent rhythm of the drums, by 
the long-submerged emotions that 
boiled up and engulfed my reason? 

The Prophet knew how to reach 
the primitive, the irrational 
depths of human nature. But the 
Bhak’zaa were not human. Strip- 
ped of his stage paraphernalia and 
the force of his persuasive tongue. 



thrown up against the blank wall 
of a totally alien mind, what could 
he hope to acheive but martyrdom? 

Now he appeared to be speak- 
ing«“head thrown back, arms up- 
lifted— as he unleashed, into 
emptiness, all the power at his 
command. 

For what seemed like an im- 
possibly long time- though I sup- 
pose it was only minutes, or sec- 
onds- nothing happened. The 
actors stood frozen upon the stage, 
locked in silent, unseen combat. 
Whatever invisible forces met 
headlong in those few feet of space 
between them, for the moment at 
least an impasse had been reach- 
ed. 

I felt I could bear it no longer — I 
wanted it to be finished and 
done with. I waited for the hands 
to drop, the rigid spine to crumple, 
the cool eyes to go suddenly empty 
as the mind dissolved behind 
them. 

But still the Prophet spoke and 
the Bhak’zaa stood motionless 
and unresponding, like great 
slimy fungi risen out of the soil. 

1 thought I saw Howard begin 
to sway. And then Jock McLaren 
came up behind the aliens from 
somewhere in the woods and 
quietly caved in the backs of their 
skulls with a Fish club. 

I watched him drag the bodies 
over to the ship and stuff them one 
at a time through the opening. 
Then I looked at Howard. 1 didn’t 
need to see his face to know what 



108 



GALAXY 




had happened. For several min- 
utes he stood motionless and stared 
into the empty place where the 
Bhak’zaa had been. Then his knees 
buckled and he crumped slowly to 
the ground. 

Jock came back across the field, 
wiping his hands on his pocket 
handkerchief. He set the Prophet 
gently on his feet and half-led, half- 
dragged him away from the ship 
and into the shelter of the trees. 

Then the ship lifted way from (he 
ground on a sudden pillar of 
flame. I guessed that Jock had sent 
it home with a message from Per- 
igord, one 1 hoped the Bhak'zaa 
would understand. 

T HAT night we sat outside the 
inn and listened to the True 
Followers singing in the Temple. 
We couldn’t hear the words but 
the melody drifted down to 
us — threnodic, liturgical, inex- 
pressibly moving. Now and then 
it was drowned out entirely by a 
burst of laughter from the pub or 
by a sudden exuberant credenza 
on the Rigelian zyga. The rest of 
Perigord was celebrating a great 
victory; that their participation 
was indirect and their under- 
standing of the battle strategy 
nonexistent dampened their joy 
not one whit. But up on the hill 
they had not yet begun to rejoice. 
Tonight they paid tribute to the 
fallen leader, to the messiah who 
had sacrificed himself to save the 
human race. 



1 took Jock’s hand. “Everybody 
thinks the Prophet did it alone,” I 
said. “Are we going to leave it at 
that?” 

“Why not? He’s the one who’s 
sitting in the hospital with his 
mind blasted out, not me. God 
knows he’s earned any credit he 
gets.” And so I kept my private 
knowledge to myself for fifty 
years. 

They put the Prophet, what was 
left of him, in the General Hos- 
pital, along with the other victims 
of the Bhak’zaa — and after a while 
they built a special institution for 
them. Rather pointlessly, as it 
turned out, for none of them lived 
to see the edifice completed.

Howard was the last one to go; I’m 
told he clung tenaciously to exis- 
tence — of a kind — for half a year. 

After that the institution was 
converted into a hostel for the pil- 
grims who had begun to flow in 
ever-increasing numbers into 
Perigord. What was disastrous 
for the Prophet’s personal dreams 
of power was, ironically, a shot in 
the arm for the faith he had found- 
ed. The followers made sure that 
the story of mankind’s last-minute 
salvation, suitably dramatized 
and embellished, went out on the 
next Earth-bound ship. What part 
Pete Jackson may have played in 
this publicity drive I would not ven- 
ture to guess; except to say that he 
was a good businessman and a 
tireless civic booster and surely 
could not have overlooked the ad- 
vantages of owning a tavern in 
Mecca. 

At any rate, the big public net- 
works on Earth seized upon the 
story and the Temple at Perigord 
became the spiritual home of a 
galactic faith. Martyrdom, how- 
ever uncomfortable and incon- 
venient for the individual, is a 
splendid thing for a religion. 

And for commerce. 

I suppose that quite possibly in 
five years — or five hundred — the 
Bhak’zaa may return to our 
corner of the universe. But next 
time there may be no Prophet (and 
no Jock McLaren) to drive them 
away. But I prefer to think that 
Jock’s display of primitive vio- 



lence may have disconcerted their 
leaders enough to send them 
slithering off in some other direc- 
tion. There are, after all, plenty of 
stars in the sky. 

We’ve orbited a good many of 
those stars ourselves, Jock 
McLaren and I. About the time 
that the pilgrims started to ar- 
rive, Jock dug out his battered 
copy of Plimm's Guide to the In- 
habited Planets. 1 wasn’t sorry to 
move on. It was clear that Peri- 
gord would never be quite the same 
again. Already it was getting 
crowded. The sea was full of 
pleasure boats and the comfort- 
able clublike atmosphere had 
vanished from the inn now that 
there were so many unfamiliar 
faces. 

It was hard for me, harder than 
I ever thought it would be, to keep 
silent when I heard over and over 
again the details of how the Pro- 
phet went forth unarmed and van- 
quished the alien invaders. 

And then there was the statue, 
the one they commissioned to 
stand beside the Thomas Howard 
Monument. It was fifteen feet 
high and carved in the faithfully 
realistic avante-garde style they 
called the New Objectivism. 
Wherever I went in Perigord I 
seemed to pass it and always in 
spite of myself I looked up. And 
the Prophet’s granite eyes stared 
back at me, mocking me. On the 
stone lips was a small, cold smile of 
triumph. ★

WHEN

BURST 

R.A. LAFFERTY 



T HE Director of Publications for 
the Institute has stated that de- 
vices that succeed are more inter- 
esting then devices that fail. This 
one did succeed several times un- 
der conditions that are not prac- 
tical to duplicate and when it 
failed it really failed. But there is 
a chance that it may yet succeed 
under normal controlled condi 
tions and it will matter very much 
if it does. 

From the case book of the Insti- 
tute we give that early epi- 
sode — at the same time a qualified 
success and a grotesque fail- 




ure — of the sad death of Cecil 
Corn: 

PROJECT: Fence Around 

Us. 

PRINCIPLES: Cecil Corn 
and others of the Institute. 
PROBLEM: The Speed of 
Light (The Fence Around 
Us) as limitor to our hopes 
of far travel, unless a break- 
through is made, a new 
framework set up or a new 
aspect of matter discov- 
ered. 

PROCEDURE: As stated by 
Corn, if anything can be 
found that travels at a speed 
greater than light the fence 
is breached. An examina- 
tion of all transmission does 
not reveal anything that 
travels at a speed greater 
than light. However, it is 
discovered that we do not 
know the speed of one thing: 
Telepathy or thought trans- 
ference. Corn examined 
this. 

He found that telepathy 
travels at a variety of 
speeds, from olfactory 
(bluntly, the speed of smell, 
for pairs of telepaths whose 
body auras must be in con- 
tact for transmission) 
through speed of sound (for 
certain pairs who convey by 
pseudo-sound) to Earth-In- 
stantaneous speed (roughly 
radio-light speed). With the 



human element present, it 
was not possible to distin- 
quish Earth-instantaneous 
from a real instantaneous. 
Earth did not provide a long 
enough base line. 

Corn — himself an ade- 
quate telepath — set up a 
number of moon contacts. 
He convinced himself that 
telepathy might be truly in- 
stantaneous, but he failed to 
convince others. The hu- 
man element still ate up 
what should have been a sec- 
ond and a half time lag be- 
tween instantaneous telep- 
athy and radio transmis- 
sion. 

Corn set up contact with a 
young Chinese named Fran- 
cis Pung who was on Mars 
mission. The two were in 
good rapport. The time lag 
on test night should have 
been four and a half min- 
utes. If telepathy were tru- 
ly instantaneous its mes- 
sage should have been re- 
ceived and recorded com- 
pletely before the syn- 
chronous radio message ar- 
rived at Earth. The experi- 
ment was well witnessed. 

Corn sat at the symbol 
machine and began to re- 
ceive and record. Corn knew 
these first symbols in ad- 
vance, but not others. Then 
his Mars contact went to 
impassioned voice and Corn 



112 



GALAXY 




recorded the message in al- 
most hysterical words: 
Corn, believe me that I 
transmit by mind and at this 
time. Whatever you will 
hear about me shortly will 
not change it. The symbols 
now become impossible to 
me. 

Corn recorded the words 
and sat back bewildered. A 
four-minute silence ensued 
and then the radio message 
began. It gave the first sym- 
bols as Corn had recorded 
them. Then it gave further 
symbols which were not 
known in advance and which 
Corn had not set down. Then 
it gave the news that Francis 
Pung had dropped dead in the 
Mars radio booth just after 
the beginning of the experi- 
ment. 

Corn could not have 
known that Pung would die. 
He had received a message 
of sorts four minutes before 
the radio message. But the 
episode became and is still 
known as the Great Corn 
Hoax. 

Aloysius Shiplap and oth- 
ers of us persuaded Corn to 
go on experimenting. 

“This next one has to be 
it,” Corn said, “Another 
failure would kill me.” 

Corn set up another 
Mars contact with Sid Sider- 
al, a man in such perfect 



health that he was a marvel. 

Concurrently with this fi- 
nal test of Corn’s our Valery 
Mok set up an experiment 
of her own. She was in rap- 
port with her friend Corn. As 
the test went on she set down 
what went through the mind 
of Corn as he received the 
message of Sideral, and as 
he believed he was record- 
ing it. 

Valery’s notes — which 
were not time-stamped — are 
these: 

“Perfect, Sid, nothing will 
go wrong this time. Why is 
Aloysius fiddling with my 
head and mumbling? Re- 
ceiving and recording nice- 
ly, Sid, if only they would let 
me alone. Why are the idiots 
taking off my necktie and 
pouring water over me? 
Why are they coming at me 
with a needle? I’ve had all 
my shots. Sid, I’ve beat the 
jinx. You’re a partner too 
healthy to die on me. Ah, ah, 
Sid — the jinx had one trick 
left. I lose again. I died on 
you.” 

He did. Cecil Corn died at 
the beginning of the experi- 
ment and he had recorded 
nothing. What Valery Mok 
recorded was not clocked. 
But she made affidavit that 
Corn had been receiving 
from Sideral exactly the 
same data that came by ra- 



BUBBLES WHEN THEY BURST 



113 




dio four minutes later that 
she had heard it as an under- 
current to the thoughts of 
Corn with whom she was in 
rapport. 

The press does not usual- 
ly call a lady a shameless 
liar, but in this case it did. 
The incident is still known 
as the Great Mok Mockery. 
FURTHER PROCEDURE: 
Those of us who would like to 
believe have had our faith 
shaken. We have made a 
dozen further tests of si- 
multaneous distant radio 
and telepathic transmis- 
sion. In every case we have 
found that telepathic trans- 
mission over great distance 
is at radio-light speed and not 
beyond it. We cannot be- 
lieve that the two incidents 
were conscious frauds, but 
they may have been uncon- 
scious ones. 

CONCLUSION: Draw your 
own. 

DISPOSAL OF CASE: 
Open, and subject to re- 
view. 

EXPECTATIONS: Mea- 
ger. 

AND that is the way it remained 
**in the Case Book. But the case 
did remain in the open file and 
Gregory Smirnov of the Institute 
pulled it out once a year to review 
it. He did so now with a quorum 
present. 



“It always makes me sad to see 
that folder on Cecil,” said Valery. 
“He was such a sweet man. You re- 
member the funny way he had of 
scattering cigar ashes over ev- 
erything? And his little trick of 
falling asleep in the middle of a 
sentence? Well, you’ve done your 
duty, Gregory. Put it away for an- 
other year.” 

“No. I’m thinking of reopen- 
ing the experiment,” said Greg- 
ory. 

“ Y ou’re crazy,” Glasser said. 

“Not crazy. A little odd, per- 
haps. I wouldn’t be director of the 
Institute if I weren’t. The prob- 
lem remains. A breakthrough 
must be made, a new framework 
set up or a new aspect of matter 
has to be discovered. If matter is 
only what we have believed it to 
be we are limited forever. But 
there is a missing factor. All we 
need is a proper sort of relay to 
make the idea work.” 

“And do you know where to find 
such a relay?” Aloysius asked. 

“I believe it could be found in a 
hundred impractical places ev- 
ery minute,” Gregory said. “First 
we must somehow catch that re- 
lay on the fly and prove that it does 
work. Then we will have to synthe- 
size it and have it always ready. It 
will not solve our problem. It will 
only enable us to state our prob- 
lem seriously and go to work on 
it. We will prove that there is one 
special case of instantaneous 
speed — beyond radio-light speed. 



114 



GALAXY 




Then we will seek means to bring 
other things to that speed. We will 
have broken out of our frame- 
work and set the problem in its 
proper context.” 

“You speak as though the relay 
already existed,” said Valery. 

“Why, it does,” Gregory said. 
“That is, it exists sometimes. 
That is, I think it does.” 

“If it exists, then use it,” said 
Glasser. “Make the test.” 

“I intend to if I can. But the re- 
lay is tricky and hard to come by. 
Epiktistes, who has analyzed a 
million or so cases of its opera- 
tion, believes that it has an effec- 
tive life of between five and thirty 
seconds — no more.” 

“Well, Gregory, you will have to 
acquire a number of the relays to 
experiment effectively,” Aloy- 
sius said, “or you will have to find 
ways of extending their life. The 
relays — are they expensive?” 

“Not as you mean it, Aloysius.” 
“Does it take long to construct 
one?” 

“About ninety years on an aver- 
age.” 

(On the same day that Gregory 
Smirnov reopened the Cecil 
Corn Case, the Nine Conspira- 
tors of Nebula Proxima were sen- 
tenced to death by a Court on Ken- 
tauron Mikron. We thought you 
might not have heard of it.) 

Gregory Smirnov nibbled at 
mountains of data for days. He 



seemed to make a dozen false 
starts. All institute people were 
clammy when they were onto 
something that wasn’t yet ripe. 
They would never give an honest 
man a hint of what they were onto. 
But somebody had to bring Smir- 
nov out of his trance. 

“Just what are you working on, 
Gregory?” asked Glasser after a 
routine meeting of the Institute 
people. “Or rather — since it’s ap- 
parent that you’re not doing any 
work at all — what are you think- 
ing about?” 

“About electric eels when they 
die,” said Gregory. 

“Oh? I didn’t know you were in- 
terested in them? And what else?” 

“Gegenschein, condensers, bird 
entrails, missing factors, oracular 
pythons, thanatakolouthia (death- 
trains or death-echoes), backlash, 
young wives’ tales, shackling 
emancipation from frameworks, 
hysteresis, collapsing fields, bub- 
bles when they burst.” 

“Oh, come now!” protested 
Valery. 

“Atoms or systems into ruin 
hurl’d, 

And now a bubble burst, and 
now a world,” issued the machine 
Epiktistes. 

“What? What?” demanded 
Glasser. “Who is making less 
sense, the man or the machine?” 

“It’s from A. Pope,” issued 
Epiktistes. “I thought it was per- 
tinent.” 

“One riddle at a time,” said 



BUBBLES WHENTHEY BURST 



115 




Charles Cogsworth, the humble 
husband of Valery. “What of the 
shackling emancipation from 
frameworks, Gregory?” 

“One framework actually — that 
in which we live. The Baconian 
and Comptean Revolutions freed 
us from the old frameworks cen- 
turies before we were born. But 
they prisoned us in a tighter 
one — that of doctrinaire ma- 
terialism. Now we are forbidden 
to have superstitions at all, so a 
most interesting field is closed to 
us. We cannot get out of our pres- 
ent frame, we cannot even come 
near its borders — but there are 
some answers to be found in those 
borderlands.” 

“To those of us who like bird en- 
trails — and there are less than two 
of us in the world — your interest 
is welcome,” said Aloysius. “But 
what is your interest, Gregory?” 

“The emphasis on speed,” said 
Gregory Smirnov. “In reading 
fortunes from bird entrails, great 
speed was necessary. The living 
bird was ripped open and studied. 
Whatever happened, it hap- 
pened fast.” 

“There’s another one,” issued 
the machine Epiktistes: “ ‘All at 
once, and nothing first. Just as 
bubbles do when they burst.’ From 
O.W. Holmes. That’s the way the 
One-Hoss Shay broke down.” 

“What about condensers, 
backlash, collapsing fields?” 
asked Cogsworth. 

“Oh, we explain them with 



equations, but we don’t really ex- 
plain. Why should the old electro- 
magnetic animal kick hardest 
just after it has died? Why is the 
echo stronger than the voice?” 
“And young wives’ tales?” asked 
Valery. “I’ve been a young wife 
for more years than seems possi- 
ble.” 

“You came close to it in the 
Great Mok Mockery,” said Greg- 
ory. “An old wife would be too 
sane to conceive of such an ap- 
proach.” 

“What does happen when elec- 
tric eels die?” demanded Glasser. 
“What does happen to bubbles 
when they burst?” 

“I don’t know,” said Gregory, 
“but either of them would serve as 
a relay — for too short an inter- 
val. A relay, but not a good 
enough relay. I need something 
more intricate than an eel and 
more tenuous than a bubble. And 
I need it exactly when it van- 
ishes.” 

T HAT was all the Institute peo- 
ple could get from Gregory 
Smirnov that day. They tried to 
find from Epiktistes, the machine 
resident at the Institute, what 
sort of relay it was of which he had 
analyzed millions of cases. 

“I’m almost as much in the dark 
as you,” Epiktistes issued. “I’ve 
analyzed millions of cases of mil- 
lions of things for that man. What 
he calls a relay I may be calling 
something else.”

“But what is it that has an effec- 
tive life of between five and thirty 
seconds and no more?” insisted 
Charles Cogsworth. 

“The pledge of a stranger, the 
allegiance of a Martian, the in- 
terest of a dilettante, the love of a 
gray-eyed woman,” issued Epik- 
tistes. 

“Epikt, you can be as exasper- 
ating as a man,” said Valery. 

But Gregory was going ahead 
with something. He announced to 
them that he had set up a new test 
which would have to be the con- 
clusive test. 

“Then you have found a good 
way of obtaining your relays?” 
Aloysius asked. 

“No. 1 have not found out any- 
thing new,” Gregory said. “But I 
have accidentally acquired the 
use of a bunch of the relays. I be- 
lieve that they will serve for the test 
and the proof. Then I will begin 
my long hard search to synthesize 
the things and to apply the things 
to more solid matter — or to prove 
that matter is less solid than it 
seems.” 

“Are you still bothered by our 
framework?” Cogsworth asked. 

“Yes. We are so superstitious 
that we cower in the middle of 
our frame. If we are so sure, what 
are we afraid of? We have insisted 
that life is no more than chemical- 
electro-magnetic phenomena, but 
we are afraid to consider that life 
may have such backlash as all oth- 
er similar phenomena show. 1 won- 



der how they will play it down 
when I finally prove it all.” 

It was a major experiment and 
it involved nine radio receivers, 
nine conventional telepathic re- 
ceivers, nine special telepathic 
receivers. It began. 

The nine special telepaths re- 
ceived and recorded nine separ- 
ate symbols. This was impor- 
tant. These symbols were not 
known by anyone on Earth. They 
were known by only one person 
on the originating asteroid up to 
the moment they were given for 
transmission. They would not be 
verified until they were received 
by radio. 

Then the nine special telepaths 
received and recorded in 
words — short messages and still 
shorter — total transmissions 
from five to thirty seconds, no 
more. Then silence and the wait 
for the messages by radio and nor- 
mal telepathy to begin. 

“Who were they?” asked Aloy- 
sius who had the gift of always 
being in the dark as to details of a 
project. 

“Oh, the nine conspirators of 
Nebula Proxima,” said Gregory. 
“They have just been executed on 
the asteroid where the conspir- 
acy was planned.” 

“And they are transmitting af- 
ter they are dead?” 

“Certainly not, Aloysius. We 
could not believe that and still live 
in our narrow framework. The in- 
stant of the collapsing field is still 



BUBBLES WHENTHEY BURST 



117 




a part of the life of the field. The 
bursting of the bubble must still 
be accounted a phenomenon of 
the bubble. They serve — just after 
their apparent deaths — as the in- 
stantaneous relay.” 

“This was the missing factor?” 
“Yes. It was the factor of the in- 
stantaneous transmission when 
Francis Pung died on Mars. It was 
the factor when Cecil Corn died 
on Earth. The death-instantane- 
ous relay works in both direc- 
tions.” 

“And you believe that you can 
synthesize such a relay?” 

“I am too old to break out of the 
frame, Aloysius. My chilly faith 
constrains me to believe that ev- 
erything is material. And any- 
thing that is material can be re- 
produced in matter.” 

“And what if the frame is all a 
mistake?” 

“In either case, the problem 
can now be tackled.” 

“It was of this that Epiktistes 
analyzed a million cases?” 

“Yes. The more clearly verified 
cases of death-simultaneous ap- 
paritions and messages.” 

“How were the nine criminals 
induced to cooperate?” 

“What had they to lose? They 
were all reasonable men, save on 
politics.” 

The slow minutes had trickled 
away. The radio transmission 
began to come through. At the 
same time arrived the messages 
from trained telepath to trained 



telepath — all coming at radio- 
light speed and each received and 
recorded by an operator in his 
own cubicle. 

The symbols were those nine al- 
ready received. This itself was 
verification. The brief com- 
ments of the criminals were also 
verification. They were flashes of 
wit and irony sparked by details of 
their own executions that could 
not have been known before. 

O INSTANTANEOUS trans- 
mission in a special case was 
proved. And once proved, it opened 
the gates? And many men bent 
their genius to the follow-up, the 
synthesizing of a comparable 
relay? 

Well, no — it didn’t happen like 
that. Gregory Smirnov and Aloy- 
sius Shiplap and Valery Mok and 
a few are working on the follow- 
up and they are getting some good 
leads. But the thing was not ac- 
cepted by the Credentials Soci- 
ety, though they had their own im- 
partial men observing and tak- 
ing part in the experiment. Three 
men of the Credentials Society 
had even served as receivers for 
three of the criminals. 

The results were rejected by 
Credentials because “the ver- 
acity of the Testimony of con- 
victed Criminals may not be ac- 
cepted as Evidence in any Prime 
Matter under Dispute.” 

It is still called the Great Greg- 
ory Gallimaufry. ★

W E’VE spoken of this before. 

While the writing of fiction is 
usually a cerebral process, the 
reading of it is not. While a num- 
ber of readers have the capacity 
and sometimes the inclination to 
appreciate the well-turned phrase, 
few have the patience to take de- 
light in a series of them over sixty 
thousand consecutive words. Many 
people quote from Shakespeare. 
Fewer have read him except under 
compulsion. 

The most popular writers are 
semiliterate. Quib me no quib- 
bles — certainly there are literate 
works of fiction that have enjoyed 
audiences of millions — over the 
tens and hundreds of years. The 
overnight success of the masses, 
however, is invariably written as 
though the author regarded the 
language as an impediment. And 
that is precisely so. Language, in 
any form, interferes between the 
reader and the writer’s concept. 

It remains for the mass-success- 
ful author only to restrict himself 



to concepts that have already 
been half-communicated for him 
by the ambient popular mood. 
After that the purpose of his lan- 
guage is to deliver the recogni- 
tion signal and get out of the 
way — to travel no graceful paths, 
to cling to every rut of popular 
grammar, to be completely un- 
obtrusive — except, perhaps, to a 
teacher or a critic. 

Thus James Bond, Tarzan and 
the Valentine Smith of Stranger in 
a Strange Land’s back half. Thus 
Leon Uris, Arthur Hailey, Harold 
Robbins and A.E. van Vogt. 

But this is an old assertion 
here. Now toward a new point: 

Hardly anyone is so miserable 
as to write badly on purpose. In 
his mind any writer chosen at ran- 
dom will have an image of what 
constitutes good writing. And 
though he will from time to time 
deliberately depart from it in 
his actions for one pressing rea- 
son or another, as long as he holds 
the image and feels he can dupli- 



119 




cate it in his actions, he still con- 
siders himself a good writer. The 
reams of flawed or uninspired 
copy in his closet do not have, for 
him, the weight of the three or four 
results from the times when he was 
acting in accordance with the 
image. Though he has authored 
Blood on My Jets a thousand 
times, he is redeemed for himself 
by one time when the muse whis- 
pered to him while he wasn’t busy 
with something else. And that’s 
how it should be — for his sake. But 
suppose he wrote Blood on My 
Jets rather well? When he goes to 
his grave with his one manuscript 
and consigns the piles of lead 
novelettes for Stupendous Science 
Monthly to the dungheap, what is 
he heaping on what may be a vast 
congregation of fans? 

Does a writer see two audi- 
ences? A good audience for his 
work in accordance with his 
image of good writing and then, 
for the other stuff, an ignomin- 
ious one? Does- he perhaps see one 
audience without the power to 
differentiate? 

These are terrible traps to set for 
one’s own soul. 

But they need concern only him, 
not us. For the reader need make 
no discriminations. Either a 
story takes hold of him or it 
doesn’t. If he has an analytical 
bent and would like to ponder why 
he was swept up — when the story’s 
finished and readership has 
ended — that, too, is undoubtedly 



a pleasure to some, but it has 
nothing to do with being a reader. 
It has to do with being possessed 
of an educated, intelligent 
brain — like that of most writers. 
That is when reader and writer 
come closest together as human 
beings on the common ground of 
rationality. Reading is an ex- 
perience of the spinal column, 
which knows only pleasure or pain 
and cares nothing for the writer. 

W RITERS rarely meet read- 
ers. They meet a fair number 
of people who have had the ex- 
perience of reading and are willing 
to discuss it. A reader is in a con- 
dition of autohypnosis and has nar- 
row interests. The circle of a 
writer’s acquaintances, on the 
other hand, is bound to be as witty 
and articulate as he was while he 
was constructing a hypnotism. 
And here is a trap for all of us. Be- 
cause it seems possible that a 
writer might mistake his acquain- 
tances for readers and the appre- 
ciation of his intelligence for the 
same thing that makes readers seek 
out his work. 

A writer of fiction is by defini- 
tion incapable of reading it. He 
does something else; he decodes 
the words on the paper, examines 
the structure of narrative which 
results from their arrangment 
and transposes this into an appre- 
ciation, much like Patton visiting 
Waterloo. Prosaists dig poetry, 
however — and movies; better yet, 



120 



GALAXY 




music or photography. Writers 
have forgotten what it’s like to 
pick up a book and just let the 
story envelop them. There is no 
being carried fully away, as there 
is in the concert hall or the Odeon. 
It’s a recognized price one pays, 
but perhaps its full extent is not 
appreciated by all those who pay 
it. For except for the rich, unin- 
hibited few who fantasize direct- 
ly onto paper as Ian Fleming and 
Fdgar Rice Burroughs did, writers 
as they go along tend more and 
more to feel that good writing is 
writing on which a high degree of 
rationality has been expended — 
most often, visibly expended — and 
that any writing they do that has 
not received this benefit is the less, 
in direct proportion. 

And there are of course other oc- 
cupational specialties staffed by 
people who take the same view. 
These are editors, critics and ca- 
reer intellectuals. (We exclude 
publishers; publishers as a class 
converse either in figures or in 
news releases). 

So there are few editorial work- 
ers who do not feel guilty about 
their coarser associations. I met 
the man who wrote the blurbs for 
NAL’s edition of/, THE JURY. 

I le was a broken man, but was re- 
covering slowly in his Greenwich 
Village music store. 

More to the point, there are few 
people a writer meets who by their 
nature and inclination do not re- 
inforce the belief that only pains- 



taking work is good work — that 
is, work worthy of consideration. 
What few people seem to propose 
is that while there is a difference 
between good and bad compo- 
sition, there is no one-to-one re- 
lationship between this and good 
or bad communication. 

In all my years I have never met 
a raped mind that was restored to 
innocence by a book. I have seen 
people energized by stories, but 
they are not necessarily driven in 
any consistent direction. I also 
have a little list of stories I con- 
sider better than other stories and 
I can give you reasons. But I can’t 
always give them in a manner co- 
herent to you, because sometimes 
I find that the enjoyable things in 
a story will not yield to descrip- 
tion in analytical terms, just as I 
find that a book that analyzes 200 
proof can sometimes be rather 
dull. In fact, downright dis- 
couraging. One is led to the con- 
clusion that the analytical ap- 
proach is not consistently effec- 
tive, and that to attempt to sub- 
stitute something para-logical, 
as Damon Knight does with his 
symbolic evaluations, is to plunge 
into a morass. Such a morass as 
one would be a fool to be defend- 
ing throughout the remainder of 
one’s professional lifetime, as I 
would have to do were I to con- 
struct one of my own. Then again, 
I’m not as smart as Damon, or as 
any top-flight critic. 

But 1 wander from my point (a

sure sign of advancing senility). 
In fact, I have two points (a sure 
sign of evil). 

P OINT One: Perhaps there are a 
number of skilled people de- 
monstrably intelligent, personally 
charming, professionally knowl- 
edgeable and critically acclaimed 
who are writing good books and 
giving pleasure to fewer and fewer 
readers. Question A, under that 
heading: Are we selecting those 
writers who are by nature better 
equipped to entertain and leaving 
entertainment to despised medio- 
crities who may — here we come 
doubling back on our tracks — in 
fact not be as mediocre as all that? 

B, under the same heading: Is 
there a Mission to improve the 
nature and condition of the world 
by telling Important stories — and 
if so, will you show me the Im- 
prover who is not doing it by cut- 
ting down his readership to an 
elite? An in-effect elite of semi- 
professionals? 

C, if there is no Mission, why 
aren’t we teaching From Russia 
With Love in English Lit courses? 
Was it not a signal event in the his- 
tory of that field? Didn’t it speak 
for the Cold War in exactly the 
same way A Tale of Two Cities 
spoke for the French Revolution? 
Isn’t it qualified on a dozen other 
counts? True, most of the younger 
generation never heard of it, but 
how many of them do you suppose 
would have heard of Dickens if the 



establishment weren’t keeping 
him alive? 

Oh, I’m oversimplifying, all 
right. But I would like to see some- 
body keep nudging at this; not be- 
cause it will change or improve 
anything, but because it will drag 
us one step closer to cutting down 
the confused to a numerically 
smaller — but unfortunately no 
less potent— elite, as always hap- 
pens. 

(As usual, I did my homework. I 
had some books to review. I com- 
mend to you James Blish’s AND 
ALL THE STARS A STAGE 
— Doubleday, $4.95 — because it 
is an entertaining book, which I 
suspect Jim thinks is minor. The 
rest I commend to whatever fate 
awaits the lazy, the pretentious, 
the greedy — in short, the con- 
fused. As usual when I produce a 
long essay intended to cut rather 
close to the bone, I chose not to 
write the reviews, for fear some- 
one might think I was going from 
the general to the particular). 

Finally, I’d like to apologize to 
all the people whose letters I 
never answered. I didn’t feel I was 
in a position to get into either a 
good or bad relationship based on 
this column. 

And with that, we close. Point 
Two is that your faithful reviewer 
has no further grounds for believ- 
ing himself even marginally com- 
petent. It has been about Five 
years, I thank you for your kind 
attention and I am hanging it up. ★

JOHN W. CAMPBELL 
June 8, 1910-July 11, 1971 

Science fiction lost one of its brightest stars when John W. 
Campbell passed on at the age of 61. A pioneering writer in 
the genre under his own name and the pseudonym Don A. 
Stuart, he became editor of Astounding (later Analog) in 
1937. Continuing in that post until his death, he made mon- 
umental contributions to the field. He published the first stor- 
ies of many science-fictioneers who today are famous. Per- 
haps more than any man, he helped forge what is often 
called the “Golden Age of Science Fiction." 

Over the years, he tirelessly continued to define, shape and 
give direction to science fiction by deeds and words. The lat- 
ter, often controversial, were always thought-provoking. 
Here are some memorable examples: 



Science fiction comes when 
science takes some of the ten- 
sion of terror out of the future 
tense. (Astounding, June, 



No literature is sound, no 
philosophy of action work- 
able, if it doesn't take a hard 
look at itself and consider 
whether the Eternal Fitness of 
Things isn't getting a little 
tight across the shoulders. (In- 
troduction, 2nd edition. Cloak 
of Aesir, 1952) 

Mainstream literature is, in 
fact, a narrow subdivision of 
the field of science fiction . 
Science fiction includes the to- 



tal scope from the remote past 
to the far future — and any- 
where in the universe . 
Mainstream literature is ... a 
small local eddy in the whole 
stream of history, which is the 
proper field of science fiction. 
(From a speech made to East- 
ern Science Fiction Association, 
1963) 



Good science fiction is rele- 
vant — more relevant than any 
other kind of fiction. But it isn't 
properly relevant to what 
you're thinking now; it's rele- 
vant to what you had better 
be thinking next year and the 
rest of your life. (From a pri- 
vate letter, 1970) 



CHILDREN 

conclusion 



WHA THASGONE BEFORE 

The Moon Children were born to 
the wives of three lunar explorers who 
had become mysteriously contamin- 
ated during an unscheduled moon 
landing in response to a light phe- 
nomenon. 

NICK and KYRIE were born days 
apart, mentally precocious and aware 
of each other before they met — and 
of GUY before he was born some 
months later. Earth had had experi- 
ence of the dangers of contact with 
alien biocosms — particularly those 
of Jupiter and Mercury and the 
children were hated and feared. KY- 
RIE and GUY were rejected even by 
their parents and all three were 
brought up under laboratory condi- 
tions under the aegis of COSMOS, 
an official body. Their immediate su- 
pervision was in the hands of Nick's 
parents, YURI MARKO and Dr. 
CAROLINA CARTER. 

By the age of seven NICK and 



KYRIE were matching wits with 
Earth’s top scientists. NICK solved 
the mystery of the propulsion system 
used by Jovian delta-life — and traded 
his knowledge for some of the moon 
grit that had contaminated his father. 
The grit held an instant message for 
the children. It told them they were 
not children at all — and not human. 

From the moon grit, fashioned by 
GUY into a mysteriously energized 
tetrahedron, NICK and K YRIE learn 
their real mission. They are to build 
a gigantic tachyon tower to guide in 
the FTL ships of an advanced inter- 
stellar culture capable of solving 
Earth's growing problems with alien 
biocosms. Construction of the tower, 
however, would tax Earth’s global re- 
sources. So world governments vote 
instead to dismantle COSMOS and 
cope individually with the problems 
of the invading biocosms. 

Skygate, formerly site of COS- 
MOS, becomes a U.S. military in- 
stallation. NICK and KYRIE con- 
tinue their study of the tetrahedron, 
but their problems are compounded 
by the fact that GUY, growing in- 
creasingly animal-like, becomes jeal- 
ous of them. The new world situation 
also forces the return of GUY'S fa- 
ther, TOM HODIAN, from self-im- 
posed exile. GUY becomes pathetical- 
ly attached to his father and further 
estranged from KYRIE and NICK. 

With Earth now virtually in a state 
of siege by the alien biocosms, a new 
menace appears. Metal ants, ener- 
gy-consuming and impervious to at- 
tack, overrun Skygate. Suspected of 
collaboration with the alien menace, 
KIM HODIAN , the chronicler of 
these events, is being flown into cus- 
tody when his plane is downed in an 



125 




apparent attack by Jovian delta-life. 

He comes to in a hospital. While he 
recovers, Earth is slowly losing the 
battle of the biocosms. But he hears 
rumors leading him to believe that 
GUY has excaped Sky gate with the 
priceless tetrahedron — and is being 
worshiped as a sex-symbol by women. 

M Y NEXT companion was Dr. 

Narasimachar. The gamma- 
forms were eating his nerve tissue 
now. Most of the time he was twist- 
ing and moaning in an agony the 
nurses couldn’t relieve, or howling 
in delirium, but sometimes he 
was sane and calm enough to talk. 

“You know, Hodian, I hate to 
go now,” he told me during one 
long midnight interlude. “Just be- 
fore the world ends. I’d rather be 
the last man. Anyhow, I’d like to 
live long enough to see where we 
went wrong.” 

Drowsily, I pondered that. 

“I was a research man,” he said. 
“I never cared much for individual 
people — you learned not to in the 
Indian cities where I grew up. But I 
did have rather large ideals. That’s 
why I tackled the space diseases. 
We had to conquer them, I 
thought, before we could hope to 
make friends with our neighbor 
biocosms. Now I guess we’ll nev- 
er win.” 

He sighed and fell silent. I lay 
contemplating Spike Ballou and 
his tale of Guy’s kingdom of wom- 
en, who were somehow protected 
by the moon jewel from both space 



creatures and space diseases. The 
whole story seemed too complex 
and improbable to bear retelling 
to a dying man, so 1 said nothing. 

“I’ve always been an optimist,” 
Narasimachar went on suddenly. 
“I believed in science. I hoped it 
would show us our world and our 
nature. I tried to make it a bridge 
that we could follow, from the an- 
imals we are to the gods we could 
be.” 

I heard him move and felt his 
tormented eyes on me in the dark. 

“Hodian, do you think I was 
wrong?” 

I had to say I didn’t know. 

By morning he was frothing and 
whimpering again. Two days later 
he died. Andy Elving came in to 
pull the sheets over his face and 
draw the screen around his bed, but 
nobody took him away. Some- 
times I heard feet and thumps and 
whispers in the corridor, but no- 
body answered my buzzer. 

The screen blocked my view of 
the window, but for a time I could 
hear sounds in the street. The drum 
of fast traffic. An angry blare of 
horns. Now and again, squealing 
tires and the crash of a collision. 
These noises ebbed and finally 
ceased. 

By afternoon the silence was stif- 
ling. I strained to hear the clink of 
a dish, the echo of a footstep, a 
voice on the street, for any sound at 
all. All I could hear, with my head 
on the pillow, was the slow throb 
of my own blood. 



126 



GALAXY 




Before nightfall, Narasimachar 
had begun to smell. Not, however, 
with any odor of human decay, but 
with the sour and overpowering 
scent of the gamma-life which had 
consumed him, a scent like a 
mashed beetle. 

Goaded by that odor, by hot 
thirst and cold terror, 1 struggled 
out of bed that night. Giddy with 
weakness, clutching at chairs and 
the wall, I swayed around that 
blocking screen and reached the 
window. 

Outside, a full moon shone on a 
sea of snowy fog. It lay flat across 
the river valley and covered most of 
the town. Here, on the low hill 
where the hospital stood, the tops 
of trees and the roofs of a few 
drowned houses stood dark above 
it. Covering the first floor of the 
hospital, the fog came nearly to 
my window ledge. 

Far away across it, faint lights 
twinkled on the black hills where I 
suppose the refugees were camped. 
Though no wind stirred the trees, 
that vast white lake was alive with 
lazy waves whose slow rise and fall 
became almost hypnotic. Cold 
as the moon, serenely soundless, 
it shone with an unearthly loveli- 
ness that almost invited me to 
jump. 

FATALITY 

XVIII 

A NDY ELVING woke me next 
morning out of a long night- 



mare in which a sweet high voice 
like the baby Kyrie’s kept enticing 
me to dive into that snowy fog. I 
found myself where I must have 
fallen inside the window. Along 
with all the familiar discomforts 
of my gamma-form infection, I 
was bruised and chilled, too numb 
to move. 

Elving wore a mask against the 
overwhelming beetle reek of Dr. 
Narasimachar’s corpse. Pale and 
grim beneath it, he made no ef- 
fort to speak, but moved with 
methodic calm, hauling me into a 
wheelchair and pushing me down 
the empty corridors and ramps 
out to the hospital parking lot. It 
was deserted except for an aban- 
doned funeral coach that must 
have come for the dead doctor. 

My stiffened limbs jerked with 
shock when I met the fog. Its odor 
struck me first — a heavy rancid 
scent that made me think of over- 
ripe muskmelons rotting in a gar- 
bage can. Then I saw it through a 
screen of trees — a gray uneven sea 
that heaved and billowed as if 
agitated by more wind than I could 
feel. 

Its surface layers, darkened to a 
leaden color, were shredded into 
tattered, crawling wisps, as if 
somehow dissolved by sunlight. 
Its level had sunk perhaps a dozen 
yards, leaving the hospital on a 
low island rimmed with a red, 
slick-looking residue where its 
deeper layers had lain. 

Beneath those writhing tongues

its depths were still milk-white, 
opaque as ever. Lapping over the 
roofs below the row of trees, the 
dull flood filled the valley and still 
covered most of the city. A for- 
lorn little group of buildings in 
the business district rose out of it, 
the tallest topped with a sign 
somehow still flashing: PIT- 
MAN TRUST. 

“A bad night, Mr. Kim.” Elv- 
ing had torn off his white mask 
when we came into the open. 
“Sorry I couldn’t get you out yes- 
terday, but I was trying to save a 
few of my roses.” He was loading 
me out of the wheelchair into the 
long black hearse and 1 saw a stack 
of his rose bushes already there, 
neatly bagged in burlap. “The 
militia had warned us, but the fog 
came in faster than anybody 
thought. I spent the night on the 
hospital roof.” 

I felt a pang of dismay when 1 
learned that the motor keys were 
missing, but Andy Elving had 
been an astro-engineer. He lifted 
the hood and started the motor 
with a pair of pliers. I watched with 
a little more hope as he got under 
the wheel and drove us off the 
parking lot. 

The fog surrounded us. He tried 
one street and then another, turn- 
ing back when the pavement dip- 
ped below that restless sea. 
Everything was covered on three 
sides of us. Southward, however, 
the ground was higher. At last we 
found one residential street where 



dripping trees and soiled roofs 
marked out a hazardous lane 
through the fogginess. 

Elving stopped the hearse above 
that street to study the crawling 
tongues of mist that still intermit- 
tently hid the red-slimed pave- 
ment. Stolidly calm, he pulled a 
plug of tobacco out of his hip 
pocket and bit off the end of it. 

“A filthy habit,” he muttered 
absently. “Picked it up on the 
moon. We couldn’t smoke in the 
spacecraft.” 

He sat there some thirty min- 
utes, chewing steadily, spitting 
unobtrusively, watching those 
tossing rags of fog. At last he ex- 
pelled his wad into the street, 
closed the window, gripped the 
wheel. 

“Hang on, Mr. Kim,” he called 
to me. “The stuff has gone down as 
far as it’s going to. I guess it’s now 
or never for us.” 

Too weak to hang on, I dropped 
flat. The trucklike hearse lurched 
down the street. Gray tongues 
licked at the windows. Suddenly 
everything was white. Elving sat 
hunched and rigid, driving blind. 

We hit something. The hearse 
lurched and quivered with the im- 
pact. Above the whine of the rac- 
ing motor I thought 1 heard an- 
other sound — a thin fading wail, 
like the cry of some small creature 
in pain. 

Perhaps the echo simply lurked 
in my excited imagination, for the 
hearse was skidding, the tires 



128

screeching on the unseen pave- 
ment with a far louder scream. Elv- 
ing grunted and struggled at the 
wheel. We jolted against the hid- 
den curb, and that rancid musk- 
melon odor was suddenly nauseat- 
ing. But the hearse roared on till 1 
saw blue sky. 

Elving stopped a mile up the 
street. He rolled down the win- 
dow, mopped his calm brown face 
and bit off more tobacco. 

“Well, Mr. Kim." He looked 
around at me almost casually. 
“What now?" 

“I think I know a place where 
the fog and the ants won’t come. A 
place where nobody gets the space 
diseases.” 

I told him briefly about Spike 
Ballou and the Moon King. 

“I’ve heard that yarn.’’ He 
frowned in disbelief. “These times 
you can hear anything.” 

“But I know the moon children. 
Guy Hood is my nephew. I’ve seen 
the object they call the moon 
jewel. I believe the story’s true. I’d 
like to see Guy again if we can get 
to Fairfax.” 

“My son was married there.” He 
squinted deliberately at the fuel 
gauge and turned to peer at the un- 
easy sea behind us. “Just a couple 
hundred miles. Travel ain’t as easy 
as it used to be — but why not?” A 
shrug announced his decision. “I 
guess we’ve nowhere else to go.” 

T HE land was empty for a good 
many miles. We stopped two or 



three times to investigate 
abandoned vehicles. Elving loaded 
spare cans of fuel from one of them 
and lugged a case of dehydrated 
beef and a plastic bag of water 
from another. 

A militia roadblock stopped us 
at the crest of a long hill. Three 
hollow-eyed young boys manned 
it. 

They stabbed bayonets into the 
pile of rose bushes and asked ner- 
vous questions. When Elving told 
them about my gamma-form in- 
fection they stepped quickly back 
and waved us on. 

For miles we drove beside 
refugee camps. Rocky hills were 
covered with tents and parked 
vehicles. Stragglers were still on 
the road and once a militia convoy 
held us up, crossing ahead of us 
with water tanks and trucks of 
crated food. 

An enormous crowd swarmed 
around an open-air tabernacle on 
one hilltop, so near the road that I 
caught snatches of a hymn brayed 
from a speaker system and 
phrases from a screaming 
preacher warning his congrega- 
tion to prepare itself for the end 
of the world. It had never seemed 
so near. 

Dusty militiamen at a second 
roadblock told us that snakes had 
been reported nesting in the 
higher hills ahead, but Elving re- 
fused to believe it. This whole 
region, he thought, was too low and 
humid for the snakes. When he 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



129 




warned the men about my space 
disease they let us drive on. 

We met no snakes. Those bare 
hills were vacant until we saw a 
half-dressed girl standing by the 
road, waving us to a stop. Elving 
slowed the hearse, but suddenly 
speeded again. Hidden men sprang 
out of the weeds as we went by and 
glass fragments sprayed me from 
sudden holes in our rear windows. 

Out of range, Elving stopped to 
look for damage. When he found 
nothing serious he opened a tin of 
dried meat and offered to share it 
with me. All I wanted was water, 
but he ate with evident relish and 
washed his dentures carefully be- 
fore we went on. 

Beyond these hills the road fell 
into another wide valley. To my 
relief, there was no fog. We drove 
through miles of weed-grown farm- 
land and then across an oddly 
empty space ridged here and there 
with mounds of broken brick that 
looked as dead as Babylon. 

“Transplanet City.” Elving 
nodded at the red mounds. “Trans- 
planet Chemical was located 
here. The main industrial center 
in these parts. Till the ants came.” 

The ants had removed the old 
metal bridges. We had to leave the 
pavement and jolt down a rocky 
detour to a log trestle the militia 
must have built. The road beyond 
climbed again into barren rises 
that seemed vacant until hammer- 
ing bullets dusted me once more 
with broken glass. 



A tire was punctured, too, but 
we kept going long enough to out- 
run three ragged gunmen who 
chased us in an old farm tractor. 
Elving fixed the tire where we 
stopped that night, in a clump of 
trees behind a burned and looted 
country store. He slept a little 
while I sat up to watch. We went on 
at dawn. 

That day we crossed grassy high- 
lands that must have held cattle 
ranches, though I saw nothing 
larger than a frightened rabbit. In 
late afternoon we reached a level 
prairie that sloped gently toward 
a dark shadow along the horizon. 

“Yonder’s Fairfax.” Elving had 
stopped to check the tires and to do 
what he could for me. “Just be- 
yond that ridge it’s the old 
Greenway park.” He rolled the 
tobacco in his jaw thoughtfully. 
“Fairfax could offer us a prob- 
lem. I don’t say this Moon King 
ain’t your nephew. But how do you 
aim to identify yourself?” 

Set against all the other hazards 
we had faced, the question seemed 
at first trivial, yet I found no easy 
answer. We were men. Guy’s 
women, expecting no friends, 
would probably shoot without 
warning. Andy Elving shrugged 
and drove silently on before I 
could think of any reasonable 
solution. 

We passed abandoned farms, 
fields unplowed and buildings 
burned, and crossed another strip 
of pastureland where no cattle 



130 



GALAXY 




grazed. Abruptly, near the ridge 
head, Elving stopped the hearse 
and climbed out to inspect the 
pavement. 

“Cleat tracks,” he muttered. 
“Your brother’s tank.” 

S ITTING up to look, I saw the 
double scar the tank had made, 
wallowing across a muddy field to- 
ward the woods. Elving grunted 
and pointed, and I discovered the 
tank itself parked beneath a tree, 
sloppily camouflaged with a few 
broken branches. A bullet slapped 
the top of the hearse and whined 
away. 

“Your friend Spike Ballou.” 
Elving slid under the wheel. He 
nodded toward a group of horse- 
men riding out of the trees be- 
yond the tank. “I’d rather not meet 
them.” 

They rode hard to intercept us, 
but the hearse was faster. We lost 
sight of them as the road wound in- 
to the wooded ridges beyond the 
tank. In happier times this had 
been a pleasant recreation spot. It 
was now an empty buffer zone 
around Guy’s kingdom. We plowed 
through the frost-seared weeds and 
vines that clotted the unused pave- 
ment, detoured the burned-out ve- 
hicles and felled trees that blocked 
it. Elving braked to a quick stop 
at last, where a bridge was gone. 

The gap was only thirty feet, but 
we found no way across it. That 
final frustration was almost too 
much for me on top of all my 



fatigue and pain, but Elving was 
quietly hopeful that Guy’s girls 
would reach us ahead of Ballou’s 
men. 

Patiently he went to work on a 
signal. My name, we decided, was 
our best password. Mixing motor 
oil with charcoal from the burned 
bridge, he set about printing it on 
a sheet. 

Amid the space war’s madness 
that spot was a paradoxical island 
of peace, sweet with the cool 
natural odors of terrestrial life and 
decay. Clear water gurgled over 
the pebbles. The frost had not 
touched the blue morning-glo- 
ries still shining in the deeper 
shadows. A jay scolded Elving as 
he stretched our sign from a 
tree. Somewhere a woodpecker 
drummed. 

We waited. I must have been 
dozing. I sensed a sudden still- 
ness, then a clatter of hoofs on the 
pavement behind us. That sound 
stopped. There was only the mur- 
mur of the stream until I heard my 
brother’s voice. 

“Now hold your cool.” 

He stepped from behind a 
screen of morning-glories, a rifle 
in his hand. As fat as ever, he 
moved with surprising agility. His 
shapeless coveralls were stiff with 
grease, perhaps from the tank. A 
filthy brimless hat crowned his 
dark Levantine head like a fez. 

“Well, Kimmie. I thought you 
were dead — and you don’t look 
good.” His slow drawl reflected 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



131 




neither pleasure nor surprise. He 
stopped outside the bullet-shat- 
tered window after a wary glance at 
Elving. “What are you doing 
here?” 

“We’re refugees.” I nodded at 
Elving. “From the fog over Pit- 
man. We’re looking for Guy.” 

“You’ll be sorry if you find 
him.” His soiled face opened in a 
grin as if to some gloating recol- 
lection. “I don’t think you'll ever 
see him. His women don’t like us 
human men. But I’m in a position 
to persuade Ballou to let you 
try — if you’ll carry a message for 
us.” 

1 waited. 

“A message from Captain Spike 
Ballou.’’ Tom fumbled the 
crumpled butt of a narcorette out 
of his pocket. With no light for it, 
he sprinkled the last blue grains in- 
to his grimy palm, sniffed them in- 
to his nostrils and sprayed me with 
a sneeze. 

“A message to the women — we 
figure Guy is sleeping now.” A 
slow grin of dull joy had spread 
over his bloated face. He closed his 
glassy eyes and we waited while he 
snuffed his dripping nose two or 
three times with a kind of concen- 
trated greed to save the precious 
juice. 

“Tell them Ballou wants the 
Moon King,” he panted. “Tell 
them to let us at him before he 
wakes up. If they’ll agree to that 
we’ll promise to be tender-hearted. 
Ballou says he’ll let Billie Fran 



come back and take what’s com- 
ing. But if they won’t agree — ”He 
leaned through the broken window 
and I caught pungent narcotic 
fumes mixed with his own stale 
goatishness. “If they won’t play 
our game, we won’t stop with just 
taking care of Guy,” A smothered 
violence burst into his voice. 
“We’ll slaughter all his bastard 
brats — and every slut that’s preg- 
nant by him. Tell ’em that!” 

I shrank from a spray of acrid 
spittle. 

“If they don’t fall for that one — 
and I don’t think they will — here’s 
another offer you can pass along.” 
He chuckled thickly, leaning too 
close to the broken glass. “This one 
is from me personally.” He 
lowered his voice. “You know I 
wouldn’t hurt Guy. My own dear 
son.” He winked at me slyly. “I 
sure don’t want his women— no 
man will ever please them now. All 
I want is the moon jewel — that 
lump of grit he put together. Tell 
Billie Fran to slip me. that and I’ll 
guarantee that Spike Ballou will 
never trouble her again. Personal- 
ly — my pleasure.” 

I wiped my face and asked what 
good the nexode would be to him. 

“Still a schlemiel .” His tone and 
sardonic shrug might have been our 
father’s. “Kimmie, that crazy 
crystal is the only thing worth 
wanting in this insane world. It’s 
knowledge — when you learn how 
to use it. It’s power — look what 
Guy does with it. It’s safety^sfrom 



132 



GALAXY 




the fog and the snakes and the 
space diseases. What good is the 
moon jewel?” He slapped his 
greasy leg and chortled. “Any- 
how, Kimmie, here’s our proposi- 
tion.” Grave again, he waved his 
rifle for emphasis. “We’ll put you 
across the creek. Give the women a 
choice if you get a chance to talk. 
Tell them to give up their king or 
the jewel. Give them till sundown. 
Tell ’em we’re coming in tonight 
with something they can’t stop if 
they balk. You’ll do that?” 

I LOOKED at Andy Elving. He 
shrugged in noncommittal ac- 
ceptance. Tom made us back the 
coach and put us on a gravel side 
road that took us down to a shal- 
low ford and back to the pavement 
beyond the stream. 

“1 don’t care for your brother,” 
Elving muttered. “In fact, I 
wouldn’t claim him.” 

He drove slowly, tooting the 
horn. Once we stopped to wait at 
an old park-service campsite, but 
nobody came out from among the 
trees. He gnawed off another chew 
and our hearse lurched on. Before 
we got back to the pavement a pile 
of rocks stopped us. A little be- 
yond them a heavy chain was 
strung between two trees to bar 
the narrow road. 

Elving tried the horn again. 
When nobody answered he 
climbed over the chain and van- 
ished beyond the screen of vines. 
He was gone a long time. I lay in 



a feverish doze, listening to the 
wind above the trees and a dove 
cooing softly far away until voices 
aroused me. When I propped my- 
self up, Elving was coming back, 
walking modestly in front of two 
girl guards, each uniformed in a 
single wide green garter and a sin- 
gular aura of vibrant joy. 

A short redhead with a rusty old 
double-barreled shotgun, the 
cracked stock bound with black 
tape. A slim long-haired dark girl 
with a bright-tined pitchfork. 
Aglow all over with the pure spirit 
of youth, they handled their 
weapons with a playful gaiety that 
alarmed me. 

“Here they are, Mr. Kim.” Elv- 
ing had to look at them now and 
their vital beauty crinkled his 
brown face into an expression of 
reluctant admiration. “But they 
can’t quite believe who you are.” 

“Sir?” The redhead bent to in- 
spect me doubtfully through the 
shattered glass. “Honest, are you 
really Mr. Hodian?” 

“Guy’s Tio Kim?” The dark girl 
had a soft Spanish accent that 
made me Keem. “From Sky- 
gate?” 

The redhead laughed with sheer 
delight when I nodded. 

“It’s just too grand to be true. 
One night Guy told me a lot about 
you. How you helped him learn to 
talk. How you were good to him 
when he was still too young to help 
himself and how you cared for hiqi 
when other people hurt him. He 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



133 




said he was afraid you were dead. 
He’ll be so glad you came!” 

“Maybe si, maybe no.” The 
dark girl shrugged to toss the sleek 
black mane from her face. “If you 
are Guy’s Tio Keem, I think you 
better prove it. Tell us facts about 
him.” 

“You knew Guy when he was 
tiny?” The eager redhead widened 
immense blue eyes. “I bet he was 
cute as a baby.” 

“Not really,” I said. “The 
beautiful moon children were 
Kyrie Thorsen and Nick 
Marko— 

She looked disappointed and the 
dark girl scowled. 

“Who? Who you say?” 

I discovered then that they knew 
very little about Guy's actual past. 
Though he had told them some- 
thing about his father and me, ap- 
parently his total rejection of 
Nick and Kyrie had caused him to 
deny that he had ever been one of 
the famous Moon Kids. The girl 
guards apparently believed him. 

“Maybe you lie.” The dark girl 
stabbed her pitchfork into the sod 
and bent so close that I caught the 
clean fragrance of her glossy hair. 
“Guy's own bandido father try to 
rob him. Maybe he send you to try 
again.” 

Weak and sweating with alarm, 
I looked at Andy Elving. He was 
chewing steadily and his broad 
stoic face gave me nerve to go on. 

“We're refugees,” I said. “We’re 
running from the space invaders 



and our own fellow men. We need 
Guy’s help. I think he’ll let us stay 
here if you’ll just take us to him.” 
“I’m sure you’ll be welcome — ” 
“Meester, you better make no 
fonny business.” The dark girl 
cut off the redhead. “Maybe you 
don’t tell us everything.” Her jet 
eyes squinted with suspicion. 
“Who show you where to cross the 
river?” 

“We did meet Guy’s father.” I 
nodded uncomfortably. “He gave 
us a message from Mr. Ballou to 
take to Guy’s women.” I caught an 
uneasy breath. “Will you let us 
deliver the message?” 

The dark girl was clearly in com- 
mand. She frowned thoughtfully 
at the redhead and sharply back 
at Elving and me. 

“We give you a choice," she de- 
cided at last. “We let you turn 
around and go back now. Tell Bal- 
lou and Guy’s bandido father the 
mothers want no message from 
them. Or else we take you to the 
mothers—” 

“Take us,” I said. 

“The mothers have Guy's chil- 
dren.” She shook her head, with a 
hard look at Elving and me. 
“They share the power of the 
jewel — enough to know fonny 
business. Maybe they say you 
both okay. But maybe they see 
you not okay and keel you.” 

I turned to Elving. He spat 
delicately away from the girls, in 
the general direction of my 
brother and Spike Ballou. 



134

“No choice,” he muttered. “If 
it’s the mothers or the fog, we’ll 
take the mothers.” 

XIX 

T HE redhead clapped her hands. 

“I think you’re both okay,” she 
said happily. “I just know the 
mothers will let you wait for Guy. 
You’ll have to wait because he’s 
sleeping now. He’ll sleep for two 
or three days and his sleeping 
place is secret. Only the mothers 
know — ” 

“Shhh!” The dark girl hissed at 
her. “Lib, I think you talk too 
much.” She pointed the pitchfork 
at us. “Maybe they work for 
Guy’s bandido father. Maybe they 
come to spy out his sleeping place. 
We wait for the mothers to say.” 
“We wouldn’t hurt Guy,” I told 
her. “He used to be fond of me and 
I believe he’ll want to help us now. 
He always was a strange creature, 
but I believe he means to be 
good — ” 

“He’s grand.” Lib swelled with 
pure happiness. “Just too grand.” 
Her bubbling eagerness moved 
her closer to the hearse. “If you 
knew him always — tell us how he 
used to be.” 

Wondering how much to tell, I 
looked at the dark girl. 

“Say what you like.” She flung 
back her veil of hair, with a gesture 
of spectacular indifference. “The 
mothers will decide.” 

“Thank you, Eva.” Lib beamed 



breathlessly at me. “I want to 
know about Guy when he was a 
baby.” 

“He wasn’t a pretty baby,” I be- 
gan uncertainly. “Though I did 
learn to love him, it wasn’t easy. 
He always seemed^well, more 
animal than human.” 

“He’s more than human now.” 
Devotion rounded her enormous 
eyes. “In every way there is.” 
“Perhaps he has changed since I 
knew him.” Their absolute wor- 
ship had begun to puzzle me. “I 
can’t quite understand how much 
you seem to care for him.” 

“My father used to speak of 
heaven when he prayed,” Eva said. 
“He lived on frijoles and died fight- 
ing weeds in another man’s field. 
But Guy — ’’she caught her breath 
and I saw the dark blaze of pas- 
sion in her eyes — “Guy makes a lit- 
tle heaven here.” 

“Look at me.” Lib preened her- 
self, lifting her pink-nippled 
breasts by raising her arms and 
combing the fingers of both hands 
through her flame-colored hair. 
“Before Guy came I was a miser- 
able thing.” She made a fetching 
face at what she had been. “Bad 
skin. Ugly freckles. Stooped shoul- 
ders and dry hair and crooked 
teeth. Allergies the doctors 
couldn’t cure. And I was afraid of 
men. Just one date was all I ever 
had. A pimply grocery clerk 
wanted to walk me to a church sup- 
per. When he came to pick me up I 
got sick to my stomach. I vomited 



THE AAOON CHILDREN 



135 




right in front of him.” Shaking off 
that depressing recollection, she 
glowed again. “Guy does more for 
me.” 

“Maybe you like to look at me.” 
Eva arched her tawny torso as if to 
challenge Lib. “Guy makes heaven 
for all of us. Maybe you like to 
know what he did for me. You 
know Spike Ballou?” 

She waited for my nod. 

“Before Guy came Ballou found 
me waiting on tables in a helibar 
and picked me to be what he call a 
Poppy-Cola girl. I was supposed 
to be on trivee to sell Poppy-Cola, 
but he wanted to have sex all the 
time — at the conventions of Pop- 
py-Cola salesmen, up in his heli- 
cabin and even on the sofa in his 
private office. Most of the time he 
was too drunk, but he did get me 
pregnant. When his wife found out 
he let me go. With an EZ-Abort 
gun and a fifty-dollar bonus. I got 
another job waiting on tables at 
the Red Raven — and he wouldn’t 
even look at me when he came in.” 
She spat on the ground. “Guy’s 
better.” 

Her luminuous eyes narrowed 
warily at me. 

“Maybe now you see why we 
watch the border.” She gestured at 
the chain across the road. “Guy 
makes a small heaven here, but it’s 
for women only. Men — they all 
want to kill Guy and steal his 
jewel.” 

“Men don’t like Guy.” Lib 
nodded, as if with a passing regret. 



“Take our Presbyterian pastor. I 
used to adore him before Guy 
came. Such a refined, handsome, 
godly man. His voice when he 
prayed used to give me goose- 
pimples. But he joined Spike Bal- 
lou — I can’t imagine why.” She 
tossed her fiery curls. “He slipped 
across the river on an old gray 
mule and found his wife in the barn 
milking the cow. He prayed over 
her till he got her convinced that 
Guy was the devil incarnate. He 
made her hide him in the house and 
help him spy around till he found 
where Guy was sleeping with the 
jewel.” 

“If you plan such tricks as that” 
Eva waved her pitchfork with a 
feline ferocity — “ adids /” 

“The pastor’s wife had come to 
her senses by then,” Lib went on, 
“but he tied her up and broke into 
Guy’s hiding place. If you can 
imagine a minister — he stabbed 
Guy and grabbed the jewel and 
tried to get away.” Merriment 
began to ripple in her voice. 
“Guy’s as hard to wake as he is to 
hurt, but the pastor pulled a boner. 
He left the knife sticking in him. 
That bothered Guy so much he 
awoke long enough to call the 
mothers. They sent a squad of us 
maiden guards to catch the pastor. 
It was the middle of a dead-black 
night, but we could see the shine of 
the jewel. He had it in a sack, but 
somehow it lit him up — and even 
the mule. We caught up with him 
right about there.” She nodded at 



136 



GALAXY 




the rocks in the road. “I sort of 
hated to hurt him, but we’ve got to 
defend Guy’s country.” 

She slapped at a fly crawling 
down her firm pink flank. 

“We hanged the pastor from a 
liveoak tree. Next day the mothers 
tied his body on the old gray mule 
and let it wander back across the 
river as a warning for men to keep 
out. I don't know why, but they 
just can’t learn.” 

Very briefly troubled, she 
frowned toward the road behind 
us. 

“Just last month, Ballou and his 
raiders carried off Billie 
Fran — she’s the first mother. They 
hurt her terribly, trying to make 
her tell where Guy sleeps now and 
where we keep the jewel. But she 
finally found a knife and fought 
Ballou and got away.” 

“Maybe you see now why we 
don’t like men.” Eva leveled the 
long-tined pitchfork into my face. 
“Maybe now you change your 
mind. Maybe you go back to 
Spike Ballou.” 

Elving turned carefully to spit 
aside. 

“We’ll take our chances here.” 
He glanced gravely at me. “1 told 
you Mr. Hodian is sick. He’s had a 
long fight with a gamma-form in- 
fection. You can see he’s not able 
to hurt anybody.” 

Both girls peered at me. Eva’s 
eyes narrowed doubtfully, but 
Lib’s grew round with sympathy. 
“You do look awfully pale and 



bad,” she said. “But you’ll feel bet- 
ter fast if the mothers let you stay. 
Fairfax is a healthy place since 
Guy came. A happy place, 
too — for women, anyhow. Our 
lady doctors can’t understand just 
how the jewel works, now that we 
keep it locked up^^ 

“Careful, Lib.” 

“He’s no spy.” Squealing at Eva 
in a flash of resentment, Lib 
turned pinker all over. “But we do 
have to defend Guy’s country.” 
She smiled soothingly at me. 
“We have to guard the jewel be- 
cause it really is wonderful. Look 
what it did for my Grandma 
Bloodworth.” 

Lib turned her graceful back on 
Eva, who was stirring restively. 

“Ninety-two years old, the day 
she first saw Guy. Dying in a rest 
home. He didn’t even touch her 
then or let her see the jewel, but she 
got well. Her fractured hip knitted. 
Her cancer went away. Her weak 
heart got strong again. She moved 
out of the rest home and back to 
the farm. Now — ” 

Lib turned to giggle at Eva. 

“Guy likes music — a queer sort 
of music we never heard before. 
He’s been teaching some of us to 
play it. Eva used to be the best. But 
Grandma Bloodworth is his 
favorite fiddler now. And I think 
she’s pregnant again.” 

“Who isn’t?” Eva snapped, but 
in a moment she was reflecting 
Lib’s happy adoration. “I told you 
Guy makes a little heaven here.

The mothers say even the weather 
has changed since he learned to 
work the jewel. Maybe they’re 
right. The rain seems to come when 
it should and the hail and the frost 
don’t come when they shouldn’t.” 

1 sat wondering vaguely what 
sort of unexplained interface 
might have been established be- 
tween the forces of the atmosphere 
and the unknown energies of that 
ultimate artifact from the stars. 
Elving spat deliberately and 
spoke to Eva. “Will you take us to 
the mothers now?” 

“Your choice.” She shrugged 
with the lazy grace of a bored 
tigress. "Maybe you’ll be sorry.” 

W ITH an effortless strength 
that amazed me the girls rolled 
two big stones out of the ruts 
ahead. Eva removed a padlock to 
lower the chain. I settled grate- 
fully back against my pillows and 
the hearse lurched ahead. 

When the rocks and the chain 
had been replaced Eva searched the 
hearse for weapons and slid 
cautiously into the rear, her 
pitchfork ready at our backs. Lib 
perched on the front fender, bright 
hair blowing, beckoning casually 
with the old shotgun to guide us. 

We were soon on the pavement. 
As Elving drove on toward Fair- 
fax it seemed to me that we had 
entered a phenomenal circle of joy- 
ous and abounding life. Early 
frosts had already browned the 
arid uplands we had crossed be- 



yond the river, but here we came 
out of the trees into a lush green 
landscape. 

Lib beckoned us to stop beside a 
gnarled old tree, where sprays of 
young leaves and white blooms 
shaded ripe red apples. A 
mockingbird in the tree kept on 
trilling while she picked huge 
apples and tossed them into the 
hearse. I bit into one of them when 
Eva handed it to me. Even though I 
had no appetite, its sweet juice 
made my saliva run. 

Gravely weighing the apple in his 
hand, Elving leaned slowly to spit 
his cud into the dust and impul- 
sively tossed his gnawed plug after 
it. Munching the apple, he drove 
impassively on. 

But that time I was sitting up 
again, feeling unexpectedly re- 
freshed and sharing Lib’s bright 
delight in the exuberant life 
around us. Gaily waving the old 
shotgun, she pointed to a covey of 
quarter-grown quail running be- 
side the road as if it would be 
spring forever. She smiled at a 
suckling calf with a black-spotted 
cow, laughed at a sorrel colt frisk- 
ing across a green alfalfa field, 
clapped at a black stallion mount- 
ing a mare. 

Though Ballou and his raiders 
had managed to burn most of the 
buildings near the river, we were 
soon rolling through an unscarred 
zone where dairy cattle grazed 
near white-painted barns and half- 
clad women sang as they tended the 



138 



GALAXY 




fertile soil. A young girl and a dog 
watched a flock of white sheep. 
Red-painted combines were 
crawling across fields of ripe 
wheat. We overtook two women 
on a wagon loaded with full bags of 
grain. 

In contrast to all the waste and 
chaos we had left beyond the river, 
Fairfax itself was a welcome 
island of peace. The streets were 
clean. Naked children scampered 
about a school playground. When 
we passed a bakery, the smell of 
new bread set my mouth to water- 
ing again. 

A little group of women on 
horseback met us near the court- 
house square. They carried hap- 
hazard weapons — a police pistol, a 
hunting knife, a hatchet, a slung 
deer gun. Their leader was a tall, 
attractively sun-browned girl 
with long yellow hair and a bright 
ironic face. She had a shortbow 
slung behind her and a tiny child 
in her arms. 

Lib gestured us to a halt and 
Eva ran ahead to speak to the 
women. After a few moments the 
yellow-haired girl dismounted 
and they came back to the hearse 
together. I saw long welts across 
the girl’s back, not fully healed, 
and ugly blue marks at her wrists 
and ankles. 

“The first mother,” Eva was 
crisply respectful. “Mother Billie 
Fran Hood. She'll decide about 
you.” 

“So you are Guy’s favorite 



uncle?” Her pleasant voice had a 
slight, childish lisp. She paused to 
catch some murmured word from 
Lib and a quick concern changed 
her tone. “Eva says you’ve been 
ill.” She peered into the hearse 
and I watched her doubts dissolve. 
“You do look bad. I think you 
need the jewel’s power. If Guy 
wants you — ” At last she nodded, 
slowly smiling. “Eva will Find a 
place for you to wait till he wakes 
up.” 

“We have a message,” Elving 
reminded me uneasily. 

“We talked to my brother back 
at the river,” I said. “A man who 
calls himself Todhunter Hoke — ” • 

Her blaze of fury checked me. 

“Go on,” she snapped. “What’s 
the message?” 

“Spike wants Guy,” I said. “My 
brother wants the moon jewel. 
They’re demanding that you give 
up one or the other before sun- 
down. If you refuse, they’re com- 
ing in with an army tank. They’re 
threatening to kill all Guy’s chil- 
dren — ” 

“Let ’em come.” Her scarred 
arms tightened on the lively golden 
infant, who was peering at me as 
brightly as another baby Kyrie. 
Her smile turned defiant. “They’ve 
been here before. If they come 
back they’ll get another lesson.” 

Calm again, she paused to 
bounce her alert wide-eyed child. 
Elving had turned to listen, frown- 
ing. Though I had noticed no 
sound except the ring of fever in 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



139 




my ears, he said he could hear the 
rumble of the tank crawling to- 
ward us over the ridge. I wasn’t 
sure anything could stop it. 

XX 

L IB and Eva escorted us to the 
Fairfax Manor. Twelve stories 
tall, it overlooked the courthouse 
square. The lights flickered now 
and then, as the women had some 
minor difficulty with the stand-by 
generators, but we had no other 
grounds for complaint. With Lib 
and Eva standing guard, we were 
fed abundantly and put into the 
penthouse suite to wait for Guy’s 
awakening. 

In spite of the impending at- 
tack, I felt relaxed and oddly 
happy. Though I hadn’t seen the 
tetrahedron, I believe some ob- 
scure effect from it had begun to 
help my body overcome that old 
space infection. Whatever the 
cause, my pain had gone. My head 
was clear. Once more I enjoyed 
eating. I even found a certain de- 
light in contemplating Guy’s 
girls and the radiance they wore. 
That night I slept well. 

A thudding concussion woke me 
before dawn. The windows shook. 
Somewhere a woman screamed. 
The roar of Spike Ballou’s tank 
was unmistakeable now and I 
knew it was firing into Fairfax. I 
shouted anxiously to find Elving. 

“Out here, Mr. Kim.” His calm 
voice came from the terrace. “I 



think the women are attack — 
huh?” 

A startled gasp cut off his reply. 
Grateful for a sense of health I 
had not felt in two years, I left the 
bed to join him. Yellow flames ex- 
ploded out of a shattered building 
at the street corner across the 
square. Women ran around the 
corner dragging a hose, but sud- 
denly dropped fiat. 

White fire geysered out of a new 
crater in the pavement near them, 
where another incendiary shell 
had fallen. Glass shattered, the 
floor quivered and shell frag- 
ments whined. Stumbling toward 
the parapet, I stopped to stare at 
Elving. He wasn’t watching the 
action in the street. His eyes were 
lifted to the moonlit sky. 

“What—” For the first time in 
my experience, his voice shook 
with amazement. “What unholy 
thing is that?” 

Dread blew cold on the back of 
my neck when I saw what he was 
watching. A silver globe brighter 
than the moon, it dropped out of 
the sky, veered away from the dark 
courthouse, hovered over the 
blazing building at the corner. El- 
ving watched it for what seemed a 
long time before he turned slowly 
to me. 

“I’m a plain man, Mr. Kim,” he 
whispered hoarsely. “1 always 
done my little bit, here or on the 
moon. I think I’ve earned a few 
quiet years. All I wanted now was 
time to grow my roses. I thought 



140 



GALAXY 




we had found the place to do it 
here.” 

Sobs broke his voice. 

“1— I don't like them flying 
snakes, Mr. Kim. Or the metal 
ants or the killer fog or all the 
space diseases. Now here — here’s 
this thing in the sky. At first I 
thought -thought I was outa my 
mind. But it ain’t me. It’s the whole 
world gone wrong, Mr. Kim.” 

He clung to me, shuddering. 

Down in the street, the women 
had vanished. That bright sphere 
dropped again, as if to observe 
the abandoned firehose where it 
writhed like a broken snake on the 
pavement, jetting water at ran- 
dom. The globe hovered as if to in- 
spect the towering flame, then 
drifted slowly upward. 

At about our level it slowed 
again and wheeled over the court- 
house in a curiously hesitant way, 
as if somehow hunting. It came so 
near that I could see the pattern of 
its silver surface-^a curious 
honeycomb of small hexagons. 

Elving gasped and shook his fist, 
but it ignored us. 1 heard a faint 
shrilling as it went by, like the 
whine of the mechanical ants, and 
1 caught a sharp sulphuric scent in 
the air. The ants, I thought, had 
somehow come to invade Guy’s 
kingdom. 

Not far from us the object 
paused. It hung still while another 
shell came wailing down to tear a 
new crater in the courthouse lawn. 
Abruptly it shot into the sky. 



We saw no more of it, but I 
heard the tank again. Its engines 
roared briefly. Its cannon 
thudded rapidly a dozen times. 
Smaller arms crackled in the dis- 
tance. But those sounds died. No 
more incendiaries fell into Fair- 
fax. 

Across the square the women 
returned to the hose. We watched 
until they had the blaze under con- 
trol. Uneasily searching the sky, 
we saw only the pale moon setting 
and a pink dawn glowing. My 
wonder and alarm slowly ebbed 
into a sense of mystic peace and 
fitness I didn’t try to understand. 
Sleepily serene, I went back to bed. 

E LVING woke me at noon with 
news and food. A swarm of 
metal ants had attacked Ballou’s 
tank and scattered his men. Guy 
was still asleep, his kingdom now 
secure. Elving himself had re- 
covered his slow-spoken calm. Lis- 
tening with a new tranquility, I 
cleaned every crumb from the tray 
and fell asleep again. 

Next day I was up before Elving, 
feeling almost drunkenly well. 
We went down for breakfast with 
Billie Fran and our two green-gar- 
tered guards. When we had eaten, 
Elving drove us a few miles out of 
town in the hearse to see what the 
ants had done to the tank. 

It had plowed through a hedge 
into a field of alfalfa. Its cleats 
had torn the dark earth, where it 
attempted to turn. Its fleeing 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



141 




crew had left footprints in a mud- 
dy ditch, but nothing else. We 
found no metal, no ants, not even a 
brimstone odor. 

Elving drove us back slowly, 
looking for a spot where he could 
replant his roses. Ballou’s men 
were scattered, Guy would soon be 
waking to greet us and we all felt 
secure in the shelter of the tetra- 
hedron. 

The space war seemed far away. 
Billie Fran sat beside me, aglow 
with the alluring new vitality that 
all Guy’s women shared, happily 
dangling her little golden daugh- 
ter. The child’s likeness to the 
baby Kyrie still astonished me and 
I wondered if the moon grit had 
created Guy to father a superhu- 
man race, destined to inherit the 
solar system, if not to open a way 
to the stars. 

Those idle speculations were 
rudely cut short. As we parked the 
hearse beside the hotel the child 
screamed in sudden fright. Billie 
Fran gasped and snatched for her 
knife. Elving shouted in hoarse 
alarm. Something bright flashed 
overhead. 

I heard a whine, caught a sul- 
phur scent and saw a bright globe 
skimming past us. It paused 
across the street, above the mas- 
sive cube of glass and granite that 
had housed the Fairfax National 
Bank, and came gently down out- 
side the drive-in window. 

A long panel of joined hexagons 
flexed and dropped to form a 



ramp. Two people stepped lightly 
down it, out of the shadowy ball. A 
man and a girl. Neither was clad, 
though the man carried a folded 
blanket over one arm. They looked 
very fair at first, but the sun 
washed them with glowing gold. 

Nick and Kyrie! 

Dazed, I could hardly breathe. I 
had not expected to see them 
again and their arrival here was as 
unbelievable to me as their ve- 
hicle itself. I ran to meet them, 
stumbled over the curb and reeled 
to a halt in the street — not yet as 
strong as I had felt. 

“Uncle Kim!” 

Illuminated with joy, Kyrie 
darted to hug me. Nick gave me a 
vigorous hand. I stood gaping, 
because they had changed. Both 
stood taller. No longer the skinny, 
big-eyed, troubled child, Nick was 
poised and confident, a golden 
god. 

Kyrie — I looked at her with an 
ache of delight. Long ago a wom- 
an, she had grown into a goddess. 
Yet what touched me was not her 
lean, high-breasted perfection. 
Kyrie loved me. The light in her 
eyes Filled my own with tears. 

“What’s wrong. Uncle Kim?” 
Her lilac scent enveloped me and 
her dear voice was a warm caress. 
“Have you been sick?” 

“I’m all right now,” I told her. 
“Now that you are here.” 

W HEN I looked around for 
Elving and Billie Fran I 



142 



GALAXY 




found the street empty behind me. 
They had fled into the hotel. 1 
turned back and saw a thing that 
jolted my senses. 

Behind Nick and Kyrie the edge 
of that flexible ramp had frayed 
into darting fragments. The frag- 
ments were ants. A stream of them 
came whining toward us through 
the air. Kyrie held out her hand 
and one alighted on it. 

The whole globe, I now discov- 
ered, was made of ants. Sealed in- 
to a honeycomb pattern, their 
bright hexagonal heads formed 
all its outer surface. Their sleek 
black tail balls made the inner one. 
Interlaced limbs knitted them to- 
gether. 

“Ants!" I swayed backward. 
“Are you - prisoners’" 

“If you could see yourself!" 
Kyrie gurgled with delight. “These 
are ours.” She smiled fondly down 
at the thing in her hand. “1 sup- 
pose they are a little like ants, but 
Nick calls them replicating ma- 
chines." 

She was trying to hand the whin- 
ing thing to me. 

“It won't bite you. Uncle Kim.” 
She laughed at my alarm. “Actu- 
ally it won’t harm anybody.” 

To my relief, Nick waved it 
away. 

“Kyrie found the design re- 
corded in the nexode.” He spoke 
with a brisk assurance. "After 
COSMOS had come apart. We 
built the first units at the shop on 
the mesa. They do reproduce 



themselves in underground cen- 
ters, somewhat like insects. But 
really they are only tools. We used 
them to build the tachyon ter- 
minal." 

1 couldn’t quite grasp that until 
the saga of Clayton Carter began 
to emerge from the fading night- 
mare of my long confinement in 
the Pitman hospital. 

“It’s already— already built?” 
Staring at that bright ball of ants, 
I shuddered in spite of myself. “I 
knew a man,” I whispered, “a 
spaceplane pilot, forced down 
near Skygafe. He nearly died get- 
ting out of the desert. In the hos- 
pital he was out of his head. He 
talked about watching the ants at 
work on the terminal tower until 
they frightened him away. But 1 
was afraid to believe — ” 

“It's there,” Kyrie told me. 
“Ten miles high.” 

Awed, I could only nod. 

“Too bad your friend lost his 
nerve," she added. “Nick’s par- 
ents and my mother have been 
gathering a little colony of refu- 
gees. They hoped for a long time 
that you would turn up.” 

“The starships?” Wonder caught 
my throat. “Have the starships be- 
gun to come?” 

Suddenly troubled, Kyrie shook 
her head. 

“The terminal's complete, but 
not yet operational.” Nick 
frowned, too. “We haven’t got the 
beacon going. It turns out that we 
must have the nexode to modu- 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



143 




late the tachyon signal. We’ve 
failed to find a substitute. I 
thought the whole project was 
dead until Kyrie located the 
nexode here.” 

He nodded toward the bank 
building as if he already knew 
where Guy and his women kept 
the tetrahedron. 

“You can’t have the moon 
jewel.” I was gasping. “Guy won’t 
let you take it.” 

“It’s bad, Uncle Kim.” Kyrie’s 
lips quivered. “I knew poor dear 
Guy would be hurt and I made 
Nick look for another way. But he 
says there simply isn’t any other 
way. We’ve come to take the nex- 
ode — ” 

Her shivery whisper died. Lips 
parted, eyes black, she stared up 
the street. The golden glow drained 
out of her skin, leaving her a fig- 
ure of frozen terror in white ala- 
baster. She had seen Guy. 



XXI 

I HAD been vaguely aware of a 
flurry of footsteps and hushed 
voices behind us, but Guy was 
alone when I turned. He came 
down the middle of the silent 
street, walking with a sort of roll- 
ing swagger. Naked, he was as 
male and nearly as huge as a bull. 

Though little taller than Nick or 
Kyrie, he must have weighed a 
good quarter-ton. The short glossy 
fur had turned black across his 



back and his massive shoulders, 
cream-colored over his great belly. 
His yellow eyes slitted warily as 
he drew near and his black-tipped 
ears cocked toward the ball of 
ants. 

Their high-pitched song grew 
sharper. That black gangway 
rolled itself up and sealed itself 
neatly into the round bright 
honeycomb. The globe rose a lit- 
tle, floated lightly forward, set- 
tled again near us, where it blocked 
Guy’s path. 

He roared. His belly-deep rattle 
was not loud, yet it chilled me even 
in that hot sunlight. It had the 
menace, I thought, of a starved lion 
challenged for his kill. Guy rolled 
on, unstopable as an avalanche. 

Kyrie darted suddenly to meet 
him. 

That savage rumble died. He 
stopped, trembling and breath- 
ing hard. As his red lips drew back, 
I saw that even his teeth had 
grown. He stood grinning down at 
Kyrie, long white fangs drooling 
saliva. 

“Ky!" Nick cried out beside 
me, sharply. “Come back.” 

But she ran on. 

“Dear Guy!” She laughed with 
evident delight. “How strong 
you’ve grown — ” 

He wrapped her in his bulging 
arms. She reached up to stroke his 
shoulders, tiptoed to kiss his 
sleek-furred cheek. He shuddered 
and whimpered and crushed her 
fiercely against him. 



144 



GALAXY 




“Guy, don't! You’re hurting — ” 

He moaned and let her go. 
Growling, he glared at Nick. His 
yellow eyes blinked when he saw 
me. His ears cupped toward me. 
With a ferocious smile he sham- 
bled to meet me, extending a gi- 
gantic furry paw — it had grown 
great black claws, which now were 
safely sheathed. 

“They told me you were here.” 
His slow thick voice was almost as 
alarming as his roar. “I’m glad, 
Uncle Kim. You were always 
good to me. You’re welcome 
here.” 

Snarling ominously, he swung 
back toward Nick. 

“Shake hands!” Kyrie gasped. 
“Please — ” 

Gravely, Nick offered his hand. 
Guy made no move to take it. He 
swayed slowly back and forth, his 
narrowed eyes flickering be- 
tween Nick and the globe of dron- 
ing ants. 

“Why did you come?” His voice 
was a modulated growl, barely in- 
telligible. “What do you want?” 

“I hope you can forgive us, 
Guy — ” Nick began. 

“Please!” Kyrie stopped him. 
“Let me talk to Guy.” 

Guy bristled his stiff gray neck- 
hair at Nick, flared his ears to- 
ward the strident globe, swung 
slowly back to Kyrie. His wide 
face twitched beneath the fur and 
tears welled out of his tawny eyes. 
Poised on the balls of his feet like a 
boxer, he bent his ears toward her. 



“Guy+«dear Guy!” Her low 
voice broke, but she gulped and 
went on. “Don’t you know why we 
exist? The grit from the messen- 
ger missile had been lying mil- 
lions of years on the moon, wait- 
ing for any intelligence to come 
and use it. It changed our fathers 
when they got there, so that we 
were born. We’re here for a pur- 
pose. Can’t you see that, Guy? 

His only reply was to bounce 
slightly aside, as if evading a blow. 

“You know why we were born.” 
Her voice turned desperate. 
“We’re to set up the transgalac- 
tic terminal, so the starships can 
come. That’s all we’re for.” 

His ears flicked toward the clus- 
tered ants. 

“The starships will bring peace 
among the biocosms,” she prom- 
ised him. “The transgalactic cul- 
ture will help us understand our 
neighbors and ourselves. It will 
stop the space war, Guy. It will end 
all our troubles with the snakes 
and the fog and the alien bio- 
forms — ” 

“But, Ky, they don’t bother us.” 
Guy grumbled and erupted like a 
volcano finding a voice. “We’ve 
got a good place here, so we don’t 
need the starships. I want Uncle 
Kim to stay. And you, Ky — ” He 
uttered a low, hoarse sound, half 
sob and half moan. “I want 
you — so much it kills me, Ky.” He 
shuddered and blinked and swung 
toward Nick like a boxer feinting. 
“Nick had better leave.” 



THE MOON CHILDREN

“Please, Guy!” Pale and 
shaking, K,yrie clutched his arm. 
“You aren’t as safe as you think. 
Not for long. We had to send the 
replicators — the ants — to stop a 
tank attack while you were 
asleep.” He was ducking back, but 
she clung to his arm. “Guy, Guy! 
You’ve just got to understand.” 

He trembled and stood still, 
quivering ears lifted toward her. 

“The star people sent the grit.” 
Her high voice quavered and raced 
too fast for Guy, who stood shak- 
ing himself in a dull, bewildered 
way. “They knew young cultures 
often kill each other on con- 
tact — before they learn to under- 
stand one another. The grit was 
sent to help us save all our planets. 
But we've already made too many 
mistakes. If we don’t get the ter- 
minal open soon, Guy — very 
soon — we’ll all be dead.” 

“Get — away!” His great throat 
rattled. “Just leave me alone.” 

“We can’t, Guy.” Kyrie wet her 
pale lips: “We’ve got to have your 
help. You see, the replicators 
have the terminal almost done, 
but we can’t light the beacon to 
guide the starships to earth with- 
out — without — ” 

She faltered and stopped, quiver- 
ing with pain. 

“We need the nexode, Guy.” 
Nick’s level voice was slow at first, 
clipped and intense. “Ky made 
me try everything else, but we 
can’t energize the beacon with- 
out it.” His words came faster and 



faster, as they always did when he 
was under stress. “I hope you’ll try 
to be reasonable, Guy. Perhaps 
we won't need the nexode long. 
When the ships arrive with new 
equipment we should be able to re- 
turn — ” 

“You always had everything.” 
Guy drowned him, thundering like 
a rising hurricane. “You had 
brains. You had charm. You had 
a father and a mother. You had 
each other. You could talk and 
you stayed awake and you did 
things — ” 

“Guy, Guy!” Kyrie cried. “You 
know I always loved you — ” 

His ruthless paw swept her aside. 

“You always took everything.” 
He danced like a fighter at Nick, 
moving with surprising tigerish 
grace. “You took the jewel when I 
was slow to use it. You took Ky.” 

“No!” Kyrie sobbed. “Guy, you 
don’t realize — ” 

“Now I do.” His drumming 
boom cut her off. “I realize the 
jewel is mine. I made it. My father 
helped me take it. I need it. Now I 
mean to keep it. I won’t give it up. 
Not for you. Uncle Kim.” His yel- 
low eyes blazed at me with a para- 
lyzing power. “Not for Ky. Not 
for anybody." 

T HE street was quiet for a mo- 
ment, except for Guy’s harsh 
breathing and the shrilling of the 
ants. The hot air stirred around us 
and I caught a whiff of Guy’s barn- 
yard rankness. 



146 



GALAXY 




“This will hurt you, Guy.” Nick 
was brisk and cool. “It will hurt 
Ky, too. I don’t like it, either, but 
you’ve left us no alternative. 
We’ve come for the nexode. We’re 
going to take it.” 

Guy crouched toward him like 
some great cat. 

“Ky has located it here in the 
bank vault. The replicators won’t 
take long to dig it out. We don’t in- 
tend to hurt you, Guy. I hope you 
won’t attempt to interfere — ” 

Guy charged. 

“Stop it!” Kyrie screamed. “If 
you love me — ” 

Nick jumped back. Though I ob- 
served no signal, that bright ball 
exploded into individual ants. 
Whining like hornets, they 
swarmed around Guy. Their sul- 
phuric reek burned my eyes. 

Bellowing, Guy plowed into the 
swarm. Ants dived at him. The 
bright sun dimmed, as they sucked 
at his energy. I staggered back, 
numb and shuddering from the 
sudden cold in my bones, sick with 
the bitterness in my mouth. 

Guy bawled with rage and pain, 
but the ants failed to stop him. I 
never knew why. Perhaps some ef- 
fect of the tetrahedron shielded 
him. Perhaps some effect of 
Kyrie’s terror slowed the ants. 
More simply, I suppose, Nick 
couldn’t kill Guy, while Guy knew 
no inhibiting compunctions. 

His furious paws batted the ants 
away from his head. When Kyrie 
darted in he flung her aside. Cruel 



claws open, he caught Nick by the 
throat, shook him until I heard his 
neck snap, flailed at the flying ants 
with Nick’s lax body, finally 
tossed it toward Kyrie’s feet. 

Nick jerked and lay still. Kyrie 
shrieked and dropped beside him. 
A stranger thing — the ants died. 
Their shrilling ceased. Their 
bodies clattered on the pavement, 
jangling like a shower of old 
clocks. 

Suddenly the sun shone bright 
again. Beneath its heat the court- 
house square lay hushed and deso- 
late. Kyrie kneeled over Nick. His 
flat body looked small as a child’s, 
its color slowly fading to a fright- 
ful whiteness. Guy towered over 
them, rocking back and forth like 
a groggy boxer. All I could hear 
was his rough breath and Kyrie’s 
piteous sobs. Black bitterness 
lingered in my throat. 

S WEAT ran down Guy’s heaving 
body, painting uneven streaks in 
his pale ventral fur. His gamy 
musk clogged my nostrils. His 
panting breath was now accom- 
panied by a broken vocal sound, a 
slow and meaningless moaning. 
He shook himself at last and bent 
slowly over Kyrie. Long claws 
sheathed, he fumbled at her quiv- 
ering shoulder. 

“Why, Kyrie? Why?” His moan- 
ing became a tormented voice. 
“You knew I couldn’t give the 
moon jewel away. Why did 
you — ” 



THE MOON CHILDREN

“Murderer!” She stiffened be- 
neath his clumsy paw and her 
slashing shriek cut him off. “You 
stupid monster! You’ve murdered 
Nick. Murdered the terminal. 
Murdered the world.” 

Guy’s ears drooped. He shook 
his great flat head in a dull, bewil- 
dered way, like a punch-drunk 
fighter. Reeling backward, he 
stumbled over one of the fallen 
ants, picked it up with an awk- 
ward paw, stood blinking at it 
blindly. With a stifled howl he 
hurled the dead machine against 
the granite wall of the bank and 
ran blundering up the street. 

, Andy Elving and Billie Fran had 
taken refuge in the hotel. They 
came back when Guy was gone. 
We carried Nick inside and called 
a doctor. She confirmed that he 
was dead. His neck was broken. 
His heart had stopped. His skull 
had caved in when Guy had slam- 
med him against the pavement. 

Intrigued by Nick’s anatomy, 
the doctor wanted to do an au- 
topsy. Kyrie objected wildly. She 
stayed beside Nick, I think with 
some desperate hope of his re- 
covery. Recalling how often the 
children had baffled common 
human medicine, I shared that 
hope till it was gone. 

When the body began to swell 
and decompose even Kyrie gave 
up. Elving had nailed a plain 
wooden coffin together, and we 
carried Nick to the Fairfax cem- 
etery in our own hearse. Guy and a 



dozen of his women walked si- 
lently behind it. 

We held no formal ceremony. 
The forms we knew seemed not to 
fit. I did breathe a prayer, how- 
ever, to whatever powers might be 
concerned with the moon children 
and the survival of mankind and I 
saw several women kneeling. 
Guy and Kyrie stood bowed by the 
grave for a long time after it was 
filled, walked away hand in hand. 

“ — to show you’re truly sorry," 
Kyrie was saying, as they came 
within my earshot. “You can 
bring the nexode and come with 
me back to the terminal. I don’t 
know what we can do without 
Nick. But at least we can try to 
light the beacon.” 

Guy halted and she swung anx- 
iously to face him. 

“Now you’re the silly one, Ky,” 
he rumbled gently. “1 don’t like 
hurting you, but I can’t leave Fair- 
fax. Did you know I was happy 
here, Ky? For the first time ever. 
Because people needed me. Be- 
cause they loved me as I am. They 
still do, Ky, even if I did kill Nick.” 
“But, Guy — ” 

“Anyhow, we can’t get to Sky- 
gate.” His rising growl drowned 
her protest. “It’s too far. The fog 
is coming up the rivers and the 
snakes are on the mountains and 
men like my father are hunting 
other men. Sorry, Ky.” 

Sullen now, he stalked away. His 
silent women followed. Kyrie 
stood marble-white and marble-

quiet, staring bleakly at the 
grave, until Elving and I urged 
her into the hearse. 

We returned to the hotel. As we 
left the hearse she picked up one of 
the lifeless ants. She examined it 
with an air of absent and indif- 
ferent wonder, as if it had been 
perhaps the fossil skeleton of 
some long-extinct trilobite. 

“Could you start the ants 
again?” A spark of hope had stir- 
red me. “They could carry some 
of us back to Skygate, maybe 
with the nexode if Guy would ever 
let it go — ” 

“I can’t, Uncle Kim.” A cold fi- 
nality dulled her voice, and she 
dropped the motionless ma- 
chine. “Because they belonged to 
Nick. His brain controlled them 
through resonant interfaces with 
the nexode spectrum. In a way 
they were members of his own 
body. They all died with him.” 

We took her into the hotel. She 
wouldn’t eat and she didn’t want to 
talk. When we found her a room, 
she locked herself in. I didn’t see 
her again for several days. And 
presently I found it queerly hard 
to remember her grief. 

In spite of all the staggering 
impact of her tragedy, the nexode 
must have still been at work. 
Though the nature of its effect 
was still a riddle to me, I felt as if 
it were somehow radiating life 
and love and joy, bathing us all in 
an invisible ambiance of vital op- 
timism. 



I MMERSED in that atmosphere 
of blithe tranquility, Elving gen- 
ially declared he never expected to 
need his tobacco again. He had 
found a bed for his roses in the 
city park. I spent two or three sun- 
ny afternoons with him there, 
watching him prepare the soil and 
sharing his pleased wonder at all 
the plants budding and blooming 
around us as if they were immune 
to winter. 

Though Lib and Eva still es- 
corted us, they were becoming 
more playmates than guards. 
Their petty tensions at the border 
had mellowed here into a sisterly 
affection and they had begun to 
smile at us so warmly that I was 
afraid Guy would be offended 
when he woke. 

As for myself, I was still conva- 
lescent, eating well and sleeping 
most of the time, intoxicated 
with a joy of life I had once forgot- 
ten and no more concerned with 
the space war and the dead beacon 
than if they had been incidents in 
the history of another planet. 

Relaxing in Guy’s world, I had 
begun to feel that it might be- 
come a small heaven for Elving 
and me as well as for his wom- 
en — until one night the weather 
changed. 

The day before had been bright 
and fine. I had gone to bed in our 
penthouse suite with the windows 
open. A howling wind woke me at 
about midnight. Icy gusts whip- 
ped me as I tried to close the win- 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



149 




dows and my throat became 
choked with bitter dust. The storm 
had died when I woke again, but a 
hard glitter of frost had fallen over 
the city. 

If Guy’s kingdom had been a 
shielded oasis of eternal spring, 
some inexplicable thrust had 
shattered the shield. Reluctant to 
get out of bed, I thought I could 
feel that space infection aching 
again in my bones. Elving looked 
dull and depressed when he wan- 
dered in to go down to breakfast 
with me and he confessed that he 
hankered for a comforting chew 
of tobacco. 

We found Lib alone on guard. 
Eva was in the hospital, she told 
us, after a sudden miscarriage. 
As wan and bleak as if she herself 
had been the patient, she doled out 
more tales of disaster while we 
were slowly discovering we had 
no appetite for breakfast after 
all. 

The unexpected storm and frost 
had blighted crops all around Fair- 
fax. Scores of young animals were 
mysteriously dying. A crazed 
stallion had thrown a twelve-year- 
old girl and trampled her to death. 
The mothers reported that Guy 
had been tossing and moaning all 
night in his sleep. 

“We don’t know what has gone 
wrong.” Lib gnawed her bloodless 
lips. “Mother Billie Fran first 
thought perhaps the jewel had 
been stolen, but the mothers on 
guard say it’s still in the vault. 



We’re afraid it’s somehow ruined 
or broken. The mothers say its 
light flickered and dimmed an 
hour before the storm hit.” She 
shrugged dismally, hunched and 
shivering as if she needed more 
than a garter to keep her warm. 
“Guy’s still asleep and nobody 
knows anything.” 

Even Guy had been aroused, 
however. We were still sitting 
over our unfinished meal when I 
heard him booming in the lobby. 
His belligerent bounce was gone 
when we went out to greet him and 
his yellow eyes looked bleared and 
hollow. 

He was waiting for Kyrie and he 
didn’t want to talk. We stood there 
a long time, shuffling about and 
watching the elevators in uneasy 
apprehension until at last Billie 
Fran brought her down. Looking 
pinched and pale, she came out to 
face him with an expression of 
blank apathy, as if he had been 
some unpleasant stranger she 
didn’t care to meet. 

“Ky, I’ve been asleep.” His 
voice was flat and too loud, as if to 
challenge some unuttered appre- 
hension. “I dreamed^I dreamed I 
was Nick.” 

Kyrie gasped and stared. 

“I dreamed about the tach — the 
tachyon terminal.” Guy shook 
his head and paused to peer around 
him, as if uncertain where or who 
he was. “I dreamed we had to get 
that beacon working.” 

“Yes?” Kyrie breathed. “Yes?” 



150 



GALAXY 




“That’s what we’ve got to do, 
Ky.” His forced, toneless voice al- 
most denied his words. “We’re go- 
ing to Skygate. We’re taking the 
jewel. We’ll try to energize the 
beacon for Nick.” 

“Oh, Guy!” Kyrie swayed and 
caught at the back of a chair. The 
disbelief on her thin face changed 
to breathless wonder and at last 
to a dazzle of delight. “Nick 
would love you,” she whispered. 
“He’d forgive you — if we could 
only light the beacon — ” 

G UY’S women were less enthusi- 
astic. Already stunned by the 
storm and the frost, they were 
soon furious or weeping. Guy was 
sick and out of his mind, they said. 
His place was here with them and 
his babies. They all adored him 
and they couldn’t live without him. 

Yet here in his own kingdom 
Guy was clearly the king. When he 
raised his voice the uproar ceased. 
With a level of intelligence he had 
not displayed to me before, he be- 
gan discussing plans for the trip, 
at first with Kyrie only but soon 
including Elving and me. 

We decided to drive the hearse, 
the sturdiest vehicle available, El- 
ving set about collecting spare 
parts, tires, drums of fuel. Guy 
called on his women for weapons 
and supplies. We pooled our scant 
knowledge of the fog areas and the 
militia posts and the roads pos- 
sibly still open. 

For weapons we had two hunt- 



ing rifles, an ancient but accurate 
target pistol and a lightweight 
missile launcher that Guy had cap- 
tured when he had ambushed an 
earlier raid of Spike Ballou’s. 
There were only two or three boxes 
of ammunition for the guns and 
nine rounds for the launcher. 
Against fog and snakes and ban- 
dits ours seemed a meager arsenal. 

Guy’s new determination re- 
mained surprisingly firm in the 
face of all the hazards ahead of us. 
Yet his behavior troubled me. His 
normally voracious appetite was 
gone. His movements seemed 
weak and uncertain. His great 
paws had developed a tremor he 
could not control. His eyes looked 
swollen and dull and his voice had 
lost its old booming power. I be- 
gan to wonder if he had contrac- 
ted some unique disease. 

When everything else was ready 
he waddled heavily across the 
street to the bank and returned 
with the nexode. 

Kyrie cried out with delight 
when he put the splendid pyramid 
into her hands. Its radiation 
swiftly browned her bright face and 
somehow restored most of the 
vital beauty that Nick’s death had 
drained out of her. She stood 
clutching it, peering raptly into its 
‘glowing hollows, until Guy re- 
placed it in the box in which he had 
stored it. 

Billie Fran ran after us when we 
went out to the coach, holding up 
Guy’s bright-eyed daughter. Hys- 



THE MOON CHILDREN

terical, she wanted to go with us. 
She loved Guy. So did little Val- 
kyrie. If he left them, they would 
die. Spike would come back and 
murder them. 

Guy stopped and turned to lis- 
ten. His shaking paws took the 
naked baby for a moment. Sud- 
denly he pushed it back at Billie 
Fran. With an inarticulate howl 
he blundered blindly after us and 
squeezed his odorous bulk into the 
hearse. 

Armed women crowded around 
the coach as Andy Elving tried to 
pull us away from the curb. Lib 
and Eva were there, both white-lip- 
ped with rage. Eva threw a rock 
that might have smashed the wind- 
shield if Kyrie hadn’t leaned out to 
field it deftly. They all fell back, 
however, from Guy’s bel- 
low — which I thought echoed more 
agony than anger. He was sob- 
bing convulsively as we drove 
away. Most of the women fell si- 
lent behind us but Billie Fran con- 
tinued shrieking and waving 
Guy’s naked child over her head 
for as long as I could see her. 



A NDY ELVING was driving us 
through Greenway Park, a 
dozen miles out of Fairfax, when 
we splashed into the river ford. He 
gasped and collapsed halfway 
across. The hearse stalled. Guy 
lifted Andy from the wheel and I 
drove the hearse out of the river. 
Andy was conscious again by the 



time we reached the bank, gasping 
brokenly that he would be okay, 
but I saw that his haggard face 
had turned cyanotic. Over his 
hoarse protests, we bundled him in 
blankets and drove ingloriously 
back to Fairfax through storm- 
leveled, frost-blackened fields. 

The nurses at the hospital 
squealed with delight to have an- 
other glimpse of Guy and dutifully 
rushed Andy into the cardiac 
room. I shook his lax blue hand 
and promised to have his roses 
tended while he got well. In an- 
other hour, badly shaken and de- 
flated, we set out once more. 

At the wheel when we crossed 
the ford again, I was thinking of 
all the hard miles and unknown 
hazards ahead and missing Andy 
very much. Kyrie sat with me, 
forebodingly silent as 1 was. Guy 
was lying in the back, breathing 
heavily and apparently asleep. 

Kyrie caught her breath as we 
lurched up the rocky bank, and I 
saw a man stumbling into the road 
ahead. A reeling monument of 
pure disaster, he was hatless and 
tattered, slick with dripping 
muck, splashed with blood. When 
his thumb jerked up I recognized 
my brother Tom. 

Reflexively, I speeded the hearse 
and twisted the wheel to veer 
around him. Wildly waving both 
muddy arms, he jumped into our 
path again. I hit the horn and tried 
to nerve myself to run him down, 
but Kyrie was tugging at my arm. 



152 



GALAXY 




“Stop. It’s Guy’s father.” 

I stopped unwillingly. Torn came 
limping to us. He was short of 
breath, scratched and torn, coated 
with evil-smelling mud. Bright 
blood smeared his sleeves and his 
hands and the hilt of a knife in his 
belt. Clinging to the side of the 
hearse, he smiled grimly through 
his mask of red-spattered grime. 

“Kimmie!” His wheezy voice 
tried to be ingratiating. “Kyrie, 
doll!” He ogled her lean golden 
nudity and turned to peer into the 
back of the hearse, where Guy was 
stirring uneasily on a blanket. 
“My son! How is my dear son?” 
“We were better,” I said, “be- 
fore we met you.” 

“Now don’t play the nudnik , 
Kim.” He frowned impatiently at 
me and turned more hopefully to 
Kyrie. “All I need is a ride. Seems 
I’ve worn out my welcome here. I 
heard you here before and I was. 
hoping you’d be back.” He touched 
his knife and leaned again to grin 
slyly at Guy. “By the way, your 
women won’t have any more trou- 
ble from our friend Spike Ballou.” 
“You killed him?” I recoiled 
from that casual implication. 
“Why?” 

“Why not?” Tom turned to lis- 
ten warily at the green wilderness 
behind him, new sweat gleaming 
on his face. “Let’s go.” His 
lowered voice grew urgent. “Be- 
fore somebody gets around to cut 
us off. Whatever you’re up to. I’ll 
lend a hand.” He swung per- 



suasively back to me. “How about 
it, Kimmie?” 

His smooth appeal recalled all 
the times in the past when he had 
spoiled things for me and I wanted 
to say we had no time to help him. 

“Please, Uncle Kim,” Kyrie 
stopped me softly. “Maybe he 
can take Mr. Elving’s place.” She 
looked gravely up at Tom. “Lis- 
ten, Mr. Hood. We’re on our way 
to Skygate. The tachyon ter- 
minal is standing there, complete 
but dead. We have to get there with 
the nexode to light the beacon. 
Maybe you can help us.” 

“The nex — ” Something took 
Tom’s breath. His fat face flick- 
ered with a dozen conflicting ex- 
pressions, the last a bland smile. 
“You have the moon jewel? Here in 
the car? Of course I’ll go with you. 
A chance I never expected. My 
last chance, perhaps, to pay my 
debts to the human race and may- 
be to see a better world than I was 
born in.” 

“I think we need you, Mr. 
Hood.” 

I wanted again to object, but Ky- 
rie had already opened the door on 
her side of the coach. Serenely un- 
disturbed by Tom’s rank filth, she 
slid over to make room for him at 
her side. All I could do was drive 
on. 

T OM asked about weapons and 
Kyrie had Guy pass a deer rifle 
to him. He tested the action and 
loaded it expertly. A few miles 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



153 




farther on, where the trees began 
to thin, he made me stop while he 
took the rifle and slipped ahead. 
After a wait we heard three rapid 
reports, muffled by the foliage. 

Kyrie nodded for me to go on. 
We found Tom waiting where the 
road broke out of the trees a half- 
mile ahead. He had acquired a 
well-worn hat, a police pistol with 
a cartridge belt and a blood- 
smeared deck of narcorettes. 
Smugly silent, he lit one of them 
and climbed in with Kyrie. 

Delayed by missing bridges and 
turned back by road blocks, we 
made camp that night in the 
burned ruin of a barn not fifty 
miles from Fairfax. Speaking for 
Guy, Kyrie announced that she 
and I and Tom would stand equal 
watches. When 1 awoke at day- 
light the camp was silent. I 
couldn’t find Tom. 

In disdain of such inventions as 
sleeping bags, Guy and Kyrie lay 
side by side on the scorched con- 
crete that had been the barn floor 
and I stood frozen for an instant, 
shocked by the contrast between 
her long-limbed loveliness and his 
gigantic beastial and naked male- 
ness. 

Shuddering to obscure emotions 
stronger than my anger over Guy’s 
defection, I shook them awake. 
We searched the camp. 1 found the 
nexode’s empty case tossed into a 
pile of charred rubble near the 
hearse. 

“Tom’s gone,” I told them, my 



outrage tempered with a certain 
secret satisfaction, because I 
had wanted not to pick him up. 
“Gone with the nexode!” 

Guy rumbled in speechless fury, 
ready to join me in pursuit, but 
Kyrie advised us to wash and 
make breakfast. Tom came back 
while we were eating, waddling 
wearily, swinging the nexode in a 
burlap bag. With an air of sullen 
submission, he rolled it out of the 
bag at Kyrie’s feet. 

“ Gevalt /” He shivered and 
wheezed, shrinking away from the 
blazing tetrahedron. “That 
damn thing’s too much for me.” 
Kyrie picked it up and paused to 
blow and brush the dust from its 
bright triangles. It washed her 
skin with a richer tan as she smiled 
across it at Tom. 

“I was depending on it to bring 
you back,” she told him gently. 
“We’ve got a long way to go and 
we still need you, Mr. Hood.” 

“I’ll do what you say.” Tom’s 
instant agreement astonished me. 
“Anything you say.” 

She pointed at the water trough 
and found him a pair of clean cov- 
eralls that had been packed for 
Andy Elving. In moments we 
were on our way again. 

FUTURITY 

XXII 

T HE interface between Tom and 
the tetrahedron was too subtle 



154 



GALAXY 




for me to grasp — if interface is an 
adequate word for that invisible 
thing. He was strangely changed, 
almost a human metamorph. Un- 
wontedly subdued, he rarely spoke 
and then generally with the Yid- 
dish intonations he had learned 
from our father and abandoned 
in his youth. He obeyed Kyrie’s 
soft-spoken requests without ob- 
jection and sometimes he even lis- 
tened to me. 

Guy became our leader, dis- 
playing a resourceful cunning 
that surprised me. I suppose his 
long war with Spike Ballou had 
taught him how to deal with ban- 
dits, but 1 never understood 
where he had received his new in- 
sight into people or his uncanny 
sense for traps and ambushes. 

His huge eyes shone at night 
with a golden phosphoresence 
and he could see to drive through 
blackness that seemed absolute 
to me. Again and again he stopped 
us to wait while he crept through 
the dark ahead to break up a road- 
block and return with a captured 
weapon or a sack of supplies. 

We moved cautiously, keeping 
away from streams and valleys 
when we could. Often we had to 
turn back from an unexpected 
lake of fog. One frosty moonlit 
night we crossed a wild white river 
of it on a long highway bridge the 
ants had somehow left. 

Again, trapped by an uneasy 
white sea rising behind us, we 
waited through most of a day for 



the wind and sun to clear the fog 
from a shallow wash still damp 
from rain. Guy had gone to sleep in 
the back, as inert and odorific as 
something dead, and Tom took 
the wheel to drive us through the 
gray wisps and tatters still crawl- 
ing out of the mud. 

As we lurched and splashed 
through the pools of thin red slime 
the fog had left among the rocks at 
the bottom of the wash, I saw scat- 
tered bones beside the road, bones 
of a horse and a man. Beneath one 
lifting shred of mist I caught sight 
of something else — a flat and end- 
less ribbon of livid red flesh, 
trapped there in the clotting mud, 
writhing and squalling among the 
red bones as if tortured by the sun. 

I was shivering and nearly ill 
for the rest of the day from a shock 
I couldn’t understand. I had seen 
space aliens before and far too 
many remains of my unlucky fel- 
low men. What unnerved me was 
the agony in that thin squalling. It 
had sounded like a human child. 

In the beginning Guy was awake 
and active for two or three days at 
a time, exhausting the rest of us. 
As we went on, however, he slept 
more often and for longer periods 
but with no benefit that I could see. 

He always awoke petulant and 
feverish, parched with thirst. The 
tremor of his paws was growing. 
worse. He complained of weak- 
ness and giddiness and strange 
aching pains in every part of his 
body. And he had been dreaming. 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



155 




H E USED to tell Kyrie about 
his dreams, hoping she could 
explain them. He was never him- 
sell, he said, but always Nick. He 
was always on his way to the ter- 
minal tower or already there, 
working to energize the tachyon 
beacon. 

“It frightens me, Ky,” I heard 
him mutter. “Everything is too 
plain — too real. I see every part of 
the terminal — I understand all 
the parts of it the way Nick did.” 

He drew a harsh, uneven breath. 
“In those dreams, Ky — I am 
Nick. I think the way he did. I re- 
member all he knew. And the 
worst — the worst part is what I 
think of Guy.” His paws came up 
in a searching way to rub his furry 
face as if seeking to identify him- 
self. “I’m sorry for Guy. The poor, 
stupid beast, born all wrong. I 
know he’s good for nothing. I try 
to tolerate him. Because Kyrie 
used to like him. But I’m afraid of 
him, too. I know he hates me be- 
cause he wants Kyrie. But I don’t 
know what he can do to hurt us, be- 
cause even he doesn’t know his own 
power.” 

He struck at the air with great 
open paws as if fighting off some 
unseen enemy, his long claws un- 
sheathed and shining like black 
glass. 

“What’s wrong, Ky?” he whis- 
pered hoarsely. “Am I crazy?” 

“I’m sure you aren’t insane.” 
She stroked his trembling arm 
consolingly. “You may have 



picked up some space infection, 
but I think the nexode is causing 
your dreams, Guy. I think it has 
begun to make an interface with 
you.” 

“What face?” Raw terror rasped 
his throat. “What’s an interface? 
What’s happening to me?” 

- “I don’t know, Guy.” Her strok- 
ing hand drew quickly back as if 
she shared his dread. “I’m afraid to 
guess.” 

Strangely, as it seemed to me, 
each long period of dream-ridden 
sleep left Guy more like Nick. He 
spoke faster, used longer words 
and displayed a better brain. 
Sometimes I thought I heard 
Nick’s intonations in his voice. 
As he lost weight — for he had all 
but ceased to eat — I sometimes 
thought I caught subtle hints of 
Nick in the way he looked and 
moved. 

Though I never quite under- 
stood Kyrie’s philosophy, she 
had come to accept Nick’s death 
with what looked like a quiet fa- 
talism. She no longer hated 
Guy — I wasn’t sure just how she 
felt. Remarkably serene, she of- 
ten ignored the rest of us and all 
the hazards of the road while she 
sat for hours with the tetrahe- 
dron in her golden hands, great 
eyes lost in its luminous hollow. 

“Why fret so?” she asked me 
once. “I don’t understand what’s 
happening to poof Guy. I’m not 
sure we’ll be able to reach the ter- 
minal or that we can light the ter- 



156 



GALAXY 




minal even if we do get there. But 
we’re trying. 

Sometimes she was happy 
enough for childish play. Once she 
tried to teach me a numerical 
game Nick had invented. Though 
I was never able to master the 
rules, it seemed to involve a race 
between the players to find large 
prime numbers that would com- 
plete certain intricate symmet- 
rical sequences. 

“Sorry, Uncle Kim.” She smiled 
affectionately when I gave up in 
disgust. “I had forgotten how 
much you hate to think.” 

She began to pass the time as she 
did long ago with her incompre- 
hensible music, blown and beat- 
en out of an odd set of instru- 
ments she had picked up along the 
way. Now the helmet of a dead 
militiaman made a melancholy 
drum. Empty cartridge cases and 
beer cans became sad pipes. A 
thin scrap of bullet-punctured 
armor vibrated in her deft brown 
hands, moaning and howling and 
wailing. 

I never learned to like her mu- 
sic, though it sent Guy into twitch- 
ing and whimpering ecstasy. But 
I could never forget it, either. Its 
eerie sweetness and its painful 
dissonance and its ungraspable 
scales are still alive, throbbing in 
some dim corner of my mind. And 
they come back to burn my eyes 
with tears when I think of Kyrie. 

Somewhere we had crossed an 
unmarked frontier out of the re- 



gion where scattered militia 
forces still tried to guard the refu- 
gees from the rising fog and their 
lawless fellow men. We had come 
into the higher, dryer western 
uplands stripped of metal by the 
ants, abandoned by mankind and 
as yet penetrated only here and 
there by probing tongues of fog. 

This was the region where the 
pilot, Clayton Carter, had near- 
ly died in his flight from the ants, 
but rains had come since his or- 
deal. We found water in the 
prairie lakes. Without human 
marauders in our way we made 
good time. I had nearly forgot- 
ten the snakes until a bright au- 
tumn afternoon brought us into 
view of the mountains of central 
New Mexico. Though the up- 
lands were still blue and far, I knew 
the snakes were nesting there and 
suddenly I was cold and giddy 
again with recollection of that 
disaster when the passing snake 
brought our plane down into the 
hailstorm. 

Guy was asleep in the back of the 
coach. 1 wanted to stop until he 
awoke, but Kyrie had recognized 
the mountains and she was anx- 
ious to press on for at least a 
glimpse of the terminal tower be- 
fore we camped. Tom agreed with 
Kyrie that our motor probably 
ran too cool to attract the snakes 
so we went on. 

G APS in the pavement delayed 
us. At sunset Tom gave the 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



157 




wheel to me and went to sleep in 
the back with Guy. Kyrie sat si- 
lent beside me, the glowing pyra- 
mid cradled in her hands, her anx- 
ious eyes on the dusky horizon. 
We crept on by the faint gray 
light of the low crescent moon. 

Here the ants had leveled every- 
thing. With no road signs, we were 
pretty well lost. But the moon 
guided us west and I could tell from 
the pull of the motor that we were 
climbing steadily. At each new 
crest I felt something of Kyrie’s 
eagerness to see the tower. 

Yet the strain of driving tired 
me. As each moonlit summit re- 
vealed nothing more exciting 
than a higher one ahead I began 
to feel a desolate sense of isola- 
tion. Kyrie became an untouch- 
able stranger. The nexode was a 
riddle I could never hope to solve. 
The transgalactic culture was a 
fantastic myth that didn’t really 
matter. The loneliness of the arid 
and abandoned landscape crept 
into me until I could almost feel 
myself becoming the last man 
alive. 

“Uncle Kim!” Kyrie caught my 
arm and I almost recoiled from 
her. “There it is!” 

I saw the terminal through a 
break in the hills to our left, its 
vastness diminished with dis- 
tance. Though we had been driv- 
ing a long time in the dark, the sun 
still struck its upper stages, out- 
lining them in purple and splen- 
did gold. 



“Tomorrow — ” her voice rang 
with joy — “we’ll be there.” Next I 
heard her breath catch and sudden 
trouble in her tone. “What’s that 
shadow? Did you see it. Uncle 
Kim?” 

The dead beacon was the high- 
est point of the tower, its dark 
onion dome hard to make out 
against the night sky. What I saw 
was an odd veil of darkness slip- 
ping down from the black beacon, 
dimming and blurring the upper 
stages of the terminal. 

“It’s probably just the twilight,” 
I said. 

“No.” Her voice was sharp with 
fear. “The shadow of the Earth 
rises from the foot of the tower. 
That darkness is crawling down 
from the top. It must be some- 
thing else.” 

She glanced at the pyramid in 
her hands and 1 felt her shiver. 

“I think it’s the snakes,” she 
whispered sharply. “They must 
be nesting on the tower. After all, 
it rises almost into empty space, 
where they feel at home. I’m afraid 
we’re going to have trouble.” 

That trouble came sooner than I 
had expected. The terminal tow- 
er dropped for a time below the 
moonlit hills as we drove on. The 
rose-and-purple of twilight had 
risen higher when we saw it again 
and the stranger darkness of the 
snakes had crept lower from the 
beacon dome, Filming the whole 
tower with a ghostly unreality. 
I was trying without success to 



158 



GALAXY 




imagine a tachyon ship landing 
on its fading stages when a snake 
buzzed us. 

Acrid bitterness flashed across 
my tongue. A chilling numbness 
brushed me. The headlamps went 
out. I had the briefest glimpse of 
its serpentine shadow dipping and 
lifting against the moon-washed 
sky. It was gone before I heard 
its sonic crash. 

I T LEFT us stalled on the road. 

Tom awoke, grumbling Yid- 
dish that I couldn’t understand. 
We lifted the hood and struck 
matches. Though nothing else was 
visibly damaged, all the batteries 
were drained. Even our flashlights 
were dead. We failed to start the 
motor. 

Dead tired and still shivering 
with that bone-deep chill, I wanted 
to make camp. But we were near 
the summit, Kyrie said — so high 
the snakes might descend on us 
again. She shook Guy awake and 
we pushed the hearse a mile or 
more over the highest crest. 

That far-off phantom tower had 
dissolved into the dark by then, 
but we pressed on down the wind- 
ing canyon road toward the val- 
ley of the Rio Grande and the 
ruins of Albuquerque. Guy was 
asleep again, groaning and twitch- 
ing as if pushing the hearse had 
been too much for him. Coasting 
now, we rolled down through the 
moonlight in a ghostly silence that 
set me to shivering with a sense 



that we had become inhuman 
company on an unearthly errand. 

“We’ll be safer in the valley.” 
Even Kyrie’s soft whisper startled 
me. “We can surely start the mo- 
tor when it’s light enough to see. 
Can’t we, Uncle Kim? I hope we 
reach Skygate tomorrow.” 

The night was thicker in the 
canyon, but I knew the road from 
driving it on winter holidays in 
that long-ago world, now strange- 
ly unreal, when a few of us used to 
ski on the high Sandia slopes. Suzie 
had come once, though not exact- 
ly with me. I got to thinking of 
her, wondering what had hap- 
pened to her since I left Skygate 
and whether Thorsen had sur- 
vived his space infection. The 
need for sleep forgotten, 1 drove 
on in a kind of waking dream. 

Two or three times, where the 
grade was too flat, we had to wake 
Tom to help us push again, but the 
thin cold moon was still high when 
we came out of the canyon into 
view of the mesa and the valley. 

Steering by the gray edge of the 
pavement, searching the dark for 
washouts or rocks on the road, I 
wasn’t looking far ahead. I felt 
Kyrie stiffen and shiver, heard 
her gasp of dismay. Braking to an 
instinctive stop, I saw the fog. 

A flood of luminescent white, 
nearly as bright as the bitten 
moon, it drowned the dead city. It 
filled the wide valley from the 
mounded ruins just below us to the 
line of lifeless volcanoes on the 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



159 




horizon. It reached north and 
south as far as I could see. 

Though I could feel no wind, the 
mist was stirring strangely, ris- 
ing and falling in soundless waves 
that broke against the rocks and 
the dark rubble islands, shatter- 
ing into ghostly dissipating 
plumes. 

“No!” Kyrie sobbed. “No!” 

But it was there, too deep for the 
morning sun to break it up, too 
wide for anything to bridge, 
spread too far to leave us a way 
around it. For a long time we sim- 
ply sat there in the dead hearse. 
There was nothing else to do. 

I fastened my jacket and shiv- 
ered in it, as the chill of the desert 
night followed the heat-drain of 
the snake, but Kyrie seemed to feel 
no cold. A remote white goddess 
in the dying light, she gazed some- 
times at the useless glow of the tet- 
rahedron in her hands, more of- 
ten at that wild but silent sea 
ahead. My throat ached with a dull 
regret for the failure of our mis- 
sion and a sharper pity for her. 

A breath of wind must have ris- 
en, because the odor of the fog 
rolled over us in a sudden, suffo- 
cating wave, rank as the stink of a 
jungle swamp, fetid as a sewer, 
its muskmelon sweetness blended 
with an overpowering foulness. 
Though Kyrie seemed uncon- 
scious of it, I felt nauseated. 

“Let’s get out,” I urged her. “I 
guess we can’t move the hearse, 
but we ought to make camp before 



the moon goes down. Somewhere 
higher — we passed a good spot in 
the canyon. The fog may rise in 
the dark.” 

She nodded dully, as if noth- 
ing mattered now. I set the brakes 
and clambered out of the hearse. I 
was dancing a slow shuffle on the 
pavement, trying to bring my stif- 
fened limbs to life, when she 
screamed. 

Her outcry was wordless, ago- 
nized, desolate. When I called to 
know what the matter was her on- 
ly answer was a thin moan of pain. 
I struck a match and found her 
kneeling over Guy in the back of 
the hearse. 

“He’s dead,” she sobbed then. 
“Guy’s dead — ” 

XXIII 

T OM groaned and awoke. We 
all crowded into the back of 
the hearse to examine Guy by the 
feeble flare of matches. He lay 
inert and swollen, with no breath 
or pulse. Kyrie splashed water on 
him, rubbed and flexed his furry 
limbs, tried to breathe into his 
mouth. Nothing revived him. 
Working over him, I began to 
catch an odor of dissolution 
ranker than his barnyard scent, 
stronger than the fetor of the fog. 

Retreating from that smell of 
death, I climbed out of the hearse 
and saw the fog again. It glowed 
with its own cold light, though the 
moon had set. Rising silently, it 



160 



GALAXY 




had already drowned those black 
rubble islets. A wide tongue of it 
had licked into the canyon, was 
lapping at the pavement not a 
hundred yards below the hearse. 

I shouted a warning. Tom 
scrambled out to join me, but 
Kyrie refused to leave Guy. He 
was too heavy for us to carry, but 
she stayed in the hearse, hauling 
vainly at him until Tom assumed 
our father’s thick accent to tell her 
a peasant tale about a goat boy 
who was eaten by a wolf because 
he wouldn’t leave his millet por- 
ridge. 

“1 suppose we ought to save our 
lives,” she whispered huskily 
then. “Though I see no good that 
we can do alone.” We were wait- 
ing to help her from the hearse, but 
she flung herself wildly back upon 
the corpse. “Oh, Guy! Guy!” 

She lay sobbing on his body till 
a long foul tongue of fog licked in- 
to the ditch beside us, drowning 
us with its nauseating miasma. 
Silently then, Kyrie let us lead her 
up the canyon road. 

As we started away from the 
hearse my foot struck something 
that made a jangling clatter. I 
picked up the object. In the pale 
glow of the tetrahedron, which 
Kyrie clutched in both stiff hands, I 
saw the glint of a hexagonal head 
and the gleam of wire-like limbs. 

It was a dead mechanical ant, 
one of a swarm that lay in a glit- 
tering drift along the edge of the 
pavement, where it must have fall- 



en when Nick was killed. I held it 
out to Kyrie, I suppose with some 
fantastic hope that she might re- 
vive it. She looked at me bleakly 
and I tossed it back into the dark. 

Dull with despair, silent as the 
fog itself, we climbed back into 
the canyon. The pyramid gave 
enough light to help us follow the 
pavement. Tom and I had brought 
blankets and canteens and our 
small stock of food. Plodding stol- 
idly, breath wheezing, he smoked 
his last narcorette. 

I stopped to look back once. 
That wild white sea was tossing as 
if an unseen storm raged beneath 
it. The rocks around the canyon 
mouth broke it into soundless 
spray. I shuddered and heard Tom 
muttering a Yiddish prayer. We 
stumbled after Kyrie. 

We made a cold and cheerless 
camp a mile from the fog, in a shal- 
low cave above the road that refu- 
gees from Albuquerque must 
have dug. I found a few sticks of 
wood stacked beside a fire circle 
stone, but Kyrie was afraid a 
flame might draw the snakes. A 
dull hunger was gnawing at my 
belly, but we had to save our food. 
I washed my mouth with one sip of 
water and crawled into my blan- 
ket. 

T OM was soon snoring, but Ky- 
rie didn’t sleep. Immune to 
cold, she sat cross-legged at the 
mouth of the cave, the luminous 
pyramid cupped in her hands. 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



161 




her sad eyes watching the way we 
had come. Her stricken desola- 
tion shook me. 

Bare to the glow of that great 
stone, her lean body was infinite- 
ly inviting, yet it stirred in me on- 
ly a cold ghost of ardor. Desire it- 
self was dying in the shattered 
world around us. What I felt was 
an infinite pity, an almost ma- 
ternal urge to comfort her, to 
break her black despair. I re- 
membered all the childhood years 
when she had been almost a 
daughter, with a child's frank af- 
fection for her fond Uncle Kim. 
But ' in this doleful moment I 
could not even speak to her. 

At last I slept, though 1 had 
meant to share her vigil. I awoke 
numb with cold. The cave was 
dark. The glow of the nexode was 
gone. Tom’s snores had ceased. I 
whispered and fumbled and found 
nobody. 

Shaking with terror. I stum- 
bled barefoot out of the cave. See- 
ing the high blaze of Orion, I knew 
that midnight was long past. The 
starlit road looked empty. When 
I called the only answer was a 
whispery echo from a distant 
cliff. 

My toes struck a rock as I blun- 
dered toward the pavement. The 
flash of pain cooled my first panic. 
I limped back to the cave for my 
shoes and then crept down the road 
to search for Tom and Kyrie. 

1 failed to find them. The odor of 
the fog stopped me above the can- 



yon mouth, a wall of unbreath- 
able evil. I climbed a rock to look 
for the hearse. That insane white 
tide was breaking over it now, so 
that it appeared and vanished 
again beneath the writing tongues 
of luminiscent mist. 

A funeral calm crept over me 
as I stood there. I gave up my use- 
less shouting and wandered back 
at last to the cave. Trembling 
more from dread than cold, I slip- 
ped again into my blanket and 
waited aimlessly for day. 

In my haunted thoughts Tom 
and Kyrie had died in some new 
effort to rescue Guy’s body. 1 
could visualize the fog flooding 
all the world, squeezing out the 
last human zone as it rose to meet 
the high dominion of the snakes. 
Perhaps I was already the last 
man alive. 

Oddly, my own fate did not 
matter now. Existence had be- 
come an emotionless abstrac- 
tion. As I looked back into the 
past from that comfortless cave, 
my life revealed itself as a mean- 
ingless monotony of shabby 
failure and deadening frustra- 
tion. I had been a lonely specta- 
tor, silently watching the rich 
feast of being that I could never 
fully join. 

1 recalled my old, unwilling 
envy of Tom, who had always 
seized the good things 1 somehow 
could never reach. My opposite, 
always the bold actor, never the 
timid or self-denying or self-right- 



162 



GALAXY 




eous onlooker, had lived what 
seemed a more rewarding life 
than mine. Perhaps our father 
had_ been right. Perhaps 1 really 
was the schlemiel. 

Exhausted by such profitless 
reflections, I fell into a troubled 
sleep. I recall a dream in which 
Tom and I were skiing down the 
highest Sandia slope. 1 was stiff 
and clumsy with the bitter cold. 
Tom swept far ahead and I envied 
his bold skill at the jump. Unsure 
of myself, I was afraid I couldn’t 
make the turn. 1 thought I was go- 
ing over the rim, into the black, 
pine-fringed canyon below it. 

But a girl’s warm voice called 
my name. At first I thought it was 
Suzie, but it was Kyrie I saw when 
1 looked back, nude and splendid, 
somehow flying over the snow 
with no skis at all. She overtook 
me and reached to grasp my hand. 
I knew we could make the turn to- 
gether. 

Something woke me then and 
the shock of stark reality shat- 
tered the joy of that improbable 
dream. No voice had called my 
name. A gray ray of dawnlight 
stabbed into the cave, but it 
brought no warmth. I was numb 
with cold and utterly alone. 

T OO numb at first to stand or 
think, I crept out into the heat- 
less sun. 1 sat for a while on a rock 
outside the cave, kneading my 
stiff muscles. When I fell able I 
drank a careful third of the water 



left in my canteen and shuffled, 
down the road to look for Tom and 
Kyrie. 

Where the canyon widened 1 
could see the upper stages of the 
tachyon terminal rising out of 
pink mushroom fields of far-off 
cumulus into the cloudless strato- 
sphere, still wavering and fading 
like a high mirage beneath the 
shadow of the nesting snakes. 

The pavement lay empty 
ahead, with no trace of Tom or 
Kyrie until I came out of the can- 
yon on the shore of the fog. Its 
heaving surface seemed calmer 
by day, dissolving into crawling 
blueish tatters as its tiny live bal- 
loons exploded in the sun, but its 
putrid fetor turned me ill. 

It had receded enough to un- 
cover our abandoned hearse, 
its tongues still licked around the 
wheels. Beneath those fading 
wisps of mist, I saw patches of wet, 
blood-colored slime on the pave- 
ment and on the rocks where the 
fog had lain. 

Reeling and retching from that 
rotten sweetness, I improvised a 
mask from a handkerchief satur- 
ated with the last water in my can- 
teen and plunged through those 
writhing tendrils to reach the 
hearse. 

Guy's body was gone. For a mo- 
ment I thought Tom and Kyrie 
must have come back to carry it 
away. Then I saw blood puddled 
on the floor, seeping from a 
mound of putrefying fur. Glass- 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



163 




black claws gleamed on the fin- 
gers of a queer glove peeled from 
a gray-furred paw. I reached gin- 
gerly to move a dark-tipped ear 
and spilled loose fangs that clat- 
tered like gravel. 

Shrinking back, numb with 
shock, I thought the body had been 
butchered by the unseen crea- 
tures of the fog. I searched the 
pavement, alert for any other evi- 
dence, for any sign of Tom or 
Kyrie, and found another puzzle. 

Gouts of red had splashed the 
pavement behind the hearse. At 
first I thought the receding fog 
had left them there, but then I saw 
that the glistening patches of 
blood-colored slime had not come 
so high. The gouts were Guy’s 
blood, marking a trail where his 
flesh had been dragged. 

The odd thing was the direction 
of that darkening trail. It led me 
off the pavement, across a rocky 
ditch scattered with the dead 
metal ants and up a steep slope 
away from the road and the slime 
and the fog. 

Scrambling up that slope, I dis- 
covered Tom and Kyrie in a scene 
that stunned me. The mechanical 
ants lay dead in glittering wind- 
rows of silver-and-black around 
the edges of a great disk of white 
stone. Kyrie sat cross-legged on 
one side of the stone, her golden 
nudity splotched with blood. Tom 
stood at the other, bare to the waist 
and scarlet as a pirate. Between 
them lay the red body they them- 



selves must have skinned out of 
Guy’s fur. 

I caught my breath to call out, 
but something stopped me. My 
wonder and horror were com- 
pounded with a sudden sense of 
awe. The shining, snow-white stone 
was like an altar. Kyrie was the 
mad priestess, Tom the sacrificial 
priest. The bleeding offering be- 
tween them must have been Guy's 
corpse. 

Shaken, I crouched behind a 
shelving stone to watch what went 
on. The skinned head lay in Kyrie’s 
lap. She held the blazing nexode 
against its forehead. Standing 
over the dark-clotted feet, Tom 
was chanting ritual words I didn’t 
understand. In response to the 
chant, Kyrie's red fingers flashed 
about the nexode, touching its 
bright triangles as if they had been 
the controls of some mysterious 
machine. 

1 crouched there a long time. 
Ants crawled on me — the live 
desert insects. Afraid they might 
sting, I was more afraid to move. 
From Tom's voice and Kyrie’s 
action I began to catch a sense of 
urgent tension, a grave purpose 
and a growing fear of failure. 

Tom’s chant abruptly stopped. 
Kyrie froze, staring at him across 
the tetrahedron. In the silence I 
heard the lazy drone of a big blue 
fly and saw it settling on that stiff 
red face. A red hand brushed at 
it — and 1 gasped with astonish- 
ment. 



164 



GALAXY 




T HE body was alive. A stranger 
discovery — what 1 saw beneath 
the blood was not naked muscle 
and tendon but intact skin. 1 
realized that this was not the hide- 
ous flayed thing that I had been 
imagining, but somehow a whole 
man. His hand reached for the 
nexode. Moving with an easy 
grace, he sat up on the spattered 
stone. 

“Hi, Ky!” 

“Nick!” Her breathless cry was 
a sob of mingled agony and joy. 
“Nicky!” 

Something close to terror shook 
me, because the voice was 
Nick’s — perhaps a little deeper 
than I recalled it. The blood- 
bathed man was Nick — or at least 
an excellent copy, perhaps a bit 
heavier and taller. Frowning a lit- 
tle against the sun, he looked 
around and saw Tom. 

“Hello, Hood.” 

“Gevalt!" Tom stumbled back- 
ward. His fat hands flew up de- 
fensively. For once in his life he 
was ruled by pure emotion, by 
terror at his own handiwork. 
“What — what sort of thing are 
you?” His gazing eyes appealed to 
Kyrie. “What have we done?” 
“We’ve beaten death,” Kyrie 
whispered. 

“What is all this?” Nick came to 
his feet with the agile grace I re- 
membered, peering down at the 
blood-smeared stone, off at the 
crawling fog, back at Kyrie. 
“Where’s Uncle Kim?” 



I caught my breath, but found 
that I could not announce myself. 

I was still too deeply shaken, 
paralyzed with bewilderment and 
dread. 

“Asleep in the cave,” Kyrie was 
saying. “Poor little man. I’m 
afraid he hasn’t entirely got over 
his gamma-form infection. I 
couldn’t bear to disturb him.” 

“Fet him sleep.” Nick turned as 
if to step off the gleaming disk, 
paused to frown at the glistening 
piles of lifeless ants around it, 
came slowly back to Kyrie. 
“We’ve problems enough of our 
own.” 

“But we’re all right now.” Her 
soft voice was almost too quick 
and eager, as if she could hardly 
believe her own words. “We can 
solve them, Nicky, now that you’re 
alive!” 

He stood staring across the tat- 
tered sea of fog toward the far 
white billows of cumulus and the 
dim mirage of the terminal tower 
rippling in the sky. 

“The most singular thing.” He 
glanced at the bright pyramid in 
his hands and back at Kyrie’s tense 
face. “Stranger than all of this.” 
Anxiously he stepped a little to- 
ward her. “I’ve been dreaming. 
Dreaming I was Guy. I even 
thought I’d killed Nick — ” 

His voice broke off sharply. He 
leaned to peer at Kyrie’s hands, 
swung to frown at the dark-stain- 
ed knife stuck in Tom’s belt, sud- 
denly looked down at himself, 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



165 




rubbing in a startled way at his 
own blood-stiffened skin. 

“So 1 was Guy!” Nodding in a 
dazed way, he looked back at 
Kyrie. “But I’ve been-»-he’s been 
— changing?” Slow at first, his 
breathless voice came faster and 
faster as he spoke. “The nexode 
did it, I suppose. The nexode and 
the nonhuman side of our own 
nature. I must be- a metamorph! 
Like that red bubble of beta-life 
in my mother's laboratory bottle. 
All Guy's illness that sleepiness 
and pain we couldn’t understand 
- that must have been the begin- 
ning of the process. And now I've 
been born again. Out of his skin. 
With you and Hood for mid- 
wives."’ 

“Oh, Nicky!” Kyrie was shiv- 
ering, her voice so low that I 
could scarcely hear. “It’s true Guy 
killed you back at Fairfax. Last 
night when the fog stopped us here 
I thought he — you — were dead. I 
thought we were done for, our lives 
wasted and the terminal lost". I 
can’t quite believe — ” 

“I never expected anything like 
this.” Nick was turning and flex- 
ing his hand, eyeing it with the 
dazzled wonder of a child un- 
wrapping some fabulous toy. “I 
never hoped - -” He stopped to nod. 
“But I suppose our experience 
here on only one planet was too 
limited to show us the full capacity 
of life.” He looked at Kyrie. 
“How did you do it?” 

“You did it, Nicky. Though I 



suppose the nexode helped. Last 
night in the cave — it showed me 
that you were alive in Guy’s dead 
skin. It showed me what we had to 
do and I woke Tom to help. But 
with time enough— if there had 
been no danger from the fog - I 
think you might have done every- 
thing yourself.” 

“You’re too good, Ky.” He was 
fondly teasing for an instant, be- 
fore his grave eyes lifted back to 
the shadow-mantled terminal. 
“But we still have work to do. 
There’s our beacon, dead.” 

“A roosting place for the 
snakes.” 

He frowned at the lifeless ants 
piled around the white stone. “Our 
replicators are also dead.” 

“They stopped when you died.” 

“Then they ought to start 
again.” 

Hesitantly, trembling, she pick- 
ed up a small, still machine and 
held it before him. He thrust a red 
forefinger toward its silver head. 
Though no spark passed, the bright 
device came alive, stirred in her 
hands, rose to wheel around Nick’s 
head. 

I heard a high mosquito-whine, 
which spread all around me. The 
dead ants below the stone began 
rising from the ground by twos and 
threes, by scores, by hundreds. 
They flew to join a circling swarm, 
which settled toward the end of the 
stone. I smelled hot sulphur. 

“Ai-yi-yi!” Tom cowered back. 
“All this is too much.”

“It’s okay, Mr. Hood,” Kyrie 
called to him. “The replicators 
are no space invaders. They are 
ours.” 

The spinning swarm poured 
down toward the stone. Though I 
saw no gesture of command, the 
ants began joining together, 
limbs interweaving, silver heads 
joining to form honeycomb 
panels which flexed and fused into 
a hollow ten-foot globe, a black 
gangway rising to its open door. 

“Perhaps we weren’t born for 
nothing.” Nick waved Tom and 
Kyrie toward the ramp. “Let’s get 
the nexode to the terminal. If the 
snakes don’t object too much I 
think we can light the beacon after 
all.” 

“Nicky! Nicky!” Kyrie whis- 
pered. “If we can!” 

She skipped up the ramp with 
the tetrahedron, but Tom hung 
back, scowling at its surface of 
slick black tail-balls as if he ex- 
pected them to sting him. 

“Will the ants do anything you 
want?” He squinted shrewdly at 
Nick, loud and bold again, almost 
himself. “Could you make them 
find me a pack of narcorettes?” he 
asked. 

“Come along," Nick said. “I 
want to pick up Uncle Kim.” 

“My yukl brother" Tom 
shrugged. “Why waste time on that 
poor shmuck? Better leave him 
where he is. He’s no utopian. He’ll 
never be happy in our new 
world.” 



S TUNG to anger I stood up to 
challenge Tom. Kyrie was call- 
ing from inside the bright globe, I 
think defending me. Nick took 
Tom’s fat arm, swung him firmly 
toward the black ramp. I tried to 
shout, but something caught my 
voice. 

Something made me giddy. 
Something brushed me with icy 
sweat. Something left me drained 
and swaying. I sank back behind 
the shelving rock, sick with a 
puzzled rage at myself. 

Though I never knew exactly 
what had seized me, there was the 
blackness inside the hollow globe. 
There was the piercing stridor of 
the ants that formed it — and their 
steamy, acrid reek. There was 
Tom’s cautious shrewdness as he 
tested the black ramp and his bold 
swagger when he climbed it. 

Then there was Nick, red with 
alien blood, newborn from Guy’s 
hide, gazing impatiently across the 
heaving tide of fog toward that 
bank of far cloud and the snake- 
veiled stages of the tachyon termi- 
nal. Though I had known the chil- 
dren all their lives, Nick was a 
frightening stranger now. 

Sobbing miserably, bewildered 
at myself, I began to feel a barb of 
piercing truth in Tom’s scornful 
words. I had known and loved the 
children as fascinating visitors to 
my own familiar world, but this 
world was theirs. I feld a sudden 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



167 




sick conviction that it was not for- 
me. 

My world had been the narrow 
ghetto flat where the heat was often 
off and cockroaches swarmed 
under the sink and the toilet over- 
flowed. It had been the petty 
bickering of my parents, my 
father’s ugly business and my 
mother’s ugly death. It had been 
Tom’s scheming climb and my 
own half-honest career in promo- 
tion and publicity. I was what that 
gray and painful world had made 
me— a schlemiel , perhaps as my 
father used to say. Looking at my- 
self in this cold light, I could see 
no useful place for me in the new 
world beyond the fog, in that daz- 
zling future the children were 
about to usher through the tach- 
yon terminal. 

I lay silent in the grip of a sick 
paralysis as Nick followed Tom in- 
to the silver globe. The ramp rolled 
up to seal the dark opening. 
Sweating and trembling, un- 
certain of what I wanted or what to 
do, I watched the bright ball sail up 
the canyon toward the cave. It 
dropped beyond the cliffs. Nick or 
Kyrie must have left it to search the 
cave for me. A few minutes later it 
rose again, a diminishing moon 
gliding high above the fog toward 
that far tower. 

Calmer after it was gone, I be- 
gan to feel a remote sense of hope 
and joy. Whatever became of me, 
Nick and Kyrie were moving 
toward their cosmic triumph. 



After sixty million years on the 
barren moon the black seed from 
the messenger missile was about 
to bear its destined fruit. 

Impelled by an aimless curiosity, 

I climbed to that reddened altar 
stone. Its top was circular and flat, 
twenty feet across. White and 
dense, slick and oddly warm to the 
touch, it was hard enough to break 
the point of my pocket knife. Be- 
fore I had solved its riddle, a new 
swarm of ants funneled down 
upon me. 

Frightened and bewildered, I 
stumbled out of their way. They 
rattled on the stone like metal hail 
and began to knit themselves in- 
to a silver shell around it. The sun 
flickered and my tongue turned bit- 
ter. Their shrieking whine drilled 
into my brain. Staggering back, I 
watched them rising with the 
stone. 

Its shape astonished me. No 
disk, it was a cone — the capstone, 
1 believe, shaped to complete the 
onion dome of the tachyon 
beacon. Dropped by the ants when 
Nick was killed, it had fallen point 
down, penetrating to leave its base 
nearly level with the rock it shat- 
tered. Extracted, it left a yawning 
pit. 

Blind to me, the ants soared 
away with it. Their shriek died, and 
their brimstone scent dissolved in 
the stagnant stench of the fog. The 
sun turned hot and bright again. I 
tossed a pebble into the pit and 
wandered back to the road. 



168 



GALAXY 




I PLODDED up the canyon 
through a mist of gray regret, 
thinking wistfully of Guy's 
abandoned kingdom and the 
warm refuge from all the terrors 
of space I had once found there. 
My dull wonder about the fate of 
Billie Fran and Andy Elving and 
our green-gartered guards became 
a sudden decision. I would go back 
to Fairfax. 

The short climb had left me al- 
ready puffing for breath and look- 
ing for a place to sit. My purpose 
wavered a little when I realized my 
weakness and remembered the 
cruel ordeal Clayton Carter had 
endured in his epic retreat from 
the ants. But as a fugitive from the 
terminal and the children’s new 
world 1 had nowhere else to go. 

The journey might be easier for 
me than Carter had found it. I 
should find water enough after the 
autumn rains. With luck, I might 
find food plants maturing on 
abandoned farms and game or cat- 
tle that I could kill. By afternoon I 
was almost cheerful, whistling as 
I cleaned the deer rifle, sunned the 
blankets, filled the canteens from 
a spring I had found above the 
cave, repacked my slim provi- 
sions — already finding an emo- 
tional haven in the primitive sim- 
plicities of a roving hunter’s exis- 
tence. 

As 1 lay that night on my hard 
bed, waiting to start at dawn, 1 felt 
a curious detachment from every- 
thing, almost as if my life had al- 



ready closed. Looking back at my- 
self, with no emotion save a dull 
desire that things had been dif- 
ferent, I found myself weighing 
all my shabby failures. If I had 
really been a schlemiel , where was 
the blame? 

My flaw had been a failure to 
love, it seemed to me, due to a 
failure to understand. It was, I 
thought, a family fault. If my 
mother had ever learned to laugh at 
my father’s Yiddish jokes, if he 
had ever learned not to laugh at the 
ways of her Ozark kin, if Tom and 
I had really known each other . 

At last I slept, plagued by dread- 
ful dreams in which the scarlet, 
skinless monsters of the fog were 
stalking me to take my hide. I 
woke before dawn, aching all 
over, soaked with sweat and shiver- 
ing. Imagining that the gamma- 
life was teeming in my blood 
again, I lay staring drearily at the 
dark until I saw a blood-red glow 
on the back of the cave. 

At first I thought it must be an- 
other symptom of my space in- 
fection, distorting my senses and 
eroding my reason. I tried to lie 
still, but panic began to whisper 
that some new doom had come to 
consume the world. I crawled out 
of my wet blankets to find the 
source of the glow. 

The westward sky was turning 
strangely scarlet above the black 
canyon rim, as if a dying sun were 
rising in the wrong direction. I 
staggered out in bare feet and 



THE AAOON CHILDREN 



169 




went back to get my shoes. That 
red glare was bright enough to help 
me find them. 

Shaking with cold and dread, 1 
crept down the road to get a better 
view. The glow in the west grew 
brighter as I went. Slowly 
changing color, it had washed the 
stony cliffs with gold before 1 
came in sight of the tachyon 
terminal. 

A dazed comprehension stopped 
me there, my terror fading into 
awe. The light in the sky shone 
from the onion dome that topped 
the tallest tower — no doubt com- 
pleted now with that conic altar 
stone on which Nick had been re- 
born. Relieved, yet still appalled 
before all the unknowns of the 
transgalactic universe, I knew 
that Nick and Kyrie already had 
the beacon calling across the light- 
years to their mysterious progeni- 
tors. 

I stood there a long time, watch- 
ing the beacon change. The shroud 
of snakes was gone. Dazzling in the 
crystal air, the tower looked near 
enough to touch. The tall cone 
bathed the barren landscape in an 
eerie green, which faded slowly 
through midnight blue into a dy- 
ing violet dusk. I waited, shivering 
in the wind, until the red was born 
again. 

The actual tachyon signal was 
invisible of course, leaping across 
its own strange domain beyond the 
limited velocity of light. This 
visible signal must have been 



meant only to guide a, decelera- 
ting starship through its final 
homing approach to the landing 
stage. Even as 1 thought of that, the 
changing splendor of the beacon 
brushed me with a vain regret. 

I might have been part of all this. 
1 might have called out to Nick and 
Kyrie and followed them into 
their flying globe. I might have 
been with them in that wondrous 
tower now, waiting for their star- 
born creators. Instead . 

Whimpering and miserable, I 
stumbled back to the cave. As I lay 
there shivering through the rest of 
the night, staring at the changing 
glow on the smoke-stained rock, I 
decided to wait, to watch for the 
tachyon ship to come in. 

But as the gray dawn came a 
cold west wind drowned me in the 
fetid muskmelon-sweetness of the 
fog and suddenly 1 knew I 
couldn’t stay. I had no way of 
knowing when that tachyon 
signal might reach the unknown 
powers of the messenger mis- 
siles or whether it ever would. 
Even if the signal should bring a 
starship to earth, 1 had no way of 
guessing the time a tachyon flight 
might take. I did know that the 
handful of dried beef and parched 
corn left in my pack would keep me 
going for only a few days. 

Sick with the breath of the fog, I 
struggled stiffly into my gear and 
began the long climb out of the 
valley, toward the snake-haunted 
summit and the abandoned lands 



170 



GALAXY 




beyond. The rainbow glow of the 
beacon was still washing the cliffs 
above me with colors of wonder 
when I set out, but the gray day- 
light soon erased it. 

H ERE my recollections blur. 

Whether from starvation and 
exhaustion or from that recurrent 
gamma-form infection — or from 
sheer depth of hope — my aware- 
ness shattered into disconnected 
fragments. Sun, dust, rocks, frost, 
hail. Mountain wall and desert 
mirage. The blinding blaze of 
thirst, the crazy fever buzz in my 
head, the black laughter of des- 
pair. Days of slogging on when all 
I wanted was to lie down. Nights of 
paralyzing cold in cheerless camps 
where 1 was afraid to make a fire 
because I thought the snakes 
might come. 

Those cruel trials were real. 
They are tangled in my memory 
with stranger impressions in 
which hard reality seems to blend 
into fantastic dreams. I recall 
one moonless night when I lay on 
flat high ground, with not even a 
rock or a bush to break the icy 
wind. I couldn’t sleep. I was follow- 
ing the wheeling constellations, 
wondering dully what sort of crea- 
ture might come from the stars to 
answer the tachyon signal — if any- 
thing did — when 1 thought I saw a 
new star in the east. 

Or a planet, perhaps, for it didn’t 
twinkle. Yet, cobalt-blue, it was the 
wrong color for any planet, and it 



was soon too bright. Its color slow- 
ly changed, to an unbelievable 
green, to ocher and orange, to a 
redder red than Mars. It went out 
and winked back again, indigo- 
blue. 

Faster than any possible planet, 
it climbed toward the zenith. In the 
green and yellow phases its un- 
earthly light tinted the dead land- 
scape around me with a frosty, 
moonlike strangeness, so bright I 
trembled with an irrational ter- 
ror that the snakes might discover 
me. 

Sailing overhead, it swelled into 
a visible globe. I put down the mad 
urge to look for a hiding place and 
stood to watch it sinking toward 
the west. The cycle of its changing 
hues had begun accelerating and 
now I began to notice a sort of 
echo that must have come from the 
tachyon beacon. 

The terminal was below my hor- 
izon here, but I could see its re- 
mote glow against the sky, a red 
explosion as the red globe winked 
out, a race through the spectrum 
while the globe was dark, a blue 
dusk dying behind the black 
mountain ridge as the globe 
burned blue again. Always 
alternating, those cycles of light 
ran faster, faster, until the flicker 
hurt my eyes. Yet I watched until 
the globe had set like a flashing 
moon behind the far peaks and the 
night was abruptly black again. 

I don’t remember wondering 
what that luminous object couid 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



171 




have been or why the terminal had 
answered its flashes or where it 
might have fallen. Rolled in my 
blanket again, I lay numbly wait- 
ing for the snakes. I must have 
slept, for I remember thinking 
they had found me. Turned to rib- 
bons of raw red flesh, they stank 
with the suffocating foulness of 
the fog and sang to me in Kyrie’s 
voice while they licked my skin 
away. 

Again, in an endless nightmare 
that must have been at least partly 
real, I thought I saw the fog. 
Drenched and shivering from a 
thin fall rain, I had nerved myself 
to climb one last hill. In the valley 
beyond, instead of the firewood 
and shelter I longed for, I found a 
flood of heaving whiteness, in- 
visibly stirred from beneath and 
reaching as far as I could see. 

I slept under the road in a con- 
crete pipe, sweating through dread- 
ful dreams in which the fog had 
risen over me and trapped me in 
the pipe. 1 lay too weak to move or 
even breathe. When I crawled out 
at dawn that evil sea had somehow 
drained away, leaving its red slime 
to mark the level it had reached. 
My real dreams are still haunted 
with the figments of the strange 
daymare that followed, in which I 
was struggling to cross that fear- 
ful valley where the fog had lain. 

Sick with its lingering musk- 
melon fetor, 1 slipped and toppled 
and crept through the blood-col- 
ored muck. 1 saw animal bones 



coated with it. Once I heard a 
dreadful mewing sound and saw a 
quivering strip of naked redness 
trying to hide itself in a reddened 
human skull. 

The highway bridge at the bot- 
tom of the valley was missing. I 
was trying to cross the rocky gorge, 
splashing and staggering through 
a shallow river of that clotted 
slime, when I heard the shrilling of 
the ants and caught their sulphuric 
scent and saw a silver-colored ball 
dropping toward me. 

I tried to wave it away. When it 
came on I raised the deer rifle and 
fired. The only result was a flicker 
of darkness and a bitter tang on 
my tongue. The globe dropped to 
the brink of that red river. A long 
strip of honeycombed ants folded 
down to make a black-lined gang- 
way. 

K YRIE stepped out upon it. 

Dream or not — I was not cer- 
tain. Her nude beauty clashed 
against the horror of that red- 
walled valley in a way that dazed 
me. The daylight washed her 
marble flesh with swift pink and 
gold, as if she had been a stone 
Venus touched with instant life. 
Not quite sane, I brought up the 
rifle. 

“Get away!” I gasped. “I can’t 
endure anything else.” 

“Uncle Kim — ” Pain choked her 
gentle voice. “Don’t you know who 
1 am?” 

“You’re a space alien.” I listen- 



172 



GALAXY 




ed to my own hoarse voice with a 
dull astonishment. “You’re like 
the snakes. Like the things that 
make the fog. Like the gamma- 
forms in my blood. Like whatever 
creatures the beacon will bring 
from the stars — ” 

“But the ambassadors are al- 
ready here, Uncle Kim.” Her quick 
voice and her anxious dark-eyed 
smile tried hard to comfort me. 
“They arrived on the tachyon 
ship, but you don't need to fear 
them. They’ve come to bring the 
transgalactic culture. To help 
everybody. I think you need 
help — ” 

“No.” The rifle rose. “I’ve had 
enough from space — ” 

“The snakes are gone.” She 
glanced into the sky. “They never 
liked it here. Our air has too much 
water and oxygen for them. They 
prefer to meet visitors out in 
space — an the vicinity of Jupi- 
ter — where they feel more at 
home.” 

“But there’s the fog.” 1 waved 
the rifle at the red-slimed cliffs 
above us and the blood-colored 
river lapping at my knees. “The 
things from space that make the 
fog—” 

“We asked for them — ’’she 
tossed back her flowing 
hair — “when we invaded Venus. 
You remember the color changes 
our manned probes observed? They 
were caused by blights that spread 
from the garbage we dumped — 
spread somewhat faster than the 



gamma infections ever spread on 
Earth. Those blights killed half the 
aerobic life in the upper air of 
Venus. The more intelligent flying 
things down in the temperate mid- 
dle levels found their food supplies 
depleted. They struck back in self- 
defense. The fog covers a military 
expedition composed of special 
mutant creatures bred to survive 
in our biocosm and sent to stop us 
from polluting their planet. It was 
a force from Venus, by the way, 
that trapped our men on Mer- 
cury.” 

“If we — ” The simple truth stag- 
gered me. “If we had only under- 
stood — ” 

“That’s why the snakes were 
here.” Her urgent voice came 
faster, faster, in a way that made 
me think of Nick. “They’re well- 
meaning and more or less intelli- 
gent — though I don’t think they 
ever knew what they were doing to 
our aircraft. They were trying to 
communicate. The breakthrough 
came when they were able to ex- 
plain the situation to our trans- 
galactic friends. You should have 
seen the happy way they dived 
around the terminal when the 
Venusians began pulling back the 
fog.” 

“Why bother about the fog— ” 
bitterness croaked in my throat — 
“when the human race is dead? 
Why not just invite our space 
friends to take over the planet?” 

“Uncle Kim!” She made a face 
at me. “Things aren’t that bad. The 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



173 




Venusians were pretty humane, by 
our old military standards. They 
concentrated their forces around 
our space centers-^at Skygate and 
the Sino-Soviet installations in the 
Gobi. There was no mass 
slaughter. Though the snakes did 
stop air travel and the fog drove 
men off the sea, we've found most 
of the human race alive and w'ell, 
on dry land.” 

I stared down at my red-caked 
hands and blankly back at her. 

“So the world didn’t end.” Her 
rapid voice had slowed, and she 
had time for a quizzical smile. “If 
you can stand the shock! Our big 
job’s done and we’ve got a short 
vacation. The ambassadors are 
off to call on our neighbor planets. 
Your enterprising brother has in- 
vited my poor mother to try the 
new snow on the Sandia slopes. 
Nick is on his way to visit old 
friends at Fairfax- enough of Guy 
is left in him so that he had to see 
those women again. Won’t Billie 
Fran be surprised!” 

S HE laughed, shrugged. That 
careless gesture may have hid- 
den more feeling than she showed, 
but the liquid flow of her golden 
body nearly stopped my heart. 

“And I came out to look for you 
again, though everybody else had 
given you up.” Halfway down the 
black gangway she paused to 
study me. “About time, too. If you 
could see yourself — a perfect 
scarecrow!” 



She laughed at me. Wading to 
meet her, I stopped again, stung by 
her look of sheer delight. 

“Kim!” Concern erased her 
laughter. “What’s the matter?” 

“I’m just a man, for one thing.” 
My own sardonic voice surprised 
me. “I’m afraid I don’t belong on 
your bright new superhuman 
world.” I saw her hurt protest and 
raised my gritty voice. “For 
another thing, I believe my gam- 
ma-form infection has come 
back.” 

“Our new health service will 
soon cure that.” She left the ramp 
and picked her way across the slick 
red rocks to the brink of the blood- 
colored stream. Pausing there, 
golden hands on golden hips, she 
surveyed me from enigmatic eyes. 

“There’s a quicker treatment.” 
Her warm amusement was mixed 
with something else. “One we 
might both enjoy. You know I was 
born with a natural immunity to 
all sorts of infection. There’s a 
way I can use it to cure you— 
though your doctor might frown 
at the method.” 

Waiting to discover what she 
meant, I stood admiring her tawny 
loveliness. I felt my pulses throb- 
bing and wondered vaguely if her 
unearthly power had already be- 
gun to lift me out of my long ex- 
haustion. Fond recollections were 
dancing in my brain like cham- 
pagne bubbles — images of Ky- 
rie’s infant elfin charm, of her tiny 
hand trustingly in mine, of her

GALAXY 




secret delight in her own peculiar 
music, of her strange games with 
little Nick, of that magic moment 
when the touch of the nexode made 
her a woman. Now the sunlight 
gilded her breasts and thighs and I 
was shaken with a spasm of un- 
expected lust. Dismayed, sudden- 
ly conscious of my hungry stare, I 
tried to turn away. 

“You needn’t feel so damned in- 
cestuous!” Her ringing laugh 
mocked my confusion. “After all, 
you’re not my real uncle.’’ Her eyes 
turned grave and almost sad. 
“You see, Kim, the nexode showed 
me long ago how you felt about 
me. I think I’ve always under- 
stood you better than you under- 
stand yourself- -and loved you 
more than you dare love anybody. 
That's why I’ve come to find you.” 

Her impish look faded into a 
cool directness that took my 
breath. 

“That’s the reason for my only 
reservation now. I don’t want to 
hurt you more than you’ve been 

hurt. Whatever ” She paused as 

if to weigh me. “Whatever we do, 
1 hope you won’t let it matter too 
much.” 

1 waited in a daze. 

“First of all, there’s something I 
must tell you.” Her voice fell 
soberly. “Nick and I will be leav- 
ing on the tachyon ship. We’re to 
represent our whole group of 
planets. 1 don’t know when we’ll be 
back.” 

Her face reflected my pain.

“I’m sorry, Kim. I don’t like 
leaving you, my mother, or Uncle 
Yuri and Aunt Carolina. But it’s 
part of the job we were born to do, 
and we’re both excited about it. 
It’s another big mission, helping 
all our worlds adjust to the cul- 
ture of the stars.” 

I nodded bleakly as that sank in. 

“I thought you ought to know,” 
she said. “Because no other crea- 
ture can follow until certain 
problems of health and law have 
been cleared up. We’ll have to 
leave you here.” 

She came toward me through the 
clotted mud. I dropped the rifle. 

She kissed me — Kyrie kissed 
me. 

I followed her out of the mud. 
The shrilling of the ants was 
suddenly a joyous song. 

T HAT day and night are special 
in my memory, too precious for 
any bare description. Drunk with 
the wine of her lilac-like 
scent, wedded to all her golden 
wonder, for that tiny time I was 
more than merely mortal. 

Kyrie! Giving me that taste of 
superhuman joy, how could she 
have asked me not to let it matter? 
Her farewell left a desolate ache in 
my heart. Blind with tears, all I 
saw was a blur of blue when she 
opened the door of the globe. 

“The starship is loading on the 
top stage now.” Her voice was 
hurried and uneven. “The air up 
there is too thin for you. I’ll have to 



leave you here.” Her cool arms 
caught me in a last quick embrace. 
“Don’t forget me, Kim.” 

Had she ever been far from my 
mind? 

Looking out, I saw that the 
globe had brought me down to the 
middle of a vast white plain with 
only blue fog around it. A chill 
wind bit my nakedness. A forlorn 
desolation seized me and I turned 
back for a final glimpse of Kyrie. 

“You’ll be okay, Kim.” Her 
voice had the edge I needed. “After 
all, you're a big boy now. I know 
you’re well — and strong enough!” 

I heard the love beneath her 
impish malice and suddenly it 
struck me as a monstrous fault that 
I had never properly told her how 
I loved her. I tried to speak, then 
remembered that she knew all I 
felt. I waved and strode down the 
gangway. 

The blue glow had died and now 
the cloudy dawn revealed the 
distant loom of the central tower, 
lifting forever to that higher stage 
where the air was too rare for me. 
In a moment the beacon was burn- 
ing through the gray clouds 
again — a glow of rose, a shower of 
gold, a floodlight flowing over all 
the unearthly magnificence around 
me. I saw Yuri Marko and Caro- 
lina riding up a ramp to meet me, 
undismayed at being left behind, 
waving and grinning greenly as the 
beacon changed. With a certain 
reluctant eagerness, I stepped into 
the future I had fled. ir
