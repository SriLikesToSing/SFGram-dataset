NOTES FROM AN EDITOR'S PAD 



T>EADERS suffering from a 
touch of insomnia, especially 
if they don’t happen to live more 
than two or three states away 
from New York, may now and 
then hear a radio program called 
“The Party Line,” in which Long 
John Nebel and a panel of co- 
horts nightly plumb the problems 
of the world. In their time, they 
have looked into everything from 
the first-hand stories of men who 
claimed to be on friendly terms 
with flying-saucer people to the 
offstage opinions of show-biz folk. 

Not too long ago the subject 
was science fiction. The panel for 
the night included Lester del Rey 
(author of Nerves, The Wind Be- 
tween the Worlds and innumer- 
able other fine science-fiction 
stories), James Blish (author of 
A Case of Conscience, Surface 
Tension and, again, innumerable 
others) and Frederik Pohl (who, 
among other attributes, has lately 
been an occupant of Galaxy’s 
editorial masthead.) 

In five and a half hours (the 
program begins at midnight and 
ends somewhere around dawn), 
there is time to explore a subject 
pretty thoroughly. That night 
science fiction got about as inten- 



sive a going-over as it has had in 
public for some years. The ver- 
dict: Mixed, but hopeful. 

“The trouble with science fic- 
tion,” began Lester del Rey — 
striking a note that makes an in- 
teresting harmony with his story 
in this issue — “is that too much 
of the wonder has gone out of it. 
The wonder is still around us. 
Science still has exciting new 
things to write about. But to 
make them into stories requires 
thought — and too many writers 
just won’t give their stories that 
much thought.” 

But, the panel agreed, there are 
more troubles than that. And one 
of the troubles is that no two 
people seem to be able to agree 
just what a science-fiction story 
is in the first place, much less 
what is good and what is bad in 
science fiction. 

“Every good writer who comes 
to science fiction makes his own 
rules,” Jim Blish said. “There’s 
very little in common between, 
say, Ray Bradbury and Hal Cle- 
ment. The only definition I know 
that fits at least most of the cases 
is Theodore Sturgeon’s: ‘A science 
fiction story is a story like any 
other story except that, if you 



NOTES FROM AN EDITOR'S PAD 



5 



subtract the scientific element 
from it, there isn’t any story left 
at all. 

Naturally the panel at once be- 
gan listing stories which were ex- 
ceptions to even that rule . 
and so it went on, until the dawn. 

There was much more — five 
and a half hours more — includ- 
ing excursions into psionics (“Not 
a science,” ruled Blish and del 
Rey; “Well, maybe it might be, 
some day,” ventured Pohl), dia- 
netics, deros, fan feuds, conven- 
tion goings-on and . well . 
everything. 

The producer of the show tells 
us that it was taped and will prob- 
ably be replayed some time in the 
future. Maybe you’d enjoy sam- 
pling it when it is. 

M eanwhile, what about it? 

Is there a definition of science 
fiction that makes sense? And is 
it true that modern science gives 
writers countless opportunities to 
write fine science-fiction stories? 

Modern science probably gives 
just about everybody just about 
everything, since it operates in so 
many areas and on so many 
levels. The satellites and atomic- 
propelled submarines are “modern 
science.” So are the confusing flip- 
flop reversals that characterize so 
much of the theory behind the 
“life sciences.” (Neurosis is — 
isn’t — is caused by childhood 
shock, with no physical basis. 



Microbiological theory tells us 
how penicillin attacks germs, so 
we can chemic up a new penicillin 
that will kill penicillin-resistant 
staphylococcus — only the staph 
fools us by adopting a whole new 
metabolism that pretends penicil- 
lin doesn’t exist. Soil conservation 
techniques, warding against fire 
and like catasirophes, turn out 
merely to insure that when the 
catastrophe does come it is enor- 
mously more destructive . Say, 
is that an idea for a story? Is the 
universe really out to get us? ) 

On its higher, more abstruse 
levels, certainly there is much in 
modern science that is hardly 
known to the non-technical world, 
much less adopted by science- 
fiction writers for their stories. 
“Science,” says Dr. Edward Teller, 
“is constantly becoming more 
simple and more beautiful.” And 
certainly we are each year acquir- 
ing new insights into the gran- 
deurs of the basic laws of the 
universe; and certainly wonderful 
patterns and unexpected relation- 
ships begin to appear. 

But it’s at least a question 
whether the basic laws of the uni- 
verse are very useful to the sci- 
ence-fiction writer. And it’s hardly 
a question at all that the sputniks 
and Moon probes are no longer 
in themselves enough to build 
science fiction out of. (We can’t 
compete with the daily papers!) 
So between the here-and-now 



6 



GALAXY 



(rockets) and the far-out (the 
Dirac universe, Hoyle’s steady- 
state cosmology and, yes, psionics) 
there should be a middle ground, 
a world of scientific ideas neither 
too big nor too little to spark 
great science-fiction stories. 

We maintain that ground exists. 
Confound it, we maintain that 
Galaxy has pitched its tent on it 
for lo, these many years! 

HTHE here-and-now no longer 
has the “wonder” we seek. 
The all-embracing cosmic discov- 
ery is too remote. (Honorable 
exceptions? Sure! But how few?) 
Of smaller bits our lives are made, 
and it is stories that touch our 
own lives in some way that give 
us pleasure. 

We think that good science 
fiction occurs when the static nu- 
cleus (“writer”) absorbs the plod- 
ding neutron (“scientific idea”) 
and, willy-nilly, explodes into the 
searing hard radiation that illumi- 
nates our lives, inside and out — 
“good science-fiction story.” 

“Good” becomes “best” when 
the scientific idea is itself some- 
thing fresh and interesting, or 
when the writer has found some- 
thing new to say about it. It does 
not have to be something as big as 
a theory of the origin of the uni- 
verse. It can be: 

What would happen if we 
raised human beings in germ-free 
environments, as we now do with 



laboratory animals? (Allen Kim 
Lang’s World in a Bottle .) Or: 
Suppose non-material aliens at- 
tack and we have to fight them? 
(Daniel F. Galouye’s Fighting 
Spirit .) Or: What if evolution 
continues and the dog evolves to 
roughly human intelligence, the 
human to something beyond? 
(Damon Knight’s Auto-da-Fe.) 
Or: How would an alien, not 
malevolent, go about getting the 
things it needed from a human 
child? (Theodore Stugeon’s Tan- 
dy’s Story.) Or: What will it be 
like in the Sahara when at last we 
get around to reclaiming it as 
living space? (Mack Reynolds’s 
Farmer . ) 

These, you know, are stories 
that appeared right here in Gal- 
axy in the last few months! Every 
one of them was solidly built on 
a basis of scientific idea, every one 
of them was handsomely extrapo- 
lated and brilliantly detailed. 

Of course, there are more kinds 
of good science fiction than we 
have indicated here — as James 
Blish says, there’s a kind for every 
good writer. But there is the mid- 
dle ground where the “wonder” 
can be found. And it’s fertile soil! 

There’s nothing wrong with 
science fiction — nothing that 
good stories won’t cure; and we 
think we’ve got them for you! 

That’s our opinion — what’s 
yours?

THE 



GATEKEEPERS 






I 

A S the ships of two warring 
worlds fought savagely in 
space and in air over Bel- 
cron, Moka’s capital city, Hugh 
Hawkins paced anxiously up and 
down the vast, empty MT area. 
It wasn’t his own safety he was 
concerned about — the Singalese 
ships would be as careful as 
Moka’s own not to run any risk 
of damaging the Gate, and it was 

8 



for that reason that Hugh’s stand- 
ing orders were to take cover in 
the MT area at the first threat of 
an enemy raid. 

Although scores of people were 
dying every minute all around 
him, Hugh Hawkins, the Mokan 
Gatekeeper, had no choice but to 
stay under cover and take no 
part in defense duties or even 
rescue operations. Not for Hugh 
Hawkins the safest of space-raid 
duties. He was far too valuable. 

GALAXY 



Besides, he was technically neu- 
tral. 

Of course, it was always pos- 
sible in such a ferocious, chaotic 
battle that a stray shot would 
find him, or that a damaged ship 
would crash down on the huge 
enclosures which was generally 
known as the Gate. But if that 
happened, if the Gate itself was 
accidentally destroyed, Hugh 
Hawkins wouldn’t be valuable 
any more. 

THE GATEKEEPERS 



The equation of power was 
easily balanced: He had the key 
to victory in their struggle 
against another planet — 
they had his wife I

It was not, however, any such 
considerations that made Hugh 
so jumpy. It was the fact that 
Alice was out in the middle of 
the turmoil. 

When the first warning came, a 
special flash to the Gatekeeper, 
Hugh had tried to take her to the 
Gate with him. But she had 
pointed out that it was test night 
and he’d have to be at the Gate 
until after midnight. So if they 
both went there straight away, 
and the fighting went on into the 
evening, they’d get nothing to eat 
all day. 

“I’ll stay and fix a picnic din- 
ner, honey,” she had said. “You 
get over right away. I’ll follow 
when I’m ready.” 

He had protested, but she had 
pointed out that she wasn’t under 
strict orders to dive for cover at 
the first hint of a raid, and he 
was. “Maybe I’ll get there be- 
fore anything happens,” she had 
said optimistically. 

But she hadn’t. The fighting 
had lasted for over an hour al- 
ready. And merely by the noise 
and the ground tremors Hugh 
could tell that it was a big raid. 

He clenched and unclenched 
his hands. Didn’t she know that 
he’d rather go hungry all day and 
all night than go through this 
torment? He was so sick with 
worry that by the time she did 
arrive he wouldn’t be able to eat 
anyway. 



Strictly, no one but the Gate- 
keeper himself was allowed in 
the MT area, not even the Gate- 
keeper’s wife. Nearly two years 
ago, however, Hugh had told the 
Secretary flatly that he wouldn’t 
take refuge there unless Alice 
could come too. The Secretary 
had shrugged and said, “Oh, well.” 
So two people out of Moka’s two 
billion were allowed to enter the 
MT enclosure — Hugh and Alice 
Hawkins. The Secretary wasn’t. 
The President wasn’t. Most par- 
ticularly the army and navy 
chiefs weren’t. 

Hugh walked across bare con- 
crete to the door through which 
Alice would enter. 

On the other side of that door 
were three sentries. A guardhouse 
was built onto the Gate enclosure 
on the left; and other guards 
protected all the access roads 
around the Gate. Most of the 
time only a token force policed 
the checkpoints, for the Gate 
without the Gatekeeper was like 
an omelette without eggs. But 
when Hugh was there, and most 
particularly every eleventh night, 
when the tests were run, the Gate 
was guarded more closely than 
the treasury vaults. 

Hugh willed the bell over the 
door to ring. When it did ring, as 
he watched it, he jumped con- 
vulsively, his heart racing from 
shock. Leaping to the door, he 
pressed his thumb to the lock and 



10 



GALAXY 



— slowly and automatically, as 
though alive — it opened. 

A LICE walked in nonchalantly, 
carrying a picnic basket. She 
was immaculate in a yellow 
nylon shirt and flared red skirt, 
with bubble stockings and red 
plastic shoes, as if she had dressed 
for a picnic in the country instead 
of a dash through a city of de- 
struction and death. 

“Did you have any trouble, 
darling?” Hugh asked, the weight 
suddenly lifted from his heart. 
“You took two hours.” 

“Did I? Well, I had to fix din- 
ner. And naturally I had to 
change. You wouldn’t want your 
wife to look like any ordinary 
pretty girl, would you?” 

“Anyway, you’re here now. 
Let’s go to the office.” 

“Yes, let’s.” She looked round 
the empty concrete arena and 
shuddered slightly. “This place 
gives me the creeps when it’s 
like this. And I used to love it 
when it was busy. Say, Hugh, I 
drove straight through without 
being stopped. There’s three 
guards outside that door, of 
course, but they were the only 
ones I saw.” 

“I guess the raid has disor- 
ganized things. Is it bad out there, 
darling?” 

“Pretty bad,” she said quietly. 
When they reached the office 
in the control block at the cen- 



ter of the area, Hugh phoned the 
checkpoints. He couldn’t get an 
answer from Block A, but Block 
B replied at once. 

“Say, Sergeant, my wife just 
drove straight through. Is some- 
thing wrong?” 

Sergeant Bronowski’s voice 
came back. “We’ve been trying 
to raise Block A, sir, but can’t. 
They may not have been hit, 
though. Communications often go 
during a raid. You think you’re 
okay in there, sir? Hadn’t you 
better go to one of the deep 
shelters?” 

“I’m okay here. The Singalese 
ships won’t harm the Gate,” said 
Hugh confidently. 

“If they’re so careful about the 
Gate, how come they raid Bel- 
cron?” 

“They’ve got to do it occasion- 
ally, Sergeant, in case we trade 
on the protection of the Gate and 
surround it with important per- 
sonnel, munition dumps and our 
most dangerous — to them — 
defense installations.” 

“I get it, sir. Okay, we’ll send 
a party over to Block A. Are you 
going ahead with the tests to- 
night, sir?” 

“Oh, sure. Even if the fighting’s 
still going on, it doesn’t affect the 
tests. But I think the Singalese 
ships will be called off before the 
tests are due.” 

“I hope you’re right, sir. I sure 
hope so.” 



THE GATEKEEPERS 



11 



TTUGH hung up and turned. 
-®--*-Since he found Alice beside 
him, he reached out for her. At 
first he merely meant to touch 
her shoulder, but then, still 
affected by his recent fear when 
he had thought something might 
have happened to her, he found 
himself taking her in his arms 
and kissing her as if the date of 
their wedding had been next 
week instead of ten years past. 

“Well, well,” said Alice, sur- 
prised. “Haven’t you made a 
mistake, Buster? I’m your wife.” 

“My wife is the most wonder- 
ful girl in the world. My wife is 
the most beautiful girl I know. 
My wife is the nicest, kindest, 
cleverest person I ever met.” 

“Thank you, honey,” said Alice, 
kissing him tenderly. “The best of 
it is, all that you said is true.” 

It was true, certainly, that she 
was a beautiful girl. Her oval face 
was the kind beloved by artists 
and photographers but not movie 
directors — she looked too intel- 
ligent to be a film star. And her 
figure at twenty-eight was better 
than it had been at eighteen, when 
Hugh married her. Then she had 
been slim but angular, occasion- 
ally awkward. In the last ten 
years she had developed curves 
that she didn’t possess before, but 
no bulges. 

“I’m really a pretty lucky 
fellow,” Hugh mused. “Married to 
a girl like you. Kept out of any 



danger in the middle of an inter- 
planetary war. Given a nice house 
and paid a fat salary for doing 
not a hell of a lot.” 

A slight cloud passed over 
Alice’s face. Although what Hugh 
said was essentially true, some- 
times she wished Hugh was still 
an ordinary MTO. Since the war 
started four years ago there had 
been five Gatekeepers, and the 
other four hadn’t retired volun- 
tarily. Nor had they been sacked. 

Two years ago, when Hugh had 
been appointed Gatekeeper, it 
had seemed, for one thing, that 
the war with Singal wouldn’t last 
much longer. For another, MTOs 
were on half-pay for the duration, 
since they weren’t doing anything, 
and the Hawkins’s financial posi- 
tion had been close to desperate, 
especially as there had been a 
false alarm at the time that Alice 
was going to have a baby. 

But two years later the war 
was still going on, and nobody 
believed any more that it would 
be over soon. Official propaganda 
was taking the line that it would 
last at least three years more. 
And official propaganda was 
generally over-optimistic. 

Alice turned away and began 
to unpack the basket. Hugh 
moved after her and put his arms 
round her from behind. Although 
he had always known he loved 
her, not for years had he felt as 
he had felt in the last couple of 



12 



GALAXY 



hours, when he was forced to 
face the thought of life without 
her. 

“Darling, it’s much too soon to 
eat,” he whispered. And he began 
to pull her shirt out of the waist- 
band of her skirt. 

“Hugh, it’s the middle of the 
afternoon,” she protested laugh- 
ingly, “and broad daylight — ” 

“And we’re in the center of the 
MT area,” Hugh murmured, “the 
most private place in Belcron.” 
He caressed her bare waist. 

Her breath came faster, “I 
thought we were too old for this 
kind of* behavior,” she said. 

They weren’t. 

II 

/^HET Blaken nodded to the 
^ guard and unlocked the door 
behind him. After he had passed 
through the door and locked it 
again, he expelled his breath in 
a slow sigh of relief, as he always 
did when he was alone in the 
vast MT area at Newlyon. 

Blaken was an old man and it 
had been a long time since he had 
feared death. Yet only here, 
where there could be no danger 
of any kind, did he ever really 
relax. 

He had been the Singalese 
Gatekeeper for eleven months 
now, and it seemed like eleven 
years. It wasn’t death he feared. 
It was the possibility that if he 



were ever tested, he would be 
proved unworthy. Six other Sin- 
galese Gatekeepers had died 
rather than betray their beliefs 
— could he? 

He was becoming more and 
more afraid that he couldn’t. He 
wasn’t brave. Indeed, he knew 
himself to be a physical coward. 
Perhaps he should resign, so that 
one of the two deputies could be 
appointed Gatekeeper. Perhaps it 
was his duty to resign. 

In his mind he ran through the 
events which would follow his 
resignation. There would be sur- 
prise and suspicion when he said 
he wanted to resign, for a man of 
his known beliefs should never 
want to relinquish the post of 
Gatekeeper. Then he would have 
to complete the training of the 
new Gatekeeper. The master lock 
on the MT control board would 
be changed, the new lock keyed 
to the new Gatekeeper and not to 
him. 

And everybody would know 
that he had resigned because he 
was a coward. 

He shook his head. He wasn’t 
brave enough to admit he was a 
coward. Even if it was his duty. 

Besides, if he weren’t Gate- 
keeper, what would he do in this 
bitter, all-embracing war between 
two sister-worlds which had be- 
come enemies? 

Before Chet was appointed 
Gatekeeper, things had been 



THE GATEKEEPERS 



13 



tough for him, for he was a paci- 
fist. In no circumstances would 
he have fought his fellow-man. 
So it was fortunate for him that 
he had been appointed to a job 
in which he had to be one hun- 
dred per cent non-combatant. 

Fortunate? Yes, but the last 
eleven months had hardly been 
the happiest of his life. 

In a few hours he would call 
Hugh Hawkins on Moka and 
they would talk before running 
the routine tests. It was only 
with Hugh, whom he had never 
seen, who was on a world at war 
with his own, that Chet could 
talk these days with any real 
sympathy and friendship. 

TF ever two worlds shouldn’t 

have fought a war, they were 
Moka and Singal. The only two 
inhabited worlds of the Biara 
system, they were so far from 
any other inhabited world that 
contact with the rest of the 
human race was slight and trade 
non-existent. Moka and Singal 
should have been the friendliest 
of sister-worlds, and for a long 
time they had been. There was 
little natural competition: Singal, 
the inner world, was poor in 
metals but rich in food, while 
Moka, a manufacturing world, 
grew little but made everything 
the two worlds needed. 

And when the Gate had finally 
gone into operation after nearly 



fifty years of heartbreaking trial 
and error, and the loss of thou- 
sands of lives, it had seemed less 
than ever likely that the two 
worlds would ever have differ- 
ences more serious than squab- 
bles. Moka and Singal had 
seemed too dependent on each 
other ever to resort to war. The 
matter transmission Gates at Bel- 
cron on Moka and Newlyon on 
Singal had operated ceaselessly 
day and night. Metals, coal, 
manufactured goods, oil and syn- 
thetic textiles had passed through 
the Gate from Moka to Singal; 
meat, hides, wool, butter, cheese, 
grain, vegetables and wine had 
gone from Singal to Moka. The 
exchange had been roughly a mil- 
lion tons per day — roughly, for 
matter transmission was reckoned 
in volume rather than in weight. 

Yet four years ago that had 
suddenly ceased. For four years 
the great MT areas had been 
empty and silent. 

As usual, something to fight 
about had been found. The casus 
belli in this case was the asteroid 
belt between the two worlds. 
Moka was jealously afraid that 
Singal would get all the metals 
she needed there, set up factories 
and thus become independent; 
Singal objected to Moka’s greedy 
cornering of all the natural re- 
sources in the system. 

It had been predictable that 
when war did come it would be 



14 



GALAXY 



long, bitter and indecisive. Moka 
was short of food and Singal was 
short of everything else. But 
Moka could synthesize food and 
Singal could improvise. When the 
war finally did end, it wouldn’t 
be because Moka was starving or 
because Singal had nothing left 
to fight with. 

Chet glanced at his watch. It 
was only 7:23. Tests were usually 
carried out at midnight on the 
eleventh day, since conditions 
were best then on both worlds. 
Ten of Singal’s days equalled 
eleven on Moka, with a little 
matter of eleven minutes over. 
Singal allowed for the eleven 
minutes by an adjustment every 
month. 

TT took Chet five minutes to 

cross the vast reception area and 
reach the control block. He spent 
them envying Hugh Hawkins, not 
because Hugh was young, but be- 
cause Hugh had a wife whom he 
loved and who loved him. Un- 
like Chet Blaken, Hugh Hawkins 
didn’t have to face his vast re- 
sponsibility always alone. 

Chet went straight to the radio 
room and switched on the tape 
recorder. It was too soon to call 
Hugh; Hugh wouldn’t come on 
the air until 11:30. Chet always 
recorded his talks with Hugh, and 
played them back when loneliness 
weighed most heavily on him. In 
the machine was the tape he had 



recorded at the last test, eleven 
days ago. 

The machine started in the 
middle of conversation, the 
quality so good despite the fifty 
million miles between Singal and 
Moka that Hugh’s cheerful young 
voice was reproduced as well as 
Chet’s older, wearier tones. 

. getting very short of white 
wine,” Hugh was saying, “despite 
the fact that it’s all been doctored 
with synthetic grape-juice and 
alcohol to make it go ten times 
as far — making it barely drink- 
able, as you might guess. You 
wouldn’t drink the stuff, Chet. 
But it’s still better than synthetic 
beer.” 

Chet’s own voice: “I’ll slip you 
half a dozen cases in the next test 
transmission. Sorry I can’t get 
them for you now.” 

A slight plop — the tape re- 
corder was monitored to operate 
only when there was a signal, 
and it took nine minutes for 
Chet’s voice to reach Moka and 
the answer return. On playback, 
owing to the monitoring, there 
was no delay. 

“You tempt me, Chet. God 
knows how you tempt me. But I 
won’t accept the offer. If any- 
body found out, there’d be the 
devil to pay. And what hap- 
pened here would be nothing to 
what would happen there if any- 
body discovered you’d been 
transmitting contraband. But I’ll 



THE GATEKEEPERS

tell you what we can do. I’ll send 
you that metal fishing-rod you 
wanted, made out of a new alloy, 
and your story can be that we 
wanted to test whether MT 
affected the temper. You’ll get 
away with that because nothing 
of this material has ever been 
sent through the Gate. And you 
can send me a dozen chickens.” 
“Chickens?” Chet echoed, as- 
tonished. “I can’t do that, Hugh. 
I’ll get hung. Food is Number 
One contraband. One chicken, 
maybe, alive, since a living 
creature is the best test. But not 
a dozen, for Pete’s sake. Hell, 
you wouldn’t take wine and you 
want chickens! Have you gone 
crazy in the head, Hugh?” 

The plop again, and then 
Hugh’s chuckle. “This is some- 
thing that can only be worked so 
often, Chet, but the last time was 
three years ago, before our time. 
You send a live chicken on test, 
right? Only something goes 
wrong and the chicken arrives 
dead — but edible, of course. 
Naturally the two Gatekeepers 
get worried and you send out for 
more live chickens and we use 
a different link. Only the next 
one arrives dead too. This goes 
on until I have eleven dead 
chickens, and after that one 
comes through alive, and we’re 
both relieved we’ve found the 
fault and cured it.” 

“I get it. Okay, you can have 



your chickens. And I’ll sure be 
glad to get that fishing-rod. The 
season’s just starting here.” 

T^HERE the taped conversation 
ended, for after that the tests 
had begun and Chet never taped 
what was said then. Hugh wasn’t 
so careful. He even had his wife 
with him sometimes. From things 
which had been said Chet 
gathered that she was very beau- 
tiful, and she certainly had a 
lovely voice. He would have liked 
to see a picture of her but had 
never liked to ask for one in case 
the request should be misunder- 
stood. He thought of Alice as a 
friend, like Hugh. 

Looking at his watch again, 
Chet saw that it was barely eight 
o’clock. Still three and a half 
hours to go. 

These regular tests were more 
than just routine. MT depended 
on countless millions of transmit- 
ting and receiving links being in 
perfect register. Every slight de- 
viation had to be detected and 
corrected at once. Moreover, all 
the variables — solar interfer- 
ence, gravitic bias, bounce effect, 
space dust concentration — had 
to be laboriously plotted and 
allowed for as they occurred. 
The Gatekeepers didn’t do all 
the calculations themselves, but 
they had to make all the adjust- 
ments. 

It was because of all this that 



16 



GALAXY 



it hadn’t been possible, when the 
war started, simply to close down 
the MT stations for the duration. 
Unless they were kept in con- 
stant register there would be no 
Gate at the end of the war — 
merely two vast junkheaps. 

So it was necessary that if the 
Gate was to be preserved, it must 
be regularly tested and adjusted. 
But not used, except for the 
tests. Obviously. 

The ringing of Chet’s phone 
bell was a welcome diversion. He 
snapped the switch and the 
sentry’s voice came through, 
sounding puzzled. “Guy here with 
a truck, Gatekeeper," he said. 
“Apparently passed through the 
other checkpoints okay. Says 
something about chickens.” 

“That’s right,” said Chet. “I’ll 
be right out.” 

He walked back through the 
vast, empty arena. Hugh Haw- 
kins would get his chickens. Chet 
had arranged the matter so that 
even if an official inquiry was 
made, which was unlikely, he’d 
be in the clear. He would take in 
only one bird, leaving the others 
outside the Gate in the care of 
the sentries. But a little after 
twelve o’clock he’d be out again, 
looking agitated, and telling the 
sentries that there was something 
wrong, that he’d need some more 
chickens. 

It was strange, Chet thought, 
that two men like Hugh and him- 



self, who would die if they had 
to (and they might easily have 
to) in order to discharge their 
main responsibility as Gatekeep- 
ers, were quite unconcerned about 
illegally slipping a friend a steel 
fishing-rod or a dozen chickens. 

Ill 

TTUGH sipped his wine, made a 
-®--®-face, shrugged and drank 
some more. Catching Alice’s eye, 
he blew her a kiss. 

She was sleek and immaculate 
again, and there was nothing to 
show that she had so recently 
been so active in the emotions 
of love. Indeed, she looked like 
a wise virgin. The virginal 
quality in her beauty had always 
been one of her chief charms, 
and after ten years of marriage 
she seemed in no danger of losing 
it. 

They had eaten a fair meal, 
considering how uninteresting 
synthetic food generally was. 
And the wine, poor as it was, was 
better than no wine at all. 

“Chet Blaken offered to send 
half a dozen cases of wine,” Hugh 
said. 

“And you didn’t take it?” 

“Couldn’t very well. How 
could I carry out half a dozen 
cases of wine without anybody 
noticing?” 

“If you gave the guards a bot- 
tle each they wouldn’t notice.” 



THE GATEKEEPERS

Hugh shook his head. “Once 
bribery starts, corruption soon 
sets in. I told Chet to make it a 
dozen chickens instead, and we 
have a story to cover us in case 
anybody finds out.” 

“How are you going to carry 
them out?” 

“Simple. In the picnic basket.” 
Alice nodded at the fishing-rod 
in a canvas case leaning against 
the wall. “That’s for Chet?” 
“Yes. We’ve got a story for 
that, too.” 

“I’m sorry for Chet,” Alice 
said quietly. “People don’t un- 
derstand how it is with Gate- 
keepers. But we’ve got each 
other. He’s got nobody.” 

“Huh? What are you talking 
about, darling?” 

“Maybe I get it more than 
you. People treating me as a sort 
of enemy, because you’re the 
Gatekeeper. Everybody knows 
that if you let the army and the 
navy have their way, the war 
would be over in a week.” 

“But there’s an agreement . ” 
“/ know, honey, you don’t have 
to convince me. You and Chet 
are guardians, to see the Gate 
isn’t used or tampered with, so 
that it’ll still be there when the 
war’s over. And if Singal didn’t 
trust you, or Moka didn’t trust 
Chet, the Gate would just have 
to be destroyed. But people who 
have lost sons, daughters, hus- 
bands and parents aren’t very 



reasonable. All they can see is 
that if you let the army send 
through an atom bomb that 
would blow up half Singal — ” 

“If I did, it would be the big- 
gest sell-out in history.” 

“Of course it would. But don’t 
you see, honey — 1 know all that, 
I agree with you, I can stand 
anything that happens because I 
know we’re right. But Chet hasn’t 
got a lovely understanding wife 
like me.” 

“I knew it was a mistake to 
say all those nice things about 
you.” 

f'T'HEY stopped to listen as a 
screaming noise far away be- 
gan as a high whisper and became 
a shriek. It sounded more like a 
ship than a shell. Abruptly the 
scream was cut off and the 
ground shivered, although the 
ship must have crashed at least 
ten miles away. 

They said nothing about what 
they had heard; there was noth- 
ing to say. 

The phone bell rang. Bronow- 
ski’s voice said: “Block A was 
flattened. Gatekeeper. None of 
the men got out. But we’ve sewn 
everything up now, sir. There’s 
no risk of anybody getting 
through.” 

Hugh acknowledged the mes- 
sage and put down the instru- 
ment. He looked round, puzzled, 
as he heard Alice gasp. 



18 



GALAXY 



Three men stood in the door- 
way, three men in the dark green 
uniform of the Mokan Army. 
One was a general and the other 
two were colonels. All three had 
guns covering both Hugh and 
Alice. 

“Stand away from that phone, 
Hawkins, or I’ll shoot your wife 
dead,” the general said harshly. 

For the next few minutes 
Hugh was to curse himself for 
doing as he was told. If he had 
picked up the phone Alice would 
certainly have been shot, and 
probably himself as well. But the 
guard force would have been 
alerted, and whatever the raiders 
had in mind would have failed. 

But hope springs eternal in the 
human breast, and Hugh had 
stepped away from the phone, 
hoping that some other way might 
be found, before he realized that 
he wasn’t going to get such a 
chance again. 

One of the colonels moved be- 
tween Hugh and the phone. The 
other moved behind Alice, whose 
face was ashen. 

“I’m General Howth,” said the 
tall, lean-faced man who led the 
group. “Don’t be alarmed, Mrs. 
Hawkins. We’re no renegades. 
We have the full backing of the 
Army.” 

“But not of the government,” 
Hugh said sharply. 

“As you say. There are times 
of extreme emergency when it’s 



necessary to take special powers 
and bypass the government, Haw- 
kins.” 

“You’re wasting your time,” 
said Hugh. “I presume you have 
some scheme for using the Gate, 
and consequently need me. It’ll 
save a lot of trouble if you realize 
that I’ll never co-operate with 
you, and that nothing you can do 
will make me.” 

“Your wife is here, Hawkins,” 
said Hpwth meaningly. 

TTUGH shook his head wearily. 

“Why is it that military 
chiefs never have any imagina- 
tion? Why is it they always see 
only their own side of any prob- 
lem? General, the Gate cost 
four hundred million million dol- 
lars to install, and it took fifty 
years to do it. It took thousands 
of ships, Mokan and Singalese, 
strung out in space to relay the 
first transmissions. Thousands of 
men died before it was working 
properly. And when the war 
started, nothing would have been 
easier, here or on Singal, than to 
destroy one installation so that 
the whole colossal, dangerous, 
expensive, heart-breaking job 
would have to be done again 
after the war. Didn’t it give you 
some hope for the human race 
when the governments of Moka 
and Singal decided four years 
ago that even though temporarily 
we were going to be at war, the

Gate would be maintained and 
never used, so that it would still 
be there when the war was over? 
Didn’t you feel, as I did, that at 
last human beings were beginning 
to act like adults instead of mal- 
adjusted children?” 

Alice turned her eyes to 
Howth, praying that Hugh’s ap- 
peal would have some effect. 
Couldn’t he see that what Hugh 
said was so? 

When wars started, soldiers 
invariably blew up tunnels and 
bridges and roads that led across 
and under the defended lines. 
Naturally. And three or four 
years later, when the war was 
over, the bridges and tunnels and 
roads were rebuilt. 

But the Gate, the matter-trans- 
mission link between Belcron on 
Moka and Newlyon on Singal, 
was something bigger than any 
tunnel or bridge or road. Bigger, 
and yet more vulnerable. Obvi- 
ously neither planet could allow 
it to be used while the state of 
war existed. But if it were de- 
stroyed — and destruction of 
that tenuous link would be trag- 
ically easy — then when the war 
was over, as one day it would 
be over, the vast labor of re- 
constructing the Gate, and the 
vast expense, would have to be 
borne by two wounded, bleeding 
worlds who were dependent on 
each other and would always be 
dependent on each other, even if 

20 

r - i f * .

they quarreled often and occa- 
sionally fought. 

And it might take another fifty 
years — fifty years during which 
there could be no prosperity on 
either world, not without the 
Gate. It might, in such circum- 
stances, take more than fifty 
years. There might never be a 
Gate again. 

So the governments of Moka 
and Singal had said: Right, we’re 
at war, and the Gate must go into 
cold storage. But whatever hap- 
pens, whoever wins and whoever 
loses, the Gate is going to be 
needed again. Instead of destroy- 
ing this wonderful thing that 
took so long to create, we’ll ap- 
point men independent of the 
war, independent of Moka or 
Singal, who will maintain the 
link without ever allowing it to 
be used for purposes of war. Men 
who alone, one in Belcron and 
one in Newlyon, will be able to 
control the Gate. 

Men of such honesty and sin- 
cerity and idealism that Moka 
can trust the Sinhalese Gate- 
keeper and Singal can trust the 
Gatekeeper on Moka. 

And since the war began four 
years ago, the Gate had never 
been used except for the regular 
tests operated bv the two Gate- 
keepers. But Moka now had its 
fifth Gatekeepers and Singal had 
its seventh. Ten men had been 
idealistic enough to die for their

ideals. And it began to seem that 
the toll would soon rue. 

A LICE’S eyes sought Howth’s, 
and she saw with a stab of 
pain in her heart that he was 
quite unmoved by Hugh’s appeal. 

“Hawkins,” Howth said grim- 
ly, “we’re losing this war. Yet we 
have a weapon that can win it. 
An atom bomb through the Gate 
... a battalion of men ... a flight 
of bombers ... a bacteriological 
onslaught. Five minutes’ use of 
the Gate could win the war for 
us. And you say — ” 

“I say it’s never going to hap- 
pen,” said Hugh. “General, have 
you ever heard the name Chet 
Blaken?” 

The General frowned. “Blak- 
en? No.” 

“He’s my colleague, my friend. 
Chet Blaken is the Gatekeeper 
at Newlyon. If it weren’t for Chet 
Blaken, an atom bomb would 
come through our Gate. Or a bat- 
talion of men. Or a flight of 
bombers. Or just tainted air car- 
rying pestilence that would kill 
us all. But Chet Blaken is so 
honest that even you thrust him.” 
“That’s where you’re wrong. 
The army believes that we must 
use the Gate to defeat Singal be- 
fore Singal uses it to defeat us.” 
“For Christ’s sake, General, 
use your head! Singal could have 
done this fiendish thing you want 
to do any time in the last four 



years. Six Singalese Gatekeepers 
have been killed seeing that no- 
body did.” 

“This argument is singularly 
pointless,” Howth said coldly. 
“Hawkins, the Army means to 
use the Gate.” 

“And I tell you that it never 
will.” 

“You don’t understand, Haw- 
kins. You accepted our appear- 
ance with commendable coolness. 
You haven’t asked how we got 
here. Although we took advan- 
tage of the raid to get past Block 
A, we found it necessary to kill 
the three guards and substitute 
men of our own. You’ll under- 
stand from this that we’re quite 
determined.” 

“You’re crazy killers,” said 
Hugh bitterly. 

“Please, Hawkins,” Howth 
said, and through his voice came 
the first hint that he was a man 
with human feelings, “don’t make 
this any worse than it has to be. 
You must be aware that we’re 
prepared to cut your wife to 
pieces before your eyes if neces- 
sary. Or if you seem able to bear 
your wife’s pain better than your 
own, we can demonstrate that 
you can suffer terrible agony 
without any possibility of escap- 
ing by dying. Please recognize 
this and act like a reasonable 
man.” 

Hugh said nothing. His eyes 
sought Alice’s, and they tried to 



22 



GALAXY 



sum up ten happy years together 
in one final moment together. 

IV 

/^HET unlocked the door and 
^ opened it. The three guards 
were wary but not really suspi- 
cious; anything which got past 
the other checkpoints must be 
all right. And besides, the small 
dilapidated livestock truck driven 
by one old man didn’t look as 
if it need concern them very 
much. 

Their wariness didn’t do them 
any good. 

The silent shots from the in- 
terior of the truck must have 
been absolutely simultaneous. 
The three sentries dropped with 
hardly a sigh, two of them with 
their heads blown off and the 
third with a hole the size of a 
soup-plate in his chest. Only a 
second or so later Chet was 
seized from both sides and 
bundled back through the door 
from which he had just emerged. 

There were six men in all, 
dressed in rough, dark clothes 
and all with cloths over their 
faces. Alarmed as he was, Chet 
couldn’t help finding this slightly 
reassuring. The fact that he 
wesn’t to be allowed to see their 
faces strongly suggested that he 
was going to be alive afterwards. 
If he was to meet the same fate 
as the guards they wouldn’t be 



concerned about whether he’d 
recognize them again or not. 

A short man with sparse fair 
hair did the talking: “Everything 
has gone like clockwork, Blaken, 
so you needn’t waste your time 
thinking you’re going to be 
rescued. The truck will drive 
back in a few minutes and check 
out. The guards on the door 
aren’t due to be relieved until 
two o’clock: So we won’t be dis- 
turbed.” 

“Who are you?” Chet de- 
manded. It wasn’t a very intelli- 
gent question to ask six masked 
men, but he felt the need to force 
himself to be bluntly defiant. 
Now that the crisis had come, he 
was as scared as he had always 
feared he would be. 

They were marching him back 
to the control building. One of 
them ran on ahead to check up. 

The short man laughed. He 
wasn’t scared. Indeed, he seemed 
exultant, as perhaps he had a 
right to be. A successful raid on 
the Gate must have been well 
planned and faultlessly carried 
through. Chet’s request that a 
livestock truck should be passed 
through must have been seized 
on as a heaven-sent opportunity. 
Chet still didn’t see how the truck 
had been able to get through with 
six men concealed in it, but that 
was an academic point, no longer 
of any great interest. They were 
here. Perhaps some of the guards

at the checkpoints had been 
heavily bribed beforehand. 

“You can call me the Peace- 
maker,” the blond man said, “for 
I’m going to end the war.” He 
chuckled, pleased with himself. 

r T , HEY reached the control 
•*- block and Chet was nudged 
back into the radio room he had 
recently left. The man who called 
himself the Peacemaker had a 
quick look round. Apparently 
satisfied, he nodded. Three of the 
men went out, probably to go 
to the entrance of the MT area 
and pose as the sentries who had 
been murdered. 

“You may as well know the 
situation,” the Peacemaker said. 
“We left a box outside just now. 
At midnight you will send that 
box through the Gate to Moka. 
The instant it arrives, tempera- 
ture and atmospheric pressure 
differences will cause it to deto- 
nate, spraying bacteria over a 
large area.” 

He shrugged. “I grant that if 
Moka expected this, or learned ex- 
actly what had happened within 
a few minutes, it might be pos- 
sible to destroy the whole area 
and nullify our efforts. But Moka 
won’t realize what has happened 
for some hours. They will be re- 
luctant to destroy the Belcron 
Gate, and by the time any 
countermeasures are taken they 
will be much too late.” 



“You fool,” said Chet contemp- 
tuously, and he had the satis- 
faction of seeing the Peacemaker 
draw himself up angrily. “You 
can’t do this crazy thing without 
me, and you certainly can’t do 
it with me.” 

“You’re going to find just what 
kind of a fool I am,” said the 
other man. Clearly he was an 
egotist; Chet had touched him on 
the raw. “Listen. Our organiza- 
tion found out that tonight a 
heavy Singalese raid is being 
made on Belcron. We know that 
the Navy’s orders are to destroy 
as much as possible in the neigh- 
borhood of the Gate there with- 
out damaging the Gate itself. 
Knowing this, knowing that there 
would be chaos in Belcron at this 
moment, we decided that tonight 
was the time to win this war. We 
discovered also that you had 
given orders that a truck was to 
be passed through. It was neces- 
sary then to — ” 

“You fool,” said Chet again. “I 
gather you belong to some tinpot 
so-called patriotic organization? 
Friends of Singal, Singalese Vic- 
tory Party, or something of the 
sort? Don’t you think the Gov- 
ernment knows what’s best for 
Singal? Of course you don’t. Like 
all crazy fanatics, you — ” 

“Blaken,” said the other furi- 
ously, “if you were not necessary 
to us I’d have you shot as those 
guards were shot. You’re a traitor. 



24 



GALAXY 



You want Singal to lose this 
war.” 

“Like all fanatics, you see a 
little bit of the problem and dis- 
miss everything else as unimpor- 
tant,” said Chet. He was finding 
that so long as he talked as if he 
wasn’t afraid, he almost suc- 
ceeded in preventing himself 
from being afraid. “Suppose this 
insane plan of yours works. The 
culture you wish to release in 
Moka will presumably cause an 
epidemic which will spread over 
the whole world and into the 
Mokan Navy. Inevitably, if it is 
sufficiently virulent to bring 
Moka to her knees, it will spread 
here too, and — ” 

“We have the antidote. Moka 
hasn’t. Everything has been 
thought of, Blaken.” 

/"'HET tried another approach. 
^ “Can’t you see that Moka 
and Singal are dependent on 
each other? That if you weaken 
Moka, you weaken Singal? When 
this war ends, as it must end, 
Singal is going to need Moka!” 

The short man spun on his 
heel. “Number Two, get that 
syringe ready. Three, hold this 
old man.” 

Chet felt a stab of fear again. 
They were going to drug him, 
make him incapable of resisting 
them. His fear made him speak 
when a braver man would have 
said nothing. 



“I said you were a fool. You’re 
going to drug me with menticol 
or narco-meryllium. You know 
that only I can operate the Gate, 
that only the individual pattern 
of my brain’s impulses will un- 
lock the machines? Without me 
the Gate is useless. Don’t you 
know that if I am drugged, my 
brain pattern alters so that even 
I can’t operate the machines?” 
The Peacemaker’s muffled 
curse showed that he had heard 
something of the sort but had 
hoped that it wasn’t true. 

Chet already wished that he 
had stayed silent. True, menticol 
would damage his brain seriously 
and probably permanently, but it 
would have been quick and easy. 
He could have let them drug him, 
knowing that although he would 
soon cease to be aware of what 
was going on and he might do 
and say things that would horrify 
him if he knew about them, he 
couldn’t be made to operate the 
Gate. 

“Go ahead,” he said. “Try it. 
Drug me and see what happens.” 
“It will have to be the other 
way,” said the man who called 
himself the Peacemaker. “Do you 
enjoy pain, Blaken?” 

And Chet knew that he was 
going to need all the courage he 
could screw up, and more. A 
fanatic would stop at nothing, be- 
cause fanatics always knew — 
knew beyond all possibility of 



THE GATEKEEPERS

doubt — that they and they alone 
were right. 

This was what Gatekeepers 
always feared. That was what 
Gatekeepers always had to be 
prepared for. No matter how 
carefully the Gate was guarded, 
sooner or later a group of so- 
called patriots temporarily cap- 
tured the Gate and its Gate- 
keeper. This was the seventh time 
it had happened in four years. 

And the other six Gatekeepers 
had duly died to protect the 
Gate and the Gate agreement. So 
the six previous attempts had 
been abject failures. 

But where was Chet Blaken 
going to get the courage to make 
the seventh a failure too? 

V 

"IV’ATURALLY Hugh Hawkins 
^ ^ didn’t suspect for a moment 
that on Singal Chet Blaken might 
be going through the same kind 
of ordeal at exactly the same 
time. Although at various times 
and in various ways attempts had 
been made on both worlds to 
force the current Gatekeeper to 
assist in some unofficial or semi- 
official attempt to bypass the 
rigid Government control of the 
Gate, at no time had there ever 
been simultaneous attempts on 
both worlds. 

Yet the coincidence was not 
remarkable. It had been the Sin- 



galese raid on Belcron which had 
made the Singalese extremists 
decide on this particular time for 
their effort; and it was the Sin- 
galese raid on Belcron which 
allowed General Howth and his 
Army opportunists to slip into 
the MT area undetected by the 
guards. 

No one but the gods knew that 
there was a risk of pestilence 
from Singal being released on 
Moka at the same time as an 
atom bomb from Moka exploded 
on Singal. The old classical gods, 
certainly, would have been 
amused. It was the kind of situa- 
tion they enjoyed. 

Hugh had been shown the 
bomb. It lay outside in one of 
the transmission bays, a small, 
uninteresting object which looked 
like a two-gallon water can. De- 
spite its unimpressive appearance, 
it could destroy a quarter of the 
population of Singal, and more 
than a quarter of Singal’s ma- 
terial resources. Undoubtedly this 
would be enough to end the war. 

“It would be sensible to bow 
to the inevitable,” Howth said. 

Hugh shook his head. 

Howth turned. “Take the 
woman outside,” he ordered 
harshly, “and soften her up. Then 
bring her back and the real busi- 
ness can begin.” 

A black-browed colonel seized 
Alice roughly by her belt. When 
she started to struggle he cuffed 



26 



GALAXY 



her hard on each side of the head, 
heavy blows that buffeted her a 
foot each way. 

Hugh leaped at the colonel. 
The paralyzing charge from the 
third man’s gun caught him in 
midair. He collapsed like a sack 
of potatoes and didn’t even see 
Alice being dragged out. 

T HERE was no pain; his nerves 
were temporarily dead. He 
could see nothing but the floor 
under his face, so close that his 
eyes couldn’t focus on it. He 
could hear, however. He heard 
Alice run, her high heels beating 
a staccato patter of fear on the 
concrete. He heard her fall 
heavily. He heard her scream. He 
heard sickening noises that 
sounded like a boot being driven 
hard into a soft body. He heard 
Alice sobbing in anguish and, 
worse, begging and pleading. 

The paralyzing charge had 
been minimal. Hugh was able to 
squirm within seconds, and as 
Alice was brought back he was 
climbing stiffly and awkwardly 
to his feet. 

There .was hardly any change 
in her appearance, apart from the 
fact that her hair was disordered. 
But the bloom was off her. She 
wasn’t lovely and assured any 
more. Her fear made her look 
almost ugly, and it was horrible 
to see her cowering away from 
the man who had hurt her. 



Howth faced Hugh. “Are you 
going to send that bomb 
through?” 

“No,” said Hugh wearily. 

Howth looked at his watch. 
“The Singalese Gatekeeper will 
expect you to call him in three 
hours’ time. Three hours is a 
long time. It can be made to seem 
longer. For the last time, are you 
going to co-operate, Hawkins?” 

“No.” 

Hugh found himself collapsing 
again. The man behind him must 
have paralyzed him. Helpless, he 
was hauled up, sat on a chair 
and tied in it. He saw Alice only 
when his head happened to be 
turned in her direction. 

When they had finished with 
him, they tied Alice in another 
chair facing him. Hugh tried to 
smile at her but couldn’t. The 
paralysis hadn’t worn off yet. 

Howth’s voice was exasperated. 
“We don’t want to do this, Haw- 
kins. We’re not enjoying it. But 
we have to make you send that 
bomb through. Carry on, Berton.” 

Berton was enjoying it. Hugh 
could see that. Slowly, with lasci- 
vious pleasure, he cut away 
Alice’s shirt, piece by piece, until 
she was quite nude above the 
waist. Hugh writhed in fury when 
he saw the dark contusions on 
her ribs, the huge angry red 
mark on her side. 

Berton enjoyed suspense, too. 
Turning away from Alice, he left 



THE GATEKEEPERS 



27 



her like that while he prowled 
about the room, picking up things 
and laying them down again. 
Presently he found something 
which interested him. It was the 
metal fishing-rod intended for 
Chet Blaken. He took out the 
top section, the thinnest, springi- 
est part of the rod, and tried 
whipping the air with it experi- 
mentally. The swish it made in 
the air seemed to delight him. 
He kept cracking the rod vicious- 
ly and then looking at Alice, who 
had gone very pale. 

“Get on with it, Berton,” said 
Howth harshly. 

“Yes, sir.” 

A LICE closed her eyes as 
Berton approached her with 
the rod. A moment later, how- 
ever, she opened them again, un- 
able to wait passively, unable to 
pretend that what happened to 
the pale half-naked body tied in 
a chair was a matter of no con- 
cern to her. 

Berton swung with the rod and 
a fraction of a second later Alice 
screamed — a raw, agonized 
scream which showed that the 
pain was worse than anything 
she had expected. A straight red 
line was drawn across her ribs, 
blood just beginning to ooze from 
it and spoil the. thin, neat line. 
Berton swung again, and this time 
the sound of the blow was 
covered by another scream from 



Alice; she screamed before the 
blow landed. Another red line 
nearly a foot long spurted bright 
red, across her shoulders this 
time. There was a gap of an inch 
or so in the middle. The hollow 
between her breasts began just 
there and the steel whip hadn’t 
quite reached the bottom of the 
cleft. 

For the third time Berton 
struck, and this time Alice hadn’t 
stopped screaming between the 
strokes. The third long red line 
was only an inch above her skirt, 
on the soft flesh of her waist. 
There was no bone there to pro- 
tect her, and this time the gash 
was as deep as a sword-slash. 
Blood gushed down and tried to 
hide on her red skirt. 

Hugh didn’t realize he was 
going to surrender until he had 
done so. He never remembered 
afterwards what he said. He 
would have said anything to stop 
what Berton was doing to Alice. 
After he had said it, whatever it 
was, he was conscious only of re- 
lief as Berton reluctantly stepped 
back, mingled with horror as 
Alice slumped in a faint. For a 
moment Hugh was afraid she was 
dead. 

Howth was speaking, but Hugh 
didn’t listen. All that mattered 
was that Alice would be hurt no 
more. He didn’t regret his sur- 
render; he only regretted that he 
had delayed it. Whatever hap- 



28 



GALAXY 



pened, even if a miracle somehow 
saved them both, Alice would 
carry three terrible scars to her 
grave. 

Whether Hugh would keep his 
word was another matter alto- 
gether. It didn’t trouble his con- 
science that he had told the Gen- 
eral he would do as he was told, 
without having the slightest in- 
tention of actually sending an 
atom bomb through the Gate to 
Newlyon. Even if he had merely 
postponed Alice’s ordeal for a 
few hours, that was something. 

Of one thing there was no 
doubt. He couldn’t have let Ber- 
ton beat Alice to death. He would 
say anything rather than allow 
that. 

Whether he would do anything 
rather than allow that still re- 
mained to be seen . 

I T was 11:25. “Watch him,” 
said the Peacemaker as Chet 
began to snap switches. “If he 
does anything but what he said 
he’d do, let him have it.” 

Apart from the waiting, Chet 
hadn’t had a bad time. More 
sensibly, perhaps, than Hugh 
Hawkins, he had allowed the 
threat of torture to convince him. 

In a way all attempts to coerce 
a Gatekeeper were futile. In the 
end, he had to be in sole control 
of the machines. Whatever had 
been said and done, whatever he 
had promised, the question in the 



end was whether he would be- 
tray his trust and save his life 
or toss his life away and in doing 
so make all schemes to control 
him, and through him the Gate, 
a complete waste of time. 

The trouble was, his life was 
forfeit. Chet knew perfectly well 
that if he jammed or fused or 
disoriented the machines so that 
matter transmission was tempo- 
rarily impossible, the Peacemaker 
would not say to him: “Okay, 
you win. We’ll go away and leave 
you in peace.” 

Ten other Gatekeepers, faced 
with something like this situation, 
had been able to do their duty. 
Six on Singal and four on Moka. 
Was he going to add to the list? 
Or was he to be the first without 
the courage to guard the Gate 
with his life? 

It was Hugh’s turn to speak 
first this time. But the clock on 
the wall registered 11:30, and 
then 11:31, and still no sound 
emerged from the loudspeaker. 

The Peacemaker was impa- 
tient. “I thought you said — ” 

“I told you,” Chet explained. 
“Hawkins began to transmit at 
23:30. But we won’t hear his 
voice until nearly 23:35. Wait.” 

“When he speaks,” said the 
Peacemaker grimly, “do exactly 
what you always do. Don’t think 
you can outsmart us, Blaken. 
Don’t try talking in code that 
he’ll understand and we don’t. 



THE GATEKEEPERS 



29 



Unless that case goes through the 
Gate, you’re going to die. Re- 
member that.” 

Chet nodded. There was no 
need to act scared. He was scared. 
Being scared, he could try to act 
as if he weren’t. 

At last it came: “Hugh Haw- 
kins, Mokan Gatekeeper. You 
there, Chet?” 

“I’m here, Hugh,” Chet said. 
He knew what to do; the only 
question was whether he could 
do it or not. The impulse to post- 
pone the moment was strong — 
so strong that he knew that if he 
started postponing, he’d go on 
postponing. 

“This is Chet Blaken, Singalese 
Gatekeeper. You know my voice, 
don’t you? Well, there are three 
men here with me. They — ” 

There were two loud curses, 
and a shot. Chet Blaken’s brains, 
the only brains in existence 
which could operate the Singa- 
lese Gate, were splashed against 
the metal case of the radio trans- 
mitter. 

Chet Blaken hadn’t failed after 
all. 

VI 

A T Belcron they all had to 
wait four and a half minutes 
for Chet’s reply. Howth and the 
two colonels were very careful to 
say nothing; anything they did 
or said would be picked up on 



Singal and the Singalese Gate- 
keeper would instantly switch off 
his matter transmitter. 

Alice was pale and drawn, 
wrapped in Hugh’s jacket. Howth 
had let Hugh wash her wounds 
and bind them up, but they had 
no opportunity to talk privately. 
She had tried to talk with her 
eyes, pleading, despite her fear, 
despite her desire to live, that 
whatever he did he wouldn’t send 
the atom bomb through the Gate. 
Without words she had tried to 
tell him that although she had 
screamed, although she had 
pleaded, she didn’t want them to 
purchase their lives at such a 
price. 

Hugh himself still didn’t know 
what he was going to do. The 
bomb wasn’t going through, that 
was certain. But exactly how he 
was going to handle the situation 
he didn’t yet know. Perhaps 
something Chet said would give 
him a clue. 

Then Chet’s voice came. “I’m 
here, Hugh.” A pause. “This is 
Chet Blaken, Singalese Gate- 
keeper. You know my voice don’t 
you? Well, there are three men 
here with me. They — ” 

They heard other voices curs- 
ing, and the sound of a shot. 
Then silence. 

Hugh began to laugh. It was 
semi-hysteria. There was nothing 
funny about. the death of Chet 
Blaken, Singalese Gatekeeper, 



30 



GALAXY 



his friend. The laughter was 
shock, not humor. 

Howth was slapping him. “Get 
that bomb through!” he was 
slapping him. “Get that bomb 
through!” he was shouting. “Get 
it through now, before — ” 

“It’s too late,” said Hugh, get- 
ting control of himself with an 
effort. “It’s much too late. There 
can’t be any matter transmission 
without Chet, and Chet’s dead.” 
“He may not be dead. What 
we heard may be — ” 

“It doesn’t matter whether he’s 
dead or not. The microphone was 
on when you started shouting.” 
Howth cursed. In his frustra- 
tion he caught sight of Alice. 
“Berton!” he snapped. 

Hugh didn’t wait for the order 
Howth was going to give. He in- 
terrupted quickly, forcing them 
to listen, to think, to realize that 
fury at their failure could ac- 
complish nothing. 

“Don’t you understand? What 
happened here happened at New- 
lyon too. There was somebody 
with Chet, trying to make him do 
what you were trying to make me 
do. Don’t you understand yet? 
Chet Blaken died to save Moka .” 
Howth paused. 

It wouldn’t have any perma- 
nent effect. He was not a man 
of much imagination. But for an 
instant he glimpsed something 
that he had never seen before and 
would never see again — that 



there were things more important 
than victory, even in the middle 
of a bitter war. 

He growled and gestured to 
the other two. And the next mo- 
ment they were gone. 

Alice threw herself in Hugh’s 
arms, winced with pain and then 
broke down completely. Hugh 
wondered if he should phone the 
guards to warn them that there 
were men coming out of the MT 
area, but decided it was unneces- 
sary. Anyone at all, except Hugh 
or Alice Hawkins, who emerged 
from the Gate area would be held 
under heavy guard. Even a gen- 
eral and two colonels. 

There would be a court-mar- 
tial. The three men wouldn’t get 
the death sentence, but they’d 
get long terms of imprisonment. 

Of course they had known that 
all along, and went ahead any- 
way. They were patriots. 

r I ''HAT wasn’t the end. The end 
came three days later. 

The Secretary sent for Hugh. 
Hugh thought nothing about the 
summons, asuming that the Sec- 
retary merely wished to talk 
about the Howth affair or to 
inform him of new security ar- 
rangements ■ designed to make 
sure that nothing of the sort 
could ever happen again. But 
when he saw the Secretary’s face, 
Hugh knew that the matter was 
much more important than that. 



THE GATEKEEPERS 



31 



“This is in strict confidence, 
Hawkins,” the Secretary said. 

“Of course, sir:” Although a 
Gatekeeper was a great and im- 
portant and valuable person, he 
naturally addressed the Secre- 
tary as “sir.” 

“Singal is prepared to make 
peace,” said the Secretary. 

Hugh jumped to his feet. 
“That’s great news, sir.” 

“Wait. The terms Singal offers 
are . .” He shrugged. “Not good, 
not bad. Barely acceptable. The 
point is, Hawkins — this is what 
I want to consult you about — 
they say the reason for offering 
terms concerns the Gate.” 

“The Gate, sir?” 

“It seems ... I don’t pretend 
to be an expert on these matters, 
Hawkins. Although the Gate is 
in my department, there is so 
much secrecy that . However. 
The Singalese Gatekeeper, as we 
all know, died defending the 
Gate. I understand that there are 
always two deputies available 
with the necessary knowledge 
and training, and that in such a 
case one is selected as the new 
Gatekeeper and the installation 
is keyed to his brain pattern.” 
“That’s so, sir.” 

“The Singalese government 
tells us that one of these deputies 
died in a raid a week ago and the 
other was killed yesterday in a 
motor accident. They say that 
there is consequently only one 



way in which the Gate can be 
saved. They say they are pre- 
pared to make peace so that this 
thing can be done. What I want 
to ask you, Hawkins, is this: Is 
this a Singalese maneuver to gain 
some advantage, or is what they 
say likely to be true?” 

Hugh was suddenly very hap- 
py and very proud. “You can 
take the Singalese offer at its 
face value, sir. The only way the 
Gate can be saved is to appoint 
one of our deputies here and for 
me to go to Singal and establish 
a new Singalese Gatekeeper. 
That is, unless — ” he paused for 
a moment, the implications of the 
situation only gradually unfold- 
ing themselves to him — “unless 
both brain locks are removed and 
the Gate is thrown open again.” 
“In which case you’d still 
have to go to Singal?” 

“Yes, sir, if the two Singalese 
deputies are both dead. You see, 
sir, although before the war there 
were hundreds of MT officers 
who could control routine matter 
transmission, the security meas- 
ures which were taken at the 
beginning of the war didn’t stop 
at brain locks keyed to a single 
Gatekeeper. The method of oper- 
ation was changed so that at any 
one time only the Gatekeeper 
and his two deputies know how 
to operate the controls. And of 
course only the Gatekeeper him- 
self can — ” 



32 



GALAXY 



“I see, I see. So you think 
Singal’s offer is genuine?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

A ND two days later, even be- 
fore the peace was official, 
Hugh and Alice Hawkins left 
for Newlyon — by spaceship. 

In their private lounge in the 
ship, Hugh put his arm round her 
tenderly, being careful not to 
touch her wounds. Nevertheless, 
he felt something, or rather, the 
absence of something, and looked 
down at her accusingly. 

“You’ve taken off the band- 
ages,” he said. “They should still 
be on.” 

“I know, honey, but with a 
figure like mine is it fair to spoil 
it with bandages?” 

She sounded like herself again. 
“What are you thinking?” she 
asked presently. “If anything.” 
“About Chet. He was always 
afraid he’d fail if he was ever 
really tested. Well, he didn’t.” 
“He saved us,” said Alice 
quietly. “You weren’t going to 
send it through, were you?” 

“Of course not.” 

She nodded. “I knew you only 
promised to stop them ...” She 
shuddered uncontrollably for a 
moment, then went on bravely: 
“Anyway, Chet saved us.” 

“He saved more than us, darl- 
ing. He saved Moka and Singal.” 
“How do you make that out?” 
Hugh was silent for a moment 



before replying. Then he said: 
“This is the first time that any 
two powers fighting a war have 
ever admitted that there’s any- 
thing more important than their 
war. Chet and I both felt that 
was a great concession. That was 
one reason why we couldn’t let 
the Gate agreement be broken. 
Chet’s death was the final straw.” 
“How?” 

“It showed that security didn’t 
work and that one of these things 
had to happen. One, some Gate- 
keeper wouldn’t be such a hero 
as Chet and the Gate would be 
used as a weapon of war. Two, 
the Gate would have to be de- 
stroyed. Three, Moka and Singal 
would have to make peace. Well, 
the two worlds decided they 
didn’t want One or Two to hap- 
pen. So there was only Three 
left.” 

Alice stirred a little as her 
wounds itched. “Now there won’t 
be any more Gatekeepers. You’re 
Chief MTO from now on. A pity. 
There isn’t much glamor in that 
title.” 

“Hell, didn’t I tell you, honey? 
They’re giving me a courtesy 
title. Poor Chet gets posthumous 
medals from both Moka and Sin- 
gal. But I didn’t die, so I get a 
courtesy title instead. They in- 
vented it just for me.” 

“What is it, darling?” 

“The Last Gatekeeper.”

He came from the water system — and could have flooded Earth 



OCHINVAR — the spel- 
ling is only approximate 
stuck his head up 
through the sink drain. It was a 
good thing Franny had left the 
basket stopper out of the drain; 
he would never have been able 
to lift such a heavy weight. 

He listened. His round, intelli- 
gent eyes were bright with 
curiosity. After a moment he 
expanded the frilly lettuce-green 
crest on the top of his head that 
was his organ for distance 
thought perception. He listened 
with it too, cocking his head 
thoughtfully from time to time. 
He did hope this was going to 
be a nice place. No quarreling 
or harsh words. 

The atmosphere of the kitchen 
— freshly baked cherry pie — 
seemed to reassure him. He put 
his tiny paws on the edge of the 
drain hole and levered his 
limber, celery-talk body up on 
the porcelain. It took him a long 
time. 

At last he was out. Out, and 
hungry. The cherry pie, cooling 
on the counter opposite him, 
smelled delicious. But his 
thought organ (Lochinvar was 
an extremely sensitive receiver, 
too sensitive for his own comfort, 
but he couldn’t send at all), and 

with something beyond belief. * he ^ttuce frill on the top. of his 

head picked up ideas of “Pre- 
cious” and “Taboo” from the 
cherry pie. He wasn’t, after all, 

35 



intolerably hungry and he didn’t 
want to antagonize anybody. 
He’d wait. 

He bunched his four neat little 
paws under him, let his under- 
curved frondy tail hang down 
into the sink, and composed him- 
self for a nice nap on the rim of 
the drainboard. He liked the 
smooth, soft feel of its monel- 
metal surface. He slept. 

Franny, coming in about five 
to start supper, found him still 
sleeping there. She gave a star- 
tled yip. 

Don, in the living room, heard 
her. He and Franny had been 
married nearly five years, but he 
was still a little silly about his 
wife and probably always would 
be. He came running in. 

“What is it, kid?” 

“There on the drainboard.” 
She pointed. “A little green 
thing.” 

T'fcON GAVE her a reassuring 
squeeze and then bent over 
to look where she was pointing. 
“It’s a — ” he said, and stopped. 
“I don’t know what it is,” he 
confessed. “I thought it was 
some sort of lizard, but it’s 
shaped more like a sea horse. It 
doesn’t look dangerous, anyhow.” 

Lochinvar had opened his 
agate eyes and was looking at 
them. Not for the first time, he 
wished he had vocal cords. He 
hoped they wouldn’t get scared 



and start poking at him. Fear 
wasn’t as unpleasant for him to 
receive as anger and hostility, 
but it was bad enough. 

“It’s sort of cute,” Franny said 
after a while. “Those little feet 
and those big bright eyes and 
the way its tail hangs down. It 
seems friendly somehow. Where 
do you suppose it came from, 
Don?” 

“I can’t imagine. Or what it 
is, for that matter. But, as you 
say, it’s cute.” 

Franny was still studying 
Lochinvar. Rather nervously she 
held out one hand to him. 

Lochinvar twitched his tail. 
Then he gathered his muscles, 
jumped, and landed accurately 
on Franny’s forefinger. He clung 
there, using his frondy tail to 
balance with. 

“Be careful!” Don warned. “It 
might sting you.” 

“Oh, no. You can’t imagine 
how gently he’s holding on with 
those little bits of paws. Do you 
suppose he’d like something to 
eat?” 

“I expect so, but what? Too 
bad he can’t indicate his food 
preferences.” 

Lochinvar had been waiting 
for just such an invitation. He 
hopped off Franny’s finger, 
humped up his back, and took 
a long, long leap across the 
kitchen to beside the cherry pie. 
He looked up at them inquiringly. 



36 



GALAXY 



Don’s jaw dropped. “He un- 
derstood me!” 

“He wants some of the pie, 
Don.” 

“That was for my supper,” 
Don said. “I’ve been asking you 
for weeks to make a cherry pie.” 

“Oh, he’ll only eat a tiny 
piece.” 

While her husband looked on 
reproachfully, she cut a sliver of 
the pie and put it on a saucer. 
Lochinvar ate daintily, partly 
nibbling, partly licking, like a 
cat, with his delicate golden 
tongue. When he had finished, 
he hopped on Franny’s hand 
again. 

She stroked his head with one 
fingertip. Her blue eyes were 
bright with pleasure. “Why, he’s 
covered with fur!” she said, sur- 
prised. “That green stuff is as 
soft as silk.” 

“I wonder where he came 
from,” Don said. 

* * * 

THE MARTIAN ambassador, 
whose visit to Terra was a secret 
known only to three top-level 
people, was noticeably worried 
and distraught. 

T>Y THE end of the next day, 
Lochinvar had made himself 
quite at home in the Vennor 
household. Under the sobriquet 
of Boopus, he sat on Franny’s 
shoulder as she did her house- 
work, partook daintily of a 



French apple pie, and appeared 
to listen attentively to the base- 
ball news on the radio when Don 
tuned it in. 

“He’s the nicest pet we ever 

had,” Franny said. 

“Um-hum. Practically human, 
and better-looking than most 
human beings. Besides being a 
Giant fan. Listen, kid — ” 

“Well?” 

“About that motorboat — I’ve 
been thinking, and I can’t see 
why we have to wait any longer 
for it.” 

Franny’s ordinarily smooth 
brow contracted in a frown. 
“Don, we just can’t afford it 
now. We’ve been over this a 
dozen times.” 

“Why can’t we afford it? It 
only means borrowing a little 
more money. What am I living 
for?” 

Their voices had begun to rise. 
Lochinvar looked from Don to 
Franny anxiously. Were they 
going to have a quarrel? He 
hated it so. 

“Borrow more money? I want 
you to have what you want, Don. 
But this isn’t reasonable.” 

“Damn it, Franny, you’re not 
being reasonable yourself. I — ” 

Lochinvar felt quite desperate. 

He must stop them. He jumped 
up and down a couple of times 
on Franny’s shoulder, to attract 
her attention, and then made a 
valiant attempt to jump across 



LOCHINVAR

to Don and repeat the perform- 
ance. He misjudged the distance. 
He landed with an audible thud 
on the carpet. 

Franny and her husband both 
hurried to pick him up. As they 
stooped simultaneously, their 
heads bumped together. The 
next minute they were in each 
other’s arms. 

“Is Boopus hurt? . Go ahead 
and get the boat, Don. It isn’t 
worth fighting about.” 

J“No, he’s okay . I can wait 
for the boat, Franny.” 

“We’ll go shopping for it the 
middle of next month. I promise, 
Don. By then the payments for 
the trip we took to Tahiti will 
be out of the way . Are you 
sure he’s all right?” 

“I think so.” Don was probing 
Lochinvar’s tiny person care- 
fully. “He weighs so little that a 
fall’s not serious for him, the 
way it would be for a larger 
creature. Besides, he doesn’t act 
hurt.” 

This was true enough. Lochin- 
var, who was feeling extremely 
relieved, had hopped on to 
Franny’s hand and was looking 
at them with his usual expres- 
sion of lovable, amiable intelli- 
gence. 

“He’s so cute!” Franny said, 
delighted. She added, in one of 
the understatements of the ages, 
“He doesn’t like it when we 
quarrel.” 



T HERE IS no tongue, among 
all the languages of the 
Galaxy, better suited to the ex- 
pression of deadly, elaborate, 
ceremonious insult than High 
Martian. The messages that Ivvy, 
the Martian ambassador, was get- 
ting from home were so lethally 
expressive that they made him 
turn pale and blink his eyes. 
None the less, what he had to 
do was so distasteful that he put 
it off for nearly a day longer. At 
last he forced himself to the un- 
avoidable interview with the 
head of the UNBI. 

When the UNBI chief realized 
that Ivvy was serious, he acted. 
Agents went out. People were 
interviewed. Trails were fol- 
lowed. And ads appeared in the 
papers. 

* * * 

“IT’S CERTAINLY our Boop- 
us,” Franny said. She read aloud, 
“Lost, on July 25th near the 
spaceport, exotic small green 
animal with brown eyes. Bushy 
tail. Very attractive and intelli- 
gent. Will finder please call KY 
7-0001 immediately? Extremely 
liberal reward.” 

“That ad must have cost a 
lot,” Don said. “It’s a display ad, 
not in the ordinary lost and 
found. Somebody wants Boopus 
back badly.” He moved toward 
the phone on the table. 

“What are you going to do?” 
Franny asked. 



38

if) 

“Call the number, of course.” 

“Wait.” She put out her hand. 
“I don’t want to give him up.” 

“For a big reward? Franny, 
you mustn’t be unreasonable!” 

“What could we buy with the 
money that would be as nice as 
he is?” 

“Um. Well, he is a Giant fan. 
But we can’t just keep him, when 
his owner wants him back. That 
would be stealing.” 

“Would it? I don’t think any- 
one who’s as careless as the 
owner must be deserves to have 
him. He’d never have got lost, if 
his owner had taken proper care 
of him.” 

“Well ...” Don said inde- 
cisively. 

The crest on Lochinvar’s head 
was vibrating furiously. These 
people liked him and didn’t want 
to give him up. Fine. He liked 
them too. But they’d quarreled 
once before, and he’d barely been 
able to stop them. If they quar- 
reled again, anything might hap- 
pen. He wouldn’t be able to help 
himself. 

Lochinvar had no vocal cords, 
but in moments of intense emo- 
tion he was able to swallow air 
and emit a grumbling noise. He 
did this now. 

When he saw that Franny and 
Don were both looking at him, 
he hopped over to the phone and 
sat down on it. Once more he 
made the grumbling noise. 



Franny sighed. She ran one 
hand unhappily through her long 
blonde hair. “Go ahead and call,” 
she said. “He wants you to.” 

TVVY, IN A limousine driven 
by a grim-faced UNBI man, 
arrived somewhat later. His eyes 
were anxious and his lips, as he 
pressed the front door buzzer, 
were white. Nobody knew better 
than he what Lochinvar’s pos- 
sibilities were — possibilities 
that, for all their comic aspects, 
were apt to end tragically. 

Franny opened the door. 
“ ’Lo,” she said muzzily. “Nize 
day.” She giggled. “You the man 
about the ad?” 

What Ivvy had been afraid 
would happen obviously had 
been happening. Fortunately, it 
didn’t seem to have gone very 
far. “Y es, I have come for the 
little animal,” he answered. “Do 
I see him on your shoulder?” 
“Sure,” Franny answered. 
“Boopus.” She lowered her voice 
confidentially. “He’s all stiff.” 
“Oh, my,” said Ivvy. That 
must mean Lochinvar had been 
rebroadcasting for quite a while. 
“Oh, dear.” 

He produced a transparent 
globe that looked like plastic but 
was, in actual fact, made of 
kaointh — a word that, in 
Martian, means “impervious to 
neural force.” 

“Excuse me,” he said to 



LOCHINVAR 



39 



Franny. A little unsteadily — 
for by now Ivvy was feeling the 
effect of Lochinvar’s involuntary 
transmission himself — he 
reached across to the girl, 
plucked Lochinvar from her 
shoulder, and dropped him ten- 
derly through the opening in the 
kaointh globe. He closed the 
opening. 

He drew a long breath. “Ah,” 
he said, “I am finally much re- 
lieved.” 

Franny had been watching 
vacantly. Now she rubbed one 
hand over her face. “Relieved? 
Oh, I see. You were afraid some- 
body might hurt him. I see.” 

She didn’t see at all, but Ivvy 
found no reason for enlightening 
her. He followed her into the 
living room, holding the kaointh 
globe. He put the globe down 
on the cocktail table and began 
shelling out what was, precisely 
as the ad had said, an extremely 
liberal reward. 

Don had been sitting on the 
floor, looking bewilderedly at an 
unsteady tower he had appar- 
ently been building out of domi- 
noes. Now he scrambled to his 
feet and shut the radio off. 

Ivvy began putting the money 
in his hand. Don accepted with- 
out enthusiasm. He had liked 
Lochinvar and he felt, just as 
Franny did, that there was 
something odd and unsatisfac- 
tory about the transaction. 



“How did the animal happen 
to get lost?” he asked. 

Ivvy’s plump lips worked, but 
no sound came out. What point 
was there in relating to these 
Earth people the series of fan- 
tastic mishaps that had ended in 
Lochinvar’s getting out of his 
protective case and being drop- 
ped into one of the city’s res- 
ervoirs as Ivvy and his VIP 
hosts chanced to fly over it in a 
’copter? 

“He got into the water system 
by mistake,” he said at last. 
“Oh.” 

Ivvy put his wallet away. 
“You were listening to the 
radio?” he asked. 

“Yes.” Don’s good-humored 
face grew sour. “Giants are los- 
ing again,” he said bitterly. 
“Every year they start out fine, 
every year they manage to foul 
it up. Makes my blood really 
boil.” 

Ivvy nodded. What had hap- 
pened was obvious. This Earth- 
man’s angry thoughts had grown 
too much for Lochinvar to ab- 
sorb, and the wretched animal 
had begun re-emitting them in- 
voluntarily. 

Fortunately Ivvy had arrived 
in time. 

¥TE MOVED toward the door. 

Franny followed him. “He 
was the nicest pet we ever 
had,” she said wistfully. “We 



40 



GALAXY 



hate to let him go. You’ll be 
good to him?” 

Once more the ambassador’s 
face worked. This woman didn’t 
realize — and, if he had his way, 
never would realize — that she 
and her husband had been har- 
boring one of the fabulous Gryna 
animals. 

The Gryna animal’s peculiar 
mental abilities run like a parti- 
colored thread through Martian 
history. Time and again whole 
cities have been betrayed to the 
enemy by the surreptitious con- 
veying of a Gryna, minus its 
protective case, into their cita- 
dels. The animal itself is harm- 
less, well-meaning and intelligent. 
But when it receives a certain 
quantum of hostile thought 
impulses from the human around 
it, it involuntarily re-emits them. 
It re-emits them transformed 
into a monumental, paralyzing 
euphoria. 

The firsf stages of this are not 
so bad — rather like the happy 
phase of a drinking bout. Franny 
and Don had been at this stage 
when Ivvy came for Lochinvar. 
It is a stage of muzziness and 
block-building. But as the eupho- 
ria continues, it grows dangerous. 
Those within the radius of its 
effects are capable of walking off 



a cliff to see what is at the bot- 
tom, or putting their hands into 
a glowing furnace to pat the 
pretty flames. And a beleaguered 
city will open its gates to its 
enemies, saying happily, “Do 
come in.” 

“I said we hate to let him go,” 
Franny repeated a little insis- 
tently. “He has such a gentle 
nature. He hated it when we 
quarreled.” 

Ivvy licked his lips. He 
thought of the incredulity that 
had come into the UNBI chiefs 
face when Ivvy had tried to tell 
him that Lochinvar was an or- 
dinary precaution of Martian 
diplomacy. He thought of the 
worsening of high-level Mars- 
Terra relations that was bound 
to result. He thought of what 
would have happened if Lochin- 
var had received enough hostile 
thoughts to get him really going 
before Ivvy reclaimed him. He 
thought of his own blasted career 
as a diplomat. 

But the code of Martian po- 
liteness is a compelling one. Ivvy 
forced his stiff face into a smile. 
“Yes, I’ll be kind to him,” he 
told Franny truthfully. “As you 
say, he responds badly to harsh 
words.”

The sand-thing was powerful, 
lonely and strange. No doubt 
it was a god — but who wasn't? 



By BILL 

S TINSON lay still in the 
sand where he fell, gloat- 
ing over the success of his 
arrival. 

He touched the pencil-line 
scar behind his ear where the 
cylinder was buried, marveling 
at the power stored there, power 
to fling him from earth to this 
fourth planet of the Centaurian 
system in an instant. It had hap- 
pened so fast that he could al- 



DOEDE Illustrated by IVIE 

most feel the warm, humid Mis- 
souri air, though he was light 
years from Missouri. 

He got up. A gray, funnel- 
shaped cloud of dust stood off 
to his left. This became disturb- 
ing, since there was scarcely 
enough wind to move his hair. He 
watched it, trying to recall what 
he might know about cyclones. 
But he knew little. Weather con- 
trol made cyclones and other cli- 



matic phenomena on earth prac- 
tically non-existent. The cloud 
did not move, though, except to 
spin on its axis rapidly, emitting a 
high-pitched, scarcely audible 
whine, like a high speed motor. 
He judged it harmless. 

He stood on a wide valley 
floor between two mountain 
ranges. Dark clouds capped one 
peak of the mountains on his left. 
The sky was deep blue. 



He tested the gravity by jump- 
ing up and down. Same as Earth 
gravity. The sun — no, not the 
sun. Not Sol. What should he call 
it, Alpha or Centaurus? Well, 
perhaps neither. He was here and 
Earth was somewhere up there. 
This was the sun of this particu- 
lar solar system. He was right the 
first time. 

The sun burned fiercely, al- 
though he would have said it was 



42 



GALAXY 



THE GOD NEXT DOOR 



43 




about four o’clock in the after- 
noon, if this had been Earth. Not 
a tree, nor a bush, nor even a 
wisp of dry grass was in sight. 
Everywhere was desert. 

The funnel of sand had moved 
closer and while he watched it, 
it seemed to drift in the wind — 
although there was no wind, Stin- 
son backed away. It stopped. It 
was about ten feet tall by three 
feet in diameter at the base. Then 
Stinson backed away again. It 
was changing. Now it became a 
blue rectangle, then a red cube, 
a violet sphere. 

He wanted to run. He wished 
Benjamin were here. Ben might 
have an explanation. “What am 
I afraid of?” he said aloud, “a 
few grains of sand blowing in 
the wind? A wind devil?” 

He turned his back and walk- 
ed away. When he looked up the 
wind devil was there before him. 
He looked back. Only one. It had 
moved. The sun shone obliquely, 
throwing Stinson’s shadow upon 
the sand. The wind devil also 
had a shadow, although the sun 
shone through it and the shadow 
was faint. But it moved when the 
funnel moved. This was no illu- 
sion. 

Again Stinson felt the urge to 
run, or to use the cylinder to pro- 
ject himself somewhere else, but 
he said, “No!” very firmly to him- 
self. He was here to investigate, 
to determine if this planet was 



capable of supporting life. 

Life? Intelligence? He exam- 
ined the wind devil as closely as 
he dared, but it was composed 
only of grains of sand. There was 
no core, no central place you 
could point to and say, here is 
the brain, or the nervous system. 
But then, how could a group of 
loosely spaced grains of sand 
possibly have a nervous system? 

It was again going through its 
paces. Triangle, cube, rectangle, 
sphere. He watched, and when it 
became a triangle again, he 
smoothed a place in the sand and 
drew a triangle with his fore- 
finger. When it changed to a cube 
he drew a square, a circle for a 
sphere, and so on. When the 
symbols were repeated he point- 
ed to each in turn, excitement 
mounting. He became so ab- 
sorbed in doing this that he 
failed to notice how the wind 
devil drew closer and closer, but 
when he inhaled the first grains 
of sand, the realization of what 
was happening dawned with a 
flash of fear. Instantly he pro- 
jected himself a thousand miles 
away. 

lVTOW he was in an area of pro- 
■*- ” fuse vegetation. It was twi- 
light. As he stood beside a small 
creek, a chill wind blew from the 
northwest. He wanted to cover 
himself with the long leaves he 
found, but they were dry and 



44 



GALAXY 



brittle, for here autumn had 
turned the leaves. Night would 
be cold. 

He was not a woodsman. He 
doubted if he could build a fire 
without matches. So he followed 
the creek to where it flowed be- 
tween two great hills. Steam 
vapors rose from a crevice. A 
cave was nearby and warm air 
flowed from its mouth. He went 
inside. 

At first he thought the cave 
was small, but found instead that 
he was in a long narrow passage- 
way. The current of warm air 
flowed toward him and he fol- 
lowed it, cautiously, stepping 
carefully and slowly. Then it was 
not quite so dark. Soon he 
stepped out of the narrow pas- 
sageway into a great cavern with 
a high-vaulted ceiling. 

The light source was a mys- 
tery. He left no shadow on the 
floor. A great crystal sphere hung 
from the ceiling, and he was 
curious about its purpose, but a 
great pool of steaming water in 
the center of the cavern drew his 
attention. He went close, to warm 
himself. A stone wall surrounding 
the pool was inscribed with in- 
tricate art work and indecipher- 
able symbols. 

Life. Intelligence. The planet 
was inhabited. 

Should he give up and return 
to earth? Or was there room here 
for his people? Warming his 



hands there over the great steam- 
ing pool he thought of Benjamin, 
and Straus, and Jamieson — all 
those to whom he had given 
cylinders, and who were now 
struggling for life against those 
who desired them. 

He decided it would not be 
just, to give up so easily. 

The wide plaza between the 
pool and cavern wall was smooth 
as polished glass. Statues lined 
the wall. He examined them. 

The unknown artist had been 
clever. From one angle they were 
animals, from another birds, from 
a third they were vaguely hu- 
manoid creatures, glowering at 
him with primitive ferocity. The 
fourth view was so shocking he 
had to turn away quickly. No 
definable form or sculptured line 
was visible, yet he felt, or saw — 
he did not know which senses 
told him — the immeasurable gulf 
of a million years of painful 
evolution. Then nothing. It was 
not a curtain drawn to prevent 
him from seeing more. 

There was no more. 

TTE stumbled toward the pool’s 
wall and clutched for sup- 
port, but his knees buckled. His 
hand slid down the wall, over the 
ancient inscriptions. He sank to 
the floor. Before he lost con- 
sciousness he wondered, fleet- 
ingly, if a lethal instrument was 
in the statue. 



THE GOD NEXT DOOR 



45 



He woke with a ringing in his 
ears, feeling drugged and sluggish. 
Sounds came to him. He opened 
his eyes. 

The cavern was crowded. 
These creatures were not only 
humanoid, but definitely human, 
although more slight of build 
than earth people. The only dif- 
ference he could see at first sight 
was that they had webbed feet. 
All were dressed from the waist 
down only, in a shimmering skirt 
that sparkled as they moved. 
They walked with the grace of 
ballet dancers, moving about the 
plaza, conversing in a musical 
language with no meaning for 
Stinson. The men were dark- 
skinned, the women somewhat 
lighter, with long flowing hair, 
wide lips and a beauty that was 
utterly sensual. 

He was in chains! They were 
small chains, light weight, of a 
metal that looked like aluminum. 
But all his strength could not 
break them. 

They saw him struggling. Two 
of the men came over and spoke 
to him in the musical language. 

“My name is Stinson,” he said, 
pointing to himself. “I’m from the 
planet Earth.” 

They looked at each other and 
jabbered some more. 

“Look,” he said, “Earth. 
E-A-R-T-H, Earth.” He pointed 
upward, described a large circle, 
then another smaller, and show- 



ed how Earth revolved around 
the sun. 

One of the men poked him 
with a stick, or tube of softie 
kind. It did not hurt, but angered 
him. He left the chains by his 
own method of travel, and reap- 
peared behind the two men. They 
stared at the place where he had 
been. The chains tinkled music- 
ally. He grasped the shoulder of 
the offender, spun him around 
and slapped his face. 

A cry of consternation rose 
from the group, echoing in the 
high ceilinged cavern. “SBTL!” it 
said, “ZBTL . XBTL . zbtl.” 

The men instantly prostrated 
themselves before him. The one 
who had poked Stinson with the 
stick rose, and handed it to him. 
Still angered, Stinson grasped it 
firmly, with half a notion to break 
it over his head. As he did so, 
a flash of blue fire sprang from 
it. The man disappeared. A small 
cloud of dust settled slowly to 
the floor. 

Disintegrated! 

Stinson’s face drained pale, 
and suddenly, unaccountably, he 
was ashamed because he had no 
clothes. 

“I didn’t mean to kill him!” he 
cried. “I was angry, and . 

Useless. They could not un- 
derstand. For all he knew, they 
might think he was threatening 
them. The object he had thought 
of as a stick was in reality a 



46 



GALAXY 



long metal tube, precisely ma- 
chined, with a small button near 
one end. 

This weapon was completely 
out of place in a culture such as 
this. Or was it? What did he 
know of these people? Very 
little. They were humanoid. They 
had exhibited human emotions 
of anger, fear and, that most 
human of all characteristics, 
curiosity. But up to now the tube 
and the chain was the only evi- 
dence of an advanced technology, 
unless the ancient inscriptions in 
the stone wall of the pool, and 
the statues lining the wall were 
evidences. 

fT'HERE was a stirring among 
the crowd. An object like a 
pallet was brought, carried by 
four of the women. They laid it 
at his feet, and gestured for him 
to sit. He touched it cautiously, 
then sat. 

Instantly he sprang to his feet. 
There, at the cavern entrance, the 
wind devil writhed and undulated 
in a brilliant harmony of colors. 
It remained in one spot, though, 
and he relaxed somewhat. 

One of the women came to- 
ward him, long golden hair flow- 
ing, firm breasts dipping slightly 
at each step. Her eyes held a 
language all their own, universal. 
She pressed her body against him 
and bore him to the paflet, her 
kisses fire on his face. 

THE GOD NEXT DOOR 



Incongruously, he thought of 
Benjamin back on earth, and all 
the others with cylinders, who 
might be fighting for their lives 
at this moment. He pushed her 
roughly aside. 

She spoke, and he understood! 
Her words were still the same 
gibberish, but now he knew their 
meaning. Somehow he knew also 
that the wind devil was respon- 
sible for his understanding. 

“You do not want me?” she 
said sadly. “Then kill me.” 

“Why should I kill you?” 

She shrugged her beautiful 
shoulders. “It is the way of the 
Gods,” she said. “IT you do not, 
then the others will.” 

He took the tube-weapon in 
his hands, careful not to touch 
the button. “Don’t be afraid. I 
didn’t mean to kill the man. It 
was an accident. I will psptect 
you.” 

She shook her head. “One day 
they will find me alone, and 
they’ll kill me.” 

“Why?” 

She shrugged. “I have not 
pleased you.” 

“On the contrary, you have. 
There is a time and place for 
everything, though.” 

Suddenly a great voice sound- 
ed in the cavern, a voice with no 
direction. It came from the 
ceiling, the floor, the walls, the 
steaming pool. It was in the 
language of the web-footed people; 



47 



it was in his own tongue. “No 
harm must come to this woman. 
The God with fingers on his feet 
has decreed this.” 

Those in the cavern looked at 
the woman with fear and respect. 
She kissed Stinson’s feet. Two of 
the men came and gave her a 
brilliant new skirt. She smiled at 
him, and he thought he had never 
seen a more beautiful face. 

nHHE GREAT, bodiless voice 
sounded again, but those in 
the cavern went about their ac- 
tivities. They did not hear. 

“Who are you?” 

Stinson looked at the wind 
devil, since it could be no one 
else speaking, and pointed to 
himself. “Me?” 

“Yes.” 

“I am Stinson, of the planet 
Earth.” 

“Yes, I see it in your mind, 
now. You want to live here, on 
this planet.” 

“Then you must know where 
I came from, and how.” 

“I do not understand how. You 
have a body, a physical body 
composed of atoms. It is impos- 
sible to move a physical body 
from one place to another by a 
mere thought and a tiny instru- 
ment, yet you have done so. You 
deserted me out in the desert.” 
“I deserted you?” Stinson cried 
angrily, “You tried to kill me!” 
“I was attempting communica- 

48 









tion. Why should I kill you?” 
He was silent a moment, look- 
ing at the people in the cavern. 
“Perhaps because you feared I 
would become the God of these 
people in your place.” 

Stinson felt a mental shrug. “It 
is of no importance. When they 
arrived on this planet I attempted 
to explain that I was not a God, 
but the primitive is not deeply 
buried in them. They soon 
resorted to emotion rather than 
reason. It is of no importance.” 
“I’d hardly call them primitive, 
with such weapons.” 

“The tube is not of their tech- 
nology. That is, they did not 
make it directly. These are the 
undersirables, the incorrigibles, 
the nonconformists from the sixth 
planet. I permit them here be- 
cause it occupies my time, to 
watch them evolve.” 

“You should live so long.” 
“Live?” the wind devil said. 
“Oh, I see your meaning. I’d 
almost forgotten. You are a 
strange entity. You travel by a 
means even I cannot fully un- 
derstand, yet you speak of time 
as if some event were about to 
take place. I believe you think 
of death. I see your physical body 
has deteriorated since yesterday. 
Your body will cease to exist, 
almost as soon as those of the 
sixth planet peoples. I am most 
interested in you. You will bring 
your people, and live here.” 



“I haven’t decided. There are 
these web-footed people, who 
were hostile until they thought I 
was a God. They have destruc- 
tive weapons. Also, I don’t un- 
derstand you. I see you as a cone 
of sand which keeps changing 
color and configuration. Is it your 
body? Where do you come from? 
Is this planet populated with your 
kind?” 

The wind devil hesitated. 

“Where do I originate? It 
seems I have always been. You 
see this cavern, the heated pool, 
the statues, the inscriptions. Half 
a million years ago my people 
were as you. That is, they lived 
in physical bodies. Our techno- 
logy surpassed any you have seen. 
The tube these webfoots use is a 
toy by comparison. Our scien- 
tists found the ultimate nature 
of physical law. They learned to 
separate the mind from the body. 
Then my people set a date. Our 
entire race was determined to 
free itself from the confines of 
the body. The date came.” 

“What happened?” 

“I do not know. I alone exist. 
I have searched all the levels of 
time and matter from the very 
beginning. My people are gone. 
Sometimes it almost comes to 
me, why they are gone. And this 
is contrary to the greatest law 
of all — that an entity, once in 
existence, can never cease to 
exist.”

GALAXY 



S TINSON was silent, thinking 
of the endless years of search- 
ing through the great gulf of 
time. His eyes caught sight of 
the woman, reclining now on the 
pallet. The men had left her and 
stood in groups, talking, glancing 
at him, apparently free of their 
awe and fear already. 

The woman looked at him, and 
she was not smiling. “Please ask 
the Sand God,” she said, “to 
speak to my people again. Their 
fear of him does not last. When 
He is gone they will probably 
kill us.” 

“As for the webfoots,” the 
wind devil, or Sand God, said, “I 
will destroy them. You and your 
people will have the entire 
planet.” 

“Destroy them?” Stinson ask- 
ed, incredulously, “all these 
people? They have a right to 
live like any one else.” 

“Right? What is it — ‘right?’ 
They are entities. They exist, 
therefore they always will. My 
people are the only entities who 
ever died. To kill the body is 
unimportant.” 

“No. You misunderstand. 
Listen, you spoke of the greatest 
law. Your law is a scientific 
hypothesis. It has to do with 
what comes after physical exist- 
ence, not with existence itself. 
The greatest law is this, that an 
entity, once existing, must not be 
harmed in any way. To do so 



changes the most basic structure 
of nature.” 

The Sand God did not reply. 
The great bodiless, directionless 
voice was silent, and Stinton felt 
as if he had been taken from 
some high place and set down 
in a dark canyon. The cone of 
sand was the color of wood ashes. 
It pulsed erratically, like a great 
heart missing a beat now and 
then. The web-footed people 
milled about restlessly. The 
woman’s eyes pleaded. 

When he looked back, the 
Sand God was gone. 

Instantly a new note rose in 
the cavern. The murmur of un- 
mistakable mob fury ran over the 
webfoots. Several of the men ap- 
proached the woman with hatred 
in their voices. He could not un- 
derstand the words now. 

But he understood her. 
“They’ll kill me!” she cried. 

Stinson pointed the disintegrat- 
ing weapon at them and yelled. 
They dropped back. “We’ll have 
to get outside,” he told her. “This 
mob will soon get out of hand. 
Then the tube won’t stop them. 
They will rush in. I can’t kill 
them all at once, even if I wanted 
to. And I don’t.” 

Together they edged toward 
the cavern entrance, ran quickly 
up the inclined passageway, and 
came out into crisp, cold air. 
The morning sun was reflected 
from a million tiny mirrors on 



THE GO D NEXT DOOR

the rocks, the trees and grass. A 
silver thaw during the night had 
covered the whole area with a 
coating of ice. Stinson shivered. 
The woman handed him a skirt 
she had thoughtfully brought 
along from the cavern. He took it, 
and they ran down the slippery 
path leading away from the en- 
trance. From the hiding place 
behind a large rock they watched, 
as several web-footed men emerg- 
ed into the sunlight. They 
blinked, covered their eyes, and 
jabbered musically among them- 
selves. One slipped and fell on 
the ice. They re-entered the cave. 

CTINSON donned the shim- 
^ mering skirt, smiling as he did 
so. The others should see him 
now. Benjamin and Straus and 
Jamieson. They would laugh. 
And Ben’s wife, Lisa, she would 
give her little-girl laugh, and 
probably help him fasten the 
skirt. It had a string, like a to- 
bacco pouch, which was tied 
around the waist. It helped keep 
him warm. 

He turned to the woman. “I 
don’t know what I’ll do with you, 
but now that we’re in trouble to- 
gether, we may as well introduce 
ourselves. My name is Stinson.” 

“I am Sybtl,” she said. 

“Syb-tl.” He tried to imitate 
her musical pronunciation. “A 
very nice name.” 

She smiled, then pointed to 



the cavern. “When the ice is gone, 
they will come out and follow 
us.” 

“We’d better make tracks.” 
“No,” she said, “we must run, 
and make no tracks.” 

“Okay, Sis,” he said. 

“Sis?” 

“That means, sister.” 

“I am not your sister. I am 
your wife.” 

“What?” 

“Yes. When a man protects a 
woman from harm, it is a sign to 
all that she is his chosen. Other- 
wise, why not let her die? You 
are a strange God.” 

“Listen, Sybtl,” he said desper- 
ately, “I am not a God and you 
are not my wife. Let’s get that 
straight.” 

“But . .” 

“No buts. Right now we’d 
better get out of here.” 

He took her hand and they 
ran, slid, fell, picked themselves 
up again, and ran. He doubted 
the wisdom of keeping her with 
him. Alone, the webfoots were no 
match for him. He could travel 
instantly to ' any spot he chose. 
But with Sybtl it was another 
matter; he was no better than 
any other man, perhaps not so 
good as some because he was 
forty, and never had been an 
athlete. 

How was he to decide if this 
planet was suitable for his people, 
hampered by a woman, slinking 



52 



GALAXY 



through a frozen wilderness like 
an Indian? But the woman’s 
hand was soft. He felt strong 
knowing she depended on him. 

Anyway, he decided, pursuit 
was impossible. They left no 
tracks on the ice. They were safe, 
unless the webfoots possessed 
talents unknown to him. 

So they followed the path 
leading down from the rocks, 
along the creek with its tumbling 
water. Frozen, leafless willows 
clawed at their bodies. The sun 
shone fiercely in a cloudless sky. 
Already water ran in tiny rivulets 
over the ice. The woman steered 
him to the right, away from the 
creek. 

STINSON’S bare feet were 
numb from walking on ice. 
Christ, he thought, what am I 
doing here, anyway? He glanced 
down at Sybtl and remembered 
the webfoots. He stopped, tempt- 
ed to use his cylinder and move 
to a warmer, less dangerous spot. 

The woman pulled on his arm. 
“We must hurry!” 

He clutched the tube-weapon. 
“How many shots in this thing?” 
“Shots?” 

“How often can I use it?” 

“As often as you like. It is 
good for fifty years. Kaatr — he is 
the one you destroyed — brought 
it from the ship when we came. 
Many times he has used it un- 
wisely.” 



“When did you come?” 

“Ten years ago. I was a child.” 
“I thought only criminals were 
brought here.” 

She nodded. “Criminals, and 
their children.” 

“When will your people come 
again?” 

She shook her head. “Never. 
They are no longer my people. 
They have disowned us.” 

“And because of me even those 
in the cavern have disowned you.” 
Suddenly she stiffened beside 
him. There, directly in their path, 
stood the Sand God. It was blood 
red now. It pulsed violently. The 
great voice burst forth. 

“Leave the woman!” it de- 
manded angrily. “The webfoots 
are nearing your position.” 

“I cannot leave her. She is 
helpless against them.” 

“What form of primitive 
stupidity are you practicing now? 
Leave, or they will kill you.” 
Stinson shook his head. 

The Sand God pulsed more 
violently than before. Ice melted 
in a wide area around it. Brown, 
frozen grass burned to ashes. 

“You will allow them to kill 
you, just to defend her life? What 
business is it of yours if she 
lives or dies? My race discarded 
such primitive logic long before 
it reached your level of develop- 
ment.” 

“Yes,” Stinson said, “and your 
race no longer exists.” 



THE GOD NEXT DOOR 



53 



The Sand God became a 
sphere of blue flame. A wave of 
intense heat drove them back- 
ward. “Earthman,” the great 
voice said, “go back to your 
Earth. Take your inconsistencies 
with you. Do not come here again 
to infect my planet with your 
primitive ideas. The webfoots are 
not as intelligent as you, but they 
are sane. If you bring your people 
here, I shall destroy you all.” 

The sphere of blue fire scream- 
ed away across the frozen wil- 
derness, and the thunder of its 
passing shook the ground and 
echoed among the lonely hills. 

OYBTL shivered against his 
^ arm. “The Sand God is angry,” 
she said. “My people tell how he 
was angry once before, when we 
first came here. He killed half of 
us and burned the ship that 
brought us. That is how Kaatr 
got the tube-weapon. It was the 
only thing the Sand God didn’t 
burn, that and the skirts. Then, 
when he had burned the ship, the 
Sand God went to the sixth planet 
and burned two of the largest 
cities, as a warning that no more 
of us must come here.” 

Well, Stinson said to himself, 
that does it. We are hotter off on 
Earth. We can’t fight a monster 
like him. 

Sybtl touched his arm. “Why 
did the Sand God come? He did 
not speak.” 



“He spoke to me.” 

“I did not hear.” 

“Yes, I know now. His voice 
sounds like thunder in the sky, 
but it is a voice that speaks only 
in the mind. He said I must leave 
this planet.” 

She glanced at him with sud- 
denly awakened eyes, as if think- 
ing of it for the first time. “Where 
is your ship?” 

“I have no ship.” 

“Then he will kill you.” She 
touched her fingers on his face. 
“I am sorry. It was all £pr me.” 
“Don’t worry. The Sand God 
travels without a ship, why 
shouldn’t I?” 

“Now?” 

“As soon as you are safe. 
Come.” 

Steam rose from the burned 
area, charred like a rocket 
launching pit. They stepped 
around it carefully. Stinson felt 
warm air, but there was no time, 
now, to warm cold feet or dwell 
on the vagaries of Sand Gods. 

Together they crossed the 
narrow valley. Sybtl led him to- 
ward a tall mound of rock. Here 
they came to the creek again, 
which flowed into a small canyon. 
They climbed the canyon wall. 
Far away, small figures moved. 
The webfoots were on their trail. 

She drew him into a small 
cave. It was heated, like the 
great cavern, but held no walled 
pool nor mysterious lighting. But 



34 



GALAXY 



it was warm, and the small en- 
trance made an excellent van- 
tage point for warding off attack. 
“They will not find us . .” 

A high-pitched keening burst 
suddenly around them. Stinson 
knew they had heard, or felt the 
sound for some time, that now 
its frequency was in an audible 
range. 

“The Sand God,” Sybtl said. 
“Sometimes he plays among the 
clouds. He makes it rain in a 
dry summer, or sometimes warms 
the whole world for days at a 
time in winter, so the snow melts 
and the grass begins to green. 
Then he tires and lets winter 
come back again. He is the lone- 
liest God in the universe.” 

“What makes you think he’s 
lonely?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “I 
just know. But he’s an angry God 
now. See those clouds piling in 
the East? Soon they will hide 
the sun. Then he will make them 
churn and boil, like river whirl- 
pools in spring. At least he does 
this when he plays. Who knows 
what he will do when he’s angry?” 
“The Sand God isn’t doing 
this,” Stinson said. “It’s only a 
storm.” 

She covered his lips with her 
fingers. “Don’t say. that. He may 
hear you and be more angry.” 
“But it is, don’t you see? You 
give him powers he does not 
possess.” 



Sybtl shook her head and 
stroked his face with her long, 
slim fingers. “Poor little God- 
with-fingers-on-his-feet,” she said. 
“You do not understand. The 
Sand God is terrible, even when 
he plays. See the lightning? It is 
blue. The lightning of a storm 
that comes by itself is not blue. 
He is running around the world 
on feet like the rockets of space 
ships, and when he strikes the 
clouds, blue fire shoots awaf.” 

^T'HE CLOUDS continued to 
build on one another. Soon 
the blue flashes of lightning ex- 
tended across the sky from 
horizon to horizon. The earth 
trembled. Sybtl moved closer, 
trembling also. 

“He never did this before,” she 
said. “He never made the earth 
shake before.” 

Great boulders crashed down 
the canyon walls and dropped 
into the creek. They dared not 
move from the cave' although 
death seemed certain if they 
stayed. 

“I’ll leave for a moment,” he 
said. “I’ll be back soon.” 

“You’re leaving?” There was 
panic in her voice. 

“Only for a moment.” 

“And you won’t come back. 
You will go to your world.” 
“No. I’ll be back.” 

“Promise? No, don’t promise. 
The promises of Gods often are 



THE GOD NEXT DOOR 



55 



forgotten before the sounds die 
away.” 

“I’ll be back.” 

He disappeared at once, giving 
her no chance to object again, 
and went to the desert of sand, 
where he had first arrived on 
the planet. He wanted to see if 
the storm were world-wide. 

Stinson had never been in a 
sand storm before, even on Earth. 
He could not breathe. He could 
not see. Bullets of sand stung 
his skin. Bullets of sand shot 
into his eyes. Clouds of sand 
howled around him. He fell, and 
the wind rolled him over and 
over in the sand like a tumble- 
weed. The skirt flew up around 
hi$ face. He could not get up 
again. 

He returned to the cave. 

Soon after, while they sat 
huddled together, watching the 
chaos of tumbling rocks, lightning, 
and driving rain, the high-pitch- 
ed keening came again. A sphere 
of blue fire appeared in the east. 
Its brilliance put the lightning to 
shame. It bore down on the cave 
swiftly, purposefully. Stinson pre- 
pared himself to leave. In spite 
of his desire to protect Sybtl, it 
was useless to get himself killed 
when he was powerless to help 
her. But at the last moment it 
veered off. 

“Fiend!” Stinson screamed the 
word, vaguely marvelling at his 
own fury. 



The blue sphere turned and 
came back. 

“Monster!” 

Again. 

“Murderer!” 

“Adolescent!” 

This time it kept going. The 
rain and wind ceased. Lightning 
stopped. Thunder rumbled dis- 
tantly. Clouds disappeared. Stin- 
son and Sybtl emerged from the 
cave. 

There was no longer a ques- 
tion of attack from the webfoots, 
the storm had taken care of that. 
The fierce sun began its work of 
drying rocks and throwing shad- 
ows and coaxing life out into the 
open again. Down in the canyon 
a bird sang, a lonely, cheerful 
twitter. 

“The Sand God is tired,” Sybtl 
said. “He is not angry now. I’m 
glad. Perhaps he will let you 
stay." 

“No. Even if he allowed it, I 
couldn’t stay. My people could 
never live here with a God who 
is half devil.” 

nPHE CONE of sand suddenly 
appeared. It stood in the can- 
yon, its base on a level with the 
cave. It was quiet. It was dull 
gray in color. It exuded impres- 
sions of death, of hopeful words 
solemnly spoken over lowered 
coffins, of cold earth and cold 
space, of dank, wet catacombs, of 
creeping, crawling nether things. 



56 



GALAXY 



The bird’s twitter stopped 
abruptly. 

“Earthman,” the Sand God 
said, as if he were about to make 
a statement. 

Stinson ignored him. He 
glanced down at Sybtl, who 
sensed that this was a time for 
good-bys. He thought, perhaps I 
can stay here alone with her. The 
webfoots might find us, or the 
Sand God might destroy us in 
one of his fits, but it might be 
worth it. 

“Don’t go,” she said. “Not yet.” 
“Earthman, hear me.” 

“I hear you.” 

“Why does your mind shrink 
backward?” 

“I’ve decided not to bring my 
people here.” 

“You decided?” 

“Certainly,” Stinson said 
boldly. “Call it rationalization, 
if you wish. You ordered us away; 
and I have several good reasons 
for not coming here if the door 
was open.” 

“I’ve changed my mind. You 
will be welcomed.” 

“Listen to that, will you?” Stin- 
son said angrily. “Just listen! 
You set yourself up as a God for 
the webfoots. You get them eat- 
ing out of your hand. Then what 
do you do? You throw a fit. Yes, 
a fit! Like an adolescent. Worse.” 
“Earthman, wait . .” 

“No!” Stinson shot back. 
“You’ve owned this planet for a 



million years. You have brooded 
here alone since before my 
people discovered fire, and in all 
those ages you never learned self- 
control. I can’t subject my people 
to the whims of an entity who 
throws a planetary fit when it 
pleases him.” 

Stinson relaxed. He’d had his 
say. Sybtl trembled beside him. A 
small mammal, round, furry, hop- 
ped by, sniffing inquisitively. 

Sybtl said, “Is the Sand God 
happy?” She shook her head. 
“No, he is not happy. He is old, 
old, old. I can feel it, My people 
say that when one gets too old 
it is well to die. But Gods never 
die, do they? I would not like 
to be a God.” 

“Stinson,” the Sand God said. 
“You said I was adolescent. You 
are correct. Do you remember I 
told you how my people, the en- 
tire race, left their bodies at the 
same time? Do you imagine all 
of us were adults?” 

“I suppose not. Sounds reason- 
able. How old were you?” 

“Chronologically, by our stand- 
ards, I was nine years old.” 

“But you continued to develop 
after . .” 

“No.” 

QTINSON tried to imagine it. 
^ At first there must have been 
a single voice crying into a mon- 
strous emptiness, “Mother, where 
are you? MOTHER! Where is

everyone?” A frenzied searching 
of the planet, the solar system, 
the galaxy. Then a returning to 
the planet. Empty . Change. 
Buildings, roads, bridges weather- 
ing slowly. Such a race would 
have built of durable metal. Dur- 
able? Centuries, eons passed. 
Buildings crumbled to dust, dust 
blew away. Bridges eroded, fell, 
decomposed into basic elements. 
The shape of constellations 
changed. All trace of civilization 
passed except in the cavern of 
the heated pool. Constellations 
disappeared, new patterns formed 
in the night sky. The unutterably 
total void of time — FIVE HUN- 
DRED THOUSAND YEARS! 

And a nine-year-old child 
brooding over an empty world. 

“I don’t understand why your 
development stopped,” Stinson 
said. 

“Nor do I. But perhaps . well, 
I sense that I would continue, 
if you brought your people here. 
You have already taught me the 



value of life. There is a oneness, 
a bond that ties each living thing 
to every other living thing. It is 
a lesson my people never knew. 
Select any portion of this planet 
that suits you. Take the web- 
footed woman for your wife. 
Have children. I promise never 
to harm you in any way.” 

“The webfoots?” 

“You and they shall share the 
planet.” 

The Sand God disappeared. 
Sybtl said, “Is the Sand God 
angry again?” 

“No, he is not angry.” 

“I’m glad. You will leave 
now?” 

“No. This is my home.” 

She laughed softly. “You are 
a strange God.” 

“Listen,” he said, “I am not a 
God. Get that through your 
head.” 

She drew him into the cave. 
Her lips were cool and sweet. 
The cave was pleasantly warm.

H E HAD flared up more 
brightly than anyone in 
memory. And then he 
was gone. Yet there was ironic 
laughter where he had been; and 
his ghost still walked. That was 
the oddest thing: to encounter 
his ghost. 

It was like coming suddenly 
on Haley’s Comet drinking beer 
at the Plugged Nickel Bar, and 
having it deny that it was a 
celestial phenomenon at all, that 
it had ever been beyond the sun. 



For he could have been the man 
of the century, and now it was 
not even known if he was alive. 
And if he were alive, it would be 
very odd if he would be hanging 
around places like the Plugged 
Nickel Bar. 

This all begins with the award. 
But before that it begins with 
the man. 

Professor Aloys Foulcault-Oeg 
was acutely embarrassed and in 
a state of dread. 

“These I have to speak to, all

He appeared in glory and sank 
without a trace. Why? How? For 
the first time anywhere, here 
is the startling inside story. 



ALOYS

these great men. Is even glory 
worth the price when it must be 
paid in such coin?” 

Aloys did not have the ameni- 
ties, the polish, the tact. A child 
of penury, he had all his life 
eaten bread that was part saw- 
dust, and worn shoes that were 
part cardboard. He had an over- 
coat that had been his father’s, 
and before that his grandfather’s. 

This coat was no longer hand- 
some, its holes being stuffed and 
quilted with ancient rags. It was 
long past its years of greatness, 
and even when Aloys had in- 
herited it as a young man it was 
in the afternoon of its life. And 
yet it was worth more than any- 
thing else he owned in the world. 

Professor Aloys had become 
great in spite of — or because 
of? — his poverty. He had 
worked out his finest theory, a 
series of nineteen interlocked 
equations of cosmic shapeliness 
and simplicity. He had worked 
it out on a great piece of 
butchers’ paper soaked with 
lamb’s blood, and had so given 
it to the world. 

And once it was given, it was 
almost as though nothing else 
could be added on any subject 
whatsoever. Any further detail- 
ing would be only footnotes to 
it and all the sciences no more 
than commentaries. 

Naturally this made him fa- 
mous. But the beauty of it was 



that it made him famous, not to 
the commonalty of mankind 
(this would have been a burden 
to his sensitively tuned soul), 
but to a small and scattered class 
of extremely erudite men (about 
a score of them in the world). 
Their recognition brought him 
almost, if not quite, complete 
satisfaction. 

But he was not famous in his 
own street or his own quarter of 
town. And it was in this stark 
conglomerate of dark-souled al- 
leys and roofs that Professor 
Aloys had lived all his life till 
just thirty-seven days ago. 

When he received the an- 
nouncement, award, and invita- 
tion, he quickly calculated the 
time. It was not very long to 
allow travel halfway around the 
world. Being locked out of his 
rooms, as he often was, he was 
unencumbered by baggage or 
furniture, and he left for the 
ceremony at once. 

With the announcement, 
award, and invitation, there had 
also been a check; but as he was 
not overly familiar with the 
world of finance or with the 
English language in which it was 
written, he did not recognize it 
for what it was. Having used the 
back of it to write down a 
formula that had crept into his 
mind, he shoved the check, for- 
gotten, into one of the pockets of 
his greatcoat.

GALAXY 



F OR THREE days he rode a 
river boat to the port city, 
hidden and hungry. There he 
concealed himself on an ocean 
tramp. That he did not starve 
on this was due to the caprice 
of the low-lifers who discovered 
him, for they made him stay 
hidden in a terrible bunker and 
every day or two they passed in 
a bucket to him. 

Then, several ports and many 
days later, he left the ship like a 
crippled, dirty animal. And it 
was in That City and on That 
Day. For the award was to be 
that evening. 

“These I have to speak to, all 
these wonderful men who are 
higher than the grocers, higher 
than the butchers even. These 
men get more respect than a 
policeman, than a canal boat 
captain. They are wiser than a 
mayor and more honored than 
a merchant. They know arts 
more intricate than a clock- 
maker’s and are virtuous beyond 
the politicians. More perspica- 
cious than editors, more talented 
than actors, these are the great 
men of the world. And I am only 
Aloys, and now I am too ragged 
and dirty even to be Aloys any 
more. I no longer am a man with 
a name.” 

For he was very humble as he 
walked the great town where 
even the shop girls were dressed 
like princesses, and all the res- 



taurants were so fine that only 
the rich people would have dared 
to go in them at all. Had there 
been poor people (and there 
were none) there would have 
been no place for them to eat. 

“But it is to me they have 
given the prize. Not to Schel- 
lendore and not to Ottlebaum, 
not to Francks nor Timiryaseff, 
not even to Pitirim-Koss, the 
latchet of whose shoe I am not 
— but why do I say that? — he 
was not, after all, very bright — 
all of them are inadequate in 
some way — the only one who 
was ever able to get to the heart 
of these great things was Aloys 
Foulcault-Oeg, who happens to 
be myself. It is a strange thing 
that they should honor me, and 
yet I believe they could not have 
made a better choice.” 

So pride and fear warred in 
him, but it was always the pride 
that lost. For he had only a little 
bit of pride, undernourished and 
on quaking ground, and against 
it was a whole legion of fears, 
apprehensions, shames, dreads, 
embarrassments, and nightmar- 
ish bashfulnesses. 

He begged a little bit when he 
had found a poor part of town. 
But even here the people were 
of the rich poor, not the poor as 
he had known them. 

When he had money in his 
pocket, he had a meal. Then he 
went to Jiffy Quick While You 



ALOYS 



61 




Wait Cleaners Open Day and 
Night to have his clothes cleaned. 
He wrapped himself in dignity 
and a blanket while he waited. 
And as the daylight was coming 
to an end, they brought his 
clothes back to him. 

“We have done all we could 
do. If we had a week or a month, 
we might do a little more, but 
not much.” 

r I ''HEN HE went out into the 
town, cleaner than he had 
been in many years, and he 
walked to the hall of the Com- 
mendation and Award. Here he 
watched all th» great men arrive 
in private cars and taxis: Ergodic 
Eimer, August Angstrom, Vlad- 
imir Vor. He watched them and 
thought of what he would say to 
them, and then he realized that 
he had forgotten his English. 

“I remember dog, that is the 
first word I ever learned, but 
what will I say to them about a 
dog? I remember house and 
horse and apple and fish. Oh, 
now I remember the entire 
language. But what if I forget it 
again? Would it not be an odd 
speech if I could only say apple 
and fish and house and dog? I 
would be shamed.” 

He wished he were rich and 
could dress in white like the 
street sweepers, or in black 
leather like the newsboy on the 
corner. He saw Edward Edelstein 



62

and Christopher Cronin enter 
and he cowered on the street 
and knew that he would never 
be able to talk to those great 
men. 

A fine gentleman came out 
and walked directly to him. 

“You are the great Professor 
Foulcault-Oeg? I would have 
known you anywhere. True 
greatness shines from you. Our 
city is honored tonight. Come 
inside and we will go to a little 
room apart, for I see that you 
will have to compose yourself 
first. I am Graf-Doktor Hercule 
Bienville-Stravroguine.” 

Whyever he said he was the 
Graf-Doktor is a mystery, be- 
cause he was Willy McGilly and 
the other was just a name that 
he made up that minute. 

Within, they went to a small 
room behind the cloak room. But 
here, in spite of the smooth 
kindness of the gracious gentle- 
man, Aloys knew that he would 
never be able to compose him- 
self. He was an epouvantail, a 
pugalo, a clown, a ragamuffin. He 
looked at the nineteen-point out- 
line of the address he was to give. 
He shuddered and he gobbled 
like a turkey. He sniffled and he 
wiped his nose on his sleeve. He 
was terrified that the climax of 
his life’s work should find him 
too craven to accept it. And he 
discovered that he had forgotten 
his English again. 



“I remember bread and butter, 
but I don’t know which one goes 
on top. I know pencil and pen- 
knife and bed, but I have entirely 
forgotten the word for maternal 
uncle. I remember plow, but 
what in the world will I say to 
all these great men about a 
plow? I pray that this cup may 
pass from me.” 

Then he disintegrated in one 
abject mass of terror. Several 
minutes went by. 

OUT WHEN he emerged from 
-*-* the room he was a different 
man entirely. Erect, alive, in- 
tense, queerly handsome, and 
now in formal attire, he mounted 
with the sure grace of a panther 
to the speaker’s platform. Once 
only he glanced at the nineteen- 
point outline of his address. As 
there is no point in keeping it a 
secret, it was as follows: 1. 

Cepheid and Cerium — How 
Long Is a Yardstick? 2. Double 
Trouble — Is Ours a Binary Uni- 
verse? 3. Cerebrum and Cortex 

— the Mathematics of Melan- 
cholia. 4. Microphysics and Meg-

phosis. 9. Theogony and Tremor

ogy. 10. Planck’s Constant and 
Agnesi’s Variable. 11. Dien- 
cephalon and Di-Gamma — 
Unconscionable Thoughts about 
Consciousness. 12. Inverse 
Squares and the Quintesimal 
Radicals. 13. The Chain of 
Error in the Lineal B Transla- 
tion. 14. Skepticism — the 
Humor of the Humorless. 15. 
Ogive and Volute — Thoughts 
on Celestial Curviture. 16. Conic 
Sections — Small Pieces of In- 
finity. 17. Eschatology — Me- 
dium Thoughts about the End. 
18. Hypo-polarity and Cosmic 
Hysteresis. 19. The Invisible 
Quadratic, or This is All Simpler 
than You Think. 

You will immediately see the 
beauty of this skeleton, and yet 
to flesh it would not be the work 
of an ordinary man. 

He glanced over it with the 
sure smile of complete confi- 
dence. Then he spoke softly to 
the master of ceremonies in a 
whisper with a rumble that could 
be heard throughout the hall. 

“I am here. I will begin. There 
is no need for any further intro- 
duction.” 

For the next three and a half 
hours he held that intelligent 
audience completely spellbound, 
enchanted. They followed, or 
seemed to follow, his lightning 
flashes of metaphor illumining 
the craggy chasms of his vasty 
subjects. 



They thrilled to the magnetic 
power of his voice, ' urbane yet 
untamed, with its polyglot phras- 
ing and its bare touch of accent 
so strange as to be baffling; 
ancient, surely, and yet from a 
land beyond the Pale. And they 
quivered with interior pleasure 
at the glorious unfolding in 
climax after climax of these be- 
fore only half-glimpsed vistas. 

Here was a world of mystery 
revealed in all its wildness, and 
it obeyed and stood still, and he 
named its name. The nebula and 
the conch lay down together, and 
the ultra-galaxies equated them- 
selves with the zeta mesons. Like 
a rich householder, he brought 
from his store treasures old and 
new, and nothing like them had 
ever been seen or heard before. 

AT ONE POINT Professor 
Timiryaseff cried out in baf- 
flement and incomprehension, 
and Doctor Ergodic Eimer buried 
his face in his hands, for even 
these most erudite men could not 
glimpse all the shattering pro- 
fundity revealed by the fantastic 
speaker. 

And when it was over they 
were limp and delighted that so 
much had been made known to 
them. They had the crown with- 
out the cross, and the odd little 
genius had filled them with a 
rich glow. 

The rest was perfunctory, 



64

commendations and testimonials 
from all the great men. The 
trophy, heavy and rich but not 
flashy, worth the lifetime salary 
of a professor of mathematics, 
was accepted almost carelessly. 
And then the cup was passed 
quietly, which is to say the tall 
cool glasses went around as the 
men still lingered and talked 
with hushed pleasure. 

“Gin,” said the astonishing 
orator. “It is the drink of bums 
and impoverished scholars, and 
I am both. Yes, anything at all 
with it.” 

Then he spoke to Maecenas, 
who was at his side, the patron 
who was footing the bill for all 
this gracious extravagance. 



“The check I have never 
cashed, having been much in 
movement since I have received 
it. And as to me it is a large 
amount, though perhaps not to 
others, and as you yourself have 
signed it, I wonder if you could 
cash it for me now.” 

“At once,” said Maecenas, “at 
once. Ten minutes and we shall 
have the sum here. Ah, you have 
endorsed it with a formula! Who 
but Professor Aloys Foulcault- 
Oeg could be so droll? Look, he 
has endorsed it with a formula!” 
“Look, look! Let us copy! Why, 
this is marvelous! It takes us 
even beyond his great speech of 
tonight. The implications of it!” 
“Oh, the implications!” they 



said as they copied it off, and the 
implications rang in their heads 
like bells of the future. 

Now it had suddenly become 
very late, and the elated little 
man with the gold and gemmed 
trophy under one arm and the 
packet of bank notes in his 
pocket disappeared as by magic. 

TJROFESSOR Aloys Foulcault- 
Oeg was not seen again; or, if 
seen, he was not known, for 
hardly anyone would have 
known his face. In fact, when he 
had painfully released the bonds 
by which he had been tied in the 
little room behind the cloak 
room, and removed the shackles 
from his ankles, he did not pause 
at all, but slipped into his great- 
coat and ran out into the night. 
Not for many blocks did he even 
remove Jthe gag from his mouth, 
not realizing in his confusion 
what it was that obstructed his 
speech and breathing. But when 
he got it out, it was a pleasant 
relief. 

A kind gentleman took him in 
hand, the second to do so that 
night. He was bundled into a 
kind of taxi and driven to a 
mysterious quarter called Wreck- 
ville. And deep inside a secret 
building he was given a bath and 
a bowl of hot soup. And later he 
gathered with others at a festive 
board. 

Here Willy McGilly was king. 



As he worked his way into his 
cups with the gold trophy in 
front of him, he expounded and 
elucidated. 

“I was wonderful. I held them 
in the palm 'of my hand. Was I 
not wonderful, Oeg?” 

“I could not hear all, for I was 
on the floor of the little room. 
But from what I could hear, yes, 
you were wonderful.” 

“Only once in my life did I 
give a better speech. It was the 
same speech, but it was newer 
then. This was in Little Dogie, 
New Mexico, and I was selling a 
snake-oil derivative whose secret 
I still cannot reveal. But I was 
good tonight and some of them 
cried. And now what will you do, 
Oeg? Do you know what we 
are?” 

“M oshennekov.” 

“Why, so we are.” 
“Schwindlern.” 

“The very word.” 

“Low-life con men. And the 
world you live on is not the one 
you were born on. I will join you 
if I may.” 

“Oeg, you have a talent for 
going to the core of the apple.” 
For when a man (however 
unlikely a man) shows real 
talent, then the Wreckville bunch 
has to recruit him. They cannot 
have uncontrolled talent running 
loose in the commonalty of 
mankind.

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL 



Let the dead past bury its dead? Not while I am alive , 
it won't! BY JIM HARMON Illustrated by WALKER 



I T surely was all right for me 
to let myself do it now. I 
couldn’t have been more safe. 
In the window of the radio store a 
color television set was enjoying 
a quiz by itself and creased in 
my pocket was the newspaper 
account of the failure of a monu- 
mental human adventure in the 
blooming extinction of a huge 
rocket. The boys on the corner 



seemed hardly human, scowling 
anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. 
It was my own time. Anybody 
could see I was safe, and I could 
risk doing what I ached to do. 

I turned the corner. 

The breaks were against me 
from the start. It didn’t come as 
any surprise. I could never get 
away with it. I knew that all 
along. 



There was a Packard parked 
just beyond the fire plug. 

The metal and glass fronts of 
the buildings didn’t show back 
here, only seasoned brick glued 
with powdering chalk. The line 
of the block seemed to stretch 
back, ever further away from the 
glossy fronts into the crumbling 
stone. 

A man brushed past me, wear- 



ing an Ivy League suit and snap- 
brim hat, carrying a briefcase. 
And, reassuringly, he was in a 
hurry. 

I decided to chance it. I cer- 
tainly wanted to do it in the 
worst way. 

My footsteps carried me on 
down the block. 

A little car spurted on past me. 
One of those foreign jobs, I

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL

decided. Only it wasn’t. I fixed 
the silhouette in my mind’s eye 
and identified it. A Henry J. 

Still, I wasn’t worried. It was 
actually too early in the day. It 
wasn’t as if it were evening or 
anything like that. 

The little store was right where 
I left it, rotting quietly to itself. 
The Back Number Store, the 
faded circus poster proclaimed in 
red and gold, or now, pink and 
lemon. In the window, in cello- 
phane envelopes, were the first 
issue of Life, a recent issue of 
Modern Man with a modern 
woman fronting it, a Big Big 
Book of Buck Rogers and the 
Silver Cities of Venus, and a 
brand-new, sun-bleached copy of 
Doctor Zhivago. 

There was a little car at the 
curb. This time I recognized that 
it wasn’t an import, just a Cros- 
ley. 

I went in, the brass handle 
making me conscious of the sweat 
on my palm. 

r |''HE old man sat behind a for- 
tress of magazines and books, 
treacherously reading the funnies 
in a newspaper. His bald head 
swiveled on the hunched shoul- 
ders of his sweater which was 
azuring toward white. He grin- 
ned, toothless. 

“Came back for more of the 
stuff, did you?” 

He laid down the newspaper. 



(That subheadline couldn’t really 
be making so nasty a suggestion 
to a noted general, could it? ) 

“Yes,” I laughed, not very true. 

“I know what a craving can be. 

I shouldn’t smoke, but I do. I’ve 
tried to stop but I lie there think- 
ing about cigarettes half the night. 
Long ones, short ones, smoked 
ones, ones unlit. I feel like I 
could smoke one in each hand. 
It like that with you?” 

“Not that bad. To me it’s just — ” 

“Don’t tell me reading isn’t a 
craving with some of you fellows. 
I’ve seen guys come in here, 
hardly two threads stuck togeth- 
er on them, and grab up them 
horror magazines and read and 
read, until sweat starts rolling off 
the end of their nose. I’ve hardly 
got the heart to throw ’em out.” 

Horror magazines. 'Ones with 
lovely girls about to have their 
flesh shredded by toothy vam- 
pires. Yes, they were a part of 
it. Not a big part, but a part. 

“That’s not what I want to see. 
I want — ” 

The old man snickered. “I 
know what you want. Indeed I 
do. This way.” 

I followed his spidering hand 
and sure enough, there they were. 
Stacks upon stacks of air-war 
pulp magazines. 

“Fifteen cents for ones in good 
condition,” the old man pro- 
nounced the ritual, “a dime for 
ones with incomplete covers, 



70 



GALAXY 



three for a quarter, check ’em at 
the desk when you go.” 

I ran my hand down a stack. 
Wings, Daredevil Aces, G-8 and 
his Battle Aces, The Lone Eagle, 
all of them. 

The old man was watching me. 
He skittered back across the floor 
and snatched up a magazine. It 
was a copy of Sky Fighters with 
a girl in a painted-on flying suit 
hanging from the struts of a Tiger 
Moth. 

“This one, this one,” he said. 
“This must be a good one. I bet 
she gets shoved right into that 
propeller there. I bet she gets 
chopped to pieces. Pieces.” 

“I’ll take it.” 

Reluctantly he handed over 
the magazine, waited a moment, 
then left me. 

I stared at the stacks of flying 
story magazines and I felt the 
slow run of the drop of sweat 
down my nose. 

My sickness was terrible. It is 
as bad to be nostalgic for things 
you have never known as for an 
orphan who has never had a 
home to be homesick. 

T IVING in the past, that was 
always me. I never watched 
anything on TV made later than 
1935. I was in love with Garbo, 
Ginger Rogers, Dolores del Rio. 
My favorite stars were Richard 
Dix, Chester Morris and Richard 
Arlen. 



The music I listened to was 
Gershwin and Arlen and Chicago 
jazz. 

And my reading was the pulp 
literature harking back to the 
First World War. This was the 
biggest part of it all, I think. 

You identify with the hero of 
any story if it’s well enough writ- 
ten. But the identification I felt 
with the pilots in air-war stories 
was plainly ridiculous. 

I was there. 

I was in the saddle of the 
cockpit, feeling on my face the 
bite of the slipstream — no, that 
was a later term — the prop- 
wash? — no, that was still later 
— the backlash from the screw, 
that was it. I was lifting to meet 
the Fokker triplanes in the dawn 
sky. Then in a moment my 
Vickers was chattering in answer 
to Spandaus, firing through the 
screw outfitted with iron edges to 
deflect bullets that did not pass 
to the left and right. And back 
through the aerial maps in the 
cockpit pocket at my knee. 

Here he comes, the Spandaus 
firing right through the screw in 
perfect synchronization. Look at 
that chivalrous wave. You can 
almost see the dueling scar on 
his check from old Krautenberg. 
He can afford to be chivalrous in 
that Fokker. I’d like to trade this 
skiddoo for it. That may be just 
what I do too if I don’t watch it. 

You ain’t any Boelcke, mister,

but this is from the Fifth for 
Squadron 70. 

Missed! 

Hard on that rudder! God, look 
at the snake in that fabric. At 
least it was a lie about them using 
incendiaries. 

One of your own tricks for you, 
Heinie. Up on the stick, up under 
your tail, into the blind spot. 
Where am I? Where am I? Right 
here. 

Look at that tail go. Tony 
can’t be giving you as good stuff 
as he claims. 

So long. I’m waving, see. 

He’s pulling her up. No tail and 
he’s pulling her up. He’s a good 
man. Come on. A little more. A 
little more and you can deadstick 
her. Come on, buddy. You’re do- 
ing it. You’re pulling her up — 

But not enough. 

God, what a mess. 

I’m sick. 

That damned castor oil in the 
carburetor. I’ll be in the W. C. 
until oh-six-hundred . 

l\TO, the air wasn’t one of castor 

^ oil but the pleasant smell of 
aged paper and printer’s ink. 

I’d been daydreaming again. I 
shouldn’t forget things were get- 
ting different lately. It was be- 
coming dangerous. 

I gathered up an armload of 
air-war magazines at random. 

Leaning across the table, I 
noticed the curtain in back for 



the first time. It was a beaded 
curtain of many different colors. 
Theda Bara might have worn it 
for a skirt. Behind the curtain 
was a television set. It was a 
comforting anti-anachronism here. 

The six- or eight-inch picture 
was on a very flat tube, a more 
pronounced Predicta. The size 
and the flatness didn’t seem to 
go together. Then I saw that the 
top part of the set was a mirror 
reflecting an image from the roof 
of the cabinet where the actual 
picture tube lay flat. 

There was an old movie on the 
channel. An old, old movie. Lon 
Chaney, Sr., in a western as a 
badman. He was protecting a 
doll-faced blonde from the rest of 
the gang, standing them off from 
a grove of rocks. The flickering 
action caught my unblinking 
eyes. 

Tom Santschi is sneaking 
across the top of the rocks, a knife 
in his dirty half-breed hand. Ray- 
mond Hatton makes a try for his 
old boss, but Chaney stops his 
clock for him. Now William Far- 
num is riding up with the posse. 
Tom makes a try with the knife, 
the girl screams, and Chaney 
turns the blade back on him. It 
goes through his neck, all the way 
through. 

The blonde is running toward 
Farnum as he polishes off the 
rest of the gang and dismounts, 
her blouse shredded, revealing 



72 



GALAXY 



one breast — is that the dawn 
of Bessie Love? Chaney stands 
up in the rocks. Farnum aims 
his six-shooter. No, no, say the 
girl’s lips. “No!” “No!” says the 
subtitle. Farnum fires. Swimming 
in blood, Chaney smiles sadly 
and falls. 

I had seen movies like that be- 
fore. 

When I was a kid, I had seen 
Flicker Flashbacks between chap- 
ters of Flash Gordon and Johnny 
Mack Brown westerns. I looked 
at old movies and heard the oily 
voice making fun of them. But 
hadn’t I also seen these pictures 
with the sound of piano playing 
and low conversation? 

I had seen these pictures be- 
fore the war. 

The war had made a lot of 
difference in my life. 

Comic books were cut down to 
half their size, from 64 to 32 
pages, and prices had gone up to 
where you had to pay $17 for a 
pair of shoes, so high that people 
said Wilson should do something 
about it. 

Tom Mix had gone off the air 
and he and his Cowboy Com- 
mandos beat the Japs in comic 
books. Only, hadn’t he sold 
Liberty Bonds with Helen Mor- 
gan? 

And at school I had bought 
Defense — War — Savings — 
Security — Liberty — Freedom 
— I had bought stamps at school. 



I never did get enough to trade 
in for a bond, but Mama had 
taken my book and traded parts 
of it in for coffee. She could never 
get enough coffee . 

“Nobody would look at my 
magazines,” the old man chuck- 
led, “if I put it out front. My boy 
got me that. He runs a radio and 
Victrola store. A good boy. His 
name’s in the fishbowl.” 

I pressed some money on him 
and walked myself out of the 
store. Shutting the door, I saw 
that the copy of Doctor Zhivago 
had been replaced by Gone With 
the Wind. 

'T'HE street was full of wooden- 
paneled station wagons, blunt 
little roadsters with canvas tops, 
swept-back, tailless sedans. Only 
one dark, tailed, over-thyroided 
car moved through the traffic. It 
had a light on the roof. 

I dodged in front of a horse- 
drawn garbage wagon and behind 
an electric postal truck and ran 
for that light, leaving a trail of 
gaudy air battles checkering the 
street behind me. 

I grabbed the handle on the 
door, opened it and threw my- 
self into the back seat. 

“Madison Avenue,” I said from 
my diaphragm, without any 
breath behind it. 

Something was wrong. Two 
men were in the front seat. The 
driver showed me his hard, ex- 



THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL 



73 



pressionless face. “What do you 
think you are doing?” 

“This isn’t a taxicab?” I asked 
blankly. 

“Park Police.” 

I sat there while we drove on 
for a few minutes. 

“D. & D.,” the second man 
said to the driver. 

“Right into our laps.” 

The second officer leaned for- 
ward and clicked something. “I’ll 
get the City boys.” 

“No, kill it, Carl. Think of all 
that damned paper work.” 

Carl shrugged. “What will we 
do with him?” 

I was beginning to attach my- 
self to my surroundings. The 
street was full of traffic. My kind 
of traffic. Cars that were too big 
or too small. 

“Look, officers, I’m not drunk 
or disorderly. I thought this was a 
cab. I just wanted to get away 
from back then — I mean back 
there.” 

The two policemen exchanged 
glances. 

“What were you running 
from?” the driver asked. 

How could I tell him that? 

Before I even got a chance to 
try, he said: “What did you do?” 

“I didn’t do anything!” 

The car was turning, turning 
into shadows, stopping. We were 
in an alley. Soggy newspapers, 
dead fish, prowling cats, a broken 
die, half a dice, looking big in 



the frame of my thick, probably 
bullet-proof window. 

The men opened their doors 
and then mine. 

“Out.” 

¥ climbed out and stood by the 
A car, blinking. 

“You were causing some kind 
of trouble in that neighborhood 
back there,” the driver an- 
nounced. 

“Really, officers — ” 

“What’s your name?” 

“Hilliard Turner. There — ” 
“We don’t want you going back 
there again, Turner, causing 
trouble. Understand?” 

“Officer, I only bought some 
books — I mean magazines.” 
“These?” the second man, Carl, 
asked. He had retrieved them 
from the back seat. “Look here, 
Sarge. They look pretty dirty.” 
Sarge took up the Sky Fight- 
ers with the girl in the elastic 
flying suit. “Filth,” he said. 

“You know about the laws 
governing pornography, Turner.” 
“Those aren’t pornography and 
they are my property!” 

I reached for them and Carl 
pulled them back, grinning. “You 
don’t want to read these. They 
aren’t good for you. We’re con- 
fiscating them.” 

“Look here, I’m a citizen! You 
can’t — ” 

Carl shoved me back a little. 
“Can’t we?”

Sarge stepped in front of me, 
his face in deadly earnest. “How 
about it, Turner? You a narcotics 
user?” 

He grabbed my wrist and 
started rolling up my sleeve to 
look for needle marks. I twisted 
away from him. 

“Resisting an officer,” Sarge 
said almostly sadly. 

At that, Carl loped up beside 
him. 

The two of them started to 
beat me. 

They hit clean, in the belly 
and guts, but not in the groin. 
They gave me clean white flashes 
of pain, instead of angry, red- 
streaked ones. I didn’t fight back, 
not against the two of them. I 
knew that much. I didn’t even try 
to block their blows. I stood with 
my arms at my sides, leaning 
back against the car, and hearing 
myself grunt at each blow. 

They stood away from me and 
let me fold helplessly to the 
greasy brick. 

“Stay away from that neigh- 
borhood and stay out of trouble,” 
Sarge’s voice said above me. 

I looked up a little bit and 
saw an ugly, battered hand 
thumbing across a stack of half 
a dozen magazines like a giant 
deck of cards. 

“Why don’t you take up detec- 
tive stories?” he asked me. 

I never heard the squad car 
drive away. 



TTOME. I lighted the living 

A room from the door, looked 
around for intruders for the first 
time I could remember, and went 
inside. 

I threw myself on the couch 
and rubbed my stomach. I wasn’t 
hurt badly. My middle was going 
to be sorer in the morning than 
it was now. 

Lighting up a cigarette, I 
watched the shapes of smoke and 
tried to think. 

I looked at it objectively, for- 
ward and back. 

The solution was obvious. 

First of all, I positively could 
not have been an aviator in 
World War One. I was in my 
mid-twenties; anybody could tell 
that by looking at me. The time 
was the late ‘Fifties; anybody 
could tell that from the blank- 
faced Motorola in the corner, the 
new Edsels on the street. Memo- 
ries of air combat in Spads and 
Nieuports stirred in me by old 
magazines, Quentin Reynolds, 
and re-runs of Dawn Patrol on 
television were mere hallucina- 
tions. 

Neither could I remember 
drinking bootleg hooch in speak- 
easies, hearing Floyd Gibbons an- 
nounce the Dempsey-Tunney 
fight, or paying $3.80 to get into 
the first run of Gone with the 
Wind. 

Only ... I probably had seen 
GWTW. Hadn’t I gone with my 



THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL 



75 



mother to a matinee? Didn’t she 
pay 900 for me? So how could 
I remember taking a girl, bru- 
nette, red sweater, Cathy, and 
paying $3.80 each? I couldn’t. 
Different runs. That was it. The 
thing had been around half a 
dozen times. But would it have 
been $3.80 no more than ten 
years ago? 

I struck up a new cigarette. 

The thing I must remember, I 
told myself, was that my recol- 
lections were false and unreliable. 
It would do me no good to keep 
following these false memories in 
a closed curve. 

I touched my navel area and 
flinched. The beating, I was con- 
fident, had been real. But it had 
been a nightmare. Those cops 
couldn’t have been true. They 
were a small boy’s bad dream 
about symbolized authority. They 
were keeping me from re-enter- 
ing the past where I belonged, 
punishing me to make me stay in 
my trap of the present. 

Oh, God. 

I rolled over on my face and 
pushed it into the upholstery. 

That was the worst part of it. 
False memories, feelings of per- 
secution, that was one thing. Be- 
lieving that you are actively 
caught up in a mixture of the past 
with the present, a Daliesque 
viscosity of reality, was some- 
thing else. 

I needed help. 



Or if there was no help for 
me, it was my duty to have my- 
self placed where I couldn’t harm 
other consumers. 

If there was one thing that 
working for an advertising agency 
had taught me, it was social re- 
sponsibility. 

I took up the phone book and 
located several psychiatrists. I 
selected one at random, for no 
particular reason. 

Dr. Ernest G. Rickenbacker. 

I memorized the address and 
heaved myself to my feet. 

HPHE doctor’s office was as green 
as the inside of a mentholated 
cigarette commercial. 

The cool, lovely receptionist 
told me to wait and I did, tast- 
ing mint inside my mouth. 

After several long, peaceful 
minutes the inner door opened. 

“Mr. Turner, I can’t seem to 
find any record of an appoint- 
ment for you in Dr. Ricken- 
backer’s files,” the man said. 

I got to my feet. “Then I’ll 
come back.” 

He took my arm. “No, no, I 
can fit you in.” 

“I didn’t have an appointment. 
I just came.” 

“I understand.” 

“Maybe I had better go.” 

“I won’t hear of it.” 

I could have pulled loose from 
him, but somehow I felt that if 
I did try to pull away, the grip 



76 



GALAXY 



would tighten and I would never 
get away. 

I looked up into that long, 
hard, blank face that seemed so 
recently familiar. 

“I’m Dr. Sergeant,” he said. 
“I’m taking care of Dr. Ricken- 
backer’s practice for him while 
he is on vacation.” 

I nodded. What I was think- 
ing could only be another symp- 
tom of my illness. 

He led me inside and closed 
the door. 

The door made a strange sound 
in closing. It didn’t go snick- 
bonk; it made a noise like click- 
clack-clunk. 

“Now,” he said, “would you like 
to lie down on the couch and 
tell me about it? Some people 
have preconceived ideas that I 
don’t want to fight with at the 
beginning. Or, if you prefer, you 
can sit there in front of my desk 
and tell me all about it. Remem- 
ber, I’m a psychiatrist, a doctor, 
not just a psychoanalyst.” 

I took possession of the chair 
and Sergeant faced me across his 
desk. 

“I feel,” I said, “that I am 
caught up in some kind of time 
travel.” 

“I see. Have you read much 
science fiction, Mr. Turner?” 

“Some. I read a lot. All kinds 
of books. Tolstoi, Twain, Heming- 
way, Luke Short, John D. Mac- 
Donald, Huxley.” 



“You should read them instead 
of live them. Catharsis. Subli- 
mate, Mr. Turner. For instance, 
to a certain type of person, I often 
recommend the mysteries of 
Mickey Spillane.” 

I seemed to be losing control 
of the conversation. “But this 
time travel ...” 

“Mr. Turner, do you really be- 
lieve in ‘time travel’?” 

“No.” 

“Then how can there, be any 
such thing? It can’t be real.” 
“I know that! I want to be 
cured of imagining it.” 

“The first step is to utterly 
renounce the idea. Stop thinking 
about the past. Think of the 
future.” 

“How did you know I keep 
slipping back into the past?” I 
asked. 

SERGEANT’S hands were more 
^expressive than his face. “You 
mentioned time travel . .” 

“But not to the past or to the 
future,” I said. 

“But you did, Mr. Turner. You 
told me all about thinking you 
could go into the past by visiting 
a book store where they sold old 
magazines. You told me how the 
intrusion of the past got worse 
with every visit.” 

I blinked. “I did? I did?” 

“Of course.” 

I stood up. “I did not!” 
“Please try to keep from get-

ting violent, Mr. Turner. People 
like you actually have more con- 
trol over themselves than you 
realize. If you will yourself to be 
calm . ." 

“I know I didn’t tell you a 
thing about the Back Number 
Store. I’m starting to think I’m 
not crazy at all. You — you’re 
trying to do something to me. 
You’re all in it together.” 

Sergeant shook his head sadly. 

I realized how it all sounded. 

“Good — GOD!” I moaned. 

I put my hands to my face 
and I felt the vein over my left 
eye swelling, pulsing. 

Through the bars of my fingers 
I saw Sergeant motion me down 
with one eloquent hand. I took 
my hands away — I didn’t like 
looking through bars — and sat 
down. 

“Now,” Sergeant said, steepling 
his fingers, “I know of a com- 
pletely nice place in the country. 
Of course, if you respond prop- 
erly ...” 

Those hands of his. 

There was something about 
them that wasn’t so. They might 
have been the hands of a corpse, 
or a doll ... 

I lurched across the desk and 
grabbed his wrist. 

“Please, Mr. Turner! violence 
will—” 

My fingers clawed at the backs 
of his hands and my nails dragged 
off ugly strips of some theatrical 



stuff — collodion, I think — that 
had covered the scrapes and 
bruises he had taken hammer- 
ing away at me and my belt 
buckle. 

Sergeant. 

Sarge. 

I let go of him and stood away. 

For the first time, Sergeant 
smiled. 

I backed to the door and turned 
the knob behind my back. It 
wouldn’t open. 

I turned around and rattled it, 
pulled on it, braced my foot 
against the wall and tugged. 

“Locked,” Sergeant supplied. 

He was coming toward me, I 
could tell. I wheeled and faced 
him. He had a hypodermic needle. 
It was the smallest one I had 
ever seen and it had an irides- 
cence or luminosity about it, a 
gleaming silver dart. 

I closed with him. 

B Y THE way he moved, I 
knew he was used to physical 
combat, but you can’t win them 
all, and I had been in a lot of 
scraps when I had been younger. 
(Hadn’t I?) 

I stepped in while he was try- 
ing to decide whether to use the 
hypo on me or drop it to have his 
hands free. I stiff-handed him in 
the solar plexus and crossed my 
fist into the hollow of the apex 
arch of his jawbone. He dropped. 
I gave him a kick at the base 



of his spine. He grunted and lay 
still. 

There was a rapping on the 
door. “Doctor? Doctor?” 

I searched through his pockets. 
He didn’t have any keys. He 
didn’t have any money or identi- 
fication or a gun. He had a 
handkerchief and a ballpoint pen. 

The receptionist had moved 
away from the door and was 
talking to somebody, in person 
or on the phone or intercom. 

There wasn’t any back door. 

I went to the window. The city 
stretched out in an impressive 
panorama. On the street below, 
traffic crawled. There was a ledge. 
Quite a wide, old-fashioned orna- 
mental ledge. 

The ledge ran beneath the 
windows of all the offices on this 
floor. The fourteenth, I remem- 
bered. 

I had seen it done in movies 
all my life. Harold Lloyd, Doug- 
las Fairbanks, Buster Keaton 
were always doing it for some 
reason or other. I had a good 
reason. 

I unlatched the window and 
climbed out into the dry, crisp 
breeze. 

The movies didn’t know much 
about convection. The updraft 
nearly lifted me off the ledge, but 
the cornice was so wide I could 
keep out of the wind if I kept 
myself flat against the side of the 
building. 

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL 



The next window was about 
twenty feet away. I had covered 
half that distance, moving my 
feet with a sideways crab motion, 
when Carl, indisputably the sec- 
ond policeman, put his head out 
of the window where I was 
heading and pointed a .38 re- 
volver at me, saying in a lefs- 
have-no-foolishness tone: “Get in 
here.” 

I went the other way. 

The cool, lovely receptionist 
was in Sergeant’s window with 
the tiny silver needle in readiness. 

I kept shuffling toward the 
girl. I had decided I would rather 
wrestle with her over the needle 
than fight Carl over the rod. 
Idiotically, I smiled at that idea. 

I slipped. 

I was falling down the fourteen 
stories without even a moment of 
windmilling for balance. I was 
just gone. 

Lines were converging, and I 
was converging on the lines. 

You aren’t going to be able to 
Immelmann out of this dive, 
Turner. Good-by, Turner. 

Death. 

A sleep, a reawakening, a lie. 
It’s nothing like that. It’s nothing. 

The end of everything you ever 
were or ever could be. 

I hit. 

My kneecap hurt like hell. I 
had scraped it badly. 

Reality was all over me in 
patches. I showed through as a 



78 



GALAXY 



79 



line drawing, crudely done, a 
cartoon. 

Some kind of projection. High- 
test Cinerama, that was all reality 
meant. 

I was kneeling on a hard sur- 
face no more than six feet from 
the window from which I had 
fallen. It was still fourteen flights 
up, more or less, but Down was 
broken and splattered over me. 

I stood up, moving forward a 
step. 

It brought me halfway through 
the screen, halfway through the 
wall at the base of the building. 
The other side of the screen. The 
solid side, I found, stepping 
through, bracing a hand on the 
image. 

Looking up fourteen floors, I 
saw an unbroken line of peace- 
fully closed panes. 

T REMEMBERED riding up in 
the elevator, the moments in- 
side, the faint feeling of vertigo. 
Of course, who was to say the 
elevator really moved? Maybe 
they had only switched scenery 
on me while I was caught inside, 
listening to the phony hum, see- 
ing the flashing lights. Either cut 
down or increase the oxygen 
supply inside the cubicle sud- 
denly and that would contribute 
a sensation of change, of move- 
ment. They had it all worked out. 

My fingers rubbed my head 
briskly, both hands working, try- 



ing to get some circulation in my 
brain. 

I guessed I had to run. There 
didn’t seem much else to do. 

I ran. 

Get help? 

Not this old lady and her 
daughter. Not this Neanderthal 
sailor on his way to a bar and 
a blonde. Not the bookkeeper. 
Maybe the car salesman, ex- 
Army, Lions Club member, beefy, 
respectable, well-intentioned, not 
a complete fool. The guy on the 
corner reading a newspaper by 
the bus stop. 

“I need help,” I panted to him. 

“Somebody’s trying to kidnap 
>1 

me. 

“Really makes you sick to hear 
about something like that, doesn’t 
it?” he said. “I’m in favor of the 
Lindbergh Law myself.” 

“I’m not sure whether — ” 

“This heat is murder, isn’t it? 
Especially here in these concrete 
canyons. Sometimes I wish I was 
back in Springfield. Cool, shaded 
streets . .” 

“Listen to me! These people, 
they’re conspiring against me, try- 
ing to drive me insane! Two men, 
a girl — ” 

“For my money, Marilyn Mon- 
roe is the doll of the world. I just 
don’t understand these guys who 
say she hasn’t got class. She gets 
class by satirizing girls without 
any . .” 

He was like anybody you 



80 



GALAXY 




might talk to on the street. I 
knew what he would say if I 
cued him with “baseball” or 
“Russia” instead of the key words 
I had used. 

I should have known better, 
but I wanted to touch him in 
some way, make him know I was 
alive. I grabbed him and shook 
him by the shoulders, and there 
was a whoosh and as I might have 
expected he collapsed like the 
insubstantiality he was. 

There was a stick figure of a 
man left before me, an economi- 
cal skeleton supporting the shell 
of a human being and two-thirds 
of a two-trouser suit. 

Hide. 

I went into the first shop I 
came to — Milady’s Personals. 

Appropriately, it was a false 
front. 

A neutral-colored gray surface, 
too smooth for concrete, stretched 
away into some shadows. The 
area was littered with trash. 

Cartons, bottles, what looked 
like the skin of a dehydrated hu- 
man being — obviously, on sec- 
ond thought, only the discarded 
skin of one of the things like the 
one I had deflated. 

And a moldering pile of letters 
and papers. 

Something caught my eye and 
I kicked through them. Yes, the 
letter I had written to my brother 
in Sioux Falls, unopened. And 
which he had answered. 



My work. 

The work I had done at the 
agency, important, creative work. 
There was my layout, the rough 
of the people with short, slim 
glasses, the parents, children, 
grandparents, the caption: Vodka 
is a Part of the American Tradi- 
tion. 

All of it lying here to rot. 

Something made me look away 
from that terrible trash. 

Sergeant stood in the entrance 
of Milady’s, something bright in 
his hand. 

Something happened. 

I had been wrong. 

The shining instrument had 
not been a hypodermic needle.

focus. 

“You aren’t, not without help,” 
I told him in disgust. 

“Spunky, aren’t you? I meant 
mental toughness. That’s the one 
thing we can never judge. I 
think you could have taken the 
shock right from the start. Of 
course, you would still have 
needed the conditioning to inte- 
grate properly.” 

“Conditioning? Conditioning?” 
It came out of me, vortexing up, 
outside of my piloting. “What 
have you done to my mind?” 

“We’ve been trying to get it to 
grow back up,” Sergeant said rea- 
sonably. “Think of this. Fountain

r of Youth. Immortality. Rejuvena- 
tion. This is it. Never mind how 
it works. Most minds can’t stand 
being young and knowing they 
will have to go through the same 
damned thing all over again. We 
use synapse-shift to switch your 
upper conscious memories to your 
id and super-ego, leaving room 
for new memories. You remember 
only those things out of the past

tity.” 

Jf ' “Identity,” I repeated. “I have 
no identity. My identity is a 
dream. I have two identities — 
one of them years beyond the 
other.” 

Sergeant tilted hi? head and 
his eyes at me and slapped me 
across the face. “Don’t go back on 



me now. We gave you the best we 
could. The Rejuvenation Serv- 
ice couldn’t help it if you were 
too old for a beta. You shouldn’t 
have waited until you were so 
old, so very old. We used the very 
oldest sets and mock-ups we had 
for betas, but you, you had to 
keep wandering onto alpha ter- 
ritory, while they were striking 
sets, even. Beta or not, we gave 
you good service. Don’t slip now.” 
I heard the voice and I heard 
another voice, and it said “What 
could you expect of a beta?” and 
they were only some of the voices 
I was hearing, and I wondered 
what you could expect from a 
beta, and I didn’t know, or think 
that I would ever know.

FORECAST 

October— big month! At least four novelettes — maybe half a dozen 
short stories — all in all, an issue crammed with good reading. 

For instance? Well, what about a fine new Fritz Leiber? The name of 
his October contribution is The Beat Cluster, a story about . (pause while 
editor fights against temptation — and loses) ... a bunch of Beats who are 
Really Out of This World. 

Or there's a great Cordwainer Smith novelette, perhaps his best ever: 
A Planet Named Shayol. Shayol turns out to be, indeed, another word for 
Hell. 

But perhaps the really big story for October is Arcturus Times Three. 
It's the first of a series and, as you long-time addicts know. Galaxy has 
seldom been tempted into the dangers of publishing series stories. This one, 
though, has a premise too good to miss! jack Sharkey is the writer; you'll 
be seeing a lot of him here. 

Yes, indeed. Big month — big magazine. (More pages than any other 
in the field!) Don't miss October!

Three creatures sat on the sands of Mars, 

and the first, to the ancient twiddling bars 

that the second played on a twalreg flute 

sang a canal lay most convolute, 

while the third, with his horn in the sand, sat mute, 

considering the stars. 

At last the second stilled his fife, 
and the third twonged out (his voice was rife 
with a hint of fear) “Do you know that there, 
where the third planet spins in its veil of air, 

I’m convinced there’s a spot, a jot, a hair, 
a widge, perhaps, of life.” 

The first began an amusement dance, 
while the second, fourth eyes crossed, askance, 
skibbed with extreme severity, 

“You ought to watch your tongues,” quoth he. 

“One should not affront the Deity 
by mentioning such chance. 

“For years our scientists have spent 
their time in the establishment 
of reasons why the life we know 
could not exist above, below, 
or anyplace but here! They show 
that fact self evident.” 

Just then their eyes were caught, aghast, 
for where the air-veiled planet passed 
a ball of fire had blossomed wide, 
and holocausts together vied 
to rip the ravened glpbe aside 
with nothing left at last. 

Murmured the first, “You will allow, 

by every old and sacred vow, 

this proves my point and proves it well. 

Those pyrotechnics must compel 
you to recant!” The third said, “Hell, 
it doesn’t matter now.” 

And they sat back down on the sands of Mars 
to hear the ancient, twiddling bars 
of a Martian dirge or the twalreg flute, 
in troches old and dissolute, 

while the third, with his horn in the sand, sat mute, 
considering the stars.

“I was,” she said bitterly. They 
had stopped in front of Bern- 
stein’s small office and she drew 
her arm away. “But then you 
called me. About this drug of 
yours — ” 

“We had to call you. Senopo- 
line can’t be administered with- 
out permission of the patient, 
and since your husband has been 
in coma for the last four days — ” 
He opened the door and nod- 
ded her inside. She hesitated, 
then walked in. He took his place 
behind the cluttered desk, his 
grave face distracted, and waited 
until she sat down in the facing 
chair. He picked up his telephone 
receiver, replaced it, shuffled 
papers, and then locked his 
hands on the desk blotter. 

“Senopoline is a curious drug,” 
he said. “I’ve had little experience 
with it myself. You may have 
heard about the controversy sur- 
rounding it.” 

“No,” she whispered. “I don’t 
know about it. I haven’t cared 
about anything since Andy’s ill- 
ness.” / 

“At any rate, you’re the only 
person in the world that can 
decide whether your husband re- 
ceives it. It’s strange stuff, as I 
said, but in the light of your 
husband’s present condition, I 
can tell you this — it can do him 
absolutely no harm.” 

“But it will do him good?” 
“There,” Bernstein sighed, “is 



the crux of the controversy, Mrs.

DOW, row, row your boat, he 
'®-*-sang in his mind, feeling the 
lapping tongues of the cool lake 
water against his fingers, drifting, 
drifting, under obeisant willows. 
Paula’s hands were resting gently 
on his eyes and he lifted them 
away. Then he kissed the soft 
palms and pressed them on his 
cheek. When he opened his eyes, 
he was surprised to find that the 
boat was a bed, the water only 
pelting rain against the window, 
and the willow trees long 
shadows on the walls. Only 
Paula’s hands were real, solid 
and real and comforting against 
his face. 

He grinned at her. “Funniest 
damn thing,” he said. “For a 
minute there, I though? we were 
back at Finger Lake. Remember 
that night we sprang a leak? I’ll 
never forget the way you looked 
when you saw the hem of your

“Andy,” she said quietly. “Andy, 
do you know what’s happened?” 

He scratched his head. “Seems 
to me Doc Bernstein was in here 
a while ago. Or was he? Didn’t 
they jab me again or something?” 

“It was a drug, Andy. Don’t 
you remember? They have this

“Oh, sure, I remember.” 

He sat up in bed, casually, as 
if sitting up in bed were an 
everyday occurrence. He took a 
cigarette from the table beside 
him and lit one. He smoked re- 
flectively for a moment, and 
then recalled that he hadn’t been 
anything but horizontal for al- 
most eight months. Swiftly, he 
put his hand on his rib cage and 
touched the firm flesh. 

“The girdle,” he said wonder- 
ingly. “Where the hell’s the 
girdle?” 

“They took it off,” Paula said 
tearfully. “Oh, Andy, they took 
it off. You don’t need it any 
more. You’re healed, completely 
healed. It’s a miracle!” 

“A miracle ...” 

She threw her arms about 
him; they hadn’t held each other 
since the accident a year ago, the 
accident that had snapped his 
spine in several places. He had 
been twenty-two* when it hap- 
pened. 

T HEY released him from the 
hospital three days later; 
after half a year in the hushed 
white world, the city outside 
seemed wildly clamorous and riot- 
ously colorful, like a town at the 
height of carnival. He had never 
felt so well in his life; he was 
eager to put the strong springs of 
his muscles back into play. 
Bernstein had made the usual 



speech about rest, but a week 
after his discharge Andy and 
Paula were at the courts in tennis 
clothes. 

Andy had always been a 
dedicated player, but his stiff- 
armed forehand and poor net 
game had always prevented him 
from being anything more than 
a passable amateur. Now he was 
a demon on the court, no ball 
escaping his swift-moving racket. 
He astounded himself with the 
accuracy of his crashing serves, 
his incredible play at the net. 

Paula, a junior champion dur- 
ing her college years, couldn’t 
begin to cope with him; laugh- 
ingly, she gave up and watched 
him battle the club professional. 
He took the first set 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, 
and Andy knew that something 
more magical than medicinal had 
happened to him. 

They talked it over, excited as 
schoolchildren, all the way home. 
Andy, who had taken a job in a 
stock-brokerage house after col- 
lege, and who had been bored 
silly with the whole business 
until the accident, began wonder- 
ing if he could make a career on 
the tennis court. 

To make sure his superb 
playing wasn’t a fluke, they re- 
turned to the club the next day. 
This time, Andy found a former 
Davis Cup challenger to com- 
pete with. At the end of the 
afternoon, his heart pounding to 

GALAXY 



the beat of victory, he knew it 
was true. 

That night, with Paula in his 
lap, he stroked her long auburn 
hair and said: “No, Paula, it’s all 
wrong. I’d like to keep it up, 
maybe enter the Nationals, but 
that’s no life for me. It’s only a 
game, after all.” 

“Only a game?” she said mock- 
ingly. “That’s a fine thing for the 
next top-seeded man to say.” 
“No, I’m serious. Oh, I don’t 
mean I intend to stay in Wall 
Street; that’s not my ambition 
either. As a matter of fact, I was 
thinking of painting again.” 
“Painting? You haven’t painted 
since your freshman year. You 
think you can make a living at 
it?” 

“I was always pretty good, you 
know that. I’d like to try doing 
some commercial illustration; 
that’s for the bread and potatoes. 
Then, when we don’t have to 
worry about creditors, I’d like to 
do some things on my own.” 
“Don’t pull a Gauguin on me, 
friend.” She kissed his cheek 
“lightly. “Don’t desert your wife 
and family for some Tahitian 
idyll ...” 

“Wh,at family?” 

She pulled away from him and 
got up to stir the ashes in the 
fireplace. When she returned, her 
face was glowing with the heat 
of the fire and warmth of her 
news. 

THE STUFF 



Andrew Hills, Junior, was born 
in September. Two years later, 
little Denise took over the hand- 
me-down cradle. By that time, 
Andy Hills was signing his name 
to the magazine covers of Amer- 
ica’s top-circulation weeklies, and 
they were happy to feature it. 
His added fame as America’s top- 
ranked amateur tennis champion 
made the signature all the more 
desirable. 

YfTHEN Andrew Junior was 
three, Andrew Senior made 
his most important advance in 
the field of art — not on the 
cover of the Saturday Evening 
Post, but in the halls of the 
Modern Museum of Art. His 
first exhibit evoked such a tor- 
rent of superlatives that the New 
York Times found the reaction 
newsworthy enough for a box on 
the front page. There was a cel- 
ebration in the Hills household 
that night, attended by their 
closest friends: copies of slick 
magazines were ceremoniously 
burned and the ashes placed in a 
dime-store urn that Paula had 
bought for the occasion. 

A month later, they were sign- 
ing the documents that entitled 
them to a sprawling hilltop house 
in Westchester, with a north-light 
glassed-in studio the size of their 
former apartment. 

He was thirty-five when the 
urge struck him to rectify a 



88 



89 



sordid political situation in their 
town. His fame as an artist and 
tennis-champion (even at thirty- 
five, he was top-seeded in the Na- 
tionals) gave him an easy entree 
into the political melee. At first, 
the idea of vote-seeking appalled 
him; but he couldn’t retreat 
once the movement started. He 
won easily and was elected to 
the town council. The office was 
a minor one, but he was enough 
of a celebrity to attract country- 
wide attention. During the follow- 
ing year, he began to receive 
visits from important men in 
party circles; in the next state 
election, his name was on the 
ballot. By the time he was forty, 
Andrew Hills was a U.S. Senator. 

That spring, he and Paula 
spent a month in Acapulco, in 
an enchanting home they had 
erected in the cool shadows of 
the steep mountains that faced 
the bay. It was there that Andy 
talked about his future. 

“I know what the party’s 
planning,” he told his wife, “but 
I know they’re wrong. I’m not 
Presidential timber, Paula.” 

But the decision wasn’t neces- 
sary; by summer, the Asiatic Al- 
liance had tired of the incessant 
talks with the peacemakers and 
had launched their attack on the 
Alaskan frontier. Andy was com- 
missioned at once as a major. 

His gallantry in action, his 
brilliant recapture of Shaktolik, 



White Mountain, and eventual 
triumphant march into Nome 
guaranteed him a place in the 
High Command of the Allied 
Armies. 

By the end of the first year of 
fighting, there were two silver 
stars on his shoulder and he was 
given the most critical assign- 
ment of all — to represent the 
Allies in the negotiations that 
were taking place in Fox Island 
in the Aleutians. Later, he denied 
that he was solely responsible for 
the successful culmination of the 
peace talks, but the American 
populace thought him hero 
enough to sweep him into the 
White House the following year 
in a landslide victory unparalleled 
in political history. 

He was fifty by the time he left 
Washington, but his greatest tri- 
umphs were yet to come. In his 
second term, his interest in the 
World Organization had given 
him a major role in world politics. 
As First Secretary of the World 
Council, his ability to effect a 
working compromise between the 
ideological factions was directly 
responsible for the establishment 
of the World Government. 

When he was sixty-four, An- 
drew Hills was elected World 
President, and he held the office 
until his voluntary retirement at 
seventy-five. Still active and 
vigorous, still capable of a com- 
manding tennis game, of a paint-

ing that set art circles gasping, he 
and Paula moved permanently 
into the house in Acapulco. 

He was ninety-six when the 
fatigue of living overtook him. 
Andrew Junior, with his four 
grandchildren, and Denise, with 
her charming twins, paid him one 
last visit before he took to his 
bed. 

* * * 

64¥>UT WHAT is the stuff?” 
-*~*Paula said. “Does it cure or 
what? I have a right to know!” 
Dr. Bernstein frowned. “It’s 
rather hard to describe. It has 
no curative powers. It’s more in 
the nature of a hypnotic drug, 
but it has a rather peculiar effect. 
It provokes a dream.” 



“A dream?” 

“Yes. An incredibly long and 
detailed dream, in which the 
patient lives an entire lifetime, 
and lives it just the way he 
would like it to be. You might 
say it’s an opiate, but the most 
humane one ever developed.” 

Paula looked down at the still 
figure on the bed. His hand was 
moving slowly across the bed- 
sheet, the fingers groping toward 
her. 

“Andy,” she breathed. “Andy 
darling ...” 

His hand fell across hers, the 
touch feeble and aged. 

“Paula,” he whispered, “say 
goody-by to the children for me.”

1 STOOD in the shadows and 
looked across at the run- 
down lot with the wind- 
blown trash packed against the 
wire mesh barrier fence and the 
yellow glare panel that said 
HAUG ESCORT. There was a 
row of city-scarred hacks parked 
on the cracked ramp. They hadn’t 
suffered the indignity of a wash- 
job for a long time. And the two- 
story frame building behind them 
— that had once been somebody’s 
country house — now showed no 
paint except the foot-high yellow 
letters over the office door. 

Inside the office a short broad 
man with small eyes and yester- 
day’s beard gnawed a cigar and 
looked at me. 

“Portal-to-portal escort cost 
you two thousand C’s,” he said. 
“Guaranteed.” 

“Guaranteed how?” I asked. 
He waved the cigar. “Guaran- 
teed you get into the city and 
back out again in one piece.” He 
studied his cigar. “If somebody 
don’t plug you first,” he added. 
“How about a one-way trip?” 
“My boy got to come back out, 
ain’t he?” 



He was a sort of taxi-driver, 

92 







I had spent my last brass ten- 
dollar piece on a cup of coffee 
eight hours before, but I had to 
get into the city. This was the 
only idea I had left. 

“You’ve got me wrong,” I said. 
“I’m not a customer. I want a 
job.” 

“Yeah?” He looked at me 
again, with a different expression, 
like a guy whose new-found girl 
friend has just mentioned a price. 
“You know Gra’nyauk?” 

“Sure,” I said. “I grew up here.” 
He asked me a few more ques- 
tions, then thumbed a button cen- 
tered in a ring of grime on the 
wall behind him. A chair scraped 
beyond the door; it opened and 
a tall bony fellow with thick 
wrists and an adams apple set 
among heavy neck tendons came 
in. 

The man behind the desk 
pointed at me with his chin. 
“Throw him out, Lefty.” 

Lefty gave me a resentful look, 
came around the desk and 
reached for my collar. I leaned to 
the right asd threw a hard left 
jab to the chin. He rocked back 
and sat down. 

“I get the idea,” I said. “I can 
make it out under my own 
power.” I turned to the door. 

“Stick around, mister. Lefty’s 
just kind of a like test for separat- 
ing the men from the boys.” 
“You mean I’m hired?” 

He sighed. “You come at a 



good time. I’m short of good 
boys.” 

I helped Lefty up, then dusted 
off a chair and listened to a 
half-hour briefing on conditions 
in the city. They weren’t good. 
Then I went upstairs to the chart 
room to wait for a call. 

TT was almost ten o’clock when 

Lefty came into the room 
where I was looking over the 
maps of the city. He jerked his 
head. 

“Hey, you.” 

A weasel-faced man who had 
been blowing smoke in my face 
slid off his stool, dropped his 
cigarette and smeared it under 
his shoe. 

“You,” Lefty said. “The new 

guy-” 

I belted my coat and followed 
him down the dark stairway, and 
out across the littered tarmac, 
glistening wet under the polyarcs, 
to where Haug stood talking to 
another man I hadn’t seen be- 
fore. 

Haug flicked a beady glance 
my way, then turned to the 
stranger. He was a short man of 
about fifty with a mild expres- 
sionless face and expensive 
clothes. 

“Mr. Stenn, this is Smith. He’s 
your escort. You do like he tells 
you and he’ll get you into the 
city and see your party and back 
out again in one piece.”

GALAXY 



The customer looked at me. 
“Considering the fee I’m paying, 
I sincerely hope so,” he mur- 
mured. 

“Smith, you and Mr. Stenn take 
number 16 here.” Haug patted a 
hinge-sprung hood, painted a bil- 
ious yellow and scabbed with 
license medallions issued by half 
a dozen competing city govern- 
ments. 

Haug must have noticed some- 
thing in Stenn’s expression. 

“It ain’t a fancy-looking hack, 
but she’s got full armor, heavy- 
duty gyros, crash-shocks, two-way 
music and panic gear. I ain’t got 
a better hack in the place.” 

Stenn nodded, popped the 
hatch and got in. I climbed in the 
front and adjusted the seat and 
controls to give me a little room. 
When I kicked over the turbos 
they sounded good. 

“Better tie in, Mr. Stenn,” I 
said. “We’ll take the Canada turn- 
pike in. You can brief me on the 
way.” 

I wheeled 16 around and out 
under the glare-sign that read 
"HAUG ESCORT.” In the east- 
bound linkway I boosted her up 
to 90. From the- way the old bus 
stepped off, she had at least a 
megahorse under the hood. 
Maybe Haug wasn’t lying, I 
thought. I pressed an elbow 
against the power pistol strapped 
to my side. 

I liked the feel of it there. 



Maybe between it and old 16 I 
could get there and back after 
all. 

U M Y destination,” Stenn said, 

IYA“is thg Manhattan section.” 

That suited me perfectly. In 
fact, it was the first luck I’d had 
since I burned the uniform. I 
looked in the rear viewer at 
Stenn’s face. He still wore no ex- 
pression. He seemed like a mild 
little man to be wanting into the 
cage with the tigers. 

“That’s pretty rough territory, 
Mr. Stenn,” I said. He didn’t an- 
swer. 

“Not many tourists go there,” 
I went on. I wanted to pry a little 
information from him. 

“I’m a businessman,” Stenn 
said. 

I let it go at that. Maybe he 
knew what he was doing. For me, 
there was no choice. I had one 
slim lead, and I had to play it 
out to the end. I swung through 
the banked curves of the intermix 
and onto the turnpike and opened 
up to full throttle. 

It was fifteen minutes before I 
saw the warning red lights ahead. 
Haug had told me about this. I 
slowed. 

“Here’s our first roadblock, Mr. 
Stenn,” I said. “This is an operator 
named Joe Naples. All he’s after 
is his toll. I’ll handle him; you 
sit tight in the hack. Don’t say 
anything, don’t do anything, no

matter what happens. Under- 
stand?” 

“I understand,” Stenn said 
mildly. 

I pulled up. My lights splashed 
on the spikes of a Mark IX tank 
trap. I set the parking jacks and 
got out. 

“Remember what I told you,” 
I said. “No matter what.” I walk- 
ed up into the beam of the lights. 

A voice spoke from off to the 
side. 

“Douse ’em, Rube.” 

I went back and cut the lights. 
Three men sauntered out onto 
the highway. 

“Keep the hands away from 
the sides, Rube.” 

One 0|f the men was a head 
taller than the others. I couldn’t 
see his face in the faint red light 
from the beacon, but I knew who 
he was. 

“Hello, Naples,” I said. 

He came up to me. “You know 
me, Rube?” 

“Sure,” I said. “The first thing 
Haug told me was pay my res- 
pects to Mr. Naples.” 

Naples laughed. “You hear 
that, boys? They know me pretty 
good on the outside, ha?” 

TTE looked at me, not laughing 
any more. “I don’t see you 
before.” 

“My first trip.” 

He jerked a thumb at the hack. 
“Who’s your trick?” 



“A businessman. Name is 
Stenn.” 

“Yeah? What kind business?” 

I shook my head. “We don’t 
quiz the cash customers, Joe.” 

“Let’s take a look.” Naples 
moved off toward the hack, the 
boys at his side. I followed. Naples 
looked in at Stenn. Stenn sat re- 
laxed and looked straight ahead. 
Naples turned away, nodded to 
one of his helpers. The two moved 
off a few yards. 

The other man, a short bullet- 
headed thug in a grease-spatted 
overcoat, stood by the hack, star- 
ing in at Stenn. He took a heavy 
old-style automatic from his coat 
pocket, pulled open the door. He 
aimed the gun at Stenn’s head 
and carefully squeezed the trig- 
ger. 

The hammer clicked emptily. 

“Ping,” he said. He thrust the 
gun back in his pocket, kicked 
the door shut and went over to 
join Naples. 

“Okay, Rube,” Naples called. 

I went over to him. 

“I guess maybe you on the 
level,” he said. “Standard fee. Five 
hundred, Old Federal notes.” 

I had to be careful now. I 
held a bland expression, reached 
in — slowly — took out my 
wallet. I extracted two hundred- 
C notes and held them out. 

Naples looked at them, unmov- 
ing. The thug in the dirty over- 
coat moved up close, and sud- 

G ALAXY 





denly swung the edge of his palm 
at my wrist. I was ready; I flicked 
my hand aside and chopped him 
hard at the base of the neck. He 
dropped. 

I was still holding out the 
money. 

“That clown isn’t worthy of a 
place in the Naples organization,” 
I said. 

Naples looked down at the 
man, stirred him with his foot 

“A clown,” he said. He took 
the money and tucked it in his 
shirt pocket. 

“Okay, Rube,” he said. “My 
regards to Haug.” 

I got in the hack and moved 
up to the barrier. It started up, 
trundled aside. Naples was bend- 
ing over the man I had downed. 
He took the pistol from the 
pocket of the overcoat, jacked the 
action and aimed. There was a 
sharp crack. The overcoat flopped 
once. Naples smiled over at me. 

“He ain’t worthy a place in the 
Naples organization,” he said. 

I waved a hand vaguely and 
gunned off down the road.

T^HE SPEAKER in my ear 
•*- hummed. 

I grunted an acknowledgement 
and a blurred voice said, “Smith, 
listen. When you cross the South 
Radial, pick up the Midwest 
Feed-off. Take it easy and watch 



THE KING OF THE CITY 



for Number Nine Station, Pull off 
there. Got it?” 

I recognized the voice. It was 
Lefty, Haug’s Number One boy. 
I didn’t answer. 

“What was the call?” Stenn 
asked. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “Noth- 
ing.” 

The lights of the South Radial 
Intermix were in sight ahead now. 

I slowed to a hundred and 
thought about it. My personal 
motives told me to keep going, 
my job as a paid Escort was to 
get my man where he wanted 
to go. That was tough enough, 
without detours. I eased back up 
to one-fifty, took the Intermix 
with gyros screaming, and curved 
out onto the thruway. 

The speaker hummed. “What 
are you trying to pull, wise guy?” 
He sounded mad. “That was the 
South Radial you just passed 
up — ” 

“Yeah,” I said. “That’s right. 
Smitty takes ’em there and he 
brings ’em back. Don’t call us, 
we’ll call you.” 

There was a long hum from 
the speaker. “Oh, a wiseacre,” it 
said finally. “Listen, rookie, you 
got a lot to learn. This guy is 
bankrolled. I seen the wad when 
he paid Haug off. So all right, we 
cut you in. Now, get this . .” 

He gave me detailed instruc- 
tions. When he was finished, I 
said, “Don’t wait up for me.”

I took the speaker out of my 
ear and dropped it into the dis- 
posal slot. We drove along quietly 
for quite a while. 

I was beginning to recognize 
my surroundings. This section of 
the turnpike had been opened 
the year before I left home. Ex- 
cept for the lack of traffic and the 
dark windows along the way it 
hadn’t changed. 

I was wondering just what 
Lefty’s next move would be when 
a pair of powerful beams came on 
from the left, then pulled onto 
the highway, speeding up to pace 
me. I rocketed past before he 
had made full speed. I heard a 
loud spang, and glass chips scat- 
tered on my shoulder. I twisted 
and looked. A starred hole showed 
in the bubble, above the rear 
seat. 

UrUJCK!” I yelled. Stenn 

-^-''leaned over, put his head 
down. 

The beams were gaining on me. 
I twisted the rear viewer, hit the 
I/R switch. A three-ton combat 
car, stripped, but still mounting 
twin infinite repeaters. Against 
that, old 16 was a kiddie car. I 
held my speed and tried to gen- 
erate an idea. What I came up 
with wasn’t good, but it was all 
I had. 

A half a mile ahead there 
should be a level-split, one of 
those awkward ones that caused 



more than one pile-up in the first 
few months the turnpike was 
open. Maybe my playmates didn’t 
know about it. 

They were about to overtake 
me now. I slowed just a little, 
and started fading to the right. 
They followed me, crowding my 
rear wheel. I heard the spang 
again, twice, but nothing hit me. 
I was on the paved shoulder now, 
and could barely see the faded 
yellow cross-hatching that warned 
of the abutment that divided the 
pavement ahead. 

I held the hack in the yellow 
until the last instant, then veered 
right and cleared the concrete 
barrier by a foot, hit the down- 
curve at a hundred and eighty in 
a howl of gyros and brakes — and 
the thunderous impact of the com- 
bat car. 

Then I was off the pavement, 
fighting the wheel, slamming 
through underbrush, then miracu- 
lously back on the hard surface 
and coasting to a stop in the 
clear. 

I took a deep breath and 
looked back. The burning remains 
of the car were scattered for a 
quarter of a mile along the turn- 
pike. That would have been me 
if I had gauged it wrong. 

I looked at the canopy of the 
hack. Three holes, not a foot 
apart, right where a passenger’s 
head would be if he were sitting 
upright. Stenn was unconcernedly 

GALAXY 



brushing glass dust from his 
jacket. 

“Very neat, Mr. Smith,” he 
said. “Now shall we resume our 
journey?” 

“Maybe it’s time you leveled 
with me, Stenn,” I said. 

He raised his eyebrows at me 
slightly. 

“When Joe Naples’ boy Friday 
pointed the gun at your head you 
didn’t bat an eyelash,” I said. 

“I believe those were your 
instructions,” Stenn said mildly. 

“Pretty good for a simple busi- 
nessman. I don’t see you showing 
any signs of the shakes now, 
either, after what some might call 
a harrowing experience.” 

“I have every confidence in 
your handling — ” 

“Nuts, Stenn. Those three holes 
are pretty well grouped, wouldn’t 
you say? The man that put them 
there was hitting where he was 
aiming. And he was aiming for 
you.” 

“Why me?” Stenn looked al- 
most amused. 

“I thought it was a little shake- 
down crew, out to teach me a 
lesson,” I said. “Until I saw 
where the shots were going.” 

Stenn looked at me thought- 
fully. He reached up and took a 
micro-speaker from his ear. 

“The twin to the one you rashly 
disposed of,” he said. “Mr. Haug 
was kind enough to supply it — 
for a fee. I must tell you that I 

THE KING OF THE CITY 



had a gun in my hand as we ap- 
proached the South Radial In- 
termix. Had you accepted the in- 
vitation to turn off, I would have 
halted the car, shot you and gone 
on alone. Happily, you chose to 
resist the temptation, for reasons 
of your own . He looked at me 
inquiringly. 

“Maybe I’m sap enough to take 
the job seriously,” I said. 

“That may possibly be true,” 
Stenn said. 

“What’s your real errand here, 
Stenn? Frankly, I don’t have time 
to get involved.” 

“Really? One wonders if you 
have irons in the fire, Smith. But 
never mind. I shan’t pry. Are 
we going on?” 

I gave him my stern penetrat- 
ing look. 

“Yeah,” I said. “We’re going 
on.” 

TN twenty minutes, we were on 

the Inner Concourse and the 
polyarcs were close together, 
lighting the empty sweep of 
banked pavement. The lights of 
the city sparkled across the sky 
ahead, and gave me a ghostly 
touch of the old thrill of com- 
ing home. 

I doused that feeling fast. After 
eight years there was nothing left 
there for me to come home to. 
The city had a lethal welcome for 
intruders; it wouldn’t be smart 
to forget that.

I didn’t see the T-Bird until 
his spot hit my eyes and he was 
beside me, crowding. 

I veered and hit the brakes, 
with a half-baked idea of drop- 
ping back and cutting behind 
him, but he stayed with me. I 
had a fast impression of squeal- 
ing metal and rubber, and then I 
was skidding to a stop up against 
the deflector rails with the T- 
Bird slanted across my prow. Its 
lid popped almost before the 
screech died away, and I was 
looking down the muzzles of two 
power pistols. I kept both hands 
on the wheel, where they could 
see them, and sat tight. 

I wondered whose friends we 
had, met this time. 

Two men climbed out, the pis- 
tols in sight, and came up to the 
hack. The first one was a heavy- 
set Slavic type zipped into a 
tight G. I. weather suit. He mo- 
tioned. I opened up and got out, 
not making any sudden move- 
ments. Stenn followed. A cold 
wind was whipping along the con- 
course, blowing a fine misty rain 
hard against my cheek. The poly- 
arcs cast black shadows on gray 
faces. 

The smaller man moved over 
to Stenn and crowded him back 
against the hack. The Slav mo- 
tioned again, and I moved over 
by the T-Bird. He fished my 
wallet out and put it in his 
pocket without looking at it. I 



heard the other man say some- 
thing to Stenn, and then the 
sound of a blow. I turned my head 
slowly, so as not to excite my 
watchdog. Stenn was picking him- 
self up. He started going through 
his pockets, showing everything 
to the man with the gun, then 
dropping it on the ground. The 
wind blew cards and papers along 
until they soaked up enough 
water to stick. Stenn carried a lot 
of paper. 

T HE gunny said something and 
Stenn started pulling off his 
coat. He turned it inside out, and 
held it out. The gunny shook his 
head, and motioned to my Slav. 
He looked at me, and I tried to 
read his mind. I moved across 
toward the hack. I must have 
guessed right because he didn’t 
shoot me. The Slav pocketed his 
gun and took the coat. Methodic- 
ally, he tore the lining out, found 
nothing, dropped the ripped gar- 
ment and kicked it aside. I shifted 
position, and the Slav turned and 
backhanded me up against the 
hack. 

“Lay off him, Heavy,” the 
other hood said. “Maxy didn’t say 
nothing about this mug. He’s just 
a Escort.” 

Heavy started to get his gun 
out again. I had an idea he was 
thinking about using it. Maybe 
that’s why I did what I did. As 
his hand dipped into his pocket,

GALAXY 



I lunged, wrapped an arm around 
him and yanked out my own 
artillery. I held onto a handful 
of the weather suit and dug the 
pistol in hard. He stood frozen. 
Heavy wasn’t as dumb as he 
looked. 

His partner had backed a step, 
the pistol in his hand covering all 
of us. 

“Drop it, Slim,” I said. “No 
hard feelings, and we’ll be on our 
way.” 

Stenn stood absolutely motion- 
less. He was still wearing his 
mild expression. 

“Not a ' chance, mug,” the 
gunny said softly. No one moved. 

“Even if you’re ready to gun 
your way through your pal, I 
can’t miss. Better settle for a 
draw.” 

“Maxy don’t like draws, mis- 
ter.” 

“Stenn,” I said. “Get in the T- 
Bird. Head back the way we 
came, and don’t slow down to 
read any billboards.” 

Stenn didn’t move. 

46^ ET going,” I said. ‘-‘Slim 
won’t shoot.” 

“I employed you,” Stenn said, 
“to take care of the heroics.” 

“If you’ve got any better ideas 
it’s time to speak up, Stenn. This 
is your only out, the way I see 
it." 

Stenn looked at the man with 
the gun. 



“You referred to someone 
named ‘Maxy.’ Would that by 
any chance be Mr. Max Arena?” 

Slim looked at him and thought 
about it. 

“Could be,” he said. 

Stenn came slowly over to the 
Slav. Standing well out of the line 
of fire, he carefully put a hand in 
the loose pocket of the weather 
suit and brought out the pistol. 
I saw Slim’s eyes tighten. He was 
having to make some tough deci- 
sions in a hurry. 

Stenn moved offside, pistol in 
hand. 

“Move away from him, Smith,” 
he said. 

I didn’t know what he had in 
mind, but it didn’t seem like the 
time to argue. I moved back. 

“Drop your gun,” he said. 

I risked a glance at his mild 
expression. 

“Are- you nuts?” 

“I came here to see Mr. Arena,” 
he said. “This seems an excel- 
lent opportunity.” 

“Does it? I — ” 

“Drop it now, Smith. I won’t 
warn you again.” 

I dropped it. 

Slim swiveled on Stenn. He 
was still in an awkward spot. 

“I want you to take me to 
Mr. Arena,” Stenn said. “I have a 
proposition to put before him.” 
He lowered the gun and handed 
it to Heavy. 

It seemed like a long time 



THE KING OF THE CITY

until Slim lowered his gun. 

“Heavy, put him in the back 
seat.” He motioned me ahead, 
watched me as he climbed in the 
T-Bird. 

“Nice friends you got, mug,” he 
said. The T-Bird started up, 
backed, and roared off toward the 
city. I stood under the polyarcs 
and watched the tail glare out 
of sight. 

Max Arena was the man I had 
come to the city to find. 

Ill 

O LD number 16 was canted 
against the deflector rail, one 
side shredded into curled strips 
of crumpled metal. I looked 
closer. Under the flimsy fairings, 
gray armor showed. Maybe there 
was more to Hang’s best hack 
than met the eye. I climbed in 
and kicked over the starter. The 
turbos sounded as good as ever. 

I eased the gyros in; she backed 
off the rail with a screech of rip- 
ped metal. 

I had lost my customer, but I 
still had wheels. 

The smart thing to do now 
would be to head back out the 
turnpike to Haug’s lot, turn in my 
badge and keep moving, south. I 
could give up while I was still 
alive. All I had to do was accept 
the situation. 

I had a wide choice. I could 
sign on with the New Confeds, or 

102 



the Free Texans, or any one of 
the other splinter republics try- 
ing to set up shop in the power 
vacuum. I might try to get in to 
one of the Enclaves and convince 
its Baron he needed another 
trained bodyguard. Or I could 
take a post with one of the king- 
pins in the city. 

As a last resort I could go 
back and find a spot in the Naples 
organization. I happened to know 
they had a vacancy. 

I was just running through 
mental exercises to hear myself 
think. I couldn’t settle for the 
kind of world I had found when 
I touched planet three months 
back, after eight years in deep 
space with Hayle’s squadron. 
When the Interim Administration 
shot him for treason, I burned my 
uniform and disappeared. My 
years in the Service had given 
me a tough hide and a knack for 
staying alive; my worldly assets 
consisted of the clothes I stood in, 
my service pistol and a few 
souvenirs of my travels. For two 
months I had been scraping along 
on the cash I had in my pocket, 
buying drinks for drifters in cheap 
bars, looking for a hint, any lead 
at all, that would give me a 
chance to do what had to be 
done. Max Arena was the lead. 
Maybe a dud lead — but I had 
to find out. 

The city lights loomed just a 
few miles away. I was wasting 

GALAXY 



time sitting here; I steered the 
hack out into the highway and 
headed for them. 

A PPARENTLY Lefty’s influ- 
■**-ence didn’t extend far beyond 
the South Radial. The two road- 
blocks I passed in the next five 
miles took my money, accepted 
my story that I was on my way 
to pick up a fare, said to say hello 
to Haug and passed me on my 
way. 

Haug’s sour yellow color 
scheme seemed to carry some 
weight with the town Organiza- 
tions, too. I was well into the 
city, cruising along the third level 
Crossover, before I had any 
trouble. I was doing about fifty, 
watching where I was going and 
looking for the Manhattan Inter- 
mix, when a battered Gyrob four- 
seater trundled out across the 
fairway and stopped. I swerved 
and jumped lanes; the Gyrob 
backed, blocking me. I kicked my 
safety frame down and floor- 
boarded the hack, steering 
straight for him. At the last in- 
stant he tried to pull out of the 
way. 

He was too late. 

I clipped him across his aft 
quarter, and caught a glimpse of 
the underside of the car as it 
stood on its nose, slammed 
through the deflector and over 
the side. Old 16 bucked and I 
got a good crack across the jaw 

THE KING OF THE CITY 



from the ill-fitting frame, and 
then I was screeching through the 
Intermix and out onto the Man- 
hattan Third level. 

Up ahead, the glare panels at 
the top of the Blue Tower reared 
up half a mile into the wet night 
sky. It wasn’t a hard address to 
find. Getting inside would be 
another matter. 

I pulled up a hundred yards 
from the dark cave they used to 
call the limousine entrance and 
looked the situation over. The 
level was deserted — like the 
whole city seemed, from the 
street. But there were lights in 
the windows, level after level of 
them stretching up and away as 
far as you could see. There were 
plenty of people in the city — 
about ten million, even after the 
riots and the Food Scare and 
the collapse of legal government. 
The automated city supply sys- 
tem had gone on working, and 
the Kingpins, the big time crimi- 
nals, had stepped in and set things 
up to suit their tastes. Life went 
on — but not out in the open. Not 
after dark. 

I knew almost nothing about 
Arena. Judging from his em- 
ployees, he was Kingpin of a pros- 
perous outfit. The T-Bird was an 
expensive late model, and the 
two thugs handled themselves 
like high-priced talent. I couldn’t 
expect to walk into his HQ with- 
out jumping a few hurdles. Maybe 

103 



I should have invited myself along 
with Stenn and his new friends. 
On the other hand, there were 
advantages to arriving unan- 
nounced. 

It was a temptation to drive in, 
with the hack’s armor between 
me and any little surprises that 
might be waiting, but I liked the 
idea of staging a surprise of my 
own. I eased into drive and moved 
along to a parking ramp, swung 
around and down and stopped in 
the shadow of the retaining wall. 

I set the brake and took a good 
look around. There was nothing 
in sight. Arena might have a 
power cannon trained on me from 
his bedroom window, for all I 
knew, but I had to get a toe into 
the water sometime. I shut down 
the turbo, and in the silence 
popped the lid and stepped out. 
The rain had stopped, and the 
mcon showed as a bright spot 
on the high mist. I felt hungry 
and a little bit unreal, as though 
this were happening to somebody 
else. 

T moved over to the side of the 

parking slab, clambered over 
the deflector rail and studied the 
shadows under the third level 
roadway. I could barely make out 
the catwalks and service ways. I 
was wondering whether to pull 
off my hard-soled shoes for the 
climb when I heard footsteps, 
close. I gauged the distance to 



the hack, and saw I couldn’t 
make it. I got back over the rail 
and waited. 

He came into sight, rangy, 
shock-haired and preternaturally 
thin in tight traditional dress. 

When he got close I saw that 
he was young, in his early twen- 
ties at most. He would be carry- 
ing a knife. 

“Hey, Mister,” he whined. “Got 
a cigarette?” 

“Sure, young fellow,” I said, 
sounding a little nervous. I threw 
in a shaky laugh to help build the 
picture. I took a cigarette from 
a pack, put the pack back in my 
pocket, held the weed out. He 
strutted up to me, reached out 
and flipped the cigarette from 
my fingers. I edged back and 
used the laugh again. 

“Hey, he liked that,” the punk 
Whined. “He thinks that’s funny. 
He got a sense of humor.” 

“Heh, heh,” I said. “Just out 
getting a little air.” 

“Gimme another cigarette, 
funny man.” 

I took the pack out, watching. 
I got out a cigarette and held it 
gingerly, arm bent. As he reached 
for it, I drew back. He snatched 
for it. That put him in position. 

I dropped the pack, clenched 
my two hands together, ducked 
down and brought them up hard 
under his chin. He backflipped, 
rolled over and started crawling. 

I let him go. 




I went over the rail without 
stopping to think it over and 
crossed the girder to the catwalk 
that ran under the boulevard 
above. I groped my way along to 
where the service way branched 
off for the Blue Tower, then 
stopped and looked up. A strip 
of luminous sky showed between 
the third level and the facade of 
the building. Anybody watching 
from the right spot would see mfe 
cross, walking on the narrow foot- 
way. It was a chance I’d have to 
take. I started to move out, and 
heard running feet. I froze. 

The feet slid to a stop on the 
level above, a few yards away. 

“What’s up, Crackers?” some- 
body growled. 

“The mark sapped me down.” 

fT'HAT was interesting. I had 
been spotted and the punk 
had been sent to welcome me. 
Now I knew where I stood. The 
opposition had made their first 
mistake. 

“He was starting to cross under 
when I spot him,” Crackers went 
on, breathing heavily. “He saps 
me and I see I can’t handle him 
and I go for help.” 

Someone answered in a gut- 
tural whisper. Crackers lowered 
his voice. It wouldn’t take long 
now for reinforcements to arrive 
and flush me out. I edged farther 
and chanced a look. I saw two 
heads outlined above. They didn’t 



seem to be looking my way, so I 
started across, walking silently 
toward a narrow loading plat- 
form with a wide door opening 
from it. 

Below me, a lone light reflected 
from the wet pavement of the 
second level, fifty feet down; the 
blank wall of the Blue Tower 
dropped past it sheer to the glis- 
tening gutters at ground level. 
Then I was on the platform and 
trying the door. 

It didn’t open. 

It was what I should have ex- 
pected. Standing in the full light 
from the glare panel above the 
entry, I felt as exposed as a fan- 
dancer’s navel. There was no 
time to consider alternatives. I 
grabbed my power pistol, flipped 
it to beam fire and stood aside 
with an arm across my face. I 
gave the latch a blast, then kicked 
the door hard. It was solid as a 
rock. Behind and above me, I 
heard Crackers yell. 

I beamed the lock again, tiny 
droplets of molten metal spatter- 
ing like needles against my face 
and hand. The door held. 

“Drop it and lift ’em, mug,” a 
deep voice yelled. I twisted to 
look up at the silhouettes against 
the deflector rail. I recognized 
the Slavic face of the man called 
Heavy. So he could talk after all. 

“You’re under my iron, mug,” 
he called. “Freeze or I’ll burn 
you.” 



104

THE KING OF THE CITY 



105 



I believed him, but I had set 
something in motion that couldn’t 
stop now. There was nothing to 
go back to; the only direction for 
me was on the way I was headed 
— deeper into trouble. I was 
tired of being the mouse in a 
cat’s game. I had taken the initia- 
tive and I was keeping it. 

I turned, set the power pistol 
at full aperture, and poured it 
to the armored door. Searing heat 
reflected from the barrier, smoke 
boiled, metal melted and ran. 
Through the stink of burning 
steel, I smelled scorched hair — 
and felt heat rake the back of 
my neck and hands. Heavy was 
beaming me at wide aperture, but 
the range was just too far for a 
fast kill. The door sagged and fell 
in. I jumped through the glow- 
ing opening, hit the floor and 
rolled to damp out my smoulder- 
ing coat. 

T got to my feet. There was no 

time now to stop and feel the 
pain of my burns. They would 
expect me to go up — so I would 
go down. The Blue Tower coh- 
ered four city blocks and was four 
hundred stories high. There was 
plenty of room in it for a man to 
lose himself. 

I ran along the corridor, found 
a continuous service belt and 
hopped on, lay flat, rode it 
through the slot. I came out into 
the light of the service corridor 



below, my gun ready, then down 
and around again. I saw no one. 

It took ten minutes to cover 
the eighteen floors down to the 
sub-basement. I rolled off the belt 
and looked around. 

The whole space was packed 
with automatics; the Blue Tower 
was a self-sufficient city in itself. 
I recognized generators, heat 
pumps, air plants. None of them 
were operating. The city services 
were all still functioning, appar- 
ently. What it would be like in 
another ten or twenty years of 
anarchy was anybody’s guess. 
But when the city systems failed 
the Blue Tower could go on on 
its own. 

Glare panels lit the aisles 
dimly. I prowled along looking 
for an elevator bank. The first 
one I found indicated the car at 
the hundred-eightieth floor. I 
went on, found another indicat- 
ing the twentieth. While I 
watched, the indicator moved, 
started down. I was getting ready 
to duck when it stopped at the 
fifth. I waited; it didn’t move. 

I went around to the side of 
the bank, found the master 
switch. I went back, punched for 
the car. When the door whooshed 
open, I threw the switch. 

I had to work fast now. I 
stepped into the dark car, reached 
up and slid open the access panel 
in the top, then jumped, caught 
the edge and pulled myself up. 



106 



GALAXY 




The glare panels inside the shaft 
showed me the pony power pack 
on top of the car, used by repair- 
men and inspectors when the 
main power was off. I lit a per- 
match to read the fine print on 
the panel. I was in luck. It was a 
through car to the four-hundredth. 
I pushed a couple of buttons, and 
the car started up. I lay flat be- 
hind the machinery. 

As the car passed the third 
floor feet came into view; two 
men stood beyond the transparent 
door, guns in their hands, watch- 
ing the car come up. They didn’t 
see me. One of them thumbed the 
button frantically. The car kept 
going. 

There were men at almost 
every floor now. I went on up, 
passed the hundredth floor, the 
one-fiftieth, and kept going. I 
began to feel almost safe — for 
the moment. 

T was gambling now on what 

little I knew of the Blue Tower 
from the old days when all the 
biggest names congregated there. 
The top floor was a lavish apart- 
ment that had been occupied by 
a retired fleet admiral, a Vice- 
President and a uranium million- 
aire, in turn. If I knew anything 
about Kingpins, that’s where Max 
Arena would hang his hat. 

The elevator was slow. Lying 
there I had time to start think- 
ing about my burned hide. My 



scalp was hit worst, and then my 
hands; and my shoulders were 
sticking to the charred coat. I 
had been travelling on adrenalin 
since Heavy had beamed me, and 
now the reaction was starting to 
hit. 

It would have to wait; I had 
work to do. 

Just below the three hundred 
and ninety-eighth floor I punched 
the button and the car stopped. 
I stood up, feeling dizzy. I grab- 
bed for the rungs on the wall, 
hung on. The wall of the shaft 
seemed to sway . back . 

Sure, I told myself. The top of 
the building sways fifteen feet in 
a high wind. Why shouldn’t I 
feel it? I dismissed the thought 
that it was dead calm outside 
now, and started up the ladder. 

It was a hard climb. I hung on 
tight, and concentrated on mov- 
ing one hand at a time. The collar 
of my coat rasped my raw neck. 
I passed up the 398th and 9th 
— and rammed my head smack 
against a dead end. No service 
entry to the penthouse. I backed 
down to the 399th. 

I found the lever and eased 
the door open, then waited, gun 
in hand. Nothing happened. I 
couldn’t wait any longer. I 
pushed the door wide, stepped 
off into the hall. Still nobody in 
sight, but I could hear voices. To 
my left a discreet stair carpeted 
in violet velvet eased up in a 

GALAXY 



gentle curve. I didn’t hesitate; I 
went up. 

The door at the top was an 
austere slab of bleached teak. I 
tried the polished brass lever; the 
door swung open silently, and I 
stepped across the threshold and 
was looking across a plain of 
honey-colored down at a man 
sitting relaxed in a soft chair of 
pale leather. 

He waved a hand cheerfully. 
“Come on in,” he said. 

IV 

TI/TAX Arena was a broad- 
shouldered six-footer, with 
clean-shaven blue jaws, coarse 
gray-flecked black hair brushed 
back from a high forehead, a 
deeper tan than was natural for 
the city in November, and very 
white teeth. He was showing 
them now in a smile. He waved 
a hand toward a chair, not even 
glancing at the gun in my hand. 

I admired the twinkle of light on 
the polished barrel of a Norge 
stunner at his elbow and decided 
to ignore it too. 

“I been following your prog- 
ress with considerable interest,” 
Arena said genially. “The boys 
had orders not to shoot. I guess 
Luvitch sort of lost his head.” 

“It’s nothing,” I said, “that a 
little skin graft won’t clear up in 
a year or so.” 

“Don’t feel bad. You’re the 

THE KING OF THE CITY 



first guy ever made it in here 
under his own steam without an 
invitation.” 

“And with a gun in his hand,” 
I said. 

“We won’t need guns,” he said. 
“Not right away.” 

.1 went over to one of the big 
soft chairs and sat down, put the 
gun in my lap. 

“Why didn’t you shoot as I 
came in?” 

Arena jiggled his foot. “I like 
your style,” he said. “You handled 
Heavy real good. He’s supposed 
to be my toughest boy.” 

“What about the combat car? 
More friends of yours?” 

“Nah,” he said, chuckling 
easily. “Some Jersey boys heard I 
had a caller. They figured to 
knock him off on general princi- 
ples. A nifty.” He stopped laugh- 
ing. “The Gyrob was mine; a 
remoted job. Nice piece of equip- 
ment. You cost me real dough 
tonight.” 

“Gee,” I said. “That’s tough.” 

“And besides,” he said, “I know 
who you are.” 

I waited. He leaned over and 
picked something off the table. It 
was my wallet. 

“I used to be in the Navy my- 
self. Academy man, believe it or 
not. Almost, anyway. Kicked out 
three w r eeks before graduation. A 
frame. Well, practically a frame; 
there was plenty of guys doing 
what I was doing.” 



108

“That where you learned to 

talk like a hood?” 

For a second Arena almost 

didn’t smile. 

“I am perfectly capable of ex- 
pressing myself like a little gen- 
tleman, when I feel so inclined, 
he said, “but I say to hell with 
it.” 

“You must have been before 
my time,” I said. 

“A year or two. And I was 
using a different name then. But 
that wasn’t my only hitch with 
the Service. When the Trouble 
started, I enlisted. I wanted some 
action. When the Navy found 
out they had a qualified Power 
Section man on their hands, I 
went up fast. Within fourteen 
months I was a J. G. How about 
that?” 

“Very commendable. 

“So that’s how I knew about 
the trick I. D. under the emul- 
sion on the snapshot. You should 
have ditched it, Maclamore. Or 
should I say Captain Macla- 
more?” 

M Y mouth opened, but I 
couldn’t think of a snappy 
answer to that one. I was in 
trouble. I had meant to play it 
by ear once I reached Arena to 
get the information I needed. 
That was out now. He knew me. 
He had topped my aces before 
I played them. 

Suddenly Arena was serious. 



“You came to the right man, 
Maclamore. You heard I had one 
of your buddies here, right? I let 
the word leak; I thought it might 
bring more of you in. I was lucky 
to get Admiral Hayle’s deputy.” 
“What do you want with me?” 
Arena leaned forward. “There 
were eight of you. Hayle and his 
aide, Wolfgang, were shot when 
they wouldn’t spill to the Provi- 
sional Government — or what- 
ever that mob calls itself. Margan 
got himself killed in some kind 
of tangle near Denver. The other 
four boys pulled a fast one and 
ducked out with the scout you 
guys came back in. They were 
riding dry tanks — the scout had 
maybe thirty ton/hours fuel 
aboard — so they haven’t left 
the planet. That leaves you 
stranded. "N^/ith six sets of Federal 
law looking for you. Right?” 

“I can’t argue with what’s in 
the newspapers,” I said. 

“Well, I don’t know. I got a 
couple newspapers. But here’s 
where I smell a deal, Maclamore. 
You want to know where that 
scout boat is. Played right, you 
figure you got a good chance of a 
raid on an arsenal or a power 
plant to pick up a few slugs of 
the heavy stuff; then you high- 
tail out, join up with the rest 
of the squadron and, with the 
ordnance you pack, you can sit 
off and dictate the next move.” 
Arena leaned back and took a

GALAXY 



deep breath. His eyes didn’t leave 
me. 

Okay. I got one of you here. 
I found out something from him. 
He gave me enough I know you 
boys got something up your 
sleeve. But he don’t have the 
whole picture. I need more info. 
You can give it to me. If I like 
what I hear, I’m in a position to 
help — like, for example, with 
the fuel problem. And you cut 
me in for half. Fair enough?” 
“Who is it you’ve got?” 

He shook his head. “Uh-uh.” 
“What did he tell you?” 

“Not enough. What was Hayle 
holding out? You birds found 
something out there. What was 
it?” 

“We found a few artifacts on 
Mars, I said. “Not Martian in 
origin; visitors. We surveyed — ” 
Don t string me, Maclamore. 
I’m willing to give you a fair deal, 
but if you make it tough for 
me — ” 

“How do you know I haven’t 
got a detonator buried under my 
left ear, I said. “You can’t pry 
information out of me, Arena.” 

“I think you want to live, 
Maclamore. I think you got some- 
thing you want to live for. I 
want a piece of it.” 

“I can make a deal with you, 
Arena, I said. “Return me and 
my shipmate to our scout boat. 
Fuel us up. You might throw in 
two qualified men to help handle 

THE KING OF THE CITY 



the ship — minus their black- 
jacks, preferably — then clear 
out. We’ll handle the rest. And 
I’ll remember, with gratitude.” 
Arena was silent for a long 
moment. 

UyEAH, I could do that, 
A Maclamore,” he said fin- 
ally. “But I won’t. Max Arena is 
not a guy to pick up the crumbs 
or wait around for handouts. 
I want in. All the way in.” 

“This time you’ll have to settle 
for what you can get, Arena.” I 
put the gun away and stood up. 

I had a feeling I would have to 
put it over now or not at all. 

The rest of the squadron is 
still out there. If we don’t show, 
they’ll carry on alone. They’re 
supplied for a century’s opera- 
tion. They don’t need us.” 

That was true up to a point. 
The squadron had everything — 
except fuel. 

“You figure you got it made if 
you can get your hands on that 
scout-boat,” Arena said. “You 
figure to pick up fuel pretty easy 
by knocking off say the Lacka- 
wanna Pile.” 

It shouldn’t be too tough; a 
fleet boat of the Navy packs a 
wallop.” 

Arena tapped his teeth with a 
slim paper-cutter. 

“You’re worried your outfit will 
wind up Max Arena’s private 
Navy, right? I’ll tell you some- 

ill 



thing. You think I’m sitting on 
top of the world, huh? I own this 
town, and everybody in it. All 
the luxury and fancy dinners and 
women I can use. And you know 
what? I’m bored.” 

“And you think running the 
Navy might be diverting?” 

“Call it whatever you want to. 
There’s something big going on 
out there, and I don’t plan to be 
left out.” 

“Arena, when I clear atmos- 
phere, we’ll talk. Take it or leave 
it.” 

The smile was gone now. 
Arena looked at me, rubbing a 
finger along his blue cheek. 

“Suppose I was to tell you I 
know where your other three boys 
are, Maclamore?” 

“Do you?” I said. 

“And the boat,” Arena said. 
“The works.” 

“If you’ve got them here, I 
want to see them, Arena. If not, 
don’t waste my time.” 

“I haven’t exactly got ’em here, 
Maclamore. But I know a guy 
that knows where they are.” 
“Yeah.” I said. 

Arena looked mad. “Okay, I’ll 
give it to you, Maclamore. I 
got a partner in this deal. Be- 
tween us we got plenty. But we 
need what you got, too.” 

“I’ve made my offer, Arena. It 
stands.” 

“Have I got your word on that, 
Maclamore?” He stood up and 



came over to stand before me. 
“The old Academy word. You 
wouldn’t break that, would you 
Maclamore?” 

“I’ll do what I said.” 

Arena walked to his desk, a 
massive boulder of Jadeite, 
cleaved and polished to a mirror 
surface. He thumbed a key. 

“Send him in here,” he said. 

I waited. Arena sat down and 
looked across at me. 

Thirty seconds passed and then 
the door opened and Stenn 
walked in. 

S TENN glanced at me. 

“Well,” he said. “Mr. Smith.” 
“The Smith routine is just a 
gag,” Arena said. “His name is — 
Maclamore.” 

For an instant, I thought I saw 
a flash of expression on Stenn’s 
face. He crossed the room and 
sat down. 

“Well,” he said. “A very ra- 
tional move, your coming here. I 
trust you struck a profitable bar- 
gain?” He looked hard at me, and 
this time there was expression. 
Hate, I would call it, offhand. 

“Not much of a deal at that, 
Stenn,” Arena said. “The captain 
is a tough nut to crack. He wants 
my help with no strings attached. 
I think I’m going to buy it.” 
“How much information has he 
given you?” 

Arena laughed. “Nothing,” he 
said. “Max Arena going for a 

GALAXY 



deal like that. Funny, huh? But 
that’s the way the fall-out fogs 
’em.” 

“And what have you ar- 
ranged?” 

“I turn him loose, him and Wil- 
liams. I figure you’ll go along, 
Stenn, and let him have the three 
guys you got. Williams will tell 
him where the Scout boat is, so 
there’s no percentage in your 
holding out.” 

“What else?” 

“What else is there?” Arena 
spread his hands. “They pick up 
the boat, fuel up — someplace — 
and they’re off. And the captain 
here gives me the old Academy 
word he cuts me in, once he’s 
clear.” 

There was a long silence. Arena 
smiled comfortably; Stenn sat 
calmly, looking at each of us in 
turn. I crossed my fingers and 
tried to look bored. 

“Very well,” Stenn said. “I 
seem to be presented with a fait 
accompli . 

I let a long breath out. I was 
going to make it . 

“• • • But I would suggest that 
before committing yourself, you 
take the precaution of searching 
Mr. Maclamore’s person. One 
never knows.” 

I could feel the look on my 
face. So could Arena. 

“So,” he said. “Another nifty.” 
He didn’t seem to move, but the 
stunner was in his hand. He 

THE KING OF THE CITY 



wasn’t smiling now, and the 
stunner caught me easily. 

V 

T^HE lights came on, and I 
blinked, looking around the 
room. 

My mementos didn’t look like 
much, resting in the center of 
Arena’s polished half-acre of desk 
top. The information was stored 
in the five tiny rods, less than an 
inch long, and the projector was a 
flat polyhedron the size of a pill- 
box. But the information they 
contained was worth more than 
all the treasure sunk in all the 
seas. 

“This is merely a small sample,” 
Stenn said. “The star surveys are 
said to be unbelievably complete. 
They represent a mapping task 
which would require a thousand 
years.” 

“The angles,” Arena said. “Just 
figuring the angles will take 
plenty time.” 

“And this is what you almost 
let him walk out with,” Stenn 
said. 

Arena gave me a slashing look, 
“Don’t let your indignation run 
away with you, Arena,” Stenn 
said. “I don’t think you remem- 
bered to mention the fuel situa- 
tion to Mr. Maclamore, did you?” 
Arena turned to Stenn, looming 
over the smaller man. “Maybe 
you better button your lip,” he 



112 



113 



said quietly. “I don’t like the way 
you use it.” 

“Afraid I’ll lower you in the 
gentleman’s esteem?” Stenn said. 
He looked Arena in the eye. 

“Nuts to the gentleman’s 
esteem,” Arena said. 

“You thought you’d squeeze me 
out, Arena,” Stenn said. ‘ You 
didn’t need me any more. You 
intended to let Maclamore and 
Williams go and have them fol- 
lowed. There was no danger of 
an escape, since you knew they’d 
find no fuel.” 

He turned to me. “During your 
years in space, Mr. Maclamore, 
technology moved on. And poli- 
tics as well. Power fuels could be 
used to construct bombs. Ergo, all 
stations were converted for short 
half-life secondaries, and the 
primary materials stored at Fort 
Knox. You would have found 
yourself fuelless and therefore 
helpless. Mr. Arena would have 
arrived soon thereafter to seize 
the scout-boat.” 

“What would he want with the 
boat without fuel?” I asked. 

“Mr. Arena was foresighted 
enough to stock up some years 
ago,” Stenn said. “I understand 
he has enough metal hoarded to 
power your entire squadron for 
an indefinite time.” 

“Why tell this guy that?” Arena 
asked. “Kick him to hell out of 
here and let’s get busy. You gab 
too much.” 



“I see that I’m tacitly rein- 
stated as a partner,” Stenn said. 
“Most gratifying.” 

“Max Arena is no welcher,” 
Arena said. “You tipped me to 
the tapes, so you’re in.” 

“Besides which you perhaps 
sense that I have other valuable 
contributions to make.” 

“I figure you to pull your 
weight.” 

“What are your plans for Mr. ; 
Maclamore?” 

“I told you. Kick him out. He’ll 
never wise up and cooperate with 
us.” 

“First, you’d better ask him a 
few more questions.” 

“Why? So he’ll blow his head 
off and mess up my rug, like . .” 
Arena stopped. “You won’t get 
anything out of him.” 

“A man of his type has a strong 
aversion to suicide. He won’t die 
to protect trivial information. And 
if he does — we’ll know there’s 
something important being held 
out.” 

“I don’t like messy stuff,” Arena 
said. 

“I’ll be most careful,” Stenn 
said. “Get me some men in here 
to secure him to a chair, and we’ll 
have a nice long chat with him.” -. 

“No messy stuff,” Arena re- 
peated. He crossed to his desk, 
thumbed a lever and spoke to = 
someone outside. 

Stenn was standing in front of 
me. 




“Let him think he’s pumping 
you,” he hissed. 

“Find out where his fuel is 
stored. I’m on your side.” Then 
Arena was coming back, and 
Stenn was looking at me indif- 
ferently. 

A RENA had overcome his aver- 
sion to messy stuff sufficiently 
to hit me in the mouth now and 
then during the past few hours. It 
made talking painful, but I kept 
at it. 

“How do I know you have Wil- 
liams?” I said. 

Arena crossed to his desk, took 
out a defaced snapshot. 

“Here’s his I. D.” he said. 
“Take a look.” He tossed it over. 
Stenn held it up. 

“Let me talk to him.” 

“For what?” 

“See how he feels about it,” I 
mumbled. I was having trouble 
staying awake. I hadn’t seen a 
bed for three days. It was hard 
to remember what information I 
was supposed to get from Arena. 

“He’ll join in if you do,” Arena 
said. “Give up. Don’t fight. Let it 
happen.” 

“You say you’ve got fuel. 
You’re a liar. You’ve got no 
fuel.” 

“I got plenty fuel, wise guy,” 
Arena yelled. He was tired too. 

“Lousy crook,” I said. “Can’t 
even cheat a little without getting 
caught at it.” 



GALAXY 



THE KING 



OF THE CITY 



“Who’s caught now, swabbie?” 
Arena was getting mad. That 
suited me. 

“You’re a lousy liar, Arena. 
You can’t hide hot metal. Even 
Stenn ought to know that.” 
“What else was in the cache, 
Maclamore?” Stenn asked — for 
the hundredth time. He slapped 
— also for the hundredth 
time. It jarred me and stung. It 
was the last straw. If Stenn was 
acting, I’d help him along. I 
lunged against the wires, swung 
a foot and caught him under the 
ribs. He oofed and fell off his 
chair. 

“Don’t push me any farther, 
you small-time chiselers,” I 
yelled. “You’ve got nothing but a 
cast brass gall to offer. There’s 
no hole deep enough to hide out 
power metal, even if a dumb slob 
like you thought of it.” 

“Dumb slob?” Arena barked. 
“You think a dumb slob could 
have built the organization I did, 
put this town in his hip pocket? 

I started stock-piling metal five 
years ago — a year before the 
ban. No hole deep enough, huh? 
It don’t need to be so deep when 
it’s got two feet of lead shielding 
over it.” 

“So you smuggled a few tons 
of lead into the Public Library 
and filed it under Little Bo Peep.” 
“The two feet was there ahead 
of me, wisenheimer. Remember 
the Polaris sub that used to be 



114 



115 



drydocked at Norfolk for the 
tourists to rubberneck?” 

“Decommissioned and sold for 
scrap,” I said. “Years ago.” 

“But not scrapped. Rusted in a 
scrapyard for five years. Then I 
bought her — beefed up her 
shielding — loaded her and sank 
her in ten fathoms of water in 
Cartwright Bay.” 

“That,” Stenn said, “is the in- 
formation we need.” 

Arena whirled. Stenn was still 
sitting on the floor. He had a 
palm gun in his hand, and it was 
pointed at the monogram on 
Arena’s silk shirt. 

“A cross,” Arena said. “A lousy 
cross . .” 

44 M OVE back, Arena.” Stenn 
got to his feet, eyes on 

Arena. 

“Where’d you have the stinger 
stashed?” 

“In my hand. Stop there.” 
Stenn moved over to me. Eyes 
on Arena, he reached for the 
twisted ends of wire, started 
loosening them. 

“I don’t want to be nosey,” I 
said. “But just where the hell do 
you fit into this, Stenn?” 

“Naval Intelligence,” Stenn 
said. 

Arena cursed. “I knew that 
name should have rung a bell. 
Vice Admiral Stenn. The papers 
said you got yours when the Navy 
was purged.” 



“A few of us eluded the net.” 

Arena heaved a sigh. 

“Well, fellows,” he said — and 
jumped. 

Stenn’s shot went wild, and 
Arena left-hooked him down be- 
hind the chair. As he followed, 
Stenn came up fast, landed a 
hard left, followed up, drove 
Arena back. I yanked at my wires. 
Almost — 

Then Arena, a foot taller, ham- 
mered a brutal left-right, and 
Stenn sagged. Carefully Arena 
aimed a right cross to the jaw. 
Stenn dropped. 

Arena wiped an arm across his 
face. 

“The little man tried, Mister. 
Let’s give him that.” 

He walked past my chair, 
stooped for Stenn’s gun. I heaved, 
slammed against him, and the 
light chair collapsed as we went 
over. Arena landed a kick, then I 
was on my feet, shaking a slat 
loose from the dangling wire. 
Arena stepped in, threw a whist- 
ling right. I ducked it, landed a 
hard punch to the midriff, another 
on the jaw. Arena backed, bent 
over but still strong. I couldn’t 
let him rest. I was after him, took 
two in the face, ducked a hay- 
maker that left him wide open 
just long enough for me to put 
everything I had in an uppercut 
that sent him back across his 
fancy desk. He sprawled, then slid 
onto the floor. 



116 



GALAXY 



I went to him, kicked him 
lightly in the ribs. 

“Where’s Williams,” I said. I 
kept kicking and asking. After 
five tries, Arena shook his head 
and tried to sit up. I put a foot 
in his face and he relaxed. I asked 
him again. 

“You didn’t learn this kind of 
tactics at the Academy,” Arena 
whined. 

“It’s the times,” I said. “They 
have a coarsening effect.” 

“Williams was a fancy-pants,” 
Arena said. “No guts. He pulled 
the stopper.” 

“Talk plainer,” I said, and 
kicked him again, hard — but I 
knew what he meant. 

“Blew his lousy head off,” 
Arena yelled. “I gassed him and 
tried scop on him. He blew. He 
was out cold, and he blew.” 
“Yeah,” I said. “Hypnotics will 
trigger it.” 

“Fancy goddam wiring job,” 
Arena muttered, wiping blood 
from his face. 

T got the wire and trussed Arena 
up. I had to clip him twice be- 
fore I finished. I went through his 
pockets, looked at things, recov- 
ered my souvenirs. I went over to 
Stenn. He was breathing. 

Arena was watching. “He’s 
okay, for crissake,” he said. “What 
kind of punch you think I got?” 
I hoisted Stenn onto my 
shoulder. 

THE KING OF THE CITY 





“So long, Arena,” I said. “I don’t 
know why I don’t blow your 
brains out. Maybe it’s that Navy 
Cross citation in your wallet.” 

“Listen,” Arena said. “Take me 
with you.” 

“A swell idea,” I said. “I’ll pick 
up a couple of tarantulas, too.” 

“You’re trying for the hack, 
right?” 

“Sure. What else?” 

“The roof,” he said. “I got six, 
eight rotos on the roof. One high- 
speed job. You’ll never make the 
hack.” 

“Why tell me?” 

“I got eight hundred gun boys 
in this building alone. They know 
you’re here. The hack is watched, 
the whole route. You can’t get 
through.” 

“What do you care?” 

“If the boys bust in here after 
a while and find me like this . 
They’ll bury me with the wires 
still on, Maclamore.” 

“How do I get to the roof?” 

He told me. I went to the right 
corner, pushed the right spot, and 
a panel slid aside. I looked back 
at Arena. 

“I’ll make a good sailor, Macla- 
more,” he said. 

“Don’t crawl, Arena,” I said. I 
went up the short stair, came out 
onto a block-square pad. 

Arena was right about the 
rotos. Eight of them. I picked 
the four-place Cad, and got Stenn 
tied in. He was coming to, mut-

he thought.

out . .” 

“Take it easy, Stenn,” I said. 
“Nothing can touch this bus. 
Where’s the boat?” I shook him. 
“Where’s the boat, Stenn?” 

He came around long enough 
to tell me. It wasn’t far — less 
than an hour’s run. 

“Stand by, Admiral,” I said. 
“I’ll be right back.” 

“Where . you . 

“We need every good man we 
can get,” I said. “And I think I 
know a guy that wants to join the 
Navy.” 



EPILOGUE 

A DMIRAL Stenn turned away 
from the communicator screen. 
“I think we’d be justified in 
announcing victory now, Commo- 
dore.” As usual, he sounded like a 
professor of diction, but he was 
wearing a big grin. 

“Whatever you say, chief,” I 
said, with an even sappier smile. 

I made the official announce- 
ment that a provisional Congress 
had accepted the resignations of 
all claims by former office hold- 
ers, and that new elections would 
be underway in a week.

I switched over to Power Sec- 
tion. The NCO in charge threw 
me a snappy highball. Damned if 
he wasn’t grinning too. 

“I guess we showed ’em who’s 
got the muscle, Commodore,” he 
said. 

“Your firepower demonstration 
was potent, Max,” I said. “You 
must have stayed up nights study- 
ing the tapes.” 

“We’ve hardly scratched the 
surface yet,” he said. 

“I’ll be crossing back to Alaska 
now, Mac,” Stenn said. 

I watched him move across the 
half-mile void to the flagship. 
Five minutes later the patrol de- 
tail broke away to take up sur- 
veillance orbits. They would be 
getting all the shore leave for 
the next few years, but I was glad 
my squadron had been detailed 
to go with the flagship on the 
Deep Space patrol. I wanted to 
be there when we followed those 
star surveys back to where their 
makers came from. Stenn wasn’t 
the man to waste time, either. 
He’d be getting under way any 
minute. It was time to give my 
orders. I flipped the communi- 
cator key to the squadron link-up. 

“Escort Commander to Escort,” 

I said. “Now hear this . .”

| T was later than Daniel 
Shawn had thought when 
JL they finally came out of the 
little farmhouse and headed for 
the big car of Tommy Rogers. It 
was almost sundown. And there 
had been a light rain. 

He took a slow breath, almost 
tasting the vigor of the air. 

Strange that it should be late, 
though. Time had seemed to go 
so slowly. The whole visit of 
Professor Rogers had been a mis- 
take that was hard on both of 
them. Now it was ending clum- 
sily, as it had begun and continued 



in awkwardness. Once Tommy 
had been his friend. But that was 
before Tommy went into Admin- 
istration and Shawn had given it 
all up to come back here to the 
little Minnesota farm where he 
had been born. 

“A rainbow!” Tommy ex- 
claimed suddenly. “I haven’t seen 
one in years.” 

“Nor missed it, I’ll warrant,” 
Shawn guessed, raising his eyes 
to see it. It lay in the gap between 
the locust trees, adding a jeweled 
light to their dark greenness. 

Tommy laughed his adminis-

trator’s unoffended laugh and 
glanced back over the little farm- 
yard before climbing into the car. 
“What do you find here, Dan? 
Kerosene lamps, outdoor plumb- 
ing, not even a radio. I still say 
it’s no place for you — when you 
could take over the Chair of His- 
tory if you’d be sensible.” 

“I was born here,” Shawn re- 
plied, evading the part of the 
question he didn’t want to an- 
swer. 

“But that was forty-five years 
ago!” 

Shawn nodded. “Yes. And 
sometimes, I think, so was the 
reality of myself. Let it be, 
Tommy, and I’ll ride into Utica 
with you.” 

Tommy couldn’t let it go, of 
course. There was that in the 
man which hated any way of life 
he could not understand. Maybe 
that was why he’d once studied 
sociology, only to find that the 
science could never supply 
enough answers. He repeated his 
question as the motor started. 

“I don’t know,” Shawn an- 
swered slowly, fumbling for his 
pipe as he tried again to answer 
it to himself. “Something I almost 
saw as a child and then lost. 
Maybe all of us lost it once. 
That’s why I turned to history, 
to find where it went. But I never 
found it. You used to do a lot 
of reading once, Tommy. You tell 
me. What was in Spencer, in 



Coleridge a little, in Orlando — 
only like an ‘echo, but now it’s 
gone from all our writing. 

“I never thought there was 
anything like that,” Tommy said 
flatly. 

Shawn sighed. He should have 
known the answer that was a part 
of the man. Then they reached 
the little village, no more than 
a mile from the farm. He got 
out, putting out a hand. 

B UT Tommy wasn’t ready to 
end it yet. “If you’re going 
to eat here, I’ll join you,” he 
suggested. 

Shawn shrugged, then nodded. 
He was sorry that he had given 
in to the man’s importunings 
over the phone and let him make 
the useless drive from Chicago. 
There should have been an end 
to it now. Yet Shawn had in- 
tended to dine here, since his 
own cooking was no better than it 
should be. 

He picked up tobacco and the 
paper at a little store before lead- 
ing the other to the restaurant 
beside the gas station. They or- 
dered and waited for the food, 
with nothing to say between 
them. 

The paper, Shawn saw from 
the headlines, had been another 
mistake, but he glanced at it 
while consuming the tasteless 
food. There was a dark ugliness 
to the news. As there always was. 

GALAXY 



The lilt of life was lacking in 
every part of it. It was heavy and 
ponderous, even when it tried to 
be witty. And around him, the 
few diners were filled with a 
heaviness that made their 
laughter a deliberate effort and 
gave them no pleasure in the 
stories they told endlessly to each 
other. 

“Why?” Shawn asked ab- 
ruptly, pointing to the headlines. 
“You’re still a sociologist, 
Tommy. Tell me, why all the 
dark ugliness?” 

For a moment, it seemed that 
there was a measure of under- 
standing in the man. He sighed. 
“Sociologists don’t know much 
more about the present cultural 
matrix than anyone else, Dan. 
Too much technology, maybe, 
before the culture can absorb it. 
Or maybe this is just one of the 
plateaus in an evolution tQward 
a sense of group maturity.” 
“Maturity?” Shawn questioned 
bitterly. 

“It could be.” And now the 
administrator’s optimism was 
creeping back into the face. “Oh, 
I know, there’s still hate and ugly 
conflict.' But think of the earlier 
ages, Dan. Look at the supersti- 
tious panics, the persecutions, 
the witch-burnings. There was a 
time when anything different 
from what was considered human 
was to be killed on sight. Chil-

proved a lot in that respect — at 
least in this country. We’re trying 
to understand other peoples. Why 
right now, Dan, if little green men 
got out of a saucer, most people 
would be delighted to meet them. 
Lots of men are hoping to find 
alien races — look at Project 
Ozma. Or look at the case of 
that priest who is writing about 
the question of redemption for 
non-human beings. If there were 
werewolves today, I’ll bet that 
there’d be a lot more scientific 
interest in them than fear or 
hatred. There wouldn’t even be 
any persecution of witches, un- 
less they went in for criminal 
activity. That could be consid- 
ered a form of maturity.” 

Or maybe the human race was 
so unconsciously sick of its own 
sordidness that it would welcome 
even alien relief, Shawn thought. 

But he let the conversation die. 
There was as little answer to the 
problem in sociology as in history 
— as he had known all along. 

He went out with Tommy at 
last, putting out his hand awk- 
wardly in silence as the other 
reached his car. 

“You sure you won’t come 
back, Dan?” Tommy asked for 
the last time. “You’re definitely 
turning President Schuyler 
down?” 

“I won’t come back, Tommy.”

He stepped back from the car 
and stood watching it drive away. 
Then he sighed and dismissed 
the whole unfortunate business 
from his mind. 

¥ T was already so far into dusk 

that the stars were shining as 
he turned to walk homeward. 
The Moon was full and start- 
lingly white in the dark sky. 
Wisps of clouds fleeced its path. 
The night was going to be one 
of loveliness. For a moment he 
was glad he had ridden in, since 
it gave him an excuse to travel 
back through the beauty of it. 

The road went across the rail- 
road tracks that led to all the 
earth, and yet the rails seemed 
to lead nowhere in the moon- 
light. It carried him on, past the 
school where once a teacher had 
touched his mind, then past , the 
old cemetery, shaded with hol- 
lows of darkness. For a moment, 
there was a touch of the spiritual 
hush he had felt long before as 
he moved by the quiet place. 
Then it was shattered by a coarse 
laugh, and a burst of smut-tinged 
words of a juke song on a tran- 
sistor radio. 

Superstition was dying, as 
Tommy had said. At least, the 
older superstitious fear of things 
in the night. But the darkness of 
it was being replaced by an even 
darker veil of sordid ugliness. 

Even the dead had no peace. 



A couple had found the retreat 
for their own use, but without 
even the respect of silence. And 
maybe these dead could never 
feel the lack, if they could know. 
Yet he felt his soul rubbed in 
dirt as he guessed the ages of the 
couple. They were using the time 
for what should have been an 
opening outward in them for 
things better reserved for later 
years. 

The houses thinned out and 
were behind him, except for a 
single light back from the road 
half a mile ahead. Here the land 
dipped down, carrying the road 
with it. It had been a graveled 
road once. Shawn missed the 
sound of the pebbles. But the 
Moon was the same he had 
known long ago, its light like a 
kiss across the fields. Even crops 
cultivated by great machines 
instead of horses could take on 
a difference in the silvering from 
above. 

Where had men lost whatever 
they had lost? History had taught 
him nothing, though he had 
searched. And the keys in litera- 
ture were too elaborately carved 
to fit the lock. Books were written 
to bury the feelings of a past gen- 
eration, not to reveal what might 
be happening in the present. 

There had been a magic in 
men once. Oh, to be .sure, it had 
been rare enough, and whole areas 
has missed it. Rome had been 



122 



GALAXY 



mighty in valor without it. Much 
of Greece had lost it, though it 
lay somewhere in the soft hint 
of legends older than Olympus. 
But there had been Persia. There 
had been Queen Maev and the 
Isle of Avalon, the sea warriors 
of Ys and the dreams that misted 
across man s rise from a beast. 
No time had ever been without 
it before. 

VET this time was lacking 
A whatever it was. Save for a 
few bits borrowed from the past 
in Yeats, there was no song or 
dream in the poetry now; and 
nobody even read poetry to look 
for such things. The art was as 
ugly and machine-symboled as 
the thoughts of the little minds 
that made it. 

The music was noise and the 
only legend was the legend of 
power. 

A car filled with teen-agers 
passed him. The top was down, 
but none of them were seeing the 
moonlight. 

Shawn passed the sandstone 
ridge at the edge of his farm, 
lifted a wire gate and left the 
road. The woods still stretched 
along the road. They were his 
woods, as they had been once 
when he was a boy. There, along 
the little rutted trail through 
them, was the hazel bush, or one 
like the one he remembered. The 
wild grapes were ripe and sweet, 



beaded with the rain or dew. He 
tasted them and went medita- 
tively on. 

There had been a lilting in a 
few men’s thoughts once — 
enough to lighten the others, and 
to echo still, faintly, out of the 
filter of older literature and 
legendry. It had gone. Maybe the 
industrial revolution? But that 
was a poor answer, since the 
revolution had touched only 
lightly on much of the world, yet 
the wonder had vanished just as 
quickly. Maybe the drive toward 
power? And yet, there had been 
power before without the death 
of the glamyr he could sense 
without defining. 

Something had gone out of 
men. In its place was only the 
body of man’s work — the ma- 
chines, the dark forces that drove 
him on to bombs and destiny, the 
rockets that could lift him to- 
ward outer space but hide the 
dancing of the stars. Hundreds 
of years before, the lilt — and 
there was no other word — had 
vanished. 

History had failed to show a 
reason why. 

Shawn had come back here, 
looking for the threads he had 
lost in childhood. He was still 
seeking them. He walked on 
through the stubble left from the 
harvested barley . and some- 
thing seemed to whisper in his 
veins.

T HERE was the feeling in him 
that he should go on. He 
went, past the sagging barn and 
down the lane toward the or- 
chard. The pump at the old well 
creaked and gave forth water 
that was reddened with rust, but 
cold and tingling on his palate. 
He stopped to pluck an apple 
from an unpruned tree and 
munched on it. 

And now the tingling was 
stronger, and there was a faint 
singing of the blood in his ears, 
as if a horn were being blown 
somewhere. It became louder as 
he crossed a stile into the 
meadow. 

The grass was faintly damp. 
There was the smell of clover in 
the air, over the faint, rich musk 
of the earth itself. He moved 
across it, listening to the bending 
of the grass and the soft scuttling 
sounds of the little creatures that 
lived in it. From a pond beyond 
the orchard lane, the croaking of 
frogs reached him, the eerie call 
of a screech owl, the chirping of 
crickets. 

The bugling of the strange ex- 
citement in his mind was stronger 
now. 

He headed for the little dip 
near the center of the meadow. 
As a boy, he had lain there in 
the sunlight out of the wind and 
read Princess of Mars and Hag- 
gard and Dunsany, or crouched 
in the moonlight at times when 



he was too restless to sleep and 
too filled with unremembered 
plans. It was too damp now for 
a man of forty-five to return to 
the earth, but the spot drew him. 

And then he saw the thing, 
centered in the spot toward 
which he was headed, and his 
heart seemed to leap with shock 
and then with expectancy. 

He moved to it slowly. 

He tried to tell himself it was 
something left behind by some 
wooing couple or as a practical 
joke by his neighbors. But he 
knew better. 

It looked like a shell made of 
something milky-white. Half was 
almost buried in the grass. The 
other half of the opened shell 
was resting backwards against a 
rock. It seemed to be lined with 
a softness like the packed down 
of a milkweed pod. And it was 
perhaps eight feet long. 

But it was the sweep of the 
lines and the rightness of the 
form that held his eyes. There 
was a fluting of the milky sub- 
stance that lifted something in 
him as he had felt it lift before 
at an ancient jade screen or a 
phrase of Mozart. 

There was no mark to show 
how it had come there. It must 
have been after the rain, since 
the lining was dry and soft to 
his touch. 

Inevitably, he thought of flying 
saucers. But he threw the idea 

GALAXY 



out of his mind, like a man brush- 
ing dirt from himself. The ugli- 
ness of the times was reflected 
in the pitiful situation where 
men’s dreaming of better things 
led only to the banality of the 
cults. And of all the cults, the 
flying saucer ones were the least 
alive with a spark of the — lilt. 

Yet he knew without question- 
ing that this thing had never been 
shaped on Earth. 

And as if to confirm his idea, 
his eyes caught sight of a design 
that was revealed softly in the 
moonlight against the lid of the 
shell. He bent to see it, but it 
was still too dim. 

Finally, as he had known he 
was going to do, he kicked off 
his wet shoes and stepped into 
the hollow of the padding, letting 
himself down gently until his 
eyes were near the carving. 

Tl/fOONLIGHT shone gently 
through the lid, making it 
hard to be sure of details. But 
somehow, his eyes filled with the 
figure. It was a woman — or 
rather, not a woman, since the 
features were planed as no hu- 
man face could be. A strange 
woman, thinner than any human 
and more supple, from the dance 
in which she was frozen. The fi- 
nal proof of lack of humanity lay 
in the hair that rippled from her 
head and grew into a double 
crest on her back, spreading out- 
! i 

RETURN ENGAGEMENT 



wards across each of her shoul- 
ders, but standing well above her 
skin. 

And suddenly, her hand 
seemed to move! 

Shawn blinked. But it had 
been no illusion. The carved 
fingers opened and the arm 
moved toward him, just as the 
lid began to move inward to close 
the shell. There was a dancing 
cloud of motes that sprang from 
her hand and sped toward him. 
He lifted his arms, but it was 
too late. The gleaming motes 
struck his eyes, and they dosed. 

Gentle waves of sleep washed 
across his brain. He had only 
time to feel the shell lift some- 
how and ride upwards into the 
moonlight before the sleep 
claimed him completely. 

There was a sense of the pas- 
sage of time, eventually. His eyes 
would not open, but he lay some- 
where that was not on Earth, and 
he could sense that hours had 
passed. Hours, he thought. Not 
days or weeks, but only hours. 

Around him, there was a stir- 
ring. He could sense that the 
shell was gone, and there was an 
alien but earthy odor in his nos- 
trils. Now sounds came — voices 
— but no voices he had ever 
heard. There was a silvery qual- 
ity to them, like the voices of 
children mysteriously robbed of 
the harsh overtones of chilldish 
screams. These were almost 



124 



125 



liquid. Yet he could sense a 
frenzy and worry in them. In the 
background, there was a chant- 
ing, and the heart inside him 
seemed to be crying at is ended. 

He tried to sit up and open 
his eyes, but his mind was still 
not in control of his body. Some 
sign must have shown, however. 
There was a gentle touch on his 
forehead, and a few words ob- 
viously meant to be soothing. 
The words held a hint of famil- 
iarity, but he could understand 
none of them. 

“Where am I?” he asked. 

There was a sigh near him, 
and another voice answered. It 
was a strong, masculine voice 
with a power of command and 
responsibility behind it, even 
though there were no really deep 
tones. “You would call it Mars,” 
the words came in oddly ac- 
cented English. 

“Mars? In a few hours?” Yet 
as Shawn protested, he sensed 
the rightness of the answer. The 
weight of him was little more 
than a third that which he had 
always known. 

The voice was sober and some- 
how withdrawn. “Our ways are 
not your ways, man. Our science 
means as little to you as yours 
to us. We accept the way of the 
universe where you bend the 
laws of nature against them- 
selves. Who shall say which is 
better? Yet for this one thing of 



moving beyond the distances 
you know, we have ways you 
have not.” 

“Yet you speak English.” 

“There have been others be- 
fore you. Not many.” The voice 
was falling, like the ending of an 
organ note. “So few. And 
now ...” It died away, and then 
resumed more normally. “But 
enough. We go to confer. Use the 
time until we return as you will.” 

There were rustlings again, 
and then light shone weakly 
through Shawn’s lids. Something 
touched his face, and he found 
his eyes opening. This time when 
he tried to sit up, his body 
obeyed, though the motion was 
awkward in the unfamiliar pull 
of the planet. 

A DREAM, he told himself. A 
fantasy. He’d wake in the 
morning wet and soaked in the 
meadow, sneezing with a cold 
from exposure. 

But he knew better. A dream 
like this could be none of his 
making. There were elements in 
it, as he stared about, that could 
never have come from his mind. 

There wasn’t much to see. He 
was in a room that must have 
been carved from colored rock, 
and there was a sense of a great 
many feet of similar rock above 
him. The light seemed to be in the 
air itself, diffused and softly 
silver over everything. He lay on 



126 



GALAXY 



what must be a couch, but a 
couch with soft curves an dorna- 
ments no man could have plan- 
ned. And beyond him was a 
fountain. 

It was a tiny fountain, carved 
out of the wall of rock, with a 
thin spray of water falling over 
into a basin, making a soft 
tinkling sound. In front of the 
basin was the carving of a kneel- 
ing girl. This time there was only 
a hint of the shoulder crests of 
hair, but the green of the stone 
made the other features easier 
to see. No human artist could 
have fashioned that, and no hu- 
man model could have posed for 
it. The girl was beautiful, but it 
was as if she came from a race 
that had descended from some- 
thing related to the lighter mon- 
keys, as man claimed descent 
from a great anthropoid ancestor 
of himself and the gorilla. 

Then, without warning, a cur- 
tain seemed to fall across the 
room. It cut off most of it, leav- 
ing him with only a little space 
before the couch. But if the 
blackness was of cloth, it fell 
without a rustle. And behind it 
was the stirring of others moving 
into the room and finding places. 

Behind the screen, the voice 
he took to be that of a leader 
began again. “What are you 
called, man? I am Porreos, a 
prince of my people.” 

“Danny,” Shawn answered. 



His own response surprised him. 
He’d not called himself that since 
his childhood. But he let it stand. 

“Then, Danny, we have con- 
ferred^ And we feel you are bet- 
ter for not seeing us, since you 
cannot remain with us. We are 
sorry to have brought you here, 
though it is too late to alter that. 
But you will be returned.” 

Shawn puzzled over it, finding 
no logic to the decision. Why 
couldn’t he remain? Why pick 
him up and bring him over 
all the distance for nothing but 
this? And why had the shell been 
on Earth in the first place? 

He did not think he had spoken 
aloud, but Porreos sighed and 
began to answer. “We had hoped 
for a child of your race, Danny. 
One who could learn to live with 
us, as you could never do here. 
And the call of the shell was set 
for the yearning of one of your 
children. Strange that you should 
have answered. As strange as the 
shells that have returned to us 
empty. It has been so long . .” 

A GAIN it was the fading of an 
organ note. And behind it 
came the hint of a wailing song 
in many voices, a snatch of group 
response that cut into Shawn’s 
nerves and brought tears to his 
eyes, though he could understand 
none of it. There was a delicacy 
here, a lack of strength and force, 
that hardly matched a race able 



RETURN ENGAGEMENT 



127 



to span space at the breathtaking 
speed of the shells. 

The air around him was al- 
most as thick as that of Earth, 
and there had been a fountain of 
water. It fitted no picture of 
Mars, as these voices fitted no 
people he had expected to find 
on the harshness of the little 
world. Suspicion grew in his mind 
suddenly. 

“You never camd from this 
planet, Porreos!” 

This time, the wailing chant 
began before the prince could 
answer. It was a thing of beauty 
and tradition, but the ache in it 
was like the ache of a man who 
would reach for the stars to melt 
them against the palm of his 
hand, and then look to find them 
gone. There was a laughter to it 
like the laughter that there would 
be because of the aching he felt 
too strong inside his breast for 
anything else. 

Shawn learned more from the 
song behind the words than from 
the answer that Porreos made. 
No, they had never developed on 
Mars, but far away. They had 
been an old race ten million 
years before. But on their world 
there had been another race, 
stronger, younger, with all that 
they lacked. And for a time, the 
two had touched falferingly, to 
the benefit of both. But then had 
come a great change over the 
younger race. 



Something that the old ones 
could not understand had taken 
over the whole emotions of the 
new ones. It had built a sudden 
hatred. 

The race that had sometimes 
feared and sometimes loved the 
race of Porreos was deliberately 
filled with superstition and belief 
that all other creatures were 
things of ultimate evil, to be 
shunned, hated and mistreated. 
And the old race had been unable 
to withstand it. They had never 
been strong. They had dwelt on 
only a part of the home planet 
at any time. But now, finally, 
they were forced to flee. 

Mars was the best they could 
find. 

They had carved dwellings out 
under the surface and trapped 
what little air and water there 
was. It was a poor home to them, 
but all they had. 

And now they were dying, 
slowly and gently. They each 
lived for a long time, but they 
bred infrequently to make up for 
it. And there was no longer the 
heart in them to keep up their 
numbers. All of the race that was 
left were here, behind the curtain. 

“All,” Porreos repeated as the 
song came to its end like the 
sound of the last leaf falling in 
the forest of winter. “It is a re- 
spect we owe you, at least, for 
disturbing you.” 

“But you’ll disturb children, 



128 



GALAXY 



porreos? You don’t mind steal- 
ing them and bring them here?” 

“Don’t condemn us without 
understanding,” the voice said, 
and there was dignity and hurt 
in it. “We’re a lonely people. We 
need others, and even a single 
child whom we can adopt and 
make into one of us helps. And 
besides, there’s another need 
which doesn’t concern you.” 

And there, Shawn realized, 
must lie the real crux of the 
matter. There was some need. 
There had to be, to send the 
shells across space looking for 
someone from Earth. “Maybe it 
does,” he decided slowly. 
“You’ve brought me here. The 
reason should concern me as 
much.* as it would concern a 
child.” 

“No!” 

^HAWN waited patiently, as an 
^ adult might put pressure on 
a balky child. He heard the same 
pressure mount behind the 
screen, with a rising tempo of 
rustlings and subdued whispers 
in the tantalizingly familiar alien 
tongue. 

“Don’t ask us that, Danny!” 
It was almost a roar of pain from 
the prince. “A child we can 
adopt and make one of us and 
be bound to. But it is not for you 
to ask! We’re an old, proud 
people, and our traditions are 
stronger than the laws of nature 



you Earthlings fight. We cannot 
ask favors outside our own. We 
cannot beg — not even for a part 
of the world that was our own. 
And we shall not beg of you!” 
It was a nightmare experience. 
Logic was in abeyance, as if 
some part of him had already 
recognized that normal logic 
could not be used. But it was no 
more a nightmare than his own 
culture had become to him in the 
last few years. Beside that ugli- 
ness, this unreason was almost 
childishly simple. 

“You’re not begging,” he told 
the group behind the curtain. 
“I’m giving. Tell me what you 
want of me and take it.” 

There was a shock of silence, 
and a whisper that was not in 
the voice of the prince. “You 
trust us that rrfuch?” 

To his own surprise, he did. 
Somewhere his mind was making 
a pattern out of all this, and he 
was not afraid of them. 

“As a free gift, then,” Porreos 
said at last, and some of the 
fatigue seemed to lift from the 
voice. “We have one who is dy- 
ing. And there is something in 
your blood which can save her 
— a resistance that our bodies 
lack. We need a few drops of 
your blood, Danny.” 

Shawn got up quietly from the 
couch and approached the cur- 
tain. He thrust out his bared 
arm experimentally, surprised 



RETURN ENGAGEMENT 



129 



when it penetrated with almost 
no resistance. He grinned at him- 
self as he waited. 

There was the tiniest of prick- 
ings on his finger, and a brief 
itch. When he withdrew his hand, 
something like a fine mesh of 
cobweb lay over the end of the 
finger. He was sure there would 
be no infection. 

There were stirrings but no 
voices behind the screen, and he 
waited, staring again around the 
limited section of the room he 
could see. It was beautiful. There 
was a shaping of beauty no man 
could have rendered. But there 
wss a weakness, a lack of the 
very brutal force he sensed in 
even the ugliness that was over- 
taking Earth . And there was 
no lilt here either. 

UHANNY,” Porreos called at 
last. “Danny, there is life 
among us in one who was dying. 
Your blood is our debt. Before 
we return you to Earth, there is 
another tradition which we must 
keep. Make one request of us, 
as is your right now. And if we 
can fulfill, it, the boon is yours.” 

It was what Shawn had ex- 
pected. It could be no other. And 
there was still a surprise. 

No, he thought, there could be 
no lilt here and none among his 
people. The dark force there and 
the fair lack of force here were 
neither complete. And the lilt he 



had named and sought could 
only come from a true comple. 
tion. No wonder the shell had 
come to him in answer to his 
yearning. No wonder that these 
people sought a child of Earth 
while his people lost their super- 
stitious xenophobia and even 
wanted alien contact from the 
stars. 

“Porreos,” he asked, “can you 
follow my thoughts?” 

“A little, Danny Shawn.” The 
voice was reluctant, as if the 
admission carried unknown dan- 
gers. Then it was suddenly filled 
with intensity. “Yes, oh yes, We 
can follow!” 

The curtain vanished, leaving 
the room visible to Shawn, and 
he could see all of the ancient 
race that was left before him. 
There were less than a hundred 
there, green-clad and brown- 
garbed men, and women with 
delicate winglike mantles of hair. 
Their faces were inhuman and 
their tiny bodies were strange. 
But they were familiar as no 
alien being could ever be. 

“Ask your boon,” the prince 
of the fairy folk cried. But they 
already knew, and there was 
laughter rising and smiles spread- 
ing across the elfin faces that 
looked up toward the human. 

“Come home,” Shawn asked 
them. “Come back to Earth. We 
need you!”

THE MAN I DIDN'T MEET 

I DON’T know whether the 
Reader’s Digest is still run- 
ning the series of articles 
called “The Most Fascinating 
Man I Ever Met;” at any event, 
some time ago I was asked by 
somebody whether I had ever 
contributed to that series. My 
answer was “no” — which inevi- 
tably led to the question: “well, 
who is the most fascinating man 
you met?” 

I have about half a dozen can- 
didates in mind, but I can’t an-

swer this question. Partly because 
I would have trouble making up 
my mind which one of this half 
dozen people deserves the crown; 
partly because most of them are 
still alive and I don’t know how 
they will develop. More impor- 
tant, to me at least, I am still 
alive — which means that I’ll 
probably meet a few more fas- 
cinating people. 

Since I cannot write about the 
most fascinating man I met I’ll 
write, instead, about a (presum- 
ably) fascinating man I almost 
met. I was in High School then. 
I must have been about 17 years 
old. My teacher of French, Dr. 
Sepp Schneider, was a ski enthu- 
siast . which has some bearing 
on the story. He had helped to 
make a feature-length movie 
about skiing and needed some 
help in distributing literature to 
the audience of a first private 
screening. I was drafted. To en- 
hance my enthusiasm for this job 
he told me that he had invited 
Dr. Theodor Zell to be in the au- 
dience and that he would in- 
troduce me to Dr. Zell after the 
screening. 

That was enough for me. I had 
been reading Dr. Zell’s books for 
some six years and had bought all 
of them that were still in print. 
(Fortunately for my pocketbook 
most of them were what we now 
call paperbacks.) 

Dr. Schneider had known Dr. 



Zell for many years. He told me 
what was then still a secret, 
namely that the well known 
name, “Dr. Theodor Zell,” was a 
pen name. His real name was Dr. 
Leopold Bauke. 

Germans are, as a rule, bitterly 
opposed to name changes since 
this implies a wilful break with 
family traditions. Dr. Bauke had. 
made an exception. It so happens 
that his real name is the idiomatic 
German word (somewhat mis- 
pronounced, which produces a 
humorous effect) for the bass 
drum of an Infantry band. Such a 
name would not do on the cover 
of a zoological book. Therefore 
Bauke had changed it (for liter- 
ary purposes only) to Zell. This 
corresponded, or at least hinted 
at, the zoological content, since 
the German word Zelle means 
“cell” in the biological sense. It 
does mean a cell in jail, too; but 
it was most unlikely that anybody 
would take that meaning for a 
pseudonym. 

Well, Dr. Zell did not come to 
the movie preview. His friend Dr. 
Schneider promised me that he 
would make another appoint- 
ment. It was scheduled several 
months later and then cancelled. 
Schneider remarked, “Theodor 
seems to be quite sick.” He was. 
Half a year later I read about 
his death. 

So I never actually did meet 
Dr. Zell.

VL7HO was he? 

™ The external circumstances 
of his life can be told in one 
paragraph, and even that para- 
graph is just for completeness’ 
sake. He was born in 1862 on an 
estate some three score miles 
from Berlin. He studied law, 
presumably at his father’s re- 
quest, and finally received the 
title Doktor beider Rechte, or 
“doctor of both laws” — mean- 
ing Roman and Code Napoleon. 
Then he settled in Berlin and 
started writing about animals. 

Within five years he was fa- 
mous. Of course, a few people 
attacked his views; but ten times 
as many defended them. Only a 
very few people knew him per- 
sonally, though some of his books 
sold more than 100,000 copies. 
In 1924 he quietly died. His 
obituary did not even mention 
the cause of death. 

There exists a joke about a 
man who, for the first time in 
his life, attends a theatrical per- 
formance, which happens to be 
Hamlet. On his way out he is 
heard to mutter: “All that fellow 
Shakespeare did was string a lot 
of quotations together.” Some- 
thing similar may be said about 
Dr. Zell’s work. Many of the ideas 
are now simply taken for granted 
that even people old enough to 
know about Dr. Zell do not know 
that it was he who said so first. 
And the younger generation of 



zoologists doesn’t even know his 
name. 

In writing about Dr. Zell it is 
therefore not very important who 
he was. What counts is what he 
said. His specialty was to explain 
actions of animals which seem 
mysterious or senseless to the 
casual observer. Interestingly 
enough, he never ran an animal 
experiment in the modern sense. 
He only observed. 

Some of his work dealt with 
stories current in his time. One 
of them, which I heard myself as 
a boy from a forester, dealt with 
the mixed offspring of wolves and 
domesticated dogs. That they do 
interbreed is a fact well known to 
every outdoorsman in the areas 
where wolves occur. The story 
was that puppies resulting from 
such a mixed marriage could be 
domesticated, but that pure wolf 
puppies could not. But if you 
found puppies in the forest, how 
could you tell whether they were 
dog, mixed or wolf? 

Very simple, said the people of 
what is now Poland and the 
western fringe of Soviet Russia. 
You pen them up for a few hours. 
Then, when they are likely to 
be thirsty, you give them water. 
If they lap it up with their 
tongues like domestic dogs they 
are dogs or mixed and can be 
kept. But if they drink like sheep, 
they are wolves and must be 
killed.

Nobody ever doubted that 
story; everybody had learned it 
early in life from his father. 
Except Dr. Zell. He had grown 
up with lots of dogs and had 
seen wolves. There was no dif- 
ference in the build of the mouth; 
why should there be one in drink- 
ing habits? “It took one trip to 
the zoo,” he wrote, “but then it 
took five hours of patience.” After 
that time all three species of 
wolves had performed for him, all 
of them lapping the water like his 
own dogs. 

Another problem was the one 
of bow carrion-eating birds find 
their food. The customary an- 
swer was that these birds have a 
fantastically keen sense of smell, 
so keen that they not only smell a 
dead body miles away but that 
they can even smell it if a person 
or an animal is going to die soon. 
We now know that this is non- 
sense. Birds (with the possible 
exception of the New Zealand 
kiwi) don’t have any sense of 
smell at all. True, the bill of 
most birds still shows holes where 
nostrils normally belong, but 
there is nothing behind it to do 
the actual smelling. 

About sjxty years ago a natu- 
ralist began to grow doubtful. He 
expressed his thoughts in the fol- 
lowing manner: “The eye oper- 
ates by means of light rays; the 
nose needs particles of the smel- 
ling substance to work on. A bird 



circling, say, five hundred yards 
up is likely to be above the limit 
to which such particles will as- 
cend. Moreover, it is moving so 
fast that its nose would be handi- 
capped by its very speed. There- 
fore I believe that, in the case of 
birds, the sense of smell plays a 
very minor role in the process of 
locating food.” 

Dr. Zell went one step farther. 
With numerous examples he 
showed that in the case of birds 
the sense of smell plays no role 
at all. (This was before the ana- 
tomical impossibility of a bird 
smelling anything had been dem- 
onstrated.) When he declared 
categorically, “Birds go by sight 
only,” he had already postulated 
his main theory, namely the dis- 
tinction of animals into “eye- 
guided” and “nose-guided”. 

Just to avoid misunderstand- 
ings I have to point out that Dr. 
Zell (though he mentioned in- 
sects occasionally) was essen- 
tially concerned with mammals 
and birds. Since it turned out that 
all birds are exclusively “eye- 
guided,” the discussion of animal 
behavior dealt with mammals, 
especially with domesticated 
animals and game. 

He related at one time that the 
casual question of why some dogs 
bay at the moon started him 
thinking. Another thing that stuck 
in his mind was the rather un- 
flattering German saying, “So- 



134 



GALAXY 



and-so behaved just as stupid as 
a cow confronted with a new 
door to the stable.” The third 
example that provided a clue to 
him was a story told by a lady 
who owned an English bulldog. 
While the maid was taking the 
dog for a stroll, a new and very 
large mirror was installed in the 
lady’s boudoir. As the dog was 
brought in and saw his reflection 
in the big mirror he started to 
growl and evidently got ready 
for battle, approaching his reflec- 
tion stiff-legged, cautious and 
teeth ready, until he was about a 
yard from the mirror. Then he 
sniffed a few times and quietly 
settled down in his favorite 
corner on the carpet. 

The lady concluded that her 
pet quieted down as soon as he 
recognized himself in the mirror. 

That, Dr. Zell said, was not the 
reason — even though he did not 
doubt the facts as related. Dogs 
are the commonest example of a 
nose-guided animal. If dogs could 
talk (this is my statement, not 
Dr. Zell’s), they would not say, 
“Let me see,” they would say, 
“Let me smell.” To a dog things 
do not “look right,” they “smell 
right.” And just as we may look 
very carefully at something which 
is by no means a pretty sight, 
so a dog may carefully sniff some- 
thing which doesn’t smell nice at 
all. He needs a “smell identifica- 
tion” to make sense out of some- 



thing (or just to remember it) 
while we need a “picture identifi- 
cation” for the same reasons. 

Keeping in mind that the dog 
is “nose-guided,” the story of the 
bulldog and the large mirror ap- 
pears in a different light. On en- 
tering the boudoir the dog saw 
another dog and prepared him- 
self for a fight, just in case. As 
he came closer, the “other dog” 
came closer too. But when they 
were within jumping distance the 
bulldog could not smell the “other 
dog.” Hence there was no other 
dog — and he might as well take 
a nap. 

The cow that stands, seemingly 
the epitome of stupidity, in front 
of the new stable door is in a 
similar dilemma. Cows are “nose- 
guided” too. Now, all the way 
home all the smells are as they 
should be and where they should 
be. But just before entering the 
stable one expected smell (that 
of the old door) is missing and 
a new one, not at all resembling 
the old one (namely freshly cut 
wood and paint), is in its place. 
To a nose-guided animal this can 
only mean that there is something 
fundamentally wrong. To an eye- 
guided animal the difference 
would be minor; the door would 
have the right size and shape and 
approximately the same color as 
the old one. 

Oh, yes, the baying at the 
moon.

Well, there is something up 
there which can be seen. It isn’t 
there all the time, in which case 
one would probably learn to 
ignore it. But even when there it 
has no smell at all, which is dis- 
maying. 

As Dr. Zell phrased it: “Just try 
to imagine how we would feel if 
there was something in our room 
which we could smell and even 
feel, but could not see. It would 
be a rather upsetting experi- 
ence!” 

Since the nose is so important 
to the dog, their habit of leaving a 
“visiting card” at trees and fire- 
plugs becomes clear too. They 
smell not just that another dog 
has been there, but which other 
dog. If you watch your own dog’s 
behavior carefully you can almost 
guess it too, because one other 
dog is considered a friend, while 
another dog is the opposite. The 
point here is again that you have 
to see how your own dog behaves; 
your dog goes by his nose. Dr. 
Zell coined the term “the nose- 
guided animal’s post office” for 
these landmarks where a “notice” 
(in the form of a smell) is left. 

The American writer Ernest 
Thompson-Seton had arrived at 
the same conclusion, incidentally. 
He wrote that when the wolf 
Lobo stuck his nose into the air 
and sniffed for ten minutes it was 
to him as if you spend ten minutes 
with the morning newspaper. You 



learn what has been going on in 
your absence, or while you were 
asleep. 

Naturally Dr. Zell’s distinction 
into nose-guided and eye-guided 
was not supposed to mean that 
the animal in question goes by 
this one sense only. Except the 
birds; it is quite possible that the 
old naturalist guessed right when 
he pointed to the high speed of 
movement as the cause. We are 
ourselves eye-guided animals. 
But we sniff for a gas leak (this 
partly due to the fact that we 
know that gas cannot be seen), 
and when a piece of meat which 
has been overlooked in the refrig- 
erator for some time does not 
“look right” we make our nose a 
consultant. Likewise dogs do see, 
though apparently poorly (with 
the exception of some breeds like 
the greyhound), but to them sight 
is secondary. We trust our eyes. 
The dog trusts his nose. In pas- 
sing it may be remarked that this 
explains why an old blind dog 
does not seem to be particularly 
unhappy. He is in about the posi- 
tion of a man who has lost his 
sense of smell; it’s distressing on 
occasion, but no major catas- 
trophe. 

Mostly because some critics 
misconstrued “nose-guided” into 
“exclusively nose-guided” and 
other critics brought up the ques- 
tion “what about hearing?” Dr. 
Zell later phrased his guiding idea 



136 



GALAXY 



differently by saying that “among 
higher mammals the sum of the 
three major senses (sight, smell 
and hearing) is a constant.” It 
seems to me that the nose-guided 
animals place a little more reli- 
ance on their hearing than do the 
eye-guided animals. 

Well, that’s the story of the 
man I didn’t meet. Possibly he 
wouldn’t have been too interest- 
ing as a person. But his ideas were 

— and these we can still talk 
about. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

I have two questions. (1) Is it 
true that a ship which sinks where 
the ocean is very deep will never 
reach the bottom? (2) Some time 
ago I called a young porcupine a 
hedgehog. My neighbor laughed 
at me and said they were two 
different animals. Is this true? 
David E. Brown 
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 

“No” to the first, “yes” to the 
second. 

The idea that a sinking ship 
may not reach bottom in deep 
water is rather widely distributed, 
but there is no truth in it. Since 
water is a virtually incompres- 
sible liquid — as most liquids are 

— the density of the water at the 
bottom of the ocean is only very 
slightly greater than that of sur- 
face water. Hence a piece of 
sheet steel, such as a no longer 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



watertight ship, will sink all the 
way to the bottom no matter how 
deep the water. Of course, it is 
just possible that a damaged ship 
has a number of compartments 
which still hold air; such a ship 
may, for a while, behave like a 
submerged submarine, drifting a 
few dozen feet below the surface. 
Whether such a case has actually 
been observed is somethng I don’t 
know. But in time the air will 
escape from these compartments 
too, and then the ship will sink. 

As regards the porcupine and 
the hedgehog, they are two en- 
tirely different animals which 
have only two things in common: 
both are mammals and both are 
spiny. But the porcupine is a 
rodent, like rabbits, squirrels, rats, 
etc., while the hedgehog, which is 
somewhat smaller than a porcu- 
pine, belongs to the much older 
Insectivores (like moles and 
shrews). There are no hedgehogs 
in the United States except in 
zoological gardens. 

I am asking this question of 
you because you are the author 
of Dragons in Amber. I have a 
beautiful piece of amber jewelry 
and while showing it to a friend 
of mine remarked that the "stone'” 
is between 45 and 50 million 
years old. She admired the piece 
but remarked that, after all, every 
stone is millions of years old. I 
presume this is true, or is it? 



137 



Remember that we were speak- 
ing of jewelry, that is, of stones 
like a diamond, a ruby, an opal 
or a topaz, not just a piece of 
rock. 

(Mrs.) Rutka Perkainen 

Englewood, New Jersey 

Well, we could include odd 
“pieces of rock” in the discus- 
sion, too. In fact, it may be help- 
ful if we do so. A piece of chalk, 
having been formed during the 
Cretaceous Period, is obviously 
older than a piece of amber which 
was formed during the very early 
part of the Tertiary Period. And 
a piece of anthracite coal is older, 
too, having been formed during 
the Carboniferous Period, or 
roughly 300 million years ago. 
And some plain rock samples 
from Canada could be 800 mil- 
lion years old. 

As regards the age of an opal 
or a topaz, the answer is unfor- 
tunately that we do not know. 
Most gem stones are chemically 
rather simple substances. Ruby 
and sapphire, for example, are 
aluminum oxides, opal and ame- 
thyst are silicon oxides and so 
forth. What counts is that they 
are crystallized, and have just the 
proper kind (and amount) of im- 
purities for color, etc. We don’t 
know how long the process of for- 
mation takes in nature but, under 
the proper conditions, it might be 
less than the time a woman would 



be willing to wait for an especially 
beautiful stone. Since the process 
of formation must be rather short 
there is no way of judging how 
long ago it took place. A fine 
amethyst might have been formed 
five million years ago or only five 
thousand years ago. To determine 
the age of a particular gem is, at 
least at present, impossible. 

The diamond is a special case 
— mainly because, chemically 
speaking, it is the simplest of all 
gems, merely crystallized carbon. 
The first man to crystallize car- 
bon in the laboratory was the 
French chemist Henri Moissan, a 
little over sixty years ago. Mois- 
san suspected that carbon might 
not crystallize under ordinary 
pressures and thought of a way to 
produce high pressure suddenly. 
He dissolved carbon in liquid iron 
and then dumped the whole into 
cold water. The sudden contrac- 
tion of the molten iron produced 
the high pressures he wanted, and 
he did find minute diamonds in 
the iron afterwards. Evidently 
they had formed instantaneously. 

(General Electric is making 
diamonds, at present structurally 
poor and blackish in color, up to 
one carat in size, employing tem- 
peratures from 2200 to 4400 
degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 
between 800,000 and 1,800,000 
pounds per square inch. But they 
don’t say how long it takes — 
for obvious reasons.) 



138 



GALAXY 



If great heat and sudden high 
pressure is what makes a diamond 
it was suggested almost imme- 
diately after Moissan’s success 
that diamonds might be created 
by the impact of large meteorites. 
This suggestion has been revived 
recently. If this is correct the dia- 
mond would be formed in a frac- 
tion of a second. If a process 
similar to Moissan’s laboratory 
experiment is responsible for the 
origin of crystallized carbon the 
same would be true. In a display 
of various gem stones it is quite 
possible, therefore, that the big 
diamond which is the center of 
the display has the least chrono- 
logical age — if the most value 
— of all of them. 

After you and L. Sprague de 

i Camp have traced the wander- 
ings of Odysseus in your book 
Lands Beyond I am wondering 
whether a similar job could not 
be done for the deeds of Hercules, 
or Herakles? 

Sandra Rosen 
The Bronx, N. Y. 

In general the answer is “no”. 
In the Odyssey the technique of 
the poet — later imitated by 
whoever composed the tales of 
Sindbad the Sailor — is to lead 
the listener gradually from the 
known into the unknown. The 
audience at such a recital was, 



of course, rather mixed. Many 
were people who had never left 
their village. Others would have 
more knowledge because of asso- 
ciation and education. And some 
might be sailors who had been in 
distant places. These must not be 
given a chance to get up and say: 
“Nonsense! After you round that 
isle the black headland is in the 
direction of sunset, not in the 
direction of noon.” For this 
reason the geographical facts in 
the Odyssey are as accurate as 
they could be made — which in 
turn makes it possible to trace 
just what the poet had in mind. 

The tales around Herakles lack 
this desire for accuracy. True, the 
country ruled by Geryon is most 
likely what we now call Spain, 
but that is as far as it goes. 

However, for one of the deeds 
of Herakles one scholar has made 
an interesting suggestion. It is the 
killing of the Hydra. The Hydra, 
as you’ll recall, is the nine-headed 
serpent-like monster which devas- 
tated the countryside. Of its nine 
heads, one was immortal. When 
Herakles went to work on the 
monster, lopping off its heads, it 
grew two new ones for every one 
it lost. Finally a flaming torch 
was applied to the necks after a 
head had been chopped off and 
they would not grow again. But 
the immortal head could not be 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



139 




killed, so Herakles buried it under 
a huge rock. 

Just for your amusement I add 
here an artist’s attempt to picture 
the Hydra, it is from Konrad Ges- 
ner’s Historia Animalium, (1655.) 
Now the “explanation.” 

The name Hydra bears a most 
suspicious resemblance to the 
Greek word for “water,” namely _ 
hydor, and the Hydra therefore, 
was probably something liquid. 
And if you try to block a rivulet 
or creek it will probably flow 
around the obstacle in two rivu- 
lets, “growing two heads for the 
one lopped off.” 

But a wellspring of any kind 
would improve the landscape, 
not devastate it. Yes, said the 
scholar. If hydor meant “water” 
only, it certainly would. But in 



ancient times hydor probably was 
used for any liquid, and an oil 
well would devastate the purely 
rustic landscape. Hence the hydor 
stops flowing when a torch is 
applied to it. The immortal head 
is, of course, the oil well itself . 
but a huge rock might block it. 

It would be nice if we knew 
just what geographic locality is 
meant. We could then judge 
whether oil is likely there. 

I am the first to admit that this 
is a very ingenious explanation. 
Whether it is also correct is an 
entirely different question. 

1/2/3/4 . = 100. 

'T’HE problem published in the 
February issue was, as you 
probably remember, to use the 



figures from 1 to 9 in their natural 
order but, by interspersing plus 
and minus or other mathematical 
signs between the figures, to 
produce an equation balanced by 
the figure 100. 1 got the idea from 
the West German magazine Kos- 
mos which posed the same ques- 
tion, but did not require the 
figures natural sequence. 

To begin with the Kosmos 
published a number of solutions, 
of which seven complied with my 
stricter rule. They were: 



(1X2X3X4) + 5 + 6 + (7X8) + 9 = 100 (K.l) 

(1X2X3) +4+5+6+7+ (8X9) = 100 (K.2) 

123 + 4—5 + 67—89 = 100 (K.3) 

12 + 3 + 4-(56:7) + 89 = 100 (K.4) 

1X2X3— (4X5) + (6X7) + (8X9) = 100 (K.5) 

1 + (2X3) + (4X5)— 6 + 7 + (8X9) = 100 (K.6) 

1 + C(2X3X4X5):61 + 7 + (8X9) = 100 (K.7) 



most of which were also found by 
Galaxy readers. One amusing 
(and otherwise flattering) letter 
from Sally Markowitz in Brook- 
lyn provided the following: 



1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + (8X9) = 100 

with the statement that it couldn’t 
be correct because it was so easy. 

But the ones who really went 
to town were the team of Robert 
Salzman, John Bailey and Donald 
Maclachlan, all of Raytheon 
Company in Andover, Mass. 
These patient mathematicians 
found 16 solutions using only the 
basic operations, addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication and divi- 
sion. They added five more using 
square roots (of course only the 
roots of 4 and 9 are actually 



useful in this short sequence of 
numbers) and, as if this were not 
enough, they found two equations 
using factorials and four more 
using factorials and the square 
root of nine. 

In their first sixteen they 
duplicated K.7. The others are: 



12-3 + (4X5) + 6 + (7X8) + 9 =100 
— 1 — (2X3X4) + 56 + 78-9 = 100 

(1X2)— 3 + 4 + (56:7) + 89 = 100 

1 + 2 — (3X4) — 5 + (6X7) + (8X9) = 100 
-1 + [(2:3)45) +6 + (7X8) + 9 = 100 
— 1 + (23X4) + 56— (7X8) + 9 -= 100 
1 + (2X3) + (4X5) — 6 + 7 + (8X9) = 100 
(-1 + 2)(3 + 4)(5 + 6):7 + 89 = 100 
(— 1 +2X3+4 + 5 + 6— 7) + 89= 100 
1 + 2 + 34—5 + 67—8 + 9 = 100 

— 1 + 2 + 3 +- (4X5X6X7:8) — 9 = 100 
(—1 + 2)34 + 56—7 + 8 + 9 = 100 

(1X2) + 3 + 45 + 67— 8— 9 = 100 

(— 1 + 2)3 + 4(— 56 + 78) + 9 = 100 



These are the simple equation. 
Actually the others really are no 
more complicated but some read- 
ers may not know what a factorial 
is. Well, a factorial is the figure 
you get when you multiply all 
integers up to the number. Fac- 
torial five (written 5!) is 1 X 2 
X 3 X 4 X 5 = 120. Here are 
the two solutions: 

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.'— 6— 7— 8— 9 = 100 
1 + 2 + (3X4!)— 5 + 6 + 7+ 8 + 9 = 100 

And finally the five involving 
square roots: 



— 1 + (2X3X4X5:6) + 78 + V9 
12 + 34+ 56— 7 + 8— V9 
1—2 + (3X4) + (5X6) + (7X8) + V9 
1 + 2 + (3X4X5) + (6X7) — 8 + V9 
— 1 + 23 + V4— 5— 6 + 78 + 9 



100

I feel sure that there are still 
more solutions. But for the mo- 
ment we have enough.

T HE GIRL’S one duty was 
to look — and under- 
stand: 

White flatness of the wide wall 
dissolved into mist as the room 
dimmed. Then whiteness itself 
broke apart, from all-color to 
each component. 

Pinpoints of brightness swirled 
and coalesced into new patterns 
of color and shape. Pinks and 
yellows here. Silver, blue, black 
there. Brown, gray, green. Rain- 
bow stripes. 

First flat, like a painted scene, 
then deepening to its own kind 
of reality, the scene glowed in 
the center of nothingness where 
the wall had been before. 

The scene had been exactly 
the same before, she remem- 
bered. There was the strangely 
clear-air atmosphere, thin and 
sharp. The sketched-in effect of 
the background — hills, oddly 
shaped? A domed structure 
closer? — was simply a matter 
of her • focused attention, not 
distance haze. Through this 
transparent air detailed vision 
would be possible at a far dis- 
tance. And the background hills 
were far; for the moment, how- 
ever, they were only background. 

What counted was front-cen- 
ter, bright-colored ... as real 
as when she had seen it the 
first time, for herself. 

The three footprints. The 
shoe. The square of cloth. The 



three bushes. In color, focus and 
meaning they were identical. Her 
own shoe, with the silly spike 
heel and lacy strap unfastened, 
was lying where it dropped on 
the pink-hued sand, alongside 
the alien prints. The first time 
she had not known why, exactly, 
the prints were “alien.” Now she 
saw it was the shoe that ac- 
complished the effect. Plenty of 
three-toed things left prints in 
sand, but nothing exactly the 
length of her own foot was tri- 
partite. 

Nothing on Earth. 

It was the same thing with 
the brown-gray-green thorn 
bushes . planted, she sud- 
denly realized, by some insane 
gardener, to landscape that 
circular blockhouse thing in the 
background! Or maybe not so in- 
sane. Nowhere else in sight was 
there a growing or green thing 
at all. Poor green was better 
than none. Spikes, spines and 
thorns did grow. They were 
alive, if still — alien? Why? Of 
course, the same thing. The pat- 
terned robe. A square of cloth, 
from the same bolt from which 
she had made the robe, only 
last week, hung impaled on the 
farthest bush. 

Farthest? Nearest! Nearest to 
the door of the house, from 
which the strange footprints 
curved down and off-scene. 

Half the wall was filled now. 

GALAXY 



Inch by slow fraction of inch the 
scene widened. She sat forward, 
breathing almost not at all, 
tensed with knowing the next 
print,' or the one beyond it, 
would contain the print-maker, 
the — alien. 

Alien? What- an odd thought! 
That was the second — the 
third? — time she’d thought it. 
She did not remember the 
thought from the first seeing of 
the same scene. “Strange,” 
maybe. “Unknown.” Not “alien.” 

Odd . Odder still, as her 
eyes went unwillingly from the 
forming print at the far edge of 
the scene, she saw her own 
sandal alongside the trail, silly 
spike heel and lacy strap, still 
fastened as it had been on her 
foot . 

That wasn’t just odd. It was 
wrong! And the torn strip of 
fabric ripped from her robe by 
the thornbush — 

“That’s not how it was! That’s 
not the way it went,” she 
thought, and the scene faded out. 

The light brightened in the 
room as the wall came back to 
normality, and she realized that 
she had not just thought it, but 
spoken aloud. 

64 r |' , HIS IS his, remember?” 
Gordon was smiling. “Only 
the very first frame is identical. 
It starts branching off right 
away. The colors, for instance?” 



Ruth thought back and of 
course he was right. Hers had 
been much yellower. Pink sand 
was absurd. 

She laughed out loud, at the 
absurdity of thinking anything 
in the projection absurd. Then 
she explained. “Pink sand. I was 
thinking how silly that was, and 
then I remembered that mine 
had little pink clouds floating 
over my pure yellow desert! Why 
on Earth do you think he’d have 
pink sand, though?” 

Gordon smiled again as she 
realized how her own question 
had answered itself. “. on 
Earth . .” she had said. Of 
course. Why should it be Earth 
at all? 

With the questioning thought 
came concern. Why had hers 
been on Earth? Did that mean 
. .? Were they showing her 
Charles’s sequence just to ex- 
plain, in the kindest way, why 
she failed? 

She wouldn’t finish the 
thoughts, even in her own head. 
But Gordon was chuckling 
quietly as he watched her. Of 
course he knew what had been 
crossing her — face, she decided, 
as well as her mind! Other 
people had been through this 
whole thing before. Half of them 
must have gone through the 
same thoughts. 

Half of them would have 
been worried . and how many

of them had good cause to be? 

“Relax, Ruth,” he said warmly. 
“You haven’t failed or passed 
yet. There’s a lot more to it 
than the sequence. But I can tell 
you that it makes no difference 
where you make the setting, or 
when. At least — ” he frowned 
faintly, and she knew it was im- 
patience with his own impreci- 
sion in a vital communication. 
“At least, it makes no more dif- 
ference — and no less — than 
your choice of colors or textures. 
A good bit less difference than 
clothing, for instance.” 

She looked at him gratefully. 

“All right,” she said. “I’ll try 
to forget my own sequence.” 

“The best way is just to let 
yourself go, as completely as 
you can. There’s no harm in 
being aware of the difference, 
just so you aren’t contrasting. It 
won’t rationalize. But you don’t 
have to stop being you to be 
him for a while, you know.” He 
smiled again. 

She nodded and grinned. Some 
things did not have to be ver- 
balized. 

She shivered and settled back, 
ready to watch — to feel, to 
know, be, exist — in his mind 
and body. 

Gordon didn’t say any more. 
The room dimmed again, and 
once more the misting wall 
focused the scene. 

When it had covered the wall, 



Ruth had forgotten that there 
was a wall there at all. Or that 
she was herself. 

More completely than ever 
before, or again (unless and 
until they fused to a new per- 
son, their child) she was one 
with the man who had made 
her his own. 

r T'HE trail of prints led tanta- 
lizingly out of sight, curving 
away behind a low ridge . of 
dunes. Unless the creature, what- 
ever it was, moved much more 
swiftly than the prints pro- 
mised, it had been more than a 
few minutes since it happened. 

He looked again at her slipper 
dropped on its side in the sand. 
The first glimpse had been 
more incongruous than any- 
thing else. The alienness of the 
prints contrasted ridiculously 
with the spiced femininity of 
Ruth’s shoe on the orange-pink 
sand. Now it seemed to him 
that the slipper was not dropped 
but thrown. Or kicked. 

Kicked off her foot? For the 
first time, fear grabbed him, a 
clawed fist of ice in his belly 
that turned him to look again at 
the bright rainbow of stuff 
draped and torn on the edge 
of the bush near the door. It 
was part of the skirt of the new 
robe, the one she made herself 
last week, after he noticed the 
new fabric in the shop window. 



146 



GALAXY 



He had liked it; so she had 
bought it and fashioned into a 
garment to please him. Now it 
hung cruelly torn by spiked 
thorns. And she — 

He tore himself loose from the 
immobility of anxiety, and ran 
for the house. Somewhere in 
back of his mind the question 
was registered: What shop? 

Where? The nearest shop was 
forty million miles away. The 
question was registered, filed, and 
ticketed for later thought. 

Right now he could not even 
stop to wonder why he had not 
noticed the door before. He had 
to have seen it, when he saw 
the bush. How do you not notice 
that the thick door of a pressure 
hut has been torn loose from its 
hinges? What kind of wild man 
speculates about his wife’s robe 
when his home, in which he left 
her safe and protected, no more 
than five hours ago, has been 
violated? 

That was a dangerous word. 
He unthought it, and the red 
haze cleared away. He could see 
again. 

“Ruth!” he shouted. “Ruth'.” 

No answer. He had known 
there could not be one. “Ruth!” 
he kept shouting to thin-aired 
emptiness inside the dome that 
had been — five short hours ago 
— rich with Earth air and scents, 
sounds and solidity: Ruth. 

His gun hung by the door. It 



had been a joke, he remembered. 
Pioneers ought to keep a gun by 
the front door. Damn right they 
should! He grabbed it as he 
ran, stride unbroken. He tore off 
down the trail of the monstrous 
prints, past the bushes and the 
sandal, fifty feet more. His lungs 
were on fire inside him. He 
would have cursed in his futility, 
but there was no strength or 
breath for self-anger; not even, 
just now, for anger better placed. 
It was not even possible now to 
run back to the copter. He had 
wasted too much strength. He 
had to drag himself full length 
along the sand, catching and 
holding the thin concentration of 
lichen’s oxygen at the sand sur- 
face. 

Inside the copter, lungs full 
again, he was coasting along 
fifteen feet above the prints of 
horned three-toed feet. He had 
time enough, and more than he 
wanted, to think and to question 
his idiocies. As if he had for- 
gotten where he was. At the 
first hint of danger they faced 
he went into shock. As if he 
were back on Earth, wrapped in 
her warm air, strong-armed 
gravity. 

Ancestral memories reacting 
for him in moment of panic? He 
sneered back at himself for that 
kind of excuse. The only part 
that applied was the single 
word, “panic.” 



THE DEEP DOWN DRAGON 



147 



He’d panicked. Okay. Don’t 
forget it, boy. But don’t let it 
slow you down, either. File for 
future reference. Take it out 
and examine it — later. Mean- 
time, what counts is down there. 
Right now, you’re just a pair of 
eyes. Later you may get to be 
arms and legs, a back, if you’re 
lucky a gun. Right now — just 
eyes. And a computer. 

He studied the prints. Two- 
footed or four? He couldn’t de- 
cide — and then he saw the 
pattern, and it was not two or 
four, but three. Three? Distrib- 
ute N pounds of weight — 
divided at any time on two of 
three feet, in prints that each 
dug in deeper than his own foot 
woqld, with his full weight on 
it. The damn thing was big. N 
pounds was too many. 

That didn’t make sense. What 
kind of Thing made prints like 
that on Mars? On a planet whose 
largest life-form was adapted to 
breathing air no more than two 
feet above ground? And even 
those didn’t cross desert dryness. 
They lived in the still thinly 
moist and green valley of old 
sea bottoms. 

The error was obvious. What 
kind of creature could make a 
print like a man’s, on Mars? 
Largest native life-form, he had 
meant. So this Thing, with three- 
toed, three-legged stride, hard- 
bottomed foot digging too deep 



in dry sand, had a stride barely 
more than a man’s, one meter 
maybe from print to print along 
the trail. It was not long enough 
to be that heavy. Not man, not 
Martian. Something else. 

Alien. 

He tried to think more, but 
either there were no more clues 
or the block was too great. 
Alien, from where? No way to 
know. What for? Where to? 
Why? When? 

For the moment, the “when” 
was what counted the most. 
Whatever and whyever. It had 
Ruth with It. Was she still 
alive? Did she have an oxytank? 

He tried to remember, aside 
from the door, what signs of 
violence, struggle or damage he’d 
seen in the house. He remem- 
bered none. The door, the robe 
and the slipper. That was all. 

f |''EN minutes after the copter 
lifted, he came to the first 
rock outcroppings. For a while 
after that he could still follow 
the trail without too much 
trouble. The creature tended to 
stay on the sand-drifted crevices 
between hills. There were still 
plenty of prints clear enough to 
be seen from the height he had 
to maintain to stay clear of the 
jagged-edged, sand-scoured shapes 
of bare hilltops. But as the 
ground level rose, there was less 
and less sand between rocks to 



148 



GALAXY 



catch imprints, and it was more 
difficult to peer down and navi- 
gate at the same time. 

Hard to say if he would be 
better off on ‘the ground. He 
could spend hours trying wrong 
passages, backing and trying 
again, to search out the scat- 
tered prints that made the only 
trail now. Circling above, he 
could save time — maybe. Cer- 
tainly, if he could stay in the 
air, he kept an advantage he’d 
never have face to face. (Face 
to chest? belly? thigh? No way 
at all to judge relative height.) 
Not to mention armament, gen- 
eral equipment. Inside the cop- 
ter, he had the distilled and 
neatly packaged essence of 
Earth technology to fight for 
him. On foot in the hills, with 
whatever he could carry on his 
own back — ? 

It was obvious he had no 
choice. He had just noticed the 
time. Twilight would fall fast 
and dark across him in a half 
hour or less. Moonless, or as 
good as moonless, dark would 
follow short minutes after. The 
kind of cross-eyed trail-follow- 
ing and peak-hopping he could 
barely manage in sunlight would 
then be impossible. Find a place 
where he could land, then. Now, 
quickly, while he still could. 

The copter dropped, and he 
found a ledge just firm and wide 
enough. Charles went methodi- 



cally.. through lockers, picking 
and choosing, till at last he had 
a pile he thought he could man- 
age, with all the essentials, in 
one form or other. 

Searchlight, rope, hand pick- 
axe, knife. Pistol-grip torch, 
which he thought of as a flame 
thrower. Plain old pistol. Extra 
airtank. Extra mask. Light warm 
blanket. Bullets, and gas for the 
torch. Food concentrates. Two 
water flasks. He climbed into his 
heat suit, discarded the blanket, 
and took her suit instead. He 
had thought to make a knapsack 
of the blanket, carrying the rest 
of the stuff on his back, but that 
was silly. He had to be able 
to get at whatever he needed, 
but fast. He got out a package 
of clip-back hooks and studded 
his suit with them, hanging him : 
self like a grim Christmas tree 
inside-out: bright flame-red suit 
underneath; dull gray, brown 
and black tanks, handles, tools 
and weapons dangling all around. 

He practiced bending over, 
sitting, squatting, reaching. He 
could climb. Okay. The weight 
was going to be hard to handle, 
but not impossible. 

He added one more airtank, 
and one more flask. If it all got 
too heavy, he could leave a trail 
of his own behind him. At least 
the stuff would be nearer than 
here in the copter. He was half 
out of the hatch when he re- 



THE DEEP DOWN DRAGON

membered it: The first aid kit. 

He started into the hills with 
his searchlight flooding the pass 
at his feet just as darkness col- 
lapsed from the sky. He won- 
dered as he stumbled forward 
and up — following an edge of 
toe here, of heel there — what 
else he had not thought to take. 

fT'HEN the glare of light glinted 
■*- off redness on rockside. A 
smear, that’s all. Red blood. Not 
alien. Ruth’s! 

His gloved hand reached out, 
and the red smudged. Still wet? 
Impossible. In this atmosphere, 
the seconds they’d need to get 
out of sight would have dried 
blood. He looked closely at his 
gauntlet and moved forward 
more swiftly, with an exulta- 
tion of knowledge and purpose 
he had not dared let himself 
hold until then. It was not blood. 
It was spilled red powder. Rouge! 
She was alive, able to think, to 
act! She knew he would have 
to come after, and she was help- 
ing by leaving a trail. 

He no longer followed foot- 
prints. He followed the crimson 
trail blazes. And wondered how 
far back they’d started, how 
much time he might have gained 
had he abandoned the copter 
sooner. 

No use wondering. No use 
thinking back. Now it was only 
the next moment and the next. 



Was he gaining or losing? This 
he had to know. He was travel- 
ing at his best speed. He went 
faster. If he lost ground now, 
he had no chance. The creature 
was making a path as straight as 
the hard rockside hills would 
permit; It knew where It was 
headed. The Thing could not 
climb, that was clear, so It would 
not have gone through the hills 
without cause. But wherever It 
was headed, presumably that 
spot offered It some protection. 
He had to find It and head It 
off first. 

He found he could go faster 
still. And then, suddenly, he 
knew he’d better slow down. It 
was nothing he’d seen — surely 
nothing he’d heard. Inside the 
suit hood, even such sounds as 
carried through the thin air were 
stilled. Well, then. 

He opened the mask, and he 
did hear. Maybe it was some 
vibration of the Thing’s tread 
through the rock that had 
warned him first. Well, he 
would not give himself away by 
the same carelessness. He knew 
he was very close to It now. 

He moved so carefully after 
that, it seemed agonizingly as if 
he were once more crawling 
belly-flat. But he knew he was 
gainfhg on them. The Thing was 
really slow! 

He was close. Fool! he thought 
angrily, as he switched his light 



150 



GALAXY 



off. Creep up on the Thing with 
a searchlight to flood the scene 
in advance! The suit had an in- 
frascope in the visor. He’d have 
had to close it soon anyhow. 
Five minutes was about maxi- 
mum breathing without a tank; 
unless you cared to drag your- 
self flat as he’d done earlier. 

The black-light scope came on. 
Charles paused with a new cer- 
tainty under an overhang of 
rock at the next bend. And saw 
the Thing. And his wife. 

TTE NOTICED, in a detached 
and extremely calm way, 
that what happened next all hap- 
pened in seconds. Maybe a min- 
ute at most. No more, because 
with the sharp self-awareness ex- 
ploding inside him, he could 
count his breaths while he did 
all the rest. 

He inhaled exactly three times 

— deeply, evenly — while it 
occurred. 

Before the first breath, there 
was again the ice-fingered grip 
of fear twisting his gut, squeez- 
ing the strength and air out of 
him. 

He inhaled then. And let the 
retinal image go to his brain, 
instead of his belly. 

It was twice the height of a 
man, weirdly elongated, the 
tripod base all ropy tendon, thin 
and hard. The trunk — thorax? 

— chest? — well, whatever, 



shelled or spacesuited or some- 
thing, but shiny-hard — bulked 
enormous, four feet around 
surely at the center. At least 
four. And the Thing’s head was 
turned just far enough to the 
side so that Charles could see 
clearly that his wife’s face was 
in the gaping, reptilian maw of 
the Thing. 

It held her under one arm. 
Her feet kicked at its side. It 
seemed not to notice. Her arm, 
with the bright metal cosmetic 
case clutched in her hand, swung 
wide, reaching to hit the canyon 
wall whenever it could. Her 
head was half into the creature’s 
mouth, firmly held, chin and fore- 
head, by its enormous stretched 
lips. 

While he drew in the first 
breath, he saw all this clearly 
and knew he dared not act in 
such a way as to make It bite 
down — from fear or anger, 
made no difference. Charles 
could not see inside the great 
maw. What kind of teeth, what 
harm had been done, what could 
be done, he did not know . 
and knew he could not risk. He 
thought through and rejected five 
separate plans, while his hands 
found the items he’d need. He 
drew a new breath, and his legs 
moved beneath him. 

He could not shoot first. And 
he could not simply follow and 
learn more about the Thing. Be-

cause another image came 
through from somewhere — the 
same eyes that watched every 
move of the Thing? Unlikely, 
but it had to be — of the 
gleaming column of metal too 
close ahead. A Thing-ship. So: 
no time. 

He leaped, knife in hand. 
Pricked the creature, and jumped 
back. 

It worked, as he’d prayed; no; 
as he had known, not just hoped 
or prayed, that it must. The 
Thing jumped, turned to look 
— and released his wife’s head. 

He did not waste effort in 
looking, but saw anyhow that her 
face was unharmed. He jumped 
again, drawing the third breath, 
and pricked at the arm that 
held her. She squirmed and 
pushed, exactly on time, like a 
part of himself — which she 
was — and her body was clear 
of his as he emptied the pistol 
at Its head. 

He reached for the torch. 

By that time he could not 
stop himself. He would have 
avoided the torch if he could. 
As it was he thundered at Ruth, 
above the explosion: “Down! 

Keep down, babe!” And the blue 
flame of released oxygen missed 
her head by a foot . 

He carried her back to the 
copter with strength he had not 
believed he could find. Nobody 
pursued. 



CHE SAT up, dazed, as the 
^ lights brightened slowly, and 
the white wall turned serenely 
opaque. She looked across at 
Gordon, and her face glowed 
with pleasure. 

“No sillier than mine was,” 
she said, laughing. “Was it?” 

“Not at all,” Gordon said. 

She sat politely, waiting. 

Gordon stood up, grinned 
down at her, and offered his 
hand. “I think they must be 
done in there,” he told her, nod- 
ding in the direction of the 
screenwall. “I imagine you’d 
like . .” He let it trail off. 

“You’re a smart old thing, 
aren’t you?” She took the hand 
and came to her feet. Then,* on 
impulse, astonished at herself, 
she stood on tiptoe and placed a 
quick kiss on his cheek. “What’s 
more, you’re a doll.” She turned 
and ran, glad but embarrassed. 

The door closed behind her. 
A mirrored door on the oppo- 
site wall opened, and a young 
man entered. Gordon greeted 
him warmly. “Well — what did 
you think?” His own enthusiasm 
was unmistakeable. 

“Outside of it being a great 
racket? Do they all react that 
way?” 

“Well, not all. Matter of fact, 
this pair is practically classical. 
You don’t often get a mesh like 
this one — you saw hers, didn’t 
you?” 



152 



GALAXY 



“I don’t think so,” the other 
said. “Unless it was one of the 
bunch you ran for us last night?” 

“Could be. She worked out a 
sort of a junior-size Tyranno- 
saur. Out of Professor Challenger 
maybe? Future-past uncertainty, 
here on Earth. Had it threaten 
the children, and just when she 
was about to sacrifice herself to 
save them, old Charlie showed 
up in the nick of time to do the 
slaying.” 

The other nodded. “It’s a 
fascinating technique,” he said. 
“Damn glad to have this chance 
to see it work. One thing I don’t 
follow — why do you show 
them each other’s? That’s pretty 
much against basic theory on 
. joint therapy, isn’t it?” 

Gordon was smiling again. 
“Well,” he said slowly. “This pair 
didn’t really take the runs for 
therapy.” He had a surprise to 
spring, and he was enjoying it. 
“You’ve heard about the new 
screening technique for colonists? 
You know the last expedition 
had only one broken couple and 
two psychotic collapses, out of 
fifty-six?” 

The younger man whistled. 
Then he understood. “This is 
how you’re doing it? Let them 
fantasy their own reactions? 
Well, hell. Sure! What’s surpris- 
ing is, nobody thought of using 
it before!” 

“Of course not. It was right 



under our noses,” Gordon said. 

They both laughed. 

“In this case,” he added, “we’ve 
got everything. His sequence 
stressed readiness, thoughtful 
preparation, careful action. You 
saw that. Hers was strongest on 
instinct, physical wisdom, that 
whole set. He was moved to do 
things he couldn’t possibly do — 
and knows he can’t, by the way 
— in real life, because she was 
in danger. Her stimulus was a 
threat to home and children. 
And even then, she made sure 
he did the actual dragon-slay- 
ing job.” He flicked a switch. 
Through the wall, now, they saw 
Ruth and Charles, standing, hold- 
ing hands, smiling and squeez- 
ing a little. That was all. 

The two doctors smiled as the 
paleskinned, ninety-five-pound, 
five-foot product of slum-crowd- 
ed Earth threw a proud arm 
around his wife’s narrow should- 
er, and led her out. 

“Doesn’t look like much of a 
dragon-slayer,” the younger one 
said. 

“No. But as long as he is . 
He paused, looked the visitor 
over with care, and said. “You 
asked about showing them to 
each other? Ever think how 
much more therapy there might 
be for him in knowing she knows 
he can handle a dragon? Or for 
her, knowing that he really can?”

THE HIGH CRUSADE by Poul 
Anderson. Doubleday & Co. 



L. SPRAGUE de Camp was the 
most noted author after Mark 
Twain to mix medievalism and 
advanced technology. Anderson’s 
latest seriously challenges the 
eminence of Divide and Rule, 
de Camp’s famous opus major. 

When Sir Roger de Tourne- 
ville was engaged in gathering 
an army to fight in France for 
his king, back in 1345, inter- 
stellar invaders had the poor 
luck to land their giant ship 
and attempt his subjugation. In 



the close fighting that ensued, 
the English mastery of man-to- 
man cutlery insured their vic- 
tory. With the star ship at his 
command and a prisoner to 
operate it, logistics were no 
longer a problem. The entire 
English town could embark on 
a Crusade against the paynims 
of the Holy Land instead of the 
intended local action against the 
French. 

Best-laid plans go notoriously 
astray, however, particularly 
when entrusted to a double-deal- 
ing ET. The ship, with its com- 
plement of armored knights,

COLLISION COURSE by Rob- 
ert Silverberg. Avalon. 

SILVERBERG’S STORY of 
first contact between alien civili- 
zations, although not fresh or 
new, is nonetheless entertaining 
and deft. 

Earth’s extrasolar empire is 
limited in its expansion by the 
speed of light. Excitement runs 
high on the return of Earth’s 
first faster-than-light ship with 
the unwelcome news of an alien 
civilization of at least equal sci- 
entific attainments — and un- 
known intentions. 

How does one negotiate a 
treaty to divide the universe 
into spheres of influence when 
even basic communication is im- 
possible? Silverberg’s solutions 
are glib but, as noted, his story 
benefits from his sure control of 
pace.

HE OWNED THE WORLD by 
Charles Eric Maine. Avalon 
Books. 

H. G. WELLS cut the basic pat- 
tern for almost every type of 
science-fiction yam, including 
the prototype for Maine’s story: 
the awakening of a long-dead 
individual to an inimical future 
over which he exercises com- 
plete economic control yet in 
which he is a helpless tool. 

Maine’s Sleeper is the first 
astronaut, unsuccessful in his at- 
tempt to orbit the moon. After 
8,000 years of burial in space in 
his rocket tomb, he is returned 
to life by Martians, descendants 
of colonizing terrestrial scien- 
tists, now at war with Mother 
Earth. 

The story is quite uneven, 
but the ending has a fillip.

TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LIT- 
TLE STAR by Ben Barzman. 
G. P. Putnam’s Sons. 

NOTED FILM author Barz- 
man’s extremely winning story 
rests on a firm foundation; 
though short on science, it is long 
on story. 

Barzman employs the well- 
worn device of a sister-world 
(populated with Terran counter- 
parts, but diverging in develop- 
ment after World War I) as a 



mirror to point up our savagery 
and stupidity. The scientific 
partnership of an English girl, 
orphaned by Nazi bombs, and 
a Rumanian refugee whose child 
and Jewish wife were extermi- 
nated during WWII, makes pos- 
sible the contact with the people 
of the utopian planet. They have 
developed far beyond us tech- 
nically but particularly in their 
ability to coexist. 

The appeal of the story lies 
in its main characters.

MISS NORTON is at the tip of

By JACK VANCE Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 
Thissell was all set. He would capture 
the wanted man the second he showed his 
face. Trouble was, he wouldn't show it! 

THE 

MOON MOTH 

T HE houseboat had been The bow bulged like a swan’s 
built to the most exacting breast, the stem rising high, then 
standards of Sirenese crooking forward to support an 
craftsmanship — which is to say, iron lantern. The doors were 
as close to the absolute as human carved from slabs of a mottled 
eye could detect. The planking black-green wood. The windows 
of waxy dark wood showed no were many-sectioned, paned with 
joints. The fastenings were plati- squares of mica that were stained 
num rivets countersunk and rose, blue, pale green and violet, 
polished flat. In style, the boat The bow was given to service 
was massive, broad-beamed, facilities and quarters for the 
steady as the shore itself, without slaves; amidships were a pair of 
ponderosity or slackness of line, sleeping cabins, a dining saloon 

and a parlor saloon, opening up- 
on an observation deck at the 
stern. 

Such was Edwer Thissell’s 
houseboat, but ownership of it 
brought him neither pleasure nor 
pride. The houseboat had become 
shabby. The carpeting had lost 
its pile; the carved screens were 
shipped; the iron lantern at the 
bow sagged with rust. Seventy 
years ago the first owner, on ac- 

THE MOON MOTH

cepting the boat, had honored the 
builder and had been likewise 
honored. The transaction (for 
the process represented a great 
deal more than simple giving and 
taking) had augmented the pres- 
tige of both. That time was far 
gone. The houseboat now com- 
manded no prestige whatever. 

Edwer Thissell, resident on 
Sirene only three months, recog- 
nized the lack but could do noth- 
ing about it: this particular 

houseboat was the best he could 
get. He sat on the rear deck 
practising the ganga, a zither-like 
instrument not much larger than 
his hand. A hundred yards 
inshore surf defined a strip 
of white beach. Beyond rose 
jungle, with the silhouette of 
craggy black hills against the 
sky. Mireille shone hazy and 
white overhead, as if through a 
tangle of spider-web; the face of 
the ocean pooled and puddled 
with mother-of-pearl luster. The 
scene had become as familiar, 
though not as boring, as the 
ganga, at which he had worked 
two hours, twanging out the 
Sirenese scales, forming chords, 
traversing simple progressions. 
Now he put down the ganga for 
the zachinko, this a small sound- 
box studded with keys, played 
with the right hand. Pressure on 
the keys forced air through reeds 
in the keys themselves, produc- 
ing a concertina-like tone. This- 




160 



sell ran off a dozen quick scales, 
making very few mistakes. Of 
the six instruments he had set 
himself to learn, the zachinko 
had proved the least refractory 
(with the exception, of course, 
of the hymerkin, that clacking, 
slapping, clattering device of 
wood and stone used exclusively 
with the slaves.) 

r T'HISSELL practiced another 
ten minutes, then put aside 
the zachinko. He flexed his arms, 
wrung his aching fingers. Every 
waking moment since his arrival 
had been given to the instru- 
ments: the hymerkin, the ganga, 
the zachinko, the kiv, the strapan, 
the gomapard. He had practiced 
scales in twenty-four keys and 
four modes, chords without num- 
ber, intervals never imagined on 
the Home Planets. Trills, arpeg- 
gios, slurs; click-stops and nasal- 
ization; damping and augmenta- 
tion of overtones, vibratos and 
wolf-tones; concavities and con- 
vexities. He practiced with a 
dogged, deadly diligence, in 
which his original concept of 
music as a source of pleasure had 
long become lost. Looking over 
the instruments Thissell resisted 
an urge to fling all six into the 
Titanic. 

He rose to his feet, went for- 
ward through the parlor saloon, 
the dining saloon, along a corri- 
dor past the galley and came out 



on the fore-deck. He bent over 
the rail, peered down into the 
underwater pens where Toby 
and Rex, the slaves, were har- 
nessing the dray-fish for the 
weekly trip to Fan, eight miles 
north. The youngest fish, either 
playful or captious, ducked and 
plunged. Its streaming black 
muzzle broke water, and Thissell, 
looking into its face felt a pecu- 
liar qualm: the fish wore no 
mask! 

Thissell laughed uneasily, fin- 
gering his own mask, which was 
in the design of the Moon-Moth. 
No question about it, he was 
becoming acclimated to Sirene! 
A significant stage had been 
reached when the naked face of a 
fish caused him shock! 

The fish were finally harnes- 
sed; Toby and Rex climbed 
aboard, red bodies glistening, 
black cloth masks clinging to 
their faces. Ignoring Thissell 
they stowed the pen and hoisted 
anchor. The dray-fish strained, 
the harness tautened, the house- 
boat moved north. 

Returning to the after-deck, 
Thissell took up the strapan — 
this a circular sound-box eight 
inches in diameter. Forty-six 
wires radiated from a central hub 
to the circumference, where they 
connected to either a bell or a 
tinkle-bar. When plucked, the 
bells rang and the bars chimed; 
when strummed, the instrument 



gave off a twanging, jingling 
sound. When played with com- 
petence, the pleasantly acid dis- 
sonances produced an expressive 
effect; in an unskilled hand, the 
results were less felicitous, and 
might even approach random 
noise. The strapan was Thissell’s 
weakest instrument. He prac- 
ticed with concentration during 
the entire trip north. 

In due course the houseboat 
approached the floating city. The 
dray-fish were curbed, the house- 
boat warped to a mooring. Along 
the dock a line of idlers weighed 
and gauged every aspect of the 
houseboat, the slaves and This- 
sell himself, according to Sir- 
enese habit. Thissell, not yet 
accustomed to such penetrating 
inspection, found the scrutiny 
unsettling, all the more so for the 
immobility of the masks. Self- 
consciously adjusting his own 
Moon-Moth, he climbed the lad- 
der to the dock. 

A SLAVE rose from where he 
had been squatting, touched 
knuckles to the black cloth at his 
forehead, and sang on a three- 
tone phrase of interrogation: 
“The Moon-Moth before me pos- 
sibly expresses the identity of 
Ser Edwer Thissell?” 

Thissell tapped the hymerkin 
which hung at his belt and sang: 
“I am Ser Thissell.” 

“I have been honored by a 



trust,” sang the slave. “Three 
days from dawn to dusk I have 
waited on the dock; three nights 
from dusk to dawn I have 
crouched on a raft below this 
same dock listening to the feet of 
the Night-men. At last I behold 
the mask of Ser Thissell.” 

Thissell evoked an impatient 
clatter from the hymerkin. 
“What is the nature of this 
trust?” 

“I carry a message, Ser This- 
sell. It is intended for you.” 
Thissell held out his left hand, 
playing the hymerkin with his 
right. “Give me the message.” 
“Instantly, Ser Thisssell.” 

The message bore a heavy 
superscription: 

EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION! 

RUSH! 

Thissell ripped open the en- 
velope. The message was signed 
by Castel Cromartin, Chief Ex- 
ecutive of the Interworld Poli- 
cies Board. After the formal 
salutation, it read: 

ABSOLUTELY URGENT 
the following orders be execu- 
ted! Aboard Carina Cruzeiro, 
destination Fan, date of arrival 
January 10 U.T., is notorious 
assassin, Haxo Angmark. Meet 
landing with adequate authority, 
effect detention and incarcera- 
tion of this man. These instruc- 
tions must be successfully 



162

THE MOON MOTH 



163 



implemented. Failure is unac- 
ceptable. 

ATTENTION! Haxo Angmark 
is superlatively dangerous. Kill 
him without hesitation at any 
show of resistance. 

Thissell considered the mes- 
sage with dismay. 

In coming to Fan as Consular 
Representative he had expected 
nothing like this. He felt neither 
inclination nor competence in the 
matter of dealing with dangerous 
assassins. Thoughtfully he rub- 
bed the fuzzy gray cheek of his 
mask. The situation was not 
completely dark; Esteban Rol- 
ver, Director of the Space-Port, 
would doubtless cooperate, and 
perhaps furnish a platoon of 
slaves. 

More hopefully, Thissell re- 
read the message. January 10, 
Universal Time. He consulted a 
conversion calendar. Today, 40th 
in the Season of Bitter Nectar — 
Thissell ran his finger down the 
column, stopped. January 10 
was today! 

A distant rumble caught his 
attention. Dropping from the 
mist came a dull shape: the 
lighter returning from contact 
with the Carina Cruzeiro. 

Thissell once more re-read the 
note, raised his head, studied the 
descending lighter. Aboard would 
be Haxo Angmark. In five min- 
utes he would emerge upon the 



soil of Sirene. Landing formali- 
ties would detain him possibly 
twenty minutes. The landing 
field lay a mile and a half dis- 
tant, joined to Fan by a winding 
path through the hills. 

'T'HISSELL turned to the slave. 

“When did this message ar- 
rive?” 

The slave leaned forward un- 
comprehendingly. Thissell reit- 
erated his question, singing to the 
clack of the hymerkin: “This 
message, you have enjoyed the 
honor of its custody how long?” 

The slave sang: “Long days 
have I waited on the wharf, re- 
treating only to the raft at the 
onset of dusk. Now my vigil is 
rewarded; I behold Ser Thissell.” 

Thissell turned away and 
walked furiously up the dock. 
Ineffective, inefficient Sirenese! 
Why had they not delivered the 
message to his houseboat? 
Twenty-five minutes — twenty- 
two now . 

At the esplanade Thissell 
stopped and looked right and 
left, hoping for a miracle — per- 
haps some sort of air-transport to 
whisk him to the space-port, 
where, with Rolver’s aid, Haxo 
Angmark might still be detained. 
Or, better yet, a second message 
canceling the first. Something, 
anything . But air-cars were 
not to be found on Sirene, and 
no second message appeared. 



164 



GALAXY 



Across the esplanade rose a 
meager row of permanent struc- 
tures, built of stone and iron and 
so proof against the efforts of 
the Night-men. A hostler occu- 
pied one of these structures, and 
as Thissell watched a man in a 
splendid pearl and silver mask 
emerged riding one of the lizard- 
like mounts of Sirene. 

Thissell sprang forward. There 
was still time; with luck he might 
yet intercept Haxo Angmark. He 
hurried across the esplanade. 

Before the line of stalls stood 
the hostler, inspecting his stock 
with solicitude, occasionally bur- 
nishing a scale or whisking away 
an insect. There were five of the 
beasts in prime condition, each 
as tall as a man’s shoulder, with 
massive legs, thick bodies, heavy 
wedge-shaped heads. From their 
fore-fangs, which had been arti- 
ficially lengthened and curved 
into near-circles, gold rings de- 
pended. Their scales had been 
stained in diaper-pattern: purple 
and green, orange and black, red 
and blue, brown and pink, yellow 
and silver. 

Thissell came to a breathless 
halt in front of the hostler. He 
reached for his kiv, then hesi- 
tated. The kiv — five banks of 
resilient metal strips, fourteen to 
the bank, played by touching, 
twisting, twanging — might not 
be appropriate. Could this be 
considered a casual personal en- 



counter? The zachinko perhaps? 
But the statement of his needs 
hardly seemed to demand the 
formal approach. Better the kiv 
after all. He struck a chord, but 
by error found himself stroking 
the ganga. 

Beneath his mask Thissell 
grinned apologetically. His re- 
lationship with this hostler was 
by no means on an intimate basis. 
He hoped that the hostler was 
of sanguine disposition, and in 
any event the urgency of the 
occasion allowed no time to 
select an exactly appropriate in- 
strument. He struck a second 
chord and, playing as well as 
agitation, breathlessness and lack 
of skill allowed, sang out a re- 
quest: “Ser Hostler, I have 

immediate need of a swift mount. 
Allow me to select from your 
herd.” 

r | ''HE hostler wore a mask 
of considerable complexity 
which Thissell could not identify: 
a construction of varnished 
brown cloth, pleated gray leather 
and high on the forehead two 
large green and scarlet globes, 
minutely segmented like insect 
eyes. He inspected Thissell a long 
moment. Then, rather ostenta- 
tiously selecting his stimic, he 
executed a brilliant progression 
of trills and rounds. 

Thissell failed to grasp the im- 
port. The stimic — three flute- 



THE MOON MOTH 



165 



like tubes equipped with 
plungers; thumb and forefinger 
squeezing a bag to force air 
across the mouthpieces, second, 
third and fourth fingers manipu- 
lating the slide — was an instru- 
ment well adapted to the 
sentiments of cool withdrawal, or 
even disapproval; but how cool 
Thissell was not sure. The hostler 
sang: “Ser Moon-Moth, I fear 
that my steeds are unsuitable to 
a person of your distinction.” 

Thissell earnestly twanged at 
the ganga. “By no means! They 
all seem adequate. I am in great 
haste and will gladly accept any 
of the group.” 

The hostler played a brittle 
cascading crescendo. “Ser Moon- 
Moth,” he sang, “the steeds are 
ill and dirty. I am flattered that 
you consider them adequate to 
your use, but I cannot accept the 
merit you offer me. And — ” 
here, switching instruments, he 
struck a cool tinkle from his 
krodatch — “somehow I fail to 
recognize the boon companion 
and co-craftsman who accosts 
me so familiarly with his ganga.” 

The implications were clear. 
The use of the krodatch alone 
made its point, for the small, 
square sound-box strung with 
resined gut, in playing which the 
musician scratched the strings 
with his fingernail, or stroked 
them with his fingertips, pro- 
duced quietly formal sounds. The 



krodatch was an instrument of 
rejection or even of insult. 
Thissell would receive no mount. 

He turned and set off at a run 
for the landing field. Behind him 
sounded the clatter of the host- 
ler’s hymerkin — whether di- 
rected at himself or at the host- 
ler’s slaves Thissell did not pause 
to learn. 

II 

T HE previous Consular Repre- 
sentative of the Home Planets 
on Sirene had been killed at Zun- 
dar. Masked as a Tavern Bravo 
he had accosted a girl beribboned 
for the Equinoctial Attitudes, a 
solecism for which he had been 
instantly beheaded by a Red 
Demiurge, a Sun Sprite and a 
Magic Hornet. Edwer Thissell, 
recently graduated from the In- 
stitute, had been named his suc- 
cessor, and allowed three days 
to prepare himself. 

Normally of a contemplative, 
even cautious, disposition. This- 
sell had regarded the appoint- 
ment as a challenge. He learned 
the Sirenese language by sub- 
cerebral techniques, and found it 
uncomplicated. Then, in the 
Journal of Universal Anthro- 
pology, he read: 

The population of the Titanic 
littoral is highly individualistic, 
possibly in response to a bounti- 



166 



GALAXY 



ful environment which puts no 
premium upon group activity. 
The language, reflecting this 
trait, expresses the individual’s 
mood, and his emotional atti- 
tude toward a given situation. 
Factual information is regarded 
as a secondary concomitant. 
Moreover, the language is sung, 
characteristically to the accom- 
paniment of a small instrument. 
As a result, there is great diffi- 
culty in ascertaining fact from 
a native of Fan, or the forbid- 
den city Zundar. One will be 
regaled with elegant arias and 
demonstrations of astonishing 
virtuosity upon one or another 
of the numerous musical instru- 
ments. The visitor to this fasci- 
nating world, unless he cares to 
be treated with the most con- 
summate contempt, must there- 
fore learn to express himself 
after the approved local fashion. 

Thissell made a note in his 
memorandum book: Procure 

small musical instrument, to- 
gether with directions as to use. 
He read on. 

There is everywhere and at 
all times a plenitude, not to say 
a superfluity, of food, and the 
climate is benign. With a fund 
of racial energy and a great deal 
of leisure time, the population 
occupies itself with intricacy. 
Intricacy in all things: intricate 
craftmanship, such as the carved 
panels which adorn the house- 
boats; intricate symbolism, as 
exemplified in the masks worn 

THE MOON MOTH 



by everyone; the intricate half- 
musical language which admi- 
rably expresses subtle moods 
and emotions; and, above all, 
the fantastic intricacy of inter- 
personal relationships. Prestige, 
face, mana, repute, glory: the 
Sirenese word is strakh. Every 
man has his characteristic 
strakh, which determines wheth- 
er, when he needs a houseboat, 
he will be urged to avail him- 
self of a floating palace, rich 
with gems, alabaster lanterns, 
peacock faience and carved 
wood, or grudgingly permitted 
an abandoned shack on a raft. 
There is no medium of ex- 
change on Sirene; the single and 
sole currency is strakh. 

Thissell rubbed his chin and 
read further. 

Masks are worn at all times, 
in accordance with the philos- 
ophy that a man should not be 
compelled to use a similitude 
foisted upon him by factors 
beyond his control. In the Siren- 
ese view, he should be at liberty 
to choose that semblance most 
consonant with his strakh. In the 
civilized areas of Sirene — 
which is to say the Titanic lit- 
toral — a man literally never 
shows his face. It is his basic 
secret. 

Gambling, by this token, is 
unknown on Sirene. It would be 
catastrophic to Sirenese self-re- 
spect to gain advantage by 
means other than the exercise 
of strakh. The word “luck” has 

167 



no counterpart in the Sirenese 
language. 

Thissell made another note: 
Get mask. Museum? Drama 
guild? 

He finished the article, has- 
tened forth to complete his prep- 
arations, and the next day 
embarked aboard the Robart 
Astroguard for the first leg of the 
passage to Sirene. 

T HE lighter settled upon the 
Sirenese space-port, a topaz 
disk isolated among the black, 
green and purple hills. The 
lighter grounded, and Edwer 
Thissell stepped forth. He was 
met by Esteban Rolver, the local 
agent for Spaceways. Rolver 
threw up his hands, and stepped 
back. “Your mask,” he cried 
huskily. “Where is your mask?” 
Thissell held it up rather self- 
consciously. “I wasn’t sure — ” 
“Put it on,” said Rolver, turn- 
ing away. He himself wore a fab- 
rication of dull green scales on 
blue-lacquered wood. Black 
quills protruded at the cheeks, 
and under his chin hung a black 
and white checked pom-pom, the 
total effect creating a sense of 
sardonic supple personality. 

Thissell adjusted the mask to 
his face, undecided whether to 
make a joke about the situation 
or to maintain a reserve suitable 
to the dignity of his post. 



“Are you masked?" Rolver in- 
quired over his shoulder. 

Thissell replied in the affirma- 
tive and Rolver turned. The 
mask hid the expression of his 
face, but his hand unconsciously 
flicked a set of keys strapped to 
his thigh. The instrument 
sounded a trill of shock and po- 
lite consternation. “You can’t 
wear that mask!” sang Rolver. 
“In fact — how did you get it?” 
“It’s copied from a mask 
owned by the Polypolis mu- 
seum,” said Thissell stiffly. “I’m 
sure it’s authentic.” 

Rolver nodded, his own mask 
more sardonic-seeming than ever. 
“It’s authentic enough. It’s a vari- 
ant of the type known as the 
Sea-Dragon Conqueror, and is 
worn on ceremonial occasions by 
persons of enormous prestige: 
princes, heroes, master craftsmen, 
great musicians.” 

“I wasn’t aware — ” 

Rolver made a gesture of lan- 
guid understanding. “It’s some- 
thing you’ll learn in due course. 
Notice my mask. Today I’m 
wearing a Tarn-Bird. Persons of 
minimal prestige — such as you, 
I, any other out-worlder — 
wear this sort of thing.” 

“Odd,” said Thissell as they 
started across the field toward a 
low concrete blockhouse. “I 
assumed .that a person wore what- 
ever mask he liked.” 

“Certainly,” said Rolver.

“Wear any mask you like — if 
you can make it stick. This Tarn- 
Bird for instance. I wear it to 
indicate that I presume nothing. 
I make no claims to wisdom, 
ferocity, versatility, musicianship, 
truculence or any of a dozen 
other Sirenese virtues.” 

“For the sake of argument,” 
said Thissell, “what would hap- 
pen if I walked through the 
streets of Zundar in this mask?” 

T>OLVER laughed, a muffled 
sound behind his mask. “If 
you walked along the docks of 
Zundar — there are no streets 
— in any mask, you’d be killed 
within the hour. That’s what 
happened to Benko, your prede- 
cessor. He didn’t know how to 
act. None of us out-worlders 
know how to act. In Fan we’re 
tolerated — so long as we keep 
our place. But you couldn’t even 
walk around Fan in that regalia 
you’re sporting now. Somebody 
wearing a Fire-Snake or a 
Thunder Goblin mask would step 
up to you. He’d play his krodatch, 
and if you failed to challenge his 
audacity with a passage on the 
skaranyi, a devilish instrument, 
like a baby bagpipe, he’d play his 
hymerkin — the instrument we 
use with the slaves. That’s the 
ultimate expression of contempt. 
Or he might ring his dueling-gong 
and attack you then and there.” 

“I had no idea that people here 



were quite so irascible,” said 
Thissell in a subdued voice. 

Rolver shrugged and swung 
open the massive steel door into 
his office. “Certain acts may not 
be committed even on the Con- 
course at Polypolis without incur- 
ring criticism.” 

“Yes, that’s quite true,” said 
Thissell. He looked around the 
office. “Why all the concrete and 
steel?” 

“Protection against the sav- 
ages,” said Rolver. “They come 
down from the mountains at 
night, steal what’s available, kill 
anyone they find ashore.” He 
went to a closet and brought forth 
a mask. “Here. Use this Moon- 
Moth; it won’t get you in trouble.” 
Thissell unenthusiastically in- 
spected the mask. It was con- 
structed of mouse-colored fur. 
There was a tuft of hair at each 
side of the mouth-hole, a pair of 
feather-like antennae at the fore- 
head. White lace flaps dangled 
beside the temples, and under the 
eyes hung a series of red folds, 
creating an effect at once lugu- 
brious and comic. 

Thissell asked, “Does this mask 
signify any degree of prestige?” 
“Not a great deal.” 

“After all, I’m Consular Repre- 
sentative,” said Thissell. “I rep- 
resent the Home Planets, a 
hundred billion people — ” 

“If the Home Planets want 
their representative to wear a Sea 



THE MOON MOTH 



169 



Dragon Conqueror mask, they’d 
better send out a Sea Dragon 
Conqueror man.” 

“I see,” said Thissell in a sub- 
dued voice. 

R OLVER politely averted his 
gaze while Thissell doffed 
the Sea Dragon Conqueror and 
slipped the more modest Moon- 
Moth over his head. “I suppose I 
can find something just a bit more 
suitable in one of the shops,” 
Thissell said. “I’m told a person 
simply goes in and takes what he 
needs, correct?” 

Rolver surveyed Thissell criti- 
cally. “That mask — temporarily, 
at least — is perfectly suitable. 
It’s rather important not to take 
anything from the shops until you 
know the strakh value of the ar- 
ticle you want. The owner loses 
prestige if a person of low strakh 
makes free with his best work.” 
Thissell shook his head in ex- 
asperation. “Nothing of this was 
explained to me! I knew of the 
masks, of course, and the pains- 
taking integrity of the craftsmen, 
but this insistence on prestige — 
strakh, whatever the word is . .” 
“No matter,” said Rolver. 
“After a year or two you’ll begin 
to learn your way around. I sup- 
pose you speak the language?” 
“Oh, indeed. Certainly.” ’ 
“And what instruments do you 
play?” 

“Well — I was given to under- 



stand that any small instrument 
was adequate, or that I could 
merely sing.” 

“Very inaccurate. Only slaves 
sing without accompaniment. I 
suggest that you learn the follow- 
ing instruments as quickly as 
possible: the hymerkin for your 
slaves. The ganga for conversation 
between intimates or one a trifle 
lower than yourself in strakh. The 
kiv for casual polite intercourse. 
The zachinko for more formal 
dealings. The strapan or the 
krodatch for your social inferiors 
— in your case, to insult some- 
one, since you have no inferiors. 
The gomapard or the double-kam- 
anthil for ceremonials.” The gom- 
apard was one of the few electric 
instruments used on Sirene. An 
oscillator produced an oboe-like 
tone, modulated, choked, vibrated, 
raised and lowered in pitch by 
four keys. The double-kamanthil 
was similar to the ganga, except 
the tones were produced by twist- 
ing and inclining a disk of resined 
leather against one or more of the 
forty-six strings. Rolver consid- 
ered a moment. “The crebarin, the 
water-lute and the slobo are 
highly useful also — but perhaps 
you’d better learn the other in- 
struments first. They should pro- 
vide at least a rudimentary 
means of communication.” 

“Aren’t you exaggerating?” 
suggested Thissell. “Or joking?” 
Rolver laughed his saturnine 



170 



GALAXY 



laugh. “Not at all. Also you’ll 
need a houseboat and slaves.” 

¥3 OLVER took Thissell from 
the landing field to the docks 
of Fan, a walk of an hour and a 
half along a pleasant path under 
enormous trees loaded with fruit, 
cereal pods, sacs of sugary sap. 

“At the moment,” said Rolver, 
“there are only four out-worlders 
in Fan, counting yourself. I’ll 
take you to Welibus, our Com- 
mercial Factor. I think he’s got an 
old houseboat he might let you 
use.” 

Comely Welibus had resided 
fifteen years in Fan, acquiring 
sufficient strakh to wear his South 
Wind mask with authority. This 
consisted of a blue disk inlaid 
with cabochons of lapis-lazuli, 
surrounded by an aureole of 
shimmering snake-skin. Heartier 
and more cordial than Rolver, he 
not only provided Thissell with a 
houseboat, but also a score of 
various musical instruments and 
a pair of slaves. 

Embarrassed by the largesse, 
Thissell stammered something 
about payment, but Welibus cut 
him off with an expansive gesture. 
“My dear fellow, this is Sirene. 
Such trifles cost nothing.” 

“But a houseboat — ” 

Welibus played a courtly little 
flourish on his kiv. “I’ll be frank, 
Ser Thissell. The boat is old and 
a trifle shabby. I can’t afford to 



use it; my status would suffer.” 
A graceful melody accompanied 
his words. “Status as yet need 
not concern you. You require 
merely shelter, comfort and 
safety from the Night-men.” 

“Night-men?” 

“The cannibals who roam the 
shore after dark.” 

“Oh yes. Ser Rolver mentioned 
them.” 

“Horrible things. We don’t dis- 
cuss them.” A shuddering little 
trill issured from his kiv. “Now, 
as to slaves.” He tapped the blue 
disk of his mask with a thought- 
ful forefinger. “Rex and Toby 
should serve you well.” He raised 
his voice, played a swift clatter 
on the hymerkin. “Avan esx 
trobu!” 

A female slave appeared wear- 
ing a dozen tight bands of pink 
cloth, and a dainty black mask 
sparkling with mother-of-pearl se- 
quins. 

“Fascu etz Rex ae Toby.” 

Rex and Toby appeared, wear- 
ing loose masks of black cloth, 
russet jerkins. Welibus addressed 
them with a resonant clatter of 
hymerkin, enjoining them to the 
service of their new master, on 
pain of return to their native is- 
lands. They prostrated them- 
selves, sang pledges of servitude 
to Thissell in soft husky voices. 
Thissell laughed nervously and 
essayed a sentence in the Sirenese 
language. “Go to the houseboat, 



THE MOON MOTH 



171 



Ill 



clean it well, bring aboard a 
supply of food.” 

Toby and Rex stared blankly 
through the holes in their masks. 
Welibus repeated the orders with 
hymerkin accompaniment. The 
slaves bowed and departed with- 
out farewells. 

Thissell surveyed the musical 
instruments with dismay. “I 
haven’t the slightest idea how to 
go about learning how to play 
these things.” 

Welibus turned to Rolver. 
“What about Kershaul? Could he 
be persuaded to give Ser Thissell 
some basic instruction?” 

Rolver nodded judicially. “Ker- 
shaul might undertake the job.” 
Thissell asked, “Who is Ker- 
shaul?” 

“The third of our little group 
of expatriates,” replied Welibus, 
“An anthropologist. You’ve read 
Zundar the Splendid? Rituals of 
Sirene? The Faceless Folk? No? 
A pity. All excellent works. Ker- 
shaul is high in prestige, and I 
believe visits Zundar from time 
to time. Wears a Cave-Owl, some- 
times a Star Wanderer or even a 
Wise Arbiter.” 

“He’s taken to an Equatorial 
Serpent,” said Rolver. ‘The vari- 
ant with the gilt tusks.” 

“Indeed!” marveled Welibus. 
“Well, I must say he’s earned it. 
A fine fellow, good chap indeed.” 
And he strummed his zachinko 
thoughtfully. 



fT'HREE months passed. Under 
the tutelage of Mathew Ker- 
shaul, Thissell practiced the hy- 
merkin, the ganga, the strapan, 
the kiv, the gomapard, and the 
zachinko. The others could wait, 
said Kershaul, until Thissel had 
mastered the six basic instru- 
ments. He lent Thissell record- 
ings of noteworthy Sirenese con- 
versing in various moods and to 
various accompaniments, so that 
Thissell might learn the melodic 
conventions currently in vogue, 
and perfect himself in the niceties 
of intonation, the various 
rhythms, cross-rhythms, com- 
pound rhythms, implied rhythms 
and suppressed rhythms. Kers- 
haul professed to find Sirenese 
music a fascinating study, and 
Thissell admitted that it was 
a subject not readily exhausted. 
The quarter-tone tuning of the 
instruments admitted the use of 
twenty-four tonalities which, mul- 
tiplied by the five modes in 
general use, resulted in one hun- 
dred and twenty separate scales. 
Kershaul, however, advised that 
Thissell primarily concentrate on 
learning each instrument in its 
fundamental tonality, using only 
two of the modes. 

With no immediate business at 
Fan except the weekly visits to 
Mathew Kershaul, Thissell took 



172 



GALAXY 



his houseboat eight miles south 
and moored it in the lee of a 
rocky promontory. Here, if it had 
not been for the incessant prac- 
ticing, Thissell lived an idyllic 
life. The sea was calm and crys- 
tal-clear; the beach, fringed by 
the gray, green and purple 
foliage of the forest, lay close at 
hand if he wanted to stretch his 
legs. 

Toby and Rex occupied a pair 
of cubicles forward. Thissell had 
the after-cabins to himself. From 
time to time he toyed with the 
idea of a third slave, possibly a 
young female, to contribute an 
element of charm and gaiety to 
the menage . But Kershaul 
advised against the step, fearing 
. that the intensity of Thissell’s 
concentration might somehow be 
diminished. Thissell acquiesced 
and devoted himself to the study 
of the six instruments. 

The days passed quickly. 
Thissell never became bored 
with the pageantry of dawn and 
sunset; the white clouds and blue 
sea of noon; the night sky blazing 
with the twenty-nine stars of 
Cluster SI 1-715. The weekly 
trip to Fan broke the tedium. 
Toby and Rex foraged for food; 
Thissell visited the luxurious 
houseboat of Mathew Kershaul 
for instruction and advice. 

Then, three months after 
Thissell’s arrival, came the mes- 
sage completely disorganizing the 



routine: Haxo Angmark, assassin, 
agent provocateur, ruthless and 
crafty criminal, had come to 
Sirene. “Effect detention and in- 
carceration of this man!” read 
the orders. “Attention! Haxo 
Angmark is superlatively dan- 
gerous. Kill without hesitation!” 

r I ''HISSELL was not in the best 
of condition. He trotted fifty 
yards until his breath came in 
gasps, then walked — through 
low hills crowned with white 
bamboo and black tree-ferns; 
across meadows yellow with 
grass-nuts, through orchards and 
wild vineyards. Twenty minutes 
passed, twenty-five minutes. With 
a heavy sensation in his stomach 
Thissell knew that he was too 
late. Haxo Angmark had landed, 
and might be traversing this very 
road toward Fan. 

But along the way Thissell met 
only four persons: a boy-child in 
a mock-fierce Alk-Islander mask; 
two young women wearing the 
Red-bird and the Green-bird; a 
man masked as a Forest Goblin. 
Coming upon the man, Thissell 
stopped short. Could this be 
Angmark? 

Thissell essayed a strategem. 
He went boldly to the man, 
stared into the hideous mask. 
“Angmark,” he called in the 
language of the Home Planets, 
“you are under arrest!” 

The Forest Goblin stared un- 



THE MOON MOTH 



173 



comprehendingly, then started 
forward along the track. 

Thissell put himself in the 
way. He reached for his ganga, 
then recalling the hostler’s re- 
action, instead struck a chord on 
the zachinko. “You travel the 
road from the space-port,” he 
sang. “What have you seen 
there?” 

The Forest Goblin grasped his 
hand-bugle, an instrument used 
to deride opponents on the field 
of battle, to summon animals or 
occasionally to evince a rough 
and ready truculence. “Where I 
travel and what I see are the 
concern solely of myself. Stand 
back or I walk upon your face.” 
He marched forward. Had not 
Thissell leapt aside the Forest 
Goblin might well have made 
good his threat. 

Thissell stood gazing after the 
retreating back. Angmark? Not 
likely, with so sure a touch on 
the hand-bugle. Thissell hesi- 
tated, then turned and continued 
on his way. 

Arriving at the space-port, he 
went directly to the office. The 
heavy door stood ajar; as This- 
sell approaehed, a man appeared 
in the doorway. He wore a mask 
of dull green scales, mica plates, 
blue-lacquered wood and black 
quills — the Tarn-Bird. 

“Ser Rolver,” Thissell called 
out anxiously, “who came down 
from the Carina Cruzeiro?” 



R OLVER studied Thissell a 
long moment, “Why do you 
ask?” 

“Why do I ask?” demanded 
Thissell. “You must have seen 
the space-gram I received from 
Castel Cromartin!” 

“Oh, yes,” said Rolver. “Of 
course. Naturally.” 

“It was delivered only half an 
hour ago,” said Thissell bitterly. 
“I rushed out as fast as I could. 
Where is Angmark?” 

“In Fan, I assume,” said 
Rolver. 

Thissell cursed softly. “Why 
didn’t you delay him?” 

Rolver shrugged. “I had 
neither authority, inclination nor 
the capability to stop him.” 
Thissell fought back his an- 
noyance. In a voice of studied 
calm he said, “On the way I 
passed a man in rather a ghastly 
mask — saucer eyes, red wattles.” 
“A Forest Goblin,” said Rol- 
ver. “Angmark brought the mask 
with him.” 

“But he played the hand- 
bugle,” Thissell protested. “How 
could Angmark — ” 

“He’s well-acquainted with 
Sirene. He spent five years here 
in Fan.” 

Thissell grunted in annoyance. 
“Cromartin made no mention of 
this.” 

“It’s common knowledge,” said 
Rolver with a shrug. “He was 
Commercial Representative be- 



174 



GALAXY 



fore Welibus took over, a long 
time ago.” 

“Were he and Welibus ac- 
quainted?” 

Rolver laughed shortly. “Natu- 
rally. But don’t suspect poor 
Welibus of anything more venial 
than juggling his accounts. I as- 
sure you he’s no consort of 
assassins.” 

“Speaking of assassins,” said 
Thissell, “do you have a weapon 
I might borrow?” 

Rolver inspected him in won- 
der. “You came out here to take 
Angmark bare-handed?” 

“I had no choice,” said Thissell. 
“When Cromartin gives orders he 
expects results. In any event you 
were here with your slaves.” 
“Don’t count on me for help,” 
Rolver said testily. “I wear the 
Tarn-Bird and make no preten- 
sions of valor. But I can lend you 
a power-pistol. I haven’t used it 
recently; I won’t guarantee its 
charge.” 

“Anything is better than noth- 
ing,” said Thissell. 

Rolver went into the office and 
a moment later returned with the 
gun. “What will you do now?” 
Thissell shook his head wearily. 
“I’ll try to find Angmark in Fan. 
Or might he head for Zundar?” 
Rolver considered. “Angmark 
might be able to survive in 
Zundar. But he’d want to brush 
up on his musicianship. I imagine 
he’ll stay in Fan a few day's.” 



“But how can I find him? 
Where should I look?” 

“That I can’t say,” replied 
Rolver. “You might be safer not 
finding him. Angmark is a dan- 
gerous man.” 

r T'HISSELL returned to Fan 
■*" the way he had come. 

Where the path swung down 
from the hills into the esplanade 
a thick-walled pise-de-terre build- 
ing had been constructed. The 
door was carved from a solid 
black plank; the windows were 
guarded by enfoliated bands of 
iron. This was the office of 
Comely Welibus, Commercial 
Factor, Importer and Exporter. 
Thissell found Welibus sitting at 
his ease on the tiled verandah, 
wearing a modest adaptation of 
the Waldemar mask. He seemed 
lost in thought. He might or 
might not have recognized 
Thissell’s Moon-Moth; in any 
event he gave no signal of greet- 
ing. 

Thissell approached the porch. 
“Good morning, Ser Welibus.” 
Welibus nodded abstractedly 
and said in a flat voice, plucking 
lazily at his kradatch, “Good 
morning.” 

Thissell was rather taken 
aback. This was hardly the in- 
strument to use toward a friend 
and fellow-out-worlder, even if 
he did wear the Moon-Moth. 
Thissell said coldly, “May I 



THE MOON MOTH 



175 



ask how long you have been sit- 
ting here?” 

Welibus considered half a 
minute. When he spoke he ac- 
companied himself on the more 
cordial crebarin. But the recol- 
lection of the krodatch chord still 
rankled in Thissell’s mind. 

“I’ve been here fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Why do you 
ask?” 

“I wonder if you noticed a 
Forest Goblin pass?” 

Welibus nodded. “He went 
on down the esplanade — turned 
into that first mask shop, I 
believe.” 

Thissell hissed between his 
teeth. This would naturally be 
Angmark’s first move. “I’ll never 
find him once he changes masks,” 
he muttered. 

“Who is this Forest Goblin?” 
asked Welibus, with no more 
than casual interest. 

Thissell could see no reason to 
conceal the name. “A notorious 
criminal: Haxo Angmark.” 

“Haxo Angmark!” croaked 
Welibus, leaning back in his 
chair. “You’re sure he’s here?” 
“Reasonably sure.” 

Welibus rubbed his shaking 
hands together. “This is bad news 
— bad news indeed! He’s an 
unscrupulous scoundrel.” 

“You knew him well?” 

“As well as anyone.” Welibus 
was now accompanying himself 
with the kiv. “He held the post 



I now occupy. I came out as an 
inspector and found that he was 
embezzling some four thousand 
UMI’s a month. I’m sure he feels 
no great gratitude toward me.” 
Welibus glanced nervously up 
the esplanade. “I hope you catch 
him.” 

“I’m doing my best. He went 
into the mask shop, you say?” 
“I’m sure of it.” 

Thissell turned away. As he 
went down the path he heard the 
black plank door thud shut be- 
hind him. 

H E walked down the esplanade 
to the mask-maker’s shop, 
and paused outside as if admiring 
the display: a hundred miniature 
masks, carved from rare woods 
and minerals, dressed with em- 
erald flakes, spiderweb silk, wasp 
wings, petrified fish scales and 
the like. The shop was empty 
except for the mask-maker, a 
gnarled knotty man in a yellow 
robe, wearing a deceptively 
simple Universal Expert mask, 
fabricated from over two thou- 
sand bits of articulated wood. 

Thissell considered what he 
would say and how he would 
accompany himself, then entered. 
The mask-maker, noting the 
Moon-Moth and Thissell’s diffi- 
dent manner, continued with his 
work. 

Thissell, selecting the easiest 
of his instruments, stroked his 



176 



GALAXY 



strapan — possibly not the most 
felicitous choice, for it conveyed 
a certain degree of condescen- 
sion. Thissell tried to counteract 
this flavor by singing in warm, 
almost effusive, tones, shaking 
the strapan whimsically when he 
struck a wrong note: “A stranger 
is an interesting person to deal 
with; his habits are unfamiliar, 
he excites curiosity. Not twenty 
minutes ago a stranger entered 
this fascinating shop, to exchange 
his drab Forest Goblin for one of 
the remarkable and adventurous 
creations assembled on the 
premises.” 

The mask-maker turned This- 
sell a side glance. Without words 
he played a progression of chords 
on an instrument Thissell had 
never seen before: a flexible sac 
gripped in the palm with three 
short tubes leading between the 
fingers. When the tubes were 
squeezed almost shut and air 
forced through the slit, an oboe- 
like tone ensued. To Thissell’s 
developing ear the instrument 
seemed difficult, the mask-maker 
expert; the music conveyed a 
profound sense of disinterest. 

Thissell tried again, labori- 
ously manipulating the strapan. 
He sang, “To an out-worlder on 
a foreign planet, the voice of one 
from his home is like water to a 
wilting plant. A person who could 
unite two such persons might find 
satisfaction in such an act of 



mercy.” Even to his own ears the 
notes rang false. 

The mask-maker casually fin- 
gered his own strapan, and drew 
forth a set of rippling scales, his 
fingers moving faster than the 
eyes could follow. He sang in the 
formal style: “An artist values 
his moments of concentration. 
He does not care to spend time 
exchanging banalities with per- 
sons of at best average prestige.” 
Thissell attempted to insert a 
counter melody, but the mask- 
maker struck a new set of com- 
plex chords whose portent 
evaded Thissell’s understanding, 
and continued: “Into the shop 
comes a person who evidently 
has picked up for the first time 
an instrument of unparalleled 
complication, for the execution 
of his music is open to criticism. 
He sings of homesickness and 
longing for the sight of others 
like himself. He dissembles his 
enormous strakh behind a Moon- 
Moth, for he plays the strapan to 
a Master Craftsman, and sings 
in a voice of contemptuous rail- 
lery. The refined and creative 
artist ignores the provocation. 
He plays a polite instrument, re- 
mains noncommittal, and trusts 
that the stranger will tire of his 
sport and depart.” 

r T'HISSELL took up his kiv. 
■*- “The noble mask-maker com- 
pletely misunderstands me — ” 



THE MOON MOTH 



177 



He was interrupted by staccato 
rasping of the mask-maker’s 
strapan. “The stranger now sees 
fit to ridicule the artist’s com- 
prehension.” 

Thissell scratched furiously at 
his strapan: “To protect myself 
from the heat, I wander into a 
small and unpretentious mask- 
shop. The artisan, though still 
distracted by the novelty of his 
tools, gives promise of develop- 
ment. He works zealously to per- 
fect his skill, so much so that he 
refuses to converse with stran- 
gers, no matter what their need.” 

The mask-maker carefully laid 
down his carving tool. He rose 
to his feet, went behind a screen, 
and shortly returned wearing a 
mask of gold and iron, with sim- 
ulated flames licking up from the 
scalp. In one hand he carried a 
skaranyi, in the other a scimitar. 
He struck off a brilliant series of 
wild tones, and sang. “Even the 
most accomplished artist can 
augment his strakh by killing 
sea-monsters, Night-men and im- 
portunate idlers. Such an occa- 
sion is at hand. The artist delays 
his attack exactly ten seconds, 
because the offender wears a 
Moon-Moth.” He twirled his 
scimitar and spun it in the air. 

Thissell desperately pounded 
the strapan. “Did a Forest Goblin 
enter the shop? Did he depart 
with a new mask?” 

“Five seconds have elapsed,” 



sang the mask-maker in steady 
ominous rhythm. 

Thissell departed in frustrated 
rage. 

He crossed the square and 
stood looking up and down the 
esplanade. Hundreds of men and 
women sauntered along the 
docks, or stood on the decks of 
their houseboats, each wearing a 
mask chosen to express his mood, 
prestige and special attributes, 
and everywhere sounded the 
twitter of musical instruments. 

Thissell stood at a loss. The 
Forest Goblin had disappeared. 
Haxo Angmark walked at liber- 
ty in Fan, and Thissell had failed 
the urgent instructions of Castel 
Cromartin. 

Behind him sounded the casu- 
al notes of a kiv. “Ser Moon- 
Moth Thissell, you stand en- 
grossed in thought.” 

T HISSELL turned, to find be- 
side him a Cave-Owl, in a 
somber cloak of black and gray. 
Thissell recognized the mask, 
which symbolized erudition and 
patient exploration of abstract 
ideas. Mathew Kershaul had 
worn it on the occasion of their 
meeting a week before. 

“Good morning, Ser Kershaul,” 
muttered Thissell. 

“And how are the studies 
coming? Have you mastered the 
C-Sharp Plus scale on the goma- 
pard? As I recall, you were 



178 



GALAXY 



finding those inverse intervals 
puzzling.” 

“I’ve worked on them,” said 
Thissell in a gloomy voice. “How- 
ever, since I’ll probably be re- 
called to Polypolis, it may be all 
time wasted.” 

“Eh? What’s this?” 

Thissell explained the situa- 
tion in regard to Haxo Angmark. 
Kershaul nodded gravely. “I re- 
call Angmark. Not a gracious 
personality, but an excellent 
musician, with quick fingers and 
a real talent for new instru- 
ments.” Thoughtfully he twisted 
the goatee of his Cave Owl mask. 
“What are your plans?” 

“They’re non-existent,” said 
Thissell, playing a doleful phrase 
on the kiv. “I haven’t any idea 
what masks he’ll be wearing. 
And if I don’t know what he 
looks like, how can I find him?” 
Kershaul tugged at his goatee. 
“In the old days he favored the 
Exo-Cambian Cycle, and I be- 
lieve he used an entire set of 
Nether Denizens. Now of course 
his tastes may have changed.” 
“Exactly,” Thissell complained. 
“He might be twenty feet away 
and I’d never know it.” He 
glanced bitterly across the espla- 
nade toward the mask-maker’s 
shop. “No one will tell me any- 
thing. I doubt if they care that 
a murderer is walking their 
docks.” 

“Quite correct,” Kershaul 



agreed. “Sirenese standards are 
different from ours.” 

“They have no sense of re- 
sponsibility,” declared Thissell. 
“I doubt if they’d throw a rope 
to a drowning man.” 

“It’s true that they dislike in- 
terference,” Kershaul agreed. 
“They emphasize individual re- 
sponsiblity and self-sufficiency.” 
“Interesting,” said Thissell, 
“but I’m still in the dark about 
Angmark.” 

Kershaul surveyed him grave- 
ly. “And should you locate Ang- 
mark, what will you do then?” 
“I’ll carry out the orders of my 
superior,” said Thissell doggedly. 

“Angmark is a dangerous 
man,” mused Kershaul. “He’s got 
a number of advantages over 
you.” 

“I can’t take that into account. 
It’s my duty to send him back 
to Polypolis. He’s probably safe, 
since I haven’t the remotest idea 
how to find him.” 

T^ERSHAUL reflected. “An 
out-worlder can’t hide be- 
hind a mask, not from the Sire- 
nese at least. There are four of us 
here at Fan — Rolver, Welibus, 
you and me. If another out- 
worlder tries to set up house- 
keeping the news will get around 
in short order.” 

“What if he heads for Zundar?” 
Kershaul shrugged. “I doubt if 
he’d dare. On the other hand — ” 



THE MOON MOTH 



179 




Kershaul paused, then noting 
Thissell’s sudden inattention, 
turned to follow Thissell’s gaze. 

A man in a Forest Goblin 
mask came swaggering toward 
them along the esplanade. 

Kershaul laid a restraining 
hand on Thissell’s arm, but This- 
sell stepped out into the path 
of the Forest Goblin, his bor- 
rowed gun ready. “Haxo Ang- 
mark,” he cried, “don’t make a 
move, or I’ll kill you. You’re un- 
der arrest.” 

“Are you sure this is Ang- 
mark?” asked Kershaul in a 
worried voice. 

“I’ll find out,” said Thissell. 
“Angmark, turn around, hold up 
your hands.” 

The Forest Goblin stood rigid 
with surprise and puzzlement. He 
reached to his zachinko, played 
an interrogatory arpeggio and 
sang, “Why do you molest me, 
Moon-Moth?” 

Kershaul stepped forward and 
played a placatory phrase on his 
slobo. “I fear that a case of con- 
fused identity exists, Ser Forest 
Goblin. Ser Moon-Moth seeks an 
out-worlder in a Forest Goblin 
mask.” 

The Forest Goblin’s music be- 
came irritated, and he suddenly 
switched to his stimic. “He as- 
serts that I am an out-worlder? 
Let him prove his case, or he has 
my retaliation to face.” 

Kershaul glanced in embarrass- 



ment around the crowd which 
had gathered and once more 
struck up an ingratiating melody. 
“I am positive that Ser Moon- 
Moth — ” 

The Forest Goblin interrupted 
with a fanfare of skaranyi tones. 
“Let him demonstrate his case or 
prepare for the flow of blood.” 
Thissell said, “Very well, I’ll 
prove my case.” He stepped for- 
ward, grasped the Forest Goblin’s 
mask. “Let’s see your face, that’ll 
demonstrate your identity!” 

The Forest Goblin sprang back 
in amazement. The crowd gasped, 
then set up an ominous strum- 
ming and toning of various instru- 
ments. 

The Forest Goblin reached to 
the nape of his neck, jerked the 
cord to his duel-gong, and with 
his other hand snatched forth his 
scimitar. 

Kershaul stepped forward, 
playing the slobo with great agita- 
tion. Thissell, now abashed, 
moved aside, conscious of the 
ugly sound of the crowd. 

Kershaul sang explanations 
and apologies; the Forest Goblin 
answered; Kershaul spoke over 
his shoulder to Thissell: “Run for 
it, or you’ll be killed! Hurry!” 

r I ''HISSELL hesitated. The For- 
est Goblin put up his hand 
to thrust Kershaul aside. “Run!” 
screamed Kershaul. “To Welibus’s 
office. Lock yourself in!” 



THE MOON MOTH 



181 



Thissell took to his heels. The 
Forest Goblin pursued him a few 
yards, then stamped his feet and 
sent after him a set of raucous 
and derisive blasts of the hand- 
bugle, while the crowd produced a 
contemptuous counterpoint of 
clacking .hymerkins. 

There was no further pursuit. 

Instead of taking refuge in the 
Import-Export office, Thissell 
turned aside and after cautious 
reconnaissance proceeded to the 
dock where his houseboat was 
moored. 

The hour was not far short of 
dusk when he finally returned 
aboard. Toby and Rex squatted 
on the forward deck, surrounded 
by the provisions they had 
brought back; reed baskets of 
fruit and cereal, blue-glass jugs 
containing wine, oil and pungent 
sap, three young pigs in a wicker 
pen. They were cracking nuts be- 
tween their teeth and spitting 
the shells over the side. They 
looked up at Thissell, and it 
seemed that they rose to their 
feet with a new casualness. Toby 
muttered something under his 
breath; Rex smothered a chuckle. 

Thissell clacked his hymerkin 
angrily. He sang, “Take the boat 
off-shore; tonight we remain at 
Fan.” 

In the privacy of his cabin he 
removed the Moon-Moth and 
stared into a mirror at his almost 
unfamiliar features. He picked up 



the Moon-Moth, examined the 
detested lineaments: the furry 
gray skin, the blue spines, the 
ridiculous lace flaps. Har-dly a 
dignified presence for the Con- 
sular Representative of the Home 
Planets. If, in fact, he still held 
the position when Cromartin 
learned of Angmark’s winning 
free! 

Thissell flung himself into a 
chair and stared moodily into 
space. Today he’d suffered a series 
of setbacks. But he wasn’t de- 
feated yet, not by any means. 
Tomorrow he’d visit Mathew 
Kershaul; they’d discuss how best 
to locate Angmark. 

As Kershaul had pointed out, 
another out-world establishment 
could not be camouflaged. Haxo 
Angmark’s identity would soon 
become evident. Also, tomorrow 
he must procure another mask. 
Nothing extreme or vainglorious, 
but a mask which expressed a 
modicum of dignity and self-re- 
spect. 

At this moment one of the 
slaves tapped on the door-panel, 
and Thissell hastily pulled the 
hated Moon-Moth back over his 
head. 

IV 

E ARLY next morning, before 
the dawn-light had left the 
sky, the slaves sculled the house- 
boat back to that section of the 



182 



GALAXY 



dock set aside for the use of 
out-worlders. Neither Rolver nor 
Welibus nor Kershaul had yet 
arrived. Thissell waited impa- 
tiently. 

An hour passed, and Welibus 
brought his boat to the dock. Not 
wishing to speak to Welibus, 
Thissell remained inside his 
cabin. 

A few moments later Rolver’s 
boat likewise pulled in alongside 
the dock. Through the window 
Thissell saw Rolver, wearing his 
usual Tarn-Bird, climb to the 
dock. Here he was met by a man 
in a yellow-tufted Sand Tiger 
mask, who played a formal ac- 
companiment on his gomapard to 
whatever message he brought 
Rolver. 

Rolver seemed surprised and 
disturbed. After a moment’s 
thought he manipulated his own 
gomapard and, as he sang, he 
indicated Thissell’s houseboat. 
Then, bowing, he went on his 
way. 

The man in the Sand Tiger 
mask climbed with rather heavy 
dignity to the float and rapped 
on the bulwark of Thissell’s 
houseboat. 

Thissell presented himself. 
Sirenese etiquette did not demand 
that he invite a casual visitor 
aboard, so he merely struck an 
interrogation on his zachinko. 

The Sand Tiger played his 
gomapard and sang, “Dawn over 



the bay of Fan is customarily a 
splendid occasion. The sky is 
white with yellow and green 
colors. When Mireille rises, the 
mists burn and writhe like flames. 
He who sings derives a greater 
enjoyment from the hour when 
the floating corpse of an out- 
worlder does not appear to mar 
the serenity of the view.” 

Thissell’s zachinko gave off a 
startled interrogation almost of 
its own accord. The Sand Tiger 
bowed with dignity. “The singer 
acknowledges no peer in stead- 
fastness of disposition; however, 
he does not care to be plagued by 
the antics of a dissatisfied ghost. 
He therefore has ordered his 
slaves to attach a thong to the 
ankle of the corpse, and while we 
have conversed they have linked 
the corpse to the stern of your 
houseboat. You will wish to ad- 
minister whatever rites are pre- 
scribed in the out-world. He who 
sings wishes you a good morning 
and now departs.” 

Thissell rushed to the stern of 
his houseboat. There, near naked 
and maskless, floated the body of 
a mature man, supported by air 
trapped in his pantaloons. 

Thissell studied the dead face, 
which seemed characterless and 
vapid — perhaps in direct conse- 
quence of the mask-wearing habit. 
The body appeared of medium 
stature and weight. Thissell esti- 
mated the age as between forty- 



THE MOON MOTH 



183 



five and fifty. The hair was non- 
descript brown, the features 
bloated by the water. 

There was nothing to indicate 
how the man had died. 

This must be Haxo Angmark, 
thought Thissell. Who else could 
it be? Mathew Kershaul? Why 
not? Thissell asked himself un- 
easily. Rolver and Welibus had 
already disembarked and gone 
about their business. He searched 
across the bay to locate Kers- 
haul’s houseboat, and discovered 
it already tying up to the dock. 
Even as he watched Kershaul 
jumped ashore, wearing his Cave- 
Owl mask. 

He seemed in an abstracted 
mood, for he passed Thissell’s 
houseboat without lifting his eyes 
from the dock. 

Thissell turned back to the 
corpse: Angmark, then, beyond a 
doubt. Had not three men dis- 
embarked from the houseboats 
of Rolver, Welibus and Kershaul, 
wearing masks characteristic of 
these men? Obviously, the corpse 
of Angmark . The easy solu- 
tion refused to sit quiet in 
Thissell’s mind. Kershaul had 
pointed out that another out- 
worlder would be quickly identi- 
fied. How else could Angmark 
maintain himself? Unless . 
Thissell brushed the thought 
aside. The corpse was obviously 
Angmark. 

And yet . 



Thissell summoned his slaves, 
gave orders that a suitable con- 
tainer be brought to the dock, 
that the corpse be transferred 
therein, and conveyed to a suit- 
able place of repose. The slaves 
showed no enthusiasm for the 
task and Thissell was forced to 
thunder forcefully, if not skill- 
fully, on the hymerkin to empha- 
size his orders. 

He walked along the dock, 
turned up the esplanade, passed 
the office of Comely Welibus and 
set out along the pleasant little 
lane to the landing field. 

W HEN he arrived, he found 
that Rolver had not yet 
made an appearance. An over- 
slave, given status by a yellow 
rosette on his black cloth mask, 
asked how he might be of serv- 
ice. Thissell stated that he 
wished to dispatch a message to 
Polypolis. 

There was no difficulty here, 
declared the slave. If Thissell 
would set forth his message in 
clear block-print it would be 
despatched immediately. 

Thissell wrote: 

OUT-WORLDER FOUND 
DEAD, POSSIBLY ANGMARK. 
AGE 48, MEDIUM PHYSIQUE, 
BROWN HAIR. OTHER MEANS 
OF IDENTIFICATION LACK- 
ING. AWAIT ACKNOWLEDGE- 
MENT AND/OR INSTRUC- 
TIONS. 



184 



GALAXY 



He addressed the message to 
Castel Cromartin at Polypolis 
and handed it to the over-slave. 
A moment later he heard the 
characteristic sputter of trans- 
space discharge. 

An hour passed. Rolver made 
no appearance. 

Thissell paced restlessly back 
and forth in front of the office. 
There was no telling how long he 
would have to wait. Trans-space 
transmission time varied un- 
predictably. Sometimes the mes- 
sage snapped through in micro- 
seconds; sometimes it wandered 
through unknowable regions for 
hours; and there were several 
authenticated examples of mes- 
sages being received before they 
had been transmitted. 

Another half-hour passed, and 
Rolver finally arrived, wearing 
his customary Tarn-Bird. Coinci- 
dentally Thissell heard the hiss 
of the incoming message. 

Rolver seemed surprised to see 
Thissell. “What brings you out so 
early?” 

Thissell explained. “It con- 
cerns the body which you re- 
ferred to me this morning. I’m 
communicating with my supe- 
riors about it.” 

Rolver raised his head and 
listened to the sound of the in- 
coming message. “You seem to 
be getting an answer. I’d better 
attend to it.” 

“Why bother?” asked Thissell. 



“Your slave seems to be efficient.” 
“It’s my job,” declared Rolver. 
“I’m responsible for the accurate 
transmission and receipt of all 
space-grams.” 

“I’ll come with you,” said This- 
sell. “I’ve always wanted to watch 
the operation of the equipment.” 
“I’m afraid that’s irregular,” 
said Rolver. He went to the door 
which led into the inner com- 
partment. “I’ll have your mes- 
sage in a moment.” 

Thissell protested, but Rolver 
ignored him and went into the 
inner office. 

Five minutes later he reap- 
peared, carrying a small yellow 
envelope. “Not too good news,” 
he announced with unconvincing 
commiseration. 

Thissell glumly opened the en- 
velope. The message read: 

BODY NOT ANGMARK, 
ANGMARK HAS BLACK HAIR. 
WHY DID YOU NOT MEET 
LANDING? SERIOUS INFRAC- 
TION, HIGHLY DISSATISFIED. 
RETURN TO POLYPOLIS NEXT 
OPPORTUNITY. 

CASTEL CROMARTIN 

Thissell put the message in his 
pocket. “Incidentally, may I in- 
quire the color of your hair?” 
Rolver played a surprised little 
trill on his kiv. “I’m quite blond. 
Why do you ask?” 

“Mere curiosity.” 

Rolver played another rim on 
the kiv. “Now I understand. My 



THE MOON MOTH 



185 



dear fellow, what a suspicious 
nature you have! Look!” He 
turned and parted the folds of 
his mask at the nape of his neck. 
Thissell saw that Rolver was 
blond indeed. 

“Are you reassured?” asked 
Rolver jocularly. 

“Oh, indeed,” said Thissell. 
“Incidentally, have you another 
mask you could lend me? I’m sick 
of this Moon-Moth.” 

“I’m afraid not,” said Rolver. 
“But you need merely go into a 
mask-maker’s shop and make a 
selection.” 

“Yes, of course,” said Thissell. 
He took leave of Rolver and 
returned along the trail to Fan. 

13ASSING Welibus’ office he 
hesitated, then turned in. 
Today Welibus wore a dazzling 
confection of green glass prisms 
and silver beads, a mask This- 
sell had never seen before. 

Welibus greeted him cautiously 
to the accompaniment of a kiv. 
“Good morning, Ser Moon- 
Moth.” 

“I won’t take too much of your 
time,” said Thissell, “but I have 
a rather personal question to put 
to you. What color is your hair?” 

Welibus hesitated a fraction of 
a second, then turned his back, 
lifted the flap of his mask. This- 
sell saw heavy black ringlets. 
“Does that answer your ques- 
tion?” inquired Welibus. 



“Completely,” said Thissell. He 
crossed the esplanade, went out 
on the dock to Kershaul’s house- 
boat. Kershaul greeted him with- 
out enthusiasm, and invited him 
aboard with a resigned wave of 
the hand. 

“A question I’d like to ask,” 
said Thissell. “What color is your 
hair?” 

Kershaul laughed woefully. 
“What little remains is black. 
Why do you ask?” 

“Curiosity.” 

“Come, come,” said Kershaul 
with an unaccustomed bluffness. 
“There’s more to it than that.” 

Thissell, feeling the need of 
counsel, admitted as much. 
“Here’s the situation. A dead out- 
worlder was found in the harbor 
this morning. His hair was brown. 
I’m not entirely certain, but the 
chances are — let me see, yes, 
two out of three that Angmark’s 
hair is black.” 

Kershaul pulled at the Cave- 
Owl’s goatee. “How do you arrive 
at that probability?” 

“The information came to me 
through Rolver’s hands. He has 
blond hair. If Angmark has as- 
sumed Rolver’s identity, he would 
naturally alter the information 
which came to me this morning. 
Both you and Welibus admit to 
black hair.” 

“Hm,” said Kershaul. “Let me 
see if I follow your line of reason- 
ing. You feel that Haxo Angmark 



186 



GALAXY 



has killed either Rolver, Welibus 
or myself and assumed the dead 
man’s identity. Right?” 

Thissell looked at him in sur- 
prise. “You yourself emphasized 
that Angmark could not set up 
another out-world establishment 
without revealing himself! Don’t 
you remember?” 

“Oh, certainly. To continue. 
Rolver delivered a message to 
you stating that Angmark was 
dark, and announced himself to 
be blond.” 

“Yes. Can you verify this? I 
mean for the old Rolver?” 

“No,” said Kershaul sadly. 
“I’ve seen neither Rolver nor 
Welibus without their masks.” 

66TF Rolver is not Angmark,” 
Thissell mused, “if Angmark 
indeed has black hair, then both 
you and Welibus come under 
suspicion.” 

“Very interesting,” said Kers- 
haul. He examined Thissell 
warily. “For that matter, you 
yourself might be Angmark. What 
color is your hair?” 

“Brown,” said Thissell curtly. 
He lifted the gray fur of the 
Moon-Moth mask at the back of 
his head. 

“But you might be deceiving 
me as to the text of the message,” 
Kershaul put forward. 

“I’m not,” said Thissell wearily. 
“You can check with Rolver if 
you care to.” 



Kershaul shook his head. “Un- 
necessary. I believe you. But an- 
other matter: what of voices? 
You’ve heard all of us before and 
after Angmark arrived. Isn’t 
there some indication there?” 
“No. I’m so alert for any evi- 
dence of change that you all 
sound rather different. And the 
masks muffle your voices.” 

Kershaul tugged the goatee. 
“I don’t see any immediate solu- 
tion to the problem.” He chuckled. 
“In any event, need there be? 
Before Angmark’s advent, there 
were Rolver, Welibus, Kershaul 
and Thissell. Now — for all prac- 
tical purposes — there are still 
Rolver, Welibus, Kershaul and 
Thissell. Who is to say that the 
new member may not be an im- 
provement upon the old?” 

“An interesting thought,” 
agreed Thissell, “but it so hap- 
pens that I have a personal in- 
terest in identifying Angmark. My 
career is at stake.” 

“I see,” murmured Kershaul. 
“The situation then becomes an 
issue between yourself and Ang- 
mark.” 

“You won’t help me?” 

“Not actively. I’ve become per- 
vaded with Sirenese individual- 
ism. I think you’ll find that Rolver 
and Welibus will respond simi- 
larly.” He sighed. “All of us have 
been here too long.” 

Thissell stood deep in thought. 
Kershaul waited patiently a mo- 



THE MOON MOTH 



187 



ment, then said, “Do you have 
any further questions?” 

“No,” said Thissell. I have 
merely a favor to ask you. 

“I’ll oblige if I possibly can,” 
Kershaul replied courteously. 

“Give me, or lend me, one of 
your slaves, for a week or two.” 
Kershaul played an exclama- 
tion of amusement on the ganga. 
“I hardly like to part with my 
slaves. They know me and my 
ways — ” 

“As soon as I catch Angmark 
you’ll have him back.” 

“Very well,” said Kershaul. He 
rattled a summons on his hymer- 
kin, and a slave appeared. “An- 
thony,” sang Kershaul, “you are to 
go with Ser Thissell and serve 
him for a short period.” 

The slave bowed without pleas- 
ure. 

T HISSELL took Anthony to 
his houseboat, and questioned 
him at length, noting certain of 
the responses upon a chart. He 
then enjoined Anthony to say 
nothing of what had passed, and 
consigned him to the care of 
Toby and Rex. He gave further 
instructions to move the house- 
boat away from the dock and 
allow no one aboard until his re- 
turn. 

He set forth once more along 
the way to the landing field, and 
found Rolver at a lunch of spiced 
fish, shredded bark of the salad 



tree, and a bowl of native cur- 
rants. Rolver clapped an order 
on the hymerkin, and a slave set 
a place for Thissell. “And how are 
the investigations proceeding?” 
“I’d hardly like to claim any 
progress,” said Thissell. “I assume 
that I can count on your help?” 
Rolver laughed briefly. “You 
have my good wishes.” 

“More concretely,” said This- 
sell, “I’d like to borrow a slave 
from you. Temporarily.” 

Rolver paused in his eating. 
“Whatever for?” 

“I’d rather not explain,” said 
Thissell. “But you can be sure 
that I make no idle request.” 
Without graciousness Rolver 
summoned a slave and consigned 
him to Thissell’s service. 

On the way back to his house- 
boat, Thissell stopped at Welibus’ 
office. 

Welibus looked up from his 
work. “Good afternoon, Ser This- 
sell.” 

Thissell came directly to the 
point. “Ser Welibus, will you lend 
me a slave for a few days?” 
Welibus hesitated, then shrug- 
ged. “Why not?” He clacked his 
hymerkin; a slave appeared. “Is 
he satisfactory? Or would you 
prefer a young female?” He 
chuckled — rather offensively, to 
Thissell’s way of thinking. 

“He’ll do very well. I’ll return 
him in a few days.” 

“No hurry.” Welibus made an 



188 



GALAXY 



easy gesture and returned to his 
work. 

Thissell continued to his house- 
boat, where he separately in- 
terviewed each of his two new 
slaves and made notes upon his 
chart. 

Dusk came soft over the Ti- 
tanic Ocean. Toby and Rex 
sculled the houseboat away from 
the dock, out across the silken 
waters. Thissell sat on the deck 
listening to the sound of soft 
voices, the flutter and tinkle of 
musical instruments. Lights from 
the floating houseboats glowed 
yellow and wan watermelon-red. 
The shore was dark; the Night- 
men would presently come slink- 
ing to paw through refuse and 
stare jealously across the water. 

In nine days the Buenaventura 
came past Sirene on its regular 
schedule; Thissell had his orders 
to return to Polypolis. In nine 
days, could he locate Angmark? 

Nine days weren’t too many, 
Thissell decided, but they might 
possibly be enough. 

V 

^TWO days passed, and three 
and four and five. Every day 
Thissell went ashore and at least 
once a day visited Rolver, Weli- 
bus and Kershaul. 

Each reacted differently to his 
presence. Rolver was sardonic 
and irritable; Welibus formal and 



at least superficially affable; Kers- 
haul mild and suave, but ostenta- 
tiously impersonal and detached 
in his conversation. 

Thissell remained equally 
bland to Rolver’s dour jibes, Weli- 
bus’s jocundity, Kershaul’s with- 
drawal. And every day, returning 
to his houseboat, he made marks 
on his chart. 

The sixth, the seventh, the 
eighth day came and passed. Rol- 
ver, with rather brutal directness, 
inquired if Thissell wished to 
arrange for passage on the Buena- 
ventura. Thissell considered, and 
said, “Yes, you had better reserve 
passage for one.” 

“Back to the world of faces,” 
shuddered Rolver. “Faces! Every- 
where pallid, fish-eyed faces. 
Mouths like pulp, noses knotted 
and punctured; flat flabby faces. 
I don’t think I could stand it after 
living here. Luckily you haven’t 
become a real Sirenese.” 

“But I won’t be going back,” 
said Thissell. 

“I thought you wanted me to 
reserve passage.” 

“I do — for Haxo Angmark. 
He’ll be returning to Polypolis, 
in the brig.” 

“Well, well,” said Rolver. “So 
you’ve picked him out.” 

“Of course,” said Thissell. 
“Haven’t you?” 

Rolver shrugged. “He’s either 
Welibus or Kershaul, that’s as 
close as I can make it. So long 



THE MOON MOTH

as he wears his mask and calls 
himself either Welibus or Kers- 
haul, it means nothing to me.” 

“It means a great deal to me,” 
said Thissell. “What time tomor- 
row does the lighter go up?” 
“Eleven twenty-two sharp. If 
Haxo Angmark’s leaving, tell him 
to be on time.” 

“He’ll be here,” said Thissell. 
He made his usual call upon 
Welibus and Kershaul. Then, re- 
turning to his houseboat, he put 
three final marks on his chart. 

The evidence was here, plain 
and convincing. Not absolutely 
incontrovertible evidence, but 
enough to warrant a definite 
move. He checked over his gun. 
Tomorrow was the day of deci- 
sion. He could afford no errors. 

'T'HE day dawned bright white, 
the sky like the inside of an 
oyster shell. Mireille rose through 
iridescent mists. Toby and Rex 
sculled the houseboat to the dock. 
The remaining three out-world 
houseboats floated somnolently 
on the slow swells. 

One boat Thissell watched in 
particular, that whose owner 
Haxo Angmark had killed and 
dropped into the harbor. This 
boat presently moved toward the 
shore, and Haxo Angmark him- 
self stood on the front deck, 
wearing a mask Thissell had 
never seen before: a construction 
of scarlet feathers, black glass 



and spiked green hair. It was 
most impressive. 

Thissell was forced to admire 
his poise. A clever scheme, clev- 
erly planned and executed — 
but marred by an insurmountable 
difficulty. 

Angmark returned within. The 
houseboat reached the dock. 
Slaves flung out mooring lines 
and lowered the gangplank. This- 
sell, his gun ready in the pocket 
flap of his robes, walked down 
the dock, went aboard. He pushed 
open the door to the saloon. The 
man at the table raised his red, 
black and green mask in sur- 
prise. 

Thissell said, “Angmark, please 
don’t argue or make any — ” 

Something hard and heavy 
tackled him from behind; he was 
flung to the floor, his gun wrested 
expertly away. 

Behind him the hymerkin 
clattered; a voice sang, “Bind the 
fool’s arms.” 

The man sitting at the table 
rose to his feet, removed the red, 
black and green mask to reveal 
the black cloth of a slave. This- 
sell twisted his head. Over him 
stood Haxo Angmark, wearing a 
mask Thissell recognized as a 
Dragon-Tamer, fabricated from 
black metal, with a knife-blade 
nose, socketed eyelids, and three 
crests running back over the 
scalp. 

The mask’s expression was un- 



190 



GALAXY 



readable, but Angmark’s voice 
was triumphant. “I trapped you 
very easily.” 

“So you did,” said Thissell. 
The slave finished knotting his 
wrists together. A clatter of Ang- 
mark’s hymerkin sent him away. 
“Get to your feet,” said Angmark. 
“Sit in that chair.” 

“What are we waiting for?” 
inquired Thissell. 

“Two of our fellows still re- 
main out on the water. We won’t 
need them for what I have in 
mind.” 

“Which is?” 

“You’ll learn in due course,” 
said Angmark. “We have an hour 
or so on our hands.” 

Thissell tested his bonds. They 
were undoubtedly secure. 

A NGMARK seated himself. 
■‘•■“How did you fix on me? I 
admit to being curious . Come, 
come,” he chided as Thissell sat 
silently. “Can’t you recognize that 
I have defeated you? Don’t make 
affairs unpleasant for yourself.” 
Thissell shrugged. “I operated 
on a basic principle. A man can 
mask his face, but he can’t mask 
his personality.” 

“Aha,” said Angmark. “Interest- 
ing. Proceed.” 

“I borrowed a slave from you 
and the other two out-worlders, 
and I questioned them carefully. 
What masks had their masters 
worn during the month before 



your arrival? I prepared a chart 
and plotted their responses. 
Rolver wore the Tarn Bird about 
eighty percent of the time, the 
remaining twenty percent divided 
between the Sophist Abstraction 
and the Black Intricate. Welibus 
had a taste for the heroes of 
Kan-Dachan Cycle. He wore the 
Chalekun, the Prince Intrepid, 
the Seavain most of the time: 
six days out of eight. The other 
two days he wore his South-Wind 
or his Gay Companion. Kershaul, 
more conservative, preferred the 
Cave-Owl, the Star Wanderer, 
and two or three other masks he 
wore at odd intervals. 

“As I say, I acquired this in- 
formation from possibly its most 
accurate source, the slaves. My 
next step was to keep watch upon 
the three of you. Every day I 
noted what masks you wore and 
compared it with my chart. 
Rolver wore his Tarn-Bird six 
times, his Black Intricate twice. 
Kershaul wore his Cave-Owl five 
times, his Star Wanderer once, 
his Quincunx once and his Ideal 
of Perfection once. Welibus wore 
the Emerald Mountain twice, the 
Triple Phoenix three times, the 
Prince Intrepid once and the 
Shark-God twice.” 

Angmark nodded thoughtfully. 
“I see my error. I selected from 
Welibus’s mask, but to my own 
taste — and, as you point out, 
I revealed myself. But only to 



THE MOON MOTH 



191 



you.” He rose and went to the 
window. “Kershaul and Rolver 
are now coming ashore. They’ll 
soon be past and about their busi- 
ness — though I doubt if they’d 
interfere in any case. They’ve 
both become good Sirenese.” 

Thissell waited in silence. Ten 
minutes passed. Then Angmark 
reached to a shelf and picked up 
a knife. He looked at Thissell. 
“Stand up.” 

Thissell slowly rose to his feet. 
Angmark approached from the 
side, reached out, lifted the Moon- 
Moth from Thissell’s head. This- 
sell gasped and made a vain 
attempt to seize it. Too late; his 
face was bare and naked. 

A NGMARK turned away, re- 
moved his own mask, donned 
the Moon-Moth. He struck a call 
on his hymerkirt. Two slaves en- 
tered, stopped in shock at the 
sight of Thissell. 

Angmark played a brisk tattoo, 
sang, “Carry this man up to the 
dock.” 

“Angmark,” cried Thissell. “I’m 
maskless!” 

The slaves seized him and, in 
spite of Thissell’s desperate strug- 
gles, conveyed him out on the 
deck, along the float and up on 
the dock. 

Angmark fixed a rope around 
Thissell’s neck. He said, “You are 
now Haxo Angmark, and I am 
Edwer Thissell. Welibus is dead. 



Y ou shall soon be dead. I can 
handle your job without difficulty. 
I’ll play musical instruments like 
a Night-man and sing like a crow. 
I’ll wear the Moon-Moth till it 
rots and then I’ll get another. The 
report will go to Polypolis, Haxo 
Angmark is dead. Everything will 
be serene.” 

Thissell barely heard. “You 
can’t do this,” he whispered. “My 
mask, my face ...” A large woman 
in a blue and pink flower mask 
walked down the dock. She saw 
Thissell and, emitting a piercing 
shriek, flung herself prone on the 
dock. 

“Come along,” said Angmark 
brightly. He tugged at the rope 
and pulled Thissell down the 
dock. A man in a Pirate Cap- 
tain mask coming up from his 
houseboat stood rigid in amaze- 
ment. 

Angmark played the zachinko 
and sang, “Behold the notorious 
criminal Haxo Angmark. Through 
all the outer-worlds his name is 
reviled. Now he is captured and 
led in shame to his death. Be- 
hold Haxo Angmark!” 

They turned into the espla- 
nade. A child screamed in fright. 
A man called hoarsely. Thissell 
stumbled; tears tumbled from his 
eyes; he could see only disor- 
ganized shapes and colors. Ang- 
mark’s voice belled out richly: 
“Everyone behold the criminal of 
the out-worlds, Haxo Angmark! 



192 



GALAXY 



Approach and observe his execu- 
tion!” 

Thissell feebly cried out, “I’m 
not Angmark. I’m Edwer This- 
sell; he’s Angmark.” But no one 
listened to him. There were only 
cries of dismay, shock, disgust at 
the sight of his face. He called to 
Angmark, “Give me my mask, a 
slave-cloth . .” 

Angmark sang jubilantly. “In 
shame he lived, in maskless 
shame he dies.” 

A Forest Goblin .stood before 
Angmark. “Moon-Moth, we meet 
once more.” 

Angmark sang, “Stand aside, 
friend Goblin. I must execute this 
criminal. In shame he lived, in 
shame he dies!” 

A crowd had formed around 
the group; masks stared in mor- 
bid titillation at Thissell. 

The Forest Goblin jerked the 
rope from Angmark’s hand and 
threw it to the ground. The crowd 
roared. Voices cried, “No duel, no 
duel! Execute the monster!” 



A CLOTH was thrown over 
Thissell’s head. Thissell 
awaited the thrust of a blade. 
But instead his bonds were cut. 
Hastily he adjusted the cloth, 
hiding his face, peering between 
the folds. 

Four men clutched Haxo Ang- 
mark. The Forest Goblin con- 
fronted him, playing the skaranyi. 
“A week ago you reached to di- 



vest me of my mask. You have 
now achieved your perverse aim!” 
“But he is a criminal,” cried 
Angmark. “He is notorious, in- 
famous!” 

“What are his misdeeds?” sang 
the Forest Goblin. 

“He has murdered, betrayed; he 
has wrecked ships; he has tor- 
tured, blackmailed, robbed, sold 
children into slavery; he has — ” 
The Forest Goblin stopped 
him. “Your religious convictions 
are of no importance. We can 
vouch however for your present 
crimes!” 

The hostler stepped forward. 
He sang fiercely, “This insolent 
Moon-Moth nine days ago sought 
to pre-empt my choicest mount!” 
Another man pushed close. He 
wore a Universal Expert, and 
sang, “I am a Master Mask-mak- 
er; I recognize this Moon-Moth 
out-worlder! Only recently he 
entered my shop and derided my 
skill. He deserves death!” 

“Death to the out-world mon- 
ster!” cried the crowd. A wave 
of men surged forward. 

Steel blades rose and fell. The 
deed was done. 

Thissell watched, unable to 
move. The Forest Goblin ap- 
proached, and playing the stimic 
sang sternly, “For you we have 
pity, but also contempt. A true 
man would never suffer such in- 
dignities!” 

Thissell took a deep breath. He

reached to his belt and found his 
zachinko. He sang, “My friend, 
you malign me! Can you not ap- 
preciate true courage? Would you 
prefer to die in combat or walk 
maskless along the esplanade?” 
The Forest Goblin sang, 
“There is only one answer. First 
I would die in combat; I could 
not bear such shame.” 

Thissell sang, “I had such a 
choice. I could fight with my 
hands tied, and so die — or I 
could suffer shame, and through 
this shame conquer my enemy. 
You admit that you lack suffici- 
ent strakh to achieve this deed. 
I have proved myself a hero of 
bravery! I ask, who here has 
courage to do what I have done?” 
“Courage?” demanded the For- 
est Goblin. “I fear nothing, up to 
and beyond death at the hands of 
the Night-men!” 

“Then answer.” 

r T'HE Forest Goblin stood back. 

He played his double-kam- 
anthil. “Bravery indeed, if such 
were your motives.” 

The hostler struck a series of 
subdued gomapard chords and 
sang, “Not a man among us would 
dare what this maskless man has 
done.” 

The crowd muttered approval. 



The mask-maker approached 
Thissell, obsequiously stroking 
his double-kamanthil. “Pray, 
Lord Hero, step into my nearby 
shop, exchange this vile rag for 
a mask befitting your quality.” 
Another mask-maker sang, 
“Before you choose, Lord Hero, 
examine my magnificent crea- 
tions!” 

A man in a Bright Sky Bird 
mask approached Thissell rever- 
ently. “I have only just completed 
a sumptuous houseboat; seven- 
teen years of toil have gone into 
its fabrication. Grant me the good 
fortune of accepting and using 
this splendid craft. Aboard wait- 
ing to serve you are alert slaves 
and pleasant maidens; there is 
ample wine in storage and soft 
silken carpets on the decks.” 
“Thank you,” said Thissell, 
striking the zachinko with vigor 
and confidence. “I accept with 
pleasure. But first a mask.” 

The mask-maker struck an in- 
terrogative trill on the gomapard. 
“Would the Lord Hero consider 
a Sea-Dragon Conqueror beneath 
his dignity?” 

“By no means,” sang Thissell. 
“I consider it suitable and satis- 
factory. We shall go now to ex- 
atnine it.”
