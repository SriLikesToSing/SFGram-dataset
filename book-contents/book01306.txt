66 What You Do Once — 99 



When we were first hooked on 
science fiction, quite some time ago, 
one of our favorite stories was Doc 
Smith’s Skylark Three, and one of 
our favorite scenes occurred when 
young Dick Seaton, studying under 
the wise old masters of the planet 
Norlamin, was working with Rovol 
of Rays at a tremendous technical 
project. Side by side they construct- 
ed new instrument consoles, their 
fingers flying: 

Rovol’s fingers were also flying, 
but the forces he directed were 
seizing and shaping materials, as well 
as other forces. The Norlaminian 
physicist set up one integral, stepped 
upon a pedal, and a new red-topped 
stop precisely like the others, and 
numbered in order, appeared as 
though by magic upon the panel. 
Rovol then leaned back in his seat 
— but the red-topped stops con- 
tinued to. appear, at the rate of ex- 
actly seventy per minute . “Never 
forget that R is a waste of energy 
to do the same thing twice, and that 
if you know precisely what is to be 
done, you need not do it personally 
at all.” 

Well, that was a long time ago. 



But we were reminded of it twice 
this month. 

One reason was simply that our 
next serial, of course, is that same 
Doc Smith's latest and biggest Sky- 
lark story, Skylark DuQuesne. The 
other reason was a letter from the 
sf club at MIT. 

Remember last month we were 
talking about the things fans do? — 
including the preparation of biblio- 
graphical material and indexes? Well, 
up at MIT they’ve brought the old 
reliable Don Day index of sf maga- 
zines up to date. (You can get it 
from the MIT Science Fiction Soci- 
ety, Room 50-020, 77 Massachusetts 
Avenue, Cambridge, Mass., by the 
way. $2.) But they haven’t merely 
published it. They’ve computerized 
it. All the data is now on punched 
cards, and the machines at the MIT 
Computation Center are printing it 
out in the form of mimeograph 
stencils. Comes time for a new edi- 
tion? Why just put in your additional 
cards — and the machine will print 
out your revision. 

“Never forget that it is a waste 
of energy to do the same thing twice 
. and that if you know precisely 
what is to be done, you need not do 
it personally at all!”-THE EDITOR

THE ALTAR 

by JOHN BRUNNER 

AT ASCOHEl 



Illustrated by MORROW 



The civilization of the stars was dissolving 
like a dream — and its terrible chaos drew 
Spartak into the violence he had foreswornl 



I 

A t last, after almost ten years, 
the moment had come. He felt 
himself ready for the task he had 
undertaken. 

Spartak of Asconel closed the 



latest of hundreds of books which 
he had consulted, drew a deep 
breath and gazed around his cell. 
Other books were piled high on 
every shelf. Beside them were tape, 
crystal and disk recordings, reels of 
microfilm, manuscripts — the win- 



6 




nowings of a decade-long search 
through the unparalleled store of 
knowledge here on Annanworld. 

The switch from student to teach- 
er was as easy as picking up the 
microphone of his own recorder 
and uttering the first words. His 
hand closed on the microphone as 
though seizing a noxious plant, that 
must be gripped firmly to prevent 
it stinging, and he began to speak 
in a measured voice. 

“The story of the Empire,” he 
commenced, and heard in imagina- 
tion the crashing of worlds like 
bowling-balls being hurled down a 
skittle-alley, “is shrouded in mystery. 
Ten thousand years have eroded his- 
tory away. 

“We know that we were borrow- 
ers. We inherited the abandoned 
property — most significantly, the 
interstellar ships — of a people that 
matured and died in the galactic hub 
while we were struggling outward 
from our legendary planet of origin. 
We know that this chance bequest 
allowed our race to spread among 
millions of stars like an epidemic. 

“Details beyond this bare outline, 
however, can never be reclaimed. 
It is as though one were to blink 
and find a century had passed. 
Blink now, and man is creeping 
along the galactic rim, in those areas 
which were later to be regarded 
as the home of mutants and pirates. 
Blink once more, and the Empire’s 
writ runs all the way to the threshold 
of the Big Dark.” 

N ow he was warming to his tale, 
the greatest in the chequered 
span of human history. His hooded 



eyes saw other sights than the plain 
stone walls of the tiny room. The 
note of uncertainty was fading from 
his voice. 

He was scarcely aware of the 
opening of his door, and did not 
turn to look at the gray-clad no- 
vice who had appeared in the en- 
trance. 

“Yet,” he continued, “something 
strained past its limit. Something 
was overburdened, and broke. And 
the Empire fell.” 

The novice, impatient perhaps, 
moved from one foot to the other; 
the disturbance caught a fragment 
of Spartak’s attention. 

He put aside the microphone, and 
the hum of the recorder died. Shift- 
ing his lanky body in its coarse 
brown robe to face the intruder, he 
asked a question with his eyes. 

“I’m sorry. Brother Spartak,” the 
voice said. “Brother Ulwyn sent me 
with a message from the gatehouse. 
There is a man demanding to see 
you who claims to be your brother.” 
Spartak repressed an exclamation 
of astonishment and put his hand to 
his crisp brown beard. He said, “Ah 
— well, it’s not impossible. I have 
brothers, though I never expected to 
see one of them on Annanworld . 
What’s his name?” 

The novice looked unhappy, and 
shuffled his sandal-clad feet on the 
stone flags. He said, “I’m afraid 
Brother Ulwyn didn’t tell me.” 
“What does he look like? Did you 
see him?” 

“I caught a glimpse of him 
through the bars of the gate. He’s — 
well, not as tall as you are, and he 
has red hair. And there’s a long scar 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



T 




down his right cheek, which looks 
like a sword-cut.” The novice added 
the final detail eagerly. 

“That’s not very helpful. All three 
of my brothers have red hair and all 
are shorter than I am. And last time 
I saw them none had a sword-scar!” 
“He bears no resemblance to you 
that I could tell,” the novice sug- 
gested after a pause. 

“That’s no help either,” Spartak 
grunted. “I call them my brothers, 
but in fact we’re half-brothers, only. 
Well, it can hardly be Hodat, who 
rules on Asconel, so it must be either 
Vix or Tiorin. Send him in!” 
“Unfortunately — ” The novice 
swallowed in enormous embarrass- 
ment. “Unfortunately Brother Ulwyn 
cannot admit him. He carries a gun, 
and will not part with it.” 

In spite of his oath of allegiance 
to his non-violent Order, Spartak 
felt he was beginning to grin. “It 
sounds like Vix,” he said gravely. 
“Tell me, has he already threatened 
to burn his way in if the gate isn’t 
opened?” 

“I — I imagine so, from Brother 
Ulwyn’s agitation,” the novice con- 
firmed, and ventured a shy smile. 

“That’ll be Vix,” Spartak mur- 
mured, and got to his feet. “Let’s 
find out what he wants.” 

II 

T hey passed through twilit pas- 
sages, cool for all the baking 
heat of noon outdoors, and walked 
the length of the gravel paths be- 
tween the crisp green lawns, the low 
trees and beads of carefully tended 
flowers. Here and there, groups of 



gray-clad novices — with among them 
an occasional off-world student in 
gaudier clothing — gathered about 
their brown-robed tutors, discussing 
knotty points of human history. 

Spartak quickened his stride till 
the novice was scuttling to keep up. 
After all, the appearance of a broth- 
er he hadn’t seen in a decade was an 
event. 

At the threshold of the gatehouse 
Brother Ulwyn came to meet them. 
That was an event, too; the gate- 
keeper was stout, elderly and usually 
imperturbable. Now his round face 
was sweat-shiny and his voice 
wheezed with agitation. 

“That ruffianl” he exploded. “He 
carries arms all about him! He of- 
fered violence to me! And on An- 
nanworld! You must calm him, Spar- 
tak, and persuade him to enter. Al- 
ready there’s a jeering crowd from 
the village beyond the gate, and 
more are gathering all the time.” 

“Let me through, and I’ll talk 
with him,” Spartak said. 

“But calm him, and bring him 
in,” Brother Ulwyn stressed, reach- 
ing for the bunch of keys that swung 
at his girdle. “Do you know, I think 
if the peephole had been larger he’d 
have dragged me through it?” 

Moments later Spartak emerged 
on to the dusty roadway that led up 
from the village in the valley a short 
walk distant. As Ulwyn had said, a 
crowd had gathered on the other 
side of the road, grinning and chat- 
tering. A few paces away from them, 
sitting on a milestone and looking 
thunderously angry, was Vix, the 
sword-scar about which the novice 
had spoken milk-white on his rage-

red cheek. It was small wonder that 
Uhvyn had been agitated; across his 
back Vix wore an energy gun which 
would probably have been capable of 
razing the gatehouse with a single 
boh. 

Spartak threw his hood back on 
his shoulders. Vix stood up. He 
spoke his brother’s name in a 
strange, uncertain voice: “Spartak?” 
“Yes, it’s L Though the beard 
is new to my face since last we met.” 
All the fury, and with it all the 
spirit, seemed to drain out of Vix in 
an instant. “So it’s true,” he said 
wearily, and spat in the dust. 

P uzzled, the gaping countryfolk 
fell silent, apart from one who 
laughed. But he too was silent the 
moment after Vix had scythed at 
him with a murderous glare. 

“Vix!” Spartak cried, and lost the 
self control which ten years on An- 
nanworld had ingrained in him. He 
caught up his robe and closed the 
distance between himself and his 
half-brother in a dozen loping strides, 
the loose soles of his sandals slap- 
ping up little clouds of yellow dust. 
“Was that why you came to seek 
me out?” 

Vix set his hands squarely on his 
hips. He had to throw back his head 
to look directly into the younger 
man’s eyes. He was head and shoul- 
ders shorter of the two, but made up 
in muscles like steel springs. 

“Hodat is dead. Murdered,” Vix 
cried. “And a usurper has made him- 
self Warden. And he has brought a 
foul cult from no one knows where, 
and his evil priests lord it over the 
citizens of Asconel!” 



“But — when? How?” Spartak 
clutched at the other’s arm, a torrent 
of questions rising in his mind. 

“The news was already stale 
when it reached me on Batyra Dap. 
My first thought was to raise forces 
and liberate the planet, but it costs 
hard cash to hire an army, and I’ve 
— not been so lucky as I hoped.” A 
grim sardonic twist drew up half 
his mouth; the sword-slash seemed 
to have paralyzed the other side of 
his lips. “And anyway, by this time 
Bucyon — that’s his n&me, mark it 
well — has by all reports made a 
cringing pack of dogs of our once- 
proud people.” 

Abruptly aware of where they 
stood on the hot dry road, Spartak 
said, “Come inside. Take refresh- 
ment and tell me there.” 

“They won’t let me in,” Vix 
grunted. 

“Not you — the weapons you wear. 
We’re an Order sworn to absolute 
non-violence; no knife, sword or gun 
is permitted insiue the gate. But you 
may safely leave your weapons with 
Brother Ulwyn, and collect them on 
departure.” 

“Much help you’ll he,” Vix sighed. 
“To think I came so far, and find 
you bound by an oath to abjure 
violence — when that’s what it’ll take 
to set our homeland free!!” 

Ill 

U A fine comfortable backwater 
you picked yourself!” Vix ex- 
ploded. 

He was in a padded chair in the 
anteroom of the refectory. The order 
to which Spartak had pledged him-

IF 




seif bad a tradition of hospitality to 
travelers, and it had only taken a 
word about Vix’s journey to the 
chief steward to produce a meal of 
cold meats, bread and fruit such as 
the Warden hhnself on Asconel 
would have been proud to present. 
Also there was wine aplenty, though 
not stronger drink nor any of the 
Imperial euphorics like ancinard. 
The rules of the foundation decreed 
a clear head. 

Vix drained his wine-mug and of- 
fered it for replenishment to the 
gray-robed novice waiting on them. 

“By the stars, I haven’t had a meal 
like this in five years! And to think 
I was fool enough to pick a fighting 
order for myself!” 

Startled, Spartak blinked at him. 
“You joined an order too?” 

Mouth full, Vix nodded. “I took 
service with one of the rump forces 
left over from the Imperial collapse, 
full of bigheaded ideas about re- 
imposing galactic rule on the rebel- 
lious worlds. But it’s all comet-dust. 
I’ve slept on the bare ground as often 
as not, drunk dirty water till the 
medics had to stiok me full of 
needles and bathe me in rays, col- 
lected this scar and others which I 
can’t show in polite company . 
Ah, but it hasn’t all been so bad. 
I’ve enjoyed myself in my own fash- 
ion, for if I hadn’t I’d have dug 
myself a piece of mud somewhere 
and planted corn.” 

He swallowed the last of his food, 
leaned back in his chair, and burped 
enormously. Wiping his mouth with 
the back of his hand, he stared at 
Spartak. 

“You’re waiting there very calm 



and smug, aren’t you?” he accused. 
“I thought you’d ply me with ques- 
tions all the time I was eating!” 

“I was sure you’d tell me in your 
own good time,” Spartak answered 
peaceably. He was going to have to 
tread very carefully in his dealings 
with this irascible older brother, that 
was plain. “In any case, the shock 
of hearing Hod at was dead seems to 
have — ” he made a vague gesture — 
“chilled my mind, so to speak. I can 
hardly credit it.” 

“Ah, you always were a corked 
bottle. Ashamed to show your feel- 
ings in front of anyone else. If you 
have any feelings, that is.” With the 
solid food in his guts, Vix was re- 
verting to his normal manner. 

Spartak flushed. “I’m sorry. It’s 
true I’ve spent more time reading 
than talking these past several years. 
But it’s in a good cause,” he added 
defensively, thinking to penetrate 
the other’s hostility. “I’m working 
on a history of Asconel.” 

“Faugh! I’m not concerned with 
the dead past. I’m worried about the 
future. Don’t your books tell you 
that that’s under our control, while 
the past is what we find it and we 
can’t set it to rights?” Another gulp 
of wine, and once more the mug held 
out for refilling. “Besides, I don’t 
much hold with working at a dis- 
tance. Asconel is its own history.” 

“I — ” On the verge of a hot ob- 
jection, Spartak checked. “I’ll tell 
you something, too,” he continued 
after a moment’s pause. “That’s a 
far more philosophical remark than 
I ever expected to hear from your 
lips!” 

“By the nine moons of Argus, if 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



11 




you can’t learn something in ten 
years’ travelling, you might as well 
be dead.” Vix put his hand to his 
waist, as though uncomfortable at 
the absence of his sidearms. “And 
I’m not dead. Well, let’s not bicker. 
I’ll tell you what I can.” 

Spartak bit back a retort. He was 
now absorbing the important points 
of what Vix had told him: Hodat 
dead, a usurper ruling Asconel, some 
cult with an arrogant priesthood 
dominating the citizens. All this add- 
ed up to a frightening whole. 

V ix said: “This woman Lydis 
appeared one day, off a ship 
from no one knows where. Some- 
how, she got herself to the attention 
of Hodat, and once they’d met, 
things went out of control. He said, 
so the story runs, that this woman 
knew his innermost thoughts — that 
she was like a part of himself. Be- 
fore anyone knew what had hap- 
pened, she was being talked of as 
his wife-to-be. 

“True, for a while things went 
well enough, I’m told. The witch 
Lydis was said to be beautiful, which 
is a good start for any woman, al- 
though she never appeared in public 
except in a long black gown with a 
veil over her hair. Like Borin fore- 
saw, there was a plot to depose 
Hodat because of some degree or 
other, and allegedly she warned him 
of it, having seen into the minds of 
those, who planned it.” 

“A telepathic mutant,” Spartak 
muttered. 

“Then the priests of Belizuek 
started to come in. It had always 
been Imperial policy that if any- 



one was fool enough to want to 
spend time talking to idols or the 
empty air they should be allowed to 
get on with it, so under the guise 
of religious freedom they were per- 
mitted to land. Hodat started listen- 
ing to them a great deal. I ought to 
say this was some cult to which Ly- 
dis herself adhered, by the way — 
said it was from her home world of 
Brinze. 

“I guess it was the sacrifices 
which sparked the last resistance in 
Hodat. Bemused though he was by 
the witch, he yet had enough love 
for Asconel and its people to refuse 
that horrible last step.” 

“Sacrifices?” Spartak heard his 
own voice utter the word an infinite- 
ly long way away. “Not — human 
sacrifices?” 

“Human,” Vix echoed, and the 
word seemed to curdle the air of the 
room. “And it was then, while Hodat 
yet refused, that Bucyon came from 
space with a fleet the equal of the 
one I used to fight with over by Baty- 
ra Dap — ex-Imperial ships. 

“They took over. They killed 
Hodat. And Bucyon sits in the War- 
den’s chair with Lydis at his side — 
she having been the bait dangled 
ahead of Hodat to lead him to dis- 
aster. And Asconel is a ruin of all 
our father’s hopes.” 

“Is there no resistance to the us- 
urper?” Spartak whispered. 

“Some, some. I hear that Tigrid 
Zen — remember him? — is either in 
exile or in hiding on one of the outer 
planets of the home system, trying 
to find an opening in the net Buc- 
yon has cast around Asconel. But 
there’s no spirit in the people.”

IF 




Spartak got blindly to his feet. He 
said, “I — I must go and speak to 
Father Erton, and tell him I’m called 
away. And then I’ll fetch my belong- 
ings and come with you.” 

“Well!” Vix studied him. “That’s 
more like the response I’d hoped 
for, late though it is. But I warn you, 
I can’t tote all your beloved books 
and such around the galaxy! I’ve 
grown used to travelling light in 
these past ten years.” 

“My books are in my head,” Spar- 
tak said quietly, and went out. 

IV 

O ut in the corridor, Spartak 
paused as he snapped his fingers 
at a passing novice: Inform Father 
Erton I wish to see him, collect my 
belongings and pack them in my 
cases, have the kitchener prepare two 
travelpacks of food . 

Then Spartak headed straight to- 
ward the library. 

He entered the enormous hall with 
sufficient lack of the proper cere- 
mony to draw a reproving glare from 
the Head Librarian, Brother Carl, 
in his high pulpit overlooking the 
entire array of more than five hun- 
dred low-walled cubicles. But he 
barely noticed that; he was con- 
cerned only to spot a vacant cubicle 
on the master plan-board and make 
his way to it as quickly as possible. 

There was a place unoccupied at 
Aisle II, Rank Five. He almost broke 
into a run as he approached it. 
Without bothering to close the door 
behind him he dropped into the 
single chair and punched a rapid 
succession of buttons on the panel 



which formed the only other fea- 
ture of the tiny booth. One finger 
poised to stab the PRESENTATION 
button, he hesitated; then he decid- 
ed it was best to have a permanent 
record, and run the risk of the 
knowledgeable library computers 
swamping him with a flood of lit- 
erature. He punched for a print-out 
instead of spoken or screened data. 

Then he took a deep breath. 
“Brinze,” he said. “Planet, presumed 
habitable, location unknown.” 

He waited in a mood of grim ex- 
pectancy. It was all very well for 
Port Controller Grydnik, out on As- 
conel — which was, after all, rather 
an isolated world — to state that 
Brinze didn’t exist because there was 
no Imperial record of it. But the 
records of Annanworld weren’t so 
parochial. 

The library disgorged a small plain 
card, no larger than the palm of his 
hand, from the slot at the base of 
the panel. Dismayed, Spartak picked 
it up and read it. It ran: 

“BRINZE, planet presumed hab- 
itable, location unknown. No data. 
Request verify basis for question.” 
He tore the card across and threw 
it away. “Belizuek,” he said. “Re- 
ligious cult or feature of cult.” 

The answering card was slightly 
larger, but not much. On it were the 
words: “BELIZUEK, title and ob- 
ject of veneration of religious cult 
introduced to former Imperial space 
at ASCONEL (q.v.) approximately 
four years ago. No data on origins. 
No data on ritual. Unconfirmed re- 
ports of human sacrifice posted as 
IMPROBABLE.” 

“Bucyon,” Spartak said. “Per- 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

sonal name. Lydis, personal name.” 
Deliberately he refrained from cross- 
referencing to Asconel. The fact 
that the library contained informa- 
tion even as meagre as what it had 
given him on this mysterious Beli- 
zuek cult had taken him aback; he 
had imagined that in his ten-year 
research for his projected history of 
his home planet he had exhausted 
every single reference in the entire 
store. 

“BUCYON,” the third card said. 
“Present Warden of Asconel. LY- 
DIS, present consort of Bucyon. Un- 
confirmed reports of usurpation by 
violence posted as — ” 

He didn’t bother to see under what 
delicate category the memory of the 
library had entered those reports. He 
crumpled the card and tossed it aside 
in fury. 

“I’m an idiot,” he growled. 

This material the library was sup- 
plying to him was nothing more than 
the siftings of the story Vix himself 
had just told in the refactory ante- 
room. Brother Ulwyn, in the gate- 
house, must have informed the 
library as a matter of routine that 
a visitor from Asconel had arrived, 
and the library, finding it lacked re- 
cent news of that planet, had auto- 
matically eavesdropped on this 
much-travelled stranger. Techniques 
like these had been partially respon- 
sible for making Annanworld into 
the most notable of all the Empire’s 
information centres. 

For some minutes after that, he 
just sat. He had hoped to present a 
whole stack of data about Brinze 
and Belizuek to Vix, as some sort 
of justification for having hidden 



away in this placid backwater. Vix’s 
gibe was half-true, he had to admit. 
And it turned out there was nothing 
in the library but the same rumors, 
now rendered third-hand. 

The door of the cubicle was 
pushed aside, and a startled offworld 
student was there, carrying a record- 
er. “Oh! Excuse me, Brother, but 
this cubicle was shown vacant on — ” 

“That’s all right,” Spartak said, 
rising with limbs that seemed to 
have stiffened from the passage of 
a lifetime. “I forgot to shut the 
door. But I’ve done what I came to 
do, anyway.” 

( 4X/"ou’ll forgive me,” Father Er- 
X ton said in his wheezy an- 
cient voice. He was very old; rumor 
placed him at well past the century 
mark. “I should perhaps not say 
this. We are a center for study and 
distribution of information, and it’s 
only a courtesy obligation that we 
place on those who make such ex- 
tensive use of our facilities as you 
have done, to recompense us with 
some original work before leaving.” 
But he loaded the words with a glare, 
and Spartak, who had always re- 
garded the Master of his order with 
great respect, felt impelled to excuse 
himself against the implied charge. 

“I have no intention of departing 
permanently, Father,” he said. “It 
is simply that this news — ” 

“Moreover,” Father Erton contin- 
ued, totally ignoring the interrup- 
tion, “Brother Ulwyn gives us most 
unfavorable reports of this half- 
brother of yours who comes to drag 
you away. Says he is violent in the 
extreme. Heavily armed.”

IF 




“But Asconel is one of the few — " 

“You may have no intention of 
departing permanently,” Father Er- 
ton proceeded, as though his ears 
and mouth were keeping different 
time-scales, the gap between them 
amounting to several seconds. “But 
someone else — for example, the al- 
leged usurper of Asconel — may take 
no notice of what you plan. And 
your chance to return will be . 
Pffft!” 

“I’m sorry, my mind is made — ” 

“Most crucial of all is my final 
point. If you leave here and while 
absent infringe the vow you took to 
renounce all forms of violence, you 
cannot be re-admitted.” Father Er- 
ton leaned back with an effort and 
stared at Spartak. 

“I am not by temperament a vio- 
lent person,” Spartak forced out, 
acutely conscious that Father Er- 
ton’s refusal to listen to a word he 
had to say had made him long to 
employ a great deal of violence on 
his sparse gray pate. “My intention 
is merely to — ” 

“Your intention is to throw away 
ten years of valuable study on a 
heroic gesture. You may well not 
return alive, and even if you do you 
stand the same chance of turning 
back the calendar as I would have 
of combating a tidal wave. I under- 
stand your attachment to Asconel. 
Why, I myself, after seventy years, 
still occasionally find myself nostal- 
gic for my own birth world! And 
that the appeal comes from your 
half-brother makes it even more un- 
derstandable that you should be 
tempted. Nonetheless, I urge pru- 
dence, a night’s sleep before your 



linal decision, and — best ot all — a 
reconsideration.” 

Spartak got to his feet, a cold rag* 
filling his breast. “Now listen to 
me,” he said between his teeth. “You 
know what’s going to happen here? 
One of these days someone who 
doesn’t give a yard of a comet’s tail 
for some hypothetical Second Gal- 
actic Empire is going to remember 
Annanworld, and he’ll whistle up a 
few score jollyboys with armed star- 
ships and knock this pretty study 
down around your ears. Then he’ll 
pick over the survivors and choose 
out the girls for raping and some 
of the novices for general drudgery, 
and loot the wreckage for enough to 
last him out a lifetime of luxury. 
And if this doesn’t happen, it’s go- 
ing to be because a few places like 
Asconel and Loudor and Del cad ore 
held to the oldfashioned ways, stood 
up for justice and order and the 
rule of law and did their best to keep 
the pirates and the slavers and the 
privateers from off your neck!” 
Father Erton gazed up at him 
unblinkingly. He said, “It’s takea 
you ten years, has it, to come around 
to this way of thinking?” 

“No. More like ten minutes!” 
“Then go,” Father Erton sighed, 
“But remember! If you commit 
yourself to violence, save the ex- 
pense of coming back!” 

V 

T hey went a considerable distance 
in silence, with no one else in 
sight except some children on a hill- 
top, playing some game with a long 
white stick. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

Spartak was engaged with his own 
bitter thoughts, and was anyway 
used to long hours of private study 
and contemplation. It was not until 
they were almost halfway to the 
village that he spoke. 

“How did you come here? By the 
regular space-lines?” 

“Blazes, no. In this corner of the 
galaxy, shipping schedules are down 
to monthly, sometimes bi-monthly 
frequencies. I should sit on my butt 
while they get around to organizing 
a crew and lifting their creaky old 
tubs? No, I have my own ship now.” 
“Your own ship?” Spartak echoed 
in surprise. “You’ve done well. I’ve 
not heard of a privately owned star- 
ship before.” 

“Don’t picture any ship of the 
line,” Vix grunted. “I have an Im- 
perial scout, probably one of the 
original ships they tell me we found 
when we came out into space the 
very first time. I’ve never dared com- 
pute how old she must be.” 

“Twenty thousand years,” Spar- 
tak said positively. 

“Twenty — ?” It was Vix’s turn to 
be astonished. “Oh, never!” 

“If it’s one of the original Imper- 
ial vessels, it must be. According to 
what events you take as marking the 
establishment and the collapse of 
the Empire, it lasted something be- 
tween eight and a half and nine 
thousand years. By the time we 
came out to collect them, the various 
artifacts our predecessors left be- 
hind were already at least as old as 
tht whole lifespan of the Empire.” 
“This is something I’ve never got 
straight in my mind,” Vix said slow- 
ly. He seemed to be groping for 



some subject of conversation which 
would be sufficiently neutral to let 
him get to know this stranger-broth- 
er of his, who had adopted a way of 
life so alien to his temperament and 
yet now had to be his companion 
and confidant. “I guess you must 
have put in a deal of study on it — 
hm?” 

“I did when I first came to An- 
nanworld,” Spartak agreed. “I had 
this over-ambitious idea that I was 
going to find out how the Empire 
originally arose. But the records 
simply don’t exist. What little had 
been recorded was either destroyed 
or simply rotted away. We’ve never 
had the skills required to build some- 
thing to last ten thousand years. 
Even an Empire!” 

“But — well, at least you can tell 
me how it is we’re still flying ships 
supposed to be as old as you just 
said?” 

“We’ve made some intelligent 
guesses. The best and most likely is 
that at some time in their own his- 
tory the people who left the ships 
behind lost interest in physical ac- 
tivity, and built sufficient ships and 
some few other items to last out their 
— well, maybe their lifespan. Or 
else they went to another galaxy be- 
cause they’d studied this one from 
rim to rim and exhausted it and 
themselves. But they’d built well. 
It took us ten thousand years to use 
up what they left behind.” 

“It’s not used up yet, not by a 
long way,” Vix countered. 

4 4X7"es, but what time couldn’t do 
I to those ships, we’ve done 
deliberately. It costs to buy a ship, 



16 



TF 




but it doesn’t cost anything to run 
one, for they’re self-fuelling and al- 
most indestructible. The Argian fleet 
numbered one hundred and one mil- 
lion vessels at the height of Imperial 
power, and there must have been al- 
most one thousand times as many as 
that in service throughout the gal- 
axy. Yet now — as you just said — 
there are so few ships you may wait 
a month for passage on what used to 
be a flourishing Imperial starlane.” 

“We’re building some ships of our 
own, though.” 

“Where? Not in Imperial space, 
Vix. Out on the Rim, where the Im- 
perial writ never ran. I sometimes 
think I’d like to go out there, to see 
what human endeavor can do by it- 
self, without accidental help from a 
vanished race.” 

“A long trip without much pros- 
pect of reward,” Vix said. “Me, 
I’ll stick around the hub. Numbers 
like a hundred million can’t mean 
much to a man unless he’s prepared 
to think of planets as grains of dust 
and human beings as less than bac- 
teria. And no one raised on a world 
as sweet as Asconel could do that.” 

Spartak shifted his heavy load to 
the opposite shoulder. He was a little 
relieved at what Vix had just said. 
In the years since they last met, 
this fiery older brother of his had 
clearly matured as Tiorin had done, 
and there was a good chance, he 
reasoned, of their becoming friends 
at last. 

“How did you come by your 
ship?” Spartak asked eventually, af- 
ter casting around for some way of 
keeping the talk moving. 

“Took it as my pay after we put 



down the rebellion of the old Twen- 
ty-Seventh Fleet.” 

Spartak swallowed dryness and 
was glad when the other left the sub- 
ject where it lay. 

“That’s not all I’ve picked up, by 
any means. Though most of what 
I’ve had I’ve spent as fast as I got 
it. Matter of fact, I guess there may 
be some problems if you’ve fallen 
into the ways of these sexless monks 
you’ve kept so much company with.” 

“You have a girl with you?” Spar- 
tak suggested. 

“That’s right.” 

“A slave?” 

“I don’t like the tone of your 
voice,” Vix said sharply. “I don’t 
pay her regular wages, if that’s what 
you mean. But I keep her, feed her, 
clothe her — and she does the chores 
for me that a woman usually does 
for a man. But there are other rea- 
sons why a girl keeps company with 
a man without being enslaved. Have 
you forgotten, cooped up in your 
hermitage here?” 

“Have you been together long?” 
Spartak inquired peaceably. He was 
tempted to correct Vix’s mistaken 
idea of the life led by his order, but 
did not. 

“About five years altogether.” 
Vix brightened a little; they were in 
full sight of the transport terminus 
in the village. “Ah! From here we 
can get to the spaceport in under 
the hour.” 

i^nphere she is,” he exclaimed, 
A throwing up a proud arm to 
point. “The smallest vessel in sight, 
but mine. Go over and stow your 
bags. I have to pay port dues and 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

get clearance — they still observe all 
sorts of old-fashioned rules and reg- 
ulations here.” 

“Ah — this girl of yours,” Spartak 
ventured. “What’s her name, for 
when I meet her?” 

“Vineta. Don’t worry. She knows 
it’s you coming back with me, if 
anyone off this world does.” 

Spartak shrugged and made off 
across the hard gray surface of the 
port. A great deal must have changed 
in the last few years, he reflected, 
for his brother to have secured a 
ship of his own. Governments of 
planets, great trading enterprises, and 
other corporate organizations had 
owned ships under the Empire; if 
these bodies were letting go of the 
items most indispensable to the con- 
tinuance of galactic trade and com- 
munication, decay must have spread 
far and fast. 

Ther$ was one exception to the 
list of ship-owners he’d mentally 
made: pirates sometimes claimed to 
own their ships absolutely. But he 
preferred not to linger on that idea. 

He came close to the ship now. 
The access ladder was down; awk- 
wardly he clambered to the top, his 
bags swinging. He rapped on the 
door of the lock, thinking: twenty 
thousand years ! It is incredible ! 

When no one opened to him, he 
tested the manual lock release. It 
opened the door for him. 

He frowned. It was unlike Vix to 
risk leaving the ship thus. But per- 
haps this girl of his felt safe on her 
own. He climbed inside and called 
aloud. “Ah — Vineta? Are you 
there?” 

But there was no one in any of 



the accessible compartments of the 
vessel: control cabin, living quarters, 
sleeping quarters, sanitary facilities 
were all empty. 

He was standing, puzzled, in the 
control room when Vix came stamp- 
ing aboard, and forestalled the red- 
head’s questions with a curt sentence. 
“She wasn’t here when I arrived.” 
“What? Vineta! Vineta!" 

The harsh sound reverberated in 
the hollow hull. No answer came. 
Vix set to searching, as Spartak had 
just done, and came back moments 
later with his face a mask of fury. 

“Gone!” he roared. “After all I’ve 
done for her, to walk out like this — 
take to her heels without even clear- 
ing out her gear! The little baggage! 
The little radiation-spawned sweet- 
ton gued — ” 

“Vix,” Spartak said very softly, 
“are you altogether surprised?” 
“What do you mean by that?” the 
redhead blasted. 

“I remember from — from back 
home. The way you used to treat 
your women sooner or later turned 
them against you. And the life you’ve 
been leading isn’t the sort which 
would make you any more gentle.” 
“So you think she just waited till 
my back was turned and ran for it?” 
“Not exactly. But Annanworld 
had quite a reputation. Isn’t it pos- 
sible that she decided she was tired 
of a roving life? She’ll never have 
been to Asconel, probably never 
stopped on any single world with 
you for more than a short stay — ” 
“What are you talking like this 
for? You never even saw the girl!” 
Vix wiped away sweat that had 
started on his forehead. “Ach! Go 



18 



IF 




stow your gear in the lower cabin. 
That was hers, and some of her 
things are still there. I’m going to 
ask the port authorities what became 
of her, and fetch her back by her 
hair if I have to.” 

He gave his half-brother a final 
withering glare. “Well, move! Or 
would you rather I left her behind, 
because it might embarrass you to 
have my mistress here in such a 
confined space? Is that why you’re 
trying to talk me into thinking it’s 
my fault? If she was going to run 
off she could have done it on a 
dozen other worlds without waiting 
for this precious favorite of yours!” 
Spartak said nothing, but picked 
up his bags and made his way to the 
lower cabin as directed. 

VI 

A frown of self-directed anger 
pulling his brows into deep fur- 
rows over his nose, Spartak glanced 
around the lower cabin, barely tak- 
ing in the pathetic few belongings 
which bore witness to the occupancy 
of it by the girl Vineta. He had not 
meant to spark an argument with 
Vix; it was simply that ten years on 
Annanworld had accustomed him to 
going straight' to the point in the in- 
terests of exposing the truth, and he 
had largely forgotten how to use 
tact. He had been shorn of most of 
his false conceptions of himself, and 
was glad to have lost them. But it 
made no odds that Vix had almost 
certainly treated his girl the same as 
he had always treated women — 
even beating her occasionally. To 
have told him that she had probably 



grown tired of aim and run off was 
a stupid error. 

Sighing, he cleared away the mis- 
cellaneous junk disposed on the 
shelves and in the drawers. Without 
his at first realizing, they made a 
picture to him: a kind* of implied 
portrait of their owner. This cur- 
iously shaped seashell, from some 
planet where the mollusca had a 
copper-based metabolism to judge 
by the bluish sheen of the lining; this 
necklet of rock crystal, pink and 
blue and yellow; this solido of two 
smiling elderly folk — her parents, 
possibly? 

It wasn’t until he came to tall 
closets in the far corner and found 
half a dozen costumes hanging 
there, together with a small stringed 
instrument which he did not recog- 
nize, that he checked and started to 
think seriously about the conclusions 
he ought to draw. Even then he 
went ahead with what he had origin- 
ally intended — changing clothes, 
putting aside the brown robe of his 
order in favor of garments not worn 
since his arrival on Annanworld, but 
still a fair fit to his body, whose 
leanness had remained constant since 
his late adolescence. 

There was a reminder in that 
stringed instrument of his own 
mother, who had been a wandering 
singer and teacher. It was the means 
of getting a living. Surely that, and 
the clothing, would not have been 
left behind, no matter how eager 
she was to escape Vix and lose her- 
self on Annanworld? And it was 
still less likely that she should have 
abandoned small souvenir items, 
like the solido, which were no bur- 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



19 




den to carry and presumably held 
emotional significance for her. 

Maybe she went aground to buy 
something , he told himself at last, 
marvelling how sluggish his mind 
had been made by the annoyance 
his disagreement with Vix had 
caused. I must tell Vix not to do any- 
thing rash — 

In that instant, when he stood 
with one leg in his old but service- 
able breeches of Vellian silk, the 
ship’s gravity went on, and within 
seconds he felt the surging of the 
drive. 

This was not the slickly smooth 
operation of a large liner, elaborate- 
ly maintained for the passengers’ 
comfort — like the only other ves- 
sels in which he had ever flown 
space. It was the jarring violence 
of a scoutship stripped for action, 
without frills, and seemed to vibrate 
all the way into his belly, triggering 
a reflex nausea. 

He resisted it in near-panic, 
thinking what foul company Vix 
would be if he worked out for him- 
self, many systems distant, what 
Spartak had just deduced from the 
clothing still in the cabin. 

He struggled out into the corri- 
dor, and ' as he turned from sliding 
shut the cabin door caught a glimpse 
of movement at the foot of the 
companionway leading up to the 
control room*. It was too brief, and 
the drive-induced nausea was now 
too strong, for him to get a clear 
view of the person who had gone 
by, but the obvious deduction was 
that Vineta was aboard after all. 

He had no time to work out 
where she might have been hiding. 



He was completely unfamiliar with 
this design of ship, and if Vix hadn't 
found her she must have concealed 
herself very thoroughly. Or else 
Vix himself wasn’t yet aware of 
all the nooks and crannies in his 
prized new possession . 

No, rational thought was beyond 
him at the moment. Wait till the 
drive settled down to free-space 
operation. That would be soon 
enough to solve the riddle. 

He was on the point of returning 
to his cabin when he heard the cry. 
“Spa-ar-tak!” 

And the drive went off. 

T he shock was like a dash of 
cold water, clearing the fog 
from his brain. With reflex speed 
he made for the companionway, 
scrambling up it with the agility of 
a Sirian ape. 

The shock was renewed as soon 
as he saw what was happening in 
the control room. It was no girl 
that he had glimpsed passing this 
way. It was a man, huge and bulky 
as a Thanis bull, his hair wild, his 
body cased in crude leather harness 
and his feet in steel-tipped boots, 
who now was wrestling chest-to-chest 
with the tough but far smaller Vix, 
overbearing the redhead in a crush- 
ing embrace. 

Vix tried to butt him on the nose, 
failed as the attacker jerked his 
head back, lost his balance to one 
of the steel-tipped boots as it crack- 
ed against his ankle, and went slam- 
ming down to the floor. 

He had had no time to draw his 
sidearms, obviously. Perhaps he’d 
mistaken the sound of the stranger’s 



20 



IF 





approach for Spartak’s. But he’d 
done well in the first instance, for a 
short sword lay at the foot of the 
control board: his assailant’s, logical- 
ly, which he had somehow contrived 
to dash from his grip. 

Horrified, Spartak saw the two 
antagonists crash to their full length, 
saw the stranger break Vix’s grasp 
on his right wrist and force his 
hand closer and closer to the red- 
head’s throat. Wild pleading showed 
in the green eyes, but there was no 
breath available for him to call for 
aid again. 

To renounce his oath so soon? 
To pick up the sword from the 
floor and drive it into the stranger’s 
back? It could be done, but — 

And then he remembered, as 
clearly as if he were hearing it in 
present time, the voice of one of 
his earliest tutors on Annanworld. 
“Always bear in mind that the need 
for violence is an illusion. If it 
seems that violence is unavoidable, 
what this means is that you’ve left 
the problem too late before starting 
to tackle it.” 

Spartak dodged the struggling 
men and made for the control board. 
As he scanned the totally unfamiliar 
switches, he heard a sobbing cry 
from Vix — “Spartak, Spartak, he’s 
going to strangle me!” 

Time seemed to plod by for him, 
while racing at top speed for his 
brother. But at last he thought he 
had it. He put one hand on the 
back of the pilot chair, and with the 
other slammed a switch over past 
its neutral points to the opposite 
extreme of its traverse. 

Instantly he went heels over head. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



21 




But he was prepared for this; in 
effect, he fell to the ceiling like a 
gymnast turning a somersault, and 
landed on his feet with a jar that 
shook him clear to the hips. The 
universe rolled insanely around him. 

Through a swirling mist of giddi- 
ness he saw that what he had in- 
tended had indeed come about. 
Locked in their muscle-straining em- 
brace, Vix and the unknown had 
crashed ten feet to the ceiling as 
the gravity reversed, and now Vix 
was on top — and breaking free! 
For the force of the upside-down 
fall had completely stunned the 
stranger. 

Spartak reached out, clutching 
Vix by the loose baldric on which 
he normally slung his energy-gun, 
and reversed the gravity once more, 
restoring its normal direction. The 
attacker slammed to the floor again 
while he and Vix feH rather less 
awkwardly; this time, he moved the 
switch with careful slowness, not 
exceeding a quarter-gravity till he 
felt his soles touch the floor. 

And then he said, “Who is he?” 

“I — I — ” Vix put his hands to 
his temples and pressed, breathing 
in enormous sobbing gasps. “What 
did you do?” 

“I put the gravity over to full 
negative.” 

“But — ” Vix began to recover 
— “but — how? Do you know these 
ships, then?” 

“No, I’ve never seen one before. 
But it followed logically. There’s 
always an automatic gravity com- 
pensator on a starship, for high-gee 
maneuvering in normal space. It 
seemed reasonable to expect a man- 



ual override on a vessel like this 
which might get damaged during 
combat.” 

“You mean you just took a chance 
on it, while he was throttling the 
life out of me?” Vix exploded. 

C learly the redhead had suffered 
one of the worst frights of his 
life. Spartak hesitated. 

“Why didn’t you just pick up his 
sword and run him through with 
it?” Vix blasted on. 

“Ah — well, if I’d done that,” 
Spartak countered in the calmest 
tone he could manage, “he wouldn’t 
have been able to tell us who he is 
and why he set on you. As it is, 
here he’s no more than stunned. And 
you’re alive to ask him questions.” 
“I guess so,” Vix agreed sullenly, 
and gave the dazed attacker a prod 
in the ribs with his foot. “I look 
forward to beating some answers 
out of him, at that. Here, I’ll put 
some lashings on him before he 
wakes up.” 

He started to a corner chest in 
search of ropes. 

“I don’t think you’ll have to beat 
the information out,” Spartak ven- 
tured. “I have some stuff with me 
which will probably make him talk 
a lot faster than that.” 

“Such as what?” Vix found a 
length of braided leather and a short 
flexible chain, and started to bind 
the man’s limbs. 

“I — uh — brought some medical 
things I thought might come in 
handy,” Spartak said, swallowing 
hard. Ever since his childhood, 
fighting and violence had physically 
upset him, and the glee in Vix’s 



22 



IP 




voice as he proposed torturing the 
man to make him talk had picked 
up the backwash of the nausea from 
the drive and redoubled it. “I’ll go 
fetch it right away!” 

But first, he told himself, he’d 
better take a dose of something to 
calm his own stomach. 

He was at the door of the lower 
cabin, fumbling to open the sliding 
panel, when he felt the knocking be- 
neath his feet. 

Astonished, he stared down at 
the flooring of featureless metal 
plates. The knocking came again, 
more vigorously, and his eyes sud- 
denly spotted a small cluster of new 
bright scratches at one end of the 
plate on which he stood. 

“By the moons of Argus!” he 
exploded, and dropped to his knees 
to lever up the plate and push it 
aside. 

In the compartment thus revealed 
lay the missing Vineta, a crude 
cloth gag in her mouth, her clothing 
torn and a huge bruise discoloring 
the soft olive skin of her right cheek. 
She was small and slender, but 
even so her assailant had had to 
cram her by main force into the tiny 
space under the floor. 

Frantically he lifted her out and 
set her on her feet; she stood for a 
second holding on to him, shaking 
out her space-black hair, then seem- 
ed to recover a little and let go 
of his arm. He made to remove the 
gag, but she shook her head and 
tore it out herself. 

“Are you Vix’s brother?” she 
whispered. Her voice was hoarse. 

“Yes — yes, I’m Spartak.” 

“Is he — ?” 



“He’s all right. He’s up in the 
control room tying up the man who 
attacked him — and you too, pre- 
sumably. How did it happen?” 

“He had a message sent from the 
port controller to say he was some 
sort of official.” Vineta swallow- 
ed painfully. “And Vix had told me 
that on Annanworld they had lots 
of regulations left over from Imperial 
days, which we’d have to comply 
with or be delayed in leaving. So I 
let him come aboard.” 

She passed a weary hand over 
her forehead and then touched the 
bruise on her cheek, wincing. 
“Thank you for letting me out,” she 
whispered. “I was so afraid . 

And she turned to hurry in search 
of Vix. 

Spartak watched her go. The rips 
in her costume exposed much more 
of her tight, firm body than he 
cared to see, and a completely ir- 
rational envy overcame him against 
his will, at the thought of the end- 
less succession of beautiful women 
Vix had enjoyed and abandoned. 
Contrary to the assumption Vix had 
made, his order on Annanworld 
didn’t demand celibacy, and even 
Father Erton had kept up an asso- 
ciation with a woman in the same 
specialization as himself which had 
endured for almost thirty years. But 
his own two or three attempts to 
form such a relationship had floun- 
dered on his shyness and his re- 
luctance to detach himself from his 
studies. 

Now, without warning, he found 
he was wistful, as if he had left 
some very important part out of his 
life.

VII 

T he last thing he expected to find 
when he returned to the con- 
trol room clutching his large black 
medical case was a full-blown shout- 
ing match. But he heard it even 
before he came in. Vix was bellow- 
ing at the girl. 

“You realize he could have killed 
me? You just let him in. Opened 
the lock for him and let him in! 
You didn’t keep a gun on him, or 
anything sensible like that — oh, 
no, you wouldn’t have thought of 
it!” 

“But you told me yourself we 
had to . .!” The answer dissolved 
on a high note which foreshadowed 
tears. 

“What conceivable reason could 
the controller have to send some- 
one aboard before I got back?” Vix 
thundered. “I ought to take the hide 
off you!” 

Spartak pushed the door aside, 
and Vineta ran into him blindly, 
making headlong for the privacy of 
the lower cabin. He caught her with 
his free hand, and spoke sharply to 
Vix. 

“You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself! Just because you’ve been 
scared white, that’s no reason to 
take it out on her. She’s had a 
worse shock than you have — look 
at that bruise on her! And you 
know where I found her? Folded 
up like an embryo in a tiny hole 
under the floor of the lower corri- 
dor! Here,” he added in a gentler 
tone to the girl, looking for a 
place to set down his medical case. 
“I’ll put something on the bruise 



and give you a pill to calm your 
nerves.” 

She accepted his ministrations 
dumbly, swallowed the pill as di- 
rected, and whispered, “Can I go 
now?” 

“Lie down for a while. You’ll be 
all right.” Spartak gave her a com- 
forting pat on the shoulder and 
stood aside for her to leave. 

“I’m — sorry,” Vix said with 
an effort as the door slid to. “You’re 
right. I oughtn’t to talk to her that 
way.” 

“It’s better to think of points like 
that in advance and not afterwards,” 
Spartak answered curtly, and crossed 
the floor to drop to his knees beside 
the bound man. “Hm! How long 
has he been awake?” 

“Awake?” Vix echoed in astonish- 
ment. “I thought he was still knock- 
ed out.” 

“Hold it,” Spartak rapped, for- 
seeing that Vix’s next impulse would 
be to kick the man into talking. 
“Let’s see what I can do to loosen 
his tongue before you — ” He reach- 
ed behind him for an injector and 
a small phial of grayish liquid. 

“What are you going to give 
him?” Vix demanded. 

“It’s one of the old Imperial 
drugs. Not really meant as a truth 
drug, but supposed to bring forgot- 
ten experiences back to conscious- 
ness during psychotherapy.” With 
deft fingers he loaded the injector. 

“Why did you think that of all 
drugs might come in handy?” Vix 
grunted. “Think I might be pre- 
cessing my gyros, maybe?” 

“You do take everything person- 
ally, don’t you?” Spartak sighed. “As

IF 




a matter of fact, I thought it might 
help us to find out how this Be- 
lizuek cult gets the hold it’s sup- 
posed to have over apparently ra- 
tional people like Hodat. There,” 
he added, shooting the dose into 
the bound man’s wrist veins. 

“How long does it take to work?” 

“A few seconds. Open your eyes, 
you!” 

The bound man complied after an 
obvious struggle to go on feigning 
unconsciousness. 

“Who are you? Where are you 
from?” Spartak asked. 

“I’m — ” Another, equally un- 
successful struggle to still his tongue, 
and a yielding. “I’m Korisu, and I 
come from Asconel.” ^ 

“From — !” Vix toofe^a pace for- 
ward in amazed horror. 

“What was your missioMSand who 
ordered you to do it?” 

H is eyes fixed open and seeming 
glazed, the man whispered, “I 
was sent by Bucyon to track down 
Vix and kill him.” 

“Why?” thundered Vix. 

“Because he’d heard that you 
planned to raise on army and de- 
pose him, and wipe out Belizuek on 
Asconel.” 

“I’m Spartak, Vix’s half-brother,” 
Spartak said softly. “Does my name 
mean anything to you?” 

“Y-yes. After I’d found and kill- 
ed Vix, since I was on Annanworld 
anyway, I was to locate you and 
eliminate you as well.” 

“Has someone been sent after 
Tiorin?” Vix demanded. 

“I — I don’t know for sure. I 
think so. But nobody knew where he 



was when I left home. There was a 
rumor that he had gone towards 
the hub, to travel in what’s left of 
the Empire. Someone mentioned 
Delcadore.” 

“Then that’s where we’ll go!” Vix 
declared, and strode towards the 
control board. 

“Just a moment,” Spartak said. 
“There are some other things I 
want to set straight. You,. Korisu. 
Are you a follower of Belizuek?” 

“Of course I am. Everyone on 
Asconel is nowadays.” 

Vix uttered a filthy string of 
oaths. 

“What is Belizuek?” 

“He is all-seeing and all-power- 
ful. He reads the inmost thoughts 
of men and no one can stand against 
him. He’s a superior being. Men 
ought to recognize that and serve 
him.” 

“Is he a telepathic mutation from 
human stock?” 

“I’ve never seen him. But the 
priests say he’s different. Superior. 
Deserving of our worship.” 

Spartak wiped sweat from his 
face. “I’m told he demands human 
sacrifices. Is that true?” 

“No, of course not!” Shocked, 
the bound man tried to sit up, and 
failed. “The priests say it’s blasphe- 
my to call it sacrifice. It’s a free- 
will offering! It’s an honor to serve 
Belizuek in that way just as in any 
other.” 

Spartak’s jaw set in a grim line. 
If in such a short time Bucyon and 
his consort Lydis had managed to 
persuade the citizens of Asconel that 
this transcendent rubbish was the 
revealed and mystic truth, their mis- 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEl 



25 




son wasn’t going to be confined to 
so simple a task as deposing the 
usurper and restoring the rightful 
Warden. 

“Where does Belizuek come 
from?” 

“The priests say he’s existed since 
the beginning of the galaxy.” 

“Then where is Brinze?” 

“That’s where Shry and Bucyon 
and Lydis and some of the others 
come from. But I don’t know where 
it lies.” 

“Delcadore,” Vix muttered to 
himself, over at the control board. 
“I’d not meant to go so close to 
the hub. There are still idiots around 
there with dreams of Imperial glory, 
and it’s risky. But if that’s where 
Tiorin is said to be . .” He glanc- 
ed over his shoulder. “I have a 
course set up now. Anything more 
you want from him?” 

“Not right now.” Spartak straight- 
ened. “What shall we do with him?” 
“Put him where he put Vineta. 
Why not?” 

“No, that’s too small — literally 
and absolutely. In a closet we can 
lock, that would do.” 

“There’s an empty one next to 
the head,” Vix grunted. “I’ll help 
you lug him down there.” 

S till weary from the mental strain 
as well as from the physical ef- 
fort of hauling the reluctant 
Korisu to his prison, Spartak stole 
into the lower cabin. Vineta had 
stretched out on the left bunk, and 
was sleeping with deep and regular 
breathing. Near her pillow she had 
ranged the little objects to which 
she plainly attached a great deal of 



value: the shell, the solido, the 
cheap jewelry. 

Spartak put his medical case away 
and crept out again. 

“You again, Spartak?” Vix called 
as he re-entered the control cabin. 
“Say — iih — I ought to thank 
you. 1 guess I was too shaken up to 
remember. It was very smart, the 
way you stopped the fight. And it 
was just as weM we tackled him 
your way and not mine. Apart from 
anything else, I imagine you’re now 
convinced that I wasn’t spinning you 
a wild fantasy about what’s hap- 
pened on Asconel!” 

Spartak shook his head distracted- 
ly. “It’s incredible,” he muttered. 
“The speed and completeness of 
the process, to have produced a 
fanatic like Korisu in so short a 
time. It almost persuades me that 
you were right about an element of 
witchcraft.” 

Vix hesitated. Then he put out 
his hand. “Brother, I was in two 
minds whether to go to Annanworld 
and seek you out. I wondered if 1 
might not burden myself. But ten 
years is a slice out of any man’s life, 
and love for a world like Asconel is 
enough of a bond to bring men to- 
gether.” 

Spartak put his hand into th 
other’s grasp. 

But the full measure of Korisu's 
fanaticism did not emerge until 
much later — until the time when 
they went to feed him in his 
cramped prison and found that he 
had contrived to strangle himself, 
against all probability, with the 
braided leather Vix had used to bind 
bis arms . 



26 



IF 




T he shadow of that incredible 
death still lay over them when 
they gathered in the control room 
to watch the planet Delcadore grow 
beyond the main ports. To break the 
intolerable silence between them, 
Vineta — recovered almost com- 
pletely from her treatment at the 
hands of Korisu — spoke up. 

“What sort of a world is this 
one, now?” 

Vix, occupied with the controls, 
tossed an answering grunt over his 
shoulder. “Ask Spartak. He has the 
head full of knowledge. I’ve not 
followed the progress of events 
down here towards the hub. Still too 
rigid and organized for my taste, to 
be candid!” 

The girl glanced at Spartak rather 
shyly. They had hardly yet got to 
know one another during this brief 
trip, and she had spent most of her 
time out of the way of both broth- 
ers, although Spartak had seen 
enough to convince him that Vix 
still at heart regarded women as 
expendable. Currently, he just did 
not have the time to get himself 
another if he lost Vineta, and was 
doing his clumsy best to keep on 
her right side. 

“Well,” Spartak commenced, “this 
was formerly one of the main garri- 
son systems for the Imperial fleet. 
When the Empire began to lose its 
outer reaches this was one of the 
— the foci, so to speak, on which 
retrenchments were made. I think 
it’s now effectively a frontier sys- 
tem. The Empire hasn’t vanished, 
of course, but only shrunk to a 
fraction of its former size.” 
“That’s what’s worrying me,” Vix 



interjected. “I’ve tangled with "cer- 
tain boneheaded parties who seem to 
imagine the Empire still flourishes. 
For my part, I think it’s now a 
farce, and will only prove a handi- 
cap to some new and more stable 
foundation.” 

Spartak nodded in surprised agree- 
ment. 

At that moment a light sprang 
up on the communicator panel, and 
Vix reached over to activate the 
circuit. A voice boomed out with 
a ring of crude authority. “Identify 
yourself and your ship!” 

“See what I mean?” Vix mut- 
tered wryly, and added more loud- 
ly, for the benefit of the distant 
challenger, “Vix of Asconel piloting 
my own vessel, on private business 
and landing on Delcadore.” 

“Asconel, hm?” Thg voice was as 
clear as if it came from the next 
room, even when at lower volume 
it continued, “Where in all of space 
is that?” 

Other voices, much fainter but 
quite distinct, chimed in. “Asconel 
— isn’t that where . .? Well, it’s 
off towards the Rim anyway, so I 
guess it’ll do . Anything to shift 
this problem off my back . Yes, 
we’ll settle for this one — we don’t 
want to wait till the galaxy freezes 
just to find a ship bound for the 
Big Dark or somewhere really dis- 
tant ...” 

Vix and Spartak exchanged ap- 
palled glances, and the first voice 
roared out again. 

“Vix of Asconel, you’re under 
Imperial requisition. Do you hear 
and understand? Your ship is under 
Imperial requisition. Do not attempt 



WE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



27 





EUNORA 



to evade this order, or it will be the 
worse for you?” 

“What does this all mean?” Vineta 
whispered. 

“Right now, that’s what it means!” 
Vix replied in white-lipped fury, and 
gestured towards the viewport which 
moments ago had held only Delca- 
dore, its larger moon and the stars, 
beyond. 

Now, like a monstrous fish swim- 
ming leisurely to intercept smaller 
prey, there loomed the gigantic shape 
of an Imperial ship of the line, the 
ancient Argian symbols blazoned at 
prow and stern, for all the galaxy 
as though. Argus could still issue 
orders to a million planets, and pre- 
pared to back this false contention 
with the all-too-real support of fire- 
power equal to the output of a mi- 
nor sun. 

VIII 

F ighting and running were out of 
the question. When the order 
was given to take a landing on 
Delcadore under the escort of the 
Imperial battleship, Vix — punctual- ■ 
ing his pilot work with oaths that 
seemed to grow fouler by the sec- 
f ond — furiously complied, while 
I Spartak tried to console him with 
l the suggestion that at least so far 
they weren’t being told to do any- 
(r\ thing but what they had intended all 
w along. 

$ Meanwhile, Vineta stood close 
vj against him, her large dark eyes 
fixed as though hypnotized on the 
A. hull of the escorting ship, her whole 
body trembling with the unexpressed 
\& terror she felt at the nameless threat 



28 



IF 




the '‘Imperial requisition” implied. 

Spartak’s heart lifted, though 
only briefly, when he saw what 
forces the Empire could still com- 
mand. There might be a thousand 
vessels, he guessed, docked here at 
what huge illuminated signs still de- 
clared to be the Headquarters Port 
of the Third Imperial Fleet. Then 
he took a second look at those 
monstrous hulls, ranged like a for- 
est of branchless metal trees across 
the concrete plain, and realized he 
had failed to make an obvious de- 
duction. 

The Empire, by all accounts, was 
struggling against decay and rebel- 
lion all through the galaxy. Why 
then were so many ships out of the 
sky at one place and one time? 
And he began to spot the clues 
which accounted for their presence: 
gashed hulls from distant battles, 
plating removed by the hundreds of 
square feet to expose the vital equip- 
ment within which was being can- 
nibalized to maintain those ships 
still capable of flight. 

Maybe somewhere out near the 
rim there was a world where ships 
stood like this in vast numbers, but 
not antiques used to the limit by 
reckless commanders — new ships, 
human-made, ready to bring in- 
wards to the hub those who for 
ten millennia had been harried away 
from the Argian domains and had 
bided their time on the threshold 
of intergalactic emptiness, waiting 
for the inevitable collapse. 

If there were such a world, he 
thought, it would be worth hunting 
for. 

The shadow of an idea crossed 



his mind, and was dispelled immedi- 
ately by the arrival alongside their 
own vessel of officials from the 
port controller’s staff. 

Vix vented his anger on them in 
a single blast of abuse and com- 
plaint. They ignored him as they 
might have ignored a breath of 
wind. Spartak, urging Vix aside, at- 
tempted to tackle them .on a more 
rational basis, inquiring the au- 
thority for “Imperial requisition” 
and contesting the legality of giving 
orders to non-imperial citizens. 

The officials sighed and produced 
guns. It seemed that this had become 
the standard substitute for argu- 
ment on Delcadore. 

All three of them were taken — 
for Vineta refused to stay alone 
aboard the ship after her experience 
on Annanworld — to wait in a large, 
light anteroom outside the office of 
the port controller. There was no 
one else there apart from a man 
of early middle age, who to their 
horror lacked both a leg and < an 
arm. They could not refrain from 
staring at him; on a world return- 
ing to barbarism after the with- 
drawal of Imperial support, such a 
sight might have been expected, but 
Delcadore was supposed to be an 
outpost of the still viable Argian 
civilization. 

T he man cracked a bitter smile 
as he saw their eyes covertly 
turning on his injuries. 

“I’m not pretty any longer, am 
I?” he rasped. “Well, not to wonder 
at that! If you’d been picked out 
of an airless wreck the way I was, 
you’d have ...” A fit of cough- 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



29 




ing interrupted his angry words, and 
racked his body for a good minute 
before he could answer Spartak’s 
tense questions. 

“Oh, sure they’ll fix me up sooner 
or later. But that can wait, they 
tell me. I’m the only survivor from 
my whole team, and all they want 
to know is where they went wrong. 
I’m going to tell ’em, too! Without 
mincing my words!” 

“What happened?” Vix snapped. 

“Fools — gas-brained fools! I 
could have told them . .” The 
man’s eyes unfocused, staring 
through the wall at a faraway disas- 
ter. “Hiring pirates, that’s what 
they’ve hit on as their latest brain- 
wave! A whole Imperial fleet re- 
volts under a commander who thinks 
he can do better than the mud- 
heads we have in charge at the mo- 
ment. And who’s to say he couldn’t? 
Sometimes I think / could! And 
what do they do to combat this? 
They hire a ramshackle bunch of 
pirate ships, thinking to keep them 
from pillaging some Imperial planet 
this way, send out a command 
echelon to give the orders — that’s 
where I got involved — and sit back 
and pour some more ancinard. And 
what happens? Exactly what any 
schoolchild would have said! You 
can’t give pirates orders, so they 
break and run. And the Imperial- 
trained rebels pick them off like 
scooting watersliders, and then the 
Imperials-that-were loot the very 
planet the pirates were aiming for, 
to make up for the inconvenience 
and minor losses they suffered!” 

“Which fleet?” Vix demanded. 

“The Eighteenth.” The injured 



man stared at him. “What other did 
you think it was?” 

“What do you mean, ‘what oth- 
er’?” Vix countered. “The Twenty- 
Seventh is wiped out, as I well know. 
But it could have been the Tenth, 
or the Fortieth, or the Forty-Second, 
or — ” He broke off, the other man’s 
eyes burning at him. 

“Are you sure?” the cripple whis- 
pered, after glancing around to make 
sure there was no one else in ear- 
shot. 

“Of course. I’ve just come from 
Annanworld, before that I was at 
Batyra Dap, and before that Poow- 
adya, and before that — ” 

“All these fleets are still operat- 
ing? In revolt, but still operating?” 
“At the last hearing, yes. Bar 
the Twenty-Seventh, as I mention- 
ed.” 

“The liars,” the cripple whispered. 
“The dirty, double-tongued, deceiv- 
ing, damnable — ” 

“Vix of Asconel!” a speaker cried 
from the wall. “Go to the door which 
will open on your right. Bring your 
companions with you.” 

Puzzled at the cripple’s reaction, 
Spartak lingered to put a final ques- 
tion to him, and got the answer he 
had half expected but was barely 
able to credit. 

If a high-ranking officer of the 
cracked Third Imperial Fleet had 
been lied to about the fate of so 
many other fleets, lying must have 
become the general policy of the 
rump Empire. 

How long could it stand on false- 
hood? He had envisaged another 
century or so before its prestige di- 
minished to the point at which 



10 



IF 




rebels and outlaws were tempted 
clear down to the hub — ultimately 
perhaps to Argus itself. 

But if they were already so des- 
perate at the reduction of their loyal- 
ist forces that they were hiring pir- 
ates as mercenaries, the word 
would travel fast. And the next 
time the Empire would find pirates 
and rebels combined against it. 
There would be an end to futile 
shifts like trying to make the two 
enemies destroy each other. 

G loomy beyond description, he 
found he had followed Vix and 
Vineta into the adjacent office, and 
there confronted a podgy, gray-hair- 
ed woman in a uniform encrusted 
with meaningless decorations and 
ostentatious badges of rank. 

“Sit down,” she said tonelessly. 
“Which of you is Vix, the alleged 
owner of the ship we’ve requisition- 
ed?” 

“Alleged!” Vix purpled again. “I 
have clear title — ” 

“I’m not arguing,” the woman 
sighed. “If you want to go into 
legalisms, starships are by defini- 
tion Imperial property and only 
leased to corporations, trading com- 
panies or — save the mark — in- 
dividuals.” Her mouth twisted as 
though in disgust. “But where would 
it get me to rely on a thin argument 
like that? I imagine you’re competent 
to handle the ship, and if I wanted 
to commandeer it I’d have to pick 
someone equally skillful. And that’s 
not easy because next thing you 
know he’d be headed for the great 
black yonder . 

Spartak found himself suddenly 



pitying the woman, for she had de- 
fined herself instantly by what she 
had said: a weary official trying to 
keep things going while chaos bat- 
tered at the structure of law, order 
and principle by which she had to 
be guided. He signalled Vix to be 
quiet, and leaned forward. 

“May we know your authority?" 

The woman blinked heavy lids a t 
him. “Frankly, I’m not sure which 
capacity I’m acting in right now. 
I have so many jobs I sometimes 
lose track. I sit in this room as 
assistant immigration supervisor* 
Delcadore West/North Sector. I 
have the requisition on your ship 
as Acting Transport Director, Im- 
perial space, Delcadore volume. And 
I’m under orders from the planetary 
government, department of public 
order.” 

“We have business here,” Spartak 
said. “If we could know what you 
want our ship for, we could per- 
haps — ” 

“To the Big Dark with your busi- 
ness,” the woman said. “I have a 
solution to one fiddling little prob- 
lem out of about ten thousand wait- 
ing for me to deal with, and I’m 
not disposed to compromise.” 

“Now you listen to me!” Vix burst 
out. “First off, my ship is mine and 
I’m not handing it over to anyone 
who still has delusion of glory about 
the Empire! Second, my business 
here is important not only to me 
but to my home planet, and I’m not 
going to be cheated out of it. And 
thirdly — ” 

“Oh, shut up,” the woman said. 
“Third is probably going to be some- 
thing about not being an Imperial

citizen. You’re an Imperial citizen 
if you were born on any planet 
which was ever part of the Empire, 
and Asconel was. Your Warden still 
holds his fief from Argus, and his 
spacefleet too.” 

“The blazes he does! The present 
Warden’s a usurper, and he brought 
his fleet with him from some world 
called Brinze which the Imperial rec- 
ords don’t show!” 

“I wouldn’t know,” the woman 
shrugged. “Don’t think I have time 
to keep up with what’s happening 
on backwater planets like that, do 
you? What’s left of the Empire 
generates enough problems to keep 
my attention fully occupied. So swal- 
low this, and digest it at leisure. 

4CTX7e have a girl here who can 
▼ ▼ apparently read minds — a 
mutant, obviously. We could have 
let her be stoned to death, I guess. 
Things are nearly that bad already, 
even on Delcadore. But when we 
can, we cling to the Imperial rules, 
because they’re better than anything 
else we have. And the Imperial rules 
say we keep the status quo by put- 
ting her out of the way on some 
habitable planet off towards the rim. 

“In the old days we could have 
assigned her passage on regular liner- 
routes, under Imperial guard and 
protection to make sure some super- 
stitious knot-head didn’t assassinate 
her before she reached where she 
was sent. According to my best in- 
formation — which I’ll share with you 
since you’re from way out anyway — 
there isn’t a single commercial rout- 
ing left which would get her to a 
rim system in less than a year. Co- 



ordination has gone to hell, schedules 
aren’t reliable, and pirates are pick- 
ing off so much traffic the lines are 
closing down or flying only in 
armed convoy. 

“So you’ll have to do. I’m having 
this girl brought here from wherever 
the blazes she’s been kept, and the 
moment she arrives you’re going to 
take off and head for — what’s the 
name of that place?” She pushed a 
stud on the arm of her chair and 
consulted a small screen set at an 
angle beside her. “Ah, yes — Ny- 
lock. I picked it because it’s com- 
paratively close: a straight-line route 
from here to the rim.” 

Vix was half out of his chair with 
rage. “You can’t do this!” he thun- 
dered. 

“Be grateful,” the woman said 
stonily. “I could have sent you any- 
where — out the far side of the 
Big Dark, come to that! Now do 
you fancy your chances with the 
pirates in that volume, hey? Used to 
take three Imperial battleships to get 
across there safely!” 

Spartak, controlling himself bet- 
ter than Vix but nonetheless white- 
hot inside, forced out, “What right 
have you to make the requisition 
anyway?” 

“Argian decree,” the woman said. 
“If you want the number and text 
I’ll get it for you, but it runs to 
seventy figures and two full record- 
ing crystals, and seeing it won’t 
make a grain of difference. I don’t 
care for your business on Delcadore, 
I don’t care for your complaints and 
objections — all I care about is 
getting shut of one irritating prob- 
lem.”

IF 




She stabbed another stud on her 
ohair-arm, and the doors of the 
room slid back. 

“And don’t think, either, that 
there’s an easy way to avoid doing 
as you’re told. Dumping the girl in 
space when you get out of our juris- 
diction, for instance, and trying to 
sneak back here. You’ll be welcome 
to conduct your business when you’ve 
finished ours. And to make sure 
you do — ” 

Soft footfalls sounded behind 
Spartak’s chair, and he half-turned 
to see menacing uniformed figures 
there. 

“We condition you,” the woman 
said. “You won’t be able to be com- 
fortable or happy or sexually potent 
or even sleep properly from now on 
unless you’re directing all your ef- 
forts to the completion of the mis- 
sion on which you’re sent.” 

IX 

T he efficiency of the conditioning 
process was flawless: imperson- 
al as a mechanical repair, thorough 
as the work of a first-rate surgeon. 

Spartak, who knew something of 
this and related psychological tech- 
niques from his wide researches on 
Annanworld, 'had hoped to offer at 
least token resistance to the drugs 
and hypnotic instructions employed 
on him. But it was useless. As 
though a shutter had snapped down 
over his brain, he blanked out, and 
on re-awakening he found he could 
recall nothing of what had happen- 
ed except at the two extreme levels 
of his awareness. 

Consciously he knew he had been 



conditioned. Subconsciously he was 
disturbed, as it were by an itch, that 
was already intense and would grow 
to be unbearable if he did not at 
once comply with the Imperial or- 
der. 

He was appalled beyond measure. 
If this experience was anything to 
go by, it appeared that the chief 
tools of the Imperial power had 
been reduced to lies, propaganda and 
the threat of obliteration. 

Small comfort, in view of that, to 
know that the galaxy now held forces 
too strong to be impressed by the 
last of those three instruments! 

And perhaps worst of all was the 
fact that they were so confident of 
the reliability of the conditioning, 
they permitted him, Vix and Vineta 
to return to the ship without es- 
cort. knowing that until the telepa- 
thic girl was delivered to them they 
would sit and wait, and once she 
arrived they would helplessly depart 
for Nylock, the only place in the 
galaxy where they could be sure of 
release from the imprinted command. 

“Is there nothing we can do?” 
Vix pleaded for the tenth time. His 
courage in regular combat, his 
habitual assertive self-confidence, 
availed him not at all when faced 
by a weapon as subtle as this con- 
ditioning. It had perhaps been an in- 
spiration on the part of the gray- 
haired woman to cite sexual impo- 
tence as one of the consequences of 
failing to comply with her decree; 
in any case, Spartak was reminded of 
a theory he had once formed about 
this redhaired half-brother of his. 
His insatiable demand for women, 
the theory proposed, was a way of 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



33 




compensating for the fact that he 
was youngest of three brothers, 
much alike. He needed women’s at- 
tention to reassure him about his 
own individuality. 

For a long moment Spartak didn’t 
reply. All he would have said would 
have amounted to the same as he 
had already repeated over and over. 
He knew of nothing that could be 
done without psychological assis- 
tance as skilled as what the Em- 
pire could draw on, and it couldn’t 
be obtained without putting the ship 
into space for some other friendlier 
world. And once in space, the com- 
pulsion would be far too strong to 
withstand. 

The pause gave Vix a chance to 
think of something else: Vineta was 
weeping silently in the corner of 
the control room, her face pale and 
drained of hope. Vix rounded on 
her. 

“Stop that snivelling, woman!” 
he blazed. “I can’t do anything about 
what’s happened, can I? Control 
yourself and stop crying as if I’d 
been beating you!” 

“Vix!” Spartak snapped. “You 
ought to stop taking your frustra- 
tion out on the poor girl! It can’t 
make much difference to her where 
you drag her away to. Nylock and 
Asconel are both meaningless noises 
to her. If she’s in tears it’s for your 
sake, not her own.” 

The cloud of gloom lifted momen- 
tarily from Vineta’s perfectly shaped 
features, and she found the energy 
for a sad smile of gratitude at the 
intervention. Beside himself, Vix re- 
torted, “I suppose you’re glad of 
this, are you? Glad we’re being 



sent to some back-of-beyond planet 
instead of to Asconel where we 
belong! There’s fighting there — 
or will be — and you have no 
stomach for it!” 

S partak clung grimly to the shreds 
of his own temper. The abstract 
principles inculcated in him on An- 
nan world, though, were very hard 
to apply under present circum- 
stances. 

“How long did yoij spend bur- 
rowing in your piles of stale knowl- 
edge?” Vix sneered. “Ten years, 
isn’t it? And does nothing you learn- 
ed in all that time tell you how — ” 
He was interrupted by a bang 
on the outer door of the lock. Hard- 
ly stopping to draw breath, he 
charged away on a new line of com- 
plaint: “Now our time’s up! They’ve 
brought this telepathic mutant along 
and the moment she’s aboard we’ve 
lost our last chance to figure out a 
way of staying on Delcadore and 
tracking down Tiorin!” 

The idea struck Spartak that hav- 
ing a mind-reader close to him 
frightened Vix as much as being 
sent far away from Asconel. Super- 
stition, merely? Or the fear of hav- 
ing some secret misdeed revealed? 
For himself, he knew he would wel- 
come thin consolation in this op- 
portunity to find out the truth be- 
hind all the rumors which he had 
heard; the policy of deportation 
which the Empire had instituted to 
insure itself against wild factors in 
the peoples it ruled by imposing 
statistical averages on them had 
worked well, but it had also fed the 
imaginations of the ignorant. 



34 



IF 




Still, right now the matter of the 
talents of the sports the human race 
had thrown up was irrelevant. He 
got to his feet. 

Somehow he wasn’t so sure as 
Vix that the mutant girl was waiting 
at the entrance. He would have ex- 
pected a call from the port controller 
and perhaps some triggering com- 
mand to reinforce the conditioning 
on their minds, not a simple knock 
without advance warning. 

He unlocked the panel and slid it 
aside. 

The person who met his gaze was 
a little man, apparently very ner- 
vous, with protruding teeth and wide 
startled eyes. He held tight to the 
guardrail around the narrow plat- 
form to which the ladder below him 
gave access, as though he was afraid 
of losing his balance and cashing 
to the ground. 

He said in a squeaky, eager voice, 
“Is this the ship from Asconel?” 

Spartak nodded, and the nervous 
man was infinitely relieved, even go- 
ing so far as to take one hand from 
the rail he clutched. 

“Please! May I come inside and 
discuss a proposition with you?” 

Spartak hesitated, then stepped 
back and gestured that the other 
should pass, him. Vix, from within 
the control room, called out fierce- 
ly to know what was going on. 

But the nervous man would not 
say anything further until he was 
safely in the control room himself. 
Then he drew himself up important- 

iy- 

“My name is not of any conse- 
quence,” he commenced. “It is in 
fact Rochard, but I am representing 



a — uh — a third party who is 
very desirous of securing passage to 
your planet. For some time he has 
had his agents making inquiries at 
all the spaceports on Delcadore, 
asking about ships from Asconel and 
nearby systems, offering a generous 
fee for a flight thither. Yours is the 
first such ship to come to my notice 
since I was requested to assist him.” 

Vix and Spartak exchanged asto- 
nished glances. Then the redhead 
pursed his lips as if to spit. 

“Can’t help him,” he snarled. 

Rochard put his hand suggestive- 
ly into his belt-pouch, and there was 
the mellow jingling noise of solid 
Imperial coin. He said, “I’m in- 
structed to make a very liberal pay- 
ment in advance, and then my — 
uh — principal will guarantee dou- 
ble the old commercial rate for the 
distance. You’d be well advised to 

j» 

“It’s nothing to do with money,” 
Vix broke in. His shoulders bowed, 
and he turned half away from Roch- 
ard. “Go look for some other ves- 
sel. If I could, I’d cheerfully take 
him to Asconel and not ask one cir- 
cle for the flight — that miserable 
world needs outsiders to visit it and 
view its present plight! But it’s out 
of the question.” 

B ewildered, Rochard renewed his 
original offer, his wide alarmed 
eyes seeking a clue to the refusal. 
Abruptly Vix whirled and clamped a 
hand on his wrist. 

“Out! Or I’ll throw you out. You 
can’t take no for an answer, can 
you? I guess you’re losing a fat bonus 
for finding us, hey? Well, have your 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



35 





argument with the woman who sits 
in the port control building yonder!” 
He added a vivid and obscene des- 
cription of her. 

“Just a second,” Spartak whisper- 
ed. His mind had been buzzing ever 
since Rochard’s entrance with a wild 
— fantastic — notion. Even now he 
was reluctant to utter it, but he felt 
he must. 

“This ‘principal’ of yours — he 
isn’t by some miracle a man called 
Tiorin of Asconel?” 

Rochard started. “Why, you know 
him!” he blurted. “How do you 
know him? I was forbidden to name 
him to anyone.” 

“Don’t you see a resemblance be- 
tween him and this man who holds 
your arm?” Spartak rapped. The 
success of his million-to-one probe 
had shaken him, physically, so that 

36 



he was now trembling with excite- 
ment. As for Vix, he was so startled 
he had completely forgotten to re- 
lease his hold on Rochard. 

“Why — I guess so. But there 
are many worlds where one genetic 
strain has dominated others and pro- 
duced a general likeness between 
many people.” 

“This is no accidental resem- 
blance. You’re looking at his full 
brother Vix. And I’m Spartak, his 
half-brother.” 

“Amazing!” Rochard breathed. 
“Why, for this he’ll pay me double 
— treble — ten times what he 
promised! Please let me go,” he 
added cringingly to Vix. “I must 
carry the news to him at once.” 

“It still won’t help much,” 
Spartak grunted, silencing a threat- 
ened interruption from Vix with a 

IF 




lift of his eyebrows. “We’ve been put 
under Imperial requisition, and con- 
ditioned to take a mutant girl to 
some place called Nylock. You must 
be well in touch with what goes on 
around here. What can we do to get 
out from under this?” 

Rochard’s face fell. He said, “Oh, 
no . The two words were like 
the sighing of wind through bushes 
in a cemetery. 

“Is there someone we can bribe 
to have' the conditioning reversed?” 
Spartak urged. “Is there anyone we 
could go to for counter-condition- 
ing?” 

“How about Tiorin himself?” Vix 
snapped. “What’s his situation here? 
How’s he fixed for contacts, govern- 
ment influence, things like that?” 
Rochard spoke so rapidly he was 
almost babbling, his gaze apparently 

THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



riveted on the imaginary spectacle 
of a fat reward disappearing into 
space. “Your brother is in no posi- 
tion to help you either! He’s not 
meant to be on Delcadore at all. 
You see, some short time ago there 
came a man from — I think — 
his own world, yours too of course, 
an assassin, from whom he barely 
escaped. Since then he’s been in 
hiding, and only some few trusted 
agents have been told he’s still here. 
For the sake of any more would-be 
killers, the news was passed that he 
had left for Argus to raise aid 
against the new rulers of Asconel.” 

“Do you know where he is? Can 
you contact him quickly?” Spartak 
demanded. 

“Why, within minutes if he’s at 
the usual place. But it may take a 
while to bring him to you. If you’re 

37 



X 



ujnder Imperial requisition you can’t 
leave the ship, and any attempt you 
make to communicate with people 
on the planet will be automatically 
jammed.” 

“Get hold of him at once any- 
way,” Spartak ordered. “It’s our only 
chance.” 

Frantically Rochard dashed for 
the door. 

Spartak turned to Vix, wiping 
sweat from his face. He said, “It 
might have taken weeks to track 
him down here. He might have fool- 
ed us, along with Bucyon’s assassins, 
and we’d have gone on a ridiculous 
chase to Argus looking for him. 
Even if we have to go home via 
Nylock, we may prove to have 
wasted amazingly little time.” 

“If we get back from Nylock,” 
Vix said. “If we get him aboard 
in time to make the trip with us, and 
the girl isn’t brought here before he 
arrives. If. If. 7/1” 

“I should have given Rochard a 
message to cover that risk,” Spar- 
tak whispered. “Told Tiorin to wait 
for us, and we’d be back to locate 
him right here.” 

“You were not expecting to find 
your brother on this world at all,” 
Vineta suggested unexpectedly. 
“You were prepared to find he had 
left for somewhere else.” 

Spartak nodded absently. 

“Then you are in luck,” she said 
with a shrug. “Try to look on that 
side of it. I wiM go fix refreshments 
against your brother’s arrival.” 

She slipped silently from the 
cabin, and the two men settled down 
to try and abide by her extremely 
sensible advice. 



I t seemed that a slow eternity pass- 
ed before they again heard a bang 
on the outer door. Vix leapt to his 
feet. 

“That must be the girl being 
brought!” he declared. “And we 
still haven’t heard from Tiorin!” he 
added nervously. 

“I don’t think so,” Spartak coun- 
tered, and now voiced the thought 
which had occurred to him earlier: 
that the port authorities would cer- 
tainly advise them of the girl’s ar- 
rival by communicator. He went to 
open the lock, and found Rochard 
had returned. 

“I wouldn’t have been so long,” 
the nervous man exclaimed, “but I 
thought it safer to try and reach 
you by communicator rather than 
come back. Only once you’re under 
Imperial requisition even the palms 
I can normally grease seem to be 
put back in their pockets. To the 
point, since I did have to come here 
again: your brother is on his way, 
and if you can delay your departure 
one more hour he’ll join you. Uh — 
I can’t help wondering,” he finish- 
ed in a fawning tone, “whether I 
may not have done you too some 
small service . .?” 

Spartak had been Isolated in the 
environment of his order on An- 
nanworld for so long that at first 
he did not get the point of this deli- 
cate probe for a gratuity. When he 
did, he found he was ignorant of 
the current purchasing power of 
Imperial money. He fumbled a 
twenty-circle piece from his pouch, 
and that seemed to satisfy Rochard; 



38 



II 




at any rate, he gave a mechanical 
smile and scampered down the lad- 
der again. 

“I wonder who he is,” Spartak 
murmured to Vix when he had re- 
layed Rochard’s news. 

“Him?” Vix shrugged. “He’s of a 
type which I’ve seen spring up on 
a dozen worlds. Carrion worms in- 
festing the gangrened body of the 
old Empire. Probably he’s regretting 
this instant that we’re not doing any- 
thing which would entitle him to a 
reward if he informed on us to the 
port authorities. That’s how people 
like him make a living: buying and 
selling information for use in black- 
mail, law evasion and petty crime 
in general.” 

“I thought he was a frightened 
fool when I first saw him,” Spar- 
tak admitted. “But he must be pret- 
ty astute.” 

“Astute? Him? He didn’t even try 
to find out if we were from Bucyon, 
like the assassin he told us about 
who came after Tiorin. He might 
have sold out his best employer and 
seen his throat out without reward 
to himself.” 

Spartak was briefly silent. Then 
he mentioned his unfamiliarity with 
the purchasing power of money now- 
adays, and added ruefully, “I think 
I’ve been too long away from real 
life, Vix!” 

“I could have been put away 
from it permanently, but for quick 
thinking on your part,” Vix retort- 
ed in a gruff tone. “At least we know 
we need only delay another hour, 
now. I hope they’re having trouble 
locating this mutant girl and bring- 
ing her to us.” 



B ut barely half the hoped-for 
period had gone by when the 
communicator barked at them. 

“Vix of Asconel, come to the 
port control building. Your passen- 
ger under requisition is here.” 

Vix and Spartak exchanged 
glances that promised determination 
to resist, and sat tight, their mouths 
clamped shut on the temptation to 
answer and comply. 

After a second peremptory order, 
however, there was a noise from be- 
low, and Vix jumped up. 

“Vineta!” he exclaimed. “The 
conditioning is on her too, isn’t it?” 
Spartak nodded. “Is she trying 
to get out of the lock?” 

“No, it doesn’t sound like it.” 
Vix went to the door to peer out 
“No, she’s coming here!” 

The girl’s face was pearled with 
sweat, and her teeth were chattering. 
“Vix, you must shut me in the 
cabin!” she forced out. “Or else 
I cannot stay against the orders I 
can hear!” 

“Hear?” Vix rapped. 

She nodded. “Like a little voice 
in my own head, whispering all the 
time.” 

“It’s a good idea to lock her in,” 
Spartak confirmed. “I wish there 
was some way we could lock all of 
us in. Is there?” 

“Not that I know of,” Vix grunt- 
ed. “Sooner or later, even if we clos- 
ed everything fast, we’d be driven 
to operating the emergency escape 
hatches, which can’t be locked.” 

He did as Vineta had asked, and 
on his return put a question to Spar- 
tak. “Little voices inside the head 
— is that how it feels to you?” 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



39 




Spartak shook his head. He 
answered loudly as another, now 
puzzled, command came over the 
communicator, trying to drown out 
the words with his own. “It affects 
different people dfferent ways, I’m 
told. It gives me a helpless tight- 
ness in the guts, makes my mouth 
dry and I think eventually it will 
blur my vision.” 

“How long before it gets unbear- 
able?” 

“I don’t know. How strong are 
we?” 

B ut the authorities* patience was 
shorter than their endurance. 
With ten minutes still to go before 
the promised time of Tiorin’s ar- 
rival, there came a thunderous bang- 
ing on the lock door, entirely dif- 
ferent from Rochard’s timid knock. 

“Tiorin?” whispered Vix, whose 
neck was now corded with tension 
as he struggled against the invisible 
compulsion to leave the ship and 
fetch their unwanted passenger. 

“I guess it could be,” Spartak re- 
plied with difficulty. “I’d better go 
see. I think I know more about 
what’s been done to us than you do. 
I stand a marginally better cha'nce 
of arguing for a while longer if it’s 
not Tiorin down there.” 

“Go ahead,” Vix consented, and 
his face twisted with self-contempt 
at his own frailty. 

It was not Tiorin. It was the pudgy 
woman with gray hair, accompanied 
by a squad of uniformed guards and 
the mutant girl — presumably — 
laid out on a stretcher on the back 
of the groundcar in which they had 
all ridden over to the ship. 



“You there!” she roared at Spar- 
tak’s appearance. “If you fight our 
conditioning much longer, you won’t 
be in a state to fly space! If that’s 
how you think you’re going to evade 
my orders, I tell you straight you 
won’t get away with it! I’ll condition 
one of my own pilots and drag you 
out to jail, and Delcadore will be 
the only planet you see for the rest 
of your lives!” 

A cloud of formless terror due to 
the conditioning enveloped Spartak’s 
brain. He was unable to speak. Ignor- 
ing him, the woman turned to the 
guards with her. 

“Get that girl off the car and 
put her aboard!” 

Slowly, the terror retreated as 
Spartak called on every trick of self- 
discipline taught him on Annan- 
world. He found his voice again, 
could see clearly as the guards awk- 
wardly sought to get the girl-laden 
stretcher up the ladder to the lock at 
which he stood. 

A shocking possibility crossed his 
mind, and everything else, condition- 
ing included, fled from his aware- 
ness. 

He leaned forward on the rail, 
peering down at the girl. From her 
face, and the slightness of the body 
under the blanket in which she was 
wrapped, he deduced that she was 
scarcely more than a child — fifteen 
or sixteen, perhaps. 

But that wasn’t what transfixed 
him. He had assumed her to be un- 
conscious, perhaps injured by the 
peasants or whoever had tried to 
stone her to death. The gray-haired 
woman had mentioned something 
about that. However, he had seen 



40 



IF 




without a shadow of doubt that her 
eyes were open. 

“What’s wrong with that girl?” 

The guards, busy trying to get her 
up the ladder, didn’t answer. The 
woman on the car merely scowled. 

Behind him in the lock, Vix ap- 
peared, clutching his gun but some- 
how unable to find the trigger, so 
that his hands wandered absurdly 
over the stock and barrel, like joint- 
ed insects with minds of their own. 

“Is she sick, or hurt?” he in- 
quired feverishly. 

“I don’t think so,” Spartak rapped. 

“Get back!” — from one of the 
guards manhandling the stretcher 
up to them. Despite himself, Vix 
obeyed instantly. Spartak heard him 
cursing under his breath. 

The stretcher grated over the edge 
of the platform and was slammed 
flat. Blue eyes in a face which would 
normally have been ruddy and 
healthy, but had turned sallow, 
stared at the sky, not even turning 
to see into whose care she had 
been committed. 

“Catatone!” Spartak thundered, 
and rage so great it overcame the 
force of the conditioning stormed in- 
to his limbs. 

“What did you say?” Vix cried. 

“She’s under catatone! It’s a 
paralyzant — they first got it from 
the poison of the Louder ichneu- 
mon.” He stamped to the guardrail 
and stared down at the gray-haired 
woman. 

“Correct!” she applauded mock- 
ingly. 

Vix plucked at his arm. “Isn’t it 
as well?” he whispered. “After all, 
to have her — ” 



Spartak brushed aside the other’s 
hand. “It’s the cruellest thing in the 
galaxy!” he blazed. “Because k 
only paralyses! It doesn’t dull painl 
How’d you like to be unable even 
to moisten your eyes by blinking — • 
or move to relieve a cramped leg 
— or control your bowels?” 

He heard Vix draw his breath 
in sharply, and from the corner of 
his eye saw that the > redhead was 
staring with dismay at the girl’s taut 
body. 

“And don’t you know why they 
did it?” Spartak raged on. “Because 
there’s so much lying and deceit 
going on in this once-proud Empire 
they’re afraid a mind-reader could 
tell a few unpleasant truths to the 
people they’re duping — like the 
man we met earlier, shy of his arm 
and his leg!” 

He saw, as clearly as through a 
telescope, that his taunt had made 
the gray-haired woman wince. With- 
out conscious intent, he shot out 
his arm and seized the energy gun 
from Vix’s fumbling grasp. Trying 
desperately to stretch this moment 
of not-thinking to its utmost, he 
levelled the weapon and found the 
trigger. 

“Where’s the antidote?” he shout- 
ed. “Get me the antidote or I’ll 
burn you where you sit!” 

There was a dreadful silence. In- 
credulous, the guards turned at the 
foot of the ladder and stared up at 
him, shaking with the effort of keep- 
ing the gun sighted on the gray- 
haired woman, but somehow finding 
the resources to go on. 

“We — we haven’t got it!” the 
woman quavered. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



41 




“Then get it!” Spartak told her. 
“No, not you! You’re my hostage. 
Send one of these bullyboys for it. 
And tell him to run both ways!” 
Vix put his hands on the guard- 
rail, clamping them till the knuckles 
were white. Seeming to draw 
strength from his brother’s example, 
he cried, “And tell that man below 
not to pull any tricks — I saw him 
move for his sidearm!” 

The guard who had tried to get at 
his gun jerked his hand back from 
his waist, holding It out at his side. 

“Hurry!” Spartak rasped. “Your 
conditioning is good. I might decide 
I have to give in — but I’ll burn 
you first!” 

The woman shrieked terrified or- 
ders, and the guards broke as one 
to dash back to the port control 
building and fetch what was requir- 
ed. 

T he time that passed now was 
hardly human-scaled, inside 
Spartak’s overstrained mind. It was 
time slow enough to suit the growth 
of galaxies, the cooling of suns. Yet 
there was nothing in all of space 
except a frightened fat woman on 
a ridiculous little groundcar, trem- 
bling as the gun stayed aligned with 
her head. 

Could he endure? His guts were 
chilled with nausea; his vision was 
swimming and there were random, 
insane noises in his ears. The metal 
of the gun seemed alternately burn- 
ing hot and freezing cold, and often 
he had the illusion that — like Vix 
— he was not gripping the trigger, 
but fumbling in front of and behind 
it. 



“There he comes!” Vix said. He 
pointed, but Spartak dared not lode 
away from the sole focus of his at- 
tention. 

“Let him bring it up,” he breath- 
ed. “Put it alongside the girl’s 
head.” - 

“Bring what up?” Vix glanced at 
him in wonder and not a little ad- 
miration. “Oh! Not the guard com- 
ing back — but Tiorin! I can see 
his red hair plainly!” 

“I don’t care about Tiorin,” Spar- 
tak said. A vague puzzlement flash- 
ed across his mind: he did care 
really, didn’t he? Only somehow 
it was less important than the main 
purpose, the bringing of the antidote 
for catatone . 

“Spartak, listen to me,” Vix was 
saying out of infinite distance. 
“Spartak, Tiorin is here — he’s come 
up to the lock and brought the anti- 
dote with him. I told the gaurd to 
give it to him and here he is and 
he’s brought it. You can put down 
the gun and we can leave.” 

Spartak’s temporary universe, 
containing only himself, the gun and 
its target, crumbled, and utter dark- 
ness overwhelmed him. 

XI 

T wo blurred faces topped with 
red hair swam in Spartak’s un- 
focused vision. He struggled to 
bring the images into register with 
one another. The effort made his 
eyes hurt. He gave up, and only then 
discovered that there were two faces 
in reality, not merely in his imagi- 
nation. One of them belonged to 
Vix. But the other — 



42 



IF 




Of course. Tiorin! Memory came 
Hooding back, and he was able to 
force himself up on his elbows. He 
was lying on one of the bunks in 
the upper cabin, and both his broth- 
ers were leaning over him with ex- 
pressions of concern. 

“Spartak?” Tiorin said doubtfully. 
“How do you feel?” 

Thoughtfully Spartak took stock 
of his body and still more of his 
bruised mind. He said evenutally, 
“Bad. But I’ll survive.” 

“By the moons of Argus, it’s a 
miracle,” Vix declared. “I shall 
never know till my dying day how 
you managed to keep that gun on its 
target. I had something like that in 
mind, but I couldn’t control my 
hands under the conditioning.” 
“They’re alleged to know a good 
many things on Annanworld which 
have been forgotten elsewhere in 
the galaxy,” Tiorin said. “Where’s 
that jug of broth your girl brought? 
Oh, there. Give some of it to Spar- 
tak — it’ll help to restore his 
strength.” 

Vix carefully set the spout of the 
jug to Spartak’s lips, his other arm 
serving as a prop behind the younger 
man’s shoulders. Spartak sipped and 
sipped again; the broth was hot and 
spicy, and he thought he detected 
the faint flavor of some energy con- 
centrate under the masking tastes. 

Meantime, he had a chance to 
look at Tiorin, whom he had not 
seen since the day of Hodat’s ac- 
cession to the Warden’s chair. 

His second brother had aged 
noticeably. He would in fact be — 
Spartak calculated rapidly — forty- 
one, which in the heyday of galac- 



tic civilization had been youth, not 
early middle age. But the extreme 
wealth of the Empire was needed to 
support freely available geriatric 
treatment. Now, and for the fore- 
seeable future, only those fortunate 
enough to inhabit secure planets like 
Annanworld would enjoy the old 
benefits. He had a passing vision 
of peasants grubbing on decadent 
worlds, mating in their teens, the 
women worn out by childbirth at 
age thirty. It was not a pleasant idea, 
and Spartak spoke hostily to distract 
his mind. 

“Tiorin, it’s incredible that we 
should have located you!” 

“Not really.” Even Tiorin’s voice 
had changed from what Spartak re- 
called: grown deeper and become 
colored with a sort of drawl to 
suggest that he weighed every single 
word. “I’ve been explaining to Vix 
how it happened. Right now, he 
tells me, you’re feeling very annoy- 
ed at the pretensions of the rump 
of the Empire. But it saved my life 
by still possessing some of the old 
advantages — an efficient law- 
force, swift communications ... It 
was no secret that I was second son 
to the former Warden of Asconei, 
you see. I’d found it helpful to 
draw on the small prestige this con- 
ferred. And when Bucyon’s assassin 
arrived, and started asking rather 
too freely where he could find me, 
some inspired official grew alarmed. 
He sent a warning to me, and we 
laid a trap for the would-be killer. 
It was from him that I learned about 
this hellish cult Bueyon has import- 
ed, and also of course about the 
death of our brother Hodat.” 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

A shadow crossed his premature- 
ly lined face. 

“Accordingly, I had it noised 
about that I’d gone to beg Imperial 
aid in the deposition of the usurper 
at the court of Argus.” 

“I still don’t see why you didn’t,” 
Vix muttered. 

“You of all people should know,” 
Tiorin retorted. “Holding what it 
has is beyond the Empire’s power 
now. Whole fleets are rebelling and 
setting up on their own. What 
chance would I have had of securing 
aid except on terms that would be 
ruinous to Asconel? Do you know 
what price the old Twenty-Seventh 
Fleet set for their return to Im- 
perial jurisdiction? You, Spartak?” 
On receiving headshakes, he con- 
cluded, “The free right to sack the 
planet Norge!” 

S partak, shocked beyond measure, 
pushed aside the empty jug of 
broth. “But Norge was one of the 
last Imperial outposts beyond Del- 
cadore!” 

“Still is. The price was refused. 
But the point is: the price was set. 
I’d have had to promise something 
similar in respect of Asconel, and 
I wouldn’t have had the heart.” 
Tiorin scowled. “No. it seemed to 
me that my only hope was to ex- 
ploit my inborn capital as Hodat’s 
legal heir. That’s why I hired agents 
to inform me of the arrival of any 
ship from Asconel. I was afraid the 
most likely occupants of such a ship 
would be more assassins, out to 
complete the job I’d once frustrated, 
but by good luck yours was the first 
vessel to reach Delcadore.” 



“You’re relying on your appeal 
to the citizens to make them rise 
up in support of you against Bucy- 
on?” Spartak suggested. 

“So are you, I gather,” Tiorin 
countered. 

Spartak shook his head heavily. 
He said, “I talked with Korisu, the 
man Bucyon sent to murder Vix — 
and of course myself as well if 
possible. My judgment is that if 
Bucyon has contrived to turn a 
once-loyal citizen of Asconel into 
a fanatic supporter of ' his regime 
and his cult, it’s going to take more 
than simply fomenting a counter- 
revolution to set our planet free.” 

There was a depressed pause. Vix 
broke it with his habitual intoler- 
ance of extended silence. “We’re go- 
ing to have all the time in the galaxy 
to work out our plans,” he grunted. 
“Once you dropped that gun and 
keeled over, Spartak, the condition- 
ing took hold on me, and I had — • 
had — to get to the controls and 
set our course for this planet Ny- 
lock. And we’re well on the way 
there now.” 

“The girl!” Spartak said, and 
swung his feet to the floor. “Did you 
give her the antidote?” 

“We thought we’d better not,” 
Tiorin admitted. “Obviously you 
knew something about medicine in 
general and catatone in particular, 
and I’m afraid I’ve learned little 
about anything in the years we’ve 
been apart. I’ve gone on indulging 
myself.” 

“Wise of you, I guess, but . .” 
Spartak stood up, swaying, and had 
to close his eyes briefly as empathic 
agony stabbed him at the thought of 



44 



IF 




the torment the mutant girl was 
undergoing. “Where is she?” 

“I told Vineta to make her com- 
fortable in the other cabin,” Vix 
muttered. 

Spartak hesitated. Then he spoke 
his mind, as his training on Annan- 
world had accustomed him to do. 
“Listen, Vix! It’s painfully obvious 
that you hate the idea of having a 
mind-reader aboard. I guess you’d 
rather leave her the way the Em- 
pire liked to have her — incapable 
of speech, so she can’t give away 
any secrets she picks up. But mu- 
tant or not she’s a human being, and 
sheer chance decreed that she should 
be gifted with abnormal talents 
rather than you or I or Tiorin. If 
she’s survived into her teens, she’s 
bound to have learned discretion 
and foresight. She won’t blab the 
things you want to keep private.” 
“I hope not,” Vix shrugged. But 
he seemed ashamed of himself, and 
turned away without comment. 

“Here’s the phial of antidote,” 
Tiorin said, fumbling in his belt- 
pouch. “I hope it’s the real stuff, not 
some fake they palmed off on us 
to make us leave the planet.” 

“We’ll soon find out,” Spartak 
answered grimly. 

V ineta looked up, startled, as he 
entered the lower cabin, then 
gave him one of her quick shy smiles. 
He nodded in response before drop- 
ping to his knees alongside the mu- 
tant girl and reaching for his medi- 
cal case. 

“She doesn’t move at all!” Vineta 
exclaimed. “She is alive, isn’t she? 
But how does she breathe?” 



It was an astute question. Not for 
the first time Spartak found him- 
self suspecting that this self-effacing 
girl was the exact opposite of Vix: 
where he talked much and thought 
rather too little, she probably 
thought a great deal despite speak- 
ing very seldom. 

“You haven’t looked under this 
covering?” he suggested. 

Vineta nodded. “She’s clothed in 
some thick garment. I couldn’t see 
how it fastened, so I left it.” 

Spartak drew the blanket aside. 
The girl’s body was revealed com- 
pletely enclosed in a suit that glis- 
tened as if wet. A bulging hump 
showed across her bosom; another 
made her belly rise as though she 
were pregnant. 

“Yes, I’ve seen that technique be- 
fore,” he said — more to himself 
than Vineta. “Turn her head on 
the side, please. I shall have to put 
the antidote into the neck arteries; 
if I take the suit off she’ll suffocate 
before I save her.” 

If Tiorin* s ghastly suspicion is 
correct , she’ll die anyway . But 
he drove down that thought and ad- 
ministered the antidote with deft 
fingers. 

Seconds dragged away like hours 
— and she moved. 

Spartak realized he had been hold- 
ing his breath; he exhaled gustily. 
“Now we must get the suit off, 
quickly. See, it fastens on the shoul- 
ders and at the hips. Open that side.” 

With a sucking noise the wet-look- 
ing material let go. The skin reveal- 
ed was pallid and unhealthy, some- 
what swollen with accumulated 
fluids. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

“That’s how she breathed — see?” 
he explained, as the mound on her 
bosom was exposed, and proved to 
be a machine in a metal casing. 
“That drives air in and out and 
acts as a pacemaker for her heart. 
And this — ” the similar device on 
her belly — “takes care of bodily 
wastes. But not very well.” 

Now the mutant girl had suffi- 
ciently recovered for an expression 
to come to her face, and at the 
sight of it Vineta could not stifle an 
exclamation of horror. It was the 
worst look of pain Spartak had even 
seen. 

“Can you do massage?” he de- 
manded, stacking the prosthetic ma- 
chines all anyhow on a handy shelf. 
“Space knows how long she’s been 
kept from moving — the return of 
normal sensation will be pure tor- 
ture!” 

Vineta’s hands flew to the pale 
stiff limbs and began to rub. 

4 4 r "P'hank you.” The words came 
A on breath alone, barely au- 
dible. “Thank you. You can stop 
now. The pain’s gone.” 

Spartak sat back, exhausted, and 
stared at the girl. “Are you sure?” 
“Quite sure.” A sharp tongue 
slipped out to moisten her lips, 
which were chapped. “You are 
Spartak, yes? And you are Vineta?” 
Spartak’s eyebrows drew together. 
So far as he could recall, he hadn’t 
addressed Vineta by name, nor been 
addressed, since entering the cabin. 
He said, “Did you read our names 
from our minds?” 

A smile came and went on the 
mutant girl’s face. She said, a trifle 



louder as her vocal cords came un- 
der control, “Yes. And it feels very 
good. I have felt so much fear in 
people who knew what I am, but 
in your mind I feel — what to call 
it? Curiosity, I think. And in hers 
much kindness. I am so glad to be 
here.” 

“Then you also know what’s go- 
ing to happen to you?” Spartak sug- 
gested. 

“Yes. And I see why you ask. 
Frankly, I don’t care where I go 
so long as it’s away from — from the 
past.” The small sharp-featured face 
clouded. 

“I’ll let you rest now,” Spartak 
said. “Vineta, perhaps you should 
bring her some of that broth you 
made for me. It seems to have 
brought about my recovery from 
shock very quickly.” A point struck 
him, and went unvoiced by deliber- 
ate decision as his eyes returned to 
the mutant girl. 

She gave a thin chuckle. “My 
name’s Eunora,” she said. “You 
have a clear mind, Spartak. It’s like 
looking into a deep transparent pool 
of pure water, and I can see all 
the way to the rocks at the bottom 
except in one place. And that’s 
where you’ve been conditioned to 
take me to Nylock.” 

“I imagine,” Spartak said with dif- 
ficulty, “that you can make allow- 
ances for my brothers. I don’t think 
they feel as I do about — about 
people like you.” 

“No, I can sense them. Just bare- 
ly.” Eunora shut her eyes and 
seemed to be listening to distant 
noises. “They are both full of re- 
sentment. The conditioning lies on 



46 



IF 




all their thoughts like dense fog, and 
one of them can’t help thinking that 
I’m responsible for the delay in your 
mission.” 

After that, silence. Spartak caught 
Vineta’s eye and nodded her out 
of the cabin. Then he went, heavy- 
hearted to rejoin his brothers. 

XII 

T he two others had gone up to 
the control room again. As he 
approached the door, he heard Vix’s 
voice raised. 

“Well, I know Spartak’s views on 
this, because he told me.” 

“And they are — ?” Tiorin prompt- 
ed. 

“That we might have spent 
months hunting you, maybe going 
clear to Argus on the false trail you 
laid, so we should be glad our only 
delay is this little side trip to Ny- 
lock” 

“Suitably philosophical, I guess,” 
Tiorin replied as Spartak paused 
outside the door, “for someone who 
took vows to an order on Annan- 
world. It’s a hotbed of philosophy, 
I’m told. For my part, I agree with 
you. If luck runs your way you 
ought to grab its tail and hang on 
tight! Is there no means whereby we 
could get around the conditioning 
imposed on you? I’m not condi- 
tioned. Could you give me a course 
of instruction and let me fly the 
ship to Asconel?” 

“No, for two reasons.” Spartak 
slid the door aside and stepped into 
their view. “First, conditioning of 
this order of efficiency turns your 
own mind against your wishes. If 



Vix were to try and teach you how 
to pilot the ship, he’d so instruct 
you as to insure that you set course 
for where we’re commanded to go. 
Or, if by some miracle he avoided 
that trap, he and I and probably Vin- 
eta would conspire to take the con- 
trols away from you again. And sec- 
ondly, even if you did succeed in 
getting us to Asconel, we’d arrive 
there in the sort of state I was in 
when they finally brought the anti- 
dote for Eunora. Only worse. The 
strain might literally kill us; I’d 
certainly expect us to be incurably 
insane.” 

“The girl!” Reminded of his other 
omnipresent anxiety, Vix tensed. 
“Did you — uh — cure her?” 

“And what was the name you 
used?” Tiorin added. 

“Eunora.” Spartak combed at his 
beard with agitated fingers. “I guess 
you could . say she’s cured. She’s 
released from the paralysis, at least. 
But I’m astonished at how normal 
and level-headed she seems. It’s not 
what you’d expect from someone of 
her age — still very young — treated in 
such an abominable fashion.” He 
paused and frowned. “Oh — may- 
be I’m being overly suspicious. May- 
be she’s just so glad to get free of 
the Imperials and the people who 
were apt to stone her . .” 

“Is that what they were going to 
do?” Tiorin exclaimed. 

“So we were told by that fat old 
fool at the spaceport on Delca- 
dore,” Vix confirmed. “Well, we 
have to make the most of our 
chances such as they are. Spartak, 
when you came in we were discuss- 
ing how to tackle the problem. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



47 





Tiorin has unconfirmed reports of 
a center of resistance established by 
Tigrid Zen on Gwo.” 

“How old are the reports?” Spar- 
tak asked sourly. “Gwo is too close 
and too obvious for Bucyon to over- 
look it.” He had been taken to Gwo 
once, and never forgotten the im- 
pression it made on him; marginally 
habitable, it served Asconel and five 
or six neighboring systems as a 
source of raw materials, the far 
greater distance for transport as 
compared with asteroids in their 
own systems being counterbalanced 
by the extra convenience of work- 
ing with breathable atmosphere. It 
was a bleak, oppressive world, its 
vegetation drab olive and gray, its 
climate wet and windy, its oceans 
perpetually tossed by storms. 

The point apparently hadn’t oc- 



curred to Vix. He glanced at Tiorin. 
“Is this something you had from 
Bucyon’s assassin?” 

Tiorin nodded. “But I did confirm 
the story by checking with the crews 
of ships that had recently passed 
within earshot, so to speak, of As- 
conel. There’s a spaceman’s slang 
term for that; what is it?” 

“Rumor-range,” Spartak answered 
shortly. “Four kinds of news: 
standing there, landing there, rumor- 
range and rubbish.” 

Vix gave a humorless chuckle. 
“I’m surprised at you knowing that, 
not ever having been a spaceman 
yourself.” 

Spartak made a gesture of dismis- 
sal, dropping into a seat. “Speaking 
of Bucyon’s assassin reminded me 
Your tracks may be fairly well cov- 
ered on Delcadore, Tiorin — though 



48 



IF 




after meeting Rochard, I’m not so 
sure of that. Ours certainly are not. 
The most casual inquiry on Annan- 
world would give a lead of Vix and 
me. And Bucyon is hardly likely to 
rest content with the triple frustra- 
tion of his attempts at wiping us out. 
Indeed, I’m amazed he relied on lone 
agents. In his position, I’d stop at 
nothing to get rid of all of us.” 
Tiorin nodded, his face grave. 
“The impression I had from the in- 
terrogation of the man sent to kill 
me was that fanatics deluded by the 
cult of Belizuek acquire the illu- 
sion of being invincible, capable of 
undertaking any mission singlehand- 
ed. But I grant that this isn’t an im- 
pression apt to survive a succession 
of setbacks like the ones luck has 
brought us up to now.” 

“Fanatics are tricky to handle,” 

THE ALTAR AT ASCOKEL 



Spartak muttered. “If you catch 
them on their blind side — say by do- 
ing something they define as impos- 
sible — you can cope with them eas- 
ily. If you stand in their way as we 
must stand in Bucyon’s ... Or do 
we?” 

“What do you mean?” Vix 
snapped. Then a light seemed to 
dawn on him. “Oh! Do you mean 
that this errand to dump the mutant 
girl is something of Bucyon’s do- 
ing?” 

“A means of getting us out of 
the way? I doubt it. Even Bucyon 
could hardly organize a chain of 
coincidences like that. No, what I 
mean is this: if he’s managed to in- 
spire dupes like Korisu and the man 
sent to kill Tiorin, if he’s reduced the 
citizens to a state of blind adoration, 
he may feel secure without disposing 

49 





of us. He may wait for us to come 
home, frantic with rage, and then 
pick us off at his own convenience.” 
Vix’s face darkened. “By the 
moons of Argus, I’d like to test that 
idea! I’d like to set course now for 
Asconel and pitch Bucyon and his 
woman Lydis from the top of the 
Dragon’s Fangs — ach\” 

The last sound was not a word, 
but a gasp of agony, and he doubled 
over. Alarmed, Spartak jolted up 
from his seat, but Vix waved him 
back. 

4 4Qecond time that’s happened,” 
O the redhead wheezed. “If I 
so much as think about going 
straight to Asconel, I get a griping 
in the guts, but if I speak it out 
loud, it’s like molten metal being 
poured into my belly.” 

“It’s the conditioning,” Tiorin 
said. “It must be.” 

Spartak nodded. “Think about 
Nylock,” he urged Vix. “Think 
about going to Asconel after we’ve 
left the mutant girl behind. It’ll calm 
you and you’ll be eased.” 

“Go on talking on those lines,” 
Vix whispered. The whole of his 
face had paled to the whiteness of 
his long scar. 

“Uh — yes.” Spartak turned to 
Tiorin. “Well, the simple plan is to 
link up with the rebels. If any. As 
a starter.” 

Tiorin scowled. “We have the 
mystique of our blood to draw sup- 
port, descended as we are from the 
Warden who steered Asconel through 
the storms which followed the col- 
lapse of Argian influence in our sec- 
tor of the galaxy. That might tip the 



scales in our favor. But after our- 
selves, I know no one more likely 
to rally resistance to Bucyon than 
Tigrid Zen, and if he’s failed . .” 
He shrugged despondently. 

“We’re guessing,” Spartak said 
angrily. “What we need to do is 
make straight for Asconel — contact 
Tigrid Zen if we can, but not chasing 
him if he’s gone hunting sup- 
port in some other system. Then 
on Asconel, perhaps disguised, we 
ought to — ” 

He broke off. Tiorin was gazing 
at him queerly. 

“What is it?” he demanded. 

“You just said ‘make straight for 
Asconel’,” Tiorin exclaimed. “And 
nothing happened to you! When Vix 
said the same thing, more or less, he 
doubled up in pain.” 

Blank, Spartak tried it again. “We 
should make straight for Asconel. I 
want to go straight there now. I 
intend to go straight there now” 

He jumped to his feet. “By the 
moons of Argus, you’re right! Vix, 
try it!” 

“I — !” Vix moistened his lips and 
gathered his courage, fearing an- 
other blast of the torture which had 
overcome him moments earlier. “I 
want to go to Asconel. Now.” 

And slowly a smile replaced his 
look of anxiety. 

“The conditioning’s failed!” Tiorin 
exploded. “It must have been badly 
implanted — ” 

“No!” Spartak rapped. “I felt 
it, and believe me. I know. The 
psychologists who treated us knew 
their job. Either we’re suffering from 
a delusion, implanted as a second 
line of defense against the break- 



50 



IF 




down of the main commands, or — 
No, that can’t be right. We have 
you as a control, Tiorin; you’re not 
conditioned, and you’d observe that. 
Then that leaves one single possibil- 
ity, and I think I know what it is.” 

“Tell us!” cried. Vix, almost be- 
side himself with joy at being unex- 
pectedly released from his invisible 
bonds. 

“Eunora,” Spartak said. 

“What? The mind-reading girl?” 
Vix took half a pace back as though 
recoiling from a physical shock. 
“But— how?” 

“I don’t pretend to know that,” 
Spartak said. “I’m just eliminating 
the things I know to be out of the 
question, and I find one unknown 
factor operating. Let’s go see her 
and find out.” 

“That won’t be necessary,” a soft 
voice said, and the panel of the door 
slid aside to reveal Eunora herself. 

Spartak had not realized till this 
moment how tiny she actually was. 
She barely came to Vix’s elbow, 
and he was the shortest of the three 
men. She had borrowed one of the 
costumes he had seen in Vineta’s 
closet when he boarded the ship on 
Annanworld, and it hung loosely on 
her as though she were a child dress- 
ing up in her mother’s clothes. 

“Eunora! Did you take the condi- 
tioning off us?” Spartak blurted. 

The girl gave a grave nod. 

“Then I can’t begin to tell you 
how grateful we are!” 

“That’s right!” Vix confirmed. 
His face was alight with enthusiasm. 
“Why, you may have saved a whole 
planet’s people by saving us that 
trip to Nylock!” 



Eunora didn’t answer at once. 
She walked into the control room 
with careful, mincing steps, seem- 
ing still to be finding out how her 
unparalyzed legs should support her. 
Behind her, a trifle nervous, but 
looking calm enough, came Vineta, 
who had presumably tried to dis- 
suade her from leaving her cabin 
and failed. 

“I didn’t know about this — this 
conditioning ” the mutant girl said 
at last. “It was only when I felt the 
pain and twisting in your mind — ” 
nodding to Vix — “that I decided I 
had to find out about it. It’s . , . 
interesting.” 

A nameless premonition filled the 
air. 

“It’s difficult being a mutant,” the 
soft voice went on. “Hardly daring 
to use the gift — afraid all the time 
that it will leak out and then there’ll 
be . killing. But it’s grown with- 
out my noticing. I have more talents 
than I ever realized. I was able to 
work on your minds like a lock- 
smith picking locks, locating and re- 
leasing all the implanted orders.” 
She gave a little crazy giggle. “And 
when you see how it’s done, it’s so 
simple!” 

Spartak’s whole body had gone 
cold as ice. He waited numbly, for 
her to make the point which he 
foresaw with terror. 

“Asconel. That’s where you 
want to go. But I don’t think I like 
the idea much. It’s an Imperial 
world — or was. So they don’t tolerate 
my kind of people. Also it’s going 
to be a place of fighting. I can see 
that in your mind, Vix. You want

to go mere and fight against these 
priests and this man called Bucyon, 
and because you’re so frightened of 
having your mind probed you’ll 
probably be glad if something bad 
happens to me. Spartak perhaps not. 
I don’t know. But even he . 

She hesitated. Then she giggled 
again. “Well, I’ve found out about 
conditioning now. I see how it’s 
done. I think I can probably make 



you do what I want. There’s only 
one question that remains: it’s such 
a big galaxy, so where shall I make 
you take me?” 

She looked around her petrified 
audience with mocking eyes. “Go 
on!” she urged. “Think of the other 
places I might like to be taken — any- 
where but Asconel or back where I 
came from — and then I’ll make you 
pilot me there!”

IF • Short Story 



What T and I Did 



' am a decent human being . But 
hat T — don't trust him, evert 



M y first awareness is of location. 

I am in a large conical room 
inside some vast vehicle, hurling 
through space. The world is familiar 
to me, though I am new. 

“He’s awake!” says a black-haired 
young woman, watching me with 
frightened eyes. Half a dozen people 
in disheveled clothing, the three 
men long unshaven, gather slowly in 
my field of vision. 

My field of vision? My left hand 
comes up to feel about my face, 
and its fingers find my left eye 
covered with a patch. 

“Don’t disturb that!” says the 
tallest of the men. Probably he was 
once a distinguished figure. He 
speaks sharply, yet his manner is 
different, as if I am a person of im- 
portance. But I am only — who? 

“What’s happened?” I ask. My 
tongue has trouble finding even the 
simplest words. My right arm lies 
at my side as if forgotten, but it 
stirs at my thought, and with its 
help I raise myself to a sitting posi- 
tion, provoking an onrush of pain 
through my head, and dizziness. 



Two of the women backed away 
from me. A stout young man puts a 
protective arm around each of them. 
These people are familiar to me, 
but I cannot find their names. 

“You’d better take it easy,” says 
the tallest man. His hands, a doc- 
tor’s, touch my head and my pulse, 
and ease me back onto the padded 
table. 

Now I see that two tall human- 
oid robots stand flanking me. I ex- 
pect that at any moment the doctor 
will order them to wheel me away 
to my hospital room. Still, I know 
better; this is no hospital. The truth 
will be terrible when I remember it. 

“How do you feel?” asks the third 
man, an oldster, coming forward 
to bend over me. 

“All right. I guess.” My speech 
comes only in poor fragments. 
“What’s happened?” 

“There was a battle,” says the 
doctor. “You were hurt, but I’ve 
saved your life.” 

“Well. Good.” My pain and diz- 
ziness are subsiding. 

In a satisfied tone the doctor says: 



53 



“It’s to be expected that you’ll have 
difficulty speaking. Here, try to 
read this.” 

He holds up a card, marked with 
neat rows of what I suppose are 
letters or numerals. I see plainly the 
shapes of the symbols, but they 
mean nothing to me, nothing at all. 

“No,” I say finally, closing my 
eye and lying back. I feel plainly 
that everyone is hostile to me. 
Why? I persist: “What’s happened?” 

TTe’re all prisoners, here in- 
▼ ▼ side the machine,” says the 
old man’s voice. “Do you remember 
that much?” 

“Yes.” I nod, remembering. But 
details are very hazy. “My name?” 
I ask. The old man chuckles drily, 
sounding relieved. “Why not Thad 
— for Thaddeus?” 

“Thad?” questions the doctor. I 
open my eye again. Power and con- 
fidence are growing in the doctor; 
because of something I have done, 
or have not done? “Your name is 
Thad,” he tells me. 

“We’re prisoners?” I question him. 
“Of a machine?” 

“Of a berserker machine.” He 
sighs. “Does that mean anything to 
you?” 

Deep in my mind, it means some- 
thing that will not bear looking at. 
I am spared; I sleep. 

When I awake again, I feel 
stronger. The table is gone, and I 
recline on the soft floor of this 
cabin or cell, this white cone-shaped 
place of imprisonment. The two 
robots still stand by me, why I do 
not know. 

“Atsog!” I cry aloud, suddenly 



remembering more. I had happened 
to be on the planet Atsog when the 
great fleet of the unliving, the ber- 
serker machines, attacked. The seven 
of us here were among the few sur- 
vivors, carried out of the deep shel- 
ters by the raiding machines. The 
memory is vague and jumbled, and 
invested with horror. 

“He’s awake!” says someone 
again. Again the women shrink from 
me. The old man raises his quiver- 
ing head to look, from where he 
and the doctor seem to be in con- 
ference. The stout young man jumps 
to his feet, facing me, fists clenched, 
as if I had threatened him. 

“How are you, Thad?” the doctor 
calls. After a moment’s glance my 
way, he answers himself: “He’s all 
right. One of you girls help him 
with some food. Or you, Halsted.” 

“Help him? God!” The black- 
haired girl flattens herself against 
the wall, as far from me as possible. 
The other two women crouch wash- 
ing someone’s garment in our prison 
sink. They only look at me and 
wash away. 

My head is not bandaged for noth- 
ing. I must be truly hideous, my face 
must be monstrously deformed, for 
three women to look so pitilessly at 
me. 

The doctor is impatient. “Some- 
one feed him, it must be done.” 

“He’ll get no help from me,” says 
the stout young man. “There are 
limits.” 

The black-haired girl begins to 
move across the chamber toward 
me, everyone watching her. 

“You would?” the young man 
marvels to her, and shakes his head. 



54 



IF 




S he moves slowly, as if walking is 
painful to her. Doubtless she 
too was injured in the battle; there 
are old healing bruises on her face. 
She kneels beside me, and guides my 
left hand to help me eat, and gives 
me water. My right side is not par- 
alyzed, but somehow unresponsive. 

When the doctor comes close 
again, I say: “My eye. Can I see?” 
Ke is quick to push my fingers 
away from the eyepatch. “For the 
present, you must use only your 
left eye. You’ve undergone brain 
surgery. If you take off that patch 
now, the consequences could be 
very serious, let me warn you.” 

I think he is being deceptive about 
the eyepatch. Why? 

The black-haired girl asks me: 
“Have you remembered anything 
more?” 

“Yes. Before Atsog fell, we heard 
that Johann Karlsen was leading out 
a fleet, to defend Sol.” 

All of them stare at me, hanging 
on my words. But they must know 
better than I what happened. 

“Did Karlsen win the battle?” I 
plead. Then I realize that we are 
prisoners still. 

I weep, 

“There’ve been no new prisoners 
brought in here,” says the doctor, 
watching me carefully. “I think 
Karlsen has beaten the berserkers. 
I think this machine is now fleeing 
from the human fleet. How does 
that make you feel?” 

“How?” Has my understanding 
failed with my verbal skills? 
“Good.” 

They all relax slightly. 

“Your skull was cracked when we 



bounced around in the battle,” the 
old man tells me. “You’re lucky a 
famous surgeon was here.” He nods 
his head. “The machine wants all 
of us kept alive, so it can study us. 
It gave the doctor what he needed 
to operate, and if he’d let you die, 
or remain paralyzed, things would 
have been bad for him. Yessir, it 
made that plain.” 

“Mirror?” I ask. I gesture at my 
face. “I must see. How bad.” 

“We don’t have a mirror,” says 
one of the women at the sink, as if 
blaming me for die lack. 

“Your face? It’s not disfigured,” 
says the doctor. His tone is con- 
vincing, or would be if I were not 
certain of my deformity. 

I regret that these good people 
must put up with my monster-pres- 
ence, compounding all their other 
troubles. “I’m sorry,” I say, and turn 
from them, trying to conceal my 
face. 

“You really don’t know,” says the 
black-haired girl, who has watched 
me silently for a long time. “He 
doesn’t know!” Her voice chokes. 
“Oh — Thad. Your face is all right.” 

T rue enough, the skin of my face 
feels smooth and normal when 
my fingers touch It. 'fhe black- 
haired girl watches me with pity. 
Rounding her shoulder, from inside 
her dress, are half-healed marks like 
the scars of a lash. 

“Someone’s hurt you,” I say, 
frightened. One of the women at 
the sink laughs nervously. The young 
man mutters something. I raise my 
left hand to hide my hideous face. 
My right comes up and crosses over 



WHAT T AND I DID 



15 




to finger the edges of the eyepatch. 

Suddenly the young man swears 
aloud, and points at where a door 
has opened in the wall. 

“The machine must want your ad- 
vice on something,” he tells me 
harshly. His manner is that of a man 
who wants to be angry but does not 
dare. Who am I, what am I, that 
these people hate me so? 

I get to my feet, strong enough 
to walk. I remember that I am the 
one who goes to speak alone with 
the machine. 

In a lonely passage it offers me 
two scanners and a speaker as its 
visible face. I know that the cubic 
miles of the great berserker machine 
surround me, carrying me through 
space, and I remember standing in 
this spot before the battle, talking 
with it, but I have no idea what was 
said. In fact I cannot recall the 
words of any conversation I have 
ever held. 

“The plan you suggested has 
failed, and Karlsen still functions,” 
says the cracked machine voice, hiss- 
ing and scraping in the tones of 
a stage villain. 

What could I have ever suggested, 
to this horrible thing? 

“I remember very little,” I say. 
“My brain has been hurt.” 

“If you are lying about your 
memory, understand that I am not 
deceived,” says the machine. “Pun- 
ishing you for your plan’s failure 
will not advance my purpose. I 
know that you live outside the laws 
of human organization, that you 
even refuse to use a full human 
name. Knowing you, I trust you to 
help me against the organization of 



intelligent life. You will remain in 
command of the other prisoners. 
See that your damaged tissues are 
repaired as fully as possible. Soon 
we will attack life in a new way.” 

There is a pause, but I have noth- 
ing to say. Then the noisy speaker 
scrapes into silence, and the scan- 
ner-eyes dim. Does it watch me 
still, in secret? But it said it trusted 
me, this nightmare enemy said it 
trusted in my evil to make me its 
ally. 

Now I have enough memory to 
know its speaks the truth about me. 
My despair is so great I feel sure 
that Karlsen did not win the battle. 
Everything is hopeless, because of 
the horror inside me. I have betray- 
ed all life. To what bottom of evil 
have I not descended? 

As I turn from the lifeless scan- 
ners, my eye catches a movement 
— my own reflection, in polished 
metal. I face the flat shiny bulkhead, 
staring at myself. 

My scalp is bandaged, and my 
left eye. That I knew already. There 
is some discoloration around my 
right eye, but nothing shockingly re- 
pulsive. What I can see of my hair 
is light brown, matching my two 
months’ unkempt beard. Nose and 
mouth and jaw are normal enough. 
There is no horror in my face. 

The horror lies inside me. I have 
willingly served a berserker. 

Like the skin around my right 
eye, that bordering my left eye’s 
patch is tinged with blue and green- 
ish-yellow, hemoglobin spilled under 
the skin and breaking down, some 
result of the surgeon’s work inside 
my head. 



56 



IF 




I remember his warning, but the 
eye-patch has the fascination for my 
fingers that a sore tooth has for 
the tongue, only far stronger. The 
horror is centered in my evil left 
eye, and I cannot keep from prob- 
ing after it. My right hand flies 
eagerly into action, pulling the patch 
away. 

I blink, and the world is blurred. 
I see with two eyes, and then I die. 

T staggered in the passage, growl- 
ing and groaning his rage, the 
black eyepatch gripped in his fin- 
gers. He had language now, he had 
a foul torrent of words, and he 
used them until his weak breath fail- 
ed. He stumbled, hurrying through 
the passage toward the prison cham- 
ber, wild to get at the wise punks 
who had tried such smooth trickery 
to get rid of him. Hypnotism, or 
whatever. Rename him, would they? 
He’d show them Thaddeus. 

T reached the door and threw it 
open, gasping in his weakness, and 
walked out into the prison chamber. 
The doctor’s shocked face showed 
that he realized T was back in con- 
trol. 

“Where’s my whip?” T glared 
around him. “What wise punk hid 
it?” 

The women screamed. Young 
Halsted realized that the Thaddeus 
scheme had failed; he gave a kind 
of hopeless yell and charged, swing- 
ing like a crazy man. Of course T’s 
robot bodyguards were too fast for 
any human. One of them blocked 
Halsted’s punch with a metal fist, 
so the stout man yelped and folded 
up, nursing his hand. 



“Get me my whip!” A robot went 
immediately to reach behind the sink, 
pull out the knotted plastic cord, and 
bring it to the master. 

T thumped the robot jovially, and 
smiled at the cringing lot of his fel- 
low prisoners. He ran the whip 
through his fingers, and the fingers 
of his left hand felt numb. He 
flexed them impatiently. “What’sa 
matter, there, Mr. Halsted? Some- 
thin’ wrong with your hand? Don’t 
wanna give me a handshake, wel- 
come me back? C’mon, let’s shake!” 
The way Halsted squirmed around 
on the floor was so funny T had to 
pause and give himself up to laugh- 
ing. 

“Listen you people,” he said when 
he got his breath. “My fine friends. 
The machine says I’m still in charge, 
see? That little information I gave 
it about Karlsen did the trick. Sol 
is lost. Boom! Haw haw haw! So 
you better try to keep me happy, 
’cause the machine’s still backing me 
a hunnerd per cent. You, Doc.” 
T’s left hand began trembling un- 
controllably, and he waved it. “You 
were gonna change me, huh? You 
did somethin’ nice to fix me up?” 
Doc held his surgeon’s hands be- 
hind him, as if he hoped to pro- 
tect them. “I couldn’t have made 
a new pattern for your character if 
I had tried — unless I went all the 
way, and turned you into a vegeta- 
ble. That I might have done.” 

“Now you wish you had. But you 
were scared of what the machine 
would do to you. Still, you tried 
somethin’, huh?” 

“Yes, to save your life.” Doc 
stood up straight. “Your injury pre-

WHAT T AND I DID 




cipitated a severe and almost con- 
tinuous epileptoid seizure, which the 
removal of the blood dot from your 
brain did not relieve. So, I divided 
the corpus callosum.” 

T flicked his whip. “What’s that 
mean?” 

44xrou see — the right hemis- 
jl phere, the dominant one in 
most people, controls the right side, 
and handles most judgment in- 
volving symbols.” 

“I know. When you get a stroke, 
the clot is on the opposite side 
from the paralysis.” 

“Correct.” Doc raised his chin. 
“T, I split your brain, right side 
from left. That’s as simply as I can 
put it. It’s an old but effective pro- 
cedure for treating severe epilepsy, 
and the best I could do for you 
here. I’ll take an oath on that, or a 
lie test — ” 

“Shuddup! I’ll give you a lie test!” 
T strode shakily forward. “What’s 
gonna happen to me?” 

“As a surgeon, I can say only 
that you may reasonably expect 
many years of practically normal 
life.” 

“Normal!” T took another step, 
raising his whip. “Why’d you patch 
my good eye, and start calling me 
Thaddeus?” 

“That was my idea,” interrupted 
the old man, in a quavery voice. “I 
thought — in a man like yourself, 
there had to be someone, some com- 
ponent, like Thad. With the psycho- 
logical pressure we’re under here, I 
thought Thad just might come out, 
if we gave him a chance in your 
right hemisphere. It was my idea. 



If it hurt you any, blame me.” 

“I will.” But T seemed, for the 
moment, more interested than en- 
raged. “Who is this Thaddeus?” 
“You are,” said the doctor. “We 
couldn’t put anyone else into your 
skull.” 

“Jude Thaddeus,” said the old 
man, “was a contemporary of Judas 
Iscariot. A similarity of names, but 
— ” He shrugged. 

T made a whistling, snorting 
sound, a single laugh. “You figured 
there was good in me, huh? It just 
had to come out sometime? Why, 
I’d say you were crazy, but you’re 
not. Thaddeus was real. He was 
there in my head for a while. May- 
be he’s still there, hiding. How do 
I get at him, huh?” T raised his 
right hand and jabbed a finger gent- 
ly at the corner of his right eye. 
“Ow. I don’t like to be hurt. I got 
a delicate nervous system. Doc, how 
come his eye is on the right side 
if everything crosses over? And if it’s 
his eye, how come I hafta feel what 
happens to it?” 

“I divided the optic chiasm, too. 
It’s a somewhat complicated — ” 
“Never mind. We’ll show Thad- 
deus who’s boss. He can watch with 
the rest of you. Hey, Blacky, 
c’mere. We haven’t played together 
for a while, have we?” 

“No,” the girl whispered. She 
hugged her arms around herself, 
nearly fainting. But she walked 
toward T. Two months as his slaves 
had taught all of them that obedience 
was easiest. 

“You like this punk Thad, huh?” 
T whispered, when she halted be- 
fore him. “You think his face is aH 



IF 




right, do you? How about my face? 
Look at me!” 

T saw his own left hand reach 
out, and touch the girl’s cheek, gent- 
ly and lovingly. He could see in her 
startled face that she felt Thaddeus 
in his hand; never had her eyes look- 
ed this way at T before. T cried out 
and raised his whip to strike her, 
and his left hand flew across his 
body to seize his own right wrist, 
like a terrier clamping jaws on a 
snake. 

Ts right hand still gripped the 
whip, but he thought the bones of 
his wrist were cracking. His legs 
tangled each other and he fell. He 
tried to shout for help, and could 
utter only a roaring noise. His ro- 
bots stood watching. It seemed a 
long time before the doctor’s face 
loomed over him, and the black 
patch descended gently upon his left 
eye. 

N ow I understand more deeply, 
and I accept. At first I wanted 
the doctor to remove my left eye, 
and the old man agreed, quoting 
some ancient Believers’ book to the 
effect that an offending eye should 
be plucked out. An eye would be a 
small price to rid myself of T. 

But after some thought, the doc- 
tor refused. “T is yourself,” he said 
at last. “I can’t point to him with 
my scalpel, and cut him out, al- 
though it seems I helped to separate 
the two of you. Now you control 
both sides of the body; once he 
did.” The doctor smiled wearily. 
“Imagine a committee of three, a 
troika inside your skull. Thaddeus 



is one, T another — and the third 
is the person, the force, that casts 
the deciding vote. You. That’s the 
best I can tell you.” 

And the old man nodded. 

Mostly, I do without the eye patch 
now. Reading and speaking are easi- 
er when I use my long-dominant 
left brain, and I am still Thaddeus 
— perhaps because I choose to be 
Thaddeus. Could it be that terribly 
simple? 

Periodically I talk with the ber- 
serker, which still trusts in T’s greedy 
outlawry. With their fleet ruined by 
Karlsen, the machines now search 
for new ways of attacking humani- 
ty. This one means to counterfeit 
much money, coins and notes, give 
the money to me, and deliver me in 
small launch to a highly civilized 
planet, relying on my greed to weak- 
en men there and set them against 
each other. 

But this machine is too damaged 
to watch its prisoners steadily, or it 
does not bother. With my freedom 
to move I have welded some of the 
silver coins into a ring, chilled this 
ring to superconductivity, and put 
it in a chamber near the berserker’s 
unliving heart. Halsted tells me we 
can use this ring, carrying a per- 
manent electric current, to trigger 
the launch’s C-plus drive premature- 
ly, and tear our berserker open from 
inside. We may damage it enough 
to save ourselves. Or we may all be 
killed. 

But while I live, I, Thaddeus, 
rule myself; and both my hands are 
gentle, touching long black hair.

ACROSS THE SEA OF DARKNESS

(V 









Across the sea of darkness, 

Across the sea of stars, 

Beyond the hills of earth so green, 
Beyond the sands of Mars. 

Are wonders never dreamt by man, 
Are fancies unfulfilled, 

Are other islands in the sky, 

Are truths yet undistilled. 

And all these things forbade to man, 
Until his childhood’s end, 

No longer a stranger in a strange 
land, 

But a creature with a gift to lend. 

For there’ll come the day when he 
throws away 

The binding chains of Earth, 

And while all the heavens stop and 
watch, 

He’ll enter his rebirth. 

He’ll flit between the planets, 

So easily will this be done, 

From Earth to Moon, Mars, Nep- 
tune, 

The children of the sun.

But there are more than three worlds 
to conquer, 

If man is to become the star king, 
These are but the toddling steps, 
To gain the most valuable thing. 

For soon he’ll leave his big front 
yard, 

And with it all his fears, 

And embark upon his longest voyage, 
Across the dark light-years. 

He’ll sail far beyond this horizon, 
Far beyond the reefs of space, 

And here on Earth shall gather the 
stars, 

Members of every conceivable race. 

All these things will be done. 

All these things will come to be, 
When a small, lost creature called 
man, 

Sets out to fulfill his destiny — 

Across the sea of darkness, 

Across the sea of stars, 

Beyond the hills of earth so green, 
Beyond the sands of Mars. 

He’ll soar beyond all estimation, 
And to the stars — his destination!

to make sure they were ready. “Com 
One?” That was his own communica- 
tions officer, who jerked his head 
in acknowledgement. Steve told him, 
“Tape this contact into message 
drones and send off one a minute. 
Gunnery One, see that cluster at ten 
by six by nine? Put a C-6 in front 
of it.” 

His gunnery officer punched but- 
tons, and a blue line began to grow 
from the center of the gunnery plot 
screen. Steve grinned as a recruit 



62 



stared at it nervously. He could re- 
member his own first action. 

The blue line disappeared and the 
visual screens all blanked out mo- 
mentarily as the missile, a simple 
light-maker, detonated. The cluster 
of radar blips had already opened 
out radially away from the missile’s 
path. They had the sense and the 
mobility, then, to avoid a single mis- 
sile. They swerved fast; three or 
four times the acceleration a human- 
oid could stand. He glanced at a 
mass indicator trained on them. The 
individual objects, whatever they 
were, had only about a fourth the 
mass of a man in a spacebag. The 
metal detector said they weren’t 
metallic. 

His evasion pattern began and he 
fought dizziness from the abrupt 
changes of direction. He snapped or- 
ders to individual ships. “Four; don’t 
let that bunch close in on you. Use 
local fire-control; light anti-person- 
nel stuff. Six and Eleven, I’m un- 
locking you. Move out fifty miles 
to one by five by two and lay proxi- 
mity mines. Come straight back in 
and we’ll give you a barrage. Four! 
Watch that bunch ahead of you! 
They might — ” He broke off and 
punched for a swift realignment and 
retreat of the whole squadron; but 
the blips were maneuvering like a 
swarm of computer-directed hornets, 
feinting, swerving suddenly into con- 
certed attacks from unguessable 
angles. “Local Fire Control I” he 
barked, “All units!” 

T hen it was a chaos too fast for 
human senses. The automatics 
found concentrations and sent mis- 



siles streaking; whipped space with 
giant laser beams. On his console a 
figure 4 blinked red. A frantic voice 
screamed tinnily in his earphones. 
“One One! We’re hit! Colonel O' ike, 
we’re — ” The humanoid, whom 
Steve recognized by his voice as a 
young Second-In-Command, got con- 
trol of himself. “One One, this is 
Four Two. Compartments One and 
Three knocked out by low-grade 
detonation. Radiation low — er, 
point zero one seven. Do you read 
me?” 

Steve shot a glance at his own 
Com officer, who nodded and re- 
plied to the striken ship. Steve block- 
ed two more ships into his own 
fire control and personally laid down 
a barrage around Six and Eleven, 
who were still isolated and under 
heavy attack. He got them back in 
without serious damage, though Six 
reported a detonation a few yards 
from her. Ship Nine died without 
even a chance to report. His ear- 
phones, turned down, were a babble 
of tiny voices reporting damage. The 
visual screens were useless, blanked 
out by a steady hell of explosions. 
Now, in this close-range melee, his 
missiles were impotent, or nearly so, 
but the laser beams, especially the 
light, quick-aiming ones, were do- 
ing good work; and the mine field 
he’d had the foresight to lay shield- 
ed him on one side. The radar 
screens were full of tiny blips shoot- 
ing away aimlessly, in free fall. 

Suddenly the remaining attack- 
ers streaked away, joining into a 
group — still two dozen* or more 
— then swerving to vanish into 
the blackness of space. Steve shot a 



GREE'S HELLCATS

look at a timer. Still four minutes 
to null. A sudden impulse seized 
him. 

He snapped, “Evasion ends!” and 
began unstrapping from his seat. 
“Two!” he called to his own Sec- 
ond, “Take over. Get me in a bag 
and outside. Send home a complete 
follow-up report. Null home with 
whatever ships can make it. Set up 
a random course for live ships who 
can’t, and arrange rescue. Come 
back for me with two ships in — 
oh, seventy-five minutes.” 

He propelled himself to the hatch 
that cut off the middle compartment; 
jabbed at the manual controls. It 
opened and he slid through. He had 
a plastic spacebag unstowed and half 
rigged before his Second reached 
him, sputtering, “But — but Colo- 
nel!” 

• “Move,” Steve told him with a 
grin. 

T hey sealed him into the bag and 
put him out, then nulled away. 
Far off, to one side of the comet, 
Number Four and one other ship 
limped away through normal space, 
lifetimes from their base if they 
weren’t rescued. Number Nine, to 
whose course and velocity he was 
matched, hung dark and lifeless a 
few hundred yards away. 

He approached her slowly, watch- 
ing his feeble radar screen for any 
of the hostile blips. When he was 
fifty .yards from her, an object de- 
tached itself from her hull and shot 
away in the direction the raiders had 
taken. He turned on all the drive he 
could stand, but it was like chas- 
ing a missile. He hit the control 



of his photoscanner, though the light 
from the local sun was weak. Visual- 
ly, he had a glimpse of something 
that lifted a small head painfully to 
stare back at him. The inside of 
the small spacebag it occupied seem- 
ed to be spattered with blood. 

He watched it disappear; then, 
furious at himself for not having 
sense enough to arrange some kind 
of a trap, he went back to examine 
number Nine. She’d been holed, all 
three compartments, probably by 
shaped charges. The corpses inside 
were not pretty. He took pictures 
then moved away to wait glumly for 
his rendezvous. He’d been in his 
share of space battles, and more; and 
had seen plenty of casualties. But this 
was the first time he, commanding, 
had ever lost ships and men. 

Six hours later, after a shower and 
a meal, he gave his first-hand report 
to his superiors. They were not hu- 
man, nor even humanoid — unless 
you could call a short-legged elf, 
with wings growing from the backs 
of his shoulders, humanoid. The 
Birds of Effogus had organized the 
resistence against Gree. 

T he highest-ranking one, whom 
Steve knew well, nodded as 
Steve finished, and pressed a con- 
trol on his low desk. The room lights 
dimmed. “You got better pictures 
than you think, Colonel,” he said 
in his spidery voice. "Here’s a com- 
posite of several frames.” A pro- 
jected picture appeared on one wall. 

There was more detail than Steve 
had been able to see. It was an ani- 
mal, all right, compact and muscu- 
lar. It was obviously badly hurt. One 



IF 





GREE'S HELLCATS

paw clutched at a metal fitting of 
the bag. It had three fingers and a 
passable thumb. Steve squinted, try- 
ing to make out something on the 
head. “Can those be natural horns?” 
They looked like two axeblades with 
serrated edges, rising at a forty-five 
degree angle from each side of the 
head, set longitudinally like stabili- 
zer fins on a submarine or aircraft. 
The animal’s mouth was partly open, 
showing teeth that Steve would have 
classified as omnivorous. 

“They’re horns,” the Bird croak- 
ed. “What about the spacebag, Colo- 
nel? Gree workmanship?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The Bird nodded again. “Colonel, 
we’re concerned about this. Not just 
as a tactical nuisance; we can de- 
vise weapons against that. But it 
may indicate a big advance in bi- 
ological science on Gree’s part. This 
animal’s braincase is very small for 
the sort of intelligence you describe.” 
Steve glanced involuntarily at the 
Bird’s own head, and earned a dry 
chuckle.. 

“Precisely the point, Colonel. 
When my ancestors redesigned their 
bodies, they were able to transfer 
considerable brain activity to other 
body tissues, thus permitting smaller 
heads. We’d be worried if Gree 
learned how to do that. Therefore, 
we’d like very much to know where 
these animals come from, and how 
they’re trained.” 

Steve said, a trifle sardonically, 
“I don’t suppose there’s much chance 
of finding out.” 

“It may not be impossible, Colonel. 
We know a little from this picture. 
Look at the set of that thumb — 



surely arboreal — but there are run- 
ning pads, too. And the animal 
must come from a planet with higher 
gravity than, for instance, your own 
ancestors were used to. And the fur 
is scant. Also, there are laws af- 
fecting evolution in certain parts of 
the galaxy, which may help. In ad- 
dition, we may pick up logistic 
hints.” 

“Well,” Steve said, “I have a 
grudge to settle. I’d like to volun- 
teer, in case you find the planet.” 
The Bird chuckled again. “Your 
orders are already written, Colonel. 
As a volunteer.” 

II 

S teve awoke after a few hours’ 
sleep to find a message telling 
him to report to the Bird general at 
the computer labs. He went eagerly, 
never before having been admitted 
to that scientific sanctum sanctorum 
of the Birds*. 

Things were a little peculiar in- 
side. The hallways were barely high 
enough to clear his scalp, even with 
a little stooping, but they were fif- 
teen-feet wide. The ‘doors’ that 
opened off the halls were horizontal 
panels just below ceiling level, fifteen 
feet wide but only two feet deep. 

The Bird who was guiding him 
flew near the ceiling, obviously hav- 
ing a little trouble flying slowly 
enough to match Steve’s walk. 
Around a turn, they met a Bird 
coming the opposite way who hover- 
ed in surprise at seeing a man here. 
Steve had the presence of mind to 
press himself against one wall. The 
oncoming Bird swooped and passed 



66 



IF 




under Steve’s guide, wingtips brush- 
ing Steve’s belt. 

The guide hovered before a panel, 
which opened for him. From inside, 
the general’s spidery voice called, 
“Is that you, Colonel Duke? I’m 
afraid you’re going to have to climb 
in.” 

In a* dimly lit room, the general 
sat (not perched) on a backless 
stool, with his wings drooping down 
behind it. Other Birds on similar 
stools worked at a row of keyboards 
along one wall. In the wall above 
each keyboard was a projection 
screen three feet square, with two 
more screens above it, of the same 
width but only six inches high. A 
festival of colors and symbols danced 
on several of the screens, sometimes 
seemingly in concert. 

The general swivelled around on 
his stool to face the blank wall away 
from the computers, and motioned 
with a wingtip to another stool be- 
side him. 

“Sit down, Colonel. I want to 
show you something that happen- 
ed less than an hour ago.” 

The lights dimmed farther, and a 
view of a starfield flashed into being 
on the blank wall. The scene swung 
and a deep-space asteroid came in- 
to sight, spotily illuminated by light 
beams from a dozen space-bags. In 
the bags were humanoids. A small 
exploration ship, which Steve recog- 
nized as friendly, drifted nearby. 
Ship and bags were tiny toys against 
the huge bulk of the asteroid. The 
scene expanded a little as (Steve 
supposed) the camera drone that 
was taking the picture moved steadi- 
ly in. 



T he bags were settling to the as- 
teroid, ready to begin prospect- 
ing. Suddenly, the area was dotted 
with smaller bags, darting about like 
gnats. Steve grunted and gripped 
the seat of his stool, knowing what 
was to come. The ship moved sud- 
denly, but too late. She died in a 
quick flurry of detonations that were 
moderate but deadly enough. The 
humanoids, who’d been streaking 
toward her, now scattered in panic. 
The small bags — the animals in 
them tiny blurs of motion — darted 
among them. One by one the larger 
bags collapsed. Steve was glad the 
picture wasn’t close enough to show 
details of the humanoids’ dying. At 
the last, a pitiful four or five gath- 
ered together for a hopeless mutual 
defense. Another moderate explo- 
sion finished them off. 

The projection vanished and the 
general turned to face Steve. “I’m 
afraid I underestimated the nuisance 
value, Colonel. We just happened to 
have the camera drone there be- 
cause that was an interesting chunk 
of rock. Gree nulled those animals 
to the spot, a mere fifteen of them. 
I expect reports to start pouring in, 
of unexplained losses.” 

Steve controlled the emotion the 
scene had raised. “Any progress in 
finding the planet, sir?” 

“I think so. Unless we’re wrong, 
we’ve narrowed it down to a single 
star cluster.” The general turned 
back toward the computer wall. “If 
you don’t mind staying, we may have 
something within the next half hour 
or so.” 

The weird dance of colors and 
symbols went on. A Bird near one 



GREFS HELLCATS 



67 




end of the line sang something in 
Ihe high-pitched Effogan language. 
All the big screens went blank, while 
turrent results held on the narrow 
•creens. The general told Steve, “The 
probability is confirmed. Camera 
drones are already nulling to the 
cluster, but meanwhile we’ll look at 
Rt irs already catalogued.” 

T he dance of colors, without 
symbols this time, resumed, 
and now Steve realized he was look- 
ing at star spectra. The general said, 
“There’s a peculiarity of the Titan- 
ium bands in this cluster that could 
influence the evolution. It’s mostly 
theory, of course, but with high com- 
puter probability.” 

Presently the spectra stopped 
shifting, and two screens at one end 
rippled with symbols, working out 
some complex mathematical prob- 
lem. The two operators finished and 
sang soft reports, which the general 
apparently didn’t need, for he was 
already telling Steve, “It’s narrowed 
down to a few dozen planets. Drones 
are already moving in. This will take 
a few minutes; we have to be care- 
ful.” 

In twenty minutes — time for 
the camera drones to null to the 
cluster, find the individual planets, 
seek out land areas, and snap pic- 
tures, then null home — one of the 
operators • pulled something from a 
slot, spread his wings (startling Steve 
in the confinement of the room), 
and swooped to the general. The 
room lights came on. The general 
peered for a minute at a four-inch- 
square card, then handed it to Steve. 
“You can see the animals.” 



The photo was obviously much 
enlarged; blurry and confusing. 
Steve gradually made out clumps of 
trees on fairly level ground. There 
were some small objects which one 
might as well take for a troop of 
animals as anything else. Yes, he 
could see it now — the white mark- 
ings on the heads would be the 
horns. 

“The planet’s livable,” the general 
told him, “though the gravity may 
bother you at first. Wp thought rath- 
er than delay by acclimating you 
artificially, we’d set you down and 
let you get used to it first hand.” 
One of the tricks for sneaking on- 
to an enemy planet was to wait until 
a meteor shower made ionization 
trails in the atmosphere and con- 
fused enemy radar, if any. There 
was no shower due, so the Birds 
made one. Steve landed in a space- 
bag the power of which barely last- 
ed, wearing a Greeslave Gunner’s 
uniform, in foothills some miles from 
the spot of the photo. He buried 
the useless bag, buckled equipment 
about himself, and started hiking. 
Somewhere on this continent there 
were supposed to be hidden labs, 
and a garrison of Gree humanoid 
slaves who hunted and processed the 
animals. 

Ill 

T he gravity did tire him at first, 
though it wasn’t really high. He 
watched local fauna to learn what 
not to eat, and for signs of danger. 
There were birds in the sky to warn 
of aircraft. There was a variety of 
small game, and plenty of nuts and 



68 



IF 




berries, though this tended to be a 
dry planet. The brushland he was 
in didn’t provide much concealment, 
but he camouflaged his helmet with 
twigs; and horizontal visibility 
wasn’t great because of heat shim- 
mer. That worked two ways, of 
course. 

The only really dangerous-looking 
predator was a thing like a large, 
hairless canine, probably twice his 
own weight, that hunted singly and 
silently. It had short, thick legs. 
There was usually one following 
him, but evidently only out of cur- 
iosity, since none ever gave him the 
taste test. 

He took his time, letting his 
muscles adjust. After ten days he 
was comfortable if he didn’t exert 
himself too much. The sun felt good; 
and the heavy, sagey air was invig- 
orating once he got used to it, ex- 
cept when there was carrion close 
by. 

He’d been traveling gradually 
downhill, but on the fourteenth day 
he reached an abrupt levelling off 
where the ground was less dry and 
there were clumps of trees. He 
scouted one of those and found a 
lookout tree at the edge. Grunting 
with effort, he climbed it. This 
looked very much like the terrain of 
the photograph. 

Early the next morning he saw a 
band of the homed animals. He 
settled himself in a crotch and un- 
cased his binoculars. 

The animals’ fur was even thin- 
ner than he’d expected, and the 
beast’s sinews stood out like steel 
cables. This was a group of about 
three dozen, both sexes and all 
GREFS HELLCATS 



ages, with a loose social organiza- 
tion based on strength and sagacity. 
They ate fruit, nuts, berries, insects, 
small vertebrates, and birds’ eggs 
when they could get them. More 
than anything, they reminded him of 
large rodents, except for the horns 
and the strongly prehensile tails. 
Their legs were short, but had ball- 
and-socket joints at the. elbows as 
well as at the shoulders. They ran 
usually on all fours but could stand 
erect. They were extremely fast, and, 
in the trees, real acrobats. 

The horns were about three inches 
from front to back, roughly the 
same height from base to pronged 
edges, and an inch thick at the base. 
The ear-holes were below the 
horns, as if they used sound reflec- 
tion from them. 

They were certainly quick, bright 
animals, and it was clear that they’d 
adapt readily to space; but they were, 
after all, just animals. Nothing about 
them indicated any intelligence cap- 
able of using instruments or even 
tools. So, as the Birds suspected, 
Gree must be upgrading them. 

I t was another seventeen days be- 
fore he was lucky enough to 
find a hunt. 

A fleet of aircars appeared, land- 
ed, and discharged squads of human- 
oids who joined into a line. They 
moved slowly, in a direction that 
would take them past Steve if he 
stayed put. Then more aircars went 
over, and he could guess where 
they’d put down to add another 
segment of a wide circle. He could 
still get outside that circle, if he 
wanted to. 



69 




A troop of the horned animals 
flashed by, and he knew the country 
well enough to guess where they 
were going. There was a hollow not 
far away where the trees were thick- 
er. That, of course, was where the 
hunt would converge, penning in all 
the animals in the area. He decided 
suddenly he wanted to be there. 

He slid down from his tree and 
made a quick cache of the instru- 
ments he didn’t dare carry, then 
ran, keeping under cover, to get in- 
side the circle. A large band of ani- 
mals wheeled to face him, old males 
to the front, but he skirted them 
and they didn’t attack. There were 
other bands in sight, all retreating to 
the hollow. One of the big preda- 
tors trotted by, its ears pressed low 
to its head, ignoring Steve and the 
horned animals. 

He reached the edge of the thicket, 
penetrated a way, and found himself 
a dense patch of brush to hide in. 
More of the quarry streaked by, 
many of them taking to the trees 
and leaping from limb to limb. In 
fifteen minutes he heard voices. 
There seemed to be a halt for final 
organization, then the hunt came on 
into the thicket. 

Soft popping sounds began, punc- 
tuated with angry roars and shrieks 
of the animals, and occasionally with 
the splat of a laser rifle. The hunters 
thrashed by in the brush on both 
sides of him, and emerged into the 
small glade at the edge of which he’d 
chosen to hide. 

T here were men and B’lant and 
half a dozen other slave human- 
oid races, with a few Overseers di- 



recting them. Every other man in the 
line carried an air gun shooting 
anesthetic darts. They chose young 
animals, not too high in the trees 
and not too close to themselves. The 
poison acted within seconds, and the 
brush was full of brief thrashings. 
The odd men in line carried laser 
rifles and used them when the an- 
imals attacked. The thicket was a 
bedlam now, of screaming animals 
and shouting men and the sound of 
the guns, and the thrashing about 
in the brush. 

A group of old males suddenly 
charged from hiding. There was a 
short chaos of laser beams, hurtling 
forms, yells and screams and roars. 
Other hunters closed in from both 
sides to help, and the attack was 
beaten off, but six or seven hunters 
lay motionless or twisted in pain. 
Overseers shouted to get the line re- 
formed, spoke into their throat- 
mikes (no doubt calling for med 
techs), then moved the hunt on. It 
vanished toward the center of the 
hollow. 

This was Steve’s chance to get in- 
to the secret base! 

He shoved his laser pistol and 
some other things deep in the brush, 
then crawled into the open, acting 
dazed in case any of the wounded 
were watching. He picked up a 
dart-gun and wandered after the 
hunt. 

A wounded animal hurtled at him 
suddenly and he barely got the gun- 
butt up in time to ward it off. There 
was a crunch of bone and it lay 
still. That gave him a better idea 
than catching up with the hunt. 
When the hunt was over, the squads 



70 



IF 




would be rounded up and counted 
by their Overseers — but the wounded 
would probably go back separately, 
as they were picked up, without an 
immediate check. And there was al- 
ways confusion in the med stations 
when a lot of casualties came in; 
and confusion was just what he 
wanted. 

He took his knife and made a 
small cut in the left sleeve of his 
uniform, below the elbow, so it 
would rip. Then he deliberately gash- 
ed his forearm on the horns of the 
dead animal. Blood welled out and 
he tore the sleeve off the uniform to 
make a crude compress. Then he 
went back to the glade, muttered a 
few words to the conscious wound- 
ed there, and sat down with his 
back against a tree. 

Before long an aircar settled to 
the glade, and two med techs ran 
around giving treatment where it was 
needed immediately. They loaded 
four of the worst cases and took 
off, telling Steve and the others that 
there’d be another car. There was, 
within minutes, and Steve climbed 
aboard. 

His gash burned like the devil as 
they swabbed it with antiseptic, and 
he pretended to half faint so no one 
would ask him any questions. 

IV 

T he base was underground. They 
entered by an opening whose 
camouflage Steve sincerely admired. 

They dumped him at a med sta- 
tion where casualties and techs were 
milling around in enough confusion 
so he could slip from one line to 



another. He got by a preliminary 
questioning by giving a name and 
number at random and acting dazed. 
He got rid of his torn uniform, got 
some skin-patch sprayed on his cut, 
then went through a med booth 
that sniffed, prodded, and sprayed 
before spitting him out, theoretically 
disinfected and viable. He got out 
of that line quickly and went look- 
ing for a uniform he, could wear. 

There were many uniforms be- 
ing discarded by casualties about to 
get treatment. He got his hands on 
a fairly fresh-looking uniform, an 
Apprentice Astrogator’s, before it 
went into a laundry chute. Carry- 
ing it over an arm, he headed 
toward the latrine. A med tech stop- 
ped him and began to ask questions, 
but Steve grinned and pointed to 
the latrine and acted urgent, and 
the tech let him go. He donned the 
uniform inside, waited a few min- 
utes, then left. 

He edged into a group who’d al- 
ready been processed and were be- 
ing released, and got out of the med 
station with them. Outside, he 
found a chance to slip away. Now 
he had to stay inconspicuous until 
he knew his way around. He found 
a recreation area where some B’lant 
were playing a very accurate game 
of quoits. He stayed there, seeing 
all he could, until mealtime, then 
joined a line, and ate with the gen- 
eral pool. 

It was apparent by now that the 
general pool here was made up of 
washouts or battle veterans in some 
way unfit for first-line duty. Some 
of them acted as if they’d had brain 
damage or brain surgery to remove 



GREE'S HELLCATS 



71 




dangerous memories. In other words, 
a collection of low-grade expend- 
ables to use in the hunts. That suited 
Steve. A few peculiarities on his own 
part would go unnoticed. 

There was the usual Overseer’s 
section of the mess, and another 
where slaves other than the general 
pool ate. In this latter section he 
saw many computer techs and a lot 
of meds. Possibly the meds, most 
of them, were actually working as 
veterinarians. 

Steve couldn’t hope to stay free 
long, just wandering around; some 
Overseer was sure to round him up 
and put him through an Inquisitor 
booth. He knew he didn’t have the 
personality conditioning to fool the 
booths, as he had once. He must find 
a hiding spot; or, better but less 
likely, a way in and out of the base. 

Then he remembered they were 
underground. That meant a consider- 
able ventilating system. 

I t took some precarious searching, 
but he located a storeroom with 
a ventilator grill big enough to crawl 
into and hidden enough to work at. 
It was a food storeroom, so the 
natural thing was to attach himself 
to a work party from the kitchens 
and hide out when they left the 
storeroom. He had a table knife he’d 
stolen, and a pair of pliers he’d got- 
ten the same way. 

He not only had to get the grill 
loose, but put it back after he was 
in the duct. He finally accomplished 
that, then crawled along the duct, 
having a hard time where it turned 
vertical to ceiling level. Once there, 
he crawled along until he found an 



access hatch. He worked at its nuts 
and bolts until he could get out. 

He was in a dark place, with the 
feel of plenty of room around him. 
He listened and heard nothing but 
the hum of blowers and the whoosh 
of the drafts. As his eyes adjusted 
he saw a spot of luminosity over his 
head, and another not far away. Fi- 
nally he realized this was not an 
attic, but a natural cave, with the 
roof high overhead. The spots of 
luminescence were airshafts to the 
surface, doubtless with two or more 
bends in them so debris wouldn’t fall 
in. The buildings lay along the bot- 
tom of the cave like a string of 
boxes. The air ducts ran along the 
top of the buildings. 

But down the middle of the line 
of buildings was a vertical partition 
that seemed to go up to the cave 
roof. He explored along that until 
he found a door, latched but not 
locked. He opened it carefully, and 
there was a slight hiss as an air- 
tight seal parted. He understood the 
layout, then. The cave was split into 
halves, longitudinally. The side with 
the ducts was pressure intake; on 
the other side, stale air found its 
own way out of each room, and out 
of the cave by a separate line of 
shafts. 

He thought that might make his 
spying easier. However, he found 
there were not simply grills in the 
ceiling of each room; there were 
light traps that had to be removed 
before he could see in. He managed 
with the table knife and pliers, but 
he decided on his next trip inside 
he’d acquire some better tools. 

Before he began spying, he look- 



72 



IF 




ed around for emergency hiding 
places. On the other side, the branch- 
ing and turning ducts offered nooks 
and nests. On this side there were 
none. But the buildings did not touch 
the cave wall, and between there 
was a dark gap, varying in width, at 
the bottom of which he could hear 
a faint trickle of water. It wasn’t 
far down; and by experimenting he 
found that, at a place where the rock 
wall approached close, he could 
work his way down, pressing his 
back against the building. 

T he captured animals were easy 
to locate by the smell that came 
out of the ventilators. There were a 
number of pens, each holding a 
few animals and equipped with feed- 
ing and watering apparatus. 

Farther along were chutes into 
which the animals were driven, one 
by one. Each animal got a jab with 
a needle that produced quick an- 
esthesia. The inert animals were 
strapped belly down on tables; where 
techs using small power tools with 
hole-saw blades cut circular open- 
ings, an inch and a half in diameter, 
on the inward side of each of the 
animals’ horns. The horns were hol- 
low, with moderately thin walls, leav- 
ing space inside. Into this space 
other techs inserted bits of miniatu- 
rized appartus, positioning them 
carefully, nearly filling each horn, 
and finally forcing in some kind of 
cement or mastic to make a solid fit. 
After that the cut-out discs were re- 
placed. They even had thin annular 
rings of horn or bone to make a 
tight fit. No doubt the horn would 
grow together. 



Steve could see no mechanical 
connections to the brain, and he 
imagined there’d be fairly thick skull 
under the horns. There must be elec- 
tronic fields from the gadgets, then; 
like the much greater fields that 
probed one’s bodily responses in an 
Inquisitor booth. Were the things 
just pain producers, to control the 
animals? He didn’t think so. His en- 
counter with the band in spacebags 
hadn’t indicated remote control. And 
of course there was no concept in 
the animal’s brains of the difference 
between a lie and the truth. 

Some kind of brain supplements, 
then; perhaps like computer memory 
banks, somehow communicating 
with the dim minds. 

He went further down the line, 
and was not surprised to find galler- 
ies jammed with artificial training 
aids. He could guess at what went 
on: simulated space targets; recog- 
nition training, including some iden- 
tification of friends via secret radio 
signals; specific sets of circumstances 
to be recognized and corresponding 
ways to react; reward-and-punish- 
ment. No wonder the beasts were 
effective, with this and with their 
quick reflexes. 

He wondered what, if anything, 
would happen if he got a set of the 
gadgets, wrapped up or taped the 
components in their proper rela- 
tionship (he could see it was simple) 
and held them against his own head. 

Of course his duty was to steal a 
set of the things and escape with 
them. But he couldn’t escape with 
them until he got them; and once 
he had them, it shouldn’t be too 
much of a risk to try them out.

V 

H e slipped back into tbe build- 
ings, had another meal, and 
spyed around some more. Then, re- 
entering the ducts, he went fron 
storeroom to storeroom, acquiring 
a razor, a new Gunner’s uniform, 
two laser pistols, some tools, and a 
few other items he might want. He 
had a shower and shave before he 
went looking for the gadgets. 

He found where they were stored, 
waited until the place was deserted, 
and stole a set, still boxed, from 
the rear of a shelf lot. He went back 
up to the exhaust side of the cave, 
squeezed his way down into the gap 
between cave wall and buildings, 
and walked along the smoothed cave 
floor until he had more room and 
didn’t have to stand in mud. He 
risked a small light and got the in- 
struments, a set for each side of his 
head, fastened in their proper re- 
lationships with gummed-rubber 
tape. They had their own power 
supplies. Gingerly at first, he held 
them against his head, at the right 
angle, just above his ears. There was 
nothing. He moved them closer, fi- 
nally pressing them against his skull, 
disappointed. 

Then, just as he was about to give 
up, there was an odd kneading sen- 
sation in his head, not painful, fol- 
lowed by- a lightning confusion of 
scenes, phrases, and concepts from 
his own memory. Some of them he 
hadn’t thought of for years. They 
followed no pattern that he could 
discern. They stopped, and suddenly 
a soundless voice shouted in his 
head, I! I AM I! SKELETON, 



MUSCLES, VISCERA, BRAIN; 
LUNGS BREATHING, HEART 
PUMPING! HERE! NOW! IN 
THIS CAVE! I’LL SUCCEED! 
I’LL GET THESE AWAY, AND 
IT WILL THWART GREE, AND 

There was an awful blast of 
sound, pressure, agony, terror. He 
jerked the things from his head and 
leaned, gasping, against the rough 
rock. Gradually, his wits returned. 
What had happened? 

It must have been his triumphant 
thought against Gree. Of course! The 
animals, by some concept — some 
vague image of kind master and 

protector — would be taught obedi- 
ence and loyalty to Gree, just as 
humanoid slaves were. 

T here were obviously feedbacks 
in the instruments, and artifici- 
al guilt feelings, and monitor cir- 
cuits. Carefully, he brought the 

things near his head again. He 

found he could only avoid the 
thought — feelings, rather — that 
brought on the punishment, by 

thinking hard of other things. 

He concentrated on an abstract 
thought, as well as he could: A 
planet without inclination or eccen- 
tricity has no seasons, unless its sun 
is a variable or there is some other 
outside influence. There were only 
vague echoes of the concepts planet 
and sun. He tried thinking of the 
word-sounds : T wenty-one times 

fifty-seven is . Instantly, the 
words eleven hundred ninety-seven 
popped into his mind. 

The thing was a computer, then, 
as well as a monitor. That didn’t 



74 



IF 




surprise him. What surprised him 
was that it was programmed to 
compute from English words repre- 
senting numbers. He remembered 
the kneading sensation, and the flash 
of ideas, when he’d first put the 
things to his head. Maybe there was 
some sort of self-adjustment by the 
gadgets; some zeroing-in to fit the 
individual mind. Maybe they were 
designed for use on other animals 
than their particular species, in ad- 
dition. 

As he stood there wondering, 
there was a whisper of thought: At- 
tention! Sounds! A door in the par- 
tition opening; that one a hundred 
and sixty paces away from the spot 
on the partition opposite you. Two 
sets of footsteps. One foot of one 
man drags a little. There’s an oddity 
in the echoes; there must be a vault 
in the cave right there that distorts 
it. They’re moving the other way. 
Note the angle of their course; about 
twenty -five degrees , converging, on 
the way you’re facing . Astound- 
ed, Steve listened. It was all coming 
from his own mind, of course. But 
things seemed to be amplified. His 
ears were as keen as a cat’s; he 
also seemed to be sniffing the air. 
And the spatial sense was incredible. 
Just by listening — and computing 
the time lag for the sound to reach 
him — he could have aimed a pistol, 
if the building were not in the way, 
giving exactly the proper lead. 

He decided he’d better get out of 
his present position while they were 
headed the . other way. They might 
shine a flashlight down into the 
gap. Before he took the gadgets from 
his head, they whispered, There was 



GREE'S HELLCATS 




that foothold, seventeen inches up 
from the floor; and the other one for 
the right foot, five inches above and 
two inches to the side. Don’t forget 
that sharp point that dug into your 
finger . Suddenly shivering, he 
jerked the things away from his 
skull and stuffed them in his pockets. 
He’d climb out under his own power. 

T he quicker he got out of the 
base and off-planet, the better. 
He could possibly sneak into a hunt- 
ing party and desert it in the brush, 
but he might wind up a long way 
from his caches, with no way to sig- 
nal the Birds. It would be better to 
use Gree transportation. But how? 

He got through the partition and 
hurried to where his loot was hid- 
den. He wiped the mud off his shoes 
and changed into the fresh uniform, 
which would give him some privi- 
leges and an excuse to wear a pistol. 
But where would he hide the brain- 
gadgets? They’d bulge too much in 
the pockets of the one-piece uniform. 

A pressure suit! Those were clear 
plastic, but had plenty of slack, and 
enough apparatus at various places 
to hide the gadgets. And, if he were 
going via spaceship (which, he 
thought wryly, he seemed to have 
decided, however overoptimistically) 
a suit would be natural. 

He hid what he wasn’t taking, 
found the right duct and got into 
it, and crawled to the storeroom 
where the suits were issued. By now 
he had rope and a clamp to make 
the vertical part of the trip easy. At 
floor level, he peered out into the 
storeroom. There were voices and 
the scrape of shoes, but no one in 



sight. He got the grill loose, crawled 
out, and replaced the grill. The 
voices, and the sound of work, came 
from behind a barrier of ceiling- 
high shelves. He went to the end 
of that row and peered around. Two 
humanoids were stowing suit fittings 
into the shelf bins. When they both 
faced away, he slipped past and went 
down the crossaisle to the front of 
the compartment. Down at the mid- 
dle aisle, a man with Storekeeper’s 
shoulder insignia sat at a desk, work- 
ing at an adding machine. 

Steve drew back and went between 
the shelves almost to the middle aisle, 
a few feet behind the man. He put 
his head in a bin to muffle his voice, 
and tried to imitate the accent of 
the particular kind of humanoids 
who were working farther back. 
“Storekeeper!” 

A voice said, “What is it?” 

Steve called again, more urgently, 
“Storekeeper!” A chair squeaked 
and the man stepped into sight. His 
eyes darted toward Steve, but Steve’s 
fist was already crashing at the man’s 
temple. He went limp and Steve 
caught him and lowered him silently. 
He dragged him a few feet from the 
aisle, then stepped swiftly to the 
desk. He sat down and pulled open 
drawers until he found the kind of 
requisition form he wanted, and also 
the storekeeper’s electronic signature 
stamp. He scribbled, stamped, and 
went back to where the two human- 
oids were at work. “Where’s the 
storekeeper?” 

They looked at him dully, then 
one finally said, “He, uh, was at 
desk.” 

Steve shrueaed. “He’s not there 



76 



IF 




now.” He thrust out th* requisition. 
“Where do I find a doubte-S Nine? 
I’m in a rush.” 

The one who’d spoken hesitated, 
glanced at Steve’s Gunner, Class 
Three, insignia, then turned to lead 
the way. 

Steve got the right suit and kept 
his eyes on the humanoid to make 
sure he went back to work and not 
toward the desk. Then he left and 
hurried along the corridor to the 
nearest latrine, where he put on the 
suit and stowed the brain-gadgets. 

VI 

S ince no ships landed or left via 
atmosphere, the base must have 
a null tank. The largest kind, big 
enough to receive a Scout, consisted 
of four concentric steel tanks, very 
large and very stout walled, with 
air pumps between. They were 
pumped out, with graduated degrees 
of thoroughness, until the inner one 
had a hard vacuum. Not that a 
vacuum was necessary to null out 
— a ship could null out of atmo- 
sphere, or even an ocean, and only 
leave an implosion behind — but 
incoming ships needed the vacuum, 
because to materialize into space 
where there were more than a very 
few atoms of matter would require 
impossible amounts of power. 
There’d almost certainly be a Scout 
in the tank, ready to go, as that 
was standard practice unless a ship 
was due in and the tank was being 
pumped out. 

He made inquiries and confirmed 
that, as he’d expected, the tank was 
deeper in the cave. He walked, rath- 



er than visit the ground car trans- 
portation pool. 

Eventually he reached a fence, 
with an Inquisitor Booth, beyond 
which was a lighted, swelling part 
of the cave, with the huge cylinders 
looming in it. There were two armed 
B’lant on guard. He walked up to 
them and said, “I’m supposed to 
report to somebody named Kwale.” 
“Where are your . orders?” one 
B’lant asked. 

“I suppose he has them. I just 
got a verbal order, a few minutes 
ago.” 

The B’lant stared at him for a 
second. “What was zat name?” 
“Kwale.” 

The B’lant muttered into his 
throat-mike, then waited, listening to 
his earplug. Presently he frowned 
at Steve. “Zere is no record.” 

Steve made a helpless gesture. “I 
don’t know about it. I just got a 
call, for guard duty. I was supposed 
to get this suit from stock, and when 
I got there they had a requisition al- 
ready, from this Kwale.” 

“Wait,” the B’lant said, and mut- 
tered again. He listened, then nod- 
ded. He said, “Zere was a requisi- 
tion filed, for a rush order, by a 
Storekeeper named Kwale. But why 
should a Storekeeper give you or- 
ders?” 

“How should I know?” Steve ask- 
ed. “It was something about a spe- 
cial shipment we were going to pick 
up. I supposed some Overseer had 
ordered me along, as a guard.” 

The B’lant grunted. “Maybe zo. 
Where is zis Kwale?” 

“Why, I thought he’d be inside.” 
The B’lant pondered briefly. “We 



GREE'S HELLCATS 



77 




change ze guard not long ago. May- 
be you are right. Anyway, zrough 
ze booth.” He reached for a but- 
ton and the outer door of the booth 
swung open. 

T his was what Steve had been 
working for. He started into 
the booth, but stopped the door from 
closing with his foot. He perked 
out his pistol, thrust it around the 
edge of the booth, and slashed back 
and forth with the beam. There 
were two hoarse screams, and a 
beam sizzled on the booth inches 
from his hand. He heard the bodies 
fall. His laser pistol fused the lock 
on the inner door and he burst 
through, already running toward the 
small door in the looming cylinder. 
No one saw him coming, apparent- 
ly. He went through the door. A 
humanoid, a mere clerk but armed, 
looked up from a desk. Steve walk- 
ed toward him, fumbling beneath 
his suit as if for his orders, then 
suddenly struck hard at the throat 
with the points of his doubled 
knuckles. The humanoid gasped and 
staggered, and Steve hurled him side- 
ways and struck lethally at the back 
of the neck. He swiftly scanned the 
controls on the desk, punched at 
some of them, and ran toward the 
lock which opened into the outer 
tank. 

By the time that one ground open, 
the inner 1 ones had too. He went 
through them without breaking 
stride, already seeing the hull of a 
Scout in the inner tank. He turned 
and slapped at the manual controls 
of the inner hatch, stared out im- 
patiently until it cut off his vision. 



He thought he heard a shout just 
as it closed. He set the controls so 
they couldn’t be overridden from 
outside unless they got at the wiring 
and made a short-circuit. 

He opened the hatch of the Scout 
and slid in, his eyes going immedi- 
ately to the console. Plenty of fuel, 
but no charge in the null-accumula- 
tors. It would take ten minutes to 
build that up. He shut the hatch 
and punched buttons, got the field 
building up, then turned on outside 
viewers so he could watch the tank’s 
hatch. 

Now there was nothing he could 
do but wait. There were two things 
his enemies could do. They could 
tear into the wiring — he thought 
that would take a half hour or so 
— or they could bring in a heavy 
laser and cut into the tank. But 
that might take more than ten min- 
utes, too. 

About when he expected it, the 
familiar paternal voice came over 
the radio. “You, in the tank. What 
are you doing there?” He grinned 
and did not answer. The more time 
they wasted talking, the better. The 
voice said, “What is your name? 
It is Gree who asks.” A little later, 
more sternly, “Come out! Gree com- 
mands! You will not be punished. 
You are sick; you will be made 
well.” 

S teve let it talk on, while he punch- 
ed out a program for a null- 
hop to a rendezous. There was a 
hiss from somewhere, pinching out 
as a gasket sealed. Steve went taut. 
What were they doing? 

A gauge gave him the answer: 



78 



IF 




pressure outside the ship was down 
by a couple of pounds. They were 
pumping out the inner tank. Why? 

Suddenly, he knew. A bomb! 
They were pumping down so they 
could null a bumb into the tank 
with him! Somewhere, maybe only 
a few thousand miles out in space, 
a Gree ship-of-the-line hung, null- 
projector locked on the co-ordinates 
of this tank. It would not have to 
be a big bomb, and they might 
not need a very hard vacuum. He 
glanced at a timer. Still six minutes 
to null. He looked at the gauge that 
showed outside pressure. He began 
to sweat. They’d be ahead of him by 
three minutes or so. 

He still had one resource. There 
was air in the Scout; not only the 
air in the compartments, but re- 
serve air, compressed in tanks. The 
huge pumps handled a lot of air 
fast, but it was the final traces that 
took time. When they got down to a 
fair vacuum, he’d bleed out the 
Scout’s air and let them struggle 
with that. 

The outside pressure crawled down 
to a fraction of a pound. He crack- 
ed the hatches of the other com- 
partments so air leaked out slowly. 
No use making it obvious. He could 
feel the vibration of the escaping 
air. When the compartments other 
than his own were empty, he start- 
ed releasing compressed air. The 
gauge needle wavered. Surely they’d 
guess now. He set his suit to hold 
ten pounds; and let his own com- 
partment bleed down to that. He 
thought he could stay conscious at 
ten pounds, even though he was 
acclimated to the planet’s eighteen. 



The vibration of escaping air enct- 
ed, and now there was only the 
throb of the great pumps, faintly 
felt through the steel of the tanks 
and of the ship. He stared at the 
timer. Incredible, there were still 
four minutes to null. Gradually he 
understood that he was beaten. A 
sickness grew in his middle; not so 
much fear as an awful remorse. He’d 
been cocky. He’d taken a risky, has- 
ty way. If he’d been content with 
sneaking out . 

H e felt light-headed now, from 
the change in pressure. The 
outside gauge showed less than a 
quarter of a pound. It seemed he 
could feel the pumps more distinctly 
now, like martial drums beating out 
the instants to his execution. He 
found himself hunching his shoulders 
against the bomb, and straightened 
angrily. He would not die just stand- 
ing here! He could leave the ship 
and get the inner tank’s lock open; 
get to the second tank, at least. 
Probably they’d be waiting there. 
Or they might just let him stay, 
sealed up, and go ahead with their 
bomb. Then he’d be trapped in the 
two inner tanks to be dealt with at 
leisure. 

He unsealed the suit to get at his 
laser pistol. If it came to a shoot- 
out, he hoped his light-headedness 
wouldn’t slow his reflexes or af- 
fect his aim. He felt pretty well, 
but anoxia was deceptive. He was 
finished, of course. But he wanted 
very badly to take a few of them 
with him at the last; not just be 
stepped on, like a bug. 

As he drew the pistol his hand 



GREE'S HELLCATS 



79 




brushed against the brain-gadgets in 
his pocket. He grinned. It would 
be a nice irony if he could use 
their own invention to bolster up 
his reflexes and help him get one or 
two of them. He glanced at the 
timer. He didn’t think the bomb 
was due for another half minute, or 
possibly two-thirds. With awkward 
fingers, he got the gadgets out and 
shoved them inside his helmet, jam- 
med them up until they were at his 
temples. He was very careful not 
to think any hostile thoughts against 
Gree; he concentrated hard on self- 
preservation. He sealed the suit 
again and reached for the hatch con- 
trol. 

“Are you sure ” the soundless 
voice murmured in his head, “that 
you've thought of every resource?” 
Annoyed, though he knew he was 
only hearing thoughts dredged from 
his own subconscious, he said aloud, 
“I’ve let out every bit of air except 
what’s in this compartment and in 
my suit. That wouldn’t last more 
than a few seconds!” 

“Are you sure?” the voice per- 
sisted. “What is air?” 

“A gas, of course!” he snorted 
angrily, and reached again for the 
control. 

“What is a gas?” 

“Damn it!” he snarled — then 
went silent, gaping. A gas is . 
something in the gaseous state. 

H e darted a look at the timer, at 
the outside-pressure gauge, at 
another gauge. The calm that had 



settled over him with his acceptance 
of doom shattered. An awful anxiety 
replaced it; an actual physical ache. 
He leaped for the console. Would 
he have time? 

Vaporized water is a gas; and the 
ship’s tanks held over seven hundred 
gallons of water. 

He felt the new vibration as water 
spewed out. He stared at the timer’s 
second hand as if that were the thing 
that controlled fate. The outside 
viewer showed vapor curling from 
the floor, to be whisked away by 
the pumps. More water poured out 
and bubbled on the tank’s floor, 
soaking up calories from the steel. 
The whole tank began to fog. He 
was laughing aloud now, not quite 
sanely. The pressure gauge crawled 
away from zero. 

He leaned over the computer key- 
board, but before he could touch the 
keys the brain-gadgets were already 
computing: “At Terrestrial sea level , 
standard conditions , one volume of 
water yields eighteen hundred vol- 
umes of vapor . .” 

It turned out that he had more 
than enough. Impudently, ignoring 
the Gree voice that suddenly shout- 
ed at him again, he closed the dump 
valves and saved two hundred gal- 
lons. 

Presently he nulled to safety. 

He removed the gadgets from his 
helmet and held them in his hand, 
hoping the Birds would let him join 
the testing and experimentation. He 
could think of some fascinating pos- 
sibilities, END

IF • Short Story 




by JOHN McCALLUM 



The kids fust loved having 
guests . It was wonderful of 
Earth to keep sending theml 



T he sun poured heat that shim- 
mered and rolled across the 
Martian desert. It hammered and 
burned the man stumbling across 
the loose red sand. 

The man moved very slowly and 
he fell often. And each time he fell 
he lay face down with the sun hot 
on his head and the smell of ancient 
dust in his nostrils and he thought 
about not getting up again. But al- 
ways the heat, and his thirst, and 
the fear of death drove him. 

He had been walking for three 
days, seeing nothing but sand and 
sky and the sun that was killing 
him. He found the glass house on 
the morning of the fourth day. 

The house looked like an inverted 
bowl. Forty feet in diameter, it rose 
to a height of twenty feet in a flaw- 
less curve. The glass had a bluish 
tint. 



The man kept on the sand and 

waited for the house to vanish. It 
didn’t, and he got up and walked un- 
steadily towards it. 

The dome seemed to resist the 
full glare of the sun, filtering out 
the harshness and letting in a soft 
light that looked cool and inviting. 
The interior walls were a solid dark- 
er blue. 

The man staggered the last few 
yards and sprawled on the sand. He 
lay gasping in the thin air. After 
awhile he raised his head. 

T wo children were standing in- 
side the wall watching him. A 
boy and a girl. The girl looked about 
five years old. Dark hair cut short. 
Cute. She wore a short dress and 
sandals. 

The boy looked about a year older. 
Dark curly hair like the girl. Short

pants, sandals, short-sleeved shirt. 
Cool. A handsome little boy. 

The man lay still. He watched 
the children. 

They smiled at him. 

He climbed painfully to his 
knees. His body was stiff and his 
tongue felt like a mouthful of bro- 
ken glass. 

The little boy spoke. “What are 
you doing out there?” 

The man smiled at the children 
and got slowly to his feet. His head 
filled with a thundering noise and 
blackness rolled across his eyes. He 
leaned his hands on the wall, feeling 
the smooth glass as though it was 
miles away while the desert tilted 
and rolled. His vision cleared and 
gradually the dizziness passed. 

The children watched him. 

“Hello,” he said. His voice crack- 
ed and his head felt strange. 

“Who are you?” the little boy ask- 
ed. 

“My name is Price. I crashed here. 
Look — I need water! Let me in, 
will you?” 

The little girl smiled up at him, 
her face curious and her eyes big 
and friendly. “Why are you out- 
side? Aren’t you hot?” 

“I sure am. Listen, I need water 
in the worst way. Let me in.” 

“Who are you?” the little boy 
asked. 

“I told you. My name is Price. 
John Price. I crashed here. Just 
let me in and I’ll tell you all about 
it.” 

“Why are you outside?” the lit- 
tle girl asked. “Aren’t you hot?” 

“Yes. Of course I’m hot. Listen, 
if you’ll just . 



“Who are you?” the little boy 
asked. 

“I told you. Price. John Price. 
Look, it’s a long story.” He licked 
his cracked lips. His tongue felt 
thick and swollen. “I crashed here, 
see? I’m from Earth. Earth, not 
Mars. I walked across the desert. 
I’ve got to . .” 

“You shouldn’t be outside,” the 
little girl said. “It’s too hot.” 

“I know that. I don’t . .” 

“Who are you?” 

“I told you who I am,” Price 
shouted. He broke down coughing. 
The shouting hurt his throat. “Listen! 
I’ve got to have water right now. 
Let me in and I’ll . .” 

“Do you like it outside?” 

“No!” Price screamed. “Christ, 
no!” He put his face close to the 
wall. “Listen! Go tell your mother! 
Tell her ...” 

A woman walked into the room. 
Thirtyish and pretty. Her dark hair 
was cropped short and curled loose- 
ly against her head. She wore a 
short dress, light blue like the house 
and belted at the waist. 

She smiled at Price, nodding po- 
litely. “Come on, you kids,” she 
said. “Get your breakfast.” 

“Aw, Mom.” 

“Come on. You can talk after- 
wards.” She took the children’s 
hands and smiled apologetically at 
Price. 

“Lady, listen to me. Please. I’ve 
got to . .” 

They walked out of the room. 

P rice stared after them in amaze- 
ment. He hit the wall. “For 
Christ’s sake, what’s the matter with

you? Are you all deaf? Let me in!” 
He pushed away from the wall and 
started around the house. He stum- 
bled and sprawled full length in the 
loose sand. He rested and then 
climbed painfully to his feet. He 
walked slowly and carefully around 
the house to the dining room and 
looked in. 

The woman and children were 
seated at a table. Eating breakfast. 
They drank water out of tall glass- 
es. The center of the table held a 
big curved pitcher brimming with 
water and ice cubes. 

The little girl emptied her glass 
and refilled it. She turned and wav- 
ed to Price. 

His legs felt like dry rubber. He 
leaned against the wall and stared at 
the glass in the little girl’s hand. She 
raised her glass to her mouth and 
drank noisily. Water trickled down 
her chin to her neck. She wiped her 
mouth with a chubby hand. 

“Don’t drink so fast,” her mother 
said. “You’ll get a tummy ache.” 
“I don’t drink too fast,” the little 
boy said. “Do I, Mom?” 

“No, honey. That’s fine.” 

“She should be more polite. Eh, 
Mom?” 

“I am so polite,” the little girl 
protested. “I am! Aren’t I, Mum- 
my?” 

“Yes, sweetheart. You’re polite. 
You’re both polite. Now hurry up 
and finish your breakfast.” 

Price hammered the wall with the 
palm of his hand. It made a soft 
padded sound. “Hey, lady! Let me 
in! I need water.” 

She picked up her glass. 

“I’ve got to have water!” 



She looked at the little boy and 
said, “Hurry up now.” 

“Lady, please! For God’s sake! 
I need water. I’ll die!” 

She put her glass to her mouth 
and sipped at it. 

Price kicked the wall. He pressed 
against it, hitting it with both hands. 
“Open up!” he screamed. “I’m 
thirsty, I tell you. I need water!” 
He hammered the wall, kicking and 
pounding at it in fear and fury. He 
filled his lungs and screamed as hard 
as he could. 

She finished her drink and put her 
glass aside. 

He slumped to the sand. Tired, 
he thought. I’m tired, too. This isn’t 
doing me any good. 

He got to his feet again and 
began circling the house, examining 
the wall, looking for a door. He 
walked around the house without 
finding an opening in the smooth 
glass. 

He hit the wall. “Hey! Let me in! 
I need water.” 

Nothing. 

He sat on the sand. “Alright,” he 
muttered. “You’ve got to look this 
way sometime. I’ll wait here till you 
do.” 

The sun was hot. He sat on the 
sand and looked into the house and 
thought of all the water he had 
swam in and waded through and 
sailed over. His eyes were hot and 
his body sagged. Tiny fingers of 
fear and urgency plucked at him, 
but he drove them back and closed 
his eyes and thought about water- 
falls and lawn sprinklers and grass 
cut short with the dew clinging to 
it.

kids want any more 
y water?” The woman’s ques- 
tion came faintly to him. 

“No, Mom.” The little boy had a 
nice clear voice. 

“I’ll throw it out then.” 

He jerked his head up. Ten feet 
away a door had opened in the glass 
wall. The woman stood in the open- 
ing. She held the pitcher in her hand. 

“Wait!” Price called. 

The woman poured the water on- 
to the sand. She shook the pitcher. 

Price dragged himself to his 
knees. “Wait!” he called. 

The woman stepped back into the 
house. 

His thirst and his fear and the 
screaming of his arid body rushed 
at him and he scrambled to his 
feet. “Wait!” He stumbled for the 
opening in the wall. 

It swung shut. 

Price pushed on the glass. There 
was no sign where the door had 
been. He pounded the wall weakly. 
“Wait!” he croaked. “Let me in. 
Please.” 

The woman placed the empty 
pitcher on the table. She sat down, 
her back to Price. 

He wheeled around, searching for 
where the water had landed. The 
snot looked dark. He dropped prone 
and pressed his mouth to the desert. 
He dug his tongue into it, feeling for 
moisture. Hp clawed at it. The sand 
was dry. He opened his mouth wide 
and bit into the sand and it filled 
his mouth and tore his cracked lips. 
He inhaled, clutched his throat and 
coughed in agony. He lay with his 
face on the desert and coughed up 
the lining of his throat. 



After a while he turned his head 
and looked into the house. The chil- 
dren were standing inside the wall 
watching him. 

The little girl smiled shyly. “You 
shouldn’t eat sand,” she said. “It isn’t 
good for you.” She turned to the 
boy and said, “It isn’t good to eat 
sand, is it?” 

“Gosh, no,” he said. He looked 
curiously at Price. “Why do you eat 
it?” 

Price looked at the children. Heat 
rolled over him in suffocating waves. 
He got to his hands and knees and 
crawled to the wall. 

“Why do you eat sand?” the little 
boy said. 

Price examined the friendly little 
faces. “Don’t you understand?” he 
said. He looked at the girl. “Can’t 
you see? I’m dying out here.” 

“Sand isn’t good for you.” 

“Please give me water. Just a 
little.” 

“You shouldn’t eat sand.” 

“Please.” 

“Why do you eat it?” 

He fell against the wall. He 
coughed. Blood from his cracked lips 
and torn throat sprayed the glass. 
He pressed his mouth to the wall 
and pawed weakly at it. 

“Maybe he likes sand.” 

He began to whisper. He pressed 
his mouth to the wall and whispered 
and each time he exhaled it made a 
rasping sound in his throat and 
blood smeared on the glass. 

“Do you like sand, Mister?” 

He slumped sideways to the des- 
ert. His head dropped and his eyes 
closed. The sand burned his cheek 
but he had no strength so he lay

there and after a while his mind 
drifted. His body felt dry, but his 
mind found lakes of blue and 
streams that raced over big round 
boulders and shimmered cold and 
wet under the shade of green trees. 
He slept. 

H e woke to heat. Blind, inhuman 
heat. The sun seared him. Heat 
reflected from the sand like a blast 
furnace. He dragged his eyes open, 
the lids like hot lead weights. He lay 
still. Not moving and breathing shal- 
lowly. 

Dry. Dry, he thought. The abso- 
lute ultimate. The absolute, absolute 
ultimate of dry sticks and stones and 
bones and bones. His thoughts flut- 
tered and sank and flopped in the 
heat. And sticks and stones and 
dry, dry bones. He opened his mouth 
and his lips split. He rolled his eyes 
slowly without moving his head. 
The woman was standing beside him 
on the sand. 

“Are you all right?” she said. 

He moved his mouth but no sound 
came out. 

“Are you all right?” 

His mouth moved jerkily. “Wath.” 
“Pardon?” 

“Watha.” 

The woman smiled kindly. “You 
had us worried,” she said. “I’m glad 
you’re all right.” 

“Water.” 

“We thought maybe you were 
sick or something.” 

He pushed himself to his hands 
and knees. His arms shook and the 
desert turned over. “Water,” he 
whispered. He crawled to the wom- 
an. “Please.” 



“The children will be glad to see 
you.” She turned and walked back 
into the house. The door closed. 

Price crawled to the wall. The 
children had a tub of water. The 
boy was pushing a toy sailing ship 
across the surface. His hands were 
wet. Water sloshed over the rim of 
the tub and ran on the floor. 

The little girl waved to Price. 
“Hi,” she called. “I’m glad you’re 
all right again. We thought you were 
sick.” 

Price looked at the water. “Help 

__ _ » 

me. 

“We’re playing boats.” 

“Please help me.” 

The little boy took the boat out 
of the water and held it up for Price 
to see. Water ran down his arm. 
The boat was bright blue. The sail 
was white. 

Price coughed. Blood flecked the 
wall. 

The little boy smiled broadly. 
“I’ve got a boat.” 

“Please.” 

“Mom got it for me.” 

“Can’t you hear me?” Price look- 
ed at the children. “Do you know 
what I’m saying?” 

“Of course it’s only a toy.” 

“Come here.” He motioned for 
them to come over. 

The children looked at him 
curiously. 

He motioned again. 

They walked over and stood 
against the wall. 

Price got to his feet. It took him 
a long while and the exertion made 
his head spin. He leaned his hand 
on the glass and bent towards the 
little boy. “Can you hear me?” 



OUR MARTIAN NEIGHBORS 



85 




The little boy smiled at him. His 
•yes were warm and he had a dimple 
on one cheek when he smiled. 

Price looked at the girl. “Can 
you hear me? Nod your head if you 
ean. 

The little girl smiled shyly. 
“You can’t hear me,” Price said. 
“You can’t hear me at all, can you?” 
The children smiled politely. 
Friendly. 

P rice dropped to his knees. 

“Look,” he said. He smoothed 
out a patch of sand. He drew a 
circle with his finger. “Sun,” he 
•aid. He pointed to the sun, then to 
Ibe circle he had drawn. “Sun,” he 
repeated. He pointed to the sun 
again, then down to the circle. 

The children looked curious. 

He drew four smaller circles out 
from the big one. 

“He’s drawing,” the boy said. 
Price pointed to himself. He 
touched his chest with his hand, 
then pointed to the third small circle. 

“What’s he drawing?” the little 
girl asked. 

Price pointed to himself again. He 
touched his chest and said, “Me.” 
He pointed to the third small circle 
and said, “Earth.” 

“It’s a ball,” the little boy said. 
“He’s drawing a ball.” 

Price pointed to the third cir- 
cle. “Earth,”- he said. “I’m from 
Earth.” 

“A ball, a ball,” the little girl 
sang. She jumped up and down and 
clapped her hands. “He’s drawing 
a ball.” 

Price ignored her. He pointed to 
the fourth circle. “Mars,” he said. 



He pointed to the children. He 
pointed to the sand. He pointed to 
the house. He swung his arm, point- 
ing to the expanse of desert, then 
pointed again to the fourth circle. 
“Mars,” he said. 

The children watched him. 

He pointed again to himself, then 
to the third circle. He moved his 
finger in an arc from the third cir- 
cle to the fourth one. He jabbed 
his finger into the fourth circle, 
crumpling his hand against the sand. 
“Crashed,” he said. He made walk- 
ing motions with his fingers up to 
the glass wall and stopped. He look- 
ed up at the children. 

“Draw a boat,” the little boy said. 

Price leaned against the wall. 
The sun was directly overhead now, 
pouring heat like a giant blowtorch. 
His thoughts drained away. The sun 
covered him and devoured him while 
the desert shimmered and blackness 
rolled in with sleep and surrender. 

He wrenched his mind back. He 
got up again, swaying weakly on 
his feet. “Look,” he said. He held 
his hand out in front of him, his 
fingers bent as though holding a 
glass. He made turning motions 
above it with his other hand. He 
raised his hand to his mouth and 
pretended to drink. His split lips 
bled slightly. The blood caked on his 
mouth and when he swallowed it felt 
like his throat was being cut. 

The children stared blankly. 

H e repeated the process. “Water,” 
he said. 

The little girl tilted her head to 
one side and surveyed him care- 
fully

Price pointed to the tub of water. 
He drew an imaginary pitcher in the 
air and pretended to pour from it. 
He drew a glass and pretended to 
hold it. He pointed again to the tub 
of water. 

The little girl’s eyes widened. She 
beamed. She walked over to the 
table and picked up a glass half full 
of water. 

Price pulled his mouth into a 
smile. He pointed to himself. 

The little girl nodded triumphant- 
ly. She walked back to the wall, 
holding out the glass like a banner 
and smiling broadly. 

Price opened his black lips and 
pointed down his throat. 

The little girl drank the water. 

Price stared incredulously at her. 
He looked at the empty glass in her 
hand. “No,” he said. “For me.” 
He fell to his knees and pressed his 
face to the hot glass wall. “Please,” 
he croaked. “Please.” 

The woman walked into the 
room. She smiled at Price. “Come 
on, you kids,” she said. “Clean up 
your room. You can talk later.” 

“We’re talking to our friend, 
Mummy.” 

“I know, honey. You can talk 
to him later. Clean up your room 
now.” She turned to Price and 
smiled politely. “Those two would 
talk all day if you let them.” 

Price pawed at the wall. He was 
smearing more blood on the glass. 
“Please,” he whispered. 

“But it’s nice of you to visit.” 

He coughed violently. A long 
heaving cough that came from deep 
inside and blew clotted blood against 
the back of his teeth. 



“You seem to have made a big 
hit with them.” 

He fell over sideways. Sand stuck 
to his mouth like red cement. 

“I better get some work done 
myself.” 

It was hard to think because his 
brain was dry and his body felt far 
away and when he closed hi$ eyes 
he couldn’t feel the sand. 

“I’m complaining abo\it the kids,” 
she laughed, “and here I am gabbing 
myself.” 

He seemed to be sliding down a 
long dry tunnel. The sides of the 
tunnel were made of stucco and they 
scraped and tore his skin. He looked 
back up the tunnel and a great 
black cloud was rushing after him. 
He went faster and faster and the 
stucco side tore big pieces of meat 
out of him that burned but didn’t 
bleed because he was too dry and he 
was turning over slowly and his face 
was scraping the tunnel and his 
mouth wouldn’t close because his 
tongue was too big and no matter 
how fast he went the black cloud 
went faster and it was all dry too. 

“We’ll see you later.” 

Blackness covered him. 

T hey watched him for a long 
while. Finally the woman 
spoke. “I think he’s dead.” 

“No,” the boy said. 

“I think so.” 

“He can’t be.” 

“Stay here. I’ll go see.” 

“He isn’t dead.” 

“I’ll go look.” 

The woman walked out of the 
house and the children followed her 
to the doorway. She walked over

to Price. She hooked a foot under 
him and rolled him on to his back. 
His head flopped loosely. His tongue 
protruded and his eyes were vacant. 

She bent down and looked close- 
ly at him. “He’s dead.” Her voice 
was different and she wasn’t pretty. 

“Are you sure?” 

“Yes.”". 

Th§; little one walked towards 
Price. His eyes were funny and he 
didn’t look like a little boy any 
more. His arms were changing, and 
he didn’r have ^fingers. His skin was 
becoming slate blue. “That was too 
quick,” he snapped. > ' 

“I know.” 

As the house disappeared, the 
little one walked over to Price’s 
body and kicked him on the head. 
He muttered something obscene and 
kicked him again and again. He 
rained kicks on Price’s head and on 



his open mouth and his open sight- 
less eyes. 

He kicked him in cold deliberate 
fury and Price’s head bounced and 
made soggy noises. 

The big one pulled him back gent- 
ly. “He can’t feel it anymore,” she 
said, and looked up. The land- 
scape was flickering back to some- 
thing closer to its realty. There was 
something like a tree, and some- 
thing like a hill. The home was 
gone. 

“But what’ll we do now?” the 
little Martian screamed* ^There’s 
nothing more to play with.’' 

The big Martian stroked his head 
and said, “Be patient.” She looked 
up at the sky and smiled softly. 
“Look,” she said, as a distant line 
of fire streamed down the strange, 
pale sky. “There’s another coming 
now.” END

WHITE FANG 
GOES DINGO

M y name is White Fang, though 
of course that is not really 
my name. At least not any more. 
Now my name is Dennis White. I 
like the old name better, but I sup- 
pose that comes of having been a 



pet. Some people would say tha* 
once you’ve been a pet, once you’ve 
grown used to a Leash, you’re never 
quite human again. I don’t know 
about that. Of course, it is more fun. 
But one can learn not to want it 
so badly. I did. And this is the 
story of how I did it. As a puppy. 

3V-. 



89 



Ah, how is one to speak of the 
old times without slipping into the 
old way of speaking? But am I 
then to speak like a Dingo? No! 
The memoirs of a member of Louis 
XVI’s court could not be set down 
in the rough accents of a sans-culot- 
te — and / must be allowed to write 
of White Fang as White Fang would 
have written of himself. For the 
time being let me leave Dennis 
White in abeyance — and let me 
say, without more preamble, that 
as a puppy I was uncommonly 
happy. 

How should it have been other- 
wise? I was raised in the best ken- 
nels of the solar system. My young 
body was sportive — and so it 
sported. My education ranged freely 
through the humanities, and yet I 
was never forced beyond my inclina- 
tions. I enjoyed the company of my 
own kind as well as the inestimable 
pleasures of the Leash. Finally, I 
was conscious of possessing the high- 
est pedigree. My father was a ma- 
jor artist — perhaps the major art- 
ist — in a society that valued art 
above all other things. No little bit 
of his glory rubbed off on me. 
Later, in adolescence, a father’s 
fame may cramp the growing ego, 
but then it was enough to know that 
I was as valuable a pet as there 
could be. In what else does happi- 
ness consist than in this — a sense 
of one’s own value? Not in free- 
dom, surely. 

If I had been free in my youth, 
I would almost certainly not have 
been so happy. 

In fact there was a time when I 
might have been said to be free 



(I thought of it then as neglect ), 
and I resented my condition bitter- 
ly. It happened shortly after I had 
been orphaned — that is to say, 
after the Dingoes had made away 
with my father. I was seven then. 
But let me set about this in a more 
chronological fashion: 

Let me make a narrative of this. 

1 suppose I should begin with my 
parents, Tennyson White and 
Clea Melbourne Clift. Clea, who 
would never let us call her Mother, 
did not marry Daddy, in the usual 
sense of the word. Like so many 
women of her generation, the first 
to grow up under the Mastery, Clea 
was something of a blue stocking 
and very jealous of her indepen- 
dence. For Clea to marry and take 
on the name of White would have 
been in contradiction to the first 
article of her faith: that the sexes 
must be equal in all things. 

Neither I nor my older brother 
Pluto knew how to behave around 
Clea. She didn’t want us to think 
of her as a mother, but more as a 
sort of friend of the family. When 
Daddy disappeared, Clea went off 
somewhere — outside the solar sys- 
tem — and we never heard from 
her again. She had taken up with 
Daddy because of his literary repu- 
tation. A lot of women did, but 
she was his favorite, for the simple 
reason that she was what a Dingo 
would call a “knock-out.” Daddy, 
on the other hand, was sort of thin 
and pale and poetical. He wore his 
hair almost as long as hers. I never 
knew either of them really well. 

I think I’ve already mentioned 



90 



IF 




that Daddy disappeared when I was 
seven years old. We were on Earth, 
Daddy, Pluto, and I, living in the 
open country near one of the Din- 
goes’ towns. Daddy was research- 
ing another book, a sequel to A 
Dog’s Life , and he’d go off on long 
walks without a Leash. Sometimes 
he would be loose for weeks at a 
time if his work demanded it. He 
had to understand what it was to 
be merely human. So, when the 
Dingoes got hold of him, the Mas- 
ters couldn’t do anything. They’d 
lost touch. No body was ever found, 
but one could assume that the 
Dingoes had been thorough in dis- 
posing of the remains, for the Mas- 
ters could have resurrected a body 
from hamburger almost. 

Pluto and I were placed in a 
kennel located on the North Shore 
of Lake Superior, the Shroeder Ken- 
nel, and there we remained for the 
next three years, and there we were 
neglected. 

In a purely physical sense, we 
were well cared for. I’ll grant that. 
The Shroeder Kennel (named for a 
little town that had once occupied 
that site) had an excellent gym- 
nasium, warm and cold pools, in- 
door tennis and golf courts, good 
robotic instructors for all sports, 
and the kennel rations were prepar- 
ed with that exquisite simplicity that 
only the most refined taste can com- 
mand. Our rooms, both public and 
private, were spacious, airy, and 
bright. Naturalness was everywhere, 
the style of the thing, and it was no 
less natural for being adjusted to 
our convenience. Thus, in the sum- 
mer the air was filtered and cooled, 



and in the winter the dome that 
encompassed the kennel heated us 
and added extra hours of sunlight 
to the brief northern days. The dome 
delimiting the kennels was a mile 
in diameter, and within its bounds 
our comforts were secure against the 
enmity of the Dingoes. 

It would have been an ideal exis- 
tence if only our Master had truly 
cared for us. 

Not that he should have cared. 
Why should people care for dogs or 
cats or parakeets? But they do, and 
the dogs and cats and parakeets 
have come to expect it. They like 
to be talked to, fondled, taken for 
walks, and, in general, treated as 
equals, though it must be evident, 
even to their limited sensibilities, 
that they aren’t equal; men are im- 
measurably their superiors, possess- 
ing inexplicable powers and engag- 
ing in unaccountable pursuits. 

The analogy (which I have bor- 
rowed from Daddy’s novel, A Dog’s 
Life) to the relation between Mas- 
ters and men can be extended al- 
most indefinitely. Mankind cannot 
presume to understand or equal the 
Masters. Their nature is so alien to 
ours that, unassisted, we cannot 
even perceive them. As nearly as we 
can know, the Masters are pure 
electromagnetic phenomena — form- 
ed of a “substance” that is neither 
matter nor energy but rather a po- 
tentiality for either. Their power ap- 
proaches cosmic proportions, and 
their knowledge approaches omni- 
science. 

Beside them mankind is insignifi- 
cant and laughable. Considered simp- 
ly as a field of force, they are, cor- 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 



91 




porately, of a scope and dimension 
equal at least to the magnetic field 
of the Earth. In the strictest sense 
of the word, the Masters are unac- 
countable. One could only accept 
them, reverence them, and hope for 
the best. 

T he best that one could hope for 
was the Leash. The Leash, 
however, is — it was — rather hard 
to describe: the tides of knowledge 
that sweep through the mind, the 
total certainty that it affords, the 
ecstasy. Naturally, it didn’t always 
reach those proportions. Often it 
was only a diffuse sense of well- 
being. But it could be the Beatific 
Vision. It was not as some say, a 
telepathic link with the Masters. 
(Although they could speak to us 
only when we were Leashed, and 
their speech was a direct communi- 
cation from their mind to ours.) It 
was simply their touch , a touch that 
could transmute our nervous system 
from base lead to gleaming gold — 
or scramble a brain into idiocy — 
with, literally, the speed of light- 
ning. 

Desirable as the Leash was, one 
could not coerce it. Like the state of 
grace, it came as a gift or not at 
all. And at the Schroeder Kennel it 
came not at all — or so rarely as 
to make its general absence only 
more poignant. Our Master simply 
did not care; he was not interested 
enough in his pets to spend his 
time with them, and so we were left 
to our own devices. It was a terrible 
way to grow up. 

And so we come to Roxanna 
Proust. 



I don’t think Proust was really her 
last name, any more than my name 
was White Fang. She had taken the 
name, because Proust was her idol. 
She was only eighteen at the time 
that we entered the Shroeder Ken- 
nel, and already the Remembrance 
of Things Past was her passion and 
pasttime. 

Roxanna was, faute de mieux, our 
teacher. She taught us French, read- 
ing to us from her favorite author, 
and she taught us German by read- 
ing a German translation of Proust. 
It was a rather eclectic education, 
but there was no one else with a 
fraction of Roxanna’s talent, special 
as it was. Most of the pets there 
were only interested in athletics and 
flirtation. For my own part, I’ll con- 
fess that I spent much more time in 
the gymnasium than I did at my 
studies. Without the intellectual 
stimulation and aid of the Leash, 
literature has not been my natural 
inclination. 

Pluto was different. Pluto loved 
to read, and, under Roxanna’s guid- 
ance, he began to write. Not sur- 
prisingly, his style was very deriva- 
tive of Proust’s. Later, it was de- 
rivative of Joyce, and at last, when 
he became famous, it was entirely 
original. Or so I am told. I’ve never 
been able to understand him unless 
I was Leashed, and then, of course, 
I can understand anything. In fact, 
if I were to be candid, I would have 
to admit that my brother and I 
have always been rather distant. That 
at least prevented us from being 
hostile. I understand that Pluto, like 
our mother, has left the solar system. 
He is no longer on Earth, in any

case, and I can’t say that I’ve 
missed him that much. 

U 

I have always considered that my 
life began at the age of ten. Be- 
fore that age, I remember few 
events in any detail. From ten on, 
1 think I could reconstruct the hap- 
pening of each new day if I had to. 

The day it would give me most 
pleasure to reconstruct was the 4th 
of October, 2023 — a Wednesday. 
On that day in good weather Roxan- 
na would take Pluto and me out in- 
to the country, beyond the dome 
of the kennel. After a half-hour 
drive along dirt roads, we would ar- 
rive at a deserted farm, where, in 
the shade of overburdened apple 
trees, we would pursue our studies, 
or, if Roxanna felt indulgent toward 
us, we would explore the old farm 
buildings. We never went into the 
house itself, though. The aura of 
Dingoes still clung to it. 

Only years later did Roxanna re- 
veal to me that this was her par- 
ents’ farm, abandoned during the 
Great Collapse of 2012, when the 
economy of those humans who were 
still holding out against the Mas- 
tery fell completely into ruin. The 
Nelsons (for that was the name on 
the mailbox — not Proust) had 
volunteered . themselves and their 
children for the Shroeder Kennel. 
The children had been accepted, but 
the parents had been turned away, 
as by that time most older volun- 
teers were. The Masters had no more 
need of wild pets, for now they 
bred their own. 



It was principally from rejects like 
the Nelsons that the society of Din- 
goes, as we know it today, evolved, 
and Roxanna herself was not free 
from the taint (or so I regarded 
it then) of their wildness. How 
else was one to interpret these will- 
ful visits to the scene of her child- 
hood — visits in which she in- 
volved Pluto and me with such 
blithe disregard for our safety or 
moral well-being. The countryside 
was swarming with Dingoes even 
then (had not I lost my father to 
them?), and we three pets could 
have been abused or abducted with- 
out fear of reprisals. That our Mas- 
ter should have allowed us to ven- 
ture so far, Unleashed and running 
wild, is indicative of the state of af- 
fairs at Shroeder Kennel. 

It was late in the afternoon, and 
Roxanna, tired of reading, was lazily 
reminiscing to Pluto about her coun- 
try childhood and how different the 
world had been then. I was above 
them in the branches of the ap- 
ple tree, working problems in long 
division. Suddenly there appeared, 
suspended in mid-air almost near 
enough for me to touch, a girl of 
about my own age. Wisps of helio- 
trope spiralled about her, and her 
hair gleamed in the dying sunlight 
as though it were itself luminescent. 

“Hello,” she said. “My name is 
Julie. Don’t you want to play?” 

I could not reply. I was stunned 
as much by her loveliness (Yes, I 
was only ten, but children are not 
insensible of these things — perhaps 
not so much as we are.) as by the 
shock of meeting a stranger in those 
unlikely circumstances. 



94 



IF 




She took a step toward me, smil- 
ing (Julie has always had the love- 
liest, cheek-dimpling smile), and I 
realized what would have been im- 
mediately evident to any other pet: 
that it was her Master’s unseen pre- 
sence that supported her. For him, 
anti-gravity would be a moment’s 
improvisation. But our Master’s neg- 
lect had made even such common- 
places as flights seem rare to us. 

“Aren’t you Leashed?” she asked, 
when she saw that I was not about 
to leave my branch and meet her 
halfway. 

“No, none of us are.” 

B y this time Roxanna and Pluto 
had become aware of our visi- 
tor, but since they were a good ten 
feet below Julie and me, it was 
awkward for them to join the con- 
versation. It was awkward for me, 
for that matter, but I blustered on. 

“Would you like an apple?” I 
asked, picking one from the abun- 
dance about me and offering it to 
her. She stretched forth her hand, 
then, with a guilty look, drew it back. 

“My Master thinks I’d best not,” 
she explained. “He says that sort of 
food is for Dingoes. You’re not a 
Dingo, are you?” 

“Oh no!” I blushed, though I knew 
she was only trying to make a joke. 
There could be no serious doubt of 
our domestication, for Dingoes wear 
clothing, while pets (who have bet- 
ter bodies, usually) only dress for 
formal occasions: the theatre or a 
pageant. 

“Would you like to slip in with 
me?” She held out her hand, and 
eagerly I jumped off the branch 

WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 



and was buoyed up in the gravity 
belt supporting Julie. I felt the mesh- 
es of a Leash close over my mind, 
and Julie, giggling with delight, leap- 
ed into the accommodating air to 
a height of thirty feet, and hung 
there, secure as a ping-pong ball 
suspended by a jet of air. 

“Try and catch me!” she shouted 
and then dashed behind the sagging 
roof of the old barn. 

“What about me?” Pluto protested. 

“You’re probably too old, but I’ll 
ask her,” I promised and disappear- 
ed from sight. She led me quite a 
chase, but it was such a pleasure to 
be able to fly again that I kept up 
with her effortlessly. 

The Leash that I shared with 
Julie was loose — that is, it was not 
so intense that one wished to do no 
more than contemplate the mysteries 
of life and Leash. One simply felt 
euphoric, zesty, and raring to go. 

Once I had caught her, I made her 
explain what she was doing out 
here at the Nelson farm. It was 
not, after all, a crossroads. Julie ex- 
plained that her Master had brought 
her to Earth to help choose new 
stock for his kennel in the asteroid 
belt. My eyes kindled with the hope 
that she might choose me. The ken- 
nels outside of the Earth, especially 
those beyond Mars, were known to 
be superior to Earthside kennels, and 
I longed to have a Master who 
would care for me. 

Julie seemed to understand this, 
for she didn’t keep me in suspense. 
“You will come back with us, won’t 
you?” she asked, and her Master’s 
voice resonated in my mind, echoing 
her plea: Won't you? 

95 




Her Master? No — now he was 
mine! 

“Why did you come out here?” 
I asked. “Surely, you don’t have time 
to look at all the pets on Earth.” 

“Because of who you are.” 

“Who are we?” I was sincerely 
puzzled. 

“Only the sons of the most famous 
novelist in the last fifty years. That’s 
all. It’s incredible that every kennel 
in the solar system isn’t trying to 
snap you up.” 

It was easy at Shroeder Kennels, 
where Roxanna was the only pet with 
a literary bent, and that so singular- 
ly directed, for Pluto and I to for- 
get the extent of our father’s fame. 
A Dog's Life had been, after all, an 
epoch-making book — like Luther’s 
Bible or Das Kapital. Even the Mas- 
ters had read and admired it. Daddy 
had won the Nobel Prize, entered 
the French Academy, and been 
elected to the American Senate. 
More than any other person, he had 
affected the reconciliation of men 
and the Masters, and it was for 
that reason that the Dingoes had 
marked him for vengeance. It was 
his book, in fact, that had given 
the Dingoes their name. 

The wonder of that novel is that 
it’s told entirely from a dog’s point 
of view — a real dog. Before A 
Dog's Life , the Dingoes had used 
words like “kennel,” “Leash,” and 
even “pet” as invective. After Dad- 
dy’s book, the tables were turned: 
Daddy’s terminology stuck. Every- 
one — that is to say, all the pets 
— began to name their children after 
famous dogs. There hasn’t been a 
generation of puppies with stranger 
r

names since the Pilgrim Fathers 
went off the deep end back in the 
Seventeenth Century. 

Which brings us back to Julie 
and me. “I’ve told you my name,” 
she said. “But you haven’t told me 
yours. 

“White Fang,” I said, proudly. 
“White Fang,” she repeated, cud- 
dling up to me. “I don’t see you as 
‘White Fang’ at all. I’m going to 
call you Cuddles.” 

1 should have objected then and 
there, but I was anxious lest I 
offend Julie and lose my ticket to 
the asteroids. And so it was that 
for the next ten years of my life I 
was known as Cuddles to all my 
friends. 

Within hours of our return to the 
kennel, Julie’s Master had negotiated 
the transfer of myself and Pluto 
from the Shroeder Kennel to outer 
space. Roxanna was very curt in her 
farewells. It was only natural that 
she should be disappointed at being 
left behind, but there was nothing 
to be done. Her pedigree was un- 
exceptional, and her literary attain- 
ments, though they shone in the 
intellectual night of the Shroeder 
Kennel, were not really of the first 
magnitude when yotr looked at them 
from a greater distance. 

The trip to the asteroids was made 
that night as we slept. What means 
our Master employed to transport us, 
I could not say. Nothing so crude 
as a spaceship. The Master’s technol- 
ogy is a spur-of-the-moment thing, 
and I will admit, for my own part, 
that mechanical engineering isn’t 
really that interesting to me. 



IF 




We woke to the subdued lumines- 
cence of kennel walls that we had 
known for years. The walls shifted 
to livelier color schemes in response 
to the quickening neural patterns of 
our waking minds. It was just like 
home. 

But there was a difference: instead 
of the relentless drag of Earth-gravi- 
ty there was a gentle gravitational 
pulse, a relaxed ebb and flow that 
seemed to issue from my own heart. 

I felt the Leash of my new Mas- 
ter close tighter over my mind (for 
the next ten years it would never 
entirely desert me, even in sleep), 
and I smiled and whispered my 
thanks to him for having brought 
me away. 

Julie was awake now, also, and 
with a wave of her arm and a flour- 
ish of synthetic horn-music, the walls 
of the kennel dissolved and I beheld 
the boundless, glowing landscape of 
the asteroids. 

I gasped. 

It is yours , said a voice in my 
head that would soon come to 
seem as familar as my own. 

Hand in hand, Julie and I sailed 
out over this phantasmagorical play- 
ground, and the spheres of heaven 
played their music for us. Exotic 
blossoms fexploded, like Roman 
candles, discharging their hoards of 
rich perfume. Colors wreathed us 
in abstract, joyous patterns, as the 
two of us bounded and tumbled 
through the shifting fields of gravi- 
ty, like starlings caught in a dynamo. 

Can it be that I shall never again 
enjoy the easy pleasures of that time? 
When I remember the way I passed 
through those ten beautiful years, 



I wonder if I am truly free or if I 
may not be, instead, exiled. Nothing, 
nothing on Earth can compare with 
the infinite resources of the Masters’ 
pleasure domes. 

It was paradise. 

Really, it was almost paradise. 
Illness and pain were banished from 
our lives, and it might have been 
(for I know of no instance to dis- 
prove it) that, so long as we stayed 
Leashed, death too had lost its sting. 
Women no longer brought forth chil- 
dren in sorrow, nor did men eat 
their bread in the sweat of their 
brows. Our happiness did not de- 
generate into boredom, and our 
pleasures were never dampened by 
an aftertaste of guilt. 

Paradise has a considerable flaw, 
however, from the narrative point of 
view. It is anti-dramatic. Perfection 
doesn’t make a good yarn, unless one 
attempts (as I am given to under- 
stand my brother Pluto has at- 
tempted, in his more abstruse works) 
to emulate Dante. So there isn’t 
much for me to tell you, except: 
/ liked it, 

I liked it; for ten years that was 
the story of my life. 

in 

I n the summer of 2037, ten years 
after our departure, the three of 
us — Julie, myself, and our Master 
— were back again on Earth. Julie, 
in one of her sentimental moods, 
had wanted to stop by first at the 
Nelson farm, where we had met. Our 
Master, as usual, indulged her whim. 

We sat, in the lightest of Leash- 
es, beneath our apple tree and mar-

veiled at the changes time had 
wrought not only in ourselves (for 
we had, after all, passed from puppy- 
hood to maturity in the meantime) 
but also in the scene about us. 

The roof of the barn had fallen 
in, and in the orchard and surround- 
ing meadows, saplings had taken 
root and were flourishing. Julie glor- 
ied in the Gothic Revival. So great 
was her passion for returning to 
the past that she begged our Master 
to be Unleashed! 

“Please,” she whined. “Just this 
once. I feel so anachronistic out here 
in a Leash,” 

Our Master pretended not to hear. 

“Pretty please,” she whined more 
loudly, though it was much more 
like a bark by now. 

A voice in my head (and in Julie’s 
too, of course) soothed: There , now , 
gently. What's this , my darlings, my 
dears , my very own pets? Why 
should you wish to throw off your 
Leashes? Why — you're hardly 
Leashed at all! Do you want to turn 
into Dingoes? 

“Yes!” Julie replied. “Just for this 
afternoon I want to be a Dingo.” 

I was shocked. Yet I must admit 
that at the same time I was a little 
excited. It had been so long since 
I had been without a Leash, that 
so primitive an idea appealed to 
me. I felt a yen for novelty. Or, as 
the Dingoes would say, freedom is a 
natural instinct of man. 

If l Unleash you, there's no way 
for you to call me back. You'll just 
have to wait till I come back for 
you. 

“That’s all right,” Julie assured 
him. “We won’t leave the farm.” 



I'll return in the morning, little 
ones. Wait for me. 

“Oh we will, we will,” Julie and I 
promised antiphonally. 

And then he was gone, and our 
minds stood naked in an alien world. 
A more vivid pink flushed Julie’s 
cheek, and her eyes sparkled with 
a sudden, unaccustomed brilliance. 
I realized that this was probably 
the first time in her life as a pet — 
in her whole life, that is — that she 
has been entirely Unleashed. She 
was probably feeling ‘tipsy. I was. 

“Hello, Earthling,” she said. Her 
voice seemed different, sharper and 
quicker. She plucked an apple from 
the branches overhead and polished 
it on her velvety skin. 

“You shouldn’t eat that, you 
know,” I said. 

“I know.” She bit into it, then, 
with a little giggle, offered the rest 
of the apple to me. It was rather 
an obvious literary reference, but 
I could see no reason to refuse the 
apple. 

I took a large bite out of it. When 
I saw the other half of the worm 
that remained in the apple, I began 
to retch, bringing our little morality 
play to an abrupt conclusion. 

It was Julie who found the pump 
and got it working. The well water 
had a distinctly rusty flavor, but it 
was at least preferable to the taste 
in my mouth. Then, with my head 
in Julie’s lap and her fingers tousling 
my hair, I went to sleep, though it 
was the middle of the day. 

W hen I woke, the heat of the 
afternoon sun was touching 
me at every pore and I was damp

IF 




with sweat. The wind made an ir- 
regular sound in the trees around 
us, and from the branches overhead, 
a crow cried hoarsely and took to 
the air. I watched its clumsy trajec- 
tory with an amusement somehow 
tinged with uneasiness. This is what 
it was like to be mortal. 

“We’re getting sunburnt,” Julie 
observed placidly. “I think we should 
go into the house.” 

“That would be trespassing,” I 
pointed out. 

“So much the better,” said Julie, 
for whom the romance of being a 
Dingo for a day had not yet worn 
off. 

In the farmhouse, dusty strands 
of adhesive — cobwebs — hung 
from the ceiling, and the creaking 
floor was littered with paper that 
time had peeled from the walls. In 
the upstairs rooms, Julie found 
closets and drawers of mildewed 
clothing, including some cotton 
dresses that would have been the 
right size for a ten year old. It 
was hard to think of Roxanna ever 
being that small. I felt vaguely guil- 
ty to have opened up this window 
on the past, and, when one of the 
dresses, rotten with age, came apart 
in my hands, a little spooky too. I 
took Julie into another of the up- 
stairs rooms, which contained a 
broad cushioned apparatus, raised 
about a yard off the floor. The 
cushion smelled awfully. 

“It’s a bed!” Julie said. “I’ve read 
about beds.” 

“So have I,” I replied. “In 
Shakespeare. But these beds smell.” 

“They must decay, like the cloth- 
ing” 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 




I sat down on the edge of the 
bed, and it bounced with a creak- 
ing, metallic sound, like the sound 
of the pump outside. Julie laughed 
and jumped onto the bed beside me. 
It groaned, and the groan deepened 
to a rasp, and the rasp snapped. 
Julie went right on laughing as the 
bed collapsed to the floor. Looking 
at her sprawled out beside me on 
that quaint apparatus, I became 
aware of a feeling that I had never 
experienced before. For, though I 
had often made love to Julie, I had 
never felt quite this urgent about 
it. Undoubtedly, this was a result 
of being Unleashed. 

“Julie,” I said, “I’m going to bite 
you.” 

“Grr,” she growled playfully. 

“Arf,” I replied. 

W e spent the night in the farm- 
house amid creakings and 
groanings of old wood and ominous 
scurryings in the walls. We were up 
with the sun and we went, shivering, 
directly out of doors to wait be- 
neath the apple tree. We were cold 
and we were hungry, and swarms of 
hostile, buzzing insects rose from the 
dew-drenched grass to settle on our 
raw skins and feed on our blood. 1 
killed three or four, but the sense- 
less things continued to attack us, 
quite oblivious to their danger. I 
began to understand why humans 
had always worn clothes before the 
advent of the Masters. 

The sun had risen nearly to noon- 
day, when Julie finally turned to 
me and asked: “What do you sup- 
pose is wrong, Cuddles?” 

It was useless by now to pretend 



that nothing was wrong, but I could 
only answer her question with a 
look of dismay. Perhaps we were 
being punished for asking to be Un- 
leashed. Perhaps — 

But how could we presume to in- 
terpret the Masters actions, especi- 
ally such irresponsible, inconceiv- 
able, and thoughtless actions as leav- 
ing two pedigreed pets defenseless in 
an alien world among dingoes! 

When our hunger grew extreme, 
we gorged on apples, cherries, and 
sour plums, not even bothering to 
look for wormholes. Through that 
afternoon and into the night, we 
waited, but at last the chill and dark- 
ness of the night forced us into the 
house. 

The next morning was spent in 
more useless waiting, though this 
time we had the prudence to wear 
clothing — pants and jackets of 
rough blue cloth and rubberized 
boots. Almost everything else had 
rotted beyond repair. Our Master 
did not return. 

“Julie,” I said at last, “we’re on 
our own. Our Master has abandoned 
us.” She began to cry, not making 
much noise about it, but the tears 
rolled down her cheeks in a steady 
stream faster than I could kiss them 
away. 

But for all that, I must confess 
that Julie adapted to our new con- 
dition more readily than I. She en- 
joyed the challenges of that archaic 
and almost Dingo-like existence. 
Every day while I went to a high 
hill in the vicinity to call, hopeless- 
ly and to no effect, to our Master, 
to any Master, Julie busied herself 
about the old house, clearing the 



100 



IF 




floors, dusting, washing, airing out 
the musty furniture and decaying 
mattresses, and experimenting with 
the interesting new vegetables that 
grew among the weeds of a forgotten 
garden. My visits to the hillside be- 
came less frequent after the first 
week. I was convinced that our 
Master would never return to us. 
The thought of his cruelty and in- 
difference passed quite beyond be- 
lief. 

Helping Julie at odd jobs around 
the farm, I began to have a certain 
respect for the pre-Mastery technol- 
ogy of Earth. I discovered and re- 
paired one mechanical device that 
was especially useful: a rough stone 
wheel three feet in diameter and 
three inches thick that was set into 
rotary motion by a foot pedal. By 
holding a piece of metal to the re- 
volving wheel, the machine could be 
made to give off sparks, and these 
in turn ignited dry scraps of wood. 
The fire thus produced could be 
conserved in various engines in the 
farmhouse. Fire had an immense 
utility, but since I assume my read- 
ers are familiar with it, I will not 
make my digression any longer. 

I only mention in passing that 
on the night of my discovery, Julie, 
sitting by me in front of a roaring 
log fire, looked at me with real 
admirationl A look that I returned 
— for she was very lovely in the 
firelight, lovelier than she had even 
been before, it seemed. The firelight 
softened the contours of her face, 
until I was aware only of her re- 
laxed, easy smile and the brightness 
of her eyes, a brightness that did not 
need to borrow its brilliance from 



the fire but seemed to issue from 
her very being. 

“Prometheus,” she whispered. 

“My own Pandora,” I returned, 
and a scrap of old verse popped 
into my mind, at once comforting 
and terrible in its implications. I re- 
cited it to Julie in a low voice: 

Your courteous lights in vain 
you waste , 

Since Juliana here is come; 

For she my mind has so dis- 
placed , 

That l shall never find my 
home. 

Julie shivered theatrically. “Cud- 
dles,” she said, “we’ve got to find 
our way home.” 

“Don’t call me Cuddles,” I said 
in, for me, a rough manner. “If you 
won’t call me White Fang, stick to 
Prometheus.” 

IV 

D ay followed day with no sign 
of our Master’s return. The 
longer we stayed at the farm, the 
more inevitable discovery became. 
On my trips to the hillside I had 
sometimes noticed clouds of dust 
rising from the country roads, and 
though I was careful to keep un- 
der cover, I knew that luck alone 
and merely luck had prevented our 
capture so far. My imagination re- 
coiled from what would become of 
us if we were to fall into the hands 
of Dingoes. I remembered my father, 
and it was not a memory to inspire 
confidence. 

Therefore I determined that Julie 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 



101 




and I must find our way to the 
Schroeder Kennel on foot, where, 
though we might not be so happy 
as we had been in the asteroids, we 
would at least be secure. But I had 
bo idea of how to get there. Years 
ago when Roxanna had driven us to 
the farmhouse, she had taken a cir- 
cuitous route, in a vaguely south- 
western direction, which I had never 
troubled to learn. In any case, it was 
BOt wise to walk along the roads. 

I renewed my treks through the 
nearby woods, searching for a sign- 
post, something to guide us back to 
civilization. At last a sign was given 
to me: a hill rose on the other side 
•f a marsh, on the crest of that 
hill was an electric powerline! 

Where there was electricity there 
would be Masters. 

In 1970 when the Masters had 
first manifested themselves to man- 
kind, they had insisted that they be 
given complete authority over all 
electric plants, dams, dynamos, and 
radio stations. Without in any way 
interfering with their utility from 
a human standpoint (indeed, they 
effected major improvements). The 
Masters transformed this pre-exis- 
tent network into a sort of electro- 
magnetic pleasure spa. 

In time, of course, their additions 
and refinements exceeded mere hu- 
man need or comprehension. Human 
labor could manufacture devices ac- 
cording to the Masters’ specifica- 
tions that human understanding 
would never be able to fathom. But 
even human labor became obsolete 
as the Masters — in themselves, a 
virtually unlimited power supply — 
atayed on and took things over. 



freeing man from the drudgery of 
the commonplace that has been his 
perennial complaint. Freeing, to be 
more exact, everyone who agreed to 
become a pet. 

Although in many respects, the 
Masters’ innovations had superced- 
ed the primitive technology of the 
1970’s, they still maintained, large- 
ly for the benefit of the Dingoes, a 
modified system of electric power- 
lines, lacing the entire world in ar- 
cane geometrical patterns that only 
the Masters could understand. 

It was to the power lines that the 
Masters came to bathe and exercise, 
and so it was to the power lines 
that Julie and I must go. Even if 
there was no way to reach the Mas- 
ters as they flocked back and forth 
in the wires overhead, we could 
follow the lines to some generator 
or powerhouse, perhaps the one that 
adjoined the Schroeder Kennel, per- 
haps one elsewhere, for kennels 
were invariably located near power 
stations. 

And, once we reached the power- 
line, it would be a safe journey. No 
Dingo would dare trespass into the 
very heart of the Masters’ domain. 

We prepared for the trip in min- 
utes. While Julie improvised knap- 
sacks, I went to the toolshed. There 
was an antique weapon there, a rusty 
wedge of iron mounted on a long 
wooden handle. I tested it out on the 
floor of the shed and with a little 
practice T could swing it with lethal 
force and fair accuracy. If it splin- 
tered Dingoes half so well as it 
smashed pine boards, it would serve 
my purpose admirably. Grimly, I 
refined upon its murderous proper-

ties. I had noticed that the spark- 
producing machine would put a fine 
edge on metal that was held against 
it at the proper angle. After patient 
experimentation, I had so sharpened 
the iron blade that the merest touch 
would sliver flesh. Now, I thought, 
let the Dingoes come! 

We set off before noon, neither 
of us in the best of spirits: Julie was 
wistful and melancholic at leaving 
the farm (though she agreed we had 
no other choice), and I was nervous 
and apprehensive. From the hill 
from which I had espied the power- 
line, we struck out into a wood of 
scrub pine, birch, and balsam. In 
the woods, there was no way to 
estimate our progress. The sun can 
be used as a compass, but it makes 
a poor speedometer. We walked, 
and when it seemed that we had 
walked twice, three times the dis- 
tance to the power line, we kept on 
walking. Julie became petulant; I be- 
came angry. Then she grew angry 
and I sulked. But always while we 
were walking. The brush caught at 
our pant legs, and the mosquitos 
nipped at our necks. The mud at 
the edge of marsh about which we 
were forced to detour sucked at our 
boots. And we walked. 

T he sun, striated by long, low, 
wispy clouds hung huge and 
crimson at the horizon behind us; be- 
fore us a pale sliver of moon peeped 
over the crest of a hill — and on the 
hill, black against the indigo of the 
sky, stood the powerline. 

Julie dropped her pack and ran 
up the hill. “Masters,” she cried, 
“Masters, we’ve come. Leash us. 



Make us yours again. Bring us 
home.” 

The powerline stood stark and 
immobile, wires swaying gently in 
the breeze. Julie embraced the 
wooden pole and screamed at the 
unhearing wires: “Master, your pets 
have come back to you. Why did 
you leave us But we’ve come back. 
We forgive you. We love you. 
MASTERS!” 

“They don’t hear you,” I said 
softly. 

Julie stood up, squaring her shoul- 
ders bravely, and joined me where 
I had remained at the foot of the 
hill. There were no tears in her eyes. 
But her lips were pressed together 
in a mirthless, unbecoming smile. 

“I hate them,” she pronounced in 
a clear voice. “With my whole being, 
I hate them!” Then she fell into my 
arms in a dead faint. 

As twilight deepened to night, I 
stood guard over Julie and watched 
with amazement and renewed hope 
the great shafts of light that streamed 
from the northern horizon. They 
glowed whitely in the black sky, 
dimming the stars as they shot out, 
dissolved, and re-formed. 

The Northern Lights. Aurora Bo- 
realis. 

It was there especially that the 
Masters loved to play and relax. 
They felt at home among the elec- 
trons of the Van Allen Belt and 
where it curved in to touch the 
Earth’s atmosphere at the magnetic 
poles, they followed it, controlling 
the ionization of the air, structuring 
those pillars of light that men 
have always wondered at to con- 
form to the elaborate rules of their

supravisual geometry. These shift- 
ing patterns were the supreme de- 
light of the Masters, and it was pre- 
cisely because of the strength of 
Earth’s Van Allen Belt that they 
had originally been drawn to this 
planet. They had only bothered to 
concern themselves with mankind 
after a number of nuclear explosions 
had been set off in the Van Allen 
Belt in the 1960’s. 

The aurora that night was incred- 
ibly beautiful, and so I knew that 
the Masters were still on Earth, liv- 
ing and flaming for their pets — their 
poor, lost, maltreated pets — to see. 

It was a cold flame, and very re- 
mote. 

“Your courteous lights in vain 
you waste,” I muttered. 

Julie, who has always been a light 
sleeper, stirred. “I’m sorry,” she 
mumbled, probably too sleepy still 
to remember what she was supposed 
to be sorry about. 

“It’s all right. We can find them 
tomorrow,” I said, “and tomorrow 
and tomorrow.” Julie smiled and 
slid by imperceptible degrees back 
into sleep. 



farmhouses set back from the road 
and, twice, the road widened and the 
ruins of houses were set closer to- 
gether: a town. Here the poles 

would branch off in all directions, 
but the main powerline followed its 
single course toward Schroeder. The 
poles were of rough pine, stained to 
a reddish-brown by creosote, one 
just like another, until — 

Julie noticed it as we neared 
Schroeder. Running up and down 
the poles were thin silvery lines that 
glinted metalically in the sunlight. 
On closer inspection, the lines 
formed vertical chains of decorative 
elements in simple repeating pat- 
terns. One common design of over- 
lapping circles linked in series by 
straight lines, so: 




Another was a simple zigzag pat- 
tern: 

— vVV — 

The most frequent designed re- 
sembled a circuiting diagram of dry 
cells in series: 



T he next day we followed the 
lines to the north. They ran 
along an old asphalt road, scarred 
with fissures and upheavals, but still 
easier to travel than the rank brush 
on either side. 

A faded 1 sign gave the distance to 
Schroeder as 22 miles. Using the 
road (for the wires overhead were 
sufficient protection, as we thought, 
against the Dingoes), we could hope 
to reach the kennel by midafter- 
noon. Regularly we passed deserted 



— I 1 — I 



In fact, they were all circuiting 
diagrams! 

It was too crude decoratively 
and such nonsense from any other 
point of view that I knew it could 
not be the work of the Masters. 
No, there was something barbaric 
about these markings that suggest- 
ed Dingoes. 

But what Dingo would dare ap- 
proach this near the sanctuary of 



104 



IF 




the Masters? The Kennel must be 
only a few hundred yards off. I 
began to have misgivings about our 
security. Before I could properly 
begin to savor this danger, another 
had presented itself. 

“Cuddles!” Julie screamed. “My 
God, the power station!” 

I was already at her side. A cy- 
clone fence that ran some hundred 
fc; t along the road prevented our 
entrance to the substation, but it 
made no difference, for it was noth- 
ing but a rubble heap now. I-beams, 
gnarled and twisted like the limbs of 
denuded oaks, stood in black sil- 
houette against the light blue of the 
afternoon sky. The pylons that had 
fed the high tension wires into the 
substation lay on the ground like 
metal Goliaths, quite dead. The 
wires that had led out from the sta- 
tion had been snapped and hung 
inert from the top of the cyclone 
fence, where now and again a breeze 
would stir them. 

“It’s been bombed,” I said, “and 
that’s impossible.” 

“Dingoes?” 

“Yes, I suppose so. But how 
could they?” 

It made no sense. So primitive an 
attack <§s this couldn’t succeed 
against the Masters when the whole 
rich arsenal of 20th Century science 
had failed. Oh, the nuclear blasts in 
the Van Allen Belt had annoyed 
them. But I doubted then and I 
doubt now whether man has it in 
>his power actually to kill one of 
the Masters. 

How could it be done? How do 
you fight something without dimen- 
sions, without even known equations 



that might give a symbolic approx- 
imation to its character? Not, surely, 
by bombing minor power stations 
here and there. Not even by bomb- 
ing them all. The Masters transcend- 
ed mere technology. 

Inside the fence, from somewhere 
in the tangle of gutted machinery, 
there was a moan. A woman’s voice 
reiterated the single word: “Mas- 
ters, Masters ...” 

“That’s not a Dingo,” Julie said. 
“Some poor pet has been caught in 
there. Why, Cuddles, do you real- 
ize this means all the pets have been 
abandoned?” 

We made our way through a hole 
in the fence sheared open by a 
fallen pylon. Kneeling a few feet 
from that hole, her face turned 
away from us, was the moaning 
woman. She was using the blasted 
crossbeam of the pylon as a sort of 
prie-dieu. Her hair, though tangled 
and dirty, still showed traces of 
domestication. She was decently 
naked, but her flesh was discolored 
by bruises and her legs were badly 
scratched. Confronted with this 
pathetic ruin of a once handsome 
pet, I realized for the first time 
how terribly wild Julie looked: 
dressed in the most vulgar clothes, 
her hair wound up in a practical 
but inartistic bun and knotted with 
strips of cloth, her lovely feet en- 
cased in clumsy rubber boots. We 
must have looked like Dingoes. 

The poor woman stopped moan- 
ing and turned to confront us. Her 
face expressed, in order, the ascend- 
ing degrees of amazement, ending 
in blank amaze. 

“Father,” she said, aghast. 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 



105 




“Roxanna!” I exclaimed. “Is it 
you?” 

V 

I t was she. We were the longest 
time calming her and explaining 
that, quite the opposite to being her 
father, I was only little White Fang, 
grown up to a man’s estate. 

“But your clothes,” she said. “I’d 
know that jacket anywhere. And 
those boots with the red rubber 
circle around the rim.” 

Briefly as I could I explained how 
our Master had brought us to the 
farm and deserted us, and how we 
had to take clothes from the farm- 
house — her parents’ clothes, as it 
happened. 

“And did your brother Pluto come 
back with you?” 

“No. He’s left the solar system, 
the last I heard.” 

Roxanna’s expression underwent 
a subtle change, as though she had 
begun to make calculations. The 
conversation lapsed awkwardly. 

“Have you read Pluto’s book?” 
Julie asked. 

“I started it, but I couldn’t un- 
derstand it.” She sighed. “My read- 
ing’s fallen off lately. Even Proust 
doesn’t seem as interesting as he 
used to. And then, of course, there’s 
been this revolution ...” 

“Ah yes,” I said, “the revolution. 
Would you tell us some more about 
that?” 

Roxanna’s account was none too 
clear, having been assembled from 
eavesdropped conversations and un- 
informed conjecture. Even the word 
revolution proved to be misleading. 



I’ve written here not the garbled 
story Roxanna told us then, but the 
facts as they were later to be estab- 
lished by the courts and newspapers. 

July had been a month of un- 
usual sunspot activity. The Masters, 
anticipating the dynamic auroral 
displays that follow such periods, 
had flocked to Earth — many, like 
our Master, bringing their pets with 
them. Shortly after our arrival, dur- 
ing the afternoon that Julie and I 
had been Unleashed, a solar promin- 
ence of extraordinary intensity had 
erupted from the center of a sun- 
spot cluster and knocked the Mas- 
ters out of commission. 

It was like a house that’s been 
drawing too heavily on its current. 
Everything was turned on: the re- 
frigerator, the stove, the air condi- 
tioner, the iron, the toaster, the 
coffee pot, the flood lights, the tele- 
vision, and the model railroad in the 
basement. Then Blat!, lightning 
strikes and there’s one hell of a 
short circuit. Lights out, tubes 
popped, wires burnt, motors dead. 

The Masters weren’t dead, of 
course. They’re made of stronger 
stuff than toasters. But while they 
convalesced . 

Roxanna herself had been spared 
the worst of it, since she hadn’t 
been in the Shroeder Kennel when 
the lights went out. But she’d seen 
it happen. In a flash (literally, a 
flash), the entire kennel — walls, 
floors, even the anti-gravitic furni- 
ture had disappeared. 

It was as though they had existed 
only as an idea in the mind of God, 
and then God had gone and forgot- 
ten them. Pets, who had been soar- 



106 



W 




j ing balletically in the veet ipaees of 
tiie gymnasium, soared now in vaster 
spaces. Everyone who had been in 
the Kennel suddenly found himself 
plunging down to the ground, over- 
powered by the Earth’s gravity, ac- 
celerating. 

The carnage had been terrible. 
The Schroeder Kennel, such as it 
was, was thrown into panic. But the 
worst was still before them. The 
Dingoes, quicker to realize what had 
happened than the distracted pets, 
had overrun the breeding farms and 
kennels everywhere. In the first 
fires of revolutionary excitement, 
they were ruthless. Puppies were 
taken from their mothers, to be 
raised in the homes of Dingoes; 
the men, any who resisted, were 
r.uthlessly slaughtered before the 
eyes of their mates, and the women 
. Well, what would one expect of 
Dingoes? 

A t this point Roxanna broke into 
tears, unable to go on. I noticed 
then that her body was covered with 
small black-and-blue marks, too tiny 
to have resulted from blows, but too 
numerous to be accidental. I insisted 
that Roxanna finish her tale. 

“Oh, I hate him!” she said, not 
loudly but quite expressively none- 
theless. “I hate him! God, how I 
hate him!” 

All in all, it took Roxanna the 
better part of two hours to tell this 
story, for she had a way of veering 
off into digressions that would have 
been the delight of. any admirer of 
Tristram Shandy , though, for my 
own part, I am inclined to be more 
straightforward. In fact, her divaga- 



tions had begun to distress me con- 
siderably, as soon as I realized that 
the vicinity was still swarming with 
Dingoes, and that Roxanna was liv- 
ing with the chief of them! 

“Roxanna,” I said, trying to get 
her to her feet, “Julie and I are go- 
ing to help you to escape. And we’d 
better start right away.” 

“It’s too late,” Roxanna said with 
a sigh in which the resignation was 
not unmixed with a little pleasure. 
Too long allegiance to such a master 
as Proust had finally taken its toll 
on Roxanna’s character, and, though 
I may anticipate my story by men- 
tioning the word here, I should like 
to say it and have done. Roxanna, 
sadly, was something of a maso- 
chist. 

“Roxanna,” I said, more firmly 
now, “you must come with us.” 

“Get your own bitch, Master,” 
came a good-natured bellow of a 
voice from not too far away. With a 
sinking heart, I faced the intruder, 
a red-faced hulk of flesh many sizes 
too large for the khakis he wore. 
He stood on the other side of the 
fence, arms akimbo and grinning 
broadly. He held what looked like 
a glass fishing rod in his meaty hand. 
“The name’s Schwartz — Bruno 
Schwartz. I’m the head of the RIC 
in these parts. We’re repatriating 
these damn pets. Now, come on 
home, Rocky, old girl. Your master 
calls.” He laughed. 

So this was a Dingo! For the mo- 
ment I was safe, for he obviously 
mistook me for a Dingo too, and 
perhaps I might have escaped if I 
had let him go on believing it. But 
I was too angry.

‘‘You are not Roxanna’s Master, 
and she is not going with you.” 

“The hell you say!” 

“Please,” Roxanna pleaded. “I 
must go to him.” But her body 
didn’t protest; she was limp with 
fear. I pushed her behind me and 
picked up my axe from the ground. 

Bruno’s smile broadened. “What 
are you, anyhow? Some kind of 
pet!” 

“Dingo!” I said with the utmost 
contempt. 

Bruno reached a hand behind his 
back and made adjustments on an 
apparatus strapped there. It was the 
size of one of our knapsacks. Then 
he climbed through the hole in the 
fence, brandishing the long, flexible 
pole. 

“Axes!” he scoffed. “Next thing 
you know someone will invent the 
bow and arrow.” 

I advanced toward the Dingo, who 
stood now within the fence, my axe 
readied and murder in my heart, 
as they say. With my left hand I 
held to the metal frame of the fallen 
pylon, using it as a crutch. My knees 
were very weak. 

Bruno flicked the end of the glass 
fishing rod against the pylon. There 
was a spark and my mind reeled. 

I was sitting on the ground. I could 
see Bruno above me between 
white flashes of unconsciousness. I 
swung at him wildly. The axe hit 
the pylon with a dull thunk. 

He flicked the pole at me again. 
It touched my left leg at the knee. 
The shock tore through my body 
and wrenched a cry from my lips. 
“Good stuff, huh, Jack? Great 



IF 




for the circulation. If you’re inter- 
ested in mechanical things, it’s real 
easy to make. It’s a prod pole. Prod 
poles were meant for cattle, but they 
work on most any animal.” 

He flicked it again, tracing a line 
of pain across my neck. I screamed 
in agony — I couldn’t help it. 

“The fishpole was my idea. It 
handles easier this way.” 

He let the tip of the pole play 
over my right arm. Every shred of 
consciousness that remained to me 
was in my hand. I clenched the axe 
handle until the pain in my hand 
was worse than the flashes of pain 
that tore through my whole body — 
until there was no consciousness 
left. 

When I woke (seconds later? Min- 
utes? I don’t know), I could hear 
Roxanna’s hysterical laughter. Bruno 
had finished with her. Julie’s voice, 
pitched so high that I could hardly 
recognize it, was saying stay away , 
and then, a little sharper still, Stay 
away! 

There was a sparking noise and 
her scream. “White Fang!” she 
called. “Oh, Mastery — White Fang!” 

She had called me that! Not Cud- 
dles, not Prometheus. White Fang! 
I sprang to my feet, and the axe was 
just part of my hand now. I felt, 
as never before, even when I was 
Leashed, totally alive and aware, ab- 
solutely sure of myself. My body was 
a living flame. 

Bruno had caught hold of Julie. 
He heard me scrambling over the 
wreckage of the station and turned 
around just in time for the axe to 
come crashing down across his chest. 

I hadn’t meant to draw blood. I 



had only wanted to smash the power 
pack strapped to his back. 

There was a terrible gush of blood 
from the chest wound, thick and 
winy. The axe in my hand was cov- 
ered with blood. It was horrible. I 
had never seen anyone bleeding like 
this before, never. 

It was horrible! The blood. The 
thought that I had done this — even 
the sight of it — was too much, and 
I collapsed onto Bruno’s fallen 
body. 

The last thing I remember was 
Roxanna’s tear-streaked face as she 
rushed forward to take the fallen 
Dingo in her arms. 

VI 

T hough my bed was comfortable, 
the walls of the room antisep- 
tically white, and my meals thor- 
oughly good, I suspect that I spent 
the next week in a prison, not a 
hospital. The guard who brought 
my food would not speak to me, and 
I was not allowed to read. My only 
diversion from anxiously wondering 
what was in store for me was look- 
ing down at the semi-deserted streets 
four stories below. 

I did not know what city this was 
nor how I had come here. There 
was some faint recollection of sit- 
ting by another, smaller window and 
staring with dismay at the labor- 
ing propeller without, desperately 
wishing my Master had been there 
to tend to its rustic operation — but 
perhaps that was only one of the 
nightmares I had so frequently then. 

I knew that the few people I saw 
on the streets, the women in long.

ungainly dresses and the men in un- 
seasonably heavy suits, must be Din- 
goes. And though I had never seen 
Dingoes in such close proximity be- 
fore, their dress and behavior was so 
uniformly dull that I soon grew tired 
of observing them and began, in- 
stead, to count the cars that went 
by. 

This wasn’t so boring as you might 
think, for the various trucks, jeeps, 
and tractors still in use among the 
Dingoes (rarely if ever did one see 
a car) presented a beautiful study 
in comparative ruination. From the 
way they roared and sputtered and 
spewed out black clouds of noxious 
gas it was obvious that the Dingoes 
had abandoned heavy industry for 
decades. These were antiques. 

They were usually of an official 
nature, and those same insignia 
which I had seen scrawled on the 
telephone poles outside of Schroeder 
"were painted on the sides of the 
trucks or on banners that streamed 
from the jeeps’ antennae. I was re- 
minded of the heraldic devices of 
some crusading army: Resistor 

statant, sable on a field of gules; 
diode dormant, on a quartered field, 
ermine and vert. 

To my surprise, the city was 
strongly illuminated at night. Either 
the Dingoes had an independent 
source of electrical power (which 
seemed unlikely) or the Masters had 
the power stations back in oper- 
ation and were reestablishing their 
dominance. For a moment the 
chemistry of hope jangled my nerve 
ends, but I quickly recollected where 
exactly T was, and the hope fizzled. 

After a week in this limbo, I re- 



ceived my first visitor. It was Julie, 
but a Julie so altered in appearance 
that I thought at first she was a 
Dingo spy in disguise. Prison does 
develop one’s paranoid tendencies. 

She was wearing a high-necked, 
long-sleeved, floor length dress in 
the Dingo style and her beautiful 
hair was concealed by an ungainly 
cork helmet such as I had seen on 
several persons passing below my 
window. 

“Julie!” I exclaimed. “What have 
they done to you?” 

“I’ve been repatriated.” She wasn’t 
able to raise her eyes to look into 
mine, and her whole manner was 
one of unnatural constraint. No 
doubt, this could be accounted for 
by the presence of the armed guard 
who was watching us from the open 
doorway. 

“You mean they’ve forced you 
to — ” 

“Nobody’s forced me to do any- 
thing. I just decided to become a 
Dingo. They’re really much nicer 
than I thought they’d be. They’re not 
all like Bruno. And even he’s not so 
bad — once you get to know him.” 
“My God, Julie!” 

“Oh, don’t be upset. That’s not 
what I meant. Bruno’s too much in 
love with Roxanna to think of 
bothering me.” 

“That isn’t what I meant.” 

B ut Julie went blithely on. 

“They’re going to get married 
as soon as she’s out of the hospital. 
On the airplane coming here, he was 
delirious and he told me all about 
himself. I can’t say I understood 
much of it. Do you know that he 



no 



IF 




actually likes you? He does. There 
he was all bandaged up, lying on the 
stretcher, and he said, ‘I wasn’t 
smashed like that since God knows 
when. Good man! We’ll get along, 
White Fang and me.’ I thought it 
was just the delirium, but he was 
serious. He wants you to visit the 
both of them as soon as you can.” 

‘‘And Roxanna’s going to marry 
him?” 

“Yes. And she’s very mad at you. 
For hurting Bruno.” 

“But T was trying to protect her!” 

The story that Julie at last un- 
folded, in her rather scattered way 
was this: Roxanna, when she saw 
me strike Bruno with the axe, sud- 
denly decided that she was in love 
with her tormentor, and her new- 
found love was every bit as strong 
as the hatred she had expressed only 
minutes before. In the heat of the 
moment, she had been almost angry 
enough to use my axe on me, but 
Julie and the Dingoes who had been 
drawn to the scene had been able to 
stop her. They didn’t stop her from 
revealing that I was the son of 
Tennyson White, a fact that Roxanna 
was sure would lead to my summary 
execution, since she had often heard 
the story of how Daddy had been 
done in by the Dingoes. But instead 
we’d been shipped off to St. Paul, 
where the Dingoes had their head- 
quarters in the old State Capitol 
Building. 

What they intended to do with me 
now, Julie would not say, even if she 
knew. I had my own grim suspi- 
cions. 

Julie spent the rest of her visit 
trying to justify the haste with which 



she had allowed the Dingoes to re- 
patriate her, and since she had no 
apparent excuse but expediency, it 
was rather hard going. 

At last I interrupted her: “Julie, 
please don’t talk on about it. I quite 
understand that you’ve had to dis- 
associate yourself from me. Heaven 
only knows what they intend should 
happen to me, but there’s no reason 
it should happen to you as well. Per- 
haps they mean to use me as a hos- 
tage. Perhaps they mean something 
worse. In either case, you’re lucky 
to be rid of me.” I was just begin- 
ning to hit my stride, and no doubt 
I would have brought myself to the 
point of tears, when Julie started to 
giggle. 

To giggle! She tittered and snorted 
and snuffled like someone who can’t 
keep a joke, and she left the room 
bent double with the pain of holding 
back her laughter. 

Hysteria, of course. It was a very 
sad thing to see the girl you love in 
such a condition and to be unable 
to help. 

W ithin an hour of Julie’s de- 
parture, I was removed from 
my cell and conducted to an un- 
marked limousine in perfect working 
condition. 

I did not know where it was tak- 
ing me, for the curtains were drawn 
in the back seat, but shortly we 
found ourselves in a large and large- 
ly vacant underground parking area. 
Then, after a labyrinth of staircases, 
corridors, guards, and passwords, I 
at last found myself alone in front 
of an imposing mahogany desk. 

The desk and all the appointments

of this room testified to the conse- 
quence of their possessor. In a sub- 
sistence economy like that of the 
Dingoes, luxury is a potent symbol. 

My attention was especially drawn 
to the portrait that hung over the 
desk. Done in the mock-primitive 
style popular in the late sixties of the 
last century, it slyly exaggerated 
those features of the subject which 
were most suggestive of the raw and 
barbarous. His stomach, though 
monumental itself, was seen from a 
perspective that magnified its bulk. 
The face was crudely colored, par- 
ticularly the nose, which was a 
florid, alcoholic crimson. The violet- 
tinged lips were at once cynical and 
voluptuary. The picture was the per- 
fect archetype of the Dingo. 

Yet, perhaps not perfect, for the 
eyes shone with an intelligence and 
good will that seemed to contradict 
the overall impression of brutish- 
ness. This one dissonance added to 
the archetype that touch of individ- 
ual life which only the best portrait- 
ists have ever been able to achieve. 

I was still engaged in studying this 
painting (and really, it had the 
strangest fascination for me) when its 
original stepped into the room and 
came forward to shake my hand. 

“Sorry to have kept you waiting, 
but my time hasn’t been my own 
ever since that damn sunspot.” 

When he had finished shaking my 
hand, he did not immediately re- 
lease it, but, keeping it in his, looked 
me over appraisingly. “You’ll have 
to get rid of that name of yours, you 
know. White Fang just won’t do. We 
Dingoes as you call us, don’t like 
doggish names. Your proper name 



is Dennis White, isn't it? Well, Den- 
nis, welcome to the revolution.” 
“Thank you but . 

“But who am I? I’m the Grand 
High Diode. As far as you’re con- 
cerned, that means vice-president. 
Are you interested in politics?” 
“Pets don’t have to be. We’re 
free.” 

“Ah, freedom!” The Grand High 
Diode made an expansive gesture, 
then plopped into the seat behind 
the desk. “Your Master takes care 
of everything for you and leaves you 
so perfectly free. Except that you 
can’t taste anything from the good- 
and-evil tree, why, there’s nothing 
that isn’t allowed you.” 

He glowered at me dramatically, 
and I had time to compare the por- 
trait with the portrayed. My admir- 
ation for the artist grew by leaps 
and bounds. 

“The Masters appeared two-thirds 
of a century ago. In that time, hu- 
man civilization has virtually dis- 
appeared. Our political institutions 
are in shambles; our economy is 
little more than bartering now; there 
are practically no artists left.” 
“Among Dingoes perhaps. But 
under the Mastery, civilization is 
flourishing as never before in man’s 
history.” 

“Cows were never more civilized 
than when we bred them.” 

I smiled. “You’re playing with 
words.” 

“Perhaps you’d rather not argue.* 
“I’d rather argue. If it keeps me 
away from the hangman — or who- 
ever you employ for such purposes.” 
“Perhaps you can avoid him alto- 
gether. Perhaps, Dennis, I can con-

IF 




vince you to become a Dingo?” The 
man’s thick, violet lips distended in 
a wolfish grin. His eyes, which were, 
like his eyes in the portrait, vivid 
with intelligence, glittered with a 
strange sort of mirth. 

I tried my best to look disdainful. 

“Isn’t it rather late to join? I 
should think that most of the car- 
nage must be over by now. You’ll be 
ready to be defeated any day now.” 
“Oh, we’ll probably be defeated, 
but a good revolutionary can’t let 
that worry him. A battle that isn’t 
against the odds would hardly be 
a battle at all. The carnage, I’ll ad- 
mit, is unfortunate.” 

“And unjustifiable as well.” 
“Then I won’t bother to justify 
it. Dirty hands is one of the prices 
you pay in becoming a man again.” 
“Are you fighting your revolu- 
tion just so you can feel guilty about 
it?” 

“For that — and for the chance to 
be our own Masters. Guilt and sweat 
and black bread are all part of 
being human. Domestic animals are 
always bred to a point where they’re 
helpless in the state of nature. The 
Masters have been breeding men.” 
“And doing a better job of it than 
man ever did.” 

“That, I might point out, is ex- 
actly the view a dachshund would 
take.” 

“Then let me put in a good word 
for dachshunds. I prefer them to 
wolves. I prefer them to Dingoes.” 
"Do you? Don’t make up your 
mind too quickly, or it may cost you 
your head.” 

And, with this threat, my incred- 



ible inquisitor began to chuckle. His 
chuckle became a pronounced laugh, 
and the laugh grew to be a roar. It 
occurred to me that the gleam in his 
eye might as well have been madness 
as intelligence. 

Suddenly I was overcome by a 
desire just to have done. “My mind 
is made up,” I announced, when he 
had stopped laughing. 

“Then you’ll make a declaration?” 

Apparently, he had taken the ex- 
act opposite of the meaning I had 
intended. 

“Why should you care which side 
I’m on?” I demanded angrily. 

“Because a statement from you — 
from the son of Tennyson White — 
with the strength of that name be- 
hind it — would be invaluable in the 
cause of freedom.” 

Very deliberately I approached the 
mahogany desk where the man was 
sitting, wreathed in a fatuous smile, 
and very deliberately I raised my 
hand and struck him full in the 
face. 

Instantly the room was filled witk 
guards who pinned my arms behind 
my back. The man behind the desk 
began to chuckle. 

“You beast!” I shouted. “You 
Dingo! You have the conscience to 
kidnap and murder my father, and 
then you dare ask me to make you 
a declaration of support! I can’t 
believe — if you think that — ” 

I’m afraid that I went on raving 
like that for a little while. And as I 
raved that incredible man' lay 
sprawled on the top of his desk and 
laughed until he had lost his breath. 

“White Fang,” he managed at last. 
“That is to say, Dennis, my dear

boy. excuse me. Perhaps I’ve carried 
this a little far. But you see — / 
am your father. I’m not murdered in 
the least.” 

VII 

T he next week went by at a pace 
that would have been night- 
marish if I hadn’t been so giddily, 
busily happy. First off, I married 
Julie. Daddy was adamant about 
that. He explained how Dingoes, 
especially those in the public eye, 
have to appear very monogamous. I 
had no objection to marriage, and 
if monogamy was necessary, there 
was no one I would rather have 
been monogamous with than Julie. 
She entered into the spirit of things 
with enthusiastic atavism, and I 
suspect now that part of Daddy’s in- 
sistance had had its origin in my 
bride. 

Still it was a nice wedding. Hy- 
men’s candle never burned brighter 
than on the day that our hands were 
joined over the glowing vacuum 
tube on the altar of the renovated 
power station. 

We had our first quarrel an hour 
later when she told me that she’d 
known about Daddy and the test he 
was preparing for me on the day 
that she had come to visit me at 
the jailhouse. But the quarrel ended 
as soon a? Julie had pointed out 
that, since I’d passed the test so 
well, I had no cause for anger. I 
hate to think what would have hap- 
pened, however, if I’d agreed to 
make the “declaration” that Daddy 
had proposed. 

From the first, Julie and I were 



celebrities among the Dingoes. At a 
steady succession of lunches, din- 
ners, and dances, we played the 
part of refugees from the “tyranny 
of the Masters, grateful for our new- 
found freedom.” That’s a quote from 
the speech Daddy wrote for me to 
deliver on such occasions. It al- 
ways drew applause. Dingoes have 
no taste. 

While I acted my role as a mod- 
el revolutionary, I carried on an- 
other more significant drama in- 
wardly. Had it been merely a con- 
test between filial piety and my 
loyalty to the Masters, I would not 
have hesitated long, for filial piety 
is negligible when, for seventeen 
years, you have presumed your 
father dead. 

But mine had been no ordinary 
father. He had been Tennyson 
White, and he had written A Dog*s 
Life. Now I discovered there was 
a sequel to that book. 

I read through The Life of Man 
in one sitting of fifteen hours’ dura- 
tion. It was one of the most shat- 
tering experiences in my life. In 
fact, right at this moment, I can’t 
remember any others to compare. 

Anyone who’s read it realizes the 
difficulty one faces trying to des- 
cribe it. It’s got a little bit of every- 
thing: satire, polemic, melodrama, 
farce. After the classic unity of A 
Dog’s Life , the sequel strikes at one’s 
sensibilities like a jet of water from 
a high-pressure hose. It begins with 
the same light irony, the same sub- 
dued wit, but gradually — it’s hard 
to say just when — the viewpoint 
shifts. Scenes from the first novel 
are repeated verbatim , but now its 



114 



IF 




pleasantries have become horrors. 
Allegory gives way to a brutal, 
damning realism; and every word of 
it seemed an accusation aimed di- 
rectly at me. 

After the first reading, I had no 
more distinct memory of it than I 
would have had of a hammer blow. 
And so I entirely overlooked the 
fact that The Life of Man is auto- 
biography from first to last. 

M y father Tennyson White be- 
longed to the first generation 
of men who grew up away from 
Earth. His first visit to his native 
planet was at the age of twenty, 
and it was almost a disaster. 

Stricken with a virus infection 
(those were the days before the 
Masters had quite mastered all the 
intricacies of their pets’ physiology), 
Daddy had been abandoned to a 
rather second-rate hospital, not un- 
like the Shroeder Kennel in its in- 
difference to the pets who were put 
up there. Daddy was bedridden for 
one year, time enough to lose his 
faith in the Mastery. 

Time enough, also, for him to 
draw up the outlines for both of his 
novels. Time enough to contact im- 
portant Dingoes and map out with 
their aid a program for revolution. 
A Dog's Life was to be the overture 
to that program. 

Many authors have been accused 
of corrupting youth and debasing 
the moral coinage of their times. 
Probably none have ever set about 
it so deliberately as Daddy. 

His novel was a time-bomb dis- 
guised as an Easter egg and planted 
right in the middle of the Masters’ 



basket. It was a Trojan horse; it 
was a slow-working acid that nibbled 
at the minds of the pets — just a 
mild, esthetic tickle at first, then 
as it worked in deeper, an abrasive 
that scarred them with guilt. 

For men are not meant to be 
domestic animals. 

Those who stood the acid-test of 
that novel managed to escape to 
Earth and join the Dingoes. Those 
who didn’t (and sadly, these were 
by far the majority) stayed with the 
Masters and incorporated the mon- 
strous satire of A Dog's Life into the 
fabric of their daily lives. They be- 
came dogs. 

Ten years after the publication of 
A Dog's Life , Daddy effected his 
own escape to Earth. 

His autobiography makes no men- 
tion of the fact that he left his two 
sons behind when he went over to 
the Dingoes, and he refuses to talk 
about it still. I have always sus- 
pected that he doubted, if only slight- 
ly, whether he Was doing the right 
thing. It was a large enough doubt 
that he was willing to let us decide 
for ourselves whether we wished to 
become Dingoes or remain Leashed. 

The Earth was swarming with 
refugees from the Mastery, and the 
revolutionary movement — the 
Revolutionary Inductance Corps, or 
RIC — was getting on its feet. 
(Naturally, the Dingoes did not want 
to call themselves Dingoes .) Daddy’s 
next task was more difficult, for 
he had to forge an army from the 
unorganized mass of apathetic Din- 
goes who had never left Earth. The 
Life of Man accomplished part of 
this purpose, for it showed the Din-

115 




goes what they were: an amorphous 
mass of discontent, without program 
or purpose; a race that had taken 
the first step towards its own extinc- 
tion. 

But the Dingoes were not such 
novel-readers as the pets. Only the 
more thoughtful read his second 
novel, and they didn’t need to. Dad- 
dy gradually realized that no amount 
of literature would spark the tinder 
of the Dingoes into a revolutionary 
firebrand. 

And so it was (and now we leave 
Daddy’s autobiography and enter 
the sphere of raw history) that my 
father invented a mythology. 

The Dingoes were ripe for one. 
Ever since the appearance of the 
Masters (who bore an unfortunate 
resemblance to mankind’s favorite 
gods), organized religion had gotten 




quite disorganized. Men of religious 
or mystical sensibilities were among 
the first to volunteer for the ken- 
nels, where they could contemplate 
the nearly divine nature of the Mas- 
ters without any of the discomforts 
of the ascetic life. 

The Dingoes, on the other hand, 
found it difficult to venerate gods 
who so much resembled their sworn 
enemies. 

Daddy realized that under these 
conditions, the Dingoes might ac- 
cept a “religion” of demonology 
and sympathetic magic. When the 
gods are malign, men turn to jujus 
and totems. 

But wax dolls and devil masks 
would no longer do, for the first 
law of sympathetic magic is that 
“Like produces like.” 

The Masters were electromagnetic 
phenomena: then what better talis- 
man than a dry cell? 

In any elementary physics text, 
there was a wealth of arcane lore, 
hieratic symbols, and even battle 
cries. Children were taught Kirch- 
off’ s Laws in their cradles, and men 
(and women) wore cork helmets to 
ward off the Masters, since cork was 
a good insulator. It was nonsense, 
but it was effective nonsense. The 
Revolutionary Inductance Corps 
won an overwhelming majority in 
the councils of the Dingoes on the 
slogan: ELECT RIC. 

Daddy became Triode in the revo- 
lutionary government, next in au- 
thority to the High Cathode him- 
self. Everyone was ready to begin 
the revolution, and no one had the 
least idea how to go about it. 

Which goes to show that it’s good 



116 



IF 




to be prepared, because that was 
when a providential sunspot short- 
circuited the Masters. 

The leaders of the Dingoes had 
managed to take the credit for 
their own good luck, but now a 
month had passed since the sunspot, 
and already the Masters had mani- 
fested themselves here and there as 
localized patches of luminescence in 
the atmosphere, hovering over their 
pets and repossessing them. In a very 
short time the Mastery would be 
established stronger than ever, unless 
the Dingoes found some way to 
stop them. 

Cork helmets may be good for 
morale, but in a real contest I’d as 
soon defend myself with a popgun. 
If the Dingoes had made any seri- 
ous plans, Daddy wasn’t telling me 
about them. 

VIII 

D addy, Julie, and I had been 
waiting in the lobby of the St. 
Paul Hotel for fifteen minutes, and 
in all that time we hadn’t seen one 
room clerk or bellboy. 

There weren’t even many guests, 
for Earth had become so depopu- 
lated during the Mastery that a roof 
and a bed were always easy to come 
by. What you couldn’t find anywhere 
was labor. Even the best hotels and 
restaurants were self-service. 

Finally Bruno and Rocky (for that 
had come to seem a better name for 
her than Roxanna) finished dressing 
and came down to the lobby. Bruno 
was wearing an unpressed cotton suit 
and a sport shirt open at the neok, 
so that a little bit of the bandage 



about his chest peeped out. Rocky 
was dressed to kill; Julie looked as 
staid as a nun in comparison. But 
when you’re only twenty years old, 
you don’t have to try so hard as you 
do when you’re thirty-two. 

We exchanged pleasantries, decid- 
ed on a restaurant, and went out to 
Daddy’s car — and thus began the 
ghastliest night of my life. 

Bruno was returning to his post in 
Duluth the next day, and we’d been 
unable to put him off any longer. 
For days he had been insisting that 
the five us — the two Schwartzes 
and the three Whites — “make a 
night of it.” I felt guilty toward 
Bruno, and at that time I hadn’t yet 
learned to live with a guilty con- 
science. I gave in. 

I would have been suspicious of 
overtures of friendship from a man 
I’d sent to the hospital and I might 
have simply supposed that, like most 
Dingoes, Bruno was chiefly interest- 
ed in making my father’s acquain- 
tance. However, his first overture 
had come before he knew my father 
was Tennyson White, and so it was 
hard to doubt his sincerity. I de- 
cided that he was only mad. 

If I felt guilty and awkward 
towards Bruno, I can’t imagine how 
Rocky felt towards me. When she 
had revealed my identity to the Din- 
goes she couldn’t have known that 
my father was the second-in-com- 
mand of the Dingoes — not, as she 
had supposed, their arch-enemy. 
Only initiated members of the RIC 
knew who their leaders were. She 
had intended to see me executed, 
and instead she had saved my life. 
Now we were sitting next to each

other in the back seat of Daddv’s 
limousine, talking about old times. 
When we got out, she managed to 
bring her spiked heel down on my 
instep with lethal accuracy, and 
once, in the middle of the dinner, 
smiling brightly and chattering all 
the while, she kicked me square in 
the shin underneath the tablecloth. 

The meal wouldn’t have gone be- 
yond the main course if it hadn’t 
been that almost all of Rocky’s re- 
marks went over Bruno’s head. He 
was dauntlessly ebullient, and when 
he started to talk, he could go on in- 
definitely. To shut off Rocky (who 
eouldn’t hear enough about our wed- 
ding), I questioned Bruno about his 
childhood, which had been (it seem- 
ed to me) spectacularly awful. For 
•he majority of Dingoes, life is one 
long battle: against the world, against 
their families, against their teachers, 
and against the decay of their own 
minds and bodies. No wonder Bruno 
was the aggressive lout that he was! 
But it didn’t make me like him any 
better. 

When the dinner was done and I 
thought we might make our escape, 
Bruno brought out an envelope from 
the pocket of his coat and announc- 
ed, as though he really expected us 
to be happy, that he had five tickets 
for the fight. 

“What fight?” I asked. 

“The boxing match at the Armory. 
Kelly Broughan’s there tonight, so it 
should be worth seeing. I bet you 
don’t see many good fights out in 
the asteroids, do you?” 

“No,” I said in defeated tones. 
“None at all.” 

“There are some beautiful gymnas- 



tic competitions, though,” Julie put 
in. 

Bruno’s laugh was the bellow of 
a wounded bull. Gymnastics was a 
good joke; beautiful was even bet- 
ter. “You’re a card, Julie. Dennis, 
that girl’s a card,” he got out be- 
tween bellows. 

Rocky’s eyes gleamed wickedly. 
“Dennis, you really must come, 
seeing that you’re such a scrapper 
yourself. And you must come too, 
Mr. White. You look worn out.” 

“What the hell,” Daddy said, “let’s 
all go. And afterwards we’ll watch 
the fireworks.” 

“I love fireworks,” Julie said, with 
forced cheer. 

We got up from the table with one 
accord. Bruno and Rocky were as 
happy as two children. Julie and 
I were glum. But Daddy . 

Daddy was in so profound an 
abyss of depression and defeat that 
he was quite literally unaware of 
most of what was going on around 
him. He knew, as we did not, that 
the Dingoes were about to shoot 
their wad that evening, and he knew, 
as the rest of the Dingoes did not, 
that their wad wasn’t worth a plug- 
ged nickel. 

All they had was atomic bombs. 

W hether it was because Bruno 
knew the gate attendant or 
because Daddy was with us, I don’t 
know, but our General Admission 
tickets got us seats at ringside. Our 
eyes had scarcely adjusted to the 
smokey light of the auditorium, when 
a bell rang and two men, modestly 
nude except for colored briefs, ap- 
proached each other, moving their 



118 



IF 




arms in nervous rhythms, circling 
about warily. One (in red trunks) 
lashed out at the other with his left 
hand, a feint to the stomach. With 
his right hand he swung at the other 
man’s face. There was a cracking 
sound as his naked fist connected 
with his opponent’s cheekbone. The 
crowd began to scream. 

Blood spurted from the man’s 
nose. I averted my eyes. Bruno, in 
his element, added his distinctive bel- 
low to the uproar. Rocky watched 
me closely, treasuring my every 
blench and wince. Daddy looked 
bored, and Julie kept her eyes closed 
through the whole thing. 

I should have done the same, but 
when I heard another thunk and a 
loud crash, curiosity overcame my 
finer feelings and I looked back into 
the ring. The man in red trunks was 
lying on his back, his expressionless 
face a scant few inches from my 
own. There was blood on it. Rocky 
was shrieking with pleasure, but 
Bruno, who felt an allegiance for 
the fighter in red trunks, shouted, 
“Get up, you bum!” 

I was about to be nauseous. I 
rose from my seat, mumbling apolo- 
gies, and found my way outside, 
where I was discreetly sick in a 
hedge across the street from the 
Armory. It was actually a very in- 
teresting experience, for it was the 
second time in my whole life I had 
thrown up. I was reminded of the 
apple I had eaten in the Nelson or- 
chard. 

The hedge bordered on a park 
which had been allowed to go to 
seed. Through the thick summer fo- 
liage I could see the glint of moon- 



lit water. I strolled down the hill- 
side to the pond’s edge. 

Down there, the din of the stadi- 
um melted into the other night 
sounds: the croaking of the frogs, 
the rustle of poplar leaves, the rip- 
pling water. It was quiet and earth- 
like. 

A full moon shone overhead, like 
the echo of a thousand poems. All 
the earthbound poets who had stolen 
the fire of their lyrics from that 
moon, age after age! It had passed 
them by, oblivious of histories, and 
it would pass me by in time. That’s 
the way that things should be. 

I knew then that I belonged to 
the Earth, and my spirit dilated with 
happiness. It wasn’t quite the right 
time to be happy — but there it 
was. Julie and the moon were part 
of it, but it was also the frogs croak-

ings, the poplars, the stadium; Dad- 
dy, cynical, aspiring, even defeated; 
partly too it was Bruno and Roxan- 
na, if only because they were so 
vital. These things melted into my 
memory of the Nelson farm, and it 
seemed that I could smell the winy 
smell of apples rotting in the grass. 

The sky was growing brighter and 
brighter. The moon . 

But was it the moon? A cloud of 
mist had gathered above the pond 
and it glowed until the full moon 
was almost blotted out behind it. 

The meshes of the Leash closed 
over my mind, and a voice inside my 
head purred kindly: White Fang, 
good boy! It's all right now. We 
heard your call. (But I hadn’t called! 
It was just that I had been so hap- 
py!) And now I've come. Your Mas- 
ter has come back at last for you. 

I cried out then, a simply cry of 
pain. To be taken away now! 
Only a few days before I had cried 
for the lack of this voice — and 
now . 

There , it soothed, there, there, 
there. Has it been bad? Has it been 
that very bad? Those terrible Din- 
goes have captured you , but it won't 
happen again. There , there. 

The Leash began gently to stroke 
the sensory area of the cortex: soft 
fur wrapped me, scented with musk. 
Faint ripples of harp-music (or was 
that only the water of the pond?) 
sounded behind my Master’s voice, 
which poured forth comforting 
words, like salve spread over a 
wound. 

Then, with a sudden pang, I re- 
membered Daddy. ( Don't think of 



your poor father, the Leash bade.) 

He was waiting for me. Julie was 
waiting for me. (We'll get Julie back , 
too. Now, don't you worry yourself 
any more.) 

Desperately I tried not to think, 
or at least to keep my thoughts so 
scrambled that I would not betray 
the things I knew. But it was exactly 
that effort that focused my thoughts 
on the forbidden subjects. 

I tried to think of nonsense, of 
poetry, of the moon, dim behind the 
glowing air. But the Leash, sensing 
my resistance, closed tighter around 
my mind, and cut through my thin 
web of camouflage. It shuffled 
through my memory as though it 
were a deck of cards, and it stopped 
(there was just time enough for me 
to catch the images then) to ex- 
amine images of my father with par- 
ticular attention. 

There was, on the very edge of 
my perceptions, a sound: Ourrp. 
Which was repeated: Ourrp. It was 
not a sound my Leash would make. 
The harp-music quavered for a mo- 
ment, becoming a prosaic ripple of 
water. I concentrated on that single 
sound, straining against the Leash. 

‘‘What is that sound?” I asked my 
Master. To answer me he had to 
stop sorting through my memories. 
Nothing. It's nothing. Don't think 
about it. Listen to the beautiful mus- 
ic, why don't you? Think of your 
father. 

Whatever was making the sound 
seemed to be down in the grass. I 
could see clearly in the wash of light 
from the cloud above me. I parted 
the grass at my feet, and I saw the 
beastly thing. Don't think about it! 



120 



IF 




The front half of a frog projected 
from the distended jaws of a water 
snake. The snake, seeing me, writhed, 
pulling his victim into the denser 
grass. 

Again the Leash bade me not to 
look at this thing, and, truly, I did 
not want to. It was so horrible, but 
I could not help myself. 

The frog had stretched his front 
legs to the side to prevent the last 
swallow that would end him. Mean- 
while, the back half of him was be- 
ing digested. He emitted another 
melancholy Ourrp. 

Horrible, I thought. Oh, horrible , 
horrible, horrible! 

Stop this. You . must . 
stop . 

The snake lashed his body, wrig- 
gling slowly backwards. The frog’s 
front feet grasped at sprigs of grass. 
His Ourrp had grown quite weak. 
In the failing light, I almost lost sight 
of the struggle in the shadow of the 
tall grass. I bent closer. 

In the moon’s light I could see a 
thin line of white froth about the 
snake’s gaping jaws. 

The cloud of light had disappear- 
ed. My Master had left, and I could 
hear Daddy calling my name. I ran 
back up to the street. He was there 
with Julie. * 

“Mastery!” Julie said. “You 
shouldn’t have run off like that. We 
came out and saw a light over the 
lake, and I was sure they’d carried 
you off.” 

“They almost did. My Master was 
there, and I was Leashed. But then 
I slipped out of it somehow. And 
he went away. He just disappeared. 
Are you all right, Daddy?” 



For he was visibly shaking with 
excitement. “Oh, quite, quite,” he 
said, paying scant attention. “I’m 
thinking.” 

“He had an idea,” Julie explained, 
“right after you ran out of the fight. 
I guess this is what happens when he 
has ideas.” * 

B runo pulled up beside us in the 
limousine and honked, not be- 
cause we hadn’t seen him, but just 
because he liked to honk. We got 
into the back seat and the car tore 
off down the street at a speed that 
it must not have hit for the last half 
a century. 

“Rocky’s making the calls you 
told her to, sir,” Bruno announced. 

“Fine. Now, Dennis, what was this 
about your Master?” 

I explained what had happened, 




WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 



121 



concluding with an account of the 
frog and the snake. 

“And while you were watching 
that, your Master just faded away?” 

“Yes. If he’d kept at me much 
longer, he’d have learned everything 
he was looking for. I couldn’t have 
stood out against him. So why did 
he go?” 

“One more question, first. What 
did you feel about that frog? Pre- 
cisely.” 

“It was ugly. I felt . disgusted.” 

“Was it anything like the way you 
felt at the fight tonight?” 

“Worse.” 

“But the same sort of thing? Ugli- 
ness, then disgust and nausea?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then those are the weapons we’ll 
fight them with! Dennis, my son! 
Before this night is over, you will 
be a great hero of the revolution!” 

“Don’t I deserve an explanation, 
or does the revolution need ignorant 
heroes?” 

“When you left the fight you look- 
ed so distressed that I was a bit 
amused. Dennis is such an esthete 
still, I thought. And then I remem- 
bered the old saw: Like Master , like 
man . Turn it around, and it’s the 
formula for our weapon: Like man , 
like Master . The Masters are just 
their own pets writ large. They’re 
esthetes, every last one of them. And 
we’re their favorite art-form. A hu- 
man brain is the clay they work in. 
They order our minds just the way 
they order the Northern Lights. 
That’s why they prefer an intelli- 
gent, educated pet to an undeveloped 
Dingo. The Dingoes are lumpy clay, 
warped canvas, faulty marble.” 



“They must feel about a Dingo 
the way I do about Salvador Dali,” 
Julie said. 

She always wanted to argue about 
Salvador Dali with me, because she 
knows I like him. 

“Or the way I feel about prize 
fights,” I suggested. 

“Or any experience,” Daddy con- 
cluded, “that offends a person’s 
esthetic sensibilities. They just can’t 
stand ugliness.” 

We were silent for a while, con- 
sidering this. Except Bruno. “Give 
yourself time, Dennis. You’ll get so 
you like a fight. Kelly just wasn’t in 
form tonight, that’s all.” 

Before I could answer, the lim- 
ousine was sailing down a concrete 
ramp into a brightly lit garage. “The 
hospital,” Bruno announced. 

A man in a white robe approach- 
ed us. “Everything is ready, Mr. 
White. As soon as we received your 
call, we set to work.” 

“The radiomen are here, too?” 
“They’re working with our tech- 
nicians already. And Mrs. Schwartz 
said she’d join her husband directly.” 
A terrible light suddenly kindled 
the night sky outside the garage. 
“The Masters!” I cried. 
“Damnation, the bombs!” Daddy 
exclaimed. “I forgot about them. 
Dennis, go with the doctor and do 
what he says. I have to call up 
RIC headquarters and tell them to 
stop the bombings.” 

“What are they bombing?” 
“They’re trying to land one in the 
Van Allen Belt. I tried to tell them 
it wouldn’t do any good. They tried 
it in 1972, and it didn’t accomplish 
a thing. But they were getting des- 



T22 



ir 




perate, and 1 couldn’t suggest any 
better plan. But now it would be dis- 
astrous if they detonated a bomb 
in the Van Allen Belt, because it 
will knock out radio communica- 
tions, and we’re going to be needing 
them. Bruno, Julie, wait in the car 
for me.” 

A team of doctors led me down 
the long enamel-white corridors to 
a room filled with a complicated ar- 
ray of electrical and surgical equip- 
ment. The doctor-in-chief indicated 
that I was to lie down on an un- 
comfortable metal pallet. When I 
had done so, two steel bars were 
clamped on either side of my head. 
The doctor held a rubber mask over 
my mouth and nose. 

“Breathe deeply,” he said. 

The anesthetic worked quickly. 

IX 

D addy was yelling at the doctor 
when I woke up. “Did you 
have to use an anesthetic? We don’t 
have time to waste on daintiness.” 
“The placement of the electrodes 
is a very delicate operation. He 
should be awake in any moment.” 
“I’m awake,” I said. 

The doctor rushed over to my 
pallet. “Don’t move your head,” he 
warned. Rather unnecessarily, it 
seemed, for my head was still clamp- 
ed in the steel vice, although I was 
now propped up into a sitting posi- 
tion. 

“How are you feeling?” Daddy 
asked. 

“Miserable.” 

“That’s fine. Now, listen: the ma- 
chine behind you (“Don’t look,” the 



doctor interrupted.) is an electro- 
encephalograph. It records brain 
waves.” 

The doctor broke in again: “There 
are electrodes in six different areas. 
I’ve tried to explain to your father 
that we’re uncertain where percep- 
tions of an esthetic nature are cen- 
tered. Little work has been done 
since — ” 

“Later, doctor, later. Now what 
I want Dennis to do is suffer. Actual- 
ly, it’s White Fang who will suffer. 
White Fang must drown in misery. 
I’ve already arranged some suitable 
entertainments, but you should tell 
me right now if there’s anything 
especially distasteful to you that we 
might get. Some little phobia all 
your own.” 

“Please — explain what this is 
about?” 

“Your electroencephalograms are 
being taken to every radio station 
in the city. The wave patterns will be 
amplified and broadcast over AM 
and FM. Every station in the coun- 
try, in the world, is standing by to 
pick them up. Tomorrow night we’ll 
give the Masters a concert like 
they’ve never heard before.” 

A man in workclothes brought m 
a blackboard and gave it to Daddy. 

“Doctor, you have better finger- 
nails than I do. Rub them over this 
slate.” It made an intolerable noise, 
which the doctor kept up for a 
solid minute. 

“How does the graph look?” Dad- 
dy asked. 

“Largest responses are in the sen- 
sory area. But fairly generalized else 
where, especially during the firsr 
twenty seconds. ” 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO 




“Well, there’s lots more coming. 
Look at these pictures, Dennis.” He 
showed me illustrations from a medi- 
cal encyclopedia that I will refrain 
from describing here. The people in 
the pictures were beyond the reach 
of medicine. Beyond the reach, even, 
of sympathy. 

“The response is stronger and 
more general now. Quite well de- 
fined.” 

Daddy passed a vial of formalde- 
hyde beneath my nose. It was actual- 
ly more a bottle than a vial, and in 
it — 

I screamed. 

“Excellent,” the doctor said. 

“Bring in the band,” said Dad- 
dy. 

A crew of four men with musical 
instruments I was unfamiliar with 
(they were, I’ve since learned, elec- 
tric guitar, musical saw, accordion, 
and tuba) entered the room. They 
were dressed in outlandish costumes: 
glorified work clothes in garish 
colors garnished with all sorts of 
leather and metal accessories. On 
their heads were ridiculous, flaring 
bonnets. 

“Extraordinary,” the doctor said, 
“he’s already responding.” 

“Go to it, boys,” Daddy said. 

They began — well, they began 
to sing. 

It was like singing. Their un- 
tuned instruments blasted out a 
stupid One-two-three, One- two-three 
repetitive melody, which they ac- 
companied with strident screams of 
“Roll out the bare ul.” When I 
thought that this new attack on my 
sensibilities had reached the thresh- 
old of tolerance, Daddy, who had 



been watching me intently, leaped 
up and began to slam his feet on 
the floor and join them in that aw- 
ful song. 

Daddy has a terrible voice for 
singing. It rasps. 

But his voice was the least of it; 
it was his behavior that was so mor- 
tifying. I wanted to turn my head 
away, but the vice held it fast. For 
a man of such natural dignity to so 
debase himself, and that man my 
own father! 

This was, of course, just the re- 
sponse Daddy was looking for. 

When they had finished their gross 
display, I begged for a moment’s re- 
prieve. Daddy dismissed the band 
and returned the accordion player his 
cowboy hat. 

“Don’t work him too hard, until 
we have some idea of his breaking 
point,” the doctor advised. “Besides, 
I’d like to see the intern just a min- 
ute, if you’ll excuse me. The photo- 
graphs gave me an idea: th£re are 
some patients in the hospital ...” 

“Have you thought of anything, 
Dennis?” 

“In a way, yes. Is Bruno still 
around?” 

“He should be downstairs,” 

“If he were to tell me about the 
things he enjoys — the very worst 
things — in the long run he might 
think of more horrors than you. 
They seem to come naturally to 
him.” 

“Good idea. I’ll send for him.” 

“Roxanna, too, if she’s down there. 
I remember how she watched me at 
the boxing match. She’d be able to 
help you quite a lot.” 

As Daddy left the room, the doc- 



124 



IF 




tor returned, escorting a caravan of 
litters. Photographs are no equiva- 
lent for the real thing. 

I t went on that way for four hours, 
and every minute seemed worse 
than the one before. Bruno had a 
limitless imagination, especially when 
it was abetted by alcohol and his 
wife. 

He told me about his favorite 
fight to begin with. He told me what 
he would like to do with pets, and 
what he would like to do, if he had 
more time. Then he discoursed on 
the mysteries of love, a subject on 
which Rocky, too, was eloquent. 

After two hours of these and other 
pleasures, I asked to have some cof- 
fee. Rocky left for it and returned 
with a steaming mug from which I 
took one greedy swallow before I re- 
alized it was not coffee. Rocky had 
remembered how I felt about blood. 

When I had been revived with 
smelling salts, Daddy brought in 
more entertainers. They had come 
to the hospital directly after their 
last fight at the Armory. For some 
reason, most of what happened after 
that point I can no longer remem- 
ber. 

f 

X 

W e were out on the tile terrace 
of the hospital, Daddy, Julie, 
and I. Below us the Mississippi was 
a pool of utter blackness and un- 
known extent. It was an hour after 
sunset, and the moon had not yet 
risen. The only light came from the 
North, where the great auroral flood- 
light swept out from the horizon 




across the constellations. 



“Five minutes,” Daddy announced 
nervously. 

In five minutes radio stations all 
over the world would begin to broad- 
cast my performance of the night 
before. I had heard an aural equiva- 
lent of my electroencephalograms, 
and I wasn’t worried. In a war based 
on esthetics, that recording was a 
doomsday machine. 

“Does your head still hurt?” 
Julie asked, brushing a feather-light 
hand over my bandages. 

“Only when I try to remember 
last night.” 

“Let me kiss the hurt away.” 

“Three minutes,” Daddy an- 
nounced, “and stop fhat. You’re 
making me nervous.” 

Julie straightened her blouse, 
which was made of some wonderful. 



WHITE FANG GOES DINGO

sheer, crinkly nylon. I had really be- 
gun to admire some of the uses of 
clothing. 

We watched the aurora. All over 
the city, lights had been turned off. 
Everyone, the whole world, was 
watching the aurora. 

“What will you do now that you’re 
High Cathode?” Tulie asked, to 
make conversation. 

“In a few minutes the revolution 
should be over. I don’t think I’d 
like administrative work. Not after 
this,” Daddy said. 

“You’re going to resign?” 

“As soon as they let me. I’ve got 
the itch to paint some more. Did you 
know I paint? I did a self-portrait 
once that’s over my desk. I think 
it’s pretty good. In any case, it’s 
traditional for retired generals to 
paint. And then I might write my 
memoirs. I’ve picked a title for them: 
The Esthetic Revolution” 

“Ten seconds,” I said. 

We watched the northern skyline. 
The aurora was a curtain of bluish 
light across which bands and stream- 
ers of intense whiteness danced and 
played. 

At first you couldn’t notice any 
difference. The spectacle glimmered 
with the same rare beauty that has 
belonged to it from time immemorial, 
but tonight its beauty was that of a 
somber Dies Irae , played just for us. 



Then one of the white bands that 
was shooting up from the horizon 
disappeared, like an electric light 
being switched off. It seemed un- 
naturally abrupt, but I couldn’t be 
sure. 

For a long while nothing more 
happened. But when five of the arc- 
ing lights snapped out of the sky 
at the same moment, I knew that 
the Masters were beginning their 
exodus. 

“Elephantiasis, I’ll bet.” 

“What’s that, Dennis?’* 

“The picture you showed me. I 
can remember it very clearly.” 

The auroral display was less 
bright by half when they came to 
the hillbilly band. I turned on the 
radio just to be sure. Through all 
the blasts and shrieks and whistles 
of my neural patterns, there was an 
unmistakable rhythm of Oom-pah- 
pah, Oom-pah-pah. 

When the broadcast came to 
Rocky’s unspeakable potion, there 
was a tremendous blast across the 
heavens. For an instant the entire 
sky was stained white. The white 
faded. The aurora was only a dim 
blue-white shadow in the north. 
There was hardly a trace of beauty 
in it. It flickered meaninglessly in 
random patterns. 

The Masters had left Earth. They 
couldn’t stand the barkings. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor : 

I quit buying If a couple of years 
ago because most of the stuff print- 
ed in it was second best. Now it's 
the best science-fiction magazine on 
the market. What happened? 

I just read the first installment 
of Star child and, knowing me, I 
will probably miss the other two 
installments. But I’ll try not to. 
It's starting out to read like many 
of the old-time novels. That's what 
makes it so interesting. A lot of 
science fiction is becoming dull and 
boring. It seems most of the writ- 
ers are of the mind that whatever 
they write should be reasonably able 
to come true. Which is fine if you 
want to be a forecaster. Me, I like 
my science fiction unbelievable and 
with all kinds of impossibilities like 
spacelings and pyropods. 

I'm in complete accord with Mr. 
John Cochran and his wishes to 
have good science fiction brought 
to television. I'm sick of having 
to defend science fiction novels to 
all my friends who don't read it, 
after they've seen some monster 
movie. But how do we go about 
it? Mr. Cochran suggests writing 



the networks. I don't think that 
would work simply because all of us 
good-intentioned people won’t write. 
We'll all sit back and think the 
other one is doing it ... or we’ll 
think no one is doing it and we won't 
want to be the only one. There must 
be someone out there in readerland 
who has the perfect solution in his 
mind ... so please write to If and 
let's see what can be done to fur- 
ther good sf on TV. 

When are you going to have more 
Cordwainer Smith and his wonder- 
ful underpeople stories? Will they 
ever be put in a novel? I can't 
seem to get enough of them. 

Now, if you have the time could 
you answer a few questions for me? 

If a would-be writer sent you a 
story with a good plot, etc., but it 
was not well written, what would 
you do? There must be all kinds of 
people like myself!) who have over 
developed imaginations, but lack the 
special talent it takes to put it 
down on paper. 

Don't suggest a writing school 
Not only do I not have the time 
but my work keeps me moving from 
month to month and I never know 



127 





where I might be tomorrow. Be- 
sides, sometimes I'm convinced I'm 
too stupid to learn anything any 
more — things like spelling, sentence 
structure and all the things it takes 
to be a good writer. Or more like- 
ly the truth is I'm just too lazy. 
— Ramona Alderson, Box 102, Knee- 
land, California. 

• What happened? Well, for one 
thing — a lot of hard work happen- 
ed! 

Cordwainer Smith has gone from 
underpeople to Down Under people 
for a while — he's on a research sab- 
batical among the aborigines in New 
Zealand. But he'll be fcack in pro- 
duction before long, and when he 
is we'll try to get him back in //. 

What to do with a story that has 
a good idea but no literary skill? 
You've put your finger on the hard- 
est problem of them all. (Fortun- 
ately for an editor's peace of mind, 
it doesn't happen often — most peo- 
ple, by the time they have anything 
to say in the first place, can usual- 
ly manage to say it in a present- 
able way.) All we really can do 
when it does happen, though, is say : 
Don't be “too lazy''. Do learn your 
skills. Do work at writing . 
Sometimes it works. At least three 
of today's best sf writers started 
out terrible and gradually, painful- 
ly, learned their craft. — The Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I agree whole-heartedly that you 
should enlarge the most exciting 
part of If, namely Hue & Cry. Why 
don't you use microscopic print, 
such as they did in the days of 
Startling and Thrilling Wonder? 
This would probably appease those 
who enjoy the fiction more than the 
lettercol. You'd get more in the same 
amount of space. You did use small- 
print letters before Farnham’s Free- 



hold pushed Hue & Cry out for 
three issues. Why not go back? 

Being a relative newcomer to 
the world of sf magazines (they're 
awfully hard to find out here), I 
looked forward with mixed emo- 
tions to my first Retief story. Then 
when I read it, I couldn't make 
heads nor tails of what was up. 
From then on I skipped the Retief 
tales, wondering why you were so 
proud of having all of his adven- 
tures in //, exclusively. But the 
other day I bought a collection of 
Retief stories and after reading the 
first one, I understood what Retief 
was all about. Then I went back 
and eagerly devoured all the other 
Retief stories I had accumulated, 
and now I easily see why you are 
so proud of yourselves. (It was 
your recent Laumer serial that 
gave me the idea that the Retief 
series might be worth reading.) 

Your covers: The December '64 
cover was even better (believe it 
or not) than the October '64 cover 
was bad. These were your extremes, 
covering an unbelievable range, for 
1964. Or any other times, for that 
matter. I've never seen a better 
cover than the one on the Decem- 
ber issue. 

Well, I guess I've been a pain 
in the neck long enough. You may 
find it hard to believe after all 
this, but I like your mags better 
than the others. Well, at least most 
of the time. — Danny Hughes, -634 
Nolen Drive, Indianapolis, Indiana 
46234. 

• Small print? Good idea! — The 
Editor . 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

On the editorial page of your 
December, 1964 issue you say, “In 
every issue of IF we run a ‘first' 
story by someone who has never 



128 



IF 




before appeared in a professional 
magazine. This months is L. D. 
Ogle's The Heat Racers , a fresh and 
pleasing tale." WELL, I looked 
through that magazine page by 
page and I didn't find any story 
by L. D. Ogle called The Heat Rac- 
ers. Any explanations? 

Answering John D. Cochran in 
the same issue: It's my firm belief 
that so-called science fiction in TV 
and movies is not science fiction. 
They are really just plain old hor- 
ror movies, although I do agree 
with you that Outer Limits comes 
close. It is also my opinion that the 
reason these are horror shows is the 
basic evil of man showing. As you 
can see, they always show the alien 
as an enemy. Every monster is out 
to kill people and to destroy our 
cities. 

I think this is the basic emotion 
of man coming through. How do 
you think the great civilizations of 
the past became so? By slavery and 
murder — by the same basic sur- 
vival pattern of an animal, that the 
strong shall survive by feeding upon 
the weak. I can just see what would 
happen now if we met beings from 
another planet. At first fear and 
an attempt to destroy them. Then, 
if we find we are stronger, we will 
move in and push them around — 
just as the American Indian was 
treated. 

What I am waiting for is that 
d^.y when we meet a civilization 
that is really peaceful, but after 
we make a try at showing our su- 
periority they slap us down as we 
do a small child. They tell us to 
get back into our playpen until we 
are mature enough to come out. — 
Henry K. Allen, 809 Farmers Ave- 
nue, Tempe, Arizona 85281. 

• Well, actually those ancient civ- 
ilizations didn't really get power- 



ful because they held slaves. It was 
just that slavery was the best way 
available of organizing energy then, 
of keeping the populace alive and 
creating a surplus of available ef- 
fort for state purposes. We do 
things better now ... or anyway, 
differently. 

Explanation of what happened 
to the Ogle story? Well, actually, 
we got lost in our time machine. 
We wer. thinking of the next issue. 
December's first-time-in-print au- 
thor was Larry Niven, with The 
Coldest Place. (And this month's 
is John McCallum, a Canadian fire- 
man, with Our Martian Neighbors.)

Dear Editor: 

Ever since I subscribed to If in 
June, I've liked most of the stories, 
the features and the magazine it- 
self. I hope If never goes large-size. 
I hope also that If avoids the ad- 
vertisements that clutters others. If 
should be a special, distinctive mag- 
azine — the only monthly to come 
out bi-monthly (in September), the 
publisher of Retief, the only mag- 
azine I know that has a new author 
presented every month. 

The recent stories I've liked best 
have been The Slaves of Gree , The 
Prince and the Pirate , The Castle 
of Light , Rescue Mission, The 
Hounds of Hell, The Perfect Peo- 
ple, When Time Was New , At the 
Top of the World and Pig in a 
Pokey — but they're all good. (Inci- 
dentally, The Coldest Place has been 
disproved. The back of Mercury has 
just been discovered to be 62 de- 
grees Fahrenheit.) More Cordwain- 
er Smith stories would be good. I 
like Hue & Cry and the editorials. 
If’s a good magazine ! — Charles

Dear Editor: 

Pm writing this letter in the hope 
that your fans can halt ABC in 
their plan to cancel The Outer Lim- 
its. This is the only true series on 
TV directed totally to sf, without 
the typical no-plot monster stories. 
The episodes have mostly very weak 
plots aixd very few times do they 
come from actual stories written by 
sf authors. 

If all science-fiction fans sent in 
a letter to ABC asking to keep 
Cuter Limits on the air, then they 
would have to turn our way. — Tom

Dear Editor: 

I wonder whether someone could

It left frosted footprints and was 
apparently a sort of energy sump.

For some time the main way to

1954, and if so what their titles, 
magazines and dates were? 

By the way, how about getting 
Miss Norton to serialize her excel- 
lent stories in //, and maybe a few 
from Hal Clement? — Jack Baldwin, 
405 North Alison Street, Santa Bar- 
bara, California 93103. 

• Andre Norton? We'd like that. 
Hal Clement? Well, how about next 
month? — The Editor . 

♦ * * 

That's about all we can get in this 
time. Back next month with more 
letters, if we can find the room . 
and with some stories that are going 
to squeeze that room pretty tight, 
come to think of it. First there's 
the conclusion of John Brunner's 
The Altar at Asconel . then there's 
a 1-o-n-g novelette by Hal Clement 
called Raindrop (you'll like Rain- 
drop! It's a great, orbiting globe 
of water out in space) . and what 
else we'll have room for, only time 
and the printers will tell. 

Then comes June, beginning Sky- 
lark DuQuesne (yes, it was worth 
waiting for!) Then July has more 
of the Skylark, plus another 1-o-n-g 
novelette by a new collaboration 
team that we think will make their 
mark in science fiction. The name 
of the story: Research Alpha. The 
names of the writers : James H. 
Schmitz and A. E. Van Vogt. Also, 
there are assorted Fritz Leibers and 
Keith Laumers to go in somewhere, 
and — well, wait and see! — The 
Editor .

“We’re looking for people who 
want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School; Former 
editor, Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing apti- 
tude. We’ll help you find out if you can 
be trained to become a successful writer. 

Three years ago, we started the Famous 
Writers School to help people who want 
to write acquire the skill and craftsman- 
ship it takes to break into print. Over 
many months, we poured everything we 
knew about writing into a new kind of 
professional training course, which you 
take at home and in your free time. The 
course begins with the fundamentals of 
good writing upon which every writing 
career must be built. Then you get ad- 
vanced training in the specialty of your 
choice — Fiction, Non-Fiction, Adver- 
tising or Business Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers. Your instruc- 
tor spends up to two hours analyzing 
your work. He blue-pencils corrections 



right on it — much as an editor does with 
established writers. Then he returns it to 
you with a long personal letter of advice 
and specific recommendations. 

Our School is young. Yet students, 
many still in training, have sold their 
work to more than 100 publications. 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can benefit from 
this training, send for the School’s re- 
vealing Aptitude Test. If you test well, 
or offer other evidence of writing ability, 
you may enroll. However, there is no 
obligation to do so.
