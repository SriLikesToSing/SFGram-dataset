MIRACLE 
ON MICHIGAN 


T he future is a pretty nice place 
to live. I know — I’ve just been 
there. 

On certain Chicago TV stations, 
at the break, you’ll see a photo- 
graph of a startling structure — 
twin towers studded with little 
curved balconies — which the Sec- 
ond City is using more and more as 
a city symbol, like Paris’s Eiffel 
Tower, New York’s Statue of Lib- 
erty, San Francisco’s Golden Gate 
Bridge. I had the very great privi- 
lege of meeting the architect — 
and the dreamer, and the one-man 
dynamo, who is responsible for the 
structures known as Marina City. 


The towers (and a flat office 
building, and a 4000-seat theater, 
under construction when I saw it) 
stand at the edge of the Chicago 
River not far from Lake Michigan. 
Each tower begins from ground 
level, with a spiral ramp with a 
roadway wide enough for two cars 
and radial wings where cars are 
parked; this spiral rises nearly a 
hundred feet before the building it- 
self begins. Altogether the towers 
are about sixty stories high. The 
central core contains elevator 
shafts, ' and the apartments radiate 
out from this core. Each has its lit- 
tle balcony.

The rooms are unusually shaped 
but extremely comfortable. The odd 
shape becomes less so when you re- 
alize how seldom, in your own 
square or rectangular room, you 
actually use the corners. More of- 
ten than not you’ll have an easy- 
chair shoved in there, or even a 
china-closet or a TV catercornered. 
If you cut the corner right off, 
chances are you wouldn’t miss it. 
The gently rounded pie - segment 
shape of the Marina City rooms is 
therefore functional and pleasing. 
Closet space is ingeniously placed in 
the apartments. The rentals are 
mid-range, running from $115 up 
— not excessive for a centrally lo- 
cated wonder like this. 

So much for the Up. But down 
from ground level — way down — 
you will find slips for 75 motor- 
boats, plus service areas, plus stor- 
age space for 700 more boats. 

T was given a guided tour by Mr. 
Robert Goldberg, the architect, at 
night. Standing between them and 


looking up, I was ready to swear 
those towers were hooked right on 
to the stars. And as cars pulled up 
and down the ramps, their head- 
lights slashed time and again diag- 
onally across the glass-and-concrete 
face of that backdrop of an office 
building. Beautiful. I sincerely envy 
him the knowledge that he will 
leave behind him such a durable 
monument. 

Here’s the future. Buildings like 
this, with schools, theaters, offices 
and stores — beautiful and func- 
tional buildings — will obsolete the 
chrome cracker-boxes for good and 
all, and they should. 

And — practical? Here’s the 
thing that flabbergasted me. My 
house stands on about three acres. 
So does Marina City — with space 
for two thousand people and their 
cars and boats, and an office build- 
ing and theater to boot! 

You’re going to see more of 
these. Watch for them and be glad.

BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 

ILLUSTRATED BY LAWRENCE 


I 

T he summer of Matthew North’s 
life was a dream so deep in 
his past that he sometimes doubted 
whether he had really dreamed 
k. Autumn had set in eons ago, 
it seemed, and now winter was 
on hand. He did not find its cold 
and bitter breath the least bit to his 

living. 

Once again, pale Hyperion was 
coming forth to meet him. Once 
again, resplendent Saturn was ad- 
vancing in her ice-blue gown. How 


The weird old castle on Saturn's 
moon was a fortress — protecting 
a dynasty and a terrible secret I 


many times before had mother and 
daughter greeted him at journey’s 
end? How many times before had 
they seen his sleek jettractor emerge 
from the immensities with a big 
black egg impaled upon its prow? 

Too many times. 

Well, there would be no more 
times. The Bimini base was gone, 
and the mysterious source of the 
many payloads which he and the 
other jettractor-pilots had delivered 
to the House of Christopoulos down 
through the centuries was buried be- 
neath the raging waters of a new- 


7 


bom sea. The unanticipated tecton- 
ic revolution had begun mere hours 
after he had blasted off from the 
little Proxima Centauri planet 
which Nick the Greek had chris- 
tened “Bimini” some five hundred 
years ago. 

For a long while Matthew had 
been in a state of shock. Recov- 
ering from it, he had radioed the 
news on ahead. He could just as well 
have waited, though, and delivered 
the news by word of mouth, for 
while radio waves exceeded his jet- 
tractor’s near-photic velocity, they 
did not exceed it by very much. 
In all probability the message had 
preceded his arrival by no more 
than a few weeks. 

Such proved to be the case. Mes- 
sage received last week, the words 
that suddenly spelled themselves out 
on the luminous bulletin-panel in- 
formed him. Establish capsule in or- 
bit, memorize but do not record 
readings, then land and proceed to 
the Hostel , there to await further 
instructions . — Zeus Christopoulos 
IX. 

“Orders acknowledged, sir,” said 
Matthew North. “Will proceed as 
directed.” 

P recisely as directed. One does 
not question the commands of 
God, no matter how unorthodox 
those commands may be. And to 
Matthew North, Zeus Christopou- 
los IX was God, just as the previous 
male descendants of Nick the Greek 
had been God. The fact that Mat- 
thew had never laid eyes on any of 
these gods argued for rather thaq 
against their divinity, and the fact 

a 


that he had never been permitted 
to set foot inside the House of 
Christopoulos bolstered rather than 
undermined his respect for them. 

Choosing a polar orbit of max- 
imum altitude, he reduced the jet- 
tractor’s momentum to the velocity 
he wanted. Then, after mentally re- 
cording his instrument readings, he 
disengaged the capsule and fired his 
retros. He watched the huge egg- 
shaped container dwindle into the 
blue-black distances and fade from 
sight. Finally he began orbiting in. 

Saturn hove into sight with each 
crossing of the twilight belt, but 
each time he saw not Saturn but a 
rich and dazzling jewel hanging up- 
on the Brobdingnagian cheek of the 
Ethiope goddess Space — the black 
bitch-goddess of vast immensities 
and burning suns at whose cold and 
unfeeling feet he had laid the best 
years of his life. “For you, Zeus, I 
did this thing,” he said, unconscious- 
ly lumping the successive heirs into 
a single entity. “For you I put my 
years upon the block in order that 
your House might never be without 
the precious payloads I have deliv- 
ered to its door — payloads I have 
never seen and do not even know 
the nature of. And now they are 
no more. 

“Now I have come home to die.” 

But he had no true right to re- 
gret, and he knew it. He had put 
his years upon the block, yes — but 
no one had forced him to, and he 
had not auctioned them off for 
nothing. With them he had bouj’U 
a safe little island of changelessness 
in the giddy onrushing torrent of 
time. 

IF 








N ight passed, and came the 
day, the pale day with its cold 
and distant sun and its wan, cold 
stars. 

Gliding downward along an ever- 
shrinking orbital path, firing his ret- 
ros with the passing of each dawn, 
Old Matt North became Young 
Matt North again — Young Matt 
North standing in a bustling bar 
that bewildered him, rubbing shoul- 
ders with strangely garbed, gesticu- 
lating people who frightened him; 
Young Matt North recently re- 
turned from a Hyperion-Sirius XXI 
run, adrift in a civilization that, 
thanks to the Lorentz-FitzGerald 
contraction, had left him almost 
two decades behind. 

Beside him stood the man from 
the House of Christopoulos who 
bad spotted him from across the 
room. He had come over and bought 
him a drink and told him glowing- 
ly about the Great Opportunity. 
“You paint a pretty picture,” Young 
Matt said. “I’ll say that much for 
you.” 

The man was young — almost as 
young as Young Matt North. His 
cheeks were smooth and plump, 
and you could smell money on his 
breath. Zeus I was his shepherd — 
he did not want. 

“As true a picture as it is pretty, 
Matthew North,” he said. “The 
House of ‘Christopoulos takes care 
of its spacemen. It doesn’t cast them 
adrift between runs the way the 
commercial carriers do. Zeus I was 
a spaceman once himself — 
he knows what it’s like to be cast 
adrift. That’s why he spared no ex- 
pense when he built the Haven. 


That’s why he duplicated a sane and 
sensible setting out of the past in- 
stead of building a modern setting. 
That’s why he guarantees his jet- 
tractor pilots a job for life. Thus 
far, there are only two, and he 
needs but one more, but the Haven 
is large enough to accommodate a 
hundred. And it will never chaqge. 
The Hostel will always be there 
waiting for you when you return, 
and during your six-months lay- 
overs there will be girls for the ask- 
ing, and taverns with open doors.” 

H 

I t had been true — every word 
of it. And it was as true to- 
day as it had been then . 

Old Matt North berthed his jet- 
tractor, climbed out through the 
locks carrying his duffel bag, and 
walked around the big platform-lift 
on which he had lowered so many 
capsules into the subterranean pneu- 
motube that led to the crypts be- 
neath the House of Christopoulos. 
The little port gave directly onto 
the single street of the Haven, and 
he walked down the street toward 
the big stone structure at its far- 
ther end. As always, the sight of the 
Hostel reassured him. There was a 
permanence about stone that could 
not be duplicated, a solidity that 
other materials lacked. Inside, there 
would be warmth and welcome, and 
more food than he could eat and 
more wine than he could drink. And 
there would be girls, too. If he still 
wanted them. 

He wondered if he did. 

It was mid-morning, and a cold 


10 


IF 



wind was blowing in from the sur- 
rounding ice-flats. It outlined his 
spacetogs against his spare frame 
and ridged his skin with gooseflesh. 
Beyond the Hostel, the great pile of 
the House of Christopoulos stood 
massively against the gray, star- 
starved sky. It had been patterned 
after the Parthenon, but in the dis- 
tance-decimated sunlight its noble 
Doric columns and magnificent en- 
tablature took on a pale cast that 
was out of keeping with the trabe- 
ate architecture. And while the 
force-field that played darkly be- 
tween the columns let in what little 
light there was, it gave back noth- 
ing in return. The over-all effect 
was one of Gothic gloom. 

Usually the House awoke vague 
longings in the deeps of Matthew 
North’s being. Today it did not — 
perhaps because he was not really 
seeing it. 

He was seeing the girls he had 
known instead — the girls he had 
slept with down through the dec- 
ades, some of whom were old and 
withered women now, and some of 
whom had lain for centuries dead. 
The pretty little call girls he had 
had with the sweet sad swiftness of 
a hummingbird’s flight and then had 
known 60 more . and now the 
room that summer dresses in new 
bloom was empty, and only the 
sporadic fluttering of the window 
curtains betrayed the presence of 
their ghosts. 

It was as well, perhaps — who 
knew? Matthew North sighed, and 
walked past the tavern doors agape. 

He avoided the expectant looks 
of the villagers — the villagers 


whose function it was to cater to 
him during his layover and see to 
it that he wanted for nothing, and 
beneath whose breasts pulsed not 
hearts but tiny motors that never 
ran down, and behind whose wel- 
coming eyes dwelled not memories 
but memory banks. Only the girls 
had been real. The rest was tech- 
nological fantasy. 

The interior of the Hostel had not 
changed one whit. Indeed, he could 
have sworn that the log burning in 
the great stone hearth was the 
same log that had been burning 
there the day he left. The hostler 
was no longer the same though. 
Matthew stared at the small and 
portly — and unquestionably human 
— man who came forth from be- 
hind the bar to greet him. The 
man smiled at his bewilderment 
“Zeus IX decided that human per- 
sonnel could do the job better,” he 
explained. “Taverns are one thing, 
but an inn needs a human touch. 
He offered me the building, and 
the keep of my wife, my daughter 
and myself if we would school our- 
selves in mid-twenty-second century 
lore, and condition ourselves to the 
early-twentieth-century way of life 
which the Hostel symbolizes. I 
agreed to do so, and here I am. 
Welcome home, Matthew North.” 

Clearly, the hostler had not as 
yet been informed that the Bimini 
base was no more. 

Matthew did not bother to en- 
lighten him, and allowed himself to 
be led over to a big wooden table 
that stood before the hearth. Pres- 
ently the hostler’s wife — a strap- 
ping woman with eyes the hue of 


rN SATURN'S RINGS 


11 



port wine — brought in steaming 
platters of food and a tall and 
dusty bottle of Venerian Chianti. 
Matthew knew an appetite he had 
not known in years and ate hugely. 
He drank largely of the wine. It 
was red and fiery, and warmed his 
very bones. Stupor stole over him. 
“I would sleep,” he said. 

T he hosteler’s wife depressed a 
buzzer at the end of the bar, 
and a moment later a tall girl with 
shoulder-length brown hair entered 
the big raftered room. She was 
wearing cling-slacks, and short 
fleece-lined boots; a white plasti- 
jacket covered her arms and shoul- 
ders, fell loosely round her hips. 
Youth shouted from her blue, 
smoke-filled eyes. “Faustina will 
show you your room,” the hostler’s 
wife said. “Ask her for whatever 
you want, and she will get it for 
you.” 

The girl came forward, picked 
up his duffel bag, shouldered it ef- 
fortlessly a^nd led the way through 
the side entrance to the period-piece 
outside-stairway. On the second 
step she paused and turned. “Would 
you like some girls perhaps?” 

The amusement in her eyes di- 
minished him. He lowered his gaze 
to the ground. “No,” he said. “Not 
now.” 

She shrugged and resumed her 
ascent of the stairs. He followed, 
marveling at the smooth flow of 
her limbs, at her graceful strength; 
at the youth that was manifest in 
her every movement. Lord, to be 
young again ! he thought. He felt 
suddenly, horribly, cheated — 


robbed of life and love. He yearned 
to lean upon her shoulder, to steal 
some of her youth and strength. He 
wanted to see desire in her eyes. In- 
stead, when she lingered for a mo- 
ment in the doorway of the room 
the hostler had prepared for him, 
he saw pity. 

She lowered his duffel bag to the 
floor. “There’s a buzzer by the bed,” 
she said. “If you need anything just 
press it.” She turned and walked 
down the hall and out dnto the land- 
ing. 

He heard her footsteps on the 
stairs. Silence came. 

The room was a large one. All 
of the rooms in the Hostel were 
large. Large and empty. 

Over the decades he had slept in 
a dozen of them. He would sleep 
in this one now, sleep the sleep of 
the dead, and he would forget stars 
and space, and loneliness. He would 
forget the pity he had seen in a 
young girl’s eyes and he would for- 
get that the only love he had ever 
known was the love that the House 
of Christopoulos had paid hard cold 
cash for, and itemized on the same 
list on which it had itemized his 
bread and wine. He would forget 
— for a little while, at least — that 
for all the slowed-down clocks that 
had given him relative immortality, 
he was an old, old man. 

He added wood to the fire in the 
big stone hearth and turned back 
the sheets of the huge four-poster 
bed. He undressed, showered, then 
climbed into the period-piece bed 
and let his weary body sink deeply 
into the eiderdown mattress. 

He thought of Bettinger and 


12 



Flynn, the other two jettractor- 
pilots. Bettinger must have reached 
Bimini by now, and seen the dark 
sea raging where once the android 
settlement and the fenced-off lake 
had been. In a few more months 
— years, if you computed the time 
objectively — Flynn would arrive 
there. Both would return with emp- 
ty capsules. 

Matthew sighed, and turned on 
his side. 

There was nothing he could do. 
The Bimini base was no more, and 
that was all there was to it. He 
thought fleetingly of the orbiting 
capsule and wondered why Zeus 
IX had not wanted it brought down; 
but the ways of God were by their 
very nature inscrutable, and not to 
be questioned, and presently Mat- 
thew North ceased wondering, and 
slept. 

A knock on his door delivered 
him up from a haunting 
dream of his lost youth. “Yes?” said 
Old Matt North, sitting up in bed. 
“What is it?” 

“You have a visitor, Mr. North.” 
“A visitor? Who?” 

There was awe in Faustina’s voice. 
“Hera Christopoulos. She’s waiting 
for you downstairs. Hurry, Mr. 
North!” 

Fading footsteps. Silence once 
again. 

For a while his consternation 
held him chained. Finally, breaking 
free, he climbed out of bed and 
pulled his best suit out of his duffel 
bag. He got into it, trembling all 
the while, and wetted and combed 
his gray and thinning hair. The dark 

IN SATURN'S RINGS 


stubble on his cheeks distressed him 
— he should have shaved before go- 
ing to bed. Now it was too late. 

Hera Christopoulos. The wife of 
Zeus IX ... 

She was tall, and coldly beauti- 
ful. Her dark eyes were set beneath 
delicate black flares of brows, and 
held in them a quality that was 
reminiscent of deep space. Her 
black hair, upswept into a twist that 
flowered out and spilled down like 
the waters of a Cknmerian foun- 
tain, stole microcosmic stars from 
the hearth-fire before which she 
statuesquely stood. A scarlet sa- 
rong, secured by a silver chain 
around her throat, swirled thrice 
around her Junoesque body and ter- 
minated in a silver band just above 
her right knee. 

She had unfastened the throat- 
clasp that had held her ermine 
cloak in place, and the cloak had 
fallen to the flagstone floor like 
snow, half-burying her sandaled 
feet, and she stood in the snow 
haughtily, the firelight heightening 
the insolence of her naked arms and 
shoulders and her semi-naked legs. 

Entering the room, Matthew 
thought for a moment that he had 
seen her before. The absurd thought 
was followed instantly by the mem- 
ory which explained it. Oftentimes 
descendants duplicated the physical 
traits of a long-dead ancestor. Here 
was a case in point. It was not Hera 
whom he had seen, but Diono 
Christopoulos — the wife of Zeus 
IV, and Hera’s great-great grand- 
mother. 

The memory, once unleashed, 
ran rampant in his mind. Once 

n 



again the long-ago night closed in 
around him — the night and the 
wine and the laughter, the girls and 
the synthetic gin. Once again he was 
forty-five and afraid. Once again 
the strange restlessness came over 
him, and suddenly the intervening 
years were no more and he was 
plunging out of the stifling Haven 
bar and into the wind-washed street. 

The coldness of the night shocked 
him, but he did not go back inside 
for his greatcoat. He welcomed the 
coldness. He reveled in it, and he 
let the icy wind wash over him as 
though he were a boulder lodged in 
midstream, delighting in the clean, 
clear current. Saturn was on high, 
a great and gleaming jewel hanging 
in the heavens, bathing the ice- 
flats in bluish light and imparting 
to the House of Christopoulos a 
majesty which the daylight would 
destroy. 

Something about the storied 
structure tied in with his restlessness. 
He set off across the flats, into the 
river of the wind. 

Ill 

r ie building was less than a 
mile distant from the Haven, 
but the wind and the ice made the 
going arduous. Only the heightened 
sugar-content of his blood enabled 
him to reach the row of artificial 
cypress trees that paralleled the rear 
line of columns. 

Gasping, he collapsed in the lee 
of a gnarled trunk and massaged 
his numb legs. When his breath re- 
turned, he peered round the trunk 
— and saw the rift. 


It was the result of a circuit de- 
fect in the force-field, and apparent- 
ly neither Alexander the Great nor 
the other three roguards had no- 
ticed it as yet. It wasn’t a largo 
rift, but it was large enough to see 
through. The trouble was, it was 
way up on the force-field wall — 
just beneath the entablature. How- 
ever a tall cypress stood not far 
away. From its topmost branches an 
enterprising man might obtain a 
glimpse of the building’s interior — 
if he wanted to badly enough. 

Matthew North did. 

He was at the base of the tree 
in a matter of seconds. Minutes 
later he was riding the wind on a 
lofty bough, chest tight from the 
climb, hands numb and bleeding. 
The rift had a pinkish cast now. The 
room beyond it was pink. 

The room was a bath. 

He had believed in his naivete 
that because the House had been 
patterned after the Parthenon, it 
must of necessity have but one 
floor. He saw now that such was 
not the case. For all the loftiness of 
its ceiling, the bath into which he 
was gazing was unmistakably a part 
of a second story. 

Apparently the rift in the force- 
field wall was on the visual circuit 
only, for the three women in # the 
room seemed unaware of the cold 
wind. 

Two of them would have been 
unaware of it in any event, for they 
were not truly women. They were 
android handmaidens. One of them 
had been created in the image of 
Helen of Troy, the other in the 
image of Hecuba. So perfectly 


14 


IF 



wrought were they, however, that 
he would not have guessed the 
truth had it not been for the names 
embroidered beneath the neck lines 
of their Grecian Tunics. 

The woman in the bath proper 
was real, though. She put to shame 
the flaming torch of Helen of Troy, 
and all but extinguished the flicker- 
ing one of Hecuba. A monogram 
on one of the huge white towels 
the handmaidens were holding re- 
vealed her identity: Dione Chris- 
topoulos. 

Matthew could not breathe. 

Dark of hair and eyes, scarlet of 
sultry, almost sullen lips, soft-white 
of water-rivuleting skin, she stood 
up in the marble basin. He saw the 
full breasts, scarlet-nippled to match 
her lips, the gracefully flowing but- 
tocks, the breathless slopes of 
gleaming thighs. As though cogni- 
zant of his presence and eager to 
flaunt the pastures in which he 
could not feed, she faced the rift 
lor one full minute before surren- 
dering herself to her handmaidens. 
He saw the birthmark then: the 
purple dagger-shaft between her 
breasts, its blade seemingly buried 
in her white flesh — 

At the same time, his eyes caught 
a movement at the base of the tree. 

Lowering them, he saw the ro- 
guard standing there. Saturn’s ice- 
blue light glittered on the Macedo- 
nian armor, on the long, lethal lance 
whose inbuilt laser tube was capable 
of leveling a mountain. Matthew 
shrank against the bough, trying to 
efface himself from view. 

He needn’t have. Antigonus or 
Seleucus or Ptolemy — whichever 


of Alexander the Great’s generals 
the roguard was — had eyes only 
for the rift and was utterly unaware 
of the Peeping Tom in the tree 
above his head. Presently he left the 
trunk and hurried round the corner 
of the House, heading for the en- 
trance where Alexander the Great 
was stationed, and leaving the coast 
clear. 

Matthew reached the ground in 
seconds, and began running across 
the flats. He was spent when he 
reached the Hostel trembling when 
he climbed into bed. All night long 
Dione Christopoulos had walked 
through his twisted dreams, and he 
had carried a mental picture of her 
standing in her bath down through 
the years to this very moment. 

T he resemblance between her 
and the beautiful young wom- 
an standing before him in the Hostel 
was striking. He had heard it said 
that interfamilial marriages had 
been the rule in the House of Chris- 
topoulos ever since Nick the Greek 
had married an indentured cham- 
bermaid — a peasant girl named 
Antonia Anzalone — and set the 
dynasty in motion. Matthew had al- 
ways discredited the rumor, but 
now he wondered if perhaps there 
might not be something to it. 

He shuffled across the room and 
paused humbly before his visitor, 
staring down at the ermine snow 
that lay around her feet. Should he 
bow? he wondered. Or should he 
kneel? In his indecision, he did nei- 
ther but stood there like the bewil- 
dered and frightened old man he 
was.

Hera Christopoulos looked him 
up and down. Her voice was as cold 
as the wind that blew across the 
ice-flats. “Where is the last cap- 
sule?” she demanded. “Why wasn’t 
k delivered to the House?” 

He could not think at first, could 
only stand there dumbly. When at 
last words came, they emerged in a 
meaningless mumble. “What did you 
say?” Hera Christopoulos asked. 

He clenched his hands in a vain 
attempt to still the trembling of 
his fingers. Faustina appeared tim- 
idly at his elbow, bearing a tray 
with two cups of coffee on it, and 
in his agitation he seized one of 
them and gulped down its throat- 
searing contents. Belatedly, he re- 
membered that he should have let 
his visitor serve herself first. Acute 
embarrassment all but over- 
whelmed him. Miserably, he re- 
turned the cup to the tray. 

Hera declined the other cup with 
a disdainful look, and Faustina hur- 
ried away. The log fire crackled, 
and the crackling reverberated 
throughout the room. “Are you 
dumb?” Hera said contemptuously. 
“Or have you only temporarily lost 
your tongue?” 

Anger sparked him into articula- 
tion, and he raised his eyes. “The 
capsuld is in orbit, in accordance 
with your husband’s directions.” 
She took a step backward, and 
the fluffy pile of ermine snow be- 
carrie a windrow. The deep-space 
darkness of her eyes intensified. “He 
ordered you to put the capsule in 
orbit. Why? 

“He did not say why.” 

“When did he contact you?” 


“This morning, just before I 
made moonfall.” 

“I order you to bring it down." 

“I can’t bring it down unlea 
Zeus IX authorizes it,” Matthew 
said. 

“Zeus IX was called away on busi- 
ness. Quite naturally I am empow- 
ered to speak for him in his ab- 
sence. I hereby countermand his 
order with an order of my own: 
Bring the capsule down and see to 
it that it is delivered to the House 
immediately.” With a catlike 
movement she bent down and 
picked up her cloak. Straightening, 
she showered it around her shoul- 
ders. “Immediately,” she repeated, 
and, turning, started for the door. 

“No,” said Matthew North. “I 
can’t.” 

She spun around, a flurry of 
whiteness and woman. “I order you 
to bring it down!” 

T he commoner in Matthew 
quivered, and the servant in 
him quaked, but his loyalty to Zeus 
IX refused to let him retreat. 

“When your husband notifies me 
and gives me the necessary order, 
I will bring it down,” he said, “but 
not before. I am sorry, but I have 
no right to act otherwise.” 

“Very well then. Give me the or- 
bital readings and I’ll have someone 
else bring it down.” 

Matthew shook his head. “I’m 
sorry,” he repeated. “I can’t do that 
either. You see,” he went on, “Zeus 
Christopoulos IX represents more to 
me than just the ninth Zeus in line. 
He represents all the others who 
preceded him. I — I have worked 


16 


IP 



for the House of Christopoulos al- 
most all my life. And I have come 
to regard my duties as a sort of 
sacred trust — a trust that I could 
never bring myself to violate. I 
would die for the House of Chris- 
topoulos. I would die for you. But 
I cannot obey your order.” 

She regarded him for some time, 
the Cimmerian fountain of her hair 
spilling darkly down to the white 
snowbanks of her shoulders. 
Thought, not anger, now resided in 
her deep-space eyes. At length, “ I 
believe you would at, that,” she said; 
and then, “Such loyalty should not 
go unrewarded.” 

Surprised, Matthew said, “It has 
not gone unrewarded.” 

“But it has not been rewarded in 
full.” She glanced at the magnified 
dial of her ring-watch. “It is now 
six-twenty. At eight-thirty you will 
arrive at the House of Christopoulos 
for dinner. That is an order. Will 
you obey it?” 

Weakness came into Matthew’s 
knees and sent his legs to trem- 
bling. His gratitude was so great that 
he could barely speak. “Yes — yes, 
I will obey it. And thank you.” 

“I will expect you then.” 

She turned and walked out of 
the Hostel, her cloak snowsqualling 
around her. She climbed into the 
glide-car in which she had come, 
the glide-car hummed to life, and a 
moment later she was gone. 

IV 

T he Alexander the Great ro- 
guard stationed before the 
multi-columned entrance of the 


House was a product of the “realis- 
tic school” of android manufactur- 
ing. He was slightly larger than his 
long-dead flesh-and-blood proto- 
type, but in all other respects he 
was a faithful reproduction. He pos- 
sessed not only his prototype’s char- 
acter but his prototype’s specialized 
knowledge as well. 

The look he bestowed upon Old 
Matt North artfully combined aris- 
tocratic arrogance and militaristic 
contempt. When Matthew said, “I’m 
Matthew North — Mrs. Zeus Chris- 
topoulos IX is expecting me,” the 
roguard acted as though he hadn’t 
heard. Nevertheless, he relayed the 
information into the tiny radio at- 
tached to his helmet. 

A moment later Hera Christop- 
oulos’ imperious voice sounded crisp- 
ly on the night air: “Well, let him in, 
you synthetic snob! I told you this 
afternoon that you were to pass 
him.’” 

Without a word Alexander the 
the Great stepped to one side and 
pointed toward the multicolumned 
facade of the House of Christopou- 
los with his laser-lance. 

Still shivering from his wind-be- 
set walk across the flats, Matthew 
approached the Pentelic marble 
steps, all the while staring nervously 
up at the frieze upon which were 
carved bas-reliefs of the divine con- 
sorts of the original Zeus — Metis, 
Maia, Leto, Dione, Demeter, 
Mnemosyne, Themis, and Eury- 
nome. Above the cornice and cen- 
tered beneath the peak of the gable 
was a big bas-relief of Hera that 
rather startlingly resembled the 
flesh-and-blood Hera with whom he 


IN SATURN'S RINGS 


17 



was about to break bread. Flanking 
it on either side, in attitudes of ab- 
ject adoration, were bas-reliefs of 
various mortals who had contribut- 
ed to the glory that was Greece. 
Some of them he recognized from 
the pictured busts and sculptures he 
had viewed on his jettractor’s library- 
tape: Thucydides, Heraclitus, Aris- 
totle, Plato, Epicurus, Sophocles. 
One of the figures was groveling at 
her feet. It was a bas-relief of Ho- 
mer. 

Night had fallen an hour ago, in 
accordance with Hyperion’s neo- 
rotational period established some 
five centuries ago at the instigation 
of Nick the Greek. Now Saturn was 
climbing into the sky. Lowering his 
eyes from the gable, Matthew be- 
gan ascending the wide marble 
steps. 

The Doric columns seemed to 
rise higher and higher above him. 
The feeling of insignificance that 
had afflicted him ever since he had 
set forth from the Hostel increased. 
He felt very small indeed when at 
last he stepped through the doorway 
that appeared transiently in the 
black curtain of the force-field, 
and into the enormous room be- 
yond, and he wished that he had 
not come. 

The room occupied the entire 
front half. of the rectangular build- 
ing. 

Strictly speaking, it was more of 
a great hall than a room. On three 
sides of it, the magnificent Doric 
columns rose up to the architrave; 
on the fourth side — the side oppo- 
site the entrance — a grand Pentel- 
ic staircase climbed majestically to 


a railed mezzanine, beyond which 
dozens of ornate doorways could be 
seen. The appointments were made 
of Pentelic marble, too — benches* 
tables, chairs. And in the center of 
the room a Pentelic marble foun- 
tain sent up an exquisite nosegay of 
twinkling water. High above the 
fountain, seemingly suspended in 
midair, an incongruous chandelier, 
wrought in the shape of a barred- 
spiral nebula, shed soft but pene- 
trating radiance. The ‘ inter-colum- 
nar force-field that so effectively 
concealed the building’s interior 
from the eyes of the outsider exist- 
ed here only as a diaphanous mist. 
Through the mist, the garish bon- 
fire of the mile-away city of Satur- 
nia showed like gentle candlelight. 

A robutler dating from the same 
“school” as the Alexander the Great 
roguard and wearing a Grecian 
tunic on the front of which the 
name Pindar was embroidered, 
came forward on sandaled feet. He 
took Matthew’s greatcoat and ear- 
flapped cap, and conducted him 
across the room to a round marble 
table that stood at the base of the 
staircase. Passing ‘ the fountain, 
Matthew gave a start when he saw 
the silvery flashes that spelled the 
presence of Venerian piranhas. 

There were hundreds of them. 
No, not hundreds. Thousands. 
Hera’s pets? he wondered. 

A fter seating him at the table, 
Pindar retired to the columnar 
sidelines. Matthew saw the other 
androids then. 

There was one standing at the 
base of each column. All of them 


18 


IF 



wore tunics and sandals similar to 
Pindar’s, and all of them save one 
were standing in statue-like immo- 
bility. The exception was an old 
“man” with a sensitive, bearded face 
who was regarding Matthew intent- 

ly. 

As Matthew watched, the an- 
droid left his column and came over 
to the table. He leaned forward, the 
tiny tubes that constituted his eyes 
alternately dimming and brighten- 
ing. Matthew remembered encoun- 
tering a similar reaction in one of 
the robartenders at the Haven. The 
robartender was a product of the 
same “school” that had produced 
the House of Christopoulos “person- 
nel”, and in common with all such 
“character” androids he could func- 
tion effectively only as long as the 
scheme of things which he had been 
built to fit into remained at least 
reasonably in keeping with his “per- 
sonal” sense of right and wrong. 

His sense of right and wrong was 
clear-cut enough. But therein lay its 
weakness. He believed that the three 
jettractor pilots should drink them- 
selves into insensibility in his bar at 
least once during their layovers, and 
when Matthew had refused to touch 
a drop during one of his (he had 
been combatihg a peptic ulcer at 
the time), the robartender had suf- 
fered a mechanical breakdown, the 
first symptom of which had been 
an alternate dimming and brighten- 
ing of his eyes. 

Matthew read the name on the 
old “man’s” tunic. “Aeschylus?” 

The old “man” nodded eagerly. 
“Yes. Aeschylus — overseer of baths 
and bedrooms.” And then, “This 


morning, darkly plotting deep with- 
in, the monarch sleeping softly by 
her side, she — ” 

“You dare leave your post after 
hours!” 

It was Hera. Hera in a sarong- 
lrke gown that glittered with dia- 
monds. Hera, tall and imperious, 
eyes abyss-dark with rage. 

Aeschylus stepped back,- eye-tubes 
working furiously. “Bumbling old 
fool,” she went on. “Get back to 
your column! You’ll be scrapped to- 
morrow — I never could stand lis- 
tening to your plays anyway. 
They’re stupid!” 

The old “man” turned and shuf- 
fled back across the floor and took 
up a stone-like stance by the column 
he had so recently left. Hera turned 
to Matthew who had risen to his 
feet. “I apologize for his presump- 
tion,” she said. “Please sit down.” 

Matthew did so, and she sat down 
next to him on the bench. There 
were lines of tiredness at her eye- 
corners — or perhaps lines of wor- 
ry; it was difficult to tell — and her 
face seemed slightly thinner than it 
had been before. 

She clapped her hands. A moment 
later a mech-maid bearing a tray 
with a tall dark bottle and two 
flower-stem glasses on it emerged 
from a doorway to the right of the 
staircase. The embroidery on her 
tunic-front revealed her name to be 
Corinna. “Will that be all, madam?” 
she asked, after setting the glasses 
and the bottle before them. 

“For the moment. Begone, kitchen 
wench!” 

Corinna departed. Hera filled the 
glasses and handed one to Matthew. 


IN SATURN'S RINGS 


19 



She raised the other. “A toast to 
your loyalty, Matthew North,” she 
said. “May it hover forever over the 
House of Christopoulos like the 
great and shining star it truly is.” 

T hey touched glasses, drank . 

The wine ignited cool fires 
within him. Lambent flames rose up 
and licked his thoughts. 

Was this the wine the House of 
Christopoulos was famous for? he 
wondered. The wine that Nick the 
Greek was reputed to have made 
his fortune on? Matthew did not 
think so. Such a wine was far too 
dear ever to have been distributed 
on the mass market. And besides, 
it was said that the real source of 
the Christopoulos fortune was the 
synthetic gin which Antonia Anza- 
lone had developed in her bathtub 
before Nick the Greek had mar- 
ried her, and which the good citi- 
zens of Earth and the Seven Satra- 
phies had been incontinently con- 
suming ever since. 

Hera refilled the two glasses, and 
clapped her hands again — twice, 
this time. Immediately Corinna and 
another mech-maid, whose name 
was Psappho, began bringing in 
viands. 

The amount and the quality of 
the food left Matthew speechless. 
The entree was Martian ptarmigan, 
a delicacy which he had never tast- 
ed before. With each course a dif- 
ferent kind of wine was served, 
none of which he had ever tasted 
before either, and each of which 
was more potent than the last. All 
that saved him from drunkenness 
was the quantity of food he con- 


sumed. And in the end this did not 
save him either, for the meal 
proved to be no more than a foun- 
dation for the wine to come. There 
was red wine and blue wine and 
amber wine, and there was even a 
red wine with a greenish cast 
which Hera said came from the 
vineyards of Sirius XVIII’s southern- 
most continent and had been aged 
in deep space. Was there another 
wine, Matthew North wondered, a 
wine that she had not served him? 
— a wine that was a product of 
Bimini and which had also been 
aged in deep space? 

He could not recall seeing any 
vineyards on Bimini, though, either 
during his orbits or during the walks 
he had been forced to take while 
the android personnel loaded his 
capsule. About all he had ever seen 
on Bimini were trees and more 
trees. That was all Bimini was, real- 
ly — or rather, all Bimini had been. 
A big jungle in the sky. 

Give or take a few lakes and 
rivers, of course — and the salt- 
water sea that had recently kicked 
over its traces. 

The ship of small talk put into 
this port and that, Hera at the helm 
and Matthew sounding a polite note 
of concurrence whenever he 
thought one was called for. Pres- 
ently it ran aground on the subject 
of Greek religious mythology. Hera 
dwelled lengthily on the Euhemer- 
istic theory of the origin of the gods. 
“Then you don’t think they were 
true gods, after all?” Matthew 
asked at length. 

She sipped her wine, set the glass 
back down. “On the contrary, Vm

IF 



positive that they were true gods. 
The mere fact that they were once 
mortal doesn’t mean that they 
couldn’t have become immortal. 
Mortality is a necessary prelude to 
immortality, just as immortality is 
a necessary prelude to the super- 
apotheosis which must logically fol- 
low. But aside from all that, the real 
proof of the immortality of the 
Greek gods has been staring schol- 
ars in the face for centuries. And 
they have been too short-sighted to 
see it.” 

“I — I guess I’m too short-sight- 
ed too,” Matthew said. 

She laughed. It was a genuine 
enough laugh, but for some reason 
it deepened rather than lightened 
the lines at her eye-corners. “They 
lived near mortals and had dealings 
with mortals when they could just 
as easily have lived by themselves 
and had nothing to do with lesser 
beings,” she explained. “Immortal- 
ity, you see, is relative. Living with 
other immortals exclusively and 
avoiding mortals, they would have 
been unable to appreciate their su- 
periority. Living near inferior be- 
ings and having dealings with them, 
they could appreciate it. It’s such a 
simple truth that the scholars have 
overlooked it, the way they’ve over- 
looked so many simple truths. 
Scholars are stupid anyway — al- 
most as stupid as philosophers.” 
She faced the staircase. “Come on 
out, old man,” she called, “and 
start cleaning off the table.” 

A n android with a block-like 
head shuffled out from behind 
the staircase. His huge face was 


ugly almost beyond belief. A strag- 
gly white beard dribbled down from 
cheeks and chin and upper lip into 
a mop-like tangle. Only the eyes 
saved the sorry visage from com- 
plete catastrophe. They were a 
clear, benevolent brown. 

The letters embroidered on his 
tunic spelled Socrates . 

He began collecting the dishes 
and the platters, and stacking them, 
his slab-like bare feet going flap- 
flap-flap on the Pentelic marble 
floor. The dishes and platters 
stacked, he started carrying them 
through the doorway to the right 
of the staircase. His movements 
were slow and clumsy. There was 
something grotesque about the 
whole performance. Something piti- 
ful. 

A scrap of ptarmigan had fallen 
to the table. Hera brushed it to the 
floor, and when the old “man” re- 
turned for his last load, she point- 
ed to the scrap with the toe of her 
sandal. “Pick it up, old man,” she 
said. 

Socrates did so, then carried the 
rest of the dishes and platters from 
the room. “Make sure you get them 
clean, old man,” Hera called after 
him. For a moment Matthew felt 
sick to his stomach. Why Socrates? 
he wondered. Why Pindar? Why 
Corinna? However, he held his si- 
lence, and presently the matter drift- 
ed from his thoughts. 

All matters drifted from his 
thoughts. All save one .... 

Hera was a strong and scented 
wind blowing through him. The 
wine strengthened the wind, and he 
found it increasingly difficult to 


IN SATURN'S RINGS 


21 



stand against it. He swayed when 
the said, abruptly and without pre- 
lude, “Will you bring the capsule 
down?” But he did not fall. Not 
quite. 

“No," he said, “I can’t.” 

She moved closer to him, the 
diamonds of her sarong-gown danc- 
ing in blinding blues and whites. 
“You would not be bringing it down 
for nothing. I pay cash!” 

“On delivery?” he he ru’d his 
strange voice ask. 

“You are an honorable man. 
Your word is good enough.” 

He swallowed. Her face was very 
close. It fascinated and repealed him 
simultaneously, but the repulsion 
was a form of fascination in itself 
— a perverted form, perhaps, but 
nonetheless compelling. The thoughts 
that it awoke added to his drunk- 
enness. He remembered that she 
was the only human being he had 
seen since entering the House, and 
he knew suddenly that they were 
alone, and that she had meant for 
them to be alone. 

“Do I have your word?” she 
asked. 

The dancing diamond-light of her 
sarong-gown half blinded him. He 
tried to speak, could not. His glazed 
eyes made speech unnecessary. She 
stood up. “You have not seen the 
mezzanine,” she said. “Come, I will 
show it to you.” 

V 

H e followed her up the mar- 
ble stairs on unsteady stilts of 
legs. Seen from above, the enor- 
mous room brought to mind the 


concourse of an ancient railroad 
terminal. The mezzanine itself was a 
graceful promenade, and the walls 
between the doors that opened off 
from it were decorated with the 
simplest of Grecian designs. Hera 
opened one of the doors and 
stepped into the room beyond. 
Trembling, he followed. 

“My bath,” she said. 

It was the same bath he had 
peered into — how many years ago 
— and seen Dione Christopoulos. 
He had been forty-five and af- 
raid then. He was still afraid, but 
he was no longer forty-five. Never- 
theless, the restlessness that had af- 
flicted him then came back. 

Now he was in a position to 
apply the cure — if making love to 
a beautiful woman who was far 
above his status really was the cure. 
In any event, it was for sale. And 
circumstances had provided him 
with the price. 

The trouble was, part of the 
price was his loyalty to Zeus IX. 

What was it that the capsule con- 
tained that Hera found so irresis- 
tible? he wondered. So irresistible 
that she could not wait till her hus- 
band returned to indulge herself? 

Drunk as he was, Matthew was 
still incapable of asking her point- 
blank. Wine or no wine, he was 
still her servant. He dared not risk 
incurring her ill-will. But was her 
motivation really important? Wasn’t 
it enough that she did want the 
capsule brought down, and that only 
he knew its celestial hiding place? 

After the bath, she showed him 
several other rooms, the last of 
which was her bedchamber. It was 


22 


IF 



a large room, and the three-dimen- 
sional murals on its walls made it 
seem even larger. The subject of the 
murals brought a blush to his with- 
ered cheeks. He had read of the 
rites for which the Temple of 
Diana at Ephesus had been famous. 
But reading about them was one 
thing — seeing them graphically de- 
picted was quite another. 

Hera was looking at him ques- 
tioningly. Light emanating from the 
obscene murals gave her flesh a 
reddish cast, deepened the darkness 
of her eyes. He looked over her 
shoulder, saw the huge sleeping dais 
with its scarlet pillows and black 
counterpane. He heard the hoarse- 
ness of his breathing and he felt 
the pounding of his heart, and he 
knew all at once that in order to 
possess her he would betray far 
more than what Zeus IX represent- 
ed; that, like all loyalties built on 
self-deception, his loyalty to the 
House of Christopoulos was worth- 
less. 

He stood there helplessly as it 
came tumbling down around him. 
‘Til bring the capsule down when- 
ever you wish,” he said. 

“Yes,” she answered absently, as 
though she had heard the words 
long before he said them. And then, 
“If you will wait outside, I will have 
my handmaidens prepare me.” She 
clapped her hands. 

Trembling, he stepped out onto 
the mezzanine. Helen of Troy 
and Hecuba appeared, side by side, 
entered the loom and closed the 
door behind them. 

His trembling increased. To re- 
lax his thoughts he walked over to 


the marble railing and looked down 
into the great room below. At the 
fountain and the tables and the 
benches. At the columns, at the an- 
droid standing at the base of each, 
as though chained. At Ictinus and 
Callicrates, the architects who had 
built the original Parthenon; at 
Phidias, the sculptor who had su- 
pervised the building; at Zeno, Poly- 
clitus, Praxiteles, Homer, Parmeni- 
des, Leucippos, Aristophanes, Soph- 
ocles, Euripides, Aeschylus — 

Aeschylus was looking up at him, 
eyes flashing on and off. 

Now the android left his column, 
crossed the floor and ascended the 
stairs. He walked over to where 
Matthew was standing and touched 
his arm. “Come,” he said, “I will 
show you so that you will believe.” 

Matthew was annoyed, “Show me 
what?” 

“I will show you,” Aeschylus re- 
peated. “Come.” 

The blink-rate of the eye-tubes 
was alarmingly high. What illogi- 
cality had this old “man” stumbled 
upon that could have upset him 
so? Suddenly curious, Matthew said, 
“All right — but you’ll have to 
hurry.” 

A eschylus led him down the 
mezzanine to an imposing 
door at the farther end. The door 
was locked, but Aeschylus produced 
a ring of keys from a pocket in his 
tunic and inserted one of them into 
the anachronistic lock. A moment 
later, the door swung obediently 
open. Following the old “man” into 
the room beyond, Matthew found 
himself in a large bath.

sky. So vivid was the illusion of 
depth that for a moment he thought 
he had stepped across space and 
time to ancient Greece. Real grass 
grew beneath his feet. The bath be- 
came a quiet pool on the bank of 
which he stood. Two life-size sta- 
tues stood on the opposite bank — 
one Pan, the other, Syrinx. Syrinx 
was running away, and Pan was in 
ithyphallic pursuit. 

Matthew looked down at the pool 
at his feet. It was perhaps nine feet 
in diameter and had a maximum 
depth of about five feet. Its con- 
cave bottom consisted of white 
marble. As he gazed into the bluish 


Peering closer, he saw other flashes. 
He identified the shining flickering 
shapes as Venerian piranhas then, 
and suddenly sober, he drew back. 
The water was alive with them! 

Why would any man — even a 
rich man who could afford to be 
eccentric — want to keep Venerian 
piranhas in his bath? 

Aeschylus was pointing toward 
the bottom of the pool. Stepping 
forward, Matthew looked down in- 
to the strange blue water once 
again — 

And saw the bones — 

The grisly bones, picked clean of 
living flesh. The white bones that 
almost matched the marble basin. 
Femurs, pelvis; empty rib box. 
Dark-socketed skull. Bone-fin-

gen, one of them still encircled by 
a ring — a ring that bore a familiar 
seal. 

The seal of the House of Chris- 
topoulos. 

Or, if you looked at it with 
Aeschylus’ eyes, the seal of the 
House of Atreus .... 

Sickened, Matthew turned away. 
“When?” he forced himself to ask. 

Aeschylus faced him. As the an- 
droid spoke, his blink-rate rapidly 
increased : 

This morning, darkly plotting 
deep within, 

The monarch sleeping softly by 
her side, 

She rose, and did with goblet 
vile 

Scoop death from waters ram- 
pant and carry it aloft, 

And pour it into this, her mon- 
arch’s pool. 

The old “man” paused. Raising 
his eyes to the counterfeit country- 
side and lifting his arms in supplica- 
tion, he went on: 

Come, Eumenides three, and 
haunt her. Dog her bloody 
trail! 

To Apollo and Athena make 
her flee. Come, do not 
wait — 

Orestes is no more; Electra 
lurks not at this sorry bier. 

Beyond the cloud-cast sky 
where once dimly shone the 
sun. 

Only darkness can be seen. 

Woe unto her — woe! 

Awake, ye fiends incarnate, and 


right this crime 
The indifferent gods looked 
down but did not see! 

Horrified, Matthew seized the 
keys which the old “man” still held 
in his hand, and ran from the room* 
He sorted through them as he hur- 
ried down the mezzanine, and by 
the time he reached the door to 
Hera’s bedchamber he had the one 
he wanted. 

He fitted it into the lock, and 
turned it. Then he tried the door. 
It did not give. 

He went loking for a visiphone. 

VI 

T he Saturnia police had to 
knock out the Alexander the 
Great and his three generals with a 
deactivation ray to gain entry. 

Matthew did not know this till he 
left the House hours later and saw 
the four “bodies” sprawled on the 
marble steps. Instinctively, he 
looked away. They brought too viv- 
idly to mind the “body” he had 
found by the piranha-infested pool 
when he had returned to the bath 
with the Saturnia Inspector of Po- 
lice. Alexander, Ptolemy, Seleucus 
and Antigonus could be re-activat- 
ed. Aeschylus could not be. Aeschy- 
lus had gone insane; his circuits had 
shorted out, blowing his eye-tubes, 
and all that remained of him now 
was a blackened shell. 

Perhaps, though, it was just as 
well. Now that the House of Chris- 
topoulos had fallen, there was no 
more need for period-piece an- 
droids. 


IN SATURN'S RINGS

Nor for period-piece spacemen. 

Old Matt North shivered in the 
raw wind that was rushing across 
the flats. He turned up the collar 
of his greatcoat, and thrust his 
hands deep into his pockets. Dawn 
was beginning to edge into the sky, 
and Saturn had long since crept to 
rest. He wondered what it would be 
like, living in a world that had left 
him over four centuries behind. He 
could not possibly adapt himself to 
it. He was too old. Too tired — 

A tired old man. 

A filthy old man. 

That was what Hera Christopou- 
los had called him when the Satur- 
nia police had led her shrieking 
from her bedchamber. Disheveled, 
half-naked in the obscene negligee 
in which she had adorned herself 
to awaken his desire and which re- 
vealed a dagger-birthmark startling- 
ly similar to Dione’s, she had 
screamed the words at the top of 
her voice. “Filthy old man,” she 
screamed, face white, and sudden- 
ly, shockingly, thin. “/ made the 
Christopoulos fortune — not Zeus I 
It was I who deserved your loyal- 
ty — not him. And you sold me out! 
Filthy old man! Filthy old Peeping 
Tom!” 

Confronted with the bones at the 
bottom of the drained pool, she had 
not even bothered to conceal her 
guilt. “It would only have been for 
twenty . or thirty more years any- 
way,” she said. “Maybe it’s better 
this way.” Abruptly her voice rose. 
“It was all his fault! There would 
have been enough in reserve to 
have lasted us for another century 
if he hadn’t squandered it, if he 


hadn’t given it away. Given it to his 
mistresses. ‘Would you be beautiful 
forever?’ he asked them, and they 
fawned at his feet. Then he sick- 
ened of them and let them wither 
away, one by one, and found others 
to give away his years to. My years. 
And then he tried to cheat me out 
of the handful we had left. Well, 
I beat him there. I’m glad I fed 
him to the fish. I hope they dined 
well.” She gave a hideous laugh. 
“I’ll bet his flesh was stringy, though. 
I’ll bet his skin was tough!” 

More laughter erupted from her, 
each burst more hideous than the 
last, and finally the police dragged 
her from the room. Then the In- 
spector began to question Matthew. 

M atthew withheld nothing. He 
had nothing to withhold. But 
the questions which the Inspector 
threw at him told him more than 
his answers told the Inspector. 

They told him that the condition 
of the bones at the bottom of the 
pool indicated that Zeus IX had 
climbed into his bath shortly after 
sending his message to Matthew. 
They told him that the House of 
Christopoulos had no heirs and that 
it would become the property of 
the Hyperion Satrapy. They told 
him that the House itself had long 
been a source of mystery to the 
Saturnia police, and that they had 
been eagerly waiting for years for 
a pretext to break into it. They told 
him that the Inspector was com- 
pletely in the dark as to Hera’s 
reason for murdering her husband 
and equally in the dark as to Zeus 
IX’s reason for ordering Matthew

to put the capsule in orbit. They 
also told him that the Saturnia au- 
thorities knew nothing about the 
Hyperion-Bimini shuttle, and hence 
knew nothing whatsoever about the 
nature of the Bimini cargo. 

Neither did Old Matt North. And 
now that the Saturnia authorities 
were going to bring the capsule 
down themselves and launch an of- 
ficial investigation, he probably 
never would know. Unless — 

He paused on the wind-swept ice- 
flats. Deliberately, he finished the 
thought: Unless he brought it down 
himself. 

Well, why not? Who had a bet- 
ter right to bring it down than the 
man who had pushed it all the way 
to Bimini and all the way back 
again? Who, indeed! 

He began to run. Actually, it was 
more of a stepped-up shuffle than 
a run, but it was the best that he 
could do. 

He was gasping when he reached 
the port, but he did not stop, and 
minutes later he was in his jet- 
tractor, climbing, climbing, up the 
dark and breathless stairway of the 
night and into the great star-ceil- 
inged hall of space. He caught the 
capsule deftly, brought it down on 
a Harlequin-orbit of nights and 
days and dawns and set it on the 
lift-platform. He got out and 
climbed up on the platform and be- 
gan examining the meteor-pitted 
hull. Dawn had departed. Morning 
was airing the first dirty linen of 
the day above the warped back 
yard of the horizon when at last he 
found the hatch. 

Owing to the capsule’s present 


position, the metal plate was low on 
the hull, and this made opening it 
all the more difficult; but finally the 
final dog gave way before the ham- 
mer he had brought from the jet- 
tractor, and the plate fell free. He 
dug through the intervening layers 
of chemically-treated insulation to 
the inner hull, expecting to find an 
inner hatch. He did not find one — 
he found a valve instead. 

Wine? Had he been playing Bac- 
chus all these weary years? 

Well, he was at least entitled to 
a taste. 

The valve was a large one, and 
could be opened only with a wrench. 
He got a large one out of his jet- 
tractor and locked its jaws on the 
protruding valve-stem. He did not 
mean to turn the stem all the way, 
but the wrench gave him more lev- 
erage than he thought he had and 
far more than he actually needed, 
and before he knew what had hap- 
pened, a stream of ice-cold liquid 
had gushed forth and sent him tum- 
bling off the platform. 

He landed on his back and lay 
there dazed, the liquid pouring 
down on him and drenching him 
to the skin. Finally the coldness 
shocked him into consciousness and 
brought him gasping to his feet. 
Finding the wrench, he climbed 
back up on the platform and tried 
to close the valve. But in order to get 
a firm grip on the stem he had to 
move into the gushing stream, and 
again the force of it proved too much 
for him and once more he went 
tumbling to the ground. This time, 
the wrench struck him glancingly on 
the temple and knocked off his ear-

flapped cap. Blackness came then, 
and when at last it went away the 
stream had dwindled to a mere 
trickle, and the contents of the cap- 
sule were no more. 

H e sat up. All around him he 
heard the sound of liquid run- 
ning off and seeping into the in- 
numerable crevices in the ice. 
Clothes dripping, he floundered to 
his feet. He licked his wet lips, but 
he did not taste wine. 

Jack and Jill went up the hill to 
get a pail of water. 

Day spread more invisible 
clotheslines in the sky and hung out 
more dirty linen to dry. The wind 
grew sharper. Hatless, he started 
walking down the street in the wind. 

Something was happening in his 
bones. 

He could not get the nursery 
rhyme out of his mind. Jack and 
Jill went up the hill to get a pail 
of water . 

Faustina saw him from the Hos- 
tel, and came forth to meet him. 
“Are you all right, Mr. North?” 
“Yes, I’m all right,” said Old 
Matt North. Jack and Jill went up 
the hill to get a pail of water. 


“You’re wet. You’re cold. Let me 
help you to your room.” 

“Walk up the stairs before me — 
that will be help enough.” 

Faustina obeyed. He followed, 
drinking in the sweet and thrilling 
youth of her. Lord , to be young 
again ! he thought . and even as 
the thought went through his mind 
he felt strength flowing into his 
half-frozen legs and building up in 
his back and arms. He felt his shoul- 
ders straightening, Old Matt North 
did, and he felt himself growing 
taller, as one by one the weary fruit- 
less years slipped silently away. 

The wine from the stars was no 
human drink: It was that heady 
juice called — youth. 

No, Ponce de Leon never found 
his Bimini, but Nick the Greek 
found his. High up on the big black 
hill of time and space he found it, 
and the waters of it were good 
Young Matt North paused at the 
top of the stairs, and Faustina 
turned and faced him. The conster- 
nation in her eyes soon gave way to 
better things. Standing on the land- 
ing in the wind, he smiled at her. 
She smiled back.

GUARDIAN 

BY JEROME BIXBY 


They sought the Guardian 
who had defended ancient 
Mars — and destroyed it l 


hobos rose . 

The two men stood outside the 
Martian temple. Their faces were 
worried. 

“Let’s get going!” said Pym. His 
voice sounded distant in the thin, 
chill air of the red desert. “Now. 
The hell with getting more stuff to 
take back!” 

“One more load,” said Adams. His 
round face was nervous, but deter- 
mined. He turned and entered the 
high, shadowy, triangular door of 
the temple. Pym sighed and fol- 


lowed. They switched on their 
torches, revealing bleak stone walls 
around them. Echoes of their foot- 
steps were a constant murmur in 
the nearly circular confines. 

“If I was sure about it,” said 
Adams, “I’d be running. I’d probab- 
ly beat you back to the ship. But 
— I’m not sure . 

Pym flashed his light upward — 
held it steady on a pictograph. 
Then he moved the light onward to 
the next — and the next — 

The series of huge pictographs. 



seventeen in all, ran around the en- 
tire inner wall of the temple, about 
eight feet above the floor. They 
were deeply graven in the rusty 
sandstone. They were ugly. 

Pym shuddered. 

"I’m no expert,” he said, "and 
even / get the message.” 

"They certainly seem to be rep- 
resentational,” Adams agreed. "Nev- 
ertheless, they may be symbolic. 
That thing — the Guardian — may 
just be a god, a protective spirit, 
an imagined entity — ” 

"It’s a machine ,” Pym said, cer- 
tainty in his voice. "Look at it, for 
God’s sake! Why fight the 
obvious? ...” 

T heir flash-beams converged on 
the pictograph at two o’clock 
from the door — the one bearing 
the most detailed image of the thing 
which they had nervously christened 
The Guardian. 

"Apparently a dodecahedron,” 
Adams nodded. "Gigantic — if those 
are really spaceships it’s destroy- 
mg — 

"With round eyelets all over it,” 
Pym said harshly, "and rays com- 
ing out of the eyelets! And there 
— ” his flash-beam lowered a little 
— "those tiny figures spilling out of 
the ruptured ship . doesn’t that 
give you an idea of its size?” 
"Should it?” Adams said. "When 
we don’t know the size of anything 
else in that context? Maybe the 
Martians were an inch tall.” 

Pym flashed his light at the nine- 
foot-high doorway. His expression, 
in the reflected glow, said nuts. 
"All right,” Adams grinned. 


“There’s still no legal limit on the 
size of gods.” 

"It’s too sophisticated for that!” 
Pym said. He turned to irony: "Quite 
a primitive god-image! . .with eye- 
lets, and fanning death-rays, and 
mathematically symmetrical!” 

"I admit that it may well be a 
machine,” said Adams. "I simply re- 
fuse to conclude that it is. Or 
was.” He turned and commenced to 
gather up fragments of stone urns 
and plaques and other artifacts 
from the inches-thick dust, on the 
floor. He stowed them in the wide- 
mouthed sack hung on his belt. His 
light probed here and there. He 
fingered a shard of vase: "Okay... 
they were taller.” 

"Is? ... or was?” mused Pym. 
"What if it’s still around?” 

"Then, if our understanding of the 
pictographs is correct,” said Adams, 
"we have every reason to feel as 
nervous as we do.” He moved off 
through an inner doorway. His light 
flickered on the walls of a cham- 
ber beyond. 

“The Guardian,” said Pym, star- 
ing up at the multi-faceted thing 
portrayed in the two o’clock pic- 
tograph. "A machine. A robot . 
hellishly armed. Built to detect and 
destroy extra-Martians life forms.” 
He moved his light to another pic- 
tograph, in which the Guardian ap- 
parently was incinerating a multi- 
tude of scurrying tiny forms on a 
desert battle field. "Pve dreamed up 
a theory to cover that, Adams.” 
Adams laughed. "It’s your day 
for theories.” 

"Brainwaves,” Pym said. "A por- 
tion of the Guardian’s sensory ap-

paratus could be tuned to the alpha 
kappa of the Martian brain, with a 
signal generator in its recognition 
circuits that constantly produces the 
key pattern, matching it against all 
outside patterns received. If a pat- 
tern is picked up that doesn’t jitter 
right, a binary computation takes 
place whose answer is no — ” 
Adams appeared at the door. 
“Masterful! And then the Guardian 
tracks down and blasts hell out of 
the alien brain!” He picked up a 
piece of pottery, put it into the sack 
he was carrying and moved on in- 
to another chamber. 

“An interplanetary war,” Pym 
mused on, his light illuminating an- 
other pictograph. “When Mars was 
at the height of her civilization. She 
had forgotten war. Suddenly, with- 
out warning, the Invaders were up- 
on her. Half of Mars died in the 
first attack.” He paused thoughtful- 
ly: “Maybe the Invaders were from 
Planet X . the one that blew up 
to create the Asteroid Belt. If they 
knew what was due to happen, 
they’d sure as hell want leben - 
sraum ...” 

A dam’s cannonade of chuck- 
les echoed around the close, 
dark walls. # “Superb. What a talent 
for fiction!” 

“You,” said Adams coldly, “are an 
unimaginative God damned anthro- 
pologist. Remember Pictograph 
Two? The Invaders’ fleet is shown 
coming from the next outer plan- 
et—” 

“Jupiter,” came Adams’s voice. 
“Or the thing is meant to show a 
swarm of bugs, like locusts, coming 


out of the sun, like superstition, to 
ruin the crops. Or it could mean 
. God knows what it could 
mean!” He came out of the cham- 
ber and dumped his filled-up sack 
on the floor. He clipped another to 
his belt. “You’re a lazy bastard. Give 
me a hand. Stop taking my first 
assumptions as gospel. I should in- 
terpret the Martian mind in six 
hours? And, yes — ” he ’ paused, in 
his search for more artifacts — “I 
will admit that it appears to be a 
fleet coming from the next outer 
planet. Satisfied?” He moved off. 

“Lord, what I’d give to know!” 
Pym’s light slowly moved along the 
series of huge graven scenes: “Some 
scientists escaped, right? They 
formed Mars’s defensive core. 
While the Invaders pillaged the 
planet, the scientists worked. They 
turned the thing loose . and it — ” 
he swallowed, looking at Picto- 
graphs Nine through Fifteen — “it 
destroyed the Invaders. Utterly. It 
got all of them who had colonized 
the surface. It got the lookout ships, 
in orbit. It got all the lifecraft who 
tried to escape. In a day.” 

“Or a year, or a thousand years,” 
said Adams, his voice echoing from 
a corridor he was prowling. “Or it 
never happened at all.” His voice 
was amused. “Maybe the picto- 
graphs show what happened to the 
lousy bugs who came and threat- 
ened the crops. Some other bugs 
came along, big round ones, and 
they ate the baddies and saved the 
day!” 

“One big round faceted bug,” 
Pym said. “Just one. With rays com- 
ing out of — ”

Adams’s footsteps had faded. He 
couldn’t hear. 

Pym shivered in the chill of the 
temple. He looked out the door. 
The dark rolling dunes of Syrtis 
Major seemed flooded with a frosty 
fire; smooth shrouds of paper-thin 
ice made sparkling traceries of the 
ripples that marched down each 
slope into shadow. 

Off in the distance was the Mars 
/, like a toy, like a silver trophy, 
the cyclopean stare of its nose-port 
fixed on the cold-starred horizon. 

Pym wondered what he would do 
if a giant robot were suddenly to 
rear up hugely over that horizon, 
humming and clicking, a thousand 
eyelets searching, a thousand dead- 
ly ra^s ready to lash forth at him 
as the thing’s “mind” said kill .... 

Pym took his eyes from the tem- 
ple door — away from spectral im- 
aginings. 

“Too late,” he said to the picto- 
graphs. “The Guardian saved Mars 
too late. Ninety per cent of you 
were dead. You declined into sav- 
agery — wandering tribes, staring 
at the rubble of cities. The scien- 
tists died, and science with them. 
The centuries passed, and nothing 
was left of the greatness of Mars.” 
He flashed his light on the last tv/o 
pictographs: “Nothing except — the 
Guardian. You remembered it, all 
right. It was* your legendary savior. 
You deified it. You built this tem- 
ple to it, and probably many other 
temples. It was your god — but, by 
real God, your legends recalled it 
as a machine” 

“Bravo!” said Adams, at Pym’s 
shoulder, and he clapped gloved 


hands together in applause. “You’ve 
damn near got me convinced! Hap- 
pily, there are other theories.” He 
shoved the twisted necks of two 
chockful sacks into Pym’s hands. 
“All right, then. It appears that 
we’re in great danger. I’ll race you 
to the ship!” 

“Funny,” Pym grumbled. “Fun- 
ny.” He shouldered the sacks. “Is 
there anything we haven’t photo- 
graphed?” 

“You want to * wait . around,” ‘ 
Adams said in mock worry, “when 
the Guardian is on the warpath?” 

Pym called him a name and 
walked out the temple door. 

Adams followed after first 
flashing his light around for a look 
at the pictographs. And he wasn’t 
smiling. 

T hey trudged through the steep 
moonlit dunes toward the Mars 
/. It lay in the distance like a silver 
cigar between them and the hori- 
zon. 

“It might still be running around 
out on the desert somewhere,” Pym 
said. 

They were on the brink of a 
long slope, one which bore the 
slanting scars of their previous up- 
and-down passages. Adams started 
down, and the thin snap and crackle 
of ice made his reply unintelligible. 
Pym followed, balancing arms-out 
like a skier, digging in with the sides 
of his feet. They moved crabwise 
down and along the face of fine, 
crisp sand. 

“What?” Pym said loudly. 

Adams shook his head. He van- 
ished into the pool of inky shadow 


32 


IF 



at the base of the dune. A moment 
later, he reappeared, black against 
silver, on the up-slope of the next 
dune. He waited for Pym. 

Thirty feet behind them, twice 
that above them, the temple 
humped up out of the sand like a 
giant peaked cranium — dark, si- 
lent, against the red-and-black 
streaked sky. Its outer surface was 
graven with a twisting, sinuous or- 
namentation — an alien geometry. 

Pym plunged into shadow. The 
slope began to level invisibly be- 
neath his feet. He skipped, got sort 
of a jumping run under him, came 
to a stop beside Adams. “What?” he 
asked again. 

“You’ve got me terrified,” Adams 
grinned. 

Pym looked closely at the round- 
faced man. “By God,” he said, “I 
have, haven’t I? Wipe that smile 
and don’t kid me!” 

Adams nudged stiff sand with his 
foot, watched it skitter and tumble 
down into the shadow between the 
dunes. He raised his eyes to the 
temple. “Everything you said,” he 
said, “fits my preferred interpreta- 
tion of the pictographs. I hate to 
admit it. Let’s go.” 

“It could still be alive,” Pym said. 

“A machine doesn’t live,” Adams 
said. “It doesn’t die. There may 
once have been a machine. It may 
be rust in the sands — and it may 
be targeting us. We may be crazy. 
Let’s go.” 

They labored upward, crunching 
icy sand. 

Behind them was the temple. 

Above them was Phobos. Pym 
studied it through half-closed eyes. 


A few tiny craters were visible 
along its twilight boundary, and it 
gave back a faint rust hue which 
faded visibly as the little moon cir- 
cled further toward nightside. Soon 
Mars’s other moon, Deimos, would 
bullet up over the horizon, to race 
the stars for mastery of the night. 

The men moved on toward their 
ship, in the silver light of Phobos, 
whose name meant Fear. 

They topped a long rise. Before 
them stretched a vast level area of 
sand. And stretching off into the 
night were the deep tracks left by 
the Mars Fs great wheels in land- 
ing. Three feet down into the sand. 
Thirty feet apart. A mile long, and 
straight as a ruler over the dark- 
ened face of Syrtis Major. Such was 
the mark of the first Earth ship to 
reach Mars, eleven hours ago. 

T he men struggled on through the 
ruddy sand. 

Was there somewhere a giant ro- 
bot, grim and cold, watching over 
this dead world, waiting patiently 
for sign of alien brains to be des- 
troyed at the whispered bidding of 
its ancient builders? 

For how many centuries had that 
been a futile search? 

And now — not futile. 

— wandering the red deserts, 
giant treads bruising sand and polar 
ice and the criss-crossed mud of 
canal bottoms ages dry — nosing 
alertly, testing air, ground, radia- 
tion — a steel bloodhound, a racing 
silver tower, a deadly behemoth; 
soundless, perhaps, save for tha 
whisper of steel on oiled steel, the 
clicks of relays. 


GUARDIAN 



How huge? How powerful? Per- 
haps it would blot out the sky. Now 
it was sniffing toward them, some- 
where out over the sands, coming 
faster than the wind and more si- 
lent. The whine of rising power, a 
million lights blinking directions in- 
to photo-cells, dispensary circuits 
humming, eyelets searching, prob- 
ing, pinpointing, while little robot 
repair-machines waited in niches to 
swarm out at first sign of damage 
or wear .... 

Did it have a brain? Could it 
think? Could it tell that Earthmen 
were not enemies? Or weren’t they? 
To ancient, peaceful, quiet Mars, 
would they have come as friends?. 

“I was right l” gasped Adams, as 
they plunged down a slope. “You’re 
right. Fm scared! It’s clear as hell, 
now! . .” 

“What?” yelled Pym, over the 
crackling of paper-ice. They 
reached bottom. 

“What else could the pictographs 
mean?” Adams moaned. 

“Bugs,” said Pym sardonically. 

They started up the next slope . 

Above them loomed the robot. 

^p'hey squalled and flopped flat 
on the slope of the sand-dune, 
and they dragged out their repeat- 
ing-pistols, and they fired explosive 
pellets galore. 

The ‘ night flickered, roared, 
flared, shook, and thundered with 
blue explosions. Fantastic shadows 
were created on the rippled sides 
of dunes. Thin ice turned to steam 
and rose in boiling clouds. Sand- 
particles rattled and danced as con- 
cussions slammed about. 


The Robot stared down at them, 
stiffly motionless. 

“Its head!” Pym shrieked. “Look 
at it! It’s the Guardian!” 

They concentrated their fire on 
the silent, huge, multi-faceted head 
of the robot. It seemed to regard 
them patiently. Their guns howled 
at it, at the rate of ten limited fusion 
blasts per second per gun. 

The head came off. 

It wobbled off its boiling metal 
neck, struck a brawny metal shoul- 
der, bounced and flicked molten 
droplets all around and thudded 
heavily to the sand at the top of 
the dune. It rolled over once — 
rolled again — and then was st : ” 
The sand beneath it snapped, as 
icon rebelled at infernal heat. Red 
glow faded in the darkness. 

The rest of the robot still stood — 
headless. It had not once moved, 
not at all. 

The men gasped, stared upward, 
wheezed, and finally recovered their 
breaths. 

Pym sat up. He bolstered his 
gun. He got to his feet. Boldly, ho 
trudged up the slope until he stood 
before the silent robot. 

He kicked its ankle, and cried 
jubilantly, “So much for the god- 
dam. lousy Guardian!” 

He put his foot on the face of 
the detached, fallen head and 
struck a pose as Adams joined 
him. 

Adams was frowning. 

He passed Pym, and inspected 
joints in the robot’s great body. 

“This thing,” he said, “hasn’t 
moved for a thousand years! It’s 
rusted solid. It’s been dead for God 


34 


IF 



knows how long.” He shook his head, 
smiling at Pym’s heroic stance. “We 
had nothing to fear from it . it’s 
an absolute wreck!” 

“Then,” repeated Pym in satisfac- 
tion, “so much for the goddam 
Guardian!” 

“Look at it,” said Adams quietly. 

“Huh?” said Pym. 

“It wasn’t built for speed,” said 
Adams. “It wasn’t built to fly. Ob- 
viously, it wasn’t built to withstand 
attack . and I’m sure the Invad- 
ers were better armed than we are. 
I wonder if it was even built to 
last .” He put a hand on the thing’s 
great, cold, quiet right arm: “It’s a 
worker.” 

Pym stared. 

Adams slapped the crude right 
“hand” of the Robot. “Do you know 
design? It’s a digger — a miner — 


a rooter — a sand-hog. Maybe it’s 
a searcher-for- water.” He shook his 
head: “It’s not something created by 
Martian scientists to kill a million 
aliens . .” 

“It came for us,” said Pym. 

“We came to i7,” said Adams. He' 
motioned at the surrounding dunes. 
“We’ve wandered afield in our up- 
set state. Have we taken this route 
before? No, I think we’re a dune 
or two off the beaten track . 

“So much,” said Pym hopefully, 
“for the Guardian.” 

“And good luck to us,” whispered 
Adams. 

They started for their ship again. 

They almost made it. 

D eimos rose . and paused in its 
orbit . and remembered.

F • Short Story 


ALMOST EDEN 

BY JO FRIDAY 

4 


it was bad luck to name a 
planet "Eden 11 — but these 
men weren't superstitious I 


S enior Biologist Johnston looked 
about him with a reluctant 
approval : the shuttle system from 
the spacecraft was efficiently or- 
ganized, clean and swift. True, 
the Service man was leaning negli- 
gently against the bulkhead, whis- 
tling the latest Service-sponsored fa- 
vorite. But no one ever expected 
full respect from a Service man. 
Service men were ambitionless, rest- 
less louts with an inborn rebellion 
against law, whether man-made or 
natural. Most were bright, many 
were brilliant, but all had an im- 
pressive list of campus expulsions. 
Before the Exploration Drive exist- 
ed these men were drifting delin- 
quents, whether outcasts of the so- 


ciety or members of some rough 
army. Senior Biologist Johnston’s 
nose was superior but tolerant. This 
Service man’s behavior might be in- 
sulting, but at least the man looked 
well — tanned and healthy. Per- 
haps this was an A grade planet 
after all. 

The Group leader was waiting on 
the edge of the shuttle tarmac. Sen- 
ior Biologist Johnston’s sense of ap- 
proval grew as the man greeted 
him deferentially, making all the 
seemly gestures. 

“Your name?” asked Johnston on 
a tolerant note. 

“Garfield, Senior Biologist,” the 
Group leader said, with a bow of 
his head. He was a tall man, and 


36 


well built, though not as heavy as 
Service men tended to be, and al- 
most improperly young. But he was 
remarkable. Johnston had fully ex- 
pected this. To be a leader of a 
group of Service men, a man had 
to be remarkable. 

“Very good, Garfield,” Johnston 
said graciously, but as he cast a 
rapid assessing glance over the com- 
pound, his sense of approval less- 
ened. The minimum time of explor- 
ation before a Senior could be 
called was six M. T. months. Con- 
sidering this length of time, very 
few buildings had been erected. 
Johnston, no mincer of words, said 
so. “Is this all you have built?” he 
barked. 

Garfield waved an apologetic 
arm around the green and blue vis- 
ta. “Sir,” he said earnestly, “this is 
an A grade planet. No rain falls, 
so you can imagine how hard it is 
to get the men to build shelters.” 

“No rain?” Johnston peered down 
at the rich brown earth and luxur- 
iant dark-green growth. 

“No rain,” Garfield said simply. 
“But the place is riddled with under- 
ground springs. Most probably 
they’re fed with the snow from the 
ranges.” 

Johnston allowed his gaze to 
wander up into the distance, to 
where the stately white crags of 
mountains reared jutting from 
mounded green slopes. “Wind?” he 
asked, into the clear still air. 

“No wind.” 

“Hum.” The Senior Biologist 
chewed this notion over for a while, 
and then allowed a faint rebuke to 
enter his tone. “Most interesting — 


you should have sent for a Senior 
Meteorologist.” 

“The biology of the area is most 
interesting,” Garfield murmured 
diplomatically, and waited. 

“You know something about bi- 
ology?” 

“I specialized in it at the Service 
Center.” 

Johnston stared at Garfield for 
a full moment, and then joined in 
the young man’s grin. “And you 
wanted a few little theories tested? 
Humph!” 

Garfield’s grin grew wider, and 
the two men began to pace slowly 
towards the compound. “We’ve set 
up a Service-specified laboratory,” 
he ventured. 

“Good, good.” Senior Biologist 
Johnston stopped a moment, 
stretching his venerable bones and 
crinkling his eyes in the crystal air 
and bright warm sunlight. When he 
stepped off again his stride had be- 
come springier. “I admit I can un- 
derstand why you found it difficult 
to get the men to build shelters,” 
he said, a sharp twinkle in his eye. 

An amicable relationship had 
been cemented. 

“This is definitely an A-grade 
planet,” Garfield said, following 
Johnston into the laboratory. “It 
betters all the Service specifications. 
In fact — ” he hesitated — “we 
would have called it ‘Eden’, but . .” 

“Yes, yes, I know,” Senior Biolo- 
gist Johnston agreed. “Every plan- 
et they’ve named Eden has had its 
snake, indeed. A fatal flaw.” 

“Most Edens have eventually been 
found unfit for human settlement,” 
Garfield said earnestly. “And, some- 


ALMOST EDEN 


37 



how, we just didn’t want to take 
the risk.” 

“I see, I see,” Johnston said, smil- 
ing. “And I presume no fatal flaws 
have cropped up yet. What about 
predators? Carnivores?” 

“There’s only one true carni- 
vore,” Garfield said slowly. “The 
Bighead — that’s what we call it, at 
any rate. You’ll see what I mean: 
the animal has the biggest head I’ve 
ever seen. All muscles and teeth/ 

J ohnson frowned. “Only one car- 
nivore?” 

“Yes.” Garfield pulled up a chair 
for the Senior Biologist and strad- 
dled another, his tanned young face 
enthusiastic. “Let me give you the 
picture,” he said. “The vegetation 
round here — I suppose you no- 
ticed. It’s incredibly luxuriant. Very 
fast growing, and completely her- 
baceous. Yes,” he said to Johnston’s 
startled expression. “No secondary 
thickening at all.” 

Silently, disbelievingly, Johnston 
pushed aside his chair and went to 
the window. There was a long si- 
lence as he stood with his back to 
the room, and then when he spoke 
his voice was hushed. “No trees. Not 
a tree anywhere.” 

“That’s right, sir,” Garfield said. 
“But when you think about it, it’s 
logical. No wind, no rain, a tem- 
perate climate with no extremes of 
heat or cold — no shelter needed.” 
“But light.” Johnston turned, red 
cheeks aglow, an excited hand pull- 
ing at his dandy little white beard. 
“There must be competition for 
light. This is most interesting.” 
“Yes.” Garfield bent forward. 


“You see, this sort of environment 
favors one particular type of ani- 
mal.” 

“The ruminant,” Johnston said, 
his voice hushed. “Yes? Yes?” 

“Yes,” Garfield said triumphant- 
ly. “Herbivorous animals — mil- 
lions of them, and the variation! 
You’ve no idea. And fast! There’s 
one rather like a horse that Pd like 
to cart back to Signis III. Put it in 
a few races, and I could sit back in 
luxury for the rest of my days.” 

“And these animals have only 
one enemy?” 

“That’s right. The Bighead. One 
of my lieutenants — Parr — is an 
amateur paleontologist, though, and 
he got interested in the fossils round 
here. Plenty of them, too, all in ex- 
cellent condition. And there’s plen- 
ty of different types of carnivores.” 
Garfield gestured towards a large 
number of ancient bones, all neatly 
laid out on the bench behind him. 
Excitedly Johnston poked around 
them, weighing skulls in his hand 
and testing sharp teeth. 

“Interesting, interesting,” he mut- 
tered, aligning limb bones. “It looks 
as if they were fast,” he said crit- 
ically. 

“But not fast enough,” Garfield 
interrupted. “You’ve no idea — you 
must see these herbivores.” 

“Hum,” the Senior Biologist said 
thoughtfully. “So these carnivores 
became extinct, eh?” 

“Except for the Bighead,” Gar- 
field said, following Johnston to the 
door. “They — 

Johnston had stopped so abrupt- 
ly that Garfield crashed into him. 
“Sorry, sir!” Garfield began to laugh

IF 



but then his eyes followed the line 
of Johnston’s rigid gaze, and his 
humor died a nervous death. 
Tempting brown bodies played in 
the distant sun. 

“What — is — this?” The words 
were terrible, threateningly spaced. 

arfield coughed. “They’re wom- 
en, sir.” 

“Women!” 

“Uh, yes, sir. They came out of 
the hills six weeks ago.” 

“Six weeks! And have you in- 
formed Central?” 

Garfield coughed again, and the 
Senior Biologist turned a frosty eye 
on him. “No?” he barked. “Why 
not?” 

“Uh, I knew you were coming, 
sir, and I thought that — ” 

“You thought! And tell me, young 
man, is it in your orders to think?” 
“No, sir,” said Garfield miser- 
ably. 

“Humph! Well, I’d better have a 
look at these — these women .” The 
word was incredibly scornful, but 
Garfield, hurrying after Johnston’s 
stumping form, .could not see why. 
The women were not beautiful, but 
that aura — Maybe their faces were 
flattened and featureless, but those 
silky clouds of hair, so caressing 
. Maybfe their bodies were soft 
and blurred, but those delicious 
curves .... And maybe the women 
were certifiable imbeciles, but that 
animal magnetism .... 

“They are attractive,” the Senior 
Biologist said strangely, peering at 
the poised, aware bodies. 

“Attractive” was hardly the word 
for the jellifying effect that these 


bodies had on men. “They’d put the 
Visagram girls out of business,” 
Garfield allowed. “It’s a quality that 
manufacturers of perfume have 
been trying to sell for centuries. 
You see what I mean?” 

Johnston, thoughtfully stroking 
his beard, turned an alert eye on 
him. “I’m an old man, Garfield,” he 
said, twinkling. 

Garfield grinned. Evidently he 
was forgiven. “They’re stupid, of 
course,” he said. 

“Language?” 

Garfield shook his head. “A cer- 
tain range of noises,” he said, “and 
a limited number of facial expres- 
sion. One of them is slightly more 
intelligent — I’ve trained her to do 
a little housework.” He raised his 
voice. “Tania! Tania!” One of them 
looked up and glided smoothly over, 
with rich movements of her buttery 
body. “Remarkably humanoid, eh?” 
said Garfield, a master’s pride in 
his voice. “I’ve called her Tania.” 

“So I noticed,” Johnston said dry- 
ly. He began to amble away, bend- 
ing over every now and then to 
poke around in the vegetation, but 
then stopped and looked back as 
the women began to raise them- 
selves and point, crying out with 
hoarse, excited voices. A brown 
herd blurred across the plain in the 
flick of an eye. 

“They’re fast!” the Senior Biolo- 
gist exclaimed in tremendous sur- 
prise. Then he saw that one shape, 
one brown segment of the herd, 
was dragged back, slowing, separ- 
ated from its fellows. It lunged, 
straining forward, heaving in distant 
fright 



ALMOST EDEN

“Aw — ah! Aw — ah!” the wom- 
en began to cry in chorus, leaping 
up and down. Johnston began to 
run toward that distant struggling 
shape, pulling at his beard with an 
excited hand and cursing his old 
heart. A purring disturbance of the 
air, and Garfield materialized 
alongside in a zoomer, shouting. 
Johnston thankfully climbed up be- 
side him. 

“It’s a Bighead,” Garfield shout- 
ed. He slammed the zoomer into 
slow motion, so that they could ap- 
proach the struggle without dis- 
turbing the Bighead. Johnston had 
a momentary vision of the herbi- 
vore hauled down on its hindquar- 
ters, raising its long thin nose to the 
sky in a high-pitched violin scream 
as they flickered over the vegeta- 
tion, and then they materialized be- 
side the fight. The Bighead raised 
a huge, blood-dripping skull and 
reared back in sneering fright. And 
then it disappeared. Ran right off 
the horizon before the mind had 
registered that it existed. It had six 
legs. 

4 C TV yT y God, it’s fast,” Johnston 

-LVA said reverently. 

“The fastest thing on this planet.” 
Garfield signed to the zoomer to 
stow the body of the slaughtered 
herbivore, and then kicked it into 
the homeward route. 

“Faster than all the herbivores?” 
Johnston asked as they materialized 
on the compound. 

“Yes. And it kills them whole- 
sale.' From most of them it doesn’t 
eat a mouthful, even. It seems to 
be activated by a lust for massacre. 


That’s how we get our meat,” Gar- 
field said apologetically, and John- 
ston looked back to see that the 
zoomer had left the carcass in the 
cookhouse yard. “It’s perfectly 
healthy, really — and we wouldn’t 
have a hope of catching any of 
those herbivores.” 

“Quite so, quite so,” said John- 
ston thoughtfully. “The Bigheads kill 
a lot of animals?” 

“Yes. Hundreds. The only reason 
the herbivores aren’t wiped out is 
that there are millions of herbivores 
and very few Bigheads.” 

“Then what happens to the car- 
casses?” 

Garfield stared at him. 

“There aren’t any birds,” John- 
ston pointed out. “And no other 
carnivores.” 

“Well,” said Garfield slowly, “I 
suppose the Amoebans get rid of 
them.” 

“What?” 

Garfield grinned. “Come and 
see.” 

They climbed down from the 
zoomer and walked over to the 
cookhouse yard, pausing at the 
fence. The cook was standing on 
the step, berating a large jelly that 
was extending a sly pseudopod to- 
ward the carcass of the herbivore. 
The pseudopod guiltily retreated. 

“Hi,” said the cook when he saw 
them. “Titus is getting greedy,” he 
said, in excuse for the jelly. He 
called to someone inside, and anoth- 
er man came out with a bucket of 
offal and bones, which he emptied 
onto the ground beside the Amoe- 
ban, talking to it as he did so. Titus 
slid rapidly on top of the pile, and 


40 


IF 



settled down with a contented 
squish. 

44 And keep off our good meat,” 
said the cook, shaking an admon- 
itory fist. With frequent and pater- 
nal backward looks the two men 
disappeared inside. 

“See?” said Garfield. 

“I thought you told me that there 
was only one carnivore,” Johnston 
said severely. 

“Oh, come now,” Garfield object- 
ed. 44 You can’t call an Amoeban a 
nasty word like that — can we, Ti- 
tus?” He walked over to the crea- 
ture and poked a doting finger into 
its protoplasm. It squiggled. 

44 ‘Amoeban* is not a bad title,” 
Johnston observed. “It’s very amoe- 
boid.” 

“A much higher level of intelli- 
gence, of course,” Garfield said. 

The Senior Biologist grinned. 
“Enough to inspire extreme and un- 
warranted affection from otherwise 
rational men.” 

H e bent over the creature, study- 
ing it. It appeared to be 
typically amoeboid, if gigantic, dis- 
tinguished only by its peculiar diet. 

The bones and offal were being 
rapidly absorbed. As Johnston 
watched they were completely sur- 
rounded by the jelly of the crea- 
ture’s body. Then he began to 
stroke his beard with a puzzled ges- 
ture. Vacuoles were forming round 
the food, widening and expanding 
as digestive juices were secreted, be- 
coming large bubbles of fluid — 
and the food, even the bone-matter, 
was dissolving. In five minutes all 
trace of the food was gone, and 


all that was left were the bubbles 
of yellowish fluid. 

“Fast,” said Johnston thoughtful- 
ly- 

“Titus? Why, he’s as slow as a 
Service man after a night on Mars. 
Oh,” said Garfield, “the digestion. 
I see what you mean. He’ll eat as 
much as you’ll give him, too — and 
he gets plenty. I’ve, seen him at 
night twice his usual size with the 
big vacuole full of digested food in- 
side him, but by morning it’s all 
gone.” 

“All?” said Johnston thoughtfully. 

“All.” 

From then on Johnston showed 
an unnatural interest in Titus, being 
found most times sitting on the 
ground beside the creature, even in 
the dark of the evening — an un- 
natural interest, because there was 
so much else to occupy him. Why, 
he didn’t even bother to study the 
women, although they were the 
cause of his second argument with 
Garfield. 

“Garfield!” he shouted one day, 
bursting into the laboratory. “Gar- 
field!” 

“Yes?” Garfield inquired mildly, 
looking up from a microscope. “Has 
Titus run amuck?” 

“Garfield! Did you know your 
men are — are cohabiting with 
those women?” 

Garfield flushed. “Yes,” he said 
quietly. 

“And what is the meaning of al- 
lowing them to do such a thing?” 

“It seemed harmless,” Garfield 
murmured. 

Johnston’s shout set the micro- 
scope swinging on its mounting. 


ALMOST EDEN

“Harmless! And intermarriage of 
humans and Venusians has only 
been allowed fifty years!” 

Garfield’s eyes were steady. “Try 
and understand,” he said. “My men 
are not angels — very far from it. 
The last planet we explored was like 
most of them — a livid hell. So 
when they get an A grade planet 
I allow them to take full advantage 
of it. Full advantage,” he repeated 
for emphasis. 

“Oh, my God,” said Johnston, 
and sank limply onto a stool. “Do 
you realize that three of those wom- 
en are pregnant?” he demanded. 

“Yes.” Garfield’s eyes flickered a 
moment. “I must admit it was a 
shock,” he said. “I hadn’t expected 
that conception could take place — 
they’re so obviously a different 
species.” He was silent a moment, 
and then his next words were very 
quiet. “Tania is pregnant too.” 

I t took a moment for the signifi- 
cance of this to occur to John- 
ston, but when it did he groaned. 
“Oh, my boy, not you too? Didn’t 
you know that relations with a hu- 
manoid species is forbidden until a 
full series of tests is carried out?” 
“I realize that,” Garfield said 
calmly. “But as I see it the worst 
risk is that the — offspring — will 
be as imbecile as the mothers. There 
is also the possibility that our intel- 
ligence will be combined with their 
peculiar attractiveness. In any case, 
I take full responsibility for the 
whole business.” He turned back to 
the microscope in dismissal, but the 
S-n ; or Biologist remained on his 
stool. 


“I shall notify Central,” he said 
heavily. 

There was a long silence, and 
then Garfield turned back to the 
Senior Biologist — not to continje 
the argument, but to discuss his 
latest finding. “Very interesting,” he 
said, waving a hand at the micro- 
scope. “Parr has been poking round 
the hills after fossils, and he found 
a series of caves, all with a peculiar 
brown vegetation growing on the 
floor. Look.” He snapped a switch 
on the side of the microscope, and 
an image flicked onto the screen. 
It was a foliose organism, a dark 
reddish brown — about the color of 
liver — and, judging by the scale at 
the side of the image, about three 
feet high. It was lichen-like, crisp 
and shiny, and abundantly and di- 
chotomously branched. Garfield ad- 
justed the coarse focus, and the 
image distended rapidly until indi- 
vidual cells could be seen. 

It was definitely animal. The cells 
were round, blurred and without 
cel! walls. 

“Interesting,” said Johnston, star- 
ing and stroking his beard. “I’ve 
never come across anything like 
that before.” 

“I’ve been analyzing it,” Garfield 
said, his eyes alight with discovery. 
“Very strange. The outer boundary 
of each cell is protoplasm, all right, 
but the interior is either glycogen 
or a peculiar jellified amino acid.” 

Johnston’s frown was tremen- 
dous. “Stored protein?” he muttered. 
“In a digested form?” The idea was 
so puzzling that his eyebrows 
climbed up and down rapidly, like 
fluffy white caterpillars unsure

IP 



whether to be star* 1 2d or tremen- 
dously thoughtful. 

Garfield and Johnston discussed 
this engrossing subject for a while, 
wondering about the mode of life of 
such an animal, but were able to 
make nothing more of it. And one 
night a week later something hap- 
pened that put the problem right 
out of their minds. Johnston caught 
a Bighead. 

H e was crouched by Titus, study- 
ing him with the aid of a light, 
as it was much later than usual, and 
quite dark. Behind him was the re- 
ticulated wire fence, and suddenly, 
shockingly, this crashed and col- 
lapsed under a tremendous on- 
slaught. 

The Senior Biologist had had no 
warning at all. Not a single sound 
had reached his ears. One moment 
he was peacefully communing with 
Titus — and the next, out of a 
clear black sky, he was presented 
with a Bighead, howling slathering 
into his face, with two of its great 
fangs entangled in the wire. The 
Senior Biologist could have for- 
given his old heart if it had quietly 
given up the job then and there, but 
instead it thumped erratically on; 
and he ran into the kitchen and 
fetched a longhandled knife and 
killed the Bighead. 

It was a tremendous event. With- 
in minutes the whole Group was 
crowded around him, creating bed- 
lam and staring at this legendary 
animal. 

The head was huge, fully a third 
the size of the body. The eyes were 
frontal, like a man’s, so that vision 


was telescopic and three-dimension- 
al, and the slit-shaped pupils were 
distended within a red rim of iris. 
The body was lean and very mus- 
cular, with great driving pistons of 
middle and hind legs. The front legs 
were evidently manipulatory, for 
they were held up on either side of 
the head like the palps of a spider, 
and they were curved, and armed 
with huge tearing claws. Johnston 
noted this much in a single glance, 
and then, tearing at his beard with 
a wildly excited, blood-spattered 
hand, he ordered that the body be 
carried into the laboratory. This 
was done, and he locked himself in- 
side. 

He remained there three days, 
admitting no one, not even Garfield, 
and opening the door only for trays 
at mealtimes. 

On the morning of the fourth 
day he called for Garfield. The 
Group leader hurried inside, ex- 
pecting to be told of great discov- 
eries, but Johnston merely waved 
him over to the dissection bench, 
where the fully opened animal lay 
under the preservative lights — and 
then left the laboratory and went 
to bed. 

When the Senior Biologist re- 
turned in the late evening, with a 
refreshed look in his eye, and his 
beard washed, dried, brushed and 
dandy again, it was a thoroughly 
puzzled Group leader who met him. 

“Is it all there?” Garfield asked. 

Johnston nodded. “So you found 
the discrepancies?” he said, pedan- 
tic with an inner excitement. 

“Yes. But I don’t understand — 
don’t understand!”

Johnston twinkled. “Get the 
zoomer and come over to the cook- 
house yard,” he said. “Quickly. I’ll 
answer questions later.” 

When Garfield arrived with the 
zoomer Johnston was in his habit- 
ual position, crouched comfortably 
on the ground beside Titus. He 
looked up and waved, and then 
climbed up beside Garfield. 

“Don’t laugh,” he said. “But Titus 
is going to move soon — and fast. 
Set the controls to follow him.” 
Garfield did so, and then both 
men sat back in silence, staring 
down at the slight gleam of the 
amoeban, each occupied with his 
thoughts: Garfield gropingly, trying 
to understand, and Johnston con- 
centratedly, going over each facet 
of his theory again and again. They 
waited an hour, and in all that time 
Garfield spoke once, helplessly. 

“But how could it live? How can 
an animal live without a digestive 
system?” 

Finally the zoomer gave a queer 
little shudder, disorientated, and 
Garfield looked down to see Titus 
extending tentative pseudopodia in 
all directions. Finally the right one 
was found, and the amoeban slith- 
ered into one long groping trickle. 
It seemed to gather itself, faintly 
gleaming — and then, shockingly, 
the zoomer screamed into over- 
drive, and the Amoeban was a sil- 
very flash streaking across the plain. 

T he zoomer growled, flickering 

after Titus into the hills, but 
was hopelessly outpaced. When it 
materialized the Amoeban had been 
at its destination many microsec- 


onds, and now it was in its usual 
sluggish form, lying jelly-limp out- 
side a cave. Garfield neutralized the 
zoomer, and it hovered motionless 
above the Amoeban. He then 
looked inquiringly at Johnston, but 
the Senior Biologist gestured to him 
to remain still and silent. 

For a long series of minutes it 
seemed as if nothing was happening, 
but then a faint flick of movement 
caught Garfield’s eye. And into the 
phosphorescent glow cast by the 
zoomer jerked one of Parr’s “plants” 
— the liver-brown foliose animal. 
With painful slowness it moved, 
jerking in little hops and leaps to- 
wards the Amoeban. Then, several 
laborious moments later, it was lean- 
ing against a pseudopod, and with 
a final little hop it flicked onto the 
taut membrane. 

“A parasite?” Garfield whispered. 

“Hush.” The protoplasm of the 
amoeban was beginning to slither 
wetly, so that the foliose animal on 
its back was carried further into the 
center. Then abruptly, the shimmer- 
ing flowing stopped. The foliose 
animal was directly above the huge 
vacuole of yellowish digested food. 

Again the scene was suspended, 
and it looked as if nothing was hap- 
pening — but the foliose animal 
was slowly, imperceptibly swelling, 
and the vacuole was equally slow- 
ly contracting. 

Barely had Garfield registered 
this than the protoplasm of the 
Amoeban began to flow again. A 
long pseudopod formed, and Titus 
slithered sluggishly into the cave, 
still bearing the foliose animal on 
his back.

IF 



“Now,” said Johnston, “I shall tell 
you my theory.” 

“Shouldn’t we go in there?” Gar- 
field suggested. 

The Senior Biologist regarded 
him with a sharp eye. “It’s unneces- 
sary,” he said. “I’ve seen it before.” 

Garfield relaxed, frowning into 
the green glow of the controls. 

“You have told me,” Johnston be- 
gan, “that originally there were 
many carnivore species, but they all 
failed to adapt to the tremendous 
speed which the herbivores could 
attain. All except one — the Big- 
head. 

“In that cave, young man, the fo- 
liose animal is finishing its meal, 
extracting all the digested food from 
the Amoeban. Then, as you noticed, 
it will store this food, producing 
branches in which to keep all the 
glycogens and jellified amino acids. 
Then along will come — yes, 
look — ” 

There was a brown flash across 
the glow of the zoomer, zipping 
into the cave. 

“ — a Bighead. This Bighead will 
eat the branches of the foliose ani- 
mal. For this is how the Bighead 
adapted. 

“One day,” said the Senior Biolo- 
gist lazily, long fingers gentle and 
reflective on his beard, “I shall 
make a study of how much the pos- 
session of a digestive system slows 
the organism down. At the mo- 
ment all we know is that in times 
of emergency, when the body must 
reach its highest peak, the diges- 
tive system is shut down. In order 
for the body to reach top speed all 
digestion must stop. And to that 


common piece of knowledge I can 
add another — that in order to be- 
come faster than the herbivores, the 
Bighead had to discard its digestive 
system. And how did it do that?” 

“How?” Garfield’s voice was a 
whisper. 

“By some means — I suspect a 
mutation — it split into a number 
of animals.” 

«w hat! ” 

* * “Yes, yes,” said Johnston in- 
dulgently. “I know: it doesn’t make 
sense. At first I refused that theory, 
too, and considered that this was 
a complex example of symbiotic re- 
lationship. But now I know that the 
Bighead, the Amoeban and the fo- 
liose animal are all one creature. 
It’s just division of labor carried to 
an extreme. The Bighead is the ob- 
tainer of food, the jaws and mus- 
cles of the creature. It has the 
speed, given, as you saw, by tre- 
mendous muscles and bone struc- 
ture, and huge lungs and heart. And 
its function is to catch and kill 
the prey, leaving the carcass for 
the next part of the creature to 
deal with. 

“The Amoeban is the stomach — 
the digestive system. Its job is to ab- 
sorb and digest the carcass, collect- 
ing the digested food in a vacuole 
for the next part of the creature. 

“And, of course, the foliose ani- 
mal has the function of storing the 
food. So that when the Bighead 
eats its branches, it gets predigest- 
ed food in an assimilable form.” 
Johnston finished abruptly, turnir^g 
a smug gaze on Garfield for ad- 
miration.

“Amazing!” 

“Yes,” Johnston allowed. 

There was a long silence. 

“But how are you going to prove 
it?” 

“Prove it!” The Senior Biologist 
was flabbergasted. 

(“Yes. Prove that it is all one ani- 
mal, and not a symbiotic relation- 
ship.”^ 

T he Senior Biologist laid care- 
ful fingers across his beard. 
“That will be difficult ... It depends 
on what stage the animal splits — 
if I could see a foetus . .” John- 
ston sat bolt upright. “A foetus!” 
Garfield stared at him, with the 
same stunning thought. “The repro- 
ductive system,” he stuttered. “The 
Bighead didn’t have a reproductive 
system.” 


The fingers in Johnston’s beard 
were agitated now. “The reproduc- 
tive system Maybe the hor- 

mones slow the system down . 
but which part of the animal has 
the reproductive function?” 

Garfield’s voice was hushed. 
“Maybe none of them have. Maybe 
there’s another animal — one we 
haven’t seen yet — the one that has 
the reproductive function — ” 

The men stared at each other, 
and then down at the cave, wildly 
trying to imagine what weird, bud- 
ding, fissioning creature could be 
the reproductive phase of the crea- 
ture. And as they watched, there 
was movement in the mouth of the 
cave, and a smooth form appeared, 
richly pregnant with new life. 

Tania came out of the cave.

A Relief Story

ILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAN 


Retief feared neither man nor 
alien . • . though sometimes he 
couldn't tell which was which! 


I 

C onsul-General Magnan clutched 
his baggy chartreuse velvet 
beret against the blast of air from 
the rotor of the waiting heli and 
beckoned Retief closer. 


“I’ll be candid with you, Retief,” 
he said from the side of his mouth. 
“I’m not at all happy about leaving 
you here as deputy chief under a 
Groaci superior. The combination 
of unpredictable elements is an open 
invitation to disaster.” 


47 


“I’ve never known disaster to 
wait for an invitation, where our 
Groaci colleagues were concerned,” 
Retief commented. 

“Naturalizing a Groaci was irreg- 
ular enough in itself,” Magnan went 
on. “Tendering him an appointment 
in the Corps smacks of folly.” 

“Don’t underestimate the boys at 
headquarters,” Retief said cheerful- 
ly. “Maybe this is just the first step 
in a shrewd scheme to take over 
Groac.” 

“Nonsense! No one at HQ would 
want to go on record as favoring 
such a policy ...” Magnan looked 
thoughtful. “Besides, what does 
Groac have that we need?” 

“Their cast-iron gall would be a 
valuable acquisition — but I’m af- 
raid that’s the sort of intangible that 
will elude the wiliest diplomacy.” 
Magnan pursed his lips. “Take 
care, Retief. If anything goes awry, 
I’ll hold you fully responsible.” The 
senior diplomat turned to the other 
staff members waiting nearby on the 
tower-top helipad, moved among 
them shaking hands, then scrambled 
into the heli. It lifted and beat its 
way eastward against a backdrop of 
vermillion-bellied clouds in a sky of 
luminous violet. Behind Retief, the 
voice of Vice-Consul Wimperton 
rose to a shrill bark. 

“No want um basket! No need 
um beads! Want um heavy metal, 
you blooming idiot!” 

Retief turned. A short-legged, 
long-torsoed local draped in a stiff 
lime-green garment stood round- 
shouldered before the Commercial 
Attache, dwarfed under a load of 
fancifully beaded baskets. 


“No want um?” the Poon en- 
quired in a voice that seemed to 
thrum in his chest. “Plenty too 
cheap — ” 

“Nobody want um! How many 
times do I have to tell you, you 
bug-eyed — ” 

A curtain twitched aside from a 
narrow doorway; a spindle-legged 
Groaci in Bermuda shorts, argyle 
socks and a puce and magenta alo- 
ha shirt peered out. 

“Mr. Wimperton,” he said faint- 
ly, “I must request that you refrain 
from abusing the locals so loudly. I 
have a splitting headache.” 

T he deck lifted, creaking, and 
sank gently back. The Groaci 
put a hand against his midriff and 
clutched the doorframe. His name 
was Dools. He was new in his post 
— as well as in his citizenship. 

“My, that was a dandy,” Wimper- 
ton said. “Felt like my stomach came 
right up and bumped my chin!” 
“I’m sure we’re all aware of the 
motion, Mr. Wimperton. All too 
aware,” Dools whispered. 

“Say, you don’t look at all well, 
Mr. Consul-General,” Wimperton 
said solicitously. “It’s this constant 
rocking, up and down, to and fro. 
You can never tell which way the 
tower will lean next.” 

“Yes, yes, a penetrating observa- 
tion, Mr. Wimperton.” The Consul- 
General tilted two eye-stalks toward 
Retief. “If you’d step inside a mo- 
ment, Mr. Retief?” He held the 
curtain aside, let it drop behind 
Retief.

splashed a checkered pattern across 
colorful rugs of kelp fiber, low 
couches, desks and chairs of woven 
wicker work. Consul-General Dools 
looked at Retief nervously. 

“Mr. Retief,” he said in his faint 
voice. “Now that our previous chief, 
Mr. Magnan, has departed, I, of 
course, find myself in charge.” He 
paused while the floor lifted and 
sank; his eye-stalks waved sicken- 
ingly. 

“As a newcomer, perhaps you’ve 
noticed certain . oh . irregulari- 
ties in our little organization here.” 
Four of his eyes studied different 
corners of the room. Retief said 
nothing. 

“I wished merely to caution you: 
It would be unwise to evince exces- 
sive curiosity . .” 

Retief waited. The tower leaned 
to the steady pressure of the rising 
gale. The floor slanted. Consul- 
General Dool clung to a desk, his 
throat-sacs vibrating. 

“There are many ways,” he start- 
ed, “in which accidents could befall 
one here.” 


The floor sagged, rose abruptly. 
Dools eulped, threw Retief a last 
despairing glance and fled as Wim- 
perton came in, still muttering. He 
looked after the departing Groaci. 

“Consul-General Dools isn’t a 
very good sailor,” he commented. 
“Of course, in the week you’ve been 
here, you haven’t seen a real blow 


The native peddler poked his 
round head through the door hang- 
ing, padded across the room on 
large, bare webbed feet and paused 
before Retief. 


“You want um basket?” The 
round, amber-and-olive patterned 
face gazed hopefully at him. 

“I’ll take that one,” Retief said in 
the native language, pointing. 

The wide lipless mouth stretched 
wide in the local equivalent of a de- 
lighted grin. 

“A sale! I was beginning to think 
you High-Pockets — excuse me, sir 
— you Terries were tighter than 
weed-ticks in a belly-button.” He 
lowered his wares, . extracted the 
basket. 

“You shouldn’t encourage him,” 
Wimperton said snappishly. “For 
months I’ve been indoctrinating him 
to bring in some gold nuggets. The 
land-masses are practically solid 
with them — but no, they build 
their town on a raft of seaweed in 
mid-ocean and weave baskets!” 

“They evolved in the weed,” Re- 
tief said mildly. “And if they lifted 
the embargo on gold, in six months 
the planet would be swarming with 
prospectors, dumping their tailings 
into the ocean. They like it the way 
it is. 

The Poon caught Retiefs eyes, 
jerked his head toward the doorway, 
then ducked out through the door 
hanging. 

R etief waited half a minute, 
then rose lazily and stepped out 
on the wide observation deck. 

All around, lesser towers, intri- 
cately patterned, rose from the 
miles-long mat of yellow-green sea- 
weed far below, moving restlessly 
with the long ocean swells. Sea fowl 
with weed-colored backs and sky- 
blue undersides wheeled and

screamed. Between the raying pin- 
nacles, a spiderweb complex of cat- 
walks swung in hundred-yard fes- 
toons. A continuous creaking of rat- 
tan filled the air. Far away, the 
white-flecked surface of the open 
sea was visible. 

Retief crossed to where the Poon 
waited by the stairwell entry. 

“You seem like a good fellow,” 
the peddler said as Retief came up. 
“So I’ll give you some free advice.” 
He glanced around at the color- 
drenched sky. “There’ll be a Big 
Blow tonight. Get down below — 
don’t waste any time.” He hitched 
at his load of baskets and turned 
to the stairs. “And don’t bother to 
tell those clowns.” He jerked his 
head toward the Consular offices. 
“They’re bad medicine.” He bobbed 
his head and was gone. 

Retief threw a sharp glance at 
the clouds, got out a cigar and lit 
up, turned from the rail. 

A tall, broad-shouldered man in 
a somber uniform stood by the cat- 
walk mouth, looking Retief over. 
He came across the close-woven 
deck and thrust out a large, well- 
tanned hand. 

“My name’s Klamper, Planetary 
Monitor Service. I guess you’re the 
new man.” 

Retief nodded. 

“Let me give you some advice. 
Watch out for the natives. They’re 
sly, tricky devils.” He paused. “You 
were talking to one just now. Don’t 
let him lure you into going down 
into the native quarter. Nothing 
down there but natives and dark 
holes to fall into A helluva place 
for a Terry. Knifings, poisonings — 


nothing there worth climbing down 
thirty flights of wicker steps to look 
at.” 

Retief puffed at his dope stick. 
The wind swirled the smoke away. 

“Sounds interesting,” he said. “I’ll 
think it over.” 

“Plenty to do right up here in the 
Consulate tower,” Klamper said. “I 
guess you’ve seen the Tri-D tank — 
a twenty-footer — and the sublima- 
tion chamber. And there’s a pretty 
good auto-banquet. And don’t over 
look the library. They’ve got a few 
dandy sense-tapes there; I confis- 
cated them from a Joy-boat in a 
twelve mile orbit off Callisto last 
year.” The constable got out a dope- 
stick and cocked an eye at Retief. 
“What do you think of your Groaci 
boss, Consul-General Jack Dools?” 
“I haven’t seen much of him. 
He’s been seasick ever since I got 
here.” ^ 

“First time I ever ran into a 
Groaci in the CDT,” Klamper said. 
“A naturalized Terry, I hear. Well, 
maybe he hasn’t got all five eyes 
on an angle — but I’d say watch 
him.” Klamper hitched up his gun 
belt. “Well, I’ll be shoving off.” He 
glanced at the stormy sky. “Looks 
like I’ve got a busy night ahead.” 
Retief stepped back into the of- 
fice. A small, round man with pale 
hair and eyebrows looked up from 
the chair by Wimperton’s desk. 

“Oh.” Wimperton blinked at Re- 
tief. “I thought you’d gone for the 
day.” He folded a sheaf of papers 
hurriedly, snapped a rubber band 
around them, turned and dropped 
them in the drawer of the filing 
cabinet. 


THE CITY THAT GREW IN THE SEA

TTTimperton rose. “Well, I’ll be 
▼ ▼ nipping along to Dorm Tow- 
er, I believe, before the wind gets 
any worse. This breeze is nothing 
to what we get sometimes. I’d sug- 
gest you take care crossing the cat- 
walk, Retief. It can be dangerous. 
In a cross-wind, it sets up a steady 
ripple.” His limber hands demon- 
strated a steady ripple. “Other times 
it seems to float up and down.” He 
eyed Retief. “I hope the motion 
isn’t bothering you?” 

“I like it,” Retief said. “As a boy, 
I had ? habit of eating candy bars 
— you know, the sticky kind — 
while standing on my head on a 
merry-go-round.” 

Wimperton’s eyes stared fixedly 
at Retief. A fine sweat popped out 
on his forehead. 

“Feels like it’s building up, all 
right,” Retief said genially. “Feel 
that one?” 

A distant, thoughtful look crept 
over Wimperton’s face. 

“It’s good and hot in here, too,” 
Retief went on. “And there’s that 
slight odor of fish, or octopus, or 
whatever it is . 

“Uh ... I’d better see to the gold- 
fish,” Wimperton gasped. He rushed 
away. 

Retief turned to the round-faced 
man. 

“How was your trip, Mr. Pird?” 

“Ghastly,” Pird piped. His voice 
sounded like a rubber doll. “I visited 
continents One and Two. Bare rock. 
No life higher than insects, but 
plenty of those. You know, it never 
rains on Poon. All five continents 
are deserts, and the heat — ” 

“I understood the Zoological In- 


vestigation and Liaison Council 
Headquarters had financed a couple 
of wild-life census stations over 
there, Retief said. 

“To be sure, facilities were pro- 
vided by ZILCH but unhappily, 
no volunteers have come forward to 
man them.” Pird smiled sourly. “A 
pity. Consul-General Dools has ex- 
pressed a passionate interest in wild- 
life.” Pird grabbed at a paperweight 
as it slid across the desk-top. The 
walls creaked; wind shrilled, flap- 
ping the door hanging. The floor 
heaved and settled back. Pird swal- 
lowed, looking pale. 

“I believe I’d best be going,” he 
said, starting toward the door. 

“Hold it,” Retief called. Pird 
jerked. His eyes blinked. 

“Aren’t you going to warn me 
about anything?” 

Pird stared for a moment, then 
scurried off. 

A lone, Retief stood with 
braced feet in the Consular 
office, gloomy now in the eerie light 
of the stormy sunset. He crossed to 
the filing cabinet, took a small in- 
strument from a leather case and 
went to work on the lock. After 
five minutes’ work, the top drawer 
popped out half an inch. 

Retief pulled it open; it was emp- 
ty. The second contained a dry 
sandwich and a small green flask of 
blended whiskey. In the bottom 
drawer were four dog-eared copies 
of Saucy Stories, a prospectus in 
full-dimensional color illustrating 
Playtime on Paradise, the Planet 
with a Past, glossy catalogs describ- 
ing the latest in two-seater sport

IF 



helis and a fat document secured 
by a wide rubber band. 

Retief extracted the latter and 
opened the stiff paper. It was an 
elaborately worded legal instru- 
ment. In the fifth paragraph he 
read: 

" . whereas such body is other- 
wise uninhabited , unimproved, and 
subject to no prior claim filed with 
the proper authorities as specified in 
paragraph 2 A (3) above, and; 

Whereas claimant has duly estab- 
lished, by personal occupancy for a 
period of not less than six Standard 
Months, or by improvement to a 
value of . 

Retief read on, then removed the 
elaborately engraved cover sheet of 
the document, folded the rest and 
fitted it into an inside pocket. 

Outside, the wind rose to a howl- 
ing crescendo; the floor shuddered; 
the walls tilted precariously. Retief 
took a magazine from the drawer, 
fitted the document cover over it, 
folded it and snapped the red rub- 
ber band in place, then replaced it 
in the drawer and closed it. The 
lock seated with a snick. He left 
the consulate and crossed the sway- 
ing catwalk to the next tower. 

II 

R etief stood in the doorway of 
his room, smoking a cigar. Pird, 
just starting down the stairway, 
clucked. “Better hurry, sir. Everyone 
else has gone down. The wind is 
rising very rapidly.” 

‘Til be along.” Retief looked down 
the empty corridor, undulating in 
the dim late-evening light, then 


went along to a curtain-hung door- 
way and stepped out onto a wind- 
swept balcony. From it a swaying 
wicker catwalk launched itself in a 
dizzy span to the Consulate Tower, 
a hundred yards distant. 

A dim light winked on in the 
consular offices, moving about slow- 
ly. Retief watched for a moment, 
then turned up the collar of his 
windbreaker and stepped off into 
the dark tunnel of the wildly swing- 
ing passage. The gale buffeted at it 
with a ferocity that had increased 
even in the quarter-hour he had 
spent in the Dorm Tower. The sky 
had darkened to an ominous mauve, 
streaked with fiery crimson. Below, 
lights sparkled all across the lower 
levels. 

The last fifty feet of the crossing 
was a steep climb up the sagging 
catwalk. Abruptly the catwalk 
dropped three feet and came to a 
stop with its floor canted at a 
sharp angle. Retief steadied himself, 
then went on, climbing now. Ten 
feet ahead, the yellow and blue 
hanging at the end of the passage 
was visible. It moved. The slight 
figure of Consul Dools appeared 
for a moment, wrapped in a dark 
poncho, then whisked back out of 
view. 

Retief made another two yards 
against the bucking of the sloping 
passage. He could hear a rasping 
now, a harsh sawing sound. A 
wedge of electric-purple sky ap- 
peared through the wicker roof 
ahead. It widened . 

With an abrupt crackling of 
breaking fibers, the end of the cat- 
walk broke free and dropped like

an express elevator. Retief locked 
his fingers in the twisted rattan and 
held on. The face of the tower 
flashed past. Retief slid two feet and 
caught himself with his torso half 
out the open end. Air shrieked past 
his face. A foot from his eyes, the 
severed end of the supporting cable 
whipped in the screaming wind — 
cut clean. 

Retief looked down and saw the 
massed lights of the native section 
swooping up to meet him. A wall 
rushed close; Retief felt the whistle 
of air as he brushed it; then he 
was hurtling past low towers with 
lighted windows behind which alien 
faces gaped briefly. He swept low 
over a narrow street ablaze with 
colored lights, felt a shock as the 
catwalk brushed a building some- 
where above; then the street was 
falling away below as the free- 
swinging catwalk cracked-the-whip, 
soaring upward in a wild zoom, 
slowing now . 

A wall loomed before him with 
a narrow balcony before lighted 
windows. For an instant, it seemed 
to hang before his face — and Re- 
tief lunged, kicked his legs free of 
the twisted wicker. He caught the 
heavy rattan guard rail. He hung 
on,' groping with his feet, with the 
gale tearing at him, shrieking in his 
ears ... 

Hands gripped him, hauline him 
up. He shook his head to clear it, 
felt a heavy hanging brush his face. 
Then he was standing on a yielding 
floor, blinking in the soft light of a 
primitive incandescent lamp, feeling 
the warmth and strange, spicy odor 
of an alien room. 


A five-foot native stood be- 
fore him, staring up anxiously 
with large protruding green eyes in 
a smooth, olive-colored face. The 
wide, almost human mouth opened 
showing a flash of pink interior. 

“Are you all right, buddy?” a 
strangely resonant voice inquired in 
the bubbly local tongue. 

Retief felt of his jaw, moved his 
shoulders gingerly. “A little dazed 
by the speed with which the boys 
work, but otherwise fine/* he re- 
plied. 

“You speak Poon like a native, 
by Hoop!” the alien said. “Here sit 
down. How about a drink of Yi- 
quil?” He indicated a low couch 
heaped with varicolored cushions 
and turned to a cupboard, wide 
webbed feet in bright yellow sandals 
gripping the swaying floor. 

“You fell off a catwalk, eh?” 
“Something like that,” Retief ac- 
cepted a deep two-handled porce- 
lain jug, delicately shaped. He 
sniffed the drink, then sipped. 

“My name’s Url Yum. I’m a net- 
ter for Matwide Fooderies.” 

“Pm Retief. I’m with the Terran 
Consulate.” He glanced around the 
room. “Handsome apartment you 
have here.” 

“Oh, it’s all right.” There was a 
sharp whistle at the door. 

“You feel like meeting a bunch 
of people? I guess they saw you 
fall, and they’ll be crowding in now 
to take a look at you. We don’t 
often see Terries here in town, you 
know.” 

“I’d rather not go on exhibit right 
now. Yum.” 

“Sure, I know how you feel. I had

IF 



to go over to Dryport on business 
a few months back, and every damn 
do-gooder wanted to have me in for 
tea and look me over.” 

The whistle sounded again at the 
door. Url Yum padded across to 
the closet, brought out a large 
satchel and pulled out bright- 
colored gear of plastic and metal. 

“I was just about to go for a 
swim. Why don’t you join me? You 
don’t want to go back up tonight 
in this wind. We can go down the 
back way. How about it?” 

“A swim? In this weather?” 

“The best time. Hunting’s good. 
The small stuff shelters under the 
Mat, and the big stuff is in there 
hunting them — and we hunt the 
big stuff.” He held up a polished 
spearhead. 

“Look, Yum, I’m just a Terry. I 
can’t hold my breath more than a 
minute or two.” 

“Neither can I. That’s what the 
gear’s for. You burn oxygen, same 
as we do, don’t you?” 

The whistle came again, more 
peremptory now. “Hey, Yum!” a 
voice called. 

Retief finished his drink. “That 
yiquil’s great stuff, Yum; it’s already 
affecting my judgment. Let’s go!” 

T hey stood in a narrow way 
that wound between high walls 
hung with dights and signboards, 
studded with balconies from which 
pennants fluttered, crowded with 
brilliantly mantled and jeweled Pu- 
poony, filled with the shriek of wind, 
the chatter of whistled conversa- 
tion, and over all the polyphonic 
creaking of the city. 


“Fve heard of twisting roads,” Re- 
tief called. “This is the first time I 
ever saw one that really twisted.” 
Yum put his mouth close to Re- 
liefs ear. “You know the whistle 
dialect?” 

“I can understand it,” Retief 
shouted back. “But I can’t whistle 
it.” 

Yum motioned, led the way down 
a side alley to a sea-shell ornament- 
ed hanging and pushed into a low 
room with couches along one wall, 
open shelves on another. A portjy 
Poon waddled forward. 

“Oi, Yum! Oi, stranger.” 

“Oi,” Yum said. “Gipp, this is Re- 
tief. We’re going down. Can you 
fix him up with a spray job?” 
“Lucky you came to my place, 
Yum. I happen to have a com- 
pound specially prepared for Terry 
requirements, a fresh batch, just 
concocted yesterday.” 

“Good. Retief, put your stuff 
over there.” Yum opened his sat- 
chel, took out equipment and laid it 
out on a low table. He selected a 
pair of goggles, handed them to Re- 
tief. “These are a little big, but I 
think they’ll seat all right.” He 
handed over a heavy cylinder the 
size and shape of a beer bottle, 
added other items. 

“Okay: propulsion, communica- 
tion lights, breathing apparatus, 
emergency gear. Now, after you 
strip and get your equipment buck- 
led on, Gipp will fit you with wa- 
ter-foils and spray you in.” 

Retief donned the gear and 
watched with interest while the 
portly proprietor shaped a putty-like 
material to his feet, forming large

fins which stiffened to a rubbery 
consistency, then brought out a por- 
table apparatus with a tank, com- 
pressor and hose with a wide noz- 
zle. 

“Give him a Striding Devil job, 
Gipp,” Yum ordered. 

Gipp hesitated, looking at Re- 
tief. “I suppose you’ve had a lot of 
experience — ?” 

“He’ll be all right,” Yum put in. 
“He catches on fast, and he’s got 
a good arm.” 

“Whatever you say, Yum — but 
you ought to warn him that a 
Death Angel will jump a Strider on 
sight.” 

“Sure. That way we don’t have to 
go looking for ’em.” 

“Well, if you get one remember 
I’m paying top sprud for stones.” 

“You’ll get first crack.” 

Gipp started up the compressor, 
twiddled knobs, then directed a 
heavy spray of viscous, greenish 
fluid on Retief’s chest, working it in 
a pattern that covered him to the 
knees. Then the Poon shut down 
and set about changing hoses. 

“What’s this stuff for?” Retief in- 
quired, studying the thick, soft lay- 
er hardening on his skin. 

“Protective covering. It’s tough as 
yuk skin. And it has an osmotic ac- 
tion; passes oxygen in, and CO 2 
out. The color disguises you so you 
don’t scare off the game — and the 
finished job holds all your gear in 
place. It’s a good insulation, too. 
That water’s cold. It strips off easily 
when you come back in.” 

Gipp worked for another five 
minutes. Retief craned his neck to 
look at himself. His back, he saw, 


was a dull black, with red and white 
flecks, separated from the glossy 
green front by pale gray sides. 
Broad pink gill-flaps flared from 
throat to shoulders. The ankles and 
fin-covered feet were a vivid red. 

“He’s got the build for it,” Gipp 
said, looking him over. “If I hadn’t 
done the job myself, I’d swear he 
was a Strider, by Hoop?” 

“That’s the idea, Gipp. Now jus 
give me a straight Big Mouth out- 
fit.” Yum took a flask from a side 
pocket and offered it to Retief, who 
took a generous pull, then passed 
it to Gipp, busy with his apparatus. 

“No, thanks. I don’t need any de- 
lusions of grandeur tonight. I hope 
to do a good volume of business be- 
fore the storm hits its peak.” He 
worked carefully, covered Yum 
with a uniform dull gray, added a 
peaked crest of garish yellow. 

“All right, Retief.” Yum handed 
him a light, short-barreled rifle 
from the muzzle of which a razor- 
edgjed spearhead protruded. “Let’s 
go down.” 

Gipp led the way to a back room 
and opened a wide wicker cover set 
in the floor. Retief looked down to 
the sloping surface of a three-foot 
tube of close-woven strips. 

“Follow me,” Yum said, and 
dived, head first, out of sight. Re- 
tief gripped his spear-gun, waved 
Gipp a cheery farewell and dived 
after him.

of green and blue and, far below, 
dull gleams of violet. Retief kicked 
his feet, watched lights scatter be- 
fore him in a boil of phosphores- 
cence. 

A dark shape darted from the 
gloom and hovered before him. He 
recognized Yum’s yellow crest, wav- 
ing gently in the moving water. 

“Only peaceful place in town, 
when the wind’s working,” Yum’s 
voice crackled in Retiefs ears. 
“Let’s work our way east to get 
clear of the activity around here; 
then we’ll see if we can’t bait an 
Angel up.” 

“How deep are we?” 

“The Mat’s twenty meters thick 
here. We’re going to work Under- 
side first; if that’s no go, we’ll move 
down.” 

Yum darted off with a flick of 
webbed feet. Retief followed. 
Above, the mass of the floating con- 
tinent of weed was a fairyland tan- 
gle of waving fronds, fantastically 
shaped corals, coiling weed, and 
moving lights. 

“Use the knob on your left hip 
as a jet control,” Yum said. “Steer 
with your feet — and keep your 
rifle ready. If you see anything that 
looks like you, let him have it.” 

Retief tried the knob, felt water 
chum past his knees; he leaped 
ahead, driving through the water 
with a speed that blurred the weed- 
scape above. A slight twist of the 
ankles sent him angling sharply to- 
ward the depths; a minute adjust- 
ment brought him back to Yum's 
side. His eyes adjusted to the dark- 
ness, picked out the shapes behind 
the lights now. Massive, sluggish 


swimmers cruised, wide jaws open. 
Slim torpedo shapes darted and 
wheeled. A nebulous form, glowing 
with a nacreous pink, rose up and 
reached out with feathery arms; 
Yum swerved away, Retief follow- 
ing fifteen feet to one side of his 
bubble-trail. 

After a ten-minute . run, Yum 
slowed, rose until he brushed the 
tops of the coral trees, then reached 
up with his feet, planted them in a 
swirl of smoky mud and stood, in- 
verted. Retief came alongside, 
twisted, felt the soft ooze under his 
feet. 

“It’s a little confusing at first,” 
Yum’s voice came clear in Retiefs 
ears. “But you’ll get used to it.” 

Retief looked around. The undu- 
lating surface of the weed mass 
stretched away into deep gloom, 
studded with waving fronds, stiff- 
branched trees of red-violet, 
orange and chartreuse coral, feath- 
ery banks of leafy undergrowth set 
with multi-colored flowers as big as 
dinner plates, among which moving 
lights sparkled and played. 

“I’ll pace you, off to the left,” 
Yum said. “Move along with big, 
leaping strides. Anything your size 
except another Strider will give you 
a wide berth. If you see one, hit him 
fast. Aim for the mid-section. Now, 
if we pick up an Angel, you’ll no- 
tice the shadow first. Just keep mov- 
ing; I’ll get under him and hit him 
where it hurts. When he turns, give 
it to him near the big red spot on 
his back. Got it?” 

“How many rounds in this rifle?” 

“Five in the magazine, and a 
spare on your left shoulder.” 


THE CITY THAT GREW IN THE SEA

“How do we know there aren’t 
other hunters around? I’d hate to 
spear a friend of yours by mistake.” 
“You’ll get a recognition tone in 
your phones if anybody gets with- 
in fifteen yards — maybe. That’s 
part of the game. I got a nice barb 
cut out of my left leg last year. 
Some' joker wanted a Big Mouth 
for cut bait.” Yum waved and 
flicked away. Retief picked an open 
avenue between towering corals and 
started off. Walking was not too dif- 
ficult after the first few steps; ra- 
ther like tramping the dusty surface 
of an asteroid, he reflected — ex- 
cept that the diving gear was con- 
siderably less bulky than a space- 
suit. 

T here was a movement to Re- 
tiefs right. A tall biped stalker 
into view ten yards distant, barely 
visible in the glow of phosphores- 
cence. Retief halted and brought the 
gun around. The newcomer moved 
on in great floating leaps. Retief 
turned to follow. 

“Never mind the Strider,” Yum 
said. “He didn’t see you; he must 
have just fed. We’ll work off to the 
right here and let him have this 
territory.” 

Retief watched as the biped 
bounded off into the gloom, then 
moved on. 

Ahead, the darkness seemed 
deeper. A cow-sized creature with 
warts and glowing rings around 
wide eyes blundered past, rocking 
him with a surge of water. Tiny 
fish flashed by. The gloom deep- 
ened. 

“Action!” Yum’s voice came, 


tense in the earphones. “Keep go- 
ing; we’ve got a big one coming up 
to take a look!” 

Retief twisted to look toward the 
depths, like a black sky in which a 
dark cloud moved. He went on. 

“That’s the stuff. Act like you 
don’t notice him; otherwise he’ll let 
fly with his musk, and we’ll be work- 
ing in the dark . .” 

The shadow moved, spreading. 
All around, the scene darkened. At 
last a sluggish sea-creature humped 
past, raising a trail of mud-fog. 

“Hey,” Yum’s voice came. “He’s 
by-passing us, moving on.” 

“Maybe he’s just not hungry to- 
night.” 

“It’s that Strider we saw; he’s 
after him. Let’s go!” 

Retief turned, saw a swirl of 
phosphorescence, jetted after it. 
The surface of the weed sloped, an 
inverted hill. Retief moved up be- 
side Yum, following the immense 
shadow that fled across the rolling 
surface. The Strider came into 
view, leaning back toward the two 
hunters. 

“Take him!” Yum barked. “Ill 
get under the big boy!” He swirled 
away. Retief brought the rifle to 
his shoulder, aimed — 

A brilliant light flashed from the 
Strider’s chest. The creature 
reached, grabbing at its back . 

“Hold it!” Yum’s voice snapped. 
“That’s no Strider!” 

The long greenish beam of the 
searchlight swung, flashing from 
coral trees, glowing through drift- 
ing mud-clouds. 

“The damned fool! He’d better 
douse that light!”

The Death Angel closed, like a 
hundred-foot blanket of black jelly 
settling in; the stranger backed, 
working frantically to fit a maga- 
zine to his rifle, bringing it up — 
The Angel struck. For a moment 
it hugged the surface of the weed, 
rippling its edge — then it heaved, 
recoiling violently — 

“Good-oh!” Yum yelled. “I plant- 
ed one fair and square! Move in 
and hit the hot-spot, Retief, and 
we’ll be up half the night counting 
gold over a bottle of hundred-year 
yiqu.'l!” 

Retief hurled himself forward, 
kicked clear of the weed-bed, cen- 
tered his sights on a foot-wide 
patch of luminous red at the cen- 
ter of the vast writhing shape, and 
fired, fired again, then went tum- 
bling as the turbulence caught him 
and bowled him over. 

R etief and Yum crouched by 
the prone body of the Angel’s 
victim. 

“He’s a Terry, all right, Retief. 
I wonder what he was doing Un- 
derside — alone?” 

“Probably a tourist, out to see the 
sights. Though I hadn’t heard of 
any travellers registered with the 
Consulate.” 

“You may be right. We’re not far 
from the Tap Root; he was headed 
that way, and he seemed to know 
where he was going.” 

Retief checked the man’s equip- 
ment, noted his pulse and respira- 
tion. 

“He seems to be all right.” 

“Sure. He just took a good jolt of 
current. We didn’t give the Big Boy 


a chance to get his shredding hooks 
into him.” 

“We’d better take him up.” 

“Sure. Soon as we stone out our 
Angel, before the Big Mouths get 
him. There’s a public entry-well not 
far away; probably the one he used. 
We’ll just tow him along with us. 
He’ll be okay.” 

The vast bulk of the Angel drift- 
ed fifty yards from the crowns of 
the coral trees. They swam to it, 
shooed off an inquisitive scavenger, 
moved around to the red spot on 
the expanse of black hide. A short 
spear stood, half its length buried 
dead center in the target. A second 
spear protruded a foot away. 

Yum whistled. “You work close, 
Retief. Nice shooting.” He un- 
dipped a slim-bladed knife, made an 
incision, plunged an arm into the 
rubbery body and brought out a 
lumpy organ the size of a grape- 
fruit. He whistled again. 

“This must be the beachmaster of 
all Angels! Look at the size of that 
pouch!” He slit the leathery bag 
carefully, dipped in two fingers and 
extracted a black sphere as big as 
a large grape. 

“Retief, we make a great team. 
Look at those stones!” 

“What do you use them for?” 

“We grind them up and sprinkle 
them on our food. A great deli- 
cacy.” 

“Yum, what’s this Tap Root you 
mentioned?” 

“Eh? Why, it’s — well, it’s the 
root that supplies the mat.” 

“Just one for all this weed?” 

“Sure; it’s all one plant — the 
whole Mat.”

IF 



“I’d like to take a look at it. I 
can’t picture a Terry swimming 
around down here at the height of 
a storm, just to rubberneck — not 
unless it’s a pretty spectacular 
sight.” 

“It doesn’t look like much. Just a 
big, tough cable, running down into 
the Big Deep.” Yum tucked the 
pearls into a pouch clipped to his 
belt and led the way along the slop- 
ing weed .surface. He indicated a 
dark mass ahead. 

CCnphat’s it — back in that tan- 
Agle of rootlets there. The 
Tap’s a hundred feet in diameter 
and over a mile long. It anchors 
the Mat, and feeds it, too.” 

“Let’s take a closer look.” 

Retief moved in among the wav- 
ing rootlets. 

“Say — what’s that?” Yum’s voice 
came over the earphones. Ahead, a 
large dark shape nestled among the 
entwining roots. Retief swam up 
alongside. 

“It’s a scout boat — Terry de- 
sign.” He swam to the entry port, 
found it locked. “Let’s reconnoiter 
a little, Yum.” 

The two moved over the waving 
mass of rootlets, cruising beside the 
moss-grown, barnacled wall of the 
immense root. Retief caught a 
glimpse of a white object, flutter- 
ing in the dark water. He headed 
for it. 

It was a plastic tag, wired to a 
spike driven into the husk of the 
root. Below it hung a small box, 
metal covered, with an insulated, 
cable projecting from one side. 

“What is it? Who’d come here and 


tamper with the Root?” Yum asked, 
puzzled. 

“It’s a detonator,” Retief said. 
“The cable is designed to plug into 
a packaged explosive charge.” 
“Explosive! Here, by the Root?” 
“How long would the weed last 
with the root cut?” 

“Last? It wouldn’t last a day! 
You cut a sprig of the weed, it 
crumbles in a matter of minutes. 
Oh, the fruit, leaves, husks, are 
tough enough — but the main mass 
would disintegrate like a sugar lump 
in a mug of hot roca.” 

“Somewhere there’s a bomb to 
go with the detonator, Yum,” Re- 
tief said. “Probably aboard the boat. 
Our swimmer was on the way to 
get it, I’d guess. Let’s check him 
for keys. 

Yum fumbled over the limp 
body. “He’s clean, Retief. He must 
have lost them in the fight.” 

“All right; let’s get him to the 
surface and see what he has to say.” 

IV 

I n the damp-smelling cavern of 
the public entry hall, Retief 
stood over the unconscious man. 
Water dripped from him, puddled 
on the heavy-duty rattan ramp that 
sloped up from the water. The at- 
tendant on duty came forward, 
clucked at the sight of the inert 
body. 

“He left here, not fifteen min- 
utes ago. Wouldn’t accept my offer 
of a guide. I warned him . .” 
“Where are his clothes?” Retief 
asked. 

“On the shelf — there.” The at-

tendant pointed to a coat, trousers, 
boots, a tangle of heavy leather 
belts and an empty holster in a neat 
pile. 

“A cop?” Retief said. He ex- 
amined the garments. “No identifi- 
cation,” he said. “And no keys.” 
“What happened?” the attendant 
asked. 

“An Angel hit him.” 

“He’ll be out for hours, then,” the 
attendant said. “A big Angel gives 
a pretty good shock. Hahl These 
tourists are all alike.” 

“Yum, you don’t have a police 
force here — or an army?” 

“No. What would we need with 
those?” 

“Can you get a few friends to- 
gether — volunteers, to watch the 
patrol boat?” 

“Sure, Retief. All you want.” 
“Station about a dozen in the un- 
derbrush around the boat. Tell 
them to keep out of sight — we 
don’t want to scare anybody off. 
But be careful. A spear-gun is no 
match for a Mark IV blaster.” 

“I’ll call the boys.” Yum went in- 
to the attendant’s office, emerged 
five minutes later. 

“All set,” he declared. “What 
about him?” He indicated the sleep- 
ing cop. 

“Have the fellow on duty watch 
him until your friends get here. 
Meanwhile, he’d better put him 
somewhere out of sight.” 

“What about the bomb?” 

“We’ll have to try to stampede 
somebody. Whoever sent our friend 
here doesn’t know he didn’t make 
it.” 

Retief looked at Yum, frowning 


in thought. “Yum, peel out of that 
scare suit and put the uniform on.” 
He began stripping off the Striding 
Devil disguise. “I’ll borrow some lo- 
cal garb.” 

“You’ve got an idea?” 

“Not much of one. Just a wild 
hunch.” 

Yum kicked free of the last of 
the diving gear, pulled on the shape- 
less Patrol outfit. It hung ludicrous- 
ly on his squat frame. 

“Retief, I wouldn’t fool anybody 
in this.” 

“That’s just the point, Yum. Now 
let’s move!” 

Y um stopped before a dark 
entry and pointed up at a 
lighted floor above. 

“This is it,” he called over the 
howling wind. Retiefs long violet 
cloak whipped at his ankles; Yum 
held onto his patrolman’s cap with 
one hand. 

“All right.” Retief leaned close to 
Yum and shouted. “You wait five 
minutes, Yum; then just move off 
down the street. Move as though 
you were in a hurry. Then you’d 
better go back and help out the 
boys. If anybody comes close, let 
him get the port open; then hit him 
fast.” 

“Well — I guess you know what 
you’re doing.” 

Retief climbed the trembling 
wicker stairway, gripping the hand- 
rail as a violent gust bounced him 
against the swaying wall. Two 
flights up he pushed aside a hang- 
ing lettered TERRESTRIAL CON- 
SULATE GENERAL — EMER- 
GENCY QUARTERS.

Wimperton and Pird looked up 
from a table on which a meal of 
emergency rations was laid out in 
the bleak light of a feeble DC lamp. 
Wimperton’s mouth opened wide. 
Pird scrambled up and stood wiping 
his fingers on his pink vest. 

“Hi, boys, ,, Retief said cheerfully. 
“Damnedest thing happened to me. 
You’ll never guess.” 

“Ah . you fell out a window?” 
Wimperton hazarded. 

“Close, but no dope-stick; the cat- 
walk broke under me. Quite a ride.” 
He strolled to the window. “Some 
wind out there. Say . 

“Yes, indeed, quite a wind, you’re 
right,” Pird piped. 

“Look here,” Retief said. “Is that 
a Patrolman? Wonder what he’s do- 
ing out in the storm!” 

Wimperton and Pird jumped to 
the window, craned. Below, Yum’s 
ungainly figure waddled briskly 
along the pitching street, turned a 
corner. 

“Hey, that’s — ” Wimperton 
started. 

“Yes, that’s strange, all right,” 
Pird cut in. “Poor weather for a 
stroll.” 

“But that wasn’t — ” 

“Wasn’t anything for us to worry 
about, ha ha,” Pird babbled. He 
pretended to yawn. “Well, about 
time to turn in, eh?” He patted his 
mouth, watching Retief. 

“Pm glad you suggested that,” 
Retief said. “I was afraid you’d 
want to sit up and talk.” 

“Just take that first room there,” 
Pird said eagerly. “Lovely room. 
Just lie right down and drift right 
off. Wimperton, you show Mr. Re- 


tief the room and I’ll just . ah . , . 
check a few things.” 

Retief glanced back from tha 
door, caught a glimpse of Pird dart- 
ing past the outer hanging. Ha 
stepped into the room. There was a 
tidy bunk, an easy chair, a rug, a 
tri-D set. 

“This is dandy.” He patted the 
bed. “Well, Wimperton, have a 
pleasant night.” 

“Yes, indeed. You too.” Wimper- 
ton disappeared. Retief flipped the 
light off, lay back on the bed and 
waited. A minute passed. The door 
curtain twitched aside for a mo- 
ment, dropped back. Lights winked 
off in the outer room. 

Retief rose, glanced out. The 
shelter was deserted. He crossed to 
the outer hanging, went down the 
swaying wicker stairs three at a 
time, stepped out into the storm- 
whipped street. Pird and Wimper- 
ton, each dragging a suitcase, stag- 
gered out of sight around the cor- 
ner. Retief wrapped the cloak close 
aid followed. 

S tanding in the shadows by the 
straining, wicker-work wall of 
a Public Entry Well, Retief watched 
Wimperton and Pird as they paced 
the ramp. Pird glanced at a finger 
watch. 

“ . any time now ...” the words 
came faintly through the hammer 
of the wind and the groaning of 
wicker. Pird stopped before Wim- 
perton, apparently asking a ques- 
tion. 

Wimperton reached inside his 
coat, brought out a thick packet of 
papers restrained by a red rubber

band, waved them at Pird, put 
them back. Retief edged somewhat 
closer.” 

“ . don’t like it either,” Wim- 
perton’s nasal voice stated. “Either 
the locals are wise — or they’ve got 
a deal with . .” The wind whirled 
the words away. 

Retief stepped back into the 
street, saw the pink glow of a pub- 
lic phone fifty yards distant. He 
fought his way to it through the 
wind, dialed and asked to speak to 
Yum. 

“No action here yet,” the native 
said. “How did the routine go over?” 

“Our pigeons flew the coop, all 
right. They know they’ve got trou- 
bles, but they’re not sure just what 
kind. They’re at a Public Entry 
near the Consulate, waiting for a 
pickup.” 

“They’ll have a long wait. Their 
driver’s still asleep.” 

“Yum, I have a feeling the 
bomb’s timed to go off at the peak 
of the storm. How long will that 
be?” 

“Oh, about two hours, I’d say.” 

“What will conditions be like at 
the top of the Consulate Tower 
now?” 

“Rough. The towers lean to the 
wind. The ceilings fold right down 
against the floors in a good blow 

— and this pne’s a dandy.” 

“We’re about out of time, Yum 

— and there are two parties still 
unaccounted for. Pm afraid I have 
one more trip in this wind.” 

“You’re coming back here?” 

“I’m going up — and I’d rather get 
moving while there’s still crawl space 
in the Consulate.” 


A howling gale struck Re- 
tief’s head as he hauled him- 
self up from a dark opening onto 
the thirtieth-floor balcony and 
looked up the long slant of the tow- 
er face. Forty feet above, the guard 
rail lining the terrace of the Con- 
sulate pent-house was dimly visible 
in the murk. 


Under Retief, the tower wall 
trembled and moved like a living 
thing. He reached for a handhold, 
started up the thirty-degree slope. 
Gusts tore at him. He rested, hug- 
ging the surface, then went on. Ten 
minutes later he pulled himself over 
and lay full length on the steep 
slope of the tower roof. 

The wind was less, here in the 
shelter of the canted floor. Retief 
slid down, then jumped, tumbled 
through the wind-tattered entry 
hanging, caught himself and blinked 
through the gloom of the deserted 
office. 

From the far wall, a grunt sound- 
ed. Retief made his way across the 
room and flicked a wall switch. 
Dim light glowed, showed him the 
trussed form of Consul-General 
Jack Dools huddled in the angle of 
wall and floor. Five blood-shot eye- 
stalks quivered appealingly at Re- 
tief. 

He went to a tilted desk, extract- 
ed a letter knife from a clip, came 
back and sawed at the cords bind- 
ing the Groaci, then pulled the gag 
free of the mandibles. 

“Ah, the shining of the sun on 
your ancestral egg-hill,” Dools 
gasped in Groaci. “To express heart- 
felt gratitude; to vow eternal chum- 
ship .

IF 



“Think nothing of it, Mr. Dools. 
You feel well enough to travel? 
We’ll have to go down the outside. 
The stairs are collapsed.” 

“How pleasant to see you alive, 
dear fellow,” Dools went on in Ter- 
ran. “I feared the miscreants had 
done their worst. I tried to inter- 
fere, but alas — ” 

“I saw you. At the time, I had 
the idea you were doing the saw- 
ing, but then I got to thinking about 
the booze and girly-book supply in 
the filing cabinet. Alcohol would 
poison you and as for unadorned 
mammals — ” 

“Mr. Retief, take care!” Dools 
hissed. “My hearing is keen; some- 
one comes ” 

Retief looked toward the door- 
way, then hastily tucked the cut 
ends of the rope out of sight under 
Dools’ body. “Play ’em close to your 
thorax, Mr. Dools,” he cautioned. 

A tall figure climbed through the 
flapping door hanging, crouched on 
the sloping floor, braced by one 
hand. The other held a power pis- 
tol, aimed at Retief. 

“Just stay where you are, bright 
boy,” Klamper s called over the 
screech of the wind. “Don’t bother 
untying him. My errand won’t take 
but a minute.” 

p 

He half-slid, half-crawled to the 
filing cabinet, keeping both eyes on 
Retief, fumbled a key from a pock- 
et. He opened the top drawer, then 
the next, rummaged, tried the last 
drawer, then turned on Retief, 
showing even white teeth in an ex- 
pression that was not a smile. 

“I ought to have my head ex- 
amined. I let those two lightweights 

THE CITY THAT GREW IN THE SEA 


sell me a story. What an act! Wim- 
perton gobbled like a turkey when 
he opened up that phoney cover and 
got a load of the funny-books in- 
side. So I let ’em sucker me into a 
goose-chase . unless you’ve got 
it?” He came closer. “Turn out your 
pockets, hotshot.” 

Retief shook his head. “If you’re 
looking for the papers, forget it. I 
left them in my other suit.” 

“You loused up six months* work, 
greenhorn. But I’ll be back to fill 
out some fresh forms. Too bad you 
won’t be here to watch.” 

He raised the power pistol; be- 
hind him, Dools lunged for the pa- 
trolman’s ankle. 

A bolt of blue fire crackled 
harmlessly past Retief’s ear as he 
leaned aside, chopped at Klamper’s 
gun hand, followed up with a knee 
to the face. Klamper rolled with the 
blow, scrambled over a sagging 
desk and dived for the doorway. 
Dools started after him. 

“Let him go, Mr. Dools,” Retief 
said. “I think I know where he’s 
headed. Now let’s get out of here 
before we get our clothes pressed 
— with us in ’em!” 

V 

A t the Public Entry Well, 
Yum and a group of well- 
muscled locals met Retief. 

“Our man was here about ten 
minutes ago,” Yum said blandly, 
“Big fellow, in a big hurry.” 

“You let him through?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Then you warned the boys at 
the boat to stop him?” 

61 



“Well, no, Retief. I told them to 
let him go. As you pointed out, he 
had a blaster. He’s several hundred 
miles out by now.” 

Retief folded his arms. “There’s 
something funny going on here, 
Yum. What about the bomb? It’s 
probably timed to go off at the 
height of the storm — say in an- 
other ten minutes.” 

“Oh, that. I found it. It’s taken 
care of.” 

“Found it where? And how the 
devil do you take care of a sealed 
titanite charge?” 

“It was aboard the boat. You 
were right about that — ” 

“Come on, Yum. Give!” 

“Well, Retief, I was a little cur- 
ious. You can’t blame me, after 
meeting you under such — unusual 
circumstances. I took a look 
through your clothes. I found this.” 
He held up the document Retief 
had extracted from the Consulate 
files. “A fancy piece of paper lay- 
ing claim to the whole damned 
planet of Poon — which it states is 
uninhabited — which it would have 
been if the bomb idea had worked 
out. The Mat would have broken up 
in the wind, and when the sky 
cleared, it would look like just an- 
other natural disaster. And in a few 
months, all five continents would be 
one big gold mine.” 

“So?” 

“So I held out on you. Our slum- 
bering pal had keys, all right. I 
went back and opened up the boat. 
There sat the bomb — all labelled and 
ready to go.” 

“Except for the detonator. That 
was wired to the root.” 


“Uh-huh. A safety precaution. 
But I found another one. It wasn’t 
hard to install. I had an idea the 
owner would be along to see about 
it before zero hour; but I didn’t like 
the sight of the thing sitting out in 
the middle of the floor, so I tucked 
it away.” 

“Where?” 

“In the chart storage bin.” 

Retief whirled to the discarded 
Terran uniform, jerked the commu- 
nicator from the lapel clip, keyed 
it on .the official frequency. 

“Klamper, if you can hear me, 
answer — fast!” 

After a moment, Klamper’s voice 
came back, a thin piping in the min- 
iature earphone. Yum and Dools 
leaned closer. 

“Klamper here. Who’re you?” 
“This is Retief, Klamper — ” 

“Oh, yeah, the bright young of- 
ficial. Well, I predict a big change 
in the near future for you. In about 
thirty seconds, to be exact.” 
“Klamper, there’s a bomb — ” 
“Well, well, so you found out 
about that, too. Sorry I can’t help 
you. So long, su — ” The earphones 
went dead. 

“Klamper!” 

Yum looked at his watch. “Right 
on the button,” he said. 

“At least,” Dools said, “he lived 
long enough to exonerate Mr. Re- 
tief.” 

sphere was a patter of hurried 
footsteps. Retief and Yum 
turned. In the door, Wimperton 
and Pird stood like ruffled birds, 
staring. 

“I’m afraid you lads missed the 


66 


IF 



boat,” Retief called. Yum signaled 
with his hand. Half a dozen local 
citizens fanned out to hem in the 
newcomers. 

“Oh, why Mr. Retief . What 
are you doing out of bed?” Pird 
squeaked. 

“Oh, I just dropped down to of- 
fer you boys a crack at a peachy 
new opportunity in the Achieve- 
ment Corps. Consul-General Dools 
here has need of two volunteers to 
man the new wildlife census sta- 
tions over on continents One and 
Two. I’m going to give you first 
grabs at it. We’ll go over to the 
Shelter and type out your resigna- 
tions from the CDT and a couple 
of five-year enlistment contracts in 
the A.C. — on a non-compensa- 
tory basis, of course.” 

Wimperton’s mouth sagged open. 

“And I have a number of micro- 
tape recordings I’ll contribute,” 
Dools said. “They’re quite exciting. 
All about bombs and land claims 
and gold mines. You can play them 
over during your leisure time — 
during sand-storms, perhaps.” 

“But — Mr. Retief,” Pird cried. 
“We — we’ve found conditions here 
somewhat less than congenial . .” 

“What if we refuse?” Wimperton 
gulped. 

“In that case, Yum and his asso- 


ciates would like to interview you 
on the subject of homesteading.” 
“Your pen or mine for the signa- 
ture?” Pird said hastily. 

“I’ll ask a couple of the boys to 
help these two philanthropists over 
to the Consulate,” Yum said. “Let 
the business wait till morning.. You 
and I have a bottle of Yiquil to 
finish, Retief.” 

“Show Mr. Dools a few of those 
pearls we netted, Yum.” 

Yum fished out the stones, hand- 
ed them to Dools, who canted two 
pairs of eye-stalks at the lustrous 
one-inch spheres. 

“Gentlemen — this is precisely 
the product I need to qualify Poon 
as a Class One commercial world! 
Can these be supplied in any vol- 
ume? Say, a dozen a month?” 

“I think it could be arranged,” 
Yum said in heavily accented Ter- 
ran. “Why don’t you join Retief and 
the boys and me in a snort?” 

“Well, I really don’t think . 

“I know a barman who can con- 
coct a suitable booze for any metab- 
olism,” Yum urged. “And a hang- 
over cure afterwards.” 

Retief linked arms with the slen- 
der Groaci. “Come along Mr. Con- 
sul-General,” he said. “We won’t 
take no for an answer.”

HOW 

TO HAVE A 
HIROSHIMA 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 


CC'T'he next great breakthrough 
Ain science,” I said during a re- 
cent symposium, “the breakthrough 
that will have the kind of impact 
on us all that the Hiroshima bomb 
had, will be in the area of psycho- 
physiology: mind and brain. And 
the man who will bring it about 
walks the earth today.” 

Since then I have been asked 
many times to say a little more 
about this, and I’m happy to oblige. 
Let me begin, however, with a dis- 
claimer: I can’t say exactly what 
the breakthrough will be. I am con- 
vinced of what kind it will be, how- 
ever, for one simple reason: you 
can’t,, you just can not, do as much 
research, in as many ways, with as 
many advanced tools, as are being 
turned to this goal, without making 
such a breakthrough! 

Consider: Dr. Lilly, in his pursuit 
of the language of the dolphins 


(work which is partly financed by 
the Space Administration, which has 
an exciting reason, to science-fiction 
readers: how do you communicate 
with a mind as good as a man’s, 
but not like a man’s?) uses a tech- 
nique called stereotaxia — among 
many, many others. Imagine a rigid 
steel frame in which the head of 
the subject is clamped, after careful 
measurement. X-rays and surface 
mapping. On the frame are three 
thumbscrews, each of which directs 
a long fine sterilized electrode in a 
different dimension: one for up and 
down, one for right and left, one 
for forward and back. Each one is 
calibrated and has a vernier adjust- 
ment. At the desired location, a fine 
hole is drilled in the skull, just down 
to the dura mater , the very outside 
tissue of the brain. Then the elec- 
trode is positioned and lowered 
down through the brain cells, to the 


68 


precise location under study. The 
researcher presses a button, and a 
carefully measured, tiny pulse of 
electricity jolts the small area — 
perhaps only a dozen cells — at the 
tip of the electrode. Observations 
are then made — and they are ex- 
traordinary. 

A human subject will exper- 
ience flashes of light, or hot 
or cold sensations at certain parts 
of his body, or perhaps a burst of 
sound. Sometimes there are 
snatches of memory — and some of 
these are not real! 

Exactly what reaction is exper- 
ienced depends on the location of 
the probe and the intensity of the 
current. Bit by bit, segment by seg- 
ment, the brain is examined — not, 
of course, the same brain, but great 
numbers of similar ones, until the 
motor and sensory centers of cats, 
dogs, rats, monkeys, humans — 
and of course dolphins — become 
increasingly well-known — and un- 
derstood. 

It’s a common tale that we use 
only a fraction — some say a fourth, 
some say a tenth — of our avail- 
able brain cells. Most researchers to- 
day will not commit themselves on 
this. It is beginning to seem that 
we use all of the parts of the brain 
— but none of them at maximum 
capacity, and not all of them in 
ways which are completely under- 
stood. 

A great deal has been written 
about lysergic acid (LSD), and 
most of it irritates me to the bel- 
lowing point. There is admittedly a 
good deal of spectacular material in 


the research, but the way it is played 
up for these effects is pretty repul- 
sive. The watch-and-ward mentality 
is ever so quick to put moral val- 
ues on its use, describing it vividly 
as a sort of super goofball — and 
acting therefore as advertising 
agents in exactly the ways which 
appeal most to the goofball men- 
tality. Meanwhile one or two cru- 
sading-type groups are marching 
systematically off in directions al- 
most guaranteed to have this par- 
ticularly valuable baby thrown out 
with the bathwater, which is what 
happened to hypnotism a hundred 
years ago when it became part 
stagecraft, part practical joke, and 
part evil incarnate of the Trilby 
and Rasputin variety, until only now 
is it regaining some respectability. 

There are still some researchers 
who are doing important explora- 
tory work with LSD, and who will 
ultimately unlock the secrets of its 
strange behavior and great potency. 
That this substance, or certain ones 
allied to it, will open new pathways 
to the study and treatment of the 
mind is beyond doubt; we can only 
hope that they will be let alone to 
do it. 

One further word on hypnotism: 
here is an insight which might in- 
trigue you. Beset as it is by real and 
fictional accounts of fixed, glazed 
eyes staring at lights and glittering 
pendulums, while the soft-voice Man 
of Power lulls the subject into deep- 
er slumber, hypnotism has a hard 
time making itself known in its 
other and more widespread effects. 
We know for example, that the 
mind can direct the realization of 


HOW TO HAVE A HIROSHIMA 


69 



pain away from a specified area of 
the body under hypnosis. You’ve 
surely read of hypnotic anesthesia in 
childbirth and dentistry, and the 
stage trick of pushing a needle 
through a fold of the subject’s flesh, 
which not only is not felt, but does 
not bleed. But has it ever occurred 
to you that your own body, right 
this very minute, is performing the 
same trick of anesthesia? (I use the 
word in the sense of “lack of sen- 
sation” and not that of “lack of 
pain”.) Got your socks on, friend? 
Well, either they are pulled up tight 
and pressing against your calves 
or they hang down sloppy and you 
can feel the soft folds around your 
ankles. Right? But you didn’t feel 
those things before you started to 
read this page, did you? Not until 
your mind and yours truly got to- 
gether to make the sense impres- 
sions come through. 

The mind is there and the nerves 
are there and the stimulus is there 
— but the mind automatically 
switches off the recognition of most 
sense impressions until it is told, in 
some way or another, to switch it 
on again. You want another? Sit 
absolutely still with your hands on 
this page (close your eyes if you 
like) and let yourself become aware 
of your hairline in the back, be- 
ginning just behind your left ear and 
slowly working around your nape 
until you reach a point just behind 
your right ear. Not only will you 
find yourself aware of almost every 
point alone the way, you will almost 
certainly develop an itch so sudden 
and penetrating that it will be im- 
possible for you not to scratch it 


If you are one of those who resist 
suggestion, you will scratch it any- 
way but you will not know you are 
doing it. Watch yourself, now! 

T he point I am making here is 
that in this sense most of us are 
“hypnotized’* over most of our bod- 
ies most of the time, and old Soft 
Voice swinging his gold watch on 
its glittering chain hadn’t one damn 
thing to do with it. 

On the apparently sound theory 
that anything once experienced is 
never forgotten, men work today on 
ways to bring back, or bring out, 
“forgotten material. This could 
lead to eidetic, or “camera” mem- 
ory — a handy thing not only in 
psychotherapy, but in a court of 
law. Studies are being made on the 
extraordinary metabolism of the 
brain cells, which seem to use blood 
fractions physically and chemically* 
in different ways from other body 
cells. And aside from these and oth- 
er researches on the organic activity 
of the brain, many profound and 
widely varied studies are being 
made on brain function — that is, 
behavior: the learning process, for 
example, and psychosomatic illness. 

All this barely dusts over the 
surface of what’s being done — and 
I haven’t even touched the quag- 
mires of ESP! So: you don’t — you 
just don't — turn so many tools in 
so many ways on such a subject 
without coming up with a break- 
through. And when it comes, it’s 
going to change the face of our 
earth . 

Ha! You scratched!

IP ® Short Story 


WHAT 

CROOCH DID 

BY JESSE FRIED9.ANDER 

I 


M r. President, honored guest, 
members of the Athletic Com- 
mission, fellow Innovators. It gives 
me great pleasure to report that the 
year 2206 holds promise of immi- 
nent success for our cause. Our next 
annual meeting may well be in the 
form of a victory dinner! 

Through the untiring efforts of 
our organization, our national pas- 
time, which has been stagnating in 
its own rigid rules for more than a 
century, is now on the verge of de- 
veloping to its wonderful potential. 
While we still face formidable oppo- 
sition from the Traditionalists, under 
whose rule the popularity of the 
sport continues to decline, during 
the past twelve months we have made 
tremendous progress. The new sta- 
dium, for instance — or rather the 
special features tonight’s guest of 
honor, master architect Thaddeus 
Brutus, has had built into it — stands 
as tribute to our achievements. 


These new-fangled ideas — 
where will they all stop? 

Through my work as historian for 
our organization, I have discovered 
that today’s crisis is far from the first 
our national pastime has faced. The 
rare books and newspaper articles 
that have survived the wars and rav- 
ages of time reveal that, on more 
than one occasion, the sport rebound- 
ed from seeming extinction. In fact, 
it appeared doomed only a few short 
decades after its birth in the late 1 8th 
or early 19th century, when it was 
known simply as wrestling, or grunt- 
angroan. 

In its archaic form, the sport pit- 
ted two men against each other in 
a small, padded enclosure called a 
ring — facetiously, I suppose, since 
every available record indicates it 
was square in shape. 

Each contestant, armed with noth- 
ing more than some ancient skill in 
the use of leverage, would struggle 
toward the benign goal of pressing 
his opponent’s shoulders to the can- 


71 


vas flooring. Two out of three of 
these “pins” or “falls” would de- 
cide the match. 

It is easy to understand why such 
mild sport failed to become particu- 
larly popular. Actually, within half 
a century, it had all but fallen into 
oblivion when snatched from its 
deathbed by the advent of viewy — 
originally known as television, or 
TV. 

These early views machines were 
cumbersome devices, capable of cast- 
ing only two-dimensional images — 
some of them not even in color — 
on screens that were just a few inch- 
es in diameter. Wrestling, confined 
as it was by a ring, proved a natural 
for the new medium. It quickly 
claimed widespread interest, helped 
by the fact that entertainment was 
not considered suitable fare for TV 
in those days. 

However, wrestling’s basic weak- 
ness remained. It just wasn’t interest- 
ing enough. And, as the novelty wore 
off, its popularity waned. 

Promoters, in a frantic effort to re- 
kindle interest, resorted to present- 
ing one combatant as the hero and 
the other as the villain, prearranging 
the result so that good would triumph 
over evil. Reduced to such a farcical 
exhibition, deprived of any aspect of 
honest competition, once again the 
sport began a rapid decline toward 
extinction — this time to sarcastic 
cries of “author, author” after an 
obviously rehearsed match. 

This “theatrical” trend led many 
wrestlers to adopt bizarre personal- 
ities in the wild hope of capturing 
a bit of public interest. For instance, 
one affected a long, blond, highly ef- 


feminate hair-do; another dressed 
and acted the part of a full-blooded 
Indian; a third billed himself a mem- 
ber of a royal family. 

One can see why, in 1979, after 
less than a century of existence, 
wrestling was again in its last throes. 
However on September 9th of that 
year, new life was injected into the 
sport. 

T his historic occurrence took 
place during a minor bout in 
Scranton, Pennsylvania, which 
matched the second-rate talents of 
a veteran named Doc Mauler with 
those of a newcomer from the Cana- 
dian forests — Lumberjack Lenny. 

Since Mauler — who claimed a real 
medical degree — was the local con- 
testant, it was arranged that he 
should take the “match” by win- 
ning the first and third falls. Lenny, 
however, in the excitement of his 
first bout, forgot his instructions and 
unceremoniously pinned the veteran 
in a matter of minutes. When it ap- 
peared that Lenny was about to suf- 
fer a similar lapse of memory in the 
second fall, Doc Mauler called upon 
all his medical know-how and came 
up with the correct therapy for his 
opponent’s mental condition. It was 
at this precise moment that the sport 
— and Lenny — received a shot in 
the arm. 

Let me explain that, before the 
bout started, Mauler had left his 
identifying stethoscope and hypo- 
dermics on the apron, or edge of 
the ring. In that desperate moment, 
just as he was about to be pinned 
for the second time, he found these 
implements conveniently within his 


72 


IF 



reach, picked up a hypodermic nee- 
dle and jabbed it into his opponent’s 
arm. 

Lenny, sent reeling back by this 
new onslaught, retreated to his own 
corner, pausing only to gather up 
his own trademarks — a lumber jack- 
et and a two-edged axe — before re- 
engaging his adversary. 

The newspaper accounts of the 
day tell us that Mauler wisely at- 
tempted to move into close quarters, 
feinting with the hypodermic while 
trying to slip the stethoscope around 
Lenny’s neck. As he explained from 
his hospital bed after the fight, al- 
though his main objective was to 
garrote his foe, he had not over- 
looked the possibility of injecting an 
air bubble into his bloodstream. 

However, he never got the chance. 
Lenny, calling upon the experience 
of his many barroom brawls in the 
north woods, faked an opening with 
his lumber jacket, then shortened the 
fight — and Mauler’s right leg — 
with a quick backhand chop. 

Fortunately, the promoter of that 
historic match was none other than 
Eddie Crooch, whom we all revere 
today as the father of the sport. The 
audience’s truly enthusiastic response 
to this refreshing exhibition of com- 
petitive feeling did not escape 
Crooch’s shrewd eye and he lost no 
time in changing the rules of the 
sport to encompass it. 

Lumberjack Lenny and his Edu- 
cated Axe was one of the first greats 
of this new phase of the game. Al- 
though Doc Mauler never fully re- 
covered from his first encounter, his 
younger brother, Intern Izzy Maul- 
er, strung together an enviable skein 


of victories until he found himself 
outweaponed, some years later, by 
Spearfisher Frank. 

Other immortals of that era were 
Plumber Sam and his Sturdy Still- 
son Wrench, Homer Hittinger and 
his Lead-Loaded Bat, Electron Ed- 
die and his effective (if cumbersome) 
High-Voltage Generator, and Bill 
Guillotine, to name a few. 

E ven while these stars were pack- 
ing the stands, Crooch was able 
to recognize in die sport the first 
faint signs of waning popularity. 
Unlike our Traditionalists today, he 
fully realized that Innovations led to 
renewed public interest. 

His inventive mind devised the 
switch to the full-sized arena, the 
next step toward modernizing the 
sport. This was accomplished in 1977 
while the meeting on horseback of 
the White Knight and Prince Val- 
iant in a bout that matched the Le- 
thal Lance against the Singing Sword, 
the latter proving fatally short by 
about three feet. 

Acclaimed as the greatest cham- 
pion of this era, according to news- 
paper accounts, was Count Cruel, 
highly skilled in the use of mace and 
chain. However, even he fell be- 
fore the slings and arrows of the 
young upstart, Arthur the Archer. 

Arthur’s short-lived reign was 
brought to a sudden end by Car- 
bine Carl, who, in turn, was dis- 
patched by Machine Gun McGurk. 

It was this same McGurk who took 
part in the most famous match of 
all, pitting his skills against the two 
outstanding challengers of the day — 
Richard of the Nepal Flame Throw- 


WHAT CROOCH DID

er and Hand Grenade Harry. The 
brilliant careers of McGurk and 
Harry came to an equally brilliant 
end that day in a memorable battle 
which proved, among other things, 
that bulletproof glass wasn’t always. 
Aside from the deposed champion 
and Hand Grenade Harry, eighty- 
nine spectators, two officials and 
three ushers failed to survive the 
final contest of what I like to think 
of as the romantic era of the sport. 

The incident was followed by a 
Senate investigation into the mislead- 
ing labelling of glass products and a 
movement among misguided reform- 
ers to outlaw the sport. Fans and 
promoters alike turned to Crooch, 
already honored as the first Czar 
of the game, to find the solution. 
He met the challenge by appointing 
a committee of outstanding sports 
writers, businessmen and politicians 
to help create a new set of rules. 
As a result of the “Slaughterhouse 
Scandal”, as it was picturesquely 
labelled by the newspapers, a glass 
company went into bankruptcy and 
Crooch’s Gladiator Code was born. 

That Code, my research reveals, 
is virtually identical to that which 
now governs our national pastime, 
clearly showing how reactionary our 
Traditionalist opponents really are. 
Even as today, the original Code 
permitted gladiators a choice of 
nothing more lethal than a short 
sword or three-pronged spear. 
Swordsmen were to be equipped with 
shields, arm and leg guards, breast 
plates and helmets, all of light metal. 
Spearmen, who sacrificed protection 
for mobility, were also provided with 


fish nets with which to confound and 
entangle opponents. Then as now, 
although the majority of fans watch- 
ed the combats on views, only those 
present at the arena were permitted 
to give the “Thumbs Up” or 
“Thumbs Down” sign. 

While combats still make pleas- 
ant enough fare for a Sunday after- 
noon, the repetition throughout the 
years has sapped it of its original zest 
and crowd appeal. Certainly you will 
agree with me that Crooch, the great- 
est Innovator of them all, would not 
have let the sport decline as it has 
for lack of inventiveness. We do not 
seek to ban the Traditional Com- 
bats. With all its pageantry it might 
well serve as an interesting prelim- 
inary event for our Innovation . 
that great Innovation which, I pre- 
dict with complete confidence, will 
be adding a fascinating new dimen- 
sion to the sport within the year. 

And now, it gives me great pleas- 
ure to introduce our guest speaker, 
the brilliant young architect who 
designed the new stadium — which in- 
cidentally, he has named the Colise- 
um after a famous 20th Century edi- 
fice. It was his foresight and confi- 
dence in the ultimate adoption of our 
Innovation which led him to include 
in his plans the tunnels under the 
stands. Tunnels that lead to the arena 
floor through heavy wooden doors at 
one end, and to chambers closed off 
by iron bars at the other. These pas- 
sageways, while too low for a man 
to walk through, are just right for 
lions. 

And now I give you .

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet ... 


Dear Editor: 

Your January cover was the most 
unusual I have ever seen on any 
magazine, but you might do better 
to put the picture in the upper 
right-hand corner where it is more 
noticeable on the magazine rack. 

I suppose you realize what the 
reaction of a less-than-longtime im- 
aginative fiction fan would be to 
Waterspider. Now I know for sure 
what you are doing with If. — Ir- 
vin Koch, 835 Chattanooga Bank 
Building, Chattanooga, Tennessee 
87402 .

Dear Editor: 

Your November issue was the best 
In some time — there wasn’t one 
thing in it that I didn’t like, so na- 
turally, I will itemize. 

The Governor of Glave : Now 
there’s a Retief story worthy of 
Laumer! The planetary revolution 
story is one of my favorite types, 
and although Laumer’s plot has 
been used before, he has somehow 
turned it into a great story. I do 
not mourn the loss of aliens in the 


story — all too often they are noth- 
ing but costumed Romans, Huns or 
Nazis. After all, if we are going to 
have an Attila or Hitler, an Earth- 
man can play the part better. I 
never cease to marvel at the near 
telepathic Retief, he finds out more 
than the whole CIA. 

Muck Man! A real good story. 
However, it should somehow have 
been 10 pages longer. The section 
concerning the trip back should 
have been lengthened. Anyway, 
more stories of changelings would 
be welcome by me — Mr. Dodge can 
handle a story line! 

A Better Mousetrap : Somewhere 
back when I got sick of the “we’re 
property” idea, but Mr. Brunner 
had the courtesy not to make it the 
main idea of the story. It had 
enough action in it for me not to 
feel a bit insulted about the ending. 

Second Class Citizen: It was in 
the typical Knight style, but it oc- 
curs to me that the dolphin was 
talking under water, a difficult feat 
for a mammal! 

Long Day in Court: Okay, but 


129 


looking* at it again it seems a bit 
pointless, except maybe to say, 
“Thou shalt not judge thy BEMish 
neighbors/' 

There is nothing I can say about 
The Reef 8 of Space that would not 
bring me into the realm of supera- 
tives! More power to ye, Pohl and 
Williamson. 

One final question, any hope for 
an anthology? You've reached that 
height! — David Lebling, 3 Rollins 
Ct., Rockville, Md. 20852.

Dear Editor: 

Your November cover makes the 

second artistic inspiration you've 

published in a row — far above 

your usual standard. The new logo 

appeals to me; because it seems 

more dignified, I suppose. The cover 

story was the best in the magazine 

and one of the best you've published 

in some time. But tell me — is 

Fremont Dodge a pseudonym for 

Jack Vance? The styles seem almost 

identical. — Jim Harkness, 112 West 

Harding, Greenwood, Mississippi. 

•Nope. — Editor. 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

Yep, Retief is still a winner! Mr. 
Laumer's stories draw me to If 
since I make it a practice never to 
buy sf mags with a serial. In this 
case the serial was so interesting 
that I searched out and found back 
issues for the rest of it. 

I must say that your If has some 
of the flavor of the 1940's that has 
been sadly lost. — T/Sgt. Jeff Tis- 
dale, 2127 Comm Sqdn, Box 1111, 

APO 328, San Francisco, California.

Dear Editor: 

First I must congratulate you on 
your new magazine, Worlds of To- 


morrow. I think the two issues of 
Worlds of Tomorrow that I have 
read are better than any single is- 
sue of either If or Galaxy. There 
are a couple of points I must make 
about the distribution of all your 
magazines in Australia, however. I 
have just finished reading the Sep- 
tember issue of If, while W of T. 
for August hasn't appeared on the 
newsstands here yet. Another thing 
is the price. In American If is sold 
for 40 cents, W. of T for 50 cents, 
which is 25 per cent more. In Aus- 
tralia, I can buy If for 3/ - while 
W of T costs 6/ -, TWICE as much. 

Your September issue has a 
lot of top-line names in it, and their 
stories live up to expectations. This 
is one of the best issues in some 
time, but certainly expected with 
names like Van Vogt, Leinster, del 
Rey, Pohl, Williamson and Stur- 
geon. Keep up this standard in If, 
please, and I will certainly stay a 
regular reader. A welcome sight 
has been the names of some British 
authors on your contents page — 
John Brunner and Brian W. Aldiss. 
More, please! — A. G. Thomas, 
Boldrewood, New Line Road, West 
Pennant Hills, N.S.W., Australia. 

• More? Well, how about this is- 
sue's “first" — Jo Friday, a young 
lady who teaches science in Aus- 
tralia, and writes about as well as 
any heretofore-unpublished writer 
we've seen in a long time. We also 
have another “first" — or, in this 
case, almost “first," since the writer 
has been published a time or two in 
in other fields, though not with 
science fiction, in Jesse Friedlander. 

By the way, notice who's leading 
off our next issue? Name's E. E. 
Smith, Ph.D. And the story is a 
winner! — Editor.

12 famous authors start a 
new kind of writing school 


If you have writing talent worth developing, 
here’s an opportunity never before available: 

Twelve of America’s most famous authors 
have created a school of professional writing 
to help you develop your skill, talent and 
craftsmanship . and to pass on to you their 
secrets of achieving success and recognition. 

This unique home-training program is su- 
pervised by Rod Serling, winner of five Em- 
mys for TV writing; Pulitzer Prize historian 
Bruce Catton; best-selling novelist Faith 
Baldwin; humorist Max (Dobie Gillis) Shul- 
man; publisher-columnist Bennett Cerf; 
famed sportswriter Red Smith; Rudolf Flesch, 
top authority on readable writing; noted lan- 
guage expert Prof. Bergen Evans; famous 
mystery novelist Mignon G. Eberhart; J. D. 
Ratcliff, called by Time “America’s No. 1 
craftsman in the field of non-fiction’’; and 
top ad men John Caples and Mark Wiseman. 

These famous authors have developed q 
remarkable series of textbooks, lessons and 
writing assignments that present — in a clear 
and stimulating way — what they have learned 
in their long, hard climb to the top. 

The School’s instructors are themselves 
professional writers. Under the supervision 
of the 12 Famous Writers, these instructors 
work with students by mail, just as magazine 
and book editors work with many established 
authors. And they spend up to several hours 


on each assignment completed by a student 
. revising, correcting, and advising. 

The Famous Writers School is less than 
three years old. Its first students are not due 
to graduate until later this year. Yet, many 
have sold their writings to such varied publi- 
cations as The Reader’s Digest, Redbook , 
Popular Science, True Story. 

To select people with writing talent worth 
developing, the 12 Famous Writers have de- 
signed a revealing Talent Test. The coupon 
will bring you a copy, along with a brochure 
about the School. Your completed Test will 
be graded without charge or obligation by 
one of the School’s instructors. If your Test 
indicates writing talent, you are then eligible 
to enroll in the School. You are, however, un- 
der absolutely no obligation to do so. 


Famous Writers School 

Dept. 6392, Westport. Connecticut 

I am interested in finding out whether I have writ- 
ing talent worth developing. Please mail me, with- 
out obligation, the Famous Writers Talent Test.
