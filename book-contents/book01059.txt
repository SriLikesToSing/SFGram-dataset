THE UTTER DARK 



B ack in 1953, Alan £. Nourse, 
then a med student, followed 
up a story conference with a let* 
ter that seemed to need an answer. 
It’s now five years later and 
Nourse is a doctor and I still can’t 
think of an answer— except to run 
the letter here: 

"Our talk got me to thinking 
about the trials of medicine and 
what it’s up against This example 
is one of my favorites, since it il- 
lustrates so well that all the as- 
sorted knowledge of Man isn’t 
worth a hill of beans if Man can’t 
find a way to apply it. The case 
in point: what single exogenous 
disease kills more people today 
than any other? Cancer? Not a 
drop in the bucket. T.B.? Twaddle. 
One so outdistances all the others 
that it’s ridiculous— malaria. 

“We have in our hands the 
knowledge and specific drugs right 
now, today, to enable us to wipe 
malaria off the face of the Earth 
in exactly fourteen days, and to 
eradicate it so thoroughly that it 
would never again plague us. 

“There’s no uncompleted re- 
search involved. We have chloro- 
quin, one dose a week, to kill the 
circulatory phase of the disease. A 



cheap, easily manufactured drug. 
We have primaquin and a couple 
of other drugs which eradicate the 
tissue stages of the disease in four- 
teen days. Also cheap, safe and 
easily manufactured. And mosqui- 
toes can’t spread the disease un- 
less they find a man who has it— 
“Yet I venture to say that when 
I die, malaria will still be the num- 
ber one exogenous killer of Man.” 
Nourse has the political and eco- 
nomic problems in mind: Bamboo 
Curtain countries that wouldn’t be 
beholden to the free world, others, 
such as India, that would find even 
a one per cent reduction in deatii 
rate a disaster. “Medicine, correct- 
ly, bows out of the malaria pic- 
ture at this point. The question 
is, who takes over?” i 

The search for that solution, 
Nourse maintains, is likely to in- 
volve the Principle of Serendipity, 
a term coined by Horace Walpole 
in The Three Princes of Serendib 
(Ceylon) who displayed excep- 
tional talent for not finding what 
they were seeking, but instead 
making accidental discoveries. 
Nourse gives some serendippy 
examples:

(Continued from Pa^e 4 ) 

“Ehrlich got rung in on a grand 
crusade to And a substance that 
would be poisonous to certain pro- 
tein materials in the human body 
and leave human protein material 
untouched. The researchers were 
after any protein material that 
didn’t belong in the human body 
and, with true Germanic ambi- 
tious plodding, they started down 
the line of all — repeat: all — the 
known aniline dye by-products. 
But Ehrlich believed heavy metals 
would be a magic bullet that would 
wipe out all germ diseases. He 
didn’t And it, of course, but he 
found a magic bullet that worked 
Ane on syphilitic rabbits. But it 
wasn’t what he was after and he 
spent the rest of his life on a 
wild^oose chase. 

“As a medical student, Freud 
was assigned the job of identifying 
the active principle in some berries 
South American Indians seemed to 
enjoy. He got interested in what 
happened to the people who 
chewed it and left the discovery 
of cocaine to someone else. 

“Fleming, growing bacteria cul- 
tures, was after something that had 
nothii^ to do with the green mold 
that Aoated in and killed his 
precious bacteria. He practically 
had to have an atom bomb planted 
under him before he decided that 
perddllhun notatum, which con- 
taminated the culture, was worth 
investigatii^. 



“This past ten years has seen 
the most remarkable mushrooming 
of pharmacological discovery in 
the history of Man— yet there is 
only one single drug which has 
been predicted, compounded, puri- 
Aed and found to comply with the 
predicted performance. And this 
was some grubby insigniAcant 
drug. 

“A slight reverse: Pasteur, a 
bacteriolo^st, wandered through 
all his work on rabies immuniza- 
tion. with the conviction that it 
was just another elusive micro- 
organism like the ones the wine- 
growers were troubled with. He 
did what has been repeated only 
in the last few years: attenuating 
a virulent virus! 

“We are surroimded by unpre- 
dictable variables. Some staler 
civilization; others alter things in 
subtle ways. Extrapolation must 
be contingent on their suddenly 
popping up. How can we predict 
the unpredictable? We can’t— but 
our technologies are teaching us 
not so much to decide what to 
look for and then look for it, but 
to be able to recognize a variable 
when it appears. And the}^re ap- 
pearing all over the place. Shots 
in the utter dark pay off!” 

Serendipitously, Nourse never 
did write the story we were dis- 
cussing. He did a juvenile novel in- 
stead. And a plot discussion turns 
into an editorial. Naturally.

The Knights off Arthur 

By FREDERIK POHL 



Illustrated by MARTIN 



I 

T here was three of us — 
I mean if you count Arthur. 
We split up to avoid at- 
tracting attention. Engdahl just 
came in over the big brieve, but I 
had Arthur with me so I had to 
come the long way around. 

When I registered at the desk, 
I said I was from Chicago. You 
know how it is. If you say you’re 
from Philadelphia, it’s like say- 
ing you’re from St. Louis or 
Detroit— I mean nobody lives in 
Philadelphia any more. Shows 
how things change. A couple years 
ago, Philadelphia was all the 
fashion. But not now, and I 
wanted to make a good impression. 

I even tipped the bellboy a 
hundred and fifty dollars. I said: 
“Do me a favor. I’ve got my bag- 
gage booby-trapped—” 

“Natch,” he said, only mildly 
impressed by the bill and a half, 
even less impressed by me. 

**I mean really booby-trapped. 
Not just a burglar alarm. Besides 
die alarm, there’s a little surprise 




8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




With one suitcase as his domain, Arthur was 
desperiitely in need of armed henchmen . for 
hfs keys to a kingdom were typewriter keysl 




on a short fuse. So what I want 
you to do, if you hear the alarm go 
off, is come running. Right?” 

“And get my head blown off?” 
He slammed my bags onto the 
floor. “Mister, you can take your 
damn money and—” 

“Wait a minute, friend.” I passed 
over another hundred. “Please? 
It’s only a shaped charge. It won’t 
hurt anything except anybody who 
messes around, see? But I don’t 
want it to go off. So you come 
running when you hear the alarm 
and scare him away and—” 

“Nol” But he was less positive. 
I gave him two hundred more and 
he said grudgingly: “All right If 
I hear it Say, whaf s in there that’s 
worth all that trouble?” 

“Papers,” I lied. 

He leered. “Sure.” 

“No fooling, it’s just personal 
stuff. Not worth a penny to any- 
body but me, understand? So 
don’t get any ideas—” 

He said in an injured tone: 
“Mister, naturally the staS won’t 
bother your stuff. What kind of a 
hotel do you think this is?” 

“Of course, of course,” I said. 
But I knew he was lying, because 
I knew what kind of hotel it was. 
The staff was there only because 
being there gave them a chance 
to knock down more money than 
ffiey could make any other way. 
What other kind of hotel was 
there? 

Anyway, the way to keep the 



staff on my side was by bribery, 
and when he left I figured I had 
him at least temporarily bought. 
He promised to keep an eye on 
the room and he would be on duty 
for four more hours— which gave 
me plenty of time for my errands. 

T MADE sure Arthur was 
^ plugged in and cleaned myself 
up. They had water miming— 
New York’s very good that way; 
they always have water running. 
It was even hot, or nearly hot I 
let the shower splash over me for 
a while, because there was a lot 
of dust and dirt from the Bronx 
that I had to get off me. The way 
it looked, hardly anybody had 
been up that way since it hap- 
pened. 

I dried myself, got dressed and 
looked out the window. We were 
fairly high up— fifteenth floor. I 
could see the Hudson and the b^ 
bridge up north of us. There was 
a huge cloud of smoke comii^ 
from somewhere near the bridge 
on the other side of the river, but 
outside of that everything looked 
normal You would have thoi^t 
there were people in all those 
houses. Even the streets looked 
pretty good, until you noticed that 
hardly any of the cars were mov- 
ing. 

I opened the little bag and 
loaded my pockets with enough 
money to run my errands. At the 
door, I stopped and called over

my shoulder to Arthur : “Don’t 
worry if I’m gone an hour or so. 
I’ll be back.” 

I didn’t wait for an answer. 
That would have been pointless 
under the circumstances. 

After Philadelphia, this place 
seemed to be bustling with ac- 
tivity. There were four or five 
people in the lobby and a couple 
of dozen more out in the street 

I tarried at the desk for several 
reasons. In the first place, I was 
expecting Vem Engdahl to try to 
contact me and I didn’t want him 
messing with the luggage — not 
while Arthur might get nervous. 
So I told the desk clerk that in 
case anybody came inquiring for 
Mr. Schlaepfer, which was the 
name I was using— my real name 
being Sam Dunlap— he was to be 
told that on no accoimt was he to 
go to my room but to wait in the 
lobby; and in any case I would 
be back in an hour. 

“Sure,” said the desk clerk, 
holding out his hand. 

I crossed it with paper. “One 
other thing,” I said. “I need to buy 
an electric t3q>ewriter and some 
other stuff. Where can I get 
them?” 

“PX,” he said promptly. 

“PX?” 

“What used to be Mac3^s,” he 
explained. “You go out that door 
and turn right It’s only about a 
block. You’ll see the sign.” 

“Tlianks.” That cost me a him- 



dred more, but it was worth it 
After all, money wasn’t a problem 
—not when we had just come from 
Philadelphia. 

^X'HE big sign read “PX,” but it 
wasn’t big enough to hide an 
older sign underneath that said 
“Macy’s.” I looked it over from 
across the street 

Somebody had organized it 
pretty well. I had to admire them. 
I mean I don’t like New York— 
wouldn’t live there if you gave me 
the place— but it showed a sort of 
go-getting spirit. It was no easy 
job getting a full staff together to 
run a department store operation, 
when any city the size of New 
York must have a couple thousand 
stores. You know what I mean? 
It’s like running a hotel or any- 
thing else— how are you going to 
get people to work for you when 
they can just as easily walk down 
the street, find a vacant store and 
SEt Up their own operation? 

But Macy’s was fully manned. 
There was a guard at every door 
and a walking patrol along the 
block-front between the entrances 
to make sure nobody broke in 
through the windows. They all 
wore green armbands and uni- 
forms— well, lots of people wore 
uniforms. 

I walked over. 

“Afternoon,” I said affably to the 
guard. “I want to pick up some 
stuff. Typewriter, maybe a gun,

carry, prices marked on every- 
thing, or what is it?” 

He stared at me suspiciously. 
He was a monster; six inches taller 
than I, he must have we^ed two 
hundred and fifty pounds. He 
didn’t look very smart, which 
might explain why he was working 
for somebody else these days. But 
he was smart enough for what he 
had to do. 

He demanded: “You new in 
town?” 

I nodded. 

He thought for a minute. “All 
right, buddy. Go on in. You pick 
out what you want, see? We’ll 
straiten out the price when you 
come out.” 

“Fair enoi^h.” I started past 
him. 

He grabbed me by the arm. “No 
tricks,” he ordered. “You come 
out the same door you went in, 
imderstand?” 

“Sure,” I said, “if that’s the way 
you want it” 

That figured— one way or an- 
other: either they got a commis- 
sion, or, like everybody else, they 
lived on what they could knock 
down. I filed that for further con- 
sideration. 

Inside, the store smelled pretty 
bad. It wasn’t just rot, though there 
was plenty of that; it was musty 
and stale and old. It was dark, or 
nearly. About one light in twenty 



was turned on, in order to con- 
serve power. Naturally the esca- 
lators and so on weren’t running 
at all. 

T PASSED a counter with pen- 
cils and bail-point pens in a 
case. Most of them were gone- 
somebody hadn’t bothered to go 
around in back and had simply 
knocked the glass out— but I found 
one that worked and an old order 
pad to write on. Over by the 
elevators there was a store direc- 
tory, so I went over and checked 
it, making a list of the depart- 
ments worth visiting. 

Office Supplies would be the 
typewriter. Garden & Home was a 
good bet— maybe I could find a 
little wheelbarrow to save carry- 
ing the typewriter in my arms. 
What I wanted was one of the 
big ones where all the keys are 
solenoid-operated instead of the 
cam-and-roller arrangement— that 
was all Arthur could operate. And 
those things were heavy, as I 
knew. That was why we had 
ditched the old one in the Bronx. 

Sporting Goods— that would be 
for a gun, if there were any left 
Naturally, they were about the 
first to go after it happened, when 
everybody wanted a gun. I mean 
everybody who lived through it. 
I thought about clothes— it was 
pretty hot in New York — and 
decided I might as well take a 
look.

IVpewriter, cloliies, gun, wheel- 
barrow. I made one more note on 
the pad— try the tobacco counter, 
but I didn’t have much hope for 
that. They had used cigarettes for 
currency around this area for a 
while, until they got enough bank 
vaults open to supply big bills. It 
made cigarettes scarce. 

I turned away and noticed for 
the first time that one of the eleva- 
tors was stopped on the main flodr. 
The doors were closed, but they 
were glass doors, and although 
there wasn’t any light inside, I 
could see the elevator was full. 
There must have been thirty or 
forty people in the car when it 
happened. 

I’d been thinking that, if nothing 
else, these New Yorkers were 
pretty neat— I mean if you don’t 
count the Bronx. But here were 
thirty or forty skeletons that no- 
body had even bothered to clear 
away. 

You call that neat? Right in 
plain view on the ground floor, 
where everybody who came into 
the place would be sure to go— I 
mean if it had been on one of 
the upper floors, what difference 
would it have made? 

I began to wish we were out 
of the city. But naturally that 
would have to wait until we 
finished what we came here to do 
—otherwise, what was the point 
of coming all the way here in the 
first place? 



tobacco counter was bare. 

I got the wheelbarrow easily 
enough— there were plenty of those, 
all sizes; I picked out a nice 11^ 
red-and-yellow one with rubber- 
tired wheel. I rolled it over to 
Sporting Goods on the same floor, 
but that didn’t work out too well. 
I found a 30-30 with telescopic 
sights, only there weren’t any car- 
tridges to fit it— or anj^ing else. I 
took the gun anjrway; Engdahl 
would probably have some extra 
ammunition. 

Men’s Clothing was a waste of 
time, too — I guess these New 
Yorkers were too lazy to do 
laundry. But I foimd the t 3 i>e- 
writer I wanted. 

I put the whole load into the 
wheelbarrow, along with a couple 
of odds and ends that caught my 
eye as I passed throi^h House- 
wares, and I bumped as gently as 
I could down the shallow steps 
of the motionless escalator to the 
ground floor. 

I came down the back way, 
and that was a mistake. It led me 
right past the food department. 
Well, I don’t have to tell you what 
that was like, with all the exploded 
cans and the rats as big as poodles. 
But I found some cologne and 
soaked a handkerchief in it, and 
with that over my nose, and some 
fast footwork for the rats, I man- 
aged to get to one of the doors. 

It wasn’t the one I had come 
in, but that was all right I sized

up Hie guard. He looked smart 
enough for a little bargaining, but 
not too smart; and if I didn’t like 
his price, I could always remem- 
ber that I was supposed to go out 
the other door. 

I said: “Psst!” 

When he turned around, I said 
rapidly: “Listen, tliis isn't the way 
I came in, but if you want to do 
business, it’ll be the way I come 
out” 

He thought for a second, and 
then he smiled craftily and said: 
“All right come on.” 

Welt we hailed. The gun was 
the big thing — he wanted five 
thousand for that and he wouldn’t 
come down. The wheelbarrow he 
was willing to let go for five htm- 
dred. And the typewriter — he 
scowled at the typewriter as 
though it were contagious. 

‘What you want that for?” he 
asked 'suspiciously. I shrugged. 

‘Well—” he scratched his head— 
“a thousand?” 

I shook my head. 

“Five himdred?” 

I kept on shaking. 

“All right, all right,” he grum- 
bled. “Look, you take the other 
things for six thousand— including 
what you got in your p>ockets that 
you don’t think I know about, 
see? And I’ll throw this in. How 
about it?” 

That was fine as far as I was 
concerned, but just on principle 
I pushed him a little further. “For- 



get it,” I said. ‘Til give you fifty 
bills for the lot, take it or leave 
it Otherwise I’ll walk right down 
the street to Gimbel’s and—” 

He guffawed. 

“What’s the matter?” I de- 
manded. 

“Pal,” he said, “you kill me. 
Stranger in town, hey? You can’t 
go anyplace but here.” 

“Why not?” 

“Accoimt of there airff an3rplace 
else. See, the chief here don’t like 
competition. So we don’t have to 
worry about anybody taking their 
trade elsewhere, like— we burned 
all the other places down.” 

That explained a couple of 
things. I coimted out the money, 
loaded the stuff back in the wheel- 
barrow and headed for the Stat- 
ler; but all the time I was count- 
ing and loading, I was talking to 
Big Brainless; and by the time I 
was actually on the way, I knew 
a little more about this “chief.” 

And that was kind of important, 
because he was the man we were 
going to have to know very well. 

II 

¥ LOCKED the door of the hotel 
room. Arthur was peeping out 
of the suitcase at me. 

I said: “I’m back. I got your 
typewriter.” He waved his eye at 
me. 

I took out the little kit of elec- 
tricians’ tools I carried, tipped the 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




t3i>ewriter on its back and began 
sorting out leads. I cut them free 
from the keyboard, soldered on a 
ground wire, and began taping the 
leads to the strands of a yard of 
forty-ply multiplex cable. 

It was a slow and dull job. I 
didn’t have to worry about which 
solenoid lead went to which 
strand — Arthur could sort them 
out. But all the same it took an 
hour, pretty near, and I was get- 
ting hungry by the time I got the 
last connection taped. I shifted the 
typewriter so that both Arthur and 
I could see it, rolled in a sheet of 
paper and hooked the cable to 
Arthur’s receptors. 

Nothing happened. 

“Oh,” I said. “Excuse me, 
Arthur. I forgot to plug it in.” 

I found a wall socket. The type- 
writer began to hum and then it 
started to rattle and ty(>e: 

DURA AUK UKOO RQK 
MWS AQB 
It stopped. 

“Come on, Arthur,” I ordered 
impatiently. “Sort them out, will 
you?” 

Laboriously it typed: 

! ! ! 

Then, for a time, there was a 
clacking and thumping as he typed 
random letters, peeping out of the 
suitcase to see what he had typed, 
until the sheet I had put in was 
used up. 

I replaced it and waited, as pa- 
tiently as I could, smoking one of

the last of my c^arettes. After fif- 
teen minutes or so, he had the hang 
of it pretty well. He t3T>ed: 

YOU DAMQXXX DAMN 
FOOL WHUXXX WHY DID 
YOU LEAQNXXX LEAVE ME 
ALONE Q Q 

“Aw, Arthur,” I said. “Use your 
head, will you? I couldn’t carry 
that old typewriter of yours all 
the way down through the Bronx. 
It was getting pretty beat-up. Any- 
way, I’ve only got two hands—” 

YOU LOUSE, it rattled, ARE 
YOU TRYONXXX TRYING 
TO INSULT ME BECAUSE I 
DONT HAVE ANY QQ 

“Arthur!” I said, shocked. “You 
know better than that!” 

The typewriter slammed its 
carriage back and forth ferocious- 
ly a couple of times. Then he said : 
ALL RIGHT SAM YOU KNOW 
YOUVE GOT ME BY THE 
THROAT SO YOU CAN DO 
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO 
WITH ME WHO CARES 
ABOUT MY FEELINGS ANY- 
HOW 

“Please don’t take that atti- 
tude,” I coaxed. 

WELL 

“Please?” 

He capitulated. ALL RIGHT

“No.”

LOUSIEST ELECTRICIANS 
MATE ON THE SEA SPRITE 
AND HE ISNT MUCH BET- 
TER NOW SAY SAM REMEM- 
BER WHEN WE HAD TO GET 
HIM OUT OF THE JUG IN 
NEWPORT NEWS BECAUSE 
I settled back and relaxed. I 
might as well. That was the trouble 
with getting Arthur a new type- 
writer after a couple of days with- 
out one— he had so much garrulity 
stored up in his little brain, and 
the only person to spill it on was 
me. 

A pparently i fell asleep. 

Well, I mean I must have, be- 
cause I woke up. I had been 
dreaming I was on guard post out- 
side the Yard at Portsmouth, and 
it was night, and I looked up and 
there was something up there, all 
silvery and bad. It was a missile— 
and that was silly, because you 
never see a missile. But this was 
a dream. 

And the thing burst, like a 
Roman candle flaring out, all sorts 
of comet-trails of light, and then 
the whole sky was full of bright 
and colored snow. Little tiny flakes 
of light coming down, a mist of 
light, radiation droppii^ like dew; 
and it was so pretty, and I took 
a deep breath. And my lungs 
burned out like slow fire, and I 
coughed myself to death with the 
explosions of the missile bangii^ 
i^inst my flaming ears . 



Well, it was a dream. It proba- 
bly wasn’t like that at all— and if 
it had been, I wasn’t there to see 
it, because I was tucked away safe 
under a hundred and twenty 
fathoms of Atlantic water. All of 
us were on the Sea Sprite. 

But it was a bad dream and it 
bothered me, even when I woke up 
and found that the banging ex- 
plosions of the missile were the 
noise of Arthur’s typewriter car- 
riage crashing furiously back and 
forth. 

He peeped out of the suitcase 
and saw that I was awake. He de- 
manded: HOW CAN YOU FALL 
ASLEEP WHEN WERE IN A 
PLACE LIKE THIS Q Q ANY- 
THING COULD HAPPEN 
SAM I KNOW YOU DONT 
CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO 
ME BUT FOR YOUR OWN 
SAKE YOU SHOULDNT 
“Oh, dry up,” I said. 

Being awake, I remembered 
that I was hungry. There was still 
no sign of Engdahl or the others, 
but that wasn’t too surprising— 
they hadn’t known exactly when 
we would arrive. I wished I had 
thought to bring some food back 
to the room. It looked like long 
waiting and I wouldn’t want to 
leave Arthur alone again— after all, 
he was partly right 

I thought of the telephone. 

On the off-chance that it m^t 
work, I picked it up. Amazing, a 
voice from the desk answered. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I crossed my finders and said: 
“Room service?*^ 

And the voice answered amiably 
enough: “Hold on, buddy. I’ll see 
if they answer.” 

Clicking and a good long wait. 
Then a new voice said: “Whaddya 
want?” 

There was no sense pressing my 
luck by asking for anything like 
a complete meal. I would be lucky 
if I got a sandwich. 

I said: “Please, may I have a 
Spam sandwich on Rye Krisp and 
some coffee for Room Fifteen For- 
ty-one?” 

“Please, you go to hell!” the 
voice snarled. “What do you think 
this is, some damn delicatessen? 
You want liquor, we’ll get you 
liquor. Thafs what room service 
is for!” 

T HUNG up. What was the use 

of ai^;uing? Arthur was clacking 
peevishly: 

WHATS THE MATTER 
SAM YOU THINKING OF 
YOUR BELLY AGAIN Q Q 

“You would be if you—” I 
started, and then I stopped. 
Arthur’s feelings were delicate 
enough already. I mean suppose 
that all you had left of what you 
were born with was a brain in a 
kind of sardine can, wouldn’t you 
be sensitive? Well, Arthur was 
more sensitive than you would be, 
believe me. Of course, it was his 
own foolish fault— I mean you 



don’t get a prosthetic tank unless 
you die by accident, or somethii^ 
like that, because if it’s disease 
they usually can’t save even die 
brain. 

The phone rang again. 

It was the desk clerk. “Say, did 
you get what you wanted?” he 
asked chummily. 

“No.” 

“Oh. Too bad,” he said, but 
cheerfully. “Listen, buddy, I for- 
got to tell you before. That Miss 
Engdahl you were expecting, she’s 
on her way up.” 

I dropped the phone onto the 
cradle. 

“Arthur!” I yelled. “Keep quiet 
for a while— trouble!” 

He clacked once, and the type- 
writer shut itself off. I jumped 
for the door of the bathroom, curs- 
ing the fact that I didn’t have 
cartri(^es for the gun. Still, empty 
or not, it would have to do. 

I ducked behind the badiroom 
door, in the shadows, covering the 
hall door. Because there were two 
things wrong with what the desk 
clerk had told me. Vem Eng- 
dahl wasn’t a “miss,” to begin with; 
and whatever name he used when 
he came to call on me, it wouldn’t 
be Vem EngdahL 

There was a knock on the door. 
I called: “Come in!” 

The door opened and the girl 
who called herself Vem Engdahl 
came in slowly, looking around. I 
stayed quiet and out of sight until 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR

she was all the way in. She didn^ 
seem to be armed; there wasn’t 
anyone with her. 

I stepped out, holding the gun 
on her. Her eyes opened wide and 
she seemed about to turn. 

“Hold it! Come on in, you. Close 
the door!” 

She did. She looked as though 
she were expecting me. I looked 
her over— medium pretty, not very 
tall, not very plump, not very old. 
I'd have guessed twenty or so, but 
that’s not my line of work; she 
could have been almost any age 
from seventeen on. 

The typewriter switched itself 
on and began to pound agitatedly. 
I crossed over toward her and 
paused to peer at what Arthur was 
yackii^ about: SEARCH HER 
YOU DAMN FOOL MAYBE 
SHES GOT A GUN 

I ordered: “Shut up, Arthur. 
I’m ^oing to search her. You! Turn 
around!” 

S HE shrugged and turned 
around, her hands in the air. 
Over her shoulder, ^e said : 
“You're taking this all wrong, Sam. 
I came here to make a deal with 
yoa” 

“Sure you did.” 

But her knowing my name was 
a blow, too. I mean what was the 
use of all that sneaking around if 
people in New York were going to 
know we were here? 

I walked up close behind her 



and patted what there was to pat 
There didn’t seem to be a gun. 

“You tickle,” she complained. 

I took her pocketbook away 
from her and went through it. No 
gun. A lot of money— an awful 
lot of money. I mean there must 
have been two or three hundred 
thousand dollars. There was 
nothing with a name on it in the 
pocketbook. 

She said: “Can I put my hands 
down, Sam?” 

“In a minute.” I thought for a 
second and then decided to do it— 
you know, I just couldn’t afford to 
take chances. I cleared my throat 
and ordered: “Take off your 
clothes.” 

Her head jerked around and she 
stared at me. ‘Whaf.^’ 

“Take them off. You heard me.” 

“Now wait a minute—” she be- 
gan dangerously. 

I said: “Do what I tell you, 
hear? How do I know you haven't 
got a knife tucked away?” 

She clenched her teeth. “Why, 
you dirty little man! What do you 
think—” Then she shrugged. She 
looked at me with contempt and 
said: “All right. Whafs the dif- 
ference?” 

Well, there was a considerable 
difference. She began to unzip and 
unbutton and wriggle, and pretty 
soon she was standing there in her 
underwear, looking at me as 
though I were a two-headed worm. 
It was interesting, but kind of em-

barrassing. I could see Arthur^s 
eye-stalk waving excitedly out of 
the opened suitcase. 

I picked up her skirt and blouse 
and shook them. I could feel my- 
self blushing, and there didn’t seem 
to be an3^ing in them. 

I growled: “Okay, I guess that’s 
enough. You can put your clothes 
back on now.” 

“Gee, thanks,” she said. 

She looked at me thoughtfully 
and then shook her head as if 
she’d never seen anjrthing like me 
before and never hoped to again. 
Without another word, she began 
to get back into her clothes. I had 
to admire her poise. I mean she 
was perfectly calm about the whole 
thing. You’d have thought she was 
used to taking her clothes off in 
front of strange men. 

Well, for that matter, maybe she 
was; but it wasn’t any of my busi- 
ness. 

A RTHUR was clacking dis- 
tractedly, but I didn’t pay any 
attention to him. I demanded: “All 
right, now who are you and what 
do you want?” 

She pulled up a stocking and 
said: “You couldn’t have asked 
me that in the first place, could 
you? I’m Vem Eng—” 

“Cut it outr 

She stared at me. “I was only 
going to say I’m Vem Engdahl’s 
partner. We’ve got a little business 
deal cooking and I wanted to talk 



to you about diis proposition.” 
Arthur squawked: WHATS 

ENGDAHL UP TO NOW Q Q 
SAM IM WARNING YOU I 
DONT LIKE THE LOOK OF 
THIS THIS WOMAN AND 
ENGDAHL ARE PROBABLY 
DOUBLECROSSING US 

I said: “All right, Arthur, relax. 
I’m taking care of things. Now 
start over, you. What’s your 
name?” 

She finished putting on her shoe 
and stood up. “Amy.” 

“Last name?” 

She shrugged and fished in her 
purse for a cigarette. “What does 
it matter? Mind if I sit down?” 
“Go ahead,” I mmbled. “But 
don’t stop talking!” 

“Oh,” she said, ‘Sve’ve got plenty 
of time to straighten things out.” 
She lit the cigarette and walked 
over to the chair by the window. 
On the way, she gave the luggage 
a good long look. 

Arthur’s eyestalk cowered back 
into the suitcase as she came close. 
She winked at me, grinned, bent 
down and peered inside. 

“My,” she said, “he’s a nice 
shiny one, isn’t he?” 

The typewriter began to clatter 
frantically. I didn’t even bother to 
look; I told him: “Arthur, if you 
can’t keep quiet, you have to ex- 
pect people to know you’re there.” 
She sat down and crossed her 
legs. “Now then,” she said. “Frank- 
ly, he’s what I came to see you

about Vem told me you had a 
pross. I want to buy it” 

The t}T>ewriter thrashed its car- 
ri£^e back and forth furiously. 

“Arthur isn’t for sale.” 

“No?” She leaned back. “Vem’s 
already sold me his interest, you 
know. And you don’t really have 
any choice. You see, I’m in charge 
of materiel procurement for the 
Major. If you want to sell your 
share, fine. If you don’t why, we 
requisition it anyhow. Do you fol- 
low?” 

I was getting irritated — at 
Vern Engdahl, for whatever the 
hell he thought he was doing; but 
at her because she was handy. I 
shook my head. 

“Fifty thousand dollars? I mean 
for your interest?” 

“No.” 

“Seventy-five?” 

“No!” 

“Oh, come on now. A hundred 
thousand?” 

It wasn’t going to make any im- 
pression on her, but I tried to ex- 
plain: “Arthur’s a friend of mine. 
He isn’t for sale.” 

CH£ shook her head. “What’s 
^ the matter with you? Engdahl 
wasn’t like this. He sold his in- 
terest for forty thousand and was 
glad to get it.” 

Clatter-clatter-clatter from Ar- 
thur. I didn’t blame him for hav- 
ing hurt feelings that time. 

Amy said in a discouraged tone : 



“Why can’t people be reasonable? 
The Major doesn’t like it when 
people aren’t reasonable.” 

I lowered the gun and cleared 
my throat. “He doesn’t?” I asked, 
cuing her. I wanted to hear more 
about this Major, who seemed to 
have the city pretty well imder his 
thumb. 

“No, he doesn’t.” She shook her 
head sorrowfully. She said in an 
accusing voice: “You out-of-town- 
ers don’t know what it’s like to 
try to run a city the size of New 
York. There are fifteen thousand 
p>eople here, do you know that? It 
isn’t one of your hick towns. And 
it’s worry, worry, worry all the 
time, trying to keep things going.” 
“I bet,” I said sympathetically. 
“You’re, uh, pretty close to the 
Major?” 

She said stiffly: “I’m not mar- 
ried to him, if that’s what you 
mean. Though I’ve had my 
chances . But you see how 
it is. Fifteen thousand people to 
run a place the size of New York! 
It’s forty men to operate the power 
station, and twenty-five on the 
PX, and thirty on the hotel here. 
And then there are the local gro- 
ceries, and the Army, and the 
Coast Guard, and the Air Force— 
though, really, that’s only two men 
-and— Well, you get the picture.” 
“I certainly do. Look, what kind 
of a guy is the Major?” 

She shrugged. “A guy.” 

“I mean what does he like?”

**Women, mostly,’* she said, her 
expression clouded. **Come on now. 
What about it?” 

I stalled. *What do you want 
Arthur for?” 

She gave me a disgusted look. 
“What do you think? To relieve 
the manpower shortage, naturally. 
There’s more work than there are 
men. Now if the Major could just 
get hold of a couple of prosthetics, 
like this thing here, why, he could 
put them in the big installations. 
This one used to be an engineer 
or something, Vem said.” 

“Well . like an engineer.” 

A MY shrugged. “So why couldn’t 
we connect him up with 
the power station? It’s been done. 
The Major knows that— he was in 
the Pentagon when they switched 
all the aircraft warning net over 
from computer to prosthetic con- 
trol. So why couldn’t we do the 
same thing with our power station 
and release forty men for other as- 
signments? This thing could work 
day, night, Sundays— what’s die 
difference when you’re just a brain 
in a sardine can?” 
Clatter-rattle-ban^. 

She looked startled. “Oh. I for- 
got he was listening.” 

“No deal,” I said. 

She said: “A hundred and fifty 
thousand?” 

A hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars. I considered that for a 
while. Arthur clattered wamingly. 



“Well,” I temporized, “I’d have 
to be sure he was getting into good 
hands—” 

The typewriter thrashed wildly. 
The sheet of paper fluttered out 
of the carriage. He’d used it up. 
Automatically I picked it up— it 
was covered with imprecations, 
self-pity and threats— and started 
to put a new one in. 

“No,” I said, bending over the 
typewriter, “I guess I couldn’t sell 
him. It just wouldn’t be right-” 

That was my mistake; it was 
the wrong time for me to say ffiat, 
because I had taken my eyes off 
her. 

The room bent over and clouted 
me. 

I half turned, not more than a 
fraction conscious, and I saw this 
Amy girl, behind me, with the 
shoe still in her hand, raised to 
give me another blackjacking on 
the skull. 

The shoe came down, and it 
must have weighed more than it 
looked, and even the fractional bit 
of consciousness went crashii^ 
away. 

Ill 

1 HAVE to tell you about Vem 
Engdahl. We were all from the 
Sea Sprite, of course — me and 
Vem and even Arthur. The thing 
about Vem is that he was the low- 
est-ranking one of us all— only an 
electricians’ mate third, I mean

when anybody paid any attention 
to things like that— and yet he was 
pretty much doing the thinking 
for the rest of us. Coming to New 
York was his idea— he told us that 
was the only place we could get 
what we wanted. 

Well, as long as we were carry- 
ing Arthur along with us, we pretty 
much needed Vem, because he 
was the one who knew how to 
keep the lash-up going. You’ve got 
no idea what kind of pumps and 
plumbing go into a prosthetic tank 
until you’ve seen one opened up. 
And, naturally, Arthur didn’t want 
any breakdowns without some- 
body around to fix things up. 

The Sea Sprite, maybe you 
know, was one of the old liquid- 
sodium-reactor subs— too slow for 
combat duty, but as big as a bam, 
so they made it a hospital ship. We 
were cruising deep when the mis- 
siles hit, and, of course, when we 
came up, there wasn’t much for a 
hospital ship to do. I mean there 
isn’t any sense fooling aroimd with 
anybody who’s taken a good deep 
breath of fallout. 

So we went back to Newport 
News to see what had happened. 
And we found out what had hap>- 
pened. And there wasn’t an3^ing 
much to do except pay off the 
crew and let them go. But us 
three stuck together. Why not? 
It wasn’t as if we had any families 
to go back to any more. 

Vem just loved all this stuff— 



heM been an Eagle Scout; maybe 
that had something to do with it— 
and he showed us how to boil 
drinking water and forage in the 
woods and all like that, because 
nobody in his right mind wanted 
to go near any kind of a town, 
until the cold weather set in, any- 
way. And it was always Vem, 
Vem, telling us what to do, iron- 
ing out our troubles. 

It worked out, except that there 
was this one thing. Vem had bright 
ideas. But he didn’t always tell us 
what they were. 

So I wasn’t so very surprised 
when I came to. I mean there I 
was, tied up, with this girl Amy 
standing over me, holding the gun 
like a club. Evidently she’d foimd 
out that there weren’t any cart- 
ridges. And in a couple of minutes 
there was a knock on the door, 
and she yelled, “Come in,” and in 
came Vem. And the man who was 
with him had to be somebody im- 
portant, because there were eight 
or ten other men crowding in close 
behind. 

I didn’t need to look at the oak 
leaves on his shoulders to realize 
that here was the chief, the fellow 
who ran this town, the Major. 

It was just the kind of thing 
Vern would do. 

ERN said, with the look on his 
face that made strange officers 
wonder why this poor persecuted 
man had been forced to spend so

much time in the brig: “Now, 
Major, I*m sure we can straighten 
all this out. Would you mind leav- 
ing me alone with my friend here 
for a moment?” 

The Major teetered on his heels, 
thinking. He was a tall, youngish- 
bald type, with a long, worried, 
horselike face. He said: “Ah, do 
you think we should?” 

“I guarantee there’ll be no 
trouble, Major,” Vern promised. 

The Major pulled at his little 
mustache. “Very well,” he said. 
“Amy, you come along.” 

“Well be right here, Major,” 
Vem said reassuringly, escorting 
him to the door. 

“You bet you will,” said the 
Major, and tittered. “Ah, bring 
that gun along with you, Amy. 
And be sure this man knows that 
we have bullets.” 

They closed the door. Arthur 
had been cowering in his suitcase, 
but now his eyestalk peeped out 
and the rattling and clattering 
from that typewriter sounded like 
the Battle of the Bulge, 

I demanded: “Come on, Vem. 
Whafs this all about?” 

Vern said : “How much did they 
offer you?” 

Clatter-bang-BANG. I peeked, 
and Arthur was saying: WARNED 
YOU SAM THAT ENGDAHL 
WAS UP TO TRICKS PLEASE 
SAM PLEASE PLEASE 
PLEASE HIT HIM ON THE 
HEAD KNOCK HIM OUT HE 



MUST HAVE A GUN SO GET 
IT AND SHOOT OUR WAY 
OUT OF HERE 

“A hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars,” I said. 

Vern looked outraged. “I only 
got forty!” 

Arthur clattered; VERN I AP- 
PEAL TO YOUR COMMON 
DECENCY WERE OLD SHIP- 
MATES VERN REMEMBER

“Still,” Vern mused, “it’s all 
common funds anyway, right? 
Arthur belongs to both of us.” 

I DONT DONT DONT RE- 
PEAT DONT BELONG TO 
ANYBODY BUT ME 

“That’s true,” I said grudging- 
ly. “But I carried him, remember.”

“You’re worrying our friend.” 
Vern shrugged impatiently.

HAVE TRUSTED YOU, Arthur 
wept. THATS ALL I MEAN TO 
YOU EH 

Vem said: “Well, Sam? Let's 
take the cash and get this thing 
over with. After all, he wilt have 
the best of treatment.” 

It was a little like selling your 
sister into white slavery, but what 
else was there to do? Besides, I 
kind of trusted Vem. 

“All right,” I said. 

What Arthur said nearly 
scorched the paper. 

Vem helped pack Arthur up 
for moving. I mean it was just 
a matter of pulling the plugs out 
and making sure he had a fresh 
battery, but Vem wanted to su- 
pervise it himself. Because one of 
the little things Vem had up his 
sleeve was that he had foimd a 
spot for himself on the Major’s 
payroll. He was now the official 
Prosthetic (Human) Maintenance 
Department Chief. 

The Major said to me: “Ah, 
Dunlap. What sort of experience 
have you had?” 

“Experience?” 

“In the Navy. Your friend Eng- 
dahl suggested you might want to 
join us here.” 

“Oh. I see what you mean.” I 
shook my head. “Nothing that 
would do you any good, I’m afraid. 
I was a yeoman.” 

“Yeoman?” 

“Like a company clerk,” I ex- 
plained. “I mean I kept records 



and cut orders and made out re- 
ports and all like that.” 

“Company clerk!” The eyes in 
the long horsy face gleamed. “Ah, 
you’re mistaken, Dunlap! Why, 
that’s just what we need. Our 
morning reports are in foul shape. 
Foul! Come over to HQ. Lieu- 
tenant Bankhead will give you a 
lift.” 

“Lieutenant Bankhead?” 

I got an elbow in my ribs for 
that. It was that girl Amy, stand- 
ing alongside me. “I,” she said, 
“am Lieutenant Bankhead.” 

Well, I went along with her, 
leaving Engdahl and Arthur be- 
hind. But I must admit I wasn’t 
sure of my reception. 

Out in front of the hotel was a 
whole fleet of cars— three or four 
of them, at least. There was a b^ 
old Cadillac that looked like a 
gangsters’ car— thick glass in the 
windows, tires that looked like 
they belonged on a truck. I was 
willing to bet it was bulletproof 
and also that it belonged to the 
Major. I was right both times. 
There was a little MG with the 
top down, and a couple of light 
trucks. Every one of them was 
painted bright orange, and every 
one of them had the star-and-bar 
of the good old United States 
Army on its side. 

It took me back to old times— 
all but the unmilitary color. Amy 
led me to the MG and pointed. 
“Sit,” she said.

I sat She got in the other side 
and we were off. 

It was a little uncomfortable on 
account of I wasn’t just sure 
whether I ought to apologize for 
making her take her clothes off. 
And then she tramped on the gas 
of that little car and I didn’t think 
much about being embarrassed or 
about her black lace lingerie. I was 
only thinking about one thing— 
how to stay alive long enough to 
get out of that car. 

IV 

CEE, what we really wanted was 
^ an ocean liner. 

The rest of us probably would 
have been happy enough to stay 
in Lehigh County, but Arthur was 
getting restless. 

He was a terrible responsibility, 
in a way. I suppose there were a 
hundred thousand people or so 
left in the country, and not more 
than forty or fifty of them were 
like Arthur— I mean if you want 
to call a man in a prosthetic tank 
a “person.” But we all did. We’d 
got pretty used to him. We’d 
shipped together in the war— and 
survived together, as a few of the 
actual fighters did, those who were 
lucky enough to be underwater or 
high in the air when the ICBMs 
landed— and as few civilians did. 

I mean there wasn’t much 
chance for surviving, for anybody 
who happened to be breathing the 



open air when it happened. I mean 
you can do just so much about 
making a “clean” H-bomb, and 
if you cut out the long-life fission 
products, the short-life ones get 
pretty deadly. 

An5Hvay, there wasn’t much 
damage, except of course that 
everybody was dead. All the sur- 
face vessels lost their crews. All 
the population of the cities were 
gone. And so then, when Arthur 
slipped on the gangplank coming 
into Newport News and broke his 
fool neck, why, we had the whole 
staff of the Sea Sprite to work on 
him. I mean what else did the 
surgeons have to do? 

Of course, that was a long time 
ago. 

But we’d stayed together. We 
headed for the farm country 
around Allentown, Pennsylvania, 
because Arthur and Vem Eng- 
dahl claimed to know it pretty 
well. I think maybe they had some 
hope of finding family or friends, 
but naturally there wasn’t any of 
that. And when you got into the 
inland towns, there hadn’t been 
much of an attempt to clean them 
up. At least the big cities and the 
ports had been gone over, in some 
spots anyway, by burial squads. 
Although when we finally decided 
to move out and went to Phila- 
delphia- 

Well, let’s be fair; there had 
been fighting around there after 
the big fight. Anyway, that wasn’t 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR 



25 




so very uncommon. That was one 
of the reasons that for a long time 
—four or five years, at any rate— 
we stayed away from big cities. 

We holed up in a big farmhouse 
in Lehigh County. It had its own 
generator from a little stream, and 
that took care of Arthur^s power 
needs; and the previous occupants 
had been just crazy about stash- 
ing away food. There was enough 
to last a century, and that took 
care of the two of us. We appre- 
ciated that We even took the old 
folks out and gave them a decent 
burial. I mean the}^d all been in 
the family car, so we just had to 
tow it to a gravel pit and push it 
in. 

The place had its own well, with 
an electric pump and a hot-water 
system— oh, it was nice. I was sor- 
ry to leave but, frankly, Arthur 
was driving us nuts. 

We never could make the tele- 
vision work— maybe there weren’t 
any stations near enough. But we 
pulled in a couple of radio stations 
pretty well and Arthur got a big 
charge out of listening to them— 
see, he could hear four or five at 
a time and I suppose that made 
him feel better than the rest of us. 

He heard that the big cities 
were cleaned up and every one of 
them seemed to want immigrants— 
they were pleading, pleading all 
the time, like the TV-set and 
vacuum-cleaner people used to in 
the old days; they guaranteed 



we’d like it if we only came to live 
in Philly, or Richmond, or Balti- 
more, or wherever. And I guess 
Arthur kind of hoped we might 
find another pross. And then— well, 
Engdahl came up with this idea 
of an ocean liner. 

It figured. I mean you get out 
in the middle of the ocean and 
what’s the difference what it’s like 
on land? And it especially ap- 
pealed to Arthur because he 
wanted to do some surface sailing. 
He never had when he was real— 
I mean when he had arms and 
legs like anybody else. He’d gone 
right into the undersea service the 
minute he got out of school 
And — well, sailing was what 
Arthur knew something about and 
I suppose even a prosthetic man 
wants to feel useful. It was like 
Amy said: He could be hooked 
up to an automated factory— 

Or to a ship. 

H Q for the Major’s Temporary 
Military Government— that’s 
what the sign said— was on the 
91st floor of the Empire State 
Building, and right there that tells 
you something about the man. I 
mean you know how much power 
it takes to run those elevators all 
the way up to the top? But the 
Major must have liked being able 
to look down on everybody else. 

Amy Bankhead conducted me 
to his office and sat me down to 
wait for His Military Excellency 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




to arrive. She filled me in on him, 
to some degree. He’d been an abso< 
lute nothing before the war; but 
he had a reserve commission in 
the Air Force, and when things 
began to look sticky, they’d called 
him up and put him in a Missile 
Master control point, underground 
somewhere up around Ossining. 

He was the duty officer when it 
happened, and naturally he hadn’t 
noticed anything like an enemy 
aircraft, and naturally the anti- 
missile missiles were still rusting 
in their racks all aroxind the city; 
but since the place had been oper- 
ating on sealed ventilation, the 
duty complement could stay there 
until the short half-life radioiso- 
topes wore themselves out. 

And then the Major found out 
that he was not only in charge 
of the fourteen men and women of 
his division at the center— he was 
ranking United States Military Es- 
tablishment officer farther than the 
eye could see. So he beat it, fast 
as he could, for New York, be- 
cause what Army officer doesn’t 
dream about being stationed in 
New York? And he set up his 
Temporary Military Government 
—and that was nine years ago. 

If there hadn’t been plenty to 
go around, I don’t suppose he 
would have lasted a week— none 
of these city chiefs would have. 
But as things were, he was in on 
the ground floor, and as new- 
comers trickled into the city, his 



boys already had things nicely or- 
ganized. 

It was a soft touch. 

W ELL, we were about a week 
getting settled in New York 
and things were looking pretty 
good. Vem calmed me down by 
pointing out that, after all, we had 
to sell Arthur, and hadn’t we come 
out of it plenty okay? 

And we had. There was no 
doubt about it. Not only did we. 
have a fat price for Arthur, which 
was useful because there were a 
lot of things we would have to buy, 
but we both had jobs working 
for the Major. 

Vem was his specialist in the 
care and feeding of Arthur and 
I was his chief of office routine— 
and, as such, I delighted his fussy 
little soul, because by adding what 
I remembered of Navy protocol 
to what he was able to teach me 
of Army routine, we came up with 
as snarled a mass of red tape as 
any field-grade officer in the whole 
history of all armed forces had 
been able to accumulate. Oh, I 
tell you, nobody sneezed in New 
York without a report being made 
out in triplicate, with eight en- 
dorsements. 

Of course there wasn’t anybody 
to send them to, but that didn’t 
stop the Major. He said with de- 
termination: “Nobod3r’s ever going 
to chew me out for non-compli- 
ance with regulations— even if I 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR 



27 




have to invent the regulations my- 
self!” 

We set up in a bachelor apart- 
ment on Central Park South— the 
Major had the penthouse; the 
whole building had been converted 
to barracks— and the first chance 
we got, Vem snaffled some trans- 
portation and we set out to find 
an ocean liner. 

See, the thing was that an ocean 
liner isn’t easy to steal. I mean 
we’d scouted out the lay of the land 
• before we ever entered the city 
itself, and there were plenty of 
liners, but there wasn’t one that 
looked like we could just jump in 
and sail it away. For that we 
needed an organization. Since we 
didn’t have one, the best thing to 
do was borrow the Major’s. 

Vem turned up with Amy Bank- 
head’s MG, and he also turned up 
with Amy. I can’t say I was dis- 
pleased, because I was beginning 
to like the girl; but did you ever 
try to ride three people in the seats 
of an MG? Well, the way to do it 
is by having one passenger sit 
in the other passenger’s lap, which 
would have been all right except 
that Amy insisted on driving. 

We headed downtown and over 
to the West Side. The Major’s 
Topographical Section— one former 
billboard artist— had prepared road 
maps with little red-ink Xs mark- 
ing the streets that were blocked, 
which was most of the streets; but 
we charted a course that would 



take us where we wanted to go. 
Thirty-fourth Street was open, and 
so was Fifth Avenue all of its 
length, so we scooted down Fifth, 
crossed over, got under the Elev- 
ated Highway and whined along 
uptown toward the Fifties. 

“There’s one,” cried Amy, point- 
ing. 

I was on Vem’s lap, so I was 
making the notes. It was a Fruit 
Company combination freighter- 
passenger vessel. I looked at Vem, 
and Vern shrugged as best he 
could, so I wrote it down; but it 
wasn’t exactly what we wanted. 
No, not by a long shot. 

CTILL, the thing to do was to 
^ survey our resources, and then 
we could pick the one we liked 
best We went all the way up to 
the end of the big-ship docks, and 
then turned and came back down, 
all the way to the Battery. It 
wasn’t pleasure driving, exactly— 
half a dozen times we had to get 
out the map and detour around 
impenetrable jams of stalled and 
empty cars— or an 5 nway, if they 
weren’t exactly empty, the people 
in them were no longer in shape 
to get out of our way. But we 
made it. 

We counted sixteen ships in 
dock that looked as though they 
might do for our purposes. We had 
to rule out the newer ones and 
the reconverted jobs. I mean, after 
all, U-235 just lasts so long, and 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




you can steam around the world 
on a walnut-shell of it, or what- 
ever it is, but you can’t store it 
So we had to stick with the ships 
that were powered widi conven- 
tional fuel— and, on consideration, 
only oil at that. 

But that left sixteen, as I say. 
Some of them, though, had suf- 
fered visibly from being left un- 
tended for nearly a decade, so that 
for our purposes they might as 
well have been abandoned in the 
middle of the Atlantic; we didn’t 
have the equipment or ambition 
to do any great amount of salvage 
work. 

The Empress of Britain would 
have been a pretty good bet, for 
instance, except that it was lying 
at pretty nearly a forty-five-degree 
angle in its berth. So was the 
United States, and so was the 
Caronia. The Stockholm was 
straight enough, but I took a good 
look, and only one tier of port- 
holes was showing above the water 
—evidently it had settled nice and 
even, but it was on the bottom 
all the same. Well, that mud 
sucks with a fine tight grip, and 
we weren’t going to try to loosen 
it. 

All in all, eleven of the sixteen 
ships were out of commission just 
from what we could see driving 
by. 

Vem and I looked at each other. 
We stood by the MG, while Amy 
sprawled her legs over the side 



and waited for us to make up our 
minds. 

“Not good, Sam,” said Vem, 
looking worried. 

I said; “Well, that still leaves 
five. There’s the Vulcania, tiie 
Cristobal—* 

“Too small.” 

“All right. The Manhattan, the 
Liberte and the Queen Elizabeth.** 

Amy looked up, her eyes 
gleaming. “Where’s the question?” 
she demanded. “Naturally, it’s the 
Queen.** 

I tried to explain. “Please, Amy. 
Leave these things to us, will 
you?” 

“But the Major won’t settle for 
anything but the best!” 

“The Afajor.^’ 

T GLANCED at Vem, who 

wouldn’t meet my eyes. “Well,” 
I said, “look at the problems, Amy. 
First we have to check it over. 
Maybe it’s been burned out— how 
do we know? Maybe the channel 
isn’t even deep enough to float it 
any more — how do we know? 
Where are we going to get the oil 
for it?” 

“We’ll get the oil,” Amy said 
cheerfully. 

“And what if the channel isn’t 
deep enough?” 

“She’ll float,” Amy promised. 
“At high tide, an5rway. Even if 
the channel hasn’t been dredged in 
ten years.” 

I shrugged and gave up. What 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR 



29 




was the use of arguing? 

We drove back to the Queen 
Elizabeth and I had to admit that 
there was a certain attraction 
about that big old dowager. We 
all got out and strolled down the 
pier, looking over as much as we 
could see. 

The pier had never been 
cleaned out. It bothered me a little 
—I mean I don’t like skeletons 
much— but Amy didn’t seem to 
mind. The Queen must have just 
docked when it happened, because 
you could still see bony queues, 
as though they were waiting for 
customs inspection. 

Some of the bags had been 
opened and the contents scattered 
around— naturally, somebody was 
bound to think of looting the 
Queen. But there were as many 
that hadn’t been touched as that 
had been opened, and the whole 
thing had the look of an amateur 
attempt. And that was all to the 
good, because the fewer persons 
who had boarded the Queen in the 
decade since it happened, the more 
chance of our finding it in usable 
shap>e. 

Amy saw a gangplank still up, 
and with cries of girlish glee ran 
aboard. 

I plucked at Vern’s sleeve. 
“You,” I said. “What’s this about 
what the Major won’t settle for 
less than?” 

He said: “Aw, Sam, I had to 
tell her something, didn’t I?” 



“But what about the Major—” 

He said patiently: “You don’t 
understand. It’s all part of my 
plan, see? The Major is the big 
thing here and he’s got a birthday 
coming up next month. Well, the 
way I put it to Amy, we’ll fix 
him up with a yacht as a birthday 
present, see? And, of course, when 
it’s all fixed up and ready to lift 
anchor — ” 

I said doubtfully: “That’s the 
hard way, Vem. Why couldn’t we 
just sort of get steam up and take 
off?” 

He shook his head. ‘‘That is the 
hard way. This way we get all die 
help and supplies we need, im- 
derstand?” 

I shrugged. That was the way 
it was, so what was the use of ar- 
guing? 

But there was one thing more 
on my mind. I said: “How come 
Amy’s so interested in making 
the Major happy?” 

Vem chortled. “Jealous, eh?” 

“I asked a question!” 

“Calm down, boy. It’s just that 
he’s in charge of things here so 
naturally she wants to keep in 
good with him.” 

I scowled. “I keep hearing 
stories about how the Major’s 
chief interest in life is women. 
You sure she isn’t ambitious to be 
one of them?” 

He said : “The reason she wants 
to keep him happy is so she won’f 
be one of them.”

V 

name of the place was 
Bayonne. 

Vern said: “One of them’s ^ot 
to have oil, Sam. It has to.” 

“Sure,” I said. 

“There’s no question about it. 
Look, this is where the tankers 
came to discharge oil. They’d come 
in here, pump the oil into the re- 
finery tanks and—” 

“Vern,” I said. “Let’s look, shall 
we?” 

He shrugged, and we hopped off 
the little outboard motorboat onto 
a landing stage. The tankers 
towered over us, rusty and screech- 
ing as the waves rubbed them 
against each other. 

There were fifty of them there 
at least, and we poked around 
them for hours. The hatches were 
rusted shut and unmanageable, 
but you could tell a lot by snif- 
fing. Gasoline odor was out; smell 
of seaweed and dead fish was out^ 
but the heavy, rank smell of fuel 
oil, that was what we were snif- 
fing for. Crews had been aboard 
these ships when the missiles 
came, and crews were still aboard. 

Beyond the two-part super- 
structures of the tankers, the sky- 
line of New York was visible. I 
looked up, sweating, and saw the 
Empire State Building and 
imagined Amy up there, looking 
out toward us. 

^he knew we were here. It was 



her idea. She had scrounged up a 
naval engineer, or what she called 
a naval engineer— he had once been 
a stoker on a ferryboat. But he 
claimed he knew what he was 
talking about when he said the 
only thing the Queen needed to 
make ’er go was oil. And so we 
left him aboard to tinker and 
polish, with a couple of helpers 
Amy detached from the police 
force, and we tackled the oil 
problem. 

Which meant Bayonne. Which 
was where we were. 

It had to be a tanker with at 
least a fair portion of its cargo 
intact, because the Queen was a 
thirsty creature, drinking fuel not 
by the shot or gallon but by the 
ton. 

“Saaam! Sam Dunlap!” 

I looked up, startled. Five ships 
away, across the U of the moor- 
ing, Vern Engdahl was bellowing 
at me through cupped hands. 

“I found it!” he shouted. “Oil, 
lots of oil! Come look!” 

I clasped my hands over my 
head and looked around. It was a 
long way around to the tanker 
Vern was on, hopping from deck 
to deck, detouring around open 
stretches. 

I shouted: “I’ll get the boat!” 

He waved and climbed up on 
the rail of the ship, his feet dan- 
gling over, looking supremely hap- 
py and pleased with himself. He 
lit a cigarette, leaned back against 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR

the upward sweep of the rail and 
waited. 

It took me a little time to get 
back to the boat and a little more 
time than that to get the damn 
motor started. Vern! “Let’s not 
take that lousy little twelve horse- 
power, Sam,” he’d said reason- 
ably. “The twenty-five’s more what 
we need!” And maybe it was, but 
none of the motors had been 
started in most of a decade, and 
the twenty-five was just that much 
harder to start now. 

I struggled over it, swearing, 
for twenty minutes or more. 

The tanker by whose side we 
had tied up began to swing toward 
me as the tide changed to out- 
going. 

"TOR a moment there, I was 

counting seconds, expecting to 
have to make a jump for it before 
the big red steel flank squeezed 
the little outboard flat against the 
piles. 

But I got it started— just about 
in time. I squeezed out of the trap 
with not much more than a yard 
to spare and threaded my way 
into open water. 

There was a large, threatening 
sound, like an enormous slow 
cough. 

I rounded the stern of the last 
tanker between me and open 
water, and looked into the eye of 
a fire-breathing dragon. 

Vem and his cigarettes! The 



tanker was loose and ablaze, bear- 
ing down on me with the slow 
drift of the ebbing tide. From the 
hatches on the forward deck, two 
fountains of fire spurted up and 
out, like enormous nostrils spout- 
ing flame. The hawsers had been 
burned through, the ship was 
adrift, I was in its path— 

And so was the frantically 
splashing figure of Vern Engdahl, 
trying desperately to swim out of 
the way in the water before it. 

What kept it from blowing up 
in our faces I will never know, 
unless it was the pressure in the 
tanks forcing the flame out; but 
it didn’t. Not just then. Not until 
I had Engdahl aboard and we 
were out in the middle of the Hud- 
son, staring back; and then it 
went up all right, all at once, like 
a missile or a volcano; and there 
had been fifty tankers in that one 
mooring, but there weren’t any 
any more, or not in shape for us 
to use. 

I looked at Engdahl. 

He said defensively: “Honest, 
Sam, I thought it was oil. It 
smelled like oil. How was I to 
know—” 

“Shut up,” I said. 

He shrugged, injured. “But it’s 
all right, Sam. No fooling. There 
are plenty of other tankers 
around. Plenty. Down toward the 
Amboys, maybe moored out in the 
channel. There must be. We’ll find 
them.”

“No,” I said. “You will.” 

And that was all I said, be- 
cause I am forgiving by nature; 
but I thoi^ht a great deal more. 

Surprisingly, though, he did find 
a tanker with a full load, the 
very next day. 

It became a question of get- 
ting the tanker to the Queen. I left 
that part up to Vern, since he 
claimed to be able to handle it. 

It took him two weeks. First 
it was finding the tanker, then it 
was locating a tug in shape to 
move, then it was finding some- 
one to pilot the tug. Then it was 
waiting for a clear and windless 
day— because the pilot he found 
had got all his experience sailing 
Star boats on Long Island Sound— 
and then it was easing the tanker 
out of Newark Bay, into the chan- 
nel, down to the pier in the North 
River— 

Oh, it was work and no fooling. 
I enjoyed it very much, because 
I didn’t have to do it. 

13 UT I had enough to keep 
me busy at that. I found a 
man who claimed he used to be 
a radio engineer. And if he was an 
engineer, I was Albert Einstein’s 
mother, but at least he knew which 
end of a soldering iron was hot. 
There was no need for any great 
skill, since there weren’t going to 
be very many vessels to commu- 
nicate with. 

Things began to move. 



The advantage of a ship like 
the Queen, for our purposes, was 
that the thing was pretty well au- 
tomated to start out with. I mean 
never mind what the seafaring 
unions required in the way of 
flesh-and-blood personnel. What it 
came down to was that one man in 
the bridge or wheelhouse could 
pretty well make any part of the 
ship go or not go. 

The engine-room telegraph 
wasn’t hooked up to control the 
engines, no. But the wiring dia- 
gram needed only a few little 
changes to get the same effect, 
because where in the original con- 
cept a human being would take a 
look at the repeater down in the 
engine room, nod wisely, and push 
a button that would make the 
engines stop, start, or whatever— 
why, all we had to do was cut 
out the middleman, so to speak. 

Our genius of the soldering iron 
replaced flesh and blood with some 
wiring and, presto, we had cen- 
tralized engine control. 

The steering was even easier. 
Steering was a matter of electronic 
control and servomotors to begin 
with. Windjammers in the old 
movies might have a man lashed 
to the wheel whose muscle power 
turned the rudder, but, believe me, 
a big superliner doesn’t. The rud- 
ders weigh as much as any old 
windjammer ever did from stem 
to stern; you have to have motors 
to turn them; and it was only a 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




matter of getting out the old sol- 
dering iron again. 

By the time we were through, 
we had every operational facility 
of the Queen hooked up to a single 
panel on the bridge. 

Engdahl showed up with the oil 
tanker just about the time we got 
the wiring complete. We rigged up 
a pump and filled the bunkers till 
they were topped off full. We 
guessed, out of hope and ignorance, 
that there was enough in there to 
take us half a dozen times around 
the world at normal cruising speed, 
and maybe there was. Anyway, 
it didn’t matter, for surely we had 
enough to take us anywhere we 
wanted to go, and then there 
would be more. 

We crossed our fingers, turned 
our ex-ferry-stoker loose, pushed a 
button— 

Smoke came out of the stacks. 

The antique screws began to 
turn over. Astern, a sort of hump 
of muddy water appeared. The 
Queen quivered underfoot. The 
mooring hawsers creaked and sang. 

“Turn her off!” screamed Eng- 
dahl. “She’s headed for Times 
Square!” 

Well, that was an exaggeration, 
but not much of one; and there 
wasn’t any sense in stirring up 
the bottom mud. I pushed buttons 
and the screws stopped. I pushed 
another button, and the big en- 
gines quietly shut themselves off, 
and in a few moments the stacks 



stopped puffing their black smoke. 

The ship was alive. 

Solemnly Engdahl and I shook 
hands. We had the thing licked. 
All, that is, except for the one 
small problem of Arthur. 

' I ^HE thing about Arthur was 
they had put him to work. 

It was in the power station, just 
as Amy had said, and Arthur 
didn’t like it. The fact that he 
didn’t like it was a splendid reason 
for staying away from there, but 
I let my kind heart overrule my 
good sense and paid him a visit 

It was way over on the East 
Side, miles and miles from any 
civilized area. I borrowed Am^s 
MG, and borrowed Amy to go 
with it, and the two of us packed 
a picnic lunch and set out There 
were reports of deer on Avenue 
A, so I brought a rifle, but we 
never saw one; and if you want 
my opinion, those reports were 
nothing but wishful thinking. I 
mean if people couldn’t survive, 
how could deer? 

We Anally threaded our way 
through the clogged streets and 
parked in front of the power sta- 
tion. 

“There’s supposed to be a 
guard,” Amy said doubtfully. 

I looked. I looked pretty care- 
fully, because if there was a guard, 
I wanted to see him. The Major’s 
orders were that vital defense in- 
stallations— such as the power sta- 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR

tion, the PX and his own barracks 
building — were to be guarded 
gainst trespassers on a shoot-on- 
sight basis and I wanted to make 
sure that the guard knew we were 
privileged persons, with passes 
signed by the Major^s own hand. 
But we couldn’t find him. So we 
walked in through the big door, 
peered around, listened for the 
sounds of machinery and walked 
in that direction. 

And then we found him; he was 
sound asleep. Amy, looking indig- 
nant, shook him awake. 

“Is that how you guard military 
property?” she scolded. “Don’t 
you know the penalty for sleep- 
ing at your post?” 

The guard said something ir- 
ritable and unhappy. I got her off 
his back with some difficulty, and 
we located Arthur. 

Picture a shiny four-gallon to- 
mato can, with the label stripped 
off, hanging by wire from the 
flashing-light panels of an electric 
computer. That was Arthur. The 
shiny metal cylinder was his pros- 
thetic tank; the wires were the 
leads that served him for fingers, 
ears and mouth; the glittering 
panel was the control center for 
the Consolidated Edison Eastside 
Power Plant No. 1. 

“Hi, Arthur,” I said, and a sudden 
ear-splitting thunderous hiss was 
his way of telling me that he knew 
I was there. 

I didn’t know exactly what it 



was he was trying to say and I 
didn’t want to; fortune spares me 
few painful moments, and I accept 
with gratitude the ones it does. 
The Major’s bo}^ hadn’t bothered 
to bring Arthur’s typewriter along 
—I mean who cares what a genera- 
tor-governor had to offer in the 
way of conversation? — so all he 
could do was blow off steam from 
the distant boilers. 

W ELL, not quite all. Light 
flashed; a bucket conveyor 
began crashingly to dump loads of 
coal; and an alarm gong began to 
pound. 

“Please, Arthur,” I begged. 
“Shut up a minute and listen, will 
you?” 

More lights. The gong rapped 
half a dozen times sharply, and 
stopped. 

I said: “Arthur, you’ve got to* 
trust Vem and me. We have this 
thing figured out now. We’ve got 
the Queen Elizabeth—” 

A shattering hiss of steam — 
meaning delight this time, I 
thought. Or anyway hoped. 

“—and it’s only a question of 
time until we can carry out the 
plan. Vem says to apologize for 
not looking in on you—” hiss— “but 
he’s been busy. And after all, you 
know it’s more important to get 
eveiything ready so you can get 
out of this place, right?” 

“Psst,” said Amy. 

She nodded briefly past my 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




shoulder. I looked, and diere was 
the guard, looking sleepy and surly 
and definitely suspicious. 

I said heartily: **So as soon as 
I fix it up with the Major, we’ll 
arrange for something better for 
you. Meanwhile, Arthur, you’re 
doing a capital job and I want you 
to know that all of us loyal New 
York citizens and public servants 
deeply appreciate—” 

Thundering crashes, bangs, 
gongs, hisses, and the scream of a 
steam whistle he’d found some- 
where. 

Ardiur was mad. 

“So long, Arthur,” I said, and 
we got out of there— just barely 
in time. At the door, we foimd that 
Arthur had reversed the coal 
scoops and a growing mound of 
it was pouring into the street where 
we’d left the MG parked. We got 
the car started just as the heap 
was beginning to reach the bum- 
pers, and at that the paint, would 
never again be the same. 

Oh, yes, he was mad. Z could 
only hope that in the long run he 
would forgive us, since we were 
acting for his best interests, after 
all. 

Anyway, I thought we were. 

CTILL, things worked out pretty 
^ well— especially between Amy 
and me. Engdahl had the theory 
that she had been dodging the 
Major so long that anybody looked 
good to her, which was hardly 



flattering. But ^e and I were 
getting along right weU. 

She said worriedly: “The only 
thing, Sam, is that, frankly, the 
Major has just about made up his 
mind that he wants to marry me—” 
“He is married!” I yelped. 
“Naturally he’s married. He’s 
married to — so far — one hundred 
and nine women. He’s been hitting 
off a marriage a month for a good 
many years now and, to tell you 
the truth, I think he’s got the habit 
Anyway, he’s got his eye on me.” 
I demanded jealously: “IZas he 
said anything?” 

She picked a sheet of onionskin 
paper out of her bag and handed 
it to me. It was marked Top 
Secret, and it really was, because 
it hadn’t gone through his regular 
office— I knew that because I was 
his regular office. It was only two 
lines of text and sloppily t}^ped 
at that: 

Lt Amy Bankhead will report 
to HQ at 1700 hours 1 July to 
carry out orders of the Com- 
manding Officer. 

The first of July was only a 
week away. I handed the orders 
back to her. 

“And the orders of the Com- 
manding Officer will be — ” I 
wanted to know. 

She nodded. “You guessed it** 
I said: “We’ll have to work 
fast.” 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR

O N tile thirtietii of June, we 
invited the Major to come 
aboard his palatial new yacht. 

“Ah, thank you,” he said grate- 
fully. “A surprise? For my birth- 
day? Ah, you loyal members of 
my command make up for all that 
I’ve lost— all of it!” He nearly 
wept. 

I said: “Sir, the pleasure is all 
ours,” and backed out of his pres- 
ence. What’s more, I meant every 
word. 

It was a select party of slightly 
over a hundred. All of the wives 
were there, barring twenty or thir- 
ty who were in disfavor— still, that 
left over eighty. The Major 
brought half a dozen of his favorite 
officers. His bodyguard and our 
crew added up to a total of thirty 
men. 

We were set up to feed a hun- 
dred and fifty, and to provide 
liquor for twice that many, so it 
looked like a nice friendly brawl. 
I mean we had our radio operator 
handing out highballs as the guests 
stepped on board. The Major was 
touched and delighted; it was 
exactly the kind of party he liked. 

He came up the gangplank with 
his face one great beaming smile. 
“E^t! Drink!” he cried. “Ah, and 
be merry!” He stretched out his 
hands to Amy, standing by behind 
the radio op. “For tomorrow we 
wed,” he added, and sentimentally 
kissed his proposed bride. 

I cleared my throat. “How about 



inspecting the ship, Major?” I in- 
terrupted. 

“Plenty of time for that, my 
boy,” he said. “Plenty of time for 
that.” But he let go of Amy and 
looked around him. Well, it was 
worth looking at. Those English- 
men really knew how to build a 
luxury liner. God rest them. 

The girls began roaming around. 
It was a hot day and late after- 
noon, and the girls began discard- 
ing jackets and boleros, and that 
began to annoy the Major. 

“Ah, cover up there!” he or- 
dered one of his wives. “You too 
there, what’s-your-name. Put that 
blouse back on!” 

It gave him something to think 
about. He was a very jealous man, 
Amy had said, and when you stop 
to think about it, a jealous man 
with a hundred and nine wives to 
be jealous of really has a job. Any- 
way, he was busy watching his 
wives and keeping his military 
cabinet and his bodyguard busy 
too, and that made him too busy 
to notice when I tipped the high 
sign to Vem and took off. 

VI 

T N Consolidated Edison’s big 
power plant, the guard was 
friendly. “I hear the Major’s over 
on your boat, pal. Big doings. Got 
a lot of the girls there, hey?” 

He bent, sniggering, to look at 
my pass. 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




**Thafs right, pal,** I said, and 
slugged him. 

Arthur screamed at me with a 
shrill blast of steam as I came in. 
But only once. I wasn’t there for 
conversation. I began ripping apart 
his comfy little home of steel 
braces and copper wires, and it 
didn’t take much more than a 
minute before I had him free. And 
that was very fortunate because, 
although I had tied up the guard, 
I hadn’t done it very well, and it 
was just about the time I had 
Arthur’s steel case tucked under 
my arm that I heard a yelling and 
bellowing from down the stairs. 

The guard had got free. 

“Keep calm, Arthur!” I ordered 
sharply. “We’ll get out of this, 
don’t you worry!” 

But he wasn’t worried, or any- 
way didn’t show it, since he 
couldn’t. I was the one who was 
worried. I was up on the second 
floor of the plant, in the control 
center, with only one stairway go- 
ing down that I knew about, and 
that one thoroughly guarded by 
a man with a grudge against me. 
Me, I had Arthur, and no weapon, 
and I hadn’t a doubt in the world 
that there were other guards 
around and that my friend would 
have them after me before long. 

Problem. I took a deep breath 
and swallowed and considered 
jumping out the window. But it 
wasn’t far enough to the ground. 

Feet pounded up tiie stairs. 



more than two of them. With 
Arthur dragging me down on one 
side, I hurried, fast as I could, 
along the steel galleries that sur- 
rounded the biggest boiler. It was 
a nice choice of alternatives— if I 
stayed quiet, they would find me; 
if I ran, they would hear me, and 
then find me. 

But ahead there was — what? 
Something. A flight of stairs, it 
looked like, going out and, yes, up. 
Up? But I was already on the 
second floor. 

“Hey, you!” somebody bellowed 
from behind me. 

I didn’t stop to consider. I ran. 
It wasn’t steps, not exactly; it was 
a chain of coal scoops on a long 
derrick arm, a moving bucket ar- 
rangement for unloading fuel from 
barges. It did go up, though, and 
more important it went out The 
bucket arm was stretched across 
the clogged roadway below to a 
loading tower that hung over the 
water. 

If I could get there, I might 
be able to get down. If I could get 
down— yes, I could see it; there 
were three or four mahogany 
motor launches tied to the foot of 
the tower. 

And nobody around. 

I looked over my shoulder, and 
didn’t like what I saw, and scut- 
tled up that chain of enormous 
buckets like a roach on a wash- 
board, one hand for me and one 
hand for Arthur. 



THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR

^^HANK heaven, I had a good 
lead on my pursuers— I needed 
it I was on the bucket chain while 
they were still almost a city block 
behind me, along the galleries. I 
was halfway across the roadway, 
afraid to look down, before they 
reached the butt end of the chain. 

Clash-clatter. Clank! The bucket 
under me jerked and clattered and 
nearly threw me into the street 
One of those jokers had turned on 
the conveyor! It was a good trick, 
all right but not quite in time. I 
made a flying jump and I was on 
the tower. 

I didn’t stop to thumb my nose 
at them, but I thought of it. 

I was down those steel steps, 
breathing like a spouting whale, 
in a minute flat and jumping out 
across the concrete, coal-smeared 
yard toward the moored laimches. 
Quickly enough, I guess, but with 
nothing at all to spare, because al- 
though I hadn’t seen anyone 
there, there was a guard. 

He popped out of a doorway, 
blinking foolishly; and overhead 
the guards at the conveyor belt 
were screaming at him. It took him 
a second to figure out what was 
going on, and by that time I was 
in a launch, cast off the rope, 
kicked it free, and fumbled for 
die starting button. 

It took me several seconds to 
realize that a rope was required, 
that in fact there was no button; 
and by then I was floating yards 



away, but the pudgy pop-eyed 
guard was also in a launch, and he 
didn’t have to fiimble. He knew. 
He got his motor started a frac- 
tion of a second before me, and 
there he was, coming at me, set 
to ram. Or so it looked. 

I wrenched at the wheel and 
brought the boat hard over; but 
he swerved too, at the last mo- 
ment, and brought up something 
that looked a little like a spear 
and a little like a sickle and turned 
out to be a boathook. I ducked, 
just in time. It sizzled over my 
head as he swung and crashed 
against the windshield. Hunks of 
safety glass splashed out over the 
forward deck, but better that than 
my head 

Boathooks, hey? I had a boat- 
hook tool If he didn’t have another 
weapon, I was perfectly willii^ 
to play; I’d been sitting and taking 
it long enough and I was very 
much attracted by the idea of 
fighting back. The guard recovered 
his balance, swore at me, fought 
the wheel around and came back. 

We both curved out toward the 
center of the East River in in- 
tersecting arcs. We closed. He 
swung first I ducked— 

And from a crouch, while he 
was off balance, I caught him in 
the shoulder widi the hook. 

He made a m^ty splash. 

I throttled down die motor long 
enough to see diat he was still con- 
scious.

“Touche, buster,” I said, and set 
course for die return trip down 
around the foot of Manhattan, 
back toward the Queen. 

TT took a while, but that was 
all right; it gave everybody a 
nice long time to get plastered. I 
sneaked aboard, carrying Arthur, 
and turned him over to Vem. Then 
I rejoined the Major. He was 
making an inspection tour of the 
ship— what he called an inspection, 
after his fashion. 

He peered into the engine 
rooms and said: “Ah, fine.” 

He stared at the generators that 
were turning over and nodded 
when I explained we needed them 
for power for lights and every- 
thing and said: “Ah, of course.” 

He opened a couple of state- 
room doors at random and said: 
“Ah, nice.” 

And he went up on the flying 
bridge with me and such of his 
officers as still could walk and 
said: “Ah.” 

Then he said in a totally dif- 
ferent tone: “What the devil’s the 
matter over there?” 

He was staring east through the 
muggy haze. I saw right away 
what it was that was bothering him 
—easy, because I knew where to 
look. The power plant way over 
on the East Side was billowing 
smoke. 

“Where’s Vem Engdahl? That 
gadget of his isn’t working right!” 



“You mean Artiiur?” 

“I mean that brain in a bottle. 
It’s Engdahl’s responsibility, you 
know!” 

Vem came up out of the wheel- 
house and cleared his throat 
“Major,” he said earnestly, “I 
think there’s some trouble over 
there. Maybe you ought to go 
look for yourself.” 

“Trouble?” 

“I, uh, hear there’ve been power 
failures,” Vern said lamely. “Don’t 
you think you ought to inspect it? 
I mean just in case there’s some- 
thing serious?” 

The Major stared at him 
frostily, and then his mood 
changed. He took a drink from the 
glass in his hand, quickly finish- 
ing it off. 

“Ah,” he said, “hell with it. 
Why spoil a good party? If there 
are going to be power failures, 
why, let them be. That’s my 
motto!” 

Vern and I looked at each other. 
He shrugged slightly, meaning, 
well, we tried. And I shrugged 
slightly, meaning, what did you 
expect? And then he glanced up- 
ward, meaning, take a look at 
whaf s there. 

But I didn’t really have to look 
because I heard what it was. In 
fact, I’d been hearing it for some 
time. It was the Major’s entire air 
force — two helicopters, swirling 
around us at an average altitude of 
a hundred feet or so. They showed

up bright against the gathering 
clouds overhead, and I looked at 
them with considerable interest— 
partly because I considered it an 
even-money bet that one of them 
would be playing crumple-fender 
with our stacks, partly because I 
had an idea that they were not 
there solely for show. 

I said to the Major: “Chief, 
aren’t they coming a little close? 
I mean it’s your ship and all, but 
what if one of them takes a spill 
into the bridge while you’re here?” 

He grinned. “They know better,” 
he bragged. “Ah, besides, I want 
them close. I mean if anything 
went wrong.” 

I said, in a tone that showed as 
much deep hurt as I could 
manage: “Sir, what could go 

wrong?” 

“Oh, you know.” He patted my 
shoulder limply. “Ah, no offense?” 
he asked. 

I shook my head. “Well,” I said, 
“let’s go below.” 

A LL of it was done carefully, 
carefully as could be. The 
only thing was, we forgot about 
the tjT>ewriters. We got every- 
body, or as near as we could, into 
the Grand Salon where the food 
was, and right there on a table at 
the end of the hall was one of the 
typewriters clacking away. Vem 
had rigged them up with rolls of 
paper instead of sheets, and may- 
be that was ingenious, but it was 



also a headache just then. Because 
the typewriter was banging out: 
LEFT FOUR THIRTEEN

ONE BOILERS WITH A FULL 
HEAD OF STEAM AND THE 
SAFETY VALVES LOCKED 
BOY I TELL YOU WHEN 
THOSE THINGS LET GO 
YOURE GOING TO HEAR A 
NOISE THATLL KNOCK 
YOUR HAT OFF 

The Major inquired politely: 
“Something to do with the ship?” 
“Oh, that,” said Vern. “Yeah. 
Just a little, uh, something to do 
with the ship. Say, Major, here’s 
the bar. Real scotch, see? Look 
at the label!” 

The Major glanced at him with 
faint contempt— well, he’d had the 
pick of the greatest collection of 
high-priced liquor stores in ffie 
world for ten years, so no wonder. 
But he allowed Vern to press a 
drink on him. 

And the t3^writer kept rattling:

the T/O; it was only coincidence 
that the Major had married them 
all— were staring at the typewriter. 

“Drinks!” Vern called nervously. 
“Come on, girls! Drinks!” 

^T^HE Major poured himself a 
stiff shot and asked: “What is 
that thing? A telet5T5e or some- 
thing?” 

“That’s right,” Vem said, trail- 
ing after him as the Major wan- 
dered over to inspect it. 

I GIVE THOSE BOILERS 
ABOUT TEN MORE MIN- 
UTES SAM WELL WHAT 
ABOUT IT Q Q READY TO

The Major said, frowning faint- 
ly: “Ah, that reminds me of some- 
thing. Now what is it?” 

“More scotch?” Vern cried. 
“Major, a little more scotch?” 
The Major ignored him, scowl- 
ing. One of the “clerks, typists” 
said: “Honey, you know what it 
is? It’s like that pross you had, 
remember? It was on our wedding 
night, and you’d just got it, and 
you kept asking it to tell you 
limericks.” 

The Major snapped his fin- 
gers. “Knew I’d get it,” he glowed. 
Then abruptly he scowled again 
and turned to face Vem and me. 
“Say— ”he began. 

I said weakly: “The boilers.” 
The Major stared at me, then 
glanced out the window. “What 
boilers?” he demanded. “It’s just 



a thunderstorm. Been building up 
all day. Now what about this? Is 
that thing—” 

But Vern was paying him no 
attention. “Thunderstorm?” he 
yelled. “Arthur, you listening? Are 
the helicopters gone?” 
YESYESYES 

“Then shove off, Arthur! Shove 
off!” 

The typewriter rattled and 
slammed madly. 

The Major yelled angrily: 
“Now listen to me, you! I’m 
asking you a question!” 

But we didn’t have to answer, 
because there was a thmmming 
and a throbbing underfoot, and 
then one of the “clerks, typists” 
screamed: “The dock!” She 

pointed at a porthole. “It’s 
moving!” 

ELL, we got out of there— 
barely in time. And then it 
was up to Arthur. We had the 
whole ship to roam aroimd in 
and there were plenty of places 
to hide. They had the whole ship 
to search. And Arthur was the 
whole ship. 

Because it was Arthur, all right, 
brought in and hooked up by 
Vern, attained to his greatest 
dream and ambition. He was skip- 
per of a superliner, and more than 
any skipper had ever been— the 
ship was his body, as the prosthetic 
tank had never been; the keel his 
belly, the screws his feet, the en-

water past the moored lightship. 

We were off! 

Well, from there on, it was easy. 
We let Arthur have his fun with 
the Major and the bodyguards— 
and by the sodden, whimpering 
shape they were in when they 
came out, it must really have been 
fun for him. There were just the 
three of us and only Vern and I 
had guns— but Arthur had the 
Queen Elizabeth, and that put the 
odds on our side. 

We gave the Major a choice: 



row back to Coney Island — we 
offered him a boat, free of charge 
—or come along with us as cabin 
boy. He cast one dim-eyed look 
at the hundred and nine “clerks, 
typists” and at Amy, who would 
never be the hundred and tenth. 

And then he shru^ed and, 
game loser, said: “Ah, why not? 
I’ll come along ” 

A ND why not, when you come 
to think of it? I mean ruling 
a city is nice and all that, but a

sea voyage is a refreshing change. 
And while a hundred and nine to 
one is a respectable female-male 
ratio, still it must be wearing; and 
eighty to thirty isn’t so bad, either. 
At least, I guess that was what 
was in the Major’s mind. I know it 
was what was in mine. 

And I discovered that it was in 
Amy’s, for the first thing she did 
was to march me over to the type- 
writer and say: “You’ve had it, 
Sam. We’ll dispose with the wed- 
ding march— just get your friend 
Arthur here to marry us.” 

“Arthur?” 

“The captain,” she said. “We’re 
on the high seas and he’s em- 
powered to perform marriages.” 



Vem looked at me and shrugged, 
meaning, you asked for tiiis one, 
boy. And I looked at him and 
shrugged, meaning, it could be 
worse. 

And indeed it could. We’d got 
our ship; we’d got our ship’s com- 
pany — because, naturally, there 
wasn’t any use stealing a big ship 
for just a couple of us. We’d had 
to manage to get a sizable colony 
aboard. That was the whole idea. 

The world, in fact, was ours. It 
could have been very much worse 
indeed, even though Arthur was 
laughing so hard as he performed 
the ceremony that he jammed up 
all his keys.

THE HATED 



By PAUL FLEHR 

After space, there was always 
one more river to cross • • • the 
far side of hatred and murderl 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCES 



T he bar didn’t have a name. 
No name of any kind. Not 
even an indication that it 
had ever had one. All it said on the 
outside was: 

Cafe 

EAT 

Cocktails 

which doesn’t make a lot of sense. 
But it was a bar. It had a big TV 
set going ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta in three 
glorious colors, and a jukebox that 



tried to drown out the TV with 
that lousy music they play. Any- 
way, it wasn’t a kid hangout I 
kind of like it. But I wasn’t sup> 
posed to be there at all; it’s in the 
contract I was supposed to stay 
in New York and the New Eng- 
land states. 

Cafe-EAT-CocIctai/s was right 
across the river. I think the name 
of the place was Hoboken, but 
I’m not sure. It all had a kind 
of dreamy feeling to it. I was— 

Well, I couldn’t even remember 



THE HATED 



47 





going there. I remembered one 
minute I was downtown New 
York, looking across the river. I 
did that a lot. And then I was 
there. I don’t remember crossing 
the river at all. 

I was drunk, you know. 

VT" OU know how it is? Double 
bourbons and keep them com- 
ing. And after a while the barten- 
der stops bringing me the ginger 
ale because gradually I forget to 
mix them. I got pretty loaded long 
before I left New York. I realize 
that. 1 guess I had to get pretty 
loaded to risk the pension and all. 

Used to be I didn’t drink much, 
but now, I don’t know, when I 
have one drink, I get to thinking 
about Sam and Wally and Chow- 
derhead and Gilvey and the cap- 
tain. If I don’t drink, I think about 
them, too, and then I take a drink. 
And that leads to another drink, 
and it all comes out to the same 
thing. Well, I guess I said it al- 
ready, I drink a pretty good 
amoimt, but you can’t blame me. 

There was a girl. 

I always get a girl someplace. 
Usually they aren’t much and this 
one wasn’t either. I mean she was 
probably somebody’s mother. She 
was around thirty-five and not so 
bad, though she had a long scar 
under her ear down along her 
throat to the little round spot 
where her larynx was. It wasn’t 
ugly. She smelled nice— while I 



could still smell, you know— and 
she didn’t talk much. I liked that 
Only- 

Well, did you ever meet some- 
body with a nervous cough? Like 
when you say something funny— 
a little funny, not a big yock— 
they don’t laugh and they don’t 
stop with just smiling, but they 
sort of cough? She did that. I be- 
gan to itch. I couldn’t help it. I 
asked her to stop it. 

She spilled her drink and looked 
at me almost as though she was 
scared— and I had tried to say it 
quietly, too. 

“Sorry,” she said, a little angry, 
a little scared. *‘Sorry. But you 
don’t have to—” 

“Forget it” 

“Sure. But you asked me to sit 
down here with you, remember? 
If you’re going to—” 

“Forget it!" I nodded at the 
bartender and held up two fingers. 
“You need another drink,” I said. 
“The thing is,” I said, “Gilvey used 
to do that.” 

“What?” 

“That cough.” 

She looked puzzled. “You mean 
like this?” 

“Goddam it, stop it!" Even the 
bartender looked over at me that 
time. Now she was really mad, 
but I didn’t want her to go away. 
I said, “Gilvey was a fellow who 
went to Mars with me. Pat Gil- 
vey.” 

“Oh." She sat down again and 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




leaned across die table, low. 
**Mars.” 

^I^HE bartender brought our 
drinks and looked at me sus- 
piciously. I said, “Say, Mac, would 
you turn down the air-condition- 
ing?” 

“My name isn’t Mac. No.” 

“Have a heart. It’s too cold in 
here.” 

“Sorry.” He didn’t sound sorry. 

I was cold. I mean that kind of 
weather, it’s always cold in those 
places. You know around New 
York in August? It hits eighty, 
eighty-five, ninety. All the places 
have air-conditioning and what 
they really want is for you to wear 
a shirt and tie. 

But I like to walk a lot. You- 
would, too, you know. And you 
can’t walk around much in long 
pants and a suit coat and all that 
stuff. Not arotmd there. Not in 
August. And so then, when I went 
into a bar, it’d have one of those 
built-in freezers for the used-car 
salesmen with their dates, or may- 
be their wives, all dressed up. For 
what? But I froze. 

“Mars,** the girl breathed. 
“Mars.” 

I began to itch again. “Want 
to dance?" 

“They don’t have a license,” 
she said. “Byron, I didn’t know 
you’d been to Mars! Please tell me 
about it” 

“It was all right," I said. 



That was a lie. 

She was interested. She foigot 
to smile. It made her look nicer. 
She said, “I knew a man— my 
brother-in-law— he was my hus- 
band’s brother— I mean my ex-hus- 
band—’’ 

“I get the idea.” 

“He worked for General Atomic. 
In Rockford, Illinois. You know 
where that is?” 

“Sure.” I couldn’t go there, but 
I knew where Illinois was. 

“He worked on the first Mars 
ship. Oh, fifteen years ago, wasn’t 
it? He always wanted to go him- 
self, but he couldn’t pass the tests.” 
She stopped and looked at me. 

I knew what she was thinkii^. 
But I didn’t always look this way, 
you know. Not that there’s any- 
thing wrong with me now, I mean, 
but I couldn’t pass the tests any 
more. Nobody can. That’s why 
we’re all one-trippers. 

I said, “The only reason I’m 
shaking like this is because I’m 
cold.” 

It wasn’t true, of course. It was 
that cough of Gilvey’s. I didn’t 
like to think about Gilvey, or Sam 
or Chowderhead or Wally or the 
captain. I didn’t like to think 
about any of them. It made me 
shake. 

You see, we couldn’t kill each 
other. They wouldn’t let us do 
that Before we took off, they did 
something to our minds to make 
sure. What they did, it doesn’t 



THE HATED

last forever. It lasts for two years 
and then it wears off. That’s long 
enough, you see, because that gets 
you to Mars and back; and it’s 
plenty long enough, in another 
way, because it’s like a strait- 
jacket 

You know how to make a baby 
cry? Hold his hands. It’s the most 
basic thing there is. What they did 
to us so we couldn’t kill each 
other, it was like being tied up, 
like having our hands held so we 
couldn’t get free. Well. But two 
years was long enough. Too long. 

The bartender came over and 
said, “Pal, I’m sorry. See, I turned 
the air-conditioning down. You all 
right? You look so—” 

I said, “Sure, I’m all right.” 

He sounded worried. I hadn’t 
even heard him come back. The 
girl was looking worried, too, I 
guess because I was shaking so 
hard I was spilling my drink. I 
put some money on the table 
without even counting it. 

“It’s all right,” I said. “We were 
just going.” 

“We were?” She looked con- 
fused. But she came along with 
me. They always do, once they 
find out you’ve been to Mars. 

TN the next place, she said, be- 
tween trips to the powder 
room, “It must take a lot of 
courage to sign up for something 
like that. Were you scientifically 
inclined in school? Don’t you have 

50 



to know an awful lot to be a space- 
flyer? Did you ever see any of 
those little monkey characters they 
say live on Mars? I read an article 
about how they lived in little 
cities of pup-tents or something 
like that— only they didn’t make 
them, they grew them. Funny! 
Ever see those? That trip must 
have been a real drag, I bet. What 
is it, nine months? You couldn’t 
have a baby! Excuse me— Say, tell 
me. All that time, bow’d you— well, 
manage things? I mean didn’t you 
ever have to go to the you-know 
or anything?” 

“We managed,” I said. 

She giggled, and that reminded 
her, so she went to the powder 
room again. I thought about get- 
ting up and leaving while she was 
gone, but what was the use of that? 
I’d only pick up somebody else. 

It was nearly midnight. A couple 
of minutes wouldn’t hurt. I reached 
in my pocket for the little box 
of pills they give us— it isn’t re- 
fillable, but we get a new prescrip- 
tion in the mail every month, along 
with the pension check. The label 
on the box said: 

CAUTION 

Use only as directed by phy- 
sician. Not to be taken by 
persons suffering heart con- 
dition, digestive upset or cir- 
culatory disease. Not to be 
used in conjunction with al- 
coholic beverages. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I took three of them. I don’t 
like to start them before mid- 
night, but anyway I stopped shak- 
ing. 

I closed my eyes, and then I 
was on the ship again. The noise 
in the bar became the noise of 
the rockets and the air washers 
and the sludge sluicers. I began 
to sweat, although this place was 
air-conditioned, too. 

I could hear Wally whistling to 
himself the way he did, the sound 
muffled by his oxygen mask and 
drowned in the rocket noise, but 
still perfectly audible. The tune 
was Sophisticahd Lady. Some- 
times it was Easy to Lave and 
sometimes Chasing Shadows, but 
mostly Sophisticated Lady. He 
was from Juilliard. 

Somebody sneezed, and it 
sounded just like Cbowderhead 
sneezing. You know how every- 
body sneezes according to his own 
individual style? Chowderhead 
had a ladylike little sneeze; it 
went hutta, real quick, all through 
the mouth, no nose involved. The 
captain went Hrasssh; Wally was 
Ashoo, ashoo, ashoo. Gilvey was 
Hutch-uh. Sam didn’t sneeze much, 
but he sort of coughed and 
sprayed, and that was worse. 

Sometimes I used to think about 
killing Sam by tying him down 
and having Wally and the cap- 
tain sneeze him to death. But that 
was a kind of a joke, naturally, 
when I was feeling good. Or pretty 



good. Usually I thought about a 
knife for Sam. For Chowderhead 
it was a gun, right in the belly, 
one shot. For Wally it was a tom- 
my gun— just stitching him up and 
down, you know, back and forth. 
The captain I would put in a cage 
with hungry lions, and Gilvey I’d 
strangle with my bare hands. That 
was probably because of the cough, 
I guess. 

S HE was back. “Please tell me 
about it,” she begged. “I’m so 
curious.” 

I opened my eyes. “You want 
me to tell you about it?” 

“Oh, please!” 

“About what it’s like to fly to 
Mars on a rocket?” 

“Yes!” 

“All right,” I said. 

It’s wonderful what three little 
white pills will do. I wasn’t even 
shaking. 

“There’s six men, see? In a 
space the size of a Buick, and 
that’s all the room there is. Two 
of us in the bunks all the time, 
four of us on watch. Maybe you 
want to stay in the sack an extra 
ten minutes— because it’s the only 
place on the ship where you can 
stretch out, you know, the only 
place where you can rest without 
somebody’s elbow in your side. 
But you can’t. Because by then 
it’s the next man’s turn. 

“And maybe you don’t have el- 
bows in your side while it’s your

turn off watch, but in ffie star- 
board bunk there’s the air-re- 
generator master valve— I bet I 
could still show you the bruises 
right around my kidneys— and in 
the port bunk there’s the emergen- 
cy-escape-hatch handle. That gets 
you right in the temple, if you 
turn your head too fast 

“And you can’t really sleep, I 
mean not soundly, because of the 
noise. That is, when the rockets 
are going. When they aren’t go- 
ing, then you’re in free-fall, and 
that’s bad, too, because you dream 
about falling. But when they’re go- 
ing I don’t know, I think it’s worse. 
It’s pretty loud. 

“And even if it weren’t for the 
noise, if you sleep too soundly you 
might roll over on your oxygen 
line. Then you dream about drown- 
ing. Ever do that? You’re stran- 
gling and choking and you can’t 
get any air? It isn’t dangerous, I 
guess. Anyway, it always woke me 
up in time. Though I heard about 
a fellow in a flight six years ago— 
“Well. So you’ve always got 
this oxygen mask on, all the time, 
except if you take it off for a sec- 
ond to talk to somebody. You 
don’t do that very often, because 
what is there to say? Oh, maybe 
the first couple of weeks, sure— 
everybod5^s friends then. You 
don’t even need the mask, for that 
matter. Or not very much. Every- 
body’s still pretty clean. The place 
smells— oh, let’s see— about like the 



locker room in a g}mi. You know? 
You can stand it That’s if no- 
bod3^s got space sickness, of 
course. We were lucky that way. 

“But that’s about how it’s going 
to get anyway, you know. Outside 
the masks, it’s soup. It isn’t that 
you smell it so much. You kind of 
taste it, in the back of your mouth, 
and your eyes sting. That’s after 
the first two or three months. Later 
on, it gets worse. 

“And with the mask on, of 
course, the oxygen mixture is com- 
ing in under pressure. That’s fun- 
ny if you’re not used to it Your 
lungs have to work a little bit 
harder to get rid of it, especially 
when you’re asleep, so after a 
while the muscles get sore. And 
then they get sorer. And then— 

“Well. 

“Before we take off, the psych 
people give us a long doo-da that 
keeps us from killing each other. 
But they can’t stop us from think- 
ing about it. And afterward, after 
we’re back on Earth— this is what 
you won’t read about in the ar- 
ticles— they keep us apart. You 
know how they work it? We get a 
pension, naturally. I mean there’s 
got to be a pension, otherwise there 
isn’t enough money in the world 
to make anybody go. But in the 
contract, it says to get the pension 
we have to stay in our own area. 

“The whole country’s marked 
off. Six sections. Each has at least 
one big city in it. I was lucky, I

got a lot of ^em. They try to 
keep it so every man’s home town 
is in his own section, but— well, 
like with us. Chowderhead and the 
captain both happened to come 
from Santa Monica. I think it 
was Chowderhead that got Cali- 
fornia, Nevada, all that South- 
west area. It was the luck of the 
draw God knows what the captain 
got. 

“Maybe New Jersey,” I said, 
and took another white pill. 

Vj^E went on to another place 
” and she said suddenly, “I 
figured something out. The way 
you keep looking around.” 

“What did you figure out?” 

“Well, part of it was what you 
said about the other fellow get- 
ting New Jersey. This is New Jer- 
sey. You don’t belong in this sec- 
tion, right?” 

“Right,” I said after a minute. 

“So why are you here? I know 
why. You’re here because you’re 
looking for somebody.” 

“That’s right” 

She said triumphantly, “You 
want to find that other fellow from 
your crew! You want to fight 
him!” 

I couldn’t help shaking, white 
pills or no white pills. But I had 
to correct her. 

“No. I want to kill him.” 

“How do you know he’s here? 
He’s got a lot of states to roam 
around in, too, doesn’t he?” 



“Six. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, Maryland — all the way 
down to Washington.” 

“Then how do you know — ” 
“He’ll be here.” I didn’t have to 
tell her how I knew. But I knew. 

I wasn’t the only one who spent 
his time at the border of his as- 
signed area, looking across the 
river or staring across a state line, 
knowing that somebody was on 
the other side. I knew. You fight 
a war and you don’t have to guess 
that the enemy might have his 
troops a thousand miles away from 
the battle line. You know where 
his troops will be. You know he 
wants to fight, too. 

Hutta. Hutta. 

I spilled my drink. 

I looked at her. “You — you 
didn’t — ” 

She looked frightened. “What’s 
the matter?” 

“Did you just sneeze?** 

“Sneeze? Me? Did I — ” 

I said something quick and 
nasty, I don’t know what No! It 
hadn’t been her. I knew it. 

It was Chowderhead’s sneeze. 

C HOWDERHEAD. Marvin T. 

Roebuck, his name was. Five 
feet eight indies tall. Dark-com- 
plected, with a cast in one eye. 
Spoke with a Midwest kind of 
accent, even though he came from 
California — “shriek” for “shriek,” 
“hawror” for “hewTor,” like that It

be that gives you an idea what he 
talked about mostly. A skunk. A 
thoroughgoing, deep-rooted, mother- 
murdering skunk. 

I kicked over my chair and 
roared, “Roebuck! Where are you, 
damn you?” 

The bar was all at once silent. 
Only the jukebox kept going. 

“I know you’re here!” I 
screamed. “Come out and get it! 
You louse, I told you I’d get you 
for calling me a liar the day Wally 
sneaked a smoke!” 

Silence, everybody looking at 
me. 

Then the door of the men’s room 
opened. 

He came out 

He looked lousy. Eyes all red- 
rimmed and his hair falling out — 
the poor crumb couldn’t have been 
over twenty-nine. He shrieked, 
“You!” He called me a million 
names. He said, “You thieving 
rat I’ll teach you to try to cheat 
me out of my candy ration!” 

He had a knife. 

I didn’t care. I didn’t have any- 
thing and that was stupid, but it 
didn’t matter. I got a bottle of 
beer from the next table and 
smashed it against the back of a 
chair. It made a good weapon, you 
know; Fd take that against a knife 
any time. 

I ran toward him, and he came 
all staggering and liuching toward 
me, looking crazy and desperate, 
mumbling and raving — I could 



hardly hear him, because I was 
talking, too. Nobody tried to stop 
us. Somebody went out the door 
and I figured it was to call the 
cops, but that was all right. Once 
I took care of Chowderhead, I 
didn’t care what the cops did. 

I went for the face. 

He cut me first. I felt the knife 
slide up along my left arm but, 
you know, it didn’t even hurt, only 
kind of stimg a little. I didn’t care 
about that. I got him in the face, 
and the bottle came away, and it 
was all like gray and white jelly, 
and then blood began to spring 
out. He screamed. Oh, that scream! 
I never heard an5^ing like that 
scream. It was what I had been 
waiting all my life for. 

I kicked him as he staggered 
back, and he fell. And I was on 
top of him, with the bottle, and 
I was careful to stay away from 
the heart or the throat, because 
that was too quick, but I worked 
over the face, and I felt his knife 
get me a couple times more, and — 

And — 

A ND I woke up, you know. And 
there was Dr. Santly over me 
with a hypodermic needle that he’d 
just taken out of my arm, and four 
male nurses in fatigues holding 
me down. And I was drenched 
with sweat 

For a minute, I didn’t know 
where I was. It was a horrible 
queasy falling sensation, as thoi^

the bar and the fi^t and the 
world were all dissolving into 
smoke around me. 

Then I knew where I was. 

It was almost worse. 

I stopped yelling and just lay 
there, looking up at them. 

Dr. Santly said, trying to keep 
his face friendly and noncommital, 
he said, “You’re doing much better, 
B3n‘on, boy. Much better.” 

I didn’t say anything. 

He said, “You worked through 
the whole thing in two hours and 
eight minutes. Remember the first 
time? You were sixteen hours kill- 
ing him. Captain Van Wyck it was 
that time, remember? Who was it 
this time?” 

“Chowderhead.” I looked at the 
male nurses. Doubtfully, they let 
go of my arms and legs. 

“Chowderhead,” said Dr. Santly. 
“Oh — Roebuck. That boy,” he 
said mournfully, his expression 
saddened, “he’s not coming along 
nearly as well as you. Nearly. He 
can’t run through a cycle in less 
than five hours. And, that’s pe- 
culiar, it’s usually you he — Well, 
I better not say that, shall I? No 
sense setting up a counter-impres- 
sion when your pores are all open, 
so to speak?” He smiled at me, 
but he was a little worried in back 
of the smile. 

I sat up. “Anybody got a cigar- 
ette?” 

“Give him a cigarette, Johnson,” 
the doctor ordered the male nurse 



standing alongside my ri^t foot 
Johnson did. I fired up. 

“You’re coming along splendid- 
ly/' Dr. Santly said. He was one 
of these psych guys that thinks if 
you say it’s so, it makes it so. You 
know that kind? “We’ll have you 
down under an hour before the 
end of the week. That’s marvelous 
progress. Then we can work on the 
conscious level! You’re doing ex- 
tremely well, whether you know it 
or not. Why, in six months — say 
in eight months, because I like 
to be conservative — ” he twinkled 
at me — “we’ll have you out of 
here! You’ll be the first of your 
crew to be discharged, you know 
that?” 

“That’s nice,” I said. “The others 
aren’t doing so well?” 

“No. Not at all well, most of 
them. Particularly Dr. Gilvey. The 
runthroughs leave him in terrible 
shape. I don’t mind admitting I’m 
worried about him.” 

“That’s nice,” I said, and this 
time I meant it. 

TTE looked at me thoughtfully, 
but all he did was say to the 
male nurses, “He’s all right now. 
Help him off the table.” 

It was hard standing up. I had 
to hold onto the rail around the 
table for a minute. I said my set 
little speech: “Dr. Santly, I want 
to tell you again how grateful I 
am for this. I was reconciled to 
living the rest of my life confined 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




to one part of tiie country, tne 
way the other crews always did. 
But this is much better. I appre- 
ciate it. I’m sure the others do, 
too.” 

“Of course, boy. Of course.” He 
took out a foimtain pen and made 
a note on my chart; I couldn’t 
see what it was, but he looked 
gratified. “It’s no more than you 
have coming to you, B3n-on,” he 
said. “I’m grateful that I could 
be the one to make it come to 
pass.” 

He glanced conspiratorially at 
the male nurses. “You know how 
important this is to me. It’s the 
triumph of a whole new approach 
to psychic rehabilitation. I mean 
to say our heroes of space travel 
are entitled to freedom when they 
come back home to Earth, aren’t 
they?” 

“Definitely,” I said, scrubbing 
some of the sweat off my face 
onto my sleeve. 

“So we’ve got to end this sys- 



tem of des^nated areas. We can’t 
avoid the tensions that accompany 
space travel, no. But if we can 
help you eliminate harmful ten- 
sions with a few runthroughs, why, 
it’s not too high a price to pay, 
is it?” 

“Not a bit” 

“I mean to say,” he said, warm- 
ing up, “you can look forward 
to the time when you’ll be able to 
mii^le with your old friends from 
the rocket, free and easy, without 
any need for restraint That’s a lot 
to look forward to, isn’t it?” 

“It is,” I said. “I look forward 
to it very much,” I said. “And I 
know exactly what I’m going to 
do the first time I meet one — I 
mean without any restraints, as 
you say,” I said. And it was true; 
I did. Only it wouldn’t be a broken 
beer bottle that I would do it 
with. 

I had much more elaborate ideas 
than that.

sician), paid any attention to 
medical problems. The attitude 
seems to have been that it was 
the duty of the pilot to survive 
whatever may come. 

I remember attending a lecture 
by the late Max Valier in 1929 
in which he declared that the 
whole problem of space travel was 
merely a matter of having suffi- 
ciently powerful rocket motors. 
Well, yes, if the motors are too 
weak, you obviously won’t get 
an 5 Twhere; but they are only one 
aspect of the whole. After the lec- 
ture, Valier was asked by a mem- 
ber of the audience how the pilot 
would fare. Valier replied that the 
engineers who are capable of build- 
ing such a ship would also be able 
to protect the pilot from all pos- 
sible harm. 

It was a logical answer, all 



right, but first the engineers have 
to know what the possible harm 
could be. 

As I said, the only one who did 
think about medical problems was 
Prof. Oberth who, in the first edi- 
tion of his book (1923), explained 
that the pilot of a rocketship would 
experience two very different sen- 
sations in succession. As long as 
the rocket motors were burning, 
he would be subjected to high ac- 
celerations, making him feel sev- 
eral times as heavy as hd actually 
is. Then, as soon as the motors 
stopped burning, he would feel 
weightless. 

Looking around for examples, 
Oberth realized that airplane pi- 
lots, making sharp turns, are sub- 
jected to higher accelerations, too., 
In a rocketship, Oberth continued, 
the acceleration would be about 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the same, but would last for a 
longer time, even thoi^ it proba- 
bly would never be more than ten 
minutes. He then si^ested build- 
ing a large centrifuge for testing 
and, possibly, training. 

Such large centrifuges have been 
built since and a large number of 
test nms have been made, with re- 
sults which were surprising only 
insofar as they showed that the 
human body is much toiler than 
had been expected. 

The second condition, lasting 
for a much longer time, would be 
weightlessness which Oberth called 
“free fall” but which is now re- 
ferred to as “zero^.” This zero^ 
condition simply means that a 
body is following the pull of 
gravity freely; it does not mat- 



ter whether it is actually falling, 
or moving away from the Earth on 
momentum, or following an orbit 
around the Earth like a satellite. 

All this was theoretically quite 
clear. The problem was how one 
could nm a test. A man who 
jumps from a high diving board 
into water is imder zero-g from 
the moment he leaves the board to 
the moment he hits the water. 
This fact, it turned out, was no 
help at all. 

T HAD a chance— the year was 
^ 1930— to talk to more than a 
dozen high-board diving cham- 
pions, both male and female, and 
each and every one of them was 
greatly surprised to learn that he 
or she was under zero-g during 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



61 





Fig. 4: Water bottle and drops floating under zero-g 



the 33 feet between the board and 
the water. The reason none of 
them had noticed ansdhing pecu- 
liar was easy to ^;ure out; they 
simply were too busy durii^ die 
jump. They had to twist and turn 
and control the actions of their 
own muscles. They probably won- 
dered whether the additional half- 
twist they might put in would look 
better and win them a trophy. 

My next try was ski-jumpers. 
Ihey admitted that a long jump 
felt like soaring, but again they 
were too bu^— their thoughte were 
not on the jump but on the land- 
ing at the end of it 

I decided that it was difficult 
to wring scientific information out 
of muscle men and waited for a 
chance to interview a man who 



had made a long delayed-action 
jump with a parachute. I never did 
interview such a man, however, be- 
cause I realized after a while that 
he does not esqperience zero^ Air 
resistance decelerates him quite 
strongly and, to the body, accelera- 
tion and deceleration feel the 
same. 

Oberth, in die meantime, had 
tried something else. The period 
of time for which one could pro- 
duce zero^ near the ground ob- 
viously was not loi^ enough for 
making any observations and there 
also were too many distracting fac- 
tors. How about foolii^ the body 
into believing it was experiencing 
zero^? 

As researchers will do, when- 
ever possible, he experimented on 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





Fig. 5: Mercury bottle placed in mid*air under zero*g 



himself; even the very best de- 
scription is only a poor substitute 
for having experienced something. 
So he dosed himself carefully with 
a drug— scopolamine, if I remem- 
ber correctly— and then lowered 
himself into a tub filled with water 
of body temperature, closing his 
eyes and turning himself around 
a few times to shake off his sense 
of direction. He told me that the 
sensation was pleasant. But since 
nobody had experienced real 
zero-g at that time, there was no 
way of telling whether Oberth’s 
experiment had imitated the sen- 
sations correctly. 

After the war, in this country, 
scientists built a small sealed “ani- 
mal capsule** which could be car- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ried by an Aerobee rocket and 
take mice and monkeys, two of 
each, up some 60 miles. The ani- 
mals would experience in se- 
quence: 

A. powerful acceleration while the 
solid-fuel booster of the Aero- 
bee was burning; this would be 
followed by 

B. less powerful but increasing ac- 
celeration, while the liquid fuel 
motor of the Aerobee was 
burning, followed by 

C. zero-g while the rocket was 
coasting to its peak. Then there 
would be 

D. short shock while the capsule 
was ejected from the rocket, 
followed by zero-g again while 
the capsule was falling. Then 

63 





Fig. 6: Mercury floats 

there would be 

E. sharp deceleration for a mo- 
ment as the parachute opened 
and then 

D. normal one-g while the para- 
chute drifted downward to the 
ground. 

ELL, the animals survived 
all this nicely and lived hap- 
pily for as long as animals of these 
sizes live. The one thing which 
neither their filmed behavior nor 
their electrocardiograms could tell 
was how it had felt. 

At about that time, the brothers 
Fritz and Heinz Haber, then both 
with the Department of Space 
Medicine, evolved a method of 
producing zero-g safely and for a 

64 



inside floating bottle 

reasonable length of time, namely 
about half a minute, (Fig. 1.) If 
you take a fast airplane and put 
it in a power dive, then pull out 
of it and simultaneously shut the 
engine off, the plane will go 
through a curve, an arc, in which 
zero-g should prevail until power 
is restored. The faster the plane, 
the longer the arc and the longer 
the period of zero-g. For a T-33 
jet, the maximum obtainable 
should be about 32 seconds. 

Since the arc through which the 
plane would coast is very nearly 
a parabola, the whole was called 
“parabolic flight.” 

Naturally, during the pullout 
maneuver, the acceleration would 
be higher than one-g, so that such 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Fig. 7: Test subject practicing hitting target 



a flight would simulate a rocket 
flight rather well: several g fol- 
lowed by zero-g. (The preceding 
acceleration can be varied by the 
pilot by varying the sharpness of 
the pullout.) 

Similar experiments had already 
been performed at Wright-Pater- 
son Air Force Base, but the first 
man, to my knowledge, to make 
such a clear-cut “parabolic flight” 
was the test pilot Capt. Charles £. 
Yeager. Dtiring his first flight, a 
pencil which had been lying 
aroimd in the cockpit rose up and 
hovered in mid-air, proving that 
everything was under zero-g. How- 
ever, Captain Yeager did not like 
the sensation. 

Others did not agree with this 



judgment, so it began to look as 
if zero-g bore some resemblance 
to seasickness. Everybody knows 
someone, or of someone, who be- 
gins to feel unhappy when still 
on the pier, while others, in mid- 
ocean and in the middle of a 
storm, cannot understand why 
lunch isn’t served on time. Of 
course the problem was not mere- 
ly whether a man could stand 
zero-g; it was also whether a man 
could do something while under 
zero-g and how well he could do 
it. 

This was something for the 
School of Aviation Medicine to go 
after. Was the tolerance to zero-g 
an individual problem like sea- 
sickness and airsickness? If so,

what percentage of people tested 
could stand it if necessary, what 
percentage could notstand it even 
when necessary, and what percent- 
age, if any, liked being weightless? 
And after yo uhad found a num- 
ber of individuals who were not 
hopelessly intolerant to zero^ how 
well could they perform a simple 
function, like, for example, push 
a button? 

Q uite a number of zero-g 
flights were made for this 
purpose, some with rather power- 
ful acceleration prior to the zero-g 
period, some with as little extra 
ac^leration as could be manned. 
Hie plane used for all fliese flights 
was a Lockheed T-33 jet, a two- 



seater. (Fig. 2.) The pilot was 
Major H. D. Stallings, who by now 
must have made more parabolic 
flights than anybody else alive 
(unless the Russians drag up some 
pioneer komsomol who started all 
this while still in short pants) and 
Dr. Siegfried J. Gerathewohl 
briefed the test subjects, if he was 
not the test subject himself. 

The test subjects were all Air 
Force personnel from aviation 
cadets to majors, with hundreds of 
hours of flying experience, many 
of fliem also with jet experience. 

First they were handed an in- 
struction sheet reading as follows: 

1. This experiment is made to 
gather information about 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your experience of weightless- 
ness. Read these instructions 
carefully and follow diem 
through your flight 

2. There will be 4 dives from 
an altitude of 20,000 to 
17,500 feet producing weight- 
lessness for about 15 seconds. 
Pull the canvas in front of 
you during* the first three 
dives and direct your atten- 
tion exclusively to the sen- 
sations, feelings and percep- 
tions of we^tlessness. Keep 
your eyes open during the 
first dive, have them closed 
during die second dive; and 
observe a floating object of 
your arms during the third 
one. Find out how it feels to 
be weighdess. This task re- 
quires insight and practice; 
that is the reason why we 
fly this maneuver three times. 

3. Push the canvas back after 
the third dive and look out- 
side during the fourth one. 
Does this make any differ- 
ence to your perceptions and 
sensations in the weightless 
state? 

4. There will be a short period 
of recovery during straig^t- 
and-level flying at 20,000 
feet If you are not sure about 
your experiences or want to 
try ^ain under a certain con- 
dition, let the pilot know. The 
pilot will repeat the maneu- 
ver. 



5. If you get motion sick or feel 
uncomfortable, communicate 
diis to die pilot He will ad- 
just the temperature and re- 
turn home. Switch to 100% 
oxygen. 

6. If you feel comfcntable, the 
pilot will fly a series of three 
parabolas, one after the other. 
This will produce practical 
weighdessness up to about 30 
seconds in each parabola, and 
a radial acceleration of about 
3 g*s during each pull-out 
Compare how this feels now. 
Shake your head slowly in 
the horizontal and vertical 
plane during the third period 
of weighdessness. Do you 
notice any changes in per- 
ception or even visual illu- 
sions during head move- 
ments? 

7. If you should feel imcomfort- 
able, direct your attention to 
explorii^ the cause. Is die 
feeling of unpleasantness en- 
hanced during weighdessness 
or during the pull-out? If 
you get sick, tell the pilot; 
he will fly you home. 

8. If you feel well and want to 
try, the pilot will conclude 
the flight by two slow rolls; 
one to the right and one to 
the left Compare how this 
feels and whether visual il- 
lusions occur during the ma- 
neuver. 

9. Please render a written re-

port about your personal ex- 
periences and your tolerance 
during the weightless condi- 
tion. The more interesting ex- 
periences you can report, the 
better you can help us. If 
nothing seems of interest to 
you, sum your experiences up 
in about 4 or 5 phrases. 

10. Remember: In a few years, 
people will have to live and 
work in sub- and zero-gravity 
for some hours and even da 3 rs. 
Your contribution is essen- 
tial for the exploration of 
space. 

"Y” OU can find Dr. Gerathe- 
•*' wohl's full report about the 
experiences of sixteen people in 
vol. II of Astronautica Acta, 1956, 
beginning on p. 203. The sum- 
mary of that report phrases the 
findings as follows: “The majority 
of our subjects felt very comfort- 
able during weightlessness; several 
subjects reported sensations of mo- 
tion with no emotional involve- 
ment. A small group of subjects 
experienced discomfort, nausea, 
and severe symptoms of motion 
sickness.** 

The conclusion drawn from 
these experiments is the one that 
was suspected after the very first 
reports had been published, name- 
ly that there are pronounced in- 
dividual differences when it comes 
to weightlessness. For the first 
rocketships, one will just have to 



pick those men who like being 
weightless and have no trouble 
adapting to it 

The next question was whether 
a man might be able to perform a 
simple task under zero-g. For 
example: could a man push a 
button? To use a real button of 
some kind for the experiment 
would not do much good; you 
could tell how often the man has 
hit, but you could not tell how 
often he has missed and by how 
much. So Dr. Gerathewohl con- 
structed a “target” (Fig. 3) con- 
sisting only of concentric circles. 

At first, the test subject used a 
green pencil in ordinary level 
flight (little crosses on Fig. 3) 
to practice a little. Then he used 
one of those pencils which are red 
at one end and blue at tbe other. 
The blue end was used under three 
g, the red end tmder zero^. 

The chart shows what happened. 
The red marks (circles on the 
chart) all have a tendency to go 
too high, indicating that the man 
was not yet used to the fact that 
his arm did not weigh an 3 rthing. 
A few marks are near the cen- 
ter and a few a little bit low; pre- 
sumably these were the latest 
marks made when the test subject 
tried to compensate for die weight- 
lessness of his arm. 

The blue marks, made imder 
3 g, usually hit too low and they 
all have a tail, showing that the 
heavy arm slid down. Again there 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




are a few marks at about the 
right hei^t, m^de with an effort at 
compensation. 

I wish to point out that Fig. 3 
is not a reproduction of an actual 
test chart 1 did not have enough 
time to copy one and the originals, 
of course, have to stay in the files. 
But this is the way these charts 
look. 

In between, there were a few 
experiments with floating objects. 
Fig. 4 shows a plastic bottle, con- 
taining water, which has just been 
squeezed. The bottle is floating in 
front of the face of the test sub- 
ject. To the right, there are some 
"lumps” of water floating around. 
At the moment the picture was 
made, they had not yet been free 
long enough to contract to a spheri- 
cal shape. 

Figures 5 and 6 show a bottle 
containing mercury. In Fig. 5, the 
bottle is just being placed in 
mid-air. Fig. 6, taken a few seconds 
later, shows "space normal”— the 
bottle is floating in the air of the 
cabin and the merciuy is floating 
inside the bottle, not touching its 
wall an 3 Twhere. 

CINCE pencil points break oc- 
^ casionally. Dr. Gerathewohl 
later substituted an all-metal 



stylus. The target was the same: 
concentric circles drawn on white 
paper, which was backed by cor- 
rugated cardboard. Fig. 7 shows 
the test subject practicing with it 
prior to takeoff. Otherwise ffie pat- 
tern remained the same; the holes 
punched into the target under 
zerorg; usually fell too high, while 
those punched under 3 g usually 
fell too low. 

If you combine a number of 
such targets into one (Fig. 8), 
you can draw lines showing the 
mean position of the marks made 
under 3 g, in level flight (1 g), 
and under zero^. But these are 
mostly the results obtained from 
test subjects with little zero-g ex- 
perience. As time goes on and the 
same test subject repeats the test 
over and over again, one can ex- 
pect the three "means” to be 
closer and closer to each other. 

There is no "last word” to this 
story. 

The tests go on, and by the 
end of this year— when you read 
this— much more material is like- 
ly to have accumulated. All one 
need say right now in summing 
up is that zero-g is no longer an 
unknown quantity on the road to 
space travel.

Being on alien house guest wished on a family. 



Mr. Rejilla was determined not to meddle . but 




what constituted non-meddflng and what didn't? 



A t that moment, Lucy came 
into the kitchen. Tom 
Reasoner ducked the 
bottle behind him, but it was too 
late. 

“Oh, no, you don’t!” She came 



across the new Luster>Glo floor 
and took it away from him. “You 
heard what the Ambassador said. 
No smoking or drinking while 
Mr. Rejilla’s here. Aprinkians 
don’t like it.”

“Well, for cripe’s sake!” pro- “How do you know?” said 
tested Tom. “He isn’t going to Lucy. She put the rum bottle 
get down on his hands and knees back on the shelf above the 
and smell poor old Rex’s breath. Freezador. “Maybe Mr. Rejilla 
And it’s not going to ruin my has a very acute sense of smelt 
Foreign Office career if he does.” Besides, it won’t hurt that booze- 




hound to lay off for one night 
in over six years.” 

She poured out the rum and 
milk and refilled Rei^s pan with 
plain milk, setting it down on the 
fioCr before him. That booze- 
hound— he was an enormous 
Great Dane— sniffed at it, whined 
and looked up at her mournfully. 

“No!” said Lucy. “No, Rex. Not 
tonight. Drink your nice milk.” 

R ex moaned softly and de- 
spairingly under his breath 
and lay down with his paws cov- 
ering his eyes. 

“There!” said Tom. “See what 
you’ve done? Now he thinks 
we’re mad at him. He’s always 
had his nightcap, Lucy — ever 
since he was a puppy.” 

“Well, he can just do without 
it this once. I’m not going to have 
the representative of the most in- 
telligent alien race we’ve biunped 
into yet going home and telling 
the other Oprinkians how im- 
moral we are. Besides, it’s time 
Rex learned that life isn’t all rum 
and milk. Ordinary dogs don’t get 
grog rations.” 

“But he isn't any ordinary dog, 
honey. Remember who his father 
was. Rex Regis took Hollywood 
by storm. A genius among dogs, 
they called him. He could do 
everything but talk—” 

“What can Rex do?” 

“Well, the point is—” 

“I said,” repeated Lucy, “what 



can Rex do? FU tell you what 
Rex can do— our Rex— this hooch- 
swilling, vase-smashing, over- 
grown lump off the old block. 
Nothing! That’s what our Rex 
can do.” 

“Owooo,” said Rex mournfully 
to the fioor between his paws. 

“No, you don’t!” snapped Lucy 
at the huge canine. “You aren’t 
going to get anywhere trying to 
play on my sympathies this time. 
And you, Tom Reasoner!” she 
continued, rounding on her hus- 
band, who took a step backward 
and almost tripped over the col- 
lapsed Rex. “Here we are chosen 
—chosen over everybody else in 
the Foreign Office— to give the 
Oprinkian Representative a real 
glimpse of human home life, and 
after I’ve spent two days trying 
to get the house just perfect, 
what do you do? You try to 
botch it all up before he even ar- 
rives.” 

«I_« 

“And you’d better get your 
jacket on, because Mr. Re j ilia’s 
coming in on the midnight cop- 
ter and we’re late leaving for 
the commimity port now. This is 
a great start!” 

She went out Tom paused long 
enough to give Rex a consoling 
pat between the dejectedly droop- 
ing ears. 

“Sorry, old son,” he said softly. 
“C’est la guerre.” 

He hurried out

r\AN£RAUX» the Washins^on 
Charge d’affaires to the visit- 
ing Oprinkian Representative, 
and a hard-faced man named 
White, from the Internal Securi- 
ty Branch, were waiting at the 
copter port to give Tom and 
Lucy last-minute instructions. 

“All right now,” said Daneraux. 
He was a small man who had a 
habit of going up on his toes 
when he got excited. He was very 
much up on his toes now. “Now 
listen, both of you. You’ll be com- 
pletely covered at all times—” 
“Right,” said White. 

“Right And what we want is 
that you two just act normal. 
Just normal, you understand?” 
“Sure,” Tom replied. 
“Remember, Rejilla’s the rep- 
resentative of a greater race than 
any we’ve encountered to date. 
They may have all sorts of abili- 
ties. We absolutely can’t afford to 
take a definite line with them 
until we find out just what tlieir 
potentialities are.” 

“Right,” said WJiite. 

“Right. We have a feeling, now 
—in fact, it’s practically a cer- 
tainty—” 

“Check,” said White. 

“—that they’re as much in the 
dark about us as we are about 
them. That’s why Rejilla’s asked 
for this chance to spend twenty- 
four hours with a typical human 
couple in a typical human house- 
hold. Theoretically, it’s just aca- 



demic interest Actually, he 
probably wants as much data as 
he can get. Now you remember 
the taboos?” 

“No smoking while he’s visit- 
ing,” said Tom. “No drinking. No 
fresh plants in the house. He’s 
not to be disturbed once he’s shut 
himself in our spare bedroom, 
imtil he comes out again. Keep 
the dog out of his room—” Tom 
sighed. “We should have sent Rex 
away for the weekend. It’d be 
easier.” 

“No, no!” cried Daneraux. 
“That’s one reason you were 
picked. Because of the dog. The 
Oprinkians don’t have pets. He 
specifically asked for a family 
that had a pet. He wants you to 
act with perfect normalcy.” 

“Perfect,” said White. 

“All we ask is that you spend 
an ordinary twenty-four hours— 
only just remember that the 
Oprinkians outnumber us and 
that— this is restricted informa- 
tion now: they seem to be some- 
what more advanced than we are 
technically— and furthermore—” 

The announcer’s voice broke 
out overhead from the metallic 
throat of the loudspeaker. 

“P/ease clear the sta^e. Please 
clear the stage. Eastbound cop- 
ter landing now. Eastbound cop- 
ter now descending for a land- 
ing.” 

“How come they didn’t send 
him out in a private ship?” Tom

just had time to ask as they all 
moved off to the stage entrance. 

“He didn’t want to,” replied 
Daneraux. 

“He wanted to ride out to your 
commimity here just like any or- 
dinary citizen. Ha! Every seat 
on the copter except his is taken 
by Security agents.” 

T hey brought up short 
against the chest-high wire 
fence that enclosed the stage. A 
gate had swung open and a flood 
of passengers from the copter 
were streaming out Rather 
curiously, in their exact midst, 
emerged the tall, thin, black, fur- 
ry-looking form of the Oprinkian 
alien. 

He was swept forward like a 
chip in the midst of a mass of 
river foam and deposited before 
the four of them. 

“Ah, Daneraux,” he said. “It 
is very good of you to meet me.” 
He had a slight lisping accent 
Aside from this, he spoke English 
very well. 

“Mr. Rejilla!” exclaimed Dan- 
eraux exuberantly. “How nice to 
see you again! This yoimg couple 
are your host and hostess for the 
next twenty-four hours.” He stood 
aside and Tom and Lucy got 
their first good look at the alien. 

He was tall'-in the neighbor- 
hood of six feet five— but very 
thin, almost emaciated. Tom 
guessed him at less than a hun- 



dred and thifty poimds. He wore 
no real clothii^ in the human 
sense, only an odd arrangement 
of leather-looking straps and 
bands that covered him in what 
appeared to be an arbitrary 
rather than a practical fashion. 
Evidently his curly black body 
fur, or hair, gave him some pro- 
tection from changing tempera- 
tures, since the late April night 
was in the low fifties and die 
chilly air seemed to leave him 
unaffected. 

“May I present,” Daneraux 
was saying, “Tom and Lucy 
Reasoner. Tom is an Ambassa- 
dor’s Staff member, here in Wash- 
ington. One of our crew. Lucy 
was on our clerical staff before 
she married Tom.” 

“Hay-lo,” said Rejilla. “To you 
both, haylo. Do we shake right 
hands now?” 

They shook right hands. Rejil- 
la’s furry grip was fragile but 
firm. 

“I am so most indubitably hon- 
ored to be a guest within your 
walls,” commented Rejilla. “The 
weather, it is fine?” 

“Very fine,” Daneraux agreed. 

“Good. Though perhaps it will 
rain. That would be good for the 
crops. Shall we go?” 

“R^t this way,” said White. 

The Securi^ man led them 
out and to the Reasoners’ car. 
White slid behind the wheel in 
the front seat, Daneraux behind

him. Rejilla insisted on sitting 
between Tom and Lucy in the 
back. 

"I understand,** be said to 
Lucy, as the car pulled away 
from the parking area, **diat you 
have two lovely grandparents.** 

*TVell— ** fumbled Lucy. “As a 
matter of fact, I have three still 
living.** 

“Three!** cried Mr. Rejilla joy- 
fully. “How wonderful! I dote 
m 3 rself on grandparents very 
much. I write them poems. Yes.** 
He turned to Tom. “And you, 
sir?*’ 

“Uh— one grandfather,** said 
Tom, “only.** 

’The ways of Providence are 
mysterious,** replied Mr. Rejilla, 
putting a comforting hand on 
Tom’s knee. 

“tJh— thanks.” 

“How black the night,” said 
Mr. Rejilla, gazing out the win- 
dow of the speeding car. 

“We’re almost there,” White 
said. 

A FTER White and Danerauz 
had dropped them off back 
at the house, Mr. Rejilla insisted 
on retiring to his room immedi- 
ately, which gave Tom and Lucy 
a chance to escape to theirs. 

“My!” gasped Lucy, when the 
bedroom door was safely closed 
upon them. “He isn’t an 3 rthing 
like 1 imagined.” She set about 
getting ready for bed. “I expected 



someone who would be more—” 
“More what?” asked Tom, 
hailing up his jacket 

“Oh, I don’t know. More posi- 
tive. More dangerous, sort of.” 
“You can’t tell dangerousness 
from outside appearances.” 
“Well, you know what I mean.” 
“An alien culture must present 
some dangerous points, just as it 
must present some advantageous 
and congenial ones—” He con- 
tinued explaining the subject as 
he undressed. 

“How well you explain it!” said 
Lucy, in admiration, as they 
climbed into bed. 

“Part of the briefing they gave 
us in the Foreign Office training 
school,” said Tom. “Oh!” 

He climbed out of bed again 
and went over to the closet 
“What is it?” asked Lucy, sit- 
ting up in bed. She caught sight 
of her reflection in the mirror 
and adjusted one of the shoulder 
straps of her nightgown. It was 
a new nightgown. 

“Sealed orders, I guess,” said 
Tom, rummaging in an inside 
pocket of his dress jacket “Dan- 
eraux slipped it to me as we were 
getting out of the car.” 

He produced an envelope and 
brought it back into bed with 
him He ripped it open and un- 
folded a single sheet of paper. 

“ ’Information received by spe- 
cial courier on same copter as 
Rejilla*,” he read. “ ‘Advices from

racial diplomatic held. Be on 
lookout for any tmusual activities 
on part of Rejilla and offer no 
information that you believe 
might be harmful in Oprinkian 
hands^” 

Tom sat for a moment, staring 
at the letter. 

“WeH,” he said, “there’s a nice 
general warning.” 

“We’ll just have to do the best 
we can,” said Lucy. “Keep our 
eyes open and our mouths shut” 

“Whaf weak points? That’s the 
problem.” 

“We’ll just have to be careful, 
Tom.” 

“Easier said than done.” 

“Well, anyway,” answered 
Lucy, “there’s nothing you can do 
about it tonight Put that letter 
away in the nightstand drawer. 
Here. Now that’s that for tonight. 
Sufficient unto the day are the 
cares thereof. What do you think 
of my new nightgown?” 

huh?” said Tom, wak- 
” ing up. Sunlight was filter- 
ing through the closed slats of 
the Venetian blinds. “Whazist?” 

. “Tom! Wake up!” whispered 
Lucy urgently, shaking him. 

“Whazamatter?” 

“It’s Rex. Rex!” she cried, 
clutching his arm. 



“It’s what Rex? Rex what?” 
demanded Tom crossly. “Rex?” 

The Great Dane was standing 
by the side of the bed with his 
tongue hanging out in a friend- 
ly manner. The bedroom door 
was ajar. The doors in this new 
house of theirs, unfortunately, 
had a push button type of latch 
and one of the few things Rex 
had learned was to push the but- 
ton on the doorknob with his 
nose until the door opened. Tom 
had cited it to Lucy as an in- 
stance that Rex had, after all, 
inherited his great father’s brain. 
Lucy had remained unconvinced. 

“I love you,” said an unmistak- 
ably masculine voice. 

Tom blinked and struggled up 
into a sitting position. He glanced 
around the room. He peered un- 
der the bed. 

“Huh?” he said. 

“I love you. Get up,” said the 
voice. 

“Lucy!” croaked Tom. “Who is 
it? Where is he?” 

“That’s what I’m trying to tell 
you!” said Lucy frantically. “It’s 
him— Rex. It’s Rex!” 

“I love you. Play ball? Fun? 
Go walk.” 

“Rex!” Tom stared at the dog. 
“Lucy! He’s— I mean he isn’t, is 
he?” With a sudden explosion of 
energy, Tom jumped out of bed, 
lunged across the room, closed 
and locked the door. Turning 
about with his back against its 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




panels, he regarded the canine 
interlocutor before him. 

*‘How can he talk?” he said 
diickly. “With his mouth? Say 
something, Rex.” 

“Play ball? Nice Tom.” 

“See—” yammered Tom. “His 
mouth doesn’t move—” 

“Nice Lucy. I love you, Lucy.” 
“I don’t care what you say!” 
snapped Lucy. “That’s Rex and 
he’s talking.” 

“Nice Lucy and Tom. I’m 
hungry.” 

The two humans stared at each 
other. 

“I’m nice, too,” said Rex. 
“Well, there you are,” Tom 
said insanely. “I always said he 
had his father’s brain— and Rex 
Regis could do ever3rthing but 
talk. Rex just decided to learn 
to talk. That’s all.” 

“Don’t be funny!” said Lucy 
sharply. 

“Who’s being funny? You hear 
him, too, don’t you?” 

“Of course I hear him. But he 
can’t talk. That’s impossible.” 
“How can it be impossible 
when he’s doing it?” 

“I don’t care. How can he talk 
with his mouth? You said that 
yourself.” 

“Well, he is. Rex, say some- 
thing again.” 

EX was nosing after what 
might be a flea or just a 
stray itch. 



“Rex!” Tom ordered in a sharp, 
no-nonsense voice. 

“I’m Rex! I’m Rex! I’m here, 
too!” said Rex, looking up cheer- 
fully. “See me? Play ball? Nice 
Tom. I love Lucy, too.” 

“Wait a minute!” Tom snapped 
his fingers. “I’ve got it!” 

“Got what?” asked Lucy. 
“Ball?” asked Rex. “Ouch! Got 
flea? Flea! There flea. Take that! 
Bite, bite, bite, bite! Crunched 
flea.” 

*^e really ought to get some 
more of that flea powder and 
dust him good,” said Lucy 
thoughtfully. “I could nm down 
to the drugstore after break- 
fast—” 

“Will you listen?” Tom de- 
manded. “Listen, Lucy!” 

“Another flea?” queried Rex, 
checking a hind leg. “Where 
flea?” 

“Lucy, it’s telepathy.” 
“Telepathy?” 

“That’s right. Look, his mouth 
doesn’t move. And he speaks 
English, doesn’t he? All right, he 
couldn’t just do that overnight. 
But if he was just thinking these 
things he says— and our own 
minds were putting them auto- 
matically into words—” 

“Oh, Tom! That’s just down- 
right silly!” 

“Why?” 

“Well, it just is,” said Lucy. 
“How could he go telepathic all 
of a sudden?” 



REX AND MR. REJILLA 



77 




**You think I don’t have the 
answer to that, too?” 

“You do?” 

“I certainly do. Remember 
how smart his father was? Well, 
Rex is even smarter.” 

“But-” 

“Let me finish. The point is we 
never realized how much smarter 
he is because Rex here was drunk 
all the time.” 

“Drunk!” 

“I don’t mean staggering 
drunk,” said Tom excitedly. “I 
just mean he had his rum and 
milk every night and probably 
the alcohol was just enough to 
inhibit his telepathic powers. You 
made him lay off last night— and 
this morning, here he is, beam- 
ing thought waves at us.” 

“Pet me,” said Rex, nuzzling 
up against Tom’s knee. 

“Down, Rex! Not now!” Tom 
said, pushing him away. 

I^ARS drooping, tail sagging, 
^ Rex hung his head and 
burst into heart-breaking sobs. 

“Tom! How could you?’’ cried 
Lucy. “He was just trying to at- 
tract your attention.” She was out 
of bed in a flash and threw her 
arms around the dog’s neck. 
“Poor Rex! There, there, that’s 
all right. Tom didn’t mean it. No, 
he didn’t.” 

“Love Tom. Love Lucy,” 
gulped Rex. “Good Rex?” He 
looked up hopefully and flicked 



out a long wet tongue, which 
Lucy dodged. 

“^y, what a cry-baby!” said 
Tom. “I certainly never sus- 
pected—” 

“Well, he’s just a dog!” said 
Lucy indignantly. “Good Rex. 
Good boy. That’s better now. 
You’re too hard on him, Tom.” 
yelped Tom in outrage. 
“Me? How about you— like last 
night when you wouldn’t give 
him his drink? Just because you 
can hear him now—” 

“Well, I had to.” Lucy straight- 
ened up and sat back on the edge 
of the bed. “Tom, whafre we go- 
ing to do with him?” 

“That's the thing,” said Tom, 
lowering his voice. “Rex here is 
probably the most valuable piece 
of property on Earth at this mo- 
ment, from every standpoint, in- 
cluding the military. And you 
realize who we’ve got under the 
same roof at this same moment?” 
“Who . oh!** gasped Lucy. 
“Mr. Rejilla.” 

“Right!” said Tom grimly. 
“Well, we’ve got to get Rex 
out of here. Right away!” 

“And tip Rejilla off that there’s 
something special about him?” 
“Oh!” said Lucy. There was a 
moment’s taut shuddering si- 
lence. “What’ll we do?” 

“Let me think.” 

Tom walked across the room 
to the dressing table, turned and 
walked back again. 



78

“Look,” he said. “You go out 
and try to keep Rejilla occupied. 
We’ll shut Rex up in here. I’ll 
try to get in touch with Dan- 
eraux.” 

“Are you going to phone him?” 
“No, no,” said Tom. “Too much 
of a chance. Who knows what 
Rejilla might be able to do with 
an ordinary telephone? Maybe 
he carries a little portable wire- 
tap or something. I’ll run out 
and phone from the drugstore.” 
“Go walk?” asked Rex. 
“Sorry,” said Tom, dressing 
hurriedly. “Later— if we’re lucky,” 
he added nervously. 

The drugstore was empty, as 
it should have been at a little 
before nine o’clock in the morn- 
ing. Daneraux’s office informed 
Tom that Daneraux had not yet 
come int^ 

“Hell!” said Tom. 

He went back home. 

T UCY was drinking coffee in 
the living room. Mr. Rejilla 
was seated opposite her in the 
big armchair, playing a flute. 

“Good morning,” said the 
Oprinkian as Tom came in, and 
lowered his instrument “Take a 
condolence, please.” 

“Uh— I beg your pardon?” 
asked Tom, dropping down on 
the living room sofa. 

Lucy hastily handed him a full 
cup of coffee. 

“I was just telling Mr. Rejil- 



la how sick Rex is,” she said, 
with a meaningful glance. “How 
you had to go for the veterin- 
arian. Did you get him?” 

“He wasn’t in his office yet 
Owr said Tom. He breathed 
violently through his open mouth. 

“Well, you might have known 
it was hot,” said Lucy. 

“You find yourself internally 
dismayed by hot liquids?” in- 
quired Mr. Rejilla. He produced 
what looked like a small slate 
and a crayon from under one of 
the straps of his harness. “May 
I make a note?” 

“Oh— sure,” said Tom. 

“I am endeavoring to under- 
stand humanity as a means to es- 
tablishing the bonds between,” 
explained Mr. Rejilla. “That is 
my twenty-four-hour mission 
here. Do you like music?” 

“Well, yes,” Tom said warily. 

“I will play you a small com- 
position,” said Mr. Rejilla. He 
did so. The tune that came out 
sounded like anything but a tune. 
“Does it provoke you?” he in- 
quired politely. 

“It’s very original,” volunteered 
Lucy. 

“Indeed. Eighty per cent origi- 
nal,” said Mr. Rejilla proudly. 
“It is a theme u{>on one of your 
human melodies.” 

“Oh?” questioned Tom, search- 
ing his memory for a single simi- 
larity. 

“A Chinese melody, I am so 



80

told,” said Mr. Rejilla, driving 
his point home. 

“Have some coffee,” offered 
Tom. “What would you like to do 
today, Mr. Rejilla?” 

“I would like to peep,” said 
Rejilla. 

“Peep?” 

“In on your lives. How fasci- 
nating, the living process, don’t 
you agree? You are embound 
with so many things that on 
Oprinkia are unthought of. This 
pet of yours, now in malady. Has 
he existed for a number of 
years?” 

“Five,” said Tom. 

“No, dear— six,” corrected Lucy. 
“Don’t you remember—” 

“Five,” repeated Tom firmly. 

“Has he offspring?” Mr. Rejil- 
la wanted to know. 

npOM sipped cautiously at his 
coffee, which was starting to 
get down to a tolerable tempera- 
ture finally. “Not only that, but 
his offspring has offspring.” 

“A grandfather!” breathed Mr. 
Rejilla. 

“Well, yes.” 

“How noble!” said Mr. Rejil- 
la enthusiastically. “I will make 
a special effort to remember him 
in my thoughts. Now I must not 
detain you both. There will be 
housing affairs to demand your 
attention, no doubt. I would wish 
that you concern yourselves as 
customarily. Pay no attention to 



me. I shall merely peep.” He 
stopped and looked at them ex- 
pectantly. 

“Well—” said Tom. “Uh— may- 
be I better— uh— mow the lawn. 
Don’t you have to bake a cake 
or something, Lucy?” 

“A cake?” asked Lucy, staring. 

“A cake.” 

“Oh, a cake! Why, of course! 
Why don’t you two just putter 
around? I’ll get my cake started 
—and when I get a chance, I’ll 
try and give the veterinarian an- 
other ring.” 

“Superb!” said Mr. Rejilla. “So 
this is how the human day in- 
augurates. I am complete atten- 
tion.” 

The meeting broke up. Tom 
went out and fired up the power 
mower. Mr. Rejilla accompanied 
him. Lucy went off to the kitchen 
and hunted around for a cook- 
book. An hour and a half later, as 
Tom was pruning some rose 
bushes and Mr. Rejilla was 
watching, she appeared, crossing 
the lawn in the direction of the 
next-door neighbor’s and return- 
ing a few minutes later with a 
cup of flour. 

“I’m going to try again!” she 
called gaily, waving to them, and 
disappeared in the direction of 
the kitchen. 

Tom talked Mr. Rejilla into 
trying his hand with the pruning 
shears and hurried off to the 
kitchen himself. Lucy was stand- 



REX AND MR. REJILLA 



81 




ing before a cluttered kitchen 
table with flour up to her elbows 
and even a dab of it on her nose. 

“Tom, this is absolutely fasci- 
nating!” she bubbled as Tom 
came in. “Whoever thought it 
would be so much fun to cook! 
Phooey on that old roboserver. I 
can do better any day.” 

“What are you doing?” asked 
Tom distractedly. 

“Well, the first two went 
wrong, somehow,” said Lucy. “But 
Fll get it this time. Honey, will 
you run down to the market and 
get me some vegetable coloring 
for the icing? Pink.” 

“And how about Mr. Rejilla?” 
“Oh, he can come watch me 
cook. Please, Tom.” 

“I’ll do that,” said Tom be- 
tween his teeth. “I’ll do just that. 
And maybe, while I’m at it, I 
can manage to make another call 
to the veterinarian.” 

“The vet— whatever for— o/i.'” 
said Lucy. “Oh, dear, I forgot. 
But then you can do it, as you 
say. Pink coloring.” 

“Pink coloring!” barked Tom, 
and slammed out of the house. 

t^rjANERAUX!” bleated Tom, 
when he finally got the 
Foreign Office man on a private 
phone down at the supermarket. 
“Listen—” 

He outlined the situation. 

“Now, Tom,” said Daneraux 
soothingly. 



“I tell you, it's the truth! Come 
out here and see for yourself, if 
you don’t believe me.” 

“Security said to keep hands 
off so Rejilla wouldn’t know they 
were keeping the situation cov- 
ered. I can pass the word on to 
them, if it’ll make you feel bet- 
ter.” 

“Pass, nothing! Luc}^s up to 
her ears in baking a cake, which 
nobody in their right mind’s tried 
for fifty years, Rejilla’s taking 
notes, and Rex is locked in the 
bedroom, ready to blab his head 
off. I tell you, we’ve got to get 
that dog away where he’s safe. 
Do you know what it’d mean to 
have even a do^ that could tele- 
path? Rex ought to be covered 
with Security men ten feet deep. 
He shouldn’t be able to breathe 
without a man on each side of 
him. Now you listen to me — ” 

“All right, all right,” said 
Daneraux. “I’ll be right out I 
think you’re suffering from hallu- 
cinations, but just on the wild 
chance there’s some truth to this 
—wait where you are. I’ll be right 
over and pick you up. We’ll go 
back to your house together, and 
if you’re right, we’ll figure some 
way of slipping Rex out so Re- 
jilla won’t suspect.” 

“Well, hurry!” 

“Keep your shirt on,” said 
Daneraux, and hung up. 

Tom paced back and forth 
sweatily for an inconsolably long

fifteen minutes. At the end cd 
that time, Deverauz pulled up 
at the front entrance of the super- 
market in an official nmabout 

“Hop in,” he said. 

White, the Security man, rose 
up in the back seat like a busi- 
ness-suited demon from the 
nether regions. 

“Hop!” he said. 

“You again!” Tom said to 
White. “It’s about time.” He 
walked arotmd and got in the 
front seat. 

“Tell it again,” ordered White. 

Daneraux pulled out into the 
street. 

By the time Tom had run 
through his story for a second 
time, they were back at the 
house. 

“It checks,” said White. 

“Checks with what?” asked 
Daneraux. 

“Our suspicions of Rejilla,” re- 
plied White, with gloomy satis- 
faction. ‘Where is he?” 

“In the kitchen with Lucy— 
I’ll say you just happened to run 
into me at the market— the3r*re 
right in here—” 

T hey went through the door. 

Lucy was still at her kitchen 
table, which was more cluttered 
than ever. Rejilla was conspic- 
uously absent. 

“You got the pink coloring?” 
Lucy asked. “Oh, hello,” she said 
to Daneraux and White. 



“Here,” said Tom, hastily hand- 
ing it over. “Whereas Rejilla?” 

“Oh, thanks!” sang Lucy. “Tom, 
I’ve really got it at last! A cake, 
baked all by myself— just like 
Grandma used to tell me about 
I’ll tell you what I did. I took a 
full cup of butter for shorten- 
ing-” 

“Where’s Rejilla?” 

“I don’t know. Anyway, it’s all 
done—” 

“Where’s Rex?” 

“Why, he’s back in the bed- 
room, isn’t he— oh!” Lucy’s hand 
flew up to cover her mouth. 

“What is it?” snapped White. 

“Mr. Rejilla said he was just 
going to look in on him—” 

The three men made a dash for 
the bedroom in the forepart of 
the house: Tom leading, Daner- 
aux right behind him and White 
bringing up the rear. Lucy fol- 
lowed. 

When they burst open the door 
to the bedroom, they discovered 
Rex lying on the floor and Mr. 
Rejilla tightening a leather strap 
around the dog’s neck. 

“Stop!” yelled Tom, and made 
a dive for the Oprinkian, only 
to be brought up short by some 
complicated sort of wrestling 
hold which White had clamped 
onto him. 

Mr. Rejilla rose with a sur- 
prised expression. Rex got to his 
feet with the strap dangling and 
wagged his tail. 



REX AND MR. REJILLA 



83 





**He’s the accredited Repre> 
sentative of an Alien Power!” 
hissed White in Tom’s ear, and 
let him go. 

“I beg your pardon?” Mr. Re- 
jilla was saying. **Am I in vio- 
lation of some custom? Observ- 
ing that this grandfather ap- 
peared to enjoy the wearing of 
collars, I was impelled to deco- 
rate him with another as a token 
of affection and get-well-quick.” 
“Like furry man!” said Rex, 
happily and audibly, flicking a 
tongue in Mr. Rejilla’s direction. 
“Play wrestle?” 

“All right!” cried Tom, before 
White could stop him. “Go ahead 
— deny it now! You found out 
Rex could project his thoughts— 

84 



telepathy. So you came in here 
to shut him up permanently!” 
“Fight?” queried Rex doubt- 
fully. 

“No, no. Shut up, Rex,” said 
Tom. “Now—” 

1"TE was interrupted by Daner- 
aux tapping him on the arm. 
“Tom,” said Daneraux. “Did I 
understand you to say that this 
dog of yours was telepathixing 
right now?” 

“Of course,” said Tom. “Didn’t 
you hear him? Now, Mr. Rejil- 
la— ” 

“No,” said Daneraux. 

“No?” demanded Tom, wheel- 
ing on the Foreign Office man. 
“No, I did not hear Rex say or 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




broadcast anything,” said Daner> 
aux. 

“Rex? I’m Rex,” announced 
that individual. 

“Well, there you did,” said 
Tom. ‘What’re you talking about, 
Dan? You heard him that time 
all right and— you didn’t?” 

“No,” said Daneraux. 

“No,” said White. 

“But— but— ” sputtered Tom. 
“Pardon me,” interrupted Mr. 
Rejilla, “but do I understand your 
implication, Tom, to the effect 
that this grandfather is broad- 
casting his intentional statements 
by non-auditory way?” 

“Of course he is!” 

“And you, too, are receiving 
the grandfather clear and 

REX AND MR. REJILLA 



strong?” Rejilla asked Lucy. 

“Why, yes—” said Lucy. “Don’t 
you?” 

“Woe,” said Mr. Rejilla. He 
turned about and walked into the 
living room, where he collapsed 
on a couch and fanned himself 
with a magazine from the coffee 
table alongside. 

The humans followed him in 
bewilderedly. 

“I don’t understand,” said 
Daneraux. 

“It is over,” said Mr. Rejilla. “I 
resign myself. I am surrendered. 
I admit all, while requesting an 
asylum from politics to remain 
on this world. How mysterious 
the ways of grandfathers! Ah, 
well. I am not unhappy at this 

85 




termination, being by nature duti- 
fully non-combative.” 

“Sir,” said Daneraux, “could 
you perhaps explain it all a little 
more clearly?” 

“Indubitably,” Rejilla said. “I 
shall confess. What is of all uni- 
versal relationships most impor- 
tant? Responsibility of teacher 
to teach, pupil to learn. Conse- 
quently grandfathers, percolating 
wisdom down to younger genera- 
tions, are venerated. Oprinkian 
nature and sociological develop- 
ment cast us in roles of teacher. 
But what if pupil prove refrac- 
tory? By stern duty, I compelled 
myself to investigative procedure. 
Spy. You understand.” 

“I’m afraid not yet,” said 
Daneraux. 

“During unconsciousing hours 
of nighttime for fine young couple 
here, I investigated exploratora- 
tively. This is result.” 

“Tom!” gasped Lucy. “He 
means he read our minds last 
night while we were asleep!” 
“You Oprinkians have that 
ability?” snapped White. 

I^TR. Rejilla nodded. “Matter 
of training only. Astonish- 
ing as results were, yet I defer 
action until, first, amazing chemi- 
cal investigation of Lucy leading 
to discovery of almost extinct art 
of cake-baking and now this. Now 
this. Overwhelming average citi- 
zens in pupilability.” 



“Well—” began Daneraux. 

Mr. Rejilla held up his hand 
and continued. “Affection basis 
for instruction. Consequently, I 
am informing Oprinkia no need 
to fear humans unteachable and 
set in motion defensive-offensive 
mechanisms of science to deter- 
mine survival of Oprinkia over 
Earth. Myself, I intend to follow 
duty here with continuing in- 
struction chosen pupils Tom and 
Lucy Reasoner.” 

“But what’s all this got to do 
with Rex broadcasting his 
thoughts?” exploded Tom. “He’s 
the important one around here.” 
“No,” said Mr. Rejilla. 

“No?” demanded Tom. 

“No,” stated Mr. Rejilla. “This 
grandfather, though venerable 
and praiseworthy, has discovered 
no unknown talent. His simple 
emanations always in existence. 
Only now, new sensitivity trig- 
gered by my mental investiga- 
tions of your and Lucy’s minds 
last night render you capable of 
reception and interpretation of 
simple animal thoughts.” 

Everybody stared. There was 
a moment of peculiar silence. 

“You mean—” croaked Tom fi- 
nally— “it’s us.^” 

“Yous. You. Yourself and 
Lucy.” 

“But—” 

“With training I shall supply 
you with ability to eventually re- 
ceivi-transalatable more complex

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




intelligent human and Oprinkian 
thoughts.” 

“Wait a minute!” commanded 
White suddenly. “Do I under- 
stand you to say that these two 
people here are now telepathic?” 

“You understand” said Mr. 
Rejilla courteously. 

“Don’t move,” White said. 
“Not any of you. Not even the 
dog.” He went out the front door. 

“What’s got into him?” Tom 
blurted, staring after the Secu- 
rity agent. 

“I think,” said Daneraux nas- 
tily, “he’s gone out to get some 
more people from Security. I 
think we’re going to be covered 
with agents ten feet deep. I don’t 
expect we’ll be able to breathe 
without a man on each side of 
us. Just like you said for Rex- 
only it’ll be you now.” 

“Rex? I’m Rex,” telepathed the 
Great Dane, wandering into the 
living room with tail awag. “Love 
everybody. Pat me.” 

“A most magnificent grand- 
father,” said Mr. Rejilla admir- 
ingly. 

Tom and Lucy stared at each 
other. They looked at Mr. Rejil- 
la, at Rex, at Daneraux. Lucy es- 
sayed a tremulous smile. 

“Would— would anybody care 
for a slice of cake?” she inquired 
with a fine, false brightness.

1 WOKE UP at noon after a 
blurred night before and 
padded around in my bare 
feet. Even the bathroom had inch- 
thick carpet. I showered and 
brushed my teeth, but put off 
shaving. 

Back in bed— it was eight feet 
long, six wide and had a contrap- 
tion that kept the weight of the 
blanket off my toes — I ordered 
breakfast. 

**Eggs McCutchen, cafe au lait, 



pumpernickel bread with Wiscon- 
sin butter and — oh, orange juice,” 
I said. “Fresh orange juice.” 

“Yes, sir,” said a voice. 

Simple fare was what I needed. 
I’d had flaming bananas the pre- 
vious day, but that’s too rich for 
breakfast. And canned orange 
juice is always terrible, even here 
in Paradise. 

I hummed a bit of The Pris- 
oner’s Song, but forgot just how it 
went. “Play Bunny Berigan doing 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




that number, will you?” I asked. 

Dtiring the second chorus, my 
tray came out of the headboard. 
I’d have preferred eating at the 
table, but for a while I was mak- 
ing myself enjoy some of my en- 
forced luxuries. Breakfast in bed 
was one of them. 

“Tray away,” I said when I’d 
finished. The day before, I’d said, 
“Fast broken.” They always un- 
derstood my meaning (I’d been 
experimenting with that) and the 
tray vanished into the headboard. 
Another day was off and running, 
however slowly. 

“Play Nothin' to Do and All 
Day to Do It In/' I said. That 
should have been a stumper. 
Years ago, I’d remembered the 
tune and tried half a dozen record 
specialists, but none had it. It was 
a cut-out, long gone from the cata- 
logs. 

But they had it. Erskine But- 
terfield sang and his piano tinkled 
and it was like old times, only I 
wasn’t as poor. Now I had every- 
thing I wanted, sort of. I roused 
myself and went in to shave. 

“What’ll it be today?” I asked 
the Ear. “Dry, safety, straight or 
depil?” 

“You haven’t tried electrolysis, 
sir,” the pleasant neuter voice 
said. “That would eliminate the 
daily chore.” 

“No, no,” I sang, “you can’t take 
that away from me.” 

“Shall I play that?” 



“No, no,” I said, not singing. 
“Let me try the electric shaver 
with the Rotary Action.” 

It popped out of the chute im- 
der the mirror. I dabbed on green 
pre-shave gunk and went to work. 

“No Razor Pull,” I said. “But 
slow. And it doesn’t get the Hid- 
den Hair.” 

No comment from the Ear. I 
wasn’t always favored with a re- 
ply to my witticisms. 

ROPPING the shaver down 
the chute, I mulled the uni- 
form of the day. Yesterday I’d 
worn a Tarzan-style leopardskin 
with a special pouch for ciga- 
rettes. The day before, it had been 
a midnight-blue dinner jacket 
(shawl lapels) and scarlet cum- 
merbund. What the hell. 

“Attention to costume,” I said. 
“Today the well-dressed guinea 
pig will wear, from the feet up, in 
order: desert boots, soft wool 
knee socks, khaki shorts, short- 
sleeve khaki shirt {two pockets, 
please) and sun helmet.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The clothing came out of a 
wall chute. The sun helmet re- 
minded me of Frederic March in 
Trade Winds (Joan Bennett), 
and that reminded me of March 
and Carole Lombard in Nothing 
Sacred. 

“This morning I will see some 
movie excerpts,” I told the Ear. “I 
will see the scene in Nothing 



KILL ME WITH KINDNESS 



89 




Sacred where Fred clips Carole 
on the jaw. Then I will see the 
bit in City Lights where Chaplin 
swallows the whistle, and the 
business in that Marx Brothers 
picture where a hundred people 
crowd into the stateroom. I forget 
the name of it.” 

“At once, Mr. Bland,” the voice 
said. I went down the hall to the 
projection room. My unseen 
friend could have hoked it up by 
saying “Immediate seating on all 
floors” or “Smoking in the balcony 
only,” but their sense of humor 
isn’t broad. This is probably just 
as well for me, their subject. They 
take pretty good care of me, 
everything considered. 

On my way down the hall, I 
remembered another bit. “I also 
want to see Groucho do Hurray 
for Captain Spaulding”— the sun 
helmet again —“and the one where 
he’s on the couch with Thelma 
Todd and Chico keeps coming 
through the window with the ice.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

It was better than the film li- 
brary at the Museum of Modem 
Art. I kept remembering other 
classic bits and asking for them 
and then it was lunch time. 

But what I really wanted to 
see was a new movie — to go to it 
with my own critical faculties all 
sharpened up after reading Zins- 
ser’s caustic comments in the 
Herald Tribune and Zvmser’s 
kinder ones in Cue. (But nuts to 



those wise guys in Time and The 
New Yorker.") 

I knew, though, that the Ear 
and his buddies would never al- 
low that. They never let me see 
anything current. Maybe it was 
impossible for them to get it, or 
maybe it was part of their ex- 
periment to keep me ignorant of 
ever 5 d:hing that had happened 
since the day of my capture. 

Whatever the reason, the result 
was the same. I’d never see a new 
Hitchcock movie, or read a new 
novel by Marquand, or find out 
if the Democrats got the White 
House back in 1960. 

^ INSSER and Zunser, I 
^ thought, tasting the syllables. 
Many of the things I liked to 
read or, look at, came in pairs. 
Crane and Cain were in my li- 
brary. Hoppers and Groppers 
were on my walls. But nothing 
new. 

I sighed and got up, the pleas- 
ure I’d had from Groucho and 
Chico and Thelma almost forgot- 
ten. 

“I’ll have lunch at the swim- 
ming pool,” I said. (I had nearly 
everything.) 

“Certainly, sir.” 

“Stuffed celery (cottage cheese, 
I think) with a sprinkling of pap- 
rika. Carrot strips, chilled. Half 
an avocado. Ry-krisp; no butter. 
A bottle of Tuborg beer and a 
packet of Senior Service.” I try 



KILL ME WITH KINDNESS 



91 




to keep it l^t at lunch, espe* 
dally after a late breakfast It’s 
my own fault but I don’t get 
much exercise. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Oh— and have Esther Williams 
swim in waltz-time as I lunch.” 

The voice became reproving, 
though polite. “We must reiterate 
with regret sir, that requests con- 
cerning live human beings cannot 
be granted. However, if you de- 
sire it, a film excerpt of an Esther 
Williams water ballet is avail- 
able.” 

‘^ever mind,” I said. “Just 
needling you.” I like to remind 
them every once in a while that 
I know their limitations. The 
trouble, though, was that it also 
reminded me of my isolation. 

After lunch, I wandered into 
the gimroom and whanged away 
at tin cans with a 12-gauge shot- 
gun. The slam against my shoul- 
der was satisfying and the ruina- 
tion of an off-target wall still 
more so. But I knew it would be 
refinished the next time I went 
in — even if it were only five min- 
utes later. They have almost infi- 
nite resources. 

Still feeling combative, I went 
to the billiard room and smacked 
the balls around. This reminded 
me that my next movie session 
would have to include W. C. 
Fields’ business with the bent cue 
and, by association, his segment 
of If I Had a Million with Alison 



Skipworth and their junk-car ven- 
geance on reckless drivers. 

But not today. The trick was 
not to overindulge or I’d aiwa 3 rs 
be in the movies, or drinking be- 
fore lunch, or lying in bed all day. 

“Ha, ha!” I said. 

“Sir?” 

“Nothing. Point for my side, 
that’s all. You wouldn’t under- 
stand.” 

“We endeavor to. Will you ex- 
plain?” 

“No.” 

“As you wish.” The voice 
sotmded disappointed, as if it had 
missed a trick. 

T HAVENT’ a clue to the iden- 
tity of my captors. I use the 
plural because it obviously takes 
more than one to operate this 
elaborate super-cage I’m forced to 
call home. There would have to 
be a whole flock of them to sup- 
ply my peculiar demands, and a 
gaggle of others to study me at 
all hours and keep tabs on my re- 
actions. 

Gaggle and flock weren’t the 
words, I thought. Gaggle is for 
geese and flock is for sheep. I 
amused m 3 rself for a while by 
adapting words to groups of cap- 
tors, species unknown. Were they 
from Saturn? 

“A dour of Satumians,” I said 
aloud to the ever-listening Ear. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I’m classifying yoa If you’re 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




from Saturn, I dub a group of you 
dour. Are you from Saturn?” 

“No comment, Mr. Bland.*^ I 
hadn’t expected any. 

“A dour of Satumians,” I said, 
enjoying the sound of it, “would 
be comparable, philologically 
speaking, to a pride of lions or a 
crash of rhinoceros.” 

“I follow you,” the Ear said. 
“Or a murmuring of starlings. 
There is poetry in your language, 
Mr. Bland.” 

“Thank you,” I said. “Jupiter?” 

“No comment. But Fm listen- 
ing.” 

“Aren’t you always? Jupiter. 
Let’s see. That would make you 
Jovians. How about a jubilation 
of Jovians?” 

“Not bad.” He was beginning 
to unbend. I almost liked him 
for it 

“I didn’t think so, either. Pluto, 
maybe? How about a splash of 
Plutonians? That’s a bit obscure, 
I admit — Pluto water — whiskey 
and splash?” 

“I liked your first better.” 

“So did I, frankly. But you’re 
only as good as your last one, as 
they say in Filmland. Let’s press 
on. Venus? A miasma of Vene- 
rians?” 

“No conunent*’ said the Ear. 

“You’re hard to please.” 

“I’ve got one for you.” 

“For me?” I was surprised. The 
Ear almost never volunteered 
anything. 



“For your people. A tintinnabu- 
lation of Terrans.” 

“Bravo!” I said, really admiring 
it. “We can be a noisy bunch — 
with bells on. I suppose I do give 
you a lot of trouble, Jeeves, old 
man — always ringing for some 
crazy thing.” 

“Not at all, sir. Merely playing 
your game.” 

“You’ve inspired me. Fve got 
one for Mercury. An instability of 
Mercurians. How’s that?” 

“Rather good. How about Mars 
— to complete the inner planets?” 
But nothing occurred to me ex- 
cept a phalanx of Martians, which 
was hardly worth uttering. “I’m 
getting bored with the game.” 

“As you like.” 

A T THE library, I spent an 
hour with Mark Twain and 
E. B. White and Richard Bissell, 
then, my eyes tiring, demanded 
talking books. 

I listened to some Dylan 
Thomas, and Charles Laughton 
reading the Bible, and Laurence 
Olivier and Churchill and FDR, 
and Edith Sitwell and a bit of A1 
Smith, and fell asleep during 
some dedication speech. 

“Cocktail time,” I said, waking 
up thirsty. “Attention to orders.” 
“Yes, sir.” The voice was atten- 
tive, as always. 

“No Martini today. No Gibson. 
Nor Screwdriver nor Bronx. A 
Paratroop Plunge.” 



KILL ME WITH KINDNESS 



93 




“A Paratroop Plunge?” This 
was beyond their ken, as I had 
hoped. They couldn’t know every- 
thing. The fact that they couldn’t 
read my mind heli>ed consider- 
ably in enduring my prisonership. 

“Brandy, Cointreau, champagne 
and club soda are the ingredients,” 
I said. 

“Yes, sir,” the voice acknowl- 
edged, back on familiar ground. 
“Ingredients noted.” 

I gave the proportions and the 
tall, potent drink appeared at my 
elbow. It was really an elongated 
Sidecar, but it was as heady as a 
drop from 5,000 feet. I had an- 
other and thought about dinner. 

I remembered Bemelmans and 
considered an elephant cutlet, but 
I was afraid that, unlike Bemel- 
mans’ chef, they would cut up an 
elephant for only one customer. 
So I ordered a simple steak, a 
baked potato, mixed greens, bread 
sticks and a decent red wine. 

The trick now was to occupy 
myself till bedtime. The nights 
were the worst. Last night I’d 
overdone it, drinking Chivas Re- 
gal straight, out of a brandy snif- 
ter, and had got to bed rather non 
compos. That had been a point 
for their side. 

“This is do-it-yourself night,” I 
decided. “Bring me the makings 
of a crystal set.” 

They had it all set up for me 
when I got to the hobby room — 
and they’d goofed. They didn’t 



often make mistakes, but this one 
was a pip. Instead of the compo- 
nents of a primitive radio receiv- 
er, they’d provided a glass-blow- 
ing outfit, complete with furnace, 
that would have passed muster at 
Steuben. 

I laughed, a little more con- 
temptuously than was warranted, 
and loftily explained their mis- 
take. I could tell they didn’t like 
my rubbing their noses in it (if 
they have noses), but there wasn’t 
much they could do about it. 

The section of the floor where 
they’d set up the miniature glass 
works dropped and I had a 
glimpse of violet mist down below 
before the floor came up again, 
this time with a work bench and 
the makings of a crystal set on it 

It was the first time I’d seen 
how they materialized things, ex- 
cept for my sliding panel meals, 
and I was disappointed in them. 
Trapdoors. It reminded me of the 
time I was one of the kids who 
rushed to the stage when Black- 
stone the Magician asked for vol- 
unteers. Blackstone was getting 
old then and maybe he was care- 
less, but I had a revealing glimpse 
of a piece of his sleight-of-hand 
that took all the magic out of it. 

But there was still a difference. 
I had known Blackstone was hu- 
man and merely a skilled illusion- 
ist. I didn’t know what these peo- 
ple were. I didn’t even know if 
they were people.

I SUDDENLY felt like shouts 
ing at them: “Who are you? 
What are you doing to me?” But 
that would have given them too 
much satisfaction. I knew in es- 
sence who they were and what I 
was to them, and my self-imposed 
duty on behalf of humanity was 
to maintain my composure, refuse 
to be goaded into excesses. It was 
obvious that they were looking 
for my weaknesses and I had to 
display as few as possible, how- 
ever inviting it might seem at the 
moment to indulge myself in their 
virtually unlimited largesse. 

IVe never had a scientific mind. 
Fortunately the crystal set kit 
had detailed instructions and I 
was able to absorb myself in as- 
sembling it without frustration. 

I had some vague hope that 
when I got it working, I’d be able 
to hear a live, uncensored broad- 
cast, but, of course, the 5 r’d fore- 
seen that possibility. All I heard 
were harmless canned broadcasts. 
They’d taped these, eliminating 
newscasts and an 3 rthing else that 
might have given me a clue to 
what was happening in the real 
world. I might as well have saved 
myself the trouble and turned on 
the blond mahogany Magnavox 
in my bedroom or the limed oak 
Capehart in the living room. 

They did leave some timeless 
commercials; for authenticity’s 
sake, I suppose. But I wonder 
whether it was entirely by acci- 

KILL ME WITH KINDNESS 



dent that the one the prisoner in 
their Paradise heard through the 
earphones of the crystal set that 
night was about new, improved 
Joy. 

It was the same with the tele- 
vision set. Everything was kine- 
scope. They allowed me no news- 
papers or magazines and the 
books in the library had all been 
published before my capture. 

I probably should put down a 
few facts for posterity. I don’t 
know who will read them — they 
promise they won’t, as long as I 
live, and I halfway believe them. 

Now that I’ve written it down, 
I wonder how long I’ll live. How 
long do you keep a guinea pig? 
As long as it’s useful to you. If it 
dies, or if you drive it crazy, you 
dispose of it and get yourself an- 
other one. Guinea pigs have to be 
expendable or they aren’t guinea 
pigs. 

But I mustn’t be pessimistic, 
even here in the supposed secrecy 
of my journal. Let’s get on to 
the facts for you people in pos- 
terity. 

Name: Oliver T. Bland — 

known as Ollie to my erstwhile 
friends. (They always call me 
Mr. Bland or Sir.) 

Age: 34. 

Occupation: guinea pig. All 

right, seriously: I used to be a 
copyreader on a big daily news- 
paper here in New York — one of 
those unromantic people who sees

structs the headlines. 

in New York” is, of 
course, a phrase my re- 
spect for fact will not allow. I 
was captured in the city. That 
much I know. IVe since been 
transferred, transported — what - 
ever — to this seeming mansion 
which could be anywhere. On 
Earth, suspended above it, on the 
Moon — on Mars, for all I know. 

What I call my mansion — 
thinking of a big dog I once kept 
in a long enclosure — is Man-run 
2. Nobody starts counting with 2, 
so there’s another one, obviously, 
but they haven’t told me yet 
who’s in it. I’d like to think it’s 
another Earthman — misery lov- 
ing company — but this could be 
a sort of interplanetary zoo. 

But back to the known facts. 

Length of sentence: indefinite. 
I’ve been here months, I imagine. 
There are no calendars and I’ve 
been careless about this journal, 
not writing in it every day, as I 
should. I distrusted them at first 
(I still do, but not as much) and 
shied away from giving them 
anything they seemed to want. 
I’ve become more philosophical 
in recent weeks — you might say 
more self - indulgent — though I 
think I’m honoring my pledge to 
resist them in anything that real- 
ly matters. 



What else? Does it matter that 
I’m divorced? (I wonder if they 
think that’s typical of our spe- 
cies.) She has custody of our son 
(Jason Robinson Bland) and has 
remarried. I thought of remarry- 
ing, too, but with alimony and 
support payments, it was sort of 
impossible — except to a rich girl 
who wouldn’t have to live on the 
remnants of my salary. Of course 
there was always Betty Forsythe 
— an amiable, understanding 
homebody type, still living with 
her mother. Betty would have 
had me. She’d have scrimped 
along with me and loved it, poor 
kid. 

I wonder what my wife — ex- 
wife — thinks has become of me? 
Probably that I’ve chucked it and 
gone off to Tahiti or Alaska as I 
sometimes threatened. And Jace 
(Jason Robinson, aged three)? 
Does he still remember me? Or is 
he calling his stepfather Daddy 
now? 

No more tonight, journal mine. 
I’m depressed and I mustn’t be, 
if I’m to keep up my morale and 
resist them. 

I’ll order a nightcap and go to 
bed. What shall it be? Scotch is 
best, but I’ve drunk the best 
Scotch and I want a change . 

No, you devils, I won’t indulge 
myself too far. I'll have a sensible 
glass of warm milk. Yes, damn 
you, milk. Then I’ll sleep, and to- 
morrow will be another day.

I brush my teeth religiously 
and avoid sweets, to prevent de- 
veloping a cavity. But suppose I 
did get one? A painful one? 
Would they let me suffer and 
study my reactions (God forbid 
they should take a clinical inter- 
est in human pain) or would they 
fill the tooth? And to fill it, would 
someone come? Or could they do 
it all by remote control? 

They could put me to sleep 
and I’d never see the dentist. 

Anyhow, I brush my teeth re- 
ligiously and I use dental floss. 

Jime 25 

^ I ’HATS an arbitrary date. It 
could be right because they 
captured me on February 17 and 
I think it’s about four months. I 
picked it because June 25 is my 
birthday and I felt like a party. 

I ordered cafe au lait for break- 
fast, and a brioche. I don’t have 
breakfast in bed any more. Too 
damn inconvenient. 

I ate on the terrace overlook- 
ing the photomural of the mead- 
ow. As I drank my second cup 
and smoked a Murad (desiring 
nonchalance), I told the Ear it 
was my birthday and I wanted a 
present suitable for a 35-year-old 
boy. 

That give him to pause, as I 
hoped it would. I’m becoming an 
accomplished Ear-baiter. 

“A 35-year-old is not a boy,” he 
said finally. 



"This one is,” I told him. "And 
this one wants a birthday pres- 
ent.” 

“Certainly, sir. What would you 

like?” 

“I want a surprise, so the choice 
is up to you. You should know 
me well enough now to pick 
something appropriate.” 

I guess he went away. At least 
he was silent for an hour while I 
got ready for my day. I soaked 
in the tub, shaved (safety razor, 
close), trimmed my fingernails, 
combed my hair (four months 
long) and dressed in a Scarlet 
Pimpernel outfit. It went with 
the hair. I ordered the costume 
complete with snuff box, whose 
dubious delights I postponed. 

I was in the library having 
elevenses (scones and butter, 
Ceylon tea with milk) when the 
Ear announced his presence. 

“Sir, we have decided on your 
birthday present.” 

I put down my cup and said, 
“Yes?” 

“We have carefully considered 
and have come to the conclusion 
that the present which would give 
you the most pleasure would be 
to acquaint you with — to employ 
your terminology — the inhabitant 
of Man-run 1.” 

“Oh?” I said. I was doing my 
best to suppress my excitement. 
“And what manner of creature 
might that be?” 

“A person of your species,” the

Ear said, "but of tiie opposite 
sex.” 

T DON”T remember what I said 
to that, but I do know I real- 
ized I had to get out of the ruffles 
and velvet. She couldn’t see me 
that way, whoever she was. And 
I ordered my first haircut 
I was directed to the hobby 
room, where I found a barber 
chair set up. I sat down and scis- 
sors and comb came out of the 
back of the chair at the ends of 
metallic tentacles and went to 
work. (The same procedure, 
modified, would have filled a cav- 
ity, I realized.) 

As I was being barbered, I de- 
cided what to wear. White-on- 
white shirt. Solid blue knitted tie. 
Light gray flannel slacks. Dark 
gray Harris Tweed jacket. Black 
Italianate shoes. Blue anklet 
socks. Pack of Tare3rtons in the 
jacket pocket for her. (I always 
considered Tare3rtons a woman’s 
cigarette, no doubt because of 
their ads.) 

As I retied my tie, having got 
it uneven the first time, I asked 
the Ear; “How old is she?” 
“Twenty-three.” 

“Fine! Is she pretty?” 

“By your standards, yes.” 
“Good enough. Does she know 
it’s my birthday?” 

“Yes.” 

“Does she know which birth- 
day?” 



“No.” 

“No? Then do me a favor. 
When you materialize the cake, 
have thirty candles on it instead 
of thirty-five, will you?” 

“Certainly.” There was a defi- 
nite tinge of amusement in the 
voice. 

“No, make it twenty-nine. I 
don’t look thirty-five, do I?” 

“My dear Mr. Bland, a man is 
as old as he feels.’^ 

If that was true, I wasn’t very 
old. I felt like any kid who was 
going to have a birthday party 
given for him. 

She came in through a door in 
the living room which had always 
been locked before. I was stand- 
ing nervously by the sideboard, 
on which cocktail things had been 
set up, fingering my tie and won- 
dering what I was going to say. 
Dance music came softly from 
the Capehart 

She certainly was pretty. 
Blonde, just a bit imder average 
height, wearing a short dinner 
gown that accentuated her slim 
waist and showed her shapely 
legs. 

“Please come in,” I said. “My 
name is Bland, Oliver Bland. Ol- 
lie to my friends.” 

The door remained open be- 
hind her and I saw a section of 
what I supposed was her living 
room. It seemed identical with 
mine. 

“How do you do,” she said.

S HE walked toward me ^wly, 
looking around. “My name is 
Margaret Purvis — Peggy for 
short.” She held out her hand and 
I took it briefly. 

“Very glad to know you,” I 
said, shaking a little, but manag- 
ing to control my voice. Not only 
another human being after all 
those months, but a pretty girl! 
“Can I make you a drink? I have 
just about everything.” 

“I know.” She smiled. “Every- 
thing and nothing. I think I’ll 
have a whiskey sour, if that’s not 
too complicated.” 

“Not at all.” I made two of 
them. 

She raised her glass to me and 
said, “Happy birthday, Ollie. May 
your next one be happier.” 
“Thank you. But this one is ad- 
mirable, thanks to you.” 

We finished our drinks and 
danced to the canned hi-fi and 
talked, trading backgrounds. 

Peggy had been captured one 
morning on her way to work in 
the insurance office where she’d 
been a secretary. She’d got into a 
bus which had drawn up to the 
curb as usual, and not until she’d 
sat down in the rear did she stop 
to think that the bus should have 
been crowded. 

By then, it was too late. The 
bus went into a tunnel (where 
no tunnel should have been) and 
in the darkness she went to sleep, 
or was put to sleep, with no rec- 



ollection of how. She woke up in 
Man-run 1. 

“What part of the city was it?” 
I asked. 

“The Near North Side,” she 
said, and only then did I realize 
she wasn’t from New York. 

“Chicago?” I said. 

“Yes. Isn’t this Chicago?” 

I gathered that Peggy’s impres- 
sion was that our luxurious prison 
was some underground experi- 
mental laboratory in or near her 
former city. 

“Who do you think the Ear is?” 
I asked her. 

“The Ear? Oh, you must mean 
the one I call Uncle. Well, I don’t 
really know. Some rich old kindly 
mad scientist, I guess.” 

I made fresh drinks and told 
her about my capture. I’d been 
coming back from lunch and was 
alone in the elevator except for 
the operator. I’d said “Six” as 
usual, and when the car stopped, 
I automatically stepped out into 
the hall. Only it wasn’t the sixth 
floor. The elevator door slid 
closed behind me and I blanked 
out as I was reaching for the but- 
ton. I woke up in Man-run 2. 

July 4, 9 A.M.

ritating women can sometimes be. 

Whoever said men were the 
practical ones and women the ro- 
mantics didn’t know Peggy and 
me. 1 was the romantic. Here we 
were, my thoughts ran, to all in- 
tents and purposes the last man 
and the last woman. (Or the 
first?) Obviously the thing to do 
then, since escape was impossible, 
was to settle down and perpetu- 
ate the race. 

I didn’t look at it quite so 
coldly, of course, but that’s what 
it amoimted to. 

Peggy wouldn’t admit there 
was no way out. And she made it 
clear that she’d have nothing to 
do with a man who did. All too 
often, when I’d arranged a roman- 
tic atmosphere with soft lights 
and music, she’d sit up straight 
with some practical thought, like 
breaking through the ceiling tp 
see what was up there. I’d explain 
that I’d tried all the possibilities 
long ago. But she had to see for 
herself. 

So I’d break through the ceil- 
ing again and show her the big 
impenetrable metallic dome 
above, which sealed in the man- 
runs and the acre or so of recre- 
ation space beyond them. Then 
I’d break through a wall, exposing 
the wiring and plumbing and air- 
conditioning pipes— and the same 
metal barrier. 

And the Ear patiently cleaned 
up after me. 



Finally I proved to Peggy’s sat- 
isfaction not only that there was 
no way out, but that, by looking 
for one, I’d been willing to lose 
the creature comforts of captiv- 
ity. Now we could be married. 

I pictured a simple little cere- 
mony, Peggy and I reading aloud 
the words of a civil wedding cere- 
mony — or a religious service, if 
she wanted one — and exchanging 
rings and vows. 

“I want a church wedding,” 
Peggy announced. 

“But, Peggy 

‘^ith organ music and a choir. 
And a minister,” she said. “It has 
to be legal.” 

I groaned. “What you’re say- 
ing, then, is that you won’t marry 
me.” 

“Ollie Bland, I said no such 
thing. But a wedding is what a 
girl dreams of and plans for years. 
It’s no good being the best-dressed 
woman if there’s nobody to look 
at me.” 

“I’ll look at yoti.” 

“That’s not enough, Ollie. I 
want to be shown off to others — 
and I want to go places. Havana, 
New Orleans, Paris . .” 

She went on like that for quite 
a while. Then the Ear spoke up. 
It was a relief to hear another 
voice. 

“I can arrange a church wed- 
ding,” he said. 

The E^r had a white satin wed- 
ding gown whisked out and laid

at Pe^Q^s feet Hiat shut her up 
while he turned the hobby room 
into a chapel whose construction 
blended in exactly with a projec- 
tion on the wall of a filmed mar- 
riage service, with organ, choir 
and all. 

The film clip was beautifully 
edited so Peggy and I could make 
the responses to the projected 
minister’s questions. The Ear as- 
sured us it was a film of an actual 
wedding and that the minister 
was genuine, not a Holl 3 rwood 
actor. 

But as we were running throTigh 
the rehearsal, Peggy said: 
‘‘Where’s the marriage license:^ I'd 
like to see you fake that!’* 

I blew up then and Peggy fled 
in tears to Man-run 1. 

Later 

^T^HAT was yesterday. Peggy 
locked her door last night and 
I haven’t seen her all morning. 

I was enjoying my solitary 
lunch — a strictly non-feminine 
hero sandwich and a quart of 
beer — when the Ear announced 
his presence. 

“I have a present for you, Mr. 
Bland.” 

“I haven’t recovered from the 
last one yet,” I said, meaning 
Peggy. 

“The present is your freedom. 
Your term is up.” 

It took a while to sink in. While 
it was sinking, the Ear explained 



tiiat bodi Peggy and I would be 
set down on Earth anywhere we 
chose, with a pleasant amount of 
money (genuine) to reimburse us 
for the loss of our time. 

I knocked on Peggy’s door. 
She’d already heard the news. 

“Will you go to New York with 
me, Peggy?” I asked. 

She laughed. “I will not A girl 
doesn’t want to marry the first 
man who asks her. I want to look 
around. I’m going back to Chi- 
cago.” 

I must admit I wasn’t too ter- 
ribly cnished. 

« « « 

The Ear had me set down in 
my old office building late in the 
day. There were few people 
around, it being the Fourth of 
July— Independence Day. I could 
imagine the Ear enjoying his 
pleasant little joke. 

I went through the file of back 
copies of the newspaper to see 
what had been happening in the 
world in the past several months. 
Same old thing — alarms, excur- 
sions, crises and a few govern- 
ments changing hands. I hadn’t 
really missed anything in that de- 
partment What I had missed was 
human companionship, female 
and of my own choice. This 
world, at least was full of girls. 
And my pockets were full of 
money. I went out on the town. 

Two weeks later, my pockets 
were considerably emptier and

my hunger for female companion- 
ship considerably abated. I’d had 
a wow of a time — one wow after 
another — but now that my fling 
was over, I realized that this 
wasn’t my idea of living. Maybe 
I was getting old, but what I 
really wanted was not women, 
but one woman with whom I 
could enjoy the pleasures of quiet 
domesticity. A complaisant old- 
fashioned girl whose chief inter- 
est was pleasing her husband. I 
thought of Betty Forsythe. I guess 
she’d always been in the back of 
my mind. I looked her up. 

“Betty," I said one evening as 
we sat on the couch at her place 
(a homebody, my Betty was, bless 
her), “would you go to the ends 
of the Earth with me?" 

“Even beyond, Oliver,” said the 
complaisant Betty. This was the 
girl for me. 

“Do you hear that, Ear?” I 
asked. He’d told me he would be 
within earshot, so to speak, for a 
while. 

“I heard, Mr. Bland," his voice 
said. 

“I’ll sign up for that second 
term now,” I told him. 

“Excellent," the Ear said. “But 
I must remind you that the sec- 
ond term will be considerably 
longer. Unfortunately, I can’t give 
you the reasons.” 

“Say no more.” 1 could im- 
agine there might be a long 
spaceship journey, or an upcom- 



ing kink in conununications be- 
tween our worlds. “Who could 
weary of Paradise?" 

Betty had said nothing, wait- 
ing patiently for me to explain 
when I saw fit. I’d never told her 
about the Ear, but she didn’t re- 
quire a long explanation. She had 
supreme faith in me. 

“Whatever you say, Oliver 
dear,” Betty assured me, and the 
next day we went to City Hall 
and got the marriage license.

less outdoors — a stream gurgling 
through a grove of quite realistic 
trees and compliant fish that bite

THE SEEDUNG STARS by 
James BlisK Gnome Press, N. Y., 
$3.00 

G nome has assembled several 
of Blish’s pantropy yams im- 
der one cover and, fortunately, 
without any attempt to imify them 
into novel form except as pro- 
gressive sections of Man’s pro- 
gram for seeding the Universe 
with his own kind. 

That requires clarification. *Tan< 
tropy” means changing every- 
thing, so that instead of under- 
taking the virtually impossible 
task of altering alien environments 



to meet mankind’s rigid require- 
ments, Man has undertaken the 
virtually impossible task of alter- 
ing himself to fit the environments. 
It is a fascinating theme that has 
entranced others with its plot pos- 
sibilities, but Blish’s are easily the 
peers of any rival stories of this 
type. 

The first section concerns the 
efforts of the Port cops to regain 
custody and control of the first 
successful colony of Altered Men 
on Ganymede through the services 
of a manufactured Quisling, grown 
on the Moon for that sole purpose 
and incapable of normal human

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



contact due to his alien metabo- 
lism. 

Blish, incidentally, gives out 
with a frightening and sobering 
side thought. The Port cops are 
an outgrowth of a present-day evil, 
the modem Port Authority, which 
has grown from its limited purpose 
of improving highway commimi- 
cation by bridge and tunnel con- 
struction to its present dominant 
position of airport and terminal 
landlord. In Blish’s story, it has 
taken over government as well. 

Books II and III chronicle the 
fight for survival of two separate 
colonies. Ill was seen in this maga- 
zine as “Surface Tension” and is a 
wonderful yam of microscopic men 
dwelling in a pond. 

Book IV is an object lesson in 
intolerance; the pftint has been 
reached when the basic human 
type is no longer in the majority. 
How does he comport himself as 
a minority? 

A thought-provoking job. 

A KEY TO THE STAHS by R. 
van der R. Woolley. Philosophical 
Library, N. Y., $4.75 

T\R. Woolley is the present As- 
tronomer Royal and his book is 
the third edition of a volume which 
first appeared twenty years ago. 
Very little alteration has been 
needed because the work was 
aimed at the layman and deals 
with elementary astronomy and 



astro-physics whidi have under- 
gone very little change. 

The book is lucid and concise 
and Dr. Woolley has fortunately 
not left his sense of humor in the 
observatory. 

DISCOVERY OF THE UNI- 
VERSE by G. de V aucoulems. 
The Macmillan Co., N. Y., $6.00 

T he purpose of de Vaucou- 
leurs’ latest book is as an out- 
line of the history of astronomy 
from prehistoric times to the pres- 
ent. To a considerable extent, he 
has avoided inevitable overlap of 
previous works by combining a 
comprehensive study of virtually 
all the important milestones in 
theory and observation with an ex- 
haustively compact section on 
p>ost-war discoveries and the star- 
tling new theories that have resulted. 
A new stellar type, as differen- 
tiated from the classic nova, is 
the “flare type” sun, one specimen 
of which increased its brightness 
a hundredfold in twenty seconds! 

The concept that I found most 
intriguing is truly stupendous in 
scope. According to this, our 
galaxy is a small part of a huge, 
cloudlike, lens-shaped super-gal- 
axy, perhaps 50 million light-years 
in diameter!

THE GREEN ODYSSEY by 
Philip Jose Farmer. Ballantine 
Books, N. Y., $2.75 

A T first glance, this would seem 
to be a routine space opera, 
complete with heroic tenor, par- 
ticularly since a symbiote makes 
the hero virtually invulnerable. 
But maybe you have also noticed 
lately the revulsion of many au- 
thors to the John Carter-Kimball 
Kinnison brand of hero. 

The Farmer boy is big, hand- 
some, blond and strong, a castaway 
on a planet of short, dark people. 
He is also lazy, cautious to the 
point of timidity and not very 
bright. A good thing he was sup- 
plied with his GI symbiote that 
increases strength, repairs wounds 
and replaces lost parts and also 
that he managed to pick up an 
Amazon of a native wife, a slave 
like him, who combines beauty and 
intelligence with five kids, one of 
them his. 

He has managed to get himself 
installed as a gigolo to the local 
duke’s voluptuous but bath-need- 
ing wife, and overhearing that two 
strangers have come from the sky 
in a strange ship and are being 
held in a distant city, he arranges 



passage there with a merchant 
ship captain. 

Though a slave, he gives the 
captain a financial plan that offers 
sufficient gain to overcome reluc- 
tance to help a fugitive. He thinks 
he’s lamming on his wife, but 
she’s a heap smarter than he is. 

The story has the flavor of de 
Camp’s famous series, the nau- 
tical atmosphere being supplied by 
an interesting concept in dry-land 
shipping— wind rollers, sailing ves- 
sels of the plains. 

Farmer throws in pirates for 
plot and floating islands for mys- 
tery and almost makes a mish- 
mash of the ending, but doesn’t.

STAR BORN by Andre Norton. 
World Publishing Co., N. Y. Cleve- 
land, $2.95 

M ISS Norton has produced a 
workmanlike sequel to The 
Stars Are Ours!, her superb ju- 
venile of a year ago. It is not fair 
to judge one work in terms of an- 
other, but that doesn’t apply to se- 
quels— they demand comparison. 
In this instance, the standard set 
by the original story was so high as 
to obviate any possibility of parity 
on the part of any subsequent 
yarn. However, Andre Norton |ias 
written a solid, interesting story. 

The descendants of the fugitives 
from Earth’s dictatorship have 
slipped backward in the course of 
time and lost almost all of their 
materialistic knowledge. In com- 
pensation, though, they have ac- 
quired a degree of telepathic abil- 
ity that enables them to survive 
on Astra, where most higher life- 



forms possess the Mind Touch. 

Dalgard Nordis, a youth aspir- 
ing toward maturity, embarks on 
the normal matriculating explora- 
tion with his merman companion, 
Sssuri. They are aware of strange 
activity in a city of Those Others, 
the now vanished, erstwhile mas- 
ters of the planet. Unknown to 
them, an expedition from Earth 
has landed and complications en- 
sue. The vanished race is very 
much alive.

divided his text into six logically 
successive sections: Earth; Moon;

in one of the thom-choked ravines, 
a choir of chatterers was clicking 
through a ghastly morning song. 
It was going to be a scorcher of a 
day. Already the smell of desic- 
cated dust was rising from the 
ground and the glare of the newly 
risen sun was dancing off the bright 
leaves of the hula-trees, making it 
appear as if the bush were filled 
with a million flashing mirrors. 

Gavin Duncan hauled a red 
bandanna from his pocket and 
mopped his face. 

“No, mister,” pleaded Zikkara, 
the native foreman of the farm. 
“You cannot do it, mister. You do 
not hunt a Cytha.” 

“The hell I don’t,” said Dimcan, 
but he spoke in English and not 
the native tongue. 

He stared out across the bush, 
a flat expanse of sun-cured grass 
interspersed with thickets of hula- 
scrub and thorn and occasional 
groves of trees, criss-crossed by 
treacherous ravines and spotted 
with infrequent waterholes. 

It would be murderous out 
there, he told himself, but it 
shouldn’t take too long. The beast 
probably would lay up shortly 
after its pre-dawn feeding and he’d 
overhaul it in an hour or two. But 
if he failed to overhaul it, then he 
must keep on. 

“Dangerous,” Zikkara pointed 
out. “No one hunts the Cytha.” 

“I do,” Duncan said, speaking 
now in the native language. “I 



hunt anything that damages my 
crop. A few nights more of this 
and there would be nothing left” 

J AMMING the bandanna back 
into his pocket, he tilted his 
hat lower across his e}^s against 
the sun. 

“It might be a long chase, mister. 
It is the sktm season now. If you 
were caught out there . .” 

“Now listen,” Duncan told it 
sharply. “Before I came, you’d 
feast one day, then starve for days 
on end; but now you eat each 
day. And you like the doctoring. 
Before, when you got sick, you 
died. Now you get sick, I doctor 
you, and you live. You like stay- 
ing in one place, instead of wan- 
dering all around.” 

“Mister, we like all this,” said 
Zikkara, “but we do not hunt the 
C5dha.” 

“If we do not hunt the C}dha, 
we lose all this,” Duncan pointed 
out. “If I don’t make a crop, I’m 
licked. I’ll have to go away. Then 
what happens to you?” 

“We will grow the com our- 
selves.” 

“That’s a laugh,” said Duncan, 
“and you know it is. If I didn’t 
kick your backsides all day long, 
you wouldn’t do a lick of work. If 
I leave, you go back to the bush. 
Now let’s go and get that C 5 rtha.” 
“But it is such a littl6 one, mis- 
ter! It is such a yoimg one! It is 
scarcely worth the trouble. It 



no

would be a shame to kill it.” 
Probably just slightly smaller 
than a horse, thought Duncan, 
watching the native closely. 

It’s scared, he told himself. It’s 
scared dry and spitless. 

“Besides, it must have been most 
hungry. Surely, mister, even a 
Cytha has the right to eat.” 

“Not from my crop,” said Dun- 
can savagely. “You know why we 
grow the vua, don’t you? You 
know it is great medicine. The ber- 
ries that it grows cures those who 
are sick inside their heads. My 
people need that medicine— need it 
very badly. And what is more, out 
there—” he swept his arm toward 
the sky— “out there they pay very 
much for it.” 

“But, mister . .” 

“I tell you this,” said Duncan 
gently, “you either dig me up a 
bush-runner to do the tracking for 
me or you can all get out, the kit 
and caboodle of you. I can get 
other tribes to work the farm.” 
“No, mister!” Zikkara screamed 
in desperation. 

“You have your choice,” Dun- 
can told it coldly. 

"tTE plodded back across the 
field toward the house. Not 
much of a house as yet. Not a great 
deal better than a native shack. 
But someday it would be, he told 
himself. Let him sell a crop or two 
and he’d build a house that would 
really be a house. It would have a 



bar and swimming pool and a 
garden filled with flowers, and at 
last, after years of wandering, he’d 
have a home and broad acres and 
everyone, not just one lousy tribe, 
would call him mister. 

Gavin Duncan, planter, he said 
to himself, and liked the sound of 
it. Planter on the planet Layard. 
But not if the Cytha came back 
night after night and ate the vua 
plants. 

He glanced over his shoulder 
and saw that Zikkara was racing 
for the native village. 

Called their bluff, Duncan in- 
formed himself with satisfaction. 

He came out of the field and 
walked across the yard, heading 
for the house. One of Shotwell’s 
shirts was hanging on the clothes- 
line, limp in the breathless morning. 

Damn the man, thought Dun- 
can. Out here mucking around 
with those stupid natives, always 
asking questions, always under 
foot. Although, to be fair about it, 
that was Shotwell’s job. That was 
what the Sociology people had 
sent him out to do. 

Duncan came up to the shack, 
pushed the door open and entered. 
Shotwell, stripped to the waist, 
was at the wash bench. 

Breakfast was cooking on the 
stove, with an elderly native act- 
ing as cook. 

Duncan strode across the room 
and took down the heavy rifle 
from its peg. He slapped the ac- 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



111 




tion open, slapped it shut again. 
Shotwell reached for a towel. 
“What’s going on?” he asked. 
“Cytha got into the field.” 
“Cytha?” 

“A kind of animal,” said Dun- 
can. “It ate ten rows of vua” 

“Big? Little? What are its char- 
acteristics?” 

The native began putting break- 
fast on the table. Duncan walked 
to the table, laid the rifle across 
one corner of it and sat down. He 
poured a brackish liquid out of a 
big stew pan into their cups. 

God, he thought, what I would 
give for a cup of coffee. 

CHOTWELL pulled up his chair. 
^ “You didn’t answer me. What 
is a Cytha like?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” said Duncan. 
“Don’t know? But you’re going 
after it, looks like, and how can 
you hunt it if you don’t know—” 
“Track it. The thing tied to the 
other end of the trail is sure to be 
the Cytha. We’ll find out what it’s 
like once we catch up to it.” 
“We?” 

“The natives will send up some- 
one to do the tracking for me. 
Some of them are better than a 
dog.” 

“Look, Gavin. I’ve put you to a 
lot of trouble and you’ve been de- 
cent with me. If I can be any help, 
I would like to go.” 

“Two make better time than 
three. And we have to catch this 



Cytha fast or it might settle down 
to an endurance contest.” 

“All right, then. Tell me about 
the Cytha.” 

Duncan poured porridge gruel 
into his bowl, handed the pan to 
Shotwell. “It’s a sort of special 
thing. The natives are scared to 
death of it. You hear a lot of 
stories about it. Said to be unkill- 
able. It’s always capitalized, always 
a proper noun. It has been re- 
ported at different times from 
widely scattered places.” 

“No one’s ever bagged one?” 

“Not that I ever heard of.” Dun- 
can patted the rifle. “Let me get a 
bead on it.” 

He started eating, spooning the 
porridge into his mouth, munch- 
ing on the stale corn bread left 
from the night before. He drank 
some of the brackish beverage and 
shuddered. 

“Some day,” he said, “I’m going 
to scrape together enough money 
to buy a pound of coffee. You’d 
think—” 

“It’s the freight rates,” Shotwell 
said. “I’ll send you a pound when 
I go back.” 

“Not at the price they’d charge 
to ship it out,” said Duncan. “I 
wouldn’t hear of it.” 

They ate in silence for a time. 
Finally Shotwell said: “I’m get- 
ting nowhere, Gavin. The natives 
are willing to talk, but it all adds 
up to nothing.” 

“I tried to tell you that. You 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




could have saved your time.” 
Shotwell shook his head stub- 
bornly. “There’s an answer, a logi- 
cal explanation. It’s easy enough 
to say you cannot rule out the 
sexual factor, but that’s exactly 
what has happened here on Layard. 
It’s easy to exclaim that a sexless 
animal, a sexless race, a sexless 
planet is impossible, but that is 
what we have. Somewhere there is 
an answer and I have to find it.” 

iilVTOW hold up a minute,” 
Duncan protested. “There’s 
no use blowing a gasket. I haven’t 
got the time this morning to listen 
to your lecture.” 

“But it’s not the lack of sex 
that worries me entirely,” Shotwell 
said, “although it’s the central fac- 
tor. There are subsidiary situations 
deriving from that central fact 
which are most intriguing.” 

“I have no doubt of it,” said 
Duncan, “but if you please—” 
“Without sex, there is no basis 
for the family, and without the 
family there is no basis for a tribe, 
and yet the natives have an elabo- 
rate tribal setup, with taboos by 
way of regulation. Somewhere 
there must exist some underlying, 
basic unifying factor, some com- 
mon loyalty, some strange rela- 
tionship which spells out to brother- 
hood.” 

“Not brotherhood,” said Dun- 
can, chuckling. “Not even sister- 
hood. You must watch your ter- 



minology. The word you want is 
ithood.” 

The door pushed open and a 
native walked in timidly. 

“Zikkara said that mister want 
me,” the native told them. “I am 
Sipar. I can track anything but 
screamers, stilt-birds, longhorns 
and donovans. Those are my ta- 
boos.” 

“I am glad to hear that,” Dun- 
can replied. “You have no Cytha 
taboo, then.” 

“C3^a!” yipped the native. “Zik- 
kara did not tell me Cytha!” 

Duncan paid no attention. He 
got up from the table and went 
to the heavy chest that stood 
against one wall. He rummaged in 
it and came out with a pair of 
binoculars, a hunting knife and an 
extra drum of ammunition. At the 
kitchen cupboard, he rummaged 
once again, filling a small leather 
sack with a gritty powder from 
a can he found. 

“Rockahominy,” he explained to 
Shotwell. “Emergency rations 
thought up by the primitive North 
American Indians. Parched com, 
ground fine. It’s no feast exactly, 
but it keeps a man going.” 

“You figure you’ll be gone that 
long?” 

“Maybe overnight. I don’t 
know. Won’t stop until I get it. 
Can’t afford to. It could wipe me 
out in a few days.” 

“Good hunting,” Shotwell said. 
“I’ll hold the fort.” 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



113 




Duncan said to Sipar: “Quit 
sniveling and come on.” 

He picked up the rifle, settled 
it in the crook of his arm. He 
kicked open the door and strode 
out. 

Sipar followed meekly. 

II 

D uncan got his first shot late 
in the afternoon of that first 

day. 

In the middle of the morning, 
two hours after they had left the 
farm, they had flushed the Cytha 
out of its bed in a thick ravine. 
But there had been no chance for 
a shot. Duncan saw no more than 
a huge black blur fade into the 
bush. 

Through the bake-oven after- 
noon, they had followed its trail, 
Sipar tracking and Duncan bring- 
ing up the rear, scanning every 
piece of cover, with the sun-hot 
rifle always held at ready. 

Once they had been held up for 
fifteen minutes while a massive 
donovan tramped back and forth, 
screaming, trying to work up its 
courage for attack. But after a 
quarter hour of showing off, it 
decided to behave itself and went 
off at a shuffling gallop. 

Duncan watched it go with a 
lot of thankfulness. It could soak 
up a lot of lead, and for all its 
awkwardness, it was handy with 
its feet once it set itself in mo- 



tion. Donovans had killed a lot of 
men in the twenty years since 
Earthmen had come to Layard. 

With the beast gone, Duncan 
looked around for Sipar. He found 
it fast asleep beneath a hula-shrub. 
He kicked the native awake with 
something less than gentleness and 
they went on again. 

The bush swarmed with other 
animals, but they had no trouble 
with them. 

Sipar, despite its initial reluc- 
tance, had worked well at the trail- 
ing. A misplaced bunch of grass, 
a twig bent to one side, a displaced 
stone, the faintest pug mark were 
Sipar’s stock in trade. It worked 
like a lithe, well-trained hound. 
This bush country was its special 
province; here it was at home. 

With the sun dropping toward 
the west, they had climbed a long, 
steep hill and as they neared the 
top of it, Duncan hissed at Sipar. 
The native looked back over its 
shoulder in surprise. Duncan made 
motions for it to stop tracking. 

The native crouched and as 
Duncan went past it, he saw that 
a look of agony was twisting its 
face. And in the look of agony he 
thought he saw as well a touch 
of pleading and a trace of hatred. 
It’s scared, just like the rest of 
them, Duncan told himself. But 
what the native thought or felt had 
no significance; what coimted was 
the beast ahead. 

Duncan went the last few yards 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




on his belly, pushing the gun ahead 
of him, the binoculars bumping on 
his back. Swift, vicious insects ran 
out of the grass and swarmed 
across his hands and arms and one 
got on his face and bit him. 

TTE made it to the hilltop and 
lay there, looking at the 
sweep of land beyond. It was more 
of the same, more of the blister- 
ing, dusty slogging, more of thorn 
and tangled ravine and awful 
emptiness. 

He lay motionless, watching for 
a hint of motion, for the fitful 
shadow, for any wrongness in the 
terrain that might be the Cytha. 

But there was nothing. The land 
lay quiet under the declining sun. 
Far on the horizon, a herd of some 
sort of animals was grazing, but 
there was nothing else. 

Then he saw the motion, just 
a flicker, on the knoll ahead— about 
halfway up. 

He laid the rifle carefully on the 
ground and hitched the binoculars 
around. He raised them to his eyes 
and moved them slowly back and 
forth. The animal was there where 
he had seen the motion. 

It was resting, looking back along 
the way that it had come, watch- 
ing for the first sign of its trailers. 
Duncan tried to make out the size 
and shape, but it blended with the 
grass and the dun soil and he could 
not be sure exactly what it looked 
like. 



He let the glasses down and now 
that he had located it, he o>uld 
distinguish its outline with the 
naked eye. 

His hand reached out and slid 
the rifle to him. He fitted it to his 
shoulder and wriggled his body 
for closer contact with the ground. 
The cross-hairs centered on the 
faint outline on the knoll and then 
the beast stood up. 

It was not as large as he had 
thought it might be — perhaps a 
little larger than Earth lion-size, 
but it certainly was no lion. It was 
a square-set thing and black and 
inclined to lumpiness and it had 
an awkward look about it, but 
there were strength and ferocious- 
ness as well. 

Duncan tilted the muzzle of the 
rifle so that the cross-hairs cen- 
tered on the massive neck. He 
drew in a breath and held it and 
began the trigger squeeze. 

The rifle bucked hard against 
his shoulder and the report ham- 
mered in his head and the beast 
went down. It did not lurch or fall; 
it simply melted down and dis- 
appeared, hidden in the grass. 

‘‘Dead center,” Duncan assured 
himself. 

He worked the mechanism and 
the spent cartridge case flew out 
The feeding mechanism snicked 
and the fresh shell clicked as it 
slid into the breech. 

He lay for a moment, watching. 
And on the knoll where the thing 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



115 




had fallen, the grass was twitching 
as if the wind were blowing, only 
there was no wind. But despite 
the twitching of the grass, there 
was no sign of the Cytha. It did 
not struggle up again. It stayed 
where it had fallen. 

Duncan got to his feet, di^ out 
the bandanna and mopped at his 
face. He heard the soft thud of 
the step behind him and turned 
his head. It was the tracker. 

“It’s all right, Sipar,” he said. 
“You can quit worrying. I got it. 
We can go home now.” 

I T had been a long, hard chase, 
longer than he had thought it 
might be. But it had been success- 
ful and that was the thing that 
counted. For the moment, the vua 
crop was safe. 

He tucked the bandanna back 
into his pocket, went down the 
slope and started up the knoll. He 
reached the place where the Cytha 
had fallen. There were three small 
gouts of tom, mangled fur and 
flesh lying on the ground and diere 
was nothing else. 

He spun around and jerked his 
rifle up. Every nerve was scream- 
ingly alert. He swung his head, 
searching for the slightest move- 
ment, for some shape or color that 
was not the shape or color of the 
bush or grass or ground. But there 
was nothing. The heat droned in 
the hush of afternoon. There was 
not a breath of moving air. But 



there was danger— a saw-tooflied 
sense of danger close behind his 
neck. 

“Sipar!” he called in a tense 
whisper, “Watch out!” 

The native stood motionless, un- 
heeding, its eyeballs rolling up 
until there was only white, while 
the muscles stood out along its 
throat like straining ropes of steeL 

Duncan slowly swiveled, rifle 
held almost at arm’s length, el- 
bows crooked a little, ready to 
bring the weapon into play in a 
fraction of a second. 

Nothing stirred. There was no 
more than emiJtiness— the empti- 
ness of sun and molten sky, of 
grass and scraggy bush, of a 
brown-and-yellow land stretching 
into forevemess. 

Step by step, Duncan covered 
the hillside and finally came back 
to the place where the native 
squatted on its heels and moaned, 
rocking back and forth, arms 
locked tightly across its chest, as 
if it tried to cradle itself in a 
sort of illusory comfort. 

The Earthman walked to the 
place where the C3rtha had fallen 
and picked ur one by one, the 
bits of bleeding flesh. They had 
been mangled by his bullet. They 
were limp and had no shape. And 
it was queer, he thought. In all his 
years of hunting, over many 
planets, he had never known a bul- 
let to rip out hunks of flesh. 

He dropped the bloody pieces 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




back into the grass and wiped 
his hand upon his thighs. He got 
up a little stiffly. 

He’d found no trail of blood 
leading through the grass, and sure- 
ly an animal with a hole of that 
size would leave a trail. 

And as he stood there upon the 
hillside, with the bloody finger- 
prints still wet and glistening upon 
the fabric of his trousers, he felt 
the first cold touch of fear, as if 
the fingertips of fear might mo- 
mentarily, almost casually, have 
trailed across his heart. 

¥¥£ turned around and walked 
back to the native, reached 
down and shook it. 

“Snap out of it,” he ordered. 

He expected pleading, cowering, 
terror, but there was none. 

Sipar got swiftly to its feet and 
stood looking at him and there 
was, he thought, an odd glitter in 
its eyes. 

“Get going,” Duncan said. “We 
still have a little time. Start 
circlii^ and pick up the trail. 1 
will cover you.” 

He glanced at the sun. An hour 
and a half still left— maybe as 
much as two. There m^t still be 
time to get this buttoned up before 
the fall of n^t 

A half mile beyond the knoll, 
Sipar picked up the trail again and 
they went ahead, but now they 
traveled more cautiously, for any 
bush, any rock, any clump of grass 



might conceal die wounded beast 

Duncan found himself on edge 
and cursed himself savagely for 
it. He’d been in tight spots before. 
This was nothing new to him. 
There was no reason to get him- 
self tensed up. It was a deadly 
business, sure, but he had faced 
others calmly and walked away 
from them. It was those frontier 
tales he’d heard about the C 5 ^a— 
the kind of superstitious chatter 
that one always heard on the edge 
of unknown land. 

He gripped the rifle tighter and 
went on. 

No animal, he told himself, was 
unkillable. 

Half an hour before sunset, he 
called a halt when they reached a 
brackish waterhole. The light soon 
would be getting bad for shoot- 
ing. In the morning, the}^d take 
up the trail again, and by that 
time the Cytha would be at an 
even greater disadvantage. It 
would be stiff and slow and weak. 
It might be even dead. 

Duncan gathered wood and 
built a fire in the lee of a thorn- 
bush thicket. Sipar waded out with 
the canteens and thrust them at 
arm’s length beneath the surface 
to fill them. The water still was 
warm and evil-tasting, but it was 
fairly free of scum and a thirsty 
man could drink it. 

The sun went down and dark- 
ness fell quickly. They dragged 
more wood out of the thicket and 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE

piled it carefully close at hand. 

Duncan reached into his pocket 
and brought out the little bag of 
rockahominy. 

“Here,” he said to Sipar. “Sup- 
per.” 

The native held one hand 
cupped and Duncan poured a 
little mound into its palm. 

“Thank you, mister,” Sipar said. 
“Food-giver.” 

“Huh?” asked Duncan, then 
caught what the native meant. 
“Dive into it,” he said, almost kind- 
ly. “It isn’t much, but it gives you 
strength. We'll need strength to- 
morrow.” 

t'OOD-giver, eh? Trying to but- 
* ter him up, perhaps. In a little 
while, Sipar would start whining 
for him to knock off the hunt and 
head back for the farm. 

Although, come to think of it, 
he really was the food-giver to this 
bunch of sexless wonders. Com, 
thank God, grew well on the red 
and stubborn soil of Layard— good 
old com from North America. Fed 
to hogs, made into corn-pone for 
breakfast back on Earth, and here, 
on Layard, the staple food crop 
for a gang of shiftless varmints 
who still regarded, with some good 
solid skepticism and round-eyed 
wonder, this imorthodox idea that 
one should take the trouble to 
grow plants to eat rather than go 
out and scrounge for them. 

Com from North America, he 



thought, growing side by side with 
the vua of Layard. And that was 
the way it went. Something from 
one planet and something from an- 
other and still something further 
from a third and so was built up 
through the wide social confed- 
eracy of space a truly cosmic cul- 
ture which in the end, in another 
ten thousand years or so, might 
spell out some way of life with 
more sanity and understanding 
than was evident today. 

He poured a moimd of rocka- 
hominy into his own hand and 
put the bag back into his pocket. 

“Sipar.” 

“Yes, mister?” 

“You were not scared today 
when the donovan threatened to 
attack us.” 

“No, mister. The donovan would 
not hurt me.” 

“I see. You said the donovan 
was taboo to you. Could it be that 
you, likewise, are taboo to the 
donovan?” 

“Yes, mister. The donovan and 
I grew up together.” 

“Oh, so that's it,” said Duncan. 

He put a pinch of the parched 
and powdered com into his mouth 
and took a sip of brackish water. 
He chewed reflectively on the re- 
sultant mash. 

He might go ahead, he knew, 
and ask why and how and where 
Sipar and the donovan had grown 
up together, but there was no point 
to it. This was exactly the kind 



118

of tangle tiiat Shotwell was for- 
ever getting into. 

Half the time^ he told himself, 
Fm convinced the little stinkers 
arc doing no more than pulling our 
legs. 

What a fantastic bunch of 
jerks! Not men, not women, just 
things. And while there were never 
babies, there were children, al- 
though never less than eight or 
nine years old. And if there were 
no babies, where did the eight- 
and nine-year-olds come from? 

SUPPOSE,” he said, “that 
^ these other things that are 
your taboos, the stiltbirds and the 
screamers and the like, also grew 
up with you.” 

“That is right, mister.” 

“Some playground that must 
have been,” said Duncan. 

He went on chewing, staring out 
into the darkness beyond the ring 
of firelight. 

“There’s something in the thorn 
bush, mister.” 

“I didn’t hear a thing.” 

“Little pattern^. Something is 
running there.” 

Duncan listened closely. What 
Sipar said was true. A lot of little 
things were running in the thicket. 

“More than likely mice,” he 
said. 

He finished his rockahominy 
and took an extra swig of water, 
gagging on it slightly. 

“Get your rest,” he told Sipar. 



“I’ll wake you later so I can 
catch a wink or two.” 

“Mister,” Sipar said, “I will 
stay with you to the end.” 

“Well,” said Duncan, somewhat 
startled, “that is decent of you.” 

“I will stay to the death,” Sipar 
promised earnestly. 

“Don’t strain yourself,” said 
Duncan. 

He picked up the rifle and 
walked down to the waterhole. 

The night was quiet and the 
land continued to have that empty 
feeling. Empty except for the fire 
and the waterhole and the little 
micelike animals running in the 
thicket 

And Sipar— Sipar lying by the 
fire, curled up and sound asleep al- 
ready. Naked, with not a weapon 
to its hand— just the naked animal, 
the basic humanoid, and yet with 
underlying purpose that at times 
was baffling. Scared and shiver- 
ing this morning at mere mention 
of the Cytha, yet never faltering 
on the trail; in pure funk back 
there on the knoll where they had 
lost the C3^a, but now ready to 
go on to the death. 

Duncan went back to the fire 
and prodded Sipar with his toe. 
The native came straight up out 
of sleep. 

“Whose death?” asked Dimcan. 
“Whose death were you talking 

of?” 

‘Why, ours, of course,” said 
Sipar, and went back to sleep. 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



119 




Ill 

T^UNCAN did not see the arrow 
coming. He heard the swish- 
ing whistle and felt the wind of it 
on the right side of his throat and 
then it thunked into a tree behind 
him. 

He leaped aside and dived for 
the cover of a tumbled mound of 
boulders and almost instinctively 
his thumb pushed the fire control 
of the rifle up to automatic. 

He crouched behind the jumbled 
rocks and peered ahead. There 
was not a thing to see. The hula- 
trees shimmered in the blaze of 
sun and the thorn-bush was gray 
and lifeless and the only things 
astir were three stilt-birds walking 
gravely a quarter of a mile away. 

“Sipar!” he whispered. 

“Here, mister.” 

“Keep low. It’s still out there.” 

Whatever it might be. Still out 
there and waiting for another shot. 
Duncan shivered, remembering the 
feel of the arrow flying past his 
throat. A hell of a way for a man 
to die — out at the tail-end of 
nowhere with an arrow in his 
throat and a scared-stiff native 
heading back for home as fast as 
it could go. 

He flicked the control on the 
rifle back to single fire, crawled 
around the rock pile and sprinted 
for a grove of trees that stood on 
higher ground. He reached them 
and there he flanked the spot from 



which the arrow must have come. 

He unlimbered the binoculars 
and glassed the area. He still saw 
no sign. Whatever had taken the 
pot shot at them had made its 
getaway. 

He walked back to the tree 
where the arrow still stood out, 
its point driven deep into the bark. 
He grasped the shaft and wrenched 
the arrow free. 

“You can come out now,” he 
called to Sipar. “There’s no one 
around.” 

The arrow was unbelievably 
crude. The unfeathered shaft 
looked as if it had been battered 
off to the proper length with a 
jagged stone. Tire arrowhead was 
unflaked flint picked up from some 
outcropping or dry creek bed, and 
it was awkwardly bound to the 
shaft with the tough but pliant in- 
ner bark of the hula-tree. 

“You recognize this?” he asked 
Sipar. 

The native took the arrow and 
examined it. “Not my tribe.” 

“Of course not your tribe. Yours 
wouldn’t take a shot at us. Some 
other tribe, perhaps?” 

“Very poor arrow.” 

“I know that. But it could kill 
you just as dead as if it were a 
good one. Do you recognize it?” 
“No tribe made this arrow,” Si- 
par declared. 

“Child, maybe?” 

“What would child do way out 
here?” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“That^s what I thought, too,” 
said Duncan. 

TTE took the arrow back, held it 
between his thumbs and fore- 
fingers and twirled it slowly, with 
a terrifying thought nibbling at his 
brain. It couldn’t be. It was too 
fantastic. He wondered if the sxm 
was finally getting him that he had 
thought of it at all. 

He squatted down and dug at 
the ground with the makeshift ar- 
row point. “Sipar, what do you ac- 
tually know about the Cytha?” 

“Nothing, mister. Scared of it 
is all.” 

“We aren’t turning back. If 
there’s something that you know 
— something that would help 
us ... ” 

It was as close as he could come 
to begging aid. It was further than 
he had meant to go. He should not 
have asked at all, he thought 
angrily. 

“I do not know,” the native said. 

Duncan cast the arrow to one 
side and rose to his feet. He 
cradled the rifle in his arm. ‘Xe^s 
go.” 

He watched Sipar trot ahead. 
Crafty little stinker, he told him- 
self. It knows more than it’s tell- 
ing. 

They toiled into the afternoon. 
It was, if possible, hotter and drier 
than the day before. There was a 
sense of tension in the air— no, that 
was rot And even if there were, a 



man must act as if it were not 
there. If he let himself fall prey to 
every mood out in this empty land, 
he only had himself to blame for 
whatever happened to him. 

The tracking was harder now. 
The day before, the Cytha had 
only run away, strait-line flee- 
ing to keep ahead of them, to stay 
out of their reach. Now it was be- 
coming tricky. It backtracked 
often in an attempt to throw them 
off. Twice in the afternoon, the 
trail blanked out entirely and it 
was only after long searching that 
Sipar picked it up again— in one 
instance, a mile away from where 
it had vanished in thin air. 

That vanishing bothered Dun- 
can more than he would admit 
Trails do not disappear entirely, 
not when the terrain remains the 
same, not when the weather is un- 
changed. Something was going on, 
something, perhaps, that Sipar 
knew far more about than it was 
willing to divulge. 

He watched the native closely 
and there kerned nothing suspi- 
cious. It continued at its work. It 
was, for all to see, the good and 
faithful hound. 

T ATE in the afternoon, the plain 
on which they had been trav- 
eling suddenly dropped away. 
They stood poised on the brink of 
a great escarpment and looked far 
out to great tangled forests and a 
flowing river. 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




It was like suddenly comii^ 
into another and beautiful room 
that one had not expected. 

This was new land, never seen 
before by any Earthman. For no 
one had ever mentioned that some- 
where to the west a forest lay be- 
yond the bush. Men coming in 
from space had seen it, probably, 
but only as a different color-mark- 
ing on the planet. To them, it 
made no difference. 

But to the men who lived on 
Layard, to the planter and the 
trader, the prospector and the hun- 
ter, it was important And I, 
thought Duncan with a sense of 
triumph, am the man who found 
it. 

“Mister!” 

“Now what?” 

“Out there. Skun^’ 

“I don’t—” 

“Out there, mister. Across ffie 
river.” 

Duncan saw it then— a haze in 
the blueness of the rift— a puff of 
copper moving very fast, and as 
he watched, he heard the far-off 
keening of the storm, a shiver in 
the air rather than a sound. 

He watched in fascination as it 
moved along the river and saw 
the boiling fury it made out of the 
forest. It struck and crossed the 
river, and the river for a moment 
seemed to stand on end, with a 
sheet of silvery water splashed 
toward the sky. 

Then it was gone as quickly as 



it had happened, but there was a 
tumbled slash across the forest 
where the churning winds had 
traveled. 

Back at the farm, Zikkara had 
warned him of the skun. This was 
the season for them, it had said, 
and a man caught in one wouldn’t 
have a chance. 

Duncan let his breath out slowly. 

“Bad,” said Sipar. 

“Yes, very bad.” 

“Hit fast. No warning.” 

“What about the trail?” asked 
Duncan. “Did the Cytha— ” 

Sipar nodded downward. 

“Can we make it before night- 
fall?” 

“I think so,” Sipar answered. 

It was rougher than they had 
thought. Twice they went down 
blind trails that pinched off, with 
sheer rock faces opening out into 
drops of hundreds of feet, and 
were forced to climb again and 
find another way. 

They reached the bottom of the 
escarpment as the brief twilight 
closed in and they hurried to 
gather firewood. There was no 
water, but a little was still left 
in their canteens and they made 
do with that. 

A FTER their scant meal of 
rockahominy, Sipar rolled 
himself into a ball and went to 
sleep immediately. 

Duncan sat with his back against 
a boulder which one day, long ago, 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



123 




had fallen from the slope above 
them, but was now half buried in 
the soil that through the ages had 
kept sifting down. 

Two days gone, he told him- 
self. 

Was there, after all, some truth 
in the whispered tales that made 
the rounds back at the settlements 
—that no one should waste his time 
in tracking down a Cytha, since a 
Cytha was unkillable? 

Nonsense, he told himself. And 
yet the hunt had toughened, the 
trail become more difficult, the 
Cytha a much more cunning and 
elusive quarry. Where it had run 
from them the day before, now 
it fought to shake them off. And if 
it did that the second day, why 
had it not tried to throw them 
off the first? And what about the 
third day— tomorrow? 

He shook his head. It seemed 
incredible that an animal would 
become more formidable as the 
hunt progressed. But that seemed 
to be exactly what had happened. 
More spooked, perhaps, more 
frightened— only the C5rtha did not 
act like a frightened beast. It was 
acting like an animal that was 
gaining savvy and determination, 
and that was somehow frightening. 

From far off to the west, toward 
the forest and the river, came the 
laughter and the howling of a pack 
of screamers. Duncan leaned his 
rifle against the boulder and got 
up to pile more wood on the fire. 



He stared out into the western 
darkness, listening to the racket 
He made a wry face and pushed a 
hand absent-mindedly through his 
hair. He put out a silent hope that 
the screamers would decide to 
keep their distance. They were 
something a man could do with- 
out. 

Behind him, a pebble came 
bumping down the slope. It 
thudded to a rest just short of 
the fire. 

Duncan spim around. Foolish 
thing to do, he thought, to camp 
so near the slope. If something 
big should start to move, they’d 
be out of luck. 

He stood and listened. The night 
was quiet. Even the screamers had 
shut up for the moment. Just one 
rolling rock and he had his hackles 
up. He’d have to get himself in 
hand. 

He went back to the boulder, 
and as he stooped to pick up the 
rifle, he heard the faint beginning 
of a rumble. He straightened 
swiftly to face the scarp that 
blotted out the star-strewn sky— 
and the rumble grew! 

¥N one leap, he was at Sipar’s 
side. He reached down and 
grasped the native by an arm, 
jerked it erect, held it on its feet 
Sipar’s eyes snapped open, blink- 
ing in the firelight 

The rumble had grown to a 
roar and there were thumping 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




noises, as of heavy boulders bounc> 
ing, and beneath the roar the silky, 
ominous rustle of sliding soil and 
rock. 

Sipar jerked its arm free of 
Duncan’s grip and plunged into the 
darkness. Duncan whirled and fol- 
lowed. 

They ran, stumbling in the dark, 
and behind them the roar of the 
sliding, bouncing rock became a 
throaty roll of thunder that filled 
the night from brim to brim. As 
he ran, Duncan could feel, in 
dread anticipation, the gusty 
breath of hurtling debris blowing 
on his neck, the crushing impact 
of a boulder smashing into him, 
the engulfing flood of tumbling 
talus snatching at his legs. 

A puff of billowing dust came 
out and caught them and they ran 
choking as well as stumbling. Off 
to the left of them, a mighty chunk 
of rock chugged along the ground 
in jerky, almost reluctant fashion. 

Then the thunder stopped and 
all one could hear was the small 
slitherings of the lesser debris as 
it trickled down the slope. 

Duncan stopped running and 
slowly turned around. The camp- 
fire was gone, buried, no doubt, 
beneath tons of overlay, and the 
stars had paled because of the 
great cloud of dust which still bil- 
lowed up into the sky. 

He heard Sipar moving near 
him and reached out a hand, 
searching for the tracker, not 



knowing exactly where it was. He 
found the native, grasped it by the 
shoulder and pulled it up beside 
him. 

Sipar was shivering. 

“It’s all right,” said Duncan. 

And it was all right, he reassured 
himself. He still had the rifle. The 
extra drum of ammunition and 
the knife were on his belt, the bag 
of rockahominy in his pocket The 
canteens were all they had lost— 
the canteens and the fire. 

“We’ll have to hole up some- 
where for the night,” Duncan said. 
“There are screamers on the 
loose.” 

Tf £ didn’t like what he was 
thinking, nor the sharp edge 
of fear that was beginning to 
crowd in upon him. He tried to 
shrug it off, but it still stayed with 
him, just out of reach. 

Sipar plucked at his elbow. 

“Thom thicket, mister. Over 
there. We could crawl inside. We 
would be safe from screamers.” 

It was torture, but they made 
it. 

“Screamers and you are taboo,” 
said Duncan, suddenly remember- 
ing. “How come you are afraid 
of them?” 

“Afraid for yoti, mister, mostly. 
Afraid for myself just a little. 
Screamers could forget They 
might not recognize me until too 
late. Safer here.” 

“I agree with you,” said Duncan. 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



125 




The screamers came and 
padded all about the thicket The 
beasts sniffed and clawed at the 
thorns to reach them, but finally 
went away. 

When morning came, Duncan 
and Sipar climbed the scarp, clam- 
bering over the boulders and the 
tons of soil and rock that covered 
their camping place. Following 
the gash cut by the slide, they 
clambered up the slope and finally 
reached the point of the slide’s be- 
ginning. 

There they found the depres- 
sion in which the poised slab of 
rock had rested and where the sup- 
porting soil had been dug away so 
that it could be started, with a 
push, down the slope above the 
campfire. 

And all about were the deeply 
sunken pug marks of the Cytha! 

IV 

N OW it was more than just a 
hunt. It was knife against the 
throat, kill or be killed. Now there 
was no stopping, when before there 
might have been. It was no longer 
sport and there was no mercy. 

“And that’s the way I like it,” 
IXincan told himself. 

He rubbed his hand along the 
rifle barrel and saw the metallic 
glints shine in the noonday sun. 
One more shot, he prayed. Just 
give me one more shot at it. This 
time there will be no slip-up. This 



time there will be more than diree 
sodden hunks of flesh and fur ly- 
ing in the grass to mock me. 

He squinted his eyes against the 
heat shimmer rising from the 
river, watching Sipar hunkered be- 
side the water’s edge. 

The native rose to its feet and 
trotted back to him. 

“It crossed,” said Sipar. “It 
walked out as far as it could go 
and it must have swum.” 

“Are you sure? It might have 
waded out to make us think it 
crossed, then doubled back again.” 

He stared at the purple-green of 
the trees across the river. Inside 
that forest, it would be hellish go- 
ing. 

“We can look,” said Sipar. 

“Good. You go downstream. I’ll 
go up.” 

An hour later, they were back. 
They had found no tracks. There 
seemed little doubt the Cytha had 
really crossed the river. 

They stood side by side, look- 
ing at the forest. 

“Mister, we have come far. You 
are brave to hunt the C}^tha. You 
have no fear of death.” 

“The fear of death,” Duncan 
said, “is entirely infantile. And it’s 
beside the point as well. I do not 
intend to die.” 

They waded out into the stream. 
The bottom shelved gradually and 
they had to swim no more than 
a hundred yards or so. 

They reached the forest bank 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and threw themselves flat to rest 
Duncan looked back the way 
that they had come. To the east, 
the escarpment was a dark>blue 
smudge against the pale-blue bur- 
nished sky. And two days back of 
that lay the farm and the vua field, 
but they seemed much farther off 
than that. They were lost in time 
and distance; they belonged to an- 
other existence and another world. 

All his life, it seemed to him, 
had faded and become inconse- 
quential and forgotten, as if this 
moment in his life were the only 
one that counted; as if all the 
minutes and the hours, all the 
breaths and heartbeats, wake and 
sleep, had pointed toward this cer- 
tain hour upon this certain stream, 
with the rifle molded to his hand 
and the cool, calculated bloodlust 
of a killer riding in his brain. 

S IPAR finally got up and began 
to range along the stream. 
Duncan sat up and watched. 

Scared to death, he thought, and 
yet it stayed with me. At the 
campfire that first night, it had 
said it would stick to the death 
and apparently it had meant exact- 
ly what it said. It’s hard, he 
thought, to figure out these jokers, 
hard to know what kind of mental 
operation, what seethings of emo- 
tion, what brand of ethics and 
what variety of belief and faith go 
to make them and their way of 
life. 



It would have been so easy for 
Sipar to have missed the trail and 
swear it could not find it. Even 
from the start, it could have re- 
fused to go. Yet, fearing, it had 
gone. Reluctant, it had trailed. 
Without any need for faithfulness 
and loyalty, it had been loyal and 
faithful. But loyal to what. Dim- 
can wondered, to him, the out- 
lander and intruder? Loyal to 
itself? Or perhaps, although that 
seemed impossible, faithful to the 
Cytha? 

What does Sipar think of me, 
he asked himself, and maybe more 
to the point, what do I think of 
Sipar? Is there a common meet- 
ing ground? Or are we, despite 
our humanoid forms, condemned 
forever to be alien and apart? 

He held the rifle across his 
knees and stroked it, polishing 
it, petting it, making it even more 
closely a part of him, an instru- 
ment of his deadliness, an expres- 
sion of his determination to track 
and kill the Cytha. 

Just another chance, he begged. 
Just one second, or even less, to 
draw a steady bead. That is all 
I want, all I need, all I’ll ask. 

Then he could go back across 
the days that he had left behind 
him, back to the farm and field, 
back into that misty other life 
from which he had been so mys- 
teriously divorced, but which in 
time undoubtedly would become 
real and meaningful again. 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



127 




Sipar came back. "I found die 
trail.” 

Duncan heaved himself to his 
feet. “Good.” 

They left the river and plunged 
into the forest and there the heat 
closed in more mercilessly than 
ever — humid, stifling heat that 
felt like a soggy blanket wrapped 
tightly round the body. 

The trail lay plain and clear. 
The Cytha now, it seemed, was 
intent upon piling up a lead with- 
out recourse to evasive tactics. 
Perhaps it had reasoned that its 
pursuers would lose some time at 
the river and it may have been 
trying to stretch out that margin 
even further. Perhaps it needed 
that extra time, he speculated, to 
set up the necessary machinery for 
another dirty trick. 

Sipar stopped and waited for 
Duncan to catch up. “Your knife, 
mister?” 

Duncan hesitated. “What for?” 

‘’I have a thorn in my foot,” the 
native said. “I have to get it out” 

Duncan pulled the knife from 
his belt and tossed it. Sipar caught 
it deftly. 

Looking straight at Duncan, 
with the flicker of a smile upon its 
lips, the native cut its throat. 

V 

TTE should go back, he knew. 

Without the tracker, he didn’t 
have a chance. The odds were 



now with the C5rtha—if, indeed, 
they had not been with it from the 
very start 

Unkillable? Unkillable because 
it grew in intelligence to meet 
emergencies? Unkillable because, 
pressed, it could fashion a bow and 
arrow, however crude? Unkillable 
because it had a sense of tactics, 
like rolling rocks at night upon its 
enemy? Unkillable because a na- 
tive tracker would cheerfully kill 
itself to protect the C3rtha? 

A sort of crisis-beast, perhaps? 
One able to develop intelligence 
and abilities to meet each new situ- 
ation and then lapsing back to the 
level of non-intelligent content- 
ment? That, thought Dxmcan, 
would be a sensible way for any- 
thing to live. It would do away 
with the inconvenience and the 
irritability and the discontentment 
of intelligence when intelligence 
was unneeded. But the intelligence, 
and the abilities which went with 
it, would be there, safely tucked 
away where one could reach in and 
get them, like a necklace or a gun 
—something to be used or to be 
put away as the case might be. 

Duncan hunched forward and 
with a stick of wood pushed the 
fire together. The flames blazed 
up anew and sent sparks flying up 
into the whispering darkness of 
the trees. The night had cooled 
off a little, but the humidity still 
hung on and a man felt uncom- 
fortable— a little frightened, too.

Duncan lifted his head and 
stared up into the hre>flecked 
darkness. There were no stars be- 
cause the heavy foliage shut them 
out. He missed the stars. He’d 
feel better if he could look up and 
see them. 

When morning came, he should 
go back. He should quit this hunt 
which now had become impossible 
and even slightly foolish. 

But he knew he wouldn’t. Some- 
where along the three-day trail, he 
had become committed to a pur- 
pose and a challenge, and he knew 
that when morning came, he would 
go on again. It was not hatred that 
drove him, nor vengeance, nor 
even the trophy-urge— the hunter- 
lust that prodded men to kill some- 
thing strange or harder to kill or 
bigger than any man had ever 
killed before. It was something 
more than that, some weird en- 
tangling of the Cytha’s meaning 
with his own. 

He reached out and picked up 
the rifle and laid it in his lap. Its 
barrel gleamed dully in the flicker- 
ing campfire light and he rubbed 
his hand along the stock as another 
man might stroke a woman’s 
throat. 

“Mister,” said a voice. 

TT did not startle him, for the 

word was softly spoken and 
for a moment he had forgotten 
that Sipar was dead— dead with 
a half-smile fixed upon its face 



and widi its throat laid wide open. 

“Mister?” 

Duncan stiffened. 

Sipar was dead and there was 
no one else— and yet someone had 
spoken to him, and there could 
be only one thing in all this wil- 
derness that might speak to him. 
“Yes,” he said. 

He did not move. He simply sat 
there, with the rifle in his lap. 
“You know who I am?” 

“I suppose you are the Cytha.” 
“You have done well,” the Cytha 
said. “You’ve made a splendid 
hunt. There is no dishonor if you 
should decide to quit. Why don’t 
you go back? I promise you no 
harm.” 

It was over there, somewhere 
in front of him, somewhere in the 
brush beyond the fire, almost 
straight across the fire from him, 
Duncan told himself. If he could 
keep it talking, perhaps even lure 
it out— 

“Why should I?” he asked. ‘The 
hunt is never done until one gets 
the thing one is after.” 

“I can kill you, the Cytha told 
him. “But I do not want to kill. 
It hurts to kill.” 

“That’s right,” said Duncan. 
“You are most perceptive.” 

For he had it pegged now. He 
knew exactly where it was. He 
could afford a little mockery. 

His thumb slid up the metal and 
nudged the fire control to auto- 
matic and he flexed his legs be- 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



129 




neath him so that he could rise 
and fire in one single motion. 

**Why did you hunt me?’’ the 
Cytha asked. “You are a stranger 
on my world and you had no right 
to hunt me. Not that I mind, of 
course. In fact, I found it stimu- 
lating. We must do it again. When 
I am ready to be hunted, I shall 
come and tell you and we can 
spend a day or two at it.” 

“Sure we can,” said Duncan, 
rising. And as he rose into his 
crouch, he held the trigger down 
and the gun danced in insane fury, 
the muzzle flare a flicking tongue 
of hatred and the hail of death 
hissing spitefully in the under- 
brush. 

“Anytime you want to,” yelled 
Duncan gleefully, “I’ll come and 
hunt you! You just say the word 
and I’ll be on your tail. I might 
even kill you. How do you like it, 
chump!” 

And he held the trigger tight 
and kept his crouch so the slugs 
would not fly high, but would cut 
their swath just above the ground, 
and he moved the muzzle back 
and forth a lot so that he covered 
extra ground to compensate for 
any miscalcuations he might have 
made. 

magazine ran out and the 
gun clicked empty and the 
vicious chatter stopped. Powder 
smoke drifted softly in the camp- 
fire light and the smell of it was 



perfume in the nostrils and in die 
underbrush many little feet were 
running, as if a thousand fright- 
ened mice were scurrying from 
catastrophe. 

Duncan unhooked the extra 
magazine from where it hung upon 
his belt and replaced the empty 
one. Then he snatched a burning 
length of wood from the fire and 
waved it frantically until it burst 
into a blaze and became a torch. 
Rifle grasped in one hand and the 
torch in the other, he plunged into 
the underbrush. Little chittering 
things fled to escape him. 

He did not find the Cytha. He 
found chewed-up bushes and soil 
churned by flying metal, and he 
found five lumps of flesh and fur, 
and these he brought back to the 
fire. 

Now the fear that had been 
stalking him, keeping just beyond 
his reach, walked out from the 
shadows and hunkered by the 
campfire with him. 

He placed the rifle within easy 
reach and arranged the five bloody 
chunks on the ground close to the 
fire and he tried with trembling 
fingers to restore them to the shape 
thes^d been before the bullets 
struck them. And that was a good 
one, he thought with grim irony, 
because they had no shape. They 
had been part of the C5^a and 
you killed a Cytha inch by inch, 
not with a single shot You 
knocked a pound of meat off it the 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




first time, and the next time you 
shot off another pound or two, and 
if you got enough shots at it, you 
finally carved it down to size and 
maybe you could kill it then, al- 
though he wasn’t sure. 

He was afraid. He admitted that 
he was and he squatted there and 
watched his fingers shake and he 
kept his jaws clamped tight to 
stop the chatter of his teeth. 

The fear had been getting closer 
all the time; he knew it had moved 
in by a step or two when Sipar 
cut its throat, and why in the name 
of God had the damn fool done 
it? It made no sense at all. He had 
wondered about Sipar’s loyalties, 
and the very loyalties that he 
had dismissed as a sheer impos- 
sibility had been the answer, after 
all. In the end, for some obscure 
reason — obscure to humans, that 
is— Sipar’s loyalty had been to the 
Cytha. 

But then what was the use of 
searching for any reason in it? 
Nothing that had happened made 
any sense. It made no sense that 
a beast one was pursuing should 
up and talk to one— although it 
did fit in with the theorj' of the 
crisis-beast he had fashioned in 
his mind. 

J3ROGRESSIVE adaptation, he 

told himself. Carry adaptation 
far enough and you’d reach com- 
munication. But might not the 
Cytha’s power of adaptation be 



running down? Had die Cytha 
gone about as far as it could force 
itself to go? Maybe so, he thought 
It might be worth a gamble. Sipar’s 
suicide, for all its casualness, bore 
the overtones of last-notch despera- 
tion. And the C 5 ^a’s speaking to 
Duncan, its attempt to parley with 
him, contained a note of weakness. 

The arrow had failed and the 
rockslide had failed and so had 
Sipar’s death. What next would 
the Cytha try? Had it anything to 
try? 

Tomorrow he’d find out Tomor- 
row he’d go on. He couldn’t turn 
back now. 

He was too deeply involved. 
He’d always wonder, if he turned 
back now, whether another hour 
or two might not have seen the 
end of it. There were too many 
questions, too much mystery — 
there was now far more at stake 
than ten rows of vua. 

Another day might make some 
sense of it, might banish the dread 
walker that trod upon his heels, 
might bring some peace of mind. 

As it stood right at the moment, 
none of it made sense. 

But even as he thought it, sud- 
denly one of the bits of bloody 
flesh and mangled fur made sense. 

Beneath the punching and prod- 
ding of his fingers, it had assumed 
a shape. 

Breathlessly, Duncan bent above 
it, not believing not even wanting 
to believe, hoping frantically that 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



131 




it should prove completely wrong. 

But there was nothing wrong 
with it. The shape was there and 
could not be denied. It had some- 
how fitted back into its natural 
shape and it was a baby screamer 
—well, maybe not a baby, but at 
least a tiny screamer. 

Duncan sat back on his heels 
and sweated. He wiped his bloody 
hands upon the ground. He won- 
dered what other shapes he’d find 
if he put back into proper place 
the other hunks of limpness that 
lay beside the fire. 

He tried and failed. They were 
too smashed and torn. 

He picked them up and tossed 
them in the fire. He took up his 
rifle and walked aroimd the fire, 
sat down with his back against a 
tree, cradling the gun across his 
knees. 

T hose little scurrying feet, he 
wondered— like the scampering 
of a thousand busy mice. He had 
heard them twice, that first night 
in the thicket by the waterhole and 
again tonight 

And what could the Cytha be? 
Certainly not the simple, uncom- 
plicated, marauding animal he had 
thought to start with. 

A hive-beast? A host animal? A 
thing masquerading in many dif- 
ferent forms? 

Shotwell, trained in such de- 
ductions, might make a fairly ac- 
curate guess, but Shotwell was not 



here. He was at the farm, fretting, 
more than likely, over Duncan’s 
failure to return. 

Finally the first light of morning 
began to filter through the forest 
and it was not the glaring, clean 
white light of the open plain and 
bush, but a softened, diluted, fuzzy 
green light to match the smother- 
ing vegetation. 

The night noises died away and 
the noises of the day took up— 
the sawings of unseen insects, the 
screechings of hidden birds and 
something far away began to make 
a noise that sounded like an empty 
barrel falling slowly down a stair- 
way. 

What little coolness the night 
had brought dissipated swiftly and 
the heat clamped down, a breath- 
less, relentless heat that quivered 
in the air. 

Circling, Duncan picked up the 
C3dha trail not more than a him- 
dred yards from camp. 

The beast had been traveling 
fast. The pug marks were deeply 
sunk and widely spaced. Duncan 
followed as rapidly as he dared. 
It was a temptation to follow at a 
run, to match the Cytha’s speed, 
for the trail was plain and fresh 
and it fairly beckoned. 

And that was wrong, Duncan 
told himself. It was too fresh, too 
plain— almost as if the animal had 
gone to endless trouble so that the 
human could not miss the trail. 

He stopped his trailing and 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




crouched beside a tree and studied 
the tracks ahead. His hands were 
too tense upon the gun, his body 
keyed too high and fine. He forced 
himself to take slow, deep breaths. 
He had to calm himself. He had 
to loosen up. 

He studied the tracks ahead- 
four bunched pug marks, then a 
long leap interval, then four more 
bunched tracks, and between the 
sets of marks the forest floor was 
innocent and smooth. 

Too smooth, perhaps. Especially 
the third one from him. Too 
smooth and somehow artificial, as 
if someone had patted it with 
gentle hands to make it unsuspi- 
cious. 

Duncan sucked his breath in 
slowly. 

Trap? 

Or was his imagination pla3nng 
tricks on him? 

And if it were a trap, he would 
have fallen into it if he had kept 
on following as he had started 
out. 

Now there was something else, 
a strange uneasiness, and he stirred 
uncomfortably, casting frantically 
for some clue to what it was. 

"IJE rose and stepped out from 
the tree, with the gun at 
ready. What a perfect place to set 
a trap, he thought. One would be 
looking at the pug marks, never 
at the space between them, for the 
space between would be neutral 



groimd, safe to stride out upon. 

Oh, clever Cytha, he said to him- 
self. Oh, clever, clever Csdha! 

And now he knew what the 
other trouble was— the great un- 
easiness. It was the sense of being 
watched. 

Somewhere up ahead, the Cj^tha 
was crouched, watching and wait- 
ing-anxious or exultant, maybe 
even with laughter rumbling in its 
throat. 

He walked slowly forward tm- 
til he reached the third set of 
tracks and he saw that he had 
been right. The little area ahead 
was smoother than it should be. 

“Cytha!” he called. 

His voice was far louder than 
he had meant it to be and he stood 
astonished and a bit abashed. 

Then he realized why it was so 
loud. 

It was the only sound there was! 

The forest suddenly had fallen 
silent. The insects and birds were 
quiet and the thing in the distance 
had quit falling down the stairs. 
Even the leaves were silent There 
was no rustle in them and they 
hung limp upon their stems. 

There was a feeling of doom 
and the green light had changed 
to a copper light and ever3rthing 
was still. 

And the light was copper! 

Duncan spun around in panic 
There was no place for him to 
hide. 

Before he could take another 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



133 




step, the skvtn came and the winds 
rushed out of nowhere. The air 
was clogged with flying leaves and 
debris. Trees snapped and popped 
and tumbled in the air. 

The wind hurled Duncan to his 
knees, and as he fought to regain 
his feet, he remembered, in a blind- 
ing flash of total recall, how it had 
looked from atop the escarpment 
—the boiling fury of the winds and 
the mad swirling of the coppery 
mist and how the trees had 
whipped in whirlpool fashion. 

He came half erect and stum- 
bled, clawing at the ground in an 
attempt to get up again, while in- 
side his brain an insistent, click- 
ing voice cried out for him to run, 
and somewhere another voice said 
to lie flat upon the ground, to dig 
in as best he could. 

Something struck him from be- 
hind and he went down, pinned 
flat, with his rifle wedged beneath 
him. He cracked his head upon the 
ground and the world whirled 
sickeningly and plastered his face 
with a handful of mud and tat- 
tered leavees. 

He tried to crawl and couldn’t, 
for something had grabbed him by 
the ankle and was hanging on. 

ITH a frantic hand, he 
clawed the mess out of his 
eyes, spat it from his mouth. 

Across the spiiming ground, 
something black and angular 
tumbled rapidly. It was coming 



straight toward him and he saw 
it was the Cytha and that in an- 
other second it would be on top of 
him. 

He threw up an arm across his 
face, with the elbow crooked, to 
take the impact of the wind-blown 
Cjrtha and to ward it off. 

But it never reached him. Less 
than a yard away, the ground 
opened up to take the Cytha and 
it was no longer there. 

Suddenly the wind cut off and 
the leaves once more hung motion- 
less and the heat clamped down 
again and that was the end of it 
The skun had come and struck 
and gone. 

Minutes, Duncan wondered, or 
perhaps no more than seconds. But 
in those seconds, the forest had 
been flattened and the trees lay 
in shattered heaps. 

He raised himself on an elbow 
and looked to see what was the 
matter with his foot and he saw 
that a fallen tree had trapped his 
foot beneath it. 

He tugged a few times experi- 
mentally. It was no use. Two close- 
set limbs, branching almost at 
right angles from the hole, had 
been driven deep into the ground 
and his foot, he saw, had been 
caught at the ankle in the fork 
of the buried branches. 

The foot didn’t hurt— not yet 
It didn’t seem to be there at all. 
He tried wiggling his toes and felt 
none. 




134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He wiped the sweat off his face 
with a shirt sleeve and fought to 
force down the panic that was ris- 
ing in him. Getting panicky was 
the worst thing a man could do 
in a spot like this. The thing to 
do was to take stock of the situ- 
ation, figure out the best approach, 
then go ahead and try it. 

The tree looked heavy, but per- 
haps he could handle it if he had 
to, although there was the danger 
that if he shifted it, the bole might 
settle more solidly and crush his 
foot beneath it. At the moment, 
the two heavy branches, thrust into 
the ground on either side of his 
ankle, were holding most of the 
tree’s weight off his foot. 

The best thing to do, he decided, 
was to dig the ground away be- 
neath his foot until he could pull 
it out. 

He twisted around and started 
digging with the fingers of one 
hand. Beneath the thin covering 
of humus, he struck a solid surface 
and his fingers slid along it. 

With mounting alarm, he ex- 
plored the ground, scratching at 
the humus. There was nothing but 
rock — some long-buried boulder, 
the top of which lay just beneath 
the ground. 

His foot was trapped beneath a 
heavy tree and a massive boulder, 
held securely in place by forked 
branches that had forced their 
splintering way down along the 
boulder’s sides. 



TTE lay back, propped on an el- 
bow. It was evident that he 
could do nothing about the buried 
boulder. If he was going to do 
anything, his problem was the 
tree. 

To move the tree, he would 
need a lever and he had a good, 
stout lever in his rifle. It would 
be a shame, he thought a little 
wryly, to use a gun for such a 
purpose, but he had no choice. 

He worked for an hour and it 
was no good. Even with the rifle 
as a pry, he could not budge the 
tree. 

He lay back, defeated, breathing 
hard, wringing wet with perspira- 
tion. 

He grimaced at the sky. 

All right, Cytha, he thought, 
you won out in the end. But it 
took a skun to do it. With all your 
tricks, you couldn’t do the job 
until . 

Then he remembered. 

He sat up hurriedly. 

“Cytha!” he called. 

The Cytha had fallen into a 
hole that had opened in the 
ground. The hole was less than an 
arm’s length away from him, with 
a little debris around its edges 
still trickling into it. 

Duncan stretched out his body, 
lying flat upon the ground, and 
looked into the hole. There, at 
the bottom of it, was the Cytha. 

It was the first time he’d gotten 
a good look at the Cytha and it 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



135 




was a crazily put-t(^ether 
It seemed to have nothing func- 
tional about it and it looked more 
like a heap of something, just 
thrown on the ground, than it did 
an animal. 

The hole, he saw, was more 
than an ordinary hole. It was a 
pit and very cleverly constructed. 
The mouth was about four feet 
in diameter and it widened to 
rou^ly twice that at the bottom. 
It was, in general, bottle-shaped, 
with an incurving shoulder at the 
top so that anything that fell in 
could not climb out. Anything fall- 
ing into that pit was in to stay. 

This, Duncan knew, was what 
had lain beneath that too-smooth 
interval between the two sets of 
Cytha tracks. The C5^tha had 
worked all night to dig it, then 
had carried away the dirt dug 
out of the pit and had built a 
flimsy camouflage cover over it. 
Then it had gone back and made 
the trail that was so loud and 
clear, so easy to make out and 
follow. And having done all that, 
having labored hard and stealthily, 
the C3^a had settled down to 
watch, to make sure the follow- 
ing human had fallen in the pit. 

pal,” said Duncan. “How 
are you making out?” 

The Cytha did not answer. 

“Classy pit,” said Duncan. “Do 
you always den up in luxury like 
this?” 




136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




But the Cytha didn’t answer. 

Something queer was happen- 
ii^ to the Cj^a. It was coming all 
apart 

Duncan watched with fascinated 
horror as the Cytha broke down 
into a thousand lumps of motion 
that scurried in the pit and tried 
to scramble up its sides, only to 
fall back in tiny showers of sand. 

Amid the scurrying lumps, one 
thing remained intact a fragile ob- 
ject that resembled nothing quite 
so much as the stripped skeleton 
of a Thanksgiving turkey. But it 
was a most extraordinary Thanks- 
giving skeleton, for it throbbed 
with pulsing life and glowed with 
a steady violet light. 

Chitterings and squeakings came 
out of the pit and the soft patter 
of tiny running feet, and as Dun- 
can’s eyes became accustomed to 
the darkness of the pit, he began 
to make out the forms of some 
of the scurrying shapes. There 
were tiny screamers and some 
donovans and sawmill birds and a 
bevy of kill-devils and something 
else as well. 

Duncan raised a hand and 
pressed it against his eyes, then 
took it quickly away. The little 
faces still were there, looking up 
as if beseeching him, with the 
white shine of their teeth and the 
white rolling of their eyes. 

He felt horror wrenching at his 
stomach and the sour, bitter taste 
of revulsion welled into his throat, 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



137 



but he fought it down, harking 
back to that day at the farm before 
they had started on the hunt. 

“I can track down anything but 
screamers, stilt-birds, longhorns 
and donovans,” Sipar had told him 
solemnly. “These are my taboos.” 

And Sipar was also their taboo, 
for he had not feared the dono- 
van. Sipar had been, however, 
somewhat fearful of the screamers 
in the dead of night because, the 
native had told him reasonably, 
screamers were forgetful. 

Forgetful of what! 

Forgetful of the Cytha-mother? 
Forgetful of the motley brood in 
which they had spent their child- 
hood? 

For that was the only answer to 
what was running in the pit and 
the whole, unsuspected answer to 
the enigma against which men like 
Shotwell had frustratedly banged 
their heads for years. 

CTRANGE, he told himself. All 
^ right, it might be strange, but 
if it worked, what difference did 
it make? So the planet’s deni- 
zens were sexless because there 
was no need of sex — what was 
wrong with that? It might, in fact, 
Duncan admitted to himself, head 
off a lot of trouble. No family 
spats, no triangle trouble, no fight- 
ing over mates. While it might be 
unexciting, it did seem downright 
peaceful. 

And since there was no sex, the 



Cytha species was the planetary 
mother — but more than just a 
mother. The C3^a, more than 
likely, was mother-father, incuba- 
tor, nursery, teacher and perhaps 
many other things besides, all 
rolled into one. 

In many ways, he thought, it 
might make a lot of sense. Here 
natural selection would be ruled 
out and ecology could be con- 
trolled in considerable degree and 
mutation might even be a matter 
of deliberate choice rather than 
random happenstance. 

And it would make for a poten- 
tial planetary unity such as no 
other world had ever known. 
Everything here was kin to every- 
thing else. Here was a planet 
where Man, or any other alien, 
must learn to tread most softly. 
For it was not inconceivable that, 
in a crisis or a clash of interests, 
one might find himself faced sud- 
denly with a unified and cooperat- 
ing planet, with every form of life 
making common cause against the 
interloper. 

The little scurrying things had 
given up; they’d gone back to 
their places, clustered around the 
pulsing violet of the Thanksgiv- 
ing skeleton, each one fitting into 
place until the C3dha had taken 
shape again. As if, Duncan told 
himself, blood and nerve and 
muscle had come back from a 
brief vacation to form the beast 
anew.

“Mister,” asked the Cjrtha, 
“what do we do now?” 

“You should know,” I^uncan 
told it. “You were the one who 
dug the pit.” 

“I split myself,” the Cytha said. 
“A part of me dug the pit and 
the other part that stayed on the 
surface got me out when the job 
was done.” 

“Convenient,” grunted Duncan. 

And it was convenient. That 
was what had happened to the 
Cytha when he had shot at it— 
it had split into all its component 
parts and had got away. And that 
night beside the waterhole, it had 
spied on him, again in the form 
of all its separate parts, from the 
safety of the thicket. 

“You are caught and so am I,” 
the Cytha said. “Both of us will die 
here. It seems a fitting end to our 
association. Do you not agree with 
me?” 

“I’ll get you out,” said Duncan 
wearily. “I have no quarrel with 
children.” 

TJE dragged the rifle toward him 
and unhooked the sling from 
the stock. Carefully he lowered the 
gun by the sling, still attached to 
the barrel, down into the pit. 

The Cytha reared up and 
grasped it with its forepaws. 

“Easy now,” Duncan cautioned. 
“You’re heavy. I don’t know if I 
can hold you.” 

But he needn’t have worried. 



The little ones were detaching 
themselves and scrambling up the 
rifle and the sling. They reached 
his extended arms and ran up 
them with scrabbling claws. Little 
sneering screamers and the comic 
stilt-birds and the mouse-size kill- 
devils that snarled at him as they 
climbed. And the little grinning 
natives — not babies, scarcely chil- 
dren, but small editions of full- 
grown humanoids. And the weird 
donovans scampering happily. 

They came climbing up his 
arms and across his shoulders and 
milled about on the ground be- 
side him, waiting for the others. 

And finally the Cytha, not 
skinned down to the bare bones of 
its Thanksgiving-turkey-size, but 
far smaller than it had been, 
climbed awkwardly up the rifle 
and the sling to safety. 

Duncan hauled the rifle up and 
twisted himself into a sitting po- 
sition. 

The Cytha, he saw, was reas- 
sembling. 

He watched in fascination a& the 
restless miniatures of the planet’s 
life swarmed and seethed like a 
hive of bees, each one clicking 
into place to form the entire beast. 

And now the Cytha was com- 
plete. Yet small— still small— no 
more than lion-size. 

“But it is such a little one,” 
Zikkara had argued with him that 
morning at the farm. “It is such 
a young one.” 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T BE 



139 




Just a young brood, no more 
than suckling infants— if suckling 
was the word, or even some kind 
of wild approximation. And 
through the months and years, the 
Cytha would grow, with the grow- 
ing of its diverse children, until 
it became a monstrous thing. 

It stood there looking at Dun- 
can and the tree. 

“Now,” said Duncan, “if you’ll 
push on the tree, I think that be- 
tween the two of us—” 

“It is too bad,” the C}^tha said, 
and wheeled itself about 

He watched it go loping off. 

“Hey!” he yelled. 

But it didn’t stop. 

He grabbed up the rifle and had 
it halfway to his shoulder before 
he remembered how absolutely 
futile it was to shoot at the Cytha. 

He let the rifle down. 

“The dirty, ungrateful, double- 
crossing—” 

He stopped himself. There was 
no profit in rage. When you were 
in a jam, you did the best you 
could. You figured out the prob- 
lem and you^ picked the course 
that seemed besT and you didn’t 
panic at the odds. 

He laid the rifle in his lap and 
started to hook up the sling and 
it was not till then that he saw the 
barrel was packed with sand and 
dirt. 

He sat numbly for a moment, 
thinking back to how close he had 
been to firing at the Cytha, and if 



that barrel was packed hard 
enough or deep enough, he might 
have had an exploding weapon in 
his hands. 

He had used the rifle as a crow- 
bar, which was no way to use a 
gun. That was one way, he told 
himself, that was guaranteed to 
ruin it. 

D uncan hunted around and 
found a twig and dug at the 
clogged muzzle, but the dirt was 
jammed too firmly in it and he 
made little progress. 

He dropped the twig and was 
hunting for another stronger one 
when he caught the motion in a 
nearby clump of brush. 

He watched closely for a mo- 
ment and there was nothing, so 
he resumed the hunt for a stronger 
twig. He found one and started 
poking at the muzzle and there 
was another flash of motion. 

He twisted around. Not more 
than twenty feet away, a screamer 
sat easily on its haunches. Its 
tongue was lolling out and it had 
what looked like a grin upon its 
face. 

And there was another, just at 
the edge of the clump of brush 
where he had caught the motion 
first. 

There were others as well, he 
knew. He could hear them sliding 
through the tangle of fallen trees, 
could sense the soft padding of 
their feet.

The executioners, he thought 

The Cytha certainly had not 
wasted any time. 

He raised the rifle and rapped 
the barrel smartly on the fallen 
tree, trying to dislodge the ob- 
struction in the bore. But it didn’t 
budge; the barrel still was packed 
with sand. 

But no matter— he’d have to fire 
anyhow and take whatever chance 
there was. 

He shoved the control to au- 
tomatic. and tilted up the muzzle. 

There were six of them now, 
sitting in a ragged row, grinning 
at him, not in any hurry. They 
were sure of him and there was 
no hurry. He’d still be there when 
they decided to move in. 

And there were others— on all 
sides of him. 

Once it started, he wouldn’t 
have a chance. 

“It’ll be expensive, gents,” he 
told them. 

And he was astonished at how 
calm, how coldly objective he 
could be, now that the chips were 
down. But that was the way it 
was, he realized. 

He’d thought, a while ago, how 
a man might suddenly find him- 
self face to face with an aroused 
and cooperating planet. Maybe 
this was it in miniature. 

The Cytha had obviously passed 
the word along: Man back there 
needs killing. Go and get him. 

Just like that, for a C5rtha would 



be the power here. A life force, 
the giver of life, the decider of 
life, the repository of all animal 
life on the entire planet. 

There was more than one of 
them, of course. Probably they had 
home districts, spheres of influ- 
ence and responsibility mapped 
out. And each one would be a 
power supreme in its own district. 

Momism, he thought with a sour 
grin. Momism at its absolute peak. 

Nevertheless, he told himself, 
it wasn’t too bad a system if you 
wanted to consider it objectively. 

But he was in a poor position to 
be objective about that or any- 
thing else. 

'T^HE screamers were inching 
-*■ closer, hitching themselves for- 
ward slowly on their bottoms. 

“I’m going to set up a deadline 
for you critters,” Duncan called 
out. “Just two feet farther, up to 
that rock, and I let you have it.” 

He’d get all six of them, of 
course, but the shots would be the 
signal for the general rush by all 
those other animals slinking in 
the brush. 

If he were free, if he were on 
his feet, possibly he could beat 
them off. But pinned as he was, 
he didn’t have a chance. It would 
be all over less than a minute 
after he opened fire. He might, he 
figured, last as long as that. 

The six inched closer and he 
raised the rifle. 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE 



141 




But they stopped and moved 
no farther. Their ears lifted just a 
little, as if they might be listening, 
and the grins dropped from their 
faces. They squirmed uneasily and 
assumed a look of guilt and, like 
shadows, they were gone, melting 
away so swiftly that he scarce- 
ly saw them go. 

Duncan sat quietly, listening, 
but he could hear no sound. 

Reprieve, he thought. But for 
how long? Something had scared 
them off, but in a while they might 
be back. He had to get out of 
here and he had to make it fast. 

If he could find a longer lever, 
he could move the tree. There was 
a branch slanting up from the 
topside of the fallen tree. It was 
almost four inches at the butt and 
it carried its diameter well. 

He slid the knife from his belt 
and looked at it. Too small, too 
thin, he thought, to chisel through 
a four-inch branch, but it was all 
he had. When a man was desperate 
enough, though, when his very life 
depended on it, he would do any- 
thing. 

He hitched himself along, slid- 
ing toward the point where the 
branch protruded from the tree. 
His pinned leg protested with stabs 
of pain as his body wrenched it 
around. He gritted his teeth and 
pushed himself closer. Pain slashed 
through his leg again and he was 
still long inches from the branch. 

He tried once more, then gave 



up. He lay panting on the ground. 

There was just one thing left 

He*d have to try to hack out a 
notch in the trunk just above his 
leg. No, that would be next to 
impossible, for he’d be cutting into 
the whorled and twisted grain at 
the base of the supporting fork. 

Either that or cut off his foot, 
and that was even more impos- 
sible. A man would faint before he 
got the job done. 

It was useless, he knew. He 
could do neither one. There was 
nothing he could do. 

I^OR the first time, he admitted 

to himself : He would stay here 
and die. Shotwell, back at the farm, 
in a day or two might set out hunt- 
ing for him. But Shotwell would 
never find him. And anyhow, by 
nightfall, if not sooner, the scream- 
ers would be back. 

He laughed gruffy in his throat 
—laughing at himself. 

The Cytha had won the hunt 
hands down. It had used a human 
weakness to win and then had used 
that same human weakness to 
achieve a viciously poetic ven- 
geance. 

After all, what could one expect? 
One could not equate human 
ethics with the ethics of the Cytha. 
Might not human ethics, in cer- 
tain cases, seem as weird and il- 
logical, as infamous and ungrate- 
ful, to an alien? 

He hunted for a twig and be-

gan working again to clean the 
rifle bore. 

A crashing behind him twisted 
him around and he saw the Cytha. 
Behind the Cytha stalked a dono- 
van. 

He tossed away the twig and 
raised the gun. 

“No,” said the Cytha sharply. 

The donovan tramped purpose- 
fully forward and Duncan felt the 
prickling of the skin along his 
back. It was a frightful thing. 
Nothing could stand before a dono- 
van. The screamers had turned 
tail and run when they had heard 
it a couple of miles or more away. 

The donovan was named for 
the first known human to be killed 
by one. That first was only one 
of many. The roll of donovan- 
victims ran long, and no wonder, 
Duncan thought. It was the closest 
he had ever been to one of the 
beasts and he felt a coldness creei> 
ing over him. It was like an ele- 
phant and a tiger and a grizzly 
bear wrapped in the selfsame 
hide. It was the most vicious fight- 
ing machine that ever had been 
spawned. 

He lowered the rifle. There 
would be no point in shooting. In 
two quick strides, the beast could 
be upon him. 

The donovan almost stepped on 
him and he flinched away. Then 
the great head lowered and gave 
the fallen tree a butt and the tree 
boimced for a yard or two. The 



donovan kept on walking. Its pow- 
erfully muscled stem moved into 
the brush and out of sight 
“Now we are even,” said the 
Cytha. “I had to get some help.” 
Duncan grunted. He flexed the 
leg that had been trapped and he 
could not feel the foot. Using his 
rifle as a cane, he pulled himself 
erect. He tried putting weight on 
the injured foot and it screamed 
with pain. 

He braced himself with the rifle 
and rotated so that he faced the 
Cytha. 

“Thanks, pal,” he said. “I didn’t 
think you’d do it.” 

“You will not hunt me now?” 
Duncan shook his head. “I’m in 
no shape for hunting. I am head- 
ing home.” 

“It was the vua, wasn’t it? That 
was why you hunted me?” 

“The vua is my livelihood,” said 
Duncan. “I cannot let you eat it.” 
The Cytha stood silently and 
Duncan watched it for a moment. 
Then he wheeled. Using the rifle 
for a crutch, he started hobbling 
away. 

The Cytha hurried to catch up 
with him. 

“Let us make a bargain, mis- 
ter. I will not eat the vua and you 
will not hunt me. Is that fair 
enough?” 

“That is fine with me,” said 
Duncan. “Let us shake on it.” 

He put down a hand and the 
C5^tha lifted up a paw. They shook, 



THE WORLD THAT COULDN’T BE

somewhat awkwardly, but very 
solemnly. 

“Now," the Cytha said, “I will 
see you home. The screamers 
would have you before you got out 
of the woods.” 

VI 

^^HEY halted on a knoll. Below 
them lay the farm, with the 
vua rows straight and green in the 
red soil of the fields. 

“You can make it from here,” 
the Cytha said. “I am wearing thin. 
It is an awful effort to keep on 
being smart. I want to go back 
to ignorance and comfort.” 

“It was nice knowing you,” Dun- 
can told it politely. “And thanks 
for sticking with me.” 

He started down the hill, lean- 
ing heavily on the rifle-crutch. 
Then he frowned troubledly and 
turned back. 

“Look,” he said, “you’ll go back 
to animal again. Then you will 
forget. One of these days, you’ll 



see all that nice, tender vua and—” 

“Very simple,” said the Cytha. 
“If you find me in the vua, just 
begin hunting me. With you after 
me, I will quickly get smart and 
remember once again and it will 
be all right.” 

“Sure,” agreed Duncan. “I guess 
that will work.” 

The Cytha watched him go 
stumping down the hill. 

Admirable, it thought. Next time 
I have a brood, I think I’ll raise 
a dozen like him. 

It turned around and headed 
for the deeper brush. 

It felt intelligence slipping from 
it, felt the old, uncaring comfort 
coming back again. But it glowed 
with anticipation, seethed with 
happiness at the big surprise it 
had in store for its new-found 
friend. 

Won’t he be happy and sur- 
prised when I drop them at his 
door, it thought. 

Will he be ever pleased!
