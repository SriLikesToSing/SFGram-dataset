Worlds} of When... 



A s professional forward-lookers 

A we science-fiction writers some- 
times lose sight of the fact that 
others are in the business as well. 
A group specializing in “when-ness’’ 
are the computer people of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Techno- 
logy» and a first-rate book summariz- 
ing their opinions about what to- 
morrow will look like is Computers 
and the World of the Future (MIT 
Press), which Martin Greenberger 
assembled out of transcripts of a 
lecture and discussion series held at 
MIT a while ago. 

The contributors to the lecture 
series include Vannevar Bush, Mar- 
vin L. Minsky (perhaps best known 
to the lay public as the inventor of 
the Minsky i! n, a computer pro- 
gram which displays what are essen- 
tiaUy complete universes on a cath- 
ode tube), John R. Pierce, C. P. 
Snow, the late Norbert Wiener and 
any number of other articulate and 
inform men and women. 

We don’t propose to review the 
book here; we only want to tell you 
that it is a rewarding reading ex- 
perience. Everybody knows about 
the job — doing capacities of the com- 
puter, how it measures out the pro- 
portions of meats that go into bolog- 
na, makes out payrolls, runs oil re- 
fineries, etc. But did you ever think 
of computer programming as an art 
form? More than 300,000,000 words 
of programming are written a year; 
the Library of Congress has recently 



amended its rules to permit copy- 
righting a program; and it seems at 
least a possibility that Composing a 
program for a computer to operate 
may very shortly attain the same 
cultural and philosophical standing 
as composing a symphony. 

Indeed, “possibility”, is too thin 
and remote a word. A number of 
the book’s contributors speak of the 
esthetic enjoyment of preparing 
“software” (i.e., the programs, etc. 
— as distinguished from the “hard- 
ware” of the machines themselves) 
for computers. 

The implications for a word- 
worker like the undersigned, who 
has been cheerfully viewing the cy- 
bernation revolution as one thfU 
meant serious dislocations for stee^ 
workers and subway motor men — 
but surely not for himself! — are 
fascinating, and a little frightening. 
One can imagine some future If is 
the form of binary codes, proceed- 
ing through some latter-day 7090*s 
input into a quantified readout like 
the Minskytron . 

But not today, at any rate. Today 
there’s //, and as John Pierce says 
in one of his remarks in this book, 
speculation “is the only way we 
have of giving variety to the future. 
When the future comes there is go- 
ing to be just one future, but here 
in anticipation we can enjoy a lot 
of different futures.” 

And we did. We enjoyed the whole 
book! —THE EDITOR

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
tome — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
diose who understand them. Behind 
die tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
fheir amazing discoveries of the hich 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
usastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
fiicts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri-

STARCHILD 

by JACK WILLIAMSON & FREDERIK POHL 



First of Three Parts 



Illustrated by MORROW 



This was the day when the sun 
went out— and mankind shook 
ot the name of the Starchildl 



I 

I t was the day, the hour and 
the moment of Earth’s vernal 
equinox . and the near stars 
blinked. 

A dozen of them flickered at 
once. Blazing Sirius and its dense 



dwarf sister. The bright ye0o9 
twins of Alpha Centauri. Faint red 
Proxima . the distant sparks of 
Eta Eridani and 70 Ophiuchi A . , 
the bright Sun itself. 

The vast cosmic engines declared 
a vacation in their processes: th|| 
fusion of smaller atoms into larg^ 



6 



the flow of surplus mass into 
energy, the filtration of that energy 
through layered seas of restless gas, 
the radiation of their atomic power 
into space. 

By the shores of Earth’s oceans, 
within the crater walls of Luna, on 
the sands of Mars and the ringed 
satellites of Saturn, out past the 
Spacewall to the reefs, the great 
billion-headed human race stirred 
and shook and knew fear. The 
whisper spread out into the galaxy, 
propagated at the speed of light; 
**The Starchildr 

Tliat was the way it began. 

The flickering of the neighbor 
stars lasted only a moment, and it 
was seen first on the reefs nearest 
each star. Then slow Pluto caught 
the twinkle of 70 Ophiuchi A while 
Neptune, lumbering in its dark or- 
bit on tile far side of Sol, was the 
first to catch the dimming of white- 
hot Sirius. On Earth, where the fat 
old Planner sat chuckling on his 
golden chair, every momentary 
pulse of darkness arrived at once. 
His chuckles stopped. His pouchy 
face darkened. As his astronomers 
reported in, he exploded in wrath. 

His first reports came from a 
hardened station in the zone of 
twilight on the planet Mercury, 
where sliding concrete doors un- 
covered a pit beneath a saw-toothed 
crater rim. 

A silvered dome pushed out of 
the pit, out of the ragged shadow, 
into the white blaze of the near 
sun. The barrels of a dozen opti- 
cal and radio telescopes, pyro- 
meters, telescanners and cameras 
thrust out at the great orb, under 



the blazoned slogan that the dome 
displayed to the universe in letteri 
of cast bronze: 

THE MIGHTIEST REWARDS 
THE MOST FAITHFUL 
And inside the insulated, refrig- 
erated observatory, three astrono- 
mers watched a thousand boards 
and gauges and dials. They wen 
waiting. 

For they had been warned. 

T he senior office on duty lifted 
his eyes from a chrononaeter 
dial and growled: 

“Five minutes!” 

The other two men squinted at 
their instruments in silence. The 
grizzled Technicaptain peered at 
them through the pale lighting of 
screen that dominated the glitter of 
instruments. On it swam the visual 
image of the sun, golden and en- 
gorged, reaching out with fat, slow 
tendrils of superheated gas as it 
lay above the rock-fanged horizon 
of the planet Mercury. 

“Yeah,” he grumbled, half to 
himself. “We^re ready.” 

The junior member of the team 
was a lean young Technicadet, an 
ambitious young man, already en»- 
bittered by the harsh facts of sur- 
vival and promotion in the Techni- 
corps. He dared a comment: 
“Ready for nothing, if you ask me. 
This is idiot business!” 

The senior officer rolled a yel- 
lowed eye toward Mm, but said no- 
thing. 

' “So?” murmured the third man. 

He was a plump little Techtenant 
who had found a satisfying philos- 
ophy in his recent promotion. “The 

F 



STARCHILO 




Machine’s business is idiotic, then?” 
“Now, looki I didn’t mean — ” 
“No. But you didn’t think, either. 
The Machine discerns the greater 
plan; we only execute the parts. If 
the Machine attaches importance to 
this fanciful creature, the Starchild, 
then we may not question its mo- 
tives.” 

The Tcchnicadet gestured at the 
huge solar globe angrily and cried: 
“Look! What could put that out?” 
The Techtenant shrugged, and 
the senior officer only said: 

“Four minutes.” 

The cadet’s military courtesy was 
worn thin under the abrasion of 
their long, tense vigil. He scowled 
at his telemetering pyrometers and 
grumbled: “Not a flicker! We’ve 
been here three miserable weeks, 
and we haven’t seen a thing.” 

The Technicaptain rumbled: 
“We’ll stay here three years if the 
Machine orders it. The Machine is 
above injustice or error. The Ma- 
chine was built to rule the Plan, 
and it is guarded against human 
blunders.” 

“Oh, yes, sir. But tw*ve seen 
nothing at ah,” cried the Techni- 
cadet. “No l^archild. No major 
sunspots — or whatever it is we are 
supposed to expect.” 

“Practice patience,” advised the 
fat captain. “Or you may find your- 
self serving the Plan more person- 
ally. There is always a need for 
spare parts in the Body Bank! 
Three minutes.” 

T he Technicadet subside ? grud- 
gingly apologetic. aI» three 
men sat strapped in their ob- 



servation chairs, watching the great 
golden image of the sun. Wreathed 
in its red coronal streamers, pocked 
in its middle latitudes with a trail 
of small black spots, it hung over 
the black horizon like a god’s eye. 
The instruments around them 
clicked and murmured. 

“I remember,” the Techtenant said 
at last, as though to himself, “when 
that sun was only another star in 
the sky. No brighter even than 
great Vega.” 

The Technicadet cried eagerly: 
“You were out in the Reefs?” 

“Two minutes,” growled the cap- 
tain, but his eyes were on the young 
Techtenant. 

He nodded. “Looking for my sis- 
ter’s — boy friend? Fiancee? Look- 
ing for Boysie Gann. Because he 
was looking for the Starchild. And 
we didn’t find either of them.” 

The cadet said simply, “I’ve nev- 
er seen the Reefs.” 

“A beautiful thing,” said the 
Techtenant. “There are spiked for- 
ests of silicon plants, shining with 
their own light. Like jewels, and 
sharp enough to shred your space- 
suit. There’s a growth that makes 
great brain-shaped masses of pure 
silver. There are thick stalks of 
platinum and gold, and there are 
things like flowers that are dia- 
monds.” 

The cadet’s breathing was sud- 
denly loud. The grizzled old ca^ 
tain turned to look at him, all his 
recent scorn now frozen into long- 
ing — and a sort of fear. He 
snapped: “Pay attention to your 
work man! The Reefs are danger- 
ous business!” 











STARCHIU) 



“Yes, sir,” the Tech tenant agreed 
earnestly. “I saw a great beast like 
a nightmare, shaped like a scorpion, 
huge as a horse — ” 

“No, you f0ol! Dangerous to the 
Plan of Man. There is something 
there that nearly destroyed us once. 
If the Starchild has his way — ” 

He stopped himself and only 
said: 

“One minute.” 

The Techtenant reddened. “Fm 
sorry, sir. I certainly did not intend 
to seem unplanned. I don’t mean 
to suggest that those savage no- 
mads beyond the Spacewall are 
worth considering, even if they do 
believe the Starchild to be more 
than human.” 

“Tend your instruments!” The 
captain set the example, resolutely 
taking his eyes from the men and 
the screen, clamping them on the 
bank of gauges and dials before 
him. A vagrant thought stirred his 
mind of the blonde Togetherness 
girl who had first whispered the 
name of the Starchild to him. What 
had become of her? The Body 
Bank? 

— But there was no time for 
that. It was only seconds now. 

In spite of all the insulation and 
the cold air sighing from the vents, 
the dome was suddenly stifling. The 
captain feH a tickle of perspiration 
running down his sides. “Twenty 
seconds!” 

The captain stood with his eyes 
frozen on the black chronometer 
needle that raced to meet the red, 
still one he had set. When they 
touched it would be the vernal 
equinox on Earth. And the Star- 



child’s threat would be proved an 
empty bluff — Or would not. 

Suddenly the whisper of the in- 
struments changed. A camera shut- 
ter began clicking gently. 

“Ten seconds!” 

The shielded floor lamps shut 
themselves off. Only the instrument 
lights rivaled the phosphor glow 
from the image of the great yellow 
sun in the screen. 

“Five seconds! ..«. Four! ... 
Three! . .” 

— twenty reels of tape began to 
spin shrilly in the darkness; the 
breathing of the men was like 

sobs — 

“Two! . One! . .. 

“Zero.'” 

The captain gulped and rubbed 

his eyes. 

There was a dimming. Then the 
filters went down and then there was 
a burst of flame — then darkness. 

The lights were gone. All of 
them. The sun’s image had winked 
out. He heard a gasp from one of 
the other men, then a shout: “The 
Starchild! He’s done it!” 

And the other man sobbed: 
“We’re blind!” 

T hat, too, was how it began. 
But there was more. 

Like a ripple from a pebble 
dropped into a still pond, a wave 
of darkness spread out from the 
sun. Three minutes after the in- 
stant of the vernal equinox it 
reached that clucking camera in the 
dome on Mercury, unseen by those 
sightless eyes. 

In not quite three more minutes, 
it struck the men watching from 



10 



IF 




the orbital stations above the eter- 
nal hot, dank clouds of Venus. A 
falling shadow of fear, it darkened 
tiieir screens, whitened their faces, 
silenced their talk. But their instru- 
ment lights remained visible. They 
had not been blinded by that last 
great burst of light from the sun. 

Eight minutes from the sun, the 
wave of blackness washed over 
Earth. All across the sunward face 
of the planet a crushing night came 
down. Bewildered, men paused and 
fumbled through the endless sec- 
onds before the city lights came 
on. Terror electrified those who 
bad heard the whisper of the Star- 
child’s threat. On the dark side of 
Earth and on Luna, astronomers 
blenched as their near, familiar 
stars flickered. Some had heard 
whispers of the Starchild, too, and 
of a Writ of Liberation. Others 
merely knew that the images in 
their great spaceborne mirrors, or 
in the scopes that peered up from 
Earth’s highest mountains, sudden- 
ly were missing familiar points of 
light. They came back — 

But the sun did not Not then. 
Not for half an hour and more, 
and while it was gone there was 
panic. 

To the Planner on bis great 
golden chair the news cane and 
quenched his chuckling good hu- 
mor, His huge soft face turned pale 
with fear. 

To a man named Boysie Gann, 
locked in the dungeons of the Ma- 
chine, no word came — but he 
knew. For he heard a guard whis- 
per to another, **The Starchild r 

To a girl with haunted dark eyes. 



telling whispering sonic beads be- 
fore a console of the Machine, the 
word came in a language that Man 
had not invented, and few men 
could understand. Her name was 
Delta Four, and she did not fear. 
She did not care at all. And 
that was how it began for them, 
and the wave of darkness raced on 
into infinite space. 

Twelve minutes from the sun it 
swept Mars, halting the dedication 
of an enormous new project to ex- 
tract oxygen and water from the 
dead crust of the planet. The Dep- 
uty Planner of Mars, a poorly 
planned individual who had seen 
the Writ of Liberation with his own 
eyes, snatched a gun from his hon- 
or guard and shot himself. 

During the following quarter- 
hour that shadow bathed the aster- 
oids, terrified a few, left others un- 
concerned. For they either did not 
know, being buried in the mining 
shafts that hollowed out the pre- 
cious cores of the tiny planets, or 
they were so dazed and uncaring 
with the eternal hardship of their 
toil that nothing could frighten 
them again. 

The racing wave of light over- 
took the scattered outposts of the 
Plan on the Moons of Jupiter. It 
darkened Saturn’s rings, swallowed 
the satellites of Uranus and Nep- 
tune. It fell upon (the Spacewall 
Command complex cm distant 
Pluto, where only those whose eyes 
fell upon the sun by chance noticed 
it — but they were afraid. 

It drowned the Spacewall itself — 
more web than wall, a net of far- 
scattered stations whose laser beams 



STARCHILD 



11 




and patrol craft kept watch on the 
little-known infinities beyond, alert 
to guard the Plan of Man against 
vagrants from the Reefs, or such en- 
emies as the Starchild. 

A wave of unexpected terror, it 
sent the crews of a thousand slow- 
wheeling spaceforts shouting to 
their emergency stations. It awak- 
ened sirens and horns on ten thou- 
sand lonely patrol ships. It set the 
laser beams winking with a million 
signals of confused alarm. 

A day or so beyond Pluto it 
washed the frontiers of the solar 
system, the snowball protoplanets 
of solid methane and ammonia 
which the distant gravitational arms 
of the sun had never gathered in- 
to actual worlds. 

And then at last, days beyond 
that last fearful outpost of the 
Plan, it began to bathe the Reefs 
of Space. 

O ut on the reefs, those living 
asteroids grown through un- 
ending ages by the minute fusorian 
organisms, feeding on the thin seas 
of interstellar' hydrogen, the wave 
of shadow no longer meant terror. 
It was only another event, in a life 
that was filled with danger and sur- 
prise. 

On one lonely worldlet a pros- 
pector stopped to peer in annoy- 
ance at where the sun had been. 
He fumbled in his pack for a lumi- 
nous crystal of fusorian diamond, 
and bent over his drill again. 

On another reef a lay preacher 
in the Church of the Star glanced 
at his watch, then at the sky. He 
was not afraid when he saw that 



Sol was gone from its accustomed 
position. 

He had been expecting it. 

He left his work to face the 
blue blaze of Deneb; knelt, whis- 
pered a few words of supplication 
and thanksgiving. Calmly then he 
bent back to the unfinished space 
boot on his last, for he was by 
trade a cobbler. 

The shadow washed over a 
grave, but no one saw it. No one 
could have, for no one was there. 
Not even the cadaver; the grave 
was empty. 

The shadow rested lightly on a 
city of stern, hard-faced refugees 
from the Plan of Man — on a 
great cluster of reeflets where a 
mighty space armada was being 
fashioned from fusorian steel — on 
a girl named Quarla Snow, who 
stood watching it flicker out with 
tears bright in her eyes. 

On another living rock, a herds- 
man stood guarding a calving 
member of his herd from a flight 
of marauding pyropods. Lying be- 
hind a sheltering ledge of organic 
iron, one eye on his parturient 
spaceling while he searched out the 
armored killers with frugal flashes 
from his laser gun, he failed to no- 
tice that the sun had gone out. 

That was how it began, for every 
man, woman and child alive. 

A nd thirty-nine minutes later 
the sun began again its mighty 
outpouring of heat and light, but 
the wave of brilliance that followed 
the dark looked down on a changed 
solar system. 

The sun's atomic engines ran 

IF 



12 




again. Hydrogen fused into helium, 
through the carbon cycle. Filtered 
energy flowed toward the solar sur- 
face. Radiation poured into space. 

Three minutes from the sun, the 
wave of radiation crashed against 
that insulated dome on Mercury. 
It was recorded by the clucking 
camera, analyzed by the thousand 
automatic instruments. Sobbing 
with joy — or fear! — the blinded 
astronomers flashed the word to 
Earth: The sun lives again! 

But its light reached Earth before 
tiieir message. 

That first rebirth of light brush- 
ed a high mountain on Earth, 
where the Planner sat on his golden 
chair, the gray metal falcon that 
perched on his shoulder darting a 
red-eyed glare about the room, 
whirring its steel wings. The Plan- 
ner was staring at a sheet of 
creamy parchment which bore the 
heading: 

WRIT OF LIBERATION 

It had been delivered to him by 
Ihe hand of one of his own guards, 
who had found it at his door. It 
•aid: 

The Starchild requires the 
release of all of his followers 
who are held in the service of 
the Plan of Man by security 
collars. 

The Starchild requires that 
all of his followers who have 
been consigned to the Body 
Bank for salvage shall be re- 
stored to their original state, 
and then that they too shall be 
released. 

The Starchild finally requires 
STARCHILD 



that the barrier called the 

Spacewall shall be dismantled, 
and that free passage between 
the worlds of the Plan and the 
Reefs of Space shall be per- 
mitted. 

The Starchild is aware that 
the Plan of Man considers itself 
invulnerable, and thus he has 
arranged a warning demonstra- 
tion. At the moment of the ver- 
nal equinox on Earth the sun 
will be extinguished. Twelve 
near stars will blink. 

If the Planner fails to meet 
the Starchild’s requirements af- 
ter this demonstration, further 
measures will be taken. These 
will result in the destruction 
of the Plan of Man. 

‘‘Unplanned nonsense,” groaned 
the Planner. “Impudence! Treason!” 
A tall Technicolonel said uneas- 
ily, “Sir. We must take measures . 

“Measures,” grumbled the Plan- 
ner, while his steel falcon clashed 
its pinions. “What does the Ma- 
chine say?” 

A girl in a hooded gown said: 
“No data, sir.” Her voice was like 
distant music, her expression serene. 

“No data! Find me some data! 
Find who this Starchild is! Tell me 
how he did this thing — and how 
I can stop him from doing it again!” 
The Technicolonel coughed. “Sir, 
for some years we have had reports 
of a Church of the Star. A new 
religion, apparently springing from 
the Reefs — ” 

“Always the Reefs! They should 
have been destroyed twenty years 
ago!” 

“Yes, sir. But they were not. And 
the pioneers — that is, sir, the 
tramps and vagabonds on the 

n 




Reefs — they invented new supersti- 
tions. They worship, I believe, tfio 
star Deneb. Alpha Cygni — the star 
at the top of the Northern Cross. 
They have imagined a paradise on 
the planets that they imagine to or- 
bit around it. They wish to migrate 
there, or some of them do — 
though at maximum drive for con- 
ventional spacecraft,” he continued 
earnestly, ‘‘they might average some 
one per cent of the speed of light, 
in which case Deneb, at four hun- 
dred light-years distance, would not 
be reached for forty thousand — 

“Get to the pointi” cried the 
Planner fretfully. “What about the 
Starchild?” 

“Well, sir, we had heard rumors 
of such a person in our investiga- 
tions of this cult. Sometime ago we 
decided to send a — uh — a special 
investigator to secure intelligence 
concerning him and it. The inves- 
tigator’s name was Boysie Gann, 
sir, and — ” 

“Bring him to me! Is he here on 
Earth?” 

“Yes, sir. But — well, sir, he did 
not return as we expected. In 
fact — ” the Colonel’s face was a 
picture-puzzle of confusion — “I 
must confess, sir, that we don’t 
properly know how he did return, 
as — ” 

“Fool!” shouted the Planner. 
“Bring him to me! Never mind 
what you don’t know. Bring me 
Boysie Gann!” 

. And that too was how it be- 
gan; but in fact some parts of it 
began earlier. 

For Boysie Gann it began many 
months earlier, when he was a spy. 



U 

F or Boysie Gann the beginning 
was on Polaris Station, that 
great metal wheel that floats in the 
icy space past Pluto, one link in 
die Spacewall between the Plan of 
Man planets and the Reefs. 

Boysie Gann was twenty-six years 
old and already a Machine Major. 

Boysie Gann was six feet tall, 
brown-haired, blue-eyed. He was 
broad through the shoulders and 
slim at the waist. He moved like 
a cheerful cat. He looked like a 
fighter, and he was. 

He reported aboard the Polaris 
Station with a grin and a disarm- 
ing look out of his bright blue 
eyes. “Boysie Gann reporting, sir,” 
he told the deck officer. “Techni- 
cadet Gann, at your service.” And 
that was a cheerful lie. He was no 
cadet, but at the spy school on 
Pluto the briefing officers had given 
him a new rank to make his job 
easier. A Machine Major was a 
man of importance. He would be 
watched. A cadet could go any- 
where, see anything. 

The deck officer assigned him 
quarters, procured him help in 
stowing his gear, shook his hand to 
welcome him aboard, and ordered 
him to report to the commandant 
of the Station, Machine Colond 
Mohammed Zafar. 

Gann’s assignment was to inves- 
tigate rumors of strange anti-Plan 
activities on the Polaris Station. 
Gann was a soldier of the Plan, 
and he could hardly conceive of 
anything anti-Plan that was not at 
the same time corrupt, slovenly.

evil and wrong. He had come to 
the station expecting to find it run- 
down and rusty, manned by surly 
malcontents. 

Yet the discipline was good. The 
men were on their toes. On the 
way through the plastic passages of 
the wheel, stepping high in the light 
gravity of the station’s spin, he saw 
that the metalwork was bright. 
Confusing, thought Gann, mildly 
perplexed; but he knew his duty 
and he knew how to do it. 

He knocked on the door of the 
commandant’s office and was or- 
dered inside. He came to full at- 
tention and a brisk salute. 

“Technicadet Gann reporting as 
ordered, sir!” 

The. Machine Colonel returned 
his salute methodically. Here, too, 
Gann was faintly surprised, though 
he allowed none of the surprise to 
show through his military bearing 
and engaging grin. Machine Colo- 
nel Zafar was a short brown man 
in meticulously pressed dress whites, 
who looked as solid and enduring 
as the Plan itself. “Welcome aboard, 
cadet,” he said. “Give me your or- 
ders, please.” 

“Yes, sir!” Gann’s orders were al- 
so a lie. They showed him to be a 
relief laser operator fresh out from 
Earth. They did not mention his 
true rank, or his intensive training 
on Pluto. The commandant read 
them carefully, then nodded. 

“Cadet Gann,” he said in his soft, 
precise voice, “we are glad to have 
you on Polaris Station. As you 
know, this station is a major unit 
in the Spacewalk Our primary job 
is to detect and intercept any un- 



authorized traffic between the Plan 
of Man and the areas beyond Pluto 
— the wastes that are called the 
Reefs of Space. Our secondary job 
is to monitor as much activity in 
the Reefs as possible. Our radar, 
laser and optical systems are the 
heart of our mission — and so. 
Cadet Gann, what you do is the 
most important part of our work 
here. Don’t fail us.” 

“Sir!” said Boysie Gann earnestly, 
“I won’t fail you! I serve the Plan 
of Man without question or pause!” 
And he saluted and left. 

But before he left he dropped 
his orders and retrieved them, with 
a flashing grin of apology to the 
colonel. 

He left with his shoulders high. 
For in' the instant when he wa» 
bent out of the commandant’s sight, 
picking up his papers, he had 
planted a listening bug under the 
projecting rim of Machine Colonel 
Zafar’s desk. 

W ithin an hour of Gann’s ar- 
rival on Polaris Station he 
was fitted with an iron collar. 

He had expected it. In so sensi- 
tive an installation as the station, 
every man wore one of the Ma- 
chine’s collars, so that at any in- 
stant, wherever he might be, any 
one of them could be destroyed. 
There was no other way. A space 
man gone amok — a traitor loose 
in the fuel stores — a drunken 
armorer at the studs of the station’s 
mighty missiles — any individual 
could do so much harm that it 
was necessary to have instant con- 
trol over every man aboard.

Still, k was an unoomfortaUe 
ieeling. Gann touched the collar 
fightly, and for once die smile was 
fone from his cheerful face. It was 
disturbing to know that someone 
somewhere — the distant Machine 
on Earth, or one of its satellites 
nearby; a security officer on Pluto, 
or the commandant here on the 
station — could at the surge of a 
radar pulse detonate the decapita- 
tion charge. 

His bunkmate was a tall, lean 
Nigerian, Technicadet M’Buna. 
Lounging in the security office, 
waiting for Gann, M’Buna saw his 
involuntary gesture and laughed. 
As he held the door and they 
started off to their duty post 
M’Bima said, “Makes you nervous, 
eh? Don’t worry. If it goes off, 
you’ll never know it!” 

Gann grinned. He liked M’Buna, 
had at first encounter already real- 
ized that here was an intelligent, 
mdent friend. Yet he said at once, 
■Nobody likes a collar. And — ” 
he acted a pause, gjancing around 
— “I hear there are people some- 
s(4iere who do something about it. 
Out on the Reefs. Men who know 
how to get the collars off . .” 

M’Buna said imcomfortably, “I 
wouldn’t know anything about that. 
Here’s our station.” 

Gann nodded and let it pass. 
But he had not failed to notice that 
M’Buna had overlooked one essen- 
tial act. What Gann said hinted at 
treason to the Plan. M’Buna’s 
duty was clear: He should have 
called Gann on it and established 
exactly what was meant by the hint. 
And then reported Gann at once. 



H uge as an ocean liner, flimsy 
as a dragon-kite, Polaris Sta- 
tion was a big plastic wheel. Its 
spin was just fast enough to keep 
the crew’s soup in the plate and 
the plate on the table. The hub 
was stationary, with the radar-laser 
search dome on the north face, the 
entry locks on the other. 

The station had been set up first, 
more than : quarter-century before, 
as a base for exploring the Reef 
cluster immediatdy to the galactic 
north of the sun. The snowball that 
had supplied reaction mass for the 
old nuclear rockets was still in de- 
tector range, swinging a hundred 
miles from the station in their 
coupled orbits. Now diere was no 
need for reaction mass, but the 
snow-asteroid still had its uses. It 
served as a cosmic garbage dump, 
the unreclaimed wastes and offal of 
the station hauled out there after 
every watch and left on its surface 
so that free-orbiting particles oi 
trash woi not return false signals 
to the search instruments back at 
the station. 

Within forty-eight hours of re- 
porting aboard the station. Machine 
Major Boysie Gann had bugged 
the offices of the commandant, the 
executive officer, the quartermas- 
ter and the intelligence chief. Each 
tiny instrument was broadcasting a 
sealed-wave pickup of every word 
that was uttered in those sacrosanct 
chambers. Gann himself spot-moni- 
tored the transmissions when time 
allowed. The rest of the time the 
great records machine on Pluto re- 
ceived the signals, taped them and 
transmitted them to Earth and die

Imried citadel of the Planning Ma- 
chine itself. 

But all his bugs produced noth- 

tag- 

Gann’s orders had been less than 
explicit: Seek out and identify en- 
emies of the Plan. Beyond that 
there had been only rumors. A vast 
smuggling enterprise, shipping val- 
uable strategic materials from the 
inner Plan Worlds to the Reefs. A 
strange new cult that threatened to 
unite the reefs against the inner 
planets. A leader preaching a 
hegira. A security leak . But 
which of these was true, if any, 
Gann had not been told. It was 
not security doctrine to tell agents 
precisely what they should be look- 
ing for, on the grounds that their 
time was most productively em- 
ployed when they could develop 
and follow up on many of their 
own leads. 

Yet here there were no leads at 

an. 

No real leads, at least. A few 
unguarded remarks at mess. Some 
slipshod accounting of spare parts 
for the laser banks. These were 
anti-Plan irregularities, to be sure, 
and men had gone to the Body 
Bank for far less. Men would go 
to the Body Bank for them now, 
from Polaris Station, for Gann had 
promptly filed the names and data. 
But he was i^ertain that what he 
should be looking for was some- 
thing* bigger and worse than an oc- 
casional disgruntled or sloppy of- 
ficer. 

Within one week Gann had 
proved to his own satisfaction that 
if there was any major anti-Plan 



activity going on, it was not om 
Polaris Station. 

He had to look elsewhere. 

But where else was there? 

... It wasn’t until he had been 
there twice that he realized where 
the ‘‘elsewhere” had to be. 

L ike all the noncommissioned 
personnel, Gann took his share 
of KP, garbage detail, cleanup or- 
derly and so on. It was not usually 
a burdensome chore. The radar 
ovens and cybernated housekeepers 
did all the work; the only thing 
left for the men in charge was to 
make sure they were working prop- 
erly. Even the short hop from sta- 
tion to the snowball for garbage 
disposal was a welcome break in 
the routine. 

He shared his garbage tour with 
M’Buna, and they spent their time 
chatting desultorily at the controls 
of the “scow” — actually a reaction- 
less space-tractor — while the gar- 
bage pods steered, unloaded and 
returned themselves. M’Buna had 
never referred to Gann’s leading 
remark about collars. Nor had 
Gann ever been able to draw him 
into any unplanned talk; he had 
given up trying. They talked about 
home. They talked about promo- 
tion. And they talked about girls. 

For Gann there was one girl, and 
her name was Julie Martinet. “No 
bigger than a minute, M’Buna,” he 
said earnestly, “and with those 
beautiful dark eyes. She’s waiting 
for me. When I come back — ” 
“Sure,” said M’Buna. “Now, this 
girl I knew in Lagos — ” 

“You’re talking about a girl,” 



STARCHILO

said Gann. “Julie is the girl. The 
only one who matters.” 

“How come you never get any 
mail from her?” asked M’Buna. 

And Gann froze. 

“She doesn’t like to write letters,” 
he said after a moment, but inside 
he was cursing himself. So foolish 
a slip! There was a reason, and a 
perfectly good one, why he got no 
letters from JuHe Martinet. They 
were piling up for him on Pluto, 
he was sure of diat; but they could 
not be forwarded here. There was 
too much risk of someone reading 
one, and learning from some chance 
comment that Gann was not the 
simple laser tech he appeared. 

As soon as he could Gann 
changed the subject. “Say,” he said, 
“what’s that on the scope?” It was 
a tiny blip, settling down feather- 
light toward the surface of the 
snowball protoplanet. A clutter of 
trash, of course. Nothing more. It 
was by no means unusual for some 
part oi the garbage cargo to re- 
bound from the tenuous clutch of 
the snowball’s gravity and whed 
around in space for minutes or 
hours before finally settling into 
place. 

But M’Buna glanced at the radar 
display and said casually: “The 

commandant, I suppose. He comes 
out here every once in a while to 
dieck things over.” 

Carefully, trying to hide his ex- 
citement, Gann said, “Wonder what 
he does there.” M’Buna shrugged, 
reached forward and turned a 
switch. The pod had emptied itself 
and returned to the ship. “Tell you 
what,” Gann went on. “Let’s look.” 



H e didn’t wait for an answer. 

The pod back, the scow ready, 
there was nothing to stop him. He 
fed the ion-stream to the reaction- 
less drive and cut in the course 
correcting side-rockets. The scow 
began to move. 

M’Buna said tautly, “No! Cut k 
out, Gann. The Old Man isn’t going 
to want us skylarking around with- 
out permission.” 

But Gann wasn’t listening. He 
was watching the screens intently. 

If Machine Colonel Z^far was 
paying surreptitious visits to the 
ice-planetoid there had to be a rea- 
son. He was going to find out what 
that reason was. He cut in maxi- 
mum magnification on the screens, 
and the surface of the little proto- 
planet of frozen gases leap^ up 
toward him. 

The thing was eight or ten miles 
thick, shaped more like a broken 
cinder block than a sphere. It was 
unusually dense, as the distant, orbit- 
ing blobs of frozen methane and 
hydrogen went; if it ever drifted 
in near the sun, it would make a 
major comet. In the screen its 
greenish crust of solid gases looked 
like a blizzard in slow motion. Dis- 
turbed by the impact of the waste 
they had dumped, the whole snow- 
ball was quivering and shaking, its 
light gas-snow . rising in sheets and 
falling again. 

There was absolutely nothing to 
be seen . 

But even a tiny planetoid has a 
great deal of surface by human 
standards. Somewhere on that sur- 
face Colonel Zafar had gone in his 
flying suit. Gann reached again for

Some noise warned him. 

He turned, and saw M’Buna 
leaning toward him, a strange ex- 
pression of mingled pity and hate 
on his face; and in M’Buna’s hand 
was a glittering metal pencil, point- 
ed at him. 

In that split-second of time that 
was left to him Gann thought 
wildly: If only I could get the re- 
port in, Fve sure found something 
anti-Plan going on now . 

And that was the last thought 
he had for a long time. He heard 
a hiss and had just time to realize 
that the sting on his cheek was a 
nerve-pellet fired from M’Buna's 
contraband gun. That was all. 
Blackness closed over him, and 
cold. 

Ill 

A nerve pellet is an instant anes- 
thetic. It is also something 
more. 

It does not wear off. Not ever. 
The victim of a nerve pellet does 
not recover consciousness until he 
is given an antidote. 

When Gann woke up, he had no 
idea of how long he had been un- 
der the influence of the nerve 
pellet. But what he knew for sure 
was that he was no longer in the 
control room of the garbage scow. 

Nor was he anywhere else in 
the universe where he had ever 
been before. 

He lay on an uneven, rocky 
ledge. Under him was a soft, moist 
— and warm! — blanket of some- 
thing that seemed to be a lichen. 



a kind of clinging moss that grew 
in thick, flaky scales. 

It was glowing with a soft steady 
light. On the rocks around him the 
light was greenish in hue. Farther 
away, on higher ridges, it shone 
purple and red. 

And above the rocks the sky was 
velvet black, with a single dazzling 
star blazing down on him. 

Boysie Gann struggled to his 
feet — and soared into the air. 

As he came down he stared 
about him. When he looked away 
from the rocks and that bright star 
his eyes adjusted and he could see 
other stars. All the familiar con- 
stellations . And then it hit him. 

That bright star was the sun. 

He was on one of the Reefs of 
Space. 

G ann nevCT knew how he came 
there. The man vfbo would 
sorely know was KTBuna, and 
Gann never saw M*Buna again. 
But h was dear that while under 
the influence of the narft pellet he 
had been transported and maroon- 
ed. Alone, withoid a radio, without 
instruments, without a riiip or 
spacesuit, he might five out his life 
on that Reef — but he would die 
there in the end. For he could nev- 
er leave. 

It was surely a good way to dis- 
pose of an unwanted man — sim- 
pler even than murder, since there 
was no body to get rid of. 

He was stiff and cold. His wrists 
were swollen and his ankles numb. 
Evidently his captors had not trust- 
ed to the nerve pellet to keep him 
quiet, but had riiackled lam as well.

But the shackles were gone now, 
with every other evidence of who k 
was who had brought him here. His 
head hurt. He was parched and 
hungry. 

He began to k)ok around him 
more methodically. 

His first needs were food and 
water; but he could not resist a 
look around at the wonder of the 
place. Bright metallic fern fronds 
tinkled like wind-gongs from an 
overgrown vale to one side. A dis- 
tant whirring soimded like a flock 
of grouse. Impossible that there 
should be grouse here, Gann knew; 
yet there might be some sort of 
life. The Reefs of Space were 
created by life, like the coral atolls 
on Earth’s warm seas. Life inhabit- 
ed them all. 

But it was not always — not 
even often! — life of a sort com- 
patible with humankind. For the 
Reefs were formed from clusters of 
fusorians, feasting on the hydrogen 
formed between the stars according 
to the laws of the Neo-Hoyle Hy- 
pothesis, coverting it into heavier 
atoms, and then into atoms heavier 
still. The life in the Reefs was 
sometimes warm-blooded, carbon- 
based, oxygen-breathing animal. 
But more often it was metal or 
crystal — at best, worthless for 
food; at worst, a deadly danger. 

The bright star, Sol, was near 
the south celestial pole, Gann dis- 
covered. That put him more or less 
galactic north of the sun — and 
therefore, almost straight out from 
Polaris Station. How far out? He 
had no way of knowing, except 
tfiat the major Reef clusters were 



thought to be some two hundred 
astronomical units from Sol. At a 
guess, twenty billion miles. 

Gann turned his eyes from the 
stars and looked about him. He had 
a world to explore. It might be less 
than a hundred yards in its longest 
axis, but it was all he had. 

He rubbed his aching wrists and 
ankles and began to explore. He 
climbed carefully out of that small, 
glowing green dell — carefully, be- 
cause he knew the daftger of a 
reeflet. The fusorian symbiotes held 
an atmosphere, somehow; but it 
was like a soap bubble, and if Gann 
were so incautious as to step too 
high and soar through it, he would 
find himself in the hard vacuum 
of the space between the stars, and 
death would come in a horrible ex- 
plosive burst as his blood boiled 
off and his cells ruptured. 

He climbed toward the ridge 
paused and looked around. 

Ahead of him was another dell 
this one bearing some sort of glit- 
tering bush. The t^ants were shoul- 
der-high, with plumes of narrow 
gloss, sprinkled with what seemed 
to be individual fusorian cells that 
glowed with their own light. Each 
leaf darkened from green at the 
base to black at the tip, and each 
ended in a bright red berry. 

Queerly, they grew in rows. 

They looked, in fact, like a truck 
farm in Earth’s populous market 
valleys, and at once Gann’s hunger 
surged forth. They looked like 
food! He started toward them at a 
shambling run — 

And from behind him a voice 
^oke.

“Well, good for you. See you 
woke up finally. Headed right for 
the feedbag too, eh?” 

M achine Major Boysie Gann’s 
training had prepared him 
for any shock. It was trained reflex 
that stopped him in mid-flig’;u, 
turned him, brought him hick 
down to the glowing mossy si u race 
of the reeflet in a half criiich, 
ready to do battle. 

But there was nothing wc'iike in 
the figure that was coming toward 
him. 

He was a stubby little man with 
a big belly and a dirty yellow 
beard. His clothing was woven out 
of some kind of rough fiber. It was 
ragged and filthy and half unbut- 
toned. 

And clinging to his bald brown 
head was a black-fanged, green- 
scaled, red-eyed creature the size of 
a capuchin monkey. It looked like 
a toy dragon. And from under the 
knife-sharp edges of its scales 
seeped little wisps of smoke. 

Boysie Gann said warily: “Hello.” 
“Why, hello,” the man said in a 
mild voice, “^u was sleeping. Fig- 
ured rd best leave you to sleep it 
off. Nice to have you here. I wasn^t 
expecting company.” 

“I wasn’t exactly expecting to be 
here.” 

The man nodded and thrust out 
a dirty, gnarled hand. “Figured 
that. Couple fellows dropped you 
five, six hours ago. Looks like they 
gave you a rough enough time so I 
let you be.” 

The creature on its head wheeled 
to face Gann as its owner moved, 



glaring at him with hot red eyes, 
Gann shook the man’s hand and 
said, “I need some water. And 
food.” 

“Why, sure. Come along then.” 
He nodded, the creature scram- 
bling back and forth, and turned 
to lead the way across the culti- 
vated field toward what seemed to 
be a tiny black lake. “Omer don’t 
like strangers,” he called over his 
shoulder, “but he won’t bother you 
none. Just don’t make any sudden 
moves, is all. Omer’s a pyropod — 
just a baby, of course, but they can 
be mean.” 

Silently Gann agreed. The littio 
creature looked mean enough, with 
its oozing plumes of smoke and 
fiery eyes. They loped across the 
glowing rows of the man’s little 
farm and reached the shore of the 
lake — no more than a pond^ 
really, fifty feet across, its surface 
disturbed with the slow, tall waves 
of low-gravity fluids. On its far 
bank a sharp cliff rose in a glitter 
of metallic outcroppings, softened 
by glowing plants and mosses, and 
in the base of the cliff was a metSi 
lean-to that hid the mouth of the 
cave. “That’s home,” said the man 
cheerfully. “Welcome to it, such as 
’tis. Come in and rest yourself.” 

“Thanks,” said Gann. “By the 
way, we didn’t really introduce our- 
selves.” 

“Oh? Guess you’re right,” said the 
man. “I’m Harry Hickson. And 
you — ” Gann started to speak, but 
Hickson didn’t pause — “you’re 
what you call it. Machine Major 
Boysie Gann, out of the spy school 
on Pluto.”

IF 




F or twenty-four hours Gann 
rested in the cave of the her- 
mit, Harry Hickson, and his 
thoughts were dark. 

How had Hickson known his 
name? Even more — how had he 
known that he was not a shang- 
haied radar-laser tech, but a gradu- 
ate of the spy school? 

There was no answer in Gann’s 
brain, so he shut off his mind to 
conjectures and applied it to restor- 
ing his physical condition and rec- 
onnoitering his surroundings. 

Evidently he had been uncon- 
scious for longer than he had 
thought on the ship that had 
dumped him on this reeflet, for he 
had lost weight and strength and 
there was a straggly stubble of 
beard on his chin. But Hickson fed 
him and cared for him. He gave 
Gann a bed of sorts to sleep on 
— only a stack of reeking blankets, 
but as good as the one he slept on 
himself — and fed him from the 
same pot of greasy stew as him- 
self. The diet was crude but filling, 
supplemented with fruits and roots 
and shoots of the plants he grew 
on the rock. The reddish berries, 
which tasted like a sort of acid 
citrous fruit, were a good source 
of all necessary vitamins, Harry 
told him earnestly, and one of the 
Hchens was a source of protein. 

Gann did not question the food. 
Clearly it had kept Harry Hickson 
alive for a long time — the cave 
showed that it had been his home 
for months or even years — and 
it would keep Gann alive for at 
least as long as he intended to stay 
on the reeflet. 



And that would not be long. For 
he had learned from Hickson that 
there was a way of communicating 
that would bring help if he needed 
it. “Never needed it, o’ course,” he 
said, fishing a long string of a rhu- 
barb-like vegetable out of his bowl 
of stew and licking his fingers. “But 
it’s comforting to know it’s there 
. Say, you worried about that 
collar, Boysie?” 

Gann stopped in mid-gesture, 
suddenly aware that he had been 
tugging at it. “Not exacdy,” he said 
quietly. 

“Get it off (rf you, if you like,” 
Hickson offered mBcfly. “No trou- 
ble. Done it lots o^ times.” 

Gann stared. “What the Plan arc 
you talking about?” he demanded. 
“Don’t you know what this is? 
These things are built with auto- 
matic destruct circuits, as well as 
the remote triggering equipment. If 
anybody tries to take them off — “ 
He touched both sides of the collar 
with fingertips and flipped them up 
and outward, pantomiming the ex- 
plosion of a decapitation charge. 

“Oh, sure, I know all about that,^ 
said Hickson. “Hold still. No, not 
you, Gann. You, Omer! Don’t 
wiggle so. Makes me nervous. 

He got up from his squatting 
position at the rude plank table 
where they ate and came around 
behind Gann. “Just you sit there, 
Boysie,” he said. “Can move if you 
want to, it don’t matter, but don’t 
look toward me . Omer con- 
found you! Get your claws outa my 
scalp! Raised hdm from an egg, 
that little devil, right here in my 
own smoke-pot, but he gets jumpy 



STARCmiD

when he knows I’m going to — 
Well, here we are.” 

And something moved around 
Gann’s neck. He couldn’t see what 
Hickson was doing, was sure that 
the tubby little hermit had not 
brought any tools or instruments. 
Yet there was a sudden constric- 
tion at his throat. 

He heard the lock snap. 

The collar fell of his neck and 
clattered to the floor of the cave. 
Gann leaped to his feet and 
spun, white-faced, to be ready for 
the explosion. But no explosion 
came. 

‘‘Now, rest easy, Boysie,” com- 
plained the hermit. “You’re spooking 
Omer, here. That thing can’t blow 
up any more.” Casually he picked 
up the collar and lifted it to ex- 
amine it in the light of a mass of 
luminous diamond that would have 
been worth millions on earth. 
“They make them real nice,” he 
said admiringly. “Lot of detail in 
this thing. Too bad it can’t be 
something more useful — ” And he 
tossed it to the rear of the cave. 
“Well,” he said, “you about ready 
to move on now?” 

Gann stood silent for a second, 
looking at him. “Move on where?” 
he asked. 

“Oh, don’t worry, Boysie. I know 
what you were thinking. Plain as 
day. You figure I ought to go back 
and get examined by the Planning 
Machine, ’cause you don’t quite un- 
derstand what I’m up to but you 
think it’s unplanned. Well, that’s 
right. Unplanned is what I am. 
And I don’t mind if you do what 
you’re thinking, and t^e my laser- 



gun and call help so you can get 
out of here. But I’m not going with 
you, Boysie. Make up your mind 
to that.” 

“All right,” said Gann, surrender- 
ing. But in his mind he was not 
surrendering at all. 

Hickson had put it very mildly 
when he said that Gann wanted to 
take him back for study. Gann not 
only wanted to, he intended to. In 
fact, he had never intended any- 
thing as hard in his life — had 
never been so determined or insist- 
ent, not even about his career in 
the service of the Machine, not 
even in his great love for Julie Mar- 
tinet. 

This man Harry Hickson was an 
unplanned disaster in the making. 

Whoever he was, however he did 
what he did, he was a terrible dan- 
ger to the Plan of Man. Gann 
could almost hear the instructions 
of his briefing officer back on 
Pluto — if he had been able to re- 
port Hickson’s existence to him, 
and if the briefing officer could 
issue an order: Subject Hickson is 
a negative factor. His uncatalogued 
knowledge must be retrieved for 
the Plan. Then each organ of his 
unautomated body must be ob~ 
Uterated . 

But how to get him back into 
the jurisdiction of the Planning 
Machine? 

There had to be a way. 

There would be a way. Machine 
Major Boysie Gann was sure of it. 
An it required was that he be pa- 
tient — and then, when his chance 
came, be ready. 

Gann said, “If you mean it, then 

IF 



24 




let’s take your guo and signal right 
now. I’m ready to move on.” 

H arry Hickson led Gann to a 
point of red-scaled rock, puff- 
ing and wheezing. On his bald scalp 
the fledgling pyropod wheeled and 
slithered, keeping its bright red 
eyes on Boysie Gann. 

'‘See up there?” called Hickson 
over his Moulder. “That star there 
next to Vega — ” 

Boysie Gann followed his point- 
ing finger. “You mean Theta 
Lyrae?” 

The hermit turned and looked at 
him, mildly surprised. “That’s right, 
Boysie. You fellows learn a lot in 
that spy school. Too bad you don’t 
— Well, never mind that. One I 
mean, it’s just below. Theta Lyrae. 
The faint red one. Forget the 
name, but that one right there. 
That way’s Freehaven.” 

Gann felt his blood pound. 
“Freehaven? I’ve heard of it. A 
colony of reef-rats.” 

“Aw, Boysie don’t say it like that. 
They’re free men, that’s all. That’s 
the biggest place in the Reefs, Free- 
haven is. Like a — well, what 
would you call it? A kind of a 
town only its one whole cluster of 
Reefs, maybe a hundred thousand 
miles across. And maybe half a bil- 
lion miles from here.” 

“I see,” said Gann, thinking with 
exultation and pride: What a prize 
to bring back to Pluto! A whole 
city to be Planned and returned to 
the brotherhood of the Machine! 
He could almost see the glowing 
jet-trails of the Plan cruisers vec- 
toring in on the cluster . 



“Don’t get your hopes up,” Hick- 
son said dryly. “You ain’t there yet, 
Boysie, and maybe even when you 
get there you won’t find it too easy 
to pick up a phone and call the 
Machine. Now hush a minute while 
I send for your ride out there.” 

He pick^ up the clumsy old 
laser gun he had taken out of its 
greasy rag wrappings • back in the 
cave, checked its power settings, 
raised it and aimed carefully at the 
distant red spark that was the line- 
of-sight to Freehaven. Three times 
he snapped the trigger, then lower- 
ed the gun and turned to Gann. 

“That’s all there is to it. Take 
’em a while to get here. Might as 
well go back to the cave.” 

But he paused, glancing at Boy- 
sie Gann as though he were mildly 
embarrassed about something. Then 
he seemed to come to a decision. 

He turned back to the stars, set 
down the laser pistol and stretched 
out his arms. His lips moved, but 
Gann could hear no sound. On his 
bald pate the pyropod hissed and 
slithered. The hermit’s whole body 
seemed stretched, yearning, to- 
ward — toward what? 

Gann could not tdl. Toward 
Freehaven, perhaps. Toward the 
faint red star that marked its posi- 
tion — or toward Theta Lyrae 
nearby — or toward the great 
bright giants of the Summer Tri- 
angle that marked that part of the 
sky, Vega, Altair and Deneb. 

Then Harry Hickson relaxed and 
the pyropod scuttled down from his 
scalp onto his shoulder, as the her- 
mit raised one arm and made a 
sinuous, undulating motion. Like ^

Ihe wriggle of a snake, Gann 
tibought Or the looping movement 
•f a swan’s neck. 

Swan? Some faint old memory 
•tirred in Boysie Gann’s mind. 
Something about a swan — and a 
•tar — 

But it would not come clear, and 
lie followed Hairy Hickson back to 
the cave. 

H arry Hickson’s little reeflet 
was one drifting island in an 
expanding infinity of matter and 
space. The doctrine of the Neo- 
Hoyle Hypothesis was clear: The 
universe was limitless, in space, in 
time — and in matter. New mass 
was forming everywhere in the 
form of newly created hydrogen 
atoms, as the old complexes of 
matter — the stars and planets, the 
dust clouds and the galaxies — 
were spinning slowly apart. 

Hickson’s reeflet was an infant 
among bodies of organized matter, 
probably only a few millions of 
years in age, in size no more than 
a dust mote. Yet it was like most 
of the universe in that; for most 
matter is young. The spiralling 
growth in rate of creation of new 
matter makes that sure. Some gal- 
axies, and even some of the reefs 
between them, are old beyond com- 
putation and imagination, because 
the steady-state universe has nei- 
ther beginning nor end. And life is 
the oldest phenomenon of all. Older 
than the oldest stars — but yet 
young, though those scattered and 
forgotten stars are black and dead. 

Life in space has lived — literaL 
ly — forever. 



Every p o;e ii i.> oecn 

evolved, through every conceivable 
evolutionary test. 

Watching Harry Hickson play 
with his pet pyropod, Boysie Gann 
reflected that the strangest life- 
form he knew was man. For here 
was the pudgy, balding hermit — 
unplanned and deviant, a deadly 
danger by every standard of the 
Planning Machine — solemnly at- 
tempting to teach his pyropod to 
fly. 

He lifted the little horror off his 
head and set it carefully on a high 
ledge, then retreated. Spitting and 
hissing, its red eyes glittering, its 
scales seeping the smoke of its in- 
ternal jet fires, it wailed in a thin, 
raucous screech for him to come 
back. Then, despairing, it launched 
itself out into the air, missed Hick- 
son by yards and crashed into the 
rock w^ at the far side of. the 
cave, where it remained, writhing 
and hissing, until Hickson took pity 
on it and picked k up. “It’s a won- 
der it doesn’t dash its brains out,” 
muttered Gann, die fifth time the 
little beast crashed into the rock. 

“Oh, I guess so,” Hickson agreed 
mildly. “Don’t suppose it has any, 
really, diough- A pretty clumsy 
kind of beast k is, right, Omer?” 
And he patted the little monster 
with the appearance of real affec- 
tion for a moment, then sighed and 
set it down. He carefully inverted 
a crate and set it down over the 
pyropod, then put a mass of silvery 
fusorian coral upon the crate. 

The pyropod squalled and hissed 
but Hickson ignored it. “Hoped I 
could teach it to fly before I go,” 



26 



rr* 




he said regretfully, ‘‘but I guess I 
won’t make it. Boysie, your trans- 
portation ought to be here in an 
hour. Care to see what the pilot’s 
gonna look like?” He thumbed an 
old-fashioned two-dimensional color 
print out of a button-down pocket 
in his ragged coat and handed it to 
Gann. It was a pretty, quite young 
girl, one hand resting on the head 
of a seal-like creature, before a 
background of a glowing purple 
and silver Reef. “Name’s Quarla,” 
said the old man affectionately. 
“Quarla Snow. Daughter of an old 
friend of mine. He treated me, 
couple years ago. Doctor, he is, 
and a good one. Don’t know much 
about what ails me, though. .” 

The hermit seemed to realize he 
was rambling and caught himself 
wp short, “Guess that’s all,” he said, 
smiling with a touch of embarrass- 
ment. “Swan bless you, Boysie. 
Give Quarla my love.” And in a 
moment, before Gann could real- 
ize what he was about to do, the 
old man had turned, pushed aside 
the metal door that overhung the 
entrance to the cave, and stepped 
out. 

Gann shook his head, half in rue- 
ful amusement, half in surprise. 
“Hey!” he called. “Hickson! Where 
are you going? Wait for me!” And 
he hurried to the door of the cave 
and out onto the sward the old 
hermit had so carefully cropped. 

The man was not there. 

His footprints were there, still 
visible in the faint bruises on the 
lichenous surface of the earth. 

But Harry Hickson was gone. 

Gann ranged the surface of the 



entire reef in the next few hours, 
shouting and searching. But there 
was no answer to his call, no sight 
of Hickson anywhere. 

The man had simply vanished. 

IV 

I n the cave 'Machine Major 
Gann found the old man’s 
laser gun — an ancient Technicorps 
model that must have been smug- 
gled into space before the Space- 
wall was set up. It gave him 
a small feeling of confidence to 
carry it, though there was no visi- 
ble enemy to shoot it at. 

He needed that confidence. 

No man can be alone- Each man 
has his place in the Plan of Man, 
under the benevolent guidance of 
the Planning Machine. Each man 
serves the Plan, so that the Plan 
may serve all men. 

That was doctrine, and Boysie 
Gann found himself foolishly re- 
peating it as he clambered up the 
red-scaled rock to the point from 
which Hickson had signaled to 
Freehaven. It did not help very 
much. 

No man can be alone . but 
Boysie Gann felt very much alone 
indeed, on that tiny floating islet 
of reef, under the blazing stare of 
a billion stars. 

There was no reason for him to 
be on this point of rock, rather 
than anywhere else on the surface 
of the reeflet. He had no reason 
to believe his rescuer would come 
to look for him there. Had no rea- 
son to be sure there would be a 
rescuer at all, in fact, for what the 



STARCHILD 



27 




half-demented hermit, Harry Hick- 
son, had said could not be accepted 
as reliable . Yet he stayed there, 
waiting, for hours. He leaned 
against a cairn of rock and scanned 
the skies. Only the distant, un- 
friendly stars returned his look. He 
sat, leaning against the rock, and 
drowsed. No sound or motion dis- 
turbed him. And then. 

There was a faint blur of green- 
ish mist in the low black sky, mov- 
ing at the threshold of vision. 

Gann sprang to his feet, eyes 
peering into the immense emptiness 
above him. The greenish blur was 
so faint he could not be sure it 
was real. Yet — surely there was 
something there; and, following it, 
a cluster of even fainter reddish 
sparks. 

Gann raised the laser, checked 
the settings to make sure he was 
not firing a blast of destruction in- 
to the sky, and thumbed the trigger 
thrice, as he had seen Hickson do, 
pointing it toward the greenish blur. 

A moment . and then the green 
glow veered toward him. 

It was his rescuer, he was sure 
of it. But what were the red 
sparks? Even as he watched, the 
tiny, distant coals veered too, fol- 
lowing the greenish glow. Rapidly 
they grew nearer . 

Then one of the red sparks 
dashed ahead of the rest, with a 
long blue trail of incandescence 
faintly visible behind it. It was like 
an ominous comet as it dived 
through the greenish cloud. 

Noise smote Gann’s ears abrupt- 
ly: a sudden roaring, like the jet 
of an old-time rocket. 

M 



The things had come at last into 
the shallow atmosphere of his reef- 
let. He heard the shriek of their 
motion through the air — and 
something else. 

Something was screaming. 

The red spark thundered over- 
head, out of the green cloud, to- 
ward Gann like some deadly an- 
cient missile homing in on a radar 
trace — then at the last moment 
rose up a dozen yards above his 
head, and as it passed he caught a 
sudden glimpse of nightmare. 

Metal scales fike broken mirrors. 
Enormous tdons, dripping some- 
thing that glowed and was golden, 
something that splattered to the 
ground near Gann like a soft, fitful 
rain. The red spark divided into 
two red, monstrous, blinking eyes, 
mirror-rimmed, in a head like a 
maniac dragon’s. And the roaring 
blue flame was the tail of the thing. 

‘‘Pyropod!” breathed Boysie Gam? 
aloud, transfixed. 

He had never seen an adult 
before — had heard of them 
only as distant rumors, like the 
sort of ghost stories unplanned par- 
ents used to tell their children. 
The baby pyropod that had been 
Harry Hickson’s pet had not pre- 
pared him for the huge, menacing 
reality that shrieked through the 
air above him now. He stood, 
stunned. 

A pyropod is a living rocket, 
flame-footed and deadly. Their 
chemistry is not that of Earthly 
air-brcjithers; their primeval genesis 
came from the same non-carbon 
evolutionary strain that shaped the 

IF 




[fusorians. On their plasma jets, 
jaticlear in temperature, fired by 
[fusorian symbiotes, they can out- 
:fun a Plan cruiser and outfight any 
Terrestrial beast in search of prey. 
And to the pyropods, anything that 
moves is prey. Their jets take enor- 
;mous quantities of reaction mass. 
Their appetites are insatiable. Scav- 
engers of space, they will attack 
anything. 

Fortunately for the continuation 
of life on the inner planets and the 
Reefs of Space, atmosphere is a 
slow poison to the pyropods and 
gravity damages their reflexes. 
They are beasts of the interstellar 
void, ship-sized monstrosities at 
their hugest, big as cave bears even 
when barely mature. Standing in 
shock, watching the great beast 
Boysie Gann stared at the red eyes 
pulsing in their telescopic mirrors, 
wheel and flash back toward him, 
imagined the black talons ripping 
metal or rock like bread . 

And realized, almost too late, 
that he was the target of those 
monstrous talons now. 

Instinctively he raised the laser 
gun and fired. 

The charge was minimal, only 
the message setting; yet the great 
pyropod felt it, screamed and soar- 
ed away. Gann hurled himself to 
the shelter of the rock cairn, star- 
ing about. The torn green cloud 
of luminosity was dissolving in the 
night sky above him. Streamers of 
mist scattered and faded. And 
where the cloud had been, Gann 
could see what had brought it. 

A spaceling. One of the warm- 
blooded, seal-like creatures that 



roam the space between the stars, 
natural prey to the pyropods, friend 
to man. It had brought the cloud 
— for it was the spaceling’s ability 
to hold atmosphere about it, in a 
Ryeland-effect field, that per- 
mitted them, as oxygen-breathers, 
to live in space at all. 

The spaceling had been grievous- 
ly wounded. Even from so far 
away, Gann could see the hideous 
slash that ripped along the whole 
length of its sleek, golden body as 
it came tumbling down. Something 
was clinging to its fur — a rider? 
Gann could not be sure; but what 
he was certain of was that the end 
for both the spaceling and its 
burden was very near. 

The pyropod that had attacked 
him had wheeled again and was 
diving on the wounded seal-like 
beast. 

A louder howling drowned out 
the spaceling’s scream as the pyro- 
pod came out of the dark over a 
purple-scaled ridge, red eyes pulsing 
and dripping talons reaching again. 

Gann reacted without thought. 
He twisted the crystal of that old 
laser to maximal intensity, steadied 
the tube on the rocks of the cairn 
and fired into those dreadful flash- 
ing eyes. They exploded. 

The pyropod bellowed in agony. 
Its eyes were gone — eyes or eye- 
like structures; actually, Gann 
knew, they were more like laser 
search gear. But whatever they 
were, they were gone now, burst 
like the shattered hull of a subtrain 
when the field of its tunnel fails 
and the fluid rock crushes it. The 
pyropod drove blindly up and 



STARCHILD

away, squalling until its sound was 
cut off like tibe dropping of a cur- 
tain. 

It had passed beyond the atmos- 
phere into space. Blind and wound- 
ed, Gann thought it would not be 
back. And a blessing that was, since 
an orange light was blinking on 
the laser gun, warning him that 
the fuel cell was fully exhausted. 

He knew there were other pyro- 
pods still out there, somewhere be- 
yond the veil of air. He could see 
their faint red sparks circling, and 
the blue trails of their fiery ex- 

hausts. They veered all at once, 
and drove in toward the retreating 
comet-tail of the pyropod he had 
wounded. There was a puff of in- 
candescent vapor . 

Dimly Gann realized that its 
mates had destroyed the wounded 
one, torn it open and were now 
wheeling and diving, fighting for 
their shares of the kill. But he had 
no time for them. The spaceling 
had tumbled to earth halfway 
across the little reeflet, and Gann 
stumbled and leaped across the red- 
scaled rocks to find it. 

I t was lying at the edge of 

Harry Hickson’s little planta- 
tion, ^urting glowing yellow blood 
across the green moss. Beside it 
was its rider, bent over the terrible 
wound, trying- with both hands to 
stanch the flow of blood. 

The rider was a girl. Hickson 
had been right. It was the girl in 
the photograph he had displayed. 

The spaceling moaned and shud- 

dered as Gann drew near, its voice 
a faint, inarticulate sob 



The girl was sobbing too. 

“Can I help?” said Boysie Gann. 

The girl, Quarla Snow, turned 
quickly, startled. She stared at 
Gann as though he were himself a 
pyropod, or some more fearsome 
monster from legend. There wa* 
fright in her eyes — and yet queer- 
ly, thought Gann, almost relief as 
well; as though she had expected 
something even worse. It was the 
expression of a man who finds him- 
self confronted by a wolf — when 
he expects a tiger. 

“Who are you?” she demanded. 
Her ' voice was low and controlled. 
She was tall and strong, but very 
young. 

“Boysie Gann,” he said. “And 
you’re Quarla Snow. Harry Hick- 
son told me you’d be here.” 

Her hand flew to her mouth. 
Her eyes widened in fear. For a 
moment she seemed about to run, 
then she shook her head in a 
pathetic gesture and turned ba^ to 
the spaceling. 

Its golden blood had ceased to 
flow, ks body to move. The sounds 
it had uttered were still. 

“Sultana’s dead,” the girl said 
softly, as though to herself. 

“Fm sorry,” Boysie Gann said in- 
adequately. He glanced aloft — tha 
pyropods were out of sight entirely 
now — then back to her. Quarla 
Snow’s face was lightly tanned, al- 
most to match her honeycolored 
hair. She was nearly the color of 
her spaceling. Her white coveralla 
were splashed with that golden 
ichor, her hands dripping with it 
Yet she was beautiful. 

For a moment a buried emotion

tmnbled inside Boysie Gann, a 
fflemory of Julie Martinet and the 
taste of the fresh salt surf on her 
mouth when he kissed her on the 
beach of the little Mexican resort. 
Playa Blanca, long ages ago when 
they had said good-by. This girl 
m not in the least resemble Julie 
Martinet. She was blonde where 
Julit had hair like night; she was 
tall, and Julie tiny. Her face was 
broad, friendly and, even in her 
sorrow and fear, it showed con- 
tentment and joy in life, while Julie 
Martinet was a girl ,of sad pleas- 
ures and half-expressed sorrows. 
Yet there was something in both 
of them that stirred him. 

He said hastily: “Those things 

may be back. We’d better do some- 
thing about it.” 

The girl’s tears were drying on 
her cheeks and her expression had 
become more calm. She looked 
down at the dead gun in Gann’s 
hands and half-smiled. “Not with 
that, Boysie Gann. It’s empty.” 

I “I know. We’d better get back 
to Hickson’s cave. He may have 
left other charges.” 

“Left them? But I diought you 
said he was here!” The shadow fell 
over her face again, her eyes bright 
and fearful. 

“He was, yes. But he’s gone. Dis- 
appeared. I don’t know where.” 

The girl nodded absently, as 
diough she were too dazed to take 
in what he had said. She dropped 
to her knees beside the dead space- 
fing and stroked ks golden head. 
“Poor Sultana. I’ll never forgive 
myself. When I got your signal I 
— well, I was frightened. I dida^ 



know what to do. Dad was gone 
on an emergency call. He’d taken 
our ship, and — I decided to ride 
Sultana out here by myself.” 

Her mouth set white for a mo- 
ment. “I didn’t really think of -any 
danger. There aren’t many pyro- 
pods in these clusters any more — 
been hunted out years ago, though 
they keep straying back. But I’d 
outrun them on Sultana often 
enough before. I didn’t think about 
the fact that she’s — that she was 
— getting old.” 

She stood up and touched Gann 
lightly on the arm, a gesture of 
reassurance. “But you’re not to 
worry. We aren’t marooned here; 
Dad win come for us in the ship 
as soon as he gets home. I left a 
message.” 

Gann nodded. “So he’ll wait a 
wMe,” he said, comprehendingly, 
“and then, if you haven’t returned 
in — what? a day or so? — then 
he’ll come looking for you.” 

But Quarla Snow rfiook her gold- 
en head, her expression unreadable. 
“No. He won’t wait. Not even a 
second. I said in my note that 
Harry Hickson’s old distress signal 
had come. He’D be here as fast as 
his ship can bring him, to see who 
sent Harry’s signaL” 

Gann stared. “Harry did. Harry 
Hickson. I told you!” 

“I know you told me,” the girt 
said, her voice calm but with an 
undercurrent of wonder and of 
fear. “But you see, it couldn’t have 
been Harry. I — no, wait. I’ll show 
you.” 

And she turned and led him 
away from the cultivated little field.

back up to the red-scaled crest of 
fock» where he bad rested hb laser 
gun on the cairn of rocks to fire 
at the pyropod. ‘"See?” she said, 
touching the cairn. 

He bent closer to look, and there 
on the lowermost rock, on one 
half-smoothed face of a boulder, 
was a faint scratching of carved 
letters, whittled out a line at a 
time with a laser gun, almost in- 
visible unless you knew just where 
to look:

“You see?” said the girl. “Harry

He died here three years ago.” 

V 

A ll this was months before the 
Writ of Liberation. On Earth 
the old Planner sat in silent, joyous 
communion with the Planning Ma- 
chine. In solarian space the great 
Plan cruisers arrowed from satellite 
to planet, from asteroid to distant 
Spacewall post, carrying the weap- 
ons and the orders of the Machine 
to all the farfJung territories of the 
Plan of Man. On the island of 
Cuba, in the Body Bank, a Niger- 
ian ex-Technicorps man, broken 
for inefficiency, gave up the last 
of his vital organs to serve some 
more worthy servant of the Plan, 
and died. (His name had once been 
M’Buna. He had been captured and 
court-martialed for desertion.) A 
girl named Julie Martinet, in a 



dormitory hall far below the sur- 
face of the Peruvian Andes, sat 
with stylus in hand deciding on 
which letter to write — one to the 
man she loved “but had not heard 
from”, the other an application for 
special duty in the service of the 
Machine. And out on the reefs, tn 
the sprawling hundred-orbed com- 
munity called Frcehaven, Machine 
Major Boysie Gann began to un- 
derstand that his greatest opportu- 
nity for service — and his greatest 
hope of reward! — had been hand- 
ed to him on a silver platter. 

For he was at large in Free- 
haven, the very heart of the Reefs 
of Space. And he knew, or thought 
he knew, a way to get back to th# 
worlds of the Plan. 

True, there were some puzzling 
problems. Some of them, indeed, 
were almost frightening. 

What could Quarla Snow hope 
to gain by pretending that Harry 
Hickson was dead? What did she 
think Gann had seen on the little 
reeflet? A ghost? 

It was no ghost that had fed 
him, healed him, taken the collar 
from around his neck. 

And it was no coincidence, he 
was coming to believe, that had 
brought him to Hickson’s world in 
the first place. 

There was no proof, of course. 
But he was sure that M’Buna, per- 
haps Colonel Zafar as well, were 
in some way related to Hickson 
and the treasonable activities that 
were going on all around him in 
this unplanned, decadent, danger- 
ous world of the Reefs. He had

a look, a renud!k ttoA was halted 
before It began. Nothing tangible 
— but enough to make him sure 
that there were links between the 
Reefs and the Plan worlds — links 
that extended even into the Tech- 
nicorps, even into the vital defenses 
of the Spacewall itself. 

If he could get back — No! he 
thought. When he got back, with 
the proof of this spreading rot, with 
the names of the conspirators and 
the evidence that would send them 
to the Body Bank, then no reward 
in the Machine’s power would be 
too great to give to Machine Major 
Boysie Gann. And Julie Martinet 
would be waiting. 

Meanwhile there was a lot of work 
to do. 

Gann dared not make notes or 
attempt to secure tapes or photo- 
graphs; but he missed no opportu- 
nity to scout and examine every 
part of this queer community of 
Freehaven. Even the name was 
strange and somehow disconcerting. 
Freehaven. 

As though “freedom” were im- 
portant! 

And yet — Boysie Gann could 
not help but notice that strangely 
the decadent, unruly mobs that 
dwelt in Freehaven seemed some- 
how sturdier, somehow happier, in 
some way more alert and even 
more prosperous than the billions 
who lived under the all-powerfid 
and protective embrace of the 
Plan of Man. 

It was confusing. 

But his duty was clear. Gann set 
himself to learn aM there was to 
know. 



F reehaven consisted of a o(Hipb 
of thousand people, scattered 
over a hundred fusorian-grown 
rocks and a hundred thousand 
miles of space. Many of the rocks 
had been terraformed, Gann learn- 
ed, with the lichenous air-plant he 
had first seen on Harry Hickson’s 
little reef. The rest of them were 
airless, but all of them supplied use- 
ful metals and minerals to the 
bustling economy of freehaven. 

Gann was not sure just what he 
had expected — tattooed savages, 
perhaps, dancing to a wild tomtom 
— but he had surely not been pre- 
pared for this modern, busy com- 
munity. There were farms and 
herds — of spacelings, but even in 
one case a stock farm with sixty 
head of what seemed to be Guern- 
sey cattle, stolen somehow from 
the Plan of Man and transported 
in some improbable manner out to 
this hydrogen-based worldlet twenty 
billion miles from the sun. On one 
airless reef that was mostly pure 
fusorian iron there was even a steel 
mill — one of the small nuclear- 
powered units developed by Tech- 
nicorps engineers for use on the 
asteroids, to save the high cost of 
lifting Terran steel into space. 
Gann marveled at it all. He ad- 
mitted it to Quarla Snow and her 
father, with whom he was staying 
as guest ... or prisoner, he was 
never siu*e which ... at a meal 
when he was served as fine a steak 
as he had ever tasted, with wines 
that hom the bouquet of French 
vineyards. 

Dt. Snow boomed: “It isn’t only 
ttm food that is good here, youi^

IF 




man. ft is life! It has a fiavor here 
that the Plan worlds wffl never 
taste.** 

Boysie Oann said engagingly, 
“You may be right. I — well, you 
have to excuse me. You see, I’ve 
never known anything but the 
Plan.” 

Quarla’s father nodded briskly. 
“Of course. None of us had, before 
we made our way out here. None 
but Quarla, at any rate, and a few 
others like her who were bom here. 
They’ve lived in freedom all their 
lives.” 

Gann said, with just the right in- 
flexion of doubt: “But I don’t un- 
derstand. I mean — how does it 
work? Who tells you what you’re 
to do?” 

“No one, boy! ITiat’s the whole 
point of freedom! We came here 
because we didn^ want to five un- 
der the collar of the Machine. We 
work together, and as you see we 
work welL I^sperity and happi- 
ness! Thafs what we*ve bufit out 
of nothingness, just as the fusorians 
build our worlds for us out of thin 
gas and energy. Why, when Harry 
Hickson and I came here — ” 

He broke off and tugged at his 
chin, frowning at Boysie Oann. 
“Yes?” said Gann. “You and Hick- 
son — ?” 

“It was different then,” said Dr. 
Snow shortly. “Boy, do you stiB 
want us to believe that story erf 
yours about Hickson? A man I 
helped to bury myself, right under 
the rocks of hn home?” 

Gann said carefully, knowing 
that he was on dangerous ground: 
“Well, sir, ol course I dort know 
STARCHILD 



anything about Hickson. But what 
1 told you was true. The man who 
summoned Quarla said he was 
Harry Hickson, and I had absolute* 
ly no reason at all to doubt him at 
the time.” 

Snow nodded somberly and said 
no more; but Gann noticed that 
he no longer seemed to enjoy his 
meal. 

Gann put the matter from his 
mind. He was thinking of some- 
thing bigger. 

He was thinking of the gratitude 
of the Machine when he returned, 
riding one of Quarla Snow’s space- 
lings, as she was even now teaching 
him to ride — bringing word of the 
community of Freehaven and its 
precious crop of several thousand 
splendid candidates for tissue salv- 
age at the Body Bank! 

H e rose and strolled with Quarla 
outside. Harry Hickson’s pet 
pyropod, which Quarla had insisted 
on rescuing from the cave when 
her father arrived to take them off 
the reeflet, hissed and slithered 
around Ae area outside the door 
where its staked diain permitted it 
to move. 

He took her hand and held it, as 
they looked over the green ramble 
of glowing vines toward the distant 
beac<m tlat was the central urban 
area of Freehaven. “You promised 
to let me ride one of your space- 
lings,” he said, squeezing her hand 
and grinning. “If Fm going to be a 
permanent inhabitant here, Fd bet- 
ter get started learning my way 
around.” 

She looked at him thoughtfully, 

39 




then smiled. Under her golden hair 
her eyes were an intense blue. 
“Why not?” she said. “But not out 
of the atmosphere, Boysie. Not at 
first.” 

“I thought the spacelings brought 
their air with diem — ” 

She nodded, but said firmly: 
“Not out of the atmosphere. For 
one thing, there might be pyro- 
pods.” 

He scoffed: “So close to Free- 
haven? Ncmsense, Quark! Whafs 
the other thing?” 

She hesitated. “Wdl,” she 

began — 

She was saved the trouble of an- 
swering. A pale bhie wash of 
energy brightened up the sky over 
their heads. 

Both of them turned to look; a 
spacecraft was coming in for a 
landing, full jets blazing to slow 
its racing drive. Whoever it was 
who was piloting the craft, he was 
in a hurry. In a matter of seconds 
the ship was down on the lichenous 
kwn before Dr. Snow’s clinic, its 
lock open, a man leaping out. He 
glanced toward Quarla and Boysie 
Gann, cried, “Emergency!”, and 
turned to receive something that 
was being handed to him out the 
lock of the ship. 

Quarla cried: “I’ll get my father. 
Boysie, run and help them!” Gann 
was already in motion, hurtling 
across the lichenous ground, though 
the two men in the rocket needed 
Bttle help. What was coming 
through the lock of the ship was 
a man on a stretcher, wrapped in 
white sheets. In the light gravity 
of the Reef the two of them were 



perfectly adequate to handle it 
Gann lK>re a lumd anyway. 

“Sick,” panted one of the men. 
“Don’t know who he is, but he 
collapsed in my spaceling corral. 
Thought it might be something 
dangerous — ” 

Gann nodded, helped lift the 
stretcher on which the sick man 
was thrashing and babbling — 

And almost dropped it, light 
gravity or not. 

He stood there, jaw hanging, eyes 
wide. 

Face streaming with perspiration, 
eyes vacant, head tossing from side 
to side in delirium, the face of the 
man on the stretcher was neverthe- 
less very familiar to Boysie Gann. 
It was the face of Machine Colond 
Mohammed Zafar. 

I f ever Boysie Gann had 
needed all the wits and wiles 
that had been drummed into him 
in the spy school on Pluto, now 
was the moment. “Dangerous,” the 
reef-rat who had brought Zafar 
had called him. He was more than 
dangerous, he spelled a strong 
probability of disaster for Boysie 
Gann. Zafar of all people would 
know him — and if, as Gann was 
morally certain, Zafar and M’Buna 
had been joined in some anti-Plan 
scheme on Polaris Station, Zafar 
would surely now know that Gann 
was no simple radar tech. 

He dared not risk Zafar’s recov- 
ering consciousness and identifying 
him. 

Yet his every loyalty to the Plan 
of Man demanded that he take 
every chance to learn more about 



36 



IF 




Zafar from die cdond’e di^ointed 
Havings. 

Dr. Snow made it easf for him, 
widiout knowing it "You, boyi" he 
snapped. "Stay out of here. Quarla, 
loo! May be contagious . But 
stay where I cmi find you if 1 need 
you,” he added, bending over his 
patient 

The two of them stood at the 
door of the emergency room, 
Quarla’s hand, forgotten, in Boysie 
Gann’s. He’s bad, Boysie,” she 
whispered. "Don’t know what h is. 
1 haven’t seen anything like that 
since Harry^ — ” Then she stopped, 
and went on in a different tone, 
to the men who had brought him: 
"You’d better wait until my father’s 
examined him. You might have 
been exposed.” 

In the emergency room Dr. 
Snow was lifting a bimetal thermo- 
meter out of Zafar’s slack mouth, 
mumbling incoherently. Boysie 
Gann strained to hear what the 
man was saying, but all he could 
catch were words like ". trap for 
minds. "... living dust and lying 
dreams. .” 

Dr. Snow’s expression was seri- 
ous. "High,” he muttered, then 
^anced toward the group at the 
door. "Quarla!” he called. "You’ll 
have to compound an injection for 
me. Standard broad-spectrum anti- 
biotics, afebrilium, analgesics. Call 
his weight — let’s see — ninety 
kilos. And make the dosage maxi- 
mum.” 

Quarla nodded and hurried to 
the pharmacy room, while Snow 
bent back to ibe man. Even at this 
distance, Gann could see fiiat the 



fonner machine colonel’s face ^ wat 
contcurted in agony and fear. There 
was more than sickness in Zafar’s 
wild muttering, there was terror. 
He pushed himself erect, eyes star- 
ing, and shouted: "Graveyard of the 
galaxy! Starchild! Beware the trap! 
Beware your heart’s desire!” Then 
Quarla was back with a spray hy- 
podermic. Her father took it from 
her, pushed her out 6f the room 
again and quickly injected the man. 

Zafar slumped back onto the ex- 
amining couch, eyes closing, still 
mumbling to himself. 

The doctor watched him for a 
second, then came toward the 
group at the door. "He’ll sleep for 
a while,” he said. "Nothing else to 
do at this moment. We’ve got to 
see how he responds to the drug.” 
The man who had brought him 
said, "Doc, what is k? Are we ^ 
going to — ?” But Dr. Snow was 
shaking his head. 

“I can’t answer your questiem,” 
he said. "I don’t know what k is. 
But I don’t think you’re in any 
danger. I’ve only seen one other 
case like this, three years ago. But 
I was exposed, and so was my 
daughter, and several others — and 
no one was infected.” 

He hesitated, glancing at Gann. 
He said abruptly, "The other case 
was Harry Hickson, Mr. Gann. It 
killed him.” 

Boysie Gann started to speak, 
then nodded. "I understand.” 

"Do you?” Dr. Snow’s voice was 
heavy with irony. "I don’t! I don’t 
understand at all. Let me show you 
something — then tell me if you 
understand!” He stood away from

the door, reached out a hand and 
switched off the lights in the emer- 
gency room. ‘Took!” he cried. “Do 
you understand that?” 

The four in the doorway gasped 
as one. “Father!” cried Quarla, and 
the men swore softly. Inside the 
emergency room, in the semi-dark- 
ness Dr. Snow had brought about, 
Mohammed Zafar’s leather-colored 
skin was leather-colored no longer. 

Like the spilled blood of the 
spaceling Gann had seen murdered, 
^far’s skin was bright with a gold- 
en glow! His' face shone with the 
radiance of a muted sun. One 
wasted hand, dangling out of the 
sheets, was limned in a yellowish, 
unsteady light like the flicker of a 
million flashing fusorians. 

Quarla choked: “It’s — it’s just 
like Harry, father!” 

The doctor nodded somberly. 
“And it will end the same way, 
too. Unless there’s a miracle, that 
man will be dead in an hour.” 

He sighed and reached to turn 
the light on again, but there was 
an abrupt hissing, swishing sound 
and something darted past them, 
over their heads. “What the devil!” 
cried Dr. Snow, and turned on the 
lights. 

Something was on the dying 
man’s head, something that scuttled 
about and glared at them with hot 
red eyes, like incandescent shoe- 
buttons. 

“Father! It’s Harry’s — I mean, 
it’s the pyropod! The one Boysie 
and I brought back!” cried Quarla 
Snow. 

Gann said tightly: “Look! He 
broke the chain.” And then he 

38 



laughed shakily. “Harry would b8 
pleased,” he said unsteadily. “At last 
the thing’s learned how to fly.” 

M achine Colonel Zafar lived 
longer than the hour Dr. 
Snow had promised, but it was ob- 
vious that the extra time would 
not be very long. He was sinking. 
For minutes at a time he seemed 
hardly to breathe, then roused him- 
self long enough to mumble inco- 
herent phrases like: “T^e Starchildl 
But the Swan won’t help him. .” 
Snow was working over his lab- 
oratory equipment in the corner of 
the room, pausing every few min- 
utes to check his patient’s breath- 
ing, and shake his head. He sum- 
moned Quarla and Gann to him 
and gestured to a microscope. 

“I want to show you something,” 
he said, his face somber and won- 
dering. “Look.” And he stepped 
aside. 

Quarla looked into the slim 
chromed barrels of the microscope, 
then lifted her head to stare ques- 
tioningly at her father. He nodded. 
“You see? Mr. Gann, look.” 

Slowly Boysie Gann took her 
place. “I’m not a scientist, Doctor,” 
he protested. “I won’t know what 
to look for.” 

But then he was looking through 
the eyepieces and his voice stopped. 
He did not need to be a scientist 
The spectacle before him, standing 
out clear in three dimensions in the 
stereoscopic field of the microscope, 
was nothing he had ever seen before. 

Straw-colored erythrocytes and 
pale eosinophils floated among col- 
onies of benign microorganisms that 



IF 




live in every human*s blood. Rodlike 
and ameoboid, radial or amorphous, 
all the tiny bacteria were familiar. 
In a vague, half-remembered way, 
to Gann. 

All but one. 

For dominating the field were 
masses of globular bodies, dark and 
uninteresting looking at first, but 
bursting under his eyes into spurts 
of golden light. Like the luminous 
plankton of Earth’s warm seas, they 
flared brilliantly, then subsided, then 
flared again. It was like tiny warn- 
ing lights signalling disaster in the 
sample of the sick man’s blood — 
hundreds of them, perhaps thou- 
sands — so many that the field of 
the microscope was brilliantly illu- 
minated with a flickering golden 
glow. 

“Great Plan!” whispered Boysie 
Gann. “And this is what made him 
sick?” 

Dr. Snow said slowly, “It is the 
same thing I saw in Harry Hick- 
son’s blood. Just before he died.” 

He took his place at the twin 
eyepieces and glanced for a second 
at the tiny golden spheres. “Fusor- 
ians,” he said. “It took me a month 
with paper chromatography and 
mass spectrograms to verify it in 
Harry’s blood, but that is what they 
were. Colonies of fusorian symbiotes 
gone wild. They’re killing him.” 

He stared blankly at the micro- 
scope, then roused himself and hur- 
ried back to his patient. Machine 
Colonel Zafar was gasping for 
breath, his eyes wide and fixed on 
the ceiling, his fingers working aim- 
lessly, his whole skin suffused with 
that golden glow. “Quarlal” rapped 



Dr. Snow. “Seal the roomi We*i 
give him a positive partial pressure 
of oxygen! ... It won’t save hk 
Kfe,” he added wearily. “But it may 
prolong it — by minutes, at least.” 

The girl hurried to close the door 
tightly against its resilient seals, while 
her father adjusted valves on his 
mediconsole. Boysie Gann heard a 
“white” sound of hissing gas and 
felt a quick increase of pressure in 
his ears. He swallowed and heard 
Quarla’s voice, queerly distant, say: 
“Father! He’s — he’s trying to get 
up!” 

Machine Colonel Zafar was sitting 
up. 

His eyes were less remote, his 
breathing easier in the hypobaric 
atmosphere. But the golden glow 
was even more intense, the perspira- 
tion streaming from his brow. 

And his eyes were on Boysie 
Gann. “You!” he cried. “Swan take 
you! Get back to the Machine, you 
traitor!” And he made the curious 
looping gesture with his arm that 
Gann had seen in Harry Hickson . 

A nd tfien Boysie Gann remember- 
ed what the star was that lived 
in the heart of the Swan. 

“Alpha Cygni!” he cried. “Den- 
eb!” The star in the constellation 
of the Swan!” 

Zofar fell back on an elbow, glar- 
ing at him. “Your dirty mouth pro- 
fanes the sacred name,” he hissed. 
“The Starchild will punish you. In 
the heart of the Planner’s citadel — 
in the bowels of Terra, where the 
Machine plays with its human toys 
— the Starchild will seek out and 
destroy its enemies 



STARCHILD 



If 




His eyes closed and he gasped for 
breath. Gann looked at Quarla and 
her father, but their expressions 
were as clouded as his own. “Star- 
child?” whispered the girl. “Father, 
do you know what — ” 

The doctor rumbled: “No, Quar- 
la. I know nothing. Only rumors. 
A myth that there is a Starchild, and 
that he will bring the faithful of 
the Church of the Star home to 
Deneb’s planets one day.” 

“No rumor!” shouted the glow- 
ing, golden man, and paused to 
cough hackingly. “The Starchild 
lives! I’ve seen him in the heart of 
the Whirlpool! He has touched me 
with his radiant hand!” 

But Dr. Snow was beside him, 
thrusting him back down on the 
bed, hushing him. “No!” cried Za- 
far wildly. “Don’t stop the word 
of the Starchild! See here!” 

And with a convulsive effort he 
drew out of the pouch of the one 
garment he still wore a stiff cream- 
colored sheet of parchment. “The 
Writ of Liberation!” he shouted. 
“The Starchild gave it to me to send 
to Earth. And I send it — now!” 
The pyropod that had belonged 
to Harry Hickson scuttled wildly 
about, its red eyes bright orange in 
the high-oxygen air. It hissed and 
shook its scales; and Zafar’s eyes, 
too, were almost orange — glowing 
with tiny, dancing golden atoms, 
even in the pupil. They seemed 
blind — or fixed on something far 
more distant than the walls of the 
doctor’s clinic. 

Boysie Gann felt a shudder, as 
though the floor of the room were 
shaking. It had not moved. 



He staggered and thrust out a 
hand to support himself, yet there 
was no motion. “To Earth!” cried 
the sick man, and threw the sheet 
of paper from him. “Swan, carry 
it! Starchild, guide it! To Earth . .” 
he broke off. 

The doctor tried again to calm 
him, but the dying man thrust him 
aside. “To Earth!” he cried. “And 
you — spy, traitor, slave of the Ma- 
chine! Swan take you . 

Gann opened his mouth to say 
something, anything, ' but words 
would not come. The room lurched 
again, more violently. Sickeningly. 
The others did not seem to notice, 
yet the shock came again. He stum- 
bled and almost fell, caught him- 
self and reached out instinctively for 
the fluttering sheet of paper Zafar 
had thrown into the air. 

It slipped away from him . and 
disappeared. 

One moment it was there. The 
next moment it was gone. 

Where it had been Gann saw a 
queer flow in the atmosphere, like 
flawed glass, spinning. 

The whirlpool grew. It enlarged 
and came near him, and the room 
moved around him once more. Fran- 
tically he tried to lejq) back, save 
himself, but he was falling, falling 
into the whirlpool . falling . 

. and falling . 

He fell for what seemed to be a 
thousand years, while the room 
turned queerly dark and disappear- 
ed. Quarla’s worried face, the doc- 
tor’s look of shock, Mohammed 
Zafar’s dying glare of hate — all 
disappeared, and around him he saw 
the dim shapes of stars and planets.

of galaxies and dust douda, i^i^ing 
and glowing . 

He fell for a long time, throu^ 
what seemed to be a distance of 
billions upon billions of empty, air- 
less miles — 

And was. 

For when the falling stopped and 
he staggered, shaken and frantic to 
hig feet, he fell flat and cut his face, 
bloodied his nose, against a gray, 
soft-lighted metal floor. 

He was in full Earth gravity. 

He was on the Reefs no longer. 
He was on a planet. And around 
him stretched long empty corridors 
of metal walls and spinning tapes 
and glittering lights. 

Machine Major Boysie Oann was 
home at last. He was in the cata- 
combs under Earth’s surface that 
housed the mighty electronic masses 
of the Planning Machine. 

VI 

A nd diat was how it began for 
Boysie Gann, with a twenty 
billion mile drop that landed him 
in a place where no one could pos- 
sibly be, in the heart of the Machine. 

A warm wind blew between the 
narrow walls of the corridor. There 
was a faint distant hum, overlaid 
by the whir and hiss of rushing tape, 
the drone of enormous far-off ma- 
chines. Gann stood up, gasping with 
the effort of moving his new weight 
— nearly a hundred kilos, when for 
months he had had to carry only 
a fraction of that, or none. He 
looked around, dazed; 

He was in a long corridor. At the 
end of it, hundreds of yards off. 



was a brighter light that seemed 
be a room. 

He stumbled toward it, stanching 
the flow from his nose with the 
back of a hand, coughing and tast- 
ing the acrid blood at the back 
his mouth. 

The gray light turned out to come 
fr^m a strange, roimd chamber, its 
roof a high concrete dome. The 
great floor was broken with little 
island clusters of consoles and con- 
trol panels, ^unattended. The wall, 
almost circular, was pierced with 
twenty-four dark tunnels like the 
one he had come from. 

Gann leaned dizzily against the 
frame of the door though which 
he had entered for a moment. Then, 
summoning his strength, he shouted: 
‘‘Help! Anyone! Is anybody here?” 

The only answer was a booming 
echo from the great concrete dom^ 
and the distairt whirring of the 
tapes. 

The control stations were empty, 
the corridors vacant Yet, as Gann 
stood diere, he began to feel that 
the place was somehow alive. As the 
echoes died away his ears began to 
register fainter, more distant sounds 
— a muffled mechanical murmur, a 
hum and whir. All the corridors 
were as empty as the one he had 
left He peer^ into them one by 
one, saw nothing but the endless 
banks of computing equipment, the 
jungle of thick cables that roofed 
them. 

Almost cm tiptoes, humbled by the 
immense hush around him, Gann 
went to the circular islands of con- 
soles in the middle of the chamber. 
One unit, glowing with illuminated 



STARCHILD 



41 




dials and buttons, faced each radiat- 
ing tunnel. He stood entranced, 
watching the race of indicator lights 
across the face of each console. 

He had never seen this place in 
his own person before, yet it was all 
familiar to him, had been repeated 
a hundred times, from a hundred 
angles, in the texts and visual-aid 
lectures at the Technicorps academy. 

He was in the very heart of the 
Planning Machine — the most sec- 
ret, the most elaborately guarded 
spot on nine planets. The nerve cen- 
ter of the Plan of Man. 

And the Planning Machine did 
not even know he was there! 

That was the fact that most shook 
Boysie Gann, almost terrified him 
— not only for himself, although 
surely he was on dangerous ground, 
men had gone to the Body Bank for 
far less. His fear was for the Plan 
of Man itself. How was it possible? 

With all its storage of facts on 
every act of every human being in 
the plan — with its great taped mass 
of data covering every field of 
knowledge, every scientific discov- 
ery, every law — the Planning Ma- 
chine seemed to have no way of 
telling that an unauthorized human 
being was at large in its very heart. 

Gann found himself sobbing. Diz- 
zied, he clutched at the edge of the 
nearest console and frantically tried 
to make sense of the unfamiliar glit- 
ter of dials and scopes and racing 
lights. There was a linkbox! For a 
moment he was hopeful — yet the 
link boxes to the Machine were meant 
only for those who had received 
communion, who wore the flat plate 
in their skulls that gave the Machine 



access to their cranial nerve cen- 
ters. Dared he use the linidbox? 

But what else was there? Gano 
thought swiftly, crazily, of punching 
a button at random — ^throwing a 
switch — turning a chaL Any smafl 
change would alert the Machine. 
Serving robots or human techs would 
be there in moments. 

And then his eyes oau^t sight of 
a small, flat red plate, bearing a 
single bright-lit button, and one 
word. It was at the top of the con- 
sole nearest him. The single word 
was: STOP 

He stood staring at it for a long 
moment, forgetting to breathe. 

If that plate meant what it so 
clearly, unequivocally said, he had 
it in his power to — to — 

To stop the Machine, 

Machine Major Boysie Gann, 
Technicorps academy graduate, vet- 
eran of the spy school, trained and 
toughened against the worst a solar 
system could produce, found himself 
babbling in terrified hysteria. Stop 
the Machine! The thought was un- 
bearable. 

He flung himself on the linkbox, 
found a switch, wept, babbled and 
sobbed into it. He was not speaking 
in the Mechanese that the Machine 
had developed for the links — didn’t 
know it — would have forgotten it 
if he had known it. He was literally 
terrified, as nothing in his life had 
ever terrified him before. 

When the squad of Plan Guards- 
men in Machine gray came boiling 
out of the access elevators, racing 
down the corridors, their weapons at 
the ready, they found him slumped 
on the floor, all but unconscious. 




Boysie Gann nearly died right 
^en, with twenty bullets in his 
body. 

But the Techtenant in command 
issued a sharp order. He peered won- 
deringly at Gann, restrained his men, 
thought tor a second, then shook his 
head. “Don’t hurt him,” he growled. 
“Or not so he can’t talk! Let’s get 
him up to the security office — 
fast!” 

F or four days Boysie Gann was 
questioned around the clock by 
the brawniest bullies in the Techni- 
corps, and they were not gentle 
with him. 

He answered all their questions — 
told the absolute truth — and paid 
for it with the impact of a club 
against his kidneys, a kick in his 
ribs. They knocked him unconscious 
a dozen times, and each time he re- 
vived again with a hardfaced med- 
ical orderly pulling a hypodermic 
out of his skin, brought back to face 
more interrogation. 

Finally they let him sleep — not 
because they were satisfied with his 
answers, but because the medics 
feared he would die. 

When he awoke he ached in every 
part of his body. 

He was strapped to an operating 
table. The Body Bank, he thought 
at first in a surge of panic. But it 
was not the Body Bank; it was a 
prison. Clearly the medics had been 
working on him. Although he ached, 
be could move. His toes> curled, his 
fingers responded to his brain. His 
eyes opened, and moved where he 
willed them. 

Only one thing was different: 



there was a cold, hard pressure 
around his neck. 

The security collar that Harry 
Hickson had removed so easily had 
been replaced. 

Men were all around him, remov- 
ing the straps, forcing him to his 
feet. “You! Risk.” growled one of 
them, a radar-horned NCO with a 
chin that was stubbled blue with 
beard. “On your feet! You’re going 
to talk to the general.” 

They hurried him through gray- 
walled corridors to an elevator. It 
rose with a sickening thrust of ac- 
celeration, stopped as rapidly. Gann 
nearly fell, but was thrust to his 
feet again by one of the guards. 
“Out! Move on. Risk!” And he 
stumbled through more corridors, in- 
to a bare gray office, and there he 
stood at attention for a long, long 
time, waiting. 

Then — Boysie Gann heard no sig- 
nal, but perhaps it had been relayed 
through the radar-horned helmet of 
the guards — the security guardsman 
barked: “In there!” and thrust him 
through a door. 

Gann entered into a larger, 
brighter office. It was beautifully 
furnished, with a bust of the Plan- 
ner in glowing gold smiling down 
from a pedestal, and a golden link- 
box to the Machine dominating the 
desk. On the desk was a nameplate. 

Machine General Abel Wheeler 

And the man who sat behind it 
was the general himself. 

He sat regarding Boysie Gann for 
a long moment. Machine General 
Wheeler seemed more than half a 



fTARCHILD

nachine liimsdf. He was a Ug man, 
an angular, perplexing, i^>rupt-mov- 
ing man. ^ole body looked 
metallic: skin-tan of bronze, eyes the 
color of steel, spikes of copper wire 
for hair. He stared at Gann and 
then, without a word, looked away, 
his eyes going to something invisible 
on his desk. 

Boysie Gann fdt choked by the 
Hard, cold oonstriction of the secur- 
»ty collar. Bruises aching, skin clam- 
my with sweat, he stood painfully 
•igid. At the Technicorps academy 
le had learned the art of standing 
indlessly at attention — the imper- 
:eptibly slow shifting of weight and 
muscular tensions that kept a man 
from pitching forward on his face. 
He blanked out his mind, thought of 
nothing but of the importance oi 
standing there. 

The general’s frowning eyes clung 
to the tilted communications screens 
that faced him on his desk, invisible 
to Gann. After a moment he tapped 
soundless keys, communicating, 
Gann knew, wiA the Machine. Gann 
wondered Aat he did not use the 
linkbox. It did not occur to him that 
the general might fear that Boysie 
Gann, the man who had appeared 
inexplicably in the heart of the 
Planning Machine’s caverns, might 
equally inexplicably have learned to 
understand Mechanese. 

The general waited, reading some- 
thing, frowning stiffly. 

Abruptly his head jerked up and 
he stared at Gann. 

T he screens had ceased to flicker. 

His flat bronzed face was ex- 
pressionless. It was a mask of meat. 



as though some bungling surgeon li' 
the replacement center had failed to 
connect the nerves and muscles that 
would have given it life. 

General .Wheeler said sharply: 
“Machine Major Boysie GannI" 
Gann jumped; could not help him-, 
self; the voice was like a met^ rasp. 
“You may stand at ease!” 

Gann let his lean shoulders sag 
slightly forward, drew a long breath, 
shifted his feet. But he was not real- 
ly at ease. General Wheeler’s eyes 
were on him, steel-colored, as coldly 
merciless as though they were the 
probes of a surgeon planting elec- 
trodes in his brain. He snapped: 
“The Machine requires information 
from you.” 

Gann said painfully, “I know, sir. 
I’ve already been interrogated — • 
about a hundred times. I’d say.” 

“It will be a thousandl You wiH 
be interrogated again and again and 
again. The Machine’s need for truth 
is urgent.” Wheeler’s broad head 
jutted forward like the sudden thrust 
of a piston. “The Starchild! Who is 
he?” 

There was a dry lump in Gann’s 
throat. He swallowed and said stub- 
bornly: “I don’t know, sir. I’ve told 
everything I know.” 

“The Writ of Liberation! Who 
wrote it?” Gann shook his head 
“How did it get into the Planner’s 
headquarters?” Gann kept on shak- 
ing his head, hopelessly but obstin- 
ately. “And yourself, how did you 
get into the Planning Machine’^ 
tunnels? Who is Quarla Snow? 
Why did you kill Machine Colonel 
Zafar and make up this preposterous 
Ue— ?” 




“No, sir!” cried Gann. “I didn’t! 
Colonel Zafar was anti-Plan!” 

The general’s wide mouth hard- 
ened. His bloodless lips shut like 
the jaws of a trap. His voice was like 
a muffled, ominous clang: “The 

evidence,” he said, “suggests that 
you are lying. Can you prove you 
are not?” 

“No, sir. But — ” 

“Machine Major Boysie Gann! 
Are you the Starchild?” 

“No, sir!” Gann was honestly sur- 
prised, indignant. “I — ” 

“Machine Major Boysie Gann! 
Do you know what became of the 
Togethership?” 

Gann cried hopelessly: “The 

what? General, I never even heard 
of the — what is it? The Together- 
ship. 1 don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about.” 

Like the steady pulse of a laser 
scan, the general tolled: “The To- 
gethership went into space forty 
years ago. It was never heard ol 
again. Major Gann, what do you 
know of this?” 

“Nothing, sir! Why, I wasn’t even 
born!” 

For a moment the mask cracked, 
and the general’s face looked almost 
human. Worried. Even confused. He 
said after a moment, “Yes. That’s 
true. But—” 

Then he tightened up again, bent 
forward stiffly from the hips. His 
steel eyes narrowed. “Are you loyal 
to the Plan of Man?” he asked 
softly. 

“Yes, sir!” 

The general nodded. “I hope so,” 
he said bleakly. “For the sake of the 
Plan — and for your own sake, too.

STARCHILD 



For I am going to tell you something 
diat cannot ever be told again. U 
you whisper a word of it, Machine 
Major Boysie Gann, your death wBl 
come at once. At once, 

“You see, the Planning Machine 
is not unique. There is another one.” 
Gann’s eyes widened. “Anoth- 
er — ” he stopped, and had to begin 
again. It was like being told there 
were two Jehovahs, a second Christ 
“Another Planning Machine, sir? 
But where is it?” 

The general shook his head. 
“Lost,” he said somberly. “Another 
Machine — as great, as powerful, as 
complete as the one that guides the 
Plan of Man. And we do not know 
where it is. 

“Or what it is doing.” 

T here was a man name Ryeland, 
the general told Boysie Gann. 
A great mathematician. A brilliant 
scientist. The husband of the daugh- 
ter of the then-Planner, and close 
to the center of power surrounding 
die Planning Machine itself. And 
decades before he had gone into 
space, just as Gann himself had 
done, and seen the Reefs of Space, 
and come back with the tale of 
countless thousands of unplanned 
humans living their lives out on the 
fusorian worldlets, outside the scope 
of the plan. 

“What he said,” rasped General 
Wheeler sternly, “was false! But 
the Machine wisely determined to 
test it out! The Planning Machine 
does not leap to conclusions! It 
weighs the evidence — ^learns the 
facts — makes a plan!” 

“Yes, sir,” said Boysie Gann. 



“I’ve heard of this Ryeland, I think, 
A leading scientist even today!” 

The general nodded. ‘T’oday,” ha 
said cryptically, “Ryeland has aban- 
doned error. A loyal servant of tba 
Plan. And so is the former Planner 
Creery, who also has turned away 
from falsity. But then — ” He sighed, 
like the wheezing of a high-vacuum 
pump. 

Then, he told Gann, both men had 
been duped — and had caused the 
Machine to commit — not an error, 
of course. That was impossible to 
the Machine. But to conduct an ex- 
periment which failed. 

The experiment was to bring the 
Plan of Man to the Reefs. 

The Machine had directed the con- 
struction of a mighty spacecraft 
called the Togethership. The biggest 
space-going vessel ever built. A mo- 
bile spacefort. It was fabricated at 
the yards on Deimos, and powered 
with six detachable jetless drive units 
that were themselves great fighting 
ships. And more than half of its 
hull was filled with a slave unit of 
the Planning Machine — a linked 
bank of computers and storage 
banks, as advanced as the Machine 
itself, lacking only the network of 
communications and implementa- 
tion facilities that the Machine had 
developed out of the race of Man. 

The Togethership was built, 
launched, tested and fitted out. A 
selected crew was assembled and 
came aboard. Supplies were loaded 
for a ten-year cruise. The slave Ma^ 
chine assumed control — the To- 
gethership flashed out past Orbit 
Pluto — ^passed the Spacewall — and 
was gone. 



46 



IF 




Days later a message came back 
via laser relay chain. All was go- 
ing well. The Togethership had 
sighted a major cluster of the Reefs 
of Space. 

No other message was ever re- 
ceived. 

Machine General Wheeler paused, 
his steel-gray eyes on Gann. 

“No other message,” he repeated. 
“It has never been heard from again. 
Scouting vessels, attempting to lo- 
cate it, came back without having 
found any trace. Or did not come 
back at all. Or returned early, dam- 
aged, having been attacked by py- 
ropods or something worse. 

“That is the story of the To- 
gethershipy Major Gann. Except for 
one thing: The cluster of Reefs it 
last reported sighting was in the 
same position as what you have 
called Freehaven. And you were 
there. Major. What did you learn?” 

Wonderingly, Gann shook his 
head. “Nothing, sir. Believe me. Not 
even a rumor.” 

The general looked at him for a 
long second. Then he nodded. 
“Gann,” he said bleakly. “1 will tell 
you one more thing.” Abruptly he 
snapped three switches on his desk, 
glanced at a monitoring dial, nodded. 
“We are cut off,” he declared. “Not 
even the Planning Machine can look 
in on us now. What I have to tell 
you is for no ears but your own. 

“You see, Gann, it is not only the 
welfare of the Plan of Man that is 
involved here. I have a special in- 
terest in solving these mysteries. 
Solving them myself. 

“Major Gann, I intend to be the 
next Planner.” 



B oysie Gann was adrift in danger- 
ous waters, and knew it. 

He had heard rumors of the 
power-struggle of the human lead- 
ers who surrounded the great cen- 
tral power-fact of the Machine, 
jockeying for position, seeking per- 
sonal advantage. The Technicorps 
academy had been filled with sly 
jokes and blazing-eyed, after-dark 
discussions of it Some’ had viewed 
the political strife as treason (though 
they dared only whisper the 
thought). Some had taken it as a 
joke, or as a natural law of human 
affairs which they proposed to fc^ 
low for their own advancement 
Gann remembered the brother of 
the girl he had left at Playa Blanca, 
a white-hot idealist; remembered 
one of his instructors, a cynical 
humorist whose japes had seemed 
half in earnest and had set his 
classes wriggling with astonishment 
and something like fear. The in- 
structor had disappeared one day. 
The young cadet who was Julie 
Martinet’s brother had become an 
honor student at the Academy. He 
had even gone on to spy school on 
Pluto, just as Gann himself was 
leaving. 

But idealist or cynic, whatever the 
attitude of the individual, the whole 
question of political maneuvering 
had been remote. It was something 
that took place far off, high up — not 
in the life of Boysie Gann. 

Not until now. 

Machine General Abel Wheeler 
leaned forward from his desk and 
rapped outihe words: “I n;ust know 
this. Do you know who sent the 
Writ of Liberation?” 



4F 



STARCHILD 




Gann shook his head. **Sir, Vv 
never even seen it. 1 don’t know 
what it says.” 

“Foolish threats. Major Gann! An 
insane promise to stop the sun’s 
light. A warning to the Planner and 
to the Machine that freedom must 
be restored — ^hah! And yet — ” the 
man’s steel eyes grew colder and 
more distant stih, as he contem- 
plated something far away — “it 
seems that there is something behind 
the threats. For the sun is indeed 
stopped.” 

He paused. Boysie Gann Uinked. 
“Stopped? The sun? SSr, I don’t un- 
derstand . 

“Nor do I,” rasped the general, 
“but that does not matter. What mat- 
ters is the security of the Machine. 
It matters particularly to me, since 
I am entrusted with its defense. This 
Writ of Liberation is a threat; I must 
protect the Machine against it. If I 
am successful, I will receive — a 
suitable reward. To those who can 
help me — ” 

He glanced about his spy-tight 
room, leaned farther forward still, 
and merely mouthed the words: “I 
can offer them rewards, too. Major 
Gann.” 

His steel eyes stabbed restlessly 
about the room, then returned to 
Gann. “Major,” he said. “I need you 
for a friend.” 

G ann was still turning over in 
his mind what the general had 
said about the stoppage of the sun. 
The sun? No longer shining in the 
iky? It was hard to believe. He shook 
himself free from the questions that 
were burning at him and said un- 



easily, “1 hope to be your frieodl» 
fir. But I sdn know nott^ig of die 
Starchfld.” 

The general nodded like a metro 
nome. “You w91 be questioned 
again,” he rapped out “This time, 
directly by the Machine, through 
one of its servitors — a human who 
has taken the Machine’s commuo 
ion and speaks db^ctly to it This 
will perhaps help you to remember 
certain things. It may even be that 
from the questions the acolyte asks, 
you may be able to deduce other 
things — ^perhaps even make a guess 
at things that are stored in the mem- 
ory banks of the Machine that even 
I do not know. If so,” he said, hk 
face a bronze mask, “I v/ill be in- 
terested. The choice is yours. My 
friend or my foe — and even now,” 
he added, his bronze jaws harden- 
ing, “I have power enough to pun- 
ish my foes.” 

He opened the switches again, 
danced at his communications 
screens, nodded, tapped out an an- 
swer and turned once more to Gann. 

“You will go now to Sister Delta 
Four,” he stated. “There your dired- 
link questioning to the Machine will 
begin. Major, look at this!” 

Unexpectedly he raised his right 
fist It clenched like a remote man- 
4>ulator into a bronze hammer. 
“This hand,” he droned somberly, 
“once belonged to someone else, an 
unplanned traitor who threw a 
bomb at the Planner. His aim was 
poor. He missed the Planner, but 
hh bomb shattered my own right 
hand. 

“My hand could not be r^aired 
by tile surgeons, so it was replaced. 



48 



IF 




With the hand of the would-be 
assassin.” 

The bronze fist slammed against 
the console. 

“Gann, remember this! If you fail 
to serve the Machine in the way 
that is first required, you will serve 
it in some other way — more than 
likely, in the Body Bank!” 

VII 

T he radar-horned guards were 
waiting. 

“Come on, Risk!” growled the 
NCO in charge, and once again 
Boysie Gann was thrust and dragged 
through the long gray halls, into the 
elevators, out again — and left . to 
wait in a bare gray room. 

Only for a moment. Then the 
guards came back, looking angry and 
confused. “Come on. Risk!” growled 
the NCO again — he seemed to 
know no other words, be able to 
speak in no other way — and Gann 
was taken out again. 

A girl was standing in the door- 
way, telling her sonic beads, her 
head bent. She wore the robe and 
cowl of one of the Machine’s com- 
jnuning acolytes, one of those adepts 
who had learned the Mechanese that 
Machine now spoke in prefer- 
ence to any other language, whose 
very brain centers were open to the 
touch of the Machine. As they 
passed she spoke to one of the 
guards. “Orders changed!” he said 
roughly. “Come along if you like — 
we’re going to the Planner!” 

Gann hung back, trying to turn 
and see her, but the NCO shoved 
him ahead. He could hear the girl’s 



oddly melodious voice, not so much 
speaking as chanting Mechanese 
in the quarter-tones of her sonic 
beads, but could not make out her 
words. 

She would be — what had Gen- 
eral Wheeler called her? Sister Del- 
ta Four. The one who ^yas to inter- 
rogate him. 

But he was going instead to the 
office of the Planner himself! 

In all his years of life under the 
Plan, Boysie Gann had never seen 
the Planner in the flesh. Few had. 
There was no need, with commun- 
ications reaching into every home, 
even every room under the Plan — 
and the Planner was something more 
than human, removed from even the 
condescending social intercourse of 
emperors. 

Gann shivered slightly. 

He was already assuming the at- 
titudes of the convict of any land 
or time. He feared change. He 
dreaded the unknown. And the Plan- 
ner represented a very large un- 
known quantity indeed. 

Again the tunnels, again the high- 
velocity drop of the elevators. Again 
Gann was thrust into a tiny room 
and left there. 

He was somewhere far under- 
ground. Listening, he could hear no 
sound except the muffled murmur of 
air from the duct overhead. The 
walls were an unpleasant yellowish 
gray — no longer quite the sterile 
Technicorps color, but tinged with 
Planner’s gold. Gann wondered if it 
were deliberate — or if it was mere- 
ly that this cell was so old, its oc- 
cupants viewed with so little favor, 
that the baked-in coloring of the 



STARCHILD 



49 




walls had yellowed with age. The 
ceiling gave a cold gray light. There 
was only one bare metal table, and 
one bare metal chair. 

The security collar was hard 
against his throat 

Gann sat down and laid his head 
on the table. His bruises were be- 
ginning to stiffen and ache. His brain 
was whirling. 

Confused images were filling his 
mind. General Wheeler and his men- 
acing hints of reward. Quarla Snow’s 
spaceling, and the pyropods. Julie 
Martinet. A daytime sky with the 
sun somehow gone out ... the sun- 
like fusorian globules in Colonel 
Zafar’s blood . Julie Martinet 
again, and Quarla Snow. 

He lived again the endless fright- 
ening drop that landed him in the 
bowels of the planet Earth, among 
the memory banks of the Machine. 
He saw again sterile Pluto’s vistas of 
ice, and the great slow spin of Pol- 
aris Station. He thought of the Writ 
of Liberation and wondered at the 
love for freedom of the Planless men 
of the Reefs — the love for freedom 
— the freedom to love — 

He thought again of Julie Mar- 
tinet, and submerged himself in 
memories of the Togetherness re- 
sort at Playa Blanca, the slight, dark 
girl he had heard singing, their 
golden dawn together on the beach, 
with the 'taste of salt spray on her 
lips. He could see her face as clear- 
ly as though she were in the room 
with him. 

‘^ulie,” he whispered, and she 
opened her lips to reply — 

“Come on, Risk!” she said queerly 
— roughly. “Get up! Move!” 



r ie radar-horned NCO was shak- 
ing him angrily. “Risk! Wake 

up!” 

Gann shook himself. He had been 
asleep. His arm was numb and 
tingling, where his head had rested 
on it. 

He was still dazed as they dragged 
him out of the cell, into another 
room — larger — brighter — fur- 
nished in splendor. It was all gold. 
Gold tapestries on the wall, show- 
ing the spinning worlds of the Plan 
of Man. Gold light fixtures, and 
gold trays on the golden tables. The 
floor a carpeting of gold, the fur- 
niture upholstered in a golden fab- 
ric. 

A guard stood by him at each side, 
gripping his arms. They brought him 
to the center of the room and stood 
there, waiting, while the NCO went 
to a gold-arched door and whispered 
to a Technicorps officer in the uni- 
form of the Planner’s guard who 
stood there. The officer nodded in>- 
patiently and held up a hand. 

The radar-horned guard turned 
and signaled to his men. Wait, 
Boysie Gann was very sure, with- 
out being told, of where they were. 
Beyond that door was the Planner 
himself. 

They were not alone in the room. 
Turning his neck — the grip of the 
guards did not allow him to turn 
his body — he saw that the acolyte 
girl, Sister Delta Four, was in the 
room, kneeling on a golden hassock, 
telling her sonic beads. She was 
slight. What small sight he could 
get of her face, under the great soft 
cowl, was oval, grave and pale. Her 
loose black robe fell to the floor 



50 



IF 




around the hassock. Her cape bore 
the luminous emblem of those who 
had undergone communion with the 
Machine — the symbolic ellipses of 
electronic orbits intertwined. 

The guards wrenched him straight 
again. One whispered to the other 
across him, “Watch! She’s going to 
go into communion.” 

Even in his precarious position 
Gann could not help wanting to see. 
He had never before been with an 
acolyte during communion. It was 
something to be desired — and dread- 
ed. 

If the deadly security collar 
around his neck was the stick that 
the Machine had invented to en- 
force the Plan of Man, the com- 
munion plate was the carrot that 
rewarded faithful service. 

Gann knew what it looked like. 
He thought he had caught a glimpse 
of it in the forehead of Sister Delta 
Four, the bright metal disk grafted 
into the skin, starred with its black 
pattern of holes that accepted the 
prongs of the communion plug. 

He knew that communion was 
supposed to be the perfect exper- 
ience. 

The communion plate was only its 
exterior s)mibol. It was in the brain 
itself that the delicate stereotaxia of 
the Machine’s neurosurgeons had 
done their finest work. Through elec- 
trodes wired to the plate in the fore- 
head, the Machine requited its de- 
serving servants with tuned electon- 
ic stimuli. Its messages flowed direct- 
ly into the pleasure centers of the 
brain. 

The perfect experience — for it had 
no taint of reality to corrupt tt, no 



bill presented in the form of ex- 
haustion or physical damage — no 
substance! It was the quintessence of 
pleasure. Stripped of tactile, visual, 
(^factory — of all sensual complica- 
tions — ^it was the great good thing 
that men had always sought, and 
found imperfectly as a side-effect of 
eating, or drinking, or inhaling the 
crisp air of a mountain morning, or 
sex. It was all of them, distilled and 
served up in a tidy package, received 
through a bright metal plate. 

It was so perfect, thought Boysie 
Gann wildly, that it seemed some- 
how wrong . 

“She’s getting ready!” whispered 
one of the guards, and Gann ven- 
tured to turn his head again to see. 

He succeeded — only for a mo- 
ment, but he succeeded. The guards 
were watching too, and loosened 
their grips just enough for him to 
turn. 

Sister Delta Four lifted the black 
hood to uncover her forehead. 

T here on the smooth white skin 
he saw the bright metal disk — 
saw it, trembled, looked away — 
looked back again, and saw clearly 
what his mind had rejected. 

He saw the face of Sister Delta 
Four. 

There was a hoarse whisper from 
the doorway. “Let’s go!” The guards 
started, and jerked him away, thrust 
him facing forward so that he saw 
the radar-horned NCO with a face 
like fury, beckoning them angrily, 
signaling that the Planner was ready 
for them now. 

But Boysie Gann fought them, 
struggled like a wild man. “No!” he 



STARCHILO 



51 




shouted. “Wait!” And he battled the 
astonished guards, trying to turn, 
to go back to the girl whose serene 
face he had seen, eyes closed, lifting 
the communion plug to her fore- 
head. 

The guards lashed out at him, 
struck him. He hardly felt the blows. 
He turned, breaking free of one of 
them, colliding heavily with the

the thick golden rug, the other 
guards leaping toward them. But as 
they fell, Gann saw the face again. 



He had been right. T^ere was no 
doubt. 

Sister Delta Four was Julie Mar- 
tinet. 

The girl he loved was now no 
longer entirely human. Her vows 
were no longer to him. She was an 
adjunct to the Machine, as depend- 
ent on it for her every bit of life 
and thought as some remote-direct- 
ed subsea mining dredge . and as 
little a part of the race of men. 

Julie Martinet had become a part 
of the machine.

fmoiy's problem ittdn't present 
any dUficultles. It was the 
solution that was complicated! 



Qing!ng a worried song Emory 
O Clark rode out on his umcyde. 
It was very eaiiy on a summer morn- 
ing soft with h<meysuckle and rosea, 
merry with bird calls. But Emory 
regarded none of those things. 

He wheels a straight line, green 
across the dew silver lawns, up to the 
entrance of the City Hall. There 
he slotted his unicycle, fingertipped 
the Welcome, and went up the 
hundred steps two at a time while 
the bronze doors were sliding apart. 

Recessed in deep shadow the 
four-story facade of the Master In- 
dex confronted him. 

“Emory Clark,” it welcomed. 



“Private dtizem. Single. 23 years 
164 days. Occupation garden-hobby- 
ist. Is it a question oir a problem?” 
“Your Honor, I have a problem.” 
“Problem number 101,” k assent- 
ed. “Series Bb37, year 2000, city of 
Atlanta, Georgia. Go.” 

“Your Honor, I have a mouse in 
the house.” 

Lights flickered ruminatively. 
“Mouse. Mus mus, harmless non- 
aggressive mammal, average lengUi 
7 centimeters not counting append- 
ages. Intelligence .009. Please restate 
your problem to show that it is a 
problem.” 

“Harmless — ^nonaggressive! What 



53 



do you call harmless nonaggressive? 
This beast has somehow entered my 
home — uninvited — and will not 

leave no matter what I say to it. 
And the worst of it is, it’s chewing 
on a fine stand of grass in my liv- 
ing-room garden and making itself 
a nest in there. I have been expect- 
ing to take a prize in the Garden 
Club Show with that grass. If that 
goes, what becomes of my hard-won 
position of leadership! My commun- 
ity status? My peace of mind?” 

“Which of these questions do you 
want answered first?” 

“Never mind those question, your 
honor. I only hope I never find 
out; and while I stand here palaver- 
ing another stalk of timothy may be 
falling. Just tell me how to rid me 
of mine enemy.” 

“Answering problem 101, series 
Bb37, year 2000, city of Atlanta, 
Georgia,” replied its honor, briskly. 
“First catch your mouse then trans- 
port it to any distance over one kilo- 
meter and it will be unable to find 
its way back.” 

Emory fidgeted his feet. “Your 
honor I already tried that. But ah 
I achieved was information: that 
mouse can dodge faster than I can 
grab. I need a gadget.” 

The Master Index reminded him 
that the law forbade manual com- 
bat with harmless nonaggressive 
creatures. But it agreed that if the 
mouse would not accept a ride a 
suitable gadget 8ould be used. A 
library pass tingled into a tray un- 
der a slot. 

“Permit to withdraw one hypothe- 
cator, model T, seven-day loan, re- 
newable. Best mousetrap ever in- 



vented. Success to your efforts,” 
and it switched off all its lights. 

Delighted, Emory pocketed the 
pass, strode over to the basement 
entrance, and leaped singing into 
the downshaft. 

All was peaceful in the gadget 
library because of the early hour. 
Emory presented his pass to the 
librarian, which slotted it with a 
businesslike snap. 

There ensued a wait of fifteen 
minutes which Emory sp6nt whis- 
tling. Then the permit came back 
stamped “Not On Shelf.” 

44T T Till you ask the Master Index 
▼ ▼ for a second choice!” inr 
quired the librarian. “Or will you 
wait until some other borrower re- 
turns an hypothecator!” 

“What, me wait while a wild ani- 
mal makes hay with my status sym- 
bols!” cried Emory, running for the 
upshaft. 

Lights were on in the audience 
hall, and Emory was third in line 
for his next permit; but its honor 
recognized him and his problem, and 
provided a permit for a transmog 
without delay. 

So Emory presented this at the 
gadget library and found that afl 
the transmogs were also out on loan. 

After several such trials and mis- 
ses, he appealed directly to the li- 
brarian. 

“Just tell me what you do have on 
shelf in the way of mousetraps. 
Any old kind of trap, just so I 
rescue my grass while there’s still 
some left.” 

“But,” protested its accuracy, “1 
am a finder, not a keeper. My

bins have always had plenty of 
everything, or if not the Master In- 
dex can recommend something else 
just as good and possibly better de- 
pending on circumstances unforesee- 
able, or if not or if not or if not or 
if not.” 

“Clear the request, your accur- 
acy,” said Emory, in some haste, 
seeing that the librarian was about 
to flip its catalog. “I will apply to 
the Master Index again.” 

By this time, the waiting line 
was so long that Emo^ had to 
take his place twenty steps back 
down outside the entrance. He was 
beginning to think about lunch but 
he held his place sturdily and re- 
ferred its honor back to problem 
101, etcetera, subsolution E, with a 
protest of these delays. 

“I realize, your honor, that s<^u- 
tions take as long as they take. But 
in this case time is of the essence.” 

“Certainly your solution is taking 
longer than it should,” agreed its 
honor. **1 have been able to locate 
such problems without this difficulty. 
Considering the number it may be 
that the community is having a 
plague of mice. This would justify 
the reactivatkm of a gadget factory. 
But as afl gadgeteers are humans, 
and therefore work only when they 
feel like h, this is on the human level 
of negotiation. Do you wish to be 
an emissary?” 

“Anything!” cried Emory. “Any- 
thing! My grass, my grass!” 

“I have now notified the Engi- 
neering-Hobbyists* Club,*’ its honor 
assured him, “with full details of 
your predicament.” Five address 
cards and an Emissary’s Badge

tinkled from slots into trays. “CaH 
on each of their committeemen and 
obtain their choice of a factory site. 
Once this is known, we will then also 
know which hobby club is using it 
now, and can seek the use of the 
space for your purposes.” 

Next day Emcwy was back at City 
Hall looking desperate. “Your 
honor, I have been able to locate 
only two of these five people so 
far, and they disagree. In the mean- 
time, another mouse had appeared, 
or may have been lurking all the 
while, for in the nest are five small 
mice, or possible six. All I know is 
that when I tried to count them the 
larger mice bit my finger, after 
which they went bac± to dancing in 
my garden.” 

He had to wait while its honor 
outlined the correct medical proce- 
dure and warned him against manu- 
al combat with small nonagressivo 
creatures. “Second warning,” it ad- 
ded, and rang a gong twice. 

“Nonaggressive!” exclaimed Em- 
ory. “If these animals are nonag- 
gressive, what’s an aggresive one 
like!” and the Mast^ Index pre- 
sented him with a zoo pass. 

S everal days later he had oc- 
casion to use it. He was can- 
vassing all members of the Engineer- 
ing-Hobbyist Club in the hope of ob- 
taining a committee able to agree 
on something. One of them was 
locksmithing a new zoo cage and 
after interviewing him, Emory 
found himself in conversation with 
the hobbyist who ran the zoo park. 

“Certainly is a great plague of 
mice,” agreed the zoo keeper. “Thii 

9§ 




is the only place you won’t fine 
mice. We have a lion, a tiger, a 
leopard, a puma — actually oidy <me 
house cat, but they all smell alike 
to mice. No mouse wffl ever go 
near a cat.” 

“Cats?” 1 

“Finest mousetrap ever invented,” 
he said. 

Emory leaped to the saddle with a 
whoop and hedge-hopped his uni- 
cycle all the way to City HaH and 
danced on the steps as the line 
moved up to his turn. 

However, the Master Index knew 
all that already and dieelared it- 
self unable to issue him a permit 
to borrow a cat. 

“If we turn loose a creature 
classified as aggressive, you would 
be in bigger trouble than you’re 
in now,” it explained. “The tiger, 
die lion, the puma and the rest of 
the cats are apt to kill people. The 
only small ones are the variety know 
as house cats, and be assured that 
diose also are far from tame,” he 
warned. 

Exasperated, Emory made a few 
remarks about the general situation 
and some of its particulars. He had 
said somewhat the same before and 
its honor told him so. 

“All you are doing is holding up 
die line,” it chided. “Emotion solves 
nothing but. the existence of emo- 
tion. I am myself restricted by law, 
as you are.” 

Regardless of what emotion might 
solve, Emory had feelings which 
had been kept hot by days of metho- 
dical endeavors. He turned to the 
waiting line and expressed his senti- 
ments. 



Everyone agreed with him. More 
than half of them were there on sim- 
Har errands. The community was 
overrun with mice. All anyone had 
been able to do was gadget them 
from one place to another. This 
provided the mice with fresh fields 
to conquer. 

“Reclassify the mice!” cried Em- 
ory, waving his fist above his head. 
The other citizens cried with one 
voice, “Reclassify the mice!” While 
Emory referred all that to its honor 
and demanded an answer. 

It’s answer was that it could only 
expound the law, not make it or 
change it. “But you, Emory Clark, 
private citizen, etcetera, have one 
vote and a human voice. If you 
want to get the mice reclassified, 
success to your efforts.” And it 
gave him a library pass for several 
hundred massive volumes of per- 
tinent data. 

There was nothing Emory could 
do but begin upon these studies. 
The whole community was up in 
arms; but reclassification was a 
world affair, in which the problems 
of one community are proportion- 
ately as small as is a mouse to a 
house. 

Emory had to face up to the fact 
that the Master Index had, as it 
said, limits. 

A t least, Emory now had leisure 
and impetus for study. His gar- 
dening occupation was no more, for 
the multiplying mice had taken over 
the premises to such an extent that 
he was sleeping out-of-doors under 
his unicycle cover. 

He had made a lot of new friends, 

IF

However, and when a man needs to 
adjust his frames of reference, con- 
ference can help. 

One of his first calls was upon 
Henry Adkins, the zoo hobbyist, a 
man who might converse intelligently 
on the subject of the classification 
of the creatures with whom mankind 
shares his universe. 

“Henry,” he said, “I am thinking 
of lobbying for Freedom for Cats 
as well as Down with Tyranny erf 
Mice.” 

Henry pulled at his chin. “It’s 
not that I would object to losing my 
show specimens, though I would,” 
he mused. “But if Leo ever gets 
loose in this town, you’d better move. 
That brute is not only large, he’s 
neurotic. But the house cat, now — I 
must admit, reluctantly, that there 
is a case of injustice. Bird Watchers’ 
Lobby, of course,” and he intro- 
duce Emory to the zoo’s only living 
specimen, a handsome Siamese male 
with a hard blue squint. 

“NankL Very gentle. Nanki is a 
lineal descendant of the original 
Nanki-Poo, and all those arc espe- 
cially gentle.” 

“But they catch mice nonethe- 
less!” 

“Mice, rats, snakes — of all house 
cats, a Siamese is the fastest and 
grabbiest.” 

Emory extended the hand of 
friendship to Nanki, who immediate- 
ly bit it. Emory snatched his hand 
back and stared at the oozing marks. 
“What was that about gentle!” 

“Oh, Nanki IS gentle — at heart 
he really IS, but he displays pseu- 
doneurotic behavior because he is 
lonely. The nearest Siamese queen 



to in the Topeka, Kansas, zoolog|i 
cal park.” 

Emory was already leaving, bal 
he paused, awed. “Say. You sound 
like a Master Index. And you’re 
just a human. You are, aren’t you? 
I wouldn’t even know which way il 
was to Topeka.” 

Henry waved a deprecating hand 
at the westering sun. “Just hobby- 
information, really.” 

It seemed that the aggressive spe- 
cies were dwindling so fast in cap- 
tivity that animal-hobbyists held 
conventions just to brag about the 
rare specimens they still had alive, 
and to swap stuffed ones. 

Emory looked at Nanki with 
more sympathy and less resentment 
The unfortunate beast must remain 
imprisoned though gentle at heart, 
until death, after which he would be 
stuffed and perhaps traded off, who 
knows where. 

“I forgive you, Nanki,” he said, 
wrapping his hand in his handker- 
chief. “I fed a sense of doom my- 
self.” 

T hen he went home, thinkinf 
profoun<Hy without any help at 
all from computers. His premises 
were in a state of ultimate disgrace. 
Cluttering mice ran everywhere, with 
cleaning machines scurrying anx- 
iously after little black droppings. 
The furniture was chewed, walls 
tracked. The dining-room disposal 
groaned over tainted food shoveled 
into it by the automatic checkup, 
while more food clicked restle^ly 
and temporarily into the pantry 
pockets. 

Emory admitted to the mice that 

SF 



ANSWERING SERVICE 




yActory seecoed to be theirs for the 
lime being. **But not forever. Mean- 
while, 1 choose other company. 1 go 
but be warned, 1 shall return.” 

With that, he switched off all 
the house power and turned grimly 
away. 

Once more he returned to the 
City Hall. But this time he merely 
applied for a Nansen passport. 

“I shall become an Emissary-at- 
Large,” he explained “wandering 
upon my quest until this matter is 
reclassified by the citizens of the 
world. A man does what he can,” 
he said humbly. 

“Success to your efforts,” and 
with routine courtesy, its honor 
flipped out the requested badge and 
turned out all its lights, for the day’s 
business was done and there was 
nobody in line behind Emory. He 
examined the jewel in the slanting 
light. It carried the code number of 
the Master Index and his own finger 
prints, and thus gave him welcome 
to the services of all the Indexes of 
tile world. He donned the badge and 
strode out of the building, humming 
solemnly in a baritone undertone. 

Next he called on a hostess-hobby- 
ist and obtained a picnic hamper of 
hinch. Then he paid another visit 
to the zoo keeper. 

“Henry,” he said, “right now 
there are some points we might not 
agree on. But some day you will 
understand.” With that, he punched 
Henry on the button, took his keys, 
and locked him into the monkey 
cage. 

Then he went to see Nanki, and 
emptied the basket of lunch before 
the indifferent cat. A mouse sprang 



out ol tile sandwiches — truly, the 
wh<^e city was being plagued with 
mice. 

Nanki came to life. He caught 
the mouse with a flying leap and 
ate it at once. 

Emory waited patiently and ap- 
provingly while Nanki finished his 
snack. Meanwhile he was drawing 
on a pair of long heavy riding 
gauntlets. 

“You and I can get along, Nanki,” 
he declared. He scooped Nanki into 
the hamper, snapped down the lid, 
secured it and swung the whole thing 
over his arm. 

In the monkey cage, Henry was 
trying to sit up. Emory wondered 
whether he had the heart to hit 
him again, and for that matter, 
whether he could safely attempt it 
now that Henry would not be sur- 
prised. 

“Next stop is going to be Topeka, 
Kansas.” He tapped the basket 
which was yowling in a loud nasal 
tenor. “What this world needs is 
more cats like this one. You going 
to try to stop me?” 

Henry’s eyes widened. He rubbed 
his aching jaw. “You din have hit 
tha har,” he grumbled. “Topeka tha 
way. I^ge pathword thith year, 
‘Leo he roar!’ Think you can ge i 
righ?” 

“Leo he roar,” and Emory roared 
for himself. Leo heard it and took 
it up. Other animals joined the 
chorus and soon the whole zoo was 
in an uproar. 

To this farewell, Emory sprang to 
saddle; and he and Nanki whirled 
off together towards the sunset, sing- 
ing new s(Migs. END

THE 

RECON MAN 

by WILSON TUCKER 



illustrated by MODEL 



He only lived for one day — 
and perhaps it was too longl 



I 

O wen Hall’s one day of life be- 
gan with uncertainty. 

In that first moment of total 
awareness he found himself stand- 
ing outside a door, facing a road 
that moved. 

The door had slammed shut be- 
hind him — after he had been shov- 
ed through it — although there was 
no distinct recollection of his pas- 
sage through the doorway, or who 
had done the shoving. It was rea- 



sonable to assume that the same 
hand was responsible for both. A 
thrust against the small of his back, 
a slam — and awareness of self and 
surroundings began with that. 

The light hurt his eyes. 

The sun was shining, the weather 
was bland and summery. Airy 
brightness engulfed him, contrasting 
sharply with the blackness* behind 
that door and the blackness which 
replaced memory. 

Owen turned his attention to the 
road. It rolled. 



59 





The moving roadway was actually 
a street, a wide and smoothly sur- 
faced street which flowed toward 
the rising sun at a speed equal to 
a fast walk. It appeared from the 
southwest, curving gently aroimd an 
endless series of low buildings as ft 
approached, and vanished into the 
southeastern distance. Owen inspect- 
ed the street with a growing sense 
of wonder; he guessed that it com- 
pletely encircled the city, and he 
knew without proof what it was. He 
had never before seen a Heinldn 
rolling road, bift there it was. 

There was no telling what science 
would do next! 

In the following moment that 
mysterious door behind him was 
yanked open and a woman shouted 
belligerently. Owen turned around 
to examine the newest discovery. 

T he woman popped through the 
door. She was perhaps thirty- 
five or forty years of age, and 
rather chunky about the middle, 
per hair was brown, her eyes were 
angry and her hands were large 
enough to push him through any 
door with ease. She was clad from 
neck to sandals in form-fitting pink 
clothing. Baby pink. The single gar- 
ment resembled mechanic’s cov»- 
alls and it was reasonably flatter- 
ing except for that bulge in the 
middle. The woman staggered as she 
approached him. 

‘What you doing here?” she 
shouted at him. “Told you to go to 
work. Go!” 

Owen murmured politely. “Hon- 
ey, you’re loaded.” 

Ignoring the accusation or per- 



haps not understanding it, the belli- 
gerent woman strode close, leaned 
over to peer into his eyes and 
splashed him with eighty-six proof 
breath. She bellowed. “Wiat’s 
wrong with you? What went wrong? 
How is your equilibrium? Huh?” 
“There’s nothing wrong with my 
equilibrium,” Owen retorted. “Did 
you shove me through that door? 
What’s the big idea?” 

“Can you walk without falling 
down?” 

“I might ask you the same thing.” 
Owen discovered that he posess- 
ed a baritone voice, and was pleased. 
He realized the pushy, loudmouth- 
ed woman wasn’t his wife; he didn’t 
have a wife. And he found time 
to wonder what he was doing there 
— wherever there was. The city was 
a new one on him. 

“Show me you can walk,” the 
woman demanded. 

Owen obediently marched back 
and forth along the path between 
the door and the street His legs 
were strangely weak and for a brief 
moment he felt like an infant learn- 
ing to walk, but then he mastered 
the technique as familiarity return- 
ed. It was like regaining an old skill. 
“Nothing to it,” Owen said. 
“Ready to go to work?” 
“Work?” Owen blinked. He didn’t 
particularly care whether he worked 
or not. It was a nice day; he’d just 
as soon go fishing if there was a 
stream handy. But he was certain he 
didn’t want to go back inside that 
door with the old harridan. “I guess 
so. What work? Where?” 

“Get on that road. Follow those 
men. Go.” 



60 



IF 




He craned his neck to look again 
at the rolling road and found it 
thinly populated. Owen revealed his 
surprise. Men were beginning to ap- 
pear from the southwest, singly and 
in small groups, riding past him to- 
ward some unknown destination to 
the east. They did not look at him 
or the swaying woman as they went 
by, but instead contented themselves 
with studying their shoes or the 
haircuts of the men in front. They 
traveled like zombies. 

‘‘What’s wrong with those guys?” 
Owen came around again to ques- 
tion the woman, but found that she 
had deserted him and was stagger- 
ing up the path to her door. He held 
his breath until she made it. The 
door slammed. 

O wen hesitated with indecision 
and then realized he just 
couldn’t jstand there all day. He join- 
ed the other men on the rolling 
load, swinging onto k awkwardly 
and very nearly losing his balance. 

That trick certainly wasn’t fami- 
liar. Owen braced his feet apart to 
keep his balance and noted witii a 
nnall envy that the other riders 
were having no trouble. Maybe ha 
could do better tomorrow. Unless 
he skipped out to go fi^ng tomor- 
row. 

Owen looked away from the city, 
staring across the road at the open 
countryside in hopes of finding a 
stream or even a promising gravel 
pit. Little more than a vast, unin- 
habited prairie met his searching 
eye. In the distance, already fading 
behind him, he discovered a small 
stand of timber but there were no 



birds or grazing animals to suggest 
water there. 

Perhaps twenty minutes later the 
moving road carried him past a 
square mile of broken monuments 
and tumbled tombstones, but he 
wasn’t interested in finding a fish- 
ing hole in an ancient cemetery. 
The prairie remained vacant. It re- 
vealed no farmhouses or cattle or 
people. The road carried him east- 
ward around the rim of the city as 
the sun climbed higher into the sky. 

There were no individual houses 
along the road, as Owen discovered 
after a while. He saw nothing but 
an unbroken row of buildings mo- 
notonously stacked side by side, 
their walls touching or clinging to 
each other. Men came out of count- 
less doorways, came from hundreds 
of apartments or rooms or even 
warrens along the way to join the 
other hundreds already on the road. 
They did not speak, did not gang 
together to gossip about this or that 
The men simply stood in one place, 
waiting stolidly. 

Owen thought that was pretty 
stupid. He walked across the road 
and stared into the face of a rider. 

“What’s the name of this here 
town, sport?” 

TTie fellow returned his stare for 
a fraction of a second and then 
dropped his gaze, pretending to 
study his feet. 

Owen bent down, craned his neck 
and peered up into the man’s face. 
“D’ya think the Senators will ever 
win a pennant?” 

The man turned around and rode 
backward to avoid him. 

Owen said aloud that was a hell 

61 



THE RECON AAAN 




of a thing for a grown man to do, 
and lost interest in the clod. On an 
impulse, and in an attempt to create 
a diversion, he trotted here and 
diere along the road, staring im- 
pudently into faces, saying nonsen- 
sical things to provoke a reply, de- 
fiberately sliding between a pair who 
i^peared to be traveling together, 
stepping on toes and jabbing with 
his elbows. 

He was ignored. His co-riders 
would not respond in any way nor 
even acknowledge his presence ex- 
cept to turn away when he thrust 
his face into theirs. Owen told 
them loudly they might as well be 
a pack of zombies. 

Still curious, he decided to ex- 
amine the mechanism of the road. 
Moving carefully to the edge of the 
rolling surface, he dropped to his 
knees and searched for a crack in 
the construction materials, seeking 
a space between the road itself and 
whatever bed it rested on. There 
was none. Owen thought that fail- 
ed to make sense. There had to be a 
separation between the two bodies. 
If the road was suspended on jets 
of air there ought to be little wheels 
of some kind to implant forward 
movement, or so it seemed to his 
unmechanistic mind. And of course 
diere should be a nameplate or 
something giving Heinlein credit — 
or revealing^ . his protective patent 
number. 

Owen was sitting there, puzzling 
it, when somebody tapped his shoul- 
der. A side glance revealed a pair 
of feminine legs clad in pink cover- 
alls. 

She was back. 



n 

O wen realized his mistake when 
he jumped up and said, ‘‘Hi, 
Mother! Did you bring the jug?” 
This woman was dressed in the 
same fashion, the same garment, but 
most decidedly she was not the same 
female he had last seen staggering 
up the path. Xbis new one was a bit 
taller, a trifle less mature about the 
bust and hips, and easily ten years 
younger. Her hair was sandy blonde 
and she had a minute brown spot 
on the tip of her nose. 

She asked, reasonably enough, 
“What were you doing down there?” 
“Looking for the little wheels.” 
“What little wheels?” 

“The little wheels this road runs 
on. 

“Did you find them?” 

“No.” 

“Do you feel all right? Are you 
well?” 

“Of course I am. Want to 
dance?” 

“Is your equilibrium satisfac- 
tory?” 

“Why do yovL people keep asking 
that?” Owen retorted with somo 
heat. “There’s nothing wrong with 
me — except that I don’t remember 
last night. Or yesterday.” 

The young woman peered at him 
with speculation. 

“What is a jiig?” 

“Booze.” 

“What is booze?” 

“Stuff that comes in a jug. You 
drink it.” 

“Why?” 

Owen said, “Oh, fudgel Go ask 
your sister.”

IF 




have no sister. Where did you 
originate?” 

“I don’t know — back there, 
somewhere.” Owen waved a negli- 
gent hand to indicate same vague 
distance behind him and almost 
struck a man standing there. He 
fedn’t been aware that anyone else 
was so near. The man blinked at 
his passing hand but did nothing 
else. 

To the waiting woman, Ow©n 
said dryly, ‘‘Here, watch this.” And 
he deliberately thrust a finger 
against the man’s nose, pushing it 
off center. At the same time he 
emitted a throaty, “BeepI” 

The man turned his back. 

“See that?” Owen demanded of 
the woman. “No guts.” 

“Why did you do that?” she 
wanted to know. 

“For the hell of it.” 

“Your behavior is certainly un- 
usual,” the pink woman admitted. 
*T suspect you are incomplete. Are 
you sure you don’t remember your 
point of origin?” 

“I wouldn’t go back there again 
if I did remember,” Owen said. 
“That dame was loaded but she 
wouldn’t share it.” He stared at the 
back of the man standing near them 
and suspected the fellow was lis- 
tening. Nosy zombie. Owen grasped 
the young woman’s hand and pull- 
ed her to the middle of the street. 

44]^Tow we can talk,” he explain- 

l^ed. “These guys give me the 
creeps.” 

The woman was startled by his 
action. 

“You touched me.” 



Owen looked M her chest. “Want 
an racore?” 

“No.” And then she did some- 
thing which startled him. Reaching 
for the breast pocket in his cover- 
alls she pushed her fingers down 
inside, rummaging around for some- 
thing. 

Owen looked down and discover- 
ed he was wearing dun-colored cov- 
eralls, His garment wasn’t nearly so 
weU tailored as hers, and of course 
he didn’t fill it in the same man- 
ner. All the men on the street were 
dressed as he was. 

“What are you looking for, lint?” 

She did not answer but instead 
searched the other of the two iden- 
tical pockets in his garment. Bodi 
were empty. Pulling the collar away 
from his neck she ran her fingers 
around the neckband without find- 
ing anything, and then frisked him 
by moving her hands down each 
sleeve of the coveralls. 

A small oblong bar of stainless 
steel was fastened inside one sleeve, 
above the wrist. The woman remov- 
ed it with an exclamation of annoy- 
ance and pinned the bar in its pro- 
per place, under the flap of one 
pocket. She then placed the flat of 
her thumb against the bar and gent- 
ly pressed it to his chest. 

For the sheer fun of it, Owen did 
the same to her. The yoimg woman 
was taken aback by the gesture but 
stood firm when she realized what 
he was doing. An identical bar of 
stainless steel was pinned beneath 
a pink flap, riding high on her 
breast. It gave softly as Owen push- 
ed. 

A sensation was transmitted to his 

IF 



64 




Ihumb, a peculiar sensation he did 
not immediately recognize. He 
pushed again. His thumb felt or read 
numbers, and then he knew he was 
reading a message imprinted on the 
bar. The thumb transmitted a leg- 
end: 

L//-702260-^02-136 
“That is enough,” she told him, 
and removed his hand from her 
body. 

Fascinated, Owen put a thumb to 
his own pocket bar. 

Recon /HAl^n^-30? 

“Hey,” he cried, “dig those crazy 
bug numbers! What’s that question 
mark for?” 

“Your original age is uncertain.” 
“I’m twenty-eight.” 

The pink and blonde doll zeroed 
In on that. “How do you know?” 

O wen blinked, parted his lips to 
attempt a rational explanation, 
and then paused, hung on a dilem- 
ma. He didn’t know how he knew. 
“Well, I just am, that’s all.” His 
thumb lingered over the identifica- 
tion bar a second time. “What does 
Recon /H mean?” 

She ignored the question. “Were 
you given instructions?” 

“I was told to follow these creeps 
lo work.” 

“Nothing else?” The doll again 
betrayed annoyance. “Weren’t you 
told to return, afterward? Don’t you 
recall your point of origin? What 
was the number on the door? Do 
you remember the woman there?” 
Owen shuddered. “I remember 
she was loaded.” 

“Loaded? She was weighted 
down?” 



“She was loaded with booze. You 
know, looped.” 

“I don*t know. What is looped? 
Where did she obtain the booze?” 
“How should I know?” Owen de- 
manded with irritation. “Mayb# 
she had a still in there.” 

“A still what?” 

“Honey, you’re a dull cat. Don’t 
you know anything? How’d you 
ever get to be strawboss’ around 
here without knowing anything? You 
pink babes are running this crazy 
place, aren’t you?” He examined 
the cute little brown spot on the 
tip of her nose. “Where did I come 
from, anyway? How’d I get into this 
zombie business?” 

“There is something terribly 
wrong here.” 

“You can say that again.” 

“But why should I repeat it?” 
“Oh, go fly a kite. I know, I 
know, what is a kite?” Owen shook 
his head with bewilderment. “No 
organization all the way down the 
line. Let’s start over.” And ho 
reached for the bar on her breast. 

She stepped back. “Stop that. Do 
you remember your name?” 

“Owen Hall.” 

“And you are twenty-eight?” 
“Yes.” 

“When did you cease being twen- 
ty-eight?” 

Owen said, “When the — ” and 
came up short, astonished at her 
question and his own attempt at an 
answer. 

He had almost answered. When 
fhe — what? Owen poked about the 
huge and nearly empty cavern which 
substituted for a memory. Some- 
thing was moving in there. 



THE RECON AAAN

He focussed on the object. An 
automobile. Th^e was a vague im- 
age and wondered what it had to do 
with him. 

“Do you remember anything 
prior to that door?^ 

“No. She just shoved me through.” 
“You don’t recall the location? 
The number?** 

“I haven’t the foggiest idea.** 
“But where will you spend the 
night?” 

r iat gave him pause. “I don’t 
know. I hadn’t even thought 
about it. Any park benches around 
here?” 

“What is a park bench?” 

“That’s what I thought,” he said 
gloomily. “Honey, whatever happen- 
ed to the Indiana I lived in?” 

“Is Indiana a town? I don’t know 
that name. But I think you should 
come to my place tonight. You sim- 
ply can’t go roaming around.” 
Owen’s jaw dropped. “Do you 
mean that?” 

“Certainly. You have to sleep 
somewhere indoors.” 

He stole a glance at the nearby 
men. “Won’t people talk?” 

“Talk about what?” 

“This sure as hell ain’t Indiana.'’ 
The blonde charmer gave him a 
small metallic plate about the size 
of a calling card. Owen moved his 
thumb over it, inwardly pleased at 
his new-found skill. The plate re- 
peated the legend he had already 
read on her bar, while immediately 
below that identification was anoth- 
er number he supposed to be a 
house number, or at least a door 
number to one oi the warrens along 



the road. Owen allowed his thumb 
to tarry over the plate and his ima- 
gination to play in the blonde hair. 
It was difficult to accept. 

“You want me to spend the night 
with you?” 

“I certaiidy do. I want to look 
into you; there is more than a 
suspicion that you are incomplete. 
Your present behavior isn’t normal, 
you know. It needs correcting.” 

“So what’s in it for me?” 

“The works,” she replied enigma- 
tically. “Obey your previous instruc- 
tions and then obey mine. When you 
are dismissed from your job report 
to this address.” And she left him 
as abruptly as she had come. 

Owen watched her swing off the 
road in expert fadiion. He even 
turned around to watch her excit- 
ing figure until it vanished in the 
distance behind him. Owen puUed 
himself from an erotic dream to 
find himsdf looking into the blank 
face of a blank man standing sev- 
eral feet away. 

“You poor sapi The trouble with 
you is, you’re all dieie. Know what 
I mean?” 

m 

T he rolling road eventually deliv- 
ered its human cargo to some 
large building Owen took to be a 
factory, or possMy a warehouse. 
There were no signs to indicate the 
nature of the place. For once he 
sorely missed the ubiquitous bill- 
board. The men ahead of Owen 
were leaving the road and entering 
the building in fiieir listless fash- 
ion, braving fike so many stereo- 



d6 



IF 




types on their way to another boring 
Aiy at the office. Owen followed 
them, knowing curiosity. A great 
doorway engulfed him. 

A factory, Owen decided. In that 
first quick glance around, he saw 
what appeared to be hundreds of 
machines of totally alien design, 
geared to produce something equally 
alien. There were no scraps of an]f- 
Ihing on the floor to lend a hint 
of the iwoduct, no stockpiles of raw 
material waiting to be fashioned. 
The incoming men pushed past him, 
scattering throu^ the building and 
each choosing a machine with prac- 
ticed familiarity. 

Still led by curiosity, Owen walk- 
ed perhaps a hundred feet along tiie 
most convenient aisle and stopped 
again. After a moment he bellowed 
aloud. 

“Hey! What the hell is going on 
here? Anybody home?** The far 
leaches of the building echoed his 
diout. 

The soulless factory workers did 
not pause in their tasks, did not 
look up or even peek around at 
him, did not cover their ears as his 
hoarse bellow beat around the great 
building. Owen considered yelling 
fire! 

The yell was unnecessary; he 
caught a sudden flash of pink in the 
<fistance and concentrated on that. 
Someone had heard him. Another 
one of those pink women came 
along the aisle on the run, panting 
from the unusual exertion. 

*Who did that?^ 

**Who did what?” 

“What is the matter here! Why 
(fid you raise your voice?” 



Owen inspected her. This newest 
specimen was a distinct disappoint- 
ment and he didn’t try to conceal 
that fact. She was a much older 
woman than any he had seen thus 
far: gray haired, gray eyed, gray 
skinned, singularly straight up and 
down, and utterly without a sense 
of humor. 

“We don’t raise our voices in 
here, man.” Her enunciation of man 
contained a built-in gibe. 

“Grandma, except for you and 
me, nobody has voices in here,” he 
retorted. 

That brought a titanic frown to 
the gray forehead. She opened her 
palm as if to slap him but changed 
her mind as the hand was traveling 
toward him. Instead, she quickly 
flipped open his pocket flap and 
jabbed an angry thumb down on his 
identification bar. The gray lips 
curled. 

‘T might have known it. A brand 
new one. Didn’t they teach you 
manners?” 

“What arc manners?” Owen ask- 
ed with secret delight. 

Grandmother managed a double 
take. She snapped at Owen. “Who 
was your fabricator?” 

“Do you mean that crazy doll 
who kicked me out of the house? 
She didn’t introduce herself. Hit- 
ting the jug, you know. One of those 
women who booze up and then 
want to fight.” Owen clucked with 
disapprobation. “But don’t worry, 
Granny, Fve got miother date for 
tonight.” 

“I should hope so,” tiie gray 
lady retorted. “Now behave your- 
•eif and come with me.” 



THE RBCX>N MAN

followed the woman to an 
unmanned machine. In four 
minutes time she introduced him to 
the production line, and it was the 
most confounding thing he’s ever 
seen. 

The machine itself was a mon- 
strous affair the size of an over- 
land truck. Almost all of its work- 
ing parts were concealed from view 
behind a casing, hiding the wheels 
and gears from curious eyes but at 
the same time preventing him or 
those mindless operators from stick- 
ing their fingers into the works. The 
nearby face of the machine contain- 
ed a window perhaps two square 
feet in area, with a short stainless 
steel bar above the window and a 
row of push buttons beneath. The 
bar was about five inches wide and 
two inches high, of concave design, 
and set into the machine wall at 
about the height of a man’s head. 

Owen discovered it was intended 
to receive a man’s forehead. 

Following the gray dame’s ex- 
plicit instructions he bellied up to 
the machine, placed his forehead 
against the bar and visualized a slice 
of bacon. 

He just stood there and thought 
about a slice of bacon. When he 
had formed a complete image in his 
mind, the full, rounded picture of a 
succulent strip of bacon fairly ooz- 
ing with vitamins and goodness, he 
pushed the first button as he had 
been told to do and the machine 
began operating. A light went on 
behind the window. 

A strip of bacon — the one he had 
visualized — dropped from some- 
where overhead onto a paper tray. 



Owen stepped back to stare at it 
“Well, how about that!” 

“Continue!” the gray grandmoth- 
erly type snapped in his ear. “Yon 
haven’t completed the ration. Fol- 
low my instructions.” 

“Say, that’s a damned good trick. 
How’d I do it?” 

“It is reconstituted pork. Com- 
plete the ration.” 

Again he bellied up to the ma- 
chine, placed his head against ths 
think-bar, pressed the button and 
produced a second slice of bacon. II 
dropped down to rest on the tray 
alongside the first slice. Owen kept 
at it until he had five slices in all. 

“That is sufficient. Now wrap 
it.” > 

Punching the second button with 
a feeling of secret exhilaration, 
Owen watched through the window 
as a sheet of transparent wrapping 
paper spewed up from below, wrap- 
ped itself around the rasher of 
bacon with an assist from a pair of 
mechanical fingers and tidied up 
the package for somebody’s break- 
fast. 

“Dispatch it.” 

He punched the third button and 
the package was whisked out of 
sight. An empty tray dropped into 
place and the machine waited for 
the young creator’s next visualiza- 
tion. 

“Neat — very neat. I didn’t even 
say shazamr 

“Stop that noise. Talking isn't 
permitted here. Continue working 
until the shift has ended.” 

“You mean this is all I have to 
do?” 

“Isn’t that enough?” 

IP 




“Well, I guess so,” he said. 

“Then get at it. And keep your 
mouth shut.” She watched over his 
Mulder for the next several min- 
utes, making certain he did a com- 
petent job. 

O wen thought bacon, made ba- 
con, wrapped bacon and sent 
bacon on its way to some myster- 
ious place, five slices to the pack- 
age. 

All of his bacon was of the finest 
quality, prime meat, because it sud- 
denly occurred to him that one of 
those packages might be his break- 
fast in the morning, and he would 
surely be hungry if the charming 
pink and blonde creature lived up 
to her enigmatic promise. 

After a while the gray haired 
supervisor seemed satisfied with his 
output and left him, disappearing 
into the vast distance from which 
she had come. The production of 
bacon went on for nearly an hour. 
And then Owen made a necktie. 

It wasn’t a very good necktie. The 
colors were poor and the pattern 
awry, but it was his very first neck- 
tic and he was proud of it. He 
wondered if perhaps he could create 
a fad for neckties, something to re- 
Meve the dun monotony of the cov- 
eralls. He made several neckties, 
each an improvement on the one 
before, wrapping each one in an in- 
dividual gift package and sending 
them on their way. 

Next he tried a loaf of bread but 
it was a dismal failure and had to 
be scrubbed — his visualization of 
ttie interior had been faulty. A 
handful of cigars pame out better. 



They looked so good he wished he 
could reach through die window and 
help himself. Then it occurred to 
him that a fine monkey wrench 
might please somebody, so he vis- 
ualized that, wrapped it and sent it 
along to wherever the things were 
going. 

Other tools followed, sometimes 
one to a package and sometimes 
several just for variety: screwdriv- 
ers, pliers, ball peen hammers, 
chisels, awls, saws, squares, files, 
everything a journeyman carpenter 
would want in his toolbox. The 
quality and abundance of his tools 
provoked a mild wonder. They were 
so well made, so meticulous in de- 
tail, so workmanlike. Perhaps he had 
been a carpenter before. 

Before what? 

Before he had ceased being twen- 
ty-eight. Before that fuzzy image of 
a moving automobile. 

O wen stopped work to think 
about that. 

Scrawny wisps of memory skitter- 
ed about the barren places of his 
mind. Sometimes two or three wisps 
touched and thereafter clung to- 
gether. 

He had been sitting in an auto- 
mobile. Sitting in the front seat. 
The automobile was moving very 
fast, almost too fast, hurtling along 
a road at breakneck speed. Perhaps 
he had been rushing to his carpen- 
ter’s job. Something happened next. 
Something very big happened. 

Another shadowy image. The im- 
age crawled out of a worm hole at 
the bottom of his mind and crept 
forward to be examined. It touched 

W 



me RECON AUN 




another image. A large truck. There 
was a large truck on the same road 
and it was moving toward him. To- 
ward his automobile. 

Owen stepped back and stared up 
at his machine. 

The machine was as big as a 
truck; when he used his imagination 
it was the size and shape of a large 
truck — that other truck which had 
appeared in front of his car. 

There it was! He had been sitting 
in the front seat of his own automo- 
bile, hurrying along a road, and a 
truck had rushed at him from no- 
where. Well, the truck might have 
been there all the time but he hadn’t 
been looking at it, hadn’t seen it. 
He remembered a toolbox resting 
on the seat beside him. Suddenly the 
box was open and tools were flying 
through the windshield. Some of 
them were even hitting him. His 
automobile stopped quite suddenly. 

Owen was very certain, now, what 
happened to him. 

The speeding car, the unexpect- 
ed truck, the hurtling tools were 
too vivid, too substantial to be dis- 
missed. That had happened to him. 

Owen blinked at the unexpected 
mildness of that and wondered 
briefly why the experience hadn’t 
followed the book. There had been 
no sharp division, no definite period 
of transition between the tools 
striking him and that drunken wom- 
an thumping him on the back as 
she shoved him through a door. The 
one blow had followed the others 
without meaningful separation. No 
rest period. 

Movement in the corner of his 
eye. Owen hastily returned to his 



machine when he caught a glimpse 
of the supervisor coming along the 
aisle. 

Pink clothing was like a neon 
signboard in such drab surround- 
ings. The gray woman paused for 
a sullen moment and looked over 
his shoulder while he dutifully 
manufactured packages of bacon; 
rich, tasty bacon. 

When she continued on her way, 
Owen made a cucumber. He was 
fond of cucumbers. 

IV 

H e was surprised at the short- 
ness of the work day; it had 
union hours beat handily. 

Owen guessed it wasn’t much be- 
yond noon when the gray haired 
supervisor blew a piercing blast on 
a whistle and stopped the works. 
The shrill noise careened around the 
building. He was the only one to 
cover his ears. The lifeless creatures 
manning the machines trooped to 
the great door and departed, exhib- 
iting neither surprise nor regret; 
they mounted the road, which was 
now rolling in the opposite direc- 
tion, and rode away without emo- 
tion. 

Owen followed them in like man- 
ner because the old gray eyes were 
watching him with frustration and 
suspicion. She seemed upset about 
something. Owen conquered a sud- 
den impulse to turn around and 
waggle his fingers at her — she 
might see well enough to note where 
he held his thumb. 

His return trip was uneventful. 
The old cemetery was dismissed

with a casual glance because H no 
longer seemed important to him. He 
was preoccupied with a belated 
realization that no one at the fac- 
tory, including himself, had made a 
trip to the drinking fountain or the 
men’s room all morning long. That 
was decidedly odd. 

The little metal card in his pocket 
bore the pink blonde’s door number. 
Owen fished it out to read it again. 
He began watching doors. The num- 
bers dwindled as the road carried 
him to the southwest He found the 
proper dwelling after a while and 
swung off the road, looking over his 
shoulder to see if anyone was 
watching him. 

They weren’t — they were busy 
seeking their doors. 

. Owen walked up the path and 
tried the door but k did not give 
under his hand. He put more 
strength into a second attempt but 
stffl it held fast. So he kicked the 
door open. 

The apartment reminded him of 
Ae factory, but on a smaller scale 
ei course. It consisted of one long 
room, having a number of opaque 
screens and other room dividers set 
here and there to break the vast, 
monotonous expanse of the whole. 
There were no pictures, no carpets, 
no useless dustcatchers. He located 
a lounging area, a dining area, a 
vaguely feminine place which would 
be the blonde’s bedroom (double 
bed), a cubbyhole alongside it 
which served as a bath and another, 
smaller cubbyhole which contained 
a single stainless steel cot and noth- 
ing more. Owen stared at the cot 
and shuddered. 



The remainder of the apartment 
was a workshop, and here the sug- 
gestion of a factory was too broad 
to be ignored. The dominating 
structure in the room was the think 
and do machine — a scaled-down 
replica of that same machine he had 
used this morning to manufacture 
bacon. The only otfier discemable 
difference to this machine was that 
It contained a delivery door on one 
side, an opening exactly resembling 
an oven door. Owen pulled it open 
to peer inside. The oven was empty 
but for a smidgin of dust and an 
odor which caused him to wrinkle 
his nose and quickly close the door. 

Three oblong boxes were stacked 
at the rear of the machine. Because 
he was nosy, Owen lifted the lid of 
the topmost box and looked inside. 
He closed it fast. 

A worn book caught his eye and 
he picked it up to riffle the pages. 
Owen guessed it to be a service 
manual. Several of the large inner 
pages folded out to resemble blue- 
prints or schematic drawings or 
something. The text of the manual 
was written in a peculiar kind of 
English he failed to understand, but 
the illustrations were remarkably 
clear and comprehensible. They de- 
picted men. 

Owen slammed shut the book, 
suddenly ill at ease. He did not 
like to look at skeletons and at livid, 
man-like things with their skins off. 
It was indecent. 

O wen found a jar of old coins 
tucked away in a corner of the 
workshop and was twisting off the 
lid when he heard a noise at the 



WE RfiCOH A4AN 



n 




door. He put down the jar and went 
to investigate. The blonde had come 
home. 

He said, “Nice little place you’ve 
got here.” 

The blonde was staring at the 
shattered remains of her door. Her 
surprise on seeing him was equal 
to the dismay caused by the wreck- 
age. 

“What are you doing here?’’ 
“Unfair! Unfair! You invited me 
— now don’t try to wriggle out of 
it.” 

“What happened to this door?” 

“I kicked it open.” 

“But why did you do that?” 
“Because it was locked,” Owen 
said simply. 

A sharp, penetrating frown. “Are 
you looped?” 

“Not yet. I couldn’t find any- 
thing in the house.” 

“Why did you leave your job?” 
“The old woman — you know. 
Granny — stopped the works. She 
sent us home.” 

“Why?” 

“I didn’t ask. I’m not a company 
man.” 

“Was there a breakdown?” 

“I didn’t see any.” 

“That is very unusual. Something 
must have gone wrong.” 

“Too bad,” Owen said. “I liked 
the hours, too.” 

She looked past him into the in- 
terior of the house. “What were 
you doing in there?” 

“Casing the joint. It’s a square 
layout.” 

“It isn’t square, it’s a trapezoid. 
Our buildings are planned.” 

Owen shook his head. “Honey, 



do you have any idea what a dumb 
broad is? The slightest idea?” 

“No.” 

“I didn’t think so.” He waved her 
forward. “You might as well hop 
over that kindling and come on in. 
You stand out there yakking all 
day, people will think you’re sell- 
ing subscriptions or something.” 

The blonde stepped over the 
wreckage of her door and enter- 
ed the apartment in, something 
of a daze. “I confess I don’t under- 
stand you at all. You are unlike 
any other man I have ever known. 
You are incomprehensible.” 

“That makes two of us,” he re- 
torted. “What did you do with In- 
diana?” 

“I never had your Indiana. I 
don’t know what it is.” 

“Indiana was the place I lived 
in, back there, back when. What 
time is it now — I mean, what year 
is it?” 

“One Hundred Sixty-one.” 

“One Hundred and Sixty-one 
ivhat?” 

“What do you mean by what?” 
“There you are!” he shouted 
triumphantly. “What is A. D. or 
something like that.” 

The blonde was bewildered. 
“What is A. D.?” 

Owen muttered, “A rose is a rose 
is a rose.” 

He seized her hand and pulled 
her into the workshop. As before, 
she seemed startled by his unfam- 
iliar action but went along readily 
enough. Owen paused near the 
think and do machine and pointed 
dramatically to the stack of oblong 
crates stacked beside it.

“Poor old Yorick is stuffed in 
there, in that top box. Shame on 
you. 

T here had not been sufficient 
time for the startled expression 
to leave her face. “Do you know 
him?” she asked incredulously. 

“Never saw him before in my 
life. Either of my lives. Do you 
specialize in reconstituted orange 
juice?” Owen stepped close and 
peered into her eyes in what he 
hoped was an accusatory manner. 
“Fve got your number, baby!” 

“Of course you have. I gave it 
to you this morning.” 

“Not that number!” Owen roar- 
ed. “I mean, I know what’s going on

know all about them zombies out 
there. They’re recon jobs!” 

The pretty blonde stared at Owen 
for a long while as the shout died 
away and silence returned to the 
room. At last she said thoughtfully, 
*^You are flawed” Each word was 
given a careful enunciation to make 
it properly significant. 

Owen shifted uncomfortably un- 
der her stare, looked away, took a 
backward step and searched for 
somethiing to distract her attention. 
He felt like an ant under glass. The 
jar of old coins caught his eye and 
his imagination; he’d been about to 
examine them when the blonde 
came home. Now there was a hand- 
ful of clues. Owen darted across the 
shop. He twisted off the lid and 
spilled the coins on a bench. Ap- 
parently she had tried to clean them. 

“Come here — look at these 
things. Where did you get them?” 



The blonde joined him at tho 
bench, watching him carefully. 
“They turn up here and there, dur- 
ing excavations. The ancients used 
them in their religious ceremonies; 
they are called monies.” 

“I know what they are,” he said 
shortly. “Look at the datesl” 

Owen sorted the coins. There was 
a solitary penny, several dimes, a 
couple of quarters, a half dollar, 
and two other coins which -were 
total strangers to his eye. The penny 
was dated 1948 and Owen grunted 
his satisfaction at die familiar date. 
Two of the dimes were of the Mer- 
cury type bearing the dates 1916 
and 1945; the remainder were the 
later Roosevelt dimes and Owen in- 
spected the date of each one with 
a concentrated interest. One dime 
was carefully put aside. The two 
quarters were of minimal interest 
because the dates were common. 
The half dollar was something else 
again and earned a careful scrutiny. 
Owen stared with disfavor at the 
man’s profile stamped on the coin 
and muttered an indistinct vilifica- 
tion; imagine that jackass winding 
up famous! It was put aside with the 
dime. 

He hunched over the remaining, 
unfamiliar pieces. 

“Look at these things,” he com- 
manded the blonde. "Ten Shut. 
What is ten shut? What do you 
know about the AmerCan States? 
Does that mean what I think it 
means?” 

“It is said that AmerCan was a 
most ancient land, supposedly the 
possession of a mythical deity. I 
know nothing more than that.” She

studied his face, anticipating an ex- 
pected ritual. ‘^Do you know about 
it?” 

“Never heard of the fool thing, 
but I can guess. Look here, they 
turned out these pieces in 2073 and 
2109. Boy — talk about Buck Rog- 
ers stuff!” Owen dismissed the 
strange coins and returned his at- 
tention to the dime. He inspected 
it somberly, turned it over to read 
the mint mark and then rolled it 
in his fingers. It had the old feel 
of Indiana, the feel of home. After 
a moment he gave the dime to the 
girl. 

*^Read it.” 

“Read what?” It was not what she 
was expecting. 

“The date.” 

“One nine six zero. Is that signifi- 
cant?” 



“It sure as hell is, honey. 1960. 
That was minted just one year after 
I . after the . you know.” He 
groped f<M- Ae proper expression to 
mark the ev^t. 

“After you ceased being twenty- 
eight?” 

Owen nodded, knowing a melan- 
choly mood. “It gives a guy a funny 
feeling at the bottom of his stomaclL 
I mean, I didn’t get that far, but 
here it is in my hand. The date 
reads funny. It makes a guy think.” 
She asked softly. “Do you want 
me to withdraw?” 

“Withdraw? What for?” 

“You might want to pray private- 
ly.” 

O wen nearly hurled the dime 
across the room. “You don’t 
on it, dimwit, you spend it!” 





“Spend? How do you spend it?” 
“On beer — when you can find 
dime beer.” 

“What is beer?” 

“Booze,” he retorted. 

The blonde brightened. “I know 
that term now. I have discovered 
that Booze was the name of a pre- 
historic god who manufactured alco- 
holic beverages for his people. The 
ancients drank it during their cere- 
monial ' orgies.” 

“We sure as hell did, honey, with 
or without the orgies. And so did 
that crazy dame who had me last 
night. Where did she get the stuff?” 
The young woman revealed her 
frustration. “I don’t know that I 
have not been able to locate your 
fabricator; you haven’t been very 
helpful, you know. But I am cer- 
tain that her unfortunate experi- 



ments with the alcohol was respon- 
sible for your flawed condition. It 
never happened before. There is no 
such thing as a faulted worker. That 
simply can’t be permitted, of 
course.” 

“Of course. So what do we do 
now? Fly kites?” 

The blonde folded her arms. The 
hesitation in answering was notice- 
able. “I admit to a certain curioa- 
ity.” 

“About what?” 

“About you, Owen Hall. The flaw 
may have been deliberate.” 

Owen studied the pink coveralls, 
A lively rubber ball of exhilaration 
snapped up and down his spine. 

“Do you suppose that babe had 
something in mind?” 

“I intend to find out” 

“How?” 



THE RECON MAN 





She only smiled and looked at 
liim. 

“Goody,” Owen said after a mo- 
ment. “I like surprises.” 



O wen Hall woke up at some un- 
known hour of the night. He 
peered around in the darkness, 
seeking orientation, and then turn- 
ed over in bed to gently prod the 
shoulder of the sleeping mechanic. 
The absolute hush of an untenanted 
night enfolded the apartment and 
the city beyond it. Owen knew 
without looking that the road was 
motionless and empty, and the park 
benches — if they existed — would 
be folded away. Perhaps even the 
moon had deserted the earth lest 
its light cause a stirring among 
nightbirds. The silence on the other 
side of the door was total. 

The blonde moved under his 
prodding. “What’s the matter?” she 
asked drowsily. 

“I’m hungry.” 

“Go to sleep. It isn’t time to 



eat. 






“But I’m hungry now,” Owen in- 
sisted. 

She pulled herself awake and sat 
up in bed, obviously annoyed. 
“Can’t you wait until morning?” 

“No,” Owen said and bounced 
out of bed. ‘Tlit the deck.” He 
pulled back the cover. “Chop, 
chop.” 

The young woman climbed out 
with a suspicious word on her lips 
that aroused his wonder. He was 
sure he wouldn’t like it if he un- 
derstood it. She walked on bare 



feet to the kitchen and turned on 
a light. 

Owen said, “Wow,” and looked 
at the view while the blonde snap- 
ped a switch above a stainless steel 
box set into the kitchen wall. An- 
other contraption that reminded 
him of an oven. He watched in sil- 
ence as she sullenly pushed a series 
of btittons below the shiny box 
ordering a meal. Nothing happen 
ed immediately and the blonde lean 
ed against the wall, fighting sleep 
Time slipped away. 

“What’s holding up the show?” 

“Be patient,” she said crossly. 
“It will be cooked and delivered in 
a moment.” 

“Right out of the factory, eh? 
You babes sure have this town or- 
ganized.” 

A signal light winked into sud- 
den brilliance over the wall box and 
the blonde pulled open an oven- 
like door on the front. His break- 
fast was there, steaming hot. 

Owen stared at the monkey 
wrench. The wooden handle was 
done to a crisp. 

The woman was stunned. **What 
is that?” 

“A monkey wrench. What did 
you think it was?” 

S he turned on him, her face cloud- 
ed with the color of anger. 
Despite himself, Owen was en- 
tranced. He couldn’t remember ever 
seeing a woman angry all the way 
down. 

“Look at me!” 

Owen lifted his gaze. “I am.” 
“Tom did that!” 

“Guilty, your honor.”

**That is why the processing plant 
was shut down, that is why you 
were sent home early 

“I thought it was the union 
hours.” 

She shook an excited finger in 
his face. “Do you realize what you’ve 
done? Do you realize people might 
go hungry tomorrow? Did you make 
many of those things?” 

“No,” Owen said truthfully. “Just 
one of them. That one.” 

“You are totally irresponsible!” 
“Aw, calm down. You said that 
before; you’re always yakking about 
my flaws and my equilibrium. Go 
sing a new song.” He inspected the 
smoking handle of the wrench and 
decided he wasn’t hungry after all. 
It wouldn’t be wise to request an- 
other order just now. 

She said omiously, “There will 
be no question about your equili- 
brium in the morning. There will 
be no flaws when you leave here.” 
“Going to rebuild me, eh? A 
complete overhaul?” 



“You will not be flawed v^hen I 
am finished with you.” 

“Thafs what I thought.” Owen 
looked at her symmetrical witchery. 
“Always wanting to take the fun 
out of Bfe, always wanting to knock 
everybody down to size. Honey, 
you’ve got a screwball world here 
and you can damn well keep it. If 
you prefer them zombies out there 
to me, die h^ with’ it.” 

He turned aod stalked out. 
“Where are you going?” 

“I’m going to bed,” he called 
back from the other room. A mo- 
ment later: “I’m in bed. See in 
what peace a Christian can die.” 
The young woman stood in the 
kitchen for a long moment before 
snapping off the switch on the wall 
oven. The light followed, and still 
she waited in the darkness. At 
length she realized her bare feet 
were cold. 

Owen Hall’s single day of life 
^ded better than it had begun.

T he momeoft Bill Wheeler stepped 
into the bathroom, both little 
girls shrieked and leapt out of the 
bath. Bill grabbed for Hannah and 
Iris wife grabbed for Tammy. She 
missed, he connected, but Hannah 
twisted out of hts grasp, left him 
with a hanctfnl of suds, and chased 



the other handful of suds into the 
nursery. 

A moment later they were back 
brandishing sheets of drawing-paper 
covered with bold drawings. 

‘‘Look, Daddy! Look what I drew 
at school!” yelled Tammy. 

“Look, I drew something too!” 
shouted Hannah. 

”Look, look, look, look!" 



78 



Their mother shushed helplessly 
through the steam but Bill just 
laughed. 

‘‘Look, Daddy, stop laughing 
Daddy. Look at our pictures.” 

“All right, already,” he said. 
"Now one at a time, for Heaven’s 
sake. Get in a line, why don’t you?” 

“They’ll get in the bath again if 
anywhere,” said Mrs. Wheeler, and 
firmly lifted Hannah — the nearest 
and smallest — over the rim, her 
pink sudsy legs kicking in the air. 

“Well, you seem to have your feet 
on the ground,” he said to his other 
daughter. 

“Oh, come on, Daddy,” she an- 
swered. and thrust the drawing to- 
wards him. 

He took it from her, and, prolong- 
ing the suspense, slowly fetched 
from his inside pocket a leather case 
from which he took his lenses and 
fixed them deliberately on his nose. 
Meanwhile Hannah was energetical- 
ly resisting her mother’s efforts to 
soap her arms and was beating the 
back of her father’s neck with a roll 
of drawing paper. Mrs. Wheeler 
acted like a wise mother, and whip- 
ped the roll of paper out of one 
daughter’s hand and wrapped the 
other in a shroud-sized towel. 

“Let’s keep it a little quiet,” said 
Bill. “I ’m concentrating on Tammy’s 
picture.” There was a comparative 
silence, broken only by a suppressed 
whinnying from the two girls. 

“Now let’s see. Right in the front, 
bigger than everything else, there’s 
a man with a fur round his neck — ” 

“That’s not fur. Daddy,” said 
Tammy from inside the towel. 
"That’s a beard.” 



“And he seems to be wearing a 
sort of yachting jacket covered with 
bottle tops.” 

“Silly, Daddy! That’s his Space 
Police uniform with his rows and 
rows of medals.” 

“Oh, yes. Well, behind him a 
piece there’s this space cruiser on its 
hind legs, there’s a couple more 
people in yachting jackets — ” 

“Oh, Daddyr 

“ — round a little fire, and then 
there’s trees and flowers and so on 
and a monster artichoke — ” 

“It’s a Murray person. Daddy. A 
Murray person.” 

“I see now by the warts. And 
then there’s more trees very small 
in the background, and after that 
there’s a little, little man walking 
away into the distance.” 

“Now look at mine! Now look at 
mine!” came a shout out of the 
steam in the bath, and Hannah pura- 
meled at her mother’s arm. 

i4T)ut that somewhere safe for 
JL me,” said Bill to his elder 
daughter, handing her back her 
drawing. “I must look at Hannah’s.” 
From the window-sill he picked up 
the other drawing and opened it. 
“Remarkable unanimity of theme, 
I see,” he said. “There’s this big 
man with a beard in the front and 
then halfway back the other two 
medium-sized men by the fire and 
the warty artichoke — ” 

“Murray person!” screamed Han- 
nah, incensed, from the bath. 

“And then the line of trees and 
then the little man in the distance.” 
“Come on, Daddyl Guess what it 
represents. Daddy!”

“I really can’t think,” said their 
father in mock mystificatiofi. 
‘^Something you read about hi 
school?” 

“You’re being so stupid, Daddy,” 
said Hannah. Tammy released her- 
self from the towel and wound it 
instead round her father’s legs. 

“Daddy really knows,” she said 
scornfully. “He’s just pretending.” 

“I don’t know,” said Bill. 

“It’s you on the Federation sat- 
ellite, Daddy. Don’t you see?” sidd 
Hannah eagerly. “There’s you in 
the front with the medals, and be- 
hind’s Levine and Matsuki and right 
in the back’s the c^d man getting 
smaller and smaller. “Don’t you 
see?” 

“Well, now you mention it. I do 
see Levine and Matsuki and I just 
see the o!kl man, though he’s got a 
bit small in this picture. But 1 don’t 
see me. Unless you mean this beard- 
ed monkey up front here — but he’s 
nothing Ifte me.” 

“You’re so sffly sometimes. Dad- 
dy,” said Tammy. “Of course it’s 
you in tbc picture.” 

“I guess they’ve finished their 
bath,” said BiU’s wife. 

“Time for our story! Time for 
our story!” 

“Okay, so let’s be off,” said Bill. 
He waited for the resolution of an 
unequeal three-way struggle be- 
tween Hannah and her mother and 
Hannah’s flowered nightshirt and 
then they were ready. Bill snatched 
his two diildren up into his arms, 
from which point they instantly 
started tugging at his reddish beard. 

“Easy on the steering,” he said 
and swept them through into die 



nursery, where he inserted one into 
die b^ with the elephants on the 
quih and the other into the bed widi 
die lions on the quilt. They popped 
straight out again like corks from 
a champagne bottle and, bouncii^ 
round him, changed beds. He bared 
his teeth and hooded his eyes Satan- 
kaQy. “Drat it,” he said. “Where 
did I put those children?” 

“Wrong beds,” said Hanmdi, 
snugging down into the covers unti 
only her curly topknot showed. 

“Now tell us the story of you and 
Levine and Matsuko on the Federa- 
tkm satellite.” 

“You don’t want that old story 
again? I’ve told it to you a dozen 
times. And it’s sort of sad.” 

“The Federation satellite! The 
Federation satellite!” 

“Don’t you want the one about 
the witch, the wolves and the little 
girl who Hved on Endymion IV?” 
“You and the Federation satd- 
litel” 

“The Federation satellite it is 
then. Ready now. It was like this.” 
He stopped. Hannah’s topknot had 
disappeared and he could see nothing 
of her except a bulge under the 
bedclothes like a goat in the stoma<® 
of a boa constrictor. “Did I lose 
you?” he asked. “Oh, I see. Ten! 
Nine! Sight! Seven! SixIFive! Fourl 
Three! Two! — um — urn — One! 
Fire all!” 

With a whining and a spluttering 
Hannah emerged from her boa con- 
strictor and sat up straight with her 
arms above her head, grinning and 
giggling. 

“All ^ipshape now? Well, I’ll 
begin.”

II 

4CT>ackaways in the dim past be- 

AJ fore you two nonsenses were 
thought of, (he said), a ship set out 
from Glenn Field, New Mexico, 
carrying three men, a Murray and 
just a heap of papers and pictures. 
The first man was Levine, Earth’s 
ambassador to the Galactic Federa- 
tion; the second was Matsuki, a 
captain in the Space Police; and the 
third man was his engineer, as 
stupid, lazy and bearded a man as 
you could hope to meet. Til not tell 
you his name. 

(“Daddy!” shouted Tammy and 
Hannah together.) 

Don’t interrupt. Their mission was 
to deliver Levine and his heap of 
papers and pictures to a meeting- 
place where he would talk to people 
from the Federation. Levine was 
going to do the talking; the Murray, 
as you know, just keeps the artificial 
gravity going; the engineer was to 
run the ship and Matsuki was there 
sort of to run the Murray and the 
engineer. So when the ship got to 
the meeting-place they found the 
Federation hadn’t arrived. But they’d 
left a biggish disk-island floating 
there — luckily the right way up or 
we’d all have slipped off. And they’d 
left a signal beacon which guided 
the ship in to land. The signal 
beacon also said they should wait 
there, the Federation people would 
be along in about four Earth days. 
The engineer looked through a port- 
hole and everything looked okay; 
he opened the ventilator and the air 
sniffed okay. So everybody got out 
and took a walk. 



Well, you kids these days know as 
much about the Federation as I do, 
but I’ll just say that in those days 
we knew pretty little about them. Wo 
sort of suspected they were good 
eggs, but it was Levine’s job to find 
out exactly how good. Very brave 
man, Levine. 

So anyway, everybody got out. 
The ship had landed in what looked 
like a clearing in a wood. Around 
them were trees and shrubs of all 
Earth varieties — more like the Bo- 
tanical Gardens, reaHy, than a nat- 
ural wood. And between the trees 
were scattered irregular beds of veg- 
etables and flowers. Some of them 
looked recently dug over. To be 
exact about the vegetables, there 
were beds of tomatoes, beds of car- 
rots, beds of onions, beds of celery 
and beds of lettuce. Since there were 
also apple trees, peach trees, lemon 
trees, grapefruit trees, mulberry 
trees and grape vines the three men 
made themselves a delicious fresh 
salad like the one you had tonight. 
This, I may say, they were very 
glad and very lucky to get after 
weeks in space. 

(He looked sternly at the chil- 
dren. Tammy giggled guiltily. Han- 
nah squirmed and giggled.) 

So the sun was still high and they 
decided to see what the rest of the 
country was like. They left the ship 
on automatic and set off along what 
might have been a path through the 
trees. The land sloped upwards, very 
slightly at first, then more steeply, 
so that finally they came to a nearly- 
vertical rampart or ridge about ten 
feet high which curved inwards 
round them on both sides. Along 



VANISHING POINT 



t1 




the top of it grew a line of fir trees. 
They scrambled up the ridge and 
found themselves looking down on 
a flat and level plain that dipped 
away before them. 

^ “1 guess this is an old volcano 

crater,” said Matsuki, who (as a 
good captain) liked to make classifi- 
cations as firm as possible. 

**Or maybe an old meteor crater?” 
said Levine, who (as a good diplo- 
mat) liked his classifications fluid. 

‘T guess so,” said the engineer, 
who (as a good engineer) was stu- 
pid. 

Beyond the ring of trees they 
could see countryside much like the 
area within the saucer — a pizza of 
flowers and vegetable patches, pep- 
pered with fruit trees. In some 
places the engineer thought he could 
discern paths through the trees, but 
they were so scattered and irregular 
that they might have been skeins of 
last year’s leaves piled up by the 
wind between the trees. The sun 
was bright overhead; the light breeze 
was fresh and dry; the metal of the 
ship glinted sharply behind them 
across the grove. But the air in the 
plain beyond was misty and moist, 
and the horizon was lost in a faint 
blue haze which hid anything fur- 
ther than about five miles out. The 
engineer, with his marvellously sharp 
eyes, was the first to see the figure 
who is the strange hero of this 
story. 

(“The old mani The old man!” 
shouted the children delightedly.) 

T he old man. This rugged figure 
was climbing slowly through 
the trees up the rim of the glade in 



which the Earthmen stood. He was 
dressed in baggy old blue denim 
pants and a patched tartan shirt. In 
one hand he carried a knobbly 
beechwood staff, in the other a bun- 
dle. The engineer nudged the other 
two Earthmen and together they 
stood up under the pines along the 
perimeter of the glade and waved 
and shouted to the old man. He un- 
twisted himself as reluctantly as a 
100-year old apple tree and raised 
his^ stick in greeting. 

“I’ll be along presently,” he called 
up to them. “Just you wait where 
you are.” 

A few moments later the old man 
reached the top of the rise with a 
considerable puffing and blowing. 

(“And spitting. Daddy,” said 
Hannah. “You forgot the spitting.” 
And she gave a vigorous imitation 
of what she meant. 

“Well, yes. That’s true. He was 
spitting a bit, too. But that’s no rea- 
son for you to.” Bill fell silent for 
a moment, and cleared his throat. 
Hannah culminated her display in a 
paroxysm of sniffing and hissing, 
then settled back on her pillow 
grinning. “Well, when he got to the 
top, he held out his hand to Levine 
and said — ” 

“ ‘Welcome to the Federation, 
sir. My name’s Gardner. Make your- 
self at home, sir, you and your 
company. Fll do what I can to make 
you comfortable, but don’t ask no 
questions, I just work here,’ ” said 
Tammy all in one breath. 

“That’s right. Then he laid his 
bundle on the ground and unwrap- 
ped a striped flannel rag and fetch- 
ed out the carcass of a fat hare.’O

“I trapped this out in the blue- 
berry patch isi the valley. I was busy 
with my traps and I didn’t see you

almost. I’d better hurry and make 
your fire or he won’t be done by 
dinner time.” 

“Well, I’m sure that’s most kind 
ot you, Mr. Gardner,” siid Levine. 
'But I don’t think we lijcd a fire. 
We’ve got a small stove built into 
the extension heat-engine of our 
ship.” 

“It’ll be all the better done over 
wood, sir. And you’ll need a little 
fire of an evening.” 

“Well, that’s most hospitable.” 
“Now I hope you’ve everything 
you want. There’s a spring for 
w^ater to the south of your ship 
about 20 yards. You can tell which 
is south by the sun. I thought of 
making the fire between there and 
the ship. You’ll see there’s a couple 
of fallen trees there’ll make com- 
fortable seating, I think.” 

“Sounds like a holiday!” said 
Matsuki, rolling up his sleeves and 
taking deep breaths of the pine- 
scented air. 

“1 certainly hope it will be one, 
sir,” said Gardner. “I’m going over 
now to make up your fire. Why 
don’t you look around? I’m afraid 
I have to ask you not to go further 
out than the ridge around this dip 
here Beyond there I’m not suppos- 
ed to take you. And you’d need a 
gukle.” 

Levine said, “Ya, sure. We’ll just 
v.alk around for now.” 

When they got back to the ship 
they found the (Ad man had picked 
a camp site for them. He was sitting 



on a fallen log stirring a pot which 
hung on a tripod of sticks over a 
crackling fire. They crowded round 
the pot. 

“Smells good,” said Matsuki, 
rudely dipping his finger in. “Tastes 
good, too.” 

“It’s the hare, sir,” said the old 
man. “As a matter of fact I added 
to it some juice I made last year. 
You take grapes, and squeeze them, 
and if you let them ferment — ” 

“That’s a remarkable process,” 
said the engineer. “Perhaps you 
could patent it.” 

“ ‘Patent?’ 1 don’t know the word, 
sir.” 

“Never mind,” said Matsuko, who 
was a gluttonous eater. “What say 
we eat? Eh?” He looked round the 
group, his eyes pleading. 

So the engineer was sent to get 
the plates and they sat down round 
the fire and helped themselves from 
the pot. 

B y the time they had finished the 
sun had gone down. The old 
man collected their plates and they 
heard him rinse them in the spring 
in the darkness beyond the fire. 
When he came back he was carrying 
an earthenware jar corked at the 
neck. 

“I Ve got some more of that juice 
I spoke of,” he said. “Would you 
like some to drink after dinner?” 
“You bet,” said Matsuki and 
ambled to the ship and brought 
mugs. 

The old man uncorked the bottle. 
For a long time the four men sat 
around the little fire in a silence 
broken only by the sounds of the 



84 



IF 




engineer’s gurgling pipe, and of Mat- 
suki smacking his lips and of 
▼ine’^ restless pencD. 

“What are you doing?” asked the 
old man. 

“I’m drawing,” said Levine. “I 
do it when I’ve nothing else to do.” 
“Can I look, please?” 

“Of course. Come and sit over 
here.” 

The old man moved round and 
the engineer made a place for him. 
“I see,” he said. “But that’s mar- 
velous. You’re making a picture of 
us. There’s the cooking pot very 
big in front and beyond with the 
light on half his face, is Captain 
Matsuki picking his teeth. That’s 
marvelous. Coidd you draw me?” 
“Of course. Sit opposite me where 
I can see you without the light in 
my eyes.” 

The old man went over where he 
pointed. He tore out the sheet he’d 
been working on and selected a long 
stick of charcoal. The old man 
watched his hands in fascination. 
Levine began to draw. 

“Who are you, Mr. Gardner? 
How did you get here? Are you 
human?” 

“Oh yes, sir,” said the old man 
proudly. “I’m human all right. I 
know why you ask. I’ve seen some 
clever robots. But my parents were 
human all right, servants to colon- 
ists on Stoneground.” 

Levine grunted. “There haven’t 
been colonists on Stoneground since 
the Damp hit the planet 60 years 
ago. It’s pretty far from Earth’s 
other colonies, you know.” 

The old man didn’t answer for a 
while. He was watching Levkie^s 



careful movements. Following his 
gaze, the engineer realized that Le- 
vine was drawing much slower than 
usual, though the old man couldn’t 
know that. The old man’s attention 
was on Levine’s drawing, but Le- 
vine’s was on the old man’s words. 

“Oh, yes, the Damp got my. par- 
ents, and my parents’ master and 
mistress. But I was in a Jdddy-cabin 
the master and mistress had used 
for their own children and passed 
on to my parents. So when the Damp 
came I escaped.” 

“That’s funny.” 

“Why, sir?” 

“Well, the police sent out a cen- 
sus force after the Damp passed on. 
They traced every single colonist 
who’d been noted in the census be- 
fore. And buried them, too. I re- 
member reading an abstract of the 
report. Even when colonies have to 
be written off we have to find out 
what happened. I’m sorry if this u 
painful, but it’s important to Earth 
what happens to Barthmen.” 

“I’m not hurt. It’s *o long ago 
now. I’m proud you ^ould inquire, 
sir. The truth is I was bom after die 
last census of the living planet and 
then the Damp came. They never 
knew I existed.” 

“I see. Well, what happened 
then?” 

“It’s simple, really. When the 
Federation spotted die Damp on 
Stoneground they sent a fumigation 
team in right away. Now that you 
know about the Damp I expect you 
do the same.” 

“Yes, we do.” 

“You see Stoneground’s one of 
Earth’s farthest colonies. Well, it’s 

V 



VANISHINO POiHT 




also OD the outskirts ot the Federa- 
tion territory.” 

“1 suppose it is, yes." 

"I was the first human being the 
Federation ever met, so they tell me. 
I was eight years old. Well, they 
began to study my environment at 
once — fetched a whole farmhouse 
and everything in it from Stone- 
ground and installed it on one of 
their planets, and brought along an 
old rancher and his wife from 
Stoneground’s neighbor Bullrush. 
They were my stepfather and moth- 
er, old Mr. and Mrs. Gardner of 
Bullrush. They died years ago. I”m 
lucky to be alive myself." 

"TTiat’s a strange story. How did 
you get here?” 

‘‘They put me here as curator. 
This is Earth-Heaven, the Federa- 
tion’s gift to Earth. They feel you 
should have somewhere in this sec- 
tor you can call home.” 

“It’s certainly like Earth, It’s a 
wonderful job.” 

“I believe it is. But it’s only a 
mock-up. Very beautiful, of course, 
but it’s not Earth.” 

“I guess not, Gardner, Home’s al- 
ways something special.” 

“I wish one day I could go to 
your home, Man’s home. I’d like to 
see i^ once. I hope you don’t mind 
me mentioning that? I’d so like to 
go in a ship back to Earth.” 

The old man gazed into the fire. 
Levine glanced at Matsuki and Mat- 
suki looked questioningly at the 
engineer. When the engineer felt 
their eyes on him he shrugged his 
shoulders. “There’s room” he said, 
“Why shouldn’t there be enough 
room for one more?” 



m 

M atsuki had been lying all after- 
noon in the long grass just be- 
low the boundary ridge of the en- 
campment. Now he came strolling 
back towards the ship and found 
the others drinking mugs of tea. 
“How on Earth — ?” he asked. 
“It’s not perhaps quite what 
you’re used to, sir,” said Gardner, 
who was bustling around filling the 
mugs. “I did what 1 could with the 
local product. 1 found a bush down 
in the valley and I took the liberty 
of picking some myself last year 
and drying it in the sun.” 

“You know, this is some climate. 
Old Gardner gets us tea. And while 
1 was lying out there I saw a couple 
of flights of duck, Striped and Pek- 
ing, and pigeons and even a swan. 
I haven’t eaten swan since once in 
Normandy, there was a little place 
... It hurts to remember those days. 
I wish we had a little gun, I really 
do.” 

“It’s more than my job’s worth, 
Matsuki,” said Levine. “Not even 
one small atomic cannon.” 

Silently the engineer handed Mat- 
suki a forked stick he’d been whit- 
tling. “I think this may serve. If you 
ask Levine pleasantly, he might open 
his briefcase and give you a few of 
the government’s rubberbands. And 
even some paper clips as bullet.” 
“Hey, that’s not a bad idea. But 
pebbles would make heavier bullets. 
What about it, Ambassador? You 
wouldn’t lose your job over a few 
rubberbands?” 

“I guess not. I’ll get you some 
after tea.” Levine settled back to

his drawing. He only knew how to 
draw two ways. Sometimes he would 
draw things around him at that mo- 
ment; sometimes he would draw his 
wife. She was a cheerful, dumpy 
woman and they had several cheer- 
ful, dark-eyed children. 

Gardner roasted hedgehogs in 
clay for dinner that night. 

The next day Matsuki frightened 
several pigeons and bruised a wood- 
cock. Levine drew his wife as a tall 
blonde, since his imagination ran 
away with him when he was away 
from home. The engineer made Mat- 
guki a crossbow with a telescopic 
sight out of some pieces of an opti- 
cal scanner, a tunic-hanger and three 
Space Police belts. 

Gardner charcoal-grilled a brace 
of pheasants and washed Levine’s 
white shirts. 

T he next day was a bit different. 

It happens that this engineer 
was a light sleeper. Like his young- 
est daughter — but not like his wife 
and his lazybones elder daughter. 
(Tammy squirmed protestingly.) 
Anyway, he awoke the next morn- 
ing around 5 a.m. or 5:30. Mist 
hung among the trees in the glade; 
the shadows of the trunks slanted 
through it making a network of 
biue bars. The rail of the ^ship’s 
ladder was damp with the morning 
dew and, running his hand along it, 
he swept up a stream of water. Be- 
low him the old man was poking 
around the campfire. A thin trickle 
of smoke wavered up towards the 
tree tops. 

"Hullo, Gardner. How are you 
tibis morning?” asked the engineer, 



belting his woollen robe around him. 

"Good morning, Mr. Wheeler, 
sir,” said the old man. "I’m just 
finishing your fire. Then I’ll be off 
and maybe find some eggs for break- 
fast. That would suit, I hope?” 

"Excellent. I’ll come with you.” 

"Well, to be "honest, sir. I’d rather 
you didn’t, if you don’t mind me 
saying so, sir. The chidcens usutdfy 
lay in the raspberry bramble tlmt 
I have, and that^ out. beyond fiie 
perimeter.” 

"Come on, then. I’ll come widi 
you to the edge of the grove.” 

"Well, thafs all right.” 

The two set off together, the dd 
man switching away fiercely at net- 
tles and ragwort in the grass, plants 
that hurt his professional pride. The 
young engineer watched him curious- 
ly. 

"Why can’t I go outside the 
glade?” 

"It’s not ‘can’t’, sir, if you under- 
stand me. It’s just sort of this part 
has been laid out for your party and 
in a way the rest hasn’t. I’ll show 
you what I mean when we get 
there.” 

In a few minutes they got up onto 
the rampart under the pines and 
stopped. "Fm going over there,” 
said Gardner, pointing to a green 
patch about half a mile away. 
"That’s the raspberry patch. But I 
doubt you could make it out there. 
You’d get lost. Walk a few yards 
and you’ll see what I mean.” 

The engineer smiled at the old 
man’s distrust of his sense of direc- 
tion and stepped out amiably down 
the slope with him. Immediately he 
sensed that the air outside the bowl

was entirely different from that 
above. It must be as steamy as a 
jungle, was his first thought. He 
could hardly see the old man ahead 
of him, and the tops of the low fruit 
trees were lost in the swirling mist. 
He went forward uncertainly, trip- 
ped on the uneven ground. 

When he looked up there was 
nothing to be seen anywhere. 

He was surrounded by an even 
glow which cut him off from his 
surroundings as surely as if he had 
been sitting in a light globe. If this 
was mist, it was the thicket — and 
dryest — he’d ever been in. 

“Hey, Gardnerl” he shouted. 
“Get me out of this.” 

XTothing happened. He experi- 
mented by putting his hand 
close to his face. When he held it 
a couple of inches from his eyes 
it was just visible as a dark shadow. 
Not only could he see nothing, but 
he discovered with a start that he 
could hear nothing except the beat 
of his own heart and a hiss that 
could as easily have been in his ears 
as in the trees. 

“All right, Gardner. I see what 
you mean.” He had meant to speak 
aloud, but his words were absorbed 
and muffled by the pressing blank- 
ness so that he did not know wheth- 
er he had actually spoken. But im- 
mediately he felt a hand on his 
shouldej. He got up, and the hand 
guided him along a winding track 
that led upward. 

Within a few steps his vision be- 
gan to clear, he saw the trees take 
shape like people in a Turkish bath 
and a few minutes later they were 



standing on the ridge looking down 
on the deceptively inviting country. 

“It’s just a little hazy down 
there, sir.” 

The engineer nodded apologeti- 
cally. 

“I’ll be off for the eggs. You stay 
up here and you’ll be all right.” 

The engineer watched the old 
man set off determinedly towards 
his raspberry patch, skirting the 
trees and shrubs without even look- 
ing up. When he was a hundred 
yards down the path the engineer 
turned and sprinted back to the 
ship. He mounted the ladder two 
steps at a time and skidded through 
the ship to the captain’s cabin. Once 
inside he shook Matsuki awake. 

“What’s the matter? Can’t you 
let anyone sleep?” 

“Up. cap’n,” said the engineer, 
saluting rudely. “Help’s needed.” 

Matsuki leapt out of bed instantly 
and made for the door that led onto 
the conrol deck. The engineer put 
his arm across it. 

“No trouble — yet. Relax. Just 
bring a rope, will you? And put on 
a robe. We’re going outside.” 

The captain sighed. “I’ll never get 
to sleep again now,” he said grump- 
ily. “I’ll come.” 

Soon they both stood on the grass 
outside, the engineer in his matted 
wool gown and slippers and the 
captain in a quilted silk coat with a 
black dragon on it and his wood- 
soled sandals. “We’ll go this way,” 
said the engineer and led his chief 
the same way he had gone earlier. 
When they reached the ridge he 
waited for the captain to stop yawn- 
ing and deep-breathing, and then

IF 




pointed to the raspberry patch and 
the dark dot within it which was 
the laboring Gardner. 

"Now,” he said. "I’m going to 
hold the rope and I want you to 
walk down there a ^ort way just 
paying out the rope as you go. 
Right?” 

"Sure, if that’s what makes you 
happy for today. How far do you 
think I should go?” 

"Please yourself, skipper. You 
won’t want to go far.” 

Shrugging his shoulders, the cap- 
lain gave the engineer the end of 
the rope and set off down the hill, 
paying it out off his arm. The engi- 
neer saw him set off steadily enough, 
then slow down and go more caut- 
iously; then the captain walked 
straight into a bramble bush, and 
fell in. The engineer heard him make 
some rude comments on the engineer 
and on the bush. Then he got up 
again. He was moving his hands 
cautiously ahead of hhn, and shuffl- 
ing his feet hesitantly. 

"All right, if you’re so clever!” 
rtiouted the captain. "What do I do 
now? 

"Come out,” said the engineer. 
The rope was still coiled around 
flie captain’s fist, so the engineer 
pulled gently "This way,” he shout- 
ed. Slowly and circumspectly (that 
is, with caution and care) the cap- 
tain climbed the hill. 

"Misty down there?” asked the 
wigineer when Matuski reached the 
top. 

"Misty? Are you kidding? It’s ab- 
solutely impenetrable.” He looked 
exasperated. 

what’s the story.” 



44^ome back to the ^p and 
^ tell you.” Together they set 
off over the ^ngy pine-ne^les. 
‘•Well, first, it’s not misty down 
diere. Not like with mist.” 

“I see what you mean. It’s not 
danrp.” 

"Second, it certainly is difficult to 
see. As if everything were out of 
focus and all energy were being ab- 
sorbed.” 

"Hmm.” 

"Well, now, when we’re both 
home at Glenn Reid and I’m visit- 
ing you for the evening, what do I 
do first and always?” 

"Kiss my wife, you slob.” 

“Well, second.” 

"Let me see. You get a drink. No, 
that’s not it. I know! You go over 
to the solido cabinet and fiddle with 
the knobs.” 

"Right. And what is the result?” 
“It sort of gets rid of some of the 
fog. I don’t know how it’s done.” 
"No. Well, I’m the engineer. But 
basically I’d say it stops the light 
running around like particles as dis- 
organized as a herd of pigs and gets 
them in neat rows like waves.” 

"So you once told me. But I don’t 
see any control panel.” 

"No, that’s ri^t, you don’t. But 
if I run into the ship I think I can 
lay my finger on a device which 
would do the same for the land- 
scape. You wait here and I’ll look.” 
The engineer climbed the ladder 
and rummaged around as promised 
and sure enough laid his hands on 
the thing he wanted. It was a round 
thingumajig with a handle on one 
end and a dark eye the other. He 
handed it to the captain. “That’s 



VANISHING POINT 




the feflow. Now one of us goes out 
and looks around. The other stays 
and watches the power gauges on 
the power beam to this thing, and 
looks after His Excellency.” 

“His Excellency will look after 
himself,” said Levine from the tc^ 
of the ladder. He was formally 
attired in a black tee-shirt and pin- 
stripe morning shorts. His hair was 
combed, his chin irreproachably 
shaved and his teeth shone as bright- 
ly as a control board in an emer- 
gency. 

“Good morning, you old liar,” 
shouted the captain. “This morning 
the entertainment is provided by 
the engine-room.” 

“Since we’re all here. I’ll kind of 
assign everyone to their places,” 
said the engineer, not at all taken 
aback. “Levine will sit here making 
us some coffee. If Gardner comes, 
say we’re out gathering shredded 
wheat in the plantations and we’fl 
be back any moment. I shall stay in 
the engine-room balancing the power 
output of the dibblefook that the 
captain’s carrying, and the intrepid 
captain shall walk down into the 
plain and see what he can see. 
Everybody know their lines?” 
Levine said, “I’ll be boiled if I 
know what’s going on around this 
camp, but don’t mind me.” 

The captain fingered the dancHe- 
prib experimentally. “I just press 
this button, huh?” 

“Right,” said the engineer. “And 
point the suttleprobe at what you 
want to see. Give me a moment to 
lock the direction-finder on you, and 
then start walking. If you’re not 
back by 1000 hours we’U send out 



the bloodhounds.” He turned and 
disappeared into the ship. A few 
moments later Levine and Matsuki 
heard the whine of the auxiliary 
power come on. The captain shrug- 
ged his shoulders and set off to- 
wards the pines. 

Well, for the next hour the engi- 
neer did what engineers do in en- 
gine-rooms when they’re controlling 
ganglehubs — 

(“You said dibblefook before. Dad- 
dy,” said Tammy. 

“Suttleprobe,” said Hannah. 

“Hush. I said dinglegrape.”) — 
And Levine did whatever people do 
with coffee. I should think he snooz- 
ed by the fire mostly. And finally 
the captain came running over the 
edge of the ridge and down into the 
camp. 

“The weirdest thing,” he panted. 
“The weirdest thing! Hey, grease- 
ball, come on out of the ship! Tve 
got news for you.” 

A few moments later the engineer 
came grinning down the ladder. 
“The gimbelsone really worked. It 
was sure drawing some power.” 

“Sure it worked. It was clearing 
out an area about 20 foot ahead and 
quite a bit on both sides and beyond 
that — just a wall of mist like a 
screen. Well, I walked down from 
the ridge and for, oh, say a hundred 
yards, two hundred, the country was 
like you’d expect — like an earthy 
slope, with some stones and rocki 
and grass and those old trees. 
these kept on, but I gradually had 
the impression the grass was getting 
finer and the trees were sort at 
stunted, or as if they were only 
bushes out there. Pretty soon it got 



90 





80 there wasn’t a thing growing 
i^ve knee high. Like toy trees. Or 
really like a Japanese garden — I 
remember those from when I was 
a kid. Well, here’s the weird thing. 
I kept on even further and those 
trees got smaller and smaller the 
further out I went, and about a 
hundred yards further on they were 
nothing but a fuzz on the ground 
and beyond that nothing at all. Just 
nothing at all. I was walking in a 
bubble of mist on bare steel plates. 
That’s all there is out there.” 

IV 

'"T^e engineer was the first to re- 
A act. He got up and walked out 
towards the ridge. The others fol- 
lowed. When they reached the line 
of pines they stopped. The old gard- 
ener was half way back from the 
distant raspberry patch, a hunched 
figure growing larger with each step. 

When he got up to where they 
stood in line cm the ridge he opened 
his kerchief and showed them a 
heap of speckly eggs and dark red 
fruit. *^1 see Mr. Matsuki and Mr. 
Levine got up. I hope you slept 
well.” 

“We were just going to haiw 
breakfast. Come and join us.” 

“Well, thank you kindly.” 

They walked over to the campsite 
in silence. Levine poured four mugs 
of coffee. Gardner fetched water 
from the spring and put the eggs 
on to boil. 

“Reckon you’ll be off in a few 
days,” he said. 

Levine nodded, “I’m afraid so. 
Tomorrow back to work.” 






VANISHING POINT 




“You won’t forget to ask if 1 
ean come back with you, will you?” 
“Of course not. You should see 
Earth. Earth’s really something.” 
The engineer had been gazing 
into the fire without saying anything 
aince breakfast started. Now he look- 
ed up and blurted out, “Look, I’m 
not sure you could come with us. 
It’s not as simple as that I” He pok- 
ed at the embers of the fire. “I 
think I could settle the matter, if 
we could do some tests.” 

“What would you want me to 
do?” 

“Well, first, when you go out 
beyond the ridge do you find it 
difficult to see?” 

“Yes, a little. But not so difficult 
as you. I’m more used to it.” 

“For instance, when you’re out 
where you were this morning, could 
you look back and see the pines 
round our camp?” 

“No. They’d be hidden in the 
mist. I’d lose sight of them after 
walking just a few minutes.” 

“Well, what I propose to do is fix 
up a sort of searchlight which will 
light up the trees on the ridge so 
that they can be seen from the 
plain. But you’ve got to think this 
over. There’s a possibility that what 
you see may be a sihock. But on the 
other hand we can’t take you back 
to Earth without doing some ex- 
periment like this. You ought to 
think it over.” 

“I have thought it over,” said 
Gardner. “I want to go and I’ll do 
anything that’s necessary. I can’t 
believe that there’s anything around 
here would surprise me after all 
these years.” 



“Right, then. Now here’s what 
we’ve got to do. I’m going to give 
the trundlebib to Levine, and you 
and he will go out to the perimeter. 
I’ll hook up a three-way communi- 
cation link, too. We’ll be able to 
hear anything you say, if you don’t 
go more than 30,000,000 miles out, 
and you’ll hear what we say. Just 
wait out here while I lock onto you.” 
The engineer refilled his mug 
from the pot by the fire and carried 
it with him into the ship. The sec- 
ondary power went on, and in a 
moment the three men heard his 
voice. It buzzed in their ears with 
a slight penetrating whine. Matsuki 
realized that the engineer must have 
tuned his output to resonate his 
hearer’s teeth. “Now if Levine and 
Gardner would walk towards the 
perimeter • . Any direction will 
do.” 

Matsuki watched them walk to- 
ward the pines. Around him buzzed 
a few gnats attracted by the camp 
fire. A few late summer leaves 
floated down from the lemon trees. 
The empy billycan over the fire 
rattled in the breeze.” 

S uddenly Levine’s voice buzzed in 
his head. “We reached the peri- 
meter.” 

“Now I want you both to go 
down about 20 yards.” 

“Right. We made it.” 

“I want Levine to place the dan- 
derglod on the ground facing up 
into the trees. Press it into the soil, 
that won’t hurt it. And go and stand 
under the trees where it’s pointing. 
From here on, Gardner must go 
alone.”

IF 




“rm quite used to that, if you 
don’t mind, my boy,” said Gardner. 

“Please go cautiously. Just go 
about 20 feet.” 

There was a pause. 

“I’ve done that,” said Gardner. 
“Now look back. What do you 
see?” 

“Well, there’s the line of pines, 
and under them’s Mr. Levine.” 
“Now, raise your hand and lift 
your little finger and see if it will 
cover Levine.” 

“Uh-huh. It just about does — all 
but his head.” 

“All right, now move on down. 
Now go slow. I don’t want you to 
move more than 20 feet, okay? Now 
look around you. What do you see?” 
“Everything’s pretty misty down 
here, of course. There’s the three 
palms with the grape-vines on them, 
just as usual. Grapes could do with 
picking. I’d say. Nothing else.” 
“Everything look about the right 
size?” 

“Sure thing. Mighty fine big 
grapes, though.” 

“Now look back towards Le- 
vine. See anything?” 

“No. Fog’s too bad at this level.” 
“Now, this is the important part. 
Keep looking towards Levine. I’m 
going to turn on the hubbleswopc. 
Remember — everything may be a 
bit distorted.” 

There was silence and then sud- 
denly a sharp intake of breath from 
the old man. “Quite a turn that 
gave me! Thought Mr. Levine was 
right on top of me for a moment, 
right next to me! But I see he’s still 
under the pines. Looks big, though.” 
“I thought that would be the 



effect. Hold up your finger and try 
to cover him up again.” 

“Well, that’s kind of funny. I — 
let me see — I just can, well, ’cept 
for his head.” 

“Hmm. Well, walk a little further 
and we’ll try again.” 

There was a long wait. “Don’t go 
too far!” 

“Hold your horses, young man,” 
said Gardner. “There’s something I 
want to do.” 

“I’m sorry,” said the engineer. 
“Let me know when you’re about 
ready.” 

There was a much longer silence, 
and Matsuki, looking up, noticed 
with a shock that the satellite’s sun 
was dead above die trees. Their 
breakfast hand stretched right into 
noontime. Suddenly Gardner spoke 
again. 

“I’m ready to look again now if 
you want to turn on the power.” 

“Here we go again, then.” 

Instantly they heard the old man 
scream hysterically, “Oh, God — 
he’s like a — !” 

The sentence ended in a choking 
groan. There was a grinding noise 
and a thump and then silence. 

Matsuki sprang up and upset the 
coffee pot into the fire where it 
hissed and bubbled. The engineer 
came flying down the ladder in one 
jump. He was shouting, “Everyone 
stay where they are! Levine stay 
under the pines. Matsuki stay by the 
fire and make some coffee and get 
the liquor out of the ship. Above 
all, Levine, don’t go down there!” 
He plunged through a thicket of 
light pink azaleas toward the peri- 
meter. 



VANISHING POINT

V 

VX/ell, there was nothing anyone 
could da. Levine said that 
after the old man had told the engi- 
neer to hold his horses, he’d set off 
much further into the plain until 
Levine had finally lost sight of him. 
If he’d fallen and hurt himself, we’d 
probably have never found his body. 
And if we walked down to him and 
he saw us coming it would just have 
made things worse. 

They stood together on the peri- 
meter near the spot where the old 
man had left Levine, and the engi- 
neer explained what it was the old 
man had seen and why. They left 
Matsuki looking out for the old man 
and the other two went back to the 
camp fire. Every two minutes Le- 
vine said over the telephone link, 
“Hullo, Mr. Gardner. Can you hear 
me? This is Levine. Please come up 
to the camp and I will explain.” 
Finally the old man answered. 
“I’ll come out. Wait up there for 
me. I think I must have fainted.” 
When he came up the rampart 
Matsuki took his arm and helped 
him to the campfire. There the 
Earthmen gave him coffee laced with 
whiskey from their First Aid kit. 

After a while he looked less pale. 
Finally he said, “It was the shock of 
seeing Mr. Levine — like a giant on 
the horizon — taller than your ship!” 
“I believe it,” said the engineer. 

“I guess you found out something 
I ought to know.” The engineer nod- 
ded glumly. “Something bad?” The 
engineer nodded again. “I can’t go 
back to Earth with you?” Nobody 
•poke. “Tell me why, please.” 



Matsuki looked at Levine. The 
engineer looked into the fire. Levine 
took a deep breath. “I’ll tell you,” 
he said. He got up and stood op- 
posite Gardner. “How big am I?” 
he asked. 

“Say, five foot nine.” 

“Hold your hand out straight, and 
try and cover me with your little 
finger. Can you do it?” 

“No.” 

“All right. I’m bigger than your 
finger.” He walked several paces 
further off. “Can you do it now?” 
“Almost.” 

“At this distance I’m almost small- 
er than your finger.” He walked out 
towards the perimeter and stopped 
again. “Try now,” he said. 

“I can do it easily now.” 

Levine ran back to the fire, and 
took out a sheet of drawing paper. 
He sketched an avenue of trees 
marching back into the distance and 
disappearing at the horizon. In the 
avenue he put three figures, one in 
the foreground, one in the middle- 
ground and one a long way away. 
“That’s me near,” he said, pointing 
to the first figure. “I look big. And 
here’s me further away, and here’s 
me a long way away. You can cover 
me up with just the tip of your 
finger. Well, when you actually look 
at me I’m always the same size — I 
just look smaller or larger. But this 
picture of me, this one in the front, 
actually is larger than the one in the 
back. Do you see?” 

The old man was not looking at 
Levine’s drawing any more; he was 
gazing out miserably towards the 
line of pines on the ridge. He nod- 
ded slowly.

Levine made a sign to the others 
and the three Earthmen walked un- 
happily back to their ship. After a 
while the engineer said bitterly, “We 
will have to thank the Federation 
for their hospitality. They meant 
very well by bringing us down in a 
picture of Earth. We just never got 
around to realizing they’d include a 
picture of an Earthman.” 

iiT^hat’s not all,” said Tammy 
A after a moment. “You 
haven’t told what the old man did.” 
“That’s really the sad part. I 
didn’t want to tell you a sad story 
at bedtime.” 

“I know, Daddy, but it’s part of 
the story, isn’t it?” 

“Yup, I guess so. Well, after a 
time the old man came up to Levine 
holding the sketch and said, ‘And 
when you’ve finished with your pic- 
ture you just put it away in its fold- 
er?’ Levine nodded. The old man put 
hk brown finger in the middle of 
tile horizon. ‘What happens back 
there?* 

“ ‘We call it the vanishing point. 
AH the lines in the picture are sup- 
posed to meet there and vanish.’ 

“ ‘I’ll head that way. I’m still a 
human being and I’d like to go out 
like one,’ 

“I can’t remember we found any- 
thing to say to that. He went off to 
do his work as usual, and the next 
morning he came in with a chicken 
and a couple of pineapples. 



“ ‘A farewell present,’ he said. 
‘I’ve a bit of everything out there. 
I’ll do all right along the way.’ 

“So sometime after breakfast we 
sort of all got up together and went 
out to the pines. And there we just 
all shook hands and he tucked his 
old striped cloth in his belt and 
picked up his staff and set off down 
the track. It was a fantastically 
dear day. For a long, long time the 
three men, Matsuki, Levine and the 
engineer watched him getting small- 
er and smaller. 

“And that is all.” 

F or a short time neither of the 
children spoke. Then Tammy 
opened her eyes. 

“My picture, the teacher at school 
said it was very advanced, the way 
I’d made the people get smaller to- 
ward the back of the picture. She 
said most children don’t do that be- 
cause it’s not the way it looks to 
most children. Well, it doesn’t. I 
just drew it how you said it hap- 
pened. Didn’t I?” She snuggled 
down under the covers. 

“Sure you did, turnip. Sure.” 
After a moment or two he said, 
“Hey-ho, why don’t you two fellows 
go to sleep, ho?” Neither answered, 
so he disengaged his hand from 
Hannah’s moist fist, kissed them 
both on the tops of their heads, 
tiptoed into the hallway leaving their 
door ajar and ran down the stairs 
to look for his wife. END

THE 



HEAT RACERS 



by L. D. OGLE 



Come along for o day's sailing-^ 
with the sun filling your sheets 
and the around beneath vour keel! 



T he skipper’s voice came softly 
over the intercom, “Easy does 
it fellows, let’s not jump the gun.” 
We were at 1,500 feet, this was 
a bit higher than the pattern of the 
minimum of 1,000 feet required by 
tiie National Heat-Racing Club, 
but the skipper is a cautious person 
and didn’t want to be disqualified by 
being too low when the starting 
gun sounded. The five-minute gun 
had already sounded and we were 
stooging around absorbing just 
enough heat to keep our craft under 
motion and maintain our altitude. 
Fred was concentrating on our 
radio, listening for the high-pitched 
bleep that would be the starting gun. 
The starting gun? Well this is a left- 
over from the old wind yacht days, 
when they used a chemical combus- 
tion weapon to signal the start of a 
race. 

X 



“Three seconds to go,” said Fred 
quietly, “one, two, three.” 

The skipper swung the console 
around to bring us on course, and 
in the electronic deck below I saw 
the light flash ALL FULL. I trim- 
med my absorbers to take the ^ock 
of full power. 

I heard the skipper say, “Danm,” 
and looking through the starboard 
port I saw the Thermo Queen 
squeeze between us and the buoy. 
The Thermo Queen was our closest 
rival and there was no denying k, 
she was a beautiful ship. She was 
the very latest thing in heat-racing 
yachts. Her huge black heat-absorb- 
ing sails were the same size as ours 
according to the rules of the N. H. 
R. C. 

Her sails were designed to pick 
up even the most distant rays and 
reflections of heat. I have seen her 



96 



MHing in the predawn rays of the 
rising sun, skimming along at mini- 
mum altitude to save her heat, and 
making me lose my heart to the 
beauty of her black sails contrast- 
ing with her chromalloy hull. 

She is all self-contained and com- 
pletely powered by heat-absorbing 
machinery as is required by the club. 
Her old-fashioned radio is powered 
by the body heat of the operator, 
and her skipper even had the fore- 
sight to get a rather fat man for an 
operator. 

W e kidded him about using some 
of his own heat to power the 
ship. Our ship the Heat Ranker is 
an old timer, as is our skipper, and 
the two were an almost unbeatable 
combination until the Queen was 
built two years ago. 

Then this young skipper and his 
new ship started showing us his lit- 
tle black exhaust tubes and the af- 
ter end of the Queen. The Queen^s 
skipper used a new type console to 
steer and balance his ship. It was 
equipped with colored indicators to 
show the amount of heat being ab- 
sorbed, whereas our skipper pre- 
ferred the old type upon which he 
could place his hands and sensitive 
fingers on the plates on top of the 
console and feel just how much 
heat each sail was absorbing. The 
skipper had these plates tuned so 
fine that if we were absorbing too 
much heat the plates would bum 
your fingers. It was a real sight to 
see the skipper, sometimes with his 
eyes closed, passing his hands over 
those plates like a musician. 

We are a good crew, the five of 



us, and the skipper has complete 
faith in us. He never repeats an or- 
der twice. 

The serious-looking fellow is 
Fred, our radio operator. He isn’t as 
serious as he looks though, and can 
be a lot of fun at a party. He is 
rather thin and sometimes he has to 
run an extension to my body to 
reach some far-away station. 

The big guy is Big George. He is 
our mainsail handler, he needs to 
be big to trim the port and star sails. 
He can spin the adjusting wheels as 
if they were spacephone dials. 

To offset George’s size and to 
work the little sails in the small 
parts of the ship we have Slim. 

Just then the Air Guard came in 
strong over the air. “Air Guard Sev- 
en to all craft, all commercial and 
pleasure craft will clear the one- to 
two-thousand foot level in Sector Six 
for the National Heat Races.” 

We crossed the starting line neck 
and neck with the Queen followed 
by twenty six other racers hard on 
our heels. 

The Queen immediately headed 
for a ground highway where the 
concrete at this time of day would 
be throwing up all kinds of heat. 
Our skipper headed for a smafl 
ridge which was going roughly m 
our direction and told George to 
adjust his sails for maximum B.T. 
U.’s on both port and star sails. We 
weren’t going at top speed, but we 
did not have to fill our condensm 
with stored heat to keep from bum* 
ing our sails — as the Queen must 
have been doing. We would save ow 
condensers for later when we need- 
ed them. The skipper switdied to 



THE HEAT RACERS 



97 




following a river and I had to put 
a few B.T.U.’s in the condenser 
bank. 

W e were passing over a patch of 
woods when the skipper told 
George to shorten sail a bit and let 
me use our banked heat. 

We could see most of the fleet 
above and below us and quite a few 
ahead of us. We weren’t too wor- 
ried because many times before wc 
had been dead last and had managed 
to come over the finish line first in 
a blast that would be at the very 
thermal limits of our sail. 

Looking out of the port 1 saw 
below us some small crafts cruising 
about a large sandpit and called the 
akipper’s attention to it. The skip- 
per called die boys. *^Heat Ranger 
to peanut fleet, can we use your 
thermos?” 

**Peanut Commodore to Heat Ran- 
^ger, be our guest, please. We haven’t 
forgotten that you gave us your last 
year’s sails. The heat range is from 
force twelve to fifteen, watch the 
middle it’s a litde strong there.” 

The boys pulled over to the side 
and watched as we swooped down 
over the sandpot humping up in the 
middle in order not to bank any 
heat as yet. 

We came tearing right up through 
the middle of the fleet and we could 
hear the boys cheering us on their 
mini seta. 

Soon after we were gaining on the 
Thermo Queen and were about to 
pass it when suddenly a big luxury 
boat came up. ShQ was operating on 
transmitted power and hit us from 
below, damaging our spanker sad 



and hull near the after section and 
shaking us up a bit. Nothing for us 
to do, but stop. 

We dropped our magna anchor 
and used the heat from a large 
warehouse roof to keep us aloft 
while we inspected the damage. 

Slim crawled aft. The spanker sail 
was easily repaired with growing 
plastic compound, but we could not 
r^air the hull until we dry docked 
her. 

The skipper put on < his magnasuit 
and crawled outside to inspect the 
hull. Wc would be able to continue 
without being a menace to naviga- 
tion, but the damage would slow our 
progress. We were happy to hear 
the Air Guard taking the luxury 
boat into custody for interference. 

We were dead last now, and using 
what little heat I had banked only 
took us near the fleet, but not near 
enough. 

We stayed low and searched for 
new reflections. The skipper found 
a small lake just chock full of 
sparkling reflections from the noon- 
day sun and we were tearing along 
at near top speed, banking a few 
B.T.U.’b in the condensers. 

W e passed the old Hot Mama 
and then the Shamrock and 
were behind and below the Queen. 
The skipper cocked a wary eye up- 
ward. “Watch him now,” he said, 
“he’ll duplicate our every move. If 
we can fool him we have the race.” 
“Saim, can the Queen sec the port 
sail from where she is?” 

“No,” answered SKm. 

“(toy, then George take m the 
port safl as much m possible, and 



98 



ir 




Slim you see if you can make the 
«hip balance out with the spanker 
sail. Bill you give her all she’s got.” 

We were gaining on the Queen 
very fast now, but I could see them 
spreading all the sail they could get 
out. 

The Queen was absorbing too 
much heat and I could see from 
where I stood, the outer edges of 
her sails start to glow red from 
the heat, then white, and then I 
saw pieces of glowing sail drop off 
and fall to the earth. She was soon 
behind us. 

“Stand by for the finish,” said 
Fred and he switched the intercom 
on to the radio band. We stood sil- 
ent for a few minutes and then we 
heard the long bleep that said we 
were over the finish line — first. 

The old ship practically vibrated 
with our cheers. Then George said 
over the intercom, “Now Bill?” 

“Now,” I said. 

I went up to the bridge to take 
over the ship while George and Slim 
put a paravane on the struggling and 
protesting skipper. They opened the 
hatch and threw him out of the ship 
at fifteen thousand feet. This was 
an old tradition from the wind ship 
days. 

“Have fun,” laughed George, “I 



certainly hope you fall into some- 
thing good.” 

I took the ship over to the moor- 
ing ground, dropped the magna an- 
chor and put her away for the day. 

“Now for the party, everybody 
come up to the bridge deck.” I 
opened a small drawer in the con- 
sole and took out the drinks, a tray, 
full of drink tablets. 

“What will you have, the clear 
ones are champagne, the frosty ones 
are gin and the amber ones are 
beer. I like the amber ones with the 
blue stripe, that’s blue ribbon beer.” 

We were singing “What will you 
do with a drunken sailor,” and do- 
ing very good at harmonizing, when 
the main hatch opened and there 
stood the skipper . 

The skipper I knew did not drink 
and I thought, oh boy here’s where 
we get it. 

“Hello boys, excuse me for being 
so wet, I fell into a swimming pool. 
May I join your party?” 

I dumped a couple of champagne 
tablets into a glass of water and 
had it in the skipper’s hand before 
he stopped talking. 

“Oh what do you do with a 
drunken sailor, what do you do with 
a drunken sailor, early in the morn- 
ing.” END

The Hoogans owned the planet — they said 
so themselves. But who were the creatures 
from underground who disputed their claim? 



I 

T he Hoogan chamberlain was 
tall, black-clad, and high-shoul- 
dered. He had an immense dome- 
shaped head sloping on to his mas- 
sive shoulders. His eyes were like 
freshly shelled oysters in a leathery 
face and he had long, dangling arms. 

He turned to face the party of 
Terrestrial diplomats who stood 



clutching suifcases under the lofty 
vaulted ceiling of the vast, daik 
hall. Shafts of eerily colored light 
filtered through stained-glass loop- 
holes, which were high in the walk, 
shedding a faint glow on the un- 
even stone floor. The drab-colored 
murals and hangings depicted the 
specialities of the seven Hoogan 
Hells. The mouths of dark corridofs 
radiated from the circular chamber 



100 





with helmeted and kilted Hoogan 
pikemen spaced between them, im- 
mobile as the gargoyles that peered 
from high niches. 

“His Arrokanze the Pishop has 
graziously blaced at your dispozal 
theze cozy quarters,” the chamber- 
lain said in a deep, hollow voice. 
“You may now zelect rooms on the 
floors above and array yourselves 
in the karments provided.” 

“Look here, Mr. Odom-Glom,” 
Ambassador Straphanger cut in, 
“Fve been thinking it over, and Fve 
decided that my staff and I will just 
nip back over to our ship for the 
night.” 

“His Arrokanze will be egspectink 
you at the fete in the Ebiscobal 
Kardens in one hour’s time,” tte 
Hoogan bored on. “His Arrokamte 
tizlikes to be kept waitink.” 

“Oh, we’re all keenly aware of 
the honor His Arrogance has paid 
us in offering accomodations here 
in the Episcopal Palace, but — ” 
“One hour,” Odom-Glom repeat- 
ed, his voice echoing across the hall. 
He turned away, the symbolic chain 
attached to his neck clanking as he 
moved. He paused, turned back. 

“By the way, you are instrugted 
to iknore any small ah . indru- 
zions. If you zee anything . un- 
usual, zummon a guard at onzc.” 
“Intrusions?” Straphanger repeat- 
ed querulously. “What kind of in- 
trusions?” 

“The balace,” Odom-Glom said, 
“is haunted.” 

F our twisting turns of a stone 
staircase above the reception 
hall. Second Secretary Magnan t^ 



toed at Retiefs side. They went 
along an echoing corridor, past 
black iron-bound doors and mouldy 
tapestries which were dimly visible 
in the light of a flambeau. 

“Quaint beliefs these bucolics en- 
tertain,” Magnan said in a tone of 
forced heartiness. “Haunted indeed! 
How silly! Ha!” 

“Why are you whispering?” Re- 
lief inquired. 

“Just out of respect for the Bis- 
hop, of course.” Magnan came to 
an abrupt halt, and clutched Relief’s 
sleeve. “Wha-what’s that?” he point- 
ed. 

Along the corridor, something 
small and dark slipped from die 
shadow of a pilaster to the shelt» 
of a doorway. 

“Probably just our imagination,” 
Relief suggested. 

“But it had big red eyes,” Mag- 
nan protested. 

“Tliey’re as easy to imagine at 
any other kind.” 

“I just remembered — ^I left my 
shower cap in my hold baggage. 
Let’s go back.” 

Relief moved off. “It’s just a few 
doors farther. Six, seven . here 
we are.” He inserted the key Odom- 
Glom’s aide had provided. The 
heavy door swung open with a creak 
that descended Ae scale to a low 
groan. Magnan, hurrying forward, 
paused to stare at Ae nearest wail- 
hanging which showed a group of 
Hoogans suspended head-down from 
spikes above leaping flames, while 
goblins of various shapes prodded 
Aem wiA long barb-tipped spears. 

“Curious how similar religious 
art is from one world to another,”

he commented. Inside the room, he 
stared around in dismay at the damp 
stone walls, the two spartan cots and 
carved devils which stood in the 
corners. 

“What perfectly ghastly quar- 
ters!” He dropped his suitcase and 
went over to prod the nearest bunk. 
*^^hy, my spine will never endure 
this mattress! Fll be a physical 
wreck after the first night! And the 
draft — I’m sure to catch a chill. 
And . and ...” He broke off. 

Magnan raised a shaky finger to 
point at the darkest corner of the 
Barrow chamber where a tall, bug- 
eyed demon carved from pale blue 
stone winked garnet eyes. 

“Retief! Something moved over 
there — it was just like the devils 
in the pictures! All fuzzy red bris- 
des and eyes that glow in the dark!” 

Retief opened his suitcase. “If 
you see another one, throw a shoe 
at it. Right now, we’d better be 
getting into costume; compared with 
an aroused ambassador, a few devils 
are just friendly pets.” 

H alf an hour later, after having 
sponged off at a stone sink, 
Magnan’s eyes were still rolling ner- 
vously. He adjusted the folds of his 
Hoogan ceremonial sarong before 
#ie tarnished, rippled mirror. 

“I suppose it is just nerves,” he 
■aid. “It’s all the fault of that Odom- 
.Glom fellow anck his quaint native 
iuperstitions! I confess his remarks 
quite unnerved me for a moment.” 
Across the room, Third Secre- 
tary Retief was loading match-head 
■iz^ charges into the magazine of 
an inconspicuous handgun. 



“Probably just his way of warn- 
ing us about the mice,” he said. 

Magnan turned and caught a 
glimpse of the gun. “Here, Retief! 
What’s that?” 

“Just a quaint native cure for 
spooks — if they get too noisy.” 
He tucked the gun out of sight 
under the Hoogan sarong. “Just 
think of it as a sort of good-luck 
charm, Mr. Magnan.” 

“A knife up the sleeve is an old 
diplomatic tradition,” Magnan said 
doubtfully. “But a power pistol un- 
der the sarong ...” 

“I’ll have it along in case some- 
thing jumps out of the stonework 
and yells boo!” Retief said reassur- 
ingly. 

Magnan sniffed, admiring himself 
in the dark glass. 

“I was rather relieved when the 
ambassador insisted on native dress 
for the staff instead of ceremonial 
nudity for tonight’s affair.” He turn- 
ed to study the hang of the uneven 
hemline that exposed his bare shins. 
“One of his finer moments, I fan- 
cied. He does cut an impressive 
figure, once his jowls get that pur- 
plish tinge. Not even Odom-Glom 
dared stand up to him. Though I 
do wish he’d gone just the one step 
further and demanded the right to 
wear trousers — ” He broke off, his 
eyes on the black drapes covering 
the high, narrow window. 

The heavy cloth twitched. 

“Retief!” he gasped. “There it is 
again!” 

“Shhh,” Retief watched as the 
curtain moved again. A tiny red- 
glowing bead appeared at its edge, 
a foot above the floor; a wire-thin 



102 





kg emerged, and then another. A 
body like a ball of reddish fluff 
came into view, its red-bead eyes on 
two-inch stalks which tilted alertly 
lo scan the chamber. Its gaze fixed 
on Relief; it moved clear of the 
curtain, paused, then started toward 
him on skittery legs — 

W ith a yell, Magnan dived for 
the door and flung it wide. 
“Guards! Help! Goblins! Spooks!” 
His voice receded along the hall, 
mingling with the clank of accou- 
trements, and the slap of wide Hoo- 
gan feet. 

The intruder hesitated at the out- 
cry, dithered for a moment, then, 
emitting a cry like a goosed fairy, 
fumbled with two of its limbs at 
comething attached to its back. 
Beyond the door, Magnan’s voice 



supplied a shrill counterpoint to the 
rumble of Hoogan questions. 

“Then get someone who speaks 
Terran!” he yelped. “At this mo- 
ment my associate is being savaged 
by the monster!” 

Relief crossed quickly to the win- 
dow, pulled the drapes aside and 
unlatched a panel, letting in a draft 
of damp night air. 

“This way out, fellow,” he said. 
“You’d better get going before the 
cops arrive.” 

The fluffball darted across the 
room and came to a shaky stop be- 
fore Relief. He made quick, nervous 
motions. A folded square of paper 
fell to the floor at Retief s feet. Then 
the creature sprang for the opening 
and was gone as Hoogan feet clump- 
ed at the door. 

“Where Spism?” a heavy voice

Jemantled in thick Terran. A coni- 
cal Hoogan head in a flaring helmet 
swivelled to scan the room. 

Behind the guard, Magnan cran- 
ed for a view. "Where is the beast?” 
he shrilled. “It was at least four- 
feet high, and its tusks were four- 
inches long at the very leasti” 

The Hoogan advanced into the 
room. He pointed to the open win- 
dow with his broad-headed seven- 
foot pike. 

"It was a mouse after all,” Redef 
said. “It got away.” 

“You let Spism ko?” 

“Shouldn’t I have?” Retief inquir- 
ed mildly, pocketing the paper. 

“Spism bad imp from nether re- 
chions; might bite Derry, get blood 
boizonink.” 

“I think you’re being imperti- 
nent,” Magnan said sharply. “Biting 
Tcrrans is perfectly safe — ” 

The Hoogan turned to him, his 
pike lowered ominously. 

iC^’l^ou will gome with me,” it 
A ordered. “The benaldy for 
consortink with minions of Unter- 
worlt is poilink in oil.” 

“Here,” Magnan said, backing up. 
“Stand back, my man — ” 

The Hoogan reached for Mag- 
nan with a long, snaky hand; Retief 
stepped up behind him, selected a 
spot, and struck a sharp blow with 
bunched fingertips. The guard 
stumbled, fell past Magnan, and hit 
chin first with a resounding slam. 
His pike shattered against the wall. 

“Retief!” Magnan gobbled. “What 
are you thinking of? You’ve laid 
hands on a member of the Episcopal 
Guard!” 



“I had the distinct impression th»' 
this fellow hooked a toe on the ru 
imd fell down. BKdn’t yoo* notice'' 
“Why, you know very well — ” 
“Just before he reached you^ M) 
Magnan.” 

“Ah . why yes, now that yoi 
mention it, he did trip,” Magnan’* 
tone was suddenly brisk. “Nasty fall. 
I rushed up to support him, but alas, 
too late. Poor fellow. Served him 
right, the brute. Shall we go through 
his pockets?” 

“Why?” 

“You’re right; there isn’t time. 
That crash was doubtless heard 
throughout the palace.” 

A second Hoogan appeared at the 
open door, his helmet bearing the 
fanged angel, which was indicative 
of officer rank. He eyed the fallen 
pikeman. 

“You addacked this one?” he de- 
manded. 

Magnan glanced at the victim as 
though noticing him for the first 
time. “He seems to have fallen 
down,” he observed brightly. 

“Against rules to kill Hoogan,” 
the captain said ominously. 

“He . ah . broke his spear,” 
Magnan pointed out helpfully. 

“Very bad crime, defile cere- 
monial spear,” the captain said 
sternly. “Require burification zere- 
mony. Very expenzive.” 

Magnan fumbled in a money 
pouch at one hip. “I’d love to con- 
tribute a little something.” 

“Ten Hoogan gredits, forget die 
whole thing. For extra five dizpose 
of body.” 

The felled Hoogan stirred, mum- 
bled, sat up.

iiTTa!” the captain said. “Look 
/ m like no teal. But for another 
extra five — ” he lifted a short, ugly 
club from his belt, “ — finish off 
unfortimate victim of Derry vio- 
lence.” 

“Stop!” Magnan yelled. “Are you 
out of your mind?” 

“Inzult to overseer castle briest 
cosd you two more gredits. For you 
I mage zpecial brice, three for five.” 

“Bribery?” Magnan gasped. “Cor- 
ruption?” 

“Three it is,” the Hoogan nod- 
ded. “How about you?” he turned 
to Relief. “You short like other 
Derry?” 

“Look here, Fm paying you noth- 
ing!” Magnan barked. “Just assist 
this unfortunate chap out of here, 
if you please, and we’ll get on with 
our dressing!” 

“Small religious contributions fine 
old Hoogan gustom!” the overseer 
protested. “You want to fiolate local 
tapoos?” 

“We Terrans have a few customs 
of our own,” Relief put in smooth- 
ly. “We feel that graft should only 
be paid voluntarily.” He offered a 
note which the officer palmed deft- 
ly. The guard was on his feet now, 
swaying. The captain barked an or- 
der, his subordinate gathered up the 
spear fragments, shot Magnan a 
poisonous look and departed, follow- 
ed by the captain. 

Relief closed the door behind the 
departing visitors, fished out the 
scrap of paper dropped by the flee- 
ing Spism and opened it.

YELLOW DUNG FLOWER. 



Magnan, busy at the mirror again, 
heaved a deep sigh. 

“Hardly an auspicious beginning,” 
he commented. “Heavens! It’s twen- 
ty-thirty! We’re late!” He gave his 
sarong a final tug and smoothed a 
thinning lock across his forehead. 

He led the way along the echo- 
ing hall and down a spiral stair to 
an archway debouching onto wide 
steps above a ragged lawn. Blue lan- 
terns hanging in the branches of 
skeletal trees shed a wan radiance 
on the fungus-like ornamental plants. 
Sculptures representing souls in tor- 
ment, were placed near wide tables 
laden with Terran delicacies hastily 
unloaded from the Corps transport 
for the occasion. A dozen grotes- 
quely shaped fountains spread a fine 
mist and an odor of sulphur across 
the festive scene. 

Beyond the high spike-topped 
wall, the ominous shape of an im- 
mense brass-colored idol reared up 
half a mile away. Its ferocious sculp- 
tured grin glowing in the glare of 
spotlights, its right arm raised in 
the Hoogan royal salute — elbow 
straight out, forearm pointing up-' 
ward with fingers spread, the left 
hand gripping the right biceps. 

Magnan shuddered. 

“That beastly idol — it’s sub- 
Hoogan,” Magnan commented. 
“Isn’t that smoke coming out of its 
nostrils?” 

Relief sniffed. “Something’s bum' 
ing,” he agreed.

A dark figure stepped from dense 
shadow at Magan’s elbow.

*^Only old newsbabers you scent,” it 
rumbled. “Our Hoogan Kods are 
uzeful; they serve as gommunity in- 
zinerators.” 

“Odom-Glom! You startled me!” 
Magnan chirped. He slapped at an 
insect that buzzed about his face. 
“I do hope the evening is a big 
success. It was so thoughtful of his 
Arrogance to allow the Corps to act 
as host tonight; such a gesture of 
acceptance — sort of.” 

“Reverze hosbitality iz an old 
Hoogan gustom,” Odom-Glom said. 
“It would be a kood itea to know 
all our old Hoogan gustoms, zo az 
not to end up lige the lasd Derran 
Tiplomat.” 

“Yes, it was unfortunate about 
Ambassador Straphanger’s predeces- 
sor getting excommunicated, and all. 
But really, how was he to know he 
was supposed to fill the Episcopal 
begging bowl with hundred-credit 
notes,?” 

“It wasn’t zo much not contribut- 
ink; but pourink the canned beans 
in spoiled the bill His Arrokanze had 
planted as a hint.” 

“A bad scene,” Magnan agreed. 
“But I’m sure this evening will 
smooth everything over.” 

The orchestra began tuning up 
and lugubrious notes groaned across 
the lawn. Armed Episcopal guards 
were taking up their posts, and 
sarong-clad diplomats were forming 
a receiving line by a stone arch 
opening through which the digni- 
taries would arrive. 

“I must hurry alonk now and zee 
to the kun emplazements,” Odom- 
Glom said. “One lasd suggestion: 
wordly goods of course mean noth- 



ing to His Arrokanze, but tha 
deadliest of the zinz is Ztinchinezz. 
His Arrokanze detests a tightwad.” 
He moved off, chains clashing. 

“The ambassador's not out yet,” 
Magnan noted nervously. “Gracious, 
I hope he puts in an appearance be- 
fore Bishop Ai-Poppy-Googy arrives. 

I dread the prospect of having to 
engage His Arrogance in light chit- 
chat.” 

44 A ccording to the Post Report, 
dealing with the Bishop is 
very simple,” Relief said. “Just give 
him everything in sight, and if that 
doesn’t satisfy him, give him some 
more.” 

“I can see that you’re finally get- 
ting the hang of diplomacy. Relief,” 
Magnan said approvingly. “Still, I’m 
worried.” 

“Since it’s your job as protocol 
officer to soften up difficult guests,” 
Relief 5aid, “why not meet the Bish- 
op at the gate and try out a few 
racy stories on him?” 

“I hardly imagine that the Chief 
of State of a Theocracy would re- 
act to biological anecdotes,” Mag- 
nan said stiffly. 

“Oh, biology is a perfectly clean 
subject here on Hoog; but don’t 
bring up cooking in polite conver- 
sation. According to the handbook, 
there’s an unspoken agreement 
among the cultured element that the 
stork brings the goodies.” 

“Really? Heavens, and all the 
cookies are stamped ‘Made in Hong 
Kong’! I’ll have to tell the cook to 
substitute blintzes. While I’m attend- 
ing to that, you’d best take your 
post at the gate. You’ll handle the

first shift tonight. I’ll send String- 
whistle along to relieve you in an 
hour.” 

“I could delay the Bishop a few 
minutes for you,” Retief offered, as 
they crossed to the gate. ‘‘Suppose 
I start by demanding to see his in- 
vitation.” 

“None of your ill-timed japes, 
Retief! After the last mission’s fias- 
co, establishing a friendly rapport 
with the Bishop tonight could mean 
promotions all around.” 

“I think the traditional lawn party 
is a little too subtle for a fellow like 
the Bishop. We should have used a 
simple symbolism — like a few 
rounds of heavy artillery lobbed into 
the palace grounds.” 

“Hardly the diplomatic approach,” 
Magnan sniffed. “For centuries now 
it’s been understood that if enough 
diplomats go to parties, everything 
will come right in the end.” 

“I wonder if the Hoogans under- 
stand that tradition?” 

“Certainly; after all, we’re all 
fellow beings — ^brothers under the 
skin, as it were.” 

“In this case, the skin is an inch 
thick and tougher than armorplast. 
Fm not sure we can pentrate to the 
brotherhood layer in time to stop 
bloodshed.” 

“Actually, I rather look forward 
to matching epigrams with His Ar- 
rogance tonight,” Magnan said loft- 
ily, turning to scan the gardens. “As 
you know. I’m always at my spark- 
ling best with high-ranking guests 
— and, of course, mere size and 
strength fail utterly to intimidate 
me.”

him, uttered a strangled yelp, and 
trampled a Hoog waiter’s foot as 
he leaped back from the spectacle 
of a seven-foot high, six-foot wide 
Hoog wrapped in cloth of gold. The 
monster’s gilded features included 
one-inch nose holes, huge, watery, 
reddish eyes and a wide mouth set 
in a formal grimac to display polish- 
ed gold-capped teeth. Two clusters of 
ringed fingers gripped the hilt of 
an immense two-edged sword.

bellowed. He leaned 
forward, sniffed vigorously at Mag- 
nan and snorted. 

‘‘Horriple!” he announced, elbow- 
ing Magnan aside. *‘Ko away, vel- 
low! You’re invested with an acute 
P.O.!” 

“Why, Your Arrogance — it’s just 
a touch of skin bracer in back of ray 
ear.” 

“It smelts like pargain night in a 
choy house. Where’s Ambassador 
Hapstrinker? I drust you have blenty 
of food reaty. l unterstant you Ber- 
ries take a kreat interesd in gook- 
ing.” The Bishop winked a damp, 
pink eye, rammed Magnan under the 
ribs, and guffawed comfortably. 

“Oof!” Magnan said. “Why, Your 
Arrogance!” 

The Bishop was already striding 
toward the nearest table, his escort 
of armed and helmeted guards trail- 
ing behind, fingering scimitars and 
eyeing the diplomats suspiciously. 

“I ... I think I’ll just scoot along 
and see to the refreshments,” Mag- 
nan bleated. “Retief, you accom- 
pany His Arrogance and keep him 
amused until help arrives — I mean,

until the ambassador puts in an iq>- 
pearance!” He fled. 

The Bishop dipped a boneless 
finger into a large crystal container 
of cheese sauce, studied it at arm’s 
length, sniffed it, then, with a flick 
of a limber wrist, spattered it across 
the ruffled shirt fronts and glassy 
smiles of the diplomats strung out 
in the receiving line. 

“Who are these leavers?” he de- 
manded loudly. “Bropaply relatives, 
waitink arount for handout^. I have 
the zame proplem. Or had the zame 
proplem, I should zay. Two weeks 
ako was Zelf-Denial Feztival. I 
made the subreme sagrifize ant of- 
fered the entire lot to the anzestral 
spirids.” 

“Giving up your relatives for Lent 
is quite an idea,” Retief said. “It 
could catch on.” 

The Bishop picked up a plate of 
dainty sandwiches, spilled the food 
off, sniffed the plate, and took a 
small bite. “I’ve heard a kreat teal 
about Derran tishes,” he said, chew- 
ing noisily. “A bit too crizp, but not 
pat.” He took a second nip from the 
thin porcelain and offered it to Re- 
tief. 

“Have a bite,” he invited genially. 

“No thanks, I filled up on a beer 
bottle just before Your Arrogance 
arrived,” Retief countered. “Try 
the dinner plates. They’re said to 
be an epicure’s delight.” 

T here was a sudden stir from the 
vicinity of the wide terrace 
doors. Ambitious diplomatic under- 
lings sprang to positions of eager 
anticipation, their delighted smiles 
ready. The squat figure of Carea*

Minister Straphanger, Terrestrial 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Min- 
ister Plenipotentiary to Hoog wad- 
dled into view, stylishly decked out 
in a short but heavily brocaded Hoo- 
gan longhi, a brilliant red sash which 
all but dragged the ground, and jew- 
eled sandals. At his side puffed a 
companion of almost identical, build 
and garb, distinguished only by a 
mop of vivid orange hair. Magnan 
trailed by two yards. 

“Ah, the ambassador is twints?” 
the Bishop inquired, moving toward 
the approaching pair. 

“No, that’s Mrs. Straphanger,” 
Retief said. “If I were Your Arro- 
gance I’d ditch that saucer; i she's 
fierce when aroused.” 

“Ah, the edernal female, ever 
conzerned with food gonzervation.” 
The Bishop tossed a crust of the 
plate in back of a flowering bush. 

“Ah, there, Ambassador Strak- 
humper!” he bellowed. “And your 
charmink cow! She will be litterink 
zoon, I trust?” 

“Littering? How’s that?” Strap- 
hanger stared around in confusion. 

“I azzume you keep your cows 
pregnant?” the Bishop boomed. “Or 
possibly thiz one is over-aged. Bud 
no matter; doubtless she waz a gread 
broducer in her day.” 

“Well, I never!” Mrs. Straphanger 
snapped, bridling. 

“By the way,” Ai-Poppy-Googy 
went on, “I hate to disguss finanzes 
over food, zo I suggesd we deal 
with the broplem of an abbrobriate 
kift ad onze. I am of gourse quite 
brebared to vorget the drivial mis- 
unterstantink with the former am- 
passator ant agcepd any zum in eg- 



zess of one million gredits withoud

“One million credits?” Straphang- 
er babbled. “Gift?” 

“Of gourse, if you wish to avoid 
aquirink a reputation az a piker, an 
egstra million would not be taken 
amiss.” 

“A million credits of Corps funds? 
But . but whatever for?” 

“Ah, ah,” the Bishop waggled an 
admonitory tactile member. “No 
pryink into Hoogan internal mat- 
ters!” 

“Oh, no, indeed, Your Arrogance! 
I only meant . what’s the occa- 
sion? For the gift. I mean.” 

“It’s Tuesday.” 

“Oh.” 

The Bishop nodded placidly. 
“Luggy you didn’t throw thiz affair 
on Wentsday; thad’s douple gifd 
day.” He plucked a glass from a tray 
offered by a bearer, emptied the 
contents on the lawn and nipped a 
chip from the edge with his polished 
metallic teeth, munching thought- 
fully. 

“Lackink in flavor,” he com- 
mented. 

44]V /Ty best crystal,” Mrs. Strap- 
iVl hanger gasped. “All the 
way from Brooklyn, yet, and like a

“A koat?” The Bishop eyed her 
suspiciously. “I don’t belief I know 
the term.” 

“It’s a ... a sort of gourmet,” 
Straphanger improvised. Sweat was 
glistening on his forehead. “Known 
for its discriminating tastes.” 

“Now, about the matter of a

aee no neet of oztentation. A mere 
thousant a day would suvvize as a 
token of Corps czteem.” 

“A thousand what a day?” The 
ambassador inquired around a fro- 
zen diplomatic grm which exposed 
old-fashioned removable dentures. 

“Credits, of gourse. And then 
there is the matter of zupzidies to 
Hoogan industry; zay vivty thou- 
sant a month. Ton’d give a thoughd 
to atminisdration; just make the 
cheggs payaWe to me perzonally — ” 
“Hoogan industry? But I was giv- 
en to understand there are no in- 
dustries here on Hoog.” 

“That’s why we reguire a zup- 
zidy,” the Bishop said blandly. 

Straphanger hitched his smile in 
place with an effort. 

“Your Arrogance, I’m here mere- 
ly to establish friendly relations, to 
bring Hoog into the mainstream of 
Galactic cultural life — ” 

“What coult be frientlier than 
money?” the Bishop inquired in a 
loud, final-sounding voice. 

“Well,” Straphanger conceded, 
“we might arrange a loan — ” 

“An oudright krant iz zo much 
zimpler,” the Bishop pointed out. 

“Of course, it would mean extra 
staff, to handle the administrative 
load.” Straphanger rubbed his hands 
together, a speculative gleam in his 
eye. “Say twenty-five for a start.” 
The Bishop turned as a medium- 
sized Hoog in tight, black and silver 
vestments came up, growled in his 
ear and waved a rubbery arm to- 
ward the house. 

“What?” the Bishop exploded. He 
swivelled on Straphanger. “You are 
harporink tapoo greatures? Givink 



aid and gomfort to untesirable ele- 
ments? Sharink your zubstanze with 
minions of the opposition?” 

Arrogance!” Straphang- 
er’s voice quavered against 
the rising roar of the outraged cleric. 
“I don’t understand! What did that 
fellow say?” 

The Bishop bawled commands in 
Hoogan. His escort scattered and 
began beating the bushes which rim- 
med the garden. The ambassador 
trotting at his side, the guest of hon- 
or strode to the laden refreshment 
tables, and began stuffing in fragile 
china, muttering to himself. 

“Your Arrogance,” Straphanger 
panted. “If I could just have some 
explanation! I’m sure it’s all just 
a ghastly mistake! What are these 
men searching for? I assure you — ” 
“Out of the gootnezz of my heart 
I welgomed you to Hoog!” the 
Bishop roared. “As a great gompli- 
ment to you, I abzorbed your langu- 
age! I was even ready to agzept 
cash, the zubreme chesture! And 
now I find that you openly gonzort 
with the enemies of the Kods!” 
Standing on the sidelines of the 
verbal fray. Relief glanced around 
the garden. He spotted a fountain 
in the shape of a two-headed 
Hoogan dwarf with oversized teeth 
and belly, and moved over to it. 

There was a tug at his sandal 
lace. He looked down. Two bright 
eyes at the ends of wirelike stalks 
stared up appealingly from a clump 
of grass. He glanced around — all 
eyes were on the Bishop. 

“Arc you looking for me?” Relief 
asked softly.

“Right!” a squeaky voice piped. 
•You’re a hard man to have a quiet 
•hat with, Mr. ahh.” 

“Retief.” 

“How do, Retief. My name’s 
Jackspurt. The boys appointed me 
^okesman to tell you Terries about 
what’s going on. After all, I guess 
118 Spism’s got a few rights, too.” 

“If you can explain what’s going 
an in this filbert factory. I’ll be for- 
ever in your debt, Jackspurt. Speak 
your piece.” 

“It’s the Hoogans; they don’t give 
HI a minute’s peace. Talk about 
persecution! Do you know those 
OBalm-singing hippos are blaming us 
lor everything from sour milk to 
loss of potency? It’s getting where 
Ws not safe to take a stroll after 
sundown.” 

“Hold on, Jackspurt. Maybe 
jFou’d better fill me in on some 
background. Who are you? Why are 
the Hoogans after you? And where 
did you learn to speak Terran with 
that flawless enunciation of con- 
sonants?” 

CiT used to be a mascot on a Ter- 
X ry trader; I stowed away 
when she landed here for emergency 
acpairs. It was a great life; but after 
a wjiile I got homesick for good 
old Hoog — ' you know how it is — ” 
“You’re a native of this charming 
world?” 

“Sure — us Spism’s have been 
around longer than the Hoogs. And 
wc got along for thousands of years 
with no trouble. The Hoogs took the 
surface, and we settled in nice and 
•omfy underground. Then they got 
religion and it’s been hell ever since.” 



“Hold on, Jackspurt. I always 
heard that religion exercised a bene- 
ficent influence on those fortunate 
enough to possess it.” 

“That depends on which side 
you’re on.” 

“That’s a point.” 

“But I haven’t given you the big 
picture yet. These Hoogan priests 
launched a full-scale propaganda 
campaign — painted up a lot of re- 
ligious art with pictures of Spisms 
poking pitchforks at Hoogs, and 
pretty soon it got so even the aver- 
age Hoog in the street started jump- 
ing and making X’s in the air and 
mumbling spells everytime one of us 
came up for a breath of fresh air. 
The next thing we knew, it was full- 
scale war! I’m telling you, Retief, 
us Spisms are in bad shape — and 
it’s gotta get worse!” 

A guard was working his way to- 
ward the ogre fountain. 

“Jiggers, the gendarmes,” Retief 
said. “You’d better get out of sight, 
Jackspurt. They’re beating the 
bushes for you. Why don’t we con- 
tinue this later.” 

The Spism whisked back under 
cover. “But this is important, Re- 
tief!” Jackspurt’s voice emanated 
from the brush. “The boys are 
counting on me.” 

“Shh! Watch me and take your 
cue.” 

Magnan had turned and was eye- 
ing Retief suspiciously. He stepped 
to his junior’s side. 

“Retief, if you’re mixed up in this 
mix-up . .” 

“Me, Mr. Magnan? Why, I just 
arrived this afternoon the same time 
you did.”

*‘Magnan!” Straphanger’s voice 
cut through ihe hubbub. “The 
Bishop informs me that some sort 
of demonic creature was seen here 
on the Embassy grounds this eve- 
ning! Of course we know nothing 
about it, but His Arrogance has 
drawn the unfortunate implication 
that we’re consorting with denizens 
of the netherworld!” He lowered his 
voice as Magnan drew close. “Su- 
perstitious poppycock, but we’ve got 
to play along. You and the others 
spread out and go through a show 
of looking for this mythical imp. 
I’ll pacify His Arrogance.” 

44^ertainly, Mr. Ambassador. But 
. ah . what if we find 
it?” 

“Then you’re an even greater idiot 
than I suspect!” Straphanger twist- 
ed his working smile into position 
and turned back to the Bishop. 

“Relief, you start along there,” 
Magnan indicated the front of the 
house. “I’ll go poke about in the 
bushes. And whatever you do, don’t 
turn up anything — like that ghast- 
ly creature we encountered up- 
stairs.” A startled look spread across 
his face. “Good Lord, Relief! Do 
you suppose — ?” 

“Not a chance. I picture some- 
thing more like a medium-sized 
dragon.” 

“Still . perhaps I’d better men- 
tion it to the. ambassador.” 

“And confirm the Bishop’s opin- 
ion? Very courageous of you. Mind 
tf I stick around and watch?” 

“On the other hand, he’s a busy 
man,” Magnan said hurriedly. “Af- 
ter all, why bother him with triv- 



ia?” He hurried off to take up a 
position near the Bishop and make 
a show of stooping and peering 
among the conifer-like hedges. 

Relief sauntered back to the table, 
deserted now except for a lone 
Hoogan bearer at the far end gather- 
ing empties onto a wide tray and 
tossing damp paper napkins into a 
capacious waste-paper receptacle. 
Relief picked up an empty sandwich 
plate, said “hsst!” The Hoogan look- 
ed up as Relief tossed the plate, 
dropped the big paper bag and 
caught the tossed crockery. 

44 T Tere’s some more,” Relief of- 

-tX fered helpfully. He gather- 
ed up and handed over a pair of 
saucers, three empty glasses and a 
couple of cheese sandwiches each 
minus one bite. “You’d better hump 
along now and police up behind His 
Arrogance,” he suggested. “He’s 
leaving a trail of saucer rims be- 
hind him — doesn’t seem to like the 
floral design.” 

“You dry dell me my chop?” the 
Hoogan demanded truculently as 
Relief fumbled a spoon and let it 
drop to the grass just under the 
edge of the hanging table cloth. 

“Certainly not, old boy,” Retid! 
reassured the glowering local. He 
stopped for the spoon, caught a 
glimpse of an eye peering from the 
shadows. 

‘‘Get in the bag,” he hissed from 
the comer of his mouth. 

“Who you talg to?” the servant 
ducked and stared under the table. 
Behind him, the paper-trash con- 
tainer rustled softly as the Spism 
whisked into it

“Just addressing a few words to 
the spoon god,” Relief said bland- 
ly. “Bad luck to drop a spoon, you 
know.” 

“Yes?” the Hoogan said. He 
leaned against the table, got out a 
much-used toothpick and began 
plying it on his unpolished teeth. 
“You voreigners kot grazy iteas. 
Efrypoty know kood lug trob sboon, 
bat lug trob forg.” He carefully ex- 
amined the tip of the toothpick. 

“Back home, falling from a ten- 
story building is considered an in- 
auspicious omen,” Relief rambled 
on, watching the armed Episcopal 
Guards as they worked closer. One 
came over to the table, gave Relief 
a sharp look, thrust his head un- 
der the table, and then reached 
down to check the paper-trash con- 
tainer. 

“How about a little refreshment?” 
Relief picked up a cup, dipped it 
full from a bowl of thick purple 
punch, took a step toward the war- 
rior and seemed to trip; the sticky 
fluid struck the Hoogan just below 
the clasp holding the rainbow-hued 
cape, spread out in an interesting 
pattern across his polished breast- 
plate. The bearer grabbed up his 
tray and bag and backed off hur- 
riedly as the spluttering guard slap- 
ped limber fingers at the purple 
mess. 

“Itiot! Clumpsy oaf!” he choked 
angrily. 

“What? Boozink on tudy?” a vast 
voice boomed. The Bishop bellied 
past Relief, planted himself before 
the confused Hoogan. “The benalty 
is boilink in oil!” he roared. “Take 
him away!”

O ther guardsmen closed in and 
grabbed their unfortunate fel- 
low. 

“That was my fault. Your Ar- 
rogance,” Relief started. “I offered 
him — ” 

“You would inderfere with the 
Ebiscobal administration of justize?” 
the Bishop bellowed, turning on Re- 
tief. “You have the demerity to sug- 
chest that the Ebiscobal judgment 
is fallible?” 

“Not exactly; you’re just wrong,” 
Relief said. “I spilled the punch on 
him.” 

The Bishop’s face purpled; his 
mouth worked. He swallowed. 

“It’s ben zo long zinze anyone 
condratieded me,” he said mildly, 
“that I’ve vorkotten tibe bunish- 
ment.” He waved two fingers in 
blessing. “You are apzolved, my 
zon,” he said airily. “In vact, I 
apzolv you for the whole weekent. 
Have fun; it’s on the house.” 

“Why, isn’t that gracious of His 
Arrogance,” Magnan chirped, pop- 
ping up beside the Bishop. “What a 
pity we didn’t find the demon; but 
I—” 

“That reminds me,” the Bishop 
said ominously. He fixed an eye on 
Ambassador Straphanger as die 
senior diplomat came up. “I’m still 
waitink for results!” 

“Look here. Your Arrogance! 
How can we find a demon if there’s 
no demon here?” 

“That’s your broblem!” 

There was a yell from the gate. 
Two guards were man-handling the 
bearer with the waste-paper bag,

who jerked away, making indignant 
noises. The bag fell, split open, 
spilling garbage from the midst of 
which the fugitive Spism burst, send- 
ing scraps flying in every direction. 

With a bound, it was past the 
astonished guards and heading for 
the rear gate. More guards appear- 
ed in its path, jerking long-barrelled 
guns from tooled holsters. A shot 
seared a long gouge in the deep 
grass, narrowly missing other Epis- 
copal retainers dashing up to get a 
crack at the action. The Bishop 
yelled, waving his boneless arms. 

C ut off, the Spism veered, dashed 
from the house, but was met 
by a squad charging out from in- 
side. A near-miss smashed dishes on 
the table behind Magnan, who yelp- 
ed and hit the dirt. 

The Spism skittered, took evasive 
action, headed for the flower-deck- 
ed gate letting out onto the drive. 
The guards were all behind it now, 
the way clear. With a tremendous 
yell, Bishop Ai-Poppy-Googy whip- 
ped his giant sword out and leaped 
to intercept the fleeing creature. As 
he bounded past Retief, the latter 
pivoted, and thrust out a foot. He 
hooked the Espiscopal leg just above 
a flare-topped, bejeweled pink lea- 
ther shoe. His Arrogance dived for- 
ward, struck medals-first, and skid- 
ded on his face under the table. 

‘‘Why, hi there,” Magnan’s voice 
piped under the muffling canopy of 
the drooping tablecloth. “Just a min- 
ute, and FU scroonch over — ” 

Tlie Bishop roared and rose up, 
the table lifting with him; dishes, 
glasses, and food cascaded off on 



Magnan, who was still crouching on 
the groimd. With a surge, the Bishop 
hurled the board aside and roared 
again, while whirling to confront the 
dancing figure of Ambassador Strap- 
hanger, \^o flapped a napkin at the 
mud on the ornate conicals of the 
guest of honor. 

“Treazonl" Ai-Poppy-Googy bel- 
lowed. “AzzazzintsI Murderers! Ach- 
ents of the Unterworlt! Obstructors

“Now, now. Your Arrogance! 
Don’t get upset — ” 

“Upzet! This iz maybe a choke?” 
The Bishop dashed the muddied 
cloth from Straphanger’s hand. He 
bent down, snatched up his sword 
and waved it overhead. The Episco- 
pal Guard was closing in quickly 
now. 

“I hereby eggsgommunigate the 
lot of you!” the Bishop yelled. “No 
food, no water, no bolice brotec- 
tionl Alzo, you will be puplicly egg- 
secuted! Boys, round zem up!” 
Guns were suddenly leveled at the 
huddle of diplomats surrounding 
the ambassador. Magnan yelped. 
Straphanger’s wattles quivered. 

“Ton’d miss this one!” Ai-Poppy- 
Googy indicated Retief. “It was hds

gun into Retief s side.

“Kood! I herepy grant you an

“Dake them away, poys!” 

“Ah . I’m grateful for the par- 
don, I’m sure,” Straphanger said, 
gaining confidence rapidly; “but of 
course I won’t be able to process the 
paper work properly without my 
staff.” 

Ai-Poppy-Googy glared with large, 
damp red eyes. “All right! Keep 
them! They’re all rebrieved egzebd 
thad one!” He aimed a finger at 
Relief like a gun. “I have sbezial 
blans for him!” the guards shifted 
their attention to Relief ringing him 
in with aimed guns. 

“Maybe His Arrogance would be 
just a teeny bit lenient this time,” 
Magnan suggested, dabbing at a 
smear of liver paste along his bare 



arm, “if Mr. Relief apologized and 
promised never to do it again.” 

“Do whad akain?” the Bishop de- 
manded. 

“Trip you,” Magnan said. “You 
know, like he did just now.” 

“He dribbed me?” Ai-Poppy- 
Googy choked. “On burpose?” 
“Why, ah, it must have been a 
mistake — ” Straphanger started. 

“Your Arrogance has such a keen* 
sense of humor. I’m sure you’ll sec 
the comic aspect of it, if you just 
think about it,” Magnan offered. 

“Relief! Did you — I mean, sure- 
ly you didn’t.” Straphanger choked. 

“Well!” Magnan said indignantly. 
“I was lying right there.” 

“Zearch him!” the Bishop bel- 
lowed. Guards jumped forward; 
busy hands grabbing at Reliefs kilt- 
pockets, almost at once came upon 
the folded paper the Spism had 
dropped as it fled his room. 

“Ah-hah!” the Bishop pounced. 
He opened the paper and read the 
message. 

“A gonsbirazy!” he yelled. “Un- 
ter my very nose! Put the ironts on 
him!” 

44T must protest!” Straphanger 
X spoke up. “You can’t go about

“The Kods will nod be denied

“Domorrow is the Krant Vestifal of

“Tomorrow’s Thursday,” Magnan 
interjected.

Now, as I was sayink — this Der-

“Oh, he’ll be taking part in a 
ceremony!” Straphanger said in a 
relieved tone. “Well, goodness, I 
suppose we can spare him long 
enough for that.” He offered a small 
diplomatic chuckle. “The Corps is 
always ready to promote worship 
in whatever form, of course.” 

“The only drue Kods are the

Bishop boomed. “Any more of your

“Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan qua- 
vered, tugging at Straphanger’s arm, 
“do you think you should allow 
them — ” 

“Merely letting His Arrogance 
save face,” Straphanger said in a 
confidential tone. He winked at Re- 
lief. “Don’t worry, my boy; good 
experience for you. You’ll get an 
inside view of the Hoogan religions 
concept at work!” 

“But — but, what if they ... I 
mean, boiling in oil is so perma-

“Quiet, Magnan! I’ll have no 
whiners in my organization!” 

“Thanks for thinking of me, Mr. 
Magnan,” Relief said. “I still have 
my good-luck charm.” 

“Charm?” Magnan looked blank. 



“Witchgraft?” the Bishop boom- 
ed. “I zuzbegted as much!” He turn- 
ed a large, red eye on Straphanger. 

“I’ll pe zeeing you at the zerc- 
mony! Ton’d pe lade!” He eyed Re- 
tief. “Are you goming beazevully?” 
“In view of the number of guns 
aimed at me,” Relief said, “I sin-

V 

r ie cell was narrow, dark, damp, 
and unfurnished except for a 
plain table with a bottle of bitter- 
smelling wine and a narrow bendi 
on which Relief sat. His wrists were 
chained together, and he was listen- 
ing to a muffled tapping whidi 
sounded faintly from beyond the 
walls. It had been going on now for 
twelve hours, he estimated — long 
enough for the Hoogans to have 
completed their preparations for the 
religious ceremonies in which he 
was to play a part. 

The tapping abruptly changed 
tone and sounded louder, nearer. 
There was a light clatter, as of 
pebbles tossed on the floor. A mo- 
ment later, there was a soft scraping 
sound, a rasping like fingernails on 
a blackboard; then silence. 

“Relief, are you there?” a this 
voice chirped through the pitdi 
darkness. 

“Sure, Jackspurt! Come on ki 
and join the pjuty. I’m glad to see 
you eluded the gendarmes.” 

“Those slobs! Hah. But listen. Re- 
lief, I’ve got bad news.” 

“Press on, Jackspurt; I’m listen-

Googy’s scheduled the big all-out 
push for today, to tie in with the 
miimbo-jumbo. The Hoogs have 
been building this king-size fumiga- 
toi for months — stacking it full of 
rubbish, old rags, worn-out tires, 
and what not. At the height of the 
big ceremony they set the stuff on 
fire and start the smoke-pumps go- 
ing. They got a system of pipes laid 
out leading into the burrows, see? 
There won’t be a safe spot for 
Spisms for miles around. Our boys 
will come stampeding out of their 
hideaways, some of which have been 
in the family for generations, and 
zowie! the Bishop’s troops lower the 
boom! It’ll be the finish of us 
Spisms!” 

“That’s a heart-rending story, 
JaeV spurt — or it would be, if I 
weren’t in such a heart-rending posi- 
tion myself at the moment.” 

“Yeah, the Wednesday Rites. You 
scheduled for the matinee or the 
big evening spectacular?” Jackspurt 
broke off as clankings sounded from 
beyond the door. 

“Holy Moses, Relief! Time’s up! 
They’re here! Listen, I was sup- 
posed to brief you in, like, but it 
took longer’n I figured tunneling 
through that wall, and then I got 
to yakking — ” 

A key scraped in the keyhole. 

“Listen! Did you drink any of 
what’s in the bottle?” 

“No.” 

“Good! It’s doped! When I leave, 
dump it! You’ll have to pretend you 
can’t talk or the jig’s up! Put on a 
kind of zombie routine, see? What- 
ever they tell you — do it! If they 
get the idea you’re putting some- 



thing over, it’s zkkk! for every Ter- 
ry on Hoog! And remember! Keep 
your head down and your arms and 
legs tucked in — ” 

The lock turned with a rasp of 
rusty tumblers. 

“Gotta go! Good luck!” Jack- 
spurt scrambled and was gone. 

R elief took a step, grabbed up the 
bottle, poured it down the 
three-inch hole through which his 
visitor had fled. 

Light blazed as the heavy door 
swung inward. Three hooded Hoog- 
an pikemen came into the cell, fol- 
lowed by a black-robed priest. Re- 
lief stood holding the empty bottle, 
his body concealing Jackspurt’s es- 
cape route. 

“How to you veel, Derry?” the 
priest inquired, looking Relief over. 
He stepped in, thumbed Reliefs 
eyelid up, grunted, and took the 
empty bottle from his hand. 

“Goked to the eyeprows,” he 
stated. 

“Arc you zure?” a pikeman chal- 
lenged. “I ton’d drust these voreign- 
ers.” 

“Nadurally I’m zure; the hyper- 
vasgulations of the subraoccibital 
whatchamagallids is dypical; a glas- 
sic gase. Dake him alonk.” 

Hemmed in by pikes, Relief fol- 
lowed along a torch-lit passage, up 
winding stone stairs, to emerge 
abruptly into blinding light and the 
susurrus of a multitude of voices, 
above which one rose like the boom 
of surf:

Squinting against the sudden sun- 
light, Retief made out the resplend- 
cntly robed figure of the Bishop, 
seated under a vast parasol on a 
massive throne of dark wood carved 
with designs of intertwined serpents. 
He was flanked on the left by the 
Terran Ambassador and on the right 
by a huddle of lesser diplomates. 
The group was ringed in by stony- 
faced Hoogan guards with bared 
scimitars. 

The priest who had accompanied 
Retief bowed unctiously before the 
Episcopal throne. ‘‘Your Arrokanze, 
the 2^n-to-pe-Alefated One is 
here,” he indicated Retief with a 
wave of the hand. 

“Is he ... ah .. 7” Ai-Poppy- 
Googy looked inquiringly at the es- 
cort. 

“A glassig gase of hypervasgula- 
tions of the thinkamapops,” a pike- 
man spoke up. 

“Foil thad one in oil,” the Bishop 
said, frowning. “He dalgs doo 
mudge.” 

“You appear a bit peaked. Re- 
lief,” Straphanger commented. “I 
trust you slept well last night? Com- 
fortable quarters and all that?” 

Retief stared absently past the 
ambassador’s left ear. 

“Retief, the ambassador’s address- 
ing you,” Magnan said sharply. 



“Brobably he's losd in metita- 
tions,” Ai-Poppy-Googy said hastily. 
“On with the zeremony.” 

“Perhaps he’s sick,” Magnan said. 
“Here, you’d better sit down.” 
“Ah-ah,” Ai-Poppy-Googy held 
up a limber hand. “The mosd im- 
bortand bortion of the zeremony 
yed remaints to pe zeleprated.” 
“Ah, yes, of course,” Straphang- 
er sat back. “I’d quite forgotten, 
Your Arrogance.” He glanced 
around. “We’ll have a magnificent 
view of the proceedings from here.” 
At a prod from an Episcopal 
Guard, Retief turned — and found 
himself staring directly into the vast 
brass smile of the Hoogan idol. 

F rom Retiefs elevated viewpoint 
atop the two-hundred foot high 
ziggurat, the head of the god rear- 
ed up another fifty feet. It was an 
immense stylized Hoogan face of 
polished yellow metal, the vast hand 
upraised beside it. The eyes were 
deep hollows at the back of which 
a sullen red glow gave an impres- 
sion of malignant intelligence. The 
noseholes, a yard each in diameter, 
drooled a thin trickle of smoko 
which coiled up past soot-streaked 
cheeks to dissipate in the clear air. 
The mouth which split the massive 
head, gaped in a crocodile smile set 
with spade-shaped teeth with spaces 
between them beyond which was 
visible a curve of polished esopha- 
gus agleam with leaping reflections 
from inner fires below. 

Two lesser priests stepped for- 
ward to hang assorted ornaments on 
Retiefs shoulders and neck. Anoth- 
er taking up a position before him.

intoned a repetitious chant. Some- 
where, drums commenced a slow 
tattoo. A murmur passed over the 
crowd packing the slopes of the 
ziggurat and the plaza below. Stand- 
ing at ease, apparently ignoring his 
surroundings, Retief noted a two- 
foot wide trough cut in the stone 
platform at his feet, deepening and 
slanting down as it ran to the abrupt 
drop-off ten yards distant. An aco- 
lyte was busy pouring oil into the 
hollow and spreading it with swipes 
of his hands. 

‘‘Just what does this phase of the 
ceremonial involve?” Straphanger 
inquired in a tone of synthetic dip- 
lomatic interest. 

“Waid and zee,” Ai-Poppy-Googy 
said shortly. 

“Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan whis- 
pered hoarsely. “His hands are 
chained!” 

“Part of the ceremony, no doubt.” 
“And that groove,” Magnan went 
on. “It runs from Retief right over 
to the edge . just above that 
horrible ig-bay outh-may.” 

“Yes, yes, you needn’t play the 
part of a tourist guide, Magnan. By 
the way,” Straphanger lowered his 
voice, “you didn’t happen to bring 
along a hip flask, I suppose?” 
“Why, no, Mr. Ambassador. I 
have a nice antiviral nasal spray, if 
that would help. But about that 
chute — ” 

44Tl^arm, isn’t it. Your Arro- 
▼ ▼ gance?” Straphanger turn- 
ed to the Bishop. “A bit dry, too.” 
“You ton’d lige our Hoogan 
weather?” the Bishop asked in an 
ominous tone. 



“No, no, it’s fine. I love it when 
it’s nice and hot and dry.” 

“Ah, Your Arrogance,” Magnan 
spoke up. “Just what is it you have 
in mind doing with Retief?” 

“Iz kreat honor,” the Bishop said. 

“I’m sure we’re all delighted at 
this opportunity for one of onr 
group to get an inside view of the 
Hoogan religious philosophy,” Strap- 
hanger said sharply. “Now kindly 
sit down and stop that infernal 
chattering,” he added behind his 
hand. 

The Bishop was speaking quickly 
in Hoogan; the attendant priests 
urged Retief forward a step, grasp- 
ed his arms and deftly placed him 
face-down in the oiled channel. The 
rattle of the drums rose to a cres- 
cendo. Flabby Hoogan hands shoved 
Retief forward down the steepening 
slope. 

“Mr. Ambassador!” Magnan’s 
voice rose to a shrill bleat. “I do be- 
lieve they’re feeding him to that 
monster!” 

“Nonsense, Magnan!” Straphang- 
er’s suety voice countered. “It’s all 
symbolic, I’m sure. And I might 
point out that you’re hardly con- 
ducting yourself like a seasoned 
diplomat.” 

“Stop!” Retief, sliding rapidly to- 
ward the edge, heard Magnan’s yelp 
and the scuffle of rapid footsteps. 

There was a wet splat! and bony 
elbows slammed against him. He 
twisted, caught a glimpse of Mag- 
nan’s white face, open mouth and 
clutching hands as together they 
shot over the edge and out in a 
graceful arc toward the waiting jaws 
of Uk-Ruppa-Tooty. 




VI 

K eep your arms and legs tucked 
in, Jackspurt had said; Relief 
bad time to grit his teeth — then he 
was hurtling past the tombstone- 
sized fangs, Magnan’s hands still 
clutehing his legs. They dropped 
down into a blast of searing heat and 
light, then suddenly, stunningly, they 
slammed against and through a 
yielding, shredding network of fila- 
ments as fine as spiderwebs. Relief 
came to a stop, rebounded, 
caught at a heavier cable that brush- 
ed his hand, and was clinging to a 
coarse rope ladder, Magnan’s weight 
dangling from his heels. 

“Bullseye!” a tiny voice screeched 
almost in his ear. “Now let’s get out 
of here fast, before they dope out 
what happened!” 

Relief found a foothold in the 
snarl of rope, reached down and 
hauled the rag-limp second secretary 
to his side. The heat from below 
was scorching, even here in the 
shelter of a bulge in the god’s 
throat. 

“Wha-what-bu-bu — ” Magnan 
babbled, groping for a handhold. 

“Hurry up, Retiefi” Jackspurt 
urged. “Up here by the tonsils! It’s 
a secret passage!” 

Relief assisted Magnan in scram- 
bling up. He boosted him into the 
narrow, circular burrow that ran 
back through the solid metal. The 
Spism in the lead, they moved hur- 
riedly away from the sound of 
priestly voices raised in puzzled in- 
quiry, reached a set of cramped 
steps leading down. 

“We’re okay now,” Jackspurt 



said. “Take a breather, and then 
we’ll go down and meet the boys.” 
Later they were in a cavern floOT- 
ed with rough masonry, and lit by 
a burning wick afloat in a shallow 
bowl of aromatic oil. All around, 
twitching Spism eye-stalks stared al 
the intruders; the close-packed red 
goblin-forms of Jackspurt and his 
clan moved restlessly, like giant fid- 
dler crabs on some subterranean 
beach. Behind them, tall, pale-blue 
cousins poised on yard-long legs, 
watched from shadowy corners. In 
niches and crannies in the walls, 
tiny green Spisms and sluggish 
orange forms with white spots clung, 
gazing. Dark purple Spisms, dan- 
gling from the ceiling like tumor- 
ous stalactites, waved their free legs 
hypnotically, studying the scene. 

Magnan’s fingers dug into Retiefs 
arm. “G-great heavens, Retiefi” he 
gasped out. “You — you don’t sup- 
pose we’ve died and that my Aunt 
Minerva was right all along?” 

“Mr. Relief, meet the boys,” Jack- 
spurt clambered up to perch on a 
ledge overlooking the gathering. “A 
lot of them are pretty shy, but 
they’re a good-natured bunch, al- 
ways a thousand laughs. When they 
heard you was in trouble, they all 
joined in to help out.” 

44'^eli them Mr. Magnan and 
A I said thanks,” Relief said. 
“It was an experience we wouldn’t 
have missed. Right, Mr. Magnan?” 
“I’d certainly never miss it,” Mag- 
nan swallowed audibly. “H-how is 
it you can talk to these hobgoblins. 
Relief?” he hissed. “You haven’t 
. ah . made some sort of pact

with the powers o# darkness, 1 
trost?” 

“Hey, letief,” Jackspurt said. 
^Yoor 6fieiid got some kind of race 
prejudice or something?” 

“Heavens, no,” Magnan said in a 
strangled voice. “Some of my best 
friends are fiends — I mean, in our 
profession, one meets — ” 

“Mr. Magnan is just a little 
confused,” Retief put in. “He didn’t 
expect to be playing such an active 
role in today’s events.” 

“Speaking of active, we better get 
you gents, back to the surface fast,” 
lackspurt said. “The pumps will be 
starting up any minute now.” 
“Where are you going when the 
fumigation begins?” 

“We got an escape route mapped 
out through the sewers that ought 
to bring "US out in the clear a couple 
miles from town. We’re just hoping 
Ihe Hoog don’t have the outfall 
staked out.” 

“Where are these smoke pumps 
located?” Retief asked. 

“Up above — in Uk-Ruppa- 
Tooty’s bcRy.” 

“Who’s manaing them?” 

“A couple of priests. Why?” 
“How do we get there from 
here?” 

“Well, there’s a couple passages 
— but we bettw not waste any time 
ftght-seeing.” 

“Retief, ase you out of your 
mind?” Magnan blurted. “If the 
priests see us, our goose will be 
eooked, along with the rest of our 
anatomies I” 

“We’ll try to make it a point to 
see them first. Jackspurt, can you get 
a couple of doaea vc^unteers?” 



“You mean to climb up in that 
brass god? I don’t know, Retief. The 
fellas are pretty superstitious.” 

“We need them to make a diver- 
sion while Mr. Magnan and I carry 
out the negotiation — ” 

“Who, me?” Magnan squeaked. 
“Negotiation?” Jackspurt protest- 
ed. “Jumping Jehosophat, how can 
you negotiate with a Hoog?” 

“Ahem,” Magnan cleared his 
throat. “That, Mr. Jackspurt, is af- 
ter all one’s function as a diplomat.” 
“Well . .” Jackspurt buzzed 
briefly to his fellows, then hopped 
down from his perch as a dozen 
Spisms of assorted sizes and colors 
came forward. 

“We’re game, Mr. Retief. Let’s 
go!” 

T he dull gleam of the metal walls 
of the vast chamber that was 
the interior of the god Uk-Ruppa- 
Tooty loomed out of dense shadow 
where Retief and Magnan crouched 
with their hobgoblin crew. At the 
center of the gloomy chamber, low- 
caste Hoogans labored before the 
open door of a giant, red-glowing 
furnace, tossing in armloads of rub- 
bish, old shoes, bundled magazines, 
and broken plastic crockery. A lay- 
er of harsh, eye-watering smoko 
hung in the air. Jackspurt snorted. 

“Boy, when they start pumping 
that stuff into the burrows . .” 
“Where are the priests?” Retief 
inquired in a whisper. 

Jackspurt pointed to a small cubi- 
cle at the top of a flight of steps. 
“Up there, in the control room.” 
Retief studied the layout. “Jack- 
spurt, you and your men spread out 



122 




around the room. Give me five 
minutes. Then take turns jumping 
out and making faces.” 

Jackspurt gave instructions to his 
crew; they faded away into the dark- 
ness. 

“Maybe you’d better wait here,” 
Retief suggested to Magnan. 

“Where are you going?” 

“I think I’d better have a chat 
with the ecclesiaslics up in the 
prompting box.” 

“And leave me here alone, sur- 
rounded by these ghoulish Spisms?’' 
“All right, but keep it quiet or 
the smoke of burning diplomats will 
be added to the other fumes.” 
Fifty feet above the floor, Retief 
gripped narrow handholds, working 
his way around to the rear of the 
control box. Through the dusty win- 
dows a blue-robed Hoogan priest 
could be seen lounging in a bored 
attitude, studying a scroll. A second 
Hoogan, in the familiar black, stood 
nervously by. Suddenly the silence 
below was broken by a mournful 
wail. 

“What’s that!” Magnan jumped, 
slipped and grabbed for a secure 
grip on a projecting angle-iron sup- 
porting a narrow catwalk. 

“Our co-workers going into ac- 
tion.” Retief said softly. Beside the 
furnace door, the Hoogan workers 
were staring around nervously. 
There was another doleful moan. 
One of the Hoogans dropped his 
shovel and muttered. Retief ducked 
back as the blue-robed priest came 
to the window and peered down be- 
low. He then motioned to the other, 
who went to the door of the tiny 
chamber, opened it, stepped out on 



RETIEF, GOD-SPEAKER 



the catwalk and shouted down to 
the workers. One answered in de- 
fiant tones. Two of the workers 
started toward a door dimly visible 
at the far side of the furnace room. 
The priest shouted after them; as his 
bellow faded and echoed, the thin 
hoot of a Spism sounded, like the 
last wail of dying hope. 

The priest jumped and whirled 
to dart back inside the control room. 
He slipped, fell from the catwalk 
and found himself staring directly 
into Magnan’s startled face. He 
opened his mouth to roar — 

M agnan whipped off his mauve 
cummerbund and thrust it 
into the gaping mouth. With a muf- 
fled grunt, the Hoogan lost his grip, 
fell, and slammed into the heaped 
rubbish with a tremendous slam. 
The stokers fled, shouting. The lone 
priest flattened his face against the 
window, peering down into the 
gloom. With a quick movement, Re- 
tief gained the catwalk, and stepped 
through the door. The priest whirl- 
ed and leaped for a microphone-like 
device on the corner table. Retief 
cased the power pistol from his 
sarong and aimed it at the priest. 

*T wouldn’t make any announce- 
ments just yet,” he said. ‘‘The re- 
sults aren’t all in.” 

“Who are you?” The Hoogan 
sidled toward a corner cabinet. 

“If that’s where you keep your 
prayer books, better let them lie for 
a while yet.” 

“Look here, berhabs you are un- 
aware thad I am His Voracity, the 
Deacon Um-Moomy-Hooby, ant I 
have gonnegtions — ” 



“Doubtless. And don’t try for the 
door; I have a confederate out there 
who’s noted for his ferocity,” Re- 
tief said. 

Magnan came through the door, 
panting. Um-Moomy-Hooby backed 
away. 

“Whad — whad do you wand?” 

“I understand the god is about to 
utter oracular statements, as the 
high point of the Wednesday ser- 
vices,” Retief said. 

“Yez — I waz jusd goink over my 
sgribt. Now if you’ll eggsguze me 
I have to — ” 

“It just happens that it’s the script 
we want to talk about. There are a 
couple of special announcements Td 
like to see inserted.” 

“Whad? Damper with holy sgrib- 
ture?” 

“Nothing like that; just a good 
word for a group of associates of 
ours and possibly a short commer- 
cial for the CDT.” 

“Plasphemy! Herezy! Refishion- 
izm! Nefer will I pe a barty to zuch 
zagrilechel” 

Retief clicked off the ^toTs 
safety catch. 

“ — Put, on the other hant, bos- 
siply somethink gould pe arranch- 
ed,” the Deacon said hastily. “How 
much did you hafe in mind offer- 
ink?” 

“I wouldn’t think of attempting 
to bribe a man of the cloth,” Retief 
said smoothly. “You’re going to do 
this for the common welfare.” 

“Jusd whad is it you hafe in 
mind?” 

“The first item is the campaign 
you’ve been waging against die 
Spisms.”

“The CDT takes a dim view of

thought was that we could agree on 
a reasonable division of spheres of 
influence.” 

“A teal with the Bowers of Tark- 
nezz? Are you oud of your mind?” 
“Now, now,” Magnan put in, “a 
more cooperative attitude would do 
Your Voracity greater credit.” 
“You zugchesd that the jurch 
should gombromize with zin?” 

“Not exactly compromise,” Mag- 
nan said placatingly. “Just work out 
a sort of peaceful coexistence plan.” 
“Nefer will I, as deacon, gome 
oud in vafor of dogetherness with 
Zatan’z Impz!” 

“There, there, Your Voracity; if 
you’d just sit down across the table 
from them, you’d find these imps 
weren’t bad fellows at all.” 

There was a soft sound from the 
door. Jackspurt, a jaunty, two-foot 
sphere of red bristles, appeared, 
waving his eyestalks exultantly. A 
looming blue Spism behind him. 

“Nice going. Relief!” he called. 
“I see you caught one. Pitch him 
down after the other one, and let’s 
dear out of here This little diver- 
sion will give us time to get clear 
before the smoke starts.” 

“Jackspurt, do you suppose your 
fellows could do a fast job of shift- 
ing a few hoses around? You’H 
have to block off the sewers and 
feed the smoke off in some other 
direction.” 



“Say, that’s an idea!” Jackspurt 
agreed. “And I think I know just 
the direction.” He gave instructions 
to the big blue Spism, who hurried 
away. 

The Deacon had retreated to a 
corner, eyes goggling, his hands de- 
scribing mystic passes in the air. 
More Spisms were crowding into 
the room now, tall blue ones, tiny 
darting green ones, sluggish purple 
varieties — all cocking their eye- 
stalks at the prelate. 

“Help!” he croaked weakly. “The 
minions of the netherworlt are ubon 
me!” 

M agnan drew out a chair from 
the table. “Just have a seat. 
Your Voracity,” he said soothingly. 
“Let’s just see if we can’t work out 
a modus vivendi suitable to all par- 
ties.” 

“Come to termz with the enemy? 
Id will mean the ent of the jurch!” 
“On the contrary. Your Voracity; 
if you ever succeeded in eliminating 
the opposition, you’d be out of a 
job. The problem is merely to ar- 
range matters in a civilized fashion 
so that everyone’s interests are pro- 
tected.” 

“You may hafe somethink there,” 
Um-Moomy-Hooby seated himself 
gingerly. “But the nevariouz agtiri- 
ties of these goplins musd pe kebt

“Look, my boys got to make a

“The zame goez vor sdealing 
withoud a licenze, and the zale of 
algoholic peferaches, with the eg- 
gzebtion of small amounts of bro- 
berly aged sduff for medicinal use 
py the glerchy, of gourse.” 

“Okay, I think we can go along 
with that,” Jackspurt said. “But you 
priests will have to lay off the pro- 
paganda from now on. I want to 
see Spisms getting better billing in 
church art.” 

“Oh, I think you could work out 
something lovely in little winged 
Spisms with haloes,” Magnan sug- 
gested. “I think you owe it to them. 
Your Voracity, after all this dis- 
crimination in the past.” 

“Tevils with winks?” Um-Moomy- 
Hooby groaned. “It wiM blay hop 
with our zympolizmz — put I zub- 
boze it can pe done.” 

“And you’ll have to have guar- 
antees that everything from two feet 
under the surface on down belongs 
to us,” Jackspurt added. “We% 
leave the surface to you, and throw 
in the atmosphere, just so you dedi- 
cate a few easements so we can 
come up and sightsee now and 
then.” 

“Thad zeems egwidaple,” the 
Deacon agreed. “Supchegd to vinal 
abbrofal py His Arrokanze, of 
gourze.” 

“By the way,” Jackspurt asked 
casually, “who’s next in line for the 
Bishop’s job if anything happens to 
Ai-Poppy-Googy?” 

“Az it habbenz, I am,” Um- 
Moomy-Hooby said. ‘^Why?” 



“Just asking,” Jackspurt said. 

A loud thumping started up from 
the wide floor below. 

“What’s that?” Magnan yelled. 

“The pumps,” the Deacon said. 
“A bity so many Spisms will tie, but 
it is manivezdly the will of Uk- 
Ruppa-Tooty.” 

“I guess old Uk-Ruppa-Tooty had 
a last-minute change of heart,” 
Jackspurt said callously. “We shift- 
ed the pipes around to feed the 
fumes back up into the city plumb- 
ing system. I guess there’s black 
smoke pouring up out of every john 
in town by now.” 

“Touple-grozzer!” the Deacon 
leaped up, waving his arms. “The 
teal’z off — ” 

“Ah, ah, you promised. Your 
Voracity,” Magnan chided. “And 
besides, Mr. Retief still has a gun.” 

“And now, if you’ll just pick up 
the microphone. Your Voracity,” 
Retief said. “I think we can initiate 
the era of good feeling without fur- 
ther delay. Just keep our role quiet, 
and take all the credit for your- 
self.” 

VII 

44 A about poor Ai-Poppy- 

Googy falling off the zig- 
gurat when the smoke came boiling 
out of Uk-Ruppa-Tooty’s mouth,” 
Ambassador Straphanger said, fork- 
ing another generous helping of 
Hoogan chow mein onto his plate. 
“Still, one must confess it was a 
dramatic end for a churchman of 
his stature, shooting down the sHde 
and disappearing into the smoke as 
he did.”

“Yez, alreaty the canonization 
papers are peing brebared.” His 
newly installed Arrogance, Bishop 
Um-Moomy-Hoopy, shot a nervous 
glance at the Spism seated beside 
him. ^^He’ll pe the batron zaint of 
rehapilidated tevilz, impz, and kop- 

&1S.” 

“A pity you missed all the excite- 
ment, Magnan,” Straphanger said, 
diewing. “And you, too, Retief. 
While you absented yourselves, the 
Hoogan philosophy underwent a 
Yeri table renaissance — helped along, 
I humbly assume, by my modest 
peace-making efforts.” 

*‘Hah!” the Bishop muttered un- 
der his breath. 

“Frankly, what with all the 
smoke, I hadn’t expected the oracle’s 
pronouncement to be quite so lu- 
cid,” Straphanger went on, “to say 
nothing of its unprecedented gen- 
erosity — ” 

“Chenerosity?” interrupted Um- 
Moomy-Hoopy, his heavy features 
reflecting rapid mental recapitual- 
flon of his concessions. 

“Why, yes, ceding all mineral 
rights to the formerly persecuted 
race here on Hoog — a charming 
gesture of conciliation.” 

“Mineralts rightz? Whad miner- 
te?” 

Jackspurt, splendid in the newly 
tailored tunic of Chief Representa- 
tive for Spismodic Affairs to the 
Episcopal court, spoke up from his 
place along the table set up on the 
palace terrace. 

“Oh, he’s just talking about the 
deposits of gold, silver, platinum, 
indium, and uranium, plus a few 
Moulders of diamonds, ruby, and so 



forth that are laying around below 
ground. The planet’s lousy with the 
stuff. We’ll use our easements to 
ferry it up to the surface where the 
freighters will pick it up, so we 
won’t put you Hoogs out at all.” 

r ie Bishop’s alligator-hide fea- 
tures purpled. “You — you 
knew apout theze mineralts?” he 
choked. 

“Why, didn’t His former Arro- 
gance mention it to you? That was 
what brought the mission here; the 
routine minerals survey our techni- 
cal people ran from space last year 
showed up the deposits.” 

“Ant we puilt our Brincible Kod 
oud of prass — imborted prass at 
thad,” the Bishop said numbly. 

“Too scared of a few Spisms to 
dig,” Jackspurt said in a stage whis- 
per. 

There was a flicker of lightning 
in the sky to the cast. Thunder roll- 
ed. A large raindrop spattered on 
Straphanger’s plate, followed by an- 
other. 

“Oh-oh, we’d better head for cov- 
er,” Jackspurt said. “I know these 
flash squalls; lightning out the ka- 
zoo — 

A brilliant flash cast the looming 
figure of the god Uk-Ruppa-Tooty 
into vivid silhouette against a blue- 
black sky. Dishes rattled' on the 
table as sound rumbled across the 
sky on wooden wheels. The Bishop 
and his guests rose hastily, as a third 
jagged electrical discharge ripped 
across the sky — stricking the gianr 
idol full on the shoulder. 

A shower of sparks flew; the 
Hoogan gesture of salute, pi vote ! 




•lowly at the elbow. The yard«-wide 
liand, seen edge-on with the fingers 
extended, swung slowly in a great 
ere, came to rest with the extended 
thumb resting firmly against the 
tnub nose. Sparks flew as the digit 
was welded firmly in place. 

The Bishop stared, then tilted his 
head back and looked up at the sky, 
long and scarchingly. 

“Chusd pedween uz men of the 
worlt,” he said hoarsely, “do you 
zubboze thad phenomenon haz any 
•bezial zigniviganze?” 

“I think if I were you, Your Ar- 
rogance, Fd watch my ^p,” Jack- 
^urt said in an awed tone. “And, 
uh, by the way, on behalf of the 
Spisms, Fd Hkc to make a contribu- 



tion to the Episcopal treasury.” 
“Hmmm. Have you ever thought 
aboud tagink inzdruction?” the 
Bishop inquired. “Fm sure it could 
be arranged, and as for the little 
contribution you sboge of, dwenty 
bercend of the take would zuvvice.” 
They strolled off along the cor- 
ridor, deep in conversation. Ambas- 
sador Straphanger hurried away to 
prepare his dispatches to Sector 
HQ, Magnan at his heels. 

Retief stepped back out onto the 
terrace and lit up a dope-stitk. Far 
away, Uk-Ruppa-Tooty loomed, 
solemnly thumbing his nose at the 
Episcopal Palace. 

Cheerfully, Retief returned ttie 
salute. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

I have several comments to make 
on the December issue of If. 

1. The cover work was phenome- 
nal. Please let’s have some more 
like it. 

2. The Hounds of Hell was ex- 
cellent again. Please, more Laumer! 

3. Now comes the complaint: 
When is Doc Smith coming? YouVe 
been promising to have Skylark Du- 
Quesne soon for months. This was 
my original reason for subscribing 
(although Heinlein, Laumer and Van 
Vogt are good reasons too!) and it 
still is what I am waiting for! 

4. The Killing Machine by Jack 
Vance has just been published by 
Berkley Medallion — now you are 
planning to serialize it. WHY? Mags 
riiould have stories before they 
come out in book form, not after! 

You noticed no complaints on 
quality of your stories. I tried — 
but I couldn’t find anything to com- 
plain about! Please keep up the 
good work on the stories and keep 
Morrow for cover illustrations. — 



Martin Massoglia, 434 West Mc- 
Donel, Michigan State University, 
East Lansing Michigan. 

# Re Doc Smith: The first dralt of 
Skylark DuQuesne was completed 
last spring, and it’s a winner, too. 
One complication arose to prevent 
Doc from completing the revision 
on schedule: a little matter of some 
major surgery. The operation was 
one of those all-day jobs that take 
a team of surgeons working at top 
speeds, and average recovery time 
for a young adult usually runs to a 
matter of months . but Doc 
Smith, who is just beginning to get 
his second wind at 74, was up and 
out of the hospital in a week, back 
at work a few days later, and is now 
finishing up the rewrite. An amazing 
young fellow is this Doc Smith! 
We’re chary of predictions more 
than one issue ahead — sometimes 
even those go astray, as you see 
with Jack Vance’s story! — but as of 
this writing we fully expect to bring 
Skylark DuQuesne into the April 
issue.

An re The Killing Machine: We 
agree with every word you say . 
and that’s why the serial beginning 
this month is Starchild, When we 
bought The Killing Machine it was 
with the clear understanding that 
there would be no book publication 
for at least a year. Somewhere, 
somebody, somehow failed to get 
the message — the book edition 
came out — and at the last possible 
moment we had to pull the story 
out and replace it. (If you look close- 
ly at the cover you can see where 
the type was cut out and changed. 
In fact, the cover painting was made 
for The Killing Machine in the first 
place. Coincidentally, it happens to 
illustrate a scene in Starchild as well, 
proving that not all accidents are 
unlu.ky.) We liked The Killing Ma- 
chine . but we won’t be running 
it here . because we don*t use re- 
prints. Not even accidental ones. — 
♦ ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

That last serial that appeared in 
your magazine — The Hounds of 
Hell by Keith Laumer — is the 
most disgustingly ridiculous story 
you have ever printed. If one could 
forgive it for having almost no plot 
one still could not forgive it for 
being chock full of stock situations 
and incidents which appear over 
and over again almost word for 
word in various other stories. I mean, 
where is the author’s creativity? 
And why does he insist on cluttering 
up the story with trite sentences? 

The story read like something 
written in the thirties (or maybe the 
twenties). It was stocked wi^ sudi 
antiquities as the Superman Hero, 



the Secret Laboratory and the one- 
man-band type of character who did 
the surgery on the hero to make 
him superhuman. 

This is not the type of story 
that makes If the high quality maga- 
zine that it is. Please avoid clutter- 
ing your future issues with stories 
like this one — especially if they 
take up as much space as this one 
did! — Robert Heitman, 113 South 
37th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsyl- 
vania 19104. 

♦ « « 

Dear Editor: 

The Silkie was even better than 
Van Vogt’s last. The Expendables. 
Please keep Van Vogt coming! 

Kagan is a find — hope to see 
more of him. Where has Sturgeon 
gone? And — I hate to say this, but 
the only story in your aU-Sraith 
issue that was worth beans was The 
Imperial Stars. But its quality made 
up for the other three. 

Would you accept an ‘TFirstory^ 
that would have to be published as 
a serial ? — Jack Baldwin, 905 
North Alison Street, Santa Barbara, 
California 93103. 

• Yep. — Editor. 

And that’s about k for another 
issue. Our first for this issue is L. 
D. Ogle of Muskegon, Michigan. 
Next issue we’re going to try to 
squeeze in an extra page or two 
of Hue and Cry because the letters 
are beginning to pile up . but 
come to think of it, we’ve got a 
serial installment, a long Van Vogt 
and a couple of other items that 
may get in the way . well, keep 
the letters coming anyway! We’ll 
do the best we can. — The Editor.
