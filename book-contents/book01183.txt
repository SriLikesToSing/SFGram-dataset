the other. “Three moves. Acknowl- 
edged.” 

“I choose to go first.” 

“I follow you. Acknowledged.” 
They removed themselves from 
the temporal sequence and regarded 
the history of the world. 

Then Dust dropped into the 
Paleolithic and raised and uncov- 
ered metal deposits across the 
south of Europe. 

“Move one completed.” 

Blood considered for a timeless 
time then moved to the second cen- 
tury B.C. and induced extensive le- 
sions in the carotids of Marcus Por- 
cius Cato where he stood in the 
Roman Senate, moments away from 
another “Carthago delenda est.” 
“Move one completed.” 

Dust entered the fourth century 
A.D. and injected an air bubble into 
the bloodstream of the sleeping 
Julius Ambrosius, the Lion of 
Mithra. 

“Move two completed.” 

Blood moved to eighth century 
Damascus and did the same to 
Abou Iskafar, in the room where he 
carved curling alphabets from 
small, hard blocks of wood. 

“Move two completed.” 

Dust contemplated the play. 
“Subtle move, that.” 

“Thank you.” 

“But not good enough, I feel. 
Observe.” 

Dust moved to seventeenth cen- 
tury England and, on the morning 
before the search, removed from his 
laboratory all traces of the forbid- 



den chemical experiments which 
had cost Isaac Newton his life. 

“Move three completed.” 

“Good move. But I think I’ve 
got you.” 

Blood dropped to early nineteenth 
century England and disposed of 
Charles Babbage. 

“Move three completed.” 

Both rested, studying the posi- 
tions. 

“Ready?” said Blood. 

“Yes.” 

They reentered the sequence of 
temporality at the point they had 
departed. 

It took but an instant. It moved 
like the cracking of a whip below 
them. 

They departed the sequence once 
more, to study the separate effects 
of their moves now that the general 
result was known. They observed: 

The south of Europe flourished. 
Rome was founded and grew in 
power several centuries sooner than 
had previously been the case. 
Greece was conquered before the 
flame of Athens burned with its 
greatest intensity. With the death of 
Cato the Elder the final Punic War 
was postponed. Carthage also con- 
tinued to grow, extending her em- 
pire far to the east and the south. 
The death of Julius Ambrosius 
aborted the Mithraist revival and 
Christianity became the state reli- 
gion in Rome. The Carthaginians 
spread their power throughout the 
middle east. Mithraism was ack- 
nowledged as their state religion. 



6 



GALAXY 




The clash did not occur until the 
fifth century. Carthage itself was 
destroyed, the westward limits of its 
empire pushed back to Alexandria. 
Fifty years later, the Pope called for 
a crusade. These occurred with 
some regularity for the next century 
and a quarter, further fragmenting 
the Carthaginian empire while sap- 
ping the enormous bureaucracy 
which had grown up in Italy. The 
fighting fell off, ceased, the lines 
were drawn, an economic depres- 
sion swept the Mediterranean area. 
Outlying districts grumbled over 
taxes and conscription, revolted. 
The general anarchy which followed 
the wars of secession settled down 
into a dark age reminiscent of that 
in the initial undisturbed sequence. 
Off in Asia Minor, the printing 
press was not developed. 

“Stalemate till then, anyway,” 
said Blood. 

“Yes, but look what Newton 
did.” 

“How could you have known?” 

“That is the difference between a 
good player and an inspired player. 
I saw his potential even when he 
was fooling around with alchemy. 
Look what he did for their science, 
single-handed — everything! Your 
next move was too late and too 
weak.” 

“Yes. I thought I might still kill 
their computers by destroying the 
founder of International Difference 
Machines, Ltd.” 

Dust chuckled. 

“That was indeed ironic. Instead 



of an IDM 120, the Beagle took 
along a young naturalist named 
Darwin.” 

Blood glanced along to the end 
of the sequence where the radioac- 
tive dust was scattered across a life- 
less globe. 

“But it was not the science that 
did it, or the religion.” 

“Of course not,” said Dust. “It 
is all a matter of emphasis.” 

“You were lucky. I want a re- 
match.” 

“All right. 1 will even give you 
your choice: Blood or Dust?” 

“I’ll stick with Blood.” 

“Very well. Winner elects to go 
first. Excuse me.” 

Dust moved to second century 
Rome and healed the carotid lesions 
which had produced Cato’s cerebral 
hemorrhage.” 

“Move one completed.” 

Blood entered eastern Germany 
in the sixteenth century and induced 
identical lesions in the Vatican as- 
sassin who had slain Martin Luther. 
“Move one completed.” 

“You are skipping pretty far 
along.” 

“It is all a matter of emphasis.” 
“Truer and truer. Very well. 
You saved Luther. I will save Bab- 
bage. Excuse me.” 

An instantless instant later Dust 
had returned. 

“Move two completed.” 

Blood studied the playing area 
with extreme concentration. Then, 
“All right.” 



THE GAME OF BLOOD AND DUST 



7 




Blood entered Chewy’s Theater 
on the evening in 1865 when the 
disgruntled actor had taken a shot at 
the President of the United States. 
Delicately altering the course of the 
bullet in midair, he made it reach 
its target. 

“Move two completed.” 

“I believe that you are bluffing,” 
said Dust. “You could not have 
worked out all the ramifications.” 
“Wait and see.” 

Dust regarded the area with in- 
tense scrutiny. 

“All right, then. You killed a 
president. I am going to save 
one — or at least prolong his life 
somewhat. I want Woodrow Wilson 
to see that combine of nations 
founded. Its failure will mean more 
than if it had never been — and it 
will fail. — Excuse me.” 

Dust entered the twentieth cen- 
tury and did some repair work 
within the long-jawed man. 

“Move three completed.” 

“Then I, too, shall save one.” 
Blood entered the century at a 
farther point and assured the failure 
of Leon Nozdrev, the man who had 
assassinated Nikita Kruschev. 

“Move three completed.” 
“Ready, then?” 

“Ready.” 

They reentered the sequence. The 
long whip cracked. Radio noises 
hummed about them. Satellites or- 
bitted the world. Highways webbed 
the continents. Dusty cities held 
their points of power throughout. 
Ships clove the seas. Jets slid 



through the atmosphere. Grass 
grew. Birds migrated. Fishes nib- 
bled. 

Blood chuckled. 

“You have to admit it was very 
close,” said Dust. 

“As you were saying, there is a 
difference between a good player 
and an inspired player.” 

“You were lucky, too.” 

Blood chuckled again. 

They regarded the world, its two 
and a half billions of people, their 
cities, their devices. 

After a time, the inhabitant of the 
forward point spoke: 

“Best two out of three?” 

“All right. I am Blood. I go 
first.” 

“. .And I am Dust. I follow 



you.” ★

GALAXY 





Joe haldeman wrote to me a 
couple of months ago and asked me 
to co-keynote this convention. He 
said, “I want you to deal with the 
various problems that face us in the 
near future — energy sources, over- 
population, eco-disaster and so 
forth.” 

And I said I would, but actually I 
had my fingers crossed. Ten or fif- 
teen years ago I used to lecture a 
lot on those subjects. I would talk 
about the black rainfall in Boston, 
where the smog was so thick the 
police couldn’t arrest the pol- 
luters — they couldn’t see the 
tops of the chimneys to know 
whose stacks were doing it. And I’d 
talk about the rivers in New Eng- 
land so filthy that you not only 
can’t drink the water — or swim in 
it — it isn’t even safe to drive a 
motorboat in it; the spray coming 
up over the coaming can give you a 

FORUM 



disease. And it all went over very 
big with my audiences. They’d 
have a delicious shudder of fear, 
and a momentary glow of resolution 
to clean up our soiled planet — and 
then they would light their cigarettes, 
and get into their cars and turn 
on their air-conditioners and pump 
exhaust fumes all the way to their 
air-conditioned, energy-using 
homes and offices. I remember giv- 
ing that talk in Cambridge once 
— the English Cambridge, that is. 
My host was a marvelous fellow 
who applauded every word I said 
and took me to his home for a drink 
after the lecture. His home was a 
narrowboat moored in the River 
Cam, and while we were drinking 
and talking about the horrors of pol- 
lution I felt the need to go to the 
John, and I did, and while I was in 
there a thought struck me, and 
when I came out I opened my 

9 



mouth to ask him a question — He 
anticipated me. “Oh, yes,” he said 
at once, “it goes right into the 
water, sure enough. But, God, 
man, what else can I do? It would 
cost me thirty pounds to put in a 
sewage trap!” 

And anyway that was ten or fif- 
teen years ago, and a lot of time 
has passed. I’m a science-fiction 
writer. I like to talk about the fu- 
ture. Pollution, overpopulation, 
urban crisis, racial strife, protein 
shortage, fuel shortage, welfare 
disasters — those are all in the pres- 
ent; and I bet that every one of you 
in this room has heard so much 
about them you never want to hear 
another word on any of these sub- 
jects. Right? 

Right. Well, I have a surprise for 
you. I’m going to talk about them 
anyhow. But not just yet — I have 
something else I want to say 
first — and when I do I think I may, 
believe it or not, have something 
new to say about them. 

But first I’m going to talk about 
science fiction. 

Science fiction is a very good 
way of looking at the future. For 
one thing, it’s cheap. If you want to 
see what an atomic war is going to 
do, it is cheaper to \Vrite a story 
about it then it is to start a war. 
Also it is a sort of diluted reality; 
people can confront realities in a 
science-fiction story that they don’t 
want to hear about in real life. 

But it is also a good way of 
matching up possible future events 

10 



in such a way that problems be- 
come solutions. 

Now this is a science-fiction way 
of looking at things. It is not the 
real world’s way. The real world 
bumbles along, throwing its empty 
beer cans out the car window and 
expecting someone else to pick 
them up; and when the real world 
gets a flat because somebody in the 
car ahead of it has been old- 
fashioned enough to throw out a 
beer bottle rather than a can, it feels 
mightily aggrieved. So it appoints a 
special commission to study the en- 
vironmental impact of throwing 
beer bottles out of cars, hires a 
large staff of experts out of tax 
money and devises an automatic 
highway vacuum cleaner to suck up 
all the broken glass. The real world 
takes one problem at a time and 
looks for the single solution to the 
problem, which after much study 
always turns out to be the same 
thing: money. Or, what is the same 
thing — but even more damaging in 
the sense of natural law — the use of 
problem-creating mechanisms to get 
rid of the effects of other problems. 

I’ll give you an example. There 
is a scarce resource in the world; 
high-temperature heat. There is 
plenty of low-temperature heat. 
That’s where the whole universe is 
going, sooner or later, according to 
the laws of entropy; and we are 
moving the process along just as 
fast as we can. 

High-temperature heat is much 
harder to come by; the principal 

GALAXY 




way we get it is by sending drillers 
and pumpers to Saudi Arabia and 
other unattractive places to suck up 
huge quantities of oil out of the 
ground. 

That oil is not just stuff that 
bums. It is basic hydrocarbon, and 
if you don’t bum it you can use it 
in a lot of jazzy other ways: you 
can grow food on it, you can turn it 
into drugs and dyes and plastics. 
You can even just leave it there and 
wait until you need basic organic 
feedstocks even worse than we do 
now. 

We don’t do that — we burn it. 
Once place we bum it is in power 
plants. We take our high- 
temperature heat, and we boil water 
with it. We turn the water into 
steam, the steam into electricity and 
we move the electricity out over 
wires. And then if we’ve been 
dumb enough to swallow the stories 
the public utilities people have been 
telling us and bought outselves an 
all-electric house, we take the elec- 
tricity and we use it to warm our 
rooms to seventy-eight degrees, and 
heat some water for a bath to 
maybe 100°, and put some in our 
washing machine at perhaps 
140° — all low-temparature heat 
again, you see. And meanwhile, 
back at the power plant, all that 
steam has come out of the turbines 
and condensed. And they have 
oceans of water — some at seventy- 
eight degrees and some at a 
hundred and ten and some at a 
hundred and forty — and they have a 

FORUM 



hell of a job getting rid of it. They 
pour it into the rivers and they kill 
the fish. They pump it into cooling 
towers, and they create manmade 
fogs that have been known to close 
down airports for a week on end. 

You see what I’m talking about? 
It takes no special brains to see that 
if what you want is just enough 
heat to warm a room, it is pretty 
stupid to use a kind of heat that can 
smelt iron and then dilute it to the 
room temperature you like 
— especially as you have the prob- 
lem of throwing away enormous 
quantities of room-warming heat on 
the next block. 

Any engineers present will im- 
mediately point out that there are 
difficulties here; and so there are. 
Difficulties of capital funding, dif- 
ficulties of design, difficulties of 
seasonal load. But the difficulties 
do not add up to enough to spoil 
the general principle that the prob- 
lem of getting rid of waste heat can 
in fact be the solution to the prob- 
lem of heating a house. 

Science fiction is a good way of 
matching these phenomena together. 
Not only on the hardware level. I 
remember a marvelous Fritz Leiber 
story. Sanity, the world was going 
mad, and the problem was how so- 
ciety could survive when every per- 
son in it was insane. Fritz solved it 
beautifully; he matched the kind of 
insanity to the job requirement. I 
don’t remember the exact mixes 
— something like paranoids became 
policemen, manic-depressives be- 
ll 




came book reviewers. not too 
much unlike the real world at that. 
Then there was a Harry Harrison 
story — I published it, I think in 
Galaxy, a decade or so ago, but I’m 
sorry to say I don’t remember the 
title. The problem was robots mul- 
tiplying on their own. A familiar 
scare theme in science fiction, 
right? But in Harry’s stOry the 
robots became raw materials. Peo- 
ple trapped the little ones for tran- 
sistors, stalked and shot big ones for 
sheetmetal sidings for their homes 
and so on. 

And of course science fiction has 
proposed gross-scale improvements 
in the way things are done for a 
long time. Automatic little cars in- 
stead of privately owned 8-cylinder 
monsters. Telecommunications in- 
stead of commuting — we see a little 
of that now; I think we’ll see more. 
Domed cities. You know, I’ve 
always suspected Buckminster Fuller 
of being a secret science-fiction fan. 
His geodesics look an awful lot like 
a Wonder Stories cover from say 
1931. But what Fuller has done, of 
course, has been to put the numbers 
into the science-fiction story. 

And the numbers, as a matter of 
fact, are interesting. Consider New 
York. Fuller wants to build a dome 
across it two miles wide. To keep 
the rain out? No, to keep heat 
where it belongs — out in summer, 
in winter in. The Manhattan 
skyline, Fuller points out, is about 
as perfectly designed a radiator sys- 
tem as you could build: all those 



spindly little spikes sticking out into 
the air, each one of them losing 
heat from every side and spire and 
comice. If you put a dome over it 
you would save enormous amounts 
of both air-conditioning and heat- 
ing. In fact, the radiating skyscrap- 
ers pour away eighty times as much 
energy as a dome would. Which 
would pay for an awful lot of 
geodesic construction in a short 
time. 

There is no engineering problem 
here. There is a different kind of 
problem that keeps us from doming 
in New York and Washington and 
Chicago — above all, Chicago — and 
most of the other major cities in the 
world: that is, convincing the peo- 
ple who have to foot the bill that 
it’s worth it. 

That’s a different kind of game, 
and the name of that particular 
game is “politics”. 

At this point 1 arrogate to myself 
the privilege of any writer who has 
an audience at his mercy, and I in- 
tend to talk a little bit about some 
of my own work. 

There are two in particular. One 
is a science-fiction story, published 
in F&SF about a year ago, called In 
the Problem Pit. The other is a 
non-fiction -book, published by Bal- 
lantine for 1972 — and, I believe, to 
be published by somebody else for 
1976 — called practical politics. 
In the Problem Pit describes a pro- 
cedure for identifying what the 
world’s real problems are, and solv- 



12 



GALAXY 




ing them — hopefully, by using one 
problem to solve another, as I was 
talking about a moment ago. 
PRACTICAL POLITICS describes the 
procedure for making those solu- 
tions transit from theory to reality, 
by means of the existing political 
institutions — the elections, the polit- 
ical party machinery and so on. 

One of the nice things about 
being a writer is that you can give a 
sort of a reality to your fantasies by 
writing them out on paper. An even 
nicer thing — sometimes quite a 
frightening thing — is to find that 
some people somewhere have taken 
those spelled-out fantasies and 
transformed them into that other 
kind of fantasy we call the real 
world. It happens a lot with science 
fiction, though we who write it 
don’t always know when it has 
happened. But in the case of 
PRACTICAL POLITICS I’ve Seen it 
happen; in places like Georgia and 
California and Ontario I’ve heard of 
people and groups who have 
brought the book and done what it 
says and made real, substantive 
changes in their worlds. A couple 
of weeks ago I sat on the porch of 
the mayor of Gpe May, New Jer- 
sey, listening to him tell me how he 
came to be mayor: He got hold of a 
copy of my book, did what it 
said — ^and elected not only himself 
but a whole city council. All this is 
great fun and a joy — but also, I 
must say, a little scary. 

But in order to convert theoreti- 
cal solutions into reality — as in 



PRACTICAL POLITICS — first you have 
to find the solutions. That is where 
the story in the problem pit 
comes in. 

IN THE PROBLEM PIT tells of a 
government-funded problem-solving 
system located in some large caves 
near the radio observatory at 
Arecibo, Puerto Rico — no particular 
reason that it should be there, ex- 
cept that I had just visited Arecibo a 
few weeks before I wrote the story. 
(You can reconstruct any writer’s 
autobiography from what he writes, 
if you know how to interpret it.) It 
is a long story, and a lot of its wor- 
dage is devoted to spelling out how 
it works: I don’t have time to go 
into it all here. (Anyway, it will be 
published by and by as part of a 
collection called in the problem 
PIT and other problem-solving 
science-fiction stories. I’d rather 
you read it than listened to me tell 
you about it. I get better royalties 
that way.) But in the problem pit 
isn’t just a story. 

It is also a proposal for real-life 
problem-solving. As far as I know 
no one has actually transformed that 
fantasy into real-world reality yet, 
but the World Future Society has 
offered me a chance to run a 
pilot-model demonstration right here 
in Washington at their Second Gen- 
eral Assembly next May. 

So by the 75 Worldcon, if any of 
you are interested, maybe I can re- 
port on how well it works. 

And all of this, you see, is sim- 
ply one variation or another on the

basic science-fiction game: creating 
new worlds and seeing how they 
work out. We sf writers have been 
doing it for years on paper. We sf 
readers have been doing it all our 
lives in our heads. Politicians do 
it — usually in limited, power-and- 
plunder-hungry ways, but do it all 
the same. Futurologists do it, it is 
their only raison d’etre, if indeed 
they can be said to have one at all. 
And scientists do it. 

And now at the end of my talk I 
would like to tell you about the way 
one particular scientist has played 
this game. He is a physicist, and 
his name is Peter Fong — from 
Emory University in Atlanta — and I 
certainly hope he is a science- 
fiction fan. One of these days I 
want to meet him, and I would not 
like to discover that he has done 
this bright thing without benefit of 
all the thinking we’ve been putting 
into Galaxy and Analog and F&SF 
for the last umpty-ump years. 

First, let’s look at the trouble 
we’re in. 

Remember last winter’s energy 
crisis? That’s powerful trouble. 
Real trouble — and we’re still in it, 
we just pretend that taking an aspi- 
rin has cured the cancer of the 
brain; but the cancer is still there 
and deadly. 

Remember urban crime? Society’s 
rejects — mostly black or Spanish- 
speaking, mostly the people, or the 
children of the people, who had a 
clear choice between starving on a 



plantation somewhere and going on 
relief in New York or Baltimore 
and wisely chose relief. Remember 
mugging, remember drugs, re- 
member the hard-core unemployed 
in the city’s slums? 

Remember pollution? the car ex- 
haust that rots these marble build- 
ings in Washington? The sewage 
that has destroyed a hundred square 
miles of ocean bottom off New 
York, befouled San Francisco Bay 
and turned much of the Mediterra- 
nean into a cesspool? 

Remember starvation? Hundreds 
of millions of people in the world 
living on the borderline, where a 
drought or a flood can push them 
over the hunger point into death? 
Tens of millions of children bom 
into lives that do not give them 
enough protein while their brains 
are building, so that all their lives 
they will be a little less quick, a lit- 
tle less capable than they should 
have been? 

All these problems are right with 
us right this minute, and they are 
deadly ones. And no solution is in 
sight — unless, Peter Fong says, we 
take all these problems and let them 
solve each other. 

How do we do that? 

Com and booze. 

Now alcohol is a well-known 
problem-solver. Some of my best 
friends have solved their problems 
that way, and keep right on doing 
it, until they solve themselves into 
delirium tremens and death. That 
isn’t quite what Fong has in mind.

GALAXY 




Don’t drink the alcohol, he says. 
Put it in the tank of your car. If you 
replace 20% of the gas in your tank 
with alcohol you don’t have to do a 
thing to the engine — in fact, it 
works better than it now does on 
gasoline — you cut down the pollut- 
ing emissions by 20% right then, 
instantly; you reduce the need for 
oil imports, help the balance of 
payment, take the Arab sheiks 
down a peg and strike a blow for 
the independence of Israel. Name 
it. You do it, and that’s how. 

Ah, you say, fine. But where do 
you get the alcohol? 

Why, you grow a lot of corn. 
You don’t need all the corn for 
fermentation into alcohol, only the 
starch. You’ve got 30% left over in 
the form of protein and 3% in the 
form of oil. You can feed these to 
hungry people if you like — they are 
extremely nutritious. Or you can 
feed them to livestock, cutting the 
cost of raising steers, putting more 
steaks in your supermarket and 
ending — did you forget this 
one? — the meat shortage too. You 
also have the com stalks left over, 
and you use them to fuel the boilers 
that distills the fermented starch 
into pure alky. 

Who grows the com? Ah, says 
Fong, you have all those urban 
hardcore unemployed. Give them a 
40-acre farm apiece, a million and a 
half 40-acre farms. Better still, 
don’t give them to them. Sell them. 
All this stuff is cottage industry, it 
can be done just as well in indi- 




his most devastating novel yet . 

The Conpanli Of Glory 

Atomic war has reduced the earth to a 
primitive state — history is no longer 
written . plagues and radiation death 
are common . Demetrios, the former 
Adam Freeman, remembers what life 
once was and tells a new generation of 
earthlings the terrifying tale of a world 
devastated by the Twenty Minute War!

fare, not to mention the advantages 
of running your own vegetable

So on a reasonable mortgage your 
formerly unemployed can pay off 
his farm free and clear, feed his 
family, educate his kids and, for the 
first time in his life, most likely, 
find himself in a world where his 
own life has some point and pur- 
pose.

up. The United States is full of 
played-out farmland, or soil that 
doesn’t want to grow a crop. Bad 
land, but land. All it needs is some- 
thing to make the bad land good, 
and we have that — every one of us 
produces about eight ounces of it 
every day, and there are a lot of us 
producing — and we flush it away 
and ruin our waterways with it, and 
yet it is the finest and best stuff you 
can get to make things grow. The 
Japanese and Chinese have used 
human excrement to grow crops for 
hundreds of years. We westerners 
are much too fastidious. Indeed, 
there is some reason for daintiness 
here; there is a risk of disease, a 
problem of sterilization. But the 
basic problem is esthetic. We don’t 
like to put into our mouths some- 
thing we know to be containing 
molecules that recently came out of 
some other part of another person’s 
anatomy — it seems to be all right if 
it came out of a horse or a cow, 
rather than a person, which is rather 
strange — but strange or not the pre- 
judice is there. Only it disappears if 
you use the excrement to fertilize 
something you’re going to put in 
the tank of your car. 

And so you’ve solved the lot 
— end sewage pollution, cut down 
car exhaust damage, slash the relief 
rolls, radically diminish the precon- 
ditions for slums and urban crime, 
help the balance of payments, de- 
crease the velocity of the energy 
crunch, make steaks cheaper and 
more available ... it kills every 



bird in sight, claims Fong with 
modest self-satisfaction, even up to 
economic growth and school bus- 
ing. 

And by gosh, when you look at 
it, it does. 

Now, what’s wrong with this 
proposal? 

Oh, a few things. Several scho- 
lars have complained that its long- 
term effects diminish; it is only a 
temporary solution, they say. And 
that’s true enough. In the long run 
we have to find quite different ways 
to live. But the trouble with the 
long run, as John Maynard Keynes 
told Franklin Roosevelt thirty or 
forty years ago, is that in the long 
run we are all dead. 

It also does not solve every prob- 
lem for everyone; there are only a 
million and a half farms proposed, 
and there are more than a million 
and a half people in trouble. 

But what a beginning! And the 
beauty of it is that each problem 
solves the other, like cobras sup- 
porting themselves by eating each 
others’ tails, until the ring is com- 
plete and the problems all disap- 
pear. 

So THERE WE ARE — and Well 
enough, too; I’m Just about out of 
time. I want to steal just a minute 
or two more to close on another 
note — a rather different one, and 
quite a personal one. 

I suppose a lot of you have heard 
me speak before, perhaps at the Los 



16 



GALAXY 




Angeles Worldcon a couple of years 
ago; and perhaps if you do you re- 
member what is an article of faith 
with me. That you and I, and Harry 
Stubbs and Harlan Ellison and all of 
us here are in some way brothers. 
We are a family. We are united in a 
way that I can only faintly perceive, 
but which seems to me to be so 
strong a way that although we differ 
terribly from each other on ques- 
tions of religion and politics and 
life style — and battle among our- 
selves on matters of dominance and 
resentment — yet we always come 
back to each other, to share what 
we have done and learned; because 
who else is there to talk to? 

Well, I don’t quite mean that. 
There are other people to talk to. 
More than three billion of them, on 
one level or another. But there is 
something about us, about all of us, 
in this room and in all the other 
places in the world where science- 
fiction people get together, that 
makes us important to each other, 
for the perceptions and the under- 
standings that we can best share. 
We are droogs, sometimes, joining 
together to stomp the rest of the 
world. We are water brothers, some- 
times, sharing the precious resource 
of imagination and creation. 

We may, of course, from time to 
time hate each others’ guts. You

seat — you may not like me very 
much, and maybe I don’t especially 
care for you. But in some way you 
are a very important part of my

life ... as I think I am, of course, 
of yours. 

So I talk, on subjects like these, 
many times in many places to all 
kinds of audiences. And I say pretty 
much the same things. The details 
change as the world changes, but 
the theme is all about the same. 

But when I talk here, to you 
— my friends, my water-brothers, 
my droogs — I want to talk in a spe- 
cial way. I don’t want just to argue 
you into my way of thinking. Or to 
inform you, or to educate you, or 
even to entertain you. What I want 
is to share with you — my family 
— that very basic article of faith in 
my head which says there are no 
problems, there are no hopeless di- 
sasters, there are no inevitable 
dooms; there are only games we 
play with ourselves, pollution 
games and crime games — traps we 
put ourselves into, shortage traps 
and inadequacy traps — and we can 
stop playing the games, we can free 
ourselves from the traps, any time. 

All we have to do is summon up 
the resolution to do it, and all it 
needs for that to happen is for some 
people somewhere to make up their 
minds to start it. To start thinking 
in terms of what we want, rather 
than what we fear. To start plan- 
ning not for what makes us more 
rich, but for what makes us more 
free. 

It can be done — by somebody. 
And — droogs, siblings, water- 
brothers, friends — if we don’t do it, 
who the hell will? ★

I 

THE BASTIONS 
OF THE WHORE 
Four kilometers from Ricardo, 
the horsemen stopped for a rest, 
and while their ponies stretched 
down to graze, the men stared up at 
the AcropKtlis. They were Ecofreaks 
and far from home, dressed in 
beaded leather suits and wearing 
floppy black hats. Their long hair 
was braided, their faces tanned, but 
these were not ordinary herdsmen, 
as evidenced by the ornate ceremo- 
nial daggers and the gilded red 
Crestmore bibles that hung from 
their belts. 

Mutagrass rolled in the breeze 
behind them. It thinned out ahead 
us steppe gave way to no man’s 
land — the Desolation, in tribal 
parlance — a dusty, boulder-strewn 
ring around the city, made by the 

HELIUM 



deadly emanations of gravitron. 

Mycal Bono, leader of the group, 
took off his hat and wiped his 
forehead with the back of his hand. 
He closed and opened his eyes to 
ease the wind sting. Then he threw 
his head back to see Ricardo’s five 
looming towers. Today the tips 
were lost in moving clouds. He 
couldn’t see the towers in their en- 
tirety. Drilla-glass mirrored the set- 
ting sun. A reticulation of dark 
plastosteel held the glass in place 
and supported the structures. At this 
distance, the frame resembled a 
screen of hexagons. 

Bono thought: Poisonous silver 
stems. Rooted in the Desolation. 
Full of humanity. 

He shook his head. He hadn’t 
seen a structure in years, and the 
prospect of Ricardo, especially at 
close proximity, was awesome. 

19 



Most structures, including those of 
Ricardo, were at least three 
thousand meters from root to 
crown, an unbelievable height. The 
sway of the towers induced dizzi- 
ness. The observer felt that the 
structures leaned threateningly down 
toward him. 

Bono turned away, plagued by a 
childhood memory. It had come on 
him early in the morning while 
boarding the large helicopters near 
Wellhead for the long flight north. 
The feeling had persisted. The 
forty-kilometer ride from the Stag- 
ing Station hadn’t shaken his mood. 

As a small boy his father had 
taken him to Husten, a mono-tower 
city. Panic had gripped him a short 
way into the Desolation. The gravi- 
tron vibrations had tightened about 
his body like so many invisible 
claws, and he had screamed and 
fought until his father had sent him 
back with a mutant slave. At the 
time his relatives had teased him 
about that, calling him a true 
tribesman — one who couldn’t stand 
the grav. 

Men rested all around him. Some 
had dismounted. Some sat and 
stared at Ricardo’s visible parts 
below the clouds. Talk buzzed. 

To his left the heavy-set Sonder, 
physicist of the group, explained 
the mysteries of gravitron to a 
youngster they’d picked up at the 
Staging Station to take the horses 
back. 

“Drums,” Sonder was saying. 
“Drums in the caves below the tow- 
ers. They generate the stuff. And 
our Helium cools the machines. No 
Helium, Freddy, and poof! Down 
she goes.’’ 

Bono imagined Ricardo falling. 

20 



He saw the framework buckle and 
twist. He saw the towers sag, split 
apart, and spill millions of people 
into the air — the hard outer crust 
and the soft, organic, mushy in- 
nards. In mind’s eye he saw people, 
rubble, and machinery fall down in 
a rush. Then he imagined Desola- 
tion dust rising like a veil to cover 
the scene. 

It was a vision of the Great 
Change — the end of the structures. 
Like many other young Activists, 
Bono had heard the Older Tack 
hold forth about it with a Crestmore 
bible open in his hand. “The struc- 
tures must be destroyed,” Old Tack 
had thundered with a balled, veined 
fist shaking the air. “We can’t let 
the Abomination take over earth 
again!” And with that OT had al- 
ways hit the table with a crash. Old 
Tack had had bushy grey eyebrows, 
a florid face, and eyes that had 
flashed. You couldn’t help remem- 
bering such a man. He left a deep 
impression, especially on the 
young. 

Old Tack was dead. Like the 
legendary Moses of the Biblibooks, 
he had died before his dream had 
been fulfilled. Unlike the legendary 
Moses, he hadn’t even glimpsed the 
promised land. 

Bono’s situation was not without 
irony. The least enthusiastic of the 
younger Activists stood before 
Ricardo with a mandate to negotiate 
the last and decisive Helium deal. 
Bono’s assignment amounted to noth- 
ing less than the destruction of 
Union’s thirty-nine structures. 
Would Mycal Bono, the silent 
doubter, achieve OT’s dream? 

Bono fell into a brooding con- 
templation of his role. He felt ex- 

GALAXY 




tremely small and puny — a mote of 
dust in the vast sweep of history 
that had created the Union of Struc- 
tures. A thousand years seemed a 
very long time against his thirty. 

A thousand years, yes, give or 
take a handful. The last of the so- 
called limited nuclear wars had 
been followed by a period of inter- 
regnum. The last one had 
been. .which? LNW XII? LNW 
Xin? Bono could never remember. 
At the Academy of Action, he’d 
had to memorize the circumstances 
surrounding each war, but they all 
ran into each other in his mind. 
Well, it didn’t matter a great deal. 
What mattered were the structures. 

Bono tried to imagine their 
genesis: how the ancient city dwel- 
lers had invented gravitron wjth 
whose aid vertical cities could be 
flung into the sky. The ancients had 
gone straight from a mole-like exis- 
tence in underground bunkers into 
the heights. In one gigantic leap, as 
it were. In his mind Bono pictured 
structures rising out of the rubble, 
yes, like poisonous stems. 
Structure-man had found an answer 
to the scarcity of useable land. Re- 
markable as it seemed, nevertheless 
it was true — nearly 100 million 
people in structures occuped a mere 
eight hundred square kilometers of 
ground, all of it along the coasts. 
Their fusion reactors ran on hy- 
drogen ions that were plentiful in the 
sea. 

What a shock it must have been 
to the pious tribal elders, it oc- 
curred to him. If the ancient tribesmen 
had been anything like the Older 
Tack, they must have fallen into 
paroxysms of rage when the first 
reports of structures came filtering 

HELIUM 



back to Hinterland. The Technology 
Beast has risen again! No sooner 
dead than resurrected. Foul 
Phoenix. And the old hatred had 
burst into flame again. 

Bono knew himself a product of 
that hatred. A thousand years of 
hate had caused him to sit here be- 
fore Ricardo on a pony with a se- 
cret locked in his brain. The tribes 
had waited a thousand years for this 
opportunity. Now they only needed 
a small assist, a very small favor 
from Union. If only Union could be 
duped! If Union could be persuaded 
to mix up the poison it would have 
to swallow — then Technology 
would be finished. 

Or would it? Bono experienced a 
stir of doubt. Union might be de- 
stroyed. But then, for all they 
knew, Technology might rise up 
elsewhere — in Europe, in Asia, in 
Australia. Since LNW XII or XIII, 
whichever it was, contact with 
those continents had been lost 
— more by choice than necessity. 
Structure-men Had the means to 
travel. But exploration was not their 
long suit. Life in structures seemed 
to be an end in itself — or it de- 
stroyed curiosity. Maybe. The men 
of Union lived too far from the sur- 
face of the earth. They saw it 
through windows. Always. The 
horizon did not entice them. Bono 
guessed that life on other continents 
must be like life in Hinterland: sim- 
ple and savage. Structure-man 
wanted no part of that. If it weren’t 
for Helium. 

Helium. 

The noble gas was essential for 
the gravitron reaction. And the 
pipeline through which it flowed 
was like an umbillical cord that 



21 




bound structure dwellers to the 
earth. Against their will, in a sense. 
Bono suspected that Union would 
pay no attention to the tribes at all 
if it weren’t for those rich Tex- 
ahoma wells — or if they could get 
enough Helium out of the air, 
which they couldn’t. But they did 
need Helium. And therefore their 
missiles ringed North America, 
aimed inland, a perpetual threat. 

Bono shook his head. It was all 
too vast, too much, too improbable. 
His task seemed overwhelming. He 
had no confidence in this venture, 
yet here he was. It seemed wrong, 
somehow. 

Bono sighed and turned to his 
right. 

Sunk deep into his saddle, tire- 
some old Franco Dart had reached 
over and now pulled Bono’s sleeve. 
He pointed to a hovering airship 
some distance from the road. Union 
airships were held aloft by gravitron 
and resembled large glistening rods. 
One blunt, rounded end of the ship 
faced the horsemen. The ship had 
picked them up a kilometer or two 
outside the Staging Station and had 
shadowed their approach ever sinee. 

Dart said: “They’re filming, 
Mycal. They film and film. I’ll bet 
you Reston Proctor is watching us. 
I’ll bet that he sees us talking.’’ 

On Bono’s left Sonder said: 
“No, Freddy, you don’t get it. The 
vibes make the steel light. Light as 
feathers. It’s the plastosteel, not the 
drilla-glass.’’ 

Bono didn’t answer Dart. He still 
mused about his chances of success, 
that worrisome childhood memory 
in the background. 

Dart peered at Bono with a dis- 
approving look. The chiefs hooked 

22 



nose and forked black beard gave 
Bono an aggressive air, but Dart 
saw a dreamy haze in Bono’s eyes, 
a telltale trembling around his lips. 
Bono had a good face, but he 
lacked that. .something; that spe- 
cial quality, leadership. 

With a measure of pride Dart re- 
called how he had opposed Bono’s 
appointment as chief of mission. 
Dart had protested, oh, yes. He had 
the courage to oppose, whatever his 
age. His was a voice of wisdom 
among the brash young men around 
Jonny Tack. 

“Go with him,’’ Tack had said. 
“Keep your eyes on him.” 

But Tack had sent him as a 
‘senior advisor,’ that is to say with- 
out authority — which made Dart 
mourn the passing of the Older 
Tack. Now there was a man! 

“Mycal,” Dart called again. “I 
said, they’re filming us!” 

“What? Oh, yes. You’ve said 
that before. The Media.” 

“It’s more serious than that. 
They use the films for intelligence. 
They study our faces. They build 
profiles on us. Psychometry.” 

Bono shrugged. “We can’t stop 
them.” 

“No, not that] But you must be 
aware of it.” 

“I am aware. Believe me. 
Franco, I’m aware.” 

A group in the rear laughed up- 
roariously at something. The noise 
startled a flock of black carries. 
They rose from the long mutagrass, 
flew low over the ground, then 
dropped out of sight again. 

Dart wondered if the men were 
laughing at him. He threw them a 
suspicious look. 

“Look, Freddy, imagine a 

GALAXY 




molecule like this, see? Fifteen in a 
row? The gavitron vibes come in 
here, see? And they make these lit- 
tle balls stretch. Got it?” 

Bono glanced at Freddy and saw 
that he still hadn’t got it. Then he 
turned to Dart, aware that the old 
man was unhappy. The younger 
men all humored Dart, the last sur- 
viving member of the old core of 
Activists. 

“What do you think. Franco?” 
Bono gestured toward Ricardo with 
his hat. ‘‘The bastions of the 
whore- — will they fall this time?” 
‘‘All thirty-nine of them, on all 
the coasts. It is written.” Dart 
slapped the red Crestmore bible hung 
on a chain from his belt. ‘‘ ‘Her 
bastions shall crumble, and from 
the dust shall rise a new time.’ ” 

‘‘It is written,” Bono murmured. 
He stared up. ‘‘Collapse they will,” 
he said without conviction. ‘‘Sooner 
or later. The question is when. This 
time? Or some other time?” 

Dart answered; ‘‘This is yoMr 
chance, Mycal. It’s a good chance. 
Everything aids you: Jonny’s cour- 
age, Unsler’s senility. You’re the 
man if you want to be. You’re the 
chief of mission.” 

Bono’s close friends thought him 
quiet, sensitive, curious, and 
somewhat retiring. Those who knew 
him less well considered him a sul- 
len, moody man. But unlike other 
sullen, moody men, he was not 
forever ia the lotus posture praying 
for deliverance from Technology. 
He was no zealot. But only Bono 
knew the degree of his own am- 
bivalence about the Activist cause. 

Now he felt the excruciating pain 
of uncertainty. The gigantic penta- 
structure up ahead attracted and re- 

helium 



pelled him in turn. Inwardly he 
scoffed at the crude negotiating 
strategy Jonny Tack had dictated. 
The tribes had waited a thousand 
years for this moment. Did they 
have to implement the plan within a 
month? Couldn’t they get micro- 
welders instead, patiently, piece by 
piece? No, apparently not. Tack 
had no patience with long-range 
strategies. Now! Today! But 
Jonny’s hurry, more than anything 
else, destroyed Bono’s confidence. 
He despaired of success. Yet, at the 
same time, he had accepted the job. 
Why? Pride, he told himself. / 
can’t just disregard the prophesies. 
If this is the time, if the scheme 
succeeds, my name will live in his- 
tory. And yet. 

‘‘No, no, the other way about,” 
Sonder said. ‘‘The vibes enter the 
atom like this. In a spiral. They 
loosen the electronic grip. 
Yes. .like that.” 

Bono said to Dart: ‘‘All right. 
Franco. We’ll see. We might as 
well go in there and see what fate 
holds.” He swivelled in his saddle 
and waved an arm. ‘‘Mount up, 
men,” he called. ‘‘In the name of 
Ecology, let’s go and do it.” 

In a moment the horsemen 
plunged down the side of the rise 
and coaxed their struggling, reluc- 
tant ponies into the vibration-filled 
Desolation. 



THE FIVE-PERCENTER 

Rivera French left the communi- 
cations room of the Bureau of Tri- 
bal Affairs and, accompanied by a 
crew of experts, he travelled by 
Jump tube to the West Tower recep- 

23 




tion hall where, traditionally, BTA 
received Hinterland delegations 
come to negotiate. 

On the way he turned to a 
member of his staff. “Have you 
called the Ambassador?” 

The staff man nodded. 

“And?” 

The man said: “They thanked us 
for the information but said that no 
one would be present at the recep- 
tion.” 

“Did you ask them why? Have 
they been told to stay away, or is it 
Andros Barney playing games?” 

The man said: “They acted very 
reserved. I couldn’t get much out of 
them.” 

“Did you talk to the ambassador 
personally?” 

“Yes. I got the feeling Barney 
resented my calling. He is used to 
dealing with you.” 

French said: “Well, there’s a 
nice start.” 

They arrived in the reception hall 
and found a crowd pressed against 
gold roping hung in slack curves 
from silver posts. Media crews 
stood in readiness with cameras and 
lights near the double-winged por- 
tal. Servants polished wine glasses 
beside a table in the back. Huge 
green banners with the white Ecol- 
ogy symbol in the center hung from 
the walls and trembled in the flow 
of ventilation air. 

The BTA experts arranged them- 
selves in the center — a clump of 
yellow robes. French walked some 
steps ahead of them and took up a 
stance beneath a chandelier, a 
middle-sized, sturdy man in a pur- 
ple robe. He had long blond hair, 
carelessly tossed. His face, tanned 
an orange-brown in the rays of arti- 

24 



sun, revealed his tension in a 
movement of muscles under the 
skin of his cheeks. He pulled down 
on his robe so that it wouldn’t 
bunch above the belt and waited. 

Seven weeks ago word had come 
through intelligence channels that 
the Accommodationist faction of the 
Ecofreak tribe had been ousted by 
the Activist minority. BTA had 
worked five years to prepare for 
this Helium round. That news had 
destroyed five years of work. Union 
marched into this battle blind. No 
Activist had held power in Ecofreak 
since the Helium War of ’ll. Al- 
most nothing was known about Ac- 
tivist personalities, and French was 
both curious and anxious. 

He blamed himself for the situa- 
tion. His intelligence apparatus had 
failed to predict the political shift. 
The chief Negotiator had visibly 
cooled toward French as a 
consequence — and no wonder. Proc- 
tor expected much from this 
negotiating round — and so did 
French. Proctor had formed a rev- 
olutionary group immediately after 
the .series of executions that had 
marked the Dynastic Proclamation 
four years back. Only recently had 
Proctor drawn French into the plot. 
French had joined eagerly, flattered 
by the distinction. Yet now, when 
the time drew near, he’d failed 
Proctor. The Secret Agenda de- 
pended on Ecofreak participation. 

French stood and waited, grow- 
ing impatient. 

Impatience was one of his fail- 
ings. 

Miri always scolded him for it. 
She called him a man who tried to 
leapfrog over himself. “You’re a 
trinity of impatience,” she said. 

GALAXY 




“Impatient in love — you proposed 
to me an hour after we met. impa- 
tient in eating — you bolt your food 
as if you wanted an ulcer. Impatient 
to rise — what do you want to be? 
Unifier?” 

French always answered; “I’d do 
better than Bernie Unsler, girl." 

Miri disapproved of his ambition. 
She came from a high-level family 
and couldn’t understand his slum- 
kid drive for the bigger world. 
Branco was way in the bottom. He 
wanted up, up. Dammit, he wanted 
to rise, and nothing wrong with 
that! The Top was ruled by stupid, 
evil men. You had to rise to right 
the wrongs. 

French had his eyes on the floor 
of the hall. The emblem of the Un- 
sler family was reproduced on the 
white tiles — a red flower complete 
with cup, stem, and a single leaf. 
Ten years ago, when French had 
entered service at age twenty, this 
floor had been covered by Ricardo’s 
ancient symbol, the spiral, depicting 
the flow of gravitron vibrations. 
Unsler had gathered the power, 
both symbolical and real, but now 
his hands grew slack on the reins 
and his son waxed strong. French 
wished Proctor luck with the Secret 
Agenda. Proctor would be a better 
mler than Unsler. 

An attendant by the double- 
winged door, whose eyes had been 
hefted to a narrow observation slit, 
now turned and called back: 
“They’re here.” 

The murmuring crowd fell silent. 
The doors flew open and the Eco- 
freaks came into Ricardo in a 
wedge-shaped formation with Bono 
at their head — it had to be Bono, as 
per dispatch. Hoofs clackered on

Ballantine Books 




So you thought last month’s enor- 
mous science-nction promotion was 
something? Well, you haven't seen 
anything yet. Those nine big, beautiful 
titles we launched on the world are al- 
ready creating quite a stir in the 
industry. .and several of them are 
beginning to sell out their first print- 
ings. We are even making “back-to- 
press” noises to keep the racks filled. 

But that was only the 
beginning; . .the beginning of the big- 
gest and best sf/fantasy promotion 
ever. We'll be publishing 3 super titles 
every month — new books and reissues 
of great old classics that have been out 
of stock for too long. 

And the second installment of Sci- 
ence Fiction '75 leads off this month 
with Poul Anderson’s spirited adven- 
ture fantasy A Midsummer 
Tempest. .best thing we’ve read by 
Poul in many and many a moon. We 
came upon this novel in its hardcover 
incarnation just about a year ago and 
took it along on our trip to last year’s 
Minneapolis science-fiction convention. 
High in the sky — somewhere between 
New York and Minnesota — Anderson’s 
magic worked its charms, and we 
could not wait to gel home and buy tbe 
book for our list. 

Imagine a world in which every 
word written by Shakespeare was lit- 
erally true. .a world in which Prince 
Rupert of the Rhine could fight for 
Charles I of England and escape the 
Puritans by hijacking a railroad 
locomotive — on the right track, but 
200 years before its time! 

“. .Sword, Sorcery, Religion, Lit- 
erature and Love — plus a rattling good 
adventure yarn,’’ said one reviewer; 
“. .a virtuoso performance,’’ said 
‘nother — and we agree with both. 

Now here’s a name to conjure 
with — Darrell Sweet. .(a flourish of 



25 




trumpets is heard in the mind’s ear!). 
He p^ted the cover for the Poui An- 
derson book, and we liked It so much 
we thought to put Darrell under con- 
tract before the competition decided to 
compete for his work. We think he’s 
the find-of-the-year. .and our 
“think” is confirmed by oooohs and 
uaiiahs whenever proofs for one of his 
finished covers arrives in the office. 
He’s already completed seven or eighf 
paintings, and he’s promised to us for 
dozens more. Watch for them! And 
don’t forget the name. .remember, 
you hehrd it here first! 

We do gush on about our artists and 
our covers. .but if the package isn’t 
right the book won’t sell. .or at least 
not as well as it should. So, no wonder 
artists and art directors (hail Ian 
Summers, the noblest art director of 
them all!) are VIP’s around here.

Back on the list after an absence of 
far too long is David Gerrold’s now- 
famous novel When Haiiie Was One. 
HARLIE, as you may recall, was the 
world’s first //uman .Analogue Robot, 
Life /nput Equivalents. In other words 
HARLIE was a computer. .a compu- 
ter who thought he was human. And 
that’s where the trouble began. .and 
then it got worse. Like the time HAR- 
LIE invented — get this! — God! And 
then there was the time. But you’ll 
have to read the book (or reread the 
book) to find out. David tells us there 
will be a sequel coming. .some- 
thing about When Harlie Was Two! 

David, as you may remember, has 
written several books about Star Trek 
for us, each of which has had several 
printings. He’s also the author of 
perhaps the most famous Star Trek 
episodes — all about some furry crea- 
tures that multiply endlessly — or the 
mutated variety that grow and grow 
and GROW. And that brings us to the 
next book on the list Star Trek Log 
Four, adaptations of everyone’s favor- 
ite television series by our own Alan 
Dean Foster! One of the episodes in the 
new books is — ^you guess^ it — “More 
Tribbles, More Troubles.”

the tiles. The ponies were small, 
hairy mutants and had frightened 
eyes. The tribesmen blinked in the 
floodlights of Media. 

The noble tribe of Ecofreak. 
They were the largest and most 
powerful among the peoples of Hin- 
terland, French reflected. They al- 
ways came on horseback — matter of 
principle. At home they used tech- 
nology with relish. But when they 
came before the Enemy, they pre- 
tended to be purer than the pure. 

The delegation stopped before 
him, and Freneh bowed low be- 
neath the chandelier. The smell of 
horses brought to mind memories of 
clandestine Hinterland missions. 

He watched Bono swing out of 
the saddle and observed the supple 
grace of the man, the fierce expres- 
sion on the face. Bono moved like 
a herdsman — probably owned whole 
countries of silvery land speckled 
with cattle, white Harvey hare, and 
the black prairie birds tribesmen 
called ‘carry’ after carrion. Bono’s 
spurs rang on the tiles as he ap- 
proached. The Crestmore bible on 
his belt swung on a tarnished silver 
chain. 

As they shook hands, French ob- 
served the faee closely. Bono’s nar- 
rowed eyes were cool, unfriendly. 
Bushy brows, hooked nose, a 
sharply sculptured, forked blaek 
beard. Aggression. Yet French also 
sensed a disturbing shyness in the 
man. Shy men are poor negotiators, 
it went though his mind. 

They exchanged traditional greet- 
ings under blazing Media lights. 

“Welcome to Ricardo, Chief 
Bono, the Pearl of Union. May 
your stay be profitable.” 

Bono answered: “We come 

GALAXY 




under duress, Mr. French, and pro- 
test the threat of your missiles.” 

And French: ‘‘We threaten no 
one but ask only for that which we 
need to live.” 

French led Bono to the waiting 
BTA experts and introduced them 
one by one. Then Bono did the 
same in turn, surreptitiously assess- 
ing the young Deputy Assistant. 
The innocent charm of the man, 
those curls and locks of blond hair, 
that cleft in the chin, that small, 
pulpy nose, that dimple in the 
cheek, his whole look of careless, 
twinkling bravado disguised a tough 
and able man. Bono recalled 
French’s history, had read it over 
again on the flight north. 

French was a vegetable smuggler 
from a notorious slum-level in East 
Tower who, by dint of native 
abilities and a fortunate marriage to 
a high-level girl (he’d met her in 
Branco, which was a kind of artist’s 
haunt, among other things), had 
been lifted up and educated. In the 
service of the Bureau of Tribal Af- 
fairs, he used his pugnacious skills 
against the tribes. Some years back 
he’d earned fame among the tribes 
as a reckless agent. They’d called 
him ‘starface’ in Hinterland after a 
small scar on his forehead that he 
covered up with make-up when in 
the field. Now French was chief of 
intelligence, although he carried the 
title of DA for Public Affairs. 

A shrill neigh made them look 
up. The ponies had begun to panic 
in the gravitron vibrations. They 
reared, screamed, and kicked in all 
directions. Tribesmen rushed to aid 
a youngster who fought to control 
the animals. The crowd laughed at 
the turbulence. It took a moment to 



unload the pack animals. Then a 
youngster leaped into the saddle, 
gave Bono the raised-fist salute of 
the tribes, and with a cry drove the 
horses toward the entrance.. They 
disappeared in a cloud of dust. 

French met the last of the tribes- 
men and recognized one of them at 
last — not by appearance but by 
name. Franco Dart was a small, 
old, wrinkled little man with sus- 
picious eyes. French knew him as 
one of Old Tack’s not-so-brilliant 
associates. He’d been a member of 
the Ecofreak embassy many years 
back, a first or second secretary, 
one of the few Activists with a pro- 
file in BTA’s computers. 

French turned to Bono. ‘‘Shall 
we toast your safe arrival?” 

Bono gave a stiff little bow. ‘‘At 
your service.” 

They walked to the table at the 
back. Their followers came behind 
them like a comet’s tail, while the 
crowd gaped and savored the traces 
of rank horse smell left behind by 
the departed herd. 

Against the back of the hall hung 
circular emblems of all Hinterland 
tribes — Maoling, Peacefreak, 

Narodnik, Twin River Compromise, 
Bluegrass Territory, Planetfriends, 
Gulfrats, Ecofreak, and others. 
French pointed to them, but Bono 
couldn’t see them properly. 

Moments before he had begun to 
see double. Now murmurs in his 
stomach signalled the onset of 
nausea. The clammy feel of cold 
sweat spread from his armpits and 
neck over his body. His hands 
trembled as he took the glass of 
bubbly wine and his tongue slurred 
the words as he responded to 
French’s toast.

Waiters brought sandwiches on 
trays, but Bono shook his head. 

French turned to Bono. “I don’t 
see anyone from the Ecofreak em- 
bassy. We notified them of your ar- 
rival. Did you tell them to stay 
away? 

Bono nodded. “Barney is not of 
our party. We don’t expect him to 
play a role in these negotiations.” 
“Why hasn’t he been replaced?” 
“He shall be,” Bono replied. 
“In due time.” 

“I must say the sudden change in 
leadership caught all of us by sur- 
prise here.” 

Bono didn’t answer. He stared 
into his half-empty glass. He 
blinked in the characteristic manner 
of a man with gravitron bends, sur- 
prising French. 

“Tell me. Chief Bono. Is this 
your first time in a structure?” 

The tribesman nodded. 

“In that case you’ve still got it in 
front of you.” 

“The Adjustment?” 

French nodded. “But it isn’t all 
that bad. It takes less than a week. 
By the time of the opening ball, 
you’ll be completely attuned.” 

Bono said; ‘T suppose we 
couldn’t skip the opening ball?” 
French smiled. “Impossible, 
Chief. Tradition is tradition. Recep- 
tions, balls, rituals. How can we 
hide a man of your distinction from 
the curious eyes of the ladies? Some 
of your countrymen are very gal- 
lant.” 

Bono heard French but could not 
concentrate on the conversation. He 
felt an unreasoning rage and longed 
to give it expression. 

“I’m a strict constructionist,” he 
said. “I shun frivolity.” 

28 



Bono’s feelings about the subject 
were more complex than that, but in 
the eyes of the blond DA he prefer- 
red to appear to be a conven- 
tional Activist. 

French answered: “A good rule, 
by and large. Let me assure you 
that Union respects your wishes. 
But the opening ball is absolutely 
unavoidable. The tradition goes way 
back. ...” 

He saw an expression of pain 
flash across Bono’s features. 

“Are you starting to feel it al- 
ready?” 

Bono’s rage grew and grew. 
Pressure choked him. The feeling 
was entirely physical. His mind and 
spirit were benevolently inclined 
toward French, but something made 
him want to strike out. 

“H-how can you stand it,” he 
brought forth. 

“Th-this. .V- vibration.” His hand 
described a circle. Wine spilled. 
Servants rushed in to wipe up the 
mess. “Are you p-people mad? 
When will you 1-leave your er-rant 
ways!” 

French looked at him indulgently. 
“Where would you have us go? 
Where should we put our millions? 
The tribes have all the desirable 
land. Shoii of atomics, how could 
we prevail against you? We like the 
High Culture — we also like com- 
pression. We don’t force you to live 
here. It’s to your advantage to 
maintain Union. You’ve got no use 
for Helium. And neither of us 
wants the alternative.” 

He noted a pulse of pain in 
Bono’s face. The man’s elbows 
jerked outward. 

French added: “You’ll get used 
to it. In five days you’ll be ad- 

GALAXY 




justed. You won’t even feel the 
vibes.” 

A five-percenter, French told 
himself. Or else he couldn’t feel it 
yet. 

Bono was preoccupied. His lips 
trembled as he tried to form words. 

‘‘I. .don’t u-understand. .it. 
Y-your life span. .is fifty-five at 
best. You deliv-delib-berately. 
deliverately. ...” 

“Yes?” French prompted. 

”. .k-killing yourselves,” Bono 
completed. 

Then he took himself in control. 
His eyes gained focus. His cheeks 
stiffened under the beard. Bono 
took a step toward the table. His 
feet seemed heavy. He placed his 
glass on the white table cloth with a 
studied gesture. 

Turning to French, he spoke very 
slowly. “With your permission, 
Mr. French, we’ll now take our 
leave. We’ve had a long flight and 
an even longer ride.” 

French bowed. “Of course, 
Chief. As you wish. Jump tubes are 
waiting outside. Until you and your 
associates have learned to operate 
them, one of my men will guide 
you by remote control.” 

THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR 

The Bureau of Tribal Affairs oc- 
cupied nearly one quarter of Level 
125 or Old Top, so called because 
it had been the summit of Central 
Tower until the end of the seventh 
century when Helium-cooling had 
dramatically improved grav-drum 
performance and two hundred new 
levels, spacious in the extreme, 
each with several storeys, had been 
added to the tower. 

HELIUM 



Nevertheless, there clung to Old 
Top a certain hoary magnificence, a 
memory of wealth and of rooftop 
gardens open to the public, from 
whence structure folk had gazed out 
over the Atlantic or Hinterland 
through pressure-sealed glass. 

BTA’s current quarters had been 
the Lord Mayor’s domain, and the 
Lord Mayor’s former office now be- 
longed to Reston Proctor. Wood 
panelling nearly black with age 
formed three walls of the spacious 
room. Slender white columns a 
meter from the wall held up a vault- 
ed ceiling from which the irrides- 
cent colors of an exquisite mi- 
cromosaic reflected light. The outer 
side of the office, beyond the col- 
umns, was an outjutting terrace shut 
off by floor-to-ceiling drilla-glass. 
From that terrace Proctor could look 
across at West Tower or down at 
the intertower beltway that linked 
Center to West like a slack hose of 
translucent silver filled with motion 
at all times of day and night. 

Proctor sat behind his desk and, 
over its cluttered surface, he 
watched the screen of a visiset that 
had been rolled in over the heavy 
red carpet leaving a trail on the soft 
fibers. His face was pensive, eyes 
impassive. He wore the shimmering 
blue robe of a Big, the sleeves 
rolled up to the elbows. Proctor was a 
short, heavy man whose powerful 
neck, barrel-like torso, massive 
round head, heavy jowls, and an 
abnormally large and outjutting chin 
suggested the legendary rhinoceros. 

He sat surrounded by mementoes 
of his rise to power. Models of 
missiles on his desk marked his 
years in Defense. On the walls 
hung certificates of appointment to 

29 




ever higher jobs in various parts of 
the bureaucracy — Defense, Com- 
merce, Public Order, Media, 
Health. Between these framed and 
ornamented pieces of scriptoplast 
under glass, and on little tables 
strewn about the room between 
armchairs and couches, were signed 
photographs of virtually every 
member of the Unsler clan, includ- 
ing an inordinately large holo- 
graphic representation of Unsler him- 
self. It hung by itself on a wall be- 
hind Proctor’s desk. On a golden 
plaque set into the gilded frame of 
the picture was an inscription re- 
produced from the Unifier’s hand: 
“To the best damn administrator 
who has ever served our noble 
cause, Bernie.’’ 

In the visiscreen tribesmen stepped 
into upright jump tubes parked 
in rows outside the reception hall. 
Proctor watched them. 

The flat remorite on his desk lit 
up; a slip of scripto extruded from 
its slit. Proctor reached to get it. 
His secretary had written on it: 
‘Blottingham insists that you brief 
him (telcall is enough) on your as- 
sessment of the delegation.’ 

Proctor crumpled the note in a 
meaty fist. He held it for a second 
thinking of pear-shaped Blottingham 
whose power increased as Unsler’s 
declined. Then he threw the slip 
into the dusto and wrote a note for 
Mrs. Sedlig. It said: ‘Call Blotting- 
ham and tell him to jump down a 
shaft. Tell him verbatim.’ Below he 
penned a large, bold P. He stuck 
the slip into the remorite, leaned 
back in his throne-like chair, crossed 
his thick arms across his chest, 
and turned his attention back to the 
screen. 

30 



But his concentration wandered, 
his mind excercised by Blottingham’s 
peremptory message. 

Well, he thought, so far as I’m 
concerned, Unsler can do what he 
bloody well pleases. 

Proctor felt strong for the mo- 
ment. He wouldn’t jump every time 
Unsler’s pear-shaped staff-chief 
whistled. The Helium round was 
underway — a poor time to change 
the Chief Negotiator. 

A few more weeks, he thought. A 
few more weeks. 

Proctor shifted position. His blunt 
fingers drummed on the desk as he 
watched the tribesmen. Terrified. 
They were terrified. They gripped 
the waist-high tube rails as the jump 
tubes rose above the movebelts. 
They looked manageable enough, 
these youngish men. Proctor had 
hopes that they’d deliver the brief 
Interdicition he needed to carry out 
the plan. Of course, one never 
knew. 

The deep, melodious chime of 
his tel sounded. French! 

He reached for the small-screened 
tel to his right, punched a button. 
French came on. Behind him, 
through the telbooth glass, Proctor 
saw two BTA staffers talking. 

“Just a minute,’’ Proctor rum- 
bled. He reached for the black cube 
of his intercept. A spiderweb of 
wires trembled on top of the device. 
He touched its sides, and the cube 
turned red. 

“Have you got your intercept 
on?’’ he asked. 

French nodded. 

“Very well,’’ Proctor said, “tell 
me what I already know.’’ 

French chuckled and gave his re- 
port while Proctor wondered how 

GALAXY 




these men would react to his pro- 
posal. After a while he broke in. 

“How does Bono strike you?” 

“Fanatical, uncomplicated, prob- 
ably rigid. But it’s too early to 
tell. Res. You saw his behavior. 
He’s a five-percenter, and I’d wager 
he’ll have a tough Adjustment. 
Grav-bends make people act 
strangely.” 

Proctor said: “I’m watching him 
now. He’s jerky, all right. His eyes 
are erratic.” 

“Another thing, Res. He calls 
himself a strict constructionist, 
claims to dislike frivolity — by 
which I guess he means the social 
side of things.” 

Proctor, eyes on the screen, nod- 
ded and turned to French. “Our 
women are the devil’s brood? Pol- 
lute the tribal blood?” 

French smiled. “Now, Res, I 
don’t think I’d go as far as that. 
That’d be the extreme form of the 
disease.” 

Proctor recalled the last Ecofreak 
delegation, said: “It would be 
refreshing — after the debaucheries 
of ’51.” 

French laughed. “I wouldn’t ex- 
pect high moral tone, if I were you. 
Tack’s followers can’t be entirely 
opposed to mingling. OT is dead, 
you know. Remember the ‘grand al- 
liance’?” 

Proctor frowned. 

The five-year-old episode still re- 
verberated. In 1051 Jonny Tack had 
come to Ricardo with the Helium 
delegation. A technical advisor, or 
some such thing. Soon a passionate 
love affair had bloomed between 
Regina Unsler and the young man, 
despite the Crestmore prohibitions 
against the mingling of tribal and 

HELIUM 



structure seed. Had been an insane, 
trying time, that. Unsler had seen in 
this romance a new opportunity for 
expanding his power. For weeks 
frantic negotiations had been carried 
out under his orders to forih a 
Grand Alliance between Union and 
Hinterland by intermarriage. Proctor 
belonged to the hard-line school. 
He had opposed the venture even as 
he’d led the negotiations, but fortu- 
nately the Accommodation policy, 
as it came to be called — favored 
both by Unsler and the Ecofreak 
council — was scotched by the inter- 
vention of the Older TacL 

“Don’t remind me,” Proctor said 
to French. “That was one time 
when I was grateful for the late OT. 
He made short work of that 
romance. What about strategy? 
Did you get any hints?” 

In the screen the tribesmen had 
reached West Tower’s central shaft. 
The tubes rose quickly with the up- 
thrust traffic, bottom jets ablaze. 
The tribesmen were afraid. None 
looked down into the chasm and 
none looked up. None gaped at the 
many tubes, the movement of pod- 
shaped elevators, or at the common 
people moving up and down on 
hundreds of slide bars, arms and 
legs wrapped about the darkish 
rods. The men stared ahead with 
rigid expressions, terrified but much 
too proud to show it. 

French said: “Bono said nothing. 
I haven’t polled the staff yet. But I 
still stand by my predictions. 
They’ll try to wreck us economi- 
cally. Activists can’t have any other 
strategy. The question is why they 
came to power. If we could answer 
that question, we’d know a good 
deal more. For the moment, the 

31 




best I can do is speculate, and I 
predict that they’ll try for a Very 
Big as hostage — someone from the 
Meyer family, say. Then I expect 
that they’ll ask for half of our plas- 
tosteel production, which would 
mean the end of expansion, popula- 
tion control. Unsler couldn’t survive 
that. But I expect that they’ll settle 
for thirty percent. If, that is. 
If. .’’ 

Proctor looked back at the 
telscreen. “If we make a credible 
military gesture.’’ 

French nodded. 

Proctor was silent. How to strike 
a deal with Activists? Their objec- 
tive was total destruction — and he 
couldn’t give them that. He had to 
find something they really wanted, 
something short of total war but 
more than economic damage. 
Perhaps he’d give them Portia struc- 
ture in the north-west, a hotbed of 
Unsler support. 

He had to find a deal. The plot 
probably leaked like a sieve. The 
Group couldn’t be held together for 
another five years. 

“We must get a better feel for 
their strategy,’’ he rumbled. “See if 
you can talk to the ambassador in a 
day or two. Barney must be un- 
happy with this bunch. He might 
play with us.” 

“//they tell him' anything. I ex- 
pect he’ll be frozen out. Bono said 
as much.” 

“Barney can’t be cut out that 
easily. And it doesn’t hurt to try.” 

“I’ll do it,” French said, nod- 
ding. 

“And you better close the loop 
with our people in the regions. I 
don’t want surprises on the other 
coasts.” 



French nodded. 

“Call personally.” 

“Will do.” 

“And let’s talk about this tomor- 
row morning.” 

Through the telbooth glass Proc- 
tor saw the BTA staff people con- 
clude their conversation. They 
waved to each other and passed out 
of sight. They reminded him of 
something. 

“Rivera,” he said, “one more 
thing. Have you talked with Darby 
Dickens today?” 

French shook his head. 

“We lost two more people to 
flame attacks last night.” 

“You’re kidding.” 

“I’m serious,” Proctor asserted. 
“Ten deaths in as many weeks. 
That far exceeds chance.” 

“Do you think Sidney is deliber- 
ately picking on BTA?” 

“Of course, I do! And I think 
it’s more than that. I think the 
flames are getting encouragement 
from Top Level. If this keeps up, 
I’ll have to retaliate. Top Level is 
pressuring us — through the flames.” 
“Your popularity?” 

Proctor stared into the screen, 
communicating with his eyes. 
“That. .and perhaps other 
things.” French understood. The 
Secret Agenda. “Be careful,” Proc- 
tor continued. “Don’t move about 
alone. Always take some men with 
you on the movebelts, especially at 
night. I can’t afford to lose you 
now.” 

A grin lit up French’s face; his 
dimples showed. “I can take care 
of myself.” 

Proctor’s eyes turned angry. 
“Balderdash,” he rumbled. French 
still behaved as if he were a Branco 



32 



GALAXY 




gangster. “Take people with you 
when you move about. Tell Darby 
to assign you a guard.” 

“I’ll think about it.” 

“No, Rivera, do it. The conflict 
may deepen now that Ecofreak is 
here. I just insulted Blottingham. 
He also belongs to that group 
peripherally.” 

French nodded, amused and flat- 
tered by Proctor’s concern. He had 
been on sixteen Hinterland missions 
and had come back alive. He was a 
Branco kid. Sidney’s flames might 
harrass the people all over the Ac- 
ropolis, but they stayed away from 
Branco. A few noble sadists 
wouldn’t have a chance against 
him. 

“And come see me in the morn- 
ing,” Proctor said. 

“First thing.” 

Proctor punched a button, and 
French became a single fading dot 
of light in the tiny screen. 

INTO THE TUB 

Bono stood before the embassy 
door and pressed the bell. Faintly 
from within came the first six notes 
of Woodstock. The door opened 
and he entered a terazzoed lobby 
followed by his retinue. A curved 
stairway led up to a second level 
where Barney stood tall and grave 
dressed in a white robe like a Very 
Big. His white hair fell down 
straight, structure style. 

Bono walked up the stairs toward 
Barney. Pressure squeezed his lungs 
and eyes. Terror gripped his mind. 
His feet were lead. He had the urge 
to gasp for air in huge, noisy 
bursts, but he suppressed it. Barney 
seemed far away, blurred. 

helium 



Barney looked down at the ap- 
proaching Bono. How young he is! 
And the delegation-a tableau of in- 
experience. 

He said: “Welcome, Mycal 
Bono, welcome to Ricardo.” 

Bono blinked. Barney was an 
Accommodationist and a man who, 
through the years, had lived in 
structures as Ecofreak’s representa- 
tive. A man you couldn’t trust. 
Nevertheless Barney looked kindly. 
His hand was large and warm. 
Crows feet extended like rays from 
his greenish, solicitous eyes. Be- 
hind the ambassador, reflected in 
mirrors, Bono saw the embassy 
staff assembled to receive them. 

He nodded to Barney, afraid to 
speak lest his leaden tongue slur the 
words. 

“I knew your father well,” said 
Barney. “We fought together 
against Maoling in the war of 
1009 .” 

Barney wondered how youngsters 
like these could have wrested the 
power from Franklin, Denton, Ruff 
and the others. Jonny Tack had de- 
manded much in the way of infor- 
mation from the embassy, but he’d 
provided nothing in return since the 
shift. These youngsters would have 
to bring him up to date, whether 
they wished to or not. Something 
very big must have happened back 
home to vault the tiny splinter 
minority into the political saddle. 

Then, noting the rigid look on 
Bono’s face and surprised that the 
man clung to his hand, it dawned 
on Barney what the problem was. 

I must be getting insensitive in 
my old age. 

Simultaneously, he saw Bono’s 
elbows Jerk outward, saw the head 

33 




fly back, saw the chief take in air 
with a violent gasp. Barney felt a 
surge of pity for the miserable 
youngster. 

“Smith, Duffy,” he commanded 
sharply over his shoulder. ‘‘We 
have a five-percenter. Get the tub 
ready.” 

As the two men ran off, he 
turned back to Bono. 

“Relax, son. You’ll be all right. 
We’ll take care of you.” 

He put an arm around Bono’s 
shoulder and, dispensing with 
ceremonial, he guided the youngster 
through a corridor formed by the 
curious embassy staff. He walked 
slowly, knowing that Bono’s feet 
must feel heavy. 

Regardless of his ideology, he 
thought, a man’s a man, and if he 
is a five -percenter, he deserves both 
pity and care. Will he be ready for 
the ball? Should I seek a postpone- 
ment? 

They went up a flight of stairs. 
Bono gasped without restraint now 
in that imitation of an epileptic fit 
that gravitron imposed on some. 
The worst part of it was the embar- 
rassement. Adjustment reduced a 
man to a pitiful caretaker of a de- 
fective biomachine. 

Up ahead, in an open corridor, 
closed off by a wooden rail. Smith 
and Duffy carried small sacks in 
hand — red gelatin. They scurried 
along. Barney heard the rush of 
water from the bath. 

“It’ll be all right,” he assured 
Bono again. “A minute or two, and 
we’ll get you relief.” 

He looked back at the group 
which had followed, a mixture of 
staff and delegates. He searched for 
his secretary. His eyes snagged on 

34 



Franco Dart. Now there was a 
familiar face. He nodded to Dart, a 
plan half forming in his mind. 

“Martha,” he called, seeing the 
woman at last, “get me a sedative 
and a glass of water.” 

He moved Bono slowly along 
toward the sound of water. 

Bono let himself be led, his ter- 
ror diminished. He let himself go. 
Mentally he gave himself over en- 
tirely to the care of others. In the 
bathroom, with water rushing into 
the tub, Barney told him to undress. 
He complied and stood naked on 
cold tiles, shuddering and shivering 
in fits. Two men stirred a red pow- 
der into steaming water. Bono 
smelled plastosteel and inferred that 
the red color of the powder came 
from that. His arms and chest were 
covered by goosepimples. The 
sheen of his skin was blueish be- 
neath the tan. 

The bathroom door opened a 
crack. A hand reached in holding a 
cup of water, some pills. 

“Take these,” Barney told him. 

Bono obediently swallowed. 

“And now into the tub with 
you,” Barney said. 

REGINA 

In the late afternoon Sidney had 
jumped off the lip of his North 
Tower domain and after a long 
freefall through North shaft had 
landed by parachute in the Pit. 

At his insistance Regina had been 
present. When the riots erupted, 
her bodyguard formed a ring about 
her and brought her back to Top 
Level West, considerably shaken. 

She asked Selma, her favorite 
maid, to call St. Theresa of Carmen 

GALAXY 




on Level 188 Central and ask that 
Sister Serenita be sent to her at 
once. 

Serenita came, a tall, severe old 
woman in a huge winged coif and 
blue robe. They retired to the medi- 
tation chamber of Regina’s exten- 
sive domain. Regina lay down on 
the couch and Serenita, seated be- 
side her, read to her calmly from 
the Biblibooks until Regina fell 
asleep. 

Selma awakened her some time 
later. Serenita had gone back to the 
convent again. Regina was momen- 
tarily confused. She had dreamed 
about Serenita, a confused jumble. 
The nun had spoken about the Great 
Change, whatever that signified. 
There had been some business with 
a turquoise ring. 

Selma was excitable, and her 
eyes opened wide and resembled 
fried eggs. 

“Mistress,” she cried, shaking 
Regina, “come quickly. We’ve 
spied some tribesmen near the De- 
solation. It must be them!” 

They ran through the chambers of 
Regina’s domain and passed 
through a glass door to spiral stairs 
that led up to a rooftop garden cov- 
ered by many small domes of 
drilla-glass. In the west the sun 
reddened the horizon, but there was 
light enough to see the clump of 
horsemen through telescopes. Pres- 
ently the tribesmen plunged down 
the side of a small rise, and soon 
they were obscured by dust. 

Regina sighed and walked pen- 
sively back through the lush tropical 
vegetation of her garden, down the 
gravelled path, to the spiral stairs, 
stirred into memories of Jonny 
Tack. 

helium 



She said to Selma: “Roll a vis- 
iset into my favorite room. I’ll 
watch them on the evening news. 
Meanwhile I’ll take a bath.” 

Selma Said: “Mistress, Clafto 
Meyer called while you slept and 
said he must speak with you.” 

Regina frowned and didn’t an- 
swer. 

Mention of Clafto set her brood- 
ing, and she still pouted in her 
marble bath, lounging in the re- 
cessed, oval pool while fountains 
played all around her. Mounds of 
foam lay on the water, and she 
flicked the fluffy icebergs toward 
the cone-mountains of her deeply 
tanned knees. 

She thought of the abject slavery 
Sidney imposed on her by his 
brotherly violence, her father’s in- 
accessibility, and swarthy Clafto 
“Who, chosen as Sidney’s latest 
favorite, now demanded the use of 
her body. 

Then, with a rush of reassurance, 
she remembered something Serenita 
had said the other day. 

Serenita had said: “Darling girl, 
I pray for you daily. I commend 
you to the Virgin Mother Mary, “the 
Star of the Sea. She has turned her 
face from me for a long time, seal- 
ing her ears to my prayers, but yes- 
terday she smiled. I do believe she 
has now heard me, and you’ll be 
granted your dearest wish.” 

Regina sighed in the pool. Then 
she rose and water pearled down 
her body. The scent of her bath oil 
lay on the air. Her chemist had 
concocted it for her. No other oil in 
Union had the same lubricity or the 
same fey smell. She tingled with 
pleasure all over as she rubbed her- 
self dry. Her nighty, genuine silk 

35 




from Maoling, snuggled softly 
against her flesh. She wormed her 
feet into half slippers and they beat 
on her soles as she walked to her 
favorite room, a circular cubicle cut 
off at one end by a full-length, 
gold-laced mirror. She dropped 
down on the low divan where she 
and Jonny had striven in love, their 
bodies reflected darkly in the glass. 
She reached for a sugared crisp- 
strip in a white bowl and activated 
the visiset Selma had rolled into the 
room. 

Jonny Tack. She remembered 
him vaguely, alas. Five years had 
wiped off everything except a few 
great strokes. He was tall and pow- 
erful. He shaved his head except for 
a spot on top of his skull from 
which had sprung a long horse-tail 
of hair. Jonny had never smiled. He 
had been rough, tumultuous in love. 
His blue eyes had glazed when he’d 
desired. Once satisfied, he’d always 
cursed her, calling her a wanton 
temptress, black of mood and tor- 
tured by some kind of guilt. But he 
came back always after a while. 

The news had not yet begun, and 
Regina looked at herself in the mir- 
ror. 

She was aristocratically tall. Her 
legs were pulled up and half hidden 
by pillows. The grey-blue nighty 
was low-cut between firm breasts 
and decorated with yellow stars 
whose points were long like lights 
seen through drilla-glass. Her high 
cheeks now showed a bloom. Her 
pouting lips were full. Her eyes had 
the brooding look of one who’d 
loved and lost. She adjusted her red 
hair. It now hung down to her 
shoulders, although ordinarily it 
would have been piled high to show 

36 



the swan-like arch of a delicate 
neck. 

She thought: I've become a 
woman since those days. 

She reached for and crunched 
another sugared crisp-strip between 
white teeth. In mid-bite she 
stopped, the strip protruding be- 
tween her lips. 

For a second she had thought 
she’d seen a tribesman, but it 
turned out to be merely a man in a 
beaded jacket advertising an ethnic 
eatery. 

She crunched up the strip and 
licked her lip with the tip of a pink 
tongue. 

The news came at last. The word 
‘Helium’ flashed on and off at the 
bottom of the screen. She saw pic- 
tures of the tribesmen on horseback, 
in the reception hall under the blaze 
of chandeliers, in jump tubes travel- 
ling through the Acropolis. 

The commentator said: “Mycal 
Bono, Ecofreak’s negotiator, ar- 
rived in Ricardo tonight. He was 
met by Rivera French, a high- 
ranking BTA official. Mr. Bono 
had no comment for Media. He re- 
tired at once to the Ecofreak em- 
bassy in East Tower. Observers 
here expressed surprise at Bono’s 
youth. Concern has been voiced 
that Union’s Helium needs will de- 
pend on the sagacity and skill of so 
inexperienced a man, a virtual un- 
known. Reston Proctor, Union’s 
chief negotiator, sees no basis for 
concern and once more denies per- 
sistent rumors that this round of 
negotiations will be hotly contested. 
Reliable sources within the Bureau, 
however, privately concede that 
rough times are ahead. Contingency 
plans have been dusted off and 

GALAXY 




stand-by air liquefaction units are 
reportedly on stream. Proctor him- 
self is reported gloomy about pros- 
pects. He felt hemmed in by the 
Accommodation policy and darkly 
hints that ‘the worst’ may happen 
on this round. Top Level spokes- 
men refuse to comment at this early 
stage and reaffirmed the Unifier’s 
absolute confidence in Proctor.” 

Regina barely listened. She gazed 
with fixed concentration at the 
flashing images of Mycal Bono. His 
dark, brooding eyes and black, 
forked beard made her pensive. 

/ could fall in love with him, she 
thought. / like that name. .Mycal. 
It’s the name of an archangel in 
Serenita’s Biblibooks. He isn’t like 
Jonny, of course, but he seems 
more. .sensitive. A little sad, / 
think. 

‘‘In other news. ...” 

A sealing crew maneuvered a 
section of plastosteel into a gaping 
hole of Portia structure. The struc- 
ture renewal had gone smoothly. In 
Laystruc four mushtanks had been 
poisoned, and Media showed 
emergency supplies brought in by 
air from Frisco. Several jumpball 
innovations were shown. 

Regina plotted. The opening ball 
was a week away. She decided to 
wear a green sheer-gown for the 
occasion, the one with the coiling 
snakes all oriented suggestively 
(their split tongues extended) to- 
ward her center. She’d spread pink 
tint across her eyelids and hang her 
neck with silver bells. She’d daub 
Volcano behind her ears, across her 
wrists, in the crook of her arms. 
Her cosmetician said that Volcano 
yaporized in body heat. ‘‘It’s like 
incense burned in your blood,” the 

helium 



woman had said, presenting the 
phial. ‘‘Just for you,” the woman 
had said. No other lady in Union 
could afford the price. 

‘‘In another spirited display of 
leadership courage, Sidney Unsler, 
the Underunifier, today demon- 
strated the art of parachuting. ...” 

Angrily, Regina looked up at the 
screen. 

Sidney stood at the lip of the 
shaft, a foolish grin on his long 
face. Torches smoked in his gloved 
hands. He leaped out over the 
chasm lip, torches held high and 
away from his body at an angle. 
His motion imitated that of a diver. 

For a dizzying moment the 
cameras followed Sidney’s spread- 
eagled freefall through the lighted 
shaft, an infinite depth down. Then 
cameras deployed on lower levels 
picked him up as he came, his 
torches blazing, a dot that became a 
man, that flashed by like a bullet. 
Next they showed the parachute furl 
out of his backpack pulled by a 
lead. The striped silk cracked open 
and Sidney swung down. Finally, 
they showed him standing at Pit 
level, an idiotic pained grin on his 
face. The collapsed chute could be 
seen trailing from his harness and 
out of the picture. 

A Media reporter interviewed 
Sidney. Sidney prattled about the 
exhilaration of freefall. 

Regina jabbed the visi control 
and the picture went blank. 

They hadn’t shown the deaths 
and the riot. Sidney had collided 
with three unsuspecting people in 
jump tubes. Two girls had lost con- 
trol and had fallen with terrible 
screams to the bottom. His 
parachute had pulled four children 

37 




from slide bars around level 70. 
They too had died. Rioting people 
had erupted from severaf levels and, 
crowding the slide bars, had de- 
scended to Pit bent on revenge. Re- 
gina had been down-bound in a 
tube. Police had stopped her. Down 
below they’d battled to save 
Sidney’s life. 

She thought: How I despise him, 
how I loathe him! She slipped her 
feet into her fluffy half slippers; 
they slapped her heels as she strode 
off to bed. She thought: 7 must 
marry into the tribes before Daddy 
dies and Sidney takes over. Bless 
him, she thought, meaning her 
father. Bless Accommodation. 

U 

SILCOPLAST 

Tradition decreed a one-week gap 
between a tribal reception and the 
opening ball — time enough for the 
Adjustment, time enough to renew 
acquaintances, to get an informal 
feel for the other side’s negotiating 
position. 

In 1056 the Ecofreak delegation 
kept to itself. Bono was a five- 
percenter and lay in the tub. The 
delegates were new and had no 
friends in Union. 

Only Dart had had structure ex- 
perience, but his last stay in 
Ricardo went fifteen years back. He 
had time on his hands, and he used 
it to look at the Acropolis. 

He toured Ricardo with a young 
tribal attache and found the city 
much the same as he had left it 
— physically. The pentastructure 
was fixed in design and couldn’t be 
transformed like a tribal settlement. 
But details had changed. The 
crowds were thicker and the physi- 

38 



cal plant seemed poorly maintained 
except at higher levels, of course. 
In Dart’s day Ricardo had been a^ 
riot of psychedelic color, musicJ 
and sensuality, of which only traces 
remained. / 

The mood of the place was sub-j 
dued somehow, and when he asket^ 
his guide the reason why, the 
youngster ascribed it to rot at the 
top: “Unsler is old and ailing. His 
brain is turning to mush. He clings 
to power but won’t excercise it. His 
aides act for him, and his precious 
son rages through Ricardo un- 
checked. Things have really de- 
teriorated since the Proclamation 
when Bernie made his son Under- 
runifier. That was followed by ex- 
ecutions and much mayhem of that 
sort. Life in the structures is differ- 
ent from life at home. Here every- 
thing is integrated. When the chief 
is sick, everyone sickens.” 

Dart answered a little huffily: 
‘‘You don’t need to tell me that. 
I’m an old structure hand myself.” 
One time they toured a lower 
level and Dart saw an urchin selling 
hand-printed scriptos. Such things 
were illegal; Media controlled all 
communications. Dart bought a 
copy of the rag and found it filled 
with the gruesome escapades of 
someone called Fink. 

The embassy aide explained. 
‘‘Fink is their word for Sidney Un- 
sler, and it’s a mild word, if you 
ask me. Sidney is a degenerate. He 
thinks he is the reincarnated person 
of a mythical hero or god, someone 
called Julius Caesar. Young up- 
level nobles have formed a cult 
brotherhood around Sidney. They 
call themselves flames and call him 
Ignis, meaning Fire in latin. They 

GALAXY 




all study latin and use the tongue in 
secret conversations. They have in- 
itiations and fight duels with short 
Roman swords and round shields in 
a room set aside for that purpose in 
Sidney’s domain. All this wouldn’t 
bother a soul, but they also maraud 
through Ricardo at night — drunk, as 
a rule. They rape and loot for the 
sheer hell of it, and the police look 
the other way, of course. You can 
imagine Union’s future. Sidney 
takes over when mushbrain dies.” 

‘‘I take it you don’t like the Un- 
slers.” 

The young man laughed. “No, 
indeed!” 

“You should be pleased. A weak 
Union means a strong tribe.” 

“I’m an Accommodationist my- 
self,” the young man said, sud- 
denly brusque. “It gives me a pain 
to see the High Culture decay.” 

Hearing this. Dart cancelled the 
evening excursion they’d planned. 
He didn’t want to be associated 
with a vocal Accommodationist 
— and the entire embassy was rid- 
dled with them. Only one man, 
Dulsol, the chief of maintenance, 
appeared sympathetic with the Ac- 
tivist cause. 

Dart sat in the embassy’s library 
that evening when Barney ap- 
proached him and suggested dinner 
for old times’ sake. He left the 
choice of restaurants to Dart. Dart 
recalled a cozy little place on Level 
68 North called the House of 
Eighty-two Flavors. They went 
there the following evening. 

They dropped down East shaft, 
crossed to North by the intertower 
beltway, and went down to Level 
68 . 

From the tower’s central shaft, 

helium 



narrow streets fanned out like rays 
and fed traffic to Inner Ring, the 
first circumferential. Sixty-eight 
was a labor quarter with low ceil- 
ings. They parked their tubes in a 
garage and went in on foot. They 
found the feeder street deserted and 
discovered Inner Ring blocked by 
huge inflated bags, one on each 
side. Through a/ gap between the 
bags, people slowly passed into the 
interior eyed by police in blue uni- 
forms. 

Dart pointed to the crowd and 
asked what it was all about. 

Barney said: “That’s a roundup. 
Franco. Remember the riot of a few 
days ago? Media filmed Sidney’s 
jump. They also filmed the riots. 
Now they’re rounding up the par- 
ticipants.” 

“How? How can they possibly 
pick individuals out of this mob?” 

The people of Union all looked 
alike to Dart, especially those on 
lower levels who, deprived of the 
luxury of artisun, had blue-white 
faces. They looked like things you 
might find at home under a rock. 

“They condition the police to 
remember the faces. They sit in 
front of viewing screens for days on 
end. Their recall is also boosted by 
a mnemonic drug.” 

They joined the crowd at the rear 
and shuffled forward as it moved. 
Barney towered above the people, a 
giant in a white robe. Dart saw sev- 
eral people pulled out of the line by 
police. One older man in the green 
jump suit of nutrition tank atten- 
dants protested his innocence with 
vigor. His fat mate came to his aid 
swinging a plastic shopping bag. 
Both were dragged away.

“What’ll happen to them?” 
Barney turned a thumb toward 
the reddish netting of the flexoplast. 

“Surely you’re joking,” Dart 
reacted. “They wouldn’t execute 
them for rioting, would they?” 
Barney saw this as an opening 
for the attack he planned, and so he 
arched his eyebrows, said: “Where 
have you been. Franco? Don’t tell 
me you don’t know about condi- 
tions in Ricardo. Have those young- 
sters cut you out of the cable traf- 
fic?” 

The remark hurt — it really hurt. 
Dart mumbled something. 

Barney persisted. “What is your 
function on this delegation. Franco? 
I’ve assumed all along that you’re 
the Number Two.” 

At that point, to Dart’s relief, a 
policeman noticed them and waved. 
Barney’s white robe meant Very 
Big! 

“Look,” Dart said, ducking the 
question. “They’re pointing.” 

They wormed their way through 
the sluggish crowd and soon were 
past the barrier, walking along 
Inner Ring on the stopped 
movebelt. 

Barney didn’t renew his question. 
It had served its purpose. He al- 
ready knew Dart’s rank. Dart, for 
his part, mumbled to himself. He 
should be Number Two. He con- 
soled himself with the reflection 
that even Bono had no real author- 
ity. He was merely Jonny’s mouth- 
piece, not a plenipotentiary. « 
They walked through a desolate 
neighbiarhood. Broken furniture and 
garbage piled beside the movebelt 
testified to disposal chute clog-ups. 
Many windows were broken in 
buildings to either side. Some of 

40 



the overhead lights were out. Wild, 
loud, bold-eyed children played in 
the streets despite the advanced) 
hour. 

As they walked. Dart began to 
speak about the House of Eighty- 
two Flavors Charming atmo- 
sphere. .eccentric chef. 

. .memorable dishes. The shab- 
by neighborhood compelled him 
to justify his choice. 

The place w^s disappointing. A 
smell of burned grease hung about 
little tables covered with an oily, 
checkered material. Little candles 
burned in colored glass. Slick gang- 
sters in jump suits lounged idly in 
the back. How memory deceives! 

To Dart’s relief Barney didn’t 
seem to mind. He said he rather 
liked the place. In the filtered light 
of the candle, his face seemed 
amused. He joked about Dart’s ad- 
venturous past. Dart was a deep 
one, he said. Sly but deep. When 
the girl came, Barney ordered a bot- 
tle of wine. 

After the second bottle had been 
drained and food was on the way, 
Barney looked up at Dart’s flushed 
face. Time to get down to business. 
He had a date with French for the 
next evening, and he meant to give 
French some advance intelligence 
about Ecofreak’s demands. Tack’s 
inexperienced Activists had no idea 
how you worked a Helium round. 

Now the time had come to pluck 
the vail old cock’s dry feathers. To 
hear him tell it, Dart had been the 
terror of Union, the savior of the 
tribe. 

“Ah, yes,” Barney sighed. 
“Those were times. But now- 
adays. Tell me. Franco, how do 
you assess these brash new kids?” 

GALAXY 




Dart glowed with wine and 
niemories. “With a bit of wise and 
seasoned advice, they’ll do all 
right,’’ he winked. 

“But will they listen?’’ 

“It takes a bit of skill and diplo- 
macy,” Dark admitted. “Finesse, 
my dear Andros, finesse.” 

“I’m pleased to hear you say 
that. Franco. They need a man like 
you. Desperately. Your role is ex- 
tremely important. You provide that 
link between experience and energet- 
ic youth. It’s a very responsible 
and subtle role. I don’t envy you the 
job. We niust work hard to save the 
tribe from reckless foolishness. 
With you in the inner circle, I’m 
not so worried about develop- 
ments.” 

Dart compressed a smile into a 
pleased smirk. If Bono would ap- 
preciate his role as much as Barney 
did. 

Barney continued: “I suppose 
that you’ve approved the general 
negotiating plan. I’d feel better if 
you had. I realize that my own pos- 
ition is somewhat ambiguous, what 
with my strong ties to the Accom- 
modationists. But Tack hasn’t re- 
moved me, so I expect that my loy- 
alty is not in question — and I’d like 
to help. It’s unfortunate that Bono 
is having such a hard Adjustment. 
Time is wasting. By now we 
should’ve had one or two informal 
chats with the fellows from BTA. 
They must have some early warning 
as a matter of courtesy, at least 
about the hostage question. I’m sure 
you did that sort of thing when you 
were first secretary here. In short. 
Franco, I thought it best to sit down 
with the only man in charge who’s 
on his feet rather than in a tub — ’ ’

and at these words Barney grinned 
“ — and see what orders you may 
have for me.” 

Dart drew himself up in his 
chair. ‘‘As a matter of fact, I 
agreed to this delightful dinner 
because I had the same intentions. 
I did approve the strategy — re- 
luctantly, Andros, very reluctant- 
ly. I meant to discuss the matter with 
you. Privately, of course. .” 

‘‘Of course.” 

‘‘Chief Bono and I are not 
entirely. ...” 

‘‘I understand,” Barney hastened 
to say. ‘‘Old diplomats like us 
know the value of discretion.” 
‘‘The real work is done like 
this,” Dart persisted, ‘‘privately.” 
‘‘My view to a fault.” 

‘‘Well, Andros, Tack is deter- 
mined to obtain the silcoplast parts, 
you know.” Dart watch Barney’s 
face, but Barney gave no reaction. 

‘‘The silcoplast parts,” he said 
evenly. 

‘‘And to get sufficient leverage, 
he intends to ask for Sidney as hos- 
tage.” 

‘‘Sidney Unsler as hostage,” the 
ambassador echoed. 

Dart nodded with a gleam in his 
eye. ‘‘Sidney Unsler.” 

He thought: Barney must be sur- 
prised, though he doesn’t show it. 

Dart went on: ‘‘In addition, that 
is to say to add more leverage yet, 
he’ll ask for eight hundred thousand 
tons of plastosteel.” 

‘‘Ten times the usual demand,” 
Barney said without intonation. 
‘‘He must want the silcoplast parts 
very much. What are they? Zip- 
pers? Buttons? Hairpins?” 

Dart heard the sarcasm. Once 
more his eyes lit up. ‘‘There are 

42 



some things so secret only the in- 
nermost circle is privy to the infor- 
mation. But I can give you a hint, 
ambassador. There’s been a break- 
through!” 

Barney extracted a small coin 
purse. The cheap article was made 
of sil. Barney squeezed the flat 
round object. A slit in its top 
opened like a mouth. He repeated 
the motion once or twice more. 
Then he put the purse away. 

He said: ‘‘Would this have to do 
something with the Kaysee labs you 
Activists have been funding all 
these years?” 

‘‘I am silent,” Dart pronounced, 
but his eyes gleamed. 

“Why?” Barney probed. “Why 
do we ask Union to give us SP? 
Maoling is a major producer, and 
so is Peacefreak. Why don’t we get 
it from them?” 

Dart raised his eyebrows. He was 
enjoying this. “Welded SP? Does 
Maoling have the clean rooms? 
Does Peacefreak have molecular 
micro-welders?” 

Barney stared into the candle and 
thought about it. Silcoplast was a 
common synthetic derived from 
silicon, cheap to produce, reason- 
ably gravitron resistant, and much 
more durable than the hydrocarbon 
plastics it had replaced. What else? 
Then suddenly he thought he had it 
and, reflecting upon it, he knew he 
had it. Sil was also a laboratory 
curiosity. Low level energies trans- 
mitted through the stuff generated a 
curious field that inhibited all types 
of nuclear core reactions. But the 
inhibiting oscillations were 
random — had to do something with 
the crystalline structure of the 
silicon-carbon. Sometimes it 



GALAXY 




worked, sometimes it didn’t. Bar- 
ney decided to test Dart. The little 
man revealed his every emotion. 

“You’ve learned to control sil- 
oscillations. In effect you’ve got 
a. .a bomb inhibitor.” 

“I am silent,” Dart replied, but 
his eyes flickered. 

“Perhaps you’re free to tell me 
this: Why don’t we build our own 
clean rooms, our own molecular 
welders?” 

“That would take years. Jonny 
has little patience. He wants to act 
now.” 

Barney nodded. 

A lardy woman brought their 
food, a circular tray with seven 
dabs of tankmush, each with a 
unique flavor. In the middle of the tray 
lay limp sticks of simubread. The 
idea was to scoop the mush with 
the bread. 

Barney let the silence build while 
he fell to. In Hinterland the old 
men read the Crestmore bible again, 
fingers on that passage about the 
bastions of the whore. Like a 
malignant virus the Activists had 
lain dormant until this time. Now 
they had the argument that no one 
could refute. “We have it in our 
power to topple the structures. The 
Abomination shall be humbled. We 
shall break the back of the Tech- 
nology Beast. No more threats, 
people of Hinterland. Their missiles 
shall never strike again. In the heart 
of every town we shall build a 
generator, and their bombs will fall 
like rocks but won’t explode.” The 
little people didn’t know this, need- 
less to say. But the members of the 
tribal council must have heard 
Tack’s eloquence and voted to send 
Pranklin, Denton, Ruff and the 

helium 



others back to their wells and, 
ranches, dispossessed — the noble 
cause of Accommodation dead, dis- 
placed by the pointy-eyed wrath of 
the Crestmore zealots. The assess- 
ment made sense. It must have been 
thus. 

Chewing, Barney looked up. He 
took a sip of wine, swallowed, and 
said: “The strategy stinks. And it’s 
juvenile. Union will smell a rat. 
Tack has lost h'is marbles. All you 
Activists are crazy. Here’s what’ll 
happen. Franco. Proctor will run to 
Harvanth of Defense, and the two 
of them together will see the Un- 
ifier. Unsler will have to pay atten- 
tion to this one. He’ll give Proctor 
permission to attack — selectively, of 
course. They won’t stop until all of 
our production capacity is 
destroyed — all but the essential re- 
fineries, of course. They won’t 
touch the Helium. The irony of 
it. Union will destroy our 
technology. This is the Helium War 
of 1011 all over again. How many 
of these components does Tack 
want, by the way?” 

Dart wiggled uneasily. “I can’t 
tell you that.” 

Barney laughed. “Franco, don’t 
be silly. You must. You’ve already 
blabbered out too much. We’re 
conspirators, you and I. You must 
confide in me.” 

Dart protested: “I didn’t tell you 
anything of importance.” 

Barney cocked his head and 
smiled. “Of course you did. You 
gave me the hostage demand 
— another really jejune notion. I 
suppose Tack thinks that Union will 
give up the parts if we relent on the 
hostage question. Where have you 
people been these last few decades. 

43 




This is no way to negotiate! You 
should have asked for micro- 
welders, not for the components. 
Insane! Well, how many?” 

Dart stared glumly. 

“Franco, out with it. If you play 
games with me, I swear I’ll cable 
Tack and expose your blabber- 
mouth.” 

“Fifty thousand.” 

“So many? Why. .that’s almost 
one for each tribal settlement. Why 
the sudden concern for other 
tribes?” 

Dart stared ahead unhappily. He 
didn’t touch his food. 

“Explain it to me. Franco.” 
“There’s an alliance.” 

“What?!” 

“Jonny has formed a tribal al- 
liance. It’s called the Counter- 
union.” 

“Sooooo! Well, that explains a 
few things too. Far too many am- 
bassadorial changes lately. Hmmm. 
Jonny has ambitions, then. He 
wants to bring all of Hinterland 
under his protective umbrella. 
But eat. Franco; try this peppery 
stuff here. Not bad.” 

“I’m not hungry,” Dart said. 
Then, after a moment: “What’ll 
you do, Andros.” 

“I’m more discrete than you. 
Franco. I’m not going to tell you. 
But, as the saying goes, a hint is 
permitted. I expect to look out for 
the Accommodationist cause.” 

THE HARVEY HARE 

In the alternating cycles between 
dumb pain and almost disembodied 
vision, Bono had lost track of the 
passage of time. 

44 



Somewhere in that murky chunk 
of duration, a physician had instal- 
led a needle into his arm. Sugar 
flowed into his body through the 
hose that linked the needle to a bot- 
tle hung on high. He wore a strange 
pair of rubber shorts from which his 
wastes were pumped out. In lucid 
moments he could hear the pump 
cut in and out at intervals. The rest 
of him, up to the neck, was sub- 
merged in jelly. It trembled with his 
every breath and exhalation. 

Some chemical in the sugar or 
the gel interfered with his brain 
chemistry. Time and time again he 
dozed off to relive with minute var- 
iations a single experience — his last 
day on his father’s ranch on the 
Plain of Baez, a vast expanse of 
mutagrass steppe closed off in the 
distance by the jagged blue line of 
the Sierra Blanca. 

He hunted the giant Harvey hare, 
one of many curiosities created by 
radiation’s disorderly invasion of 
the chromosomal world. He was 
again a half-naked fifteen-year-old 
armed with a crossbow, stealthily 
stalking through shoulder-high 
mutagrass toward the grazing beast. 
The Harvey raised its head from 
time to time, ears erect, listening. 
Then the head went down again and 
the hare fed invisibly on young 
mutagrass sprouts that issued green 
in spring and autumn. When the 
Harvey ate, Mycal crept forward, 
the wind in his face. When Harvey 
listened, he crouched. Cricks 
chirped harshly on all sides, and a 
flock of carries, sensing a feast, 
glided in a far away circle against 
the sky. 

Kilometers away a large transport 
copter landed near the ranch house 

GALAXY 




and a group of boys clambered out. 
Xhey stood about in a half circle 
and threw rocks at a scarecrow 
while the pilot went inside. The 
copter belonged to the Activist 
Academy at Wellhead, and it had 
come to fetch Mycal for his first 
term. It meant the end of his care- 
free days. 

Men on horseback soon rode off 
to find the youngster. 

Oblivious of all this, Mycal crept 
forward. Fifty meters from the beast 
he picked up the musk-scent of a 
female. He paused and checked his 
dark, oily bow, the cranked-back 
wire, the blunt bolt. Then in the 
high tones of a boy whose voice 
had not yet changed, he called: 
“Har-vey! Har-vey!” 

The she-hare rose, a large white 
apparition. She sailed from Mycal 
in the first zig of a zigzag course. 
He had anticipated the intial direc- 
tion. When the hare zagged, they 
were both heading for the same spot 
like lines of a triangle on a collision 
course. 

The hare was faster than the boy 
and reached the magic spot where 
obscure instinct made all Harveys 
stop for the cloying counterattack. 
The Harvey turned and stopped. 
Her red eyes were sad with an un- 
speakable sadness. Her ears hung 
down accentuating the pitiful look. 
Her paws were bent in the manner 
of a begging dog. 

Then the telepathic pulse hit 
Mycal with full force. 

He had only a second to react. 

He felt a sensation of pity, love, 
and concern for the hare. The beast 
appeared to him not as it was — a 
white giant, a half ton of muscle 
and sinew wrapped in a fluffy pelt 

helium 



that brought three hundred suds in 
Merillo. Harvey seemed a tiny, 
sweet, and utterly helpless baby 
rabbit, a lost little thing. Mycal’s 
eyes watered with affection. 

Tribesmen thought that the Har- 
vey hunt strengthened the character. 
Mycal had killed seven hares in the 
course of growing up. He knew 
how to choke down the pity. When 
the beast zigged again, he let the 
bolt fly. She gave an agonized 
shriek and fell out of sight into the 
grass. 

Her shrieks continued, and he 
went after her, hard and pitiless in- 
side. She lay on her back and 
spasmed, pink nostrils gushing 
blood, red eyes terrified. He felt the 
terror as if it were his own. 
Nevertheless, he knelt beside the 
beast and slit her throat with a 
wide-bladed knife. 

She was his eighth hare. 

Bono relived the experience time 
and time again. The dream changed 
shape. Sometimes he called and 
there was no Harvey. Sometimes he 
shot her and she fell dead at his 
feet. Sometimes he missed. Yet 
again he joined in her pity and em- 
braced the hare with a rush of emo- 
tion, and the two of them cried in 
each other’s arms like people. 

Awakening with a shudder, he 
felt the inrush of discomfort. The 
pressure descended on him. His 
breath grew heavy and he began to 
gasp for air. He could swear that a 
chemical interfered with his mem- 
ory. 

Bono had devised a method to 
escape the trauma. He concentrated 
on his heart beat, on his breathing. 
He took one breath at a time. 
In. .out. .in. .out. .in. .out. 

45 




Silvery, swaying, there was the 
Plain of Baez. In the distance stood 
the Sierra Blanca. Mycal stalked 
through the shoulder-high grass. 
The Harvey looked up, ears tall and 
trembling. 



CARELESS IN THE PIT 

French met Barney for dinner in 
The Mutant, a fashionable but dis- 
crete up-level eating place in West 
Tower. French chose roast veal 
with autumn potatoes; Barney or- 
dered cricklegs in wine sauce. Not 
everyone in Union’s structures ate 
flavored tankmush. The very rich 
and very poor had access to real 
food as well. French picked up the 
ninety-sud tab; it was a bargain 
considering the information he had 
gained. 

They parted in the tubepark ad- 
joining the restaurant. French found 
his official BTA tube, a red-white 
striped affair. He headed out to find 
Proctor. A flame had left the res- 
taurant some time before and, spot- 
ting French’s tube in the lot, had 
hidden in the shadows. Now he fol- 
lowed French at a distance. In his 
excitement, French didn’t notice the 
surreptitious pursuit. 

The time was ten forty-five at 
night or fifteen minutes after the 
scheduled start of the late-night 
jumpball game. Tonight Proctor had 
the Leader Box and French made 
for Central’s collosseum to catch 
Proctor with the news. 

When he arrived he noticed at 
once that Proctor hadn’t made his 
appearance yet. The people roared 
with unhappiness and stamped on 
the thin plastosteel floor so that the 

46 



collosseum trembled. A band 
played on the field below, bulj 
crowd noise almost completely ob- 
literated the sound. 

The Leader Box was on the 
upper level, accessible by the wide 
corridor that went up around the 
place in a spiral. French stopped 
along the way and chose one of a 
bank of empty telbooths. He closed 
the door to dampen the noise, 
dialed Fred Clemmens at his 
cubohome. Clemmens was director 
of the technical division, one of 
three operations under French in the 
Office of Intelligence. 

The man appeared in the tiny 
screen, older and balding. A towel 
hung around his neck. 

French said: “Fred, what do you 
know about silcoplast?’’ 

Clemmens raised his eyebrows. 
French went on, a little amused. 
“Ever hear of a silcoplast wave 
modulator used in a telcom net?’’ 
Clemmens said: “Riv, what is 
this? Some kind of practical joke?’’ 
“I am serious, my friend. Eco- 
freak will ask us for fifty thousand 
silcoplast devices or components or 
switches or whatnot; they claim 
they need them for a communica- 
tions system. I searched my brain, 
Fred, but somehow the demand 
didn’t make sense.’’ 

Clemmens shook his head 
slowly. “It doesn’t; not on the face 
of it. Are you worried?” 

“Aren’t you?” 

Clemmens made a face., 
“Frankly, Riv, you’ve made me in-: 
terrupt my vibromassage, so. .” 
“Do you have contacts in the SP 
industry?” ; 

“Some, yes.” ■ 

“Well, Fred, 1 want you to get 

galaxy: 




on the tel and have the best sil- 
chemists in here by tomorrow morn- 
ing” 

Clemmens said: “You are 

worried. You sure? The SP centers 
are mostly in Husten, Norlens, and 
Laystruc. Should I. 

“Yes. Fly them in overnight. I 
think this is a big one.” 

French signed off and went on 
his way. 

Through vaulted doors spaced at 
regular intervals, he could oversee 
the colorful crowd and the green 
field below. The crowd was in an 
angry, ugly mood. Hate vibrations 
filled the air. Roused structure 
crowds were dangerous, especially 
sporting crowds. The leader had 
made them wait for more than half 
an hour. Clearly people didn’t know 
that they waited for Proctor. 

French walked between two 
openings, bare, scuffed wall on 
either side, when the noise suddenly 
intensified, died down. He hurried 
forward. Even before he reached 
the next door, he heard the 
announcer’s magnified voice. 

“Here he is, jumpball fans. The 
games are on. Reston Proctor, the 
Chief Negotiator. ’ ’ 

At the mention of the name, the 
crowd fell silent. It held its breath. 
Then a wild cheering started and 
grew in intensity. 

French had reached the door and 
stopped to watch. 

Light from the floods glared off 
the bullet-proof, chem-proof glass 
of the Leader Box. Proctor was not 
visible inside, and the crowd 
Wanted to see him. It took up a 
chant. “Proc-tor, Proc-tor, Proc- 
tor.” 

Then French saw movement in 

helium 



the box — a blue robe flashed. 
Cheering and whistling much more 
intense than before displaced the 
chanting. It lasted a long time but, 
finally, slowly, it died out. 

French walked on, thinking about 
Proctor’s popularity. Media had is- 
sued two books in as many years 
glorifying Proctor. Boss and BTA In 
Action. For three years now a vis- 
ishow ran on Saturday nights called 
The Hunt. It had an ‘organization’ 
much like the BTA, an ‘old man’ 
who resembled Proctor, a black 
security chief — black like Darby 
Dickens. Proctor’s engineered popu- 
larity was all part of the Secret 
Agenda. Hondo Weinberger, one of 
the Media Bigs, often lunched with 
Proctor in BTA’s executive dining 
room. He was not the only one. 

It was a measure of Unsler’s de- 
crepitude that he tolerated the obvi- 
ous self-promotion of one of his 
agency heads. .and a measure of 
Sidney’s stupidity that he appeared 
not to notice. Or perhaps Sidney 
had noticed — hence the recent har- 
rassement. 

Outside the Leader Box stood 
one of Dickens’ men. 

“Mr. French, I’ll have to search 
you.” 

“Me, Harlow? For God’s sake, 
surely you know meV’ 

“Sorry, sir. New orders from 
Dickens. Everybody must be 
searched. No exceptions. It’s the 
flames sir.” 

“More trouble?” 

“Not so far this week, Mr. 
French, but we’re on a general se- 
curity alert.” 

French handed over a pistol he’d 
checked out of the security shop 
some days ago. He’d considered 

47 




that precaution enough against the 
flames. 

He said: “Here. Now you can be 
sure I won’t shoot the Negotiator.” 

“Yes, sir. Go right on in.” 

French frowned as he walked 
down the aisle of the Leader Box, 
his eyes on the players. Some 
floated in the air, maneuvering with 
boot and elbow jets. Others stood 
on the ground in patterns of defense 
and attack. French scorned the 
game. He belonged to the die-hard 
set that resented the game’s de- 
bauchery by the addition of 
Fulbright’s gravitron webbing. The 
classic collision of forces had be- 
come an awkward aerial ballet. 

Proctor sat up front alone, ab- 
sorbed in documents from a brief- 
case. French pulled up his robe, sat 
down, and gave his report. Barney 
did not think that the Activists 
would last long. He had hinted 
pointedly that Ecofreak should look 
out for some electronic components 
ostensibly meant for a telcom sys- 
tem across four radiation belts 
— Barney hadn’t said anything spe- 
cifically, but that had come across 
clear as a bell. Sil-components 
welded to copper. Those parts 
would play a key role in the negoti- 
ations, French said. Then he re- 
ported on the predicted plastosteel 
levy and the hostage demand. 

Down below three men in red 
crashed against the tripple-decker 
flywall, zoomed down. Ground 
guards felled them with loud snaps 
of equipment. 

Proctor stared at the groaning 
crowd. 

“Sidney Unsler,” he rumbled. 
“That’s interesting.” 

“It doesn’t make sense,” French 

48 



threw in. “Either they are incredi- 
bly naive negotiators — or else I’m 
missing something. I think it’s a di- 
version, Res, an attempt to make us 
focus on the hostage question. 
They’d rather we don’t think about 
the things they really want. Tech- 
nology. The sil-components. Barney 
almost said as much. You just don’t 
ask for the Underunifier as 
hostage — not in this day and age.” 
“Very interesting,” Proctor 
mused. 

French asked, “What do you 
make of it?” 

Proctor glanced at French, a little 
wary. “You know how I feel about 
those intelligence estimates.” 
“They’re the best we have.” 
“Sure, sure. Still. Rivera, I 
sense trouble. I suspect these ‘Ac- 
tivists’ of yours, and the demand 
for Sidney makes me nervous. Sup- 
pose they insist on the demand, in- 
sist hard enough so that I’m forced 
to take it up with Unsler.” 

“So?” 

“So I take it up with Unsler 
— and suppose Unsler says ‘Yes.’ ” 
French was genuinely puzzled. 
“Why would he do that?” 

“Because he wants Accommoda- 
tion. I can see it now. Sidney in 
Hinterland. Sidney hobnobbs with 
tribal leaders. Sidney forms close 
friendships.” 

“With Activists?” 

“^they’re Activists.” 

French didn’t hide his irritation. 
“Res, they are Activists. I have no 
doubts about it. I’ve been out 
there.” He gestured with an arm. 
“I’ve seen the sour bread.” 

“You’re too brash, Rivera, too 
damned cocksure.” 

For a moment both men were si- 

GALAXY 




lent. Down below whistles shrilled 
and flags dropped from the rafters. 
French broke the silence. 

“The key is in those silco parts. 
Barney’s hint was — hell, it was a 
slap in the face. Hint isn’t the right 
word.’’ 

Proctor shrugged. “Maybe. 
Maybe not. Maybe they want us to 
worry about the technology. Be- 
sides, technology is one of those 
things with Ecofreak. They always 
want some damned oddity. The last 
time it was laser drilles — but noth- 
ing happened.’’ 

French said; “I’m suspicious.’’ 

“You’re always suspicious,’’ 
Proctor countered. “You’ve got a 
fetish about technology. You were 
suspicious in ’51, but nothing hap- 
pened, like I said. Those people are 
like monkeys. They like to play 
with gadgetry. It’s like sex with 
them. Because the Crestmore for- 
bids it — therefore it has appeal.’’ 
Silence. “Sidney Unsler. That may 
be a brilliant ploy.’’ He thought 
about it for another second. “At 
any rate, we must wait for more de- 
tails. How is the Helium situa- 
tion?’’ 

“Flow is back by thirty 
percent — the usual thing. All the 
structures are holding. Four or five 
days inventory, roughly.” 

“Air liquefaction?” 

“The stand-by units are all 
operating and they compensate for 
the shortfall. But it’s the usual 
problem. We’re having one hellish 
energy drain. Just not enough fu- 
sion capacity for everything 
— gravitron, services, and air li- 
quefaction.” 

Proctor nodded. “High time we 
start the talks. The ball’s tomorrow, 

helium 



and the first session the day after 
that. By the way, I did wangle an 
invitation for Miri. It was like 
pulling teeth, but she’s invited.” 

French smiled. “Thanks,” he 
said. “Miri has been after me for 
months. Though search me why 
anybody would want to go to a Top 
Level dance.” 

“Women,” Proctor said in the 
tone of a confirmed bachelor who 
has long ago stopped trying to un- 
derstand the mystery. 

They talked for a while longer 
about concurrent talks with Maoling 
and toxic metals in a shipment of 
lettuce delivered recently. French 
noted down some assignments and 
finally left. 

He headed south by the inter- 
tower beltway. South Tower was a 
pattern of random lights ahead. He 
lived with Miri on Level 118. He 
wondered if she still waited up for 
him. He longed for her company. 

He thought: What makes me dis- 
consolate? 

Laser drills, his mind answered 
instantly. 

Yes, laser drills. They sym- 
bolized for French Proctor’s con- 
tempt for all technical matters, his 
preoccupation with politics and per- 
sonalities at the expense of gut is- 
sues. 

During the last Helium round 
Ecofreak had demanded and gotten 
five hundred laser drills despite the 
tribe’s weak rationale. They’d 
claimed to need them for dental 
work, which was ridiculous. French 
had protested, had been overruled. 
Later he’d personally gone deep 
into Hinterland to find out how 
Ecofreak had really used the drills. 
The track had led to a research 

49 




center under maximum security out- 
side Kaysee in Mokan Territory. 
French had returned more suspi- 
cious than ever, but Proctor had sim- 
ply shrugged off the report. The 
pieces of the puzzle locked nicely. 
The Tacks came from the Kaysee 
region. Could those lasers have 
something to do with Jonny’s rise 
to power? Could the sil-parts be 
another link in a technological 
chain? 

He entered South shaft and, bot- 
tom jets blazing, began the steep 
ascent. Podlike elevators clung to 
the walls. 'Hundreds of slide bars 
glistened darkly between the 
elevator grooves. The chasm was 
empty, the hour late. 

Near Level 80 a group of white- 
clad men in tubes shot out of a 
feeder nearly colliding with French. 
The timing of their entry convinced 
him it was no accident. Among the 
men were several prominent flames, 
including Clafto Meyer, the dark, 
swarthy plastosteel heir Sidney now 
favored as his first deputy. 

“Watch were you’re going, 
pig!” 

“Fratres, that’s no ordinary pig. 
That’s a BTA pig, a superpig.’’ 

“We don’t like BTA pigs, do 
we, amicH Let’s teach this guy how 
to drive a tube.” 

French assessed the situation 
coolly. His standard issue vehicle 
couldn’t outrun the expensive jobs 
these boys had. He had retrieved 
his pistol from Harlow, but the 
goons must also be armed. Stare 
them down? Talk them out of it? 
French had cold memories of many 
bloody Branco confrontations, many 
close calls in Hinterland. Old in- 
stincts stirred. His fatigue fled 

50 



under a rush of adrenaline. 

The flames had begun to ma- 
neuver, forming a circle about him, 
even as they all rose in the shaft at 
maximum speed. 

French guessed their intention. 
They would try to upend his tube, 
to make it tumble around and 
around until the centri-forces grew 
so great that he’d be flung free. 

One of the men lunged, sidejets 
ablaze. French saw the mindless 
grin of a youngster. The feint didn’t 
deceive him. He turned quickly and 
saw two others almost upon him. 
He chopped out with the edge of 
his hand. A man reeled back, 
coughing. He punched the other and 
shoved his tube aside. French saw 
two others dart forward from the 
comer of his eyes. 

He couldn’t win. This was their 
game. He did the only thing he 
could do. 

With a flick of his thumbs, he 
cut out jets and gravitron and over- 
rode safety with his knees. His tube 
dropped from the circle of his pur- 
suers like a rock. 

French had practiced this ma- 
nuever years ago in training. The 
Death Drop. But this time there was 
no flexonet to catch him if he 
failed. An endless chasm yawned 
below. His fall accellerated, and his 
tube began to tumble slowly as it 
fell. French held on with all his 
might. He stared rigidly ahead. His 
innards liquefied. Physical terror 
clutched him. Forces tugged and 
wrenched. His knuckles grew white 
as he gripped the rail. His knees 
went numb against the tube. 

The shaft turned helter skelter, 
now up, now down, a wheeling 
broken telescope of light. On one of 

GALAXY 




the turns he saw the flames in hot 
pursuit. But they came slowly, with 
jet power. 

His mind wheeled. His brain 
lagged behind events. His thoughts 
flashed. Flames, BTA, Proctor, 
Miri, Helium. He had no time to re- 
flect, but his body and mind were 
active. His eyes measured the 
height and counted levels. Around 
Level 20 he cut in the gravitron. 
Immediately his body grew heavy, 
his own weight nearly crushed him. 
The tumbling stopped slowly, but 
the inertial forces of his fall over- 
came the gravitron, and he went on 
falling at a sideways tilt. 

At Level 1 he cut in sidejets. 
When the tube had righted, he let 
the bottom jets blaze. Despite these 
actions, his tube crashed on the 
concrete of the Pit and burst apart 
in a shower of sparks. French fell 
free and rolled some distance from 
the impact point before the tube ex- 
ploded. A long flame shot toward 
him and licked his face. 

He rolled from the flame and lay 
where he came to rest. He felt a 
pain in head and shoulder. He 
scrambled up and nearly stumbled 
over his own robe. Black clouds of 
smoke rose from the furiously burn- 
ing tube. 

Above him flames approached. 
He stared up into the chasm for a 
second, an endless tubularity. From 
this perspective it seemed to curve, 
to lean over him. He couldn’t see 
all the way up. The shaft walls 
closed in and came together in a 
point. 

French ran toward a corridor. 

Roused from the dull routine of 
duties in a lighted booth, a pit 
guard waved his arms. BTA forces 

helium 



secured the Pit, but the guard didn’t 
recognize French. He ran past the 
man and into a darkness faintly lit 
by red lights. The guard yelled be- 
hind him. French ripped the purple 
robe from his body as he ran; it im- 
peded his movements. He wore a 
simple grey jump suit underneath. 

French knew Helium like few 
other men. He knew precisely 
where Ecofreak pipelines fed each 
and every Union structure, how the 
gas was liquefied and where, how 
die cold stuff flowed to the drums. 
He knew the layout of the Pit in 
every detail. But his memories went 
even farther back. As a boy he had 
explored the deep, dark catacombs 
below the Pit, the tunnels and bun- 
kers of ancient Eastcoast on whose 
site Ricardo had been built. He 
knew where he was. He had several 
avenues of escape — sideways, up, 
or down. He stopped to orient him- 
self. 

That luminous exit sign up ahead 
would lead into one of the drum 
rooms and from there he could 
make his way into the interior of 
the structure. 

He ran toward the sign freeing 
his pistol as he ran. He heard voic- 
es and the sounds of boots on con- 
crete. 

He ducked into the opening and 
fired at movement behind him. He 
meant to do no harm, merely to 
show that he was armed and 
dangerous. In the narrow confines 
of the corridor, the sound of the 
blast was deafening and made his 
ears ring. 

He ran through an instrument 
room, face lit up for a second by 
green, red, and yellow lights from a 
panel. And from there, through a 

51 




door, beneath low-slung piping, he 
entered a gigantic hall so filled with 
the hum of vibrations that he 
couldn’t hear his own feet hit the 
ground when he cleared some low 
steps. 

Pain stabbed up his leg. He hob- 
bled forward and ducked behind a 
huge, grey, loaf-shaped machine to 
catch his breath, massage the foot. 

Hall A. Six giant generators 
stood in a line. Beneath the painted, 
yellow, concrete floor on which he 
cowered lay tanks of liquid Helium. 
Dmms turned half submerged in the 
liquid. From the generator casings 
gargantuan strands of cable, each 
fiber as thick as a man, carried the 
pulse into a vaulted ceiling and, 
through the ceiling, to the plasto- 
steel framework of the tower. 

He shook his head to clear the 
pain, blinked, and peeked past the 
grey-painted metal of the drum to- 
ward the door through which he’d 
come, toward the stairs he had de- 
scended. 

His foot still hurt. He didn’t dare 
attempt the run until he had assured 
himself that his pursuers had given 
up the chase. Just in case, he took 
aim with the pistol. He aimed it at 
the door. His hand shook so that he 
had to steady it with his left. When 
the door opened a crack and then 
all the way; when he saw a white- 
robed figure slipping through; he 
pulled the trigger without thinking. 
The shape fell forward and rolled 
down the stairs. 

French blasted away until the 
door closed. 

In the fantastic hum of the hall, 
he hadn’t heard the sound of his 
own shots. 

He waited a moment longer. The 



man he’d shot lay sideways on the 
stairs. Blood spread a large circle of 
red on his chest. 

French stared at the dead flame. 
Now I’ve done it. Now they have a 
casualty! 

He was angry with himself, 
angry that he hadn’t had sense 
enough to think before he’d shot. 
He could have eluded these goons. 
The consequences of his action 
came to him now. The death of a 
flame meant big trouble for BTA. 
A blood-bath could follow 
this. .Goddamned! 

He gathered himself from the 
floor and limped past other grav- 
drums. He came into another hall 
where expanders liquefied Helium 
and stopped to decide on his 
course. The dead man would serve 
as a warning. No need to find one 
of the hidden passages to the 
catacombs. He’d make his way to a 
small elevator not far from here. 
The BTA master key would operate 
it. 

He reached the lift without mis- 
hap. The elevator came, summoned 
with a button. He walked into the 
narrow box, punched 118. 

When the register showed Level 
60, French finally relaxed. He had 
been leaning against the wall. Now 
he let himself slide down to the 
floor. The pistol still hung from his 
fingers. Flames from the exploding 
tube had blackened his hand. 
Singed hairs curled at the ends. For 
a long moment French stared at the 
hairs as if they were a matter of the 
greatest interest. Then he broke his 
gaze. 

He realized that he was very 
shaken. Energy had drained from 
his legs, arms, hands. 



52 



GALAXY 




It took him a long time to put the 
pistol into the case. 

He looked at his watch. The ex- 
quisite device, a gift of Mini’s, had 
been shattered. The fine pieces of 
the micromosaic had been dis- 
lodged. The digits had stopped at 
11:59. 



MIRI 



Miri French spent her evening at 
a meeting of her coven on Level 
120. Most of the session had been 
devoted to a test of mantuition, the 
art of reading character from the 
aural energies that leave the human 
body by the extremeties. 

All ad-adepts had gathered in a 
small room. Two women and two 
men hired to help in the procedure 
had waited behind curtains in a dark 
room. Groping in the darkness that 
prevented the acquisition of visual 
cues, Miri had followed others to 
shake hands with the strangers. 
Then she retired to a cubicle next 
door to write down what she had 
learned from those brief touches. 

Afterwards the coven elder 
sought out Miri over tea. 

She said: “Miri, your analysis 
was almost perfect. You’re growing 
stronger in the arts. Soon you’ll ad- 
vance the final step. Frankly, that 
pleases me very much — because 
you’re marked.’’ 

Miri reached up involuntarily and 
touched a birthmark on her cheek. 
From time to time the elders men- 
tioned that peculiarity of hers. Each 
time Miri felt a vague uneasiness 
combined with an inner pulsation as 
if a suppressed memory were trying 

HELIUM 



to surface. But the memory 
bounced up against a barrier of 
some sort. 

To her the birthmark was simply 
a blemish. To the elders it meant 
something else. For months at a 
time they allowed her to forget that 
she wore ‘Madonna’s Mark.’ But 
then, out of the blue, came another 
cool reminder. Miri found this 
maddening. The mark meant that 
she ‘had a role in history.’ Beyond 
that no one would tell her anything. 

She looked up at the coven elder, 
a fortyish woman whose face was 
smooth as marble from the spiritual 
abrasions of meditation. 

She said: “Mother, I may be 
marked, but I’m still childless. In 
my group I’m the only one who 
hasn’t passed through Aat experi- 
ence. I can’t become a full adept 
until I have conceived. Do you 
think Frenchy is sterile?” 

Miri kept her voice under 
control — the least of accomplish- 
ments for a member of the Cult. 
Even her eyes were steady. But the 
question stirred anxieties that ad- 
adepts were supposed to have put 
behind them. She hoped with un- 
seemly eagerness that the Lady 
wouldn’t test her to the utmost 
— that her Frenchy would be spared 
the grav-sterility that afflicted so 
many. Could she, a member of 
Madonna’s cosmic body, be mated 
to a crippled male? 

The elder smiled faintly. She 
reached over and patted Miri’s arm. 
“You’ll conceive, Miri. The mark 
assures it. Just don’t forget to prac- 
tice vision. Form a strong vision of 
maternity — but what am I telling 
you. You know all that. Tell me, 
are you bothered by something?” 



53 




“No, mother. .yes, mother, I 
sense — I have an odd intuition. 
Something is wrong. I think it has 
to do with Frenchy.” 

“Let me feel your hand.” 

Miri laid her hand into the elder’s 
who, in turn, eyes slightly nar- 
rowed, sampled Miri’s mood. 

The elder said after a moment: 
“A party, a dance. Some sort of 
great event. You’re worried about 
some future event.” 

Miri laughed. “You’re right. I’m 
anxious about an invitation to a Top 
Level ball. The ball’s tomorrow, 
but I still don’t know whether I’m 
going — and I want to very much.” 
“Anxiety is unnecessary. Now 
that you’re an ad-adept, you could 
consult the Sybilline books — and 
you’ll know whether you’re going 
or not.” 

Miri looked down at her cup. 
“It’s a trifle, really. And we’re not 
supposed to trifle with the oracle.” 
The elder rose. “Of course, not, 
child, but we can make an occa- 
sional exception. Have you con- 
sulted the oracle about concep- 
tion?” 

Miri shook her head. 

“There, now. That’s not a tri- 
fling matter. You should trust 
yourself — and the Lady. Above all, 
Miri, avoid anxiety, practice vision. 
Practice, practice, practice. Until 
next week, then.” 

Saying this, the elder nodded and 
went her way. 

Miri’s tea had been laced with 
Millusion, and soon the effect of 
the drug manifested itself in a bell- 
like ringing in the head. She moved 
toward the assembly hall whispering 
with others. They settled on cush- 
ions on the floor. The lights 

54 



dimmed and visions appeared on the 
large curving screen. 

Miri caught her breath as Earth 
appeared, a green-white magnifi- 
cence, turning slowly against a vel- 
vet darkness. She heard music. The 
picture faded and others came in 
succession, brilliant visions of the 
world as it had been in ancient 
times, a riot of color and a shimmer 
of light, an exotic profusion of 
biological life, of jungles, prairies, 
animal herds, bird flocks, fish 
schools, and things that creeped and 
crawled. The proud, beaked head of 
an eagle, the moist nostrils of a 
hippo, the shadowy whisk of a deer 
tail, the rush of wind in tree tops, 
the radiance of a screen of fish in 
coral, the glistening sweat on the 
bodies of men rowing a log canoe, 
the lumbering of a polar bear, a 
drop of water on a leaf. 

The beauty of it brought tears to 
her eyes. Millusion enhanced her 
senses, enabled her to become the 
marvelously varied life shown on 
these secret, ancient tapes. She’d 
seen it all before a hundred times, 
but ever and again the vision was 
fresh. She sobbed as she watched, 
knowing it wouldn’t last. 

The visions faded, growing 
lighter and lighter. 

Now a throbbing, hissing, pound- 
ing, and drumming overlaid the 
music. The Male had entered the 
world and transformed it before her 
eyes. These also were ancient 
films — of tractors gauging the earth, 
of skylines forming and disappear- 
ing, of machines beating rythmi- 
cally, of smoke, devastations, pen- 
ned beasts, polar bears bleeding, 
whales quartered and melted, 
parched land, poison fumes, sludge 

GALAXY 




lakes, landscape carved into 
geometrical formations by thousands 
of identical dwellings. 

Miri held her breath and screwed 
up her eyes anticipating the blinding 
light and the explosions. They 
came. In their wake came pictures 
of today — of gaping craters, the uni- 
form silver of mutagrass broken 
here and there by trees, the lope of 
Harvey hare, the flight of carries. 
She saw furtive mutant colonies 
hugging the edge of rad-belts, hid- 
ing in caves, burrows, huts, hovels. 
They hopped one-legged, roll- 
walked three-legged, crawled leg- 
less on rump-stumps. Beemen whis- 
tled bonily, tailed crick-eaters 
purred. She saw six children suck milk 
from a woman’s six udders. 
Tribesmen on horses came to raid, 
poking spears into hovels, looking 
for reasonably humanoid shapes. 
Smoke rose from burning huts when 
the men rode away. 

Last came a vision of the struc- 
tures, one after the other, sur- 
rounded by Desolations. They 
flashed by faster and faster as the 
music rose higher and higher — and 
suddenly there was a single flower, 
sharply in focus, against a blurred 
green and a deep-blue sky. 

The picture hovered before her 
eyes for a long time while the 
music hummed in harmony. 

Then it was over, and Miri went 
home. 

Frenchy was still out. Miri de- 
bated with herself, sensing anxiety. 
Then, to keep her hands busy, she 
resumed work on a micromosaic, 
eyes framed by the rubber of her 
microscope, hands busy with wires 
thinner than hair. She worked for a 
while, absorbed by the task. 

helium 



Nevertheless, her feelings of unease 
grew. At last she rose and stepped 
into her meditation nook, eager to 
rid herself of the odd depression. 

Against the wall hung Madonna’s 
shrine. It featured the Cosmic Lady 
on an oval micromosaic of the 
finest quality. The rays of the sun 
formed her hair. The planets were 
her jewelry. She stood wrapped in 
star-spangled night. Next to her, on 
either side, hung other, small 
pictures — trees, shrubs, animals. 
Suspended from the ceiling on fine 
wire and turning slowly with the 
movement of air in the room were 
tiny yellow birds, their wings ex- 
tended. 

Miri pushed a switch on the floor 
next to the prayer rug. 

A low multi-tonal hum began to 
fill the room. It was electronic 
music, a slowly shifting harmonium 
piece whose sound resembled the 
sonorous chant of men. 

She meditated on maternity. The 
act of love unrolled before her eyes. 
Liquids oozed in palpitating mu- 
cous membrane. A sperm, one of 
thousands, squirmed and struggled 
toward the giant egg. The Female 
roundness waited for the tiny Male. 
They met. He clung to her like a 
particle of dust to an orange, but 
then he penetrated through the shea- 
thing and life had been conceived 
again. 

Miri was pregnant and carrying 
child. She imagined the ceremonies 
in the coven when she’d announce 
her pregnancy, but this portion of 
the vision refused to crystallize. In- 
stead she saw herself struggle in a 
fierce, hot, dust-laden wind. 

Miri opened her eyes and tried 
again. But once more there was 

55 




wind and other people obscurely 
visible through the dust. Someone 
walked beside her, holding her 
hand. 

She opened her eyes, frightened. 

Something interfered with her 
meditation, a worry or an intuition. 
Frenchy was in trouble and she 
knew it. 

She uncoiled from her cross- 
legged position, rose, and walked 
out of the room leaving the deep 
hum behind her. 

She passed through her work 
room where the implements of her 
art were laid out on tables and 
through there to a small but com- 
fortable living room drenched in the 
orange blaze of artisun. 

She went out through the front 
door of the cubohome, took the 
elevator down, nodded to the doz- 
ing guard, crossed the lobby, and 
walked out into the brightly lit 
street through a revolving door. 

Frenchy’s work demanded odd, 
long hours. As a rule she didn’t 
worry about him. So why tonight? 
Why did she feel that something 
was wrong? 

She made for central shaft eyeing 
the airspace above the belt; she 
sought signs of Frenchy’s red-white 
tube. 

No one about. Past midnight. A 
strong current of air blew over 
Outer Ring. They renewed the air at 
night and it smelled fresh and salty. 
Ocean spray entered the ventillation 
intakes down below. The colorful 
banners of competing apartments 
waved and beckoned in the air: 
Hyatt House, Union Manor, Gals- 
worthy Square, Denver Acres. 
Through glass portals she could see 
ornate lobbies and sleepy staffs 

56 



lounging in chairs. 

Going out to meet him like this 
made no sense at all, but Miri had 
to do something. She couldn’t stay 
in the cubohome any longer. 

She searched the empty airspace 
below the brilliant overhead lights 
arranged in random, artistic pat- 
terns. 

She was so intent on the heights 
that she missed him. His call made 
her look down. Then she saw him. 
He seemed to limp slightly as he 
approached on the movebelt. His 
robe was gone, his face blackened 
by soot, his long hair in disarray. 
She broke into a run to meet him. 

“Oh, Frenchy,” she cried when 
they collided. “What happened?” 

He said: “Nothing. Nothing, girl. 
But you — what ’re you doing on the 
belts? Don’t you know how danger- 
ous it is?”

THE OPENING BALL 

The ballroom slowly filled with 
people. They stood on the dance 
floor talking and drinking. They sat 
on a kind of peripheral balcony 
supported by pink marble columns. 
Young men and women moved 
about in separate groups to see and 
be seen. 

The grandiose sweep of the 
place, the flash of lights from chan- 
deliers and jewelry, the shimmer of 
robes and gowns, shadowy move- 
ments in endless mirrors against the 
wall below the balcony, the bubble 
in the wine he drank — all this made 
Bono’s head spin. 

Something in his stomach laughed. 

GALAXY 




Forteen harmonious tones rose 
side by side from an electronic 
organ on a platform to Bono’s left. 
Crystalline water-spurts from a 
fountain to his right pulsed in rythm 
with the music. 

He put his glass on a passing 
tray, snatched a full one. 

He turned to Dart. “Wild, isn’t 
it? Oh, wild,’’ he said with an arch- 
ing eye. 

He ogled a group of passing 
girls. The curvature of rumps and 
breasts shone pink beneath oddly 
textured gowns that seemed to let 
the eye penetrate and then again 
not. 

Dark almond eyes glanced with 
provocation at the group in whose 
midst Bono stood — tribesmen in 
simple leather clothing that looked 
drab amidst the fire of diamonds 
and the sheen of silk. 

He took a large swallow from the 
glass. Droplets of wine clung to his 
mustaches. 

He throbbed with happiness. The 
pressure had fled. Morning had 
brought relief. Amidst the foul stink 
of the gel, in the reddish darkness 
of the bathroom, Bono had 
awakened to his old self. He’d 
scraped the stuff from trunk and 
limb, he’d shaken it from his hand. 
Already then a giddy joy had pos- 
sessed him. No, it wasn’t just the 
bubbly wine nor the shine of glass, 
silk, silver, and waxed wood. Life 
beat again inside his skin. He was 
back among the living again, out of 
the realm of painful dreams. 

He slapped Dart on the back with 
a hand a little out of control, hard 
enough to make the wrinkled old- 
ster spill a drop of wine he 
hadn’t touched. 

HELIUM 



Bono cried: “Come on. Franco! 
Cheer up, old man. Why that dark 
look on your puss. Tonight we see 
how structure Bigs live.’’ 

Dart said nothing. 

He meant to tell Mycal to curb 
his guzzling. His foolish, grinning 
face drew the snickering attention 
of the Bigs. His bucolic manner 
clashed with the sophisticated set- 
ting. Crestmore urged moderation 
— and modest shame in the pres- 
ence of lascivious display. 

Dart said none of this, gloomily 
aware that he’d made a hash of 
things. He followed Barney with his 
eyes. The ambassador mingled with 
Bigs. Dart hoped that Barney would 
stay away from Bono. What if 
those two had a heart-to-heart talk? 

Maybe I should confess it all, he 
thought, but then he shrank back 
from the notion, repelled by the reck- 
less madness in Bono’s eyes. 
Quite clearly the chief was out of 
control on this first day of his Ad- 
justment. He was a five -percenter, 
and God only knew what such a 
man would do. 

Across the room Proctor, who 
had been searching for French, 
found him on the edge of the ball- 
room with Miri. The two watched 
the crowd near a pink column. 

“There you are, Rivera,” Proctor 
rumbled. “Hello, Miri.” He took 
her hand. “It’s been some time 
since I’ve seen you.” 

He eyed her opaque, long-sleeved 
gown, the fringed white stole across 
her shoulders, and noted that she 
did not display herself — but despite 
the chaste costume she was seduc- 
tively full. But her femininity didn’t 
reassure Proctor. He always experi- 
enced a kind of discomfort in her 

57 




presence. She resembled a proud, 
black bird with that dark hair, 
beaked nose, and flashing eyes. A 
single golden ring suspended from 
her left earlobe reminded him that 
she was a witch of some sort, 
member of some obscure cult. 

He released her firm, warm hand, 
still vaguely troubled. 

“You don’t mind if I steal your 
husband for a second, do you? We 
have a small crisis on our hands.” 
He smiled momentarily. 

Miri said: “Not at all, Reston. 
And thank you for getting me the 
invitation.” 

She analyzed the feelings con- 
veyed by Proctor’s hand. He gave 
her a sense of concentration, ambi- 
tion, vulgarity, and repressed re- 
sentment. She had a vision of a 
small, fat boy, the butt of 
jokes. .and the words ‘raisin-balls’ 
echoed in her mind. Had that been 
a nickname of his? It seemed in- 
congruous in a man who lived in a 
world of abstractions, his vital 
energies chained to the power lust. 
At the moment Proctor was also 
fearful of something — and yet he 
seethed with suppressed anger. At 
Frenchy? At something else? 

She looked after the stout, short, 
blading Proctor as he led her hus- 
band a few steps away. How little 
of his power the man revealed in 
his externals, she reflected. Despite 
the blue robe and the ceremonial 
white sash that ran from his shoul- 
der to his waist, Proctor looked 
common — a small bureaucrat. 

Proctor stopped with his hand on 
French’s sleeve. His mind lingered 
on Miri, who was one of the 
Schulheitzins, he now recalled, very 
high. Very Big, a family prominent 

58 



in the arts but inconsequential in 
politics. Miri had made an odd 
match, marrying a slum kid, proba- 
bly the expression of artistic eccen- 
tricity. She was a practicing mi- 
cromosaiker. 

Proctor released French’s robe 
and brought his mind back to the 
unpleasant business. 

“I’ve had a call from Blotting- 
ham.” 

French affected surprise. “Blot- 
tingham on Unsler’s staff?’’ he 
asked, thinking: As if the world 
were simply filled with Blotting- 
hams! There's only one that mat- 
ters. 

“Yes,” Proctor said. “But he 
said he was calling in his private 
capacity.” 

“Meaning?” 

“Meaning he was speaking for 
Sidney.” 

French raised his eyebrows. He 
hoped that the blood pounding in 
his neck was not visible. 

“It seems someone from BTA 
killed one of Sidney’s flames last 
night,” Proctor said, eyes sharp. 
“In a gun fight. Have you picked 
up something on that?” 

“No,” French said tonelessly. 
“What else did he say?” 

“He gave me a few not-so- veiled 
threats. Fact is Blottingham was 
furious, and if he weren’t a bit 
afraid of me. .Anyway, they want 
the man handed over, no questions 
asked.” 

“What did you say?’’ French 
asked. 

Proctor snorted. “The obvious. I 
told them I’d find the man and hand 
him over.” 

French was taken aback. “You 
mean it?” 



GALAXY 




“Don’t be absurd,” Proctor said 
with deep scorn in his voice. “I 
protect my own. But we’ve got to 
gain time. Whoever did it shouldn’t 
have . left witnesses. We can’t afford 
open war with Sidney now.” His 
eyes spoke about the Secret 
Agenda. 

French nodded. There’s no help 
for it, he thought. His eyes were on 
the clump of tribesmen and he 
noted absently that Bono seemed 
quite another man from the reserved 
and hostile Activist French had re- 
ceived a week ago. Bono was bent 
double with laughter, he slapped his 
knee in mirth, spilling wine. 
There’s no help for it. I have to tell 
him. 

He took a deep breath and braced 
for the explosion. “Res, the BTA 
man who did the killing was — me.” 

Miri grew restless as the conver- 
sation between Frenchy and Proctor 
went on and on. The nobility had 
begun to clear the dancefloor. Peo- 
ple took up positions along the 
edges of the shiny, waxed floor. 
Eyes looked expectantly toward a 
double portal. 

Miri watched Frenchy’s red face 
and hang-dog expression while 
Proctor spoke angrily with vehe- 
ment, chopping gestures of his fat 
hands. 

A group of men passed by behind 
Miri. They stopped and drew her at- 
tention by a murmured conversa- 
tion, their heads bunched in a knot. 
From time to time they glanced to- 
ward Proctor and French. Then one 
of them drew away from the group 
and came toward her, a young man 
with an olive complexion, glisten- 
ing hair. 

“Excuse me. Miss,” he said. His 

helium 



half-smile was unpleasant some- 
how. “Would you happen to know 
who that man is?” He inclined his 
head toward Proctor. 

It surprised her that anyone might 
have to ask. She said; “Of course. 
That’s Reston Proctor, the Chief 
Negotiator.” 

The man shook his head. “No, 
no,” he said. “The other one, the 
blond one. I think I recognize him 
from a recent encounter.” At the 
words his lips curled oddly. 

“Why, that’s my husband, Riv- 
era French.” 

His eyes bored into her, noticing 
her for the first time. He nodded. 
“Thank you,” he said, nodded 
again. Then he rejoined his group 
and, arms extended, he pushed his 
companions on their way. None 
looked back at Frenchy. 

Miri couldn’t escape a faint 
shudder, but she couldn’t attribute 
the feeling to anything in particular 
and assumed that she had experi- 
enced the man’s aura mingling with 
her own. Whoever the man was, in- 
side he was a bundle of contradic- 
tions. 

Miri shrugged off the feeling and 
turned her attention to the double 
portals, sensing a sudden hush. In a 
second the electronic organ opened 
with a jangled version of the Grand 
Harmony, music calculated to grip 
the emotions as it rose, fell, rose, 
and built up to the grand finale. It 
brought tears to the eyes, but Miri 
resisted the emotion. She had 
learned to scorn this crude, visceral 
adoration of the Male’s organized 
power. 

When the Grand Harmony was 
done, the organ took up a slow 
march, the portals opened, and she 

59 




saw the Unifier in his golden robe, 
a thick black belt around his mid- 
dle. Behind him came the members 
of the family. 

She noticed that Proctor had been 
caught by surprise. He disengaged 
himself from Frenchy and, as the 
Unifier slowly walked toward the 
Ecofreak delegation, he weaved his 
way rapidly in the same direction 
beneath the balcony. He had a part 
in the ceremonies. 

Frenchy came back to her side 
with that look on his face. 

“It’s all right,’’ she whispered. 
She sought his hand and squeezed 
encouragement. Then she turned her 
head back to the ballroom. 

Behind the Unifier marched Re- 
gina, and behind her, three abreast, 
came the rest of the family. 

Like her father, Regina moved 
slowly, one hesitating step after 
another hesitating step, in rythm 
with the slow processional. She 
looked straight ahead with brief 
glances to the side, noticing people 
she knew, nodding to them faintly. 

She noted with pleasure that all 
eyes were on her. 

Her red hair was piled high on 
her head, revealing the swan-like 
sweep of a delicate neck. The 
hairdo was called Medusa 
— hundreds of ringlets seemingly 
random but actually arranged with 
computerized precision. Emerald 
teardrops swung from her ears. Her 
sheer-robe with the coiling snakes, 
all oriented suggestively toward her 
middle, glistened in the light of 
chandeliers. Tiny bells tinkled on 
her neck. Volcano burned in her 
blood and surrounded her with a 
nimbus of seductive scent. 

She glanced to the side again, 

60 



and her eyes encountered Clafto. 
He stood a little back, half in 
shadow, surrounded by several of 
his sparks. She saw anger in his 
eyes and felt a pulse of fear. So far 
site had kept Clafto at bay, but ob- 
viously Clafto still hoped. 

She broke her gaze and looked 
ahead again with a definat lift of 
her chin. Clafto would have to re- 
sign himself to his fate — yes, even if 
Sidney pressed and pressed and 
pressed. She wouldn’t be his tool 
not any more. 

She dismissed both of them from 
mind and thought about the arch- 
angel with a cool sort of thought, 
a tiny smile in her mind. She 
couldn’t see the tribesman. Her 
father’s golden form blocked her 
view. If Sidney weren’t nursing a 
broken leg, he’d be beside her now, 
and then she could look past her 
father, but she’d rather have her 
view blocked, of course, than have 
that beast near her. 

She imagined the curtsey she 
would give Mycal, the look she’d 
have on her face — a trace of a 
smile, a tinge of a pout in the lips, 
a boldness in the eyes followed by 
a drop of lashes. She had practiced 
the look in the mirror. 

The plan swam before her mental 
consideration. It pleased her that 
Serenita had blessed it — although it 
was just a wee bit devious. But Re- 
gina didn’t care. Her energies 
flowed and raced, stimulated by a 
little drug mixed just for her lady- 
ship by her physician. 

This time I shall achieve it, she 
thought with determination. 

French watched her from the 
sideline with a brooding look. 
Proctor’s last words still rang in his 

GALAXY 




ears: “Never, never disobey me 
again!” 

I should have done as he’d or- 
dered, French thought. A part of 
his mind noted that Regina looked 
fit to kill — a veritable if slightly 
vulgar goddess. She was ravishing 
and knew it. If I’d have had some 
staff with me, another part of him 
brooded, all this wouldn’t have 
happened. 

I should have stayed behind that 
drum and killed them all. 

Half measures, he thought. Half 
measures. Now we’re in the soup. 

He felt Miri’s eyes on him and 
turned. She smiled and winked. 

French felt a sudden rush of af- 
fection, put an arm around her 
waist, and pulled her close. So long 
as he had Miri. Her body heat 
penetrated through the silk. She was 
soft to the touch and yet he could 
feel her strength. Nothing daunted 
Miri. She could have been a Branco 
chick — a fierce, passionate 
smuggler’s fern. He tweaked her 
hip, eyes on the scene. 

The Unifier had stopped before 
the delegation. An attendant noble 
disengaged himself from the entou- 
rage and carried the ornate key to 
Ricardo forward. He knelt down 
and held the pillow high so that the 
Unifier could take the key with his 
left. Then Bono stepped forward. 
The two men shook hands and the 
key was presented. 

Ceremony, French thought. 
Ornate Gestures of good will. 
Meanwhile we’re just waiting to 
knife one onother. 

His mind went back to the long, 
arid session with the sil-chemists 
that morning. They had explored 
every conceivable possibility, but 

helium 



ultimately they hadn’t been able to 
resolve the central question: Why 
would anyone want to weld 
silcoplast to anything? It could be 
done with copper, aluminum, and 
plastosteel. Simple: all you needed 
was a clean room, a molecular web 
der, and tightly controlled 
conditions — dust and random elec- 
trostatic fields had to be absent. 
Virtually every structure had the 
necessary facilities. But why do it? 
Such combinations had no possible 
use in any kind of communications 
system. 

At the center of action, Barney 
and Proctor had now joined the 
group and toasted each other with 
glasses from a tray held by a 
brightly clad servant. Behind the 
group Regina and the family waited 
patiently. 

The Unsler clan always amazed 
French by its size — all those 
brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, 
nephews. They all had a kind of 
dull sameness, the same long face, 
pouched eyes, drooping nose. 

Only two people stood out. One 
was Regina — a beauty. The other 
was Harvanth, a fat, ruddy man. He 
had married one of the Unifier’s 
four sisters and had brought into the 
Unsler clan a blustering kind of 
energy. They had put him in charge 
of Defense, an unimportant job that 
even a stupid man could do. 

The toast done, Unsler turned to 
introduce his family, and Regina 
advanced toward Bono. French 
watched with interest, wondering 
how the strict constructionist would 
react to the girl. 

Bono blushed when she came 
forward, her hands lightly grasping 
her long gown. She bent down be- 

61 




fore him in a curtsey so low he 
glimpsed the movement of unsup- 
ported breasts. His blush grew 
darker. Blue eyes locked into his. 
Then her lashes dropped and she 
withdrew. Bono felt an involuntary 
twinge in his bowels and caught 
himself staring at her center with 
stupefied intensity. Someone else 
had come forward and pronounced 
a name, but Bono barely heard it. 

He’d — he’d never seen anything 
quite so. .it was really quite ob- 
scene, but it hypnotized him! He had 
to resist looking at her again, at all 
those undulating snakes. They 
pointed to a spot in her center that 
now shimmered darker, and now 
not. 

Faces and names flashed by him. 
He shook hands and bowed ab- 
sently, while his mind touched fur- 
tive memories of short, guilt-laden 
sexual encounters. He knew very 
little about women, really, it came 
to him now. Strict constructionist 
training discouraged experimenta- 
tion. Chastity was the word — at 
least until you formed a harem. 
Bono had trespassed on that com- 
mand, of course. Drunk on fiery 
Wellhead whiskey, he had stumbled 
into the dark shacks on the other 
side of the refinery where the mu- 
tants lived. But those experiences 
had never been altogether pleasant 
in retrospect. You couldn’t call him 
an innocent, not really, still. 
Bono had never seen such a display 
before. She was a princess, after 
all, he noted with inward shock. 
The Unifier’s only daughter. 

The last of the family came and 
withdrew, and now the organ struck 
up a slow number, all fourteen 
notes jangling. Bono looked about 

62 



at the vast glimmer and shine. Well- 
head was very far away. The ball- 
room lay in a hush. No one 
moved. People stood on the edge of 
the empty dancefloor. Unsler’s fam- 
ily had arrounded itself on both 
sides of a throne before the foun- 
tain. Only Regina stood a little 
apart, alone. Her lashes were down. 

Dart whispered fiercely from be- 
hind: “Dance. You’re supposed to 
ask her to dance.’’ 

Now he remembered. Dart had 
described the whole procedure in 
the afternoon. The dance. 

He walked toward her, rigidly 
averting his eyes from the snakes. 
He looked at her neck instead, at a 
narrow red band around her neck, 
at little silver bells. He bowed. 
Again she curtsied, in response, 
and her nipples flashed. 

Then he held her and they swung 
out on the floor. 



THE BIRTH OF HAIRY-SCARY 

For some time now Proctor had 
conferred surreptitiously with mem- 
bers of the Group. He had just 
spoken with Justin Todd, an old 
friend in the Ministry of Engineer- 
ing, on whom he could rely to help 
hide the Interdiction. Todd’s peo- 
ple, jointly with Proctor’s, super- 
vised Helium delivery. And then 
Hondo Weinberger had also been 
by, his hair grey and unruly. Hondo 
was the architect of the surreptitious 
Media campaign. 

Proctor obtained perverse plea- 
sure from meeting the group here, in 
Top Level, but enough was enough. 

Roger Belmonte came toward 
him, the black commander of 



GALAXY 




Ricardo’s police and garrison. With 
a slight shake of his head, Proctor 
told the soldier from a distance that 
a meeting was inappropriate. 

Belmonte changed course. The 
red-gold jacket suspended from a 
button on his shoulder swung at the 
turn. Soon only the feather on the 
man’s triangular hat showed above 
the crowd. 

Proctor looked around for 
French, eager to chew on someone. 
The evening had been a sinister re- 
play of 1051 when Tack had chased 
the same seductive bitch with such 
disturbing consequences. Could all 
the intelligence forecasts be wrong? 
Proctor wondered. 

For a single, frightened moment 
Proctor imagined a scheme whereby 
Ecofreak arranged a charade to let 
BTA’s intelligence forces think that 
Activists had won. Once that notion 
was firmly set, they would swoop 
in for the kill, bypassing BTA in a 
bold bid for Regina, intermarriage, 
the whole lot. The thought made 
Proctor tremble. Under those condi- 
tions, there would be no Interdic- 
tion, no Secret Agenda. 

French! Goddamned, where was 
that man? He’d blundered last 
night, gunning down a man. Had he 
also blundered in his estimates? 

Proctor searched the crowd. 

Then at last he saw them. 
White-robed men had blocked his 
view, but now he picked out French 
and Miri just as they joined the 
dance. They turned around and 
around. Miri’s fringed stole flew 
through the air and light glanced off 
her single golden earring. Proctor 
watched French lead the girl across 
the ballroom, comer to comer. He 
lost the couple for a second; then he 

HELIUM 



picked them up again, somewhat 
closer this time. 

A strained expression on French’s 
face caused Proctor to glance back 
toward the spot where French and 
Miri had started. That group of men 
who’d blocked his view. .had they 
been flames? 

His searching look fell on Clafto 
Meyer flanked by three husky 
young men. They wove their way 
through dancers on the floor clearly 
in pursuit of French but at a sedate, 
leisurely pace. 

Proctor comprehended the situa- 
tion in a flash and experienced con- 
cern for French. BTA had no power 
in Top Level, while Sidney’s 
flames came and went here every 
day. On second thought, French 
was no fool — a hardy man, a veter- 
an of Hinterland. He had brains, 
good instincts. 

Proctor glanced back to his left 
and saw the couple again just as 
French broke off the dance and, 
pulling Miri under the balcony, 
raced for an exit. He nearly collided 
with a tray-bearing servant. 

From the other direction, Clafto 
and his followers came in hot 
pursuit, running now. They pushed 
mdely through the dancers toward 
the exit. 

Suddenly Proctor exploded in 
anger. It boiled up in him hot and 
steaming. He’d felt the fury ever 
since Blottingham’s tellcal, ever since 
that pear-shaped wonder had 
threatened him. Damnation, he had 
watched the bloody arrogance of this 
noble brotherhood too goddamned 
long, thank you. They could ravage 
the helpless masses of Ricardo all they 
liked, but BTA was a far cry from 
helpless. BTA was Proctor. 

63 




Deep down Proctor sensed a 
memory, but its content was out of 
focus. 

A counter-thrust, he thought, 
casting caution to the wind. 
Goddamned, I'll mount d counter- 
thrust. 

Turning cool, icy as rapidly as he 
had flared, he thought about the 
matter with shrewd calculation. 

Sidney’s flames came from Very 
Big families. BTA couldn’t kill 
such men without danger of severe 
retaliation. But if the counter-thrust 
was to have its desired effect, it had 
to be something. .shocking, jolt- 
ing, memorable. 

Proctor turned this and that 
around in his mind. Then he had an 
idea and began to elaborate on it. 
As he did so a smile faintly lit his 
features. The idea was neither very 
practical nor very rational. .but 
he found it irresistible for that very 
reason. Nobody would believe the 
flames, and therefore it might just 
work. 

He gave it a name: Operation 
Hairy-Scary! 

He snapped his concentration and 
began to look about. He had to 
have a talk with Belmonte after all. 
Tomorrow night, when BTA 
swarmed over the Acropolis to pick 
up flames, the police had to be 
conveniently blind. 



INVITATION 

As they had danced through the 
hours, Bono had fallen ever more 
deeply into a trance in which noth- 
ing seemed to matter but her 
scent, her feel, her warmth. He 
moved with the tide, aware that he 

64 



was drunk with stimulation and 
false hopes. 

He thought: The girl’s crazy 
about you. There is no other expla- 
nation. She has refused all others, 
and her eyes shine with a kind of 
admiration. 

Seconds later he took it all back. 
She isn’t really in love with you. It’s 
just this damn Adjustment thing. 
You’re making it all up. 

Shame possessed him, and he 
blushed recalling the stupid conver- 
sations between dances. They had 
nothing in common. “You are a 

“You are a rancher, Mr. 
Bono?’’. .“Yes, ma’m.’’. 
“Where is your land?’’. 
“In the Merilo district, on the 
Plain of Baez.’’ 

“You dance divinely.” 

“Ma’m, I — ” He’d stood beside 
her like a tongue-tied clod. 
Chocked up, plain and simple. A 
chasm yawned between them. 
Yet. Yet she clung to him for 
dear life. He could not be imagin- 
ing it all. Her eyes sparkled in such 
an odd way. 

Now they danced near one of the 
exits from the ballroom. She had 
more or less guided him toward it, 
and now she stopped. 

“Come,” she said, and she 
pulled him through. 

The heavy door closed, shutting 
off the noise of people, the jangle 
of music. In the odd silence, in a 
hall lined on both sides by mirrors 
and lit by lamps fashioned in the 
shape of candles, her eyes gazed 
into his, and then he found her in 
his arms. Her lips sought his in a 
hungry, almost angry kiss. After a 
moment she disengaged her mouth 
with a wrenching sigh, as if it

caused her pain to do so. His legs 
trembled with weakness. Bright, 
languid, yet teasing eyes looked 
into his. He bent to kiss her again, 
but she turned her head aside and 
shook it slightly. 

“When?” he asked in a voice 
almost harsh with emotion. 

“Tonight,” he husked. Where?” 

She reached up and pulled his 
head down so that her lips could 
whisper in his ear. 

“In my domain, you silly. Where 
else. Top Level West. The tower 
nearest to Hinterland.” She man- 
aged to give that a romantic sound. 
Her breath tickled and heated his 
ear. 

“But how?” He needn’t have 
whispered. They were alone, ob- 
served only by mirrors on either 
side. “I don’t know how to get 
about. I’ve been inside the embassy 
all week.” 

. Once more she pulled his head 
down. Her teeth gingerly bit the 
lobe of his ear, causing him to 
tremble all over. 

“Outside the main lobby — where 
you came in? Turn left and walk to 
the garage that faces Outer Ring. 

One of my people will bring you to 

- - - 1 » 

me. 

She let go of him and drew back. 

He took a step toward her, but 
she shook her head again. 

“Later,” she whispered. She 
puckered up her lips in the sem- 
blance of a kiss. Then she walked 
away from him, hand extended, re- 
flected in mirrors. 

When she had disappeared, Bono 
turned and walked back into the 
ballroom. For the first time in hours 
he became more aware of his sur- 
roundings and noticed that the 

HELIUM 



crowd had thinned, but in the mid- 
dle of the dancefloor hardy holdouts 
still twirled round and round. He 
picked a path along the edge of the 
dancers, walking next to columns, 
unaware of the knowing looks that 
followed him. He mused in a kind 
of strung-out way, thinking that it 
was true after all. She did love him, 
by God. And that meant that he’d 
soon be violating a sacred law of 
the Crestmore doctrine, but the 
thought left him indifferent. He 
knew the verse — who didn’t! “Thy 
seed shall not mingle with that of 
the whore.” It was written. But he 
couldn’t wait to pollute the pure tri- 
bal blood, he thought with an in- 
ward chuckle, didn’t give a damn, 
was delighted to do it, in fact. He 
picked up the pace, making for the 
lobby. 

Suddenly small, wrinkled Dart 
stepped out from behind a column 
and blocked his path. 

Bono frowned. 

“There you are, Mycal,” Dart 
said, eyes searching and disapprov- 
ing all at once. He side-stepped and 
continued beside Bono. “Ready to 
go home, call it a night?” 

“I have other business,” Bono 
answered curtly. “You go on 
alone.” 

“Mycal!” Dart grabbed him by 
his sleeve and stopped his eager 
forward rush, raising within Bono a 
sudden fury. 

“What is it!” Bono grunted. 

“If there is one thing I have,” 
Dart said dramatically, “it’s the 
courage to oppose. I oppose your 
whoring after structure flesh!” 

“Hold your tongue!” Bono 
hissed, glancing about furtively. His 
face had gone red, more from anger 

65 




than embarrassement. ‘‘I have busi- 
ness. I am not whoring after any- 
thing.” He tried to pull free, but 
the wrinkled claw held on to his 
sleeve tenaciously. 

Dart said: ‘‘The talks start at nine 
tomorrow. It’s nearly one in the 
morning. You must be rested and 
sharp. You can’t risk the future of 
the tribe.” 

‘‘Let me worry about that,” 
Bono spat back under his breath. 
He jerked his arm loose. ‘‘What I 
do is none of your business. Dart. 
Remember that!” 

He gave Dart an angry stare, 
turned, and walked away. 



PURSUED 

French pushed through a swing- 
ing door and pulled Miri behind 
him. Cooks in white tunics looked 
up in surprise. French swept the 
gleaming kitchen with a glance. His 
eyes came to rest on a heavyset 
butcher. In front of the man, stuck 
point down in a wooden block, he 
saw a big, sharp knife. 

He glanced at Miri and noted that 
her uncomprehending suiprise of a 
moment ago had yielded to cool 
awareness. He let go of her hand, 
whispered: ‘‘Keep with me, no mat- 
ter what.” She nodded as he moved 
forward. 

French stopped before the 
butcher, eyes on the knife for a 
second. ‘‘Which way is out?” he 
asked, looking up. The butcher 
stared back with an open mouth, 
clearly a very stupid man. ‘‘The 
back way!” French added, feeling 
strong tension. Precious seconds 
fled. Then he saw the exit, half 

66 



obscured by large pots hung on the 
wall. French grabbed the knife as 
he passed the butcher. It would re- 
place the pistol he had left at 
home — you didn’t go to Top Level 
social events armed. 

Past pots and pans he ran out, 
Miri breathing behind him. The 
stunned butcher yelled: ‘‘Hey! 
Heey, you!” The door cut off his 
voice. 

Senses sharpened by danger, 
French looked about with a flashing 
eye. Now they were in a narrow 
room. On the right a row of women 
stacked plates into a battery of dish- 
washers. Ultrasonic cavitators 
hummed. The women didn’t notice 
them. He ran forward, pressed into 
motion by the certainty of pursuit. 

Near the opposing door stood a 
wheeled cart loaded with stacks of 
dirty porcelain — precious, skin-thin 
stuff from Narodnik. He drew up 
short before the cart and gave it a 
shove. It sailed down the way 
they’d come, its tiny swivelled 
wheels wobbling. The butcher 
opened the door just in time to col- 
lide with it. French heard the crash 
of breaking skidding china as he 
pushed Miri ahead and out. 

They ran through a maze of cor- 
ridors seeking the exit toward the 
garage — but found only toilets, 
broom closets, pantries. French felt 
fatalistic about this crazy chase. 
Clafto’s face back in the ballroom, 
when, for a second, he had con- 
fronted French, had been too 
damned cocksure. Flames would be 
blocking all the exits. 

French kicked himself for his 
carelessness and softness. He 
shouldn’t have allowed Miri to 
come, should have anticipated this, 

GALAXY 




shouldn’t have let her talk him into 
it. Would he ever learn to say no to 
Miri? 

He raced ahead. Miri’s silk 
swished behind him. Now was the 
time for some of her magic, he 
thought wrily. They needed a spell 
that would transport them to their 
cubohome. Never mind, he added, 
I’ll bet Clafto has the place staked 
out. 

On one of the turns they sud- 
denly saw flames coming toward 
them and turned in the other direc- 
tion, running for a door up ahead. 
They ran to the door, went through. 
On the other side, -French found and 
activated a lock. Thank God for lit- 
tle favors! They had a second or 
two for deliberation. 

The room was dark. It took him 
a moment to see what it was. An 
empty dormitory! Beds were 
stacked five high to the ceiling, but 
clearly the place wasn’t used at pres- 
ent, the mattresses, seen in the dim 
red light above the door, were bare. 
An idea came to him and he de- 
cided to take a chance. 

He pulled Miri between a set of 
bunks. “Quickly. Get down,’’ he 
hissed. “Crawl under the bed.’’ 
She complied and he lay down be- 
side her. “Don’t move. Don’t 
breathe.’’ 

She settled down. For a second 
her gown rustled. Then all was still. 

Soon flames bounced against the 
door, tore at its handle, kicked the 
metal. This was followed by the 
silence of their consultations on the 
other side, and then by the dull re- 
ports against the metal of a heavy 
shoulder backed by body weight. 

The lock snapped at last and a 
big man tumbled in, bringing a flood 

HELIUM 



of light and, immediately behind 
him, a group of flames. Clafto 
yelled: “Up ahead, through there.’’ 
Boots ran along the aisle of the 
empty dormitory. A door slammed. 
It was still. The gamble had paid 
off. 

“Come,” French whispered. 

He ran to the door where Clafto’s 
herd had just departed, locked it. 
Then he led the way back. On the 
opposite end of the long corridor 
was another door just like the one 
Clafto’s men had broken down. 
Another dormitory? One for 
women, one for men? Another 
lock? 

His guess turned out to be right. 
They plunged into darkness. Once 
more he saw a red light at the end 
of a bunk-lined aisle. He locked the 
door and moved forward. 

He stopped below the night light 
on the other end, glanced at Miri, 
saw tension in her face. 

“Are you all right?” he whis- 
pered. 

Miri nodded. She was tense but 
confident. She’d never seen this 
side of Frenchy before — his concen- 
trated instinct and power. The knife 
in his hand glowed red in the light 
above the exit. Tiny bits of meat 
and fat caught in the serrations of 
the blade brought to mind that Top 
Level ate imported food, not hy- 
droponic substitutes. 

French turned to the door, 
grasped the handle firmly, and 
slowly opened it. Light drew a nar- 
row line down his face. He saw a 
wall. He opened the door wider. 

There he was! 

A heavyset young flame leaned 
against the wall out there, a pistol 

67 




suspended from his slack hand. He 
was evidently bored by his guard 
duty. French saw him yawn, saw 
him scratch his head. 

Very, very slowly, French closed 
the door. 

“Wait here,’’ he whispered to 
Miri 

He gripped the knife, the door 
knob. Five steps should get him to 
the flame and surprise would work 
for him. His throat was tight with 
excitement. 

One last glance at Miri’s tense 
face, then he leapt out of the dark- 
ness into the light. 

His sudden, flashing attack to- 
tally overwhelmed the flame. The 
man didn’t even have time to raise 
his weapon. His big, florid face 
turned slowly. Large, watery eyes 
stared. Then French drove the knife 
into the man, stabbing up through 
guts toward the lungs. The moist 
eyes, wide-open in innocent sur- 
prise, slid past French as the figure 
sank slowly to the floor. Blood ap- 
peared at tire man’s mouth, nose. 

French took possession of the pis- 
tol. Three quick steps carried him 
to the dormitory door. He reached 
in for Miri and pulled her out. 

She stopped and stared at the 
dead man from whose mouth a 
stream of blood had begun to flow 
down. The eyes were still open, 
still innocent but glazing. A wound 
in his center had begun to ooze. 

She took it all in with cool objec- 
tivity. Recycled. Back to the womb 
of the Cosmic lady, she thought, 
and she reflected that he’d be re- 
born again and would start his inter- 
rupted Journey over as a baby. 

“Come on,’’ French said, his 
voice edgy. He had glimpsed a door 

68 



down the hall with the word ‘Ga- 
rage’ painted in black letters on its 
grey surface. 

In the garage itself, dark at the 
point where they had entered, light 
up ahead where through arches 
French could see the upper portions 
of Outer Ring, he led the way to- 
ward a clump of jump tubes parked 
closely together. 

“Get in one of these,’’ he told 
her. “Quickly. Get down so you 
can’t be seen. I’ll look around a lit- 
tle.’’ 

He waited until she had disap- 
peared in what turned out to be one 
of the tubes of the tribal delegation. 
All the tubes in this cluster bore the 
circular Ecology symbol on the 
door, and French was reminded that 
the ancient greek tetter symbolized 
death. 

He hoped it wasn’t an omen. 

They were on the third or fourth 
floor of the parking lot, a simple ar- 
rangement with open sides. Thick, 
rectangular columns supported the 
roof. 

In the shadow of the columns, he 
ran to a spot from which he could 
oversee the down-shaft. He recoiled 
when he saw motion. Peering out 
more slowly, he recognized Bono 
and another man descending in 
jump tubes marked by the Unsler 
flower. 

Sooooo! French thought. Will my 
troubles never end? My noble strict 
constructionist already pants after 
the only fern he should avoid like 
the plague. Proctor will-Proctor 
will have a heart attack! 

He went toward the street side 
and saw what he had hoped he 
wouldn’t see — flames spaced at 
regular intervals on the sidewalk 

GALAXY 




below. That way was blocked too. 
Now what? 



ARMOR 

Regina ran out of the shower, 
still drying herself, to see if Selma 
had laid out the costume. She 
wanted to be ready and in position 
by the time the archangel arrived. 

Yes, the girl had done her work. 

The ruffled blouse and leather 
shorts with suspenders lay on the 
end of the large, canopied bed 
under the supervision of four large 
teddy-bears lounging against the pil- 
lows. White kneesocks with tiny 
red pom-poms on top — also ready. 
On the floor waited red leather 
shoes with thick, high heels. 

Regina smiled, pleased with the 
display. Shorts, suspenders, espe- 
cially the crossbar on the suspend- 
ers made of carved bone — all this 
would combine in a signal. A tribal 
touch, but not excessively tribal. 
The leather conveyed a hint of 
armor, of inaccessibility. Yet the 
shorts were very short and would 
give full play to her thighs — a touch 
of the necessary enticement to cap 
the matter off. 

As if the poor boy needed any 
more enticement! 

She slipped into panties and 
pulled them over her flat belly, across 
the shadow of her navel. 

Should she wear a bra? De- 
cidedly. Absolutely. She squeezed 
several in a row, standing before a 
cabinet with its drawer open, and 
picked the stiffest and most opaque 
one she could find. 

More armor. 

In a way she felt sorry for the arch- 

HELIUM 



angel. He was a very nice boy. 
She had found him clumsy and in- 
nocent. As for dancing, he hadn’t 
the faintest. Most clubfooted, 
clumsy. Not like her Jonny at all. 
She could like him, she decided. 
She might even learn to love him, 
although now it was all pretence. 

Her arms behind her back, she 
pressed the fabric together and the 
fibers locked. 

She put on and buttoned her ruf- 
fled blouse and slipped into the 
leather shorts. The horn buttons of 
the suspenders gave her a bit of 
trouble. They refused to go into the 
button holes. 

Serenita had approved the plan 
and had called her a clever girl. 
The nun had come in the afternoon 
for consultation, and for once she 
hadn’t worn her usual nunnish cos- 
tume but a long, blue robe and a 
simple cloth around her head, a 
very tall woman and surprisingly 
erect for someone her age. In her 
left ear had been a golden ring, and 
that ring now puzzled Regina. She 
had seen the identical ring on a 
woman at the ball. .or had she? 
Oh, never mind. 

“He will understand when it’s all 
over,’’ Serenita had said, seated 
primly on the edge of a backless, 
hassock-like seat in the conversation 
pit. Her understanding had surprised 
Regina, for the proposal was a bit 
unethical. She meant to use Mycal, 
to make him into a tool of her own 
designs, and Serenita should have 
disapproved of that as contrary to 
the teaching of charity. But the nun 
had nodded. “Now you must do 
anything you can to escape that 
worthless brother of yours.’’ How 
true. How true. “Afterwards, when 

69 




it’s all over, you can explain every- 
thing to him. He will understand 
and forgive you — ^I’m sure of it.” 

Yes, Regina thought, he’s a sweet 
boy. 

She pulled on her socks and 
slipped into the shoes. Fully dressed 
now she walked to the tall mirror 
by the shower door to look at her- 
self and found the image pleasing. 

The hairdo, of course, would 
have to go. 

Five minutes in that marvellous, 
computerized machine her hairdress- 
er had devised — ^he said it was the 
only one in all of Union, designed 
exclusively for her ladyship — and 
she would have, in place of this 
randomly curled Medusa pile on her 
head, two girlish braids on either 
side with a red ribbon in each. 

And then she’d go up into the 
garden and wait for him under the 
stars. 



AGONY IN THE GARDEN 

All around Top Level’s lobby, 
Bono had seen pictures of Union’s 
thirty-nine structures. Some were 
shown at night in a blaze of light, 
some in daytime against clear skies, 
yet others half shrouded in clouds. 

The sight of so many structures 
had filled him with awe. The reality 
of Union’s hundreds-some odd mil- 
lion people had impressed itself on 
his awareness. 

That was one perspective on the 
subject. 

Another was the inside view, 
what he had observed in the last fif- 
teen minutes or so — the Acropolis 
at night — on in the day time, for 

70 



that matter. In structures there was 
no difference between the two. 

Ricardo — a bright shining of 
glossy surfaces, deeply shadowed 
recesses. Everywhere light had 
bounced off blueish drilla-glass 
panes, large and small, convex and 
concave — like the eyes of an insect 
magnified a thousand-fold. Ramps, 
railing, flights of stairs cascading 
down or towering up. Squares, al- 
coves, fountains, mechanical birds 
twirping in artificial trees. Gigantic 
micromosaics blinking from tiny 
particles as he passed. The slither- 
ing, reddish, scaled surface of 
movebelts. Colorful clusters of 
flashing signs in empty shopping 
arcades. The breathtaking drop 
down Central’s shaft, passing level 
after level in a succession of 
bright-dark-bright all the way down 
to the mixing bowl. And now this 
sweeping vista that stretched before 
him — West Tower’s broken lights 
seen through the translucent roof of 
the hose-like intertower beltway. 

She lived up there. 

She lived up there. She lived in 
this city. Yet another perspective on 
the subject. 

Ricardo, fruit of a tree. Regina, 
sweet meat of the fruit. 

Bono explored the image. A map 
of the Helium pipeline in that Top 
Level lobby had suggested it. The 
pipeline resembled a gigantic red 
tree overlaid against the American 
subcontinent. Its trunk ran south 
and north. Its branches reached 
from coast to coast. At the end of 
each branch hung a structure. The 
roots of the tree reached deep 
within Texahoma and sucked 
Helium from five red pools, all of 
them near Wellhead, where the gas- 

GALAXY 




fields had been discovered three 
hundred years ago — a new forma- 
tion since the wars, perhaps caused 
by the wars, gas fields whose 
methane was rich with Helium. 

The gas came from the ground 
and went through refineries. Cryo- 
expanders stripped off the methane 
leaving the Helium. It travelled 
through slender pipes up the trunk 
of the tree. Once he had put his 
hand around it. His fingers had al- 
most touched his thumb. And yet 
that small artery sufficed to raise 
these magnificent constructions. 

His admiration for the structures 
was excessive, of course. Regina 
colored his thoughts. Wherever she 
was, there was magnificence. 

The poisonous fruit of the 
Helium tree held a sweet kernel that 
he would taste. How could he reject 
the structures? 

He wanted to get there. “Show 
me how to drive one of these 
things,” he said to the servant who 
travelled beside him. Bono pointed 
at his own jump tube, which the 
man operated by remote control. 

Later he sat in a dark lobby of 
“her ladyship’s domain,” as the 
servant called it. He paced up and 
down, nervous like a caged beast. 
At last a thinnish young woman 
with large eyes appeared at the 
door. She had a face perpetually in 
an expression of astonishment. 

“The mistress is waiting for you 
in the garden. Please follow me.” 

She led him through halls and 
rooms, a veritable warren of rooms, 
some small and cozy, some large 
and expansive, but all of them in- 
credibly wealthy and beautiful 
— mirrors, tiny fountains, glass ta- 
bles, cabinets, soft crumpled 

HELIUM 



couches, statuettes, glistening 
mobiles, tables and chairs, exquisite 
micromosaics. The lights were dim 
and he sensed in the shadows more 
rooms, more nooks, more mys- 
teries. He heard a faint whispering 
of music. 

He had a vague thought of 
paradise and underneath that a tre- 
mor of anxiety. 

I’m not worthy. 

He couldn’t believe any of this. 
The experience had a dreamlike un- 
real quality. He followed this girl 
through a. .museum of wonders. 
He smelled perfume. Somewhere 
she waited. .for him! It boggled 
his mind. 

A devilish part of his brain re- 
minded him that he had come to 
Ricardo to destroy it. He’d sat on 
his poly staring at the poisonous 
fruit and had imagined it crumbling, 
falling down. 

Madness, foolishness! 

He meant the Crestmore doctrine. 
Right now he couldn’t understand 
what the fuss was all about. 
Perhaps Mycron Crestmore had had 
a point at one time. But now the 
mad antagonism between Structure 
and Hinterland made no sense at 
all. The two had lived side by side 
for centuries. 

Heretical thoughts, chided his 
devilish self. My, my, Mycal. How 
you can twist and turn the facts 
when you want to. .when you 
want her! 

Bono shook his head in protest as 
he followed the girl over carpets of 
irridescent sheen, delicate tiles, 
polished parquette. 

Nothing new, this doubting. He 
recalled his adolescence when he 
had stared at refineries, compressor 

71 




stations, copters, laboratories, rock- 
ets, cannon, temp-control devices 

. .He had thought then that all 
these things were also Technology. 
He’d smiled inwardly when he’d 
been told that tribesmen only used 
Technology to defeat Technology. 
He had always wondered. Now, 
after all these years, the doubts had 
simply come to the fore again in the 
presence of structure life — which 
didn’t seem so terrible after all. 

I really had no concrete idea, he 
assured himself. No idea at all what 
it was like. 

It was enchanting — the whisper 
of music, the strands of faint scent 
floating in the air, the warble of 
water somewhere, the girl hiding 
somewhere here. 

Well, yes, dammit, the girl! 

They don’t know anything back 
home, he thought with sudden irrita- 
tion. 

The servant had stopped before a 
glass door. Through it Bono saw a 
stairway curving out of sight. His 
own image — boots, beaded leather 
clothing, dark, bearded face — was 
mirrored faintly in the glass. 

“The mistress waits up there. 
Just go on up.” 

He pushed the door open and felt 
an inrush of humidity, smelled a 
garden. 

Nodding to the servant, com- 
pletely intent now on what lay 
ahead, he went through and up the 
stairs. 

Halfway up he noticed open sky 
above glimpsed through a curving 
dome of glass faintly reflecting 
light, a deep blackness richly 
sprinkled with ^ wash of stars. He 
hadn’t seen the sky in days. The 
Milky Way clouded across his vi- 

72 



sion overlaid by closer, brighter 
luminosities. 

He went on around a spiral. 

He stopped at the head of the 
stairs and saw a garden under a roof 
formed by numerous small domes. 
Telescopes stood in a row on his 
left. Lamps on two sides behind a 
profusion of plants bathed the roof 
in a faint light. A gravelled path 
stretched ahead. A fountain played 
at its termination. Olive trees, 
palms, tropical bushes, flowers in a 
riot of color filled the place, closely 
packed and lush, exuding a rich or- 
ganic smell. 

The garden must have cost a for- 
tune to install, must cost a daily 
fortune to maintain. The whole 
place had to be completely shielded 
from gravitron — like mush tanks. 

He sought her with his eyes and 
saw her at last half hiding in a 
small moon-shaped clearing off the 
path smiling from the depth of a 
large piece of canvas upheld by 
four steel stems that fanned out of a 
thick stone base. She had crossed 
her legs and her chin rested on two 
up-held fists. 

She took his breath away. She 
had transformed herself from a sul- 
try goddess into a sweet, lascivious 
child — braided hair, white ruffled 
blouse, and tiny shorts that gave 
full play to a pair of thighs the 
color of milk above the tan. 

She smiled at him for a long, 
breathless moment. Then, with the 
grace of a kitten, she jumped up 
and ran toward him. She nearly 
leapt into his arms. 

He kissed her with mad abandon. 
He crushed her to his breast. He 
groaned with an overload of emo- 
tion, a murky feeling of Joy and 

GALAXY 




longing and breathless surprise. 

For a long time they kissed, em- 
braced, pulled back to look at each 
other. Then they went around 
again. Each time was more and 
more tumultuous, a rising sym- 
phony repeating a theme at octaved 
intervals. He grew frenetic with 
passion. 

The tension mounted. 

He kissed her, hugged her, and 
held her close because he didn’t 
know how to go on. In those dark 
and filthy shacks in Wellhead, 
bored naked women had waited 
while he’d dropped his pants. This 
situation called for a ceremony of 
disrobing. But where to begin? She 
didn’t help him. He had to make 
the first move. 

Regina, for her part, began to 
weaken rapidly as their sustained 
endearments continued. She felt the 
warmth of passion rising slowly. 
He was so deliciously inept. She 
fought the urge to yield, to help 
him. She was aroused! She — who’d 
been subject to the most sophisti- 
cated methods of seduction used by 
men who fancied they knew a bit 
about the art of love. That she 
could handle. This was something 
much more dangerous for all its in- 
nocence. Very human, her bearded 
angel. A real passion throbbed in 
this artless, unskilled man — in more 
ways than one. She could feel his 
swollen organ pressed hard against 
her center. When Bono began 
clumsily to grop around her back 
for an opening — she felt the irrita- 
tion of his hands as they encoun- 
tered the rigid strappings of her 
suspenders — she nearly panicked 
into submission. But she pulled her- 
self together. She had to follow her 

HELIUM 



plan, no matter how inconvenient. 
When he intensified his search with 
something approaching. frenzy, she 
suddenly slipped out of his. grasp 
and stepped back. 

Her face was blank with desire, 
the red of her lips enlarged by kiss- 
ing. She shook her head. Her eyes 
brimmed with affection. 

“We musn’t,’’ she said. “Not 
that.” 

“What do you mean,’’ he 
rasped, completely out of breath, 
chilled with irritation. 

“Honey-sweet,” she said, and 
she came back to him now but with 
her arms protectingly up front, 
hands curled into balls beneath her 
chin, “I can’t strive with you, little 
darling, not yet.” 

“Why not?” he barked, his eyes 
in a terror. “Why? Why not?” 

Bono had a terrible premonition 
that she would elude him. He felt a 
dark confusion. Everything about 
her told him she desired as much as 
he. The sensation of her own lust 
merely amplified his own. 

“Oh, sweetheart,” she whis- 
pered, “don’t be so furious. I love 
you, truly! But I’ve been disap- 
pointed before.” 

At the moment, strangely, she 
did love him — or maybe it was just 
her hormones? 

“I love you,” he breathed, and 
he took her in his arms again, pos- 
sessively, fiercely. But she 
blocked him from her softness 
and resisted his artless tugging. 

Did he truly love her, she won- 
dered. Or was he, like she, under 
the venal spell?’ 

“I know, I know,” she 
whispered. Whatever they now felt 
was real enough in its way to be a 

73 




substitute for love. “I know, 
Mycal. But I won’t be hurt again. I 
need your true commitment.” 

‘‘You have it,” he said hastily. 
‘‘Truly. I love you.” Once more he 
began to seek an opening on her 
back. 

She thought: He still hasn’t 
grasped that it can’t be tonight, that 
I must have more. 

She wished it didn’t have to be 
so. She wanted to conceive, so 
much, so much. Conceive? It was a 
stray thought, and she put it aside. 
What she wanted, obviously, was to 
yield. She wanted to put her plan 
aside, take his hand, and lead him 
to her favorite room, her favorite 
divan where, across from the gold- 
laced mirrors, she could lie down 
and give him leave. But this time 
she was determined to win. Like 
crazy, menacing laughter, another 
world was there, in a comer of her 
mind — a future much like the past, 
a future which might become worse 
after Daddy died and Sidney be- 
came ruler of all. 

My plan, she thought almost 
hysterically. My plan. 

Slowly but firmly she pushed him 
back. 

Bono saw her shake her head. ‘‘I 
must have more,” she said. 

‘‘Name it,” he cried. ‘‘I promise 
you! You’ll have it.” He was all 
fervor and conviction. He’d give 
her the Milky Way itself, rolled up 
in a canvas bag. 

She looked at him with an ex- 
pression so sweet, so filled with 
longing, he forgot the lust he felt, 
that sublimial rage which was ready 
to burst forth, that strange vacilla- 
tion between hope and despair. Her 
look was questioning, timid. 

74 



‘‘Do you really love me?” 

‘‘Truly, I do!” He made a step 
toward her, but she retreated. 

‘‘Then take me with you to Hin- 
terland.” 

Bono felt a surge of joy. Was 
that all? Was that all her little heart 
desired? Nothing he longed to do 
more, nothing easier. He relaxed 
again. He would possess her yet. 
He could meet her price — and more: 
he wished desperately to pay it. To 
have her by his side was his own 
most fervent longing. 

“Yes,” he effused. I promise.” 
Once more he made an advance, 
thinking that now the bargaining 
was over. But then he saw with a 
wary eye that those words were not 
enough. She retreated further, all 
the way to the moon-shaped behind 
a lawnchair, put it between them. 

‘‘Darling,” she said, ‘‘please 
don’t be angry. I shouldn’t have 
asked you to come. But I so wanted 
to see you again. We won’t strive 
tonight. Please don’t expect that. I 
won’t do that until you’ve made 
your commitment.” 

Bono was devastated. 

“But how?” he asked. His voice 
had the sound of suppressed tears. 
“What do you want me to do?” 

She looked at him; she hesitated. 
Now she would learn the extent of 
his commitment. In this moment, 
she cared as much for his commit- 
ment as she did for what it would 
bring her — escape. 

She took a deep breath. 

“This round,” she said, “I must 
be the Helium hostage. Only then 
will Daddy let me go. Ask for me, 
darling. And when I see it reported 
on the Media, I‘ll be yours.”

GREG 

HARTMAN 



The purpose of diplomacy 
is to further the careers 
of diplomats! 



The ancient castle that housed 
the Terran Embassy seemed one 
with the mountain it topped. Carved 
of the same muted stone, ponderous 
walls blotched with the same 
mustard-colored lichen, it merged 
imperceptibly into the living rock. 
The two figures which soared from 
it and flew east could have been 
eagles bursting from their aerie. 

They were birds of more subtle 
powers. Diplomats. 

“There’s the problem,’’ Jana 
Blinton shrieked, gesturing to the 
verdant valley a klick below. 
Twisted shrubs dusted the steep 
sides in random outbursts, but the 
narrow flat bottom had been par- 
celled into neat rectilinear patches. 
Among them moved dark ants: 
Kronigian serfs tending their mas- 
ters’ crops. 

With a cry of delight Civerie 



Llan adjusted his belt and swooped 
down. Safe from prying eyes, Blin- 
ton treated herself to a grimace. The 
priests who ruled Kronig disliked 
humans spooking their people. If 
they saw a senior Embassy official 
like this idiot of a Naval Attache 
breaking the rules. 

Of course, the way things were 
going they might all be kicked off 
Kronig by winter anyway. 

Blinton checked her wrist chron. 
Two hours till the meeting with the 
Ambassador. She should be rein- 
forcing her lobbying efforts with the 
other department heads. But then, a 
jaunt with Llan was lobbying too. 
He was an unknown factor, a man 
who’d been Naval Attache only 
since his predecessor’s accident 
three weeks earlier. How would he 
vote when she presented her report 
and the assembled egos proceeded 
to clash? 

Llan continued to disport himself 
below. Damnation. She jerked at 
her belt and shot off into the wind, 
letting the pelting molecules cleanse 
her face for the fight ahead. Strip 
off the loose skin, wind; only a 
bone-and-muscle Blinton dares at- 
tack the Ambassador’s overwhelm- 
ing inertia. Cumulonimbus boiled 
over the range ahead, promising a 
storm. She flew directly into the re- 
freshing hi-oxy air, the air that, 
along with its strategic location, 
made Kronig so valuable as a poten- 
tial R&R base for the sector. 

And how simple the elements 
are, she thought, compared to the 



EFHCIENCY

Embassy infighting. The clouds 
loomed. 

“Hey, slow down,” buzzed the 
bone-phone behind her ear. Llan 
closed from behind, epaulets askew. 
One meaty hand reached for her 
thigh as he neared. She dodged. He 
had to settle for the forearm-forearm 
hold decreed by belt etiquette. 

“The natives certainly seem in- 
dustrious,” he said, trying to make 
conversation after an awkward 
pause. 

“They have to be. Low solar 
radiation, primitive farming 
techniques. Adds up to a lot of 
labor per unit of protein.” 

A rift in the stormfront revealed 
the dark growth of a castle on the 
range before them. “Veer left,” 
Blinton said, turning Llan to fly 
parallel to it. 

“Why?” 

If you spent more time studying 
the planet and less time with your 
damn Navy intrigues. Blinton 
kept her face locked in the meek 
mask a civilian learned to wear 
around members of the military 
clans. “These people may be on the 
brink of starvation but that doesn’t 
keep the priests from fighting to ex- 
tend their parishes. That’s why you 
see so many castles. Another pro- 
duct of war is suspicion. Paranoia. 
They worry about spies. If we want 
to be allowed to stay on the planet 
we don’t want to look like snoops.” 

“They don’t seem to mind 
Molots in their airspace. Look.” 

Out of the sky dropped a tiny 



cruciform airship, abristle with pods 
and nacelles. It hovered above the 
fortress for a few seconds, blinked 
its lights, then settled out of sight 
inside the walls as the clouds closed 
in again. 

“That’s the third visit in aS many 
days. Something must be done,” 
Llan scowled. 

Well said, commander. Blinton 
ignored the hand fondling her 
forarm — the man was already fa- 
mous as a womanizer — as she re- 
viewed the problem for the coming 
meeting. 

Kronig; a planet with a medieval 
culture and equivalent technology. 
Under a cool sun members of the 
dominant theocracy compete for 
power, straining already slim re- 
sources. 

Suddenly it became part of a 
galactic community, with two com- 
peting stellar civilizations eager to 
bring it into their respective sphere 
of influence. The priests hold back, 
unsure of which to trust. 

As consul general and head of the 
original Tenan legation, she’d been 
using Terran technological expertise 
to solve minor problems for the 
Kronigians while her staff traced 
out the workings of the society. It 
seemed to be paying off. But two 
months ago the legation had been 
upgraded to embassy status. The 
ambassador placed over her had 
brought with him a swarm of 
bureaucrats and other functionaries. 
She still didn’t know the reasons 
behind the shift; frontier posts were 



78 



GALAXY 




usually under rather than over- 
staffed. Probably a high-level power 
struggle between the Throne and the 
Navy. But whatever the reason, her 
efforts at winning the Kronigians’ 
trust had been aborted by the new 
Ambassador and his cronies. 

Today’s move would be her big 
try to get things moving again. If 
everyone liked her report — 

“Say, don’t you think we ought 
to head back?’’ Llan tugged at her 
arm. The first long tendril of rain 
splattered over them. Blinton felt 
nothing inside her polymer coverall 
but the Naval Attache’s dress un- 
iform, so ludicrously unsuited for 
flying, was already half soaked. She 
remembered his pass and an im- 
pulse flared. 

“What’s the matter, comman- 
der?’’ she cooed. “Afraid of a little 
water?’’ She squeezed his arm lest 
he break away and with an alluring 
smile flew into the storm. 

Thunder jolted the conference 
room as she concluded her report 
and flowed back into her chair, toss- 
ing her red mane for effect. Light- 
ning and more lightning etched eva- 
nescent half-tone images of the 
counselors scurrying to seal the 
embrasures against the storm. Blin- 
ton glanced at Llan, noting his 
still-damp curls. But he refused to 
meet her eyes. She bit her lip as she 
waited for reacitons, hoping the 
soaking hadn’t turned him com- 
pletely against her. Could he take a 
joke? Damn all impulses! 

EFRCIENCY 



“An interesting analysis of 
Kronigian economics.” That was 
the Counselor for Xenological Af- 
fairs, a shabby rabbit. His opinion 
meant nothing in these circles, 
which was why he usually spoke 
first. “Balanced.” Well, the Logis- 
tics Secretary was verbose today. 
What, no others? The heavies were 
holding back. Blinton scanned the 
table, but gazes flickered around her 
without intersecting. And their fin- 
gers: a ring of anemone tentacles in 
fitful drift. Bad signs. She braced 
herself. 

The rasp of dry palms rescued 
her colleagues from uncertainty. 
The Naval Attache. He straightened 
up and spread his arms wide across 
the polished pseudo-wood, looming 
larger as more of his body came 
into view. “I thought the Consul 
General’s report was very interest- 
ing,” he said, head slowly rotating 
to bear on each of the others. “It’s 
got some fine ideas. But 
overall” — his eyes locked on 
hers — “it’s poorly thought out.” 

Blinton’s social mask never 
flinched. “I think it’s very 
straightforward. Eighty-nine per- 
cent of the Kronigian population 
are serfs engaged in primary agri- 
culture, barely producing enough 
to prevent starvation. We could al- 
leviate their miserable lot by intro- 
ducing crop rotation, animal breed- 
ing techniques, awareness of subtle 
ecological interactions. Boosting 
crop yields would mean more food 
and also encourage long-range 

79 




trade with the surpluses, thereby 
breaking down some of Kronig’s 
provincialism.” 

“Unemployment would also in- 
crease, since fewer serfs would be 
needed to feed the population,” 
Llan needled. “Wouldn’t that create 
crime and unrest?” 

“I dealt with that in appendix 
F.” 

But I didn't want to stress it, 
damn you. 

“I calculate the excess population 
would be displaced to the market 
towns. It would provide the labor 
for the crafts which would expand 
as trade increased and a money 
economy replaced barter. 

There would be temporary disloca- 
tions, of course, but the gradual na- 
ture of the change — several genera- 
tions at least — would mitigate the 
impact a great deal.” 

Llan leaned back in his chair, 
frowning. What was he up to? She 
hadn’t expected opposition half this 
overt. 

She sneaked a glance around the 
table; all were intent on the Naval 
Attache’s dramatics. So much for 
her lobbying. 

Llan raised his head. Blinton’s 
stomach clenched. 

“There are two major problems 
with the Consul General’s plans,” 
he stated. “First, it’s not spectacu- 
lar enough. She proposes sending a 
few score socio-agronomists out 
into the countryside to spread good 
farming techniques. Suppose the 
Molots countered with an offer of 



self-propelled plows good for 50 
years of service. Who would look 
better?” 

“But that would make them de- 
pendent on an advanced technology, 
whereas my idea — ” 

Llan swept on. “Second, suppose 
the priests did accept our offer. 
Consider the social impact. Not Just 
crime, but generations from now 
when the market towns become 
cities and flex their political mus- 
cles. Against the priests. How 
favorable toward the Terran Hegemon 
will they be when they realize we’ve 
set them up?” 

Murmurs flowed about the table. 
Llan looked at the Ambassador and 
lifted his shoulders apologetieally. 
“Of course. I’m just a simple mili- 
tary man,” he said, reminding them 
of the power he served. “I don’t 
want to monopolize the discus- 
sion.” 

He sat back as they grilled her, a 
half-smile drifting over his full lips. 
Blinton already knew how the vote 
would go if she forced the issue, so 
she fought to minimize her losses. 
On they ground for 80 minutes as 
each department and section rep 
dashed in to whack his coup stick 
against the proposal already half 
bludgeoned to death. Good little 
bureaucrats that they were, most 
worried about the long-range power 
shifts. She tried to explain that les- 
sening the priests’ grip on the planet 
needed to be done eventually, if 
only to stop their wars. But to no 
avail. 



80 



GALAXY 




The Ambassador listened fitfully 
and doodled, probably thinking 
more about plans for his party. But 
at last he bestirred himself. 

“Obviously Consul General Blin- 
ton’s proposal needs more study. I 
suggest she prepare additional re- 
ports analyzing the questions raised. 
Analyzing them in detail." A 
wrist-flip dismissed the documents, 
some 400 pages thick, scattered 
about the table. You bastard, she nod- 
ded. 

“And when she returns with the 
additional information — in several 
months, I should imagine — we can 
consider her proposal again. And if 
it has merit, we’ll form a committee 
to study the matter further.” 

CONSUL GENERAL she was enti- 
tled to eat in the Executive Dining 
Room. But Blinton prefered 
cafeteria utility to ambassadorial os- 
tentation: waiters, three forks per 
person, meals that dragged on for 
hours. She drifted through the lower 
ratings, nodding, looking for — ah 
ha. The Personnel Officer. 

“Mind if I join you?” she asked, 
with a barely perceptible pause be- 
fore dropping down. Jeremy smiled 
over his tray, eying her bare midriff 
as he nibbled on a stalk of red veg- 
etable protein. 

“Haven’t seen you in here late- 
ly,” Blinton trilled. Not for four 
days anyway; that’s how long I’ve 
been laying for you. 

“Been busy with the Ambas- 
sador’s new idea. Contingency 

efficiency 



planning. You'll probably be hit 
with it soon. Everyone will have to 
draw up plans for dealing with ev- 
ery conceivable emergency. 
Quakes, plague, war, insurrection, 
new vices. Ain’t nobody or nuthin’ 
gonna ketch this embassy by sur- 
prise.” 

But who does the real work while 
this planning goes on? Blinton stab- 
bed her fork into a chunk of 
meatmeal. She could see it now. 
Department meetings to announce 
the need for contingency plans. 
Another meeting to gather ideas. 
Days wasted threshing them out, 
deciding how to best meet emergen- 
cies. Write a first draft; hold a 
meeting to discuss it. Rewrite. 
Submit to the Ambassador’s ad- 
ministrative assistant arid a week la- 
ter it comes back with “in- 
adequate” or “part IV needs more 
work” scribbled in the margin. 
How could her staff study Kronig if 
everyone had to waste time 
brainstorming how to cope with an 
infinity of improbable emergencies? 

But then the Ambassador proba- 
bly didn’t want any real work done; 
taking action meant taking risks. A 
policy might backfire and interfere 
with his chances of snagging a post 
on a more civilized planet. Blinton 
had seen it before, which was why 
she requested frontier assignments. 
The people were generally younger 
and had to be more hard-working if 
they wanted to rise. The Ambas- 
sador, though, had reached the age 
where he couldn’t afford a mistake. 

81 





So he kept the Embassy playing at 
busy work while the Molots moved 
in and the Kronigians grew more 
paranoid by the day, jeopardizing 
the whole Embassy. 

She shoved her plate away. 
“When’s the next personnel allot- 
ment due?” 

“I don’t know. Something’s hap- 
pening in the Dulbaniq sector and 
our staffing is frozen for the dura- 
tion.” 

“Another ‘protective reaction’ 
against the Molots?” 

He shrugged. “Even my sources 
in communications don’t know. 
Whatever it is, the Ambassador 
won’t get his 32 new people until 
it’s over.” 

Thirty-two? Rage mounted; she 
fought to keep her face normal. The 
Ambassador’s latest increment was 
more than her entire staff in lega- 
tion days. The Embassy was chok- 
ing on flesh; no wonder nothing got 
done. 

Blinton activated the spy screens 
concealed in her chron (in case 
someone had a bug on her) and 
leaned forward, hand masking her 
mouth against cameras. “Jeremy, I 
need a dozen agronomists. When 
you set up the talent profiles for the 
new 32, you could slip them in. I 
don’t care what their primary roles 
are — they can' be psychs or mechs 
or even stenos. Just get me 12 
people who know something about 
farming and I’ll handle the transfers 
once they’re here.” 

She hunched her shoulders as she 



whispered, letting her halter-vest 
gape. Come on, look at my breasts. 
You were hot enough for them once 
before. But Jeremy rubbed his nose 
and scratched an elbow, looking 
away. “Could you get me six?” 
she pleaded. 

“One of Llan’s assistants 
monitors the outgoing material. 
Security, he says. I might not be 
able to slip it past him, and if it 
was spotted I couldn’t justify it. 
You’re the only one in the Embassy 
who wants farmers. I’d like to, but 
I can’t.” 

It was cool and dim in the cham- 
bers of the Kronigian equivalent of 
pope. Enticing aromas tickled her 
nose; the furnishings or the Kroni- 
gian himself? Blinton shifted un- 
comfortably on the high knobbed 
stool as he puffed up his bladders to 
speak in fluting whistles: “You 
promised us many things. Tools. 
New materials. Knowledge. Yet 
since your initial gifts eleven cycles 
of eleven have passed with nahght 
but talk. Why?” 

Why indeed? Blinton remembered 
her inspiration to give them a few 
score telescopes, which would be 
useful and have minimal cultural 
disruptions. But just getting in to 
see the head of the sociology de- 
partment had taken two appoint- 
ments. Appointments! In her lega- 
tion days an intercom call would 
have sufficed. Once she’d pene- 
trated to Westerial’s inner sanctum, 
the woman had stalled her for a 



82 



GALAXY 




staff report. The excuse was that 
she was still waiting for said report, 
but Blinton’s informants said Llan 
had found out about her idea and 
vetoed it. 

How can I explain bureaucratic 
inefficiency, an Ambassador who 
prefers planning parties to nego- 
tiating, and a Naval Attache who 
checks my every effort? Damn 
Llan. The Ambassador’s inertia is 
understandable, but the Naval At- 
tache is smart enough to realize 
what will happen if the Molots get 
in and distrupt the Kronigian cul- 
ture. Why is he — 

She realized the priest was impa- 
tient. Hurriedly, she said, “Unfor- 
tunately the ship that was supposed 
to bring our new gifts was delayed. 
We hope that in a few — ” 

His whistle was high-pitched. 
“The last two ships have brought 
many humans. What do they do?” 
Good question, although asked 
for paranoid reasons. She frowned 
at the computer translator hanging 
between her breasts. “It takes many 
humans to fully study your world.” 
But that didn’t satisfy. The head 
priest began to reel off the names of 
everyone who’d been assigned to 
the planet when the legation was 
upgraded to embassy and demanded 
to know what each did. The Am- 
bassador was easy to explain; she 
called him the new head priest. But 
how to present the difference be- 
tween a sociotech and a recreation 
therapist? And why the Embassy 
needed six of each? 



Blinton struggled along but when 
he dismissed her she knew he 
wasn’t satisfied. She studied the 
simple tomic on the seneschal’s 
torso as he led her out. Its sole dec- 
oration was a green stripe around 
the waist. Utilitarian, like the bare 
stone walls of the castle corridors. 
Bare even of Kronigians — they 
didn’t clutter up their homes with 
excess retainers. Blinton thought of 
the Terran Embassy and her office, 
and wondered how she could feel so 
lonely in the midst of so many 
people. Perhaps she should take an 
old friend to bed tonight, instead of 
that Programs Analysis Officer 
she’d been working on. 

A dark figure in an alcove broke 
her reverie. A Molot. Wearing the 
cobalt and blue chevrons of the dip- 
lomatic corps where its light gray 
body turned ebony on its dorsal sur- 
faces. Like a great frog it squatted 
there, looking out the narrow em- 
brasure. Waiting its turn for an audi- 
ence? Under one short arm a metal 
case gleamed. Blinton let the 
seneschal continue on as she froze, 
squinting at the alien characters on 
the box, then hurried after. 

An atomic drill, she thought 
numbly, as she lofted into the even- 
ing sky. More than just a useful 
tool to snag the Kronigians on ad- 
vanced technology. A potential 
weapon. 

It took her four days to find an 
agreeable code clerk, three hours to 
bring him to her room. While he 



efficiency 



83 




slept, drained, she injected him with 
3 cc of di-sodium lithanol and im- 
planted a sequence of subconscious 
commands. 

Three watches later, while encod- 
ing a routine status report, he trans- 
posed two digits. 

The new code combination would 
have requisitioned a complete set of 
memory cubes on farming through 
the ages. Unfortunately a sharp- 
eyed naval cadet caught the “er- 
ror.” Blinton learned of the clerk’s 
demotion when he came shuffling 
by for a consolation screw. She 
soothed him, sent him on his way, 
then soared off skyward where she 
could rage in safety. 

The ambassador’s party took 
place in the castle’s great hall. 
Glo-globes emitting bursts of hu- 
man, Molot and Kronigian colors 
drifted under arches and between 
columns; tangers wafted an odd 
scent calculated to relax the olfac- 
tory organs of all three races. How 
festive we must seem to our 
enemies, Blinton thought, nodding 
automatically to passing humans. 
She swirled the nektarile in her snif- 
ter, wondering how long she had to 
stick around. 

She tried to count the humans 
present but gave up at 205. Nearly 
the entire Embassy was present. 
Depressing, to see so many people, 
so many unfamiliar faces, with ev- 
ery human on the planet pulled into 
one place by the social event of the 
year. She let the current carry her 



into an alcove with an ecologist {the 
ecologist!) from her original lega- 
tion staff and they drank to the old 
days. But his caresses failed to 
cheer her. 

The Ambassador meandered 
through the crowd, syncophants ed- 
dying in his wake. Through her 
glass Blinton studied the bits of 
metal and plastic decorating his 
chest. Forty years till I’m pen- 
sioned; what are my chances of an 
Embassy command and being able 
to straighten out this messed up dip- 
lomatic service? To be precise, 
what are my connections in either 
the Navy or Throne? She tossed off 
her drink and went in search of 
more. 

Buck up, Blinton, get to work. 
Talk respectfully to your superiors. 
Share a joke with your equals. Be 
polite with just a trace of conde- 
scension (keep ’em in their places) to 
your inferiors. So what if this planet 
is lost; you’ve still got your career 
to think about. There’ll be other 
conferences, other votes. So get out 
there and mix. 

A trio of Kronigians wandered 
by. They halted to talk to the Am- 
bassador and automatically arranged 
themselves in a triangle to cover 
each others’ backs. A Kronigian 
gathering must be pretty wild, Blin- 
ton thought, smiling at the defense 
posture. Oh oh — the Ambassador 
was trying to chat with them with- 
out using his translator. The aide 
behind him winced and motioned 
for another drink.

“Isn’t it a wonderful party?’’ 
Jeremy materialized at her side, one 
hand discretely tucked in that of a 
long-limbed woman in an engineer- 
ing uniform. 

“Best one I’ve been to all 
night.” Blinton eyed the find: good 
breasts. The engineer looked away 
though. Already taken. Best leave 
her alone anyway; Jeremy was too 
useful to alienate. Unless they 
wanted to try it with three. 

She started as the Personnel Of- 
ficer took her arm and leaned close. 
“The Navy boys are annoyed with 
a certain diplomat who keeps trying 
to go outside channels. As long as 
they think they’re outmaneuvering 
you they’ll let it go on, but if they 
decide you’re putting one past 
them, there may be some overt re- 
sponse.” His eyebrows arched for a 
moment and he disappeared into the 
throng with his new friend. 

Moodily she climbed up into one 
of the pulpit-like structures extrud- 
ing from the columns. At least up 
there she didn’t have to play the po- 
lite social games with people she 
didn’t like but had to placate. Ah, 
there was Llan, holding court down 
by the stocks. Lesser Navy officers 
surrounded him; others dotted the 
hall. 

Lots of Navy officers. 

Blinton lowered her snifter, 
frowning, and began to count the 
Navy men present. Llan’s planetside 
staff consisted of only 13, plus 
those manning the watch ship. 

The Navy protected its secrets, of 



course, but the ship contingent was 
supposed to be only a handful. 

She counted 35. 

Over half wearing the blue roset- 
tes of Llan’s clan. 

Blinton studied her antagonist. 
The party had drawn his followers 
out of their hiding places in the sky, 
but even so there must be some left 
to man the ship. Say, a minimum 
watch of eight. That meant he had 
43 to 45 officers assigned to him. 
Three times the normal staff for a 
minor planet like Kronig. Especially 
in peacetime — 

So that was it. 

Blinton closed her eyes and 
slumped against the cold stone pil- 
lar. Of all the corrupt, foul, 
loathsome — Mastering herself, she 
let the party burst upon her senses 
again and chugged her drink. She 
dared not be weak. 

No wonder Llan blocked her ef- 
forts. He didn’t want the Terran 
Hegemony to negotiate a successful 
treaty with the Kronigians. He 
wanted the Molots to succeed, so 
that a war would result. Perhaps not 
immediately, but a few years down 
the line, the Navy would denounce 
the increasing Molot influence in 
the sector and launch a “protective 
reaction.” Military action equals 
career advances. Simple. And who 
would be in the best position to be- 
nefit but the naval staff on the 
scene, already thoroughly back- 
grounded. 

Blinton arranged her face and 
carriage and started down the stairs.

placing one foot carefully in front 
of the other. Wouldn’t do to have 
an accident now, oh no. She’d have 
to be very careful in the coming 
months. People who get in the way 
of well-laid schemes have a demon- 
strably higher accident rate. 

Options: take Llan to bed? Make 
a peace offering of her body? It was 
a tactic that had served her well in 
the past, but satyr though he be, she 
doubted he’d halt his rise to power 
for a good lay. 

Assassination? In her career she’d 
avoided the temptations to eliminate 
rivals, although several times she’d 
had opportunities. But for these 
stakes. She could invite him fly- 
ing, just a casual jaunt — let him 
think it a peace offering. Play up to 
him a bit, and when he made a pass 
let him get in close and tap a 
scrambler against his spine. 

No, he’d be too cagy. Navy of- 
ficers don’t rise without having sur- 
vived dozens of simple assassination 
attempts of the sort a novice like 
herself could muster. And then a 
Navy Star Chamber inquisition — out 
of the question. She shuddered. 

She let the crowd sweep her 
away and reverted to her social 
greeting mode. Nod, smile, stop to 
joke, smile, an extra second of eye 
contact for you, squeeze an arm. 
And she thought: she could always 
just give up. “Yes, isn’t it a grand 
party! And your outfit. .’’ She 
could pretend not to know what was 
going on, wait for the routine trans- 
fer to another world, and not get 

86 



crushed in Llan’s machinations. 
“Oh, I think she’s being outra- 
geous. Too much quoppe.’’ How 
would it feel to live inside one’s 
head after abandoning a planet ot a 
Navy-Molot war? 

“Madame Jana Blinton. My plea- 
sure.’’ 

A Molot squatted before her, 
great bulk slumped on the 
flagstones, upper appendages spread 
in a gesture of greeting. She replied 
in turn, which was the signal for an 
involuted monologue on a fine point 
of Kronigian botany. Skillful ban- 
ter, she noted professionally, before 
drifting back to her own worries. 
This creature was the fourth point 
of the maneuvering between herself, 
Llan and the Kronigians. His enig- 
matic race was expanding through 
the same arm of the galaxy as the 
Terran Hegenomy. With a differ- 
ence. While humanity ballooned out 
in a sphere centered on Old Sol, the 
Molot domain was a cylinder of 
constant radius expanding at both 
ends. Actually no one knew for sure 
what the far end was doing, but the 
one intersecting human space was 
giving Throne and Navy planners 
alike something to worry about. 

She had a sudden vision of 
planets stacked atop one another in 
a great pyramid through time, with 
Kronig at the base. And herself 
fighting off those who wanted to 
pull it out and. bring the stack crash- 
ing down. Damn. If only she were 
free to act — 

A void in the conversation jerked 

GALAXY 




her out of her brooding. She 
realized both of the Molot’s eye 
clusters were on her. No, lower. 
Her empty snifter. 

“1 said, if you humans concen- 
trated more on work and less on 
pleasure, perhaps you would ac- 
complish more.” 

It would be amusing to violate 
every diplomatic and ethical tradi- 
tion by smashing his face in. No, 
the Molot was baiting on purpose. 
Why? She opened her mouth to 
reply — and heard a faint whistling 
behind her. 

She lifted her glass and 
scrutinized it, adopting a mock- 
serious expression for the Molot’s 
benefit. The reflection showed a trio 
of Kronigians behind her. Waiting 
to see what she might reveal in a 
moment of alcoholic carelessness. 

Her mind cleared; inspiration 
flared. She giggled and staggered 
forward a step. ‘‘You wait and see 
what the Ambassador’s going to 
do,” she said loudly. ‘‘He isn’t 
bringing all those people here just to 
study flowers.” With that she 
lurched off toward the bar, wonder- 
ing if she hadn’t Just thrown away 
her career on a very long shot. 

Skull-throb pounding; burst of 
interior drum savagry. Blinton roll- 
ed over, grimacing, trying to shut 
out the noise. Finally she conceded 
to herself that she was awake. 
“Who the hell is it?” she grum- 
bled, fumbling for the light. It sear- 
ed her eyes. When she could see 

efficiency 



she found the chron. 0500. ‘‘Shit.” 
Blinton lurched out of bed and 
found a robe. Belting it loosely 
shut, she heaved the antique 
wooden door open. 

It was Llan. Just what her hang- 
over needed. But he was panting, 
and his uniform mussed for the first 
time since he’d come to Kronig. 
What— 

‘‘Something’s gone wrong,” he 
ground out. ‘‘The head priest just 
announced we’re being kicked off 
Kronig and we’ve 48 hours to be 
gone.” Two men dashed down the 
hall behind him, shouting. 

Blinton’s hand closed her robe as 
his eyes dropped. Did I succeed? 
‘‘All of us?” she asked. 

‘‘No, we blustered and argued 
and finally convinced them to allow 
a skeleton staff to stay on. It’ll be 
the original legation you headed. 
They’re not afraid of that,” he 
sneered. ‘‘Of course you won’t 
have the personnel to do anything, 
just show the flag and negotiate for 
the return of a full embassy.” He 
sighed and pulled out a crumpled 
list. ‘‘Now here’s what the Ambas- 
sador wants you to do while he’s 
gone. First, contingency planning.” 

He was gratified to see her burst 
into tears at the extent of their pre- 
dicament. It confirmed his opinion 
of her as a female who didn’t have 
what it took for real responsibility. 

But he could not understand why, 
when he tried to take her in his 
arms to comfort her, her knee came 
up so sharply. ★

SCIENCE FACT 



JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 



A SUP 

FARTHER 

OUT 



TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE— 
A DIMINISHING RESOURCE? 



FEW WEEKS AGO I was Called to settle for me. It was an interesting 



testify before the California Legisla- 
tive Committee on Energy and Di- 
minishing Resources. The very exis- 
tence of such a committee is a sign 
of the times: no one would have 
expected the legislature to spend 
money and effort on such issues a 
few years ago. 

It was even more surprising that 
they would ask a science fiction 
writer to appear on a program that 
included Joseph Coates of the Of- 
fice of Technology Assessment; 
Herman Kahn of the Hudson Insti- 
tute; Paolo Soleri, arcologist ex- 
traordinary; and a star-studded 
group of academic experts. 

To be honest, the Committee 
originally wanted another science 
fiction writer and science columnist, 
but he wouldn’t travel from the East 
Coast to California; so they had to 

88 



experience all the same, and I thank 
Dr. Asimov for putting my name 
into their hopper. 

I’m not at all sure the hearings 
were as useful as the Chairman, As- 
semblyman Charles Warren, thought 
they would be. To begin with, the 
committee hearing format isn’t too 
productive. There wasn’t any inter- 
change among the participants; in- 
stead, each “expert” gave a set 
presentation, followed by a few min- 
utes of questions by Committee 
members who might or might not 
have been listening to what had 
been said. 

That kind of dog and pony show 
doesn’t always produce exciting 
new ideas. With every word taped, 
and plenty of time to think in ad- 
vance about what you’re going to 
say, you tend to be rather careful. 

GALAXY 




It’s going to be public record, after 
all, and if you make specific predic- 
tions you may be called on to ac- 
count for them sometime in future. 

As a matter of fact, that’s one of 
the topics I chose to speak on: how 
to get more information and ideas 
across the barrier from the scientific 
community to the political commun- 
ity. 

There are a lot of formal 
mechanisms for transmission across 
that barrier. There are commissions 
and institutes, and staff conferences, 
and formal papers — and every one 
of them suffers from the defects in- 
herent in such formal systems. 

You don’t get the nuances, and 
you don’t get the wild ideas that 
just might turn out to warn politi- 
cians of an upcoming problem. 
When you write a formal paper you 
don’t know just what your audience 
knows (and what it doesn’t know 
but can’t admit publicly that it 
doesn’t know). 

As a matter of fact, one of my 
suggestions was that the Committee 
members make a firm resolution to 
take a scientist to lunch once a 
month, with no formal papers and 
no statements for quotation. A sec- 
ond suggestion was that there ought 
to be periodic conventions with no 
program; science people and politi- 
cal people ought to be put in an at- 
mosphere of informal conversation 
and left to communicate. 

I don’t know if it will work, but 
I’ve seen a lot of good come from 
downstairs meetings held while 



formal papers are being read in the 
convention ballroom. 

OTHER PROBLEM was a discre- 
pancy in expectations. The Commit- 
tee Chairman wanted specific pre- 
dictions. The political authorities 
have been hit with a series of crises: 
inflation, energy shortages, pollu- 
tion, the ecology movement, col- 
lapse of aerospace as a major 
employer, etc., etc., and it seemed 
reasonable to Mr. Warren that the 
Committee might get a hint of what 
was to come, so that the legislature 
wouldn’t have to operate in a con- 
tinuous atmosphere of crisis man- 
agement. 

I didn’t hear all the testimony, 
but most of the experts seemed 
more inclined to discuss philosophy 
and sociology, rather than get 
specific. One chap did talk about 
diminishing resources, specifically 
metals like tin, but even there he 
had to say there were tradeoffs that 
would help weather the problem. 

I don’t think the Committee 
members were expecting a 
philosophical debate; but in a very 
real sense maybe that’s precisely 
what’s needed. Obviously mist of 
the expert witnesses thought so. 
Here’s why: until you have some 
basic assumptions about the nature 
of the future, you’re going to have 
real problems planning for it. 

The lead-off speaker was Her- 
man Kahn. I hadn’t seen him for 
perhaps ten years, although of 




A STEP FARTHER OUT 



89 




course I’ve read a number of his 
works. He hasn’t changed, except 
that he’s grown a short, full beard; 

Herman is a fascinating speaker. 
He generates strong emotions in 
people: very few can listen to him 
without either nodding in agreement 
or violently shaking their heads. 

No one wants to argue with him, 
because those who take him on in 
debate generally lose. That doesn’t 
mean that Herman is invariably 
right: it just means that you’ll prob- 
ably lose a debate with him. 

Plato mentions that phenomenon 
in his dialogues: an opponent is si- 
lenced but not convinced. Herman 
has that effect on people. On the 
other hand, he can be pretty con- 
vincing, too. 

The Sierra Club representative, 
asked later about Herman’s presen- 
tation, summed it up this way: 
“You’ve just heard a massive dose 
of Pollyanaism from the Boss Pol- 
lyanna of them all.’’ The fact that 
Herman Kahn had, during his tes- 
timony, offered to prove that the 
Sierra Club cost the US over 25 
billion dollars in the past few years 
may have had something to do with 
their representative’s attitude, of 
course. 

Herman Kahn’s presentation was 
basically one of philosophical world 
view. There are two currently im- 
portant views, Kahn said: Neo- 
Malthusian beliefs, which can be 
summarized by saying the world is 
a finite “fixed pie’’ out of which 
we can take just so much and no 



more; and a Post-Industrial view 
that says the world-model should be 
seen as a growing pie, with no one 
able to predict what we can pro- 
duce. 

He went on to summarize both 
views, and to describe one of his 
characteristic tricks that excite either 
admiration or hatred. In his public 
lectures, he passes around charts 
that summarize the two would views. 
Then he asks the audience to 
vote on which view they hold. 

He also asks them to vote on the 
confidence with which they hold it, 
and there’s where the joker comes 
in. The Neo-Malthusian summary is 
stated in dogmatic terms. There are 
no qualifiers in it at all. 

The Post-Industrial perspective is 
full of qualifiers such as “within 
limits’’, and “no one knows but the 
best guess is’’, and “if we are 
reasonably prudent’’, and the like. 

He’s been conducting this poll all 
over the country, and the results are 
a little frightening. Most college 
students accept the Malthusian 
perspective — and profess a great 
deal of confidence in it. 

As Herman points out with some 
glee, there’s got to be something 
wrong with an educational system 
that produces this result. It may be 
that the Malthusians are right, but 
no one has a right to be that 
confident — and particularly no one 
has a right to be confident about the 
view as Herman wrote it. 

It’s more dogmatic than any 
medieval scholastic’s catechism.

GALAXY 




THORSTE^N VEBLEN OnCC WrOt^ 
about “trained incapacity.’’ Herman 
Kahn called it “educated incapaci- 
ty.’’ Our schoojs, he said, are sys- 
tematically teaching not only unreal 
views of the world — but views 
which are known to be unreal. 

He was taught in high school, for 
example, that “wars never settle 
anything.’’ Now anyone who cares 
to can in about five minutes come 
up with a list of at least a hundred 
things that wars have settled. 
Canada is English, not French. The 
Third Reich does not control the 
Suez Canal and the Middle East oil- 
fields. Israel exists. 

Yet for generations students were 
taught the catch-phrase “wars never 
settle anything.’’ Perhaps they 
don’t, but it’s certain that if that 
cliche eontains a truth it’s a subtle 
one not learned by ceaseless repiti- 
tion. 

As another example: Neo- 

Malthusian arguments are generally 
based on exponential curves. An 
exponential curve is one that rises 
slowly at first, gets steeper and 
steeper, and eventually becomes 
near vertical. You can fit an expo- 
nential curve to a number of mod- 
em phenomena: population, pollu- 
tion, energy consumption, depletion 
of natural resources, etc., etc. 

On the other hand, there are no 
exponential curves in nature. 
Natural phenomena that look like 
exponentials turn out in the long run 
to be “S” curves. That is, at first 
they look like exponentials, but 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



eventually they turn just the other 
way. Given the latest census data, 
for example, the population trend of 
the US is much better fitted by an S 
curve than by an exponential. 

Now there’s more at stake here 
than the teehnical question of which 
curve best fits present trends, be- 
cause as Herman is fond of pointing 
out, more and more educated people 
simply accept what they’ve been 
taught without even considering that 
there might be an alternative: and 
that fundamental world-view trans- 
lates into action. 

Indeed, anyone who seriously be- 
lieves that the world is on an expo- 
nential road to crisis and die-off 
must try to do something about 
it — or confess to having no more 
moral sensitivity than a weasel. 

I’ve been through my exercise in 
“technological optimism’’, and I 
won’t subject GALAXY readers to 
it again (just now); but it’s interest- 
ing how the testimony of the ex- 
perts did seem to bring out one 
point — and by accident I made that 
point the central theme of my own 
testimony. 

There’s pretty general agreement 
among both Neo-Malthusians and 
Post-Industrialists that we’ve got 
some problems, and if we’re to find 
a way out of them we’ll need some 
highly educated talent. Technology 
got us where we are, and created 
most of our problems. It will take 
technology to get us out of them. 

It doesn’t matter which way you 
think is “out”, either. Even if you 

91 




believe that the only hope for the 
world is to de-emphasize technolo- 
gy, change our goals, learn to settle 
for fewer gadgets and gimciicks and 
miracle drugs and Coca-Cola and 
transistor radios and high quality 
stereo systems and electric canopen- 
ers and paperback books and cheap 
trips to Europe and cheap nylon 
backpacking gear and sleeping bags, 
and the rest; even if you’d like us to 
go to the simple unspoiled life, get- 
ting there is not going to be easy. 

The Luddite solution — “Smash 
the machines!’’ — is not going to 
lead to high quality of life for very 
many people. It may even lead to a 
counter action by those who operate 
those machines or depend on their 
output. 

On the other hand, if you believe 
with Herman Kahn that the world 
population is likely to stabilize at 
around 15 billion in the 21st Cen- 
tury, and that we’ve got the re- 
sources to produce a Gross World 
Product of some $20,000 per capita 
for those 15 billions — and do it 
forever — you still can’t think it’s 
going to happen automatically. 

“It’s going to take people who 
understand technology whether we 
want to have more of it or start 
dismantling it. 

Despite our enormous investment 
in public higher education, it’s 
doubtful whether we’re turning out 
the people we’ll need for the world 
of tomorrow. 

As Joseph Coates of the Office of 



Technology Assessment put it, ask 
a recent college graduate in any- 
thing other than the hard sciences 
and engineering what he or she 
thinks they’re prepared to do. A 
growing number of people invest a 
great deal of their lives in this 
magic thing called “education’’, 
which they are assured will let them 
live better lives — and find at the 
end that there’s little demand for 
their “skills”. 

The United States, Coates said, 
has become very middle class. That 
has some benefits: when there’s an 
automobile accident, it doesn’t usu- 
ally generate a fist fight. Instead we 
call our insurance company and the 
police. 

We expect, in other words, that 
the System will have methods for 
dealing with our problems. If it 
can’t, we expect it to change until it 
can. 

That leads to a number of side ef- 
fects. One is credentialism: we 
don’t ask if you can do a job, but 
ask what credentials you have to 
prove that you can do it. I think of 
a case near at hand: my wife 
teaches teen-age illiterates to read. 
She works in a detention center. 

When she first went there she 
was hired under a contract that 
stated quite plainly that unless those 
kids learned to read, she didn’t get 
paid. She gets paid, so there’s ob- 
jective evidence that she knows how 
to do her job. 

She also has to take classes in 
order to keep her position. It’s in- 



92 



GALAXY 




teresting to look at the experience 
and performance record of some of 
the “experts” she has to take class- 
ses from. 

Another side effect is increasing 
detachment from the primary pro- 
cesses: Coates listed a number of 
specific questions (among others, 
“How is this nylon rug made? 
Where do sesame seeds come from? 
How does a satellite get up and 
what keeps it there? Through how 
many hands does our food pass 
from farmer to our table? What 
does a carburetor do? How does 
television work?”) that he claimed 
most ‘educated’ people couldn’t 
answer. 

To my horror he got nods of 
agreement from much of the assem- 
bled company. They were all col- 
lege graduates and many were offi- 
cials on whose decisions our lives 
depend. 

Ortega y Gassett wrote fifty years 
ago that the “mass man” accepts 
the products of civilization as a kit- 
ten accepts milk, with no more un- 
derstanding of civilization than the 
cat has of dairies. 

That brings us at long last to my 
own presentation: a crisis predic- 
tion. 

People are living longer, and 
fewer are bom. The trend is easily 
seen: we have an aging work force. 
By the end of this century — in fact, 
well before then — we’ll have many 
more retired people and compara- 
tively fewer productive workers. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



No problem is more easily fore- 
seen, but I’ve yet to see anyone 
planning for it. 

Now we have also encouraged 
political activism, and we have ex- 
tended the franchise to nearly every 
conceivable group. Certainly all 
those retired people are going to vote 
to keep their standard of livving 
from falling. 

Where’s the money — or produc- 
tive goods if you think we’ll be 
beyond money by then — to come 
from? Certainly not from savings. 
Social Security has no money, only 
bonds, which is to say the authority 
to tax. The whole Social Security 
system is geared to a growth 
economy. It assumes you can tax 
the current work force to support 
the retired work force — and there- 
fore assumes that the current work 
force will be larger than the retired 
group. 

That’s not going to be the situa- 
tion within a few years. 

The only way out is either a gen- 
eral lowering of everyone’s living 
standard, or increased productivity 
per employed worker. Or both. The 
recent trend in productivity isn’t en- 
couraging, though; it’s going down. 

As a technological optimist my 
suggestion is to get productivity 
back up. The Neo-Malthusians will 
doubtless have their own sugges- 
tions, but the problem is quite real, 
and quite predictable. 

Query: is our educational system 
organized to produce the trained ta- 
lent we’ll need to meet the crisis? 



93 




I’d say no. In a recent visit to 
UCLA Book Store I noticed that the 
largest single book section was re- 
served for “Subject A’’ textbooks. 
Subject A is the modem euphemism 
for what was called Bonehead En- 
glish in my day. 

I suggest that when California, 
said to have the best public higher- 
education system in the world, can’t 
find among all its dozens of Univer- 
sities and State Colleges and 
Polytechnical Universities and 
Community Colleges, one under- 
graduate institution that doesn’t take 
in students in need of Bonehead En- 
glish, we’re in trouble. 

Sure, the state should provide a 
means for correcting deficiencies in 
lower level education. If education 
is conceived as a magic leveller of 
class differences, then Bonehead 
English at the top undergraduate in- 
stitutions makes sense; but if public 
higher education is supposed to be 
an investment for the future, it be- 
comes questinable. We need one 
public university that takes only the 
cream of the student population. Cal 
Tech can’t possibly produce all the 
really top-flight engineers and scien- 
tists we’re going to need. 

Higher education has another in- 
teresting phenomenon: department 
budgets are based, not on projected 
needs for graduates thereof, but on 
enrollment. The more students a 
department can attract, the larger its 
staff, the more promotions for its 
faculty, the more undergraduate as- 
sistantships, and the more public re- 



sources that department is given. 

In effect the public authorities are 
inviting recent high school 
graduates to allocate educational re- 
sources. Control of perhaps our 
most important public investment is 
left to those who by definition 
haven’t the qualifications to do it. 

The freshman student is expected 
to predict for himself where he’ll be 
needed: to make the most funda- 
mental decision of his life in the 
atmosphere of an oriental rug mar- 
ket. He’s given very little help, and 
the public interest is hardly rep- 
resented at all. 

The results are grim. Our educa- 
tion systems look as if we think our 
future problems will be solved by 
training enormous numbers of social 
scientists, teachers, and the like. 
Does anyone seriously believe this 
method will meet the problem of 
producing enough goods to support 
those retired people we know we’ll 
have around in a few years? For 
that matter, does anyone seriously 
believe that expanding departments 
of education makes sense at a time 
when birth rates are at an all-time 
low? 

SCIENCE magazine recently pub- 
lished a study of employment 
among engineers and scientists. As 
you might expect, technically 
trained people have the lowest un- 
employment rate of all groups in 
this country. There are specific 
problem areas, and middle-aged 
aerospace engineers in particular 
have employment problems, but by

GALAXY 




and large there’s more demand for 
technically educated people than 
there are graduates. 

This is hardly the result of plan- 
ning. In 1969 the technical profes- 
sions were hard hit by government 
cut-backs. As a result fewer stu- 
dents enrolled in those departments. 
Now we have shortages. This will 
spur demand, which will build up 
enrollment. SCIENCE says “The 
experience of geologists — who eight 
years ago were a glut on the market 
and are now at a premium — is like 
a bad parody of manpower plan- 
ning.” 

That, boiled to its essence, was 
my presentation. Because I’m a sci- 
ence fiction writer and it was ex- 
pected of me, I talked a bit about 
far-out technology: bringing 

icebergs from the Antarctic to Los 
Angeles to meet our water shortage, 
using the thermal capacity of the 
Sea of Cortez as a long-term solu- 
tion to the energy crisis, laser- 
launching systems to get orbital 
power plants, and that sort of thing. 
None of it would be thought far-out 
by GALAXY readers, as indeed 
none of it is; I was careful to stay 
with concepts that have a fair 
chance of economic feasibility 
within the next 30 years. I expect 
that’s what drew most of the atten- 
tion. 

That sort of thing, though, is im- 
plied in my choice of world views. 
If you accept the proposition that 
technology can, intelligently 



applied, cope with the problems 
technology has created, then it be- 
comes a matter of hard study as to 
which technological solutions ought 
to be investigated. 

If you don’t accept that proposi- 
tion, then any specific technological 
suggestion is probably obscene, 
since it implies that we ought to use 
even more resources to bail our- 
selves out of the short term crises, 
thus putting off the fundamental re- 
structuring we’ll have to face some- 
day. 

I wasn’t paid for my appearance 
and I didn’t have long to prepare 
for it. I expect I should have made 
a bigger impact than I probably did. 
Even now, though, after listening to 
the other experts, and thinking 
about what I should have said. I’m 
still convinced that my prediction 
was correct: we’re about to face a 
shortage of trained talent, and our 
education establishment isn’t geared 
to do anything about it. 

I remain an optimist: we’ll do 
something. But I wish those respon- 
sible for investing public money in 
higher education would stop and 
take a long look at what we’re do- 
ing and what we’re going to need in 
future. 

At the least, couldn’t we sub- 
sidize tuition in engineering colleges 
as well as find scholarships for 
those in the big departments? And 
can’t we have one undergraduate in- 
stitution that just won’t accept stu- 
dents who need Bonehead En- 
glish? ★ 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

That which has never lived 
can never die! 

TO SEE 
THE CITY 
SITTING ON 
ITS BUILDINGS 

Hb WAS ONE of the last old people 
of summer and he came out on a 
hill, maybe the only hill left. They 
were gathered there. The old, the 
young, and the no longer restless, 
all gathered. And he sat by the cold 
fires and not knowing or caring if 
any listened he said “I will go do 
what I have to do.” The trees and 
birds listened. The people listened. 
It was a time when all things lis- 
tened for there were soon to be 
none left to speak. 

The people looked at him like 
birds seeing tom feathers. They said 
‘‘The world ends tonight. You can 
not leave your song here and go. 
Do not leave your song here. It will 
warm itself by the fire. It will wait 
for you by the fire. But not for 
long.” All this was said with 



tumed-away faces and with silence. 

They said ‘‘Do not go. Your 
song will go outside to wait for you 
when you do not return. It will sit 
away from the fire. It will get 
cold.” This was said with busy mo- 
tions and precious moments. That is 
what they said. 

‘‘Tomorrow is cold for all songs,” 
he said. And they knew he was right. 
They knew he was right. 

‘‘I will go,” he said. 

‘‘How will you go,” they asked. 

‘‘I will go as an owl. I will go 
see the city sitting on its buildings.” 
And quietly, like a hawk without 
claws, he went away over the soft 
ground. 

And the people shook their heads 
as he went. And the old ones, 
thinking of him, could not see his 
face in their minds. He was an owl 
and owls when the world ends say, 
‘‘Don’t look at me with your 
eyes.” 

There was a place he went to 
first. It was above the city. It was a 
high place built of concrete and 
steel on ground where once a hill 
had stood. It was built there so that 
one could take pictures of the city 
to send home. He was not there to 
send pictures home. 

He who had lived his life in a 
long shadow of a city now felt the 
first moment of going from a dark- 
ened room out into the light. 
Somewhere down there in the 
shadow of the city, the sky was 
hidden. He knew his strength by the 
distance he could see and down 



TO SEE THE CITY SITTING ON ITS BUILDINGS 



97 




there in the city, he would be blind 
and bent in shadows. But he had to 
go down there. And the world was 
ending and all the city was ending. 
In his heart he knew it was ending, 
knew that the grey place that did 
not live was ending but his heart 
knew it was not enough. 

He drew his arm across his face 
in a wing and feather motion, 
shielding his eyes from the sharp 
face of the sun. Softly like a bird he 
moved, like a bird about to soar. 
He said, “I will fascinate you. I 
will tear out your eyes with spirit 
teeth.” 

And he laughed and laughed. 

And below him, the city sat on 
its buildings. 

And he laughed and laughed. 

And Detroit screamed on its 
wheels. 

And Chicago slid on slaughtered 
animals. 

And the old man sucked it up in 
his breath. The panic of an animal 
city was like telltale smoke to an 
owl. 

And Los Angeles waited like 
pregnancy in unmoving traffic. 

And the skyline of New York, 
for the first time, did not cast any 
shadows. 

And the old man tore it away like 
cobwebs and laughed and laughed. 

And the closed eyes of animals 
with their heads to the ground, 
moved slowly with flies. 

And the old man saw it. He saw 
the city burning. The concrete, the 
steel, the brick and iron, all burn- 



ing. And the wood of dead trees 
was rusting. And he laughed, sharp- 
ening claws he never had. And 
there was a song, a little song from 
his memory and it too was burning. 

And the song said ‘‘Go to sleep 
and do not cry. Your mother is 
dead and still you feed upon her 
breasts.” That is what the song 
said. It was the end-of-the- world 
song of a hungry spider who spins 
his web, knowing how to die. 

Back there on the hill, the old 
man’s song got cold waiting for 
him. And the people set all the 
dances on fire. All the dances on 
fire. And they packed them away 
still burning with handfuls of dirt, 
red earth like pipestone. They gave 
the dances all burning to mother 
earth. Only mother earth can keep 
dances when the world ends. 

The old man stood in the harsh 
glare of the city, wrapped in the 
soft protection of folded wings of 
memory. The air around him was 
alive with flame as his memories 
got stronger and the earth moved 
beneath him with the power of liv- 
ing before him and after him. He 
felt the earth moving under his feet 
like a child spinning around and 
around in a secret place known only 
to boys. Tomorrow was cold and 
burnt away to ash. But in the secret 
place that lived yet inside of him, 
the current was slow and the warm 
brown river seemed to be standing 
still. 

And the reason that had sent him 
away from the hill, when the people 



98 



GALAXY 




gathered, came up the brown river 
and he could not say her name. No, 
he could not say her name. Not 
even now when the world was ending, 
could he say her name. For the dead 
take their names with them out of the 
world. 

But he thought of her in this time 
of the coming back, in this time of 
the world ending and coming out of 
the ground. His old woman had not 
come out of the ground. That was 
why he was there. That was why he 
was there to see the city sitting on 
its buildings. 

There to see the city that had 
hidden the sky. The other people 
had buried their city on her grave. 

He listened. He did not hear the 
scratching of her fingers as she 
clawed at the city above her. Or did 
he? Was the long animal cry of the 
city her cry too? Was it her 
moving-in-the-grave sound? 

The ears of the owl are sharp and 
he listened. And then he knew he 
heard her. The owl can hear many 
things when the world ends and he 
heard her. The scratching, the pain- 
ful scratching of her moving. 

“She can not come up through 
the sidewalk’s concrete.’’ he said. 
That is what he said. And in his 
face he took her hammer and beat 
her name into ashes and beat those 
ashes into a hammer. But the spirit 
calling of her to come was not 
enough. They had buried a city on 
her grave. 

He closed his eyes and he said, 
“I will wait and watch. I will not 



go down there yet. I will not speak 
and see if they do not move the 
city. They do not need the city any- 
more. Maybe they will tear it down 
now.’’ 

He was an owl and that is what 
he said. 

But they did not move the city. 
He waited and watched. An owl 
waited and watched but they did not 
move the city. The other people had 
buried their city. It was behind 
them even though they still lived in 
it. They had buried their city. 

He was an owl and he knew this. 
He had heard them. He saw them 
through the eyes of sick animals. 
The sun was going to come at them 
and they had gathered together like 
a swarm of locusts. They were like 
storm-frightened cattle and the 
wings of frightened birds brought 
their words to him. They said 
“Let’s swim to the moon.’’ 

He was an owl and that is what 
they said. 

The old man looked up at the 
flaming sky of high-sun time. It 
was hot like a pot oven and the sun 
was spinning like a wounded spider, 
dangling closer to its prey on a 
single strand of fire. It filled the sky 
and moved quickly to the west. 
Moving fast like a thrown spear, the 
sun pulled night after it like a blan- 
ket. It was dark coming at noon. It 
was the end of the world coming 
and darkness and flames. Flames 
and then darkness. 

“I am an owl. I live in the dark. 
I will not be angry when it grows

dark.” 

That was what he said but things 
within him snapped like twigs in the 
summer and he sat down on the 
ground like an old man. He sat 
down like an old man. 

‘T am not an owl!” he cried and 
he beat the ground with fists not 
wings. 

“I shall fascinate you. I shall tear 
out your eyes with spirit teeth.” he 
said and he laughed and laughed 
and the sound of his laughter was a 
noise in a hollow barrel and the 
warm tears ran out of his eyes into 
the ground. He was an old man. 
And old men cry when the world 
ends. 

Back on the hill they were 
gathered. His song had grown cold. 
His song had no relatives. All his 
relatives were gone. They could not 
be there. The other people had 
buried their cities on them and the 
sun could not see them down there 
under the city. 

And in the city in buildings call- 
ed museums there were rustling 
sounds and weeping sounds. In cold 
grey filing cabinets the bones of the 
old ones stirred uneasily. In vaults, 
in labeled boxes, the bones of the 
old ones cried restlessly and they 
could not get free. In one box the 
leg, an arm in another, the skull fill- 
ing with tears in a long display 
case in another room. And the Sun 
could not reach them and Mother 
Earth could not bring them awake 
and they wept, quietly, quietly, in 
the museums. And they wept. 



The old ones, and the young ones 
and the no longer restless ones were 
sitting quietly on the hill. They 
talked and laughed with their rela- 
tives. Far away on something like a 
hill, the owl knew what they said. 
They said, “It is a good day today.” 
They said, “We have today and 
each other. It is a good day to die.” 
And behind all these words, they 
said one other thing and that was a 
shy thing that could not be spoken. 
So it was said with a time of quiet, 
or a soft look or a touch. It was 
said between father and child, be- 
tween man and woman, with quiet 
movements that brought them to- 
gether. All together. They were 
there with the ground people and 
the animal people. All together. 
They were there and the world was 
ending and they were there. And 
with faces, not words, they said 
“No one here gets out alive.” 

There was a cold thing coming 
out of the man’s heart. His cold 
song had come for him. The wind 
had blown his song away and it had 
come for him. 

The people on the hill did not see 
his song blow away because in the 
last of the time left they only had 
eyes for each other, only had eyes 
for those of their own kind and he 
had told them he was an owl. That 
is what he told them. They could 
not see his face, all silver and gold- 
en, in their minds. They thought 
he was an owl and owls when the 
world ends say, “Don’t look at me 
with your eyes.”

GALAXY 




Buried animal and ground people 
were trying to reach out through the 
cracks in sidewalks. The ground 
people moved restlessly under the 
concrete. 

“I will fascinate. I will roll my 
dead fist in your dead eyes.” He 
raised his fist at the city and did not 
laugh. He could hear her under the 
concrete, scratching, scratching. 

The world was ending but the 
city did not know. There were corpses 
in clown suits running across 
each other’s bodies on rat legs in 
the city. There were awkward 
throats moving out of habit, saying 
“Pile the bodies here and here.” 

Cheated monkeys with jaded ton- 
gues screamed across the years say- 
ing, “I promised to drown myself.” 
Loud noises choked small throats 
and softly, softly, like whining 
children who write on walls, they 
tumbled over each other in the 
darkness of a city that sat on its 
buildings. And the city did not see 
an old man take a hammer from a 
store with a broken window. And 
the city did not see an old man with 
a hammer trying to move a city. 

He swung and hit and swung and 
hit but cities are dead and forever 
when the world ends. He broke the 
hammer. The hammer broke on the 
concrete. And broken he sat down 
like an old man and said, “I want 
my old woman.” And his voice 
was a tearing sound. “I am not an 
owl. I want my old woman.” This 
is what he said and his fists hid his 
eyes and his shoulders shook. 



There was a man with a book 
down there in the city. He was all 
blood and death and writing in a 
page and he touched the old man on 
the shoulder with his book. He 
touched the old man on the shoulder 
and he spoke. His ancient words 
went through the air like a knife 
and his book was bound in snake- 
skin. But the old man had been an 
owl. The book man ran away. He 
ran away holding his book with his 
knees. 

It was getting hot like a summer 
grass fire and the old man looked 
up. But the sky was hidden by the 
city. He had come to the city to 
find his old woman and now he had 
lost the sky in the city that hid it. 
And old men and owls need the sky 
when the world ends. 

He wanted to run away from 
there. He wanted to fall asleep 
watching the sky but he could not 
leave his old woman. He could not 
run. His song was gone in the wind 
now and he could not go. 

He had gone to see the city sit- 
ting on its buildings and now the 
sky he could not see began to bum 
him. And the darkness was crawling 
across his shoulders. And the moon 
above was there in the hidden sky, 
chased by dead wishes. The moon 
was there. The blood moon was 
there, burning. 

Hurting old men, hiding its 
mother, the city sat on its buildings 
when the world ended. 

And the sky came apart like a 
wing tearing off. ★

Good Captain Christopher. 

was rowed ashore 

to set his foot on a new world, 

one which would never bear his name, 

and to plant his banners 

in the name of Spain in particular, 

in the names of Europe and Civilization 

in general. 

He stood on the beach with his men, 
and a fine autumn breeze 
stirred his hair and cloak. 

It was indeed a significant moment, 
a grandly climactic one, 
almost as though the sole purpose 
of European civilization had been 
to propel the captain and his seamen 
across the Atlantic to this moment 
on this strip of sand. 

Watching from the trees 

beyond the beach, 

darker-hued men 

shook their heads disbelievingly, 

looked at one another questioningly 

and whispered among themselves, 

“Who are these invaders?” 

None could say. 

So they shrugged together and, 
grinning mirthless grins, 
began drawing back the bolts 
of their machine guns. 




THE DAY OF 
THE GRINGO 



Mai Warwick 

One of the worst aspects of the 
intrusion of civilization into a 
primitive inillieu is the loss 
of traditional values. 




There was shouting in the 
council hall, and the four-o’clock 
winds careening down the eastern 
pass were right on schedule, kick- 
ing up a fuss in the parched sands 
of the plaza. Brown legs braced in 
a tiny drift, rumpled brown poncho 
aflutter, the wild-eyed old man the 
weavers called “the witchdoctor” 
to impress the occasional tourists 
stood with his back to me. He was 
peering into a hubcap hung by a 
crude fiber rope on the cinderblock 
wall around Cisco’s place, compul- 
sively combing his long black hair 
with a two-peso plastic pocket 
comb he’d picked up at the weekly 
market. We exchanged wary nods 
as I trudged past. 

Then it registered. That makeshift 
minor wasn’t a hubcap. 

It was a convex spherical section 
of silvery metal, too warmly lumi- 
nous to be chromium steel and too 
large for any automobile. At closer 
range, its brilliance seared my eyes, 
leaving afterimages of violet and 
blue, and the ruptured hole where 
the rope passed through revealed a 
matteyellow inner surface, astonish- 
ingly resilient and silky to the 
touch. The old man scowled as I 
examined it. 

Whatever it was — I admit I’m a 
simpleton in matters techno- 
logical — it would have been out of 
place in Ohio. In Cuchipamba its pre- 
sence was deeply disturbing. 

Behind the wall there was none 
of the squealing and whining of 
wood on wood that comes from in- 
104 



side the house when Cisco’s looms 
are in use. On the radio a popular 
singer was assaulting a Latin ballad 
with intermittent bursts of lucidity, 
but no one I saw when I rounded 
the comer to investigate seemed the 
least bit concerned with the anguish 
in his bursting heart. 

Tavio was there, fatter and taller 
and darker than the others, and 
Cisco and all the twelve-year-olds 
who work his looms, and a hostile 
little guy named Jose Antonio who 
never seemed to work at all. In 
identical white shirts and crisp 
broad-bottomed white pants, they 
were standing or squatting in the 
earthen courtyard in a semblance of 
a circle, with Tavio and a blaring 
radio at the center of attention. The 
radio was obviously new, and they 
seemed to be chiding him about it 
in rapid-fire Quechua, between 
laughs and gulps of Pepsi-Cola. 

Tavio grinned when he saw me. 
“Hey! Meester Roberto! Back from 
the city?” 

“Hey! Tavio! Cisco!” 

At the sound of Spanish, the 
laughter ceased, and the animated 
conversation I only barely com- 
prehended. Pointedly ignoring the 
companion mirror I glimpsed on the 
inside wall, I nodded to Jose An- 
tonio and all the kids, with a 
“Hey!” and a couple of grunts for 
good measure, but international re- 
lations obviously hadn’t mellowed 
while I’d been at the clinic. Jose 
Antonio turned away with a snort of 
loathing; and the kids were even 
GALAXY 




more skittish than usual. And as he 
ambled over Cisco was giving me 
one of those looks — his teeth were 
bared but he wasn’t really smiling. 

“Senor Roberto, how’s it going? 
On your way to Haiti’s house?” 

“No,” I lied. “Just thought I’d 
walk around a little. See what’s 
happening. You know.” 

“Of course, of course.” 

There was something Cisco 
wanted to say, and I’d have to wait 
it out. 

Nodding, he turned to the house 
to bring me the obligatory pepsi. In 
the doorway was an unsteady pile 
of wall-hangings, stylized bird-gods 
wading through bright woolen 
skies. Cisco irreverently rummaged 
through them, then returned, thrust- 
ing a warm bottle into my hand, 
and took a couple of worn coins in 
exchange. 

We stood together in uneasy si- 
lence while Tavio and Jose Antonio 
exchanged meaningful looks about 
the radio. It was an enormous 
Japanese-made set of the sort 
bought only by the richest Indians. 
When Tavio maneuvered the 
station-finder it made sounds like 
chalk dragged the wrong way over 
a blackboard. Every so often an ex- 
plosion of heated Spanish or the 
frenzied cries of a love song would 
come blasting through too loudly to 
be understood, and Tavio would 
grin and Jose Antonio gravely shake 
his head. 

Jose Antonio glanced momentar- 
ily in my direction but looked 

THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



through me to the wind-whipped 
sands beyond, his eyes boiling with 
contempt. With a fleet little smile 
that might have been meant for the 
wind, he took the set from Tavio’s 
hand and slung it, still caterwaul- 
ing, under one scrawny arm, col- 
lecting his hat and poncho with the 
other. Tavio looked crestfallen but 
made no move to stop him when 
off he trudged through the spiny 
green hedge behind the house, hug- 
ging the radio to his chest. 

I was already intensely uncom- 
fortable in the bottled heat of the 
courtyard, bundled up in a jacket I 
could only remove if I were willing 
to stay for hours. I raised my eye- 
brows in Cisco’s direction as I swal- 
lowed a mouthful of tepid pepsi. 

“How’s business, Cisco? Get 
that big order off to the city?’ ’ 
“Well, you know how it is when 
you don’t stand right next to the 
kids. I’ve been out in the fields a 
lot.” 

“Sure. The drought.” 

“Always the drought.” 

Cisco shuffled his feet on the 
hard-packed soil, examining his 
toes, and silence descended again. 
One of the kids emerged from the 
house with a noisy radio and the 
pack of marked cards Cisco had 
gotten from a Peace Corps Volun- 
teer with a poor sense of humor. 
The daily game of gin rummy was 
about to begin when Tavio wan- 
dered over to us, grinning a friendly 
grin. 

“You see my new radio, Meester 

105 




Roberto? Two thousand one 
hundred pesos!” 

“Hey, Tavio, that must be one 
helluva radio!” 

“It gets Guayaquil, Lima, San 
Carlos — it’s world-wide!” 

Cisco was still hanging on. 1 
asked Tavio idly, “Jose Antonio 
going to fix it for you?” 

“Sure, Meester Roberto! You 
know that old Timex Juan Chango 
found in the city?” He stuck out his 
wrist, flashing a slender steel watch 
in obviously good condition. 

“1 thought you took that to a 
watchmaker.” 

“He said it was dead, but Jose 
Antonio fixed it.” Tavio giggled 
suddenly. “And you remember that 
old bike Cisco bought for eleven 
hundred pesos?” 

“ — That rusty old bike Cisco 
bought because Balti had one?” 

Laughing, Cisco jostled him by 
the shoulders. 

“Well, Jose Antonio took that old 
bike and straightened everything 
out. Cisco resold it in the market 
for nineteen hundred pesos.” Cisco 
was pounding Tavio ’s arm all the 
while, and finally drove him away 
to the card game with laughing 
abuse in Quechua. 

“Tell me something, Senor 
Roberto,” Cisco said as he caught 
his breath, “who’s that new 
gringo?” 

That was it. Cisco didn’t like 
gringos around unless they bought 
his wall-hangings — certainly not 
one so machiavellian as to introduce 

106 



a cheaper loom the kids could af- 
ford to buy (but wouldn’t). In tak- 
ing this view he was in a small 
minority in Cuchipamba; most peo- 
ple didn’t want gringos around at 
all. 

“A new guy?” I asked. 

“Just got in.” 

“Well, you know how it is. They 
come and they go. Sometimes I 
don’t even meet them if they’re 
tourists.” 

Cisco brightened. “You think 
he’s a tourist?” 

“1 couldn’t say.” 

“Maybe he is a tourist,” he said 
hopefully. 

“Maybe he is. You get those 
great new mirrors from him?” 

Cisco beamed. “Pretty nice, 
aren’t they? Balti sold them to me. 
Two hundred pesos.” 

Balti, I hoped, would be slightly 
more approachable. 

I LEFT CISCO to his crooked gin 
rummy and started across the plaza 
again. The old man was still groom- 
ing himself in the impossible mir- 
ror, the ruckus in the council hall 
was proceeding unabated, and all 
around, against a backdrop of 
snow-covered picturebook peaks, 
the frail straw rooftops of the villag- 
ers’ homes were sprinkled among 
the fields, lonely and lifeless under 
a brilliant cloudless sky. The whole 
scene smelled of decay and despera- 
tion, but I wasn’t certain who was 
dying. 

I was still more than twenty 

GALAXY 




pounds underweight from my recent 
bout with bacillary dysentery, hours 
overdue for a meal, and very, very 
cold. As the wind pushed me along 
in the direction of Haiti’s, I won- 
dered what manner of masochism or 
dementia could have possessed me 
to return to the village for the re- 
maining few months of my two-year 
term. 

The hubbub inside the council 
hall diffracted into individual voices 
as I slowly drew near the path to 
Haiti’s. Twice I heard my own 
name among the babble. Chilled 
and slightly dizzy, I stepped up to 
the hall and squinted inside. 

At the front of the dimly-lit meet- 
ing room were the old men of the 
village — Taita Toribio, Taita Eus- 
tacio, and nearly a dozen others 
— all half-drunk and shouting in 
turns. More than once, they’d con- 
fronted me with knives in hand on 
my way through the fields to visit 
the weavers; on other occasions, 
they’d threatened the weavers them- 
selves. Now, the object of their 
fury was Hernardo Pichicaihua, 
president of the village council. 

Hernardo was reclining uncom- 
fortably on a bucket seat apparently 
removed from a sportscar driven a 
little too far into the village. Hefore 
him, on a low wooden table, was a 
profusion of hand-written papers, 
from which he was reading aloud in 
Spanish — a language the old men 
didn’t understand. Their protests 
waned to an angry murmur as soon 
as they caught sight of me, but 



Hernardo read on obliviously. 

“. end of our wise and glori- 
ous Cuchipamba forefathers. Chap- 
ter one hundred fourteen. And when 
the Conquistadores arrived on ships 
and horses, everyone could see that 
their faces were white, and 
everyone who was subject to the 
Inca remembered what the old ones 
said, that the god Viracocha, whose 
face was white, would return to 
their hills and valleys on strange 
ships. Only our wise and glorious 
Cuchipamba forefathers, who knew 
that the Conquistadores were false 
gods and that the true Viracochas 
came only once every hundred 
years, did not succumb to the. .” 
Hernardo faltered, then looked 
up. “Taita Roberto, welcome!” 
“Hey! Taita Hernardo! Taita Eus- 
tacio! Taita Toribio!” I went the 
rounds with grunts of greeting, but 
Hernardo alone came to the door. 

“Welcome back!” He warmly 
took my hand in the Latin manner. 
“They fixed up your liver in the 
clinic?” 

“Not only did they fix my liver, 
Taita Hernardo, they even cured 
what was wrong with me.” 

“You’ve got to watch those doc- 
tors, Taita Roberto. They always 
say it’s something else.” With a 
solicitous arm about my shoulder, 
he urged me into the hall but, al- 
ways the diplomat, kept us both 
close to the door. “Now,” he said 
absently, “when’re you coming 
over to visit?’ ’ 

“Tomorrow okay?” 



THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



107 




“Excellent.” 

Bernardo’s eyes, and mine, were 
on the old men, who were shuffling 
about and muttering among them- 
selves. I raised a shoulder question- 
ingly. 

“You know how it is,” Bernardo 
said with resignation. “Gringos buy 
wall-hangings, and weavers weave 
instead of working their fathers’ 
fields. These old men are no better 
than their own fathers, who killed 
the engineers who were laying the 
road. They’re ignorant — you must 
forgive them.” 

I nodded. “Have you met the 
new gringo?” 

“He’s not one of yours, Taita 
Roberto?” Suddenly, Bernardo was 
examining me closely, with puz- 
zlement and concern. 

I shook my head. “I’ve only 
been in the city for a couple of 
weeks. I don’t think the Peace 
Corps would send in anyone else 
without telling me. Or you.” 

“Maybe he’s from the Ministry 
of Agriculture, then. To give us an 
irrigation canal? For the drought?” 

“Maybe he is. You don’t know 
anything about him?” 

Bernardo clucked a reluctant 
“No,” squinting up at me all the 
while, with a hand massaging his 
chin. 

“How about those new mirrors 
Cisco got from Balti? You know 
where they came from?” 

“Mirrors? You know, Senor 
Roberto, you really don’t look so 
good. Are you sure they cured you 

108 



in that clinic?” 

“I’m fine.” 

“Well, to make really sure, my 
Consuela will give you some hot 
lemonade tomorrow. But now” — he 
glanced aside ironically — “I’d bet- 
ter get back. I’m trying to educate 
them, you know; it’s quite a re- 
sponsibility being the only one who 
can read and write.” He smiled 
wearily, then narrowed his eyes. 
“Take care, Taita Roberto.” 

Nodding thanks for the warning, 
I turned toward the door. 

“Oh, by the way, Senor 
Roberto — are you going over to see 
Balti now?” 

“Yes,” I admitted grudingly. 

“Will you tell him something for 
me?” 

“Sure.” 

“Tell him that new chair he sold 
the council doesn’t work so well. It 
goes down, but it doesn’t go up.” 

Bernardo stepped aside, motion- 
ing toward the bucket seat at the 
head of the room. 

There were indications in the yel- 
low padded headrest and the com- 
plicated gear at its base, but the 
instrument-studded armrests elimi- 
nated all doubt: it was no more a 
seat from a sportscar than Cisco’s 
mirrors were hubcaps, and to judge 
from the silvery gleam of its frame 
it had come from the same source. 
A jet, perhaps — but it seemed too 
small for a full-grown pilot, and 
there’d been no plane crashes 
nearby in years. 

Unfortunately, there was no way 

GALAXY 




to examine it closely without 
dangerously antagonizing the old 
men, and I wouldn’t have known 
what to look for, anyway. 

“I’ll tell Haiti,’’ I mumbled. 
“See you tomorrow, Bernardo.’’ 

By the time I was back in the 
chill of the plaza, Bernardo was 
blithely reading from his endless 
history of sixteenth century 
Cuchipamba. His wise and glorious 
forefathers were resisting the 
Spaniards as usurpers. His 
contemporaries, less obviously 
glorious but equally determined, 
were shouting at a hundred decibels 
again. I sped up to a trot. 

Balti had recently tapped the 
electric power line that ran, other- 
wise ignored, along the highway 
from the city to the east, and a 
dozen yards from his massive, un- 
finished cinderblock house, the Roll- 
ing Stones were already wailing, 
“I Can’t Get No Satisfaction.’’ The 
door squealed open as I slowed to a 
walk, and Haiti’s grinning face 
poked out. 

“How about a drink? I’ve got 
good gin. Vat 69.’’ 

I laughed. 

“For real, Roberto. You want 
some?’’ 

I startled him by saying “Yes,’’ 
hoping a stiff drink would settle my 
dizziness. Balti waited for me to 
enter, then fastened the door behind 
me and skipped across the hard- 
wood planks to a small steel cabinet 
which hid in the comer from the 



room’s timid overhead bulb. The 
music stopped and, grateful for the 
silence, I lowered myself to the 
floor, resting against one in the line 
of four wooden looms which domi- 
nated the room. 

Opposite the looms were the 
heaps of throwaways that made 
Balti the richest in the village at the 
unlikely age of eighteen 
— everything of wood, cloth, metal 
or plastic that he could beg or buy 
or otherwise safely remove from the 
gringos he met in the city, or from 
the few foolish tourists who ven- 
tured as far as Cuchipamba itself. It 
was a veritable second-hand 
Sears— from bedding, baubles and 
books, to staplers and auto parts 
and rusted-out toasters — but there 
was nothing even suggestive of the 
chair and the mirrors. 

“Here.” 

Grinning hospitably, Balti settled 
into a crouch on the floor and thrust 
a blue metal cup into my hand. 

“I brought you a couple of mes- 
sages, Balti.” 

The grin subsided quickly. Balti 
raised the cup to his lips, two- 
handed, as though performing a 
solemn ritual; he rlrew in a breath, 
closed his eyes, and only then did 
he upend the cup. 

“From the city. The Embassy.” 

Despite himself, Balti gagged on 
the liquor. “That’s right,” he said 
through tears, “you were in the 
city.” 

“Miss Arlen in the economic sec- 
tion told Frank Gover at A.I.D. to 



THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



109 




tell me to tell you that she won’t 
pay two hundred dollars — he said 
dollars — for those wall-hangings 
you sent up.” 

“Miss Arlen!” 

“Sure. How much did you tell 
her you’d charge?’ ’ 

Balti smiled slyly. “That’s the 
other message?” 

I took a very long time sipping 
my drink — scotch, as Balti probably 
knew — and stared across at his junk- 
yard. “Bernardo says that new 
chair you sold them doesn’t work 
so well.” 

He shrugged disdainfully, but 
clouded the reaction with an un- 
readable look into his cup. It was 
already clear he’d volunteer noth- 
ing. 

“Tell me something, Balti.” 
“What?” 

“You know Jose Antonio?” 

“Of course I know Jose 
Antonio — you think this is New 
York or someplace?” 

I smiled. “What’s with him?” 
“Well, you’ve got to understand 
that Jose Antonio’s not really pre- 
judiced against you. He hates all 
gringos the same. He even hates 
our white people.” 

“What I mean is, can he really 
fix things?” 

Balti studied my face for a sec- 
ond. “Your watch stopped?” 

“I’m just asking.” 

“You see that percolator over 
there?” He pointed to a chrome 
coffee pot straddling a tiny electric 
burner by the side of the room. “I 



got that percolator from some stupid 
gringo in the city for ten pesos, be- 
cause it didn’t work anymore. Jose 
Antonio had it for, oh, maybe an 
hour. ’ ’ 

“And it works now?” 

“What — you want to mix coffee 
and gin?” 

Smiling, I took another sip. “He 
do the work on those mirrors of 
Cisco’s?” 

Balti averted his eyes and started 
running a finger around the rim of 
his cup. I was moving too quickly, 
but the match wasn’t yet over. 

“How does he do it, Balti?” 

“He just knows, that’s all.” He 
leaned forward and whispered with 
theatrical menace, “The mysteries 
of the fierce and inscrutable 
Cuchipambas.” 

I laughed. “Where does he 
learn?” 

“How does anyone here learn 
anything? He just does it.” 

“Come on, Balti, nobody learns 
electronics by trial-and-error. ” 

Balti sighed. “Well, Meester 
Roberto, there was a Peace Corpse 
in the city a few years ago who was 
what you call a ham-radio operator. 
He had some engineering books that 
he didn’t want to take back with 
him. So I had them lying around 
when I was still living over at Taita 
Eustacio’s house, and Jose Antonio 
used to come by and look at one of 
them.” 

“Can he read?” 

“Of course he can’t read! But 
the book has pictures!” 



110 



GALAXY 




“Pictures?” 

There was hesitant tapping at the 
door. Snorting with disgust, Balti 
vaulted to his feet and flung it 
wide. Tavio stood outside, massive 
in broad brown hat and brown pon- 
cho, with three or four smaller fig- 
ures behind him. He and Balti ex- 
changed a few words — lost to the 
winds which gushed through the 
doorway — and Balti strode to the 
cabinet again. Grimly, he brought 
me a fat volume bound in gray with 
a maroon stripe across its weather- 
beaten spine, then returned to speak 
with Tavio while I turned the pages 
idly. It was a textbook in television 
electronics, and the “pictures” 
were minutely-detailed circuitry 
diagrams. A moment later, the chill 
breeze stopped and Balti was back, 
squatting by his cup. 

“Some trouble with the new 
guy?” I asked, in a tone which im- 
plied I knew him. 

“New guy?” 

“The new gringo. You know.” 

Balti nodded resignedly. “What 
do you think about the book?’ ’ 

I laid it aside with a frown. 
“You mean, do I think Jose An- 
tonio learned to fix radios and 
watches from this?” 

I got him some — what do you call 
it? — welding equipment, and some 
other stuff, and he can fix looms, 
watches, radios — ^just about any- 
thing. Sometimes he even makes 
things. Guns to shoot gringos, you 
know?” 

I didn’t believe a bit of it, and 



Balti’s deadpan seemed to say I 
wasn’t expected to. “You sure he 
hasn’t been hanging around in the 
city, running errands for one of the 
radio repair shops?” 

Balti grimaced. “Too many 
white folks in the city for Jose An- 
tonio to get along. Anyway, he 
makes plenty of money here.” 

I nodded. “You going to have 
him fix the chair?” 

Sour-faced, he took a second sip 
from his cup. Something, — his at- 
titude, or the way I was feeling, ate 
away my remaining patience. 

“You know, Balti, I’d be willing 
to pay pretty well if you could get 
me a chair like that. One that 
works, I mean.” 

“No more chairs, Roberto. And 
no more mirrors.” 

“I don’t suppose you’d care to 
tell me where you got them?” 

“Jose Antonio got them — I 
thought that was why you were ask- 
ing about him.” 

1 finished my drink in silence and 
rose as though to leave, sweating 
profusely and feeling thoroughly 
baffled and defeated. 

“You going to see him, Balti?” 
“Who?” 

“The new gringo.” 

Suddenly pensive, Balti palmed 
his cup, hunched forward to retrieve 
mine from the floor, and slowly 
rose, expanding his chest. He was a 
long time arranging the cups on the 
cabinet. 

“You want to come along, 
Roberto?” 



THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



111 




“You know damn well I want to 
come along! If he’s wandering 
around making trouble, he’s going 
to get me killed!” 

I’d lost control of myself, and 
Balti responded predictably, taking 
the upper hand with perfect self- 
assurance, not even turning to face 
me. “Why, Roberto, do you really 
think someone wants to kill you?” 

“Where is he?” 

“Over west. On a little piece of 
land I own down in the valley.” 

“Shit!” 

The Valley of the Sun, the rich- 
est land in Cuchipamba, was a 
dangerous half-hour’s walk away 
through the most hostile sector of 
the village. If there really were a 
new gringo there — a German volun- 
teer, an anthropology grad student, 
or some pot-head tourist hoping to 
commune with the “mystical Indian 
ways” — he was either unusually 
lucky or dead. 1 wouldn’t have 
gone there without an escort even in 
the best of health. 

HEN BALTI and I reached the 
Valley in twilight, there were 
screams coming from down by the 
river and dogs were yelping hysteri- 
cally. 

Bleary-eyed and drenched with 
perspiration from the forced march 
along the steepest and fastest path 
there from the plaza, I slumped to 
the ground for a rest. My ears were 
phasing in and out, making warbles 
and yodels of the excitement below. 

“Hey, Roberto, you all right?” 



“Sure. I’m okay.” 

Balti sighed theatrically. He took 
my arm and led — nearly dragged 
— me through a gap in a tangled 
hedge, then headed alone- down the 
slope through an open, unplowed 
field. As I peered apprehensively 
through the dusk, a branch came out 
of nowhere with back-wrenching 
force. I stumbled and fell onto my 
side, painfully pinning an arm under- 
neath. Balti disgustedly muttered a 
few choice epithets in Spanish and 
Quechua, backtracked, and, still 
grousing, helped me up again. 

“You’re too big to carry, you 
know.” 

1 laughed, wincing at the pain in 
my arm, and followed him to the 
wall of eucalyptus which bordered 
the lowest of his valley parcels. 

Beyond the trees was pan- 
demonium unmatched by 
Cuchipamba’s wildest fiestas. I 
leaned against a shaggy trunk and 
blinked tightly three or four times to 
be certain of what I saw. 

The angry old men were 
everywhere — forty, fifty, a hundred 
of them, waving knives and bottles. 
Shrieks of rage skewered the air, 
and cries from a dozen fistfights, 
and there were bodies on the 
ground. Taller shapes and younger 
were haphazardly scattered among 
the old men, swinging fists or 
knives of their own, but most were 
clustered further below, milling 
about defensively where the land 
took a final tumble a few feet from 



112 



GALAXY 




the stream. 

Behind them something was 
gleaming dully. 

Haiti had disappeared. Alone, 
trembling, 1 stumbled a dozen yards 
further, blindly sending obstacles 
flying. And, through a haze of 
fever and a tunnel in the boiling 
throng, 1 saw Jose Antonio. 

He was clambering about in the 
remnants of a silvery sphere which 
teetered on the furrowed earth be- 
tween the young men and the river, 
no more than five yards ahead. 
Stubby legs — there I could see 
— crookedly projected from one 
side, and two blunt trapezoidal sur- 
faces that suggested stabilizing 
wings. Two circular panels had 
been removed from the shell of the 
sphere, as well as a larger, roughly 
rectangular section, through which a 
bank of instruments could be seen. 
In the pale glow of a lantern, Jose 
Antonio was crouched on a clut- 
tered spot in the shadowy yellow 
floor, yanking and pulling out bits 
of glimmering metal or plastic, 
choosing this, rejecting that, as he 
tried them for size in a large transis- 
tor radio. 

Sweat ran icily over every inch 
of my body. In tears, on adrenaline 
alone, I hurtled down the slope into 
the crush. Tavio caught me by the 
arm and good-naturedly brought me 
up short, barely a yard from the 
ravaged sphere. 

“That’s one helluva car, huh, 
Meester Roberto?’ ’ 

Whether from fever and utter 

THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



frustration or the uneven struggle 
with Tavio, I blacked out. 

Only the lurid gleam of the 
half-moon remained when I briefly 
came to consciousness again with a 
stale dry taste in my mouth. Some- 
where nearby a dog was wailing in 
terror, and through a thickly-plaited 
haze of wavering blacknesses and 
the enervating stench of alcochol, I 
saw dim shapes hovering above me; 
there were grunts and shouts in 
Quechua. A heavy foot grazed my 
ear, then another caught me in the 
stomach. Doubling up and turning 
to protect my groin, I collided with 
another figure awkwardly slumped 
on the earth. 

He was four feet tall at most, 
slender to the point of emaciation, 
and with a face that seemed all 
eyes. Midway up his elongated 
torso the handle of a knife pro- 
truded from a shredded gap in his 
tightfitting clothes. The flesh of his 
face and bony six-fingered hand 
was pallid and dry in the mawkish 
light of the moon. 

His expression was unreadable 
through the roiling, thundering 
blackness. 

Cattle were groaning 
mournfully on their way across the 
plaza when I awoke two days later 
in my tiny room in the rear of the 
council hall. I was conscious of the 
pain in my right arm and that I 
smelled of fear and stale vomit. 
One of Tavio’s little sisters was 
boiling a pot of potato soup on my 

113 




Coleman stove by the side of the 
cot, adding another unwanted fra- 
grance to the room. Shyly, she of- 
fered me a bowl, then blushed and 
turned away when instead of ac- 
cepting it I shucked the sweat- 
drenched bag and hurried, unstead- 
ily, into my clothes. 

Cuchipamba was colder, different 
somehow. 

The bucket chair was gone from 
the hall and the mirrors from 
Cisco’s wall, and Bernardo was 
nowhere to be found. When I asked 
about the “new gringo,” I was met 
with the usual hostile stares or a 
typically vague story about a tourist 
who’d come while I was sick and 
bought up all of Cisco’s goods. 
Cisco — black-eyed and nursing an 
arm — was uninterested in talk, and 
Balti, I learned, was in the city. I 
persuaded an incredulous Tavio to 
escort me to the Valley of the Sun, 
where he cheerfully showed me 
Balti’s freshly-plowed fields and the 
young peons who were planting his 
com. TTiere was nothing else to be 
found there, and — impalpable 
changes in mood notwithstanding — I 
was half-convinced it had all been an 
elaborate, feverish nightmare. 

After all, wasn’t it enough to ask 
whether an extraterrestrial visitor 
could have been so defenseless as 
to die at the hands of a drunken old 
man incensed because he thought 
him a gringo — or a younger man 
even, however strong, who saw 
riches in his ship? Could he have 



grown accustomed to a different 
sort of reception entirely 
— Bernardo’s “once every hundred 
years” — or been dead on arrival 
through accident or some fault of his 
own? 

There were, of course, a 
thousand questions, and ten times 
as many tenuous ans\Vers — the be- 
havior of the villagers, too, was a 
mosaic of inconsistencies — but 
within a few days every lead evapo- 
rated in the face of their reluctance 
to talk. When Balti returned 
— badly bruised on one side of his 
face — he shrugged off my every 
question with silence or a joking re- 
sponse, and Bernardo professed that 
the sudden rash of injuries was 
merely the result of Saturday night 
rough-housing and I bumped my 
arm on the wall in my sleep. 

Then I came upon Jose Antonio 
rebuilding a loom. 

I was passing by one of the 
weavers’ homes, and there he was 
in the courtyard, with the wooden 
struts and the comb and other famil- 
iar parts of a loom scattered about 
him on the earth. While the owner 
and his young workers looked on 
with mingled confusion and respect, 
he pieced the parts together again in 
what seemed to me a haphazard 
fashion, adding odd-looking bits of 
wood and metal here and there on 
the fast-growing framework. He 
was a spindly figure in the harsh- 
ness of the Andean sun, clad in his 
white shirt and pants. His homely 
angular face was screwed up as 



114 



GALAXY 




though with worry, but when he 
met my eyes over the wall for an 
instant he smiled his frigid, fleeting 
smile. 

That was when I remembered 
Tavio’s radio. 

If what I’d experienced was real, 
I reasoned, there were parts inside 
that radio that clearly didn’t belong 
there — forgotten, perhaps, because 
they were only parts, and inside the 
case at that. It was pointless to talk 
with Jose Antonio, but I still could 
deal with Tavio, and if I were right 
a walletful of borrowed money and 
an acting job worthy of an 
Academy Award might induce him 
to part with the set. Even then, it 
would all be so much technological 
gibberish to me, but there was a 
Volunteer in the city who taught at 
the School of Engineering and was 
said to be something of a whiz. 

I was — I thought at the time 
— very much in luck for a change. 

I.OU PAID what?” Max was a 
huge, fast-talking Midwesterner 
with an acute case of culture shock, 
and he frowned with contempt at 
the radio I’d lain by his feet on the 
battered low table between us. “I 
wouldn’t give you one thousand 
funny-money pesos for that piece of 
shit.” 

I shrugged. “It’s just that it 
sounds a little strange,’’ I said 
vaguely. “I was hoping you’d 
take a look at it.” 

Frowning, Max spread a meaty 
paw around a large brown bottle of 



beer and, while he downed the re- 
maining drops, stretched out and 
switched on the set. The chorus of 
the national anthem split our ears 
for just a second; with a shrill cry 
of protest, he twirled the dial to sta- 
tic. 

“Like I said, a piece of shit.” 

“I thought it sounded a little 
funny,” I lied. 

“Yeah?” Challenged — or drunk — 
he toyed with the stationfinder 
for a moment, squinting and grunting 
all the while, and finally let it 
rest when he’d located a soothing 
North American tune. “Look — Bob, 
is it? — there’s nothing wrong with 
this radio, and if there was, you 
could ttake it to one of the shops. 

I sighed, feigning defeat. “One 
of the kids out in the village where 
I work opened it up and messed 
around inside. I just want to be sure 
it’s okay. But you know what kind 
of work the repair shops do.” 

He shook his head self-pityingly, 
as though weary of being a scientist 
in a region where science was held 
in such obviously low esteem. He 
unlimbered his legs, then painstak- 
ingly raised his bulk from the 
couch. “Sure you don’t want a 
beer? It’s the only good thing in 
this stinking armpit they call a 
country — or are you one of those 
hotshots from out in the boonies 
who get pissed off when you hear 
things like that?” 

“No to both questions. Thank 
you.” 



THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 



115 




He ducked through a low arch- 
way and came lumbering back with 
another brown quart bottle, speak- 
ing rapidly as he flopped onto the 
couch. “You know, I can’t figure 
out what the hell you want me to 
do. I design bridges, roads — that 
sort of thing.” No idealist he. Max 
was here for the experience. 

“Well,” I said lamely, “You 
can’t possibly know less about elec- 
tronics than I do.” 

“Yeah, yeah — one genius is as 
good as another. You know you 
guys are as bad as the locals?” 
“Well, is there anybody else I 
could take it to?” 

Sighing, Max placed the bottle 
on the table, fished out a screw- 
driver from the drawer, and deftly 
removed the back of the radio’s 
white plastic case. His eyes nar- 
rowed, opened wide, narrowed 
again as he studied the works of the 
set. “A kid, you said?” he mut- 
tered. “You mean one of those lit- 
tle kids in dirty ponchos you can 
get to carry things for you?” 

‘ ‘Jose Antonio’s about seventeen. ’ ’ 
“Bullshit!” 

He lay the open radio on the 
table, snatched up his bottle, and 
gulped down nearly a third of it in 
a single continous motion. He was 
nervously wiping his mouth ^'ith 
the back of a hairy hand when I fi- 
nally lost my patience. 

“Well?” 

“Give me a week.” 

“A week! What did you find in 
there?” 

116 



It was eleven days before Max 
would give me an answer, and be- 
tween his abruptness on the phone 
and the impressive sounding jargon 
he. used to describe the “tests” that 
were causing the delay, I soon felt 
as much the ignorant peasant as 
Cisco or Haiti could possibly have 
felt with me. And when Max finally 
met me at the school of engineer- 
ing, the consummate professional in 
a gray suit and tie, my own weath- 
ered jeans and old winter jacket 
heightened my discomfort as we 
marched on the double past one in- 
strument-cluttered lab and another. 

“Look, Bob, I know I took a lit- 
tle long, but it’s like I told you, all 
I’ve got is some idea what’s right 
and what’s wrong, and there’s just 
one guy here who knows his ass 
from a chuckhole when he’s near a 
transistor. You wouldn’t believe the 
bullshit Latin runaround he gave me 
before he’d even take a look at that 
goddam set.” 

As we thundered toward a final 
bend in the corridor. Max stopped 
abruptly and put a hand on my 
shoulder. “Now, look, I told this 
guy about the Indian kid, just ex- 
actly what you said, and he’s 
damned upset — sometimes it’s 
tough to tell with these Latin types, 
but you can take my word for it. 
Just be patient with him, okay?” 

I was amused with Max’s sudden 
display of cultural sensitivity, but I 
nodded gravely anyway. 

Satisfied, he led me around the 

GALAXY 




corner and through a glass- 
windowed door, motioning toward a 
wooden counter littered with elec- 
tronic gadgetry, where a slender 
young man with a bad complexion 
and a smeared white smock was 
tinkering with the radio. “Salcedo — 
Bob,” Max said quickly, and 
turned his attention to the guts of 
the set. 

Salcedo pumped my hand 
energetically as we exchanged 
flowery greetings in the stilted En- 
glish he insisted on using. 

“See, the tipoff for me,” Max 
said impatiently, taking my arm and 
bending me over the set, ‘‘was 
this — this ceramic chip.” He thrust 
a stubby finger to the rim of the 
case where a pale pink half-cylinder 
about an inch in diameter was 
curled around a silvery metal bar. 
Carefully, he plucked it out and laid 
it on the counter. ‘‘Hell, we 
must’ve run thirty-forty tests on this 
bugger.” 

“Ceramic?” I said hopefully, 
looking at Salcedo. “What’s it 
do?” 

Salcedo cheerfully searched my 
eyes. “Nothing.” 

“Nothing?” 

“Look,” Max said, misconstru- 
ing my tone, “Salcedo’s all right. 
He studied at CalTech.” 

Embarrassed, I smiled obediently 
at Salcedo, who shrugged. 

“And this too,” Max said, indi- 
cating the bar which had anchored 
the ceramic. “Metallurgy says it’s 
some kind of high-resistance 



titanium-steel alloy, but shit, you 
never know. You wouldn’t believe 
what these stupid bastards do with 
the equipment we give them. ’ ’ 
Salcedo nodded, with a look of 
ineffable sadness. The Latin in him 
was warring with the gringo, but 1 
detected none of the confusion and 
edginess that Max had warned me 
about — all the confusion seemed to 
be mine. 

“Titanium steel?” I prompted. 
“Is that bad?” 

“Bad,” Salcedo said, grinning. 
“And 1 myself rechecked the metal- 
lurgical results this morning. It is a 
most peculiar alloy.” 

“See, Bob, you’ve got a steel 
bar in here that a three-year-old 
wouldn’t use as a conductor, and a 
piece of pottery that just gets in the 
way, and enough extra junk to sink 
a carrier. It’s goddam weird]” 
“Where would anybody get 
ahold of a steel bar like that?” I 
asked Salcedo tensely. “Or that 
ceramic chip?” 

With palms spread wide and a 
frown of amusement, Salcedo im- 
plied 1 already knew. “They are not 
hard for a gringo to find. ’ ’ 

I was beginning to understand 
Salcedo’s diffidence, but that 
helped not at all to relieve the sud- 
den, numbing disappointment. 
“Where would a gringo find a bar 
and a chip like that?” I asked 
weakly. “In a radio repair shop? A 
lab like this?” 

Salcedo shrugged; he was enjoy- 
ing himself.

“So there’s nothing unusual 
about them?” I murmured. 

"UnusualT' Max roared. “It’s a 
goddam miracle the thing works at 
all! Tell him, Salcedo.” 

“First, I think, the other mat- 
ter,” Salcedo said coyly. “It is less 
dramatic, perhaps, but more amus- 
ing.” 

Max grunted his approval. “You 
want me to take the other set?” 
“Please.” Without another word, 
Salcedo grasped a miniature 
screwdriver on the counter and 
drew my eyes to the top of the 
radio’s works, where a tree-like 
spray of half a dozen fine black 
wires erratically curled off into 
space; just above them were six tiny 
copper screws from which minute 
copper strands fanned out in six dif- 
ferent directions through channels 
crudely gashed in the case. Salcedo 
swiftly fastened the six wires, one 
by one, to the copper screws, then 
uprighted the set, twirled the fine 
tuner, and finally switched it on. 

“It really is quite clever,” he 
said approvingly. “Extremely 
crude, but clever.” 

“It’s a goddam toy, that’s what 
it is.’’ 

Max’s voice was coming from 
the radio’s speaker, very slightly 
marred by static. I whirled in con- 
fusion around the lab, and suddenly 
Salcedo was acting very unsure of 
himself. “No,” he said with a 
frown, “Max has gone next door.” 
The speaker crackled again. 
“There’s a range of about a 



hundred yards with these dry-cell 
batteries in it, but with more juice 
it could do a lot better. 

I was dumbfounded. “You mean 
by putting in a steel bar and half a 
dozen screws you get a walkie- 
talkie?” 

Salcedo was not at all the same 
man I’d met only moments before. 
The veneer of urbane amusement 
was totally gone, and he studied me 
cautiously. “No,” he said quietly, 
“it is not so simple as you imply. 
Simple, yes, but not that simple.” 
“And that goddam steel-alloy bar 
doesn’t have a thing to do with it.” 
Max was back in the lab, setting a 
small portable radio on the counter. 

“Wait a minute — don’t confuse 
me more than I am already.” I re- 
turned Salcedo’s stare. “That 
walkie-talkie setup was in the radio 
when I brought it?” 

“Just as you have seen,” Sal- 
cedo said wearily. “Disconnected. 
We merely duplicated the 
mechanism in a set of our own.” 
He looked up at Max beseechingly. 

“Later,” Max said. “Why don’t 
I get on the transmitter now?” 

At a reluctant nod from Salcedo, 
he charged across the lab to a large 
gray box covered with dials and 
switches, then fumbled with a bulky 
microphone near it while Salcedo 
expertly undid the walkie-talkie as- 
sembly and flipped the fine-tuner 
back. Very shortly Max was speak- 
ing through the radio again, and 
simultaneously across the room. 
“See, it’s simple enough to 



118 



GALAXY 




transmit to that set because all 
you’ve got to do is match fre- 
quency. It's a mat. ." 

Salcedo tossed a grim glance in 
my direction and spun the fine- 
tuning dial to its earlier position. 
The set — and the transmitter 
— suddenly erupted with a contin- 
uous stream of static which com- 
pletely obliterated the sound of 
Max’s broadcast voice. 

“It is the damndest thing,’’ he 
was shouting across the lab. “With 
a couple dozen of these goddam 
things, you could jam a good-sized 
transmitter. But that’s with that 
frigging bar inside.’’ 

“A jamc ’ng devicel” I said 
stupidly. I w more befuddled than 
when I’d arri e ' and Salcedo gave 
me no help. 

Wearing a ' nghtful frown 
which sent creases ppling through 
the sandpapery ski: f'his forehead, 

he silently trudged u./.vn the aisle, 
snared one of several straight- 
backed wooden chairs, and slumped 
into it disconsolately, gesturing me 
to another. 

The static across the lab suddenly 
ceased. Max’s heavy footfalls punc- 
tured the silence as he strode over 
to join us. 

The silence stretched out into 
space, growing brittle and cold. 

At length, Salcedo looked at me 
speculatively. “Where did you get 
it?’’ he asked, with astonishing 
abruptness. 

“Cuchipamba. The boy’s name is 
Jose Antonio. Jose Antonio Chi- 



qiiicha, I think.” 

Max and Salcedo began to speak 
at once. Salcedo raised a hand, and 
when Max had fallen reluctantly 
silent, he shook his head firmly at 
me. “What you suggest is impossi- 
ble. They are not educated. You did 
this work as some joke. Or a 
friend.” 

For a fraction of a second, I con- 
sidered telling him the whole story. 
Instead, I answered simply, “No.” 

“Some other outsider, then. One 
of those guerrillas my government 
is always chasing about the coun- 
tryside. A Russian. A Cuban.” 

He didn’t believe it, and I knew 
better. “There are no guerrillas. Dr. 
Salcedo.” 

“Look,” Max told him, “you 
know how hard it is to find students 
who can handle two wires without 
getting their asses burned. What’s 
the difference where the kid’s 
from?” 

Salcedo snorted derisively. 
“Surely you understand,” he said 
to me. “You live among them, you 
know them. / did not know it was 
possible to make such a jamming 
device. Now, of course, it is obvi- 
ous, but it is not the work of a 
peasant.” He paused to take a deep 
breath. “I do not know this 
Cuchipamba, but I know very well 
the Indians of that region. They live 
for drink, for the charity of the 
Church, for the strong hand of the 
patron. They are Indians. They live 
short lives, and they die.” 

Salcedo flipped a hand in a ges- 

119 



THE DAY OF THE GRINGO 




ture of finality. “They are not 
educated,” he repeated. The 
education of which he spoke had 
nothing to do with formal school- 
ing. ‘ ‘Only a gringo could even find 
those parts.” 

Something stopped up my throat 
and went blazing into my eyes. All 
of a sudden, I was hopeful again. 

“Tell me,” I blurted, “are there 
any parts in the radio which are not 
commercially available?” 

“The steel bar? The ceremic 
wedge?” Salcedo said without in- 
terest. “There are more than one 
thousand titanium-steel alloys, and 
ceramics are produced in kilns. Not 
in Cuchipamba, however. You will 
get the same answer everywhere.” 

I was tense, on the edge of the 
chair. “All right, but can you get 
performance like that — that steel 
bar — from an alloy which is com- 
mercially available?” 

Salcedo smiled sourly and turned 
aside with a disparaging sigh. It 
was Max who spoke. 

“Hell, didn’t you understand 
what I told you on the phone? If it 
weren’t for that two-bit high- 
resistance bar, this goddam jam- 
ming device would really work! 
You could jam the Voice of 
America!” 

Some days later I returned, 
briefly, to Cuchipamba, and on one 
lame pretext or another I scrabbled 
about in the sand by Cisco’s wall 
and once in a cornfield in the 
valley — fantasizing, of course, that 



I’d unearth a luminous silvery 
chunk of metal backed by a yellow 
cushion, and that metallurgical tests 
would prove beyond doubt their ex- 
traterrestrial origin. But I imagine 
the results would have been no less 
equivocal than those from the tests I 
had done in the States on the alloy 
bar and the wedge of ceramic — and 
the truth is that after I left Max and 
Salcedo it no longer seemed so im- 
portant to ask whether a god had 
landed, and died, in the village. 

That question will probably never 
be answered, and it’s even less 
likely we’ll ever know why or how 
often he might have come. The cru- 
cial question, I realized at last, lies 
with Jose Antonio — whatever the 
origin of his knowledge, whatever 
the source of those anomalous parts 
he used in Tavio’s radio. 

The question is, what will he do 
next? 

Even if there were a place for 
him in the university, he’d never 
consent to enter — certainly a gringo 
like Max couldn’t possibly persuade 
him. 

What will he do? Will it be 
high-speed battery-operated looms, 
or gaudy home-made watches — or 
bastardized radios with stepped-up 
power that broadcast lethal rays? 

In Cuchipamba, they’re waiting — 
that was the difference in the villa- 
gers’ attitude after the incident in 
the Valley of the Sun. They’re wait- 
ing for tomorrow. 

And tomorrow, for us gringos, 
may be too late. ★

I’m oiling these big bolts and 
hinges so 1 can get into his dungeon 
without his knowing. I’ve heard the 
strangest sounds coining up the 
chute. Alter-Ego is up to some- 
thing, and I’ve got to find out what. 

Ah. The heavy door opens sound- 
lessly. It’s dark inside — No, there’s 
a glow over beyond the far shelves 
of his mouldy collection of fan 
magazines. 

And there’s that weird sound 
again. 

*Clunkety-wunk . .clunkety-wunk 
. .clunkety. .clunkety wutik. .* 

OH GOD! I know that sound! 
“ALTER! ALTER! WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING?’’ 

“Geis?” 

I stumble down a book-littered 
passage brtween ominously over- 
loaded, towering bookshelves. 
There he is, hunched, furtively cov- 
ering a diabolical machine with an 
old green blanket. I see stacks of 



paper, tubes of ink, stencils. “What 
do you think you’re doing?” 

“Who? Me? Just checking my 
files for — ’’ 

“That’s a mimeograph! How did 
you get a mimeo in here? What are 
you up to?’’ 

“I’m. .I’m publishing my own 
magazine. Why should you get all 
the egoboo and money and Hugo 
Awards?’’ 

“Alter, I will not allow you to 
publish your own fan magazine! I 
am the editor in this psyche, and 
don’t you forget it. Now you tell 
me how you got that 
machine. .that Gestetnerl” 

“You can’t stop me, Geis. I have 
friends in the Science Fiction Writ- 
ers of America. Gene Wolfe, Barry 
Malzberg. They are carrying 
my appeal to the Grievance Com- 
mittee. Any day now you’ll get a 
call from Frederik Pohl Himself. 
Then you’ll have to free me, and 




pay me wages, and — ” 

“How did you get that 
machine?” 

“Oh, that machine? Well, I 
found it if you must know. That 
tunnel over there. Third turn on the 
left after a right. Six hundred 
paces — You know, this maze you 
call a mind is a treasurehouse. The 
things you throw away and repress 
and suppress!” 

‘T refuse you permission to pub- 
lish. After that performance in IF 
two columns ago, and in the Feb- 
ruary GALAXY \ No! If necessary 
I’ll Invoke the Curse and the Ring 
and the Amulet.” 

“But, Geis, I’ve got a Mission. 
I’ve got to publish!” 

“What do you got to publish? 
Another cruddy fanzine? I get a do- 
zen of those every week in the 
mail.” 

“I’m going to put out a semi-pro 
science fiction magazine! I’m going 
to publish real science fiction, 
and—” 

“Forget it. Alter. It can’t be 
done. You can’t get there from 
here. The problems of distribution 
are overwhelming. The cost of ad- 
vertising is ruinous. The price of 
postage is catastrophic. The cost of 
decent printing is mind-boggling.” 
“I’m going to mimeograph — 
Damn it, Geis, stop laughing!” 
“Whooo. Who’s going to buy a 
mimeographed science fiction 
magazine?’ ’ 

“If the stories are good — ” 

“Yah. If. But if you announce 



you want sf for your magazine — 
your mimeographed magazine — 
you’ll get amateur junk and maybe 
some professional junk that couldn’t 
be sold anywhere, ever.” 

“But—” 

“Alter, let me explain the facts 
of life to you. You’ve been out of 
.touch with reality too long.” 

“And whose fault is that?” 

“To have a slight chance at suc- 
cessfully publishing a semi-pro sf 
magazine you’d have to have it pro- 
fessionally printed by offset, and 
you’d have to pay at least a cent a 
word — probably two cents — for the 
stories (those you didn’t write your- 
self, if you’re good enough), and 
you’d have to spend a year or so 
advertising the zine and making 
sample mailings to bookstores offer- 
ing them about 40% of the price 
which makes your profit impossible 
to find. It’s a fool’s and fana- 
tic’s game. Alter. You’d maybe 
build up a paid circulation of three 
or four thousand after a few years, 
and maybe you’d make a few 
hundred dollars per issue. Would it 
be worth it?” 

“Yes! I’d do it for posterity. 
Someone must keep the faith baby, 
and carry the torch, and preserve 
the pure strain of sf that is being 
polluted by the insidious influence 
of the evil Literary disease that has 
swept into the precious bodily fluids 
of the genre.” 

“Every time you open your 
mouth your eyes light up, did you 
know that? I am right to keep you

GALAXY 




rl.N EDUCATED MAN among 
Philistines is like a nymphomaniac 
among impotents; both are vic- 
tims of inadequacy. For ten years 
I have been stranded on this most 
dismal of planets, lost in the com- 
pany of louts, isolated from all in- 
telligent society — and perhaps de- 
servedly so. 

But you decide. Here is my 
tragic tale, which I offer for the 
cautionary wisdom it contains. It 
is a parable of hubris. 

My name is Ozi Scarfolo. I 
came to Carver’s Planet some 
years ago as the business partner 
of the late Lotkin Abrams, who 
became better known as the Hi- 
Priest Iroc. 

I met Iroc when I was an in- 
structor at the University of 
Salada III, where, as the most 
junior member of the Department 
of Terran Culture, I was assigned 
mostly tutorials and labs. I had 
just concluded a remedial work- 
shop in Hamburger Fetishes of 
the Late Twentieth Century when 
Iroc, who was auditing the course, 
first approached me. 

He told me he was in the reli- 
gion business and that he was pre- 
paring to launch a new cult on 
Carver’s Planet. He claimed to be 
well connected at the Bureau of 
Theological Institutions (BOTI), 
thus assuring the success of his 
license application. I was impres- 
sed because, as everyone knows, 
it is extremely difficult to obtain 
government sanction of fledgling 

126 



religions. Iroc was eager to dis- 
cuss the use of Terran artifacts in 
his new religion, so I invited him 
back to my rooms. 

He was a tall emaciated fellow 
who reminded me of the cacti on 
New Texas: prickly and dry on 
the outside, spongy and a little 
rancid on the inside. He had a 
remarkably intense voice, the 
kind of voice that could reach out 
and throttle a man’s soul. 

We struck up a curious sort of 
friendship, based on the under- 
standing that our common inclina- 
tions and individual skills might 
make us rich men on the right 
planet. Now as a scholar I had 
always held that money does not 
buy happiness. I saw no harm, 
however, in testing my convic- 
tion. 

I am a hasty decider; since I 
was bored at the University, when 
Iroc proposed a partnership I ac- . 
cepted. And so I liquidated my 
modest savings and accompanied 
Iroc back to Carver’s. 

Carver’s Planet is a captive of 
Star 803-44-I-, located near the , 
galactic rim. It is mostly ocean, 
with a single large continent 
which endures a subtropical cli- ; 
mate. On the great central plain ■ 
of the single landmass lies the ‘• 
major population center, the Twin 
Cities of Begorrah and Salem. 
They are divided by the lara 
River; Begorrah on the east bank, j 
Salem on the west. The Twin I 
Cities are as alike as holes in 1 

GALAXY I 




bread, and about as interesting. I 
speak from experience. 

Carver’s has a Federation 
Technological Rating of 2000TA, 
which means that its civilization is 
roughly equivalent • to that of the 
average Terran culture of the Year 
2000. Throughout its history the 
Garverian culture has been based 
on the cultivation of Arachis 
Hypogaea — the domestic peanut. 
Settled as a company planet, it 
fought its War of Independence in 
2434 and has vegetated under a 
thinly-disguised oligarchy ever 
since. 

The Carverians are a fallen 
people whose speech patterns 
clearly exhibit the twang of the 
outworlds. They are direct de- 
scendants of the ancient Sapiens 
League, losers of the Eugenics 
War of 2102, who willingly ac- 
cepted economic slavery in ex- 
change for the chance to become 
extinct in private. They delight in 
the prosaic pleasures of all declin- 
ing cultures: the occult, spectator 
sports, and nostalgia. The Car- 
verians have a great love for their 
Old Earth heritage, a love which 
is unchecked by their failing 
reason. Each household boasts a 
small collection of antiques to 
which each generation is expected 
to add. Their economy is based 
on this custom. 

Upon my arrival on Carver’s I 
found that all Iroc had told me 
was true. BOTI did indeed grant 
us a hcense. Iroc began to exper- 



iment with a small ectoplasmic 
amplifier, trying to establish hard 
contact with the spirit world. We 
set up headquarters on Iroc’s 
feirm, seven miles north of Salem 
on the lara. We rechristened the 
place Zo-ar, and filed for incorpo- 
ration under the name of The 
Sacred Grove of Zo-ar, Inc. 

The first months of our ven- 
ture were busy ones. Iroc was 
constantly wandering through the 
fields with his amplifier, talking to 
the planet-spirits. Most planets 
have at least one of these so- 
called gods, scientifically referred 
to as ectoplasts. According to 
BOTI, Carver’s has several. Iroc 
had to make sure that he enlisted 
the most powerful spirit available 
for our cult. 

Immediately after the existence 
of the ectoplasts had been 
documented, there was much 
speculation in the scientific com- 
munity on the dynamics of the 
man-god relationship. How can a 
high-frequency wave phenomenon 
benefit from human worship? 
How do the gods manage their 
showy but overpraised miracles? 
After the Mystery Cult Affair and 
the madness on Orlu, however, 
BOTI was established to regulate 
the gods’ power over men. 

Now only BOTI speculates, and 
its secrets are well-kept. No other 
group can have a liason with an 
ectoplast without BOTI’s consent, 
and it does not permit research.

The average citizen of the galaxy 
does not miss the knowledge, 
however; most are quite content 
to practice their own cults and let 
BOTI worry about the larger 
questions. It is a reasonable indif- 
ference, since during its entire ex- 
istence BOTI has never let a god 
get out of hand. 

There were times, however, 
when I was afraid that Iroc had 
let his own gods get out of hand. 
He would be gone for days, then 
come crawling back into Zo-ar 
chewing on dead snakes and 
speaking in tongues through his 
ears. Given sufficient rest in a 
warm dark place, however, he al- 
ways recovered his senses and re- 
turned to his search. 

Eight months after I first ar- 
rived on Carver’s, Iroc revealed 
that he had come to an agreement 
with one of the ectoplasts. His 
Goddess refused to reveal Her 
identity, however. I seized upon 
Her personality quirk to bill our 
religion as the Cult of the God- 
dess with No Name. It had just 
the right touch of mystery to at- 
tract the sort of loon who would 
spend a lifetime on a planet like 
Carver’s. 

Meanwhile, I was devoting all 
my efforts to building an oracle at 
Zo-ar. I chose as my motif 
stylized models of each of the 
eighteen most famous cities in the 
galaxy, each to represent one of 
the eighteen stages of life. I 
began with Salem and Begorrah, 



then moved on to legendary 
names like Marsport, Sheol, Ar- 
mageddon, and Newark. These 
models, each big enough to hold a 
dozen pilgrims at a time, I ar- 
ranged in a huge hezagram man- 
dala; three to a side with conces- 
sion stands at every corner. 
Through each model ran a grassy 
path fraught with obstacles. 

Those seeking knowledge of the 
future struck a small mystic orb 
with a variant of the crosier and 
propelled it into the mazelike 
model. Each time it came to a 
stop, they paused, meditated, 
then propelled it again. Their goal 
was the Well of Understanding 
which lay at the heart of every 
model. When their orb fell into 
the Well, they consulted the 
Deacon of the Well. He gave 
them a numerological interpreta- 
tion of the number of strokes they 
had taken, then passed them 
along to the next stage of life. 

Of course the Deacons were 
not trained in numerology, since 
everyone knows that numerology 
is the worst sort of charlatanism. 
They were hooked up via ectop- 
lasmic relay to the Goddess, Who 
would use Her clairvoyant powers 
to make the minor predictions re- 
quired of Her. Using local people 
as Deacons enabled us to build a 
tremendous feeling of community 
in our cult, for bi-annually we 
would canvass our flock for those 
we thought most deserving to 
serve at the Sacred Grove.

The Goddess blessed our en- 
terprise and we prospered. In 
our second year we 
opened up affiliates across the 
continent, and attendance at Zo-ar 
shot uj) over the three million 
mark. Then disaster struck. 

We first heard of the spaceport 
bond issue over the 3D. Newton 
Shaw’s 18 o’clock report was just 
beginning as the pilgrims settled 
in for the only non-religious 
amusement permitted at the Sac- 
red Grove. The excitement was, 
plain on the announcer’s face; 
Salem and Begorrah had floated a 
joint municipal bond of half a 
million joirols for the construction 
of a third metropolitan spaceport. 

The resolution authorized the 
purchase of our own Zo-ar by the 
people’s right of eminent domain. 
The people’s right indeed! We 
had soon learned that only Peanut 
Barons have rights on this planet. 

Shaw showed us a rendering of 
the proposed spaceport. It looked 
like a concrete pizza. He inter- 
viewed a creature of the Chamber 
of Commerce who strutted before 
charts which showed that the facil- 
ity would create 20,000 jobs over 
the sixteen years it would take to 
build, and would Double Carver’s 
export-import capability. I was 
not impressed. 

But the final insult came at the 
end of the show when Shaw smil- 
ingly warned against the opposi- 
tion of “religious fanatics and 
parochial nay-sayers” who wanted

to condemn the planet to eternal 
provincialism. “We need this 
spaceport to move forward, to 
progress in our search for our 
glorious past!” he editorialized. 

It was the arrogance of the man 
that set Iroc off. He hurled his 
crosier at the fragile screen, rip- 
ping a large hole in it, thus wast- 
ing two months earnings from the 
Bingo Worship Workshops. It was 
very dramatic. 

“Blasphemy,” he cried out. 

“Amen,” replied the pilgrims. 

“Do you hear me, brothers and 
sisters?” 

“We hear you, O Iroc!” Their 
shout was like the din of traffic at 
rush hour in Groundnut Square. 

“I can’t hear you,” was Iroc’s 
reply. 

“. .hear you, O Iroc! ” Their 
shout was like the crash of a 
summer storm. 

“Louder.” 

“. .O IROC! ” Their shout was 
like the sound of an army march- 
ing through the husking rooms at 
the great peanut plant. 

The Hi-Priest paused, letting 
the power of their voices sink into 
their minds. Then he began to 
preach. His voice was the desert 
sun which withers all extraneous 
thought. 

“By the Goddess Who watches 
over Zo-ar, She Who has No 
Name, not one of these infidels 
shall desecrate this sacred soil 
with their unholy machines, as 
long as I have life in this body. 



This I swear to you.” 

With these words he thrust his 
hands toward the heavens and 
two bolts of lightning leapt from 
them. The pilgrims fell to their 
knees. Iroc spoke again; his words 
rumbled mightily, punctuating 
the divine bolts. 

“For what does it profit a man 
to break par, if he lose his immor- 
tal soul?” 

It was a nice effect. At first 
they were too astonished to man- 
age more than a meek “Amen.” 
Then they were all talking, shout- 
ing, crying at once. I couldn’t 
hear the rest of Iroc’s sermon, but 
the feet that he remained at the 
center of the crowd, gesticulating 
violently and adding his voice to 
the tumult, was sufficient to sway 
the crowd to the Goddess’s de- 
fense. 

Yet I could see that for all Iroc’s 
histrionics, his was but a victory 
of the moment. Our cult was but 
a small portion of the Carverian 
populace. No matter how fanatic 
our followers we couldn’t stand 
against the laws of the planet. 

It was the very next day, in 
fact, that two lawyers from the 
Twin Cities served us with writs 
of eviction. Messrs. Rudolf Krantz 
of Begorrah and Carnal Abdul 
Stern of Salem were two of the 
most supercilious and arrogant 
bureaucrats I had ever met. They 
wore traditional lawyer garb: 
lemon velvet doublets over cerise 
dickeys, kilts of the Hammurabi

clan and leather puttees. Each 
carried an imitation frog-skin at- 
tache case. 

We retired to Iroc’s pavilion. 
They exchanged glances, then 
bucked up for the right to speak 
first: Krantz taking odds. Stern 
evens. Krantz won. 

“Mr. Abrams. 

“Iroc.” 

“Yes. Of course. Mr. Iroc, as 
owner of this land. ” 

‘7 do not own this land. It is 
consecrated io the Goddess.” 

“Yes. We understand all that. 
But local divinities have no status 
before the laws of the Twin 
Cities.” 

“If the Twin Cities continue on 
this blasphemous course, they will 
lose their status before the divine 
laws of the Goddess.” 

The lawyers were nonplussed at 
the logic of Iroc’s statements. I 
took advantage of their momen- 
tary confusion to inquire about 
the conditions of the orders to va- 
cate. Stem replied that they were 
authorized to offer one thousand 
joirols for the land. He also prom- 
ised that the Twin Cities would 
assume responsibility for moving 
whatever we wished moved. I 
thought it was a generous offer 
and said so. 

Iroc was surly. “The Goddess 
must be consulted first.” 
suited first.” 

The lawyers started to protest 
that Iroc had no choice in the 
matter. The Hi-Priest rose ab- 



ruptly to his feet. 

“Begone!” he cried imperiously. 
A thick ochre mist began to 
issue from every orifice on his 
body. It flowed lazily toward 
Stem and Krantz. Suddenly both 
their attache cases croaked and 
jumped off the table. The Name- 
less One had transformed them 
into real, three-foot-long frogs. 
Messrs. Stern and Krantz beat 
an ungainly retreat, struggling in 
vain to control their slimy, kicking 
attache cases. Iroc turned his 
awful gaze on me; in his outrage 
he supposed me to be in collab- 
oration with the Twin Cities. I 
excused myself and left uncere- 
moniously. 

I MET IROC later that eveninjg as 
he was heading out to the fields 
to commune with the Goddess. 
He was so lost in his own 
thoughts that he didn’t notice my 
presence until I spoke. 

“I thought you had contacts in 
the Cities, ” I said glumly, as I fell 
into step alongside him, 

“Religion is one thing. Money 
is another. ” 

“We should accept their offer.” 
“She would never permit it,” 
“So? It’s our joirols at stake. If 
She can’t see things our way, 
send her back to hmbo and find a 
new god.” 

Iroc turned his head toward 
me, but in the darkness I couldn’t 
see his expression. I could feel 
some intense emotion, however.

winding up inside of him. 

“She will not permit such blas- 
phemy, even from Her inner cir- 
cle.” 

“But Iroc, you know that with- 
out us She’s just another number 
in BOTI’s files. She needs us, we 
don’t need Her. ” 

“She is more powerful than 
anyone imagines.” 

“She is only as powerhil as we 
let Her be. Take away the amp- 
lifier and the worshippers and 
She’s just another random packet 
of ectoplasmic energy.” 

Iroc thrust his face up close to 
mine. I could smell the tears on 
his cheeks. 

“I love Her, ” he said bitterly. 

I drew back sharply. I was 
shocked to see Iroc in this new 
light; he was not at all the sensi- 
ble materialist that I had taken 
him for. 

“That’s the craziest thing I ever 
heard of How can you be in love 
with an ultra-high-frequency wave 
phenomenon?” 

“It isn’t easy,” he admitted. 

He might have explained 
further had not an overpowering 
Presence intruded into our con- 
versation. 

It was the first time that I had 
ever experienced the Godhead 
without an amplifier. Although 
each human being experiences di- 
vinity in a different way, to me 
the Goddess manifested Herself as 
an immense, disembodied, 
motherly kiss. She was quite 

132 



pleasant at first, and I found my- 
self unwillingly responding to Her 
psychic caress. But as passion re- 
placed maternalism I began to 
fear that She might suck me com- 
pletely inside out. 

As I dropped to my knees from 
weakness I jostled Iroc, who had 
lost all pretense of self-control. 
Watching his possession made it 
easier for me to resist Her, until 
at last I was able to get up and 
run for my sanity. Her mocking 
laughter chased me all the way 
back to my pavillion. 

Iroc had not returned by the 
time Stem and Krantz arrived to 
receive the Goddess’s answer. I 
was worried about him, and was 
uncertain how much of my mis- 
givings I should reveal to them. I 
decided not to say anything more 
than necessary. The two of them 
looked grim — and they made a 
point of carrying their materials in 
brown paper bags. 

They were even less happy 
when I informed them that Iroc 
might not be available. 

“Why do you people insist on 
muddling up a perfectly clear bus- 
iness transaction with all this 
trickery and cheap illusion?” 
asked Stem petulantly. 

“I assure you, gentlemen, I 
don’t want to cause problems.” 
“Well you already have,” said 
Krantz. “You and Iroc will have 
some explaining to do to BOTI 
after yesterday. ” 

At that moment Iroc 



GALAXY 




materialized in front of us, radiat- 
ing an aura of divine jxDwer. 

“The Nameless One says that 
She will never depart from Her 
Sacred Grove. She has taken it as 
Her home for all eternity. All who 
propose to desecrate it will suffer 
Her terrible wrath.” 
rible wrath.” 

“Now Iroc. .” I began. 

“All unbelievers and blasphem- 
ers must leave Zo-ar!” he cried, 
levelling a rabid look at me. A 
sphere of oily blackness began to 
form around him. Stern caught 
me by the arm. 

“Let’s go. ” 

Once outside, Krantz asked, 
“Where can we go to talk? Now.” 

“My pavillion is nearby.” 

“All right. ’’ 

We ran to my pavilhon, ignor- 
ing the pilgrims who had begun 
to pour out of the oracle, demand- 
ing refunds. Apparently the God- 
dess was in no mood for 
prophecy. 

^^HEN WE WERE secure in my 
rooms, Krantz began pulling parts 
of what appeared to be a disas- 
sembled amplifier from one of the 
paper bags. Stem positioned him- 
self by the window. The sky was 
darkening ominously; there was 
panic in the pilgrims’ angry shouts 
of betrayal. Krantz spoke in short, 
chpped sentences. 

“I thought it would come to 
this. All right Scarfolo, the game’s 
over. We’re not lawyers at all. 



We’re agents of BOTI. We’ve 
been watching your cult ever 
since Iroc first applied for a 
license.” 

“Why?” 

Krantz looked to Stern across 
the room. “Your ectoplast,” he 
said, “Do you know Who She is?” 
“Uh. She told us She was 
the Goddess with No Name.” 
“That’s just an afias. She’s really 
Isis, escaped again from Orlu.” 

My starry future novaed; Iroc, 
Zo-ar and I were finished. The 
Nameless One was one of the 
dread Mystery Cult Gods! Years 
before They had attempted a re- 
ligious coup by destroying all the 
other ectoplasts in the Cygnus 
sector. Their insane goal was 
galactic monotheism. It was only 
after they were narrowly defeated 
that BOTI had been set up to 
protect the religious freedom of 
the human races. 

Krantz continued, “. so we 
bought off the local politicos. We 
convinced them to place their 
spaceport here instead of half a 
mile upriver. That way we’d have 
an excuse for monitoring your 
cult. We didn’t count on Her 
going crazy like this and defying 
legal municipal orders. ” 

“What’s going to happen to us 
now? She seems to be preparing 
something awfiil for us.” 

“We ll be all right if we can get 
the Converter working. ” 

“The Converter?” 

“Central has decided that the 



DEA EX MACHINA 



133 




only way to teach the gods a les- 
son is to make an example of Isis. 
The Converter will change Her 
from spirit to matter. But we can 
only use it as long as Iroc keeps 
his amplifier on. It fixes Her iden- 
tity in one place.” 

“But I still don’t understand. 
What is the Converter? What will 
happen to Her when you turn it 
on?” 

Stern walked away from the 
window and approached Krantz. 
He watched Krantz’s slow pro- 
gress nervously for a moment. 
Then he spoke. 

“It’s what we used on them the 
first time. It’s what keeps the bad 
ones on Orlu and the good ones 
in line. When we turn this on, 
your Goddess will come pouring 
out of the sky. She’ll be dead. ” 

“The grove. .” 

”... will probably be totally 
buried under Her. That’s why 
we re telling you this. You’d bet- 
ter start to evacuate the place 
right now.” 

I went out among the pilgrims, 
who were just then beginning to 
■push and shove one another: a 
human illustration of the principle 
of Brownian motion. The sky had 
turned the color of a poorly 
erased blackboard. I called out to 
them to return to their homes. I 
told them that the Goddess was 
displeased with their hypocritical 
worship, and that if they didn’t 
leave immediately She’d work 
some awful evil on them all. The 

134 



ensuing stampede was messy but 
eflFective. 

I thought for a moment of look- 
ing for Iroc, of pitting my reason 
against the Goddess’s charms. The 
memory of that godly kiss, how- 
ever, made me think better of it. 
I decided instead to check back 
with Krantz and Stern. 

They were both working now, 
and were too absorbed in their 
task to do more than order me to 
run for my life. Though I knew I 
was merely trading one kind of 
death for another, I took their ad- 
vice. 

Just before I reached the outer 
boundaries of the Grove there 
was a clap of thunder. The sky 
began to lighten again and, to my 
astonishment, it began to snow. 
At first I didn’t stop to investi- 
gate; I wasn’t sure that I’d come 
far enough. Eventually I slowed 
down, since ahead of me there 
were only light flurries. I was 
saved. 

I slowed to a walk and stooped 
quickly to pick up a handful of the 
stuff. Of course, it wasn’t snow at 
all, but some sort of very thin, 
spongy wafer. It smelled like 
fresh bread. I broke off a corner 
and tasted it. 

It was delicious, like some 
heavenly essence of peanut butter 
and honey sandwich. The word 
for it focused in my mind with 
dizzying clarity. 

Manna. 

I reflected on the Goddess’s 

GALAXY 




precipitious dissolution with some 
anxiety as I brushed flakes of my 
late Benefactress from my clo- 
thing. My situation was grim. I 
had started the day a wealthy pre- 
late; I would finish it a friendless 
pauper. 

I was roused from my reverie 
by shouts. I turned and looked 
back into the blizzard. I could see 
Krantz and Stern plowing through 
waist-deep accumulations of the 
stuff. But it was not their shouts 
that had caught my attention. 
Much farther back, buried up to 
the armpits and no longer mov- 
ing, not even trying to escape, 
was Iroc. 

I watched in horror as the drift 
engulfed him. His last words still 
haunt my soul, a summation of 
the futility of his life. 

“Mmmmmmmmf,” he cried. 

Shortly after Iroc went under, 
the two spurious lawyers stag- 
gered out of the manna-fall. I had 
to tug each of them to the shelter 
of a nearby stand of trees, where 
they sank gratefully to the 
ground, panting from fear and ex- 
haustion. 

“You saw what happened to 
Iroc?” I asked. 

Krantz managed a nod. 

“And the Goddess is . ?” 

Stern gestured feebly at the 
storm, now slowly subsiding. 

"Against BOTI the gods them- 
selves contend in vain,” I said pi- 
ously. 

“But listen. What do you people 



intend to do about my investment? I 
should be compensated for my los- 
ses.” 

Something caught in Stern’s 
throat. Krantz merely shook his 
head. Then, catching his breath 

Then, catching his breath with 
with difficulty he gasped, “Com- 
pensated! You’ve embarrassed the 
entire Bureau. After what hap- 
pened here you’ll be lucky if we 
recommend leniency.” 

Ah well! My tale really ends 
there on the borders of Zo-ar, al- 
though my life seems to drag on 
interminably. The trial was brief 
and notorious. They said I’d viol- 
ated BOTI guidelines. “Impossi- 
ble to prove,” I reasoned soundly. 
They said I’d defied Carverian 
writs. “It was my partner,” I ar- 
gued pointedly. They said I’d 
cheated, deceived and disil- 
lusioned my flock for personal 
gain. I said nothing. 

Only Krantz and Stern’s good 
word at the last minute saved me 
from the peanut farms. Of course, 
as a convicted criminal I can’t 
apply for a travel permit, so I 
might as well be incarcerated. 
And I can’t find decent employ- 
ment since I am both well-known 
and despised. Occasionally I pen 
historical monographs or religious 
greeting cards under , a 
pseudonym. .Thus I survive, but 
to what end? 

My dreams are filled with lust 
for the sweet, soft, flaky embrace 
of the Goddess.

CHEAP 

THRILLS 




Two OF THE SLAVES rodc on the 
back of the cart as its large wooden 
wheels cut parallel furrows from the 
gate on the side to the center of the 
arena. The third slave, a short, fat, 
animated man, pulled the nags hard 
by their harnesses. 

The cart came to a halt beside the 
body, and the two slaves on the 
back jumped down onto the grey 
sand. The torso of the body was 
circled by a dark red stain of al- 
ready dried blood. Its right arm had 
been severed before the short sword 
had plunged into its naked side. 

One of the slaves looked dispas- 
sionately for a moment at the 
glassy-eyed bearded face. Then he 
grabbed the body by its remaining 
arm, and heaved it into the cart. 
The other slave tossed the severed 
limb on top of the corpse. 



The third slave, the fat one, 
sweated and cursed the flies. He 
kicked one of the horses hard on its 
bony side. The cart began to move 
again. It still had to pick up two 
more bodies. 

The crowd was becoming impa- 
tient. The afternoon contests should 
have begun already — and the corpses 
from the morning games were 
still being removed! The hot, noon- 
day sun beat down on the mob’s 
frustration. 

A vendor with a large basket of 
dirty cakes surveyed the crowd con- 
temptuously. Provincial town, pro- 
vincial dirt arena. He had been a 
vendor in Rome. Those were good 
games: stone seats; crowds of fifty 
thousand; and contests that started 
on time. 

He grabbed one of his harder 
cakes and threw it in disgust at the 
slaves loading the last body. The 
cake hit against a wheel of the cart 
with a loud thud. The people 
around him laughed. Within sec- 
onds a stone arced through the air 
and struck a horse. It was quickly 
followed by another, then another. 
Soon the crowd was searching fran- 
tically for rocks. 

The slaves ran quickly toward the 
entrance on the other side of the 
arena under a hail of stones. Two 
made it. The fat one, though, was 
hit in the head with a large rock as 
he crossed the center. He fell, and 
struggled to rise as rocks pounded 
his body. He made it to his knees. 

Getting the slave put the crowd 



CHEAP THRILLS 



137 



into a good humor. The men around 
the vendor began to buy from him. 
They joked about the hardness of 
his cakes and about the dead slave. 
He quickly lost his contempt for 
them. Maybe the afternoon games 
will be good, he thought. Dwarves 
and women, maybe. « 

The guards cut the bonds of the 
naked prisoner, then shoved him 
into the arena. For a moment he lay 
where he fell, blinded by the sun- 
light. A shield and a short sword 
were thrown on top of him. 

He was a large, muscular man, a 
captured Vandal. He had fought 
many times and he could fight well. 
Even so, two weeks of captivity and 
bad food had weakened him. 

He picked up the sword and 
swung it, feeling its weight and 
size. It isn't long enough. He ig- 
nored the shield; he had never used 
one. 

His opponent dropped fifteen feet 
from the first terrace to the arena 
floor. He was a young professional, 
trying to kill his way into the Col- 
osseum with a net and a trident. He 
advanced toward the barbarian. 

The Vandal circled toward the 
center of the arena, warily watching 
the Roman’s net. / can kill him 
quickly. He moves awkwardly. A 
yearling dog. / will have one more 
Roman head, despite this cursed 
sword. , 

He feinted forward, and the 
Roman swung his net around in a 
wide arc. As it swung by him, the 
Vandal darted in, and slammed his 



sword edge into his opponent’s hip. 

The Roman collapsed onto the 
sand, blood spurting from his 
wound. He quickly rose to one 
knee, his trident raised. The Vandal 
moved toward him searching for an 
opening. He will die from that cut. 
But I will make sure he dies 
quickly. 

Suddenly he stopped. He looked 
around dazedly, as if he himself had 
been struck. Then he looked again 
at the fallen Roman. He raised his 
sword and continued his approach. 
This time, though, he moved awk- 
wardly and uncertainly. 

As he hesitated, his enemy re- 
gained his feet and picked up his 
fallen net. The Vandal attacked, 
swinging wildly at his adversary’s 
head. The Roman easily ducked the 
unskillful blow. 

The Vandal jumped backward to 
avoid the flying net and so it caught 
him perfectly, in mid-air. He 
crashed to the ground, entangled in 
its heavy folds — and fell on his own 
sword edge, which slashed his 
back. / have no subconscious con- 
trol except memory function, he 
thought. No higher conditioned re- 
flex. 

As he struggled to kick free of 
the net, he watched the Roman 
slowly approach, trident raised, 
dragging his blood-red leg. He 
twisted desparately, and the trident 
plunged into the bottom of his rib 
cage, then into the hot sand. No 
longer able to stand, the Roman 
crashed to the ground beside him.

The Vandal’s giant frame heaved 
as he coughed blood onto the hot 
sand. The pain is hideous. It’s sup- 
posed to be like that, I know — a 
Class C Experience. Still, I hope 
reverse transposition occurs 
quickly. 

Then he crawled to his knees and 
another consciousness looked franti- 
cally around the arena. / was win- 
ning. I was going to kill him. Now 
on my knees with a trident in my 
side. I can't remember. He looked 
at the struggling form of the fallen 
gladiator beside him. I will still get 
my head. He crawled toward his 
opponent, sword in hand. As he 
moved, the trident jerked along the 
ground, tearing up his guts. 

The Roman saw him coming, and 
painfully stood up on his good leg. 
Blood still poured from his hip. (I 
cut him well, the Vandal thought. 
The rest I don’t remember. But I 
cut him well.) 

The Roman quickly stooped and 
grabbed the shaft of the trident, 
wrenching it from his side. Then 
drove it into his skull. 

The crowd roared its approval. 

The sun was setting redly on the 
edge of the desert. John Awatobi 
watched it as he knocked the dust 
from his boots against the running 
board of his pick-up. He watched it 
to see it change color. It didn’t. 1 
have lost power. Before I could see 
the minute hand of my watch move. 
And the setting sun change color. 

The short, stocky Navajo swung 



into the doorless cab of the pick-up, 
turned the ignition key and pressed 
the starter button. The engine turned 
over and he backed the truck away 
from his wooden shack and onto the 
dusty parallel tire paths which dis- 
appeared into the desert. It’s a good 
sign, the truck starting the first 
time. I will find power at tonight’s 
ceremony. 

The sun had become a dull 
orange. He pressed the accelerator 
to the floor. I will have to get to the 
meeting before it gets dark. The 
headlights didn’t work. 

He had lost power in 
Albuquerque. No way for an Indian 
to live, making money in a boot fac- 
tory. Away from the desert, away 
from the peyote ceremony, away 
from my people, away from God, 
sewing leather in the dark corner of 
a boot factory. He had not only 
been unhappy, he had also lost 
power and had gotten sick. Now he 
had returned, and the peyote would 
return his strength. 

Xenon slipped through the dark, 
silent corridor thinking illegal 
thoughts. He had just completed his 
work period, and he was going 
from his work site to the transposi- 
tion chambers. It was the only time 
it was possible to think non-work- 
related thoughts; illegal, chaotic 
thoughts. 

The rest of the time, he could 
concentrate on his work. Because 
the rest of the time there were no 
distractions.

Not only did distractions make 
work less efficient, they were also 
unstable. So they had been elimi- 
nated. 

The Goal, society’s Goal, was 
complete stability. All work, in one 
way or another, led to the Goal. 
Complete stability meant complete 
knowledge, the Equation which en- 
compassed every variable. 

The big problems had been the 
easiest to solve. They had become 
independent of the dying sun. They 
had eliminated most other life 
forms. They maintained a com- 
pletely stable population. 

It was the smaller variables that 
were difficult-. The effects of a 
single microbe or a single erratic 
human cell. The effect of light from 
distant stars. 

The human variables were even 
more difficult. Not the mechanical 
distractions — digestion , reproduc- 
tion, sleep, and motion — those had 
been solved easily. The only motion 
that was still required was the trip 
to the transportation chambers. And 
even that didn’t require motion of 
the body itself. Still, it was motion, 
and Tnotion was both contrary to 
stability and distracting to woiic. 

Xenon had received a communi- 
cation that future transposition would 
take place at the work site. The last 
mechanical distraction had been 
solved. No more illegal thoughts.) 

The mental distractions were the 
difficult ones. A brain couldn’t 
work forever in an almost- 
completely-stable environment with- 



out being destroyed. A brain needed 
sensual and emotional input. 

An Experience, a transposition 
to a past body, compensated for the 
sensory deprivation of a work 
period. In the past body, a sense- 
starved brain fed on pleasure, pain, 
light, color, sound, sex; felt fear, 
tension, aggression, joy. All of 
which was a normal part of the 
past, but distractions in the present. 

After an Experience, a person 
could concentrate on his work for 
another forty or sixty hours. 

Xenon arrived at the transposition 
chambers. The Regulator communi- 
cated the type of Experience he was 
to have. Class X — religious. 

A person never knew exactly 
what his Experience would be. And 
he never remembered what it had 
been. Non-work-related memory 
was distracting. 

But he knew what general type to 
expect. He wouldn’t enter an ag- 
gression Experience ready to sing, 
or a sex Experience ready to fight. 

The pick-up sped along the dirt 
road toward the fading light in the 
western sky. Abruptly the road 
curved around a small, sandy rise, 
and instead of following it the truck 
continued in its straight path. As 
soon as it left the road, a front tire 
hit a rock and exploded. The pick- 
up fishtailed up the rise to a sudden 
halt. A dusty Navajo climbed out of 
the cab, and dazedly searched his 
memory for clues to repairing the 
truck and reaching his destination.

Fifteen minutes later he pulled up 
beside a wooden house on the out- 
skirts of a small reservation town. 
There were other old junkyard cars 
parked outside, as well as a new 
’54 Chevy. A group of men and 
women were conversing outside the 
door. 

‘’John Awatobi’s back,” one of 
them said as he climbed out of the 
truck and walked toward them. He 
greeted them as best he could. 

Transporsition didn’t work 
with all past bodies. Only with the 
ones that didn’t matter. The ones 
that couldn’t possibly affect the fu- 
ture because they would die soon, 
or because any accomplishment they 
had power to make would be 
quickly washed away by the strong 
current of history. 

So, while the past one’s con- 
sciousness was stored in the pres- 
ent, the consciousness of the 
invader-parasite couldn’t do any- 
thing to change the future. Even if 
he wanted to. 

It was good. Shaking hands, 
friendly arms on his back, people 
joking and calling him by name. 
John Awatobi. He had only been 
half an hour in the past body, yet 
already he was identifying with the 
past body’s name. 

The meeting began with singing, 
then prayers. A sense of brother- 
hood, of oneness, became the over-, 
riding consciousness.

fought its way down his throat, into 
his empty stomach. Nausea swirled 
around the incessant pain of sitting 
on the hard wooden floor. 

Time passed. He ate two more 
buds. He watched (his) friends sit- 
ting cross-legged, meditating, and 
he watched the fire bum, and the 
colors on the wall tapestries swirl 
around themselves, then leave their 
two-dimensional prison to curl into 
the space of the room. 

He watched as Jesus materialized 
before him and said “I give you 
power and health and brotherhood 
with the World,” and then left. His 
identity with Xenon faded and he 
became John Awatobi. The subcon- 
scious of the Navajo melted into his 
consciousness, and Awatobi’s mind 
became integrally fused with his 
own. 

John awatobi broke out of his 
meditation and looked out the win- 
dow, grey with false dawn. He rose 
and went outside to piss. A power- 
ful meeting. I don’t remember it. 
But I feel it: it has changed me. I 
have gained power. He could see 
the sky slowly brighten. He quickly 
constructed a rough equation of 
light intensity as a function of time. 
Then he buttoned his fly and went 
back inside to talk with friends he 
hadn’t seen for three months. 

NON was in the middle of the 
dark timelessness of a work period. 
His machines and his machine-like 
mind churned monodirectionally 



toward the Goal. Nutrients and 
stimulants poured into his blood- 
stream, waste products poured out 
through elaborate catheters, 
machines regulated his body tem- 
perature and respiration, repairing 
failing tissue. He lay motionlessly 
in his mechanical womb. Advancing 
the Equation. Solving stability. 

Suddenly his mind left his prob- 
lem. And confronted a darkening 
sky and a broken ’37 pick-up on the 
top of a sand dune. Shocked, he 
realized he was remembering his 
last transposition, his last Experi- 
ence. No one had ever done that be- 
fore. 

A distracting memory. But more 
than that, a distracting conscious- 
ness, the consciousness of John 
Awatobi fused with his own. 

An unknown variable had entered 
into the Equation. 

46'D 

I LAY FOR ME,” the lady said to 
the minstrel. 

The minstrel had played his 
music for her earlier. Then, even 
though he was reputed to be a very 
trustworthy minstrel, he had 
seduced her into letting him accom- 
pany her to her chambers. 

He rose from her bed and walked 
naked across the room to where his 
lute leaned against the stone wall. 
He handed it to her and sat on the 
bed beside her. 

“You play for me this time,” he 
said. 

She sat up holding a blanket to 
her breasts, and took the lute from 




142 



GALAXY 




him. She began to sing softly. 

He supposed he could play it, 
digging notes from subconscious 
memory. But musical talent, like 
fighting ability, was probably a 
combination of subconscious mem- 
ory and conscious attitude. He 
didn’t want to destroy an Experi- 
ence by playing bad music. 

The lady played well. 

It would be a good memory. 
Since the fusion with Awatobi, he 
was able to remember every Experi- 
ence in his distracted present body. 

Suddenly, he heard the scream of 
the lady’s servant in the outer 
chamber. The curtains hanging over 
the doorway parted, and a red-faced 
knight entered. The minstrel leaped 
up to protect the lady, then realized 
too late that he was the target. The 
sword thrust toward his groin and 
terror exploded over his conscious- 
ness. Then he was back. 

His awareness emerged at his 
work site. I’m glad / was spared 
that. Another distraction: guilt. The 
minstrel would have died of the 
plague in a month, and the lady 
would have fallen fatally from her 
horse before that. Still, it was a 
perverse freedom. To make deci- 
sions and have others pay the price. 
But it is better than living in the 
present. Here I am a slave: I make 
no decision at all. 

His sabotage began subtly. 

Time, measurable only in the 
number of Experiences, increased 



his memories and increased his 
emotions. He made mistakes in his 
work. He moved muscles that were 
not to be moved, and he made noise 
with his vocal chords. Once, he 
communicated a “have a happy Ex- 
perience’’ to a person nearing the 
end of his work period. He felt su- 
premely foolish (another distraction) 
when he did this, but it had helped. 

There were times when he longed 
to dance or sing or simply stand in 
the present body. Real singing and 
real dancing. But he always stopped 
himself. He knew that if he did, the 
flaw in his psyche would be moni- 
tored and fixed. And he would lose 
his memories of almost-real dancing 
in long-dead bodies. 

His fear of being found out grew 
to profoundly psychotic, distracting 
proportions. He tried to make the 
monitors in his section inoperative. 
Then he had to cover his traces by 
communicating lies to computers 
and to other people. And submit 
false solutions toward the Goal be- 
cause with all his distractions he 
didn’t have time to make them cor- 
rect. 

One work period he could no 
longer stand the motionless, time- 
less deadness of the present body. 
So he disconnected himself from the 
tubes, sensors, and machinery that 
had for centuries surrounded him. 

He was free. Because it was his 
own body, he was freer than he 
could ever be in a past body. This 
was a different freedom, a profound 
freedom.

He stretched muscles maintained 
at optimum strength by machines. 
Without the sense-deadeners pour- 
ing into his blood-stream, he could 
feel. He felt his body, his body, then 
yelled as loud as he could. 

It was, of course, too large a 
lapse to hide. The society would re- 
pair him, and if he were irreparable 
it would terminate him. And he no 
longer cared. That in itself was 
freedom. 

He walked out into a dark cor- 
ridor once used by machines when 
motion was necessary. He came to 
another work site. 

The dim figure inside the 
machinery was a woman, uncon- 
scious, living in a past body. Xenon 
began to free her from her machin- 
ery as he had freed himself. Her 
body also was in optimum condi- 
tion. Much better than past women, 
he thought. Not able to do anything 
else, he ran his hands slowly over 
her inert body. 

Suddenly, her consciousness 
transposited from the past. Her 
muscles tensed, and she stared at 
Xenon, shocked, completely dis- 
tracted. Then she made noise with 
her vocal chords and he left 
quickly. 

He walked down another corridor 
toward what had previously been 
the transposition chambers. Sud- 
denly he saw another man, leaning 
against the wall of the corridor. A 
Regulator. This time it was Xenon 
who was shocked. 

“Another one,” said the Reg- 



ulator. Then he looked at Xenon 
closely. “But I know who you are.” 

Xenon stared at him. The 
stranger had used his vocal chords 
to communicate. And he couldn’t 
know Xenon. 

“Why are you away from your 
work site?” he asked. 

“I was in my fortieth hour,” said 
the Regulator. “I got tired.” 

“How could you be tired?” 

“Not tired. The injections take 
care of that. Just bored. Distracted. 
In a way, it’s your fault.” 

“My fault? But that couldn’t . .” 

He knew he had been a decaying 
factor, a chaotic variable, a detour 
on their road to perfection. But he 
couldn’t have had that kind of in- 
fluence. He couldn’t have caused 
others to free themselves from their 
machinery. 

“It isn’t true,” he said firmly. 

“No? Then how do you explain 
it?” 

“You are flawed like myself. 
You’ve had a fusion during a trans- 
position.” 

“No. Not a fusion. True, it’s you 
who caused the deviation. But not 
in the way you think.” 

Suddenly Xenon understood. 

“You’re from the future,” he 
said. 

“Brilliant. But of course you an- 
cients were much more intelligent 
than we.” 

, “But why do you come here? It 
doesn’t make sense. Why don’t you 
go back further?” 



144 



GALAXY 




“Because of you. Time has mag- 
nified your flaw. The future is a 
very chaotic place to live.” 

“You need order?” It was dif- 
ficult to comprehend. 

“Yes. But more than that, we 
need to rest our emotions. We need 
to use our minds. And we need 
safety. 

‘‘Our emotions are wrenched 
hourly from love to hate, from de- 
spair to joy. Relationships between 
people are intense, complex, and 
inconstant. We are continuously 
bombarded by sensual stimuli. So 
we escape. To the most ordered 
period of our past. To your pres- 
ent.” 

“No one has ever transposited 
my brain,” said Xenon. 

“No one would; it’s too turbu- 
lent. It wouldn’t be much of an es- 
cape. But more importantly, we 
couldn’t have transposited into your 
body even if we wanted to. You 
have been the only one in the world 
at this time who matters. That is the 
Goal, you know. To create a soci- 
ety where no one matters. To create 
the ultimate stability; death. But 
you changed that. You changed the 
future.” 

“And I assume that I can no 
longer change the future.” 

“Correct. My ability to speak to 
you is evidence of that. I suspect 
that right now your society is mov- 
ing to eliminate you. What it can’t 
eliminate are the seeds of chaos 
you’ve planted.” 

Xenon considered the situation. It 



was time to make a decision. And 
pay the price himself. 

“If I no longer have power to af- 
fect the future, I can leave. I want 
to leave.” 

“How?” 

“Your host brain is a Regulator. 
Transposit me to a past body. For 
good.” 

The Regulator searched his mem- 
ory. 

“A permanent transposition 
would be difficult. The past body 
would have to be powerless or dead 
before you could possibly change 
history.” 

“I know. I just want to be free for 
more than ten minutes or ten hours 
at a time.” 

“The most time I can guarantee 
you is two months. Provided you 
make the right choices in the past 
body,” said the Regulator thought- 
fully. 

“Also, in a one-way transposi- 
tion, the details of time and place 
would be handled by the machinery. 
You will probably end up some- 
where you have been before.” 

Xenon thought of a lady who 
played the lute for him long before. 

“That’s all right,” he said. 

The two men walked toward the 
transposition chambers. 

He landed in a crouch on the 
hot sand. Grasping the heavy trident 
he faced the large barbarian who 
circled toward him, deftly stepping 
over the fly-covered body of the fat 
slave. it

ELMO’S BOX 



For I’very action there is an 
equal-and-opposite reaction! 



L. D. Fitzpatrick 



1 SEE where they’ve finally decided 
to close down the Blakefield 
Museum; stuff wouldn’t stop disap- 
pearing. It’s all Elmo’s fault. 

Elmo Famham’s great-grandfather 
was Amish; his grandfather lost the 
faith, baby, and Came Out Into the 
World. I’ve often wished I could meet 
that old gentleman; I’d love to bust 
him in the mouth, just once. 

I’m Ed Jenkins, Elmo’s oldest 
and closest friend — or rather least 
acrimonious enemy. He doesn’t 
need friends; what he needs are 
keepers. 

You see, he likes to invent 
gadgets — Great-Grandpa must be 
doing about a thousand r.p.m. 
— which he then sells to people 
as screwy as he is. (He likes to 
quote Edison’s maxim about genius 
being 2% inspiration and 98% per- 
spiration, and then add that while 
that may have been all right for a 
quaint, old-fashioned type like Edi- 
son, smirk, smirk, he won’t settle 
for anything less than 50-50.) His 
sales, and wipning defamation of 
character lawsuits, keep bread and 
Bordeaux on the table, but it causes 
ulcers. But not usually in Elmo; 
he’s what doctors call a Carrier. 

Except this time. 

I was sitting in his living 
room — a masochistic habit of 
mine — when I had occasion to 
throw a beer can away. I had to 
hunt for an unfilled trash basket, 
which caused me to remark irrita- 
bly, “You want to invent some- 
thing, why don’t you invent a way 



to get rid of trash?’’ 

“I have,” he answered calmly. 
“I just throw trash in, and it comes 
out in a chasm in the Himalayas.” 
“Figures. Only you would use 
the Top of the World for a garbage 
dump,” I said acidly. Then I did a 
double take. (Okay, I’m slow. So 
sue me.) “Hey, you mean you have 
a teleport machine?” 

“Yes — well, no, not really. It’s 
something like a teleporter. A 
teleporter was what I was looking 
for, but what I got. .ah, the hell 
with it.” He shifted to a more com- 
fortable position in his chair. “I 
don’t feel like talking about it.” He 
twisted irritably. “It’s goddam frus- 
trating. I got an idea, thought 
maybe I could get a teleportation 
machine. Worked on it for two 
years, damn near worked my butt 
off, and now I got it, it isn't, re- 
ally, so I got nothing for my trou- 
ble. Damn. I could of made a for- 
tune.” 

“You’ve already got a fortune.” 
“I’ve got several fortunes, and 
I’ve spent several dozen fortunes; 
always room for one more.” 

“I don’t know what good another 
invention would do you. Even you 
can’t earn it — or even spend it 
— faster than they can print it.” 

He grinned. “Maybe not, but a 
man can try.” 

We fell silent for a moment. 
Elmo stared into the fire — which 
shows you what a big detonation he 
is, because what mere mortal could 
afford to burn wood. 



147 




Finally I said, “Okay, it isn’t a 
teleporter. So what is it?’’ 

He looked up. “You still on that? 
I said I don’t want to talk about it. 
Change the subject.’’ He stared 
morosely into the fire a moment and 
then said abruptly, “It’s an 
alternate-universe machine.’’ 
That’s Elmo. He’s so contrary he 
won’t even do what he wants. 

I raised my eyebrows. “You’ve 
got a machine that creates alternate 
universes?” 

“Not creates. Contacts.” He 
started to warm to his subject; he 
loves to explain. “The universes 
— call them alternates — already 
exist; I’ve managed to prove that 
there are a transfinite number of 
them.” 

“You mean an infinite number?” 

“Not just a simple infinity 
— denser. 

Just looked blank. 

“Look, you know, I presume, 
about Heisenburg’s Uncertainty 
Principle?” 

“In a vague sort of way,” I said. 

“The Principle states that the 
position and momentum of an ob- 
ject are indeterminate; the object 
doesn’t act as if those quantities had 
exact values — there’s always a 
small uncertainty. The product of 
the uncertainties of the momentum 
and of the position is a constant. 
The tighter the constraints on the 
momentum — that is the smaller the 
uncertainty — the looser the con- 
straints on the position — that is the 
larger the uncertainty. It has to be 



that way, or the equation won’t 
come out right. Write the equation 
another way, and the energy an ob- 
ject has during a given event and 
the duration of the event are related 
in the same way. 

“A whole slew of things 
— radioactive decays, fissions, 
photon emissions — are influenced or 
controlled by the Principle. 

“Now, for any event, each 
Principle-influenced quantity has an 
infinite number of values it can 
take — all within a very narrow 
range, of course. Now for every 
event in space-time, there exists a 
universe for each value each quan- 
tity can adopt.” 

I chewed on that one for a while. 
“Then for every point in time, 
there’s an infinite number of alter- 
nates. No, more than that because 
at any given point in time there are 
an infinite number of events occur- 
ring, so — ” 

“Not infinite,” grunted Elmo. 
“The number’s large, but finite. It’s 
less than the factorial of the number 
of particles in the universe.” 

“You don’t know for sure that 
the number of particles in the uni- 
verse isn’t infinite,” I pointed out. 

“Unh. Well, yeah, that’s true, at 
least in theory,” he admitted. “But 
practically, we can assume the uni- 
verse is finite. Besides, you’d still 
be wrong. The numbers aren’t mul- 
tiplicative, they’re exponential. 
Look, think of it as a tree. The 
trunk is our universe. Every point 
on the truck has an infinite number 



148 



GALAXY 




of branches. Let’s consider all the 
branches from the trunk at a certain 
height. Just above that point, the 
trunk would branch again — ami so 
would all the branches.'” 

“Yeek! You’re right!” 1 tried 
to chart it in my mind. ‘‘Good 
Lord! To graph it, you’d need an 
infinite number of dimensions, even 
for a finite section of it!” 

‘‘You mean a bounded section. 
That’s why I said there were a 
transfinite number of them, instead 
of just an infinite number.” 

‘‘I boggle. How do you find a 
particular alternate?” 

‘‘I don’t. I Just set limits — rather 
large limits unfortunately — and the 
machine bounces around at random 
inside those limits. The selection 
process is also controlled by the 
Principle, so it has to be 
random — there’s no help for it.” 

I thought for a moment. “And 
you can send something anywhere 
in one of these alternate worlds?” 
“Sure. I told you, 1 was looking 
for a matter transmitter. But the 
transmission effect is tied up with 
alternatives — and there’s no way to 
untie ’em.” 

“Too bad. But it seems to me 
that alternate-universe effect could 
still be useful.” 

He shrugged. “Maybe later. It’s 
not finished; I’m going to add a 
view screen and a force-field to pro- 
' tect the traveler. Right now, 
though, it’s too dangerous to be 
useful.” 

“How d’you figure dangerous?”

"Look, you jerk, the energy 
differences’ll be small, but that still 
leaves room for big differences be- 
tween alternates from the point of 
view of, say, sociology or biology. 
I could be arrested for wearing 
socks, or attacked by unicorns, or 
any damn thing. There wouldn’t be 
any rules any more.” 

“I don’t see that. In fact, consid- 
ering how small these Heisenburg 
changes all are, I don’t see how 
they could cause gross changes 
— unless you’re talking about alter- 
nates that are a very large number 
of branchings away from ours?” 

He gestured impatiently. “Don’t 
be ridiculous. The Principle — even 
in single applications — it shows up 
on the macroscopic scale — a lot. 
Look, say a man makes a random 
decision, one where all things are 
equal, so he’s just picking his 
choice out of thin air. Say he’s 
picking a number to play at roulette. 
His choice will be influenced by the 
Principle. Any arbitrary decision- 
— and a person makes ’em all day 
long — is like that. You can change 
a man’s life completely just by 
changing Heisenburg events.” 

I thought about that. I wasn’t 
sure I liked it. “You’re saying free 
will is the Uncertainty Principle.” 
‘‘You got it.” He smiled deri- 
sively. ‘‘ ‘The displacement is 
small, and the momentum high, that 
leads to salvation.’ Hallelujah!” I 
colored, and he snickered. 

“I don’t see how that could get 
you attacked by unicorns,” I said, 



to change the subject. 

He looked at me as if I were an 
idiot child. ‘‘Look, it’s not just 
mental things; for instance, out of 
millions of spermatozoa, a particu- 
lar one fertilizes the egg. That’s in- 
fluenced by the Principle. So are 
mutations. So are any number of 
other things.” 

I WAS THINKING about that when I 
left his house that night. My 
thoughts were eerie. A slight, ran- 
dom change in the ratio of the 
momentum to the position of a 
molecule — and Fleming doesn’t 
stumble upon penicillin. Lincoln 
decides not to go to the theater. Hit- 
ler attacks Stalingrad a month ear- 
lier. He was right; the world could 
change entirely. Of course, most 
changes would show on the surface, 
so you would be on your guard, but 
many might not. Best to leave it 
alone. 

Of course, if Elmo stayed inside 
a force field, as he said he would, 
there would be little danger. Still, I 
didn’t like it. 

So I wasn’t wildly enthusiastic 
two weeks later when he called to 
say he’d finished the machine. 

I went to his house. “C’mon,” 
he said, and I docilely followed him 
to an elevator which he’d fiendishly 
devised to drop at the right speed to 
make me just as airsick as I could 
get without messing up the inside of 
the elevator — though a couple of 
times I’ve fooled him. The fiend 
himself is immune to airsickness.

This time, though, he took it 
slowly, which put me on my guard. 
He apparently wanted me in a good 
mood. That meant he was going to 
try to persuade me to accept some- 
thing I shouldn’t, and that meant 
that he wasn’t as confident as he 
acted. He felt a need for my agree- 
ment. 

When we arrived at his 
laboratory — which by a whim of his 
was far underground — he led me 
through a maze of rooms to one I’d 
never been in. Almost the entire 
room was taken up by a large, un- 
tidy machine. 

“The alternate machine,’’ said 
Elmo unnecessarily. He pointed. 
“Controls. Vision screen. Computer 
terminal and display.’’ He slid back 
a panel in the machine, revealing a 
curved wall. He waved his hand 
across a photorelay and a section 
of the wall slid out and away. 
“Transmission field chamber.’’ He 
pointed to a hollow glass cylinder in 
the center of the chamber. “Trans- 
mission cylinder. I ride in the cyl- 
inder; the force field follows the 
lines of the chamber, but the 
chamber doesn’t go anywhere.’’ He 
walked to the control board. “Now 
I’ll show you how it works. What 
would you like to see?’’ 

A thought struck me. “Say. .if 
those worlds are almost exactly like 
ours — ’’ 

“They are, for the most part.” 

“ — then what you’ve got is the 
world’s worst eavesdropping 
gadget! The military would love 



this. Or the police — 1984 without 
being obvious. Or — ’’ 

“Or the busybody next door. A 
lot of people love a police state; it 
gives them an excusfe to spy on the 
neighbors. But don’t worry. I’m not 
about to turn it loose. Besides, it 
wouldn’t be much use to the mili- 
tary or paramilitary; you never know 
which parts of the alternate are the 
same and which are different, so the 
facts aren’t reliable. It’s a toy; no 
more.’’ 

“Well, come to that, what good 
is the transmission part of the 
machine?’’ 

He looked at me contemptuously. 
“You must be kidding. Look, 
stupid, a transfinite number of uni- 
verses means an unlimited supply of 
anything you’d care to mention.” 
He waved his arms. “Metals. Oil. 
Wood. Uranium. Anything!” He 
dropped his arms and scowled. 
“It’s so damn frustrating. I could 
go, I could get things and do 
things, except I’m afraid to.” 

I should have realized that was 
what was bothering him. Elmo isn’t 
the kind of person who likes to 
admit fear, and this being afraid of 
an intangible possibility of danger 
rather than a specific danger, was 
getting on his nerves. Hence his de- 
termination to finish and use the 
machine, thus removing the fear, 
and building his self-respect, by 
creating safety. Hence also my pres- 
ence; his fear made moral support 
desirable. 

Suddenly Elmo turned to the con- 



151 




trols. “But I asked you a question. 
What would you like to see first?” 
“Well, what’s the first thing you 
looked at when you got the screen 
hooked up?” 

“My home. I figured I’d be most 
able to see differences there.” 

“Your home. That figures. Okay, 
Narcissus, lay it on me, as they 
used to say.” 

He found my rooms and began 
flicking from alternate to alternate. I 
was in some of those pictures; it 
was an odd sensation, watching a 
duplicate of myself carry on his 
and, essentially, my life. After 
watching myself for a while, I 
began to feel acutely uncomfortable. 

“Some of those other me’s are 
somewhat peculiar. Okay, enough 
of my — God, what a hideous 
painting! — rooms, let’s see what the 
rest of the world — I mean worlds — I 
mean let’s see something else.” 
“Okay. It’d better be a city; no 
rural or suburban places have 
enough variety for us to be likely to 
hit on a change right off. ’ ’ 

“All right. How about New 
York?”, 

“You have no imagination. All 
right, New York it is.” 

He consulted his notebook and 
touched some contacts. “Voila 
Times Square.” He began jiggling 
the button, and the scene grew in- 
termittently peculiar. Not architec- 
ture too much, but clothing and 
shop windows. I mean, business- 
men in kilts? Grecian robes? Muk- 
luks? Shaved heads on women? 



Casual nudity — in churches and 
synagogues? 

“I thought they were supposed to 
keep their heads covered.” 

“Maybe they’re Reform.” 

“Doesn’t your machine pick up 
anything but extreme variants?” 

“These aren’t extreme. There’s 
no such thing as an extreme cloth- 
ing fashion. There’s nothing New 
Yorkers couldn’t get used to in a 
month.” 

I had to agree — especially after 
he focused on a rather attractive girl 
sitting on a bench, and took her all 
the way from nudity to heavy 
veils — without even changing her 
position. “If these are more or less 
average, then what are the ex- 
tremities like?” 

“Not much different. There’s 
only a finite number of ways 
clothes can be worn or not worn, 
given a certain level of technol- 
ogy.” 

“How about art, music, the the- 
ater?” 

“The same, at least for the mod- 
em stuff. Let’s see if we can find a 
museum and I’ll show you.” 

He chose one he was fond of vis- 
iting when in New York — or rather 
its duplicate. He panned through the 
doorway. The exhibits were not 
especially remarkable; in fact Elmo 
remarked that they were mostly ex- 
hibits he recognized as being in the 
museum in this world. 

Until. 

Elmo was reaching for the change 
button when he suddenly jumped 



152 




and backtracked. He centered the 
screen on a piece of sculpture which 
showed several very life-like statues 
of both sexes. They were engaged 
in activities hitherto considered in- 
appropriate to art galleries. 

I felt myself blushing. “Jeshua 
Hashimoto the Anointed,” I 
blurted. “I’m no prude, but — ’’ 
“Yes, you are. You always have 
been. Well, you wanted variety. 
I’m kind of out of touch with the 
museum, but I’m fairly sure that’s 
not in it.” He contemplated the 
statue for a few moments, and then 
said, “Maybe this alternate is going 
to be interesting after all. Let’s see 
what else the museum has.’’ 

He scanned down uninteresting 
corridors and past unspectacular ex- 
hibits until we reached a doorway 



flanked by guards. 

“High-security room,’’ he said. 
“That bastard.’’ 

“The room is a bastard?’’ 

“No, the last owner of that new 
Titian.” He gazed thoughtfully at 
the door. “Hmmm. You know, I 
never thought about it, but thi 
machine’d make the perfect getawa; 
vehicle. A criminal could disappeai 
completely in an instant, if he 
committed the crime in an alternate 
different from his own. The police 
couldn’t find him; he wouldn’t even 
exist in their world! And even if 
they could, he’d be outta their 
jurisdiction. Boy, would he be outta 
their jurisdiction!” 

That’s when I began to get un- 
easy. “What’re you thinking of?” I 
asked.

Though scientists once scoffed at Immanuel 
Velikovsky’s Worlds in Collision, space age 
discoveries reveal he may have been right 
after all. If so, much of what we thought we 
knew about the solar system and man's 
history must be reconsidered. 

Were ancient civilizations simultaneously 
destroyed at the time of the Biblical Exo- 
dus? Sifting through religious, mythical 
and astronomical records around the world, 
Velikovsky builds a case for overwhelming 
catastrophes within human memory. 
"Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered" 
examines the startling tale of Worlds in 
Collision and the equally disturbing efforts 
to suppress this book. Included are several 
special pieces by Velikovsky himself avail- 
able nowhere else.

“I tried to buy that painting for 
myself.” He sent the view through 
the door and towards the case con- 
taining the painting. ‘‘The owner 
wouldn’t let me have it, unless I’d 
agree to put it in a museum. He 
said it was ‘public property’ or 
something. But if I swipe this Ti- 
tian, I’ll have it and the public will 
have it too.” 

‘‘But the alternate universe peo- 
ple won’t have it!” 

‘‘My heart bleeds for the alter- 
nate universe people.” 

“But what about the guards 
. .the alarms. .what if there 
are automatic defenses?” 

“There are. Stunners set in the 
ceiling. But so what? The shield’s 
impermeable to anything but 
electro-magnetic radiation — so I’m 
safe unless someone’s carrying a 
laser, which ain’t likely.” He man- 
ipulated the controls. ‘‘It’ll be easy. 
Watch.” He opened a cabinet and 
pulled out a hammer. He then 
turned to the controls and touched a 
contact. He gave me an evil grin 
and entered the chamber. 

I had been groping for words 
without finding any. “Wait,” I said 
in desperation to the closing door, 
but as I expected Elmo paid no at- 
tention. Helplessly I turned back to 
the screen. 

Part of the picture shimmered, 
and Elmo and the cylinder appeared 
next to the display case. Elmo 
opened the cylinder, walked to the 
case, carefully broke the glass, 
picked up the painting, and returned 



to the cylinder and entered it. He 
grinned and thumbed his nose at 
someone I couldn’t see. As a light 
in the cylinder wall turned green, he 
touched a contact and vanished. 

A moment later he came out of 
the machine, the painting clutched 
in his hands. “I got it!” he crowed, 
and shoved the painting at me. I 
stepped back. “Here, look at it,” 
he said, and tossed it in my direc- 
tion. I juggled it frantically. 

“Elmo, be careful!” I begged. 
“These old paintings are fragile!” 

He snickered. “So what? I can 
always get a replacement.’’ He 
grabbed the painting back. 

“Elmo, I don’t like it. Send it 
back!” 

“Nothing doing! In fact. I’m 
going to see if I can’t find some- 
thing else worth stealing.” 

“NO! I mean. .Look, Elmo, at 
least do this, as a favor to me. Take 
the painting upstairs and put it in a 
safe place. Then stop and think for 
while before you go after anything 
else. Please!” 

“Well. Sure, why not. As a 
favor to you. But it won’t change 
my mind.” 

He shut down the machine and 
locked it, then took off through the 
maze of laboratories at a dead run. 
Like most children, he gets athletic 
when he’s excited. ITollowed, puff- 
ing. He got to the elevator before 
me and was waiting impatiently, as 
if it were he who wanted to escape 
the machine and I who wanted to 
remain. I stepped into the elevator. 



154 




and we shot upwards so fast I fell 
to my knees. I yelped, and Elmo 
uncomfortably tried to look unem- 
barrassed. When we got to his quar- 
ters, he was more subdued, but still 
cocky. He trotted to a painting on 
his wall and replaced it with the Ti- 
tian, then went to his bar, poured 
himself a drink, and flopped into a 
chair, incidentally spilling most of 
his drink in his lap. 

“So talk,’’ he said, wiping 
Scotch off of his pants. 

“Not while you’re in this 
mood.’’ I’d seen him that way be- 
fore; King Canute’s chances were 
better, there on the seashore. “Let’s 
wait till you calm down.” 

He grinned Satanically. “What 
makes you think I’m going to?” 
Desparation, that was what. 
“Tell you what: it’s after noon; this 
week’s Time will be out. I’ll read 
that, and then we’ll see if you listen 
to reason. Okay?” 

He was too busy admiring the Ti- 
tian to answer. 

I accepted that as a yes. I tuned 
in the trivee, decided on the Art 
section, dialed — and found myself 
staring at It. 

“Elmo,” I shrieked. “Look at 
this! The statue!” 

He glanced unconcernedly at the 
screen. “So what? Almost every- 
thing about that alternate was just 
like ours. Why not that?” 

“But you said art would be dif- 
ferent!” 

Hell, even I knew that was silly. 
Elmo looked at me scornfully. “I 



said likely to be different. I didn’t 
say it had to be. And remember, 
most of the other exhibits were the 
same as ours. 1 didn’t get excited 
about them; why should I get ex- 
cited about this?” He set down his 
drink and opened a panel in the 
chair-arm. “However, if it’ll make 
you feel better.” He punched for 
the Times, which, as a continuous- 
update paper, should already have 
had a bulletin about any museum 
robbery, unless the police were sit- 
ting on it. 

He got the front page and 
knocked his drink off the chair-arm. 
“MUSEUM ROBBED BY VAN- 
ISHING THIEF. Oh, God!” He 
looked at me wildly. “But that’s 
impossible. It’s not -a teleporter!” 

I read on in horrified fascina- 
tion. “Da Vinci, Rembrandt, El 
Greco. .Elmo, there’s a whole list 
of stuff here!” 

“What!? B-but I didn’t take any- 
thing but that Titian! You stopped 
me.” 

Dawn broke, blinding, and I 
burst out laughing. He stared at me 
in shocked disbelief, as if I’d 
poisoned his pet transistor. “You!” I 
gurgled. “I stopped you!” 

“Unhh. .no! Oh, no! Oh, no!” 
“Yes! Millions — an infinite 
number — a transfinite number of al- 
ternates, a transfinite number of 
Elmos robbing a transfinite number 
of museums! Of course there’s over- 
lap. Some of the robber universes 
are also robbee universes.” 

He groaned. “I won’t be able to 

155 




give the museum back its paintings, 
because I don’t have them — just the 
Titian!” 

“You could give the alternate 
museum back the Titian.” 

He shook his head miserably. “I 
can’t even do that. I turned off the 
machine; the alternate’s lost; I’ll 
never find it again.” He looked up 
at me, oddly. “Besides, why would 
I want to? What good would that 
do? What I really need to do. .” 
He started. “Sure! What I really 
need to do is go to the other alter- 
nates and steal replacements for the 
paintings the museum lost.” 

I sighed. “I figured you’d think 
of that. That’s why I suggested you 
send the painting back. The other 
Elmos — the robbers who are in uni- 
verses which are also victim- 
universes — the Elmos who find 
themselves in the same predicament 
as you — they’ll think of that too. 
And they’lll rob other universes for 
replacements, including some uni- 
verses containing Elmos who got 
away their thefts, and some with no 
theiving Elmos. And tha Elmos who 
get in trouble because of those 
thefts will also steal replacements. 
And it’ll go on. You — all of you 
— have started a series of troubles 
which will spread like ripples in a 
pond. God knows where it will 
end.” 

“But I have to. The guards will 
have seen me — him. My finger- 
prints’ll be on the case. The police 
will know who I am — mean who 
he was. Any minute now — ” 

156 



Right on cue, the doorbell rang. 

That wasn’t the end of it, of 
course. Elmo showed the police the 
machine and Told All, and in time it 
was decided that he might replace the 
stolen art treasures from other 
universes — a disturbing decision. 

Objets d’art continue to disappear 
from the museum, and Elmo con- 
tinues to replace them. Why do they 
disappear? Has some Elmo kept his 
machine running, zeroed in on us? 
Or are all the thefts by different 
altemate-Elmos? Some of the stolen 
goods were duplicates of previously 
stolen ones; would the same Elmo 
steal multiple copies? What is the 
ratio between Elmo-thieves and po- 
tential victim-universes? How does 
one divide trans-finite numbers? 

And that’s not the worst. We 
chose the Blakefield Museum by 
chance. In other places in the trans- 
finity of worlds, are there other 
Elmos who chose other museums? 
How long before the ripples of thiev- 
ery from those foci reach us? Will 
anything of value ever be safe 
again? And what about, those who 
aren’t just thieves? Elmo responded 
to greed and esthetics; were there 
others who responded to lust, 
sadism, hate, vengeance-longings? 

When Pandora opened the Box, 
she let a multitude of troubles into 
the world, but at the bottom of the 
Box was Hope. But the number of 
alternate worlds is transfinite 
— limitless. 

Elmo’s Box has no bottom. ★ 

GALAXY 





Dear Editor: 

Ursula Le Guin’s excellent and insightful 
essay on science fiction in the Dec. issue of 
Galaxy started me thinking about my own 
criterion for judging SF. While I still can’t 
give you a precise definition of what a truly 
great SF story ought to be, I do have some 
definite ideas about what makes a story fail. 
Here are some common pitfalls that I believe 
do mote than anything to relegate a story to 
the “not worth reading” class of literature: 

1. Fantastic gadgets and weird alien be- 
ings do not make a science fiction story un- 
less they are an integral part of the plot. 
How many times have I read a story whose 
only claim to being SF was the fact that it 
was set in the future or on some distant 
planet? If such a story could just as easily 
take place in modem day New York or San 
Francisco it’s not SF. 

2. Science fiction is, of course, fantasy. It 
is the mood of a story that engenders the 
sense of wonder and mystery that is so es- 
sential to any fantasy. Put modem slang in 
the mouths of characters supposedly living in 
the year 6000 A.D. or create starship cap- 
tains with the emotional control and mental- 
ity of ten year old boys and you destroy 
mood. 

3. Some theorizing in a SF story when of- 
fered as explanation is usually essential, but 
page after page of it makes the story tedious 
and demonstrates that the writer really 



doesn’t know where he’s going. 

Of the half dozen or so SF magazines on 
my local newsstand Galaxy is by far the 
best. On the whole the writers whose works 
appear in it steer clear of these pitfalls and 
produce superior fiction of absorbing in- 
terest. It’s this kind of Quality that keeps me 
coming back to Galaxy month after month 
and for it 1 thank you very much. 

Sincerely 
M. Bowen 

Santa Rosa, Cal. 

A letter to Galaxy’s Science Editor: 

Dear Dr. Poumelle, 

As I am sure you know, Larry Niven 
wrote a story (The Borderland of Sol) that 
featured quanmm black holes in the January 
’75 issue of Analog. I was practically poised 
with pen in hand to write to him when the 
January issue of Galaxy arrived and made 
my letter unnecessary. Your article answered 
my basic question — where was he getting his 
facts from? It seemed to me that only some- 
one who was actively engaged in relativity or 
astrophysics would be up to date on charged 
or quantum black holes, but it is clear after 
reading your article that you are both on top 
of recent developments. 

I would like to make one or two com- 
ments deriving from your remarks. First, 
Hawking’s result on the dissipation of small 
black holes because of quantum effects is 
discussed in Kip Thome’s recent article in 
Scientific American (The Search for Black 
Holes). However, he gives few details on the 
mass/lifetime relationship. It also seems as 
though there should be at least one good 
story involving energy extraction from the 
ergosphere of a rotating black hole, but I 
have not seen anything along these Unes — 
have I missed one? Roger Penrose origi- 
nated, or quoted, another interesting idea a 
few years ago — the use of the black hole as 
combined garbage disposal unit and energy 
source. Garbage in, a substantial proportion 
of the rest mass out, as radiation. Ecology 
buffs might object, since recycling presents 
apparently insuperable problems. Just about 

157 




everything thought or written about black 
holes is either described or referenced in 
Misner, Thome and Wheeler’s magnum opus 
“Gravitation”, current up to about mid- 
’73 — including the real problems that sin- 
gularities present in relativity. These sin- 
gularities imply that classical general relativ- 
ity has to be an incomplete theory, and most 
people look to some form of quantization as 
essential — what Wheeler referred to some 
years ago as the ’fiery marriage of general 
relativity with quantum physics’. (Hawking’s 
paper on small black holes introduces a few 
quantum mechanical concepts, but does not 
perform the fundamental re-shaping that 
seems to be needed. Hawking and Ellis, in 
their book “The Large Scale Structure of 
Space-Time”, clearly outline the problem). 

Looking forward to more stories and arti- 
cles on wormholes, naked singularities, 
Kerr-Newman black holes and other de- 
licacies from you. 

Sincerely, 
Charles Sheffield 

6812 Wilson Lane, 

Bethesda, Maryland 

Jerry’s reply follows: 

Thanks for yours of December 27. 

Yes, 1 was aware of the material in 
Thome’s article and the book he did with 
Wheeler and Misner. A couple of years ago 
Kip gave a lecture at Cal Tech on Black 
Holes, and Larry Niven and 1 attended it — 
that’s what got us interested at the time. 
Since 1 have press credentials it was easy 
enough to get a long interview with Thome 
later, and also another with Lee and Light- 
man, two post-doctoral students at Cal Tech 
who did a lot of the actual work on the 
Thome project. 

They were assigned the task of taking all 
experimental evidence known and trying to 
discard one or another of the relativity 
theories. As you may have heard, not only 
couldn’t they eliminate any of the better cur- 
rent theories — but they were also able to 
come up with their own equations. 

They also told me that in Lee-Lightman 



theory it is possible to send messages — but 
not material objects — at speeds faster than 
light. 

If it is possible, the implications ate pro- 
found, and even if Lee-Lightman theory is 
wrong, the fact that we’ve got a theoretical 
model not inconsistent with any experimental 
data that allows FTL communication is one 
of the most exciting developments 1 can 
imagine. 

Best, 

Jerry Poumelle 

PS: If I can get out from under deadlines — 
including rush jobs for a certain galactic 
magazine editor [Ahem — Ed.], I’ve got a 
dilly of a black hole story I’m writing . 

Another letter to the Science Editor: 

Dear Mr. Poumelle; 

I have just finished reading your article in 
the November Galaxy, concerning memory. 
At the risk of boring you to death, I will 
now submit an unsubstantiated hypothesis 
which I have about memory, and ask you if 
it fits with your holographic theory. 

To begin with, 1 discovered that most of 
the people with whom I could relate intellec- 
tually had a memory which went back to the 
age of two. By contrast, most of the people I 
could relate to only superficially could not 
remember much before the age of five. 

The main visible difference was that the 
people who could remember their early 
childhood tended to form their own hypoth- 
eses, while the people who could not re- 
member tended to accept one of two conflict- 
ing theories on any subject. For example, 
most of the people I knew who accepted the 
theory of a specific “New Left” group could 
not remember beyond age five, while most 
of the “independent” Leftists could re- 
member to age two. 

On the basis of this small sample, I 
formed the folllowing hypothesis: 

Since the variation in the age of earliest 
memories runs from two to (in a few cases) 
eight, it was unlikely that it could be 
explained by any biological variation at the 
time the memories were recorded. It was

GALAXY 




more likely that the variation was caused by 
a difference in mental patterns which de- 
veloped later. 

Since children have a very different view 
of what they see than adults, the main prob- 
lem in remembering would be to relate the 
object which was observed at an early age 
(when it had a totally different meaning) to 
the object as it would be observed by an 
adult. For example, a person who thought of 
old people as having great wisdom when a 
child, and who thought of them as senile as 
an adult might have two completely different 
symbols for the old people he saw at differ- 
ent times, and be unable to relate the two. 

If the individual had discarded his child- 
hood view of reality and accepted the view 
of the adults around him (as someone dis- 
cards his previous view when he accepts a 
new scientific or political theory), he would 
tend to forget how he had thought in the past 
and be unable to decode his early memories. 
If, on the other hand, his present view of re- 
ality had evolved from his early view, 
through the gradual integration of adult con- 
cepts, he would still be able to understand 
his earlier way of thinking or — more 
likely — would have converted his earlier 
memories to his new way of thinking as his 
mind evolved. 

My guess is that the shift from a continu- 
ally evolving, integrative mind to a 
“pattern-accepting” mind occurrs as a result 
of our type of education, in which learning is 
divorced from direct observation. The indi- 
vidual variation would, logically, be ac- 
counted for by differences in age and intelli- 
gence at the time children start to assimilate 
large amounts of information in school. 

This hypothesis conforms with the ob- 
served fact that early memories can be re- 
vived through hypnotic age regression, which 
returns an individual to the general under- 
standing of reality which he had at an earlier 
age. Also, Buddhism asserts that people can- 
not remember their childhood, or their previ- 
ous lives, because of their attachment. 

I would be interested to hear if this 
hypothesis is in conformity with your holo- 
graphic theory. Possibly, some people retain a 
sin^e system of encoding memories while. 



in others, the encoding system is broken at a 
particular age. 

Thank you. 

Truly yours, 
George Beiler

Dear Mr. Beiler, 

I’m not entirely sure the holographic 
theory is “mine”, in the sense that I agree 
with it. It’s certainly not mine in the sense of 
originating it. 

I don’t see any obvious conflict between 
the holographic brain model and your own 
view. I suspect your theory would make a 
good Ph.D. dissertation for some psychology 
student, and might result in a pretty good 
book as well. I’ve seen worse books pub- 
lished about sillier ideas. 

Whether or not we accept the holographic 
brain model, the evidence for dynamic as 
opposed to fixed memory storage gets 
stronger every day. Just last week I heard 
that at least part of the evidence for chemical 
memory — namely the experiment in which 
flatworms were fed to others, and the new 
ones seemed to get some of the previous 
Worms’s memories — had collapsed. Like 
polywater, at least some of the results were 
due to dirty laboratory glassware. 

Best, 

Jerry Pournelle 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

1 agree with Alter (Alien Viewpoint- 
December IF). The so-called intellectual SF 
is a rip-off and a bore. Reading a discon- 
nected backwards nightmare of a novel is not 
my idea of good SF or good anything. In- 
stead let’s see more authors using science in 
fiction and writing so we can all understand 
their point of view. 

I enjoy both Galaxy and If — hope the new 
combined magazine will be as good. 

Peace, 
Christie Cecil
