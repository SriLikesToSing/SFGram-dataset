To go anywhere on Earth took 
next to no time and cost 
nothing — if Earth survived! 



Interface A 

Theseus 

Blinded by the dark 
Followed Ariadne's clue of 
thread 

Ariadne 

Has ceased her spinning 
And all doors lead to the 
Minotaur 

— Mustapha Sharif 



66T OOK ou t!” 

I j Thinking, in that instant of 
chill due as much to the change of 
excitement into alarm as to the step 
he and the Arab had taken from 
subtropical to subarctic, how ab- 



5 




surd it was for him to blurt those 
words to a blind man. But Musta- 
pha was accustomed to his lack 
after — how long? Fifteen years, 
fifty? It was not something one in- 
quired about. 

The Arab complied, tensing into 
that strange state of total attention 
which, Hans Dykstra had some- 
times imagined, could truly halt the 
passage of the blind one’s personal 
time and poise him an arm’s length 
away from the world experienced 
by ordinary people while he took 
exhaustive, unseeing stock of it. 

That, too, made Hans shiver de- 
spite his climatized suit. 

And then he realized — of course! 
Cobwebs! 

He forced himself to take a deep 
breath and fear subsided as icy air 
seeped through his mask. There 
was no light here except from the 
powerful hand torch he had 
brought and the very first thing he 
had seen as he arrived had been 
gray fluff-thickened strands bar- 
ring his exit from the skelter. 

Illegal it might be, but one did 
hear stories now and then about 
people who couldn’t afford a priva- 
teer and rigged mantraps of their 
own devising. 

“I sense no one,” Mustapha said 
in a voice not quite tinged with 
complaint. The eagerness that 
drove him had nothing in common 
with his companion’s — at least 
none the latter could recognize. 
They were collaborators, but they 
were not and could not be partners. 
One might say, The enemy of my 
enemy . And be able to proceed 
no further with an explanation. 

Hans uttered the necessary words 



and into the fringe of the lamp’s 
beam instantly rose a brown hand, 
child-chubby as Mustapha’s face, 
groping greedily for the spider’s 
fragile legacy. 

“Wait, wait — " Hans implored, 
thrusting away the blue flower, the 
speedwell, which of course he had 
held up before him when he had 
entered the skelter. He hastened 
through the regular protective 
charms in his mind, meantime 
using one hand to sweep the visible 
portion of the house with his lamp 
and keeping the other alert to 
punch a getaway code should some- 
one turn out to be already in pos- 
session. Such caution was very 
likely superfluous — an assurance 
from Mustapha was worth a dozen 
instrument readings. But since 
neither the radiation counter nor 
the bio-assay unit had beeped, the 
place was obviously habitable, and 
it had been long since one stopped 
to ask polite questions of strangers 
who showed up unannounced in a 
domestic skelter. 

“Why wait?” Mustapha de- 
manded querulously. “Because you 
can see a warning sign?” 

With a sigh Hans abandoned his 
mental formulae before comple- 
tion. “No,” was his gruff answer. 
“Because when you touch the webs 
you’ll break them and I want to get 
them on film first.” 

He unslung his camera and flash 
to record the delicate tracery 
marred with thickening dust. 

“Keep your hand out of the 
shot,” he added, eye glued to the 
viewfinder. “Want to get yourself 
braced?” 

“They will not find your pictures 



6 



GALAXY 




until they’re meant to — after you’re 
dead. So at least you originally 
promised me.” 

“I could be dead, but you could 
still be alive.” Hans grunted and 
wound the film on. “Good, two will 
be enough. Go ahead.” 

P lump fingers moved in air with 
the slyness of some stalking 
creature, located a web strand, felt 
along it with the precision of a mu- 
sician’s tracing out a melody. With- 
out breaking the strand they found 
another — broke both in a deliberate 
gesture and savored the sensation 
of contact. Hans had witnessed 
Mustapha performing similar mar- 
vels before, but this was the most 
amazing. To stroke the full length 
of that spider silk and leave it intact 
until the moment of his decision to 
snap it — such abilities sometimes 
made the Arab seem inhuman. 

But there was no room in 
Dykstra's mind right now for re- 
flection, only for reaction. This 
time — no doubt about it — Musta- 
pha had done him proud. Hans had 
guessed from the form of the code 
he had bought that the find was 
exceptionally early and had dared 
to hope it might lie in the first 
million. On site, he was immediate- 
ly ready to believe they had located 
one in the first hundred thousand, 
assuming that this was Scandi- 
navia — and everything pointed to 
it. The air was certainly cold 
enough and facing him across the 
living zone were big windows, abso- 
lutely black, silent witnesses of a 
northern night. 

“Oh, wow,” he said under his 
breath. The phrase was archaic. 



but English was not his mother 
tongue and anyhow, if someone 
had invented a better way to ex- 
press delighted astonishment he 
hadn’t heard about it. Under the 
obliterating dust the floor looked 
like natural wood parquet. Draped 
with cobwebs, that might be an au- 
thentic Hille chair. Weren’t those 
shelves System Cado?. 

“It pleases you?” Mustapha 
murmured, his study of the webs 
complete. At once he had reverted 
to his regular manner — cool, de- 
tached, as though he were a 
machine programed to acquire and 
analyze with maximum concentra- 
tion all new data that presented 
themselves, to idle in the face of 
any precedented situation. This 
was the ninth time he and Hans 
had come together to a lost home. 
How his companion obtained the 
codes to reach them Hans had no 
idea and intended never to ask, for 
fear of being told that the two of 
them were relying on some ancient 
“little black book” rather than 
some burgled bank of computer 
records, or bribery of a technician 
at the Skelter Authority. 

And the Arab went on, “I 
apologize for being overly eager to 
touch the webs. But they are so rare 
now. I had not felt one since boy- 
hood. I had almost forgotten them. 
Curious! One would have expected 
spiders to be tough.” 

Yes, perhaps, Hans thought. But 
infection had come out of Central 
America — a fungus or some micro- 
scopic parasite — and something 
had kept happening to their 
eggs . Well, one would also at 
one time have imagined that hu-

manity was tough. 

Aloud he said, “I think this 
strike is the best yet.” 

Cozy in his suit, he drew down 
his mask and inhaled the harsh air 
with paradoxical enjoyment. It was 
cruel to the throat, but it tasted 
infinitely cleaner than what he had 
left minutes ago. That had been 
tainted with the sewer stench of the 
Mediterranean and the collective 
halitosis of Valletta. The dust 
merely added spice to its tang. 

Unencumbered with equipment, 
Mustapha had walked forward out 
of range of the handlamp’s beam to 
stand on the level floor and turn, as 
though on a slowly revolving 
potter’s wheel, soaking in the 
nonvisual information the house 
could afford him. Once or twice he 
clapped loudly, cocking his head, 
mapping walls and doorways and 
furniture, sniffing the while, mem- 
orizing new scents. 

More slowly and a little enviously 
(but to envy a man who had been 
blinded was crazy!) Hans also 
emerged from the skelter, hung 
about with safety devices, camera, 
flash-bar, bag of spare film, lamp, 
instruments. It was all gear legiti- 
mately come by, but there was 
nothing legitimate about the use to 
which he was at present putting it. 

His profession was that of a re- 
cuperator — his duty was to share 
out reclaimed resources around the 
world to those who were in greatest 
need of them or who could exploit 
them for the general good. It wasn’t 
the lure of strange places that had 
enticed him to take up his dan- 
gerous and unlawful hobby, for he 
was routinely instructed to go to 



every continent as and when a re- 
claimable cache was reported to the 
Economics Authority. 

No, what fascinated him was the 
form and pattern of a dead age, in 
suspended animation now but be- 
ing gnawed by time so rapidly that, 
unless someone made a record of it 
less tenuous than memory could 
provide, its relics would have to be 
reconstructed in ignorance by the 
archeologists of the far future. 

If there were any. 

T he skelter here was indeed one 
of the very earliest, a half-cen- 
tury old and amazingly bulky, as 
big as a car. He understood that 
some car parts had in fact been 
adapted for the first skelters, just 
as Remington had included bits 
from sewing machines in its origi- 
nal typewriters. So old a model 
might be developing faults. The 
thing had delivered him and the 
Arab here safely, but would it send 
them away again? Worst of all — 
would it take Mustapha away 
(leaving first, as always, his own in- 
comprehensible curiosity satisfied) 
and then maroon him — maroon 
Hans Dykstra? 

For an instant he pictured him- 
self trudging across the snowbound 
wastes of . What country was 
this anyhow? Sweden? Norway? 
Finland? Most likely Sweden — 
there was a Volvo plate on the 
skelter’s crystal box, rimed with 
frost but legible. An almost vacant 
land, then. The winter population 
of Sweden was reputed to be down 
to around two, three thousand now, 
mostly eccentric recluses, so hunt- 
ing on foot for help in getting home

GALAXY 




would be absurd. In the summer, 
of course, things were different. 
There might be a million temporary 
residents by July. 

He contemplated the skelter 
gloomily. Like most people nowa- 
days — or rather, like most privi- 
leged people — he could undertake 
simple routine maintenance on his 
own model of skelter — work equiv- 
alent to changing a car tire or a tap 
washer — but he had never seen a 
design this old before. If he were to 
start making inquiries about ser- 
vice manuals for obsolete Volvo 
skelters, though, within the day 
some bland official would track 
him down to ask what need he had 
for such data. And Hans had 
absolutely no desire to land a 
bracelet for code-breaking. No, he 
would have to put his faith in the 
high standard of Swedish crafts- 
manship, take his chances of being 
disintegrated on the way to or from 
home — or of being stuck here until 
summer gave him the chance to 
mingle with a mass of visitors at a 
public skelter outlet. 

It wouldn’t be impossible to sur- 
vive here for a while. It might even 
be fun — in a way. Novel, at any 
rate. He had never experienced 
such solitude as this lonely north- 
ern land promised. He had walked 
all around the living zone by now — 
his heels on the hard parquet af- 
fording Mustapha the sonic reflec- 
tions he needed to build his 
chiropteran picture of their sur- 
roundings — and located the kit- 
chen. Apart from the packs of food 
in the freezer — which obviously he 
would not dare touch, since they 
had been thawed and refrozen 



countless times — there was a huge 
store of canned goods. And if that 
wall gauge was to be relied on — 
hadn’t just jammed at a false read- 
ing — there were almost a thousand 
liters of oil in the heating tank. 

On the other hand, Dany would 
report him missing at once and the 
authorities would promptly start 
turning the skelter system inside 
out in search of a fault that might 
have destroyed him in transit. 
There weren’t so many human 
beings left you could afford to have 
them disappear at random — the 
days when, if they heard about 
them, most people regarded a 
million deaths with equanimity, a 
mere garnish to breakfast, were 
over. And the last thing Hans 
wanted was official notice attracted 
to himself. He would simply have to 
pray that the skelter would last out 
another dozen cycles. 

By way of insurance he retrieved 
his speedwell and placed it incon- 
spicuously in a corner of the 
machine. That was a safe token to 
leave — its name had made the 
pretty little blue flower the com- 
monest of all life symbols to take 
with you on a journey. 

Then, pushing such considera- 
tions to the back of his mind, he 
photographed the living zone, then 
the kitchen, then the sauna he dis- 
covered beyond, shooting to avoid 
the tracks he and Mustapha had 
left in the dust as clear as in new 
snow. 

Next he came to a small study 
with an open bureau bearing a 
Halda typewriter, documents in 
pigeonholes, a pile of dusty corres- 
pondence paper, which he blew at 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE

gently until the name and address 
were legible. From it he learned 
that the house’s owners had been 
called Eriksson, that he and Mus- 
tapha were indeed in Sweden — near 
a place called Umea which he 
would have to look up on a map 
when he got home — and something 
else which struck him as literally 
incredible. 

The skelter code was printed on 
the letterhead! 

Interlace B 

O my beloved, I offer you my 
heart 

To eat as you would bite a pome- 
granate — 

But beware. 

A human heart holds seeds like 
a pomegranate 

And some are sweet but more 
are poisonous — 

We have seen much death, 
you and I. 

— Mustapha Sharif 

almost he snatched up the entire 
pile, thinking to dump it on 
the big open hearth of the living 
zone and set light to it. He checked 
his hand an inch from the paper in 
the same moment he heard Musta- 
pha’s cool query: “Hans, is some- 
thing wrong?” 

“No — nothing,” he answered 
with an effort. True enough. He 
had imagined something was, but 
the reaction stemmed from habit. 
Even if Mustapha were going to 
charge him twenty thousand for the 
code that was here repeated scores 
of times, he didn’t need to fear the 
loss of his monopoly. Years had 



gone by without anyone’s finding 
the way here — until now. Most 
likely as long again would pass 
before other feet smutched this 
floor. Those numbers were simply — 
numbers. 

No, wait. They were something 
more, after all. A symbol — a key 
symbol — of that strange and far-off 
world of the recent past he was 
struggling to capture and preserve 
for posterity. A good clear picture 
of the paper, or better yet an actual 
sheet of it, would have to be 
included in his final report. 

“You exclaimed,” Mustapha 
said obstinately. “It must have 
been for a cause. You have found a 
clue to the fate of the former occu- 
pants?" 

A shadow of ghoulish hunger lay 
on his words, familiar to Hans from 
their previous expeditions together. 
(How had they managed to become 
open with each other that first 
time? Hans had tried over and over 
to reconstruct the details in his 
memory. He was sure of only one 
fact, that Mustapha had been the 
one to broach their teaming up. 
Himself, he would not have dared. 
Nor, in a sense, had Mustapha 
“dared.” He had determined that 
trips such as this could be safely 
undertaken. There had been some- 
one before, another man — or pos- 
sibly a woman — who had traveled 
with him to forgotten lonely homes 
and added those details necessary 
to comprehension of the whole that 
a visitor without sight could not 
provide for himself. But Mustapha 
had never spoken of the fate of 
Hans’s predecessor.) 

Curtly Hans explained now — his

GALAXY 




head buzzing with plans for later 
visits — the need for cleaning ma- 
terials, floodlights, reference books 
about the culture of the country 
fifty years ago to explain the pur- 
pose of the mysterious gadgets such 
as he knew from experience he was 
bound to find, dictionaries to help 
him puzzle out a few of the letters 
and the shopping list he had seen 
scrawled on a memo board in the 
kitchen . 

But when he came back he would 
come alone. For the moment he 
owed Mustapha something more 
than the mere money that would by 
then have changed hands — in re- 
turn, of course, for another volume 
of the Arab’s poetry, hand-illumi- 
nated and magnificently cal 1 i - 
graphed but to Hans totally incom- 
prehensible. Hans understood no 
Arabic, but the frequent purchases 
he made from Mustapha to cover 
up the transfer of the large sums he 
shelled out for illegal skelter codes 
excited no remark. Little new 
beauty was being brought into the 
modern world and what there 
was — was precious. A score of 
other people patronized Mustapha 
even more generously and without 
ulterior motive. 

Even Dany, who was resentful of 
the money her husband chose not 
to spend on her, had been im- 
pressed enough by the delicately il- 
lustrated books, lively with red and 
blue and real gold-leaf, to believe 
that he was buying them as a safe 
investment for their old age. 

M ustapha was talking. Hans 
compelled /composed himself 
to hear the words. 



Ballantine 

Books 

1974 may well be remembered as the year 
of Alan Dean Foster, or so It Is beginning to 
seem here at Ballantine where we have three 
of his books scheduled within five months. 
Not bad for a young writer whose very first 
book was published as recently as 1972. Just 
off the press Is LLi ANA, Alan’s adaptation 
of the jungle extravaganza now playing In 
movie theaters around and about the 
country. Lunna, something of a female 
Tarzan, and her family — a lion, a tiger, and 
a chimp — are vividly brought to life on the 
cover by the Inimitable Frazetta. Watch for 
LIJANA; she's a gal you’re not likely to 
forget! 

Alan’s other books already scheduled In- 
clude: ICER1GGER, a March sf adventure 
In which he returns to the marvelously 
imaginative galaxy of his first novel THE 
TAR-AIYM k RANG; and In June STAR 
TREK LOG ONE, first book In a series 
based on the successful new animated Star 
Trek series. But much more about those two 
as they are published. 

For his next project Alan has suggested 
scripting “Deep Thoat” — an X-rated Bar- 
soom adventure. Hmmm .

awards are voted. “Not only are the prose,

Back to the top of our sf list is NERVES, 
Lester del Rey’s now-classic tale of disaster 
in an atomic plant. First written In 1942, 
this story of a nuclear reaction bursting out 
of control Is even more devastating today. 
What starts out as an ordinary experiment 
on an ordinary day turns Into a race to 
prevent atomic holocaust. As fuel supplies 
evaporate everywhere and we begin to look 
more to atomic power for our energy, we 
come closer and closer to the world del Rey 
wrote about. Now In its fourth big printing, 
NERVES Is still a must for every sf reader. 
“A wholly admirable blend of prophetic 
thinking, warm human values and powerful 
narrative suspense,” said the New York 
Herald Tribune reviewer. Need we say 
more?

“There is a little smell of death, 
but it is so faint it is more likely to 
issue, I think, from food that has 
rotted through several summers 
and been frozen again. Those docu- 
ments — they tell us where we are. 
Do they also hint at what became of 
the people who lived here?” 

Forgetful, Hans shook his head. 
Mustapha was looking at him 
directly and his eyes were bright in 
the lamp’s beam. It was not the 
eyes that were at fault but the 
nerves that served them. At first 
Hans had suspected that the poet 
had been lying about being blind. 

Recovering almost at once, he 
said, “No, but we can dismiss fall- 
out, I think. This area must have 
been well out of range of the big 
blasts at Kiruna and Trondjhem.” 
Reflexively he confirmed his 
statement with a glance at his 
radiation counter, even though it 
had remained silent. At most 
places he went to in the line of duty 
it beeped incessantly and he had to 
sort through weathered industrial 
junk, hampered as much by the 
distracting noise as by his lead-im- 
pregnated suit. 

“One would have expected that, 
yes,” Mustapha murmured. “Dis- 
ease, possibly? So many epidemics 
were imported here by the skelter. 
There are other rooms. For the 
sake of your ‘after’ pictures. Hans, 
you go into them first.” 

With an ironical little bow. 
Sourly Hans complied, mentally 
agreeing with the other’s guess- 
work. Sickness after killing sick- 
ness had exploded like shrapnel 
from the few surviving reservoirs in 
less fortunate areas of the world

into those whose inhabitants had 
neglected immunization procedures 
as needless. Which one — of the 
many that had come this way — had 
carried off the Erikssons? Plague? 
Diphtheria? Cholera? Rabies? 
Smallpox? 

No, none of these. Violence. 

In the small room adjacent to the 
study a child’s skeleton lay in bed. 
The coverlet had been soaked with 
blood, urine and excrement and 
finally with the liquid foulness of 
rotting flesh. It had dried into a 
hard loathsome lump. 

“Ah,” Mustapha said with the 
air of a man whose favorite sus- 
picion has been confirmed. “I take 
it we have stumbled on an actual 
body?” 

Hans swallowed against nausea, 
though it was far from the first time 
he had chanced across similar 
horrors. He lowered the camera 
with which he had been ready to 
take one of what Mustapha scath- 
ingly referred to as his “after” pic- 
tures. Customarily what he did at 
each of these lost homes was, as it 
were, reverse the effects of time. He 
recorded on his arrival the state 
into which the passage of years had 
reduced the place — then, with 
much care and labor, he would re- 
store it to something resembling 
what it must have looked like when 
it had been in regular occupation. 

But a scene like this? No, he 
didn’t want it included in his re- 
port. 



N ow, with that incredible de- 
personalized interest Hans at 
first had privately termed callous- 



ness but now knew to be something 
his vocabulary furnished no name 
for, Mustapha slipped past him, lo- 
cated the bed, ran his hands lightly 
over the disgusting mass until they 
discovered the skull. 

, “A child,” he said. “Boy? Girl?” 

Hans surveyed the room, torch 
beam dancing wildly on the irregu- 
lar surfaces of a table, a closet, a 
shelf of toys and books with 
brightly colored pictures. On a 
chairback, casually deposited, two 
pathetic scraps of cloth, the parts 
of a bikini. 

“Girl.” 

“And young, by the size. Ten? 
Twelve?” 

“More likely ten. As far as I can 
guess from the toys and books 
without disturbing them.” 

He thought in passing: funny, 
one had the impression that Swedes 
were casual about their bodies, that 
a child so young would be let run 
naked. But perhaps, like so many 
other preconceptions, it was a trick 
of perspective. Around the Medi- 
terranean what had been believed 
about Swedes in the old days — fifty 
years ago — would logically have 
been based on the atypical behavior 
of expatriates. 

A hall of distorting mirrors. The 
whole Earth had been turned into 
one — and sometimes the distortions 
had been accepted for reality. It 
was going to be an infinitely long, 
infinitely painful task to set the 
consequences right. 

“Perhaps in the adjacent room, 
then,” Mustapha said, “we shall 
find traces of her parents. Lead the 
way again, if you please.” 

There, in the master bedroom,

were two more skeletons, one 
sitting up in a twin bed, the other 
sprawled on the floor nearby, ad- 
herent to the ruin of an Iceland- 
pony rug. Among the shreds of 
dried ancient meat clinging to the 
ribs it could be seen that the latter’s 
breastbone and one shoulderblade 
had been shattered. Also, on the 
wall backing the scene, there was a 
pit such as might be made by a de- 
formed and tumbling bullet. 

Taking Hans's arm in a light 
grip, not to be tightened — his 
fingers were dreadfully strong — un- 
less his companion tried to shake it 
off, Mustapha demanded a de- 
scription in vivid detail before 
crossing the threshold and at once 
began to compile an explanation. 

“Ah, it comes clear. They were 
too casual with their skelter code, 
because in those days possession of 
a skelter was something to boast 
about. One midnight they were 
awakened by the arrival signal and 
the intruder proved to be a thief — ” 

“Not a thief,” Hans cut in, dully 
pleased at being able to make the 
contradiction. “A thief would have 
ransacked the house for money and 
valuables, left drawers and closets 
open everywhere. There’s no more 
disorder than you’d expect in a 
lived-in home with a child around.” 

“Someone who didn’t come here 
to steal, then,” Mustapha accept- 
ed, unperturbed. “But who wanted 
his presence kept secret even at the 
cost of three lives. A spy or 
saboteur — even a whole gang of 
saboteurs.” 

“People playing skelter rou- 
lette?” Hans offered, hoping for a 
second chance to edit his com- 



panion’s intuitive analysis. 

“No, that’s too recent a phenom- 
enon. By the time that fad caught 
on the family living here would 
have scrapped the notepaper with 
the code on it — perhaps, if they 
were rich enough, installed a priva- 
teer, because it was about then that 
privateers started to come on the 
market. But I gathered that the 
skelter is an extremely old model?” 
“Yes.” 

“Very well, I believe in my sabo- 
teurs. Memory reports some kind 
of industry at Umea — it was a city 
of moderate importance, a con- 
vincing target.” 

He stood silent for a long mo- 
ment, inhaling through flared nos- 
trils, then unexpectedly turned on 
his heel. Hans asked, unconsciously 
rubbing the spot on his arm where 
those deceitfully gentle fingers had 
rested, “You’re leaving already?” 
“Yes. Thank you for your assis- 
tance. I have what I came for. I 
wish you success in garnering what 
you came for, too.” 

“When — when shall I see you 
again?” 

“When I have something else to 
offer that’s just as good.” With an 
enigmatic smile. “Which may not 
be soon, but then — this site should 
occupy you for quite a while, no? 
So I shan’t hurry. Well, goodbye, 
and thanks again.” 

There was a question Hans al- 
ways wanted to ask at this moment 
of separation — was he Mustapha’s 
sole customer for illegal codes? 
Now, once again, it trembled on his 
lips but remained unuttered. There 
was a faint wash of blue light from 
the skelter. He was alone.

almost at once other thoughts 
/\were chased from Hans’s mind 
by a surge of relief at his being able 
to get ahead so quickly with his 
main task. The more he studied the 
house the more convinced he be- 
came that, restored to its pristine 
condition, it was going to be the 
star of his secret collection of words 
and pictures which — as Mustapha 
had reminded him — no one else 
must learn of until after his death. 

Then generations yet unborn 
would bless his foresight and dedi- 
cation to the cause of history. If 
news of what he was doing leaked 
out while he was still alive, though, 
he would undoubtedly be braced, 
no matter how high his motives. 
There were few absolutes left on 
Earth. The right to conceal a 
private skelter code had to be 
among them. 

Well, he could now stop theoriz- 
ing about the Erikssons’ fate and 
get rid of their remains. Not too 
soon, either. Nearly two-thirds of 
the population of the planet had 
been killed by violence or disease 
within twenty years of the market- 
ing of the first skelters and, as 
though they felt chilly in the 
shadow of that tidal wave of death, 
men now were paranoid about the 
presence of corpses. 

Hans was not immune. 

Luckily — in the course of his 
regular work — he had gained ac- 
cess to garbage-disposal codes that 
ensured delivery straight to the hot 
heart of a furnace. Presumably 
such codes had not existed when 
the Erikssons were killed, or the in- 
truder would have bundled up the 
bodies along with the blood-stained

bedding and rugs, made the beds 
afresh and left the house looking as 
though the owners had dropped 
down to the tropics for a few days 
and might return at any moment. 
Exactly as Hans planned to do now. 

He felt fortunate that he didn’t 
have to buy his garbage codes. 
They came expensive. They had to. 
They made it so easy to destroy the 
evidence of crime, especially mur- 
der. 

He decided to attend to the chore 
right now instead of delaying it 
until his next visit. Used though he 
was to entering long-abandoned 
premises legitimately in the course 
of his profession — though never 
private homes, only factories and 
warehouses — and finding not two 
or three bodies but great piles of 
them, sometimes charred a little by 
pyres the earlier survivors had been 
too weak to keep burning, Hans 
found he hated the idea of coming 
back to this house that once must 
have been very beautiful and find- 
ing corpses in residence. They 
would make him feel like a tres- 
passer. 

He didn’t bother to rehearse any 
prayers as he consigned the bodies 
to the skelter. In Northern Europe 
these people would presumably 
have been either atheist — in which 
case they wouldn’t have cared — or 
Christian. As a moderately devout 
follower of the Way of Life Hans re- 
garded Christianity with the same 
revulsion he felt for black magic. 

Let their evil lord claim his own. 

W hen the distasteful task was 
over he relaxed and spent a 
long while roaming from room to 



room of the house, everywhere 
finding new objects to photograph, 
carefully pick up and marvel at. 
This family, probably not excep- 
tionally prosperous, had been able 
to buy and use objects that today 
would fetch a small fortune in the 
antiques market. He found a 
camera better and more costly than 
his own, a range of long-playing 
records in a sealed cabinet with a 
glass door. Any of these items 
would attract bids from a hundred 
eager buyers. He discovered cloth- 
ing of virtually imperishable syn- 
thetic fiber from which the dust fell 
away to reveal the brilliance of un- 
faded dyes as he lifted it. And more 
and still more whichever way he 
turned . 

Abruptly he realized that his fin- 
gers and toes were growing numb 
despite his climatized garb. And 
his throat was stiffening, sure sign 
of incipient frost-dehydration. 
There was, he remembered, a ther- 
mometer apparently in working 
order on the wall of the kitchen. 
When he consulted it he discovered 
with alarm that he had been 
blithely wandering around at minus 
twenty Celsius. 

Time for home. When he came 
back he must bring a heater.

But it is a truth important

Others say "rout” which means 
“to put to flight" 

And oddly also “to pull up by

It is as though the genius of their

— Mustapha Sharif 

T o possess two private skelters 
was not unheard-of. To own 
three was remarkable, but certain 
successful persons, mostly working 
for the planetary authorities, had 
attained that goal and shuttled 
back and forth between three 
homes. 

To own three sited all in the same 
building, even though the building 
was large and sprawled into many 
shady colonnades, white-glittering 
domes, towers of marble and courts 
where lizards darted at the feet of 
priceless statues — that was unique. 
And their equally unique proprietor 
was the man who, some declared, 
was the greatest living poet: Musta- 
pha Sharif. 

But if someone said as much in 
his hearing he would wryly observe 
that there was very little compe- 
tition nowadays. 

Possession of his third skelter — 
high in a minaret where five times 
daily an elderly and arthritic muez- 
zin came to call to prayer those of 
the local people who had not been 
seduced into following the infidel 
creed, the Way of Life — was not an 
achievement he advertised. The 
world might assume the existence 
of the first skelter — so famous a 
man was bound to have one at 



least. The lucky ones might even, 
by invitation, pass the privateer 
that guarded it and lavish on their 
host praise for the splendor of his 
home, which he could not see but 
always modestly said was worth 
maintaining for the pleasure it gave 
to others. 

Equally, having arrived whether 
by skelter, on foot or by camelback, 
anybody might guess at a second 
skelter. The estate was on rocky, 
ill-favored ground, long unclaimed, 
but a skelter could and did bring in 
sweet water, delicate foods, relics 
salvaged from elsewhere on the 
planet. 

But the third . Only two out 
of Mustapha’s many servants were 
even aware that it was located 
behind that locked door on the 
last-but-one landing of a twisted 
staircase made of drab, worn tiles. 

T here was no light in the room. 

A current of warm air flowed 
from a high-set ventilator. Musta- 
pha Sharif emerged from the skel- 
ter, swiftly and deftly exchanged 
his climatized suit — necessary for 
the visit to Sweden — for his usual 
burnoose and sandals. After listen- 
ing carefully for the sound of foot- 
steps he unlocked the door, stepped 
out, relocked the room. The heat of 
Africa brushed him like fine wires, 
making, his chill skin tingle. 

On the point of starting down the 
staircase he changed his mind and, 
instead, took the last short flight up 
to the rooftop. He needed time to 
digest what he had learned. 

A stool had been set out near the 
parapet. He felt for it, positioned it 
where he could lean comfortably

forward and faced the direction of 
ancient Luxor, which — so he had 
been told — was in line of sight from 
this tower. But he had scarcely 
begun to learn to think in pictures 
before he lost his simulated vision. 
Instead he thought in terms of his 
other senses. The hot dry air bore 
him sounds he readily identified, 
aromas that he knew as intimately 
as he knew his own hunger, thirst, 
fatigue. He sorted out the scents — 
dates, camel dung, humanity, 
cookfires, growing crops, spices, 
wet cloth tentered on poles to 
bleach and several other indistin- 
guishable aromas in the air -today. 
The odors of life, not of death. 

There was going to be another 
poem. He could feel the shy 
probing of its first tendrils at the 
back of his mind, those tender early 
shoots that eventually would knot 
and crack flagstones into frag- 
ments. 

He toyed with a phrase or two. 
The images were elusive. It was too 
soon. But the time would come. 

Content to wait, preferring not to 
wonder whether eventually some- 
one might read and understand his 
work rather than simply admire it 
and draw a correct conclusion 
about his inspiration, he turned his 
mind to another matter: Hans 
Dykstra. 

He had made a mistake in choos- 
ing that man to go with him to the 
nine lost homes. There had better 
not be a tenth. 

In the beginning it had seemed 
that Hans would be an ideal com- 
panion. There were others who 
might have been equally eager to 
buy illegal disused codes, but they 



were greedy, as had been his former 
partner — whom he had been com- 
pelled to lose, regretfully but with 
small compunction, when the man 
had started to pilfer rare and valu- 
able items in such quantities that 
the authorities had grown suspi- 
cious and had clamped down. He 
was buried now and conferring 
what had been the life of his body 
to a field of corn. 

To come upon somebody who 
wanted to leave, as a personal be- 
quest to the whole of mankind, a 
series of documented samples of 
the past, one typical family home 
from each major culture of the pre- 
skelter period — but was content to 
store up his reports until he was 
safely dead — yes, that had seemed 
like a tremendous stroke of luck. 

But Mustapha was wise to the 
ways in which a man could change. 
He knew beyond any possible 
doubt, that the idea of being 
famous in his lifetime had begun to 
erode Hans’s original determina- 
tion as surely as a river erodes the 
lip of a waterfall. 

Sooner or later he would make a 
mistake. Sooner or later he would 
be tempted beyond endurance. He 
would carry home with him some 
precious object — more likely to be a 
tool, perhaps a camera, than a 
mere ornament — and it would be 
recognized by someone aware that 
Hans Dykstra was not entitled to 
possess it. A great deal was legiti- 
mately left from the heyday of man- 
kind’s inventiveness, but not so 
much that it was impossible to 
figure out illegal possessions. 

And when Hans Dykstra’s day of 
temptation came there would be 



18 



GALAXY 




trouble. Dreadful trouble. There- 
fore the day had better not arrive at 

all. 

M ore content after having 
reached that decision, Mus- 
tapha relaxed into pure enjoyment 
of the sounds and scents that the 
breeze bore to him. He was glad he 
had chosen to settle in Middle 
Egypt. It was a place of strong and 
vivid stimuli. Its winds were alive 
with grit from the deserts. Its sun- 
shine was harsh and its night air 
cold. Its water was flavored with 
the essence of inner Africa. And 
many, many of its rocks were 
chased with inscriptions left by 
long-dead hands. 

It was about time he went back 
to the Luxor ruins and refreshed his 
fingertip acquaintance with the 
statues and the stelae. 

Establishing himself here had 
not been easy. There was much 
history in the area, both ancient 
and modern, with a great gap in 
between the two. First, a com- 
munity had flourished and faded in 
Pharaonic times. Next nothing 
much had happened — the life of 
the small village had repeated and 
repeated itself across the land. And 
then men built the Aswan High 
Dam — not the first, which did little 
damage, but the second and newer 
dam — and stole the annual floods 
from the peasants lower down and 
rendered millions of hectares down- 
river infertile, sterile, useless. En- 
tire starving villages of people had 
trudged south to seek a new 
home — and an exhausted few had 
given up the journey here, where it 
was possible to raise subsistence 



crops and pasture a herd of goats. 

Later, when Cairo and Alexan- 
dria were bombed, the Aswan High 
Dam was destroyed. Another horde 
of refugees, this time much larger, 
straggled along the banks of Father 
Nile and found that this was as far 
as they needed to travel in search of 
regular floods and revitalizing de- 
posits of silt. In a year a new town 
grew here — too big for a village, 
built of too many shabby hovels to 
be called a city. 

At first the locals were jealous of 
their well-watered land and de- 
clined to offer welcome to strangers. 
But the natives were slowly growing 
more tolerant. Indeed, they were 
becoming proud that their neighbor 
in the handsome mansion, though 
not Egyptian by birth, was admired 
the world around, was generous to 
the poor, gave work to the deserv- 
ing and altogether behaved in a 
manner befitting those enjoying 
Allah’s favor — bar one thing. He 
had truck with that instrument of 
Shaitan, the skelter. Even the most 
ignorant mud-grubbing fellahin 
were aware that the impiety of this 
invention had caused divine wrath 
to descend upon the world. 

Even these reservations were 
being tempered by time. And by 
Mustapha Sharif s judicious dona- 
tions of good seed, new strong baby 
camels, donkeys and useful tools. 
All these could be cleansed of the 
smirch the skelter had left on them 
and put to honest use. Slowly he 
was winning over his people. Now 
many hundreds of the younger 
people came and sat in his courts 
when he held open house on a feast 
day and invited the local imams to

preside at a night-long recitation of 
the Blessed Koran. 

A footstep on the stairs. Think- 
ing he had mused so long it 
was time for the muezzin to utter a 
prayer call, he roused and turned. 

But those Soft slippers did not 
belong to the muezzin. Here came 
Ali, his most trusted body-servant. 
"What is it?” he demanded. 

He heard shushing sounds — Ali 
was bowing. 

“It is to be hoped that the work 
will not suffer,” he said in a tone of 
regret. "One attends below, how- 
ever, who wishes with urgency to 
speak with you. His name is Dr. 
Frederick Satamori.” 

Mustapha’s heart lurched half- 
way to his soles. The Deputy 
Director of the Skelter Authority. 
What could have brought him here 
in person? 

Myriad fearful images chased 
one another across his mind — 
memories of all the houses he had 
visited illegally, of all the codes he 
had sold first to his former partner, 
then to Hans Dykstra, who was so 
unconvincing in his role as a col- 
lector of finely calligraphed books 
of Arabic poetry . 

He gathered himself with an ef- 
fort. ‘‘Request Dr. Satamori to 
make himself comfortable in the 
Room of the Leopards,” he direct- 
ed. “Bring him refreshments. In- 
form him that I shall join him in a 
few minutes.” 

“The effendi’s will is done,” Ali 
said, backing away, his sandals 
scraping the sand-dusted floor. 

But it was more than a few 
minutes before Mustapha regained 



his normal composure and was able 
to find his way down the twisted 
staircase.

H ans wondered absently — what 
had the woman of that house 
been like? Tall, from her skeleton 
propped up in bed — devoid of a 
visible wound like her husband’s 
but maybe she had been shot or 
stabbed in the throat or belly — but 
beautiful? Blonde? Blue-eyed? 

No doubt there would be pictures 
of her in an album or a drawer, and 
of her husband and child, even 
though none had been on display. 

She must at all events have been 
better than that lazy greedy incom- 
petent smug ungrateful . 

Resentful thoughts in his resent- 
ful brain, he stepped out of the 
skelter into his own hallway — and 
saw Dany rising from a chair to 
confront him. 

He stopped, petrified. She had 
no business to be at home. She had 
told him she was off to a treasure 
hunt, a favorite pastime in the 



20 



GALAXY 




circles she frequented. He had re- 
lied on her solving the imbecilic 
clues, finding her way to the right 
place, staying at least several hours 
in the company of her friends. 

Hers, Not his. 

But here she was — and here he 
was, with the mask he had put on 
after her departure still around his 
neck, frost on the outlet vent of his 
suit, a score of fatal clues in plain 
sight for anyone to weave a noose 
for him. 

Or worse — a bracelet, symbol of 
living death. 

“Hans, where the hell have you 
been? 1 want your help.” 

Words flared instantly into his 
consciousness: Liar. When you 
accept help the millennium will 
have arrived. I've told you over and 
over that you need it and Karl 
Bonetti would supply it and — the 
hell with you. May your next bug be 
fatal . 

But he couldn’t say them. He was 
hung up by his conscience, a 
contra-survival thing inasmuch as 
it made him vulnerable, but one 
enjoined on him by the faith he had 
adopted, the Way of Life. Besides, 
to have an actual wife, legally 
bound — no matter that she was ag- 
ing, fat, plain, querulous and sel- 
fish — was a great status symbol. 
Young subordinates came to him 
during brief breaks from the job in 
Caracas or Calcutta or Cardiff to 
pose him problems about their sex 
lives and ask his experienced 
opinion. Thanks to a contagious 
puerperal fever, CPF, men out- 
numbered women five to three and 
the disease was still rife. Until suf- 
ficient vaccine to treat half a billion 



people all at once could be de- 
ployed the pattern would remain 
constant — any female who was even 
passably attractive could and gene- 
rally would ignore marriage. She 
would stay free to trade in one man 
for another for any advantage she 
might gain. 

Hans fought for a grip on his 
thoughts. Dany was stupid and 
might not put two and two together 
from his outfit — she had often seen 
him come home similarly clad from 
a day's work. He said peaceably, 
invoking the authorized hobby he 
had adopted as a cover for his real 
pastime, “I’ve been out shooting 
photographs as usual. What’s the 
trouble and what can I do?” 

And looked at her for once, 
instead of merely registering her 
presence. 

T he sight was remarkable. She 
had on a pathetically glamor- 
ous new outfit, obviously expensive,

Shapex bolero, wrinkled skin be- 
tween, a tropical or sub-tropical 
style more extreme than was com- 
mon around the Mediterranean in 
winter. The whole was tipped with 
hood, boots and gauntlets lined 
with fur (genuine, as he well knew 
because his team had found the 
skins during a survey he had lately 
mounted in Saskatchewan) and 
framed with an all-zones climatized

she were too desperate for time to 
take it off even in the temperate air 
of Malta. Not only her face, but her 
legs, bare midriff and presumably 
arms had been plastered with inex-

pert makeup — she jangled with 
jewelry and stank of far too much 
perfume. But as long as she was 
content with her appearance . 

“I’ve been invited to a party at 
Chaim Aleuker’s,” she almost 
screamed, holding up a slip of 
card. "But I 'can’t figure out the 
clue in the invitation — ” 

Hans stared in disbelief. Invited 
to a party by Chaim Aleuker? 
This — this wreck? Aleuker was 
probably the richest man alive, 
thanks to having invented the priv- 
ateer, the code-shifting device that 
had changed the skelter from a wild 
beast to a domesticated draft 
animal, as it were. Millions of 
people who had never met him re- 
acted to his name as to an electric 
shock — and Hans did so now. 

For an instant he wondered 
whether he could be wrong about 
Dany — making ill-founded judg- 
ments. After six years of marriage 
he was sharing little of his daily life 
with her. Perhaps she did possess 
some outstanding quality. Perhaps 
the fact of her having stayed 
married to him had singled her out 
or some other aspect of her person- 
ality had — 

But she was already disillusion- 
ing him. 

“Don’t look at me like that,” she 
snapped. “It’s perfectly true about 
the invitation. Apparently Aleuker 
is bored with the people he knows 
and wants to meet some new ones, 
so he’s sent out cards like this all 
over the world. Molly Chu got one 
as well, but the bitch won’t join 
forces to work out what it means.” 

“You should consult the library 
computer,” Hans suggested, his 



tone still level and polite. 

“Do you think I’m an idiot? 
Would I have asked you if the com- 
puter had been any help, you — you 
pompous clod?” 

Alarm signal. Next she would be 
raking up his past, about which he 
was five years too old not to feel em- 
barrassed even if living with Giu- 
seppe and Hakim had been faute 
de mieux. His quarrels with Dany 
always followed an identical pattern 
because they had not grown up in 
the atmosphere of tolerance dis- 
played by the post-Blowup genera- 
tion. 

It must be great, he often felt, to 
have come to terms with reality, 
instead of laboring under the 
delusive burden of a vanished 
world, leaden with prejudices and 
preconceptions. He did do his 
best — struggled to accept the doc- 
trines of the Way of Life and act on 
them. Perhaps if he had managed 
to find a younger wife? 

No, that was out of the question. 
Possibly he ought to have resigned 
himself to bachelorhood, especially 
since his marriage was compulsorily 
childless. 

Y ounger people had no memory 
of ancient evils like churches 
and nation-states. But they were all 
too keenly aware of their legacy. 

Their frontiers nullified by the 
skelter, under constant attack by 
saboteurs and partisans who could 
be half a world away before their 
time bombs exploded, five of the 
Great Powers had gone into insen- 
sate nuclear spasms, as though they 
had taken strychnine. The sur- 
vivors, or at least some of them, be-

lieved their governments had also 
been responsible for the subsequent 
epidemics. Given that foundation 
to build on, they had abandoned at 
last everything their ancestors had 
taken pride in — patriotism, reli- 
gion, conformist morality, group 
solidarity . Oh, not completely, 
not all at once. But for the third 
and final time the wisdom-chain 
had been shattered — so ran the 
teachings of the Way of Life. 

In the beginning, the argument 
declared, to be older had meant to 
be wiser — to have had more ex- 
perience of how things are, to be 
more in touch with the realities of 
human existence. 

Then had come a war that had 
murdered a whole generation of 
fine young men in mud and blood 
and murmurings of dissent had ac- 
companied them to their unmarked 
graves. 

The saying had been: We have 
fought the War to End War. Many 
had believed and been comforted. 

In one more generation had 
come another war, one that killed 
not only young men but old people 
and little children in their beds, 
that loosed the firepower of the uni- 
verse on the fragile flesh of man. 

By that time young people had 
begun saying in tones of extreme 
puzzlement, Grandfather promised 
peace to father and father swore he 
would preserve it and father is dead 
in an ugly, cruel manner. Can we 
trust nobody at all? 

And then had come the third 
war, the Blowup, and the wisdom- 
chain — already filed twice at its 
crucial link — snapped. 

It was a new world. But a new 



world that must understand the old 
in order to surpass it. Hans Dykstra 
was convinced of that. 

R ight now there was no time for 
, reflection, though. He needed 
some means to placate his wife. 
Being too slow, he failed. This was 
unusual. Ordinarily he was quick 
to react and forestall her — he had 
to be, because the risk of her leav- 
ing him was so high. No matter that 
she was close to fifty — no matter 
that under the thick powder dark 
bags marred her eyes and her 
cheeks were crested with blue-red 
broken veins — no matter that her 
bust, her belly and her bottom 
sagged — -she was a wife. And for a 
young man nowadays no achieve- 
ment surpassed stealing away a 
wife. Legal bonds notwithstanding, 
Hans could lose her. 

Yet this time he was laggard. 
Dany made it as far as sobs and 
wails. 

She was eighteen years older 
than he. Like many of her genera- 
tion — of both sexes — she was sub- 
ject to crying fits born of sheer de- 
spair at the disappearance of the 
world she had been taught to 
believe in as a child. Perhaps 
earlier than most she had learned 
to exploit tears as a weapon against 
anybody who worried about her, 
who cared whether or not she killed 
herself in accordance with her 
frequent threats. It was there, Hans 
suspected, that one should seek the 
reason for her not accepting the in- 
vitation she had been granted by 
Karl Bonetti. 

Karl was a psychiatrist who prac- 
ticed on the neighboring island of 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



23 




Gozo. Islands were popular among 
those who were lucky enough to en- 
joy access to the skelter system — 
they were instant geographical 
symbols of freedom from the limits 
of separative space. This condition 
of depressive nostalgia being so 
common, Karl had literally hun- 
dreds of patients on supportive 
therapy because he couldn’t cope 
individually with them. But Hans 
had located a drug Karl desperately 
wanted dug out of the scrap-pile of 
Europe and, out of gratitude, he 
had offered to add Dany to his list. 

One of these days Hans was go- 
ing to insist. But not today. Right 
now he wanted her safely out of the 
way so that he could get to his dark- 
room and see how the pictures of 
the Swedish house had come out. 

4 4T ET me look,” he finally cajoled 
■ i and she switched off the 
sobs. She gave him the card, wear- 
ing, he thought, the hopeful ex- 
pression of a slum child promised a 
day in the country. He selected the 
image with conscious pride from 
the stock of data about the near 
past he carried in his head. In the 
old days it had been said that the 
period of history about which 
people knew least was the one di- 
rectly before they were born — too 
recent to be taught from a book, 
too vivid still for the elders to offer 
an objective appraisal. He had 
resolved not to let the saying be true 
in his own case. 

The card bore a short enigmatic 
verse, akin to a crossword puzzle 
clue. That much he had expected. 
He had not foreseen that — if this 
did indeed emanate from Chaim 



Aleuker — it would be so childishly 
simple. 

He read aloud, without stressing 
the rhythm, ‘“I’ll give to you some 
exercise and syllogisms from the 
wise. Madam will you talk, madam 
will you walk and talk with me?”’ 

“It’s — it's sort of like poetry, I 
think,” Dany ventured. “The li- 
brary computer says it goes to an 
old English tune called The Keys of 
Canterbury. " 

"So I suppose Canterbury was 
the first place you made for?” he 
countered — more scathingly than 
he had intended. The last thing he 
wanted was for her to lose her tem- 
per so completely she would decide 
to stay home for the pleasure of 
spoiling his own leisure time. 

She colored, although one would 
have imagined her too old to blush, 
and miraculously replied in a 
mutter instead of a scream. 

“I couldn’t — not the original 
Canterbury anyway. They dropped 
so many bombs on eastern Eng- 
land. But there’s another Canter- 
bury in New Zealand, so I went 
there, but there wasn’t anyone to 
give me the second card and — ” 

“Oh, honestly!” He handed back 
the card. “What about Athens — 
the Lyceum? Aristotle founded a 
school of philosophy there. They 
called it the Peripatetic School — 
the walking-around school — be- 
cause of his habit of strolling along 
while he was lecturing.” 

“Are you sure?” she asked 
doubtfully. 

“Ah — no. I’m not even sure the 
Lyceum still exists even as a ruin. 
But I think it may — Athens was 
among the few capital cities that 



24 



GALAXY 




didn’t get blasted, wasn’t it? Look, 
you check out the idea. If it doesn’t 
fit come back and see if I’ve 
thought of an alternative.” 

He had been ready to cap his 
contribution to her day’s amuse- 
ment with a kiss, but his tentative 
gesture went to waste. She snatched 
back the card and headed for the 
skelter at a run, tossing over her 
shoulder a word of thanks that was 
literally cut in half as the transmis- 
sion effect displaced her. 

Typical. 

But at least she had left him in 
peace. For that small mercy he 
made perfunctory obeisance to the 
nearest life symbol — here in the 
hallway they kept a tortoise, be- 
cause Dany refused to be content 
with a mere plant in sight of the 
spot where invited guests gained 
their first impression of the Dykstra 
residence — before shutting his 
darkroom door.

— Mustapha Sharif 



D r. Frederick satamori hailed, 
of course, not from mainland 
Japan but from Okinawa (again, 
the association with the concept 
“island”). 

And he met Mustapha in the 
Room of the Leopards — leopards 
the owner of the house had never 
seen, could scarcely imagine, for 
they existed in paint on the walls 
and had been varnished over so 
that not even the minuscule dis- 
continuity between one color and 
another revealed the fine detail of 
the design to Mustapha’s probing 
fingers. 

Yet imagination populated the 
room with watchful threat — the 
alert tension belonging to beasts 
that must scent, spot, run down 
and overcome their prey. Sighted or 
blind, Mustapha who had early 
grown acquainted with the reality 
of such abstracts as “hunger” well 
understood the concepts “quest” 
and "quarry". To come in here was 
to taste blood in anticipation. 

Yet he had no grudge against 
Satamori. He might have picked 
the Room of Elephants, or of 
Fishes, or of Flowers . 

Never mind — his choice of meet- 
ing place had been dictated by in- 
stinct. And now they were both 
here and both tea and coffee had 
been made available — the scents 
mingled — and Satamori had come 
freshly from a place that flavored 
his presence with jasmine, lavender 
and the smoke of some resinous 
tree being burned on an open fire. 

He rose and clasped his host’s 
proffered hand and spoke formal 
greetings that conveyed less infor- 
mation than the sweat of his palm.

This man, Mustapha thought, is 
frightened. So am I. But he, having 
eyes, is less likely to be aware o f my 
fear. Good. 

Relaxing, he sat down and in- 
quired, “Fred, why bother to come 
calling in person when there was a 
risk of my discourteously making 
you wait? You should have 
phoned.” 

“There are times,” Satamori 
said dryly, “when waiting for a call 
to be put through makes one more 
impatient than waiting to be let 
past a privateer. Today is — ” 

“My servants made you wait in 
the skelter?” Mustapha interrupted 
in horror. 

“No, no — they were the soul of 
courtesy. Indeed it was not my idea 
to disturb you, but Ali’s. I was 
merely happy to break my journey.” 

“Journey?” 

“Yes. 1 have to go around the 
world today, to its other side. 
Switching from dawn to evening is 
no longer easy for me. I’m old.” 

“That isn’t true,” Mustapha 
said. 

“You are kind, but I’m afraid it 
is. I’m still under sixty, but the 
strain is beginning to make me 
understand what old age is.” 
Satamori sighed loudly and took a 
sip of his coffee. He added after a 
pause. “Too many of us are old.” 

Mustapha waited. 

“Anyway,” the visitor resumed, 
“I felt I could take the risk of inter- 
rupting your contemplation and 
would have been quite content to 
wait for an hour or two without dis- 
turbing you, thinking we might go 
on together to Chaim’s party. But 
Ali felt he should announce me.” 



“What party?” 

Satamori almost dropped his 
cup. “But — but surely of all people 
you must have been — ” 

His voice trailed away. 

“I begin to comprehend," Mus- 
tapha said. “Are you referring by 
any chance to a treasure hunt?” 
“What else?” 

“I see,” Mustapha murmured 
and relished the conscious irony of 
the phrase. “You too believe that 
by sprinkling the planet with clues 
that may come to the attention of 
random people — and require a 
moderately advanced IQ to un- 
ravel — we can find the next genera- 
tion of managers and administra- 
tors for Earth.” 

“I can’t conceive of a better 
way,” Satamori granted. “I should 
not have mentioned the matter, 
though. I’m sorry. I simply was not 
aware that you were opposed to it.” 
Mustapha leaned back, stretch- 
ing cramped limbs. He said, “It is 
not I who am opposed. The oppo- 
sition comes from something deep- 
er — the force that evolved us.” 
Brief blank silence. Satamori 
said eventually, “You are adherent 
to the Way of Life? One had as- 
sumed that you must be — ” 

“Moslem because I chose to live 
in Egypt?” Mustapha cut in. “Not 
at all — I am a skeptic. But I picked 
on Egypt because it was here that 
the cycle of the seasons, the rise 
and fall of the Nile, taught men to 
create absolutes — strict measures 
of distance, area and elapsed time. 
I often think of death. When I do I 
feel certain I would rather die in the 
faith of the modern upstarts than in 
the faith of my ancestors. Has that

notion never crossed your mind? 
Forgive me — this is not something 
one asks a friend. Being blind oc- 
casionally makes me tactless.” 
“You — ” One could hear Sata- 
mori having to moisten his lips. 
‘‘You hold Moslem ceremonies 
here at your home.” 

“Indeed, indeed. But as to the 
Koran — well, without wishing to 
appear arrogant, I could have com- 
piled a more convincing book of di- 
vine revelation myself. The same 
goes for the Christian Bible and the 
Little Red Book as well.” Musta- 
pha laughed to diminish the weight 
of his words. 

“And you could also, no doubt, 
have edited the doctrines of the 
Way of Life?” Satamori snapped. 
“My dear friend, I did.” 



T he silence was strangled. At 
long last Satamori forced out: 
“If this is another of your subtle 
jokes you must pardon a foreigner 
for not — ” 

“Ah, I am doing what I always 
do without being able to help my- 
self]” Mustapha cried. “When I’m 
interrupted during the composition 
of a poem — no, don't blame your- 
self, I was making very poor head- 
way and the result will be all the 
better for being punctuated by a 
night’s sleep — but when I am in- 
terrupted I tend to grow snappish. 
I’ve given offense without intention. 
Let me hear that I've apologized to 
your satisfaction!” 

“No offense was taken,” Sata- 
mori muttered. 

“Ah, I’m glad. But I did provoke 
you into suspecting me of a some- 



what silly joke, did I not? I should 
erase that notion, too. I meant 
what I said literally. I did edit many 
of the sayings of Prince Knud — 
from an English version admitted- 
ly, not the original Swedish — and if 
there is any form, shape, structure 
to the texts — well, I imposed it.” 

Satamori drew a hissing breath 
and with the sound the room seem- 
ed to fill with the chill of the north- 
ern winter (the Erikssons’ home 
locked in Arctic night) and the 
threat of Ragnarok that rode the 
flood-tide of the skelter. Some time 
passed. 

Eventually Mustapha said, his 
tone thoughtful, “One is inclined to 
wonder how the world views what 
one does. It’s rare for an artist to be 
pleased to discover that what he is 
proud of is anonymous and un- 
credited, but in this instance that 
paradox is the truth. It was painful 
for me to discover that all the tenets 
I had been brought up to were 
false. But I am not alone in that. 
What perhaps I may claim to be 
alone in is that I did something 
about it.” 

“I’m glad that you said nothing 
about this before,” Satamori snap- 
ped. “I might not have — ” 

He sounded as though he were 
threatening to rise. Mustapha 
reached out a hand to check him. 

“My friend. I did not do what I 
did to insult you and your creed — 
only to give what light I could to the 
world after the light was stolen 
from my eyes." A wave at his bright 
but sightless gaze, turned by sound 
to confront and transfix the other 
man. 

“I — Yes, granted.” Satamori re-

27 




sumed his chair. “Even so I — ” 
“You still believe that doing 
honor to the ancestors is among a 
man’s primary obligations. I will 
not contradict. I would prefer to — 
supplement.” Mustapha’s tone was 
persuasive without being downright 
wheedling, a narrow path to walk 
with words. “You must at least 
concede it’s better to honor the 
ancestors for what they did right 
than for the mistakes which, had 
they the chance, they would re- 
pent?” 

Satamori hesitated. “I believe I 
read a poem of yours on that sub- 
ject,” he muttered. “In translation, 
I’m afraid.” 

M ustapha wanted to tremble — 
this was so close to what he 
had been worrying about within the 
past hour, the notion that someone 
would ultimately look at his work 
and see through it — but he over- 
came the impulse. Not a quaver 
showed in his voice as he answered. 
“I am always glad when somebody 
reads and recalls my poetry, in 
whatever version. But do you not 
concede I have a valid point?” 

“I suppose I have to.” Satamori 
heaved a deep sigh. “I do believe it 
was the — the continuity of our be- 
liefs that carried us through the ter- 
rible period after the Blowup. And 
I do believe that if we hadn’t had 
our respective faiths to use for 
crutches we might never have risen 
again — even as far as we have risen 
today.” 

“On the other hand,” Mustapha 
said, “it was because we held to the 
beliefs that we did that we reached 
the point of striking out insanely in 



all directions with some of our most 
terrible weapons. The Blowup is 
now two generations in the past, 
but it has left so deep a scar on the 
collective psyche of mankind that 
we will go to any lengths to avoid a 
repetition. For an intelligent young 
person today it is more significant 
that we suffered a population crash 
corresponding with- incredible pre- 
cision to the example set by rabbits 
infected with myxomatosis — and 
that we have thus been shown 
subject to natural laws — than that 
idealistic dreamers in ancient times 
conceived of man as being superior 
to his animal cousins. Moreover, so 
many of us died. As we reopen the 
contaminated areas of the planet 
we find we are walking through a 
giant graveyard. It is almost liter- 
ally impossible to ignore the pres- 
ence of our forebears’ dead 
bodies.” 

“You always had a sweet tongue, 
Mustapha,” Satamori said. “Today 
you are excelling yourself — and 
you’ve touched me on a very raw 
spot, too. Half of me knows in my 
head that one must fight the super- 
stitious fear of death or we shall 
forever be shut off from vast tracts 
of what are now again becoming 
habitable lands — and we need that 
space precisely because we did 
suffer a typical population crash. 
The other half of me stands in irra- 
tional awe of our ancestors, as 
though they had indeed become 
ghosts — or spirits, or whatever you 
call them — and ought not to be dis- 
turbed.” 

He set aside his coffee cup, now 
empty, and declined Ali’s solicitous 
offer of a refill.

“On the other hand, by inventing 
the privateer Chaim did free us 
from that terrifying abolition of 
privacy which was so alarming to us 
that we stopped at nothing to — But 
1 said that to you before and didn’t 
convince you.” 

“Nothing, I’m afraid, will con- 
vince me that applying the same 
principles that led to our near-sui- 
cide can rescue us from our 
remaining troubles,” Mustapha 
said in a tone of regret. “1 wish 1 
could believe the opposite. To be 
able to do so would make life 
simpler, wouldn’t it? But in fact 
I’m certain that only a complete re- 
assessment of our place on the 
planet, our relationship to other life 
forms, in sum, an abdication of our 
arrogance, will enable us to escape 
another and another and maybe 
another absolutely final disaster 
similar to the Blowup. Skeptic 
though I am, I regard the teachings 
of the Way of Life as likely to 
encourage a proper humility in us, 
the sort of attitude that alone can 
permit us to survive.” 

He gathered the skirts of his 
gown and rose. 

“So 1 shall not attend Chaim's 
treasure hunt — even by direct invi- 
tation. I have no wish to see 
another generation of managers, 
bureaucrats and administrators 
wrap this species of ours in their 
steel web of inflexible rules and 
regulations. I don’t want to be 
party to the perpetuation of a 
system that condemned two-thirds 
of humanity to death. Better to 
expire of plague, starvation or cold 
than to be killed by the voluntary 
act of another man.” 



“In so many ways 1 agree and in 
so many I don’t.” Satamori also 
rose, shaking his head — Mustapha 
could hear the faint brushing of his 
nape hairs against the stiff collar of 
his formal coat. 

“What it comes down to,” Mus- 
tapha said, “is that mankind from 
now on must be governed by artists, 
not by politicians. There is no other 
conceivable manner in which a 
survival-prone society can be or- 
ganized. We must evolve an aesthe- 
tic of government free from ideolo- 
gical trammels. We must commit 
our fate into the hands of those who 
derive artistic satisfaction from see- 
ing a well-ordered community, who 
will crack their skulls into the small 
hours of the morning over a flaw in 
their schemes — as I may worry 
myself sleepless over a line in a 
poem until it suddenly turns head 
over heels and comes out right.” 

“You think those in power don’t 
already worry like that?” Satamori 
countered wryly. “Oh, we do — we 
do! But, since the subject of your 
work has arisen by implication — 
and I have an hour to waste before 
continuing to Chaim’s — I should 
much enjoy another tour of your 
ateliers — ” 

“It will be my pleasure,” Musta- 
pha said, bowing. 

So they passed the next hour in 
walking around that part of Mus- 
tapha's home where his corps of as- 
sistants were at work. He had over 
a hundred now. They were orphans 
of both sexes whom he had re- 
cruited as little children — their 
parents being dead of violence or 
disease — and taught a trade that 
would furnish them employment

for a lifetime. Some worked at 
copying out not only his poems but 
far more ancient texts, chiefly in 
Arabic. Some, though, were in 
European languages. For these 
they used a classic chancellery hand 
and illuminated the result with ex- 
quisite drawings based on models 
provided by the chief scribe, Muley 
Hassan. Others were busy in the 
papermill, converting old rags, 
straw, corn husks and a score of 
miscellaneous vegetable substances 
into fresh new deckle-edged sheets. 
Others again worked in the bind- 
ery, where the air was pleasantly 
scented with glue and size, putting 
the final touches to the volumes 
that commanded collectors’ prices 
the world around, irrespective of 
whether the buyer could read the 
contents or not. 

Satamori fell instantly in love 
with a collection of old folk tales 
and put down a deposit of five 
thousand to secure possession of it 
when it was finished and properly 
bound.

— Mustapha Sharif 

H ans was shaking as he entered 
his darkroom. It was always 
like this when he returned from one 
of his secret expeditions. He was on 
edge because he could never tell in 
advance whether he would have 
anything to show for the risk he had 
run. 

It was getting harder and harder 
to purchase reliable film. The 
Economics Authority, of course, 
knew to the last centimeter how 
much was currently being manu- 
factured, so for a project of this 
kind he had to depend on recuper- 
ated stock, which all too often 
proved to have been fagged by radi- 
ation. 

Neo- Polaroid was easier to come 
by — the available computing ca- 
pacity was simply not up to deter- 
mining whether or not a given 
buyer was telling the truth when he 
claimed he’d wasted half his last 
batch because he was drunk and 
had thrown the bad pictures in the 
garbage a month ago. But Hans 
would not have dared switch to it, 
because it had to be developed as 
soon as it was exposed. Carrying 
visual evidence of his surreptitious 
journeys would have been suicidal. 
A film could be blurred by spring- 
ing the cap of its cassette — he had 
modified several specially, to make 
doing so easier in an emergency — 
and he always took along decoy 
film, too, exposed at places he was 
officially entitled to visit. 

Dany, of course, was not party to 
his secret. She would have betrayed

him in a fit of depression. 

Moving with the ease of long 
practice in total darkness (and 
thinking about blindness as he 
worked), Hans decided that for 
once he would process his impor- 
tant film first, not the decoy he had 
shot on his way to rendezvous with 
Mustapha. That could serve again. 
In any case he was suspicious of its 
quality. He prepared his developing 
bath, opened the cassette with a 
tingle of excitement — 

And was suddenly dazzled by 
brilliant light as the door was flung 
wide. 

He stood rigid as a rock, looking 
at the ruined film in his hand. 

A shrill voice gnawed at his mind 
like a worm attacking the core of an 
apple. 

“Hans, you were right about 
Athens. There’s a public skelter 
terminal called Lyceum, only they 
spell it a funny way. So I went 
there. But then somebody changed 
my card for another one and I can’t 
figure this out either — Oh. Is 
something wrong?” 

Gone: cobwebs. Gone: dust like 
snow unmarred by footprints. 
Gone: the irrecoverable “after” to 
pair with the reconstructed "be- 
fore." 

In the next five seconds he came 
close to murdering his wife. But he 
changed his mind. He thought of 
something sweeter and more fitting. 
He tossed aside the film and 
turned, cordial of expression and 
tone. 

“Well, what does the second 
card say?” 

She proffered it uncertainly. Like 
the first, it bore a clue in rhyme. 



The answer, unless he was over- 
looking something ridiculously 
subtle, must be Oaxaca. 

“Can you work it out?” Dany 
pressed. “I do so much want to get 
to Aleuker’s party!” 

“Yes, I'm sure you do,” he 
agreed, moving forward as though 
to obtain a better light on the card. 
And continued, having drawn a 
deep breath: “Only — what makes 
you think Aleuker will want you as 
a guest? He’s inviting people intelli- 
gent enough to solve these puzzles 
for themselves. Knowledgeable 
people, well-informed, who will be 
interesting for him to be acquainted 
with. You, on the other hand, are 
stupid, silly, greedy, selfish, boring 
and totally inconsiderate of other 
people. When you burst in on me 
just now you wrecked something I 
set a lot of store by. It’s gone past 
recall because you were too im- 
patient to knock.” 

"But I asked if anything was 
wrong — ” In a wail. He ignored the 
interruption. 

"So I think it would be a good 
idea if I kept out of your way for a 
while, because if I see you again 
today I shall certainly beat you to a 
whimpering pulp. I’ll go to Aleu- 
ker’s party. When I get back I may 
have sweated out my anger.” 

“No! No, you wouldn’t steal my 
chance — ” Clawing at him with in- 
effective pudgy hands. He slapped 
her accurately on the left cheek 
and, as she shrank back, convinced 
by pain that he meant what he said, 
made for the skelter. 

An echo of her curses seemed to 
follow him, though he knew that 
was impossible.

I t was not a short trip, nor a 
quick one, but he relished the 
going. At Oaxaca Concourse, over- 
looking the abandoned airport, it 
was raining and cracks in the con- 
crete roof of the skelter hall allowed 
warm dirty water to drip down into 
plastic buckets. 

A shabby young man exchanged 
the card Hans was carrying for still 
another, under the watchful eyes of 
the travel-hungry who pretended 
not to be. These were a vast group, 
hundreds strong, of so-called 
stucks, so terrified of skelter travel 
they could not summon up the 
courage to pass the nonexistent bar- 
rier dividing them from the cluster- 
ed transit booths. It was not in- 
ability to pay that held them 
back — skelter travel cost nothing. 
There was no way of pricing infinite 
speed over nil net expenditure of 
power. 

The shabby young man was con- 
temptuous of the stucks and let it 
show, although he himself could no 
more use the skelters than could 
they. His reason, however, was tan- 
gible. He was a bracee — the tell- 
tale glint of bright metal shone 
under the cuff of one loose sleeve. 
He was far from home, moreover— 
he had the flat face of a North 
Chinese. 

He did not even seem to know 
Hans had addressed him in Eng- 
lish, and Hans was reminded of 
Mustapha’s proteges. 

For obvious reasons he had sel- 
dom visited his co-conspirator’s 
home, but he vividly recalled that 
first trip he had made in order to 
establish his credentials as a col- 
lector of books likely to increase in 



value. He had been shown around. 

Granted that the young people 
Mustapha took in and taught 
might otherwise have died in the 
gutter, granted that it must cost a 
vast amount every year to support 
them and purchase necessary sup- 
plies for the scriptorium and the 
bindery and the rest of the opera- 
tion — Hans nonetheless had his 
own opinions about a setup that 
furnished so many nubile bed-com- 
panions. He was aware that Mus- 
tapha displayed the traditional 
Arabic indifference to their sex. 
Still, the link between those young- 
sters at Luxor and this youth at 
Oaxaca, was tenuous — it summed 
simply to the suspicion that the per- 
son handing out Aleuker’s cards 
might well be Mustapha’s type. 

Why had the notion occurred to 
him at all? 

The reason was instantly ob- 
vious. He had been wondering al- 
most unconsciously what he would 
do if being deprived of her chance 
to attend Aleuker’s party drove 
Dany to the pitch of leaving him. 

He almost changed his mind and 
went home immediately. He was 
certain he would never again find 
himself a wife — there was far too 
much competition. But he steeled 
his resolution. It wasn’t worth be- 
ing married if he had to put up with 
the sort of thing Dany had just 
done to him. Better to live alone, 
rent a woman when he wanted to, 
maybe find a tolerable male com- 
panion — such as this braced youth, 
perhaps — to keep house — there was 
no shame attached to that. 

In any case, he was being in- 
terrupted.

GALAXY 




S ome of the eyes fixed on him as 
he studied his new card did not 
belong to stucks. A loose group of 
about a dozen travelers, mostly 
youthful, had spotted him as he 
addressed the shabby man. No 
doubt they, too, were following 
Aleuker’s trail. How many invita- 
tions could the man have issued? If 
the net had been cast wide enough 
to entangle Dany the number logi- 
cally ran to thousands. 

Therefore, too, there must be 
many eager-beavers who were pur- 
suing imagined shortcuts, punch- 
ing LNA codes into sub-legal com- 
puters for Aleuker’s last notified 
address — or were risking a bracelet 
by offering bribes to skelter system 
officials who might have heard a 
rumor about the actual location of 
the party. 

Among the young people here 
present was an attractive girl in her 
early twenties, product of the fan- 
tastic mixing of the gene pool the 
skelter had brought about. Her 
lace alone hinted at ancestors from 
at least three continents. She 
whispered something to a male 
companion of her own age and ad- 
vanced boldly toward Hans, swing- 
ing her hips and donning a flashing 
smile. 

Ordinarily, like any other man of 
his generation, Hans would have 
preened a little and relished the 
chance to exchange a mere dozen 
words with her. Right now he has 
immune to feminine wiles. He 
strode directly back to the nearest 
vacant transit booth and punched a 
axle as though he had solved the 
riddle at a glance. 

In fact he had not — he had 



simply made for the Gozo public 
outlet, the code for which he had 
long ago memorized because Karl 
Bonetti recieved his patients in a 
former hotel nearby, now rented 
out as offices. The skelter, inevi- 
tably, had killed the hotel business. 
There was no need for anybody to 
rent, a room overnight, no matter 
how far he might be from home. He 
could work half a world away and 
sleep in his own bed. Karl did pre- 
cisely that. Hans had a vague idea 
the psychiatrist actually lived some- 
where in Greenland, but for good 
and sufficient reasons his home 
code was never divulged. 

At the Gozo terminal Hans sat 
down on a stone bench and with 
some enjoyment — which surprised 
him because he had never before 
considered going to a treasure 
hunt — unraveled the complex dou- 
ble meanings of a mock haiku. 
They led him to Pitcairn Island and 
another young man with more 
cards, who seemed even worse off 
than the one at Oaxaca. This one 
had been braced twice and lacked 
his right hand as witness of the effi- 
ciency of the anti-tamper circuit in 
his first bracelet. Some attempt this 
young man presumably had made 
to remove the metal ring had fired a 
shaped charge, focused inward. 

Very messy. 



at pitcairn Hans saw three re- 
/V cipients of cards hanging 
about. All were too shy to approach 
him. One was a woman in early 
middle age. The two men verged on 
the elderly and wore the air of 
scholars. In any case, Hans had no

Bucharest. There was an excru- 
ciating pun on “lei", obviously de- 
signed to misdirect the less percep- 
tive into making for Honolulu. And 
from Bucharest he stepped into a 
private skelter in New Zealand, 
thinking that if Dany ever learned 
how close she had been to her goal 
when she hit on Canterbury she 
would die of mortification. It would 
be great to tell her when he 
returned home. 

He checked suddenly. He knew 
he had been given — now — a code 
for a private home and it was in the 
right part of the world. He was 
walking on a carpet in a spacious 
reception hall nearly thirty meters 
long. Curtains were drawn across 
its windows. 

He was completely alone and sur- 
rounded by absolute dead silence.

T he declining sun dappled the 
sea with highlights as exagger- 
ated as a Van Gogh painting. 
Reclining on a chaise, Chaim 
Aleuker admired it between taking 
sips of his planter’s punch. He was 



l lie very model of elegant success: 
lean, but with the suggestion of a 
developing paunch — extremely well 
dressed in a loose, casual shirt and 
breeches of real silk. His hair was 
immaculately coiffed and his fin- 
gers were bright with valuable 
antique rings. 

His house — the largest of his 
three homes — overlooked a small 
cove with a northwestern aspect. 
On either side of it green hills ran 
down to stark rocks, but there was 
a smooth sandy beach between. A 
sailboat and a power launch bobbed 
at a tiny jetty. The scene could have 
belonged to the last century. There 
were few such sights to be found 
now anywhere on Earth. 

Around him, sitting or strolling 
or standing in knots of two or three 
and chatting quietly, were the 
guests he had invited to form a nu- 
cleus for his treasure hunt. It was 
unlikely in the extreme that any- 
body new would arrive before eight 
p.m. local — indeed, he had a bet 
with Boris Pech of the Advance- 
ment Authority to that effect — and 
it was not yet seven-thirty. 

So, to keep him company and 
also to assess the quality of any of 
the strangers who found their way 
through his careful maze of clues, 
he had notified some fifteen of his 
compeers to come direct. For a full 
generation after the Blowup per- 
sonal power, influence, initiative 
had meant little. Humanity had 
existed in a totally constrained 
situation where it had been a real 
achievement to keep body and soul 
together — not that that phrase was 
current any longer. But now things 
were back on a more or less steady

keel. A new balance had been 
struck — new class lines had been 
drawn. New meanings had been 
found for rich and poor. 

In a very real sense this handful 
of people — ten men and five 
women — could be said to be in 
charge of Earth. They had rescued 
most from the wreckage and had 
laid down tracks onto which, with 
immense effort, society had been 
hoisted like a derailed locomotive. 
It was grunting forward again now, 
very cautiously in case there should 
prove to be other faults on the line. 
But progress was being made after 
a fashion. 

The solution was not to every- 
body’s taste. The elite (Aleuker 
hated the word) numbered about 
one per cent of the surviving popu- 
lation. This was a simple fact and 
stemmed from the terrible trau- 
matic effects of the Blowup. Re- 
gardless of what reasons were offer- 
ed by people to explain why they 
would have nothing to do with skel- 
ters, the truth could be expressed in 
one word — fear. 

Because they were afraid to share 
what actually was available to all — 
except to those who had been given 
a bracelet for code-breaking or 
using the system for theft or to 
cover up a murder — the non-elite 
sometimes became jealous and 
tried to sabotage the work of the 
new managers. Now and then a 
mob would attack a skelter outlet. 
Now and then one would strike at 
the wealthy, individual by individ- 
ual. 

The elite was far too small. Its 
human resources were being 
stretched so taut one could hear 



them twang. Something had to be 
done to enlarge it. A casually amus- 
ing idea had cropped up recently in 
conversation: hold a treasure hunt, 
the kind of party so much enjoyed 
by small-minded folk on the lowest 
rung of the skelter-using ladder, 
but instead of merely employing it 
as a trivial diversion, turn it into a 
genuine test for those with sharp 
minds and the desire to better 
themselves. 

It was incontestably worth try- 
ing, though Aleuker himself had 
little hope of its paying off. 

44C! TILL expecting to win your 
i3bet with me, Chaim?” a 
voice demanded from his side. 

The speaker was Boris Pech, 
affable, smart in blue suede, 
manager of the Advancement Au- 
thority, which was the most recent 
of the planetary administrative de- 
partments. It had grown from a 
tiny nucleus within the Economics 
Authority, charged with devising 
new means of exploiting what the 
old world had left lying about in 
such colossal quantities — spare 

parts for obsolete machinery, adult 
toys for which there was no longer 
any call, gambling machines and 
the like. Boris Pech had hit on 
countless new ploys and had elected 
himself automatically as head of 
the Advancement Authority when it 
had been created five years ago. 

Its work was little publicized — 
the climate of public opinion was 
still against innovation. But sooner 
or later people would find out that 
it was still possible to make 
progress. 

Chaim chuckled. “Only twenty

minutes are left,” he said. “And 
the clues we planted are pretty dif- 
ficult. You were talking to Fred 
Satamori, weren’t you? He was 
looking gloomy when he arrived — is 
something the matter with him?” 

A waiter passed, carrying a tray 
of drinks and canapes. Boris 
helped himself before replying. 

“Not really — but yes, in a way,” 
he said eventually. 

“1 see. You’ve caught the riddle- 
making habit and now you're 
talking in mysterious gobblede- 
gook.” 

“On the contrary. I’m speaking 
the literal truth. Fred stopped off to 
see Mustapha Sharif on his way 
here, assuming he’d be among the 
guests and thinking they might 
come along together. You know 
he’s been collecting Mustapha’s 
work longer than almost anybody 
else.” 

“Ah.” Chaim tapped the side of 
his glass thoughtfully with one of 
his rings. “Was Mustapha angry at 
not having been invited?” 

“Not at all. Fred said he 
wouldn’t have come even if he had 
been invited. He doesn’t approve of 
our trying to perpetuate the mana- 
gerial system we’ve evolved.” 

“He finally came out and said it 
in so many words? That’s interest- 
ing. And a little bit alarming.” 
Boris blinked. “I’m not with 
you.” 

Chaim stretched, relaxed again. 
“Maybe I exaggerate, but I do be- 
lieve Mustapha is a dangerous 
man. Has it never struck you that 
he’s quite literally the only one of — 
of us, for want of a better term, 
who has succeeded in integrating 



himself into a non-skelter com- 
munity?” 

“That makes him dangerous? I’d 
have said the contrary. It’s high 
time we — ” 

“Naturally, naturally,” Chaim 
interrupted. “But how has he done 
it? By ingratiating himself — by 
what can only be called overt dis- 
honesty. Have you ever attended 
one of those sessions he holds on 
the big Moslem feast days — when 
the imams come and recite the Ko- 
ran all night long? He’s not a be- 
liever. Hell, he edited most of what 
now passes for the authentic teach- 
ing of Prince Knud and he doesn’t 
believe in the Way of Life any more 
than you do. I take it you are still a 
good dialectical materialist?” 

Boris chuckled. “About as much 
as anybody, these days. I don’t 
imagine Papa Lenin — let alone' 
Grandpa Marx — would find much 
to agree with me about if we had a 
chance to chat together. But it did 
happen, didn’t it, that the Soviet 
model came handy when we had to 
try to reconstruct the world’s 
economy?” 

“Oh, we’ve stolen from it whole- 
sale, but only under compulsion: If 
we hadn’t forcibly redistributed the 
available resources far more than 
two-thirds of mankind would have 
died. If we hadn’t taken steps to 
interfere whenever some petty local 
group decided to go seek ven- 
geance — if we hadn’t made it wor th 
the while of those with the neces- 
sary talent to work with us instead 
of against us- — No, without doing as 
we’ve done we’d never have made 
the repairs we have managed, 
makeshift though they are.”

“Mustapha won't concede our 
necessities, will he?” 

“Indeed he won’t. And I’ve never 
been quite sure why. I can’t tell 
whether it’s because he genuinely 
hates, on the gut level, everything 
about the old days and the old 
ways, or whether he’s secretly 
ambitious.” 



B oris’s mouth rounded into an 
O. He said after a pause, “I 
recall a quotation, I think, though I 
can’t remember the exact words. 
An English poet said that people in 
his profession — ” 

“Ah, yes. ‘Unacknowledged law- 
givers’, isn’t that it?” 

“Yes, precisely. Was it Shelley?” 
“I forget. But you’re right to 
mention it in this context. At his 
home Mustapha behaves like a ca- 
liph. By acting out a role the local 
people recognize he has ingratiated 
himself dishonestly.” 

Boris hesitated. He said, “Even 
so, his is a white lie, surely. Life 
would be a lot easier for many of 
us, including yourself, if we did the 
same. It’s no coincidence that so 
many of us now live on small 
islands, where one can get to know 
the local troublemakers personally 
and perhaps calm them down.” 
“Bribe them to calm down?” 
“Occasionally one has to. When 
there’s no alternative. It’s as rigid a 
predicament as the world was in 
thirty years ago.” 

“No, no and again no,” Chaim 
said. “One thing we must not do is 
build the foundations of the future 
on deception. I know there are 
people who hate my guts just on the 



other side of those hills.” He jerked 
a thumb over his shoulders. “Some- 
times I can practically feel their 
breath on the nape of my neck. 
Maoris who ran for shelter in the 
cozy dead end of their old tradi- 
tional ways. White people of British 
stock who were brought up to be- 
lieve their mother country was the 
greatest on Earth and don’t even 
yet accept that it doesn’t exist any 
longer. Nominally I’m a Jew — that 
gives them enough reason to hate 
me even though I bought my land 
legally. Some people have always 
been convinced that any Jew with a 
fortune came by it dishonestly. But 
the one thing we dare not be from 
now on is hypocritical, Boris. We 
mustn’t imitate the lies that 
brought down the old world. We 
mustn’t pretend that riches are a 
burden. We mustn’t deprecate in- 
telligence and we mustn’t preach 
loving brotherhood with a Bible in 
one hand and an H-bomb in the 
other!” 

Boris gave a sober nod. “We’ve 
taken steps in that direction. 
Making the skelter system free and 
open — ” 

“Hah!” Chaim gulped at his 
drink. “What does the village kid 
with ambitions see when he goes to 
a skelter outlet for the first time? 
Stucks, hundreds of them, and 
bracees, blocking his way! Some- 
times they attack people trying to 
get into a transit booth.” 

“Yes, I’ve heard about that. We 
shall simply have to put guards 
on — ” 

“That’s exactly what we must not 
do!” Chaim flared. “Armed patrols 
at skelter terminals? I can’t think

of a worse way of importing the 
foulness of the past into what we 
hope and pray will be a brighter 
future! As a matter of fact, that was 
the chief reason why I agreed to or- 
ganize this party. I’m desperately 
hoping that somebody may turn up 
who thinks in terms of no guards, 
no guns, no locks. Come to that, no 
privateers. If we could only find a 
few people, just a handful, who’ve 
lived all their lives accepting the 
skelter as a fact — who’ve adjusted 
to it instead of regarding it as a 
fearful mechanical monster—” 
Looking lugubrious, he shook his 
head. 

“What you just said reminded 
me,” Boris murmured. “How is 
your private venture in rehabilita- 
tion coming along?” 

“What? Oh, . the wild girl? 
Badly, damn it. In fact. I’m 
minded to quit trying. I never 
realized before, not all the way 
down, how horrible the prejudices 
of the past must have been. Nor 
how crippling they could be to an 
innately intelligent child. I mean, 
she is effectively still a child. I’ve 
tried everything I can think of — 
persuasion, pleading, force of ex- 
ample, formal instruction, bribery. 
Doesn’t work. They used to talk 
about people being afraid of their 
own shadows. What was done to 
her made her afraid of her own sub- 
stance!" 

“But she’ll be around this eve- 
ning?” 

“I guess — maybe. I told her to 
join us. Don’t waste time on her, 
though. It won't be worth it.” 

Suddenly a melodious chime 
rang out and everybody on the 



patio glanced reflexively in the di- 
rection of the sound. Instantly re- 
gaining his usual cordiality, Chaim 
jumped up, glancing at his watch. 

“I just lost my bet! It isn’t nearly 
eight o’clock and somebody has 
found the way here. I wonder who it 
can be.”

at first puzzled, then beginning 
to grow annoyed, Hans ad- 
vanced along the high-ceilinged 
room into which the skelter alleged 
to belong to Chaim Aleuker had 
delivered him. Its privateer had 
been turned off, which fitted with 
the notion of a party open to all 
comers. The room, however, didn’t. 
At the far end were long tables over 
which were draped lumpy white 
cloths, concealing perhaps plates of 
food and glasses and bottles of 
liquor. On the walls were fine pic- 
tures of the sort one might imagine 
Aleuker buying. But there was no 
sound, not even music — nothing 
suggested a festive celebration. 

Had he, by some miracle, arrived

the whole affair a cruel hoax? One 
had heard that in the rarefied at- 
mosphere of vast wealth and privi- 
lege people developed a distorted 
sense of humor. 

Then a door opened and a pair of 
servants emerged: a footman and a 
maid in identical uniforms of green 
trimmed with white braid. Both of 
them were braced, of course; no 
one with free access to the skelter 
system had reason to accept menial 
employment. The girl had an ugly 
face — a scar ran down from her left 
temple to vanish under the high 
collar of her jacket. Nonetheless 
her figure was excellent: full- 
bosomed, small-waisted, broad- 
hipped. Hans wondered briefly why 
she had been so stupid as to get 
braced when she could have had 
her pick of a thousand eager men. 

The pair wished him a good eve- 
ning — yes, of course, here it must 
indeed be early evening — and the 
footman requested a look at the 
card that had brought him here. 
Having studied it, he asked Hans’s 
name, repeated it under his breath 
and beckoned the newcomer to- 
ward the windows. The maid drew 
the drapes aside. 

Revealed was a magnificent patio 
framed by greenery. Hans saw men 
and women in elegant clothing gaz- 
ing toward him with an air of ex- 
pectancy. 

His mouth went dry. He had left 
home in such haste he had not 
bothered to change his clothes: a 
short-sleeved shirt and crumpled 
pants of cotton drill, light enough 
to be tucked inside a climatized 
suit. His pockets bulged with his 
darkroom oddments. He was un- 



shaven and his hair was in a tangle. 

“This way, sir,” the footman 
urged. “My employer is eager to 
make your acquaintance.” 

It was too late to back down. The 
maid slid aside a section of the 
floor-to-ceiling window and Hans 
passed through to confront his 
host. 

N either man made any move to 
shake hands. The habit had 
gotten mislaid — there had been too 
many fatal contagious diseases. On 
the other hand, close friends kissed 
in public far more often than had 
been customary in the old western 
culture — a gesture that converted 
mere liking into willingness to 
share risks. Very strange. Hans 
cursed his head for being crowded 
with irrelevant data. All these 
faces, some white, some brown, 
some yellow ... 

“A great pleasure,” Aleuker was 
saying warmly. “I'm afraid I didn’t 
quite catch your name when my 
man repeated it.” 

“Hans Dykstra,” he heard him- 
self mutter. “I’m a recuperator, 
from — uh — ” 

He hesitated. Mentioning his 
profession was all right — it was re- 
spectable and respected, provided 
the practitioner was good at it. 
What he didn’t know was whether 
it was correct form to refer to one’s 
place of residence in a circle as 
exclusive as this one. Respect for 
privacy these days notoriously es- 
calated in proportion with the 
square of one’s wealth. 

But Aleuker was looking expec- 
tant, so he completed the state- 
ment.

“From Malta. Valletta, to be 
exact.” 

“Ah-hah? Haven’t been there for 
ages,” Aleuker said while Hans be- 
latedly considered a corollary to his 
last assumption: suppose that ob- 
session with the maintenance of 
privacy diminished as the means 
available to protect it increased? 
“Used to have a friend there. 
Maybe you know Christos Mi- 
callef?” 

Hans shook his head. 

“Lucky you. A thorough-going 
bastard — ” 

A bell chimed and Aleuker was 
suddenly looking past Hans. 

“Looks as though the rush is 
starting. I hope we didn’t underes- 
timate the numbers — we had the 
whole project computed. Well, 
that’s my headache, not yours. 
Have a drink, make yourself at 
home. Excuse me while I go wel- 
come number two.” 

Hans turned and recognized the 
second arrival. It was the girl he 
had nearly met at Oaxaca. Aleuker 
was grinning from ear to ear. His 
jubilation faded a little when her 
boy friend followed her. 

The incident should have been 
amusing. Hans, however, was in no 
mood to find anything funny. He 
felt as out of place here as a diehard 
Christian at a Way of Life ritual. 
Maybe he ought to leave again at 
once? 

No, the hell with that. He’d 
brazen it out for an hour at least, 
make himself scarce when his ab- 
sence had lasted long enough for 
Dany to have become contrite. His 
main purpose had been achieved — 
he was here. He had spoken to 



Aleuker personally. He fully ex- 
pected he would be forgotten again 
in five minutes and it wouldn’t 
worry anybody if he hung around in 
some quiet corner for a while. 

He advanced on a passing waiter, 
helped himself to a glass of wine 
and, turning away, found himself 
being smiled at by a genial man in 
blue suede. 

{{rviHANKS for winning me my 
X bet with Chaim,” the man 
said. “It’s not every day of the year 
one can take money off that fellow. 
He insisted, you see, that according 
to his computers — mine really, but 
what the hell — nobody would figure 
out those silly clues of his and 
arrive here before eight p.m. local. 
And then up you turn and blow his 
deadline to smithereens.” 

“Uh — did I?” Hans muttered, 
restraining himself from consulting 
his watch because it would show 
some utterly irrelevant hour. 

“Why, yes. You clocked in well 
under the wire,” the man in blue 
declared. “By the way, I’m Boris 
Pech. Did I hear you say you’re a 
recuperator?” 

“Not the Boris Pech?” Hans 
blurted. 

“What?” The older man blink- 
ed. “Oh — yes, I guess you might 
say so. Advancement Authority, if 
that’s what you mean. But I was 
about to ask you — do you ever work 
Europe, by any chance?” 

“Uh; — yes, now and then. When 
we get clearance to dig over a zone 
that's been pronounced free of 
plague and radiation.” 

“Ah. Then I wonder if you’ve 
come across anything that might 



40 



GALAXY 




help us out of a tight corner. We’ve 
combed North America, Russia, 
what little of Japan we can get at — 
without joy. Europe’s our last hope 
really, though I guess there may be 
something in Brazil — But of course 
Brazil is about the most unhealthy 
spot on the planet nowadays.” 

“So I’m told,” Hans muttered. 
There was even less news from the 
interior of South America currently 
than from Central Africa or China. 
Bloody wars were in progress there 
as a score of petty local lordlings 
tried to carve themselves new 
empires. 

“Well, the problem's this,” Pech 
went on. “A bunch of us landed a 
skelter on the moon last year, as 
you know,- and doubtless you’ve 
been wondering why so far we 
haven’t made any use of the damn 
thing.” 

Hans nodded. He’d heard about 
that venture, announced as the first 
earnest of man’s ability to surpass 
the scientific achievements of the 
pre-skelter period. But he had 
never expected to find himself 
chatting casually with one of the 
experts responsible. 

F ar off in his memory resonated 
something Dany had flung at 
him in a moment of inspiration 
during one of their quarrels and 
luckily never had the wit to repeat. 
It had wounded him. She had 
charged that he was forever grovel- 
ling at the feet of the past, scared of 
doing anything that might shape 
the future, even his personal 
future. 

It was true he got little encour- 
agement to act otherwise. His con- 



tact with people who had new ideas 
and the leverage to put them into 
effect was limited to reporting on 
the caches of industrial goods he 
unearthed. His task was to describe 
and identify them, not dictate to 
what use they should be put. 

His one genuinely personal pro- 
ject would not be known until after 
his death — but that was merely 
sound sense. 

Aloud he said, “Yes, the point 
has been puzzling me. Why is it?” 

“Because our best measurements 
haven’t given us the transmission 
span closer than two centimeters 
plus or minus. Of course over such 
a long distance that’s too slack by 
an order of magnitude. Earthside 
the problem doesn’t exist — to be 
out by a couple of millimeters 
doesn’t signify and one can com- 
pensate automatically for crustal 
tides and other minor nuisances. So 
what we’ve all been dreaming of is a 
batch of those ultra-high-precision 
lasers that Zeiss of Jena were al- 
leged to be working on when — ” 

Hans let him rattle on. He had 
not had the vaguest notion that the 
moon’s distance had been mea- 
sured to within two centimeters, 
but he wasn’t about to admit it. 
Nor, come to that, was he going to 
do a lot of talking during the party. 
He was going to compel himself to 
listen. 

It was clear from the way Pech 
spoke that English was no more his 
mother tongue than it was Hans’s. 
Both he and Dany had been born to 
French and Flemish, he in Antwerp 
and she in a village near Liege. 

But Pech used this language with 
a fluency and vocabulary that made 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



41 




Hans sound like a backward 
schoolboy, even though he had de- 
creed to Dany when they first were 
married that they should use 
English in private as well as in pub- 
lic. She had agreed that the 
proposal was sensible. English was 
the first or second language of more 
people who had survived the Blow- 
up than any other. But it sat un- 
comfortably on his mind and he re- 
mained terribly aware of how small 
an area of its immense richness he 
had learned to exploit. And if Pech 
was typical of Aleuker’s friends . 

H e was. So Hans stuck by his 
resolution and almost at once 
found it was both an advantage — 
for a patient listener was automa- 
tically defined as charming — and a 
shame. He seldom got along easily 
with strangers and he had fully ex- 
pected these friends of Aleuker’s to 
regard their treasure hunt as a 
joke. But they were not in the least 
patronizing. They clearly assumed 
that anybody who had solved the 
cryptic clues deserved to be treated 
as an equal. 

Hans knew a warm glow. Almost 
he was tempted to mention what 
one day would add his own name to 
the roster of the famous — but he 
caught himself. (What the hell kind 
of wine was this anyhow?) 

Never mind. To be treated by the 
members of this in-group as an 
equal, however temporarily, was an 
accolade. News had begun to be ac- 
ceptable again during the past de- 
cade or so. as the race’s psycho- 
logical sores had begun to heal and, 
with the dissolution of nations, in- 
dividuals now made the headlines. 



Such individuals, in fact, as these: 
“Fred, have you met Hans who was 
the first to find the party?” And 
Fred was the Okinawan scientist 
Frederick Satamori, deputy direc- 
tor of the Skelter Authority — what 
would he think if he knew himself 
to be face to face with a criminal? 
And: “Ingrid dear, I hear you lost 
your cats! Does that mean there are 
none left now?” And Hans found 
himself commiserating with Dr. In- 
grid Castelnuovo, the biologist who 
had just failed to rescue the domes- 
tic cat from extinction and who was 
so much farther along the Way of 
Life he was half-ashamed to admit 
his own adherence to the faith. 

He had imagined these persons 
to be unreal, unapproachable. Yet 
these dozen-odd personalities, 
Aleuker’s closest friends, the win- 
nowings of a vast acquaintance- 
ship, were mingling contentedly 
with the strangers who kept pour- 
ing out of the unprivateered skelter. 
Many were shy, plainly retiring 
men of advanced years who must 
have been through agonies of inde- 
cision before concluding that a 
chance to meet Chaim Aleuker 
made it worth taking advantage of 
the clues their scholarship enabled 
them to decipher. Some were arro- 
gant young student types clearly 
determined to prove they were a 
match for their elders. Several 
pretty un-bright girls and a great 
many more pretty un-bright boys 
had ridden here on the shirttails of 
lovers with higher IQs. 

Fantastic. And a lot of fun. 
Hans’s self-allotted hour was nearly 
up. He revised his deadline and de- 
cided to stay at least as long again.

— Mustapha Sharif 

C heerfully adrift on stimulat- 
ing conversation, first-class 
liquor and delicious food — here in 
the far south the sea still bred safe 
fish and much of the ground could 
be farmed in the old-fashioned 
manner provided it was protected 
from rain — Hans gloated privately 
over his vision of tomorrow. 

He was going to make Dany 
weep, actually weep, with his vivid 
description of the unique occasion 
she had cheated herself out of by 
ruining his precious film — not, of 
course, that she would have figured 
out the clues that had led him here. 
He would imply, in terms broad 
enough for her not to misconstrue, 
that he would have been happy to 
escort her to the party, deftly link 
her into discussions beyond her 
range, help her to leave behind an 
impression that while that guy 
Dykstra’s wife might not be too 
much to look at she must be pretty 
bright behind that quiet facade. He 
had had to undertake similar 
chores for her throughout their 
marriage and he was confident he 



could have worked the trick even in 
this unprecedentedly distinguished 
company. 

He caught sight again of Fred- 
erick Satamori on the far side of the 
patio as he orbited from one pri- 
mary of conversation to the next, 
always welcome, and thought again 
of the enormity of the offenses he, 
Hans Dykstra, was committing by 
the scientist’s standards. 

This event would certainly have 
to be recorded in his secret files. 
One day somebody would read his 
account of this party and laugh . 

H e had hoped for another 
chance to speak to Aleuker. 
He had an opening gambit ready — 
the presence of many plants in tubs 
and pots on this broad patio hinted 
that the owner might follow the 
Way of Life. But the opportunity 
eluded him. Basking in adulation, 
the inventor seemed to be holding 
forth to a large group of admirers 
every time he passed within earshot 
of Hans — always a different group, 
but always the same subject, the 
privateer. 

“When I think of what would 
have happened to the world without 
it — ” someone said loudly and 
Hans cynically thought: What 
about what happened to the world 
in spite of it? 

Actually he experienced a silent 
shudder of agreement with the 
speaker. Stripped of virtually every 
other means of long-distance trans- 
port in the Blowup, mankind had 
had no viable alternative to the 
skelter. It was cheap, not very diffi- 
cult to build and extremely reliable. 
Yet it was in itself the cause of

the Blowup and was nearly de- 
stroyed in the aftermath. Within a 
decade of its introduction the skel- 
ter had turned sour. It had threat- 
ened to infect the human race with 
world-wide ochlophobia. 

Early models'had had to be open 
to anybody who punched the 
proper code, whether friend or 
enemy, because it cost tens of thou- 
sands to activate the power-crys- 
tals. They were not designed to be 
switched on and off, only to reso- 
nate in a permanent state of excite- 
ment. If they were turned off they 
had to be sent back to the factory to 
be energized again and that would 
set the owner back three-quarters 
of the initial outlay. 

In the terrible years immediately 
following the Blowup it had been 
touch and go whether any transpor- 
tation system would survive — or 
whether every skelter on Earth 
would be smashed by rioting mobs 
sick of having bandits, criminals, 
JD’s and even foreign soldiers pour- 
ing into their towns. The West had 
first hit on the idea of shipping 
saboteurs through the skelter into 
“enemy” territory, but when the 
East retaliated the privileged few 
who owned domestic skelters at 
that time lived — if they did live — to 
regret their investment. Skelters in 
the Combloc had all been public 
and under guard. 

Not that guarding them had 
made much difference in the long 
run . 

In the tortured belief that an in- 
vention made in his own country of 
Sweden had brought about the 
downfall of civilization, Prince 
Knud had been driven to create the 



doctrines of the Way of Life. He 
had scattered millions of copies in a 
hundred languages, at his own ex- 
pense, to the far corners of the 
globe — a plea from the heart that 
humanity should cease to chase 
after gods and ideologies, learn to 
accept reality, recognize this near- 
Ragnarok as no more than the sort 
of population crash any species 
must endure if it overbred. 

Pleading failed. It took Aleuker’s 
invention of the privateer to restore 
a semblance of sanity to the world. 

Barely in time the skelter ceased 
to be a menace and became the 
means of reconstruction, tying 
together the isolated fragments of a 
shattered civilization. Code-trading 
now was among the most heinous of 
twenty-first-century offenses, en- 
forced as much by public opinion 
as by the sketchy, disorganized 
laws still being cobbled together 
from the scraps of a dozen incon- 
sistent legal traditions. 

(At that house in Umea — had it 
been spies or saboteurs who mur- 
dered the Erikssons? Mustapha 
had been convinced at once. On re- 
flection, Hans found himself more 
ready to opt for criminals. Pris- 
oners on the run before the advent 
of the bracelet would willingly have 
killed to make good their escape — 
and even more willingly after its in- 
troduction. when the skelter was 
the only mode of getting away.) 

But life wasn’t intolerable today. 
The resources that remained were 
being well exploited and new ones 
were being discovered — and one’s 
friends might as conveniently live 
on another continent as across the 
street, which must be good. It 



44 



GALAXY 




would take a long time for mankind 
to digest its brutal lesson. At least, 
though, there was a culture that 
showed signs of evolving in a sane 
direction. 

Hans gave a sage though slightly 
tipsy nod, telling himself solemnly 
that he was the guest of a universal 
benefactor and must not resent the 
fact that scores of other people kept 
getting between him and his host. 

T ipsy? Might be a good idea to 
go check out the food on dis- 
play in the hall where he had first 
found himself. There had been 
quiet music here on the patio for 
some time — within the past few 
minutes the volume had been 
turned up and several couples were 
dancing. Moreover, bright lights 
hidden among the trees or mounted 
on the eaves of the roof had been 
switched on. He hadn’t noticed 
when darkness fell. 

He wandered indoors, possessed 
himself of a plate and allowed a ser- 
vant to load it with smoked 
reindeer venison, freshly cooked 
fish dressed with mayonnaise, and 
a crisp oriental salad, a typical con- 
temporary combination. Hunger 
had smashed most of the barriers of 
prejudice that used to keep national 
cuisines apart. He ate with relish, 
wishing that at home he could af- 
ford to combine foodstuffs from 
(hree different parts of the world at 
every meal. 

Having finished and taken yet 
another glass of wine from a circu- 
lating tray, he leaned back in his 
chair. It looked as though it were 
about time for him to quit at long 
last. He was midway along the re- 



ception hall, between the skelter 
and the windows that stood ajar to 
the patio. For perhaps thirty 
minutes or more no new arrivals 
had caused the bell to chime and 
the privateer had been reactivated. 
It would make good sense not to 
stretch his luck. 

Then, suddenly, all his resolu- 
tions dissolved in the blink of an 
eye. 

He happened to be looking to- 
ward a door set in the wall opposite 
when it opened a few centimeters 
and light fell on the face of a girl, 
large-eyed, shy as a fawn. She 
peered in, caught sight of him and 
at once made to shut the door 
again. 

Without conscious volition he 
found he had closed the distance 
between them and was smiling at 
her from less than arm’s length. 

He heard his voice say, “Hello.” 

She answered in a language he 
hadn’t heard for years — or rather, 
a dialect so close to the one he knew 
that he understood her perfectly. 
She muttered an excuse and tried 
to shut the door a second time. 

He checked her by thrusting out 
his arm and demanded fiercely, 
“Are you Dutch? Or Flemish?” 

Astonished, she let go of the edge 
of the door and jerked her head 
back, those wide dark eyes fixed on 
his face. 

“No — I’m from Brazil, but — ” 

Brazil? 

It was too much for him to figure 
out. She herself was too much — all 
he could concentrate on was her 
simply being here. She was not tall, 
but was slim and shapely under the 
plain long dress she wore. In sharp 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE

contrast to the gaudy finery of the 
other guests, the dress still let her 
be the loveliest woman present. 
Eloquent eyes, mouth generous, 
hair sleek and black, hands deli- 
cate, figure molding that dress de- 
lectably — in sum, she was beauti- 
ful. And young with it. She could 
have been any age from fourteen to 
twenty. 

“Why are you hiding?" he 
rapped in his mother tongue. He 
reached for her hand, amazed at 
his own boldness. “A girl as pretty 
as you should be the star of the 
party — come on!” 

For an instant she seemed in- 
clined to resist. Then she yielded 
and came out into the hall with the 
air of a wild animal, casting timid 
glances to every side. Hans was 
aware that he was the focus of at- 
tention. He relished the sensation. 

“You must have something to 
eat. Perhaps a glass of wine and — ” 
Solicitous words he hadn’t spoken 
for years flowed out of him and he 
was rewarded to hear her answer 
yes, yes please! 

It wasn’t Dutch she spoke, but 
the first cousin of Dutch — Platt- 
deutsch. How in the world did she 
come to speak a dialect like that in 
Brazil? 

From behind him, suddenly, 
came Chaim Aleuker’s voice: 
“Hans, I see you’ve found Barbara. 
Good luck to you — see if you can 
make her bloom a bit.” 

Hans started so violently he 
nearly spilled the plate of food he 
was loading for the girl. He swung 
around. But already Aleuker was 
past and vanishing in the direction 
of the patio. 



“So you’re called Barbara,” he 
said. 

The girl shook her head vigor- 
ously. “No, my name is Anneliese 
Schenker.” 

“But I’m sure Chaim called 
you — ” 

“It is a joke for him. He says that 
‘Barbara’ means ‘a wild girl’ — and 
he thinks I’m a savage.” 

There was a ring of anger in her 
voice — she set her shoulders back, 
clenched her fists and glared after 
Aleuker. 

Hans hesitated only a moment. 
Then he said, “I suspect you may 
want to tell somebody about your- 
self. And it cannot be easy to find 
people who speak your language. I 
do, more or less. Shall we go and sit 
over there out of the way? I promise 
I will listen to whatever you say.” 

He handed her the plate of food. 
She took it, her eyes on his face, 
and after a miniature eternity said, 
“Yes, please, sir. I would be so glad 
if I could talk to somebody properly 
instead of struggling with English 
that I only half understand.” 

Incredible, incredible! I'm hold- 
ing a tete-a-tete conversation with 
the girl every susceptible male in 
the place is eyeing . How did it 
happen? Never mind! Enjoy, enjoy! 

He concentrated on the tale she 
was unfolding. 

She did indeed come from Bra- 
zil. The reason she spoke a langu- 
age so close to his was that she was 
descended from a colony of Ger- 
man protestant fundamentalists 
who after World War I had decided 
they must cut themselves off from 



46 



GALAXY 




the fleshpots of wicked Europe and 
live a holy life in a new land. 

Hans’s mind boggled at the reali- 
zation that he was talking to a 
Christian. This was like being 
transported back in time! 

Refusing to accept cars, radios, 
telephones — let alone the skelter — 
with hand-axes and horse-ploughs 
they had built a flourishing little 
town a hundred miles from any- 
where and called it Festeburg — 
after a religious song, she ex- 
plained. 

They traded produce locally and 
once or twice a year they loaded a 
boat with vegetables, cloth and 
handicrafts and rowed it downriver 
to a market town where they bar- 
tered for tools, nails, wire and other 
goods, mostly metal, which they 
could not manufacture themselves. 
Aside from that they had no con- 
tact with the larger world. 

She had been told by her grand- 
father how news of the 1939 war 
reached the colony by word of 
mouth and the accident of a news- 
paper wrapped around a packet of 
seeds, and how the Predikant 
called everyone together for a day 
and a night and a day of nonstop 
prayer to avert God’s wrath from 
his most faithful worshipers. 

The trick must have worked. At 
any rate, World War II passed and 
nothing changed in Festeburg, 

Prayer was less successful in the 
case of an epidemic which struck 
the community and killed Anne- 
liese’s mother. The girl’s voice 
trembled . From her halting descrip- 
tions Hans deduced that the disease 
might have been influenza-M, third 
of the four deadly new strains 



hatched in the uplands of New 
Guinea which spread like wildfire 
after the introduction of the skel- 
ter. He didn’t inquire too closely, 
though. He was too busy marveling 
at the chance that had brought him 
an emissary from a past he had 
imagined lost forever. Until only a 
couple of months ago this girl had 
lived in the pre-skelter age. In cul- 
tural terms she had been farther re- 
moved from the modern world than 
the Erikssons whose bodies he had 
disposed of earlier today. Or had it 
been yesterday? 

“What happened to bring you 
here?” he urged. 

Bit by reluctant bit, she ex- 
plained. Somewhere in the Sertao a 
minor warlord had begun to carve 
out an empire in the usual manner. 
Among the places he coveted was 
the site of Festeburg. 

There had been a siege. Her 
father had been killed. Her older 
brother, then head of the family, 
had ordered her to take a canoe 
and paddle downriver in search of 
help. With unbelievable courage, 
considering she had never been 
farther from home than she could 
walk in half a day, she had obeyed. 

The first people she had come on 
were friends of Chaim Aleuker’s 
cocking a snook at the dangers of 
modem South America by taking a 
camping vacation with the aid of a 
portable skelter. (Hans pursed his 
lips at that. A traveling skelter had 
to incorporate its own range-finding 
gear and cost a million if you could 
find a technician able to build you 
one.) 

Aleuker’s people hauled her out 
of the river when her canoe sprang 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



47 




a leak after hitting a submerged 
snag, but they couldn’t talk to her 
until Aleuker turned up. She said 
she thought it was a miracle when 
he stepped from the coffin-sized 
box in the middle of the campsite. 
She had literally never dreamed of 
a skelter before. 

But she thought it was even more 
miraculous when it turned out 
Aleuker spoke Yiddish and was 
able to communicate with her in a 
rudimentary fashion. She had been 
aware that other languages existed 
apart from the German dialect 
spoken at Festeburg, for the traders 
they dealt with spoke corrupt Por- 
tuguese, but girls were forbidden to 
talk to strangers. 

Having puzzled out her story, 
Chaim persuaded his companions 
to collect their guns and set off for 
Festeburg. When they arrived 
there, however, they found it 
burning, its inhabitants extermi- 
nated. 

Well — too bad! Everyone in the 
group had business to attend to and 
their vacation was too near its close 
for them to bother about the de- 
parted warlord and his troops. So 
in sheer despair, shaking with 
terror, she had let Chaim lead her 
into the skelter and bring her here. 

In other words: to a place that, 
according to everything she had 
been brought up to believe, was a 
fair facsimile of hell.

P erhaps it was unfair to Aleu- 
ker — perhaps Hans was adding 
unjustified highlights to what the 
girl told him and in fact she was 
seeing rapists around every corner 
as a result of her appalling heri- 
tage — but the impression was quite 
clear that when Aleuker discovered 
Anneliese wasn’t minded to pile 
straight into bed and make wild 
jungle love he lost interest. 

One would assume that Aleuker 
had a normal appetite for women — 
indeed, one had heard that because 
of his fame he had enjoyed far more 
of them than his proper share. 
Serious for a moment, Hans won- 
dered what it would be like to be in 
Aleuker's shoes, welcomed as a 
father for the babies of women 
around the world. Those lucky po- 
tential mothers who had proved to 
be naturally immune to CPF — as 
Dany was not; and in consequence 
she had been compulsorily steri- 
lized — picked and chose their 
mates regardless of marriage, com- 
plying with constant and stern offi- 
cial warnings about letting the best 
of the gene pool go to waste. 

Once, three years ago, without 



48 



GALAXY 




informing Dany, Hans had adver- 
tised himself as a sire in one of the 
crudely printed contact journals 
(hat circulated from continent to 
continent. With so few people re- 
maining it had seemed a shame 
that he, Hans Dykstra, should 
leave behind no child at all, 
whether or not he could bring it up 
personally. 

But the only girl who had 
answered had failed to show at the 
rendezvous he’d proposed in Can- 
berra — and he had felt so silly he 
had never repeated the experiment. 

He now put the memory once 
more out of his mind and composed 
himself to go on listening. 

Anneliese had clung to Aleuker 
purely because she hadn’t known 
where else to go. Like most Chris- 
tians she had been taught to believe 
that even the followers of heretic 
branches of her own faith were 
children of the Evil One and 
eternally damned, so finding her- 
self in a world full of what she 
termed heathens, who drank 
liq uor, smoked, fornicated and 
bowed down to false gods, specifi- 
cally to trees and animals, had 
come close to driving her out of her 
mind. 

Only the fact that she hadn’t 
spoken to anybody for weeks — bar 
a few sour exchanges with Aleuker 
und his servants — had impelled her 
tonight to look in on the party, as 
she had been told to do. All the 
time she was talking her eyes kept 
darting from the sight of one abom- 
ination to another, and her cheeks 
remained pale as paper. 

When he had the chance, Hans 
demanded to know how old she 



was. She muttered, “Seventeen. 
Eighteen soon.” 

At that age, to have seen her 
father killed, her home burned, all 
her friends slaughtered . Her 
story echoed an ancient nightmare 
of Hans’s. He himself had been or- 
phaned in the last epidemic of CPF 
and had watched his mother die 
screaming. Though he had been 
taken in by kindly foster parents in- 
stead of being dumped in one of the 
children’s camps that were the 
breeding ground for twenty-first- 
century crime, his loss retained the 
power to wake him weeping in the 
night even now when he was well 
past thirty. 

Dany had never sympathized 
with him, only complained at 
having her own sleep disturbed. 

But he suspected that this girl 
might understand, instead of 
mocking a grown man for shedding 
tears. 

S uddenly, with no warning, 
came a loud noise. The conver- 
sation flowing merrily in and 
outside the hall snapped short like 
a dry stick trod on by a heavy foot. 

Somebody said into the silence 
that followed, “Hell, that was a 
gun—” 

There was a concerted rush to- 
ward the sliding windows giving ac- 
cess to the patio — followed instant- 
ly by a melee as those wanting to go 
out met those wanting desperately 
to come in. 

A confused sound of shouting 
rose. The guests pushed and milled 
and Anneliese laid her hand on 
Hans’s, whispering, “Is something 
wrong?”

He relished the touch of her fin- 
gers, so light, so warm, yet seeking. 
It was as though, through the 
touch, the essence of her fresh 
youthful body had permeated all 
his senses. The impact on him was 
like a drug. 

Rising, daring to lay his own 
hand on her soft hair in a gesture 
midway between a pat of reassur- 
ance and an overt caress, he said, 
“I'll ask somebody. Don’t worry — ” 

But he was too late. Another 
sharp noise cleft the air and a whole 
panel of taller-than-man sliding 
windows shattered. Hans had an 
instant vision of scores of mouths 
standing ajar in astonishment. 

And then everybody between him 
and the outside dove flat to the 
tloor, giving him a clear sight of 
what lay beyond. 

At the mouth of the little cove 
overlooked by Aleuker’s house a 
pair of small headlands bent to the 
sea, dark on dark but highlighted 
by the beams of a newly risen 
moon. 

Between them, as though tar- 
geted in the sight of a rifle, three 
clusters of bright red-yellow flame 
admired their own reflections in the 
water. 

The music had stopped. One 
could hear yells of savage anger. 
The wavering flames fell into place 
in Hans’s mind. 

War canoes! 

H e had been vaguely aware for 
years that among the Maoris — 
as among individuals of virtually 
every ethnic group that had con- 
trived to preserve a precarious iden- 
tity distinct from the otherwise all- 



pervading culture of the Christian 
West — there was a violent new cult 
dedicated to vengeance. Its mem- 
bership was made up of relatively 
few unassimilated Maoris, how- 
ever, though their ranks had been 
swelled by half-caste defectors from 
the white-biased culture of New 
Zealand. He had never expected 
that these malcontents would be 
the people to launch an attack — 
and trap him in it. 

But then he had only been to 
New Zealand tw ice before. 

A long time seemed to pass, 
though it could only have been a 
few heartbeats, during which Hans 
felt his jaw hang foolishly loose, his 
gape matching that of everybody 
else in view. The moment of paral- 
ysis was ended this time by a bar- 
rage of shots and a scream that 
peaked to a treble — though it 
began in baritone— the voice of a 
man in mortal agony. 

The war canoes had reached the 
shore and the torches were heading 
for the house. Rhythmic chanting 
rang out, paced by the stamp of 
many feet. As though terror had 
endowed him with telescopic vision, 
Hans saw a score of nearly naked 
brown men, some clutching guns, 
others spears, with necklaces of 
human teeth around their necks. 

He listened as, at the top of his 
voice, Aleuker shouted, “Keep 
calm! I have machinegun posts — ’’ 

The words were cut short by the 
sewing-machine vibration of those 
guns, but the attackers had already 
achieved part of their goal. Three 
of the guests were coughing away 
their lifeblood on Aleuker’s beauti- 
ful patio. Others were sobbing and 



50 



GALAXY 




moaning from minor injuries. And 
now the torches — soaked in oil, no 
doubt — were being put to their 
proper purpose. They arched 
through the air and landed on the 
roof of the house. 

“Sir, please — what is happen- 
ing?” Anneliese whimpered, clutch- 
ing at Hans. 

He recovered his presence of 
mind with an effort, glanced down 
at her and in the same moment saw 
that the skelter was a mere five 
steps away. It wouldn’t be more 
than a few seconds before someone 
else thought of making a run for it. 

“Come on!” he said sharply, 
dragging the girl to her feet. He 
pushed her furiously toward their 
way of escape. 

‘‘But 1 don't want to — ” 

“Stay and you’ll get killed — ’’ 
Hans forced her into the booth, his 
fingers automatically seeking the 
code for his home at Valletta. No 
time now to think of what Dany 
would say — all that mattered was 
(light. 

Howls, shots, the crackle of 
flames taking hold, all vanished 
instantly — 

And Anneliese screamed. 

Hans wanted to, as well. 

They were in his hallway. Facing 
the skelter, in the same chair where 
she had awaited his return from 
Sweden, as though she had ar- 
ranged herself with care to be abso- 
lutely the first thing his eyes lit 
on — Dany. 

Or rather, Dany’s body. 

She had cut her wrists and was 
saturated waist to feet with drying 
blood.

THE HOOK , 
THE EYE AND 
THE WHIP 



The prisoner had lost his life, 
yet he was doomed to live it! 

MICHAEL G. CONEY 



O ften in the spring evenings I 
would stroll down to the Skip- 
per’s Marina in Dollar Bay and 



54 



watch the bonded S.P. men work- 
ing on their bosses’ boats. I would 
chat with them as they scraped, 
painted and varnished, and try to 
discover what made them tick. In 
general they were a cheerful lot and 
it was rarely that a man would 
openly admit that he was dissatis- 
fied, or that he wished he had never 
elected to be bonded. Indeed, it 
was not always obvious that an S.P. 
man was bonded — for the rough 
work in the boat yards he wore 
coveralls with the letters S.P. front 
and back, just as did any other 
State Prisoner. 

Perhaps the most interesting of 
these characters was Charles, Doug 
Marshall’s man. I would see him at 
work even on weekends, scraping 
and filling, preparing the boat for 
the coming season while the Free- 
men and their chattering wives 
wandered about the slipway and 
the wharves, grotesque marine pets 
flopping at their heels. These week- 
ends had become social events, 
each Freeman trying to outdo his 
fellow in hearty commendation of 
his own sleek boat, while the wives 
vied over such niceties as minipile 
cookers and autoflush heads. They 
would stand beside their boats, 
these Freemen would, patting them 
and stroking them like racehorse 
owners, meanwhile barking in- 
structions at their bonded men. 

Even Carioca Jones appeared on 
occasion — once she came wearing 
the slitheskin dress I had made for 
her the previous autumn and the 



emotion-sensitive skin turned a 
faint pink as our eyes met and we 
both thought of Joanna. Her 
young, smooth hands rose to her 
vulture’s throat almost of their own 
accord, while her hard black eyes 
wrinkled in a smile. 

“I must say I’m surprised to see 
you here, Joe, knowing your views,” 
she greeted me. 

“I like to look at the boats.” 

“Yes, but all these — people, dar- 
ling. Aren’t they simply terrible?" 

“No worse than anyone else, I 
guess,” I said coldly, wishing she 
would move on. 

Carioca Jones was ostensibly a re- 
formed character since the incident 
last year that had caused the entire 
Peninsula to ostracize her socially — 
a bitter blow for the ex-3-V star. 
Predictably for a woman of her 
drive and personality, she had 
thrown herself into a round of 
social do-gooding by way of atone- 
ment and was expected to become 
the next president of the Foes of 
Bondage Association, which had 
been making its presence felt 
around the Peninsula recently. 

Unfortunately, anyone meeting 
her for the first time always com- 
mented on what beautiful hands 
she had for her age — and some- 
where in the squalid workshops of 
the State Prison an S.P. girl named 
Joanna was now stitching coveralls 
with steel fingers. 

One Friday afternoon in May I 
left the slithe farm in the capable 
hands of Dave Froehlich, my 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



55 




bonded man, and walked down to 
the Marina. By now the boats were 
in good shape — most of the paint- 
work having been completed — and 
the S.P. men were working on 
decks and below, polishing brass, 
overhauling e’ngines. About twenty 
hydrofoils stood in line on their in- 
sect legs, looking virile and rakish. 

Aione among the S.P. men, 
Charles was working on the outside 
hull of his boss’s boat, lubricating 
the heavy rollers of the Eye. I 
walked over and greeted him. He 
looked up from his work. 

“Hi, Joe,” he said. That was one 
of the things I liked about him. He 
was able to treat me as an equal 
and whenever I talked with him I 
forgot that he was a State Prisoner 
and I a Freeman. 

Unlike my foreman Dave, who 
will address me as “Mr. Sagar” no 
matter how often I tell him to use 
my Christian name. Dave is a good 
man, but he will go on hating me 
until his time is served. Nothing 
personal about it — I just happen to 
be a Freeman. 

“When are you going to get her 
in the water?” I asked Charles. 

“About three weeks’ time, I reck- 
on.” He stood, wiped his hands on 
his coveralls and gripped the huge 
steel loop of the Eye in both hands. 
He pulled, extending it on well- 
greased runners until it projected 
some eight feet from the hull of the 
boat, a giant polished metal D. He 
grinned at me and tapped it with a 
small hammer — it rang like a bell. 



Rumor had it that an Eye frac- 
tured in use down south somewhere 
last summer, although the accident 
was hushed up. A sling-glider must 
have complete confidence in his 
equipment. Satisfied, Charles gave 
the Eye a seemingly gentle push. 
Four hundred and twenty pounds 
of glittering steel-titanium alloy 
rolled smoothly back into the hull 
of the boat, the flat upright of the 
D — the outermost part of the Eye — 
fitting so snugly with the contours 
of the hull that the joining could 
hardly be seen. 

Charles turned his attention to 
the Whip, which lay on the slipway 
beside the boat and stretched to a 
small mooring buoy out in the 
water — a total distance of some 
eighty yards. This year everyone 
had bought new Ultrafiber-X 
Whips — they lay rigid across the 
surface in parallel green lines. 

‘‘What do you think about, 
Charles?” I asked curiously. 
“When Doug’s up in his glider and 
the Hook hits the Eye — what 
thoughts occur to you?” 

He grinned, kneading grease into 
the attachment where the Whip 
joined the pilot’s harness. “There’s 
no time to think. I’m too busy 
pinning down the Whip, rolling out 
the Eye, trying to control the boat 
at the same time — while I listen to 
some damfool observer panicking 
in the stern.” 

I smiled, too. I had crewed for 
Doug Marshall as observer and had 
panicked when I thought the sling- 



56 



GALAXY 




glider had gotten out of control. 

“But there’s one thing I never 
think about.” continued Charles. 
“You want me to say I worry about 
Doug’s getting hurt, don’t you?” 

“It must occur to you.” 

“It doesn’t. You’d have to be a 
glider pilot yourself to understand . 
I used to be a pilot a few years 
back. It’s a new sport — we’ve got a 
lot to learn — but it’s a great sport. 
Joe — there’s nothing like the thrill 
of being up there in that little glider 
that’s hardly bigger than yourself — 
at two hundred and fifty miles per 
hour.” 

Charles stood over six feet, blond 
and weatherbeaten — he looked the 
sling-glider type, though hardly the 
State Prisoner type. Doug Marshall 
had told me about that once. 
Charles had been sentenced for 
rape, of all things, after some inci- 
dent on board his boat. I personally 
thought the whole thing sounded 
unlikely and obviously the judge 
had had his doubts, too — Charles 
only got four years. 

He had applied for bonding — 
which carries an automatic one- 
third sentence remission — after he 
had served the six months compul- 
sory. Doug Marshall had known 
him slightly in the past and had 
agreed to take him on. Charles was 
now bound by the terms of the one- 
sided contract to serve his master 
faithfully and well to the utmost of 
his ability, until the death of either 
party or completion of his sen- 
tence — whichever came sooner. 



The sling-glider pilot is entirely 
in his steersman’s hands. 

I looked at Charles. Surely he 
must think something while Doug 
was in the air in that flimsy glider. 

For example — he might think of 
Doug’s dying. If that happened 
Charles’ contract would be up and 
with it his sentence — he would be a 
free man. A Freeman. 

For example — he had to think of 
Doug’s possibly being seriously in- 
jured. In which case Charles would, 
as ever, be required to serve Doug 
to the utmost. 

Which might mean the donation 
of an organ. 

Charles worked on impassively, 
talking technicalities as he checked 
and greased Doug Marshall’s har- 
ness. 

I t is difficult to define an air of 
suppressed excitement. It can 
be observed most easily, perhaps, 
in the way people will suddenly ad- 
dress comparative strangers, ask- 
ing their views on whatever is 
causing the furor. Such an air was 
in evidence at the Skipper’s Marina 
during those last few weeks before 
the start of the sling-gliding season. 
Freemen talked of competitions 
and Freewomen spoke of the 
clothes they would wear at the Pres- 
ident’s Opening Scratch Trophy — 
while at their feet, brought into un- 
accustomed proximity, land sharks 
fought German shepherds, pet oc- 
topi devoured micropekes. 

The sloping landscape of the 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



57 




long slipway was busy every day 
and crowded on weekends when the 
owners arrived to assist or berate 
their S.P. men, according to per- 
sonality, Huge boats towered every- 
where. Men scuttled underneath 
with paintbrushes* and powertools, 
putting on finishing touches. 

I frequently dropped by on Sun- 
day afternoons to assist Marshall. 
For a few hours I breathed sawdust 
and cellulose as we cleaned up the 
boat's interior — then we drank beer 
with him and Charles in the dim 
cabin as slow nightfall came. Some- 
times other boat owners would 
climb the ladder, hammer on the 
cabin roof and shout a greeting, 
then squeeze into the small cabin to 
share our beer and prolong the 
party past midnight. 

On the last Sunday before the 
season began Carioca Jones came 
again to the marina, spectacularly 
dressed, land shark flopping at her 
heels. The brute was growing fast — 
by now he was over six feet long. 
Doug Marshall was bent double 
and sweating as he adjusted the 
shear-pin on one of the props, when 
the land shark undulated over to lie 
beside him and watch him coldly, 
stinking like a fishmarket. The im- 
planted oxygenator caused its gills 
to pulsate unpleasantly. Doog 
caught sight of the fish suddenly, 
straightened and cracked his head 
on the keel. 

He had not liked Carioca Jones 
since the Joanna episode and now 
he exploded. “Get that bastard 



away from me before I put this drill 
through its skull!” He brandished 
his whirring powertool like a 
rapier. 

Carioca hurried over and laid a 
hand on her pet’s collar. She was 
wearing slitheskin gloves — prod- 
ucts of my small factory — and I 
noticed they had turned mauve in 
sympathy with her temper. “Wil- 
berforce is quite harmless.” She 
spoke coolly enough. “There’s no 
call to lose your temper with him. 
Mr. Marshall. He wasn’t doing 
anything wrong.” 

“Wrong.” Doug was massaging 
his scalp. “The swine nearly frac- 
tured my skull for me.” 

“Come now, Mr. Marshall. A 
big brave sling pilot shouldn’t be 
frightened of a mere land shark, 
should he now?” 

Doug recovered slightly, swal- 
lowed hard and spoke carefully. 
"Miss Jones, that fish is a menace. 
He’s been allowed to grow too big. 
Look at those teeth. He could have 
your leg off without batting an eye- 
lid. You ought to have him put 
down.” 

“Put down?” Carioca’s gloves 
were purple and trembling. Doug 
met her stare levelly. She looked 
elsewhere for a scapegoat and , as I 
was edging out of the scene, 
Charles descended the ladder from 
the cockpit and glanced at the pro- 
tagonists with interest. He was 
wearing his State Prison coveralls. 
Carioca’s gaze lit on the letters S.P. 
and her eyes flashed. “Oh, so you 



58 



GALAXY 




have a slave here doing your work 
for you.” 

The abrupt change of subject 
foxed Doug. “What the hell’s that 
got to do with it?” he asked, 
baffled. “Anyway, Charles is my 
bonded man.” 

“Oh, a bonded man, is he? I 
might have guessed. No wonder you 
love sling-gliding. Who wouldn’t, 
with a spare-parts man standing 
by?” 

Doug’s eyes widened. He looked 
at Charles, who seemed to have 
been struck speechless. I couldn’t 
think of much to say myself — 
arrant bad taste has that effect on 
me. Fortunately help was at hand 
in the unlikely guise of the club sec- 
retary, who happened to be pass- 
ing. He stepped in quickly. 

“Miss Jones, did I hear you 
rightly?” 

“Who are you, you strange little 
man?” 

Bryce Alcester, secretary of the 
Peninsula Sling-gliding Club, 
flushed. “I think I heard you use an 
expression we don’t like around 
here. Miss Jones. Was I right? Did 
you use such an expression?” He 
was a small man with a face like a 
beaver, but he had reserves of de- 
termination. 

“Of course you don’t like the ex- 
pression, because it’s true. How 
else can men like you summon the 
nerve to go up in those nasty little 
gliders?” 

“I must ask you to leave the 
premises, madam. I must also re- 



mind you that you are not a 
member.” 

“And I must tell you that the 
Foes of Bondage will picket the 
President’s Trophy next week. You 
haven’t heard the last of this, not 
by a long way.” 

Reluctantly, with Alcester’s hand 
on her arm, she began to move 
away. Her eye caught mine. 
“Really, Joe, I can’t think why you 
associate with such cowards.” 

After seeing her off the premises 
Alcester hurried back to us. There 
was a tear in the leg of his pants 
where the land shark had taken a 
snap at him. “I’m terribly sorry, 
gentlemen.” He looked at Charles, 
swallowed and said awkwardly, 
“And, uh, I would like to apologize 
to you, Charles, on behalf of the 
club.” 

Charles smiled blandly. ‘‘I’ve 
been called names before.” 

Later that evening as we drank 
beer in the cabin I asked Charles, 
“What does it really feel like to be 
called — what Carioca called you?” 
I must have had several drinks by 
then. 

Charles grinned. “Always trying 
to pump me, aren’t you, Joe? I 
often wonder if you’re a revolution- 
ary on the quiet, gathering infor- 
mation.” 

“Maybe, but I’m not a Foe of

“But Carioca Jones is right, you 
know,” he. said surprisingly. “I am 
a spare-parts man. I’ve wagered my 
body against a shorter sentence. I

went into it with my eyes open and 
so far I’ve been lucky. I’ve still got 
all my limbs and other items. And I 
don’t mind Doug’s sling-gliding, 
because I’ve done it myself and I 
know the thrill of it. Now that’s 
where Carioca Jones is wrong. I 
know that we would glide whether 
or not, uh, spare parts were avail- 
able. Miss Jones doesn’t know that. 
She can’t. She’s a woman.” 

I addressed Doug, pushing it a 
bit further. “Doug, suppose you 
smashed yourself up and you 
needed, say, a leg. Would you use 
Charles? Or would you spend the 
rest of your life limbless, watching 
Charles walk about whole?” 

“The beer has brought honesty,” 
said Doug quietly. “And I can say 
in honesty that I don’t know. And 
it’s one thing about myself I never 
want to know.” 

II 

I n the last days before the first 
race I had become totally in- 
fected with the sling-gliding fever. 
Up to then I had had no intention 
of competing despite Doug Mar- 
shall’s hints about the difficulty he 
was having in finding a competent 
observer. I spent most afternoons 
and every evening on the slipway, 
helping with the feverish last- 
minute preparations. Sling-gliding 
has this in common with any sport 
where complex equipment is used: 
no matter how careful the prepara- 
tions, no matter how long ago such 



preparations started, there is al- 
ways a panic at the finish. The 
Skipper’s Marina had put its truck 
at the disposal of the club and the 
vehicle was in constant use, com- 
muting between Louise and the 
marina with suddenly remembered 
necessities. 

. Carioca Jones did not appear, al- 
though there were rumors from 
time to time of the form the pick- 
eting was going to take. Some said 
that the Foes of Bondage had hired 
a boat and intended to upset the 
racing by zigzagging across the 
course on the pretext that the sea 
was free to all. Then, a couple of 
days before the first race, they were 
seen with their banners and plac- 
ards boarding a plane for Lake 
William in the far north. It seemed 
that some idiots were going to walk 
the glacial coast as far as Wall Bay, 
a distance of several hundred miles. 
There were three bonded men and 
a doctor in the party of ten — it was 
reported that the doctor was taking 
a full set of surgical instruments 
along in case someone suffered 
severe frostbite. Not only that, but 
there were backup parties hover- 
trucking supplies to remote rendez- 
vous where the terrain was too 
broken and the weather too severe 
to allow aircraft to get in. The per- 
sonnel for this hazardous task had 
been hired from the State Prison. 

On the Thursday, under pressure 
from Doug, Charles and several 
beers, I agreed to join Doug’s crew 
as observer. That evening I stayed 



60 



GALAXY 




late at the marina. I had — later — a 
hazy recollection of a party devel- 
oping in the cramped space of 
somebody’s cabin — but first I 
awoke with a powerful headache 
and a desire to be sick, to find that 
I was lying on the floor in un- 
familiar surroundings. 1 crawled to 
my feet, got as far as the door and 
poked my head out into the chill 
night air. 

After a few deep breaths I felt 
better. 1 glanced around the cabin 
and saw a sleeping girl, partly 
clothed, on one of the berths. Her 
mouth was hanging open and she 
was a mess — lipstick all over her 
face, hair matted. Crumpled 
around her throat was a slitheskin 
neckerchief, its dull brown hue tes- 
tifying the extent to which she was 
drained of emotion. I hoped it 
wasn’t I who had drained her and 
thought briefly of Charles and his 
rape case — and of how easy it is to 
transgress the law these days. 

I shut the cabin door quietly 
behind me and stood in the cockpit 
of the beached hydrofoil, allowing 
the night breezes to cool my head. I 
felt sweaty and stale. It occurred to 
me that technically I was tres- 
passing by being in the Skipper’s 
Marina after the club was closed 
and without having a sleep-in per- 
mit. Since the shortage of State 
Prisoners — which hit the country 
last autumn — there has been a 
tightening up in various facets of 
the law and I’m not sure that tres- 
pass isn’t one of them. I stepped 



over the cockpit coaming, found 
the ladder and climbed quietly 
down to the slipway. 

The next thing I did was to trip 
over the Whip of the unknown boat 
and fall flat and noisily on my face. 
Whips are of incredible lightness 
and rigidity, particularly this sea- 
son’s improved models. The end of 
this particular Whip must have 
been balanced on a box — anyway, 
it followed me to the ground with a 
ringing clatter that set up a sym- 
pathetic resonance throughout its 
entire eighty-yard length, causing it 
to protest with a wail that must 
have come close to awakening the 
very fossils under the sedimentary 
mud of which the Peninsula is com- 
posed. 

As I lay there trying not to vomit 
a scurrying, rustling noise came 
nearby and the hair at the nape of 
my neck prickled. The brute who 
made that noise could have been 
anything — Carioca Jones’ appalling 
land shark was quite innocuous 
compared with some of the bizarre 
pets I had seen that spring. It was 
becoming unsafe to leave one’s car 
or house at night, since many of the 
creatures, unsuited to human com- 
pany, had escaped and were roam- 
ing the flat countryside, fighting 
one another and attacking man on 
sight. 

I lay still and waited. The sounds 
continued: an uneven series of foot- 
steps — or some sort of steps — an 
occasional clatter of a can of paint 
or similar slipway debris being 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



61 




knocked over and a vocal gasping 
noise I tried to tell myself was 
human. Encouragingly, the sounds 
began retreating and soon they 
faded away. I heard the distant 
whine of a hovercar starting up — 
then that too receded and all was 
quiet again. 

Obviously there had been a tres- 
passer among the boats. In the 
morning someone would find his 
paintwork scored or his rudder 
pintles loosened. That sort of thing 
annoys me — I just can't see the 
sense in it. I wished I’d had the 
courage to tackle the intruder. 

Twenty minutes later I was driv- 
ing through my farm gates. I got 
out of the car and listened. Every- 
thing seemed to be in order; the 
reptiles were uttering that bubbling 
sound that characterizes the con- 
tented slithe. Relieved, I made for 
the house. Recently I’ve been 
having trouble again with otters 
getting into the pens and carrying 
off the slithes and I had mentioned 
to Dave the necessity for strength- 
ening our defenses. Increasingly 
there are dangerous predators at 
large on the Peninsula. 

T he following morning Dave and 
I made a tour of inspection. 
The little reptiles were in good 
shape, trotting about with a faintly 
red tone to their skins, the shade 
that denotes happiness and, pre- 
sumably, health. As we threw the 
fodder over the chicken wire the 
slithes scurried forward, turning 



pink with pleasure and feeding vo- 
raciously. Dave gave one of his rare 
grins. Then, noticing me testing the 
strength of the chicken wire with 
my foot, his manner assumed its 
accustomed seriousness. 

“I heard a rumor yesterday,” he 
said. “Someone saw a garden bar- 
racuda loose over Long Beach way. 
This guy was walking along the 
nature trail at the back of the la- 
goon there and the bastard came 
for him straight out of the bushes, 
all snapping teeth — you know what 
they’re like. It’s getting serious. 
There are things running wild all 
over the place.” 

“I was thinking about that last 
night. Perhaps you’d get one of the 
men to double the wire. It’s a good 
thing the brutes can’t live long.” 

He glanced at me. “You haven’t 
heard about the new oxygenator 
they’ve been implanting recently? 
It doesn’t have to be renewed. They 
say it stimulates the gills into a 
modified operation. They do a bit 
of surgery on the beast as well, and 
then the fish or whatever is totally 
adapted to living on land for the 
rest of its life.” 

“I don’t like the sound of that,” I 
said. The possibilities this develop- 
ment opened up were somewhat 
alarming. At this moment a car 
drove up and saved me further 
anxiety on the subject. 

“Hi, Joe darling.” Carioca Jones. 

“I thought you were up in the 
snow somewhere,” I said tactlessly. 

‘‘Joe, it was the most idiotic 



62 



GALAXY 




hoax! Someone sent me a transcrip- 
tion of a Newspockct report up at 
Lake William and it sounded like 
the most heartrending thing. 
Dozens of poor S.P. men are sup- 
posedly being used as nothing 
better than pack animals. And 
there were some bonded men with 
the actual party, going across the 
glaciers — you know what frostbite 
is — and they had a surgeon with 
them as well. My dear, the report 
was positively sinister. I mean, you 
know and I know that I’ve learned 
my lesson and we both think these 
transplants are abominable. Bar- 
baric.” 

“Yes,” I said carefully, not 
looking at her hands. 

“And when we got there with all 
our banners and placards nothing 
was happening! We marched down 
the street singing and everyone 
looked at us as though we were 
mad. And it was so cold — you’ve no 
idea! So we booked into the nearest 
hotel and I went to the local News- 
pocket agency — and do you know, 
they’d never even heard of the 
Great Arctic Trek, as it was sup- 
posed to be called.” 

“You must have been very dis- 
appointed.” 

She shot me a glance of birdlike 
suspicion but apparently my ex- 
pression satisfied her. “Quite — and 
it was dreadfully embarrassing. We 
hadn’t really allowed for the cold 
there. Some of my girls were frost- 
bitten quite badly. They were very 
upset and four of them resigned 



from the Foes for good.” 

I nearly asked her just how badly 
those four had been hurt and 
whether, if surgery had been neces- 
sary, they had contacted the near- 
est State Prison. As Foes of Bond- 
age, it was hardly likely they would 
have bonded S.P. girls. So if fingers 
were needed they would have to 
take their chances with the Ambu- 
latory Organ Pool — a euphemism 
for long-term prisoners first on the 
list of compulsory donors. I nearly 
asked her, but I didn’t. 

Instead I asked, “Are men 
allowed to join the Foes?” 

“Of course,” she said firmly. 
“Whyever not?” 

“I just wondered. The members 
all seem to be women.” 

“Oh, but that’s the way it works 
out, my dear. You see, it’s men who 
go in for these dangerous sports — 
it’s men who get smashed up and 
need transplants — so naturally men 
will support the status quo.” 
“Pardon me, Carioca, but that’s 
garbage. Only a fraction of the 
male population can afford to 
sling-glide or tramp through the 
Arctic.” 

“You men all stick together — 
that’s the trouble. Look at you, Joe. 
You admit you’re against legalized 
slavery, yet you’ve got your own 
bonded man and you’re friendly 
with lice like Marshall who risk 
someone else’s neck for fun. You 
wouldn’t join the Foes of Bondage 
if I begged you to, so I won’t 
bother.” 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



63 




J ust for the record, at this point 
I gave Carioca something from 
the depths of my soul, if I have one. 
“Dave Froehlich is a good man 
whom I rescued from that stinking 
prison — and I get no thanks from 
Dave. I’m friendly with Marshall 
because I enjoy his personality and 
to hell with his views — even if his 
views were unsound, which I doubt, 
I won't join the Foes because I’d be 
the only man there and people 
would look on me as a crank, 
added to which I don’t agree with 
the Foes’ methods. Regardless of 
whether or not the members are 
women, they are exactly the type of 
person I don’t like. Your members 
get a vicarious personal satisfaction 
from the annoyance they cause 
others. Their methods are wrong, 
in that they think it right to counter 
problems with problems.” 

Carioca Jones’ mouth had fallen 
agape. When I finished she hitched 
it up, thought a bit, then said, 
“You take the whole thing too 
seriously, Joe. The Foes are a club, 
that’s all. A woman’s club, if you 
will. This talk is nonsense. When 
we demonstrate we just think what 
fun it is to be doing it together. If it 
helps you any, Joe, I don’t think the 
members consider the objects of the 
Association as deeply as you seem 
to do.” 

“Then we need a new Associa- 
tion. Damn it, Carioca, they shout 
obscenities at people.” 

“Well, isn’t it fun to have the 
chance to shout obscenities at 



people without fear of any come- 
back?” 

I nearly lost my temper — and a 
good customer. “I’ve never felt any 
desire to shout obscenities at 
people. That’s the mentality of a 
teenage vandal.” 

She took my arm suddenly. “Oh, 
come on, Joe. Let’s not quarrel. I 
came to do business with you. You 
and I are on the same side, basi- 
cally. It’s people like your friend 
Marshall I don’t like. It was he who 
faked the Newspocket transcript, of 
course.” 

“Oh, come off it, Carioca.” 

“No, I mean it. It’s typical of his 
sense of humor. And I can tell you, 
it’s not so funny up at William 
Lake for a person of my age, Joe.” 
It was the first time I’d ever 
heard her mention her age. I 
changed the subject hastily. “You 
said you came to do business.” 

“Of course — you must be busy.” 
Her manner had become stiff. “I’d 
like to buy four dozen slitheskin 
wristlets, please.” 

“Four dozen?” 

“They’re for the Foes of Bond- 
age. We shall wear them at the 
demonstration tomorrow and they 
will show the solidarity of our feel- 
ings.” 

I had a mental image of four 
dozen Foes with fists upraised but 
with wristlets unfortunately show- 
ing colors of rainbow diversity. “Do 
you think it’s wise?” I ventured. 

“Look, Joe Sagar, do you want 
the business or don’t you?” 



64 



GALAXY 




Resignedly I took her into the 
showroom. While she was selecting 
the wristlets she persisted in asking 
about Charles, his crime, his sen- 
tence. She seemed to be trying to 
work up a feeling of pity for the 
man. 

II 

although the President’s tro- 
jf\.phy is the first event of the 
season and tends to be looked on as 
a mere hors d’oeuvre to the main 
course of races later in the summer, 
it is nevertheless an event worth 
winning. The psychological boost 
to the vistor will frequently start a 
winning vein in subsequent weeks 
that can be worth a good deal of 
prize money. And more than any 
other sport, sling-gliding depends 
on confidence. Confidence in one’s 
glider, one’s Whip, one’s boat, 
one’s observer and steersman — all 
of which comes with practice, but 
which is proved and improved by 
winning. 

Traditionally, the main body of 
spectators gathers along the ancient 
stone sea wall that was one of the 
few human artifacts on the Penin- 
sula to escape total destruction by 
the tidal waves of the Western 
Seaboard Slide. Here gather the 
curious, the casual, the enthu- 
siasts — and the Foes of Bondage. 
Out across the bay, a half-mile dis- 
tant, the gaunt pillar of the Ful- 
crum rises from the calm water. 

The Foes had already picketed 



the entrance to the marina, scream- 
ing their epithets at the hovercars 
as they arrived with pilots, crews 
and maintenance men. On stepping 
from my own vehicle I had been 
surprised when a woman I hardly 
knew thrust herself before me and 
referred to my slithe farm as a 
“plantation.” This was the latest 
dirty word unearthed by the Foes 
and apparently referred to some 
early phase of man’s relationship 
with his fellows. When I replied, 
rather weakly, that I didn’t plant 
anything at the farm — if the grow- 
ing of crops was what she objected 
to — she merely uttered a jeering 
noise and called me a “boss man.” 
Then Carioca Jones appeared. 
“My God, Joe,” she shrilled. “Do 
you mean to tell me you’re actually 
taking part in this pantomime?” 
Fortunately the press of the 
crowd had taken her away from me 
at this point, so I was spared the 
embarrassment of conversation. 

The President’s Trophy is a dis- 
tance/placement event and not 
strictly a race because the time fac- 
tor does not enter the judges’ calcu- 
lations — although the very fact of 
the high speeds attained during 
sling-gliding tend to cause the 
general public to refer to any event 
as a race. In this particular event 
the glider flies to a point out in the 
Strait, drops a marker and returns, 
the pilot endeavoring to land at a 
point as close as possible to the sea 
wall. A buoy, just offshore from the 
spectators, indicates the optimum. 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



65 




It is this finish close to the 
crowd — allied to the fact of its 
being the first event of the season — 
that gives the race its enormous 
popularity. 

By the time the boats were cruis- 
ing about, testipg their engines, the 
Foes of Bondage had positioned 
themselves at a point near the 
northern end of the sea wall, close 
to the marina. From time to time 
their president, an elderly woman — 
and, I supposed, the woman Cari- 
oca Jones hoped to supplant — 
whipped them into a frenzy with a 
few well-turned phrases. She had 
an imposing, almost puritanical 
presence that lent weight to her 
oracular delivery. From my position 
at the end of the slipway I couldn’t 
hear her words, but judging from 
the cheers of her supporters it was 
all good stuff. From time to time 
the Foes’ fists would curve forward 
and upward in a fair and feminine 
imitation of a right uppercut — sym- 
bol of the Association — but the 
wristlets remained neutral brown. 
You can’t fool slitheskin. Maybe 
the colors would come later, when 
the racing started. 

In the distance a hydrofoil was 
racing toward the Fulcrum. The 
crowd was still. Behind the boat a 
tiny glider rose into the sky. It was 
too far away for us to see the Whip 
as the boat snapped around the 
Fulcrum, but we could judge the 
fearsome acceleration as the little 
dart was flung low above the water 
at a speed around two hundred and 



fifty miles per hour. For an instant 
we lost it against the trees of the 
dark island opposite, then it slipped 
into view above the strait. There 
was a murmur as those with binoc- 
ulars saw the marker buoy drop 
away as the glider turned to make 
its approach. The distance of this 
buoy from the Fulcrum was taken 
into account in the final placings, 
encouraging pilots to go for speed 
and distance instead of merely 
stalling slowly in for an accurate 
landing. 

Archer was gliding and he had 
squeezed a little too much distance 
from his speed. He was coming in 
fast and low after a wide turn and it 
was apparent he would not make 
the finishing buoy. Skimming the 
sea so close I’ll swear he raised 
ripples on the calm surface, he used 
his last breath of flying speed in a 
shallow climb, then stalled and 
dropped into the water about two 
hundred yards away. The specta- 
tors clapped politely as he struggled 
clear of his harness and trod water 
waiting to be picked up. The Foes 
of Bondage were silent, watching. 
Their wristlets remained neutral to 
a woman — neither showing the 
purple of engaged distaste nor the 
pink of pleasure. I assumed they 
had done their homework and dis- 
covered that Archer had no bonded 
S.P. man. 

I caught sight of Carioca Jones at 
the instant she glanced at me — and 
suddenly I knew that the Foes’ 
rancor was being reserved for our 



66 



GALAXY 




boat and Doug Marshall in par- 
ticular. 

M arshall was gliding, Charles 
was steering and I was obser- 
ving, sitting in the stern and watch- 
ing for trouble, Charles’ attention 
naturally being concentrated on the 
Fulcrum ahead. I stole a quick 
glance over my shoulder and saw 
the black post rising solitary out of 
the flat sea about half a mile ahead. 
I looked back and Marshall was 
waving. 

“Right!” I shouted to Charles. 
He gunned the motor. The Whip 
took the strain and rose dripping 
from the water with hardly a sag in 
its rigid length. A feather of foam 
appeared at Marshall’s skis as he 
began to move, rising upright with 
the glider attached to his back like 
a bright vampire. 

The boat rose on its foils and the 
last of the roiling wake fled 
abruptly astern to be replaced by 
twin hissing threads of spray. 
Marshall began to experience lift 
and kicked off the skis, raising his 
hands to grip the controls in the 
nose of the glider. He drew up his 
legs, jacknifing and thrusting them 
back into the slender fuselage. He 
was flying, the Whip attached to 
his chest harness with a snap-fast- 
ening. He sailed easily behind us at 
about fifty miles per hour, lying 
face down within the belly of the 
tiny dart-shaped glider. I suppres- 
sed a shudder — the takeoff always 
affects me like that, ever since 



Patterson’s mistake last season. 
Patterson had grasped the controls 
clumsily — so we assumed after- 
ward. Anyway, his glider had 
plunged down suddenly, the Whip 
had smashed through the nose, 
jamming. Then the angle of the 
Whip to the glider had taken it 
down through the water, deeper, 
deeper ... I think the most terrify- 
ing thing was watching the Whip 
shortening, shortening despite the 
deceleration of the boat, as the 
glider and Patterson dove uncon- 
trollably into the black pressure of 
the deeps. He must have descended 
over fifty feet in about eight 
seconds. 

A sight not easily forgotten. 

But Marshall was safely aloft and 
veering out toward our starboard 
beam, ready to take advantage of 
the initial effect of the Fulcrum 
post. He had banked and I could 
see him grinning at us, grinning 
with exhilaration, a six-foot man in 
a ten-foot glider. 

At moments like this the oddest 
notions come to the front of one’s 
racing stream of thoughts. Sud- 
denly I was thinking of Thursday 
night on the slipway and of the fact 
that Doug Marshall seemed to be a 
target of the Foes of Bondage, who 
had returned from William Lake 
earlier than expected. 

Charles hit the water brake for 
just the instant necessary to swing 
Doug directly abeam and, at pre- 
cisely the right moment, leaned 
across to the Whip bracket . 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



67 




And slipped the pin easily into its 
housing, locking the Whip at right 
angles to the boat. He eased the 
throttle away and we leaped for- 
ward again, the glider riveted to a 
parallel course eighty yards from 
our port beam and matching our 
speed of about ninety miles per 
hour. I exhaled a gasp of relief 
which was lost in the scream of the 
turbines. Just for a moment the 
thought of sabotage had crossed my 
mind. 

“Coming up!” shouted Charles. 

1 glanced around quickly and 
saw the Fulcrum post racing nearer, 
the giant Hook jutting out black 
and solid toward us. In June of last 
year, I think it was, Bennett had 
misjudged the clearance and run 
into the Hook . 

Charles thumbed a button and 
the Eye slid out from the reinforced 
portside of the hull. The craft listed 
as the huge steel loop extended and 
I made the conventional sign to 
Marshall — the 0 of finger and 
thumb. He dipped in acknowledg- 
ment. 

“Brace yourself!” shouted the 
bonded man. He leaned into the 
padded pillar to the right of the 
wheel. I huddled into the seat, 
cushioning my head in my hands. 

The Hook engaged the Eye. 

I probably screamed a little as 
the G’s hit me — I’m told I usually 
do. The Hook engaged the Eye — 
and snatched the hydrofoil, by now 
traveling at around a hundred and 
twenty miles per hour, into a thirty- 



yard radius turn. 

Around about this time I never 
know what’s happening — I just 
cower there and wait for it to finish. 
I’ve seen it from a distance, of 
course, and it looks quite simple. 
The pilot has taken his glider to a 
station off the starboard of the 
boat, so that when the Hook en- 
gages the Eye, the boat veers 
sharply away. Despite its rigidity, 
the Whip bends. The glider begins 
to accelerate as the centrifugal 
force allied to the incredible 
strength of the Whip takes effect. 

I’ve seen boats circle the Ful- 
crum post on the swiveling Hook so 
fast that the Whip spirals like a 
watchspring, the glider lagging 
behind at First but accelerating, ac- 
celerating until the Whip finally 
snaps straight and flings the glider 
outward at speeds of up to three 
hundred miles per hour. A glider 
ten feet long with a wingspan of 
perhaps seven feet, made of 
stressed permaplast . 

There is a certain margin for 
error. If the observer senses that 
the glider is not in the correct posi- 
tion, that the pilot is not quite 
ready, he can tell the steersman to 
abort at any distance up to forty 
yards from the Fulcrum and the 
boat will veer right, slowing, while 
the pilot detaches the Whip from 
his harness, closes in and, stalling, 
drops into the water alongside. 
This is the textbook procedure, al- 
though I’ve seen teams take a wide, 
wide circle and approach the Hook

again without dropping the glider. 

As the G’s forced my head into 
the backrest of the seat I again 
sensed something was wrong. I 
opened my eyes, saw the dizzy blur 
of water racing past, the gaunt 
blackness of the Fulcrum post 
partly obscuring the view. Then, 
climbing rapidly against the sky, 
the glider. The Whip spiraled back 
from Marshall, beyond my field of 
vision. I could see him fumbling 
one-handed with the release me- 
chanism. 

The glider lagged back, dropped 
out of view as the Whip curled. 
Marshall’s snap fastening had 
jammed. He could not break clear 
of the Whip. Shortly all that coiled 
energy would be spent in smashing 
him into the sea — or whirling him 
and his glider into broken pieces 
vertically overhead . 

O nce, and once only, I saw a 
man make a perfect landing 
on the surface with the Whip still 
attached to his jammed fastening — 
yet that man died, too. Farrel. We 
watched from the shore as the Eye 
hit the Hook and the boat snapped 
into its turn at exceptionally high 
speed — the occasion was the finals 
of the National Distance Cham- 
pionships. The Whip coiled into a 
venomous high-tensile spring which 
reminds the overly imaginative of a 
striking cobra. Farrel had gone into 
his slow climb and was accelerating 
as the boat slowed at the post and 
the Whip began to straighten. 



Farrel’s wife was watching through 
binoculars and I heard her gasp 
suddenly — a sudden gasp that was 
almost a scream. I remember the 
expression on the face of Farrel’s 
bonded man — who was standing 
next to Mrs. Farrel — as he snatched 
the glasses from her and clamped 
them to his eyes. Mrs. Farrel 
turned to me. Her face was twisted 
and she was only able to utter one 
word — but it was probably the only 
word applicable to the situation. 

“Why?” she asked. 

And the boat had slowly 
descended from its hydrofoils and 
was wallowing around the Fulcrum, 
while the Whip spent its venom in 
hurling Farrel into a speed of three 
hundred miles per hour. He had 
stopped trying to fight the release 
mechanism now and was concen- 
trating on his attitude, maintaining 
level flight as the Whip straight- 
ened and began to slow. 

At this point the other spectators 
had realized something was wrong. 
Sometimes a foolhardy pilot will 
delay release until the very last in- 
stant of acceleration, taking 
chances on the control problems 
that arise with a dying Whip. But 
Farrel had gone past even that 
point. There was a slow murmur of 
communal horror. 

There were also a few anticipa- 
tory chuckles from S.P. men stand- 
ing near. Except for Farrel’s man, 
of course — he stood like a statue, 
binoculars jammed against his 
face. 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



69 




The Whip slowed — although we 
couldn’t tell from where we stood, 
the Whip must have been slow- 
ing — but still Farrel retained con- 
trol, retained his horizontal atti- 
tude. He was rapidly losing lift due 
to the draggfng effect of the Whip 
at his chest, but he avoided over- 
correcting and plunging into the 
sea and he avoided the disastrous 
stall that would have started an 
end-over-end spin and a breakup of 
the glider. He was giving a masterly 
exhibition. 

And it was ail pointless, of 
course. There were murmurs of ap- 
preciation from around us and I 
think some people really thought 
Farre! was going to get away with 
it. But they didn’t know sling-glid- 
ing the way the rest of us did. You 
never escape from a jammed 
fastening. 

Farrel was decelerating visibly 
now, edging closer to the water, 
extricating his legs from the slender 
fuselage and dangling them, soles 
upturned, like a swan coming in to 
land. 

An S.P. man chuckled, watching 
the Whip. 

There was a communal sigh as 
Farrel touched the water and his 
speed fell to zero. He flipped the 
nose of the glider up in a last- 
minute stall. I think, even then, he 
felt he could avoid the inevitable if 
he could get the drag of the glider’s 
surface area against the water in 
addition to his own weight. 

He didn’t make it. He was prob- 



ably up to his waist in water when 
the Whip reacted. The deceleration 
had coiled it backward, building up 
a reverse tension which now ex- 
ploded in snatching Farrel from the 
water and dragging him backward, 
end over end in the scattering rem- 
nants of his glider, spinning along 
the surface in a curved, frantic 
plume of spray . 

The Whip waved to and fro a few 
times, gradually losing momentum, 
until at last it lay quiet and twitch- 
ing on the surface and the boat was 
able to cast loose from the Hook 
and pick up Farrel. His neck was 
broken — his back and legs were 
broken. Hardly a bone in his body 
had escaped fracture — hardly an 
organ was not ruptured. 

It might have been possible to do 
something about all that. But 
Farrel was dead, too. 

It had taken just a few seconds. I 
remember the look on the face of 
the bonded man when they brought 
the body ashore. Absolved of all his 
obligations, his past crime, what- 
ever it was, atoned for — released 
from his bond by the death of his 
principal, he was now a free man. 
He turned silently away from the 
drenched and broken thing they 
had laid on the sea wall and he 
walked off, saying nothing. 

T hen Farrel, now Marshall. 

Pressed hard against the latex 
headrest, I watched helplessly as 
the Whip straightened, preparatory 
to coiling in the reverse direction, 



70

while Marshall stayed high in the 
sky, transfixed by the tip. I rolled 
my head against the force that held 
it and saw Charles fighting his way 
clear of the G-post. His eyes were 
wide and dead as they met mine — I 
knew he was going to try something 
desperate, but his motives were 
anybody’s guess. He edged clear of 
the post and centrifugal force 
snatched him instantly from my 
view. 

All this happened so quickly that 
I had every excuse for doing 
nothing — in any case, there was no 
way I could have gotten clear of the 
seat. Then the boat was slowing. 
The landscape ceased its crazy 
spin. The Fulcrum post became a 
solid object of iron and rust and 
rivets. As is the way of boats built 
for speed, ours stopped quickly. I 
stood up, my head reeling. 

Marshall was clear, gliding land- 
ward, trailing the Whip behind 
him, the broken end hanging a 
short distance above the surface. I 
satisfied myself that he was de- 
scending quickly enough to avoid a 
stall — the Whip in total length is no 
aid to a smooth landing — and 
turned my attention to Charles. He 
was floundering in the water some 
twenty feet off the port bow. I 
grabbed the wheel, revved the en- 
gine and slipped it into reverse, 
backed clear of the Hook, retracted 
the Eye and motored toward him. I 
got my hands under his armpits 
and dragged him aboard. He was a 
big man, strong and heavy, but he 



was unable to help himself or me. 

‘‘Where's Doug?” he asked 
faintly. 

“Almost down. He’ll be okay.” I 
glanced at the rig that fastened the 
Whip to the boat. The steel tubing 
was bent — the Whip itself had 
snapped off short where Charles’ 
flying body had smashed into the 
swivel joint. 

It was one of those occasions 
where the last thing you want to do 
is to consider the implications. I 
pillowed Charles’ head on a life- 
jacket and spun the wheel, heading 
for shore. Marshall was traveling 
parallel to the sea wall now, diving 
to maintain speed and at the same 
time lose height before the trailing 
end of the Whip began to drag in 
the water and the abrupt decelera- 
tion began. Gauging the point of 
impact, I drove the boat on at full 
throttle. 

Less than a minute later I was 
pulling Marshall from the water 
and extricating him from his har- 
ness, aided by men from a milling 
cluster of small boats. I pulled in 
against the sea wall and we carried 
Charles to the shore, laying him on 
the grass while someone ran to call 
the ambulopter. 

Almost instantly, it seemed, the 
Foes of Bondage were standing over 
us in force and I shuddered invol- 
untarily because I’ll swear there 
was something akin to predatory 
satisfaction in their eyes as they 
looked at the broken figure of 
Charles, his soaked lifejacket 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP

oozing crimson. But he was alive. 

T wo women were to the fore — 
the president of the Foes, and 
Carioca Jones. Carioca was the first 
to speak. Sho indicated Marshall, 
who was bending over Charles 
lifting a bottle to the injured man’s 
lips. 

“That’s the man I told you 
about, Evadne,” the ex-3-V star 
said in a voice sufficiently loud for 
us all to hear. “He’s the prankster 
who tried to get us all out of the way 
so that we couldn’t spoil his fun. 
Well, you big brave man,” she ad- 
dressed Doug, “how do you feel 
now? Your man saved you — and we 
all know why. And now, look at 
him, poor thing.” 

There was a murmur of agree- 
ment from the Foes and I believe 
someone tried to start up a chant, 
but some remnants of decency 
prevailed. Not to be outdone by 
Carioca, the elderly Evadne said 
her piece. 

“It is a terrible comment on our 
society when a man will, quite de- 
liberately, risk his life to save 
another.” 

Fortunately there was a diversion 
at this juncture. A man stepped 
forward and touched Doug on the 
shoulder. He was carrying the har- 
ness that had been cut away from 
the glider. He indicated the snap 
release. 

“Look, like you said, Doug. 
Someone’s been fooling with this. 
The release pin’s been bent. You 



can see the marks of pliers.” 

The crowd had gathered itself 
without conscious volition into two 
distinct factions around the bleed- 
ing man on the sea wall. To the 
landward side were the Foes of 
Bondage, an unyielding bloc of 
womanhood, upright and militant. 
Along the edge of the embank- 
mend, backs to the sea, were the 
pilots, their crews and supporters, 
who up to now had been quietly on 
the defensive. 

The mechanic’s words changed 
this. Doug left Charles and stood, 
flushing. An angry muttering 
spread through the ranks of the 
pilots. The Foes backed off guiltily. 

“I can assure you all — ” began 
the president, hands fluttering, 
wristlet yellowing. 

Carioca took one glance at her 
fading leader and knew her oppor- 
tunity had come. She stepped 
forward boldly. 

“It’s quite obviously a frameup. 
And clever, too. Done by one of 
your own pilots with the object of 
discrediting the Foes and, inci- 
dentally, getting a competitor out 
of the way. Your treasurer himself 
told me he heard someone prowling 
about the slipway on Thursday 
night.” Her black eyes blazed at 
the elderly man, forcing a nervous 
nodding agreement. “So there you 
are. Only club members are fa- 
miliar with the slipway and the gear 
you use. And only a slave-owner 
would think this way, knowing that 
a bonded man would risk injury 



72 



GALAXY 




himself rather than allow harm to 
come to his master.” 

She bent forward over Charles. 
“You poor man," she said. “And 
you only had a year or so to go.” 
Her voice hardened. "Couldn’t you 
have taken the chance that the 
bastard would kill himself? You’d 
have been free, then.” 

She moved back a little, a thea- 
trical gesture to direct the attention 
to Charles and ensure that we all 
heard his reply — so confident was 
Carioca Jones. Faintly, but growing 
louder, we could hear the hissing 
whine of the ambulopter. The Foes 
of Bondage wore righteous ex- 
pressions as they contemplated 
their prize specimen, their raison 
d'etre, while he lay bleeding on the 
sea wall. 

Charles managed a smile. 

“I’ve been a Freeman since 
Thursday, Miss Jones.” 

I t was fairly typical of Carioca 
Jones to have forgotten the 
factor of Charles’ one-third remis- 
sion in her enthusiasm for the witch 
hunt. The uproar that followed 
Charles’ revelation lasted in various 
ways for several months and was 
discussed whenever sling-gliders 
met that summer. The arguments 
waxed furious but it was all rather 
pointless because, in fact, there 
were not many bonded men in- 
volved in sling-gliding. Many a 
pilot had the same fear as Doug 
Marshall — if he were injured so 
seriously that he needed a trans- 



plant, what would he do? Better by 
far to be able to draw on the 
anonymity of the Ambulatory Or- 
gan Pool, which is not available to 
Freemen with their own bonded 
men. Nobody wants to take a limb 
from a person with whom he may 
be associated for years. 

Charles made a good recovery al- 
though it was feared at first that he 
had suffered irreparable damage to 
both kidneys. Luckily the original 
diagnosis proved false. 

In the strange, sometimes primi- 
tive atmosphere of the Peninsula 
issues are seldom clear-cut, and 
solutions or explanations almost 
never at hand. We never discovered 
just who had sabotaged Doug’s 
equipment. Conversely, the Foes of 
Bondage failed to unmask the per- 
petrators of the Lake William 
hoax. There is a simple, neat pos- 
sibility — but one we consider highly 
improbable. Things just don’t work 
out that way around here. 

Carioca Jones weathered the set- 
back, of course. After the elderly 
Evadne resigned following the 
Charles incident she put her own 
name forward and was duly elected 
president of the Foes of Bondage. 
After a decent interval for things to 
quiet down she began to push her- 
self and the Association forward as 
forcefully as ever. 

People don’t change on the Pen- 
insula. Their fortunes may fluctu- 
ate but their characters are in- 
flexibly formed by the time they 
arrive here. ★ 



THE HOOK, THE EYE AND THE WHIP 



73 




A TYPICAL DAY 



. on a racecourse where the 
prize was — the right to be born! 




I t begins with me pulling away 
all the furniture Father shoved 
against the door the preceding 
night. He does it every night so he 
won’t be able to get out and spill 
important secrets after he has had 
too much to drink. 

Father is a boozehound. And a 
genius. And a tortured soul. That 
description would serve for just 
about any of the nuts who have ever 
given something to the world and 
have received stones in return. The 
world is good at shortchanging. It’s 
ungrateful. Or maybe it’s simply 
confused, like Father. 

We live in a tower. It isn’t ivory 
and it has no ivy growing on it. It’s 
made of rough concrete blocks, is a 
hundred feet high and about 
seventy feet wide. Home. 

Father hates the world. 



Or himself. He loves me. 

After putting the furniture back 
in place, I opened the door and 
looked out. What was to see? 
Nothing. A hallway and the ele- 
vator Father used once in a blue 
moon, when he took the jeep and 
went over the hills into town to 
stock up on food or to replenish his 
booze supply. It was a hick town. I 
suppose father and I were hicks. 

The morning of my typical day 
didn’t last long. I dusted the living 
room. 1 ate corn flakes. I turned 
the gas on under the lab beakers — 
same thing every time I got up. A 
humdrum existence, Father said. 
Maybe so. It was all right with me. 

Lunch? I thought about it, 
looked at the clock. No, it wasn’t 
time for lunch, which meant there 
was something I had forgotten to 



74 



do. Schedules, schedules, what the 
hell did I leave out? 

Oh, yeah, 1 forgot to watch the 
races. Checked the clock. Wrong. 
It wasn’t time for the races. 
Hmmm. Oh, sure, I didn’t wash 
my face and brush my teeth. 

Did that. All finished. The 
phone rang. 

“Hello.’’ 

“Hello. Hello?” 

“Hello.” 

“Is that you. Doctor Dakis?” 
“No, it ain’t.” 

“Doctor? This is the University 
calling. Will you speak louder, 
please? I can’t — ” 

“Every damned day of the week, 
you call. Same time, same place. 
Every damned day we go through 
the same spiel. I’m here, you’re 
there, but there’s simply no com- 
municating between us. I know 
you. Miss Fat Rearend. Father told 
me your name. Miss Fat Rearend, 
will you please kiss my — ” 

“Hello. Doctor Dakis?” 

She finally gave up and hung up. 
“Get the hell off the phone!” 
Father roared from his bedroom. 
“I’m off.” 

He didn’t come out, turned over 
so hard the bed whacked the floor. 
In another minute I heard him 
snoring. 

It started raining. I hung out the 
window in the north side of the 
tower and watched the silver 
needles fall from the sky. God, I 
loved rain. I spat down the tower, 
watched it mingle with the clean 



washing from heaven, saw it disap- 
pear, wished the world would renew 
its acquaintance with Father so his 
misery would go away like my spit. 
I’m eight years old. 

The phone rang. 

“Hello.” 

“Doctor Dakis?” 

"Hi, Miss Fat Rearend. No, we 
ain’t got no eggs for you today. And 
we ain’t got no sperm, neither.” 
“Doctor Dakis?” 

I screamed in her ear and she 
hung up. 

“Get the hell off the phone!" 
Father roared from his bedroom. 
He turned over and went back to 
sleep. 

H e got up at noon and we had 
lunch together. 

“Make me eat it,” he said to me. 
His head dangled over his plate as 
if it had a broken connection. 

I spooned some egg into his 
mouth. He grabbed his cup of 
coffee and gulped. I stuffed toast 
through his teeth. Again he gulped 
coffee. I held a strip of bacon and 
he nibbled that. 

I made him eat two eggs, three 
strips of bacon and two slices of 
toast. After he finished he wiped 
his mouth, belched, looked sick, 
got up and stumbled into the bath- 
room. 

“Get the hell out,” he growled — 
slammed the door in my face 
A bell rang somewhere. I ran to 
the open window, looked down. A 
blue truck was parked in the front 



ATYPICAL DAY

yard and the driver was pounding 
on the door. 

“What you want?” I said. 

He backed away from the door, 
looked up, saw me and waved an 
envelope. 

“Can’t you rfead?” I said. “Put it 
in the basket and I’ll pull it up.” 

He kept waving the envelope. I 
hung on the windowsill and watch- 
ed him grow agitated. Finally he 
saw the basket, threw the envelope 
into it, gave me a severe glare and 
took his truck away. 

The cable was from Germany. 
This time the zoo offered fifty thou- 
sand for the aphrodisiac. 

“Who have you been talking 
to?” I said to Father as he came out 
of the bathroom. “I thought you 
didn’t want anybody to know about 
the aphrodisiac.” 

He kicked a clothes hamper out 
of his way and hunted on a bureau 
top for a comb. He combed his 
hair, his most beautiful feature. It 
was long and white and wavy. His 
skin was almost as white as his 
hair, which was why he made me 
coax him to eat. His health was 
poor. I think if it wasn’t for me he 
would have been dead long ago. 

He combed his hair and smacked 
his lips, rubbed them with a 
trembly hand, looked at me with 
big sorrowful eyes. What he wanted 
was a stiff belt. What he expected 
me to bring him was a beer. What I 
got for him, out of the bureau, was 
a box of chocolate-covered cherries. 
With a shrug he took two and ate 



them, took two more and shoved 
them in his shirt pocket. He ate 
them before he got out the door. I 
had the box ready when he turned 
back. He had half a dozen. 

Fine. When he ate candy he 
didn’t have beer and when he had 
no beer he didn’t follow it up with 
whisky. Today he would do some 
work. Marvelous, that candy. Me, 
too. 

In the beginning. Father had no 
money and figured he would end on 
a farm, but he was too bright and 
went to school nights and even- 
tually he got hooked on genetics. 
Or he hooked it. Everything he did 
was right. He took his Ph.D. and 
taught at the University. After a 
while he stopped teaching and did 
only research. 

Sex wasn’t something people did, 
according to Father. Sex was a phe- 
nomenon, like life. Gender wasn’t 
sex. Sex was mating but not the 
mating of male and female people. 
It was the mating of living or- 
ganisms inside people. Father 
didn’t have a better word for the 
two things that joined to make a 
baby. Or he didn’t want to go to the 
bother of explaining it to me in 
technical terms. “Bugs” was good 
enough. A girl bug and a boy bug 
mated and the whys and wherefores 
were mysteries to nearly everybody 
except my dad. A girl bug was an 
ovum, or an egg, while a boy bug 
was a sperm, or a beak. Beaks 
pierced eggs and the rest was 
downhill coasting. 



76 



GALAXY 




Bugs were too selective to suit 
most geneticists. Why did they 
seem to want to mate only with 
their own species? Anyhow, once a 
beak pierced an egg, the egg either 
died or accommodated the invader. 
This was hazardous joining on the 
microscopic level. Father never 
seemed to rise beyond this level as 
far as his personal life was con- 
cerned. At least, I didn’t think he 
was mating with anyone . How 
did I get on this subject? 

Father became famous when he 
invented the racecourse. We had 
one in the den. Plenty of people had 
them now. 

I t was a daily chore of mine to 
clean the racecourse after lunch. 
I dismantled it, ran a clean wire 
through it and put it back together 
again. It was a transparent tube 
with an incubator in its center and 
two little bubbles on the ends. The 
whole thing was about twenty-four 
inches long. 

As he watched me, Father said, 
“You take an egg — you think she 
has no personality? That little girl 
is complete within herself, eats, 
eliminates, breathes, moves — and 
damned if she doesn’t have a pur- 
pose. That’s to mate — butter and 
bread to her. She loves it. Another 
thing, she kills her lover when she’s 
done with him.” 

I knew all that. He had told me 
many times. I knew the sperm, or 
beak, was suicidal and basically a 
rapist. He was sex-happy, had 



nothing else on his mind. He would 
mate or die — in fact, he would kill 
himself in the attempt rather than 
leave off. Father said the beak 
screamed just before he died. 
Father was working on a miniature 
amplifier to pick up their sounds. 
Anyhow, the beak was stupid, or 
else he didn’t expect to get eaten, 
just wanted what he wanted and to 
hell with the consequences. 

As for the egg, she had poor sen- 
sory equipment and recognized 
only sperm from her own species. 
Father wanted to study this phe- 
nomenon and find out why she 
would have nothing to do with cer- 
tain sperm. He thought maybe it 
was their smell, or something 
simple like that. Often she turned 
down one of her own kind and took 
a total stranger — of course, Father 
had given the stranger a squirt of 
his invention so she would notice 
him. Or smell him. Or whatever it 
was eggs did. It was best to talk 
about them as if they were men and 
women, because, actually, the bugs 
were the only true sexes in the 
world. They were male or female 
and no maybes about it. 

People were dumb. They thought 
they could jump in bed and that 
was all there was to it, but the bugs 
in their bodies were out to get to- 
gether and nothing short of disaster 
or bad breath or body odor or what- 
ever could stop them. The bugs 
didn’t care about population con- 
trol — there was plenty of clean 
space in their worlds. People didn’t 



ATYPICAL DAY 



77 




realize there were life forms in their 
bodies that could destroy the 
planet. 

“I’m a male chauvinist pig,” said 
Father. “I admit it. That’s what 
half the peojple in this world call 
me. What it means is that I’m like 
the bugs inside me. I want what I 
want when I want it. I have no 
consideration. It’s the same with 
women. They’re female chauvinist 
pigs. If they can’t get what they 
want they have a fit. They’re larger 
extensions of the bugs inside them. 
If we all came up from the slime, 
we couldn’t have been very big in 
those wet days. Still, who won the 
climb up the evolutionary ladder? 
Whose environment is polluted, 
who’s killing each other off, who 
hates each other?” Father tapped 
his fingers on the table top. “I keep 
asking myself the same damned 
question — which came first, the 
chicken or the egg?” 

He stopped talking. He stared up 
at the ceiling perplexed, bruised of 
soul. 

I went on cleaning the race- 
course. It was shaped like a female 
reproductive system. A sperm was 
ejected from a depository into one 
of the bubbles at the ends of the 
tube and an egg was ejected into 
the other bubble. Fluid carried 
them to the incubator where they 
were supposed to join. Sometimes 
they didn’t. It depended upon how 
my dad was feeling. If he felt 
crabby or pensive, the sperm got a 
squirt of dad’s invention — the aph- 



rodisiac — and the joining was 
frenzied. If he felt sad or apprehen- 
sive the sperm got no treatment and 
the egg remained aloof and im- 
penetrable. 

Squirting an egg produced no re- 
action. 

Father said the squirting muffled 
the sperm’s undesirable qualities. 
What they were, he didn’t know. 
He suspected the egg exuded a 
killer fluid that destroyed stranger 
sperm. He had better look, smell, 
taste or sound right or she would 
murder him before he did his duty. 

T he rendezvous in the incubator 
in Father’s lab always involved 
an egg and a sperm from different 
species. Once, long before, I asked^ 
him why and he said, “Who wants 
to mate a duo of human bugs? I 
know fellows who do that all the 
time. Nate Farrell likes it. He’s at 
the University. Teaches a couple of 
classes and spends his spare time 
complaining about the liberalized 
abortion laws. He claims the fetus 
is alive at conception. In the base- 
ment of his house he whiles away 
the time by creating human fetuses 
in a racecourse. He dumps them in 
the toilet when he’s done.” 

I watched a tiger and a lion run 
the race to the incubator. Of course 
they were really only bugs, but I 
knew where they had originated. 
Father could work wonders with 
dyes and gels. A little dab of 
colored gel on a sperm made him 
look pretty big, especially since the 



78 



GALAXY 




walls of the tube were made of mag- 
nifying glass. A yellow dot was a 
tiger sperm, a pink ball was a lion 
egg, et cetera. I had memorized 
them all. 

The mating of tiger and lion bugs 
wasn’t at all difficult, so I knew 
Father was feeling sad that day. 
Such a mating could have taken 
place in a zoo between two real 
animals. Racecourse mating be- 
tween tiger and lion bugs occurred 
ninety nine times out of a hundred. 
In a zoo, these animals rarely 
mated and getting a baby from 
them was more rare. 

1 stood beside the table and 
watched the race. The course sat on 
a white table and was about at my 
eye level. The little yellow dot and 
the larger pink ball fell into the 
incubator, spied one another, had a 
tussle. The yellow dot stabbed 
hard, the pink ball squeezed him 
and gave him a thrill and then she 
opened and he fell in with a 
scream, after which she ate him. 
And I could have sworn I heard the 
scream. 

The phone rang a moment later 
and Father stomped out of the lab. 
He never answered the phone, but 
he wouldn’t get rid of it and I knew 
why. When it rang the outside 
world spoke — and Father needed to 
hear that sound. 

I answered it. “Hello.” 

It was the same old thing. They 
couldn’t hear me because of my 
speech impediment and all they 
wanted was to fleece my dad out of 



his formula. The University wanted 
him to come back to his professor- 
ship. Sometimes they offered him 
money for the formula, but not 
often, because they knew of the 
exorbitant offers he had received 
from abroad. 

I thought he couldn’t keep a 
secret, believed he had blabbed to 
someone in town during one of his 
drunken excursions. His explana- 
tion was that they had figured it out 
for themselves. 

“They’re idiots but they aren’t 
morons,” he said. “How can I send 
them a living dog-cat fetus in a box 
unless I know how to make the 
sperm bug acceptable? I tell them 
it was an accident. Sure. Then they 
beg me for more and I send them a 
sparrow-hamster fetus. It never 
ends. They bitch because the 
hybrids can’t reproduce. Finally 
they conclude I’m doing something 
they can’t do. Hell, I’ve always 
done that.” 

Either he wasn’t telling me all of 
the truth or he had simply for- 
gotten. The moochers might have 
guessed he knew how to make 
stranger-sperm acceptable, but it 
wasn’t coincidence when they called 
the formula an aphrodisiac. Dad 
had called it that because it amused 
him to do so. The formula didn’t 
heighten the bugs’ desire to mate. 
That was already at fever pitch. 
Dad must have blabbed, probably 
to the bartender in town, a Univer- 
sity fink planted there to pick up 
information. 



ATYPICAL DAY 



79 




I n the late afternoon Father took 
a nap and I read a book I had 
already read three times. It was 
about a distant-future Earth in 
which most life forms were inte- 
grated. The hero built a time-ma- 
chine and traveled into the past to 
the twenty-first century when man 
was beginning to experiment with 
cross-breeding. The experimental 
subjects had survived mostly 
through the ignorance and errors of 
the experimenters. At first they 
were called freaks. They lived in 
communes and were subjected to 
persecutions. The hero of the book 
was so horrified by the hatred di- 
rected toward him by homo sapiens 
that he fled a few centuries into the 
future. There he found the situa- 
tion less violent but nevertheless 
distressing. The freaks were still a 
minority but their customs and 
habits were threatening the overall 
structure of society. For instance, a 
morse (man-horse) married a mog 
(man-dog) and then they quarreled 
about the cuisine. Or a masnake 
married a mird and they quarreled 
about the sleeping and working 
hours. Within certain species it was 
customary for the male to care for 
the children — when they married 
more conventional strangers the 
loving couples had fights after the 
babies came. In the meantime 
homo sapiens — what was left of 
him — was desperately trying to pre- 
serve his own traditions. At the end 
of the book the hero became dis- 
gusted with humanity and its 



myriad shapes and philosophies. 
He went home to the future, 
smashed his time-machine, sank 
his roots twenty feet into the 
ground, veiled his face with his 
weeping hair so the women would 
leave him alone and then he spent 
the next hundred years brooding. 

I enjoyed reading the book 
again. It helped me to understand 
Father better. He wasn’t like the 
men who made bombs or deadly 
bacteria — he was aware of his 
moral dilemma. Should he give the 
world the aphrodisiac or not? He 
drank because he was double- 
damned and he hated the world be- 
cause it always peered over his 
shoulder. 

I told him about the book while 
we ate supper. 

“Talk!” he said, as he eyed his 
plate with revulsion. “Remember 
how you used to do it when you 
were small? Try to recreate those 
sounds.” 

I gabbed, chattered, ran at the 
mouth. I said there was always a 
hero somewhere, like in the book. 
If a holocaust was observed by a 
single objective eye, that holocaust 
hadn’t occurred in vain. In other 
words, my dad should give up the 
aphrodisiac. The consequences 
would become mundane history. It 
wouldn’t be the same as dumping a 
gallon of botulism in the East 
River. Fallout from a nuclear ex- 
plosion was a compound fracture of 
the moral femur. Like a bomb, the 
aphrodisiac was a potential bone-

breaker, but only because people 
were stiff-necked and unimagina- 
tive. 

“That isn’t the way to talk!” said 
Father. A piece of lettuce dis- 
appeared between his teeth. “You 
know damned well you’re doing it 
all under your breath. Nobody can 
hear you. You have every right to 
talk out loud. Use your larynx and 
your mind and your desire — ” 
Spilling my milk, I said, “I will 
when you break all your bottles.” 

1 understood. He worried about 
things like anti-abortion groups. 
We all had a big wide wonderful 
planet in which to botch things up. 
Another word for world was trial- 
and -error. 

“Don’t cry,” I said. “You’re like 
everybody you loathe. I love you. 
You care.” 

“Come here.” 

I shook my head. 

He ate a boiled potato. “Come 
here.” 

‘‘It isn’t time. We have our 
family relationship after supper — 
while we watch TV, when the tower 
is shut up like a grave and all the 
kibitzers out there have put you out 
of mind until another day.” 



I ater we settled down in front of 
j the TV and he held me in his 
lap. 

“Whisper in my ear,” he said. 
“As loud as you can. Break my ear- 
drum.” 

I watched the cowboys shoot up 



the town. And in the meantime I 
smelled my father. The hair on his 
chest tickled my nose. He stroked 
my legs, my back, my hair, he 
pinched my cheek, pressed his nose 
against mine and we stared into 
each other’s eyes until mine 
crossed. 

He was clever, but he gave me his 
mind when he fathered me, lent me 
too much of his savvy. He stroked 
me to draw me to him, desired for 
us to have a meeting of souls. 

“I won’t say I can’t,” 1 said. “I’ll 
say 1 won’t. Does that make 
sense?” 

“Don’t let them hurt you. You 
can be anything you want.” 

“I don’t want to be anything. I 
just want to be.” 

He took my chin between his big 
hands. “Say, ‘ah.’” 

“Ah.” 

“Not just with your mouth. 
Make the world hear.” 

“Ah.” 

“See my tears? Do you enjoy 
breaking your old dad’s heart?” 

“You’re a souse.” 

“Say something to me out loud. 
Scream at me." 

“You ought to use a little soap 
and water to clean your ears. 
Christ, they’re like caves of dirty 
gold.” 

He squeezed me until my ribs 
crunched. I howled, but sound- 
lessly. 

“One day we’ll leave this god- 
damned tower,” he said. “You 
think about that. We’ll walk down 



ATYPICAL DAY 



81 




the main street of New York City. 
Hand in hand. When they all come 
out and say, ‘Doctor Dakis, you 
and your child are welcome in this 
world,’ that’s the day I’ll hand 
them the aphrodisiac.” 

He believed 1 was suffering. 1 
was. Said I, “On the day you break 
your bottles — that’s the day I’ll 
walk out of here with you. I’ll go on 
TV, if you like. I’ll yell through a 
microphone. Everybody from Guam 
to the Virgin Islands will hear me. 
Except we’ll have to come back 
here to the tower every night. It 
isn’t me who prevents my talking 
out loud. I do it for you. They don’t 
hurt me that much. But you hurt 
me, all the days of my life. I won’t 
talk because you drink. You drink 
because you’re jealous.” 

I laid my head on his shoulder. 

“Don't do that,” he said. 

Couldn’t be helped. Getting 
sleepy. Thumb in mouth. Suck, 
suck, it helped me to fantasize. 
Suck, suck. 

Father tried to hold me back. 
“I’ll snuggle you all night, I’ll keep 
you warm. I’ll comfort you. Stay 
with me.” 

Suck, suck. I dreamed — halfway 
here, halfway in another world. 
One was as bad or as good as the 
other since both were safely remote. 
I soared in luxurious comfort. 
Away in the distance Father called 
to me. I knew why. He was an al- 
most perfect person. His one fault 
was that he was intolerant. 

Someone called, and this time it 



was another. The voice was my 
imagination, or at least I thought it 
was. I never really asked. 

Father held me fast. I yanked 
away. I left him to his bottles that 
waited for him everywhere in the 
tower. Father, I can’t help this 
thing. Maybe we both have a bridge 
to cross. Perhaps someday I’ll stay 
with you at night, you’ll break your 
bottles, we'll go outside again, I’ll 
talk your head off, we’ll grow up to- 
gether. I love you. 

I opened the door at the end of 
the hall and closed it behind me. 
The big room was dark and silent, 
but not totally silent. The snakes in 
their cages watched me, warned me 
not to touch their screens. The 
guinea pigs thought it might be 
morning and whistled for break- 
fast, the dogs whimpered as night- 
mares threatened, the baboon 
cursed me for trailing my hand 
across his bars. 

Stopping beside the last cage, I 
took off my clothes, opened the 
door, quietly slipped inside and 
walked to the cot in the corner. Her 
arms lifted and I fell into them as 
a sinner enters heaven: with ex- 
hausted happiness. Deep into her 
hairy bosom I nestled. We kissed, 
kissed, kissed. She licked my face, 
fumbled over my hairless body for 
nonexistent fleas. Carefully she 
squeezed, lest she destroy me. I lay 
with my cheek against my mother's 
breast, felt her powerful arms 
tighten around me and I let the 
world go to hell while I slept. ★

B efore I review, let me preview. 

Something really exciting and 
important has happened and here’s 
the back story: 

A lot of years ago — it was in the 
’50s — I attended a science fiction 
writers’ conference at Milford, Pa. 
1 remember that Judy Merill was 
there. Fred Pohl, Damon Knight 
and an up-and-comer named Elli- 
son. One evening we were sitting on 
the lawn around a tape recorder (I 
wonder what happened to that 
tape?) pursuing some writers’ tech- 
nicality when 1 looked around that 
circle of faces and interrupted with 
“Hey. How come we're all white?” 
I remember well the startled look 
that appeared on all those white 
faces. I don’t recall the ensuing 
discussion, except that everyone 
was appalled and concerned. 
Science fiction people exhibit all 
spots on the spectrum of political 



conviction, but it is safe to say 
categorically that no group any- 
where cares less about race. (I 
recall an introduction to one of Don 
Ward's anthologies written, I 
think, by Orson Welles, titled: Can 
a Martian Help It If He's Colored 
Green?) And one of the Worldcons, 
in the days before Martin Luther 
King, was moved to an alternate 
city when the first-choice hotel 
turned out to be ‘‘white only.” 
Science fiction people as a class are 
interested in far more sweeping 
concerns than prejudice, which by 
its nature demands a narrow head. 

Nevertheless, attendance at any 
con of any size — or a writing course 
or a science fiction club meeting 
will show a statistically negligible 
quantum of black. There are so few 
black writers in the medium that 
“none” is a close approximation — 
there are no black editors or pub- 



83 



lishers, very few black fans. How 
many black fanpubs there are I 
really don’t know, but I bet you 
could cover their postage by shak- 
ing, not breaking, your piggybank. 

On a speaking trip last year I 
brought a recorder with me and 
corralled every writer I could find — 
or find time for — and sat him down 
for an interview. After a couple of 
lulling questions like Why do you 
write sf— you're good enough to 
write anything ... I threw this 
knobby one at them: How come 
we're all white? The answers I got 
are pretty fascinating and I’ll have 
more to say about them some other 
time. 

Well, the other day Roger El- 
wood called me with yet another 
plea for another story for another 
anthology. I have already gone on 
record to say that I have developed 
mixed feelings about this tireless 
editor’s impact on the field, for 
while he has caused some large 
publishers — and more than a few 
small ones — to publish science fic- 
tion, though they have never done 
so before (which is good for us all), 
he has also produced so many anth- 
ologies in such a short time that he 
threatens to corner the market, 
saturating the buyers’ ability to buy 
and other editors’ ability to sell. 
And I do not want my Silverberg or 
Disch or Carr or Knight or Harri- 
son threatened. Therefore I have, 
of recent months, respectfully de- 
clined his requests — respectfully 
and regretfully, too, because he 



does turn out some good ones. 

In this instance, however, when I 
chattily mentioned this preoccupa- 
tion of mine and mentioned the 
tapes I have, he rose to bait like a 
speckled trout in Wormsville, hung 
up, checked with a publisher and 
called me back. How about an 
anthology of sf stories by and 
about blacks — would I then write 
one? I said probably not — writing 
stories is an arduous and blood- 
letting thing for me and I don’t like 
to make promises I might not keep. 
But I sure as hell would (should I 
say sure as Elwood? Sorry.) write 
an intro and, if I can get the per- 
missions, include transcripts of 
those tapes. One of these, by the 
way, is an interview with a bona 
fide black science fiction fan — and 
it’s the best of the lot. His name is 
Lancelot Braithwaite and he is 
thoughtful, articulate, Trini- 
dadian, and a would-be writer. 
This is my challenge to him and to 
any other black who reads this or 
hears about it to get with it and 
write a story. Not an essay — I’ll 
handle that department. And don’t 
send it to me; I don’t answer my 
mail, any of it — it’s my pathology. 
Send it to Roger Elwood or his pub- 
lisher, in this case Bobbs-Merrill of 
Indianapolis. It'll be a mixed an- 
thology, because there are a few 
previously printed yarns written by 
whites which have just got to be in 
this book. 

And just to remove any taint of 
self-aggrandizement from this pro- 



84 



GALAXY 




ject: I stand to get paid by the word 
for my preface. I will donate my net 
as a prize for the best science fic- 
tion story by a black in the book. 
Roger Elwood and I will between us 
find an impartial judge to make the 
award, to be added to the regular 
payment. I guess it’ll be about a 
year before the book can be in your 
hands, but the deadline will be 
somewhat less than half that. 

W e’ve done rather better with 
another of our minorities — 
minors. Science fiction and science 
fantasy have always had a strong 
and steady market for the young 
reader, though as in the main- 
stream, it frequently is not called 
sf. The new growth, popularity, 
and respectability of the medium 
has its impact in this area too, as 
you can see in any bookstore by 
fanning through the kid shelves. 
Some hardy perennials: all of the 
“Paul French” (Isaac Asimov) 
juveniles and all of Heinlein’s are 
now in paperback and holding their 
own. And Andre Norton. 

I do not know Andre Norton, nor 
do I know anyone who does. If I 
met her and found her deeply em- 
bittered at the science fiction fra- 
ternity I could only agree with her 
feelings. I could be wrong, but as 
far as I know she has never at- 
tended a con and probably has 
never been invited to one. She is 
seldom or never reviewed in the- 
magazines and I don’t know if she 
has ever sold to one or been asked 



to. I can’t remember ever seeing 
her name on a Hugo or Nebula 
nomination, and if she ever appear- 
ed on radio or TV I haven’t heard 
of it. Yet she is astonishingly pro- 
lific and, judging by the number of 
titles to be found in print, her sales 
are probably up there with Hein- 
lein, Asimov and Vonnegut. The 
Bible and a couple of cookbooks 
outsell anything on the best-seller 
lists, year after year — she’s like 
that. I will say in all justice — and 
expressing my own personal taste — 
that I have never read a great Nor- 
ton, but by golly I’ve never read a 
bad one and I wouldn’t hesitate to 
give any of hers to a bright kid who 
is just finding out about science fic- 
tion. For myself, as I said, I must 
declare that I have not been able to 
become a Norton fan. Her protag- 
onists always win, which for me 
substracts suspense; nobody ever 
has acne or goes to the bathroom or 
makes a pass; and more often than 
not the hero is the same at the end 
of the book as he is at the be- 
ginning, having been altered not at 
all by the events of the narrative. 
Which is okay if you're the last 
angry man or Lazarus Long — 
otherwise not. Still, what do you 
want for the appetizer in the read- 
ing diet of a voracious youngster: 
Barefoot in the Head? 

G ood typical Norton is Here 
Abide Monsters (Atheneum, 
215 pp., $5.95), a gateway-to-an- 
other-world story in which a teen- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



85 




aged couple slip through into an 
alien Earth full of extraterrestrial 
invaders and fabulous beasts. Nor- 
ton as editor (with Ernestine Do- 
naldy) gives us Gates of Tomorrow 
(Atheneum, 264 pp., $6.50) with 
the subtitle: “An Introduction to 
Science Fiction” and it would serve 
that function well for a kid or any- 
body. Not one of the stories was 
written expressly for the young, 
which immunizes the book from 
“writing down.” The arrangement 
is ingenious, with one story for each 
of a dozen categories — first con- 
tact, future catastrophe, and the 
like. The writers are good ones at or 
near their best — Frank Belknap 
Long, Ray Bradbury, Fritz Lieber 
and others as fine. 

I n the gee-whiz or pulp-core 
level there’s Perry Rhodan, a 
German series which, I am told, 
has hundreds of thousands of ad- 
dicts overseas, and which is trans- 
lated for local consumption by 
Wendayne Ackerman at the im- 
pressive rate of two a month — from 
Ace, at 75c. You can subscribe to 
the books as if they were maga- 
zines, and each volume contains a 
Perry Rhodan adventure, some 
short stories, a letter column, and a 
communication from the fortunate- 
ly unique head of the editor, 
Forrest J. Ackerman. 

H ugh Walters is a pleasant 
pedant whose approach to 
science fiction is about that of 



middle Gernsback. And don’t 
knock it — they don’t hardly make 
that kind no more. First Contact 
(Thomas Nelson, 174 pp., $5.95) is 
about a first contact between us 
savages and the immensely more 
civilized Other. The technology is 
logically extrapolated and explain- 
ed at length, which tends to make 
the people secondary — still, that’s 
what the man does and he does it 
competently, so that any kid has to 
come out of it knowing more, fac- 
tually, than he did when he went in. 
If he wants to find out more about 
people, he can get that elsewhere. 
In sharp contrast is Trillions, by 
Nicholas Fisk (Pantheon Books, 
158 pp., $4.95) a most unusual 
invasion story, full of people you’ll 
like and developments you didn’t 
expect. The invaders are tiny 
faceted jewel-like things that des- 
cend in clouds, drift like snow, 
seem harmless but . Inventive as 
this is, it’s the people you take away 
with you. I hope to see more by this 
writer. 

E lwood at work: Children of In- 
finity (Franklin Watts Inc., il- 
lustrated by Jacqui Morgan, intro, 
by Lester del Rey, 178 pp., $5.95); 
The Other Side of Tomorrow

Herbert Danska, 207 pp., $3.95) 
and Science Fiction Tales, sub-

$3.95). I have learned of, but not 
seen, a second Rand McNally 
volume for young people on “Mon- 
sters” which I assume is the same 
size, price and appearance (very 
good, that, by the way) as the 
Tales. These are all books of orig- 
inal stories. All of the Random 
House ones are by established 
names; the others are astutely 
packaged mixtures of these and 
new writers. They’re all worth look- 
ing at if you’re buying for a young- 
ster. 

A really wonderful volume is 
Jane Yolen’s Zoo 2000 (Sea- 
bury Press, 220 pp., $6.50.) A 
dozen titles about fantastical 
science-fictiony animals range in 
length from a few hundred words to 
full-sized novellas, by the likes of 
James Thurber and Howard Fast, 
Clarke and Farmer. Equally fine, 
in quite a different way, is Terry 
Carr’s Into the Unknown (Thomas 
Nelson, 192 pp., $6.50). It takes a 
Terry Carr to think of choosing, for 
the 12-and-ups, Ballard and 
Borges. Here also are fine examples 
of Silverberg, Bradbury, Gunn and 
Ellison. Carr has a feel for good 
writing as well as good story, com- 
parable perhaps only to that of 
Damon Knight, and anything he 
does can be bought sight unseen, 
with confidence. 

S peaking of fine examples of 
Robert Silverberg, try Deep 
Space, a juvenile antho (Thomas 



Nelson, 223 pp., $5.95). Silver- 
berg’s thumb-rule here is not so 
much fine writing or even provoca- 
tive content, but that “sense of 
wonder” that science fiction is 
really all about. In a well-balanced 
table of contents are van Vogt’s Far 
Centaurus, one of Harlan Ellison’s 
earlier — or beginning-middle-end- 
ing — stories, one of Damon 
Knight’s highly polished tales — 
and one by the editor which is pure 
zetz. 

Well, there’s a sampling of 
what’s going on over there in the 
children’s corner. Would you rath- 
er be a kid now than back in the 
days of the ragged pulps with the 
hide-from-mom covers? 



N ow here’s something I do sel- 
dom because I don’t feel I do it 
well — clobber somebody. I do not 
enjoy writing whiplash reviews or 
reading them either. It’s too easy to 
be clever. Anyone who has leafed 
through a dictionary of slang knows 
there are more ways to tear down 
than to build up and I do not get 
my jollies by sitting here in safety 
clobbering bad books by bad 
writers. I try not to concern myself 
or you with them. I lend support 
where I feel support is needed and 
might be effective, and am most 
pleased when I can share what de- 
lights me. The only thing that 
makes me foam at the mouth is a 
bad book by a good writer. I guess 
all this springs from a metamystic 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF

conviction I have that one is not the 
possessor of talent, but its custo- 
dian. 

I am sure that in the critical 
literature of the future certain of 
our contemporaries will be regard- 
ed as the pillars and pivots of 
artistic expression, and that among 
these will be J. G. Ballard, Philip 
K. Dick, and Brian Aldiss. When 
Aldiss, whose Barefoot in the Head 
fills me with awe, produces such 
clubfooted whimsy as The Eighty 
Minute Hour (Doubleday, $5.95), I 
feel robbed, not only of the critical 
structure I have built up for him, 
but of the hours and minutes and 
ergs of mental quanta I have freely 
given him — time and effort he has 
earned by past performance and 
which he now has subtracted from 
me, for I shall never have them 
back. I am not objecting to the 
book’s disjointedness, its “special- 
ness" — George Effinger got away 
with that, for example, exquisitely 
in What Entropy Means to Me. 
There are, of course, flashes of bril- 
liance in the writing — you can’t 
keep a good talent down — but the 
whole performance is so personal 
and non-participatory for the read- 
er that it leaves me with the feeling 
that the act was both selfish and 
lonesome. I sit down to some 
writers as to a banquet. I can ap- 
preciate tongue-in-cheek as readily 
as anyone. But I can’t do both 
through a novel-length menu. So 
please, Aldiss — not while I’m eat- 
ing. 



T o end on a happier note: look 
for Joshua, Son of None, by 
Nancy Freedman (Delacorte Press, 
291 pp., $7.95.) Let’s say that on 
November 22, 1963, a young doctor 
was present at a Dallas hospital 
when they brought in a dying 
President, and was able to secure a 
tissue sample, freeze it, clone it 
and, through the agency of a surro- 
gate mother, bring it to term as a 
newborn baby. Now if his environ- 
ment, background, education and 
all the elements of his biography 
can be duplicated or closely ap- 
proximated, so that his personality 
is forged in the same furnaces as 
the original, then he isn’t dead! He 
isn’t dead! 

Nancy Freedman takes this no- 
tion in a practiced and skilful hand 
and drives with it, implacably and 
with cleanliness and force, leaving 
you with the conviction that if this 
could happen it would have to 
happen this way. She writes man’s- 
angle narrative better than most 
men, she has done her research and 
her extrapolation of a near-future 
America with logic and verisimili- 
tude — all in all, a fine and exciting 
drama. 

Next month is housecleaning 
time. My backlog has reached the 
point where I must sidle into my 
office and even then things fall 
down. I’ll review dozens of books in 
one word or one sentence, com- 
mitting enormous injustices — but 
I’ll get them out of here. 'La

F ootsteps whispered behind 
him, muffled by the grass. 

He turned and it shot past him, 
so close to his face that he jerked 
back. It struck the edge of the 
temple’s entrance, rebounded, 
clattering, and" skittered across the 
floor, coming to rest in a crevice 
between stones: a pebble. 

She who had thrown it stood 
several meters up the slope, right 
hand tucked innocently into a 
pocket, left hand still curled around 
more pebbles. She had been swim- 
ming again — droplets of water fell 
from her tangled black hair. 

Scofield, always near her, was 
coming around the hill temple, 
silhouetted against the pale sky. 

“You shouldn’t have moved,’’ 
she said. “I might have hit you.” 
He inclined his head in a mock 
bow. “Thanks, Margaret. I’ll re- 
member that the next time some- 
one throws stones at me.” 

“Do that. Where are the 
others?” 

“Darby’s reworking his notes. 
Wight’s gone for a walk. Mayeux’s 
helping me by developing yester- 
day’s film — ” 

“ — and you’re taking care of 
today’s filming. How industrious.” 
He saw her smile widen, realized 
his was trying to match it for 
sarcasm and turned away. 

“Hello, Schneider.” 

A nod. “Scofield. You two enjoy 
your swim?" 



Margaret’s laughter answered. 
Then: “If you see Wight, tell him 
I’ll be inside — that I want to talk to 
him again about Sumer.” 

When the faint echoes of her 
footsteps were gone, Schneider re- 
turrled the camera to its case, 
looked up at the overhanging roof, 
the details of its construction now 
recorded for experts who would 
never have to leave their offices. 
Not glancing at Scofield, he said, 
“I thought one of the reasons for 
our coming out here was to avoid 
the scholarly atmosphere of the 
ship. Yet between Guevara and 
Wight—” 

“It’s a different thing.” 

“Yeah. Dead myth, instead of a 
review of new information that 
might prove useful. Not exactly — ” 
"I’m going to look for Wight.” 
Schneider sat down on the grass 
and lit a cigarette as he watched the 
other man walking off down the 
valley. Scofield hadn’t been willing 
to listen to criticism of Margaret, 
but then what had Schneider 
expected? 

A half-hour later he was sitting 
L in the aircar, sketching, wish- 
ing the radio worked and he could 
hear a ship voice, when the sound 
of conversation made him look up 
from the paper. 

Wight was barefoot, his feet 
caked with mud and dust, boots 
clutched in one hand. Next to him 
was Scofield, walking slowly but 



90

looking tense and impatient. 

“Schneider,” Wight called, “are 
you going to join us in the temple?” 
“No.” 

“You should. All this is of great 
educational value.” 

“So I’ve heard.” 

“What are you working on?” 
Wight came to lean over the side 
of the aircar, myopic eyes squinting 
as he examined the sketch. 

It was a raw but precise be- 
ginning. Schneider had sketched in 
the wall of the largest temple, next 
to which the aircar rested, and the 
outlines of the other three temples 
in the valley: the outward curving 
walls, the multifaceted domes that 
seemed to float above, barely 
touching. The hill temple wasn’t 
pictured — it was on the other side 
of the large temple and what he 
couldn’t see he wouldn’t add to a 
sketch. 

“Excellent. You’re as careful an 
artist as you are a photographer.” 
A suggestion of mockery ran 
through the comment. Schneider 
ignored it — many of Wight’s re- 
marks were double-edged. 

Scofield called, “Wight, aren’t 
you coming in?” 

He was standing in the temple 
entrance, even his size dwarfed by 
the massive opening. Not a door, it 
was a floor-to-ceiling gap in the 
wall. Nothing as inharmonious as a 
door marred the lines of the 
temples. 

“In a few minutes,” Wight said. 
‘‘Sumer hasn’t been forgotten 



yet — ” Scofield disappeared — “and 
won’t be for a while. Schneider, you 
have true talent for copying the 
physical world.” 

“Thank you.” The words held 
dual meaning again, but why give 
Wight the satisfaction of reacting 
to it? 

He toyed with the edges of the 
notebook. More sketches were 
there, including portraits, but he 
rarely showed the last to their 
subjects. Once he had done so, but 
people never recognized them- 
selves — sometimes they even failed 
to identify others. He didn’t under- 
stand it — he’d compared his work 
to photographs and the likenesses 
were exact. 

“Wight?” 

“Mm?” 

“I was thinking a while ago that 
maybe this isn’t a better way to 
spend time than staying at the ship, 
waiting for the great and glorious 
experts to get here from Earth.” 
Wight’s smile curved into a grin — 
he had as little respect for carefully 
nurtured reputations as anyone. “I 
mean, Margaret’s going over every- 
thing she knows of Earth myth- 
ology—” 

‘‘And everything I know as 
well?” A minor joke — Wight had 
given up the study of dead langu- 
ages and cultures in middle-age for 
exo-archeology. Margaret didn’t 
have the questions needed to 
request even a small fraction of the 
man’s knowledge. 

“Yeah. It’s not exactly the sort of 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



91 




convivial atmosphere this group 
was supposed to generate. I said 
something to Scofield about it, 
hoping he’d talk to Margaret, but 
he didn’t want to listen.” 

Wight seemed amused. “Did you 
expect him to?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe. After all. 
I’m the only reason you’re out here. 
The site had to be photographed.” 

Wight’s smile had vanished. 
“Don’t be an ass, Schneider. We 
didn’t volunteer to come out here 
because we wanted to keep you 
company any more than you came 
because of dedication to your work. 
None of us wanted to sit around the 
ship.” 

Schneider opened his mouth to 
object, but said instead, “Do you 
think they’ve gotten into make- 
work projects yet, back at the 
ship?” 

“I don’t want to think about it. 
How they waste their time is none 
of my business.” 

“But for the grace of God — and 
me — you might be back there with 
them now.” 

“Damn you — ” but Wight was 
chuckling — “and your ego. I’m 
surprised you didn’t ask for only fe- 
male volunteers for a harem.” 

“If it had occurred to me I would 
have.” 

“No. They’d never have let you 
off the ship. But it’s a shame that 
only one woman wanted to come 
out here.” 

“And that she brought her pet 
bodyguard along.” 



“Yes. Well, I have to go in or 
Margaret will send her pet to 
retrieve me. See you later.” 
“Yeah.” 



W ith Wight gone Schneider’s 
restlessness was back. He put 
the sketchbook aside. 

Wight and Scofield would be 
talking now inside the temple, but 
no sound reached out here. The 
corridor wound three times before 
it opened onto a small, square 
room. The sanctum, Margaret had 
decided. 

Across the valley the slanting 
afternoon light set off the facets of 
the temple roofs. Wight had specu- 
lated that once the stone had been 
polished or covered with a lacquer. 
The domes would have glittered 
blindingly. But the truth would re- 
main a speculation — no trace of 
polish was left. Had it existed it 
would have eroded away — how long 
ago? Centuries? Millennia? No 
artifacts remained in the temples or 
around them, no debris — it was as 
though the buildings had been de- 
liberately abandoned, swept clean 
to leave no evidence of their 
builders but the strong curving 
lines of the walls and the low wide 
benches that filled the sanctums. 

No evidence here, but in the town 
the expedition had first discovered 
near the ship ... 

He pushed the nagging thought 
away. It was bad enough to stay 
here with a pretense of useful work, 



92 



GALAXY 




knowing that a large town only par- 
tially destroyed by fire needed to be 
explored, mapped, to have its arti- 
facts typed and classified. It would 
be worse to be one of the hundred- 
plus waiting in the ship, with that 
valuable site only a few kilometers 
away. While back on Earth men 
who had long ago established them- 
selves as authorities in the field 
would be setting up their own ex- 
peditions and arranging the pub- 
licity that would add another layer 
of fame to their reputations . 

He automatically conceded that 
the custom was unfair, but the in- 
justice had long ceased to rankle. 
Only for a few, those whose work 
was a testimony to their ambition, 
would the delay be a torture. But 
those few always spread their 
misery to the rest. 

He stretched and leaned back, 
appreciating the silence. 

f j ello, Darby.” 

rX‘‘Hello.” 

Why had Darby come here? 

Looking down at the lined, 
somber face, Schneider wondered if 
he should have continued sketching 
and ignored the man's arrival. But 
it would be rude now not to attempt 
conversation. 

"Working on your notes?” 

Darby nodded. “I’d like to give 
this expedition some type of order. 
We’ve been here two weeks and 
only you have been working. And 
there’s much to be done. For 



example, we could be measuring 
the temples, the outside walls, the 
sizes of the benches, et cetera. We 
should set up a scale for compari- 
son. Right?” 

“Yeah.” At least Darby now said 
“temple.” 

Darby was a purist — worse, an 
anachronistic purist who should 
have been born on Earth several 
centuries before. Alone in the 
group, he’d insisted on not in- 
ferring the mental templates of 
Earth cultures from alien struc- 
tures. To him the temples were 
buildings of unknown function 
until more evidence was found. But 
now — 

Darby was slipping. 

“What else?” Schneider asked. 

“It’s just an idea now, but I 
think we should consider an exca- 
vation of the tell.” 

“What tell?” 

“Here.” An index finger stabbed 
downward. 

“The hill?” 

“It’s too perfectly round. And 
this is the only temple not on the 
valley floor.” 

Could there be earlier structures 
buried beneath the hill temple? 
Schneider dismissed the possibility. 
Darby’s wishful thinking was con- 
tagious. 

“We weren’t sent out here to 
excavate. We have no tools.” 

“No. We don’t even have equip- 
ment for the most elementary geo- 
physical testing,” Darby com- 
plained. 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



93 




“Obviously we’re not supposed 
to start an excavation,” Schneider 
continued. This line of reasoning 
was redundant, simplistic, child- 
ish — Darby might understand it. 
“When we get back to the ship the 
others will hear your theory about 
the tell and maybe then they’ll give 
you permission to began an exca- 
vation.” 

“They’ll give it to someone else.” 
Schneider didn’t object. That 
hypocrisy was too much for him. 
He mumbled “See you later — ” and 
walked away. 

A month of boredom past, a 
month remaining. Schneider 
left the temple for a walk. The 
night was cool around him. 

Wight was sitting in the aircar, 
dictating notes into a recorder. 
Another popular story of archeolo- 
gists-at-work, intended for Earth- 
bound escapists. Schneider halted 
a few meters away, making no 
sound, waiting for the older man to 
finish. Minutes dragged past — then 
Wight paused for a moment, spoke 
a final sentence and shut off the 
recorder. 

“Is Margaret looking for me 
again?” 

“No.” 

“Then she isn’t holding forth on 
the mysteries of the past.” 

“She has her captive audience 
again. I believe she has an ade- 
quate repertory now. Your as- 
sistance is no longer needed.” 
Wight shrugged. “1 was only a 



dispensable, minor character in her 
little drama anyway.” 

“Doesn’t it bother you?” 

“Why should it? It was becoming 
extremely boring.” 

“Not the mythology. Margaret’s 
obsession with it.” 

“Most people have obsessions. 
Darby’s is excavating; mine, the 
past in general. And Mayeux is an 
addict of escapism. Drugs, sex, 
music, drama — any vehicle of es- 
cape will do. Now there is an 
interesting obsession for you to 
observe. And there’s your obses- 
sion, Schneider. Watching the rest 
of us. Margaret, who wants to be a 
goddess. Scofield, who — ” 

“I know.” 

“ — wants Margaret and has her. 
He also derives a great deal of plea- 
sure from your jealousy. If Mar- 
garet were trying to make you feel 
envy you might have a chance with 
her. But she doesn’t give a damn 
about you.” 

Silence. 

“No comments, Schneider?” 
Stillness. 

“All right. I’m through making 
speeches. Now I have a question. 
What are you doing out here with 
the rest of us and our private ob- 
sessions?” 

“I have as many degrees in 
archeology as any of you, as well as 
being the best photographer — ” 
“Don’t be defensive. I know 
that. So do all the others, here and 
on the ship. Which stopped none of 
them from referring to you as a 



94 



GALAXY 




photographer because, despite the 
degrees, that’s all you are. You 
have no true interest in the past. No 
more than a layman’s interest, any- 
way.” 

“True interest? Mine is a more 
valid interst than yours, Wight. 
When I was studying on Earth I 
had a chance to see the ruins of all 
the grand, dead civilizations you 
love. I was more dissatisfied than 
impressed. It took years before I 
realized that I was unhappy be- 
cause too many archeologists had 
been there before me. I couldn’t see 
the ruins clearly. The buildings 
were distorted by all the layers of 
interpretation and opinion, every- 
thing that I’d heard or read about 
them. Did you ever feel, at one of 
those Earth sites, that a shrine 
should’ve been built to the archeol- 
ogists?” 

A smile was twitching the stub- 
born edges of Wight’s mouth. 
Schneider took a breath and hur- 
ried to conclude: “I wanted to see 
what had not yet been tainted by 
another man’s interpretation. You 
can’t do that on Earth.” 

The smile still fought to surface. 
Wight ended it with a cough, then 
said, “You surprise me. You’re a 
romantic. Tainted ruins. I’ve never 
heard of an archeologist searching 
for innocence, but that seems to be 
the only way to describe you. 
Practically lusting after innocence. 
Except in Margaret’s case, of 
course.” 

“Perhaps, Wight — ” Schneider’s 



voice was steady — ‘‘you should 
consider your own motives. Yours 
and Darby’s and Margaret’s. What 
have you done but bring the myths 
of Earth to another planet? What 
are you trying to do but apply them 
to a society that probably had 
nothing in common with the Su- 
merians, or the Israelites?” 

The shadowy smile again. Wight 
covered it with his hand, fingers 
carefully stroking his mustache. 
“I’ll consider it. Now, Schneider, if 
you’ll excuse me, I have work — ” 

II 

S chneider gave up trying to 
stifle a yawn. With luck, Mar- 
garet wouldn’t notice. Neither 
would Scofield, who had been 
asleep the past hour. And Wight 
was playing back his notes. To 
Schneider, at the opposite end of 
the bench, the sound was a low 
murmur, nearly drowned out by 
Margaret’s voice. 

He looked at the pipe and the 
dwindling supply of hashish 
Mayeux had left. It would be nice 
to take some, just a small amount. 
Mayeux would return in a moment. 
Schneider was searching through 
his pockets for something to wrap 
the hash in when Mayeux burst into 
the sanctum. 

“An aircar!” 

Before the echoes had quit he 
was gone again. 

Scofield had jerked awake at the 
shout — he was a half-step behind 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



95 




Schneider as they left the sanctum, 
scrambling and slipping in the 
darkness. 

Once outside, they saw Mayeux 
standing halfway up the slope to 
the hill temple, head tilted back as 
he watched the silver dart-shape 
glide over the temples, heading 
south, out over the inland sea. 

Mayeux stared down at them, 
bewilderment clear on his face. 

Was there another expedition on 
the planet? Or was the ship 
scouting the temple site? 

Scofield was shaking his head in 
confusion. 

Wight had come out of the 
temple but was ignoring them, his 
gaze fixed on the north side of the 
building, where their own aircar 
should have been. 

"Darby.” 

“What?” Scofield whirled, froze 
when he saw the vacant patch of 
flattened grass. 

“He's crazy,” Margaret said. 
“Why should he take the aircar 
up?” 

“Photography.” 

“Of the sea?” 

Then the high whispering sound 
was back. The aircar slowed, made 
a clumsy turn and dropped to the 
ground within centimeters of the 
temple wall. 

Wight reached it first. He pushed 
Darby away from the controls, 
leaned over and stared at the 
gauges. “The fuel,” he muttered. 

Scofield reached around Wight 
and grabbed Darby by the shoul- 



der. “How long were you up 
there?" 

“I don’t know.” 

“How much fuel is left, Wight?” 
“Not enough to get us back to 
the ship. And the radio’s out.” 
Schneider heard a hissing sound 
and turned to see Margaret stand- 
ing, fists clenched. He could sense 
a lynch-mob attitude growing. 
Worried, he pulled Darby free of 
Scofield’s grasp. His eyes moved 
across the hostile faces, came to 
rest on Wight, who could be rea- 
soned with. 

“We don’t have to worry. If we 
don’t return in three weeks they’ll 
send an aircar out after us.” 

After a moment Wight nodded. 
He went over to Margaret, whis- 
pered to her, then took her arm and 
led her back to the temple. A 
moment later Scofield followed. 

Schneider removed the camera 
from its niche in the bottom of the 
aircar. He fingered the release and 
two film cartridges rolled out onto 
his palm. He might as well destroy 
them. Darby had been flying at too 
high an altitude for the temples to 
be photographed properly and his 
flight had picked up too much of 
the surrounding land. 

“Why, Darby? Did you think 
you were going to replace me as 
photographer?” 

“I had an idea . Schneider, 
will you develop the film for me?” 
“It won’t be worth developing.” 
“Sure it will. The sunlight was at 
the best angle. The camera should 



96 



GALAXY 




have picked up shadow marks as 
well as crop marks. If there once 
were any roads here — or buried 
ruins — they’ll show up on the 
film.” He beamed. ‘‘It should 
make things much easier for the ex- 
perts when they arrive. They’ll 
know where to begin their excava- 
tions.” 

Mayeux’s mouth had dropped 
open as he listened. Now it snapped 
shut. He bent down and ripped a 
clump of grass from the soil. 

‘‘Look, Darby. The roots are 
only a few centimeters long. Even 
ten centimeters of topsoil over a 
paved road would be enough for 
this grass to grow there as thickly as 
anywhere else. So you can’t expect 
crop marks. And shadow marks? 
From up there?” He gestured 
toward the hill temple. “We can 
look out in the morning or after- 
noon and spot any irregularities on 
the valley surface.” 

Darby shook his head. “You’ll 
see — after the film’s developed.” 
“Oh, hell. What’s the use? 
We’re stuck here now until they 
come to get us — and all because 
you expected crop marks.” Mayeux 
began to search his pockets. 

“Inside,” Schneider reminded 
him. 

“Yeah. Do you want to join me, 
Schneider? If we smoke long 
enough this is going to seem trivial, 
maybe even funny.” 

“Sure.” He pocketed the cart- 
ridges and followed Mayeux into 
the temple. 

INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



W ight was standing just inside 
the temple entrance, watch- 
ing the first minutes of a shower. 
Rain fell soundlessly on the roof 
and rolled off in a heavy curtain. 

Schneider walked to stand near 
him and looked out across the 
valley. The rain blurred the three 
smaller temples, obscuring the 
sharply chiseled stone, the facets of 
the domes. He could almost see 
them as mushrooms, gray-white 
against the green, sheltered by the 
hills that rimmed the peninsula, 
coming to a point a quarter of a 
kilometer behind him. 

“I covered the aircar,” Wight 
said. 

Schneider nodded. 

“What’s that you’re holding? 
Are those the lights?” 

Schneider stared down at the 
four hour-glass shaped objects he 
gripped. Their reflecting surfaces 
were opaque. “They’ve been re- 
placed.” 

“Aren’t they working?” Wight 
took one and twisted the control 
that circled the lamp’s waist. He 
winced at the glare. “Why would 
they want to replace them?” 
“Margaret—” this wouldn’t be 
easy — “wanted torches instead of 
artificial light, so Scofield cut some 
branches from that grove at the 
base of the peninsula — ” 

“Oh, God. Schneider, I heard 
them say something about it, but I 
warned them not to. I didn’t think 
they’d be so stupid.” 

He started down the corridor. 

97 




Schneider moved to block his path. 

“You can’t reason with Sco- 
field — and I wouldn’t start a 
fight.” 

“No.” Wight rubbed a hand 
across his forehead, sighed. 
“Torches. Ashes and coals all over 
the floor. The carbon-fourteen 
people will want to run tests and 
we’ll have to explain. We can try to 
clean away the mess, but we’ll 
never get all of it.” 

“Is that what worries you? 
Explaining to the others that we 
were using torches inside a temple 
because Margaret wanted to play at 
being a goddess or a priestess for a 
while?” 

“Doesn’t it worry you at all?” 
“Yes. But I half expected it. Did 
you really think that we could in- 
dulge our fantasies out here, then 
return to the ship and act as if 
nothing unusual had been done?” 
Wight didn’t answer. 

T he next evening it was still rain- 
ing. Schneider sketched the 
blurred hills and temples, his boots 
sinking deep into soggy ground, 
rain beating down steadily. Then a 
breeze from the north bent the cur- 
tain of water inward and he 
retreated to the sanctum. 

He sat on the first bench, near 
Mayeux. Behind him were Scofield 
and Wight. At the back of the 
room, Darby had straddled a bench 
and was examining a foam-lined 
metal camera casing. Schneider 



wondered why he had it — the 
camera was in the aircar. 

Margaret stood before them. She 
spoke without interruption, con- 
firming Schneider’s suspicion that 
she needed no response from her 
audience. She stood motionless. 
Each of the many torches was a 
reflected pinpoint of light in her 
eyes and a larger-than-life shadow 
posed at her back. Torchlight flat- 
tered her. 

She spoke of the Svetasvatara 
Upanishad and it was Kali, not 
Rudra, who turned the Brahma- 
wheel, creating worlds, destroying 
them at the end of time. Her speech 
led them through the labyrinths of 
Crete to confront, not the Mino- 
taur, but Queen Pasiphae-become- 
Medusa . 

Schneider ceased to listen. Her 
conversations with Wight had been 
straight narrations of myth. This 
was a deliberate scrambling, a hy- 
brid whose wrongness lay uneasily 
on his nerves. 

He looked around at the others. 

Wight was listening compla- 
cently. If Margaret's distortions 
bothered him his face did not show 
it. 

Scofield, sprawled across the 
bench, appeared to be fighting 
drowsiness and losing. Eyes half- 
closed, he seemed unaware of any- 
one. Then Schneider noticed that 
every time Margaret spoke of the 
consorts of the ancient goddesses, a 
smile flickered across Scofield’s 
face. 



98 



GALAXY 




Darby was twisting the camera 
casing, trying to wrench it out of 
shape, failing, trying again. Why? 

Mayeux was smoking peacefully. 
As Schneider watched he turned a 
cat-curious face. Then he held out 
the pipe, but Schneider shook his 
head in refusal. Mayeux shrugged 
and returned the pipe to his mouth. 

Schneider still watched: Mayeux 
also was flattered by the torchlight. 
Which was not surprising — he and 
Margaret looked alike, could have 
been brother and sister. Almost 
identical in height and bone struc- 
ture, features similar, both with 
black hair and blue-green eyes. 
Both with skin drawn so tightly 
over the bone that white ridges 
could sometimes be glimpsed 
through the tan. But whereas with 
Margaret that bone structure sug- 
gested a tensile strength, in Mayeux 
it was a fragility. His profile was a 
chiseled perfection haloed by the 
torchlight. 

Schneider looked around. For 
the 'first time he noticed that 
Scofield's eyes were focused on 
Mayeux. 

Margaret had stopped talking. 
She stood with eyes closed, either 
tired and quitting, or planning the 
next part of her monologue. Either 
way, Schneider was grateful for the 
silence. 

And then Mayeux began to sing. 

Margaret’s eyes snapped open 
with the first notes. They fastened 
on Mayeux, but he was oblivious to 
her anger. 



Schneider held his breath. 

Mayeux continued to sing. 

Finally realizing that he wasn’t 
going to stop, Margaret launched 
into her speech again. 

Schneider looked down, fighting 
the first tremors of laughter. When 
he had quelled them he again paid 
attention to what Margaret was 
saying. 

“. and despite their loss of 
authority, there was a partial con- 
conservation of the ancient 
mythos . .” 

He raised an eyebrow in inquiry 
at Wight. 

“Neolithic matriarchies,” Wight 
explained. 

Schneider nodded, let his eyes 
close, willed himself to fall asleep. 
Around him, tenor a cappella notes 
ranged through anger-clipped 
words. 

Ill 

D ark spots that were flaws in the 
stone swarmed antlike up the 
walls, chased by predatory torch- 
light. 

Even Schneider’s hallucinations 
were cliches. 

IJe tried to expel the vision. 
Mayeux’s hand touched his and he 
relinquished the hash pipe, shook 
his head, opened his eyes. The 
spots held steady, but for how 
long? 

The pipe was offered again, 
Mayeux’s hand resting a few 
seconds in Schneider’s, an intimacy 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



99 




that made Schneider nervous. But 
when there was nothing more to ob- 
ject to than a too-long touching of 
hands, he could not act offended. 
He took the pipe and inhaled 
deeply. 

Nothing. 

The hash pipe had perversely 
gone out. 

Mayeux plucked it from his 
hand. Numb, Schneider lay back, 
stretched his legs, contemplated 
the sanctum wall. 

“I’m worried about Margaret,” 
he said and listened to his distant 
voice roaring on long after the 
thought had ended, 

“Yes?” Clouds of smoke formed 
trellises in front of Mayeux’s face. 
Memories, unbidden, brought to 
Schneider the folk song Mayeux 
had sung the week before by torch- 
light, with Scofield staring at him 
and Margaret angry. Schneider’s 
mind played with the notes, ampli- 
fying, echoing, rearranging. In his 
memory a helix of pure sound 
curved upward, glorifying — what? 
No matter — the feeling was all. 

‘‘Why are you worried about 
Margaret?” Mayeux asked. 

“She’s blending into the myth- 
figures she talks about.” Schneider 
frowned, able to concentrate with 
the return of reality. “Lilith, Kali, 
Medusa, Isis, Astarte — she’s por- 
traying a schizoid reincarnation of 
them all, with an emphasis on the 
bloodthirsty element.” 

“Countess Dracula.” Mayeux 
giggled. 



Silence, then footsteps on stone 
and Scofield came toward them. 

“Countess who?” Scofield asked. 

The name sounded familiar to 
Schneider, but the associations 
slipped away as his mind reached 
for them. 

“Vampire,” Mayeux replied. 

Schneider free-associated the 
word, coming up with medieval 
nightmare images. 

"Gothic castles,” Mayeux added. 

Scofield corrected: “Gothic ro- 
mance, not architecture.” 

Schneider nodded and gave up 
trying to connect bats with flying 
butresses. It hadn’t seemed right 
anyway. 

A week before the group was to 
. return to the ship Margaret 
fell to silence, worry and occasional 
whispered comments about The 
Others, of whom she spoke in 
awe . 

A week, and Mayeux no longer 
asked others if they wished to share 
his remaining tiny supply of 
hashish . 

A week, and when Scofield spoke 
to Schneider at all it was with con- 
fidence that the people on the ship 
would come after them prompt- 
ly .. 

A week, and Wight’s views 
exactly opposed Scofield’s . 

A week, and Darby had been 
practically living in the hill temple 
for days . 

Schneider went up to investigate. 
He found a scar in the soil, two

GALAXY 




meters wide, ten meters long, start- 
ing at the temple wall and pointing 
toward the sea. Darby tended that 
wound carefully, the camera casing 
in his hands removing the soil, 
millimeter by millimeter. 

Schneider watched and waited 
for Darby to notice him and ex- 
plain — watched, without expecting 
an explanation — and finally left. 
He wouldn’t tell the other four. 
They would discover the trench 
soon enough. 

44 T ’ve been considering what you 
said about layers of interpreta- 
tion and tainted ruins.” 

It was the last evening before the 
return date. The air was cool and 
misty. Despite the chill Schneider 
preferred being outside to the 
smoky ritual in the sanctum. He 
twisted around, eyes seeking 
Wight. There, against the wall, his 
light clothes blending with the 
stone, his sun-blackened face ob- 
scured by the fog and dusk. 

‘‘What — ” Schneider began, 
stopping as he recalled the conver- 
sation of a month before. “Well?” 
“Well what?” The wraith laugh- 
ed and moved toward him, solidify- 
ing as it neared. 

“You’re not attending the lecture 
this evening?” 

Wight shook his head. “As I was 
saying — I’ve thought about your re- 
marks a great deal. Look at the hill 
temple and tell me what you see.” 
Psychological games now? Sch- 
neider almost laughed, but Wight’s 



voice had been serious, almost 
solemn. He looked. 

The temple had become Ror- 
schach blot. 

Ears sensitized by concentration 
he imagined he could hear both 
Darby busily scraping away at the 
trench and voices from the temple 
behind him. But neither should be 
audible here — all he could really be 
hearing was Wight’s breathing and 
his own. 

He glanced away from the hill. 
Wight’s eyes met his, locked, 
requested an answer. 

“I don’t know what you expected 
me to see. Barring the fact that it 
looks very impressive in this light — 
it’s just a temple. Merely a build- 
ing.” 

“Merely a building.” The words 
were pronounced slowly, as though 
Wight were savoring them, wonder- 
ing at them. “Not even an intima- 
tion of this culture’s sense of what- 
ever deities were worshipped?” 

“I don’t worship the supernatu- 
ral. I prefer not to be deceived by 
mists or mysticism.” He was about 
to congratulate himself on the 
phrase, but Wight’s somber ex- 
pression hadn’t changed, so he con- 
tinued: “I can see things more 
clearly.” 

“You’re blind, Schneider.” And 
in a moment he was gone, swallow- 
ed by the fog as he walked away. 

F our days later loneliness sent 
Schneider up to the hill temple. 
All but he and Darby had with- 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



101 




drawn into fantasy, becoming au- 
tistic strangers who rarely left the 
sanctum. 

He stood at the edge of the 
trench, now a meter deep. Mounds 
of damp clay soil covered the 
uprooted grass and topsoil. Darby 
glanced up once, wiped a hand 
across his forehead, leaving red- 
brown streaks, then returned to 
digging. 

Schneider stood there more than 
a quarter of an hour, occasionally 
leaning down to pick up a clod, 
mold it into a pyramid, crumble it 
again. 

Finally Darby set the mud-en- 
crusted casing aside, leaned against 
the side of the trench, managed a 
weary smile. “Did you ever hear of 
Austen Henry Layard?” he asked. 

“The name sounds familiar.” 

“I’ve always envied,” Darby 
went on, “his discovery of the 
Assyrian city of Nineveh. Those 
nineteenth-century Englishmen — ” 
He shook his head. “That was the 
time for an archeologist to live.” 

Schneider sat down on the grass. 
He would listen. 

T he next morning and afternoon 
passed slowly. Schneider sat in 
the aircar, sketched and saw no 
one. In midafternoon he entered 
the temple. 

Once, twice around and he still 
heard nothing. 

Three times and the blackness 
grayed. 

Mayeux was sitting in the corri- 



dor, unlit hash pipe cradled in his 
left hand. His gaze was fastened on 
it. 

“Hello, Schneider.” 

“Hello, Mayeux. Are the 
others — ” 

Mayeux waved the pipe in the di- 
rection of the sanctum. "In there.” 

Schneider listened for voices 
coming from the sanctum. None. 

Mayeux craned his neck around, 
stared up at Schneider for a mo- 
ment, said, “Margaret’s praying. 
Or meditating. I’m not sure what 
she calls it.” 

Then he turned his attention 
back to the pipe. Relighting it, he 
added: “Praying for guidance, I be- 
lieve. Scofield’s asleep. So’s 
Wight.” 

Schneider stepped over Mayeux’s 
outstretched legs, moved quietly to 
the sanctum entrance. 

Margaret was on her knees, her 
back to him. 

Scofield was asleep, as Mayeux 
had said, but Wight wasn’t. He 
noticed Schneider and smiled. 

Schneider turned and went back 
to Mayeux. 

“Kneeling?” 

Mayeux shrugged. 

“Wight’s awake. And watching.” 

Mayeux glanced at him curious- 
ly. “He finds you interesting,” 
Mayeux remarked. 

“How so?” 

“He told me you don’t — ” 
Mayeux waved the pipe as though 
trying to sketch an answer he 
couldn’t phrase — “recognize what 



102 



GALAXY 




is basic. What is necessary.” 
“What the hell did he mean by 
that?” 

“Ask Wight.” 

“He didn’t tell you?” 

Blank eyes met his. 

Ask Wight? Now? Walk into the 
sanctum and disturb that quiet . 

No. There would be another 
time. 



66 TIGHT.” 

W Hours had dragged the 
afternoon through dusk and into 
night. Schneider had waited in the 
aircar for Wight to leave the 
temple. 

“Yes.” 

“What is it that is basic that I 
don’t recognize?” 

“What was that, Schneider?” 
Wight took his recorder from the 
aircar’s storage compartment. 

Schneider repeated. 

“Who told you I said that?” 

“Mayeux. But that was all he 
told me.” 

“And you want an explana- 
tion — ” 

"Yes.” 

“ — of what I tried to tell you 
before and failed to make you 
understand?” 

“Yes.” 

“Migod, Schneider. I tried to 
communicate something subtle and 
complex in the most elementary 
way possible and you didn’t com- 
prehend. We’re down to the most 
basic words of a language and now 



you want me to take the words 
apart and explain what the letters 
mean.” 

“I’m sure that if anyone could do 
it, Wight, you — ” 

“The sycophant’s costume does 
not fit you.” 

“I'm sorry.” 

“Of course. All right. I’ll go 
through the argument once more. I 
should have realized when you 
looked at the hill temple that you 
weren’t viewing it correctly.” 
“Because I saw it as a building, 
nothing more?” 

“I should have realized that per- 
haps that was the only way you 
could see it. But let’s not bother 
with that now. Since you’re blind, 
you must settle for mere words. To 
you a building is a building, a 
stone, a stone — ” 

“I’m waiting for the explanation, 
whenever you want to start.” 
Wight sighed melodramatically. 
“I am explaining, so listen. To you 
objects are their simple physical 
selves, which makes you ideal as a 
photographer in this situation. But 
if you tried to become a painter, 
say, or even to capture a mood or 
an idea in a photograph, you’d fail. 
You don’t like the so-called layers 
of interpretation, but it’s normal 
for homo sapiens to invest physical 
objects with meaning. Only with 
that extra dimension does the ob- 
ject become fully real. 

“I misjudged you badly when I 
called you a romantic. You suffer 
from a lack of imagination, not an 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



103 




excess. 1 misinterpreted your com- 
ment that the ruins on Earth are 
tainted. Or perhaps you used the 
wrong word. Interpretations to you 
are superfluous.” 

“That’s what I told you.” 
“Damn it, .you’re missing the 
point again. The reaction of each of 
us to these temples is necessary — 
it’s basic — it’s not some frivolous 
and irrelevant fantasy. Since we 
don’t know what this area signified 
to its builders, we have a tabula 
rasa. We construct meanings.” 
“That shouldn’t be necessary.” 
Wight shook his head. “You’ll 
never understand. So please stop 
asking me for explanations. I’m 
beginning to feel responsible for 
your blindness — and I don’t want 
that.” 

at dawn Schneider went up to 
/\.the hill temple. The inland sea 
was a smooth dull gray, a sheet of 
metal laid out from the shore. 

Scraping noises interrupted his 
reverie. Darby was already up, 
digging with one hand while the 
other stifled yawns. 

“Good morning.” 

‘“Morning. I see you like to get 
up early, too.” 

“Not always — just this morn- 
ing.” 

“I think,” Darby said, “that I 
may be able to show you something 
today.” 

“You’ve found some artifacts?” 
“No.” 

“A different type of soil?” 



“Not yet.” 

"Then what?” 

“A feeling, Schneider. A very 
strong feeling.” 

“You’re working on intuition?” 
“It’s been done before. Success- 
fully, too.” 

“Darby — ” Schneider’s exasper- 
ation was almost a physical pain. If 
there had been a find here it 
could have represented a way to 
pull the others out of their fantasy 
worlds. 

He left Darby, who didn’t look 
up. 

M ayeux came out of the 
temple later in the morning. 
Rubbing bloodshot eyes, he fixed a 
cup of coffee. When he’d drained 
it, Schneider asked, “Is Margaret 
still at it?” 

“I suppose so. I heard her 
talking a couple of times during the 
night, though.” 

“What did she say?” 

“I couldn’t tell. She was crying, 
too. I don’t know what she thinks 
she'll accomplish. Pray — and God 
will send a rescue team? Pray — and 
the fuel tank will be refilled? I’ve 
seen other religious zealots who be- 
lieved in miracles, but to cry when 
one doesn’t happen — ” 

“Maybe her knees hurt.” 

“Don’t be such a sonofabitch. 
She’s not bothering you.” Mayeux 
fixed another cup of coffee and 
took it into the temple. 

Schneider leaned against the air- 
car, his fingers drumming on its 



104 



GALAXY 




metal shell. Just as the noise was 
becoming an irritant, he saw 
Mayeux standing in the temple en- 
trance, gesturing to him. 

IV 

**lk/I ARGARET t0 *^ Scofield she 

iYIwants to talk to us,” 
Mayeux said as they hurried along 
the corridor. 

“Told Scofield?" 

“She won’t talk to anyone else 
yet.” 

“What about Darby?” 

“What about him?" 

“Never mind.” 

They were at the entrance of the 
sanctum. Schneider saw Wight 
sitting on the front bench, arms 
folded across his chest. Margaret 
was talking to Scofield, who was 
lighting a new set of torches from 
the stack of branches in the corner. 

Margaret. 

Her face was ashen under a film 
of sweat — her eyes were swollen 
and red. For the first time Sch- 
neider pitied her. She might be in- 
sane and a threat to the sanity of 
the others, but her madness was 
taking its greatest toll of her. 

“Margaret — " 

He reached out a hand but 
before it touched her she turned to 
look directly at him. No. Into him. 
Through him. He fell back under 
that gaze. 

“The Others haven’t yet come for 

us?” 

“No,” he said quietly. 

INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



“I was right, then. They’re 
angry.” 

She went over to Wight and re- 
peated, “I was right.” 

He nodded, smiling, mocking 
her. Schneider expected her to re- 
act with fury. 

Instead, almost wistfully: 
“They’re angry.” 

“Yes, they’re angry.” 

Her eyelids fell. She nodded a 
few times, acknowledging his 
agreement. Then she looked at 
Mayeux. Schneider waited for her 
to repeat the incantation. He might 
have to slap her to free her from the 
delusion. 

Mayeux met her gaze for a mo- 
ment, then reached into a pocket 
for his pipe, filled and lighted it 
and walked to the back of the 
room. He sat down on the last 
bench. 

“Margaret doesn’t like him,” 
Scofield murmured. 

Margaret had turned back to 
them. She was frowning. 

“So what if they’re angry?” 
Schneider said. “They’ll come after 
us anyway.” 

“No.” 

“Yes, Margaret.” 

“They’re angry and they have to 
be appeased.” 

He checked his response. Ap- 
peased? A new element to her mad- 
ness. “How?” 

There was no answer. He stared 
past her at Wight, who had switch- 
ed on the recorder. Schneider pic- 
tured the writer/archeologist using 

105 




all this in some future dissertation, 
article or book. The thought in- 
furiated him. It was time to put an 
end to the little drama. 

“Aren’t your prayers working, 
Margaret? Isn’t your make-believe 
world congenial any more?” 

“Leave her alone,” Scofield said, 
but for the moment he could be ig- 
nored. Margaret’s hands were 
clasped tightly, knuckles showing 
whitely through the skin. 

“Your prayers don’t work, Mar- 
garet.” 

She nodded. There was a 
minute’s silence before she said, 
“The prayers are not enough.” 

“What, then?” 

“A sacrifice." 

“That’s great. That’s perfect, 
Margaret. Wight’s recorded that, 
so when we get back to the ship 
you’ll be put under sedation until 
you can be taken to a hospital.” 

“We won’t get back to the ship 
without a sacrifice.” Her voice was 
patient but stubborn. 

“Is that so?” He stepped closer 
to her and tilted her head back 
until she was staring directly at 
him. “And you don’t even look in- 
sane.” 

Her right hand lashed across his 
face, rough nails scratching. Re- 
flexively, he slapped her. 

“Schneider.” Wight was shaking 
his head. 

Scofield was backing toward the 
corner. 

“That was a mistake,” Wight 
said. 



“Was it?” 

“Yes.” Scofield answered. He 
watched Schneider while he reach- 
ed back toward the stack of 
branches. 

a minute. Wight, you 

VV know I hit her only to snap 
her out of it. Scofield, you realize 
that, don’t you? Help me explain to 
him. Wight. Mayeux — ” 

Mayeux’s eyes were glazed. He 
jerked when he heard his name, 
then settled back against the wall. 
The pipe still in his mouth, he 
began to sing, the words mumbled 
and distorted. 

“Are you out of your mind, too?” 

Schneider’s eyes moved from 
Mayeux to Wight, who hadn’t left 
the bench, then to Scofield, whose 
right hand was curled around a 
heavy branch, which had just meta- 
morphosed into a crude but usable 
club. 

“Wight?” 

“I tried to warn you to conform, 
Schneider, but you never listened. 
Now — ” He shrugged, rubbed his 
hands together, one over the other. 
A moment later, as if answering 
Schneider’s bewilderment, he 
mumbled a few words. Schneider 
caught only one clearly, the rest 
vaguely. 

“Pilot? Why are you talking 
about a pilot now? Help me — talk 
to Scofield, for God’s sake!” 

“Deaf, as well as blind? And in a 
similar way. You hear the sound 
but miss the words.” 



106 



GALAXY 




“You’re al! insane.” Schneider 
took a step backward, another, yet 
another, then turned and ran. He 
could hear Scofield following. 

He burst out of the temple. 

Pilot . 

Of course. The aircar — the rest 
of what Wight had mumbled so in- 
distinctly still made no sense. But 
the aircar did. 

Schneider slowed, sliding across 
the grass, halted and looked back 
at the aircar. Scofield was framed 
by the temple entrance. He was 
much closer to the machine than 
Schneider. 

Warily Schneider started on a 
semicircular path around Scofield. 
He had taken five steps when Sco- 
field left the temple, carelessly 
swinging the club. 

Schneider wheeled to run up the 
hill. 

Near the summit he fell. He 
caught a glimpse of Scofield, 
climbing quickly, clutched at the 
grass and lurched to his feet. The 
hill temple was only a few meters 
before him, then beside him, then 
behind him as he neared the 
trench. 

Darby was there, hands cradling 
a large white stone. 

“Darby — ” 

The excavator looked up and 
smiled. “Look, Schneider — a Jeri- 
cho skull! The first artifact we’ve 
found — and so close to its Earth 
counterpart — ” His fingers ran over 
his find, stroking gently. 

As mad as the rest. 



Schneider slid into the trench. 
Darby, clasping the featureless 
rock, backed away. 

“You have to be careful with 
this,” he said. “It’s a skull. It’s 
fragile.” 

Schneider disregarded him, 
scanning the trench for the camera 
casing. It would serve as a weapon. 
He spotted it at the other end of the 
trench, too far away to reach. 

Footsteps behind him, muffled 
by the grass. 

“Give me the skull.” 

Schneider lunged forward. Then 
darkness caught him, falling at the 
edge of a club. 

T he cold brought him fiack to 
consciousness^ — that, and the 
pressure against the back of his 
neck. He jerked away from it. The 
movement brought pain and he 
moaned. 

“Schneider?” 

The voice was unfamiliar. He 
tried craning his neck to look at the 
speaker, but the agony was too 
great. He waited for it to subside 
before moving again. Meanwhile he 
could see nothing but the cover of 
an aircar’s seat on which he was 
lying face down. 

“Who are you?” he managed to 
ask. The words took an effort — his 
throat was dry and rough and every 
movement of his mouth as he spoke 
caused more pain. 

“Pam Durrell.” The voice sound- 
ed amused by the question. “I’ve 
only met you once, so you might not 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



107 




recognize the name.” 

He did, though he couldn’t 
remember the person to whom the 
name belonged. Risking the hurt 
again, he asked, “My neck — what’s 
wrong?” 

"You have a bruise. Maybe even 
a fracture, though I don’t think so. 
We didn’t bring a doctor when we 
came out here. We had no idea 
you’d be fighting each other.” 
“Fighting?” 

“Wight told us all about the 
rivalry between you and Scofield. 
Someone at the ship should’ve 
guessed that with only one woman 
out here, especially Mar — ” Her 
voice cut off in embarrassment. 
“Wight told you that?” 
“Uh-huh. He was sorry they had 
to tie you up like that, but they 
were afraid you’d try to kill Scofield 
if you weren’t restrained. When we 
got here they had your arms and 
legs bound to a stone bench.” 
Schneider listened with detach- 
ment. His companions had been in- 
genious, letting a bench substitute 
for a sacrificial altar. Given more 
time, they would have found a 
religious use for Scofield’s pocket- 
knife. 

“Can I get up? Will it hurt my 

neck?” 

“1 don’t know — you’ll just have 
to try it. If you’re careful and don’t 
jerk your neck — there. That’s it. 
How do you feel?” 

“No worse than before.” He 
twisted his torso until he could see 
the woman, who was still holding 

108 



the damp cloth she’d pressed 
against his neck. She was young, 
with short brown hair. He remem- 
bered seeing her on the ship, but 
nothing more about her. “You 
people waited long enough before 
coming after us.” 

“We didn’t expect to have to res- 
cue you. In fact, it's going to cut 
into our working time if one of us 
has to fly you back to the ship.” 
“You came out here to work?” 
he asked, but already he was twist- 
ing around, surveying the aircar. It 
was almost twice the size of the air- 
car that had brought him out two 
months earlier and was heavily 
laden with equipment. Even photo- 
graphic equipment, he noted. 
“That’s right.” 

“Where are the others?” 

“You mean your group? Waiting 
near one of the buildings while we 
look for Mayeux.” 

“Everyone else — Darby?” 

“We found him. Digging a 
trench, of all things. Wight said 
you had a lot of trouble with him.” 
“Wight said,” Schneider echoed. 
“Wight must have been very busy 
explaining.” 

She was staring at him curiously. 
“We had to know what was going 
on. The trench, the torches you 
used after Darby went crazy and 
smashed the lights — ” 

So Wight had come up with an 
explanation for everything unusual 
that had occurred. It would be up 
to Schneider to refute Wight’s 
story — Margaret and Scofield 

GALAXY 




would, of course, back Wight. 
Mayeux apparently wanted no part 
of any of this and no one would 
believe Darby. 

H e studied the girl sitting be- 
side him. She wasn’t one of the 
ship’s administrators. If he told his 
story now she might not know how 
to handle the situation. It would be 
better to wait until he got back to 
the ship to explain what had really 
happened. 

Schneider tried twisting around 
to look back at the temples, finally 
stood and turned around in the air- 
car. Scofield, Margaret, Wight and 
Darby were sitting in a silent group 
near the entrance of the largest 
temple. As Schneider watched, 
Wight glanced up, said something 
to the others, then stood and 
walked toward Schneider. 

Wight stopped at the side of the 
aircar and smiled up as though 
none of the morning's events had 
happened. 

“I’m glad you’re not hurt badly,” 
Wight said. “Pam was afraid you 
might have a fracture or a con- 
cussion, but I told her Scofield 
hadn’t hit you that hard.” 

“You told her about everything, 
didn’t you?” Schneider muttered. 

Wight’s smile didn’t change as 
he looked past Schneider at Pam 
and said, “Maybe now that your 
patient is conscious you can finish 
telling me about the findings in the 
town. You see, Schneider, the rest 
of the expedition didn’t stay in the 



ship. They’ve been working the 
past six weeks.” 

Schneider turned to look at the 
woman. The movement caused a 
flash of pain. “Is that true?” 

“Yes. The ship’s administrators 
made the decision. They’ll take re- 
sponsibility for it. We don’t expect 
anyone coming from Earth to 
object too much — they’ll be far too 
busy. All we’ve done so far is set the 
computers to translating and or- 
ganizing the written records we’ve 
found. And we’ve just started on 
them. It should take at least a 
year.” 

“So that’s why you weren’t too 
concerned when we didn’t return 
on schedule,” Schneider said. “You 
were coming anyway. How long 
have you been here?" He’d been 
unconscious for hours — it was 
nearly evening. 

Wight answered for Pam, “The 
aircar arrived just a little while 
after the fight.” 

“Yeah. The fight,” Schneider re- 
peated sarcastically. Wight had to 
be worried about how much of the 
“explanation” Schneider would 
contradict — and when. 

Schneider was in no hurry. 

“What were your findings in the 
town?” Schneider asked. “Did you 
learn anything about these 
temples?” 

Pam laughed. “That’s interest- 
ing, the way all of you refer to these 
buildings as temples.” 

“Aren’t they?” Wight sounded 
genuinely puzzled. 



INFIDEL OF FIVE TEMPLES 



109 




Pam shook her head. “These 
buildings were a form of art. They 
also served some other purposes, all 
mundane — possibly they were in- 
tended to produce given psycholog- 
ical effects. The aliens used their 
architecture to' produce an emo- 
tional response, in the case of these 
structures, awe and fear. We pick- 
ed that up in the written records. 
The corridors force you to walk a 
greater distance than necessary to 
the central room, imparting a sense 
of isolation, of being buried, of 
being severed from one’s world. I 
don’t know how you could have 
spent so much time in there. It 
made me shiver — ” She paused, 
then said, “Actually we believe the 
effect may depend a great deal on 
one’s preconditioning. Anyway, 
we’ll finish here as quickly as pos- 
sible and return to the town. Half 
the buildings there are like these, 
non functional in our terms. Ac- 
cording to the writings we’ve de- 
ciphered, some are supposedly 
erotic in effect. I couldn’t see them 
that way.” She laughed. 

“Schneider didn’t respond to this 
site,” Wight said. 

“Not at all?” 

“No.” Wight spoke before Sch- 
neider had a chance to say any- 
thing. 

Pam stared at Schneider for a 
few seconds. “Well, maybe he’s a 
little too human — and has rejected 
standard conditioning.” 

“This feeling of awe,’’ Wight 
said quickly. “Couldn’t it still have 



some relevance to the aliens’ re- 
ligion?” 

“Trying to salvage your theory?” 
Schneider asked. 

“No. None whatsoever,” Pam 
said. “They were an extremely so- 
phisticated, pragmatic species. 
They had no gods. None. Well, I’ll 
have to find out if Mayeux has been 
located yet.” 

She climbed out of the aircar and 
walked away. 

“That wasn’t just a fight with 
Scofield over Margaret,” Schneider 
said when she was out of earshot. 

“I know. I had to tell them some- 
thing.” 

“And when you tied me to that 
bench, you were planning a sacri- 
fice — " 

“I know what happened, Sch- 
neider. No need to remind me.” 

“I’m going to report everything 
when we get back.” 

“I realize that, Schneider.” 
Wight turned to go back to where 
the others were sitting. “You’ll still 
be all alone.” 

“Wight.” 

“Yes.” Wight stopped but didn’t 
look back at Schneider. 

“No temples here. No gods.” 

“None but ours, Schneider.” 

“None but yours,” Schneider 
said after a moment, but he had 
spoken quietly and Wight was al- 
ready too far away to have heard. 

Schneider sat down, then slid 
until he was lying on his back, star- 
ing up at the darkening sky. His 
head ached. ★

THE DURABLE MAN 

In the most daring experiment 
science ever devised, the group 
invited future — here! 

DAVID PENNY 




The final mutant 

He lay in a hospital bed. The 
sheets, fresh and smooth, stretched 
tightly across his lean body. His eyes 
were closed and his breath whisper- 
ed lightly between his parted lips. 
His head was shaven and attached 
to it were small conducting discs, 
taped to his temples and the supra- 
orbital ridges. Inside was his brain. 

He wasn’t thinking;; — he wasn’t 
anything yet. He failed to exist. He 
lay in a negative state and would 
remain so until his makers, who sat 
in the large room that looked like 
the ground control of some starship 
venture, decided it was time to 
wake him. 

It had taken him a long time to 
come this far. Seventy-seven years. 

Those who had brought him to 
this place hoped the effort would 
prove worthwhile. But none of 
them would know for sure — not 
until someone pressed the switch to 
wake him. 

He was seventeen years old and 
all his life had been unknowing. 
They had taught him, trained him, 
given him knowledge. But he was 
unaware of it, would remain un- 
aware until they woke him for the 
first time. And then he would know 
all. 



Ill 




He lay in the bed, unstirring. 

The air in the room hummed 
slightly. The air-conditioning sys- 
tem was blowing in sterilized air 
from which his lungs filtered oxy- 
gen. 

Inside his head . 

In the control room there could 
be no more excuses, no more delay. 
Someone depressed the switch and 
beneath his dark eyelids his eyes 
rolled in their sockets as he 
dreamed of waking. 



He was running — away — 
the horizon a never-approach- 
ing black line. Looking down, 
beneath his feet he saw the 
solid white line and he plant- 
ed each foot in turn on it. 
Lifting the lagging limbs and 
bringing them forward — mo- 
tion — running — without the 
knowledge of what it was he 
did. Something strange in the 
idea of motion — we all pro- 
gress — only — there was just 
the roadway and the white 
line and he didn't look up be- 
cause ahead was only the 
horizon, still as distant as 
ever. 

And the rain — always there 
was the rain, falling fine in 
misty droplets that soaked 
into his skin and his feet, 
making a shlick-shlick-shlick 
sound against the roadway as 
he ran. The rain: the only 
reality, ever-present . 



A beginning — Year 0: Day 001 

The idea had been postulated 
long before anyone thought of 
attempting to bring it into reality. 
Three brains: each representing a 
point in evolution. Three layers of 
neural tissue, each with its own 
function, each overlapping the 
other, impinging into the other’s 
territory and at times conflicting. 

If only the three separate brains 
could be combined. If only when 
one felt an action was truly right it 
could be carried out, instead of the 
intellect's or the instinct’s breaking 
in and preventing action. If only 
there were an end to the conflict 
inside the head, perhaps then 
conflict would end outside as well. 

Two possibilities existed for the 
realization of the concept: surgical 
and biological. 

Surgery was attempted, but the 
techniques required were too com- 
plex for surgeons to master. That 
left only the biological. Speed up 
the rate of evolution, so that the 
fusion of the disparate functions 
would occur naturally. 

Take a normal man and a 
normal woman and subject them to 
controlled radiation. And corre- 
lated predictables. 

Cut sections from ovaries — take 
samples of semen. 

Let them mature — mix them — 
allow and'encourage growth, stimu- 
late them so that there are finally 
contained in a neutral medium 
many fertilized cells, each with the 
potential for life. 



112 



GALAXY 




Care for them, allow them to 
develop. 

And as they grow — note the dif- 
ferences. In some the radiation has 
had a detrimental effect. In the ma- 
jority — this is only the first genera- 
tion — a high failure rate is to be 
expected. But some have adapted 
beneficially. Search out the embryo 
deformities — and terminate. 

Allow the rest to develop. 

Birth of the first generation. 

Some are blind, others deaf — 
some have no sensory apparatus at 
all. 

Some are deformed in minor 
ways. Club feet. Harelips. 

Terminate failures. 

You are left with a score of in- 
fants, each in its own isolated crib. 
Eight are male and eleven are fe- 
male — of one you are uncertain. 
Discuss that. Is hermaphroditism 
what we want? 

No. But interesting — isolate her- 
maphrodite and study develop- 
ment. 

The survivors number nineteen. 

At tw o years of age only five can 
talk and only four are capable of 
movement. 

The others are failures. Termi- 
nate. 

Two males. Two females. 

At age eight one of the males 
dies. No one knows the reason. 

Terminated by an act of God. 

At age twelve the children, pre- 
viously isolated from all contact 
with each other and the outside 
world — except for that filtered 



through to them by the scientists — 
are brought together. 

A place is prepared for them, 
where there is always a vibration in 
the air from powerful radiation. 

Their skin is slightly darker than 
that of normal children. Their eyes 
are a little brighter. Their minds 
are a little sharper, quicker to 
grasp at unrelated facts and make a 
whole of them. 

They have names, given to them 
by the scientists who in sentimental 
moments have felt some small 
spark of feeling equivalent to pa- 
rental concern. The real parents 
are long dead, killed by radiation 
poisoning. They were volunteers to 
begin with. No loss. 

There are left — two females, one 
male. 

The male is called Joseph (some- 
one had suggested Adam, but that 
was too great a cliche for all of 
them). 

The females are called Mary and 
Janet. 

At age sixteen they are gradually 
weaned from their diet of drugs 
prescribed to prevent early onset of 
sexual interest. 

It would be possible to produce 
offspring directly from these with- 
out need of intercourse, but there is 
some feeling among their makers. 
Allow then? some little life — they 
will have so little time. 



In the room [T9; 192] 

Jo was reading a book, stretched 



THE DURABLE MAN 



113 




out on the sofa, relaxed. Mary 
watched him, a small fluttering 
smile at the corners of her mouth. 
She stared at his absorbed face. 
Then her eyes moved down his 
body. 

“Jan?” Mary turned and looked 
at the other girl. They had talked 
last night in their room, under the 
bedcovers, while Jo slept in his own 
bed in the same room, but unaware 
of their conversations. 

“Mm?” Janet glanced back from 
the window she had been staring 
through all morning, watching the 
distant vista of trees and grass and 
rivers and mountains, seeing all 
from this room. She had been 
wondering if the outside could be 
real. All she knew of was this room, 
their bedroom and the washroom 
where they bathed and excreted 
bodily wastes. 

Mary nodded toward Jo and 
smiled. Janet looked across and 
lifted her thin shoulders. Her small 
breasts trembled slightly in sym- 
pathy with the movement. 

“Might as well. You know what 
to do, don’t you?” 

“I asked Dr. Roberts and he told 
me all about it.” 

“Well, if he said it was okay, 
then — ” Janet was at that time far 
less affected by adolescent long- 
ings. But she had to admit that the 
sight of Jo lounging there had some 
kind of fascination. 

Mary rose to her feet and walked 
to the couch. Jo looked up over the 
cover of his book at the movement 



and smiled distractedly at the girl. 
He took it all as a matter of routine. 
There was nothing in Mary’s ap- 
proaching him that he found either 
unusual or enticing. 

Mary sat on the edge of the 
couch and placed her hand on his 
chest. 

“Yes?” Jo looked up at her 
again. Mary said nothing, but 
moved her hand down to his groin. 
He flinched slightly. She had never 
touched him in that way before ex- 
cept accidentally. 

"Jo — ” Mary said softly. 

Janet watched them, finding an 
excitement building inside her. She 
touched her breasts timidly — her 
own hand suddenly strange — and 
found her nipples had swollen. 

She watched — mesmerized — as 
Mary leaned toward Jo and touched 
his mouth with her own. The action 
seemed so right. 

And where Mary had her hand, 
Jo was growing. The meaning of the 
word man became clear in Janet’s 
mind. Jo muttered something that 
was not words and slowly he and 
Mary slid from the couch to the 
floor. Janet moved across the room 
and kneeled at their side, pressing 
her hand to Jo’s cheek. He looked 
up at her, something not before 
seen in his eyes, and his free hand 
reached up and touched her breast. 
It activated latent systems within 
her body which caused her to relax 
and lie down with the other two, 
touching Jo. Touching Mary touch- 
ing Jo.

Watching on their monitor 
screens the scientists smiled. 

“Pornography is not yet dead,” 
one said and the others grinned in 
response.

PROCEDURE. 

Their life is not yet ended. While 
they sleep plastic-suited technicians 
enter the room and untangle their 
limbs — all are now sleeping in one 
bed. The technicians are unable to 
separate them now that they have 
fully discovered each other, but are 
able to take samples from each of 
the three. These are carried back to 
the laboratories, where they are 
prepared and irradiated and forced 
to fertilization. 

Eggs form. 

The embryos are the beginnings 
of a second generation. 

Some are deformed — terminate. 

Mary, Joseph and Janet continue 
in their enclosed environment. 
When they have to, they eat. They 
are now being fed drugs to increase 
their sexual vigor and the scientists 
concerned with reproduction are 
replaced by those interested in an- 
thropology. It is the first chance 
anyone has ever had to study future 
humans. 

To some the entire procedure 
seemed very unfair — inhuman. 



But we are making them human.

Employment was curtailed. 

Signs of mental retardation can 
now be detected in embryos (in 
eighteen years science has ad- 
vanced and it has become possible 
to tell the sex, partially the intelli- 
gence and possible attitudes of a 
child before it is fully formed.)

“Oh, Jo — yes, Jo — oh, do that

He does it, while Janet watches 
from eyes that are too bright, 
awaiting her turn. Stamina, that's 
what that boy's got, says a man in 
the control room. Who can blame 
him? Wouldn ’t you have with those 
two? asks another and they all 
laugh. 

Five female doctors are on the 
staff, observing. During this phase 
of the experiment two of them be- 
come pregnant. 

Finally, in the incubation vats, 
there are over a hundred tiny em- 
bryos hanging in vitreous fluid who 
have passed all the preliminary 
tests. Some will survive — perhaps 
ten percent. Possibly less.

Only one doctor was present in

the control room. She sat in a weary 
attitude in a chair facing the banks 
of monitor screens — five of them. 
The one directly in front of her 
showed the man lying in the un- 
ruffled bed. To its left were a read- 
out of his jife systems and a trace of 
his brain wave pattern. The jagged 
line of the latter was different from 
any other brain pattern ever re- 
corded. To the right were a static 
display of the subject’s genetic code 
and, below it on the same screen, 
his family tree. A screen beyond 
showed many observers crowding a 
room next to the subject’s, watch- 
ing him through a large sheet of 
one-way glass. 

She hadn’t cared to go down 
there with them. Not knowing why. 
For some reason reluctant. 

She had been here longer than 
any of the others. Now she was ap- 
proaching old age. She would be 
sixty-eight in another week. She did 
not yet feel old — but sometimes 
when she looked at herself and re- 
membered how she had been years 
ago she experienced brief pangs of 
regret at what she had missed. She 
remembered moments of decision 
when she could have made her life 
other than what it now was. 

Not that she hadn’t done her 
homework— 1 -she was no virgin spin- 
ster. She had none of that in her 
past. But she had known times — 
moments of softness that had 
promised permanence of another 
kind. She had passed them by 
because at the time her work had 



seemed more important. 

Now, she wasn’t quite sure her 
decisions had been the right ones. 

Looking down, watching Juan. 

The first one. One. Juan. 

He looked so peaceful. She knew 
she would never be able to tell what 
went on inside that head. That 
superior head, where all three 
brains had been fused into one, so 
that he could feel his instincts, con- 
trol all the previously involuntary 
processes, utilize eighty per cent of 
his brain, instead of her own 
meager thirty per cent, and his 
brain itself half as large again as 
her own. 

“You’re getting old, Frances 
Pryce,” she said to herself. “It’s the 
way it had to be, and you know it 
very well.” She smiled to herself 
and the lines in her face tightened, 
creasing the corners of her eyes.

The ten [38: 075] 

Abraham sat cross-legged on the 
table. The reason for the table was 
that it was the only surface upon 
which he could sit in this position 
and still be able to look out through 
the window. 

There was something compelling 
about the view. He felt the pull of it 



with the edges of his mind, was 
aware of it distantly, but the aware- 
ness lay beyond his control so that 
he could not search out its cause or 
its source beyond simply knowing it 
was there. 

He found fascination, too, in the 
duality of the scene. One view was 
made up of mountains and trees 
and rivers, grass before the build- 
ing. Over the top of that lay 
another scene, where the moun- 
tains were bare and dust storms 
blew across a dark violet sky. 

The duality was one he and the 
others had all lived with and didn’t 
question. It had always been with 
them. It was natural. 

He moved back inside his head 
and grew aware of the links being 
forged there. He could feel his 
heartbeat, always the heartbeat, 
the passage of blood through veins 
and arteries. But that was all. 

So many things were still beyond 
his control. 

He glanced down at his naked 
body, dark and smooth. Then he 
looked up at the window again. 
Something was moving through his 
field of vision. A large flying ani- 
mal, swooping high up on shining 
leathery wings. Present and future 
fused. 

He turned around and looked at 
the others in the room. All were at 
that moment absorbed in their own 
bodies, their own heads. This was 
the time for contemplation. Later 
they would eat and alter that there 
would be the time for sex. 



THE DURABLE MAN 



117 




Abraham realized he was eigh- 
teen years old and felt in some way 
that ought to be remarkable. Some- 
thing was missing in his life. 
Eighteen shouldn't be this way. It 
should be — should . 

But that was part of his inner 
brain — the part* he could not yet 
understand. That was instinct. It 
was there, affecting him, but he 
couldn’t yet unravel its meaning or 
change it. That was for his children 
to do. 

There had been fourteen of 
them. Abraham could remember 
the others who had been with hitji 
when he had been younger. But 
they had been taken away. They 
had acted strangely, screaming in 
the night and in the day their eyes 
had rolled as they fought off imagi- 
nary devils. The doctors had said it 
was a thing called insanity. It was 
bound to happen to some of 
them — the changes were so great 
and rapid. 

The doctors said that what Abra- 
ham and the others were doing was 
very important. The most impor- 
tant thing men had ever done. 

Abraham didn’t care. 

He would have to love with 
Sheela tonight. He didn’t find the 
prospect greatly exciting. He 
thought sex something of a bore, a 
task that had to be carried out be- 
cause the doctors wanted it so. 

But he would rather sit on this 
table and study the dual scenery 
outside. 

He sighed and looked toward 



Sheela. She was pleasant to look at 
and pleasant to touch. Loving was 
perhaps better with her than with 
the others. He and Sheela would 
attain their own individual plea- 
sures and the doctors would be 
satisfied until the next time. 

Beyond the triple layer of glass 
the flying animal returned, its 
mouth opening but no sound 
reaching him. 

The staff [36; 027] 

She stood outside the plain 
wooden door, feeling nervous and 
very young. 

When the buzzer sounded she 
jumped slightly, then admonished 
herself with a brief grin and went 
in. The director was sitting behind 
his desk, the top covered with 
papers and books. He looked up at 
her, his contact lenses catching the 
light from his lamp and making his 
eyes look blank twin globes of 
white. 

“Miss Pryce — so nice to see you, 
please, come in and sit down.” 

She smiled shyly and closed the 
door, went across and sat in the 
chair across from him, pulling her 
skirt down around her legs. She 
wondered if perhaps she should 
have worn something longer. 

“Now then, Miss Pryce, no need 
to be nervous.” 

Does it really show that much? 

“You know that you have already 
been accepted for a post in this es- 
tablishment, but I always like to 
have a few words with new em-

ployees. It can get pretty hectic in 
here at times and I might not get 
the chance to come out for air for 
several weeks at a time. So just that 
I know who you are — and you know 
me — I have these little informal 
chats.” 

She waited, then wondered if he 
expected some form of response. 
Finally she settled for a simple: 
"Yes, sir.” 

“You’re working with — uh, let 
me see — ” he flapped around the 
papers on his desk, not seeming to 
read any of them before he again 
looked up and said, ‘‘Yes, Dr. 
Thomas’s group, isn’t it?” 

“That’s right, sir. On the bio- 
medical monitoring section.” 

‘‘Yes. Rather important work 
that.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“Mm. But then, I suppose all 
work here is important in its own 
way. Even that of the ladies in the 
canteen. We couldn’t do our work 
if we went unfed, could we?” 

“1 suppose not, sir.” 

“Yes.” He hummed gently to 
himself, thinking perhaps of lunch, 
then seemed to pull himself back to 
the present. “You’ve — uh — been 
shown where you’ll stay, have you? 
Not bad little places, really, our 
dormitories. Of course you can see 
the necessity of living on the pre- 
mises, can’t you? Highly secret 
work here. Hm. And you’ve been 
told about — uh, marriage — and 
that kind of stuff?” 

“Yes, sir. If I marry outside the 



group my contract is automatically 
canceled.” 

‘‘Yes, that’s it.” He seemed 
vaguely embarrassed, but didn’t go 
on to explain why. 

The girl nodded. 

“Well, anything else you want to 
know — uh — Frances?” 

She smiled sweetly. 

"No, I don’t think so, sir.” 

“Well. Good luck then. If- ever 
there’s any problem, just see my de- 
puty about it. That’s what we’re 
here for.” 

“Yes. Thank you, sir.” She stood 
up and smiled one final time at him 
and left. The director watched her 
go, his eyes following the tight 
curves inside her skirt and the long 
exposed backs of her legs. 

Then he picked up his pen- and 
began to leaf through the notes on 
his desk again. 

The technology ol change- 
revisited 139:000 ] 

Only four of the ten were found 
to be fertile. It was something no 
one had thought to check on. 

The redundant six were termi- 
nated. 

For a while Abraham wondered 
what had happened to Sheela, but 
it had happened before. They al- 
ways took away the people he liked 
most. Some malevolent God read 
his thoughts and then spirited the 
goodness from his life. 

He slept on, unaware when they 
took the samples of semen from 
him. 



THE DURABLE MAN

Fertilize. 

First stage blastula — progres- 
sion. 

The tiny first intimation of 
humanity lay curled, no longer 
than a centimeter, complete with 
folded arms and legs and large 
blind eyes. 

After selection there were forty 
developing fetuses locked into their 
metal and plastic-weave wombs. 

The bummer [56:100] 

The third generation was a foul- 
up. One hundred per cent snafu. 

Not one of the Third was com- 
pletely normal. Some were almost 
there, but even Jenny, the best of 
the twenty-eight thirds had her left 
leg six inches shorter than the right 
and six fingers to each hand (her 
feet were normal). 

The physical changes were be- 
coming far more noticeable than in 
previous generations. The skin was 
black with a sheen. Hair had begun 
to grow more rapidly and cover 
greater areas of the body (surprise 
was expressed: . didn't think 
evolution would go that way). 
Males were now wearing fine pelts 
of soft hair, covering all but the 
palms of hands, soles of feet, lips, 
and eyelids. The females’ faces 
were free of hair and they had some 
bare patches on the buttocks and 
around their nipples — palms, feet, 
lips were hairless. 

Features had changed also. The 
forehead was becoming more pro- 



nounced. The face was as before, 
but seemed to be compressed into a 
smaller area. Eyes were enlarged; 
nose was slightly reduced; mouth 
was wider, lips were thinner. Teeth 
were much smaller, but no less in 
number. 

In their own way, to the scientist 
who had made them, they were 
quite beautiful, though they seem- 
ed hardly human any more. The 
scientists felt they were watching 
the performance of some species of 
exotic animal, some alien form. 
More than one thought of them as 
monkeys and watching them at sex 
could be embarrassing. 

But they were also frightening 
animals. They were highly intelli- 
gent, but their intelligence was in- 
comprehensible to their makers. 
Previous generations had been 
given lessons and taught about the 
outside world — this one was kept in 
ignorance, taught nothing. The ob- 
servers were afraid of what present 
knowledge might do to them. 

At age ten, nine of the twenty- 
eight were dead of disease of me- 
tabolic breakdown. At fourteen 
their number was reduced to an 
even dozen. Ten females and only 
two males. The males were watched 
over constantly, protected. If they 
should die out now, after all this 
time . 

Sex was introduced. 

A year passed. 

One male died. He was ripped 
apart by five females fighting over 
him. 



120 



GALAXY 




The last male was stronger and 
the females realized he was all they 
had left, so they took him in turns. 
Except when Jenny wanted him. 
Jenny was the leader, her word was 
always law. 

In many ways they were like ani- 
mals, fighting and bickering among 
themselves for simple favors, ar- 
ranging themselves into a heirar- 
chic system of rights and privileges. 
But they reasoned brilliantly — 
without any information to base 
their reason on. 

As infants and untutored, they 
had seemed from the first to be 
aware of that central core of their 
brains where instinct is stored, 
where emotion springs from. Tap- 
ping into it, discovering its uses, 
they deliberately passed through all 
stages of evolution as they grew — a 
process their observers equated 
with a search for knowledge. When 
young they had crawled like rep- 
tiles. As they grew older they lifted 
to hands and knees — at age thir- 
teen they walked and moved as men 
and women with a sure knowledge 
of what they were. 

No one else could understand or 
know them, quite. They were 
visitors from the future, images of 
man in a million years brought 
back in time by harsh scientific 
logic and harsher radiation on their 
cells. 

They had crept through the in- 
stincts in their minds and then 
abandoned them as useless. Now 
they existed on pure but twisted 



logic. But what did they think? 
What did they see? 

A strange, sorry lot. 

Interval 153:276 ] 

Fran Pryce lit a cigarette and 
shook out the match. She placed it 
carefully in the tin top from some 
dried milk can she had salvaged for 
an ashtray on this table. She looked 
across at the man sitting opposite 
and shook her head. 

“I still don’t see why they should 
evolve in this way,” she said. 
“Look — according to all the predic- 
tions we’ve run through the com- 
puters they should gradually 
change to fit into the environment. 
Right? We know that happened all 
along with other life forms, includ- 
ing humans. So why, now, do they 
go against all laws? They should be 
four feet tall, hairless, with no teeth 
and reduction in locomotor func- 
tion. But they’re the opposite. They 
have more hair. The teeth are still 
there and even more efficient if 
anything. So why? Tell me, why the 
hell?” 

The man shook his head, stared 
across at Fran. She was still very at- 
tractive and didn’t look in her late 
forties. If he hadn’t known and had 
been asked to guess he might have 
said she was thirty-four or thirty- 
five. 

“Perhaps our computations are 
based on the wrong premises,” he 
finally said. “What if there is a 
change in the environment in the 



THE DURABLE MAN 



121 




future? How can we take that into 
consideration?” 

“But how do they?” 

“I ran it through the big com- 
puter in the basement. I asked 
what environmental conditions 
would be necessary to produce 
what we’ve gof. I figured we’ve 
tried the other way around 
enough — trying to figure out why 
they should be how they are.” 
“What did it say?” Fran asked. 
“Reduction in atmosphere, 
much of upper layer blown away so 
more radiation coming in. Little 
ozone layer, so high ultraviolet. 
Dessication of planet surface. Lack 
of plant life — therefore they’d have 
to be largely carnivorous — prob- 
ably fishing in what few oceans 
were left. Population would be very 
low, most likely, but then who’d ex- 
pect man in a million years still to 
be around on Earth at all?” 

"They could be adapted to space 
flight,” Fran said. 

“The computer said that, too. 
The same factors fit. Low intake of 
liquids — storage problems. Ex- 
posure to harsh radiation. I’m not 
sure about the teeth, but maybe 
they've invented some equivalent of 
hardtack and need pretty efficient 
choppers to deal with it.” 

Fran smiled slightly. ‘‘We're 
talking as if they were from some 
time up there,” she nodded at the 
ceiling, an abitrary direction. “But 
we made them. How can they tell 
what it might be like a hundred, a 
million years ahead?” 



The man shrugged. 

Fran sighed out a thin streamer 
of smoke. “They can’t, can they? 
It’s impossible.” 

‘‘Why are they like they are 
then?” 

She shook her head. “There has 
to be some reason, we just haven’t 
found it yet.” 

Jenny [59: 167] 

The last remaining male was 
schizophrenic — there was nothing 
anyone could do about it. His body 
chemistry was so altered by evolu- 
tion that nothing they gave him 
helped. 

The man shrugged. 

He sat most of the time in a cor- 
ner, looking up at the bright 
images which he projected from his 
own private skull. 

Two of the females were idiots — 
drooling, only coming alive when 
the male’s fantasies took a sexual 
turn. The others had fairly normal 
intelligence — that is, for them. The 
team of observers translated the re- 
sults of their tests to read some- 
thing like 210 on the standard 
human I.Q. scale. 

Jenny read somewhere over 280. 

She had light yellow eyes and a 
face that even the most unfeeling 
among the observers agreed was 
pretty. 

Her hair was all over blond and 
contrasted with the dark sheen of 
her skin. She was well formed and 
she always had first priority on the 
male. With this generation the chil- 



122 



GALAXY 




dren were not formed artificially, 
but allowed to come naturally. 

Jenny became pregnant. Then, 
as if on signal, two other females 
were gravid. 

Parturition took place thirteen 
months after conception. 

Juan was born. 

Then Dee, and finally Tricia. 

A nicely balanced group, the ob- 
servers thought. 

The third generation died out 
naturally. They had been the 
penultimate leap. Their body 
chemistries, in previous genera- 
tions so tortured and forced, had 
finally revolted and in the process 
severely cut their life spans. Jenny 
was the last to die. She was just 
twenty years old. 

Dawnlight [77:21 8] 

Dreams. Oh the dreams 
that pull at the seams of my 
mind. Tell me what I am! 

Filtering down through the 
grayness is a small spark, 
settling into my mind, float- 
ing down through the layers I 
know so intimately, until 
finally it stops, deep in my 
core, the one place I cannot 
yet reach and I sleep, waiting 
for the light to flood out the 
shadows in this skull. 

“He blinked. I saw it, he blink- 
ed!" The girl swung around and 
hugged the man next to her. The 
roomful of observers tensed. 

From her solitary post Frances 



Pryce watched, her lips held in a 
tight line. This wasn’t right — she 
knew it wasn’t, had known it all 
along but, once committed, she 
had never had the courage to say 
so. She had been here so long now 
that her alternatives had vanished. 

Wake me wake me wake 
me I want to see the light and 
smell and taste the sun. 
Everything is blurred, danc- 
ing on my retinas. But I can 
reach out and soothe the optic 
nerve fibers and the jarring 
stops. Images form. Neural 
highways are opening — I have 
to grow up so quickly, but it’s 
coming — I fee! it all coming 
to me now. 

In my brain. All laid open 
to me now. Like a brightly lit 
plan seen from high above I 
see who I am, what 1 am, how 
I am. I am. I — 

Fran watched his lean body as it 
moved beneath the sheets. Then his 
hand rose to scratch the tip of his 
nose in a gesture so human she 
smiled despite her tenseness. And 
then he sat up, threw back the 
sheet and stood erect. She opened 
her mouth slightly, because it was 
impossible not to be awed. 

He stood almost seven feet tall, 
with skin that seemed to glow with 
dark light through a fine down of 
pale white hair. His face was 
caught up beneath that ponderous 
brow — the eyes clear and deep. 



THE DURABLE MAN

showing no whites, only the irises 
and the pupils dark in their cen- 
ters. He stretched his arms — then 
smiled. 

“Juan — ” she whispered to her- 
self and to the empty control room 
that had suddenly taken on a dere- 
lict air. Seventy years of purpose 
and activity and now she was left 
with just herself, the machines run 
down and their functions ended^ 
except for the almost silent tick of 
the clock above her head. 

Body. Good. That is a 
body. Correlate and index. 
Arms/legs/chest/stomach/ 
genitals/feet/hands/fingers/ 
eyes/ nose/mouth/lips. 

Smile. Feels good. Awake. 

Look in the mirror and see 
myself for the first time. A 
strange experience. Corre- 
late. Not too bad, consider- 
ing. 1 quite like how they’ve 
made me. 

They must think I can’t see 
them. I’ll wave. That’ll sur- 
prise them. Hi there! 

No wave back. Just 
puzzlement. 

hi there! 

Oh, what have I done? 

In the observation room the doc- 
tors and nurses clutched their 
heads as the static burst into their 
brains. From a distance Frances 
Pryce caught the tail end of the 
thought/call and heard it as it was 
meant to be. She stared at her in- 



struments, then at the central con- 
sole showing Juan. 

Someone's there, I can tell. 
What have I done to the 
others? 

She didn’t know how to answer 
and discovered the beginnings of 
fear. 

Juan reached out with his mind, 
curious, and touched the edges of 
the woman’s. There was too much 
noise from those who were nearer — 
all of them were crying out over 
something that pained. 

He felt her thoughts and entered 
them. 

She gasped. It was like . But 
that had been long ago. 

He moved along through the 
• dusty, ancient tracks of man as he 
used to be. Growing to know this 
woman as she had been. Seeing 
through her eyes all of her past, 
feeling through her body all that 
had been. He found joy, pain and 
ecstasy all mixed and intermingled. 
And a terrible confusion. She lived 
in a mind sealed within itself, not 
knowing how to control her body or 
where her thoughts came from— or 
where she was among it all, where 
the feelings of sadness and love and 
weeping came from or went to. 

He felt with her the moments of 
her past. The first time she made 
love. The last time. How her body 
felt now. The times in between. Her 
thoughts, ambitions, secrets, fan- 
tasies. He saw her harbored and 



124 



GALAXY 




secret shames and discovered her 
deep guilt feelings. 

Why did she keep them, harbor 
them, nurse them? Presently he 
saw why. She couldn't rid herself of 
them. Memory for this woman was 
permanent. 

He couldn’t imagine how it was 
possible to live as she did. With all 
that shut up inside her head and 
with her all the time. 

He sorted her mind, cleaned it, 
bundled it up safe and left. 

She opened her eyes as she felt 
the last traces of Juan's presence 
leave her. 

She felt sated, all passions and 
all guilts gone. She felt happy. 

She turned to the screen and 
Juan was gone. She reached out 
and spun the dial and found all the 
rooms empty. 

She stopped suddenly and sat 
back in the chair. Why not? Why 
should they stay here? Surely 
enough has been done to them al- 
ready. We made them, forced them 
into an early growth and how can 
we act surprised that they show no 
gratitude? 

But she could feel no anger or 
pain or loss — or guilt — any more. 

Just a soft, enclosing content- 
ment. 

She closed her eyes slowly, tired 
now that it was finally all over. 

Triad [77; 300] 

They were high on a mountain 
and they could tell there was no 
danger yet of their being found. 



And this was good, for there were 
decisions to be made. 

Juan stood on a spur of rock 
jutting out over the face of a tall 
cliff. Below him stretched the bare, 
tan stone, the sun wavering heat 
from its face. Farther down grew 
scrubby trees — then a rolling forest 
reached down through the foothills, 
beyond which lay the plains. 

He realized distantly the meta- 
physical aspects of his standing 
where he stood. A practical need 
for privacy and freedom had 
brought him here. Now, with the 
whole world beneath him, open to 
his view, a part of his mind drew in- 
formation from the racial memories 
evoked by the scene in his mind. 
These were, he discovered, a con- 
stant reality to him, so that he lived 
as much in the past as he did in the 
present, time flow only a set of 
ascending slopes to him. Before, 
there had been no Juan — but there 
had been image of Juan in the 
future memory of the race. 

But such considerations could 
wait. He had immediacies to de- 
cide — he and Dee and Tricia. 

Aware of the hills and the trees 
and also of the barren dry world of 
the future — and again of his 
million-years-in-the-future self, a 
product of the natural evolution 
that coursed between the stars — he 
focused on the present. 

He looked back over his shoulder 
to where the two women were 
sitting on the bare rock and smiled 
at them. He loved them both, with 



THE DURABLE MAN 



125 




an equal intensity, knowing every 
contour of their bodies and every 
convolution of their thoughts. 

He linked with their two minds 
and the triad became a greater 
whole, able to reach out and touch 
the globe, feeling within its aware- 
ness the flickering candles of intel- 
ligence that were men and women 
and children and the dim slow 
movements of their thoughts. 

They're too old. the part that was 
Tricia communicated to the other 
two. 

Or perhaps we are too young, 
Juan thought. We arrived too early. 
Our time is yet a long way off. 

We were forced to come. They 
made us come, Tricia sent. 

Dee remained silent, the core of 
their binding, holding each to the 
other. Each member of the group 
was playing an individual role and 
together they were greater than the 
sum of the three. 

Tricia, the synthesist, said, They 
made us for their own reasons. 
They were selfish, with no thought 
for us in the matter. They wanted 
to make themselves greater and it 
didn't matter to them how we 
might feel. 

Juan, the questioner, answered. 
They didn't know. They meant 
well. Who are we to blame them? 

Their children. We are their chil- 
dren, Dee sent and the other two 
knew it was right, because Dee was 
their inner core of certainty. 

Was it a premature birth? Juan 
asked. Did we come too early? 



Too early for what? Too early for 
them? Or for us? 

Tricia — we and they are the 
same. They are us— we are they. 
But the separation makes matters 
difficult. We belong to a time a 
million years ahead, but not to 
their time. It can 't be this way. 

So? Tricia asked. 

She and Juan waited, because 
they could feel the answer Dee 
held. Dee was their soul, Dee their 
center, the decider. She knew and 
she would tell them. 

Well? Juan asked gently. 

We are the future, Dee sent. 
They are the past. We cannot join 
with our own kind, but we can 
bring the future back to this time. 
It's the only way it can be. 

So . Juan left the thought 
open. 

No other way, Dee sent. 

Tricia? 

Yes. Dee is right. They brought 
us here — now. We must bring our- 
selves here, too, without them. 

Juan turned away from the cliff 
and walked to the two women, sat 
down with them. He reached out 
and touched each of their faces 
with his fingertips and they smiled 
at him. 

The thought came simultane- 
ously in each of their minds.

THE BABY 

The baby was beautiful and 
brilliant — and hungry 
enough to kill! 



LARRY EISENBERG 





he baby gurgled. 

He was round and amiable, 
with plump pink cheeks that 
glowed like twin rosebuds. He was 
only three months old but he utter- 
ed soft pleasant sounds, waved his 
arms and even kicked out occasion- 
ally. 

Dull gray electrodes were taped 
at the corners of his eyes. A tiny 
microphone rested inside an inflat- 
able cuff wrapped around one of 
his fat arms. Two more electrodes 
nestled snugly against his chest — 
others were not in clear view. 

Dr. Corgan typed a couple of 
short coded instructions that set his 
computer into action. It was a com- 
pact system situated at one corner 
of the large sunlit room. There were 
two tape decks, a control console, a 
line printer, card reader and the 
typewriter. 

Dr. Corgan walked back to the 
center of the room and looked 
fondly at the baby. 

“Lower the barbells.” he said 
loudly. 

He was aware of the artificial 
quality that always crept into his 
voice when he was giving the baby 
instructions but he couldn’t help it. 
High above, suspended from the 
ceiling by an intricate complex of 
pulleys, a brightly colored set of 
barbells swayed gently. He looked 
at the baby and then once again at 
the barbells. He waited patiently 
and then, as though by magic, they 
began to descend until they passed 
just by his eyes. The barbells were 



massive but lovely, with hand- 
painted figures done by a dear 
friend, a fine oil painter. 

Dr. Corgan leaned forward once 
again. 

“Open the laboratory door,” he 
said. 

He waited expectantly until the 
door opened, then sighed with 
pleasure. A warmed bottle of milk 
shifted down and forward into the 
baby’s open mouth and he began to 
suck vigorously. His arms and legs 
churned contentedly. Dr. Corgan 
nodded and left the room. In a 
cubicle behind the east wall of the 
laboratory was a two-way mirror, 
through which he could observe 
what the baby did without being 
seen in turn. On occasion he gave 
instructions from a microphone 
placed behind the mirror and then 
studied the baby’s response before 
returning to the lab to type new 
coded instructions for the com- 
puter. 

Nurse Thompson sat there knit- 
ting, smartly set gray curls peeping 
out of the sides of her starched 
white cap. Dr. Corgan didn’t like 
Nurse Thompson. She had no 
feeling for what he was attempting 
to do and was forever calling his at- 
tention to the length of time the 
baby had been in the laboratory. 
He looked at his watch and grim- 
aced. 

“Mrs. Thompson," he said with 
an edge of malice in his voice. “I 
think it’s time to return the baby to 
the nursery.” 




128

He enjoyed the slow flush of em- 
barrassment that spread over her 
rouged cheeks at the realization of 
her dereliction of duty. She put 
down her knitting and went inside 
to remove the electrodes from the 
baby. When she came out, carrying 
it, the baby was wrapped in a warm 
yellow blanket, the pink nose the 
only feature showing out of the 
wool. 

“Good night,” said Dr. Corgan. 

after Mrs. Thompson had taken 
the infant back to the found- 
ling home Dr. Corgan trudged 
down the hall to his office. A short 
bald man sat waiting for him. The 
visitor seemed amiable enough, al- 
though there was a hint of aggres- 
sion in his probing look. Dr. Cor- 
gan hesitated before offering his 
hand. 

“You are Mr. Tanner?” 

“Of the Medical Times," was the 
reply. 

Dr. Corgan shuffled some papers 
on his desk. He had dreaded this 
interview and yet he welcomed it. 
Publicity was a vital part of re- 
search, but it had to be carefully 
controlled. 

“Let me start from the begin- 
ning,” he said. 

Tanner smiled. 

‘‘I appreciate that,” he said. 
“Some researchers give me a tan- 
gled web of ideas that are impos- 
sible to understand. I like to start 
from the beginning.” 

His pencil was poised over a lined 



yellow pad. Dr. Corgan’s fingers 
trembled slightly. He sighed and 
began. 

‘‘There have been extensive 
studies of learning in children. The 
starting age for reading has been 
lowered to two years by means of 
programed reading machines. But 
two is hardly the lowest possible 
limit.” 

“What has happened to child- 
hood?” asked Tanner, lifting his 
pencil. 

Dr. Corgan was startled. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I didn’t mean to interrupt you,” 
said Tanner. “But if kids are busy 
learning to read at two — when will 
they have time for bikes and mud- 
pies? What’s the rush? Why can’t

they learn at six or seven?” 

Dr. Corgan sat on his anger. 
“That’s a fair question,” he said. 
“The answer is — because they can 
learn at an earlier age. Don’t you 
see? This means that an entire in- 
tellectual horizon is opened to 
them, including communication 
with their parents on a higher 
plane. Children play with mud only 
because they have nothing better to 
do.” 

“I see,” said Tanner. 

“But to get back to the thread of 
my thought. There have been many 
studies with infants at Harvard, 
Princeton and elsewhere. But all of 
these studies have focused on how 
infants develop and learn.” 

“So I understand,” said Tanner. 
Dr. Corgan smiled gently. 

‘‘I’ve gone far beyond those 
studies,” he said. “I've begun to 
teach infants to carry out very com- 
plex, sophisticated tasks.” 

“But how? They can’t speak and 
they certainly can’t move their 
limbs in a controlled way.” 

‘‘All true,” said Dr. Corgan. 
‘‘Nevertheless they have brain 
waves, blood pressure levels, elec- 
trocardiograms, sweat gland reac- 
tions and a host of other physiologi- 
cal parameters at their disposal.” 
‘‘But surely,” said Tanner, 
“these are beyond their conscious 
control? Blood pressure levels and 
heart rate are both controlled by 
the autonomic nervous system, not 
consciously.” 

Dr. Corgan waved his hands. 



“All the so-called autonomic fac- 
tors are readily controllable by the 
conscious mind. I’ve already proved 
that point with laboratory rats and 
human adult patients. Do you re- 
call the woman who learned to 
lower her diastolic blood pressure 
by twenty-five millimeters of mer- 
cury?” 

“I read about her,” said Tanner. 
“But not everyone agreed with your 
explanation of how it came about.” 

Dr. Corgan shrugged. 

“The point is that it did work! 
And the same technique works even 
better with infants. These babies 
are free of all the complicated 
clutter of growing up and the inter- 
action with their family and out- 
siders. By the use of a judicious 
combination of rewards and pun- 
ishments, the infant can be taught 
to do anything.” 

“Anything?” 

“The statement is not as rash as 
you might think. For example, rais- 
ing or lowering one’s blood pres- 
sure is not always an end in itself. It 
offers control over two possible 
eventualities. Add to that the 
option of raising or lowering the 
rate of heartbeat and you now have 
four possible independent combi- 
nations. Suppose now that we use 
ten physiological variables, each 
measurable and each with two di- 
rections to go. We end up with over 
one thousand possible combina- 
tions! Can you conceive of how 
many things an infant can accom- 
plish with over one thousand pat- 



130

terns of responses available to 
him?” 

“I’m skeptical,” said Tanner, 
“but I’m always willing to believe 
my eyes. May I see a demonstra- 
tion?” 

“Why not?” said Dr. Corgan. 
“There are sleeping facilities avail- 
able here but usually the baby is re- 
turned to t<he foundling nursery for 
the night. But if you will come back 
tomorrow afternoon I’ll be happy to 
show you some of the things he can 
do.” 

“Would two o’clock do?” 

“Fine,” said Dr. Corgan. 

T ianner was prompt the follow- 
ing afternoon, but Dr. Corgan 
was in bad temper. 

“I’ve had some problems today,” 
he said. “But we’ll go on with the 
demonstration anyway.” 

‘‘I could come back another 
time.” 

“Nonsense,” said Dr. Corgan. 
He rose and led Tanner to the 
observation room adjoining his 
laboratory. 

“Look in there,” he said. “The 
baby has just carried out an as- 
signed task and the bottle of milk 
was lowered into his mouth as a 
reward. In order to get it, he had to 
hit the correct direction of change 
unerringly in ten physiological 
parameters which are being moni- 
tored off electrodes. These signals 
are fed into the computer which 
will accept only the proper combi- 
nation. It then returns a control 



signal, which places the bottle in 
the baby’s mouth.” 

“That’s incredible,” said Tan- 
ner. ‘‘I could believe that the 
youngster controls one of the para- 
meters. But ten simultaneously?” 
“That’s my contribution,” said 
Dr. Corgan. “Watch the baby. 
Notice that he can do several 
things. He can raise and lower 
those pretty barbells up there, open 
and close the laboratory door, turn 
the lights on and off, and a host of 
other little tasks.” 

“But how does one explain how 
he learns to do all this?” 

“Nobody knows as yet,” said Dr. 
Corgan. “But I think that it in- 
volves the untold neural networks 
available to the conscious and un- 
conscious parts of the nervous sys- 
tem. These networks are as yet un- 
discovered, uncharted and func- 
tionally a complete mystery. But 
demonstrably we can achieve a 
linkup through these networks if we 
really want to.” 

“Have human beings always had 
this capability?” 

“I think so. Perhaps it was need- 
ed during the early years of man- 
kind’s primitive existence.” 

The baby began to cry. His voice 
became strident and his face began 
to purple with frustration. His arms 
and legs flailed wildly. 

“Damn!” cried Dr. Corgan. 
“That blasted nipple must be leak- 
ing again and he’s run out of milk. 
Ordinarily he never cries unless 
something goes wrong. He knows 



THE BABY 



131 




he can get his food simply by 
altering his parameters to the right 
code.” 

“He’s really upset,” said Tanner. 
“Probably frustrated, too.” 

“He wants instant gratification,” 
said Dr. Corgan. “Like all infants, 
he wants what he wants right away. 
I’ll wait a few minutes and then 
help him. He’s got to learn that pa- 
tience is one of the facts of life.” 

The lights began to go on and 
off. The barbells rose and descend- 
ed. The bottle went in and out. An 
alarm bell rang. 

“Is the baby doing all that?" 
asked Tanner incredulously. 

“Yes,” said Dr. Corgan thought- 
fully. “You see, he’s trying every 
possible combination he knows, an 
excellent effort — one that deserves 
recognition. Now I’ll go in and help 
him." 

As Tanner watched, Dr. Corgan 
went into the laboratory and ex- 
amined the faulty bottle. As he 
tugged at the nipple, the barbells 
descended rapidly. 

“Look out!” called Tanner. 

Dr. Corgan jumped to the side as 
the barbells shot past his head. 
Then he refilled the bottle with 
fresh formula, attached a new 
nipple and inserted the bottle again 
into its holder. The bottle slid down 
and forward into the baby’s mouth 
and the crying choked into a soft 
gurgle of contentment. 

When he returned to the observ- 
ing room Dr. Corgan found Tanner 
in a state of agitation. 



“You could have been hurt,” he 
said. 

“I might have been if you hadn’t 
called out,” admitted Dr. Corgan. 
“I’ve got to be more alert. Our set- 
up is quite complicated, you know.” 

He answered a few more ques- 
tions and then Nurse Thompson 
came in, a look of triumph on her 
face. 

“It’s time for the baby to return 
to nursery,” she said, staring hard 
at Dr. Corgan. He was too distract- 
ed to notice her delight in her small 
victory. 

“Take him,” he said. 

“I’ve got to run, too,” said Tan- 
ner, stretching out his hand. “I 
want to thank you for all your 
help." 

W hen Tanner had gone Dr. 

Corgan fretted over the inter- 
view. Had he talked too freely? Had 
the emphasis been put inappro- 
priately? What impression would 
the press give the public about his 
work? Had Tanner been hostile? 
Would there be a lurid banner line 
like INFANTS TURNED TO AUTO- 
MATA, or THOUGHT CONTROL RE- 
ALIZED? Dr. Corgan sighed. Would 
anyone appreciate his true motiva- 
tion, which was to enrich the intel- 
lectual pleasures of every infant? 

He ate sparingly that night and 
slept badly in his bachelor bed. He 
was at the laboratory at seven the 
following morning, working on the 
bottle-nipple arrangement that had 
given him so much trouble during 



132 



GALAXY 




the interview. Perhaps the problem 
was the angle at which the bottle 
entered the baby’s mouth. He oper- 
ated the slide by hand and saw it 
come down and forward. It was 
possible that the whole arrange- 
ment was an eighth of an inch too 
high, enough to make the baby pull 
the nipple forward under too much 
stress, allowing the milk to leak. 

He began to laugh. It was 
incredible that an experiment of 
such complexity should founder be- 
cause of a bottle and nipple. He 
tried several positions for the 
holder and when the baby arrived 
he thought he had it properly ad- 
justed. But apparently he was 
wrong. He set and reset it, but the 
nipple kept sliding off the mouth of 
the bottle. 

By five-thirty Nurse Thompson 
was hovering about, crying the late- 
ness of the hour. He became fully 
exasperated. 

“Go home,” he said angrily. “I 
must get this fixed tonight. The 
baby will sleep in the laboratory 
crib and I’ll stay with him.” 

“But you’ll overtire him — ” 

“Please get but of here, Mrs. 
Thompson. I’ll assume all responsi- 
bility for what happens.” 

at last he thought he had it. 

“Ring the alarm bell,” he told 
the baby. 

The alarm rang and the bottle 
moved forward. The baby’s mouth 
seemed to leap at the bottle and the 
nipple flew off. A torrent of milk 



cascaded over the baby’s face. At 
first he seemed to strangle — then 
he coughed and finally bellowed his 
disappointment. 

“I’m. terribly sorry,” said Dr. 
Corgan. “It was all an accident. I’ll 
set it right.” 

He painstakingly reset the slide 
and replaced the nipple carefully 
on the bottle. Everything seemed 
perfect again. He was leaning over 
the apparatus, admiring his handi- 
work, when the barbell struck him 
heavily at the back of his skull and 
he tumbled to the floor, slowly sink- 
ing into a deep void. As he lay 
there, fighting the descent, he 
thought dimly. What a terrible ac- 
cident. / must call for help . 

From a vast distance he heard 
the sucking noise. How delightful 
to know that now everything was 
working perfectly. Next the door to 
the observing room closed and soon 
afterward the lights went out. 

With a terrible effort he lifted his 
head and looked about. 

What a marvelous little fellow he 
is. Dr. Corgan thought for a fleet- 
ing moment. He’s learned his les- 
sons beautifully. What a pity that 
no one else is here to see it .. 

The baby had stopped sucking 
now and was cooing contentedly. 
Dr. Corgan could imagine him ly- 
ing there in the darkness, round 
and amiable with pink plump 
cheeks that glowed like twin rose- 
buds. 

The soft pleasant gurgling noises 
were the last he heard. it

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

Helward Mann of Earth City has 
reached manhood at the age of six 
hundred and fifty miles. His age is 
reckoned by the city's progress to- 
ward the Optimum — e.g. from the 
moment of Helward’s birth Earth 
City has traveled six hundred and 
fifty miles toward this elusive goal, 
a process of which Helward knows 
little or nothing. His early years, 
spent in the creche with other city 
children, have been sheltered. His 
education has been Earth oriented 
and has given him little informa- 
tion about the planet the city now 
traverses. 

Following elaborate rites wel- 
coming him to adulthood — at 
which Helward elects to become an 
apprentice of the Future Surveyors' 
Guild and his engagement to a girl 
named Victoria Lerouex is an- 
nounced — Helward is permitted to 
see his first sunrise, actually his 
first glimpse of the outside. As- 
signed to serve his initial term as an 
apprentice with the Trackmen's 
Guild, he discovers that the city 
moves forward across the planet’s 
surface on rails painstakingly laid 
ahead of it and as painstakingly 
removed once they have served 
their purpose (a) to prevent the 
city's sliding backward and ( b ) to 
be reused. He also learns that the 
city is fusion- powered and is the 
sole source of the good life on the 
planet — it alone has adequate (if 
tasteless and synthetic) food, cloth- 



ing, medical and educational facili- 
ties. It uses these to barter for 
workers and women to bear 
children — of which it has a short- 
age— from among primitive tribes 
of aliens or “ looks " en route. The 
women acquired by barter remain 
in the city long enough to bear a 
child to a city male, are then 
returned to their tribes. 

The knowledge of how the city 
came to be is lost. It is. however, 
known that somehow it originated 
on Earth and that, in order to sur- 
vive, it must be winched constantly 
toward the Optimum, which moves 
ahead of it. Instructions to this ef- 
fect are contained in a document 
known as Destain’s Directive, 
handed down from the city's 
founder in some dim antiquity. 

Ideally the city should progress 
at the rate of one-tenth of a mile a 
day. This pace, however, is never 
maintained — there is uneven ter- 
rain to contend with; rivers and 
gorges must be bridged. The city 
has never been closer than three 
miles to the O ptimum. This, 
however, is enough to keep it alive 
and functioning. 

There is discontent both within 
and outside the city. Helward ex- 
periences both. Victoria, whom he 
has married, finds her life in urban 
confinement pointless. Helward 
has taken an apprentice's oath 
never to discuss the outside or the 
city’s relationship to it with the un- 
initiated under penalty of death. To 
save his marriage, however, he 



135 




breaks his vow in conversations 
with Victoria. He also is involved 
and injured in a riot of resentful 
"took" workers. 

After sen’ing his apprenticeship 
Helward is sent south — into the 
city's "past" — to escort home three 
local women for.whose child-bear- 
ing services the city has bartered to 
alleviate its woman-shortage. He 
discovers that the landscape that 
should have been familiar to him 
from the city's passage has subtly 
altered — a ravine the city had 
bridged with great difficulty has 
shrunk to a mere ditch; mountains 
have lost height. The terrain has 
flattened out and the tracks of the 
city's passing have spread out. 

The three women with him also 
seem to grow shorter and broader 
until they split their dresses and 
must proceed naked. He himself re- 
mains physically unchanged — but 
discovers himself experiencing a 
strange force pulling him south- 
ward , . 

He has a terrifying experience 
when this mysterious pull sweeps 
him off his feet, smashes him 
against a cliff, then drags him up 
the nearly vertical side of the 
mountain and threatens to hurl 
him to oblivion on the other side. 
He fights clear and, having lost the 
women, makes his way back to the 
city — only to find it under attack by 
armed ‘ ‘looks. ” 

Helward joins the defenders and 
the attack is repulsed. Parts of the 
city have been badly damaged, but 
it stubbornly continues its journey 
northward through this and subse- 
quent attacks. 

Other changes in the city that 



have taken place during his absence 
Helward finds more striking. Evi- 
dently more time has passed in the 
city than he had counted on. In the 
interim his wife has given birth to a 
child, who has died, and she has 
divorced him. The city has grown 
more reliant on its own manpower 
now that the countryside has 
rebelled against its hiring practices. 
Gradually, the city returns to 
norm — but it is a new norm. 

Helward adjusts to it. 



XXIX 

T he following day — when I rode 
north with Blayne to start the 
future survey — marked the begin- 
ning of a long period of regained 
security and radical changes for the 
city. 

I saw both processes develop 
gradually, for my own sense of 
actual city time was distorted by my 
journeys to the north. I learned by 
experience that a day spent at a dis- 
tance roughly twenty miles north of 
optimum was equivalent to an hour 
of elapsed time in the city. As far as 
possible I kept in touch with what 
happened by attending as many 
Navigators’ meetings as I could. 

The placidity of the city’s exis- 
tence that I had experienced when I 
first left to work outside returned 
more quickly than most people had 
expected. 

There were no more attacks by 
the tooks, although one of the mi- 
litiamen, engaged in an intelligence 
mission, was captured and killed. 
Soon after this the leaders of the 



136 



GALAXY 




militia announced that the tooks 
were dispersing and heading for 
their settlements in the south. 

Although military vigilance was 
maintained for a long time — and 
was never in fact wholly abandon- 
ed — men from the militia were 
gradually freed to work on other 
functions. 

As 1 had learned at that first 
Navigators’ meeting, the method of 
hauling the city was changed. After 
several initial difficulties had been 
overcome the operation was suc- 
cessfully converted to a system of 
continuous traction, using a com- 
plicated arrangement of alternating 
cables and phased track-laying. 
One-tenth of a mile in twenty-four 
hours was not, after all, a consider- 
able distance — and within a short 
time the city had reached optimum. 

This gain actually gave the city 
greater freedom of movement. 
From optimum it was possible, for 
instance, to take considerable de- 
tours from a bearing of true north if 
a sufficiently large obstacle were to 
appear. 

In actual fact, however, the ter- 
rain was good. As our surveys 
showed, the overall elevation of the 
land was falling and more gradients 
were in our favor than were against 
us. 

More rivers crossed this region 
than the Navigators would have 
liked and the Bridge-Builders were 
kept busy. But with the city at op- 
timum and with its greater capacity 
for speed relative to the movement 
of the ground more time was avail- 
able for decision-making and for 
building a safe bridge. 

With some hesitation at first, the 



barter system was reintroduced. 
Negotiations were conducted more 
scrupulously than before. The city 
paid more generously for man- 
power — which was still needed — 
and tried for a long time to avoid 
the necessity of bartering for 
women. 

Through a long series of Navi- 
gators’ meetings I followed the de- 
bate on this last subject. We still 
had . the seventeen transferred 
women inside the city who had been 
with us since before the first at- 
tack — they had expressed no desire 
to return to their villages. But the 
predominance of male births con- 
tinued and there was a strong lobby 
for the return of the transfer sys- 
tem. No one knew why there should 
be such an imbalance in the distri- 
bution of the sexes, but it was un- 
doubtedly so. Furthermore, three 
of the transferred women had given 
birth within the last few miles and 
each of these babies had been male. 
It was suggested that the longer 
women from outside remained in 
the city, the more chance there was 
that they, too, would produce male 
children. Again, no one understood 
why. 

At the last count there was a total 
of seventy-six male and fourteen 
female children below the age of 
one hundred and fifty miles. As the 
percentage continued to mount the 
Barter guild eventually was autho- 
rized to resume transfer negotia- 
tions. 

The decision served to highlight 
the social changes that were taking 
place. The open-city system had re- 
mained and non-guildsmen were 
allowed to attend Navigators’ meet- 



INVERTED WORLD 



137 




ings as spectators. Within a few 
hours of the announcement every- 
one in the city knew that the barter 
for women was being renewed and 
many voices were raised in protest. 
Nevertheless, the decision was im- 
plemented. 

Although hired labor was again 
being used, fewer men were taken 
on and a considerable number of 
people from the city continued to 
work on the tracks and cables. 
Hence there was not much that 
wasn’t known about the city’s 
operations. 

But general education about the 
real nature of the world on which 
we lived remained poor. 

D uring one debate I heard the 
word “Terminator” used for 
the first time. The Terminators ap- 
parently were a group of people 
who actively opposed the continued 
movement of the city and were 
committed to halting it. As far as 
was known they were not militant 
and would take no direct action, 
but they were gaining a consider- 
able amount of support within the 
city and a program of reeducation 
was begun to dramatize the neces- 
sity of moving the city northward. 

At the next Council meeting 
there was a violent disruption — a 
group of people burst into the 
chamber and tried to take the 
chair. I was not surprised to see 
that Victoria was among them. 

After a noisy argument the Navi- 
gators summoned the assistance of 
the militia and the meeting was 
closed. 

This disruption, perversely, had 
the effect desired by the Terminator 



movement — the Navigators’ meet- 
ings were once again closed to the 
public. The dichotomy in the 
opinions of the ordinary people of 
the city widened. The Terminators 
had a considerable amount of sup- 
port, but no real authority. 

A few incidents followed. A cable 
was found cut in mysterious cir- 
cumstances and a Terminator tried 
one day to speak to the hired men 
in an attempt to get them to return 
to their villages . still, by and 
large the Terminator movement 
was no more than a thorn in the 
side of the Navigators. 

Reeducation went well. A series 
of lectures attempted to explain the 
peculiar dangers of this world and 
they were well attended. The design 
of the hyperbola was adopted as the 
city’s motif and was worn as an or- 
nament on the guildsmen's cloaks, 
stitched inside the circle on their 
breasts. 

I don’t know how well the lec- 
tures were understood by the ordi- 
nary people of the city — I overheard 
some discussion of the subject but 
the influence of the Terminators 
perhaps weakened the program’s 
credibility. 

In spite of everything the city 
continued to move slowly north- 
ward. Sometimes I would take time 
off from other matters and try to 
view it in my mind’s eye as a tiny 
speck of matter on an alien world. I 
would see it as an object of one 
universe trying to survive in an- 
other — as a city full of people, 
holding on to the side of a forty-five 
degree slope, pulling its way against 
a tide of ground on a few thin 
strands of cable.

W ith the return to a more 
stable environment for the 
city the task of future surveying 
became more routine. 

For our purposes the ground to 
the north of the city was divided 
into a series of segments, radiating 
from optimum at five-degree inter- 
vals. Under normal circumstances 
the city would not seek a route that 
was more than fifteen degrees away 
from due north, but our extra 
capability to detour did allow con- 
siderable flexibility. 

Our procedure was simple. Sur- 
veyors would ride north from the 
city — either alone or, if they chose, 
in pairs — and conduct a compre- 
hensive survey of the segment 
allotted to them. There was plenty 
of time available to us. 

On many occasions I would find 
myself seduced by the feeling of 
freedom in the north — the experi- 
ence. Blayne once told me, was 
common to most Futures. Where 
was the urgency to return if a day 
spent lazily on the bank of a river 
wasted only a few minutes of the 
city’s time? 

T here was, however, a price to 
pay for the time spent in the 
north, though it did not seem real 
to me until I saw its effects for my- 
self. A day spent idling in the north 
was a day in my life. In fifty days I 
aged the equivalent of five miles in 
the city, but the city people had 
aged only four days. It did not 
matter at first — our return visits to 
the city were so frequent that I saw 
and felt no difference. But in time, 
the people I had known — Victoria, 
Jase, Malchuskin — seemed not to 



have aged at all, but catching a 
sight of myself in a mirror one day I 
saw the effect on myself. 

I did not want to settle down per- 
manently with another girl — 
Victoria’s notion that the ways of 
the city would disrupt any relation- 
ship took greater meaning for me 
every time I considered it. 

The first of the transferred 
women were coming to the city and 
as an unmarried man I was told 
that I was eligible to mate tempo- 
rarily with one of them. At first I 
resisted the idea because, to be 
frank, it repelled me. It seemed to 
me that even a purely physical 
affair should have some comple- 
ment in shared emotions. But 
whenever I was in the city I and 
other eligible men were encouraged 
to mix socially with the girls in a 
recreation room set aside for this 
purpose. I found these meetings 
embarrassing and humiliating at 
first, but as I grew used to them my 
inhibitions eventually waned. 

In time a girl named Dorita and I 
discovered a mutual liking. Soon 
she and I were allocated quarters 
for privacy. We did not have much 
in common, but her attempts to 
speak English were delightful and 
she seemed to enjoy my company. 
Soon she was pregnant and between 
my surveying missions I watched 
her pregnancy proceed. 

Slowly, so unbelievably slowly. 

I began to grow increasingly 
frustrated with the apparently 
sluggish progress of the city. By my 
own subjective time scale, a hun- 
dred and fifty, perhaps two hun- 



INVERTED WORLD 



139 




dred miles had elapsed since I had 
become a Future guildsman — yet 
the city was still in sight of the hills 
we had been passing through at the 
time of the attacks. 

I applied for a temporary trans- 
fer to another guild. Much as 1 
enjoyed the, leisured life in the 
future I felt that time was passing' 
me by. 

For a few miles 1 worked with the 
Traction guild and it was during 
this period that Dorita gave birth. 
She produced twins — a boy and a 
girl. Much celebration . but I 
found that the city life discontented 
me in another way. 1 had been 
working with Jase, who had once 
been several miles older than I. 
Now he was clearly younger and we 
had little in common. 

Shortly after she had given birth 
Dorita left the city and I returned 
to my own guild. 

Like the Future guildsmen I had 
seen as an apprentice, 1 was becom- 
ing a misfit in the city. I enjoyed my 
own company, relished those stolen 
hours in the north, was uncomfort- 
able in the city. I had developed an 
interest in drawing, but told almost 
no one about it. I did my guild 
work as quickly and efficiently as 
possible, then rode off alone 
through the future countryside, 
sketching what 1 saw, trying to find 
in line drawings some expression of 
a terrain where time could almost 
stand still. 

I watched the city from a dis- 
tance, seeing it as something 
alien — not of this world, no longer 
even of me. Mile by mile it hauled 
itself forward, never finding or even 



seeking a final resting place.

S he waited in the doorway of the 
church while the discussion 
continued on the far side of the 
square. Behind her, in the tempo- 
rary workshop, the priest and two 
assistants were working patiently at 
restoring the plaster image of the 
Virgin Mary. The church was cool 
and, in spite of the partly caved-in 
roof, clean and restful. She knew 
she shouldn’t be here, but some in- 
stinct had sent her inside when the 
two men had arrived. 

She watched them talking ear- 
nestly to Luiz Carvalho, the self-ap- 
pointed leader of the village, and a 
handful of other men. In other 
times the priest, perhaps, would 
have assumed responsibility for the 
community, but Father dos Santos 
was, like herself, a newcomer. 

The men had ridden into the vil- 
lage along the dried-up streambed 
and now their horses grazed while 
the discussion continued. She was 
too far away to hear the actual 
words, but it seemed to her that 
some deal was being struck. The 
men from the village talked 
volubly, feigning no interest, but 
she knew that if their attention had 
not been caught they would not still 
be talking. 

It was the horsemen who held her 
interest. That they were not from 
any of the nearby villages was self- 
evident. Their appearance con- 
trasted strikingly with that of the 



140 



GALAXY 




villagers — each wore a black cape, 
well-fitting trousers and leather 
boots. Their horses were saddled 
and apparently groomed and, 
though each carried large saddle- 
bags loaded with equipment, they 
stood without apparent fatigue. No 
local horse was in such good con- 
dition. 

Her curiosity began to override 
her instinct and she stepped for- 
ward to learn for herself what was 
going on. As she did so the negotia- 
tions appeared to have been com- 
pleted, for the village men turned 
away and the other two returned to 
their horses. 

They mounted immediately and 
headed back the way they had 
come. She stood and watched 
them, debating whether or not to 
follow. 

When they disappeared among 
the trees that grew along the stream 
she ran between two of the houses 
and scrambled up the rise of 
ground behind the village. After a 
few moments she saw the men 
emerging from the trees. They drew 
rein and halted. 

They conferred for about five 
minutes, several times looking back 
in the general direction of the 
village. 

She kept out of sight, standing in 
the dense scrub that grew all over 
the hill. Suddenly one of the men 
raised his hand to the other and 
swung his horse around. He set off 
at a gallop in the direction of some 
distant hills — the other man turned 
his animal in the opposite direction 
and walked it at a leisured pace. 

She returned to the village and 
found Luiz. 



“What did they want?” she 
asked. 

“They need men for some work.” 
“Did you agree to this?” 

He looked evasive. “They're 
coming back tomorrow.” 

“Are they going to pay?” 

“With food. Look.” 

He held out a handful of bread 
and she took it from him. It was 
brown and fresh and smelled good. 
“Where did they get this?” 

Luiz shrugged. “They also have 
other food." 

“Did they give you any of that?” 
“No.” 

She frowned, wondering again 
who the men might be. 

“Anything else?” 

“Only this." He showed her a 
small bag and she opened it. Inside 
was a coarse white powder and she 
sniffed at it. 

“They said it would make fruit 
grow.” 

“They have more of this?” 

“As much as we need." 

She put the bag down and went 
back to the church workshop. After 
a word with Father dos Santos she 
walked quickly to the stables and 
saddled up her own horse. 

She rode out of the village by way 
of the dried-up stream and followed 
in the direction of the second man. 



B eyond the village stretched a 
wide area of scrubland dotted 
with trees. She soon saw the second 
man some distance ahead of her, 
still walking his horse toward 
denser woodland, beyond which a 
river flowed. 

She kept her distance, not wish- 



INVERTED WORLD 



141 




ing to be seen until she found out 
where he was heading. 

When he entered the woods she 
lost sight of him and dismounted. 
She led her horse by its reins, keep- 
ing a wary eye for any sign. Soon 
she could hear the sound of the 
river, shallow at this season, its bed 
noisy with pebbles. 

She saw his horse first — it was 
tethered to a tree. She tied up her 
own animal and continued afoot. 
The air was warm and still under 
the trees and she felt dusty from the 
ride. She wondered suddenly what 
had prompted her to follow this 
man when reason warned her of 
any number of possible risks. But 
something about him — and his 
companion — was different from 
anything she had known. 

She moved more cautiously as 
she approached the edge of the 
wood. Here she halted, looking 
down the shallow bank toward the 
water. 

The man was there and she 
studied him with interest. 

He had discarded his cloak. It 
lay with his boots beside a small 
pile of equipment. He had waded 
into the river, and was clearly rel- 
ishing the coolness of the water. 
Completely oblivious of her pres- 
ence, he kicked his feet in the 
water, sending up showers of 
glittering spray. In a moment he 
bent down, scooped up some water 
in his hands and splashed it over 
his face and neck. 

He turned, waded out of the 
water and bent over his equipment 
on the shore. From a black leather 
case he took what seemed to her a 
small camera, suspended the case 



by its strap over his shoulder and 
connected it to the camera with a 
short lead. This done, he adjusted a 
small ferruled knob on the side. 

He put down the camera for a 
moment and unfurled a long paper 
roll, wound like a scroll. He laid 
this on the ground, looked at it 
thoughtfully for a few seconds, then 
picked up the camera and returned 
to the water’s edge. 

Deliberately he pointed the 
camera upstream for a second or 
two, then lowered it and turned. He 
pointed it at the opposite bank and 
then, startling her, pointed it in her 
direction. She ducked down out of 
sight and from his lack of reaction 
guessed he had not seen her. When 
she looked again he was pointing 
the camera downstream. 

He returned to the length of 
paper and with great care inscribed 
a few symbols. 

Still moving deliberately, he put 
the camera back in its case, rolled 
up the paper and stowed it with the 
rest of the equipment. 

He stretched elaborately, then 
scratched the back of his head. 
Listlessly he returned to the water’s 
edge, sat down and dangled his feet 
in the water. In a moment he 
sighed and lay back, his eyes 
closed. 

S he regarded him closely. He 
certainly looked harmless 
enough. He was big, well-muscled, 
and his face and arms were deeply 
tanned. His hair was long and 
shaggy, a great mane of light au- 
burn. He wore a beard. She esti- 
mated him to be somewhere in his 
middle thirties. In spite of the 



142 



GALAXY 




beard he had a clean-cut, youthful 
face, grinning at the simple animal 
bliss of cold wet feet on a hot dry 
day. 

Flies hovered around his face 
and from time to time he would 
swipe at them lazily. 

After a few more moments of 
hesitation she started forward and 
half-walked, half-skidded down the 
bank, pushing a minor avalanche 
of soil before her. 

The man’s reaction was im- 
mediate. He sat up, looked around 
sharply and scrambled to his feet. 
In so doing he turned awkwardly, 
and slipped down on his stomach, 
his feet thrashing in the water. 

She started to laugh. 

He recovered his foothold and 
dove for his equipment. A few 
seconds later he had a rifle in his 
hands. 

She stopped laughing . but 
he did not raise the rifle. 

Instead he said something in 
Spanish so bad that she could not 
understand him. 

She spoke only a little Spanish 
herself, so she said in the language 
of the villagers, “I didn't mean to 
laugh.” 

He shook his head, then looked 
at her carefully. She spread her 
hands to prove that she carried no 
kind of weapon and gave him what 
she hoped was a reassuring smile. 
He seemed satisfied that she pre- 
sented no threat to him and put 
down the rifle. 

Again he said something in atro- 
cious Spanish, then muttered a few 
words in English. 

“Do you speak English?” she 
asked . 



“Yes. Do you?” 

“Like a native.” She laughed 
again and asked, “Do you mind if I 
join you?” 

She nodded toward the river, but 
he continued to stare dumbly at 
her. She slipped off her shoes and 
walked down to the water. She 
waded in, hitching up her skirt. 
The water was cold — it made her 
toes curl, but the sensation was de- 
lightful. In a moment she sat on the 
ground, keeping her feet in the 
water. 

He came to sit beside her. 

“Sorry about the gun. You star- 
tled me.” 

“I’m sorry, too,” she said. “But 
you looked so blissful.” 

“To relax and cool off is the best 
thing to do on a day like this.” 

Together they stared down at the 
water flowing over their feet. Be- 
neath the rippling surface white 
flesh seemed to flicker like a flame 
in a draft. 

“What’s your name?” she asked. 

“Helward.” 

“Helward?” She tried the sound 
of the word. “Is that a surname?” 

“No. My full name is Helward 
Mann. What’s yours?” 

“Elizabeth. Elizabeth Khan. I 
don’t like being called Elizabeth.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

She glanced at him. He looked 
very serious. 

She was a little confused by his 
accent. She had realized he was not 
a native of this region and he spoke 
English naturally and without ef- 
fort, but he had a strange way of 
pronouncing his vowels. 

“Where do you come from?” she 
said. 



INVERTED WORLD 



143 




“Around here.” He stood up 
suddenly. “I’d better water the 
animal.” 



H e stumbled again as he 
climbed the bank, but this 
time Elizabeth did not laugh. He 
walked straight into the trees, did 
not pick up his equipment. The 
rifle was still there. He looked over 
his shoulder at her once and she 
turned away. 

When he returned he was leading 
both horses. She stood up and led 
her mount to the water. 

Standing between the horses, 
Elizabeth stroked the neck of Hel- 
ward’s. 

“She’s beautiful,” she said. “Is 
she yours?” 

“Not really. I just ride her more 
often than any of the others.” 
“What do you call her?” 

“I — haven’t given her a name. 
Should I?” 

“Only if you want to. Mine 
hasn't got a name either.” 

“I enjoy riding,” Helward said 
suddenly. “It’s the best part of my 
work.” 

“That and paddling in rivers. 
What do you do?” 

“I’m a ... I mean, it hasn’t 
really got a label. What about 
you?” 

“I’m a nurse. Officially, that is. I 
do lots of things. 

“We have nurses,” he said. “In 
the — where I come from.” 

She looked at him with new in- 
terest. “Where’s that?” 

“A city. In the south.” 

“What’s it called?” 

“Earth. Although most of the 



time we just call it the city.” 

Elizabeth smiled uncertainly, not 
sure she had heard correctly. “Tell 
me about it.” 

He shook his head. The horses 
had finished drinking and were 
nuzzling each other. 

“I think I'd better be on my 
way,” he said. 

He walked quickly toward his 
equipment, scooped it up and 
stuffed it hurriedly into the saddle- 
bags. Elizabeth watched curiously. 
When he had finished he took the 
rein, turned the horse around and 
led it up the bank. At the fringe of 
the trees he looked back. 

“I’m sorry. You must think me 
very rude. It’s just that you’re not 
like the others.” 

“The others?” 

“The people around here.” 

“Is that so bad?” 

“No.” He looked around the 
riverside as if seeking some further 
excuse to stay with her. Abruptly he 
seemed to change his mind about 
leaving. He tethered the horse to 
the nearest tree. “Can I ask you 
something?” 

“Of course." 

“I wonder — would you let me 
draw you?” 

“Draw me?” 

“Yes — just a sketch. I’m not very 
good — I haven’t been doing it very 
long. While I’m up here I spend a 
lot of time drawing what I see.” 
“Was that what you were doing 
before 1 came down? I saw you with 
some papers.” 

“That was just a map.” 

“All right. Do you want me to 
pose for you?" 

He fumbled in his saddlebag, 



144 



GALAXY 




then brought out a sheaf of papers 
in assorted sizes. He flicked ner- 
vously through the sheets and she 
saw that some had line drawings on 
them. 

“Just stand there,” he said. 
“No — beside your horse.” 

H e sat down on the edge of the 
bank, balancing the papers on 
his knees. She watched him, a little 
disconcerted by this sudden devel- 
opment, and felt a growing self- 
consciousness that was generally 
alien to her personality. He stared 
over the paper at her. 

She stood by the horse, her arm 
reaching under its heck to pat. the 
other side, and the horse responded 
by pressing its nose against her. 

“You’re standing wrong,” he 
said. “Turn more toward me.” 

The self-consciousness grew and 
she realized she was standing in an 
unnatural, awkward posture. 

He worked away, using one sheet 
of paper after the next, and she 
began to relax. She decided to pay 
no attention to him and petted the 
horse again. After a while he asked 
her to sit in the saddle, but she was 
growing tired. 

“Can I see what you’ve done?” 
“1 never show my drawings to 
anyone.” 

“Please, Helward. I’ve never 
posed before.” 

He sifted through the papers and 
selected a few. “I don’t know what 
you'll think.” 

She took them from him. 

“God, am I as skinny as that?” 
she said without thinking. 

He tried to take the drawings 
away from her. “Give them back.” 



She turned away from him and 
flicked through the rest. It was 
possible to see that they were of 
her, but his sense of proportion 
was — unusual. Both she and the 
horse were drawn too tall and thin. 
The effect was not unpleasing, but 
it was weird. 

“Please — I’d like them back.” 
She gave them to him and he put 
them at the bottom of the pile. 
Abruptly he turned his back on her 
and walked toward his horse. 

“Have I offended you?” she 
asked. 

“It’s all right. I knew I shouldn't 
have shown them to you.” 

“I think they're excellent. It’s 
just — it’s a bit of a shock to see 
yourself through someone else’s 
eyes. I told you I had never posed 
before." 

“You're difficult to draw.” 
“Could I see some of your 
others?” 

“You wouldn’t be interested.” 
“Look, I’m not just trying to 
smooth your ruffled feathers. I 
really am interested.” 

“Okay.” 

H e gave her the whole pile and 
continued toward his horse. 
She sat down again and began to go 
through the drawings, aware of him 
in the background pretending to 
adjust the horse’s harness, but in 
fact watching her covertly, trying to 
anticipate her response. 

He had drawn a variety of sub- 
jects. There were several of his 
horse: grazing, standing, throwing 
back its head. These were amazing- 
ly naturalistic — with a few lines he 
had caught the very essence of the 



INVERTED WORLD 



145 




animal, proud yet docile, tamed yet 
still its own master. Curiously, the 
proportions were exactly right. 
There were several drawings of a 
man — self-portraits, or the man 
she had seen him with earlier? He 
was drawn in his cloak, without his 
cloak, standing by a horse, using 
the camera she had seen earlier. 
Again the proportions were almost 
exactly right. 

A few sketches were of scenery — 
trees, a river, a curious structure 
being dragged by ropes, a distant 
range of hills. He was not as adept 
with views. Sometimes his propor- 
tions were good, at other times 
there was a disturbing distortion 
that she could not quite identify. 
Something wrong with the perspec- 
tive? She couldn’t tell. 

At the bottom of the pile she 
found the drawings he had made of 
her. The first few were not very 
good, clearly hfs first attempts. 
Three of those he had shown her 
were by far the best, but there was 
still this elongation of her and the 
horse that puzzled her. 

“Well?” he asked. 

“I — ” She couldn’t find the right 
words. “I think they’re good — some 
are unusual. You’ve an excellent 
eye." 

“You’re a difficult subject.” 

“I particularly like this one.” 
She searched through the pile, 
found one of the horse with its 
mane flying wild. “It’s lifelike.” 

He grinned then. ‘‘That’s my 
own favorite.” 

She glanced again through the 
drawings. Something about a few 
of them she hadn’t understood — 
there, in one of the drawings of the 



man. High in the background hung 
a weird, four-pointed shape. There 
was one in each of the sketches he 
had done of her. 

“What’s this?” she said, point- 
ing to it. 

“The sun.” 

She frowned a little, but decided 
not to pursue the subject. She felt 
she had done enough damage to his 
ego for the moment. 

She selected what she thought 
was the best of the three. 

“Could I have this one?” 

“I thought you didn’t like it.” 

“I do. I think it’s marvelous.” 

He looked at her carefully, as if 
trying to divine whether she was 
being truthful, then again took the 
pile from her. 

“Would you like this one, too?” 
He handed her the one of the 
horse. 

. “I couldn’t. Not that one.” 

“I’d like you to have it,” he said. 
“You’re the first person to have 
seen it.” 

“I — thank you.” 

He placed the papers carefully 
into the saddlebag and buckled the 
cover. 

“Did you say your name was 
Elizabeth?” 

“I prefer to be called Liz.” 

He nodded gravely. “Goodbye, 
Liz." 

“Are you going?” 

He didn’t answer, but untethered , 
the horse and swung into the 
saddle. He rode down the bank, 
splashed through the shallow water 
of the river and spurred his horse 
on up the opposite bank. In a few 
seconds he was lost to sight among 
the trees.

B ack at the village Elizabeth 
found she had no appetite for 
more work. She was still waiting for 
a consignment of proper medical 
supplies and a doctor had been 
promised for more than a month. 
She had done what she could to see 
that the villagers were getting a 
balanced diet — but food supplies 
were limited — and she had been 
able to deal with the more obvious 
ailments such as sores, rashes and 
so forth. Last week she had helped 
deliver a baby for one of the women 
and for the first time had felt she 
was accomplishing something. 

Now, with the strange encounter 
by the river still fresh in her mind, 
she decided to return to headquar- 
ters early. 

She found Luiz before she left. 
“If those men come back,” she 
said, “try to find out what it is they 
want. I’ll be back in the morning. 
If they come before 1 arrive try to 
keep them here. Find out where 
they’re from.” 

By the time she had covered the 
seven miles to headquarters it was 
evening. The place was almost de- 
serted — many of the field opera- 
tives stayed out for several nights 
on end. Tony Chappell was there, 
though, and he intercepted her as 
she headed for her room. 

“Are you free this evening, Liz? I 
thought we might — ” 

“I’m very tired. I thought I’d 
have an early night.” 

When she had first arrived Eliza- 
beth had felt faint stirrings of at- 
traction toward Chappell and had 
made the mistake of showing them. 
There were only a few women at the 
station and he had responded with 



great eagerness. Since then he had 
hardly left her alone and she hadn’t 
yet discovered a polite way of cool- 
ing his ardor. 

In her room she dumped her bag 
on the bed, undressed and took a 
long shower. Later she went to find 
something to eat and, inevitably, 
Tony joined her. 

During the meal she remembered 
she had been meaning to ask him 
something. 

“Do you know any towns around 
here called Earth?" 

“Earth? Like the planet?” 

“That’s what it sounded like. I 
might have heard wrong.” 

He shook his head. “Where- 
abouts?" 

“Somewhere around here. Not 
far.” 

“Urf? Or Mirth?” He laughed. 
“Are you sure?” 

“No — not really. I think I must 
have gotten it wrong.” 

In his own inimitable way Tony 
continued to make poor jokes 
about what she might have heard 
until she found an excuse to get 
away. 

There was a large map of the 
region in one of the offices, but she 
couldn’t see anything that might 
sound like the town where Helward 
had said he lived. He had described 
it as a city lying in the south, but 
there was no large settlement for 
nearly sixty miles. 

She was genuinely exhausted and 
returned to her room. 

She undressed and took the two 
sketches Helward had given her 
and taped them to the wall by the 
bed. The one of her was so 
strange . 



INVERTED WORLD 



147 




She looked at it more closely. 
The paper he had used was evident- 
ly quite old, for its edges were 
yellowed. Looking at the edges, she 
realized that the top and bottom 
were slightly burred where they had 
been torn, but the line was quite 
straight. * 

Experimentally she ran the tip of 
her finger along it — the paper had 
been perforated. 

Careful not to damage the draw- 
ing, she separated the tape from 
the wall and took down the sketch. 

On the back she discovered that 
a column of numbers had been 
printed down one side. Some were 
asterisked . 

Printed in pale blue ink along the 
side were the words: IBM Multifold 
TM. 

She taped the sketch again to the 
wall — and stared at it uncompre- 
hendingly for a long time. 

I n the morning Elizabeth put in 
another teleprinted request for a 
doctor, then set out for the village. 

She arrived in the heat of the day 
to find the place steeped in listless- 
ness and lethargy. She sought out 
Luiz, found him sitting in the 
shadow of the church with two 
other men. 

She asked, “Have the strangers 
been back?” 

“Not today, Menina Khan.” 
“When did they say they’d come 
again?” 

Luiz shrugged. “Sometime. To- 
day, tomorrow.” 

“Have you tried that — ” 

She stopped, irritated with her- 
self. She had meant to take the pur- 
ported fertilizer to headquarters to 



have it analyzed and in her preoc- 
cupaton had forgotten it. 

“Let me know if they come.” 

She went to see Maria and her 
new baby, but her mind was not 
fully on her work. Later she super- 
vised a meal, that was served to all 
comers, then talked to Father dos 
Santos in the workshop. All this 
time she had one ear cocked for any 
sound of horses. 

No longer trying to make any ex- 
cuses for herself, she went down to 
the stable, saddled up and rode out 
of the village, toward the river. 
She was trying not to dwell on her 
own thoughts, trying not to examine 
her own motives, but failed. The 
last twenty-four hours had been 
momentous in their own way. She 
had come out here to work because 
of a feeling that her life at home 
had been without meaning — only to 
find new frustrations among these 
impoverished villagers. What she 
could offer them was too little and 
too late. A few government hand- 
outs of grain, a few inoculations, a 
repaired church might be better 
than nothing — but the root of the 
local poverty problem remained un- 
solved because the central economy 
had failed. There was nothing on 
this land but what the people them- 
selves could take. 

The intrusion of Helward into 
her life was the first event of in- 
terest she had experienced since she 
arrived. She knew, as she rode 
across the scrubland toward the 
trees, that her motives regarding 
him were mixed. She admitted to 
curiosity — but something in the 
situation reached deeper. 

The men stationed here — her co- 



146 



GALAXY 




workers — were obsessed with them- 
selves and what they imagined their 
missions in life to be. They spoke in 
abstracts about group psychology, 
social readjustment, patterns of be- 
havior — in her more cynical moods 
she found their self-important out- 
look pathetic. Apart from the un- 
fortunate Tony Chappell, she had 
formed no kind of interest in any of 
them — which was not at all as she 
had anticipated before she arrived. 

Helward was different. She re- 
frained from spelling it out to her- 
self, but she knew why she was 
riding out to find him. 

X he found their yesterday’s meet- 
ing place on the riverbank and 
wed her horse to drink. Then 
she tethered it in the shade and sat 
down at the water’s edge to wait. 
Again she tried to blank out the 
turmoil of mental activity: 
thoughts, desires, questions. Con- 
centrating hard on the physical en- 
vironment, she lay back on the 
bank in the sunshine and closed her 
eyes. She listened to the sound of 
the water as it ran over the pebbles, 
the sigh of the wind in the trees, the 
humming of insects. She inhaled 
the smell of dry undergrowth, hot 
soil, warmth. 

A long time passed. Behind her 
the horse whisked its tail every few 
seconds, patiently flicking away 
swarming flies. 

She opened her eyes as soon as 
she heard the sound of the other 
horse and sat up. 

Helward sat his mount on the op- 
posite bank. He raised his hand in 
greeting and she waved back. 

He dismounted immediately and 



she smiled to herself. He seemed in 
high spirits and tried a handstand 
to amuse her. After two attempts 
he made it, then toppled over and 
landed with a shout and a splash in 
the river. 

Elizabeth jumped up and ran 
through the shallow water toward 
him. 

“Are you all right?” 

He grinned at her. “I could do 
that when I was a kid.” 

“So could I.” 

He stood up, looking down rue- 
fully at his soaked clothes. 

“They’ll soon dry,” she said. 

“I’ll get my horse.” 

They splashed across to her side 
of the river and Helward stood his 
horse next to Elizabeth’s. She sat 
down on the bank again and Hel- 
ward came to sit close beside her, 
stretching out his legs in the sun so 
that his clothes might dry. 

Behind them the horses stood 
nose to tail, whisking flies. 

^"Vuestions, questions — but she 
\J suppressed them all. She en- 
joygd the intrigue, didn’t want to 
destroy it with understanding. The 
rational explanation would be that 
he was an operative from a station 
similar to hers and that he was en- 
joying an elaborate and somewhat 
pointless joke at her expense. She 
didn’t care — his presence was 
enough and she was herself suffi- 
ciently emotionally suppressed to 
relish the break with routine he was 
bringing her. 

The only common bond between 
them that she knew of was that she 
was the only person to whom he 
had shown his sketches and she 



INVERTED WORLD 



149 




asked to see them again. For a 
while they talked about the draw- 
ings and he spoke of his various en- 
thusiasms — she was interested to 
see that all the sketches were on the 
back of old computer printout 
paper. 

Eventually Jie said, “I thought 
you were a took.” 

He pronounced it with a long 
vowel, like “shoot." 

“What’s that?” 

“One of the people who live 
around here. But they don’t speak 
English.” 

“A few do. Not very well. Only 
when we teach them.” 

“Who is ‘we’?” 

“The people I work for.” 
“You’re not from the city — ” he 
said suddenly, then looked away. 

Elizabeth felt a glimmer of 
alarm. He had looked and acted 
like this the day before and then he 
had suddenly left. She didn’t. want 
that now. 

"Do you mean your city?” 

“No — of course you’re not. Who 
are you?” 

“You know my name,” she said. 
“Yes, but where are you from?” 
"England. 1 came here about two 
months ago.” 

“England — that’s on Earth, isn’t 
it?” He was staring at her intently, 
the drawings forgotten now. 

She laughed, a nervous reaction 
to the strangeness of the question. 

“It was the last time I was 
there,” she said, trying to make a 
joke of it. 

"My God! Then — ” 

“What?” 

He stood up abruptly and turned 
away from her. He took a few steps, 



then turned again and stood over 
her, staring down. 

“You’ve come from Earth?” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Are you from Earth — the 
planet?” 

“Of course — I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“You’re looking for us,” he said. 
“No! I mean — I’m not sure.” 
“You’ve found us!” 

She stood up, backed away from 
him. 

S he waited beside the horses. 

The aura of strangeness had be- 
come one of madness and she knew 
she should leave. The next move 
must come from him. 

"Elizabeth — don’t go.” 

“Liz,” she said. 

“Liz — do you know who I am? 
I’m from the city of Earth. You 
must know what that means.” 
“No, I don’t.” 

“You haven’t heard about us?” 
“No.” 

“We’ve been here for thousands 
of miles — many years. Nearly two 
hundred." 

“Where is the city?” 

He waved his arm in a northeast 
direction. “Down there. About 
twenty-five miles to the south.” 

She didn’t react to the contra- 
diction of direction, assumed he 
had made a mistake. 

“May I see the city?” she said. 
“Of course!” He took her hand 
excitedly and placed it on the rein 
of her horse. “We’ll go now.” 
“Wait. How do you spell the 
name of your city?” 

He spelled it for her. 

“Why is it called that?” 



150 



GALAXY 




“I don’t know. Because we are 
from the planet Earth, I suppose.” 

“Why do you differentiate be- 
tween the two?” 

“Because — isn’t it obvious?” 

“No.” 

She realized she was humoring 
him as if he were a maniac, but 
only excitement shone in his eyes, 
not madness. Her instinct, though, 
on which she had been so depen- 
dent recently, warned her to be 
careful. She could not be sure of 
anything now. 

“But this is not Earth,” he said. 

She said, “Helward — meet me 
here tomorrow. By the stream.” 

“I thought you wanted to see our 
city." 

“Yes — but not today. If it is 
twenty-five miles away I would have 
to get a fresh horse, tell my su- 
periors.” She was making excuses. 

He looked at her uncertainly. 

“You think I’m making it up,” 
he said. 

“No.” 

“Then what’s wrong? I tell you, 
as long as I can remember and for 
many years before I was born the 
city has survived in the hope that 
help would come from Earth. Now 
you are here and you think I am 
mad — ” 

“You are on Earth.” 

He opened his mouth, closed it 
again. 

“Why do you say that?” he said. 

“Why should I say otherwise?” 

He took her arm again and 
whirled her round. He pointed up- 
ward. 

“What do you see?" 

She shielded her eyes against the 
glare. “The sun.” 



“The sun! The sun! What about 
the sun?” 

“Nothing. Let go of my arm — 
you’re hurting me!” 

He released her and scrambled 
over to the discarded drawings. He 
took the top one, held it out for her 
to see. 

“That is the sun!” he shouted, 
pointing at the weird shape drawn 
at the top right of the picture, a few 
inches from the spindly figure he 
had said was she. “There is the 
sun!” 

Heart beating furiously she un- 
tied her horse, climbed into the 
saddle and kicked in her heels. The 
horse wheeled and she rode away at 
a gallop. 

Helward stood looking after her, 
still holding out his drawing. 



XXXII 

I t was evening by the time Eliza- 
beth reached the village — the 
hour was too late for her to set out 
for headquarters. She had no will 
to return there anyway and there 
was a place in the village where she 
could sleep. 

The main street was empty of 
people — unusual, for this early eve- 
ning hour was a popular one with 
the people for sitting in the dust ut- 
side their houses and talking idly 
while they drank the strong resi- 
nous wine that was all they could 
ferment around here. 

Sounds were coming from the 
church and she headed that way. 
Most of the men of the village were 
gathered inside — and few of the 
women. 



INVERTED WORLD

One or two girls were crying. 

“What’s going on?” Elizabeth 
asked Father dos Santos. 

‘‘Those men came back,” he 
said. “They’ve offered a deal." 

He was standing well to one side, 
obviously incapable of influencing 
the people in any way. 

Elizabeth tried to catch the gist 
of the discussion, but there was 
much shouting and even Luiz, who 
stood prominently near the wrecked 
altar, could not make himself 
heard over the hubbub. Elizabeth 
caught his eye and he came to her 
at once. 

“Well?’’ 

‘The men came today, Menina 
Khan. We are agreeing to their 
terms.” 

‘‘it doesn't sound like there’s 
much agreement. What are their 
terms?” 

“Fair.” 

He started to head back toward 
the altar, but Elizabeth caught his 
arm. 

“What did they want?” she said. 

“They will give us many medi- 
cines and a lot of food. There is 
more of the fertilizer and they say 
they will help repair the church, 
though that is not wished by us.” 

He was looking at her evasively, 
his gaze flickering up to her eyes, 
then away, then back again. 

“And in return?” 

“Only a little.” 

“Come on, Luiz. What did they 
want?” 

“Ten of our women. Is nothing.” 

She stared at him in amazement. 
“What did you — ” 

“They will be well looked after. 
They will make them healthy, and 



when they return to us they will 
bring more food.” 

“And what do the women say to 
that?” 

He glanced over his shoulder. 
“They are not happy.” 

“I'll bet they’re not.” She looked 
at the six women present. They 
stood in a small group and the men 
nearest to them looked sheepish. 
“What do they want them for?” 

“We do not ask.” 

“Because you think you know.” 
She turned to dos Santos. “What’s 
going to happen?” 

“They’ve already made up their 
minds,” he said. 

“But why? Surely they can’t 
seriously consider trading their 
wives and daughters for a few sacks 
of grain?” 

Luiz said, “We need what they 
offer. ’’ 

“But we have already promised 
you food. There is a doctor on his 
way now.” 

“Yes — and so you have prom- 
ised. Two months you have been 
here and very little food, no doctor. 
These men are honorable. We can 
tell.” 

He returned to face the crowd. In 
a moment he called for a vote by 
show of hands. The deal was con- 
firmed. None of the women voted. 

E lizabeth passed a restless 
night, but by the time she rose 
in the morning she knew what she 
was going to do. 

The day had produced a volume 
of unexpected developments. Ironi- 
cally, the one of which she had felt 
instinctively confident had not ma- 
terialized. Now that her encounter 



152 



GALAXY 




with Helward had taken on a new 
perspective, she could put words to 
what she had expected: the stirring 
inside her had been a physical rest- 
lessness, and she had ridden down 
to the river in full expectation of be- 
ing seduced by him. It could have 
happened, she now knew, until the 
moment the fanatical expression 
had seized his eyes. She still experi- 
enced stirrings of what she had 
felt — not fear, not amazement, but 
something between — during the 
last shouted conversation under the 
trees. 

What about the sun ? 

Undoubtedly there had been 
more to the scene than she had 
grasped. Helward’s behavior the 
day before had been different — she 
had tapped a hidden sensitivity and 
he had responded the way any man 
would. He had shown no sign of 
madness then.< 

Some mystery was attached to his 
use of computer paper. She knew of 
only one computer within a thou- 
sand miles of here and she also 
knew where it was and what it was 
used for. It didn’t use paper print- 
outs, and it certainly wasn’t an 
IBM. She knew of IBMs — anyone 
trained in the basics of computers 
had heard of them, but no machine 
had been made by IBM since the 
Crash. Certainly the only ones in- 
tact, if not working, were in 
museums. 

Finally, the deal proposed by the 
men who had visited the village had 
been wholly unanticipated, at least 
by her. Although, remembering 
Luiz’s expression after he had first 
spoken to the men, she felt sure 
that he had had from the start at 



least an inkling of what had been 
expected by way of payment. 

Somehow all must be connected. 
She knew the men who had come to 
the village were from the same 
place as Helward — and that his be- 
havior was linked in some way to 
this deal. 

There remained the question of 
her own involvement. 

Technically, the village and its 
people were the responsibility of 
her and dos Santos. Headquarters 
was primarily interested in oversee- 
ing the repair of a big harbor on the 
coast — only once had a supervisor 
visited the village. In theory Eliza- 
beth was in the charge of dos 
Santos, but he was a local man who 
had been one of the several 
hundred students who had been 
rushed through the government 
theological college in an effort to 
take religion back to the outlying 
regions. Religion was the tradition- 
al opiate here and missionary work 
was given a high priority in govern- 
ment circles. But the facts of the 
situation spoke for themselves: dos 
Santos’s work would take years and 
for most of the early ones he would 
be working uphill toward reestab- 
lishing the church as the social and 
spiritual leader of the community. 
The villagers tolerated him, but it 
was of Luiz they took notice — and, 
to a certain extent, of herself. 

If any action were to be taken it 
would have to be on her own initia- 
tive. 

The decision did not come quick- 
ly. Throughout that long, warm 
night she did what she could to sep- 
arate the pros and cons, the risks 
and the benefits, and however she 



INVERTED WORLD 



153 




looked at it her chosen course of 
action seemed to be the only one. 

S he rose early and went down to 
Maria’s house. She had to be 
quick — the men had said they 
would be coming soon after sunrise. 

Maria was awake — her baby was 
crying. She knew of the decision 
taken the night before and she 
questioned Elizabeth about it. 

“We’ll talk about it some other 
time,” Elizabeth said. “Right now 
I want to trade clothes with you.” 
“But yours are so beautiful — ” 

“I want something of yours — to 
play a joke on a friend. Anything 
will do.” 

Maria found a selection of rough 
garments and laid them out for 
Elizabeth’s inspection. They were 
worn and probably had never seen 
soap and water. For Elizabeth’s 
purpose they were ideal. She select- 
ed a ragged, loose-fitting skirt and 
an off-white shirt that had presum- 
ably once belonged to one of the 
men. She slipped out of her own 
clothes and pulled on Maria’s. 

Maria said, ‘‘But you look no 
better than a village girl — ” 

“Right.” Elizabeth examined the 
crying baby, found nothing wrong 
with it beyond a touch of colic. She 
went over with Maria the daily rou- 
tine she should follow to keep the 
infant comfortable. Maria, as al- 
ways, pretended to listen, although 
she would forget everything as soon 
as she was left alone. Had she not 
reared three children already? 

Walking barefoot up the dusty 
street, Elizabeth wondered if she 
truly would pass for one of the vil- 
lage women. She shook her hair 



into disarray — it was long and 
brown and she was deeply tanned. 
She tried to modify her posture as 
she walked to conceal the fact that 
she looked — and was — better fed 
than the village women. 

A small group of people already 
waited in the square in front of the 
church and more were arriving by 
the minute. Luiz was at the center 
of everything, trying to persuade 
some women who were simply 
watching to return to their homes. 
Beside him stood several girls — the 
youngest and the most attractive 
adult females in the village, Eliza- 
beth realized with a feeling of dis- 
gust. By the time she reached the 
group she counted ten of them. 

Luiz recognized her at once. 

“Menina Khan — ” 

“Luiz, who is the youngest of 
these?” 

He seemed reluctant to answer, 
so she picked out one she knew to 
be no older than fourteen. 

“Lea,” she said, “go back to 
your mother. I will go instead.” 

Unsurprised and uncomplaining, 
the girl walked mutely away. Luiz 
stared at Elizabeth for a moment, 
then shrugged. 

The wait was not long. In a few 
minutes three men appeared, each 
riding a horse and each leading an- 
other. All six horses were laden 
with packages and without cere- 
mony the riders dismounted and 
unloaded the materials they had 
brought. 

Luiz watched keenly. Elizabeth 
heard one of the men say to him, 
“We’ll be back in two days with the 
rest. Do you want the work done on 
the church?” 



154 



GALAXY 




“No — we do not need that.” 

“As you wish. Do you want to 
change any of the terms of the 
barter?” 

“No. We are satisfied.” 
“Good.” The stranger turned 
and faced the rest of the people who 
were watching the transaction. He 
spoke to them as he had spoken to 
Luiz, in their own language, but 
with a heavy accent. “We have 
tried to be men of good will and 
good word. Some of you may not be 
in favor of the terms we have pro- 
posed, but we ask your understand- 
ing. The women you have let us 
borrow will be cared for and will 
not be treated badly in any way. 
Their health and happiness are in 
our interests as much as yours. We 
shall see that they return to you as 
soon as possible. Thank you." 

The ceremony was over. The men 
offered the horses to the women to 
ride. Two of the girls climbed onto 
one horse, and five more took a 
horse each. Elizabeth and the two 
others elected to walk and soon the 
small party left the village. 

T hroughout the journey Eliza- 
beth maintained silence. The 
three men spoke to each other in 
English, assuming that none of the 
girls would be able to understand 
them. Elizabeth listened intently, 
hoping to learn something of 
interest, but mostly she heard com- 
plaints about the heat, the lack of 
shade and how long the journey 
would take. 

The men’s concern for the 
women seemed genuine enough. 
Every hour or so brought a rest stop 
and the women were given turns 



riding the horses. None of the men 
rode for any part of the way and in 
time Elizabeth began to sympathize 
with their complaints. If their des- 
tination was, as H el ward had said, 
twenty-five miles away, it was a 
long walk on a hot day. 

Later in the day the men’s inhi- 
bitions seemed to relax, perhaps as 
fatigue reached them. 

One asked, “Do you think all 
this is still necessary?” 

“The barters?” 

“Yes — I mean, they’ve caused 
trouble in the past.” 

“What would you suggest we do 
instead?” 

“I don’t know. Not my decision. 
If I had my way I wouldn’t be out 
here now.” 

“This time still makes sense to 
me. The last women haven’t moved 
out yet and there’s no sign of their 
doing so. Maybe we won't have to 
barter any more." 

“We will.” 

“You sound as if you don’t ap- 
prove.” 

“Frankly, I don’t. Sometimes I 
think the whole system’s crazy.” 

“You’ve been listening to the 
Terminators.” 

“Maybe I have. If you listen to 
them they make a bit of sense. Not 
that they have all the answers, but 
they’re not as bad as the Navigators 
make out.” 

“You’re out of your mind.” 

“Okay. Who wouldn’t be in this 
heat?” 

“You’d better not repeat what 
you just said in the city." 

“Why not? Enough people are 
saying it already.” 

“Not guildsmen. You’ve been 



INVERTED WORLD 



155 




down past. You know what’s 
what.” 

“I’m just being realistic. You’ve 
got to listen to people’s opinions. 
There are more people in the city 
who want to stop than there are 
guildsmen. That’s all.” 

“Shut up, Norris,” said the man 
who had so far not spoken, the one 
who had addressed the crowd in the 
village. 

The men’s conversation, what 
there was of it, returned to the im- 
mediacies. 

T he city had been in sight for 
some time before Elizabeth re- 
cognized it for what it was. As they 
came nearer she looked at it with 
great interest, not comprehending 
the system of tracks and cables that 
stretched away from it. Her first as- 
sumption was that it was some kind 
of marshaling yard, but she saw no 
sign of any rolling stock and any- 
way the length of track was too 
short for any practical use. 

Later she noticed several men ap- 
parently patrolling the tracks. Each 
carried either a rifle or what ap- 
peared to be a crossbow. More than 
this she could not absorb, since 
most of her attention was on the 
structure itself. 

She had heard the men refer to it 
as a city — as had Helward — but to 
her eyes it was not much more than 
a large and misshapen office block. 
Constructed mainly of timber, it 
had the ugliness of functionalism 
and yet there was a simplicity to its 
design she found not altogether un- 
attractive. She was reminded of 
pictures she had seen of pre-Crash 
buildings, and although most of 



those had been steel and reinforced 
concrete they shared the square- 
ness, the plainness and lack of ex- 
terior decoration. Those old build- 
ings had been tall, though, and this 
strange structure was at no point 
more than seven stories high. The 
timber showed varying stages of 
weathering. Most of what she could 
see had been well bleached by the 
elements, but newer construction 
was visible. 

The women were led into a dark 
passageway at the base of the build- 
ing. Here they dismounted and 
were taken up a staircase and 
through a doorway. They emerged 
into a brightly lit corridor. 

At the end of it was another door 
and here their escorts left them. A 
printed sign on the door read: 

TRANSFER QUARTERS. 

Inside they were greeted by two 
women, who spoke to them in the 
badly accented language of the 
people. 



O nce Elizabeth had adopted 
her pose she could find no way 
of abandoning it. In the next few 
days she was subjected to a series of 
examinations and treatments 
which, had she not suspected the 
reason, she would have found hu- 
miliating. She was bathed and her 
hair was washed. She was medically 
examined — her eyes were tested, 
her teeth checked. Her hair and 
scalp were inspected for infestation 
and she was given a test she could 
only imagine was to determine 
whether or not she had VD. 

Without surprise, the women 
supervising the examination passed 



156 



GALAXY 




her with a clean bill of health and 
she was then given over to two more 
women who began to instruct her in 
the rudiments of English. In spite 
of her best efforts to delay the 
learning process until she could dis- 
cover more than she had already 
guessed about what was in store for 
her, she was soon considered fit 
and educated enough to be released 
from this initial period of habilita- 
tion. 

The first few nights she had slept 
in a communal dormitory in the 
transfer center, but now she was 
given a tiny room of her own. This 
was scrupulously clean and fur- 
nished minimally. It contained a 
narrow bed, a space to hang her 
clothes — she had been given two 
identical sets of clothes to wear — a 
chair and about four square feet of 
floor space. 

Eight days had passed since her 
arrival and Elizabeth was begin- 
ning to wonder what she had hoped 
to achieve. She was assigned to the 
kitchens, where the work she was 
given was straightforward drud- 
gery. The evenings were free, but 
she was told that she was expected 
to spend at least an hour or two in a 
certain reception room where, she 
was told, she was supposed to mix 
socially with the people she met 
there. 

This room had a small bar at one 
end offering a limited choice of bev- 
erages. Entertainment was pro- 
vided by an ancient video set. 
When she switched it on a tape de- 
vice attached to it showed a comedy 
program that she failed to appre- 
ciate, although an invisible audi- 
ence laughed all the way through. 



The comic allusions were evidently 
contemporary to some earlier 
period and fairly meaningless to 
her. She watched the program 
through and from a copyright 
notice at the end learned that it 
had been taped in 1985. More than 
two hundred years ago. 

She met only a few people here. 
A woman from the transfer center 
tended the bar. A few men came in 
occasionally — dressed, as Helward 
had been, in the dark uniform — 
and sometimes two or three women 
who, like herself, were from outside 
the city. 



O ne day, working in the kit- 
chen, she accidentally solved a 
problem that had continued to nag 
at her. 

She was stacking away clean 
crockery when something about the 
metal cupboard caught her atten- 
tion. It had been changed almost 
out of recognition — its components 
had been removed and it had been' 
fitted with wooden shelves — but the 
IBM lettering on one of the doors 
still showed through the covering 
layer of paint. 

When she could seize the oppor- 
tunity she explored the rest of the 
city. Her movements were not re- 
stricted beyond the hours required 
by the performance of her duties. 
She talked to people, she learned, 
she thought. 

One day she came across a small 
room set aside for use by the resi- 
dents of the city during leisure mo- 
ments. Lying on a table she found a 
few sheets of printed paper, neatly 
stapled together. She glanced at 



INVERTED WORLD 



157 




them without much interest, saw 
the title on the first page: Des- 
taine's Directive. 

Later, as she walked through the 
city she saw many more of these 
printed sheets and in due time, her 
curiosity piqued, she read one set 
through. Ffaving seen its contents, 
she immediately concealed a copy 
in the bedclothes of her bunk, 
meaning to take it with her when 
she left. 

She was beginning to under- 
stand. She returned again to 
Destaine, read his words so often 
they became almost photographi- 
cally recorded on her brain. She 
thought about Helward and his ap- 
parently wild behavior and words. 

She tried to remember what he 
had said and in time, a kind of 
logical pattern appeared. 

The hypothesis by which the city 
and its people existed was that the 
world on which they lived was 
somehow inverted. Not only the 
world, but all the physical objects 
in the universe in which that world 
was presumed to exist. The shape 
that Destaine drew — a solid world, 
curved north and south in the 
shape of hyperbolae — was the ap- 
proximation they used. And it cor- 
related indeed with the strange 
shape that Helward had drawn to 
depict the sun. 

One day Elizabeth saw the flaw, 
as she walked through one of the 
parts of the city presently being re- 
built. 

She glanced up at the sun, 
shielding her «yes with her hand. 
The sun was as she had ever known 
it — a brilliant white ball of light 
high in the sky. 



XXXI11 

E lizabeth planned to leave the 
city the following morning — 
she would steal a horse and ride 
back to the village. From there she 
could get back to headquarters and 
take some leave shortly due to her. 
Four weeks would give her plenty of 
time to get back to England and 
check out what she thought she had 
discovered. 

She spent the rest of the day 
following routine and in the evening 
went to the reception room. And 
the First man she saw when she 
walked through the doorway was 
Helward. 

“Hello, Helward,” she said 
quietly. 

He turned to acknowledge her, 
then looked at her in disbelief. 

“You?” he said. "What are you 
doing here?" 

“Don't give me away — I’m not 
supposed to be able to speak Eng- 
lish very well,” she whispered. “I’m 
one of your transferred women.” 
She led him out of easy earshot of 
others in the room. “Look,” she 
said. “I'm sorry about the last time 
we met. I understand better now.” 
“And I’m sorry if I frightened 
you.” 

“Have you said anything about 
me to anyone here?” 

“About your being from Earth? 
No.” 

"Good, then don’t.” 

He asked, “Are you really from 
Earth planet?" 

“Yes. but I wish you wouldn-’t 
phrase it like that. I’m from 
Earth — and so are you. There’s a 
misunderstanding.” 



156 



GALAXY 




“God — I’ve begun to see that.” 
He looked down at her from the 
nine-inch advantage he had in 
height. “You look different here — 
but what are you doing as a trans- 
fer?” 

“It was the only way I could 
think of getting into the city.” 

“I would have brought you.” He 
glanced around the room. “Have 
you paired up with any of the men 
yet?” 

"No.” 

“Don’t.” As he talked he kept 
looking over his shoulder. “Have 
you got a room to yourself? We 
could talk better.” 

“Yes. Shall we go?” 

She closed the door when they 
were in her cubicle. The walls were 
thin, but could afford privacy. She 
sat in the chair, Helward on the 
edge of the bed. 

“I’ve read Destaine,” she said. 
“It was fascinating. I’ve heard of 
him somewhere. Who was he?” 
“The founder of the city.” 

“Yes. I gathered that. But he 
was known for something else.” 
Helward looked blank. “Did 
what he write make any sense to 
you?” 

“A little. Enough for me to 
understand that he was lost — 
and — wrong.” 

“Wrong about what?” 

“The city and the danger it was 
in. He writes as if he and the others 
had somehow been transported to 
another world.” 

“That’s so.” 

Elizabeth shook her head. 
“You’ve never left Earth, Helward. 
As I sit here and talk to you now — 
we’re both on Earth.” 



H e shook his head. “You’re 
the one who’s wrong. I know 
you are. Destaine knew the true 
situation. We are on another 
world." 

Elizabeth said, “The other day 
you drew me with the sun behind 
me. You drew it like a hyperbola. Is 
that how you see it? You drew me 
too tall. Is that how you see me?” 
“That’s not how. I see the sun, 
that’s how it is. And it is how the 
world is. You I drew tall, because 
that’s how I saw you then. We were 
a long way north of the city. 
Now . It's too difficult to ex- 
plain. I could never make you 
understand.” 

“Try it.” 

“No.” 

“All right. Do you know how I 
see the sun? I see it as a sperical ob- 
ject of light — not as you do. I see 
myself as tall some miles ‘north’ — 
or what you call ‘north’ — of here 
as I am here. It’s a question of what 
we subjectively perceive. Your 
senses inform you otherwise — I 
don’t understand why, but Des- 
taine’s perception was wrong, too. 
It’s always been wrong.” 

“Liz, it’s more than perception. 
I’ve seen, felt, lived in this world. 
Whatever you say, it’s real to me. 
I’m not alone. Most of the people in 
the city carry the same knowledge. 
It started with Destaine because he 
was there at the beginning. We’ve 
survived here a long time simply 
because of that knowledge. It’s 
been at the root of everything and 
it’s kept us alive, because without it 
we would not keep the city 
moving.”’ 

Elizabeth started to say some- 



INVERTED WORLD 



159 




thing, but he carried on. “Liz, after 
I saw you the other day I needed 
time to think. I rode north, a long 
way north. I saw something there 
that is going to test the city’s 
capacity for survival as it has never 
been tested before. Meeting you 
was — I don’t 'know — more than I 
had expected. But it led indirectly 
to a much bigger thing.” 

“What is it?” 

“1 can’t tell you.” 

“Why not?” 

“I can’t tell anyone, except the 
Navigators. They’ve declared the 
information restricted for the mo- 
ment. It would be a bad time for 
the news to get out.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Have you heard of the Termin- 
ators?” 

“Yes, but I don’t know who or 
what they are.” 

“They’re a political group in the 
city. They’ve been trying to get the 
city to stop. If this news leaked out 
at this moment there’d be a lot of 
trouble. We’ve just survived a 
major crisis and the Navigators 
don’t want another.” 

Elizabeth stared at him without 
saying anything. She had suddenly 
seen herself in a new light. 

She was at an interface of two 
realities — one was hers, one was 
his. However close they came 
together there could be no contact 
between them. The why of it was 
something she still had to discover, 
but like the graph-line Destaine 
had drawn to approximate the re- 
ality he perceived, the nearer she 
came to him in one sense the 
farther she moved away in another. 
Somehow, she had drawn herself 



into this drama where one logic 
failed in the face of another and she 
knew she was incapable of dealing 
with it. 

Persuaded as she was by Hel- 
ward’s sincerity and the manifest 
existence of the city and its 
people — and further by the appar- 
ently strange concepts around 
which they had made their sur- 
vival — she could not eradicate from 
her mind the basic contradiction. 
The city and its people existed on 
Earth — the Earth she knew — and 
whatever she saw, whatever Hel- 
ward said, there was no way around 
this. Evidence to the contrary made 
no sense. 

But when the interface was chal- 
lenged there was an impasse. 



E lizabeth said, “I’m going to 
leave the city tomorrow.” 
“Come with me. I’m going north 
again.” 

“No. I’ve got to get back to the 
village.” 

“Is that the one where they bar- 
tered for the women?” 

"Yes.” 

“I’m going that way. We’ll ride 
together.” 

Another impasse: the village lay 
southwest of the city. She said 
nothing. 

He asked, “Why did you come to 
the city, Liz? You’re not one of the 
local women.” 

“I wanted to see you.” 

“Why?” 

"I don’t know. You frightened 
me, but I saw other men who seem- 
ed to be like you trading with the 
village people. I wanted to find out 



160 



GALAXY 




what was going on. Now I wish I 
hadn’t — because you still frighten 
me.” 

“I’m not raving at you again, am 
I?” 

She laughed — and realized it was 
for the first time since she came to 
the city. 

“No, of course not,” she said. 
“It’s more — I can’t say. Everything 
I take for granted is different here. 
There must be a reason — a real 
physical one. Some of this could be 
in the mind, but not all. We are on 
the same planet and its name is 
Earth — that I know. But the city — 
not even your city — can’t be the 
sole goal of all human existence. A 
million other things are important 
in our world, and survival is un- 
doubtedly a drive, but not the pri- 
mary one. I’ve been outside the 
city, Helward, a long way outside 
the city. Whatever else you may 
think, this place is not the center of 
the universe.” 

“It is,” he said. “Because if we 
ever stopped believing that we 
would all die.” 



L eaving the city presented Eliza- 
j beth with no problems. She 
went down to the stables with Hel- 
ward and another man, whom he 
introduced as Future Blayne. They 
collected three horses and rode in a 
direction Helward declared was 
north. Again she questioned his 
sense of direction — by her reckon- 
ing of the position of the sun the 
true direction was toward the 
southwest — but she made nothing 
of it. By this time she was so accus- 
tomed to his affronts to what she 



considered logic that she saw no 
point in disputing his — and the 
city’s — position. She was content to 
accept the ways of the city — even if 
she didn’t understand them — as 
long as they got her where she 
wanted to go. 

As they rode out Helward pointed 
out the great wheels on which the 
city was mounted and explained 
that the forward motion was so slow 
as to be almost undetectable. How- 
ever, he assured her, the city moved 
about one mile every ten days. 
Northward — or toward the south- 
west, whichever way she cared to 
think of it. 

The journey took two days. Hel- 
ward and Future Blayne talked a 
lot, although not much made sense 
to her. She felt that she had suffer- 
ed an overload of new information, 
and could absorb no more. 

On the evening of the first day 
they passed within a mile or so of 
her village and she told Helward 
she wanted to drop out. 

“No, come with us. You can go 
back later.” 

She said, “I want to go back to 
England. I think I can help you.” 

“You ought to see this first.” 

“What is it?” 

“We’re not sure,” said Blayne. 
“Helward thinks you might be able 
to tell us.” 

She argued a little longer, but in 
the end went with them. 

She thought it strange that she 
succumbed so readily. The inter- 
face remained a problem — yet she 
could identify with these people. 
The society within the city was 
curiously civilized in a countryside 
that had been wasted by anarchy 



INVERTED WORLD 



161 




for generations. Even in the few 
weeks she had been in the village 
the peasant outlook, the unques- 
tioning lethargy, the inability to 
cope with even the most minor of 
problems had sapped her will to 
meet the challenge of her work. 
But the people of Helward’s city 
were of a different order. Evidently 
they were some offshoot community 
that had somehow managed to pre- 
serve itself during the Crash and 
now lived on as if nothing had 
changed — except that they believed 
they had moved to another planet. 

She had by her own actions 
involved herself in the affairs of 
their community. The conse- 
quences of her abandoning the 
village would have to be faced 
later — she could justify her im- 
mediate absence by saying she 
wanted to know where the women 
were being taken — but she felt now 
that she must follow this through. 
Ultimately some official body would 
have to rehabilitate the people of 
the city, but until then she was on 
the spot. 



T ihey spent the night under can- 
vas. There were only two tents 
and the men gallantly offered her 
one of them for her own use — but 
before that they spent a long time 
talking. 

Helward had evidently told 
Blayne about her and how she dif- 
fered — as he saw her — from both 
the people of the city and the 
people of the villages. 

Blayne spoke directly to her be- 
fore she turned in — Helward stayed 
in the background. By and large 



Blayne affirmed what she had 
learned. He spoke of Destaine and 
his directive, of the city and its need 
to move forward — and he talked of 
the shape of the world. She had 
learned not to argue with the city 
outlook and she listened. 

When she eventually crawled 
into her sleeping bag she was ex- 
hausted from the long ride through 
the day, but sleep came slowly. The 
interface had hardened. But her 
understanding of the city people’s 
logic had been deepened. 

They lived, Blayne said, on a 
world where the laws of nature were 
not what they were on Earth. She 
was prepared to believe him — or 
rather, to believe that he was sin- 
cere. 

She had faith in the world that 
was. 

Whatever it was. 



E merging from woodland the 
trio encountered a region of 
coarse scrubland — there were no 
tracks here and progress was slow. 
A cool, steady wind was blowing. 

Gradually the vegetation gave 
way to a hard, tough grass growing 
in sandy soil. Neither of the men 
said anything. Helward in particu- 
lar stared ahead as he rode, letting 
his horse find its own route. 

Elizabeth saw that ahead of them 
the vegetation gave way altogether 
and, as they breasted a ridge of 
loose sand and gravel, only some 
bare and scattered dunes lay be- 
tween them and the beach. Her 
horse, which had already sensed 
the salt in the air, responded 
readily to the kick of her heels and 



162 



INVERTED WORLD 




broke into a canter. For a few 
heady minutes she exulted in the 
freedom and joy of galloping along 
a beach with the wind from the 
ocean filling her lungs. 

Helward and Blayne had ridden 
down to the beach behind her, and 
now stood close together by their 
horses, looking out across the 
water. 

She trotted her horse over to 
them, and dismounted. 

“Does it extend east and west?” 
said Blayne. 

“As far as 1 explored. There’s no 
way around I could see.” 

Blayne took a camera from one 
of his packs, connected it to its case 
and panned it slowly across the 
view. 

“We’ll have to survey east and 
west,” he said. “The water would 
be impossible to cross at this 
point.” 

“There’s no sign of an opposite 
bank.” 

Blayne frowned at the beach. "I 
don’t like the soil. We’ll have to get 
the bridge people here. I don’t 
think this sand would take the 
weight of the city.” 

“There must be some way.” 

The two men entirely ignored 
her. Helward erected a small in- 
strument, a tripodal device with a 
concentric chart suspended by 
three catches below the fulcrum. 
He hung a plumbline over the 
chart, and took some kind of read- 
ing from it. 

“We’re a long way from opti- 
mum,” he said eventually. “We’ve 
got plenty of time. Thirty miles — 
almost a year of city time. Do you 
think it could be done?” 



“A bridge? It would take some 
doing. We’d need more men than 
we’ve got at the moment. What did 
the Navigators say?” 

“Check what I reported. Do you 
check?” 

“Yes. I can't see that I can add 
anything.” 

Helward stared for a few seconds 
longer at the expanse of water, then 
seemed to remember Elizabeth. He 
turned to her. 

“What do you say?” 

“About this? What do you 
expect me to say?” 

“Tell us about our perceptions,” 
said Helward. “Tell us there’s no 
river here.” 

She said, “It’s not a river.” 

Helward glanced at Blayne. 

“You heard her,” he said. 
“We’re imagining it.” 

Elizabeth closed her eyes, turned 
away. She could no longer confront 
the interface. 

The breeze was chilling her, so 
she took a blanket from her horse 
and moved back to the sandy ridge. 
When she faced the men again they 
were paying no attention to her. 
Helward had erected another in- 
strument and .was taking readings 
from it. He called them out to 
Blayne, his voice whipped thin by 
the wind. 

They worked slowly and pain- 
stakingly, each checking the other’s 
reading at every step. After an 
hour, Blayne packed some of the 
equipment on his horse, mounted 
and rode along the coast in a 
northerly direction. Helward stood 
and watched him go, his posture 
revealing a deep and overwhelming 
despair. 



GALAXY 



163 




Elizabeth interpreted it as a tiny 
weakness in the barrier that lay be- 
tween them. Clutching the blanket 
around her, she walked down 
across the dunes toward him. 

She asked, “Do you want to 
know where you are?” 

He didn’t turn. 

“No,” he said. “It doesn’t 
matter.” 

“Portugal. This country is called 
Portugal. It’s in Europe.” 

She moved around so that she 
could see his face. For a moment 
his gaze rested on her, but his ex- 
pression was blank. He shook his 
head and walked past her toward 
his horse. The barrier was absolute. 

Elizabeth went to her own ani- 
mal and mounted it. She walked it 
along the beach and soon moved in- 
land, heading back in the general 
direction of headquarters. In a few 
minutes the troubled blue of the 
Atlantic was out of sight. 



Book Five 

XXXIV 

T he storm raged all night and 
none of us got much sleep. Our 
camp was a half-mile from the 
bridge and as the waves came 
crashing in the sound reached us as 
a dull, muted roar, almost obliter- 
ated by the howling gale. In our 
imaginations, at least, we heard the 
splintering of timber in every tem- 
porary lull. 

Toward dawn the wind abated 
and we were able to sleep. Not for 
long, for soon after sunrise the 
kitchen was manned and we were 



given our food. No one talked as we 
ate. There could be only one topic 
of conversation and no one wished 
to speak of that. 

We set off toward the bridge. We 
had gone only fifty yards when 
someone pointed to a piece of 
broken timber lying washed up on 
the shore. It was a grim omen and, 
as it turned out, an accurate one. 
Nothing was left of the bridge 
beyond the four main piles that 
were planted in the solid ground 
near the water’s edge. 

I glanced at Lerouex who, for 
this shift, was in charge of all oper- 
ations. 

“We need more timber,” he 
said. “Barter Norris — take thirty 
men and start felling trees.” 

I waited for Norris’s reaction. Of 
all the guildsmen on the site he had 
been the most reluctant to work 
and had complained loudly and 
long during the early stages of the 
work. Now he showed no rebel- 
lion — we were all past that. He 
simply nodded to Lerouex, picked a 
body of men and headed back 
toward the camp to collect the tree- 
felling tools. 

“So we start again,” I said to 
Lerouex. 

“Of course.” 

“Will this one be strong 
enough?” 

“If we build it properly.” 

He turned away and started to 
organize the clearing up of the site. 
In the background the waves, still 
huge in the aftermath of the storm, 
crashed against the land. 

We worked all day and by eve- 
ning the site had been cleared and 
Norris and his men had hauled 



164 



GALAXY 




fourteen tree trunks to the spot. 
The next morning we could again 
start building. 

During the evening I sought out 
Lerouex. He was sitting alone in his 
tent, apparently checking through 
his designs of the bridge but in fact 
his stare was vacant. 

He did not seem pleased to see 
me, but he and I were the two 
senior men on the site and he knew 
1 would not have come without pur- 
pose. We were now of roughly 
equal age — by the nature of my 
work in the north I had passed 
many subjective years. It was a 
matter of some discomfort between 
us that he was the father of my 
former wife and that we were now 
contemporaries. Neither of us had 
ever referred directly to the matter. 
Victoria herself was still only a 
comparatively few miles older than 
she had been when we were married 
and the gulf between us was now so 
wide that even the memories we 
shared had become totally irretriev- 
able. 

“I know what you’ve come to 
say,” he said. “You’re going to tell 
me that we. can never build a 
bridge.” 

“It’s going to be difficult,” I 
said. 

“Impossible is what you mean.” 

“What do you think?” 

“I’m supposed to build bridges, 
Helward, not think.” 

“That’s crap and you know it.” 

“All right. But when a bridge is 
needed, I build it. I don't ask ques- 
tions.” 

I said, “You’ve always had an 
opposite bank.” 

“That makes no difference. We 



can build with pontoons.” 

“And when we’re mid-river, 
where do we get the timber? Where 
do we plant the cable stays?” I sat 
down to face him, unbidden. "You 
guessed wrong, incidentally. I 
didn’t come to tell you the job was 
impossible.” 

“Well?” 

“The opposite bank,’’ I said. 
“Where is it?” 

“Out there somewhere.” 
“Where?” 

“1 don’t know.” 

“How do you know there is 
one?” 

“There must be.” 

“We still have to know where 
we’re aiming,” I said. “We’re strik- 
ing away from this shore a few de- 
grees from perpendicular, but even 
so we should know where we expect 
to rejoin land. The curvature — ” 
“Is concave. I know. Don’t you 
think I haven’t thought about that? 
In theory we can see for ever. What 
about atmospheric haze? Twenty or 
thirty miles is all we can see with 
any accuracy even on a clear day.” 
“You’re going to build a bridge 
thirty miles long?” 

“I don’t think we’ll have to,” he 
said. “I think we’re going to be 
okay. Why else do you think I 
persevere?” 

I shook my head. ‘Tve no idea.” 
He said, “Did you know they’re 
going to make me a Navigator? The 
last time I was in the city we had a 
long conference. The general feel- 
ing is that the water might not be as 
wide as it appears. Remember, 
north of optimum dimensions are 
distorted linearly north and south. 
It’s obvious that this is a major 



INVERTED WORLD 



165 




crossing but reason demands that 
there’s an opposite shore. The 
Navigators think that when the 
movement of the ground takes the 
crossing as far as optimum we 
should be able to see the opposite 
bank. Granted, it might then still 
be too wide to oross safely — but all 
we need to do is continue waiting. 
The farther south the ground takes 
us the narrower the river will 
become. A bridge will eventually be 
feasible.” 

“That’s a hell of a risk,” I said. 
‘The centrifugal force could tear 
the city apart.” 

“I know." 

“And what if the opposite bank 
doesn’t appear before that?” 
“Helward, it has to.” 

“You know that there’s an alter- 
native.” I said. 

“I’ve heard what the men have 
been saying. We can abandon the 
city and build a ship. I could never 
approve that.” 

“Guild pride?” 

“No.” His face reddened. “Prac- 
ticalities. We couldn’t build one 
large enough or safe enough.” 
“We’re having the same diffi- 
culty with the bridge.” 

‘‘I know — but we understand 
bridges. Who in the city would 
know how to design a ship? 
Anyway, we’re learning by our mis- 
takes. We just have to keep build- 
ing until the bridge is strong 
enough.” 

“And time’s running out.” 

“How far north of optimum are 

we?” 

“Less than twelve miles.” 
“That’s a hundred and twenty 
days of city time,” he said. “How 



long do we have up here?” 

“Subjectively about twice that.” 
“That's plenty.” 

I stood up, headed for the tent 
flap. I was unconvinced. 

“By the way,” I said. “Congratu- 
lations on becoming a Navigator.” 
“Thanks. They’ve put your name 
forward, too." 



A few days later Lerouex and I 
L were relieved by the new shift 
and we set off for the city. The 
repaired bridge was well under way 
and the mood at the site was opti- 
mistic. We now had ten yards of 
platform ready for the track-layers. 

The horses were in use with the 
tree-felling crews, so Lerouex and I 
had to walk. Inland from the water 
the wind dropped and the temp- 
erature rose. We had both found it 
easy to forget how hot the land was. 

After we had walked some dis- 
tance I asked Lerouex, ‘‘How’s 
Victoria?” 

"She’s well." 

“I don’t see her very often now.” 
"Neither do I.” 

I decided to say no more. Vic- 
toria was clearly an embarrassment 
to him. In the last few miles the 
news about our latest crossing 
hazard had inevitably leaked to the 
people as a whole and the Termi- 
nators — of whom Victoria was now 
a leading figure — had emerged as a 
vociferously critical faction. They 
claimed that they had eighty per 
cent of the non-guildsmen on their 
side and that the city should now be 
halted. I had been unable to attend 
Navigators’ Council meetings re- 
cently, but I gathered that they 



166 



GALAXY 




were preoccupied with this prob- 
lem. In another break with their 
former traditions they had started a 
second campaign to educate the 
non-guildsmen of the true nature of 
the world, but the essentially ob- 
scure and abstract explanations did 
not have the simple emotional 
appeal of the Terminators. 

The Terminators had already 
scored one psychological victory. 
With the concentration of man- 
power on the building of the 
bridge, the work of track-laying 
had been left to one crew only and, 
although it was still under contin- 
uous propulsion, the city had been 
forced to slow down and was now a 
half-mile behind optimum. The 
militia had foiled an attempt by the 
Terminators to cut the cables, but 
not much was made of this. The 
real danger, fully appreciated by 
the Navigators, was the erosion of 
traditional political power within 
the city. 

Victoria, and presumably the 
other overt Terminators, still 
carried out nominal tasks on behalf 
of the city, but perhaps it was a sign 
of their influence that many of the 
routines of the city were falling 
behind. Officially the Navigators 
put this down to the redeployment 
of so many men to the bridge, but 
few were in doubt as to the real 
causes. 

Within guild circles resolution 
remained nearly unanimous. There 
was much complaining and some 
dissent with decisions, but in 
general there was a complete agree- 
ment that the bridge must be built. 
Halting the city would be unthink- 
able. 



“Are you going to accept the 
duties of Navigator?” I asked 
Lerouex, 

“I think so. I don’t want to 
retire, but — ” 

“Retire? There’s no question of 
that.” 

“Becoming a Navigator means 
retirement from active guild work,” 
he said. “The Council believes that 
by bringing in men who have been 
playing an active role outside it will 
acquire a more forceful voice. 
That, incidentally, is why they want 
you on the Council." 

“My work's up north,” I said. 

“So is mine. But we reach an 
age—” 

“You shouldn’t think of retir- 
ing,” I said. “You’re the best 
bridge man in the city.” 

“So they say. No one has the 
tactlessness to point out that my 
last three bridges have been unsuc- 
cessful.” 

“You mean the ones that were 
damaged at this present crossing?” 

“Yes. And the new one will go as 
soon as there’s another storm.” 

“You said yourself — ” 

“Helward — I’m not the man to 
build that bridge. It needs young 
blood. A new approach. Perhaps a 
ship is the answer.” 

Lerouex and I both understood 
what that admission meant to him. 
The Bridge-Builders guild was the 
proudest in the city. No bridge had 
ever failed. 

We walked on. 



almost as soon as I arrived in the 
city I was fretting to return to 
the north. I did not like the present 



INVERTED WORLD 



167 




atmosphere — it was as if the people 
had replaced the old system of 
guild suppression with a self-inflict- 
ed blindness to reality. Terminator 
slogans were everywhere and crude- 
ly printed leaflets littered the 
corridors. People talked of the 
bridge and the^r spoke fearfully. 
Men returning from a workshift 
told of the failures, spoke of build- 
ing a bridge toward a shore that 
could not be seen. Rumors, pre- 
sumably originated by the Termi- 
nators, told of dozens of men being 
killed, of more took attacks. 

In the Futures’ room 1 was ap- 
proached by Clausewitz, who was 
himself now a Navigator. He pre- 
sented me with a formal letter from 
the Council of Navigators, naming 
a proposer (Clausewitz) and a sec- 
onder (McMahon) who requested 
me to join them. 

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I can’t ac- 
cept this.” 

“We need you, Helward. You’re 
one of our most experienced men.” 

“Maybe. I’m needed on the 
bridge.” 

“You could do better work 
here.” 

“I don’t think so.” 

Clausewitz took me aside and 
spoke confidentially. 

“The Council is setting up a 
working party to deal with the Ter- 
minators,” he said. “We want you 
on that.” 

“How can you deal with them? 
Suppress their voices?” 

“No . we’re going to have to 
compromise with them. They want 
to abandon the city for good. We’re 
going to meet them halfway — and 
abandon the bridge.” 



I stared at him incredulously. 

“I can’t be a party to that,” I 
said. 

“Instead we build a ship. Not a 
big one, not nearly as complex as 
the city. Just large enough to get us 
to the other side. Then we’ll rebuild 
the city.” 

I handed back the letter and 
turned away. 

“No,” I said. “That’s my final 
word.” 



XXXV 

I prepared to leave the city 
forthwith, determined to return 
to the north and carry out yet an- 
other survey of our problem. Other 
surveys had confirmed that a river 
was indeed what we were dealing 
with — the banks did not curve, so it 
was not a lake. Lakes may be 
circled, rivers have to be crossed. I 
remembered Lerouex’s one opti- 
mistic remark, that the opposite 
bank might come into view as the 
river neared optimum. I knew a 
desperate hope — if I could locate 
that opposite shore there could be 
no further argument against the 
bridge. 

I walked down through the city, 
realizing that by my words and in- 
tents I had made certain my ac- 
tions. I had committed myself to the 
bridge, even though I had alienated 
myself from the instrument of its 
construction: the Council. In a 
sense I was on my own, in spirit and 
in fact. If a compromise were 
planned with the Terminators, I 
would have to subscribe to it even- 
tually, but for the moment the 



168 



GALAXY 




bridge was my only tangible reality, 
however improbable. 

I remembered something Blayne 
had once said. He described the 
city as a fanatical society and 
I questioned this. He said that one 
definition pf a fanatic was a man 
who continued to struggle against 
odds when all hope was lost. The 
city had been struggling against 
odds since Destaine’s day — behind 
it lay seven thousand miles of re- 
corded history, no part of which 
had been easily won. It was 
impossible for mankind to survive 
in this environment, Blayne had 
said, yet the city continued to do so. 

Perhaps I had inherited that fa- 
naticism, for now I felt that only I 
maintained the city’s sense of sur- 
vival. For me, it was given sub- 
stance in the building of the bridge, 
however hopeless that task might 
seem. 

In one of the corridors I met Gel- 
man Jase. He was now many sub- 
jective miles younger than I, be- 
cause he had been north only infre- 
quently. 

“Where are you going?” he 
asked. 

“Up north. There’s nothing for 
me in the city at the moment.” 

“Aren’t you going to the meet- 
ing?" 

“Which meeting?” 

"The Terminators.” 

“Are you going?” 

My voice had obviously reflected 
the disapproval I felt, for he said 
defensively: “Yes. Why not? It’s 
the first time they’ve come into the 
open.” 

“Are you with them?” 

“No, but I want to hear what 



they say.” 

“And what if they persuade 
you?” 

“That’s not likely,” said Jase. 

“Then why go?” 

Jase asked, “Is your mind totally 
closed, Helward?” 

I opened my mouth to deny it — 
but said nothing. The fact was that 
my mind was closed. 

“Don’t you believe in another 
point of view?” Jase asked. 

“Yes. But there’s no debate on 
this bridge issue. They’re in the 
wrong and you know it as well as I 
do.” 

“Just because a man’s wrong 
doesn’t mean he's a fool.” 

I said, “Gelman, you’ve been 
down past. You know what hap- 
pens there. You know the city 
would be taken there by the move- 
ment of the ground. Surely there’s 
no question about what the city 
should do.” 

“I know. But they have the ear of 
a large percentage of the people. 
We should hear them out.” 

“They’re enemies of the city’s 
security.” 

“Okay — but to defeat an enemy 
one should know him. I’m going to 
the meeting because this is the first 
time their views are being publicly 
expressed. I want to know what I’m 
up against. If we’re going to go 
across that bridge, it’s going to be 
people like me who will see us 
across. If the Terminators have got 
an alternative, I want to hear it. If 
not, I want to know it.” 

“I’m going up north,” I said. 

Jase shook his head. We argued 
a while longer and then we went to 
the meeting.

T he work on rebuilding the 
creche had been abandoned 
some miles back. The damage had 
long since been cleared, leaving 
bare the broad metal base of the 
city, open on three sides to the 
countryside. At the northern side of 
this area, agaifist the bulk of the 
rest of the city, some reconstruction 
work had been done, and the 
timber facings afforded the speak- 
ers a suitable background and a 
slightly raised platform from which 
to address the crowd. 

As Jase and I came out of the 
last building and walked across the 
space a considerable number of 
people were already there. I was 
surprised at the size of the turn- 
out — the resident population of the 
city had been considerably depleted 
by the men drafted to work on the 
bridge, but at a rough estimate it 
seemed to me that at. least three or 
four hundred people were gathered 
around the platform. 

A speech was already in progress 
and the crowd was listening without 
much response. The main text of 
the speech — made by a man I 
recognized as one of the food-syn- 
thesists — was a description of the 
physical environment through 
which the city was currently 
passing. 

“ — the soil is rich and there is a 
good chance that we could grow our 
own crops. We have abundant 
water, both locally and to the north 
of us.” Laughter. “The climate is 
agreeable. The local people are not 
hostile, nor need we make them 

SO — M 

After a few minutes he stood 
down to a ripple of applause. With- 



out preamble the next speaker 
came forward — Victoria. 

“People of the city, we face an- 
other crisis brought upon us by the 
Council of Navigators. For thou- 
sands of miles we have been mak- 
ing our way across this land, 
indulging ourselves in all that is in- 
human to stay alive. Our way of 
staying alive has been to move for- 
ward, toward the north. Behind 
us — “she waved her hand to en- 
compass the broad stretch of 
countryside that lay beyond the 
southern edge of the platform — “is 
that period of our existence. Ahead 
of us they tell us there is a river. 
One we must cross to continue to 
ensure our survival. What is be- 
yond that river they do not tell us, 
because they do not know — ” 

Victoria spoke for a long time 
and I confess I was prejudiced 
against her from her first words. 
They sounded to me like cheap rhe- 
toric, but the crowd seemed to ap- 
preciate them. Perhaps I was not as 
indifferent as I supposed, for when 
she described the building of the 
bridge and threw in the accusation 
that many men had died, I started 
forward to protest. Jase caught my 
arm. 

“Helward — don’t.” 

“She’s talking rubbish,” I said, 
but already a few voices in the 
crowd shouted that she was merely 
spreading rumor. Victoria con- 
ceded the point neatly, but added 
that there was probably more going 
on at the bridge site than was 
generally known and this specula- 
tion was greeted with some ap- 
proval. 

Victoria brought her speech to 



170 



GALAXY 




an unexpected conclusion. 

“1 say that not onjy is this bridge 
unnecessary, but that it is also dan- 
gerous. In this I have an expert 
opinion. As many of you know, my 
father is Chief Guildsman of the 
Bridge-Builders. He is the man who 
designed the bridge. I ask you now 
to listen to what he has to say." 

‘‘God — she can’t do that,” I 
said. 

Jase said, “Lerouex’s not a Ter- 
minator.” 

"I know. But he’s lost faith.” 

Bridges Lerouex was already on 
the platform. He stood beside his 
daughter, waiting for the applause 
to die down. He did not look 
directly at the crowd, but stared at 
the floor. He looked tired, old and 
beaten. 

“Come on, Jase. I’m not going to 
watch him be humiliated.” 

Jase looked at me uncertainly. 
Lerouex was preparing to speak. 

I pushed forward through the 
crowd, wanting to be away before 
he said anything. I had learned to 
respect Lerouex and did not wish to 
be present in his moment of defeat. 

A few yards forward I stopped 
again. 

Standing behind Victoria and 
her father, I had recognized some- 
one else. For a moment I couldn’t 
place either the name or the face — 
then both came together. Elizabeth 
Khan. 

I was shocked to see her again. 
She had left many miles ago — at 
least eighteen, city time, many 
more in my own subjective time. 
After she had left I had tried to put 
her from my mind. 

Lerouex had started to address 



the crowd. He spoke softly and his 
words did not carry. 

I was staring at Elizabeth. I 
knew why she was there. She was 
going to speak after Lerouex had 
finished humiliating himself. I al- 
ready knew what she would say. 

I started toward the platform, 
but Jase caught my arm. 

“What are you doing?” he 
asked. 

“That girl," I said. “I know her. 
She’s from outside the city. We 
mustn’t let her speak.” 

People around us were telling us 
to be quiet. I struggled to release 
myself from Jase but he held me 
back. 

Suddenly there was a burst of ap- 
plause and I realized that Lerouex 
had finished. 

I said to Jase, “Look — you’ve got 
to help me. You don’t know who 
that girl is.” 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw 
Blayne coming toward us. 

“Helward — have you seen who’s 
here?” 

“Blayne, for God’s sake help 
me — ” 

I struggled again and Jase fought 
to hold me. Blayne moved quickly 
to take my other arm. Together 
they pulled me back and out of the 
crowd. 

“Listen, Helward,” said Jase. 
“Stay here and listen to her.” 

“I know what she’s going to 
say — ’’ 

“Then allow others to hear.” 

Victoria stepped forward to the 
edge of the platform. 

“People of the city, we have one 
more person to speak to you. She is 
not known to many of us, because 



INVERTED WORLD 



171 




she is not of our city. But what she 
has to say is of great importance 
and afterward there will no longer 
be any doubt in your minds as to 
what we must do.” 

She raised her hand and Eliza- 
beth stepped forward. 



E lizabeth spoke softly, but her 
voice carried clearly. 

“1 am a stranger to most of you 
here,” she said, “because I was not 
born as you were within the walls of 
the city. However, you and L are of 
one kind: we are human and we are 
of a planet called Earth. You have 
survived in this city for nearly two 
hundred years, or seven thousand 
miles by your way of measuring 
time. About you has been a world 
in anarchy and ruins. The people 
are ignorant, uneducated, stricken 
with poverty. But not all people of 
this world are in this state. 1 am 
from England, a country where we 
are beginning to reconstruct a kind 
of civilization. There are other 
countries, too, bigger and more 
powerful than England. So your 
stable and organized existence is 
not unique.” 

She paused, testing the reaction 
of the crowd so far. There was 
silence. 

“I came across your city by acci- 
dent and lived here for a while 
within your transfer section.” 
There was some surprised reaction 
to this. “I have talked with some of 
you and I know how you live. When 
I left the city I returned to England. 
I’ve spent nearly six months there, 
trying to learn to understand your 
city and its history. I know much 



more now than I did on my first 
visit.” 

She paused again. Somewhere in 
the crowd a man shouted: “Eng- 
land is on Earth!" 

Elizabeth did not respond. In- 
stead she said, “I have a question. 
Is there anyone here responsible for 
the city’s engines?” 

After a short silence Jase said, “I 
am a Traction guildsman.” 

Heads turned in our direction. 
“Then you can tell us what 
powers the engines.” 

“A nuclear reactor.” 

“Describe how the fuel is in- 
serted.” 

Jase released me and moved to 
one side. I felt Blayne’s hold on me 
loosen and I could have escaped 
him. But like everyone else’s, my 
attention had been caught by the 
curious questions. 

Jase said, “I don’t know. I have 
never seen it done.” 

“Then before you can stop your 
city, you must find out.” 



E lizabeth moved back and 
spoke quietly to Victoria. A 
moment later she came forward 
again. 

“Your reactor is no such thing. 
Unwittingly, the men you call your 
Traction guildsmen have been mis- 
leading you. The reactor is not 
functioning and has not done so for 
thousands of miles.” 

Blayne said to Jase, “Well?” 
“She’s talking nonsense.” 

"Do you know what fuels it?” 
“No,” said Jase quietly, although 
many of the people around us were 
listening. “Our guild believes that 



172 



GALAXY 




it will run indefinitely without at- 
tention.” 

“Your reactor is no such thing,” 
Elizabeth said again. 

I said, ‘‘Don’t listen to her. The 
fact that we have electricity — 
power — means the reactor is work- 
ing—" 

From the platform Elizabeth 
said, “Listen to me — ” and began 
to tell us about Destaine. I listened 
with the others. 

Francis Destaine was a physicist 
who had lived and worked in Bri- 
tain, on Earth planet. He had lived 
at a time when Earth had been 
running critically short of electrical 
energy. Elizabeth recited the rea- 
sons, which were essentially that 
fossil fuels were burned to provide 
heat, which was converted into 
energy. When the fuel deposits ran 
out there would be no more energy. 

Destaine, Elizabeth said, claim- 
ed to have devised a process where- 
by apparently unlimited amounts 
of energy could be produced with- 
out any kind of fuel. His work had 
been discredited by most scientists. 
In due course the energy derived 
from fossil fuels had run out and 
there had followed on Earth planet 
a long period now known as the 
Crash. It had brought to an end the 
advanced technological civilization 
that had dominated Earth. 

She said that the people on Earth 
were now beginning to rebuild and 
Destaine’s work was instrumental 
in this. His process as originally 
outlined had been crude and dan- 
gerous, but a later, more sophisti- 
cated development was manageable 
and successful. 

"What has this to do with halting 



the city?” someone shouted. 

Elizabeth said, “Listen.” 

-tvestaine, she said, had discov- 
I 9 ered a generator that created 
an artificial field of energy which in 
close proximity to another similar 
field caused a flow of electricity. 
His early critics had based their op- 
position on the fact that the dis- 
covery had no practical use as the 
two generators consumed more 
electricity than they produced. 

Destaine at first had been unable 
to obtain either financial or intel- 
lectual support for his work. Even 
when he claimed to have discovered 
a natural field — a translateration 
window, he called it — and could 
thus produce his effect without the 
need of a second generator, he was 
still ignored. 

He claimed that this natural win- 
dow of potential energy was moving 
slowly across the surface of the 
Earth, following a line Elizabeth 
described as the great circle. 

Destaine eventually had managed 
to raise enough money from private 
sponsors to build a mobile research 
station. With a large team of hired 
assistants he set off for the Kuan- 
tung province of southern China 
where, he claimed, the natural 
translateration window existed. 

Elizabeth said, “Destaine was 
never heard from again.” 

E lizabeth said that we were on 
Earth planet and had never left 
it — and that our perception of it 
was distorted by the translateration 
generator which, self-powering as 
long as it was running, continued to 
produce the field about us. 



INVERTED WORLD 



173 




She said that Destaine had ig- 
nored the side effects other scien- 
tists had warned him of — that the 
force field could permanently affect 
perception and might have genetic 
and hereditary effects. 

She said that the translateration 
window still existed on Earth and 
that many others had been found. 

She said that the window Des- 
taine had discovered in China was 
the one our own generator was still 
tapping. 

That following the great circle it 
had traveled through Asia, through 
Europe. 

That we were now at the edge of 
Europe and that before us lay an 
ocean several thousand miles wide. 

She said . and the people 
listened . 



E lizabeth finished speaking. 

Jase walked slowly through the 
crowd toward her. 

I headed back toward the en- 
trance to the rest of the city. I 
passed within a few feet of the plat- 
form and Elizabeth noticed me. 
She called out, “Helward — ” 

1 took no notice but pushed on 
through the crowd and into the in- 
terior of the city. I went down a 
flight of steps, walked through the 
passageway beneath the city and 
out again into daylight. 

I headed north, moving between 
the tracks and cables. 

XXXVI 

H alf an hour later I heard the 
sound of a horse and turned. 
Elizabeth caught up with me. 



“Where are you going?” she 
asked. 

“Back to the bridge.” 

“Don’t. There’s no need. The 
Traction guild has disconnected the 
generator.” 

I pointed up at the sun. “And 
that is now a sphere.” 

“Yes.” 

I walked on. 

E lizabeth repeated what she 
had said before. She pleaded 
with me to see reason. She said 
again and again that it was only my 
perception of the world that was 
distorted. 

1 kept my silence. 

She had not been down past. She 
had never been farther away from 
the city than a few miles north or 
south. She hadn’t been with me 
when I saw the realities of this 
world. 

Was it perception that changed 
the physical dimensions of Lucia, 
Rosario and Caterina? Our bodies 
had been locked in sexual em- 
brace — I knew the real effects of 
that perception. Was it the baby’s 
perception that had made it reject 
Rosario’s milk? Was it only my per- 
ception that caused the girls’ city- 
made clothes to tear as their bodies 
distorted inside them? 



W hy didn’t you tell me what 
you just said when you were 
in the city before?” 1 asked. 

“Because I didn’t know then. I 
had to go back to England. And 
you know something? No one in 
England cared. I tried to find some- 
one, anyone, who could be made to 



174 



GALAXY 




find some concern for you and your 
city — but no one was interested. 
There’s a lot going on in this 
world — big and exciting changes 
are taking place. No one cares 
about the city and its people.” 
“You came back,” I said. 

“1 had seen your city myself. I 
knew what you and the others were 
planning to do. 1 had to find out 
about Destaine — someone had to 
explain translateration to me. It’s a 
dull, everyday technology now, but 
I didn’t know how it worked.” 
“That’s self-evident,” I said. 
“What do you mean?” 

“If the generator’s off, as you 
say, then there’s no further prob- 
lem. I just have to keep looking at 
the sun and telling myself that it’s a 
sphere, whatever else it might look 
like.” 

“But it’s only your perception,” 
she said. 

“And I perceive that you are 
wrong. I know what I see.” 

“But you don’t.” 

A few minutes later a large crowd 
of men passed us, heading south 
toward the city. Most of them were 
carrying the possessions they had 
taken with them to the bridge site. 
Not one of them acknowledged us. 

I walked faster, trying to leave 
her behind. She followed, leading 
her horse by its harness. 



T he bridge site was deserted. I 
walked out on the bridge. Be- 
neath me the water was calm and 
clear, although waves still broke on 
the bank behind me. 

I turned and looked back. Eliza- 
beth was standing near the water’s 



edge, watching me. I stared at her 
for a few seconds, then reached 
down and took off my boots. I 
moved away from her, to the very 
end of the bridge. 

I looked at the sun. It was 
dipping down toward the north- 
eastern horizon. It was beautiful in 
its own way. A graceful, enigmatic 
shape, far more aesthetically satis- 
fying than a simple sphere. My only 
regret was that I had never been 
able to draw it successfully. 

I dove from the bridge head first. 
The water was cold, but not un- 
pleasantly so. As soon as I surfaced 
an incoming wave pushed me back 
against the nearest bridge piling 
and I kicked myself away from it. 
With strong, steady strokes I swam 
northward. 

I was curious to know if Eliza- 
beth was still watching, so I turned 
on my back and floated. She had 
moved away from the ridge and was 
now riding her horse slowly along 
the uneven surface of the bridge. 
When she reached the end she 
stopped. 

She sat in the saddle and looked 
in my direction. 

I continued to tread water, wait- 
ing to see if she would make any 
gesture toward me. The sun was 
bathing her in a rich yellow light, 
stark against the deep blue of the 
sky behind her. 

I turned, and looked toward the 
north. The sun was setting, and al- 
ready most of its broad disk was out 
of sight. I waited until its northern 
spire of light had slipped down be- 
low the horizon. As darkness fell I 
swam back through the surf to the 
beach. ★
