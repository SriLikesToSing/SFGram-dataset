XT' esterday (as this is written) 
■* our Mariner V spacecraft ac- 
complished its fly-by of the plan- 
et Venus and transmitted back to 
Earth a staggering quantity of 
data about pressures, tempera- 
tures, existence or non-existence 
of a magnetic field and so on. 
(The 34 hours of data transmis- 
sion is still going on at this mo- 
ment in real time, so you won’t 
find the results here. You’ve al- 
ready seen them in the daily 
newspapers anyway.) It was, all 
in all, quite a triumph for our 
spacemen — a flight of 350,000,- 
000 kilometers, taking almost a 
hundred and twenty-seven days, 
and arriving on target, on time 
and functional. 

It happens we were in the big 
auditorium in the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratories in Pasadena, Calif- 
ornia, when the fly-by occurred. 
(In this particular case the “we” 
is not purely editorial; present 
were three delegates from the 
science-fiction fraternity, Fritz 
Leiber and Larry Niven having 
joined your editor.) A large chart 
dominated the room, with a pro- 


jector showing the spacecraft’s 
flight as, moment by moment, 
the big scanning disks at Gold- 
stone reported its position. The 
beep-beep-w/ieep of the incom- 
ing transmissions from Mariner 
gave a pleasantly Things-to- 
Comish musical background, 
while Mariner Control broke in 
with periodic situation reports on 
course, distance and velocity. 
Present were several hundred 
luminaries of science like Krafft 
Ehricke, generally interested by- 
standers like ourselves and Leon- 
ard Nimoy (Star Trek’s Mr. 
Spock), and men who had ac- 
tually worked on Mariner and its 
sister projects and had a deep 
interest in its success. 

Time came. Mariner reached 
turn-on position, and all its sys- 
tems turned themselves on. Mar- 
iner entered the shadow of Venus; 
minutes passed; it exited the oc- 
cultation again, and the show was 
over. Everything had worked. 
And there was a genteel patter 
of applause, and a few rueful 
smiles . and everybody got up 
and went home.

What was wrong? 

It was just one of those things. 
That was on October 21st. On 
October 20th, the Russian space- 
craft, Venera IV, had actually 
made a soft landing on Venus. 
And our triumph had all at once 
turned out to be a sort of wist- 
ful, feckless, second-best loss. 


'T'hat’s the way it was reported 
A in the papers, and we must 
in all honesty say that that was 
how it looked to at least a large 
number of the people on the scene 
at JPL. 

Yet clearly that view is non- 
sense. Venera IV did one thing, 
Mariner V another; if there is any 
interaction at all between the 
two probes, it is all to the good 
— one can validate the other if 
they are right, let us know the 
dimensions of uncertainty if they 
are wrong. A hundred years from 
now, when our great-grandchild- 
ren come to study that curious 
phenomenon of medieval history 
called the Space Race, it is very 
unlikely that they’ll have to com- 
mit to memory the fact that the 
Russians preceded us by a day 
on this particular occasion. They 
may learn that in the month of 
October in the year 1967 human 
knowledge of the planet Venus 
was increased by two successful 
missions, one American and one 
Russian, but they surely will not 


care which one got there first. 
And neither should we. 

The reason we do is because 
of a built-in fallacy in our con- 
textual view. To us, the space 
race is what games theorists call 
a “zero-sum” game. In the matrix 
of the zero-game, every good 
thing that happens to one side 
is a bad thing for the other; there 
is no such thing as a Russian 
“gain” without an American 
“loss.” 

There really are, of course, 
such things as zero-sum games. 
Poker is one. If you win a dollar, 
and Sam wins $5, and the other 
player, Bill, loses $6, the sum of 
all winnings and losses at the end 
of the game is zero. The chips 
may shift around from player to 
player, but there are the same 
number of chips at the end of 
the game as there were at the 
beginning. 

But not all games are zero-sum 
games, and it is both pernicious 
and silly to view all contests as 
struggles in which some must win, 
others lose. “Losers” can gain, 
too. 

Consider foot-racing. It is true 
that in a race one man wins and 
the others lose; but it is also true 
that no “winner” ever would have 
broken the four-minute mile 
without help from at least one 
“loser” who set the pace for him 
and made it possible for him to 
go faster than any man had ever 

6 


gone before. Contests, you see, 
need not be only against the other 
players. They can be against 
brute nature, against the harsh 
environment of the universe; and 
victory can be measured against 
the timekeeper’s stopwatch or the 
total quantity of knowledge we 
humans — all we humans — have 
been able to wrest from nature. 


T Tnfortunately a lot of our most 
influential gamblers are 
hooked on playing the zero-sum 
game. It may be a crooked wheel, 
they say, but as far as they’re 
concerned it’s the only wheel in 
town, and it’s where they bet the 
bundle. 

Happens that the bundle is our 
own federal budget, and these 
particular gamblers are our elect- 
ed representatives. If there was 
a certain gloom at JPL yesterday 
it had a basis in well documented 
fact. 

We may not really have lost 
anything by having the Russians 
steal our thunder, but the budget- 
choppers will think we did — and 
practically speaking, that’s the 
Same thing when appropriations 
time rolls around. Vietnam, Big 
Science and the Great Society are 
all demanding enormous quanti- 
ties of funds at once, and the 
legislators are eagerly seeking 
places to swing the axe. They 
can’t do much about the cost of 
Vietnam. They don’t want to an- 


tagonize the votes the Great So- 
ciety carries with it. The only 
place they can see to cut is in the 
sort of activity represented by Big 
Science . and a clearcut loss 
to the Russians gives some of 
them the excuse they’ve been 
looking for to chop away. 

And yet . there’s a whole 
universe out there, you know. It’s 
ours for the taking, at least as far 
as we now know. And if we don’t 
yet at this moment know precise- 
ly what we want it for, we can 
be very sure that when we do 
find out what’s there for us — 
new raw materials, new knowl- 
edge, maybe even new friends — 
we’ll be completely unable to 
understand how we got along 
without it so long. 

Our only way there is through 
the crude and clumsy beginnings 
of Venera and Mariner; and if 
we and the Russians are both 
playing the space game, we can 
have the comfort of knowing that 
it’s a game that will pay off in 
the long run for both of us — 
and for all the rest of the human 
race, too. 

So — our congratulations both 
to the fine men in the Jet Propul- 
sion Laboratories and to their op- 
posite numbers in Russia on the 
events of October 20th-21st, 1967. 
The Russians won that encounter 
fair and square. 

And so did we.

T'hen Dave and Annie bought 
* * the Edsel they didn’t stop 
to wonder about things like gas 
consumption, wear-and-tear on 
the springs over the years, or 
anything else practical. Dave 
solemnly kicked both front tires, 
then walked around the back 
and saw the Dewey for President 
sticker and said immediately. 
“We’ll take it.” How could any- 
one resist? 

And even when they drove to 
England on their vacation and 
began to discover the inconveni- 
ences of a fifteen-year-old, nou- 
veau-classic car, they didn’t real- 
ly mind. After all, it was positive- 
ly - 


“Oh, wait!” said Annie. “Look, 
look!” 

They were passing a white 
clapboard church which stood 
comfortably under shaggy ever- 
greens softly lit by strings of yel- 
low lights. The gravel yard was 
full of cars, and there was a 
hand-drawn sign of a tree out 
front saying: 

CHARITY BAZAAR 
RUMMAGE SALE 
TONIGHT 

“Let’s stop,” Annie said. “They 
might have — anything.” 

“Right,” Dave said and turned 
into the parking area. “A left- 


68 


handed anything with a secret 
decoder on the back.” 

They got out of the car. Dave’s 
head was shaved smooth, and he 
wore bell-bottom trousers — they 
were the style in his circle. Annie 
had a decal on her right arm 
that said “Arm.” She had a decal 
on her left arm that said “An- 
other Arm.” She was wearing a 
multicolored net dress. That was 
style, too. 

Dave didn’t know what he was 
expecting inside, but then there 
it was, a treasure house of beauti- 
ful, wonderful junk, laid out on 
tables, hanging on racks, standing 
proud and free. Not like the pic- 
ture of Mussolini that hung in 
their living room at home — 
Mussolini with his arm lifted and 
a balloon saying, “I use deodor- 
ant. I’m not afraid.” That was 
just a gagged-up picture, but 
these were things, a gas in them- 
selves. 

Like, my God, there was an 
upright Atwater-Kent radio and 
a black china turtle fifteen inches 
long, and a jelly- bag cap with a 
red tassel, and a four-color map 
of Storyland. He called Annie 
over to look at that, and she 
laughed in delight, a kind of 
Debbie Reynolds giggle that she’d 
picked up during the Fifties Fes- 
tival at the New Yorker. The 
map’s frame needed painting, but 
he put it with the bear-paw 
snowshoes he’d found. Snowshoes 
THE PLANET SLUMMERS 


under Mussolini would look 
great. 

And suddenly there was a 
noise, and Dave turned, and an 
old woman was yanking this 
marvelous World War I uniform 
with the puttees and all out of 
Annie’s hands. It was small 
enough that Annie could have 
cut it down for herself with al- 
most no trouble. 

“You can’t have it,” the 
woman said and held it behind 
her. 

Annie just looked stunned. 

A man, seeing the fuss, started 
toward them. The woman saw 
him and immediately appealed 
to him. 

“Sheriff, they can’t have this. 
I don’t want it sold.” 

He looked tiredly at her and 
said, “What’s the matter, Helen? 
You threw it in for sale.” 

But the woman looked at An- 
nie and burst into tears and held 
the uniform all the tighter. Dave 
came up and took Annie’s arm, 
the one that said “Another Arm.” 
“That’s all right, Sheriff,” he 
said. “We don’t really want it.” 
Annie said, “But — ” 

Dave put pressure on her arm 
and turned her away. The woman 
was still crying, very softly, as if 
murmuring to herself. “We don’t 
really want it,” Dave said. “Let’s 
just take the things we’ve found 
and leave.” 

Annie looked at the old woman, 

69 


hesitated, then nodded. Dave 
gathered up their finds and took 
them to the cashier’s desk. 

Outside, back on the road, the 
night was clear and cool and 
moonless. Dave and Annie were 
subdued, wondering about the old 
woman. 

“What could she want with an 
old World War I uniform?” An- 
nie asked. “We could have — ” 

“I don’t know,” Dave said and 
switched on the radio. On came 
the Sturm and Drang’s dixie- 
rock version of Lili Marlene, and 
they forgot about the woman as 
they sang along, Dave whistling 
the kazoo part. 

Suddenly, unaccountably, the 
radio faded. The lights dimmed, 
too, which was odd, and the 
motor sputtered. And then every- 
thing went completely dead, 
motor, lights, radio. They con- 
tinued to roll down the road, and 
Dave’s eyes had to make an ad- 
justment to the dark. He touched 
the brakes, and they came to a 
silent halt. 

nphey got out, and Dave was 
about to lift the hood — 
uselessly, ritualistically, since he 
didn’t know anything about en- 
gines — when he saw the thing 
silently moving toward them 
across the sky. It looked like a 
fantastic cross between a World 
War I airplane and a basketball. 

It settled down beside the road, 
70 


and only then did Dave realize 
how big it was; its wings hung 
over the road, blocking the lane 
in front of them. 

On the front of the basketball 
was something that looked like 
an elevator shaft. A door at the 
bottom of it split in the middle 
and slid back on either side. 

“Dave . .?” said Annie. 

“I don’t believe it,” he said. 

He reached through the open 
window of the car and pulled out 
a snowshoe to defend himself and 
Annie. 

Then out of the door of the 
spaceship came rolling two dark 
furry balls about four feet in dia- 
meter. They rolled down the road 
toward the car. 

As they came closer, Dave 
could hear that the balls were 
laughing — ordinary, very hu- 
man, jolly laughter. But there 
was no sound. It was simply in 
his head, but nonetheless it got 
louder as they approached. 

The one on the left was saying, 
‘What a marvelous road! Im- 
agine, it needs a line to tell it 
where to go.” 

Dave said, “We’re friendly.” 

His voice cracked a little. 

The other ball said, “It voca- 
lizes! Oh, delightful! Beautiful! 

Say something else.” 

“Yes yes, keep vocalizing! Do 
you do it all the time, or is it j 
some sort of cultural thing?” 

“Cultural thing?” said Dave; 

GALAXY 


and he looked bewilderedly at 
Annie. She was staring open- 
mouthed at the creatures as they 
rolled toward them. She began to 
edge behind him. 

“Maybe they’re acultural,” said 
the first ball. “Primitive and un- 
spoiled! Oh, can you imagine? 
They’ll never believe us at 
home.” 

“I can hardly believe it myself, 
and I’m here!” said the other. 
The two balls had rolled right up 
to them, and they sat pulsating 
in front of them. 

“What do you want?” Dave 
asked, hefting the snowshoe and 
feeling mortified as he realized 
what a ridiculous weapon it was. 

“It still talks out loud,” said 
the first ball, and suddenly it 
rolled up against him and 
changed form, flowing around 
him. 

“Hey!” Dave said. He tried to 
struggle, but even though the 
creature’s touch felt light and 
fuzzy he couldn’t work himself 
loose. 

“Marvelous, marvelous!” said 
the ball. “It’s got so many 
angles!” 

“Damn it, let me go!” Dave 
said. He raised his snowshoe high 
and brought it down against the 
creature. The snowshoe gave a 
whangggg and rebounded. 

Both of the balls laughed in 
surprise, and the one holding 
Dave released him. It rolled 
THE PLANET SLUMMERS 


backward and then around in 
little circles, chuckling, “Beauti- 
ful, oh, beautiful! Do you think 
they can be trained to flop around 
like that on command?” 

“Dave, what are they?” Annie 
asked faintly, backing away. 

“The other one vocalizes too,” 
said the first ball. “It sounds dif- 
ferent, though. Which one do you 
like best?” 

“Oh, they’re both just wonder- 
ful! Couldn’t we take them both? 
Couldn’t we?” 

“Take us?” said Annie. “Oh, 
Dave . .” 

“Let’s try the other one,” said 
the first ball, and it shot forward 
before Annie could even turn to 
run and flowed around her. 

“Oh, this one’s bumpier! Much 
bumpier!” 

“Dave!” Annie screamed, 
struggling frantically against the 
creature, striking her fists awk- 
wardly against its round fur. 

“This one does it too! This one 
does it too!” 

Dave threw down the snow- 
shoe and attacked the creature 
with feet and hands. He kicked 
and felt his foot sink into soft 
fuzziness ; he pounded both fists 
into it, but it was like hitting 
dandelion fluff, like beating on 
air. But the creature flowed 
back into its ball-form and 
bounced up and down, chuck- 
ling. 

“They’re great! I’ve never seen 

71 


anything that’s quite like them!” 

“Oh, couldn’t we please take 
them both? A pair of them would 
be completely marvelous! Think 
of it!” 

“I know, but we don’t have 
enough room. If we found some- 
thing funnier somewhere, we’d 
just have to throw one out. No, 
we’ll have to choose just one of 
them.” 

“Annie!” said Dave. “Run for 
the car! Go on — get going!” 

“But — ” 

“ Run for it!” he said, and he 
threw himself bodily at the near- 
er of the two balls. 

He felt the impact when he hit, 
but it wasn’t solid. The creature 
seemed to flow around him like 
water — no, like spray, like fog 
— and as Dave rolled over to 
get to his feet he saw both crea- 
tures rolling pellmell after Annie, 
who was trying to make it to the 
car. He got up and ran after 
them, but they’d already caught 
Annie. 

“Dave, help me!” Annie was 
being carried toward the space- 
ship, and as Dave tried to get 
to her the second ball flowed 
around his feet, tripping him. 

“Dave!” Annie screamed. 

He tried to get up, but the 
second creature bounced up in 
front of him and settled on his 
head, flowing down over his face, 
blinding him. He heard giggling 
all around him. 

72 


“Oh, look, look! Are you sure 
we can’t take both?” 

“Only one. Come on; I have 
this one in the compartment.” 
The creature withdrew itself 
from Dave’s head. 

Neither Annie nor the first 
creature was visible. 

The second ball reached the 
open door well before Dave and 
bounced inside. The doors slid 
shut behind it. Dave slammed 
against solid metal, tried des- 
perately to pry the doors apart. 
He was crying, the tears running 
down his face. He was still trying 
to get his fingers into the door 
when the ship took off. 

T Te stared, panting and gasp- 
ing, as it soared away into 
the night sky. 

He stood silent and numb, not 
knowing what to do. Bob Harri- 
son had once had a bandicoot 
which he’d bought on impulse 
just because of the name. Even- 
tually it had died or Bob had 
gotten rid of it. Anyway, he didn’t 
have it any more. Dave wondered 
what would happen to Annie. 

The headlights of the car flick- 
ered on behind him, and he 
whirled, startled. In a few sec- 
onds the radio started to play, 
sounding out of place in the 
empty night. It was Society’s 
Children singing Inside-Out Ba- 
nana. — Terry Carr

incredibly long-lasting life ! , 


'Tpwo things will last to the end 
of time, at least for the tribes 
of Western Man, no matter how 
far his spaceships rove. They are 
sorcery and romantic love, which 
come to much the same thing in 
the end. 

For the more that becomes pos- 
sible to man, the more wildly he 
yearns for the impossible, and 
runs after witches and sorcerers 
to find it. 

While the farther he travels, 
to the star-ribboned rim of the 
Milky Way and beyond, the more 
he falls in love with far-off things 
and yearns for the most distant 
and unattainable beloved. 

Also, witchcraft and sorcery are 
games it takes two to play; the 
witch or sorcerer and his or her 
client.

side the jewel-pillared spacefield 
of the most exclusive pleasure 
planet between the galaxy’s two 
dizzily-whirling, starry arms. The 
gypsy’s black cat, gliding past 
them back into the tent, only 
smiled cryptically. 

A private, eiderdown-surfaced 
slidewalk, rolled out like the red 
carpet of ancient cliche, received 
the begemmed slippers of the 
honeymooning couple and carried 
them toward the most diamond- 
glittering pillar of them all, the 
private hyperspace yacht Eros of 
the galactic shipping magnate 
Piliph Foelitsack and his dazzling 
young bride Annaoj.

He looked 21 and was 20 times 
that old. Cosmetic surgery and 
organ replacements and implant- 
ed featherweight power-prosthe- 
tics and pacemakers had worked 
their minor miracles. At any one 
time there were three physicians 
in the Eros listening in on the 
functionings of his body. 

She looked and was 17, but the 
wisdom in her eyes was that of 
Eve, of Helen of Troy, of Cleo- 
patra, of Forzane. It was also 
the wisdom of Juliet, of Iseult, of 
Francesca da Rimini. It was a 
radiant but not a rational wis- 
dom, and it had a frightening in- 
gredient that had been known to 
make nurses and lady’s maids 
and the wives of planetary presi- 
dents and systemic emperors 
shiver alike. 

Together now on the whisper- 
ing white slidewalk, planning 
their next pleasures, they looked 
the pinnacle of cosmic romance 
fulfilled — he dashing and hand- 
some and young, except that 
there was something just a shade 
careful about the way he carried 
himself; she giddy and slim with 
a mind that was all sentimental 
or amorous whim, except for that 
diamond touch of terrifyingly fix- 
ed white light in her most melt- 
ing or mischievous glance. Des- 
pite or perhaps because of those 
two exceptions, they seemed 
more akin to the sparkling stars 
above them than even to the 


gorgeous pleasure planet around 
them. 

He had been born in a ghetto 
on Andvari III and had fought 
his way up the razor-ranged lad- 
der of economic power until he 
owned fleets of hyperspace 
freighters, a dozen planets, and 
the governments of ten times that 
many. 

She had been born in a slum 
on Aphrodite IV, owning only 
herself. It had taken her six Ter- 
ran months to bring herself to 
the attention of Piliph Foelitsack 
by way of three beauty contests 
and one bit part in a stereograph- 
ic all-senses sex-film, and six 
more months to become his sev- 
enteenth wife instead of one more 
of his countless casual mistresses. 

nphe beepers of social gossip 
-®- everywhere had hinted dis- 
creetly about the infatuation-po- 
tential of fringe senile megabil- 
lionaires and the coldly murder- 
ous greed of teenage starlets. And 
Annaoj and Piliph Foelitsack had 
smiled at this gossip, since they 
knew they loved each other and 
why: for their matching merci- 
less determination to get what 
they wanted and keep it, and for 
the distance that had been be- 
tween them and was no longer. 
Of the two, Annaoj’s love was 
perhaps the greater, accounting 
for the icy, fanatic glint in her 
otherwise nymphet’s eyes.

GALAXY 


They had laughed on leaving 
the drab tent of the gypsy for- 
tuneteller, who herself owned a 
small, beat-up spaceship covered 
with cabalistic signs, because the 
last thing she had said to the 
Shipping king, fixing his bright 
youthful eyes with her bleared 
ones, had been, “Piliph Foeiit- 
sack, you have joumied far, very 
far, for such a young man, yet 
you shall make even longer jour- 
nies hereafter. Your past travels 
will be trifles compared to your 
travels to come.” 

Both Piliph and Annaoj knew 
that he had been once to the An- 
dromeda Galaxy and twice to 
both Magellanic Clouds, though 
they had not told the silly old 
gypsy so, being despite their iron 
wills kindly lovers, still enamored 
of everything in the cosmos by 
virtue of their mutual love. They 
also knew that Piliph had deter- 
mined to restrict his jaun tings 
henceforth to the Milky Way, to 
keep reasonably close to the 
greatest geriatric scientists, and 
they were both reconciled, at 
least by day, to the fact that des- 
pite all his defenses, death would 
come for him in ten or twenty 
years. 

Yet, although they did not now 
tell each other so, the gypsy’s 
words had given a spark of real 
hope to their silly night-promises 
under the stars like gems and the 
galaxies like puffs of powder 


that: “We will live and love for- 
ever.” Their loveliest night had 
been spent a hundred light-years 
outside the Milky Way — it was 
to be Piliph’s last extragalactic 
venture — where the Eros had 
emerged briefly from hyperspace 
and they had lolled and luxuriat- 
ed for hours under the magnify- 
ing crystal skylight of the Master 
Stateroom, watching only the far- 
off galaxies, with all of their 
moiling, toiling home-galaxy out 
of sight beneath the ship. 

But now, as if the cryptic uni- 
verse had determined to give an 
instant sardonic rejoinder to the 
gypsy’s prediction, the eiderdown 
slidewalk had not murmured 
them halfway to the Eros when 
a look of odd surprise came into 
Piliph’s bright youthful eyes and 
he clutched at his heart and 
swayed and would have toppled 
except that Annaoj caught him in 
her strong slender arms and held 
him to her tightly. 


Something had happened in the 
^ body of Piliph Foelitsack that 
could not be dealt with by all its 
pacemakers and its implanted 
and remotely controlled hormone 
dispensers, nor by any of the 
coded orders frantically tapped 
out by the three physicians mon- 
itoring its organs and systems. 

It took thirty seconds for the 
ambulance of the Eros to hurtle 
out from the yacht on a track 


CRAZY ANNAOJ 


75 


paralleling the slidewalk and 
brake to a bone-jolting silent halt. 

During that half minute An- 
naoj watched the wrinkles come 
out on her husband’s smooth 
face, like stars at nightfall in the 
sky of a planet in a star cluster. 
She wasted one second on the 
White-hot impulse to have the 
gypsy immediately strangled, but 
she knew that the great aristo- 
crats of the cosmos do not take 
vengeance on its vermin and that 
in any event she had far more 
pressing business with which to 
occupy herself fully tonight. She 
clasped the pulseless body a tri- 
fle more tightly, feeling the bones 
and prosthetics through the layer 
of slack flesh. 

In two minutes more, in the 
surgery of the Eros, Philiph’s 
body was in a dissipatory neu- 
trino field, which instantly sent 
all its heat packing off at the 
speed of light, but in particles 
billions of times slimmer than 
the photons of heat, so that the 
body was supercooled to the tem- 
perature of frozen helium with- 
out opportunity for a single dis- 
ruptive crystal to form. 

Then without consulting the 
spacefield dispatching station or 
any other authority of the pleas- 
ure planet, Annaoj ordered the 
Eros blasted into hyperspace and 
driven at force speed to the gal- 
axy’s foremost geiiatics clinic on 
Menbar V, though it lay half- 


way across the vast Milky Way. 

During the anxious, grueling 
trip, she did only one thing 
quite out of the ordinary. She 
had her husband’s supercooled 
body sprayed with a transparent 
insulatory film, Which would ad- 
equately hold its coolth for a 
matter of days, and placed in the 
Master Stateroom. Once a week 
the body was briefly returned to 
the dissipatory neutrino field, to 
bring its temperature down again 
to within a degree of zero Kelvin. 

Otherwise she behaved as she 
always had, changing costume 
seven times a day, paying great 
attention to her coiffure and to 
her cosmetic and juvenation 
treatments, being idly charming 
to the officers and stewards. 

But she spent hours in her 
husband’s office, studying his 
business and working to the edge 
of exhaustion his three secretar- 
ies. And she always took her 
small meals in the Master State- 
room. 

rvn Menkar V they told her, 
after weeks of test and study, 
that her husband was beyond re- 
awakening, at least at the pres- 
ent state of medical skill, and to 
come back in ten years. More 
would be known then. 

At that, Annaoj nodded frigid- 
ly and took up the reins of her 
husband’s business, conducting 
them entirely from the Eros as 


76 


GALAXY 


it skipped about through space 
and hyperspace. Under her guid- 
ance the Foelitsack economic 
empire prospered still more than 
it had under its founder. She suc- 
cessfully fought or bought off the 
claims of Piliph’s eleven sur- 
viving divorced wives, a hundred 
of his relatives and a score of 
his prime managers. 

She regularly returned to Men- 
kar V and frequently visited 
other clinics and sought out fam- 
ous healers. She became expert 
at distinguishing the charlatans 
from the dedicated, the conceited 
from the profound. Yet at times 
she also consulted sorcerers and 
wizards and witchdoctors. Incan- 
tations in exotic tongues and 
lights were spoken and glowed 
over Philiph’s frigid form, extra- 
terrestrial stenches filled the sur- 
gery of the Eros, and there were 
focused there the meditations of 
holy creatures which resembled 
man less than a spider does — 
while three or four fuming yet 
dutiful doctors of the Eros’ doz- 
en waited for the crucial mom- 
ent in the ceremony when they 
would obediently work a five- 
second reversal of the neutrino 
field to bring the body briefly 
to normal temperature to de- 
termine whether the magic had 
worked. 

But neither science nor sorcery 
could revive him. 

She bullied many a police 


force and paid many a detective 
agency to hunt down the gypsy 
with the black cat, but the old 
crone and her runic spaceship 
had vanished as utterly as the 
vital spark in Philiph Foelitsack. 
No one could tell whether Annaoj 
really believed that the gypsy 
had had something to do with 
the striking down of her husband 
and might be able to bring him 
alive, or whether the witch had 
merely become another counter 
in the sorcery game of which 
Annaoj had suddenly grown so 
fond. 

In the course of time Annaoj 
took many lovers. When she 
tired of one, she would lead him 
for the first time into the Master 
Stateroom of the Eros and show 
him the filmed and frosty body of 
her husband and send him away 
without as much as a parting 
touch of her fingertips and then 
lie down beside the cold, cold 
form under the cold, cold stars 
of the skylight. 

And she never once let an- 
other woman set foot in that 
room. 

Not the humblest, nor ugliest 
maid. Not the greatest sculptress 
of the Pleiades. Not the most 
feared and revered sorceress in 
the Hyades. 

She became known as Crazy 
Annaoj, though no one thought it 
to her face or whispered it with- 
in a parsec of her. 


CRAZY ANNAOJ 


77 


■\T7hen she still looked 17, 
’ ' though her age was 70 
times that — for the sciences 
of geriatrics and juvenation had 
progressed greatly since her hus- 
band’s collapse — she felt an un- 
familiar weariness creeping on 
her and she ordered the Eros to 
make once more for Menkar V 
at force speed. 

The Eros never emerged from 
hyperspace. Most say she was 
lost there, scuttled by Annaoj 
as she felt death coming on her. 
A few maintain she exited 
into altogether another universe, 


where Crazy Annaoj is still keep- 
ing up her search for the healer 
who can revive Piliph, or play- 
ing her game with the doctors 
and witchdoctors and with her 
lovers. 

But in any case the gypsy’s 
prediction was fulfilled, for in 
the course of Annaoj ’s voyages, 
the body of Piliph Foelitsack had 
been carried twice to Andromeda 
and also to two galaxies in Vir- 
go, three in Leo and one in 
Coma Berenices.

What a lovely city! It cared 
for every need — endlessly!

/^armody had never really 
^ planned to leave New York. 
Why he did so is inexplicable. A 
born urbanite, he had grown ac- 
customed to the minor incon- 
veniences of metropolitan life. 
His snug apartment on the 290th 
floor of Levitfrack Towers on 
West Ninety-Ninth Street was 
nicely equipped in the current 
“Spaceship” motif. The windows 
were double-sealed in tinted life- 
time plexiglass, and the air ducts 
worked through a blind baffle 
filtration system which sealed au- 
tomatically when the Com- 
bined Atmosphere Pollution In- 
dex reached 999.8 on the Con 


Ed scale. True, his oxygen-nitro- 
gen air recirculation system was 
old, but it was reliable. His water 
purification cells were obsolete 
and ineffective; but then, nobody 
drank water anyhow. 

Noise was a continual annoy- 
ance, unstoppable and inescap- 
able, But Carmody knew that 
there was no cure for this, since 
the ancient art of soundproofing 
had been lost. It was urban man’s 
lot to listen, a captive audience, 
to the arguments, music and 
watery gurglings of his adjacent 
neighbors. Even, this torture 
could be alleviated, however, by 
producing similar sounds of one’s 
own. 

Going to work each day en-

tailed certain dangers; but these 
were more apparent than real. 
Disadvantaged snipers continued 
to make their ineffectual protests 
from rooftops and occasionally 
succeeded in potting an unwary 
out-of-towner. But as a rule, their 
aim was abominable. Additional- 
ly, the general acceptance of 
lightweight personal armor had 
taken away most of their sting, 
and the sternly administered 
State law forbidding the personal 
possession of surplus cannon had 
rendered them ineffectual. 

Thus, no single factor can be 
adduced for Carmody’s sudden 
decision to leave what was gen- 
erally considered the world’s 
most exciting megapolitan agglo- 
meration. Blame it on a vagrant 
impulse, a pastoral fantasy, or 
on sheer, perversity] The simple, 
irreducible fact is, one day 
Carmody opened his copy of the 
Daily Times- News and saw an 
advertisement for a model city 
in New Jersey. 

“Come live in Bellwether, the 
city that cares,” the advertise- 
ment proclaimed. There follow- 
ed a list of utopian claims which 
need not 'be reproduced here. 

“Huh,” said Carmody, and 
read on. 

Bellwether was within easy 
commuting distance. One simply 
drove through the Ulysses S. 
Grant Tunnel at 43 rd Street, 
took the Hoboken Shunt Sub- 
80 


road to the Palisades Interstate 
Crossover, followed that for 3.2 
miles on the Blue-Cbarlie Sorter 
Loop that led onto U.S. 5 (The 
Hague Memorial Tollway), pro- 
ceeded along that a distance of 
6.1 miles to the Garden State 
Supplementary Access Service 
Road (Provisional) , upon which 
one tended west to Exit 1731 A, 
which was King’s Highbridge 
Gate Road, and then continued 
along that for a distance of 1.6 
miles. And there you were. 

“By jingo,” said Carmody, 
I’ll do it.” . 

And he did. 

II 

TT'ing’s Highbridge Gate Road 
* ^ ended on a neatly trimmed 
plain. Carmody got out of his 
car and looked around. Half a 
mile ahead of him he saw a 
small city. A single modest 
signpost identified it as Bell- 
wether . 

This city was not constructed 
in the traditional manner of 
American cities, with outliers of 
gas stations, tentacles of hot-dog 
stands, fringes of motels and a 
protective carapace of junkyards; 
but rather, as some Italian hill 
towns are fashioned, it rose 
abruptly, without physical pre- 
amble, the main body of the 
town presenting itself at once 
and without amelioration. 

GALAXY 


Carmody found this appealing. 
He advanced into the city itself. 

Bellwether had a warm and 
open look. Its streets were laid 
out generously, and there was a 
frankness about the wide bay 
windows of its store-fronts. As 
he penetrated deeper, Carmody 
found other delights. Just with- 
in the city he entered a piazza, 
like a Roman piazza, only smal- 
ler; and in the center of the 
piazza there was a fountain, and 
standing in the fountain was a 
marble representation of a boy 
with a dolphin, and from the dol- 
phin’s mouth a stream of clear 
water issued. 

“I do hope you like it,” a 
voice said from behind Car- 
mody’s left shoulder. 

“It’s nice,” Carmody said. 

“I constructed it and put it 
there myself,” the voice told him. 
“It seemed to me that a fountain, 
despite the antiquity of its con- 
cept, is esthetically functional. 
And this piazza, with its benches 
and shady chestnut trees, is 
copied from a Bolognese model. 
Again, I did not inhibit myself 
with the fear of seeming old- 
fashioned. The true artist uses 
What is necessary, be it a thou- 
sand years old or one second 
new.” 

“I applaud your sentiment,” 
Carmody said. “Permit me to in- 
troduce myself. I am Edward 
Carmody.” He turned, smiling. 
STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


But there was no one behind 
his left shoulder, or behind his 
right shoulder, either. There was 
no one in the piazza, nobody at 
all in sight. 

“Forgive me,” the voice said. 
“I didn’t mean to startle you. I 
thought you knew.” 

“Knew what?” Carmody asked. 
“Knew about me.” 

“Well, I don’t,” Carmody said. 
“Who are you and where are you 
speaking from?” 

“I am the voice of the city,” 
the voice said. “Or to put it an- 
other way, I am the city itself, 
Bellwether, the actual and verit- 
able city, speaking to you.” 

“Is that a fact?” Carmody 
said sardonically. “Yes,” he 
answered himself, “I suppose it 
is a fact. So all right, you’re a 
city. Big deal!” 

He turned away from the 
fountain and strolled across the 
piazza like a man who conversed 
with cities every day of his life, 
and who was slightly bored with 
the whole thing. He walked 
down various streets and up cer- 
tain avenues. He glanced into 
store windows and noted houses. 
He paused in front of statuary, 
but only briefly. 

“Well?” the city of Bellwether 
asked after a while. 

“Well what?” Carmody ans- 
wered at once. 

“What do you think of me?” 
“You’re okay,” Carmody said. 

81 





“Only okay? Is that all?” 
“Look,” Carmody said, “a city 
is a city. When you’ve seen one, 
you’ve pretty much seen them 
all.” 

“That’s untrue!” the city said, 
with some show of pique. “I am 
distinctly different from other 
cities. I am unique.” 

4 4 A re you indeed?” Carmody 
said scornfully. “To me 
you look like a conglomeration 
of badly assembled parts. You’ve 
got an Italian piazza, a couple 
of Greek-type buildings, a row 
of Tudor houses, an old-style 
New York tenement, a California 
hot-dog stand shaped like a tug- 
boat and God knows what else. 
What’s so unique about that?” 
“The combination of those 
forms into a meaningful entity is 
unique,” the city said. “These 
older forms are not anchronisms, 
you understand. They are rep- 
resentative styles of living, and 
as such are appropriate in a well 
wrought machine for living. 
Would you care for some coffee 
and perhaps a sandwich or some 
fresh fruit?”” 

“Coffee sounds good,” Carmo- 
dy said. He allowed Bellwether 
to guide him around the comer 
to an open-air cafe. The cafe 
was called O You Kid and was 
a replica of a Gay Nineties sa- 
loon, right down to the tiffany 
lamps and the cutglass chande- 
STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


lier and the player piano. Like 
everything else that Carmody 
had seen in the city, it was spot- 
lessly clean, but without people. 

“Nice atmosphere, don’t you 
think?” Bellwether asked. 

“Campy,” Carmody pronounc- 
ed. “Okay if you like that sort 
of thing.” 

A foarming mug of cappucino 
was lowered to his table on a 
stainless steel tray. Carmody 
sipped. 

“Good?” Bellwether asked. 

“Yes, very good.” 

“I rather pride myself on my 
coffee,” the city said quietly. 
“And on my cooking. Wouldn’t 
you care for a little something? 
An omelette, perhaps, or a souf- 
fle?” 

“Nothing,” Carmody said firm- 
ly. He leaned back in his chair 
and said, “So you’re a model city, 
huh?”” 

“Yes, that is that I have the 
honor to be,” Bellwether said. “I 
am the most recent of all model 
cities; and, I believe, the most 
satisfactory. I was conceived by 
a joint study group from Yale 
and the University of Chicago, 
who were working on a Rockefel- 
ler fellowship. Most of my prac- 
tical details were devised by 
M.I.T., although some special 
sections of me came from Prince- 
ton and from the RAND Cor- 
poration. My actual construction 
was a General Electric project, 

83 


and the money was procured by 
grants from the Ford and Carne- 
gie Foundations, as well as sev- 
eral other institutions I am not 
at liberty to mention.” 

‘‘Interesting sort of history,” 
Carmody said, with hateful non- 
chalance. “That’s a Gothic 
cathedral across the street, isn’t 
it?” 

“Modified Romanesque,” the 
city said. “Also interdenomina- 
tional and open to all faiths, with 
a designed seating capacity for 
three hundred people.” 

“That doesn’t seem like many 
for a building of that size.” 

“It’s not, of course. Designed- 
ly. My idea was to combine awe- 
someness with coziness.” 

“Where are the inhabitants of 
this town, by the way?” Carmo- 
dy asked. 

“They have left,” Bellwether 
said mournfully. “They have all 
departed.” 

“Why?” 

nphe city was silent for a while, 
then said. “There was a 
breakdown in city-community re- 
lations. A misunderstanding, real- 
ly. Or perhaps I should say, an 
unfortunate series of misunder- 
standings. I suspect that rabble- 
rousers played their part.” 

“But what happened, precise- 
ly?” 

“I don’t know,” the city said. 
“I really don’t know. One day 
84 


they simply all left. Just like 
that! But I’m sure they’ll be 
back.” 

“I wonder,” Carmody said. 

“I am convinced of it,” the city 
said. “But putting that aside; 
why don’t you stay here, Mr. 
Carmody?” 

“I haven’t really had time to 
consider it,” Carmody said. 

“How could you help but like 
it?” Bellwether said. “Just think 
— you would have the most 
modem, up-to-date city in the 
world at your beck and call.” 

“That does sound interesting,” 
Carmody said. 

“So give it a try, how could 
it hurt you?” the city asked. 

“All right, I think I will,” 
Carmody said. 

He was intrigued by the city 
of Bellwether. But he was also 
apprehensive. He wished he knew 
exactly why the city’s previous 
occupants had left. 

A t Bellwether’s insistence, Car- 
mody slept that night in the 
sumptuous bridal suite of the 
King George V Hotel. Bellwether 
served him breakfast on the ter- 
race and played a brisk Hayden 
quartet while Carmody ate. The 
morning air was delicious. If 
Bellwether hadn’t told him, Car- 
mody would never have guessed 
it was reconstituted. 

When he was finished, Car- 
mody leaned back and enjoyed 

GALAXY 


the view of Bellwether’s western 
quarter — a pleasing jumble of 
Chinese pagodas, Venetian foot- 
bridges, Japanese canals, a green 
Burmese hill, a Corinthian tem- 
ple, a Californian parking lot, 
a Norman tower and much else 
besides. 

“You have a spendid view,” 
he told the city. 

“I’m so glad you appreciate 
it,” Bellwether replied. “The 
problem of style was argued from, 
the day of my inception. One 
group held for consistency : a 
harmonious group of shapes 
blending into a harmonious 
whole. But quite a few model 
cities are like that. They are uni- 
formly dull, artificial entities 
created by one man or one com- 
mittee, unlike real cities.” 

“You’re sort of artificial your- 
self, aren’t you?” Carmody 
asked. 

“Of course! But I do not pre- 
tend to be anything else. I am 
not a fake ‘city of the future’ 
or a mock-florentine bastard. I 
am a true agglutinated congeries. 
I am supposed to be interesting 
and stimulating in addition to be- 
ing functional and practical.” 

“Bellwether, you look okay to 
me,” Carmody said, in a sudden 
rush of expansiveness. “Do all 
model cities talk like you?” 

“Certainly not. Most cities up 
to now, model or otherwise, 
never said a word. But their in- 
STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


habitants didn’t like that. It 
made the city seem too huge, 
too masterful, too soulless, too 
impersonal. That is why I was 
created with a voice and an ar- 
tificial consciousness to guide it.” 
“I see,” Carmody said. 

“The point is, my artificial 
consciousness personalizes me, 
Which is very important in an 
age of depersonalization. It en- 
ables me to be truly responsive. 
It permits me to be creative in 
meeting the demands of my oc- 
cupants. We can reason with 
each other, my people and I. By 
carrying on a continual and 
meaningful dialogue, we can help 
each other to establish a dynam- 
ic, flexible and truly viable urban 
environment. We can modify 
each other without any signifi- 
cant loss of individuality.” 

“It sounds fine,” Carmody 
said. “Except, of course, that you 
don’t have anyone here to carry 
on a dialogue with.” 

“That is the only flaw in the 
scheme,” the city admitted. “But 
for the present, I have you.” 
“Yes, you have me,” Carmody 
said and wondered why the 
words rang unpleasantly on his 
ear. 

“And, naturally, you have me,” 
the city said. “It is a reciprocal 
relationship, which is the only 
kind worth having. But now, my 
dear Carmody, suppose I show 
you around myself. Then we can 

85 


get you settled in and regu- 
larized.” 

“Get me what?” 

“I didn’t mean that the way it 
sounded,” the city said. “It simp- 
ly is an. unfortunate scientific 
expression. But you understand, 
I’m sure, that a reciprocal re- 
lationship necessitates obligations 
on the part of both involved par- 
ties. It couldn’t very well be 
otherwise, could it?” 

“Not unless it was a laissez- 
faire relationship.” 

“We’re trying to get away from 
all that,” Bellwether said. “Lais- 
sez-faire becomes a doctrine of 
the emotions, you know, and 
leads non-stop to anomie. If you 
will just come this way . .” 

Ill 

G armody went where he was 
asked and beheld the excel- 
lencies of Bellwether. He toured 
the power plant, the water fil- 
tration center, the industrial park 
and the light industries section. 
He saw the children’s park and 
the Odd Fellow’s Hall. He walk- 
ed through a museum and an 
art gallery, a concert hall and a 
theater, a bowling alley, a bil- 
liards parlor, a Go-Kart track 
and a movie theater. He became 
tired and wanted to stop. But the 
city wanted to show itself off, and 
Carmody had to look at the five- 
story American Express building, 
86 


the Portuguese synagogue, the 
statue of Buckminster Fuller, the 
Greyhound Bus Station and sev- 
eral other attractions. 

At last it was over. Carmody 
concluded that beauty was in the 
eye of the beholder, except for a 
small part of it that was in the 
beholder’s feet. 

“A little lunch now?” the city 
asked. 

“Fine,” Carmody said. 

He was guided to the fashion- 
able Rochambeau Cafe, where 
he began with potage au petit 
pois and ended with petits fours. 

“What about a nice Brie to 
finish off?” the city asked. 

“No, thanks,” Carmody said. 
“I’m full. Too full, as a matter 
of fact.” 

“But cheese isn’t filling. A bit 
of first-rate Camembert?” 

“I couldn’t possibly.” 

“Perhaps a few assorted fruits. 
Very refreshing to the palate.” 
“It’s not my palate that needs 
refreshing,” Carmody said. 

“At least an apple, a pear and 
a couple of grapes?” 

“Thanks, no.” 

“A couple of cherries?” 

“No, no, no!” 

“A meal isn’t complete with- 
out a little fruit,” the city said. 
“My meal is,” Carmody said. 
“There are important vitam- 
ins, only found in fresh fruit.” 
“I’ll just have to struggle along 
without them.” 


GALAXY 


“Perhaps half an orange, which 
I will peel for you? Citrus fruits 
have no, bulk at all.” 

“I couldn’t possibly.” 

“Not even one quarter of an 
orange? If I take out all the 
pits?” 

“Most decidedly not.” 

“It would make me feel bet- 
ter,” the city said. “I have 
a completion compulsion, you 
know, and no meal is complete 
without a piece of fruit.” 

“No! No! No!” 

“All right, don’t get so ex- 
cited,” the city said. “If you 
don’t like the sort of food I 
serve, that’s up to you.” 

“But I do like it!” 

“Then if you like it so much, 
Why won’t you eat some fruit?” 
“Enough,” Carmody said. 
“Give me a couple grapes.” 

“I wouldn’t want to force any- 
thing on you.” 

“You’re not forcing. Give me, 
please.” 

“You’re quite sure?” 

“Gimme!” Carmody shouted. 
“So take,” the city said and 
produced a magnificent bunch of 
muscatel grapes. Carmody ate 
them all. They were very good. 

t i T? xcuse me,” the city said. 

“What are you doing?” 
Carmody sat upright and 
opened his eyes. “I was taking a 
little nap,” he said. “Is there 
anything wrong with that?” 
STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


“What should be wrong with 
a perfectly natural thing like 
that?” the city said. 

“Thank you,” Carmody said, 
and closed his eyes again, 

“But why nap in a chair?” the 
city asked, 

“Because I’m in a chair, and 
I’m already half asleep.” 

“You’ll get a crick in your 
back,” the city warned him. 

“Don’t care,” Carmody mum- 
bled, his eyes still closed. 

“Why not take a proper nap? 
Over here, on the couch?” 

“I’m already napping comfor- 
tably right here.” 

“You’re not really comforta- 
ble,” the city pointed out. “The 
human anatomy is not construct- 
ed for sleeping sitting up.” 

“At the moment, mine is,” 
Carmody said. 

“It’s not. Why not try the 
couch?” 

“The chair is fine.” 

“But the couch is finer. Just 
try it, please, Carmody. Car- 
mody?” 

“Eh? What’s that?” Carmody 
said, waking up. 

“The couch. I really think you 
should rest on the couch.” 

“All right!” Carmody said, 
struggling to his feet. “Where is 
this couch?” 

He was guided out of the res- 
taurant, down the street, around 
the comer, and into a building 
marked “The Snoozerie.” There 

87 


were a dozen couches. Carmody 
went to the nearest. 

“Not that one,” the city said. 
“It’s got a bad spring.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Carmody 
said. “I’ll sleep around it.” 
“That will result in a cramped 
posture.” 

“Christ!” Carmody said, get- 
ting to his feet. “Which couch 
would you recommend?” 

“This one right back here,” 
the city said. “It’s a king-size, 
the best in the place. The yield- 
point of the mattress has been 
scientifically determined. The 
pillows — ” 

“Right, fine, good,” Carmody 
said, lying down on the indicated 
couch. 

“Shall I play you some sooth- 
ing music?” 

“Don’t bother.” 

“Just as you wish. I’ll put out 
the lights, then.” 

“Fine.” 

“Would you like a blanket? 
I control the temperature here, 
of course, but sleepers often get 
a subjective impression of chilli- 
ness.” 

“It doesn’t matter! Leave me 
alone!” 

“All right!” the city said. “I’m 
not doing this for myself, you 
know. Personally, I never sleep.” 
“Okay, sorry,” Carmody said. 
“That’s perfectly all right.” 
There was a long silence. Then 
Carmody sat up. 

88 


“What’s the matter?” the city 
asked. 

“Now I can’t sleep,” Carmody 
said. 

“Try closing your eyes and 
consciously relaxing every mus- 
cle in your body, starting with 
the big toe and working upward 
to — ” 

“I can’t sleep!” Carmody 
shouted. 

“Maybe you weren’t very 
sleepy to begin with,” the city 
suggested. “But at least you 
could close your eyes and try 
to get a little rest. Won’t you do 
that for me?” 

“No!” Carmody said. “I’m not 
sleepy and I don’t need a rest.” 

“Stubborn!” the city said. “Do 
what you like. I’ve tried my 
best.” 

“Yeah,” Carmody said, getting 
to his feet and walking out of 
the Snoozerie.

f ''armody stood on a little 
^ curved bridge and looked 
over a blue lagoon. 

“This is a copy of the Rialto 
bridge in Venice,” the city said. 
“Scaled down, of course.” 

“I know,” Carmody said. “I 
read the sign.” 

“It’s rather enchanting, isn’t 
it?” 

“Sure, it’s fine,” Carmody said, 
lighting a cigarette. 


GALAXY 


“You’re doing a lot of smok- 
ing,” the city pointed out. 

“I know. I feel like smoking.” 
“As your medical advisor, I 
must point out that the link be- 
tween smoking and lung cancer 
is conclusive.” 

“I know.” 

“If you switched to a pipe, 
your chances would be im- 
proved.” 

“I don’t like pipes.” 

“What about a cigar, then?” 
“I don’t like cigars.” He lit an- 
other cigarette. 

“That’s your third cigarette in 
five minutes,” the City said. 

“Goddamn it, I’ll smoke as 
much and as often as I please!” 
Carmody shouted. 

“Well, of course you will!” the 
city said. “I was merely trying 
to advise you for your own good. 
Would you want me to simply 
stand by and not say a word 
while you destroyed yourself?” 
“Yes,” Carmody said. 

“I can’t believe that you mean 
that. There is an ethical impera- 
tive involved here. Man can act 
against his best interests; but a 
machine is not allowed that de- 
gree of perversity.” 

“Get off my back,” Carmody 
said sullenly. “Quit pushing me 
around.” 

“Pushing you around? My 
dear Carmody, have I coerced 
you in any way? Have I done 
any more than advise you?” 
STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


“Maybe not. But you talk too 
much.” 

“Perhaps I don’t talk enough,” 
the city said. “To judge from 
the response I get.” 

“You talk too much,” Carmo- 
dy repeated and lit a cigarette. 

“That is your fourth cigarette 
in five minutes.” 

Carmody opened his mouth to 
bellow an insult. Then he chang- 
ed his mind and walked away. 

CtTTfThat’s this?” Carmody 
™ * asked. 

“It’s a candy machine,” the 
city told him. 

“It doesn’t look, like one.” 

“Still, it is one. This design is 
a modification of a design by 
Saarionrnen for a silo. I have 
miniaturized it, of course, 
and — ” 

“It still doesn’t look like a 
candy machine. How do you 
work it?” 

“It’s very simple. Push the red 
button. Now wait. Press down 
one of those levers on Row A; 
now press the green button. 
There!” 

A Baby Ruth bar slid into 
Carmody’s hand. 

“Huh,” Carmody said. He 
stripped off the paper and bit in- 
to the bar. “Is this a real Baby 
Ruth bar or a copy of one?” 
he asked. 

“It’s a real one. I had to sub- 
contract the candy concession be- 

89 


cause of the pressure of work.” 

“Huh,” Camiody said, letting 
the candy wrapper slip from his 
fingers. 

“That,” the city said, “is an. 
example of the kind of thought- 
lessness I always encounter.” 

“It’s just a piece of paper,” 
Carmody said, turning and look- 
ing at the candy wrapper lying 
on the spotless street. 

“Of course it’s just a piece of 
paper,” the city said. “But mul- 
tiply it by a hundred thousand 
inhabitants and what do you 
have?” 

“A hundred thousand Baby 
Ruth wrappers,” Carmody ans- 
wered at once. 

“I don’t consider that funny,” 
the city said. “You wouldn’t 
want to live in the midst of all 
that paper, I can assure you. 
You’d be the first to complain 
if this street were strewn with 
garbage. But do you do your 
share? Do you even clean up 
after yourself? Of course not! 
You leave it to me, even though 
I have to run all of the other 
functions, of the city, night and 
day, without even Sundays off.” 

Carmody bent down to pick 
up the candy wrapper. But just 
before his fingers could close on 
it, a pincer arm shot out of the 
nearest sewer, snatched the pa- 
per away and vanished from 
sight. 

“It’s all right,” the city said. 
90 


“I’m used to cleaning up after 
people. I do it all the time.” 

“Yuh,” said Carmody. 

“Nor do I expect any grati- 
tude.” 

“I’m grateful, I’m grateful!” 
Carmody said. 

“No, you’re not,” Bellwether 
said. 

“So okay, maybe I’m not. 
What do you want me to say?” 

“I don’t want you to say any- 
thing,” the city said. “Let us 
consider the incident closed.” 

C C T Tad enough?” the city said, 
after dinner. 

“Plenty,” Carmody said. 

“You didn’t eat much.” 

“I ate all I wanted. It was 
very good.” 

“If it was so good, why didn’t 
you eat more?” 

“Because I couldn’t hold any 
more.” 

“If you hadn’t spoiled your 
appetite with that candy 
bar . .” 

“Goddamn it, the candy bar 
didn’t spoil my appetite! I just 

“You’re lighting a cigarette,” 
the city said. 

“Yeah,” Carmody said. 

“Couldn’t you wait a little 
longer?” 

“Now look,” Carmody said, 
“Just what in hell do you — ” 

“But we have something more 
important to talk about,” the 

GALAXY 




city said quickly. “Have you 
thought about what you’re going 
to do for a living?” 

“I haven’t really had much 
time to think about it.” 

“Well, I have been thinking 
about it. It would be nice if you 
became a doctor.” 

“Me? I’d have to take a spe- 
cial college courses, then get into 
medical school, and so forth.” 

“I can arrange all that,” the 
city said. 

“Not interested.” 

“Well .... What about law?” 
“Never.” 

“Engineering is an excellent 
line.” 

“Not for me.” 

“What about accounting?” 
“Not on your life.” 

“What do you want to be?” 
“A jet pilot,” Carmody, said 
impulsively. 

“Oh, come now!” 

“I’m quite serious.” 

“I don’t even have an air field 
here.” 

“Then I’ll pilot somewhere 
else.” 

“You’re only saying, that to 
spite me!” 

“Not at all,” Carmody said. 
“I want to be a pilot, I really 
do. I’ve always wanted to be a 
pilot! Honest I have!” 

There was a long silence. Then 
the city said, “The choice is en- 
tirely up to you.” This was said 
in a voice like death.

CCTXThere are you going now?” 
* ^ “Out for a walk,” Car- 
mody said. 

“At nine-thirty in the eve- 
ning?” 

“Sure. Why not?” 

“I thought you were tired.” 
“That was quite some time 
ago.” 

“I see. And I also thought that 
you could sit here and we could 
have a nice chat.” 

“How about if we talk after I 
get back?” Carmody asked. 

“No, it doesn’t matter,” the 
city said. 

“The walk doesn’t matter,” 
Carmody said, sitting down. 
“Come on, we’ll talk.” 

“I no longer care to talk,” 
the city said. “Please go for 
your walk.” 

V 

tCV^Tell’ good night,” Carmo- 
’ ’ dy said. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I said, ‘good night.’ ” 

“You’re going to sleep?” 
“Sure. IP’s late, I’m tired.” 
“You’re going to sleep now?” 
“Well, why not?” 

“No reason at all,” the city 
said, “except that you have for- 
gotten to wash.” 

“Oh .... I guess I did for- 
get. I’ll wash in the morning.” 
“How long is it since you’ve 
had a bath?” 


GALAXY 


“Too long. I’ll take one in 
the morning.” 

“Wouldn’t you feel better if 
you took one right now?” 

“No.” 

“Even if I drew the bath for 
you?” 

“No! Goddamn it, no! I’m go- 
ing to sleep!” 

“Do exactly as you please,” 
the city said. “Don’t wash, don’t 
study, don’t eat a balanced diet. 
But also, don’t blame me.” 
“Blame you? For what?” 

“For anything,” the city said. 
“Yes. But what did you have 
in mind, specifically?” 

“It isn’t important.” 

“Then why did you bring it 
up in the first place?” 

“I was only thinking of you,” 
the city said. 

“I realize that.” 

“You must know that it can’t 
benefit me if you wash or not.” 
“I’m aware of that.” 

“When one cares,” the city 
went on, “when one feels one’s 
responsibilities, it is not nice to 
hear oneself sworn at.” 

“I didn’t swear at you.” 

“Not this time. But earlier to- 
day you did.” 

“Well .... I was nervous.” 
“That’s because of the smok- 
ing.” 

“Don’t start that again!” 

“I won’t,” the city said. 
“Smoke like a furnace. What 
does it matter to me?” 

STREET OF DREAMS, FEET OF CLAY 


“Damned right,” Carmody 
said, lighting a cigarette. 

“But my failure,” the city said. 

“No, no,” Carmody said. 

“Don’t say it, please don’t!” 

“Forget I said it,” the city 
said. 

“All right.” 

“Sometimes I get over- 
zealous.” 

“Sure.” 

“And it’s especially difficult 
because I’m right. I am right, 
you know.” 

“I know,” Carmody said. 
“You’re right, you’re right, you’re 
always right. Right right right 
right right — ” 

“Don’t overexcite yourself be- 
time,” the city said. “Would 
you care for a glass of milk?” 

“No.” 

“You’re sure?” 

Carmody put his hands over 
his eyes. He felt very strange. 
He also felt extremely guilty, 
fragile, dirty, unhealthy and 
sloppy. He felt generally and 
irrevocably bad, and it would 
always be this way unless he 
changed, adjusted, adapted . 

But instead of attempting any- 
thing of the sort he rose to his 
feet, squared his shoulders, and 
marched away past the Roman 
piazza and the Venetian bridge.

Silent, tight-lipped, Carmody 
continued past the children’s 
park and the American Express 
building. 

“What did I do wrong?” the 
city cried. “What, just tell me 
what?” 

Carmody made no reply but 
strode past the Rochambeau 
Cafe and the Portuguese synago- 
gue, coming at last to the pleas- 
ant green plain that surrounded 
Bellwether. 

“Ingrate!” the city screamed 
after him. “You’re just like all 
the others. All of you humans 
are disagreeable animals, and 
you’re never really satisfied with 
anything.” 

Carmody got into his car and 
started the engine. 

“But of course,” the city said, 
in a more thoughtful voice, 
“you’re never really dissatisfied 
with anything, either. The moral, 
I suppose, is that a city must 
learn patience.” 

Carmody turned the car onto 
King’s Highbridge Gate Road 
and started east, toward New 
York. 

“Have a nice trip!” Bellwether 
called after him. “Don’t worry 
about me, I’ll be waiting up for 
you.” 

Carmody stepped down hard 
on the accelerator. He really 
wished he hadn’t heard that last 
remark.

BY WELLY LEY 


EPITAPH FOR 
A LONELY Oil 

A bout eight months ago the 
New York Zoological Soci- 
ety suffered a loss that was not 
noticed by most of the visitors 
to the Zoo. A single olm that 
had survived its companions for 
five lonely years finally died, pre- 
sumably of old age. This sole 
survivor of a group of eight that 


95 



The Balkan cave salamander Proteus anguinus, known as Olm. 
Drawn from a live specimen by G. Mutzel in 1895. 


had arrived in 1961 had been the 
only olm in the United States. 

The man who first mentioned 
the olm in print, and might 
therefore be called its discoverer, 
was Johann Weichard, Baron von 
Valvasor, who, in 1689, published 
a book with the title Die Ehre des 
Herzogthums Krain. Translated 
this reads: The Honor of the 
Dukedom of Krain. The Krain 
was a part of the old Austro- 
Hungarian Empire and is now a 
section of northern Yugoslavia. 
Somewhere in the mountains of 
that section of the Balkans drag- 
ons could be found, the people 
insisted. The baron was not sure 
96 


whether the existence of dragons 
would increase or decrease “the 
honor” of the dukedom he was 
writing about — at any event 
he investigated. Finally some- 
body brought him a “young drag- 
on”; it was a span, or about 9 
inches, in length, “and resembled 
a lizard.” He also added a re- 
mark that seems to mean that 
they are found only sometimes 
but not all the time. 

About sixty years later an 
Italian, Scopoli by name, became 
interested in the small animal 
with the red external gills and 
the dead-white skin. The local 
fishermen told him that they 

GALAXY 


never caught one except when 
the river flooded. Scopoli, of 
whom practically nothing is 
known otherwise, also reported 
that the fishermen called it “the 
humanfish,” presumably because 
it lacks scales and its skin is 
white. Scopoli’s final service to 
zoology consisted in presenting a 
specimen to the deacon of a lo- 
cal church, Court Siegmund von 
Hohenwart, who was interested in 
local natural history. He in turn 
forwarded the specimen to Pro- 
fessor Laurenti of the University 
of Vienna, who provided the first 
scientific description and also 
coined its scientific name: Pro- 
teus anguinus. The first part of 
the name refers to Neptune’s 
herdsman (only Prof. Laurenti 
knows why), while the second 
part comes from the Latin word 
ariguis meaning “snake” and es- 
pecially a small snake. 

The common name olm ap- 
peared first in the German bio- 
logical journal Isis in about 1825 
and was coined by its editor, the 
naturalist Lorenz Oken (1779- 
1851). I have never been able to 
find out what “olm” means or 
whether it has a meaning, but the 
name caught on and is in inter- 
national use. (To pronounce it 
properly say ollem first and then 
suppress the “e”.) 

T aurenti had determined cor- 
' rectly that the animal was 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


an amphibian related to newts 
and salamanders and that it lived 
in subterranean waters all its life. 
By now the idea of “cave sala- 
manders” is well established, but 
the olm was the first to be dis- 
covered and it was quite sensa- 
tional for this reason. Soon both 
its main habitat and the reason 
for its sporadic appearance be- 
came known. The main habitat 
was, and is, a large subterranean 
lake, the Grotto of Adelsberg 
(or Postojna jama in Serbian, 
now the official name). When 
the spring thaw was sudden, re- 
leasing large quantities of water, 
the Adelsberg grotto and a dozen 
smaller ones in the vicinity were 
flooded and the olms were wash- 
ed into the rivers. 

The average length of a fully 
grown olm is 10 inches; a few 
specimens that grew to 12 inches 
have been reported. The olm 
swims by wriggling its whole 
body; the four short legs are 
useless for locomotion. The fore- 
legs have three clawless toes, the 
hindlegs only two. Because of the 
concentration of blood vessels the 
gills are a brilliant red, while the 
body is white or very faintly 
pink. There are no visible eyes; 
the skin extends unbroken over 
the places where the eyes should 
be. But when dissecting an olm, 
rudimentary eyes, connected to 
the brain by optical nerves, can 
easily be found.

Now a salamander is consider- 
ed to be the larval form as long 
as it has gills; normally a sala- 
mander, after spending its youth 
in water, goes on land, sheds its 
gills and, among other things, 
propagates its kind. The environ- 
ment of the olm prevents it from 
following this procedure, but the 
olms propagated nonetheless. It 
was the first case of a larva be- 
ing capable of sexual activity — 
another fact that increased the 
olm’s fame. Naturalists were so 
surprised that they coined a new 
term for this behavior: “neo- 
teny.” We now know that the olm 
is not the only neotenic salaman- 
der; the Mexican axolotl as well 
as the “mudpuppies” (Necturus) 
of the United States are neotenic 
too. A complete list of neotenic 
forms would probably consist of 
at least a dozen mostly unfamiliar 
names. 

Naturalists saw themselves 
confronted by an eyeless neo- 
tenic salamander that spends its 
whole life in the cold water of a 
lightless cave, and the first ques- 
tion that occurred to them was: 
what does it eat? And speaking 
of food, how does it find what- 
ever it eats? Salamanders do not 
eat anything vegetable, hence 
the food had to consist of insects, 
spiders, small fresh-water crus- 
taceans, possibly fish eggs. 
Strictly speaking we still do not 
know What the olms of the Adels- 
98 


berg grotto eat when at home, 
we only know what they will eat 
in captivity. 

Tpor decades the olm was the 
favorite aquarium animal of 
European naturalists, if only be- 
cause the preferred observation 
“in the field” was an impossibili- 
ty. Just to get to the “noble 
mountain” (this is What Adels - 
berg means) was a tiring journey. 
A trip across the cave could be 
arranged by local guides for a fee, 
but people need light to see; and 
while the cave fauna is blind, it 
is still light-sensitive enough to 
swim away from illumination. 
Therefore, since the journey of 
the naturalist to the olm was use- 
less, the olm was brought to the 
naturalist. 

The first long series of obser- 
vations of captive specimens was 
carried out by Fraulein Marie 
von Chauvin, one of the early 
female scientists, who lived in 
Freiburg im Breisgau, in western 
Germany. Her study began in 
about 1880 and lasted for many 
years. She fed small worms (Tu- 
biiex, as well as small earth- 
worms), young water snails, tad- 
poles and fresh-water crustaceans 
to her olms and soon saw that it 
was the motion of the food ani- 
mals that made the olms aware 
of their presence. If a snail re- 
mained motionless it was disre- 
garded. In general that olms re- 

GALAXY 


mained at the bottoms of their 
containers, but if the water was 
very shallow they might come 
to the surface to inhale air, Marie 
von Chauvin noticed that a sud- 
den shock (somebody in the 
house had dropped something 
heavy) caused the olms to panic; 
in their subterranean lakes a 
shock wave in the water is evi- 
dently a danger signal. 

Marie von Chauvin could do 
almost anything for her olms; 
she could provide fresh water at 
a temperature of from 48 to 52 
degrees Fahrenheit; she could 
feed them what they liked to eat 
or would at least accept; but 
she could not keep light away all 
the time. After all, she wanted to 
observe them. If the period of 
illumination was not longer than 
2 or 3 minutes per day, nothing 
happened, but if the olms were 
exposed even to weak light for 
a few hours a day they developed 
color in their skin. Some turned 
a reddish brown. Others, and this 
was the more customary change, 
turned a bluish black. It began 
with spots that enlarged and 
blended together and in some in- 
dividuals tiny yellow or reddish 
spots appeared on the dark back- 
ground. 

Was this dark coloration with 
small spots the original color of 
the olm’s ancestors? It seemed 
likely, for the olm certainly had 
not evolved in those dark waters. 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


At one time its ancestors must 
have been open-air salamanders 
with protective coloration and 
with functioning eyes. Then they 
became trapped underground in 
an environment that kept them 
alive by feeding them, but where 
there was no need for either eye- 
sight or for coloration. Since they 
could not evolve into finished 
salamanders they turned neoterdc, 
though they might have had this 
characteristic while still in the 
open air. 

T rhen Marie von Chauvin be- 

' ' gan to keep olms, she had 
already had experience with an- 
other neotenic salamander, the 
axolotl. 

Back in 1864 the Jardin d’a c- 
climation in Paris had received 
half a dozen axolotls from Mexi- 
co. They were cared for by the 
curator, Monsieur A. Dumeril, 
who knew what was then known 
about them and who was, there- 
fore, not too surprised when they 
started mating a year later. The 
second generation was raised in 
separate tanks and grew nearly 
as large as the original imports 
half a year after hatching. So far 
everything went as expected', but 
then some of the new generation 
began to change into a finished 
gill-less adult salamander. Mon- 
sieur Dumeril tried to accelerate 
the change in those that had 
stayed in the water by amputat- 

99 


ing half of their gills. It did not 
work; the axolotls simply grew 
another bunch of gills. 

Marie von Chauvin, after read- 
ing Dumeril’s report, decided on 
persuasion rather than operation. 
When she saw that one of her 
five axolotls stayed near the sur- 
face of the water most of the 
time she put him into another 
aquarium where there was only a 
small and shallow water area; 
most of the floor space was land, 
with lush wet moss. The axolotl 
took just four days to change in- 
to the adult form. Three others 
went through the same change 
a few weeks later, but the fifth 
specimen (which was the smallest 
of the lot) never changed. It re- 
mained a water -living axolotl. 

Since it had been so easy to 
make the axolotl go through its 
full life cycle, Marie von Chau- 
vin tried to make the olm do the 
same. It did not work; olms 
would grow black but never shed 
their gills. Any attempt to force 
the issue only resulted in the 
death of the specimen. The olms, 
it seemed, had adjusted so well 
to their cave environment that 
they could not revert to the 
original any more. 

As a by-product of her work 
Marie von Chauvin had estab- 
lished that the eggs of the olm 
are spherical with a diameter of 
about 10 millimeters. They have 
a sticky outer layer, and the fe- 
100 


mals attached them one by one 
to a stone. That olms lay eggs 
had also been seen seven years 
earlier, in 1875, by one of the 
tourist guides at Adelsberg. The 
larvae hatching from the eggs 
had been quite large, about an 
inch in length as had been estab- 
lished by A. Zeller in 1888 ■ — he 
had needed patience for this ob- 
servation, for 90 days went by be- 
tween the laying of the eggs 
and the hatching of a few of 
them. 

Zeller was pleased with his re- 
sults, but somebody else had 
been digging in a library and had 
come up with an issue of Oken’s 
Isis dating from the year 1831. 
And that issue contained a re- 
port from a landowner at Stratil 
(in the area where the olm oc- 
curs naturally) with the name of 
J. Geek von Verch. He was the 
county judge in addition to being 
a landowner, and his story was 
put down in language fit for a 
supreme court decision. “On 
June 17, 1852 I, as well as mem- 
bers of my own family and mem- 
bers of my neighbor’s families, 
witnessed the birth of a live 
young olm.” The young was 1% 
inches long and shaped like an 
adult, but it had two black spots 
“like poppyseeds” where one 
would expect the eyes to be. 

XT That could one say now? 

' ' Several tourist guides, one 

GALAXY 


professional naturalist (Marie 
von Chauvin) and one amateur 
naturalist (Zeller) bad watched 
the egg-laying. Zeller bad even 
watched the hatching. But one 
could not disregard the solemn 
statement of the old county 
judge. 

Was it possible that there were 
two species of olms, indistin- 
guishable by humans and certain- 
ly closely related, but differing 
from each other by the method 
of propagation? One species that 
laid eggs — from 35 to 50 in 
number — like most salaman- 
ders? And another species that 
hatched an egg in the oviduct 
and produced a live and larger 
young? And all this coupled with 
neoteny! 

That something looks incredi- 
ble does not matter in nature. 
Facts are facts, and what was 
needed to arrive at an opinion 
were more facts. The next fact 
came from a Professor Nusbaum 
in Lemberg. 

He had bought five specimens 
for dissection and placed the 
glass jar holding them on the 
window sill. Of course they turn- 
ed dark, but that was unimpor- 
tant considering their final fate. 
When Professor Nusbaum — who 
had already dissected two of 
them — looked at the jar on the 
morning of October 12, 1904, he 
saw four olms instead of three. 
The fourth was pale, skinny and 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


small; it must have been born 
alive during the night. That it 
died a few hours later is unimpor- 
tant; here was another case of a 
live birth with no eggs in evidence 
anywhere. 

By that time experiments 
with olms were being carried on 
in Vienna, at the Institute for 
Experimental Biology. It belong- 
ed to the venerable University 
of Vienna but was located in the 
Vienna Prater, the amusement 
area. The heavy stone building 
had originally been sponsored by 
a Habsburg prince as a public 
aquarium. Subsequently it had 
been turned — more in keeping 
with the surroundings — into a 
very intimate night club. When 
the night club went bankrupt, 
around the year 1900, the Uni- 
versity of Vienna acquired the 
building. 

The basement then had con- 
tained a cistern and was not 
waterproof in general; one of the 
first steps taken by the Univer- 
sity’s contractor was to pump 
it dry. But the windowless base- 
ment, where the temperature 
never rose above 55 degrees 
Fahrenheit, was a perfect natural 
grotto, suitable for cave sala- 
manders. One quarter of the now 
dry basement was enclosed by a 
foot-high wall and filled with 
well water, making a dark aquar- 
ium one foot deep with an area 
of 120 square feet. 


101 


Tn 1903 it was ready and forty 

olms were purchased to be 
kept there. The purpose of the 
experiment was to find out 
whether the olm lays eggs or 
produces live young — or wheth- 
er there were two species which 
humans could not tell apart. Hu- 
mans cannot even tell the sexes 
apart. Hence the large number; it 
was highly unlikely that all forty 
would belong to the same sex. 
The young biologist in charge, 
Dr. Paul Kammerer, saw to it 
that they were well fed and 
otherwise left them alone. 

During his frequent trips to 
the basement for feeding and in- 
spection he looked for young or 
eggs. One year went by and 
there were neither young nor 
eggs. Another half year went by 
with the same negative result. 
Kammerer, unwilling to believe 
in the improbability of all 39 
olms (one had died) being either 
male or females, lost interest. It 
tines not seem to have occurred 
to him that the olm’s asexual 
behavior was due to overfeeding, 
but his loss of interest corrected 
this factor. 

He fed them When he thought 
of it, and in October 1905 he 
thought he saw a few smaller ones 
in the tank but did not accept 
tihem as young. He thought they 
bad shrunk from lack of food and 
became a little more diligent as 
a result. By May 1906 he saw 
102 


a few small specimens that had 
to be young because they still 
had eye spots. In October 1907 
he saw a large olm that looked 
pregnant. He caught it and put it 
into a separate jar which was left 
in the dark basement. Two weeks 
later there were two small olms, 
nearly 4 inches long, in the jar 
with the adult. 

Then he really went to work, 
and two years later he announced 
his findings. When olms are kept 
in water that is warmer than 55 
degrees Fahrenheit the females 
will lay eggs, of which only a 
small percentage (say one in 
twenty-five), will hatch. If the 
water is colder, one egg will hatch 
in one oviduct of the female, or 
sometimes, one in each oviduct 
while the other eggs degenerate 
into a kind of jelly which may be 
absorbed either by the body of 
the mother or else feed the em- 
broyo that has hatched. At any 
event the young that are born 
alive are about twice as large as 
those that have hatched from 
eggs. Since the temperature in 
the natural cave lakes is always 
colder than 55 degrees Fahren- 
heit, Kammerer concluded that 
live birth was normal for the olm. 

T>ecause of subsequent events 
-*-* Kammerer’s name acquired 
a bad reputation. He was obsess- 
ed with proving a discredited 
biological concept, namely the in- 

GALAXY 


heritance of acquired characteris- 
tics, and he produced charts that 
could not be true. He faked’ “ac- 
quired characteristics” by such 
means as injections of India ink 
under the skin of toads and, after 
having been found out, com- 
mitted suicide. 

It is not surprising that every- 
thing Kammerer bad said was 
suspect after his death, but his 
first set of experiments with olms 
was probably geniune. For his 
second olm experiment one can- 
not be certain any more. He de- 
cided that he would succeed 
where Marie von. Chauvin had 
failed; he would force an olm to 
acquire the adult shape of its 
ancestors. Specifically he would 
try to make a young olm keep 
and develop its eyes. 

I n the meantime the keepers of 
other aquaria had solved a prob- 
lem. They had olms and they 
wanted to exhibit 'them to the 
public. Of course one could just 
illuminate the aquaria, but then 
the olms would turn black. The 
ideal was to exhibit olms that 
stayed pale. One of the keepers 
reasoned as follows: a photo- 
graphic plate, exposed to light, 
turns black. But in the darkroom 
undeveloped plates can be han- 
dled safely under red light, red 
light being less capable of caus- 
ing chemical changes than white 
light. He tried it, and. it worked; 
an olm under “darkroom illumi- 
FOR. YOUR INFORMATION 


nation” was made dimly visible 
to visitors but it remained pale. 

Kammerer took a young ©hn 
and let it grow under red light, 
hoping that this would stimulate 
the eyes without thickening the 
skin that covered them. From 
time to time he exposed it to day- 
light for stronger stimulation. Of 
course the skin slowly turned 
black but only after the eyes 
were established and stayed un- 
covered. All the while the speci- 
men was kept in only one inch 
of water to stimulate the lungs. 
He obtained a black olm with 
clearly visible and presumably 
functioning eyes that could live 
for short periods outside the 
water. 

When Kammerer announced 
this result nobody doubted his 
word — after all this was a pos- 
sible result which merely had re- 
quired extra -ordinary care. But 
after it became known that 
Kammerer had been dishonest in 
other experiments, the "adult 
olm” was doubted in retrospect. 

Since I knew that old professor 
Dr. Richard B. Goldschmidt had 
known Kammerer personally (I 
had not because of an age differ- 
ence of about 25 years), I asked 
him whether he had seen the 
‘‘adult olm.” Professor Gold- 
schmidt, then at the University 
of California, replied that Kam- 
merer had shown, him a specimen 
with normal eyes. But he, also 

103 


doubtful in retrospect, added that 
Kammerer might have trans- 
planted “different eyes,” meaning 
the eyes of another amphibian. 
Goldschmidt summed up his and 
everybody’s feelings by writing: 
“The thing should be repeated!” 
The University of Vienna did 
nothing to clear up the uncer- 
tainties caused by Kammerer. 
After the second World War a 
new research ceter, approximate- 
ly named the Underground 
Laboratory of the Centre Nation- 
ale de la Recherche Scientifique, 
began to be interested in olms. 
As its name indicates it is French, 
located at Moulis, France, under

the leadership of Professor Al- 
bert Vandel. Professor Vandel 
keeps his olms in tanks 3 feet in 
diameter and ten times as long 
with running water but a layer of 
cave mud and flat stones at the 
bottom. The water is kept at 
about 55 degrees Fahrenheit; the 
darkness in the underground 
laboratory is complete. Under 
these circumstances the olms are 
egg-layers and Vandel swears 
that this is the normal method. 

Most of what has been reported 
so far is not new or adds only 
small detail to the information 
that can be found in zoological 
literature. The number of eggs 
laid by one female is from 20 to 
60, and the interval between lay- 
ing and hatching runs from 100 
to 120 days. At hatching the 
young olm still has a reserve of 
yolk that lasts for about a month. 
Its rate of growth afterward is 
exceedingly slow; it needs 8 to 10 
years to reach a length of 6 
inches. The reduction of the em- 
bryonic eye is reported to begin 
at the age of three months. 

Well, this means that we know 
about as much as we did in 1900. 
So far the French laboratory 
seems to have limited its activi- 
ties to observation only. One day, 
one hopes, Professor Vandel will 
be overcome by the urge to ex- 
periment a little. Then he may 
clear up Kammerer’s doubtful 
legacy. — WILLY LEY

II by ROBERT BLOCH 

W hat to do with the population 
problem? Killing people's so 
messy — .unless they'll help! 


anuaiy 15, 2047. Big day to- 
day. Flying in, I got quite a 
shock seeing that mushroom 
cloud over Washington. Looked 
just like an H-bomb, but of 
course it’s only the population 
explosion. Smog. 

It’s everywhere, of course, but 
this air-conditioned underground 
living makes you forget. I hate 
the nuisance of wearing a res- 
pirator, but this time I was grate- 
ful for it. Even without the smog, 
the crowd here is so thick that 
the fumes from their halitosis 
would probably choke you. 

Priority Escort had a zip-car 
waiting for me when we landed. 
That was a break — we took 
the fifth-level freeway right 
straight in, down what used to 
be the old Pennsylvania Avenue. 

Could do a whole book on 
the White House. Like stepping 


into the past; so quiet and emp- 
ty. Huge rooms. Some of them 
twenty, thirty, even fifty feet 
long — you wouldn’t believe it. 
To think people used to live 
that way; all that space, and not 
even a high-rise! Gives you a 
sense of History. 

Of course the big thing was 
meeting the President. Kind of 
surprising to see he’s such a small 
man. Watching him on TV, in 
full makeup, you get the impres- 
sion he’s quite tall. But without 
the gray wig and the beard and 
the Uncle Sam costume, he’s 
only a little guy. Can’t quite re- 
member when Presidents started 
wearing the outfit — way back, 
I guess, maybe twenty-thirty 
years after they started electing 
actors to public office. It’s ef- 
fective, of course, and I can see 
the sense, but it’s still kind of a 


105 


letdown when you see a Presi- 
dent offscreen. Without a tele- 
prompter and the folksy delivery 
he sounds quite different. 

But he’s an exec, no doubt 
about it. The way he handled 
the meeting, all the biggies there 
— Cabinet, Defense, even the top 
lobbyists. Cut right through pro- 
tocol and got down to cases. 

No sense trying to remember 
exact quotes. What he said was 
Security-sealed anyway, and I 
could get into trouble just para- 
phrasing it. But then, nobody is 
going to be playing this diary- 
tape anyway, and I want to keep 
it for the record. 

He started right out by laying 
all the cards on the table. The 
population crisis — 988,000,000 
people in the United States as 
of last week’s Galiupcomputer 
census. 

“That’s the official figure,” he 
said. 

“Actually, we’re way over 
a billion. But we can’t let that 
get out, for psychological rea- 
sons. There’s enough panic as it 
is. And with a world population 
of nineteen billion, a projected 
fifty billion within another gen- 
eration — ” 

He stopped and looked around 
the table; I wish I had a photo 
of those faces. “I can see your 
reactions,” he said. “But right 
now I’m more interested in hear- 
ing your solutions.” 

106 


Hphat’s how it began. And for 
the next hour it went on, 
hot and heavy. All 'the old argu- 
ments and counter-arguments. 

Start a war? Too dangerous, 
and besides it’s never worked — 
if it had, we wouldn’t be in this 
fix today. 

What about a sterilization law? 
Six bills voted down already, too 
much religious opposition, so 
that’s out. 

Metal fatigue in jets and zip- 
cars? There was one that made 
me sit up and take notice. Some 
character from the Department 
of Transport had it all laid out, 
a full presentation with a lot of 
figures on stress-factors and 
built-in structural defects. He 
was willing to guarantee that ac- 
cidents, freeway and airway, 
would eliminate at least a hun- 
dred million over a three-year 
period. 

It made a lot of sense to me, 
until the President reminded him 
that (a) such a program would 
shake confidence in automotive 
and aviation products, thus dis- 
rupting the economy, and (b) 
the present rate of population in- 
crease would soon offset and over 
take the possible death-rate. He 
was loudly seconded by the lob- 
byists, particularly in regard to 
point (a). 

The next joker came up with 
the moon-colorization bit again 
and had to be reminded that it 

GALAXY 


would be impossible to manufac- 
ture enough space-hardware to 
transport more than a few million 
people a year — granted that the 
economy could support such a 
program. 

Somebody else urged official 
government backing of homo- 
sexuality; not just quiet appro- 
val, but a full-fledged open en- 
dorsement. The Secretary of 
Health and Welfare pointed out 
that even without open sanction, 
homosexuality was already a 
widespread popular craze, but 
largely due to the fact that it 
wasn’t officially blessed. Such 
approval, he thought, would 
backfire, robbing the practice 
of any illicit “kick,” and bring 
the movement to a fag-end. 

This remark got a laugh, but 
didn’t solve anything. 

The next proposal came from 
Top Brass — all creased red 
neck and eyebrows, and no non- 
sense. At first he sounded way 
off the track, talking about smog 
and its lethal effect on the hu- 
man organism, but then he hit it. 
“If you really want to reduce 
the population, quit wasting 
your breath. Waste theirs. Take 
away their respirators.” 

That did it. Everybody start- 
ed screaming, but the President 
got the final word in. 

“You just can’t go ahead and 
start a mass-murder program — 
it’s un-American!” 

SALES OF A DEATHMAN 


And then he looked at me. 
“You’re the expert, Mr. Crothers. 
What does Psychological En- 
gineering propose?” 

I let them have it, then. “Of 
course it’s un-American to kill 
our own citizens. Also, it’s bad 
for business.” That got a nod 
from everybody, so I went on. 
“But there’s another solution. I 
call it planned population-obso- 
lescence.” 

The President frowned. “And 
just what does that mean?” 
“Simple. Since we can’t kill 
our own citizens, and we can’t 
encourage them to kill each 
other, there’s only one sensible 
alternative. We’ve got to get the 
people to kill themselves.” 

Now they really screamed. 
“Mass suicide? Impossible — 
they’d never go for it — talk 
about hurting business, this 
would really do it — never work 
out — ” 

I waited until they wore them- 
selves out, then opened my fold- 
er and my mouth. 

“Gentlemen, I have prepared a 
plan. If you’re ready to listen, I 
think I can demonstrate to you 
that it can be done.” 

I made my pitch. It grabbed 
them, because it made sense. The 
President was the only one with 
reservations. 

“I don’t know,” he sighed. “A 
wiser statesman than myself once 
said, ’You can kill some of the 

107 


people some of the time, but you 
can’t kill all of the people all 
of the time.” 

“Maybe so,” I said. “But it’s 
worth a try.” 

ebruary 10, 2047. We’re in 
business. 

Haven’t had time to tape notes 
— it’s just one meeting after an- 
other. Key people in industry, 
advertising, communication chan- 
nels. Even with official backing, 
it’s a big selling job. 

At first, of course, everybody 
comes up with the same objec- 
tion — “But we need consum- 
ers.” 

The answer I give them is, 
“Let the consumers consume 
themselves.” And then I show 
them the merchandising possibili- 
ties. The whole bit, right from 
history. How the morticians, a 
hundred years ago, proved that 
you could sell caskets with all 
kinds of fancy gadgets, including 
innerspring mattresses — even 
sell coffins for cremations. 

Then I give them the real 
angle, way back to the days of 
the Egyptians, who used to bury 
their bodies with a complete 
wardrobe of new clothing, all 
kinds of jewelry, household 
equipment, and furniture. 

And I even give them a slogan 
for their sales-campaigns — 
“You Can Take It With Yon.” 

They can see the sales-poten- 
108 


tial, but they’re still a little skep- 
tical about whether or not tire 
idea will catch on. So it’s up 
to me to prove that they’ll make 
a killing. 

September 12, 2047. The last 
^ six months have been murder. 

Figure of speech, of course. But 
I’ve been working myself to 
death. 

So much to do. Started with 
the funeral directors, setting up 
the campaign. Commercials. 

“Tired of high taxes? Trou- 
bled about illness, old age? Bills 
got you down? Time for a vaca- 
tion — now you can take the 
BIG Trip!” Lovely shots of cem- 
etery landscapes, soft hymn 
music in the background. 

The morticians have been 
helpful, I must say. They pitch 
the theme hard. “Now you can 
enjoy Permanent Retirement. Ask 
about our Layaway Plan.” 

It seems to be going over 
with the Senior Citizens, but 
we’ve got to get a gut-reaction 
from the younger set, too. May- 
be the cemeteries need jazzing- 
up. I’m going down to Washing- 
ton with a real-estate subsidy 
plan; we’ve got to get a lot of 
new land developments to pre- 
pare for the rush, and it isn’t 
just a matter of money. The 
whole concept has to be revita- 
lized. 

Statues and benches and sou- 
GALAXY 



venir-stands are good enough 
for tire old folks, but I’m target- 
ing at the kiddies. What we need 
are a few amusement-park touch- 
es; what I have in mind is some- 
thing on the order of Grisly- 
land .... 

jl/frarch 1, 2048. Just a little 
f fJ- over a year since I started, 
and it’s going over better than 
I’d ever hoped for. 

Even the wildest optimist 
would never have believed the 
national death-rate would jump 
80% in so short a time. And 
this is only the beginning! 

Right now I’d like to go on 
record congratulating the medi- 
cal profession — and, particular- 
ly, the psychiatrists and psych- 
ologists — for their cooperation 
and suggestions. 

Not only have they supported 
the new DeadiCare program; 
they’ve come up with some ideas 
I never would have known 
about. 

Almost all the psyches are con- 
centrating now on Thanatos, 
bringing out and encouraging the 
Death Wish in patients. Using 
suggestion and hypnosis, too ; 
not just in the asylums but in 
private practice. Since most peo- 
ple go for treatment because 
they’re already depressed, sick of 
crowds and smog and under- 
ground living and synthetic food 
and taxes and official forms and 
SALES OF A DEATHMAN 


regulations, it’s easy enough to 
work them into deep mel- 
ancholia. Government coopera- 
tion doesn’t hurt, either — next 
month the Pure Food and Drug 
Act amendment goes on the 
books and then we’ll have an- 
other assist. Free poison — for 
Home Use Only. 

The tricky bit, of course, is 
to make sure that people keep 
turning their aggressions inward; 
they’ve got to kill themselves, 
not murder others. But it seems 
to be working. Lots of things 
help. 

For example, the new art 
boom in death masks. Everybody 
wants one. I understand a lot of 
people with money are really 
going the whole Egyptian route 
— mummy-cases and all, or at 
least statues of themselves. 
There’s one down in Texas that’s 
fifty feet tall; built over the 
frame of an old oil derrick. 

Of course, as we expected, the 
biggest opposition came from the 
churches. We’ve had to make a 
big point of the fact that from 
now on death is strictly non- 
sectarian. And the insurance 
companies did a lot of beefing 
before DeadiCare; now they’re 
all switching over from life in- 
surance to death insurance — 
the perpetual care angle seems 
to work. 

I’m in Washington permanent- 
ly now. Full-time job, just one 

109 


thing after another, but I must 
say everybody pitches in to help. 
We’ve got the posters up — 
everything from “Join the 
Marine Corpse” to “Uncle Sam 
DOESN’T Want You!” And 
there’s a big publicity campaign 
for the development of Death 
Valley National Monument. 

/ \c taker 5 , 2051. Where does 
time go to? 

I couldn’t begin to set down 
what’s happened in the past 
three years, or so; all I know is 
that the official death rate for 
last year was 172,468,327. And 
this year started off with such 
a bang that we’re averaging 
twenty million a month. 

Never saw such prosperity. 
Half the country seems to be 
converted to cemeteries ■ — free- 
ways jammed with, funeral pro- 
cessions — factories can’t keep 
up with orders. Strain on natur- 
al resources, of course; we’re go- 
ing to have to do a. complete 
aboutface and campaign for sim- 
ple burials, with plastic coffins. 

But the big thing is we’ve got 
the youngsters. Everybody wants 
to fly to Vegas and play Rus- 
sian roulette. Even the kiddies 
get into the act — playing “un- 
dertaker” and burying their dolls. 
Or each other. And skipping rope 
to, “I-tisket, I-tasket, a green, 
and yellow casket.” 

I think our troubles are over. 
110 


7| / J r ay 22, 2052. I was wrong. 
If A Didn’t figure on the back- 
lash — Situation Overkill. 

Can’t blame it on the psyches. 
They did their best. But aggres- 
sion gets out of hand. Sure, the 
death rate keeps going up, but a 
lot of it is due to murders now. 
Not just the free poison, but as- 
sault with deadly weapons, etc. 
Lots of sex crimes, too, mostly 
necrophilia. 

Of course we’re in there pitch- 
ing. Setting up those Suicide 
Clubs (“If you don’t like your 
neighbor, why not urge him to 
join?”) and doing a big selling 
job on the sex angle, too, with 
the new Lovers’ Leaps; free ski- 
lifts to mountaintops and special 
high-rise jumps for city dwellers. 

But it isn’t enough. The 
churches aren’t helping. For a 
while we got them off on this 
ancestor-worship kick, but now 
they’re going too far. Understand 
there’s a lot of new cults around, 
based on human sacrifices. Bar- 
baric. 

Worst of all, it’s affecting busi- 
ness. With all this illegal murder 
going on, the mortality rate is 
climbing too high; getting out of 
control. Understand we’re down 
to 200,000,000 as of this year, 
and pretty soon there won’t be 
enough working population to 
keep up with the demands. 

I’m setting up a crisis confer- 
ence for June 1st. We’ve got to 

GALAXY 


pat some new life in our pro- 
gram. 

Sune 4th, 2052. Let’s face it — 
J we’re in trouble. 

The conference was a disaster. 
Every time I suggested a roll- 
back on our program, some 
damned psyche or other came up 
with an argument to prove it 
wouldn’t work — things have 
gone too far now. 

Of course I knew the idea had 
spread. If it wasn’t worldwide, 
this country would have been in- 
vaded long ago. But with other 
areas even more overpopulated 
than our own, I knew they’d 
copy us and our methods. And 
they have. 

The thing is (and this I didn’t 
know, until they filled us in at 
the conference) that the situation 
is even worse abroad. Death 
cults all over the place, religious 
fanatics, and what one of the 
psychiatrists called the “lemming 
urge.” Whole cities, whole sec- 
tions of a country, starting to 
march to the seashore, throwing 
themselves off cliffs. Mass hys- 
teria. 

“Heaven help us when it starts 
over here,” he said. “Can you im- 
agine what’s going to happen 
whe n the entire West Coast con- 
verges inland to jump off the 
edge of the Grand Canyon?” 

“So what do you suggest?” I 
asked. 

SALES OF A DEATHMAN 


He didn’t answer me. He 
couldn’t. Because as soon as he 
finished speaking, he’d gone over 
and jumped out of the win- 
dow .... 

J ~\ecember 1, 2058. 40,000. 

* ■ Not the mortality rate. 

That’s the official population 
figure for the entire country, as 
of today: 40,000. 

Don’t ask me how they arrived 
at the total. Living underground 
this way, I’m sure all they can 
do is guess. 

But at least, a few of us have 
survived. When you look at 
what’s happened, it’s amazing 
that there still are that many 
left. 

First the mass suicides, then 
the murder gangs, then the 
breakdown in industry and com- 
munications — pileups on the 
freeways, funeral services dis- 
rupted, casket industries shut 
down, cemeteries weeded-over 
and neglected. When the food 
factories went and the water 
desalinization plants stopped 
working, the end was in sight. 
Then they began to listen to our 
campaign again, but it was too 
late; no rallying point, no way 
to get people reorganized. We 
should have acted sooner, declar- 
ed martial law — but once the 
famine started and they began to 
drink that poisoned water from 
rivers and lakes, it was no use. 

Ill 


Virus and plague, that’s what did 
it in the end. And people run- 
ning wild — the new Steriliza- 
tion Cults coming in, nobody 
having babies any more. 

Of course the smog is gone, 
they tell me, but so is every- 
thing else. 

Here in the new Pentagon — 
Dead Center — we’re quite com- 
fortable. Plenty of food, plenty 
of supplies, all the comforts of 
home and a safe five levels un- 
derground. At least we can keep 
telecasting; we’ve got the facili- 
ties. But with an audience of 
only 40,000, I don’t know. 

Still, they say while there’s 
life, there’s hope .... 

pril 1, 2067. Running out of 
tape. 

Doesn’t really matter, because 
we’re running out of everything 
else, too. 

Eleven people left. 

That’s all. Eleven. 

Best medical care these past 
eight or nine years, but it doesn’t 
help. Underground living seems 
to lead inevitably to underground 
dying. And the surface is still 
deadly — virus everywhere. 

No more communication. None 
of us talk about it, but we all 
know the answer. Everybody’s 
gone, everywhere. We’re the last 
survivors. 


Six old men, all over seventy. 
Myself, forty-nine. Three elder- 
ly women. One girl, Rena Staf- 
ford, pretty blonde thing, about 
eighteen or so. 

Had another conference today, 
possibly the last one. Faced the 
facts. In a few years we’ll all be 
gone. Maybe the surface will 
clear, the virus will die out — 
but so will the human race. 

The president put it right on 
the line. (Funny thing, he really 
looks like Uncle Sam now, even 
without makeup). 

“We’re got to repopulate,” he 
said. “Start all over again from 
the beginning.” He looked at me. 
“You’re our only hope. You and 
the girl.” 

I nodded. So did she. 

So tonight they’re setting the 
two of us up in a living unit of 
our own. Regular honeymoon 
suite. From now on, it’s up to 
me. 

Too bad. I just don’t think 
I’m going to make it. I’ve come 
to the conclusion Thoreau was 
right. In times like these, one 
must seek the peaceful serenity 
of Walden Pond. 

I think I’ll go there tonight. 
And drown myself.

To solve the world's population crisis , 
they built a model world in a box — 
and filled it with a world's desperation! 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 


I 

4 CXTC That's that poem about 
’ ' ‘caverns measureless to 
man?’ ” Thomas Dixit asked. His 
voice echoed away among the 
caverns, the question unanswered. 
Peter Crawley, walking a pace or 
two behind him, said nothing, lost 
in a reverie of his own. 

It was over a year since Dixit 
had been imprisoned here. He 
had taken time off from the re- 
settlement area to come and have 
a last look round before every- 
thing was finally demolished. In 
these great concrete workings, 
men still moved — Indian tech- 
nicians mostly, carrying instru- 
ments, often with their own head- 


lights. Cables trailed everywhere; 
but the desolation was mainly 
an effect of the constant abrasion 
all surfaces had undergone. Peo- 
ple had flowed here like water in 
a subterranean cave; and their 
corporate life had flowed similar- 
ly, hidden, forgotten. 

Dixit was powerfully moved by 
the thought of all that life. He, 
almost alone, was the man who 
had plunged into it and survived. 

Old angers stirring in him, he 
turned and spoke directly to his 
companion. “What a monument 
to human suffering! They should 
leave this place standing as an 
everlasting memorial to what 
happened.” 

The white man said, “The Del- 


113 


hi government refuses to enter- 
tain any such suggestion. I see 
their point of view, but I also 
see that it would make a great 
tourist attraction!” 

“Tourist attraction, man! Is 
that all it means to you?” 

Crawley laughed. “As ever, 
you’re too touchy, Thomas. I 
take this whole matter much less 
lightly than you suppose. Tour- 
ism just happens to attract me 
more than human suffering.” 

They walked on side by side. 
They were never able to agree. 

The battered faces of flats and 
houses — now empty, once 
choked with humanity — stood 
on either side, doors gaping open 
like old men’s mouths in sleep. 
The spaces seemed enormous; the 
shadows and echoes that belong- 
ed to those spaces seemed to con- 
tinue indefinitely. Yet before . 
there had scarcely been room to 
breathe here. 

“I remember what your buddy. 
Senator Byrnes, said,” Crawley 
remarked. “He showed how both 
East and West have learned from 
this experiment. Of course, the 
social scientists are still working 
over their findings; some start- 
ling formulae for social groups 
are emerging already. But the 
people who lived and died here 
were fighting their way towards 
control of the universe of the ul- 
tra-small, and that’s where the 
biggest advances have come. 
114 


They were already developing 
power over their own genetic ma- 
terial. Another generation, and 
they might have produced the 
ultimate in automatic human 
population control: anoestrus, 

Where too close proximity to 
other members of the species 
leads to reabsorption of the em- 
bryonic material in the female. 
Our scientists have been able to 
help them there, and geneticists 
predict that in another decade — ” 

“Yes, yes, all that I grant you. 
Progress is wonderful.” He knew 
he was being impolite. These 
things were important, of revolu- 
tionary importance to a crowded 
earth. But he wished he walked 
these eroded passageways alone. 

Undeniably, India had learned 
too, just as Peter Crawley claim- 
ed. For Hinduism had been put 
to the test here and had shown 
its terrifying strengths and weak- 
nesses. In these mazes, people 
had not broken under deadly 
conditions — nor had they 
thought to break away from their 
destiny. Bharma — duty — had 
been stronger than humanity. 
And this revelation was already 
changing the thought and fate of 
one-sixth of the human race. 

He said, “Progress is wonder- 
ful. But what took place here 
was essentially a religious experi- 
ence.” 

Crawley’s brief laugh drifted 
away into the shadows of a great 

GALAXY 



gaunt stairwell. “I’ll bet you 
didn’t feel that way when we 
sent you in here a year ago!” 

What had he felt then? He 
stopped and gazed up at the 
gloom of the stairs. All that came 
to him was the memory of that 
appalling flood of life and of the 
people who had been a part of 
it, whose brief years had evapo- 
rated in these caverns, whose feet 
has endlessly trodden these war- 
ren-ways, these lugubrious decks, 
these crumbling flights ....

'T'he concrete steps climbed up 
into darkness. The steps 
were wide, and countless children 
sat on them, listless, resting 
against each other. This was an 
hour when activity was low and 
even small children hushed their 
cries for a while. Yet there was 
no silence on the steps; silence 
was never complete there. Al- 
ways, in the background, the 
noise of voices. Voices and more 
voices. Never silence. 

Shamim was aged, so she pre- 
ferred to run her errands at this 
time of day, when the crowds 
thronging Total Environment 
were less. She dawdled by a 
sleepy seller of life-objects at the 
bottom of the stairs, picking over 
the little artif acts and exclaiming 
now and again. The hawker knew 
her, knew she was too poor to 
116 


buy, did not even press her to 
buy. Shamim’s oldest daughter. 
Malti, waited for her mother by 
the bottom step. 

Malti and her mother were 
watched from the top of the 
steps. 

A light burned at the top of 
the steps. It had burned there for 
twenty-five years, safe from 
breakage behind a strong mesh. 
But dung and mud had recently 
been thrown at it, covering it al- 
most entirely and so making the 
top of the stairway dark. A fur- 
tive man called Narayan Farhad 
crouched there and watched, a 
shadow in the shadows. 

A month ago, Shamim had had 
an illegal operation in one of the 
pokey rooms off Grand Balcony 
on her deck. The effects of the 
operation were still with her; un- 
der her plain cotton sari, her 
thin dark old body was bent. Her 
share of life stood lower than it 
had been. 

Malti was her second oldest 
daughter, a meek girl who had 
not been conceived when the 
Total Environment experiment 
began. Even meekness had its 
limits. Seeing her mother dawdle 
so needlessly, Malti muttered im- 
patiently and went on ahead, 
climbing the infested steps, 
anxious to be home. 

E xtracts from Thomas Dixit’s 
report to Senator Jacob 

GALAXY 


Byrnes, back in America: To 
lend variety to the habitat, the 
Environment has been divided 
into ten decks, each deck five 
stories liigh, which allows for 
an occasional pocket-sized open 
space. The architecture has been 
varied somewhat on each deck. 
On one deck, a sort of blown-up 
Indian village is presented; on 
another, the houses are large and 
appear separate, although sand- 
wiched between decks — I need 
not add they are hopelessly over- 
crowded now. On most decks, the 
available space is packed solid 
with flats. Despite this attempt at 
variety, a general bowdlerization 
of both Eastern and Western 
architectural styles, and the fact 
that everything has been con- 
structed out of concrete or a 
parastyrene for economy’s sake, 
has led to a dreadful sameness. I 
cannot imagine anywhere more 
hostile to the spiritual values of 
life. 

The shadow in the shadows 
moved. He glanced anxiously up 
at the light, which also housed a 
spy-eye; there would be a warn- 
ing out, and sprays would soon 
squirt away the muck he had 
thrown at the fitting; but, for the 
moment, he could work un- 
observed. 

Narayan bared his old teeth as 
Malti came up the steps towards 
him, treading among the spraw- 

TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


ling children. She was too old to 
fetch a really good price on the 
slave market, but she was still 
strong; there would be no trouble 
in getting rid of her at once. Of 
course he knew something of her 
history, even though she lived on 
a different deck from him. Mal- 
ti! He called her name at the 
last moment as he jumped out 
on her. Old though he was, Na- 
rayan was quick. He wore only 
his dhoti, arms flashing, inter- 
locking round hers, one good 
powerful wrench to get her off 
her feet — now running fast, 
fearful, up the rest of the steps, 
moving even as he clamped one 
hand over her mouth to cut off 
her cry of fear. Clever old Na- 
rayan ! 

The stairs mount up and up in 
the four corners of the Total En- 
vironment, linking deck with 
deck. They are now crude things 
of concrete and metal, since the 
plastic covers have long been 
stripped from them. 

These stairways are the weak 
points of the tiny empires, transi- 
ent and brutal, that form on every 
deck. They are always guarded, 
though guards can be bribed. 
Sometimes gangs or “ unions ” 
take over a stairway, either by 
agreement or bloodshed. 

Shamim screamed, responding 
to her daughter’s cry. She began 

117 


to hobble up the stairs as fast as 
she could, tripping over infant 
feet, drawing a dagger out from 
under her sari. It was a plastic 
dagger, shaped out of a piece of 
the Environment. 

She called Malti, called for 
help, as she went. When s'he 
reached the landing, she was on 
the top floor of her deck, the 
Ninth, where she lived. Many 
people were here, standing, 
squatting, thronging together. 
They looked away from Shamim, 
people with blind faces. She had 
so often acted similarly herself 
when others were in trouble. 

Gasping, she stopped and star- 
ed up at the roof of the deck, 
blue- dyed to simulate sky, cracks 
running irregularly across it. The 
steps went on up there, up to 
Top Deck. She saw legs, yellow 
soles of feet disappearing, faces 
staring down at her, hostile. As 
she ran toward the bottom of the 
stairs, the watchers above threw 
things at her. A Shard hit Sham- 
kn’s cheek and cut it open. With 
blood running down her face, 
she began to wail. Then she turn- 
ed and ran through the crowds 
to her family room. 

J’ve been a month just reading 

through the microfiles. Some- 
times a whole deck becomes uni- 
fied under a strong leader. On 
Deck Nine, for instance, unifica- 
tion was achieved under a man 
118 


called U 11 has. He was a strong 
man, and a great show-off. That 
was a while ago, when conditions 
were not so desperate as they are 
now. Ullhas could never last the 
course today. Leaders become 
more despotic as Environment 
decays. 

The dynamics of unity are 
such that it is always insufficient 
for a deck simply to stay uni- 
fied; the young men always need 
to have their aggressions directed 
outwards. So the leader of a 
strong deck always sets out to 
tyrannize the deck below or 
above, whichever seems to be the 
weaker. It is a miserable state of 
affairs. The time generally comes 
when, in the midst of a raid, a 
counter-raid is launched by one 
of the other decks. Then the raid- 
ers return to carnage and defeat. 
And another paltry empire tum- 
bles. 

It is up to me to stop this con- 
tinual degradation of human life. 

As usual, the family room was 
crowded. Although none of 
Shamim’s own children were 
here, there were grandchildren — 
including the lame grand- 
daughter, Shirin — and six great- 
grandchildren, none of them more 
than three years old. Shamin’s 
third husband, Gita, was not in. 
Safe in the homely squalor of the 
room, Shamim burst into tears, 
while Shirin comforted her and 

GALAXY 


endeavored to keep the little ones 
off. 

“Gita is getting food. I will go 
and fetch him,” Sfairin said. 

When VH.DRE — Ultra-High 
Density Research Establishment 
— became operative , twenty-five 
years ago, all the couples select- 
ed for living in the Total En- 
vironment had to be under twenty 
years of age. Before being sealed 
in, they were inoculated against 
all diseases. There was plenty of 
room for each couple then; they 
had whole suites to themselves, 
and the best of food; plus no 
means of birth control. That’s 
always been the main pivot of 
the UHDRE experiment. Now, 
that first generation has aged 
severely. They are old people 
pushing forty-five. The whole 
life cycle has speeded up — 
early puberty, early senescence. 
The second and third generations 
have shown remarkable powers 
of adaptation; a fourth genera- 
tion is already toddling. Those 
toddlers will be reproducing be- 
fore their years attain double fig- 
ures, if present trends continue. 
Are allowed to continue. 

Gita was younger than Sham- 
im, a small wiry man who knew 
his way around. No hero, he 
nevertheless had a certain style 
about him. His life-object hung 
boldly round his neck on a chain, 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


instead of being hidden, as were 
most people’s life-objects. He 
stood in the line for food, chat- 
tering with friends. Gita was good 
at making alliances. 'With a 
bunch of his friends, he had 
formed a little union to see that 
they got their food back safely 
to their homes; so they generally 
met with no incident in the 
crowded walkways of Deck Nine. 

The balance of power on the 
deck was very complex at the 
moment. As a result, compara- 
tive peace reigned, and might 
continue for several weeks if the 
strong man on Top Deck did not 
interfere. 

TT'ood delivery grills ate fixed 
in the walls of every floor of 
every deck. Two gongs sound be- 
fore each delivery. After the sec- 
ond one, hatches open and steam- 
ing food pours from the grills. 
Hills of rice tumble forward, 
flavored with meat and spaces. 
Chapattis fall from a separate 
slot. As the men run forward 
with their containers, holy men 
are generally there to sanctify 
the food. 

Great supply elevators roar up 
and down in the heart of the ■ vast 
tower, tumbling out rations at all 
levels. Alcohol also was supplied 
in the early years. It was discon- 
tinued when it led to trouble; 
which is not to say that it is not 
secretly brewed inside the En- 

119 


vironment. The UHDRE food ra- 
tion has been generous from the 
start and has always been main- 
tained at the same level per head 
of population although, as you 
know, the food is now ninety-five 
per cent factory-made. Nobody 
would ever have starved, had it 
been shared out equably inside 
the tower. On some of the decks, 
some of the time, it is still shared 
out fairly. 

One of Gita’s sons, Jamsu, had 
seen the kidnapper Narayan 
making off to Top Deck with 
the struggling Malti. His eyes 
gleaming with excitement, he 
sidled his way into the queue 
where Gita stood and clasped his 
father’s arm. Jamsu had some- 
thing of his father in him, always 
lurked where numbers made him 
safe, rather than run off as his 
brothers and sisters had run off, 
to marry and struggle for a room 
of a space of their own. 

He was telling his father what 
had happened When Shirin limp- 
ed up and delivered her news. 

Nodding grimly, Gita said, 
“Stay with us, Shirin, while I get 
the food.” 

He scooped his share into the 
family pail. Jamsu grabbed a 
handful of rice for himself. 

“It was a dirty wizened man 
from Top Deck called Narayan 
Farhad,” Jamsu said, gobbling. 
“He is one of the crooks who 
120 


hangs about the shirt tails 
of . He let his voice die. 

“You did not go to Malti’s res- 
cue, shame on you!” Shirin said. 

“Jamsu might have been kill- 
ed,” Gita said, as they pushed 
through the crowd and moved 
towards the family room. 

“They’re getting so strong on 
Top Deck,” Jamsu said. “I hear 
all about it! We mustn’t provoke 
them or they may attack. They 
say a regular army is forming 
round . .” 

Shirin snorted impatiently. 
“You great babe! Go ahead and 
name the man! It’s Prahlad Patel 
whose very name you dare not 
mention, isn’t it? Is he a god or 
something, for Siva’s sake? 
You’re afraid of him even from 
this distance, eh, aren’t you?” 
“Don’t bully the lad,” Gita 
said. Keeping the peace in his 
huge mixed family was a great 
responsibility, almost more than 
he could manage. As he turned 
into the family room, he said 
quietly to Jamsu and Shirin, 
“Malti was a favorite daughter 
of Shamim’s, and now is gone 
from her. We will get our revenge 
against this Narayan Farhad. 
You and I will go this evening, 
Jamsu, to the holy man Vazifdar. 
He will even up matters for us, 
and then perhaps the great Patel 
will also be warned.” 

He looked thoughtfully down 
at his life-object. Tonight, he told 

GALAXY 


himself, I must venture forth 
alone and put my life in jeopar- 
dy for Shamin’s sake. 

T)rahlad Patel’s union has flour- 
*■ ished and grown until now 
he rules all the Top Deck. His 
name is known and dreaded, we 
believe, three or four decks down. 
He is the strongest — yet in 
some ways curiously the most 
moderate — ruler in Total En- 
vironment at present. 

Although he can be brutal, 
Patel seems inclined for peace. 
Of course, the bugging does not 
reveal everything; he may have 
plans which he keeps secret, since 
he is fully aware that the bug- 
ging exists. But we believe his 
interests lie in other directions 
than conquest. He is only about 
nineteen, as we reckon years, but 
already gray-haired, and the sight 
of him is said to freeze the mus- 
cles to silence in the lips of his 
followers. 1 have watched him 
over the bugging for many hours 
since I agreed to undertake this 
task. 

Patel has one great advantage 
in Total Environment. He lives 
on the Tenth Deck, at the top 
of the building. He can therefore 
be invaded only from below and 
the Ninth Deck offers no strong 
threats at present, being, mainly 
oriented round an influential 
body of holy men, of whom the 
most illustrious is one Vazifdat. 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


The staircases between decks 
are always trouble spots. No 
deck-ruler was ever strong 
enough to withstand attack from 
above and below. The staircases 
are also used by single trouble- 
makers, thieves, political fugi- 
tives, prostitutes, escaping slaves, 
hostages. Guards can always be 
bribed, or favor their multitu- 
dinous relations, or join the en- 
emy for one reason or another. 
Patel, being on the Top Deck, 
has only four weak points to 
watch for, rather than eight. 

Vazifdar was amazingly holy 
and amazingly influential. It was 
whispered that his life-object was 
the most intricate in all Environ- 
ment, but there was nobody who 
would lay claim to having set 
eyes upon it. Because of his repu- 
tation, many people on Gita’s 
deck — yes, and from farther 
away — sought Vazifdar’s help. A 
stream of men and women moved 
always through his room, even 
when he was locked in private 
meditation and far away from 
this world. 

The holy man had a flat with 
a balcony that looked out onto 
mid-deck. Many relations and 
disciples lived there with him, so 
that the rooms had been elabo- 
rately and flimsily divided by 
screens. All day, the youngest 
disciples twittered like birds up- 
on the balconies as Vazifdar held 

121 


court, discussing among them- 
selves the immense wisdom of his 
sayings. 

All the disciples, all the rela- 
tions, loved Vazifdar. There had 
been relations who did not love 
Vazifdar, but they had passed 
away in their sleep. Gita himself 
was a distant relation of Vazif- 
dar’s and came into the holy 
man’s presence now with gifts of 
fresh water and a long piece of 
synthetic cloth, enough to make 
a robe. 

Vazifdar’s brow and cheeks 
were painted with white to de- 
note his high caste. He received 
the gifts of cloth and water 
graciously, smiling at Gita in 
such a way that Gita — and, be- 
hind him, Jamsu — took heart. 

Vazifdar was thirteen years old 
as the outside measured years. 
He was sleekly fat, from eating 
much and moving little. His 
brown body shone with oils; 
every morning, young women 
massaged and manipulated him. 

He spoke very softly, husband- 
ing his voice, so that he could 
scarcely be heard for the noise 
in the room. 

“It is a sorrow to me that this 
woe has befallen your stepchild 
Malti,” he said. “She was a good 
woman, although infertile.” 

“She was raped at a very early 
age, disrupting her womb, dear 
Vazifdar. You will know of the 
event. Her parents feared she 
122 


would die. She could never bear 
issue. The evil shadowed her life. 
Now this second woe befalls her.” 

“I perceive that Malti’s role 
in the world was merely to be a 
companion to her mother. Not 
all can afford to purchase who 
visit the bazaar.” 

tT^here are bazaars on every 
floor, crowding down the cor- 
ridors and balconies, and a chief 
one on every deck. The menfolk 
chose such places to meet and 
chatter even when they have 
nothing to trade. Like everywhere 
else, the bazaars are crowded 
with humanity, down to the 
smallest who can walk — and 
sometimes even those carry naked 
smaller brothers clamped tight 
to their backs. 

The bazaars are great centers 
for scandal. Here also are our 
largest screens. They glow behind 
their safety grills, beaming in spe- 
cial programs from outside; our 
outside world that must seem 
to have but faint reality as it 
dashes against the thick securing 
walls of Environment and perco- 
lates through to the screens. Be- 
low the screens, uncheckable and 
fecund life goes teeming on, with 
all its injury. 

Humbly, Gita on his knees 
said, “If you could restore Malti 
to her mother Shamim, who 
mourns her, you would reap all 

GALAXY 


our gratitude, dear Vazifdar. 
Malti is too old for a man’s bed, 
and on Top Deck all sorts of 
humiliations must await her.” 

Vazifdar shook his head with 
great dignity. ‘‘You know I can- 
not restore Malti, my kinsman. 
How many deeds can be ever un- 
done As long as we have slav- 
ery, so long must we bear to 
have the ones we love enslaved. 
You must cultivate a mystical 
and resigned view of life and be- 
seech Shamim always to do the 
same.” 

“Shamim is more mystical in 
her ways than I, never asking 
much, always working, working, 
praying, praying. That is why she 
deserves better than this misery.” 

Nodding in approval of Sham- 
im’s behavior as thus revealed, 
Vazifdar said, “That is well. I 
know she is a good woman. In 
the future lie other events which 
may recompense her for this sad 
event.” 

Jamsu, who had managed to 
keep quiet behind his father un- 
til now, suddenly burst out, 
“Uncle Vazifdar, can you not 
punish Narayan Farhad for his 
sin in stealing poor Malti on 
the steps? Is he to be allowed 
to escape to Patel’s deck, there 
to live with Malti and enjoy?” 

“Sssh, son!” Gita looked in 
agitation to see if Jamsu’s out- 
burst had annoyed Vazifdar; but 
Vazifdar was smiling blandly. 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


“You must know, Jamsu, that 
we are all creatures of the Lord 
Siva, and without power. No, 
no, do not pout! I also am with- 
out power in his hands. To own 
one room is not to possess the 
whole mansion. But . .” 

It was a long and heavy but. 
When Vazifdar’s thick eyelids 
closed over his eyes, Gita trem- 
bled, for he recalled how, on pre- 
vious occasions when he had vis- 
ited his powerful kinsman, Vazif- 
dar’s eyelids had descended in 
this fashion while he deigned to 
think on a problem, as if he shut 
out all the external world with 
his own potent flesh. 

“Narayan Farhad shall be 
troubled by more than his con- 
science.” As he spoke, the pupils 
of his eyes appeared again, vio- 
let and black. They were looking 
beyond Gita, beyond the con- 
fines of his immediate surround- 
ings. “Tonight he shall be trou- 
bled by evil dreams.” 

“The night- visions!” Gita and 
Jamsu exclaimed, in fear and ex- 
citement. 

Now Vazifdar swiveled his 
magnificient head and looked 
directly at Gita, looked deep 
into his eyes. Gita was a small 
man; he saw himself as a small 
man within. He shrank still fur- 
ther under that irresistible scru- 
tiny. 

“Yes, the night-visions,” the 
holy man said. “You know what 

123 


that entails, Gita. You must go 
up to Top Deck and procure Na- 
rayan’s life-object. Bring it back 
to me, and I promise Narayan 
shall suffer the night-visions to- 
night. Though he is sick, he shall 
be cured.” 

Ill 

he women never cease their 
chatter as the lines of sup- 
plicants come and go before the 
holy men. Their marvelous resig- 
nation in that hateful prison! If 
they ever complain about more 
than the small circumstances of 
their lives, if they ever complain 
about the monstrous evil that has 
overtaken them all, I never heard 
of it. There is always the harm- 
less talk, talk that relieves petty 
nervous anxieties, talk that re- 
lieves the almost noticed pres- 
sures on the brain. The women’s 
talk practically drowns the noise 
of their children. But most of the 
time it is clear that Total En- 
vironment consists mainly of chil- 
dren. Thafs why I want to see 
the experiment closed down; the 
children would adapt to our 
world. 

It is mainly on this fourth 
generation that the effects of the 
population glut show. Whoever 
rules the decks, it is the babes, 
the endless babes, tottering, 
laughing, staring, piddling, tum- 
bling, running, the endless babes 
124 


to whom the Environment really 
belongs. And their mothers, for 
the most part, are women who — 
at the same age and in a more 
favored part of the globe — 
would still be virginally at school, 
many only just entering their 
teens. 

NTarayan Farhad wrapped a 

^ blanket round himself and 
huddled in his corner of the 
crowded room. Since it was al- 
most time to sleep, he had to 
take up his hired space before 
one of the loathed Dasguptas 
stole it. Narayan hated the Das- 
gupta family, its lickspittle men, 
its shrill women, its turbulent 
children — the endless babes 
who crawled, the bigger ones with 
nervous diseases who thieved 
and ran and jeered at him. It 
was the vilest family on Top 
Deck, according to Narayan’s oft- 
repeated claims; he tolerated it 
only because he felt himself to be 
vile. 

He succeeded at nothing to 
which he turned his hand. Only 
an hour ago, pushing through 
the crowds, he had lost his life- 
object from his pocket — or else 
it had been stolen; but he dared 
not even consider that possibili- 
ty! 

Even his desultory kidnapping 
business was a failure. This bitch 
he had caught this morning — 
Malti. He had intended to rape 

GALAXY 



her before selling her, but had 
become too nervous once he had 
dragged her in here, with a pair 
of young Dasguptas laughing at 
him. Nor had he sold the woman 
well. Patel had beaten down his 
price, and Narayan had not the 
guts to argue. Maybe he should 
leave this deck and move down 
to one of the more chaotic ones. 
The middle decks were always 
more chaotic. Six was having a 
slow three-sided war even now, 
which should make Five a fruit- 
ful place, with hordes of refugees 
to batten on. 

.... And what a fool to snatch 
so old a girl — . practically an 
old woman! 

Through narrowed eyes, Na- 
rayan squatted in his corner, acid 
flavors burning his mouth. Even 
if his mind would rest and allow 
him to sleep, the Dasgupta mob 
was still too lively for any real 
relaxation. That old Dasgupta, 
now — he was like a rat, totally 
without self-restraint, not a 
proper Hindu at all, doing the 
act openly with his own daugh- 
ters. There were many men like 
that in Total Environment, men 
who had nothing else in life. 
Dirty swine! Lucky dogs! Na- 
rayan’s daughters had thrown 
him out many months ago when 
he tried it! 

Over and over, his mind ran 
on his grievances. But he sat col- 
lectedly, prodding off with one 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


bare foot the nasty little brats 
who crawled at him, and staring 
at the screen flickering on the 
wall behind its protective mesh. 

He liked the screens, enjoyed 
viewing the madness of outside. 
What a world it was out there! 
All that heat, and the necessity 
for work, and the complication 
of life! The sheer bigness of the 
world — he couldn’t stand that, 
would not want it under any cir- 
cumstances. 

He did not understand half he 
saw. After all, he was born here. 
His father might have been bom 
outside, whoever his father was; 
but no legends from outside had 
come down to him : only the dis- 
tortions in the general gossip, and 
the stuff on the screens. Now 
that he came to reflect, people 
didn’t pay much attention to the 
screens any more. Even he didn’t. 

But he could not sleep. Bleari- 
ly, he looked at images of cattle 
ploughing fields, fields cut into 
dice by the dirty grills before the 
screens. He had already gathered 
vaguely that this feature was 
about changes in the world today. 

. are giving way to 
this . said the commentator 
above the rumpus in the Dasgup- 
ta room. The children lived here 
like birds. Racks were stacked 
against the walls, and on these 
rickety contraptions the many 
little Dasguptas roosted.

Yak yak yak, then. 

“Beef -tissue culture growing 
straight into plastic distribution 
packs . Shots of some great 
interior place somewhere, with, 
meat growing out of pipes,- ex- 
truding itself into square packs, 
dripping with liquid, looking 
rather ugly. Was that the shape 
of cows now or something? Out- 
side must be a hell of a scaring 
place, then! “. as new factory 
food at last spells hope for In- 
dia’s future in the . .” Yak yak 
yak from the kids. Once, their 
sleep racks had been built across 
the screen; but one night the 
whole shaky edifice collapsed, 
and three children were injured. 
None killed, worse luck! 

Patel should have paid more 
for that girl. Nothing was as good 
as it had been. Why, once on a 
time, they used to show sex films 
on the screens — really filthy 
stuff that got even Narayan ex- 
cited. He was younger then. 
Really filthy stuff, he remember- 
ed, and pretty girls doing it. But 
it must be — oh, a long time since 
that was stopped. The screens 
were dull now. People gave 
up watching. Uneasily, Narayan 
slept, propped in the comer under 
his scruffy blanket. Eventually, 
the whole scruffy room slept. 

T he documentaries and other 
features piped into Environ- 
126 


ment are no longer specially 
made by UHDRE teams tor in- 
ternal consumption. When the 
V.N. made a major cut in 
VHDRE’s annual subsidy, eight 
years ago, the private TV studio 
was one of the frills that had to 
be axed. Now we pipe in old pro- 
grams bought oft major networks. 
The hope is that they will keep 
the wretched prisoners in Envir- 
onment in touch with the outside 
world, but this is clearly not hap- 
pening. The degree of compre- 
hension between inside and out- 
side grows markedly less on both 
sides, on an exponential curve. 
As I see it, a great gulf of iso- 
lation is widening between the 
two environments, just as if they 
were sailing away from each other 
into different space-time contin- 
ua. 1 wish I could think that the 
people in charge here — Crawley 
especially — not only grasped 
this fact but understood that it 
should be rectified immediately. 

S hamim could not sleep for 
grief. 

Gita could not sleep for appre- 
hension. 

Jamsu could not sleep for ex- 
citement. 

Vazifdar did not sleep. 
Vazifdar shut his sacred self 
away in a cupboard, brought his 
lids down over his eyes and be- 
gan to construct, within the vast 
spaces of his mind, a thought 

GA1AXY 


pattern corresponding to the mat- 
rix represented by Narayan Far- 
had’s stolen life-object. When it 
was fully conceived, Vazifdar be- 
gan gently to inset a little evil 
into one edge of the thought-pat- 
tern .... 

Narayan slept. What roused 
him was the silence. It was the 
first time total silence had ever 
come to Total Environment. 

At first, he thought he would 
enjoy total silence. But it took on 
such weight and substance . 

Clutching his blanket, he sat 
up. The room was empty, the 
screen dark. Neither thing had 
ever happened before, could not 
happen! And the silence! Dear 
Siva, some terrible monkey god 
had hammered that silence out in 
darkness and thrown it out like 
a shield into the world, rolling 
over all things ! There was a ring- 
ing quality in the silence — a 
gong! No, no, not a gong! Foot- 
steps ! 

It was footsteps, O Lord Siva, 
do not let it be footsteps! 

Total Environment was empty. 
The legend was fulfilled that said 
Total Environment would empty 
one day. All had departed ex- 
cept for poor Narayan. And this 
thing of the footsteps was com- 
ing to visit him in his defenceless 
corner .... 

It was climbing up through the 
cellars of his existence. Soon it 
would emerge. 

TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


Trembling convulsively, Na- 
rayan stood up, clutching the 
corner of the blanket to his 
throat. He did not wish to face 
the thing. Wildly, he thought, 
could he bear it best if if looked 
like a man or if it looking noth- 
ing like a man? It was Death 
for sure — but how would it 
look? Only Death — his heart 
fluttered! — only Death could 
arrive this way .... 

His helplessness .... Nowhere 
to hide! He opened his mouth, 
could not scream, clutched the 
blanket, felt that he was wetting 
himself as if he were a child 
again. Swiftly came the image — 
the infantile, round-bellied, cring- 
ing, puny, his mother black with 
fury, her great white teeth grit- 
ting as she smacked his face with 
all her might, spitting .... It 
was gone, and he faced the gong- 
like death again, alone in the 
great dark tower. In the arid air, 
vibrations of its presence. 

He was shouting to it, demand- - 
ing that it did not come. 

But it came. It came with ma- 
jestic sloth, like the heartbeats 
of a foetid slumber, came in the 
door, pushing darkness before it. 

It was like a human, but too 
big to be human. 

And it wore Malti’s face, that 
sickeningly innocent smile with 
which she had run up the steps. 
No! No, that was not it — oh, he 
fell down onto the wet floor: it 

127 


was nothing like that woman, 
nothing at all. Cease, impossibili- 
ties! It was a man, his ebony skull 
shining, terrible and magnificent, 
stretching out, grasping, confi- 
dent. Narayan struck out in his 
extremity and fell forward. 
Death was another indelible 
smack in the face. 

One of the roosting Dasguptas 
blubbered and moaned as the 
man kicked him, woke for a mo- 
ment, saw the screen still flick- 
ering meaninglessly and reassur- 
ingly, saw Narayan tremble un- 
der his blanket, tumbled back 
into sleep. 

It was not till morning that 
they found it had been Na- 
rayan’s last tremble. 

I know I am supposed to be a 
detached observer. No emotions, 
no feelings. But scientific detach- 
ment is the attitude that has led 
to much of the inhumanity inher- 
ent in Environment. How do we, 
for all the bugging devices, hope 
to know what gastly secret night- 
mares they undergo in there? 
Anyhow, I am relieved to hear 
you are flying over. 

It is tomorrow I am due to go 
into Environment myself. 

IV 

T he central offices of UHDRE 
were large and repulsive. At 
the time when they and the Total 
128 


Environment tower had been 
built, the Indian Government 
would not have stood for any- 
thing else. Poured cement and 
rough edges was what they want- 
ed to see and what they got. 

From a window in the office 
building, Thomas Dixit could see 
the indeterminate land in one di- 
rection, and the gigantic TE 
tower in the other, together with 
the shantytown that had grown 
between the foot of the tower and 
the other UHDRE buildings. 

For a moment, he chose to 
ignore the Project Organizer be- 
hind him and gaze out at what 
he could see of the table-flat 
lands of the great Ganges delta. 

He thought, it’s as good a 
place as any for man to project 
his power fantasies. But you are 
a fool to get mixed up in all this, 
Thomas! 

Even to himself, he was never 
just Tom. 

I am being paid, well paid, to 
do a specific job. Now I am let- 
ting wooly humanitarian ideas 
get in the way of action. Essen- 
tially, I am a very empty man. 
No center. Father Bengali, 
mother English, and live all my 
life in the States. I have ex- 
cuses .... Other people accept 
them; why can’t I? 

Sighing, he dwelt on his own 
unsatisfactoriness. He did not 
really belong to the West, despite 
his long years there, and he cer- 

GALAXY 


tainly did not belong to India; in 
fact, he thought he rather dis- 
liked India. Maybe the best place 
for him was indeed the inside of 
the Environment tower. 

He turned impatiently and 
said “I’m ready to get going now, 
Peter.” 

Peter Crawley, the Special Pro- 
ject Organizer of UHDRE was a 
rather austere Bostonian. He re- 
moved the horn-rimmed glasses 
from his nose and said “Right! 
Although we have been through 
the drill many times, Thomas, I 
have to tell you this once again 
before we move. The entire — ” 
“Yes, yes, I know, Peter! You 
don’t have to cover yourself. This 
entire organization might be 
closed down if I make a wrong 
move. Please take it as read.” 
Without indignation, Crawley 
said, “I was going to say that we 
are all rooting for you. We ap- 
preciate the risks you are taking. 
We shall be checking you every- 
where you go in there through 
the bugging system.” 

“And whatever you see, you 
can’t do a thing.” 

“Be fair, we have made ar- 
rangements to help!” 

“I’m sorry, Peter.” He liked 
Crawley and Crawley’s descent 
reserve. 

Crawley folded his spectacles 
with a snap, inserted them in a 
leather slipcase and stood up. 

“The U.N., not to mention sub- 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


sidiary organizations like the 
WHO and the Indian govern- 
ment, have their knife into us, 
Thomas. They want to close us 
down and empty Environment. 
They will do so unless you can 
provide evidence that forms of 
extra-sensory perception are de- 
veloping inside the Environment. 
Don’t get yourself killed in there. 
The previous men we sent in be- 
haved foolishly and never came 
out again.” He raised an eyebrow 
and added dryly, “That sort of 
thing gets us a bad name, you 
know.” 

“Just as the blue movies did a 
while ago.” 

/Crawley put his hands behind 
his back. “My predecessor 
here decided that immoral 
movies piped in to Environment 
would help boost the birth rate 
there. Whether he was right or 
wrong, world opinion has chang- 
ed since then as the specter of 
world famine has faded. We 
stopped the movies eight years 
ago, but they have long memories 
at the U.N., I fear. They allow 
emotionalism to impede scientific 
research.” 

“Do you never feel any sympa- 
thy for the thousands of people 
doomed to live out their brief 
lives in the tower?” 

They looked speculatively at 
each other. 

“You aren’t on our side any 

129 


more, Thomas, are you? You’d 
like your findings to be negative, 
wouldn’t you, and have the U.N. 
close us down?” 

Dixit uttered a laugh. "I’m not 
on anyone’s side, Peter. I’m neu- 
tral. I’m going into Environment 
to look for the evidence of ESP 
that only direct contact may turn 
up. What else direct contact will 
turn up, neither of us can say as 
yet.” 

“But you think it will be 
misery. And you will emphasize 
that at the inquiry after your re- 
turn.” 

“Peter — let’s get on with it, 
shall we?” Momentarily, Dixit 
was granted a clear picture of the 
two of them standing in this 
room; he saw how their bodily 
attitudes contracted. His atti- 
tudes were rather slovenly; he 
held himself rather slump-shoul- 
dered, he gesticulated to some ex- 
tent (too much?); he was dress- 
ed in. threadbare tunic 'and shorts, 
ready to pass muster as an in- 
habitant of Environment. Craw- 
ley, on the other hand, was very 
upright, stiff and smart in his 
movements, hardly ever gestured 
as he spoke; his dress was fault- 
less. 

And there was no need to be 
awed by or envious of Crawley. 
Crawley was encased in inhibi- 
tion, afraid to feel, signaling his 
aridity to anyone who cared to 
look out from, their own self-pre- 
130 


occupation. Crawley, moreover, 
feared for his job. 

“Let’s get on. with it, as you 
say.” He came from behind his 
desk. “But I’d be grateful if you 
would remember, Thomas, that 
the people in the tower are 
volunteers, or the descendants of 
volunteers. 

“When UHDRE began, a 
quarter-century ago, back in 
the mid -nineteen-seventies, only 
volunteers were admitted to the 
Total Environment. Five hun- 
dred young married Indian cou- 
ples were admitted, plus what- 
ever children they had. The 
tower was a refuge then, free 
from famine, immune from all 
disease. They were glad, heartily 
glad, to get in, glad of all that 
Environment provided and still 
provides. Those who didn’t quali- 
fy rioted. We have to remember 
that. 

“India was a different place in 
1975. It had lost hope. One crisis 
after another, one famine after 
another, crops dying, people 
starving, and yet the population 
spiraling up by a million every 
month. 

“But today, thank God, that 
picture has largely changed. Syn- 
thetic foods have licked the prob- 
lem; we don’t need the grudging 
land any more. And at last the 
Hindus and Muslims have got the 
birth control idea into their heads. 
It’s only now, when a little hu~ 

GALAXY 


manity is seeping back into 
this death-bowl of a sub- 
continent, that the UN dares 
complain about the inhumanity 
of UHDRE.” 

D ixit said nothing. He felt that 
this potted history was simp- 
ly angled towards Crawley’s self- 
justification; the ideas it repre- 
sented were real enough, heaven 
knew, but they had meaning for 
Crawley only in terms of his own 
existence. Dixit felt pity and im- 
patience as Crawley went on with 
his narration. 

“Our aim here must be un- 
swervingly the same as it was 
from the start. We have evidence 
that nervous disorders of a spe- 
cial kind produce extra-sensory 
perceptions — telepathy and the 
rest, and maybe kinds of ESP we 
do not yet recognize. High-densi- 
ty populations with reasonable 
nutritional standards develop 
particular nervous instabilities 
which may be akin to ESP spec- 
tra. 

“The Ultra-High Density Re- 
search Establishment was set up 
to intensify the likelihood of 
ESP developing. Don’t forget 
that. The people in Environment 
are supposed to have some ESP; 
that’s the whole point of the 
operation, right? Sure, it is not 
humanitarian. We know that. 
But that is not your concern. 
You have to go in and find evi- 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


dence of ESP, something that 
doesn’t show over the bugging. 
Then UHDRE will be able to 
continue.” 

Dixit prepared to leave. “If it 
hasn’t shown up in quarter of a 
century — ” 

“It’s in there! I know it’s in 
there! The failure’s in the bug- 
ging system. I feel it coming 
through the screens at me — 
some mystery we need to get our 
hands on! If only I could prove 
it! If only I could get in there 
myself!” 

Interesting, Dixit thought. 
You’d have to be some sort of a 
voyeur to hold Crawley’s job, 
forever spying on the wretched 
people. 

“Too bad you have a white 
skin, eh?” he said lightly. He 
walked towards the door. It 
swung open, and he passed into 
the corridor. 

Crawley ran after him and 
thrust out a hand. “I know how 
you feel, Thomas. I’m not just a 
stuffed shirt, you know, not en- 
tirely void of sympathy. Sorry if 
I was needling you. I didn’t in- 
tend to do so.” 

Dixit dropped his gaze. “I 
should be the one to apologize, 
Peter. If there’s anything unus- 
ual going on in the tower, I’ll 
find it, never worry!” 

They shook hands, without 
wholly being able to meet each 
other’s eyes. 

131 



V 

I eaving the office block, Dixit 
*- J walked alone through the 
sunshine toward the looming 
tower that housed Total Envir- 
onment. The concrete walk was 
hot and dusty underfoot. The 
sun was the one good thing that 
India had, he thought: that burn- 
ing beautiful sun, the real ruler 
of India, whatever petty tyrants 
came and went. 

The sun blazed down on the 
tower; only inside did it not 
shine. 

The uncompromising outlines 
of the tower were blurred by 
pipes, ducts and shafts that ran 
up and down its exterior. It was 
a building built for looking into, 
not out of. Some time ago, in 
tlie bad years, the welter of 
visual records gleaned from En- 
vironment used to be edited and 
beamed out on global networks 
every evening; but all that had 
been stopped as conditions in- 
side Environment deteriorated, 
and public opinion in the demo- 
cracies, who were subsidizing 
the grandiose experiment, turned 
against the exploitation of human 
material. 

A monitoring station stood by 
the tower walls. From here, a 
constant survey on the interior 
was kept. Facing the station were 
the jumbles of merchants’ stalls, 
springing up to cater for tourists, 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


who persisted even now that the 
tourist trade was discouraged. 
Two security guards stepped 
forward and escorted Dixit to 
the base of the tower. With cere- 
mony, he entered the shade of 
the entry elevator. As he closed 
the door, germicides sprayed him, 
insuring that he entered Environ- 
ment without harboring danger- 
ous micro-organisms. 

The elevator carried him up to 
the top deck; this plan had been 
settled some while ago. The ele- 
vator was equipped with double 
steel doors. As it came to rest, a 
circuit opened, and a screen 
showed him what was happening 
on the other side of the doors. He 
emerged from a dummy air-con- 
ditioning unit, behind a wide pil- 
lar. He was in Patel’s domain. 

nphe awful weight of human 
overcrowding hit Dixit with 
its full stink and noise. He sat 
down at the base of the pillar and 
let his senses adjust. And he 
thought, I was the wrong one to 
send; I’ve always had this inner 
core of pity for the sufferings of 
humanity; I could never be im- 
partial; I’ve got to see that this 
terrible experiment is stopped. 

He was at one end of a long 
balcony on to which many doors 
opened; a ramp led down at the 
other end. All the doorways 
gaped, although some were 
covered by rugs. Most of the 

133 


doors had been taken off their 
hinges to serve as partitions 
along the balcony itself, parti- 
tioning off overspill families. 
Children ran everywhere, their 
tinkling voices and cries the 
dominant note in the hubbub. 
Glancing over the balcony, Dixit 
took in a dreadful scene of 
swarming multitudes, the an- 
onymity of congestion; to sor- 
row for humanity was not to love 
its prodigality. Dixit had seen 
this panorama many times over 
the bugging system; he knew all 
the staggering figures — 1500 
people in here to begin with, and 
by now some 75,000 people, a 
large proportion of them under 
four years of age. But pictures 
and figures were pale abstracts 
beside the reality they were in- 
tended to represent. 

The kids drove him into ac- 
tion at last by playfully hurling 
dirt at him. Dixit moved slowly 
along, carrying himself tight and 
cringing in the manner of the 
crowd about him, features rigid, 
elbows tucked in to the ribs. 
Mutatis mutandis, it was Craw- 
ley’s inhibited attitude. Even the 
children ran between the legs of 
their elders in that guarded way. 
As soon as he had left the shel- 
ter of his pillar, he was caught 
in a stream of chattering people, 
all jostling between the rooms 
and the stalls of the balcony. 
They moved very slowly. 

134 


Among the crowd were hawk- 
ers, and salesmen pressed their 
wares from the pitiful balcony 
hovels. Dixit tried to conceal his 
curiosity. Over the bugging he 
had not only distant views of the 
merchandise offered for sale. 
Here were the strange models 
that had caught his attention 
when he was first appointed to 
the UHDRE project. A man with 
orange goateyes, in fact probably 
no more than thirteen years of 
age, but here a hardened veteran, 
was at Dixit’s elbow. As Dixit 
stared at him, momentarily sus- 
picious he was being watched, 
the goat-eyed man merged into 
the crowd; and, to hide his face, 
Dixit turned to the nearest sales- 
man. 

In only a moment, he was 
eagerly examining the wares, for- 
getting how vulnerable was his 
situation. 

All the strange models were ex- 
tremely small. This Dixit attri- 
buted to shortage of materials — 
wrongly, as it later transpired. 
The biggest model the salesman 
possessed stood no more than 
two inches high. It was made, 
nevertheless, of a diversity of 
materials, in which many sorts 
of plastics featured. Some 
models were simple, and ap- 
peared to be little more than an 
elaborate tughra or monogram, 
which might have been intended 
for an elaborate piece of costume 

GALAXY 


jewelry; others, as one peered 
among their interstices, seemed to 
afford a glimpse of another di- 
mension; all possessed eye-teasing 
properties. 

T he merchant was pressing 
Dixit to buy. He referred to 
the elaborate models as “life-ob- 
jects.” Noticing that one in par- 
ticular attracted his potential 
customer, he lifted it delicately 
and held it up, a miracle of 
craftsmanship, perplexing, outre, 
giving Dixit somehow as much 
pain as pleasure. He named a 
price. 

Although Dixit was primed 
with money, he automatically 
shook his head. “Too expensive.” 
“See, master, I show you how 
this life-object works!” The man 
fished beneath his scrap of loin- 
cloth and produced a small per- 
forated silver box. Flipping it 
open, he produced a live wood- 
louse and slipped it under a 
hinged part of the model. The 
insect, in its struggles, activated a 
tiny wheel; the interior of the 
model began to rotate, some sets 
of minute planes turning in coun- 
terpoint to others. 

“This life-object belonged to a 
very religious man, master.” 

In his fascination, Dixit said, 
“Are they all powered?” 

“No, master, only special ones. 
This was perfect model from 
Dalcush Bancholi, last genera- 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


tion master all the way from 
Third Deck, very very fine and 
masterful workmanship of first 
quality. I have also still better 
one worked by a body louse, if 
you care to see.” 

By reflex, Dixit said, “Youc 
prices are too high.” 

He absolved himself from the 
argument that brewed, slipping 
away through the crowd with the 
merchant calling after him. Other 
merchants shouted to him, sens- 
ing his interest in their wares. 
He saw some beautiful work, all 
on the tiniest scale and not only 
life-objects but amazing little 
watches with millisecond hands 
as well as second hands; in some 
cases, the millisecond was the 
largest hand; in some, the hour 
hand was missing or was supple- 
mented by a day hand; and the 
watches took many extraordinary 
shapes, tetrakishexahedrons and 
other elaborate forms, until their 
format merged with that of the 
lif e-objects. 

Dixit thought approvingly: the 
clock and watch industry fulfills 
a human need for exercising ela- 
borate skill and accuracy, while 
at the same time requiring a 
minimum of materials. These 
people of Total Environment are 
the world’s greatest craftsmen. 
Bent over one curious watch that 
involved a color change, he 
became suddenly aware of 
danger. Glancing over his shoul- 

135 


der, he saw the man with the un- 
pleasant orange eyes about to 
strike him. Dixit dodged without 
being able to avoid the blow. 
As it caught him on the side 
of his neck, he stumbled and 
fell under the milling feet. 

VI 

\ fterwards, Dixit could hardly 
say that he had been totally 
unconscious. He was aware of 
hands dragging him, of being 
partly carried, of the sound of 
many voices, of the name “Patel” 
repeated .... And when he 
came fully to his senses, he was 
lying in a cramped room, with a 
guard in a scruffy turban stand- 
ing by the door. His first hazy 
thought was that the room was 
no more than a small ship’s 
cabin; then he realized that, by 
indigenous standards, this was a 
large room for only one person. 

He was a prisoner in Total En- 
vironment. 

A kind of self-mocking fear en- 
tered him; he had almost ex- 
pected the blow, he realized; 
and he looked eagerly about for 
the bug-eye that would reassure 
him his UHDRE friends outside 
were aware of his predicament. 
There was no sign of the bug- 
eye. He was not long in working 
out why; this room had been 
partitioned out of a larger one, 
and the bugging system was evi- 
136 


dently shut in the other half — 
whether deliberately or acciden- 
tally, he had no way of knowing. 

The guard had bobbed out 
of sight. Sounds of whispering 
came from beyond the doorway. 
Dixit felt the pressure of many 
people there. Then a woman 
came in and closed the door. 
She walked cringingly and car- 
ried a brass cup of water. 

Although her face was lined, 
it was possible to see that she had 
once been beautiful and perhaps 
proud. Now her whole attitude 
expressed the defeat of her life. 
And this woman might be no 
more than eighteen! One of the 
terrifying features of Environ- 
ment was the way, right from the 
start, confinement had speeded 
life-processes and abridged life. 

Involuntarily, Dixit flinched 
away from the woman. 

She almost smiled. “Do not 
fear me, sir. I am almost as 
much a prisoner as you are. 
Equally, do not think that by 
knocking me down you can es- 
cape. I promise you, there are 
fifty people outside the door, all 
eager to impress Prahlad Patel 
by catching you, should you try 
to get away.” 

So I’m in Patel’s clutches, he 
thought. Aloud he said, “I will 
offer you no harm. I want to see 
Patel. If you are captive, tell me 
your name, and perhaps I can 
help you.” 


GALAXY 


As she offered him the cup and 
he drank, die said, shyly, “I do 
not complain, for my fate might 
have been much worse than it is. 
Please do not agitate Patel about 
me, or he may throw me out of 
his household. My name is Mal- 
ti, perhaps I may be able to help 
you, and all your tribe, soon. 
You are all in a form of cap- 
tivity here, the great Patel in- 
cluded, and it is from that I 
hope to deliver you.” 

Then he saw fear in her eyes. 

‘‘You really are a spy from 
outside!” she breathed. “But we 
do not want our poor little 
world invaded! You have so 
much — leave us our little!” She 
shrank away and slipped through 
the door, leaving Dixit with a 
melancholy impression of her 
eyes, so burdened in their shrun- 
ken gaze. 

nphe babel continued outside 
the door. Although he still 
felt sick, he propped himself up 
and let his thoughts run on. “You 
have so much — leave us our 
little . .” All their values had 
been perverted. Poor things, they 
could know neither the smallness 
of their own world, nor the mag- 
nitude of the world outside. This 
— this dungheap had become to 
them all there was of beauty and 
value. 

Two guards came for him, 
mere boys. He could have 

TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


knocked their heads together, 
but compassion moved him. They 
led him through a room full of 
excited people; beyond their 
glaring faces, the screen flickered 
pallidly behind its mesh; Dixit 
saw how faint the image of out- 
side was. 

He was taken into another par- 
titioned room. Two men were 
talking. 

The scene struck Dixit with 
peculiar force, and not merely 
because he was at a disadvan- 
tage. 

It was an alien scene. The im- 
poverishment of even the rich- 
est furnishings, the clipped and 
bastardized variety of Hindi that 
was being talked, reinforced title 
impression of strangeness. And 
the Charge of Patel’s character 
filled the room. 

There could be no doubt who 
was Patel. The plump cringing 
fellow, wringing his hands and 
protesting, was not Patel. Patel 
was the stocky white-haired man 
with the heavy lower lip and 
high forehead. Dixit had seen 
him in this very room over the 
bugging system. But to stand 
captive awaiting his attention 
was an experience of an entirely 
different order. Dixit tried to an- 
alyze the first fresh impact 
Patel had' on him, but it was elu- 
sive. 

It was difficult to realize that, 
as the outside measured years, 

137 


Patel could not be much more 
than nineteen or twenty years of 
age. Time was impacted here, 
jellified under the psychic pres- 
sures of Total Environment. 
Like the hieroglyphics of that 
new relativity, detailed plans of 
the Environment hung large on 
one wall of this room, while fig- 
ures and names were chalked 
over the others. The room was the 
nerve center of Top Deck. 

He knew something about 
Patel from the UHDRE records. 
Patel had come up here from the 
Seventh Deck. By guile as well 
as force, he had become ruler of 
Top Deck at an early age. He 
had surprised UHDRE observ- 
ers by abstaining from the usual 
forays of conquest into other 
floors. 

Patel was saying to the cring- 
ing man, “Be silent! You try to 
obscure the truth with argument. 
You have heard the witnesses 
against you. During your period 
of watch on the stairs, you were 
bribed by a man from Ninth 
Deck and you let him through 
here.” 

“Only for a mere seventeen 
minutes, Sir Patel!!” 

“I am aware that such things 
happen every day, wretched 
Raital. But this fellow you let 
through stole the life-object be- 
longing to Narayan Farhad and, 
in consequence, Narayan Far- 
had died in his sleep last night. 
138 


Narayan was no more important 
than you are, but he was useful 
to me, and it is in order that he 
be revenged.” 

“Anything that you say, Sir 
Patel!” 

“Be silent, wretched Raital!” 
Patel watched Raital with inter- 
est as he spoke. And he spoke 
in a firm reflective voice that 
impressed Dixit more than shout- 
ing would have done. 

“You shall revenge Narayan, 
Raital, because you caused his 
death. You will leave here now. 
You will not be punished. You 
will go, and you will steal the 
life-object belonging to that fel- 
low from whom you accepted the 
bribe. You will bring that life- 
object to me. You have one day 
to do so. Otherwise, my assas- 
sins will find you out wherever 
you hide, be it even down on 
Deck One.” 

“Oh, yes, indeed, Sir Patel, all 
men know — ” Raital was bent 
almost double as he uttered some 
face-saving formula. He turned 
and scurried away as Patel dis- 
missed him. 

Strength, thought Dixit. 
Strength, and also cunning. That 
is what Patel radiates. An elabo- 
rate and cutting subtlety. The 
phrase pleased him, seeming to 
represent something actual that 
he had detected in Patel’s make- 
up. An elaborate and cut- 
ting subtlety. 


GALAXY 


Clearly, it was part of Patel’s 
design that Dixit should witness 
this demonstration of his meth- 
ods. 

Patel turned away, folded his 
arms, and contemplated a blank 
piece of wall at close range. He 
stood motionless. The guards 
held Dixit still, but not so still as 
Patel held himself. 

nphis tableau was maintained 
for several minutes. Dixit 
found himself losing track of the 
normal passage of time. Patel’s 
habit of turning to stare at the 
wall — and it did not belong to 
Patel alone — was an uncanny 
one that Dixit had watched sev- 
eral times over the bugging sys- 
tem. It was that habit, he 
thought, which might have given 
Crawley the notion that ESP 
was rampant in the tower. 

It was curious to think of 
Crawley here. Although Crawley 
might at this moment be survey- 
ing Dixit’s face on a monitor, 
Crawley was now no more than 
an hypothesis. 

Malti broke the tableau. She 
entered the room with a damp 
cloth on a tray, to stand waiting 
patiently for Patel to notice her. 
He broke away at last from his 
motionless survey of the wall, 
gesturing abruptly to the guards 
to leave. He took no notice of 
Dixit, sitting in a chair, letting 
Malti drape the damp cloth 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


round his neck; the cloth had a 
fragrant smell to it. 

“The towel is not cool enough, 
Malti, or damp enough. You will 
attend to me properly at my 
morning session, or you will lose 
this easy job.” 

He swung his gaze, which was 
suddenly black and searching, on 
to Dixit to say, “Well, spy, you 
know I am Lord here. Do you 
wonder why I tolerate old 
women like this about me when 
I could have girls young and 
lovely to fawn on me?” 

Dixit said nothing, and 
the self-styled Lord continued, 
“Young girls would merely re- 
mind me by contrast of my ad- 
vanced years. But this old bag 
— whom I bought only yester- 
day — this old bag is only just 
my junior and makes me look 
good in contrast. You see, we 
are masters of philosophy in 
here, in this prison-universe; we 
cannot be masters of material 
wealth like you people outside!” 

Again Dixit said nothing, dis- 
gusted by the man’s implied at- 
titude to women. 

A swinging blow caught him 
unprepared in the stomach. He 
cried and dropped suddenly to 
the floor. 

“Get up, spy!” Patel said. He 
had moved extraordinarily fast. 
He sat back again in his chair, 
letting Malti massage his neck 
muscles. 

139 


VII 

i A s Dixit staggered to his feet, 
Patel said, “You don’t deny 
you are from outside?” 

“I did not attempt to deny it. 
I came from outside to speak to 
you.” 

“You say nothing here until 
you are ordered to speak. Your 
people — you outsiders — you 
have sent in several spies to us 
in the last few months. Why?” 
Still feeling sick from the blow, 
Dixit said, “You should realize 
that we are your friends rather 
than your enemies, and our men 
emissaries rather than spies.” 
“Pah! You are a breed of spies! 
Don’t you sit and spy on us 
from every room? You live in a 
funny little dull world out there, 
don’t you? So interested in us 
that you can think of nothing 
else! Keep working, Malti! Little 
spy, you know what happened 
to all the other spies your spying 
people sent in?” 

“They died,” Dixit said. 
“Exactly. They died. But you 
are the first to be sent to Patel’s 
deck. What different thing to 
death do you expect here?” 
“Another death will make my 
superiors very tired, Patel. You 
may have the power of life and 
death over me; they have the 
same over you, and over all in 
this world of yours. Do you want 
a demonstration?” 

140 


Rising, flinging the towel off, 
Patel said, “Give me your dem- 
onstration !” 

Must do, Dixit thought. Star- 
ing in Patel’s eyes, he raised his 
right hand above his head and 
gestured with his thumb. Pray 
they are watching — and thank 
God this bit of partitioned room 
is the bit with the bugging sys- 
tem! 

Tensely, Patel stared, balanced 
on his toes. Behind his shoulder, 
Malti also stared. Nothing hap- 
pened. 

Then a sort of shudder ran 
through Environment. It became 
slowly audible as a mixture of 
groan and cry. Its cause became 
apparent in this less crowded 
room when the air began to grow 
hot and foul. So Dixit’s signal 
had got through; Crawley had 
him under survey, and the air- 
conditioning plant was pumping 
in hot carbon-dioxide through the 
respiratory system. 

“You see? We control the 
very air you breathe!” Dixit said. 
He dropped his arm, and slowly 
the air returned to normal, al- 
though it was at least an hour 
before the fright died down in 
the passages. 

Whatever the demonstration 
had done to Patel, he showed 
nothing. Instead, he said, “You 
control the air. Very well. But 
you do not control the will to 
turn it off permanently — and 

GALAXY 




so you do not control the air. 
Your threat is an empty one, 
spy! For some reason, you need 
us to live. We have a mystery, 
don’t we?” 

“There is no reason why I 
should be anything but honest 
with you, Patel. Your special en- 
vironment must have bred special 
talents in you. We are interested 
in those talents; but no more 
than interested.” 

Patel came closer and inspect- 
ed Dixit’s face minutely, rather 
as he had recently inspected 
the blank wall. Strange angers 
churned inside him; his neck and 
throat turned a dark mottled 
color. Finally he spoke. 

“We are the center of your 
outside world, aren’t we? We 
know that you watch us all the 
time. We know that you are 
much more than ‘interested!’ For 
you, we here are somehow a mat- 
ter of life and death, aren’t we?” 

nphis was more than Dixit had 
expected. 

“Four generations, Patel, four 
generations have been incar- 
cerated in Environment.” His 
voice trembled. “Four genera- 
tions, and, despite our best in- 
tentions, you are losing touch 
with reality. You live in one re- 
latively small building on a size- 
able planet. Clearly, you can 
only be of limited interest to the 
world at large.” 

142 


“Malti!” Patel turned to the 
slave girl. “Which is the greater, 
the outer world or ours?” 

She looked confused, hesitated 
by the door as if longing to es- 
cape. “The outside world was 
great, master, but then it gave 
birth to us, and we have grown 
and are growing and are gaining 
strength. The child now is al- 
most the size of the father. So 
my step-father’s son Jamsu says, 
and he is a clever one.” 

Patel turned to stare at Dixit, 
a haughty expression on his face. 
He made no comment, as if the 
words of an ignorant girl were 
sufficient to prove his point. 

“All that you and the girl say 
only emphasizes to me how 
much you need help, Patel. The 
world outside is a great and thriv- 
ing place; you must allow it to 
give you assistance through me. 
We are not your enemies.” 
Again the choleric anger was 
there, powering Patel’s every 
word. 

“What else are you, spy? Your 
life is so vile and pointless out 
there, is it not? You envy us 
because we are superseding you! 
Our people — we may be poor, 
you may think of us as in your 
power, but we rule our own uni- 
verse. And that universe is ex- 
panding and falling under our 
control more every day. Why, 
our explorers have gone into the 
world of the ultra-small. We dis- 

GALAXY 


cover new environments, new 
ways of living. By your terms, 
we are scientific peasants, per- 
haps, but I fancy we have ways 
of knowing the trade routes of 
the blood and the eternities of 
cell-change that you cannot com- 
prehend. You think of us all as 
captives, eh? Yet you are cap- 
tive to the necessity of supplying 
our air and our food and water; 
we are free. We are poor, yet you 
covet our riches. We are spied 
orf all the time, yet we are secret. 
You need to understand us, yet 
we have no need to understand 
you. You are in out power, spy!” 

“Certainly not in one vital re- 
spect, Patel. Both you and we 
are ruled by historical necessity. 
This Environment was set up 
twenty-five of our years ago. 
Changes have taken place not 
only in here but outside as well. 
The nations of the world are no 
longer prepared to finance this 
project. It is going to be closed 
down entirely, and you are going 
to have to live outside. Or, if 
you don’t want that, you’d better 
cooperate with us and persuade 
the leaders of the other decks to 
cooperate.” 

Would threats work with 
Patel? His hooded and oblique 
gaze bit into Dixit like a hook. 

After a deadly pause, he 
clapped his hands once. Two 
guards immediately appeared. 

“Take the spy away,” said 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


Patel. Then he turned his back. 

\ clever man, Dixit thought. 

He sat alone in the cell and 
meditated. 

It seemed as if a battle of wits 
might develop between him and 
Patel. Well, he was prepared. He 
trusted to his first impression, 
that Patel was a man of cutting 
subtlety. He could not be taken 
to mean all that he said. 

Dixit’s mind worked back 
over their conversation. The 
mystery of the lif e-objects had 
been dangled before him. And 
Patel had taken care to belittle 
the outside world: “funny dull 
little world,” he had called it. 
He had made Malti advance her 
primitive view that Environ- 
ment was growing, and that had 
fitted in very well with his brand 
of boasting. Which led to the 
deduction that he had known 
her views beforehand; yet he 
had bought her only yesterday. 
Why should a busy man, a lead- 
er, bother to question an ignor- 
ant slave about her views of 
the outside world unless he were 
starved for information of that 
world, obsessed with it?”” 

Yes, Dixit nodded to himself. 
Patel was obsessed with outside 
and tried to hide that obsession; 
but several small contradictions 
in his talk had revealed it. 

Of course, it might be that 
Malti was so generally represen- 

143 


tative of the thousands in En- 
vironment that her misinformed 
ideas could be taken for granted. 
It was as well, as yet, not to 
be too certain that he was be- 
ginning to understand Patel. 

Part of Patel’s speech made 
sense even superficially. These 
poor devils were exploring the 
world of the ultra-small. It was 
the only landscape left for them 
to map. They were human, and 
still burning inside them was that 
unquenchable human urge to 
open new frontiers. 

So they knew some inward 
things. Quite possibly, as Craw- 
ley anticipated, they possessed a 
system of ESP upon which some 
reliance might be placed, unlike 
the wildly fluctuating telepathic 
radiations which circulated in the 
outside world. 

He felt confident, fully engag- 
ed. There was much to under- 
stand here. The bugging system, 
elaborate and over-used, was 
shown to be a complete failure; 
the watchers had stayed external 
to their problem; it remained 
their problem, not their life. 
What was needed was a whole 
team to come and live here, per- 
haps a team on every deck, an- 
thropologists and so on. Since 
that was impossible, then clearly 
the people of Environment must 
be released from their captivity; 
those that were unwilling to go 
far afield should be settled in 
144 


new villages on the Ganges plain, 
under the wide sky. And there, 
as they adapted to the real world, 
observers could live among them, 
learning with humility of the 
gifts that had been acquired at 
such cost within the thick walls 
of the Total Environment tower. 

As Dixit sat in meditation, a 
guard brought a meal in to him. 

He ate thankfully and renew- 
ed his thinking. 

From the little he had already 
experienced — the ghastly pres- 
sures on living space, the slavery, 
the aberrant modes of thought 
into which the people were be- 
ing forced, the harshness of the 
petty rulers — he was confirmed 
in his view that this experiment 
in anything like its present form 
must be closed down at once. 
The U.N. needed the excuse of 
his adverse report before they 
moved; they should have it 
when he got out. And if he word- 
ed the report carefully, stressing 
that these people had many 
talents to offer, then he might 
also satisfy Crawley and his like. 
He had it in his power to satisfy 
all parties, when he got out. All 
he had to do was get out. 

The guard came back to collect 
his empty bowl. 

“When is Patel going to speak 
with me again?” 

The guard said, “When he 
sends for you to have you 
silenced for ever.” 


GALAXY 


Dixit stopped composing his 
report and thought about that in- 
stead. 

VIII 

A yT uch time elapsed before 
IV i p)i x it was visited again, and 
then it was only the self-effacing 
Malti who appeared, bringing 
him a cup of water. 

“I want to talk to you,” Dixit 
said urgently. 

“No, no, I cannot talk! He 
will beat me! It is the time when 
we sleep, when the old die. You 
should sleep now, and Patel will 
see you in the morning.” 

He tried to touch her hand, 
but she withdrew. 

“You are a kind girl, Malti. 
You suffer in Patel’s household.” 

“He has many women, many 
servants. I am not alone.” 

“Can you not escape back to 
your family?” 

She looked at the floor eva- 
sively. “It would bring trouble 
to my family. Slavery is the lot 
of many women. It is the way 
of the world.” 

“It is not the way of the world 
I come from!” 

Her eyes flashed. “Your world 
is of no interest to us!” 

Dixit thought after she had 
gone, She is afraid of our world. 
Rightly. 

He slept little during the night. 
Even barricaded inside Patel’s 

TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


fortress, he could still hear the 
noises of Environment: not only 
the voices, almost never silent, 
but the gurgle and sob of pipes 
in the walls. In the morning, he 
was taken into a larger room 
where Patel was issuing com- 
mands for the day to a succes- 
sion of subordinates. 

Confined to a corner, Dixit 
followed everything with inter- 
est. His interest grew when the 
unfortunate guard Raital appear- 
ed. He bounded in and waited 
for Patel to strike him. Instead, 
Patel kicked him. 

“You have performed as I or- 
dered yesterday?” 

Raital began at once to cry 
and wring his hands. “Sir Patel, 
I have performed as well as and 
better than you demanded, in- 
curring great suffering and hav- 
ing myself beaten downstairs 
where the people of Ninth Deck 
discovered me marauding. You 
must invade them, Sir, and teach 
them a lesson that in their insol- 
ence they so dare to mock your 
faithful guards who only do those 
things — ” 

“Silence, you dog-devourer! 
Do you bring back that item 
which I demanded of you yes- 
terday?” 

The wretched guard brought 
from the pocket of his tattered 
tunic a small object, which he 
held out to Patel. 

“Of course I obey, Sir Patel. 

145 


To keep this object safe when 
the people caught me, I swallow 
it whole, sir, into the stomach 
for safe keeping, so that they 
would not know What I am 
about. Then my wife gives me 
sharp medicine so that I vomit 
it safely again to deliver to you.” 

“Put the filthy thing down on 
that shelf there! You think I 
wish to touch it when it has been 
in your worm-infested belly, 
slave?” 

The guard did as he was bid 
and abased himself. 

“You are sure it is the life- 
object of the man who stole Na- 
rayan Farhad’s life-object, and 
nobody else’s?” 

“Oh, indeed, Sir Patel! It be- 
longs to a man called Gita, the 
very very same who stole Na- 
rayan’s life-object, and tonight 
you will see he will die of night- 
visions!!” 

“Get out!” Patel managed to 
catch Raital’s buttocks with a 
swift kick as the guard scamper- 
ed from the room. 

A queue of people stood waiting 
to speak with him, to sup- 
plicate and advise. Patel sat and 
interviewed them, in the main 
showing a better humor than he 
had shown his luckless guard. 
For Dixit, this scene had a cu- 
rious interest; he had watched 
Patel’s morning audience more 
than once, standing by Craw- 
146 


ley’s side in the UHDRE moni- 
toring station; now he was a 
prisoner waiting uncomfortably 
in the corner of the room, and 
the Whole atmosphere was chang- 
ed. He felt the extraordinary in- 
tensity of these people’s lives, 
the emotions compressed, every- 
thing vivid. Patel himself wept 
several times as some tale of 
hardship was unfolded to him. 
There was no privacy. Everyone 
stood round him, listening to 
everything. Short the lives might 
be; but those annihilating spaces 
that stretch through ordinary 
lives, the spaces through which 
one glimpses uncomfortable 
glooms and larger poverties, if 
not presences more sour and sin- 
ister, seemed here to have been 
eradicated. The Total Environ- 
ment had brought its peoples 
total involvement. Whatever be- 
fell them, they were united, as 
were bees in a hive. 

Finally, a break was called. 
The unfortunates who had not 
gained Patel’s ear were turned 
away; Malti was summoned and 
administered the damp-towel 
treatment to Patel. Later, he sent 
her off and ate a frugal meal. 
Only when he had finished it 
and sat momentarily in medita- 
tion, did he turn his brooding at- 
tention to Dixit. 

He indicated that Dixit was to 
fetch down the object Raital had 
placed on a shelf. Dixit did so 

GALAXY 


and put the object before Patel. 
Staring at it with interest, he saw 
it was an elaborate little Model, 
similar to the ones for sale on 
the balcony. 

“Observe it well,” Patel said. 
“It is the life-object of a man. 
You have these — ” he gestured 
vaguely — “outside?” 

“No.” 

“You know what they are?” 

“No.” 

“In this world of ours, Mr. 
Dixit, we have many holy men. 
I have a holy man here under 
my protection. On the deck be- 
low is one very famous holy 
man, Vazifdariji. These* men 
have many powers. Tonight, I 
shall give my holy man this life- 
object, and with it he will be 
able to enter the being of the 
man to whom it belongs, for 
good or ill, and in this case for 
ill, to revenge a death with a 
death.” 

D ixit stared at the little ob- 
ject, a three-dimensional 
maze constructed of silver and 
plastic strands, trying to com- 
prehend what Patel was saying. 

“This is a sort of key to its 
owner’s mind?” 

“No, no, not a key, and not to 
his mind. It is a — well, we do 
not have a scientific word for it, 
and our word would mean noth- 
ing to you, so I cannot say what. 
It is, let us say, a replica, a 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


substitute for the man’s being* 
Not his mind, his being. In this 
case, a man called Gita. You are 
very interested, aren’t you?” 

“Everyone here has one of 
these?” 

“Down to the very poorest 
and even the older children. A 
sage works in conjunction with a 
smith to produce each individual 
life-object.” 

“But they can be stolen and 
then an ill-intentioned holy man 
can use them to kill the owner. 
So why make them? I don’t un- 
derstand.” 

Smiling, Patel made a small 
movement of impatience. “What 
you discover of yourself, you 
record. That is how these things 
are made. They are not trinkets; 
they are a man’s record of his 
discovery of himself.” 

Dixit shook his head. “If they 
are so personal, why are so many 
sold by street traders as trink- 
ets?” 

“Men die. Then their life-ob- 
jects have no value, except as 
trinkets. They are also popularly 
believed to bestow . well, per- 
sonality-value. There also exist 
large numbers of forgeries, which 
people buy because they like 
to have them, simply as decora- 
tions.” 

After a moment, Dixit said. 
“So they are innocent things, but 
you take them and use them for 
evil ends.” 

147 


IX 


“I use them to keep a power 
balance. A man of mine called 
Narayan was silenced by Gita of 
Ninth Deck. Never mind why. 
So tonight I silence Gita to keep 
the balance.” 

He stopped and looked closely 
at Dixit, so that the latter re- 
ceived a blast of that enigmatic 
personality. He opened his hand 
and said, still observing Dixit, 
“Death sits in my palm, Mr. 
Dixit. Tonight I shall have you 
silenced also, by what you may 
consider more ordinary meth- 
ods.” 

Clenching his hands tightly to- 
gether, Dixit said, “You tell me 
about the life-objects, and yet 
you claim you are going to kill 
me. 

Patel pointed up to one cor- 
ner of his room. “There are eyes 
and ears there, while your ever- 
hungry spying friends suck up 
the facts of this world. You see, 
I can tell them — I can tell them 
so much and they can never 
comprehend our life. All the im- 
portant things can never be said, 
so they can never learn. But 
they can see you die tonight, and 
that they will comprehend. Per- 
haps then they will cease to 
send spies in here.” 

He clipped his hands once for 
the guard. They came forward 
and led Dixit away. As he went 
back to his cell, he heard Patel 
shouting for Malti. 

148 


T he hours passed in steady 
gloom. The U.N., the 
UHDRE, would not rescue him; 
the Environment charter per- 
mitted intervention by only one 
outsider at a time. Dixit could 
hear, feel, the vast throbbing life 
of the place going on about him 
and was shaken by it. 

He tried to think about the 
life-objects. Presumably Craw- 
ley had overheard the last con- 
versation, and would know that 
the holy men, as Patel called 
them, had the power to kill at a 
distance. There was the ESP evi- 
dence Crawley sought: telecide, 
or whatever you called it. And 
the knowledge helped nobody, as 
Patel himself observed. It had 
long been known that African 
witch doctors possessed similar 
talents, to lay a spell on a man 
and kill him at a distance; but 
how they did it had never been 
established; nor, indeed, had the 
fact ever been properly assimi- 
lated by the west, eager though 
the west was for new methods 
of killing. There were things one 
civilization could not learn from 
another; the whole business of 
life-objects, Dixit perceived, was 
going to be such a matter: end- 
lessly fascinating, entirely in- 
soluble .... 

He thought, returning to his 
cell, and told himself: Patel still 

GALAXY 


puzzles me. But it is no use 
hanging about here being 
puzzled. Here I sit, waiting for a 
knife in the guts. It must be 
night now. I’ve got to get out 
of here. 

There was no way out of the 
room. He paced restlessly up and 
down. They brought him no 
meal, which was ominous. 

A long while later, the door 
was unlocked and opened. 

It was Malti. She lifted one 
finger as a caution to silence, and 
closed the door behind her. 

“It’s time for me . .?” Dixit 
asked. 

She came quickly over to him, 
not touching him, staring at him. 
Though she was an ugly and 
despondent woman, beauty lay 
in her time-haunted eyes. 

“I can help you escape, Dixit. 
Patel sleeps now, and I have an 
understanding with the guards 
here. Understandings have been 
reached to smuggle you down to 
my own deck, where perhaps you 
can get back to the outside where 
you belong. This place is full of 
arrangements. But you must be 
quick. Are you ready?” 

“He’ll kill you when he finds 
out!” 

She shrugged. “He may not. I 
think perhaps he likes me. Prah- 
lad Patel is not inhuman, what- 
ever you think of him.” 

“No? But he plans to murder 
someone else tonight. He has ac- 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


quired some poor fellow’s life- 
object and plans to have his holy 
man kill him with night-visions, 
whatever they are.” 

She said, “People have to die. 
You are going to be lucky. You 
will not die, not this night.” 

“If you take that fatalistic 
view, why help me?” 

He saw a flash of defiance in 
her eyes. “Because you must 
take a message outside for me.” 
“Outside? To whom?” 

“To everyone there, everyone 
who greedily spies on us here 
and would spoil this world. Tell 
them to go away and leave us 
and let us make our own world. 
Forget us! That is my message! 
Take it! Deliver it with all the 
strength you have! This is our 
world — not yours!” 

T T er vehemence, her ignorance, 
silenced him. She led him 
from the room. There were 
guards on the outer door. They 
stood rigid with their eyes 
closed, seeing no evil, and she 
slid between them, leading Dixit, 
and opening the door. They hur- 
ried outside, on to the balcony, 
which was still as crowded as 
ever, people sprawling every- 
where in the disconsolate gestures 
of public sleep. With the noise 
and chaos and animation of day- 
time fled, Total Environment 
stood fully revealed for the echo- 
ing prison it was. 

149 


As Malti turned to go, Dixit 
grasped her wrist. 

“I must return,” she said. “Get 
quickly to the steps down to 
Ninth Deck, the near steps. 
That’s three flights to go down, 
the inter-deck flight guarded. 
They will let you through; they 
expect you.” 

“Malti, I must try to help 
this other man who is to die. Do 
you happen to know someone 
called Gita?” 

She gasped and clung to him. 
“Gita?” 

“Gita of the Ninth Deck. 
Patel has Gita’s life-object, and 
he is to die tonight.” 

“Gita is my step-father, my 
mother’s third husband. A good 
man! Oh, he must not die, for my 
mother’s sake!” 

“He’s to die tonight. Malti, I 
can help you and Gita. I ap- 
preciate how you feel about out- 
side, but you are mistaken. You 
would be free in a way you can- 
not understand! Take me to Gita, 
and we’ll all three get out to- 
gether.” 

Conflicting emotions chased 
all over her face. “You are sure 
Gita is to die?” 

“Come and check with him to 
see if his life-object has gone!” 

Without waiting for her to 
make a decision — in fact she 
looked as if she were just about 
to bolt back into Patel’s quarters 
— Dixit took hold of her and 
150 


forced her along the balcony, 
picking his way through the piles 
of sleepers. 

Ramps ran down from balcony 
to balcony in long zigzags. For 
all its multitudes of people — 
even the ramps had been taken 
up as dosses by whole swarms of 
urchins — Total Environment 
seemed much larger than it had 
when one looked in from the 
monitoring room. He kept peer- 
ing back to see if they were being 
followed; it seemed to him un- 
likely that he would be able to 
get away. 

But they had now reached the 
stairs leading down to Deck 
Nine. Oh, well, he thought, cor- 
ruption he could believe in; it 
was the universal oriental system 
whereby the small man contrived 
to live under oppression. As soon 
as the guards saw him and Malti, 
they all stood and closed their 
eyes. Among them was the 
wretched Raital, who hurriedly 
clapped palms over eyes as they 
approached. 

“I must go back to Patel,” 
Malti gasped. 

“Why? You know he will kill 
you,” Dixit said. He kept tight 
hold of her thin wrist. “All these 
witnesses to the way you led me 
to safety — you can’t believe he 
will not discover what you are 
doing. Let’s get to Gita quickly.” 

He hustled her down the stairs. 
There were Deck Nine guards at 

GALAXY 


the bottom. They smiled and 
saluted Malti and let her by. As 
if resigned now to doing what 
Dixit wished, she led him for- 
ward, and they picked their way 
down a ramp to a lower floor. 
The squalor and confusion were 
greater here than they had been 
above, the slumbers more 
broken. This was a deck without 
a strong leader, and it showed. 

He must have seen just such a 
picture as this over the bugging, 
in the air-conditioned comfort 
of the UHDRE offices, and re- 
mained comparatively unmoved. 
You had to be among it to feel 
it. Then you caught also the 
aroma of Environment. It was 
pungent in the extreme. 

A s they moved slowly down 
among the huddled figures 
abased by fatigue, he saw that 
a corpse burned slowly on a wood 
pile. It was the corpse of a child. 
Smoke rose from it in a leisurely 
coil until it was sucked into a 
wall vent. A mother squatted by 
the body, her face shielded by 
one skeletal hand. “It is the time 
when the old die,” Malti had 
said of the previous night; and 
the young had to answer that 
same call. 

This was the Indian way of 
facing the inhumanity of En- 
vironment: with their age-old ac- 
ceptance of suffering. Had one 
of the white races been shut in 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


here to breed to intolerable num- 
bers, they would have met the 
situation with a general mas- 
sacre. Dixit, a half-caste, would 
not permit himself to judge 
which response he most respect- 
ed. 

Malti kept her gaze fixed on 
the worn concrete underfoot as 
they moved down the ramp past 
the corpse. At the bottom, she 
led him forward again without a 
word. 

They pushed through the 
sleazy ways, arriving at last at a 
battered doorway. With a glance 
at Dixit, Malti slipped in and 
rejoined her family. Her mother, 
not sleeping, crouched over a 
wash bowl, gave a cry and fell 
into Malti’s arms. Brothers and 
sisters and half-brothers and 
half-sisters and cousins and 
nephews woke up, squealing. 
Dixit was utterly brushed aside. 
He stood nervously, waiting, 
hoping, in the corridor. 

It was many minutes before 
Malti came out and led him into 
the crowded little cabin. She in- 
troduced him to Shamim, her 
mother, who curtsied and rapid- 
ly disappeared, and to her step- 
father, Gita. 

The little wiry man shooed 
everyone out of one corner of 
the room and moved Dixit into 
it. A cup of wine was produced 
and offered politely to the visi- 
tor. As he sipped it, he said, “If 

151 


your step-daughter has explain- 
ed the situation, Gita, I’d like to 
get you and Malti out of here, 
because otherwise your lives are 
worth very little. I can guaran- 
tee you will be extremely kindly 
treated outside.” 

With dignity, Gita said, “Sir, 
all this very unpleasant business 
has been explained to me by my 
step-daughter. You are most 
good to take this trouble, but we 
cannot help you.” 

“You, or rather Malti, have 
helped me. Now it is my turn to 
help you. I want to take you 
out of here to a safe place. You 
realize you are both under the 
threat of death? You hardly need 
telling that Prahlad Patel is a 
ruthless man.” 

“He is very very ruthless, sir,” 
Gita said unhappily. “But we 
cannot leave here. I cannot leave 
here — look at all these little 
people who are dependent on me! 
Who would look after them if I 
left?” 

“But if your hours are num- 
bered?” 

“If I have only one minute to 
go before I die, still I cannot 
desert those who depend on me.” 

Dixit turned to Malti. “You, 
Malti — you have less responsi- 
bility. Patel will have his re- 
venge on you. Come with me and 
be safe!” 

She shook her head. “If I 
came, I would sicken with worry 
152 


for what was happening here and 
so I would die that way.” 

T T e looked about him hopeless- 
^ -*■ ly. The blind interdepen- 
dence bred by this crowded en- 
vironment had beaten him — al- 
most. He still had one card to 
play. 

“When I go out of here, as go 
I must, I have to report to my 
superiors. They are the people 
who — the people who really 
order everything that happens 
here. They supply your light, 
your food, your air. They are like 
gods to you, with the power of 
death over every one on every 
deck — which perhaps is why 
you can hardly believe in them. 
They already feel that Total En- 
vironment is wrong, a crime 
against your humanity. I have 
to take my verdict to them. My 
verdict, I can tell you now, is 
that the lives of all you people 
are as precious as lives outside 
these walls. The experiment must 
be stopped; you all must go free. 

“You may not understand en- 
tirely what I mean, but perhaps 
the wall screens have helped you 
grasp something. You will all be 
looked after and rehabilitated. 
Everyone will be released from 
the decks very soon. So, you can 
both come with me and save 
your lives; and then, in perhaps 
only a week, you will be re- 
united with your family. Patel 

GALAXY 



will have no power then. Now, 
think over your decision again, 
for the good of your dependents, 
and come with me to life and 
freedom.” 

Malti and Gita looked anxious- 
ly at each other and went into 
a huddle. Shamim joined in, and 
Jamsu, and lame Shirim, and 
more and more of the tribe, and 
a great jangle of excited talk 
swelled up. Dixit fretted ner- 
vously. 

Finally, silence fell. Gita said, 
“Sir, your intentions are plainly 
kind. But you have forgotten 
that Malti charged you to take 
a message to outside. Her mes- 
sage was to tell the people there 
to go away and let us make our 
own world. Perhaps you do not 
understand such a message and 
so cannot deliver it. Then I will 
give you my message, and you 
can take it to your superiors.” 

Dixit bowed his head. 

“Tell them, your superiors 
and everyone outside who insists 
on watching us and meddling in 
our affairs, tell them that we 
are shaping our own lives. We 
know what is to come, and the 
many problems of having such 
a plenty of young people. But we 
have faith in our next generation. 
We believe they will have many 
new talents we do not possess, as 
we have talents our fathers did 
not possess. 

“We know you will continue 

154 


to send in food and air, because 
that is something you cannot es- 
cape from. We also know that 
in your hidden minds you wish 
to see us all fail and die. You 
wish to see us break, to see what 
will happen when we do. You 
do not have love for us. You have 
fear and puzzlement and hate. 
We shall not break. We are 
building a new sort of world, we 
are getting clever. We would die 
if you took us out of here. Go 
and tell that to your superiors 
and to everyone who spies on us. 
Please leave us to our own lives, 
over which we have our own 
commands.” 

There seemed nothing Dixit 
could say in answer. He looked 
at Malti, but could see she was 
unyielding, frail and pale and 
unyielding. This was what 
UHDRE had bred: complete 

lack of understanding. He turned 
and went. 

He had his key. He knew the 
secret place on each deck where 
he could slip away into one of 
the escape elevators. As he push- 
ed through the grimy crowds, he 
could hardly see his way for 
tears. 

X 

Tt was all very informal. Dixit 

made his report to a board 
of six members of the UHDRE 
administration, including the 

GALAXY 


Special Project Organizer, Peter 
Crawley. Two observers were al- 
lowed to sit in, a grand lady who 
represented the Indian Govern- 
ment, and Dixit’s old friend, Sen- 
ator Jacob Byrnes, representing 
the United Nations. 

Dixit delivered his report on 
what he had found and added a 
recommendation that a rehabili- 
tation village be set up immedi- 
ately and the Environment 
wound down. 

Crawley rose to his feet and 
stood rigid as he said, “By your 
own words, you admit that these 
people of Environment cling 
desperately to what little they 
have. However terrible, however 
miserable, that little may seem 
to you. They are acclimatized 
to what they have. They have 
turned their backs to the outside 
world and don’t want to come 
out.” 

Dixit said, “We shall rehabili- 
tate them, re-educate them, find 
them local homes where the in- 
tricate family patterns to which 
they are used can still be main- 
tained, where they can be help- 
ed back to normality.” 

“But by what you say, they 
would receive a paralyzing shock 
if confronted with the outside 
world and its gigantic scale.” 

“Not if Patel still led them.” 

A mutter ran along the board; 
its members clearly thought this 
an absurd statement. Crawley 
TOTAL ENVIRONMENT 


gestured despairingly, as if hiss 
case were made, and sat down 
saying, “He’s the sort of tyrant 
who causes the misery in Envir- 
onment.”” 

“The one thing they need when 
they emerge to freedom is a 
strong leader they know. Gentle- 
men, Patel is our good hope. His 
great asset is that he is oriented 
towards outside already.” 

“Just what does that mean?” 
one of the board asked. 

“It means this. Patel is a 
clever man. My belief is that he 
arranged that Malti Should help 
me escape from his cell. He 
never had any intention of kill- 
ing me; that was a bluff to get 
me on my way. Little, oppressed 
Malti was just not the woman 
to take any initiative. What 
Patel probably did not bargain 
for was that I should mention 
Gita by name to her, or that 
Gita should be closely related to 
her. But because of their fata- 
lism, his plan was in no way up- 
set.” 

“Why should Patel want you 
to escape?” 

“Implicit in much that he did 
and said, though he tried to hide 
it, was a burning curiosity about 
outside. He exhibited facets of 
his culture to me to ascertain my 
reactions — testing for approval 
or disapproval, I’d guess, like a 
child. Nor does he attempt to 
attack other decks — the time- 

155 


honored sport of Environment 
tyrants; his attention is directed 
inwardly on us. 

“Patel is intelligent enough to 
know that we have real power. 
He has never lost the true pic- 
ture of reality, unlike his mi- 
nions. So he wants to get out. 

“He calculated that if I got 
back to you, seemingly having 
escaped death, I would report 
strongly enough to persuade you 
to start demolishing Total En- 
vironment immediately.” 

“Which you are doing,” Craw- 
ley said. 

“Which I am doing. Not for 
Patel’s reasons, but for human 
reasons. And for utilitarian rea- 
sons also — which will perhaps 
appeal more to Mr. Crawley. 
Gentlemen, you were right. 
There are mental disciplines in 
Environment the world could use, 
of which perhaps the least attrac- 
tive is telecide. UHDRE has 
cost the public millions on mil- 
lions of dollars. We have to re- 
coup by these new advances. We 
can only use these new advances 
by studying them in an atmo- 
sphere not laden with hatred and 
envy of us — in other words, 
by opening that black tower. 

Hphe meeting broke up. Of 
course, he could not expect 
anything more decisive than that 
for a day or two. 

Senator Byrnes came over. 

156 


“Not only did you make out a 
good case, Thomas; history is 
with you. The world’s emerging 
from a bad period and that dark 
tower, as you call it, is a sym- 
bol of the bad times, and so it 
has to go.” 

Inwardly, Dixit had his quali- 
fications to that remark. But they 
walked together to the window 
of the boardroom and looked 
across at the great rough bulk 
of the Environment building. 

“It’s more than a symbol. It’s 
as full of suffering and hope as 
our own world. But it’s a man- 
made monster — it must go.” 

Byrnes nodded. “Don’t worry. 
It’ll go. I feel sure that the his- 
torical process, that blind evolu- 
tionary thing, has already de- 
cided that UHDRE’s day is 
done. Stick around. In a few 
weeks, you’ll be able to help 
Malta’s family rehabilitate. And 
now I’m off to put in my two 
cents’ worth with the chairman 
of that board.” 

He clapped Dixit on the back 
and walked off. Inside he knew 
lights would be burning and 
those thronging feet padding 
across the only world they knew. 
Inside there, babies would be 
born this night and men die of 
old age and night-visions .... 

Outside, monsoon rain began 
to fall on the wide Indian land.

fans, it’s time for the 
Third Annual Galaxy 
Awards for impressing Algis 
Budrys with fiction in book form 
during the past year. This an- 
nual effrontery offers the lucky 
recipient nothing but the sight 
of his name in print an addition- 
al time, and an empty promise of 
drink. Arrangements are being 


157 


contemplated to add a grand 
prize of a month in Philadelphia; 
consult this space in the Feb- 
ruary, 1969, Galaxy for further 
developments on that score. 

The best novel of the past 
year was Samuel R. Delany’s 
The Einstein Intersection. Why 
did this bad book win? Because 
it is chockful of excellent inven- 
tions, of outrageous inventions 
such as a musical machete, of 
self-confidence and joy; because 
it conveys a sense that the author 
groped around until he found 
Kid Death to put in it. He does 
not do much with him, having 
him, but these are days in which 
a damned good grope is often the 
best you can do, and better than 
what romances they used to sell. 
So go buy this Ace book. 

The best publishing idea of the 
year was either Putnam’s The 
Past Through Tomorrow, collect- 
ing the major portion of Robert 
A. Heinlein’s Future History se- 
ries ($5.95), or Doubleday’s 
Three Stories (by Murray Lein- 
ster, Jack Williamson and John 
Wyndham), edited by Sam 
Moskowitz and priced at $3.95. 
We solve the dilemma by giving 
Putnam the cup for Publishing 
Idea and Sam the accolade for 
Editor. 

(Ah, by the way, when a pub- 
lishing company wins the Budrys 
Benison, one officially designated 
representative may approach the 

158 


Benefactor for one drink. He 
must carry a letter of introduc- 
tion from Mr. Putnam.) 

The Best Thing All Year was 
by Fritz Leiber. It was The Big 
Time, which I say is a play and 
Galaxy (and the 17th World SF 
Convention) said was a prize- 
winning novel. Would somebody 
care to produce it, so I can be 
proven stupid? 

I envy you all. 

It was time, I thought, to re- 
turn to those days of yesteryear 
when I could barely wait for the 
next issue of The Avon Fantasy 
Reader and the next Conan story 
reprint. Much had intervened, in- 
cluding the emergence of a posi- 
tive antipathy to the Ass of 
Aquilonia. So when Lancer Books 
sent me a copy of King Kull, by 
Robert E. Howard and Lin Car- 
ter edited by Glenn Lord with a 
teeming Roy Krenkel cover, I 
fell to. 

Kull, as you have to know, was 
a prototype Conan, a trial crea- 
tion by Robert Howard, picked 
up and dropped, dropped and 
picked up, while the modern 
master of mythic mishmash was 
tuning up for apotheosis. Some 
of the bobbles and incompletions 
have been worked over by Lin 
Carter, and rather well; I ran 
right through Black Abyss with- 
out realizing it was a posthumous 
collaboration, and only in hind- 

GALAXY 


sight did it occur to me the kind 
of pathos in it was not in accord 
with Howard as he was. 

This is, to sober up momentar- 
ily, a collection of stories about 
Kull, whom we meet briefly as a 
mysterious stranger in Atlantis 
before he turns up as king of 
equally foreign Valusia after one 
paragraph of summary. That 
paragraph would have contained 
a hundred thousand words about 
Conan. There are other hiati as 
well; you cannot get to know Kull 
as well as you know and can 
trace Conan’s development, sim- 
ply because if you could, Howard 
would not have had to go through 
a similar process with his better- 
known protagonist. If it weren’t 
for Carter’s skill at pastiche, you 
would know Kull even less than 
you do. 

If you like cut-and-thrust pre- 
diluvian adventure stories, com- 
bining a masochistic megaloma- 
nia with a strong streak of hor- 
ror writing, you will find here a 
pretty good dose thereof. If you 
would like to know more about 
Kull, then you are just going to 
have to join with my own feeling 
of faint exasperation at being 
pretty much forever barred from 
sharing in some of the most in- 
teresting portions of Kull’s life. 
A feeling of exasperation which, 
I might add, does not extend to 
Lancer Books; it was a good idea 
to do this book, however sketchy. 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


Nebula Award Stories T wo 
(Doubleday, $4.95), edited by 
Brian W. Aldiss and Harry Harri- 
son, is the very opposite end 
of the stick. Self-conscious, 
saddled with primerous blurbs 
and introductory matter, it is so 
sophisticated, so scrupulous in 
crediting even the supplier who 
manufactures the Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America’s Nebula 
Award tokens, that it resembles 
some kind of grotesque attempt 
to literatize a corporate state- 
ment. Fortunately, it is filled with 
good stories, or it would have 
been the most unctuous eulogy 
in years. 

These stories are winners and 
runners-up for the 1966 Nebula 
Awards. The volume understand- 
ably omits Delany’s Babel-17 
and Daniel Keyes’s Flowers For 
Algernon, the books which tied 
for the Best Novel award. It 
does include Jack Vance’s excel- 
lent novella, The Last Castle, 
and Gordon Dickson’s good Call 
Him Lord, the novelette category 
winner. 

The best short story of the 
year award went, posthumously, 
to Richard McKenna, for The 
Secret Place, which is included 
here, as are some very good run- 
ners-up such as Frederik Pohl’s 
Day Million, Bob Shaw’s Light 
of Other Days and Sonya Dor- 
man’s When 1 Was Miss Dow, 
any one of which is technically 

159 


and conceptually a better and 
more original story, more eco- 
nomically told. There is usually 
a reason why the unpublished 
stories found in dead men’s desks 
were unpublished, and that rea- 
son is very rarely one which justi- 
fies this kind of over-reaction. 
Especially by professionals. 

Good stories in this book are 
Among* the Hairy Earthmen by 
R.A. Lafferty, We Can Remem- 
ber It tor You Wholesale by 
Philip K. Dick, In the Imagicon 
by George H. Smith, and Man 
in His Time by Brian Aldiss. A 
strikingly plonky story is Robin 
Scott’s Who Needs Insurance?, 
which, although a Campbell pipe- 
line story like Call Him Lord, 
has not the virtue of clear 
thought. 

This is not a bad crop, and 
certainly worth having, if one has, 
five bucks to spend on a book 
of this unextraordinary length. 
But I can see little more logic 
and reasoned judgment reflected 
in this selection (and the desig- 
nation of Babel- 17 as equal to 
Flowers lot Algernon ) than there 
is in, for instance, the Hugo 
popularity poll. For years, we 
writers sat around vowing that 
When we had our award, by God, 
it would be impeccable. It ain’t. 

It is not the province of this 
column to review science books 
— though I do wish someone 

160 


would. Nevertheless, Doubleday 
hag sent me Is Anyone There?, 
a collection of essays by Isaac 
Asimov, originally published in 
a great .variety of places, at $5.95. 
And while I cannot review the 
factual content, perhaps we can 
reason together for a moment. 
Viz.: 

The essays cover ground in a 
variety of sciences. Isaac cannot 
possibly know all of them as 
well as he knows biochemistry. 
Therefore, this is primarily an 
exercise in science writing — in 
studying up enough on a given 
discipline to be able to give a 
coherent account of it to laymen. 
The range of this book is such 
that it is a potential leg up for 
almost anyone who wants to get 
an idea of “science says” about 
almost any of the larger cate- 
gories of life. Does it do this well? 

Compiled from a diversity of 
original publications for a variety 
of sometimes markedly disparate 
audiences, it has a tendency to 
trip from elementary textbook 
style: “We all know that food 
intake is regulated by the ap- 
petite. You eat when you are 
hungry and stop eating when you 
are full,” to something rather dif- 
ferent: “The unstable interme- 
diate compound requires the in- 
put of a comparatively large 
amount of energy, but un- 
til it is formed, no final products 
will be formed, although the pro- 

GALAXY 


ducts themselves are not partic- 
ularly high-energy. The entire 
reaction will proceed no more 
quickly than the unstable inter- 
mediate can be formed.” The 
potential reader will find him- 
self bouncing between the simpli- 
fied and the underextended. How 
annoying or how mystifying this 
will be to him depends on his 
present understanding of these 
various subjects. But it doesn’t 
seem likely any one reader will 
get uniform information and en- 
joyment out of the book. 

While we’re at this, let me 
recommend This New Ocean 
(Superintendent of Documents, 
Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402, $5.50 in 
cloth), which is NASA’s story of 
Project Mercury. Written on a 
NASA grant by three historians, 
it may be full of lies and sloppy 
research, but I don’t think so; in 
any event, it’s a long, narrative 
account of the original U.S. as- 
tronaut project, full of human 
sidelights, some rather interesting 
facts which I don’t think trickled 
into your daily paper at the time, 
and a fine ability to convey what 
flying a Mercury capsule might 
have felt like to you. 

There is also what seems to 
me to be a terrific set of appen- 
dices and indexing, as well as a 
great many excellent photo- 
graphs and diagrams. A straight 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


publisher could easily bring out 
a successful popular paperback 
version. Meanwhile, I believe 
there is also a less expensive ver- 
sion of this book in cardboard 
covers from the G.P.O.; I suggest 
you write to tire Superintendent 
of Documents and inquire, if 
you’re not interested in a perma- 
nent copy. 

Finally, this issue’s crop of 
books includes The Amsirs and 
the Iron Thorn, by Algis 
Budrys, from Gold Medal Books, 
which calls me a classic master of 
science fiction. In which case, 
where did they get the chutzpah 
to mess with my title? 

The Iron Thorn ran as a four- 
part serial in If, not vanishingly 
long ago. The present version is 
somewhat longer, and with new 
material including a nursery 
rhyme, and a fair amount of new 
work done on the ending. The ad- 
ditions and revisions go in the 
direction of refining what was al- 
ready there, so the chances are 
that if you didn’t understand the 
ending of the serial, you won’t 
understand the ending of the 
book. I will take the blame; I 
should remove the marbles from 
my mouth. 

The story is of a young man 
raised by apes on Mars. He 
hunts, he rebels, he slays foe and 
friend, and periodically, he 
creates. He gets into deathly 

161 


trouble, and gets out of it. He 
does not always get out of it by 
being very strong or very smart, 
though he is strong and on some 
subjects is no dope, and about 
at the point where a self-willed 
spaceship carries him off to 
Earth, any attraction he may 
have had as a physical hero be- 
gins to get drained out of him. 

He bumps into some clearly un- 
usual characters, including Ah- 
muls the halfbaked gingerbread 
man. Ahmuls at times seems to 
be taking over the physical role, 
but he gets sidetracked toward 
the end of the story, in a scene 
stolen from the last line of a poem 
by Stephen Vincent Benet. 

My hero — who also has a 
confusing set of names — seems 
to be an artist at some times, but 


shows flashes of being an actor, 
a hummer, and, toward the end, 
a writer or at least a narrator of 
some kind . perhaps he is a 
standup comic. 

Now, we all know people like 
that. Based on my long-standing 
interest in processes ... in the 
step-by-step and perhaps boring 
developments that transform a 
likely or unlikely lad into a 
werewolf, for instance ... I 
messed around with this idea for 
a very long time, finally got it 
out at the last possible moment, 
and may not have had anything 
there for you in the first place, 
after all. 

But I thought I knew what I 
was doing, and I enjoyed myself.

Sow Hiey Save It Back 



by R. A. LAFFERTY 
It was the most fun they had 
ever had , in Fun City , U.S.A.I 



T T e was the Mayor of Big 
Island. Giuseppe Juan Sch- 
lome O’Hanlon was his name, 
John the Mayor, a shining black 
man. He was born into a politi- 
cal family and was given the 
names to please as many groups 
as possible. He had once been of 
imposing appearance and quiet 
dignity. He was not now. He 
shrilled and keened and moaned, 
and sometimes he was irrational. 

It was his leg that hurt him, 
and his soul. 

His leg hurt him because of 
the pin clear through it, the pin 
that was part of the shackle. 
This shackle could not be unlock- 
ed mechanically. It was a psy- 
chic-coded lock on the shackle, 
and it could only be released 
when John had somehow fulfill- 
ed his job and obtained his own 
release. The shackle bound his 
leg not only to his desk but also 


to a steel stanchion that was 
part of the steel frame of the 
building. 

John’s soul hurt him because 
Big Island was no longer the 
great thing to which he had been 
devoted. It had never been so in 
his lifetime. It was neo-jungle 
now, probably the most savage 
of them all. Even now there were 
fires burning on the floor above 
him and on the floor below him. 
There were always fires burning 
somewhere in the building, in 
every building that still had any- 
thing that would burn. There 
were rats in the room, in every 
room, but perhaps John saw more 
of them than were there. He lived 
in perpetual delirium. 

There were (he knew, though 
he could no longer go out and 
see) people unburied in the 
streets, people knifed down hour- 
ly, people crazy and empty- 


163 


eyed or glitter-eyed. There was 
horrible horn music and git-fiddle 
music and jangle shouting; and 
he was a prisoner for life in his 
own office. This was not how to 
be a great administrator of a 
great city. The emphasis had 
somehow shifted. But he had 
loved the City and the Island, 
or the memory of them. And 
this hurt his soul. 

“You have to stay on the job 
and run the place for the rest of 
your life,” Commissioner Kreger 
had told John the Mayor just 
before the commissioner had cut 
and run for it, “There will, of 
course, be no more elections. The 
burlesque that brought you in 
was enough to end the process. 
It was fiasco.” 

“It was not,” John the Mayor 
moaned in pain. “It was high 
triumph, the man of the people 
called to head the people, a no- 
ble thing, the climax and sole 
goal of my life. I won it finally. 
They can’t take that away from 
me.” 

“How does it taste, John?” 
“I’m dying, do not taunt me. 
What went wrong?” 

“It went wrong a hundred 
years before you were born, 
John. You lived all your life in a 
dream, and you had better try to 
re-enter it. You’re here for good. 
You’re the ultimate patsy, John.” 
“I’ll kill myself.” 

“No, you will not. You were 
164 


allowed to have this job because 
by temperament and religion, the 
residue of your dream, you were 
incapable of suicide. So many of 
our mayors have taken that easy 
way out! It was a nuisance, 
John.” 

“I’ll go crazy then,” John the 
Mayor moaned. 

“No, you likely will not do 
that either, though it would not 
matter if you did. You are al- 
ready psychotic, of course, but 
you will not go off much fur- 
ther. Stay and suffer, kid. You 
have no choice.” 

“Kreger, isn’t there some way 
we can get rid of this whole 
Island? Sell it, transfer title to 
it, give it back to someone? Can’t 
we get out from under?” 

“You find a way, John. Those 
things that we once thought of 
as abstractions have taken a di- 
rect hand now: Final Responsi- 
bility, Ultimate Justice, things 
like that. They must be satisfied. 
Whatever you do will have to 
satisfy the psychic-coded lock on 
your shackles to give you re- 
lease. Sell the Island legal, if you 
can find someone to sell it to. 
Transfer it, if you can find some- 
one to accept the transfer. But it 
must be for Fair Value or Value 
Justified or Original Value from 
Original Entailment. The psy- 
chic-code thing will know. It’s 
governed by the Equity Factor.” 

Then Commissioner Kreger left 
GALAXY 


John the Mayor, left the Island 
and went to rich fishing in other 
troubled (but not completely 
polluted) waters. There was no 
more profit for that smart man 
to shake out of the Island. 

nphat had been two years ago, 
and John the Mayor had 
been the only official on the 
Island since that time. His only 
contacts with the world were 
the sharp noises and smells that 
came in through his broken win- 
dows and the visits of five feudal 
or wrangle leaders, the Duke, the 
Sky, the Wideman, the Cloud 
and the Lolo. 

Duke Durango was as smooth 
a gutter-fighter as ever came to 
the top of his heap, a happy fel- 
low. Lawrence Sky was a fair 
white man named for the color 
of his big sky-blue eyes, a sham- 
bling giant, a giggling killer. 
Wideman Wyle was a wide man 
indeed, a cheerful sadist who told 
really funny stories and was the 
most pleasant person in the 
group. Cloud Clinkenbeard was 
a dour and stormy fellow, mean 
and relentless, and always in 
search of dirty novelty. Lolo 
Loudermilk was a girl, sort of a 
girl, a flaming mixed creature 
full of vitality and noise. 

They were the Mayor’s only 
contacts. They were the leaders 
of one of the gangs that had en- 
dured, when the ten thousand 
HOW THEY GAVE IT BACK 


gangs had eaten each other up 
and declined to a hundred. 

All five of them came into the 
Mayor’s office, eating noisily. 

“Food train in!” announced the 
Duke. “We killed just one of the 
drivers. They say there’ll never 
be another train in if we kill more 
than one driver at a time. And 
we had to give up four hostages 
for it. Isn’t four too many, 
John?” 

“Numbers have no meaning in 
this evil thing,” said John the 
Mayor. “How many hostages 
have you left?” 

“Twenty, and a few more, I 
think. We don’t all count the 
same when we get to the big 
numbers. But I think four is too 
many to give for a food train. 
What will happen when we run 
out of hostages? Who’ll give the 
big damn to subscribe a train 
for us then, when we have no 
more important people to trade 
to the important people off- 
island? Here, sign this, limp-leg 
John, and the Cloud will take it 
back to them.” 

The mayor read the release 
and signed it. Each of the five 
feudal leaders looked it over in 
turn then. Several of them could 
read a little (it was for this rea- 
son that they were the Mayor’s 
contacts), and it would be hard 
for Mayor John to write anything 
phoney on that release and slip 
it past them. The Mayor had to 

165 


sign these releases every time a 
food train came, and he knew 
what would happen when they 
ran out of hostages. The black- 
mail would be over when the 
last hostage of value or affection 
to someone off-Island had been 
turned over for a food train. The 
off-Island people would let the 
Island rot. The trains had been 
the only food source for the 
Island for years. 

The Cloud took the release and 
went out through the smoulder- 
ing corridor and into the broken 
streets to the food train that 
came once a month through the 
last not-completely-broken tun- 
nel. 

“Something else came on the 
food trail, gimpy John,” the 
Duke said uneasily. 

“Well, what, what was it? 
Duke, Duke, you didn’t get hold 
of a saw so I could saw my leg 
off, did you?” 

“Nah. You’re not supposed to 
saw your leg off. You’re supposed 
to stay here just like you are. 
Who’s going to sign for the food 
trains and hostage transfers if 
our mayor saws his leg off and 
runs away? 

“John Mayor, there’s three 
other men came on that food 
train. These are funny men. 
They might even be important 
enough men that we can hold 
them for hostages. They brought 
some heavy kegs and boxes with 
166 


them, John, and they even con- 
ned some of the colts into carry- 
ing them over here for them. 
We can’t figure out what kind of 
men they are, Mayor. They look 
at us, and we look at them, and 
we both got sparks in our eyes. 
They are in the building now, 
Mayor, and want to see you.” 
“Show them in, spook Duke, 
the mayor is always available to 
his constituents.” 

“Constituents these are not,” 
said the Lolo. “They are washed- 
out pale fellows, but they are 
solid.” 

“And one of those kegs of 
theirs got a smell I like, Mayor,” 
said the Sky. “I believe I re- 
member that smell like it was 
born in me. You get that keg, 
Mayor.” 

“And those long crates got a 
heft I like,” said the Wideman. 
“I almost know what will be in 
those crates. You get those 
crates, Mayor.” 

“Those square boxes got a feel 
I like,” said the Lolo. “I almost 
know what .short-handled things 
will be in those square boxes. 
And the smallest package has a 
brass glint through a rip in it. 
You get those square boxes and 
that smallest package, Mayor.” 
“I don’t understand this at all,” 
said John the Mayor, rolling his 
red-rimmed eyes in his constant 
pain. “Let the men and their 
baggage come in.” 


GALAXY 


>T'he three new men who came 
in had a certain animal 
power about them, and a certain 
human authority. Possibly they 
might be important enough to 
hold for hostages, but who was 
going to take the lead in holding 
diem? Men, they moved like big 
cats. But they were dressed like 
businessmen of an earlier decade, 
an anomaly on the Island, and 
they were lighter than any of the 
Islanders there except Lawrence 
Sky. 

“You are the Mayor John- 
John?” asked one of the new 
men. “And you have authority 
to deal?” 

“I am the mayor,” said John, 
“and I have such authority as a 
shackled prisoner may have. For 
what do we deal?” 

“Oh, for the Island. We’ve 
come to buy it. You’d like that, 
wouldn’t you?” 

“What, what, who are you?” 
“I am Adrian Sweetsong,” said 
the first of the new men. “I’m 
a petroleum geologist by profes- 
sion, which has nothing to do 
with the matter. And I’m an of- 
ficial of the Midlands Gun and 
Rod Club.” 

“I’m Dennis Halftown,” said 
the second of the new men. “I’m 
an electronic engineer by pro- 
fession, which has nothing to do 
with the matter either. And I’m 
also an official of the Midlands 
Gun and Rod Club.” 

HOW THEY GAVE IT BACK 


“I’m Freddy Flatfish,” said the 
third of the new men. “I’m a 
lawyer, which does have some- 
thing to do with this matter. I 
am also an official of the Mid- 
lands Gun and Rod Club, and I 
have studied the legal aspects of 
this thing pretty thoroughly.” 
“Is it the Midlands Gun and 
Rod Club that is dealing for the 
Island?” Mayor John asked. 

“That’s right,” said Ad'rian 
Sweetsong, the first of the new 
men. “First installment! Set ’em 
right there, boys.” 

Several of the colts, the strong 
rough Island boys, set down two 
heavy square boxes, and Dennis 
Halftown (the second of the new 
men) broke them open with a 
pry-bar. 

“Man-eating Millie! Those 
things are for me!” the Lolo 
gasped, and she had a couple of 
them out in her hands. 

“Sweet little choppies!” the 
Sky drooled. “What’s a knife 
alongside of one of those?” 
“Hackberry pudding!” cried 
the Cloud as he returned from 
his errand. “Here, here, they 
look good, let’s get them tested. 
I’ll just pass a dozen of those out 
the windows to some of the boys. 
Let them try them out! Let them 
fall in love with them!” 

“Fifty hatchets,” announced 
Adrian Sweetsong, “delivered and 
accepted. We record them.” 
“Wait! Wait!” howled Mayor 

167 


John, jangling his shackles. 
“What have fifty hatchets to do 
with dealing for the Island? Who 
has used hatchets for a century?” 
“One-leg John,” the Duke 
crooned, “too bad your shackles 
won’t let you get as far as the 
window. Some of the boys are 
using them now. Believe me, 
John, they’re using them now!” 
“Mr. Sweetsong,” Mayor John 
explained patiently, “the last 
valuation of Island property ever 
made set it at over a hundred 
billion dollars. Due to certain de- 
velopments it may be down a 
little now, but not that far. 
Hatchets will not get it. I can 
sell it only for fair value or value 
justified. My own shackling is 
governed by the Equity Factor.” 
“We know that, Mr. Mayor,” 
said Freddy Flatfish, the lawyer 
for the Midlands Gun and Rod 
Club. Freddy Flatfish was a 
tow-headed twinkling man. “But 
the Island has reverted. It’s real- 
ly worthless since it was left to 
the ten thousand gangs, which 
have since devoured themselves 
down to a hundred. Perhaps its 
reverted value is now its original 
value. Anyhow, the first ap- 
proach was yours.” 

“Mine? Mine? I made no ap- 
proach. I never heard of you 
fellows,” the Mayor said. 

“But we have monitored you, 
Mayor John. Two years you said 
to the Commissioner ‘Can’t we 
168 


give it back to someone?’ And 
you are also recorded as say- 
ing ‘We ought to sell it bade 
to — 

“Second installment!” an- 
nounced Adrian Sweetsong. “Set 
them right there, boys.” 

Qeveral of the colts set down 
^ the long crates, and Dennis 
Halftown broke them open with 
his pry-bar. 

“Oh, those long sweet songs!” 
the Wideman slavered. “Smooth 
bores! You can jam them with 
any kind of soup at all and pan- 
light them. You can shoot broken 
glass with them. You can shoot 
anything. Here, we’ll just hand 
a few of them out the windows 
and let the fellows try them out. 
Get the heft of those things! 
Even as clubs your hands would 
fall in love with them! Blunder- 
busses!” And the Wideman hand- 
ed half a dozen of them out the 
windows. 

“Twenty guns,” announced 
Adrian Sweetsong. “Delivered 
and accepted. We record them.” 

“Even if it were possible for 
me to deal the Island for things 
of no value,” John the Mayor be- 
gan — and there was deep- 
throated roaring and death- 
screaming in the streets. 

“No value, Mayor?” the Duke 
Durango asked with deep irony. 
“Mayor, you should be able to 
watch them. They jam them with 

GALAXY 


soup, and then ram in glass and 
nails for a load. They spark them 
off, and it’s wonderful. Cuts peo- 
ple right in two. Don’t talk no 
value about those things!” 

“Even if it were possible for 
me to deal the Island for such 
things, what could the Midlands 
Gun and Rod Club possibly do 
with the Island?” Mayor John 
asked. 

“Set up a hunting preserve,” 
Adrian Sweetsong said. “It’s a 
nicely stocked jungle island 
seventeen miles by four. We’ll 
hunt. We’ll hunt.” 

“Hunt? What would you 
hunt?” the mayor wanted to 
know. 

“Big game, big game,” said 
Dennis Halftown lovingly. 

“But there is no big game, no 
game at all on the Island,” the 
mayor insisted. 

“Remember what ancient Hem- 
ingway wrote,” said Freddy Flat- 
fish. “ ‘There is no sport equal 
to the hunting of an armed man.’ 
Ah, we’ll hunt them here, as will 
many of our well-heeled mem- 
bers.” 

“Third installment! Set it 
right there, boys,” Adrian Sweet- 
song ordered. 

The ragged Island boys set 
down the keg, and Dennis Half- 
town broke it open with his pry- 
bar. 

“Boys, boys, that’s the smell 
like was bom in me!” the Sky 

HOW THEY GAVE IT BACK 


chortled, and he had his arms 
up to the elbows in the dark 
grainy powder. “Sure it hasn’t 
the power of soup. Sure it’s 
clumsy and crude. But it’s tike 
grandpa of them all! The smell 
of it, the smell of it! Men, men, 
bust your noses on that smell!” 

“Twenty-five kilograms of 
gunpowder,” announced Adrian 
Sweetsong. “That’s as close as 
we could figure it. Twenty-five 
kilos delivered and accepted. 

( C T Tt Then you going to start, 
’ ' fellows, when you going 
to start?” the Duke asked the 
three new men in excitement, get- 
ting the idea. “How soon you 
be ready to start?” asked the 
Duke and the Sky and the Wide- 
man and the Cloud and the 
Lolo, all going for it avidly. 

“Should be the first bunch of 
hunters here in the morning,” 
said Adrian Sweetsong. 

“Too long to wait,” the Lolo 
protested. “You three? How 
about you?” 

“We three will begin stalking 
and pot-shotting in a very few 
minutes,” said the Adrian, “just 
as soon as we can get title to 
this place from the reluctant 
mayor. We suggest you deploy 
your forces outside in the corri- 
dors. When we come out of this 
room we will come out rough, 
and' it’s rough animals we want 
to meet with.” 


169 


“Rough it will be,” said the 
Cloud. “Colts, colts, you carry 
this stuff out to our place again 
just as soon as they have record- 
ed it. Men, we will have some 
sport! We will show these sports 
some sport!” 

“But this cannot be, even in a 
nightmare,” Major John pro- 
tested. “You three pale-browns 
are not Wappingers or Manhat- 
tas, and we are not Dutch.” 

“I’m a Choctaw,” said Fred- 
dy Flatfish. “Dennis Halftown 
is a Shawnee. Adrian Sweetsong 
is an Osage. But we inherit. I 
have drawn up a legal brief to 
prove it. And you are double- 
Dutch if you don’t accept. Awk, 
blew half my shoulder off! Those 
animals are jumping the gun. 
Now I know how the expression 
started. They really know how 
to handle those blunderbusses.” 

Freddy Flatfish had been shot 
by a blunderbuss blast from the 
corridor and was bleeding badly. 
So they hurried it along, anxious 
to close the bargain and get the 
hunting season started. 

“Bring them in fast, boys. Set 
them down till they are accepted 
and' recorded. Then take them 
out again to your place,” Adrian 
Sweetsong ordered. And the 
rough colts brought in a variety 
of boxes and packages. 

“Ten shirts, accepted and rec- 
orded,” Adrian Sweetsong an- 
nounced, hurriedly now. “Thirty 
170 


pair socks, accepted and record- 
ed. One hundred bullets, accepted 
and recorded. Forty kettles, ac- 
cepted and recorded. One brass 
frying-pan, accepted and record- 
ed.” 

And at the recording of the 
brass frying-pan, the leg-piercing 
pin was withdrawn from the leg 
of Mayor John and all his 
shackles fell off. The psychic- 
coded lock of his shackles had 
opened. He had finished his job 
and was released. He had dis- 
posed of the Island in equity. 
He had gotten Fair Value for 
it, or Value Justified, or at least 
Original Value from Original En- 
tailment. And it sufficed. 

Mayor John was free. He 
started to run from the room, 
fell down on his crippled leg 
and arose and ran once more. 
And was caught in a blunderbuss 
blast. 

And then the great hunt be- 
gan. The three members of the 
Midlands Gun and Rod Club 
had most sophisticated weapons. 
They were canny and smooth. 
This was the dangerous big-game 
hunt they had always dreamed 
of. And their prey were armed 
and wild and truculent and joy- 
ous. 

It would be good. 

/^vut between the orbs, several 
tentacles of Ultimate Jus- 
tice came near together. 


GALAXY 


“Was there not somewhere 
the mention of twenty-four or 
twenty-six dollars paid?” one 
tentacle asked the other. “I 
thought I rememberd some such 
figure.” 

“No, no,” said the other ten- 
tacle. “That was only the esti- 
mated value placed on the ma- 
terial. There was no specie paid. 
The list is correct as rendered, 
and the repayment has been ac- 
cepted and certified.” 

In a forgotten and half -filled 


basement on the Island, two of 
the remaining old-folk people 
were still in hiding. They were 
startled by the new sort of noise. 

“What is it, papa? What have 
they done?” the old woman ask- 
ed. 

“Sold it back to the Indians, 
mama,” the old man said. 

“Huh,” said the old woman. 
“Why didn’t they think of that 
a long time ago?”

FORECAST 

Next issue in Galaxy we'll be bringing back some old friends, 
always an occasion for pleasure. This time more pleasurable than ever, 
we think, considering that one of the old friends is Clifford D. Simak, and 
what he has for us is what we firmly believe to be the best story he's written 
since Here Gather the Stars. The name of it is Goblin Reservation. That's 
what it's about, too — a future world in which goblins and banshees are 
scientifically recognized entities, in which a ghost is one of the leading 
characters . and where aliens of a particularly disturbing variety are 
trying a spot of divide-and-rule among Earth's diverse human and spectral 
inhabitants. 

Then Damon Knight has a fine new novelette for us, The World 
and Thorinn. Knight spends so much of his time on editorial, critical and 
translation assignments — and until recently, ever more in his capacity as 
president of the Science Fiction Writers of Aemrica — that it's a real 
triumph to get a new story from him. Especially when it's the first of half 
a dozen or so. 

And the other old friend we know will be around is a fellow named 
Ross Rocklynne. New readers may never have heard of him; it's been that 
long since he's written a science-fiction story. (Fifteen years, anyway.) But 
old-timers who remember the likes of Into the Darkness, The Men and the 
Mirror and other Rocklynne classics of a couple decades ago will know 
that Touch of the Moon will be worth reading! See you then.

THE 

BIG SHOW 

by KEITH LAUMER 

Illustrated by WOO'D 


This is the day the networks stopped 
— and what could ten billion viewers 
now find to do with their little lives? 


I 

T ew Jan try awoke with soft fe- 
‘ 1 minine arms around him, a 
warm body snuggled against his, 
perfumed hair tickling his chin. 

He didn’t open his eyes at 
once; he was too old a trouper 
for that. Instead, he rapidly sort- 
ed through his recollections, ori- 
enting himself before making a 


move. He was in a bed; that was 
a starting point; and the quality 
of the light shining through his 
closed lids indicated it was full 
daylight — or its equivalent. 
That was no help; both the Jan- 
try and Osgood bedrooms featur- 
ed large east-exposure windows 
with fluffy curtains. He’d have to 
speak to Sol about that: a fel- 
low needed a little sharper de- 

172 


marcation of environmental de- 
tail to avoid role-fatigue. 

Lew opened one eye half a 
millimeter, made out the smooth 
curve of a shoulder, the sleek 
line of a bare back. Still no clue 
that would answer the burning 
question: was he in bed with his 
real wife, or his TV wife? 

The seconds were ticking past. 
Jantry thought furiously, trying 
to summon up the memory of 
those particular circumstances 
under which he had turned in. 
Had he slept an hour, a minute, 
or all night? Had he been at 
home, in the class A Banshire 
Towers Apartment of a medium- 
rated actor, with Marta, his law- 
ful-wedded spouse? Or had he 
dropped off on the set, in the 
cardboard and plastic mock-up 
where he spent twelve of every 
twenty-four hours, with Carla, 
his co-star on The Osgoods? 
Damn! He remembered cocktails, 
the Bateses dropping in, late 
talk; but that had been a scene 
in Rabinowitz’s latest script of 
the blab-blab school — or had it? 
Was he thinking of the Harrises, 
the bores in the next apartment 
at the Banshire? Uh-huh, that 
was it. A1 Harris had rattled on 
and on about his new two hun- 
dred channel set, with the twenty 
screen monitor attachment, where 
a sharp viewer with a good wrist 
could keep in touch with practi- 
cally every top show simul- 
THE BIG SHOW 


taneously, at least well enough 
to hold up his end of a cultured 
conversation .... 

Satisfied, Lew relaxed, slid his 
hand casually down toward the 
curved hip beside him. The 
woman moved, twisted her head 
back to impale him with a sharp 
black eye. 

“You're ten seconds off-cue, 
Buster!'’ Carla’s subvocalized 
voice rasped in the pick-up set 
in the bone back of his right ear. 
“ And let’s watch those hands! 
This is a family -type show, and 
my husband Bruno is a dedicated 
viewer!” 

T ew’s face snapped in a Smile, 
*— J lazy, marital, degree one, a 
stylized grimace that would in- 
stantly dispel all implications of 
lust from the minds of well-con- 
ditioned viewers. Meanwhile, he 
was stalling, groping for his line. 
Where the hell was the promp- 
ter? 

“Hi, darling,” the dubber’s 
voice sounded in the pick-up set 
in the bone back of Lew’s left 
ear, just as the audience would 
hear it. “ Today’s the day of the 
big event. Excited?” In the back- 
ground, he could hear the hun- 
dred piece orchestra sliding into 
Camptown Races. He grabbed at 
the clue. 

“Sure — but, uh, with you in 
the stands, rooting for him, who 
could lose?” he improvised, 

173 


mouthing the words distinctly for 
the vocal stand-in to mime later. 

“What who, you boob?” Car- 
la’s voice hissed in his right ear. 
‘“I’m having a baby at two 
o’clock!” 

“Oh, Freddy Osgood — some- 
times I think I’m the luckiest girl 
in the world, having you all to 
myself !” the canned line crackled 
in his left ear. 

“A baby?” Lew blurted, strug- 
gling to pick up the thread. 

“What do you think, you sch- 
lock — a litter of kitties?” Car- 
la snarled in his right ear. 

“I didn’t know you were — I 
mean, that you’d — that we’d 
— ” Lew caught himself. “Con- 
gratulations,” he ad libbed des- 
perately. 

“We’d better hurry and get 
ready; we’re going water-skiing 
with the Poppins before we’re 
due at the Vitabort Center,” his 
left ear cooed. 

“Sure,” Lew agreed, glad of 
the chance of escape. He threw 
back the blanket, caught just a 
glimpse of a saucy derriere before 
Carla squalled and yanked the 
sheets back up. 

“Cut!” A godlike bellow rat- 
tled Lew’s occipital sutures. The 
wall with the window slid aside 
to admit the charging bulk 
of Hugo Fleischpultzer himself. 
“Jantry, you just set the industry 
back fifty years!” the director 
howled. “Whattaya mean, insult- 
174 


ing five hundred million clean- 
living Americans with the sight 
of a bare behind first thing in the 
morning! It’ll take the psych- 
an channels two weeks of inten- 
sive primetime therapy to clear 
out the damage you done! You’re 
fired! Or you would be if it 
wasn’t for the lousy Guild! Not 
that I mean anything by the 
word ‘lousy’!” 

/^larla Montez sat up, holding 
the covers to her chin, point- 
ed a scarlet- nailed finger at Lew. 

“I want a divorce!” she 
screamed. “Tell Oscar to write 
this louse out of the script for 
screening no later than Friday 
in the late early mid-afternoon 
segment!” 

“Now, Carla baby, you know 
that’s impossible,” Abe Katz, the 
makeup man soothed, reaching 
past Fleischpultzer’s bulk to ad- 
just the star’s eyelashes. 

“I’m sorry, Hugo,” Lew said. 
“I just got a little mixed up for 
a second. You know how it’s been 
since we went to non-stop sit- 
com: a three-hour shift at home, 
three on the set, half my meals 
here, half there, barely time to 
scan the scripts — ” 

“See?” Carla shrilled. “He 
practically admits he prefers be- 
ing with that blowsy dame he’s 
supposedly married to!” 

“I do not — I mean Marta’s 
no blowsier than you are!” Lew 

GALAXY 


flared. “I mean, neither one of 
you is blowsy! And I love being 
cooped up with you in this make- 
believe egg-crate for half my 
life!” 

“The kids!” Carla sobbed. 
“What will become of the kids? 
Joey, and little Suzie, and that 
new one, Irving or whatever, that 
we hired last week for the cou- 
sin!” 

“Rusty, his air name is,” Hugo 
boomed. “Carla’s right, we got to 
think of the little ones. We 
don’t want to go making a broken 
home out of a fine American 
family, which it’s the favorite es- 
cape of millions, just over a little 
misunderstanding like this. Lew, 
I’ll give you one more chance — ” 

“Oh, no you won’t!” a furious 
contralto cut across the conver- 
sation. All eyes turned to the pert, 
green-eyed woman who had just 
burst onto the set. “I’ve watch- 
ed my husband crawl into bed 
with that harpie for the last 
time! I’m here to scratch her 
eyes out!” 

“Marta! No!” Lew, leaping 
from the bed, collided with Car- 
la, leaping in the opposite direc- 
tion. They struck the floor to- 
gether, a confused mass of flail- 
ing limbs, complicated by the ac- 
tress’ efforts to simultaneously 
escape, attack and observe the 
conventions of modesty. 

“Look at them — right in front 
of me!” Marta keened. 

THE BIG SHOW 


“Carla baby — watch the hair- 
do!” Abe Katz called. 

“Quiet on the set!” Hugo’s 
bass roar dominated the scene. 
Carla came to her feet, swathed 
in the sheet, as Lew struggled to 
arrange a blanket, Navaho style, 
about himself. 

“Now, Marta honey,” he said 
hastily. “Don’t leap to conclu- 
sions! It’s just that I was tucker- 
ed out from staying up late 
worrying about little Egbert. 
How is Eggie? Did he pull 
through the crisis okay?” 

“You fiend!” Marta wailed. 
“Out son’s name is Augustus!” 
“Ah — I was thinking of Au- 
gustus, of course.” Max scram- 
bled for verbal footing. “Today’s 
the day of the Little League try- 
outs, right? And — ” 

“Monster! You don’t know 
your real family from that hor- 
rible TV family of yours! It’s 
that nasty little midget that plays 
Sammy Osgood that’s the ball 
player! Our Augustus plays the 
violin!” 

“Sure — I remember perfect- 
ly! And his sister, Cluster, is a 
whiz on the glockenspiel!” 

“Murderer! Our daughter’s 
name is Finette! And she hates 
German food! I’m through with 
you, you . you Bluebeard!” 
She turned to flee. As Lew jump- 
ed after her, Carla aimed a 
roundhouse slap that connected 
with a loud report.

“Keep away from me, you de- 
viate!” she yelped. 

“Look at that hair-do,” Abe 
mourned. 

“Mr. Fleischpultzer!” a pene- 
trating voice sounded. A small, 
pouty-faced man in an expensive 
gray Gooberlon executive cover- 
all had appeared. 

“Why — if it isn’t the sponsor, 
Mr. Harlowe Goober of Goober 
Industries,” Hugo babbled. “Wel- 
come to the set, Mr. Goober, 
which we were just horsing 
around a little, you know, high 
spirits and all that — ” 

“I’m canceling the show,” Goo- 
ber barked. “I’ve noticed for 
some time the gradual disinte- 
gration of the moral tone of this 
network. This orgy is the final 
straw. I’m taking my trade to 
NABAC!” 

“But — Mr. Goober — ” 
“UNLESS — that person is re- 
placed at once!” Goober pointed 
dramatically at Lew Jantry. 

“But . but . but ... his con- 
tract!” Hugo blurted. “And 
what about the script? They’re 
about to have a baby!” 

“Let him die in childbirth,” 
Goober proposed, and stamped 
off the set. 

4 4 ]\/T y lawyer will call you, 
bum!” Marta shrilled. 
“Married to an actor is bad 
enough — but an out-of-work ac- 
tor ....!”

“But the Guild,” Lew rallied 
weakly. “Hugo, say something!” 
“Half the Guild’s working 
on Goober-sponsored accounts,” 
Fleischpultzer shrugged. “They 
won’t buck him.” 

“We’ll have him suicide when 
it comes out he’s an embezzler,” 
Carla’s voice sounded above the 
hubbub. “And I’ll meet that 
handsome obstetrician . .” 
“You mean — ” Lew swallow- 
ed hard, watching the set empty 
as all personnel moved to disas- 
sociate themselves from failure. 
“You mean I’m washed up in 
TV? But what will I do? All 
those hours of leisure time.” 
“View TV,” Hugo said. “Or 
maybe get a job in a factory.” 
“And stand by an automated 
machine two hours a day, watch- 
ing telly? You don’t understand, 
Hugo! I’m an artist, not a ... a 
drone!” 

“Well . there is just one re- 
mote possibility,” Hugo said re- 
luctantly. “But no — you 
wouldn’t go for it.” 

“Anything!” Lew said hastily. 
“Anything at all, Hugo!” 

“Well — if I work it right, I 
think I can get you a spot in a 
new documentary.” 

“I’ll take it!” 

“Sign here!” Hugo whipped out 
a thick bundle of contract docu- 
ments. Lew grabbed the pen. 

“I’ll be in a star slot, of 
course?” 


GALAXY 


“Natcherally. Would I do you 
that way?” 

Lew signed. “Thanks a million, 
Hugo.” He sighed, gathering his 
blanket about him. “What set do 
I report to?” 

Hugo shook his head. “No set, 
Lew. The pic ain’t being shot 
here.” 

“You don’t mean — not — not 
on location?” 

“You guessed it.” 

“Omigod. Where?” 

“A place called Byrdland.” 
“Birdland?” Lew brightened. 
“Byrdland. It’s in Antarctica.” 

II 

C i T t’s the biggest, finest Eski- 
mo reservation on the 
globe!” Hugo’s parting words 
rang in Lew Jantry’s ears as he 
peered out through the bubble 
canopy of the automatic one-pas- 
senger flitter that was ferrying 
him on the last stage of the jour- 
ney south. Across the blue-black 
sheen of the South Polar Sea, a 
line of dazzling white cliffs loom- 
ed ahead. Dropping rapidly, the 
machine skimmed low over the 
peaks, settling toward a rugged 
terrain resembling nothing so 
much as a vast frosted cake, a 
jumble of glassy blocks and 
smooth-drifted whiteness. Now he 
could make out the porous tex- 
ture of the surface below, the net- 
work of wind-scoured ridges 
THE BIG SHOW 


rushing up at him with surpris- 
ing swiftness — 

At the last possible instant, 
Lew realized that the robot voice 
of the autopilot, over the rushing 
of the wind, was squawking 
“MAYDAY! MAYDAY!” He 
grabbed the safety-frame lever, 
yanked it hard in the same mo- 
ment that the craft struck with 
an impact that turned the uni- 
verse into a whirling pinwheel of 
stars. 

It seemed like a long time be- 
fore pieces stopped raining down 
around him. Lew kicked free of 
the frame, dropped to the hard 
ground. The crash had burst the 
pod of the copter like a pump- 
kin, but he himself seemed to be 
intact. The weather suit was 
keeping him warm, in spite of 
the stiff wind that whipped the 
floury snow against his legs. Lew 
shaded his eyes and stared out 
across the desolate landscape. No 
sign of the Eskimo agent’s of- 
fice, or even of the tribal struc- 
tures of the aborigines. Lew 
snorted. He’d invoke Section 
Nine, Paragraph Three of his 
contract on this one, all right — 
the part that provided bonuses 
for inconvenience occasioned by 
inadequate travel and housing 
accommodations for artists on 
field assignment. And the hard- 
ship clause would come in, too. 
Oh, boy, wait till he got hold of 
Hugo, he’d make that shrewdie 

1 77 


regret the day he fast-talked Lew 
Jantry into a fiasco like this one. 

He flipped back the cover of 
his wristphone and snapped an 
order to the operator. There was 
no reply. He raised his voice, then 
held the tiny transceiver to his 
ear. The reassuring carrier tone 
was conspicuously lacking. 

CC-pvamn!” Lew yelled, then 

-•-^swallowed hard as the true 
seriousness of his plight struck 
him. Marooned — God knew 
how far from the nearest food, 
shelter and TV. And no one 
would know precisely where he 
was. The malfunctioning copter 
could have wandered a hundred 
miles off course since Tierra, for 
all he knew. In fact, he was lucky 
to have hit land at all, with all 
that ocean out there. 

Lew shuddered and checked 
his pockets, found nothing but 
the regulation ration capsules 
and a book of matches. The cop- 
ter yielded a road map of Chili- 
cothe County, Kansas, and a 
package of welfare- issue contra- 
ceptive devices. He tried the 
panel TV, caught a much-distort- 
ed snatch of Matty Snell, Triga- 
mist, but the picture rippled into 
static. Too bad : it was one of the 
few shows he enjoyed, a wild sit- 
com that he liked to view while 
on-camera, listening to Carla 
make chit-chat to bring late 
tuners-in up to date. 

178 


But he had more important 
things than Marty Snell to 
worry about now. The reserva- 
tion was only a couple of miles 
inland. Maybe he could see it 
from the ridge ahead. It wouldn’t 
hurt to walk that far. He faced 
into the Antarctic wind and start- 
ed across the treacherous footing. 

He had gone a hundred yards 
when a sound behind him made 
him look back. A large polar bear 
had appeared beside the heli. 
The monster circled the downed 
machine, his mouth open like an 
awe-struck yokel. The fanged 
head turned toward Lew, afford- 
ing him a horrifying view down 
the creature’s throat. It stared at 
him for a long beat, then started 
toward him at an easy lope. Lew 
stifled a yell and sprinted for 
the ridge with a speed that would 
have astonished his fans. 

Heavy pads thudded close be- 
hind as he bounded across a 
rough stretch, hit a glass-smooth 
patch and went down, skidded 
twenty yards on his back, came 
to his feet scrambling for footing 
among the tumbled slabs at the 
base of the rise. He hauled him- 
self upslope on all fours, spur- 
red by the buzzing sound of ur- 
sine breath behind him, reached 
the crest — and a squat, fur- clad 
figure rose up before him, rais- 
ing a short-hafted harpoon with 
a murderous hooked blade. For 
an instant the Eskimo poised, 

GALAXY 


arm back, his teeth bared in a 
ferocious grin. Then he hurled 
the spear. 

As the weapon shot forward, 
Lew dived under it. He hit the 
smaller man amidships, carried 
him with him in a wild tumble 
down the opposite slope. At the 
bottom, Lew crawled clear, look- 
ed up dazedly just in time to 
see the yellow-white bulk of the 
bear hurtling down directly on 
him, jaws agape. 

T ew awoke, staring up at the 

1 glossy white curve of a ceil- 
ing only three feet above his face, 
through which pale sunlight fil- 
tered. He turned his head, saw 
a grinning, brown-faced man in 
a Gooberplast playsuit sitting 
cross-legged on a synthetic bear- 
skin rug, laying out a hand of 
solitaire. It was cool, Lew thought 
confusedly, but not as cold as he’d 
have expected in a building made 
of ice. He reached up and touch- 
ed the ceiling. It was pleasantly 
warm to the touch, and dry. At 
that moment, he noticed a low 
hum in the background. 

“No,” he said, shaking his head. 
“It can’t be an ... an . .” 

“An air-conditioned igloo?” the 
card-player inquired in a deep 
voice. “Why not? You Gringos 
think us ’Skimos got no rights?” 

“It’s not that,” Lew stuttered, 
sitting up. His head ached abom- 
inably. “It’s just that . well 
THE BIG SHOW 



. it’s hardly what I expected. 
Say — ” he broke off, remember- 
ing the encounter on the ridge — 
“are you the fellow with the 
spear?” 

“Right. Charlie Urukukaluku- 
ku’s the name. Charlie Kuku 
for short. TWAG, Local 3498. 
I’m not really an actor, I’m a 
cameraman. I just do the oc- 
casional walk-on when we’re 
short of extras.” He held out a 
well manicured hand. 

“You’re a member of the 
Guild?” Lew blurted, taking the 
proffered member. 

“Sure. You don’t think we’re 
letting scabs work down here in 
Byrdland, I hope.” 

“You mean the business with 
the bear — and the spear — the 
Whole thing was just a skit?” 
“Hardly a skit, Jantry. An im- 
portant human document, de- 
lineating the plight of the haugh- 
ty Kabloona when plummeted in- 
to the harsh Antarctic environ- 
ment to which he has driven the 
patient Eskimo.” 

“That sounds like Hugo 
Fleischpultzer. And when did the 
white man ever drive the Eski- 
mo into a harsh environment?” 
“About fifty thousand years 
ago. Didn’t you ever view 
any anthropology on educational 
TV?” 

“Is that why you tried to stick 
me with that bloody great har- 
poon?” 

180 


“Stick you? Are you kidding? 
I tossed it -a good quarter inch 
wild.” 

“And what about the bear? He 
wasn’t kidding!” 

6 C~\Teah — too bad about that. 

* Busted wide open. One of 
Hugo’s ideas. It was a mech, you 
know. We got no live ones 
around, except a couple in the 
zoo. Too hot for ’em, since the 
big melt.” 

“Hot? Out there in all that 
ice?” 

“What ice? Project Defrost 
cleared all that away years ago. 
But tourists come all this way to 
see Eskimos in their native 
habitat, they want to see snow. 
So — snow they get. Plastic 
snow, like this igloo.” 

“A plastic igloo?” 

“Sure. It’s part of the Native 
Village. A big grosser.” 

“But — - why a mechanical 
bear?” 

“The bear houses the number 
two aux camera. It shoots 
through the mouth. I was remot- 
ing it from the ridge. Got some 
swell shots of the clobber-in, then 
tried to dolly in for some CU’s 
of you encountering the savage 
natives — that’s me — ” 

“How did you know where I 
was going to crash?” 

“Think I can’t read a script? 
I was out there a good hour 
early, picking my camera angles. 

GALAXY 


I got to hand it to you. You 
made it look good, Jantry. I was 
surprised to see you walk away 
from it.” 

“I made it look good?” Lew 
yelped. “Are you kidding? That 
thing was on full automatic the 
Whole time — ” He broke off. 
“Hugo planned it that way! He 
programmed the heli to crash — 
with me in it!” 

“So? It figures. But it worked 
out okay. I got the death scene in 
the can. Great footage.” 

“Death scene?” 

“Sure, I try to save you with 
my trusty spear, but the bear gets 
the both of us. It’s the Noble 
Savage Gives Life for Paleface 
bit; wows ’em in the sticks.” 

“But — I came here to make 
a ninety-hour documentary on 
the colorful natives! Why kill me 
off in the opening sequence?” 
Lew broke off as a man in a 
gray coverall appeared on all 
fours in the entry tunnel, push- 
ing a briefcase ahead of him. 

“Thanks for sitting in for me, 
Charlie,” he said to the Eskimo. 
“If you’ll excuse us now, I’d like 
a word in private with Mr. Jan- 
try.” 

“Sure.” Charlie left. The new- 
comer rose, dusted his knees, 
showed Lew a small gold badge 
pinned inside his lapel. 

“I’m Clabbinger, CIA,” he 
said. “I can understand your con- 
fusion, Jantry. Of course the busi- 
THE BIG SHOW 


ness of a role was merely a cover 
story enabling us to spirit you 
out of the States without attract- 
ing attention.” 

“Huh?” Lew said. 

“Your true destination is the 
South Pacific Nature Reserve; 
place called the Cannibal Is- 
lands,” the CIA man said crisp- 
ly. “And it’s not a play, Jantry. 
It’s for real.” 

Ill 

T ew stood on the deck of the 
■*— ' 1 LSP, shivering. 

“The whole thing is illegal,” 
he complained for the seventy- 
third time to Clabbinger, who 
stood impassively beside him, 
looking out through the pre- 
dawn mist toward the distant 
sound of surf. “I see now it was 
a putup job from the beginning: 
me getting fired, the phoney doc- 
umentary — and now this! 
Threatening to blackball me in 
the industry if I don’t sign a 
paper saying I volunteered!” 

“It’s your patriotic duty,” the 
CIA man said calmly. “We know 
something’s going on inside the 
reserve. Naturally, we can’t just 
blunder in and demand to search 
the entire archipelago.” 

“Why not?” 

“Policy,” Clabbinger said 
tersely. “Now, as I said, some- 
one — no doubt in the service of 
a Certain Power — ” 


181 


“You mean Russia, don’t you?” 
“Please, let’s keep it imper- 
sonal. Now, these Russians — I 
mean this Certain Power has in- 
filtrated the Reserve in defiance 
of solemn international commit- 
ments and has set up some sort 
of secret installation — ” 

“How do we know that?” 

“Our intrepid undercover men 
on the island reported it. Now, 
just what they’re up to, we don’t 
know. That’s your job, Jantry: to 
tell us.” 

“Why do they want to make a 
reserve out of these Godforsaken 
islands anyway?” Lew burst out. 
“If it wasn’t for that , there 
wouldn’t be any place for the, 
uh, Certain Power to set up 
secret installations in!” 

“Opening the islands would 
destroy a cultural museum that 
can never be duplicated,” Clab- 
binger said indignantly. “This is 
the only spot on earth where 
cannibalism and head-hunting 
still flourish, uncontaminated by 
automation. And the diseases — 
why, if we let antibiotics in, hun- 
dreds of unique organisms would 
be rendered extinct overnight!” 
“Why don’t you send a regular 
agent into this pest-hole?” Lew 
demanded. “Why me?” 

“We need an accomplished ac- 
tor to carry this off, Jantry. An 
ordinary agent would be incap- 
able of passing hirnself off as a 
long-lost tribe member returning 
182 


home after having been carried 
out to sea at the age of four 
in a paddleless canoe. He’d be 
caught and tortured to death in 
a most gruesome fashion.” 

CtQwell,” Lew groaned. “I 
^ either go and get roasted in 
my sarong, or refuse and never 
work again.” 

“Still — if you survive, I per- 
sonally assure you you’ll find 
your contract at Void Produc- 
tions renewed for a long term at 
a substantial increase.” 

“What good’s a substantial in- 
crease, with ninety-five per cent 
going for taxes?” Lew inquired 
gloomily. 

“Prestige,” Clabbinger pointed 
out. “And if it weren’t for the tax 
level, corporations wouldn’t al- 
locate the large tax-exempt ad- 
vertising budgets needed to sup- 
port over three hundred major 
TV networks with round-the- 
clock programming, nor would we 
enjoy the enlightened legislation 
that provides every citizen with 
a subsistence allowance, plus lei- 
sure time to view — and thus 
you’d be out of work.” 

“All right,” Lew snarled. “I 
guess you’ve got me boxed — 
but these damned shark’s-teeth 
earplugs hurt like hell!” 

“Ah, that sounds a little more 
like Daredevil Jack, star of the 
show of the same name!” Clab- 
binger clapped Lew heartily on 

GALAXY 


the back. “I’ll confide that I al- 
ways admired you in that one.” 

“I hated it,” Lew said. “I was 
always afraid of the rest of the 
cast, they talked so tough.” 

A man had come up beside the 
G-man. “Half a mile off shore,” 
he muttered. “This is as far as I 
can go without tripping the de- 
tectors.” 

“Well, Lew, this is it,” Clab- 
binger said sternly, shaking the 
actor’s hand. “Remember: as 

soon as you’ve located the site 
and beamed me the coordinates, 
get out fast! We’ll drop a mega- 
tonner right down their stack six 
minutes later, and let them com- 
plain to the UN!” 

“just don’t forget to have that 
sub standing by in case I come 
paddling out from shore in a hell 
of a hurry,” Lew said bitterly. 

Three minutes later, squatting 
in the outrigger canoe, he was 
gliding toward the palm-fringed 
shoreline ahead. The surf, though 
noisy, was not excessively high. 
He rode a long swell in, ground- 
ed on a sandy beach. He sprang 
from the boat listening alertly for 
any indication that his approach 
had been observed. Stealthily, he 
moved toward the shelter of the 
trees. Ten feet from his goal, a 
beam of dazzling white light 
speared out from the darkness 
to catch him full in the eyes. 
Blinded, he stumbled back, heard 
the quick rasp of feet — 

THE BIG SHOW 


A bomb exploded in his skull. 
He was dimly aware of falling, of 
being roughly rolled on his back. 

“Nuts,” a hoarse voice grated. 
“It’s just another lousy native. 
Shoot the bum and let’s get back 
to work.”” 

C 4 T Trait!” another, more gut- 
' ’ tural voice spoke up. 
“Don’t shoot dog of native. Noise 
might bring unwelcome atten- 
tion. Instead, tie up and dump 
out of way someplace.” 

Lew struggled feebly as hard 
hands threw multiple loops of 
hemp around his wrists and 
ankles, jammed a wad of oily 
cloth in his mouth. A man caught 
his shoulders, another his feet; 
they carried him well up into the 
jungle and dropped him into a 
clump of palmetto. Feet crashed 
through the underbrush, receding. 
Silence fell. 

The night breeze stirred the 
fronds above Lew. Mosquitoes 
whined about his ears. He 
struggled onto his back, spitting 
leaf mould past the crude 
gag. Abruptly, something buzzed 
sharply, back of his right ear. 
Lew stiffened, waiting the bite 
of the deadly snake — 

“Hello?” a tinny voice said. 
“Clabbinger to special agent LJ. 
Good work Boy! My instruments 
indicate you’ve penetrated the 
beach and are now behind the 
enemy lines! However, 1 note 

183 


you’re lying doggo. Let’s not be 
too cautious. Remember Dare- 
devil Jack! Play this one the way 
he would! Go get ’em, tiger! We’re 
rooting for you! Clabbinger out.” 
“Hello?” Lew whispered. “Hel- 
lo? Clabbinger?” 

There was no answer. Lew 
groaned. Why hadn’t they in- 
cluded a two-way connection? 
But who would have thought 
there’d be any need, with the 
tight-beam signaler tucked in his 
sarong to pinpoint the target for 
the missile strike? And anyway, 
Clabbinger wouldn’t move a foot 
to help him; he’d told him that. 

Lew took a deep breath and 
concentrated, the way he always 
did when slipping into a demand- 
ing role. 

“All right, Russkis,” Daredevil 
Jack breathed. “You started it. 
Now get ready for a counter-at- 
tack by the Free Enterprise sys- 
tem!” 

IV 

npen minutes later, Daredevil 
•*“ Jack, free of his amateurish- 
ly tied bonds, raised his head and 
peered past the fronds at the 
half-dozen figures grouped before 
a small tent from which the yel- 
low glow of a lantern shone on a 
map table where a brightly color- 
ed eighteen-inch disk lay. If he 
could get a little closer, make 
out the markings .... 

; 184 


Flat on his stomach, Jack 
inched .nearer. The men around 
the table seemed to be engaged 
in a heated argument, although 
keeping their voices low. One 
shook his fist under another’s 
nose. A third man stepped be- 
tween them. No doubt a dispute 
over the, details of their treach- 
ery. Jack studied the palm trees 
just ahead. From the top of one, 
it might be possible to make out 
the details of the chart, using the 
small ’tronscope Clabbinger had 
supplied. 

It was the work of another 
sweaty five minutes to reach the 
trees, shin up the curving trunk, 
and take up a position among 
the coconuts. Swiftly, Jack un- 
dipped the scope, fine-focused 
the UV beam, adjusted the aper- 
ture. There! The red-orange 
coloring of the target leaped into 
clarity, a maze of complex mark- 
ings. It was obviously a detailed 
relief map, the roughly circular 
shape indicating the island’s out- 
line, with mountains, valleys, 
rivers all delineated in vivid pig- 
ments. And there — that was 
doubtless the location of the ille- 
gal site. Jack studied the black 
circle, nestled between a sardine- 
shaped lake and what appeared 
to be a sliver of salami. The cir- 
cle itself showed a remarkable 
resemblance to a slice of ripe 
olive. 

“I told you, I can’t eat pizza!” 

GALAXY 


A vagrant breeze wafted a scrap 
of conversation to Jack. “I hate 
Mexican food!” 

“Damn!” Lew Jantry mutter- 
ed. He scanned past the dispu- 
tants, surveyed the remains of a 
camp fire, a heap of empty TV 
dinner cartons, settled on a hud- 
dled figure lying in the shadows 
of a flowering bush. He made out 
a vividly colored sarong, a mass 
of dark, wavy hair, a pair of slen- 
der ankles, bound with rope. 

“It’s a native girl,” Lew mut- 
tered. “They’ve got her tied up, 
the rats!” He lowered the scope, 
frowning thoughtfully. 

Maybe, Daredevil Jack 
thought, she’s been in the camp 
long enough to have heard 
something. And even if she. 
hasn’t her people will be grate- 
ful enough for her release to give 
me a hand in finding that Rus- 
sion installation . 

Silently, smiling a grim smile, 
Daredevil Jack descended to 
the ground, began a circuituous 
approach to the spot where the 
captive girl lay. 

Qhe watched him with wide eyes 
^ as he sawed at her ropes with 
a bit of sharp-edged sea-shell. 

“Shhh!” he admonished as he 
pulled away the gag to reveal a 
remarkably pretty face, olive 
brown, pert-nosed, red-lipped. 
She looked around fearfully, then 
at Jack. 

THE BIG SHOW 


“Aholui thanks you,” she 
breathed. 

“Time for thanks later,” Jack 
said kindly but firmly. “We’re 
not out of this yet.” He took her 
hand, helped her to her knees. 
“The coast is clear this way.” 
They had gone approximately 
ten feet when a bush parted just 
ahead, and a man appeared, but- 
toning his clothes. For an instant, 
his eyes and Jack’s locked. 

“What th — ” he started as 
Jack’s head rammed him square- 
ly in the belt buckle. He went 
down hard as Lew Jantry stag- 
gered to his feet, rubbing his neck 
and uttering small cries. 

“Let’s get out of here!” 
Aholui grabbed his hand and 
hauled him off down a winding 
path into the deep jungle as 
questioning shouts rose behind 
them. 

4 4 ¥ don’t care . if they do 
catch us . .” Lew gasped, 
flopping down and sucking air 
into his lungs. “I’m all in!!” 
“Not much farther now,” the 
girl said. “You must have been 
living soft out there in the great 
outside world, or wherever it was 
you said you’ve been.” 

A gusty wind had risen; a sud- 
den heavy splatter of rain rattled 
on the palmettos. Lew got to his 
feet, rubbing at the gooseflesh on 
his arms. 

“What a place,” he carped. 

185 



GALAXY 



“One minute you’re broiling, the 
next you’re freezing. Where are 
we going, anyway?” 

“To a place where we’ll be safe 
from the white-eyes,” Aholui 
said. “Up there.” She pointed. 
In the sudden vivid glare of a 
flash of lightning, Lew saw a 
rugged volcanic peak thrusting 
up above the wind-lashed palm 
trees. The rain struck then, like 
a battery of fire hoses. Stum- 
bling, colliding with trees in the 
dark, his hide rasped by sharp- 
edged tropical shrubbery, Lew 
followed as the girl led the way 
toward the high ground. 

It might have been half an 
hour later — or half of eternity 
— before Lew dragged himself 
over a rocky ledge and lay flat, 
breathing heavily. Before him, tire 
dark mouth of a cave opened. 
With his last strength, he 
crawled to it, and inside. With 
tire girl tugging at his arm, he 
managed to negotiate a sharp 
turn, and was in a low-ceilinged 
chamber twelve feet on a side. 
He propped himself against the 
wall and wiped the water from 
his eyes. Aholui seated herself be- 
side him. 

“Now, tell me again,” she said. 
“What were you doing down 
there in the outlanders’ camp?” 

“You remember — about the 
plot they’re hatching. You never 
have told me why they had you 
tied up.” 


THE BIG SHOW

V 


“They caught me snooping 
around.” 

Lew put a sympathetic arm 
around the girl’s shoulders. “The 
rotters!” he said. “Just because 
you were curious about a bunch 
of foreign devils invading the 
place.” 

Alohui shrugged his arm off. 
“Can’t blame them,” she said. “I 
really was way outside the tribal 
turf.” 

“Nonsense! The whole island 
belongs to you. Now — ” he rein- 
sinuated his arm — “if you’ll just 
take me to your leader . .” 
He leaned over, zeroing in on the 
girl’s half-parted lips. 

A light-bulb exploded in his 
ear, accompanied by a ringing 
sound. 

“Carla,” Lew mumbled dazed- 
'ly. “I just had the craziest 
dream . .” 

The girl was standing by the 
wall, fumbling with a bump on 
the stone. With a soft whine of 
well oiled machinery, a panel slid 
back to reveal a well equipped 
laboratory. 

A rather broad-shouldered 
young man in a white coat and 
a white-haired oldster looked up 
in surprise. 

“Grab this cluck, George,” 
Aholui said, jerking a thumb at 
Lew. 

“He’s some kind of Inter- 
pol fink, or I’ll eat a bunch of 
bananas, insides and all!” 

188 


Qtrapped to a chair, with a 
^ lump on his head that throb- 
bed in time with his pulse, Lew 
Jantry stared from the grim-eyed 
girl to the square- jawed young 
man to the elderly one, who re- 
turned the look through a set of 
half-inch thick trifocals. 

“You think you can kidnap a 
federal agent and get away with 
it?” he demanded in a tone that 
quavered only slightly. 

No one bothered to answer the 
question. 

“It was pretty slick, the way 
he handled it,” the girl said. “He 
pretended to be rescuing me — 
as if anyone could really sneak 
into that campful of Feds, with 
guards posted every ten feet, and 
cut somebody loose. Then, as 
soon as he thought I thought I 
was in the clear, he started pour- 
ing on the oil and pumping me 
for information.” 

“I did not!” Lew cut in. “I 
only wanted to kiss you. I 
thought they were the crooks.” 
He broke off, staring at the old 
man. “Say, don’t I know you?” 

“Maybe.” The white head 
nodded. “Lots of people used to, 
before I decided to Get Away 
From it All.” 

“Rex Googooian, the Armenian 
Valentino!” Lew gasped. “You 
used to be the biggest draw on 
the whole early mid-morning 

GALAXY 


sector! Every middle-aged, house- 
wife in America was in loye with 
you! And then you dropped out 
of sight a few years ago, blop, 
just like that!” 

“Yes indeed,” Googooian 
nodded. “It dawned on me one 
day that I had only a few years 
left in which to expiate the crimes 
I’d been practicing for thirty 
years.” 

“Crimes?” 

“Did you ever notice the di- 
alogue on the early mid-morning 
sector?” the aged actor inquired 
succinctly. “So I came here — 
secretly, of course — bringing 
with me my daughter, Baby 
Lou.” He nodded toward Aholui, 
who was vigorously scrubbing 
away her tan make-up. 

“ — and my assistant, George. 
And a considerable stock of 
equipment, of course.” 

“But that must have cost a 
fortune!” 

“I had one. And what better 
way to employ it than in putting 
an end to the pernicious plague 
that for the better part of eighty 
years had been rising like 
a flood of materialistic mediocri- 
ty, drowning our culture in its 
infancy?” 

“Plague? You mean you’re do- 
ing dandruff research?” Lew 
groped. 

“I refer,” Googooian said in 
implacable tones, “to the great- 
est menace in the world today!” 
THE BIG SHOW 


“What menace? Cuba? Nepal? 
Lebanon?” 

“Think of it!” Googooian’s 
eyes lit with a messianic fervor. 
“No more commercials, no more 
sitcoms, no quizzes, no panels, no 
more pomaded heads huddled to- 
gether, staring with vacuous, 
counterfeit smiles from flickering 
screens, no more idiotic dialogue, 
no more cardboard characteriza- 
tions, no more creaking plots, no 
more moronic villains and sweep- 
stake-winning heroes, no more 
mummified sex appeal, no more 
relatives of producers posing as 
Thespians — ” 

“Are you trying to say — no 
more television?” Lew choked the 
words out. 

“In approximately seven 
hours,” Googooian stated firmly, 
“TV broadcasting will come to a 
halt. Worldwide! Forever!” 

tC\7"ou’re out of your mind!” 
* Lew blurted. “That’s im- 
possible!” 

“Is it!” Googooian smiled sar- 
donically. “I believe otherwise. 
You’ve heard of the Van Allen 
Radiation belts?” 

“Is that like those suspenders 
that glow in the dark?” Lew 
hazarded. 

“Not quite. They are layers 
of high-energy charged particles 
two thousand and twelve thou- 
sand miles above the earth, re- 
spectively. They are of interest 

189 


here only in that the Googooian 
Belt will in some ways resemble 
them. I have prepared a rocket, 
sir, housed here in the volcano’s 
crater, which, when fired, will 
ascend to an altitude of 1500 
miles, and there assume an orbit 
which will carry it over every 
point on the planet in the first 
fifty revolutions — about seven- 
ty-two hours. As it travels, it 
will release a steady stream of 
very specially charged particles 

— particles which will emit 
electromagnetic impulses creating 
a powerful static interference 
across the entire broadcast band! 
Every station on the planet will 
be drowned in a pure noise sig- 
nal. TV, sir, is dead!” 

“You can’t!” Lew protested. 
“What will all those people do, 
left with twenty-two hours a day 
of leisure time on their hands? 
What will the sponsors do with 
all that ad money? Society as we 
know it will collapse!” 

“You’ve been brainwashed,” 
George spoke up coldly. “You 
and the rest of those FBI smar- 
ties down there. If you know so 
much, why have you been pok- 
ing around the island for six 
months without finding us?” 

“We haven’t — I mean, I did 

— I mean — oh, what’s the use?” 
Lew buried his face in his hands. 
“I’m a failure,” his muffled 
voice stated mournfully. “And 
Clabbinger was counting on me!” 

190 


Googooian came over to pat 
him consolingly on the shoulder. 
“Why not lend a hand with the 
gear?” he suggested in a fatherly 
tone. “Afterwards you’11 feel bet- 
ter, knowing you played a part 
in the liberation of man from 
electronic tyranny.” 

“Never!” Lew yelled. “First, 
I’ll — ” he broke off as a chirp- 
ing voice rasped in his left ear: 
“Operative LJ, Clabbinger 
here. I see you’ve moved inland 
to a point at the approximate 
center of the island. I’m expect- 
ing to pick up a pulse from that 
signaler any time now, pinpoint- 
ing that target. Keep up the 
good work! Over and out.” 

L ew Jantry’s heart took a great 
leap, then settled down to a 
steady thudding. He’d totally 
forgotten the signaler, but his 
course was plain. All he had to 
do was reach the button with his 
fingertips and send out the pulse 
that would bring a megatonner 
screaming in on the hidden 
launch pad. Googooian’s mad 
scheme would go up in radioac- 
tive gas. 

And Lew Jantry along with 
it. 

“You knew,” he whispered. 
“Clabbinger, you monster, you 
knew all along it was a suicide 
mission!” 

“Ah, beginning to have some 
second thoughts, eh?” Googooian 

GALAXY 


said cheerfully. “Beginning to see 
that you’re a mere dupe of the 
vested interests that are reducing 
the nation to a common level 
of imbecility, eliminating litera- 
cy, callousing esthetic sensibili- 
ties, and imposing a shabby stan- 
dard of mercantile expedi- 
ency and conformity to a false 
and superficial ideal of synthetic 
glamour!” 

“Something like that,” Lew 
muttered. His fingers inched their 
way toward the concealed signal- 
er. 

“If you’ll give me your parole, 
I’ll untie you,” the ex-actor pro- 
posed. “George and I could real- 
ly use some help with the last- 
minute details.” 

“Well . ” Lew stalled. His 
finger touched the button. He 
gritted his teeth — and stiffened 
as the pickup behind his left ear 
clicked suddenly. 

“ Hello ?” a brisk voice chirped. 
“Oh, it’s you Simenov . uh- 
huh, in about six hours . ... Of 
course it’ll work! Why do you 
lousy Commies hire American 
technicians if you don’t have con- 
fidence?” There was a length 
pause. “Look, you have your pro- 
gramming ready, that’s all! I’ll 
guarantee we’ll blanket every 
channel of television on the 
planet. The Commie line will be 
coming out of every TV set on 
the North and South American 
continents! And there’s no possi- 
THE BIG SHOW 


hie way they can Stop it! Not 
with a transmitter sunk below 
the Mohorovicic Discontinuity in 
an insulated vault, powered by 
the core heat! Not when you’re 
using the whole planet’s fluid 
interior as an antenna! It’s all 
set! Stop worrying and synchro- 
nize watches! We throw the 
switches at six AM on the dot!” 
There was a sharp click! fol- 
lowed by silence. 

“Ye Gods!” Lew mumbled. 
“Two targets — and only one 
bomb!” He swallowed hard, his 
thoughts racing. 

“Googooian,” he barked. “Are 
you sure this invention of yours 
will blanket all television, not 
just part of it?” 

“Absolutely!” 

“What about a super-powerful 
station?” 

Googooian chuckled. “All the 
better. The particles will absorb 
and re-radiate as noise any im- 
pinging electra-magnetic radia- 
tion. The more energetic, the 
better.” 

“Sold!” Lew said. “I’ll help 
you! Get these ropes off and let’s 
get going!” 

VI 

Ophe eastern sky was heralding 
dawn with a glory of purple 
and crimson when Lew, Googoo- 
ian, George and Baby Lou re- 
tired to the blockhouse carved 

191 


deep in the flank of the moun- 
tain, and grouped themselves 
around the rocket control con- 
sole. Solemnly, the aging actor- 
tumed-researcher depressed the 
firing button. A low rumble pass- 
ed through the solid rock. 

On the closed-circuit screen, 
the crater mouth erupted in 
smoke, through which a needle 
prow emerged, rising slowly at 
first, then more swiftly, mounting 
toward the cloud-dotted sky, 
trailing fire and thunder. 

“She’s off!” Googooian chor- 
tled as the others clapped him on 
the back, laughing merrily — all 
but Lew Jantry. Glumly, he 
watched the ship disappear into 
the high haze. 

“Cheer up, lad,” Googooian 
called. “It’s all for the best! 
You’ll see!” 

“Look what we’ll be missing!” 
George called cheerfully as he 
switched on the 48-inch, full-col- 
or three-D set. The screen blink- 
ed, flickered, firmed into an im- 
age of a woman with a face like 
an oversized Pekinese. 

. Dear Sally Sweetbreads, 
this viewer writes,” a high-pitch- 
ed nasal intoned. “I never miss 
your show, which is the cause 
of the trouble between my hus- 
band and me. He says it breaks 
his scene when you give some of 
that clinical-type advice just at 
the most romantic moment. 
Signed, Perplexed. Well, Fer- 
192 


plexed, assuming you don’t want 
to change husbands — ” the 
plump features compressed into 
a leer — “I’d suggest you rear- 
range the bedroom. And now — ” 

“That’s not all we’ll be miss- 
ing,” Lew snarled. “When the de- 
pression this thing causes hits, 
we’ll miss everything from meals 
to martinis! There’ll be millions 
out of work! Tax revenue will 
drop to zero! The government 
may collapse — and we’ll be 
stuck here, on this infernal is- 
land!” 

“Tsk,” Googooian said. “My 
analysis suggests that the crea- 
tive energies released from thrall- 
dom to television mania will pro- 
duce an upsurge in every facet of 
our culture. There’ll be a flower- 
ing of science and the arts to 
rival the Renaissance! Of course, 
there may be a short period of 
readjustment — say a decade. 
But no matter. We’ll be quite 
happy here. The entire interior 
of the mountain is honeycombed 
with facilities: luxurious quar- 
ters, a nuclear power plant, well 
shielded, a ten year stockpile of 
gourmet food to supplement the 
native diet, a vast library of 
books and music!” 

/^vn the screen, a loose-lipped 
young man with intent eyes 
leaned toward a jawless woman 
in a grotesque hat. 

“Mrs. Wiltoff, would you just 
GALAXY 


tell us in your own words how 
it feels to be the wife of 
the man scheduled to be gassed 
tomorrow on a nationwide hook- 
up for the brutal slaying of the 
nine chorus girls whose pictures 
you are now admiring?” 

“Well, Bob,” the interviewee 
started; abruptly, the image 
flickered, turned to a flapping 
pattern of diagonal lines. A new 
picture burned into focus over it. 
A thick-necked man with small 
eyes looked out of the screen. 

“Capitalist swine,” he began in 
a glutinous voice — and was 
drowned under a deluge of white 
blips which danced across the 
tube face, swiftly coalescing into 
a solid rectangle of glare. A roar 
like Niagara swelled to blot out 
the sound. 

“Hooray!” Googooian capered 
madly, embracing his teammates, 
while Lew wandered disconso- 
lately to the blockhouse door. 
From the tiny balcony overhang- 
ing the interior of the volcano, 
he looked down into the fire- 
blackened silo from which the 
rocket had emerged minutes be- 
fore. There was a step beside 
him. 

“Thanks for helping Pop,” 
Baby Lou said. “I expected you 
to try something, but you didn’t. 
Maybe I was wrong about you 
being a CIA man.” 

“Well . .” Lew moved closer 
to the girl, slid an arm around 
THE BIG SHOW 


her waist. “Inasmuch as we’re 
stuck here,” he said, “we may as 
well make the best of it.” 
“What’s that?” Baby. Lou felt 
over Lew’s side, plucked some- 
thing from his sarong. “It was 
sticking me,” she said and push- 
ed the button. 

“No!” Lew grabbed the signaler 
and hurled it into the pit — far 
too late. Already its tell-tale 
pulse had raced to the ship wait- 
ing hull-down over the horizon. 

“Well — I never!” Baby Lou 
snapped and marched away. 

“Everybody to the beach!” 
Lew yelled, plunging after her. 
“We’ve got six minutes before 
the island goes up in smoke!” 

Tt was a balmy evening six 
months later. Lew, Googoo- 
ian and Simenov sat under the 
thatched shelter they had con- 
structed above high tide line, 
playing a game of homemade 
dominoes by lantern light. In 
the background, a native elec- 
tric guitar band played Aloha Oe 
in time to the chugging of a por- 
table generator. 

“Tomorrow comes maybe sup- 
ply ship,” the Russian said, eye- 
ing the empty horizon. 

“I doubt it,” Googooian said. 
Baby Lou came up, trailed by 
George. No, I do not believe in 
sharing the wealth,” she was say- 
ing tartly. “Father, make George 
stop bothering me!” 


193 


“Ah — perhaps if Lew chap- 
eroned you — ” 

“I’d like to see him try, the 
lousy actor,” George snarled. 

“Oh, yeah?” Daredevil Jack 
half-rose, then sank back. “It’s 
too hot,” Lew Jantry said. 

Baby Lou sniffed and stalked 
away. George wandered off. 
Simenon glowered at the check- 
ers. 

“Now, now,” Googooian said 
in tones of forced heartiness. 
“Here we are, living in paradise, 
plenty of fruit and fresh seafood, 
sunshine every day, cool breezes 
at night, no responsibilities, no 
problems! We should all be per- 
fectly delighted!” 

“Then why aren’t we?” Lew 
demanded. 

“I tell you why,” Simenov 
stated. “Is no damned thing to 
do! Are not building socialism! 
Not even building capitalism! Is 
building only sand castles, and is 
getting pretty damn boring!” 

“Say,” Googooian said sudden- 
ly- 

What?” Lew said. 

“I was just wondering — not 
that I regret anything I’ve done, 
you understand . .” 

“Go on,” Simenov said. 

“If we used the stuff you fel- 


lows had left over — ” he eyed 
the Russian — “and if we could 
salvage a few items from the 
mountain — ” 

“Yes?” Lew and Simenov said 
in chorus. 

“We might just be able to 
tinker up a little line-of-sight rig. 
Nothing elaborate, mind you. 
Just straight black and white, 
two-D — at least at first . 

4 (, J T mmm. Is possibility.” The 
* Russian pulled at his 
lower lip. Together, the two 
technical men strolled off deep in 
conversation. Lew Jantry sat 
where he was, staring after them, 
a thoughtful look on his face. 
Then he rose, hurried toward the 
slight figure wandering lonely 
along the beach. 

“Oh, Baby Lou,” he called. 
“I’ve been meaning to ask you: 
have you ever thought of taking 
up acting as a profession?” 

“Why, Lew! Do you really 
think I might have talent?” 

“I’m sure of it. It’s just a 
matter of finding an outlet for 
it.” 

Together they strolled along 
the shore of the lagoon toward 
the silvery path of the rising 
moon. — KEITH LAUMER
