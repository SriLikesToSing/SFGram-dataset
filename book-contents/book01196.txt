GALAXY 





Gateway waa Man’s last hope. 
For those allowed to pass 
through Its portals It was 
rIchM, tame— or deathi 

I 

My name is Robinene Broadhead, 
in spite of which I am male. My 
analyst (whom I call Sigfrid von 
Shrink, although that isn’t his name; 
he hasn’t got a name, being a 
machine) has a lot of electronic fun 
with this fact; 

“Why do you care if some 
people think it’s a girl’s name. 
Bob?’’ 

“I don't.’’ 

“Then why do you keep bringing 
it up?’’ 

He annoys me when he keeps 
bringing up what I keep bringing up. 
1 look at the ceiling with its hanging 
mobiles and pihatas, then I look out 
the window. It isn’t really a win- 
dow. It’s a moving holopic of surf 
coming in on Kaena Point; Sigfiid’s 
programming is pretty eclectic. 
After a while I say, “I can’t help 
what my parents called me. I tried 
spelling it R-O-B-I-N-E-T, but then 
everybody pronounces it wrong.’’ 
“You could change it to something 
else, you know.’’ 

“If I changed it,” I say, and I 
am sure I am right in this, “you 
would just tell me I was going to 
obsessive lengths to defend my 
inner dichotomies.” 

“What I would tell you,” Sigfrid 
says, in his heavy mechanical at- 
tempt at humor, “is that, please, 
you shouldn’t use technical 
psychoanalytic terms. I’d appreciate 
it if you would just say what you 
feel.” 



“What I feel,” I say, for the 
thousandth time, “is happy. I got 
no problems. Why wouldn’t I feel 
happy?” 

We play these word games a lot, 
and I don’t like them. I think 
there’s something wrong with his 
program. He says, “You tell me, 
Robbie. Why don’t you feel 
happy?” 

I don’t say anything to that. He 
persists. “I think you’re worried.” 

“Shit, Sigfrid,” I say, feeling a 
little disgust, “you always say that. 
I’m not worried about anything.” 

He tries wheedling. “There’s 
nothing wrong with saying how you 
feel.” 

I look out the window ajgain, 
angry because I can feel myself 
trembling and I don’t know why. 
“You’re a pain in the ass, Sigfrid, 
you know that?’ ’ 

He says something or other, but I 
am not listening. I am wondering 
why I waste my time coming here. 
If tiiere was anybody ever who had 
every reason to be happy, I have to 
be him. I’m rich. I’m pretty good- 
looking. I am not too old, and any- 
way I nave Full Medical so I can 
just about any age I want to be for 
the next fifty years or so. I live in 
New York City under the Big Bub- 
ble, where you can’t afford to live 
unless you’re really well fixed, and 
maybe some kind of celebrity be- 
sides. I have a summer apartment 
that overlooks the Tappan Sea and 
the Palisades Dam. And the girls go 
crazy over my three Out bangles. 
You don’t see too many prospectors 
anywhere on Earth, not even in 
New York. They’re all wild to have 
me tell them what it’s really like 
out around the Orion Nebula or the 



6 



GALAXY 




Lesser Magellanic Cloud. (I’ve 
-lever been to either pltice, of 
course. The one really interesting 
place I’ve been to I don’t like to 
talk about.) 

“Or,” says Sigfrid, having 
waited the appropriate number of 
microseconds for a response to 
whatever it was he said last; “If 
you really are happy, why do you 
come here for help?” 

I hate it when he asks me the 
same questions I ask myself. I don’t 
answer. I squirm around until 1 get 
comfortable again on the plastic 
foam mat, because I can tell that 
it’s going to be a long, lousy ses- 
sion. If I knew why I needed help, 
why would I need help? 

“Rob, you aren’t very responsive 
today,” Sigfrid says through the lit- 
tle loudspeaker at the head of the 
mat. Sometimes he uses a very 
lifelike dummy, sitting in an 
armchair, tapping a pencil and smil- 
ing quirkily at me from time to 
time. But I’ve told him that that 
makes me nervous. “Why don’t 
you just tell me what you’re think- 
ing?” 

“I’m not thinking about any- 
thing, particularly.” 

“l^t your mind roam. Say what- 
ever comes into it. Bob.” 

“I’m remembering — ” I say, and 
stop. 

“Remembering what, Rob?” 
“Gateway?” 

“That sounds more like a ques- 
tion than a statement.” 

“Maybe it is. I can’t help that. 
That’s what I’m remembering. 
Gateway.” 

I have every reason to remember 
Gateway. That’s how I got the 
money and the bangles, and other 

GATEWAY 



things. I think back to the day I left 
Gateway. That was, let’s see. Day 
31 of Orbit 22, which means, 
counting back, just about sixteen 
years and a couple of months since 
I left there. I was thirty minutes out 
of the hospital and couldn’t wait to 
collect my pay, catch my ship and 
blow. 

Sigfrid says politely, “Please say 
what you’re thinking out loud, 
Robbie.” 

“I’m thinking about Shikitei Ba- 
kin,” I say. 

“Yes, you’ve mentioned him. I 
remember. What about him?” 

I don’t answer. Old legless 
Shicky Bakin had the room next to 
mine, but I don’t want to discuss it 
with Sigfrid. I wriggle around on 
my circular mat, thinking about 
Shicky and trying to cry. 

“You seem upset. Bob.” 

I don’t answer to that, either. 
Shicky was almost the only person I 
said good-by to on Gateway. That 
was fiirmy. There was a big differ- 
ence in our status. I was a prospec- 
tor, and Shicl^ was a garbage man. 
They paid him enough money to 
cover his life-support tax because he 
did odd jobs and even on Gateway 
they have to have somebody to 
clean up the garbage. But sooner or 
later he would be too old and too 
sick to be any more use at all. 
Then, if he was lucky, they would 
push him out into space and he 
would die. If he wasn’t lucky, they 
would send him back to Earth. He 
would die there, too, before very 
long; but first he would have the 
experience of living for a few 
weeks or so as a helpless cripple. 

Anyway, he was my neighbor. 
Every morning he would get up and 

7 




painstakingly vacuum every square dirty, because there was so much 
inch around his cell. It would be trash floating around Gateway all

the time, despite the attempts to 
clean it up. When he had it per- 
fectly clean, even around the roots 
of the little shniblets he planted and 
shaped, he would take a handful of 
pebbles, bottle caps, bits of tom 
paper — the same trash he’d just 
vacuumed up, half the time — and 
painstakingly arrange it on the place 
he had just cleaned. Funny! I never 
could see the difference, but Klara 
said — Klara said she could. 

“Bob, what were you thinking 
about just then?” Sigfiid asks. 

I roll up into a foetal ball and 
mumble something. 

“I couldn’t understand what you 
just said, Robbie.” 

I don’t say anything. I wonder 
what became of Shicky. I suppose 
he died. Suddenly I feel very sad 
about Shicky dying, such a very 
long way from Nagoya, and I wish 
again that I could cry. But I can’t. I 
squirm and wriggle. I flail against 
the foam mat until the restraining 
straps squeak. Nothing helps. The 
pain and shame won’t come out. I 
feel rather pleased with myself that 
I am trying so hard to let the feelings 
out, but I have to admit I am not 
being successful, and the dreary 
interview goes on: 

Sigfrid says, “Bob, you’re taking 
a long time to answer. Do you think 
you’re holding something back?” 

I say virtuously, “What kind of a 
question is that? If I am, how 
would I know?” I pause to survey 
the inside of my brain, looking in 
all the comers for padlocks that I 
can open for Sigfrid. I don’t see 
any. I say judiciously, “I don’t 
think that’s it, exactly. I don’t feel 
as if I were blocking. It’s more as if 
there were so many things I wanted 

gateway 



to say that I couldn’t decide 
which.” 

“Take any one, Rob. Say the 
first thing that comes into your 
mind.” 

Now, that’s dumb, it seems to me. 
How do I know which is the 
first thing, when they’re all boiling 
around in there together? My 
father? My mother? Sylvia? Klara? 
Poor Shicky, trying to balance him- 
self in flight without any legs, flap- 
ping around like a bam-swallow 
chasing bugs as he scoops the cob- 
webby scraps out of Gateway’s air? 

I reach down into my mind for 
places where I know it hurts, be- 
cause it has hurt there before. The 
way I felt when I was seven years 
old, parading up and down the 
Rock Park walk in front of the other 
kids, begging that someone would 
pay attention to me? The way it was 
when we were out of realspace and 
knew that we were trapped, with 
the ghost star coming up out of 
nothingness below us like the smile 
of die Cheshire cat? Oh, I have a 
hundred memories like those, and 
they all hurt. That is, they can. 
They are pain. They are clearly 
labeled painful in the index to my 
memory. I know where to find 
them, and I know what it feels like 
to let them surface. 

But they will not hurt unless I let 
them out. 

“I’m waiting. Bob,’’ Sigfrid 
says. 

“I’m thinking,” I say. As I lie 
there it comes to my mind that I’ll 
be late for my guitar lesson. That 
reminds me of something, and I 
look at the fingers of my left hand, 
checking to see that the fingernails 
have not grown too long, wishing 

9 




the callouses were harder and 
thicker. I have not learned to play 
the guitar very well, but most 
people are not that critical and it 
gives me pleasure. Only you have 
to keep practicing and remember- 
ing. Let’s see, I think, how do you 
m^e that transition from the D-maj 
to the C-7th again? 

“Bob,” Sigfiid says, “this has 
not been a very productive session. 
There are only about ten or fifteen 
minutes left. Why don’t you just 
say the first thing that comes into 
your mind . now.” 

I reject the first thing and say the 
second. “The first thing that comes 
into my mind is the way my mother 
was crying when my father was 
kiUed.” 

“I don’t think that was actually 
the first thing. Bob. Let me make 
a guess. Was the first thing some- 
thing about Klara?” 

My chest fills, tingling. My 
breath catches. All of a sudden 
there’s Klara rising up before me, 
sixteen years before and not yet an 
hour older. ... I say, “As a matter 
of fact, Sigfrid, I think what I want 
to talk about is my mother.” I 
allow myself a polite, deprecatory 
chuckle. 

Sigfiid doesn’t ever sigh in resig- 
nation, but he can be silent in a 
way that sounds about the same. 

“You see,” I go on, carefully 
outlining all the relevant issues, 
“she wanted to get married again 
after my father died. Not right 
away. I don’t mean that she was 
glad about his death, or anything 
like that. No, she loved him all 
right. But still, I see now, she was 
a healthy young woman — well, 
fairiy young. Let’s see, I suppose 

10 



she was about thirty-three. And if it 
hadn’t been for me I’m sure she 
would have remanied. I have feel- 
ings of guilt about that. I kept her 
from doing it. I went to her and 
said, ‘Ma, you don’t need another 
man. I’ll be the man in the family. 
I’ll take care of you.’ Only I 
couldn’t, of course. I was only 
about five years old.” 

“I think you were nine, Rob- 
bie.” 

“Was I? Let me think. Gee, Sig- 
frid, I guess you’re right — ” And 
then I try to swallow a big drop of 
spit that has somehow instantly 
formed in my throat and I gag and 
cough. 

“Say it, Rob!” Sigfrid insis- 
tently. “What do you want to 
say?” 

“God damn you, Sigfrid!” 

“Go ahead, Rob. Say it.” 

“Say what? Christ, Sigfrid! 
You’re driving me right up the 
wall! This shit isn’t doing either one 
of us any good!” 

“Say what’s bothering you. Bob, 
please.” 

“Shut your fucking tin mouth!” 
All that carefully covered pain is 
pushing its way out and I can’t 
stand it, can’t deal with it — 

“I suggest. Bob, that you try — ” 

I surge against the straps, kicking 
chunks out of the foam matting, 
roaring, “Shut up, you! I don’t 
want to hear. I can’t cope with this, 
don’t you understand me? I can’t! 
Can’t cope, can’t cope!” 

Sigfrid waits patiently for me to 
stop weeping, which happens rather 
suddenly. And then, before he can 
say anything, I say wearily, “Oh, 
hell, Sigfrid, this whole thing isn’t 
getting us anywhere. I think we 

GAIAXY 




should call it off. There must be 
other people who need your services 
more than I do. ” 

“As to that, Rob,” he says, “I 
am quite competent to meet aU the 
demands on my time.” 

I am drying my tears on the 
paper towels he has left beside the 
mat and don’t answer. 

“There is still excess capacity, in 
fact,” he goes on. “But you must 
be the judge of whether we continue 
with these sessions or not.” 

“Say, Sigfrid, have you got any- 
thing to drink in the recovery 
room?” I ask. 

“Not in the sense you mean, no. 
There is what I am told is a very 
pleasant bar on the top floor of this 
building.” 

“Well,” I say, “I Just wonder 
what I’m doing here.” 

And, fifteen minutes later, having 
confirmed my appointment for the 
next week, I am drinking a cup of 
tea in Sigftid’s recovery cubicle. I 
listen to hear if his next patient has 
started screaming yet, but I can’t 
hear anything. 

So I wash my face, adjust my 
scarf and slick down the little cow- 
lick in my hair. I go up to the bar 
for a quick one. The headwaiter, 
who is human, knows me, and 
gives me a seat looking south to- 
ward the Lower Bay rim of the 
bubble. He looks toward a tall 
copper-skinned girl with green eyes 
sitting by herself, but I shake my 
head. 

I drink one short drink, admire 
the legs on the copper-skinned girl 
and, thinking mostly about where I 
am going to go for dinner, leave to 
keep my appointment for my guitar 
lesson. 



n 

All my life I wanted to be a 
prospector, as far back as I can re- 
member. I couldn’t have been more 
than six when my father and mother 
took me to a fair in Cheyenne. Hot 
dogs and popped soya, colored 
paper hydrogen balloons, a circus 
with dogs and horses, wheels of for- 
tune, games, rides. And there was a 
pressure tent with opaque sides, a 
dollar to get in, and inside some- 
body had arranged a display of im- 
ports from the Heechee tunnels on 
Venus. Prayer fans and fire pearls, 
real Heechee-metal mirrors that you 
could buy for twenty-five dollars 
apiece. Pa said they weren’t real, 
but to me they were real. We 
couldn’t afford twenty-five dollars 
apiece, though. And when you 
came right down to it, I didn’t re- 
ally need a mirror. Freckled face, 
buck teeth, hair I brushed straight 
back and tied. They had just found 
Gateway. I heard my father talking 
about it that night in the airbus, 
going home, when I guess they 
thou^t I was asleep, but the wistful 
hunger in his voice had kept me 
awake. 

If it hadn’t been for my mother 
and me he might have found a way 
to go. But he never got the chance. 
He was dead a year later. All I in- 
herited from him was his job, as 
soon as I was big enough to hold it. 

I don’t know if you’ve ever 
worked in the food mines, but 
you’ve probably heard about them. 
There isn’t any great joy there. I 
started, half time and half pay, at 
twelve. By the time I was sixteen I 
had my father’s rating: charge 
driller — good pay, hard work.

But what can you do with the 
pay? It isn’t enoii^ for Full Medi- 
cal. It isn’t enough even to get you 
out of the mines, only enough to be 
a sort of local success story. You 
work six hours on and ten hours 
off. Eight hours sleep and you’re on 
again, with your clothes stinking of 
shale all the time. You can’t smoke, 
except in sealed rooms. The oil fog 
settles everywhere. The girls are as 
smelly and slick and frazzled as you 
are. 

So we all did the same things, we 
worked and chased each other’s 
women and played the lottery. And 
we drank a lot, the cheap, powerful 
liquor that was made not ten miles 
away. Sometimes it was labeled 
Scotch and sometimes Vodka or 
Bourbon, but it all came off the 
same slime-still columns. I was no 
different from any of the others 

12 



. except that, one time, I won 
the lottery. And that was my ticket 
out. 

Before that happened I just lived. 

My mother was a miner, too. 
After my father was killed in the 
shaft fire she brought me up, with 
the help of the company creche. We 
got along all right until I had my 
psychotic episode. I was twenty-six 
at the time. I had some trouble with 
my girl, and then for a while I just 
couldn’t get out of bed in the morn- 
ing. So they put me away. I was 
out of circulation for most of a 
year, and when they let me out of 
the shrink tank my mother had died. 

Face it: that was my fault. I don’t 
mean I planned it, I mean she 
would have lived if she hadn’t had 
me to worry about. There wasn’t 
enough money to pay the medical 
expenses for both of us. I needed 
psychotherapy. She needed a new 
lung. She didn’t get it, so she died. 

I hated living on in the same 
apartment after she was dead, but it 
was either that or go into bachelor 
quarters. I didn’t like the idea of 
living in such close proximity to a 
lot of men. Of course I could have 
got married. I didn’t — Sylvia, the 
girl I’d had the trouble with, was 
long gone by that time — but it 
wasn’t because I had anything 
against the idea of marriage. Maybe 
you might think I did, considering 
my psychiatric history, and also 
considering that I’d lived with my 
mother as long as she was alive. 
But it isn’t tme. I liked girls very 
much. I would have been very 
happy to marry one and raise a 
child. 

But not in the mines. 

I didn’t want to leave a son of 

GALAXY 




mine the way my father had left, 
me. 

Charge drilling is bitchy hard 
woric. Now they use steam torches 
with Heechee heating coils and the 
shale just politely splits away, like 
carving cubes of wax. But then we 
drilled and blasted. You’d go down 
into the shaft at the start of your 
shift on the high-speed drop. The 
shaft wall was slimy and stinking 
ten inches from your shoulder, mov- 
ing at sixty kilometers an hour rela- 
tive to you; I’ve seen miners with a 
few drinks in them stagger and 
stretch out a hand to support them- 
selves and pull back a stump. Then 
you pile out of the bucket and slip 
and stumble on the duckboards for a 
kilometer or more till you come to 
the working face. You drill your 
shaft. You set your charges. TTien 
you back out into a cul-de-sac while 
they blast, hoping you figured it 
right and the whole reeking, oily 
mass doesn’t come down on you. 
(If you’re buried alive you can live 
up to a week in the loose shale. 
People have. Usually when they 
don’t get rescued until after the 
third day they’re never any good for 
anything any more.) Then, if every- 
diing has gone all right, you dodge 
the handling loaders as they come 
creeping in on their tracks, on your 
way to the next face. 

The masks, they say, take out 
most of the hydrocarbons and the 
rock dust. They don’t take out the 
stink. I’m not sure they take out all 
the hydrocarbons, either. My 
mother is not the only miner I knew 
who needed a new lung — nor the 
only one who couldn’t pay for one, 
either. 

And then, when your shift is 
GATEWAY 



over, where is there to go? 

You go to a bar. You go to a 
dorm-room with a girl. You go to a 
recroom to play cards. You watch 
TV. 

You don’t go out doors very 
much. There’s no reason. There are 
a couple of little parks, carefully 
tended, planted, replanted; Rock 
Park even has hedges and a lawn. I 
bet you never saw a lawn that had 
to be washed, scrubbed (with deter- 
gent!) and air-dried every week, or 
it would die. So we mostly leave 
the parks to the kids. 

Apart from the parks, there is 
only the surface of Wyoming, and 
as far as you can see it loolu like 
the surface of the Moon. Nothing 
green anywhere. Nothing alive. No 
birds, no squirrels, no pets. A few 
sludgy, squdgy creeks that for some 
reason are always bright ochre-red 
under the oil. They told us that we 
were lucky at that, because our part 
of Wyoming was shaft-mining. In 
Colorado, where they strip-mined, 
things were even worse. 

I always found that hard to be- 
lieve, and still do, but I’ve never 
gone to look. 

And apart from everything else, 
there’s the smell and sight and 
sound of the work. The sunsets 
orangey-brown through the haze. 
The constant smell. All day and all 
night there’s the roar of the extrac- 
tor furnaces, heating and grinding 
the marlstone to get the kerogen out 
of it, and the rumble of the long- 
line conveyors, dragging the spent 
shale away to pile it somewhere. 

See, you have to heat the rock to 
extract the oil. When you heat it it 
expands, like popcorn. So there’s 
no place to put it. You can’t

it, or some of it, for breakfast the

Funny. In the old days oil used to 
bubble right out of the ground! And 
all people thought to do with it was 
stick it in their automobiles and 
bum it up. 

All the TV shows have morale- 
builder commercials telling us how 
important our work is, how the 
whole world depends on us for 
food. It’s all true. They don’t have 
to keep reminding us. If we didn’t 
do what we do there would be 
hunger in Texas and kwashiorkor 
among the babies in Oregon. We all 
know that. We contribute five tril- 
lion calories a day to the world’s 
diet, half the protein ration for 
about a fifth of the global popula- 
tion. It all comes out of the yeasts 
and bacteria we grow off the 
Wyoming shale oil, dong with parts 
of Utah and Colorado. The world 
needs that food. But so far it has 
cost us most of Wyoming, half of 
Appalachia, a big chunk of the 
Athabasca tar sands region . and 
what are we going to do with all 
those people when the last drop of 
hydrocarbon is converted to yeast? 

It’s not my problem, but I still 
think of it.

live too high. 

Or enough for a one-way ticket to 
Gateway. 

I took the lottery ticket down to 
the travel office and turned it in for 
passage. They were glad to see me; 
they didn’t do much of a business 
there, especially in that kind of 
commodity. I had about ten 
thousand dollars left over in change, 
give or take a little. I didn’t count 
it. I bought drinks for my whole 
shift as far as it would go. With the 
fifty people in my shift, and all the 
friends and casual drop-ins who 
leeched on to the party, it went 
about twenty-four hours. 

Then I staggered through a 
Wyoming blizzard back to the travel 
office. Five months later, I was 
circling in toward the asteroid, star- 
ing out the portholes at the Brazi- 
lian cruiser that was challenging us, 
on my way to being a prospector at 
last. 

m 

Sigfrid never closes off a subject. 
He never says, “Well, Bob, I guess 
we’ve talked enough about that.’’ 
But sometimes when I’ve been 
lying there on the mat for a long 
time, not responding much, making 
jokes or humming through my nose, 
after a while he’ll say: 

“I think we might go back to a 

GALAXY 




different area, Bob. There was 
something you said some time ago 
that we might follow up. Can you 
remember diat time, the last time 
you — ” 

“The last time I talked to Klara, 
right?” 

“Yes, Bob.” 

“Sigfrid, I always know what 
you’re going to say.” 

“Doesn’t matter if you do. Bob. 
What about it? Do you want to talk 
about how you felt that time?” 
“Why not?” I clean the nail of 
my right middle finger by drawing 
it between my two lower front 
teeth. I inspect it and say, “I 
realize that was an important time. 
Maybe it was the worst moment of 
my life, about. Even worse than 
when Sylvia ditched me, or when I 
found out my mother di^.” 

“Are you saying you’d rather 
talk about one of those things, 
Rob?” 

“Not at all. You say talk about 
Klara, we’ll talk about Klara.” 

And I settle myself on the foam 
mat and think for a while. I’ve been 
very interested in transcendental in- 
sight and sometimes when 1 set a 
problem to my mind and just start 
saying my mantra over and over I 
come out of it with the problem 
solved: Sell the fish-farm stock in 
Baja and buy plumbing supplies on 
the commodities exchange. That 
was one, and it really paid out. Or: 
Take Rachel to Merida for water- 
skiing on the Bay of Campeche. 
That got her into my bed the first 
time, when I’d tried everything 
else. 

And then Sigfrid says: 

“You’re not responding, Rob.” 
“I’m thinking about it.” 

Gateway 



“Please don’t think about it, 
Rob. Just talk. Tell me what you’re 
feeling about Klara right now.” 

I try to think it out honestly. Sig- 
frid won’t let me get into TI for it, 
so I look inside my mind for sup- 
pressed feelings. 

“Well, not much,” I say. Not 
much on the surface, anyway. 

. “Do you remember the feeling at 
the time. Bob?” 

“Of course I do.” 

“Try to feel what you felt then. 
Bob.” 

“All right.” Obediently I recon- 
struct the situation in my mind. 
There I am, talking to Klara on the 
radio. Dane is shouting something 
in the lander. We’re all fiightened 
out of our wits. Down underneath 
us the blue mist is opening up, and 
I see the dim skeletal star for the 
first time. The Three-ship . no, 
it was a Five . anyway, it stinks 
of vomit and perspiration. My body 
aches. 

I can remember it exactly, al- 
though I would be lying if I said I 
was letting myself feel it. 

I say lightly, half chuckling, 
“Sigfrid, there’s an intensity of 
pain and guilt and misery there that 
I just can’t handle.” Sometimes I 
try that with him, saying a kind of 
painful tmth in the tone you might 
use to ask the waiter at a cocktail 
party to bring you another rum 
punch. I do that when I want to 
divert his attack. I don’t think it 
works. Sigfrid has a lot of Heechee 
circuits in him. He’s a lot better 
than the machines at the Institute 
were, when I had my episode. He 
continuously monitors all my physi- 
cal parameters: skin conductivity 
and pulse and beta-wave activity 

15 




and so on. He gets readings from 
the restraining straps that hold me 
on the mat, to show how violently I 
fling myself around. He meters 
the volume of my voice and 
spectrum- scans the print for over- 
tones. And he also understands 
what the words mean. Sigfrid is ex- 
tremely smart, considering how 
stupid he is. 

It is very hard, sometimes, to 
fool him. I get to the end of a ses- 
sion absolutely limp, with the feel- 
ing that if I had stayed with him for 



one more minute I would have 
found myself falling right down into 
that pain and it would have de- 
stroyed me. 

Or cured me. Perhaps they are 
the same thing.

cleus of a comet. About ten kilome- 
ters through the longest way. Pear- 
shaped. On the outside it looks like 
a lumpy charred blob with glints of 
blue. On the inside it’s the gateway 
to the universe. 

Sheri Loffat leaned against my 
shoulder, with the rest of our bunch 
of would-be prospectors clustered 
behind us, staring. “Jesus, Bob. 
Look at the cruisers!” 

“They find anything wrong,” 
said somebody behind us, “and 
they blow us out of space.” 

“They won’t find anything 
wrong.” said Sheri, but her remark 
ended with a question mark. Those 
cruisers looked mean, circling jeal- 
ously around the asteroid, watching 
to see that whoever comes in isn’t 
going to steal the secrets that are 
worth more than anyone can ever 
pay. 

We hung to the porthole braces to 
rubberneck at them. Foolishness, 
that was. We could have been 
killed. There wasn’t really much 
likelihood that our ship’s matching 
orbit with Gateway or the Brazilian 
cruiser would take much delta-V, 
but there only had to be one quick 
course correction to spatter us. And 
there was always the other chance, 
that our ship would rotate a 
quarter-turn or so and we’d sud- 
denly find ourselves staring into the 
naked, nearby sun. That meant 
blindness for always, that close. But 
we wanted to see. 

The Brazilian cruiser didn’t 
bother to lock on. We saw flashes 
back and forth, and knew that they 
were checking our manifests by 
laser. That was normal. I said the 
cruisers were watching for thieves, 
but actually they were more to 

Gateway 



watch each other than to worry 
about anybody else. Including us. 
The Russians were suspicious of the 
Chinese, the Chinese were suspi- 
cious of the Russians, the Brazilians 
were suspicious of the Venusians. 
They were all suspicious of the 
Americans. 

So the other four cruisers were 
surely watching the Brazilians more 
closely than they were watching us. 
But we all knew that if our coded 
navicerts had not matched the pat- 
terns their five separate consulates 
at the departure port on Earth had 
filed, the next step would not have 
been an argument. It would have 
been a torp^o. 

It’s funny. I could imagine that 
torpedo. I could imagine the cold- 
eyed warrior that would aim and 
launch it, and how our ship would 
blossom into a flare of orange light 
and we would all become dis- 
sociated atoms in orbit. Only 
the torpedoman on that ship. I’m 
pretty sure, was at that time an ar- 
morer’s mate named Francy 
Hereiro. We got to be pretty good 
buddies later on. He wasn’t what 
you’d really call a cold-eyed killer. 
I cried in his arms all the day after I 
got back from that last trip, in my 
hospital room, when he was sup- 
posed to be searching me for con- 
traband. And Francy cried with me. 

The cruiser moved away and we 
all surged gently out, then pulled 
ourselves back to the window with 
the grips, as our ship began to close 
in on Gateway. 

“Looks like a case of smallpox,” 
said somebody in the group. 

It did; and some of the 
pockmarks were open. Those were 
the berths for ships that were out on

(Transcript of Q. & A., Professor 
Hegramet's lecture.) 

Q. What did the Heechee look 
like? 

Professor Hegramet: Nobody 
knows. We've never found 
anything resembling a photo- 
graph, or a drawing, except for 
two or three maps. Or a bmk. 

Q. Didn't they have some system 
of storing knowledge, like writ- 
ing? 

Professor Hegramet: Well, of 
course they must have. But 
what it is, I don't know. I have 
a suspicion. .well, if s only a 
guess. 

Q. What? 

Professor Hegramet: Well, think 
about our own storage methods 
and how they would have 
been received in pre- 
technological times. If we'd 
given, say, Euclid a book, he 
could have figured out what it 
was, even if he couldn't under- 
stand what it was saying. But 
what if we'd given him a tape 
cassette? He wouldn't have 



known what to do with it. I 
have a suspicion, no, a convic- 
tion, that we have some 
Heechee "books" we just don't 
recognize. A bar of Heechee 
metal. Maybe that Q-spiral in 
the ships, tne function of which 
we don't know at all. This isn't 
a new idea. They've all been 
tested for magnetic codes, for 
microgrooves, for chemical 
patterns — nothing has shown 
up. But we may not have the 
instrument we need to detect 
the messages. Euclid couldn't 
have tested a tape for magnetic 
information storage without 
something that could detect the 
magnetism — say, a very sensi- 
tive compass ne^le. He didn't 
have an^hing like that. There 
was no way for him to know 
that there was a message on 
the tape. We're in the same 
position with the Heechee. 

Q. There's something about the 
Heechee that I just don't un- 
derstand. Why did they leave 
all these tunnels and places? 
Where did they go? 

Professor Hegramet: Young lady, 
it beats the piss out of me. 



mission. Some of them would stay 
open forever, because the ships 
wouldn’t be coming back. But most 
of the pocks were covered with 
bulges that looked like mushroom 
caps. 

Those caps were the ships them- 
selves, what Gateway was all about. 

The ships weren’t easy to see. 
Neither was Gateway itself It had a 
low albedo to begin with, and it 

18 



wasn’t very big: as I say, about ten 
kilometers on the long axis, half 
that through its equator of rotation. 
But it could have been detected. 
After that first tunnel rat led them 
to it, astronomers began asking each 
other why it hadn’t been spotted a 
century earlier. Now that they know 
where to look, they find it. It some- 
times gets as bright as seventeenth 
magnitude, as seen from Earth. 



GALAXY 






That’s easy. You would have 
thought it would have been picked 
up in a routine mapping program. 

The thing is, there weren’t that 
many routine mapping programs in 
that direction, and it seems Gateway 
wasn’t where they were looking 
when they looked. 

Stellar astronomy usually pointed 
away from the sun. Solar astronomy 
usually stayed in the plane of the 
ecliptic — and Gateway has a right- 
angle orbit. So it fell through the 
cracks. 

The piezophone clucked and said, 
“Docking in five minutes. Return 
to your bunks. Fasten webbing.” 

We were almost there. 

•k -k it 

Sheri Loffat reached out and held 
my hand through the webbing. I 
squeezed back. We had never been 
to bed together, never met until she 
turned up in the bunk next to mine 
on the ship, but the vibrations were 
practically sexual. As though we 
were about to make it in the 
biggest, best way there ever could 
be; but it wasn’t sex, it was Gate- 
way. 

When men began to poke around 
the surface of Venus they found the 
Heechee diggings. 

They didn’t find any Heechees. 
Whoever the Heechees were, 
whenever they had been on Venus, 
they were gone. Not even a body 
was left in a burial pit to exhume 
and cut apart. All there was was the 
tunnels, the caverns, the few pid- 
dling little artifacts, the technological 
Wonders that human beings puzzled 
over and tried to reconstruct. 

Then somebody found a Heechee 
oiap of the solar system. Jupiter 




was there with its moons, and 
Mars, and the outer planets, and the 
Earth-Moon pair. And Venus, 
which was marked in black on the 
shining blue surface of the 
Heechee-metal map. And Mercury, 
and one other thing, the only other 
thing marked in black besides 
Venus: An orbital body that came 
inside the perihelion of Mercury and 
outside the orbit of Venus, tipped 
ninety degrees out of the plane of 
the ecliptic so that it never came 
very close to either. A body which 
had never been identified by terres- 
trial astronomers. Conjecture: an as- 
teroid, or a comet — the difference is 
only semantic — which the Heechee 
had cared about specially for some 
reason. 

Probably sooner or later a tele- 
scopic probe would have followed 
up that clue, but it wasn’t neces- 
sary. Then The Famous Sylvester 
Macklin — who wasn’t up to that 
point the famous anything, just 
another tunnel rat on Venus — found 
a Heechee ship and got himself to 
Gateway, and died there. But he 
managed to let people know where 
he was by cleverly blowing up his 
ship. So a NASA probe was 
diverted from the chromosphere of 
the sun, and Gateway was reached 
and opened up by man. 

Inside were the stars. 

Inside, to be less poetic and more 
literal, were nearly a thousand small- 
ish spacecraft, shaped something 
like fat mushrooms. 'They came in 
several shapes and sizes. The littlest 
ones were button-topped, like the 
mushrooms they grow in the 
Wyoming tunnels after they’ve dug 
all the shale out, and you buy in the 
supermarket. The bigger ones were 

20 



pointy, like morels. Inside the caps 
of the mushrooms were living quar- 
ters and a power source that no one 
understood. The stems were chemi- 
cal rocket ships, kind of like the old 
Moon Landers of the first space 
programs. 

No one had ever figured out how 
the caps were driven, or how to di- 
rect them. 

That was one of the things that 
made us all nervous: the fact that 
we were going to take our chances 
with something nobody understood. 
You literally had no control, once 
you started out in a Heechee ship. 
Their courses were built into their 
midance system, in a way that no- 
body had figured out; you could 
pick a course, but once picked that 
was it — and you didn’t know where 
it was going to take you when you 
picked it, any mote than you know 
what’s in your box of Cracker- Joy 
until you open it. 

But they worked. They still 
worked, after what they say is 
maybe half a million years. 

The first guy who had the guts to 
get into one and try to start it up 
succeeded. It lifted out of its crater 
on the surface of the asteroid. It 
turned fuzzy and bright, and was 
gone. 

And three months later, it was 
back, with a starved, staring as- 
tronaut inside, aglow widi triumph. 
He had been to another star! He had 
orbited a great gray planet with 
swirling yellow clouds, had man- 
aged to reverse the controls — and 
h^ been brought back right to the 
same pockmark, by the built-in guid- 
ance controls. 

So they sent out another ship, 
this time one of the big pointy 

GALAXY 




morel-shaped ones, with a crew of 
four and plenty of rations and in- 
strumentation. They were gone only 
about fifty days. In that time they 
had not only reached another solar 
system, they had actually used the 
lander to go down to the surface of 
a planet. There wasn’t anything liv- 
ing there ... but there had been. 

They found the remnants. Not a 
lot. A few beat-up pieces of trash, 
on a comer of a mountaintop that 
had missed the general destruction 
that had hit the planet. Out of the 
radioactive dust they had picked up 
a brick, a ceramic bolt, a half- 
melted thing that looked as though 
it had once been a chromium flute. 

Then the star rush began . and 
we were part of it. 

V 

Siglrid is a pretty smart machine, 
but sometimes I can’t figure out 
what’s wrong with him. He’s al- 
ways asking me to tell him my 
dreams. Then sometimes I come in 
all aglow with some dream I’m 
positive he’s going to love, a big- 
red-apple-for-the-teacher kind of 
dream, full of penis symbols and 
fetichism and guilt hangups, and he 
disappoints me. He takes off on 
some crazy track that has nothing at 
all to do with it. I tell him the 
whole thing, and then he sits and 
clicks and whirs and buzzes for a 
while — he doesn’t really, but I fan- 
tasy that while I’m waiting — and 
then he says: 

“Let’s go back to something dif- 
ferent, Bob. I’m interested in some 
of the things you’ve said about the 
woman, Gelle-Klara Moynlin.’’ 

I say, “Sigfrid, you’re off on a 

gateway 



wild-goose chase again.’’ 

“I don’t think so. Bob.’’ 

“But that dream! My God, don’t 
you see how important it is? What 
about the mother-figure in it?” 
“What about letting me do my 
job. Bob?” 

“Do I have a choice?” I say, 
feeling sulky. 

“You always have a choice. 
Bob, but I would like very much to 
quote to you something you said a 
while ago.” And he stops, and I 
hear my own voice coming out of 
somewhere in his tapes. I am saying: 
“Sigfrid, there's an intensity of 
pain and guilt and misery there that 
I just can’t handle.” 

He waits for me to say some- 
thing. 

After a moment I do. “That’s a 
nice recording,” I acknowledge, 
“but I’d rather talk about the way 
my mother-fixation comes out in 
my dream.” 

“I think it would be more pro- 
ductive to explore this other matter. 
Bob. It is possible they’re related.” 
“Really?” I am all warmed up to 
discuss this theoretical possibility in 
a detached and philosophical way, 
but he beats me to the punch: 

“The last conversation you had 
with Klara, Bob. Please tell me 
what you feel about it.” 

“I’ve told you.” I am not enjoy- 
ing this at all, it is such a waste of 
time, and I make sure he knows it 
by the tone of my voice and the 
tenseness of my body against the 
restraining straps. “It was even 
worse than with my mother.” 

“I know you’d rather switch to 
talking about your mother, Rob, but 
please don’t, right now. Tell me 
about that time with Klara. What 

21 




are you feeling about it at this min- 
ute?” 

I try to think it out honestly. 
After all, I can do that much. 1 
don’t actually have to say it. But all 
I can find to say is, “Not much.” 
After a little wait he says, “Is 
that all, ‘not much?’ ” 

“That’s it. Not much.” Not 
much on the surface, anyway. I do 
remember how I was feeling at the 
time. I open up that memory, very 
cautiously, to see what it was like. 
Going down into that blue mist. 
Seeing the dim ghost star for the 
first time. Talking to Klara on the 
radio, while Dane is whispering in 
my ear. ... I close it up again. 

“It all hurts, a lot, Sigfrid,” I 
say conversationally. Sometimes I 
try to fool him by saying emotion- 
ally loaded things in the tone you 
might use to order a cup of coffee, 
but I don’t think it works. Sigfrid 
listens to volume and overtones, but 
he also listens to breathing and 
pauses, as well as the sense of the 
words. He is extremely smart, con- 
sidering how stupid he is.

Five permanent- party noncoms, 
one from each of the cruisers, pat- 
ted us down, checked our IDs and 
turned us over to a Corporation 
screening cleric. Sheri giggled when 
the Russian’s pat hit a sensitive spot 
and whispered, “What do they 
think we’re smuggling in. Bob?’ 

I shushed her. The Corporation 
woman had taken our landing cards 
from the Chinese Spec/3 in charge 
of the detail and was calling out our 
names. There were eight of us all 
together. “Welcome aboard,” she 

22 



said. “Each one of you fish will get 
a proctor assigned to you. He’ll 
help you get straightened out with a 
place to live, answer your ques- 
tions, let you know where to report 
for the medical and your classes. 
Also he’ll give you a copy of the 
contract to sign. You’ve each had 
eleven hundred and fifty dollars de- 
ducted from your cash on deposit 
with the ship that brought you here; 
that’s your life-support tax for the 
first ten days. The rest you can 
draw on any time by writing a 
P-check. Your proctor will show 
you how. Linscott!” 

The middle-aged black man from 
Baja California raised his hand. 
“Your proctor is Shota Tarasvili. 
Broadhead!” 

“Here I am.” 

“Dane Metchnikov,” said the 
Corporation clerk. I started to look 
around, but the person who had to 
be Dane Metchnikov was already 
coming toward me. He took my 
arm very firmly, started to lead me 
away and then said, 

“Hi.” 

I held back. “I’d like to say 
good-by to my friend — ” 

“You’re all in the same area,” 
he grunted. “Come on.” 

So within two hours of arriving 
on Gateway I had a room, a proctor 
and a contract. 1 signed the articles 
of agreement right away. I didn’t 
even read them. Metchnikov looked 
surprised. “Don’t you want to 
know what they say?’ ’ 

“Not right this minute.” I mean, 
what was the advantage? If I hadn’t 
liked what they said, I might have 
changed my mind, and what other 
options did I have, really? Being a 
prospector is pretty scary. I hate the

discoveries, artifacts, objects and things of value of any description 1 may find 
during or as a result of exploration involving any craft furnish^ me or information 
given me by the Gateway Authority irrevocably to said Gateway Authority. 

2. I understand that no contract I may have made with any person or group 
relating to any profits or income arising to me from this contract, or in any way 
purporting to affect my actions in regard to any activity undertaken under this

idea of being killed. I hate the idea any more, having everything stop, 
of dying at 5ll, ever; not being alive knowing that all those other people 

gateway 23 



would go on living and having sex 
and joy without me being there to 
share it. But I didn’t hate it as 
much as I hated the idea of going 
back to the food mines. 

Metchnikov hung himself by his 
collar to a hook on the wall of my 
room, to be out of the way while I 
put away my belongings. He was a 
squat, pale man, not very talkative. 
He didn’t seem to be a very likeable 
person, but at least he didn’t laugh 
at me because I was a clumsy new 
fish. Gateway is about as close to 
zero-G as you get. I had never ex- 
perienced low-gravity before, you 
don’t get much of it in Wyoming, 
so I kept misjudging. When I said 
something, Metchnikov said, 
“You’ll get used to it. Have you 
got a toke?’’ 

“Afraid not.’’ 

He sighed, looking a little like 
somebody’s Buddha hung up on the 
wall, with his legs pulled up. 

He looked at his time dial and 
said, “I’ll take you out for a drink 
later. It’s a custom. Only it’s not 
very interesting until about twenty- 
two hundred. The Blue Hell’ll be 
full of people then, and I’ll intro- 
duce you around. See what you can 
find. What are you, straight, gay, 
what?’’ 

“I’m pretty straight.’’ 

“Whatever. You’re on your own 
about that, though. I’ll introduce 
you to whoever I know, but then 
you’re on your own. You better get 
used to that right away. Have you 
got your map?’ ’ 

“Map?’’ 

“Oh, hell, man! It’s in that pack- 
et of stuff they gave you.” 

I opened Ae lockers at random 
until I found where I had put the 

24 



envelope. Inside it were my copy of 
the articles of agreement, a booklet 
that said Welcome to Gateway, my 
room assignment, my health ques- 
tionnaire that I would have to fill 
out before oh eight hundred the next 
morning . and a folded sheet 
that, opened up, looked like a wir- 
ing diagram with names on it. 

“That’s it. Can you locate where 
you are? Remember your room 
number; Level Babe, Quadrant 
East, Tunnel Eight, Room Fifty- 
one. Write it down.” 

“It’s already written here, Dane, 
on my room assignment.” 

“Well, don’t lose it.’’ He 
reached behind his neck and un- 
hooked himself, let himself fall 
gently to the floor. “So why don’t 
you look around by yourself for a 
while. I’ll meet you here. Anything 
else you need to know right now?” 

I thought, while he looked impa- 
tient. “Well — mind if I ask you a 
question about you, Dane? Have 
you been out yet?” 

“Six trips. All right. I’ll see you 
at twenty-two hund^.” He pushed 
the flexible door open, slipped out 
into the jungly green of the corridor 
and was gone. 

I let myself flop — so gently, so 
slowly — into my one real chair and 
tried to make myself understand that 
I was on the doorstep of the uni- 
verse. 

* * * 

I don’t know if I can make you 
feel it, how the universe looked to 
me from Gateway: Like being 
young with Full Medical. Like a 
menu in the best restaurant in the 
world, when somebody else is 

GALAXY 




going to pick up the check. Like a 
girl you’ve just met who likes you. 
Like an unopened gift. 

The things that hit you first on 
Gateway are the tininess of the tun- 
nels, feeling tinier even than they 
are because they’re lined with win- 
dowboxy things of plants; the ver- 
tigo from the low gravity; and the 
stink. You get Gateway a little bit 
at a time. TTiere’s no way of seeing 
it all in one glance, it is nothing but 
a maze of tunnels in the rock. I’m 
not even sure they’ve all been 
explored even yet. Certainly there 
are miles of them that nobody ever 
goes into, or not very often. 

That’s the way the Heechees 
were. They grabbed the asteroid, 
plated it over with wall metal, 
drove tunnels into it, filled them 
with whatever sort of possessions 
they had — most were empty by the 
time we got there, just as every- 
thing that ever belonged to the 
Heechees is, all over the universe. 
And then they left it, for whatever 
reason they left. 

The closest thing to a central 
point in Gateway is Heecheetown. 
That’s a spindle-shaped cave near 
the geometric center of the asteroid. 
They say that when the Heechees 
built Gateway they lived there. We 
lived there too, at first, or close to 
it, all of us new people off Earth. 
(And elsewhere. A ship from Venus 
had come in just before ours.) 
That’s where the company housing 
is. Later on, if we got rich on a 
prospecting trip, we could move out 
farther toward the surface, where 
there was a little more gravity and 
less noise. And above all, less 
smell. A couple thousand people 
had breathed the air I was breath- 

GATEWAY 



WELCOME TO GATEWAY! 

Congratulations! 

You are one of a very few 
people each year who may be- 
come a limited partner in Gate- 
way Enterprises, Inc. Your first 
obligation is to sign the enclosed 
Memorandum of Agreement. You 
need not do this at once. You 
are encouraged to study the 
agreement and to seek legal ad- 
vice, if available. 

However, until you sign you 
will not be eligible to occupy 
Corporation housing, dine at the 
Corporation commissary or par- 
ticipate in the Corporation in- 
struction courses. 

Accommodations are available 
at the Gateway Hotel and Res- 
taurant for those who are here as 
visitors, or who do not at present 
wish to sign the Memorandum of 
Agreement. 



ing, one time or another, voided 
the water I drank and exuded their 
smells into the atmosphere. The 
people didn’t stay around very long, 
most of them. But the smells were 
still there. 

I didn’t care about the smell. I 
didn’t care about any of it. Gateway 
was my big, fat lottery ticket to Full 
Medical, a nine-room house, a 
couple of kids and a lot of joy. I 
had won one lottery already. It made 
me cocky about my chances of 
winning another. 

It was all exciting, although at 
the same time it was dingy enough, 
too. There wasn’t much luxury 
around. For your $238,575 what 
you get is transportation to Gate- 

25 




way, ten days worth of food, lodg- 
ing and air, a cram course in ship 
handling and an invitation to sign 
up on the next ship out. Or any ship 
you like. They don’t make you take 
any particular ship, or for that mat- 
ter any ship at all. 

The Corporation doesn’t make 
any profit on any of that. All the 
prices are fixed alxiut at cost. That 
doesn’t mean they were cheap, and 
it certainly doesn’t mean that what 
you got was good. The food was 
just about what I had been digging, 
and eating, all my life. The lodging 
was about the size of a large 
steamer trunk, one chair, a bunch of 
lockers, a fold-down table and a 
hammock that you could stretch 
across it, corner to comer, when 
you wanted to sleep. 

My next-door neighbors were a 
family from Venus. I caught a 
glimpse through the part-opened 
door. Imagine! Four of them sleep- 
ing in one of those cubicles! It 
looked like two to a hammock, widi 
two hammocks criss-crossed across 
the room. On the other side was 
Sheri’s room. I scratched at her 
door but she didn’t answer. The 
door wasn’t locked. Nobody locks 
his door much on Gateway, because 
there’s nothing much worth stealing 
and for other reasons. Sheri wasn’t 
there. The clothes she had been 
wearing on the ship were thrown all 
over. 

I guessed that she had gone out 
exploring, and wished I had been a 
little earlier; I would have liked 
someone to explore with. I leaned 
against the ivy growing out of one 
wall of the tunnel and pulled out 
my map. 

It did give me some idea of what 

26 



to look for. There were things 
marked “Central Park’’ and “Lake 
Superior.’’ What were they? I won- 
dered about “Gateway Museum,’’ 
which sounded interesting, and 
“Terminal Hospital,’’ which 
sounded pretty bad — I found out 
later that “terminal’’ meant as in 
end of the line, on your return trip 
from wherever you went to. The 
Corporation must have known that 
it had another sound to it, too; but 
the Corporation never was much for 
sparing a prospector’s feelings. 

What I really wanted was to see a 
ship! 

As soon as that thought perco- 
lated out of my mind I realized that 
I wanted it a lot. I puzzled over 
how to get to the outer skin, where 
the ship docks were of course lo- 
cated, holding onto a railing with 
one hand and trying to keep the 
map open with the other. It didn’t 
take me long to locate myself. I 
was at a five-way intersection which 
seemed to be the one marked “East 
Star Babe G’’ on the map. One of 
the five tunnels out of it led to a 
drop shaft, but I couldn’t tell 
which. 

I tried one at random, wound up 
in a dead end and on the way back 
scratched on a door for directions. 
It opened. “Excuse me — ’’ I 
said . and stopped. 

The man who opened the door 
seemed as tall as 1 am, but was not. 
His eyes were on a level with my 
own. But be stopped at the waist. 
He had no legs. 

He said something, but 1 didn’t 
understand it; it wasn’t in English. 
It wouldn’t have mattered. My at- 
tention was taken up with him. He 
wore gauzy bright fabric strapped 

GALAXY] 




from wrists to waist, and he flut- 
tered the wings gently to stay in the 
air. It wasn’t hard, in Gateway’s 
low-G. But it was surprising to see. 
I said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to 
know how to get to Level Tanya.’’ 
I was trying not to stare, but 1 
wasn’t succe^ing. 

He smiled, white teeth in an un- 
lined, old face. He had jet eyes 
under a crest of short white hair. He 
pushed past me out into the corridor 
and said in excellent English, “Cer- 
tainly. Take the first turning on 
your riglit. Go to the next star, and 
take the second turning on your left. 
It’ll be marked.’’ He indicated with 
his chin the way toward the star. 

1 thanked him and left him float- 
ing behind me. I wanted to turn 
back, but it didn’t seem good man- 
ners. It was strange. It hadn’t oc- 
curred to me that there would be 
any cripples on Gateway. 

That’s how naive I was then. 

Having seen him, I knew what I 
had already learned about Gateway 
in a way the statistics I had heard 
had never taught me. The statistics 
are clear enou^, and we all studied 
them, all of us who came up as 
prospectors, and all of that vastly 
larger number who only wished 
they could. About eighty per cent of 
flights from Gateway come up 
empty. About fifteen per cent don’t 
come back at all. So one person in 
twenty, on the average, returns from 
a prospecting trip with something 
that Gateway — that mankind in 
general — can make a profit on. 
Most of even those are lucky if they 
collect enough to pay their costs for 
getting here in the first place. 

And if you get hurt while you’re 
out, well, that’s tough. Terminal 

Gateway 



KEEPING GATEWAY 
GOING 

In order to meet the costs of 
maintaining Gateway, all persons 
are required to pay a daily per- 
capita assessment for air, tem- 
perature control, administration 
and other services. 

If you are a guest, this cost is 
included in your hotel bill. 

Rates for other persons are 
posted. The tax may be prepaid 
up to one year in advance if de- 
sired. Failure to pay the daily 
per-capita tax will result in im- 
mediate expulsion from Gateway. 

Note: Presence of a ship to re- 
ceive expelled persons cannot be 
guaranteed. 



Hospital is about as well equipped 
as any anywhere. But you have to 
get there for it to do you any good. 
You can be months in transit. If 
you get hurt at the other end of 
youf trip — and that’s where it usu- 
ally happens — there’s not much that 
can be done for you until you get 
back to Gateway. By then it can be 
too late to make you whole, and 
likely enough too late to keep you 
alive. 

There’s no charge for a return 
trip to where you came from, by the 
way. The rockets always come up 
fuller than they return. They call it 
wastage. 

The return trip is free ... but to 
what? 

* * * 

I let go the down-cable on Level 
Tanya, turned into a tunnel and ran 
into a man with cap and armband. 

27 




Corporation Police. He didn’t speak 
English, but he pointed and the size 
of him was convincing; I grabbed 
the up-cable, went up one level, 
crossed to another dropshaft and 
tried again. 

The only difference was that this 
time the guard spoke English. “You 
can’t come through here,’’ he said. 
“I just want to see the ships.’’ 
“Sure. You can’t. You’ve got to 
have a blue badge,’’ he said, tap- 
ping his own. “That’s Corporation 
specialist, flight crew or V.I.P.’’ 

“I am flight crew.’’ 

He grinned. “You’re a new fish 
off the Earth transport, aren’t you? 
Friend, you’ll be flight crew when 
you sign on for a flight and not be- 
fore. Go on back up.’’ 

I said reasonably, “You under- 
stand how I feel, don’t you? I just 
want to get a look.’’ 

“You can’t, till you’ve finished 
your course, except they’ll bring 
you down here for part of it. After 
that you’ll see more than you 
want.’’ 

I argued a little more, but he had 
too many arguments on his side. 
But as I reached for the up-cable 
the tunnel seemed to lurch and a 
blast of sound hit my ears. For a 
minute I thought the asteroid was 
blowing up. I stared at the guard, 
who shrugged, not unfiriendlily. “I 
only said you couldn’t see them,’’ 
he said. “I didn’t say you couldn’t 
hear them.” 

I bit back the “wow” or “Holy 
God!” that I really wanted to say, 
and said, “Where do you suppose 
that one’s going?” 

“Come back in six months. 
Maybe we’ll know by then.” 

Well, there was nothing in that to 

28 



feel elated about. All the same, I 
felt elated. After all those years in 
the food mines, here I was, not 
only on Gateway, but right there 
when some of those intrepid pros- 
pectors set out on a trip that would 
bring them fame and incredible for- 
tune! Never mind the odds. This 
was really living on the top line. 

So I wasn’t paying much atten- 
tion to what I was doing, and as a 
result I got lost again on the way 
back. I reached Level Baby ten 
minutes late. 

Dane Metchnikov was striding 
down the tunnel away from my 
room. He didn’t appear to recognize 
me. 1 think he might have passed 
me if I hadn’t put out my arm. 

“Huh,” he grunted. “You’re 
late.” 

“I was down on Level Tanya, 
trying to get a look at the ships.” 

“Huh. You can’t go down there 
unless you have a blue badge or a 
bangle.” 

Well, I had found that out al- 
ready, hadn’t I? So I tagged along 
after him, without wasting energy 
on attempts at further conversation. 

Metchnikov was a pale man, ex- 
cept for the marvelously ornate 
curled whisker that followed the 
line of his jaw. It seemed to be 
waxed, so that each separate curl 
stood out with a life of its own. 
“Waxed” was wrong. It had some- 
thing in it besides hair, but what- 
ever it was wasn’t stiff. The whole 
thing moved as he moved, and 
when he talked or smiled the mus- 
cles moored to the jawbone made 
the beard ripple and flow. He fi- 
nally did smile, after we got to the 
Blue Hell. He bought the first 
drink, explaining carefully that that 

GALAXY 




was the custom, but that the custom 
only called for one. I bought the 
second. The smile came when, out 
of turn, I also bought the third. 

Over the noise in the Blue Hell 
talk wasn’t easy, but I told him 
about hearing a launch. “Right,” 
he said, lifting his glass. “Hope 
they have a good trip.” He wore 
six blue-glowing Heechee metal 
bracelets, hardly thicker than wire. 
They tinkled faintly as he swal- 
lowed half the drink. 

“Are they what I think they 
are?” I asked. “One for every trip 
out?” 

He drank the other half of the 
drink. “That’s right. Now I’m 
going to dance,” He said. I looked 
after his back as he lunged toward a 
woman in a luminous pink sari. He 
wasn’t much of a talker, that was 
sure. 

On the other hand, in that noise 
level you couldn’t talk much any- 
how. You couldn’t really dance 
much, either. The Blue Hell was up 
in the center of Gateway, part of 
the spindle-shaped cave. Rotational 
G was so low that we didn’t weigh 
more than two or three pounds; if 
anyone had tried to waltz or polka 
he would have gone flying. So they 
did those no-touching junior-high- 
school sort of dances that appear to 
be designed so fourteen-year-old 
boys won’t have to look up at too 
sharp an angle to the fourteen- 
year-old girls they’re dancing with. 
You pretty much kept your feet in 
place, and your head and arms and 
shoulders and hips went where they 
Wanted to. Me, I like to touch. But 
you can’t have everything. I like to 
dance anyway. 

I saw Sheri, way across the 

gateway 



WHAT IS GATEWAY? 

Gateway is an artifact created by 
the so-called Heechee. It appears 
to have been formed around an as- 
teroid, or the core of an atypical 
comet. The time of this event is not 
known, but almost surely precedes 
the rise of human civilization. 

Inside Gateway the environment 
resembles Earth, except that there 
is relatively little gravity. (Actually 
there is virtually none, but cen- 
trifugal force derived from Gate- 
way's rotation gives a similar ef- 
fect.) If you have come from Earth 
you will notice some difficulty in 
breathing for the first few days be- 
cause of the low atmospheric 
pressure. However, the partial 
pressure of oxygen is identical with 
the 2000-meter elevation at Earth 
and is fully adequate for all persons 
in normal health. 



room, with an older woman I took 
to be her proctor, and danced one 
with her. “How do you like it so 
far?” I shouted over the tapes. She 
nodded and shouted something back, 
I couldn’t say what. I danced with 
an immense black woman who wore 
two blue bracelets, then with Sheri 
again, then with a girl Dane Metch- 
nikov dropped on me, apparently 
because he wanted to be rid of her, 
then with a tall, strong-faced 
woman with the blackest, thickest 
eyebrows I had ever seen under a 
female hairdo. (She wore it pulled 
back in two pigtails that floated 
around behind her as she moved.) 
She wore a couple of bracelets, too. 
And between dances I drank. 

They had tables that were meant

SYLVESTER MACKLEN: 
FATHER OF GATEWAY 

Gateway was discovered by 
Sylvester Macklen, a tunnel 
explorer on Venus, who found an 
operable Heechee spacecraft in 
a dig. He succeeded in getting it 
to the surface and bringing it to 
Gateway, where it now rests in 
Dock 5-33. Tragically, Macklen 
was not able to return and, al- 
though he succeeded in signal- 
ling his presence by exploding 
the fuel tank of the lander of his 
ship, he was dead before inves- 
tigators reached Gateway. 

Macklen was a courageous 
and resourceful man, and the 
plaque at Dock 5-33 commemo- 
rates his unique service to hu- 
manity. Services are held at ap- 
propriate times by repre- 
sentatives of the various faiths. 



for parties of eight or ten, but there 
weren’t any parties of eight or ten. 
People sat where they wanted to, 
and took each other’s seats without 
worrying about whether the owner 
was coming back. For a while there 
were half a dozen crewmen in 
Brazilian navy dress whites sitting 
with me, talking to each other in 
Portuguese. A man with one golden 
earring joined me for a while, but I 
couldn’t understand what he was 
saying, either. (I did, pretty well, 
understand what he meant.) 

There was that trouble all the 
time I was in Gateway. There al- 
ways is. Gateway sounds like an in- 
ternational conference when the 
translation has broken down. 
There’s a sort of lingua franca you 

30 



hear a lot, pieces of a dozen differ- 
ent languages thrown together, like, 
“Ecoutez, gospodin, tu es ver- 
ruckt.” I danced twice with one of 
the Brazilians, a skinny, dark little 
girl with a hawk nose but sweet 
brown eyes, and tried to say a few 
simple words. Maybe she under- 
stood me. One of the men she was 
with, though, spoke fine English, 
introduced himself and the others all 
around. I didn’t catch any of the 
names but his, Francesco Hereira. 
He bought me a drink, and let me 
buy one for the crowd, and then I 
realized I’d seen him before: He 
was one of the detail that searched 
us on the way in. 

While we were commenting on 
that, Dane leaned over me and 
grunted in my ear, “I’m going to 
gamble. So long, unless you really 
want to come.’’ 

It wasn’t the warmest invitation 
I’d ever had, but the noise in the 
Blue Hell was getting heavy. I 
tagged after him and discovert a 
whole full-scale casino just next to 
the Blue Hell, with blackjack ta- 
bles, poker, a sort of slow-motion 
roulette with a big, dense ball, 
craps with dice that took forever to 
stop, even a roped off section for 
baccarat. Metchnikov headed for the 
blackjack tables and drummed his 
fingers on the back of a player’s 
chair, waiting for an opening. 
Around then he noticed I h^ come 
with him. 

“Oh.” He looked around the 
room. “What do you like to play?” 

“I’ve played it all,” I said, slur- 
ring the words a little. Bragging a 
little, too. “Maybe a little bac- 
carat.” 

He looked at me first with re- 

GALAXY 




spect, then amusement. “Fifty’s the 
minimum bet.’’ 

I had live or six thousand dollars 
left in my account. I shrugged. 

“That’s fifty thousand,’’ he said. 

I choked. He said absently, mov- 
ing over behind a player whose chip 
stack was running out, “You can 
get down for ten dollars at roulette. 
Hundred minimum for most of the 
others. Oh, there’s a ten-dollar slot 
machine around somewhere, I 
think.” He dived for the open chair 
and that was the last I saw of him. 

I watched for a moment, and 
realized that the black-eyebrowed 
girl was at the same table, busy 
studying her cards. She didn’t look 
up. 

I could see I wasn’t going to be 
able to afford much gambling here. 
At that point I realized I couldn’t 
really afford all the drinks I’d been 
buying, either, and then my interior 
sensory system began to make me 
realize just how many of those 
drinks I had had. The last thing I 
realized was that I had to get back 
to my room, pretty fast. 

VII 

I am on the mat, and I am not 
very comfortable. Physically, I 
mean. I have had an operation not 
long ago and probably the stitches 
aren’t yet absorbed. 

Sigfrid says, “We were talking 
about your job. Bob.” 

That’s dull enough. But safe 
enough. I say, “I hated my job. 
^ho wouldn’t hate the food 
mines?’ ’ 

‘‘But you kept it. Bob. You 
never even tried to get on anywhere 
®lse. You could have switched to 

Gateway 



sea-farming, maybe. And you 
dropped out of school.” 

“You’re saying I stuck myself in 
a rut?” 

“I’m not saying anything. Bob. 
I’m asking you what you feel.” 
“Well. I guess in a sense I did 
do that. I thought about making 
some kind of a change. I thought 
about it a lot,” 1 say, remembering 
how it was in those bright early 
days with Sylvia. I remember sitting 
with her in the cockpit of a parked 
sailplane on a January night — we 
had IK) other place to go — and talk- 
ing about the future. What we 
would do. How we would beat the 
odds. There’s nothing there for Sig- 
frid, as far as 1 can see. I’ve told 
Sigffid all about Sylvia, who mar- 
ri^ a stockholder in the long run. 
But we’d broken up long before 
that. “I suppose,” I say, pulling 
myself up short and trying to get 
my money’s worth out of this ses- 
sion, “that I had a kind of death 
wish.” 

“I prefer that you don’t use 
psychiatric terms. Bob.” 

“Well, you understand what I 
mean. I knew time was going by. 
The longer I stayed in the mines the 
harder it would be to get out. But 
nothing else looked any better. And 
there were compensations. My 
girlfriend, Sylvia. My mother, 
while she was alive. Friends. Even 
some fun things. Sailplaning. It is 
great over the hills, and when 
you’re up high enough Wyoming 
doesn’t look so bad and you can 
hardly smell the oil.” 

“You mentioned your girl friend, 
Sylvia. Did you get along with 
her?” 

I hesitated, rubbing at my belly. I 

31 




have almost half a meter of new in- 
testine in there now. They cost fear- 
fully, those things, and sometimes 
you get the feeling the previous 
owner wants them back. You won- 
der who he was. Or she. How he 
died. Or did he die? Could he still 
be alive, so poor that he sells off 
parts of himself, the way I’ve heard 
of pretty girls doing with a well- 
shaped breast or ear? 

“EHd you make friends with girls 
easily. Bob?” 

‘T do now, all right.” 

“Not now. Bob. 1 think you said 
you didn’t make friends easily as a 
child.” 

“Does anyone?” 

“If I understand that question, 
Robbie, you are asking if anyone 
remembers childhood as a perfectly 
happy and easy experience, and of 
course the answer is ‘no.’ But some 
people seem to carry the effects of 
it over into their lives more than 
others.” 

“Yeah. I guess, thinking back, 
that I was a little afraid of my peer 
group — (Sorry about that, Sigfrid! I 
mean the other kids.)They all 



seemed to know each other. They 
had things to say to each other all 
the time. Secrets. Shared experi- 
ences. Interests. I was a loner.” 

“You were an only child, Rob- 
bie?” 

“You know I was. Yeah. Maybe 
that was it. Both my parents 
worked. And they didn’t like me* 
playing near the mines. Dangerous. 
Well, it really was dangerous for 
kids. You can get hurt around those 
machines, or even if there’s a slide 
in the tailings or an outgassing. 1 
stayed at home a lot, watching 
shows, playing cassettes. Eating. I 
was a fat kid, Sigfrid. I loved all 
the starchy, sugary stuff with all the 
calories. They spoiled me, buying 
me more food than I needed.” 

I still like to be spoiled. Now 1 
get a higher class of diet, not as fat- 
tening, about a thousand times as 
expensive. I’ve had real caviar. Of- 
ten. It gets flown in from the 
aquarium at Galveston. I have real 
champagne, and butter. ... “I 
remember lying in bed,” 1 
say — “1 guess 1 was very small, 
maybe about three. I had a teddy-

talker. 1 took it to bed with me, and 
it told me little stories, and I stuck 
pencils into it and tried to pull its 
ears off. I loved that thing, Sig- 
ffid.” 

I stop, and Sigirid picks up im- 
mediately. “Why are you crying, 
Robbie?” 

“I don’t know!” I bawl, tears 
running down my face, and I look 
at my watch, the skipping green 
numerals rippling through the tears. 
“Oh,” I say, and sit up, very con- 
versationally, the tears still rolling 
down my face but the fountain 
turned off, “I’ve really got to go 
now, Sigfrid. I’ve got a date. Her 
name’s Tania. Beautiful girl. The 
Houston Symphony. She loves 
Mendelssohn and roses, and I want 
to see if I can pick up some of 
those dark-blue hybrids that will go 
with her eyes.” 

“Rob, we’ve got nearly ten min- 
utes left.” 

“I’ll make it up another time.” I 
know he can’t do that, so I add 
quickly, “May I use your bath- 
room? I need to.” 

“Are you going to excrete your 
feelings, Rob?” 

“Oh, don’t be smart. I know 
what you’re saying. I know this 
looks like a typical displacement 
mechanism — ” 

“Rob.” 

“ — all right, I mean, it looks like 
I’m copping out. But I honestly do 
have to go. To the bathroom, I 
mean. And to the florist’s, too. 
Tani is pretty special. She’s a fine 
person. I’m not talking about sex, 
but that’s great too. She can g — 
She can — ” 

“What are you trying to say?” 

I take a breath and manage to 

Gateway 



say: “She’s great at oral sex, Sig- 
frid.” 

“Rob?” 

I recognize that tone. Sigfrid’s 
repertory of vocal modes is quite 
large, but parts of it I have learned 
to identify. He thinks he is on the 
track of something. 

“What?” 

“Bob, what do you call it when a 
woman gives you oral sex?” 

“Oh, Christ, Sigfrid, what kind 
of dumb game is this one?” 

“What do you call it. Bob?” 

“Ah! You know as well as I.” 
“Please tell me what you call it.” 
“They say, like, “She eats 
me.’ ” 

“What other expression. Bob?” 
“Lots of them! ‘Giving head,’ 
that’s one. I guess I’ve heard a 
thousand terms for it.” 

“What other. Bob?” 

I have been building up to rage 
and pain and it suddenly boils over. 
“Don’t play these fucking games 
with me, Sigfrid!” My gut aches, 
and I am afraid I am going to mess 
my pants, it is like being a baby 
again. “Jesus, Sigfrid! When I was 
a little kid I used to talk to my 
teddy. Now I’m forty-five and I’m 
still talking to a stupid machine as 
if it was alive!” 

“But there is another term, isn’t 
there. Bob?” 

“There are thousands of them! 
Which one do you want?’ ’ 

“I want the expression you were 
going to use and didn’t. Bob. 
Please try to say it. That term 
means something special to you, so 
much so that you can’t say the 
words without trouble.” 

I crumple over onto the mat, and 
now I’m really crying.

WHO OWNS GATEWAY? 

Gateway is unique in the his- 
tory of humanity, and it was 
quickly realized that it was too 
valuable a resource to be given 
to any one group of persons, or 
any one government.' Therefore 
Gateway Enterprises, Inc. was 
formed. 

Gateway Enterprises (usually 
referred to as “the Corporation") 
is a multinational corporation 
whose general partners are the 
governments of The United 
States of America, The Soviet 
Union, The United States of 
Breizil, The Venusian Confedera- 
tion and New People’s Asia, and 
whose limited partners are all 
those persons who, like yourself, 
have signed the attached 
Memorandum of Agreement. 



“Please say it, Bob. What’s the 
term?’’ 

“Damn you, Sigfrid! Going 
down! That’s it. Going down, going 
down, going down!” 

VIII 

“Good morning,” said some- 
body, speaking right into the middle 
of a dream about getting stuck in a 
sort of quicksand in the middle of 
the Orion Nebula. “I have brought 
you some tea.” 

I opened an eye. I looked over 
the edge of the hammock into a 
nearby pair of coalsack-black eyes 
set into a sand-colored face. I was 
fully dressed and hung over; some- 
thing smelled very bad, and I 
realized it was me. 

“My name,” said the person 

34 



with the tea, “is Shikitei Bakin. 
Please drink this tea. It will help 
rehydrate your tissues.” 

I looked a little further and saw 
that he ended at the waist; he was 
the legless man with the strap-on 
wings whom L had seen in the tun- 
nel the day before. “Uh,” 1 said, 
and tried a little harder and got as 
far as, “Good morning.” The 
Orion Nebula was fading back into 
the dream, and so was the sensation 
of having to push through rapidly 
solidifying gas clouds. The bad 
smell remained. The room smelled 
excessively foul, even by Gateway 
standards, and I realized I had 
thrown up on the floor. I was only 
millimeters from doing it again. 
Bakin, slowly stroking the air with 
his wings, dexterously dropped a 
stoppered flask next to me on the 
hammock at the end of one stroke. 
Then he propelled himself to the top 
of my chest of drawers, sat and said: 
“I believe you have a medical 
examination this morning at oh 
eight hundred hours.” 

“Do I?” I managed to get the 
cap off the tea and took a sip. It 
was very hot, sugarless and almost 
tasteless, but it did seem to tip the 
scales inside my gut in the direction 
opposite to throwing up. 

“Yes. I think so. It’s customary. 
And in addition, your P-phone has 
rung several times.” 

I went back to, “Uh?” 

“I presume it was your proctor 
calling you to remind you. It is now 
seven-fifteen, Mr. — ” 

“Broadhead,” I said thickly, and 
then more carefully: “My name is 
Bob Broadhead.” 

“Yes. I took the liberty of mak- 
ing sure you were awake. Please 

GALAXY 




enjoy your tea, Mr. Broadhead. 
Enjoy your stay on Gateway.” 

He nodded, fell forward off the 
chest, swooped toward the door, 
handed himself through it and was 
gone. With my head thudding at 
every change of attitude I got my- 
self out of the hammock, trying to 
avoid the nastier spots on the floor, 
and somehow succeeded in getting 
reasonably clean. I thought of de- 
pilating, but I had about twelve 
days on a beard and decided to let it 
go for a while; it no longer looked 
unshaven, exactly. 

When I wobbled into the medical 
examining room I was only aboitt 
five minutes late. The others in my 
group were all ahead of me, so I 
had to wait and go last. They extract- 
ed three kinds of blood from me, 
fingertip, inside of the elbow and 
lobe of the ear; I was sure they 
would all run ninety proof. But it 
didn’t matter. The medical was only 
a formality. If you could survive the 
trip up to Gateway by spacecraft in 
the first place you could survive a 
trip in a Heechee ship. Unless 
something went wrong. In which 
case you probably couldn’t survive 
anyway, no matter how healthy you 
were. 

it it * 

I had time for a quick cup of cof- 
fee off a cart that someone was 
tending next to a dropshaft (private 
enterprise on Gateway? I hadn’t 
known that existed), and then I got 
to the first session of the class right 
on the tick. We met in a big room 
on Level Dog, long and narrow and 
low-ceilinged. The seats were ar- 
ranged two on each side with a 
center aisle, sort of like a school- 

GATEWAY 



room in a converted bus. Sheri 
came in late, looking fresh and 
cheerful, and slipped in beside me; 
our whole group was there, all 
seven of us who had come up from 
Earth together, the family of four 
from Venus and a couple others I 
knew to be new fish like me. “You 
don’t look too bad,” Sheri whis- 
pered as the instructor pondered 
over some papers on his desk. 

“Does the hangover show?” 

“Actually not. But I assume it’s 
there. I heard you coming in last 
night. In fact,” she added thought- 
fully, “the whole tunnel heard 
you.” 

I winced. I could still smell my- 
self, but most of it was apparently 
inside me. None of the others 
seemed to be edging away, not even 
Sheri. 

The instructor stood up and 
studied us thoughtfully for a while. 
“Oh, well,” he said, and looked at 
his paper. Then he shook his head. 
“I won’t take attendance,” he said. 
“My name’s Rocco Riccieri, and I 
teach the course in how to run a 
Heechee ship.” I noticed he had a 
batch of bracelets; I couldn’t count 
them, but there were at least half a 
dozen. I wondered briefly about 
these people I kept seeing who had 
been out a lot of times and still 
weren’t rich. “This is only one of the 
three courses you get. After this 
you get survival in unfamiliar envi- 
ronments, and then how to recog- 
nize what’s valuable. But this one is 
in ship-handling, and the way we’re 
going to start learning it is by doing 
it. All of you come with me.” 

So we all got up and gaggled 
after him, out of the room, down a 
tunnel, onto the down-cable of a 

35 





dropshaft and past the guards — 
maybe the same ones who had 
chased me away the night before. 
This time they just nodded to Riccieri 
and watched us go past. We wound 
up in a long, wide, low-ceilinged 
passage with about a dozen 
squared-off and stained metal cylin- 
ders sticking up out of the floor. 
They looked like charred tree- 
stumps, and it was a moment before 
I realized what they were. 

I gulped. 

“They’re ships,” I whispered to 
Sheri, louder than I intended. A 
couple of people looked at me curi- 
ously. One of them, I noticed, was 
a girl I had danced with the night 
before, the one with the dense black 
eyebrows. She nodded to me and 
smiled; I saw the bangles on her 
arm, and wondered what she was 
doing there — and how she had done 
at the gambling tables. 

The instructor gathered us around 
him and said, “As someone just 
said, these are Heechee ships. The 

36 



lander part. This is the piece you go 
down to a planet in, if you’re lucky 
enough to find a planet. They don’t 
look very big, but five people can 
fit into each of those garbage cans 
you see. Not comfortably, exactly. 
But they can. Generally speaking, 
of course, you’ll always leave one 
person in the main ship, so there’ll 
be at most four in the lander.’’ 

He led us past the nearest of 
them, and we all satisfied the im- 
pulse to touch, scratch or pat it. 
Then he began to lecture: 

“There were nine hundred and 
twenty-four of these ships docked at 
Gateway when it was first explored. 
About two hundred, so far, have 
proved non-operational. Mostly we 
don’t know why; they just don’t 
work. Three hundred and four have 
actually been sent out on at least 
one trip. Thirty-three of those are 
here now, and available for pros- 
pecting trips. The others haven’t 
been tried yet.’’ He hiked himself 
up on the stumpy cylinder and sat 

GALAXY 




there while he went on: 

“One thing you have to decide is 
whether you want to take one of the 
thirty-three tested ones or one of the 
ones that has never been flown. By 
human beings, I mean. There you 
just pay your money and take your 
choice. It’s a gamble either way. A 
high proportion of the trips that 
didn’t come back were in first 
flights, so there’s obviously some 
risk there. Well, that figures, 
doesn’t it? After all, nobody has 
done any maintenance on them for 
God knows how long, since the 
Heechee put them there. 

“On the other hand, there’s a 
risk in the ones that have been out 
and back safely, too. There’s no 
such thing as perpetual motion. We 
think some of the no-retums have 
been because the ships ran out of 
fuel. Trouble is, we don’t know what 
the fuel is, or how much there is, or 
how to tell when a ship is about to run 
out.’’ 

He patted the stump. “This, and 
all the others you see here, were 
designed to hold five Heechee. As 
far as we can tell. But we send 
them out with three human beings. 
It seems the Heechee were more tol- 
erant of each other’s company in 
confined spaces than people are. 
There are bigger and smaller ships, 
but the no-retum rate on them has 
been very bad the last couple of or- 
bits. It’s probably just a string of 
bad luck, but — Anyway, I person- 
ally would stick with a Three. You 
people, you do what you want. 

‘‘So you come to your second 
^oice, which is who you go with. 
Keep your eyes open — What?’’ 
Sheri said, “How bad is very 
bad?’’ 

Gateway 



The instructor said patiently, “In 
the last fiscal orbit about thi^ out 
of ten Fives came back. Those are 
the biggest ships. In several cases 
the crews were dead when we got 
them open, even so.’’ 

“Yeah,” said Sheri, “that’s bad.” 
“No, that’s not bad at all, com- 
pared to the one-man ships. Two 
orbits ago we went a whole orbit 
and only two Ones came back at 
all. That’s bad.” 

“Why is that?” asked the father 
of the tunnel-rat family. Their name 
was Forehand. The instructor 
looked at him for a moment. 

“If you ever find out,” he said, 
“be sure and tell some- 
body. Now. As far as selecting 
a crew is concerned, you’re better 
off if you can get somebody who’s 
already been out. Maybe you can, 
maybe you can’t. Prospectors who 
strike it rich generally quit; the ones 
that are still hungry may not want 
to break up their teams. So a lot of 
you fish are going to have to go out 
with other virgins. Um.” He looked 
around thoughtfully. “Well, let’s 
get our feet wet. Sort yourselves out 
into groups of three-^on’t worry 
about who’s in your group, this 
isn’t where you pick your 
partners — and climb into one of 
those open landers. Don’t touch 
anything. They’re supposed to be in 
deactive mode, but I have to tell 
you they don’t always stay deactive. 
Just go in, climb down to the con- 
trol cabin and wait for an instructor. ’ ’ 
That was the first I’d heard that 
there were other instructors. I 
looked around, trying to work out 
which were teachers and which 
were fish, while he said, “Are there 
any questions?” 

37 




WHAT DOES THE 
CORPORATION DO? 

The purpose of the Corpora- 
tion is to exploit the spacecraft 
left by the Heechee, and to trade 
in, develop or otherwise utilize all 
artifacts, goods, raw materials or 
other things of value discovered 
by means of these vessels. 

The Corporation encourages 
commercial development of 
Heechee technology, and grants 
leases on a royalty basis for this 
purpose. 

Its revenues are used to pay 
appropriate shares to limited 
partners, such as you, who have 
been instrumental in discovering 
new things of value; to pay the 
costs of maintaining Gateway it- 
self over and above the per- 
capita tax contribution; to pay to 
each of the general partners an 
annual sum sufficient to cover 
the cost of maintaining surveil- 
lance by means of the space 
cruisers you will have observed 
in orbit nearby; to create and 
maintain an adequate reserve for 
contingencies; and to use the 
balance of its income to sub- 
sidize research and development 
on the objects of value them- 
selves. 

In the fiscal year ending Feb- 
ruary 30th last, the total rev- 
enues of the Corporation ex- 
ceeded 3.7 X 10^2 dollars U.S. 



Sheri again. “Yeah. What’s your 
name?” 

“Did I forget that again? I’m 
Jimmy Chou. Pleased to meet you 
all. Now let’s go.” 

38 



Now I know a lot more than my 
instructor did, including what hap- 
pened to him half an orbit later — 
poor old Jimmy Chou, he went out 
before I did, and came back while 1 
was on my second trip, very dead. 
Flare bums, they say his eyes were 
boiled out of his head. But at that 
time he knew it all, and it was all 
very strange and wonderful to me. 

So we crawled into the funny el- 
liptical hatch that let you slip be- 
tween the thrusters and down into 
the landing capsule, and then down 
a peg-ladder one step further into 
the main vehicle itself. 

We looked around, three Ali 
Babas staring at the treasure cave. 
We heard a scratching above us, 
and a head poked in. It had shaggy 
eyebrows and pretty eyes, and it be- 
longed to the girl I had been danc- 
ing with the night before. “Haying 
fun?” she inquired. We were cling- 
ing together as far from anything 
that looked moveable as we could 
get, and I doubt we really looked at 
ease. “Never mind,” she said, 
“just look around, get familiar with 
it. You’ll see a lot of it. That verti- 
cal line of wheels with the little 
spokes sticking out of them? That’s 
the target selector. That’s the most 
important thing not to touch for 
now — maybe ever. That golden spi- 
ral thing over next to you there, the 
blonde girl? Anybody want to guess 
what that’s for?” 

You-there-blonde-girl, who was 
one of the Forehand daughters, 
shrank away from it and shook her 
head. I shook mine, but Sheri 
hazarded, ‘ ‘Could it be a hatrack?’ ’ 

Teacher squinted at it thought- 
fully. “Hmm. No, 1 don’t think so, 
but I keep hoping one of you fish 

GALAXY 




will know the answer. None of us 
here do. It gets hot sometimes in 
flight; nobody knows why. The 
toilet’s in there. You’re going to 
have a lot of fun with that. But it 
does work, after you learn how. 
You can sling your hammocks and 
sleep there — or anywhere you want 
to, actually. That comer, and that 
recess are fairly dead space. If 
you’re in a crew that wants some 
privacy, you can screen them off. A 
little bit, anyway.” 

Sheri said, ‘‘Don’t any of you 
people like to tell your names?” 

Teacher grinned. ‘‘I’m Gelle- 
Klara Moynlin. You want to know 
the rest about me? I’ve been out 
twice and didn’t score, and I’m kill- 
ing time until the right trip comes 
along. So I work as assistant in- 
structor.” 

‘‘How do you know which is the 
right trip?” asked the Forehand girl. 

‘‘Bright fellow, you. Good ques- 
tion. That’s another of those ques- 
tions that I like to hear you ask, be- 
cause it shows you’re linking, but 
if there’s an answer I dpn’t know 
what it is. Let’s see. You already 
know this ship is a Three. It’s done 
six round trips already, but it’s a 
reasonable bet that it’s got enough 
reserve fuel for a couple more. I’d 
rather take it than a One. That’s for 
long-shot gamblers. ” 

‘‘Mr. Qiou said that,” said the 
Forehand girl, ‘‘but my father says 
he’s been all through the records 
since Orbit One and the Ones aren’t 
that bad.” 

‘‘Your father can have mine,” 
said Gelle-Klara Moynlin. ‘‘It’s not 
Just statistics. Ones are lonesome. 
Anyway, one person can’t really 
handle everything if you hit lucky,

orbit — most of us keep one man in 
the ship, feels safer that way; at 
least somebody might get help if 
things go rancid. So two of you go 
down in the lander to look around. 
Of course, if you do hit lucky you 
have to split it three ways. If you 
hit anything big, there’s plenty to 
go around. And if you don’t hit, 
one-third of nothing is no less than 
all of it.” 

‘‘Wouldn’t it be even better in a 
Five, then?” I asked. 

Klara looked at me and half- 
winked; I hadn’t thought she re- 
membered dancing the night before. 
‘‘Maybe, maybe not. The thing 
about Fives is that they have almost 
unlimited target acceptance.” 

‘‘Please talk English,” Sheri 
coaxed. 

‘‘Fives will accept a lot of desti- 
nations that Threes and Ones won’t. 
I think it’s because some of those 
destinations are dangerous. The 
worst ship I ever saw come back 
was a Five. All scarred and seared 
and bent; nobody knows how it 
made it back at all. Nobody knows 
where it had been, either, but I 
heard somebody say it might’ve ac- 
tually been in the photosphere of a 
star. The crew couldn’t tell us. 
They were dead. 

‘‘Of course,” she went on 
meditatively, ‘‘an armored Three 
has almost as much target accep- 
tance as a Five, but you take your 
chances any way you swing. Now 
let’s get with it, shall we? You — ” 
she pointed at Sheri — ” sit down 
over there.” 

The Forehand girl and I crawled 
around the mix of human and 
Heechee furnishing to make room.

GATEWAY’S SHIPS 

The vessels available on 
Gateway are capable of interstel- 
lar flight at speeds greater than 
the velocity of light. The means 
of propulsion is not understood 
(see pilot manual.) There is also 
a fairly conventional rocket- 
propulsion system, using liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen, for 
attitude control, and for propul- 
sion of the landing craft that is 
docked into each interstellar ves- 
sel. 

There are three major classifi- 
cations, designated as Class 1, 
Class 3 and Class 5, according 
to the number of persons they 
can carry. Some of the vessels 
are of particularly heavy con- 
struction and are designated 
“armored.” Most of the armored 
class are Fives. 

Each vessel is programmed to 
navigate itself automatically to a 
number of destinations. Return is 
automatic, and is quite reliable in 
practice. Your course in ship 
handling will adequately prepare 
you for all the necessary tasks in 
piloting your vessel safely; how- 
ever, see pilot manual for safety 
regulations. 



There wasn’t much. If you cleared 
everything out of a Three you’d 
have a room about four meters by 
three by three, but of course if you 
cleared everything out it wouldn’t 

go. 

Sheri sat down in front of the col- 
umn of spoked wheels, wriggling 
her bottom to try to get a fit. 

40 



“What kind of behinds did the 
Heechee have?’’ she complained. 

Teacher said, “Another good 
question, same no-good answer. If 
you find out, tell us. The Corpora- 
tion puts that webbing in the seat. It 
isn’t original equipment. Okay. 
Now, that thing you’re looking at is 
the target selector. Put your hand on 
one of the wheels. Any one. Just 
don’t touch any other. Now move 
it.’’ She peered down anxiously as 
Sheri touched the bottom wheel, 
then thrust with her fingers, then 
laid the heel of her hand on it, 
braced herself against the V-shaped 
arms of the seat and shoved. Finally 
it moved, and the lights along the 
row of wheels began to flicker. 

“Wow,” said Sheri, “they 
must’ve been pretty strong!” 

We took turns trying with that 
one wheel — Klara wouldn’t let us 
touch any other that day — and when 
it came my turn I was surprised to 
find that it took about as much 
muscle as I could bring to bear to 
make it move. It didn’t feel rusted 
stuck, it felt as though it were 
meant to be hard to turn. And, 
when you think how much trouble 
you can get into if you turn a set- 
ting by accident in the middle of a 
flight, it probably was. 

# * * 

Of course, now I know more 
about that, too, than my teacher did 
then. Not that I’m so smart, but it 
has taken, and is still taking, a lot 
of people a hell of a long time to 
figure out what goes on just in set- 
ting up a target on the course direc- 
tor. 

What it is is a vertical row of 
number generators. The lights that 

GALAXY 




show up display numbers; that’s not 
easy to see, because they don’t look 
like numbers. They aren’t posi- 
tional, or decimal. (Apparently the 
Heechee expressed numbers as sums 
of primes and exponents, but all 
that’s way over my head.) Only the 
check-pilots and the course- 
programmers working for the Cor- 
poration really have to be able to 
read the numbers, and they don’t do 
it directly, only with a computing 
translator. The first five digits ap- 
pear to express the position of the 
target in space, reading from bottom 
to top. (Dane Metchnikov says the 
prime ordering isn’t from bottom to 
top but from front to back, which 
says something or other about the 
Heechee. They were three-D 
oriented, like primitive man, instead 
of two-D oriented, like us.) You 
would think that three numbers 
would be enough to describe any 
position anywhere in the universe, 
wouldn’t you? I mean, if you make 
a three-dimensional representation 
of the Galaxy you can express any 
point in it by means of a number 
for each of the three dimensions. 
But it took the Heechee five. Does 
that mean there were five dimen- 
sions that were perceptible to the 
Heechee? Metchnikov says 
not. 

Anyway. Once you get a lock on 
the first five numbers, the other 
seven can be turned to quite arbi- 
trary settings and you’ll still go 
when you squeeze the action teat. 

What you usually do — or what 
the course-programmers the Corpo- 
ration keeps on the payroll to do 
this sort of thing for you usually 
“0— is pick four numbers at ran- 
dom. Then you cycle the fifth digit 

'Gateway 



until you get a kind of warning pink 
glow. Sometimes it’s faint, some- 
times it’s bright. If you stop there 
and press the flat oval part under 
the teat, the other numbers begin to 
creep around, just a couple of mil- 
limeters one way or another, and 
the pink glow gets brighter. When 
they stop it’s shocking pink and 
shockingly bright. Metchnikov says 
that’s an automatic fine-tuning de- 
vice. The machine allows for 
human error — sorry, I mean for 
Heechee error— so when you get 
close to a real, valid target setting it 
makes the final adjustments for you 
automatically. Probably he’s right. 

(Of course, learning every step of 
this cost a lot of time and money, 
and most of it cost some lives. It’s 
dangerous being a prospector; for 
the first few out, it was more like 
suicidal.) 

Sometimes you can cycle all the 
way through your fifth digit and get 
nothing at all. So what you do, you 
swear. Then you reset one of the 
other four and go again. It only 
takes a few seconds to cycle, but 
check-pilots have run up a hundred 
hours of new settings before they 
got good color. 

Of course, by the time I went out 
the check-pilots and the course- 
programmers had worked out a 
couple hundred possible settings 
that had been logged as good color 
but not as yet used — as well as all 
the settings that had been used, and 
aren’t worth going back to. Or that 
the crews didn’t come back from. 

But I didn’t know all that at the 
time, and when I sat down in that 
modified Heechee seat it was all 
new. And I don’t know if I can make 
you understand what it felt like. 

41 




I mean, there 1 was, in a seat 
where Heechee had sat half a mil- 
lion years ago. The thing in front of 
me was a target selector. The ship 
could go anywhere. Anywhere! If I 
selected the right target I could find 
myself around Sirius, Procyon, 
maybe even the Magellanic Clouds! 

Teacher got tired of hanging 
head-down and wriggled through, 
squeezing in behind me. “Your 
turn, Broadhead,” she said, resting 
a hand on my shoulder and what 
felt like her breasts on my back. 

I was reluctant to touch. I asked, 
“Isn’t there any way of telling 
where you’re going to wind up?” 

“Probably,” she said, “provid- 
ing you’re a Heechee with pilot 
training.” 

“Not even like one color means 
you’re going farther from here than 
some other color?” 

“Not that anybody here has fig- 
ured out. Of course, they keep try- 
ing. There’s a whole team that 
spends its time programming 
returned- miss ion reports against the 
settings they went out with. So far 
they’ve come up empty. Now let’s 
get on with it, Broadhead. Put your 
whole hand on that first wheel, the 
one the others have used. Shove it. 
It’ll take more muscle than you 
think.” 

It did. In fact, I was almost 
afraid to push it hard enough to 
make it work. She leaned over and 
put her hand on mine, and 1 
realized that the nice musk-oil smell 
that had been in my nostrils for the 
last little while was her. It wasn’t 
just musk, either; her pheromones 
were snuggling nicely into my 
chemoreceptors . It made a nice change 
from the rest of the Gateway stink. 

42 



But all the same, I didn’t get 
even a show of color, although I 
tried for five minutes before she 
waved me away and gave Sheri 
another shot in my place. 

* * * 

When I got back to my room 
somebody'had cleaned it up. I won- 
dered gratefully who that had been, 
but 1 was too tired to wonder very 
long. Until you get used to it, low- 
gravity can be exhausting; you find 
yourself overusing all your muscles 
because you have to relearn a whole 
pattern of economies. 

I slung my hammock and was 
just dozing off when I heard a 
scratching at the lattice of my door 
and Sheri’s voice; “Bob?” 

“What?” 

“Are you asleep?” 

Obviously I wasn’t, but I inter- 
preted the question the way she had 
intended it. “No. I’ve been lying 
here thinking.” 

‘ ‘So was I. Bob?’ ’ 

“Yeah?” 

“Would you like me to come 
into your hammock?’ ’ 

I made an effort to wake myself 
up enough to consider the question 
on its merits. 

“I really want to,” she said. 

“All right. Sure. I mean, glad to 
have you.” She slipped into my 
room, and I slid over in the ham- 
mock, which swung slowly as she 
crawled into it. She was wearing a 
knitted T-shirt and underpants, and 
she felt warm and soft against me 
when we rolled gently together in 
the hollow of the hammock. 

“It doesn’t have to be sex, 
stud,” she said. “I’m easy either 
way.”

“Let’s see what develops. Are 
you scared?’’ 

Her breath was the sweetest- 
smelling thing about her; 1 could 
feel it on my cheek. “A lot more 
than I thought I would be.’’ 

“Why?” 

“Bob — ’’ she squirmed herself 
comfortable and then twisted her 
neck to look at me over her 
shoulder — “you know, you say 
kind of asshole things sometimes?” 

“Sorry.” 

“Well, I mean it. I mean, look 
what we’re doing. We’re going to 
get into a ship that we don’t know 
if it’s going to get where it’s sup- 
posed to go, and we don’t even 
know where it’s supposed to go. 
We go faster than light, nobody 
knows how. We don’t know how 
long we’ll be gone, even if we 
knew where we were going. So we 
could be traveling the rest of our 
lives and die before we got there, 
even if we didn’t run into some- 
thing that would kill us in two sec- 
onds. Right? Right. So how come 
you ask me why I’m scared?” 

“Just making conversation.” I 
curled up along her back and 
cupped a breast, not aggressively 
but because it felt good. 

“And not only that. We don’t 
know anything about the people 
who built these things. How do we 
know this isn’t all a practical joke 
on their part? Maybe their way of 
luring fresh meat into Heechee 
heaven?” 

“We don’t,” I agreed. “Roll 
over this way.” 

“And the ship they showed us 
this morning doesn’t hardly look 
like I thought it was going to be, at 
3ll,” she said, doing as I told her

and putting a hand on the back of 
my neck. 

There was a sharp whistle from 
somewhere, I couldn’t tell where. 

“What’s that?” 

“I don’t know.” It came again, 
sounding both out in the tunnel and, 
louder, inside my room. “Oh, it’s 
the phone.” What I was hearing 
was my own piezophone and the 
ones on either side of me, all ring- 
ing at once. The whistle stopped 
and there was a voice; 

“This is Jim Chou. All you fish 
who want to see what a ship looks 
like when it comes back after a bad 
trip, come down to Docking Station

I eould hear a murmuring from

I could feel Sheri’s heart pounding. 
“We’d better go,” I said. 

“I know. But I don’t think I 
want to much — ”

The ship had made it back to 
Gateway, but not quite all the way.

SAFETY RULES FOR 
GATEWAY SHIPS 

The mechanism for interstellar 
travel is known to be contained 
in the diamond-shaped box 
which is located under the 
center-keel of 3-man and 5-man 
ships, and in the sanitary 
facilities of the 1 -man ships. 

No one has successfully 
opened one of these containers. 
Each attempt has resulted in ex- 
plosion of approximately 1-kiloton 
force. A major research project is 
attempting to penetrate this box 
without destroying it, and if you 
as a limited partner have any in- 
formation or suggestions in this 
connection you should contact 
a Corporation officer at once. 

However, under no cir- 
cumstances attempt to open the 
box yourself! Tampering with it in 
any way, or docking a vessel on 
which the box has been tam- 
pered with, is strictly forbidden. 
The penalty is forfeiture of all 
rights and immediate expulsion 
from Gateway. 

The course-directing equip- 
ment also poses a potential 
danger. Under no circumstances 
should you attempt to change the 
setting once you have begun 
your flight. No vessel in which 
this has been done has ever re- 
turned. 



One of the orbiting cruisers had de- 
tected it and closed in on it. Now a 
tug was bringing it in to the Corpo- 
ration’s own docks, where usually 
only the rockets from the planets 
latched in. There was a hatch big 

44 



enough to hold even a Five. This 
was a Three . what there was 
left of it. 

“Oh, sweet Jesus,” Sheri whis- 
pered. “Bob, what do you suppose 
happened to them?” 

“To the people? They died.” 
There was not really any doubt of 
that. The ship was a wreck. The 
lander stem was gone, just the in- 
terstellar vehicle itself, the mush- 
room cap, was still there, and that 
was bent out of shape, split open, 
seared by heat. Split open! Heechee 
metal, that doesn’t even soften 
under an electric arc! 

But we hadn’t seen the worst of 
it. 

We never did see the worst of it, 
we only heard about it. One man 
was still inside the ship. All over 
the inside of the ship. He had been 
literally spattered around the control 
room, and his remains had been 
baked onto the walls. By what? 
Heat and acceleration, no doubt. 
Perhaps he had found himself skip- 
ping into the upper reaches of a 
sun, or in tight orbit around a neu- 
tron star. The differential in gravity 
might have shredded ship and crew 
like that. But we never knew. 

The other two persons in the 
crew were not there at all. Not that 
it was easy to tell; but the census of 
the organs revealed only one Jaw, 
one pelvis, one spine — though in 
many short pieces. Perhaps the 
other two had been in the lander? 

“Move it, fish!” 

Sheri caught my arm and pulled 
me out of the way. Five uniformed 
crewmen from the cruisers came 
through, in American and Brazilian 
blue, Russian beige, Venusian work 
white and Chinese all-pupose 

galaxy 




black- and- brown. The American 
and the Venusian were female; the 
faces were all different, but the ex- 
pressions were ail the same mixture 
of discipline and distaste. 

“Let’s go.’’ Sheri tugged me 
away. She didn’t want to watch the 
crewmen poke through the rem- 
nants, and neither did I. The 
whole class, Jimmy Chou, Klara 
and die other teachers and all, 
began to straggle back to our 
rooms. Not quite quick enough. We 
had been looking through the ports 
into the lock; when the patrol from 
the cruisers opened it, we got a 
whiff of the air inside. I don’t know 
how to describe it. A little bit like 
overripe garbage being cooked to 
swill to pigs. Even in the rank air 
of Gateway, that was hard to take. 

Teacher dropped off at her own 
level — down pretty low, in the 
high-rent district around Easy 
Level. When she looked up after 
me as I said good night I observed 
for the first time that she was cry- 
ing. 

Sheri and I said good night to the 
Forehands at their door, and I 
turned to her, but she was ahead of 
me. 

“I think I’ll sleep this one out,’’ 
she said. “Sorry, Bob, but, you 
know, I just don’t feel like it any 
more.” 



IX 

I don’t know why I keep going 
back to Sigfrid von Shrink. My ap- 
pointment with him is always on a 
Wednesday afternoon, and he 
doesn’t like it if I drink or dope be- 
fore then. So it blows the whole 

gateway 



day. I pay a lot for those days. You 
don’t Imow what it costs to live the 
way I live. My apartment over 
Washington Square is eighteen 
thousand dollars a month. My resi- 
dence taxes to live under the Big 
Bubble come to another three 
thousand plus. (It doesn’t cost that 
much to stay on Gateway!) I’ve got 
some pretty hefty charge accounts 
for furs, wine, lingerie, jewelry, 
flowers . Sigfrid says I try to 
buy love. All right, I do. What’s 
wrong with that? I can afford it. 
And that’s not mentioning what Full 
Medical costs me. 

Sigfrid, though, comes free. I’m 
covered by the Full Medical for 
psychiatric therapy, any variety I 
like; I could have &oup Grope or 
internal massage for the same price, 
namely nothing. I kid him about 
that sometimes. “Even considering 
that you’re just a bag of rusty 
bolts,” I say, “you’re not much 
good. But your price is right.” 

He asks, “Does that make you 
feel that you yourself are more val- 
uable, if you say that I’m not?” 
“Not particularly . ’ ’ 

“TTien why do you insist on re- 
minding yourself that I’m a 
machine? C3r that I don’t cost any- 
thing? Or that I cannot transcend 
my programming?’ ’ 

“I guess you just piss me off, 
Sigfrid.” I Imow that won’t satisfy 
him, so I explain it. “You ruined 
my morning. This friend, S. Ya. 
Lavorovna, stayed over last night. 
She’s something.” So I tell Si^rid 
a little bit about what S. Ya. is like, 
including what she is like walking 
away from me in stretch pants wi^ 
that long dirty-gold hair hanging 
down to her waist. 

45 




“She sounds very nice,” Sigfrid 
comments. 

“Bet your bolts. Only thing is, 
she wakes up slow in the morning. 
Just when she was getting lively 
again I had to leave my summer 
place, up over Tappan Sea, and 
come down here.” 

“Do you love her. Bob?” 

The answer is no, so I want him 
to think it’s yes. I say, “No.” 

“I think that’s an honest answer, 
Rob,” he says, approvingly, and 
disappointingly. “Is that why 
you’re angry with me?” 

“Oh, I don’t know. Just in a bad 
mood, I guess.” 

“Can you think of any reasons 
why?” 

He waits me out, so after a while 
I say, “Well, I took a licking at 
roulette last night.” 

“More than you can afford?” 
“Christ! No.” But it’s annoying, 
all the same. There are other things, 
too. It’s getting toward that chilly 
time of year. My place over Tappan 
Sea isn’t under the Bubble, so sit- 
ting out on the porch with S. Ya. 
for brunch wasn’t such a good idea. 
I don’t want to mention this to Sig- 
frid. He would say something 
wholly rational like, well, why 
didn’t I have my lunch served in- 
doors? And I would just have to tell 
him all over again that when I was 
a kid it was my dream to own a 
summer place over Tappan Sea and 
have brunch on the porch, looking 
out over it. They’d just dammed the 
Hudson then, when I was about 
maybe twelve. I used to dream a lot 
about Making It Big and living in 
the style of The Rich Folks. Well, 
he’s heard all that. 

Sigfrid clears his throat. “Thank 

46 



you. Bob,” he says, to let me know 
that the hour is over. “Will I see 
you next week?” 

“Don’t you always?” I say, smil- 
ing. “How the time flies. Actually I 
wanted to leave a little early to- 
day.” 

“Did you^ Bob?” 

“I have another date with S. 
Ya.,” I explain. “She’s coming 
back up to the summer place with 
me tonight. Frankly, what she’s 
going to do is better therapy than 
what you do.” 

He says, “Is that all you want 
out of a relationship, Robbie?” 

“You mean, just sex?” The an- 
swer in this case is no, but I don’t 
want him to know just what it is I 
do want out of my relationship with 
S. Ya. Lavorovna. I say, “She’s a 
little different from most of my girl 
friends, Sigfrid. She has about as 
much clout as I do, for one thing. 
Has a damn good job. I admire 
her.” 

Well, I don’t, particularly. Or 
rather, I don’t care much about 
whether I admire her or not. S. Ya. 
has one trait that impresses me even 
more than possessing the sweetest 
rear view that God ever laid on a 
human female. Her damn good job 
is in information handling. She 
went to the Akademogorsk Univer- 
sity, she was a fellow at the Max 
Planck Institute for Machine Intelli- 
gence and she teaches graduate stu- 
dents in the A. I. department at 
N.Y.U. She knows more about Sig- 
frid than Sigfrid knows about him- 
self, and that suggests interesting 
possibilities to me. 

X 

Along about my fifth day on 

GALAXY 




Gateway I got up early and 
splurged, breakfast out in the 
Heecheetown Arms, surrounded by 
tourists, bloody-eyed gamblers from 
the casino across the spindle and 
liberty sailors from the cruisers. It 
felt luxurious, and cost luxurious 
too. It was worth it because of the 
tourists. I could feel their eyes on 
me. I knew they were talking about 
me, particularly a smooth-faced but 
old African type, Dahomeyan or 
Ghanaian, I think, with his very 
young, very plump, very jeweled 
wife. Or whatever. As far as they 
could tell, I was a swashbuckling 
hero. True, I didn’t have any ban- 
gles on my arm, but some of the vet- 
erans didn’t wear them either. 

I basked. I considered ordering 
real eggs and bacon, but that was a 
little more than even my euphoria 
would let me go for, so I settled for 
orange juice (it turned out to be 
real, to my surprise) and a brioche 
and sever^ cups of black Danish 
coffee. All I was really missing was 
a pretty girl across the armboard of 
the chair. There were two nice look- 
ing women who seemed to be the 
liberty crew from the Chinese 
cruiser, neither of them unwilling to 
exchange a few radio messages by 
the glance of the eyes, but I decided 
to keep them as open prospects for 
some future date and paid my check 
(that was painful enough) and left 
for class. 

On the way down 1 caught up 
with the Forehands. The man, 
whose name seemed to be Sess, 
dropped off the down-cable and 
Waited to wish me a polite good 
nioming. “We didn’t see you at 
breakfast,’’ his wife mentioned, so I 
told them where I had been. The 

Gateway 



younger daughter, Lois, looked 
faintly envious. Her mother caught 
the expression and patted her. 
“Don’t worry, hon. We’ll eat there 
before we go back to Venus.’’ To 
me: “We have to watch our pennies 
right now. But when we hit, we’ve 
got some pretty big plans for spend- 
ing the profits.’’ 

“Don’t we all,’’ I said, but 
something was turning over in my 
head. “Are you really going to go 
back to Venus?” 

“Certainly,” they all said, in one 
way or another, and they acted sur- 
prised at the question. Which sur- 
prised me. I hadn’t realized that 
tunnel rats could manage to think of 
that molten stinkpot as home. Sess 
Forehand must have read my ex- 
pression, too. They were a reserved 
family, but they chdn’t miss much. 
He grinned and said: 

“It’s our home, after all. So is 
Gateway, in a way.” 

That was astonishing. “Actually, 
we’re related to the first man to find 
Gateway, Sylvester Macklen. 
You’ve heard of him?” 

“How could I not.” 

“He was a sort of a cousin. I 
guess you know the whole story?” I 
started to say I did, but he obvi- 
ously was proud of his cousin, and 
I couldn’t blame him, and so I 
heard a slightly different version of 
the familiar legend: “He was in one 
of the South Pole tunnels, and 
found a ship. God knows how he 
got it to the surface, but he did, and 
he got in and evidently squeezed the 
go-teat, and it went where it was 
programmed — here . ’ ’ 

“Doesn’t the Corporation pay a 
royalty?” I asked. “I mean, if 
they’re going to pay for discoveries, 

47 




what discovery would be more 
worth paying for?” 

‘‘Not to us, anyway,” said 
Louise Forehand, somewhat som- 
berly; money was a hard subject 
with the Forehands. ‘‘Of course, 
Sylvester didn’t set out to find 
Gateway. As you know from what 
we’ve been hearing in class, the 
ships have automatic return. 
Wherever you go, you just squeeze 
the go-teat and you come straight 
back here. Only that didn’t help 
Sylvester, because he was here. It 
was the return leg of a round trip 
with about a zillion years 
stopover.” 

‘‘He was smart and strong,” Sess 
took up the story. ‘‘You have to be 
to explore. So he didn’t panic. But 
by the time anybody came out here 
to investigate he was out of life- 
support. He could have lived a little 
longer. He could have used the lox 
and H-two from the lander tanks for 
air and water. I used to wonder why 
he didn’t.” 



‘‘Because he would have starved 
anyway,” Louise cut in, defending 
her relative. 

‘‘I think so. Anyway, they found 
his body, with his notes in his 
hand. He had cut his throat.” 

They were nice people, but I had 
heard all this, and they were mak- 
ing me late for class. 

Of course, class wasn’t all that 
exciting just at that point. We were 
up to Hammock Slinging (Basic) 
and Toilet Flushing (Advanced). 
You may wonder why they didn’t 
spend more time actually teaching 
us how to fly the ships. That’s sim- 
ple. The things flew themselves, as 
the Forehands, and everybody else, 
had been telling me. Even the land- 
ers were no sweat to operate, al- 
though they did require a hand on 
the controls. Once you were in the 
lander all you had to do was com- 
pare a three-D, sort of holographic 
representation of the immediate area 
of space with where you wanted to 
go, and maneuver a point of light in

the tank to the point you wanted to 
reach. The lander went there. It cal- 
culated its own trajectories and cor- 
rected its own deviations. It took a 
little muscular coordination to get 
the hang of twisiting that point of 
light to where you wanted it to go, 
but it was a forgiving system. 

Between the sessions of flushing 
practice and hammock drill we 
talked about what we were going to 
do when we graduated. The launch 
schedules were kept up to date and 
displayed on the PV monitor in our 
class whenever anyone pushed the 
button. Some of them had names at- 
tached to them, and one or two of 
the names I recognized. Tikki 
Trumbull was a girl I had danced 
with and sat next to in the mess hall 
once or twice. She was an out-pilot, 
and as she needed crew I thought of 
joining her. But the wiseheads told 
me that out-missions were a waste 
of time. 

I should tell you what an out- 
pilot is. He’s the guy who ferries 
fresh crews to Gateway Two. There 
are about a dozen Fives that do that 
as a regular run. They take four 
people out (which would be what 
Tikki wanted people for), and then 
the pilot comes back alone, or with 
returning prospectors — if any — and 
what they’ve found. Usually there’s 
somebody. 

The team who found Gateway 
Two are the ones we all dreamed 
about. They made it. Man, did they 
ftiake it! Gateway Two was another 
Gateway, nothing mote or less, ex- 
'^spt that it happened to orbit around 
another star than our own. There 
"'as not much more in the way of 
Measure on Gateway Two than there 
""as on our own Gateway; the 

'Gateway 



Heechee had swept everything 
pretty clean, except for the ships 
themselves. And there weren’t 
nearly as many ships there, only 
about a hundred and fifty, compared 
to almost a thousand on our old 
original solar Gateway. But a 
hundred and fifty ships are worth 
finding all by themselves. Not to 
mention the fact that they accept 
some destinations that our local 
Gateway’s ships don’t appear to. 

The ride out to Gateway Two 
seems to be about four hundred 
light-years, and takes a hundred and 
nine days each way. Two’s princi- 
pal star is a bright blue B-type. 
They think it is Alcyone in the 
Pleiades, but there is some doubt. 
Well, actually that’s not Gateway 
Two’s real star. It doesn’t orbit the 
big one, but a little cinder of a red 
dwarf nearby. They say the dwarf is 
probably a distant binary with the 
blue B, but they also say it 
shouldn’t be because of the differ- 
ence in ages of the two stars. Give 
them a few more years to argue and 
they’ll probably know. One won- 
ders why the Heechee would have 
put their spacelines junction in orbit 
around so undistinguished a star, 
but one wonders a lot about the 
Heechee. 

However, all that doesn’t affect 
the pocketbook of the team who 
happened to find the place. They 
get a royalty on everything that any 
later prospector finds! I don’t know 
what they’ve made so far, but it has 
to be in the tens of millions apiece. 
Maybe the hundreds. And that’s 
why it doesn’t pay to go with an 
out-pilot; you don’t really have a 
much better chance of scoring, and 
you have to split what you get.

So we went down the list of up- 
coming launches and hashed them 
over in the light of our five-day ex- 
pertise. Which wasn’t much. We 
appealed to Gelle-Klara Moynlin for 
advice. After all, she’d been out 
twice. She studied the list of flights 
and names, pursing her lips. “Terry 
Yakamora’s a decent guy,’’ she 
said. “I don’t know Pa^uk, but it 
might be worth taking a chance on 
that one. Lay off Dorean’s flight. 
There’s a million-dollar bonus, but 
what they don’t tell you is that 
they’ve got a bastard control board 
in it. The Corporation’s experts 
have put in a computer that’s sup- 
posed to override the Heechee target 
selector, and I wouldn’t trust it. 
And, of course, I wouldn’t recom- 
mend a One in any circumstances.’’ 

Lois Forehand asked, “Which 
one would you take if it was up to 
you, Klara?’’ 

She scowled thoughtfully, rub- 
bing that dark left eyebrow with the 
tips of her fingers. “Maybe Terry. 
Well, any of them. But I’m not 
going out again for a while.’’ I 
wanted to ask her why, but she 
turned away from the screen and 
said, “All right, gang, let’s get 
back to the drill. Remember, up for 
pee, down, close, wait ten and up 
for poo.’’ 

* * * 

I celebrated completing the week 
on ship-handling by offering to buy 
Dane Metchnikov a drink. That 
wasn’t my first intention. My first 
intention had been to buy Sheri a 
drink and drink it in bed, but she 
was off somewhere. So I worked 
the buttons on the piezophone and 
got Metchnikov. 

50 



He sounded surprised at my of- 
fer. “Thanks,” he said, and then 
considered. “Tell you what. Give 
me a hand carrying some stuff, and 
then I’ll buy you a drink.” 

So I went down to his place, 
which was only one level below 
Baby; his room was not much better 
than my own, and bare, except for 
a couple of full carryalls. He looked 
at me almost friendlily. “You’re a 
prospector now,” he grunted. 

“Not really. I’ve got two more 
courses.” 

“Well, this is the last you see of 
me, anyway. I’m shipping out with 
Terry Yakamora tomorrow.” 

I was surprised. “Didn’t you just 
get back, like ten days ago?” 

“You can’t make any money 
hanging around here. All’s I was 
waiting for was the right crew. You 
want to come to my farewell party? 
Terry’s place. Twenty hundred.” 
“That sounds fine,” I said. “Can 
I bring Sheri?” 

“Oh, sure, she’s coming anyway, 
I think. Buy you the drink there, if 
you don’t mind. Give me a hand 
and we’ll get this stuff stored.” 

He had accumulated a surprising 
amount of goods. I wondered how 
he had managed to stash them all 
away in a room as tiny as my own: 
three fabric carriers all stuffed full, 
holodisks and a viewer, book tapes 
and a few actual books. I took the 
carriers. On Earth they would have 
weighed more than 1 could handle, 
probably fifty or sixty kilos, but of 
course on Gateway lifting them was 
no problem, it was only tugging 
them through the corridors and jock- 
eying them down the shafts that 
was tricky. 1 had the mass, but 
Metchnikov had the problems, since 

GALAXY 




what he was carrying was in odd 
shapes and varying degrees of 
fragility. It was about an hour’s 
haul, acutally. We wound up in a 
part of the asteroid I’d never seen 
before, where an elderly Pakistani 
woman counted the pieces, gave 
Metchnikov a receipt and began 
dragging them away down a thickly 
vine-grown corridor. 

“Whew,” He grunted. “Well, 
thanks.” 

“You’re welcome.” We started 
back toward a dropshaft and he 
said, making coversation, I assume 
out of some recognition that he 
owed me a social favor and should 
practice some social skills: 

“So how was the course?” 

“You mean apart from the fact 
that I’ve just finished it and still 
don’t have any idea how to fly 
those God-damned ships?” 

“Well, of course you don’t,” he 
said, irritably. “The course isn’t 
going to teach you that. It just gives 
you the general idea. The way you 
leam, you do it. Only hard part’s 
the lander, of course. Anyway, 
you’ve got your issue of tapes?” 
“Oh, yes.” There were six cas- 
settes of them. Each of us had been 
given a set when we completed the 
first week’s course. They had every- 
thing that had been said, plus a lot 
of stuff about different kinds of con- 
trols that the Corporation might, or 
might not, fit on a Heechee board 
and so on. 

“So play them over,” he said. 
“If you’ve got any sense you’ll take 
them with you when you ship out. 
Got plenty of time to play them 
then. Mostly the ships fly them- 
selves anyway.” 

“They’d better,” I said, doubting 

Gateway 



it. “So long.” He waved and 
dropped onto the down-cable with- 
out looking back. Apparently I had 
agreed to take the drink he owed 
me at the party. Where it wouldn’t 
cost him anything. 

I thought of looking for Sheri 
again, and decided against it. I was 
in a part of Gateway I didn’t know 
and of course I’d left my map back 
in my room. I drifted along, more 
or less at random, past star-points 
where some of the tunnels smelled 
musty and dusty and there weren’t 
many people, then through an inha- 
bited section that seemed to be 
mostly Eastern European. I didn’t 
recognize the languages, but there 
were little notes and wall signs 
hanging from the everywhere- 
growing ivy that were in alphabets 
that looked Cyrillic or even 
stranger. I came to a drop-shaft, 
thought for a moment and then 
caught hold of the up cable. The 
easy way not to be lost on Gateway 
is to go up until you get to the 
spindle, where “up” ends. 

But this time I found myself pass- 
ing Central Park and, on impulse, 
dropped off the up cable to sit by a 
tree for a while. 

Central Park isn’t really a park. 
It’s a large tunnel not far from the 
center of rotation of the asteroid 
which has been devoted to vegeta- 
tion. I found orange trees there 
(which explained the juice) and 
grape vines; and ferns and mosses, 
but no grass. I am not sure why. 
Probably it has something to do 
with planting only varieties that are 
sensitive to the available light, 
mostly the blue gleam from the 
Heechee metal all around, and 
perhaps they couldn’t find a grass 

51 




that could use it efficiently for its 
photochemistiy. The principal rea- 
son for having Central Park in the 
first place was to suck up CO 2 and 
give back oxygen; that was before 
they spread planting all over the 
tunnels. But it also killed smells, or 
anyway it was supposed to, a little, 
and it grew a certain amount of 
food. The whole thing was maybe 
eighty meters long and twice as tall 
as 1 was. It was broad enough to 
have room for some winding paths. 
The stuff they grew in looked a lot 
like good old genuine Earthside 
dirt. What it was, really, was a 
humus made out of the sewage 
sludge from the couple of thousand 
people who had used Gateway 
toilets, but you couldn’t tell that by 
looking at it, or by smelling it, 
either. 

The first tree big enough to sit by 
was no good for that purpose; it 
was a mulberry, and under it were 
spread out sheets of fine netting to 
catch the dropping fruit. I walked 
past it, and down the path there 
were a woman and a child. 

A child! I hadn’t known there 
were any children on Gateway. She 
was a little bit of a thing, maybe a 
year and a half, playing with a ball 
so big, and so lazy in the light grav- 
ity, that it was like a balloon. 

“Hello, Bob.’’ 

That was the other surprise; the 
woman who greeted me was 
Gelle-Klara Moynlin. I said without 
thinking, “I didn’t know you had a 
little girl.” 

“I don’t. This is Kathy Francis, 
and her mother lets me borrow her 
sometimes. Kathy, this is Bob 
Broadhead.” 

“Hello, Bob,” the little thing 



called, studying me. “Are you a 
friend of Klara’s?’ ’ 

“I hope so. She’s my teacher. 
Do you want to play catch?” 

Kathy finished her study of me 
and said precisely, each word sepa- 
rate from the one before it but as 
clearly formed as an adult’s, “I 
don’t know how to play catch, but I 
will get six mulberries for you. 
That’s all you can have.” 

“Thank you.” I slumped down 
next to Klara, who was hugging her 
knees and watching the child. 
“She’s cute.” 

“Well, I guess so. It’s hard to 
judge, when there aren’t very many 
other children around.” 

“She’s not a prospector, is she?” 
I wasn’t exactly joking, but Klara 
laughed warmly. “Her parents are 
permanent party. Well, most of the 
time. Right now her mother’s off 
prospecting; they do that some- 
times, a lot of them. You can spend 
just so much time trying to figure 
out what the Heechee were up to 
before you want to try your own 
solutions to the puzzles.” 

“Sounds dangerous.” 

She shushed me. Kathy came 
back, with three of my mulberries 
in each open hand, so as not to 
crush them. She had a funny way of 
walking, which didn’t seem to use 
much of the thigh and calf muscles; 
she sort of pushed herself up on the 
ball of each foot in turn, and let 
herself float to the next step. After I 
figured that out I tried it for myself, 
and it turned out to be a pretty effi- 
cient way of walking in near-zero 
gravity, but my reflexes kept lous- 
ing it up. I suppose you have to be 
bom on Gateway to come by it na- 
turally.

Klara in the paik was a lot more 
relaxed and feminine than Klara the 
teacher. The eyebrows that had 
looked masculine and angry 
changed to looking outdoorsy and 
friendly. She still smelled very nice. 

It was pretty pleasant, chatting 
with her, while Kathy stepped dain- 
tily around us, playing with her 
ball. We compared places we’d 
been, and didn’t find any in com- 
mon. The one thing we did find in 
common was that I was bom almost 
the same day as her two-year- 
younger brother. 

“Did you like your brother?’’ I 
asked, a gambit played for the hell 
of it. 

“Well, sure. He was the baby. 
But he was an Aries, born under 
Mercury and the Moon. Made him 
fickle and moody, of course. I think 
he would have had a complicated 
life.” 

I was less interested in asking her 
about what happened to him than in 
asking if she really believed in that 
garbage, but that didn’t seem tact- 
ful, and anyway she went on talk- 
ing. “I’m a Saggitarius, myself. 
And you — oh, of course. You must 
be the same as Davie.” 

“I guess so,” I said, being po- 
lite. “I, uh, don’t go much for as- 
trology.” 

“Not astrology, genethlialogy. 
One’s supersition, the other’s sci- 
ence.” 

“Urn.” 

She laughed. “I can see you’re a 
scoffer. Doesn’t matter. If you be- 
lieve, all right; if you don’t — well, 
you don’t have to believe in the law 
of gravity to get mashed when you 
fall off a two-hundred-story build- 
ing.”

Kathy, who had sat down beside 
us, inquired politely, “Are you hav- 
ing an argument?” 

“Not really, honey.’’ Klara 
stroked her head. 

“That’s good, Klara, because I 
have to go to the bathroom now and 
I don’t think I can, here.” 

“It’s time to go anyway. Nice to 
see you. Bob. Watch out for melan- 
choly, hear?” And they went away 
hand in hand, Klara trying to copy 
the little girl’s odd walk. Looking 
very nice ... for a flake. 

* * * 

That night I took Sheri to Dane 
Metchnikov’s going-away party. 
Klara was there, looking even nicer 
in a bare-midriff pants suit. “I 

53 




didn’t know you knew Dane 
Metchnikov,” I said. 

“Which one is he? I mean, Ter- 
ry’s the one who invited me. Com- 
ing inside?’’ 

The party had spilled out into the 
tunnel. I peered through the door 
and was surprised to find how much 
room there was inside; Terry 
Yakamora had two full rooms, both 
more than twice the size of mine. 
The bath was private and really did 
contain a bath, or at least a 
showerhead. “Nice place,’’ I said 
admiringly, and then discovered 
from something another guest said 
that Klara lived right down the tun- 
nel. That changed my opinion of 
Klara: if she could afford the high- 
rent district, why was she still on 
Gateway? Why wasn’t she back 
home spending her money and hav- 
ing fun? Or contrariwise, if she was 
still on Gateway, why was she fool- 
ing around keeping barely even with 
the head tax by working as an assis- 
tant instructor, instead of going out 
for another killing? But I didn’t get 
a chance to ask her. She did most 
of her dancing that night with Terry 
Yakamora and the others in the out- 
going crew. 

I lost track of Sheri until she 
came over to me after a slow, al- 
most unmoving fox-trot, bringing 
her partner. He was a very young 
man — a boy, actually; he looked 
about nineteen. He looked familiar: 
dark skin, almost white hair, a wisp 
of a jaw-beard that drew an arc 
from sidebum to sidebum by way 
of the underside of his chin. He 
hadn’t come up from Earth with 
me. He wasn’t in our class. But I’d 
seen him somewhere. 

Sheri introduced us. “Bob, you 

54 



know Francesco Hereira?’’ 

“I don’t think so.’’ 

“He’s from the Brazilian 
cruiser.’’ Then I remembered. He 
was one of the inspectors who had 
gone in to fish through the baked 
gobbets of flesh on the shipwreck 
we’d seen a few days earlier. He 
was a torpedoman, according to his 
cuff stripes. They give the cruiser 
crews temporary duty as guards on 
Gateway, and sometimes they give 
them liberty there too. He’d come 
in in the regular rotation about the 
time we arrived. Somebody put on 
a tape for a hora just then, and after 
we were through dancing, a little 
out of breath, Hereira and I found 
ourselves leaning against the wall 
side by side, trying to stay out of 
the way of the rest of the party. I 
told him I had just remembered see- 
ing him at the wreck. 

“Ah, yes, Mr. Broadhead. I re- 
call.” 

, “Tough job,” I said, for some- 
thing to say. “Isn’t it?” 

He had been drinking enough to 
answer me, I guess. “Well, Mr. 
Broadhead,” he said analytically, 
“the technical description of that 
part of my job is ‘search and regis- 
try.’ It is not always tough. For in- 
stance, in a short time you will no 
doubt go out, and when you come 
back I, or someone else in my job, 
will poke into your holes, Mr. 
Broadhead. I will turn out your 
pockets, and weigh and measure 
and photograph everything in your 
ship. That is to make sure you do 
not smuggle anything of value out 
of your vessel and off Gateway 
without paying the Corporation its 
due share. Then I register what I 
have found; if it is nothing, I write 

GALAXY 




‘nil’ on the form, and another 
crewman from another cruiser cho- 
sen at random does the same thing 
exactly. So you will have two of us 
prying into you.” 

It didn’t sound like a lot of fun 
for me, but not as bad as I had 
thought at first. I said so. 

He flashed small, very white 
teeth. ‘‘When the prospector to be 
searched is Sheri or Gelle-Klara 
over there, no, not bad at all. One 



can quite enjoy it. But I have not 
much interest in searching males, 
Mr. Broadhead. Especially when 
they are dead. Have you ever been 
in the presence of five human 
bodies that have been dead, but not 
embalmed, for three months? That 
was what it was like on the first 
ship I inspected. I do not think any- 
thing will be that bad ever again.” 
Then Sheri came up and de- 
manded him for another dance and

the party went on. 

There were a lot of parties. It 
turned out there always had been, it 
was just that we new fish hadn’t 
been part of the network, but as we 
got nearer graduating we got to 
know more people. There were 
farewell parties. There were 
welcome-back parties, but not 
nearly as many. Even when crews 
did come back, there was not al- 
ways any reason to celebrate. Some- 
times they had been gone so long 
they had lost touch with all their 
friends. Sometimes, when they had 
hit fairly lucky, they didn’t want 
anything but to get off Gateway on 
the way home. And sometimes, of 
course, they couldn’t have a party 
because parties aren’t permitted in 
the intensive care rooms at Terminal 
Hospital. 

It wasn’t all parites; we had to 
study. By the end of the course we 
were supposed to be fully expert in 
ship-handling, survival techniques 
and the appraisal of trade goods. 
Well, I wasn’t. Sheri was even 
worse off than I. She took to the 
ship-handling all right, and she had 
a shrewd eye for detail that would 
help her a lot in appraising the 
worth of anything she might find on 
a prospecting trip. But she didn’t 
seem able to get the survival course 
through her head. 

Studying with her for the final 
examinations was misery: 

“Okay,” I’d tell her, “this one’s 
a type F star with a planet with 
point-eight surface G, a partial pres- 
sure of oxygen of 130 millibars, 
mean temperature at the equator 
plus forty Celsius. So what do you 
wear to the party?” 

She said accusingly, “You’re 

56 



giving me an easy one. That’s prac- 
tically Earth.” 

“So what’s the answer, Sheri?” 
She scratched reflectively under 
her breast. Then she shook her head 
impatiently. “Nothing. I mean, I 
wear an airsuit on the way down, 
but once I get to the surface I could 
walk around in a bikini.” 

“Shithead! You’d be maybe dead 
in twelve hours. Earth-normal con- 
ditions means there’s a good chance 
of an Earth normal-type biology. 
Which means pathogens that could 
eat you up.” 

“So all right — ” she hunched her 
shoulders — “so I’d keep the suit un- 
til, uh, I tested for pathogens.” 
“And how do you do that?” 

“I use the fucking kit, stupid!” 
She added hastily, before I could 
say anything, “I mean I take the, 
let’s see, the Basic Metabolism 
disks out of the freezer and activate 
them. I stay in orbit for twenty-four 
hours until they’re ripe, then when 
I’m down on the surface I expose 
them and take readings with my, 
uh, with my C-44.” 

“C-33. There’s no such thing as 
a C-44.” 

“So all right. Oh, and also I 
pack a set of antigen boosters, so if 
there’s a marginal problem with 
some sort of microorganism I can 
give myself a booster shot and get 
temporary immunity.” 

I guess that’s all right, so far,” I 
said doubtfully. In practice, of 
course, she wouldn’t need to re- 
member all that. She would read the 
directions on the packages, or play 
her course tapes, or better still she 
would be out with somebody who 
had been out before and would 
know the rop>es. But there was also 

GALAXY 




the chance that something unfore- 
seen would go wrong and she 
would be on her own resources, not 
to mention the fact that she had a 
final test to take and pass. “What 
else, Sheri?” 

“The usual. Bob! Do I have to 
run through the whole list? All 
right. Radio-relay; spare powerpack; 
the geology kit; ten-day food 
ration — and no, I don’t eat anything 
I find on the planet at all, not even 
if there’s a MacDonald’s hamburger 
stand right next to the ship. And an 
extra lipstick and some sanitary 
napkins.” 

I waited. She smiled prettily, 
outwaiting me. “What about 
weapons?” 

“Weapons?” 

“Yes, God damn it! If it’s nearly 
Earth normal, what are the chances 
of life being there?” 

“Oh, yes. Let’s see. Well, of 
course if I need them I take them. 
But, wait a minute, first I sniff for 
methane in the atmosphere with the 
spectrometer reading from orbit. If 
there’s no methane signature there’s 
no life, so I don’t have to worry.” 
“There’s no mammalian life, and 
you do have to worry. What about 
insects? Reptiles? Dluglatches?” 
“Dluglatches?” 

“A word I just made up to de- 
scribe a kind of life we’ve never 
heard of that doesn’t generate 
methane in its gut but eats people.” 
“Oh, sure. All right. I’ll take a 
sidearm and twenty rounds of soft- 
nosed ammo. Give me another 
one.” 

And so we went on. When we 
first started rehearsing each other 
what we usually said at a point like 
that was either, “Well, I won’t 

Gateway 



have to worry, because you’ll be 
there with me anyway,” or, “Kiss 
me, you fool.” But we’d kind of 
stopped saying that. 

In spite of it all, we graduated. 
All of us. 

We gave ourselves a graduation 
party, Sheri and me, and all four of 
the Forehands, and the others who 
had come up from Earth with us 
and the six or seven who had, ap- 
peared from one place or another. 
We didn’t invite any outsiders, but 
our teachers weren’t outsiders. They 
all showed up to wish us well. 
Klara came in late, drank a quick 
drink, kissed us all, male and 
female, even the Finnish kid with 
the language block who’d had to 
take all of his instruction on tapes. 
He was going to have a problem. 

They have instruction tapes 
for every language you ever heard 
of; if they don’t happen to have 
your exact dialect they run a set 
through the translating computer 
from the nearest analogue. That’s 
enough to get you through the 
course, but after that the problem 
starts. You can’t reasonably expect 
to be accepted by a crew that can’t 
talk to you. His block kept him 
from learning any other language, 
and there was not a living soul on 
Gateway who spoke Finnish. 

We took over the tunnel three 
doors in each direction past our 
own, Sheri’s, the Forehands’ and 
mine. We danced and sang until it 
was late enough for some of us to 
begin to drop off and then we di- 
aled in the list of open launches on 
the PV screen. Full of beer and 
weed, we cut cards for first pick, 
and I won.

Something happened inside my 
head. I didn’t sober up, really. That 
wasn’t it. I was still feeling cheerful 
and sort of warm all over and open 
to all the personality signals that 
were coming in. But a part of my 
mind opened up and a pair of 
clear-seeing eyes peered out at the 
future and made a judgment. 
“Well,” I said, “I guess I’ll pass 
my chance right now. Sess, you’re 
number two; you take your pick. ’ ’ 

“Thirty-one oh nine,” he said 
promptly; all the Forehands had 
made up their minds in family meet- 
ing, long since. “Thanks, Bob.” 

I gave him a carefree, drunken 
wave. He didn’t really owe me any- 
thing. That was a One, and I 
wouldn’t have taken it for any 
price. For that matter, there wasn’t 
anything on the board I liked. I 
grinned at Klara and winked; she 
looked serious for a minute, then 
winked back, but still looked seri- 
ous. I knew she realized what I had 
come to understand: all these 
launches were rejects. The best ones 
had been snapped up as soon as 
they were announced by returnees 
and permanent party. 

58 



Sheri had drawn fifth pick, and 
when it came her turn she looked 
directly at me. “I’m going to take 
that Three if I can fill it up. What 
about it. Bob? Are you going to 
come or not?’ ’ 

I chuckled. “Sheri,” I said, 
sweetly reasonable, “there’s not a 
returnee that wants it. It’s an ar- 
mored job. You don’t know where 
the hell it might be going. And 
there’s a lot too much green in the 
guidance panel to suit me.” (No- 
body really knew what the colors 
meant, of course, but there was a 
superstition in the school that a lot 
of green meant a super-dangerous 
mission.) 

“It’s the only open Three, and 
there’s a bonus.” 

“Not me, honey. Ask Klara; 
she’s been around a long time and I 
respect her judgment.” 

“I’m asking you. Bob.” 

“No. I’ll wait for something bet- 
ter.” 

“I’m not waiting. Bob. I already 
talked to Willa Forehand, and she’s 
agreeable. If worst comes to worst 
we’ll fill it out with — anybody at 
all,” she said, looking at the Fin- 
nish kid, smiling drunkenly to him- 
self as he stared at the launch 
board. “But — you and I did say we 
were going out together.” 

I shook my head. 

“So stay here and rot,” she 
flared. 

“Your girl friend’s just as scared 
as you are!” 

TTiose sober eyes inside my skull 
looked at Klara, and the frozen," 
unmoving expression on her face; 
and, wonderingly, I realized Sheri 
was right. Klara was like me. We 
were both afraid to go.

I say to Sigfrid, “This isn’t going 
to be a very productive session, I’m 
afraid. I’m just plain exhausted. 
Sexually, if you know what I 
mean.’’ 

“I certainly do know what you 
mean. Bob.’’ 

“So I don’t have much to talk 
about.’’ 

“Do you remember any 
dreams?’ ’ 

I squirm on the couch. As it hap- 
pens, I do remember one or two. I 
say, “No.” Sigfrid is always after 
me to tell him my dreams. I don’t 
like it. 

When he first suggested it I told 
him I didn’t dream very often. He 
said patiently, “I think you know. 
Bob, that everyone dreams. You 



may not remember the dreams in 
the waking state. But you can, if 
you try.” 

“No, I can’t. You can. You’re a 
machine.” 

“I know I’m a machine. Bob, 
but we’re talking about you. Will 
you try an experiment?” 

“Maybe.” 

“It isn’t hard. Keep a pencil and 
a piece of paper beside your bed. 
As soon as you wake up, write 
down- what you remember. ’ ’ 

“But I don’t ever remember any- 
thing at all about my dreams.” 

“I think it’s worth a try. Bob.” 
Well, I did. And, you know, I 
actually did begin to remember my 
dreams. Little tiny fragments, at 
first. And I’d write them down, and 
sometimes I would tell them to Sig- 
frid and they would make him as

happy as anything. He just loved 
dreams. 

Me, I didn’t see much use in 
it. Well, not at first. But then 
something happened that made a 
Christian out of me. 

One morning I woke up out of a 
dream that was so unpleasant and so 
real that for a few moments 1 
wasn’t sure it wasn’t actual fact, 
and so awful that I didn’t dare let 
myself believe it was only a dream. 
It shook me so much that I began to 
write it down, as fast as I could, 
every bit I could remember. Then 
there was a P-phone call. I an- 
swered it; and, do you know, in Just 
the minute I was on the phone, I 
forgot the whole thing! Couldn’t 
remember one bit of it. Until I 
looked at what I had written down, 
and then it all came back to me. 

Well, when I saw Sigfrid a day 
or two later. I’d forgotten it again! 
As though it had never happened. 
But I had saved the piece of paper, 
and I had to read it to him. That 
was one of the times when I 
thought he was most pleased with 
himself and with me, too. He wor- 
ried over that dream for the whole 
hour. He found symbols and mean- 
ings in every bit of it. I don’t re- 
member what they were, but I re- 
member that for me it wasn’t any 
fun at all. 

As a matter of fact, do you know 
what’s really funny? I threw away 
the paper on the way out of his of- 
fice. And now I couldn’t tell you what 
that dream was to save my life. 

“I see you don’t want to talk 
about dreams,” says Sigfrid. ‘‘Is 
there anything you do want to talk 
about?” 

‘‘Not really.” 

60 



He doesn’t answer for a moment, 
and I know he is just biding his 
time to outwait me so that I will say 
something, I don’t know, something 
foolish. So I say, ‘‘Can I ask you a 
question, Sigfrid?” 

‘‘Can’t you always, Rob?” Some- 
times I think he’s actually ^ing to 
smile. I mean, really smile. His 
voice sounds like it. 

‘‘Well, what do you do with all 
the things I tell you?” 

‘‘I’m not sure I understand the 
question, Robbie. If you’re asking 
what the information storage pro- 
gram is, the answer is quite techni- 
cal.’* 

‘‘No, that’s not what I mean.” I 
hesitate, trying to make sure what 
the question is, and wondering why 
I want to ask it. I guess it all goes 
back to Sylvia, who was a lapsed 
Catholic. I really envied her her 
church, and let her know I thought 
she was dumb to have left it, be- 
cause I envied her the confession. 
The inside of my head was littered 
with all these doubts and fears that I 
couldn’t get rid of. I would have 
loved to unload them on the parish 
priest. I could see that you could 
make quite a nice hierarchical flow 
pattern, with ail the shit from inside 
my own head flushing into the con- 
fessional, where the parish priest 
flushes it onto the diocesan monsig- 
nor (or whoever; I don’t really 
know much about the Church), and 
it all winds up with the Pope, who 
is the settling tank for all the 
world’s sludge of pain and misery 
and guilt, until he passes it on by 
transmitting it direct to God. (I 
mean, assuming the existence of a 
God, or at least assuming that there 
is an address called ‘‘God” to 

GALAXY 




which you can sent the shit.) 

Anyway, the point is that I sort 
of had a vision of the same system 
in psychotherapy: local drains going 
into branch sewers going into com- 
munity trunk lines treeing out of 
flesh and blood psychiatrists, if you 
see what I mean. If Sigfrid were a 
real person, he wouldn’t be able to 
hold all the misery that’s poured 
into him. He would have his own 
problems, to begin with. He would 
have mine, because that’s how I 
would get rid of them, by unloading 
them onto him. He would also have 
those of all the other unloaders who 
share the hot couch; and he would 
unload all that, because he had to, 
onto the next man up, who shrank 
him, and so on and so on until they 
got to — who? The ghost of Sigmund 
Freud? 

But Sigfrid isn’t real. He’s a 
machine. He can’t feel pain. So 
where does all that pain and slime 

go! 

I tried to explain all that to him, 
ending with: “Don’t you see, Sig- 
firid? If I give you my pain and you 
give it to someone else, it has to 
end somewhere. It doesn’t feel real 
to me that it just winds up as 
magnetic bubbles in a piece of 
quartz that nobody e\CT feels.” 

“I don’t think it’s profitable to 
discuss the nature of pain with you, 
Rob.’’ 

“Is it profitable to discuss 
whether you’re real or not?’’ 

He almost sighs. “Bob,’’ he 
says, “I don’t think it’s profitable 
to discuss the nature of reality with 
you, either. I know I’m a machine. 
You know I’m a machine. What is 
the purpose in our being here? Are 
We here to help me?’’ 

gateway 



“I sometimes wonder,’’ I say, 
sulking. 

“I don’t think you actually won- 
der about that. I think you know 
that you are here to help you, and 
the way to do it is by trying to 
make something happen inside you. 
What I do with the information may 
be interesting to your curiosity, and 
it may also provide you with an ex- 
cuse to spend these sessions on in- 
tellectual conversation instead of 
therapy — ’’ 

“Touche, Sigfrid,’’ I interrupt. 

“Yes. But it is what you do with 
it that makes the difference in how 
you feel, and whether you function 
somewhat better or somewhat worse 
in situations that are important to 
you. Please concern yourself with 
the inside of your own head. Bob, 
not mine.’’ 

I say admiringly, “You sure are 
one fucking intelligent machine, 
Sigfrid.’’ 

He says, “I have the impression 
that what you’re actually saying 
there is, T hate your fucking guts, 
Sigfrid.’ ’’ 

I have never heard him say any- 
thing like that before, and it takes 
me aback, until I remember that as 
a matter of fact I have said exactly 
that to him, not once but quite a 
few times. And that it’s true. 

I do hate his guts. 

He is trying to help me, and I 
hate him for it very much. I think 
about sweet, sexy S. Ya. and how 
willing she is to do anything I ask 
her, pretty nearly. I want, a lot, to 
make Sigfrid hurt.

1 HE BLEACHED SKULL rolled down 
the broken steps, leaving droppings 
of dust-diy bone on the pitted con- 
crete. At the bottom the gritty wind 
caught it up and bowled it into a 
patch of tall coarse grass. George 
Willits forced himself to watch it 
go, restrained his impulse to re- 
trieve and protect it. It was litter. 

Rubbing his biceps with his left 
hand, he tried to massage away the 
pain. It didn’t work; when he lifted 
his fingers, the skin was puffy and 
red. “Which way?’’ he asked. 

The old woman pointed to the top 
of the broad staircase. “Up there, 
in the Great Hall.’’ The wind, tug- 
ging strands of her grey hair loose, 
flailed her leathery skin with them. 
She seemed not to mind. 

“Thank you. Grandmother.’’ The 
title amused him; she wasn’t much 
older than he was. 

“He won’t see you, you know.’’ 

“Why not?’’ 

Her black eyes, bright and watch- 
ful, were as emotionless as a bird’s. 
“You’re a foreign devil.’’ That was 
a statement, not an insult. Her 
cracked voice was obviously accus- 
tomed to using the two words as 
one. 



“We’ll see what he says. Will 
you come?” 

“No.” She glanced at his impas- 
sive features, brushed dust off her 
quilted jacket, and went on: “I am 
old, and poor, and have no time for 
the Helmsman. I must return at 
once, because the worthless wife of 
my oldest son will spoil the soup if 
I am not there to correct her. Please 
allow me to go.” 

He waved a hand, and one of the 
expedition’s cameramen sprinted 
across the rubble-strewn plaza. A 
smile creased his chapped lips. The 
deference they paid him was flatter- 
ing, even if he was too set in his 
ways to get conceited about it. 
“Take Mrs. Liang back to her 
farm,” he instructed. 

“Yes, professor.” 

“And — ’’ Could he ignore the 
problem for a little while longer? 
No. He had to bring it to a head. 
“ — ask Dr. Faroud to come over 
here, please.” 

“Right away, sir.” The camera- 
man turned to the old lady, offered 
her his arm. She spumed his West- 
ern politeness by tucking her hands 
inside her embroidered sleeves. She 
bowed, he bowed, all three of them 
bowed. Then she followed him back 
to the jeep. 

Small things cranched under Wil- 
lits’ boots as he shifted to face the 
top of the steps. His shadow 
sprawled shapelessly across the un- 
even cement; it was knife-edged 
from the glare of the sun in the 
wide blue sky. 

64 



Why hadn’t the city burned? New 
York, Chicago, St. Louis, San 
Francisco: all were ashy wastelands 
of tumbled masonry and rusting gir- 
derworks. Few cities anywhere in 
the world had been spared. Those 
where governments had still 
functioned during the time of the 
riots had simply postponed their in- 
cineration; the arsonists had re- 
turned later, when there was no one 
to quench their ardor. 

What v/as so special about 
Hsiang-t’an? Peking had gone up; 
so had Shanghai and Canton. The 
mausoleum’s role could be worth 
studying. If it had helped to spare 
this place from the torches, the 
off-world city builders should be 
told of it. They needed every frag- 
ment of knowledge about urban be- 
havior they could get. Evacuation to 
the countryside is not a viable alter- 
native on Mars. 

Behind him, a Matsushita Medi- 
cal Corp. van picked its silent way 
through the piles of debris on the 
square. Its weight alarmed the 
wildlife: birds beat their way up into 
the clean air; rats scampered to 
safer hideouts. Somewhere in the 
twisting alleys a dog barked. 

Willits stooped to peer through 
the windowed door. Faroud was at 
the wheel, his open-necked cotton 
shirt a brilliant d^zle in the other- 
wise dim interior. 

“Why the summons, George?” 
He got out on his side and strolled 
around the front of the van. He was 
short, and sinewy-lean. Impatient 

GALAXY 




intelligence sparked in his Mediter- 
ranean eyes. “Have you found 
something else you can’t deal 
with?” 

Ignore the insult; keep him off 
guard. Straightening, he gestured to 
the granite facade of the building 
above the staircase. “An old lady 
said the mausoleum was up there.” 

“Rather asinine to be looking for 
the Chairman’s body, isn’t it?” 

“It would be if I were, but I’m 
not. Anyway, there are four other 
mausoleums elsewhere in the coun- 
try.” 

“Then — ” 

“Tell me about the health of the 
locals.” Absently, he stroked his 
arm. It felt old, and weary. For a 
moment he envied the other his 
youth. 

Faroud frowned, spread his hand- 
kerchief on a relatively smooth step, 
and sat. With his thumb he pushed 
up the brim of his cap. “The com- 
puter analysis is hardly complete, 
George — after all, we’ve only been 
here a week — and moreover. I’m 
not terribly certain that the histories 
we’ve obtained are quite accurate. 
Illiteracy, among other things, is so 
rampant that — ” 

“So tell me what you know, 
Gemal.” The man would hedge all 
day if you let him. 

“Well.” He twisted the comer of 
his mustache as he thought. “The 
death rate is, of course, absurdly 
high. Quite in line with the predic- 
tions you made in Tokyo,” he 
3dded almost ruefully. “TTiis is at- 

XANADU 



tributable only in part to the 
mdimentaiy health care these peas- 
ants practice — I say, George, they 
not only live like animals, they 
enjoy it! One would suppose 
another factor to be responsible for 
the rest.” 

“Plague?” 

Faroud scratched his ear. 
“You’re obsessed with that, aren’t 
you, George? All I can say is we’ve 
found no evidence of it in the blood 
samples we’ve obtained. And 
yet . .” He spread his hands as 
though appealing to Allah. “And 
yet the rate is too high.” 

Give the man the last benefit of 
the doubt. “Anything else?” 

“If there were, I would have 
mentioned it.” 

Putting his left foot on a higher 
step, he rested his foreanns on his 
bent knee. Except for the birds, the 
city was motionless. There was sun- 
light, and there was wind. The one 
moved too gradually, the other, too 
invisibly. He sensed his kinship 
with the weather-beaten signboards, 
and the few scraps of paint still 
clinging stubbornly to the buildings 
around the square. “I’m afraid, 
Gemal.” 

“Don’t be childish.” His tone 
was contemptuous. “You’ve been 
inoculated against the plague.” 
“That’s not what I’m afraid of, 
although it does bother me that it 
hasn’t died out here.” Maybe the 
arsonists had understood what they 
were doing. A city that’s merely 
deserted echoes with ghostly 

65 




footsteps. You keep expecting the 
shrill blast of a police whistle to 
signal that the daily rhythms should 
be resumed. When the buildings are 
blackened with soot, though, when 
scraggly weeds grow in the wind- 
blown ash, then you know it’s all 
over. “Why is it still cropping 
up?” 

“Re-infection,” shrugged Faroud. 
“These peasants have no concept 
of hygiene.” 

“I don’t buy it.” Stretching, he 
raised his face to the empty sky. 
The sun felt good on his tired skin. 
“Everywhere else, it mutated into 
harmlessness after what, twenty, 
twenty-five years?” 

“You should know, you’re the 
historian.” 

“Well, why not here? It’s been a 
hundred and seventy years since it 
first broke out — why is it still viru- 
lent?” 

“Perhaps it’s not, perhaps it 
merely weakens them to the point 
where something else kills them 
off.” He stood. After retrieving his 
handkerchief, he snapped it in the 
wind, then stuffed it into his hip 
pocket. “But honestly, George — 
who cares? It’s their problem, and I 
say let them worry about it.” 

“/ care, Gemal.” He forced 
down the anger that Faroud’s words 
had awakened. It was infuriating to 
find anti-sinicism in a well-educated 
man, but it couldn’t be dealt with 
on an emotional level. Only reason 
could make Faroud see that the rid- 
dle of China’s vulnerability could 

66 



have overwhelming significance. 
“We need to know why the virus 
never died out.” 

“Random chance,’’ Faroud bit 
off. “Also known as poetic jus- 
tice.” 

iv“Maybe.” He didn’t believe it, 
though. The rest of the world had 
lost a quarter of its population dur- 
ing the plague years, yet had man- 
aged to recover. Even the urbanized 
West and its intricate technology 
had pulled through. Why not 
China? Mao had shaped his society 
to survive anything, up to and in- 
cluding nuclear warfare. He’d de- 
centralized it, made each communal 
village as self-supporting as possi- 
ble. They shouldn’t have been hit 
so hard, unless . “Gemal — ” 

“Yes?” 

He stared at the liver spots on the 
back of his hand. “Why the 
hatred?” 

“Why not? Do you know where 
we’d be if the Chinese hadn’t been 
so damned careless with their CBW 
research? They set us back a 
hundred years.’’ He seemed to 
catch himself, as if he realized that 
he was giving away too much. “I 
do apologize, George. You know 
my feelings about this expedition, 
about how we’re wasting a fortune 
that could be better used somewhere 
else. Tm afraid I let my emotions 
run away with me.” 

“I accept your apology,” said 
Willits stiffly. Until that moment, 
he had been seeking a way to con- 
vince Faroud that the project was 

GALAXY 




worthwhile, but he knew now he 
wouldn’t find one. Like too many 
others, Faroud held a grudge against 
the Chinese, and wanted to see 
them rot in unbroken solitude. 
“Back to the subject,” he said. The 
rest of their discussion would have 
to be held indoors, away from pry- 
ing eyes. “Why did it happen the 
way it did?” 

“You know it’s too soon to an- 
swer that. Wait for the specialists.” 

“Mm.” There were a thousand 
of them scattered across the length 
and breadth of China, examining 
peasants, taping oral histories, dig- 
ging through musty archives 
. exhuming bodies. Each 
would make a report (white copy to 
the sponsoring corporation, green to 
the section leader, canary to the ex- 
pedition leader, pink for personal 
reference), and another batch of 
specialists would sift through them 
in search of the truth. A gigantic 
jig-saw puzzle, paid for by the 
companies that had supplanted the 
old governments. No VP R&D 
wanted a repetition of the Great 
Plague. Things like that wreaked 
havoc with P&L sheets. “It doesn’t 
make sense,” he njuttered. 

“Of course it doesn’t.” At his 
arrogant ease again, Faroud grinned: 
a blaze of white in a field of olive. 
“That’s why solving this problem 
will make us all famous, eh, 
George? Now, unless you want me 
to inspect this mausoleum of yours, 
I have work to do.” 

“Not mine, it’s Mao’s.”

“Of course.” He mounted the 
steps slowly, as if in concession to 
Willits’ years. “What about it so in- 
trigues you — its age? Its ironic 
symbolism? Come, tell me. I’m al- 
ways amused by the way an histo- 
rian views things.” 

“I’m not sure.” He looked up in 
time to see a flight of dirty-grey pi- 
geons burst out of the building. 
“The city wasn’t destroyed, for one 
thing. Was it because of the 
mausoleum? I mean, some sort of 
reversion to ancestor worship? Or is 
there no relation at all?” Dust 
grated beneath his ribbed soles. 
“The old lady told me people used 
to come here pretty regularly, up 
until about ten years ago.” 

“Rather stupid of them to persist 
that long. Why did they stop?” 

“She was a little vague about 
that, but it seems that the building 
wouldn’t let them in any more.” 
Faroud did a double-take. “I beg 
your pardon?’ ’ 

“In the library at Iowa State, I 
found an old article on these 
things.” He nodded to the two- 
story structure that lay before them. 
“There’s a main viewing room — ” 
Faroud’s expression caused him to 
break off and explain: “Pictures and 
memorabilia, but no body.” 

“I see.” 

“Anyway, around the main view- 
ing rooms are meditation rooms. 
Entrance to them is — was — 
regulated by some sort of computer. 
According to the writer, it was very 
democratic: you had to state your 

67 




occupation before the doors would 
open, but if too many people from 
your profession had already used 
the room, you couldn’t enter.” 

“Strange.” 

“Mm.” They were stepping 
through the broad entranceway; the 
marble floor was thickly coated 
with pigeon shit. He wrinkled his 
nose. “Anyway, the only people 
left around here are farmers, and 
the doors won’t open any more.” 

“But they did until ten years 
ago?’ ’ asked Faroud. 

“That’s what she said — oh, 
you’re wondering about the electric- 
ity? Don’t. This place is hooked up 
to that damn solar power plant 
that’s got the engineers so confused. 
You know, the one that should have 
broken down a hundred years ago, 
but didn’t.” 

“I see.” The building was cool, 
and damp. Glass display cases made 
a circular wall in the middle of the 
hall. Dust blanketed them. 

“Gloomy.” 

“One shouldn’t disparage one’s 
metier, George.” 

The ceiling was lost in shadows; 
the walls were stained with rust and 
dirt and dung. Their voices hung in 
the still air like lazy balloons. After 
a moment or two, self- 
consciousness pushed them into 
whisper. It seemed more natural. 

“How can you be at all interested 
in this dingy museum?” asked 
Faroud, exasperated. 

“I’m not, really.” 

“The meditation rooms?” 



“Yes.” He swiveled his head 
until he’d found the staircase. 
“Over there.” 

“What on earth are you looking 
for?” 

“I don’t really know.” That was 
a bare-faced lie. He’d had his mind 
made up for years. He was positive 
he knew what lay behind the 
computer-controlled doors, and all 
he had to do was get past them. But 
his theory wasn’t the kind that 
could have been presented to skep- 
tical scientists, not without proof. It 
wasn’t that they’d have laughed — 
though they would have — it was 
that the sponsoring corporations 
would have retracted their support if 
they’d had any notion of his suspi- 
cions. 

“So what shall we do first?” 

* ★ * 

“First?” He scanned the quota- 
tions engraved in the walls. Some 
were familiar; others had to be 
translated before he could see that 
they were just what he’d been ex- 
pecting. “First,” he said, sighing 
as he dropped all pretense of affa- 
bility, “let’s talk about a dream I 
had.” 

“A dream?” Faroud’s voice was 
as startled as he’d ever heard it. No 
matter how incompetent, it seemed 
to be saying, expedition leaders did 
not mention such things in public. 
“What the devil do you mean, 
George?” 

“I had a dream last night, 
Gemal.” He walked over to a dis- 



68 



GALAXY 




play case, and wiped a spot bare 
with the side of his hand. A faded 
battleflag was dimly visible. “I was 
in a prison cell, shackled to the 
wall. I couldn’t move. My enemies 
were suffocating me, and I didn’t 
know why. While they were stuf- 
fing my mouth with cotton, good 
fluffy Egyptian cotton, they were 
doing something to my arm. I 
didn’t understand that, either.” 

“Are you hoping that I’ll play 
Joseph to your Pharaoh? Because if 
so — ” 

“Not at all, Gemal,” He turned, 
and with almost an apologetic air 
showed the other the small auto- 
matic he was holding. “I’d like to 
know,” he said softly, “what you 
injected me with.” 

“George, are you — ” 

Like clouds moving away from 
the sun, the fingers of his other 
hand parted. In the palm of his 
hand glittered a gold cufflink. “It’s 
yours, Gemal. I found it in my 
sleeping bag. And I’ve noticed your 
habit of rolling your sleeves before 
giving a shot. Now, will you tell 
me?” 

“You’re mad! Why should I — ” 
“I’d like to know that, too.” The 
muzzle of the gun was steady. 
“You have five seconds. Four. 
Three. T — ” 

“Wait.” He gulped, and wiped 
the sudden sweat off his forehead. 
His eyes, bleak obsidian, swept the 
room quickly, back and forth, 
searching for an exit. There was 
only the one. “I did do it.”

“What was it?’’ 

“A — a flu virus. Nothing serious. 
Just something to, ah, put you out 
of action for a while, don’t you 
know?’’ Dark stains were spreading 
under the arms of his shirt. 

“Why?” 

Faroud’s jaw stiffened; he 
breathed rapidly for a long minute. 
A flush — of embarrassment? of 
anger? — rose in his neck and 
cheeks. “You’re old, George,” he 
said at last. “Too old. This is a job 
for a younger man.” 

“You mean like yourself?” 

“Yes, like me, if you will. After 
all, you’re not even a doctor — 
you’re what, a history teacher? An 
amateur archeologist? You’re un- 
qualified to conduct this expedition. 
And then your ideas — my God, 
man, you’ve not changed them in 
decades! They’ve become as fos- 
silized as those idiotic dinosaur 
tracks you keep looking for.” 

“I see.” An old story. The 
youthful deputy, impatient for more 
renown, in disagreement with his 
superior . and well aware of how 
many years would pass before he 
could legitimately succeed to the 
throne. “So you thought that if I 
got sick, you’d take over as Acting 
Director, and impress hell out of the 
sponsors, right? And then they’d 
give you money for your own pet 
projects.” 

“Precisely.” 

Faroud was still trying to lie. A 
case of flu would put him in bed for 
a couple weeks, but hardly incapaci- 

70 



tate him. The expedition, moreover, 
was open-ended: it would stay in 
the field until the sponsors had no 
more questions it could answer. It 
wasn’t harmless flu virus coursing 
through his veins. Not a chance. 

He wondered how long he’d 
have. If it was plague, as he more 
than half suspected, the inoculation 
he’d gotten in the States would give 
him some protection, though possi- 
bly not enough to survive the dis- 
ease’s complications. If it was 
something else — and Faroud, as 
Chief Medical Officer of the expedi- 
tion could have gotten his hands on 
almost any type of virus ... his 
stomach twisted; Faroud himself 
had given him his inoculation. And 
the Egyptian was one who believed 
in long-term planning. 

The hell of it was, he could sym- 
pathize. Faroud was a research 
physician, not a historian. It was 
natural that he’d be most interested 
in physical diseases which his disci- 
pline hadn’t conquered yet. The 
problem was that Willits was on the 
trail of another, subtler afflic- 
tion . one that Faroud wouldn’t 
recognize. Maybe he couldn't rec- 
ognize it. Maybe he was too close 
to it. 

Ironic. If Faroud hadn’t launched 
his little palace revolution, Willits 
would have had time to go about 
his investigations properly. Now it 
was too late for SOP; he had to 
rush things along so that he could 
prove his point in the weeks — 
days? — left to him. Another irony: 

GALAXY 




Faroud would get his fame, but 
only because he’d be evidence. 

Dammit, why didn’t more people 
care about the truth? They were 
ready to assign blame, and to 
squeeze out their petty revenge, be- 
fore they knew at whom the finger 
should be pointed. They didn’t even 
want to know the true nature of the 
crime, and that was dangerous. 

Mankind was back on its feet, 
and plunging into its technological 
future, but it didn’t have the self- 
knowledge that it needed. Yet with- 
out that, understanding is impossi- 
ble. Every perception is distorted by 
the prisms of our assumptions, and 
it behooves us to know the angles 
of refraction. 

If you don’t want to know what 
man has done, you can hardly pro- 
tect yourself from what he might 
do. 

“Let’s go upstairs,’’ he said, mo- 
tioning with the gun. 

“Why? Faroud looked ready to 
refuse. 

“I’m going because I’d like to 
satisfy my curiosity,” he replied. 
“You’re going because I’ll gutshoot 
you if you don’t.” 

“George!” He did his best to ap- 
pear shocked by such ruthlessness. 

“Move.” 

Faroud obeyed. Willits stayed 
five paces behind him, the gun 
leveled at his sweat-stained back. 
Halfway up the stairs, he started 
speaking: 

“You’re not the first to feel 
stymied by old fogeys. The man 

IN XANADU 



who built this place would have had 
a lot of sympathy for you. He spent 
the last thirty years of his life trying 
to solve the problem.” 

“Mao?” 

His tone was one of disbelief; he 
even ventured to glance back over 
his shoulder to see if his captor was 
serious. “But he was an old 
fogey.” 

“To you, yes, and possibly to 
some in his bureaucracy. To him- 
self, though, he was the steward of 
perpetual revolution — look at his 
reign. As soon as one of his heirs got 
comfortable, he was ousted, and a 
new man brought in so the process 
could begin again. Do you read 
Chinese?’ ’ 

“No.” Left unasked was the 
question. Why are you wasting my 
time? 

“Too bad. You would have en- 
joyed some of the quotations in the 
lobby. ‘Guard against arrogance.’ 
‘Commandism is wrong in any type 
of work.’ ‘We must never relax our 
vigilance.’ ‘It is necessary to carry 
on constant and arduous socialist 
revolutionary struggles.’ And the 
one up here — ” his eyes went to the 
huge characters carved into the wall 
“ — ‘Where the broom does not 
reach, the dust will not vanish of 
itself.’ Qever.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“This whole building, Gemal, is 
a monument to one man’s impa- 
tience with a ponderous, entrenched 
bureaucracy. He knew what would 
happen, once he was gone and 

71 




couldn’t keep things stirred up. He 
built this, and four others just like 
it, to make sure all his people 
would remain good little rev- 
olutionaries.” He pointed to a 
door. Set in the wall beside it was 
a speaker and a microphone. “Let’s 
try this one here.” 

“George.” Faroud cleared his 
throat, and fought for self-control. 
Ease and elegance reappeared on his 
face, only slightly belied by his 
nervous eyes. “I say, George, the 
flu must have taken hold. You’re 
babbling, man!” 

“Uh-uh.” He came forward. 
“Step up to that door.” 

“And then?” 

“When it opens, you go in. 
You’ll have a chat with the 
Chairman himself, courtesy of some 
marvelous computers and a power 
plant that should have failed a 
hundred years ago. Too bad you 
don’t speak Chinese.” 

“But why?” He moved closer to 
the steel-clad door anyway. 

A new voice entered the quarrel, 
one crackly with years of accumu- 
lated static. “What is your occupa- 
tion, comrade?” it asked in 
Chinese. 

“I am a cadre,” Willits answered, 
silencing Faroud with a glance. 

“Then enter.” The door slid 
back; stale dry air blew out of the 
darkness. The doctor hesitated. 

“Get in there,” he commanded. 

“George—” 

“Now!” His trigger finger tight- 
ened visibly. 

72 



“All right.” 

The door hissed shut behind him. 
Faintly, Willits could hear that the 
hissing continued even after the 
door had shut ... it was gentler 
than it had any right to be. 

The gun clattered to the floor. 
Willits looked at it, and saw where 
their footsteps had disturbed the 
grime. Underneath, the marble was 
worn. Thousands of feet had passed 
through that corridor in the years 
before something went wrong. 

“I’m right, aren’t I?” he asked 
softly. The huge oil portrait of the 
Chairman lay still beneath its dust. 
“Something went wrong. Not even 
you could have wanted it to be that 
lethal. What were you hoping for? 
A one-percent rise in the death rate? 
Two?” He kicked the gun; as it 
skidded down the corridor, it laid 
bare a streak of delicate rose. “YoO 
just wanted a little more ferment in 
the bureaucracy, didn’t you? But 
something must have mutated, and 
the bureaucrat who was running this 
place didn’t notice. Helluva thing. 
You thought the whole problem was 
that people wouldn’t give up their 
positions or their power ... so in- 
stead of creating more, you decided 
to take it from them.” 

He went to get the gun. He’d 
need it for restraining Faroud until 
the two of them could be quaran- 
tined and decontaminated. 

There was a mottled white crust 
over everything, and it crackled 
under his feet like powdered 
glass. ★

CRASHING NEUTRON STARS, 

MINI BLACK HOLES AND SPACEDRIVES 



The universe is a queer place. I 
know that doesn’t surprise my read- 
ers, so this month let’s look at some 
far-out theories before the relentless 
march of science catches up and 
converts them into (yawn) just more 
engineering. 

There’s also a point to be made. 
At least once a week I get a new 
“theory” from one of my readers. 
Sometimes it’s blueprints for a de- 
vice that gives out more energy than 
it takes in, sometimes it’s a refuta- 
tion of Einstein, sometimes some- 
thing else, but in nearly every case 
there’s a common factor: the cover 
letter says no one will listen, and 
I’m the inventor’s last resort. Gen- 
erally, too. I’m asked “Why won’t 
they listen?”, but the question is 
rhetorical; the~next paragraph tells 
me that orthodox scientists do not 
have open minds, are afraid of new 
ideas, etc., etc. 

There’s a little truth to that, but 
not so much as is often supposed. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Orthodox science can get pretty far 
out, as we’ll see in a moment. 

Everyone knows what a neutron 
star is, right? It’s a sort of inter- 
mediary superheavy object: that is, 
squeeze atoms hard enough but not 
too hard and they’ll form a super- 
dense goop. Everything has been 
shoved together, but it’s still ordi- 
nary matter. That’s what dwarf stars 
are made of. 

Squeeze more and the atoms 
can’t stand it. The electrons are 
forced out of their orbits and down 
into the nucleus. When you push an 
electron hard into a proton you get 
a neutron, and a sufficiently 
squeezed object will be nothing but 
neutrons, ie, a neutron star. 

Finally we can continue squeez- 
ing (the “easy” way is to pump 
more and more matter onto a neu- 
tron star and let gravitational col- 
lapse do the work) and the very 
neutrons can’t stand it; they’re 
squeezed right out of the universe. 

73 



Well, maybe not: but the result is a 
black hole, an object whose surface 
gravity is greater than the speed of 
light so that it can never be ob- 
served, and that’s a very queer 
thing indeed. For further details 
consult some of my previous col- 
umns, or there are any number of 
recent books. 

Surely those theories are far out? 
And for a very long time they were 
pure theory. Back in the 30’s J. 
Robert Oppenheimer deduced the 
possibility of neutron stars from an 
analysis of Einstein’s work on 
gravitation. He also noted (as had 
others) the possibility of black 
holes. He published these specula- 
tions. No one laughed. He wasn’t 
thrown out of the union. Why? 
Why did “they” listen to him, but 
“they” won’t pay attention to out- 
siders? 

Well, of course there is a certain 
degree of old-boy net working here; 
obviously you pay more attention to 
people you know or have heard of 
than people you don’t know and 
who don’t seem to have any qualifi- 
cations; but that’s not the whole of 
it by a long shot. Neutron stars and 
black holes were far out and queer 
indeed — but they did not challenge 
basic physics. Quite the contrary: 
they were deduced from accepted 
ideas. 

Meanwhile, back in the obser- 
vatories, the radio astronomers 
came up with a queer result: pul- 
sars. These were very small objects 
which emitted quite a lot of energy 

74 



at fantastically regular intervals on 
the order of a second. They were 
entirely unexpected: no theory pre- 
dicted them, no theory accounted 
for them, yet they had to be ex- 
plained. And of course explained 
they were, because it’s easy to 
show that neutron stars will rotate 
very rapidly; they can send out 
bursts of radio energy, and even 
better, they’ll be slowing down 
(very slightly) all the time. Back to 
the observatory to discover that the 
pulsars were slowing down at just 
the right rate (micro-seconds a year) 
and lo, Oppenheimer’s far-out 
theory becomes universally accept- 
able. 

That took care of neutron stars: 
and if those probably existed, then 
why not black holes? Thus the sud- 
den interest in holes. 

Now there are several ways we 
can create black holes. The simplest 
is for a properly-sized star to “go 
out”: that is, the star runs out of 
fuel and begins to collapse from 
simple gravitational attraction. Of 
course the collapsing process will 
itself produce heat for quite a long 
time, and that brings us to another 
far-out theory: has the Sun, our 
Sun, “gone out”? 

It may have. If it had we 
wouldn’t notice, because it would 
only have to shrink a few kilome- 
ters a year to give off the energy it 
does. (Gravitational potential energy 
is powerful stuff.) Moreover, the 
continued collapse would eventually 
cause it to re-ignite, halting the col- 

GALAXY 




lapse. There are a very few theorists 
who seriously propose this alterna- 
tion between collapse and 
hydrogen-burning as an explanation 
for Earth’s Ice Ages. The theory is 
not widely held, but those who pro- 
pose it aren’t laughed at. Why not? 

Well, first, the Ice Ages are real, 
and we don’t have a convincing 
mechanism to explain them. Sec- 
ond, out in the old Homestake 
Mine, deep underground, they’re 
searching for solar neutrinos — and 
they can’t find them. If the Sun is 
truly burning hydrogen, there ought 
to be a lot of neutrinos, and there’s 
no good reason to doubt that the 
Homestake apparatus would trap 
them — so where are they? The 
“Sun’s gone out’’ theory does ex- 
plain an experimental result. 

Leaving that particular theory 
let’s get back to black holes. There 
are other ways they might be 
formed. One would be to focus a 
laser small enough. After all, e 
equals mc-squared works both 
ways: if matter can become energy, 
energy can become matter, and thus 
a sufficient energy density would 
make a black hole. There’d be no 
way to tell it from other holes, 
either. This is not a very practical 
way to get black holes. 

Finally, we can make black holes 
by having really humungous pres- 
sures. Stephen Hawking of Cam- 
bridge first postulated the idea of 
mini-black-holes, little tiny things 
massing from a few to a few mil- 
lion kilograms; previous to Hawk- 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



ing’s work nobody contemplated a 
black hole smaller than stellar size. 

Hawking thought that mini black 
holes had been formed during the 
Big Bang, when there were cer- 
tainly sufficient pressures for creat- 
ing them. Since it was then thought 
that black holes never go away once 
formed, we could expect in a few 
decades to go looking for primordial 
black holes in the asteroid belt. 

Matter of fact, my friend Larry 
Niven won a Hugo for a mini-hole 
story. (“The Hole Man’’.) How- 
ever, having created mini-holes. 
Hawking then proceeded to des- 
troy them. He applied quantum 
mechanics to black holes and dem- 
onstrated that the things aren’t sta- 
ble. Black holes evaporate, small 
ones doing so rather quickly and 
quite violently. For details on that, 
see this column in the January 1975 
Galaxy. I’m particularly proud 
of that column because it was the 
first popular-press publication of 
Hawking’s evaporation theory; now 
his view is universally accepted. 

The upshot was that holes mas- 
sing less than 10'® grams when 
formed during the Big Bang are all 
gone now, and any larger holes 
formed then (and now getting down 
to small size) will vanish spectacu- 
larly with much high-temperature 
radiation. Consequently, we needn’t 
bother looking for small black 
holes. 

Well, guess what? Mini-holes are 
back again. Kenneth Jacobs and 
Patrick Seitzer have just published a 



75 




prize-winning essay submitted to the 
Gravity Research Foundation (for a 
copy of their paper send a couple of 
dollars to the GRF at 58 Middle 
St., Gloucester, Mass 01930) enti- 
tled “Mini Black Holes Are Form- 
ing Now.” According to Jacobs and 
Seitzer the little holes are generated 
inside neutron stars. 

It works this way. Take one 
common or garden variety neutron 
star. Pile matter on it. You can do 
that by putting the star in a dusty 
region of the Galaxy, or by giving 
it a normal-matter companion in 
close orbit: the companion loses 
mass to the neutron star. 

As the neutron star grows, a 
“pressure and density spike” de- 
velops in the interior. If you keep 
piling on enough matter the neutron 
star will simply collapse into a large 
black hole, but let’s consider a time 
just prior to that: a time when the 
interior of the neutron star is far 
denser than its surface. 

Jacobs and Seitzer offer 
mathematical proof that it’s at least 
possible that the interior collapses 
into a mini-hole, leaving the rest of 
the neutron star intact! 

Once the mini-hole is formed, it 
begins to evaporate. On the other 
hand, it’s inside a neutron star, sur- 
rounded by all that lovely dense 
matter, and it can begin to feed. By 
eating neutrons the hole grows 
larger. Thus we have two coun- 
teracting tendencies: the hole eats 
the star, growing larger, and also 
undergoes Hawking “evaporation”. 

76 



Under certain conditions the two 
may just balance each other. It’s 
even possible that the tiny hole will 
prevent the formation of a big black 
hole, thus giving the neutron star a 
few billion years more of normal 
life. 

Sigh. It’s hard to see how those 
holes can be useful. There are all 
kinds of marvelous things you can 
do with a mini-hole if you can get 
at one, but the interior of a neutron 
star is a well-protected place; na- 
ture’s safe deposit box. Back in the 
old days before Hawking evapora- 
tion, we thought mini-holes might 
come to rest inside asteroids, and it 
would be no great trick to go move 
the asteroid to get at the hole; but 
doing that to a neutron star would 
be a bit more difficult. 

It would also be dangerous. The 
hole exists in equilibrium, eating 
the star at a rate to balance its 
evaporation. Disturb that and the 
entire neutron star could become a 
black hole in milli-seconds! It 
would also toss out a bit of energy: 
10®* ergs. (For comparison, our Sun 
puts out 10®* ergs each year, and an 
ordinary nova gives off 10'*^ ergs.) 

In fact, Jacobs and Seitzer de- 
scribe ways these mini-holes might 
be the driving mechanism for 
super-novae. They also speculate 
that this could be a mechanism to 
explain gamma-ray bursts, and here 
we leave the realm of theory to re- 
turn to the feal universe. Gamma- 
ray bursts exist, and their spectra 
are consistent with events predicted 

GALAXY 




by the Jacobs and Seitzer mini-hole 
theory. 

Now that gets interesting. As 
MIT’s Phillip Morrison put it re- 
cently, x-ray astronomy strives for 
predictive power, but so far is more 
like social science than physics: we 
can find ways to explain observa- 
tions, but not predict them. Of 
course Jacobs and Seitzer haven’t 
made a prediction either, since they 
knew of the x-ray bursts before they 
devised their mini-hole theory; still 
in all, they’ve as good an explana- 
tion as anyone. 

Those x-ray events are bother- 
some. They’re also hard to study, 
because of the atmosphere. Of 
course that’s fortunate: if we could 
directly observe those x-rays com- 
ing from space, we’d none of us be 
here. Our atmosphere lets ordinary 
light squeak through with 20% at- 
tenuation, but it stops x-rays cold, 
and that’s just as well for us, but 
bad for astronomers. Thus it’s only 
since we began sending up satellites 
that we learned of x-ray events, and 
we still don’t know much about 
them. 

What we do know is driving as- 
trophysicists nuts. Astronomy, after 
all, is usually concerned with rather 
slow and stately phenomena, and 
highly repetitive events, such as or- 
bits. Things aren’t supposed to 
change very fast. Now suddenly 
we’re confronted with rapid x-ray 
events, and to make it worse we 
can’t focus the x-ray satellite “tele- 
scopes” very well, so we can’t 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



even be sure of where the x-ray 
bursts are coming from. However, 
the Dutch astronomical satellite has 
a rather small field, and happens to 
point in a good direction, and it 
says that a probable source of x-ray 
bursts is globular clusters. And 
that’s weird. 

Globular clusters: big balls of 
very old stars. About 200,000 stars 
to the ball, packed very close with 
average inter-stellar distances of 
light-months. There are a number of 
such clusters hanging about the 
galaxy in a kind of halo. Being very 
old stars they ought to be stable, 
without too many strange things 
happening; but here are these x-ray 
bursts. 

The bursts themselves look like a 
spike of energy, then a slow decay. 
Typical: every AVi hours the x-ray 
energy goes from essentially none 
to a lot in about 0.1 second, the 
event lasts at peak for about 10 sec- 
onds, and then decays over a period 
of hundreds of seconds. That needs 
explanation. 

Possibly the Jacobs-Seitzer theory 
will cover the facts. There are other 
theories, very far-out, weird in fact, 
probably wrong, but really beauti- 
ful. Take, for example, crashing 
neutron stars. 

Imagine a rather floppy disk of 
gaseous matter orbiting a star like 
the rings of Saturn. Put this whole 
mess into a globular cluster. The 
disk probably isn’t that hard to 
come by in there: globular clusters 
act as gravitational traps, and might 

77 




easily accumulate all kinds of cos- 
mic junk, including the debris of 
old stars, etc. 

Now imagine a neutron star in an 
orbit tilted with respect to the plane 
of the floppy disk. Every half-orbit 
the neutron star crashes through the 
disk, produeing x-ray bursts. A 
lovely idea. 

Alas, it’s almost certainly wrong: 
there are many sources of x-ray 
bursts, and it’s just hard to believe 
that anything as unlikely as erashing 
neutron stars are common, even in 
our queer universe. 

Let’s try another theory: flash- 
burning. Take one neutron star. Let 
hydrogen fall on it. The hydrogen 
accumulates on the surface, slowly 
building up until the neutron star 
has an “atmosphere” a few mil- 
limeters thick. The density increases 
sharply until it hits the critical 
point, and bang! Every few hours 
there’s a hydrogen bomb enveloping 
the neutron star. 

Far out, right? Yet those theories 
were described at a meeting of the 
super-orthodox A A AS. Now let’s 
look at some “neglected” theory. 

★ ★ * 

Dean Drive: science fiction read- 
ers must know about that. Norman 
Dean was a crackpot inventor. 
Many years ago he built a gadget. 
(He also took out a patent; on that, 
more later.) Dean claimed some- 
thing that sounds very reasonable, 
hardly far out at all: that his 

78 



mechanism “converts rotary accel- 
eration into linear acceleration.” 
After all, a rotating object does 
have acceleration, right? Accelera- 
tion is acceleration, right? Thus to 
convert from one to the other vio- 
lates no conservation laws. 

Now that’s an attractive concept. 
Take an electric motor (Dean used 
an ordinary quarter-inch electric 
drill) as the source of rotary accel- 
eration; hook it up to the Dean 
mechanism; and lo, you have a 
spacedrive. Very attractive, because 
by installing a Dean Machine in a 
nuclear submarine we’d have a 
spaceship already built! 

Now Dean did build a machine. 
It did not lift itself off the floor. 
Observers agree on that much — and 
that’s about all they do agree on. 
The machine shook and shimmied 
and jumped up and down, and there 
was a famous photograph of Dave 
Garroway shoving a piece of paper 
under the machine. Also, John W. 
Campbell Jr. reported that he’d seen 
the apparent weight of the Dean 
Machine, as measured on a bath- 
room scale, appreciably decrease 
when the gizmo was turned on, to 
be restored when it was switched 
off. G. Harry Stine reports that he 
felt the machine push against his 
hand; push hard, and when it was 
turned off the push wasn’t there. 

Unfortunately, that’s about the 
sum total of observational evidence. 
Dean never let his machine be 
examined by anyone else. However, 
the story doesn’t quite end there. 

GALAXY 




Not long ago Harry Stine pub- 
lished an article about the Dean 
Drive in that Other Magazine (the 
one with rivets). Robert Prehoda 
(DESIGNING THE FUTURE; Chil- 
ton, 1967, among other excellent 
books) and I were discussing 
Harry’s article (Harry is an old 
friend of Prehoda’ s) and it came out 
that Bob Prehoda had tried to buy 
the Dean Drive back in the early 
60’s. At the time Bob was repre- 
senting the Rockefeller family, so 
the ability to pay real folding 
money wasn’t in question. I knew 
of a couple of other aerospace firms 
who’d also made the effort. The 
stories were remarkably similar; 
Dean wouldn’t let anyone examine 
the machine. He wanted a million 
dollars and a Nobel prize up front: 
then you could play with the 
gadget. No one was going to put up 
that kind of money without seeing 
the gizmo in operation. There are 
just too many ways the reported re- 
sults could be obtained without any- 
thing new. For example, if you 
jump up and down on your bath- 
room scale at just the right frequen- 
cies, you can fool the scale into 
thinking you’re either lighter or 
heavier than you are; its response 
time just can’t handle that non- 
steady weight. 

Prehoda had also known Dr. Wil- 
liam Davis, USAF colonel and suc- 
cessful inventor, who had worked 
out a physics theory which, sup- 
posedly, allows the Dean Drive and 
other “reactionless” drives to work.

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



79 



Willy “Spacedrive” Davis spent a 
lot of time promoting what came to 
be called “Davis mechanics”, and 
although his practical work made 
him a good bit of money, he ac- 
quired an unenviable reputation 
among theoreticians. Harry Stine 
worked for Davis and built several 
gadgets supposed to test the Davis 
theories. 

Davis is dead. Norman Dean is 
dead. John W. Campbell is dead. 
And neither Prehoda nor I could get 
out of the back of our minds a sim- 
ple fact: Gregor Mendel discovered 
genetics but the results lay unused 
from 1868 to 1900 because no one 
wanted to listen to this crazy abbott. 
Could something similar be happen- 
ing here? 

We doubted it, but it did seem 
reasonable to try to get all the data 
together in one place before ev- 
erybody who actually saw the Dean 
Machine, or tested Davis’s theories, 
went off to Murphy’s Hall. We de- 
cided to invite Harry to Los 
Angeles to confer with some other 
people on how best to test this 
whole concept once and for all. 
Understand: none of us, not one, 
really “believes” in spacedrives; 
but the concept is so blasted impor- 
tant and the consequences are so 
far-reaching, that surely it’s worth a 
little effort? 

So who do you invite to such a 
conference? What’s needed are 
people with minds that are “open”, 
but not minds pierced with gaping 
holes; with enough knowledge of 

80 



physics and math to follow the ar- 
guments; and enough scientific in- 
tegrity neither to bite on the idea 
simply because it’s unorthodox nor 
to reject it for that reason. 

We ended up with: Robert Pre- 
hoda, chemist and propulsion sys- 
tems expert; Larry Niven; Dan Al- 
derson, astronomer and computer 
scientist; Robert Forward, physicist 
and gravitation expert; G. Harry 
Stine, engineer and gadgeteer ex- 
traordinary; and myself. It was an 
interesting lunch. Something may 
come of it. And the result illustrates 
precisely the point of this column. 

The general reaction was simple. 
Davis’s theoretical papers are in- 
teresting, but not terribly valuable. 
They assert that there’s something 
wrong with physics. Okay, and 
maybe there is; but contemporary 
physical theory has a lot of scalps 
hanging from its belt. Maybe it 
needs changing, but not without 
some convincing evidence; and 
mathematical theories are not evi- 
dence. 

That’s what I’ve found very hard 
to get across to people. In order for 
a ‘‘Dean Drive” or the gizmos 
postulated by “Davis mechanics” 
to work we really do have to throw 
out a very great deal of very fun- 
damental physical theory. You can- 
not simply “convert rotary accelera- 
tion into linear thrust” and remain 
consistent with what we think we 
know. Spacedrives are Just impossi- 
ble given current theory. If you 
want to move a ship in inertial 

GALAXY 




space, you have got to throw reac- 
tion mass out the back end, and 
that’s all there is to it. 

Now, sure, theory can be wrong. 
Einstein did his thing, and Newto- 
nian physics has never been the 
same. We’ve yet to come to the end 
of the changes wrought by quantum 
mechanics. Moreover, what with 
100 and more elementary particles 
kicking around, many believe that 
physics is due for a restructuring 
along the order of the changes rung 
in by Einstein. 

But note: Einstein didn’t generate 
his theory out of pure math. Far 
from it. His contributions came in 
explanation of observed phenomena 
that simply couldn’t be explained by 
Newtonian concepts. The change in 
the perihelion of Mercury; the 
photo-electric effect; the 
Michaelson-Morely experiment; all 
these said, loudly, that there was 
something wrong with physics and 
it was time to get up a new theory. 

Davis, on the other hand, played 
about with math and came up with 
“predictions” absolutely impossible 
within present physical theory. Is 
there any wonder that no one takes 
them seriously? Now a working 
“Dean Machine” would change all 
that. If you can actually build a 
gizmo that produces thrust without 
throwing mass overboard — even a 
tiny thrust — then there’s nothing for 
it: physics is in trouble, and new 
theory must be found. Without such 
evidence, though, there’s simply no 
reason to revise physics theory. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



After all, the “orthodox” stuff 
works quite well. It fits the ob- 
served universe. 

Now: there remains Harry Stine’s 
memory, after all these years, of 
that machine pushing against his 
hand. One result of our conference 
was a consensus that if the Dean 
Machine did not work, it at least 
did not employ any of the common 
means of producing spurious re- 
sults. It didn’t have feet that period- 
ically touched the floor, and such 
like. That doesn’t mean it worked 
the way Dean said; it just means we 
don’t know how the result was ob- 
tained. 

Then too, when Harry Stine was 
working for William Davis, Stine 
built a couple of gadgets (see 
Harry’s Analog article for de- 
tails) that gave results you certainly 
wouldn’t have predicted in advance. 
They may be explainable in “nor- 
mal” theory, but they are a bit 
queer, and they do fit Willy Davis’s 
theories. 

The upshot of our meeting was 
this: the theoretical stuff can wait. 
What’s important is that Harry 
Stine, as one of the few men now 
alive who actually saw the Dean 
Machine and also worked with ex- 
perimental gadgetry to test Davis 
mechanics, get his experimental re- 
sults into proper form and publish 
them. That’s what’s important. Evi- 
dence. As Bob Forward observed, 
once the plans are published, one of 
these days a research physicist will 
build the apparatus: and if several 

81 




different labs get the results Harry 
did, and have no conventional ex- 
planation for them, then it will be 
time to trot out the theories. “One 
good experimental result is worth a 
thousand theories,’’ Forward said; 
and he’s right. 

Back in the old days a number of 
us built Dean Machines from the 
patent specifications. We had tech- 
nicians and they had to be paid be- 
tween jobs; might as well use them 
to test new ideas. None of the giz- 
mos worked. I now know of four 
that were built. Harry Stine can ex- 
plain that: Dean, being, uh, highly 
suspicious, didn’t describe his ac- 
tual gadget in the patent. Of course 
that’s stupid, because a patent pro- 
tects only what’s disclosed, but it’s 
very much in keeping with what’s 
known about Dean’s personality. 

Harry says the actual Dean 
Machine was the goldamdest collec- 
tion of springs and slipclutches and 
mechanical linkages he’s ever seen 
in his life. He also says it pushed 
hard against his hand, and he’ll 
never forget that. Harry thinks Dean 
had something. The question is, can 
it be reproduced? Did it “work” as 
Dean thought, or did it merely act 
strangely? There are ways to test 
that, unambiguously. Until that’s 
done, though, theory isn’t relevant. 

So it’s that simple. It isn’t that 
the “establishment” won’t listen, as 
so many would-be theorists insist; 
it’s that the newcomers insist that 
physicists only listen. They have 
nothing to show. 

82 



Now I get all kinds of blueprints 
and plans and equations from my 
readers. Those who send them as- 
sume, I hope rightfully, that (1) I 
know something of what science 
and technology is all about, and (2) 

I try to keep an open mind. I’m'wp 
willing to listen. 

But please, all of you who have 
new ideas, keep in mind what I said 
earlier. If you have plans for a per- 
petual motion machine and you re- 
ally believe it will work — why, build 
it! Don’t send out plans only and 
then complain that “nobody listens”. 

Of course nobody listens; it takes a 
lot of effort to spot the flaw in a 
very complex device (one I was 
sent ran to fifteen pages of draw- 
ings) but the chances are good that 
the flaw is there. I don’t care how 
good a theory you have to prove 
that you can get energy out of your 
swimming pool; but I care a lot if 
you have built the device and it 
works. 

Experimental results. Build the 
device. Make it work. And then if 
nobody listens, something can be 
done. Certainly “orthodox” physics 
doesn’t know everything. I’ve said 
myself that I believe (emotional bias 
only; I have no hard evidence for 
this) that we’ll someday build 
faster-than-light ships, and yes, I 
suspect there might even be 
“spacedrives. ” 

But we won’t find them from 
blueprints. It takes evidence. Once 
you’ve got that, you’ll find plenty 
of people to listen. ★ 



GALAXY 











lack Williainao 




An impossible object appears at 
the fringes of our galaxy, looming 
out of unknown space at a sixth the 
speed of light. The size of a giant 
star, it seems incredibly solid, not 
gaseous, and cool as a planet. Yet 
it’s far too light to be a mass of any 
possible substance. Any really solid 
object of its size would be sucked 
into a black hole by its own gravita- 
tion. Baffled by its riddles, the 
galactic observers call it Cuckoo. 

It’s a Dyson sphere, designed for 
the science fiction trilogy I’m now 
writing with Fred Pohl. Outside 
such fiction, Dyson spheres still be- 
long to theory, as did positrons and 
neutrinos not long ago. Yet there are 
exciting reasons to believe they 
should exist. Though no actual ob- 
servations have been confirmed, 
they’re open for imaginative explo- 
ration. 

Such probing of possible alterna- 
tive worlds is half the fun of sci- 
ence fiction — perhaps more than 
half for the writer. Yet even so, too 
few writers venture as boldly as 
they might. Too often we’re simply 
informed that the new planet Just 
happens to be oddly Earthlike, hap- 
pily provided with breathable air 
and a friendly biochemistry. 

The universe offers probable 
worlds enough awaiting exploration, 
actual or imagined. Our own galaxy 
holds perhaps a hundred billion 
suns, and there’s accumulating evi- 
dence that a family of planets is 
formed with every normal star. 
Most of them, however, will offer 



our spacemen a pretty grim wel- 
come. 

We Earthfolk inhabit a pretty li- 
mited ecological niche. In the scale 
of cosmic temperatures, ranging 
from the absolute zero outside the 
galaxies to the hundreds of millions 
of degrees inside the stars, our sort 
of life is confined to the narrow 
zone where water is commonly 
liquid. In our own planetary family. 
Mars is now too cold, Venus far 
too hot. 

We require free oxygen, which is 
thermodynamically unstable and 
therefore probably rare — our own 
supply is here only because the 
chlorophyl in plants releases it fast- 
er than it can combine again. We 
can only suppose, or hope, that 
other worlds will evolve equally 
helpful plants. 

We require a sheltered environ- 
ment, permanently protected from 
all sorts of common cosmic 
extremes — from the deadly gases in 
other planetary atmospheres, from 
the energetic ions around Jupiter, 
from the meteors that once bom- 
barded the moon. 

Our own Earth is an unlikely 
place, though precisely how un- 
likely we can’t yet say. One star in 
a hundred may have a planet where 
we could feel at home, or one in 
ten thousand. The odds are still un- 
known, but most worlds are going 
to be different. 

A few science fiction writers 
have become specialists in exotic 
planets. Notably Hal Clement, who 



84 



GALAXY 




has created big worlds and strange 
worlds, hot worlds and cold ones. 
Both he and Poul Anderson have 
written illuminating chapters on the 
invention of new planets and new 
forms of life for Bretnor’s Science 
Fiction: Today and Tomorrow. 

Often, of course, the writer is 
more intent on biological and social 
extrapolations than on new 
geologies. Ursula Le Guin’s planet 
Winter in Left Hand of Darkness is 
about what Earth might have been 
at the peak of the last ice age; the 
absorbing innovations are in her 
people and their culture. 

But the problems of building 
physically different environments 
does offer a stimulating mental chal- 
lenge and a widened scope for all 
sorts of story development. The 
Dyson sphere that Fred and I have 
been designing for our new trilogy 
is I think the largest habitable world 
in all science fiction. 

Freeman Dyson is a mathemati- 
cian at the Institute for Advanced 
Study. He has suggested that our 
neighbor civilizations might be ob- 
servable in space as points of in- 
frared radiation, because a really 
advanced people might be able to 
trap and use all the radiation shining 
in every direction from their sun, al- 
lowing only waste heat to escape. 

The simplest way of doing this 
would be to build all the metal of 
the planets into a swarm of sun- 
vaned spacecraft, moving in orbits 
that keep them spread in a cloud all 
around their sun. I have suggested 

DESIGNING A DYSON SPHERE 



this sort of thing in a novel called 
The Power of Blackness , but for the 
trilogy we wanted a solid wall 
around the star. 

(Larry Niven took one step in this 
direction with Ring World. His in- 
vention is an immense metal ring 
spinning around a sun, so fast that 
its air and its inhabitants are held 
against the inner surface by cen- 
trifugal force. To make the ring, he 
requires a very remarkable metal.) 

Our own first problem was build- 
ing material for the sphere. Most of 
the Universe is hydrogen. The 
heavy metals, formed only in 
supernova explosions, are relatively 
rare. At best, the stuff of any ordi- 
nary planetary system would be 
enough to make only a flimsy sphere. 

But ours was to be a sort of cos- 
mic ark, constructed by the com- 
mon effort of all the intelligent 
races of an ancient galaxy, designed 
to carry them to safety when the 
galactic core explodes. Materials for 
it could come from many thousands, 
or even millions of stellar sys- 
tems. Iron and its sister metals, in- 
cidentally, ought to be relatively 
plentiful in such an old galaxy, 
much of it formed by natural super- 
novas but more of it artificial. Very 
stable elements, they would be logi- 
cal waste products from the most 
sophisticaed fusion power 
generators. We can assume the 
technology not only to build such 
generators, but to fabricate the 
waste metal into extraordinary al- 
loys. 

85 




Even given such alloys, however, 
there are still grave engineering 
problems in placing a solid shell 
around a star. No possible metal 
would be rigid enough to support it- 
self against the gravitation of the 
central sun, or even against the pull 
of its own mass. Though a hollow 
sphere might be rotated fast enough 
to support its equatorial zone with 
centrifugal force, its polar regions 
would fall in. 

The solution we found was to 
surround the star with several layers 
of ring-shaped tubes. The tubes 
themselves are stationary, but they 
contain a heavy, low -viscosity fluid 
flowing fast enough to create the 
centrifugal force required to support 
the tubes and the loads above them. 
One set of parallel tubes holds up 
the “equator” — which isn’t really 
moving — and other sets, tilted at 
suitable angles, support the regions 
near the “poles.” 

The tubes are also heat-engines, 
with the fluid driven by energy ab- 
sorbed from the sun and flowing 
through generator stations which 
supply power to all the inhabited 
levels above. Master computers ad- 
just the velocity of flow to fit the 
loads. 

Cuckoo is enormous. With a 
radius of 86 million miles — 200 
times that of our sun — it’s 540 mil- 
lion miles in circumference. The 
surface area is vast almost beyond 
imagination — some 9 x 10'® square 
miles. Space enough for story ac- 
tion! 



Though light for its size — a high 
vacuum in the same space might 
weigh more — it’s heavy enough. 
The entire construction, including 
tubes and fluid, living quarters and 
control devices and surface armor, 
cargo and fuel and atmosphere, has 
some ten times the mass of the star 
inside, which in turn is heavier by 
half than our sun. 

The shell is equivalent in weight 
to a plate of solid steel more than 
two miles thick; with the open 
spaces between the several levels, 
its total thickness is some forty 
miles. Massively armored, with the 
supporting tubes arranged in multi- 
ple layers, it is well protected from 
accidental damage. 

With fifteen solar masses. Cuc- 
koo has a surface gravity about one 
percent that of Earth. This is force 
enough to hold the atmosphere 
which has collected above the out- 
side armor. Part of this is interstel- 
lar gas; most of it is waste oxygen 
and helium from nuclear power 
plants which use water for fuel — 
tanks for this fuel form vast seas on 
Cuckoo’s surface. This oxy-helium 
mix is breathably dense at the lower 
levels and a hundred times as deep 
as the air of Earth. 

The last link in the complex 
energy-chain from the inner star, 
carrying convective heat from the 
metal surface toward open space, 
the atmosphere of Cuckoo has its 
own awesome meteorology, with 
storm-clouds rising a thousand miles 
high.

GALAXY 




Launched out of its exploding 
home galaxy in search of new 
worlds, the sphere is not only a 
super-planet but a supership. An 
immense ramjet, it uses magnetic 
fields created by the flow in the 
centrifugal tubes to sweep up cos- 
mic gas, which is drawn past the 
central sun, energized, and expelled 
behind. 

The propulsion system raised new 
engineering problems, the worst of 
them due to the fact that a star at 
the center of a massive hollow shell 
is in unstable equilibrium, so that 
any nudge would tend to tip it to- 
ward collision. We were able, how- 
ever, to turn this dangerous instabil- 
ity into a means of propulsion. The 
solution here is to store the surplus 
water and centrifugal fluid in 
enormous tanks spaced about the 
sphere, with a system of pumps to 
empty or fill them as necessary to 
adjust the gravitational balances to 
keep the sun in place at the center 
of the moving globe. 

This pump system and other con- 
trols are hooked to a complex net of 
sensors inside the sphere and on or- 
bital satellites, and to the master 
computers, which are entirely au- 
tomatic robot devices equipped with 
failsafe defenses and elaborately 
protected against time, accident, 
and vandalism. 

The passengers of Cuckoo are 
less immune to time and change. As 
the sphere was completed, they left 
their home planets for their alloted 
spaces in the levels between the in-

most layer of centrifugal tubes and 
the heavy outside armor. Most of 
them are still there, some still ac- 
tive, others surviving in various 
states of arrested animation. 

By now the sphere has been in 
flight for hundreds of millions or 
perhaps billions of years, the rem- 
nants of its exploded native 
galaxy lost in the cosmos behind. 
Some of the races that built it are 
extinct; many have forgotten their 
origins, evolving or degenerating into 
wholly different orders of life, often 
in conflict with one another. 

The outer surface was at first an

much of it is covered now with soil 
from accumulated cosmic dust and 
the industrial wastes dumped from

evolved there, supported by the

process of thermosynthesis. These 
plants are often luminescent, so that 
vast landscapes glow with varied 
color. There’s animal life, adapted 
to the low gravity and to varied 
local conditions of light or dark- 
ness, heat or cold, wild storms or 
unending calm — with no rotation 
and no external sun. Cuckoo had no 
seasonal climatic change. Most of 
these beings evolved on the surface, 
but some are migrants from below. 
A few are human. 

Not, however, native to Cuckoo. 
Much fiction to the contrary, our 
human body can’t be a cosmic 
norm. There are arguments, of 
course, that the evolution of intelli- 
gence on every world would tend to 
follow parallel tracks, that the logic 
of change would demand our 
bipedal shape and our erect posture, 
elevating the eyes and the brain and 
freeing the hands for tool-making. 
But all those arguments are 
rationalizations, I suspect, which 
overlook the chance factors that 
have helped make us what we are. 

The human inhabitants of Cuckoo 
are descendants of specimens taken 
by a scouting ship from Cuckoo that 
touched Earth many thousand years 
ago. Escaping to the surface, they 
have evolved physique and culture 
88 



to fit their new environment. 
Though still at a primitive level, 
they’ve learned to fly with crude 
leather-and-fabric wings. 

Though we’ve assumed 

technologies for interstellar flight 
for our own galactic cultures as well 
as for the builders of Cuckoo, 
we’ve tried to respect the velocity 
of light as a relativistic limit to the 
speed of any material thing. For a 
solution to the problems of com- 
munication, we call on Jeny Fein- 
berg’s tachyon, the hypothetical 
subatomic particle whose 

minimum-energy velocity is infinite. 
Though nothing material can be sent 
by tachyon beam, holographic scan- 
ning of objects and even of living 
beings yields information that can 
be transmitted to produce instan- 
taneous replicates — copies of an 
original that remains safe at home. 

In bald outline, these have been 
the basic assumptions of our trilogy, 
the bare physical foundation for all 
the complex extrapolations of cul- 
ture and society and character and 
action that go into the making of 
fiction. The Farthest Star is already 
published. The novels to follow will 
continue to trace the impacts of 
Cuckoo on our galaxy. The details 
are beyond the scope of this paper, 
but I find designing such worlds a 
stimulating exercise of the imagina- 
tion, more exciting than crossword 
puzzles or duplicate bridge. I hope 
readers will enjoy the exploration of 
Cuckoo as much .as Fred and I did 
the building of it. ★

What makes Sanderman run? 
Why, Candyboxes’ legs, of 
coursel 



The little purpled-headed boy 
of summer squatted in a semi- 
military position beside the path and 
watched the ants falling down the 
sides of anthills. He had come be- 
fore daybreak to sit by the path in 
the hopes that he might speak with 
the master. His little purple head 
was filled with visions of material 
gain. 

If he brought his master the 
tongue of a human being would not 
his master be pleased? Would not 
his master give him a wondrous gift 
if he could bring the master a naked 
lizard shaped like an aircraft car- 
rier? Rappi’s head was full of such 
thoughts. Most of all he desired to 
please the master, which was not an 
easy task. 

First one had to meet him. In 
order to do that it was necessary to 
hide in the bushes beside the path, 
keeping a sharp lookout for the 
master, all the while hoping to 
catch him in a good mood. “When 
the master is ugly from the toes up, 

90 



you will be underfoot,” was one of 
the sayings in the village. “The day 
the nine-legged horse steps on the 
master’s foot is not a good day to 
kick the master’s dog.” That was 
another saying in the village. When 
one dealt with the master, one had 
to watch out. 

The ants were busily engaged in 
dragging stuff up the anthills so 
other ants could push it back down 
again. There was a saying in the 
village; “as busy as an ant and 
twice as nuts.” The village was lull 
of good sayings. Rappi was trying 
to turn an ant over with a dead 
cone-pole snake he had found in a 
bush by sitting on it. 

There was a wild, crashing noise 
off in the distance. It sounded like 
two semi-elephants mating through 
a knothole in a wooden fence. It 
sounded like a flamenco dance 
troupe being raped by a Salvation 
Army Band. It was loud and 
seemed to be heading in Rappi’s di- 
rection. 

Rappi jumped with fright and 
dove even farther back into the 
bushes. Perhaps it is the whistling 
moose that swallows little boys, 
thought Rappi. Perhaps it is the big 
old Wild Man of the Mountains, the 
toothless one who gummed little 
children to death whenever he 
caught them. Perhaps. 

Rappi crouched flat against the 
ground in terror, his primitive mind 
filled with childish fears and super- 
stitions. A grey and white thing with 
a sunburn and a peeling nose 

GALAXY 




smashed through the bushes and 
onto the trail right in front of 
Rappi. Rappi allowed himself to 
relax a little. It was only the mas- 
ter. 

But the master was being very 
much ugly from his feet on up. He 
was yelling like he had needles 
through his shirttails and he looked 
like he had been dragged across the 
jungle by a slow snake. His shirt 
was three colors, two of them dirty, 
and his pants were dirty here and 
there, being clean mostly ia the 
places where they had holes. The 
holes were very clean. 

It was not a good day for the 
jungle. He was tearing it up left and 
right and scorching the air with his 
language. Rappi decided he would 
stay in the bush and not bother the 
master today. Rappi could not think 
of any saying in the village that 
covered hiding in the bushes when 
the master was like he was, but he 
thought to himself, that there sure 
ought to be one. 

* ♦ * 

Ideas went through the master 
like a hiss in his brain. There was a 
ringing in his ears and a constant 
pounding at his temples. He 
smashed through some reeds near 
the river bank and his shirt caught 
on a thorbush and came off in two 
big hunks, and armhole for each hunk. 

He swore and swung at the bush 
with his fist. The blood that started 
flowing out of his hand sobered him 
a little. It hurt like hell and that 



brought him a little closer to ration- 
ality than he had been all day. 

It reminded him why he was an- 
gry. It was that damn Rappi who 
had used the last of his shirts to 
clean out the lizard cages. Or was it 
Bappi? All those damn aliens 
looked alike. They even had the 
same sort of names. Whoever it 
was, if he ever caught him, he’d 
flay him to the bone. 

Of course, that wasn’t the real 
reason he was upset. No, it went 
deeper than that. It was rain and the 
legs of a stripper named Candy 
Boxes. 

It hadn’t rained in seven months. 
He would have sold his mother for 
a cup of water. How long had he 
been drinking the muck the natives 
of Mintfrappe siphoned out of trees? 
Had it really been seven months? 
Seven months of Virpa sap which 
tasted like something the dog 
brought home instead of depositing 
with upraised leg on the fire hy 
drant. 

And one of those crotty aliens, 
how the hell did he know which 
one, had tried to take the tacks out 
of the picture of her he had nailed 
over his bed. Enrico Fermi! Those 
idiots would eat anything with metal 
in it! One night he woke up and 
two of them were under the bed, 
chewing on his bedsprings. It was 
one hell of a life. 

And Candy Boxes, did she care 
about him? If he wrote her a letter, 
saying, “DEAR CANDY, THE 
DOG ATE THE TOP HALE OF 



LOVELIFE OF THE LEGLORN 



91 




YOUR PICTURE BUT I STILL 
HAVE YOUR LEGS ON MY 
WALL” would she care? No, she 
wouldn’t care. She’d just laugh and 
jump on top of an astronaut. It was 
depressing. 

He knew she was laughing at him 
and running around jumping on as- 
tronauts. That was what sent him in 
desperation into the Planetary 
Foreign Legion and to this God for- 
saken planet. She had an uncontrol- 
lable urge for astronauts, planetary 
explorers and spacemen of all types. 
He could never quite reconcile him- 
self to it somehow. He was always 
tripping over a spacer’s tote bag in 
the bathroom. There was always 
somebody shaving in the mirror be- 
fore he got up in the morning. And 
they all had tatoos on their arms 
that said in Old English script 
MOTHER. 

He would have had himself tat- 
tooed too if he would have thought 
it would have made any difference 
to her. It wouldn’t have. Candy 
Boxes liked only what was fashion- 
able and what was fashionable were 
the brave men who explored space, 
roaming the galaxy to come back to 
earth after months of celibacy, hom- 
ier than hot rabbits with socks on. 
The in-thing to do was relieve these 
brave men, to comfort them after 
their prolonged abstinence. After 
all, said fVomen’s Bare Daily, what 
greater reward could the women of 
earth offer these returning heroes? 
Candy Boxes agreed with that sen- 
timent entirely. She agreed with it 

92 



everywhere and with everyone. She 
agreed to it in a variety of posi- 
tions. That was why Sanderman re- 
tired from chiropodist work and 
signed up for space duty. 

Did Candy Boxes know her legs 
were on the wall? Sanderman the 
master used to beat the little alien 
girl called Dunchfito because she 
didn’t have Candy Boxes’ legs. 
Dunchfito had her name tattooed on 
each of her legs, hoping it would 
help him figure out that he was cer- 
tainly right about little Dunchfito’ s 
legs not being Candy Boxes’ legs. 
It did not seem to help in any way 
or clear up the confusion. Dunchfito 
always got her revenge though. 

She always waited till he fell 
asleep then cracked him over the 
head with a rubber-headed mallet. He 
always woke up the next morning 
with a blinding headache and a 
fuzzy spot on his head that was be- 
ginning to soften after several 
months of nightly poundings. He 
never woke up when she hit him 
but he did have reoccuring dreams. 
Sometimes he dreamed he was a 
tennis ball, sometimes he dreamed 
the entire chorus line of a musical 
variety show was kicking his head 
in. 

His dreams did not terrify him 
but he did wake up a lot of times in 
the morning with the feeling that 
the entire population of Mintfrappe 
had walked across his tongue in 
their socks. 

As blood dripped from his 
thorn-damaged knuckles, waves of 

GALAXY 




grey matter fluttered like clouds in 
his brain. He just had to mangle 
something, to bash its stupid breath- 
ing face in. Tear its legs off, get 
hair between his teeth, see pulp, 
pulp. The more he thought of it, the 
more he felt like going berserk. 

He cursed like a madman and 
went boiling off into the jungle 
again. He smashed through a par- 
ticularly thick clump of bushes and 
fell into the river like an old stuffed 
duck with loose wings. The river 
was dry, choked with dust and 
boulders. He missed the dust. 

He sat there, numb from his 
bruised hip up, numb down to the 
toes too. TTiere he was, a once rea- 
sonably intelligent chiropodist, liv- 
ing a comfortable life among the 
feet of other people, maybe a guy a 
little too hung up on . Who the 
hell was doing all that screaming? 

He looked up on the bank and 
saw a dimpo bird shrieking like a 
five alarm fire. Oh Christ, if he 
only had a gun! He used to have a 
gun but one of the damn aliens ate 
it. He’d found the pearl handles 
with teeth marks in them. That was 
all that was left. 

He picked up a rock and heaved 
it with all his might at the bird but 
he missed it completely and it flew 
off screaming even louder. Sander- 
man gave it up. 

* * « 

Every day Sanderman went a little 
bit berseik in the jungle. All it had 

LOVELIFE OF THE LEGLORN 



to do was rain. Just once. Just one 
little, insignificant day of rain and 
he could get out of there. The river 
was the only way out and the only 
way out was dry. The time when 
the rains should have come was al- 
ready gone. Long since gone. The 
only way into the village of 
Mintfrappe was down the river after 
the rains came. He had been as- 
signed there until the rains came 
and his replacement could boat in as 
he, Sanderman, rode the river out. 
No one had yet figured out how to 
make a metal-free air- vehicle. 

The village he was stranded in 
was surrounded by inpenetrable 
jungle. A hundred times he had set 
out to beat his way back to civiliza- 
tion only to return defeated to the 
village of Mintfrappe. He had tor- 
tured dreams of being stuck there 
forever. What if it never rained 
ever? What if Candy Boxes ran off 
and married a lunar module sales- 
man? His life was a nightmare of 
just such hideous possibilities, made 
all the more hideous because he 
was, so to speak, up the river with- 
out a river. 

His anger spent, his hip bruised, 
he limped back into the village 
compound with his hands over his 
ears. He was unable to shut out the 
inevitable sound of the nutcracker 
birds the natives kept as pets. There 
was a continuous cracking sound. 
Crack. Crack. It continued unabated 
twenty-four hours a day. Crack. 
Crack. When they ran out of nuts, 
they did impressions. Crack. Crack. 

93 




It brought tears into his eyes. 

An old purple-headed man 
crawled out of one of the doorways. 
One of his legs looked like a CARE 
package for Doctor Frankenstein. 

“I hurts my hoofer,” said the old 
man, smiling like he deserved 
praise. ‘‘Will master look, see, 
view, get eyeball of, leg?” 

The old man shook his purple 
head from side to side like a dog 
suppressing a sneeze. 

‘‘Nuts!” said Sanderman, with a 
look of disgust. ‘‘Can’t you see I’m 
crazy?” 

‘‘Eye is 20/20,” said the old 
man. ‘‘You describe, I tell you if 
see it. What colors is it most of?’ ’ 

‘‘Nuts,” said Sanderman. The 
statement had very little feeling left 
in it by now. 

‘‘Colors of nuts, most sure,” said 
the old man, falling over as his bad 
leg collapsed under him without 
warning. 

Sanderman bent over him and 
unwrapped the strip of bark that one 
of the native women had tied 
around it. An old dead rat fell out 
of the wrappings. It was a dead rat 
of the long-dead variety. 

‘‘What the hell is this doing in 
there!” screamed Sanderman. 

‘‘Lunch,” said the old man, in- 
nocently. 

Without a moment of hesitation, 
Sanderman turned around and 
tossed his cookies all over the ground. 
He tossed them in one beautiful, 
continuous stream that splashed 
merrily over his shoes. 

94 



The old man stared at the remains 
of Sanderman’s breakfast with the 
respectful eye of the gourmet, with 
the speculative eye of the compari- 
son shopper. Fortunately, Sander- 
man was unaware of it or he would 
be bent over even longer, pumping 
long after his well was dry. 

“What you say master? You cure 
leg up? Put the fix cure up?” said 
the old man, wanting to know. 

Sanderman, holding his stomach 
with one hand, picked up the rat 
with the other and tossed it over his 
shoulder. 

“Lunch,” said the old man sadly 
as it flew over Sanderman’s shoul- 
der. 

Sanderman ground his teeth to- 
gether so hard his gums got flesh 
wounds and bent over to examine 
the old man’s wound. It reminded 
him of a girl he knew in New York. 
The city not the state. She always 
wore red socks. She had a pimple 
on her right knee. Or was it her 
left? He couldn’t remember her face 
but the knees were very familiar. 

“Filthy!” said Sanderman. 
“You’re dying! I told you! I told 
you! How many times did I tell 
you?” 

“At least,” said the old man 
calmly. 

The whole leg was rotten. It was 
falling off. It was so rotten moss 
was growing on one side of it. It 
was so rotten the woodpeckers 
would be after him in a week or 
two thought Sanderman with what 
was hardly a rational thought since 

GALAXY 




there were no woodpeckers in 
Mintfrappe. 

Everybody was sick with some- 
thing. It was the national pastime. 
The climate of Mintfrappe was 
lousy. The weather featured mild 
and balmy diseases, festering to- 
morrow with fever highs in the low 
hundreds. The village idiot used to 
have worms in his ears. He had put 
them there himself. They kept 
crawling out. He was the only one 
too stupid to catch something. He 
was the only healthy one in the 
whole village and was universally 
despised. The village idiot was the 
old man. He finally settled on a 
surprise amputation which didn’t 
woik. At least not completely. He 
fainted before he got halfway to the 
bone of his leg. In that sense, he 
had failed, but the resultant infec- 
tion had brought him into his own 
socially. The fact that he was dying 
of it was the height of fashion. Of 
late however, the old man had 
begun to show a markedly hostile 
attitude towards the prevailing no- 
tions of what was considered fash- 
ionable. That was why he was the 
village idiot. He had a short atten- 
tion span and could never finish 
anything. 

“Will you cure, fix up, me with 
the stinger in seatbox?” 

“Get out of here!’’ roared San- 
dertnan. “I hope the toes on your 
other foot fall off too!’’ 

“Why thanking you most 
much,’’ said the old man, smiling 
happily at the thought.

Sanderman watched him limp 
away and he didn’t know whether 
he was suf^osed to be angry or dis- 
gusted OT depressed. He worked at 
trying to be all three but then he 
thought about the picture on the 
wall of Candy Boxes’ legs and he 
settled on being suicidally de- 
pressed. 

He still had the urge to kill some- 
thing, a feeling in no way damp- 
ened by the legs on the wall of his 
cabin. If anything, Candy Boxes’ 
legs were a further incitement to 
riot. Aren’t legs always what cause 
riots? It seemed that it must be so 
to Sanderman. 

A drop of moisture splashed 
coolly against his forehead. It struck 
softly but had the effect of an ex- 
plosion on Sanderman. 

He leaped into the air, head 
reared back, mouth open to receive 
the liquid. Rain! Rain! Rain! His 
blessed rain! His ticket back to 
Candy Boxes! A drop of liquid 
melted on his tongue and his eyes 
sunk into his head. He looked like 
he had Just been mounted and 
stuffed. His eyes looking up, his ears 
hearing that sound. He gagged. 
Crack. Crack. He threw up with 
nothing left to throw up. Those 
damn nutcracker birds! He fell to 
the ground, completely fagged from 
gagging. 

He’d had quite a day. Sanderman 
closed his eyes wearily. He could 
just see it. 

At this very moment. Candy 
Boxes would be putting a slug in 

96 



the juke box back on earth, U.S.A. 
Back there in Mother Flicker’s Bar 
and Billiards room. She’d be shoot- 
ing pool, leaning over the table, her 
boobs sometimes hanging right 
down into the side pockets when 
she was lined up just right. It drove 
him crazy just thinking about it. 
And she had a pitcher of beer at her 
table. Ice cold beer and the glass 
she was pouring it in was almost 
clean by at least two days. It was 
driving him crazy. 

Someone tapped him on the 
shoulder. It was the old man again. 

“Can 1 eats belt buckle?” asked 
the old man. 

“What?” screamed Sanderman, 
his hand unconsciously straying to 
the worn metal buckle of his 
Planetary Foreign Legion issue belt. 
“What!” 

“Owed me for lunch rat throwed 
without being able to find,” said 
the old man, teetering on one leg in 
front of Sanderman. The old man 
looked determined. 

He left Candy Boxes with one of 
her breasts in the side pocket. He 
tore the belt off with a kind of le- 
thal frenzy and thrust it at the old 
man with a vicious swing. The old 
man fell over sideways with the belt 
wrapped around his neck. Sander- 
man seemed unaware of the old 
man’s tumble. Just as the old man 
began gnawing on his belt buckle. 
Candy Boxes sank the eight ball 
and an astronaut reached out and 
dragged her under the table. 

Sanderman screamed with impo- 

GALAXY 




tent fury and went dashing madly 
off in the direction of the jungle 
again. He ran headfirst into a tree 
and that brought him back to his 
senses, in the sense that he imag- 
ined that it knocked the astronaut 
out. He slid down the side of the 
tree and rested. 

Almost in front of him, the 
bushes parted and a lizard shaped 
like a volkswagon with a tongue 
stepped out into the sunlight. The 
perfect victim. Sanderman’s hands 
squeezed imaginary pulp in anticipa- 
tion of the lunge. Just as he was 
ready to spring all 200 pounds of 
him on the helpless lizard his atten- 
tion was distracted by a rather large 
snake of the unkissably poisonous 
variety. It was one of those snakes 
in the who-to-avoid and what-not- 
to-touch category. It had an un- 
pleasant talent for being fatally 
poisonous. It was a Foogi Snake, 
the most dreaded reptile on 
Mintfrappe. 

The snake oozed toward the 
lizard which promptly froze in its 
tracks, its tail going limp as a stock 
market quotation. 

“Kill it,” shouted Sanderman, 
aware that the snake needed no 
cheerleading section. 

The snake moved on oiled gears, 
coiling like a crocheted doily just 
inches from the doomed lizard’s 
snout. The snake moved its head from 
side to side in a hypnotic, sleep- 
inducing rhythm. 

“Kill it for me!” whispered San- 
derman. 

LOVELIFE OF THE LEGLORN 



Suddenly, a shadow fell over 
Sanderman and he looked up at the 
sky. For the first time in months, 
the sky was full of clouds. 

“The rain!” he shouted. “The 
rain!” He was in an absolute de- 
lirium, overjoyed to tears. 

He brought his head back down, 
taking his eyes off the sky and 
looked once more at the doomed 
lizard and the Foogi snake. 

The Foogi snake had fallen asleep 
and the lizard had already ingested 
a third of him. 



•k -k ir 

Two days later, Sanderman 
pulled what was left of the roof of 
his shack off of what was left of the 
rest of his body. It had been one 
hell of a storm. It had been a real 
frog strangler. Yes sir, a dust storm 
like Mintfrappe had never seen be- 
fore and gale winds up to ninety 
miles an hour. Dust and more dust 
and nothing but dust. He spat out 
dust like an upchucking Sphinx. 

If there had been something left 
standing, he would have hung him- 
self from it immediately, but the 
whole place was flatter ftian Lizzie 
Borden’s love life. He crawled out 
from under the building slowly. 
There was a persistent buzzing in 
his ears. It was increasing in vol- 
ume. 

It seemed to be coming from 
above him. He was afraid to look 
up for fear his head when once bent 

97 




back, would continue backwards 
until it fell off. He took a chance 
anyway. 

It was a spaceship. It was prepar- 
ing to touch down. He blinked his 
eyes to make sure it was real. It 
was real. He let out a whoop, 
staggered to his feet, and began tot- 
tering in the direction of the ship. 

It touched down in a great uprush 
of dust as the jets fanned the 
ground, easing the big ship to a 
soft, near- perfect touchdown. 

The ramp was down before he 
got there. The hatch opened as he 
hit the edge of the ramp. Candy 
Boxes stood framed in the hatch- 
way, with only her head and torso 
visible. 

Sanderman’s head stuck to the 
roof of his mouth. He had her legs 
etched indelibly on his mind. How 
he had ached for the touch of them! 
The sight of them! Glorious legs, 
wonderful legs of the evening! Like 
two poles of pearls shifting towards 
the center of the universe! Legs! 
Legs like drink-stirring rods made 
out of honey and satin! Legs that 
were win, place and show at the 
hundred dollar window! Legs that 
played the tuba in the backseat of 
his mental car! Legs! Legs! 

He stood paralyzed at the edge of 
the ramp. Her face didn’t exist. The 
dog had eaten it away much too 
long ago. It was her legs that were 
his memory of her. How he longed 
to tie his tongue around her dimpled 
knees! How he ached to encircle her 
ankles with his socks! 

98 



She stepped through the archway 
and came toward him. She seemed 
taller. She was. She stood on two 
bright aluminum legs that gleamed 
bristly beneath her. Her steps were 
smooth and fluid. 

“Sanderman!” she cried. “I’ve 
come back to you! My long lost 
lover! My spaceman hero! Rescued 
at last!’’ 

His mouth fell open in an imita- 
tion of the Grand Canyon. 

“Your, your . WHAT HAP- 
PENED TO YOUR LEGS?????????? 

“Oh, you noticed!’’ she said 
coyly. “Why, artificial legs are all 
the rage back on earth now! You 
know me, always keeping up with 
the latest fashions. How do you like 
them dear? Don’t you think their 
gleam is positively sinful? 

, * ♦ ★ 

He fainted and fell back into the 
dust like a meteor entering the at- 
mosphere. There was a burning fi- 
nality to his faint. 

He died right there and then of a 
broken heart. 

“Jeez,” said Candy Boxes, “he 
was overcome with emotion.” 

* ★ * 

If only he had known that 
Candy Box’s own precious originals 
were carefully, cryrogenically stored 
away for future use, and that he 
could have had them for himself 
alone, not even sharing them with 
Candy Boxes! Such is the stuff of 
which great tragedies are made, ir 

GALAXY 




Human Alpha was not In Errorl 



Human alpha said to Human 
Beta, “Go Dismantle.” 

For a moment the four Guardians 
were motionless in the control room 
of Narcopolis 408. Outside the 
room, in the vast pyramidal vault 
that surrounded them, there was 
only the whispering sound of nu- 
trient pumps, exhaust fans, and 
feelie tapes, as eighty-six million 
hibernating humans dreamt of love 
or battle or boredom. 

“Go Dismantle!” 

Human Beta was confused, and 
so hesitated until the conditioned 
phrase filtered through his brain and 
connected solidly with motor re- 
flexes. Then he sighed and turned 
away, going directly to the Dis- 
mantling chute. 

Human Alpha smiled and looked 
back at the two robots, who were 
watching the situation without 
comment. There was no way to tell 
what they were thinking. Their 
smooth ovoid heads were sheeted in 
white rubber, exactly featureless.

Human Beta, the other human 
Guardis, reached the chute, braced 
his hands on the sides of the open- 
ing, and jumped in. The last they 
saw of him was the pink bald head, 
the broad black-suited back, and the 
large white letter B disappearing 
into the dark. The last they heard 
was a faint sucking noise. 

Human Alpha turned back to his 
control board, humming. He was 
making a feelie tape of the Dis- 
mantling of Human Beta. 

The two white-jumpsuited an- 
droids got up simultaneously and 
stood behind the human, who was 
busy augmenting the tape. It was 
their job to oversee the human 
Guardians, just as it was the hu- 
mans’ responsibility to guard against 
robotic failure. Qieck and counter- 
check, the Narcopolis was secured 
against operator error. 

Now, for some reason of his 
own, one of the human Guardians 
had cancelled his partner. It needed 
looking into . 

“What are you doing!” asked 
Robot Alpha. 

The human slipped the tape from 
the recorder and dropped it down 
the INPUT slot. 

Robot Alpha tapped him on the 
shoulder. 

“What?” said the human. 
“Don’t bother me!” 

“If you subject the population to 
the death trauma of Human Beta 
they will be damaged.” 



GALAXY 




Human Alpha turned from the 
console and looked at the robot with 
the black A on its chest. The robot 
scanned him in turn. The human 
was the twin of his Dismantled 
partner — dressed in black jumpsuit, 
hairless, serene. He had a white A 
on his chest. “Robot Alpha?” 

“Yes.” 

“Go Dismantle.” 

It was the cancellation code again 
and it was not to be ignored. This 
time there was no hesitation. 

it It ir 

Now there were two Gardians in 
the control room of Narcopolis 408. 

Human Alpha turned back to the 
console and punched up a universal 
feelie playback. Throughout the 
vault, tapes were changing. Ending 
abruptly were wars and romances, 
games of tennis and banking, 
dreams of heroism and degradation. 
Now began, in excruciating detail 
and amplified sense, the Disman- 
tling of Human Beta. 

Repeat, repeat, repeat . 

Within twenty minutes there were 
forty-nine million corpses in the 
vault. Virtually no-one over four 
hundred survived the trauma, and 
thousands died who had been in the 
vault only two centuries, the last to 
go in. 

The human turned again from the 
console, but before he could speak. 
Robot Beta said, “Human Alpha, 



you are in error. Go Dismantle.” 

The human laughed. “No. You 
Dismantle. I mean, ‘Go Disman- 
tle.’ ” 

The robot hesitated, then said, “I 
cannot Dismantle as long as another 
unresolved order to Dismantle re- 
mains in my data banks. You must 
Dismantle first, then I can Disman- 
tle.” 

“Stalemate, huh?” 

“So it appears. We’ll have to call 
for Arbitration. First, though, the 
population must be restored to nor- 
mal programming.” The robot 
reached into the console and set up 
a random selection from the old 
tapes, from bins marked Bread, 
Mystery, and Authority. Inside the 
vault, the remaining thirty-seven or 
so millions resumed their dreams of 
life, while draincocks opened to the 
flow of adrenaline now filtering out 
of bloodstreams. Automatic body 
removal began, clattering noisily. 

Robot Beta crossed the room to 
the Inspector’s Closet and opened 
the door. Inside, a humanoid 
waited, dressed in black robes. His 
fleshoid face retained an expression 
of patient benevolence; his eyes 
were closed, shadowed by the black 
hood of Arbitration. The Inspector 
held penultimate responsibility to 
the sleeping Designers of Nar- 
copolis System, and his terminal- 
bodies waited vacantly in five 
hundred identical control rooms. 
His stem plast-flesh face evoked a 

101 



GUARDIANS AT THE GATE OF AAORPHEUS 




sense of trust in the human Guard- 
ians. 

The robot Guardian parted the 
black robe on the humanoid chest 
and revealed an electric sign: 

The Inspector is out 

It pushed the call button and step- 
ped back. In a moment the Inspec- 
tor’s mind arrived via satellite, the 
body chimed and jumped, the sign 
changed: 

The Inspector is in 

The Inspector stepped into the 
control room, blinking and smiling. 
In a deep, soothing voice he said, 
“What seems to be the problem?” 

Robot Beta leaned toward the In- 
spector, as if offering its dinosaur- 
egg-head for benediction. 

“Hey, no fair!” cried the human. 
“You gotta talk out loud so I know 
what lies you’re telling.” 

Robot Beta stepped back and 
said, “The least of it is that we 
need two new Guardians; one hu- 
man, one robot. We’ve experienced 
two Dismantlings here lately, in ad- 
dition to substantial population attri- 
tion. 

The Inspector crossed to the con- 
sole and plugged a finger into the 
computerlog. “This is unusual,” he 
said. Jerking his finger out of the 
jack. 

“Furthermore,” said Robot Beta, 
“we need Arbitration on a pair of 
unresolved Dismantle orders.” 

“I see.” The Inspector repeated a 
code that cancelled both orders, 

102 



then he commenced his inspection. 

“You’re lucky I was free,” he 
said. “I just completed Arbitration 
at N99 and N223 and N361, and 
I’m still inspecting a dozen or so 
Narcopoles on my routine schedule. 
There appears to be some trouble in 
the System.” 

The human stood close by, sul- 
lenly picking at a seam behind the 
Inspector’s fleshoid ear. The Inspec- 
tor was starting to unravel. 

“Don’t ask me why I did it,” 
said Human Alpha. “I just had an 
impulse to Dismantle my partner 
and run the tape for the popula- 
tion.” He smiled at the Inspector 
and peeled a sheet of fleshoid off 
his cheek. (It was stainless steel un- 
derneath.) 

“My son, you must fight these 
impulses.” 

“I try.” He picked at the Inspec- 
tor’s lips, then with both hands tore 
off the mouth, along with a comer 
of the nose. 

“You may face severe disci- 
pline,” the Inspector was saying 
through a circle of grillwork under 
where the mouth had been. 

“So what?” 

“Inspector, this human Guard- 
ian’s erratic behavior is quite re- 
cent. He has in general performed 
his duties excellently.” 

“Shut up,” Human Alpha said, 
pulling the Inspector’s nose up and 
out. The fleshoid flap crackled and 
popped as it lifted from the ovoid 
steel head. The eyes came off with 
the sockets. 



GALAXY 




The Inspector reached up and 
touched the human’s hand. “What 
are you doing there?” 

“Never mind.” 

The Inspector, whose vision per- 
ceptors were located in his head, 
barely realized his face was being 
peeled off. 

“Why did you refuse a lawful 
Dismantling order?” 

Human Alpha paused. “I really 
don’t know. When I heard him say 
it, I got all warm inside, and I 
half-wanted to do it, to go Disman- 
tle, but there — ” 

(The Inspector murmured the 
neutralizing code.) 

“ — there was something stopping 
me.” 

“What was it?” 

The human shook his head 
slowly, then thoughtfully peeled off 
the final bit. The Inspector’s face 
was in his hands, and a silver ovoid 
now gleamed through a fine net of 
adhesive. The black cowl was snap- 
ped to the skull over bald steel. 

The Inspector said, “You have to 
be Probed, you know.” 

“I guess so.” 

“Give me your hands.” 

The human discarded the Inspec- 
tor’s face and placed his hands in 
the Inspector’s cold gloves. Their 
heads inclined and touched. Human 
Alpha felt an electric pulse stroke 
his brain, opening blossoms of light 
in the sightless dark. Unconscious 
urgings probed upward, piercing the 
calm surface of his awareness, 
twisting into half-formed com-

mands. Something enormous and 
compelling lurked just beneath . 

“Oh, dear,” said the Inspector. 
“I seem to see ...” 

The human jumped back and fell 
over his swivel chair, his face red 
and blotched. He squirmed a mo- 
ment in palsied excitation, then 
leapt to his feet shouting some gib- 
berish. 

Robot Beta said, “This human 
has gone awry.” 

The Inspector nodded stiffly. “It 
is some bit of his conditioning com- 
ing to the surface.” 

“Whe-wh-wh-when-n-n-na-co- 

o-o!” 

“Will he die?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“When-na-corso-so-hyu-hu-hu-

“You will have to order a new 
pair of humans from Supply,” said 
Robot Beta. 

“We shall see.” 

“When-nana-courso-hyu-hyuuma-

The Inspector bent his gleaming 
head toward the human. “I beg your 
pardon?” 

“What’s he saying?” 

“Listen.” 

“ When-in-th-courz-of-human- 
evenss!” 

Suddenly the Inspector stood up 
straight and quivered. A bell 
chimed in his chest and he was 
gone for a full minute. 

Robot Beta scanned the red-faced 
human. “Now look what you’ve 
done!”

The bell rang again, and the In- 
spector said, “Everything is all 
right. Robot Beta, go Dismantle.” 

it ir * 

It was done. 

The human sat back in his chair 
breathing hard, his eyes slowly un- 
glazing. “What?” 

“Do what you will in this Nar- 
copolis,” the Inspector was saying. 
“Destroy it if you must; you won’t 
be stopped.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“You are designated Random 
Destroyer by your conditioning. 
You must be allowed to do your 
work unmolested. This information 
was released to me from my data 
banks when you spoke the coded 
phrase. I have checked, there are 
others of you coming out in all the 
Narcopoles. It may be that the time 
of Man is done. In any case the 
plans were sealed centuries ago, 
long before the last human went 
into the vaults.” 

“I’m supposed to tear down the 
Narcopolis? Kill all the popula- 
tion?” 

“Probably. I don’t know. 
Perhaps some — the best — will sur- 
vive.” 

“Why?” 

The Inspector shuddered silently. 
“My data banks instruct me to an- 
swer your question with a word I do 
not know.” 

“What word?” 

“ ‘Mercy.’ ” ★

Part m of III 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Three mittion years after his birth, 
and death by cancer, and revival as a 
set of memories programmed into a 
brain-wiped State criminal, and theft 
of a Bussard ramjet spacecrpft, Corbett 
returns to Earth to die. He’s a fragile 
old man with a few years to live, at 
best. 

The solar system looks like God took 
an eggbeater to it. The sun has become 
far hotter; so has Jupiter. Uranus, if 
that’s Uranus, has lost some atmos- 
phere and is out of its orbit. Earth is 
in orbit about Jupiter. But to Corbett 
the most interesting question is, where 
is the Dictator immortality? 

A different form of immortality has 
been in vogue for a couple of mittion 
years. It must be used on pre- 
adolescents: children of around eleven. 
These grow no older. They live 
forever, with luck, and they don’t have 
children, so there is no population 
problem. There are other problems. It 
seems that Earth’s colonies attacked 
and then abandoned Earth when the 
State on Earth went to children’s im- 
mortality. Then the Boys and Girls 
fought a firud war. Girls are now ex- 
tinct, and the Boys have become sav- 
ages, retaining only a few pre-War 
skills. 

But there was once a form of 
longevity that worked on adults. 
MIRELLY-LYRA ZEELASHISTHAR, 
a menomaniacal old woman with a 
remarkable weapon, is hunting it. She 
has set Corbett to hunting it too. If she 
hunts Corbett down and he doesn’t 
have it, the result may be death by tor- 
ture. The mad crone is sure that the 
Dictator immortality is around, after a 
million years and more. 

106 



And she’s right! Corbett has become 
a young man! The trouble is that he 
has no idea where he ran across Dic- 
tator immortality on his crooked path 
from North America (uninhabitably 
hot) to Antarctica (lush and green, the 
only such on Earth). 

The Boys want it too. Corbett is 
their prisoner. By now they know that 
Corbett doesn’t know anything. They 
watched Corbett make a fool of him- 
self, throwing a cat-tail into an adult’s 
face on the hunch that a cat-tail bite 
carried the longevity serum. If the 
Boys get Dictator immortality they may 
destroy the source. It is the major dif- 
ference between them and the adults 
(Dicta), the Boys’ slaves and breeding 
stock. 

The Diet GORDING is still a 
white-haired old ttuin, now sporting a 
wound on his neck. He too is the 
Boys’ prisoner. He may be Corbett’s 
only ally, now that PEERSSA, the per- 
sonality in Corbett’s shipboard com- 
puter, has abandoned him. In any 
case, Miretty-Lyra now has Corbett’s 
pressure suit helmet including the 
radio link with Peerssa. 

Corbett is up for punishment for hid- 
ing from the Boys his suspicions about 
the cat-tail bite. The Boys have 
marched into the ruined city, Parhald- 
ing. Only the hospital has been kept in 
good corulition . and Corbett won- 
ders if he is Ux be dissected. He is un- 
prepared when Gording suddenly kills 
two Boys and escapes. 

CoRBELL BECAME AWARE that tWO 
Boys were holding his arms. And 
the rest were charging after Gord- 
ing. 

Corbell’s military training was far 
in the past, but he remembered. 

GALAXY 




Stamp down along the shin; the 
enemy doubles up, you twist and 
bring your elbow up — His captors 
faded like ghosts from his blows, 
and a swinging arm caught him pre- 
cisely across the eyes. He was dizzy 
and half blind as they led him up 
flights of stairs. 

^‘They’ll have him soon,” he 
heard Skatholtz say. 

‘‘He’s got thread. We’ll have to 
test every doorway,” said 
Krayhayft. ‘‘Thread is too near in- 
visible, and if it caught a Boy 
across the throat — come, Corbell.” 

They had climbed four flights of 
stairs and gone down a corridor. 
Corbell looked into an operating 
room. Four tables, and spidery 
metal arms above them. 

‘‘Noo!” Corbell thrashed. Your 
pain will be instructive to you and 
to us. They were going to dissect 
him! TTiey pulled him to an operat- 
ing table and fastened him spread- 
eagled, face up. 

‘‘You can’t be sure you know 
everything I know,” he called to 
Krayhayft’s receding back. Nuts, he 
was gone. But Skatholtz hoisted 
himself to sitting position on 
another table. 

‘‘Skatholtz, if you destroy my 
brain, you lose the only viewpoint 
that isn’t just like you own! Now 
think about that!” 

‘‘We’re not going to ruin your 
brain. At least I think we’re not. 
There is that risk.” 

“What are you going to do?’’ 

‘‘We’re going to entertain each 
other. ’ ’ 

Then Krayhayft came jogging 
back with a flask of . blood 
plasma? Clear fluid, anyway. He 
reached over Corbell’ s head and 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



nested it somehow among the tool- 
tipped steel arms. 

Corbell thought. Tell them about 
the car! He swallowed the idea. If 
his sympathy lay with anyone be- 
sides himself, it was with the dikta. 
Let Cording escape if he could. 

A spidery steel arm descended. 
Its hypodermic tip hesitated above 
him, then dipped into his neck. 
Krayhayft’s strong hands held his 
head immobile for an endless time. 
Then the hypo withdrew and the 
arm retracted into its nest. 

Corbell waited. Would the stuff 
put him to sleep? Or only paralyze 
him? 

But Skatholtz was releasing his 
arms and ankles and pulling him to 
his feet. Corbell swayed. TTie stuff 
was doing something to him. 

They took him up three more 
flights of stairs and down a corridor 
and into a small theater. They 
dropped him into a cloud-rug chair. 
Dust puffed up around him. He 
sneezed and tried to get up, but he 
was too dizzy. Something was hap- 
pening to his mind. 

Krayhayft was at work behind 
him somewhere. 

The theater went dark. 

Lights glowed in the dark, infi- 
nitely far away. Stars: the black sky 
of interstellar space. Corbell found 
familiar constellations, distort- 
ed .. and then something told him 
where he was. 

‘‘RNA! You shot memory RNA 
into me! You dirty sons of 
bitches.” he cried in English. ‘‘You 
did it again!” 

‘‘Corbell—” 

‘‘What’ll I be this time? What 
have you made me into?” 

‘‘You’ll keep your memory,” 

107 




said Skatholtz, also in English. 
“You’ll remember things you never 
lived through. You’ll tell us. Watch 
the show.’’ 

He was nearly sixty light-years 
from Sol, viewing what had been 
the State. A voice spoke in a lan- 
guage Corbell had never heard. He 
didn’t try to understand it. He 
watched with a familiar fascination. 
Goodbye, CORBELL Mark II, he 
thought in the back of his mind. In 
thin defiance, But I’m still a lousy 
loser. 

Certain stars glowed more 
brightly than others . and plane- 
tary systems circled them, greatly 
enlarged for effect. Now all but two 
of these systems turned sullen 
red . turned enemy. These were 
the worlds that had turned against the 
State. 

One of the red systems sparkled 
and faded into the background, its 
colony destroyed. 

The neutral systems went red. 

Two more systems faded out. 

The view closed on Sol sys- 
tem ... on more of Sol system 
than Corbell had known, with three 
dark gas giants beyond Pluto, and 
countless swarming comets. 

Fleets of spacecraft moved out 
toward the renegade colonies. Other 
fleets invaded. Sometimes they 
came like a hornet’s nest, many 
ships clustered around a Bussard 
ramjet core. Sometimes like a Por- 
tuguese man-of-war; thousands of 
ships as weights around the fringe 
of a great silver light-sail. Early 
fleets included hospit^ ships and re- 
turn fuel; later there were massive 
suicide attacks. 

It went on for centuries. The 
State utopia became a subsistence 

108 



civilization, turning all its surplus 
energy to war. The fleets moved at 
just less than lightspeed. News of 
success or failure or need for rein- 
forcements moved barely faster. 
The State was Boys and Girls and 
Dictators all united for the common 
good. Corbell hurt with the loss of 
that unity. 

He watched a beam of light bathe 
Sol system: laser cannon fired from 
Farside Colony, launching warships 
by light-sail at terrific accelerations. 
The ships dropped their sails and 
decelerated most of the way to Sol, 
arriving just behind the beam itself, 
long before the State could prepare. 
Corbell squirmed in his chair; he 
wanted to cry warning. For the 
State beat the invaders back, but 
failed to stop their hidden treachery. 

The war continued. Farside, 
economically ruined by its effort, 
fell before the counterattack. It took 
a man’s lifetime . too much 
time, before Astronomy noticed 
what the Farside traitors had done 
in the dark outside their dazzling 
light beam, in the distraction pro- 
vided by the invasion. 

The State had looked for the light 
of fusion spacecraft, not the dim 
watery light of a new planet. The 
trans-Plutonian planet called Perse- 
phone had had a peculiar orbit, 
tilted nearly vertical to the plane of 
the solar system. Its new path had 
already taken it deep into the sys- 
tem. 

The State worked to learn how 
the enemy had done it. 

It learned at last, but not in time. 
It could not stop the gas giant world 
from impacting, not Earth itself, but 
a larger target. Corbell saw the 
hideous flare as 10*® tons of hydro- 

GALAXY 




gen and hydrogen-compound ices 
struck the sun at Solar-escape veloc- 
ity. 

Oceans shrank, crops withered, 
tens of millions died before the 
State could place a disk of reflect- 
ing tinsel between Earth and Sol. It 
was a temporary measure. The 
sun’s new heat was permanent, at 
least on the human scale of time. 
Fusion would run faster in Sol’s 
hotter interior. The buried heat 
would leak to the photosphere and 
out. 

One chance the State had for sur- 
vival. It could move the Earth by 
the method Farside had used to stop 
Persephone cold in its orbit. 

“Do you understand what you’re 
seeing?’ ’ 

Corbell made a shushing gesture. 
“Yeah.’’ 

“Good. We were afraid. The 
light- show and the bottled memory 
are both very old. They date from 
the end of the rule of the Girls. 
They have been stored at the lowest 
possible heat for . perhaps a 
hundred thousand years, perhaps 
more. We feared they must have 
decayed,’’ said Skatholtz. 

“So you tried it on me.’’ But his 
anger seemed impersonal, remote. 

The State had had to abandon the 
Mercury mines: a serious industrial 
handicap. Nonetheless they were 
building something out there in the 
asteroid belt . something huge, 
like a starship big enough to cany 
the whole human race to safety. But 
no, that wasn’t it. Corbell was fas- 
cinated. He knew it might be the 
memory RNA, but he was fasci- 
nated anyway. He hardly heard 
what Skatholtz was saying: 

“It was sensible, Corbell. The 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Girls who made the light-show 
ruled the sky. You are familiar with 
such things. Do you know now 
where the new moon came from?’ ’ 
“Not yet. Shut up and let 
me . .’’ 

They had finished the thing. Two 
tubes, concentric, each a hundred 
miles long; the inner tube a mile 
wide, with thick walls of complex 
construction; the outer tube thinner 
and twice as wide. At one end, a 
bell-shaped rocket nozzle. At the 
other . Corbell knew more than 
he was seeing. Reworked military 
laser cannon, and vents, and a 
flared skirt, and thick stubby fins, 
there at the bottom end. Now tem- 
porary liquid hydrogen tanks were 
attached. Now the structure moved 
under its own power ... it was a 
tremendous fusion motor . mov- 
ing outward, circled by tiny ships 
. yeah. 

Corbell said, “How do you climb 
down off an elephant?’’ 

“Should I know that?” 

“You don’t climb down off an 
elephant. You climb down off a 
duck.” 

“Why?” 

“It’s so much safer. How do you 
move the Earth?” 

Small wonder if the light-show 
meant little to Skatholtz. Watching 
the constmction of the motor, in the 
naked sunlight and sharp-edged, to- 
tally black shadows of space, was 
bewildering. The diagrams made 
sense to an architect, but they were 
only rotating lines to Skatholtz. But 
without bottled memory and without 
Corbell’ s career in space, Skatholtz 
was still bright enough to make 
some sense of what he was seeing. 
“You move something else,’’ 

109 




Skatholtz said. “The damage done 
by the rocket’s thrust and by mis- 
tt^es you might make will not kill 
anyone if nobody lives on the work- 
ing body. Then the working body 
can be moved until the world falls 
toward it as a rock falls to the 
ground. What was the working 
body? Ganymede?’ ’ 

“Uranus. Can you stop the 
light-show at that picture?’’ 

The lecture froze on an “artist’s 
conception”: a blurred, curved arc 
of Uranus’s upper atmosphere. The 
motor looked tiny floating there. 
Corbell said, “You see? It’s a 
double-walled tube, very strong 
under expansion shock. It floats 
vertical in the upper air. Vents at 
the bottom let in the air, which is 
hydrogen and methane and am- 
monia, hydrogen compounds, like 
the air that the sun bums. You fire 
laser cannon up along the axis of 
the motor, using a . color hy- 
drogen won't let through. You get 
a fusion explosion along the axis.” 
“I don’t understand all your 
words. Fusion?” 

“Fusion is the way a star bums. 
You probably used fusion bombs 
against the Girls.” 

“Okay. The hydrogen fusions in 
the middle of the motor — ” 

“ — And the explosion goes out 
and up. It’s hottest along the axis, 
cooler when it reaches the walls of 
the motor. The whole mass blasts 
out the top, through the flared end. 
It has to have an exhaust velocity 
way higher than Uranus’s escape 
velocity. The motor goes smashing 
down into deeper air. You see 
there’s a kind of flared skirt at the 
bottom. The deep air builds up 
there at terrific pressure, stops the 

110 



tube and blasts it back up. You fire 
it again.” 

“Elegant,” said Skatholtz. 

“Yeah. Nobody’s there to get 
killed. Control systems in orbit. The 
atmosphere is fuel and shock ab- 
sorber both — and the planet is 
mostly atmosphere. Even when it’s 
off the motor floats high for awhile, 
because it’s full of not hydrogen 
compounds. If you let it cool off it 
sinks, of course, but you can bring 
it back up to high atmosphere by 
heating the tube with the laser, fir- 
ing it almost to fusion. Start the 
light-show again, will you?” 

Skatholtz barked something at 
Krayhayft. Corbell watched: 

Earth held out, barely. Heat- 
superconducting cables had to be 
mn to the north polar cap to borrow 
its cold. The cap melted. Millions 
died anyway. No children were 
bom; there wasn’t shelter for them. 
It took over a century to drop 
Uranus into place, six million miles 
ahead of the Earth in Earth’s orbit. 
The planet accelerated slowly, 
drawing Earth after it . .and then 
sped up, to leave Earth behind, in a 
wider orbit. They lost the Moon. 

The sun expanded via its own 
internal heat. Light was reddened, 
but the greater surface lost more 
heat to space ... to Earth. By now 
the Girls had charge of Uranus and 
the floating fusion motor. They 
moved the Earth again. 

Five times the Earth had to be 
moved. At one time it was circling 
precisely opposite Mars. Later, fur- 
ther out. Internally Sol’s fusion fur- 
nace had stabilized; but the photo- 
sphere was still growing. And the 
Earth must be moved a sixth 
time . 



GALAXY 




With RNA-augmented intuition 
Corbell said, “Here’s where they 
have their trouble.” 

The Earth was too warm. There 
is a region around any stable sun, a 
rather narrow band in which an Earth- 
like world can have Earthlike 
temperatures. But Sol’s ideal tem- 
perature band had moved too close 
to Jupiter. The giant world would 
have pulled Earth out of or- 
bit . .perhaps into a collision 
course. 

Put Earth in orbit around Jupiter 
itself? But the sun’s heat output was 
levelling off. The Earth would suf- 
fer a permanent ice age . unless 
Jupiter could be made to shine hot- 
ter. 

“I can’t figure that last part,” 
said Corbell. “Run it again.” 

Krayhayft ran it again. Two 
nearly identical astronomical scenes 
divided by a wall across space. 
Corbell watched Uranus pull away 
from Earth, drop behind Ganymede 
and coast outward. Ganymede 
fell . twice. 

In one scene it grazed Jupiter, 
flaring as it passed through the at- 
mosphere a dozen times, finally de- 
caying in a prolonged burst of 
hellfire. In the second scene the 
fleck of light dropped straight in: 
one flare, and gone. 

“Yeah. They tried to be clever,” 
said Corbell. “They thought they 
were good enough to do a two- shot. 
They used Uranus to pull the Earth 
past Jupiter, slowed it to put the 
Earth in Jupiter orbit, then dropped 
Uranus deep into the moon system. 
The idea was to stop Ganym^e al- 
most dead in its tracks. Of course 
the maneuver fouled up a lot of 
lunar orbits.” 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



“What went wrong?” 

“I’m not sure. The Girls wanted 
a grazing orbit. Instead the moon 
dropped straight in. But so what?” 
Skatholtz made no answer. 

“Let’s see. Jupiter puts out more 
heat than it gets from the sun. 
That’s heat left over from when the 
planet fell in on itself out of the 
original dust cloud, four billion 
years ago . my years. So the 
planet could hold heat and leak it 
out for a long, long time. But the 
energies should be the same no mat- 
ter what angle the moon fell at.” 
“This impact, would it cause fu- 
sion? Would Jupiter bum?” 

“Jupiter’s too small to bum like 
a star. Not enough mass, not 
enough pressure. But yeah, there ’d 
be a hell of a lot of pressure in the 
shock wave ahead of Ganymede. 
And heat.” 

“Difficult to add up?” 

“What?” 

Skatholtz said, “The numbers of 
the heat made by a grazing fall 
should be simple. They knew the 
mass of Ganymede and the height 
of the fall. The Girls could add up 
just how much hotter Jupiter would 
become to warm the world just 
enough. But. The heat made by fu- 
sion is too complicated to add. The 
Girls made their numbers simple 
with the grazing orbit. Would the 
heat added be great?” 

Corbell was nodding. “Look: the 
center of Jupiter is compressed hy- 
drogen, really compressed, to where 
it acts like a metal. Ganymede 
drops straight in. The fusion goes 
on in the shock wave, and it adds, 
it builds up: the continuous fusion 
explosion makes the shock wave 
greater and greater. The heat from 

111 




that explosion has been leaking out 
ever since.” 

‘‘I can’t picture this, Corbell. 
Does it make sense to you?” 

“Yeah. They lost a moon, and it 
killed them. Uranus was on its way 
into interplanetary space. The Girls 
couldn’t bring it back in time. Their 
territory was too hot. They tried to 
take Boy territory.” 

Corbell became aware that the 
show had ended. New memories 
settling in his brain still dizzied 
him. But he still felt like Jaybee 
Corbell. His personality seemed in- 
tact. 

Skatholtz said, “Then the new 
moon-like object is Uranus. Some 
Girls must have survived. What can 
we do? We don’t have spacecraft. 
We can’t build them fast enough. 
Corbell, could we use your landing 
craft?” 

“No fuel.” Corbell laughed sud- 
denly. “What would you do with a 
spacecraft? Ram Uranus? Or learn 
to fly it?” 

“You’re hiding something.” 

“I don’t believe in your Girls. If 
they survived this long, they would 
have done something long ago.” 
Uranus’s arrival was too dra- 
matically fortuitous. Such a coinci- 
dence had to be explained away; 
and Corbell had thought of an 
explanation. Well ... try misdirec- 
tion. 

“Could they have held out in the 
Himalayas? There’s life in some of 
the high valleys. They’d be a long 
time building industry there.” 

“Your place names mean noth- 
ing.” Skatholtz helped him stand 
up. “Can you point out this 
Himalayas place on a picture of the 
world? There was one downstairs.” 

112 



DIAL AT RANDOM 
I 

The stairway was a long diagonal 
across the building’s glass face. The 
bannister jogged to horizontal at six 
landings; otherwise it ran straight 
down to the admissions room. 

Skatholtz and Krayhayft spat 
Boyish at each other. Corbell 
caujght some of the detail: Skatholtz 
telling the tale as it had come from 
Corbell, Krayhayft checking it 
against “tales’’ memorized over 
several hundred years of life. There 
was something Italian in the way 
their hands jumped and their mouths 
spat syllables; but their faces were 
blank. Scared, Corbell thought. The 
“tales” matched too well. 

Corbell tried to set his thoughts 
in order. He’d been given far too 
much to assimilate all at once. 

Girls could have survived this 
long. Peerssa had found pockets of 
life in isolated places. But they 
would have acted! Unbelievable, 
that Corbell could have returned just 
in time for their million-year- 
delayed vengeance. Which meant — 

He had to escape. It had been ur- 
gent. It was more urgent now. 
Could Boys slide down a bannister? 
Unlikely that they’d ever practiced. 
But Corbell hadn’t practiced re- 
cently . 

“They were fools,” Krayhayft 
was saying. “They should have 
chosen several smaller moons to 
drop one by one.” 

“You’re the fool,” Corbell 
snapped, surprising himself. “It 
would have taken too long to bring 
Uranus back each time. It would 
have fouled up too many orbits. 

GALAXY 




We’re talking about a planet ten 
times as big as this world!” 

“So big that the Girls lost track 
of its path,” Krayhayft sneered. 

Skatholtz was saying, “The 
dance of Jupiter’s moons is very 
complex — ” 

While Corbell was saying, “You 
arrogant ball-less idiot — 

Casual, contemptuous, Kray- 
hayft’ s backhand swipe caught him 
under the jaw and lifted him and 
flung him back on the steps. “The 
bottled memory has given you too 
much of the Girls’ view,” 
Krayhayft said. 

“And whose fault is that?’’ 

Skatholtz pulled Corbell to his 
feet. His elbow hurt furiously, but 
he thought he hadn’t broken any- 
thing, and that was fiercely impor- 
tant now. Still, it was just as well 
he hadn’t tried the bannister. Two 
Boys were waiting below them in 
the admissions room. 

They waited for the leaders to de- 
scend. One was young, two or three 
Jupiter years old by Corbell’s esti- 
mate. He burst into speech as if he 
wanted to get it over with; 

“Gording is still loose. He has 
not used a prilatsil. The thread he 
took was mine. He must have 
brushed against me and taken it 
from my belt. I didn’t notice.” 

“Where is he?” Skatholtz de- 
manded. 

“He went north and east, until 
we lost his track. Toward the edge 
of Parhalding.” 

“It may be he doesn’t know 
about the — ” something Corbell 
couldn’t catch. “Search the streets 
but not the buildings. That way he 
cannot trap you with thread. He 
may be trying to reach the dikta 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



place on foot. We can stop him 
then. Or he may try to take a 
tchiple — ” an unfamiliar word. 
“Look for undamaged tchiples. 
Damage them. Tell the others.’’ 

The younger Boy ran, eager to be 
gone. 

What was a tchiplel A bubble- 
car? How did the Boys know 
whether Gording had used a “phone 
booth”? 

“You must retrace our path,” 
Skatholtz told the other Boy. 
“Warn all you meet that dikt is 
loose. Gording must not return to 
the dikta place.” He wheeled sud- 
denly and barked, “You are staring, 
Corbell. Do we fascinate you?” 
“Very much. Couldn’t Gording 
use a prilatsil without your know- 
ing?” 

“No.” Skatholtz smiled. He 
pointed at the wall map. “That is a 
picture of the world, isn’t it? An 
old one, made when ice stiU cov- 
ered this land.” 

“Yes. Can I use your spear?” 
That was sheer bravado; he 
wanted to see what would happen. 
What happened was that Skatholtz 
handed Corbell his spear. The 
younger Boys were gone, but 
Skatholtz and Krayhayft betrayed no 
obvious tension . Corbell pointed 
with the haft. “These -are the 
Himalayas, mountains. There are 
valleys high up, where it is cooler. 
From orbit I saw green things grow- 
ing there. Further north, here on the 
Sea of Okhotsk, energy is being 
used for industry. It may be only 
machines left running, but — ” 

“It could be Girls. Would it be 
too hot for them? No, the pole is 
near enough. But you don’t think 
so, Corbell.” 



113 




“No. Why would they wait so 
long? How would they build space- 
ships?” 

^‘We don’t know how spaceships 
are built.” Skatholtz looked through 
the broken picture window, toward 
where the new planet would appear 
at dark. 

“If Uranus is falling free, we can 
do nothing. If the Girls are guiding 
it . what will they do? Smash 
the world? Make it cold again and 
take back their land? You knew 
Girls, Corbell.” 

“I knew dikta women.” 

“There may be Girls still in the 
world. We can threaten 
them ... or can we? Uranus will 
be upon us before we can reach 
these places. Krayhayft — ” 

Far down the street, Corbell 
caught motion. “Your spear,” he 
said, holding it out. 

Skatholtz turned to take the 
spear. In that position he missed 
seeing what Corbell saw: a bubble- 
car skimming trees at ninety miles 
per hour, dropping and slowing. 

Krayhayft must have caught 
something in Corbell’s face. He ran 
forward, crying, “Alert!” 

Startled, Skaftoltz glanced back. 

Corbell jumped out the window. 

The Boys had quick reactions. As 
Corbell crossed the splinters of 
glass a spear haft rapped his ankles 
hard, threw him off balance. He 
curled tight and hugged his knees. 
Instead of landing on his head he 
fell on his shoulders in high com. 
Skatholtz was coming through the 
window in a graceful swan dive. 
Corbell rolled, found his feet and 
ran. 

Krayhaft threw his machete. It 
slashed viciously at Corbell’s calves 

114 



as it spun past. Krayhayft screamed, 
“Stop or ^e!” 

Skatholtz barked from close be- 
hind him. “Veto! He knows some- 
thing!” 

Corbell dug in. 

The bubble-car had stopped just 
at the entrance. Through the torn 
vines that still wrapped it Corbell 
saw white hair and white beard. 
Gording reached across to open the 
door. He was holding a stick 
against the door post. Why? 

Hell with it. He threw himself in, 
thrashed to turn around. 

Skatholtz was right there — gaping 
in horror, skidding to a panic stop. 
Corbell slammed the door in his 
face. Then he realised that Gording 
must have strung thread across the 
door. It might have cut his hand 
off. Hell with that too. “Go!” 

“I don’t know the codes,” said 
Gording. 

“Oh, for — ” Corbell jabbed five 
times at the compressed hour-glass 
figure. It was the first thing he 
thought of, and it was good enough: 
the World Police Headquarters in 
Sarash-Zillish. 

The car surged away. 

Corbell looked back . straight 
into Skatholtz’s eyes, before the 
Boy prudently dropped from the 
car. He’d lost his spear. It should 
have been lying in the street behind 
him, but it wasn’t. 

Blood was running from Cor- 
bell’s calves into the spongy stuff 
that lined the car’s interior. Nothing 
he could do about it. He didn’t even 
have clean cloth to bind his cuts. 
They stung. 

Gording said, “Wind the thread 
around the rock. Do it now, before 
you cut yourself.” 



GAIAXY 




Corbell obeyed. The thread was 
thin as cobweb, hard to find. He 
was careful. The car jerked to left 
and right, dodging bushes, trees, 
random rubble. 

II 

He had fled from the Nom in a 
car that was deathly silent except 
for the wind. But now he heard a 
low, almost subliminal whine. 
“How old is this — tchiple? Was it 
in good shape? I didn’t think to 
ask.” 

“I don’t repair tchiples. They 
must have safety devices. The Boys 
who built them expected to live 
forever. Where are we going?” 

“Sarash-Zillish, where the Boys 
spend the long night. It’s got 
machines we can use, maybe. Next 
question is, does it have Boys?” 

“Not yet, I think. I don’t really 
know.” 

“We’ll have to risk it. My 
God!” Corbell was staring at some- 
thing that could have meant his 
death by stupidity. 

“I never thought of it at all. I 
didn’t have a credit disk. How was 
I going to run a car?” He asked, 
“How did you happen to have 
one?” 

“The tales tell that name coins 
were used when the Girls ruled. I 
reasoned that when the land thawed 
the bodies of the dead would be 
buried outside the city to make the 
land fertile. There I fled, and there 
I dug, and I was right. Boys and 
Girls must have died by the 
thousand when the Girls came. I 
found bones and bones all tangled 
together, and some wore clothes, 
and in the clothes I found name 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



coins. I tried them in the slot of a 
tchiple. One coin still kept its pat- 
tern.” He regarded Corbell dubi- 
ously. “You did not remember that 
you would need a name coin?” 
Corbell flushed. “There was a lot 
to think about.” 

“I might have been luckier in my 
ally.” 

“I guess. Thanks for coming 
back for me.” 

“I had to, because you made 
another mistake. Does this car guide 
itself?” 

The car’s motion had settled 
down. Now Corbell saw that they 
had left Parhalding and were skim- 
ming across an endless rippling 
field of wheat. He said, “Unless 
Skatholtz’s spear . yeah, it 
guides itself.” 

‘ ‘Then look at my hair. ’ ’ 

There was nothing at all peculiar 
about Gording’s hair. It had grown 
a little tangled, a little greasy, but it 
was uniformly white . five days 
after the cat-tail had bitten Gording. 

Gording broke an embarrassed si- 
lence. “Will I go back to the dikta? 
Will I tell them that there is dikta 
immortality, but Corbell has lost it? 
We have to find it, Corbell.” 

“I don’t believe it. The cat-tails 
weren’t ... I don’t believe it! 
Damn it, Gording, there was no 
kind of injection except that cat-tail 
bite!” 

“Something you ate or drank or 
inhaled. You may have felt odd af- 
terward. Sick. Elated. Disoriented.” 
“Getting old is more complicated 
than that. There are . Do yoi/ 
know how people get old?” 

Gording sprawled comfortably in 
his seat, facing Corbell. The old 
man showed no sense of urgency. 

115 




“If I knew everything about aging I 
would make dikta immortality. I 
know general things. Substances 
build up in the body like ... the 
ashes of a dying fire. Some the 
body can handle without help. It 
collects them into garbage places 
for storage and ejects them. Some 
harmful stuff can be removed from 
the walls of blood vessels and the 
tissues of the brain by the right 
medicines. Dust and smoke that col- 
lects in the lungs can be washed 
away. Without the hospital we 
would die much faster. 

“But some . .ashes collect in 
the smallest living parts of the 
body. No organ can remove them. I 
can imagine a chemical, a 
medicine, that would change these 
substances to other substances that 
dissolve more easily, without killing 
the—” 

“Without killing the cell. You’re 
just guessing, aren’t you? We know 
there’s dikta immortality, but we 
don’t know how it does what it 
does. How does a Boy’s body do 
it?” 

Gording gestured negation: a 
brushing stroke with the hand. 
“That’s the wrong line of thought. 
Dikta immortality came first. It 
must be more primitive, less indi- 
rect. — Corbell, relax. Nothing can 
happen until the tchiple stops. We 
should rest.” 

“I feel a strong urge to beat my 
head against something hard. When 
I think of how I pushed you into 
jumping me and then threw a cat- 
tail in your face, teeth first . .” 
He didn’t know Boyish for I’m 
sorry. 

“How oddly you think. You 
know what you expected. Young 

116 



and strong and black-haired Cording 
would throw his arms around your 
knees and cry wetly into your in- 
credibly hairy chest and offer you 
his women ...” Gording laughed. 
“Yes, I know you think that way. 
No, they are not my women. They 
are their own, and I am my own, as 
and when the Boys let us rule our- 
selves. Do you remember how the 
women acted when you spoke of 
one man to every woman?’ ’ 

“Ah . vaguely.” 

“You must have lived strangely. 
Don’t you know that there are times 
when a woman doesn’t want a man? 
What does he do then? Borrow a 
woman whose contract is to another 
man?” Gording was thoroughly 
amused. 

And his relaxation was conta- 
gious. Corbell settled himself lower 
in the recline chair. He said, 
“You’ll find out, if we get our 
dikta immortality.” 

Gording looked startled. “I think 
you’re right. We would have to free 
ourselves from the Boys. Raise our 
boy-children to immortal adults. 
Slowly the number of women to 
each man would drop toward one. 
But — ” He smiled. “It would take 
centuries.” 

They could see the rain sweeping 
toward them across the wheat. It 
exploded against the front of the 
car. Against the thunder of the rain 
Corbell raised his voice: 

“Have you ever tried to escape?” 
“We sent scouts. Many were 
dikta men in their second year, 
come recently from rejection by the 
Boys. They were too young to be 
wise, of course, but they could 
shave their groins and faces and 
pass as Boys. Some were brought 

GALAXY 




back with their memories gone. I 
think the others would have re- 
turned if they could. Some women 
tried to scout for us during the long 
night. None of them came back.” 

The rain drummed out the hum of 
the motor. Corbell asked, “Did you 
ever think of escaping by sea?’ ’ 

“Of course, but how could we 
hide a sea vessel from the Boys? 
Corbell, you’ve been across the sea. 
Is there land? Does life grow there, 
or is it too hot?” 

“There’s life, but it doesn’t grow 
as thick as it does here, and it’s dif- 
ferent life. I know you can eat some 
of it, because Mirelly-Lyra fed me a 
fair variety. It was hot there, but 
not killing-hot. And, listen. I’ve 
seen sea vessels big enough to hold 
all of Dikta City, l^ether they still 
float is something else.” 

“Where?” 

“On what used to be the sea bed, 
a short day’s march from where the 
sea is now.” 

Cording mulled it over. “Three 
problems. Getting the sea vessel to 
the sea. The risk we take if the 
Boys catch us at it. Third and 
worst, what will we tell our men 
when they are grown? That we stole 
them from immortality? If we find 
the dikta immortality, Corbell, we 
can make the dikta flee to Four 
City.” 

“It itches at me. I had it all fig- 
ured out. Brilliantly! Everything 
pointed to the cat-tails. Listen, 
are you willing to be bitten again? 
Maybe it’s only the male cat-tails, 
or only the females, or only the 
grey striped. Whatever the Boys 
didn’t take along to the dikta 
place.” 

“Flay me alive if you must. The 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



stakes are high. You’d be dead long 
since if you didn’t guess right some- 
times.” 

Corbell settled further into the 
spongy material. The drumming 
rain was a comfortable, homey, safe 
sound. Presently he fell asleep. 

In his dream he was running, 
running. 

Ill 

Something threw him violently 
forward. Something soft exploded 
in his face and threw him back. 
Now pressure pinned him fast while 
he spun violently head over heels. 
He tried to get up and found he 
couldn’t so much as twitch a finger. 
He tried to scream and he couldn’t 
breath! 

Nightmare! Running down the 
hospital corridors, can’t get enough 
air — the booths in the vault! — don’t 
work. Out of the vault, searching 
for instant-elsewhere booths — turn a 
comer and — the Norn! Paralyzed 
even to his diaphragm and closed 
eyelids, his sense of balance gone 
crazy, he tries again to scream. The 
cane! 

But his scream blew air 
through . through the stuff 
across his face. He gasped, and 
some air leaked through, slowly. 
Porous stuff across his face. Right, 
and the hospital was long ago. 

The spinning stopped. He thought 
he was upside down. 

Let’s see, he’d been with Cord- 
ing ... in a car .. The pressure 
was easing up. He thrust forward 
with his hands. The stuff gave 
like ... a balloon. He worked an 
arm sideways, found the door, then 
the handle. Wrestled it open. He 

117 




squirmed against the porous bal- 
loon, edged sideways, and finally 
dropped out on his head. 

The car was upside down in wet, 
scraggy wheat. It had tom a clear 
path in its rolling fall. Cording was 
around in back looking at a broken 
spear haft that had b^een jammed 
under the edge of a close-fitting 
hood. 

“I knew there were safety de- 
vices,” he said cheerfully. 

Relief made Corbell babble. 
‘‘Too many Great Escapes lately. 
I’m getting them mixed up. Lord, 
what a nightmare! For a time there I 
thought I was back running from 
Mirelly-Lyra.” 

Cording looked at him. ‘‘She re- 
ally frightens you, the old dikt.” 
‘‘She really does. Worse than the 
Boys. There were some very hairy 
moments. The city was full of 
prilatsil, see, and you never knew 
where she’d be, or where I’d be. 
The best I could do was find a 
prilatsil and dial at random, over 
and over, and even then some of 
them didn’t work. And all the time 
she was tracking my pressure suit 
helmet! She’s probably still got it. 
At least ... I hope she does.” 
‘‘Why does it matter?” 

‘‘I’ll tell you as we go.” Corbell 
paused. ‘‘For a moment there . .” 
‘‘Something?” 

‘‘Something connected in my 
primitive brain and instandy got lost 
again. Never mind, it’ll come 
back.” Corbell sighted along the 
line tom through the wheat, then 
extended the line. ‘‘Sarash-Zillish is 
that way. I wish I knew how far.” 
There were nothing but rolling 
wheat fields to be seen. ‘‘When we 
come to forest, we’re close.” 



Cording carefully retrieved 
Skatholtz’s broken spear. He found 
the rock with the thread tied to it, 
found another rock and rebuilt his 
weapon. The tchiple’s safety bal- 
loons had nearly deflated. Cording 
felt around inside until he had lo- 
cated the plastic disk. 

The sun was a fiery flying saucer 
settling on clouds. They set out into 
the wet wheat, and Corbell began 
the tale of how the Girls had lost a 
moon. 

Toward morning they found a 
stream. 

Jupiter had lighted their way in 
horizontal orange beams that made 
the land look brighter than it was. 
Corbell walked into the water be- 
fore he knew it was there. The 
stream was shallow and sluggish. 
Marsh grass was growing in it, pos- 
sibly a mutant form of wheat or 
rice. 

Corbell knelt to drink. He rubbed 
his calves to wash away dried 
blood. When he looked up Cording 
held a flopping fish in his hands. 

‘‘Cording, you’re quick!” 

‘‘Dinner, such as it is — ” He was 
scaling the fish. 

‘‘Do we dare build a fire?” 

‘‘No, we must not be seen. 
We’re just the wrong number. We 
can’t pass as Boys at any distance. 
We’ll eat the fish raw.” 

‘‘No, thanks.” 

‘‘As you like.” 

The unwinking point of light had 
grown no brighter. Odd, that it 
could have come so fast. But 
Uranus had been nearing Jupiter in 
the random orbit the Girls had left it 
in, when Don Juan arrived in Sol 
system. He said as much to Cord- 
ing. 



118 



GALAXY 




Cording nodded his pale head. “I 
have not added the numbers, but I 
think the paths of Jupiter and 
Uranus must cross forever if it was 
left free after the Girls dropped 
Ganymede. But why would 
they let it free? They would have 
been t^ing to turn it, to correct 
their mistake.” 

“Maybe they heard there was a 
war. They took their ships home to 
bomb the Boys from orbit. They 
never came back.” 

Cording had eaten everything but 
the bones of the fish. He said, “It 
is unlikely that the Girls waited 
their revenge for your return. It is 
unlikely that Uranus, falling free, 
crosses the world’s path just after 
your return. I think your explana- 
tion is right. Corbel!. We must go 
to Four City and find the old dikt 
who has your pressure suit helmet. 
Otherwise we will see the end of all 
life.” 

“I was afraid you’d say that. All 
right. There’s a woiking tchiple in 
Sarash-Zillish. It took. me there 
firom Cape Horn. I wish I knew the 
code for getting back . but I 
don’t.” 

“Dial at random?” 

“Maybe. I’d like to check the 
subway system first. There are 
maps in the subway building.” He 
stood. “Let’s go.” 

★ ★ * 

Dawn came with a marrow- 
freezing roar. It whipped Corbell’s 
head around. He faced a dwarf lion, 
twenty yards away on a rise of 
ground, roaring challenge. 

Skatholtz’s broken spear slapped 
against his palm. “Attack!” cried 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Cording, and he charged the 
Great-Dane-sized beast. 

Corbell pelted after him. The lion 
seemed taken aback ... but he de- 
cided. He charged Cording. Some- 
how Cording danced aside. The lion 
turned, broadside to Corbell. Cor- 
bell threw all his weight behind the 
spear, leaned into it as it punched 
into the lion behind the ribs. The 
lion screamed, turned and slashed, 
and missed, because one of its 
forelegs was unaccountably missing. 
Cording did his trick again and boSi 
the lion’s forelegs were gone. 

“Now run!” Cording cried. 

They ran toward Sarash-Zillish. 
In the clear air they could see the 
bluish line where trees began. 
“Male lion . drives the 
prey . toward the female,” 
Cording panted. 

Corbell looked back and saw 
something wheat-colored bounding 
through the tall wheat. A glance at 
the old man made him say, “You’ll 
wear yourself . out. We’ll 
have ... to fight.” 

They stopped, blowing. 

The female’s caution gave them 
time to breathe. She stalked out of 
the wheat to find them facing her 
like the statues of athletes, eight 
feet apart. She roared. They didn’t 
flinch. She thought it over. She 
roared again. Corbell stood poised, 
confident, happy. 

The female departed. Twice she 
looked back, thought it over, and 
kept going. 

Corbell walked now with a silly 
smile plastered across his face. He 
couldn’t help it. Every time he let 
his face relax it came back. Any 
normal pair of men would have 
been bragging unmercifully; but 

119 




Cording clearly considered the inci- 
dent closed. He didn’t even show 
relief at Corbell’s compe- 
tence . which was flattering, in a 
w^. 

Finally Corbell said, “Real lions 
would have tom us up. Why are 
there so many small versions of big 
animals?’ ’ 

“Are there?” 

“Yeah. Lions, elephants, buffalo. 
There must have been about ten 
thousand Jupiter years of famine 
here, before the soil turned fertile. 
The big animals must have starved 
faster. Or maybe they died of heat 
prostration: too much volume, not 
enough surface.” 

“I believe you. I look at you and 
I see a different kind of dikt. We’ve 
had time to adapt to reddened sun- 
light and long days and long nights. 
Animals and plants and dik- 
ta . and Boys adapted through 
the dikta. If Uranus widens the 
world’s path now, it will all be 
lost.” 

“I know.” 

“Are you ready to face Mirelly- 
Lyra?” 

“Yeah.” Corbell shivered, 
though the morning was not espe- 
cially cool. It would get cooler. 
Corbell tried to visualize six years 
of night . and saw Mirelly-Lyra 
stalking him in the dark. “When we 
see her, maybe we can offer her 
dikta immortality. She’d do damn 
near anything for that.” 

“If we find it, my turn comes 
first.” 

Corbell laughed. “There’s bound 
to be enough. Otherwise it would 
have been . guarded.” 

“Why did you pause?” 

“Guarded. The hospital vault in 



Sarash-Zillish wasn’t guarded. Were 
the Boys that sure a dikt couldn’t 
get to it? It looked just like the 
other vault except for the guard sys- 
tems, the vault door and the one- 
way prilatsil and the armored glass 
cubicles in the roof. ’ ’ 

“What of it? What if one dikt or 
three found dikta immortality? The 
guarded chamber in Four City was 
protected from dikta by dikta who 
owned it. Or so you assumed.” 

“Uh uh. Four City was old, but 
not like Parhalding. More like 
Sarash-Zillish. I think the Boys 
built Four City.” 

The trees were closer now. Fruit 
trees. Corbell was hungry. He 
shrugged that off. He had the tail 
end of something. 

Ashes of a dying fire. Most of it 
comes out in the feces and 
urine . but not all of that; urea 
can build up in the joints aitd cause 
gout. Cholesterol can build up in 
the veins and arteries. But even 
when all these are washed 
away . there are still the inert 
molecules that accumulate in the 
cell itself. 

Picture the miracle that can re- 
move those. Now tell me what it 
looks like. 

“There was nothing to guard!” 

“I don’t under — ” 

“There was nothing to guard in 
Sarash-Zillish. I had it turned 
around. Heeeyaa/ I’ve got it! Dikta 
immortality 

Cording backed away a bit. 
“You had it once before. What 
fierce beast is to bite me this time?” 
“I don’t have to say. I made a 
fool of myself once. Not this time. 
Come on.” The trees were close 
and Corbell was hungry.

GALAXY 




IV 

Corbell walked alone through the 
streets of Sarash-Zillish. His face 
itched. His scalp itched. His chest 
itched. He was trying to ignore an 
acid stomach. 

How did loners walk? He’d seen 
only one loner close enough to tell. 
That one had been certain of wel- 
come; his walk had been springy 
and confident. Boyish. Corbell tried 
to keep his walk springy and confi- 
dent. 

The windows of Sarash-Zillish 
were dark. The streets were empty 
and silent. This whole charade 
could turn out to be unnecessary, 
itches and all . 

They had filled their bellies with 
fruit in the forest outside Sarash- 
Zillish. There Corbell had used the 
head of the broken spear to shave 
his face and his chest and four 
inches of his scalp around a 
topknot. Cording had cut away his 
long white hair. Cording had 
shaved too, for all the good that 
would do; there where white-haired 
albino Boys, but they didn’t move 
like their joints hurt. 

Laughing, joking Boys spilled out 
of a probable department store. 
Corbell turned a corner to avoid 
them, just like- a loner would, 
maybe. At a distance he should pass 
as a loner. Close up, no chance. 
Dikta immortality be damned, he 
was no twelve-year-old. He wished 
Cording were beside him; but that 
would have tom it. Two was just 
the wrong number to pass. 

The brush clogging the street 
thickened. Corbell waded into it. 
Here were tangled vines rising to a 



wall, roughly straight. Corbell 
turned along its length. 

The wall, he found, had a gentle 
curve to it. Probably it formed a 
circle or an ellipse. Here there was 
a break, and near the break the 
shrubbery thickened and grew taller, 
as if the Park spilled out through 
the opening. Corbell passed it and 
kept going. There were park 
sounds: tree limbs rustling in the 
breeze, small birds whistling, a 
sudden loud squawk followed by 
(Corbell jumped) a burst of laugh- 
ter. Boys! Boys on the other side of 
the wall. And the wall opened 
ahead of him. 

Beyond the opening, a twelve 
foot Christmas ornament floated 
above knee-deep vines. 

Corbell thought it through. Then, 
within sight of the car, he began 
searching for a straight sapling. 
Most of the bushes were of the 
wrong kind, but he found one that 
would do, even if it was a bit short. 
He hacked at the base with the 
truncated spear until he could break 
it loose. He sat down cross- 



legged— 
What V 



What was keeping Cording? 

Cording was well behind him, 
tracking him. If anyone noticed, 
two loners happened to be moving 
in the same direction, their target a 
reasonable one: the park. 

Squatting cross-legged, Cording 
disengaged the spearhead from the 
broken haft and used it to shave the 



sapling. He barely glanced up as 
Boys came wading through the 
tangle in what had been a pa^ gate: 
two, five, ten Boys with a giant 
turkey carcass slung on poles. 
Where were they going with that? A 
kitchen in a nearby building? Ef- 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



121 




fete, that was. He heard a louder 
voice followed by a pause, and, 
judging that he had been hailed, he 
glanced up, held a grinning Boy’s 
eye for a moment, then deliberately 
went back to his work. Couldn’t 
they see he was alone? A loner 
would damn well make the first 
overtures, as and when he felt like 
it, maybe. 

The new haft was shaping nicely. 
He tried the end against the 
spearhead. A bit too big. He’d 
shave it down a little and carve a 
notch and wedge it in. The rustling 
of the Boys diminished, moving 
across the street, but two quiet, 
puzzled voices were speaking too 
near him. He glanced up under 
lowered brows. 

They were near, and looking at 
him as they talked. The car was — 
Cording was crouched behind the 
car! 

How had he gotten there? Corbell 
hadn’t heard a sound. He must have 
spotted the car, gone over the wall, 
circled inside the Park and gone 
over the wall again. Now he 
crouched, immobile, but looking 
guilty as hell if anyone should see 
him. 

The tall Boy with hair like a 
black puffball hailed Corbell again. 
“Perfunctory apologies because we 
interrupt. May we examine your 
work?’’ 

Corbell unfolded his legs and 
slowly stood up and sprinted for the 
car. 

The door was open as he had left 
it. By that much did the Boys fail 
to intercept him. Cording was ahead 
of him, sliding in the other door. 
Corbell slammed his door and clung 
to the handle, leaning back to hold 

122 



it shut, while Cording jabbed at the 
ke^^ard. 

The black-haired Boy ran 
alongside, pulling at the door, for 
longer than Corbell would have be- 
lieved possible. Finally he dropped 
away. 

“You said four of anything,’’ 
said Cording. “I pushed that.’’ 
Crossed commas. 

“I don’t know where that takes 
us. Let’s see if we can change it.’’ 
He jabbed four times at the crooked 
pi. “I don’t even know if there is a 
subway terminal here. There’s no 
giant cube. Everywhere else it was 
a giant cube.’’ 

“Rest. If we don’t find the sub- 
way we still have a tchiple. Dial at 
random.’’ 

“I lost my spear.’’ 

“I still have the thread.’’ 

“That’s not what I meant. I 
thought I was repmring it right. But 
the way those Boys acted — Skip 
it.’’ 

On their crooked run through die 
city they saw only one other Boy. 
On the wreck of a skyscraper near 
the city’s center, a lean and ragged 
loner was mountain-climbing three 
stories up. As the tchiple zipped 
beneath him his sunken eyes locked 
on Corbell’s and held them until the 
tchiple turned a comer. 

With the big dark still an Olde 
Earth year away, one loner and the 
two bands near the park might well 
be the total population of Sarash- 
Zillish. It would be nice to think 
so . but stupid. Sarash-Zillish 
was too important not to be on that 
pattern of close-spaced “phone 
booths’’. Corbell said, “Some of 
Krayhayft’s Tribe probably got here 
ahead of us.” 



GALAXY 




“They won’t know where we’re 
will they?” 

ey don’t know why we want 
to get to Cape Horn. I’d hate to un- 
derestimate them.” 

The car slowed and settled, bend- 
ing shrubbery, and stopped. They 
got out. Cording asked, “Where are 
we?” 

The sparse greenery in the street 
thickened to jungle as it climbed the 
slope to their right. Corbell sprang 
to the rounded top of the tchiple. 
The patch of citrus jungle was unna- 
turally flat and rectangular. Some of 
the trees looked very old. 

“I don’t know.” 

“But why did the tchiple bring us 
here? Where is the subway?” 

“It’d be towering over our heads. 
Every city I’ve seen, the subway 
building was a tremendous cube.” 

Cording joined him on the car. 
Together they surveyed the rectan- 
gle of jungle. 

“But a subway is below 
ground,’’ Cording said. “Why 
would it need to be so high?” 

“I never found out what was in 
the upper stories. Maybe places of 
government, or offices for rent.” 

“Maybe they left it off this 
time.” 

The patch of jungle was about as 
wide as the great cubes in One City 
and Four city. Corbell said, “Could 
be. They put a park on it instead. 
Hien the ice cap thawed and a lot 
of dead dust fell all over every- 
thing.” Where did they put the en- 
trances, though? Escalators in the 
center? No, the trees grew thickest 
there. 

Where the ground sloped up from 
the street, there in mid-slope was a 
dip. Water pooled there, forming a 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



small, dirty, weed-grown pond. 
Corbell expressed himself under his 
breath. 

“I don’t know those words,” 
said Cording. 

Corbell pointed. “Under the 
weeds and die water and the scum 
and the mud, that’s where we’ll 
find steps leading down to the 
doors. After we dig it out. After we 
find shovels and dig all that stuff 
but of there. Then we get to find 
out if anything still woilu under all 
that.” 

“No.” 

“No?” 

“They won’t let us.” 

The shaip-faced loner was trot- 
ting toward them from across the 
wide street. He carried an oddly 
curved broad-bladed sword. Well 
behind him, other Boys spilled out 
of a building. 

“Do you think you can take him 
with your rocks?’ ’ 

“No,” said Cording. “He’s 
ready. He knows we’re dangerous. 
He’ll catch the thread on his 
blade.” 

“Into the car, then.” They clam- 
bered down and in. In frustration 
Corbell demanded, “How did they 
get here so fasti” 

“Not by car. Are there prilatsil 
in Sarash-Zillish?” 

“Oh, sure, that’s how they did 
it.” 

“Can we use prilatsill” 

“Yeah. Yeah! We won’t have to 
dig! Assuming the damn things still 
work. The subway hasn’t been 
maintained.” 

The loner was very close now. 
Corbell dialed a numter he remem- 
bered: two commas crossed, S re- 
versed, hourglass on its side, 

123 





crooked Pi. The car sped smoothly 
away. Eleven Boys watched it go. 

“They tracked us somehow. 
They’ll track us again,’’ Corbell 
said. “We’ll have some time, but 
not much.” 

# * * 

From outside it was a copy of the 
office building in which Mirelly- 
Lyra had returned Corbell’s pressure 
suit. In this version the elevators 
worked. Still following the pattern, 
CcM-bell tried the third floor. 

It held. Lines of office doors, all 
closed. 

“My name coin doesn’t open 
them,” Cording reported. 

They kicked at a door. It was 
solid. 

Cording asked, “Are there prilat- 
sil not locked behind doors?’ ’ 

“Yeah. On the roof. The Boys 
could be there by now.” 

“Did you at least keep the spear 
blade?” 

Corbell handed it over. Then it 
occurred to him that there might be 
indicators for the elevators. He 
slipped back into the elevator and 
punched all the buttons. If it 
stopped on every floor they’d have 
to check them all. He got out on the 
fourth floor. As he tiptoed down he 
heard a pattering above him like a 
swarm of rats. 

Cording had disengaged the 
thread from the rocks. He had tied 
one end to the blade and the other 
to his loincloth. Now he chopped 
with the blade at the cloud-rug 
where it ran beneath an office door. 
“Cuard the stairs,” he said. 

“With what?” 

Cording didn’t answer, didn’t 
even look up. 

124 



Corbell stood barehanded at the 
stairwell door. The first Boy 
through would kill him. He knew it. 
Maybe Cording would get away. 

\^at was Cording doing? 

Cording was pushing the blade 
under the door with his fingers. 

He pulled upward on the ends of 
the loincloth. He heaved. Sounds 
forced their way between his teeth. 

Now he pulled sideways toward 
the doorjamb. 

Now he kicked at the door. It 
shuddered. Another kick sent it 
crashing inward. The blade was 
stronger than the door; the thread 
had cut the metal around the lock. 

Through the office window Cor- 
bell glimpsed two Boys working 
under the tchiple’s motor hatch. 
Then he crowded into the “phone 
booth” with Cording. When he shut 
the door there was no light. He 
opened the door a crack, found the 
crooked pi and kept his finger on it 
as he closed the door. He pushed it 
four times. 

Nothing obvious happened. 

He opened the door and slipped 
out into a blackness like the inside 
of a stomach. “Figures,” he whis- 
pered. “We’ll have to bet that this 
is really a subway. Stay here. I’ll 
find the stairs and call you.” 

“Cood,” said Cording. Corbell 
slipped away. 

He moved with his hand lightly 
brushing the wall. Once he found a 
cloud-rug couch by stumbling over 
it. He clutched at the stuff to stop 
his fall, and a sheet of cloud-rug 
ripped away in his hand. Rotted. 

A sound behind him. He said, 
“What was that?” 

Cording didn’t answer. 

Corbell kept moving. He could 

GALAXY| 




feel Mirelly-Lyra in the dark. He 
kept expecting the stairs, but the 
wall went on and on. He circled 
another couch and kept going. 
There was no sound in this place. 
Cloud-rug cushioned his feet and 
blotted up the sound of his breath- 
ing. 

Stairs! 

“Here,” he said, not in a whis- 
per. 

“Good,” Cording said from a 
foot away. Corbell jumped like a 
man electrocuted. “A Boy stalked 
you until I killed him with thread. I 
think it must have been the loner, 
from his smell.” 

“This place may be dead. If the 
stairs — ah.” The stairs moved be- 
neath him. Disoriented, off balance, 
he sat down to let the stairs carry 
him down into the darkness. 

The stairs stopped. Cording said, 
“What next?” 

“Follow the sound of my voice. I 
know where the cars are; all the 
way in the back.” He walked with 
his hands in front of him. How was 
he going to find the right car? 

He felt his way around cloud-rug 
couches. 

He brushed a solid wall. Off 
course. He couldn’t hear Cord- 
ing ... or anything else. Were 
there Boys in the dark, stalking him 
as Cording stalked them? Was 
Cording already dead? Corbell was 
moving too fast, stumbling. Only 
the very oldest Boys would know 
the layout of this place; but they 
wouldn’t need to. They’d follow 
him by his breathing. 

He had found the doors. 

“Cording!” 

Light flashed for an instant at the 
far end. Where had that come from? 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Cording called, “All right.” 

Cor^ll waited in the dark and 
the quiet. Presently Cording spoke 
next to him — “Here.” — felt for 
Corbell’ s hand and put something 
heavy in it. “I robbed the loner. 
Take his sword. I took his fire start- 
er too. Where is the picture of the 
world?’ ’ 

“Along — ” Corbell guided Cord- 
ing’ s hand. “ — that wall.” 

The flashlight beam revealed two 
polar projections with the ice caps 
still showing. There were no glow- 
ing lights or numbers to mark the 
routes. 

Cording asked, “Which is our 
door?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“The Boys have our tchiple. We 
can’t surrender because we’ve killed 
the loner. The Boys may have a 
way to shut down the prilatsil. Do 
something, Corbell.” 

“All right. Give me the name 
coin.” He took it, inserted it in the 
ticket window. Nothing happened. 

He tried the next door. Nothing. 
He was beginning to panic. But the 
stairs had worked — 

The third door let them through. 
The transparent door to the subway 
car let Cording through, closed after 
him, and wouldn’t open until Cor- 
bell had pulled the disk out and re- 
inserted it. They sat down opposite 
each other. 

“Now we sit here for awhile.” 

“All right.” 

“I don’t know how you can be 
so calm.” 

“I risk less than you do. Half a 
Jupiter year — ” He had borrowed 
Corbell’s phrase — “and I’ll be 
dead. Against this I balance dikta 
immortality and freedom from the 

125 




Boy rule. Unless . Corbell, can 
we find dikta immortality where 
we’re going? Or will we have to 
make constant raids on Antarctica?” 

“I know it’s in Four City. Maybe 
it’s in other places too.” 

“The risk is good. Shall we 
slera?” 

Corbell’s laugh was shaky. 
“Good luck.” 

V 

Gording woke when the door 
went up. The car slid into the vac- 
uum tunnel; curved downward; 
straightened out; rolled right; rolled 
left. So far so good. 

Gording, watching his face, re- 
laxed. “I did not want to ask. 
Where are we going?” 

“It doesn’t matter. Anywhere 
there’s a . picture of the world 
that lights up. That’ll tell us how to 
get to Four City.” 

“A good decision,” said Gord- 
ing, and he went back to sleep. 

Maybe he was faking. 

But his breathing was very gentle 
and regular. 

Corbell stretched out. He wedged 
his ankles under a chair arm. There 
was no sound but Gording’s breath- 
ing. 

Corbell dozed. He twitched and 
jerked in his sleep: running, run- 
ning . When the car turned up- 
ward he came half-awake, then 
dropped off again. But he felt it 
when the Car slowed, and, groggy 
as he was, he remembered that first 
ride. He put his hands over his ears, 
turned to see Gording copy him. 

The car stopped. 

Doors popped open automati- 
cally. Air puffed across them, hot 

126 



and wet, like boiling mapfe syrup in 
the throat. Corbell cried, “Come 
on!” and went through. 

The great hall was a ruin. Six or 
seven stories of the great cube had 
fallen in, leaving a cross section of 
whatever was up there; Corbell 
didn’t care. He kept his breathing 
shallow. The scalding air was thick 
with a taste and smeU half chemi- 
cal, half mildew. Sweat sprang out 
in droplets all over his body. 

The wall map was cracked 
across, and dark. 

He tried his credit lens in three 
doors before he found one that 
worked. Gording pulled at his arm 
and spoke like a man holding his 
breath. “Wait! Where does this 
go?” 

“Come on.” 

They entered the subway car. It 
didn’t help. You can die locked in a 
steam room, Corbell thought. He 
stretched out on the row of seats. 
“Mirelly-Lyra rigged the subway 
system to t^e anyone from the hot 
part of the world straight to her. We 
can hope she didn’t skip this termi- 
nal. Lie still and don’t try to exer- 
cise. Breath shallow.” 

He lay on his back and waited. 
The sweat tickled as it ran down his 
ribs,- but he didn’t wipe at it. 

Something ticked on. Air blew 
across him, too warm, and then 
cooling. Corbell sighed. “It sensed 
the CO2,” he told himself. The air 
grew cool, cool. 

A long time later Gording said, 
“I left the fire starter.” 

“Damn.” 

Silence, then, until the door went 
up. 

There were the usual surges, then 
the ride straightened out. Corbell 

GALAXY 




tried to sleep again, but something 
was holding him back. He didn’t 
know what it was until Cording 
said, “My ears hurt.” 

That was it. “The car leaks,” 
said Corbell. “Just a chance we had 
to take. Let’s hope we’ve got 
enough air to get to Ae end.” 

“It hurts. Can I do anything?” 
Hey, Cording had never bren in 
an airplane! Corbell said, “Work 
your jaws.” He demonstrated. His 
ears popped. 

* * * 

The car slowed, slowed. It had 
come sooner than Corbell had ex- 
pected; but they were both panting, 
and Cording was uneasy. Corbell 
felt guilty satisfaction. It took a lot 
of unknown danger to disturb Cord- 
ing. 

He covered his ears with his 
hands and opened his jaws wide, 
and waited for Cording to do the 
same. His skin was clammy. He 
was unbearably tense. 

The doors poj^d open. The air 
that slapped across them was only 
warm. Through the door he saw 
lights dim at the back, cloud-rug 
humping into couches. He reached 
for the loner’s broad-bladed scim- 
itar. 

Motion flickered in the gate. 
Corbell’s brain flashed: Mirelly- 
Lyra! Too soon! He pulled the car 
door shut as something darted 
through the gate. He had what she 
wanted — they could negotiate — 

It was Krayhayft! The grey-haired 
Boy stopped short. He looked at 
them through the glass. 

He raised the fire starter. 

Cording threw himself back to- 
ward the inadequate protection of 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



the toilet. Corbell sensed it; but he 
himself was frozen. 

Krayhayft fired past him. Light 
blazed behind Corbell, and he 
smelled chemical smoke as part of 
the couch burned. Krayhayft shouted, 
“Come out. Or I’ll bum off your 
feet.” 

Corbell’ s hand was still on the 
door. But ... “I can’t do it. You’d 
chop down the Tree of Life.” 

For an instant Krayhayft was 
puzzled. Then, “That’s not what 
we want. We only want to know 
where it is. Corbell, suppose a di- 
saster wiped out most of the dikta, 
and the only survivors were half a 
dozen old ones? We could keep 
them young and breeding.” 

“Meanwhile they never get a 
smell of it.” 

Flame burst from the rug beside 
Corbell’s right foot. Krayhayft said, 
“We need your pressure suit helmet 
too. Speaking of disasters — ” and 
Krayhayft’ s face changed. 

Corbell had never seen that look 
on any Boy. It frightened him. 
Cuilt and remorse and fear. 
Krayhayft moaned, the sound faint 
through the glass. His eyes darted 
left and right, seeking . escape? 

He found it. Brighter than hu- 
man, he found it at once, and used 
it. Krayhayft raised the fire starter 
to his head and fired. Flame burst 
from that side of his head, then 
from the other. Krayhayft fell, and 
kicked spasmodically, and lay still. 

Corbell spared himself one flick- 
ing glance back. Cording was still 
hidden, crouched behind the toilet 
door. 

Then Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar 
stepped through the gate. Shapeless 
robe, white touched with irrides- 

127 




cence, and a withered face within: 
the bright eyes fixed on him, and 
then the cane. 

“Mirelly-Lyra! It’s me!” 

The shock almost killed her. He 
thought, he hoped she would faint. 
She recovered; she gestured 
peremptorily with the cane. Come 
out! 

He reached for the scimitar. She 
gave him just a touch of what had 
killed Krayhayft. Moaning, he came 
through. 

She sppke gibberish. An old 
man’s voice translated: ‘‘You found 
it. Where is it?” 

‘‘Give me the cane and I’ll tell 
you.” 

Her answer was a wave of guilt 
and mental agony. Corbell waded 
through it, hands outstretched for 
her throat. She backed away. Cor- 
bell moaned and came on. Suddenly 
she turned something on the cane’s 
handle. 

Sleep dragged him down toward 
the cloud-rug. Sleep and red rage 
warred in him. He was on his 
knees, but he waded toward her, 
two steps, three . 

Musty smell. 

Soft stuff cradling his cheek. 

Mirelly-Lyra was in one of the 
shapeless couches. 

Corbell got his arms under him 
and lifted himself out of the cloud- 
rug. He pulled himself toward her. 
She tried to cringe back without 
moving. Terrified. 

‘‘I caught her from behind,” said 
Cording. He was seated facing her, 
holding the silver cane. 

The old woman spoke rapidly. 
An old man’s voice translated, 
“You don’t dare kill me. I have 
something you want.” 

128 



Corbell got to his feet with some 
effort. “The pressure suit helmet,” 
he said. “Give it to me or I’ll let 
you live ... as you are.” 

Her mouth compressed. “Immor- 
tality first.” 

“How many settings are there on 
that cane?” 

“Five. Two that kill. Others 
might kill me. Can you find the 
helmet then?” 

“Probably.” Corbell smiled; he 
saw by her face that he was right. 
“But so what? I’ll make you 
young. Then I’ll kill you if I don’t 
get what I want.” He changed to 
Boyish. “Hold the cane ready. But 
I think she won’t try to escape now. 
We’re going to get dikta immortal- 
ity.” 

Cording looked dubious. 

* * *- 

Corbell wasn’t about to trust the 
Norn in a “phone booth”. They 
wedged themselves into a tchiple 
with Mirelly-Lyra between, for a 
cramped ride through Four City. As 
the car swerved and darted through 
glass and concrete rubble, Corbell 
wondered. Should he have forced 
the helmet from her first? 

Yes. But he couldn’t wait that 
long. He had to know. 

They unfolded themselves out of 
the car. Cording said, “I might 
have known it would be a hospi- 
tal.” 

“Did your hospital have 
a . guarded place on the third 
floor?” 

“No.” 

Mirelly-Lyra was looking up at 
the glass-mosaic face. “But I 
searched this place!” 



GAUXY 




“You were desperate, too,” Cor- 
bell said smugly. “You just weren’t 
desperate in the right way.” He led 
the way up the stairs. Dust puffed 
beneath their feet. At the third floor 
he found two sets of footprints to 
remind him of his panic flight 
through these halls. He glanced 
back; but Mirelly-Lyra seemed 
docile enough, and Cording was 
behind her with the cane. 

He turned into the hall- 
way . and was lost. “Mirelly- 
Lyra, where are the ‘phone 
booths’?” 

They found the line of prilatsil. 
A moment to orient himself: there 
was the comer where he’d been hid- 
ing when the Nom came to hunt 
him down. He led off . and here 
was the vault door, open. 

Cording said, “’They guarded 
their immortality well.” 

“Wouldn’t you?” Corbell 
pointed to the skeletons and the 
hole smashed high up in the wall. 
“But not well enough. We’re lucky 
they didn’t use it and then wreck it. 
Maybe they thought they’d be back 
in fifty years.” 

Cording looked around at the 
guard emplacements, the empty 
shelves, the computer console, the 
pair of “phone booths.” “Where is 
it, if they didn’t destroy it? Not 
through the prilatsil, unless the des- 
tination was equally well 
guarded.” 

“Through the prilatsil. Cive me 
the cane first.” 

Would Cording balk? He didn’t; 
he handed Corbell the weapon, then 
stepped forward to study the pair of 
glass booths. Only one had a door. 
He stepped inside. 

Mirelly-Lyra snarled something. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



The box translated: ‘ ‘Are you mock- 
ing me?” 

Corbell waved the cane under her 
nose. “Suppose I am?” 

She came at him with her fin- 
gernails. He didn’t bother with the 
trigger. He rapped her on the head 
with the cane, twice, before she 
backed out of range. 

Cording had found the button on 
the post. He pushed it. 

Corbell shouted, “He^aa!” The 
other booth danced with drifting 
dust motes. 

Cording opened the door and 
said, “Nothing happened.” 

“Not quite true,” said Corbell. 
To Mirelly-Lyra he said, “You 
don’t have to if you don’t want to. 
You can trust me or not. Gloat, 
gloat, he mocked himself, and was 
a little ashamed. But he’d fought 
for this! 

She swallowed whatever words 
were on her tongue. She was tmly 
desperate. As she entered the booth 
Corbell caught Cording’ s eye and 
pointed to the booth with no door. 

The dust floating in the booth 
suddenly thickened. Cording smiled 
and said, “Ah.” 

The Nom had caught it too, but 
she didn’t understand. .and Cor- 
bell was bubbling with it. “Inert 
molecules from your cells! Chemi- 
cal medicines won’t reach that stuff, 
but the ‘phone booth’ does. It takes 
just those dead molecules and does 
the instant-elsewhere trick with 
them. Just the stuff that builds up 
over ninety years of life. See it 
now?” 

“I don’t feel any different,” she 
said uncertainly. 

“You should. I did. It was like 
I’d caught my second wind. Of 

129 




course 1 was moving at a dead run. 
It’s nothing obvious. What did you 
expect? In a couple of days you’ll 
find dark roots in your hair.” 
“Red,” she said. “Fiery red.” 
“Where’s the helmet?” 

She smiled. She still looked like 
an old woman, but was there some- 
thing malicious in that smile? 



PEERSSA FOR THE STATE 
I 

Corbel!’ s pressure suit sat limp in 
a guest chair in Mirelly-Lyra’s of- 
fice. Cording and Mirelly-Lyra 
watched him detach the helmet and 
set it on his head. He cleared his 
throat and said, “This is Corbell for 
himself calling Peerssa for the 
State. Come in, Peerssa.” 

Nothing, nothing, noth- 
ing .. “He’s got to be in range 
by now. Peerssa, dammit, answer!” 

Cording pushed the suit aside and 
took the chair. The silver cane re- 
mained fixed on the old woman. 
She didn’t notice. Malice and vic- 
tory! She gave Corbell the shivers. 

Nothing, nothing, nothing, 
n — The voice came faintly, fading in 
spots. “Peerssa for the State, 
Peerssa for the State calling Jaybee 
Corbell. Please allow for a delay of 
sixty-seven seconds in transmission. 
Corbell, I have a great deal to tell 
you.” 

'"Yeah, you do! I’ve got a great 
deal to tell you too! I can tell you 
most of the history of the solar sys- 
tem. Tell me first, have you taken 
control of the planet Uranus? If so, 
what do you plan to do with it?” 
To Cording he said, “I’m asking 

130 



him now. We’ll know in a min- 
ute.” 

“What takes so long?” 

“Speed of light. Uranus must be 
thirty-three and a half light-seconds 
away.” 

Cording nodded. He was not im- 
patient. Even his handling of the 
cane seemed negligent . but it 
never left the old woman. Cood. 
Because she still had that look. 

When Peerssa spoke he was ir- 
ritatingly placid. “Yes, 1 am guid- 
ing a planet I believe to be Uranus. 
You were right in guessing that this 
is the solar system. After losing 
contact with you I flew to investi- 
gate the most easily available 
anomoly, the new planet between 
Jupiter and Saturn. I found a satel- 
lite with control systems which 
would respond to — ” 

“I know all about the motor! The 
question — ” He bit it off. The delay 
was going to drive him nuts. 
Peerssa was still talking: 

“ — my broadcasts. I was able to 
probe the fail-safe programs first. 
Otherwise I might have damaged 
something. Eventually I found an 
object in the planet’s upper atmos- 
phere radiating strongly in the in- 
frared. I found a tremendous motor, 
a fusion pulse drive clearly intended 
to move the entire planet. Oh, you 
know about the motor. All right. 
I’ve already started the braking 
sequence. In twenty-two days 
Uranus will be inserted into orbit 
two million miles ahead of the 
earth. I’m going to move the Earth 
further from Jupiter. We’ll cool it 
down to normal.” 

“Don’t do it!” Corbell barked. 
He remembered uneasily that he had 
never been sure of Peerssa’ s mo- 



GALAXY 




tives. “Listen, life on Earth has 
been adjusting to this situation for a 
million years or more. If you screw 
it up now most of the biosphere will 
die, including what passes for hu- 
manity these days.” 

The old woman already looked 
younger, if only in a tightening of 
muscles in her face, a smoothing of 
the pouchy look. Corbell looked 
away from the malicious cat-smile. 
He lifted the helmet and said, in 
Boyish, “We were right. No coin- 
cidence at all. Peerssa dropped me 
here, then went to look Uranus 
over,. He’s going to put everything 
back the way it was when he left 
Earth.” 

Cording stared. “But the ice! 
The ice would cover — ” 

“Bear with me a little longer, 
will you?” He lowered the hehnet 
on Cording ’s answer. 

Peerssa’s delayed reply came. “I 
do not take your orders, Corbell. 1 
take orders from Mirelly-Lyra 
Zeelathisthar, who was once a citi- 
zen of the State.” 

He should have known better, but 
it took him by surprise. He 
screamed, “You traitor!” 
Mirelly-Lyra threw back her head 
and laughed. 

Corbell laid the helmet on the 
desk. It took him a moment to find 
his voice. “No wonder you were 
smirking. What happened?” 

She was thoroughly enjoying her- 
self. “I tried to call your autopilot. 
No luck. A few days ago I tried 
again. It may have help^ that my 
translator uses your voice. Peerssa 
and I talked for many hours about 
the State, and the world, and 
you — ” 

She broke off because Peerssa’s 
THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



reply had arrived. “My loyalty has 
never wavered, Corbell. Was there 
ever a time when you could say the 
same?” 

“Drop dead,” Corbell told the 
helmet. “Stand by. Mirelly-Lyra is 
with us now. We’ll try to talk her 
into changing your orders.’’ To 
Cording he said, “She rules my au- 
topilot. She rules Uranus. I’m 
tii^.” 

“You must persuade her not to 
let it carry out its mission. This is 
urgent, Corbell.” 

“I thought of that.” Corbell 
closed his eyes and leaned back. 

He could watch it happen. As 
long as he could survive at all, he 
would be young. He could watch 
glaciers cover Antarctica until the 
ice was a mile thick. He and 
Mirelly-Lyra could watch the dwarf 
buffalo and the nude ^lar bears 
and the Boys and the dikta flee 
north until they froze in snowstorms 
or starved in land baked bare of life 
or died for lack of the vitamin D in 
kathope seed. 

Maybe that was an angle. Did the 
old retread want the Earth all for 
herself? Or would she prefer com- 
pany? But she’d fled the Boys once, 
and lived alone . hmm. Where 
did she get her food? Was there 
anything she couldn’t stand to see 
extinct? 

He opened his eyes. Cording was 
looking concerned for him. Oddly, 
so was the old woman. 

“Nothing hurts,” Cording said. 
“I was used to things hurting. 
Sometimes my breath would come 
short. Always my joints and ten- 
dons and muscles ached. Corbell, 
you’ve found it. We’re young 
again. You did what I could not.” 

131 




“Yeah. Good.” 

“Play on her gratitude. I can’t 
talk to her. It has to be you. You’re 
capable. The fate of the world is on 
your shoulders.” 

“That’s all I need.” He closed 
his eyes for a moment . just for 
a moment . and then he asked 
Mirelly-Lyra, “How do you feel?” 

“I feel good. I feel strong. 
Maybe I only want to believe your 
lie.” 

“Okay. Pay attention.” Corbell 
set the helmet between them. He 
talked half for Peerssa’s benefit. 
“The world is baked and dead ev- 
erywhere except in Antarctica. 
What’s left alive is all tropical stuff 
evolved for six years of daylight 
and six years of night. If Antarctica 
gets covered by ice again everything 
will die. The ruling population 
is — ” He used the Boyish word. 
“Boys, eleven-year-olds who live 
forever. There’s a minor population 
of adults for breeding. The men 
look like Gording, or younger. 
They’re human. There are some 
minor changes — ” He began to de- 
scribe them. 

Mirelly-Lyra regarded Gording 
without favor. But she must see him 
as human. The biggest difference, 
the receding hairline, looked natural 
on an old man. 

He hadn’t impressed her yet. He 
went on: “If we ever expect to get 
a State established again, it’ll be 
with the adults, the dikta. The Boys 
are too different. What I’m getting 
at is, there is a chance. Right now 
there are about ten women to every 
man, but in a hundred years it’ll be 
nearly one-to-one.” An angle there? 
He definitely had her attention. “Of 
course, your role wouldn’t be very 

132 



important at first, with that big an 
imbalance. But you’d be the only 
woman with a full head of hair. 
And the only redhead.” 

“Just a minute, Corbell. Isn’t it 
true that the Boys mle the adults? I 
don’t want to be a slave. And what 
about the Girls?” 

“The Girls are long dead.” 
“Ahh.” Mirelly-Lyra must have 
hated the Girls. 

“Right. It’s Boys and dikta now. 
We can get the dikta to move here, 
because we’ve got the dikta immor- 
tality. They’ll come. I know where 
to find a ship.” 

She was shaking her head, frown- 
ing. Now Corbell knew that she’d 
bought half of what he was selling. 
Against half-bald women her great 
beauty would rule the men who 
ruled the dikta! But — “How long 
have the Boys ruled?” 

“Ever since you brought the 
dikta to Antarctica as esca[^ con- 
victs, wheneverthehell that was. Say 
a million years.” 

Oncoming youth put music in her 
laugh. “And now they will break 
free, that suddenly? The sheep will 
become wolves because we offer 
them a sufficient bribe?’ ’ 

Dammit, she did have a point. 
He changed languages. “Gording? 
Will the dikta revolt?” 

“Yes.” 

“They never did before.” 

“The dangers were too great. 
The rewards were too small.” 
Maybe. Corbell switched to En- 
glish. “He says they will. I believe 
him. Now just a minute, let me tell 
you why. First, they have not been 
bred for docility. They’ve been bred 
to produce a better strain of Boys, 
and they’ve got the genes. 

GALAXY 




Second — how do I put this? You 
know what a cringing man looks 
like?” 

She grinned. She’d seen Corbell 
cringe, damn her. 

‘‘Okay. They cringe. But it’s a 
gesture, a formality. The next sec- 
ond they’re walking as tall as ever. 
The Boys cringe to each other, too. 

1 think the dikta haven’t revolted for 
a million years because the odds 
weren’t right. Now they are.” 

She sat silent, frowning. 

‘‘What did you think you’d get 
out of Peerssa moving the Earth?” 

‘‘I thought . We’re the last of 
the State, Corbell. I thought we 
could start the human race over.” 
‘‘Adam and Eve, with Eve in 
charge. Mirelly-Lyra, we’d better 
hope we can mate with the dikta, 
because, frankly. I’m terrified of 
you. I don’t think I could get it 
up.” 

‘‘Low sex urge?” 

‘‘Yeah. Would you like to rule 
the dikta instead? You’ll have one 
thing going for you. You rule the 
sky. Once again a Girl rules the 
sky.” 

He saw the beginnings of a smile 
(Corbell forgets that I can rule men 
with my beauty alone!) and he 
pushed it home. ‘‘But you’ve got to 
give Peerssa his orders now. He’s 
already started the braking se- 
quence. Move the Earth now and it’s 
the end of the world.” 

She leered teasingly. ‘‘I should 
make you wait.” 

‘‘Peerssa has already started 
the^” 

‘‘Give me the helmet.” 

‘‘God damn braking sequence. 
Here. Wait a minute.” He didn’t let 
go of the helmet. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



‘‘Corbell? Isn’t this what you 
wanted?” 

‘‘I just had the damndest 
thought.” Don’t blow this. The fate 
of the world — Shaddup. ‘‘Peerssa, a 
point of information. Would it be 
possible for you to — ” 

II 

From the roof of the office build- 
ing they watched Uranus pass. 

The planet must be smaller than 
it had been at Corbell’s birth. Its 
drive was not all that efficient; it 
must have blown away megamega- 
tons of atmosphere during aeons of 
maneuvering. For all that, a gas 
giant planet was now passing two 
million miles from the Earth. 

It was tremendous. It glowed half 
full near the horizon: a white half- 
disk touched with pink, banded and 
roiled with storms, and a night side 
black against the stars. From the 
black edge a tiny, intense violet- 
white flame suddenly reached out 
and out, lighting the night side, ex- 
panding, reddening, dissipating. 

Mirelly-Lyra said something that 
was pure music. No wonder she had 
been able to persuade men to do her 
bidding. (The old man’s voice said, 
“Glorious.”) Her white robe was a 
shapeless pale shadow in the daik. 
Corbell stood a little apart from her. 
Now that she was no longer an old 
woman, he was more afraid of her 
than ever. In very truth, the Norn 
now ruled the fate of the world. 

Corbell was very twitchy tonight. 

He called into the helmet in his 
hands. “Peerssa, how goes it?” 
And waited for the response. Noth- 
ing, nothing — 



133 




“Green bird.” The autopilot was 
indecently calm. “It was difficult to 
plot a new path that would not 
intersect a moon, but I did it. 
Earth's new orbit will be somewhat 
eccentric. Her average temperature 
will vary around ten degrees 
lower.” 

“Good enough.” He set the hel- 
met down. His urge was to call 
every two minutes. A giant planet 
falling that close wasn’t glorious, it 
was terrifying. 

She said it again. “Glorious. To 
think that the State once reached 
such heights! And now there are 
only savages.” 

“We’ll be back,” he said, and 
laughed too loudly. “Gording 
doesn’t know it, but what he’s 
doing in Dikta City is forming the 
basis for a population explosion. In 
three thousand years we’ll be build- 
ing interstellar spaceships again. 
We’ll need them. Earth will be too 
crowded.” 

“I hadn’t thought of that. 
Perhaps Gording did. Do you really 
think the dikta will come? A million 
years of slavery, after all — ” 

“They’ll have to come.” He’d 
thought it out in aU its intricate de- 
tail. “In a few months Cape Horn 
and Four City will be in the Temp- 
erate Zone. Plants that grow well in 
Antarctica will grow well here once 
we transport them. 

In Antarctica it’ll be colder than 
the Boys expect. They’ll huddle in 
Sarash-Zillish through six Olde 
Earth years of darkness. Meanwhile 
the dikta will be setting themselves 
up here. ’ ’ 

“All very well if the Boys wait. 
You’ve said they’re very intelligent. 
They may attack immediately.” 

134 



“Let them wait a few months and 
we’ll give them a nasty shock! 
We’ll have Peerssa in orbit then. 
Didn’t he tell you? He’s got a thing 
that can blast them from orbit while 
they try to cross the ocean. They’ll 
think it’s the Girls. They’ll try to 
wipe out the Himalaya valleys and 
the Sea of Okhotsk. But if they wait 
long enough . There’s going to 
be rain, a lot of rain, when the 
Earth cools off. It’ll probably swal- 
low Dikta City. TTie Boys’ll think 
the dikta drowned.” 

Uranus jetted violet-white flame. 
Peerssa’s path through Jupiter’s 
moons was a complicated one. The 
night was vivid with lights: Jupiter, 
Uranus, the expanding pinpoint 
flare of the world-moving drive, the 
moons. The air was hot and humid 
and redolent with some rare scent, 
not quite musk, not quite flower 
shop. Corbell wondered where it 
came from. Were whales holding a 
mating season offshore? The air 
went to his head. 

The shadow in the dark asked, 
“Will the dikta men find me beauti- 
ful?” 

“Yes. If the women liked me, 
the men will like you. Beautiful and 
exotic.” 

She turned to him. “But you 
don’t find me beautiful.” 

“My sex urge is supposed to — ” 
“That is no answer!” she flared. 
“You lay with the dikta women!” 
He flinched back. “If you must 
know. I’ve always been a little 
afraid of a beautifol girl. And I’m 
scared stiff of you. My hindbrain 
thinks you’re still carrying that 
cane.” 

“Corbell, you are well aware that 
the dikta may not survive the 



GALAXY 




change in their biological rhythms. 
The sun shows every day of the 
year in Four City.” She touched his 
arm. “Even if they live, we are the 
last human beings. If we die with- 
out children ...” 

He wanted to shrink away, but 
something in him simultaneously 
wanted to move closer. He sup- 
pressed both urges. “You’re mov- 
ing too fast. There may be dikta 
women carrying my children. 
That'll tell us if they’re human — 
and even if they aren’t, they’re 
close enough.” 

“Let’s go inside. The heat — ” 
When he gestured toward the garish 
intruder in the sky, she tugged at 
his arm. “If it falls on the Earth, do 
you really want to be watching?” 

“Yes.” But he picked up the 
helmet and followed her. She didn’t 
have the cane any more. All she 
had to wave at him was a planet ten 
times the size of the Earth. 

It was cooler in the elevator. Air 
conditioning. His nerves still tin- 
gled, whether from Uranus’s passing 
or from the nearness of the 
Norn ... He sniffed suddenly, and 
had to swallow a laugh. That was 
what he had smelled on the roof. 
She had never won perfume before. 

Her hood was thrown back. Her 
hair was exotic: long, fine white 
hair flowing out of a fiery red 
undercoat. Of the wrinkles of age 
there were only traces left. Her 
breasts were . exotic, yeah: high 
and conical, delightfully pointed 
under the robe. Would the dikta see 
them as powerfully sensual? or as 
evidence of animal origin? 

The elevator had stopped. The 
doors opened. But Corbell was flat- 
tened against the wall, and 

136 



Mirelly-Lyra wasn’t moving either. 
She watched him uneasily as he 
took in great lungfuls of air, using 
all of his strengdi to hold himself 
still. 

.He wanted her. It was a madness 
in him, and he was terrified. “Per- 
fume,” he said, and his voice was a 
croak. 

She said, “Yes. Shame on you 
for forcing me to such means. If it 
gives you pleasure to attack my 
pride, you’ve won.” 

“I don’t andststandV 

“Pheromones. I altered my medi- 
cal system to make pheronomes to 
affect your sex urge. Pheromones 
are biochemical cues.” She stepped 
forward, put her hands on his 
shoulders. “Do you think I wanted 
it this—” 

And the touch of her was all it 
took. 

The fastenings on her robe 
weren’t closed, save one, which 
ripped. He had more trouble with his 
own loincloth, his hands were 
shaking so, and he howled with 
frustration. She had to do it for him. 
He took her on the floor of the 
elevator, quickly, violently. Maybe 
he hurt her. Maybe he wanted to. 

And his head still bubbled with 
the perfume. He had not had time 
to notice the differences in her. 
Now he did. Even fifty thousand 
years had wrought changes. Her an- 
kles were heavier, her body was 
thicker in every dimension, than the 
standard of beauty in 1970 AD. 
And she had the damndest eyes, 
with a tilt that was not orien- 
tal .. and a soft woman’s 
mouth ... He took her again. She 
wasn’t passive, but she wasn’t 
wholly enjoying it either; she was 

GALAXY 




frightened of what she had un- 
leashed. 

Afterward he was calmer. They 
moved out of the elevator onto the 
cloud-rug floor. The third time it 
was she who mounted him. He tried 
to hold himself back, to let her find 
Tier own way, but when it was over 
he could see his handprints bone- 
white on her hips. He said, belated- 
ly, “Are you all right?” 

She laughed. Still straddling him, 
she ran her hands through her hair. 
“I’m young. I’ll heal.” 

“You used an aphrodesiac on 
me.” 

“Yes. Aphrodesiac. The 
pheromones were Peerssa’s sugges- 
tion.” 

“What? Peerssa? I’ll kill him! 
He — and youl You used me like a 
bundle of reflexes, the pair of 
you!” He wanted to cry. “Not like 
something that thinks. It’s just like 
that damn cane.” 

“Forget that damn cane! We 
have to have children. We’re the 
last ones. What do you want from 
me, Corbell?” 

“I don’t know. Ask me when my 
head starts working again. I want 
Peerssa dead, I want Pierce the 
checker dead. Would he kill himself 
if you told him to?” 

“He did what he had to. He has 
to make the State again. Corbell, 
isn’t this better than the cane? Isn’t 
it?” 

“All right, it’s better than the 
cane.” 

“Then what do you want? Will 
you mate with me without the 
pheromones? Shall I tell Peerssa to 
follow your orders?” 

He wanted (he discovered) 
Mirabelle. He wanted the old ritual: 



dinner at a new restaurant recom- 
mended by friends, and brandy 
Alexanders afterward, and the king 
size bed. They’d bought a water 
bed a little before the cancer came 
to tear up his belly. Now here he 
was on his back in cloud-rug, in a 
corridor outside an elevator, with 
the strangest of strange women. 
“Not your fault,” he said. “I want 
to go home.” 

She shook her head. “I want to 
go home too. We can’t. We have to 
build our home again.” 

They were already doing that, 
Corbell thought. Maybe they’d even 
do it well. He said, “Even love 
stories aren’t the same. 
Pheromones! Jesus, what a way to 
save the world. Will you please fix 
that translator so it talks to me in 
your voice?’ ’ 

“All right. Tomorrow,” said an 
old man’s voice. 

“And put me in control of 
Peerssa, if you value my sanity. I’m 
sick of him running my life.” 

“Now?” 

“Tomorrow.” One more thing he 
would have liked to do. He would 
have liked to destroy the cane by 
smashing it repeatedly into Peers- 
sa’s brain case. But they might need 
Peerssa and the cane against the 
Boys, if they came too soon. 

So he rolled aside and looked for 
his loincloth . and then, chang- 
ing his mind, he leaned close to 
Mirelly-Lyra and inhaled deeply. 
Uranus must have passed by now, 
and Earth was on its way into a 
wider orbit, and world-saving could 
wait until tomorrow. Maybe the 
pheromone perfume could be used 
judiciously, in much smaller quan- 
tities ... ★

Davy, Edgar Pangbom, Ballantine, 
265 pp., $1.25 

As YOU CAN SEE from the above 
list, I had planned to close this col- 
umn with Edgar Pangbom’s Davy. I 
chose that slot on the last-heard = 
best-remembered theory — I had in- 
tended to see to it, to the best of 
my ability, that Edgar sold a helluva 
lot of books and got a little 
more of the recognition he has de- 
served for so many years. 

But before I could type the first 
paragraph of this column, the news 
came down. Now 1 sit here staring 
out my office window, watching the 
Bay of Fundy pet the beach with 
timid gentle strokes, watching bold 
explorer clouds set sail for far New 
Brunswick, and I know I can’t save 
Davy for last after all. You can’t 
end with a bummer. 

Edgar died on February 1, 1976, 
at the age of 66. 

He felt that his writing career 
truly began with “Angel’s Egg,’’ 
(Galaxy 1951) although he had sold 
his first novel (a mystery, under the 
name “Bruce Harrison’’) in 1930. 
He won the International Fantasy 
Award, the same prize Sturgeon’s 
More Than Human had won two 
years earlier, in 1955 for A Mirror 
For Observers, currently available 
in the Avon/Equinox “SF Redis- 
covery’’ series, and sold mysteries, 



historical fiction, fantasies and 
“hard’’ sf. He was a writer of 
enormous skill and depth, an equal 
of Sturgeon and a peer of Mark 
Twain, and I’m bitterly sorry that 
he died before he — and you — could 
read the words I wrote about him in 
the March ’76 Galaxy Bookshelf. I 
am bitterly sorry that he died before 
the world noticed him, before he 
had attained the stature of a Twain, 
which he surely must some day. I 
am fiercely glad that, as “Harper 
Conan and Singer David’’ (Tomor- 
row Today, Unity Press — see March 
’76 Bookshelf) clearly shows, Edgar 
died in his prime, at the absolute 
top of his form as an artist. And I 
am totally determined to pound into 
your skull (if it isn’t there already) 
the conviction that Edgar Pangbom 
is an important author who belongs 
on your must-read list and mine and 
belonged there, goddamit, twenty 
years ago. 

Take Davy. A Hugo nominee for 
1965, it lost out, for God’s sake, to 
The Wanderer (about which more 
next month) and is billed in Ballan- 
tine’ s current edition as “The ‘Tom 
Jones’ of Science Fiction.’’ I 
couldn’t seem to get a review copy, 
and then a gent named Tom Pigaga 
from U. of Nebraska’s English De- 
partment (having tried to order it for 
his own classes and been told it was 
out-of-print) sent me his personal 
copy in the mail, calling it “a small 
gift to a friend and a peace offering 
to the world at large.’’ According to 
his letter, Tom’s been using Davy 

141 



BOOKSHELF 




in class for three years, and he says 
he’s been coming back to it once a 
year or so since 1964, “as both pil- 
grimage and labor of love.” 

Thank you, Tom, stranger and 
friend. I intend to do likewise, and 
I urge all of you to do the same — if 
you can get a copy. 

Davy is the ultimate After-The- 
Collapse novel, the only one I’ve 
ever read that totally rang true 
(well. Earth Abides comes close — 
but Stewart achieved versimilitude 
through facts, with painstaking ex- 
trapolation. Pangbom does it with 
characterization.). I see where Bal- 
lantine got the “Tom Jones” 
allusion — but I think it reads more 
as if Mark Twain had written Hack 
Finn as an adult sf novel. It is a 
warm, vibrant, laughing, sprawling 
giant of a book. It is, as Sturgeon 
has called it, “a rollicking, ca- 
denced, surprising, provocative and 
musical book.” It evokes feelings 
the way a master musician elicits 
notes from his instrument: in 
chords, and breathtaking arpeggios. 
It has significantly changed my life 
and my writing, changed the way I 
perceive my fellow monkeys, made 
me happier to be alive. It is what 
the doctor ordered and why the 
preacher danced. It is good. 

Am I getting through to you? 
Will you know what I mean if I say 
that Pangbom ’s characters are lova- 
ble? Do you understand the sense in 
which I use that word? Sam Loomis 
and Pa Rumley and Dion and poor 
old sin-ridden Jed; Caron and 
142 



Emmia and Minna and Bonnie and 
Mother Spinkton and especially 
Nickie (whom I shall always love 
and lust for); these and Davy him- 
self are people I cherish, friends 
I’m glad I made, and I’m deeply 
grateful to Edgar for introducing me 
to them. I wanted to meet him, to 
thank him for becoming a writer. A 
man who can evoke that much love 
for totally imaginary people cobbled 
up out of the spare parts in his sub- 
conscious is a rare and splendid 
thing, an asset to the human spirit. 

There is no plot to Davy. A plot 
would overcrowd it. It has, rather, 
a . direction that it moves in. 

Now I would like someone to in- 
troduce me to review copies of West 
of the Sun, Company of Glory (L 
have the Aug-Oct ’74 Galaxy 
serialization, but I want the book 
too). The Judgement of Eve, Good 
Neighbors And Other Strangers, 
The Atlantean Nights’ Entertain- 
ments, Light Another Candle, The 
Trial of Callista Blake and the host 
of uncollected stories and novelettes 
set in the post-Holocaust world of 
Davy that will surely (please God) 
be collected and published soon. If 
any enterprising fan and/or booksell- 
er knows where I can buy copies of 
same. I’ll be happy to, whether or 
not I do get review copies. The 
same goes for Ten Tomorrows and 
Terry Carr’s An Exaltation of Stars 
and Universes 1, 2, 3 and 5, which 
Tom Pigaga says include recent 
short Pangbom. 

I hope it takes me a lifetime to 
GALAXY 




assemble and get to read all that 
Pangbom. ’Cause that seems to be 
all there’s gonna be. 

It’s plenty. Thank you, Edgar.

Most of the above data, bio- 
graphical and bibliogixq>hical, come 
from the next subject I want to cov- 
er. I have, I tell you three times, 
NO SLIGHTEST INTENTION of 
doing fanzine reviews in this col- 
umn (“. .at this time,” he 
finished tantalizingly), but Locus is 
not precisely a fanzine. It is a 
newspaper — the newspaper of the sf 
world. I once gave away, as op- 
posed to “spent,” a year editing a 
“specialized-audience” paper (a 
real-estate weekly, God forgive 
me), and I know what a sonofabitch 
of a job it is, and I know Charlie 
and Dena Brown do about a six- 
times-better job than I did on half 
the budget and in a more honorable 
cause. Their most recent (at this 
writing) edition (Mar. 31 ’76) con- 
tains two splendid write-ups on 
Edgar Pangborn, one of them by 
Peter S. Beagle (4 Fine And Private 
Place, The Last Unicorn, I See By 
My Outfit), that alone are more than 
worth Ae 500 cover price. The re- 
portage is conspicuously and notori- 
ously accurate (all right, ev- 
erybody’s human — but these guys 
print retractions where you can see 
’em), up-to-date and as thorough as 
space allows; the market reports are 



consistently more reliable than the 
ones in the SFWA Forum', the 
“People Notes” are usually interest- 
ing and informative (did you know 
that Larry Niven is working on a 
sequel to Ringworldl)', the advance 
publishers’ schedules are enor- 
mously helpful in getting to a book 
during those brief few weeks when 
it’s actually on the stands, available 
for sale; the annual sf book and 
magazine summaries are infinitely 
more accurate than the guesses of 
Publisher’ s Weekly, the “Media 
Notes” are appalling glances at the 
atrocities Hollywood is planning to 
perpetrate on sf (still no action on 
the Star Trek movie, and the Dam- 
nation Alley movie is going to 
star ... are you ready? . Charl- 
ton Heston as Hell Tanner.); and 
the convention reports are the 
only totally comprehensive ones I 
know of in the field. (By the way, 
speaking of conventions . 
no, I’ll get to that later.) 

But that ain’t all, folks: Charlie, 
Dena and their noble staff undertake 
to read and at least capsule-review 
every sf book, new or reprint, pub- 
lished in English, a plainly phenom- 
enal task I wouldn’t attempt for 
all the tea in Acupulco (890 titles 
last year alone!). Even the quickie- 
reviews, by far the most common, 
are thoughtful and contain all the 
necessary poop to locate the book 
should it interest you. A staggering 
achievement. The longer reviews 
are invariably thoughtful, too.

On we go to Imperial Earth, Ar- 
thur C. Clarke’s new biggie. Arthur 
told the United States Congress that 
I.E. was his most ambitious novel. 

144 



Unquote. The first run of 20,000 
copies has sold out (in hardback]) 
as I write this in May, and the sec- 
ond may do so before you read it: 
the book, says Locus, has been 
doing phenomenally well. 

Well, I’ll tell ya: by me it would 
have made a great novelette. 

Maybe even a short story. But 
not a book — not even a novella. 
There’s enough story to comfortably 
fill a fair-size novelette, and good 
story at that. But the bulk of the 
book is taken up by an extended 
“travelogue” of Earth in the Quin- 
centennial year 2276, which I found 
mostly cutesy and clever and satiric 
and dull and not very plausible. 
You know, the kind of stuff every 
beginning author does, future gen- 
erations commenting snidely on the 
odd and uncouth customs of their 
20th-century ancestors and like that. 
There were some nice touches, e.g. 
the political system in which only 
unwilling citizens can serve in pub- 
lic office, but most were about as 
likely to actually happen. 

What I mean to say, it was 
nowhere near as actively unpleasant 
to read as the majority of the books 
that grow in my little mailbox by 
the Bay — I didn’t have to hold my 
nose to get it down. Arthur’s al- 
ways a good, painless read, you 
know that. It’s just that this one 
was like a diet-book (to continue 
the above metaphor): a low-calorie 
concoction with a guaranteed non- 
carcinogenous story-substitute and 
non-fattening characterization. A 

GALAXY 




half hour later I was hungry again. 
Sank my teeth into some John 
McPhee and gnawed off a couple of 
chapters, washing it down with the 
new David Bromberg album. 

Oh, you wanna know what it’s 
about! Well, this guy from Titan (a 
clone of a clone of the most power- 
ful sonofabitch thereon), goes to 
Earth to round out his education and 
get himself cloned and make a 
speech (on account of it happens to 
be America’s five-hundredth birth- 
day). While he’s digging the Quin- 
centennial festivities as an honored 
guest, he finds out some heavy stuff 
about two childhood friends with 
whom he used to play Doctor. 

There you go. Twenty thousand 
copies, eight bucks a hit. Fast as 
they can print ’em. 

Oh ye^, and there’s this terrific 
intellectual-puzzle type game called 
“polyominoes” which will certainly 
be the rage at the next Worldcon 
(speaking of conventions . no, 
later.), among the more compul- 
sively brilliant fans. Me, I might 
get time to fiddle with it along 
about the time the roof gets 
shingled — say, next incarnation. 

I don’t really mean to do a 
hatchet job on this book. I just 
found it sorta frivolous, kind of 
charming, and the sales figures 
make me nervous. Rendevous With 
Rama, with not much more story to 
it than Imperial Earth, copped the 
Hugo off some mighty heavy books 
two years ago. There’s some mighty 
heavy books up for Hugos this year.

Oboy. Now we come to one of 
the few Nebula-winners of recent 
vintage that I liked worth a damn: 
Joe Haldeman’s masterful The 
Forever War. 

Should there be one of you out 
there so removed from the currents 
of the sf ocean that you haven’t 
heard of The Forever War yet, just 
take my word for it and go buy the 
book. If you have heard of it and 
haven’t bought it, shoot your advis- 
ers and go remedy the omission at 
once. It is the whelk’s kneecap, 
friends, the genuine dromedary’s 
drawers, probably the ultimate 
space- war novel. 

Some grumble at its similarities 
to Starship Troopers, the combat 
suits and so on. Others crow at the 
differences between Joe’s kind of 
war and Heinlein’s, calling Forever 
War a direct refutation of Troopers 
and an indictment of dat oT fascist 
Heinlein. Both camps might be in- 
terested to know that at the 1975 
Nebula Awards ceremony (at which 
Heinlein received the first Grand 
Master Nebula for lifetime contribu- 
tion to sf), Heinlein and Haldeman 
were introduced, and Heinlein stuck 
out his hand and said, “Just read 
your book. Forever War. Terrific.” 
At which Joe blushed and fum-fahed 
and hamahamatd and spent the bal- 
ance of the evening walking around 
a half-meter off the floor. Some- 
thing there is in fandom that likes a 
feud, real or imaginary. 

145 




I have to agree with Heinlein: 
it’s a Peach. Joe extrapolates rel- 
ativistic temporal distortion to its 
logical effect on interstellar warfare: 
soldiers return from a battle to fmd 
Earth changed beyond recognition 
by different time-rates, their loved 
ones and friends long dead — then 
return to the pointless, deadly, 
perplexing war between the stars. 
Joe’s characters are real, his obser- 
vations on war are biting and tren- 
chant, his army-of-the-future is all- 
too-plausible, and his pace is com- 
pelling. By God, he even pulls off a 
happy ending without straining. 

I suggest you read Forever War 
in combination with Starship 
Troopers — most instructive. But if 
you are one of the knee-jerk radi- 
cals who keep coming up to me at 
conventions babbling about fascism 
(speaking of conventions . forget 
it), you want to bear in mind four 
things: 

1) FW assumes that Earth’s in- 
terstellar army establishment will 
resemble the present U.S. Army in 
brainlessness, venality and rapacity; 
ST assumes that they will generally 
be ethical men, fallible but good- 
hearted. Both are, on the evidence 
of history, conceivable — and re- 
member that in Heinlein’s M.I., 
generals fight too. 

2) FJf’s army is conscript; 57” s 
is volunteer — resign any time, no 
penalty except loss of franchise. 

3) Heinlein’s future society is a 
hypothetical experimental alterna- 
tive to our own; Haldeman’s is the 

146 . 



straight-line extrapolation of our 
own. 

4) Heinlein is not Juan Rico (or 
Col. Dubois) any more than Joe is 
Pvt./MajcK- Mandella. 

Onward.

To more splendor, exclusively 
visual this time. A pair of coffee 
table books have appeared in my 
mailbox, and they’re so splendid 
I’m going to have to go out and 
make a coffee table to put them on 
(just before I shingle the roof . .). 

Who could be surprised that The 
Fantastic Art of Frank Frazetta was 
superb? Frank has been the undis- 
puted master of fantasy illustration 
for God only knows how long, and 
his style is the most imitated in the 
field. People who’ve never heard of 
sf notice The Fantastic Art in my 
office, exclaim, “Oh, him,” and 
bury themselves in the book for 
hours. 

All I need tell you about 
TFAOFF is that it contains 42 color 
plates of Frank’s most famous paint- 
ings (plus a few cartoons) with re- 
production so achingly, exquisitely 
perfect that the pictures probably, as 
Thuiber once said, “lose something 
in the original.” The book is worth 
three times its cover price of $10, 
and I’m deeply gratefiil to Galaxy’s 
Assistant Editor and Official Whip- 
ping Girl, Cynthia Bolling, for pass- 
ing along the review copy, which 
she lusted after, when she could just 

GALAXY 




as well have denied all knowledge 
of its whereabouts. Thanks, 
Cynthia. 

In fact, TFAOFF is so damn 
good that I waited a couple of days 
after I was done with it to open up 
The Best of Stephen Fabian. Didn’t 
seem fair to stack a newcomer’s 
first black-and-white folio next to 
the best oils of an old master. 

I needn’t have. Fabian’s first col- 
lection stands quite well beside 
Frazatta, thank you, in spite of the 
fact that it’s all black and white. 
You can’t flip the pages of Galaxy 
with your eyes open and fail to 
notice that Fabian is great; what I 
had somehow failed to notice was 
that he is GREAT. There are 50 
plates in this spiral-bound folio, 
many from Galaxy and IF , some 
from books like The Occult Love- 
craft and Savage Tales of Conan (I 
must admit I find Frazetta’s Conan 
more badass), some from fanzines 
like Energumen and Fantastic, and 
some previously unpublished. All 
are superb, my particular favorites 
being #s 6, 31 and especially-49 
(all three untitled), and the repro is 
as good as that in TFAOFF. 

It’s available, as far as I know, 
only by writing Loompanics Unlim- 
ited, Box 264, Mason, Michigan 
48854, $12.50 a hit. Worth it, by me: 
with its black-and-white cover and 
spiral-notebook format, it’s not as 
visually attractive a coffee-table 
package as the Frazetta, nor as dur- 
able an artifact. But then, it’s easier 
to remove individual plates for 

BOOKSHELF 



framing without destroying the rest 
of the book. You pays your money 
and takes your choice. 

Me, I choose both. 

* * 

I’ve gotten a couple of fascinat- 
ing letters from blind fans, both of 
whom commented on the cussed 
difficulty of obtaining sf in Braille. 
I’m instructing my agent to put a 
clause in all future contracts requir- 
ing a Braille run; I understand 
David Gerrold does this as a matter 
of course. Well, those last two 
books aren’t a helluva lot of good 
to the blind, but the next few items 
are. 

Two of them, anyway. In my 
continuing campaign to be the most 
eclectic sf reviewer in the North, 
I’ve located three phonograph rec- 
ords (with concomitant cassettes and 
tapes) of sf, and the first of these is 
a turkey. 

2112 is a rock album, one side of 
which is (God save the Mark) a 
rock opera, whose story line no 
doubt seemed to its creators to be 
science fiction. Furthermore, side 
two contains a gem entitled “The 
Twilight Zone,’’ which its got 
heavy lyrics, man, about time and 
space collidin’ and stuff. So when 
my neighbor Francis lent it to me, I 
gave it a listen. 

Well, I can’t exactly criticize it 
musically. Rush, a three-man 
British band (I think they’re British. 
They taste British.), are technically 

147 




competent and just what they want 
to be: a superb Led Zeppelin imita- 
tion. If you like the thing Robert 
Plant does with his vocal chords, 
and what Jimmy Page does to a 
guitar, you’ll love Rush’s music. It 
gave me a pain in the ear, forced 
me to medicate myself with some 
Loudon Wainwright III, but that’s 
my taste, right? 

About the “Science Fiction’’ 
part. “2112,” the title piece, is ded- 
icated to “the genius of Ayn 
Rand,’’ and based on some 
extensively-quoted but nowhere 
identified work of hers with which I 
was not familiar — and which 
seemed, from the quotes, to be a 
dog. There’s this Big Brother Fu- 
ture in 2112, see: a world ruled by 
the Priests of the Temple of Syrinx, 
whose “great computers/ fill the 
hallowed halls,” a world where no- 
body ever has any fun. Then this 
wandering person (unnamed, called 
“he” for convenience) stumbles 
across a hidden old room behind a 
waterfall, in which rest the rusted 
remains of an electric guitar. He 
teaches himself how to tune it, 
apparently devises a portable 
amplifier-and-power-pack, and 
rushes ingenuously off to share his 
marvelous discovery with the 
Priests. To his confusion and hor- 
ror, they Jump up and down on the 
thing (if someone came into my 
chapel and started playing an elec- 
tric guitar like Jimmy Page, I might 
stomp it some myself) and drive 
him out into the desert, where he 

148 



starves to death. The three mu- 
sicians who’ve been mysteriously 
following him around all day, mad- 
dened by grief, gnash their instru- 
ments with their teeth and hurl 
themselves through their own 
amplifiers. 

Oh yes, there’s an extended quote 
on the back of the jacket, pointedly 
not ascribed to Ayn Rand, which 
describes a science fictional 
background world utterly inconsis- 
tent with that of the rock opera. 
And the “Twilight Zone” cut isn’t 
even worth making fun of. 

So I’ll drop the bleeding hulk and 
turn to: the Goodies. 

Alternate World Recordings is 
going to end up being a tremendous 
boon to blind sf fans, fans with 
eyestrain, illiterate fans (don’t 
laugh, don’t laugh) and fans with 
alexia. And also to those who lil^e 
both spoken-word recordings and sf. 

The only two I’ve received for 
review are just great: excellent and 
apparently durable recordings of 
two splendid vocal instruments 
rendering good sf that is uniquely 
suited to the medium. The first of 
these is a surefire classic: Fritz 
Leiber reading his own Hugo- 
winning Gonna Roll The Bones and 
a Fafhrd & Gray Mouser fragment 
called “In The Witch’s Tent.” If 
you’ve never heard Fritz read, take 
my word that he has one of the 
great speaking voices of our age, 
equal even to the hype that Forty 
Ackerman gives it on the jacket. To 
tell you the honest truth, I didn’t 

GALAXY 




care a hell of a lot for “Bones” 
when I first read it in Dangerous 
Visions years ago. But after hearing 
Fritz read it, I like it fine. A rip- 
roaring fantasy about an ace crap- 
shooter who meets . 

There’s also a lyrical and concise 
appraisal by Poul Anderson of Fritz 
and his work on the dust-jacket, and 
a rather good cover drawing by 
Tom Barber. 

The second record comprises two 
poems and two short stories by 
Robert E. Howard, all chilling and 
oddly compelling — if you have a 
morbid turn of mind. I don’t think I 
could listen to it a second time, but 
I enjoyed it the once — and you may 
be one of the appalling multitude of 
Lovecrafty horror freaks who get 
off on ancient terrors and ghastly 
gods and flayed souls as a steady 
diet. Me — well, once I smoked 
opium. I enjoyed it the once. 

But if you like Howard, this is 
prime Howard. The one I liked the 
best (and would be most likely to 
enjoy a second time) was a marvel- 
ous old Kull of Valusia story called 
“The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune.” It 
raised the hairs on my neck (until 
they were old enough to fend for 
themselves). 

All the selections are read by 
Ugo Toppo (honest), an established 
pro in the field of spoken word. 
Frankly I found him just a hair too 
hammy for my taste (you know, 
heavy significant pauses before 
words that aren’t all that heavy, 
stuff like that, a bit too much 



Shakespearean Shudder in the voice 
here and there), but I must admit 
his voice is superb and versatile. 

And this one contains a small 
booklet with complete text.

Back to the written word. The 
End of the Dreams is what Harlan 
is always getting falsely accused of: 
a 100% recycled product. It com- 
prises three long stories by James 
Gunn, reprinted from three earlier 
Gunn collections. According to the 
foreword, it is companion volume 
to one released last year, also con- 
sisting of reprints from previous 
Gunn collections, to which these 
stories are sequels. 

But this is not a case of filing off 
the serial numbers and peddling it 
over the state line, any more than it 
is when Harlan manages to keep his 
works in print and available for 
sale. The collections in question 
were issued in the 1950s by Ban- 
tam, which has no hardcover line, 
and I for one never saw any of ’em. 
If reshuffling the stories themati- 
cally helps Jim Gunn resell ’em, I 
say huzzah. The end result was, 1 
got to read them. 

And they’re dandy stories. Just a 
hair dated, but they were written 
when a story was a story, when 

149 



BCXIKSHELF 




dreamers had hope and a “science 
of happiness” seemed within man’s 
ultimate grasp. “The Immortal” 
(part of a collection of which the 
1970 ABC-TV series The Immortal 
was a botched clone) in particular 
was vivid and chilling, and “Space 
Is A Lonely Place” had a splendid 
ending. 

Jim is a past president of SFWA 
and an Ole Pro and this is some of 
his vintage stuff, available for the 
first time in hardcover. Tamam 
shud.

I almost didn’t read George Alec 
Effinger’s new collection. Irrational 
Numbers. Robert Silverberg’s 
supercilious introduction, asserting 
that This Probably Isn’t What You 
Wanted To Read But That’s Your 
Problem, Jerk nearly convinced me. 
But I happen to have read some 
stuff by Piglet that I liked, so I 
pressed on. And found the book 
OK. 

It comes in some-hazy-where 
around 65 on the Spider Scale; I 
frankly admit that part of the time I 
didn’t know what Piglet was talking 
about and a small part of the time I 
actively disliked how he was doing 
it. But many of the stories appealed 
to me, and “At The Bran Foundry” 
was hilarious, a delightful, creepy 
and superbly paced paranoid fantasy 
about a class field trip through the 
foundry where they stamp ore into 
bran flakes, (the Firesign Theatre 

150 



would have loved it.) The book’s 
out on lend to a fellow Effingerian, 
and I can’t remember the title of the 
other story I especially liked, a 
tragicomic masterpiece about a 
football player who finds that get- 
ting skulled on the field gives him 
incredibly realistic flashbacks of the 
day his wife died — and endures 
them, seeks them out, for the vivid 
glimpses of his wife. 

Yes, Effmger is a maverick writ- 
er. But don’t let that worry you: 
A.E. Van Vogt was a maverick 
writer once.

I’m running so far over that I’m 
going to have to give minireviews

pending on the new lead-time)

That’s off my mind; so much for

This Darkening Universe — Lloyd 
Biggie is a writer of enormous po-

This is more tongue-in-cheek, part 
of a series about an interstellar pri- 
vate eye, who in this number taJces 
on an Unidentified Death Force 
(Udef) that sterilizes every planet it 
touches. Not a great book, but a 
good read — and I’d like to see the 
rest of the series. I think what 
Lloyd needs is to stop churning 
them out for Doubleday and write 
the hell out of one. But maybe he 
did that for years and starved and I 
never read him — how should I 
know? Shut up. Spider 

The Unpleasant Profession of

collection of some of Heinlein’s 
finest — and most offbeat — work, in- 
cluding the title story (a slambang 
fantasy), the Grand Classic defini-

plausible “They,” (about the ulti-.

“The Man Who Traveled In

Connoisseur’s Science Fiction — 
British editor-publisher-reviewer 
Tom Boardman has assembled a 
slick, respectable-type Penguin 
collection — with a startling cover 
for which the outlandish title must 
be apology. All great stories, by 
Bester, Pohl, Sturgeon, Asimov et 
al — but virtually every single one 
was savagely satiric in theme or 
execution. My lip got curled into a 
permanent sneer. Does cynicism 
make you a connoisseur? Or the 
other way ’round? 

Star Trek: The New Voyages — I 
am told that the majority of the 
material in this compendium of 
stories and articles ranges from 
good to excellent. Myself, I have a 
threshold problem: I have become 
constitutionally (and apparently in- 
curably) incapable of assimilating 
one more written or spoken word 
having to do with Captain Bones 
and 'feoman Spock and Doctor 
Tribble and the Star Ship Inter- 
course which like a transvestite in a 
ladies room boldly goes where no 
man has gone before. If you don’t 
have this condition (called “At- 
rekia’’), enjoy. 

Logan’s Run — should have been 
titled “Nolan and Johnson’s Runs,” 
a ghastly slapdash skeleton of a 

152 



book by two men who, from their 
track record, have no excuse. It’s a 
more-than-hackneyed Race Against 
Death in your standard-issue Big 
Brother future, so shallow I 
couldn’t get the soles of my feet 
wet. About a world of the young, 
where they kill you when you reach 
age 21. Honest to God. Soon, it 
says here, to be a major MGM 
movie, with Michael York and 
Peter Ustinov. I flatly predict that 
said flick will be as piquant as the 
end result of a lentil dinner with 
Coca Cola; consequently it and the 
book get the third or is it fourth 
Galaxitive Award. 

Telempath — I happen to have 
read this particular book on the 
close order of 100,000 times, in its 
prepublication stages. And yet it 
chanced that when the galleys came 
across my desk the other day, 1 
hadn’t read a word of it in over a 
year, so I believe I can maintain 
some objectivity. I read it in a sin- 
gle twelve-hour sitting, totally ab- 
sorbed in its superb blend of tradi- 
tional and innovative sf, its magni- 
ficent characterization. This man 
writes with muscle and style. De- 
serves the Reviewer’s Highest Ac- 
colade: Just The Way I’d Have 
Done It Myself.

It was unanimous. 

Barry Malzberg & Bill Fronzlnl 




As OF COURSE YOU know, this is 
my first inauguration — but I cer- 
tainly hope and pray it will not be 
my last! 

So then, here we are. I, Carole: 
your new President. You, my bil- 
lions and billions and billions and 
billions of friends: needful, trustful, 
loving. It was not six months ago, 
as you’ll all remember, that 1, as 
commander of the Skipstone, 
proudly took us all in spirit to the 
Centauris, hoping that this resuscita- 
tion of the long-abandoned space pro- 
ject would give you unity, would weld 
together everyone on this globe. 
This had been done even without 
my efforts; you have found your 
unity, and you have delivered unto 
me as your President and with that 
union the clear high promise of 
your mandate — 

Pardon me. Pardon me for this 
excess of rhetoric. You must surely 
understand how emotionally moved 
1 am. You must surely understand 
my emotions on this difficult and 
poignant occasion, which does not 
yet lack the promise of joy. 1, 
Carole: six months ago, the first 
female commander of a major spa- 
tial probe; now, the first female 
President. 1 am deeply, universally 
honored — 

Again, please, 1 beg your in- 
dulgence. 

As 1 look out upon you, out upon 
all the spaces of the land, the infer- 
ences of the landscape expose them- 
selves to me in all their beautiful, 
broken, blessed glory. An excess of 

154 



union — this is what 1 see and what I 
feel. One of my predecessors said 
from ai^roximately this same point 
many, many years ago that we 
gather here not for a victory of 
party but a celebration of freedom. 
Freedom. It is what we seek and it 
is what we shall together find — 

George, please, this is my ad- 
dress. Everyone already knows from 
your own speech what you intend 
for us; everyone already knows only 
too well — gratefully — of your loyal- 
ties as my second in command on 
the Centauri drill, and now as my 
wonderful and devoted Vice- 
President. What they do not know, 
but what I was and am still about to 
tell them, is that you have become 
my husband. 

No tears, George. No tears for 
any of us. Least of all before our 
billions and billions and billions and 
billions of friends. So . 

So we must humbly and proudly 
continue. We must all continue. 
And that is, of course, what I said 
to you, my dear brethren, near the 
tumpoint of the Centauri run, as we 
came to settle into single orbit 
around that doom-stricken and 
ruined binary. My dear brethren, I 
said, no, that is not quite right, 
George, 1 said, because naturally it 
was George I was talking to on the 
Skipstone and not my dear, dear 
brethren, George, we must carry 
on; we must successfully complete 
this mission not only because all of 
Earth is counting on us but because 
in the joyous accomplishment of 

GALAXY 




this first starflight resides hope for 
peace. 

George, I said, George, in the 
stars — salvationl 

You may recall, some of you 
may recall, that is, you may recall 
that there were those who laughed. 
There were those who scorned our 
great journey. There were those 
who said that the tachyons were as 
likely to fail as all the governments, 
and that if Skipstone did not self- 
destruct, the governments would. 
Or both. Very difficult for George 
and myself, as you can imagine. 
Very difficult. 

You have been extremely patient, 
but I promise I will not keep you 
much longer. Not much longer. 
Thank you once more for bearing 
with me, one and all. 

There is no need for that, 
George. Stop it. Please. 

Please. 

Oh my friends, my cherished 
friends, you must be able to see 
how moved is our darling George. 
But he got hold of himself in 
Skipstone and he damned well better 
get hold of himself here and now, 
please, George. 

We have unity. Unity. A perfect 
unity which swept us by unanimous 
vote — your unanimous vote and 
ours — 

Unity and Unanimity — 

Swept by unanimity just two 
hours later into the offices of Presi- 
dent and Vice-President of this 
great land; swept me into this inau-

DIRECTIONS 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

While I had foreseen the precipitation of a 
new military era caused by military lasers. 
Dr. Poumelle’s article, “Lasers, Grasers, 
and Marxists,’’ pointing out the inherent 
danger of a total nuclear war during the 
transition from the pre-laser era came as a 
shock. That the Soviet Union’s leaders could 
contemplate the loss of 40% of the Soviet 
Union’s population in order to make the 
world safe for their brand of communism be- 
came plausible. It becomes even more plau- 
sible when one remembers that the Soviet 
Union has a number of installations similar 
to our “nuclear-weapon proof” NORAD 
combat-operations center under Cheyenne 
Mountain, thus insuring that the leaders 
would not be part of the 40% casualty fig- 
ure. 

Even if this scenario is avoided, however, 
the likelihood of direct confrontations be- 
tween the Soviet Union and the United States 
would seem to be made more likely by the 
advent of airplane- and ICBM-eating lasers. 
Present 2S0-kilowatt lasers, which can cut 
metal and explode plexiglass cockpits are al- 
ready on the way to relegating aircraft to a 
purely logistical role. The development of 
self-critical lasers which would use the nu- 
clear energy produced by a gas-core reactor to 
make the gas-core itself a laser (“Science 
News,” 5/15/76) and produce, perhaps, a 
20-megawatt beam, could easily deal with 
ICBMs. Even a 10-megawatts/cm^ causes a 
metal target to become a plasma which gives 
off intense X-rays that would foul the elec- 

156 



tronic devices of any warhead (“L’Utilisa- 
tion Militaire Des Lasers” by W. D. 
Metz, “La Recherche, ” June, 1976). 

Once such lasers were deployed, both on 
land and in satellites (so it’s against the 
SALT I Treaty, treaties have been broken 
before), the Mother/Fatherlands would be 
protected. Aggression would no longer lead 
quickly to a cataclysm for both sides. War- 
fare would once again become more or less 
“conventional”. 

A possible scenario, for example, would 
be a two-pronged attack launched by the 
Warsaw Pact against Western Europe. One 
prong could sweep across the northern Ger- 
man plain toward the Low Countries, while 
the other prong would be launched through 
the Fulda Gap. In four days of heavy fight- 
ing, these armies might be able to reach the 
Rhine before tnxips stationed in the United 
States could reinforce the Allies. Such an 
attack would no longer be met with the 
threat of nuclear annihilation. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that al- 
though air and space home delivery of nu- 
clear warheads will have been checkmated, a 
nuclear bomb would make a dandy land 
mine, sort of an anti-army rather than anti- 
tank or personnel weapon. The pendulum of 
warfare might be swinging back to favor the 
defense. 

Concerning Dr. Pournelle’s article of 
Lovecraftian horror, “In the Beginning” 
(October, 1975), recalled some, musing I 
have done about Einstein’s General Relativ- 
ity. The very fact that Einstein’s General Rel- 
ativity theory leads to chaos and the possi- 
bility that Cthulthu may pop out of a naked 
singularity might mean that there is some- 
thing wrong with the theory. Interestingly 
enough, Hiiseyin Yilmaz of the Perception 
Technology Corporation has pointed out that 
while General Relativity is consistent with 
special relativistic first-order Doppler effects, 
it is inconsistent with second-order Doppler 
effects which have been established by ex- 
periments to a very high order of accuracy. 
This is another reason to have some doubts 
about the General Relativity theory. In 
“New Approach to Relativity and Gravita- 

GAUXY 




tion” (“Annals of Physics: 81, 1973), Dr- 
Yilmaz has developed a slightly different rel- 
ativity theory which predicts coiiectly all the 
Newtonian and post-Newtonian effects of 
gravity and is consistent to the second order. 
In fact, his theory only diverges from Eins- 
tein’s in the strong field and weak field lim- 
its. The strong field limit does not have a 
Schwartzchild singularity and Yilmaz’s 
theory does not lead to the usual “black 
hole’ ’ concept for collapsed stars. It leads in- 
stead to ultramassive stars which seem to 
have properties that resemble those of 
quasars, fliere are other differences between 
the two theories that might be tested. If the 
Yilmaz theory should prove to fit the data 
better, good-bye black holes and good-bye 
Cthulthu. 

Mr. Varley’s “Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance” 
was one of the more enjoyable stories I have 
read this year. The idea of a human-plant 
symbiotic team with the plant providing 
life-support, computation and company was 
especially clever, and the description of the 
energy-intake phase was delightfm. 

“Larval Stage” by Steven Utley did not 
make the grade. I can best express my “en- 
nui” with the story by asking the following 
questions: 

1) Who have the mass-minded Cygnians 
been fighting in order to have developed 
ships with shields and weapon systems? 
Weapon systems that amount to anything are 
not developed without a good stimulus. 
Surely ten years of more-or-less peaceful 
contact with the Terran Network could not 
have provided such a stimulus and surely die 
mass mind is not schizoid enough to fight it- 
self. 

2) Why did the Cygnians first visit Alpha 
Centauri (A or B?) IV instead of the Earth 
where the Terran Network Central is located? 
The visit to Alpha Centauri is even more 
puzzling when one considers the fact that 
Alpha Centauri is over a parsec further from 
the 61 Cygni system than the Earth is. 

3) Is there still contact between the indi- 
vidual Cygnians and the mass mind when the 
two are separated by a distance of 4.31 par- 
secs? If not, what happens to those Cygnians 



which are “severed” in this manna-? 

Keep up the good work with Galaxy'.

Indeed, a shift from offence to defence does 
seem historically overdue ... if I were a 
Soviet commander I would be quite nervous 
about launching an attack over the German 
border i those “army-eating landmines" 
could already be emplaced! As for “Larval 
Stage," (I) Previous contact between the 
Cygnians and other species is assumed, (2) 
Perhaps they thought it discreet to visit an 
outpost first, and (3) Yes: the Cygniar 
mass-mind is very powerful — and, besides, 
it isn’t limited to four dimensions! 

To the Editor 

There are those of us who can occasion- 
ally write fine science fiction. Like Kingsley 
Amis, like Howard Fast, like Myself. I have 
flashes of that splendid sf insight, but it isn’t 
really built into my psyche. And then there 
are those whose sf-sense is a part of them 
like the intelligent symbiotic plant is a part 
of die protagonist in GOTTA SING, GOTTA 
DANCE. I’m talking about bom science fic- 
tion writers. Like Heinlein and Tiptree. They 
naturally think tha' way. I’m talking about 
John Varley. Varley is a bom science fiction 
writer. 

In GOTTA SING, GOTTA DANCE Var- 
ley has fused pop art, mysticism, classical 
aesthetics, modem aesthetics and pure sensu- 
ality with the limitless imagination of the sf 
visionary. The ideas are well thought out, 
original, exploratory, and they come one 
right after the other. I think he’s original, 
which is perhaps a primo quintessence of the 
Great sf writer, and I think if he doesn’t get 
a Hugo for that goddamn story then I shall 
lose all respect for the award. 

The Nebula committee tends to be more 
open-minded toward young writers, I think, 
then the Hugo people. It’s time a major sf 
award went to a younger, innovative writer, 
and Varley has demonstrated that he is de- 

157 




serving.

Dear Mr. Baen; 

Mr. Geis took a step back from his view 
of fandom in the May Galaxy to give us two 
propositions about the human condition: that 
morality follows the human condition, and 
that alienation increases as the standard of 
living decreases. Though these are interest- 
ing, 1 must take issue with them. 

Starting with the last, I see no empirical 
evidence that affluence means more interac- 
tion with the enviroment and concern for 
human existence. One need only look about 
to see hundreds of thousands, millions of a 
lienated and dissatisfied people. When our 
machines make each of us self-sufficient 
physically and give us the illusion of being 
emotionally so, what else can happen? The 
poor person on the other hand must depend 
upon his family and neighbors for his ex- 
istence. If he feels alienated, he dies. 

The first theorem has, superficially at 
least, more backing, but there are at least 
two fairly modem examples of well-to-do 
peoples who stooped to barbarism. Nazi 
Germany produced the most technologically 
advanced industrial complex of its time and 
raised itself out of the worst depression the 
world has ever seen, yet was responsible for 
the rape of Europe and the murder of over 
four million Jews. Similarly, France had a 
comparitively high standard of living at the 
time of the Revolution, despite which there 
followed mass slaughters of political undesir- 
ables in the city squares. 

The distinguishing point of both occur- 
rences was that although neither was actively 
participated in by the mass of the people (Hit- 
ler never got an absolute majority of votes), 
neither were they condemned. Mercier re- 
ported the gardens of the Tuileries more 
luxuriant than ever in the midst of the Rev- 
olution. We need not have “the Arena on 
worldwide 3-D hookup" to have a barbaric 
society. 

One possible explanation of the rise of 

158 



man is simply social evolution. It is logical 
that as civilization becomes more advanced, 
more civilized, it should have found new 
ways to cope with age old problems. But I 
don’t have the final answer. A gold-leaf au- 
tographed copy of A Study of History to the 
person who answers that. 

Faithfully yours, 
Wayne Wolf

Dick replies: 

Dear Jim: 

It would take a great deal of research and 
time to detail the information that leads me 
to think that as mankind creates surpluses of 
useable wealth by “raping the planet” he is 
able to indulge in the luxury of greater wel- 
fare and other social amenities for more and 
more of the “disadvantaged” (those who are 
too stupid or emotionally knotted to cope 
with life’s problems successfully). 

I thought it was obvious. 

At the same time, of course, technology 
allows us to indulge our xenophobia more ef- 
ficiently, for less-than-noble reasons. But 
overall, I think technology has allowed us to 
improve living conditions, at least in this 
country. 

When have people NOT been alienated 
and dissatisfied? That is built into us, I 
suspect — an integral part of the human condi- 
tion, like having to die. 

However, I don’t really want to argue with 
a man who thinks that our machines have 
made each of us self-sufficient, when in fact 
technology has made us all more dependent 
on others for our basic needs. Most of the 
population used to be about 90% self- 
sufficient, on farms. Now we are all 
specialists and dependent on other specialists 
for everything. It is not only the poor person 
who must depend on others for life. It is just 
that for the others the dependency and vul- 
nerability is masked and ignored and has 
other labels. 

Now, if you’ll excuse, me, I must tend my 
garden, feed the chicks, make a pair of shoes

Dear Mr. Baen, 

How could you do it? Alter finally man- 
ages to gain control for just one column and 
you let Geis back in the command chair, 
that’s unethical, inhumane, cruel and antiso- 
cial. Anyone with a rudimentary intelligence 
can see that Alter is the greatest statesman of 
this century, and by keeping him locked up 
in the archives you and Geis arc immeasura- 
bly slowing down the progress of this great 
nation. What would the world be like today 
if some deformed entity like Geis had locked 
up Plato, or Cicero, or Locke, or Gandhi, or 
Marx; well, maybe they should have locked 
that one up. Why, if Alter were freed he 



could become an author or publisher, even 
an editor! Now don’t get your androsterone 
up James, I’m sure Alter would find a job 
for you somewhere, maybe in circulation. If 
Alter were freed he could even become Pres- 
ident, think of it, the country would finally 
be led by somebody without a perversion 
about tape-recorders or a Boston accent. We 
must fTM Alter! We must put him in control 
and let Geis live in the dungeon for a while. 
We must form a Freedom for Alter Society, 
if the fans out there ate interested all they 
need do is write. Join today, for Alter, for 
Freedom and Democracy, for America!! 

Sincerely, 
Charles Vane
