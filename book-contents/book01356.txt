Do you have a restless urge to write' 



If so, you have much in common 
with successful authors. 

Read how 12 Famous Writers arc 
helping people turn a restless urge for 
self-expression into success in writing 



There's something different about people who 
feel the urge to write. They have a spiritual 
hunger that sets them apart - even from family 
and friends. 

If you have known this burning need to write, 
you, too, may have the gift successful authors 
possess ... the recurring ache to put into words 
your innermost thoughts, your own experiences. 

Max Shulman started writing because “. it 
was write or bust.” Faith Baldwin, after 80 
novels, still says: ‘Tve never written exactly 
what I dreamed I’d w rite . you keep on try- 
ing.” Successful authors like these know that 
this restless urge for self-expression is perhaps 
the most important ingredient of writing suc- 
cess. But, they realize it can waste away if you 
don’t know' how' to get started writing, or if you 
hesitate to try. 

Several years ago they joined forces with 
Rod Serling. Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, Mig- 
non G. Eberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, 
Mark Wiseman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith and 
Bergen Evans, to form the Famous Writers 
School. They poured everything they knew 
about writing into a remarkable new' kind of 
professional training course which trains you 
at home in your spare time. You begin with 
the fundamentals of all good writing — then 
specialize in Fiction, Non-Fiction, Advertising 
Writing or Business Writing. 

Each of your assignments is examined by an 
instructor who is a professional w riter or editor. 
He goes over your work line by line, word by 
word, blue-penciling his changes right on your 
manuscript, much as an editor does with an 
established author. Then he returns it with a 
long letter of advice and guidance. 

This training works well. Our students have 
sold their writing to the Reader's Digest, 




Rod Serling s urge to write made him a 
leading TV dramatist (Twilight Zone, Pattern j 
Reejuiem for a Heavyweight) and won him 
six Emmy awards.

IF • Editorial 



LOOKING AHEAD 



I n the first eight years of Ifs exist- 
ence, from that first issue in 
March, 1952, until the end of 1960, 
the magazine had half a dozen edi- 
tors — Paul Fairman, Larry Shaw, 
Eve Wulff, James Quinn, Damon 
Knight and H. L. Gold. From 1961 
till now, the undersigned has been 
lucky enough to be running things 
. and lucky enough, too, to have 
won three Hugos with it as the best 
science-fiction magazine in the world. 

Enough is enough. A good time 
to quit is when you’re ahead. And 
so, with considerable nostalgia and 
some flashes of regret, we’re moving 
out of the way to make room for a 
new crew. 

Starting with the next issue, the 
Presiding Genius of If (and of the 
other Galaxy-group magazines as 
well) will be Ejler Jakobsson. Sf 
veterans will remember Jake as whil- 
om editor of Super Science Stories 
some years ago (History does repeat! 
Curiously, we edited that one before 
him too). What Jake will do as edi- 
tor you will be discovering as the is- 
sues roll along. We’ll be as interest- 
ed as you are in seeing what new 
slants on the science-fiction subject 
Jake will bring to bear . and we 
expect to be pleased with the result. 

And, in a way, we expect to be 
a little envious. 



F or, while there is much that is in 
doubt about the next few years 
for science fiction and for the human 
race, there is one thing that’s for cer- 
tain, and that is that it is going to be 
a time of excitement and a time of 
change. 

Just in the last decade we’ve seen 
such science-fiction dreams come 
true as men going into space, the 
first test flights of supersonic air- 
liners, the wide development of com- 
munications miracles like computer 
facilities on an ever-increasing scale 
and the growth of color TV. By the 
time you read this, men may be walk- 
ing on the surface of the Moon. 

For old-timers like most of us, who 
have discounted all these astonishing 
events because we lived with them 
for years in the pages of sf maga- 
zines long before they happened in 
the real world, these things already 
have a sort of quaint, old-fashioned 
sound; we’ve come to look for be- 
yond them, to stranger worlds and 
more remote times. And yet they are 
now a part of our lives. And with 
them, they bring a freight of conse- 
quences whose ends are far from 
being in sight. Riots . violence . 
campus confrontations and civil un- 
rest. Organ transplants and medical 
marvels to ease our lives on one 
hand; ever-increasing pollution of the

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes toaay.

environment and stresses on our nerv- 
ous systems on the other. What is 
happening in our society is only the 
reflection of what has happened to 
our capability of changing the world 
to suit ourselves. 

When we buy scientific progress, 
the commodity we really want to get 
is betterment of the world for every- 
one — betterment in tangible ways, 
through technology that gives us im- 
proved food and medicine, or better- 
ment in such intangibles as a clearer 
understanding of the basic laws of 
the universe. But the price we pay is 
not only money. We pay for energy 
in the coin of air pollution. We pay 
for better health in the coin of over- 
population. We pay for increased ca- 
pabilities in the field of defense in 
the heavy price of increased danger 
of war. 

Thafs not a bad thing in itself. 
“There Ain’t No Such Thing As A 
Free Lunch,” as Bob Heinlein said in 
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress 
some issues back; whatever we get, 
we pay for one way or another. But 
our bookkeeping isn’t up to strik- 
ing a balance in these cloudy areas. 
Is it worth while to have two cars 
in every garage, at the cost of two 
lungfuls of carbon monoxide in ev- 
ery driver? We can’t tell. We just 
don’t have any good way of measur- 
ing the Good Things against the Bad 
Things in this way, to find out if we 
are getting our money’s worth. 

Not yet. 

But there’s hope. There are ways 
now being developed of foreseeing 
the consequences of change in a 
quantitative way, so that one can be 



stacked up against the others. They 
may give us refined and useable an- 
swers before very long. 

And until they arrive, we have 
that cost-accounting system ol evalu- 
ating possible futures all of us have 
been using for some time now, the 
science-fiction story. For it’s still true 
that the best lens available with 
which to peer into tomorrow’s world 
Is in science fiction. Sometimes the 
oracle is a bit hazy in detail, cryptic, 
hard to understand. But that has been 
an oracle’s privilege since the days 
of Delphi and Nostradamus. 

And looking into the tomorrows 
of these fascinating and eventful to- 
days should keep science-fiction writ- 
ers pretty busy for some time to 
come. 

W e hope to be with you in that 
capacity from time to time; 
our real reason for cutting dbwn on 
editing time is to make a little more 
space in the day for writing. 

But we won’t be entirely absent 
in the editorial capacity either. We 
are going to stick around for a while 
as Editor Emeritus, which is the 
rough Latin equivalent for second- 
guesser, the fellow who looks over 
the shoulder of the people actually 
doing the work and criticizes. 

So thanks — readers, writers, art- 
ists, associates in one capacity or 
another — for the best part of a 
very interesting decade. We’ve en- 
joyed it. We hope you have. And we 
will be looking forward to the dec- 
ades to come.

THE 

TOWNS 
MUST ROLL 

by MACK REYNOLDS 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Hardin was the town cop and a 
good one . But the town was on 
tour in a foreign land and some 
of the natives were restless . 



I 

N ew Woodstock crossed the Rio 
Grande at McAllen and pass- 
ed through the Mexican city of 
Reynosa. 

There had been two fairly major 
sites on the American side of the 



border with excellent facilities for 
as many as ten thousand homes 
apiece but Bat Hardin and the ex- 
ecutive committee had checked to 
find that the next nearest site was 
at Linares, a full 254 kilometers to 
the southwest. They wanted to 
push on through and avoid the ne- 



7 





cessity of setting up for the night 
at some second-class or emergency 
site where there would be inade- 
quate supply facilities and other 
short comings. There would be 
enough of that when they got down 
into Central America and beyond. 

New Woodstock was a small town 
as mobile towns went, and they 
hadn’t the problems of some of the 
larger communities. The committee 
had handled all the required border 
formalities the day before so that 
there was nothing to hold them up. 
Bat Hardin leading, as usual, they 
strung out along the highway, some 
five hundred homes strong with the 
auxiliary vehicles spaced periodi- 
cally between them. 

Bat rode alone in his converted 
police vehicle, drawing his moder- 
ately sized mobile home behind. He 
was far from a misogynist but at 
this junction in his life he had no 
permanent feminine affiliations 
and for some reason not quite clear 
to even himself he desired none. He 
was a moderately tall man with a 
military carriage and a habitually 
worried expression. His hair was 
crisp, his complexion dark and his 
features so heavy that he would 
hardly have been thought of as 
handsome by average American 
standards. He had a nervous habit 
of gnawing on his under lip at the 
slightest of problems. 

He wore a khaki semi-uniform. 
Local police often had a chip on 
their shoulders in their attitude to- 



ward the pseudo-police of the mo- 
bile towns, who, after all, had no 
authority in the areas through 
which they passed. Law in the mo- 
bile towns was largely a voluntary 
matter; minor infractions could be 
taken care of in the community but 
any major matter made it necessary 
to call in the proper authorities of 
whatever area the town was in at 
the time. 

'T'his part of Mexico was not 
**• particularly attractive as Bat 
had known from earlier trips but 
the site at which they were to stay 
that evening was at the edge of the 
mountains and on the banks of a 
stream. And the following day they 
should be getting into the Mexico 
famed in story and song. 

At the thought of that, Bat Har- 
din grunted deprecation. The world 
was becoming one in more than one 
sense. The larger cities, in particu- 
lar, such as still existed at feast, 
were becoming unbelievably aEke. 
Somehow or other they all seemed 
to look like Cincinnati. He was 
hoping that it would be different 
in South America. 

A mobile town, like a convoy of 
ships in wartime, moves at the 
speed of its slowest member. Atone, 
Bat Hardin’s electro-steamer could 
easily maintain a steady five hun- 
dred kilometers an hour, at least on 
an automated underground express- 
way in the States. Even under man- 
ual control such as at present, three 



8 



IF 




hundred kilometers an hour was 
quite possible. However, the aver- 
age home behind him seldom got 
much above a hundred kilometers 
an hour especially when traveling 
in a group. 

He shrugged that off. He was 
used to this reduced spe&l and they 
were in no hurry. If they wished, 
they could take a year — or ten 
years — to reach their destination. 
He grunted at that, too. In actual- 
ity, they were rather vague on just 
what the destination was. 

What was really on his mind was 
the sullen quality that he had 
seemed to detect in some of the 
border officials. It was nothing he 
could quite put his finger upon and 
didn’t apply to all of the immigra- 
tions and customs people but it was 
there. And he didn’t quite know 
why. 

He said into his car phone, “New 
Woodstock, A1 Castro.” 

Al’s face faded in. “The rear 
guard here,” he said, yawning. “I’ll 
sure as hell be glad when we get 
up into the mountains a ways.” 

Bat ignored the complaint of his 
second. A1 Castro was a chronic 
complainer when things were going 
fine and never uttered a word of 
beef when matters were anxious. 
He was a good man and Bat some- 
times wondered at his presence in 
this community. A1 was no more of 
an artist than Bat was. 

Bat said, “We’ll be turning off in 
about a half horn:.” 



“Going to stop then for lunch?” 
“We’ll put it to the vote but 1*10 
going to recommend no. I’d like to 
get into Linares before dark. Some 
of the boys haven’t ever driven on 
these roads before.” 

“Yeah,” A1 grumbled. “I’ll call 
back to the old lady to whomp me 
up some sandwiches. Probably 
wind up with acid stomach.” 

The vote carried and in the ear- 
ly afternoon Bat unwrapped the 
two sandwiches he’d made himsell 
earlier and the plastic of beer. 
When he had finished the beer, he 
threw the container out the window 
without compunction. The plastic 
containers which dissolved in the 
sun or rain within a week spelled 
progress with a capital P in Bat 
Hardin’s book. Gone with the snows 
of yesteryear were the multi-mil- 
lions of beer and other cans which 
used to line the roads and clutter 
up the parks, beaches and resorts 
of half the world. 

Hphey were only to spend the 
one night at the Linares site 
so they made no particular efforts 
to arrange themselves in predeter- 
mined order, other, of course, than 
that the administration and other 
auxiliary vehicles parked in the 
center of their group. They occu- 
pied only about a third of the sitete 
most favored area and there w ease 
only half a dozen other mobBe 
homes. 

Bat himself parked near the ad- 

I P

ministration building, noting; that 
the driver, Milt Waterman, wasn't 
bothering to set it up but was mak- 
ing his way over to his father’s 
home to rejoin his family. Bat de- 
tached his electro-steamer from his 
home, to have it ready in case of 
emergency. He parked it, to Wan- 
der about on foot on the off chance 
that he could be of some assistance 
to someone setting up one of the 
larger and consequently more awk- 
ward homes. Jim Blake, for in- 
stance, could usually use an extra 
hand. Jim might be one of the most 
prominent artists in New Wood- 
stock but he wasn’t mechanically 
enough minded to wind a clock. 

Blake, however, had secured the 
services of one of his neighbors. 
Ferd Zogbaum, a bachelor, lived in 
what wfls usually called a camper, 
a very compact bus-like vehicle 
that combined the electro-steamer 
and living quarters very neatly. 
Ferd was usually on hand to help 
out when help was called for. A 
damn good member of the com- 
munity, Bat had long since decided. 

Everything seemed to be settled 
down and Bat Hardin fell in be- 
side Dag Stryn, the guru of the 
New Temple, and elderly Doc 
Barnes and headed toward the 
site’s ultra-market. 

He said to the town’s doctor, 
“How’s Mrs. Terwilliger?” 

Doc Barnes said, “She’ll be all 
right, Bat. I haven’t the facilities 
in the clinic to handle her opera- 
THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



tion but. I’ll stop off with her at the 
first city with an adequate hospi- 
tal. I have her in stasis for the 
time being.” 

“She and Phil will have to drop 
behind?” Bat said, nibbling on his 
lower lip. 

“Not necessarily. She can con- 
valesce in the clinic while we’re un- 
derway.” 

Dag Stryn, a blond Viking of a 
man but almost unbelievably gen- 
tle .in all things, said, “I’m worried 
about the Terwilligers. They’re our 
oldest, and I’m just wondering if 
this protracted a trip is the sort of 
thing they should be doing.” 

“Basically they’re both as strong 
as a couple of horses,” Barnes said. 
“They’ll be all right. You can’t just 
sit and die because you’ve readied 
your seventies.” 

The doctor must know, Bat 
thought. He was certainly pushing 
that age himself. 

They reached the ultra-market 
and stood at the end of a short 
line that had formed. 

When his turn came, Bat took 
up a number key and walked on 
past the display shelves, periodi- 
cally stopping before an item he 
wished and touching his key to the 
impulse device. Aside from tortillas 
and an inordinate selection of chili 
peppers, he could have been in an 
ultra-market in Maine or Oregon. 

He wasn’t, he realized, particu- 
larly happy about the fact. It must 
have been interesting, in the old 

n 




days, to be able to witness differ- 
ent cultures, eat exotic foods, sam- 
ple different drinks, ogle girls at- 
tired in saris or sarongs, rather 
than the now practically universal 
fashions. 

TTis selections all made, he re- 
*“* turned to the delivery coun- 
ter, put his number key in place 
and then slipped his pocket phone 
cum credit card in the appropriate 
slot. Within moments, his package 
erupted from the delivery chute 
and he picked it up and headed for 
the door. 

In turning abruptly, he caroomed 
against a newcomer, one of the 
community members named Jeff 
Smith. 

“Hey, watch yourself, boy,” the 
other snapped. 

“Sorry,” Bat said mildly. 

Smith grumbled something inar- 
ticulately and made off. 

Bat looked after him for a mo- 
ment. Jeff Smith was a fiery little 
man of about thirty-five, fairly re- 
cent to New Woodstock. He was 
supposedly a composer and had a 
small piano in his unusually large 
mobile home. Bat occasionally 
heard rambling music from the 
Smith quarters but to this point 
the other had never offered to play 
any of his compositions or any- 
thing else at any of the community 
entertainments. 

Bat shrugged and continued on 
his way. He hoped that Jeff Smith 
12 



worked out. In a mobile town there 
was small room for soreheads. You 
were either a tight community of 
cooperating fellows or you soon 
came apart as a town and dis- 
persed to seek better companion- 
ship elsewhere. Bat Hardin liked 
New Woodstock and would hate to 
see anything happen to it. It was 
unique as mobile towns went; in 
fact, to his knowledge, there sim- 
ply weren’t any other mobile art 
colonies in North America. 

He left his purchases in his 
home, decided to postpone his eve- 
ning meal and walked around the 
site a bit more, pondering the de- 
sirability of teaming together with 
some of the other singles such as 
Diana Sward or Ferd Zogbaum and 
taking turns cooking; not that he 
knew whether or not the others 
were any better in a mini-kitchen 
than he was. 

Thinking of Diana Sward, he 
came upon the girl sitting in a 
folding chair before her mobile 
home, an easel before her, a palette 
in hand and a scowl on her face. 
She was obviously trying to get the 
colorful mountain peaks to the west 
on her canvas. 

She looked up and grimaced. 
“The damn light is off. This Mexi- 
can light is different. You’d think 
it would be the same as similar 
countryside up in California, or 
wherever, but it isn’t.” 

Bat said mildly, “How can light 
be different? Light is light.” 



IF 




“That shows how much you 
know about it,” she snorted. “Sit 
down, Bat.” 

Ohe was potentially a very pret- 
^ ty young woman but made 
small effort to realize her poten- 
tialities. On the few occasions when 
she bothered to do herself up for 
some community affair or what- 
ever, she wowed them all, looking 
surprisingly like a brunette version 
of the ancient movie star Marilyn 
Monroe. 

Now she was attired simply in 
paint-bespattered shorts and there 
was a streak of blue down her right 
cheek where she had obviously 
touched her brush in an absent- 
minded moment of irritation. 

She said, “The hell with it,” and 
tossed the brush to the shelf of the 
easel. 

“Are you any good, Di?” Bat 
asked idly. 

She grunted her disgust. “Not 
very, but I make a modest living. 
I have a show or two a year and 
that usually puts me over the hump. 
Three or four idiots collect my 
stuff.” 

He was moderately surprised. 
“You mean you don’t have to call 
on NIT?” 

“NIT is for nitwits,” she re- 
torted. “Besides, I’m not eligible 
for it.” 

“How do you mean? I thought 
three quarters of this whole town 
depended on NIT. Surely I do.” 
THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



“But I’m an alien, you know.” 
“We’re all aliens in Mexico.” 

“I mean, I’m an alien in the 
United States. I’m not eligible far 
the Negative Income Tax. I came 
over from Common Europe as a 
youngster. When the Germanies re- 
united, my mother had to hustle 
out. Some of the new authorities 
weren’t too happy with the stand 
she had taken in the old days. My 
name’s actually Diana Von Swifird 
und Hanse — very impressive, eh? 
She was a Grafin.” 

“A what?” 

“Something like a countess from 
way back in the Kaiser’s day. She 
was also on the chauvanistk side 
and didn’t want to become an 
American. Since she seemingly had 
all the money she, and I, would 
need she didn’t become a citizen. 
By the time she lost her capital — 
mother was an ass with money — 
it wasn’t as easy as all that to be- 
come an American. With the ad- 
vent of NIT practically everybody 
in the world would have become 
citizens if the government would 
have allowed it.” 

She changed the subject *Bat, 
what in hell are you doing in New 
Woodstock?” 

He shrugged. “In any mobile 
town, even an art colony, you need 
other than artists, writers, mam- 
dans, sculptors and the rest You 
need, for instance, a cop or two.” 
“Sure, but I mean, what do you 
get out of it. There is no pay 

13 




with your position. Like you said, 
you live on NIT.” 

Tie said slowly, “I’m not by na- 
ture a loafer. Besides, I feel 
a need to identify, I suppose you’d 
call it. Be part of the community. I 
want to do my share ...” 

“Well, a mobile art colony is a 
sort of a strange place to have that 
drive.” 

“No it isn’t.” He looked at her 
from the side of his eyes. “I’m a 
cop, for free. Some of the others 
who don’t spend full time at their 
art act in helping on repairs, as car 
mechanics, teachers or whatever. 
For instance, why do you teach art 
classes to the kids three times a 
week?” 

“Touche,” she snorted. “But 
what I meant was, if you’re am- 
bitious to work and don’t want to 
be a loafer, why do you stay in a 
community like this? Why not get 
yourself a job up in the States?” 
“Di, old girl, we have a new so- 
cioeconomic system in our America. 
Today such labels as democracy, 
capitalism, free enterprise and such, 
are passe. We have Meritocracy.” 
“All right,” she said. “Drop the 
other shoe. So what’s Meritocracy 
got to do with you?” 

“Just this. The majority of our 
population is unneeded in our so- 
cioeconomic system. What John 
Kenneth Galbraith, the old econo- 
mist, once called the Technostruc- 
ture — in short, management — 
14 



has become for all practical pur- 
poses the entire working popula- 
tion. Practically everybody who 
works is part of management: from 
scientists, through engineers to 
technicians. The blue-collar worker 
is an anachronism. Happily — I 
guess — by this time production is 
at such a scale that the unneeded 
are not forced into starvation. Sim- 
ultaneously with the advent of Mer- 
itocracy came the movement to- 
ward Guaranteed Annual Income, 
the Negative Income Tax and oth- 
er floors beneath the income of ev- 
ery family in the country, employed 
usefully or not. In short, the dole.” 

Diana Sward said, “Damn it, 
stop lecturing me largely about 
things I already know. What’s this 
got to do with you not being a 
loafer, not going up and getting 
yourself a job?” 

He nodded, bitterly. “There’s 
not enough work to go around, Di. 
And that which is available re- 
quires both I.Q. and education. 
You need both. I.Q. without edu- 
cation is, of course, worthless, but 
you need the I.Q. to get the edu- 
cation — in the schools that count 
at least. I’ve never seen figures but 
I suspect that the average person 
who works today in American in- 
dustry has an I.Q. of something 
like 130. The number that have an 
I.Q. of a hundred or less must be 
infinitesimal. 

“Di, when you apply to enter a 
university, or, even if you get over 

IF 




that hump and graduate, when you 
apply for a position With any cor- 
poration in the nation, the first 
thing they do is check your dossier 
in the National Data Banks. And 
shortly after your name and iden- 
tity number is your good old In- 
telligence Quotient which they’ve 
been testing periodically ever since 
you entered kindergarden. When a 
fraction of the population can hold 
down all the jobs needed, why 
should any corporation in its right 
mind hire somebody with an I.Q. 
of less than 100?” 

“What in the name of God has 
that got to do with you?” 

“IVe got an I.Q. of 93, Di.” 

II 

Qhe stared at him. “Don’t be 
^ ridiculous. Why, you’ve been 
lecturing me like a professor of ec- 
onomics since I first met you.” 

He made a face of deprecation. 
“Don’t confuse learning with in- 
telligence, Di. I didn’t have much 
formal schooling. In fact, practical- 
ly none at all. When I was a kid we 
still had the ghettos and slums and 
my family was as lower class as 
you could get. But during the 
Asian War I copped one and was 
in the hospital for quite a spell. I 
learned to read there. No, I mean 
literally. Before that I couldn’t do 
much more than read comic books 
and sign my own name. I became 
a compulsive reader, an inveterate 



reader I suppose you ooB it I 
spend all my free time reading.” 
“Well, that shows you’re really 
intelligent.” 

“No it doesn’t,” he said dogged- 
ly. “All it shows is that I’m a com- 
pulsive reader. You can be stewish 
as far as intelligence is concerned 
and still do a lot of reading* You 
even learn the twenty dollar words, 
but you mustn’t kid yourself, it 
doesn’t make you any smarter. If 
your I.Q. is 90, it’s still 90. And in 
the Meritocracy it’s exposed. There 
is no room for the stupid.” 

She tightened her mouth in re- 
jection. “How do you know your 
I.Q. is 93?” 

He chuckled wryly. “When I 
first entered the army I worked for 
awhile in records. I sneaked a look 
at my induction examinations. By 
the way, what’s yours?” 

She made a gesture of shivering. 
“I’ve never tried to find out” 

“I don’t blame you,” he laughed. 
“Sometimes, I’m sorry that curios- 
ity ever hit me in the army. I’d be 
happier if I didn’t know.” 

She leaned forward. “But look, 
Bat, there are fields in which I.Q. 
doesn’t particularly enter. The arts, 
for instance. Some of the great ar- 
tists of the world were lamebrains. 
Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.” 
He spread his hands in a gesture 
of submission. “Yeah, but I haven’t 
any particular aptitude for any of 
the arts. Believe me, I’ve messed 
around in them.”

“But there are other fields ...” 
“Sure, and IVe held down jobs 
in some. I used to curry horses for 
one of the big mucky-mucks in 
Kentucky, down where one of my 
ancestors was a slave. But I don’t 
like being a servant.” 

“In a way, you’re a servant now, 
a public servant.” 

“All right. But, here in New 
Woodstock I’m an honored mem- 
ber of the community. With a few 
exceptions, possibly, I’m welcome 
in everybody’s home. I get invited 
to the parties, I’m often brought 
in for lunch or dinner. Hell, the 
Robertsons named their new baby 
after me.” 

She stared at him in frustration. 
He said doggedly, “Here I be- 
long. Here I’m wanted. Here I can 
be of use. The Meritocracy doesn’t 
need me and I refuse to sit around 
in the new America collecting my 
NIT and not being able to return 
anything of value to society. I 
don’t like charity.” 

“But you take your NIT.” 

He shrugged, once again in self- 
deprecation. “In the world as it is 
there is no other way to survive. 
Theoretically, perhaps, I could go 
off somewhere and be a hermit. 
But that’s theory. Man’s a social 
animal and can’t divorce himself 
completely from society.” 

J eff Smith, who seemed to be 
listing slightly to starboard, 
passed by them, heading back to 

16 



his home from the direction of the 
site’s cantina . 

He stared at them, his eyes par- 
ticularly going over Diana Sward’s 
semi-nudity. There was an element 
of sneer in his voice when he slur- 
red, “Yawl having a good time?” 

He had passed before either of 
them could think of anything to 
say. 

Bat chuckled. “I think Jeff 
sports the last of the southern ac- 
cents. He’s trying single-handedly 
to maintain the old provincialism. 
And what’s that chip on his shoul- 
der, anyway?” 

“He invited me to have a drink a 
little earlier,” Di said distastefully. 
“I turned him down.” 

Ferd Zogbaum came up, a scowl 
on his face. A scowl wasn’t normal 
on Ferd. He was an easy-going, 
generous type, about thirty, push- 
ing six feet and a hundred and six- 
ty pounds. He was as nearly uni- 
versally liked by everybody in New 
Woodstock as is possible to be 
liked without being completely 
wishy-washy. 

They exchanged amenities, and 
Di suggested he get himself a chair. 
She stood. “I think I’d better put 
on some more clothes, it’s cooling 
off.” 

Ferd said to Bat, “Could I talk 
to you a minute?” His tone indi- 
cated that he meant alone. 

“Sure. Why not?” Bat said, com- 
ing to his feet. “Let’s go over to 
my place. See you later, Di. 



IF 




Bat and Ferd sauntered along 
easily. It was the time day Bat 
liked best in the mobile art colony. 
Two of the younger set, known to 
be considering marriage, went by 
slowly, hand in hand. Off in the 
distance, a guitar, poorly played, 
was starting up a folk song. The 
kids were beginning to emerge from 
their homes; a ball game was shap- 
ing up. There weren’t many chil- 
dren in New Woodstock, slightly 
over a hundred, but their presence 
added a needed something, even to 
an art colony. 

Bat said to Ferd, in the way of 
make-conversation, “Getting any 
work done?” 

Ferd said, “Some people might 
work from sun to sun, but a writer’s 
work is never done.” 

Bat looked at him from the side 
of his eyes. “Oh? You don’t seem 
to be wearing yourself to a fraz- 
zle.” 

“I’m working right this very 
minute,” Ferd said, in put-on pro- 
test. “One of these days I’ll do an 
article about you. How’s this for a 
title, Last of the Neighborhood 
Cops?” 

“It’ll never sell. Do you place 
much of your stuff, Ferd?” 

“Some. Not enough to negate my 
NIT, but some. That’s one advan- 
tage of NIT, I suppose. Gives 
somebody who’s trying to break in- 
to the arts the opportunity to sur- 
vive while he’s learning the tools 
of his trade. 



“No more starving in garrets.” 

B at’s mobile home consisted of 
a fairly large living room, a 
mini-kitchen, a bath and a bed- 
room. In the tradition of house 
trailers, since their inception, ev- 
erything was compactly efficient: 
refrigerator, automatic bar, elec- 
tronic stove, TV screen, tucked 
away here and there with a mini- 
mum expenditure of space. 

Ferd slumped into an easy chair 
and Bat went over to to bar. 
“What’ll you have?” he said. 

“It’s been a hot day, how about 
a Cuba Libra?” 

“Sounds good to me,” Bat said, 
dialing the rum and coke and a 
dash of lime juice. He paused a 
brief moment, • then opened the 
compartment and brought forth 
two long, chill plastic glasses. He 
handed one to Ferd and look a 
chair himself. 

Bat said, “What was k you 
wanted to see me about, Ferd?^ 
Ferd’s face worked unhappily 
for a moment before he answered. 
“I don’t know exactly how to put 
it, Bat, but something’s wrong.*’ 
Bat looked at him. 

Ferd said, “I can’t put my lin- 
ger on it. It’s kind of intuitive. 
But, for one thing, where are to 
local people?” 

“How do you mean?” Bat said, 
scowling. He had run into this in- 
tuitive feeling of Ferd Zogbaum’s 
before. The other hadn’t been with 



THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



17 




New Woodstock very long but on 
two occasions he had come up with 
this intuitive feeling, or whatever 
it was, and had been astonishingly 
accurate. 

Now Ferd said stubbornly, “The 
last time I was in Mexico, about 
five years ago, the locals used to 
hang around a site when a group of 
American homes came through. 
Some were there just to gawk, but 
some had souvenirs and such to 
sell. Where are they this time?” 
Bat scowled again. “Damn if I 
know. Possibly so many Americans 
have been coming through that 
we’re no longer a novelty.” 

“That wouldn’t apply to ped- 
dlers, or beggars. It wouldn’t even 
apply to kids. Kids never get tired 
of gaping at strangers and differ- 
ent ways of doing things.” 

Bat thought about it, biting his 
lower lip. He said slowly, “Did you 
notice at the border this morning 
a, well, kind of a sullen quality 
about some of the authorities?” 
“As a matter of fact, I did. We 
had all of our papers, permission 
to enter and all but I got a distinct 
feeling that most of them hated to 
see us pass.” 

Bat said suddenly, “Look, what 
do you say we go into town this 
evening after we eat? Take a look 
around.” 

Ferd came to his feet, pulled out 
his pocket phone and dialed the 
time. “Okay,” he said. “I’ve got to 
get back over to Di’s now.” 



After Ferd Zogbaum had gone, 
Bat went into his mini-kitchen, 
opened the refrigerator-freezer and 
scowled in at the purchases he had 
made earlier. He wasn’t particular- 
ly hungry after the heat of the day. 

Tn honor of their first stop in 

Mexico, he brought forth a con- 
tainer-dish of chili con carne and 
placed it in the electronic heater 
and gloomily watched as the con- 
tainer top melted, becoming part 
of the prepared contents. 

The chili con carne heated but 
the dish remained at room temper- 
ature and Bat took the food over 
to the small table in the living 
room. From a cabinet he brought 
forth a box of utensils, some crack- 
ers and another plastic of beer and 
sat down to eat. He wasn’t going to 
need the knife with this meal so 
he ate it along with the chili. 

When he had finished, he ate the 
plate and the spoon and fork and 
went back to his favorite chair to 
wait for Ferd Zogbaum. He con- 
sidered dialing himself an after- 
dinner drink but decided not to. 
He had no idea of what they might 
run into in Linares and didn’t want 
to be even slightly befuddled. He 
reached up for a book from his 
shelves and sat again. 

Bat Hardin was getting fully 
emersed in the work when Ferd 
Zogbaum’s knock came at the door. 
He gave a grunt of displeasure, 
marked his page and got up.

IF 




Ferd’s camper was on the slow 
and awkward side, comparatively, 
so Bat suggested they take his elec- 
tro-steamer. Linares proper was 
about a kilometer down the road 
and it took them only minutes to 
arrive. 

The town of Linares boasted a 
small population of approximately 
14,000 and had little call to fame. 
The area was not particularly suit- 
ed to farming, mining nor, certain- 
ly, industry and since its scenic at- 
tractions were only moderate tour- 
ism was also a matter of little gain. 
Thus it was that the community 
had participated hardly at all in 
the growth of Mexico proper such 
as was to be seen in the progressive 
cities of Monterrey, Guadalajara, 
Vera Cruz and above all Mexico 
City itself. In fact, Linares re- 
mained a town of yesteryear, a 
sleepy, dull and at this time of the 
year, at least, dusty backwash to 
the days of Pancho Villa. 

The main highway, leading west 
and further on, south, compounded 
insult to injury by avoiding Linares 
proper. Bat and Ferd had to take 
a side street to the village zocco or 
plaza, the center about which ev- 
ery Mexican hamlet, village or city 
revolves. 

It differed not at all, except pos- 
sibly being amongst the least pic- 
turesque in all the Republic, from 
the norm. There was a park, a 
bandstand in its center, iron bench- 
es about the perimeter, patches of 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



sad flowers spotted here mid there. 
A score of trees provided perching 
for multitudes of Boat-tailed 
Grackles which evidently had no 
respect for weary townsmen slump- 
ed below on the benches. 

There were few cars parked 
about the square, and those that 
were there were more often old- 
fashioned internal combustion en- 
gines, rather than steamers or the 
more recent electro-steamers. Evi- 
dently pollution laws had never 
been enforced in Mexico. In fact, 
of wheeled yehicles there were more 
beaten up trucks and buses than 
private cars. 

Bat Hardin parked the electro- 
steamer in front of a bar and got 
out, Ferd doing the same on the 
other side. 

'T'hree or four indolent villagers, 
leani ng up against wall or 
lamppost, seemed to take displea- 
sure when Bat locked the car doors. 
He wondered idly if it was because 
they were thwarted in going 
through the vehicle, or if they were 
objecting to his suggesting that it 
might be done if he failed to lock 
up. Come to think of it, Bat re- 
called that in these small towns the 
crime rate in Mexico was said to 
be infinitesimal, though it could be 
different in the larger, more sophis- 
ticated cities. 

Ferd led the way. If the town as 
a whole had reminded them of a 
movie set based on the Mexican 



19 




revolution of 1910, there was little 
in the interior that would indicate 
the bar wasn’t a continuation of the 
set. The room was long, the walls 
decorated with bullfight posters 
and illustrations of bountifully bos- 
omed women. There was a brass- 
rail along the bottom of the bar 
and a tile trough with running wa- 
ter for those who must needs ex- 
pectorate. At the far end of the 
bar, along the whole wall which 
faced the door was a tile urinal 
which could easily have accommo- 
dated half a dozen beer discom- 
fited customers at a time. There 
was a stench of stale urine in the 
air, along with that of unwashed 
bodies. 

There were perhaps twenty im- 
bibers present, leaning on the pre- 
historic bar. Behind were three 
bartenders; one, a fifty-year-old 
pushing three hundred pounds in 
weight, was obviously the proprie- 
tor; the other two were youngsters 
in their teens. The liquor selection 
was limited; tequila, mescal, rum 
and gin. A battered refrigerator in- 
dicated that at least the beer and 
coke would be cold. 

Ferd muttered from the side of 
his mouth, even as they found a 
place, “Montezuma drank here.” 

“Or at least, Cortez,” Bat mut- 
tered back. 

A silence had failed upon their 
entry. The two Americans ignored 
it. 

The proprietor, who puffed 



slightly upon movement, hesitated 
for a long moment but finally came 
down to them, ignoring some of the 
cold stares of his habitufe. 

He stood before them, both ob- 
scenely fat hands on the bar, and 
said expressionlessly, “Senors?” 
“Tequila, por favor,” Bat said. 
He nodded, turned and secured 
a bottle of the white liquid midear 
bomb, a saucer of limes cut into 
quarters and a shaker of salt 
Both Bat and Ferd had been in 
the country before and knew the 
routine. They poured themselves 
drinks that would have been called 
triples in the States, took the salt 
and sprinkled a touch of it on the 
back of their left hands. They 
touched their tongues to the salt, 
took up and tossed the tequila back 
over their tonsils in one fell swoop, 
then grabbed up a quarter of the 
lime and bit into it. 

“Wow!” Ferd said, half in ap- 
preciation, half in objection to the 
strength of the fiery product of the 
maguey plant. 

The Mexican standing nearest to 
them and at Bat’s left, sneered and 
said in passable English, “Ah, not 
enough macho for tequila, eh, 
Gringo?” 

Ill 

TT'erd hesitated for a moment. 
** Finally, he said to Bat, 
“Well, we came here to learn. What 
does macho mean?” 



20 



IF 




Bat said quietly, “Manliness, 
more or less. The quality of being 
a real man.” He was nibbling un- 
happily at his lower lip. 

“And Gringo?” 

“It’s a derogatory word for an 
American. When the American 
troops invaded from Texas and 
Vera Cruz one of the popular songs 
of the day was Robert Burns’ 
Green Grow the Rushes, Oh, and 
the Americans sang it as a march- 
ing tunfc. The Mexicans of the time 
took the first two words and called 
the unwelcome invaders Green 
Grows or Gringos.” 

“Thanks for the lecture,” Ferd 
said politely. He turned to the 
Mexican. “And you’re just a 
greaser.” 

“Holy Smokes ...” Bat began 
in protest . much too late. 

The Mexican, although a small 
man by the standards of either of 
the two foreigners, pushed Bat 
Hardin to the side with a sweep of 
his right arm. He moved in fast, so 
fast that he should have been up- 
on Ferd before that worthy could 
erect defenses. However, the Ameri- 
can was prepared. Ferd went back- 
ward in the one, two, three shuffle 
of the trained pugilist, his hands 
coming up in fists. 

The Mexican was ardent but 
fighting out of his class as well as 
weight, height and reach. He swung 
once, twice, wildly. And then Ferd 
Zogbaum stepped in with a classic 
feint of the left and a crushing 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



blow into the other’s stomach with 
his right. 

Bat Hardin, meanwhile, had 
turned to meet the rush of the oth- 
er occupants of the bar. Unlike his 
companion, he adopted a crouch- 
ing stance, his hands slightly for- 
ward and held as choppers, rather 
than fists. He had not spent his 
long years in the Asian War with- 
out compiling background in hand 
to hand combat. 

The very number of the others, 
in the confined space of the can- 
tina, was their handicap. That and 
the fact that the locals had been 
knocking back the Mexican equiv- 
alent of the product of the vine 
considerably before the arrival of 
the strangers. They had fully the 
spirit of the thing but precious lit- 
tle science. While his companion 
was finishing off his attacker, Bat 
was able to hold them, although he 
was being pushed back slowly by 
sheer weight. 

Ferd yelled, “Let’s get out of 
here, Bat!” 

But Bat was nearly eliminated 
from the fray at this point by an 
attack on his flank. The bartender, 
something that looked like a child’s 
baseball bat in one of his fat paws, 
leaned over the bar and took a mas- 
sive swing at the embattled Ameri- 
can. Bat caught the motion from 
the side of his eyes and tried to 
swing out of the blow but only par- 
tially succeeded. For a moment the 
fog seemed to roll in when the 



21 




bludgeon struck him glancingly on 
the side of his head. 

Ferd caught him, supported him 
just long enough for the other to 
shake his head in an attempt to 
clear it. 

Swinging almost as wildly as the 
charging locals now, the two shuf- 
fled backward toward the swinging 
doors. 

“I’ll try to hold them,” Ferd 
yelled. “Get the car door openl” 

Tt was the obvious strategy. Bat 
**■ turned quickly and made a dash 
for it. In the street, he straight- 
armed one of the loungers who had 
been outside and who was now com- 
ing up on the run, obviously at- 
tracted by the sounds of the battle. 
Another was coming from the op- 
posite direction, a smallish young- 
ster probably not out of his teens. 
However, Bat Hardin had neither 
time nor patience for compassion. 
He slugged the younger man in the 
face, putting him down, and tore 
his car keys from his pocket. He 
fumbled at the door’s lock and felt 
a body hit him from the rear. 
Somebody threw arms about him. 

He reached back, snagged an 
arm and threw the other brutally 
over his shoulder in the old wrest- 
ler’s favorite hold, the Flying Mare. 

Ferd Zogbaum erupted from the 
cantina and slammed the doors 
back into the faces of the enraged 
enemy. 

The car door was open. Bat 
THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



Hardin darted in and snaked across 
the seat to the driver’s position. 
Ferd was still holding the rapidly 
emerging local citizens, his arms 
swinging like windmills. Bat Hard- 
in reached out and grabbed him by 
the belt and pulled him bodily in- 
side in a sprawl. 

The car began to move forward. 
Bat deliberately held down his 
speed so as not to seriously harm 
the two or three of the enemy who 
were immediately ahead, trying to 
stop him. They scurried to either 
side as he slowly sped up. 

Ferd had finally managed to sit 
erect and now slammed shut the 
still open door on his side. “Fun 
and games!” he yelped. “Get us the 
hell out of here, Bat. If any of 
those jokers are heeled, we’ve had 
it.” 

Bat growled, “This is a police 
car. They’d have to have anti-tank 
guns.” 

They were back on the main 
road leading out of town and to the 
site where New Woodstock was 
parked. 

“Armored, eh?” Ferd said and 
then, “Hey, you’ve got a nasty cut 
on your head.” He pulled forth a 
handkerchief and handed it over, 
then put a hand to his own head 
and groaned. 

Bat Hardin was driving with one 
hand and holding the handkerchief 
to the cut. “What’s the matter?” 
he asked. 

“Splitting headache,” Ferd mut- 



23 




tered. “I always get them, if I get 
into a fight.” 

“Damn it,” Bat said bitterly. “I 
always thought of you as an easy 
going character. What the hell was 
the idea of calling that guy a 
greaser?” 

Ferd groaned, still holding his 
head. “Listen, we had no more 
chance of getting out of that joint 
without a scrap than we have of 
flying without wings. Couldn’t you 
feel that in the air when we walked 
in? I just precipitated it before 
they got organized — thank God.” 
“More of your feminine intui- 
tion?” Bat said in disgust. He 
dabbed at his head and looked at 
the handkerchief. He was bleeding 
profusely. “I’ll have to take this 
to Doc,” he growled. 

They were approaching the site. 
Ferd looked over his shoulder. 
“None of them coming — yet.” 
“They won’t come,” Bat said, 
still in disgust. “There weren’t more 
than twenty or so of them, most 
tight. If we stuck around here for 
any length of time at all, they 
might stir up enough of the other 
townspeople to help them give us 
a hard time, but as of right now 
they’d be outnumbered. I suspect 
that the local cops, at this moment, 
are cooling them.” 

He pulled up before the colony’s 
clinic. 

D oc Barnes was sitting in a fold- 
ing chair out front talking 
24 



to his nurse who was also relaxed 
in the cool of the evening. 

Ferd muttered, “This head is 
killing me. I’ll go over to my own 
place. See you later, Bat.” He 
stumbled from the vehicle, head 
still in hands, and staggered away. 

Bat didn’t bother to answer. He 
got out of the electro-steamer on 
his side and started over to the 
colony physician. 

Doc Barnes looked startled and 
came to his feet. “What in the 
world’s happened? Miss Stevens!” 

Barbara Stevens hustled to her 
own feet and held open the door 
to the colony hospital. 

Bat headed into the interior say- 
ing, “Ferd Zogbaum and I went in- 
to town and got into trouble at a 

bar. ” 

Doc Barnes, following him, said 
grumpily, “I wouldn’t think either 
of you were the types to get into 
barroom brawls. Here, let me look 
at that.” 

Bat said, “They were laying for 

us, Doc. Haven’t you noticed the 
atmosphere?” 

“I can’t say that I have. Hold 
still.” 

“Well, we’re evidently not as 
popular around here as we might 
be.” 

The veteran doctor moved brisk- 
ly, staunched the blood flow, treat- 
ed the cut, closed it and placed a 
layer of pseudo-flesh over the 
wound. “There you are,” he said. 
“It’ll be healed in a few days.” 

IF 




“No stitches necessary ?” Bat 
said. 

“We don’t use them for that sort 
of thing any more,” the older man 
said. “You going to see Dean about 
this?” 

Bat turned to leave. “I suppose 
so. I’ll have to. Thanks, Doc.” His 
eyes swept the mobile clinic. When 
on the road, it moved in two sec- 
tions drawn by two heavy electro- 
steamers. When parked, and set up, 
it consisted of two floors, sporting 
twelve compartments in all includ- 
ing Doc Barnes’ living quarters. 

Bat said, “You know, this is the 
first time I’ve seen your set-up 
from the inside. It’s impressive.” 

Doc Barnes said, “You can thank 
Dean Armanruder and Jim Blake 
for that. They split the cost fifty- 
fifty and donated it to the colony.” 

Bat Hardin said, “Why did they 
donate this outfit? It must have 
cost a fortune.” 

“Contrary to some opinion, these 
mobile towns are not necessarily 
solely populated by bums on NIT,” 
Barnes said. “Some people, even 
well to do people, prefer to live 
this way. An art colony such as this 
will attract men like Armanruder 
and Blake because of the compan- 
ionship.” 

“That still doesn’t answer my 
question.” 

D oc Barnes said impatiently, 
“They donated it shortly be- 
fore you joined New Woodstock 



because I told them I wouldn’t take 
the position unless we had better 
facilities than were provided at 
that time.” 

Bat scowled. “What position? I 
thought you volunteered your ser- 
vices.” 

“I did. I’m retired and have all 
the income I need. Sort of an old 
workhorse that hates to be out of 
harness. I saw an advertisement in 
one of the magazines devoted to 
mobile town life for a doctor and 
answered it. New Woodstock’s doc- 
tor had passed away. Armanruder 
and Blake liked my qualifications 
and for the sake of their own selves 
and family members ponied up the 
necessary loot if I’d stay.” 

“Damn nice of them.” 

Doc shifted his thin shoulders. 
“You need a competent M.D. in a 
mobile town. It wasn’t completely 
altruistic on their parts.” 

Bat said, “Well, if you wanted 
to remain in practice, why didn’t 
you stay on up north?” 

The doctor said testily, “Because 
I’m outdated. In medicine today 
you become outdated about every 
five years. Normally, a competent 
physician will return to school ev- 
ery five years and spend one or 
two years catching up on the latest 
advances. I’ve got to the age where 
it’s too difficult to keep up. Be- 
sides, I like this life. I’m not so 
confoundedly senile that I don’t 
appreciate a change of scene, open 
air life, the beach or lakeside in the

summer, a southern climate in the 
winter.” 

Bat was beginning to feel better 
but he was in no hurry to go. He 
liked old Doc Barnes and suspect- 
ed that the other had been a top 
man of his field in his day. 

He said, “Were all the other 
auxiliary buildings acquired the 
same way?” 

Doc looked at him. “You should 
know, you’ve lived in mobile towns 
before, haven’t you?” 

“They sometimes differ in how 
they’re composed,” Bat said. “The 
only other one I’ve lived In was 
even smaller than this and specia- 
lized in archeology. There were 
precious few auxiliaries, and those 
largely inadequate, except for the 
mobile museum.” 

T he doctor shrugged. “As far as 
the auxiliaries are concerned, 
some, such as the ad building and 
the school, were bought by popular 
subscription when the town first 
organized some years ago. Others 
are privately owned. Sam Prager’s 
TV and electronic repairshop, for 
instance. Evidently, Sam had al- 
ways loved to tinker. When his job 
was automated out from under him, 
he and his wife Edith took what 
resources they had and made a 
down payment on a mobile home 
and equipped one room as a re- 
pair shop.” 

“I wondered why Sam joined 
New Woodstock,” Bat said. “You’d 
26 



think he’d look up some town that 
had a lot of members with similar 
interests in fiddling around with 
electronics.” 

“Edith writes. Poetry, I believe. 
She’s** on the striving intellectual 
side. Answer the question yourself, 
Bat. Why has a healthy, compara- 
tively young fellow like you re- 
tired to a life in New Woodstock?” 
Bat told him. 

The doctor was irritated. “The 
word intelligence has its elastic 
qualities,” he said. “Anyhow, one 
test isn’t enough, though the tests 
we use now are considerably more 
efficient than they used to be. 
However the I.Q. tests largely mea- 
sure the speed of your thinking, 
not necessarily its quality.” 

“How do you mean?” 

The testy old man said, “See 
here, suppose you were shipwrecked 
on a deserted island. Who would 
you rather have as a companion, a 
computer programmer with an I.Q. 
of 140 — gifted, in short — or a 
chappie with an I.Q. of 110, slight- 
ly above average, who was a pro- 
fessional fisherman and spent his 
vacations in hunting, hiking and 
skin diving?” 

Bat said dryly, “These days, 
you’re not apt to be shipwrecked. 
And under the Meritocracy high 
I.Q. is the criteria that counts.” 
“All right,” Barnes said. “Pos- 
sibly you know more about it than 
I do. But you’re building up one 
grand inferiority complex.” 



IF 




Bat Hardin turned to leave. He 
said, “It’s not an inferiority com - 
plex, Doc. I am inferior.” 

TJefore going to the mobile man- 
sion which was the home of 
Dean Armanruder, Bat Hardin 
headed for the considerably less 
ostentatious home of his deputy A1 
Castro. 

On the way he passed the camp- 
er of Ferd Zogbaum and consider- 
ed, momentarily, sticking his head 
inside and inquiring about the oth- 
er’s headache. It was a strange 
thing, that headache. What had 
Ferd said? That every time he got 
into a fight the headache hit him. 

He approached the camper but 
then drew himself up. Through one 
of the windows he could see Ferd 
sitting at his tiny desk talking 
earnestly into a TV phone. There 
was an anxious look on his face, 
one of strain, although he was 
seemingly trying to control that 
element of his expression. 

Bat shrugged and moved on. 
Since it seemed unlikely that the 
freelance writer had any contacts 
here in Mexico, he must have been 
communicating with someone back 
in the States and the conversation 
was evidently of more than passing 
interest. 

Bat shrugged again. For all he 
knew, Ferd was querying some ed- 
itor about an article. Possibly the 
strained element was there because 
he needed the money. But why 
THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



should Ferd Zogbaum particularly 
need money? He was a single fel- 
low and eligible for his NIT. He 
could go all year without selling 
any of his pieces, and never be 
really up against it, particularly 
since mobile town life was compara- 
tively cheap and Mexico, in partic- 
ular, considerably less expensive 
than the States. NIT, these days, 
was enough that anyone on it 
could live-it-up in Mexico or some 
of the other Latin American coun- 
tries to the south. And more and 
more people were discovering the 
fact every day as witness the exo- 
dus of mobile towns and cities 
southward. 

A1 Castro’s home was approxi- 
mately the size of Bat’s own but 
since he lived with his well larded 
wife, Pamela, the space was really 
less than he could have wished for. 
The place was lighted up but the 
curtains drawn. Bat rang the bell. 

A1 came, yawning as ever, and 
opened up. 

"Hi Bat, what’s on? Come on 
in, have a drink.” 

Pamela Castro was sitting at the 
small dining room table, a tall 
frosted glass there and a wilted 
look about her. She was an objec- 
tionably fat woman, and Bat had 
never particularly got along with 
her. She couldn’t see any reason 
for her husband donating his time 
as Bat’s deputy when he received 
no compensation. Theoretically she 
was a water colorist but in actuality 

27 




she spent precious little time work- 
ing at it. 

Bat said, “No thanks. I just had 
a drink and got knocked for a 
loop.” 

“They got strong liquor down 
here, all right,” A1 nodded. “But 
it tastes like turpentine. Take the 
tobacco stain right off your teeth. 
I’ll stick to State-side grog.” 

“It wasn’t the liquor,” Bat said 
wryly. “It was the bartender. He 
slugged me with a baseball bat.” 
A1 Castro stared at him. 
“What ’re you talking about?” 

Bat told him what had happen- 
ed. “I’m heading over to see Ar- 
manruder. But whatever he says, 
I think we’d better post a guard 
tonight. Why don’t you round up 
a couple of the emergency depu- 
ties, say Jake Benton’s boy, Tom, 
and Luke Robertson? We’ll share 
watches, four hours on, four hours 
off.” 

“Heavens to Betsy,” Pamela 
complained in a half whine. “Is 
this getting to be an all day, all 
night thing? What do you get out 
of it, up and down all night? You’ll 
be too tired to drive tomorrow.” 
A1 didn’t answer her. He turned 
back to Bat. “Okay, I’ll run over 
and get Tom and Luke.” 

T>at made his way across the 
" center area to where Dean 
Armanruder was set up not far 
from the mobile administration 
building. The senior member of the 



executive committee this week had 
by far the most luxurious mobile 
home in New Woodstock. His three- 
section establishment was a far cry 
from the little original trailer 
homes. Six vehicles in all were in- 
volved, three mobile homes which 
folded quite compactly while un- 
derway and three heavy electro- 
steamers which drew them. Two of 
the homes were joined on setting 
up to make the quarters which 
Dean Armanruder and his secre- 
tary occupied; the third home, con- 
siderably the smallest, was parked 
nearby for Manuel Chauvez and 
his wife, the only two servants in 
New Woodstock. 

Bat Hardin was on friendly 
enough terms with the retired cor- 
poration manager but found no 
real warmth in the man. In theory, 
Dean Armanruder dabbled in 
painting but in actuality such real 
professionals as Diana Sward had 
to repress their shudders if they 
were unlucky enough to see his lat- 
est product. 

Armanruder was a phenom- 
enon that has been known to the 
art colony down through the ages, 
the outsider who loves to associate 
with Bohemians — whatever a Bo- 
hemian is, Bat thought sourly. 

The Armanruder home was one 
of the few in New Woodstock that 
boasted an identity screen in the 
door. Bat activated it and stood 
there waiting for the door to open. 

It did, and Armanruder’s voice 

IF 



28 




came through the screen at the 
same moment. “Come in, Hardin. 
Good evening. We’re here in the 
salon.” 

“Good evening,” Bat said and 
made his way down the short cor- 
ridor to where Dean Armanruder 
and his secretary, Nadine Paskov, 
were relaxing before the TV screen 
which was built into the end wall 
of the room, taking up most of it. 

When set up, the mobile man- 
sion had a second floor which tele- 
scoped down into the bottom one 
when underway. The top floor was 
devoted to sleeping quarters, dress- 
ing rooms, closets and baths and 
Bat had never seen it. The ground 
floor was living quarters, library, 
dining room, a surprisingly exten- 
sive kitchen for a mobile home, 
storage space, a large office and a 
smaller one for Miss Paskov. Na- 
dine Paskov was really a secretary 
though some snide elements in the 
colony prefered to doubt that. She 
also obviously doubled as Dean 
Armanruder’s mistress and was un- 
doubtedly the most beautifully 
groomed woman in town unless Di- 
ana Sward held that honor. 

Dean Armanruder touched a 
control of the arm of his overgrown 
chair and the lights went up suffi- 
ciently for them to see each other 
more easily. 

“Sit down, Hardin,” he said. 
“Could I have Manuel bring you 
a drink?” He touched another con- 
trol. 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



'T'hat was the Armanruder style. 

Not for him an automatic 
bar nor even an old-fashioned one 
which he would have to operate 
himself. 

Cool it, cool it, Bat told him- 
self. What business of his was it? 
Armanruder had earned his com- 
forts. You didn’t become manager 
of a corporation these days because 
your father owned most of the 
stock. The wealthy might inherit a 
concern nowadays but few were 
foolish enough to attempt to oper- 
ate it themselves. 

He took the chair proffered but 
said, “No thanks. I’m going to be 
up half the night, and a drink 
would probably make me that much 
more groggy.” He nodded to Na- 
dine Paskov, ever the beauty 
queen, who looked as though she 
was bored by his arrival. "Good 
evening, Miss Paskov.” 

“Hi Bat,” she said, finishing the 
drink in her cocktail glass. 

Manuel entered but for the mo- 
ment Dean Armanruder ignored 
him. The small, dark-complexioned 
servant wore a white jacket now. 
During the day, while driving one 
of the Armanruder units, he wore 
a dark suit and a chauffeur's cap. 

Armanruder said to Bat, "How 
do you mean, you’ll be up to- 
night?” 

Bat told him the day’s develop- 
ments and the older man was ob- 
viously disturbed. “Why in the 
world did you two go into town?” 

29 




“I told you that. We sensed a 
sullen quality and wanted to check 
up on it. We certainly weren’t look- 
ing for trouble and would have 
avoided it if we could.” 

“I suppose so,” the other said, 
then looked at his butler cum 
chauffeur. “Two more of the same 
for Miss Paskov and me, Manuel. 
Mr. Hardin isn’t drinking.” 

“Yes sir.” The Spanish Ameri- 
can tinned to go. If Bat had it 
correctly, Manuel and his wife, 
Concha, had come from New Mex- 
ico or Arizona. Their Spanish 
would be invaluable on this town 
move to South America. 

Bat looked after the slightly 
built servant and must have had 
an element of questioning in his 
face. 

D ean Armanruder misunder- 
stood it. He said, “You’re 
wondering why Manuel would take 
a job like this in these days of 
NIT? It’s a fact that servants are 
few indeed in the States any more. 
Only the truly wealthy can afford 
them. But it’s not that with Man- 
uel and Concha; I pay them little 
more than they would get in the 
way of NIT. Poor Manuel is over 
a barrel. He’s not eligible for NIT.” 
“Oh? I was under the impres- 
sion he was an American citizen.” 
Armanruder chuckled again. 
“Yes. But not all citizens are eli- 
gible for NIT. You see, friend 
Manuel was caught at falsifying 

30 



his income tax. He and his wife 
were collecting their NIT but 
working on the side to augment 
their fortunes. Very, very bad. 
When the computers check you out 
and catch you, you’re no longer eli- 
gible for Negative Income Tax and 
in this day and age of unemploy- 
ment you have your work cut out 
finding a position.” 

Bat said, “Actually, that wasn’t 
what I was thinking, though. The 
thought went through my mind, 
there but for luck go you or I.” 
Nadine Paskov said in bored 
impatience, “Oh, good heavens.” 
Armanruder shook his head. 
“Speak for yourself, perhaps, Hard- 
in, but not for me. Luck is not in- 
volved. Manuel Chauvez and I 
come from different strata in so- 
ciety. It was fated that he occupy 
his position and I, mine. At his 
birth he was slated to be a servant 
or the equivalent, I to be among 
the top one percent of our system.” 
He settled back into his chair, 
made a dome of his fingers and his 
tone became slightly pompous. 
“Under the Meritocracy you seek 
and reach your level. It’s a system 
that fits the human race because 
it’s one that is stratified, because 
people are. It’s highly disciplined, 
because the universe is. It’s a so- 
ciety in which individuals can free- 
ly move from one level to another 
but only by their own abilities. 
Nothing counts except your own 
individual achievements.” 



IF 




Nadine Paskov finished her 
drink and tapped the back of her 
hand to her month. 

Bat had a few arguments in 
mind but he stood and said, “I 
should be getting on my rounds.” 
He added wryly, “I suppose the 
manner in which we do the little 
governing that is needed in these 
mobile towns is the last of the old 
time democracy.” 

Armanruder chuckled. “Yes. 
And do you see who our fellow 
townsmen elect to the executive 
committee? We who, before retire- 
ment, were most successful in our 
positions in society. You don’t find 
men like your impetuous friend 
Zogbaum on the executive com- 
mittee.” 

As Bat Hardin walked back to 
^ his own home, with the in- 
tention of getting a few hours sleep 
before relieving A1 Castro, he mut- 
tered, “No. And you don’t see me 
on the executive committee, eith- 
er.” 

It came to him that high intelli- 
gence wasn’t the only requirement 
to get to the top in his each-man- 
for - himself - and - the - devil - 
take - the - hindmost world. You 
had to have the push and aggres- 
sion of a Dean Armanruder. You 
had to have the desire for power. 
When Armanruder had first come 
to the mobile art colony, he had 
begun operating, volunteering his 
services, taking over responsibiii- 
THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



ties. Most of the town’s members 
did a minimum of participating in 
its required community work. Oh, 
there were few complete shirkers 
too taken up with his art work, his 
family, the maintenance of his mo- 
bile home to find time for lengthy 
committee meetings, the handling 
of accounts, the making of deci- 
sions involving the community. 

Within a month, Dean Arman- 
ruder had been elected to the exe- 
cutive committee and within two 
months was dominating it 

Bat relieved A1 Castro at ten 
o’clock and patrolled the town with 
Luke Robertson, a tall, lanky, slow 
moving fellow who did sculpturing 
in iron and who seemed to have 
an inordinate affection for Bat 
Hardin, as did his wife, for that 
matter. Bat wasn’t quite sure why. 
But when somebody likes you, for 
whatever reason, you have a ten- 
dency to like him in return. In act- 
uality, Bat had to admit that he 
didn’t appreciate Luke’s work; in 
fact, it was exactly the sort of ab- 
stract, meaningless — to Bat Hard- 
in — sort of thing that he actively 
disliked. Bat’s tastes went to the 
representational art forms; even 
free verse left him with a taste in 
his mouth. Of course, he had never 
mentioned that to Luke Rob- 
ertson. 

A1 Castro and young Tom Ben- 
ton had reported their four-hour 
watch uneventful. They had im- 
mediately taken off for their re- 

31 




spective homes upon the approach 
of Bat and Luke. 

And the hours between ten and 
two were equally free of any signs 
of disgruntled locals. In fact, Bat 
was beginning to wonder if the 
whole idea of posting a guard 
hadn’t been somewhat ridiculous. 
He was undoubtedly exaggerating 
the event in Linares. A bunch of 
drunks had lit into him and Ferd 
Zogbaum. So what? It didn’t mean 
that a mob was going to descend on 
New Woodstock. 

At two, A1 and Tom came back, 
A1 looking as though in the midst 
of the self-same yawn he’d had 
four hours earlier. Bat returned to 
his mobile home, slept four hours 
more and came back for the final 
shift at six. 

It was unnecessary. At this time 
of the year, it was dawn and early 
risers in New Woodstock were al- 
ready up and around. 

On the way back to his place, 
more sleep in mind, he passed Di- 
ana Sward, once again seated at 
her easel and. once again scowling 
at the mountains beyond. 

Bat looked over her shoulder for 
a moment at her efforts. “You’ll 
never make it,” he said, shaking 
his head. 

“Shut up. Good morning, Bat. 
When do we roll?” 

“I wouldn’t know. I’m in favor 
of getting out of here but I imag- 
ine it will be ten o’clock or so, as 
usual.” 



Something was there that he 
didn’t like. He couldn’t put his fin- 
ger on it. Maybe he was associat- 
ing with Ferd Zogbaum too much. 
Ferd and his intuitions. Maybe 
they were rubbing off on him. But 
he had the something-is-bad feel- 
ing. 

T Te went back into his home, 
* -■* opened a drawer and stared 
down at the Gyro-jet pistol there 
in its shoulder harness. He took a 
deep breath, took it out, took off 
his j’acket, shrugged into the har- 
ness, put his jacket back on and 
left the home again. 

He got into the electro-steamer 
and dialed a map of the local road 
system on his TV phone screen. He 
traced their route for the day, with 
a finger. The next stretch was 10S 
kilometers and led largely through 
the mountains. At the end of the 
stretch they would j’oin the Pan 
American Highway about 130 kilo- 
meters south of the city of Saltillo. 
The Pan American Highway was 
well patrolled, had ample sites 
strung along it and endless power- 
pack outlets and stations for fuel 
cells for those who used them. He 
would feel happier when they were 
upon it. As it was, this stretch be- 
tween Linares and the little town 
of San Roberto was going to be the 
most remote that they would trav- 
el over in Mexico. 

He made a sudden decision, 
checked his power packs which he 

IF 



32 




had charged during the night, ac- 
tivated the car and started up. He 
picked up his phone and said, “New 
Woodstock, Dean Armanruder.” 
But it was Nadine Paskov’s face 
which faded into the screen. She 
was obviously in bed and for once 
the glamorous secretary was less 
than her best. 

She looked at him sleepily and 
indignantly and said, “What in the 
damn world do you want at this 
time of the night?” 

Bat said mildly, “Sorry. I want- 
ed to let Mr. Armanruder know I 
was going to take a quick scout 
along the route we’re taking today. 
I assume that I’ll be back before 
the town takes off. If not, I’ll re- 
join along the route.” 

She muttered something and 
flicked off. 

It wasn’t necessary to enter Lin- 
ares proper to continue on along 
the highway, for which Bat Hard- 
in was thankful, although he rath- 
er doubted the town would be 
awake this early. Mexicans are 
seldom early risers as he had found 
out from his previous visits. Per- 
haps it went back to the old days 
when they were without means of 
heating their homes and remained 
in bed until the sun had warmed 
up the world. 

He drove along Route E-60, the 
road rather rapidly ascending. It 
was considerably more beautiful a 
drive than had been the day be- 
fore with its flatness of country- 



side; however, Bat Hardin wasn’t 
particularly observant of scenic 
values. He still had his premoni- 
tion and chewed away at his heavy 
lower lip as he rode. There didn’t 
truly seem to be anything un- 
toward. 

^T'hey nailed him about five kil- 
ometers before he reached the 
tiny hamlet of Iturbide and about 
fifty kilometers out of Linares. 
There was a road block of three 
cars, only one of which was a 
steamer and it is an old-fashioned 
kerosene burner, by the looks of it 

Four men, two of them in uni- 
form which Bat didn’t place and 
all of them armed, stood before the 
road block. 

Bat came to a halt and activated 
the window. 

One of the civilian-dressed of the 
four came over and said, “Senor 
Hardin? Come out, please.” His 
English was at least as good as 
Bat’s own. 

Bat opened the door and came 
forth, scowling. He said, “How did 
you know my name?” His eyes 
went over them. The alleged uni- 
forms were obviously make-shift. 
He snapped, “You’re not police!” 
His hand shot for his snoulder 
holster. 

Bat Hardin was not slow at the 
draw but the Mexican was a blur. 
His own pistol was out and trained 
on the American’s stomach. 

He said softly, “Move much 



THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



33 




more slowly, Senor Hardin, and 
give me that for which you were 
reaching. So. You carry a gun here 
in Mexico. To shoot Mexicans 
with, undoubtedly.” 

Bat brought forth the gun and 
handed it over. He said, “I have a 
permit issued by your border au- 
thorities. Our town is going all the 
way down. At least to Peru. Un- 
doubtedly, we’ll go through some 
fairly wild country in places Hk<» 
Columbia and Ecuador. So we have 
various guns. They weren’t meant 
to be used against the citizens of 
this country.” 

He submitted to a frisk by the 
other, who relieved him of his 
pocket phone. 

The Mexican stuck Bat’s Gyro- 
jet pistol in his belt and said, 
“You’ll never reach Peru or Ecua- 
dor, Senor Hardin. This way, 
please.” He indicated with his gun 
the more modern of the three cars. 

“Where do you think you’re tak- 
ing me?” 

“It is not a matter of mere think- 
ing, Senor Hardin. Just to make 
matters clear, I would not particu- 
larly mind shooting you.” 

Bat climbed into the seat next 
to that of the driver. Into the back 
climbed one of the uniformed men, 
a short carbine at the ready and 
trained at the back of the Ameri- 
can’s head. 

The English-speaking one took 
the driver’s seat and started up. 
They had to wait a half minute for 



the engine to heat; the steamer was 
that old a model. 

“What am I supposed to have; 
done?” Bat demanded. 

The other ignored him and said 
something in Spanish to the Mexi- 
can in the rear. That one threw 
what seemed to be a towel over 
Bat’s eyes and tied it roughly. Bat 
winced when his cut on the ride of 
the head had pressure applied to 
it. 

They drove only a few minutes 
before taking off on what was ob- 
viously a side road. They went on 
for perhaps two kilometers, appar- 
ently climbing rather steeply. 

'C'inally they came to a halt and 
-*■ car doors opened. There were 
other voices now, in the back- 
ground, all speaking Spanish. Bat 
was taken by each arm, not espe- 
cially roughly, and led forward. 
They entered a house, led him 
down what was evidently a hall and 
sat him in a chair. 

A new voice, an older voice and 
a highly cultured one, said, “Ah, 
Mr. Hardin. You do not look like 
a villain, Mr. Hardin. But I sup- 
pose you do not know that you are 
a villain. Villains seldom think of 
themselves as villains, I under- 
stand. They usually think they are 
terribly put upon and only doing 
what is correct.” 

Bat snapped, “What is the mean- 
ing of all this? I don’t have the 
vaguest idea of why you’ve grab- 

IF 



34 




bed me, or what’s going on. How 
do you know my name?” 

“That’s not important, Mr. 
Hardin, and we are not particularly 
interested in you. Any of your 
town authorities, or even an ordin- 
ary member of your community 
would have done. It is just that 
circumstance made it you, rather 
than someone else. We wished to 
issue an ultimatum.” 

“An ultimatuml” Bat snapped. 
“I’m beginning to suspect you’re 
all around the bend. What was the 
idea of stopping me, dressed in 
those phony uniforms? You’re not 
Mexican officials, certainly you’re 
not police.” 

“But we are Mexicans, Mr. 
Hardin, and in a way even police. 
Vigilante police. And here is our 
ultimatum. Your mobile town of 
New Woodstock must turn about 
and return to your own country.” 
“We applied for and received 
all permissions required by the 
Mexican authorities to pass through 
the country and exit through Gua- 
temala.” 

“We do not agree with some of 
our authorities. They are overly 
conscious of the American dollars 
spent by you tourists, you vaca- 
tioners and you who permanently 
establish yourselves in our country 
and devastate it and corrupt our 
young people with your money, 
your lack of common decency in 
your moral code, your bad taste.” 
Bat began to say something but 



the older man interrupted him. 
“When I was a boy, you used te 
cross the border in ones and twos, 
some as ordinary tourists, some in 
their house trailers. We welcomed 
you, welcomed the dollars you 
spent in our country. It must have 
been at the time of the 1968 Olym- 
pics that the dam first broke. That 
year, not scores or even hundreds 
of your trailers and mobile homes 
crossed but literally thousands. 
And that was just the beginning. 
When you established your fan- 
tastic Negative Income Tax and 
millions of your people were sud- 
denly free to leave America’s over- 
crowded cities with their slums and 
ghettos, then they swarmed out 
over not only your own land but 
Canada and above all Mexico, as 
well.” 

A new voice, / a younger voice 
but still in English, added, 
“And now my own country, Guate- 
mala and the other nations to the 
south. Everywhere, everywhere, 
your damnable mobile cities de- 
stroy the countries in which they 
park.” 

“Look,” Bat said. “We pay our 
way. We spend plenty in every 
country we go through or remain 
in. Your people benefit by the dol- 
lars we spend.” 

The older man’s voice came 
again. “A few benefit. Most of us, 
not at all. Our way of life, our cul- 
ture, is destroyed. The sites in 

W 



36 




which you stay, government-built, 
are government operated. The gov- 
ernment collects for the power you 
buy, it collects for the expenditures 
yoti make in the ultra-markets, 
restaurants and cantinas located on 
each site. Admittedly, the money 
realized is used by our authorities 
in their grandiose attempts to speed 
up the industrialization of Mexico. 
But some of us are not even sure 
that we wish to be industrialized to 
the fantastic extent to which you 
of the north have accomplished.” 
Bat began to retort, but the oth- 
er overrode him. “Mr. Hardin, 
Mexico’s relationship with the col- 
ossus to the north has not been a 
happy one, by and large. The flag 
that flew over the Alamo and was 
captured by Santa Anna’s army 
was that of a volunteer troop from 
New Orleans. And did you know, 
Mr. Hardin, the big reason the 
Texan revolt took place? Most of 
the American immigrants were 
from your southern states and 
couldn’t bear the fact that Mexico 
had abolished slavery. But Texas 
was not enough. Border trouble 
was provoked and what are now 
your states of Arizona, New Mexi- 
co, California and parts of others 
were also seized. The fact that the 
seizure was pre-meditated is to be 
seen in the fact that your General 
Fremont and his army had treked 
all the way to California before the 
war was declared and were ready at 
hand to capture that area.

“But all that is past history. It 
is the present to which we object. 
Your New Woodstock is but a 
small town, comparatively. Your 
mobile cities come and completely 
dominate our country. The best 
beaches from Tijuana to the Guate- 
mala border and from Matamoros 
to Yucatan are crowded with them. 
Manzanilla, for instance, once a 
small fishing town and resort, now 
has no room for Mexicans on va- 
cation. Thousands upon thousands 
of your luxurious mobile homes 
cover every desirable spot. Every 
restaurant is full of your people, 
every bar, every nightclub over- 
runs with them. Your hordes eat 
up the best products of our seas 
and our fields and orchards. With 
your fantastic incomes, you shame 
a Mexican, make him appear a beg- 
gar in comparison. In such resorts 
you run up the prices astronomi- 
cally so that we can no longer buy 
any luxury items.” 

The older sounding man snorted 
in contempt. “What is your current 
Per Capita Annual Income? Some- 
thing like $40,000?” 

Bat said sourly, “Precious few 
of us who live in mobile towns have 
incomes approaching that.” 

“But nevertheless, even a com- 
paratively well-to-do Mexican sel- 
dom sees the amount one of your 
people gets in what you call NIT.” 
Bat said angrily, “If you people 
would cool your population explo- 
sion a little your Per Capita in- 



37 




come would go up too. Your popu- 
lation increases almost as fast as 
your industrialization.” 

T he first voice he had heard, 
that of the leader of the 
group that had captured him spoke 
then and bitterly. “We do not need 
lessons in the manner in which to 
control the size of our families, 
Senor Hardin. One of our greatest 
objections to your presence is the 
manner in which you spread your 
corrupt moral code” 

The old voice came again. “How 
can our people get underway when 
the intellectual drain bleeds us 
white of our best minds and most 
highly trained technicians? My 
own son is a surgeon. Does he op- 
erate on his people who need him 
so badly? No, he has been attract- 
ed by the high pay in the United 
States.” 

A new voice broke in, as bitter 
as were the others. “But your 
towns, your hundreds of thousands 
of mobile homes, streaming south. 
It is they that blanket our country 
and make them envious of your af- 
fluence and susceptible to your 
corruption. Why even this New 
Temple that sweeps your country. 
It is a religion of no religion. What 
do you think our simpler people 
are to believe when they see that 
such a religion is that of people 
who live like gods by their stan- 
dards?” 

Bat said, “Look. None of this is 



deliberate on our part. It began a 
long time ago and accelerated and 
there is no way to call a halt. We 
Americans have a tradition of be- 
ing on the move.” 

“But why to Mexico? Gringos 
go home I You’re destroying our 
country. We don’t want you!” 

Bat said stubbornly, “Your offi- 
cials gave us permission to enter.” 
“Yes, our officials! Your dollars 
corrupt everything. Our officials 
cannot see beyond the immediate 
millions that accrue to them 
through the money you spend.” 
“We’re only passing through,” 
Bat said. “We’ll only be in Mexico 
for a short time. We’re heading all 
the way down the Pan American 
Highway to South America.” 

The voice of the one from Gua- 
temala broke in heatedly. “Yes, 
and in our small country your pres- 
ence is even more objectionable. 
We of the more progressive classes 
are up in arms. I have come all 
this way to join the forces of Don 
Caesar ...” 

“Shuush,” somebody muttered. 

“ . and to prevent you fuom 
getting any further. Some of your 
towns are already swarming over 
nations as far south as Chile and 
the Argentine. Why you have not 
already been met with arms, I can- 
not say.” 

B at said impatiently, “Why, 
pick on New Woodstock? 
I’ve never heard of anything Kke

this before. You haven’t attempted 
to turn back other towns.” 

The older man’s voice said, 
“Quite deliberately, Mr. Hardin. 
Obviously, what we do is illegal by 
Mexican law. However, we are ded- 
icated and determined men. You 
will be an example. The fact that 
you are a mobile art colony, with 
all the connotations that brings to 
the average person’s mind, will 
make the example stronger. Were 
we to attempt to stop a city or 
town composed almost entirely of 
elderly retirees, it would be more 
difficult for us to gain sympathy 
both in your country and ours. But 
an art colony has a connotation of 
Bohemian life, immoral artists, 
high flown parties, much drinking 
of alcohol and smoking of mari- 
juana.” 

Bat said bitterly, “You’d be sur- 
prised how hard working and staid 
most real artists are.” 

“That is beside the point. It will 
be what people think, not the re- 
ality. Those that support us will 
draw a vivid picture of the deprav- 
ity of New Woodstock, Mr. Hard- 
in, and how God-fearing, country- 
loving Mexicans turned you back 
in indignation.” 

“And if we don’t turn back?” 
“We are dedicated and deter- 
mined men, Mr. Hardin.” 

“It isn’t up to me,” Bat said 
flatly. “New Woodstock is operated 
democratically to the extent we 
have government at all. It’ll have 



to be brought before the executive 
committee.” 

“Very well,” the old man said. 
“Jose, return him to his car.” 

Jose, evidently the original cap- 
tor, spoke rapidly in Spanish for 
a moment, then took Bat by the arm 
“Let’s go, Gringo,” he said. 

Bat came to his feet and suffered 
the other to lead him back the way 
they had come earlier. They re- 
traced the route in the same elder- 
ly steamer, and the blindfold was 
not removed until they reached the 
spot where Bat’s car had been left. 
They kept him carefully cov- 
ered. 

Jose looked into the interior of 
the car thoughtfully. He reached 
out with the barrel of the revolver 
he carried — it was an old style, 
possibly World War Two vintage, 
six-shooter — and smashed the 
screen of the vehicle’s phone. 

“Hey, that was a dirty trick,” 
Bat protested. 

Jose said apologetically, “Sorry. 
We’d rather you not be able to 
communicate with the police im- 
mediately.” 

“I’ll do just that when I get back 
to Linares.” 

“That will give us time enough.” 

“How about my gun?” 

“I’ll keep your gun, Senor Hard- 
in. I’d hate to have you using it on 
me, later.” 

Bat climbed into the car, started 
it up and made a wide turn, head- 
ing back for the site where New

Woodstock had settled for the 
night previous. 

He swore under his breath. It 
was going to be a hassle to get an- 
other pocket phone here in Mexi- 
co. He’d probably have to wait un- 
til he got to Mexico City and the 
American Consulate. These days, 
the unique device combined not 
only a portable TV phone, but your 
identity number which embraced 
your credit account, your voter’s 
registration, your military number, 
what amounted to your post office 
box, your income tax registration, 
and all else in the way of identity, 
including passport. 

Well, it couldn’t be helped. 

^Tew Woodstock was beginning 
* to get itself together prepara- 
tory to leaving, when Bat arrived. 
However, it would undoubtedly 
take a couple of hours or so more 
before it was really ready to roll. 
Instead of going to see Dean Ar- 
manruder immediately, he returned 
to his home with a cup of coffee in 
mind. He wanted to think about it 
a little before confronting the ex- 
ecutive committee’s questions. Ob- 
viously, they would depend largely 
on his opinions and Bat Hardin 
wasn’t quite sure what they were. 

He entered his mobile home and 
stared at the table. There on it was 
his pocket phone cum credit card. 

He took it up, still staring dis- 
belief. So far as he could see, there 
was nothing wrong with it. 



Bat left his home and looked up 
and down. Sam Prager’s mobile 
home and electronic repair shop 
was parked next to him on one side 
but nobody seemed to be about his 
place. Probably still in bed. The 
Pragers were inclined to read late 
into the night and arise at a late 
hour. 

Ferd Zogbaum’s camper was on 
the other side but there was no 
sign of Ferd. Bat strode over in 
that direction, and ran into his 
comrade in arms of the night be- 
fore on the far side of the camper. 
He was evidently deep in a heated 
discussion with Jeff Smith, a dis- 
cussion that was already just short 
of physical combat it seemed. 

“All right,” Smith snapped. “You 
asked for it!” He began to fall into 
a fighter’s stance. 

Bat began, “Okay, okay, you 
two. Break it up, you’re not a cou- 
ple of kids.” 

Jeff Smith turned on him, glow- 
ering. “Shut up, nigger t” 

V 

B at stared at Jeff Smith for a 
moment, then threw back his 
head and laughed. 

“It’s been a long time since I’ve 
heard that word,” he said. “You 
must be the last of the old time 
southerners. As a matter* of fact, 
my maternal grandmother was a 
Negress, but I doubt if even she 
was full-blooded.” 



40 



IF 




“Any nigger blood at all makes 
you one!” 

/Bat grinned at him. “So I under- 
stand was the law in some of the 
southern states in the old days. I 
wonder just what percentage of you 
southerners have African blood in 
you. For two centuries and more 
you had your black slaves. For all 
that time your men forced them- 
selves on the more attractive girls. 
There was a custom in .such towns 
as New Orleans of young aristo- 
crats setting up an apartment there 
in the French Quarter and keeping 
a quadroon or octaroon mistress. 
You know what the children of an 
octaroon look like, Smith? They 
look white and they move to an- 
other town and pass as white. Did 
you labor under the illusion that 
the famed Creole beauties of Lou- 
isiana were solely of French de- 
scent?” 

Smith began some obscenity, but 
Bat was suddenly fed up with the 
argument and with himself for 
bothering to get into it. He turned 
to Ferd and said, “Could I talk to 
you a minute? It’s important.” 

“Sure, why not,” Ferd Zogbaum 
said, ignoring Jeff Smith. He took 
Bat’s arm and headed around the 
camper, leaving behind the smaller 
man to glare after them. 

Bat said, when they were out of 
earshot, “What was all that?” 

Ferd shrugged it off. “Evidently, 
Jeff has delusions of being a great 
lover, or something. He’s got a 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



thing for Diana, you well know.” 
“Well, I don’t blame him. She’s 
a darn nice girl.” 

“Sure. But unfortunately for 
Jeff, she doesn’t have a thing for 
him. What’d you want to see me 
about?” 

“Did you see anybody go into 
my home this morning while I was 
gone?” 

“I didn’t even know you were 
gone, but no. Something stolen, or 
something? We don’t have much in 
the way of petty thievery around 
New Woodstock. I’d hate to see it 
happening.” 

“No. Not that. As a matter of 
fact, the other way. Somebody put 
something back.” 

Ferd looked at him and Bat 
made a quick rundown of the 
morning’s happenings, including 
the return of the pocket phone. 
Ferd hissed a whistle. 

Bat said, “As a matter of fact, 
it was damned decent of them to 
return it. They didn’t have to and 
there must have been some risk in- 
volved. These vigilanties aren’t 
really bad people and in a way I 
can see their point.” 

“Sure. Great,” Ferd said. “But 
that’s not going to do you much 
good when they start sniping away 
at us from the top of some hill as 
we go driving by.” 

Bat said, “Well, keep it under 
your hat for the time being. I’ll 
see what Dean Armanruder has to 
say.” 

41 




T>at Hardin stood before the 
^ identity screen of the Arman- 
ruder home and activated it. 

Nadine Paskov’s voice said im- 
patiently, 4 ‘You again? I thought 
you were driving up the road to 
check it.” 

Bat said patiently, “Pm back. 
I'd like to see Mr. Armanruder.” 

“He’s having his breakfast.” 

“It’s of the greatest importance, 
Miss Paskov.” 

“Just a minute.” 

Within that time the door open- 
ed and Bat stepped through and 
started down the corridor to the 
dining room. 

“Good morning, Hardin,” the re- 
tired magnate said, looking up from 
toast and coffee, “Coffee? Sit 
down.” 

Nadine Paskov wasn’t present 
but a dirty cup and plate indicated 
where she had taken her own break- 
fast. The Armanruder establish- 
ment was one of the few in New 
Woodstock that didn’t utilize dis- 
posable plates and utensils; but 
then, it was also the only home that 
had servants to clean up. 

Bat accepted the coffee and 
launched into his story. By the 
time he had finished, Dean Arman- 
ruder was swearing. 

He banged down his cup, came 
to his feet and said, “Come with 
me.” He led the way to his office. 

He sat down at his desk and ac- 
tivated the TV phone screen. “The 
police station in Linares,” he said. 



A Mexican face faded into view. 
Armanruder snapped, “D© 
you speak English?” 

The other said evenly, “For all 
practical purposes, all educated 
Mexicans speak English. May I ask 
who you are and what you wish?” 
“I am Dean Armanruder, senior 
member of the executive commit- 
tee of the mobile town of New 
Woodstock.” 

“ And I am Miguel Avila DeLeon, 
captain of police of the city of Lin- 
ares,” the other nodded. “What can 
I do for you, Senor?” 

The captain of Mexican police 
listened to the account with a 
frown of disbelief but said courte- 
ously, “Who were these men?” 

Bat came over and stood next to 
Armanruder. “I wouldn’t know. I 
was blindfolded. However, one who 
was obviously an older man was 
called Don Caesar and the one who 
kidnapped me was called Jose.” 
“Both rather common names in 
Latin countries,” the captain said. 
“They turned you loose?” 

“Yes, ©f course, here I am.” 

The captain had a few other 
questions. Bat answered everything 
to the best of his ability but there 
seemed to be a strange something 
in the police chief’s manner. 

Finally, it came out. He said, 
“Senor Hardin, if I am not mis- 
taken you are the gentleman who, 
in company with another Norte- 
americano provoked a drunken 
brawl ...” 



42 



IF 




“We weren’t at all drunk!” 
Captain DeLeon went on, “Er, 
in one of the cantinas here in Lin- 
ares, severely battering several of 
the citizens. My men took mea- 
sures to see that none of our vic- 
tims carried the matter further, but 
it would seem that some of them, 
Working behind our backs, took 
their revenge by playing a bit of a 
prank on you.” 

Bat said flatly, “The men who 
kidnapped me had no relationship 
to those in the bar. My kidnappers 
were educated men who spoke ex- 
cellent English. Those in the bar 
were town bums.” 

“I am sure you are mistaken, 
Senor Hardin. However, I will look 
into the matter.” 

Armanruder said harshly, “What 
are you going to do about it?” 

The captain shrugged a most 
Latin shrug and pursed his lips in 
regret. “I doubt if there is anything 
I can do about it, but, as I say, I 
shall investigate. Have you decided 
to turn back?” 

“No we haven’t!” Armanruder 
snapped, flicking off the set. 

TTe sat and glared in Bat’s dL 
^ -■* rection but not at him. 

Bat said, “The captain’s voice. 
I’ve heard it before, or, at least, I 
think I have. It was one of the 
voices when I was blindfolded.” 
“Are you sure!” 

“No, not sure, but I think it 
was.” 



Dean Armanruder steamed 
for a moment, then flicked on the 
set again. “John Fielding, Presi- 
dent of United Mobile Cities As- 
sociation of America, Greater Den- 
ver, Colorado.” 

When the face faded in, it was 
an impatient face. “Fielding here. 
I must say, this is an untoward 
hour. I won’t be in my office until 
nine.” 

Armanruder said, just as snap- 
pishly, “And this is an untoward 
situation.” He gave Bat’s story to 
the association head in detail. 

The other thought about it, un- 
happily. He took a deep breath fin- 
ally and said, “This is the worst 
yet.” 

“You mean there have been oth- 
er examples?” 

“Mr. Armanruder, do you know 
how many mobile cities, towns and 
villages crossed the border yester- 
day? Twenty-two, including New 
Woodstock. The largest was a city 
of more than fifty thousand occu- 
pants. Of course, this is the high 
season. Most of the mobile towns 
will remain in Mexico for only a 
few weeks, or months but some 
plan to remain indefinitely. The 
number increases each year. 
Wouldn’t you expect a certain 
amount of friction?” 

“Friction isn’t quite the way to 
put it. These men were heavily 
armed. They threatened Mr. Hard- 
in’s life.” 

John Fielding nodded. “I sus-

pect that before we’re through it 
will continue to get worse.” 

Dean Armanruder said, “What 
are you going to do?” 

“About Mr. Hardin’s adventure? 
What can we do? We’ll protest to 
the Mexican tourism authorities 
but, actually, you have very little 
in the way of evidence to present 
and evidently aren’t getting much 
in the way of support from the lo- 
cal police in acquiring more. Frank- 
ly, I’m inclined to think it a bluff. 
A small number of malcontents who 
wished to throw a scare into you. 
The moment one of them actually 
fired a shot, the Mexican police 
would be on them like a flash.” 

“I hope you’re right,” Bat mut- 
tered. 

Dean Armanruder made the stan- 
dard goodbyes and flicked the set 
off. Then he flicked it on again and 
said, “New Woodstock, Mr. Blake, 
Mr. Stryn, Doctor Barnes, Mr; Ter- 
williger, Mr. Prager.” 

X T7hen the executive committee 
* * had all assembled, Dean Ar- 
manruder had them seated in the 
salon. Jim Blake, the town’s most 
successful artist, financially speak- 
ing; Dag Stryn, also an artist and 
the guru of the town’s New Temple 
movement; Doctor Barnes; Phil 
Terwilliger, who represented the re- 
tired element in New Woodstock; 
and Sam Prager, who more or less 
represented the mechanics and oth- 
er workers in town. 



Dean Armanruder told the story 
himself, rather than Bat, but when 
it was over the questions were 
fired at the town’s patrolman. 

Sam Prager finally asked, “How 
many were there, Bat” 

“I’m not sure. I saw only four. 
I heard the voices of at least three 
others. There might have been 
twenty of them, for all I know. Or 
more.” 

Old man Terwilliger said, his 
voice on the fearful side, “I think 
we ought to go back.” 

“Certainly not,” Jim Blake said 
heatedly. “What are we, a bunch of 
sissies? We’ll call on the police.” 
“We already did,” Bat said. 
“They didn’t answer.” 

Blake said, “We’ll call in the 
American authorities, then. We’re 
all American citizens.” 

“I’m not,” Sam Prager said. “I’m 
a Canadian, but the thing is we’re 
in Mexico and under the jurisdic- 
tion of the Mexicans even if this 
is a predominantly American mo- 
bile town.” 

“We can issue a complaint to the 
American Consulate in Mexico 
City.” 

“If we get to Mexico City,” Bat 
said lowly. 

The elderly Phil Terwilliger said, 
“I vote to turn back, before it’s 
too late. I’m retired and have only 
a few years of life left to me. I have 
no intention of having the period 
shortened by desperate men shoot- 
ing at me.”

“IH vote to go back too,” Dag 
Stryn said. “I’D go on if the rest 
of you so decide but these people 
don’t want us.” 

“A very small number, perhaps, 
don’t want us; but for that matter 
some Americans don’t like the mo- 
bile towns and cities. We can’t 
please everyone,” Dean Arman- 
ruder said. “I vote to go on.” 

“I vote to go on,” Jim Blake 
said loudly. 

“So do I,” Sam Prager said. 

Doctor Barnes said, “Until we 
have evidence that they are really 
as determined as they say, I also 
vote to go on.” 

“The vote is four to two,” Dean 
Armanruder said. “We will pro- 
ceed. I suggest that the whole mat- 
ter be kept to us here; there is no 
use alarming the possibly more 
timid elements in New Wood- 
stock.” 

“Wait a minute,” Bat said. “This 
isn’t a matter for the executive 
committee to decide alone. You 
can’t expose everyone to this pos- 
sible danger without their even 
knowing about it. This is a matter 
of convening the assembly. If we 
vote on such matters as whether or 
not to stop for lunch, we certainly 
should vote on something as im- 
portant as this.” 

Dean Armanruder looked at him. 
“Your opinion is not needed, Hard- 
in. As town police officer you have 
a voice but not a vote in this ex- 
ecutive committee. 



“Bat’s right,” Sam ftager said. 
“It isn’t up to us to decide. “We’D 
have to call the assembly.” 

Doc Barnes nodded. “Obvioesfy. 
I’m afraid it’s going to mean a 
splitting up of the town. But we 
can’t take innocent people into pos- 
sible gunfire or other danger with- 
out giving them the opportunity of 
debating and voting on it.* 

TTThile Nadine Paskov and Dean 
* * Armanruder were going 
through the routine of summoning 
the assembly of all residents of 
New Woodstock over the age of 
eighteen, Bat Hardin went over to 
Sam Prager’s home cum repair shop 
and knocked at the door. Edith 
Prager opened it. She was an in- 
tense woman who impressed Bat 
Hardin as having a culture com- 
plex beyond that usually associated 
with even inhabitants of an art col- 
ony. He liked Sam Prager but in- 
variably felt uncomfortable in the 
presence of his wife. She wrote poe- 
try, Doc Barnes had said. 

“Hello, Mr. Hardin,” she said, 
standing in the door without in- 
viting him in. 

“Good morning,” he said. “Is 
Sam back from the meeting yet?” 

“No, he isn’t. What’s this atxmt 
an assembly?” 

“That’s right It’s being organ- 
ized right now. When Sam comes, 
will you let him know that the 
spreen on my car phone is broken? 
I think it’s just the screen.* 



THE TOWNS MUST ROLL

She said* sharply, “It’ll take a 
whole unit, possibly. Who’s to 
pay?” 

Bat said, “It’s my own car, Mrs. 
Prager, but it was damaged while on 
duty* for the town. I assume the 
cost of parts will come out of town 
finances, but I’ll take the bill im- 
mediately and charge it to the 
town later on. Tell Sam I’d appre- 
ciate having him put a high prior- 
ity on this. A police car simply 
can’t operate without a TV phone.” 

“I’ll tell him,” she said and 
closed the door. 

She seemed a bit abrupt. Bat re- 
membered Jeff Smith and wondered 
if there were others in New Wood- 
stock who, inwardly at least, ob- 
jected to him because of his racial 
heritage. 

It had been quite a time since 
he had even thought about the sub- 
ject. Particularly in a town such as 
New Woodstock, you didn’t expect 
to nm into characters who bothered 
with such nonsense as race, color 
or religious beliefs. He wondered 
vaguely if there were any Jews in 
New Woodstock; he had never 
thought of that before, either. Was 
Prager a Jewish name, or Zogbaum? 

The hell with it. He was impa- 
tient of the subject in this day and 
age. 

T Te re-entered his mobile house 
and took up a folding chair 
and, carrying it, went back to the 
center of the site. 



Others were already setting up 
their own chairs in a large horse- 
shoe-like semi-circle. 

It came to him that this was a 
present day equivalent of the old 
Town Meeting of New England or, 
possibly, something like the gov- 
erning of the Swiss Confederation 
of cantons. Working democracy in 
which every adult had his say be- 
cause the governing unit was small 
enough so that power and respon- 
sibility didn’t have to be delegated. 

When all except a few straggling 
latecomers had found places, Dean 
Armanruder opened the meeting. 

He came immediately to the 
point. “Mr. Hardin has requested 
a convening of the assembly on the 
grounds that the community has 
been threatened with physical dan- 
ger and must decide whether or not 
to continue this move to South 
America. Mr. Hardin.” 

When Bat had finished, stunned 
silence met his words for the nonce. 

Dean Armanruder cleared his 
throat. “The question before us is 
whether to proceed, or whether to 
return to the United States.” 

For a long moment, no one re- 
quested permission to speak. 

Finally: “The chair recognizes 
Mr. Jeff Smith.” 

Smith stood next to his folding 
seat and looked about him deliber- 
ately. “I think the first thing to 
consider is whether this whole story 
isn’t a complete lie?”

J ason leaned both hands on the 
thin euramite handrail. He 
could feel the intense straining of 
the gravity shell vibrate up his 
arms and into his head. It was a 
familiar feeling and it was a famil- 
iar position, standing in front of 
the large, thick, crystal viewing 
window, with the hazy lime-green 
glowing of the gravity shell tinting 
the view. He liked being captain 
of a Heavy Probe, and he liked 
standing there, staring out at the 
perfectly symmetrical surface of 
Black Dwarf 2146. There was no 
doubt about it; Jason liked his 
work.

the rail with the palms of his 
hands. 

From across the small raft-like 
-cabin there came a faintly mechan- 
ical reply. “Indicate the nature 
and location of your pain. I will 
prescribe treatment.” 

Jason turned slowly and faced 
the dozen or so blinking lights of 
the computer. His face looked 
pained. He started to scream, "It’s

self. “Computer, disregard state- 
ment.” 

“Disregarded.” 

For the last six months he^d put 
up with all of the smart-alec cracks

from the new computer, and he 
was finally beginning to get used 
to them. He turned away, shaking 
his bead, and stared out at the sym- 
metrically perfect carbon ash-heap 
that reached out into the dim dis- 
tance. It always made him feel 
strange inside to think he was on 
the surface of a star — a dead star. 
It also made him feel strange when 
he thought about a millisecond 
failure of the gravity shell. The re- 
sult would be to spread him as a 
film one atom thick over the en- 
tire surface of the star. But really 
there wasn’t anything to worry 
about. The shells just didn’t fail; 
and besides, that was all part of 
the thrill of the work. Then, as he 
looked out the viewing window, he 
saw another part of his job. 

Stars. The black surface of the 
Dwarf set off their faint radiance 
and made them look as if he could 
reach up and grab a handful. God, 
he thought, there must be a billion 
of them within a dozen parsecs. 
And then, with a sigh, he turned 
to the matters at hand. “Compu- 
ter, activate sensors and begin re- 
cording data.” As an afterthought, 
he added, “Audio readout this 
time.” 

“Activating,” the machine said, 
and then silently went to work. 

Jason rather liked this new mod- 
el computer, despite the fact that 
it sounded off at times with im- 
pudent cracks. He also rather liked 
not having to sweat over a control

the other stuff that went with man-

all, he liked not having to put up 
with all the damned clattering

The computer was ready. “Data

hold!” There was a brief silence 
filled with blinking lights, and fol- 
lowed by a now puzzled mechani- 
cal voice. “Sixty-eight degrees, four 
minutes west — forty-five degrees, 
three minutes south: protrusion on 
surface.” 

Jason muttered something about 
the fail-proof new computers and 
went over to the machine and 
pushed several red buttons. Lights 
flickered in the silence, then noth- 
ing. “What the hell?” he said 
aloud, “There’s nothing wrong with 
it!” It had all checked out. He was 
suddenly worried. “Computer, re- 
calibrate.” 

"1 TThile the machine worked on in 
’ * silence, Jason ran over to the 
viewing window, wondering if it 
was the Gelcons. Brother, that was 
just what he needed — a diplo- 
matic incident on his record. Well, 
it wasn’t his fault. How the hell 
was he supposed to know the Dwarf 
belonged to somebody else? You 
don’t just hang a flag out on a 
Black Dwarf. 

“Fact is affirmative,” boomed 
the computer. 

It just had to be something else. 
Hoping some freak in the laws of 
physics could save him, he turned 
and asked, “What’s surface gravi- 
ty?” 

“11,349 gravities.” 

That was it. There wasn’t any- 
thing natural which could stand 
all that force. It had to be the Gel- 



cons. He wondered if he’d blunder- 
ed onto a whole military outpost 
on some sort of anti-grav pads. 
“Can you specify size and type of 
protrusion?” 

“Two objects. One: metallic — 
two point eight-nine kilometers ver- 
tical, three-four millimeters at base 
tapering to a point. Two: ceramic 
crystal structure — spherical — 
two hundred meter diameter.” 

Next came the big question. “Is 
there any . Stop. Can you detect 
any life forms in the area?” 

Silence. Then the machine an- 
swered, “Negative. Suggest a close 
examination of area.” 

Jason was so relieved to learn 
there was nobody there that the 
Probe was already speeding across 
the Dwarf toward the strange pair 
of objects, before he realized he’d 
given the command. He suddenly 
wondered if he’d better not let 
somebody else handle this whole 
thing, and just get out of there. 
But then he began thinking about 
the needle-like spire pointing two 
miles straight into space, and about 
the big sphere. It puzzled him. 
Should he go? Here he had a 
chance to discover something, 
something possibly valuable. And 
after all, wasn’t that why he was 
there? That was it, and he was go- 
ing. Just then he felt a twinge in 
his stomach and he tried to figure 
out if it was from fear or excite- 
ment. 

Minutes wore on, miles fled be-

hind the speeding Probe, and Jason 
grew nervous. “Computer, any ad- 
ditional information?” 

“Negative,” it said simply. 

“How long till we reach the ob- 
jective?” 

“Five minutes, forty-three . sec- 
onds.” 

That was going to be one long 
five minutes. He sat down and 
tapped an erratic beat near the 
sharp edge of the desk top with 
his fingers. The unidentified twinge 
in his stomach wrenched. He stood 
up and walked over to the hand- 
rail. Stars, ash-heap and galaxy 
were all tinted with the lime-green 
glowing of the gravity shell. Some- 
where out. there ahead was some- 
thing that just couldn’t exist; and 
yet it was there — withstanding 
eleven thousand plus gravities. He 
took a deep breath. The uneasy 
rasp from it seemed to reverberate 
through the silent cabin, and he 
half wished the computer would 
come up with some stupid wise- 
crack. Suddenly the computer voice 
resounded in his ears. “Object vis- 
able on horizon,” it said, “Contact 
in three minutes.” 

Jason strained his eyes and fran- 
tically searched, but he couldn’t 
see anything. The Probe began its 
slow braking process, as he searched 
back and forth across the horizon. 
Nothing, nothing but . Wait! 
Yes, there it was. Ever so faint, a 
tiny glint of metal. He watched as 
it grew in size and brightness. It 



was an incredible thing. With nor- 
mal gravity, a two-mile spire was 
a difficult engineering feat, but 
here on a Black Dwarf it was just 
impossible. Then, the top of that 
ceramic sphere began to rise slowly 
above the horizon. It was white, 
and from the distance it looked 
smooth. “Computer,” he asked, 
“what are they?” 

“Unknown,” was the answer. 

“Well, how long to contact?” 

“Contact in ... ” But the com- 
puter never finished. As Jason 
watched, it seemed as if a thou- 
sand electrical storms had been un- 
leashed from the sphere. Hundreds 
of spider-tentacles of lightening en- 
ergy ripped across the surface of 
the star, toward the Probe. They 
danced madly on the hull, and in- 
side they sparked through every- 
thing, sucking out the energy. Then 
instantly they were gone, retreated 
back to the Sphere. 

The cabin was dark and silent. 
Jason lay by the handrail on the 
floor in a heap, unconscious. 

TTThen he awoke, his throat felt 
** like a shovel full of dried des- 
ert mud. It cracked as he breathed. 
His eyes were burning 'fiercely and 
beads of sweat poured from his 
body. The first blurry thing he 
saw was the viewing window. Its 
lime-green glowing was gone. The 
gravity shell was gone! He must 
be dead! Slowly he raised up on 
one side, blinked and rubbed his 



50 



IF 




eyes, unbelieving. As he stood up, 
he was hit by a blast of seething 
hot air. He gasped for breath. The 
cabin was hot, unbearably hot. His 
head swam. “Computer,” he 
choked, “temperature control.” 
There was no response. He swung 
around to find the computer’s 
blinking lights were out. The com- 
puter was deadl Dazed, he stag- 
gered across the deck to the ma- 
chine and stabbed blindly at sev- 
eral swaying red buttons. His arms 
ached. His head began to throb, 
and then the whole cabin spun 
around and went black. 

Jason was shivering when he re- 
gained consciousness. The metal 
deck felt cold against his face. He 
suddenly tasted blood in his mouth 
and it scared him. A shock of adren- 
alin flushed through his body and 
he doubled up in a convulsion. His 
fingers were numb and his eyes 
ached from the cold. Everything 
was blurry. He sat up and touched 
his aching forehead. There was a 
deep gash there and it was bleed- 
ing. He could feel the warmth of 
the blood as it ran down his cheek. 
Then he remembered — the view- 
ing window! He looked. It was 
black. As he looked around, he 
couldn’t believe it. Everything was 
still there, and he was alive! Even 
the computer was operating again, 
and yet the gravity shell was gone! 
His teeth began to chatter as he 
asked, “Computer. Why aren’t we 
dead?” 



“There is a gravity neutraliza- 
tion field within a five kilometer 
radius of the sphere. Present grav- 
ity: sub-normal.” 

Jason felt helpless. His head was 
blurry, he couldn’t think straight 
and he was freezing. “Computer, 
activate temperature control.” 
“Impossible.” 

“But why? What’s going on?” 
“We triggered a reaction field. 
Variety: unknown. It has extracted 
all the Nu-mesons from the reactor 
elements. No main power Auxili- 
ary batteries only.” 

“Then tap some of the battery 
power!” 

Almost immediately the cabin 
began to warm. Jason’s teeth soon 
quit clacking together and he could 
think once again. Without the re- 
actors, there was no high-pulse 
communications, and the nearest 
star-base was over 26 parsecs away. 
That also put the engines out of 
work, and along with them the 
gravity shell. It was all fantastic! 
There was something here on a 
Black Dwarf canceling the star’s 
crushing gravity. He was caught up 
in something he couldn’t under- 
stand and coldn’t help. The deck 
passed awkwardly beneath his feet 
as he went toward the viewing win- 
dow. Then suddenly, the Probe 
shot forward with a tremendous 
lurch; Jason was thrown to the 
deck. “Yee-ouch!” he yelled, as he 
crashed to the hard floor. 

“Vehicle is in motion,” affirmed 



ON THE DEAD STAR 



51 




the computer from across the room. 

He felt like cursing the machine, 
but thought better of it and rubbed 
his bruised knee instead. 

After crawling the rest of the 
way over to the viewing window, 
he pulled himself up to the hand- 
rail. God, it was a weird feeling to 
see the viewing window without the 
green glow of the shell. Outside, 
roughly four miles away, he could 
see the sphere and the spire. 

The computer announced, * “Ve- 
hicle approaching sphere at eight 
meters per second.” 

Quddenly in the distance, there 
^ was a brilliant flash of white 
light. It came from the spire. Great 
cloud-like pulses of energy were 
sweeping up from the base to the 
tip and then diffusing out into 
space. It looked like some gigantic 
Jacobi Ladder. 

There was more data. “Vehicle 
is increasing speed. Fourteen me- 
ters per second.” 

Well, if this kept up, he was cer- 
tainly going to get a closer look. It 
suddenly hit him. He was being 
pulled right into that mass of seeth- 
ing energy! “Computer, are we 
heading for the spire?” 

“Negative,” came the reply. 

That was a relief. At least he 
wasn’t going to be fried alive. As 
he looked out, he could see that 
the ship was heading safely be- 
tween the pair of objects. Now that 
he was safe, he grew curious again. 



“Computer, can you analyze the 
energy from the spire?” 

“Spire pulses are masses of neu- 
tron-proton groups, whose meson- 
meson interaction has been violent- 
ly upset, causing the emanation 
of approximately ten megawatts of 
giga-frequency electromagnetic en- 
ergy, in an omnidirectional pat- 
tern.” 

What it all meant was more than 
he could see. Obviously a radio 
transmitter of some sort, but why 
here on a Black Dwarf? Then the 
computer had more information. 
“Vehicle trajectory is curved. Will 
impact with sphere in two minutes, 
five seconds. Velocity increasing. 
Seventeen meters per second.” 

It couldn’t be! Jason spun 
around and glared out the viewing 
window. It was right! Already he 
could see they were turning, right 
toward the sphere. He was con- 
fused. He didn’t know just what to 
make of the last few minutes. Ev- 
erything had happened so fast All 
the power had been sucked out of 
his engines — he couldn’t alter his 
course, he couldn’t send for help, 
and in another two minutes he’d be 
dead — smashed like a tomato 
against the sphere. He stared 
numbly out the window. The Probe 
was plunging faster and faster to- 
ward it. Death was crashing in on 
Jason with all its vulgar fury, and 
yet he was immersed in silence. It 
was too much; he couldn’t stand 
it. 



52 



IF 




He whirled around. “Computer! 
Can’t we do anything?” 

“Negative,” was the cool reply. 
“How long?” he yelled. 

“Forty seconds.” 

He was totally helpless. Closer 
and closer, larger and larger grew 
the sphere. Twenty seconds away. 
He gripped thfc handrail harder. 
The sphere now filled the viewing 
window completely. In another ten 
seconds he’d be smashed to a pulp. 
Silence, weird and out of place. 
His knuckles were white. He 
braced himself. With a tremendous 
crunch, the Probe met the sphere. 
Instantly the small cabin was filled 
with great streaks of lightning and 
Jason was thrown against the op- 
posite wall. Uninjured, he shook 
his head and looked up. Half of 
the Probe was gone. The sphere 
was absorbing it, like a bit of food! 
Slowly the ceramic surface of the 
sphere was moving across the deck 
toward him. It was closing in on 
him. He pushed frantically against 
the deck with his feet to get away. 
No good! He was trapped against 
the wall. It was coming closer and 
closer, crackling as it came. He 
could see himself being crushed 
against the wall. 

What was that? There was a 
strange feeling in his foot. He look- 
ed down. The foot was gone — it 
was in the sphere. He tried to move 
it. Impossible! He pushed against 
the sphere with his other foot, but 
it too was immediately absorbed in- 



to the sphere, as into wet cement. 
Both of his legs were in up to his 
thighs. He couldn’t feel them at 
all! It was up to his waist, like so 
much sand pouring through a sieve. 

His stomach and lower ribs were 
disappearing. He was frantic. He 
reached with his hands to push 
himself away. No good! They too 
stuck tight. Slowly it moved up his 
chest. All he could move was his 
head. He was being suffocated! He 
tried to scream, but he couldn’t — 
he no longer had any lungs. 

J ason didn’t know how long 
he’d been unconscious, but 
he felt rested. He was inside the 
Probe, lying on the deck and there 
was a brilliant flow of light dif- 
fusing into the cabin through the 
viewing window. He slowly crawled 
over to it; shading his eyes from 
the glare, he peered out. The light 
seemed to be coming from every- 
where. He couldn’t see anything, 
except a fuzzy wall that flickered 
red and orange and looked like 
fire. Damn these Probes, he 
thought to himself; there was only 
one window. He leaned close to the 
crystal window and pressed his 
cheek against it to increase his 
viewing angle. No good, still noth- 
ing. He wondered where in hell he 
was. Well, there was only one way 
to find out. “Computer, give me 
the life support specs.” 
“Atmosphere: oxygen - nitrogen 
plus trace elements. Tempera- 



ON THE DEAD STAR 



53 




ture: normal. Radiation: slightly 
above normal.” 

Jason now knew it was safe to 
go outside, but he was hesitant. He 
decided he’d better dean himself 
up before he went out. That way 
he’d have a little time to organize 
his thinking. He went over to the 
medical locker and got out a medi- 
pad. And then, from the storage 
cabinets, he got a large steri-towel 
and deaned his face and hands and 
the wound. That felt better. He 
tore open the package and gently 
put the medi-pad on his forehead. 

“Yee-ouchl” he yelled. “Five 
thousand years of medirine and the 
damned things still burn.” Instant- 
ly he added in the same tone, “Shut- 
up, computer!” 

There was nothing else to wait 
for. He took a deep breath and 
then released the lever. The thick 
hatch popped open without any 
hiss of pressure equalizing. Jason 
carefully went to the opening and 
stuck his head out. He was inside 
a huge hemisphere about 200 me- 
ters across. The curved walls of the 
thing changed colors randomly in 
patches, now a deep red, now a 
bright orange. He realized he was 
inside the sphere. The reason he 
couldn’t see anything from inside 
the Probe was because the viewing 
window had been backed up next 
to the wall. But now he was facing 
right out into everything. The 
Probe was resting on a plane that 
split the sphere in half. Whatever 



was beneath it, he couldn’t tell, and 
what was above it, he couldn’t be- 
lieve. Three short steps below him 
was an open space covered with a 
dark green growth of some sort that 
looked like grass. A little way off, 
there was a narrow, orange path- 
way that led through what appear- 
ed to be a forest, but not like any 
forest he’d ever seen before. There 
were literally hundreds of weirdly 
twisted geometric shapes and cy- 
lindrical forms scattered randomly 
about, as far as he could see. The 
objects were made of some dear 
crystalline substance, but their in- 
sides were shot through with tiny 
particles of color that flashed and 
then faded back to normal brilli- 
ance, like the glistening of a dis- 
placed rainbow. All these objects 
in the weird light made an utterly 
fascinating sight. 

Jason stepped down and bent 
over to examine the grass. It felt 
cool like grass, but it was artificial. 
He knew it wasn’t real because, as 
he walked over to the pathway, it 
crunched beneath his shoes like 
the breaking of glass. As he stepped 
out onto the pathway, he. found it 
very smooth, but not at all slip- 
pery. He began to walk toward the 
forest of objects. About ten feet in 
front of him was one object nearly 
twice his height that looked some- 
thing like a pretzel, but was twisted 
and misshapen. As he approached, 
the insides of the thing began to 
flow with washes of color that 



54 



IF 




blended with each other but didn’t 
disturb the bursting particles of 
color. He was next to it now; he 
reached out and touched it. It was 
very smooth and a gentle warmth 
seemed to radiate from it. As Jason 
looked down toward the bottom of 
it, a voice — a smooth, masculine 
voice — flooded the hemisphere. 
“Do you like it?” the voice asked. 
“It’s my favorite.” 

J ason turned around, but there 
was no one there — nothing. 
And then he recalled that the voice 
had seemed to come from every- 
where. “Where are you?” asked 
Jason. 

“Beneath your feet, inside of 
you, all around you. I’m every- 
where.” 

Jason tried to focus on the walls, 
but couldn’t. A quick scan of the 
forest of geometric objects revealed 
nothing. All was motionless, except 
for the smooth changing of colors 
in the walls. “Who are you?” he 
asked. 

A short laugh rang out. “Don’t 
be frightened now, but let’s say 
I’m one of the Damned, returned 
from Hell to taunt and haunt.” It 
laughed again. “Does that frighten 
you?” 

A strange crawling thing seemed 
to march up and down Jason’s 
back. “Yes,” he choked. “Yes it 
does.” 

The tone became different now, 
concerned. “Oh, I’m sorry,” it said, 



“That’s no way to start a long 
friendship, is it?” 

A long friendship? What did it 
mean by that? What was going on? 
“Why did you bring me here?” he 
asked. 

“I did not bring you. You came 
of your own will, to stay with me.” 
Those words rang in his ears. 
“Stay with you?” 

“Yes, of course. I am a curious 
soul, a human sold. I want com- 
panionship. It’s really very simple. 
You will remain here with me.” 
That was all there was to it. “I’m 
your prisoner, then?” 

“Well, not exactly,” it said, not 
unkindly. “You may leave anytime 
you wish. Provided, of course, that 
you find a way of combating the 
gravity and the vacuum, once you 
leave. Not to mention getting out 
of this sealed sphere. But one never 
knows; does one?” 

“No, I guess not.” Jason 
couldn’t believe it. Here he was, 
standing and talking with some- 
thing he couldn’t see, something 
totally unknown to him, that was 
holding him prisoner. It was all ri- 
diculous. “Why are you doing 
this?” he asked. “Just what are you 
curious about? 

“That’s a good point to start on.” 
The voice suddenly had a direction. 
“Look, why don’t you follow the 
pathway over here? Then we’ll 
talk about it. Yes, yes indeed, we’ll 
talk.” 

The voice was gone. Jason could

55 




feel its absence. He conld also feel 
his own anger at ever leaving the 
floor of that bar on Beta-Tau-Four 
to join the service, mixing with an- 
ger at this thing, whatever it was, 
that was holding him here for some 
stupid reason. It had said there was 
no certainty about escapes. Well, 
that had sounded damned overcon- 
fident, as far as he could see. So 
this would be his point to start 
from. First, he needed information 
about this thing — what it looked 
like, why it was here, how much 
power it had? From there, he could 
plan on how to fight it and escape. 

The twisted objects held a weird 
sort of fascination for Jason as he 
hurried down the pathway, sur- 
rounded by them. The insides of 
them would wash with color as he 
approached; and when he had 
passed, the colors would fade and 
just the exploding pin points of col- 
or would remain. Then, all around, 
was that vexing wall of the sphere. 
When he looked up into it, there 
was no depth. It was like trying to 
see the distance of the stars. It all 
had a sort of bizzare unreality to 
it. Just then he rounded a bend, 
and there before him in a clearing 
was the thing. 

Tt sat head-high atop a pyramid 
-*■ of ebon cubes. It was a small 
sphere that glowed internally with a 
blue light. This was his captor. 

“Hell-o ! ” it said, gaily. “I see 
youVe come.” 



“Yoy gave me a big choice,” he 
replied' angrily. 

Its voice was suddenly loud irftb 
anger. “How would you like to be 
peeled and salted? Or I can roast 
you where you stand, if you Kke!” 
It paused and then went on, 
“Humph I Is it better to be well or 
medium rare . uh . Say, what is 
your name? I could seek it m your 
mind, but I find that peeping-tom 
practice very distasteful.” 

Jason was so scared he had dif- 
ficulty answering. “I . Pm . 
Jason,” he finally managed to blurt 
out. 

“Jason,” it said, savoring the 
name. “I like that. And it’s a start! 
Yes, it surely is.” The thing was 
no longer mad. 

Jason couldn’t fathom the 
change, but there was something 
else. What was it a start of? Care- 
fully, he asked, “Now that Pm 
here, what are we going to do?” 
“We talk, what else?” 

“Talk? Talk about what?” 
“About you, of course. I already 
know all about myself. I want to 
learn about you.” 

“About me? But why?” 

“Oh, dear. I can see that this is 
going to be more difficult than I 
had thought.” 

Jason was sure this was the end. 
He closed his eyes and there was a 
sudden crackling noise behind Mm 
that made him wince. He turned 
slowly to find a bench, a table, a 
pitcher full of liquid and a glass.

IF 




“Tell you what,” said the thing, 
“you sit down and refresh your- 
self, while I start the conversation. 
Is that all right with you?” 

“Yeah, yeah that’s all right,” he 
said. He sat down quickly on the 
hard bench. 

“Good I Well, let’s see — where 
to begin? Ah, yes. I’m a beacon, 
or rather I used to be one. I was 
called the Voice.” It seemed to 
think for a second, then continued. 
“Now, how I got here. The little 
blue sphere you see before you con- 
tains a soul, my soul. A bodyless 
soul, but one that volunteered for 
hazardous duty when in flesh.” It 
began to laugh, heartily. “Oh, myl 
It’s so good to tell someone about 
all this. You see, I didn’t volunteer 
— I was volunteered.” The thing 
continued its laughter. 

Jason wanted to keep it talking 
and happy. “What kind of hazard- 
ous duty?” 

It sobered. “Takes an explana- 
tion. My people were going to leave 
the galaxy to explore the universe. 
And so, to make a long story short, 
they needed a beacon to find their 
way back.” 

A couple of pieces fell into place. 
“The spire outside.” 

“Well, yes. There is the spire 
now, but that is really insufficient, 
since all its power will dwindle 
in 50 million years.” 

There was something that didn’t 
fit. “Sorta strange place for a bea- 
con — here on Black a Dwarf.” 



“Ah, but you see, a little over a 
billion years ago this was a raging 
G-4 star. It was then that I was 
really a beacon.” 

Now this might lead to some- 
thing. “You say you made a bea- 
con out of a star?” 

“Yes, and that was the — or 
rather my — hazardous duty.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Well, you see our scientists dis- 
covered how to turn the photo- 
sphere of a star into a tremendous 
radio transmitter. But there was 
one catch.” 

“Yeah, what?” 

“It had to be done from the in- 
side.” 

J ason, who had been sipping 
cautiously at the cool drink, 
choked and began to cough. “From 
the inside! You mean the inside of 
the star?” 

“Uh-huh. An inside job.” 

Jason choked again and forced a 
laugh. He then pressed on. “But 
the temperature is twenty-eight 
million degrees in the center of a 
G-4 star. Nothing but free sub- 
atomic particles.” 

“And hot as hell, too,” it said, 
describing the living conditions. 
“Yeah, but how?” 

“Through hazardous duty. Flesh 
can’t exist with all that radiation 
and the tremendous heat. Even 
with our most sophisticated pro- 
tection and cooling systems it 
wasn’t feasible.” 



ON THE DEAD STAR 



57 




“Why not? Do you know?” 

“Well, the beacon had to last for 
billions of years, and flesh just 
doesn’t. So my soul was transposed 
onto a bank of neural, superfluid 
poly-helium circuits. These would 
control our displacement device, 
which knocked all the Delta-mesons 
from the opposite field nuclei, 
which in turn set up . Well, you 
get the idea.” 

Jason was puzzled. “I think so,” 
he said, “But why use a human 
soul? Why not let a computer do 
it?” 

“You see, at the time we didn’t 
have any practical knowledge about 
the internal evolution of stars. Oh, 
we had theories, but there was too 
much at stake to take the chance. 
With a human soul inside, research 
could be undertaken to adjust for 
any unforseen changes, if any took 
place. And the star could continue 
functioning as a beacon.” 

There was a pause. Jason search- 
ed madly for conversation. “So, 
uh, you’ve been here for billions of 
years, eh?” 

“Six to be exact,” it said, hap- 
pily, “I transmitted for about five 
billion, and when the nuclear re- 
actions fell below IS million de- 
grees, I lost my transmission and 
controlling power and drifted to 
the surface. During the billion or 
so years the star took to cool, I de- 
veloped a way effectively to cut 
off the gravity. But my energy 
stores had all but dwindled to noth- 



ing when you came to help me.” 

That explained another difficul- 
ty Jason had met, and it made him 
angry. “You stole the Nu-mesons 
from my reactor, didn’t you?” He 
caught himself and waited for pun-, 
ishment. None came. 

Instead, the thing sounded hurt 
at the harsh accusation. “I didn’t 
steal them, I just wanted to bor- 
row them.” It sounded as if it was 
crying. 

Jason didn’t know what to ex- 
pect. He tried to sooth the crea- 
ture. “Well, can you put them 
back? I mean, make my reactors 
function again?” 

“Oh, yes. Yes of course, I can.” 
It sounded happy again. “But I 
have no intention of sending you 
away like that, now that you’ve 
come to me.” 

Another lull in the conversation. 
Come on boy, keep it going or 
you’ll end up fried alive! “Well, 
why don’t you go on with your 
story?” 

It was enthusiastic again. “AB 
right. Oh, by the way, I’m sorry 
about the temperature extremes af- 
ter I borrowed the mesons from 
your reactors. I didn’t know what 
your normal temperature was, so. I 
had to guess at it.” 

“Don’t mention it. It was only 
two of the seven rings,” he said, 
with a far-away smile. 

The voice laughed loudly, and 
an invisible hand slapped him on 
the back and knocked him off the 



58 



IF 




bench. “Yes, I can see well get 
along very well together. You have 
a marvelous sense of humor.” 
Jason frowned, brushed himself 
off and got back on the bench. 
“What, uh, did you do all this 
time?” 

“Billions of years with nothing 
to do. That was a problem at first, 
but slowly as my intelligence be- 
gan to increase along with my 
knowledge, I began to research and 
invent and discover things — ev- 
erything. You know, in six billion 
years you can unravel just about 
all the tangles of science and cre- 
ation. As you might have guessed, 
my latest fancy is art. This garden, 
or forest or whatever you wish to 
call it, is merely an extension of 
my own mind. Sort of like painting 
or sculpture, but without any phys- 
ical effort on my part. Just for fun, 
I think things into place. It's in- 
tensly interesting to me.” It sighed. 
“But it’s gdtten so dull. What I 
mean is, there’s nothing new. I’ve 
learned all there is to learn, I’ve 
done everything and I’m bored. 
The only thing left is people. That’s 
why you’re going to stay with me.” 
Jason sounded concerned. “But 
what do you want me to do?” 

“I want to share your experi- 
ences, your memories — I want you 
to tell me of them.” The thing 
sounded like a child with a new 
toy. “So as long as you’re here, you 
might as well start” 

Jason had no choice. All his life 



he’d never been much of a con- 
versationalist, but now he was go- 
ing to learn — and quickly. 

M any hours must have gone by 
before Jason finally asked, 
“Are you interested in continuing 
this now?” 

“Oh, yes, indeed I am,” I said 
brightly. Then it added, “Ah, but 
you’re tired, I can see that. You 
may return to your Probe and 
spend the night. Tomorrow we’ll 
make plans for a permanent place 
for you to sleep.” 

Jason got up. His legs ached and 
his seat hurt from sitting on that 
damned hard bench. He limped the 
first steps down the pathway, and 
then turned to look back at the 
sphere as it said, “Good-night, Ja- 
son. Sweet dreams.” 

“Yeah, right. Happy nightmares 
to you, too,” he choked back, 
hoarsely. 

The thing laughed again. 
“You’re just hilarious, Jason. I’ve 
made an excellent choice in you.” 
As he hobbled down the path- 
way, he didn’t think too much 
about the choice the thing had 
made, and he didn’t think it was 
one damned bit funny. 

The hatch was still open when 
Jason reached the Probe. He slow- 
ly entered, crossed the deck and 
plopped down in his bunk. He 
tried to think, but he ached too 
much. All he could think about 
was spending the rest of his life en- 



ON THE DEAD STAR 



69 




tertaining that stupid blue ball. 

“Damnit!” he yelled, as he slam- 
med his fist into the pillow. “Why 
me? Of all the jerks in the galaxy, 
why do I have to be the one!” 

From across the cabin, lights 
blinked and the familiar computer 
voice said, “One jerk is just as good 
as another.” 

That was the last straw! “Shut- 
up! You damned clanking piece of 
junk!” Brother! That was just 
what he needed. It was then, in his 
anger, that suddenly the solution 
came to him. 

Hours later, the new makeshift 
control panel was set in front of 
the viewing window. Through it, he 
watched the darkness and distance 



at last swallow Dwarf 2146. Inside 
the cabin it was dark too, except for 
the new control panel. 

As Jason stared from the view- 
ing window, he wondered if he 
would start to miss that smart- 
aleck computer. 

Then he smiled. Nope, he wasn’t 
going to miss it one bit. And he 
was sure that both it and the voice 
would be very happy back on the 
star, spending endless hours enter- 
taining each other. And best of all, 
he was free again. There was no 
doubt about it. If he had to name 
one man in the service who really 
liked his work, the name was Jason.

IF • Short Story 



AUTOHUMAN 14 

by bruce McAllister 



Everyone agreed that autohumans 
alt were very well adjusted . 



'T'he dashboard fights were red, 
yellow and white teeth, bared 
suddenly in a smile when the radio 
crackled and headquarters an- 
nounced: “Autohuman 14, S-80-81! 
Armed robbery seventh sector. Bi- 
turb, thought to be Fordam model 
Light Year , metallic green, license 
FJF-7981. Two male youths carry- 
ing hand-rasers, proceeding west on 
Freeline 28, dangerous.” 

Lt. Grabe Massel smiled back at 
the dashboard. As headquarters 
continued with a repeat of its in- 
formation and implicit orders, he 
deactivated two rockets, decelerated 
rapidly, slipped his police vehicle 
down an off-ramp and crossed the 
underpassing street with his multi- 
pitch siren screaming and his ana- 



logous-colored warning lights syn- 
copated. Stopping finally on the 
adjacent on-ramp, MassePs car 
hovered on puffing air-foils, hidden 
under the edge of Freeline 2S, as 
he waited for the passing blur of 
the fleeing suspects in their metal- 
lic green Fordamerican Motors 
Light Year . 

All freeways except the distant 
Urban Crux 1 were empty this time 
of night; the first car that passed 
was the right one, and instantly 
Massel activated the prime motor 
and its five rockets. 

First the main engine went tarun, 
tarun, tarun as Massel gunned it. 
Then opal rear-rocket fires seared 
the pavement, and Masel was 
thrown back against the seat as his 



61 




auto lanced up the on-ramp, wob- 
bled in the air as he overshot the 
norm hover-level, and finally fell 
back to a stable airfoil level on the 
freeway, about a mile behind the 
Light Year but gaining rapidly. 

The Light Year was fast, with 
its twin turbines, but Massel’s auto 
had too many finely developed 
speed and suspension extras for 
the race to be fair. In addition, 
Massel was one of the twenty best 
coordinated drivers in the force. 
And, of course, there were the high- 
range stunners that could fan the 
entire interior of a fleeing auto, if 
speed failed to give Massel enough 
advantage. MasseFs car was a good 
one, one to be proud of, as he knew 
each time he heard its confident 
starting voice. 

Still, Massel wondered why auto 
companies built civilian vehicles for 
that speed. Perhaps in some juven- 
ile hope — or unconscious wish — 
that there would be freeway auto 
competitions with police or other 
members of the young public? 
Massel did not know. He didn’t 
care at this moment; he was mov- 
ing wonderfully fast now, the 
Light Year growing larger in his 
eyes. 

Excited but confident, with noth- 
ing on his mind except an easy 
chase, Massel happened to look 
down at the floor. All the webs of 
colored wires there caught his eye, 
and for a second his mind allowed 
him to see the truth of his con- 



dition. Then his mind blurred, as 
his mental block worked for the 
millionth-odd time, translating Mas- 
sePs reality into acceptable terms 
for him — terms of youth and of 
legs, in the poetry of another man 
who had lived an idyllic youth of 
legs. Massel saw himself, in a time 
and place he had never lived in, but 
with legs he had once known, and 
the vision had its parallels — 

A s always, Massel was running 
** after someone, along a won- 
derful path, a path free of dust but 
still not at all rough to his bare 
feet. The feeling of Mercurial wings 
on his feet and head made the 
eternal chase pleasant. Massel was 
a fleet-footed boy. 

To run, sang his mind. To run, 
to run, to run. 

In front of him ran a slower, 
weaker boy, clad in an airy shirt 
and shorts just slightly different 
from MassePs own. The path 
twisted and curved, and Massel 
flew past the moist moss on tree 
trunks and the yellow lichens of 
granite boulders. His precious feet 
padded against the earth rhythmi- 
cally, and the earth made thumping 
sounds in answer to his running. 
His heart and legs pumped in har- 
mony. The nectar of his blood 
coursed affectionately through 
every vein. 

The boy ahead of him jumped a 
creek stumbled on the bank, scram- 
bled to his feet and ran on. Massel 



62 



IF 




cleared the water easily, soaring in- 
to the feathery grass high on the 
creek bank, reciting as he ran lines 
of ambrosial verse: “By brooks too 
broad for leaping, the light-foot 
boys are laid ...” 

Sailing over a gnarled root, Mas- 
sel went on remembering: “The 
rose-lipped girls are sleeping, in 
fields where roses fade.” 

“Ah ...” Massel thought as he 
ran, “When I was one and twenty, 
I heard a wise man say ...” The 
breeze cuffed him gently, and he 
ran, the muscles in his legs flowing 
golden. He could hear the bells of 
distant towers, the nearer warbling 
of wild finches, and the brooks and 
streams competing with the birds in 
song. “But there is no rue within 
my heart now,” Massel improvised. 
The other boy was now only a few 
strides ahead of him. To run, his 
mind whispered — to run, to run. 
Massel spoke to his legs; they com- 
plied and he reached out with a 
sinewy but boyish arm — 

'T'he “Light Year” decelerated 
to a halt and the two young 
passengers sat rigidly in their seats, 
stunned and thinking murky inde- 
cisive thoughts. Ten meters behind 
them, Massel deactivated the stun- 
ners mounted on the front of his 
auto, then leaned back to watch 
the two boys quietly. 

The boys would remain pacific 
for an hour, Massel thought, and 
long before an hour has passed, the 



ped-cops would have arrived to take 
custody. All Massel had to do was 
wait, staying inside his vehkJe. But 
it wasn’t frustrating, really. 

In fact, Massel no longer thought 
about the matter at all. His mind 
would not let him. 

Long ago the frustration had 
waned — the past ulcerous frus- 
tration of having to wait for the 
arrival of fellow officers who were 
physically able to leave their vehi- 
cles and walk around. Now Massel 
had even forgotten that he'd once 
been prey to that humili — that 
frustra — those confused feelings . 

Massel sat quietly in fcte auto, 
thinking of blue skies, pebbled 
streams and the wispy insects of 
flower fields — read about so often 
that their past existence was pres- 
ent reality — instead of the web 
of neural-wires that joined the 
nerves in the stumps of las ampu- 
tated legs to the controls of his 
police vehicle. 

Staring ahead, Massel dreamed of 
legs. 

I n the University-Suburb Riot 
8 three years before — the 
same riot that had left his wife and 
son burnt alive by “serious” dem- 
onstrators brandishing flame- 
throwers — Massel’s legs had been 
burned, too, into uselessness. 

Subsequent to the accident, he 
had requested — as was most hon- 
orable for a dedicated federal 
police officer — to be fused with an 



AUTOHUMAN 14 



63 




5uto, made into one of the two 
dozen or so elite autohumans who 
served the law with their perfect 
coordination of human mind and 
steel body. Nerves joined to wires, 
to rocket controls, airfoil activators, 
lights and weapons; Massel could 
issue ten major commands to his 
vehicular body with the nerves that 
had once led to his legs. He liked to 
think of those commands as his ten 
lost toes. 

The operation had been delicate, 
but successful — typically success- 
ful. “No mental or physical prob- 
lems in recuperation or psycholo- 
gical adjustment.” Typically suc- 
cessful, they’d all said. 

Massel was contented now, even 
when his mental defenses dropped 
for the duration of a thought or 
two and he had to admit he was 
an autohuman. All autohumans, as 
reports emphasized, were very well 
adjusted to their condition. Some- 
times the catheter leading to Mas- 
sel ’s bladder was annoying, when 
it leaked or scraped him. And some- 
times the cramps in his body, the 
result of too many hours on the 
freeways, left him few hours of 
sleep at night, as he dozed fitfully 
in the dim garages of various police 
stations. But all in all, Massel knew 
he was well-adjusted . 

Or rather well-adjusted enough . 
His daydreams — his “defensive 
fantasies,” as he rarely admitted — 
were his concern alone, as long as 
they didn’t cause accidents or gen- 



eral incompetency. And his didn’t. 
When he needed — as he often 
badly needed — to bathe and drink 
of the old poetry in his copy of 
A Shropshire Lad, that very old 
book of verse was right there in the 
glove compartment ready for his 
* reach and reading. 

The book had been a gift from a 
neighbor of the past, a University 
professor who had wanted the past 
badly, just as Massel — No, Mas- 
sel never thought about all of that. 
He had once and for all told him- 
self he would forget the professor’s 
name and everything about those 
years — the years before the cities 
began to cover everything, before 
the universities were “adopted” by 
the federal government, before his 
legs were — He would forget be- 
cause he had his poetry, much more 
real than reality, than those days 
before his legs — He should have 
been a Shropshire lad, from a cen- 
tury or two ago. He should have 
been, so he would forget . 

As he continued to tell himself, 
daydreams were his own af- 
fair, as long as they caused no 
accidents, as long as he continued 
to function efficiently. Chances 
were that his defense-fantasies 
would have no negative effects on 
his performance. There had been 
only one autohuman who had failed 
in the history of the fed-police; be- 
cause of distracting self-pity, that 
autohuman had let a psychopath 



64 



IF 




suspected of two murders evade him 
on the freeway, and as a result his 
autohuman status had been reduced 
to perma-monitor with a life of im- 
mobility, HQ radio communica- 
tions work, and only spectator 
status in the police world . 

MassePs thoughts in this vein 
trailed off when he looked up at 
the Light Year beyond his car hood 
and saw one of the two young men 
— dressed in a green plastic jacket 
struggle slowly from the car. The 
stunner’s effect had worn off, Mas- 
sel realized, and both youths were 
peanut-brained enough to try a run 
from the freeway. And the ped- 
cops? Even later than usual . 

Massel started to activate the 
stunners again, but his synaptical 
command snapped off when a 
police vehicle with two ped-officers 
hissed and screamed to a stop be- 
hind him. One of the officers 
leaped from the car, waved what 
seemed to be a hand-stunner, and 
in a moment had run past Massel, 
stopped in front of him, and was 
taking aim at the farther of the two 
youths fleeing on foot down the 
shoulder of the freeway. 

Instead of the bluish waver of 
a stunner’s beam, the ped-officer’s 
weapon issued a boiling line of 
energy. 

Massel jerked in surprise. A hand- 
raser? Since when was HQ ordering 
rasers for a situation like this? 

Then Massel remembered that 
headquarters had attached the ad- 



jective “dangerous” to the report 
on the two young men out there on 
the freeway. Because they were 
carrying hand-rasers themselves, 
that made them dangerous? Massel 
didn’t think so, and the presence of 
a ped-officer with a flared-beam 
raser for a weapon seemed melo- 
dramatic. 

The raser’s beam struck the 
youth, and the aura of melodrams 
dissolved. The beam had struck the 
suspect in the legs. 

Legs! Massel’s mind froze, and 
his throat held back a scream. Legs! 
In his trance he saw the young 
man fall on the asphalt, clutching 
at his legs, which looked wet, 
smoking and gnarled all at once 
in the night’s dimness. 

In the continuing trance Massel 
stared at the ped-officer, an unfam- 
iliar growl escaping his lips. Almost 
unconsciously, he activated his 
stunners and focused them — on 
the ped-officer, who threw up his 
arms, flung his weapon away in a 
spasm, stiffened and fell to the 
pavement. 

Full focus was fatal nine out of 
ten times, Massel remembered 
faintly. Everything in hie senses 
seemed faint now. 

Massel stared at the wounded 
youth, at the crippled legs, then 
activated all power in his own body. 
The engine spoke to him, telling 
him to flee, reminding him about 
the autohuman who had erred and 
was now an immobile radio upera- 



AUTOHUMAN 14 



65 




tor. But he was trapped, vulnerable 
within his own steel, unless he — 

TTnless he ran. Massel had won 
lU one chase, an easy race, and 
now he would be the one chased. 
But he was fast His legs were 
strong. For another moment Mas- 
sel allowed himself to lounge bn 
the grass toying with a buttercup 
and listening to the sighs of cir- 
cling bees. Words like Light Year 
and Freeline and 'autohuman drifted 
against the bath of his mind, but 
dissolved when he thought of bisects 
instead of buzzing words. To run, 
to run, his mind suggested. "By 



brooks too broad for leaping,” his 
mind remembered sagely, reciting. 
Not far from him on the grass lay 
a young man, the man he had been 
chasing, and now this young man’s 
legs Were hurting — the same

too would not be allowed ever again 
to touch that velvet grass with his 
own two feet any time he wanted

Spork 

Conquers 

Civilization 

by PERRY A. CHAPDELAINE 



Illustrated by REESE 



When Spork of the Ayor discovered 
human civilization , he was in for 
a shock — hut so was civilization I 



I 

As the oldest untwinned mem- 
ber of the Ayorian race, I 
naturally led the expedition into 
the Quations system. 

Since the dawn of Enithra’s 
creation, and the Ayorian type of 



evolution which followed, the fig- 
ure-eight-shaped Ayor has been 
bound by two immutable laws of 
survival — twinning and grouping. 
Each Ayor must create and ac* 
cept a personal commitment toward 
solving philosophical, scientific or 
Other types of problems to promotg 



a 





his own maturity and descendents. 
Upon successful completion of the 
accepted problem, the Ayor twins 
in a very natural way, producing 
two children similar in their figure- 
eight structure to the former adult, 
but each with greatly improved 
capacity for problem solving in the 
direction of the accepted twinning 
problem. Twinning, therefore, pro- 
vides a kind of radially-divergent 
evolutionary path for the Ayor. 

Though my biology was human, 
I had been adopted as an infant 
by one of the Ayor and trained in 
Ayorian ways. After my beloved 
Erne had completed my neuronic 
growth enabling me to use Ayorian 
faculties of telekmass — mass sens- 
ing and teleporting — I fully ex- 
pected to twin once. I had resolved 
my twinning problem which was: 
“Who am I and what is my pur- 
pose?” 

Since the Ayorian species main- 
tains its singleness of racial integ- 
rity by grouping, where each Ayor 
places the magnetic structure of his 
being, cup to hemisphere, against 
another in a very long chain, thus 
enabling each individual Ayor to 
exchange personal experiences and 
the race as a whole to arrive at 
group decisions, I had had great 
difficulty in convincing the Ayor 
that their proper racial thrust was 
outward, toward the stars. 

Eventually, however, we over- 
came the Tepen, a degenerate ev- 
olutionary offshoot of the Ayor who 

68 



had once preyed on us, and opened 
the door to more progressive group- 
ing decisions. 

When Toby Randolph, slave 
scientist from the Quations system, 
crashed on Enithra, we Ayorians 
quickly learned to build spaceships 
by means of both direct action — 
use of tools and their products — 
as well as indirect action — telek- 
mass faculties. 

But once we had left our own 
little planet to visit others of our 
system, we encountered the beast 
of planet two, a mindless entity 
that had used its irresistible telek- 
mass faculties to strip planets one 
and two down to their radioactive 
ingredients and had constructed it- 
self to be virtually three times the 
size of our own planet, Enithra. 

T Tsing both Tepen and human 
^ science, we were able to cap- 
ture, but not kill, the beast, placing 
it under telekmass shield from the 
positions of the debris of planets 
one and two. Now we were free to 
return Toby Randolph to his own 
system; I was free to continue my 
personal twinning problem; and my 
Ayor brothers, ten thousand 
strong, were free to plant another 
culture like ours among the stars. 

Unlike my Ayor brothers, I am 
tall, muscular, dark-skinned and 
have light receptors which are vio- 
let hued. My wide-set eyes and 
athletic build would probably have 
made many a ship captain from 

IF 




human worlds envious, though, to 
the Ayor, I was still Spork the 
moron, because of my limited telek- 
mass faculties. 

Still I was the most experienced 
Ayorian for the purpose and was 
therefore chosen as the expedition’s 
leader. 

We entered the Quations system 
uneventfully and were approaching 
halfway to Toby Randolph’s planet 
of Feren when the missile struck. 
Our very naivete destroyed the ship; 
for, had we known of the extent to 
which humans prey upon one an- 
other, we could easily have prevent- 
ed the disaster which followed. 

Our concept of struggle did not 
include the idea of direct-action 
devices, though I had killed the 
evil Tepen by means of rocks, clubs 
and fists. Since we did not consider 
ourselves to be Tepen, to be open- 
ly attacked by members of Ran- 
dolph’s civilization without prior 
warning or provocation, we did not 
look for their immediate survival 
threat. 

Apparently the explosive mass 
struck our ship and released large 
quantities of chemical energy which 
expanded rapidly, vaporizing part 
of the ship’s hull and killing Toby. 
I was knocked unconscious; and 
in the resulting confusion, all 
the other Ayor teleported them- 
selves to the nearest planet. 

The explosion split the ship; one 
half carried the now dead Toby 
Randolph, and my half accelerated 
SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



well beyond the sensing range of the 
Ayor. 

When I regained consciousness, 
my legs and arms were shackled by 
heavy metal bands while my back 
lay against a hard metallic wall. 
All around my immediate vicinity 
I perceived heavily riveted metal 
sheets. “How odd!” was my first 
thought. “Is this civilization?” 

Now free of Enithra’s eternally 
searching plant and animal life, my 
own telekmass sensors extended 
their full eighty-mile limit. As in 
empty space away from Enithra’s 
surface, the telekinetic silence was 
pronounced; nowhere could I feel 
the least of telekinetic fingers 
plucking for self-nourishment. 

As my senses moved outward 
from me, I noted humans with 
metal pellet-accelerating tubes, 
then other humans in different 
poses — some eating with the 
mouth as did Toby Randolph, some 
sleeping; others were laying small 
cards on a table in unpredictable 
patterns; and many other humans 
were behaving In strange and un- 
usual ways. All of them were dressed 
with clothing of similar design and 
pattern. 

T reached through several lay- 
* ers of metal cubicles, each of 
similar construction to mine, before 
encountering the planet’s surface. 
Here I could sense fresh air mixed 
with fuel exhaust from hundreds 
of ships — some posed for flight, 

69 





some landing, some just resting. 

Other buildings scattered here 
and there surrounded the space 
field. Some contained machinery of 
a complex nature while others were 
filled with containers holding un- 
stable chemical or radioactive mix- 
tures. 

Approaching me I could sense a 
huge human with coarse, heavy eye- 
brows and puckered nose. Like 
everything and everyone else, he 
was walking with his own muscles. 

The human at my door opened it, 
and the newcomer stepped into my 
cubicle, exploding words at me. 
“Pig! Where are the rest of the 
rotting Ventery family?” 

I didn’t know what a pig was, 
but experience with Toby Ran- 
dolph’s emotional outbursts taught 
me that this human was angry. 

Greatly curious now, I listened 
and watched with my ears and light 
receptors as well as my telekmass 
sensors. 

Without warning, he struck me 
forcibly across the face. “Pigl 
Answer me!” 

Now I had never been struck 
before. The closest experience to 
physical struggle was my personal 
vendetta and destruction of the Te- 
pen. Ayorian children never have 
need for discipline or punishment, 
and no life on Enithra would have 
used direct-action physical force to 
accomplish an end. 

I was so astonished I failed to re- 
act when he struck me again.

IF 



My mind reached out toward his 
arms and froze them in the act of 
reaching toward me again. 

“Guard! Guard!” he shouted 
loudly with trembling in his voice. 

On the appearance of the human 
from outside my doorway he called, 
“Kill this dog!” 

Again, I didn’t know what a dog 
was, but I could see and sense the 
long metal stick containing chem- 
ically driven pellets as it was raised 
toward me and I knew what “kill” 
meant. 

I used my telekinetic faculties, 
preventing the bullets from explod- 
ing. The first man swiveled around 
and shouted even louder. “Kill the 
pig before I have you hung!” 
Now the frightened guard swung 
his rifle around with intent to crash 
its butt against my face. I froze 
his two arms, then stepped out of 
my shackles to appear behind the 
two men. “I don’t understand what 
civilization is really about, but I 
think it is time for you two humans 
to teach me,” I said. 

II 

A bout seventy miles away I 
could sense a strange tree 
with a moss-like growth covering 
the ground around its base; here I 
teleported the two men, their arms 
and legs still frozen to their sides. 

All around me was the green color, 
just as Toby Randolph had stated. 
The strange tree had green leaves 



and the covering underfoot was 
green. Unlike Enithra ’s lovely vio- 
let and ultraviolet, green foliage 
was predominant! 

I let my mind flow through their 
chemical processes, finding that 
they too eternally sought nourish- 
ment of water, minerals and gases, 
just as did Enithra’s plant life; but 
there the similarity ended. 

Energy supplied by radiation 
from the sun beating directly on 
the wide leaves caused slow chem- 
ical reactions which resulted in 
sugars, proteins and other life 
structures. No wonder Toby had 
felt that all Enithra life moved too 
fast! “Why, at their present rate of 
growth, months might pass before 
they bear seed!” I thought. 

Insects and bacterial growths, 
just as on Enithra, could be sensed 
all around and they, too, followed 
the slow-direct action processes. 
Were it not for my two rude hosts, 
I would have studied these strange 
forms endlessly. 

Turning back to the first, I un- 
froze his speaking apparatus and 
asked, “Why did you strike me?” 
“Pig!” he exclaimed. “You are 
of the house of Venetry. All are 
dogs subject to immediate interro- 
gation and death by our ruler’s 
order! Let us go and I will see that 
you die quickly instead of slowly 
as you most certainly should for 
this insolent action!” 

Not yet understanding the mo- 
tives behind this emotional out- 



SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION

bursts, I squeezed a little of his 
body in sensitive spots until I had 
worked some rationality into him. 

It seems that the ship which we 
had copied was designed by the 
Venetry family — the family to 
which Toby Randolph had belong- 
ed. Not only had we copied its 
silhouette, but also its crest of 
arms, in our passion for detail. 

The new ruling dictator of this 
system Lad given standing orders 
to arrest, interrogate and destroy 
all Venetry family members. I 
gathered this was because of some 
fear on his part that the family 
might legitimately lay some claim 
to the planet’s rule. 

When we naively entered into 
this planetary system, one of their 
powerful spaceship had spotted 
our silhouette and crest, ordered us 
to change direction by means of 
electro-magnetic radiation signals 
and then struck us with their chem- 
ical torpedo when we failed to an- 
swer their challenge. 

"VJo words of mine were accept- 
able to this strangely emo- 
tional human. He didn’t comment 
on the matter of my use of indirect 
faculties; but I’m sure from the 
way he looked all around from time 
to time that he was searching for 
others of my family who might be 
using direct action devices to cause 
the new control phenomenon from 
a distance. 

From the second man I learned 



that soldiers were humans who 
must obey the orders or be killed 
themselves; otherwise he held no 
personal animosity against me. 

“Why would otherwise rational 
beings wish to leave Enithra for the 
doubtful security of civilization, as 
did Toby Randolph?” I wondered. 

Life, all life, was valuable to 
Ayorians. Some life killed other 
life but only for the sake of sur- 
vival. In the cases of the Tepen 
and the beast of planet two, we 
were justified in our actions. But 
here, in my first contact with 
Toby’s civilization, I had my ship 
torn apart, was knocked uncon- 
scious and was jailed and struck 
and cursed with the promise of 
torture and death to come. 

Civilization was becoming ai 
great twinning problem for me I 

Teleporting the two men back to 
my jail cell, I extended my mass 
sensor to the maximum and began 
moving from point to point across 
the planet in search of my Ayorian 
brethren. 

Time and again as I halted at 
teleportation points, I was able to 
sense billions of humans moving 
with the phenomenon of continu- 
ous motion. Not only was this true 
of their plants and animals, but al- 
so of the vehicles in the air, on the 
land and in and on the seas. 
Though anxious to find the other 
Ayorians — who could certainly 
handle anything encountered here 
better than I — I took time to 



72 



IF 




study the strange phenomenon. 

There were monstrously huge 
cities roughly similar to Tepen vil- 
lages, containing literally millions 
of humans! The depth and com- 
plexity of their machines in appli- 
cation of direct-action principles 
was beyond our wildest predictions. 
Tenth, twelfth or even a hundredth 
generation of tool development was 
required to fabricate some items 
which we Ayorians could build on- 
ly by indirect-action means. 

“How,” I wondered time and 
again, “could life so limited, mov- 
ing so slowly in basic accomplish- 
ment — accretion, growth and 
twinning — have evolved such tre- 
mendously complex equipment?” 

My greatest shock came when I 
learned how humans reproduce. 
Ayorians twin. Much Enithra ani- 
mal life transports seed to egg by 
means of teleportation. Here all 
animal life, including humans, 
transport seed by means of direct 
action! 

XJo wonder Erne, when she first 
sensed my presence, wonder- 
ed if I were an animal to be used 
by Tepens in capturing Ayors; for 
humans were certainly closer to 
Enithra animals than to the Ayor. 

Still thinking of myself as an 
Ayor, however, I failed to apply 
the lessons of my emotional shocks 
to my own twinning problem. 

I chose food from many locations 
which seemed to specialize in their 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



accumulation and storage. Night 
came, then daylight again — some- 
what faster than on Enithra. My 
muscles, too, responded quicker 
here than on Enithra, perhaps be- 
cause of the planet’s smaller mass. 

Eventually I located what I 
thought to be a decent hiding place 
where I slept, turning and tossing 
with strange dreams involving the 
fantastic phenomenon of direct ac- 
tion. Terrible nightmares occurred 
of indescribable and equally unbe- 
lievable nature. I dreamed, for ex- 
ample, of the predatory Ettel 
creeping silently up to the vora- 
cious Cien and tearing it apart 
with jaws and paws! The night- 
mare quality was caused by the 
fact that the Ettel has neither jaws 
nor paws and certainly would not 
creep up to the stupid Cien — it 
would teleport the Cien directly in- 
to its stomach sack! 

My choice of a safe hiding place 
for sleep was an empty building 
with doors tightly locked. As al- 
ways my custom, I slept several 
inches above the floor or platform, 
which lay immediately before rows 
of seats; and once asleep, I slept 
soundly with those puzzling dreams 
tumbling through my mind. 

I was awakened suddenly both 
by my awareness of other humans 
now surrounding me and by the 
sound of human giggling and 
laughter. I opened my light recep- 
tors to find the building well light- 
ed and my floating form complete- 

73 




ly surrounded by laughing men and 
hysterically giggling ladies. 

“This is the best performance 
ever!” one man cried. 

“Oh, he doesn’t have any 
clothes!” several ladies screamed. 

I should have known about body 
coverings from Toby Randolph. 
Entertainment houses were a new 
concept to me, however. Needless 
to say, I teleported myself away 
quickly and, from the top of their 
entertainment building, I reached 
out in search of proper clothing. 
Greatly surprised, I found special- 
ized buildings devoted to their 
storage and display. By careful 
scrutiny I soon learned which 
pieces to wear and on what parts 
of my body and in which order. 

Ill 

TT'nithra was about six thousand 
miles in diameter; this planet 
was somewhat lighter, hence prob- 
ably somewhat smaller — perhaps 
only five thousand miles in diam- 
eter. At jumps of nearly eighty 
miles each — closer to seventy- 
five when I figured in my altitude 
— it would take me roughly 2.5 X 
10 7 divided by 6.4 X 10 3 jumps 
just to cover the planet’s surface 
area. It would take around 3,000 
jumps to make a systematic search 
for the Ayor. 

But what if they were five miles 
under the crust in some hidden 
cave? 



Of course, if only one Ayor were 
within a half million miles of me, 
I should already have been found 
by them. 

But then, what if unknown Tep- 
en-like telekinetic fields were being 
used in their capture? Though 
highly unlikely from what I had 
already learned of this planet and 
its occupants, I did not dare chance 
the risk. 

I compromised by searching the 
surface area thoroughly — though 
I must confess part of my reason- 
ing was based upon pure curiosity 
about the humans and their envir- 
onment. 

Figuring on perhaps 100 jumps 
per day, it would take me 30 days; 
and as I finished these mental es- 
timates, I began jumping from 
point to point, stopping long enough 
at each point to search thoroughly 
throughout my sphere of sensitiv- 
ity. 

Within a matter of several 
jumps, I detected tiny masses con- 
taining chemical explosives streak- 
ing toward me. Noting their crude 
similarity to the one which had 
struck our ship, I removed their ex- 
plosive materials and fuel, letting 
them scatter in tiny pieces over the 
ground. 

As my jumps continued, the com- 
pany of missiles increased in num- 
ber. Something or someone was 
learning to predict my probable 
path of appearance! 

I changed my tactics then by 

IF 



74 




teleporting from point to point 
along the ground surface of Feren, 
as the planet was named. 

Thirty days of thoroughly 
searching the planet’s surface left 
me with knowledge more complete 
than I had held of my beloved En- 
ithra. 

Feren had several large bodies of 
water; and near each pole, snow 
covered the surface to great depths. 
Much land was cultivated and, 
from overhead, appeared multi- 
colored, checkered and sometimes 
puckered. 

G reat sweeps of the planet’s 
continents were devoted to 
the activities of soldiers and their 
implements. They were to be found 
in the cities, in the country, on and 
in the sea, in specially built thick- 
metalled ships, in the farm areas 
and in specially built reservations 
consisting often of rocket ports and 
other facilities. 

Missiles ringed the planet in 
such a manner that they could eas- 
ily cover every square foot of sur- 
face area in a very few minutes. 

One military base was unusual 
because of its strength when com- 
pared to the others. Surrounded by 
thousands of missiles and other un- 
known protective machinery, its 
cavern-like building was rooted to 
the planet’s bed-rock by means of 
flotation apparatus capable of 
holding the peculiarly dense metal 
surrounding it all. 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



I didn’t find the Ayor. They 
might have died from the chemical 
explosive; or with their reaction 
time, most likely they had teleport- 
ed themselves from the damaged 
ship to the other planet. 

There was only one way to dis- 
cover the truth. Since I couldn’t 
very well manufacture my own 
ship, I chose a large, swift looking 
craft which appeared to be well 
cared for and of about the same 
size as ours had been. 

Though differences in some in- 
struments caused a little delay, I 
soon determined their function. I 
moved the ship’s guards away from 
the blast area and accelerated up- 
ward rapidly. My mind flickered 
from missile to missile, telekmass- 
ing at least three hundred before 
their attempts ended. 

Time had changed the relative 
positions of the planets with re- 
spect to the position of our ship’s 
destruction; but like any Ayorian, 
I knew exactly where their spatial 
referents were and where each must 
now be, relative to one another. In 
my mind’s imagination I could 
sense the seventh planet in one di- 
rection, while fragments of my old 
ship sped in the opposite direction. 

Soon faster and more sophisti- 
cated missiles tore through space 
to find me. These were also deac- 
tivated as soon as they reached 
within my eighty-mile telekmass 
limits. 

Though I could easily deacti- 

75 




vate even those designed for one 
hundred per cent mass conversion, 
sooner or later one would be fused 
to explode near or beyond my 
eighty-mile limits. If so, not even 
my Ayorian faculties would save 
me from the energy release of the 
explosion. 

I now directed my ship toward 
the incoming missiles and within 
ten thousand miles I discovered an 
orbiting military satellite. It was 
gigantic, filled with soldiers and 
weapons of offense, and could eas- 
ily have stopped me had the hu- 
mans known my nature and my 
limitations. 

I flung their missile ingredients 
toward the sun and only then felt 
free to return to my quest for the 
Ayor. 

\ s the ship approached the 
planet most likely to hold my 
Ayorian brethren, I came within 
the half-million-mile sensing range. 
One of the Ayor immediately tele- 
ported to my ship, where we greet- 
ed one another with great affection 
and happiness. 

He guided me to a large cavern 
hollowed out of barren rock below 
the planet’s raw atmosphere. For- 
tunately, by their capability of 
reaching below the molecular level, 
the Ayor were able to create new 
molecular forms to provide them- 
selves with food, water and oxygen. 

My ship was easily transported 
into their cavern where all the Ay- 



orians grouped to show their wel- 
come and their joy over Spork the 
moron’s return. 

I naturally felt a strong sense of 
belonging as I perceived the dis- 
play hovering above me. Cup to 
hemisphere, they tied themselves 
one to another and spoke in unison 
as was their custom. “Welcome 
back, Spork!” Their great booming 
voice bounced from wall to wall 
within the cavern. 

My light receptors watered 
strangely at this magnificent dis- 
play of brotherhood and warmth. 

The planet was cold, lifeless and 
inhospitable; its surface was crys- 
talled over with frozen radicals in- 
volving complex and simple hydro- 
gens, methanes, ammonia and wa- 
ter. 

I could well appreciate the stu- 
pendous task which these Ayor had 
undertaken. 

Blown compulsively from our 
ship by explosive, they had tele- 
ported to this planet, carved out a 
habitable cavern and stocked it 
with life nutrients within a matter 
of hours. Then, dividing up their 
talents, some had begun to re- 
structure the total atmosphere of 
the planet, changing it from a re- 
ducing to an oxidizing atmosphere. 
Others had been busy reconstruct- 
ing a new spaceship from unre- 
fined materials easily found 
throughout the planet. 

To my knowledge, no race before 
had attempted the use of indirect 

IF 



76 




faculties on such a grand scale. 
Twinning was frequent — made in- 
evitable by the difficult twinning 
problems in need of solution when 
transforming a whole planet. 

'T'ime passed while some gains 
were made on the planet’s at- 
mosphere. 

My personal twinning problem, 
again, became the dominant theme 
within my mind. It would be easy 
to force the people of Feren under 
our will, but was this way best? 
Eventually we Ayor would need 
allies in our search for individual 
and racial fulfillment. Would a 
race under our domination and con- 
trol, like one of their beasts-of- 
burden, be likely to provide this 
need? No! It seemed unlikely that 
raw force was an answer to the 
problem. 

Meanwhile, other youthful Ayor- 
ians, uninterested in planet trans- 
formation, clamored for a different 
sort of twinning problem. 

A time of proper grouping came 
where each shared his personal ex- 
periences and desires with every 
other and I was asked, “Spork! 
Where does your twinning problem 
lead?” 

“To Feren,” I shouted to the 
group overhead. 

“Will you take more of the Ayor 
along?” 

“Yes, if their twinning problem 
also lies in that direction.” 

“Very well,” they thundered to- 



gether. “Fifty thousand will ac- 
company you in further contacts 
elsewhere and the other half have 
elected to stay.” 

“We have concluded,” they con- 
tinued, “that survival considera- 
tions require the Ayor to remain 
hidden as yet. We are too small 
in number to risk further dangers 
at this time.” 

“How will we meet the Ferenian 
humans, then?” I asked. 

“Your body is biologically human 
and you know their language. 
Learn to pass yourself as one of 
them. Mix with them and learn 
what you can.” 

The Ayorian grouping wisdom 
usually impressed me and this time 
was no exception, although, for a 
moment, my body felt deep resent- 
ment at their reference to my bio- 
logical similarities. 

“I accept the suggestion,” I an- 
swered boldly, “and may all of my 
brethren have good twinning!” 

“Good twinning to Spork!” they 
replied together. 

IV 

TTTe swept through the ineffec- 
* * tive human detection system 
and burrowed deep within the 
ground of Feren, hiding the ship 
and my fifty thousand brothers. 

I chose a city at random, to 
appear on one of its empty streets 
and begin deliberate attempts to 
mingle with the population, hoping 

IF 



78 




to gain knowledge of their culture 
and the motives behind their 
strange and complex behavior pat- 
terns. 

The day was bright and cool in 
my chosen location. And all that 
first day, I briskly walked up and 
down various concrete paths form- 
ed within their cities. 

No one could believe how many 
details could be telekmass-sensed 
in an eighty-mile sphere within a 
city unless, like us, he had telek- 
mass senses. Only the microscopic 
detail of natural biology could ex- 
ceed it for complexity! 

Humans walked into specially 
prepared buildings to eat. When in 
need of nourishment, I followed one 
group and entered where food was 
automatically served on plastic 
trays. Carefully watching the man 
ahead with my light receptors in 
order to imitate his every move, I 
picked up a tray. 

The man selectively dialed food 
combinations, and I did the same. 
Just as I was congratulating myself 
on my successful mimicry, he 
reached into his pocket and brought 
out metal coins and pieces of fi- 
brous paper; he handed these to a 
machine which accepted them and 
returned similar objects. 

I had no small metal objects of 
fibrous paper! 

The machine blinked and said, 
“That will be 1.56 Odell, please!” 

Thinking rapidly, I reached into 
the human’s pocket behind me and 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



placed some of his fibrous paper 
in my right-hand pocket. Toby had 
told me of their monetary system 
but I was quite ignorant of its im- 
plications. 

Did I or did I not have 1.56 
Odell in my pockets now? 

I withdrew the recently acquired 
paper, handing all of it to the 
machine. 

“Oh my goodness,” it said. “I 
said one point five six Odell, not 
one hundred and fifty six.” 

It took only one paper-piece; 
then, as I turned to lift my tray 
manually as I had seen others do, 
it called me back to take my 
change. 

The rest of my meal was without 
incident. 

Since the metal pieces and the 
fibrous paper seemed to represent 
important symbols of exchange to 
these people, I felt I should learn 
where they came from and what 
they meant. 

nphe next day I studied every 
**• place where money moved or 
was kept, becoming quite perplexed. 
Most everyone had it. Some hu- 
mans seemed to work for it while 
others seemed to store huge quan- 
tities of it in protected places; still 
others handed it out to some for 
their immediate use, though they 
appeared to not work for it; one 
place actually manufactured it, 
then stored it in other places. 

I had worked with the Ayor in 

79 




the most complicated areas. We 
had overcome the evil Tepen and 
the beast of planet two, learned of 
modern mathematics and science 
and built spaceships and many 
other things; yet this culture, sup- 
posedly similar to the one of my 
biological origin, was most confus- 
ing and complex. 

Before I learned about schools, 
I was in trouble again! 

To move from one city to an- 
other, the humans boarded public 
vehicles which might be any of 
several kinds of transportation. At 
each terminal, guards demanded to 
see a little card from each person 
before he could board the vehicle. 

Assuming the card was part of 
their confusing monetary system, I 
teleported one from the purse of a 
female human behind me. I naively 
handed the card to the guard, not 
noticing the picture on its surface 
and its writing which stated her 
sex, size, weight and so on. 

The guard took the card, looked 
at the picture and then asked the 
lady behind me for her card. Of 
course the lady didn’t have one, so 
I teleported one to her purse from 
the man behind her. She handed 
this card to the guard. 

The guard glanced at this card, 
then asked for one from the next 
man. The activity continued for 
six more cards while the guard held 
on to my original stolen card. 

“All right,” he said, “how many 
of you are together?” 



Not one of them answered. 

Politely handing the proper cards 
back to the right individuals, he 
grabbed my arm and placed me 
under arrest. I went along with him 
since I was most curious about this 
custom. 

I was jailed again! 

It seemed that each citizen had 
need for identification papers which 
vouched for the fact that he was 
who he was and showed where he 
was permitted to do business which 
was fully approved by the state. 

The jail regime was boringly dif- 
ferent from my experience with the 
military, and teleporting outward 
was delayed only long enough for 
me to learn this fact. 

Schools were next! 

I enthusiastically enrolled in one 
which specialized in adult educa- 
tion. How disappointed I became 
when I learned that their rate of 
learning was slow — as slow as their 
green colored plant growths. At 
their rate, I would need to attend 
for dozens of years simply to learn 
two or three subjects well; I could 
not afford the time. 

But I did meet books of every 
description — psychology, sociolo- 
gy, political science, military sci- 
ence, economics, literature, art, 
music, history and various strange 
languages. 

I had full recall of a six-month- 
old child’s memory of my 
father speaking to my mother while 

IF

our ship spun toward Enithra. 
“Though we headed the house of 
the galactic council, Patricia, the 
sabotage was inevitable. We may 
be genetically superior, but to the 
common people we are still only 
human. Place the baby in the life 
container now.” Erne, also, had 
passed down to me the words, 
“HEART OF THE HOUSE OF 
THE GALACTIC COUNCIL,” in- 
scribed on our ship. None of the 
language books held knowledge 
corresponding to the written or 
spoken language of my origin. 

Economics made much of their 
monetary system understandable, 
but I still failed to understand how 
money came into being. What 
started the process? Energy, com- 
modities, goods and services could 
be added to a community; but how 
could money be arbitrarily created 
and then arbitrarily placed into 
isomorphic correspondence with 
these things? Was the law of con- 
servation of matter-energy some- 
how repealed? 

I learned the descriptive lan- 
guage of sociology and psychology, 
understanding the behavior de- 
scribed therein; but the phenomen- 
on itself remained unreal. 

The history books, however, were 
at first my greatest puzzlement. 
Each book seemed to be written by 
the same person. I failed, always 
to reconcile the meaning of the 
words to actuality. This planet was 
a military police state but the 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



history books referred to it as the 
“beneficial democracy surrounding 
us everywhere.” 

The paradox, as paradoxes usual- 
ly do, eventually pointed the way 
toward an understanding of the 
culture of this planet. 

Thinking to move faster in my 
learning efforts, I directly ap- 
proached a human teacher and ask- 
ed for an explanation of Feren’s 
political paradox. He called the 
security police and again I was 
jailed as some kind of enemy of the 
state 1 

Though teleporting out of jail- 
houses seemed to be my chief new 
occupation, I was beginning to 
learn! 

The next three instructors ap- 
proached by me refused to discuss 
the subject. But I persisted in my 
search until, one day, a very eld- 
erly human raised his fingers to his 
lips in their symbol for verbal 
caution; then, writing an address 
and a time on a slip of paper, he 
handed it to me as he quickly left 
the room. 

His house was built low, hunk- 
ered down between taller buildings 
on either side. Colored ceramic 
fibers impregnated in a matrix of 
concrete provided its decor; it was 
old compared to buildings on either 
side and it held space in reserve 
for his private use, as did all hu- 
man structures. 

I activated the door announcer, 
wondering if I were to be jailed 

81 




again. He answered, standing tall 
with his long white hair curling 
delicately upward at the tips. Be- 
hind him, I could see and sense 
four other people in the house. 

He smiled in cheerful recogni- 
tion, his bushy-haired eyebrows 
raised slightly at the corners during 
the process. I was invited in and 
given a soft chair and a cool drink; 
he introduced me to two human 
females and two human males. 
“These are my students,” he said. 
“These are the only ones who have 
had the courage to question.” 

“I realize that questioning the 
state can lead to jail,” I com- 
mented, “but how do you know 
that I do not represent the po- 
lice?” 

“Oh!” he laughed, “I have had 
much dealing with police states in 
my life. You were entirely too awk- 
ward to represent them. You could 
not have passed their training pro- 
grams and remained as innocent as 
you appear!” 

V 

nprod Gerard taught me and I 
^ learned that the Quations 
planetary system had once been a 
newly settled, outlying territory of 
a distant confederation known as 
the Galactic Council. As the galac- 
tic civilization spread, communica- 
tion and control problems develop- 
ed for governing bodies. I could 
understand communication and 



control problems, since we Ayor- 
ians had made our decision to de- 
velop independent colonies because 
of our forecast of similar difficul- 
ties. Indeed, our problems were 
just beginning in that respect. 

When humans were first faced 
with the communication and con- 
trol problem, their science was vig- 
orously applied to breed a special 
class of human who was just a little 
more intelligent, a little faster in 
reflex, a little superior in most hu- 
man respects. These genetically 
bred humans were trained to be 
controlling leaders of far-reaching, 
sprawling, complex galactic confed- 
erations. 

But even improved biology did 
not save the union; the solution 
was applied too late, the genetically 
bred controllers were not quite cap- 
able of the feat, and the confeder- 
ation was fragmented by selfish, 
authoritative humans whose only 
goal was self-aggrandizement and 
plunder. 

The great galactic unions fell 
apart, with each part fought over 
and split into smaller and smaller 
pieces until, like this planet Feren, 
each piece was ruled by power- 
hungry dictators. 

Feren’s dictator — D’Cela — 
who was certainly as bad as the 
predecessor who had ruled Toby 
Randolph’s slave-state, now con- 
trolled the police and soldiers who 
enforced his will on unwilling hu- 
mans. 



82 



IF 




The many pleasant days "study- 
ing under this brave old man also 
taught me that the paranoic ag- 
gressive treatment which we Ayor- 
ians had experienced to date was 
an act of one group and not typi- 
cal behavior for the whole human 
race as, for example, the Tepen was 
not representative of the Ayor. 

Trod Gerard had once been on 
the ruling board of Feren; now he 
was hiding his real activities, 
though his extreme age gave him 
immunity of a sort. Probably 
D’Cela’s followers would only kill 
him outright rather than torture 
him, in deference to his age. 

With my Ayorian faculties 
searching for detail, I roamed the 
planet at will, checking on his ev- 
ery lesson. 

D ’Cela’s fortress and permanent 
living quarters were the gi- 
gantic military installation which 
my telekmass sensors had identi- 
fied to be unique among all of Fer- 
en’s military bases during my first 
planetary survey. “If I am to de- 
termine the final truth of what I 
have learned, I must visit D’Cela,” 
I concluded. 

The nature of his protections 
was complex, subtle and fantastic 
to an extreme, indicating that 
D’Cela was a badly frightened hu- 
man. I teleported into the nearest 
empty room — past the heavy met- 
al shell of the fortress and the ra- 
dioactive fires raging between lay- 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



ers of this shell, through double- 
thick layers of diamond-hard car- 
bon embedded in matrices of iri- 
dium, platinum and nickel and 
through layers of other exotic ma- 
terials, into an empty room. 

The room’s doors slammed shut, 
alarms rang and gas screamed into 
the space. Had I been just a trifle 
slower of reflex, death would have 
found me then. I teleported the 
gas away as fast as it spewed in- 
ward. My mind raced, thinking 
over the fanaticism of this man 
who prepared even empty rooms 
within his citadel as death traps 
for the unwary. What if the next 
room had a death ray instead of 
gas? 

The only safe place was beside 
D’Cela himself, I concluded. 

I quickly teleported to his side. 
Upon observing me, he dropped his 
food, reached for the row of but- 
tons on his desk and then froze 
like a human wooden mannikin as 
I telekmassed both his arms and 
legs. 

He was fat, corpulent and slop- 
py — greasy food still dribbled 
down his stubbled chin. His hair, 
uncombed, was brown and short. 
He dressed in some sort of toga- 
like robe within which I could 
sense several kinds of weapons 
which he must have thought to be 
hidden. 

Along the sides of his desk were 
rows of buttons and behind his 
back were various communication 

83 




racks. The emblem of his state, a 
flag containing his clean-shaven 
likeness in purple and gold, was the 
only object higher than himself. 

Otherwise the room appeared 
barren, probably deliberately made 
uncomfortable for others. I sensed 
the supposedly secret escape-way 
beneath his desk leading downward 
below the level of the planet’s bed- 
rock. And along the walls and ceil- 
ings were mechanical killing ma- 
chines of various types which, I was 
sure, must be connected to some of 
the buttons at his desk. 

1 released his speaking appara- 
tus. “We will talk together. 
I am Spork of the Ayor. You are 
D’Cela. Why do you wish to con- 



trol the planet Feren and its hu- 
mans?” 

“Insolent pig!” was his only 
comment. 

By now I knew that a pig was a 
kind of animal found with humans 
everywhere which was relished for 
food but abhorred for its supposed- 
ly filthy eating habits. Still I won- 
dered why so many members of his 
tribe greeted strangers with the 
word. 

I tightened the muscles about 
his heart and watched him strug- 
gle as he tried to grasp his aching 
chest with arms frozen tightly to 
his side. 

“Now you will answer?” I asked. 

“What are you? Some kind of 
devil? I must be dreaming this. 









Too much liquor. Yes, yes, too 
much liquor.” 

He took decent recognition of 
me when I squeezed his heart again. 
Almost with pity, I listened to his 
odd tale. As a child he had had a 
difficult time, always scrabbling 
and fighting for crusts of bread. 
Fighting and winning, he pushed 
his way upward in search of secur- 
ity until he controlled all those who 
could possibly hurt him. Emphati- 
cally he intended to maintain his 
position, too. 

“To gain personal security,” I 
said, “you would sacrifice the se- 
curity of this planet’s billions?” 

“They want to be controlled. 
People come in two types. Either 
they are stronger than you or weak- 
er. If weaker, they need the leader- 
ship of the stronger. Without this 
arrangement, great inefficien- 
cies develop and there is waste in 
resources and energies.” He felt 
strongly about his position as his 
planet’s savior, while his voice 
worked ever-upward in emotional 
dialectics. 

How odd were his rationaliza- 
tions! Especially so when I con- 
trasted the simple social structure 
of the Ayor with his. What would 
D’Cela have thought to know that 
children as well as adult Ayorians 
might spend years in random play 
or experiment solely for personal 
fulfillment. What kind of waste 
would he call that? How would he 
attempt to control it? 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



I could feel his arm and leg mus- 
cles struggle again to reach his pro- 
tective devices when I said, “I un- 
derstand the Feren people were 
once free to select their own lead- 
ers.” 

“Bah! Rigged elections. Crooked 
politics.” 

“Still, there was more personal 
fulfillment and happiness then, was 
there not?” 

“The state is the only creation 
which has a right to fulfillment.” 

Soon I was convinced that D’ 
Cela, though human, was of the 
evil Tepen personality. Were he a 
Tepen biologically, I would have 
crushed him then. But as an Ayor- 
ian, what right did I have to de- 
termine the fate of a whole planet? 
Yet, there was a way common to 
both Ayorian and human by which 
truth could be known. Determined 
to put that means into effect, I 
teleported to the cavern of the 
Ayor at the same time I released 
D’Cela from his telekinetic chains. 

T tossed with sleeplessness as I 
reviewed the merits and de- 
merits of my plan. In the morning 
I approached Trod Gerard for his 
mature human advice. He laughed 
hugely, as though I were yet an 
infant — one with futile, naive 
imaginings and fantasies and who 
must be humored out of his de- 
lusion. 

I had forgotten that to him I 
was still an ordinary Ferenian citi- 

85 




zen in search of political and his- 
torical truth rather than an Ayor- 
ian from another planetary system. 

Through special lenses I let him 
view the Ayor, fifty thousand 
strong, in our hidden cavern below 
ground. Once he appreciated the 
subtlety and power of our telek- 
mass faculties he was wildly, en- 
thusiastically cooperative over my 
scheme. 

With their long-range sensors, 
the other Ayor studied the planet’s 
defenses in detail. Fifty thousand 
Ayorians fanned their telekmass 
sensors outward in search of ex- 
plosives, both nuclear and chemi- 
cal, as well as bullets, death rays, 
bombs, projectiles and other po- 
tential means for killing or control- 
* ling humans. Their senses swept 
through the planet with accustomed 
agility as the assignment itself re- 
flected sober uses for their early 
childhood days of hide-and-seek on 
Enithra. 

All control objects were tossed 
toward the sun from a half million 
miles outward. 

Armed now with only muscle 
and club, D’Cela’s police state end- 
ed suddenly. Incapable of stem- 
ming the people’s vengeful tide, the 
dictator and his crew barely es- 
caped from the planet Feren and 
only by chance. 

I was confident this would be the 
people’s choice; yet, as I had 
taught the Ayor, conjectures must 
be adequately tested when using 

86 



direct-action faculties and this 
problem seemed analogous. 

Representative democracy re- 
turned to Feren; Trod Gerard was 
well known, popular with most of 
the population and a personal 
friend of most of the elected offi- 
cials. He insured that Spork and 
the still hidden Ayor were given all 
credit though an aura of impene- 
trable mystery surrounded the 
means. Nothing we could ask was 
denied us though our wants were 
few in number. 

When I was made Honorary 
Planetary President I felt a strange 
sense of emotional tie with these 
strange humans. “Am I becoming 
human, too?” I wondered. 

But an invitation to stay on Fer- 
en brought me direct confrontation 
with my true instincts and we Ay- 
orians returned quickly to planet 
seven where we were received by 
the now better than sixty-thousand 
who were diligently transforming 
their new planet to suit our tastes. 

VI 

\ lready we could roam its sur- 
^ face and breathe oxygen. The 
planet had warmed while dangerous 
gases and chemicals had been trans- 
formed to something more useful 
or stored in mammoth underground 
caverns scooped out by telekmass 
faculties. 

To be truly Enithra-like, it lack- 
ed only the ecology of Enithra — 

IF 




and the beautiful violets and ultra- 
violets of our extensive jungle-cov- 
ered valleys. We covered the planet 
with human bioforms, including the 
clashing greens and browns; for it 
would have been immoral of us to 
introduce a potentially dangerous 
planet in the human’s back-yard. 

“Perhaps we could adjust to the 
greens!” we all sighed. 

We have since learned that un- 
derstanding human motives re- 
quires more than simple naivetd. 
We fully expected the people of 
Feren to regain their political voice, 
and they did. 

But D’Cela, who had not crossed 
my mind since my forcible entry 
into his headquarters, was far more 
dever and subtle than I had imag- 
ined. He was corpulent, selfish, 
evil, frightened and decidedly clev- 
er; and I, Spork, completely over- 
looked the paths he could take, 
given his single-minded motivation. 

Arl, twin of Dingon, had twinned 
in turn long ago. I stayed with 
Arl’s twins on New Enithra — our 
new name for planet seven of the 
Quations galaxy — to watch the 
process of transformation which 
changed it from a harsh, frozen en- 
vironment to one of warmth and 
comfort. Most humans would yet 
find the air too thin and cold but 
with our ability to sort and sur- 
round ourselves with denser, ener- 
gy-packed air molecules we enjoyed 
the planet’s surface at an early per- 
iod. 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



A certain sign that Ayorian evo- 
lutionary progress continued was 
shown by the increasing rate of 
twinning, signifying individual ful- 
fillment by specific Ayorian indi- 
viduals. And each twinned child 
became more skilled at addressing 
the peculiar problems of planet 
tranformation. 

We were now 120,000 in num- 
ber; I was twenty Enithra years 
old, nearly twenty-one. Though I 
almost always stayed on New Eni- 
thra, I did travel from time to time 
to Feren to sit through ceremonial 
dinners where dull speeches filled 
the smokey eating halls. 

And whenever I attended one of 
these special human events in my 
capacity as Honorary Planetary 
President, the luncheons always 
brought to mind the Imply mam- 
mal on my home planet of Enithra. 
Many of our insects and smaller 
mammals can predict the path of 
teleported seed or smaller insect 
and can therefore arrange to be 
within its own striking distance at 
the time of the seed’s or insect’s 
arrival. But the Imply had evolved 
a peculiar oddity. It teleported 
from spot to spot in fairly random 
jumps. Whenever it stopped, it un- 
folded its stomach sack by means 
of fleshy hinges to about seven 
times its original size. If the Imply 
had chosen a sufficiently dense 
population of bugs, chances were 
reasonably good that some insects 
would blindly teleport to the inside 

87 




of this rather cavernous stomach. 

As I listened to human speakers 
and watched their mouths open and 
close mostly in random, meaning- 
less patterns, I often caught my- 
self wondering just when a bug 
would teleport to the inside of the 
big opening! 

I did enjoy my visits with Trod 
Gerard; he was old but lively in 
thought. His knowledge was vast, 
including both human politics and 
galactic history. He had already 
given me the clue which was to 
lead to resolution of my personal 
twinning problem but I was not 
aware of this fact as yet. 

^phough Ayorian divergence by 
^ radial adaptation was an ex- 
cellent means by which a race 
could pass on knowledge from one 
generation to the next — through 
increased capability — it had some 
defects. First, learned knowledge 
was a hidden, intrinsic part of the 
magnetic configuration of an indi- 
vidual Ayorian. Only during the 
time of grouping could all share 
equally in this knowledge. Second, 
an Ayorian like myself, in human 
form, could not share in the group- 
ing; I had constant need for a per- 
sonal search in answer to simple 
technological questions. 

This defect bothered me con- 
stantly and my mind always came 
back to the recorded and written 
records of humans. We Ayorians 
needed objective written records 



too. Then, after we had planted 
many colonies throughout the gal- 
axy, these records could serve as 
quick, accurate means for trans- 
mitting knowledge from colony to 
colony without the necessity for an 
otherwise impossible physical 
vgrouping of billions of Ayorians. 

When I took this problem to the 
children who were most often re- 
ceptive to new ideas and conse- 
quently more inventive, they nat- 
urally made a new game of it. Each 
child had to invent some recording 
device which, when used by an- 
other, had to hold the most infor- 
mation in a form most accurately 
recoverable in the least amount of 
time. Under some rather tough 
measurement criteria, the one who 
could do the most would win the 
game. 

I watched the beginnings of this 
new game. One child teleported 
fragments from a rock, engraving 
his newly invented alphabet on it, 
Another used ideograms. A third 
used binary, then tertiary digits. 
And so all tried something no mat- 
ter how cumbersome or awkward it 
might be. The ideograms won the 
first round. 

The one who had invented the 
alphabet used his same symbols, 
still convinced they were superior; 
but this time he engraved messages 
in microscopic script. He won the 
second round. 

The fourth winner reached be- 
low the molecular level. His was 

IF 



88 




an excellent solution except that 
one Ayorian, namely me, could not 
reach this level; therefore he had 
violated the initial premise that 
ell Ayorians must be capable of 
utilizing the communication device. 

Knowing the game would pre- 
ceed until an eventual satisfactory 
solution to the problem came. I left. 

Life was pastoral for us; all 
thought of D’Cela and his follow- 
ers had left our minds. But had I 
given him further thought, I would 
have acted no differently, such 
was the naivete of my thinking. 

When Erne was killed by the 
Tepen, I was enraged beyond be- 
lief, though no other Ayorians felt 
emotionally disturbed. Now, when 
half our thriving colony on New 
Enithra was wiped out by one mis- 
sile, my rage grew proportionate- 
ly; and this time, though still lack- 
ing emotion of my kind, the sur- 
viving Ayorians recognized this to 
be a true group twinning problem 
and they acted accordingly. 

VII 

■fTTith great dismay we asked our- 
* * selves how such a dangerous 
missile coming from outer space to 
the surface of our planet, sweeping 
through territory well covered by 
every adult’s telekmass sensors, 
could have entered unsensed. Had 
the human race developed. Tepen- 
like telekinetic fields capable of 
blanketing Ayorian faculties? 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



Our questions were analyzed 
swiftly in detail, using both facts 
and logic to give us the answer, or 
probable answer, which also proved 
discomfiting. 

The only direct action instru- 
ment known to humans which also 
involved indirect action phenom- 
enon was the human developed 
hyper-drive. 

D’Cela, the ousted Feren dicta- 
tor, had probably used one of his 
many escape routes to leave Feren, 
once the true revolution had start- 
ed. I had met one military satellite 
on my way to New Enithra from 
Feren and it seemed highly prob- 
able that other ’satellites of the 
same kind, as well as war ships and 
perhaps other Quation system plan- 
ets, would contain men and the 
materials of war which could be 
drawn upon by D’Cela. 

Though very few Ferenians were 
aware of our Ayorian faculties and 
how they had been used in ousting 
D’Cela; D’Cela himself was well 
aware of the effects of indirect phe- 
nomenon. It was not a weak con- 
jecture, then, which forced us to 
decide that at least one of D’Cela’s 
missiles had been modified with 
human type hyper-drives. Further- 
more if our conjecture was cor- 
rect, we could expect others soon. 

The really big question was how 
much warning time might we ex- 
pect between the first appearance 
of the missile from out of hyper- 
drive until it struck our planet. 

89 




Though hesitant to group dur- 
ing a time of emergency — for the 
next missile could easily have killed 
all the remaining Ayor — reaction 
time knowledge was so important 
we accepted the risk. 

My reaction time when employ- 
ing telekmass faculties is about 
one-tenth of a second. My brother’s 
reaction time is about one one- 
hundreth of a second. The missile’s 
reaction time approximated two 
hundredths of a second. Should oth- 
er missiles have similar reaction 
time prior to exploding after re- 
entry to Euclidean space, one 
would imagine that the Ayor could 
easily handle the problem, since 
each adult would have nearly twice 
the required reaction time. 

Not so! 

Full alertness sustained over long 
time periods is probably difficult 
for any biological organism and Ay- 
orians were no exception. 

TI7e could place more Ayorians 
* * on maximal watch, and we 
did. But how many watchers were 
sufficient? What were the resources 
of the enemy — ten missiles per 
minute? Ten missiles per second? 
Ten missiles per nano-second in 
mass saturation drives? 

We could disperse Ayorians 
throughout the planet, and we did. 

Several more missiles struck at 
random intervals. It became a 
nerve-wracking period of spotting 
a suddenly appearing missile, then 



teleporting either it or sensitive 
parts of it away. 

Then our unsensed enemy be- 
came serious; volley after volley 
came in hundreds, sometimes thou- 
sands. Adult Ayorians on watch 
now were fed by Ayorian children 
as the constant need for attention 
and the heavy drains of energy 
through constant use of telekmass 
faculties called upon biological con- 
version of energy in ever-larger 
quantities. 

Since I was the only Ayorian 
whose reaction time was too slow 
for the watch, I gave my time to 
thought on our danger and our new 
fight. And I raged inwardly over 
the death of sixty-thousand of our 
brethren who had died needlessly. 

Wherever our enemy was lo- 
cated, it would be beyond the half- 
million-mile sphere of sensitivity 
given to the adult Ayorian. This 
meant D’Cela must be in satellites, 
spaceships or on other planets or 
combinations of any of the three. 

Feren could be ruled out. So 
could New Enithra. This left plan- 
ets one, three, four, five, six, eight 
and nine. Planets eight and nine 
were inhospitable even to the Ay- 
or, so I ruled out those. Planet one 
could be dropped for the same rea- 
son; and planet five was entirely 
too massive — unless they had 
gravity-controlling equipment un- 
known to us. Hesitant to decide on 
a negative, I kept planet five on 
my list.

IF 




From mental visualization of our 
nine-planet system, since planets 
seven, eight and nine were too hos- 
tile, the defense of the whole plan- 
etary cluster — if that was the 
original purpose — would be pulled 
back just outside of the orbit of 
planet six. 

It seemed reasonable that Fer- 
enian defense planners would have 
wanted as short a supply radius as 
possible, yet would want to include 
all of the more valuable planets. 
They would have been unaware of 
Ayorian capability to transform the 
seventh planet. 

Accordingly there should be sta- 
tions surrounding the orbits of all 
the planets stationed at least as 
far as beyond the orbit of planet 
six. But how many? In what dens- 
ity per unit of time? 

Co far as ships were concerned, 
^ they might be located any- 
where beyond a half-million miles. 
Without data to the contrary, I 
might just as well assume the ex- 
istence of billions of ships merely 
an inch beyond the sensitivity lim- 
its of my brethren, though I knew 
the thought to be foolish. 

So, probably planets three, four, 
five and six were involved; prob- 
ably several thousand satellites 
swung around orbit six and some 
unknown number of ships were 
surrounding us at half a million 
miles or more. 

The large salvos stopped mo- 
SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



mentarily, then began again, and 
the war of nerves continued. 

Once, when we fought the beast 
of planet two in our own system, 
Dingon had carried himself and me 
across millions of miles of space. 
With sufficient nutrients, there 
should be no reason why the 
fact couldn’t be accomplished again 
for the purpose of finding D’Cela’s 
military units and destroying them. 
I estimated that, without my dead 
weight, the adult Ayorian could 
probably carry himself and his nu- 
trients about 67,000,000 miles in 
discrete jumps of half a million 
miles each jump before exhausting 
his nutrients. 

The closest satellite had to be 
orbiting somewhere between fifty 
and sixty million miles outward, if 
not a little closer. Several of the 
adults volunteered, once I explain- 
ed my conjectures and plan. They 
fastened supplies of food to their 
bodies, then attempted their first 
jump, fully realizing that should 
they be unable to find a military 
unit they would starve in space for 
lack of energy-giving nutrients. 

They couldn’t make their first 
jump! 

The whole planet was ringed by 
telekinetic energy fields similar to 
that of the Tepen fields. The Ay-- 
orian, having evolved strictly from 
indirect action beings, had no oth- 
er means of propulsion or motion 
than that of teleportation. They 
could not move a half a millimeter 

91 




without the use of indirect-action 
faculties. 

Now our plight began to look 
very serious. Indeed, I had greatly 
underestimated this D’Cela hu- 
man! 

While all adults remained on 
guard and the children continued 
their feeding duties, I continued 
my thinking efforts. 

D’Cela’s scientists had somehow 
converted hyper-drive phenomenon 
to some kind of telekinetic fence 
around our new planet. But to 
what end? Would it satisfy any 
military establishment of his type 
merely to fence us so that we could 
not get to him or he to us? Event- 
ually the cost in labor and man- 
power required to build and shoot 
his missiles at us would far exceed 
their effect. 

It also occurred to me that he 
might have developed a net which, 
like the Tepen’s, could squeeze 
tighter and tighter until all those 
with only telekinetic capabilities 
lay prostrate. If so, we were in 
very, very serious trouble! 

'T 1 he children checked out my 
conjecture, and it was clearly 
evident that the net was getting 
smaller ! 

I could move through the tele- 
kinetic net as I had once done 
against the Tepen, but how was I 
to gain solid foothold, high over- 
head, enabling my muscles to move 
me through the field? 



Should I teleport to somewhere 
near the field and bring the ship 
there too with the assistance of the 
Ayor? Blasting through the tele- 
kinetic field should be simple, but 
would D’Clela be likely to permit 
such an obvious counter-move? 

Settling on one idea which seem- 
ed promising, we reached through 
the planet’s crust to bedrock, carv- 
ing out a two-mile chunk of irregu- 
larly shaped rock consisting mostly 
of iron and nickel and silicon. 
Within, we hollowed out room for 
myself and one adult Ayorian as 
well as food and water. 

At the risk of allowing one mis- 
sile salvo through, all Ayorians 
grasped the rock containing us, tele- 
porting it nearly five hundred 
thousand miles away from New 
Enithra’s surface, hopefully in the 
direction of the orbiting satellites 
which must ring this system. 

Teleportation does not obey 
what the human community calls 
Newton’s first law of motion. The 
moment we arrived at our prede- 
termined point in space, our ve- 
hicle remained motionless with re- 
spect to a point which could only 
be determined from higher telek* 
mass mathematical calculations. 
The planet of our origin as well as 
the other Quations planetary bod- 
ies and its central nucleus, the sun, 
crept slowly away from us in a pre- 
determined configuration of rela- 
tive motion. 

D’Cela’s telekinetic net was sev- 

IF 



92 




eral thousand miles ahead of our 
point of entry into normal space. 
The relative velocity between our- 
selves and New Enithra was so low 
it soon became apparent that un- 
less we could build up additional 
velocity, our efforts would be too 
late. 

From our deeply buried hiding 
place, I telekinetically shredded 
mass from the front of our vehicle, 
handing them to Eries, my com- 
panion. He slammed them against 
the rear of our rock, causingg its 
velocity to slowly increase. Faster 
and faster we traveled until, by 
drifting with ever-increasing veloc- 
ity, we passed easily through 
D’Cela’s telekinetic net. 

Once beyond the barrier, Eries* 
long-ranging sensitivity was acti- 
vated and we began our first seri- 
ous search for D’Cela’s ships or 
satellites. 

VIII 

Tories jumped thirty-one times 

' before he found the first mil- 
itary satellite. He returned to our 
false meteorite to collect food and 
water and to assist me to the satel- 
lite’s location. 

I swept my mass sensor through 
the five-mile station, finding it 
much like the military fort I had 
encountered and pacified many 
months before. Soldiers were eat- 
ing, sleeping, preparing activated 
missiles, repairing other apparatus, 
SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



drawing charts, preparing reports 
and doing all the other activities 
which accompany military com- 
munities. 

Not wishing to underestimate 
our foe again, we surveyed every 
compartment with microscopic pre- 
cision. One room was devoted to 
maps and charts of the Quations 
system, and it was there I could 
sense several soldiers speaking 
through radio communicators. 

With only my light receptors, I 
could see several small access doors 
open along the side of the giant 
satellite from which several dozens 
of missiles streamed forth, each 
rapidly jumping into hyper-drive 
and disappearing from both sight 
and my mass sensor. 

I disabled the radio first as I had 
once done against the Tepen. Also 
we disarmed all of the missiles and 
destroyed any materials which 
could lend themselves to explosive 
use. 

When we teleported into the 
commander’s quarters, where Eries’ 
transparent body was invisible to 
all but me, I fully expected to in- 
terrogate the commander. But 
D’Cela’s thinking was ahead of me 
again. The commander clamped his 
jaws together, swallowing a fatal 
dose of poison the moment I ap- 
peared! The chemical acted too 
swiftly for me to intervene. 

In the map room I was again too 
late. Standing orders had been 
given which prevented us from 

93 




gaining any usable knowledge. 
D’Cela had proved himself to be a 
clever, forward thinking and dan- 
gerous human beast! 

But he had left one weak link 
in the form of his radio operator, 
a frightened soldier obliged by or- 
der to send a particular coded mes- 
sage every thirty minutes. Though 
he did not know its purpose, Eries 
and I were sure that failure to re- 
ceive his message would signal oth- 
er satellites immediately to send 
missile salvos against this one; 
probably all satellites would be so 
organized. 

His signals were allowed to con- 
tinue while the invisible Eries mon- 
itored the actions of all the men 
and I probed for the most likely 
location of the other satellites. 

Were I to build an economical 
network of military satellites 
around a whole planetary system, 
how far apart would each station 
be placed to insure adequate cov- 
erage with a minimum of overlap? 

'T'he answer would seem to de- 
pend primarily upon the na- 
ture of the weapon which would be 
used, its range and power and the 
time for travel from any station to 
the object to be destroyed ; also the 
percent of desired overlap for the 
sphere of destruction would be im- 
portant, reflecting military over- 
kill features balanced against econ- 
omy. 

Distance between each satellite 



was probably computed from the 
characteristics of unmodified mis- 
sile drive. Estimating our station 
to be at approximately 1.8 X 10 6 
miles from the sun, and assuming 
a sphere of protective covering 3.8 
X 10 13 square miles, and allowing 
for 25% overlap on every side of 
each station, this still meant a pro- 
tective network of 1,000,000 sta- 
tions! 

Accordingly we should expect to 
find our next station somewhere on 
the surface of the protective 
sphere’s boundary in about four 
adult Ayorian jumps of half a mil- 
lion miles each. 

Once these crude estimates had 
been made I was convinced that 
D’Cela, though having made cor- 
rect, shrewd guesses regarding some 
of the characteristics of our telek- 
mass faculties, still had no idea of 
the great jumping range of the 
adult Ayor. 

We easily found the next orbit- 
ing station, where I immediately 
froze its commander’s jaw muscles 
to prevent his suicide; his eyes 
bulged as he tried again and again 
to obey D’Cela’s post-hypnotic 
command. 

In his false tooth I also sensed 
the micron-sized radio transmitter 
which, when the tooth’s cap was 
crushed, also signalled to the map 
room for immediate destruction of 
all the maps. When his poison and 
transmitter were removed, Eries 
kept watch on all other humans

again while I moved into the map 
room. 

To capture the gigantic beast of 
planet two in our own system we 
had placed telekinetic generators 
on each side of the planet, thus in- 
suring that planet two would al- 
ways be embedded in the field. 
Had D’Cela and his human scien- 
tists done the same to us at New 
Enithra? If so, where might the 
field generators be located? 

Obviously every satellite en- 
gaged in directing missiles to New 
Enithra would need to know the 
location and orbiting characteris- 
tics of every other, including those 
which might control our new tele- 
kinetic barriers; I found such maps 
clearly delineating not only the gen- 
erator’s location but also their plan 
of action which called for closing- 
up the net around New Enithra 
within a seven-day period; after 
that, D’Cela hoped to collect noth- 
ing but dead Ayorian bodies from 
the planet’s surface. 

'ITTith some little encouragement 
’ ^ on my part, one of the hu- 
mans removed the explosive head 
from one missile and re-directed it 
to land at the surface of the satel- 
lite containing the telekinetic field 
generator. What he did not know 
was that Eries, invisible to human 
eyes, teleported within the opening 
and rode the missile directly to the 
station, where he easily deactivated 
the generator. 



Space was open again to the Ay- 
ors and we began the long, dirty 
task of disarming 1,000,000 sta- 
tions. By now, D’Cela and his mil- 
itary advisors certainly knew some- 
thing had gone wrong; but they 
couldn’t know the nature of the 
trouble. 

While deactivating these monu- 
ments to evil, I had the additional 
thought that perhaps the satellites 
were only an outer line of defense. 
“Maybe, these humans were care- 
ful enough to build a second line 
somewhat further in,” I thought. 

Additional speculation showed 
the absurdity of the thought. Even 
for the first line, enormous amounts 
of time, sweat and energy had been 
needed to build 1,000,000 satellite 
stations, each nearly five miles in 
diameter by means of direct facul- 
ties only. Either these humans were 
fantastically paranoiac or there was 
even greater danger from outside 
the Ferenian system than I had 
been taught. 

Principles of the modified hy- 
per-drive apparatus showed it to be 
new and novel; left to our own, we 
might not have adapted similar 
principles for many generations. 

We were considerably more in- 
dependent of gravitational effects 
than humans. We could use our in- 
direct faculties to move through the 
gravity-well easily. For this reason, 
I suppose we hadn’t really given 
the phenomenon of gravity the at- 
tention it really deserved. 



SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



95 




D’Cela’s humans, on the other 
hand, fought gravity from the mo- 
ment of their birth. I imagine their 
most brilliant men contemplated it 
and its effects for hundreds of gen- 
erations before they began to learn 
its' control. 

Whatever the case, Eries had 
found D’Cela’s telekinetic field 
generator to be relatively small, not 
much bigger than ten by twelve 
/eet. It tapped the gravity-well of 
the sun. 

D’Cela did not appear with his 
ships during our entire clean-up 
period. No longer underestimating 
him and his scientists, we methodi- 
cally completed our deactivation of 
his military satellites while form- 
ing plans of our own. 

Alert patrols placed around New 
Enithra would prevent recurrence 
of our disaster. The children re- 
turned to their games while some 
of the interested adults began study 
of the D’Cela modified hyper-drive. 
The remainder of us filled our ship 
with supplies for a determined 
search for D’Cela and his men. 

V^vnce I had felt planet five an 
untenable base for human 
habitation because of its steep grav- 
ity-well. Now I wasn’t so sure. If 
humans could tap the sun’s gravity 
well, could they not also tap planet 
five’s, making it habitable? 

Even so, I chose the most ration- 
al course of search. First, at Feren, 
I spoke to all citizens, explaining 
96 



what D’Cela had attempted. Trod 
Gerard introduced us to several 
scientists who agreed to move to 
New Enithra for joint human-Ay- 
orian study. 

Turning then to the problem of 
D’Cela, we found the third planet 
covered with noxious gases. I drop- 
ped the ship into a reddish atmo- 
sphere charged with striking light- 
ning bolts while several of the Ayor 
extended their mass sensors 
throughout the planet’s structure. 

The ground level was smooth. 
Gases surrounding the planet were 
so reactive that its hot flouride rad- 
icals had long ago combined with 
and leveled its surface. Yet, strange 
as it may seem, deep within the 
crevices of ’the planet’s crust could 
be sensed a primitive life which, 
almost as rapidly as our energetic 
Enithra life, was building up com- 
plex plastic-like molecules. They 
captured energy from the furious 
chemical reactions, replicated 
themselves, then grew again. Even 
here was the beginning of life! 

The fourth planet was pitted and 
scarred from billions of years of 
past meteorites. As soon as we were 
within a half million miles of each 
station we knew exactly where its 
military fortresses were located. 

But before any stations could re- 
spond to our presence, we reached 
out to identify and nullify all mis- 
siles. Then we drove in closer as 
though we had no suspicion of the 
station’s presence or the nature of 

IF 




their armanent. When we were 
nearly two hundred miles from the 
planet’s surface, from two separated 
stations came hundreds of missiles, 
making our ship the third apex of 
a triangle. 

We stopped the missiles in mid- 
flight, turned them around and let 
them drop back by gravity pull 
only. Each missile struck with only 
the impact of its kinetic energy, 
some breaking through lighter roof 
structures while others simply 
crushed themselves flat, the pieces 
sliding off harder sloping domes to 
the ground. 

Every other military station was 
treated in similar manner until, fin- 
ally convinced of their futility, 
they flew the white flag of peace. 

D’Cela was not here; he would 
have driven his men to death rather 
than permit surrender even in a 
hopeless cause. 

IX 

*nphe fifth planet was indeed a 
* fortress. Its rotation period 
was ten hours and fifty-seven min- 
utes, but its diameter was 12,000 
miles. Surface velocity was fast and 
its gravity well was steep. Fortun- 
ately, like other planets in this sys- 
tem, it had no moons to complicate 
our search. 

Two military citadels had been 
placed on opposing sides of the 
planet; and overlaying each fort- 
ress was a tightly bound telekine- 

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



tic field which prevented Ayorian 
sensors from reaching through. 

Aided by optical instruments, I 
was able to make use of my nor- 
mally useless light receptors to find 
that their construction was similar 
to D’Cela’s headquarters back on 
dense metal surrounding raging 
atomic fires, all bolted to planet’s 
bed-rock. 

I could move myself through the 
telekinetic barrier, but obviously 
wouldn’t be allowed to come so 
close. I further doubted my ability 
to react as fast as his missiles. 

Easily fending off droves of mis- 
siles, we moved closer to his main 
station, probing it with our own ex- 
plosive forces. Not since my cap- 
ture of the Tepen had I witnessed 
the effects of a physical object bar- 
rier. Our missiles could easily have 
passed through protective tele- 
kinetic barriers but they splashed 
themselves to death against 
the physical object barrier, ex- 
ploding prematurely as they hit the 
newer force field surrounding the 
station in near hemispherical per- 
fection. 

D’Cela’s station was protected 
by the ultimate defense — telekin- 
etis and direct-action barriers. We 
couldn’t touch him and he couldn’t 
get at us. 

How did he move his missile 
through his doubly protected net- 
work? 

My light receptors could not re- 
spond quickly enough to view pos- 

97 




sible switching of double fields and 
our telekmass sensors could view 
nothing at all. 

Did D’Cela turn off the physi- 
cal energy barrier long enough to 
permit hundreds of missiles through 
during each salvo? If so, we should 
be able to take advantage of the 
time aperture no matter how small 
it might be. 

There was a way to test our con- 
jecture! 

Several of our own missiles were 
moved to the planet’s surface at its 
junction with the physical object 
barrier. They lay about five miles 
from the edge of the fortress, on a 
slightly inclined plane, each point- 
ing toward the fortress. 

A small telekinetic force against 
the missile’s rear-most edge kept 
their noses pressed against the 
physical object barrier; should this 
barrier open, even momentarily, the 
missile would be inside and we 
would have our knowledge. 

To divert attention, we cast more 
missiles directly at the fortress. 
Their answering missiles appeared 
at once. Our missiles at the bar- 
rier’s base tore inward to explode 
in gigantic bursts against the hy- 
pothesized second barrier at about 
three miles from the citadel. 

D’Cela had two physical object 
barriers placed around his fort, 
synchronized so that at no time 
would we gain access to him. When 
his missiles flew to the first, he re- 
leased that barrier, replacing it be*

N ews from New Enithra ar- 
rived. Ten new twinnings had 
occurred while solving the puzzles 
presented by the gravity-generator. 
Otherwise all was tranquil at home. 

Oh how I longed for the peace- 
ful Enithra days where life moved 
simply from puzzle to puzzle, rath- 
er than from death to death! My 
mind just naturally called up the 
beautiful violets and ultraviolets of 
Enithra and its many interesting, 
friendly-seeming life forms, like the 
delicate puff-ball which floated eas- 
ily through the atmosphere, reach- 
ing its tiny mass-sensor outward to 
identify and to teleport dust motes 
and light energy packets to its top 
nodule. 

I remembered that some of these 
would glow like little lanterns or 
stars in the sky while others would 
float in darkness, resting. When the 
sky filled with sweet smelling rain 
— and if the rain were thick 
enough — the puff-ball often was 
pushed to the ground, where un- 
luckily it drowned in larger pools 
of water. Unhappily I thought, 
“What we need is a heavy rain to 
pour on D’Cela’s fortsl” 

Such speculative withdrawals 
from life’s real problems seemed 
remote from the issues, but I had 
always found them useful and this

An Interview 
with 

Robert Bloch 




Bob Bloch is best known to That 
Big World Outside as thei author of 
the crawly Hitchcock movie, Psy- 
cho; but science fiction knows him 
as the author of science-fiction and 
fantasy stories beyond counting , 
and perhaps most affectionately as 
the man who writes most of the SF 
Convention reports for If. Turn 
about , they say y is fair play. At 
the Rio de Janeiro Film Festival 
and Science-fiction Symposium in 
March , we lured Bob up to the bal- 
cony of our hotel room , turned on 
the tape recorder and started him 
talking . This is what came out. 

I first got involved as a science- 
fiction reader in 1928, with David 
H. Keller’s story, The Revolt of 
the Pedestrians . That hooted me on 
reading the stuff. I went through 
the usual stages — Jules Verne, H. 
G. Wells and the current sf maga- 
zines, of course. I became socially 
involved in 1935. 



Pd jusl sold my first few stories 
to Weird Tales, and I was invited 
to become g member of the Mil- 
fraugag Fictioneers. This was a 
professional writers’ group which 
met every two weeks for purely 
professional purposes; that is to 
say, there were only working writers 
for members. We spent our time 
plotting stories and assisting vari- 
ous members with hangups. The 
reason I say it was a professional 
group was that we had no lady po- 
etesses, no one was allowed to read 
from manuscripts and no alcohol 
was consumed during meetings. I 
don’t know how many hundreds of 
stories came out of the Milwaukee 
Fictioneers during those pulp years, 
but I do know that this was where 
I first met real live sf writers. 

At that time our group included 
several men who sold occasional 
science-fiction stories, plus such 
pros as Roger Sherman Hoare (al- 
so known as Ralph Milne Farley), 



99 




Kaymona a. Calmer ana Stanley U. 
Wembaam. Stanley in particular 
impressed me. He was a very soft- 
spoken former resident of Louis- 
ville, Kentucky, with a very fine 
literary background. Oddly enough, 
although he was then doing spec- 
tacularly well in science fiction, his 
great ambition was to write for 
Weird Tales . We spent a great deal 
of time together, aside from the 
contacts at meetings, discussing the 
elements of fantasy and just how 
these could be translated into sci- 
ence-fiction terms, that is to say 
in reference to the science fiction 
of 1935. Both of us were hooked 
on James Branch Cabell and carried 
a 40-pound Silver Stallion on our 
backs. So while I tried to indoc- 
trinate Weinbaum regarding fan- 
tasy, he in turn gave me an or- 
ientation to science fiction. 

This may be a little presumptuous. 
I was IS, and he was an old man 
of 35. But I made a very pleasant 
corollary discovery, viz, that in the 
scienao4iction world time is indeed 
relative, and a teenager can explore 
the same dimension as a mature 
adult, and meet on the same level. 

Again it was the Milwaukee Fic- 
tioneers that indirectly brought me 
to the actual writing of science 
fiction when RAP took over Amaz- 
ing and Fantastic Adventures . He 
called upon the Fictioneers for con- 
tributions, and I wrote my first 
story for him. It was called The 
Secret in the Observatory. The real 
100 



secret, ot course, was now it ever 
managed to get published. 

During World War II my in- 
terests in sf fandom grew, and with 
it my desire to write farther in the 
field. Fd say that the majority 
of the sf I wrote then, and of what 
I write now, consists of borderline 
fantasy. My interest in hard science 
is somewhat limited by my com- 
plete inability to understand the 
workings of any mechanical gad- 
get more complicated than an elec- 
tric toothbrush. However, my in- 
terest in the field of imaginative 
speculation is extremely intense. 

As a writer, IVe always consid- 
ered myself to be primarily a per- 
former. I look upon my work as an 
effort at entertainment, and my 
readers, if any, as an audience. This 
attitude had its roots in my early 
childhood. My mother had been a 
social worker in order to support 
her family, but in so doing had 
given up a career as a singer; she’d 
once been offered an opportunity 
to enter what was then called light 
opera and operetta work by Flor- 
enz Ziegfield’s father. He was the 
head of the Chicago Academy of 
Music, and a very influential fig- 
ure in the 1890’s; that’s where Flo 
got his start. My mother gave up 
her musical career, but she never 
abandoned her interest in the thea- 
ter. As a child in Chicago, we at- 
tended regularly. I was more im- 
pressed, however, by the vaudeville 
shows which my father introduced 

IF 




me to. By the time I entered high 
school I was stagestruck. 

During those depression years I 
appeared regularly in dramatic pro- 
ductions. I wrote and performed in 
my own skits and sketches, and 
rather fancied myself as a comedian. 
As I look back on it now, my pre- 
tensions were funnier than I was. 
But I did succeed, around 1936, in 
selling a few gags to radio comedi- 
ans Stoopnagle and Budd, and to 
Roy Atwell who at that time was 
working with Fred Allen. I also 
made a few appearances as a mas- 
ter of ceremonies at the kind of 
night spot later celebrated by John 
O’Hara in Pal Joey . For three shows 
a night the performer received ten 
dollars, a sandwich and a cup of 
coffee. The agent took $5, but he 
got no sandwich. I had a particular 
advantage in that my agent could 
not drink coffee. But, somehow, 
it wasn’t enough to compensate for 
the long hours and the long lay- 
offs during those depression years. 

Abandoning my dreams of glory 
of becoming a top banana in the 
burlesque wheel, I resigned myself 
to a fullfledged career as a writer. 

Unfortunately, for many years 
the best I could attain was a half- 
fledged career. There were not 
enough markets for fantasy, and 



very few outlets for my dubious 
brand of science fiction. 

It must be difficult for today’s 
readers to realize that at the time 
of which I speak there were only 
three hard-cover anthologies of fan- 
tasy fiction in existence, with the 
exception of an English reprint se- 
ries which had borrowed heavily 
from Weird Tales . There were no 
science-fiction anthologies whatev- 
er. There were no paperback re- 
prints, nor, of course, any paper- 
back originals. The situation was 
far different from that which exists 
today. 

Even by the depression stan- 
dards of income, it was virtually 
impossible for a fulltime writer to 
earn even a meager living, unless 
he also turned out detective stories, 
Westerns, love stories and true 
confessions. Many of my colleagues 
augmented their income by writing 
for the comic books. So my little 
entertaining was performed on a 
very small stage. 

The economics of science fiction 
have improved: the status of sci- 
ence fiction has grown; the audi- 
ence for science fiction has become 
greatly enlarged. The techniques of 
writers have advanced. But, to me, 
science fiction ideally remains en- 
tertainment.

THE 

HALF MAH 

by KEITH LAUMER 



Illustrated by BARR 



Gon was a creafure without a 
world , sent to bring destiny 
to those who refused it. But 
sometimes destiny takes over . 



4CTT7liy don’t you give it up?” 
^ * Cruthers said. The chief of 
the Planetary Resource Survey 
team was a lean, gray-faced, gray- 



haired man with the fussy, precise 
manner of a bookkeeper. He ad- 
dressed his question to a tall, red- 
faced, middle-aged man in field 
khakis, and to the boy who sat on 
the bench beside him adjusting the 



102 





straps that held the flat com- 
pressed-air tanks to his back. The 
lad was sturdily built, though odd- 
ly proportioned; his arms were 
thick and long, his torso short. 
Tough membranes linked his pow- 
erful fingers. His body, clad only 
in diving trunks, was hairless, the 
skin a blotchy greenish color, coarse 
and leathery. His eyes were large 
and round, his nose almost non- 
existent, his mouth small, pursed. 
He looked too alien to be fully hu- 
man, too human to be other than a 
man. 

“We’ve come too far to be beat- 
en now, Mr. Cruthers,” the blond 
man said heartily, resting a hand 
on the boy’s shoulder. “Gon and I 
will carry on so long as the Infinite 
gives us the strength.” 

“Mostly the boy’s strength,” 
Cruthers said shortly, eyeing Gon 
sourly. “This can’t go on indefinite- 
ly, Brother Glad.” He looked the 
big, florid man in the eye. “I have 
the authority to order an end to 
these swimming expeditions on 
medical grounds. He’s exhausting 
himself for nothing. It’s obvious 
there’s no viable culture among the 
natives — assuming any are left 
alive.” 

“We know they’re alive. And as 
for culture, it’s not their fault Ter- 
ra withdrew support, let them re- 
vert to savagery,” Brother Glad 
said in his large voice. “These peo- 
ple are a human creation, no less 
human for their appearance. It 



was Terran science that mutated 
their ancestors, disinherited them 
and denied them the open air. We 
can’t slough off responsibility for 
them!” 

“That was three hundred years 
ago. My job isn’t to emotionalize 
over what’s past, but to look for 
ways to build the future. Recom- 
mending uneconomic ventures on 
lifeless worlds isn’t one of those 
ways.” 

“We must stay long enough to 
establish contact and learn their 
needs!” the missionary said indig- 
nantly. “We owe it to the Merieds 
to do what we can to lighten their 
lot.” 

“The Meried experiment was 
carried out in order to open a new 
world to colonization, to afford an 
outlet for the human need for a 
frontier. The test failed. I shall so 
report.” 

“But we could try again — ” 

“I can’t base my recommenda- 
tions on sentiment, Brother Glad, 
however noble. Tomorrow we lift. 
You may plan accordingly.” The 
Survey chief turned and strode 
from the room. 

“Don’t despair, Gon,” Glad said 
to the boy after the door had 
closed. “I’m sure we’ll have luck 
today. Think what it will mean, 
Gon — to meet your own peo- 
ple — ” 

“They’re not my people,” the 
boy interrupted. He looked at the 
stone floor, not at the man. “They 



THE HALF MAN

look like . like freaks,” he added 
in a mutter. 

“We don’t use that word, Gon!” 
the man said in a whiplash tone. 
“You, least of all!” 

A beige flush mounted the boy’s 
narrow face. 

“I’m worse than they are,” he 
blurted. “They’re at home here, 
but I’m not at home anywhere! I 
can’t stand sunlight, but I can’t 
breathe water! I swim better than 
any Terran, but not as well as a 
baby Meried!” 

“There’ll always be a home for 
you in the Tabernacle,” the mis- 
sionary said in a gentler voice. 
“Now come along. It’s time.” 

Gon didn’t move. 

“Gon, Gon, have you forgotten 
every thing we’ve taught you?” the 
blond man said in a tone of pa- 
tience long abused. “Don’t you re- 
member our purpose here, your 
own privileged role as a unique in- 
strument of the Infinite?” 

“I’m not a unique instrument, 
Brother Glad. I’m a halfbreed mon- 
ster that never should have been 
bontl” 

“Stop it!” The missionary’s voice 
cracked like a physical blow. 
“You’re forbidden, ever, to voice 
thoughts like those! There is a 
purpose in life for every soul born 
under a sun! Your purpose is here! 
Now get on your feet and come 
with mel I won’t let you fail — us 
or yourself!” 



Reluctantly, the boy rose and 
followed the blond man as he 
strode down across the pebbled 
beach. At the edge of the sea, the 
older man halted and turned his 
face up to the sky. 

“O, thou who art eternal and 
without limit,” he intoned, “grant 
this humble creature of thy mak- 
ing the privilege of leading those 
who were lost and are found again 
back to the true path of thy wifll” 
He turned to the boy. 

“Perhaps today is the day, Gon,” 
he said solemnly. “Good luck.” 
The boy shivered, looking out 
across the wind-riffled water. He 
went forward hesitantly until an 
edge of surf washed about his feet, 
then paused to adjust the breath- 
ing mask across his mouth. As he 
looked back, he saw Brother Glad’s 
pale eyes fixed on him. He waded 
on; the chill water surged about 
his waist, his chest. 

I'm afraid l he wanted to scream. 
7 don't want to go down into this 
alien ocean . I want to go home. 
But instead he drew a deep breath 
and dived forward into the break- 
ing wave.

O n their barge, anchored ten 
miles off the lifeless North 
Continent of the world known as 
Meries, Cap O’Royle and Pard 
Kuchel, traders, sat at the cabin 
table, drinking coffee. For the last

IF 




five hours they had been busy, 
loading the displays of Terran man- 
ufactured goods into the home- 
made display racks designed to be 
lowered over the side for the ex- 
amination of their prospective cus- 
tomers. Small tools, wrist compas- 
ses, patent fish-baits, sea-lights, 
buckles and straps, small hardware, 
a few foodstuffs; all the items that 
twenty years of tramp commerce 
had taught them would be wel- 
comed by the elusive Merieds. 

There was a sudden splash in 
the diving well at the center of the 
barge; a goggle-eyed gray-blue face 
appeared there, water sluicing down 
across the coarse, almost reptilian 
skin. The creature’s sphincter-like 
mouth gaped comically, like a gold- 
fish on a carpet. Water ran 
from the nostrils, mere slits in the 
wet-clay sheen of the face. The sea- 
man made a hoarse, croaking 
sound, waved a webbed hand and 
dropped from sight as O’Royle, a 
stodty, white-haired man, called a 
greeting. 

“They’re here,” he said, rising. 
“I’ll take the first load down.” 

“Damn! Wish old Dreen would 
give a man more warning! Many 
times as I’ve seen that ugly face, 
it still gives me the leaping creeps 
when it pops up at me that way!” 

“They’re adapted to their envi- 
ronment, Pard, like a bird or a fish. 
Think of ’em that way and they 
have a kind of beauty.” 

“Hard to believe they’re only 



ten generations away from normal 
folk,” Pard said. “I heard some- 
where a man could still breed with 
’em. Picture getting that close to 
one of their females.” 

O’Royle grunted. He checked 
his gauges, closed his helmet and 
lowered himself into the well. As 
the blue-green water closed over 
him, the sea-man swam up, his 
oversized eyes gleaming in the wa- 
tery light. 

“Hello, Dreen,” O’Royle said, 
his voice echoing oddly through 
his underwater microphone. “Good 
trip up?” 

The Meried’s finny head- 
crest rippled as he nodded, utter- 
ing the gasping, clucking sound 
that was an all-purpose affirmative. 
He held out a small pouch of soft, 
slick-wet fishskin. 

“I have a few sea-stones for you, 
O’Royle,” he said in his thin, go- 
ing - down - for - the - last - time 
voice. “Not so nice as last time, 
but big, eh?” 

The trader squeezed the pearls 
out on his palm. They were as big 
as walnuts, but lumpy, an irides- 
cent milky-blue yellow in color. 

“They’re beauties,” O’Royle 
said. He waved a hand at his stock 
of goods — mostly small hardware, 
water-proof power tools. “Take 
what you like.” 

nphe Meried took his time look- 
*■* ing over the display. Other 
sea-men gathered around. They had 



THE HALF MAN 



105 




brought their barter-goods with 
them: nets of rare shells, glassy, 
polychrome corals, sea fruits mu- 
tated from Earthly plants. There 
were swollen ears of sea-corn with 
yard-long cobs set with fist-sized 
kernels, purple oceanberries de- 
scended from Pinot Noir grapes, 
clusters of tomatoids, like great 
green raspberries; hundred-foot 
salt-melons which would be flensed 
like whales and the sweet red flesh 
lifted aboard in hundred-pound 
slabs, to be ferried ashore and 
stored in the spaceship’s freezer. 
The stones O’Royle sold on dis- 
tant planets, but the foodstuffs he 
rationed out to himself and Pard 
over the long years between visits. 

“Did you know, O’Royle, there 
is another party of drymen camped 
on the shore there, half a swim to 
the north?” the sea-man said. He 
pointed off through the murky wa- 
ter. 

“Traders?” O’Royle frowned. 

“These are no traders. They 
built a house on the high beach, 
but they offer no goods.” 

“Maybe they’re scientists, a 
mapping party, something like 
that.” O’Royle rubbed his chin, 
looking troubled. 

“They say,” Dreen went on, 
“that there’s a man among them 
who’s of the sea, but not of the 
sea.” 

O’Royle looked at him questiott- 
ingly. “You mean a frogman, with 
scuba gear?” 



“No ... he swims naked in the 
surf. Yet he sleeps on land. Curi- 
ous, eh, Royle?” 

“Half a swim to the north, you 
said?” 

Back on deck, O’Royle told Pard 
the news. The smaller man swore. 

“Might of known it wouldn’t 
last, having the place to ourselves.” 
“There’s plenty here for every- 
one, Pard,” his partner pointed 
out. “It might be the best thing 
for the Merieds to build up trade 
here, remind the government 
they’re out here.” 

“I don’t mean that. I just don’t 
want strangers poking in, spoiling 
things. I like it like it is — peace- 
ful.” 

“We don’t own Meried, Pard. 
But I’m curious. I’m going to take 
the flitter over and pay a courtesy 
call. You mind the store.” 

m 

A s Gon’s eyes adapted to the 
light level, he was able to see 
the undulating slope that stretched 
away before him, its sin face thick- 
ly grown with weed of the strange 
color that he only saw here, under 
the sea. A cloud of silt rose like a 
puff of smoke ahead, as some small 
sea-dweller took alarm at his ap- 
proach; at once, with a sharp pain, 
the nictitating membranes that pro- 
tected his eyes flicked closed — a 
reflex never triggered on land. 

He swam on, out past the second 

IF 



106 




bar, angling more sharply down- 
ward now. Outcroppings of rock 
broke the bottom here; the lumin- 
ous lichens crusting them shed an 
eerie glow through the water. Small 
shrimp-like piscoids moved in awk- 
ward sp urts among the stalks of 
sea-cane. Something large and lazy 
oozed away across the bottom. Gon 
drew air from his breather, giving 
the big fellow a wide berth. 

The first chill had passed; as his 
body warmed, he swam more strong- 
ly, questing through the dim water 
for the elusive mermen. 

O’Royle flew north for half an 
hour, following the barren coast- 
line of the lifeless continent. Be- 
hind the froth-laced beach, gray 
and tan hills rose toward distant 
peaks of stone, untouched by the 
faintest hint of green. Only patches 
of dead trees and sere grasses along 
the strand attested the three-cen- 
turies-gone attempt to transplant 
earthly soil and flora to the young 
world. Those, and the remnant of 
the viaformed humans who had 
been seeded here. The Lost War 
had wrecked the grand scheme of 
which they had been a part, cut off 
the support and aid that would 
have made the scheme work. Now 
with a resurgent Terra again feel- 
ing her way into the Arm, the Mer- 
ieds might benefit from some be- 
lated assistance, O’Royle reflected. 
But, more likely, the sea-men 
would suffer from the rediscovery 
of their world. The oceans were 



rich in dissolved minerals; floating 
refineries could extract them, dis- 
charge the contaminating wastes in- 
to the sea. It was standard practice 
on pre-life worlds, but tough on the 
Merieds. That was the reason 
O’Royle had never reported his 
find, twenty-five years ago. Now, it 
seemed, the secret was out. 

He saw the camp ahead, a clus- 
ter of pre-fab sheds perched on a 
knoll of rock above high-tide line. 
He settled in near a shed; a stocky 
man in khakis came forward. 

“I’m Brother Glad,” the stranger 
said, holding out a square hand. 
“Surprised to see your flier. The 
others are away, out in the launch.” 

O’Royle listened silently to the 
other’s explanation of the purpose 
of the Survey Group. 

“I understand you have a half- 
breed in your party,” he said when 
the missionary paused. “I’d like to 
see him.” 

Brother Glad looked surprised. 
“There is a lad of mixed blood with 
me, yes. How did you — ” 

“Where is he?” 

“What’s your reason for ask- 
ing?” 

“This boy — he’s from Terra? 
About nineteen years old?” 

Glad frowned. “And if he is?” 

“His name’s Gon O’Royle. He’s 
my son.” 

Glad’s face went rubbery; his 
mouth shaped itself around words 
as if trying them for size but find- 
ing none that fit. 



THE HALF MAN 



107 




“I left the boy in school, back on 
Terra,” O’Royle said. “Why did 
you bring him here?” 

T>rother Glad made an effort to 
^ reassemble his expression of 
stern good will. “He belongs here,” 
he stated. “His destiny — ” 

“He belongs back on Terra, get- 
ting an education,” O’Royle cut off 
the other’s speech. 

Brother Glad’s expression jelled 
over. “Gon is here doing what the 
Infinite shaped him for, what he 
was born for.” 

O’Royle narrowed his eyes. “He 
was born,” he said grimly, “be- 
cause a young spacer met a woman 
in a lonely place, and they fell in 
love. As for his shape — Gon’s an 
intelligent boy, a fine scholar. He 
can lead a useful life — ” 

“A life of seclusion — a scien- 
tist-monk, a misfit in a dead-end! 
He deserves a chance to live! Here, 
he can make a unique contribution. 
He’ll play a role in the Great 
Plan — ” 

“Hogwash!” O’Royle cut in. 
“You’re not going to use Gon as 
a pawn in your game, whatever it 
is! Now, do you tell me where he 
is, or do I have to start looking?” 
Brother Glad met O’Royle’s eye. 
“You may be Gon’s father, but he’s 
of age. You’ve no claim on him 
now.” 

“And you do?” 

“He’s helping me willingly.” 

“To do what?” 



“His people were disinherited — 
denied the open land, the free air 

— by the meddling of our ances- 
tors! I intend to undo that wrong 

— to bring these unfortunate step- 
children of the human race back 
to their own world! Gon can help!” 

/^v’Royle stared at the zealot. 

“Back to their own world? 
This is their world, damn you! 
They can’t live out of water for 
more than a few hours!” 

“Perhaps — but we needn’t 
abandon them to such a fate! 
They’ve regressed since their an- 
cestors were left here; they no 
longer farm; their domestic ani- 
mals have returned to the wild. 
They’ve multiplied, but no start 
has been made on bringing life to 
the shore. The experiment, in other 
words, is a failure. Very well — 
these people are doomed — but 
their children deserve the right to 
rejoin their race, to live normal 
lives! They’re innocent victims of 
unnatural tampering with the In- 
finite’s plan! We owe it to them to 
give them back what they lost!” 
“Where does Gon come into all 
this?” 

“He’s my ambassador to the 
Merieds. He’ll go among them, 
bring the good news of their de- 
liverance to them, lay the founda- 
tion for the program — ” 

“You sent him out there — into 
the ocean?” 

“Of course. It’s his natural ele- 

IF 



108 




men t. He can go among the Merieds 
as no norm — ordinary man could 
do.” 

“You fool I” O’Royle’s voice was 
ragged. “Why do you think I took 
him to Terra in the first place?” 
“To be rid of him, I suppose!” 
O’Royle’s fists were clenched, 
but he held his voice steady. “Gon 
looks like his mother — externally. 
To normal Terries that makes him 
a freak, a side-show exhibit. But in- 
ternally, it’s different. He’s only 
half Meried. His heart’s not de- 
signed to pump under the pressure 
of more than fifty or a hundred feet 
of water. And the trace minerals in 
the water here are wrong; iodine 
and arsenic and lead can reach tox- 
ic levels in his cells in a matter of 
hours — if he hasn’t drowned by 
then, or been killed by the local 
sea-life I” 

“Wh — why, Gon’s been swim- 
ming every day since we arrived; 
he’s suffered no ill effects — ” 
“He’s been lucky.” 

“The locals seem safe enough!” 
Brother Glad snapped. 

“They’re used to it,” O’Royle 
came back. “Gon isn’t. He’s led a 
sheltered life until now. How long 
has he been gone?” 

“Perhaps an hour, a little more. 
But, look here — ” 

“Did he have a set course, any 
communication link?” 

“No set course ... he was to 
swim out a few miles, then cast 
about. I’m not in direct communi- 

110 



cation with him at all — ” 
“I’m going after him with scuba 
gear,” O’Royle snapped. “Do you 
have a flitter you can take out to 
search the surface with?” 

“No — nothing ” 

“Then stand by on shore, in 
case he makes it back here.” 
O’Royle turned to the door, giving 
the missionary a hard look. “If Gon 
dies,” he said, “I’ll be back to see 
you.” 

IV 

G on saw the Meried at a depth 
of forty feet, two miles off- 
shore. It was a slim female who ap- 
peared before him out of the dark- 
ness, her body glowing faintly to 
Gon’s sea-eyes, slightly magnified 
by the lens effect of the watery 
medium. Gon halted, staring into 
the grotesque mask that peered 
wide-eyed at him. Then the sea- 
girl’s small mouth opened, emitted 
rasping speech resembling the 
squeaks and chirps of dolphin-talk. 
For a moment the young halfbreed 
was baffled; then he caught the 
rhythm of the Meried speech, 
which he had heretofore heard on- 
ly on tapes in a sunny classroom 
on Terra. 

“You’re the half-man; I’ve seen 
you playing in the surf.” 

“I . I’m Gon O’Royle,” the 
boy said. His voice, coming through 
the specially designed speaking 
mask that covered his mouth and 

IF 




nostrils, echoed and grated in his 
ears. The rehearsed speech he had 
memorized against this moment 
froze on his lips as the Meried 
swam closer, moving herself effort- 
lessly with small flutterings of her 
fingers and toes, turning to look at 
Gon from all sides as she circled 
him, carrying a light spear gun in 
her hand. 

“You are like a sea-man and yet 
. not like,” the stranger said. 
“What is that you hold in your 
teeth?" 

“I have to have it — to breathe,” 
Gon said. 

“Indeed? Still, you swim well — 
for a dryman.” 

“I’m no dryman!” Gon blurted, 
and paused, experiencing for the 
first time in his life a sense of 
shame at his land-dweller traits. 

“You’re far afield,” the Meried 
said. “We seldom swim these wa- 
ters, The grampus lairs here. I 
came searching for a strayed swoat, 
never thinking to find a half-man 
instead!” The sea-girl’s mouth 
puckered into an expression Gon 
recognized as a smile. 

“I want to talk to you,” Gon 
said hurriedly. “I have news for 
you — wonderful news. You 
haven’t been forgotten — ” 

“I must go. Will you come with 
me?” the stranger cut in. “Many 
will want to see you, to welcome 
you. We hoped you’d venture out 
to us in time.” 

“You’ve been . watching me?” 



“We’re curious folk. We welcome 
any diversion.” 

Gon hesitated, remembering 
Brother Glad’s instructions: to de- 
liver his speech, arrange a second 
meeting, then return. But it had 
been so long with no results. What 
if this creature swam off and never 
came back? He owed it to Brother 
Glad to cement relations now, while 
he had the chance .... 

“Yes, I’d... I’d like to come.” 
The Meried flashed her strange 
smile again, turned with the flexi- 
ble grace of an eel and was gone 
into the murk. Gon paddled hur- 
riedly after her. Half a minute la- 
ter the Meried reappeared. 

“You must learn to use your 
strength in the water,” she said. 
“Not to waste it in floundering.” 
Swimming slightly ahead, she 
led the newcomer out across the 
edge of the continental shelf and 
down toward the lightless Deeps of 
the Continental Sea. 

U sing the wet-jet strapped to 
his back, and following the 
beam of his sea-light, O’Royle cov- 
ered three miles in a quarter of an 
hour, alert for a signal from the 
locator on his wrist, set to resonate 
to a moving body of the mass of a 
man. 

Twice he picked up traces that 
led him into detours; the first 
time a great mollusk scuttled away 
at his approach; the second, a wild 
sea-dog approached, fangs bared in

its seal-like snout. He drove it off 
with a beam of sound from his 
’caster. He could have killed it as 
easily, but the scent of ma mmali an 
blood would have attracted a pack 
of its fellows. The Terran trans- 
plants had thrived on native fare, 
multiplied hugely in their adopted 
home; but their taste for red meat 
clung in instinct, even after three 
hundred years of sea-life. 

Now the offspring of strays and 
runaways had claimed huge vol- 
umes of the sea as their own, in 
competition with their former mas- 
ters. 

O’Royle pictured Gon, alone and 
helpless, surrounded by sea-carni- 
vores with the smell of Terran 
blood in their nostrils. Grimly, he 
swam on. 

It had been a long time since he 
had cruised here, in the purple- 
black waters of Meries. Not since 
Gon’s birth, in fact, and the death 
of Onide, his mother. 

And now — so close to the day 
.when Gon would have been gradu- 
ated, able to take a post with the 
University Foundation — a med- 
dling fanatic had come along to de- 
stroy the whole careful structure 
built up over two decades of hard 
labor. 

O’Royle switched trains of 
thought again, concentrated on his 
compass readings, heading outward 
toward the sea-dty where he had 
met and wooed a sea-woman once, 
long ago. 



/^lose behind his guide, Gon 
^ threaded his way down, 
down, toward a faint, water-dif- 
fused glow spreading out below. 
Dark spires of rock swept past to 
left and right; the Meried woman 
turned and twisted, rounding crag- 
gy, weed-grown buttes, sailing un- 
der fragilely balanced arches, 
plunging downward at last into a 
near-vertical cavern mouth to 
emerge in an amphitheatre of ter- 
raced stone asparkle with pastel 
glows. Only then did Gon realize 
that he was in the ruins of one of 
the undersea cities built three cen- 
turies before for the sea colony. 

Suddenly, Meried faces were all 
about. A cacophony of alien voices 
called greeting, asked questions, 
made observations. 

“Back so soon, Seryl? And who’s 
this with you?” 

“Mama — why is he a funny 
color?” 

“Hello, young one. What’s that 
across your mouth?” 

“Does he really sleep on the 
rocks?” 

A large, scar-faced sea-man with 
a tattered crest was before Gon, 
looking at him with eyes that seem- 
ed covered with a grayish film. 
“Who are you?” he demanded 
plaintively. “What are you?” 

“I’m Gon O’Royle,” he said, and 
again his prepared speech deserted 
him. “I want to be your friend,” 
he stammered. 

“I remember,” the old man said.

“Onide. She bore a son to the dry- 
man. He took the infant away.” 

“Yes — you must be the son of 
Onidel” a woman said. “How like 
her he is — and yet how strange 
he is.” 

“So, so. Strange things happen 
as the world grows old.” The aged 
Meried drifted away. Gon looked 
around bewildered at the slim, 
swift shapes gliding in and out of 
the rounded doorways — or were 
they windows? — that reminded 
him of the toy castles in fishbowls 
— and of sunken ships, drowned 
sailors. Abruptly, the sea seemed to 
close in on him. He sucked air 
frantically through the mouthpiece, 
feeling terror rise in him. He struck 
out In what he thought was the di- 
rection of the passage through 
which he had entered, but found 
only a slimy barrier of volcanic 
stone. Seryl called, but he pushed 
frantically on, hearing a shrilling in 
his head, the thud of his heart, 
banging his head, bruising his 
hands as he scraped and fumbled, 
forcing his way through narrow 
passages that opened only into oth- 
er pockets, ending in a dark cul de 
sac. He tried to orient himself, but 
the infallible sense that had always 
before told him in which direction 
to move seemed numbed, ampu- 
tated. Even the phosphorescence 
was gone from the water. For an 
instant he thought that he was 
blind; then he caught the infinite- 
ly faint glow of his own skin. 



“Seryl 1” he shouted, and almost 
lost the breather, choking as a jet 
of water sprayed past the mouth- 
piece. He doubled up in a parox- 
ysm of coughing. He recovered — 
weak trembling, with a pounding 
pain in his head — to find himself 
in total darkness and total silence 
— alone and utterly lost. 

V 

Tnside O’Royle’s scuba suit the 
pressure and the cold were as 
oppressive as a filled grave. He 
wasn’t as young as he had been 
when he had first swum here — not 
by a lifetime. He realized quite 
suddenly that he might fail, might 
not find Gon might not even 
find the sea-city of the Merieds. 

But he had to find it. He knew 
its location; his compass would 
lead him there. And there he’d find 
his old friends and tell them what 
had happened, enlist their help 

He swam on, tiring, but driven 
by the mental image of Gon, alone 
and in danger, needing him. He 
was taken by surprise by the trio 
of sea-men that were suddenly 
around him. 

“Benoroyle!” a familiar voice 
came scratchily through his helmet. 
“Is it you indeed?” 

“Dreen — thank God you’re 
here I It’s my son — the half-man 
you told me about. I’ve got to find 
him!” 

The sea-men conferred. “The lad

visited City,” another Meried said. 
“But we sensed he was discomfited. 
So we left him alone, until he 
should feel more at ease. He soon 
departed, perhaps to meditate in 
solitude.” 

“Departed? Where did he go?” 
“Who knows, Benoroyle? No one 
was so discourteous as to follow 
him.” 

“You damned fool! Gon’s no 
Meried! He’ll drown! Why the 
devil didn’t you help him?” 
O’Royle cut off his outburst with 
an effort. “I’m sorry, Dreen. Will 
you help me find the boy?” 

“As you wish, Benoroyle — but 
the sea is wide, and filled with 
perils — ” 

“Don’t treat me to any of your 
Meried philosophy now! Just find 
Gon before it’s too late!” 

A lone in the labyrinth, Gon felt 
** a sudden swirl of deeper cold- 
ness around him. Something was 
moving nearby. He backed water, 
retreating into a niche in the rock. 
Then a familiar twittering voice 
spoke: 

“Gon — where are you?” 
“Seryl!” The stab of relief that 
went through the boy was as sharp 
as physical pain. “Seryl! Get me 
out of here, back to the surface!” 
“Gon, you’ve hurt yourself! I 
sense blood in the water!” 

He felt her touch on his arm; 
seeing her face hovering before 
him, her immense eyes wide, he 



wondered how he had ever thought 
her ugly. 

“Please — help me...!” He 
fought down the rising panic. The 
air in his throat seemed hot, stale. 
He was choking, drowning. He had 
to get out. He caught at Seryl’s 
arm, but it slipped away. 

“Come — This way!” she called. 

“I can’t see you!” He choked on 
the words, struck out blindly, 
smashing face-first into sharp- 
edged stone. Then her hand grip- 
ped his, tugging gently. 

“Poor half -man. You’re blind; I 
didn’t know. Come now, I’ll lead 
you.” 

It seemed to Gon that for an end- 
less time they wormed their way 
through a serpentine route, up, 
down, twisting, turning, at times 
forcing their way along passages 
barely wide enough to pass, then 
swimming a few strokes until the 
way narrowed again. Attempting to 
squeeze through a vertical crevice, 
he stuck fast. The girl tugged at 
his hands, uselessly. 

“No good. I’ll have to go back.” 
He tried to retreat, found that he 
was wedged equally tightly against 
withdrawal. He attempted to turn 
his body, succeeded only in cutting 
his hide on the sharp edges of vol- 
canic rock. 

“Gon — careful!” Now there 
was anxiety in the girl’s voice. “The 
sea-hunters roam herel If they 
scent blood . ” 

He fought silently then, in blind 

IF 



114 




panic. He was only dimly aware of 
the girl’s voice calling to him, of 
her hands trying to hold his flail- 
ing arms. 

“Gon — they’re here!” Her cry 
cut through his panic. He went 
slack then, hung, half in, half out 
of the fissure, watching a thing likg 
an eight-foot otter or beaver, black 
and sinuous, armed with a tiger’s 
jaws. It cruised past at a distance 
of ten feet, stroking with broad, 
seal-like flukes, studying him with 
wide, dark-glistening eyes. Gon 
recognized it as a mutated dog, a 
remote descendant of a retriever or 
herder brought from Terra cen- 
turies before, now grown large, wild 
and fierce, the ancient subservience 
of its kind to man forgotten. With 
sudden decision, it started in, jaws 
gaping. 

Seryl set the butt of her spear 
gun against her shoulder, fol- 
lowed the patrolling carnivore as it 
shot forward ancl fired. A plastic- 
feathered quarrel sprang out and 
sank to half its length in the side 
of the predator. Instantly, the crea- 
ture whirled to bite at the shaft, 
fighting like a hooked tarpon; but 
as the smoky blood wafted from 
the wound in a widening veil, a 
second sea-dog closed; in a light- 
ning snap it opened the dying ani- 
mal’s throat. Through water 
abruptly opaque with an ink-black 
stain, Gon caught glimpses of swift- 
darting bodies that struck, and 
struck and struck .... 



'T'ime had passed. How long, 
Gon didn’t know. But his air 
was running out. Where was Seryl? 
How long had he been trapped 
here? How long since Brother Glad 
had bade him farewell on the 
shore? 

A long time — too long. His air 
was gone. 

Here he would gig — 

The flash of teetE brought him 
from his state of shocked reverie; 
a creature half agaig as large as 
the sea-dog Seryl Sad killed had 
swept past him dose enough to buf- 
fet him where K§ lay, wedged in 
the rock — a porpoise, once a mild- 
mannered friend of man, here on 
Meries driven by the competition 
of competing mammals into the 
role of voracious killer, hungry for 
the flesh of warm-blooded sea- 
beasts. 

The killer-porpoise turned, pa- 
trolling back past him. Beyond it 
Gon saw others of its kind, gliding 
like grim torpedoes in formation. 
In a moment one would turn on 
him; with one snap of those spike- 
studded jaws, it could take off his 
arm — or his head. 

Better to drown than to be torn 
to pieces. He reached, found the 
quick-release latch, and slipped the 
tank harness. The mouthpiece was 
ripped away as, with a twist and 
a kick, he tore free from the har- 
ness, pushed away from the rock, 
and shot toward the surface a hun- 
dred and fifty feet above. 



THE HALF MAN

'T'he pain struck O’Royle with- 
^ out warning, like a blow in 
the chest with a spiked club. He 
gave a single gasping grunt and 
doubled over, tumbling as the pow- 
erful water jets drove him errati- 
cally on. He managed to switch off 
power and hung, afloat now in a 
sea of agony wider than the Con- 
tinental Ocean. 

Time passed — how long, he had 
no idea. Slowly, he became aware 
that he was drifting, head-down, in 
black water. Fire still burned in 
his chest, but it was a bed of em- 
bers now, not a roaring blaze. He 
moved, mid pain lanced through 
his rib-cage. Slowly, awkwardly, like 
a crippled insect, he straightened 
his body, began to move slowly to- 
ward the mile-distant shore. Gon 
was still out there; but Dreen and 
the others would find him. He had 
done that much, anyway. Now the 
trick was to reach shore alive, to 
be there waiting when they brought 
the poor lad back. 

G on’s lungs were bursting. How 
far above was the surface? 
He stroked, stroked, eyes bulging, 
jaws locked, chest straining. It had 
to be close now; only a little far- 
ther. His vision was blurring, shot 
through with red; his lungs ached, 
his tissues screamed their torture. 
Hold on, hold on — 

Without his conscious volition, 
against every conscious instinct for 
self-preservation, his mouth open- 



ed, his lungs heaved convulsively. 
He felt the icy pressure in his 
throat, the burning pain as the sea 
water flooded his straining lungs — 
and blackness flooded his mind. 

/^VRoyle did not suspect his er- 
^ ror until the rush of inch- 
long crustaceans swirled around 
him like a flock of startled birds. 
Then they were gone — and a vast 
gray-black body hurtled after 
them. 

“Sea-bull,” O’Royle grunted. 
“Deep-sea critter. What’s it doing 
this close to shore?” 

He glanced at his compass — 
and then he saw. He had been 
holding steadily on course — di- 
rectly away from shore. By now he 
was five miles at sea, in the dread- 
ed Deep, where the big hunters 
roamed, looking for red meat. 

VI 

/^on floated in a pink mist of 
pleasure, wafted from cloud 
to sunset cloud on a perfumed 
breeze. At his whim, he sailed ef- 
fortlessly across the pillow-soft sky, 
drifted with the gentle tides of air, 
plunged downward in a dizzying 
swoop, soared upward again, faster 
than thought .... 

“It’s the dream again,” he 
thought. “The dream of flying. 
But this time it’s real. I can fly. 
I always knew I could, if I could 
just remember the trick ...” 



THE HALF MAN 



117 




He flew on, savoring the total 
freedom of the spirit and body that 
expressed itself in soaring high 
above all mundane cares. Brother 
dad, Cruthers, the others, seemed 
remote, unreal. There had been a 
thing he had worried about; what 
was it? It seemed so far away now, 
so unimportant. Something about a 
role he had to play in the Plan of 
the Infinite. Gon almost laughed 
aloud at the innocence of the con- 
ception: that the power that had 
evoked galaxies from nothingness 
should require the intervention of 
a bo§r to bring about its pur- 
poses.... 

Brother Glad had wanted him to 
go to Meries, the water-world where 
he had been born, where his mother 
had died in the birthing; to go 
down again to the sea, seek out his 
kin, begin a movement to bring 
them back to Terra. 

Back to Terra! This time Gon 
laughed, surrendering himself to 
the inexpressible grotesquerie of 
the idea. Back to Terra — to live 
in goldfish bowls, and flatten their 
noses against the glass, begging the 
aquarium visitors for crumbs of 
fishfood? Or to waddle about the 
dry, dusty streets of the cities, 
wearing water-filled helmets? Or 
perhaps to swim glumly about the 
polluted Earthly seas, on the alert 
for the mile-wide pelagic harvest- 
ing craft. Once caught in their wa- 
ter-sweeps, they’d windup as organic 
fertilizer for hydroponic farms! 



Gon blinked the tears of hilarity 
from his eyes — and as he did, he 
became aware suddenly of a cold- 
ness and a pressure against his ribs. 
He moved to relieve the discom- 
fort and felt a sense of vertigo that 
made him flail out with both hands 
to bring himself upright. Smoky, 
gray-brown opacity swirled before 
him. He waved it away, was look- 
ing out across a rolling expanse of 
dun-colored hills, densely grown 
with tall, willowy plants that waved 
in the light but irrestible wind-like 
images reflected in the surface of 
a pool. The light that shone from 
the green-black sky seemed to wav- 
er, rippling through minutely dis- 
cernible changes of intensity. It 
was a weirdly alien landscape — 
and yet, in some indefinable way, 
a comfortable one. But — where 
was he? 

He now remembered Brother 
Glad’s invitation to accompany 
him, the preparations for the trip, 
the long, eventless weeks in 
space .... 

And the landing on the deserted 
shore . and the building of the 
camp .... 

The rolling, phosphorescent sea. 
Himself wading into the cold, alien 
surf, Brother Glad urging him on; 
his first swim, the let-down as no 
Meried came swarming to meet 
him, the discouragement, the sui- 
cidal thoughts. The one, last try 
that he had privately promised 
himself to make, after which — 

IF 



118 




A fter? What had happened? Had 
-*** he been successful or ... ? 

He remembered a face, narrow- 
bluish-green, wide-eyed, purse- 
mouthed, sleek. 

Seryl. He had met her, and — 

With a convulsive movement, 
Gon fought to tear free of the re- 
membered trap — and drifted ef- 
fortlessly forward across the wav- 
ing grass-plain beneath him. 

Vm flying , the thought crashed 
into his mind. But that was a 
dream . 

But l } m not dreaming now; Vm 
awake — and still Vm flying . He 
moved his hands and at once his 
body responded, angling up and to 
the left, drifting as lightly as a gas- 
filled balloon. 

Drifting. But not like a balloon; 
like a fish in water. 

Not flying, swimming. 

Not breathing air . but water. 

Gon drew a deep breath, felt the 
healing coolness flow in, flow out 
again. He was breathing under the 
sea. He had lost his mask and 
mouthpiece, and he was still alive. 
Lost in the wonder of the miracle, 
he drifted with the swift current 
toward the deep sea. 

/Consciousness was a light pow- 
^ ered by a failing battery. As 
his awareness flickered dimly alight 
again, O’Royle knew that it was 
hopeless, that he would never reach 
the distant shore. He throttled 
back the wet-jet with a motion that 



sent new pangs stabbing through 
his chest, and hung motionless, his 
body a broken vessel filled with 
pain. 

Pressure waves beat against him; 
a thing vast as a whale loomed out 
of dimness, tossing him like a chip 
in its wake. O’Royle saw the great 
scarred flank slide past him at a 
distance of less than three yards, 
saw the strokes of the mighty flip- 
pers that could crush a man with 
a careless flick, unaware of his pre- 
sence. 

But this monster was aware, he 
realized as it turned and made a 
second pass at even closer range. 
This time he saw the coiled pro- 
boscis, the narwhale-Iike tusks, the 
spined ears, the great swell of the 
crested shoulders as the grampus 
— a mutated Indian elephant — 
swam straight at him. O’Royle half 
expected to see the jaws gape to 
snap him up, but at the last mo- 
ment, the behemoth rolled, show- 
ing a flash of the shark-like teeth 
studding the wide mouth, modified 
for flesh eating, not by man, but 
by natural mutation, here in the 
adopted environment of Meries. 
The giant meat-eater was confused 
by the sterile scent of the protec- 
tive suit, O’Royle knew; but in an- 
other moment, satisfied of his 
harmlessness, its appetite would as- 
sert itself. The next pass would be 
the last. 

He watched it move away, turn 
with a lazy flick of its modified

limbs, hover, measuring him for 
the kfll. He saw the trunk go up, 
the jaws open. As helpless as a new- 
born infant, he waited for the final 
charge. 

VII 

TTThen Seryl returned with a par- 
* * ty of sea-men to the place 
where she had left Gon trapped, 
the sea-wolves were still patrolling 
there; but of the half-man there 
was no sign. 

“They’ve taken him,” Dreen 
said. “We’re too late.” 

“No — <1 smell no blood in the 
water — only a trace from his ear- 
lier wounds,” Seryl retorted. “He 
must have freed himself.” 

“Look — his breathing appara- 
tus,” another Meried called, re- 
trieving the tank and attached 
mouthpiece from the sea floor a few 
yards below. “Without this, can he 
live?” 

Seryl uttered a choked cry. 
“Poor half-man! He wished so 
much to live ...” 

“We must find his body,” Dreen 
said. 

“There’s a vicious current here; 
by now the corpse will be far away 
— if the carrion beasts have spared 
it,” a man said. 

“Why venture into dangerous 
waters on a futile quest?” another 
questioned. 

“You needn’t come; but I must 
try, for the sake of my friend, 



whom I failed.” Dreen swam away, 
Seryl beside him. The others hesi- 
tated, then followed. 

'T'he sea-man hailed Gon from a 
1 distance, calling in the 
strange, penetrating under-sea 
voice of his kind:" 

“Sheer off! A hunting grampus 
near! ” 

Gon hesitated, confused by the 
warning and filled with an urgent 
desire to talk. 

“No time to waste,” the stranger 
called. “It’s occupied for the mo- 
ment with easier prey; a dryman, 
poor fool, weighted in his trappings 
like a mud-castler!” 

“A dryman?” Gon queried; but 
the other was gone in the murk. 
A land-dweller, about to be killed 
by a sea-hunter? Could k be 
Brother Glad looking for him? But 
the missionary owned no scuba 
gear — and no one else in the par- 
ty would have reason to come here. 

Cautiously, Gon advanced. A 
pair of sea-men flashed past him 
at the edge of visibility. He went 
on and saw a group of Merieds 
hovering in the water ahead. As he 
swam up to them, one, a small, 
slender female, turned — 

“Gon!” Seryl called sharply, 
coming toward him. Beyond her, 
Gon saw through an obscuring 
haze of roiled silt a shape as big as 
a twenty-man copter, gray-black, 
horny-hided, massive; flippers big- 
ger than a man’s body stroked 



12 * 



IF 




restlessly, holding its position. 

“You’re alive — arid — ” Seryl 
broke off as Gon swept past her, 
his eyes on the man-shape drifting 
in the water ahead. A dryman, as 
the Meried had said, bulky in a 
vermilion-dyed dry-suit with a bub- 
ble helmet, through which the fea- 
tures of a square, lined face, white- 
haired, blue-eyed, were visible. The 
face of Captain Ben O’Royle. 

“Father!” Gon shouted. At his 
cry, the Merieds whirled; the giant 
sea-thing gave an ill-tempered 
thrust of its flukes, turning pon- 
derously to face the new disturb- 
ance. A big sea-man came toward 
Gon as if to intercept him, but he 
veered aside from the out-stretched 
hand, shot to O’Royle’s side. 

“Father! Run! Quick!” Gon 
grabbed at the older man’s arm, 
only then saw that his face was 
slack, his eyes half-shut. 

Gon whirled to the sea-men, ig- 
noring the hovering mass of the 
sea-elephant, which had swung 
again to face him. 

“Help me! He’s sick!” 

“Gon! Beware! He’ll charge!” 
Seryl called. She darted forward, 
raised her tiny spear-thrower, fired 
from the hip, once, twice, three 
times full into the monster’s face. 
Gon felt the tiny shocks, saw the 
darts leap to imbed themselves in 
the expanse of horny hide above 
the back-curled trunk as the sea- 
elephant, head lowered and tusks 
foremost, rushed at him. 



XT' or a frozen instant, time seem- 
* ed to stand still. Gon hung 
motionless, peripherally aware of 
the staring eyes of the helpless sea- 
men in the background, of the un- 
conscious, suited man beside him, 
of the curious translucence of the 
water, of the thumping of his heart, 
watching the bulk of the leviathan 
grow as it hurtled straight at him. 
Then, at the last possible instant, 
he moved aside — not a wild leap 
for safety, but a calculated side- 
step, just sufficient to avoid the 
forward-lunging tusk of the mon- 
ster. Instantly, Gon was in behind 
the spined ear, and with a power- 
ful thrust of his legs, astride the 
horny back, grasping the umbrella- 
ribbed dorsal fin, flattening him- 
self to the curve of the great 
beast’s shoulders. 

The grampus fought. It plunged, 
rolled, flailed backward with its 
trunk. The blows, impeded by the 
density of the medium, thudded 
across Gon’s shoulders like strokes 
with a canvas hose. He pressed 
himself closer, digging his fingers 
into the tender membranes at the 
base of the back-flattened ears, his 
knees locked along the main rib of 
the fin. Over and over the grampus 
rolled; once it slammed the mucky 
bottom, and for a moment Gon was 
immersed in murky ooze; but he 
held his breath, and a moment la- 
ter his mighty mount was streaking 
forward at a speed that sent water 
sluicing back around the clinging 



THE HALF MAN 



121 




rider like the backwash of a tor- 
pedo. 

As the animal’s course veered 
left, Gon twisted at the tender tis- 
sues of the left ear; the grampus 
angled back to the right. Gon hung 
on grimly, saw the color of the wa- 
ter changing, lightening. Abruptly, 
the sea-elephant broke water with 
a Niagara-like smash of surf; it 
crashed back then, splashing and 
hissing, to surge ahead another 
hundred yards. Then it was hump- 
ing itself through the shallows like 
a monster walrus, spewing water 
from its trunk and mouth. Air was 
like fire in Gon’s lungs as he eject- 
ed the water from them. Coughing, 
he clung, waiting for the blow that 
would smash him flat; but pan- 
icked, the sea-elephant had for- 
gotten the weapons of its trunk and 
its bulk. It could have plucked him 
free, trampled him, rolled on him. 
Instead, it floundered up the beach, 
bellowing and snorting. Gon blink- 
ed away the film of water from his 
eyes and saw the survey camp a few 
hundred yards off to the left. He 
saw men running out and heard 
their shouts. Brother Glad appear- 
ed, rifle in hand. As Gon raised 
himself to shout a warning, the 
creature changed course abruptly, 
hurling itself toward the sounds. 
Gon’s knees slipped from their 
grip; the grampus skidded to a 
halt, lowered its head, and tossed. 
Gon felt himself going up and over, 
then falling, to slam against the 



gravelly sand with a stunning im- 
pact. Above him the big bull low- 
ered its head, lunged. The needle- 
tipped ivories gouged into the sand 
on either side of Gon; the horny 
hide of the immense head rasped 
him, bumping him as the beast 
strove to gore him, but was fended 
off by its own tusks. 

There was a sharp car-rong as a 
heavy rifle fired nearby. The mon- 
ster grunted and keeled forward; 
its weight came crushingly on Gon. 
The sky went dark, and far away 
voices shouted through the failing 
fight.

B rother Glad sat smiling at him. 

Beside him, his father, pale 
but recovered, smiled too. 

“They told me what you did, 
Gon,” he said. “You saved my life; 
but more than that, you taught 
them something.” 

“It was a stroke of genius to 
think of driving the beast on shore,” 
Brother Glad said. “The Merieds 
never dreamed of such a thing.” 
“Too bad . you killed it,” Gon 
gasped. There was pain in his chest, 
in his arms, in every bone of his 
body. “They . could be tamed 
. used ...” 

“It’s not dead, just drugged,” the 
missionary said. “Our fellows help- 
ed the sea-men to winch it back 
into the water. When it wakes it 
will be in harness.” His smile wid-

ened. “They have great plans for 
capturing more in the same way.” 

“Gon, the doctor examined you,” 
O’Royle said. “You have a few 
broken ribs, but you’ll be all right. 
But the curious thing is — water 
respiration seems to have had the 
effect of metamorphosizing your 
metabolism. Your reflex times, 
muscular tone — everything — has 
become almost double the Terran 
norm — or the Meried norm, for 
that matter.” 

“It seems to be just what Cap- 
tain O’Royle called it — a meta- 
morphosis,” Brother Glad said. 

“It seems that a Terran-Meried 
hybrid has to spend his infancy on 
dry land,” Gon’s father said. “But 
as an adult, he becomes a true am- 
phibian, breathing water or air 
equally well.” 

“Mr. Cruthers wants to offer 



you a job,” Brother Glad said. “As 
a liaison man with the Merieds. 
Your father and I, between us, 
have convinced him that the Mer- 
ied trade is worth developing.” 
“You’ll be more than a liaison 
man,” O’Royle put in. “You’re a 
hero to the sea-men — and to a sea- 
girl named Seryl. They want you 
as their official ambassador. 
They’ve offered to build you a 
palace, half on land, half under wa- 
ter, and to stock it with the rarest 
delicacies of the ocean — including 
a girl named Seryl.” 

There was more; Gon listened, 
his thoughts afloat on a sea of 
pleasing fancy to rival the green 
ocean he had at last discovered. 

I came here as a man without 
a world,” he said when the others 
fell silent at last. “Now I have 
two.” END

peace-loving Citizen of the 22nd walls. 

Century, had been arrested for The gray-faced judge stared 

some unnamed crime, to appear in down at me as if made of cold steel, 
the Tele-Games of March 8th, “ Charles David Travers, for 



12 4 




Judgment sir,” my escort an- 
nounced like a robot. “Case 2-99 
63567489, of Los Angeles Major, 
California.” 

The judge looked at me. He 
said, “You are brought before the 
High Court for treason against the 
State. How do you plead?” 

Every muscle knotted in disbe- 
lief. “Fve done nothing. This is a 
farce. You have the wrong man.” 

The judge asked, “You are 
Charles David Travers, son of 
David Jay Travers and Joan Mari- 
anne Travers? You have a mistress 
by the name of Julie Thorson? You 
work at the International Message 
Service as a file clerk, Code-5B? 
You are a collector of old books, 
adventure novels, and are in the 
habit of spending hours in librar- 
ies and in your one-room bachelor 
apartment reading? You are the 
Charles David Travers, who wrote 
an article in college defending the 
concept of the Tele-Games as a log- 
ical means of controlling the world 
population and relieving our civili- 
zation of criminals, of giving the 
Citizens the kind of violent enter- 
tainment they so highly desire? An 
article which had its tongue-in- 
cheek subtle double-meaning — ob- 
vious, now in light of what we have 
learned about your true activities.” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“Then there is no mistake,” the 
judge announced with finality. 
“You have been the companion of 
Julie Thorson for the last six 



, months, working with her in an at- 
tempt to overthrow the government. 
You are guilty of first-degree trea- 
son. Miss Thorson has confessed.” 

“It’s a lie!” I shouted. 

“Silence! You will appear before 
the National Tele-Games of March 
8th as a Man-at-Arms to do battle 
to the death. In the event you 
should be the sole survivor, you 
will be freed, never again to be 
sentenced to the Tele-Games. So is 
the fair judgment of the State’s 
Justice.” 

Dazed, I followed the guard out 
of the courtroom and down a series 
of corridors. He stopped before two 
large iron doors and presented an 
identification card to the guard 
there, who allowed him to lead me 
into the inner chambers of the Cen- 
tral Los Angeles prison. 

I was led to a narrow door mark- 
ed 71134. The guard ordered me 
into the cell with a wave of his arm. 
The door closed behind me like the 
clanging of some morbid trap. 

It was a voice that cut into my 
agony. It was filled with a mixture 
of surprise and pained horror. 
“Charlie!” 

All the emotions rushed up in a 
flood, choking all senses like invis- 
ible fingers blotting out sanity. 
Whipping around, I saw the tall 
woman who had been my mistress 
these last months. But I couldn’t 
equate this beautiful creature with 
the one with whom I’d shared si- 
lent walks through building-top 



A DAY FOR DYING

parks or companionable evenings 
in my apartment or simply dancing 
gracefully in the dim night-clubs, 
chatting happily over a dinner and 
cocktails. This couldn’t be that 
same woman 1 

Madness clutched at my brain. 

There stood the creature that 
had placed me here. Through the 
emotion of wild fury I looked at her 
voluptuous body, draped in a green 
glowing cloth that wound around 
her slim waist and angular hips 
above firm thighs, dropping like 
silken waves about every beautiful 
and loving curve of her body. She 
didn’t seem real, standing there in 
the drab coldness of the cell, her 
arms stretched out in offering. 

Sanity snapped like a thread. 

“You lying tramp!” I yelled, 
leaping. My hands gripped her 
silken white throat; my fingers 
squeezed the air back into her 
lungs, trapping it there. 

Maybe it was the look of sur- 
prised horror in her large brown 
eyes that jolted sanity back into 
my shocked brain. My hands low- 
ered as I slowly stepped back. 

“Those lies .. I’ve never done 
anything against the State.” 

She clutched at her throat, gasp- 
ing for air, and finally said, 
“Charles . believe me — I didn’t 
tell them anything / So help me 
God!” 

“Then why?” I managed, con- 
fusion defeating all hatred. 

“Why do they have the Games? 



Why is a person sent to his death 
for voicing, objection against the 
State? Or getting drunk in public, 
or being late paying his bills? 
There doesn’t have to be any logi- 
cal reason!” she blurted. 

“But they had to have some rea- 
son!” 

“You were my companion. Oh, 
Charlie, believe me, I’d do any- 
thing to get you out of this!” Her 
eyes pleaded with me to forgive 
her. They blurred with moisture 
and then closed, tears running 
down her creamy cheeks. 

How could I hate her? She had 
been created for love. And I knew 
she returned my love. Looking at 
her I felt a flood of overwhelming 
emotion. 

Helplessly I folded an arm about 
her waist, gently raised her chin 
until our eyes met. And as I looked 
at her, reality slipped away to be- 
come a fantasy of love. 

“Oh, Charlie, thank God!” she 
breathed. “I was afraid you 
wouldn’t understand! Or forgive.” 

After that the insanity of need 
overwhelmed all other considera- 
tions. There was only my sensa- 
tions and Julie’s form. 

Some time later I was aware of 
Julie moving from me. I sat up and 
asked, “How’d they pick you up? 
Why?” 

She shook her head. “They 
brought me to the Games Judge 
and announced that I was guilty of 
treasons against the State, sen-

tenced me to the Arena and brought 
me here. The next thing I knew 
you were in the cell. That’s the 
whole truth, Charlie.” She shrug- 
ged. "We’re living in the most 
terrible Police State mankind ever 
devised. In our grandparents’ day 
it was different.” 

I merely nodded, aware she 
spoke the truth. Yesterday I would 
have refused to believe. 

My own grandfather had told me 
that in his youth there were tele- 
vision shows of violence, but they 
were plays written by fiction writ- 
ers, performed by professional ac- 
tors. Violence was the keynote. 
Then sporting events became more 
popular than drama, because of the 
real violence. It was a logical step 
to take hardened criminals, al- 
ready condemned to die, and let 
them fight to the death for the 
home audience. Freeing the winner 
always promised a more exciting 
battle. With universal peace, an 
overcrowded world, unemploy- 
ment and depression, the develop- 
ment of the Tele-Games became a 
natural evolution. Now it was an 
international institution that fed 
the greedy public with the blood- 
violence it so craved. People were 
killed. But they were other people! 
That made the difference. 

It might have been only a cou- 
ple of hours or a day before two 
uniformed guards stepped into the 
cell and ordered me out. I was 
taken into a small room where sev- 



eral rows of chairs were facing a 
blank wall. As I sat, the guards 
flanking me, the door opened and 
five grim-looking officers stepped 
in; four seated themselves directly 
behind us and the fifth, a Major, 
stood in front of me. 

"You, Charles Travers, have one 
way to lower the sentence against 
you. Placing you with Miss Thor- 
son was a waste of time; therefore, 
we will show you part of the re- 
cording of her interview.” He then 
sat. 

The room darkened and the wall 
glowed into shimmering blue life. 
To all appearances, it disappeared 
to reveal another room beyond; in 
reality, it was one of those huge 
Tri-D screens. 

The major was standing in front 
of Julie on the screen. "You’ve 
been seeing Travers for months. 
What is his connection with the 
underground movement?” 

"I can’t tell you.” 

"Miss Thorson, you don’t seem 
to realize your position.” 

"I’m fully aware,” she spat out. 
"We don’t give information about 
our activities.” 

The major nodded to one of his 
companions who held a small steel 
box. "This will give the informa- 
tion we want.” 

Julie’s eyes flashed toward the 
box and then jerked back to the 
officer. Her shoulders sagged as 
she announced in a cold voice: 
"Charles Travers is my contact. 



A DAY FOR DYING 



127 




He got me into this. I don’t know 
anything else.” 

The screen went dead and the 
lights snapped on. The real major 
stepped in front of me. “The rest 
of the information’s classified. We 
used the Brain-box to check it out. 
There’s no reason for you to deny 
connection with the Underground 
Nationalist Movement.” 

Sweat broke out over my body. 
No matter what I claimed, they 
wouldn’t believe me. 

The major said, “Just tell us 
who your contacts are.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t know 
what you’re talking about. She was 
lying.” 

The major nodded an done of 
his assistants stepped forward with 
a Brain-box. 

I looked at the mental probe and 
then shrugged, remaining silent. 

One of the men damped a small 
band on my forehead. The man 
holding the box pressed a button 
and reality blacked out . Then 
the room snapped back into place. 

I blinked and looked at the ma- 
jor. It seemed as if a great, terrible 
pressure had been lifted. 

The major frowned, grimacing 
in puzzlement. “It would seem 
Miss Thorson lied — or one of you 
has been conditioned.” 

A gnawing cut at my stomach. 
“How could I afford conditioning? 
Only the Government has the ma- 
chinery for that!” I stood, rage 
tensing every muscle. 



“There are ways. If you are a 
member of the underground, there 
would be ways.” The major laugh- 
ed. “But it makes no difference. 
You have been sentenced — even 
if wrongly — and it will be carried 
out.” 

Violence snapped sanity as he 
turned. I leaped, grabbing his flab- 
by throat. A great feeling of power 
came over me as I gazed into his 
reddening features; his eyes were 
popping out and his tongue was 
convulsively struggling for air. 
Then I felt the other men clawing 
at my arms and body. Something 
hit the back of my head, but I 
didn’t release the major’s neck un- 
til another hard object slammed 
once more at the base of my skull. 

I had awakened in the blackness 
of a cell hours before, unable to 
see anything. It was a small place 
with little room for my six feet to 
stretch out. There wasn’t any bed 
or covers, just hard steel to sleep 
on. Time passed slowly; then 
guards came to take me to a huge 
chamber packed with over a thou- 
sand people, locked behind large 
barred doors. 

I was standing there for some 
time before a gentle hand touched 
my shoulder. I turned to see Julie. 
Her face was white and drawn, her 
lips thin, pale trembling lines. 

“I . had to lie,” she stammer- 
ed. “The cell was tapped.” 

I tried to feel the hate that 
should be inside me, but it wouldn’t

come, jno emotion at au aiiected 
me, “There’s nothing we can do 
about it." 

“I have to make you understand 
what you’re dying for.” She hesi- 
tated, then pulled me aside, away 
from the guards. “I was arrested 
trying to make contact with a man. 
I had to lie to save him. He’s very 
important.” 

"What’s his name?” 

She shook her head sadly. “I 
can’t tell you. You might use the 
name to save yourself.” 

T started to argue the point, 
then shrugged. No matter what, 
I’d be sent into the Arena — to my 
death. The chances of survival 
were reduced to zero. Yet there was 
still hope as long as I lived. 

I found myself reviewing all the 
major combats I’d witnessed in 
the National Events. They were 
Woody battles between inexperi- 
enced citizens armed with clubs, 
rapiers, broadswords and spears. 
No modern-day weapons were al- 
lowed for fear they might be used 
against the guards or the camera- 
men who were lodged just above 
the fighting area. The Arena was 
surrounded by an army of Games 
Police with weapons that could cut 
down every occupant of the Arena 
at a moment’s notice. I’d seen, in 
viewing countless Games, that 
many people stood frozen in fear, 
letting themselves be killed. Oth- 
ers, more realistic, would keep out- 
side the range of the battle until it 



narrowed down to a lew combat- 
ants. This I hoped to do. After 
that, if I survived, I’d try to join 
the underground movement. But it 
was useless to tell Julie that; she 
wouldn’t believe me. 

The two of us stood together, 
holding hands. Finally we were or- 
dered out through a corridor in sin- 
gle file, to another larger room 
lined with armed Games Police. 
There we were handed primitive 
weapons for the Event. 

I was given a small short sword, 
like the ones the Romans had used 
in battle. It was light and made of 
strong steel — unlike Roman weap- 
ons. 

It was the thought of personal 
survival on which I focused as we 
were herded like a mass of dumb 
animals into the confines of the 
Arena. 

At that point something unex- 
pected happened to me, like a cut- 
ting off of all sensation. It was a 
sharp mental shifting, a release 
from fear, as if a switch had been 
pulled, disconnecting emotion. 

I looked at Julie, letting my eyes 
run along her flesh, but felt noth- 
ing. It was as if I had suddenly 
become a zombie, without any de- 
sire other than the want to kill. 

I automatically swung the short 
sword in the air in front of me. My 
huge arms flexed as I stood there 
in the middle of the Arena, sur- 
rounded by fellow citizens, await- 
ing the command to kill. 



A DAY FOR DYING 



129 




Then it came. A loud blast of 
horns. 

My sword swung Into the skull 
of a man standing next to me. I 
didn’t wait to let others defend 
themselves. The short sword 
moved, cutting into arms, chests, 
heads and necks, creating a bloody 
passage of death until a mass of 
bodies were cluttering my passage. 
Then I was facing a tall man car- 
rying a huge broadsword. 

He swung the weapon right at 
my head. Ducking to one side, I 
whipped the point of my blade to- 
ward his chest; it cut lightly into 
the flesh, drawing a thin line oi 
red. He swung again, a slicing blow 
at my stomach. With speed and 
skill I shouldn’t have possessed, I 
leaped in close and rammed the 
short sword deep into his gut, 
twisting with sadistic delight. With- 
drawing my sword, I turned and 
dropped the edge of the bloody 
blade into a woman’s skull. The 
weapon wrenched from my hand 
locked in the bony tissue of her 
head. 

Turning, I picked up the broad- 
sword from my fallen male antag- 
onist of a moment before and swung 
it in a circle through the neck of 
one man and across the chest of a 
woman whose body sliced open, the 
insides bursting out like a bloody 
fountain. 

I made a path of dead bodies 
before me, like cutting wheat in 
the fields; then I spotted Julie 



holding a Scottish broadsword and 
making a path of death much like 
my own, without any emotion on 
her face. There wasn’t time to mar- 
vel at Julie’s unnatural skill; she 
should have died in the first mo- 
ments. 

It’s amazing how fast a couple of 
thousand people will die when all 
are enemies of each other. It seem- 
ed but minutes before less than a 
dozen people still lived and I 
found myself without an opponent. 
My eyes searched the Arena. I 
spotted Julie still alive, cutting 
down a tall muscular man with one 
swing of her blade. She looked sav- 
agely magnificent standing there, 
the broadsword clutched in her 
hands, long hair hanging loose and 
flying as she turned to make an- 
other kill. But now there was none 
other than myself. 

It seemed strangely ironic, even 
fantastic, that it should have ended 
this way. 

She rushed at me calmly, a prim- 
itive, mindless killer. Her blade 
swung at my right arm, but merely 
cut the outer layer of flesh. It was 
enough to make me accept real 
danger. Her light sword, built for 
fast movement, might easily prove 
superior to my heavy weapon. 

Instinct snapped my broadsword 
toward her head. It would be over 
quickly. At least she would die 
without much pain, I told myself. 

But her sword met my blade 
with superhuman strength. Then 



130 



IF 




the point jerked out and flicked at 
my chest, just missing. Our eyes 
met at that moment, but there was 
only a black expression on her face. 

In the next minutes we exchang- 
ed blows which must have given 
the Tele-Games’ viewers the great- 
est excitement in their lives. 

We weren’t two amateurs bat- 
tling to the death; we were expert 
fighters. Where either of us had 
learned our skill was impossible 
even to guess. How could I have 
known the truth? 

I moved with all the sweeping 
speed in my muscles, attempting to 
put a quick end to the duel. It was 
as if some Fate had made us al- 
most perfectly matched. Each was 
skilled to perfection; each was 
seeking the death of a former lover. 

Then she suddenly leaped for- 
ward, the point of her sword reach- 
ing for my chest. I side-stepped, 
using every muscle in my body. At 
the same time my sword moved in 
an arc toward Julie’s middle. 

She had been caught off balance, 
unable to check the forward move- 
ment. My blade sliced cleanly 
across her mid-section. 

Oddly I felt nothing but relief. 
It was over. I’d survived. 

Then I noticed something so 
alarming that I couldn’t believe it 
at first. Where Julie’s body was 
cut open appeared an odd, twisted 
mass of wires, circuits and plastic 
flesh. 

Without thinking, without want- 



ing to guess what this implied, I 
collapsed over he rform as if ex- 
hausted. My hands turned her body 
so that the gaping hole was hidden 
from view. How much this ex- 
plained! 

I stood and walked to the Free- 
dom Door, the cameras following 
my every action. As I stepped from 
the Arena, I was surrounded by in- 
ternational reporters, eager with 
questions that I answered until a 
small dark man stepped up. He 
said, “Come, follow me.” 

His attitude was so much that ©I 
an Official of the Games that I fol- 
lowed automatically. He carried a 
pass that let us through the guard- 
ed corridors and out into the streets 
of Los Angeles. He indicated a car 
parked in front of the building and 
we got in. 

As we pulled away from the 
curb and sped hurriedly down the 
street, I demanded in alarm, 
“Where are you taking me?” 

“I’m Julie Thorson’s contact,” 
was his answer. “All will he ex-* 
plained shortly.” 

“But Julie was — ” 

“An android?” He smiled in a 
strange, almost sad manner. “Ev- 
erything will be explained.” 

We drove in silence through the 
streets for half an hour before 
stopping at a small building in the 
outskirts of the city. He escorted 
me into the house and I found my- 
self in a living room filled with 
people. 



A DAY FOR DYING 



131 




Afl stood and turned, looking at 
me. 

What I saw then scared me far 
more than anything I’d experi- 
enced in the last days. There, stand- 
ing before me, was Julie Thorson, 
quite alive and beautiful! I started 
to take a step forward when a man 
beside her turned and began to 
speak. I stood there, stunned. 

“Von see, Charlie,” he said, “we 
secretly developed perfect an- 
droids; we gave them truthful 
memory backgrounds up to a point 
and then added a fictional back- 
ground to bide information that we 
couldn’t let the authorities know 
about. We had to find out how per- 
fectly they had been made, to see 
if it were possible to fool the Gov- 
ernment Officials. Of course no- 
body, outside of those in this room, 
knows about our discovery. And 
nobody would even imagine such a 
thing if the evidence were put be- 
fore his eyes.” 

He paused, smiling sadly, then 
continued, “You see how valuable 



this will be in our efforts to over- 
throw the now existing govern- 
ments and end the Tele-Games. 
Agents who have inhuman strength 
and ability, programmed to know 
nothing other than the ‘instinctive’ 
missions given them. The Brain- 
boxes will reveal nothing. We even 
had to give our androids sexual 
drives and a sense of synthetic ex- 
citement; the absence of such small 
things might prove a give-away. 
That explains why you were able 
to enjoy a seemingly normal sen- 
sual relation with . your Julie 
Thorson. The experiment worked 
out perfectly. We couldn’t have 
wished for more.” 

I stood there dazed, shocked in- 
to believing what I saw and heard. 
It all fit perfectly together. 

“What about me, now?” was my 
only question. 

“After you have taped a full re- 
port you will be re-programmed,” 
said the real Charles David Trav- 
ers.

ceptance of the idea that Mars 
must have intelligent life to ac- 
count for the so-called canals.

When writers got tired of the lim- 
its of the Solar System, they nat- 
urally carried their plots filled with 
alien contacts to the stars. 

At the time, this all seemed hope- 
lessly unscientific, and several sci- 
entists wrote some rather snide 
comments on science-fictional be- 
liefs in the miraculous existence of 
life all over the universe. Men had 
once believed that life could arise 
spontaneously, but science had 
learned better. Long before, the 
Abb6 Spallanzani proved that 
many-celled life could only grow 
from a seed or an egg; and later, 
Louis Pasteur showed that even 
one-celled life could not arise from 
non-living substances. Hence, life 
was an inexplicable miracle. We 
had to accept the fact that it had 
happened once, since we were here; 
but logic denied any wholesale 
sowing of miracles and made us 
unique in being alive. 

Of course, Svante Arrhenius had 
suggested that life might be spread 
from world to world by spores that 
could Stand even the conditions of 
space. 

Bat that didn’t help much, 
though a number of writers used 
the theory of justification for their 
aliens. An examination of the rate 
at which such spores could be 
spread from star to star by light 
pressure made the wide dissemina- 
tion of such life almost as much of 
a miracle as spontaneous genera- 
tion on every world would be. 



'T'he first crack in the unique- 
ness of our existence came in 
1936 when a Russian biochemist 
A. I. Oparin published a theory on 
the origin of life on Earth. So far 
as I can remember, few stories 
mentioned this; and even in scien- 
tific circles it caused less comment 
than it deserved. But it should 
have served as a perfect justifica- 
tion for our desire to have an in- 
exhaustible supply of aliens, bug- 
eyed or not. 

Oparin’s theory not only ex- 
plained how life could come about 
here, but made such life almost in- 
evitable in the development of any 
Earth-like planet. It was based up- 
on the best scientific picture of 
what our early atmosphere must 
have been like before life arose. 

Such an atmosphere could not 
contain free oxygen. That gas is far 
too corrosive to stay uncombined. 
Without plants to break down car- 
bon dioxide gas and free the oxy- 
gen, all of the oxygen in the air 
would unite with other elements in 
about 2000 years, leaving none for 
animals to breathe. 

Earth’s early atmosphere must 
have resembled the gases in the 
deep ocean of air around Jupiter. 
There would be methane, a simple 
compound of carbon and hydrogen, 
and ammonia gas — a compound 
of nitrogen and hydrogen. There 
might have been some free hydro- 
gen, as well as water vapor, a little 
carbon dioxide and traces of some 



134 



IF 




sulfur compounds. It was a noxi- 
ous mixture, in other words. 

Oparin reasoned that the action 
of lightning bolts striking through 
such a mixture of gases would cause 
more complicated compounds to 
form, among which would be the 
amino acids that are the basis of 
all living protoplasm. 

By 1949, this became more than 
a mere theory. Dr. Hermann J. 
Muller — under the direction of 
Dr. Harold C. Urey — demon- 
strated it at the University of Chi- 
cago. A mixture of such gases was 
put in a flask and treated with 
electric current from a carbon arc. 
The resulting compounds were col- 
lected in water and analyzed. 

To the amazement of those con- 
ducting the experiment, there was 
a very high yield of amino acids 
In fact, there was even some dis- 
cussion of using the process for 
commercial preparation of the 
acids. The water turned into a pink 
“soup.” And not only were the am- 
ino acids present, but it turned out 
they were present in about the 
same percentages relative to each 
other as they were in living tissues. 

Then it was found that the ac- 
tion of ultraviolet light could cause 
the process to occur without the 
need of the electric spark. 

Given the conditions that scien- 
tists are sure must have existed on 
Earth perhaps three-and-a-half bil- 
lion years ago, there had to be an 
enormous production of the basic 



materials from which life is made. 
Such substances are quickly de- 
troyed in an oxygen atmosphere; 
but since there was then almost no 
free oxygen, they were stable and 
would continue to accumulate. The 
shallow seas of that ancient Earth 
must have been very literally a 
rich broth. There was no ozone lay- 
er (since ozone is a form of free 
oxygen, having three, atoms per 
molecule instead of the normal 
two), and hence no screen to hold 
back the full ultraviolet radiation 
of the sun. Earth was one enormous 
chemical factory turning out amino 
acids. 

O parin had no idea of how rich 
the production must have 
been. He had theorized that even 
a few such compounds might com- 
bine into a sort of primitive pro- 
tein if given enough time. But the 
results of the experiments indicate 
that there was such a huge amount 
of amino acids that the combining 
into more complicated forms must 
have occurred over and over again. 
There may very well not have been 
a single initial life-form, but many 
similar ones. 

The shakiest part of the whole 
thing lay in the need to get those 
separate amino acids to combine 
into sufficiently large and complex 
a molecule. But later experiments 
indicated that even this problem 
was not a real one. When collected 
into a broth under conditions that 



IF . AND WHEN 



135 




prevailed in those ancient times, 
the 22 different amino acids that 
form life showed a natural tenden- 
cy to attach themselves together in 
long chains. The giant molecules 
that are necessary to life arise auto- 
matically. The only problem would 
be to prevent them from doing so. 

By now we know that it is almost 
impossible to draw a sharp line be- 
tween life and non-life. The tobac- 
co mosaic virus can exist as a pure 
crystal, seemingly no different from 
many other non-living crystals; yet 
on the tobacco plant it becomes an 
active virus that shows every char- 
acteristic of life. In between it and 
a one-celled plant or an amoeba 
there is an almost continuous spec- 
trum. 

Life apparently didn’t suddenly 
appear; it evolved. Some combina- 
tions of amino acids had a greater 
tendency than others to add more 
budding blocks onto themselves; 
semfe of these grew too big and un- 
wieldy and split; and some of these 
split (reproduced) into two equal 
parts (hat carried on this greater 
efficiency. Accidental changes — 
mutations — are frequent in sim- 
ple organisms, and such changes 
produced even more efficient 
forms. 

For eons, perhaps, the sea broth 
offered all the nutriment necessary, 
together with the new “food” that 
must have been dropping froqi the 
atmosphere as creation went on. 
Then some cell added a trace of 



magnesium from the sea water by 
some Occident to produce chloro- 
phyl. This first plant began to 
change the atmosphere by releasing 
free oxygen. This, of course, put an 
end to the spontaneous generation 
of life by upsetting the conditions 
that had made it possible — and 
also destroyed most of the evidence. 

So far, science has not created 
life from the raw elements direct- 
ly. But every essential step has 
been tried and proved. We know 
that the only miracle involved in 
the start of life is to be found in 
the normal laws of chemistry. 

We also know now that life must 
be as common in the universe as 
science fiction has always assumed. 
Our current theories and such evi- 
dence as we have indicate that 
most stars somewhat similar to our 
sun have planetary systems and 
that each such system should have 
at least one planet suitable for the 
creation of life. There is a very 
good chance that we will find liv- 
ing creatures — and even oxygen 
atmospheres suitable for our habi- 
tation — around most of the stars 
we will explore in interstellar ships. 

I ntelligence is another matter. 

The technically advanced ene- 
mies or the friendly savages so use- 
ful to our story plots are only 
slightly less improbable today than 
they were forty years ago. 

Time is the enemy of our de- 
sires in this case. Life began on 



136 



IF 




Earth during the first billion years 
of the planet’s existence and has 
gone on for almost four billion 
more years by now; there’s a good 
chance that it will be another five 
billion years before the sun grows 
too hot and unstable for such life 
to continue. That means that life 
will have been on Earth during 
90 % of its existence as a planet. 

The first vertebrate creature — 
some early form of fish — appeared 
only about half a billion years ago. 
The first warm-blooded animal may 
go back only a hundred million 
years. And the earliest form of man 
that we could consider even re- 
motely human dates from perhaps 
a million years in the past. We 
wouldn’t consider him much, prob- 
ably, even beside the most primi- 
tive human being our history 
shows. 

Stars come in all ages. Some are 
just forming now and building their 
planets with them. Others are al- 
most at the end of their hydrogen- 
fusion cycle, after which no habi- 
table planets will exist. And the 
factors producing intelligence are 
so complex that we can’t possibly 
guess the time needed for another 
race. Intelligence occupies such a 
tiny and uncertain period in his- 
tory that the chance of finding it 
elsewhere is almost nonexistent. 

Of course, we can hope that in- 
telligence, once reached, will con- 
tinue forever. The evidence isn’t 
favorable; the bigness of the dino- 

IF . AND WHEN 



saur and the striking power of the 
sabertooth vanished before ad- 
vances none could have foreseen. 
But maybe intelligence is the ulti- 
mate goal of life. 

Certainly, however, it will not be 
static. Evolution seems to go faster 
as we rise higher, rather than halt- 
ing. Australopithecus of a million 
years ago would have less in com- 
mon with us than with Proconsul 
of ten million years before. We may 
be still further from “man” of ten 
thousand years in the future. A 
primate learned to use his hands 
and built a brain around them to 
create us. What will man build 
around DNA when he learns to use 
it, for instance? 

When we write about our aliens, 
we cover no more than our earliest 
history of a few millennia ago to 
perhaps not even a century ahead. 
It is too small a second to consider 
in the day of a planet. Or so sci- 
ence and logic tell us. We are not 
unique among stars in having plan- 
ets, nor among planets in having 
life. But we’re still unique in our 
particular concept of intelligence. 
Science fiction is just wish-dream- 
ing, as usual, in having us meet 
alien intelligences so like ourselves. 

As usual? 

We were right and logic was 
wrong about there being planets 
around the stars and about life on 
those planets. I can only hope we 
are wish-dreaming as usual I Well

WHERE THE 
BEAST RMS 

by DEAN R. KOONTZ 

Illustrated by ADKINS 



Bounty hunting is never for the 
squeamish. But this Beast was 
one no sane man could ever kill. 



I 

L ong ago, shortly after my moth- 
er^ blood was sluiced from 
the streets of Changeover and 
her body burned upon a pyre out- 
side of town, I suffered what the 



seems a very inadequate word to 
psychologists call a trauma. That 
me. 

To understand this trauma, you 
should know some of the events 
that preceded > it. The townfolk 
came in the middle of the night 



138 





and took her, decapitated her, 
stuffed a cross cut from stale bread 
into her dead mouth, and charred 
her in fire fed by the bows of a 
dogwood tree. I was five years old 
at the time. 

Those were the days when men 
still killed, before Hope sprang up 
as the capital of our galaxy and 
pushed forth a society where no 
man killed another man, where san- 
ity ruled. That was a thousand 
years ago, a century after Galactic 
War I, before Eternity Combine 
gave us immortality. And worst of 
all, that was Earth. The rest of the 
galaxy was staggering to its feet; 
Hope was an idea born in brighter 
minds; and Earthmen were still 
hunting witches. 

To hide me from those who 
Would destroy me because my 
mother was a mutant who could 
lift pencils — only pencils and 
scraps of paper — with her mind, 
my grandparents locked me in a 
doset of their house. There were 
smells of mothballs, old rubber, 
rainshoes and yellowed magazine 
paper. I could see dark ghosts of 
wools and cottons hanging all 
about. 

And I wept. There was little else 
to do. 

On the third day, the witch hunt- 
ers were certain that I had per- 
ished in the fire of the house, for 
they could not find me and trusted 
my grandparents, chiefly because 
they were normal. So it was that 



on the third day I was brought 
forth from the closet and into the 
parlor where my grandmother kiss- 
ed me and dried her eyes on her 
gray, coarse apron. On that same 
day, my grandfather came to me 
where I sat with my grandmother, 
his huge calloused hands folded 
over each other, concealing some- 
thing. “I’ve a surprise for you, 
Andy.” 

I smiled. 

He took one hand from the oth- 
er, revealing a lump of coal with 
eyes a shade darker than the rest 
of it. “Caesar!” I cried. Caesar was 
my myna bird, rescued in some 
miraculous fashion from the holo- 
caust of the exorcism. 

I ran to my grandfather; and as 
I ran, the bird screeched in imi- 
tation: “Andyboy, Andyboy.” I 

stopped and stared at it. It flut- 
tered a wing. “Andyboy, Andyboy, 
An — ” 

And I started to scream. It was 
an involuntary scream, tom from 
my lungs, bursting through my lips, 
roaring into the room. The myna’s 
words were mockings of my moth- 
er’s. The inflection, though not 
tone, was perfect. 

I turned and ran from the par- 
lor. Wings beat against me. Caesar 
was a stuck recording. 

Grandfather was running too, 
but he was not grandfather any 
longer. Instead, he seemed one of 
the witch hunters shooting out the 
windows of our house, screaming 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS 



139 




faildly for my mother’s death. 

Running through the half open 
cellar door, I stumbled down the 
steps, flailing at the hideous wings, 
the sharp orange beak that tried to 
be her lips. I locked myself in the 
coal room while Caesar battered 
himself to tatters against the thick 
door. When grandfather finally 
broke it down, I was on my knees 
with my head against the floor, un- 
able to scream in anything but a 
hoarse whisper. My knuckles were 
raw from pounding them against 
the concrete, my blood a polka-dot 
pattern on the grayness. 

I was taken to bed, nursed to 
recovery and sent off-planet to an 
aunt’s home in another solar sys- 
tem where men were coming of age 
faster. I grew up, took Eternity 
Combine’s treatments in the first 
public group and outlived Caesar, 
grandfather and all. 

Years later, at one of Congress- 
man Horner’s parties, a psycholo- 
gist told me it had all been a trau- 
ma concerning Death and my new 
perception of it. I told him trauma 
was a terribly inadequate word and 
went off to dance with a particu- 
larly beautiful young woman. 

^Tow I was experiencing fear 
much the same as the fear 
that day so long ago when I was 
five and my mother was three days 
dead. It was the fear of death — 
stinking, oppressive, omnipresent. 
I am always afraid at the begin- 



ning of a hunt. It made no differ- 
ence this day that I had gone on 
215 others; it was this one that was 
immediate — and frightening. If I 
was killed in these jungles, Eter- 
nity Combine could never reach 
me in time to restore me to life. 
Dying here, one stayed dead. 

And what for? Money? Certain- 
ly, that was part of it. Lotus, Crazy 
and I would pick up seventy thou- 
credits apiece when we split the 
bounty on this Beast. But it was 
more than money. Lotus was all 
stirred up by the photos of children 
who had fallen prey to the Beast. 
She’s soft-hearted for kids and dogs. 
Crazy? Well, he had a brother who 
was a bounty hunter too. His 
brother had tried to bring back 
this particular Beast, and his broth- 
er had never been seen again. It 
was revenge for Crazy. Then there 
was blood lust. We didn’t kid our- 
selves about that. In a world where 
killing was horrifying to nearly ev- 
eryone, we killed. True, only ani- 
mals. But the point is we had a 
violence-tendency that was missing 
in most. We wouldn’t kill people, 
but Beasts were another story . 
I guess blood lust was my major - 
driving force, all stemming back to 
that trauma. 

I loaded the last of the cameras 
into the floater and looked around 
for the others. “Lotus! Crazy! Let’s 
get a move on!” 

“All right, all right,” Crazy said, 
stomping down the steps of the out- 

IF 



140 




side entrance to the guest house. 
We were staying on Congressman 
Homer’s Earth Ranch until the 
completion of the hunt. Crazy 
Horse, since he weighed three hun- 
dred pounds plus fifty and was 
blessed with hooves, did not use 
the highly polished, slippery indoor 
steps of plasti-glass. Oh, his full, 
real name was Jackson Lincoln 
Puicca, after the famous General, 
famous humanitarian and famous 
scientist. But we called him Crazy 
Horse — mostly because he was 
crazy — and because he sure did 
look like a horse. 

Crazy was a natural mutant, not 
a product of the Artificial Wombs. 
One day there had been a nuclear 
war spreading through the civilized 
galaxy. Several generations later, 
there was Crazy — muscular, 
bright, shaggy-headed, and horse- 
befainded. He was a valuable man 
on a bounty hunt. Just as his broth- 
er must have been . 

"Where’s Lotus?” I asked. 

"Out picking berries somewhere. 
You know her.” 

"You know what about her?” 
Lotus asked as she lifted over a 
corral fence, her blue-fog wings 
fluffing gently as she glided on the 
breeze. "What would you say of 
me behind my back, Crazy?” 

Crazy Horse stomped his hooves, 
folded his hands in supplication. 
"What could I say behind your 
back, pretty one, when you’re pos- 
sessed of such ears?” 



Lotus settled on the ground next 
to me. She fingered the delicate, 
elongated shells that were her elfin 
ears and looked at Crazy. "Yours 
are bigger. I don’t think I should 
make nasty remarks about an- 
other’s ears if mine were distended 
bladders like yours.” 

Crazy snorted and shook his 
huge head so that his wild mane 
covered his baggy ears. 

“I’m on time, I trust,” Lotus 
said. 

"Trouble is,” I said, putting an 
arm about her twenty-inch waist 
and looking at her small four-feet- 
eleven form, "you know damned 
well we’d wait all day and not be 
angry at you.” 

“That’s because I’m the pretti- 
est girl around,” she snapped, her 
green-blue eyes adance. 

"Not much competition on an 
all-male ranch,” Crazy muttered. 

"And you, Crazy, are the hand- 
somest horse I have seen here.” 
She said it so that he didn’t know 
whether to be mad or laugh — so 
he laughed. 

T hat was Lotus. She was cute 
as Christmas multiplied by 
Halloween and Easter — and she 
knew it, which wasn’t always so 
bad because she pulled her own 
weight. Aside from being one of the 
best botanists specializing in post- 
A-war plants, she was our aerial re- 
connaissance expert since she could 
fly ahead, land where a floater 

141 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS 




would never fit, and let us know 
what was dangerous or interesting 
that stood in our way. Why a bot- 
anist on a bounty hunt? Well, it 
was true we usually stalked killer 
animals that disturbed the small 
towns on the post-war rural plan- 
ets. But now and again there were 
plants which were just as deadly. 
There were those walking plants on 
Fanner II that latched onto the 
nearest warm-blooded animal — of- 
ten human-type — lashed roots 
around it, grew through it all night 
long, absorbed it and walked away 
with the sunrise — a few inches 
taller and satisfied until darkness 
came again, which was every nine 
hours on Fanner II. Thus, Lotus. 

“Let’s get moving,” I said. “I 
want these cameras set before 
dark.” 

“After you, Butterfly,” Crazy 
said, bowing as far as he could, 
considering his less-than-human 
posterior. 

Lotus breezed into the floater 
like a smoke puff. Crazy followed, 
and I went last, dogging the door 
behind. We had three seats across 
the front of that tub — Lotus be- 
tween us two men. I was pilot. 

A floater is a round ball with an 
inner and outer hull, each inde- 
pendent of the other. Thus if you 
ever meet an eighteen-foot bat, you 
can have an outer hull beaten to 
Hell and never feel it inside or let 
it deflect your course, since the in- 
ner one carries the drive engines, 



I pulled back on the stick, lifted 
us and set out for the forest jungle 
that had spread outward from the 
Harrisburg Crater. The screens 
gave us a full view of the ugly 
woods. At the edge were gray-green 
ferns. Later, these gave way to gi- 
ant trees that choked the ferns but 
were equally gray and lifeless- 
looking. 

“You haven’t said what you’ve 
found out about our quarry this 
trip,” Lotus said. 

“It killed Ralph,” Crazy said. 
“That’s all I need to know.” 
“Tell us more,” Lotus said, pull- 
ing the thin membrane of her wings 
about her like a cloak. “Tell us all 
Homer told you.” 

“Mainly, we’re the fifth team to 
be sent after it. Crazy’s brother was 
on the fourth.” 

“The other teams?” Crazy asked. 
“All together, there were twenty- 
two in the other four teams. Twen- 
ty were never seen again.” 

“The other two?” Lotus asked. 
“Rescue parties brought them 
out — in pieces.” 

Below, the world was gray-green. 
Five miles into the forest, I set 
the floater down in a small clear- 
ing. Lotus went ahead to check for 
other clearings and crossings where 
it might be wisest to rig the cam- 
eras and their tiny electric-eye 
triggers. Chances were we’d get a 
wide variety of freaks on film, but 
we should have no trouble picking 
our killer. From the four hazy de- 



142 



IF 




scriptions we had, we knew that he 
was approximately eight feet tall, 
man-like and damnably ugly. There 
were a number of mutants that fit 
the first and last parts of that — 
but few of them were manlike. 
None of the descriptions gave any 
indication of why twenty-two ex- 
perienced bounty hunters had not 
killed it but had been killed in- 
stead. 

Crazy was setting up electric 
eyes, stringing wires back toward 
me and concealing them with fine 
layers of dust. I was rigging the 
cameras in the rocks and bushes. 
Both of us had our backs to the 
same part of the forest. 

And that was a mistake. 

II 

C razy would have heard it first, 
except that he still had his 
hair down over his ears, hindering 
his usually keen hearing. When I 
heard the snapping and low keen- 
ing, it was almost on top of us. 
Whirling, I brought my gun up . 

And up, and up, and up . 
Damn, was it bigl Big and quiet, 
which is a combination we hit more 
often than you might think. It 
stared down through the trees at 
us, thirty feet high, its bulbous 
belly opening over us like a wet, 
wicked mouth — which it was. No 
long, slow throat-to-stomach affair 
here. Just open up and — slurp / 
Spiders make me sick. This one 



made me sicker than usual. There 
were ugly, cancerous scabs all over 
it, pus-coated hairs hanging heav- 
ily from each disease pocket. 

“Don't shoot yet,” I told Crazy. 
But he didn’t have to be told. 
More than once he had seen these 
things react reflexively to a shot, 
leap in and chomp up whatever 
was holding the gun. A big spider 
is not so large as he looks; he is 
mostly spindly legs which can 
squeeze together fast into a little 
ball, to drop him fifteen feet in 
height and let him scuttle in under 
the trees after you. 

“The rocks,” I said quietly, 
watching the multi-prismed eye 
watch me. Very slowly and with 
grace, we edged our way along the 
rocks where I had been setting that 
particular camera. 

The spider watched, swiveling its 
strangely tiny head to follow us, a 
row of fine hairs a-twiddle below 
its eyes. 

The rocks were actually the ruins 
of centuries, tossed here by the A- 
blast that had leveled Harrisburg, 
a provincial capital at that time. It 
was a vast tumble of caves, valleys 
and mountains of bricks and stone 
and powdered mortar. 

Moving a tentative step, the spi- 
der settled long legs through the 
brush with a minimum of noise. It 
keened a bit louder. 

We reached a place where the 
rock broke open tcf form a small 
valley, closing again four hundred 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS 



143 




feet away and forming a dark tun- 
nel that led further into the ruins 
— a tunnel too small for a beast 
like this. “Now,” I whispered. 
“Run!” 

We turned and loped into the 
valley, cutting ourselves off from 
view of the spider. Crazy reached 
the tunnel first. His legs were of- 
ten an asset when speed was needed. 

I was halfway down the valley 
when the spider mounted the one 
valley wall and looked down on us. 
The colossal red eyes glittered ac- 
cusingly. Then the belly appeared, 
mandibles open and clacking. 

Crazy opened fire with his vibra 
pistol, catching one of its legs. The 
beast drew up the wounded mem- 
ber, twiddling it madly. Crazy 
fired again and blew off another 
leg. 

I ran. 

The spider started down into the 
valley 

Crazy shot again, tearing open 
the beast’s side. But spiders are 
tough — and a fist-sized wound 
wasn’t stopping this baby. 

Also, we had too-hastily over- 
looked a very important thing: 
tunnels make nice homes — for 
things. Crazy was raising his pistol 
for a shot at the giant head when 
a pinkish grub-like creature came 
wriggling out of the tunnel in de- 
fense of its abode, casting off three- 
inch, hard thorns. One of these 
struck Crazy’s arm and sent him 
tumbling, his gun lost in the stones. 



he spider keened insanely. 

The grub, suddenly a more 
immediate danger, hissed, arched 
its back and flung itself forward in 
spasmodic lurches that were im- 
mediately followed by the jerking 
release of the sharp quills. I ran to 
Crazy and tried dragging him to 
the walls where the beasts could at- 
tack from only one direction. But 
dragging three hundred and fifty 
pounds was just about impossible. 

I crouched behind Crazy Horse 
and pulled the spine fro mhis arm. 
There was a lot of blood pumping 
out of that arm. I had nothing to 
stop it with, either. I turned to the 
grub, looking for a vulnerable spot. 
Most of his belly was calloused, 
but he always managed to keep the 
first two segments aloft. I aimed 
my vibra pistol there, pulled the 
trigger and held it down. The worm 
went kicking into the air, turning 
over and over, tossing off spines 
that shot over our heads. He crash- 
ed back to the ground when I stop- 
ped firing and was very still. 

But the spider . 

It was at the opposite end of the 
valley now, having used the grub’s 
diversions as a chance to find an 
easy entry. Behind it, anchored to 
the rubble, was a thin web struc- 
ture. It was getting ready to snare 
us. 

Crazy moaned, kicked a foot and 
lapsed into unconsciousness again. 

The spider leaped. 

All those legs just tensed, and it

IF 




was moving through the air, hitting 
the ground and running silently. 

I fired. 

The shot caught it in the legs, 
folding the spindly members up 
under it, and sent it tumbling 
backwards. It lay still so long that 
I thought it dead, but finally it 
stirred, stood, and clung to the 
rubble wall, watching me. I was 
mentally charting all possible path- 
ways of advancement for it, trying 
to anticipate its next move. But I 
didn't expect the silk to come spit- 
ting out like liquid smoke from so 
great a distance. Lazily, it twirled 
toward us. The spider could evi- 
dently direct two of these lines at 
the same time, for two of them ap- 
proached. One struck the wall to 
the left, curling over a rocky pro- 
jection halfway up; the second hit 
at an equal height on the opposite 
wall, lacing through loosely stacked 
rubble and welding its hold into a 
solid position. Then the beast be- 
gan swinging the lines, wrapping 
them back and forth from wall to 
wall, dosing us in. 

I sat on the ground, braced my 
back against Crazy and thumbed 
the controls of the vibra pistol to 
full power. The web dropped over 
us, fouling my hand. I had to spend 
several valuable seconds trying to 
untangle the sticky mess from the 
gun and my fingers. When I raised 
the gun again, the spider had ad- 
vanced fifty feet. I fired. But the 
web was so dense now that it ab- 

WHEftE THE BEAST RUNS 



sorbed the blast and diffused it, 
before dissolving under it. I could 
not dissolve it as fast as the spider 
could make it. 

Another filament dropped across 
my back. Crazy was almost cov- 
ered. 

I shot. 

The web absorbed it. The web 
dissolved. The web was replaced. 
The spider was keening more fran- 
tically than ever, no longer quiet 
in its advance. A sticky strand 
lashed around me, pinning my arms 
to my chest. Another. A third. I 
was being cocooned. The gun drop- 
ped out of my hands as circulation 
was cut down in my arms and my 
hands grew numb. 

A strand crossed my face, foul- 
ing an eye. 

Crazy was invisible beneath 
snowy thread. 

The spider tensed to leap. 

Ill 

T otus was no helpless, frighten- 
^ ed rabbit of a girl when there 
was danger. Lotus was a girl who 
came fluttering over the tree tops 
just as the spider was about to de- 
vour her friends and leaped onto the 
spider without a gun. 

But she had her knife. She kept 
it in her waistband, where only the 
red gem handle showed until she 
had to use it. 

I was pinned by the web, watch- 
ing the hairy black mutant dance 

14 $ 




across the foggy highway it had 
built when she came into view in 
the sky and spotted the action. She 
dipped, swayed with half a second’s 
hesitation, then landed on the 
twisted semi-shoulders behind the 
beast’s head. She tossed her legs 
around that neck, riding it as if it 
were a bronc. It swiveled its eyes, 
trying to catch sight of her, but 
the eyes didn’t revolve far enough. 
Just when they were at the apex 
of their revolution, she drove the 
silver blade Into the left orb, up to 
the crimson hilt, and slashed down- 
ward. 

The spider reared. 

The stream of web fluid ceased 
abruptly, and the beast danced 
backward down the inclined silken 
plane, keening like a thousand 
flutes gone sour. It staggered side- 
ways like a drunk. I wanted to 
shout that it might try to roll over 
on her, but my mouth was blocked 
with fast-drying web, and I could 
not move my arms to clear it away. 

She pulled the knife out and 
found the second eye with it. The 
spider flailed and ran at the cliffs, 
but found it too much trouble to 
climb out and still bear the pain 
that was wracking it. Then it 
rolled . 

“Lotus!” I screamed. But it 
came out a choked whisper, strain- 
ed through the web matting my 
lips. 

But she was flying again, her 
wings beating furiously until they 



had taken her high enough to catch 
the low breezes. They fluffed out 
then and carried her back and forth 
across the chasm, letting her watch 
the spider. 

It died slowly and with lots of 
kicking. Once, I was sure it was 
going to blunder onto the web and 
fall in upon Crazy and me, but it 
never did. When it was down for 
good, Lotus drifted into the web, 
to settle at its edge. “Andy! 
Crazy!” 

I tried to call out. The result 
was a low-key vibration. 

“I hear you! I’ll get you out!” 

I blessed her elongated ears. A 
moment later, she began hacking 
into the web with her knife. In 
time, she reached me and cut away 
the fuzz that bound my arms and 
closed my mouth. Together, we re- 
moved Crazy, ready for the worst. 

B ut it wasn’t that bad at all. 

He was still unconscious, but 
the webbing had matted over the 
spine wound, stopping the bleed- 
ing. 

“We’ll have to take him back,” 
I said. 

“The cameras?” 

“We were only setting up the 
second one.” 

“You finish,” she said. “I check- 
ed ahead. Follow the main trail for 
half a mile and you’ll cross six ma- 
jor intersections. That should give 
us enough coverage to see if the 
beast uses these trails regularly. If 



146 



IF 




you bring the floater here first, I 
can take care of Crazy.” 

“He may be — ” 

“He’ll be okay. There’s enough 
medical supplies in the floater to 
fix him up.” 

She was a good nurse. “Okay,” 
I said. “I’ll be back in a minute.” 
Actually, it was four minutes, but 
when I settled the floater down 
next to the pieces of the web, she 
already had Crazy uncovered and 
clean of the sticky stuff. I took the 
cameras, slung them over my shoul- 
ders and set out — lugging what 
two were meant to carry. I kept my 
gun drawn and an eye out for hairy 
trees . 

Three hours later, I stumbled 
back, worn out and showing it. Lo- 
tus and Crazy were laughing about 
something. “Nice way to get out of 
doing work,” I said. 

Crazy looked up, whinnying that 
silly laugh of his. “You can have 
this arm if you want. I’d rather 
have gone setting the cameras than 
nursing this.” 

“Likely story.” 

“We’d better be getting back,” 
Lotus said. “Looks like a storm, 
and I don’t want to see what might 
come tromping around in the rain.” 
It was a heavy rain that gave 
Fanner II’s vampire plants such 
voracious appetites. 

“Okay. Can you walk at all, 
Crazy. 

“I can manage.” 

“Let’s go.” 



O ne day, the men start looking 
like animals to you . And you 
realize you are allowed to shoot ani- 
mals .. And you realize you are 
just imagining them as animals so 
that you can shoot them and re- 
venge your mother — and maybe 
wipe out that entire chapter of your 
life . Deep down, you think may- 
be you want to spill the blood of 
men, spill it and drink it . 

I must have been moaning in my 
sleep. It was an old and often-felt 
dream. I say that I must have been 
muttering, for when I slipped from 
the dream to the dark reality of 
the bedroom, there was a light body 
against mine, lips on my two, and 
soft, velvet wings enclosing us in 
the closet of our souls . 

The next morning, we went out 
to collect the c|m|ras. Crazy’s arm 
was almost healed, thanks to the 
speedheal salve and bandages. We 
hoped he would be well enough to 
begin the hunt shortly after noon 
in the event the cameras had re- 
corded anything. 

And the camera had. 

“I don’t like it,” Crazy grunted 
as the film loop came across the 
viewer for the sixth time. 

“It isn’t the ugliest we’ve met,” 
I said. It stood seven am? a half 
feet tall and was heavier than Cra- 
zy. Two arms trailed the ground, 
with six-inch claws on them, and 
there was a set of smaller arms in 
the middle of a barrel chest. The 
little hands fiddled with each other, 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS

lacing fingers. The mouth was a 
treasure trove — if you value 
sharp, yellow teeth. It had one 
sunken eye in the left side of its 
face and an undeveloped socket 
where the other one should be. “It 
doesn’t even look as dangerous as 
the spider.” 

“That’s what I mean. I don’t like 
it.” 

“Huh?” 

“I think,” Lotus interrupted, 
“that Crazy means it looks too 
easy. Anything that easy would 
have been knocked out by the first 
team that went after it. It must 
have something else besides claws, 
teeth and an extra pair of hands.” 

“What do you think?” I asked 
her. 

“Can’t say,” Lotus chirped. 
“That would be like stating the 
cause of death before the murder.” 

“What’s the concensus? Should 
we back out of this one?” 

They both voted to go on. 

I smiled and shut off the film 
loop. “Okay. Let’s get started. Cra- 
zy, your arm all right?” 

He peeled off the bandage and 
flexed it. It was swollen but un- 
seamed. “Never felt better. Let’s 
go.” 

IV 

TTTe made camp near the cross- 
* * way where the camera had 
caught him. Lotus took the first 
watch, and I was halfway into the 



second when I heard something of 
more than medium size coming 
along from the right. Unholstering 
my pistol, I stretched out behind 
a heavy row of bushes and waited. 
My infrared goggles filtered out 
the night, giving me a perfect view. 

In a way, I wished it had been 
dark. This fellow looked a lot more 
formidable in person than when 
seen from a camera. The short view 
on the film hadn’t shown the easy 
loping motion of the mutant. I de- 
cided upon his ancestry pretty 
quickly — ape. There had prob- 
ably been a zoo around when the 
big bang wiped out the city and 
its suburbs, a zoo just far enough 
out to be saved. Radiation did the 
rest. He loped by and was gone in 
the darkness. 

I found I was sweating — yet the 
wind was cool. 

I pushed myself up from the 
ground and stepped back to my 
previous waiting post. I was in the 
process of sitting down when I saw, 
from the corner of my eye, that 
the Beast had returned and was 
standing half a dozen yards away, 
squinting at me. I cursed myself 
for forgetting the curiosity and 
cunning of the apes. I hadn’t want- 
ed to try killing him until I had 
studied him a few more times. Now 
I had no choice. 

Suddenly, he started toward me. 

I brought up my pistol and fired 
two blue-white bolts at him. 

But he wasn’t there any longer. 



150 



IF 




He had ducked and taken off be- 
neath. the line of the brush. He 
could have been a hundred yards 
gone or only four feet away. I pan- 
icked. That’s a bad thing to do in 
a strange jungle in the dark with 
a killer Beast prowling around. I 
started backing up, moving toward 
a small, cleared knoll where I imag- 
ined I would have the advantage 
of a better view. 

There was a rustling to my left. 
I fired, but there was no scream. 
I backed faster. My heart was 
throbbing, and the loudness of it 
seemed to reverberate through the 
trees. All other sounds had ceased. 
The fauna knew something was up. 
I kept backing. 

Then I found that the knoll 
wasn’t a knoll at all. The infrared 
goggles were not at fault, for it did 
look like a knoll, even from a dozen 
feet away. But it was a lush, clover- 
like growth that rose to a height of 
five feet in the center, tapering to 
three at the edges of the clearing. 
I turned to move forward, realizing 
the Beast was ahead, waiting. If I 
backed long enough, I would cross 
the small hill and come into the 
safety of our camp. I cursed my- 
self for missing that first shot. 

I was in the middle of the stuff, 
clover up to my middle chest, when 
there was one other sound besides 
my heart thumping — a thick, gut- 
tural snarling. Somewhere, in the 
dense growth, crouched beneath its 
surface, the Beast moved. 



T almost yelled for help. But that 
would have given the Beast a 
fix. Now, he was only prowling, but 
he would come running at the 
sound of my voice. Or at the sound 
of my feet. I couldn’t move and I 
couldn’t yell, and I damn sure 
couldn’t just wait to be discovered. 

Aiming where I thought the noise 
was coming from, I pulled the trig- 
ger. A patch of burned-out clover 
turned steaming and black. Noth- 
ing more. It was impossible to tell 
where in the dense stuff the growl- 
ing was. 

Then he leaped! 

I whirled sideways, spun even 
further and faster as his wicked 
claws tore through my shoulder. 
He crashed into the clover again 
and did not make a sound. I clutch- 
ed my shoulder with my gun hand, 
then realized I would have to keep 
that hand free and let the damn 
wound bleed if it wanted to. 

It wanted to. 

Ape. Damn, clever, agile apel I 
cursed him, gritting my teeth 
against the pain in my shoulder, 
blinking out tears of fury that blot- 
ted my vision. Suddenly, he was 
leaping again. This time I moved 
fast enough. He missed altogether. 

I kept my eyes on the spot his 
hand disappeared into. Slowly, the 
clover began to waver as he moved 
around to the right to spring from 
a different direction. I followed the 
movement of the clover until he 
had positioned himself. I waited. 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS 



151 




He was foxy but not too patient. 
He leaped, and I burned him. He 
fell halfway to me, rolling around 
through the clover. Now, I had the 
upper hand. I moved after him, 
burning off the clover to keep him 
moving. He stood up to run, and I 
shot his left arm. He screamed like 
a kitten at its first bath. 

Then, abruptly, there was black- 
ness . More like a blur. In that 
blur, he was charging me, swiping 
at me, tearing at my side, ripping 
me up and down . 

Much later, when the sun was 
up and the birds were singing, Lo- 
tus poured something warm into 
my mouth and I was waking up to 
the beautiful scene of her face. 
Then Crazy spoiled it by sticking 
his horsey mug into the picture. 
“What happened?” 

I struggled to sit up, managed 
with their help. My head swam, 
settled slowly and was still. “I shot 
it Wounded it, anyway. It tried to 
kill me.” 

“Why didn’t you kill it?” Lotus 
asked. 

“I guess it knocked my gun 
away.” 

“No,” Crazy said. “You had the 
gun clutched in your hand when 
we found you. You must have been 
holding it when he chewed you up. 
Then why didn’t you shoot it 
again?” 

T tried to remember. I could pic- 
A tore the blue-white vibra beam 



tearing open the night. There was 
some sort of exclamation — ev- 
idently from me — and I could no 
longer shoot. It was limping at me, 
bleeding badly, but I could not pull 
the trigger. I didn’t want to pull 
the trigger! I explained the mem- 
ories as I recalled them. 
“Hypnosis?” Crazy asked. 

“I don’t think so. I wasn’t spell- 
bound. Something . something 
else.” 

“I think we should back out 
now,” Lotus said. “I think we 
should pack our gear and move out 
fast.” 

“No,” I said, trying to look more 
chipper than I felt. “We’ll get it. I 
know we’ll get it.” 

“But there are other jobs — eas- 
ier jobs,” she protested. 

“We’ve shed our blood for this 
one,” Crazy said. “When you spill 
your blood for a hunt, you’re bound 
to get the beast no matter what.” 
She fluttered her soft blue wings, 
looking right through me as only 
she can do. “It’s more than that to 
you, isn’t it, Andy?” 

“Yes,” I croaked. “Yes, I sup- 
pose it is. Though I don’t know 
what.” Then I passed out. 




the Beast since, though we were 
not inexperienced enough to think 
it had crawled away to die. We de- 
cided, instead, that it had returned 
to its lair, somewhere in the forest,

to heal itself. We had ceased to 
speculate about why I had been 
unable to kill it when I had the 
chance, for that was not a happy 
thing to speculate about. There 
were too many bad dreams in some- 
thing like that. 

Leaving everything that could 
not be carried easily, we struck out 
with inflatable mattresses, food, 
water and guns. Most of all, guns. 
After establishing what our quar- 
ry’s footprints were like — human- 
ish, four-toed, with long and wicked 
nails tipping each toe — from a set 
that led away from the fight scene 
in a limp pattern, we set off deeper 
into the woods. On the second day 
of the march, we found where it 
had fallen and had lain for some 
time until it found the strength to 
go on. On the third day, we tracked 
it to the lip of the Harrisburg Cra- 
ter — where the footprints ceased. 

We stood there on the rim of the 
vast depression, staring across the 
table of nuclear glass that the tri- 
ple-headed super-nuclear rocket 
had made. The crater, I knew from 
the maps, was two and a quarter 
miles in diameter. That was a lot 
of space. Dotting it were thousands 
of bubbles of glass. A number of 
them were broken and led to the 
maze of caves that lay under the 
floor of the crater. Apparently, in 
one of those caves, the beast was 
licking its wounds — and waiting. 

“How can we cover all that?” 
Crazy asked. 



“We’ll do it,” I said. I didn’t 
want to do it. I didn’t know why I 
didn’t order everyone to back 
track, to get the hell out of there. 
Lotus was right, of course; the rea- 
son was more than revenge against 
a dumb animal. For a moment, I 
felt like Hamlet on the castle ram- 
parts, talking to a ghost. But that 
feeling passed. My determination 
had something to do with that 
night when I could have killed it 
and didn’t, when I almost let it kill 
me. And why? Why had it killed 
twenty-two others? 

“I guess here is as good a place 
as any,” Lotus said. “Let’s make 
camp here.” She swung a hand 
around, indicating the thirty feet 
of hard-packed earth that separated 
the forest from the crater edge. 
Here and there, a few sparse pieces 
of vegetation were trying to grow 
on the no-plant’s-land between 
woods and glass. They weren’t do- 
ing too well, but they made the 
bleakness a little less bleak. 

“Here it is,” I said, dropping my 
own gear. “We’ll start to search the 
caves tomorrow.” 

Nightfall drifted in — a black 
fog. 

There were stars in the sky, but 
the greatest light show of all lay at 
our feet. For two and one quarter 
miles ahead, the nuclear glass 
shimmered with vibrant colors, giv- 
ing off the heat of day. Blue 
chased reds across its surface while 
ambers danced with oranges. 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS 



153 




T was sitting on the edge of the 
crater, dangling my legs, a hun- 
dred yards or so from the camp- 
site. Crazy was back there, still 
eating supper. His suppers lasted 
two hours. Lotus drifted down next 
to me, folded her tiny legs under 
her and put her head on my shoul- 
der. Her hair was cool and sweet- 
smelling. It was as black as the 
night and blew around my ears and 
chin and made me feel good. 

"Beautiful, isn’t it,” I said. 
Ibere was a burst of orange rim- 
med with silver to the right. 

"Very,” she said as she tried to 
orawl closer. She was our consola- 
tion. She held the team together. 
Crazy and I could not have lasted 
a month without her. Briefly, I 
wondered at her and Crazy; he 
was so big and clumsy, while she 
was so tiny, so fragile. But she 
never came back cracked or chip- 
ped, so maybe the lummox was 
gentler than he seemed. 

"You scared?” I asked. She was 
trembling, and it was not cold. 

"You know me.” 

"We’ll win. We’re the good 
guys.” 

I felt something wet on my neck, 
and I knew it was a tear. I shifted 
a little and cuddled her and mut- 
tered soothing platitudes. But 
mainly, I just sat there being un- 
comfortable and damned happy all 
at once. Lotus almost never cried. 
When she did, she was worried 
about one of us — I mean really 



worried — and then she couldn’t 
stop until she was dried out. I 
could only sit and hold her. 

So she was crying. 

And I was cuddling. 

And, suddenly, Crazy was 
screaming! 

V 

A very long time ago, as I had 
sat at an upstairs window be- 
fore my mother made me leave our 
house, there had come two giant 
red eyes out of the night mists. 
They had been as large as saucers, 
casting scarlet light ahead of them, 
focusing on the house. It was a 
jeep covered with sheets and red 
cellophane and painted to look like 
a dragon by the Knights of the 
Dragon to Preserve Humanity. I 
thought it very funny that grown 
people should play at such games. 

Now, below me in the pit that 
had suddenly opened and swal- 
lowed Crazy, a spider, spindly legs 
bracing it a hundred feet down, 
was looking up with crimson head- 
lamp eyes. Only, there was some- 
thing worse than a jeep behind 
these orbs. 

"Crazy!” I shouted. 

"Here. Toward the left! ” 

I took the lantern Lotus brought 
from the camp and lowered it into 
the steeply sloping tunnel. The spi- 
der backed off another fifty feet. 
Branching off from the main fall 
were several side tunnels, all filled 



154 



IF 




with eggs and sticky webbing. 

*It must have burrowed close to 
tile surface,” Crazy shouted. “I 
just stepped on the ground and it 
gave away under me.” 

He had rolled into one of the 
tunnels and was caught up in 
the stickiness and the eggs. The 
mother spider fidgeted below, want- 
ftig to come charging up, frightened 
only for the moment. “Lotus, 
dimbing cleats — and your knife. 
Hurry!” 

She lifted away and was back al- 
most instantly. I slipped the cleat 
attachments onto my boots and 
took her knife to cut steps into the 
tunnel wall. “I'm coming down, 
Crazy.” 

“What about the spider?” 

“She looks scared.” 

“She’ll get over that. Stay out.” 
“Crazy, you’re nuts.” I crawled 
down into the sloping cave, hating 
to turn my back on the spider but 
unable to negotiate the steep pas- 
sage head first. 

The red eyes watched. They 
never blinked. They had no lids. 

I reached the side cave where 
Crazy was trapped, with dirt pack- 
ed so tightly under my fingernails 
that they ached. I hacked away the 
web, balled it up and stuffed it be- 
hind him. I didn’t want to drop it 
down the main shaft for fear the 
jOit would bring her flailing up- 
ward, stomach open. When I had 
his head and arms free, he was able 
to help himself. 



“You first,” I said. “Can you 
make it up?” 

“These hooves give perfect bal- 
ance.” He kicked out of the egg 
pocket and started up the incline. 
I waited until he was almost out, 
then launched myself on the climb. 
But all this action had shaken the 
mother spider to action. I could 
hear the scuttling of her feet com- 
ing up fast. 

“I can’t shoot, Andy!” Lotus 
shouted. “You’re in the way!” 

T started to say something when 
-*■ the furry legs touched me 
around the waist and pulled me 
loose. But the spider wasn’t pre- 
pared for all my weight. She wob- 
bled and collapsed. We both plung- 
ed down the slope, twisted around 
a bend — all her legs kicking fur- 
iously — and dropped twenty feet 
onto a cavern floor. 

I was on top of the spider. 

She was screaming. Then, de- 
spite the pounding of my heart, I 
could hear that most of the screams 
were echoes, cast back by the walls 
of the great stone chamber. 

I felt something wet, scrambled 
for a hand hold on the flailing 
beast and looked down. My foot 
was dangling inside her stomach! 
She had rolled onto her back, and 
I was mounted on her deadly un- 
der-side. The mandibles quivered. 
I jerked the foot back and discov- 
ered the knife still clutched in my 
hand. 



WHERE THE BEAST RUNS

The head reared up as she tried 
to throw me off. I struck for the 
eye, pulled back the blade and was 
rewarded with gushing blood. She 
screamed louder, rolling about. I 
was tossed free, to crouch behind 
a large boulder. 

The spider did her death dance, 
and then stilled, her flashing legs 
awkwardly akimbo. 

I remained behind the rocks, 
clutching an arm that ached, too 
afraid to look at it until I saw that 
the beast was dead and she would 
not be rushing me. It took her 
some time to expire, but she did so 
with a great amount of frothing. 
When I looked at my arm, I could 
see the reason for pain; a small 
piece of white bone was sticking 
through the flesh, white and spot- 
ted with blood. My head was swim- 
ming, and I suddenly felt more 
than a thousand years old. 

Above, from the tunnel that the 
spider and I had fallen through, I 
could hear a noisy scuffling. My 
head spun even faster, and visions 
of the beasts mate swam through 
my head, magnifying my fears. I 
got to my feet. I felt as if I were 
walking on a cushion of air. My 
eyes were burning coals someone 
had dropped into my sockets, while 
my head was a block of melting 
ice. I staggered out of the large 
cavern, moving to a tunnel that 
glittered with light at its end, hop- 
ing that this — in some way — 
would lead me out. 



The stones seemed to melt and 
reform around me. My teeth chat- 
tered in my ice head. I perspired. 

The end of the tunnel was a 
branching-off place where the walls 
turned to glass and wound errati- 
cally off under the floor of the vast 
crater. Turquoise and crimson ceil- 
ings flashed over me. The walls 
were tinted mirrors. Reality was 
pushed even further from my mind, 
and delusion and fever grew strong- 
er. I moved to the right. 

My arm had become a flaming 
tree, its roots grown deep into my 
chest, constricting my lungs. Pant- 
ing, I moved on through the wind- 
ing glass corridors, sane enough to 
know who I was and that I must 
get out, but just delirious enough 
to not think of turning back and 
working along the route I had cov- 
ered. In this manner, I came across 
the Beast in its lair. 

'T'he tunnel ended in a room 
where grasses had been drag- 
ged in, and there was rotting flesh 
from past meals strewn on the 
floor. There was a natural stairway, 
uneven but usable, breaking one 
wall. It led to the ceiling where a 
half-moon aperture offered escape 
to the crater floor overhead. But 
lying between that escape route 
and me was the Beast. And, though 
dying, he was not dead. 

I stopped, swaying crazily. The 
Beast was watching me from where 
he lay, his massive head raised

from the floor, his single red eye 
a hideous lantern, bright even in 
this glittering room of fantasy 
walls. He grunted and tried to 
move. His leg was a mess. That 
was the work of my first shot. He 
shoved his other leg under himself 
and pulled into a sitting position, 
all weight on one arm and his good 
leg. He snarled. I saw that he was 
going to leap. 

I looked about for a chunk of 
loose glass and found one the size 
of my fist. I bent, picked it up and 
weighed it. I brought my healthy 
arm back, to heave it at the Beast’s 
head. It struck his chest instead, 
knocking him on his behind. He 
struggled to a sitting position while 
I searched for another rock. 

The walls glittered, seeming to 
recede and quickly approach me 
when I moved too much . 

I found a sharp-edged piece and 
brought it back to throw. 

And he spoke. “Make Caesar 
shut up!” he said. “Make him shut 
up!” 

I almost dropped the rock. The 
walls wiggled crazily. The Beast re- 
peated the thing, over and over. 
Then he leaped. 

The force of his impact was not 
,as great as it might have been had 
he been able to use both feet to 
propel himself. Still, he bowled me 
over. He raked claws down the side 
of my face as we rolled. I kicked 
free mid rolled across the floor to 
the far wall. Above was the exit 



“Andy!” Lotus and Crazy ap- 
peared at the entrance to the room. 
It had been they, not the spider’s 
mate, who had been scrambling 
down that tunnel! 

“Make Caesar shut up!” the 
beast recited. “Make him shut up!” 

The two of them froze. Crazy 
had a gun drawn and was about to 
fire. Now he left the gun dangling 
loosely in his fingers. 

“Kill it!” I shouted. 

“It’s intelligent,” Lotus said, 
rubbing her tiny hands together. 

“It is like hell!” Panting as I 
was, I must have sounded more 
like an animal than the Beast. “It 
killed Ralph, Crazy!” 

Crazy flinched, looking very dis- 
tressed. “It’s more man than ani- 
mal,” he said, his gun hanging use- 
lessly in his hand. 

“It got that phrase from mel” I 
shouted. “I said that when I shot 
it in the woods. It must have been 
speaking then — something it 
picked up from a previous bounty 
hunter — mid I thought it was in- 
telligent. That’s why I couldn’t 
shoot it. Man cannot kill man. But 
this is a Beast! Nothing more. A 
myna bird.” 

“It got that phrase from me!” 
the Beast shouted, struggling across 
the floor toward me, throwing a 
few cautious looks behind at Lotus 
and Crazy. 

“See!” 

“See!” it mocked me. 

Lotus grabbed the gun from

Crazy and aimed. But she could 
not fire. “Here, Andy I” She tossed 
the gun to me, over the Beast. It 
clattered against the wall five feet 
away. Wearily, I inched after it. 

And the Beast was on me. He 
tore at me with his reserve of 
strength, the strength he had been

saving to meet death with. I felt 
blood pumping out of my back as 
his claws raked it. His foul breath 
swept over me. 

I kicked out with a last ounce of 
strength. My boot caught him on 
the chin and stunned him. My fin- 
gers slipped over the gun. Bringing 
it around, with the barrel centered 
on the brutish face, I choked as 
my finger pressed the trigger. 

“See!” he shouted, reaching a 
long, hairy arm out for me. 

Strange scenes of a house on fire, 
of a woman burning, of people 
turning into animals, flashed 
through my mind. Then I pulled 
the trigger. I saw his face go up in 
a red fountain and collapsed back- 
ward into darkness. 

\T7hen I came to, it was to see 
* * a blue sky overhead, trees 
flashing by on both banks, and 
blue water underneath. Crazy had 
broken the top from one of the 
glass bubbles and had used it as a 
boat, placing it in the small river 
that drifted through Congressman 
Horner’s ranch. This would be a 
much swifter route than that by 
which we had come. 

“How are you feeling?” Lotus 
asked. 

“Relieved,” I croaked. 

“I know,” she said, running a 
cool hand over my forehead. 

“No, you don’t,” I said, turning 
my head to the glass bottom where 
the water revealed its depth. My 
own depths were purged. END

SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 
(Continued from page 98) 
time was no exception. “Perhaps,” 
I reflected with growing enthusi- 
asm, rt we can drown D’Cela’s forts.” 
Leaving the larger of our two 
ships to guard D’Cela, I raced back 
to New Enithra with some hope of 
end to the D’Cela problem. Both 
human and Ayorian scientists, now 
working in teams, were asked, “Can 
the gravity field be made direc- 
tional over an area equal to that of 
D’Cela’s forts?” 

The humans, looking like gigan- 
tic bugs because of the goggles en- 
abling them to see the Ayor, an- 
swered in the affirmative. 

‘°Will the energy of gravity pass 
through both the physical and tele- 
kinetic barriers?” 

Again the answer was yes. 

What I had in mind was simple 
enough. D’Cela’s fortress had a 
thin double skin made with exceed- 
ingly dense metal. Such dense 
structures, especially when con- 
structed in strong gravity-wells, 
needed special flotation platforms 
to keep them from sinking through 
the planet’s less dense bed-rock. 
With the gravity generator, we 
should be able to upset the delicate 
balance of those floatation plat- 
forms, causing the fortress to sink 
naturally and completely through 
the planet’s composition. 

I returned to D’Cela’s final re- 
treat with the modified equipment, 
and we increased the apparent mass 



of the fort in steep exponential pro- 
gression. It sank toward the plan- 
et’s center as though falling through 
a hard-vacuum column we were 
fortunate to escape the explosion 
which resulted, causing the planet’s 
crust to be tom away in cascades 
of fire. 

On approaching the fortress on 
the planet’s opposite side, we soon 
sensed both the absence of humans 
and the quick popping of small hy- 
per-driven ships as they snapped 
into hyper-space. 

Would we never catch this evil 
man? 

R ational logic dictated that we 
quit the chase since there was 
no known way of either tracing or 
catching D’Cela in hyper-space. 
Billions of stars might serve as his 
coming-out point. 

But my emotions were not ra- 
tional and I drove myself and all 
others to find the means by which 
D’Cela could be destroyed. My 
need for revenge drove me as no 
Ayorian had ever been driven. 

The nearest galaxy was 1.5 X 
10 6 light-years distant from Feren’s 
sun. Under hyper-drive, flight time 
would fill six weeks, were he to 
choose that direction. This would 
be my maximum time for solution 
to two major problems — first, to 
exceed D’Cela’s hyper-driven veloc- 
ity and second, to develop a means 
for locating his ships while still on 
hyper-drive. 



SPORK CONQUERS CIVILIZATION 



159 




Driven mostly by emotions, I 
felt instinctively convinced that we 
could solve these two problems. 
There was first the clue that hyper- 
drive phenomenon was crudely re- 
lated to our natural indirect action 
faculties. Next was the fact that no 
time accrued during our organical- 
ly induced teleportation, while time 
did accrue under the mechanical 
variety. 

Those children who were deeply 
engrossed in their personal twin- 
ning problems could not be dis- 
suaded from their tasks, but all oth- 
ers were pushed and prodded as 
never before into study of the prob- 
lems. And within a matter of days, 
we had our first breakthrough and 
within hours we had our first po- 
tential solution. 

When the adults reached into 
the hyper-drive field under their 
highest power of sensitivity, they 
were able to observe or sense a kind 
of “wake,” sub-nucleonic in char- 
acter. As the field moved, the wake 
left a fine trail of asymmetrically 
arranged sub-particles. In time, 
they dissipated; but they lasted 
long enough to provide the trace 
of D’Cela’s ships. 

When a smaller hyper-drive gen- 
erator was placed inside the field 
of another generator, relative ve- 
locity was increased by a power fac- 
tor of two for the total assemblage. 
In theory, an endless number of 
generators placed one within an- 
other would provide mechanically 



induced “instant” travel, like that 
which we already enjoyed by means 
of our natural faculties. Practical 
considerations enabled only one 
power boost, and even then the 
linkage worked for only small ob- 
jects. 

But we had our solution I Tied 
to the dissipating wake of D’Cela’s 
ships were small nuclear explosives 
which moved ever-doser to each of 
his ships in the ratio of one number 
to its square power. Wherever and 
whenever the wake terminated, in- 
dicating the normal space position 
of his ship, our explosive would 
perform satisfactorily and the re- 
sulting blast would loose enough 
free energy to destroy any ship. 

X 

B y now I was well aware of the 
fundamental differences be- 
tween even two beings of the same 
biological stock. The Tepen, though 
derived from Ayorian stock, were 
all evil; D’Cela and his men were 
derived from human stock and 
they, too, were mostly evil. 

Probably on any planet there 
were both evil and good stock, so 
I could not truly condemn the 
whole human race for the actions 
of a small number, anymore then 
I could blame all Ayorians for the 
action of the Tepen. 

But what of cultural and con- 
trol institutions? The Ayorian had 
never allowed themselves to be 

IF 



160 





“AH alliance with other human 
groups will be approved only 
through the Ayor, as well as growth 
or preparation of military efforts.” 
How these humans felt about my 
ultimatum was unimportant, since 
I was fully determined to protect 
my race. Never again would more 
than sixty thousand of my brethren 
be destroyed by the idle whim of 
some mad human. Therefore I, 
Spork the Ayorian moron, Spork 
the Tepen avenger, Spork the beast 
enslaver, now became Spork, ruler 
of the Quations planetary system! 

END 



controlled by evil, choosing to die 
rather then to succumb to that 
which was against their natural na- 
ture. How did the humans of Feren 
allow themselves to be so con- 
trolled? 

If we Ayorians were successfully 
to colonize the empty planets of 
the Ferenian planetary system, we 
would have great need for peace. 
Could we ever have peace if the 
humans were to continually allow 
might to rule right? 

With an almost paranoiac, pas- 
sionate feeling for detail, we check- 
ed planet six to insure no further 
dangers and I gave thought far 
ahead to our future. My emotions, 
once boiling against D’Cela and his 
murder of thousands of my breth- 
ren, now transferred to a determin- 
ation that security, would be estab- 
lished for my people. 

We landed on Feren to be met 
by a large government delegation; 
when the empty speeches were 
through and the banquet ended, I 
explained to all the kind of gov- 
ernment I had in mind. “From this 
day forward,” I said, “this plane- 
tary system shall be considered un- 
der the dominion of the Ayor. 

“Should the humans of Feren 
wish to continue self-rule of their 
planet, they will be free to do so 
— so long as no evil men or evil 
systems are allowed to take root, 
restricting the principles of individ-
