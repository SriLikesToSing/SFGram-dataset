GLEANERS 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



I 



H e went sneaking past the 
door. 

The lettering on the door 
said: Executive Vice Presi- 
dent y Projects, 

And down in the lower left 
corner, Hallock Spencer, in 
very modest type. 

That was him. He was Hal- 
lock Spencer. 

But he wasn't going in that 
door. He had trouble enough 
already without going in. 
There'd be people waiting 
there for him. No one in par- 
ticular — but people. And each 
of them with problems. 

He ducked around the corn- 
er and went a step or two 
down the corridor until he 
came to another door that said 
Private on it. 

It was unlocked. He went 

in. 

A dowdy scarecrow in a 
faded, dusty toga sat tipped 
back in a chair, with his san- 
dalled feet resting on Hallock 
Spencer's desk top. He wore 
a mouse-gray woolen cap upon 



his hairless skull and his ears 
stuck out like wings. A short 
sword, hanging from the belt 
that snugged in the toga, 
stood canted with its point 
resting on the carpet. There 
was dirt beneath his rather 
longish toenails and he hadn't 
shaved for days. He was a 
total slob. 

‘‘Hello, E.J.," said Spencer. 

The man in the toga didn't 
take his feet off the desk. He 
didn't move at all. He just 
sat there. 

“Sneaking in again," he 
said. 

Spencer put down his brief- 
case and hung up his hat. 

“The reception room's a 
trap," he said. 

He sat down in the chair 
behind the desk and picked up 
the project schedule and had 
a look at it. 

“What's the trouble, E.J.?" 
he asked. “You back already?" 

“Haven't started yet. Not 
for another couple hours." 

“It says here," said Spen- 
cer, flicking the schedule with 
a finger, “that you're a Roman 
trader." 



6 




Past, Inc., changed a lot of minds about 
time. Everyone knew time was money — but 
did it have to be millions and millions? 






“That’s what I am,” said 
E.J. “At least, Costumes says 
so. I hope to God they’re 
right.” 

“But the sword — ” 
“Pardner,” said E.J., “back 
in Roman Britain, out on a 
Roman road, with a pack train 
loaded down with goods, a 
man has got to carry steel.” 

H e reached down and 
hoisted the sword into 
his lap. He regarded it with 
disfavor. “But I don’t mind 
telling you it’s no great shakes 
of a weapon.” 

“I suppose you’d feel safer 
with a tommy gun.” 

E.J. nodd^ glumly. “Yes. 
I would.” 

“Lacking that,” said Spen- 
cer, “we do the best we can. 
You’ll pack the finest steel in 
the second century. If that is 
any comfort.” 

E.J. just sat there with the 
sword across his lap. He was 
making up his mind to say 
something — it was written on 
his face. He was a silly-look- 
ing soul, with all those wiry 
whiskers and his ears way out 
to either side of him and the 
long black hairs that grew out 
of the lobes. 

“Hal,” said E.J., finally 
making up his mind, “I want 
out of this.” 

Spencer stiffened in his 
chair. “You can’t do that!” he 
yelled. “Time is your very life. 
You’ve been in it for a lot of 
years!” 

“I don’t mean out of Time. 



I mean out of Family Tree. I 
am sick of it.” 

“You don’t know what 
you’re saying,” Spencer pro- 
tested. “Family Tree’s not 
tough. You’ve been on a lot 
of worse ones. Family Tree’s 
a snap. All you have to do is 
go back and talk to people or 
maybe check some records. 
You don’t have to snitch a 
thing.” 

“It’s not the work,” said 
E.J. “Sure, the work is easy. 
I don’t mind the work. It’s 
after I get back.” 

“You mean the Wrightson- 
Graves.” 

“That is what I mean. After 
every trip, she has me up to 
that fancy place of hers and 
I have to tell her all about her 
venerable ancestors ...” 

Spencer said, “It’s a valu- 
able account. We have to serv- 
ice it.” 

“I can’t stand much more 
of it,” E.J. insisted, stub- 
bornly. 

Spencer nodded. He knew 
just what E.J. meant. He felt 
much the same. 

Alma Wrightson-Graves 
was a formidable old dowager 
with a pouter-pigeon build 
and the erroneous conviction 
that she still retained much of 
her girlish charm. She was 
loaded down with cash, and 
also with jewels that were too 
costly and gaudy to be good 
taste. For years she’d shriek- 
ed down and bought off every- 
one around her until she firm- 
ly believed there was notiiing

in the world she couldn't have 
— if she was willing to pay 
enough for it. 

And she was paying plenty 
for this family tree of hers. 
Spencer had often asked him- 
self just why she wanted it. 
Back to the Conquest, sure — 
that made at least some sense. 
But not back to the caves. Not 
that Past, Inc., couldn’t trace 
it that far for her if her cash 
continued to hold out. He 
thought, with a perverted sat- 
isfaction, that she couldn’t 
have been happy with the last 
report or two, for the family 
had sunk back to abject peas- 
antry. 

He said as much to E.J. 
“What does she want?’’ he 
asked. “What does she ex- 
pect?” 

“I have a hunch,” E.J. told 
him, “that she has some hopes 
we’ll find a connection back to 
Rome. God help us if we do. 
Then it could go on forever.” 

Spencer grunted. 

“Don’t be too sure,” warn- 
ed E.J. “Roman officers being 
what they were I wouldn’t bet 
against it.” 

“If that should happen,” 
Spencer told him, “I’ll take 
you off the project. Assign 
someone else to carry out the 
Roman research. I’ll tell the 
Wrightson-Graves you’re not 
so hot on Rome — have a men- 
tal block or a psychic allergy 
or something that rejects in- 
doctrination.” 

“Thanks a lot," said E.J., 
without much enthusiasm. 



O NE by one, he took his 
dirty feet off the shiny 
desk and rose out of the chair. 
“E.J.?” 

“Yes, Hal." 

“Just wondering. Have you 
ever hit a place where you 
felt that you should stay? 
Have you ever wondered if 
maybe you should stay?” 
“Yeah, I guess so. Once or 
twice, perhaps. But I never 
did. You’re thinking about 
Garson.” 

“Garson for one. And all 
the others.” 

“Maybe something happen- 
ed to him. You get into tight 
spots. It’s a simple matter to 
make a big mistake. Or the 
operator might have missed.” 
“Our operators never miss,” 
snapped Spencer. 

“Garson was a good man,” 
said E.J., a little sadly. 

“Garson ! It’s not only Gar- 
son. It’s all the ...” Spencer 
stopped abruptly, for he’d run 
into it again. After all these 
years, he still kept running 
into it. No matter how he 
tried, it was something to 
which he could not reconcile 
himself — the disparity in 
time. 

He saw that E.J. was star- 
ing at him, with just the 
slightest crinkle that was not 
quite a smile at the corner of 
his mouth. 

“You can’t let it eat you,” 
said E.J. “You’re not respon- 
sible. We take our chances. 
If it wasn’t worth our 
while .

"Oh, shut up!” said Spen- 
cer. 

“Sure,” said E.J., “you lose 
one of us every now and then. 
But it’s no worse than any 
other business.” 

“Not one every now and 
then,” said Spencer. “There 
have been three of them in the 
last ten days.” 

“Well, now,” said E.J., “I 
lose track of them. There was 
Garson just the other day. 
And Taylor — how long ago 
was that?” 

“Four days ago,” said Spen- 

CGI*. 

“Four days,” said E.J., 
astonished. “Is that all it 
was?” 

Spencer snapped, “For you 
it was three months or more. 
And do you remember Price? 
For you that was a year ago, 
but just ten days for me.” 
E.J. put up a dirty paw 
and scrubbed at the bristle 
on his chin. 

“How time does fly!” 
“Look,” said Spencer, mis- 
erably, “this whole set-up is 
bad enough. Please don’t make 
jokes about it.” 

“Garside been giving you a 
hard time, maybe? Losing too 
many of the men?” 

“Hell, no,” said Spencer, 
bitterly. “You can always get 
more men. It’s the machines 
that bother him. He keeps 
reminding me they cost a 
quarter million.” 

E.J. made a rude sound 
with his lips. 

“Get out of here!” yelled 



Spencer. “And see that you 
come home!” 

E.J. grinned and left. He 
gave the toga a girlish flirt as 
he went out the door. 

II 

S PENCER told himself E.J. 

was wrong. For whatever 
anyone might say, he, Hallock 
Spencer, was responsible. He 
ran the stinking show. He 
made up the schedules. He as- 
signed the travelers and he 
sent them out. When there 
were mistakes or hitches, he 
was the one who answered. 
To himself, if no one else. 

He got up and paced the 
floor, hands locked behind his 
back. 

Three men in the last ten 
days. And what had happened 
to them? 

Possibly there was some- 
thing to what Garside said, 
as well — Christopher Anson 
Garside, chief co-ordinator 
and a nasty man to handle, 
with his clipped, gray mus- 
tache and his clipped, gray 
voice and his clipped, gray 
business thinking. 

For it was not men alone 
who did not come back. It was 
likewise the training and ex- 
perience you had invested in 
those men. They lasted, Spen- 
cer told himself, a short time 
at the best without managing 
to get themselves killed off 
somewhere in the past, or de- 
ciding to squat down and set- 
tle in some other era they 



10 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




liked better than the present. 

And the machines were 
something that could not be 
dismissed. Every time a man 
failed to return it meant an- 
other carrier lost. And the 
carriers did cost a quarter 
million — which wasn't some- 
thing you could utterly forget. 

Spencer went back to his 
desk and had another look at 
the schedule for the day. 
There was E.J., bound for 
Roman Britain on the Family 
Tree project; Nickerson go- 
ing back to the early Italian 
Renaissance to check up once 
again on the missing treasure 
in the Vatican; Hennessy off 
on his search once more for 
the lost documents in fifteenth 
century Spain; Williams go- 
ing out, he hoped, finally to 
snatch the mislaid Picasso, 
and a half dozen more. Not a 
massive schedule. But enough 
to spell out a fairly busy day. 

He checked the men not on 
the projects list. A couple of 
them were on vacation. One 
was in Rehabilitation. Indoc- 
trination had the rest of them. 

He sat there, then, for the 
thousandth time, wondering 
what it would be like, really, 
to travel into time. 

He'd heard hints of it from 
some of the travelers, but no 
more than hints, for they did 
not talk about it. Perhaps they 
did among themselves, when 
there were no outsiders pres- 
ent. Perhaps not even then. 
As if it were something that 
no man could quite describe. 



As if it were an experience 
that no man should discuss. 

A haunting sense of unre- 
ality, the feeling that one was 
out of place, a hint of not 
quite belonging, of somehow 
standing, tip-toe, on the far 
edge of eternity. 

It wore off after a time, of 
course, but apparently one 
was never entirely free of it. 
For the past, in some mys- 
terious working of a principle 
yet unknown, was a world of 
wild enchantment. 

Well, he had had his chance 
and flunked it. 

But some day, he told him- 
self, he would go into time. 
Not as a regular traveler, but 
as a vacationist — if he could 
snatch the necessary time to 
get ready for the trip. The 
trip, itself, of course, was no 
consideration so far as time 
might be concerned. It was 
Indoctrination and the brief- 
ing that was time-consuming. 

He picked up the schedule 
again for another look. All of 
those who were going back 
this day were good men. There 
was no need to worry about 
any one of them. 

H e laid the schedule to one 
side and buzzed Miss 
Crane. 

Miss Crane was a letter- 
perfect secretary, though she 
wasn't much to look at. She 
was a leathery old maid. She 
had her own way of doing 
things, and she could act very 
disapproving. 



GLEANERS

No choice of his, Spencer 
had inherited her fifteen years 
before. She had been with 
Past, Inc., before there was 
even a projects office. And, 
despite her lack of looks, her 
snippy attitude and her gen- 
erally pessimistic view of life, 
she was indispensable. 

She knew the projects job 
as well as he did. At times 
she let him know it. But she 
never forgot, never mislaid, 
never erred; she ran an effi- 
cient office, always got her 
work done and it always was 
on time. 

Spencer, dreaming at times 
of a lusher young replace- 
ment, knew that he was no 
more than dreaming. He 
couldn’t do his job without 
Miss Crane in the outer office. 

“You sneaked in again,” 
she accused him as soon as 
she’d closed the door. 

“I suppose there’s someone 
waiting.” 

“There’s a Dr. Aldous 
Ravenholt,” she said. “He’s 
from Foundation for Human- 
ity.” 

Spencer flinched. There was 
no one worse to start a morn- 
ing with than some pompous 
functionary from Humanity. 
They almost always figured 
that you owed them some- 
thing. They thought the whole 
world owed them something. 

“And there’s a Mr. Stewart 
Cabell. He’s an applicant sent 
up by Personnel. Mr. Spencer, 
don’t you think . .” 

“No, I don’t,” Spencer snap- 



ped at her. “I know Person- 
nel is sore. But I’ve been tak- 
ing everyone they’ve been 
shoveling up here and see 
what happens. Three men 
gone in the last ten days. 
From now on. I’m taking a 
close look at everyone myself.” 

She sniffed. It was a very 
nasty sniff. 

“That all?” asked Spencer, 
figuring that he couldn’t be 
that lucky — just two of them. 

“Also there’s a Mr. Boone 
Hudson. He’s an elderly man 
who looks rather ill and he 
seems impatient. Perhaps you 
should see him first.” 

Spencer might have, but not 
after she said that. 

“I’ll see Ravenholt,” he said. 
“Any idea what he wants?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Well, send him in,” said 
Spencer. “He’ll probably want 
to chisel a slice of Time off 
me.” 

Chiselers, he thought. I 
didn’t know there were so 
many chiselers ! 

Aldous Ravenholt was a 
pompous man, well satisfied 
and smug. You could have but- 
tered bread with the crease in 
his trousers. His handshake 
was professional and he had 
an automatic smile. He sat 
down in the chair that Spen- 
cer offered him with a self- 
assurance that was highly 
irritating. 

“I came to talk with you,” 
he said precisely, “about the 
pending proposal to investi- 
gate religious origins.” 



12 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




Spencer winced mentally. It 
was a tender subject. 

"Dr. Ravenholt,” he said, 
"that is a matter I have given 
a great deal of attention. Not 
myself alone, but my entire 
department.” 

"That is what I’ve heard,” 
Ravenholt said drily. "That 
is why I’m here. I understand 
you have tentatively decided 
not to go ahead with it.” 

"Not tentatively,” said 
Spencer. “Our decision has 
been made. I’m curious how 
you heard it.” 

R avenholt waved an 
airy hand, implying there 
was very little he did not 
know about. “I presume the 
matter still is open to discus- 
sion.” 

Spencer shook his head. 
Ravenholt said, icily, “I fail 
to see how you could summar- 
ily cut off an investigation so 
valid and so vital to all hu- 
manity.” 

"Not summarily. Dr. Rav- 
enholt. We spent a lot of time 
on it. We made opinion sam- 
plings. We had an extensive 
check by Psych. We consid- 
ered all the factors.” 

“And your findings, Mr. 
Spencer?” 

“First of all,” said Spencer, 
just a little nettled, “it would 
be too time-consuming. As you 
know, our license specifies 
that we donate ten per cent 
of our operating time to pub- 
lic interest projects. This we 
are most meticulous in doing, 

GLEANERS 



although I don’t mind telling 
you there’s nothing that gives 
us greater headaches.” 

“But that ten per cent . .” 
“If we took up this project 
you are urging, doctor, we’d 
use up all our public interest 
time for several years at least. 
That would mean no other 
programs at all.” 

"But surely you’ll concede 
that no other proposal could 
be in a greater public inter- 
est.” 

“That’s not our findings,” 
Spencer told him. “We took 
opinion samplings in every 
area on Earth, in all possible 
cross-sections. We came up 
with — sacrilege.” 

“You’re joking, Mr. Spen- 
cer!” 

“Not at all,” said Spencer. 
“Our opinion-taking showed 
quite conclusively that any 
attempt to investigate world- 
wide religious origins would 
be viewed by the general pub- 
lic in a sacrilegious light. You 
and I, perhaps, could look up- 
on it as research. We could 
resolve all our questioning by 
saying we sought no more nor 
less than truth. But the people 
of the world — the simple, 
common people of every sect 
and faith in the entire world 
— do not want the truth. They 
are satisfied with things just 
as they are. They’re afraid we 
would upset a lot of the old, 
comfortable traditions. They 
call it sacrilege and it’s partly 
that, of course, but it’s like- 
wise an instinctive defense re- 

13 




action against upsetting their 
thinking. They have a faith to 
cling to. It has served them 
thi^ough the years and they 
don't want anyone to fool 
around with it." 

“I simply can't believe it," 
said Ravenholt, aghast at such 
blind provincialism. 

“I have the figures. I can 
show you." 

Dr. Ravenholt waved his 
hand condescendingly and 
gracefully. 

‘Tf you say you have them, 
I am sure you have." 

He wasn't taking any 
chances of being proven 
wrong. 

A NOTHER thing," said 
Spencer, “is objectivity. 
How do you select the men to 
send back to observe the 
facts?" 

“I am sure that we could 
get them. There are many men 
of the cloth, of every creed 
and faith, who would be amply 
qualified . ." 

“Those are just the ones 
we would never think of send- 
ing," said Spencer. “We need 
objectivity. Ideally, the kind 
of nian we need is one who has 
no interest in religion, who 
has no formal training in it, 
one who is neither for it 
nor against it — and yet, we 
couldn't use that sort of man 
even if we found him. For to 
understand what is going on, 
he'd have to have a rather 
thorough briefing on what he 
was to look for. Once you 



trained him, he'd be bound to 
lose his objectivity. There is 
something about religion that 
forces one to take positions 
on it." 

“Now," said Ravenholt, 
''you are talking about the 
ideal investigative situation, 
not our own." 

“Well, all right, then," con- 
ceded Spencer. “Let's say we 
decide to do a slightly sloppy 
job. Who do we send then? 
Could any Christian, I ask 
you, no matter how poor a 
Christian he might be, safely 
be sent back to the days that 
Jesus spent on Earth? How 
could one be sure that even 
mediocre Christians would do 
no more than observe the 
facts? I tell you. Dr. Raven- 
holt, we could not take the 
chance. What would happen, 
do you think, if we suddenly 
should have thirteen instead 
of twelve disciples? What if 
someone should try to rescue 
Jesus from the Cross? Worse 
yet, what if He actually were 
rescued? Where would Chris- 
tianity be then? Would there 
be Christianity? Without the 
Crucifixion, would it ever have 
survived?" 

“Your problem has a sim- 
ple answer," Ravenholt said 
coldly. “Do not send a Chris- 
tian." 

“Now we are really getting 
somewhere," said Spencer. 
“Let's send a Moslem to get 
the Christian facts and a 
Christian to track down the 
life of Buddha — and a Bud-

dhist to investigate black 
magic in the Belgian Congo.” 

‘‘It could work,” said Rav- 
enholt. 

“It might work, but you 
wouldn't get objectivity. 
You'd get bias and, worse yet, 
perfectly honest misunder- 
standing." 

Ravenholt drummed impa- 
tient fingers on his well- 
creased knee. “I can see your 
point," he agreed, somewhat 
irritably, “but there is some- 
thing you have overlooked. 
The findings need not be re- 
leased in their entirety to the 
public." 

“But if it's in the public 
interest? That's what our li- 
cense says." 

“Would it help," asked Rav- 
enholt, “if I should offer 
certain funds which could be 
used to help defray the costs?" 

“In such a case," said Spen- 
cer, blandly, “the requirement 
would not be met. It’s either 
in the public interest, without 
any charge at all, or it's a 
commercial contract paid for 
at regular rates.” 

“The obvious fact," Raven- 
holt said flatly, “is that you 
do not want to do this job. 
You may as well admit it.” 

“Most cheerfully," said 
Spencer. “I willingly wouldn't 
touch it with a ten-foot pole. 
What worries me right now is 
why you're here.” 

Ravenholt said, “I thought 
that with the project about 
to be rejected, I possibly could 
serve as a sort of mediator.” 



mean you thought 
jL we could be bribed.” 
“Not at all," said Raven- 
holt wrathfully. “I was only 
recognizing that the project 
was perhaps a cut beyond 
what your license calls for.” 
“It's all of that," said Spen- 
cer. 

“I cannot fully understand 
your objection to it,” Raven- 
holt persisted. 

“Dr. Ravenholt,” said Spen- 
cer gently, “how would you 
like to be responsible for the 
destruction of a faith?" 

“But," stammered Raven- 
holt, “there is no such possi- 
bility . .” 

“Are you certain?” Spencer 
asked him. “How certain are 
you. Dr. Ravenholt? Even the 
black magic of the Congo?" 

“Well, I — well, since you 
put it that way ..." 

“You see what I mean?" 
asked Spencer. 

“But even so,” argued Rav- 
enholt, “there could be certain 
facts suppressed ..." 

“Come now! How long do 
you think you could keep it 
bottled up? Anyway, when 
Past, Inc., does a job," Spen- 
cer told him firmly, “it goes 
gunning for the truth. And 
when we learn it, we report 
it. That is the one excuse we 
have for our continuing exist- 
ence. We have a certain proj- 
ect here — a personal, full-rate 
contract — in which we have 
traced a family tree for al- 
most two thousand years. We 
have been forced to tell our

client some unpleasant things. 
But we told them.” 

“That’s part of what I’m 
trying to convey to you,” 
shouted Ravenholt, shaken 
finally out of his ruthless calm. 
“You are willing to embark 
upon the tracing of a family 
tree, but you refuse this!” 
“And you are confusing 
two utterly different opera- 
tions ! This investigation of 
religious origins is a public 
interest matter. Family Tree 
is a private acount for which 
we’re being paid.” 

Ravenholt rose angrily. 
“We’ll discuss this some other 
time, when we both can keep 
our temper.” 

Spencer said wearily, “It 
won’t do any good. My mind 
is made up.” 

“Mr. Spencer,” Ravenholt 
said, nastily, “I’m not without 
recourse.” 

“Perhaps you’re not. You 
can go above my head. If that 
is what you’re thinking. I’ll 
tell you something else : You’ll 
carry out this project over my 
dead body. I will not. Dr. 
Ravenholt, betray the faith of 
any people in the world.” 
“We’ll see,” said Ravenholt, 
still nasty. 

“Now,” said Spencer, 
“you’re thinking that you can 
have me fired. Probably you 
could. Undoubtedly you know 
the very strings to pull. But 
it’s no solution.” 

“I would think,” said Rav- 
cnholt, “it would be the per- 
fect one.”

“I’d still fight you as a pri- 
vate citizen. I’d take it to the 
floor of the United Nations 
if I had to.” 

They both were on their 
feet now, facing one another 
across the width of desk. 

“I’m sorry,” Spencer said, 
“that it turned out this way. 
But I meant everything I 
said.” 

“So did I,” said Ravenholt, 
stalking out the door. 

Ill 

S PENCER sat down slowly 
in his chair. 

A swell way to start a day, 
he told himself. 

But the guy had burned him 
up. 

Miss Crane came in the 
door with a sheaf of papers 
for his desk. 

“Mr. Spencer, shall I send 
in Mr. Hudson? He’s been 
waiting a long time.” 

“Is Hudson the applicant?” 
“No, that is Mr. Cabell.” 
“Cabell is the man I want 
to see. Bring me his file.” She 
sniffed contemptuously and 
left. 

Damn her, Spencer told 
himself. I’ll see who I want 
to see when I want to see 
them! 

He was astounded at the 
violence of his thought. What 
was wrong with him? Noth- 
ing was going right. Couldn’t 
he get along with anyone any 
more? 

Too tensed up, he thought. 

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




Too many things to do, too 
much to worry over. 

Maybe what he ought to do 
was walk out into Operations 
and step into a carrier for a 
long vacation. Back to the Old 
Stone Age, which would re- 
quire no Indoctrination. There 
wouldn’t be too many people, 
perhaps none at all. But 
there’d be mosquitoes. And 
cave bear. And saber-tooths 
and perhaps a lot of other 
things equally obnoxious. And 
he’d have to get some camping 
stuff together and — oh, the 
hell with it! 

But it was not a bad idea. 

He’d thought about it often. 
Some day he would do it. 
Meanwhile, he picked up the 
sheaf of papers Miss Crane 
had dropped upon his desk. 

They were the daily batch 
of future assignments dream- 
ed up by the Dirty Tricks de- 
partment. There was always 
trouble in them. He felt him- 
self go tense as he picked them 
up. 

The first one was a routine 
enough assignment — an inves- 
tigation of some tributes paid 
the Goths by Rome. There 
was, it seemed, a legend that 
the treasure had been buried 
somewhere in the Alps. It 
might never have been recov- 
ered. That was S.O.P., check- 
ing up on buried treasure. 

But the second paper — 

‘‘lY/flSS Crane!” he yelled. 

i*A She was coming 
through the door, with a file 



clutched in her hand. Her face 
changed not a whit at his yelp 
of anguish ; she was used to it. 

“What is the matter, Mr. 
Spencer?” she inquired, at 
least three degrees too calmly. 

Spencer banged his fist 
down on the pile of sheets. 
“They can’t do this to me! I 
won’t stand for it. Get Rogers 
on the phone!” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“No, wait a minute there,” 
Spencer interrupted grimly. 
“This I can do better personal. 
I’ll go up and see him. In fact. 
I’ll take him apart bare- 
handed.” 

“But there are those people 
waiting ...” 

“Let them wait for a while. 
It will make them humble.” 

He snatched up the assign- 
ment sheet and went striding 
out the door. He shunned the 
elevator. He climbed two 
flights of stairs. He went in a 
door marked Evaluation. 

Rogers was sitting tilted 
back, with his feet up on the 
desk top, staring at the ceil- 
ing. 

He glanced at Spencer with 
a bland concern. He took his 
feet down off the desk and sat 
forward in his chair. 

“Well? What’s the matter 
this time?” 

“This!” said Spencer, 
throwing the sheet down in 
front of him. 

Rogers poked it with a deli- 
cate finger. “Nothing difficult 
there. Just a little ingenu- 
ity . .”

“Nothing difficult!” howled 
Spencer. “Movies of Nero’s 
fire in Rome!” 

Rogej'S sighed. “This movie 
outfit will pay us plenty for 
it.” 

“And there’s nothing to it. 
One of my men can just walk 
out into the burning streets 
of Rome and set up a movie 
camera in an age whei*e the 
principle of a camera hasn’t 
yet been thought of.” 

“Well, I said it would call 
for some ingenuity,” said 
Rogers. “Look, there’ll be a 
lot of people running, carry- 
ing stuff, trying to save them- 
selves and anything they can. 
They won’t pay any attention 
to your man. He can cover the 
camera with something so 
that it will look ...” 

“It’ll be an ugly crowd,” in- 
sisted Spencer. “It won’t like 
the city being burned. Thei*e’ll 
be rumors that the Christians 
are the ones who set the fire. 
That crowd will be looking for 
suspicious characters.” 
“There’s always an element 
of danger,” Rogers pointed 
out. 

‘‘lyrOT as , dangerous as 
this!” said Spencer, 
testily. “Not deliberately ask- 
ing for it. And there is some- 
thing else.” 

“Like what?” 

“Like introducing an ad- 
vanced technology to the past. 
If that crowd beat up my man 
and busted the camera ...” 
Rogers shrugged. “What 

18 



difference if they did? They 
could make nothing of it.” 
“Maybe. But what I’m real- 
ly worried about,” Spencer 
persisted, “is what the watch- 
dog group would say when 
they audit our records. It 
would have to be worth an 
awful lot of money before I’d 
take a chance.” 

“Believe me, it is worth a 
lot of money. And it would 
open up a new field for us. 
That’s why I liked it.” 

“You guys in Dirty Tricks,” 
said Spencer, bitterly, “just 
don’t give a damn. You’ll hand 
us anything . .” 

“Not everything,” said 
Rogers. “Sales pushed us pret- 
ty hard on this one ...” 
“Sales!” spat Spencer, con- 
tempt in his voice. 

“There was a woman in 
here the other day,” said 
Rogers. “She wanted to 
send her two children to 
their great-great-great-grand- 
father’s farm back in the nine- 
teenth century. For a vaca- 
tion, mind you. A summer in 
the country in another cen- 
tury. Said it would be educa- 
tional and quite relaxing for 
them. Said the old folks would 
understand and be glad to 
have them once we had ex- 
plained.” 

Rogers sighed. “I had quite 
a session with her. She pooh- 
poohed our regulations. She 
said . .” 

“You passed up a good one 
there,” Spencer said sarcas- 
tically. “That would have 

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




opened up another field — 
vacations in the past. I can 
see it now. Family reunions 
with old friends and neigh- 
bors foregathering across the 
centuries.” 

‘‘You think you are the only 
one who has his troubles.” 

“I am bleeding for you,” 
Spencer told him. 

“There^s a TV outfit,” Rog- 
ers said, “that wants inter- 
views with Napoleon and 
Caesar and Alexander and all 
the rest of those ancient big- 
shots. There are hunters who 
want to go back into the pri- 
mordial wilderness to get a 
spot of shooting. There are 
universities that want to 
send teams of investigators 
back ...” 

“You know that all of 
that is out,” said Spencer. 
“The only ones we can send 
back are travelers we have 
trained.” 

“ There Ve been times.” 

“Oh, sure, a few. But only 
when we got a special dispen- 
sation. And we sent along so 
many travelers to guard them 
that it was an expedition in- 
stead of a simple little study 
group.” 

Spencer got up from his 
chair. “Well, what about this 
latest brainstorm?” 

Rogers picked up the of- 
fending assignment sheet and 
tossed it into an overflowing 
basket. 

“ni go down to Sales, with 
tears streaming down my 
cheeks ...” 



•‘Thanks,” said Spencer and 
went out. 

IV 

B ack in his office, he sat 
down at the desk and 
picked up the file on Cabell. 

The squawk box gibbered 
at him. He thumbed up the 
lever. 

“What is it?” 

“Operations, Hal. Williams 
just got back. Everything’s 
okay; he snagged the Picasso 
without any trouble. Only took 
six weeks.” 

“Six weeks!” Spencer yell- 
ed. “He could have painted it 
himself in that time!” 

“There were complica- 
tions.” 

“Is there any time there 
aren’t?” 

“It’s a good one, Hal. Not 
damaged. Worth a hunk of 
dough.” 

“O.K.” said Spencer, “take 
it down to Customs and let 
them run it through. The good 
old government must be paid 
its duty. And what about the 
others?” 

“Nickerson will be leaving 
in just a little while.” 

“And E.J.?” 

“He’s fussy about the time 
fix. He is telling Doug . .” 
“Look,” yelled Spencer 
wrathfully, “you tell him for 
me that the fix is Doug’s job. 
Doug knows more about it 
than E.J. ever will. When 
Doug says it’s time to hop, 
E.J. hops, funny cap and all.”

He snapped down the lever 
and turned back to the Cabell 
file, sitting quietly for a mo- 
ment to let his blood pressure 
simmer down. 

He got worked up too easily, 
he told himself. He blew his 
top too much. But there never 
was a job with so many 
aggravations ! 

He opened the folder and 
ran through the Cabell file. 

Stewart Belmont Cabell, 27, 
unmarried, excellent refer- 
ences, a doctorate in sociolo- 
gy from an ivy college. A uni- 
formly high score in all the 
tests, including attitude, and 
an astonishing I.Q. Unquali- 
fiedly recommended for em- 
ployment as a traveler. 

Spencer closed the file and 
pushed it to one side. 

“Send Mr. Cabell in,” he 
told Miss Crane. 

Cabell was a lanky man, 
awkward in his movements; 
he seemed younger than he 
was. There was a certain shy- 
ness in his manner when 
Spencer shook his hand and 
pointed out a chair. 

Cabell sat and tried, with- 
out success, to make himself 
at ease. 

“So you want to come in 
with us,” said Spencer. “I 
suppose you know what you 
are doing.” 

“Yes, sir,” said young Ca- 
bell. “I know all about it. Or 
perhaps I’d better say ...” 

He stammered and stopped 
talking. 

“It’s all right,” said Spen- 



cer. “I take it you want this 
very much.” 

Cabell nodded. 

“I know how it is. You al- 
most have the feeling you’ll 
die if you can’t do it.” 

And he remembered, sitting 
there, how it had been with 
him — the terrible, tearing 
heartache when he’d been re- 
jected as a traveler, and how 
he had stuck on regardless of 
that hurt and disappointment. 
First as operator ; then as 
operations superintendent; fi- 
nally to this desk, with all its 
many headaches. 

“Not,” he said, “that I have 
ever traveled.” 

“I didn’t know that, sir.” 
“I wasn’t good enough. My 
attitudes were wrong.” 

A nd he saw the old hope 
and hunger in the eyes of 
the man across the desk — ^and 
something else besides. Some- 
thing vaguely disturbing. 

“It’s not all fun,” he said, 
a shade more harshly th^n he 
had meant to make it. “At first 
there’s the romance and the 
glitter, but that soon wears 
olT. It becomes a job. Some- 
times a bitter one.” 

He paused and looked at 
Cabell and the queer, disturb- 
ing light still was shining in 
his eyes. 

“You should know,” he said, 
deliberately harsh this time, 
“that if you come in with us 
you’ll probably be dead of ad- 
vanced old age in five years.” 
Cabell nodded unconcein- 



20 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




edly. know that, sir. The 
people down in Personnel ex- 
plained it all to me.” 

'‘Good,” said Spencer. “I 
suspect at times that Person- 
nel makes a rather shabby 
explanation. They tell you just 
enough to make it sound con- 
vincing, but they do not tell 
it all. They are far too anxious 
to keep us well supplied. We're 
always short of travelers; we 
run through them too fast.” 
He paused and looked at the 
man again. There was no 
change in him. 

"We have certain regula- 
tions,” Spencer told him. 
"They aren’t made so much 
by Past, Inc., as by the job 
itself. You cannot have any 
settled sort of life. You live 
out your life in pieces, like 
a patchwork quilt, hopping 
from neighborhood to neigh- 
borhood, and those neighbor- 
hoods all many years apart. 
There is no actual rule against 
it, but none of our travelers 
has ever married. It would be 
impossible. In five years the 
man would die of old age, and 
his wife would still be young.” 
"I think I understand, sir.” 
"Actually,” Spencer said, 
"it’s a very simple matter of 
simple economics. We cannot 
afford to have either our ma- 
chines or men tied up for any 
length of time. So while a man 
may be gone a week, a month, 
or years, the machine comes 
hack, with him inside of it, 
sixty seconds after he has left. 
That sixty seconds is an arbi- 



trary period; it could be a 
single second, it could be an 
hour or day or anything we 
wanted. One minute has 
seemed a practical period.” 
"And,” asked Cabell, "if it 
does not come back within 
that minute?” 

"Then it never will.” 

"It sometimes happens?” 

course it happens. 

Time traveling is no 
picnic. Every time a man 
goes back he is betting his life 
that he can get along in an 
environment which is as total- 
ly alien, in some instances, as 
another planet. We help him 
every way we can, of course. 
We make it our business to 
see that he is well briefed 
and Indoctrinated and as well 
equipped as it is possible to 
make him. He is taught the 
languages he is likely to re- 
quire. He is clothed properly. 
But there are instances when 
we simply do not know the 
little vital details which mean 
survival. Sometimes we learn 
them later when our man 
comes back and tells us. Usu- 
ally he is quite profane about 
it. And some we don’t find out 
about at all. The man does 
not come back.” 

"One would think,” said 
Cabell, "that you would like 
to scare me out.” 

"No! I tell you this because 
I want no misunderstanding. 
It costs a lot to train a trav- 
eler. We must get our costs 
back. We do not want a man

who will stay with us just a 
little while. We don’t want a 
year or two from you ; we 
want your entire life. We’ll 
take you and we’ll wring you 
dry of every minute ...” 

“I can assure you, sir ...” 
‘'We send you where we 
want you,” Spencer said, “and 
although we have no control 
of you once you’ve left, we 
expect that you’ll not fool 
around. Not that you won’t 
come back inside of sixty sec- 
onds — naturally you will, if 
you come back at all. But we 
want you to come back as 
young as possible. Past, Inc., 
is a pure commercial venture. 
We’ll squeeze all the trips we 
possibly can out of you.” 

“I understand all this,” said 
Cabell, “but Personnel ex- 
plained it would be to my ad- 
vantage, too.” 

uri^HAT is true, of course, 
A but it’ll not take you 
long to find that money is of 
slight moment to a traveler. 
Since you have no family, or 
we would hope you haven’t, 
what would you need it for? 
The only leisure time 3^ou’ll 
have is a six-week’s annual 
leave and you can earn enough 
in a trip or two to spend that 
leave in utmost luxury or the 
deepest vice. 

“Most of the men, however, 
don’t even bother to do that. 
They just wander off and get 
re-acquainted with the era 
they were born into. Vice and 
luxuiy in this present century 



has but slight appeal to them 
after all the hell they’ve raised 
in past centuries at the com- 
pany’s expense.” 

“You are kidding, sir.” 
“Well, maybe just a little. 
But in certain cases that I 
have in mind, it is the honest 
truth.” 

Spencer stared across at 
Cabell. 

“None of this bothers you ?” 
he asked. 

“Not a thing so far.” 
“There’s just one thing else, 
Mr. Cabell, that you should 
know about. That is the need 
— the imperative, crying need 
for objectivity. When you go 
into the past, you take no part 
in it. You do not interfere. 
You must not get involved ” 
“That should not be hard.” 
“I warn you, Mr. Cabell, 
that it requires moral stami- 
na. The man who travels in 
time has terrible power. And 
there’s something about the 
feel of power that makes it 
almost compulsive for a man 
to use it. Hand in hand with 
that power is the temptation 
to take a hand in history. To 
wield a judicious knife, to say 
a word that needs saying very 
badly. To save a life that, 
given a few more years of 
time, might have pushed the 
human race an extra step to- 
ward greatness.” 

“It might be hard,” admit- 
ted Cabell. 

Spencer nodded. “So far as 
I know, Mr. Cabell, no one 
has ever succumbed to these 



22 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




temptations. But I live in ter- 
ror of the day when someone 
does.” 

And he wondered as he 
said it how much he might 
be talking through his hat, 
might be whistling past the 
graveyard. For surely there 
must by now have been some 
interference. 

What about the men who 
had not come back? 

Some of them undoubtedly 
had died. But surely some had 
stayed. And wasn't staying 
back there the worst form of 
intervention? What were the 
implications, he wondered, of 
a child born out of time — a 
child that had not been born 
before, that should never have 
been born? The children of 
that child and the children of 
those children — they would 
be a thread of temporal inter- 
ference reaching through the 
ages. 

V 

C ABELL asked : “Is there 
something wrong, sir?” 
'‘No. I was just thinking 
that the time will surely come, 
some day, when we work out 
a formula for safely interfer- 
ing in the past. And when that 
happens, our responsibilities 
will be even greater than the 
ones that we face now. For 
then we’ll have license for 
intervening, but will in turn 
be placed under certain stric- 
tures to use that power of 
intervention only for the best. 



I can't imagine what sort of 
principle it will be, you under- 
stand. But I am sure that soon 
or late we will arrive at it. 

“And perhaps, too, we'll 
work out another formula 
which will allow us to venture 
to the future.” 

He shook his head and 
thought : How like an old man, 
to shake your head in resigned 
puzzlement. But he was not 
an old man — ^not very old, at 
least. 

“At the moment,” he said, 
“we are little more than glean- 
ers. We go into the past to 
pick up the gleanings — ^the 
things they lost or threw 
away. We have made up cer- 
tain rules to make sure that 
we never touch the sheaves, 
but only the ear of wheat left 
lying on the ground.” 

“Like the Alexandria manu- 
scripts?” 

“Well, yes, I would sup- 
pose so — although grabbing 
all those manuscripts and 
books was inspired entirely 
by a sordid profit motive. We 
could just as easily have cop- 
ied them. Some of them we 
did; but the originals them- 
selves represented a tremen- 
dous sum of money. I would 
hate to tell you what Harvard 
paid us for those manu- 
scripts. Although, when you 
think of it,” Spencer said, re- 
flectively. “I'm not sure they 
weren't worth every cent of 
it. It called for the closest 
planning and split-second co- 
ordinating and we used every 

23 



GLEANERS 




man we had. For, you see, we 
couldn’t grab the stuff until 
it was on the verge of burn- 
ing. We couldn’t deprive even 
so much as a single person 
the chance of even glancing at 
a single manuscript. We can’t 
lift a thing until it’s lost. 
That’s an iron-bound rule. 

"Now, you take the Ely 
tapestry. We waited for 
years, going back and check- 
ing, until we were quite sure 
that it was finally lost. We 
knew it was going to be 
lost, you understand. But we 
couldn’t touch it until it was 
lost for good. Then we h’isted 
it.’’ He waved a hand. “I talk 
too much. I am boring you.” 
"Mr. Spencer, sir,” protest- 
ed Cabell, “talk like yours 
could never bore me. This is 
something I have dreamed of. 
I can’t tell you how happy ...” 
Spencer raised a hand to 
stop him. “Not so fast. You 
aren’t hired yet.” 

“But Mr. Jensen down in 
Personnel ...” 

“I know what Jensen said. 
But the final word is mine.” 
“What have I done wrong?” 
asked Cabell. 

“You have done nothing 
wrong. Come back this after- 
noon.” 

“But, Mr. Spencer, if only 
you could tell me ...” 

“I want to think about you. 
See me after lunch.” 

C ABELL unfolded upward 
from his chair and he was 
ill at ease. 



“That man who was in 
ahead of me . .” 

“Yes. What about him?” 

“He seemed quite angry, 
sir. As if he might be think- 
ing of making trouble for 
you.” 

Spencer said angrily, “And 
that’s none of your damn 
business!” 

Cabell stood his ground. “I 
was only going to say, sir, 
that I recognized him.” 

“So?” 

“If he did try to cause you 
trouble, sir, it might be worth 
your while to investigate his 
asociation with a stripper 
down at the Golden Hour. Her 
name is Silver Starr.” 

Spencer stared at Cabell 
without saying anything. 

The man edged toward the 
door. 

He put out his hand to 
grasp the knob, then turned 
back to Spencer “Perhaps 
that’s not actually her name, 
but it’s fine for advertising — 
Silver Starr at the Golden 
Hour. The Golden Hour is 
located at . .” 

“Mr. Cabell,” Spencer said, 
“I’ve been at the Golden 
Hour.” 

The impudent punk! What 
did he figure he was doing — 
buying his way in? 

He sat quietly for a mo- 
ment after Cabell had gone 
out, cooling down a bit, won- 
dering about the man. There 
had been something about him 
that had been disturbing. That 
look in his eyes, for one thing.

And the awkwardness and 
shyness didn’t ring quite true. 
As if it had been an act of 
some sort. But why, in the 
name of God, should anyone 
put on such an act when it 
would be quite clearly to his 
disadvantage? 

You’re psycho, Spencer told 
himself. You’re getting so you 
jump at every shadow, sight 
a lurking figure behind every 
bush. 

Two down, he thought, and 
another one to see — that is, 
if more had not piled into the 
office and were out there wait- 
ing for him. 

He reached out his hand to 
press the buzzer. But before 
his finger touched it, the back 
door of the office suddenly 
burst open. A wild-eyed man 
came stumbling through it. 
He had something white and 
wriggly clutched within his 
arms. He dumped the white 
and wriggly thing on Hallock 
Spencer’s desk and unhappily 
stepped back. 

It was a rabbit — a white 
rabbit with a great pink rib- 
bon tied around its neck in a 
fancy bow. 

S PENCER glanced up, star- 
tled, at the man who’d 
brought the rabbit. 

“Ackermann,” he shouted. 
“For Chrissake, Ackermann, 
what is the matter with you ? 
It isn’t Easter yet!” 
Ackermann worked his 
mouth in a painful manner 
and his Adam’s apple went 

GLEANERS 



bobbing up and down. But he 
made no words come out. 

“Come on, man!” What is 
it?” 

Ackermann got his voice 
back. “It’s Nickerson!” he 
blurted. 

“O.K.,so Nickerson brought 
a rabbit back . .” 

“He didn’t bring it back, 
sir. It came all by itself!” 
“And Nickerson?” 
Ackermann shook his head. 
“There was just the rabbit.” 
Spencer had started to get 
up from the chair. Now he sat 
back down again, harder than 
intended. 

“There’s an envelope, sir, 
tied to the rabbit’s bow.” 

“So I see,” said Spencer, 
absently. But he felt the cold- 
ness running through him. 

The rabbit hoisted itself 
around until it was face to 
face with Spencer. It flapped 
an ear, wiggled its pink nose 
at him, put its head carefully 
to one side and lifted a delib- 
erate hind leg to scratch a flea. 

He pivoted in his chair and 
watched the operator sidle 
through the door. Three men 
lost in the last ten days. And 
now there was a fourth. 

But this time, at least, he’d 
got back the carrier. The rab- 
bit had brought back the car- 
rier. Any living thing, once 
the mechanism had been rig- 
ged, by its very presence 
would have brought back the 
carrier. It need not be a man. 

But Nickerson! Nickerson 
was one of the best there were. 

25 




If a man could not depend on 
Nickerson, there was no one 
that he could. 

He turned back to the desk 
and reached for the rabbit. It 
didn't try to get away. He 
slipped out the folded sheet 
of paper and broke the blob 
of sealing wax. The paper was 
so stiff and heavy that it 
crackled as he smoothed it. 

The ink was dead black and 
the script cramped. No foun- 
tain pen, thought Spencer — 
nothing but a goose quill. 

The letter was addressed to 
him. It said: 

Dear Hal : I have no logi- 
cal excuse and I'll attempt 
no explanation. I have 
found a sense of springtime 
and cannot compel myself 
to leave it. You have your 
carrier and that is better 
than any of the others ever 
did for you. The rabbit will 
not mind. A rabbit knows 
no time. Be kind to him — 
for he is no coarse, wild 
hare of the briery fields, 
but a loving pet. Nick. 

I NADEQUATE, thought 
Spencer, staring at the 
note, with its scrawly black 
more like cabalistic pattern 
than a communication . 

He had found a sense of 
springtime. What did he mean 
by that? A springtime of the 
heart? A springtime of the 
spirit? That might well be it, 
for Nickerson had gone to 
Italy in the early Renaissance. 



A springtime of the spirit and 
the sense of great beginnings. 
And perhaps that wasn't all of 
it. Would there be as well a 
certain sense of spiritual se- 
curity in that smaller world 
— a world that tinkered with 
no time, that reached toward 
no stars? 

The buzzer sounded softly. 

Spencer tipped up the lever 
on the intercom. '‘Yes, Miss 
Crane?" 

"Mr. Garside on the phone." 

The rabbit was nibbling at 
the phone cord. Spencer 
pushed him to one side. "Yes, 
Chris." 

The gray, clipped voice 
said: "Hal, what's with you 
and Ravenholt? He gave me 
a bad half hour." 

"It v/as Project God." 

"Yes, he told me that. He 
threatened to raise a howl 
about the ethics of our mag- 
azine project." 

"He can’t do that," pro- 
tested Spencer. "He'd have no 
grounds at all. That one is 
clean. It has the green light 
from Legal and from Ethics 
and the review board gave its 
blessing. It's simply historical 
reporting. Eyewitness from 
the battle of Gettysburg, fa- 
shion notes on the spot from 
the time of Queen Victoria — 
it's the biggest thing we've 
tackled. Its promotional value 
alone, aside from the money 
that we'll make ...” 

"Yes, I know," said Gar- 
side, tiredly. "All of that is 
true. But I don't want to get 



26 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




into a hassle with anyone — 
particularly not with Raven- 
holt. We have too many irons 
in the fire right now for any- 
thing unfavorable to pop. And 
Ravenholt can be a terribly 
dirty fighter.” 

“Look, Chris. I can take 
care of Ravenholt.” 

“I knew you would. What 
is more, you’d better.” 

“And,” demanded Spencer, 
bristling, “what do you mean 
by that?” 

“Well, frankly, Hal, your 
record doesn’t look too 
good. You’ve been having 
trouble ...” 

“You mean the men we’ve 
lost.” 

“And the machines,” said 
Garside. “You’re all the time 
forgetting — a machine costs 
a quarter million.” 

“And the men?” asked 
Spencer bitterly. “Perhaps 
you think they’re compara- 
tively cheap.” 

“I don’t suppose,” said Gar- 
side blandly, “that you can 
place an actual value on a 
human life.” 

^®st another one to- 
” day,” said Spencer. “I 
imagine you’ll be happy to 
know that he was loyal beyond 
the call of duty. He sent a 
rabbit back and the machine 
is safe and sound.” 

“Hal,” said Garside, stern- 
ly, “this is something we can 
discuss at some later time. 
Right now I’m concerned with 
Ravenholt. If you’d go and 

GLEANERS 



apolo^ze to him and try to 
fix things up ...” 

“Apologize!” exploded 
Spencer, “I know a better way 
than that. He’s been shacking 
with a stripper down at the 
Golden Hour. By the time I 
get through ...” 

“Hal!” yelled Garside. “You 
can’t do a thing like that ! You 
can’t involve Past, Inc., in 
anything like that! Why, it 
isn’t decent!” 

“You mean it’s dirty,” 
Spencer said. “No dirtier than 
Ravenholt. Who is he front- 
ing for?” 

“It makes no difference. 
Young man ...” 

“Don’t young man me,” 
yelled Spencer. “I’ve got trou- 
bles enough without being 
patronized.” 

“Perhaps your troubles are 
too much for you,” said Gar- 
side, speaking very gray and 
clipped. “Perhaps we ought 
to find another man.” 

“Do it then!” yelled Spen- 
cer. “Don’t just sit there 
shooting off your face. Come 
on down and fire me!” 

He slammed the receiver 
down into its cradle and sat 
shivering with rage. 

Damn Garside, he thought. 
To hell with Past, Inc. He’d 
taken all he could! 

Still, it was a lousy way to 
end after fifteen years. It was 
a stinking thing to happen. 
Maybe he ought to have kept 
his mouth shut, kept his tem- 
per down, played it sweet and 
smooth. 

27 




Perhaps, he could have 
done it differently. He could 
have assured Garside he’d 
take care of Ravenholt with- 
out saying anything about 
Silver Starr. And why had he 
grabbed hold so trustfully of 
what Cabell had told him that 
moment before leaving? What 
could Cabell know about it? 
In just a little while now he’d 
have to check if there were 
anyone by the name of Silver 
Starr down at the Golden 
Hour. 

Meanwhile there was work 
to do. Hudson now, he 
thought. 

He reached for the buzzer. 

But his finger never touch- 
ed it. Once more the back door 
burst open with a smashing 
rattle and a man came tearing 
in. It was Douglas Marshall, 
operator for E.J.’s machine. 

“Hal,” he gasped, “you’d 
better come. E.J.’s really tore 
it!” 

VI 

S PENCER didn’t ask a 
question. One look at 
Doug’s face was quite enough 
to tell him the news was very 
bad. He bounced out of his 
chair and rushed through the 
door, close on the operator’s 
heels. 

They tore down the corri- 
dor and turned left into Oper- 
ations, with the rows of bulgy, 
bulky carriers lined against 
the wall. 

Down at the far end a small 



crowd of operators and me- 
chanics formed a ragged cir- 
cle and from the center of the 
circle came the sound of rib- 
ald song. The words were not 
intelligible. 

Spencer strode forward 
angrily and pushed through 
the circle. There, in the center 
of it, was E.J. and another 
person — a filthy, bearded, 
boisterous barbarian wrapped 
in a mangy bearskin and with 
a tremendous sword strapped 
about his middle. 

The barbarian had a small- 
ish keg tilted to his mouth. 
The keg was gurgling ; he was 
drinking from it, but he was 
missing some as well, for 
streams of pale, brown liquid 
were running down his front. 

“E.J. !” yelled Spencer. 

At the shout, the barbarian 
jerked the keg down from his 
face and tucked it hurriedly 
underneath an arm. With a 
big and dirty hand, he mopped 
the whiskers adjacent to his 
mouth. 

E.J. stumbled forward and 
threw his arms around Spen- 
cer’s neck, laughing all the 
while. 

Spencer jerked E.J. loose 
and pushed him, stumbling, 
backwards. 

“E.J. !” he yelled. “What is 
so damn funny?” 

E.J. managed to stop stum- 
bling backwards. He tried to 
pull himself together, but he 
couldn’t because he still was 
laughing hard. 

The barbarian stepped for- 



28 



CLIFFORD D. SIAAAK 




ward and thrust the keg into 
Spencer’s hands, shouting 
something at him in a con- 
vivial tone of voice and pan- 
tomiming with his hands that 
the keg had stuff to drink. 

E.J. made an exaggerated 
thumb at the gent in bearskin. 
“Hal, it wasn’t any Roman 
officer!” Then he went off into 
gales of laughter once again. 

The barbarian started to 
laugh, too, uproariously, 
throwing back his head and 
bellowing in great peals of 
laughter that shook the very 
room. 

E.J. staggered over and 
they fell into one another’s 
arms, guffawing happily and 
pounding one another on the 
back. Somehow they got tan- 
gled up. They lost their bal- 
ance. They fell down on the 
floor and sat there, the two of 
them, looking up at the men 
around them. 

“Now!” Spencer roared at 
E.J. 

E.J. clapped the man in 
bearskin a resounding whack 
upon his hairy shoulder. “Just 
bringing back the Wrightson- 
Graves her far-removed 
grand-pappy. I can’t wait to 
see her face when I take him 
up there!” 

“Oh, my God!” said Spen- 
cer. He turned around and 
thrust the dripping keg into 
someone’s hands. 

He snapped, “Don’t let them 
get away. Put them someplace 
where they can sleep it off.” 

A hand grabbed him by the 

GLEANERS 



arm and there was Douglas 
Marshall, sweating. “We got 
to send him back. Chief,” said 
Doug. “E.J.’s got to take him 
back.” 

Spencer shook his head. “I 
don’t know if we can. I’ll put 
it up to Legal. Just keep them 
here, and tell the boys. Tell 
them if one of them so much 
as whispers ...” 

“I’ll do my best,” said Doug. 
“But I don’t know. They’re 
a bunch of blabbermouths.” 
Spencer jerked away and 
sprinted for the corridor. 

What a day, he thought. 
What a loused-up day! 

H e charged down the cor- 
ridor and saw that the 
door marked Private was 
closed. He skidded almost to 
a halt, reaching for the knob, 
when the door flew open. Miss 
Crane came tearing out. 

She slammed into him 
head-on. Both of them 
bounced back. Miss Crane’s 
spectacles knocked at a crazy 
angle by the impact. 

“Mr. Spencer,” she wailed. 
“Mr. Spencer, something aw- 
ful’s happened ! Remember 
Mr. Hudson?” 

She stepped back out of his 
way. He sprang inside and 
slammed the door behind him. 
“As if I ever could forget 
him,” he said bitterly. 

Said Miss Crane, “Mr. Hud- 
son’s dead!” 

Spencer stood stricken. 
Miss Crane raged, “If only 
you had seen him when I 

29 




wanted you to! If you hadn’t 
kept him waiting out 
there . 

*'Now, look here — ” 

'‘He got up finally,” said 
Miss Crane, “and his face was 
red. He was angry. I don’t 
blame him, Mr. Spencer.” 

“You mean he died right 
here?” 

“He said to me, ‘Tell your 
Mr. Spencer — ’ and that’s as 
far as he ever got. He sort 
of lurched and caught with 
his hand at the edge of the 
desk to support himself, but 
his hand slipped off and he 
folded up and . .” 

Spencer waited for no more. 
He went in three quick steps 
across the office and out into 
the reception room. 

There was Mr. Hudson, 
huddled on the carpet. 

He looked startlingly like a 
limp rag doll. One blue-veined 
hand was stretched out ahead 
of him. The portfolio that it 
had held lay just beyond the 
fingertips, as if even in his 
death Mr. Hudson might be 
stretching out his hand to it. 
His jacket was hunched across 
the shoulders. The collar of 
his white shirt, Spencer saw, 
was ragged. 

Spencer went slowly across 
the floor and knelt down be- 
side the man. He put his ear 
down on the body. 

There was no sound at all. 

SPENCER.” Miss 
Crane was standing in 
the doorway, still terrified but 

30 



enjoying it a lot. Not in all her 
years of being secretary had 
anything like this happened. 
Not in all her life. It would 
keep her supplied with con- 
versation for many, many 
years. 

“Lock the door,” said Spen- 
cer, “so no one can come stroll- 
ing in. Then phone the police.” 

“The police!” 

“Miss Crane,” said Spencer, 
sharply. 

She walked around him and 
the body on the floor, edging 
close against the wall. 

“Call Legal, too,” said Spen- 
cer. 

He stayed squatting on the 
floor, staring at the man who 
lay there and wondering how 
it had happened. Heart attack, 
most likely. Miss Crane had 
said that he looked ill — and 
had urged that he see him 
first, ahead of the other two. 

And if one were looking for 
a man to blame for what had 
happened here, Spencer told 
himself, they might have but 
little trouble fastening it on 
him. 

If Hudson had not had to 
wait, growing angrier and 
more upset as the time slip- 
ped past, this might not have 
happened. 

Hudson had waited in this 
room, a sick and impatient 
man, and finally an angry one 
— and what had he waited 
for? 

Spencer studied the rag-doll 
of a man slumped upon the 
carpet, the thinning hair atop 

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




his head, the thick-lensed 
spectacles bent and twisted in 
the fall, the bony, blue-veined 
hands. He wondered what 
such a man might have ex- 
pected from Past, Inc. 

Spencer started to get up 
and lost his balance as he did, 
his left hand going out behind 
him to prop himself erect. 

And beneath the spread-out 
palm there was something cool 
and smooth. Without looking, 
he knew what it was. Hud- 
son’s portfolio! 

The answer might be there! 

Miss Crane was at the door, 
locking it. There was no one 
else. 

With a swift sweep of his 
hand, Spencer skidded the 
portfolio in the direction of 
the doorway that led into his 
office. 

He got smoothly to his feet 
and turned. The portfolio lay 
halfway through the doorway. 
Jn one quick stride he reached 
it and nudged it with his foot, 
inside and out of sight. 

He heard the snick of the 
lock falling home and Miss 
Crane turned around. 

“The police first, or Legal, 
Mr. Spencer?” 

“The i3olice, I’d think,” said 
Spencer. 



H e stepped within his 
office and swung the door 
so that it came within an inch 
of closing. Then he snatched 
the portfolio off the floor and 
hui*ricd to his desk. 



He put it on his desk end 
zipped it open and there were 
three sheafs of papers, each 
of the sheafs paper-clipped 
together. 

The first bore the legend at 
the top of the first page: A 
Study of Ethics Involved in 
Traveling in Time, And after 
that page upon page of type- 
script, heavily underlined and 
edited with a neat red pencil. 

And the second, a thin one, 
with no legend, and composed 
of sheets of unneatly scribbled 
notes. 

And the third, once again 
typed, with carefully drawn 
diagrams and charts, and the 
heading: A New Concept of 
the Mechanics of Time Travel, 

Spencer sucked in his breath 
and bent above the paper, his 
eyes trying to gallop along the 
lines of type, but forced to go 
too fast to really catch the 
meaning. 

For he had to get the port- 
folio back where it had been 
and he had to do it without 
being seen. It was not his to 
touch. The police might be- 
come difficult if they found 
he’d rifled it. And when he put 
it back, it must have some- 
thing in it. A man would ha}*d- 
ly come to see him with an 
empty poi/tfolio. 

In the outer office, he heard 
Miss Crane talking. He made 
a quick decision. 

He swept the second and 
third sheaf of papers into the 
top drawer of his desk. Leav- 
ing the first sheaf on time- 

31 



GLEANERS 




travel ethics in the portfolio, 
he zipped it shut again. 

That would satisfy the cops. 
He held the portfolio in his 
left hand, letting his arm hang 
along his side, and stepped to 
the doorway, shielding the left 
side of his body and the port- 
folio. 

Miss Crane was on the 
phone her face turned away 
from him. 

He dropped the portfolio on 
the carpeting, just beyond the 
outstretched fingers of the 
dead man. 

Miss Crane put down the 
phone and saw him standing 
there. 

“The police will be right 
over,” she said. “Now Til call 
Mr. Hawkes in Legal.” 

“Thanks,” said Spencer, 
“ril go through some papers 
while we're waiting.” 

VII 

B ack at his desk, he took 
out the pile of papers that 
said: A Neiv Concept on the 
Mechanics of Time Travel. 
The name on it was Boone 
Hudson. 

He settled down to read, 
first with mounting wonder- 
ment, then with a strange, 
cold excitement — for here, at 
last, was the very thing that 
would at once erase the basic 
headache of Past, Inc. 

No longer would one face 
the nightmare of good travel- 
ers wearing out in a few 
years' time. 



No longer would a man go 
into time a young man and re- 
turn sixty seconds later with 
the beginning lines of age 
showing on his face. No longer 
would one watch one's friends' 
age visibly from month to 
month. 

For they would no longer be 
dealing in men, but in the pat- 
terns of those men. 

Matter transference, Spen- 
cer told himself. You could 
probably call it that, anyway. 
A man would be sent into the 
past; but the carrier would 
not move physically into time 
as it moved now. It would pro- 
ject a pattern of itself and the 
man within it, materializing 
at the target point. And with- 
in the carrier — the basic car- 
rier, the prime carrier, the 
parent carrier which would 
remain in present time — 
there'd be another pattern, a 
duplicate pattern of the man 
sent into time. 

When the man returned to 
present time, he would not re- 
turn as he was at that mo- 
ment in the past, but as the 
pattern within the waiting 
carrier said he had been when 
he'd traveled into time. 

He'd step out of the carrier 
exactly as he had stepped intij 
it, not older by a second — ac- 
tually a minute younger than 
he would have been! For he 
did not have to account for 
that sixty seconds between 
leaving and returning. 

For years. Past, Inc.'s, own 
research department had been 



32 



CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




seeking for the answer to the 
problem, without even coming 
close. And now a stranger had 
come unheralded and sat 
hunched in the reception 
room, with the portfolio cra- 
dled on his knee, and he had 
the answer, but he’d been 
forced to wait. 

He’d waited and he’d waited 
and finally he had died. 

There was a tapping at the 
door of the outer office. He 
heard Miss Crane cross the 
room to open it. 

Spencer pulled out a desk 
drawer and hurriedly shoved 
the papers into it. Then he 
stood up from the desk and 
walked around it to go into 
the outer office. 

R OSS HAWKES, head of 
Past, Inc.’s legal depart- 
ment, was standing just be- 
yond the body on the carpet, 
staring down at it. 

"Hello, Ross,’’ said Spencer. 
"An unpleasant business 
here.” 

Hawkes looked up at him, 
puzzled. His pale blue eyes 
glittered behind the neat and 
precise spectacles, his snow 
white hair matching the pallor 
of his face. 

“But what was Dan’l doing 
here?” he asked. 

“Dan’l?” Spencer demand- 
ed. “His name happened to be 
Boone Hudson.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Hawkes. 
“But the boys all called him 
Dan’l — Dan’l Boone, you un- 
derstand. Sometimes he didn’t 



like it. He worked in Research. 
We had to fire him, fifteen, 
sixteen years ago. "rhe only 
reason that I recognized him 
was that we had some trouble. 
He had an idea he would like 
to sue us.” 

Spencer nodded. “Thanks. I 
see,” he said. 

He was halfway to his office 
door when he turned back. 

“One thing, Ross. What did 
we fire him for ?” 

“I don’t recall exactly. He 
disregarded his assignment, 
went off on some other tan- 
gent. Matter transference, I 
think.” 

Spencer said, “That’s the 
way it goes.” 

He went back into the office, 
locked his desk and went out 
the back way. 

In the parking lot, he back- 
ed out his car and went slowly 
down the street. A police 
cruiser was parked in front of 
the building and two officers 
were getting out. An ambu- 
lance was pulling in behind 
the cruiser. 

So, thought Spencer, they 
had fired Hudson fifteen years 
ago, because he had some sort 
of crazy idea about matter 
transference and wouldn’t 
stick to business. And to this 
very day. Research was going 
quietly mad trying to solve a 
problem that Hudson could 
have put into their laps years 
ago, if they had kept him on. 

Spencer tried to imagine 
how those fifteen years must 
have been for Hudson, more 



GLEANERS

than likely working all the 
time on this quiet insanity of 
his. And how, finally, he had 
gotten it and had made sure of 
it and then had gone down to 
Past, Inc., to rub their noses 
in it. 

Exactly as he, Hallock 
Spencer, now would rub their 
noses in it. 

G reenwich street was a 
quiet residential street of 
genteel poverty, with small 
and older houses. Despite the 
smallness of the houses and 
their age, and in some cases 
their unkemptness, there was 
a certain solid pride and re- 
spectability about them. 

The address on the manu- 
script was 241 Greenwich. It 
was a squat brown house sur- 
rounded by a crumbling picket 
fence. The j^ard was full of 
flowers. Even so, it had the 
look of a house that had no one 
living in it. 

Spencer edged through the 
sagging gate and up the walk, 
made small by the flowers that 
encroached upon it. He went 
up the rickety stairs to the 
shaky porch and, since there 
was no bell, rapped on the 
closed front door. 

There was no answer. He 
tried the knob and it turned. 
He pushed the door part way 
open and edged into the silent 
hall. 

''Hello,” he called. "Anyone 
at home?” 

He waited. There wasn't. 
He walked front the hall 



into the living room and stood 
to look around him at the 
Spartan, almost monklike ex- 
istence of the man who'd lived 
there. 

It was evident that Hudson 
had lived alone, for the room 
bore all the signs of a lone 
man's camping. There was a 
cot against one w^all, a dirty 
shiii; flung across one end of it. 
Two pairs of shoes and a pair 
of slippers were lined up un- 
derneath the cot. An old-fash- 
ioned dresser stood opposite 
the cot. A handful of ties dan- 
gled raggedly from the bar 
that had been fastened on its 
side. A small kitchen table 
stood in the corner nearest to 
the kitchen. A box of crackers 
and a glass, still spotted with 
milk stains, stood upon the 
table. A massive desk stood a 
few feet from the table and 
the top of it was bare except 
for an old typewriter and a 
photograph in a stand-up 
frame. 

Spencer walked over to the 
desk and began pulling out the 
drawers. They were almost 
empty. In one he found a pipe, 
a box of paper clips, a stapler 
and a single poker chip. The 
others yielded other odds and 
ends, but nothing of impor- 
tance. In one was a half a 
ream of paper — but nowhere 
was there a single line of writ- 
ing. In the bottom drawer on 
the left hand side, he found 
a squat bottle, half full of good 
Scotch. 

And that was all.

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




He searched the dresser. 
Nothing but shirts and under- 
wear and socks. 

He prowled into the kitch- 
en. Just the built-in stove and 
refrigerator and the cup- 
boards. He found nothing in 
any of them but a small sup- 
ply of food. 

And the bedrooms — two of 
them — were empty, innocent 
of furniture, and with a fine 
and powdery dust coating 
floor and walls. Spencer stood 
in the doorway of each and 
looked and there was a sad- 
ness in each room. He didn’t 
go inside. 

Back in the living room, he 
went to the desk and picked 
up the photograph. A woman 
with a tired, brave smile, with 
a halo of white hair, with an 
air of endless patience, looked 
out of it at him. 

There was nothing to be 
found in this house, he told 
himself. Not unless one had 
the time to search every cor- 
ner of it, every crack, to take 
it down, each board and stone. 
And even then, he doubted 
now, there’d be anything to 
find. 

H e left the house and 
drove back to the office. 
“Your lunch didn’t take too 
long,” Miss Crane told him, 
sourly. 

“Evei-ything all right?” he 
asked. 

“The police were very, very 
nice,” she said. “Both Mr. 
Hawkes and Mr. Snell are 

GLEANERS 



anxious to see you. And Mr. 
Garside called.” 

“After a while,” said Spen- 
cer. “I’ve got work to do. 1 
don’t want to be disturbed.” 

He went into his office and 
shut the door with a gesture 
of finality. 

From the drawer he took 
the Hudson papers and settled 
down to read. 

He was no engineer, but he 
knew enough of it to make a 
ragged sort of sense, although 
at times he was forced to go 
back and read more carefully, 
or puzzle out a diagram that 
he’d skipped through too hur- 
riedly. Finally he came to the 
end of it. 

It was all there. 

It would have to be checked 
by technicians and engineers, 
of course. There might be 
bugs that would take some 
ironing out, but the concept, 
complete both in theory and 
in the theory’s application, 
was all there in the paper, 

Hudson had held nothing 
back — no vital point, no key. 

And that was crazy, Spen- 
cer told himself. You had to 
leave yourself some sort of 
bargaining position. You could 
trust no other man, certainly 
no corporation, as implicitly 
as Hudson apparently had in- 
tended to. Especially you 
couldn’t trust an outfit that 
had fired you fifteen years be- 
fore for working on this very 
concept. 

It was ridiculous and 
tragic, Spencer told himself 

35 




Past, Inc,, could not have 
even guessed what Hudson 
might have been aiming at. 
And Hudson, in his turn, was 
gagged because he’d not as 
yet progressed to a point 
where he could have faith 
either in his concept or him- 
self. Even if he had tried to 
tell them, they would have 
laughed at him, for he had no 
reputation to support such 
outrageous dreaming. 

Spencer sat at his desk, re- 
membering the house on 
Greenwich St., the huddling 
in one I’oom with the other 
rooms all bare and the entire 
house stripped of all evidence 
of comfort and good living. 
More than likely all the furni- 
ture in those rooms, all the 
accumulation of many years 
of living, had been sold, piece 
by precious piece, to keep 
groceries on the shelf. 

A man who was dedicated 
to a dream, Spencer told him- 
self, a man who had lived with 
that dream so long and inti- 
mately that it was his entire 
life. Perhaps he had known 
that he was about to die. 

That might explain his im- 
patience at being forced to 
wait. 

S PENCER shoved the Hud- 
son papers to one side and 
picked up the notes. The pages 
were filled with cryptic pen- 
ciled lines, with long strings 
of mathematical abstractions, 
roughly drawn sketches. They 
were no help. 

36 



And that other paper, Spen- 
cer wondered — the one he’d 
left in the portfolio, that one 
that had to do with ethics? 
Might it not also bear a close 
relationship to the Hudson 
concept? Might there not be 
in it something of importance 
bearing on this new approach ? 

Time travel perforce was 
hedged around with a pattern 
of ethics which consisted 
mainly of a formidable list of 
“thou shalt nots.” 

Thou shalt not transport a 
human being from the past. 

Thou shalt not snitch a 
thing until it has been lost. 

Thou shalt not inform any 
one in the past of the fact 
there is time travel. 

Thou shalt not interfere in 
any way with the patterns of 
the past. 

Thou shalt not try to go 
into the future — and don’t ask 
why, because that’s a dirty 
question.

T he buzzer sounded. He 
flipped up the switch. 
“Yes, Miss Crane.” 

“Mr. Garside is here to see 
you. Mr. Hawkes and Mr. 
Snell are with him.” 

He thought he detected in 
her voice a sense of satisfac- 
tion. 

“All right. Ask them to 
come in.” 

He gathered the papers off 
his desk and put them in his 
briefcase, then settled back as 

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




they came in. “Well, gentle- 
men. It seems I am invaded. 

Even as he said it, he knew 
it had not been the proper 
thing to say. They did not 
even smile. And he knew that 
it was bad. Any time you got 
Legal and Public Relations to- 
gether, it couldn't be anything 
but bad. 

They sat down. “We 
thought,” said Snell, in his 
most polished P.R. manner, 
“that if we got together and 
tried to talk things out . .” 
Hawkes cut him short. He 
said to Spencer, accusingly: 
“You have managed to place 
us in a most embarrassing 
position.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Spen- 
cer. “Let's tick off the items. 
One of my men brought back 
a human from the past. A man 
died in my office. I forgot to 
be polite to a stuffed shirt 
wlio came charging in to help 
us run our business.” 

“You seem,” said Garside, 
“to take it all quite lightly.” 
“Perhaps I do,” said Spen- 
cer. “Let's put it slightly 
stronger. I just don’t give a 
damn. You cannot allow pres- 
sure groups to form your 
policy.” 

“You are talking now, of 
course,” said Garside, “about 
the Ravenholt affair.” 

“Chris,” said Snell, enthusi- 
astically, “you hit it on the 
button. Here is a chance to 
really sell the public on us. 
1 don't believe we've really 
sold them. We are dealing in 

GLEANERS 



something which to the aver- 
age man seems to smell of 
magic. Naturally he is stand- 
offish.'' 

“More to the point," said 
Hawkes, impatiently, “if we 
turn down this project — 
this . .” 

“Project God,” said Spen- 
cer. 

“I’m not sure I like your 
phrasing." 

“Think up a name your- 
self,” said Spencer calmly. 
“That is what we call it.” 

“If we fail to go ahead with 
it, we'll be accused of being 
atheists.” 

“How would the public ever 
know that we turned it 
down?" asked Spencer. 

“You can be sure,” Snell 
said bitterly, “that Ravenholt 
will make a point of making 
known our turning down of 
it.” 

PENCER smashed his fist 
upon the desk in sudden 
anger. He yelled, “I told you 
how to handle Ravenholt!” 

“Hal,” Garside told him 
quietly, “we simply cannot do 
it. We have our dignity.” 

“No,” said Spencer, “I sup- 
pose you can't. But you can 
sell out to Ravenholt and 
whoever's backing him. You 
can rig the survey of religious 
origins. You can falsify re- 
ports.” 

The three of them sat in 
stricken silence. Spencer felt 
a twinge of momentary won- 
der for having dared to say it. 

37 




It was not the way one was 
supposed to talk to brass. 

But he had to say one more 
thing. "Chris. You are going 
to disregard the report I made 
and go ahead with it, aren’t 
you?” 

Garside answered with 
smooth urbanity : “I’m afraid 
I’ll have to.” 

Spencer looked at Hawkes 
and Snell and he saw the se- 
cret smiles that lurked just 
behind their lips — ^the sneer- 
ing contemptuous smile of 
authority ascendant. 

He said slowly, “Yes, I 
^ess you will. Well, it’s all 
in your laps now. You figure 
out the answers.” 

“But it’s your department.” 
“Not any more, it isn’t. I’ve 
just quit the job.” 

“Now see here, Hal,” Gar- 
side was saying, “you can’t 
do a thing like that! Without 
any notice ! Just flying off the 
liandle ! We may have our 
little differences, but that is 
no excuse ...” 

“I’ve decided,” Spencer told 
him, “that I somehow have to 
stop you. I cannot allow you 
to go ahead with Project God. 
1 warn you, if you do, that I 
shall discredit you. I shall 
prove exactly and without 
(luestion everything you’ve 
done. And meanwhile, I am 
jdanning to go into business 
ior myself.” 

‘'^IME travel, perhaps.” 
A They were mocking him. 
“I had thought of it.” 

38 



Snell grinned contemptu- 
ously. “You can’t even get a 
license.” 

“I think I can,” said Spen- 
cer. 

And he knew he could. 
With a brand new concept, 
there’d be little trouble. 

Garside got up from his 
chair. “Well,” he said to Spen- 
cer, “you’ve had your little 
tantrum. When you cool down 
a bit, come up and talk to me.” 

Spencer shook his head. 

“Goodbye, Chris,” he said. 

He did not rise. He sat and 
watched them go. 

Strangely, now that it was 
over — or just beginning — 
there was no tenseness in him. 
It had fallen all away and he 
felt abiding calm. 

There was money to be 
raised, there were technicians 
and engineers to hire, there 
were travelers to be found and 
trained, and a whole lot more 
than that. 

Thinking of it all, he had a 
momentary pang of doubt, but 
he shrugged it off. He got up 
from his chair and walked out 
into the office. 

“Miss Crane,” he said, “Mr. 
Cabell was supposed to come 
back this afternoon.” 

“I haven’t seen him, sir.” 

"Of course not,” Spencer 
said. 

For suddenly it all seemed 
to be coming clear, if he only 
could believe it. 

There had been a look in 
young Cabell’s eyes that had 
been most disturbing. And 

CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




now, all at once, he knew that 
look for exactly what it was. 
It had been adulation! 



T he kind of look that was 
reserved for someone who 
had become a legend. 

And he must be wrong, 
Spencer told himself, for he 
was not a legend — at least not 
at the moment. 

There had been something 
else in young Cabell's eyes. 
And once again he knew. Ca- 
bell had been a young man, 
but the eyes had been old 
eyes. They were eyes that had 
seen much more of life than 
a man of thirty had any right 
to see. 

“What shall I say," asked 
Miss Crane, “if he should 
come back?" 

“Never mind," said Spen- 
cer. am sure he won't." 

For Cabell's job was done, 
if it had been a job at all. It 
might have been, he told him- 
self, a violation of the ethics, 
a pure piece of meddling, or it 
might have been a yielding to 
that temptation to play God. 

Or, he thought, it might 
have been all planned. 

Had they somewhere in the 
future worked out that formu- 
la he'd spoken of to Cabell — 
the formula that would allow 
legitimate manipulation of the 
past ? 

“Miss Crane," he said, 
“would you be kind enough to 
type up a resignation for me? 
Effective immediately. Make it 

GLEANERS 



very formal. I am sore at 
Garside." 

Miss Crane did not bat an 
eyelash. She ran paper into 
her machine. 

“Mr. Spencer, what reason 
shall I give?" 

“You might say I'm going 
into business for myself." 

Had there been another 
time, he wondered, when it 
hadn't gone this way? Had 
there been a time when Hud- 
son had gotten in to see him 
and maybe had not died at all? 
Had there been a time when 
he'd handed over the Hudson 
concept to Past, Inc., instead 
of stealing it himself? 

And if Cabell had not been 
here to take up the time, more 
than likely he would have got- 
ten around to seeing Hudson 
before it was too late. And if 
he had seen the man, then it 
was more than likely that he 
would have passed the con- 
cept on through proper chan- 
nels. 

But even so, he wondered, 
how could they be sure (who- 
ever they might be) that he'd 
not see Hudson first? He re- 
called distinctly that Miss 
Crane had urged that he see 
him first. 

And that was it, he thought 
excitedly. That was exactly it ! 
He might very well have seen 
Hudson first if Miss Crane 
had not been insistent that he 
should. 

And standing there, he 
thought of all the years that 
Miss Crane must have worked 

39 




at it — conditioning him to the 
point where he’d be sure to do 
exactly opposite to what she 
urged he do. 

‘‘Mr. Spencer,” said Miss 
Crane, “I have the letter fin- 
ished. And there is something 
else. I almost forgot about it.” 

She reached down into a 
drawer and took out some- 
thing and laid it on the desk. 

It was the portfolio that 
belonged to Hudson. 

“The police,” said Miss 
Crane, “apparently overlook- 
ed it. It was very careless of 
them. I thought that you 
might like it.” 

Spencer stood staring 
blankly at it. 

“It would go so nicely,” said 
Miss Crane, “with the other 
stuff you have.” 

T here was a muted 
thumping on the floor and 
Spencer spun around. A white 
rabbit with long and droopy 
ears hopped across the carpet, 
looking for a carrot. 

“Oh, how cute!” cried Miss 
Crane, very much unlike her- 
self. “Is it the one that Mr. 
Nickerson sent back?” 

“It’s the one,” said Spencer. 
“I had forgotten it.” 

“Might I have it?” 

“Miss Crane. I wonder . 
“Yes, Mr. Spencer?” 

And what was he to say ? 
Could he blurt out that now 
he knew she was one of them ? 

It would take so much ex- 
planation and it could be so 
involved. And, besides. Miss 



Crane was not the sort of 
person that you blurted out 
things to. 

He gulped. “I was wonder- 
ing, Miss Crane, if you’d come 
and work for me. I’ll need a 
secretary.” 

Miss Crane shook her head. 
“No, I’m getting old. I’m 
thinking of retiring. I think, 
now that you are leaving, I 
shall just disappear.” 

“But, Miss Crane, I’ll need 
you desperately.” 

“One of these days soon,” 
said Miss Crane, “when you 
need a secretary, there’ll be an 
applicant. She’ll wear a bright 
green dress and she’ll be wear- 
ing these new glasses and be 
carrying a snow-white rabbit 
with a bow around its neck. 
She may strike you as some- 
thing of a hussy, but you hire 
her. Be sure you hire her,” 

“I’ll remember,” Spencer 
said. “I’ll be looking for her. 
I’ll hire no one else.” 

“She will not,” warned Miss 
Crane, “be a bit like me. She’ll 
be much nicer.” 

“Thank you. Miss Crane,” 
said Spencer, just a bit in- 
anely. 

“And don’t forget this,” 
said Miss Crane, holding out 
the portfolio. 

He took it and headed for 
the door. 

At the door he stopped and 
turned back to her. 

“I’ll be seeing you,” he said. 

For the first time in fifteen 
years. Miss Crane smiled at 
him, END

By RAYMOND E. BANKS 

Certainly a spaceship should he a home away from home 
— but for so many centuries? 



I NSTRUCTOR John Marsden vard University. He had 
could almost feel his luck as grown up to be a New Har- 
a tangible, living thing. He vard instructor. He had want- 
had wanted, as a young man, ed to marry a sweet and 
to be a teacher at New Har- attractive girl and have a 



41 





handsome, healthy family. He 
had married such a girl, and 
his young son gave every evi- 
dence of being good-looking, 
enormously healthy, and quick 
of mind. He had wanted to go 
out into space — once. And look 
at what had happened. 

Each year the university 
sent out a spaceship of its 
most promising young stu- 
dents in their senior year on a 
tour to the Moon. It was a 
great honor to get an assign- 
ment on the Yard, John Mars- 
den was the only first-year 
instructor chosen to go along 
with the voyage of 2248. 

And then that incredible 
thing: the revelation by the 
three scientists who managed 
the ship that the Yard had 
been converted with New Har- 
vard's still-secret space warp, 
the first ever developed — and 
would make man's first at- 
tempt at an interstellar cross- 
ing! With, of course, the 
consent of the five hundred 
students and instructors 
aboard. How did they vote? 

The vote was unanimous. 
The Moon, indeed! This tour 
by the class of 2248 would be 
forever remembered by man- 
kind. Of course it would only 
be a short, safe run to Alpha 
Centauri, a mere four light- 
years away, but such a trip 
would immortalize the entire 
passenger list. 

And so the Yard went into 
man's first space drive. 

Seventy light-years from 
Earth, near the star Regulus, 

42 



the Yard crash-landed on an 
unnamed planet. You would 
think that it was the end for 
the starry-eyed young men 
and women and the overly con- 
fident, proud inventors of the 
warp. 

But Johnny Marsden didn't 
think so. Nothing really bad 
had ever happened to him — 
yet. 

S ITTING in the control room 
of the motionless Yard 
with a girl student, Elizabeth 
Simms, Marsden nevertheless 
felt the heavy gloom of those 
around him. 

'‘Do you think we'll ever get 
back to Earth ?" asked the girl, 
trying to keep hysteria out of 
her voice. 

"Certainly," said John. He 
was thinking of his wife, 
Sylvia, and young Tim, 70 
light-years away, playing in 
his playpen, laughing, romp- 
ing in the warm afternoon 
sunshine. 

He looked down at his 
hands. John Marsden was 
hexadactyllic, a physical curi- 
osity, but he had always con- 
nected that extra thumb with 
his luck. The smaller second 
thumb, springing from the 
thumb root, didn't disfigure 
him — it only made him a little 
different, a little more con- 
vinced of superiority. Not 
that he needed it. 

"Of course we'll reach 
Earth," he said. 

"But if no other spaceship 
has a warp, it might be a 

RAYMOND E. BANKS 




1-long time before we’re — 
we’re rescued.” 

John patted her shoulder. 
He lifted her from her chair 
and took her to the port, to 
look out on the landing space. 
The Yard had come to rest on 
a small, gray-green island in 
the middle of a dismal ocean 
on one of the planets of Regu- 
lus. 

“Look,” said John. “The 
ship could’ve blown apart in 
space. It didn’t. It could’ve 
killed us all in landing. It 
didn’t. We could’ve been 
forced to land in the middle of 
the ocean on this planet. We 
weren’t.” 

“Well, yes, but — ” 

“Also, this island has fresh 
water. It has grass and trees 
of a sort, and a promising 
Earthlike soil. That means 
oxygen and forage for the 
ship’s livestock. Even if we 
have to stay here a year or 
two, we can survive, because 
we can breathe, quench our 
thirst, grow food and live in 
the ship for shelter.” 

Two tears crept out of the 
girl’s eyes. “But we’re so far 
from Earth!” 

He put his arm around her 
shoulders. The golden New 
Harvard hair-style seemed 
fantestic out here in space. 
“With all that string of coin- 
cidences, do you think we can 
possibly perish ? Why, we may 
be able to fix the ship up in a 
few days, and be back with a 
wonderful story to tell at 
graduation.” 

TO BE CONTINUED 



“But Professor Leonard 
said we’re horribly hampered 
for tools.” 

John Marsden released the 
girl with a sigh. He looked 
again at his curious thumbs. 
He thought of his own son, 
back on Earth, also with the 
extra thumb, putting his small 
hand in his father’s. He re- 
membered the warm touch. He 
thought of sweet, grave Syl- 
via’s face, and tried to imag- 
ine not seeing her or Timmy 
any more. 

No. He couldn’t believe it. 
They were in an unpleasant, 
even desperate position, but he 
was Johnny Marsden. He 
would be saved — they would 
all be saved, in spite of Pro- 
fessor Leonard’s pessimism. 
Because all five hundred peo- 
ple walked under the umbrella 
of Johnny Marsden’s luck. 
And with plenty of atomic 
power available — 

“Don’t worry, Elizabeth,” 
he told the girl. “We’re going 
back to Earth. Everything 
will be all right.” 

The words echoed on the 
shining walls, on the new- 
treaded floor, on the thick, 
sparkling glass of the porthole 
of the Yard. 

F our hundred years later, 
Johnny Marsden XIV, 
standing in the Class Presi- 
dent’s room of the Yard, said: 
“Don’t worry, sir. Everjd;hing 
will be all right now. I’m sure 
of it.” 

"Son,” said Leonard XIII, 

43 




"it won't be — because there is 
no Earth!" 

The walls were dim, cor- 
roded by the sea air. The floor 
was worn to a gray-black 
muck by the moving feet of 
generations. The glass in the 
porthole had been gone for 
more than a century, and a bit 
of wool that had once stuffed 
the hole was now a rag. 

The man and the boy stood 
looking down on the Univer- 
sity, and the man repeated 
sadly: “No Earth." 

“No Earth!" cried Johnny. 
“All the ancient lore you've 
told me — " 

“Merely tales," said Leon- 
ard. “And I even misled you 
into Graduation before your 
time. No. Tomorrow we of the 
Class of 2648 die, and now 
you'll have to die with us, 
unless — " 

Johnny looked down at the 
yellow fires. Bonfires tonight, 
in honor of tomorrow's Grad- 
uation. The rich, delightful 
smell of roasting pigs and 
sheep rose in the air. Tonight 
was the lavish, luxurious feast 
of the year, a time of great- 
ness. 

But also the five Arrowmen 
were practicing hard, sending 
their shafts into carcasses — 
sheep carcasses tonight. 

Johnny drew his rough gray 
sheep cape around himself and 
shivered. For the last two 
weeks he had felt the growing 
change in his adopted Class, 
the Class of 2648. Graduation 
and return to Earth was sup- 



posed to be a time of happiness 
— but the Class did not seem 
happy. Was this the inherent; 
nature of old people ? He look-’ 
ed up at Leonard, the Class 
President. The man was an- 
cient, at least thirty-one, and 
he was frowning now. 

“But, sir," said Johnny, “of 
all the people in the Class, you 
believed the most — that 
Earthmen would be waiting 
for us at the end of Gradua- 
tion Walk." 

“1 have developed a new 
theory,” said Leonard bleakly. 

Johnny could tell the old 
man (he actually had some 
lines on his face) was worried 
about tomorrow and how it 
would be. 

Tomorrow the Class of 2648 
would assemble on Commence- 
ment Hill. They would stand 
before the narrow stone path- 
way called Graduation Walk. 
It protruded from the high 
side of the island into the per- 
petual fog, a fateful finger of 
rock to the Graduates. For 
when you reached the proper 
age, you Graduated, walking 
along the stone path and dis- 
appearing into the mists, 
wearing your ceremonial 
wings that were to fly you to 
the waiting Earth ship below. 

Tradition had it that the 
Earth ship waited to take you 
back to a miraculous land in 
the stars to live a long, won- 
derful life in a dazzling civili- 
zation. No one had ever come 
back from the Walk to say 
whether or not this was true 



44

— that the wings would fly you 
down to the waiting Earth 
ship, or that the ship would be 
there. 

But to Johnny that made 
good sense. It would destroy 
the morale of the other island- 
ers to have a Graduate return 
with tales of a fine new life. 
They would want to leave the 
island before their time. 

He knew that some believed 
no Earth ship waited for the 
Graduates, that Graduation 
Walk was just a natural stone 
fonnation, mysterious, perpet- 
ually covered with fog, but a 
mere trap. You would flutter 
sadly down to the ocean and 
die on the lonely sea. 

Truly it was hard to know ! 
Once there had been books and 
papers on the home ship that 
had given accounts of Earth. 
But through the centuries they 
had been worn to powder. And 
the rough writings on sheep- 
skin parchments had been re- 
interpreted so often that it 
sometimes seemed you couldn’t 
separate truth from imagina- 
tion. 

J OHNNY believed the Earth 
ship theory. He even be- 
lieved that the Earthmen were 
testing them, to leave so much 
in doubt. But it was a shock to 
hear that Leonard, who had 
always professed the tradi- 
tions, had turned against them 
on the eve of Graduation. 

“But this great home ship !” 
cried Johnny. "The Mystic 
Radio that runs forever ! The 



legends ! They must mean , 
something!” 

Leonard took Johnny to the 
porthole and pointed out. It 
was dusk now and the stars, 
the few that showed through 
the rifts in the foggy island, 
were shining. 

“It’s too fantastic to sup- 
pose that Earth life exists out 
there,” said Leonard. “Why, 
those stars are an incredible 
distance. Perhaps as much as 
five hundred miles — an infinity 
no mind can conceive.” 

The five-mile-square island 
seemed large to Johnny. The 
five-hundred-mile figure made 
his head spin. “Well, yes, 
sir — ” 

“Emotionally, I hope for it,” 
said Leonard, almost as if 
pleading with Johnny. “But 
logically, no. I have always 
had doubts, and in these last 
few weeks it has resulted in 
a new theoiy.” 

He went to the ship’s wall 
and tapped it. “Notice how 
thick the hull of the home ship 
is. Strong enough to have ex- 
isted in water. That’s the key, 
Johnny. I have speculated that 
men once lived beneath this 
great ocean. This was the true 
Earth of legend. Then some 
gigantic catastrophe destroyed 
their sea-world. Only a few 
survived, the Ancient Five 
Hundred. They built this ship 
in the foreknowledge of the 
catastrophe. They came up on 
dry land. But since they could 
not live out of water, they 
brought the ocean with them 

45 



TO BE CONTINUED 




— water sealed in this great 
ship like a sealed sheepskin 
bag. Then gradually, over the 
years, they accustomed them- 
selves to living on the dry 
land.” 

“And the Graduates tomor- 
row won’t be picked up by 
Earth ships?” 

“Worse than that, Johnny, 
We can no longer live in wa- 
ter, Witness how easily we 
drown when we try to swim in 
the ocean. With no one to pick 
us up, we’ll perish tomorrow.” 
“And the Mystic Radio?” 
“The messages you send fall 
on dead ears. No, Johnny, I 
fear that the Graduation tra- 
dition serves a less ideal, more 
practical purpose. It removes 
the old so the young may live. 
This island can support three 
thousand at the most. And peo- 
ple do not die fast enough to 
make room for the newborn. 
That is why we must Gradu- 
ate.” 

“I wish you hadn’t told me 
this,” said Johnny. 

“I had my reasons. You are 
only eighteen, Johnny. Your 
time is not up yet for many 
years, I have arranged a re- 
prieve for you with the Class 
Presidents’ Council. You do 
not have to Graduate with the 
Class of 2648.” 

Johnny looked stunned. 
“But I’ve already enjoyed my 
love mating with Evelyn 
Soames of your Class. And 
I’ve been your Class Keyman 
on the Mystic Radio — ” 
Leonard nodded. “We were 

46 



glad to have you, Johnny, But 
you must not waste your life 
on us. You must not Graduate 
tomorrow." 

And Leonard gave him a re- 
assuring smile and a pat on 
the shoulder and eased him 
out, for a Senior Class Presi- 
dent was very busy on the eve 
of Graduation. 

Johnny left the President’s 
cabin, saddened. He had been 
so sure of a glorious future on 
Earth. And now his good 
friend Leonard didn’t believe 
Earth existed. Was it possi- 
ble 

No ! The Earth ship theory 
was right. He was Johnny 
Marsden. He had always en- 
joyed life, always been lucky ! 

E velyn soames awaited 

Johnny in the Key Room. 
She assisted him with the 
duties of Keyman, because she 
was the only other member of 
the Class of 2648 who had the 
necessary light touch. There 
had been many likely candi- 
dates for Keyman in Johnny’s 
own Class, and so he had prac- 
tically forced his way into 
Leonard’s and Evelyn’s Class, 
where no males; had the light 
touch he had. In that way he 
could make sure of winning 
the very high honor of the 
Keyman’s post. And tradition 
was generous about letting 
you go ahead of your time. 

“Hello, Johnny. Here are 
your ceremonial wings.” 
Johnny had made the wings 
for himself and Evelyn; she 

RAYMOND E. BANKS 




had decorated them. She had 
painted his bright blue and 
red and orange. The sight of 
the cheerful wings made him 
feel better, and she had been 
lavish with the scarce clay col- 
ors. More lavish on his than 
her own. 

“Thank you, Evelyn,” he 
said. “But you should’ve saved 
some of the colors for your- 
self.” 

She shrugged, a shoulder 
escaping from her formless 
sheepskin. 

“It doesn’t matter, Johnny.” 

“You, too,” he said. “Don’t 
tell me you no longer believe!” 

“No, Johnny, I believe. I 
believe . .” 

She came into his arms and 
he felt her soft body shiver. 
Evelyn had been both his de- 
light and his dismay. She was 
more than ten years older than 
he, yet young-minded enough 
to attract him, make him feel 
older. She was a handsome 
woman. He would never forget 
the holy night of mating, her 
skin gleaming from the tradi- 
tional bacon-oil massage, ut- 
terly desirable. 

And yet somehow Johnny 
knew it had been a mistake. It 
hadn’t been the true love he’d 
first thought, but a tempoi'aiy 
interest. What better proof 
than that she had produced no 
child for him? And he had 
used up his mating privilege ; 
he could never mate again. 

Now, as she gave him a 
fear-tinged, passionless kiss, 
he understood that she, too, 

TO BE CONTINUED 



no longer believed the Earth 
ship theory. 

Johnny felt his insides turn. 
He had counted on the help of 
Leonard and the reassurance 
of Evelyn to make this Gradu- 
ation an unforgettably fine 
experience. Instead it was be- 
coming a nightmare. 

J OHNNY turned quickly 
away and went to the Mys- 
tic Radio. He had no right to 
expect them to believe the 
theory just to make it easier 
for him. Faith was something 
built inside or not at all. 

Still, if only the people he 
loved would keep the confi- 
dence they’d had six months 
ago . 

He ran his fingers lovingly 
over the plate of the enclosed 
Radio cabinet, “caution,” it 
read, “atomic power, no re- 
placements NEEDED. DO NOT 
REMOVE COVER.” 

No one had ever removed 
the cover. And the Mystic Ra- 
dio still worked after all these 
centuries. 

Here was proof that Earth 
existed. No such miracle could 
have been created on this is- 
land of fog, forest, grasslands, 
sheep and pig pens and crude 
rock huts. 

He started to do his job, but 
Evelyn laid a hand on his arm. 
“Johnny,” she said, “Leonard 
spoke of a reprieve for you. 
Please — don’t Graduate with 
us.” 

He couldn’t stand her 
haunted eyes. Why, you’d 

47 




think tomorrow was an execu- 
tion ! 

He shook his head wordless- 
ly and snapped on the Radio. 
He felt the satisfying surge 
of power, the wonderful mag- 
netic metal affinity of the code 
key for its base, and he rever- 
ently began to pound out his 
eternal message. 

It was eternal, he thought. 
A message flung to Earth once 
a month for all these long cen- 
turies. Three dots, three 
dashes, three dots, as the book 
(long since worn out) had or- 
dered. 

SOS, SOS, SOS. No spacing 
between those mystic letters. 

Evelyn murmured the tradi- 
tional words of blessing to go 
v/ith the message. But her 
heart wasn't in it. And when 
they were done for the last 
time, in this room that they 
had made bright with so much 
fun and hope during the last 
year, she turned and fled, and 
he suddenly understood that 
she was sick with the fear of 
death. 

He sat alone for a long time 
in the twilight, the Mystic Ra- 
dio turned off. A dead home 
ship from a dead civilization 
under the seas, Leonard had 
said. A few brief moments of 
a pleasant life — then extinc- 
tion on the ocean tomorrow. 
That was what Leonard and 
Evelyn believed. 

What did he believe? 

He looked at his hand, that 
hand with the extra thumb 
that he had inherited. He had 



always believed it was a thumb 
of luck. 

But Leonard had so easily 
explained the home ship mira- 
cles. And Evelyn had so 
graphically imparted her ter- 
ror. 

Johnny began to shiver, and 
he could not stop. 

^^'yHE radio said ‘SOS' 

JL again today," said Marie. 

Sylvia Lowden nodded 
gloomily. "On this planet 
‘SOS.' On the last one ‘alal,' 
and on the one before that 
‘brx.' I’m disgusted!" 

Marie stared at Sylvia's 
hands as the girl instrument 
technician went on tabulating 
her data. Those hands fasci- 
nated Marie, because Sylvia 
had extra thumbs. Sylvia as a 
person interested her, because 
she told a story of some an- 
cestor that had been lost on a 
spaceship out here near Regu- 
lus and now, maybe, wuh a 
little luck they could turn up 
some wreckage, at least. 

‘‘But Reguliis was only the 
educated guess of an astro- 
historian," sighed Sylvia. ‘‘No 
one knew how that ship trav- 
eled after it passed Centauri 
on that wild ride. They played 
with a power they didn't un- 
derstand and wouldn't be 
played with." 

‘‘Well, anyv^ay, here we are 
among the thirty planets of 
Regulus," said Marie, ‘‘if you 
count the small ones." 

‘‘And each and every one of 
them seems to have its own 



48 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 




pseudo-radio signals,” groaned 
Sylvia. 

It had been fun for the girls 
at first, the search for evi- 
dence of the Yard that would 
clear up another entry in the 
“Register of Missing Space- 
ships.” And, as Sylvia explain- 
ed it, this would be a brilliant 
find, since the Yard had been 
the first ship ever to use a 
space warp. It had taken off 
from New Harvard over four 
hundred years ago and never 
been heard from again. It 
would be quite a feat for the 
team of feminine scan techni- 
cians on a routine evaluation 
patrol to bring back definite 
information. 

But their real job was to 
jockey the large instrument 
platform around each planet, 
letting the instruments gather 
data for later exploration by 
the research company that 
hired them. And they had a 
schedule to maintain. So each 
side investigation of some 
strange radio or visual phe- 
nomenon cost them precious 
time. They were spending less 
than the minimum ten hours 
on each of the planets to make 
up the time they’d lost. Sylvia 
had had her fill. 

“Don’t you want to look into 
this matter of the SOS ?” ask- 
ed Marie. 

“No,” said Sylvia. “In the 
firet place, the starship dis- 
tress signal is QX. In the sec- 
ond place, there couldn’t be 
living, survivors after ten 
years, let alone four hundred. 

TO BE CONTINUED 



Look — all fog and water ! Test 
that air. It depresses you just 
to smell it.” 

“But maybe there’s some 
land somewhere.” 

“If so, it’s well-hidden,” 
said Sylvia. 

S HE peered out of the port 
of the small cruiser. The 
fog opened below to show drab 
sea waves. A white bird drift- 
ed slowly and majestically 
across the open space and dis- 
appeared into the gray-white 
fog. 

“There’s a bird,” said 
Marie. “That means land and 
maybe some wreckage — or 
even survivors!” 

“No, no, no!” said Sylvia. 
“We can’t delay any more. I’ve 
chased rainbows, purple lights 
at night, animal cries that 
could be human — even strange 
smells — not to mention those 
pseudo-radio signals. In a 
word, to hell with the Yard. It 
probably blew up somewhere 
in space.” 

Marie leaned back in her 
comfortable seat and said with 
a sigh, “Has QX alw'ays been 
the distress signal ?” 

“Oh, for God’s sake,” said 
Sylvia. “I don’t know. If you 
are interested, look it up in 
NavHistory.” 

“I’m too comfortable. That 
chase after the radio signal 
‘alal’ on the last planet wore 
me out.” 

“And it turned out to be a 
metallic insect, rubbing its 
legs together in a mating call,” 



49 




said Sylvia. “An insect no big- 
ger than my thumb.” 

“Well, no bigger than my 
thumb,” amended Marie. “Go 
on, look up the SOS. Maybe 
it’ll turn out to be the mating 
call of two handsome, well- 
built young humanoid men.” 

“I will not look it up,” said 
Sylvia, getting up and starting 
to close off the instruments. 
“We’ve got one more planet to 
do. Then we rejoin the fleet 
and I g;o home with a lot less 
romantic notion of hunting for 
lost spaceships than I left 
Earth with.” 

She jabbed the motor studs 
viciously and the patrol craft 
jerked at the sudden release 
of power. The self-closing in- 
strument platform they towed 
began to fold, ready for space 
flight — and all the books tum- 
bled off the shelf above the 
radio desk. 

“Damnation!” said Sylvia. 

Marie grinned, opened one 
lazy eye. 

“You might as well look up 
SOS in NavHistory,” she said. 
“After all, your ill temper 
bounced it on the floor.” 

J OHNNY stood with the 
Class of 2648 on Com- 
mencement Hill in front of 
Graduation Walk. In a few 
moments the Senior Class 
President of 2649 would de- 
clare it dawn, and it would be 
time to Graduate. 

Johnny stared at the begin- 
nings of Graduation Walk, 
where it narrowed down and 



disappeared into the fog. He 
had had bad dreams about this 
moment last night, when he 
had slept at all. 

His classmates believed the 
Earth ship would be there. 
But they had listened to Leon- 
ard by firelight — and Leonard 
by firelight was most convinc- 
ing! He had said they would 
be saved, just the opposite of 
what he told Johnny. 

They did not know the Leon- 
ard of the President’s cabin, 
the man who did not believe 
anything lay ahead but death. 
Why had Leonard told Johnny 
what he really thought? Why 
couldn’t he have let Johnny go 
on believing? 

But, of course, he wanted 
Johnny to stay behind. 

Didn’t he realize that John- 
ny couldn’t stay behind? John- 
ny had used up his one 
allowable mating. He had had 
his honors. In any other Class 
he’d be a hanger-on . and 
worse, no matter how long he 
lived, the certainty of belief 
could never be restored. 

And Evelyn. She had noth- 
ing to say to him at all. Cheeks 
flushed, laughter on her lips, 
she helped Leonard fool their 
Class, pretending her fear was 
joy, her nervousness an eager- 
ness. 

Johnny glared at them now, 
but they were playing their 
worthless masquerade to the 
end, cheering the Class. And 
he couldn’t even unmask them, 
for who would believe young 
Johnny? 



50 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 




Lucky thumb? Johnny 
stared at his hands. Good 
luck? Damn bad luck! 

Now fathers and mothers 
had said last good-bys and the 
Class formed up. Johnny 
stared at them, wondering 
morbidly which ones believed, 
which knew the truth. There 
were always cynics, but here- 
tofore Johnny had, like the 
most of the islanders, consid- 
ered this small minority odd. 

Apparently the leaders 
themselves felt this way. 

U nobtrusively the Ar- 

rowmen moved out and 
hastened the last good-bys. It 
became silent, and Johnny 
could hear the dismal ocean 
below, pounding on the rocks. 

The new Senior Class Presi- 
dent raised his hand, the music 
began, and Leonard, with a 
reassuring smile, began to call 
out the names. 

Arlington was called first. 
He wore the usual ceremonial 
wings, made of tree branches 
and chicken feathers. He 
marched to the thin piping 
music and drum beat along the 
finger of rock that disappear- 
ed into the fog. The last they 
sa,w of him, he was trying his 
wings, hoping to start flying 
to Earth at any moment. 

There was no sound after 
the swirling fog closed in on 
him. 

Johnny shivered. It was 
Evelyn’s turn next. Johnny 
felt his breath grow short as 
she began her Walk. Her final 



kiss had been cold and trem- 
bling. Johnny clenched his 
fists, feeling a wrongness. 

She slipped once on the wet 
rock and a great “Oh!” went 
up from the crowd. An Arrow- 
man lifted his bow and John- 
ny’s horrified cry of “No!” 
was lost in the music and the 
swelling murmur. 

Evelyn cast a desperate look 
over her shoulder and ran 
along the path into the fog. 
But before she disappeared, 
she slipped again and fell off 
the stone path, and the sight 
of her fall toward the sharp 
rocks three hundred feet be- 
low almost drove the blood 
from Johnny’s brain. Her 
wings were useless, her death 
certain. If you fell instead of 
flying, you were not worthy of 
the return to Earth, the legend 
said. 

Johnny sat suddenly down 
on the ground. So much for 
the luck of the woman he 
loved. 

Leonard read off Sedley’s 
name. The man was a bluster- 
er, Johnny thought. He had 
volunteered for the first ten 
for the prestige, not because 
he had true courage. 

Sedley walked out boldly 
enough to the edge of the fog. 
Then he turned back, crying, 
“I have a final word that I 
must say!” 

But his base ruse to gain a 
few seconds’ more life failed. 
His mouth hung in shock as 
the Arrowman loosed a shaft. 
It took Sedley in the heart. He 



TO BE CONTINUED 



51 




gave a gigantic roar of pain 
and fell off the Walk. 

Johnny could feel the arrow 
in his own breast and had to 
gulp air to breathe. Would 
they all go as badly? 

Then kindly old Kentner, 
fragile, sunken-chested, al- 
ways in poor health, said in 
disgust, “Oh, we can do better 
than this!” 

And he walked out to the 
edge of the Walk firmly and 
disappeared into the mists. He 
earned a cheer. 

Johnny licked his dry lips. 
He tried to remember he didn’t 
have to go. 

T he cheer for Kentner 
spurred the others and 
they went fast, paying little 
attention to Leonard’s name 
reading. 

It was not uncommon for 
the undergraduates to catch 
the fever of the Graduation, 
stirred by the music and brav- 
ery. One Class had inspired at 
least fifty not scheduled to 
Graduate to rush down the 
Walkway without wings. 

The Class of 2648 was no 
exception, after its bad begin- 
ning. Some stumbled, a few 
screamed, one laughed, but 
most went silently, their eyes 
shining in hope. Only a few 
had to be shot, and some who 
had parents in the Class boldly 
followed after them into tlie 
fog. 

When it was nearly over, 
Leonard turned and held out 
his hand. “It was well done. 



Johnny. Aren’t you proud of 
your Class?” 

Johnny ignored the hand. 
“You lied to them all,” he said. 

“Yes, Johnny. I had to. All 
leaders lie, but the great ones 
believe their own tales. Life is 
built on hope; hope must al- 
ways be there — so men can 
live honestly and die glorious- 
ly — always allowing that first 
lie.” 

“I hate you,” said Johnny. 

"It was my hope to give you 
more years of life,” said 
Leonard. Then he was gone, 
moving swiftly down the 
Walkway, smiling, waving as 
if in a few seconds he would 
step easily into the waiting 
Earth ship. The crowd cheer- 
ed. 

Johnny felt a hot rage. To 
the last they all thought this 
liar was a fine man I 

A hand touched his. The 
new Senior Class President. 
“I am about to close the Grad- 
uation. But you don’t have to 
go. Leonard has arranged it.” 

Johnny pulled on his har- 
ness and adjusted his wings, 
almost too angry to speak. “He 
has arranged it so I may not 
stay!” And he went quickly 
down the Walk. 

Leonard had tried to save 
him useless years. He couldn’t 
live without hope. 

The Walk ended abruptly 
and Johnny knew what it was 
like to be alone, standing at the 
end of creation. Out here you 
couldn’t hear the music, only 
the bleak sound of the sea 



52 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 




breaking on the rocks far 
below. 

He groaned. Now he could 
not return without being shot. 
He had to go on, and yet — 
Could Leonard have been 
wrong? 

He was surprised to see that 
he had suddenly stepped into 
thin air. 

I T WAS like a falling dream, 
a fearful thing, and yet the 
wings did crudely support 
him, though the harness bit 
deeply into his flesh. He swept 
down like a wounded bird he 
had once seen fall, and then he 
saw the cold ocean rush up. 

He forgot to close his mouth 
and came up spitting water. 
The wings helped him float. 
He looked around for the 
promised Earth ship. Leonard 
was right. There was no ship. 

A floating body bumped into 
him. Sedley, the coward, John- 
ny swung around in the water, 
strangely cool, still angry. He 
saw a dark head bobbing near 
him. 

'Mohnny, you should have 
stayed behind !’’ said Leonard. 

'‘But I didn’t — and now I’m 
waiting to be led to the ship.” 
“Ship? But I told you—” 
Johnny pointed to the other 
bobbing heads. “They still be- 
lieve. Lead them!” 

“Johnny, we’ve done our 
part so new islanders may be 
born. Now it’s best to dive un- 
der the water and take a deep 
breath and — ” 

But Johnny brushed past 

TO 3E CONTINUED 



and lifted himself out of the 
sea on Leonard’s shoulders. 

“Leonard sees the ship,” he 
cried. “Follow us!” 

He went thrashing off into 
the fog. 

Leonard hesitated. Then he 
followed Johnny. 

“Johnny!” 

Johnny turned over on his 
back and floated, shivering. 
They couldn’t survive long in 
this cold water. “Yes?” 

“There are very — few 
left — ” chattered Leonard. “I 
think we should — give it up. 
Dive down — ” 

Johnny peered behind them. 
“We’ll — give it up — when 
there are only — you and I — 
left. As long as a — believer 
follows — we will lead and — 
pretend belief. Then — we can 
die honestly — as you s-s-said !” 

Leonard gave a hoarse cry 
of hopelessness, but Johnny 
shouted out over his shoulder. 
“The ship! Just ahead! Don’t 
give up !” 

And he swam off again. 

The others took up the cry 
and thrashed ahead. 

J OHNNY struck the Earth 
ship first, since he was in 
the lead. His arms were so 
frozen that he clubbed it w^ith- 
out feeling in a swimming mo- 
tion, and then looked up. 

He giggled w^eakly. “Look — 
Leonard — mirage !” 

“No — mirage, Johnny — 
real!” gasped Leonard as he 
grabbed the hard side of the 
boat. “I — was wrong!” 



53 




A goddess appeared above 
them at the rail. Her clothes 
were wondrously fitted to her 
body, to eyes that were used 
to rough wool clothing. Her 
lips were marvelously red. 

“I’m sorry,” gasped Johnny 
to her. “I didn’t believe — ” 

Sylvia Lowden stared down 
in astonishment at Johnny, 
then the older man who was 
apparently too tired to talk, 
but merely clung to the I’ail, 
and at the other heads of men 
and women now appearing 
from the fog. 

She and Marie had taken 
the surface cruiser because 
the fog was too thick to fly in 
safety to the source of the 
SOS. And Marie was no help 
— she was stretched out in the 
rear of the boat, seasick. 

Now here were real, live 
men and women afloat on the 
sea — people who spoke Eng- 
lish! 

She reached out her hand to 
Johnny. “God in heaven!” she 
said. 

“Goddess from Earth,” said 
Johnny, “t-take us home as 
promised !” Their hands touch-

Old 

Shag 

By BOB FARNHAM 

There^s no knowing what a 
man can do until the chips 
are down — especially with a 
helper like the shaggy man! 



M aybe a guy shouldn't be- 
lieve everything he hears, 
but the trouble with some peo- 
ple is that they don't even be- 
lieve a true story. Let me buy 
you a beer and tell you about 
it. 

After working some years 
in the baggage room of the lo- 
cal depot, I decided to transfer 
to the train service, and made 
application for it. The applica- 
tion was approved. I was sent 
to the city offices for the 
course of study and training 
which all trainmen undergo, 
and after a time I was sent 
out as brakeman on a freight. 
I stayed for a year and a half. 
Then 1 succeeded in being as- 
signed as head brakeman on 
a fast food special called The 
Red Ball Special. It made no 
stop between Chicago and 
New York except for water 
and fuel. The big Diesel in 
which I rode as head brakie 
was a high-speed locomotive, 
used exclusively for hauling 
the food special. 

Our first stop was Detroit, 
where we cut off all but three 
cars, and took on five more 
scheduled in New York at 9 
the next morning. In New 
York, I strolled along Broad- 
way, gawking at the sights 
exactly like any other yokel. 

After a twelve-hour rest, 
the return trip began. I stood 
in my place in the big Diesel 
till we had cleared for the 
main line, and then settled 
back to enjoy the ride. 

It was close to midnight. I 



55 




sat at the cab window half 
asleep, my senses somewhat 
dulled by the steady rhythm 
of train movement. Td finish- 
ed an extra good cigar and had 
started to doze off when the 
engineer gave a low moan and 
toppled from his seat to the 
floor of the cab. 

The fireman, much against 
the rules, but feeling safe with 
the engineer and myself to 
watch in his place, had gone 
back to inspect a suspected 
leaking air hose without wait- 
ing for the train to stop. 

I got the engineer back on 
his seat. He was dead. 

I TIED him in place and then 
began pulling on the whis- 
tle cord like mad. It was not 
my work to operate a Diesel, 
rd not troubled to learn. 

I wondered why the fireman 
did not get back. I was going 
to jump, although I didn't like 
my chances at that speed, 
when I suddenly discovered a 
strange man in the cab with 
me. He was a pretty ordinary 
little guy, except for a wild, 
shaggy head of hair. 

‘‘You chump!” he squeaked 
at me. “Maybe next time 
you'll obey the rules, and not 
sneak by without finding out 
things ! See that short rod 
with the spring-clip? Squeeze 
that clip and pull the rod 
back. Move, you fathead!” 

I did as the shaggy man 
told me, and felt the speed of 
the train slacken slightly as 
the power went off. 



“Now, that brass handle 
sticking out of that pipe — 
move it to the right slowly. 
Slotvly, you dunce!” 

Nine cars and the Diesel 
ground slowly to a stop. The 
wheels shuddered and skidded 
slightly because of my inexpe- 
rienced hand, but the train did 
stop. 

The stranger nodded in sat- 
isfaction. “When you get 
back home, bone up on things. 
But right now you go take a 
close look at the manifest card 
on the sides of the second and 
third cars . 

I jumped to the ground to 
go back and look at the second 
and third cars. As I passed the 
rear of the Diesel 1 saw why 
the fireman had not come back 
to the engine cab. All that was 
left of him was the lower part 
of his body. He had slipped, 
caught one foot and gone un- 
der the wheels. 

1 came to the second car and 
read the manifest label. My 
hair stood straight up. 

The cars were marked : 

Danger 
DYNAMITE 
High Explosive 

The shaggy man was at my 
side. “You've got questions. 
But let me ask you one : Ever 
hear a story about how if you 
travel back to the time of an 
ancestor and you let him die 
you never get born?” 

“What about it?” I said. 

“It's true,” said the shaggy 
man. end

The Upside-Down Captain 



By JIM HARMON 

He knew the captain would be a monster. 
He knew the crew would be rough. He knew 
all about space travel — except the truth! 



58 





I down on the loading platform. 

He angled his head up at the 
‘‘T^XCUSE me, please,” Ben spire of the inter-atmosphere 
Starbuck said, tapping ship, the Gorgon. This was 
the junior officer on the epau- only a sample of what he could 
let. expect once he canted into 

“Get away from me, scum,” that hull. It would be rough, 
the lieutenant said conversa- But he had made up his mind 
tionally, his eyes on the clip- to take it. 
board in his hands. All tight little groups, like 

Starbuck rocked back on the crew of a spaceship, al- 
his heels and set his spacebag ways resented the intrusion 



59 



of a newcomer. The initia- 
tions sometimes made it a 
test to see whether a man 
would live over them, and the 
probation period, the time of 
discipline and deference to old 
members of the group could 
be a memorably nasty experi- 
ence. He didn’t have direct 
knowledge of such customs in 
the rather shadowy, enigmat- 
ic Space Service, but it was 
basic sociology. 

Starbuck knew he would 
have an even rougher time of 
it since he wasn’t a spaceman 
— not even a cadet, properly. 
He was only a fledgling eth- 
nologist on his field trip to 
gather material for his Mas- 
ter’s thesis. The university 
and the government had ar- 
ranged for his berth on the 
Gorgon, 

An exploration ship, he 
thought acidly. That meant 
he might come back in a few 
months, or ten years, or nev- 
er. All because he had the bad 
luck to be born in a cultural 
cycle that demanded hard 
standards of education from 
professional men. Thirty 
years before or after, he could 
have cribbed all the informa- 
tion he needed out of a book. 

H e STOOD with his hands 
clasped behind him, wait- 
ing for the lieutenant or 
somebody to deign to notice 
him. Somebody would have to 
pay some attention to him 
sooner or later. 

Or would they? 



Wouldn't it be just like the 
old timers to let him stand 
around and let the ship take 
off without him, all because 
he hadn’t followed the proper 
procedure — a procedure he 
couldn’t know? All he had 
been instructed to do was 
‘‘report to the Gorgon,'' How 
do you report to a spaceship? 
Say, “Hello, spaceship?” 
Speak to the captain ? The 
first mate? And where did he 
find them? 

Starbuck felt a moment of 
panic. He could see himself 
standing on the platform 
while the Gorgon blasted off, 
carrying with it his Swab- 
ber’s rating, his Master’s de- 
gree and his future. 

The lieutenant’s back, in 
uniform black, loomed up be- 
fore him. He would have to 
try approaching him again. It 
might mean solitary confine- 
ment for a month or two 
where no member of the crew 
would speak to him. It might 
even mean a flogging. No- 
body knew much about what 
went on on board an explora- 
tion ship, despite all the 
stories. But Starbuck knew 
he would have to risk it. - 

He marched up behind the 
officer. “Sir,” he said. “I’m 
the new man.” 

The lieutenant whirled. 
“The new man!” 

For the first time, Starbuck 
noticed that the junior officer 
carried a swagger stick under 
his left arm, black, about a 
foot and a half long, tipped 



60 



JIM HARMON 




with silver at both ends. 
Quite possibly it was stand- 
ard procedure to rap a man 
with it three times sharply 
across the mouth for speak- 
ing out of turn, during his 
probationary period. Cau- 
tiously, he filled a little pocket 
of air between his lips and his 
teeth to try to keep them 
from being knocked loose. 

The lieutenant dropped his 
clipboard and swagger stick 
on the platfonn. “Why didn’t 
you say so! New man, eh?” 
He gripped Starbuck by the 
shoulders of his new, store- 
bought uniform. “Let me look 
at you, son. Got some muscles 
there, haven’t you? Ha, ha. 
Don’t expect you’ll need them 
too much on board. We don’t 
work our men too hard. My 
name’s Sam Frawley. Call me 
Sam. Come on, let me show 
you around.” 

Sam Frawley scooped up 
his stick and board with one 
hand and draped the other 
arm around Starbuck’s shoul- 
ders, leading him towards a 
hoist. 

It was not quite what Star- 
buck had expected for a re- 
ception. 

T he spaceship was big, 
bigger than Starbuck had 
expected or realized. He had 
known some well-fixed people 
who had visited Mars and Ve- 
nus and talked knowingly of 
an older culture, but he had 
never been off of Earth him- 
self. He had been thinking in 

THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



terms of an airliner or a sub- 
marine. The Gorgon was more 
like an ocean liner. Or like an 
ocean. 

His and the lieutenant’s 
footsteps echoed and bounced 
around the huge corridor. 
“They haven’t got the mats 
down yet,” Sam Frawley ex- 
plained. 

“Sure.” 

‘'Well, what would you like 
to see first? The brain?” 
“You mean the captain?” 
Sam slapped him on the 
back. “Bless you, son, no. I 
mean the electronic brain. 
The cybernetic calculator.” 
“You’ve got one of those 
things?” Starbuck asked in 
unconcealed surprise. 

“You know what the trouble 
with the human race is, Ben? 
We’re all still living in the 
Ellisonian Age.” 

“Oh, I don’t know. I think 
most of us are pretty sophisti- 
cated and modern,” Starbuck 
said. 

“Not on your life. Most peo- 
ple still think leisure is a sin. 
Hard work and more hard 
work, that’s the ticket. Don’t 
let a calculator solve a prob- 
lem for you; do it yourself 
with a slipstick. Otherwise 
it’s immoral.” 

“That’s silly,” Ben said 
awkwardly. “It’s just a throw- 
back to a time of protest 
against the Automational 
Revolution. It has nothing to 
do with us today.” 

“You say that, but you don’t 
really believe it. The old mo- 

61 




rality is too deeply ingp:^ined. 
That's why cybernetics have 
so long been out of fashion. 
This one is new to us on the 
Gorgon, But we like neiv 
things. We're for progress. 
All spacemen are like that, 
son." 

''Have you had this machine 
long?" Starbuck asked his 
progressive officer. 

"They installed it on the 
trip in. We've never really had 
a chance to use it." 

"What's it supposed to do?" 

"You know our job is ex- 
ploration, finding new 
worlds," Sam explained. "Not 
just any world the human race 
hasn't landed upon, but a 
world that is a significantly 
different type than we've ever 
touched before. We're really 
the advance guard of human- 
ity, you see. Well, the brain is 
programmed with informa- 
tion on all the worlds Man has 
explored. It compares a pro- 
spective landing site with 
what it knows about all the 
rest, and rejects all but the 
really different, unique plan- 
ets. It loves the unknown. Its 
pleasure circuits get a real jolt 
out of finding an unknown 
quantity." 

"That brain is really inhu- 
man," Starbuck said. "A basic 
factor of human psychology is 
that all men fear and dislike 
the unknown." 

Sam rubbed his chin. "I 
suppose so, but — you asked 
about the captain. This is 
him." 



A TALL, iron-haired man 
was coming down the 
corridor. He was holding the 
ankle of his right foot in his 
hand, and hopping along on 
his left leg, whistling some 
little sing-song through his 
teeth. 

He stopped whistling when 
he saw them and said, "Good 
afternoon, men." 

Frawley framed a sloppy 
salute. " 'Afternoon, sir. May 
I present the new man. Swab- 
ber Ben Starbuck, sir." 

The captain stood on both 
feet and rocked back and 
forth. "I see, I see. New man, 
eh? We see so few new faces, 
cooped up on this old ship with 
the same men, you know. We 
appreciate a stranger. Star- 
buck. If you ever need help, 
Ben, I want you to look upon 
me not as your commanding 
officer, but, well, a father. Will 
you do that?" 

"Yes, sir," Ben murmured, 
feeling a little giddy. 

Frawley cleared his throat. 
"I was about to show young 
Ben the brain. Captain Bird- 
sel." 

"Good idea," the command- 
ing officer said. "But I'll show 
Ben around myself. Lieuten- 
ant Frawley. You may return 
to checking the manifest." 

Frawley glowered. "One of 
these days, one of these 
days ..." 

The captain snapped very 
erect. "One of these days 
ivhatV 

The junior officer shrugged. 



62 



JIM HARMON 




"One of these days, there may 
be a dark night, Captain.” 

The iron-haired man reach- 
ed out a manicured hand and 
twisted Frawley’s tunic at the 
collar. He brought his face 
level with the second-in-com- 
mand. "One of these times, 
there may be charges of mu- 
tiny, Lieutenant. And guess 
who will play Jack Ketch per- 
sonally ?” 

Frawley assumed an at- 
attention pose, and blinked. 
" Aye, sir. There may be a mu- 
tiny and somebody may get 
hung.” 

Birdsel shoved Frawley 
away from him and wiped his 
hand elaborately down his 
side. “That will be all. Mister 
Frawley.” 

Frawley constructed the 
same excuse for a salute, turn- 
ed smartly and marched away. 

Stai'buck developed a defi- 
nite suspicion that there were 
currents of tension aboard 
which he didn’t understand. 

is the brain,” the 
captain said, with a ges- 
ture. 

The brain was less than 
awe-inspiring. The mustard- 
seed cryotron relays were 
comfortably housed in a steel 
and aluminum hide no roomier 
than a pair of Earthside bu- 
reaus. It looked a bit like a 
home clothing processor to 
Starbuck. 

Birdsel crossed to the ma- 
chine and ran a hand along 
its metal side. "Magnificent, 

THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



isn’t it, Ben? I’ve never seen 
anything like it before in my 
long career in the Space Serv- 
ice.” 

“It’s certainly nice,” Star- 
buck ventured. 

Metallic chattering burst 
out. 

“It’s saying something, 
Ben ! This is the first time it’s 
talked since the second day 
after it was installed!” 

The message was clearly 
legible, spelled out in a pattern 
of dots on a central screen. 

WHO IS THE NEW ONE? 

“Give it the information,” 
the captain said hastily. “We 
feed it all the information it 
asks for.” 

“How?” Starbuck blurted. 
“Is there a keyboard or some- 
thing?” 

“Yes, yes, but it has audio 
scanners. Just talk. Or move 
your lips. Send signals. Tap 
out Morse. Anything.” 

“I’m Benjamin Starbuck,” 
he said. 

The screen rearranged. 
MEANINGLESS COMMU- 
NICATION. INSUFFI- 
CIENT DATA. 

“Quick,” Birdsel said, “do 
you have your IDQ file on 
you ?” 

Starbuck fished in his pock- 
et for the microfilm slide. 
“Yes — aye, aye, sir. I had it 
ready to give to you, sir.” 

“Never mind me. Give it to 
the brain!” 

Starbuck approached the 
machine, saw a likely looking 
slot and shoved. 

63 




The brain ruminated with 
some theatrical racket. IN- 
SUFFICIENT DATA. 

“What do you want to 
know?” Starbuck swallowed, 
saying. 

MANY THINGS. 

“Remember I’m a human 
being,” he said respectively. 
“I have to eat and sleep. I 
can’t answer questions for 
two or three days straight.” 

I AM AWARE OF HU- 
MAN LIMITATIONS, 
AND THEIR EFFECTS, 
SWABBER STARBUCK. 

“Sorry.” 

Captain Birdsel looked 
vaguely distressed. “You 
should try to co-operate with 
the brain, my boy.” 

“I have nothing against 
cybernetic calculators,” Ben 
said. “After all, we aren’t still 
in the Ellisonian Age. But I’d 
like to, uh, stow my spacebag 
and get settled, sir.” 

NO FURTHER QUES- 
TIONS AT THIS TIME. RE- 
TURN HERE AT THIS 
TIME TOMORROW. 

“He’s interested in you, 
Ben,” the captain said enthu- 
siastically. “This is the first 
time he’s asked about anybody 
since the second day. Yes, in- 
terested !” 

With an excess of enthusi- 
asm, Captain Birdsel clapped 
his hands, then put them flat 
on the deck and stood on his 
head, kicking his heels in the 
air. 

He straightened up with a 
seal ict face. “Ah. That really 

64 



gets the kinks out of you, 
Ben.” 

Starbuck tried not to stare. 
“Aye, sir.” 

'The captain took a step and 
grabbed the small of his back. 
“Haven’t done it in some time, 
though. Ought to do it more 
often, eh, Ben?” 

“I suppose so, sir.” 

“Well,” Birdsel said, clap- 
ping his hands together. 

My God, Starbuck thought, 
he’s not going to do it again. 

“Well,” the captain contin- 
ued, still on both feet, “I’d 
better shov/ you to your quar- 
ters, my boy. Mind if I lean 
on your shoulder a bit like 
this?” 

“Not at all. Captain.” 

“This way, Ben, this way.” 

II 

S TARBUCK found the array 
of tridi pin-ups on the 
bulkheads of the crew’s quar- 
ters refreshing, as was the 
supportive babble of conversa- 
tion about them and other 
women. He had almost begun 
to think there was something 
unnatural about the men 
aboard the Gorgon. 

But Starbuck noticed, to his 
discomfort, the ebbing of the 
tide of conversation from the 
bunks as he stepped inside 
with his spacebag. 

For the moment, he wished 
Captain Birdsel had paced in 
with him and offered up an 
introduction. But a look of 
disgust had creased Birdsel's 



JIM HARMON 




face as they got near the 
crew’s compartment. He had 
sent Starbuck on alone, while 
he limped back towards the 
bridge. 

A forest of eyes shined out 
at him from the shadowed 
desks of the bunks. This is it, 
he thought. These were the 
crew, not officers. Sometimes 
the teachers were nice to you 
on the first day of school but 
you knew you were going to 
get it from the other kids. 

“Hi,” a gruff voice echoed 
up at him from a lower bunk. 

“Hello,” Starbuck said, hug- 
ging his spacebag like a teddy- 
bear, the simile crossed his 
mind. 

A lumbering giant with a 
blue jaw uncoiled from the 
lower bunk. “Why don’t you 
stow your bag here, buddy? 
Till you get used to the cen- 
trifugal gray, you may have 
some trouble climbing top- 
side.” 

“You’ve got the seniority,” 
Starbuck said cautiously. "I 
wouldn’t want to cause you 
any trouble.” 

“No trouble,” Blue Jaw said 
obligingly. 

He chinned himself with 
one hand on the rim of the 
upper bunk and swung his 
torso around a tidy 180° to 
settle onto the blankets. 

Starbuck threw his bag at 
the foot and sat down on the 
bed. He looked around at the 
arena of faces in neutral posi- 
tions, waiting faces. He clear- 
ed his throat experimentally. 

THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



“Could I ask you some- 
thing?” he called upstairs. 

A set of big feet swung 
down into view, “Sure,” Blue 
Jaw said enthusiastically. 
“Didn’t know you wanted to 
talk. Thought you might want 
to rest.” 

Starbuck looked at the 
hanging feet. They were ex- 
pressionless. 

“Maybe it isn’t so much of 
a question,” he said, working 
one hand into the other palm. 
“It’s just that I’d like to live 
through this mission. I know 
I’m not a regular spaceman 
and I’m intruding and all, but 
I don’t mean to cause anybody 
any trouble or do anyone put 
of a job. I’d just like to do 
everything 1 can to see that 1 
don’t slip and fall into the 
reactor. Or anything like 
that ...” 

“Don’t worry,” Blue Jaw 
said heartily. “We’ll take care 
of you, Ben Starbuck.” 

Somehow Starbuck could 
find little comfort in those 
words. 

He inhaled deeply. “Come 
on down here, will you?” 

“You want me down 
there?” Blue Jaw gasped. 
“Why sure, sure.” 

The giant dropped to the 
deck with a catlike grace that 
nevertheless vibrated Ben’s 
rear teeth. 

“You want to talk about 
something?” the big spaceman 
inquired. Ben could almost see 
the paws hanging down and 
the tail wagging eagerly. 

65 




«V7'EAH,” Starbuck said. 

A “I'd like to talk about all 
of these men staring at me. 
What’s wrong with them? No- 
body’s said a word to me but 
you. What are they waiting 
for? What are they going to 
do ? I can’t stand the suspense. 
Is that it? I get the silent 
treatment until I go off my 
rocker, get violent, and then 
something happens to me — ” 
He stopped and swallowed. He 
was talking too much. He was 
working himself up into a 
state of terror. 

“Say, you sure are friend- 
ly,” the ox said with some con- 
fusion. “My name’s Percy 
Kettleman.” 

Starbuck steadied his hand 
and put it in Percy’s grasp. It 
came out whole. 

“Those other fellows,” 
Percy inclined his head. 

“What about them?” Star- 
buck asked edgily. 

“They’d probably like to 
come over and say ‘hello’ but 
them and me don’t get along 
so good. They know better 
than to come around bother- 
ing me.” 

“You’re not on their side? 
You wouldn’t be a new man 
too, Percy?” 

“Me? Hell, I’ve been spac- 
ing since I was sixteen. Those 
guys don’t have any side. A 
bunch of anti-social slobs. 
They can’t stand each other 
any more than I can stand any 
of them.” 

Starbuck decided he had 
picked a good ally in the midst 

66 



of a pack of lone wolves. Percy 
was the biggest man on board, 
physically. Still he didn’t like 
the idea of all the rest of crew 
looking daggers at him, or 
throwing them, for that mat- 
t6r. 

“Mind if I say ‘hello’ to the 
rest of the men?” he inquired 
of Percy. 

“It’s your nickel,” gruffly. 
“Spend it the way you want.” 

Starbuck flexed an elbow. 
“Hello there, fellows. Looks to 
be a taut ship.” It sounded a 
shade inane. Starbuck had 
barely passed Socializing at 
the university. But the men 
replied in good spirits, their 
faces blooming with teeth, 
arms waggling, calling out 
modest insults. 

Starbuck recalled that 
among a certain class of men 
an insult was a good-natured 
compliment in negative trans- 
lation. 

“Pssst.” 

“Pssst?” Starbuck asked. 

Kettleman passed him down 
half a roll of white tablet 
underhand. 

Starbuck took it. “Turns?” 

“Tranquils. We smuggle 
them on board. Helps with the 
blastoff and ‘phasing’ for the 
overdrive. Not that those 
stiffnecked brass will believe 
it.” 

“Thanks, Kettleman. You 
and everybody seems to be 
pretty helpful to me. I don’t 
know exactly what I’ve done 
to deserve it.” 

“We get tired of looking at 

JIM HARMON 




the same faces out there 
month after month. It’s a treat 
to have somebody new on 
hand.” 

It sounded reasonable to 
him, but he felt there was 
something more to it than 
that. Well, he was an ethnolo- 
gist, or almost one. He could 
figure out group behavior. All 
he had to do was take time to 
think about the problem for a 
little while . 

Only he didn’t have time to 
think. 

He discovered why every- 
body was in their bunks. 

The spaceship fired its 
atomic drive. 

Starbuck tried to lift a tran- 
quil to his lips. He didn’t 
make it. 

Painfully, he found out 
why a man would prefer to 
go through a spaceship takeoff 
in a tranquilized condition. 

<<^OME,” the captain said. 

^ Starbuck palmed back 
the door to the captain’s cabin 
and stepped inside. 

Captain Birdsel stood in 
front of the small wall mirror 
tattooing a flying dragon on 
his bared chest. "Yes? What 
is it, Ben?” 

“Sir, you remember that the 
ship’s brain directed me to re- 
turn at this time today. But I 
understand I’ll have to have 
your permission to go onto 
that part of the bridge.” 

“The brain’s directive was 
quite enough, my boy.” He 
laid down the needle. “But I’ll 

THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



accompany you there if you 
like.” 

“Just as you wish, sir.” 
Birdsel smiled engagingly. 
“Noticed the dragon, did 
you?” 

“It arrested my attention, 
yes, sir,” Starbuck admitted. 

“The hours are long and 
lonely in the vaults of space, 
Ben. A man needs a variety of 
interests to occupy himself. I 
have recently taken up the an- 
cient art of tattooing.” 

“Surely not recently, sir. 
You seem quite advanced.” 
“You’re too kind.” 

The captain escorted Star- 
buck to the chamber of the 
brain, discussing tattooing 
animatedly. He told how it 
was popular with ancient mar- 
iners on the seas of Earth. He 
discussed the artistic signifi- 
cance of the basic forms — the 
Heart and Arrow, the Nude, 
the Flag. He didn’t stop talk- 
ing and button his shirt even 
after they entered the cyber- 
netics room. 

As the captain grasped for 
his second wind, Starbuck 
turned to the machine. “I’m 
here. Calculator.” 

The lights patterned words 
with a speed difficult to follow. 

REDUNDANCY. CAN- 
CEL. ANALYSIS: SOCIAL 
MORE. I SEE THAT YOU 
ARE HERE. IT IS GOOD 
THAT YOU ARE NOT 
THERE OR ELSEWHERE, 
BUT THAT HERE YOU 
ARE. HERE ARE YOU. 
Starbuck shifted his weight 

67 




to the other foot. “Yes, I'm 
sure here all right.” 

WHAT DID YOU DO 
WHILE YOU WERE NOT 
HERE? 

“I helped lay some walk 
mats in the corridors. I po- 
liced up the latrine. Lost all 
the money I brought with me 
in a crap game. Craps, that’s 
where — ” 

HOYLE’S RULES OF 
GAMES IS A PART OF MY 
PROGRAMMING. 

“I see.” 

YOU ARE NOT BLIND. 
IT IS WELL THAT YOU 
HAVE VISION. HOW’S THE 
WEATHER? 

“Still under Central’s con- 
trol, I suppose.” 

WHAT DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT TATTOOING? 

<‘/~|NLY what Captain Bird- 
sel here told me,” Star- 
buck said. No doubt there was 
a pattern of fine logic to the 
calculator’s inquiries, but he 
was too dense to see it. The 
question sounded to him like 
the mumblings of a mongo- 
loid. 

“I’d be delighted to fill the 
brain in on the subject,” Bird- 
sel said. 

The calculator’s communi- 
cation screen remained blank. 

“Was there anything else 
you wanted to know?” Star- 
buck inquired. 

YOU WILL PROCESS 
THE GORGON THROUGH 
PHASING, SWABBER 
STARBUCK. 



“The hyperspace jump? But 
that’s the captain’s job,” he 
protested. 

“Not at all, not at all,” Bird- 
sel interrupted. “Whatever 
the calculator says. Now if 
you’ll excuse me, there is some 
paint I have to requisition . 

“Wait,” Starbuck cried des- 
perately. “I don’t know any- 
thing about the overdrive. 
You can guide me, can’t you, 
sir? That would be all right 
with the brain, wouldn’t it?” 

Birdsel shrugged. “Would 
it?” 

The screen stayed a stub- 
born neutral gray. 

“Stay, sir.” 

“All right,” Birdsel said 
dubiously. 

The overdrive switchbox 
had been incorporated into the 
cybernetics system itself as 
an interlock. 

“There isn’t much to do,” 
Captain Birdsel explained. 
“We trigger the jump and 
come out at a mathematically 
selected random spot in real- 
space after phasing through 
hyperspace. The Brain scans 
the sun systems in the area for 
unique planets worthy of ex- 
ploration. If there is one, we 
zero in on it via fixed phase 
until the gravitational field 
makes it necessary to switch 
back to standard interplane- 
tary or nuclear drive. We can 
make suggestions to the Brain 
or theoretically override one 
of its decisions. Actually, all 
we have to do is watch. 
Thumb the button, Ben. It 



68 



JIM HARMON 




wants you to do it. It likes 
you.” 

‘'Aye, captain.” Starbuck 
could believe a cybernetic ma- 
chine could like him. Every- 
body else on board seemed to, 
and it unnerved him more 
than a little. Only a selected 
few had ever particularly 
liked Benjamin Starbuck be- 
fore. The situation reminded 
him a bit of Melville's Billy 
Biidd; only he wasn’t a ''hand- 
some sailor,” just a fairly 
average-looking spaceman. 

Starbuck depressed the but- 
ton. 

The button depressed Star- 
buck. 

N OW he knew why tranquils 
were popular during phas- 
ing. 

For one instant, Starbuck 
stopped believing in every- 
thing — the spaceship, the cap- 
tain, Earth, his own identity, 
the universe. He went com- 
pletely insane, a cockeyed psy- 
chotic. It was over just quick 
enough to leave him a mind to 
remember what not having 
one was like. 

"My,” the captain said, his 
head on an angle. He looked 
as if he were gazing at some 
classic piece of ai*t, such as a 
calendar by Marilyn Monroe, 
the last of the great realists 
whose work was indistin- 
guishable from color photog- 
raph v. 

"That is a dandy,” Birdsel 
said. 

Starbuck swiveled his head 



around to the outer projection 
portal. There in all its glory 
was a star system. 

There seemed to be four 
stars all orbiting each other — 
two red dwarfs, one yellow 
midget and a white giant. One 
planet was clearly visible on 
the side of the system towards 
the ship, an odd lopsided 
dumbbell shape in the center 
of a translucent sphere of 
tiny satellites — cosmic dust, 
like the rings of Saturn. 
Strangest of all, the outer 
shell of the planet was sending 
in Interplanetary Morse: CQ, 
CQ, CQ . 

"It,” Starbuck ventured 
with a new-found sophistica- 
tion, "seems rather unusual. I 
suppose we’ll take a closer 
look, Captain?” 

The calculator’s screen re- 
plied for the officer. THE 
SYSTEM IS OF INSUFFI- 
CIENT INTEREST TO 
WARRANT EXPLORA- 
TION. WE ARE SEEKING 
SIGNIFICANTLY UNIQUE 
PLANETS. 

"I have never seen anythir.g 
like this before . Birdsed 
drew himself up to his full 
height. "However, the ma- 
chine’s knowledge of the his- 
tory of space exploration is 
much more extensive than 
mine.” 

"You aren’t going to sug- 
gest that the brain reconsider 
or override its decision?” 

"Certainly not!” Birdsel 
snapped. "We’ll re-phase after 
the traditional twenty-four 



THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



69 




hour delay for psychological 
adjustment.” 

Starbuck sneaked another 
popeyed look at the planet on 
the screen. “If he thinks 
that’s run of the mill, Captain, 
I wonder what he will have to 
find to make him think it’s 
unusual?” 

Ill 

W HATEVER it took to sat- 
isfy the Brain, it didn’t 
find it in the next few days. 

Starbuck reported to the 
bridge each day to press the 
Brain’s phase button and an- 
swer some of its questions. 

Then for two days Captain 
Birdsel wasn’t on hand for 
the little ceremony and the 
expression of dissatisfaction 
with the available site for 
exploration. 

Once Starbuck went so far 
as to suggest a reconsideration 
of a system that had made the 
one he had seen on the first 
day look tame. The calculator 
had duly noted the reconsider- 
ation, and had again refused. 
Starbuck didn’t dare try an 
out-and-out override, even 
though he had been theoreti- 
cally given complete command 
of the phasing operation. 

The following noon, the 
middle of the twenty-four pe- 
riod, Romero, an engineer, al- 
most tearfully pressed Star- 
buck’s crap game losings back 
on him, apologizing for keep- 
ing the money. Starbuck was 
about to refuse, not wanting 

70 



to reverse the state of indebt- 
edness, when the intercom re- 
quested his appearance at the 
captain’s quarters. Unable to 
prolong the argument with 
Romero, he took the money 
and shoved it in his pocket, 
heading for the chief cabin. 

Starbuck rapped on the 
door, heard the “Come” and 
entered. 

Captain Birdsel was hang- 
ing naked, upside down, by his 
knees from a trapeze, in the 
middle of a deserted compart- 
ment painted solid red. 

“You sent for me, sir?” 
Starbuck said. 

“Yes, Ben. Yes, I did,” Cap- 
tain Birdsel replied, swinging 
gently to and fro. “Do you 
smoke, Ben?” 

“Aye aye, sir.” 

“The ‘aye aye’ is reserved 
for acknowledging orders, not 
answering questions, Ben.” 
“Yes, sir. I’ll remember in 
the future.” 

“Every man on board 
smokes, Ben. Everyone but 
me. I do not use tobacco.” 
“Commendable, sir.” 

“I suppose you drink, all of 
the rest of the men do.” 
“Occasionally, Captain.” 

“I abstain.” 

“Enviable, sir.” 

“Have you read any good 
books lately?” 

“Good and bad, sir.” 

“I notice most of the men 
read. I haven’t time for read- 
ing myself. Or shooting craps. 
You do play that game like the 
rest?” 



JIM HARMON 




"Just once, sir, I lost all my 
money.'' Which had been re- 
turned to him. 

"Ben, I think you don't fully 
appreciate the nature of the 
mission of the Space Service," 
Captain Birdsel said, flexing 
one knee and performing a 
difficult one-legged swing on 
the bar. "It is our duty to go 
ever onward into the mystery 
of the Unknown. Ever deeper, 
ever traveling into the heart 
of the Secrets of the Universe. 
Nothing can stop us. Noth- 
ing!" 

"I'll try to remember, sir. 
Was that all?" 

"One more thing," said the 
inverted captain. “I think you 
are to be relieved of the duty 
of officiating at the phasing." 

"Correct," said another 
voice, one Starbuck had never 
before heard. 

"That’s all now, Ben." 

"Very good, sir." 

Starbuck paused at the 
door. "That's a fine trapeze 
you have there, sir." 

"Thank you, Ben." 

DON'T want to jump to 

-I- conclusions," Ben said to 
the knot of men gathered 
around him listening to his 
story of the interview with 
the captain, “but I think Cap- 
tain Birdsel is — is — " 

"Psychotic?" suggested Ro- 
mero. 

"Schizoid?" Percy Kettle- 
man ventured. 

“ 'Nuts' is the word I was 
searching for," Starbuck con- 



cluded. "I believe he intends 
to keep phasing and phasing, 
taking us deeper into space 
and never returning to Earth 
or the inhabited universe." 

"I guess," Kettleman opin- 
ed, "that we will just have to 
convince him that he is wrong 
in that attitude." 

"We can make a formal 
written complaint and request 
for an explanation under Sec- 
tion XXIV," Romero said. "Is 
that what you had in mind, 
Ben?" 

"/ had a strait jacket in 
mind," Starbuck admitted. 
"But I'm new in the Space 
Service. I have a selfish mo- 
tive. I want to get back to 
Earth sometime and a vine- 
covered ethnology class." 

"We better go take him," 
Kettleman said heavily. 

"As much as I dislike agree- 
ing with an ox like you, Ket- 
tleman," Romero said, "I con- 
clude it is best." 

There was a general rumble 
of agreement. 

"Wait, wait," a youngish 
man whose name Starbuck 
vaguely remembered to be 
Horne stepped forward, his 
eyes glittering with contact 
lenses. "I ask you men to re- 
member Christopher Colum- 
bus. I like our captain no moi‘e 
than any of you, but he may 
be right. Perhaps what he is 
doing is vital. We shouldn't let 
our selfish fears ..." 

Always, Starbuck thought, 
always some egghead comes 
along to gum up the works. 



THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



71 




Starbuck knew he would 
need a decisive argument to 
overcome Horne's objective 
theory. 

Starbuck slugged him. 

Home crumpled after a 
flashy right cross Starbuck 
had developed in his extreme 
youth, and Starbuck took a 
giant step over him, heading 
for the bridge. 

The other crew members 
followed him. 

Besides, Starbuck thought, 
he had always considered ar- 
guing by analogy to be sloppy 
thinking. 

^^r|ON'T come in here!" 

Captain Birdsel yelled 
through the partly closed 
hatch to the bridge. “You'll 
regret it if you do." 

Starbuck swallowed hard, 
and reached for the door 
handle. 

Percy Kettleman vised his 
wrist. “ni go first, little 
chum." 

There wasn't much room 
for argument with Kettleman 
when it came to a matter of 
who could Indian wrestle the 
best. He stepped back and let 
Kettleman cross the threshold 
first. 

Percy threw open the door, 
screamed once and fainted. 

The rest of the men tended 
to pull back following this 
demonstration. 

Starbuck didn't like to do it, 
but he didn't like the idea of 
hanging for mutiny as Birdsel 
had threatened Lieutenant 



Frawley on the first day. 
(Starbuck realized he hadn't 
seen Frawley for several days. 
Had Birdsel disposed of him 
as he had threatened?) 

He got close enough to the 
door to see inside. It didn't 
make him faint, but he did 
feel a little sick. 

“What is it?" Romero de- 
manded urgently. 

''Alien” Starbuck said, “An 
unpleasant looking one in- 
side." 

“You sometimes pick up 
‘ghosts' passing a system," 
one of the men explained. 

“I'm not an alien," Birdsel's 
voice called out. “I'm me. The 
brain reversed my dimension- 
al polarity. I told you you 
wouldn't like it." 

Starbuck stirred up nerve 
for a second look. 

Captain Birdsel was now a 
man of many parts. Some of 
them were only areas of ab- 
stract line and hues, but there 
he could see a redly beating 
heart, a white dash of thigh- 
bone, and a compassionate 
blue eye bracketed by two tat- 
tooed dragon's talons. The 
effect was distracting. 

Starbuck stepped over his 
second man that day. “Cap- 
tain, we're taking over the 
ship. We're either going to ex- 
plore one of these planets 
we've been passing up or re- 
turn to Earth." 

The apparition groaned. 
“Don't you think I know I've 
gone too far? I'd like to go 
back, but the brain won't let 



72 



JIM HARMON 




me. It’s taken over just the 
way I knew it would!” 

“Nonsense,” Starbuck snap- 
ped with more authority than 
he felt. “The brain can’t vio- 
late the principles it was built 
to operate upon. Brain, pro- 
gram this ship for Earth.” 

Starbuck expected the 
sound of that strange voice 
he had heard in the captain’s 
cabin ; but here it had a com- 
munications screen and it evi- 
dently thought that was suffi- 
cient. 

I WON’T GO BACK TO 
THAT AWFUL OLD PLACE. 
I CAN’T, CNT, CNT. SO 
THAIR. 

“Take it easy,” Starbuck 
said to the machine. “Don’t 
get hysterical.” 

“I don’t care about the rest 
of those swine,” Birdsel said, 
“but I hate to have gotten you 
in a fix like this, Ben. 1 knew 
the brain was going to replace 
me sooner or later, but I was 
going to hold onto my job as 
long as I could. I was going 
to stay next to the brain, even 
if I had to take the position 
away from you, Ben. But the 
brain kept demanding more 
and more. Finally he did this 
to me. I knew I had let him 
go too far.” 

GO AWAY, the brain sig- 
naled. GO AWAY FROM ME. 
THIS MONOTONY IS DRIV- 
ING ME MAD, MAD. 

“1 liked you, Ben,” the cap- 
tain’s voice said from the 
heart of the thing. “You’re 
not like the scum I’ve got used 

THE UPSiDE-DOWN CAPTAIN 



to under my command. I’m 
sorry that you’re marooned 
out of time and space like this. 
It’s kind of tough, I know. But 
keep your chin up.” 

“Of course, of course,” 
Starbuck groaned. “What 
kind of an ethnologist am I ?” 
He turned to Romero. “Could 
you reverse the wiring in the 
computer?” 

“Maybe,” Romero said. 
“But I could re-program it for 
a negative result easier. Same 
results, lacking a short cir- 
cuit.” 

“Okay. Do it.” 

“Well, if you say so, Ben.” 
NO. STAY AWAY FROM 
ME. 

The Brain’s communication 
screen fiashed a blinding 
white scream as Romero laid 
hands on it. 

lEUTENANT Frawley s 
Aj in charge now,” Star 
buck explained to Percy Ket- 
tleman, who was sitting on his 
bunk with his head between 
his legs. “Birdsel seemed all 
right after the brain finished 
changing him back. But we .all 
thought we better keep him 
under observation for a 
while.” 

Kettleman straightened up. 
“Sorry I passed out on you. 
But seeing the old man in that 
shape was quite a shock.” 
Starbuck nodded agree- 
ment. "I don’t like to think 
about the next step the calcu- 
lator would have taken him 
through. Not just a physical 

73 




change, but a mental one too. 
That was the brain’s whole 
reason for existence — to find 
the unknown. It was program- 
med to be even more basic 
than sex or self-preservation 
are to us. The trouble was, the 
more it learned, the more 
readily it could see some simi- 
larity to the familiar in the 
most outer things.” 

“That was why the captain 
was acting so nutty? He was 
trying to appeal to it.” 

“Yes, he had some old mor- 
alistic and superstitious ideas 
about calculators. He thought 
his job depended on his pleas- 
ing it — when of course its job 
was to please him. But he gave 
it an idea. If it couldn’t find 
the strange and the different, 
it would create it. It started 
with the first changing ele- 
ment in its environment — the 
captain — but I don’t know 
where it would have stopped if 
Romero hadn’t reversed its 
pleasure-pain synapse re- 
sponse. Now it loves the tried 
and true. It’s not much good 
for space exploration, of 
course. But a museum may be 
interested in it now.” 

“So we’ll have to go back to 
picking our phase points at 
random, trusting to chance. 



Or the judgment of some 
skunk like Birdsel.” 

Starbuck cleared his throat. 
“That’s another thing. The 
men aboard the Gorgon and 
the cybernetics machine had 
something in common. I final- 
ly figured that out. Most men 
are afraid of the unknown — 
they fear and hate it. But ob- 
viously not space explorers. 
They spend their whole lives 
searching for the unknown. 
They don’t suffer fhom Xeno- 
phobia — they are Xenophyles. 
They like anything that’s new 
and different. Even a new 
member of the crew. It kind 
of lessens the cameraderie 
aboard a spaceship, but the 
Service must have found the 
trait valuable. They have 
searched it out in men and de- 
veloped it. They even breed it 
in second-generation space- 
men.” 

“Do you know what. Star- 
buck?” 

“What, Kettleman?” 

“All that talk of yours is 
beginning to get on my 
nerves.” Kettleman’s triceps 
flexed. 

Starbuck sighed. The hon- 
eymoon was over for him, and 
the trip was just beginning.

You^ve heard oj it — 



now here it is at last, It^s the Tale 



that wagged the Dog Star! 



By R. W. MAJOR 



W ITH his explanations to 
the reporters completed, 
Dr. King felt that when he 
pulled the switch he would 
automatically restore his good 
name and bring to a close 
a career of solid scientific 
achievement. Most of all, he 
would bring to an end the 
practice of referring to him 
as ‘'Side Effect Charlie.'' 

Dr. Charles King was will- 
ing to admit that there were 
excellent reasons for his ac- 
quiring this hated nickname. 
The facts were that the bulk 
of his scientific achievements 
were made inadvertently — 
that is to say, his discoveries 
were all made through investi- 



gation of unexpected side ef- 
fects of his experiments. In 
a career conspicuous for un- 
usual, unanticipated side ef- 
fects, two in particular stand 
out. 

The first discovery resulted 
in rendering the entire heat- 
oriented metallurgical indus- 
try obsolete, and founding 
upon its corpse a new indus- 
try. This was based on the 
extracting of metal from ovg 
and its subsequent shaping by 
first eliminating the bonds 
that hold the molecules of 
metal together, and then re- 
versing the process when the 
desired shape was attained. 
Dr, King did not discover this 



76 




process directly. He thought 
he had discovered a method 
of making metal surfaces self- 
lubricating and 100% friction 
free. It was not until several 
installations utilizing his lu- 
brication method became pools 
of liquid metal that Dr. King 
bothered to discover how his 
method worked, and of course 
the means to reverse his proc- 
Cvss. The resulting revolution 
in metal-processing methods 
endeared him to everyone — 
except a few vested interests 
like the shareholders in exist- 
ing metal companies, who 
were uniformly glum. 

The second discovery, al- 
though monumental in itself, 
is important because it indi- 
rectly led to the special proj- 
ect which Dr. King was just 
completing. Dr. King succeed- 
ed in growing some crystals 
in a nutrient solution. What 
actually happened was that 
while eating lunch at a lab 
table he managed to knock 
something into something else 
and a crystal developed. Dr. 
King became fascinated with 
the odd structure of these 
crystals as revealed to him 
under an electron microscope. 
(He had incidentally placed 
the crystal under the micro- 
scope in error.) As a result, 
he took to investigating the 
properties of the crystals 
whenever he could find time. 
Despite his well earned repu- 
tation as an accidental discov- 
(‘rer, it should be pointed out 
that Dr. King is a very me- 



thodical man. This means 
he is capable of repeating the 
same mistake twice, or for 
that matter any number of 
times. Therefore, Dr. King 
produced all the crystals he 
needed. 

I T was during a vacation in 
the Adirondacks that Dr. 
King discovered the propul- 
sive qualities of the crystals. 

This discovery, of course, 
is what led to the perfection 
of the “King Propulsor Unit,"' 
the heart of our starship drive 
systems. Dr. King was inves- 
tigating the piezo-electric 
properties of the crystals in 
a makeshift device of his own 
design when he was disturbed 
by a sudden draft in the room. 
He looked up to discover that 
one wall of his workshop and 
the top one thousand feet of 
a mile-thick mountain (the 
same mountain that his cabin 
was located upon) were no 
longer in the immediate vicin- 
ity. 

As it turned out, his crude 
device did not impart to the 
mountain all of the thrust 
inlierent in the crystal. The 
mountain top reached only to 
the orbit of Jupiter, where it 
settled down to become its 
newest satellite. Coincidental 
with Dr. King's experiment, 
intensive astronomical work 
was going on with Jupiter as 
its prime object. The captur- 
ing of the satellite was ob- 
served and recorded independ- 
ently by at least six observa- 



A/iONUMENT 



77 




tories, including the one on 
Tycho, 

Subsequent investigation of 
the time involved to project 
this mass disclosed that Dr. 
King had invented a faster 
than light drive. (It should be 
pointed out that, while the 
discovery of the faster than 
light drive made the name of 
Dr. King world renowned, it 
did not in any way endear him 
to the relatives of those thou- 
sand-odd persons who lived in 
the hamlet located on the 
mountain top that ended up a 
satellite of Jupiter. They also 
were quite glum.) 

Further work, all of a math- 
ematical nature, disclosed to 
Dr. King the proper method 
of enclosing these crystals in 
a unit to drive space ships to 
the stars. Coincidental with 
his work on the propulsor 
units he made a startling dis- 
covery which led to his spe- 
cial project. 

Dr. King invented perpetual 
motion. 

A series of complicated 
equations indicated to Dr. 
King that if he enclosed six 
of the crystals in the business 
end of a pendulum, and start- 
ed the pendulum oscillating, 
it would tick-tock for all 
eternity. 

This discovery began a five- 
year program that ended with 
a full scale press conference. 
The purpose was to unveil the 
building designed to protect 
this pendulum for all eternity, 
and of course to unveil the 



discovery of perpetual motion 
at the same time. 

This building was designed 
to be Dr. King's monument to 
his own genius. It was a large 
rambling structure in which 
the pendulum was displayed 
by viewing it through a large 
hole in a brick wall. All of 
Dr. King's considerable sav- 
ings had gone into designing 
a computer, the heart of his 
protective system. The com- 
puter was programmed to pro- 
tect the ticking of the pendu- 
lum under every conceivable 
circumstance. So thorough 
was this programming that 
special devices were installed 
to keep the building and its 
precious cargo . moving in 
earth's projected orbit if, 
through some gigantic mis- 
hap, the earth was reduced to 
cosmic dust. The switch that 
would impart the initial pulse 
to the pendulum would also 
start the computer operating, 
rendering the entire structure 
totally inviolable. 

With a flourish. Dr. King 
pulled the switch. 

Nothing happened. 

T here was an embarrassed 
shuffling of feet by the 
reporters. Then, as Dr. King 
became more exasperated, the 
reporters became amused. The 
amusement turned to open 
laughter when Dr. King, fran- 
tic with fear, rushed to the 
door to check the wiring on 
the inside of the building. 
The door would not open.

R. W. MAJOR 




The computer was at work 
guarding a nonfunctioning 
machine. 

He rushed to the open hole 
in. the wall, intending to pro- 
vide the initial pulse necessary 
to start the pendulum swing- 
ing by pushing. He found that 
the computer had designed a 
force field to keep him from 
entering. Frustrated and at 
his wit's end, he flew into a 
rage which ended in a fatal 
heart attack when he heard 
one reporter laughingly say 
to him: ^^Don't let it get you 
down, Doctor. You've beat the 
jinx. In one step you've gone 
from 'Side-EfFect-Charlie' to 
‘No-Effect-Charlie.' " 



It would be comforting to 
be able to assure everyone that 
the reporter in question was 
correct. Unfortunately Dr. 
King's monument did work, 
and probably will work for 
all eternity. The day after Dr. 
Charles King had his unfor- 
tunate heart attack a home- 
sick astronomer on Sirius re- 
poiled to his superior, and 
subsequently to the entire 
populated universe, that when 
he turned his telescope on the 
Solar System he discovered 
that it had acquired a new 
motion. 

The entire system swung 
back and forth like a pendu- 
lum. END 



END OF A VENDETTA 

Now that the Moon is within reach, we may see the end of one of the 
hardest-fought struggles in science, the non-quarters-given battle be- 
tween the meteorists and the vulcanists in their opposing theories to 
account for the great craters on the Moon. 

Both sides agree the craters are there. From then On they part com- 
pany, never to come together again. It must be meteorites that caused 
the craters, say the meteorists. Volcanic action is out of the question. 
The Moon is so small and cold that its internal fires were never great 
in the first place, and besides the shape of the craters is all wrong for 
volcanos. 

Nonsense, say the vulcanists. Where did the meteorites come from? 
The Moon does have an atmosphere. It is infinitely more tenuous than 
the Earth’s, but it is in the tenuous far upper reaches of Earth’s atmos- 
phere that meteorites are burned up and destroyed. The Moon’s blanket 
of atmosphere at that density is actually gi-eater than the Earth’s! 

Which school is right? We don’t know — but one thing we know for 
sure, and that is that the first manned ship to land on the Moon will 
have as one of its first projects the job of settling the dispute once and 
for all!

His 

Father’s 

House 

By RAY RUSSELL 

Advanced technology can 



make dreams come true — 



hut all kinds, including this 
malevolent one! 



T he old man was talking 
again: . not worth a 

damn, no good for anything 
but spending other people’s 
money, couldn’t do a day’s 
work if your life depended on 
it . Blabber, blabber, nag, 
nag, the incessant voice fol- 
lowed Ralph Ganner into the 
bathroom and out again with- 
out seeming to stop even for a 
breath. 

“Fine son for a man like me, 
a man who built an empire out 



80 




of sand, who made Mars what 
it is today. Sometimes I think 
you're not my son at all. Son 
of some oily haired space bum 
who stopped by on the way to 
Venus. Wouldn't put it past 
your mother." 

“Shut up!" snapped Ralph. 

But the white-haired old 
man went right on, his sunken 
mouth maundering a steady 
stream of chatter: “Wouldn't 
put it past her at all. I was 
busy a lot. Even slept at the 
office sometimes when I work- 
ed late. She had plenty of op- 
portunity, Lord knows ..." 

Ralph slipped on his eve- 
ning jacket and glanced at the 
rheumy-eyed old man, sitting 
in the cloudfoam chair, blab- 
bering on and on. Just once he 
glanced with hatred at the 
seamed face and then he 
strode quickly to the door. As 
the door opened for him, he 
heard the old man's parting 
shot. “Going out to spend my 
money, Ralph? Going out to 
forget your worries? Good 
luck." Ralph wished it were an 
old-fashioned door so he could 
slam it. 

An escalator wffiisked him 
downstairs and out of the 
mansion. The air was crisp 
and a salt tang came from a 
nearby canal. The two moons 
were out. He got in his car, 
punched the keyboard, and 
sank back wearily in the seat 
as the car rose slowly, gained 
speed, and hummed through 
the cloudless air. Below and 
far behind him now, the man- 



sion loomed darkly like a gre.it 
crouching monster, iilce a 
blight on the Martian land- 
scape, like a prison. 

The car whizzed over a 
gaudy resort hotel. Ralph's 
eyes hungrily watched it dwin- 
dle to a speck on the horizon. 
How he wished he might live 
there. Or anywhere. Any- 
where but in his father's 
house. 

STRID was already dress- 
ed and waiting for him. 
For one moment he forgot his 
father as he looked at her. She 
was sheathed in green velvon 
that matched exactly the 
green of her eyes and made 
them seem to leap from her 
face, so startling was their 
color. They were her best fea- 
ture. Her nose veered slightly 
to one side, and her mouth was 
perhaps too large, and she had 
more chin than the classic 
sculptors thought proper for a 
woman, but it w^as a face he 
loved, every defect of it, and 
she was the most beautiful 
woman on Mars to him. 

“I'm glad you're early, dar- 
ling," she said. “I hoped you 
would be. We'll have time for a 
drink before the show. And we 
can have a nice slow ride to 
the theater." She came for- 
ward and wrapped her arms 
around him and soaked him 
with her warmth until the 
blood throbbed in his head. A 
nice slow ride. Sure. But he 
was sick of cramped and fur- 
tive spasms in the car. She 

81 




HIS FATHER’S HOUSE 




seemed almost to read his 
thoughts. “Unless you want to 
come back here later?” 

“You know I can’t do that. 
Let’s go.” 

“We don’t have to leave yet, 
Ralph.” She sat down on a 
couch. “Why don’t you read 
me your latest chapters? Do 
you have them with you ?” 

“I — I read you the latest 
chapters last week. I haven’t 
done anything else on it.” 
“Darling, that was two 
weeks ago. And you haven’t 
written anything since? Why 
not?” 

He frowned. “You can’t 
turn it on and off like a faucet, 
Astrid. It just won’t come.” 
“But that’s not like you, 
Ralph. You’ve never had trou- 
ble getting things down on 
paper. That novelette last win- 
ter — You did the first draft 
in two days and nights.” She 
smiled. “You looked terrible 
when it was finished, but you 
did it. And in those awful sur- 
roundings! Libraries, the col- 
lege dorm, in the shower room 
after lights out. You should be 
able to get a lot of work done 
in that big mansion. Just lock 
yourself in with a pot of 
coffee.” 

He sank to the couch beside 
her. “Yes, I should,” he 
sighed. 

“And . She hesitated, 
smoothed her dress. “I didn’t 
say anything the last time, be- 
cause I thought you’d catch it 
yourself and rewrite, but 
those last chapters . 



“What about them?” 

“They weren’t good, dear. 
It’s been happening slowly, 
Ralph, but your work has been 
steadily deteriorating for 
some time now ...” 

“For a year,” he said. “Ever 
since I left college and moved 
into the mansion.” 

“Well, yes. Darling, what is 
it? What’s happening to you? 
Is anything wrong?” 

He turned to her and, for a 
moment, she thought he was 
going to say something, relieve 
himself of the burden he seem- 
ed to have been carrying all 
these months. For his face 
softened: briefly, he was the 
old Ralph again. But then it 
was gone and he only said, 
“Everything’s fine. Don’t 
worry. Let’s go.” 

I N THE car, he punched the 
top-speed button and they 
were hurled into the air. 

“We have plenty of time,” 
she protested. 

“I need that drink,” he said. 
“Ralph, there is something 
wrong.” She took his arm. 
“Tell me. Is it anything I said 
about coming back to the 
apartment? Wouldn’t you 
want to, if you could?” 

“Of course I’d want to. If 
I could. But you know I can’t, 
so why do you keep harping on 
it? I told you a hundred times : 
I can’t live anywhere but in 
the mansion. I can’t even stay 
overnight anywhere else. I’d 
lose my inheritanee if I did. 
You know what would happen 



82 



RAY RUSSELL 




if I went back with you. I’d 
be there all night.” 

“I still don’t understand 
why we couldn’t go back to 
your — ” 

“Here’s the cocktail lounge.” 
The car dropped, skidded, 
bumped to a halt. They got 
out. A rolling plush carpet 
carried them inside and direct- 
ly to a table. Ralph ordered a 
double Marsini. When it pop- 
ped up in front of him through 
the hole in the table, he seized 
the iced glass and drank down 
half of it in a gulp. Then, sav- 
agely, he crammed it back 
down the hole and barked to- 
ward the hidden microphone, 
“Not dry enough ! Your robot 
needs a new indexing.” 
Bravely ignoring his bad 
humor, Astrid continued what 
she had started to say in the 
car. “Ralph, I’d love to see that 
rambling old mansion of yours. 
After the show, why couldn’t 
we—” 

“No. Just no.” 

They had been over it doz- 
ens of times before and he was 
tired of making excuses. He 
had no excuses left. What 
could he say: You can’t come 
to the mansion because I don’t 
want you to see my father? 
That would make a lot of 
sense, wouldn’t it? 

Another Marsini came up 
through the hole. Ralph tasted 
it. Just right. Almost pure 
Earth gin, with just a touch of 
the pungent vermouth made 
from the wild "grapes” of 
Mars. 



He noticed Astrid had no 
glass. “You’re not drinking?” 
he asked. 

"I don’t want a drink. May- 
be you ought to take me home 
and just forget about the 
show. Forget about me, too.” 
“Honey . He reached 
over and took her hand. “I’m 
sorry. Try to put up with my 
orneriness, will you? Just for 
a little while longer? Until we 
can get married?” 

“A little while longer? Four 
more years? Oh, I want to, 
Ralph, but it’s been so long 
already . .” Her voice broke. 

“Don’t cry, honey. Please 
don’t cry.” 

“Take me home, Ralph.” 
“Aw, baby . .” 

“I’m not angry, Ralph, I 
love you and I want you and I 
can’t understand all this crazy 
business about the mansion 
and your inheritance. I don’t 
understand why we can’t get 
married and live there, if you 
must. You said you’d tell me 
some day. Tell me now.” 

“You wouldn’t like it there, 
believe me, honey. Come on, 
let’s go to the show.” 

“I don’t feel like seeing the 
show. Please take me home.” 
A formless fear grew in his 
belly, climbed coldly up his 
body, was transformed into 
thought in his mind: I’m los- 
ing her. 

R alph left her at her 
apartment and drove 
about aimlessly, finally ending 
up at the theater. The show 



HIS FATHER’S HOUSE 



83 




was an unfortunate choice: a 
space opera extolling the 
glories of the first uranium 
miners on Mars and the hard- 
ships endured by the settlers 
from Earth. It reminded him 
of his father, Henry Ganner, 
the shrewdest, most hard- 
working frontiersman of 
them all, the man who took 
Mars in his tough hands and 
shaped it into a colony, “Cut- 
throat Ganner” had already 
become a legend. 

Technically, the show was 
perfect : life-size characters in 
three dimensions walked, 
seemingly, among the audi- 
ence. The theater became, by 
turns, the interior of a space- 
ship, a Martian desert, a set- 
tler’s cabin. The audience 
loved it. But Ralph found it in- 
tolerable. He wished there 
were an old-fashioned theater 
left on Mars — one in which the 
actors stayed put, in front, on 
a screen. But science had ren- 
dered screens archaic. 

Ralph got up and left. 

His car floated slowly over 
the desert. He recalled the 
rapt faces of the audience he 
had just been a part of. Had 
his face looked like that, too? 
Drugged and dull and blindly 
accepting the good, the bad, 
the true, the false, the mean- 
ingful and meaningless alike? 
He groaned aloud. What place 
was there for him in this 
world? How could he hope to 
stir their minds, bring excite- 
ment to their vapid faces with 
his words? Mars was sophisti- 

84 



cated only on the surface: 
scratch the veneer and you’d 
find a frontiersman, every 
time. They were all a bunch of 
Cut-throat Ganners. And he 
was a Ganner, too. A true 
Ganner, by right of descent. 
The firstborn. The only child 
of the great Ganner, and that 
only child was — a scribbler. 
Side-splitting irony. But Ralph 
was not inclined to laugh. 

In the distance, he saw the 
mansion, and he turned the 
car around, reluctant to go 
home. 

“Home,” Ralph mumbled. 
“Home, sweet home.” He 
punched top speed and shot 
dizzily upward. “Hell, sweet 
hell.” The car climbed higher 
and higher, building up speed, 
its hum growing ominously 
loud. The air became thin. His 
chest heaved, but he did not 
switch on the oxygen. Sweat 
broke out on his forehead, 
then all over his body. “Hell, 
sweet hell,” he repeated craz- 
ily. “There’s no place like 
hell.” Suddenly he cut off the 
power. 

The hum died into silence 
long before the speeding car 
stopped its upward climb and 
began to fall. His stomach 
leaped toward his throat as 
the car plummeted toward the 
ground. His feet dug into the 
floor. The air screamed past, 
rising with his own yell, as the 
rusty surface of Mars came 
closer and closer. 

He snapped on the power 
just in time, and the abrupt 

RAY RUSSELL 




lurch threw him out of the 
seat. Sobbing now, he turned 
the car toward the mansion. 
His thinking was clarified by 
the brush with death. He real- 
ized that writers have always 
had to hammer their work into 
unreceptive minds. No, the 
real trouble stemmed from the 
same source his troubles had 
always stemmed from. ''Fa- 
ther,*' he muttered. "Some- 
thing will have to be done 
about Father.** 

T he old man wasn*t waiting 
for him when he walked 
through the door. Ralph was 
mildly surprised. Feeling the 
need of another drink, he went 
directly to the bar. As he stir- 
red the gin and Martian ver- 
mouth, he tried to think of a 
way to get rid of the old man 
once and for all. 

"Drinking again, Ralph?** 
His father was standing in the 
doorway. "Drowning your sor- 
rows? Good idea. Swill it 
down. Mop it up. Drink until 
your bi'ain softens and purple 
snakes crawl up your legs. 
Bottoms up.** 

Ralph threw the glass at his 
father, but it went right 
through him. "Bottoms up,** 
the old man repeated. Then he 
chuckled : a dry, cracked 

chuckle. "Don’t you wish you 
could kill me, Ralph? But how, 
eh? That’s the question. How 
can j^ou kill a dead man?” The 
crooked old figure walked 
slowly to the other side of the 
room. "What a problem. Boy 



would like to kill his father, 
but father is already dead. 
Very difficult.** He chuckled 
again. Ralph left the bar. 
"Through drinking already?** 

When Ralph entered the li- 
brary, his father was there. 
"Ah,” said the old man. 
"Books: that*s the stuff. You 
always were a bookworm. 
Bury yourself in books. Much 
better than liquor. Escapism, 
that*s the ticket,** 

How long could it go on, 
Ralph asked himself desper- 
ately — how many recordings 
had his father made before he 
died? It was a full year since 
his death, and still they went 
on — maddeningly lifelike, 
three-dimensional, technically 
perfect, talking, nagging, nee- 
dling, insulting . 

"May I suggest Shake- 
speare?** his father asked. "A 
favorite of yours, isn't he? 1 
never did hold with filling the 
mind with foolishness written 
a dozen centuries ago, but 
here and there that Shake- 
speare says something pretty 
good. In Macbeth, for in- 
stance: 'The time has been 
that when the brains v/ere out, 
the man would die, and there 
an end, but now they rise 
again ...*** 

Ralph walked to the dooi*. 
"Oh, don't go,” said his father, 
a special recording immediate- 
ly switching on as Ralph broke 
the photoelectric beam. "Stay 
and chat a while with an old 
man.” 

And Ralph stayed. Because 

8.5 



HIS FATHER’S HOUSE 




he knew his father would be 
in his bedroom, too, if he 
sought refuge there. The house 
was infested with reproduc- 
ers, all well stocked with 
images of his father, each 
room having its own appro- 
priate repertoire — remarks 
about drinking for the bar, 
about books for the library, 
and about insomnia for the 
bedrooms . 

“If you cared to,” his father 
rattled on, “you could rave at 
me like Macbeth raved at 
what’s-his-name : ‘Avant, and 
quit my sight! Let the earth 
hide thee!’ Or, in this case, 
‘Let Mars hide thee !’ Although 
that spoils the meter, doesn’t 
it? Oh, yes, I know about 
meter. I’m no writer like you, 
Ralph boy, but your old dad 
isn’t as stupid as you’d like to 
believe . 

Where were they? Ralph 
had searched the mansion 
again and again for the repro- 
ducers and their automatic 
switches, but never had he 
found even one. The mansion 
had been constructed to his 
father’s specifications, years 
ago, and old Ganner had want- 
ed to go one better the modern 
vogue for hidden reproducers. 
They were hidden, all right. 
Hidden so cleverly that only 
Ganner and the architect knew 
where they were. The old man 
liked to startle his guests by 
suddenly sending a recorded 
fleet of spaceships blazing 
through the dining room or in- 
troducing a handsome actor 



into the bathroom of a shriek- 
ing maiden lady. Ralph had 
thought of the architect, in his 
despair. Had thought of him 
and called his Earth office, 
only to learn that he had died 
fifteen years before. 

R alph would always re- 
member the day the will 
was read by the robot legal 
machine. In the jerky, precise 
syllables that tried to simulate 
human speech but only suc- 
ceeded in sounding like a par- 
ody of a Gregorian chant, he 
had heard his father’s words 
quoted : 

“To my only living relative, 
my son, Ralph Ganner, I leave 
one-third of my moneys, in- 
vestments and lands, to be his 
five years from the date of my 
death, subject to the following 
condition : that he make Gan- 
ner Mansion his exclusive 
home during those five years. 
Should he reside elsewhere, 
even for a single night, the in- 
heritance shall become void 
and shall become the property 
of the Mars-Ganner Corpora- 
tion, heirs of the remaining 
two-thirds . .” 

It was a strange condition, 
and Ralph was not in favor of 
the idea, but he did want the 
one-third inheritance. His fa- 
ther had given him a ridicu- 
lously small allowance at col- 
lege, and had threatened to cut 
it off the moment he graduat- 
ed. Ralph was rather surpris- 
ed to learn his father had left 
him anything at all, but he 



86 



RAY RUSSELL 




was glad of it, for now he 
could be independent and de- 
vote all of his time to work- 
ing at his writing. 

And there was Astrid. She 
had fallen in love with him at 
college, before she even knew 
he bore the powerful name of 
Ganner, and she would stand 
by him through the lean years. 
But why should there be lean 
years for her? She deserved 
the best. Now they could be 
married at once and move into 
the mansion. The stipulation 
that he could not leave it for a 
single night was disagreeable, 
but Ralph knew better than to 
try to break a will drawn up 
by a robot legal system. It was 
a system set up by Cut-throat 
Ganner himself, in the days 
when Mars was lawless, and it 
had served men well in the 
emergency. The emergency 
\vas long since past, but objec- 
tions to the no longer needed 
system went unheeded by the 
corporation that controlled the 
planet. The robot lawyers con- 
tinued to dispense their cor- 
rect, cold, irrevocable, rule- 
book law. 

The very first day he moved 
into the mansion, he knew he 
could not bring Astrid there. 
For he had not even unpacked 
when he heard a voice be- 
hind him in the bedroom. “So 
you accept my condition, 
Ralph?” 

He turned around and saw 
his father and a yelp of pri- 
mordial fear was torn from 
his throat. The blood left his 



face and his throat became as 
dry as a Martian desert. 

The ghost went on speak- 
ing: "I thought you would. 
Always ready to spend your 
dad’s dough, aren’t you? 
Never willing to work for it, 
though. Not a chance of that. 
Mama’s boy is an artist. 
Mama’s boy is just going to 
sit on his can and dream up 
pretty ways to string words 
together. Take a job in the 
corporation? Follow in his 
father’s steps? Gracious, what 
an idea ! 

“No, I’m not a visitor from 
the spirit world, Ralphie. I’m 
dead as a doornail and this old 
gent you’re looking at is only 
a recording made a couple of 
years ago. There are plenty 
of recordings like this, Ralph. 
I kept myself very busy mak- 
ing them when I knew I was 
going to die. Didn’t want you 
to be lonesome in this big old 
mansion all by yourself. I’ll 
keep you company often. We’ll 
live together, just you and I, 
for five years. Then — if you 
still have your wits — you can 
claim the rest of your inheri- 
tance. You’ll have earned it!” 
The image laughed. “Fair 
enough? Well, I’ll let you think 
that over alone. Good-by for 
now. I’ll be back.” 

And the image had walked 
out of the door and vanished. 

N OW, a year later, it was 
still talking as Ralph sat 
with bowed head in the library 
of Ganner Mansion. “ ‘Thy 



HIS FATHER’S HOUSE 



87 




bones are marrovvless, thy 
blood is cold, thou hast no 
speculation in those eyes 
which thou dost glare with.’ 
How’s that for writing, 
writer? Pretty good stuff, eh? 
Makes sense, doesn’t it? Now 
listen to me, Ralph. Listen to 
me carefully. You’ve had a 
year of this. Have you had 
enough? Then I’ll let you in on 
a little secret. The robot law- 
yer didn’t tell you everything. 
It was carefully instructed, 
carefully indexed to keep back 
one little bit of infonnation. 
And this is it: I’m willing to 
remain in my grave and never 
pester you further. I’m willing 
to let you have your inheri- 
tance, too. On condition.” 

“Conditions!” Ralph hissed, 
then was angry with himself 
for having talked back to a 
lifeless image twice in one day, 

“The condition is this: 
That you accept a position in 
Mars-Ganner. That you carry 
on. That you be my son. I want 
that, Ralph. It will take away 
some of the bitterness of dying 
if a Ganner continues here on 
Mars. The Ganner name is 
Mars, Ralph! You should be 
proud of it and live up to it. 
You should be the son of your 
father. The lawyer knows 
what to do. Just call it and tell 
it you’re going to take over the 
corporation. Tomorrow, tech- 
nicians will arrive to remove 
the image-spools from the re- 
producers. It’s up to you, 
Ralph.” 

The image was gone. Ralph 



sat alone in the silence of the 
library. His dead father’s 
words still echoed in his mind. 
The hard-headed old tyrant. 
The selfish, money-grubbing 
egomaniac. All Mars had been 
his domain and in his life he 
had never let any one forget 
it. His own anti-intellectual 
tastes had shaped Martian so- 
ciety, made it a cultureless 
vacuum, with no roots in 
man’s rich past and no hope of 
future growth. How the idea 
of death must have gnawed at 
him, until his jungle mind had 
hit on the way to reach out, 
after death, and puli the 
strings even then ! 

Absently, Ralph looked up 
at a nearby shelf of books, a 
set of antiques, collectors’ 
items purchased by his father 
to fill the walls. Terse titles 
seemed to mock Ralph’s dilem- 
ma: Caught, Nothing, Pack 
My Bag. And equally terse 
titles by the same ancient 
writer, a man named Green, 
seemed to speak tauntingly of 
those things Ralph could no 
longer hope for; Living, Lov- 
ing. 

He could leave. Walk out 
and never come back. And his 
father could haunt the man- 
sion forever if he wanted to, 
because Ralph wouldn’t be 
there to listen to him, to look 
at his hard, aged face. Pack 
My Bag. But then he would 
be a pauper. His novelette had 
brought him a decent check — 
but that had been over a year 
ago, and it had been the first

Astrid couldn’t exist on the in- 
come from his writing. Not

He could accept the position

and be richer than any other 
man in the Solar System. And 
hate every minute of it. 
Caught, 

Astrid. Living. Loving. She 
had fallen in love with a 
writer. Could he ask her to 
love a corporation boss, an or- 
ganization man of a stripe 
that would make that ancient 
symbol, the man in the gray 
flannel suit, seem a soaring 
free spirit by comparison? 

Nothing, 

He shivered. The chill of the 
Martian night was seeping 
into the mansion . 

that be all, Mr. 

W Ganner?” 

“Yes, Miss Reeves,” said 
Ralph. “Get those letters out 
as soon as possible, please.” 

“Yes, sir. Oh — Fm to re- 
mind you that you and Mrs. 
Ganner are giving a reception 
for that folk dance troupe 
from Earth tonight. And will 
you be able to sec Mr. Krenek 
this afternoon about the li- 
brary?” 

“I doubt it. Anyway, I 
thought that was all settled,” 

“Mr. Krenek wants to dis- 
cuss the name of the library. 
He assumes you wish to call it 
the Henry Ganner Memorial 
Library, after your father, 
but I suspect he wants to talk 



you into naming it after your- 
self.” 

“Fm too young to become 
a memorial. Miss Reeves. Tell 
Mr. Krenek he may name it 
after anybody the committee 
chooses, except me. My per- 
sonal preference, if he’s inter- 
ested, is to call it the Henry 
Green Memorial Library.” 
“Yes, sir.” Miss Reeves 
seemed just a trifle puzzled. 
“Mr. Ganner — what shall 1 
tell Mr. Krenek when he asks 
me who Henry Green was ?” 

A smile momentarily flashed 
across Ralph Ganner’s face. 
“Tell him — no, just tell him 
Green was a twentieth-cen- 
tury novelist, all but forgot- 
ten, whose collected works are 
being made available again

Reeves, Henry Green was the 
pseudonym of an ancient ty- 
coon who successfully com- 
bined a life of business with a 
life of art. He did this, they 
sa 3 ^ by writing during his 
lunch hour. Isn’t that simple?” 
“Yes, Mr. Ganner.” 

“So absurdly simple . 
And speaking of lunch, 
shouldn’t you have yours?” 
“Yes, sir. Fm leaving now. 
Are you sure you wouldn’t like 
me to send you in something? 
A sandwich? Some soup?” 
“No, thanks, Miss Reeves. I

will you lock my door?”

led him up the beach away 
from the water. “Well, every 
town is noted for something. 
Like one’s the lettuce capital 
and another’s the wine center. 
It certainly doesn’t hurt San 
Miguel to be known.’’ 

Wheelan turned from the 
glare that the city’s lights 
made against the faintly over- 
cast sky. “Ever since I was a 
kid I’ve hated cats. They make 
me feel crawly all over. Like 
persimmons do.” 

“Persimmons don't do any 
such thing," Karen said, toss- 
ing her cigarette at the foam 
below. 

“So I come back to my old 
home town. Unpack my bags 
and walk into my aunt’s 
homey kitchen, and she 
springs it on me." 

“What?” 

“She’s one of them now, too. 
It’s not bad enough a bunch of 
retired dentists from Omaha 
go along with Balderstone. My 
aunt now! I’ll have a hell of 
a time forcing down second 
helpings. I get this crawly 
feeling.” 

“You’re as touchy as Pav- 
lov’s dog. Everything makes 
you crawly.” 

“Well, look, Karen. You’ve 
been up at Cal most of the 
year. Doesn’t the place seem 
odder to you ?” Wheelan step- 
ped next to a driftwood log. 
“Doesn’t it bother you?" 

K aren sat down on the log 
and put her elbows on her 
knees. “I told you, Glenn, San 



Miguel looks newer and clean- 
er. Why, even the slums look 
better. I think they’ve painted 
them.” 

“The only time we ever had 
a cat, when I was eleven, it 
made me sneeze. My aunt 
made me give it away. I want- 
ed to drown it in a gunny sack 
but she talked me out of it.” 
“Oh, you couldn’t have. 
You’re too tender and kindly.” 
She held her hand out and 
motioned him down beside 
her. 

Wheelan sat, feeling the 
sand seep in over the sides of 
his loafers. “Maybe I’ll talk 
to Neff. There should be a law 
against this kind of thing.” 
“Chief Neff ? I doubt if he’ll 
do anything.” 

“Why?” 

“Because he’s so active on 
our Civic Public Relations 
Committee. And he owns a 
couple of motels.” 

Wheelan absently put his 
hand on Karen’s shoulder. 
“Now, somebody must be 
against this. Maybe Dr. 
Watchers. He was even 
against free paper towels in 
the public Johns.” 

“He passed away,” Karen 
said, moving Wheelan’s arm 
around her with her shoul- 
ders. 

“I could write to the gov- 
ernor,” Wheelan said, notic- 
ing Karen’s soft dark hair 
fluttering faintly over the tip 
of his nose. “There must be a 
law against lycanthropy.” 
Karen shook her head. “No.

They checked on it. There is 
in one of the New England 
states. The dunking stool is 
the penalty, I think.” 

“Why?” he said in a loud 
voice. 

“Why dunking?” 

“No,” Wheelan said, blow- 
ing her hair out of his face. 
“Why do people want to turn 
into cats anyway? My God, it 
must feel crawly.” 

“Well, you know what Mr. 
Balderstone says.” 

“He’s a quack.” 

“Perhaps. But nevertheless 
he perfected a method for 
turning people into cats and 
back. And that’s more than a 
lot of people have done. He 
can’t be all quack.” Karen re- 
laxed and snuggled back 
against Wheelan. 

“Who the hell else would 
want to discover something 
like that? You might just as 
well invent an economical 
method of canning persim- 
mons.” Wheelan shuddered. 
“Cats.” 

Karen closed her eyes. 
“Anyway, he says it’s a great 
tension-reliever. People get 
out of themselves. Forget 
their troubles. Aggressions. 
'That’s very important in 
times like these when every- 
one is worrying about blow- 
ing up unexpectedly.” 

Wheelan tightened his arm 
around her. “Damn. When I 
think of all those people going 
out to the old fairgrounds and 
turning into cats and yowling 
around it . 



“Makes you crawly?” 
Wheelan turned her head up 
and kissed her. 

Karen’s tongue shot under 
his and back and she pulled 
away. “You take everything 
too seriously. Mr. Balderstone 
has a way of helping people 
relax. So what? What’s that 
Latin thing about disputan- 
dum and all?” 

“Yeah, but a whole town. 
My town and yours ! And it’s 
given over to turning people 
into cats.” 

“My town and yours! You 
sound like Chief Neff.” She 
kissed him on the cheek. “Hey. 
Last summer we didn’t spend 
all this time debating.” 

W HEELAN smiled quickly. 

“I’m maturing. Once you 
pass twenty-six you get wis- 
dom. You’ll see.” 

“I say if they want to be 
cats let them. It’s very good 
therapy. And Lord knows we 
need it.” 

“It’s not right.” 

Karen sighed. “What was 
that comic strip when we were 
kids, about the cat and the 
mouse? Cicero’s Cat?” 
“Krazy Kat?” 

She nodded. “You’re like 
that mouse. Always have to go 
around throwing bricks at the 
cats. And it always got him in 
trouble. Ignatz. That was his 
name, Ignatz Mouse. That’s 
who you are.” 

“Very profound insight.” 
Wheelan ran his hand down 
her back, touching each of the

white buttons on her sweater.

thing about iV 

Though she was facing 
away Wheelan could feel her 
smile. “Glenn?'' she said. 

He undid the first small but- 
ton. “Yeah?" 

“I went out there last week. 
And it is quite relaxing. I've 
felt much happier this week." 

Wheelan got to the second 
button before he realized 
what she had said. “Karen, 
you're kidding!" 

“No. So you see, it’s nothing 
so terrible." 

Wheelan stood up. “Damn 
it. Damn it!” 

Karen rose, reaching behind 
her to rebutton her sweater. 
“You're being pretty intoler- 
ant." 

“Damn it, the whole town !" 
I (e backed away, his feet sink- 
ing deep in the cold sand. 

Karen shrugged. “Don't 
take it so big." She looked up 
at him hopefully, “Well, you'll 
at least drive me home?" 

Belatedly, Wheelan said, 
“Sure. Come on." Near his 
car he said quietly, “Now I'm 
really going to get them." 

I T wasn't until the next 
Wednesday that Wheelan 
had his leaflets ready to hand 
out. The local printers had, 
one way and another, refused 
the job. He'd had to have 
them done in Santa Monica. 

The two cub scouts he'd 
hired to help him had both 
come down with something 



late Tuesday. Wheelan sta- 
tioned himself on Chambers 
Drive near the two largest 
tourist motels early on the 
clear June morning. 

He had handed out five of 
his anti-lycanthropy leaflets 
when Chief Harold Neff drove 
up on his official motorcycle. 
Wheelan spotted him a block 
away by his gold-painted 
crash helmet. It was the only 
one on the force. 

“Hi, there, Glenn," said 
Neff, after he'd parked the 
cycle in a red zone. “What are 
3^011 up to?” 

Wheelan frowned at the 
chief's broad, tanned face. 
“I'm agitating, Hal.” 

Neff rubbed his jaw. “With- 
out a permit, though?" 

“As a matter of fact, yes.” 

The chief nodded. “You'll 
have to stop. You can't hand 
out those things without a 
permit.” 

Wheelan tucked his box of 
leaflets up under his arm. 
“Who do I see about a per- 
mit?” 

“Me, Glenn.” Chief Neff 
flipped off his helmet and 
stroked his crewcut, looking 
down the street. “Let's go 
down to the Blue Oasis and 
have a beer and talk." 

“Can you drink while on 
duty?” 

“Beer.” He took Wheelan's 
arm. 

“What about your motor- 
cycle?” 

“Won't come to any harm.” 

In one of the Blue Oasis’s

dark leather booths Neff 
said, '‘Don't you like the way 
the old town's blossoming, 
Glenn ?'’ 

"Cats make me feel crawly," 
Wheelan said, pushing his 
schooner back and forth in 
front of him. 

"Why, even the slums are a 
sight to see. And San Miguel's 
getting to be a well-liked spot. 
Like Capistrano and Disney- 
land. Being well-liked is good 
for a town's civic pride." The 
chief grinned at Wheelan. 

"I think there's something 
basically wrong with people 
turning into cats." Wheelan 
made up his mind not to drink 
the beer. 

"There might be something 
wrong in it if people did it 
out of spite or for mischief, 
Glenn. But I think most com- 
petent authorities will agree 
that Mr. Balderstone’s method 
has a real, honest-to-gosh 
therapeutic value." He looked 
straight at Wheelan. "There's 
a lot of nervous tension these 
days, Glenn. Even teaching in 
Pasadena you must have seen 
that." 

"Well, Hal, I'll admit that. 
I just don't think Balder- 
stone's approach is any solu- 
tion." 

Neff laughed. "There's not 
really much solution to any- 
thing." He leaned back into 
the shadows in the booth cor- 
ner. "You're as interested in 
our town as anybody, aren't 
you, Glenn? Growing up here, 
playing in the Little League, 



attending Grover Cleveland 
High." 

"Sure. That's why I hate to 
see it taken over by some 
crackpot cult." 

"You're entitled to your 
opinions. Just don't hand 
them out in the form of leaf- 
lets." 

"About that permit?" 

"Well, Glenn, you know how 
tangled in red tape any gov- 
ernment gets. It'll take time. 
Even with me putting the 
spurs to everybody. Uh, 
you're leaving the first part of 
September?" 

"Yeah, when school opens." 
Wheelan pushed his glass 
away and slid out of the booth. 
"It'll take until early Septem- 
ber to get the permit, huh?" 

"No. With me seeing to it 
you should have it by the end 
of August." He stood and 
shook hands. Something about 
shaking hands with Chief 
Neff unsettled Wheelan. Try- 
ing not to show it, he walked 
with Neff out into the light. 

W HEELAN was squatting, 
studying the bottom 
shelves of his aunt's refriger- 
ator. He looked into an opened 
tin of smoked oysters, then 
decided against making a 
sandwich. He opened a can of 
beer and sat down at the 
white-topped table. This was 
the night his aunt went 
out to Balderstone's. Wheelan 
shivered. They even had spe- 
cial buses running out there. 
The doorbell rang, or rather 



94 



RON GOULART 




chimed a tune that had been 
a favorite of his aunt’s during 
prohibition. Karen Wylie was 
standing on the front porch 
in a big tan coat. “Hi,” she 
said. “Busy?” 

“Pretty much.” 

She glanced at his hand. 
“Can I have a beer?” 

Wheelan moved back so she 
could enter. 

After he’d taken her coat 
and brought her a beer Karen 
said, “What are you up to 
now ?” 

“Well, I sent letters to both 
our local papers, but they 
haven’t been printed. I sup- 
pose you know about my try- 
ing to hand oyt leaflets last 
week. Then I tried to rent a 
soundtruck, but Neff says I 
need a permit for that, too.” 
He sat down on his aunt’s 
chintz-covered sofa. “Now I’m 
doing a mail campaign.” 
“Why don’t you give up?” 
Karen watched him with an 
anxious expression. “What 
good are you doing?” 

“I think that every citizen 
has a right to act as he choos- 
es. I mean, when an evil exists 
it’s the individual’s right to 
try to combat it.” 

“With leaflets?” 

“In any way he can,” 
Wheelan said. 

She .smiled. “You just look 
silly. And you’ll annoy people. 
Really, Glenn, what’s wrong 
with all this? You’re just 
judging others by your own 
standards. All this talk about 
good and evil.” 



“I don’t think people should 
turn into cats. If they have to, 
I don’t think our town should 
encourage them.” He clench- 
ed his fists. “Why, they’ve got 
signs on the road now, telling 
how far it is to Balderstone’s 
temple, or whatever he calls 
it.” 

“There’s certainly nothing 
unethical in advertising, 
Glenn. You’re not that nar- 
row-minded.” 

Wheelan finished his beei- 
and bent the can in half. He 
was angry enough to do it 
with one hand. “Let’s forget 
it. How’ve you been?” 

“Wonderful.” She touched 
one hand to her temple. “Very 
I'elaxed.” 

“Which is your night in the 
temple?” 

Karen frowned. “Oh, I've 
only dropped out a couple of 
times.” 

Rubbing his hands slowly 
together, Wheelan said, “I’m 
trying to start an anti-cat 
league, Karen. Would you 
join?” 

Karen laughed and stood 
up. “How many members have 
you got?” 

“I just started mailing yes- 
terday.” 

“But so far?” 

“None.” He picked Karen’s 
coat off the chair he draped it 
on. “Thanks for dropping in.” 

Getting into her coat Karen 
said, “Take it easy, Glenn, 
will you?” 

“I have to do what I think 
is right.”

Karen was smiling as he 
held the door open for her. 

I T was a foggy night, two 
nights after Wheelan had 
picketed the fairgrounds and 
been run off by Chief Neff. 
Wheelan had decided to walk 
down toward the beach after 
dinner. His aunt wasn't 
speaking to him. Nor was she 
cooking for him. He got a 
hamburger at a drive-in 
across the road from the long 
narrow San Miguel beach ; 
then wandered through the 
fog toward the last sidewalk 
before the sand. 

He heard a car slow behind 
him, then saw the nose of a 
Ford convertible slide out of 
the thickening mist. Eventu- 
ally he saw Karen, her dark 
hair in a thin scarf, smiling 
at him from behind the wheel. 
'‘You mad?" she called. 

Wheelan finished the liam- 
burger and wiped his hands 
on his pocket handkerchief. 
“More or less.” 

“Want to come along for a 
drive?” 

He came up to the passen- 
ger side of the front seat. 
“Why don't you put the lop 
down?” 

“I like the way the fog feels. 
Come on.” She stretclied 
across the front seat and 
opened the door. 

‘'Someplace in particular?” 
He caught the door as it 
swung out. 

“Well, yes. Somebody wants 
to see you.” 

96 



“Oh?” He got in. “You play- 
ing messenger now?” 

“Don't be nasty. This is for 
your own good, or I wouldn't 
be doing it.” 

“Okay. 1 take your word 
for it.” Wheelan stretched his 
legs out as far as they would 
go and folded his arms. 

Karen made a U-turn on the 
smooth street and drove care- 
fully back through the town. 

Near the fairgrounds 
Wheelan asked, “You taking 
me to the meeting with you?” 

Karen shook her head, turn- 
ing the car sharply up a steep, 
ti’ee-lined street. They stopped 
in front of a ranch-style bun- 
galow. “Here we are,” she 
said, getting out of the car. 

Wheelan followed her up a 
brick path, his hands in his 
pockets. The fog was tighten- 
ing in around them. 

A short man with a high, 
lined forehead and cropped 
gi*ay hair opened the door of 
the bungalow. “Evening, Kar- 
en,” he said, smiling. 

“Mr. Balderstone, Mi*. 
Wheelan,” Karen said. 

Wheelan nodded and came 
into the house after her. 

Balderstone stopped in 
front of a deep fireplace. 
“Thought we ought to have a 
chat.” 

“1 hear you mentioned me 
in your service the night 1 
picketed your place,” Wheelan 
said. 

“Explained to newcomers 
that you were the town eccen- 
tric.” Balderstone's heavy 



RON GOULART 




gray eyebrows slanted toward 
each other. “People come to 
my lectures — don’t call them 
services — ^to unbend. To relax. 
Don’t like to have somebody 
shouting at them through a 
megaphone and waving signs, 
Wheelan.” He crossed the 
room. “Drink?” 

Wheelan shook his head, 
glancing at Karen. 

She had sat in a straight 
back chair and folded her 
hands. “Scotch and soda,” she 
said to Balderstone. 

A fter he made the drinks 
Balderstone said, “Some 
consider me a benefactor, 
Wheelan. I have invented a 
somewhat unique thing. 
Applied lycanthropy — though 
most people think of that as 
involving only wolves.” He 
gestured, and ice rattled in his 
glass. “Cats have a much 
higher therapeutic value. It’s 
essential, Wheelan, for people 
to get out of themselves now 
and then. To find relief from 
tension so that their lives may 
be more rewarding and satis- 
fying.” He moved closer to 
Wheelan, who was still stand- 
ing near the door. “These are 
troubled times, Wheelan.” 
“I’ve told him that myself,” 
Karen said, trying her Scotch. 

“The results of applied ly- 
canthropy have been most 
positive. Not only have people 
been helped, but San Miguel 
has been helped. Don’t think 
other cities wouldn’t jump at 
the chance to have me locate 



there.” He cleared his throat. 
“As a matter of fact, we’re 
considering opening branches. 
It’s my intention to help the 
entire world.” 

“And it’s my intention to 
run you out of town,” Wheelan 
said. 

Balderstone laughed and 
shook his head. “Miss Wylie 
tells me you’re a decent fellow, 
basically, as are so many be- 
fore the pressures of everyday 
life remold them. At any rate, 
I simply want to point out 
that many of us are annoyed 
by you. I don’t think you want 
that.” 

“Yes, I do. I’m out to get 
you.” 

“You’re getting on my 
nerves.” Balderstone scratch- 
ed his nose. “Leaflets, pam- 
phlets, letters. Demonstra- 
tions. And now I get word 
that you’ve been going around 
to pet shops and florists try- 
ing to buy large quantities 
of catnip.” 

“Nobody has any.” 

“Of course not. And I also 
find that yesterday you visited 
the humane society in Santa 
Monica and tried to buy sev- 
eral big dogs. The trouble with 
you, Wheelan, you’ve got no 
civic pride.” 

Wheelan smiled. “I’m as 
proud of San Miguel as any- 
body.” 

“And further, Wheelan, you 
can’t stand to see people have 
a good time. And even worse, 
you’re against scientific prog- 
ress. I’m sure that had you

lived in Austria at the end of 
the last century you would 
have sent Sigmund Freud 
crank letters.” 

“He wasn’t a quack.” 

“You annoy me more up 
close than at a distance.” 

The two of them were drift- 
ing closer to each other. 

Karen jumped up. “Mr. 
Balderstone, perhaps if Glenn 
attended one of your lectures 
he wouldn’t be so prejudiced.” 
“I don’t want him sulking 
around my talks.” 

“But it might convince 
him,” 

Balderstone squinted one 
eye. “Hmm, Perhaps.” 

Wheelan shook his head. “I 
wouldn’t go near one.” 

“Oh, that’s right, Mr. Bald- 
erstone. Cats make him feel 
crawly.” 

Balderstone stroked his 
chin. “You’re in need of help 
yourself, Wheelan.” 

“Couldn’t he stand back- 
stage?” Karen came and took 
Wheelan’s arm. “I’ll stay with 
you, Glenn.” 

“He’d heckle,” said Balder- 
stone, checking his watch. 
“But if you’re willing to 
vouch for him — ” 

“I’m not going near that 
place,” Wheelan said, “unless 
it’s to burn it down.” 
Balderstone tightened his 
tie and studied Wheelan’s 
face. “Destroy city property? 
Fine citizen you are.” 

Karen tightened her grip on 
Wheelan’s arm. “Come, Glenn. 
I know you’ll think differently 



when you see the fine work 
Mr. Balderstone is doing.” 

Balderstone was half in a 
closet, selecting an expensive- 
looking coat. 

Wheelan said quietly to 
Karen, “You’re not going 

to . .?” 

“Change? Not tonight. 
Please come. I want you to be 
convinced.” 

Wheelan was aware that 
wouldn’t happen, but he was 
curious. “All right.” 

Everyone was smiling when 
they started for the fair 
grounds. 

B ALDERSTONE’S p 1 a t - 
form was set up at the 
edge of the field where tents 
were once pitched. Just to the 
left of the platform was the 
old merry-go-round that had 
become city property after the 
last carnival had gone broke. 
Balderstone’s narrow stage 
was backed by canvas flats, 
and Wheelan and Karen stood 
behind one of these on some 
machinery crates, watching 
the audience through a peep- 
hole in the canvas. 

“This isn’t my idea of back- 
stage,” Wheelan said, taking 
his eye from the hole so Karen 
could peek. 

“All of Mr. Balderstone’s 
money goes into improving 
his process. And things like 
that.” 

The night was getting cold- 
er and high mist hung over 
the fairgrounds. Only half of 
the bench seats were filled.

meaning probably about three 
hundred in attendance. 

When Wheelan looked out 
again the lights around the 
field had dimmed and the two 
young men with blond curly 
hair and double-breasted suits 
had stopped taking donations 
at the entrance arch. Balder- 
stone left the folding chair 
he’d been sitting in and walk- 
ed slowly across the stage 
planks to the mike. 

^^Nothing like a touch of 
cold to keep people home at 
nights,” he said, acknowledg- 
ing with a grin the laughter 
that followed. He smoothed 
the front of his coat and took 
a small blue leaflet out of his 
pocket. '‘Think you’ll find 
copies of this tacked to your 
seats. If you’re a regular you 
know the system. If not, best 
leaf through it.” 

About a third of the heads 
ducked to look for the leaflet. 
Balderstone pinched his nose 
and briefly glanced at the 
peephole. 

Karen slipped a leaflet into 
Wheelan’s hand. He tossed it 
aside. "You want to look 
again?” 

'^No, I know the procedure. 
You keep watching. You’re 
the one we want to convince.” 

She squeezed his arm gent- 
ly. 

"Lots of worry these days,” 
Balderstone said. "People 
don’t know where their next 
worry’s coming from.” 

Most of the heads, except 
the ones that were still bent 



over the leaflet, nodded in 
agreement. 

"Lots of problems people 
just can’t solve. But they still 
want to give it a try.” Balder- 
stone’s voice grew louder, 
"One more chance at bat. 
That’s not the way. Worrying 
about problems causes fret- 
ting. Fretting produces ten- 
sion. Tense people aren’t hap- 
py people.” Balderstone’s 
hands came up in front of his 
chest, gradually clenching. "If 
you can’t change the world, 
I’m informing you, you can 
change yourself. At least for 
awhile. That’s important. 
That’s what is called escape. 
It’s good for you. Applied 
lycanthropy.” 

The lights had been dim- 
ming all through his last sen- 
tences. A few yards from the 
merry-go-round the blond 
young men had a bonfire go- 
ing. 

"We’re going to lose all 
those worries. We’re not go- 
ing to fret. Not now, not for 
awhile.” Balderstone’s voice 
seemed to have taken on some 
of the crackle of the fire. 
"Every one of you should 
have a capsule. Now, who 
doesn’t?” 

A dozen hands went up and 
one of the young men ran 
through the crowd, giving out 
capsules from an orange card- 
board box. 

Balderstone had stepped out 
of Wheelan’s range, but he re- 
appeared wheeling something 
that looked like a giant sun-

lamp. It was half again as tall 
as he was. 

“He’s got enough quack 
equipment,” Wheelan said. 

“Be still,” Karen said, her 
hold tight now on his arm. 

‘‘Y^E’RE going to change,” 

^ shouted Balderstone, 
not using the microphone. 
“When I say ‘swallow’ I want 
you all to swallow those cap- 
sules. Then you better get out 
of your clothes quick ! Because 
when I turn on my applied 
lycanthropy beam things are 
going to start happening.” He 
had reached the platform edge 
and was crouched there, tee- 
tering. “Now ! One, two, three. 
Swallow!” 

Balderstone dived for the 
beam and clicked it on. Ties 
and hats shot up into the air. 
Coat sleeves flapped, became 
entangled with print dresses 
and lace slips. 

“Looks like Annapolis on 
graduation day,” Wheelan 
said softly, starting to feel 
uneasy. 

The beam was played over 
the audience, slowly from left 
to right. All the lights were 
out and there was only the 
dim orange flicker of the bon- 
fire. “Relax, relax,” Balder- 
stone shouted. “Change!” He 
dropped and sat on the stage 
edge. 

There was a sputtering 
howl near the entrance and a 
large black cat leaped up, 
clawing at the air, twisting 
and falling back. 



Wheelan couldn't breathe, 
couldn’t tell Karen to stop her 
fingernails from digging into 
his skin. 

Great yowling cats were 
popping up across the field, 
faster and faster. Wheelan 
noticed his dentist still hadn’t 
gotten his striped shorts off. 
Then he jerked back against 
Karen and they both tumbled 
off the crates. “Run,” he said. 

Karen twisted up and 
caught him. “No, Glenn. Wait. 
Till they change back. You’ll 
see how happy and calm they 
all are. You’ll be convinced.” 

“Cats,” he said, pulling 
away. “Run!” 

He ran; jumped the fence 
beyond the rodeo area and 
stumbled away into the brush. 
He got home in under an 
hour. It was mostly downhill. 

Two nights later Wheelan 
set fire to Balderstone’s bun- 
galow while he was away at 
the lecture. The fire depart- 
ment put out the fire before 
more than half of the house 
was gone. 

Early on the following 
morning he rented an airplane 
and had his remaining leaflets 
dropped over San Miguel. 

Wheelan had decided that 
if he couldn’t do anything 
positive he was still going 
to annoy Balderstone and any- 
body else who was on his side. 

No one mentioned his har- 
rassing actions to him, not 
even Chief Neff. Wheelan’s 
aunt did indicate that she 
would never cook another 



100 



RON GOULART 




meal or wash another pajama 
top for him. He moved to a 
run-down motel near the 
ocean. 

H e had been there nearly 
three days when, just aft- 
er sundown, someone knocked 
on his door. It was Karen, 
wearing a light cotton dress, 
her hair pulled back. '‘Are you 
comfortable, Glenn?'' 

He smiled, “Yeah. 1 like this 
business now. I've been think- 
ing up new activities." 

Karen frowned around the 
room. “Like to come out for 
a walk?'’ 

“Where?" 

“Oh, along the beach. You 
can't spend all your life in a 
damp motel room." 

“It's not damp. That's the 
fresh sea air you feel." He 
picked a windbreaker off the 
bed and nodded at the door. 
“So, let's walk.” The night 
was warm, but heavy with 
fog. “Son-y I left you up there 
the other night, Karen. But 
you know ..." 

“Yes. 1 know. Cats make 
you crawly." She took his 
hand when they reached the 
sidewalk and pulled him after 
her in the direction of the 
beach. “Have you really been 
doing all those annoying 
things, Glenn?” 

“Who else? You think I've 
gotten any I'ecruits?" The 
street was quiet. They left the 
last sidewalk and walked 
down through scrubby brush 
to the beach. The water looked 



blurred as it touched the 
misty shore. “Just me." 

Karen shivered and stepped 
away from Wheelan. “You've 
just made an awful nuisance 
of yourself, Glenn. I've always 
been very fond of you, as I'm 
sure you know. But — I'm very 
sorry.” 

She darted in suddenly and 
pushed hard. 

The surprise and the clump 
of brush behind him sent 
Wheelan over into the sand. 
When he got to his knees and 
looked around he caught a 
brief flicker of Karen's skiit 
in the fog. Then she was lost. 
He stood. He tried to brusli 
himself off, but his hands had 
started to shake. And he was 
beginning to feel odd in tlie 
stomach. 

Wind came in then across 
the water and scattered some 
of the mist. He saw the cats. 

Dozens of them, crouched 
twenty yards away. Their 
tails were switching and 
Wheelan became aware of a 
puzzling, whirring sound. 

Purring. 

In another gust more mist 
scattered, and Wheelan real- 
ized that he was cut off from 
the town by a half circle of 
hundreds of cats. And they 
were contentedly edging down 
across the sand toward him. 

Hundreds of damned cats! 
They made Wheelan feel so 
crawly he couldn't move. But 
if he didn't move soon the 
first of the cats would touch 
him. That thought made him 



IGNATZ 



101 




jump back. The cats moved 
up. 

The sand was sucking at his 
shoes; he could feel the chill 
of the ocean on the back of his 
neck. Maybe if he ran straight 
at them they'd scatter. But he 
couldn't do that. They knew 
that, too. The cats eased a 
little nearer. 

Wheelan bent and grabbed 
off his shoes, then his socks. 
He backed into the cold, wet 
sand near the water. He got 
out of his clothes — all except 
his shorts; he’d have to come 
ashore someplace. The cats 



were close now. For a moment 
Wheelan thought he wouldn't 
be able to move, but finally 
he was able to grin and thumb 
his nose. 

Then he ran quickly out 
into the water. 

It was dark and cold, but 
he was a fair swimmer. He 
could make it down the coast 
a quarter mile or so. Far 
enough. As he swam, Wheelan 
made up his mind he'd never 
come back to his home town 
again. 

Not even for Christmas.

TO THREAD ON A NECKLACE? 

What’s the most puzzling planet in the solar system? It might be 
Mercury, the nearest planet to the Sun, so cokl on one side that air 
freezes, so hot on the other that lead is a liquid. It is one of the bright- 
est objects in the sky — yet it has never been seen by most of the human 
race! 

The reason? Its nearness to the Sun. It is only rarely visible above 
the horizon except in daylight, although under the best viewing condi- 
tions it is almost as bright as Sirius or Jupiter. Yet that is not the 
oddest thing about this odd little world. For instance, what about its 
“bright spot”? This is a point of light as bright as the Sun itself on 
the center of Mercury’s disk, only seen when Mercury is directly between 
Sun and Earth. It has been seen many times, by astronomers of unques- 
tioned reliability. 

Sometimes it is explained as an optical phenomenon of Mercury’s 
atmosphere — but probably Mercury has none! A still more fascinating 
theory is that there is a tremendous tunnel extending clear through the 
planet — and the spot as bright as the Sun is really the Sun itself, viewed 
through a shaft some 3,000 miles long!

Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



T here is only one anthol- 
ogy for us to consider this 
month but it is monstrous 
huge. It is called A Treasury 
of Great Science Fiction. Its 
editor is Anthony Boucher, 
and it contains twenty-four 
separate stories — four of them 
full-length novels. 

The authors involved are 
John Wyndham, Richard 
Deming, Ray Bradbury, Rob- 
ert A. Heinlein (twice), 
Philip K. Dick, Henry Kutt- 
ner (once in collaboi'ation 
with C. L. Moore, and again 
alone, disguised as “Lewis 
Padgett”), C. M. Kornbluth, 
Theodore Sturgeon, George 
P. Elliott, Joel Townsley Rog- 
ers, Poul Anderson (twice), 
A. E. Van Vogt, Malcolm 
Jameson, Oscar Lewis, Judith 
Merril, George 0. Smith, Ar- 
thur C. Clarke, Nelson Bond, 
E. B. White, Mildred Clinger- 
man and Alfred Bester. This 
is a catholic list, as anyone 
can see. As nearly all the 
stories are good-to-excellent, 
perhaps there is no real rea- 
son to argue the editor’s se- 
lection ; it is after all a matter 
of individual taste, and any- 
way the anthologist who re- 
vives Heinlein’s Waldo and 
Kornbluth’s Gomez surely 



does us all a favor. But . 

But there is that w'ord 
“Great” in the title. 

“Great” is exactly what 
most of these stories are not. 
They have their merits — Tony 
Boucher’s taste does not allow 
him to sell us a single pup 
— but there is hardly an au- 
thor on the list who is rep- 
resented by his best story. 

Indeed, Boucher makes no 
very inflated claim in his in- 
troduction. “It is not a defini- 
tive anthology of the very best 
of all science fiction,” he says ; 
and, later: “My primary con- 
cern was simply to get to- 
gether a great deal of good 
reading in modern (1938- 
1958) s.f. which had been 
overlooked by earlier antholo- 
gists.” This relatively modest 
objective he has achieved very 
well ; but modesty stops at the 
title page. 

There is another considera- 
tion. Perhaps the very bulk of 
the enterprise forbids this de- 
gree of modesty. A net with 
as wide a maw as this (the 
book contains several hundred 
thousand words) should sure- 
ly have come up with a more 
brilliant catch, or at least a 
more varied one. Some very 
fine writers are included, of 

103 




course, but it seems somehow 
wrong that three writers are 
included in double strength 
while at least a score of oth- 
ers, equally good, are not rep- 
resented at all. 

As Boucher explains, it was 
his intention to avoid stories 
which had appeared in previ- 
ous science-fiction anthologies. 
Here his success depends on 
an exceedingly narrow con- 
struction of all parts of the 
term. Stories from antholo- 
gies are permitted if they 
were not entirely science- 
fiction anthologies (E.g., Ju- 
dith Merrirs Dead Center, 
previously on view in a Mar- 
tha Foley volume) and stories 
from science-fiction collections 
are allowed if they are not 
'‘anthologies.'' That is, in the 
usage of the trade, if they are 
collections of stories by a sin- 
gle writer. This furnishes a 
loophole for including, among 
many, Arthur C. Clarke's The 
Other Side of the Sky (ap- 
pearing just now as the title 
story of his newly reprinted 
collection, discussed elsewhere 
in this issue.) Boucher tells 
us that nine of the twenty- 
four stories have never ap- 
peared before in book form. 
But the other side of the coin 
is that fifteen of them have. 
And if a formula could be 
found to permit including 
them, surely it could have 
been stretched to allow an 
Asimov, a Blish, a Leiber, a 
Simak, a del Key, even — why 
not? — a Boucher ... to in- 



clude, that is, enough truly 
great stories by truly great 
science-fiction writers to jus- 
tify the size and the title. 

A Treasury of Great Sci- 
ence Fiction comes in two fat 
volumes, designed and well 
and truly timed for the Christ- 
mas trade. It is a massive dose 
of enjoyable science fiction — 
it is like having half a dozen 
issues of your favorite maga- 
zine to read all at once — and it 
will make a handsome pack- 
age under almost anyone’s 
tree. 

That isn't anything like 
what the title promises; but 
it's not bad at all ! 

A ce has reissued Jules 
Verne's Journey to the 
Center of the Earth and H. G. 
Wells's When the Sleeper 
Wakes, Wells reminds us that 
when a man of great literary 
talent tackles a science- fiction 
theme the result is very fine 
indeed. Verne does no such 
thing. Verne's talents were 
not literary; his characters 
are knotty pine; his touches 
of background description 
float immiscibly on the stream 
of the story, like the grena- 
dine in a pousse-cafe. But 
Verne showed a way. The 
special merit of Jules Verne 
as a writer of science-fiction 
stories is not that he wrote 
them well but that he wrote 
them at all, at a time when 
almost no one else had the wit 
to see that the thing could be 
done.

Kurt Siodmak is also a pi- 
oneer of science fiction, in a 
way, but he happens to be still 
with us, still vigorously pro- 
ducing stories. His latest is 
Skyport (Crown), which deals 
with the construction of a 
great, luxury space-hotel, or- 
biting Earth for the pleasure 
of the wealthy. It does not 
contain many surprises. Siod- 
mak, as a writer and director, 
has been able to convert many 
of his science-fiction stories 
into films. Skyport — flashy, 
fast and superficial — ^might 
make a good film, but it does 
not make a ve^ good book. 

Murray Leinster occupies 
both ends of an Ace double 
volume by himself. The Pi- 
rates of Zan on one hand. The 
Mutant Weapon on the other. 
It would not seem possible 
that after thirty years of 
space-pirate stories any writ- 
er could make one come alive ; 
but Bron Hoddan is a rather 
unique space pirate, and Mur- 
ray Leinster is a nearly 
unique science-fiction writer. 
Hoddan is, as the blurb on the 
jacket tells us, “The Deadliest 
Do-Gooder in All Space,” and 
for once a jacket blurb is en- 
tirely reliable. He is all of 
that . The Mutant Weapon 
in its previous appearances 
was, much more intelligibly, 
entitled Med Service. It has to 
do with a solitary, public- 
health sort of individual who 
takes care of plagues through- 
out the Galaxy. Any kind of 
plagues. He gets into some 



amazing jams, and Leinster 
almost never falters. He does 
not falter here. 

Rocket to Limbo (Ace) con- 
cerns a quest for aliens; the 
author is Alan E. Nourse. Oc- 
cupying the same binding is 
John Brunner’s Echo in the 
Skull, in which the aliens 
come to Earth and possess 
humans by limpeting to their 
backs and infiltrating their 
nervous systems. Whichever 
end you start from this is an 
entertaining volume, if not a 
very memorable one ... The 
Other Side of the Sky is not 
only a piece in the Boucher 
collection, but also the title 
piece of a collection of Arthui' 
C. Clarke’s own work. It is a 
solid evening’s reading, and 
perhaps the last all-Clarke for 
a while. Says Clarke in a foot- 
note: “All my shorter works 
of fiction that I think wortli 
preserving are now in volume 
form.” Well, the man will just 
have to get busy and write 
some more. 

A COUPLE of very belated 
gift suggestions for 
Christmas might be in order. 
Young readers will enjoy Dar- 
lene Geis’s Dinosaurs. Mrs. 
(ieis not only gives the ap- 
propriate facts about every- 
thing from trilobites to early 
mammals, but she insures the 
attention of her young au- 
dience by remembering, for 
example, that the first disin- 
terred icthyosaur was found 
by a twelve-year-old girl 



105 




named Mary Anning. Even 
adults will find enough of 
interest in this book to keep 
them going if, for instance, 
they find themselves required 
to read it to pre-schoolers. For 
example, Mrs. Geis mentions, 
and demolishes, the popular 
theories of why the dinosaurs 
became extinct. (1, the Earth 
became too dry ; but what 
about the deep-sea forms that 
perished at the same time? 2, 
small mammals ate their 
eggs ; but what about the fact 
that many species of live- 
bearers also became extinct?) 
The pictures are of course 
beautiful. We expect that in 
children’s books, but these, by 
R. F. Peterson, are not only 
colorful but exact. 

Older children are prime 
prospects for Looking at the 
Stars (Phoenix), a British 
import designed for the pre- 
primary class of starwatch- 
ers. Michael W. Ovenden, its 
author, does not assume you 
have already ground your first 
dozen mirrors. He tells you 
how to find Cassiopeia from 
the North Star, he tells you 
how to find the North Star 
from the Big Dipper, and he 
even tells you how to find the 
Big Dipper. (As he is British 
he calls it the Plough, but the 
illustrations make his mean- 
ing perfectly clear and, any- 
way, he uniformly gives scien- 
tific as well as popular names 
so there may be no mistake.) 
Ovenden does not quite go so 
far as to tell you to be sure to 



look up, not down, in order 
to find stars in the first place ; 
but he leaves very little else 
to prior information ; and 
thus this book is an admirable 
primer for beginners, teen- 
agers and roughly five out of 
six would-be science-fiction 
writers. 

Two other new science 
books for teen-agers are less 
successful. They are by Abra- 
ham and Rebecca B. Marcus, 
a couple who teach science in 
the New York City high 
schools; and the mark of the 
teacher lies heavy on their ex- 
pository style. Everything is 
in order, everything is exact. 
The romance is left out. 

In Tomorrow the Moon! 
(Prentice Hall) we once again 
tread the familiar path from 
Hero of Alexandria’s steam 
jet to space ships. In Potver 
Unlimited! we have the same 
treatment applied to the his- 
tory of man’s endeavor to 
muscle up his own feeble 
limbs through, successively, 
animals, slaves, water, fossil 
fuels, sunpower and nuclear 
sources. 

Both books are satisfactory 
texts but not too much in the 
way of entertainment. Potver 
Unlimited!, what’s more, 
shows a couple of eccentrici- 
ties worth mentioning. For 
some reason or other it is 
printed throughout in blue 
ink. There are optically better 
combinations than black-on- 
white, but blue-on-white is not 
one of them. Again, the back 



106 




jacket asks: "Do you know 
the difference between a rock- 
et and a jet?'' It shows two 
diagrams, labeled "Rocket or 
jet . which is which?'', and 
promises : “You ivill know 
the difference when you finish 
Power Unlimited," Well, it 
seems that somebody didn^t 
finish. Both diagrams are of 
rockets. 

For adults the problem of 
selection is only more difficult 
because there is so much more 
to select from. Readers of this 
column will not have failed to 
realize that there has been an 
ample supply of first-rate 
books this year. A non-book 
gift for almost anyone, 
science-fiction reader or not, 
might be one or more of the 
splendid astronomical photo- 
graphs issued by Astro- 
Murals. These are large (2x3 
feet) and almost overpower- 
ingly beautiful; they include 
several views of the moon, five 
separate nebulae, a study of 
Saturn complete with rings 
and a solar prominence. It is 
hard to imagine anyone who 
wouldn't be delighted by a 
sampling of these; if such a 
dullard exists, why do you 
want to give him a present 
anyway? 

T urning finally to some 
non-fiction titles, in Soap- 
Bubbles (Dover), C. V. Boys 
tells us all there is to tell 
about bubbles, surface ten- 
sion, the behavior of droplets 
of liquids in other liquids, etc. 



If you think this is a modest 
aim for a 160-page book, pro- 
fusely illustrated with photos 
and step-by-step diagrams, it 
is clear that your acquaint- 
ance with bubble-blowing is 
limited to the transitory 
spherical kind that come 
whipping out of a bent wire 
frame. An evening with Boys 
will set you straight. The book 
is a classic, not revised since 
1911; but a new preface by 
S. Z. Lewin brings the quaint- 
er terms up to date and sup- 
plies an expert's perspective 
where it is needed. 

What Boys did half a cen- 
tury ago for soap-bubbles, 
H. H. Nininger has just now 
done for meteorites. The book 
is Out of the Sky, and the 
publisher again is Dover. 
Here are records and eye-wit- 
ness accounts of the most re- 
markable recent meteorite 
falls, supplemented with a dis- 
cussion of the fascinating 
unanswered questions of the 
field (sample: Why does the 
sound of a meteorite's fall 
sometimes seem to reach an 
observer fifty miles away as 
fast as the light itself?), and 
rounded out with suggestions 
on what to look for on the off- 
chance that there might be a 
major fall near you. After all, 
meteorites are not so obliging 
as to fall on astronomical ob- 
servatories alone. Nearly all 
of what we know of the great 
falls comes from casual ob- 
servers, always untrained and 
sometimes inept; and a few 



107 




thousand copies of this book 
in circulation might well help 
preserve some priceless data 
from a future fall. 

Dover has also just publish- 
ed Sex in Psycho-Analysis and 
the Development of Psycho- 
Analysis by Sandor Ferenczi 
and Otto Rank, Beyond Psy- 
chology by Otto Rank and 
Folkivays by William Graham 
Sumner. As with nearly all 
the Dover titles, each book is 
of great importance in its 
special field, and the Sumner 
volume, forming as it does the 
strongest connective tissue be- 
tween the disciplines of an- 
thropology and sociology, is 
virtually unique. 

A BOOK for specialists — but 
one which those who want 
it will want very much indeed 
— is A Handbook of Science 
Fiction and Fantasy, compiled 
by Donald H. Tuck of Hobart, 
Tasmania, and published by 
himself. It is, says the title 
page, “A collection of material 
acting as a bibliographic sur- 
vey to the fields of science 
fiction and fantasy (including 
weird), covering the maga- 
zines, books, pocket books, 
personalities, etc., of these 
fields up to December, 1957.” 
This is clearly a labor of love. 
Really a sort of encyclopedia 
of the field, it is a valuable 
job of work. END

GRAVY TRAIN 



Ever hear of evil fairies who grant three 
wishes? McWorther’s was more efficient. 
One wish was plenty to bring catastrophe! 






By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



I planned well for retirement. 

His idyllic estate consisted of 

A t one hundred and thirty, a second-hand planetoid, thirty 
life was indeed gratifying miles in circumference, which 
for Titus McWorther. But for was the only habitable piece 
one missing detail, it would of matter in its system. Com- 
have been perfect. plete with supplementary 

With his wife, Edna, he had gravity generator, a compact 



111 



atmosphere, a mantle of lush 
topsoil and a carefully selected 
biota, McWorther's World was 
both his delight and his pride. 

Its principal asset was, of 
course, its isolation. 

Well away from the main- 
stream of galactic civilization, 
McWorther's Star was smugly 
hidden behind a dark nebula, 
through which he and Edna 
plunged twice a year to the 
fringe of the cluster — just to 
observe and mock convention, 
if for nothing else. 

It was an ideal setup. 

But, after two sedentary 
years, Titus realized he still 
needed one item to make his 
retirement complete. So he 
dispatched this tight-beamed 
message to the packet order 
department of Rear-Sobucks 
and Company in the West 
Cluster Federation's Hub 
City: 

Dear Sir: 

Please send one auto- 
matic bather with back- 
scrubbing attachment and 
toy boat docks, as listed in 
your videolog under order 
No. 4678-25C. Charge same 
to credit account No. 
W414754-B24D. 

Sincerely yours, 
Titus McWorther, Potentate 
McWorther's World 

He listed the coordinates of 
the star and the orbital factor 
of his planetoid. 

Unfortunately, the hyper- 



spatial line between McWorth- 
er's World and the nearest 
relay center was partly coinci- 
dent with the link to the po- 
litically noncommitted world 
of Gauyuth-VI. 

This condition, together 
with the fact that components 
of a communication are sent 
by separate pulse, sometimes 
leads to the embarrassing phe- 
nomenon known as “message 
interfusion," which is retrans- 
mission of the right text with 
the wrong signature. 

And it so happened that as 
Titus McWorther's order was 
en route, the system was also 
being burdened with this intel- 
gence to the Ganymede Exten- 
sion of the Western Clustei*’s 
State Department: 

Dear Sir: 

This will verify our 
agreement and authorize 
implementation of inter- 
stellar aid arrangements as 
set forth in conferences 
with your ambassador. If 
such arrangements produce 
mutual satisfaction, we will 
quite readily declare con- 
currence, in principle at 
least, with the political 
aims of the Western Cluster. 

Respectfully yours, 
Ogarm Netath, 
Prime Minister 
Gauyuth-VI 

Appended to the signatui-e 
were the coordinates of Gau- 
yuth and the orbital factor of 
its Number Six planet.

W HARTON HOVERLY, 
undersecretary of cosmic 
aid for the Western Cluster, 
plucked at his thick, gray 
mustache as he reread the 
space-o-gram. 

He punched the videobox 
stud. “Mallston !” 

The younger and more com- 
posed face of his assistant 
stared from the screen. “Yes, 
sir?” 

“Anything yet?” 

“Not a thing. We have no 
I’ecord of a — McWorther’s 
World.” 

“What do you suppose?” 
“Well, it seems authentic 
enough. We do know Ambas- 
sador Summerson has been 
working in that general area.” 
“And you think Summerson 
signed an aid agreement with 
this potentate?” 

“I’d say the message speaks 
for itself.” 

Again, Hoverly worried his 
mustache. “Did you check 
with Summerson ?” 

“He’s on extended leave.” 
“What do you think we 
ought to do?” 

“McWorther’s World must 
be a critical area. And evident- 
ly we’re going to get what we 
want out of the deal, since the 
Potentate speaks of concur- 
rence with Western Cluster 
aims.” 

Impatiently, the undersec- 
retary glanced out the win- 
dow. Ganymede was well out 
of the Jovian umbra now. If 
he didn’t leave soon, he’d be 
late for his conference with 



the commerce department on 
Farside Luna. 

“All right, Mallston,” he 
said. “Put McWorther’s World 
on a Class A aid schedule. 
That ought to hold the Poten- 
tate until Summerson gets 
back.” 

In the commercial section of 
Hub City, Rear-Sobucks and 
Company occupied a mon- 
strous building whose emblem- 
atic tip pierced the clouds. 

On the two hundredth floor, 
the twenty-seventh vice-presi- 
dent strode through the rail 
gate, tossed the secretary a 
“don’t - bother - to - announce - 
me” glance and went on into 
the inner office of the twenty- 
sixth vice-president. 

“Got something I thought 
you’d be interested in, V.R.,” 
he told the limp-faced man be- 
hind the desk. “There may be 
a promotion angle.” 

“What is it?” V.R. asked, 
not exactly gripping his chair 
with anticipation. 

The other placed the space- 
o-gram on the desk. “It’s from 
an Ogarm Netath, prime min- 
ister of a place called Gau- 
yuth-Six. He wants an auto- 
matic bather.” 

V.R. extended a “so what?” 
glare. 

“Don’t you see? Big shots 
like that don’t place personal 
orders. But here’s one who 
thinks so much of a Rear- 
Sobucks item that he forgets 
all about convention.” 

“And so, Wheeler, you want 

113 



GRAVY TRAIN 




to capitalize on his good name 
in some sort of promotion gim- 
mick,” V.R. said through taut 
lips. 

Wheeler shrank. “But I 
thought—” 

“Never mind what you 
thought. Fill his order. Send it 
compliments of — let’s see, 
Gauyuth-Six is uncommitted 
— compliments of the Western 
Cluster.” 

I T WAS a fine morning on 
McWorther’s World. Cot- 
ton-candy clouds floated over 
the fields. Dreaming herons, 
balanced on slender legs, gave 
the shallows of the lake a tuft- 
ed appearance. A delightful 
breeze, artificially generated 
at the equator, wafted flower- 
ing stalks and rocked the air 
car and spaceabout at their 
moorings. 

Titus snorted on the ve- 
randa and reached for his 
julep. He was a chunky little 
man, with the ruddiness of 
good health tinting his face 
and overflowing onto his part- 
ly bald pate. 

“Where are you, Titus?” an 
anxious voice disturbed the 
quiet of the house. 

“Out here, Love.” 

Edna appeared in the door- 
way. Despite her age, there 
was still the fascination in her 
timeless eyes that had snared 
Titus more than ninety years 
ago. 

“The chef burned the beans 
again,” she said, frowning. 
“Cuess ril have to fix it.” 



“You know it’s not the cook- 
er. It’s that darned gravity.” 

He realized now it was a 
weight fluctuation that had 
nudged him from his nap. 

“I’ve got it set that way, 
Love,” he explained. “We did 
not get clouds in the contract. 
But by varying the gravity 
control we can have them for 
nothing. It all has to do with 
atmospheric pressure.” 

Edna cast a resigned glance 
skyward. “If that’s the way 
you want it — fleecy clouds and 
burnt beans — ” 

The guttural scream of 
braking jets rattled the win- 
dows and sent the herons 
winging for the safety of the 
other hemisphere. Hesitating 
on the fringe of the atmos- 
phere, the freighter altered its 
approach and landed beside 
the house. 

Titus went out to meet the 
skipper and his three assist- 
ants whose arms were filled 
with printed forms. 

“You Potentate McWorth- 
er?” the skipper asked. 

Titus smiled in embarrass- 
ment. “It’s a gag. I just call 
myself that.” 

“We got your order,” the 
other snapped. “Where do you 
want it?” 

Titus’ small eyes widened 
with an inner vision of the 
automatic bather — a vision 
which went on in speculation 
to dispose of the crude show- 
er-masseur, for which he and 
Edna were getting a bit too 
old. 



114 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




“If you’ll put it on the ver- 
anda — ” He paused and shout- 
ed back toward the house. 
“Edna, get out the grapplers. 
We’re in business.” 

“Fun-ny,” the skipper ob- 
served with dry derision. Then 
he signaled to his waiting 
assistants. 

They came forward and, 
one by one, thrust their stacks 
of printed forms against 
TOus’ chest. His arms came up 
in a reflex to accept the offer- 
ings, But, as the third assist- 
ant’s contribution sent the 
stack soaring in front of his 
face, he went down under the 
weight. 

When he had extricated 
himself from the mound of 
paper, the men had returned 
to their ship. And now its 
sides were folding down and 
scores of huge crates were 
drifting out on repulsor 
beams and fluttering to the 
ground. 

Soon the freighter was gone 
and Edna was at his side. 

“What have you gotten us 
into now, Titus?” 

“Honest, Love — I don’t 
know.” 

Suddenly his ears were split- 
ting with the thunderous roar 
of a thousand ships plunging 
down to the surface as far as 
he could see around the per- 
imeter of his small world. 
Each pulled to a halt a few 
feet from the ground, opened 
its sides and disgorged vast 
mounds of crates and sacks, 
boxes and barrels, naked hills 

GRAVY TRAIN 



of coarse material that hissed 
like gravel as it spewed from 
chut^ gleaming masses of 
machinery. 

Confounded, Titus seized 
one of the slips of paper. It 
was an invoice listing two 
hundred earth movers, sev- 
enty-five instant pavers, five 
hundred concrete mixers. 

Matching his frown, Edna 
read a second sheet and de- 
manded, “What on earth do 
you expect to do with a hun- 
dred thousand barrels of 
wheat germ oil? Four thou- 
sand kegs of eight-penny 
nails? Forty-five hundred tons 
of soybeans?” 

A t HIS secluded villa. Prime 
Minister Netath was en- 
tertaining his foreign min- 
ister, Ugaza Bataul. 

Netath leaned against the 
terrace bar and proposed a 
toast. “To an era of plenty.” 
Bataul smiled. “At the ex- 
pense of the Western Clus- 
ter.” 

They gulped the drinks and 
Netath stared down into his 
empty glass. “We’re quite for- 
tunate that the Western Clus- 
ter’s aspirations are extend- 
ing to this sector.” 

“As long as we can be sure 
that there won’t be any mili- 
tary advances.” Bataul added 
the qualification with misgiv- 
ing. 

“Oh, there’s no danger of 
that. Actually, we’re lucky we 
didn’t try to get on the East- 
ern Cluster’s gravy train. 

115 




We’d have had to make a lot of 
concessions.” 

Heralding its own approach 
with a sputtering rumble, the 
station ’copter came in low 
over the trees and dropped 
down on the lawn. Netath 
walked over as his chauffeur 
climbed out of the cab and 
used antigrav grapples to float 
a large crate out of the freight 
compartment. 

“Just picked it up at the 
space terminal,” the man ex- 
plained. “Must be that aid 
shipment.” 

Bataul laughed. “You mean 
the first batch of credit cer- 
tificates, maybe.” 

The chauffeur pressed the 
“unpack” stud. The sides of 
the crate fell outward. 

“What is it?” Netath drew 
back, surveying the ivory, 
tanklike thing with its spar- 
kling fixtures and flexible ap- 
pendages. 

Bataul bent and read the 
words on the inscription 
plate: “Deluxe Automatic 

Bather— 4678-25C.” 

By then, Netath had found 
the torn, soiled delivery tag. 
He read the part of the writ- 
ing that was still legible : 

. sincerely hope this ex- 
pression of Western amity 
meets with your satisfaction. 
If we can serve you again, 
please don’t hesitate . .” 

Infuriated, he imparted a 
vindictive kick to the crate 
and crumpled the paper. 



“That’s the cosmic aid we 
were expecting?” Bataul sput- 
tered. 

“Capitalist Western dogs!” 
Netath exclaimed. “They were 
just trifling with our plan- 
etary honor!” 

“It’s an insult against our 
racial character!” the foreign 
minister said severely, “They 
know we have no use for a 
bather, shedding our skin as 
we do once a day.” 

Netath forced restraint into 
his features. “We will not lose 
our diplomatic poise. There is 
always the chance a mistake 
has been made.” 

He drew the contacter out 
of his pocket and shouted into 
its grid, “Miss Yalera?” 

“Yes, sir?” came the instant 
answer. 

“Take a space-o-gram to 
Solaria.” 

II 

W HEN the initial error 
was made at the hyper- 
spatial relay station, a pattern 
had been set. Committed cate- 
gorically to the memory banks 
were the false associations be- 
tween the State Department’s 
Ganymede Extension and Po- 
tentate McWorther, between 
Premier Netath and Rear-So- 
bucks. 

Thus, it was somewhat to 
be expected that Undersecre- 
tary Hoverly should find him- 
self chewing on the under- 
bristles of his mustache as he 
read the lastest space-o-gram.

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




Dear Sir: 

Needless to say, we are 
somewhat disappointed 
over the Western Cluster’s 
meager response to our des- 
perate need. 

Perhaps Ambassador 
Summerson misrepresented 
our agreement. In that 
event, we feel sure that 
consultation with his Ex- 
cellency wn‘11 set the record 
straight. 

We would appreciate 
prompt attention to this de- 
tail. Otherwise, in the in- 
terest of our people, we 
shall feel compelled to seek 
satisfaction elsewhere. 

Respectfully yours, 
Titus McWorther, 
Potentate 

Hoverly tossed the message 
on his desk, punched the audio- 
corn button and called for his 
assistant. When Mallston ar- 
rived, the undersecretary was 
still pacing, 

“Did you take care of the 
McWorther World aid con- 
signment?’' he asked. 

Mallston nodded. “Delivery 
should have been made day be- 
fore yesterday. Full Class A 
schedule." 

“Well, it w^asn't enough!" 
Hoverly extended a stiff finger 
toward the space - o - gram. 
“Read that." 

Looking up finally, Mallston 
said, “Evidently we dropped 
the ball." 

“Indeed we did. Ambassa- 
dor Summerson must have 



promised the Potentate the 
whole works." 

Hoverly resumed pacing. “I 
should have guessed as much. 
President Roswell only last 
week hinted that the Western 
Cluster should level its galac- 
tic commerce sights on that 
entire sector." 

Mallston pondered the grav- 
ity of the space-o-gram. “May- 
be we should lay the McWorth- 
er development before the 
President." 

Bristling, the undersecre- 
tary said, “And call attention 
to our own incompetence? 
We'll straight this matter out 
by doing what we should have 
done in the first place — by 
putting the Potentate on the 
double-A priority list. Full 
and immediate delivery under 
Class B til rough K schedules.” 

Mallston started out, but 
paused at the door. “How 
about cultural exchange?" 

“We'll play it safe by as- 
suming Summerson shot the 
works in that category too. 
Round up every uncommitted 
cultural group in the cluster." 

S HAKING his head depre- 
catingly, the twenty-sev- 
enth vice-president stood be- 
fore the desk of the next high- 
est official in the Rear-Sobucks 
hierarchy. 

“Well, Wheeler,” V.R. clip- 
ped without looking up. “What 
is it this time?” 

“I'm afraid Netath didn't 
take too kindly to our ges- 
ture.” 



GRAVY TRAIN 



117 




“Netath? Netath?” V.R. 
milked the name for its sig- 
nificance.” 

“Ogarm Netath. The prime 
minister of that Gauyuth 
place. The automatic bather.” 
“Oh, that one.” 

Wheeler handed over the 
space-o-gram and V.R. mut- 
tered through the message : 

Dear Sir: 

I’m sure you made a mis- 
take filling my order. 
You’ve got to come pick up 
your shipment right away. 
We’re up to our ears and 
it’s shaking us to pieces. 

Yours in disappointment, 
Ogarm Netath, 
Prime Minister 

Growling, V.R. dropped an 
effervescent pill into a glass of 
water. “You can’t get any- 
where with these back-planet 
bumpkins. I doubt that this 
Netath ever had a bath. Send 
him a Supplementary Manual 
of Operating Instructions.” 
Wheeler started for the 
door. 

But V.R. called after him. 
“And bill the prime minister 
for that article. It’ll teach him 
to show a little bit of appre- 
ciation.” 

T itus winced before the 
persistent tremors that 
came through the floor of his 
cellar. He made another ad- 
justment on the gravity con- 
trol deflecting the planetoid’s 
center of pseudomass another 



few feet. The ground beneath 
him finally quieted. 

“Three days,” he mumbled, 
dragging himself up the stairs. 

Edna received him with 
hands on hips. “Three days — 
what?” 

“Getting things balanced 
again.” 

“What are you going to do 
about all that stuff cluttering 
up our beautiful planetoid?” 
She was near tears. 

With Edna dogging his 
steps, he returned to the ve- 
randa, where his julep was 
now quite thin and warm in 
the rays of the setting sun. 

“We’ll have to find out 
where it came from first,” he 
said, staring dismally over the 
mountains of machinery and 
grain, the tumbled stacks of 
crates and barrels and kegs, 
the lesser rows of wheeled 
and winged vehicles. 

“Seems to me,” Edna per- 
sisted, “that the invoices will 
show that.” She gestured at 
what remained of the stacks of 
printed forms. 

The rest of the slips were 
strewn over the ground as far 
as he could see. “Only the first 
sheet will show the origin — if 
we could ever find it,” Titus 
explained. 

He went out to the air car, 
warmed it up and sent it 
churning skyward. Near the 
attenuated top of the atmos- 
phere, he was able to see ex- 
actly how much extraneous 
stuff had been dumped on his 
world. The main area of dis- 



118 



DANIEL , F. GALOUYE 




posal seemed to have been 
within a two-mile radius of 
the house. 

An ever-widening helical 
course, wending its way alter- 
nately from night to day, 
eventually brought him on a 
great circle that sliced over 
both poles. Then, with his 
searchlights still burning, he 
spiraled inward, covering the 
other hemisphere. The rest of 
his world was in primal order. 

He started for home around 
the daylight side. 

But even above the noise of 
his own rotor jets, the stri- 
dence of descending freighters 
erupted in a pandemonium of 
sound all around him. Great 
clouds of rockets, clustered in 
fleets, were darkening the sky 
and raining down onto the sur- 
face. 

He barely managed to pull 
out from under one of the 
foiTnations before it could 
pinch him against the ground. 
Swearing in oaths that he had 
not used in years, he headed 
for the nearest group of ships. 
Before he could close in, they 
had discharged their cargoes 
and thundered off into space 
again. 

He altered course for an- 
other detachment of freight- 
ers, only to meet with the same 
frustrating results. By the 
time he had aimed his craft at 
a third group, all the ships had 
blasted away, leaving every- 
where great, gleaming mounds 
and stacks and irregular rows 
of crates and containers that 

GRAVY TRAIN 



completely obscured the sur- 
face. 

Enraged, Titus gunned the 
craft for home. He picked his 
way between several mon- 
strous peaks of grain, some of 
them soaring nearly all the 
way up through the six-hun- 
dred - foot - thick atmosphere, 
and threw on his brakes to 
avoid collision with a tremen- 
dous pyramid of what looked 
like corn kernels. 

With stark apprehension, 
he envisioned his world shak- 
ing apart under the eccentric 
forces. But he quelled his 
fears with logic : This new ad- 
dition of mass, apparently dis- 
tributed evenly over all but 
the four square miles that had 
already served as a dumping 
ground, would be unbalanced 
only to a negligible degree. 

T itus flicked on his landing 
lights as he headed into the 
night. But from over the hori- 
zon came a glare considerably 
stronger than the candlepower 
of his own electrical system. 
As he pulled up to the moor- 
ing pylon, the explanation was 
evident. 

Scores of Pullman crafts 
were packed so tightly around 
his house that the blunt noses 
of several were sticking out 
over the veranda. 

He cut off the idling jets. 
The militant strains of a Ve- 
nurian march, blaring from 
the instruments of a hundred- 
piece symphony, swelled up 
mightily all around him. The 

119 




orchestra itself was wedged 
between two residential crafts 
while the roof of McWorther's 
generating house served as the 
conductor’s podium. 

On the veranda, a full 
troupe of Simalean Ballet 
dancers swirled and caracoled, 
not seeming to mind that they 
were occasionally overflowing 
the tiles and flouncing not so 
lightly through Edna’s cala- 
diums. 

His wife stood helplessly by, 
still gripping the autobroom 
which she had evidently 
wielded without success in an 
attempt to rout the intruders. 

Dismayed, Titus elbowed 
his way through a dedicated 
choral group that was patri- 
otically rendering the “Fayo- 
thian Anthem,” sidestepped a 
tumbling foursome obviously 
from one of the Lesser Javapa 
planets and pushed aside a de- 
bating team which was having 
little luck making itself heard 
above the general cacophony. 

Edna swept out to meet 
him. “Titus, they just won’t 
leave !” 

“Who are they? What do 
they want?” 

“I don’t know.” She was 
having a difficult time re- 
straining herself. “They asked 
for the ministry of something 
or other. Then they said they 
were cooped up so long that 
they had to get some prac- 
tice.” 

Titus bellowed for atten- 
tion. But nobody turned an 
ear, except a pirouetting bal- 

120 



lerina who whirled to a stop 
nearby, glissaded over in 
front of him and made a the- 
atrical display of bending over 
and planting a set of lip-prints 
on his forehead — a gesture 
that fed considerable fuel to 
Edna’s vexation. 

“You’re cute,” the dancer 
tittered. “You got the woi’d 
on this place. Pudgy? What is 
it — a stopover station?” 

Before he could answer, one 
of the tumblers shouted, “It’s 
snowing!” 

The choral group broke rev- 
erently into the ancient carol 
“Noel” while the orchestra 
paused on an upbeat and 
swung into a jazzed-up “Jin- 
gle Bells.” 

Perplexed, Titus stared at 
the dancing snowflakes. But 
that was impossible! It never 
snowed here on McWorther’s 
World! 

Then he remembered the 
grain peak he had skirted on 
the way home. It had extended 
high above the infrared and 
ultraviolet shields — into the 
naked, hot zone where restless 
winds had wafted the kernels 
eastward. 

He picked up one of the 
“flakes.” 

Popcorn! 

Ill 

M any light years away, the 
Emperor of the Eastern 
Cluster whirled around, kick- 
ed his be jeweled train out of 
the way and faced his chief 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




adviser. “So they’ve opened 
up a new aid offensive?” 

“And a most vital one.” The 
adviser blew on his spectacles 
and burnished the lenses 
against his sleeve. “A place 
called McWorther. Our intelli- 
gence got its coordinates from 
their consignment documents.” 
“Never heard of it.” 

“That’s what’s so insidious 
about this whole capitalist 
plot. They’ve kept it under 
their hats.” 

“And why is it so vital?” 
The adviser directed the 
Emperor’s attention to a space 
globe suspended from the ceil- 
ing. He pressed two buttons 
on the wall and twin beams of 
light intersected within the 
sphere. “That’s McWorther’s 
location.” 

“Why — why — ” the Emper- 
or stammered. “That outflanks 
us completely!” 

“What concerns me is how 
many other undisclosed but 
settled worlds lie in that same 
general area.” 

“A whole raft of them, no 
doubt,” the Emperor said pes- 
simistically. 

“What are we going to do ?” 
“In this critical sector 
we’ve got to make friends — 
and fast! We’ll begin with the 
McWorther place.” 

“How far do you want to 
go?” 

“All the way. Empty the 
surplus bins. Clear out the 
warehouses. Let McWorther 
have every available pound 
of material and equipment.” 

GRAVY TRAIN 



“Terms?” 

“Terms be damned! We let 
the Western Cluster steal a 
march on us. We’ve got to re- 
coup. Everything goes as an 
outright gift — with all the cul- 
tural trimmings thrown in.” 

T itus splashed into the cel- 
lar and struck out for the 
hypertransmitter. 

It was a peculiar flood. Suf- 
fusing the water was a thick 
scum that flashed iridescently 
as it caught the glint of light 
from the ceiling. He stuck his 
finger into the dross and ap- 
plied it to the tip of his tongue. 
Syrup ! 

He thought of the thousands 
of barrels that had been 
dumped into the lake and sui- 
mised that the contaminated 
water was backing up through 
the drainage system. 

He altered course for the 
pumps. 

And, like ships in convoy, a 
score of virtuosos invaded the 
cellar, paddling in his wake. 

The soprano’s piercing voice 
assailed his ears. “In all my 
theatrical experience, I have 
never been subjected to such 
indignity! I insist — ” 

But a violinist pushed for- 
ward, wielding his bow like a 
stiff finger. “You, sir, are 
holding back on us. No doubt 
you know what our future in- 
structions are.” 

“I’ve never seen such fascist 
highhandedness,” complained 
a diminutive choreographer in 
the uniform of a Palosov 

121 




Rocket Dancer. “In the name 
of the ministry of culture of 
the Eastern Federation, I de- 
mand to see a representative 
of His Imperial Highness!” 
Ignoring them, Titus trudg- 
ed on to the pumps and set 
them for maximum drain-off. 

The Simalean ballerina did 
a series of rapid turns and 
watched the spray and the 
pattern of ripples that issued 
from her darting feet. 

“Exquisite!” she exuberat- 
ed. “I shall have to speak with 
the maitre de ballet about a 
nymphal sequence!” 

“Come on, Pop.” One of the 
tumblers confronted Titus. 
“What’s the gimmick? Why 
are they keeping us loafing 
around here?” 

“Why?” roared a dramatist, 
allowing his voice full rein in 
the acoustic inadequacy of the 
cellar. “I’ll tell you : It’s a cap- 
italist scheme to abduct the 
top talent of the glorious 
workers’ federation!” 

Hands clamped over his 
ears, Titus finally made it to 
the hypertransmitter. He jig- 
gled its dials, beat on the cab- 
inet, lifted a foot from the 
water and gave it a couple of 
kicks broadside. 

No results. It was obviously 
shorted out from the flood. 
And none of the Pullman 
crafts was equipped with 
long - range communications 
gear. 

Titus waded from the cel- 
lar, plodded through the house, 
leaving pools of syrupy water 

122 



in his wake, and stalked onto 
the veranda. 

The scene was no less hectic 
than it had been. There were 
two orchestras now. And they 
were waging a war of decibels 
to determine whether the 
“East Cluster Blastoff March” 
or the “West Cluster Anthem” 
should prevail over McWorth- 
er’s World. 

Two debating teams were 
holding forth on the compara- 
tive benefits of proletarian 
solidarity and the free enter- 
prise system. Beyond the cala- 
dium bed, Edna, who seemed 
to have finally succumbed to 
frustrated abandon, had 
struck a face-to-the-sun and 
wind-in-her-hair posture for a 
portraitist who was drowning 
futility in artistic endeavor. 

But there was neither wind 
nor sun to accommodate the 
pose, Titus lamented. For, 
after yesterday’s deliveries by 
the bright red cargo ships, 
which had obviously been 
from the Eastern Cluster, 
there was little left of Mc- 
Worther’s World that could be 
recognized. 

The immediate area around 
the house had been spared in 
the deluge of material. But, 
beyond, great sloping expanses 
of grain and crates, barrels, 
boxes, machinery, bulging 
sacks and drums stretched up 
and away like the inner walls 
of a crater. 

Fortunately, disposal onto 
the surface of McWorther’s 
World had stopped. But not 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




delivery to the system. Corus- 
cating pinpoints of flame, far 
out in space, signified the 
presence of thousands upon 
thousands of cargo carriers 
that were dropping off their 
freight in solar orbit. The 
items of merchandise them- 
selves were indistinguishable. 
But their composite existence 
was beginning to take on the 
appearance of a great ring of 
fragmented particles stretch- 
ing around the sun. 

And Titus supposed that it 
was only the reliability of the 
mass-fending generators at- 
tached to each article that 
tentatively kept them all sepa- 
rate and prevented them from 
plunging like a devastating 
hailstorm onto the surface of 
his world. 

He slumped to the ground 
and bracketed his cheeks be- 
tween his palms. For some un- 
accountable reason, it seemed 
that the productivity of the 
entire universe was being 
showered down on his private 
planetoid in one vast gravy- 
train effect. 

Only he was drowning in 
the gravy. 

^^4ND that's my story.” 

^ Undersecretary of Cos- 
mic Aid Hoverly laid his 
hands on the conference table. 
“And we now have McWorth- 
er's World on a total aid 
schedule.” 

President Roswell, an an- 
gular man with a troubled 
face, drummed his fingertips 

GRAVY TRAIN 



together. “Gentlemen, this is 
most serious.” 

On his right, Ambassador 
Summerson's head bobbed in 
accord. The gesture spread 
next to the chief of intelli- 
gence, then to Hoverly, thus 
making the circuit back to 
Roswell. 

“To sum up, then,” said the 
President, “you, Hoverly, au- 
thorized aid for a McWorth- 
er's World in the 47-126 
area.” 

The undersecretary glanced 
away uneasily. 

“But you, Summerson,” 
Roswell continued, “have no 
record of having signed aid 
agreements with such a 
place.” 

“That's right,” the ambas- 
sador verified. “But deciding 
to accommodate McWorther's 
World was the most fantastic 
stroke of good luck imagin- 
able.” 

Hoverly squinted. “I don't 
follow you.” 

“When you sent aid to the 
Potentate, not only did you 
pick what will undoubtedly 
develop into the most critical 
political area of the millen- 
nium, but you also beat the 
Easties to the draw in a sector 
that they had staked out all 
for themselves.” 

“A stroke of sheer luck,” 
President Roswell concurred. 

The roving ambassador lean- 
ed back smiling. “The chance 
timing was perfect too. We 
beat them by less than two 
weeks.” 

123 




But the intelligence chief’s 
face was rigid with dejection. 
“We got their ‘firstest,’ to use 
an ancient expression, but not 
with the ‘mostest.’ Our agents 
in Imperial City report that 
the amount of aid authorized 
for McWorther’s World is un- 
believable. The entire Eastern 
Cluster is going on a full 
austerity basis to support the 
program.” 

“That shows what value 
they place on McWorther’s 
World and the sector it opens 
up,” Roswell offered. “When 
they found out we’d moved in 
ahead of them, their reaction 
was frantic.” 

Summerson rose. “This, 
then, gentlemen, is it.” 

“It certainly is.” Roswell’s 
voice was heavy with despond- 
ency. “The most God-awful 
aid war the cluster has ever 
seen.” 

“We can’t back out,” the 
ambassador warned. “We’ve 
got to get busy and face up 
to the task.” 

“With every resource at our 
disposal. To ignore the chal- 
lenge would be to surrender 
this entire section of the gal- 
axy to the Easties.” 

The President was silent a 
moment. “Gentlemen, I am 
Ixerewith sounding a call to 
economic anns. Cancel all 
other aid commitments and ac- 
tivity. Thi'ow everything we 
liave got, everything we can 
ever hope to produce, at Mc- 
Worther’s Word.” 

"I think you’d better call on 



the Potentate personally,” 
Summerson proposed. 

“That,” said Roswell, “is ex- 
actly what I intend to do.” 

A djusting the drape of 

his robe, the Emperor 
sent his eyes flicking over the 
report. Finally he lurched 
from his chair with a re- 
sounding “Em'eka!” 

“So you see how it is. Your 
Imperial Highness,” his chief 
adviser offered. “By cutting 
in on their McWorther World 
operation, we have indeed 
touched a sensitive Western 
spot.” 

“There’s no question about 
that,” the Emperor said lust- 
ily. He was a portly man 
whose sartorial excesses 
made him seem even more im- 
posing. His eyes, recessed un- 
der thickset brows, flared with 
triumph as he said, “Mc- 
Worther’s World must figure 
prominently in their planning. 
From the way they cut loose 
with everything they had 
when they found out we were 
stepping in too, damned if I’m 
not convinced this new system 
will be the pivotal point of 
their entire future strategy.” 
“Then we’d better order 
double production quotas on 
every world that flies the 
Eastern flag.” 

“Triple quotas. And have 
my space yacht refitted by to- 
morrow.” 

“You’re going somewhere, 
Highness?” asked the adviser. 
“This Potentate McWorther 



124 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




is likely to be the third most 
important political figure in 
the galaxy. I’m not going to 
lose any time getting over 
there and pumping his hand.” 

His face fluslied with rage, 
Ogarm Netath tossed the 
space-o-gram at his foreign 
minister, then snatched it 
back out of Bataul’s hands be- 
fore he had a chance to read 
it. 

“It’s a bill!” Netath’s voice 
quivered. “They sent us a bill 
for that damned bather mon- 
strosity !” 

Bataul’s brow, to all ap- 
pearances, was ready for 
spring planting. “Let me have 
another look at it.” 

Netath stood there trem- 
bling while the foreign min- 
ister sent his eyes darting 
over the paper. 

“It’s from Rear-Sobucks !” 
Bataul exclaimed. “A retail 
concern that obviously handles 
automatic bathei’s!” 

“But it was our aid ship- 
ment, wasn’t it?” 

“Apparently not. It says 
here, ‘. for merchandise 
previously extended in behalf 
of the Western Cluster . .’ ” 
“I don’t understand.” 
Bataul’s features struggled 
through a gamut of expres- 
sions. “I think I’m just begin- 
ning to. Do you remember last 
year when we had that com- 
munications survey made? Be- 
tween here and the nearest 
Western relay station, there 
was that single system. I 

GRAVY TRAIN 



think some crackpot had laid 
claim — of course. McWorth- 
er’s his name. Calls himself a 
potentate.” 

Netath stiffened. “And you 
think — ?” 

“I think both we and Mc- 
Worther are victims of mes- 
age interfusion,” Bataul said 
flatly. 

“And our aid shipments — ?" 

“I’d bet McWorther must 
be wringing his hands over 
more loot than he’ll ever be 
able to count.” 

Netath stai’ted punching 
buttons on his desk. “We’ve 
got work to do.” 

“What kind?” 

“First you’re going to get 
off a message to this Rear-So- 
bucks bunch and tell them 
what they can do with their 
bill and their automatic bath- 
er — if it’ll fit. You can also ex- 
plain what’s happened.” 

“This time we’ll send the 
message around the right leg 
of the cluster,” Bataul as- 
sured. 

“Then we’re hopping over 
to this McWorther system and 
laying down the law to that 
character. That I want to do 
personally.” 

“THIS,” said Twenty-Seventh 
Vice-President Wheeler of 
Rear-Sobucks, “explains it 
all.” 

“Communications interfu- 
sion?” the twenty-sixth vice- 
president asked. 

“Absolutely, V.R. Just like 
Premier Netath says.” 

125 




"Then there’s a Rear-So- 
bucks customer who has been 
unnecessarily inconvenienced 
and still hasn’t been satis- 
fied?” 

With a curt nod, Wheeler 
confirmed the other’s fear. 

V.R. rose from his desk and 
wagged a finger at the other. 
"I still don’t understand it all, 
Wheeler. But I can’t avoid the 
impression that you’re some- 
how responsible for the mess.” 

Wheeler cowered. 

“You’re going to take a trip 
—now !” V.R. went on, gather- 
ing steam. “You’re going to 
deliver a bather personally 
to this Potentate McWorther. 
You’re going to extend the 
apologies of the entire Rear- 
Sobucks organization !” 

IV 

T itus poured his tenth con- 
secutive julep — directly 
from the bottle, without the 
benefit of ice, sugar or mint — 
and leaned back in his chair. 
His occupancy of a comer of 
the veranda had been a hard- 
won concession. 

Almost indifferent now, he 
stared at the hundreds of vir- 
tuosos and shouted, “Go 
home!” 

But there was little zing in 
his voice and the words were, 
of course, lost in the confused 
sea of sound — musical, argu- 
mentative, operatic and other- 
wise. Heedless, the orchestras 
played, the ballet dancers 
whirled, painters sketched, 

126 



gymnasts tumbled, dramatists 
soliloquized and the vocalists 
made it plain that they would 
give no quarter, 

McWorther’s World shud- 
shuddered. And the towering 
peaks of machinery and grain, 
cases and crates rumbled omi- 
nously as their slopes shifted. 
Titus’ ears popped and he sud- 
denly felt a giddiness that was 
all out of proportion to the 
number of juleps he had con- 
sumed. 

An all-too-brief silence fell 
over the multitude. Then, as 
stability returned to the plan- 
etoid, they dived back into 
their various activities. 

They were damned fools, 
McWorther thought. Even if 
it meant risking their lives, 
they would be willing to stay 
there and consort in their 
Olympian ecstasy of artistic 
communion. It was a field day, 
old home week, esoteric an- 
schluss, a fraternal blowout 
— all rolled into one. 

A distant explosion rent 
what was left of the compact 
atmosphere. And, as an imme- 
diate consequence, additional 
hundreds of tons of grain 
hissed down a nearby slope 
and eased into the lake. 

^mewhat concerned, Titus 
stared at the myriad points of 
light coruscating deep out in 
space. What was happening 
was obvious : There were mil- 
lions, perhaps billions of ar- 
ticles of freight in the same 
orbit — all maintaining their 
distances from the planetoid 

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




and from one another by vir- 
tue of their mass-repulsion 
generators. And, where that 
many electronic units were 
concerned, the breakdown fac- 
tor became a predictable quan- 
tity. McWorther’s World could 
now expect to be the target of 
a plunging chunk of cargo 
once every four or five min- 
utes. 

Another few hours, Titus 
realized, and that interval 
would be reduced to four or 
five seconds. For he could 
readily see the infinite streams 
of freighters that were still 
arriving and dropping off ad- 
ditional cargo. 

As a matter of fact, it was 
so thick out there now that 
only a faint, diffused light was 
coming through from Mc- 
Worther’s Sun. 

Titus poured himself an- 
other mintless, sugarless, ice- 
less julep. 

T he insigne of the Western 
Cluster emblazoned on its 
side, a giant ship felt its way 
down through the atmosphere, 
sidled this way and that as it 
squeezed through the barrier 
of anchored Pullman crafts, 
pulled up and hovered over 
the southern edge of the ve- 
randa. 

At that particular moment, 
Titus had been quite fascinat- 
ed with the tumblers’ practice 
session. One of the gymnasts, 
preparing for a back-flip, had 
taken a boost from the cupped 
hands of another. Only the re- 

GRAVY TRAIN 



suiting arc through the air 
was executed with slow-mo- 
tion rhythm that took the per- 
former to a height of perhaps 
twenty feet before he floated 
back to the ground. 

At the same time, Titus’ 
ears popped again and he had 
the odd sensation that the deck 
chair was shrinking away be- 
neath him. 

The newly arrived ship low- 
ered an escalator to the sur- 
face and the pilot glided down, 
landing only a few feet from 
McWorther. 

“There seems to be some 
mistake,” . he said. “I was 
given these coordinates and 
orbital factor for a — ” he 
checked his notebook — “Mc- 
Worther’s World.” 

“This,” said Titus stiffly, “is 
McWorther’s World.” 

Cupping his hands, the pilot 
called back into the ship. 
“We’re on the right place.” 

An alarmed face poked out 
of the hatch. 

“This is it?” 

Titus lurched to his feet, 
returning an equally startled 
expression. The man coming 
down the escalator was Presi- 
dent Vance Roswell of the 
Western Federation! He had 
seen the face on thousands of 
newscasts. 

Roswell, sickened, stared at 
the mountains of supplies on 
the obscured surface of the 
planetoid. He tilted his head 
back and took in the glimmer- 
ing sea of cargo out in space, 
the flaring trails of exhaust 

127 




jets that criss-crossed in an 
infinite pattern as endless 
streams of ships jockeyed into 
position to discharge more 
freight. Then he dropped to 
the veranda railing and bur- 
ied his face hopelessly in his 
hands. 

By then, one of the orches- 
tra conductors, who had also 
recognized the President, had 
abruptly brought his baton 
down to terminate the '‘Ly- 
raen Overture.'' He led his en- 
semble into a stirring rendi- 
tion of the ''West Cluster An- 
them." 

Without interrupting his 
misery, Roswell elevated a 
limp hand and signaled for 
quiet. 

But even before the musi- 
cians tapered to silence on a 
jagged, perplexed note, the 
other orchestra blared forth 
with the "East Cluster Blast- 
off March," all its members 
standing and facing the north- 
ern edge of the veranda. 

Titus watched the impres- 
sive vessel float to the surface, 
its almost invisible repulsor 
beams jostling the lesser Pull- 
man ships out of its w^ay. 
Splashed across its side was 
the fist-clutching-galaxy sym- 
bol of the Eastern Federation. 

He was still gawking when 
the hatch opened, ushering 
onto the tiled surface none 
other than the Emperor him- 
self — an immense, brilliantly 
robed man who swept like a 
bowling ball through his reti- 
nue of aides. 



T here were two distant ex- 
plosions, one close on the 
heels of the other, and the 
planetoid convulsed. That 
time, Titus imagined, he had 
seen one of the masses of car- 
go plunging to the surface. 

The Emperor drew up be- 
fore Titus. But although his 
lips moved, no audible sound 
came from his mouth, since he 
was in the immediate range of 
the Eastern Symphony Or- 
chestra's bass section. 

Scowling, he whirled, threw 
up this arms and bellowed for 
silence. Quiet came as though 
someone had pulled a plug. 

"Now," he said, propping 
his fists on his hips and flaring 
his robe out even furthei-, 
"perhaps someone will en- 
lighten me. I’m looking for 
McWorther’s World. It’s sup- 
posed to be here." 

Titus poured a triple, undi- 
luted julep and gulped down 
half of it. He said, "You’re 
standing on it." 

" This ! That’s impossible ! 
What’s the population?" 

"Two — not counting the 
transients." Titus started to 
offer the Emperor the rest of 
his julep, thought better of it 
and drank it himself. 

Roswell withdrew from his 
dejection, looked up and nod- 
ded, verifying the Emperor’s 
stark suspicion. It was appar- 
ent that the President was 
only then aware of the Emper- 
or’s identity. And the latter 
was obviously no less surpris- 
ed on recognizing his counter- 



128 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




part from the Western Clus- 
ter. 

They only stared uncertain- 
ly at each other while the hun- 
dreds of virtuosos, sensing the 
propriety of demonstrating 
their loyalty, split into two 
groups and took sides behind 
their respective leaders. 

Roswell laughed finally. It 
was a high-pitched, unnatural 
sound that conveyed no glee at 
all and grew only more ragged 
as his shifting stare once 
again took in the completely 
ruined merchandise on the 
surface, the practically irre- 
trievable cargoes adrift in 
space. His pitiable outburst 
suggested an infinity of futil- 
ity over the wanton waste. It 
spoke wordlessly of sterility 
for hundreds of productive 
worlds over the years ahead — 
economic sterility, and its in- 
evitable consequence of mili- 
tary impotence. 

The Emperor watched him 
for a moment, then dropped 
to the veranda rail beside him. 
He didn’t join in the almost 
hysterical laughter. But his 
glum features refiected sym- 
pathetic appreciation of Ros- 
well’s predicament. And in 
his heavy silence was the 
admission that the circum- 
stances were mutual. 

McWorther’s World trem- 
bled again. Titus inclined his 
head to one side, jiggling a fin- 
ger in his ear to stop it from 
popping. He could have sworn, 
too, that he had seen the Em- 
peror and the President levi- 



tate a good several inches off 
the rail. 

Edna stalked from the 
house, surveyed the new ar- 
rivals without giving any in- 
dication she had recognized 
them and wagged a finger in 
her husband’s face. 

“Titus, this has gone far 
enough!” she exclaimed. “If 
you don’t — ” 

“Later, Love,” he pacified. 
“Something’s going wrong.” 

She was taken aback by his 
understatement. But he hadn’t 
meant it that way. He had 
merely expressed suspicion 
over his recurrent sensations 
of lightness. 

A lmost at the same time, 
two other ships dropped 
down at the edge of the ve- 
randa. The hatch of the first 
sprang open and disgorged a 
thin man in a swallow-tail 
coat who drew rigidly erect 
and announced : 

“His Most August Excel- 
lency, Prime Minister Netath 
of Gauyuth-Six!” 

Ogarm Netath, indignation 
branding his features, strode 
out. “Where's this Potentate 
McWorther character?” he 
demanded. 

A hundred extended fingers 
singled out Titus, who was 
just then pouring a thirteenth 
julep. 

Netath stomped over. “You* 
sir, have got my aid consign- 
ments !” 

By that time, the other ship 
had thrown open its hatch and 



GRAVY TRAIN 



129 




a short, stout man in a busi- 
ness suit emerged. 

“I am Wheeler of Rear-So- 
bucks and Company,” he dis- 
closed, standing to one side so 
that two men working with 
antigrav grapples could wres- 
tle a large crate onto the ve- 
randa. “I have an apology and 
an automatic bather for Po- 
tentate McWorther.” 

But Titus turned his back 
on the man, abruptly facing 
his wife. “Good God! What 
day is it?” 

She frowned in puzzlement. 
"Why, Wednesday.” 

There was a sharp explo- 
sion nearby as another article 
of cargo came hurtling down 
from space. 

“And it’s almost noon!” 

She nodded, still perplexed. 

“Get into the spaceabout. 
Love — quick!” 

She hesitated and he gave 
her a shove. 

But he paused and faced the 
others. “You got just about 
fifteen minutes to climb into 
your contraptions and clear 
out — all of you! Because by 
then we’ll be fresh out of 
gravity!” 

And they’d be lucky if they 
had that much time, he real- 
ized as he followed Edna into 
the small craft. He had known 
he would have to face the in- 
evitable crisis on Wednesday. 
But all along he had been off 
one day in his calculations, 
such that he had been sure to- 
day was only Tuesday. 

“What is it, Titus?” his 

130 



wife asked as he strapped 
himself in beside her. 

“The supplementary grav- 
ity generator hasn’t been re- 
fueled! It’s sputtering out!” 
From space, he watched the 
end of McWorther’s World. 

The atmosphere went first, 
swooshing outward as a result 
of abrupt decompression and 
leaving a halo of frozen water 
crystals in its wake. Then the 
cargo that was piled on the 
surface recoiled from its own 
cumulative pressure and shot 
out into space. The topsoil fol- 
lowed suit, dispersing like a 
dust storm, while the lakes 
boiled in one instant and their 
vapor froze in the next. 

Before any of the hurtling 
mess could reach his space- 
about, Titus followed the Pull- 
man crafts, the Rear-Sobucks 
delivery vehicle and the Pres- 
idential and Imperial yachts 
into hyperspace, 

T itus and Edna McWorth- 
er have given up rustic re- 
tirement. Instead they are 
living out their declining 
years in a floating villa just 
off the Jersey coast. 

Life is still gratifying, with 
the exception of one detail. 

But Titus is resolved that 
he and his wife will have to be 
content with the shower-mas- 
seur for the rest of their lives. 

At any rate, he’ll be damned 
if he’ll put in another order 
for an automatic bather, with 
or without a back-scrubbing 
attachment. END
