Beagle’s ARKHAM EDITIONS 
now include works by these 
authors as well as HPL— and this 
month’s offering is a prime pair 
from Derleth, The Mask of 
Cthulhu and The Trail of Cthulhu—3, story collection and a novel about 
hapless mortals’ involvement with the terrifying beings from between the 
dimensions— Cthulhu, Hastur the Unspeakable, Ying, the amorphous flute- 
player, and the Goat with the Thousand Young. 

And next month, we’ll have what is probably Lovecraft’s solidest novel. 
The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. 



Lovecraft Lives! 

—mainly because the stories he 
wrote and the concepts he invented 
are too gripping to stop reading 
...or to stop writing. The roster 
of writers who have carried on 
Lovecraft’s characters and ideas is 
a Who*s Who of fantasy greats— 
August Derleth, Robert Bloch, 
Frank Belknap Long, Colin Wil- 
son, Clark Ashton Smith, Henry 
Kuttner. 



Goulartifice 

—a new noun, or Beaglism, to use as a label 
for Ron Goulart’s acid zaniness and what 
the New York Times calls his “bleak but 
bracing humor.” Death Cell is the first 
novel dealing with Jack Summer of Muck- 
rake, the galactic newsmag— a first-rate 
Goulartifact.

Mr. Jakobsson: 

Having only recently acquired and 
read a complete Sherlock Holmes 
(Berkley), I was especially de- 
lighted by Slaves of Silver in the 
March/ April If. As I began the story, 
I thought I detected something 
familiar in Mr. Wolfe's fusty, late- 
nineteenth-century style. Not until 
Street began dissecting Dr. 
Westing s appearance and the im- 
plications thereof did I really catch 
on, though. Once / was wise to what 
Mr. Wolfe was doing, however, I 
found it difficult to keep a straight 
face until / had finished the story. 

Do you know if any more such works 
are or will be in the offing? I have al- 
ways enjoyed Holmes and finding a 
modern Holmes quite excites me. 

Eric C. Sanders 
Grand Blank, Mich. 

Are you there, Gene Wolfe? 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

/ have just finished reading the two 
stories by T. J. Bass in your Nov-Dec 
and Jan-Feb issues and / am over- 
whelmed. Who is he? / have been read- 
ing sci-fi for years but have never run 
across him before. I hope you will 



have more stories by him in the future. 
Incidentally, both Galaxy and If have 
become excellent magazines and I 
thank you for providing the intelli- 
gent SF reading public with con- 
sistently interesting and well- written 
stories. My one note of dissatisfac- 
tion is the exclusion of Vaughn Bode 
from Galaxy's pages. Why was thisr 
done and is there any possibility that he 
may be seen there once again?

Battalion, A PO SF 96349 

T. J. Bass is a young pathologist who 
wrote his //First in 1968. Since then he 
has appeared in both Galaxy and If 
always brilliantly. In answer to your 
last question: reader reaction did not 
encourage us to continue featuring a 
cartoon strip. 

Dear M^. Jakobsson: 

I feel that Mr. ZabeVs definition of 
science fiction as given in his letter 
(March- April *71) is merely an im- 
personal extention of the one Hein- 
lein proposed in 1952. His definition 
(then) was that sf is 'fiction about 
things that have not happened.** This 
is really a description of virtucdly all 
fiction from Joyce on out. By insert- 
ing a qualifying factor on the 
"probability*' of a story's event I like 
to think I have narrowed the scope to 
our genre. 

As to^ your comment that a story's 
"probability" depends on the writer's 
handling of events — I can not agree. 
The handling of story events may give 
them a semblance of probability they 
do not deserve — but an objective 




2 




analysis will reveal the actual like- 
lihood of a plot: I believe that it is the 
author s choice of events, and this 
alone, that determines a story* s 
** probability* *i not **plausiblity,** which 
means ability to convince). For in- 
stance, / don*t consider Fail Safe to 
be sf because the possibility of com- 
mitment to a nuclear war due to a 
burned-out fuse is all too likely. On 
the other hand, an attempt by aliens to 
cause a nuclear war by bombardment 
from the moon (as in Isaac Asimov*s 
Gentle Vultures) is a much less likely 
event and so is sf. There, of course, is 
the essential weakness of my catch- 
phrase — probability is relative. Still, 
I do not consider the point a fault — 
merely a weakness. 

As to what sf does, says or means, I 
can only answer for myself, I believe 
that any sf work can say whatever the 
author wishes it to, but what it does is 
explore change. Almost every piece of 
sf from Ralph 124C41+ through The 
High Crusade to Dune explores the 
one certainty — change — and its effects 
on people and society. This, to me, is 
what sf means — that change is certain, 
is occurring and is the single greatest 
factor in our lives. However dimly, sf 
explores the one truth that main- 
stream fiction ignores — that this too 
shall pass.

HailJakobsson! 

/ see Vogel has found in your letter 
column a new outlet for his theses. His 



definition is, as usual, an idea taken 
much too seriously with Heinlein, 
Panshin, with semantics dragged into 
shore up his position, I just read his 
latest letter (Before he mailed 
it?-^Ed) and / see he is going fo ex- 
pound his ** philosophy** of science fic- 
tion to you, too. 

In the interest of balance (all us 
Canucks aren*t idiot geniuses) I*ll 
throw in my definition, I believe it*s 
a paraphrase of a Heinlein characters 
definition of common sense and it 
goes like this: 



Science fiction is fiction that states 
that what did not happen yesterday 
will not necessarily not happen to 
morrow. 



( Vogel says the foregoing is an un- 
resolvable triple negative which is the 
sort of thing he delights in, ) 

'Take VogeVs. two examples. Fail 
Safe is about blown fuses which are as 
old as electric lights. Gentle Vultures 
deals with aliens which would be some- 
thing new in history. So by my de- 
finition Gentle Vultures is science fic- 
tion and Fail Safe ir not.

I agree — Fail Safe is about Jhe 
dangers of a blown fuse. Please, guys, 
don’t you two blow yours, both talking 
at once. But let’s hear more, even at 
the risk of overloading circuits.

J OE TRILLING had a funny 
way of making a living. It was 
a good living, but of course he 
didn’t make anything like the bun- 
dle he could have in the city. On 
the other hand he lived in the 
mountains a half mile away from 
a picturesque village in clean air 
and piney-birchy woods along with 
lots of mountain laurel and he was 
his own boss. There wasn’t much 
competition for what he did; he 
had his wife and kids around all 



the time and more orders than he 
could fill. He was one of the night 
people and after the family had 
gone to bed he could work quietly 
and uninterruptedly. He was hap- 
py as a clam. 

One night very early morning, 
really he was interrupted. Bup- 
bup, bup, bup. Knock at the win- 
dow, two shorts, two longs. He 
froze, he whirled, for he knew that 
knock. He hadn’t heard it for years 
but it had been a part of his life 
since he was born. He saw the face 
outside and filled his lungs for a

whoop that would have roused 
them at the fire station on the vil- 
lage green, but then he saw the fin- 
ger on the lips and let the air out. 
The finger beckoned and Joe Trill- 
ing whirled again, turned down a 
flame, read a gauge, made a note, 
threw a switch and joyfully but si- 
lently dove for the outside door. 
He slid out, closed it carefully, 
peered into the dark. 

“Karl?’’ 

“Shh.’’ 

There he was, edge of the woods. 
Joe Trilling went there and. 



ispering because Karl had 
asked for it, they hit each other, 
cursed, called each other the filthi- 
est possible names. It would not be 
easy to explain this to an extra-ter- 
restrial; it isn’t necessarily a 
human thing to do. It’s a cultural 
thing. It means, I want to touch 
you, it means 1 love you; but they 
were men and brothers, so they hit 
each other’s arms and shoulders 
and swore despicable oaths and 
insults, until at last even those 
words wouldn’t do and they stood 
in the shadows, holding each 



5 




others’ biceps and grinning and 
drilling into each other with eyes. 
Then Karl Trilling moved his head 
sidewards toward the road and 
they walked away from the house. 

“I don’t want Hazel to hear us 
talking,” Karl said, “I don’t want 
her or anyone to know ( was here. 
How is she?” 

“Beautiful. Aren’t you going to 
see her at all — or the kids?” 

“Yes but not this tripi There’s 
the car. We can tai^ there. I really 
am afraid of that bastard.” 

“Ah,” said Joe. “How is the 
great man?” 

“Po’ly,’’ said Karl. “But we’re 
talking about two different bas- 
tards. The great mao.Js. only the 
richest man in the world, but I’m 
not afraid of him, especially now. 
I’m talking about Cleveland 
Wheeler.” 

“Who’s Cleveland Wheeler?” 



T hey got into the car. “It’s a 
rental,” said Karl. “Matter of 
fact, it’s the second rental. I got out 
of the executive jet and took a 
company car and rented an- 
other — arid then this. Reasonably 
sure it’s not bugged. That’s one 
kirid of answer to your question, 
who’s Cleve Wheeler. Other an- 
swers would be the man behind the 
throne. Next in line. Multifaceted 
genius. Killer shark.” 

“Next ih line,” said Joe, .re- 
sponding to the only clause that 

6 



made any sense. “The old man is 
sinking?” 

“Officially— andf an official se- 
cret — his hemoglobin reading is 
four. That mean anything to you. 
Doctor?” 

“Sure does. Doctor. Malnutri- 
tive anemia, if other rumors I hoar 
are true. Richest man in the 
world — dying of starvation.” 

“And old age— and stubborn- 
ness — and obsession. You want to 
hear about Wheeler?” 

“Tell me.” 

“Mister lucky. Born with evcryr 
thing. Greek coin profile. Michael- 
angelo Qiuscles. Discovered early 
by a bright-eyed elementary school 
principal, sent to a. private school, 
used to go straight to the teachers’ 
lounge in the morning and say what 
he’d been reading or thinking 
about. Then they’d tell off a teach- 
er to work with him or go out with 
him or whatever. High school at 
twelve, varsity, track, basketball, 
football and high-diving — three 
letters'for each— yes, he grad- 
uated in three years, summa cum. 
Read ail the textbooks at the begin- 
ning of each term, never cracked 
them again. More than anything 
else he had the habit of success. 

“College, the same thing: turned 
sixteen in his first ^mester. Just ate 
everything up. Very popular. Grad- 
uated at the top again, of course.” 

Joe Trilling, who had slogged 
through college and medical school 
like a hodcarrier, grunted envious- 



IF 




ly. “Fvc seen one or two like that. 
Everybody marvels, nobody sees 
how easy it was for them.’* 

Karl shook his head. “Wasn’t 
quite like that with Cleve Wheeler. 
If anything was easy for him it was 
because of the nature of his 
equipment. He was like a four- 
hundred horsepower car moving 
in sixty-horsepower traffic. When 
his muscles were called on he used 
them, I mean really put it down to 
the floor. A very willing guy. 
Well — he had his choice of 
jobs — hell, choice of careers. He 
went into an architectural firm 
that could use his math, 
administrative ability, public 
presence, knowledge of mate- 
rials, art. Gravitated right to the 
top, got a partnership. Picked up 
a doctorate on the side while he 
was doing it. Married extremely 
well.” 

“Mister Lucky,” Joe said. 

4<1Y^ISTER LUCKY, yeah. 

iv-l Listen. Wheeler became a 
partner and he did his work and he 
knew his stuff — everything he 
could learn or understand. 
Learning and understanding are 
not enoqgh to cope with some 
things like greed or unexpected 
stupidity or accident or sheer bad 
breaks. Two of the other partners 
got into a deal I won’t bother you 
with— a high-rise apartment com- 
plex in the wrong place for the 
wrong residents and land ac- 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



quired the wrong way. Wheeler saw 
it coming, called them in and 
talked it over. They said yes-yes 
and went right ahead and did what 
they wanted anyway — something 
that Wheeler never in the world ex- 
pected. The one thing high cap-, 
ability and straight morals and a 
good education doesn’t give you 
is the end of innocence, Cleve 
Wheeler was an innocent. 

“Well, it happened, the disaster 
that Cleve had predicted, but it 
happened far worse. Things like 
that, when they surface^ have a way 
of exposing a lot of other con- 
cealed rot. The firm collapsed. 
Cleve Wheeler had never failed at 
anything in his whole life. It was 
the one thing he had no practice in 
dealing with. Anyone with the 
most rudimentary intelligence 
would have seen that this was the 
time to walk away — lie down, even. 
Cut his losses. But I don’t think 
these things even occurred to him.” 

Karl Trilling laughed suddenly. 
“In one of Philip Wylie -s novels is 
a tremendous description of a for- 
est fire and how the animals run 
away from it, the foxes and the rab- 
bits running shoulder to shoulder, 
the owls flying in the daytime to 
get ahead of the flames. Then 
there’s this beetle, lumbering 
along on the ground. The beetle 
comes to a burned patch, the edge 
of twenty acres of hell. It stops, it 
wiggles its feelers, it turns to the 
side and begins to walk around the 

7 




fire — ” He laughed again. “That’s 
the special thing Cleveland 
Wheeler has, you see, under all 
that muscle and brain and bril- 
liance. If he had to — and were a 
beetle — he wouldn’t turn back and 
he wouldn’t quit. If all he could do 
was walk around it, he’d start 
walking.’’ 

“What happened?’’ asked Joe. 
“He hung on. He used every- 
thing he had. He used his brains 
and his personality and his reputa- 
tion and all his worldly goods. He 
also borrowed and prom- 
ised — and he worked. Oh, he 
worked. Well, he kept the firm. He 
cleaned out the rot and built it all 
up again from the inSide, strong 
and straight this time. But it cost. 

“It cost him time — all the hours 
of every day but the four or so he 
used for sleeping. And just about 
when he had it leveled off and start- 
ing up, it cost him his wife.’’ 

“You said he’d married well.’’ 
“He’d married what you marry 
when you’re a young block-buster 
on top of everything and going 
higher. She was a nice enough girl, 
I suppose, and maybe you can’t 
blame her, but she was no more 
used to failure than he was. Only 
he could walk around it. He could 
rent a room and ride the bus. She 
just didn’t know how — and of 
course with women like that there’s 
always the discarded swain some- 
where in the wings.’’ 

“How did he take that?’’ 



“Hard. He’d married the way he 
played ball or took examina- 
tions— with everything he had. It 
did something to him. All this did 
things to him, I suppose, but that 
was the biggest chunk of it. 

“He didn’t let it stop him. He 
didn’t let aaything stop him. He 
went on until all the bills were 
paid — every cent. Ail the interest. 
He kept at it until the net worth 
was exactly what It had been be- 
fore his ex-partners had begun to 
eat out the core. Then he gave it 
away. Gave it away! Sold all right 
and title to his interest for a dol- 
lar.’’ 

“Finally cracked, hm?’’ 

Karl Trilling looked at his broth- 
er scornfully. “Cracked. Matter of 
definition, isn’t It? Cleve Wheel- 
er’s goal was zero — can you un- 
derstand that? What is success 
anyhow? Isn’t it making up your 
mind what you’re going to do and 
then doing it, all the way?’’ 

“In that case,’’. said his brother 
quietly, “suicide is success.’’ 

K arl gave him a long pene- 
trating look. “Right,’’ he said, 
and thought about it a moment. 

“Anyhow,’’ Joe asked, “why 
zero?’’ 

“I did a lot of research on Cleve 
Wheeler, but I couldn’t get inside 
his head. 1 don’t know. But t can 
guess. He meant to owe no man 
anything. I don’t know how he felt 
about the company he saved, but I 

IF 



8 




can imagine; The man he be- 
came — was becoming — wouldn’t 
want to owe it one damned thing. 
I’d say he just wanted out — but on 
his own terms, which included 
leaving nothing behind to work 
on him.” 

“Okay,” said Joe. 

Karl- Trilling thought. The nice 
thing about old, Joe b that he’ll 
wait. All these years apart with 
hardly any communication be- 
yond birthday cards — and not al- 
ways that — and here he bjust as if 
we were still together every day. I 
wouldn’t be here if it weren’t im- 
portant; / wouldn’t be telling him 
all thb unless he needed to know; 
he wouldn’t need any of it unless 
he was going to help. All that un- 
said — I don’t. have to ask him a 
damn thing. What am I interrupt- 
ing in hb life? What am I going to 
interrupt? / won’t have to worry 
about that. He’ll take care of it. 

He said, ’’I’m glad I came here, 
Joe.” 

Joe said, ‘‘That’s all right,” 
which meant all the things Karl 
had been thinking. Karl grinned 
and hit him on the shoulder and 
went on talking. 

‘‘Wheeler dropped out. It’s not 
easy to map his trail for that peri- 
od. It pops up all over. He lived in 
at least three communes — maybe 
more, but those three were a mess 
when he came and a model when he 
left. He started businesses — all 
things that had never happened 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



before, like a supermarket with 
no shelves, no canned music, no 
games or stamps, just neat stacks 
of open cases, where the customer 
took what he wanted and marked 
it according to the card posted 
by the case, with a marker hang- 
ing on a string. Eggs and frozen 
meat and fish and the like, and 
local produce were pric^ a flat 
two percent over wholesale. Peo- 
ple were honest because, they 
could never be sure the checkout 
counter didn’t know the prices of 
everything — besides, to cheat on 
the prices listed would have been 
just too embarrassing. With 
nothing but a big empty ware- 
house for overhead and no em- 
ployees spending thousands of 
man. hours marking individual 
items, the prices beat any di^ount 
house that ever lived. He sold that 
one, too, and moved on. He start- 
ed a line of organic baby foods 
without preservatives, fran- 
chised it and moved on again. He 
developed a plastic container 
that would burn without polluting 
and patented it and sold the 
patent.” 

‘‘I’ve heard of that one. Haven’t 
seen it around, though.” 

‘‘Maybe you will,” Karl said in a 
guarded tone. ‘‘Maybe you will. 
Anyway, he had a CPA in Pas- 
adena-handling details, and just 
did his thfng all over. I never heard 
of a failure in anything he tried.” 

‘‘Sounds like a junior edition of 

9 




the great man himself, your hon- 
ored boss.” 

“You’re not the only one who 
realized that. The boss may be a 
ding-a-ling in many ways, but no- 
body ever faulted his business 
sense. He has always had his ten- 
tacles out for wandering pieces of 
very special manpower. For all 1 
know he had drawn a bead on 
Cleveland Wheeler years back. I 
wouldn’t doubt that he’d made, of- 
fers from time to time, only during 
that period Cleve Wheeler wasn’t 
about to go to work for anyone 
that big. His whole pattern is to 
run things his way, and you don’t 
do that in an established empire.” 
“Heir apparent,” said- Joe, re- 
minding him of something he had 
said earlier. 

“Right,” nodded Karl. “I knew 
you’d begin to get the idea before I 
was finished.” 

“But finish,” said Joe. 

(4'niGHT. Now what I’m go- 
•■^ing to tell you, I just want 
you to know. I don’t expect you to 
understand it or what it means or 
what it has all done to Cleve 
Wheeler. I need your help, and you 
can’t really help me unless you 
know the whole story.” 

“Shoot.” 

Karl Trilling shot: “Wheeler 
found a girl. Her name was Clara 
Prieta and her folks came from So- 
nora. She was bright as hell — in 
her way, I suppose, as bright as 



Cleve, though with a tenth of his 
schooling — and pretty as well, and 
it was Cleve she wanted, not what 
he might get for her. She fell for 
him when he had nothing — when 
he really wanted nothing. They 
were a daily, hourly joy to each 
other. 1 guess that was about the 
time he started building this busi- 
ness and that, making something 
again. He bought a little house 
and a car. He bought two cars, one 
for her. I don’t think she wanted 
it, but he couldn’t do enoughs — he 
was always looking for more 
things to do for her. They went out 
for an evening to some friends’ 
house, she from shopping, he from 
whatever it was he was working 
on then, so they had both cars. He 
followed her on the way home and 
had to watch her lose control and 
spin out. She died in his arms.” 

“Oh, Jesus.” 

“Mister Lucky. Listen: a week 
la,ter he turned a corner down- 
town and found himself looking 
at a bank robbery. He caught a 
stray bullet — grazed the back of 
his neck. He had seven months to 
lie still and think about things. 
When he got out he was told his 
business manager had embezzled 
everything and headed south with 
his secretary. Everything.” 

“What did he do?” 

“Went to work and paid his hos- 
pital bill.” 

They sat in the car in the dark 
for a long time, until Joe said, 

IF 



10 




“Was he paralyzed, there in the 
hospital?” 

“For nearly five months.”. 

“Wonder what he thought 
about.” 

Karl Trilling said, “I can imag- 
ine what he thought about. What I 
can’t imagine is what he decided. 
What he concluded. What he deter- 
mined to be. Damn it, there are no 
accurate words for it. We all do the 
best we can with what we’ve got, or 
try to. Or should. He did — and 
with the best possible material to 
start out 'with. He played it 
straight; he worked hard; he was 
honest and lawful and fair; he was 
fit; he was bright. He dame out of 
the hospital with those last two 
qualities intact. God alone knows 
what’s happened to the rest of it.” 

“So he went to work for the old 
man.” 

“He did — and somehow that 
frightens me. It was as if all his 
qualifications were not enough to 
suit both of them until these things 
happened to him — until they made 
him become what he is.” 

“And what is that?” 

“There isn’t a short answer to 
that, Joe. The old man has become 
a modern myth. Nobody ever sees 
him. Nobody can predict what 
he’s going to do or why. Cleve- 
land Wheeler stepped into his 
shadow and disappeared almost 
as completely as the boss. There 
are very few things you can say for- 
certain. The boss has always been

a recluse and in the ten years 
Cleve Wheeler has been with him 
he has become more so. It’s been 
business as usual with him, of 
course — which means the con- 
stantly unusual — long periods of 
quiet, and then these spectacular 
unexpected wheelings and deal- 
ings. You assume that the old man 
dreams these things up and some 
high-powered genius on his staff 
gets them done. But it could be the 
genius that instigates the 
moves— who can know? Only the 
people closest to him — Wheeler, 
Epstein, me. And I don’t know.” 
“But Epstein died.” 

Karl Trilling nodded in the dark. 
“Epstein died. Which leaves only 
Wheeler to watch the store. I’m the 
old man’s personal physician, not 
Wheeler’s, and there’s no guaran- 
tee that I ever will be Wheeler’s.” 

J OE Trilling recrossed his legs 
and leaned back, looking out 
into the whispering dark. “It be- 
gins to take shape,” he murmured. 
“The old man’s on the way out, 
you very well might be and there’s 
nobody to take over but this 
Wheeler.” 

“Yes, and I don’t know what he 
is or what he’ll do. 1 do know he 
will command more power than 
any single human being on Earth. 
He’ll have so much that he'll be 
above any kind of Cupidity that j(ou 
or 1 could imagine—^pu or I can’t 
think in that order of magnitude. 

11 




But you see, he’s a man who, you 
might say, has had it proved to him 
that being good and smart and 
strong and honest doesn't par- 
ticularly pay off. Where will he go 
with all this? And hypothesizing 
that he’s been making more and' 
more of the decisions lately, and 
extrapolating from that — where 
is he going? All you can be sure of 
is that he will succeed in anything 
he tries. That is his habit.” 

“What does he want? Isn’t that 
what you’re trying to figure out? 
What would a man like that want, 
if he knew he could get it?” ' 

“I knew I’d come to the right 
place,” said. Karl almost happily. 
“That’s it exactly. Aa.for me, I 
have all I need now and there are 
plenty of other places I could go. I 
wish fpstein were still around, but 
he’s dead and cremated.” 
“Cremated?” 

“That’s right — you wouldn’t 
know about that. Old man’s 
instructions. 1 handled it myself. 
You’ve heard of the hot and cold 
private swimming pools — but I 
bet you never heard of a man with 
his own private crematorium in 
the second sub-basement.” 

Joe threw up his hands. “1 guess 
if you can reach into your pocket 
and pull out two billion real dol- 
lars, you can have anything you 
want. By the way — was that legal?” 
“Like you said — if you have two 
billion. .Actually, the county medi- 
cal examiner was present and 

12 



signed the papers. And he’ll be 
there when the .old nian pushes off 
too — it’s all in the final instruc- 
tions. Hey— wait, 1 don’t want to 
cast any aspersions on the M.E. 
He wasn’t bought. He did a very 
competent examination on Ep- 
stein.” 

“Okay — we know what to expect 
when the time comes. It’s after- 
ward you’re worried about.” 

“Right. What has the old man— 
I’m speaking of the corporate old 
man now— what has he been doing 
all along? What has he been doing 
in the last ten years, since he got 
Wheeler — and is it any different 
from what he was doing before? 
How much of this difference, if 
any, is more Wheeler than boss? 
That’s all we have to go on, Joe, 
and from it we have to extrapo- 
late what Wheeler’s going to do 
with the Biggest private eco- 
nomic force this world has ever 
known.” 

“Let’s talk about that,” said 
Joe, beginning to smile. 

Karl Trilling knew the signs, so 
he began to smile a little, too. They 
talked about it. 

II 

T he crematorium in the second 
sub-basement was purely func- 
tional, as if all concessions to sen- 
timent and ritual had been made 
elsewhere, or canceled. The latter 
most accurately described what 

IF 




had happened when at last, at long 
long last, the old man di^d. Every- 
thing was done precisely according 
to his instructions immediately af- 
ter he was certifiably dead and be- 
fore any public announcements 
were made — right up to and in- 
cluding the moment when the 
square mouth of the furnace 
opened with a startling clang, a 
blare of heat, a flare of light— the 
hue the old-time blacksmiths 
called straw color. The simple cof- 
fin slid rapidly in, small flames ex- 
ploding into being on its corners, 
and the door banged shut. It took 
a moment for the eyes to adjust to 
the bare room, the empty greased 
track, the closed door. It took the 
same moment for the conditioners 
to whisk away the sudden smell of 
scorched soft pine. 

The medical examiner leaned 
over the small table and signed his 
name twice. Karl Trilling and 
Cleveland Wheeler did the same. 
The M.E. tore off copies and fold- 
ed them and put them away in his 
breast pocket. He looked at the 
closed square iron door, opened his 
mouth, closed it again and 
shrugged. He held out his hand. 

“^Good night. Doctor." 

‘"Good night. Doctor. Rugosi's 
outside— he'll show ydu out." 

The M.E. shook hands wordless- 
ly with Cleveland Wheeler and left. 

“1 know Just what he's feeling," 
Karl said. “Something ought to be 
said. Something memorable — end 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



of an era. Like ‘One small step for 
man — 

Cleveland Wheeler smiled the 
bright smile of the college hero, fif- 
teen years after — a little less wide, 
a little less even, a great deal less in 
the eyes. He said in the voice that 
commanded, whatever he said, 
“If you think you’re quoting the 
first words from an astronaut on 
the moon, you’re not. What he said 
was from the ladder, when he 
poked his boot down. He said, ‘It's 
some kind of soft stqff. I can kick it 
around with my foot.’ I’ve always 
liked that much better. It was real, 
it wasn’t rehearsed or memorized 
or thought out and it had to do with 
that moment and the next. The 
M.E. said good night and you told 
him the chauffeur was waiting 
outside. I like that better than 
anything anyone could say. I 
think he would, too,’’ Wheeler 
added, barely gesturing, with a 
very strong, slightly cleft chin, to- 
ward the hot black door. 

“But he wasn’t exactly human." 

“So they say." Wheeler half 
smiled and, even as he turned 
away, Karl could sense himself 
tuned out, the room itself become 
of secondary importance — the 
next thing Wheeler was to do, and 
the next and the one after, becom- 
ing more real than the here and 
now. 

Karl put a fast end to that. 

He said levelly, “1 meant what I 
just said, Wheeler." 



13 




It couldn’t have been the words, 
which by themselves might have 
elicited another half-smile and a 
forgetting. It was the tone, and 
perhaps the “Wheeler.” There is a 
ritual, about these things. To those 
few on his own level, and those on 
the level below, he was Cleve. Be- 
low that he was mister to his face 
and Wheeler behind his back. No 
one of his peers would call him 
mister unless it was meant as the 
herald of an insult; no one of his 
peers or immediate underlings 
would call him Wheeler at all, 
ever. Whatever the component, 
it removed Cleveland Wheeler’s 
hand from the knob and turned 
him. His face was completely alert 
and interested. “You’d best tell 
me what you mean. Doctor.” 

Karl said, “I’ll do better than 
that. Come.” Without gestures, 
suggestions or explanations he 
walked to the left rear of the room, 
leaving it up to Wheeler to decide 
whether or not to follow. Wheeler 
followed. 

I N THE corner Karl rounded on 
him. “If you ever say anything 
about this to anyone — even me — 
when we leave here. I’ll just deny it. 
If you ever get in here again, you 
won’t find anything to back up 
your story.” He took a complex 
four-inch blade of machined stain- 
less steel from his belt and slid it 
between the big masonry blocks. 
Silently, massively, the course of 

14 



blocks in the corner began to 
move upward. Looking up at 
them in the dim light from the nar- 
row corridor they revealed, any- 
one could see that they were real 
blocks and that to get through 
them without that key and the pre- 
cise knowledge of where to put it 
would be a long-term project. 

Again Karl proceeded without 
looking around, leaving go, no-go 
as a matter for Wheeler to decide. 
Wheeler followed. Karl heard his 
footsteps behind him and noticed 
with pleasure and something like 
admiration that when the heavy 
blocks whooshed down and seated 
themselves solidly behind them, 
Wheeler may have looked over his 
shoulder but did not pause. 

“You’ve noticed we’re along- 
side the furnace,” Karl said, like a 
guided-tour bus driver. “And now, 
behind it.” 

He stood aside to let Wheeler 
pass him and see the smalLroom. 

It was just large enough for the 
tracks which protruded from the 
back of the furnace and a little 
standing space on eaclr side. On the 
far side was a small table with a 
black suitcase standing on it. On 
the track stood the coffin, its cor- 
ners carboned, its top and sides wet 
and slightly steaming. 

“Sorry to have to close that 
stone gate that way,” Karl said 
matter-of-factly. “I don’t expect 
anyone down here at all, but I 
wouldn’t want to explain any of 

IF 




this to persons other than your- 
self.” 

Wheeler was staring at the cof- 
fin. He seemed perfectly com- 
posed, but it was a seeming. Karl 
was quite aware of what it was 
costing him. 

Wheeler said, “I wish you’d ex- 
plain it to me.” And he laughed. It 
was the first time Karl had ever 
seen this man do anything badly. 

“I will. I am.” He clicked open 
the suitcase and laid it open and 
flat on the little table. There was a 
glisten of chrome and steel and 
small vials in little pockets. The 
first tool he removed was a screw- 
driver. “No need to use screws 
when you’re cremating ’em,” he 
said cheerfully and placed the tip 
under one corner of the lid. He 
struck the handle smartly with the 
heel of one hand and the lid popped 
loose. “Stand this up against the 
wall behind you, will you?” 

Silently Cleveland Wheeler did 
as he was told. It gave him some- 
thing to do with his muscles; it gave 
him the chance to turn his head 
away for a moment; it gave him a 
chance to think — and it gave Karl 
the opportunity for a quick glance 
at his steady countenance. 

Hes a mensch, Karl thought. He 
really is , 

Wheeler set up the lid neatly and 
carefully and they stood, one on 
each side, looking down into the 
coffin. 

“He — got a lot older,’’ Wheeler 
OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



said at last. 

“You haven’t seen him recent- 
ly” 

“Here and in there,’’ said the ex- 
ecutive, “I’ve spent more time in 
the same room with him during the 
past month than I have in the last 
eight, nine years. Still, it was a 
matter of minutes, each time.” 

Karl nodded understandingly. 
“I’d heard that. Phone calls, any 
time of the day or night, and then 
those long silences two days, 
three, not calling out, not having 
anyone in — ” 

“Are you going to tell me about 
the phony oven?’’ 

“Oven? Furnace? It’s not a 
phony at all. When we’ve finished 
here it’ll do the job, all right.” 
“Then why the theatricals?” 
“That was for the M.E. Those 
papers he signed are in sort of a 
never-never country just now. 
When we slide this back in and turn 
on the heat they’ll become as legal 
as he thinks they are.’’ 

“Then why—’’ 

(i'DECAUSE there are some 
-"things you have to know.’’ 
Karl reached into the coffin and 
unfolded the gnarled hands. They 
came apart reluctantly and he 
pressed them down at the sides of 
the body. He unbuttoned the 
jacket, laid it back, unbuttoned 
the shirt, unzipped the trousers. 
When he had finished with this he 
looked up and found Wheeler’s 



15 




sharp gaze, not on the old man’s 
corpse, but on him. 

“I have the feeling,” said Cleve- 
land Wheeler, ‘Hhat I have never 
seen you before.” 

Silently Karl Trilling responded: 
But you do now. And, Thanks, 
Joey. You were dead right. Joe had 
known the answer to that one 
plaguing question. How should / 
act? 

Talk just the way he talks, Joe 
had said. Be what he is, the whole 
time. 

Be what he is. A man without 
illusions (they don’t work) and 
without hope (who needs it?) who 
has the unbreakable habit of suc- 
ceeding. And who can_say it’s a 
nice day in such a way that every- 
one around snaps to attention and 
says: Yes, SIR! 

“You’ve been busy,” Karl re- 
sponded shortly. He took off his 
jacket, folded it and put it on the 
table beside the kit. He put on sur- 
geon’s gloves and slipped the ster- 
ile sleeve off a new scalpel. “Some 
people scream and faint the first 
time they watch a dissection.” 

Wheeler smiled thinly. “1 don’t 
scream and faint.” But it was not 
lost on Karl Trifling that only then, 
at the last possible moment, did 
Wheeler actually view the old 
man’s body. When he did he 
neither screamed nor fainted; he 
uttered an astonished grunt. 

“Thought that would surprise 
you,” Karl said easily. “In case 

16 



you were wondering, though, he 
really was a male. The species 
seems to be oviparous. Mammals 
too, but it has to be oviparous. I’d 
sure like a look at a female. That 
isn’t a vagina. It’s a cloaca.” 

“Until this mpment,” said 
Wheeler in a hypnotized voice, “I 
thought that ’not human’ remark 
of yours was a figure of speech,”' 

“No, you didn’t,” Karl respond- 
ed shortly. 

Leaving the words to hang in the 
air, as words will if a speaker h'as 
the wit to isolate them with wedges 
x)f silence, he deftly slit the corpse 
from the sternum to the pubic sym- 
physis. For the first-time viewer 
this was always the difficult 
moment. It’s hard not to realize 
' viscerally that the cadaver does 
not feel anything and will not pro- 
test. Nerve-alive to Wheeler, Karl 
looked for a gasp or a shudder; 
Wheeler merely held his breath. 

“We could spend hours — weeks, 
I imagine, going into the details,” 
Karl said, deftly making a trans- 
verse incision in the ensiform 
area, almost around to the trap- 
ezoid on each side, “but this is the 
thing I wanted you to see.” Grasp- 
ing the flesh at the juncture of the 
cross he had cut, on the left side, he 
pulled upward and to the left. The 
cutaneous layers came away 
easily, with the fat under them. 
They were not pinkish, but an off- 
white lavendar shade. Now the 
muscular striations over the ribs 



IF 




were in view. “If you’d palpated 
the old man’s chest,’’ he said, 
demonstrating on the right side, 
“you’d have felt what seemed to be 
normal human ribs. But look at 
this.’’ 

With a few deft strokes he sep- 
arated the muscle fibers from the 
bone on a mid-costal area about 
four inches square, and scraped. A 
rib emerged and, aa,he widened the 
area and scraped between it and 
the next one, it became clear that 
the ribs were joined by a thin flex- 
ible layer of bone or chitin. 

“It’s like baleen — whalebone,’’ 
said Karl. “See this?’’ He sec- 
tioned out a piece, flexed it. 

“My God.’’ 

Ill 

«'^OW look at this.’’ Karl 

•‘•^took surgical sheers from 
the kit, snipped through the ster- 
num *right up to the clavicle and 
then across the lower margin of 
the ribs. Slipping his fingers under 
them, he pulled upward. With a 
dull snap the entire ribcage opened 
like a door, exposing the lung. 

The lung was not pink, nor the 
liverish-browish-black of a smoker, 
but yellow — the clear bright yel- 
low of pure sulfur. 

“His metabolism,’’ Karl said, 
straightening up at last and flexing 
the tension out of his shoulders, 
“is fantastic. Or was. He lived on 
oxygen, same as us, but he broke it 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



out of carbon monoxide, sulfur 
dioxide and trioxide and carbon 
dioxide mostly. I’m not saying 
he could — I mean he had to. When 
he was forced to breathe what we 
call clean air, he could take Just so 
much of it and then had to duck out 
and find a few breaths of his own 
atmosphere. When he was young- 
er he could take it for hours at a 
time, but as the years went by he 
had to spend more and more time 
in the kind of smog he could 
breathe. Those long disappear- 
ances of his, and that reclusive- 
ness — they weren’t as kinky as peo- 
ple supposed.’’ 

Wheeler made a gesture toward 
the corpse. “But — what is he? 
Where—’’ 

“I can’t tell you. Except for a 
good deal of medical and bio- 
chemical details, you now know as 
much as I do. Somehow, some- 
where, he arrived. He came, he 
saw, he began to make his moves. 
Look at this.’’ 

He opened the other side of the 
chest and then broke the sternum 
up and away. He pointed. The lung 
tissue was not in two discreet parts, 
but extended across the median 
line. “One lung, all the way across, 
though it has these two lobes. The 
kidneys and gonads show the 
same right-left fusion.’’ 

“I’ll take your word for it,” said 
Wheeler a little hoarsely. “Damn 
it, what is it?” 

“A featherless biped, as Plato 

17 




once described homo sap. I don’t 
know what it is. I just know that it 
is — and I thought you ought to 
know. That’s all.” 

“But you’ve seen one before. 
That’s obvious.” 

“Sure. Epstein.” 

“Epstein?” 

“Sure. The old man had to have 
a go-between — someone who 
could, without suspicion, spend 
long hours with him and hours 
away. The old man could do a lot 
over the phone, but not every- 
thing. Epstein was, you might say, 
a right arm that could hold its 
breath a little longer tl\an he could. 
It got to him in the end, though, 

and he died of it.” 

“Why didn’t you say something 
long before this?” 

“First of all, I value my own 
skin. 1 could say reputation, but 
skin is the word. I signed a con- 
tract as his personal physician be- 
cause he needed a personal phy- 
sician — another bit of window- 
dressing. But I did precious little 
doctoring — except over the 

phone— ‘and .jiine-tenths of that 
was, I realized quite recently, 
purely diversionary. Even a doc- 
tor, I suppose, can be a trusting 
soul. One or the other would call 
and give a set of symptoms and I’d 
cautiously suggest and prescribe. 
Then I’d get another call that the 
patient was improving and that 
was that. Why, I even got speci- 
mens — blood, urine, stools — and 



did the pathology on them and 
never realized that they were from 
the same source as what the medi- 
cal examiner checked out and 
signed for.” 

“What do you mean, same 
source?” 

Karl shrugged. “He could get 
anything he wanted— anything.” 

“Then — what the M.E. exam- 
ined wasn’t—” he waved a hand at 
the casket. 

COURSE not. That’s why 

Vrthe crematorium has a back 
door. There’s a little pocket 
sleight-of-hand trick you can buy 
for fifty cents that operates the 
same way" This body here was 
inside the furnace. The ringer — a 
look-alike that came from God 
knows where; I swear to you I 
don’t — was lying out there waiting 
for the M.E. When the button was 
pushed the fires started up and that 
coffin slid in — pushing this one 
out and at the same time drench- 
ing it with water as it came 
through. While we’ve been in here, 
the human body is turning to 
ashes. My personal private se- 
cret instructions, both for Epstein 
and for the boss, were to wait until 
1 was certain I was alone and then 
come in here after an hour and 
push the second button, which 
would slide this one back into the 
fire. I was to do no investiga- 
tions, ask no questions, make no 
reports. It came through as logi- 



18 



IF 




cal but not reasonable, like so 
many of his orders.” He laughed 
suddenly. “Do you know why the 
old man — and Epstein too, for 
that matter, in case you never 
noticed— wouldn’t shake hands 
with anyone?” 

“I presumed it was because he 
had an obsession with germs.” 

“It was because his normal body 
temperature was a hundred and 
seven.” 

Wheeler touched one of his own 
hands with the other and said noth- 
ing. 

When Karl felt that the wedge of 
silence was thick enough he asked 
lightly, “Well, boss, where do we 
go from here?” 

Cleveland Wheeler turned away 
from the corpse and to Karl slow- 
ly, as if diverting his mind with an 
effort. 

“What did you call me?” 

“Figure of speech,” said Karl 
and smiled. “Actually, I’m 
working -for the company — and 
that’s you. I’m under orders, which 
have been finally and completely 
discharged when I push that but- 
ton — I have no others. So it really 
is up to you.” 

Wheeler’s eyes fell again to the. 
corpse. “You mean about him? 
This? What we should do?” 

“That, yes. Whether to burn it 
up and forget it — or call in top 
management and an echelon of 
scientists. Or scare the living hell 
out of everyone on Earth by phon- 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



ing the papers. Sure, that has to be 
decided, but I was thinking on a 
much wider spectrum than that.” 

“Such as— ” 

Karl gestured toward the box 
with his head. “What was he doing 
here, anyway? What has he done? 
What was he trying to do?” 

“You’d better go on,’’ said 
Wheeler; and for the very first 
time said something in a way that 
suggested diffidence. “You’ve had 
a while to think about all this, 
I--” and almost helplessly, he 
spread his hands. 

“1 can understand that,” Karl 
said gently. “Up to now I’ve been 
coming on like a hired lecturer 
and I know it. I’m not going to 
embarrass you with personalities 
except to say that you’ve absorbed 
all this with less buckling of the 
knees than anyone in the world I 
could think of.” 

iCniGHT. Well, there’s a sim- 

•l\ple technique you learn in 
elementary algebra. It has to do 
with the construction of graphs. 
You' place a dot on the graph 
where known data put it. You get 
more data, you put down another 
dot and then a third. With just 
three dots— of course, the more 
the better, but it can be done with 
three — you can connect them and 
establish a curve. Thi§ curve has 
certain characteristics and it’s 
fair to extend the curve a little 
farther with the assumption that 



19 




later data will bear yqaout.” 
“Extrapolation.” 

“Extrapolation. X axis, the for- 
tunes of our late boss. Y axis, time. 
The curve is his fortunes — that is to 
say, his influence.” 

“Pretty tall graph.” 

“Over thirty years.” 

“Still pretty tall.” 

“All right,” said Karl. “Now,' 
over the same thirty years, another 
curve: change in the environ- 
ment.” He held up a hand. “Tm 
not going to read you a treatise on 
ecology. Let’s be more objective 
than that. Let’s just say changes. 
Okay: a measurable rise in the 
mean temperature because of 
GO 2 and the greenhouse effect. 
Draw the (iurve. Incidence of 
heavy metals, mercury and lith- 
ium, in organic tissue. Draw a 
curve. Likewise chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, hypertrophy of 
algae due to phosphates, inci- 
dence of coronaries ... All right, 
let’s superimpose all these curves 
on the same graph.” 

“I see what you’re getting at. 
But you have to be careful with 
that kind of statistics game. Like, 
the increase of traffic fatalities 
coincides with the increased use 
of aluminum cans and plastic- 
tipped baby pins.” 

“Right. I don't think I’m falling 
into that trap. I just want to find 
reasonable answers to a couple 
of otherwise unreasonable situa- 
tions. One is this: if the changes oc- 

20 



curring in our planet are the re- 
sult of mere carelessness — a more 
or less random thing, careless- 
ness— then how come nobody is 
being careless in a way that bene- 
fits the environment? Strike that. I 
promised, no ecology lessons. Re- 
phrase: how come all these care- 
lessnesses promote a change and 
not a preservation? 

“Next question: What is the di- 
rection of the change? You’ve seen 
speculative writing about ‘terra- 
forming’— altering other planets to 
make them habitable by humans. 
Suppose an effort were being made 
to change this planet to suit 
someone else? Suppose they 
wanted more water and were will- 
ing to melt the polar caps by the 
greenhouse effect? Increase the 
oxides of sulfur, eliminate cer- 
tain marine forms from plankton 
to whales? Reduce the population 
by increases in lung cancer, 
emphysema, heart attacks and 
even war?” 

B oth men found themselves 
looking down at the sleeping 
face in the coffin. Karl said softly, 
“Look what he was into— petro- 
chemicals, fossil fuels, food 
processing, advertising, all the 
things that made the changes or 
helped the changers—” 

“You’re not blaming him for all 
of it.” 

“Certainly not. He found willing 
helpers by the million.” 



IF 




“You don’t think he was tiying 
to change a whole planet just so he 
could be comfortable in it.” 

“No, I don’t think so — and 
that’s the central point I have to 
make. I don’t know if there are 
any more around like him and Ep- 
stein, but I can suppose this: if the 
changes now going on keep on — 
and accelerate — then we can ex- 
pect them.” 

Wheeler said, “So ,what would 
you like to do? Mobilize the world 
against the invader?” 

“Nothing like. that. I think I’d 
slowly and quietly reverse the 
changes. If this planet is normally 
unsuitable to them, then I’d keep 
it so. I don’t think they’d have to 
be driven back. I think they just 
wouldn’t come.” 

“Or they’d try some other way.” 
“I don’t think so,” said Karl. 
“Because they tried this one. If 
they thought they could do it with 
fleets of spaceships and super-zap 
guns, they’d be doing it. No — this 
is their way and if it doesn’t work, 
they can try somewhere flse.” 
Wheeler began pulling thought- 
fully at his lip. Karl said softly, 
“All it would take is someone who 
knew what he was doing, who 
could command enough clout and 
who had the wit to make it pay. 
They might even arrange a man’s 
life — to get the kind of man they 
need.” 

And before Wheeler could an- 
swer, Karl took up his scalpel. 

OCCAM'S SCALPEL 



“I want you to do something 
for me,” he said- sharply in a new, 
commanding tone — actually, 

Wheeler’s own. “I want you to do 
it because I’ve done it and I’ll be 
damned if I want to be the only 
man in the world who has.” 

Leaning over the head of the 
casket, he made an incision along 
the hairline from temple to temple. 
Then, bracing his elbows against 
the edge of the box and steadying 
one hand with the other, he drew 
the scalpel straight down the 'cen- 
ter of the forehead and down on to 
the nose, splitting it exactly in two.v 
Down he went through the upper 
lip and then the lower, around the 
point of the chin and under it to 
the throat. Then he stood up. 

“Put your hands on his cheeks,” 
he ordered. Wheeler frowned brief- 
ly (how long had it been since any- 
one had spoken to him that way?), 
hesitated then did as he was told. 

“Now press your hands together 
and down.” 

The incision widened slightly 
under the pressure, then abruptly 
the flesh gave and the entire skin 
of the face slipped off. The unex- 
pected lack of resistance brought 
Wheeler’s hands to the bottom of 
the coffin and he found himself 
face to -face, inches away, with the 
corpse. 

Like the liings and kidneys, the 
eyes — eye? — passed the median, 
very slightly reduced at the center. 
The pupil was oval, its long axis 

21 




transverse. The skin was pale lav- 
endar with yellow vessels and in 
place of a nose was a thread- 
fringed hole. The mouth was cir- 
cular, the teeth not quite radially 
placed; there was little chin. 

Without moving, Wheeler 
closed his eyes, held them shut for 
one second, two, and then courage- 
ously opened them again. Karl 
whipped around the en^ of the cof- 
fin and got an arm around Wheel- 
er’s chest. Wheeler leaned on it 
heavily for a moment, then stood 
up quickly* and brushed the arm 
away. 

“You didn’t have to do that.’’ 
“Yes, I did,’’ said Karl. “Would 
you want to be the otrfy man in the 
world who’d.gone through that — 
with nobody to tell it to?’’ 

And after all, Wheeler could 
laugh. When he had. finished he 
said, “Push that button.’’ 

“Hand me that cover.’’ 

Most obediently Cleveland 
Wheeler brought the coffin lid and 
they placed it. 

Karl pushed the button and they 
watched the coffin slide into the 
square of flame. Then they left. 

J OE TRILLING had a funny 
way of making a living. It was a 
good living, but of course he didn’t 
make anything like the bundle he 
could have made in the city. On 
the other hand, he lived in the 
mountains a half-mile away from 
a picturesque village, in clean air 
and piney-birchy woods along with 



lots of mountain laurel and he was 
his own boss. There wasn’t much 
competition for what he did. 

What he did was to make simu- 
lacra of medical specimens, most- 
ly for the armed forces, although 
he had plenty of orders from medi- 
cal schools, film producers and an 
occasional individual, no questions 
asked. He could make a model of 
anything inside, affixed to or pene- 
trating a body or any part of it. 
He could make models to be 
looked at, models to be felt, 
smelled and palpated. He could 
give you gangrene that stunk or 
dewy thyroids with real dew on 
them. He could make one-of-a- 
kind or he could set up a produc- 
tion line. Dr. Joe Trilling was, to 
put it briefly, the best there was at 
what he did. 

“The clincher,’’ Karl told him 
(in much more relaxed circum- 
stances than their previous ones; 
daytime now, with beer), “the real 
clincher was the face bit. God, Joe, 
that was a beautiful piece of 
work.’’ 

“Just nuts and bolts. The beauti- 
ful part was your idea — his hands 
on it.’’ 

“How do you mean?’’ 

“I’ve been thinking back to 
that,’’ Joe said. “I don’t think you 
yourself realize how brilliant a 
stroke that was. It’s all very well 
to set up a show for the guy, but 
to make him put his hands as well 
as his eyes and brains on it — that 

IF 



22 




was the stroke of genius. It’s like- 
well, I can remember when I was a 
kid coming home from school and 
putting my hand on a fence rail 
and somebody had spat on it.” He 
displayed his hand, shook it. ”A11 
these years I can remember how 
that felt. All these years couldn’t 
wear it away, all those scrubbings 
couldn’t wash it away. It’s more 
than a cerebral or psychic thing, 
Karl — more than the memory of 
an episode. I think there’s a kind 
of memory mechanism in the cells 
themselves, especially on the 
hands, that can be invoked. What 
I’m getting to is that no matter 
how long he lives, Cleve Wheeler is 
going to feel that skin slip under 
his palms and that is going to 
bring him nose to nose with that 
face. No, you’re the genius, not 
me. 

“Na. You knew what you were 
doing. I didn’t.” 

‘‘Hell you didn’t.” Joe leaned 
far back in his lawn chaise — so far 
he could hold up his "beer and look' 
at the sun through it from the un- 
derside. Watching the receding 
bubbles defy perspective (because 
they swell as they rise), he mur- 
mured, ‘‘Karl?” 

“Yuh.” 

‘‘Ever hear of Occam’s Razor?” 

‘‘Uiii. Long time back. Philo- 
sophical principle. Or logic or 
something. Let’s see. Given an ef- 
fect and a choice of possible 
causes, the simplest cause is al- 

OCCAAA'S SCALPEL 



ways the one most likely to be 
true. Is that it?” 

‘‘Not too close, but close 
enough,” said Joe Trilling lazily. 
‘‘Hm. You’re the one who used to 
proclaim that logic is sufficient 
unto itself and need have nothing 
to do with truth.” 

‘‘1 still proclkim it.” 

‘‘Okay. Now, you and I know 
that human greed and careless- 
ness are qtiite enough all by them- 
selves to wreck this planet. We 
didn’t think that was enough for 
the likes of Cleve Wheeler, who 
can really do something about it, 
so we constructed him a smog- 
breathing extra-terrestrial. I 
mean, he hadn’t done anything 
about saying the world for our 
reasons, so we gave, him a whizzer 
of a reason if his own. Right out 
of our heads.” 

‘‘Dictated by all available fac- 
tors. Yes. What are you getting 
at, Joe?” 

‘‘Oh — ^just that our complicated 
hoax is simple, really, in the sense 
that it brought everything down to 
a single cause. Occam’s Razor 
slices things down to simplest 
causes. Single causes have a fair 
chance of being right.” 

Karl put down his beer with a 
bump. ‘‘1 never thought of that. 
I’ve been too busy to think of that. 
Suppose we were righfl" 

They looked at each other, 
shaken. 

At last Karl said, ‘‘What do we 
look for. now, Joe — space ships?” •

JAMES A. GOTAAS 

The secret of the alien form 
was the terror it caused! 

T he village looked peaceful 
from the hill road, a scattering 
of houses and fields well within the 
congestion code limits. I knew it 
fairly well, merely as a commu- 
nity 1 had passed through on my 
rounds. It was typical of Sarus. 
Sarus is officially IILRC 42379 
IVa, which just means it’s the 
•fourth planet of a main sequence 
star with planets, and that Sarus it- 
self is moonless. But aside from 
that, enough like Old Terra to 
cause restless people to settle 
here, despite our 1.08 gravity. The 
extra .08 isn’t much, of course, but 
Sarus was settled during the Third 
Expansion Wave out from Old 
Terra and they were choosy then. 

Anyway, in the n generations 
since then, the Sarans had adapted 
to the additional gravity, the slight- 
ly higher radiation background 
and the beautiful climate. I say n, 

24 



because nobody has realty 
bothered to count. They have been 
too busy building paradise. And 
succeeding at least as well as any 
other human world. Within limits 
that must be kept. 

Which is why i’m here. Funny, 
even though I was born on 
Novterra, I can almost look at 
Sarus as home. Which is the proper 
outlook for a Seeker, if he doesn’t 
carry it to emotional extremes. I 
don’t. And when I do get carried 
away, some task comes up that re- 
quires a Seeker. And most of these 
are still humanly bad enough to 
give me back my perspective. 

Such as a murdered Warranter. 

1 reined in before the stone tow- 
er with the bright blue pennant, 
swung off my adjusted horse. 
Freida was riding my shoulder as 
usual, her tail curled up around my 
left ear. The man who came out to 
greet me gave her a casual glance, 
then returned his gaze to my gray 
uniform. 

“Seeker?” 

“Of course,” I responded. 
“Healer MacDonald?” 

The other nodded. “I have been 
waiting for you. The Warranter’s 
body is in stasis and I have per- 
formed the tasks you required of 
me.” He pursed his lips. “Murder, 
quite definitely. With a hunt 
thrower, left in. It was a ceremoni- 
al thrower, an heirloom.” 

“You recognize the pattern?” 
“Yes. But there is something else 

I TO SEEK ANOTHER 



I must tell you. The thrower be- 
longed to Freeman Delver. And 
he—” 

“What, Healer?” I could sense 
the trouble he was having. 

“He is dead. Suicide.” 

“How long ago?” I demanded, 
suddenly getting that cold lump 
spreading through the pit of my 
stomach, a premonition of 
trouble to come. 

“This morning. About two hours 
after the death of the Warranter .” 

“You’re sure it was suicide?” 

He nodded. “It was done with a 
neural massager. Set to overload. 
It was fused into his hand, and the 
activation stud had his pore pat- 
terns on it.” 

It was a suddenly different scene 
from the one I’d expected. “You 
have his body?” 

“Inside,” the Healef answered, 
nodding. 

“Are you sure Delver murdered 
the Warranter?” 

“I am now. We found the War- 
ranter’s stock in his pouch.” He 
sounded sure of himself. 

“I want to see it.” 

He nodded, turned back in, wav- 
ing to me to follow. 

A SEEKER isn’t a detective, 
except by accident. He is just 
a man trained to handle difficulties. 
And when a man is murdered most 
villages consider that a diffi- 
culty. P could only recall one other 
that I’d handled. A simple crime of 

25 




passion. But this one was adding 
up to lunacy. Which is out of place 
in the order of paradise, even a hu- 
man paradise. 

We passed through the outer hall 
into the Healer’s tech chamber. It 
wasn’t comparable to a med 
center in a major city, but it was 
adequate for the needs here and 
more than an uninformed person 
might expect to Find in a small vil- 
lage. The Healer waved some view- 
lights on, pointed out the stasis 
beds that held the bodies of the 
Warranter and Freeman Delver. 
I looked at them, the Warranter’s 
lanky form clad in blue, with a 
stain of blood above the heart; the 
freeman’s stocky body, contorted 
with the frozen after-effects of 
neural overload. .Not a pleasant 
way to die. 

“Any ideas. Healer? You knew 
Delver.’’.! was groping. Just trying 
to gain time to compose myself. I 
didn’t see death every day. 

“Yes,’’ and there was a curious 
eagerness in his voice. “Delver 
longed to visit the starports, go 
out from there to the stars. He 
spoke of it often, revealed his 
longing to everyone.” The other 
shook his head. “Longing? Nay, 
some called it lust. An indecent 
lust. Seeker.” 

“How much was taken?” 

“Six thousand credits. It is in the 
pouch,” he added, motioning at a 
purse that lay at the base of the 
stasis bed. 



Freida jumped Off my shoulder, 
padded over to the open pouch. I 
looked back at the Healer. 

“Was that everything the War- 
ranter had?” 

The man shrugged. “We would 
not know. It was the Warranter’s 
private affair.” 

Of course, that was natural. A 
warranter was officially a public 
servant, authorized to make loans, 
issue travel and identification 
documents and perform various 
other minor tasks. He drew his 
funds from the people of his 
village, but it was part of the nature 
of his impartiality that none ex- 
cept he and his sector superior were 
actually aware of the total amount 
he had available for his people. 
But that amount, 6,000 credits, was 
a bit large. 

“Six thousand credits in ready 
funds? A very prosperous com- 
munity.” 

The Healer flushed. “We pay 
our tithes. Seeker,” he said snap- 
pishly. 

I smiled. “No criticism in- 
tended, Freeman MacDonald. It 
was rather a compliment.” He 
nodded his acceptance of the 
apology. “As for your theory, that 
is enough to buy passage any- 
where, with credits left over. But 
why suicide then? The freeman 
could hardly have guessed that a 
Seeker would be so close.” 

MacDonald shrugged. “Repen- 
tance. He realized once the pas- 



26 



IF 




sion was past that he could not 
accept the future he had plotted. 
And with murder already done, 
his own death was the Easiest way.” 
I nodded, not allowing my doubt 
to appear on the surface. But 
penance by suicide seemed un- 
likely on the part of someone who 
had the capability to murder an in- 
nocent Warranter in the first 
plaee. Freida mewed and I leaned 
down to allow her to regain her 
perch. 

“Aye, six thousand,” she whis- 
pered into my ear. Freida’s also 
an adjusted animal. AIQ esti- 
mated at nearly 100. Vocal 
abilities also added. Her tail 
pointed out a lump of fur that lay 
huddled at the foot of the War- 
ranter’s stasis bed'. I stepped closer, 
recognized it. An adjusted cat, 
similar to Freida. And stunned 
with something. I looked back at 
MacDonald. 

“Is that cat the Warranter’s?” 
“Aye. It wouldn’t leave his, form 
and was setting up a racket. So I 
mercifully stunned it.” If my 
hunch was right the merciful act 
was directed more at the Healer’s 
comfort, but that was a minor 
factor. 

“Can you wake it?” 

“Of course. But why? It’ll just 
start the wail again.” 

Smiling humorlessly, I said, “I’ll 
suffer it. Healer. Now.” My 
patience was growing thin. Mumb- 
ling to himself, the Healer grab- 



bed a syrihge, moved over to the 
cat. Jabbing the needle into the 
side of the animal, he shot a dose of 
drugs into it. After a few seconds 
it started to move slowly, abruptly 
shook itself and started to howl. 
The Healer smiled with satis- 
faction. 

I IGNORED him, stooped down 
over the cat. Freida hissed some- 
thing at it and the other animal 
shut up. I gathered it into my 
hands, brought it near my face. 
“Speech, little one?” I asked gent- 
ly. The cat stared back fearfully, 
but refused the offer. I nodded at 
Freida and she hissed some more, 
communicating in that strange 
tongue that is neither human 
lingua nor natural catspeech, but 
the mingling of both. It took a few 
minutes and I realized the orig- 
inal conditioning had held well. 
The cat would not easily betray its 
master. But finally Freida con- 
vinced it. 

“Aye, milord?” it squeaked. 

“Did you see your master die?” 
wondering as I asked if the cat 
had the intellect to handle the con- 
cepts involved. 

“Aye, to my sorrow, milord. 
My life forliis, if I had the chance, 
milord. But no!” 1 could recognize 
from long contact with Freida that 
the cat was close to hysteria. 

“Who, little one? The man who 
lies here beside your master?” 

The animal turned to stare, H- 

27 



TO SEEK ANOTHER 




nally trembled. “Aye, milord.” 

I switched tack. “Did you help 
your master?” 

“Aye,” the cat responded eager- 
ly. “Much did Grayfur help 
master. I was his memory.” 

And that was the explanation for 
a simple Warranter's owning an 
adjusted animal. The cat was a 
bio-comp specialty, capable of 
handling all the Warranter's 
bookkeeping in its special brain. 
But that also made things simpler. 
“Grayfur, how much did your 
master have now?” 

“How much? Forbidden!” 

The response was not entirely 
dictaUd by loyalty; the cat was 
probably programed- ta respond 
to certain combinations of words 
that I didn't know. But the answer 
I wanted could be reached without 
them. 

“Not to me,'' 1 said gently. 
“How much, Grayfur?” 

The cat seemed to ponder the 
idea and Freida hissed at it once 
more. Then, it all but nodded. 

“Fifteen thousand credits free, 
twenty thousand in storage.” The 
Figures rolled out of the cat, ihd I 
laughed at the incongruity. But 
then it hit me. 

“Fifteen thousand credits free? 
Is Grayfur sure?” 

The cat seemed astonished. 
“Grayfur never failed master. Am 
right.” 

I let the cat jump to the floor, 
motioned for Freida to join it, 

28 



then turned to MacDonald. “Was 
there any left at the Warranter’s 
house?” 

“No,” he answered abruptly. I 
realized he was taken aback by the 
adjusted cat. He probably had 
known of them, but never dreamed 
that one lived in his own village. 
Just like any other villager. 

“Then are you sure Delver only 
had six thousand credits?” 

“Yes,” he answered nervously. 
“Why?” 

I djidn't answer him, merely 
looked to Freida. “Freida, could 
the shock, have disturbed Grayfur 
so that he forgot his numbers?” 

The other cat snarled at the in- 
sult, but Freida considered it care- 
fully. Then her tail arched a care- 
ful negative. I looked back at 
MacDonald. 

“Healer, nine thousand credits 
are missing. Where could they 
have gone?” 

The man seemed paralyzed. 

“Stolen off Delver's body? Or 
what?” I demanded. 

He must have thought I was ac- 
cusing him, for he turned pale. 
“No, Seeker. No one here was 
alone with the body. That is, not 
until the money was counted. If 
credits were stolen from Delver, it 
was by some outsider.” 

1 stepped toward him, grasped 
his shoulders, applied pressure. 
“Healer, the truth. I'll have it one 
way or another.” 

I read the answer in his eyes and 

IF 




no words were necessary. He was 
telling the truth as he knew it. No 
one else had taken the money. But 
9,000 credits were missing. A 
thought struck me and I looked 
back at the cats. 

“Grayfur, how much did the 
thief take?” 

The cat hesitated, then said, 
“The man took all of it. Fifteen 
thousand credits — and the 

master's travel kit and spare suits.” 

I froze. It had been a wild 
chance. Out of the mouths of 
babes, surely. But from the mouths 
of cats? A travel kit and suits? 
Why? Where were they now? Dur- 
ing that two hours between the 
deaths, something had happened. 

A n outside sound intruded. 

The buzzing of my communi- 
cator in the horse’s pack drifted to 
me. A quick glance around to 
make sure MacDonald stayed put 
and I ran out to my horse. Pulling 
out the com, I cut into the chan- 
nel. 

“Seeker Carver here.” 

“Dan, this is a general alert. A 
tamper wagon is on the loose. 
Picked it out in Grailey, about 
Fifteen kilometers from where you 
are. Escaped me. It’s a job from 
outspace. Mech-assisted wagon. 
He ditched his horses and Just 
moved out on hover. Heading 
your way. Can you try for an inter- 
cept?” 

The urgency of the present task 



caught at me, but a tamper wagon 
overrode it by far. To have one of 
those loose in this area could dis- 
rupt every village in the sector and 
wreak havoc with planning. 

“Affirmative, Harlan. Will try. 
Do you have a fix?” 

“No tech Fix, but I got a smelly 
on the wagon before he got out of 
range.’’ 

“Right. I’m riding. Warrior, so 
that’ll be enough. I’ll contact you 
afterward. Carver out.” I turned 
back, saw the Healer staring at 
me. 

"‘What is it?” 

“Tamper wagon. Amateur bio- 
architect. I’ve got to go after 
him.” 

“But what about this?” 

“It can wait. I’ll be back.” 

MacDonald shook his head. “I 
still don’t understand. That wagon 
was probably the one that came 
through here a few weeks ago. I 
checked him out and he wasn’t 
working.” 

I looked at him coldly. “A po- 
tential tamper wagon came 
through here and you didn’t repo.rt 
it?” 

“He wasn’t working. All his 
equipment was torn down.” 

“Maybe. And maybe not. But 
I’ll handle you later. I have to 
move out now. Just be sure not to 
fool with anything here, eh?” I 
niounted Warrior and Freida 
came out, joined me with a leap. I 
gave the. Healer one more stare.

wheeled Warrior around and sped 
out of the village, moving through 
the crowds that had gathered at 
the commotion. 

1 leaned down over the horse’s 
ear. 

“All right. Warrior, a smelly. 
Find it. And speed, boy, speed.” 

He whinnied his understanding 
and his nostrils flared as he soaked 
in the odors of the surrounding 
countryside. The smelly would 
penetrate for kilometers. And 
Warrior would locate the scent of 
the tiny beast at the range. 
Abruptly he signaled his success 
and broke into his fastest gallop, 
twice as fast as any horse on Old 
Terra had ever run. The* adjusted 
animals could top any natural. 
Leaving the guidance to him, I 
reached back into my pack, drew 
out the regulation weapon I’d been 
issued so long ago. It was deadly, 
buUamperers could be, too. 

It was a long ride and a hard 
one. The wagon hadn’t headed di- 
rectly toward me, that was certain. 
But the tamperer couldn’t suspect 
that another Seeker was after him. 
And though he should have known 
better from his trade, he probably 
ignored the capabilities of our ad- 
justed animals. Being from out- 
space, and with a mech-assisted 
wagon, he had to be one of those 
arrogant roamers from a tech- 
overrun world. He had chosen an 
easy hit for a few months. And in- 
stead had found a trap closing on 

30 



him. Sarus was ready for his kind 
of operation. 

W ARRIOR overtook the wag- 
on from the side, running si- 
lently, maneuvering in the best 
operations manner he had mas- 
tered. The gene-runner was unsus- 
pecting, loafing along. We drew to 
within fifteen meters before I is- 
sued a warning. The owner’s head 
popped out of the control section, 
looking startled. He ducked back, 
started to slow. Warrior continued 
the approach. 

Then, abruptly, the tamperer 
flung the wagon toward us, trying 
to run us down. But Warrior’s re- 
flexes were too good. The horse 
jumped out of range of the first 
attack. 1 forgot about warnings 
and took careful aim from atop 
Warrior’s heaving back. It cost 
me two shots to mangle the 
wagon’s fancy hovergear and send 
it crashing into the ground at 
thirty kilometers per hour. It 
tumbled over, righted itself and 
lay there, smoke beginning to drift 
out of the damaged hull. 

1 kept the laser out as I ap- 
proached. Freida moved ahead to 
scout and signaled that the man 
was out of action. I dismounted 
and moved inta the slightly 
crumpled vehicle. It was fancier 
than it looked. There was no 
danger of explosion — the auto- 
matic damage control systems had 
taken over. I straightened out his 

IF 




limp form in a chair, sat down my- 
self. Freida brought the com and I 
opened the channel as I watched 
him, 1 

“Harlan, come in. I’ve got him.” 
There was a pause. Then Harlan 
replied. 

“Have any trouble, Dan?” 

I looked at the unconscious 
form, the disarrayed interior, and 
smiled thinly. “A little. He tried to 
run me down and failed. I had to 
stop his wagon with my laser.” 
There was concern in Harlan’s 
voice as he said, “I assume you’re 
all right. How about the wagon, 
was it destroyed? And what about 
the man?” 

“His damage control managed 
to prevent any serious damage. 
Just a lazed hoverstructure. He’s 
unconscious, but no serious in- 
juries. I’H hold him until you can 
get here.” 

“Right. Where are you?” 

I hesitated, looked out at the sur- 
rounding area. “About two kilo- 
meters away from Mount Grover. 
Almost straight out the main 
valley, just about to the river cross- 
ing. Good enough?” 

“Yeah. We’re not too far away. 
Be there in a half-hour, maybe 
less.” 

“Okay, out.” 

I stuck the com into my belt, 
looked at the tamperer once more. 
He was still out, so I detailed 
Freida to watch him, began to 
look around the wagon.

ment, just so he can catch 
operators like this one. He had the 
usual run of equipment, most 
fitted for disappearing into hull 
recesses to foil inquisitive peo- 
ple. I saw an electronscope, laser 
scalpel, standard diagnostic bank 
and a comp for handling gene 
manipulation and restructuring. 
Along one wall ran a few small 
compartments, translucent but 
obvious. I stepped over to the 
growth tanks, thumbed the con- 
trols of one. A side panel faded in- 
to transparency and I saw the de- 
veloping form of a small cat, with 
some obvious physical altera- 
tions. A novelty item, I thought 
disgustedly. 

1 thumbed it back to trans- 
lucence, turned away. At the back 
of the wagon was a wall of books 
and tapes, with a viewer, I stepped 
over to it, scanned the shelves and 
felt mildly impressed. He was no 
incompetent, even if he had taken 
the route of the traveling tamperer. 
The texts were impressive, 
ranging far beyond the requisites 
for biotech alterations. Then a set 
of controls on the viewer caught 
my eye. I looked closer, pressed an 
inconspicuous button. The wall 
began to slide apart until a larger 
growth chamber stood revealed. 
Large enough for a man. And 
suddenly I realized this man had 
stopped at nothing.

Freida hissed a warning that was 
cut off by a yelp of pain. I whirled, 
my laser ready, found myself con- 
fronting the tamperer, who also 
held a pocket laser, aimed right at 
me. 

“All right. Seeker, drop it.” 

I stared at him, shook my head 
slowly. “I’m not crazy. We’ve got a 
deadlock here. You fire, and you’re 
dead. Same here.’’ 1 paused. “Af- 
ter all, the penalty for tampering 
isn’t death.’’ 1 looked at him, 
studying, his reaction. “Are you 
that anxious to see me dead?” 

He frowned at me. Then the 
laser clattered to the floor. 

“Logical, Seeker. And correct. 
What will you do?’’ 

“Enough. Confiscate your wag- 
on, deport you to pjace of origin 
and alert authorities there of your 
operations.” 

He laughed. “Yes, just enough. 
^No grudges? No fanatical desire 
to see me punished severely?” 

I shrugged. “To what purpose? 
We wouldn’t accomplish any- 
thing. As'long as you’re not oper- 
ating here any more we’re satis- 
fied. What’s your name?” 

“Jansen, Jacob Jansen.’’ He 
looked past me to the revealed 
growth chamber. “1 see you’ve 
found my pride and joy.” 

I turned carefully to. look at the 
chamber once more. “Artificial 
growth?” 

“Of course. But even better than 
that. Cloning, Seeker, with any de- 

32 



viations you want on the way. 
Care for a liVing robot that looks 
just like you? One that’ll -obey any 
order and be your twin?” He 
laughed. “I can do it. You know. 
I’m good enough to set up legal 
practice on some inner world.” 

I gave him a frozen stare. “Then 
why don’t you?” 

“No thrill. I’m not a researcher. 
Besides, they frown on cloning — 
and cloning fascinates me. To 
watch a man grow, become an ar- 
tificial twin.” Laughing again, he 
continued, “Makes me feel like a 
god.” 

li 

I KEPT my eyes on his wonder- 
ing if he could read my dislike. 
I wasn’t reacting only to his atti- 
tude, but to something subtler. 
There was an air of phoniness even 
about his confession of sin. I 
wanted to step outside for some 
clean air, but something about his 
words had caught in my mind, was 
demanding attention. Then I 
hadJt. 

“Have you done any human 
cloning around here?” 

“Yes. Why, do you want to pick 
it up?” He smiled. “I’ll cooper- 
ate. It’s at a village about six kilo- 
meters from here. A ..dull af- 
fair — but one guy there has almost 
a cosmopolitan view.” 

1 heard the sound of horses, 
knew Harlan had arrived. 1 kept 

IF 




my icy attention fixed on the 
generunner. 

“Does the name Delver sound 
familiar?” 

He frowned, searching his mem- 
ory, then, nodded. “Yes. I think 
that was the man who contracted 
the clone. He lived alone. I sup- 
pose he enjoyed the idea of a slave 
that looked like him. Why, have 
you got the clone already?” 

1 nodded woodenly. “I think we 
have. It was found dead this morn- 
ing, supposedly a suicide. Of 
course, they assumed it was Free- 
man Delver himself, but now I 
think that’s doubtful.” 

He nodded gleefully. “So that’s 
what he had in mind. Clever man. 
Really fooled his neighbors, eh? 
What is he, a joker? Or did he just 
want to go away secretly?” 

Harlan ducked in. I ignored him. 
“Yes, he wanted to get away se- 
cretly, Jansen. And you’re in 
trouble. Bad trouble.” 

“For the death of a clone? Uh- 
uh. That battle was fought in 
courts long ago. It may not be legal 
to make them, but 1 can’t be held 
criminally responsible for some- 
one’s killing one I made.” 

I shook my head. “Not the 
clone. You’re accessory to the 
murder of a warranter and theft. 
Your clone made it directly pos- 
sible for the murder to be com- 
mitted, because it gave Delver 
the perfect escape.” 

The tamperer was ho longer

smiling. Disbelief etched his face. 

“You’re joking. Seeker. Aren’t 
you?” 

“I wish I could laugh with you. 
But Delver was clever. And he 
took advantage of your helpful- 
ness. That’s the real danger of your 
kind, Jansen. And that’s why hu- 
man cloning is generally out- 
lawed.” I looked at Harlan then, 
saw another Seeker named Corey 
behind him. “Take him, Harl. 
And be careful — he has some- 
thing to escape from. Log him in 
as accessory to murder, for start- 
ers.” ■ 

Harlan nodded, pulling out his 
laser. Behind him, Corey dupli- 
cated the action, moving around 
to get a clear view of Jansen. 

Harl asked quickly, “What 
about you?” 

“I don’t know. Any starships in 
Grailport?” 

“Three, as far as I know. Two 
freighters and a regular liner.” 

“Scheduled liftoffs?’’ I de- 
manded. 

“The liner’s scheduled for to- 
morrow night. One freighter for 
two days from now. The secotid 
freighter’s a freelance, with no 
schedule.” 

“For hire?” 1 asked. “If a man’s 
.willing to pay a few thousand 
credits?” 

Harlan nodded. “Probably. 
Why?” 

“I’ve got a fugitive who wants to 
get offplanet. Probably as fast as 



33 




possible. And he's got nine thou- 
sand credits on him, plus stolen 
travel papers. He’ll probably try 
for that freighter. He planned 
well, so I’ll b^t he’s on his way to 
the port now.” 

“There’s been no transport 
routing to Grailport for the last 
two days. He must be either on foot 
or riding.” 

I nodded. “With Warrior, it 
would take about ten hours to 
reach Grailport. With a normal 
mount, maybe sixteen or twenty. 
Our man has had since some time 
early this morning, probably.' 
That means he could be almost 
there, if he had spares and dis- 
carded the tired mounts. And from 
the way he’s operated so far. I’d 
bet that’s just what he did.” 

“You’d better contact head- 
quarters in Grailport. They can at 
least get a couple of monitors to 
pick him up.” 

“You reach them, eh, Harl? The 
man’s name is Delver. He’ll look 
normal, because he stole War- 
ranter travel papers. Tell the peo- 
ple to be careful — I don’t know 
what this guy is capable of.” 

T he genefunner grunted. I 
looked at him. “Look, Seeker, 
I didn’t know what this Delver was 
going to try. I mean, a little fun 
with cloning, that I can under- 
stand. But murder, theft. Well — ” 

I swore at him. “You’ve done 
your'damage.” 

34 



He shook his head. “You don’t 
understand. I’m trying to help. 
There’s something you should 
know.” 

“Get to the point if you have 
one.” 

He reddened. “Well, he asked 
for a novelty item, too. And I 
found one he went wild over. A 
Tavarean morphlizard.” He 
gulped. “A programed one, with 
alterations. Input electrodes 
and a hand control unit. The units 
have preset limitations on shape 
changes, but they can be' elim- 
inated in a minute if you know 
what you’re doing. This Delver 
has a handbook on them. And to 
top it, the lizard is programed for 
total loyalty to the owner.” 

I froze; shut my eyes and mind 
against a hurt that flared up 
abruptly. 

I heard Harlan through a haze, 
asking in a puzzled voice, “A 
morphlizard? What is it?” 

From somewhere I got the 
strength to overcome my reflex- 
ive reaction, looked at him sober- 
ly. “The dominant life form of 
Tavare, the second planet of Nov- 
terra’s system. Through some 
evolutionary quirk the lizards 
are capable of altering their 
shape, abilities. Outlawed on any 
other planet because of their dan- 
gerous potential. And this tam- 
perer has given one to Delver.” 

The tamperer broke in nervous- 
ly: “Look, I didn’t know. I thought 

IF 




he was just another ground- 
mucker, maybe a. little more 
sophisticated, but nothing much. 
A modified morphlizard wouldn’t 
be that dangerous to one of these 
muckers. But if he’s the way you 
describe him, well — ” 

He let his voice trail away. 

I left the wagon, unable to stand 
the sight of the fool any longer. 
Harlan followed me out. 

“You leaving now?” 

I glanced at him, shivered. “No. 
I’ll have to contact HQ myself to 
alert them. Suddenly I’m the ex- 
pert.” I grabbed my com, dialed 
Grailport. 

The expert, I thought, a lonely 
terror in my guts. 

After a moment of static a cool 
voice came on: ‘‘Seeker headquar- 
ters, Grailport.” 

‘‘Route me through to Frasier, 
quickest. This is Carver.” 

A hum came as the transfer was 
effected, then my local chief was 
on the circuit. 

‘‘Sir, I’m working on a murder. 
Nothing simple. Involves a tam- 
perer. The killer is on the loose, 
probable heading for Grailport.” 

‘‘Is that all? You want monitors 
to pick him up?” 

‘‘Not unless they can handle 
morphlizards,” I said, fighting 
to keep my voice even. ‘‘The tam- 
perer fixed him up with one. Fully 
adapted. There are controls on the 
lizard’s changes, but they can be 
eliminated easily.” 

TO SEEK ANOTHER 



Frasier swore softly. ‘‘No one 
here has had any experience.” 

He was voicing something 1 al- 
ready knew. The morphlizards 
were rarely seen outsystem. 

Ignoring the yammering fear 
that came bubbling up out of my 
past, I said in a voice drained of 
emotion, ‘‘Then I think it’s my 
job.” 

‘‘No. Not even if he’s threaten- 
ing to destroy Grailport. You 
can’t risk it.” 

His voice held concern. He had 
read my file, knew my back- 
ground. He knew, in effect, why I 
was a Seeker on Sarus, why 1 had 
left Novterra. And he was going 
to protect me if. I’d let him. And 
for a moment I wanted to scream 
yes, jump the first ship outbound. 
But something caught in my gut 
and I knew I couldn’t. 

‘‘Sir, that other experience was a 
long time ago. I’m different — con- 
ditions have changed. And you 
can’t send a totally unprepared 
man against a morphlizard. At 
least I’m somewhat cued In — if 
anyone is.” 

I listened to silence for seconds, 
as he weighed my decision against 
available alternatives. When he 
sighed 1 knew he’d accepted my 
judgment at least temporarily. 

‘‘As you wish. Seeker. What aid 
can I give you?” 

‘‘Put that starport in stasis. Seal 
any ship In port and don’t let any- 
one through. And send a flitter for 

35 




me. I’ll have to get there quickest.” 
”ir your man knows what a 
morphlizard can do seals won't 
hold him forever.” 

VI know that. But he's not an ex- 
pert — he may even be harmless. I 
can’t be sure. In any case, those 
precautions should hold him un- 
til I can get there.” I hesitated. 
‘‘After that it’s up to me.” 

‘‘Right. The Hitter’s on its way 
and I’ll have that port sealed 
tighter than a molectronic lock. 
Contact me when you reach 
Grailport. I’ll check the rest of 
Sarus for experienced men.” 
‘‘Check, sir. Carver out.” I cut 
the channel, left my beacon on to 
guide the flitter to mer Harlan was 
staring at me. 

‘‘What was that all about?” 



I WANTED to turn on my heel, 
walk away. But I forced myself 
to answer — answer as best I could. 

‘‘I was once stationed in 
Tavare,” I said. ‘‘During the 
standard labor draft period. I was a 
maintaintenance tech at a 
virtually automated station. I was 
taking care of a small group of re- 
searchers working at the station. 
There was a girl, Karin. We be- 
came quite close.” I shut my eyes, 
started to relive the incident, as I 
had so many times before. ‘‘One 
day, without warning, there was a 
run of morphlizards. Thousands, 
some of them rather ancient. 



More than any man had ever seen 
before. They overran the station, 
breaking through our external 
security screens as if they were 
paper. It gave the science boys ad- 
ditional clues to liz life cycles 
later, but during that run we just 
retreated to the security room 
of the station and hid. We were 
terrified- from the very first. 
Sontething about a reaction the 
lizards can evoke' in men. Any- 
way, after two days they even got 
past the heavy-duty screens and 
started to trickle through the secu- 
rity room. Half of us died from 
physical wounds and simple fear. 
Naked fear. We still don’t know 
why it happened like that, what 
fates chose the doomed ones. But 
half died and the rest of us were 
raving madmen by the time the 
lizards vanished.” I laughed bit- 
terly. ‘‘And that’s exactly what 
they did. Vanished, almost every 
lizard. Dispersed, back to where 
they came from, almost as if on a 
signal. They left behind a 
wrecked station and shattered 
people.” 

Harlan asked, ‘‘And the 
girl— Karin?” 

‘‘She was one of the dead ones. 
Eventually, rescue teams arrived 
from Novterra. They put the sur- 
vivors in rehab and eventually 
most of us recovered. Sort of. But 
we had to get out of the system. 
The proximity of Tavare was a lit- 
tle too much.” I looked at Harlan, 



36 



IF 




wondered if he really under- 
stood. “You know the worst, Harl? 
What I just told you is just words 
plugged into my memory by 
psych technicians. Everything 
that could flip me again has been 
carefully filtered out of my mind. 
The words left don’t mean any- 
thing— I don’t have the equipment 
left to communicate the reality 
of what happened. I have no way 
of transmitting my real feelings 
to you. Just second-hand phrases 
psych thinks are safe.’’ I laughed. 
“And sometimes I wonder if they 
didn’t leave too much.’’ 

“And now you’re going to face 
another lizard?’’ 

“No choice, Harl.’’ 

“I’ll take your place, Dan. You 
don’t have to risk the contact.’’ 

1 looked at him, wondering if he 
actually realized what he was of- 
fering. And knew he didn’t. I 
couldn’t tell him what it was 
like — though I could have added 
that the scientists knew that the 
lizards could produce a fear re- 
action in men, transmitted by tel- 
epathy, or some other mechanism 
nobody yet understood. And that 
was beside their actual^ physical 
capabilities, which were incred- 
ible. But to say Tnore would have 
been pointless; he still wouldn’t 
have comprehended the reality 
of the lizards. So I just smiled, 
shook my head. 

“I have to try, Harl,’’ I said. 
“And not just because no one else 

TO SEEK ANOTHER 



knows what I know. See, I’ve been 
running from them! The psych peo- 
ple said that was the only way 1 
could insure my sanity.’’ I could 
feel myself trembling. “But I’ve 
merely managed to block the 
insanity off in a corner of my 
mind. And a man shouldn’t live 
like that.” I looked up at the stars 
that were beginning to glow 
through as dusk settled over the 
countryside. ^*We didn’t get here 
by pretending that dangers didn’t 
exist, by hiding from them. Men 
have to face their fears sooner or 
later if they’re going to keep on 
being men. It’s part of our make- 
up.” 

“Are you taking the risk for a 
point of philosophy? Just to prove 
something?” 

I looked at him. “Sort of. To 
prove something to myself. Every- 
body’s got to some time.” 

He nodded soberly. “I suppose. 
Good luck, Dan.” 

F eet scuffled behind us. 1 
turned to confront the tamper- 
ed Jansen. 

“Is there something you want?” 
He nodded. “Yes, something I’d 
like to do. That morphliz- 
ard — well, I know how dangerous 
it can be. And maybe I could help 
you a little.” 

I looked at him more closely. 
His attitude seemed to have 
changed and this one rang a little 
truer than the previous facade. 



37 




“How?” 

“Fve read the research reports 
on them. It’s possible to freeze 
their polymorphic structure 
temporarily. There’s an organic 
substance from Tavare that will 
do so if it makes contact in suf- 
ficient quantity. I think it orig- 
inates from a biological enemy of 
the morphlizards. It’s the nat- 
ural evolutionary reaction to 
their power. A balance. And I 
think I can make some for you.” 

I felt sudden hope flare within 
me, hated it. Overcoming the 
paralysis, I demanded, “What 
range?” 

“The reaction depends on 
amount of contact. -For- example, 
most of a dose of about ten 
milliliters would have to hit the 
target squarely. And I’m afraid the 
stuff will have, to be thrown. The 
sudden impact of its being fired 
from any sort of projectile 
weapon would conceivably start a 
decomposition reaction.” 

Throw it. With human inaccu- 
racy, you’d have to be close to be 
sure. Well within the range of t|ie 
lizard’s fear-evoking ability. All 
of which meant it was still my job. 
I looked at him once more. 

“How long will it take you to 
prepare it?” 

He shrugged. “Maybe a half- 
hour. | can do it right now, if you’ll 
let me.” 

I nodded. “Let’s go.” I followed 
him into the wagon. He stepped 

38 



toward the lab section, began 
swinging equipment out into the 
open. He grabbed a tape, inserted 
it into a small viewer. Frowning, 
he began to manipulate the 
equipment. It was mostly auto- 
matic, programing the addition 
of chemicals to a nutrient broth, 
maintaining a certain temper- 
ature and pressure, checking con- 
taminants. 

Abruptly he began to speak, 
without looking at me. 

“Actually, there are two coun- 
teragents for the polymorphic 
ability. The one I’m working on is 
the venom of the guredu. You’ve 
heard of it?” 

I nodded vaguely. “Ranks 
among the most dominant species 
on the planet. A reptile — and in 
partial competition with the 
morphlizards.” 

“Essentially correct. They spit 
their venom accurately up to about 
five meters. Rather astonishing. 
But that’s the only reason they can 
exist in competition with the 
lizards. That’s true for every 
competing species. For instance, 
there’s a small mammal similar to 
the Terran rodents. The lizards 
can’t harm it. At first researchers 
suspected some fort of scent, but 
experiment eliminated that pos- 
sibility. So now they’re working 
on a theory of telepathic defense. 
They think the rodent can freeze 
the lizard’s changing ability by 
controlling its mind. The hypoth- 

IF 




esis is borne out by examination 
of the mammal’s brain. It has cer- 
tain structural peculiarities. Any- 
way, it goes that way all along the 
ecological spectrum. What 
Tavare’s evolution produced, it 
also found defenses for.” He 
smiled. “We can duplicate this 
venom, but nowhere n^ar as hand- 
ily as the guredu makes it. And 
there’s another agent we can’t 
quite duplicate. It’s a glandular 
secretion of the lizard. Right up 
to maturity this secretion is pres- 
ent, preventing any polymorphism. 
But at maturity, the glands re- 
sponsible start dying and the poly- 
morphism comes in. In fact, one 
can use that point to define ma- 
turity.” 

“You don’t sound like a tam- 
pered” I said. “You sound more 
like a researcher!” 



Ill 

H e finished a detail, spun 
to glare at me. “I’m not. I 
don’t have the ability. I found that 
out long ago. I can understand — 
but not create. So forget it!” 

His vehemence surprised me and 
I realized I had touched a sore 
point. I smiled, trying to soothe 
him. “All right. But there’s teach- 
ing, you know. The more you say, 
the more I think you don’t belong 
here, tampering for fun.” 

He turned back to his work. 



“They don’t use teachers any more. 
A computer makes a memory 
scan of some great scientist, and a 
reaction tape — then simulates his 
form. It and others like it do all the 
teaching, over vidcoms. There’s 
no place for humans in the prqc- 
ess. 

1 considered his words, then said 
softly, “Maybe not on the central 
worlds. But here we still use hu- 
man teachers. And 1 can name a 
dozen other worlds that do. May- 
be not as advanced as your tech- 
planets, but moving along nicely. 
And if we’re too primitive here, 
Novterra also uses men. There’s a 
place for a person who wants one.” 

He was concentrating on the lab 
equipment. I wasn’t sure whether 
he’d heard me or not. He finished 
punching out a programing com- 
bination for his lab computer, 
then turned away. 

“The rest is automatic.” I fol- 
lowed him out of the wagon. He 
stepped outside, looked around. 
He spoke to the countryside but 
his words were directed at me. 
“What are you, a psych-tech? Are 
you just trying to torture me? 
Damn it, I gave up fantasies too 
long ago to start swallowing them 
now.” 

“I meant what I said. Safus can 
use intelligent men. Almost any 
outworld can.” I paused. “And 
you might find that your creativity 
is better here. There’s something 
about the tech worlds, about their

crowdedness, their hectic pace, 
that bothers some men. It's as if 
some men adapted to the tech civi- 
lization as it developed — and 
others didn't and have had to leave 
it really to achieve. I'm not making 
promises. But if you’re not a tam- 
perer at heart, consider the possi- 
bilities. A good word from a 
Seeker can do wonders." 

He looked at me and his cyni- 
cism was gone. 

‘‘I’ll think about it. Seeker. 
Thanks for the offer." 

He stepped off into the dark- 
ness. 1 should have followed a tam- 
pered made sure he didn't attempt 
to escape. But I didn't think this 
one would. I turned back to the 
wagon, found Harlan staring at 
me, a strange smile on his face. 

“Do you think I should follow 
him?" I demanded. 

He shook his head. “1 think you 
found a chink in his armor. Maybe 
you should go into rehab work." 

I laughed. “A Seeker is trained 
to handle difficulties, Harl." 

“Of course. I wasn't criticizing 
you, Dan. I wish I could do as 
much for a tamperer. If s sure bet- 
ter than just deporting them." He 
frowned. “About this morphliz- 
ard. Can it actually change 
shape?" 

Oh, damn, can it! But I kept my 
voice calm. “Yeah. The research- 
ers didn't believe it at first either. 
But there's documented proof." 
Besides my personal experience. 



“It can even increase its mass to a 
certain extent by absorbing 
organic compounds and simple 
molecules from the atmosphere. 
That's one reason for the intense 
interest in it. If we could dupli- 
cate its synthesizing abilities 
we'd make a big jump over current 
techniques. But the secret is noth- 
ing solely structural — something 
in the lizard’s entire physiologi- 
cal system enables it to change. A 
dead morphlizard is just a hunk of 
decaying protoplasm, with perhaps 
a greater percentage of undiffer- 
entiated cells than most creatures. 
It’s a mystery that we can’t solve 
yet." As usual, a question in the 
right area had triggered the dry 
lecture; it was a means of psycho- 
logical defense, the psych-techs 
said. They were probably right. 

“You sound as if you remem- 
ber quite a bit about them." 

“Just what the research team 
learned before the incident," I 
snapped at him. “Oh, hell, Harl, 
I’m sorry. But I’ve completely 
avoided the subject for some time. 
That was part of the intended re- 
hab program." 

“Okay, Dan." After a moment 
he asked softly, “Before that in- 
cident, what job were you heading 
for?" 

I shrugged. “Biological research. 
But they decided afterward that it 
was better to dissociate myself 
completely from the previous life. 
It was only by a narrow margin 



40 



IF 




that they decided it was safe to let 
me keep my memories.” 

“So you became a Seeker on 
Sarus?” 

“That’s what my psych prorde 
indicated was a good alternative. 
And Sarus was far enough away to 
let me forget. Although sometimes 
1 wish they had wiped my mem- 
ories. 

“And let you start over? What 
was that you gave me about men 
facing their dangers, not hiding 
from them?” 

' I laughed bitterly. “Maybe it 
was just hot air. I think most men 
would rather erase a problem than 
face it — if they could.” 

“But we don’t evolve that way, 
eh?” 

He was goading me, and I recog- 
nized the fact. And I suddenly re- 
alized why. 

“Maybe you should go into re- 
hab,” I commented dryly. 

A n alarm rang from within 
the wagon. Jansen appeared 
out of the night and we entered the 
vehicle together. He took four 
cubes from the apparatus, handed 
them to me. 

“One’ll do the job. Press the stud 
and throw it. They’re contact ex- 
plosion cubes. When they hit, the 
cube will shatter and spread the 
agent around. That way even a 
near miss might slow the lizard 
down. Hopefully, with four you’ll 
have an adequate safety margin.” 

TO SEEK ANOTHER 



I stared at the cubes for a few 
seconds, then dropped them into a 
pocket. “One cube will do the 
job?” 

“Yes. A full dose will freeze its 
polymorphic ability and paralyze 
•t” 

.1 thought of facing a lizard, de- 
pending on those four small cubes, 
and shuddered. “Are you sure 
these will work?” 

He returned my glance. “The 
venom works. Seeker. If the syn- 
thesis is accurate it will freeze the 
lizard. Otherwise I can’t promise 
anything. If you don’t trust me — ” 
he let it trail off, then smiled thinly. 
“I guess I can’t blame you if you 
don’t. But I think the synthesis was 
good and that the stuff will work.” 

“That’s good enough. After all, 
venom or not, I have to face the liz- 
ard.” 

A shrill whine rose outside, 
growing louder until it culminated 
in the thump of the flitter setting 
down. I stepped out, started to 
walk to it, paused to look back. 

“Jansen, want to come along?” 

He looked surprised. Then; “I’d 
like to.” 

Harlan said, “I’ll come along, 
too. Corey can handle the situation 
here, wait for the pick-up van. All 
right with you?” 

I smiled. “Sure, why not? I can 
use all the support I can get.” 

I T WAS well into the night by 
the time the flitter reached 



41 




Grailport. Patterns of light beck- 
oned us to the ground below. Off 
to jone side of the city was a dark 
area, one that usually was alive 
with lights and activity. But the 
starport had been sealed off, as I 
requested. The flitter homed on the 
signal that Frasier was casting for 
us— he’d gone into the field to 
handle the coordination of this 
task. We swooped down and I 
recognized the warehouse area 
outside the perimeter of the port. 
As I stepped out of the flitter, 
Frasier walked up. 

“Hello, Carver.” 

“Hello, sir.” 

“We caught him coming into the 
city. A couple of rni?nitprs tried to 
pick him up, against orders.” 
“What happened?” 

The chief shook his head. “One 
is dead and the other is under se- 
dation — in the hands of the psych 
lads. The freeman knows how to 
use the lizard fully, it appears. We 
managed to corner him in this 
warehouse when he couldn’t get 
through the screens around the 
port. We’ve got him screened in 
now.” 

“It’s only a matter of time until 
he finds out what a lizard can do to 
a defensive screen. And then 
there’ll be no choice. We’ll have to 
destroy him and the lizard.” 1 
swallowed quickly. “And the only 
sure way is a nuke. Anything less 
the lizard will handle.” 

“You intend to go in there?” 



“Yes, sir.” 

He considered. Then: ‘T sup- 
pose it’s worth the risk. But you’re 
taking a man in with you.” 

I looked at him, knew he was de- 
cided on this. But I had to try. 
“Chief, it’s too dangerous. To 
throw in a man who’s had no ex- 
perience with a lizard is insane.” 

His eyes were hard, unyielding. 
“I’m not known for being insane. 
Carver,” he rasped. “And I’m not 
going to risk your going in there 
alone. What makes you think your 
experience gives you any immuni- 
ty? I’ve thought it over— and I’ve 
checked with psych. And they say 
just the opposite will be true, if 
anything. How do you know you 
won’t freeze up, become a mad- 
man again at the first contact with 
the lizard?” 

I could feel myself flushing, but I 
didn’t know whether from anger or 
shame. I choked down an angry re- 
tort. “All right, if that’s the way 
you feel. Who’s going with me?” 
“Since Harlan’s here, he’ll go.” 
We both looked at him, watched 
the surprise flash across his face. 
Then grimness replaced it. 

“Good,” he said. “I’ll go in with 
you.” 

He was sorry, that much was ob- 
vious. But so was I. Anybody who 
hadn’t felt the impact of a lizard 
couldn’t begin to understand what 
it was like. Not even the psych 
teams. It was impossible to com- 
municate the reality. None of them 

IF 



42 




really understood what Harlan 
would be walking into. 

Then a monitor was standing be- 
fore me, holding out a survival suit. 
The chief coughed. “These might 
be able to protect you from some of 
the physical danger.” 

W E BOTH knew the futility of 
the precaution. The lizard 
could come up with a transforma- 
tion that would cut through the 
suit like plastic. And even then 
the physical danger was the lesser 
evil, i didn’t know exactly what 
effect a single lizard would have 
on a man, except that one moni- 
tor had been hurt mentally. But 
any uncertainty didn’t harbor 
good possibilities as far as I could 
see. I found my hand , drifting to- 
ward the blaster that hung at the 
belt of the survival suit, jerked it 
away. I looked at Harlan. 

“Harl, no matter what, don’t kill 
Delver if that lizard is still loose.” 
“Why not?’.’ 

“Because at present it’s bonded 
to him by implanted loyalty re- 
stricting it. Delver is a limiting 
factor. Without him the lizard 
could be even worse.” I turned 
away, glanced at the chief. “If we 
don’t come out soon you’ll know 
we failed. This’Ij either be done fast 
or not at all.” 

“I know. And Carver — ” 

I looked back. 

“Don’t you think you should 
give half those cubes to Harlan?” 

TO SEEK ANOTHER 



I looked at him for an eternity, 
then nodded woodenly. I reached 
into my pocket, pulled out the 
cubes and gave Harlan two. “Use 
them carefully. They’re the best 
chance we’ve got.” 

“I know,” he said. 

But did he really? Few men can 
truly accept helplessness against an 
animal when full precautions have 
been taken. I turned away, 
motioned for Harlan to follow me. 

We approached the warehouse, a 
towering building that stretched 
five stories into the night sky, 
totally enclosed by the protective 
screens Frasier had erected. I held 
the blaster in my left hand, a cube 
in my right and signaled for the 
Seekers to cut the screens and let 
us enter. Frasier gave us a thumbs- 
up and a faint odor of ozone came 
as the screens blinked off. We ran 
forward, through the open doors 
to the warehouse, and felt the 
screens snapping on behind us, as 
closely timed as possible. 

I glanced at Harlan, saw him 
studying the inferior:' ' 
“Remember,” 1 cautioned him, 
“it’s not a standard capture. Try 
for paralysis; Only use the blaster if 
you have to. Take care.” 

“You, too, Dan.” 

The interior was dark, and I had 
no idea where fhe controls were, so 
I switched onto infrared scanning 
with the suit. Not as good as vis- 
ual, but better than being blind. 
Containers were stacked iii rows 



43 




throughout the warehouse. At the 
center, the open space extended 
to the ceiling, past levels of cargo 
storage, with a cargo lift dimly 
visible at the top. 

I paused and decided to risk re- 
vealing our whereabouts; it would 
take too long to search the entire 
place. 

“Delver,” I called out. “Come 
on out and surrender. This isn’t go- 
ing to do you any good.’ ’ 

Nothing happened at first. Then 
an eerie cry echoed through the 
building. 

P ANIC started to rise in me. I 
felt myself freezing up, then I 
saw the dark form ‘arrowing out 
of the upper reaches of the build- 
ing, resembling a Saran dart bird 
enlarged five times. Waves of 
fear rolled across me, set up sym- 
pathetic vibrations that shook me 
to the core. I stood facing the 
naked core of truth. I couldn’t 
fight the lizard! 

I forced my head around, saw 
that Harlan was on his knees. His 
blaster lay forgotten on the floor 
and the cubes had vanished. The 
stink of the terror within me trig- 
gered buried memories, scenes 
from the past. God, the scenes! I 
saw Karin again, kneeling, falling, 
her face filled with madness. I saw 
her die again, looking to me for 
help, saw her form being ripped 
apart by the hordes of lizards that 
had overrun the station. She had 



died hours before — what they 
were destroying was the mindless 
hulk that remained. But still 1 
shouted and cried. She was mine! 
They had no right! I could feel the 
last vestige of reason being torn 
out of my soul, feel the pain, the 
cancerous fear eating at my gut. 
Nightmares? 

Yes, nightmares! Shapes, all the 
shapes of the Lord of Creation — 
but all with the same soul. The soul 
of fear, the soul of the lizard! 

Then the real/present lizard 
struck, slicing through the 
protective suit and tracing a cut 
along my arm. The past vanished 
and I saw the lizard/dart bird 
sweep up into the darkness once 
more. And suddenly I was en- 
raged, maddened by the existence 
of the creature that had taken 
Karin away and driven me from 
my home. No matter that the 
creature was different; his soul 
was the same. My rage fought my 
fear and overwhelmed it. I was not 
sane but I did not fear — a weird, 
berseker state possessed me. I 
looked down, saw the blaster I’d 
dropped. Stooping, I gathered it 
into my grasp once more. 

I groped along the suit belt, 
pulled out a set of flares. 
Triggering them, I tossed them 
high into the air, where they 
hovered on antigrav devices, 
spilling light into the darkness. I 
switched from infrared to visual 
and looked at Harlan for help, but

IF 




he still kneeled on the floor. I dis- 
missed him from my mind and 
looked for the damned lizard 
again. I caught sight of it, wheel- 
ing in great arcs above my head. I 
kneeled, took careful aim, and 
fired the blaster. Energy cut 
through the air, searing at the liz- 
ard’s form. With knother enraged 
cry, it dropped toward me. 

I fought to keep the blaster 
trained on it, and the bird started 
to burn. I’d won the first battle. 
The lizard shimmered, trans- 
formed itself into a form immune 
to blaster fire. But the creature 
was not basically intelli- 
gent — and the new form could not 
fly. It plummeted toward the 
ground, still bathed in the blaster’s 
discharge. At the last moment it 
adapted to the< dual threat and 
shimmered into a new form. It 
hovered scant meters above the 
ground, a large flying reptile with 
glistening scales that shed blaster 
fire with little damage. 

T hen it was on the ground and 
I cut off the blaster. It shim- 
mered into a new form, a mere 
five meters away. Convulsively I 
triggered a cube, threw it. The pro- 
jectile hit the floor near the crea- 
ture and exploded, scattering ven- 
om onto the lizard, which uttered 
a cry of pain and charged at me, 
shimmering again. The transfor- 
mation took longer, seemed 
forced; the venom was taking ef- 



fect. I recognized the new form; 
a Tavarean marsh lion, huge, 
muscled and full of claws. I threw 
my second cube as it neared me; it 
hit the lizard squarely and the 
venom splashed across it. 
Screaming again, ft kept on 
charging, moving clumsily. I fired 
at it and it started to shimmer, 
but more slowly still. 

It was a bare two meters away 
when it finished and the lion was 
still there, but with gleaming, 
blaster-proof scales. It jumped at 
me, claws extended, and I swung 
away from it awkwardly. I dove at 
Harlan, knocking him over and 
fighting to get his cubes. I came 
up with one. I spun around to face 
the next charge and was bowled 
over and carried past Harlan’s 
form by the beast. With savage 
glee, I grabbed to hang on, stuck 
my hand down the gaping jaws and 
triggered the cube. The teeth rip- 
ped my hand as I started to with- 
draw and then the venom took ef- 
fect. 

Gradually, almost comically, the 
life went out of the lizard. It top- 
pled over in slow motion. I shov^ 
it off me, stood up and felt the sear- 
ing heat of a blaster beam slice past 
•me. I fell, rolling aside and scram- 
bling for my blaster. With one mo- 
tion I had it, aimed it and trig- 
gered it. Delver’s hand vanished, a 
second later, his weapon with it. 

Somehow I managed to keep 
from turning the beam onto his 



TO SEEK ANOTHER 



45 




head, totally destroying him. In- 
stead, as he crumpled, I turned it 
on the lizard once more. And 
burned it, even against the 
protection of the adapted scales. 
When 1 was through it was just a 
burning mass of dead proto- 
plasm, framed in a scorched pit in 
the floor. I stared at it and 
strangely felt something missing. 
My gaze wandered over to Har- 
lan — he had lost consciousness 
during our brief struggle, but 
seemed intact. And then I realized 
what was missing. When I had 
turned the blaster on the lizard, 
finishing it, I had finished 
burning the fear out of me, with- 
out realizing it. £ven the core of 
Insanity that had lingered over the 
years was gone. 

I thought, of Karin and felt pain. 
But the pain I could bear, with the 
cushion of the reality of the 
present. I dropped the blaster, 
looked back, at Delver, saw him 
lying on the floor. No bleeding; 
the blaster cauterized its own 
wound. Just a large part of his arm 
missing and he was in shock. I felt 
no pity, instead a kind of joy that I 
knew was alien to the principles 
of the Seekers. But it was good that 
Delver lay there, and not some in- 
nocent clone of him, like the one 
that had died to start this whole af- 
fair. 

I turne<iaway, stumbled toward, 
the door and signaled for the 
Seekers to open up the screens. I 

46 



faced Frasier with a slight grin on 
my face, knew it was ridiculous. I 
walked into his arms. 

“You were wrong. I got it, and 
Delver too. Harlan’s in there, un- 
conscious. I got the lizard. You 
were wrong — and the psych boys 
too. Wrong.’’ 

He didn’t seem upset at his mis- 
take — instead he looked quite joy- 
ful. I pondered on it as I collapsed 
into his arms, facing the darkness 
without fear. 

S OMEHOW it’s all over. My 
collapse was simply a combina- 
tion of the lizard’s venom and the 
psychological after-effects of the 
battle. I was out of medical care 
inside of a day. So was Harlan. 

Jansen was waiting too. He 
didn’t mention it, but 1 
remembered our conversation. I’m 
going to speak for him at the trial 
and he’ll probably get off lightly. 
As 1 said, we need teachers out 
here. 

And Seekers, too. Who are 
trained to handle difficulties. In the 
end, even our own. •

((¥ N THE, tracks of our spiritu- 
• 1 - al father John Henderson we 
may now have trailed a clutch of 
ABSMs to their lair,” the eminent 
scientist Arpad Arkabarana was 
saying in his rattling voice. “And 
that lair may . not be a mountain 
thicket or rain forest or swamp, 
but these scrimpy.red clay flats. I 
would give my life for the success 
of this quest, but it seems that such 
sacrifice should have a more mag- 
nificent setting.” 

“It looks like a wild goose 
chase,” the eminent scientist Willy 



McGilly commented. But no, Wil- 
ly was not downgrading their quest. 
He was referring lo the wild geese 
that rose about them from the 
sedges of the flats with clatter and 
whistle and honk. This was a flight- 
way, a chase of theirs. There were 
hundreds of them if one had the 
fine eyes to pick them out from the 
backgroumi. “Mud Geese,” Willy 
said. “We don’t see as many of 
them as when I was a boy.” 

“I do not, and i am afraid that I 
will not, believe in the ABSMs,” 
said the eminent scientist Dr. Veli- 



47 






kof Vonk, stroking his — (no he 
didn’t, he didn’t have one) — strok- 
ing his jaw, “and yet this is the 
thing that I also have most desired, 
to find this missing link finally, and 
to refute all believers in the other 
thing.” 

“We can’t see the chain for the 
links,” said Willy McGilly. “I nev- 
er believed any of them were miss- 
ing. There have always been too 
many of them for the length of the 
chain. That’s the trouble.” ^ 

“I’ve traveled a million miles in 
search of them,” said Arpad. “I’ve 
pretty well probed all the meager 
ribs of the world in that travel. My 
fear has always been that I’d miss 
them by a trick — or that in some 
unaccountable "^ay I wouldn’t 
know them when I found them. It 
would be ironic if we did find them 
in such a place as this — not a wild 
place, only a shabby and over- 
looked place.” 

“My own fear has been that 
when I finally gazed on one I would 
wake with a start and find that I 
had been looking in a mirror,” 
said Velikof. “There must be some 
symbolism here that I don’t under- 
stand. What is your own anticipa- 
tion of them, Willy?” 

“Oh, coming back to people I’ve 
always liked. There used to be a 
bunch of them on the edge of my 
home town,” Willy McGilly said. 
“Come to think of it, there used 
to be a bunch of them on the edge 
of every home town. Now they’re 
more likely to be found right in 



the middle of 'every town. They’re 
the scrubs, you know, for the bot- 
toming of the breed.” 

“What are you talking about, 
Willy?” Arpad asked sharply. 

What they were all talking about 
was ABSMs. 

E very town in the south part 
of that county has a shadow 
or secondary. There is Meehan, 
and Meehan Corners; Perkins, and 
Perkins Corner; Boomer, and 
Boomer Flats. The three eminent 
scientists were driving the three 
miles from Boomer to Boomer 
Flats looking for the bones and 
hopefully even the living flesh of a 
legend. It was that of the missing 
link, of the Abominable Snow- 
man, the ABSM. It wasn’t snowy 
country there, but the so-called 
Snowmen have been reported in 
every sort of climate and country- 
side. 

The local legend, recently un- 
covered by Arpad, was that a non- 
African non-Indian “people of 
color” was living in the neighbor- 
hood of Boomer Flats — between 
the sand-bush thickets and the riv- 
er. It was said that they lived on 
the very red mudbanks of the riv- 
er and that they lived a little in the 
river itself. 

Then Dr. Velikof Vonk had 
come onto a tape in a bunch of 
anthropological tapes, and the 
tape contained sequences like this: 
“What do they do wheh the riv- 
er floods?” 



48 



IF 




“Ah, they close their noses and 
mouths and ears with mud and 
they lie down with big rocks on 
their breasts and stay there till the 
flood has passed.” 

“Can they be taught?” 

“Some of the children go to 
school, and they learn. But when 
they are older then they stay at 
home, and they forget.” 

“What sort of language do they 
talk?” 

“Ah, they don’t seem to talk 
very much. They keep to them- 
selves. Sometimes when they talk 
it is just plain Cimarron Valley 
English.” 

“What do they eat?” 

“They boil river water in mud 
clay pots. They put in wild onions 
and greenery. The pottage thick- 
ens then, I don’t know how. It gets 
lumps of meat or clay in it, and 
they eat that too. They eat frogs 
and fish and owls and thicket fila- 
ments. But mostly they don’t eat 
very much of anything.” 

“It is said that they aren’t all of 
the same appearance. It is even 
said that they are born, ah, shape- 
less, and that — ah — could you tell 
me anything about that?” 

“Yeah. They’re born without 
much shape. Most of them never 
do get much shape. When they 
have any, well actually their moth- 
ers lick them into shape, give them 
their appearance.” 

“It’s an old folk tale that bears 
do that.” 

“Maybe they learned it from the 



bears then, young fellow. There’s 
quite a bit of bear mixture in 
them, but the bears themselves 
have nearly gone from the flats 
and thickets now. More than like- 
ly the bears learned it from them. 
Sometimes the mothers lick the 
cubs into the shape of regular peo- 
ple for a joke.” 

“That is the legend?” 

“You keep saying' legend. I 
don’t know anything *about legend. 
I just tell you what you ask me. 
I’ll tell you a funny one, though. 
One of the mothers who was get- 
ting ready to bear happened to get 
hold of an old movie magazine 
that some fishers from Boorner 
had left on the river edge. There 
was a picture in it of the prettiest 
girl that anyone ever saw and it 
was a picture' of all of that girl. 
This mother was tickled by that 
picture. She bore a daughter and 
she licked her into the shape and 
appearance of the girl in the movie 
magazine. And the girl grew up 
looking like that and she still 
looks like that, pretty as a picture. 
I don’t believe the girl appreciates 
the joke. She is the prettiest of all 
the people, though. Her name is 
Crayola Catfish.” 

“Are you having me, old fel- 
low? Have those creatures any 
humor?” 

“Some of them tell old jokes. 
John Salt tells old jokes. The Lic- 
orice Man tells really old jokes. 
And man, does the Comet ever tell 
old jokes!” 



BOOMER FLATS

“Are the creatures long-lived?" 
“Long-lived as we want to be. 
The elixir comes from these flats, 
you know. Some of us use it, some 
of us don't." 

“Are you one of the creatures?" 
“Sure, I’m one of them. I like 
to get out from it sometimes 
though. I follow the harvests." 

T his tape (recorded by an an- 
thropology student at State 
University who; by the way, has 
since busted out of anthropology 
and is now taking hotel and res- 
taurant management) had greatly 
excited the eminent scientist Dr. 
Velikof Vonk when he had played 
it, along with several hundred oth- 
er tapes thatHiad come in that 
week from the anthropology cir- 
cuit. He scratched his — (no he 
didn’t, he didn’t have one) — he 
scratched his jowl and he phoned 
the eminent scientists Arpad Arka- 
barananand Willy McGilly. 

“I’ll go. I’ll go, of course I’ll 
go," Arpad had cried. “I've trav- 
eled a million miles in search of it, 
and should I refuse to go sixty? 
This won’t be it, this can’t be it, 
but I’ll never give up. Yes, we’ll go 
tomorrow." 

“Sure, I’ll go," Willy McGilly 
had said. “I’ve been there before, 
I kind of like those folks on the 
Flats. I don’t know about the big- 
gest catfish in the world, but ahe 
biggest catfish stories in the world 
have been pulled out of the Cimar- 
ron River right about at Boomer 



Flats. Sure, we’ll go tomorrow." 

“This may be it," Velikof had 
said. “How can we miss it? I can 
almost reach out and scratch it on 
the nose from here." 

“You’ll find yourself scratching 
your own nose, that’s how you’ll 
miss it. But it’s there and it’s 
real." 

“I believe, Willy, that there is a 
sort of amnesia which has pre- 
vented us finding them or remem- 
bering them accurately." 

“Not that, Velikof. It’s just that 
they’re always too close to us to 
see." 

So the next day the three emi- 
nent scientists drove over from T- 
Town to come to Boomer Flats. 
Willy McGilly knew where the 
place was, but his pointing out of 
the way seemed improbable and 
Velikof was mor^ inclined to trust 
the information of people in 
Boomer. 

There was a difficulty. People 
kept saying, “This is Boomer. 
There isn’t exactly any place called 
Boomer Flats." Boomer Flats 
wasn’t on any map. It was too 
small even to have a post office. 
And the Boomer people were ex- 
asperating in not knowing about it 
or knowing the way to it. 

“Three miles from here, and 
you don’t know where it is?" Veli- 
kof asked one of them angrily. 

“I don’t even know that it is," 
the Boomer man had said in his 
own near anger. “I don’t believe 
that there is such a place." 



50 



IF 




Finally, however, other men 
told the eminent scientists that 
there sort of was such a place, 
sort of a place. Sort of a road go- 
ing to it too. They pointed out the 
same improbable way that Willy 
McGilly had pointed out. 

The three eminents took the 
road. The flats hadn’t flooded 
lately. The road was sand, but it 
could be negotiated. They came to 
the towii, to the sort of town, in the 
ragged river flats. There was such 
a place. They went to the Cimar- 
ron Hotel which was like any hotel 
anywhere, only older. They went 
into the dining room for it was 
noon. 

It had tables, but it was more 
than a dining room. It was a com- 
mon room. It even had intima- 
tions of old elegance in Uued pier 
mirrors. There was a dingy bar. 
There was a pool table, and a hairy 
man was playing rotation with 
the Comet on it. The Comet was a 
long gray-bearded man (in fact, 
comet means a star with a beard) 
and small pieces were always fall- 
ing off him. Clay-colored men 
with their hats on were playing 
dominos at several of the tables, 
and half a dozen dogs were in the 
room. Something a little queer 
and primordial about those dogs! 
Something^ a little queer and pri- 
mordial about the whole place! 

But, as if set to serve as 
distraction, a remarkably pretty 
girl was there. She might have been 
a waitress. She seemed to be wait- 



ing, either listlessly or thoughtful- 
ly, for something. 

Dr. Velikof Vonk twinkled his 
deep eyes in their orbital caves. 
Perhaps he cogitated his massive 
brain behind his massive orbital 
ridges and he arrived, by sheer 
mentality, at the next step. 

“Have you a menu, young 
lady?” he asked. 

“No,”, she answered simply, but 
it wasn’t simple at all. Her voice 
didn’t go with her prettiness. It 
was much more intricate than her 
appearance, even in that one syl- 
lable. It was powerful, not really 
harsh, deep and resonant as cav- 
erns, full and timejess. The girl 
was big-boned beneath her pretti- 
ness, with heavy brindled hair and 
complex eyes. 

“We would like something to 
eat,” Arpad Arkabaranan ven- 
tured. “What do you have?” 

“They’re fixing it for you now,” 
the girl said. “I’ll bring it after a 
while.” 

There was a rich river smell 
about the whole place, and the 
room was badly lit. 

“Her voice is an odd one,” 
Arpad whispered in curious 
admiration. “Like rocks roiled 
around by water, but it also has a 
touch of springtime in it, spring- 
time of a very peculiar quality.” 

“Not just a springtime; it’s an 
interstadial time,” Willy McGilly 
stated accurately. “I’ve noticed 
that about them in other places. 
It’s old green season in their voices. 



BOOMER FLATS 



51 




green season between the ice.” 

The room was lit only by 
hanging lamps. They had a flicker 
to them. They were not electric. 

‘There’s a lot of the gaslight era 
in this place,” Arpad gave the 
opinion, “but the lights aren’t gas- 
lights either.” 

“No, they’re hanging oil lamps,” 
Velikof said. “An amusing fancy 
just went through my head that 
they might be old whale-oil 
lamps.” 

“Girl, what do you burn in the 
hanging lamps?” Willy McGilly 
asked her. 

“Catfish oil,” she said in the 
resonant voice that had a touch of 
the green interstadial time in it. 
And catfish oil bums with a clay- 
colored flame. 

“Can you bring us drinks while 
we wait?” Velikof of the massive 
head asked. 

“They’re fixing them for you 
now,” the girl said. “I’ll bring them 
after a while.” 

Meanwhile on the old pool table 
the Comet was beating the hairy 
man at rotation. Nobody could 
beat the Comet at rotation. 

“We came here looking for 
strange creatures,” Arpad said in 
the direction of the girl. “Do you 
know anything about strange crea- 
tures or people, or where they can 
be found?” 

“Yoii are the only strange people 
who have come here lately,” she 
told them. Then she brought their 
drinks to them, three great slosh- 



ing clay cups or bulbous steins 
that smelled strongly of river, per- 
haps of interstadial river. She set 
them in front of the eminents with 
something like a twinkle in her 
eyes — something like, but much 
more. It was laughing lightning 
flashing from under the ridges of 
that pretty head. She was waiting 
their reaction. 

Velikof cocked a big deep eye at 
his drink. This itself was a feat. 
Other men hadn’t such eyes, or 
such brows above them, as had 
Velikof Vonk. They took a bit of 
cocking, and it wasn’t done light- 
ly. And Velikof grinned out of 
deep folk memory as he began to 
drink. Velikof was always strong 
on the folk memory bit. 

Arpad Arkabaranan screamed, 
rose backwards, toppled his chair, 
and stood aghast while pointing a 
shaking finger at his splashing 
clay cup. Arpad was disturbed. 

* Willy McGilly drank deeply 
from his own stirring vessel. 

“Why, it’s Green Snake Snort- 
er!” he cried in amazement and 
delight. “Oh, drink of drinks, 
thou art pleasure beyond expec- 
tation! They used to serve it to us 
back home,- but I never even hoped 
to find it here. What great thing 
have we done to deserve this?” 

He drank again of the wonderful 
splashing liquor while the spray of 
it filled the air. And Velikof also 
drank with noisy pleasure. The 
girl righted Arpad’s chair, put 
Arpad into it again with strong 



52 



IF 




hands, and addressed him power- 
fully to his cresting breaker. But 
Arpad was scared of his lively 
drink. “It’s alive, it’s alive,’’ was all 
that he could jabber. Arpad Arka- 
baranan specmlized in primi- 
tives, and primitives by definition 
are prime stuff. But there wasn’t, 
now in his moment oC weakness, 
enough prime stuff in Arpad him- 
self to face so pleasant and primi- 
tive a drink as this. 

The liquid was sparkling with 
bright action, was adequately 
alcoholic, something like bock 
beer, and there was a green snake 
in each cup. (Velikof in his note- 
book states that they were green 
worms of the species vermis ebrius 
viridis, but that is only a quibble. 
They were snake-like worms and of 
the size of small snakes, and we 
will call them snakes.) 

“Do get with it, Arpad,’’ Willy 
McGilly cried. “The trick is to 
drink it up before the snake drinks 
it. I tell you though that the snakes 
Can discern when a mail is afraid 
of them. They’ll fang the face off a 
man who’s afraid of them.’’ 

“Ah, I don’t believe that I want 
the drink,’’ Arpad declared with 
sickish grace. “I’m not much of a 
drinking man.’’ 

So Arpad’s green snake drank 
up his Green Snake Snorter, nois- 
ily and greedily. Then it ex- 
pired — it breathed out its life and 
evaporated. That green snake was 
gone. 

“Where did he go?” Arpad 



asked nervously. He was still un- 
easy about the business. 

“Back to the catfish,’’ the girl 
said. “All the snakes are spirits of 
catfish just out for a little ram- 
ble.’’ 

“Interesting,” Velikof said, and 
he noted in his pocket notebook 
that the vermis ebrius viridis is not 
a discrete species of worm or 
snake, but is rather spirit of cat- 
fish. It is out of such* careful nota- 
tion that science is built up. 

“Is there anything noteworthy 
about Boomer Flats?” Velikof 
asked the girl then. “Has it any 
unique claim to fame?” 

“Yes,” the girl said. “This is the 
place that the comets come back 
to.” 

“Ah, but the moths have eaten 
the comets,” Willy McGilly quoted 
from the old epic. 

T he girl brought them three big 
clay bowls heaped with fish 
eggs, and these they were to eat 
with three clay spoons. Willy 
McGilly and Dr. Velikof Vonk ad- 
dressed themselves to the rich 
meal with pleasure, but Arpad 
Arkabaranan refused. 

“Why, it’s all mixed with mud 
and sand and trash,” he objected. 

“Certainly, certainly, wonderful, 
wonderful,” Willy McGilly 
slushed out the happy words with a 
mouth full of delicious gloop. “I 
always thought that something 
went out of the world when they 
cleaned up the old shantytown 



BOOMER FLATS 



53 




dish of shad roe. In some places 
they cleaned it up — not every- 
where. I maintain that roe at its 
best must always have at least a 
slight tang of river sewage.” 

But Arpad broke his clay spoon 
in disgust. And he would not eat.. 
Arpad had traveled a million miles 
in search of it but he didn’t know it 
when he found it. He hadn’t any of 
it inside him, so he missed it. 

One of the domino players at a 
near table (the three eminents had 
notic^ this some time before but 
had not fully realized it) was a 
bear. The bear was dressed as a 
shabby man. He wore a big black 
hat on his head. He played 
dominoes well; hs.was winning. 

“How is it that the bear plays so 
well?” Velikof asked. 

“He doesn’t play at all well,” 
Willy McGilly protested. “I 
could beat him. I could beat any of 
them.” 

“He isn’t really a bear,” the girl 
said. “He is my cousin. Our‘ 
mothers, who were sisters, were 
clownish. His mother licked him 
into the shape of a bear for fun. But 
that is nothing to what my mother 
did to me. She licked me into 
pretty face and pretty figure for a 
joke; and now I am stuck with it. I 
think it is too much of a. joke. I’m 
not really like this, but 1 guess I 
may as well laugh at me just as 
everybody else does.” 

“What is your name?” Arpad. 
asked her without real interest. 

“Crayola Catfish.” 



But Arpad Arkabaranan didn’t 
hear or recognize the name, 
though it had been on a tape that 
Dr. Velikof Vonk had played for 
them, the same tape that had really 
brought them to Boomer Flats. 
Arpad had now closed his eyes and 
ears and heart to all of it. 

The hairy man and the Comet 
were still shooting pool, but pieces 
were stiH falling off the Comet. 

“He’s diminishing, he’s break- 
ing up,” Velikof observed. “He 
won’t last another hundred years 
at that rate.” 

Then the eminents left board and 
room and the Cimarron Hotel to 
go looking for ABSMs who were 
rumored to live in that area. 

ABSM is the code name for the 
Abominable Snowman; for the 
Hairy Woodman, for the Wild 
Man of Borneo, for the Sas- 
quatch, for the Booger-Man, for 
the Ape-Man, for the Bear-Man, 
for the Missing Link; for the nine- 
fbot-tall Giant things, for the liv- 
ing Neanderthals. It is believed 
by some that all of these beings 
are the same. It is believed by 
most that these things are no thing 
at all, nowhere, not in any form. 

And it seemed as if the most 
were right, for the three eminents 
could not find hide nor hair (rough 
hide and. copious hair were sup- 
(>osed to ^be marks by which the 
.ABSMs might be known) of the 
queer folks anywhere along the 
red bank of the Cimarron River. 
Such creatures as they did en- 



54 



IF 




counter were very like the shabby 
and untalkative creatures they 
had already encountered in 
Boomer Flats. They weren’t an 
ugly people. They were pleasantly 
mud-homely. They were civil and 
most often they were silent. They 
dressed something as people had 
dressed seventy-five years before 
that time — as the poor working 
people had dressed then. Maybe 
they were poor, maybe not. They 
didn’t seem to work very much. 
Sometimes a man or a woman 
seemed to be doing a little bit of 
work, very casually. 

It may be that the red-mud river 
was full of fish. Something was 
splashing and jumping there. Big 
turtles waddled out of the water, 
caked with mud even around their 
eyes. The shores and flats were 
treacherous, and sometimes an 
eminent would sink into the sand- 
mud up to the hips. But the broad- 
footed people of the area didn’t 
seem to sink in. 

There was plenty of greenery (or 
brownery, for it had been the 
dusty weeks) along the shores. 
There were muskrats, there were 
even beavers, there were skunks 
and possums and badgers. There 
were wolf dens and coyote dens dug 
into the banks, and they had their 
particular smells about them. 
There were dog dens. There were 
coon trees. There were even bear 
dens or caves. But no, that was not 
a bear smell either. What smell was 
it? 



“^What lives in these clay caves?” 
Velikof asked a woman who was 
digging river clams. 

“The Giants live in them,” she 
said. Well, they were tall enough to 
be giants’ caves. A nine-footer 
need hardly stoop to enter one of 
them. 

“We have missed it,” Arpad 
said. “There is nothing at all to be 
found here. I will travel farther, 
and I may find it in other places.” 

“Oh, 1 believe we are right in the 
middle of it,” Velikof gave the 
opinion. 

“It is all around us, Arpad, 
everything you wanted,” Willy 
McGilly insisted. 

But Arpad Arkabafanan would 
have none of the muddy water, 
none of the red sand or the red sand 
caves, nothing of anything here. 
The interest had all gone out of 
him. The three of them went back 
to the Cimarron Hotel without, 
apparently, finding a primitive 
creature or missing link at all. 

They entered the common room 
of the hotel again. Dominoes were 
set before them. They played list- 
lessly. 

“You are sure that there are no 
odd creatures around this place?” 
Arpad again asked the girl Crayola 
Catfish. 

“John Salt is an odd creature 
and he comes from this place,” 
Crayola told them. “The Licorice 
Man is an odd creature, I sup- 
pose. So is Ape Woodman. He 
used to be a big-time football 



BOOMER FLATS 



55 




player. All three of them had regu- 
lar-people blood in them. I sup- 
pose that's what made them odd. 
They were almost as odd as you 
three creatures. And the Comet 
playing pool there is in odd one. I 
don't know what kind of blood he 
has in him to make him odd." 

"How long has he been around 
here?" Velikof asked. 

"He returns every eighty-seven 
years. He stays here about three 
years, and he's already been here 
two of them. Then he goes off on 
another circuit. He goes out past 
the planets and among the stars." 

"Oh? And how does he travel out 
there?" /Velikof asked with cocked 
tongue and eye. 

"With horse and' buggy, of 
course." 

“Oh there, Comet," Willy 
McGilly called. "Is it true that you 
travel out among the stars with 
horse and buggy?" 

"Aye, that I do," the long gray- 
bearded man named Comet called 
back, "with a horse named Pee- 
gosh and a buggy named Harm a. 
It's a flop-eared horse and a 
broken buggy, but they take me 
there." 

"Touch clay," said Crayola Cat- 
fish, "for the lightning." 

T hey touched clay. Everything 
was of baked clay anyhow, even 
the doihinoes. And there had been 
lightning, fantastic lightning 
dashing itself through every crack 
and cranny of the flimsy hotel. It 



was a lightning brighter than all 
the catfish-oil lamps in the world 
put together. And it continued. 
There was clattering sequence 
thunder, and there was a roaring 
booming sound that came from a 
few miles west of the thunder. 

The Giants , came in and stood 
around the edges of the room. They 
were all very much alike, like 
brothers. They were tall and 
somber, shabby, black-bearded to 
the eyes, and with black hats on 
their heads. Unkempt. All were 
about nine feet tall. 

"Shall I sound like a simpleton 
if I ask if they are really giants?" 
Velikof questioned. 

"As your eyes tell you, they are 
the giants," Crayola said. "They 
stay here in the out-of-the-way 
places even more than the rest of 
us. Sometimes regular people see 
them and do not understand that 
they are regular people too. For 
that there is scandal. It was the 
scent of such a scandal, I believe, 
that brought the three of you here. 
But they are not apes or bears or 
monsters. They are people too." 

"They are of your own kin- 
dred?" Velikof asked. 

"Oh, yes. They are the uncles, 
the old bachelors. That's why they 
grow tall and silent. That's why 
they stand around the edges of the 
room. And that is why they dig 
themselves caves into the banks 
and bluffs instead of living in 
huts. The roofs of huts are too low 
for them." 



56 



IF 




“It 'would be possible to build 
taller huts,” Willy McGilly sug- 
gested. 

“It would be possible for you, 
yes,” Crayola said. “It would not 
be possible for them. They are set 
in their ways. They develop a 
stoop and a gait because they feel 
themselves so tall. They let their 
hair grow and overflow, all over 
their faces and around their eyes, 
and all over their bodies also. They 
are the steers of the species. Hav- 
ing no children or furniture, what 
can they do but grow tall and un- 
gainly like that? This happens 
also to the steers of cattle and bears 
and apes, that they grow tall and 
gangling. They become bashful, 
you see, so sometimes it is mis- 
takenly believed that they are 
fierce.” 

The roaring and booming from 
west of the thunder was becoming 
louder and nearer. The river was 
coming dangerously alive. All of 
the people in the room knew that it 
was now dark outside, and it was 
not yet time to be night. 

The Comet gave his pool cue to 
one of the bashful giants and came 
and sat with the eminents. 

“You are Magi?” he asked. 

“I am a magus, yes,” Willy 
McGilly said. “We are called emi- 
nent scientists nowadays. Veli- 
kof here also remains a magus, 
but Arpad has lost it all this day.” 

“You are not the same three I 
first believed,” the old Comet 
said. “Those three passed me sev- 

BOOMER FLATS 



eral of my cycles back. They had 
had word of an Event and they had 
come from a great distance as 
soon as they heard. But it took 
them near two thousand years to 
make the trip and they were wor- 
^ ried that myth had them as al- 
ready arriving long ago. They 
were worried that false Magi had 
anticipated them and set up a pre- 
venting myth. And I believe Jhat 
is what did happen.” 

“And your own myths, old fel- 
low, have they preened you, or 
have you really been here be- 
fore?” Willy McGilly asked. “I see 
that you have a twisty tongue that 
turns out some, really winding 
myths.” 

“Thank you, for that is my in- 
tent. Myths are not merely things 
that were made in times past. 
Myths are among the things that 
maintain the present in being. I 
wish most strongly that the present 
should be maintained. I often live 
in it.” 

“Tell us, old man, why is 
Boomer Flats a place that the 
comets come back to?” Willy said. 

“Oh, it’s just one of the post sta- 
tions where we change horses when 
we make our orbits. A lot of the 
comets come to the Flats-^Booger, 
Donati,' Encke, 1914c and Halley.” 

“But why . to Boomer Flats on 
the little Cimarron River?” Willy 
inquired. 

“Things are often more than 
they seem. The Cimarron isn’t 
really so little a river as you would 

57 




imagine. Actually it is the river 
named Ocean that runs around all 
the worlds.” 

“Old Comet, old man with the 
pieces falling off you,” Dr. Veli- 
kof Vonk asked out of that big 
head of his, “can you tell us just 
who are the under-people that we 
have tracked all around the world 
and haVe probably found here no 
mor^ than seventy miles from our 
own illustrious T-Town?” 

“A phyz like you have on you, 
and you have to ask!” the old 
Comet twinkled at Velikof (a man 
who twinkled like that had indeed 
been among the stars — he had their 
dust on him). “You’re one of them, 
you know.” 

“I’ve suspected that--fer a long 
time,” Velikof admitted. “But 
who are they? And who am I?” 

“Wise Willy here said it 
correctly to you last night. They 
are the scrubs who bottom the 
breed. But do not demean the 
scrubs. They are the foundation. 
They are human as all of us are hu- 
man. They are a race that under- 
lies the other several races of man. 
When the bones and blood of the 
more manifest races grow too 
thin, then they sustain you with 
the mixture of their strong kin- 
ship. The mixing always goes on, 
but in special eras it is more wide- 
spread. They are the link that is 
never really missing, the link be- 
tween the clay and the blood.” 

“Why are they, and I myself if 
I were not well-kempt and emi- 



nent, sometimes taken to be ani- 
mals?” Velikof asked. “Why do 
they always live in such outlandish 
places?” 

“They don’t always. Sometimes 
they live in very inlandish places. 
Even wise Willy understands that. 
But it is their function to stand 
apart and grow in strength. Look 
at the strong bone structure of the 
girl there! It is their function to in- 
vent form — look at the form her 
mother invented for her. They 
have a depth of mind, and they 
have it particularly in those 
ghostly areas where the other 
races lack it. And they share and 
mingle it in those sudden motley 
ages of great achievement and 
vigor. Consider the great ages of 
Athens, of Florence, of Los An- 
geles. And afterward, this people 
will withdraw again to gather new 
strength and bottom.” 

“And why are they centered here 
in a tumble-down hotel that is like 
a series of old daguerrotypes?” 
Willy McGilly asked. “Will you 
tell us that there is something 
cosmic about this little old hotel, as 
there is about this little old river?” 

“Aye, of course there is, Willy. 
This is the hotel named Xenodo- 
cheion. This is the special center of 
these Xenoi, these strangers, and 
of all strangers everywhere. It 
isn’t small. You merely see but a 
portion of it at one time. They 
center here to keep out of the way. 
Sometimes they live in areas and 
neighborhoods that regularized 



58 



IF 




humanity has abandoned 
(whether in inner city or boon- 
dock). Sometimes they live in eras 
and decades that regularized hu- 
manity has abandoned. For their 
profundity of mind in the more 
ghostly areas, they have come to 
have a cavalier way with time.. 
What is wrong with that? If regu- 
lar people are Finished with those 
days and times, why may not 
others use them?” 

The roaring and booming to the 
west of the thunder had become 
very loud and very near now, and in 
the immediate outdoors there was 
heavy rain. 

”It is the time,” the girl Crayola 
Catfish cried out in her powerful 
and intricate voice. ‘‘The flash 
flood is upon lis and it will smash 
everything. We will all go and lie 
down in the river.” 

All the Boomer Flats people 
began to follow her out: the Gi- 
ants, the eminents, everybody. 

‘‘Will you also lie down in the 
river. Comet?” Willy McGilly 
asked. ‘‘Somehow I don’t believe 
it of you.” 

“No, 1 will not. -That isn’t my 
way. I will take my horse and 
buggy and ascend above it.” , 

“Ah, but Comet, will it look like 
a horse and buggy to us?” 

“No, it will look quite other, if 
you do chance to see itt” 

“And what are you really. 
Comet?” Velikof asked as they 
left him. “What species do you be-' 
long to?” 



“To the human species, of 
course, Velikof. I belong to still 
another race of it, another race 
that mixes sometimes and then 
withdraws again to gather more 
strength and depth. Some individ- 
uals of us withdraw for quite long 
times. There are a number of races 
of us in the wide cousinship, you 
see, and it is a necessity that we be 
strangers to each other for a good 
part of the time.” 

“Are you a Saucerian?” 

“Oh Saucerian be damned, Veli- 
kofl' Herma means chariot or it 
means buggy; it does not mean 
saucer. We are the comets. And 
our own mingling with the com- 
monalty of people has -also had 
quite a bit to do with those sudden 
incandescent eras. Say, I’d like to 
talk with you fellows again some 
time. I’ll by. this way again in 
about eighty-seven years.” 

“Maybe so,” said Dr. Velikof 
Vonk. 

“Maybe so,” said Willy Mc- 
Gilly. 

T he eminents followed the 
Boomer Flats people to the 
river. And the Comet, we suppose, 
took his horse and .buggy and 
ascended out of it, Odd old fellow 
he was, pieces falling off him. 
He’d hardly last another hun- 
dred years. 

The red and Mack river was in 
surging flood wi(h a blood-col- 
ored crest bearing down., And the 
Flats — they were just too flat. The 



BOOMER FLATS 



59 




flood would be a mile wide here in 
one minute and everywhere in 
that width it would be deep enough 
and swift enough to drown a man. 
It was near dark, near the limit of 
roaring sound. But there was a 
pile of large rocks there in the 
deepening shallows. Plenty of 
rocks — at least one big heavy rock 
for every person. 

The Boomer Flats people under- 
stood what the rocks were for, and 
the Giants among them under- 
stood. Two of the eminents un- 
derstood. One of them, Arpad, 
apparently did not. Arpad was 
carrying on in great fear about the 
dangers of death by drowning. 

Quickly then, toxram mud into 
the eyes and ears and noses and 
mouths. There is^ plenty of mud and 
all of it is good. Spirits of Catfish 
protect us now! — it will be only 
for a few hours, for two or three 
days at the most. 

Arpad alone panicked. He broke 
and ran when Crayola Catfish 
tried to put mud in his mouth and 
nose to save him. He ran, and 
stumbled in the rising waters to his 
death. 

But all the others understood. 
They lay down in the red roaring 
river, and one of the giants set a 
heavy rock on the breast of every 
person of them to hold them 
down. The last of the giants then 
rolled the biggest of the rocks onto 
his own breast. 

So all were safe on the bottom of 
the surging torrent, safe in the old 



mud-clay cradle. Nobody can 
stand against a surging flood like 
that. The only way is to lie down on 
the bottom and wait it out. And it 
was a refreshing, a deepening, a 
renewing experience. There are 
persons, both inside and outside 
the orders, who make religious re- 
treats of three days every year for 
their renewal. This was very like 
such a retreat. 

When the flood had subsided 
(this was three days later), they all 
rose again, rolling the big rocks 
off their breasts. They cleared their 
eyes and ears and mouths of the 
preserving mud. They resumed 
their ways and days. 

For Velikof Vonk and for Willy 
McGilly it had been an enriching 
experience. They had found the 
link that was not really lost, leav- 
ing the other ninety-nine mean- 
while. They had grown in cousin- 
ship and wisdom. They said they 
would return to the Flats every 
year at mud-duck season and 
turtle-egg season. They went back 
to T-Town enlarged and happy. 

T here is, however, a gap in 
the Magi set, due to the foolish 
dying of Arpad Arkabaranan. It 
is not of Scripture that a set of 
Magi should consist of only three. 
There have been sets of seven and 
nine and eleven. It is almost of 
Scripture, though, that a set 
should not consist of less than 
three. In the Masulla Apocalypse 
it seems to be said that a set must 



60 



IF 




contain at the least a Comet, a 
Commoner and a Catfish. The 
meaning of this is pretty muddy, 
and it may be a mistranslation. 

There is Dr. Velikof Vonk with 
his huge head, with his heavy orbit- 
al ridges, with the protruding 
near-muzzle on him that makes 
the chin unnecessary and im- 
possible, with the great back-brain 
and the great good humor. He is 
(and you had already guessed it of 
him) an ABSM,.a neo-Neander- 
thal, an unmissing link, one of 
that branch of the human race that 
lives closest to clay and catfish. 

There is Willy McGilly who 
belongs (and he himself has come 
to the realization of this quite late- 
ly) to that race of mankind called 
the Comets. He is quite bright, and 
he has his periods. He himself is a 
short-orbit Comet, but for all that 
he has been among the stars. Pieces 
fall off him. He leaves a wake. But 
he'll last a while yet. 

One more is needed so that this 
set of Magi may be formed again. 
The other two aspects being al- 
ready covered, the third member 
could well be a regularized per- 
son. An older person of ability, an 
eminent. Or a younger person of 
ability, a pre-eminent. 

This person may be you. Put 
your hand to it if you have the 
surety about you, if you are not 
afraid of green snakes in the cup 
(they’ll fang the face off.you if 
you’re afraid of them), or of clay- 
mud, or of comet dust, or of the 
rollicking world between. •

ULTIIUA THULE 






Green food \^as free. Water 
was pure. But iron had a 
sickness caught from man! 



A VRAM DAVIDSON 



I N THE darkness of his grand* 
uncle’s medicine hut by the 
flickerflicker of the faint fire 
(whick the man was alllowed to 
have, grudgingly, and at high tax, 
for preparing his simple witcheries) 
the boy recollected the sound of 
the taptap beats on the tiny witch- 
ery-drum and the sight of the man- 
drakes lifting the lid of their bark 
box house and coming out to 
dance by the Hre, tossing up their 
small-small scrannel arms and' 
stamping their tiny-tiny feet to the 
toom-room, toom-toom, toom- 
toompetty-toom of the child-sized 
drum — then dancing backward 
and closing the lid on themselves 
as the last faint pulse beat died 
away. 

A small man, his uncle or 
granduncle (in those days the boy 
did not distinguish), with a skill in 
small witcheries and small magics 
by which he sustained them. And 



63 



the boy felt proud of seeing what 
other boys did not see. 

But most of his memories be- 
fore the breakaway were ill ones. 

When he grew big enough to 
wander from the partly under- 
ground medicine hut or the round 
thatched house where his uncle's 
sister sat mumbling as she 
pounded bark or stirred the acorn 
gruel, the boy learned swiftly 
enough of how little he had to 
pride himself in. If you are smaller 
by far than the smallest of any 
born in your birth year, if they are 
smooth of skin and fair of hair 
and you are dark and your 
swarthy skin is covered with a nap 
or bloom of dark hair — are these 
things to be proud of? If others 
have fathers and brothers. who re- 
turn from the hunt to be greeted 
by the singing of their women and 
if your only family connection 
with it all is when old uncle or old 
uncle's sister comes stooping up 
and waits for a bone or an offal 
to be tossed as to a dog — is there 
pride in this? 

To be sure, he was quicker of 
body and sharper of mind than any 
of his birth year; sharp and quick 
enough to learn that sharpness and 
quickness won praise only for oth- 
ers and in him were only to be re- 
sented. That magic qnd witchery 
produced fear and that fear oftfen 
produced respect; but that small- 
scale magic and witchery caused 
only small fear — suspicion, rather 
— and hardly ever respect at all. 
For fear and fears hung over the 
town like the smoke from the 
great central Tire on lowering days. 
Fear that someone was working a 
witchery, fear of the wild ones of 

64 



the woods, fear of the king and the 
tax-gathefs, fear of known magic 
and of unknown even more. And 
the boy who was small and sharp 
and dark and shaggy produced an 
effect of strangeness which was 
like the subtle smell of fear — but 
was not strong enough to ward off 
the hates and wraths which this 
caused — and besides — and be- 
sides . 

The affair of the great roan 
mammont, the rogue mammont, 
fear of fears and terror of terrors, 
brought all things to a head; but 
before that, long-long before that 
day of blood and death, that day 
of the hill-that-moved, the trees- 
that-walk, serpent-snout and 
spear-teeth and all the other names 
used when one dares not use the 
real name: mammont; long before 
then, when he was very small, there 
was the token. 

The token hung on a thong 
from a peg in a post in his grand- 
mother's hut. For a while it was 
above his head and he reached for 
it often while the old one squatted, 
mumbling, in the sun of the door- 
front. He couicf not remember the 
first time he actually reached it, 
standing on a stool (probably), 
but he had a clear recollection of 
one day scanning it and seeing it 
and recognizing it. It was carved 
of wood, roughly but forcefully, 
in the form of a bear. It had the 
bear's head and one tooth clearly 
in the crude snout; it had the 
bear's paws and legs. 

But the legs ended in the feet of 
a man, 

P erhaps at that time he had 
not recognized this strangeness; 

IF 




he had certainly never seen a bear, 
for it was not till later that Tall 
Roke brought in the cub which 
was partly petted and partly tor- 
tured until it was abruptly killed 
and eaten. Likely at that child- 
time he did not know that a bear 
has bear's feet and that although 
they resemble a man’s, yet they 
are not. Nor was it yet clear to 
him how subtly manlike, the carv- 
ing was. 

But he had the clear recollection 
of scanning it that one day and be- 
coming aware that the old woman, 
granduncle’s sister and his own 
grandmother, had come in and 
was staring at him, on her blear 
and withered face a look odd even 
for her on whom odd looks were 
common. A look of fear and love 
and awe and horror. 

Sensing that she was in what 
was for her a lucid mood, he asked 
as he pointed, “This — what?’’ 

And she, promptly and matter- 
of-factly, said, “Your father.’’ 
And as promply thrust awry her 
snaggle-snarl hair and screamed 
and rolled her rheumy eyes and 
tore open the bosom of her bark- 
cloth dress and beat and scratched 
her withered dugs and wailed and 
howled and beat her head upon the 
earthen floor. “Hinna!” she 
screamed. “Hinna! Hinna!’’ and, 
“Hinna-tenna!’’ 

Such fits and antics were not so 
rare as to alarm the boy — for all 
he knew, all grandmothers behaved 
so— just as, for all he knew, all 
fathers were carved of wood and 
hung on leather thongs from posts. 
But this fit was uncommon severe 
and he appreciated, in fact, he 
rather enjoyed the new aspects of 

ARNTENOF ULTIAAATHULE 



it, as he might have enjoyed a new 
grip noted in a dog-fight. 

Hinna. So the old man some- 
times addressed the old woman. 
Sometimes the old woman said it 
as she pointed out the small blue 
flowers of a plant occasionally 
brought back with other herbs and 
roots or leaves and barks from the 
woods by the old man. So: Hinna 
was the old woman and hinna was 
a flower, but he knew that this old 
woman was not thrown into a fit 
in order to ‘mention either; he did 
not know how he knew and won- 
dered, mildly, that he knew at all. 
Logic was here working scarcely 
above the level of intuition. 

The old woman shrieked and 
babbled of something which was 
“Woe!’’ but mostly her words 
were strange and, Hinna-tenna!**^ 
she screamed. And, "Arnt! Arnt 
Arnt!** 

And then the old uncle was 
kneeling beside her, soothing her, 
calming her, arranging her tattered 
dress of pounded bark-lining, car- 
rying her — at last, when her voice 
was a mere croon or drone — to 
the worn-almost-hairless half of 
deerhide which covered her grass 
bed. And the old man got up and 
seemed at a loss as he looked at 
the boy. Who sensed and instantly 
seized an opportunity. 

Pointing to the token on the 
thong, “My father,’’ he said. 

“Yes,’’ said the old man, un- 
surprised. Then he winced. 

What made the boy say what he 
next said, still pointing? No know- 
ing — unless it was unrealized 
awareness of a connection between 
strange things enclosed in a space 
of time — such as this moment 

65 




which had just passed, or perhaps 
still was passing. 

Pointing to the token he asid, 
“Arn’t. Arn’t.” 

“Arn,” his uncle said, absent- 
minded correction in his tone. 

So. Arn was the token which 
was the bear which was his father 
and his father had somehow, 
thrown the old woman into a fit 
in which Arnt was somehow dif- 
ferent. And what else was in the 
fit which was familiar yet differ- 
ent — fox something was. 

Ah. 

**Tenna/* the boy said; imme- 
diately correcting himself: 
na-tenna . " 

Without so much as a sigh and 
in the same flat, abstracted voice 
in which he would explain to a vis- 
itor at the medicine hut the care 
and feeding of mandrakes or the 
price of a charm or the manner of 
a charm (other men whose work 
was witchery had the better sense 
to sink their voices and roll their 
eyes and make at least a few fear- 
ful gestures and whisper at least a 
few words in a doleful whisper, 
lips to ear. Other witcherers com- 
manded higher prices, too, got 
amber-grains and goodly pelts, 
were not content with bones and 
offals) his granduncle said to him, 
“Hinna is the cornflower and is al- 
so my sister’s name. Your grand- 
mother. Was her daughter’s name. 
Your mother. Tenna is a word in 
the Old Tongue, now archaic, used 
chiefly for witchery. Spoken some- 
times by such relics as myself 
and sister. Tenna means ‘daugh- 
ter.’ Arn in the older tongue is 
‘bear.’ So, now I consider it, 
Arri'f may be applied to the tok- 

66 



en, for my sister’s daughter said 
she had it of the bear. As she said, 
too, she had you. But she was nev- 
er right in her wits after that and 
grew worse and we found her 
drowned.” 

After a moment he nodded once 
or twice and left the house without 
more word, confident, apparantly, 
that he had said everything there 
was to be said. As, perhaps, he 
had. 

T he boy realized, growing old-. 

er, that often he himself saw 
sequences and connections where 
other boys saw none. But just as 
he could see logic and they not, 
just so things that seemed sensible 
to them were senseless and unpre- 
dictable to him. More than once 
he had been stoned away from fol- 
lowing hunters, yet today he had 
been asked — not allowed, asked — 
‘‘Come, honey-dripper, bring us 
good luck!” And here he was with 
the rest of them in the high grass 
and the sun hot upon the earth and 
on them all so that he could smell 
it and them and the grass and oth- 
er things not even seen. 

Honey-dripper, with a guffaw. 
It was a* name for him. Comb-rob- 
ber was another. Both meant bear, 
who stole the honeycomb from the 
honey tree and ate it, dripping its 
richness, grubs and wax and all. 
But comb-robber, applied to him, 
was merely an ill-name. Honey- 
dripper was less so, was a laughing 
term, and— somehow— referred 
not exclusively to the bear but al- 
so had something -to do with men 
and the things men had with wom- 
en. Tall Roke it was who’d said 
him this name this day and asked 

IF 




him to come; and Tall Roke it 
was, when another had looked 
black and muttered, who had 
briskly and blithely answered, 
“What? For that some rough fel- 
low tumbled his mad mother and 
gamed her, saying, ‘I’m a bear!’ 
What? A bigger fool than she or 
you I’d be to think the kid an ill- 
bringer for that. Ah no, but that 
his old uncle’s witchery had maybe 
rubbed off on him a bit, and then 
a-smells as wild as any beasty and 
so may cover our own man- 
stinks — ’’ 

But as yet the boy could not 
smell the wild white horses they 
were hunting — the swift, mane- 
tossing, clever-cunning, clever- 
mad, mad-eyed, red-eyed, wild- 
eyed, wild, white horses — whom 
no man’s mind or hand had ever 
yet thought to tame. Three days 
since, some village stripling, gam- 
ing about in the meadows, had 
found a colt with its leg broken in 
a mole hole, had swiftly (but, be 
sure, not without a swifter, fear- 
ful lookabout) cut its throat and 
borne it home. Perhaps one of its 
marrowbones was still stewing in a 
pot of spelt; the rest had sure been 
eaten. But the clever-mad horses 
of the herd had tracked the lostling 
down to its place of injury, had 
seen the blood, had traced the 
drips of blood as far to the village 
as even their mad courage cared 
to go. Since then they had been 
waging war: trampling crops, at- 
tacking cultivators and wanderers 
with hooves and teeth. So now the 
menfolk were carrying the war un- 
to the horsefolk. 

Time was when only the poorest 
of the poor would have had stone 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



or bone for his weapons. All else 
had had iron — had even had arrow 
or spear-heads to spare, in case of 
breakage before a wandernain 
(some called them “shamblenain,” 
but not to their faces) would come 
trading new irons for old: amber 
and peltries their fee: taking the 
broken points with them back to 
strange and distant Nainland to 
mend upon their witchery-forge, 
an art which only the nains had.' 
As for bronze, that was only a 
memory, bronze had long since^ 
died of the green-sickness. As yet, 
out here, the deadly rust was mov- 
ing slowly, but move it did; some- 
thing w^s deadly wrong with iron, 
and ho nains came; grim was the 
mood of the distant king, and — 

“Hist, now,’’ said Tall Roke. 
“Mind the plan, now. Drive away 
the young stallions and the mares 
with stones, the colts will follow — 
cut off the great stallion, and 
whilst we three engage him from 
in front, you two cut his tendons 
from behind.” The great stallion, 
with hamstrings severed on his 
hind legs, would go down and nev- 
er rise. Deprived of leader, the oth- 
er steeds would flee. 

Tall Roke hawked and spat and 
grunted. He needed not to point. 
They had come to the edge of the 
escarpment and in the near dis- 
tance of the wide, shallow valley, 
they saw the horses like wee white 
clouds . floating in the blue-green 
sky of grass. For a moment they 
gazed, the five or six full men, the 
twice that many striplings and the 
boy who had no name. Then they 
spread out widely and began the 
slow and cautious descent from 
the rim. Slow, for there was no 

67 




swift going down that uncertain 
slope; cautious, because they dared 
not give alarm to the horse herd. 

The boy felt for the pouch with 
the stones in it. The touch was re- 
assuring. Nothing else was. His 
first hunt. His heart pounding. It 
had been agreed that any needed 
signaling would take the form of a 
ground squirrel's whistling, as this 
would (at most) arouse the hunger 
of no creature larger than a fox 
or hawk. Tentatively the boy 
formed his mouth to make such a 
signal. But he never made it. The 
while he had been keeping a sort 
of sketch of things in his head. 
Yonder was the sun. The cliff di- 
rectly behind. The wind, so. To 
the right must be the horse herd. 
A little left of straight ah^ad were, 
though now not seen, a clump of 
thick-boled trees. Beyond that, a 
low hillock of rusty scrub. A 
brook. A wallow. 

A larm, alarm rose so swift in 
his chest that it choked his 
breath. Something was wrong. Ev- 
erything was wrong. He had gone 
the wrong way — or — for he was 
much too close to the hillock, he 
could see it now, he could not see 
the trees, which meant — and then 
came the whistle, and the whistle 
was to have come from Tall Roke 
and Tall Roke should be that way 
and the whistle was over this way 
— Vertigo took him, he was on 
both knees and one hand. Earth- 
shake? For the hillock moved and 
his eyes fled from it and his eyes 
saw trees walking and someone 
screamed and screamed — it was 
not him, then it war him as it was 
many others, for by now all knew 

68 



it was the hill-that-moves, the 
trees-that-walk, all of them could 
see the serpent snout that rose up 
huge and hairy and drank the 
wind, all could see the flash of 
spear teeth, all could hear the hor- 
rid trumpet scream of the mam- 
mont! mammont! mamont! as its 
tree-huge legs shook the grassy 
ground in its terrible charge, its 
trunk sweeping down the grass be- 
fore it as a scythe, bloody scythe, 
bloody grass, bloody spears, 
bloody teeth — 

Fear and failing flesh and yet 
senses still undimmed enough to 
hear Tall Roke’s voice full strong 
as he shouted, “Hold to the plan! 
Axe men to the rear whilst I en- 
gage to the front — ” / and not we, 
he did not trust to any others’ 
courage to face the huge red 
mammont from the front, but still 
had hopes that some might brave 
the great beast’s hind legs to strike 
at the lower tendons. Onward the 
mammoth beast had come, fast, 
fast, but faster yet ran Tall Roke, 
passing it — so swift he might have 
escaped, had he run in another di- 
rection, had such been his intent 
— passing it, running backward be- 
fore it, turning it, darting back 
and away from it, shouting and 
feinting his spear at it — “Strike! 
Strike!’’ he shouted — 

But no one was there-to strike. 
No one was there but Tall Roke. 
One man. One boy. Who shrieked 
with all the fury of his unformed 
voice and cast his stones with all 
the power of his unformed arms. 
For one fell moment the mam- 
mont wavered, rage-reddened eyes 
darting from man to boy. 

“Ankles! Ankles! Ah! Strike! 

IF 




Ankles!’' hoarsely but still hope- 
fully: Tall Roke’s voice. But no 
one struck. And the one man’s 
spear hung in the air, it seemed not 
so much that he had cast it at the 
mammont as that the mammont 
had hurled itself upon the airborne 
spear: it lanced the line of the great 
face from tusk-socket to eye-sock- 
et: the mammont screamed its 
pain and rage: again the spear 
hung in the air: and now — and this 
was so puzzling — Tall Roke him- 
self hung in the air, his fair hair all 
in a mist about his face — the py- 
thon trunk seenried to pse slowly, 
slowly, slowly, and to descend 
slowly — slowly, slowly, and to 
wrap itself so slowly gently loving- 
ly about the man’s neck. 

T here were flowers in the 
meadow and bees in the air and 
then there was a dripping comb of 
honey and he thrust his paws first 
into the comb and then into his 
mouth and its taste was of gold 
and sweet and strong and delight- 
ful beyond the taste of any food 
tasted before and when it was 
quite quite gone he licked his paws 
and he licked the grass it had 
dripped on and then he went scam- 
pering off to where the bushes 
hung heavy with the full ripe ber- 
ries and he ate his wonder full of 
them and 

T hree of them returned alive 
to the village and Tall Roke 
was found alive (though only bare- 
ly) where the mammont had tossed 
and gored him but, unaccountably, 
not trampled him as it had the 
others. But he, too, was soon dead. 
Another’s head was found in the 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



branches of a tree. Something that 
was probably his body, for it could 
be nothing else, was smeared near- 
by. 

The horses had vanished. 

That the great roan mammont 
was a rogue, all agreed. Only a 
rogue would travel alone, and 
there was no sign at all of any oth- 
er mammont — and, for that mat- 
ter, of that one himself— any more. 

At first no one in the village said 
anything but. It has happened. 
Since the starting of the red-rust- 
sickness of all iron and the increas- 
ing wrath of the distant and once 
indifferent king, since the nains had 
ceased to visit and the tax exac- 
tions had begun to increase, ru- 
mors faint as whispers and whis- 
pers loud as shouts had been 
spreading, spreading, spreading. 
Some great calamity impended. 
And now it had come. It had hap- 
pened. 

Next in the village they began to 
ask. How did it happen? 

By this time the boy thought he 
knew. And there was one other 
who, he thought, also thought he 
kfiew. And that meant there was a 
third who certainly knew. 

The name of the second^ was 
Corm, a lad perhaps a year or two 
older, eyes gray rather than the 
common blue, hair not blond and 
curling but brown and lank, fallow 
of skin; his father was one of the 
three subchiefs of the townlet. If 
Corm had not given the boy mahy 
good words, that was nothing, no 
one did that; but he had never giv- 
en any ill ones at all. The third was 
a whey-faced, slack-mouthed, 
slack-limbed shambelton, with an 
almost perpetuat eruption about 

69 




the mouth at which he ever picked 
and which generally bled; a liar 
and bully and boor, yet well con- 
nected — that is, connected to fam- 
ilies of some small importance 
who, by talking loud and often and 
big, made that small seem greater. 

It was one of those moments 
which seem to have been a part of 
the center of all things, lying in 
wait from the beginning. No hint 
of it before. Old Minna’s grandson 
standing idly watching. Whey-face 
shambling along. The boy looking 
at him. Looking up to see Corm 
watching Whey-face as well. His 
eyes meeting Corm’s. Instantly, as 
though spoken words had passed 
between them: It was Whey-face 
who gave that first, wrong whistle, 
which would have been done right 
if Tall Roke had done it at the 
right time if it should have been 
done at all; it came from where 
Whey-face was, and only he would 
have been fool enough, coward 
enough to have done it, done it in 
coward^fool hopes of a reassuring 
return of it: it was that whistle, ill- 
done, which roused the mammont 
— in another moment Tall Roke 
would have seen it and managed to 
get us all safe away somehow, 
but — 

Still that same second. Whey- 
face looking up as though called, 
catching their glance, understand- 
ing, flushing, paling, and at once 
reacting in his coward way — not 
coward-foolish this time but cow- 
ard-cunning. Pointing at the boy, 
shouting at the boy, attracting in- 
stantly every eye and mind voicing 
the unvoiced and making clamor 
become instant fact: “It was him\ 
He brought the ill-fate, he brought 

70 



the mammont there! The bear’s 
bastard with the bear-stink on him! 
Bear’s bastard! Nain’s get! Made 
the mammont come! Curse-bring- 
er! Shag-skin! Killed our men and 
boys! Him! Him! HimV And, 
stooping, he snatched up a piece of 
dried filth, ran and flung it. 

Then sticks, then stones. Next 
would-be arrows, axes, spears. No 
need to inquire, discuss, reason, 
weigh — instant, heaxtjLwarrning 
hatred was quick, easy. ""Bear's 
bastard! Curse-bringer! Men 
killed! Bear-stink!" The mam- 
mont was gone, the boy remained. 
He saw Corm’s mouth open but 
neither he nor any heard Corm’s 
word, drowned out in the bull- 
voiced clamor of all of Whey-face’s 
kith and kin, believing or not be- 
lieving, belief beside the point, the 
point: Ours. Support him. Shout 
loud. Throw something. 

The boy ran. Terror runs swifter 
than rage follows. Boys can go 
where big men cannot — holes, hol- 
lows, runways, dogpaths, shinny 
up slender trees and drop over pal- 
ings_^There was hi^old uncle 
crouching by his slender fire. It 
was an instant. His grandmother’s 
hut. A packet thrust into his 
hands, the bark bag with the small 
victuals the old man took with 
him when he hunted herbs. A hide 
lifted up to show an opening the 
boy had never seen before. A bur- 
row, wide enough for him. A 
patch of light. The village 
palisades behind him. An echoing 
that might have been the clamor of 
the mob^. That might have been the 
beating of his blood; Something 
clutched in his other hand. He ran. 
He ran.

ARNTEN. Find your 
vFfather/’ the old uncle had 
said as he lifted the hide-flap. As it 
fell and all was dark, the boy heard 
him say, “It is time.” Then noth- 
ing but a faint moment of one of 
the old man’s chantings. Arnten, 
The word lodged like a grub in a 
honeycomb cell. Arnten. But there 
was no sign, yet. A faint thought: it 
is my name. No time for further 
thought. Arnten. His name. That 
and escape. For now, enough. A 
life. A name. 

In the woods, however, nothing 
was now asking his name. With a 
knowledge deeper than thought he 
avoided the hard-trodden dust of 
the common path and sank into 
the thicket like a snake. Behind, 
he heard the clamor and shouting 
descend into a single sound on a 
single note and stay there, like the 
noise of a swarm of bees hovering 
and mrumming its one dull note 
forever. Somehow it sounded im 
finitely more menacing than any 
cluster of mere words. Presently 
the humming-wrwmm/«g grew 
louder. Then loud. The ear- 
pressed earth echoed like a drum- 
head. The echo filled the ear and 
air. Suddenly it was gone and he, 
Arnten, realized that it had gone a 
time ago and that he was alone and 
that if any were still seeking him, 
they were not doing it here. 

Slowly he rose up in the thicket 
like a mist. He gained the path. He 
snuffed up the breeze. He listened. 
He was gone. 

A BIRD sang twit-twit-/w/7 on a 
branch. A ground squirrel 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



hopped and scampered, scam- 
pered and hopped, vanished from 
view. There was a smell of wet- 
ness, of damp earth and the scent 
of the sweet green breath of plants. 
Arnten knew that there were times 
to look up and times to look down 
and times to look straight ahead. 
He saw the bush, he saw through 
the bush and, a long, long way be- 
yond the bush he saw the boles of 
several trees but nothing in be- 
tween. Softly, gently, he pushed 
the shrubby branches aside. For a 
moment he paused, holding his 
breath, listening. There was not, 
had not been for long, sounds of 
mob or pack or crowd. There had 
been no man sounds at all, save for 
his own. It was improbable that 
any enemy of his own blood was 
near. It was not impossible. 

But he heard no new noise. Only 
the faint patter of the ground 
squirrel. Only the same twit-twit- 
twit of the bird on the branch. 

He slipped past the handful of 
branches and let them make their 
own return to their natural posi- 
tions, only restraining them 
enough so that they should close 
without sound. He went on a bit 
and then he stopped and consid- 
ered, there in the cool green cor- 
ridor which for now meant safety. 
It had been used enough to create a 
trail, but little enough to allow 
the bush’s growing to obscure the 
entrance. Perhaps small and 
dainty deer slipped along this tun- 
nel through the trees. They would 
not mind sharing it with him. Or 
perhaps white tiger, dire wolf, 
snowy leopard, used it in quest of 
the same small dainty deer. This 
thought contracted and shook his 

71 




limbs in a long shudder. He felt 
and saw the nap of hairs quiver up- 
on his skin and stand up from the 
fearful flesh. 

His mind leaped from thought to 
thought as a spark of fire leaps 
from one twig to another. An- 
other boy, conceiving the same 
thought, might find his mind work- 
ing thought of danger — beast 
equals danger — beast equals 
panic — run for your life, without 
even realizing the process. But his 
own mind worked thought of dan- 
ger — beast equals think about dan- 
ger — beast. And he stopped and 
thought. 

The thought is^iot the thing. 

And the thought told him that 
the thing, the great ones among the 
danger-beasts, were seldom if 
ever to be found in this'Tjart of 
Thule at this season of the year; 
they were to be found (or rather, 
avoided) farther to the north, 
where men had less thinned out the 
game on which they chiefly 
preyed; winter snows, in which the 
hooved beasts would flounder and 
be more easily tracked and 
trapped and killed, might indeed 
bring the great killers down. 

But then again might not. 

He felt the drum within his bos- 
om slow its clamor and then its 
beats receded to their normal slow 
strokes, below the threshhold of 
perception. He began to go on, 
but the trail was narrow and some- 
thing caught upon a branch and 
held him. He looked down and saw 
he was still carrying without 
awareness the two things hastily 
taken in his flight from town. The 
bark bag of food, the bear-token 
upon its leathern thong. It was this 

72 



last he now had to disengage. It 
seemed somehow as natural to 
hang it around his neck as to loop 
the grass cord of the food wallet 
from shoulder to hip. So. He had 
no weapon but he had food, itself 
a sort of weapon — was not hunger 
the chief enemy? He had a potency 
in the form of the bear carving, a 
token of whoever his father 
was — a father contained in a piece 
of wood on a thong was better 
than no father at all. Find your 
father, Arnten, What did he know 
of how or where? Either his father 
was or was not a bear. If not, then 
he knew and could know nothing. 
If so — then what? Where were 
bears? Anywhere, manywhere, 
where there were trees and streams. 
So. Avoid the grasslands, the 
great meadows. But he would have 
done so in any case. There was the 
game he could not take, there 
would be the great beasts, the dan- 
ger-beasts he could not forfend. 

Therefore, the forest. A tree 
creaked. It seemed a Yes. 

W HEN the balls of boiled mil- 
let and scraps of dried meat 
and fish were gone from his bark 
bag he went a while without and 
he hungered.. Then there were ber- 
ries and plants his old herb-uncle 
had shown him. He ate walking 
and he slept little. He seemed to 
need less of either. If the path 
forked and one branch inclined to- 
ward the plains of danger, he took 
the other. If there was still a choice 
and a question, he held the token 
in his hands and pointed it be- 
tween the paths. It moved. Some- 
times slowly, slightly. But it 
moved. It had one day not yet 

IF 




stopped moving when he felt the 
eyes upon him and looked up. 
They were great, glowing, amber 
eyes — intelligent eyes, but far too 
strange to be the eyes of any man. 
Nor were they. 

The figure was squat of body and 
shag of skin, with a brown main of 
hair upon scalp and broad face. 
The extraordinarily long arms 
were folded across the ex- 
traordinarily thick chest. A kilt of 
soft leather girdled the loins. 
Short were the powerful legs. Over 
arms, hands and chest and belly the 
long brown hair grew thickly. The 
boy found himself looking at his 
own body and limbs. Instantly, 
several thoughts — and one of 
them as an almost instant sur- 
prise: / am not afraid! And, an- 
other — 

“Nay, boy.“ The voice was 
strange in more than being un- 
known. It had odd tones and 
echoes, the final vowels nasalized 
so that almost they sounded as 
nay'n, boy'n. “Nay, boy. It’s isn’t 
me nurr any we who’s is fathered 
ye ’n given ’e them warm hairs up- 
on yurr’s skin.’’ So acutely did the 
strange one discern his thoughts. 
And spoke a few words of no un- 
derstanding, at first, to the 
boy — whose ear sped back and 
caught on a word he knew. 

He said, “The bear — ’’ 

Something flashed golden in the 
amber eyes. More strange words. 
Then — “Ye dow int speak en 
witchery words — hey’n?’’ Arnten 
shook his head. “Nay,’’ mur- 
mured the stranger. Almost, it 
was “Ngayng.’’ He said, “We 
speak it ever ’t’the forge. Ye must’s 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



ever speak en ’t’ Th’ Old Tongue 
t’iron, furr iron ’t’s a witchery 
thing. So we speak en it furr habit, 
ef we dow int think not to — ’’ 

“You said — *Arnt * — '' 

“Eh. We speak ’s’en it, too, 
’t’the bear, furr the bear dow be a 
witchery-beast. All creaturr dow 
die, but the bear dow come alive 
agains. And the Star Bear dow 
gived we-folk the first fire.” The 
glowing eyes fixed his own. The 
odd voice, strong and strange, but 
devoid of harm for him, went on. 
“En all of Thule’s the wurrd gone 
round, '‘When the wolf dow meet 
the bear: beware" ” There seemed 
something expectant in his tone, 
something expectant in his look. 

But look and tone alike meant 
nothing to the boy, who said, as 
though thinking aloud, “A nain.” 
The nain stopped his head and his 
shoulders. And the boy said, 
“Arnten, I am Arnten.” And this 
time the nain stooped his entire 
thick body to the waist. 

Then, straightening, he ex- 
tended an arm so long that its fin- 
gers almost touched Arnten’s 
chest. “We know en what place ’t’ 
is.” The boy’s eyes followed and 
saw the thick and hairy fingers of 
the thick and hairy hand were 
pointing not to his body but to the 
token slung upon it. 

“Where? It is here"" 

The nain grunted, held up a hand 
straight from the wrist in the nain 
sign of negation. “Not this. Th’ 
other this. Th’ — th’ — ” He strug- 
gled to express himself, his man- 
ner rather like that of a man seek- 
ing a paraphrase for a thing he 
does not care to name precisely. 
“Th’ other ThatV" 



73 




And he turned and walked away. 
Arnten followed. 

A fter a full seven-days’ walk 
they came to it. The place was 
more of a hole or cleft than a cave, 
but it was dry. Part of the ceiling 
had fallen in; boulders littered the 
floor. The nain without hesitat- 
ing or pausing put his chest 
against the largest and wound long 
arms around it. He moved the 
stone up and over and then back. 
“Take ’t’ up,” he said. “T’s not 
furr we to touch.” //, clearly, was 
not the rock. A moment passed, in 
the dim light before Arnten saw 
it. For a moment he thought it was 
a piece of wood. Then, more by in- 
tuition than lineal recognition, 
he knew, that what he saw on the 
ground where the rock'^had been 
was a witchery-bundle.* 

That. 

It was perhaps the size of his 
forearm and, with his forearm, 
after he had taken it outside in 
the sunlight, he wiped at the dusty 
hide covering. It was certainly a 
witchery-bundle. There were 
witchery signs upon it, some clear, 
some dim, some familiar, some 
unknown. Largest and most 
deeply etched were the ^un and the 
bear. The bear was almost cer- 
tainly a replica of the one he wore. 
Or — was it the other way around? 
“The sun,” he said. 

“Eh’ng,” the nain agreed. “The 
sun and the bear, they go togeth- 
er. For the sun dies and ’t comes 
alive again. And the bear dow die 
and dow come alive again. The 
sun give fire and the bear, too. 
Eh’ng,” he said, after a moment, 
eyeing the hide-covered bundle, 

74 



and musing. “How many snow- 
times? Two hands? Surely two. 
But three? Surely not three. Bear, 
he telled a-we. Here dow be my 
token. Here dow by my,” the nain 
gestured, ^"that. Bear telled: ‘Look 
for it. If you see him, manchild- 
bearchild — if you see my token 
on’-t’him; show him where.’ And 
we say’d him, Eh’ng-ah, Bear.” 

It was mystery, but it was good 
mystery. Witchery, but he could 
not think it any but good witchery. 
It was a good moment. Why, then, 
did the flood of bad memory rise 
up in his ipind, come spilling out 
of his mouth? “They stoned me. 
They pelted me with filth. They 
called me naMs get and bear's bas- 
tard and they tried to kill me.” 

The nain’s amber-colored eyes 
glowed and darkened and in level 
sunlight glowed like a beast’s in 
the night, glowed red, glowed 
like an amber in the nighttime fire. 

Words like distant thunder 
rolled in his vast chest and rum- 
bled in his wide throat. 

“Wolf’s lice! Accursed smooth- 
skins!” He spoke at last in the 
common tongue and continued to 
do so, though occasionally drop- 
ping into naintalk or the archaic 
language of witchery. “If it were 
not for us and our iron they would 
still be eating of grubs and lizards 
and roots. And what will they do 
now, as iron dies? Is there one of 
them, a single one even, with cun- 
ning and courage enough to feed 
the wizards? Their king, ah, he 
might have, when he was young, 
but he’s gotten old now, he’s got- 
ten half-mad now, he looks in the 
wrong direction, he afflicts where 
no affliction can help, the wind 

IF 




blows cruel hard from the north 
but he thinks it blows from the 
south! A nain’s life is that it's 
worth to try to persuade him — if a 
nain wished it. As for the rest of the 
slim race — " He caught his breath, 
part in a sigh, part in a sob. The 
fiery glow in his eyes began to die 
away. 

“Nay, I'll say no more as re- 
gards that race and blood, 'tis part- 
ly yours. They may deny it, may 
deny you — you may wish to deny 
it and them. But the blood cannot 
be denied. Nay, nay. The blood 
cannot be denied.” Abruptly, ges- 
turing to the bundle, the nain 
said, “Open it then.” 

The outer covering had been tied 
tight with sinews, but his probing 
fingers found one loose enough to 
allow his teeth purchase. He 
gnawed, felt the fibers give 
way — give until his teeth met with 
a click. Quickly his fingernails 
pulled the thread, Jtugged it from 
pierced hole, frorn the next and 
next. Some sort of dried mem- 
brane — the bladder, perhaps, of a 
large animal — was inside the 
outer covering, bound about with 
bark cord which did not long resist 
attack. Inside was a long pouch 
with a drawstring -tied in tassels. 
Carefully he unfastened this, 
carefully he laid out the contents 
on the outer wrappings. 

First, by size alone, was a knife 
in a sheath of horn and leather, 
with a good bone handle carved in 
the same likeness of a bear. It was 
entirely unaffected by the iron- 
rot. It was a good knife. 

There was also a dried and 
withered beechnut. 

There was also a greenstone. 

ARNTENOF ULTIAAATHULE 



There was also a bear’s claw. 
There was also, bent and dou- 
bled, but not yet broken, a river- 
reed. 

There was nothing else. 

He looked up to ask about these, 
but the nain was gone: 

E very man had a witchery- 
bundle; even children devised 
them in imitation of their elders. 
Spme had richly adorned ones, the 
contents bought of high-priced 
witcherers for nuggets of atnber 
and pelts of marten, sable, ermine, 
white tigers, snow leopards. Some 
had but meager pouches con- 
taining perhaps a single item — a 
bone, a dried this-or-that, a some- 
thing seen in a dream and sought 
for and found. A tooth pried from 
a dry skull. A fragment of some- 
thing said to be a thunderstone. 
Some had inherited. 

So had he. 

The knife alone would at any 
time have been deemed a good in- 
heritage, the more so now that 
good iron was hard to find and 
harder to keep. The more so for 
the circumstances of its hiding 
and finding. But what did the 
other mean? A bear claw, now 
that- was easy to understand. But 
the reed? The greenstone? Arnten, 
find your father. Had he found 
him? Not yet.' But now, having 
found this much, might he not find 
a source? For as long — no, long- 
er — than he himself had lived, the 
nains had not seen his father. He 
might be dead. He might be far 
away. He might be neither. He 
might be alive and very near. 

Arnten carefully restored the 
magic items to their pouch — ex- 

75 




cept for the knife, which he slung 
al^ut his waist — and started off. 
Excitement and happiness had 
made him heedless and when he 
heard the low-voiced song in the 
clearing he had no thought but to 
see who was singing it. 

It was one of the Painted Men, 
that was at once obvious — one of 
the Painted Men whom it was 
death to see unpainted. By great- 
est good fortune, though, he had 
just finished painting himself, 
however — and what a curious pat- 
tern his skin did present! Almost 
hideous. Not till the man, still 
hulnming his witchery-song, lifted 
his brush and dipped it in a tiny pot 
did Arnten realize, cold with* hor- 
ror, that what he was seeing was 
the man’s naked skin! — that he had 
only then begun. 

The Painted (or unPainted) Man 
swung about, panting with shame 
and rage. Arnten felt the club’s 
first blow. 

Ill 

T he old nain stood stolidly 
where the uneasy soldiers had 
bade him stand. He could without 
great effort have broken the ribs of 
all of them and the necks of most 
before any of them could stop him 
—and perhaps it was this that 
made them uneasy. But perhaps 
not. The king’s camp and court 
was an uneasy place in general 
these days — not that the rest of 
Thule lay at much ease either. 
Slots of sunlight came through the 
smoke hole in the top of the great 
tent. The king sat back on a pelt- 
piled bench and the nain thought it 
seemed they lied who said the king 

76 



was age- wasted. Indeed, as the Or- 
fas sat there, glaring, hands'clench- 
ed upon his knees, he seemed all 
too vigorous. Within himself the 
old nain sighed a slight sigh. Only 
to the extent that the smoothskins 
were unpredictable were they pre- 
dictable at all. Ah, eh. Seasons 
come and seasons go and ever the 
race of nains would remain upon 
the earth. Meanwhile, one endured. 
Heat, cold, toil, hunger, thirst, a 
savage beast, an unwise king. 

A witchery queen. 

The soldiers, fumbling and 
breathing their unhappiness, finish- 
ed shackling the old nain’s horse- 
hide fetters to one of the roof 
posts, were angrily waved outside, 
almost stumbled over, each other 
in their eagerness to obey. 

For a long moment the king 
continued to glare. Then he said, 
slowly and with effort, but quite 
correctly, “Uur-tenokh-tenokh- 
guur.” 

So, this was something. At least 
the king remembered the nain’s 
proper name. Or had learned it. A 
small courtesy, perhaps. But a 
courtesy. He would return it. “Or- 
fas,” he said. 

The king’s head snapped up with 
a jerk. He was not angered, he was 
not pleased, his attention had been 
called to something forgotten. 
Probably it had been long since he 
had been called by his own name in 
The Old Tongue, called anything 
(perhaps) save King or Great Bull 
Mammont or some other lickleg 
flattery such as the smoothskins 
used. The old nain almost without 
thinking essayed more syllables in 
the witchery language, but the 
king’s swift gesture cut him off. 



IF 




“My store of that speech has 
rusted in my mind,” Orfas said, 
“as has my story of the iron you 
have cursed.” His head shifted, his 
eyes flashed. "‘"'Why have you 
cursed it?” 

“We have not. Do you curse 
your kingdom?” 

“You are the High Smith of the 
nains. I have not had you brought 
here to bandy questions with me.” 
“You had not brought rne here 
at all, had 1 not thought you would 
keep your word.” 

Bluff and bluster. What? Not 
kept his word? How? 

“You said I would not be 
bound.” 

A false and further look of out- 
raged pride, falling into one of 
faint regret and helplessness at 
having been stupidly misunder- 
stood. “I said that you would not 
be bound with iron.” 

“Is it by such cunning shift of 
words that you hope to command 
either my respect or my assis- 
tance?” The king flushed, either in 
affront or from some vestigial 
sense of shame. “Do you think me 
an owl or a bat, unable to see in 
daylight? I see that none of your 
captives are bound in iron. It is not 
out of any honor that I have been 
bound in thongs of skin, but be- 
cause you no longer trust iron.” It 
was a statement, not a question, it 
went home. The king looked aside, 
for a moment at a loss. “I will give 
you an advice — ” The king sat up. 
“Sea-cow’s skin is tougher by far 
and far less risky to hunt.” 

The king growled and moved on 
his bench. Then he came forward 
and, stooping, loosed the High 
Smith’s bounds. “It is well,” the 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



old nain said aloud. In his mind he 
said that in the brighter light the 
Orfas looked his full age indeed. 
Gray streaked the once yellow hair, 
now scanted. The smoothskin was 
no longer quite so smooth of skin 
at all: here wrinkled, there slack, 
elsewhere puffed with fat where not 
hollowed. It was nonetheless well, 
this act. Uur-tenokh-tenokh-guur 
sat and the king sat before him. 
Would he eat? — Would he drink? 
the king asked. The nain grunted, 
held his hand up. No. A silence fell. 

“Listen,” said the king at last. 
“What will you nains do when the 
barbar-folk invade?” 

“I do not know that they will in- 
vade. I do not believe that they will 
invade. Why do you think so?” 

The king restrained himself. Be- 
neath his shag eyebrows his eyes 
looked at the nain like the waters 
of a wintry sea. “Why should they 
not invade? Are we now known to 
them as the source of great wealth? 
Amber and ivory and peltry — do 
they not value these things? Is 
there not a proverb. When the prey 
stumbleSy the hunter sharpens his 
knifel They will invade to gain our 
wealth; they will invade because 
without iron, good iron for weap- 
ons, we are weak before them; they 
will invade because I tell you they 
intend to invade and it is in order 
to strengthen themselves by weak- 
ening us that they have cursed our 
iron — ” 

The old nain wheezed in the way 
that nains have and he said, “So 
now it is the barbar-folk who have 
cursed iron. And not the nains.” 

Slant-glanced, Orfas looked at 
him. “All the witchery of iron is 
yours and you have kept it yours 

77 




and we have suffered you to keep 
it yours. Besides the one kept by 
treaty at my court, there has been 
no forge outside of Nainland. If 
any man had a broken spear or 
plowpoint, he had to wait in hopes 
of a wandernain coming by with 
unbroken spear or plowpoint to 
trade him old for new plus a good- 
ly gift — Nay, High Smith. I never 
^grudged the nainfee, myself pay- 
ing highest of all. If this is at the 
bottom of all, let it be said the 
nainfee will be raised, let it be 
, doubled, tripled — ” ' 

“it is not we.” 

The king’s teeth clenched upon a 
strand of beard he had thrust into 
his mouth. “What has ever hap- 
pened to iron without the nains’ 
causing it to happen?” 

“This is a new thing, King. Had 
we not asked you long before you 
asked we?” 

The king’s hand made a move- 
ment, the king’s face made a move- 
ment. The king was not in an in- 
stant persuaded. “You asked in 
order to cover yourself. But you 
have not covered yourself. Do you 
not know that the kings ears are 
the longest ears in Thule"] I hear 
all things and 1 can, from what I 
hear, feckon all things. Thus it is 
that I know that iron is accursed, 
that the nainfolk have cursed it — 
at whose behest and for what pur- 
pose? Your silence is useless. 
Speak, then.” 

The old nain sighed. 

“If you hear all things, then al- 
ready you have heard of what the 
nains say among the nains in Nain- 
land, namely that it is doubtless a 
device of the neglected wizards of 
Wizardland in order to ensure that 

78 



they do not remain neglected: this 
curse, the death of iron. And if 
from what you hear you can reck- 
on all things, then you can reckon 
what needs be done.” 

Now it was the king who sighed. 

“You speak to me as though we 
were two old women pounding 
bark. You will speak differently if 
I come upon Nainland with all my 
men.” 

The old High Smith shook his 
massive head. “It is all one, if you 
come upon Nainland with all your 
men or with but one or none of 
your men. The forges of Nainland 
are cold, Orfas. The forges of 
Nainland are cold.” 

A S HE stepped from the outer 
to the inner of the two rooms 
in which he was to be lodged— or 
confined — he saw three great white 
flowers lying together upon a mat. 
He stopped still. 

“1 thought you might remem- 
ber,” a voice said. “I thought it 
might please you.” 

“Dame, I do remember,” the 
old nain said. “And I am pleased.” 
He touched without bending 
down the flowers with his fingers. 
The blooms were scentless, but the 
room contained the scent of some 
that had never blossomed in the 
northern land of Thule. He had 
heard of the tiny horns and small 
flasks carven in strange designs 
upon strange stone, which contain- 
ed the odorous essences of plants 
for which Thule had no name, de- 
livered at intervals in trading ves-

anointing and the pleasure of the 
Orfas Queen. He turned.

that they pleased you; so I gave

— ” She took from her broad be- 
jewled belt the ivory case contain- 
ing the three small things so care- 
fully wrought: dirk and spoon and 
comb. “Only see,” she said, sor- 
rowfully. The red-rotted' metal 
crumbled at her slight finger 
touch. “Can you not effect a 
cure?” 

His broad stern face relaxed in- 
to something much like sorrow, he 
held both his hands straight up at 
the wrists. “They are so .small,” 
he said, musing. “All the witchery 
of iron known to the nains might 
just suffice to mend them. But the 
Orfas King would not believe that. 
If these could be cured, he would 
expect, he would demand, he would 
require, that aH the rotting iron in 
his realm be cured. And this can- 
not be done. I do not say it can 
never be done. But it cannot be 
done now. I do not know when. 
Perhaps never again in our lives — 
Dame — perhaps never in our lives 

A moment’s silence. “I shall 
leave them at the forge,” she said. 
Again a moment’s silence. Then 
she said and her beauty seemed no 
less than it had been that long ago 
when Uur-tenokh-tenokh-guur had 
been a wandernain and she the lady 
of the Orfas Chief. He not yet 
king. She not yet queen. Sundry 
sayings floated in his mind. One 
queen is every queen, every queen 
is all queens. A beautiful woman, 
no doubt, and without question 
well versed in witchery, though he 
knew as little of queencraft as she

of naincraft. She spoke again and 
said, “What have you to tell me of 
one who waits to return from 
across the all-circling sea?” He 
looked at her with pure unknow- 
ing and the certainty ebbed from 
her face. Then she said, “One who 
is not to be named, one who is the 
son of the half-brother — ” 

Understanding seemed to come 
not so much from his mind as 
from his broad and grizzled chest, 
whence a sigh of comprehension 
welled.‘ “Ahhh. That one, who con- 
tested with — Nay, Dame, I haven’t 
seen that one for four handfuls of 
seasons. Eh, must be full four. Nor 
heard of that one in that time. Say 
you that he has passed the all-cir- 
cling seas?” 

She gazed at him, a line between 
her brows. “Say you not? I see 
ou seem full ignorant of what I 
ad thought every nain, as every 
man, has heard: that one fled to 
the barbar-lands after fleeing court 
— when my Orfas gained the king- 
ship — and has conspired to curse 
the iron so that, when he returns 
with hordes of barbar-folk, the 
kingsmen shall be as though un- 
armed. And say you that you know 
this not?” 

He stretched forth both his long, 
long arms and held up both his 
thick and calloused palms — 
straight up — and he looked at her 
with pure unknowing. 

L ong he sat there alone, mus- 
ing on what she had said, striv- 
ing to make sense of it. Long he 
sat there, reflecting on old con- 
flicts long forgotten — though 
clearly not forgotten by the Orfas 
King. Long he sat there, yearning 

79 




for the red fires and the hot forges 
and the lust, and joy of beating out 
the good red iron. Old forge songs 
and sayings came to him and old 
sayings not of the forge at all, such 
as By three things only can a king 
be made: by strength, by magic, 
and by fortune. 

Having set in the outercourt a 
watch of mandrakes who would 
shriek beshrew if so much as un- 
bidden shadow fell, Merreddelfen, 
the principal witcherer, and the 
king and queen sat in the Room of 
Secret Counsel. 

Said the/queen, “What news?” 
Said the king, “What help?” 

Said the sage, “Much news, lit- 
tle help.” 

In his mind he said. Little news, 
no help. But one did not say such 
dire words, doom words, to the 
king. “Slayer of SpearTeeth, the 
Painted Men report a spy in the 
forest. I have no fear; the spy is 
dead.” 

Said the king, “Why dead? Why 
dead? From a dead spy no news 
can be gotten.” 

Said the queen, “Why not dead? 
A dead spy betrays no secrets.” 
Said the sage, “Great Dire 
Wolf, a dream has been dreamed 
of All-Caller, the great fey horn. 
No doubt this portends great good 
and who better to enjoy great good 
than thee. Great Dire Wolf?” 

Said the king, “Ah.” 

Said the queen, “Oh.” 

Said the sage, “Woe.” 

Said the king and queen, 

^^Whatr 

Said the sage quite swiftly, 
“Woe to the enemies of the King 
of Thule, the Slayer of Bull Mam- 
monts, the Great Dire Wolf.” 



Said the sage quite slowly, 
“Wearing my Cloak of Night, I 
crept to the mines; there I heard 
the nain-thralls chanting in the Old 
Language, singing in the Magic 
Tongue. Lord and Lady, they in- 
toned a tale of Fireborn, a thing of 
witchery of which they said it will 
cut good iron. Good iron! — Lord 
and Lady! And if the nainfolk 
make words about good iron, is 
this not a sigh that the nains know 
that iron will soon be as good as 
iron was before?” 

Said the sage quite steadily, 
“Lady, you must use all your ways 
and wiles. Lady, you must pre- 
pare for many journeyings. Lady, 
you must wear many masks.” 

Then they set their heads even 
Closer together and they whispered 
and nodded and bit their lips. The 
mandrakes muttered. And the 
shadows danced. 

T he breadth of the cavern was 
one nain wide and the height 
of the cavern was one nain high. 
Soldier guards, kingsmen, were 
obliged to stoop. More than once 
when the nain-thralls had been or- 
dered to make the roof higher 
they expressed a gruff unwilling- 
ness to do so, saying that the roof 
would fall. So the guards were ob- 
liged to swing sideways the cudgels 
with which they struck the nain- 
thralls if the nains did not hack 
their stone-mattocks into the 
crumbly ironrock swiftly enough 
or if they lingered or stumbled 
while carrying the baskets of ore 
up the long incline and up the risky 
ladders set in shallow steps — up, 
up and up to the open sky inside 
the grim stockade.

IF 




Not long ago the notion of 
nain-thralls had only belonged to 
the past — a subject for winter 
tales or summer-night songs — 
how, in the days of bronze — when 
no king reigned — the nain-thralls 
dug the brazen-ore* and forged 
the brazen-tools, how the green- 
sickness came upon Thule and all 
bronze died and Chaos was king; 
how the nains discovered the se- 
cret witchery of iron and were 
free men at all times after, only 
paying the nainfee to the man 
king who in subduing the chiefs 
succeeded them as Power. 

Thralldom was still the subject 
of song and story — ^.or rather, 
again. 

But who cared what dirges the 
nains sang as they toiled or what 
accounts they told as they lay on 
their beds of bracken in their im- 
prisoned nights? 

The swans fly overhead 
A nd the nains see them. 

The moles tunnel through the 
earth 

And the nains see them. 

Stockades do not wall the swans 
A nd the nains see them. 

Fetters do not bind the moles 
A nd the nains see them. 

The baskets of ore were emptied 
into hand barrows and the thralls 
carried the barrows to the forge. 

Once the nains were free as swans 
A nd the nains see them. 

Once the nains were free as moles 
A nd the nains see them. 

* Although the presence of bronze as a 
crude earth is very rare, it is not unknown.

The forge was a flat rock ris- 
ing from deep under the ground. 
The fire burned upon a hearth of 
other flat rocks, raised to a plat- 
form of the same height as the 
forge. The lumps of ironstone 
(and the articles of sick iron) were 
placed in the fire and burned. Al- 
though the kingsmen walked to 
and fro in violation of the ancient 
compact which excluded them as 
it did all strangers, they learned 
nothing from their observations 
that did them any good. All ores 
looked alike to them; they did, 
not know which ones to discard. 
All fired ironstones remained 
mysteries still to them; they knew 
not, though the nains did, which 
ones to discard as too brittle and 
which to pull out with greenwood 
toolsticks to be pounded upon the 
forge . stone. Nor did they learn (or 
very much attempt to learn). the 
art of smiting with the stout stone 
hammer, turning and beating, 
beating and turning — all the while 
intoning in the Old Tongue: 

Pound it, pound it, pound it well. 
Pound it well, well, well. 
Pound it well, pound it well. 
Pound it well, well, well . 

because it was said. The sound of 
the voice is good for the iron . 

P erhaps it was no longer 
as good as it once had been. 
Nothing seemed to be. Day after 
day the nains toiled to make new 
iron, hacks and spears and knife- 
heads and arrow points. And day 
after day the productions of — at 
first — the previous year were re- 
turned to them, rotten with rust, 

81 




flaking and powdering, to be 
melted down and made new and 
whole again. The previous year — 
at first. Then the irons of the pre- 
vious half-year. Then the previous 
season. Then last week, month — 
last fortnight. 

One sweating nainsmith paused 
and pointed to a red-sick lance- 
head and his chest, thick and 
thicketed as some woodland hill, 
swelled as he spoke. “Not a 
seven-night since I beat this out — 
and now look how swift the iron- 
ill has afflicted it!” And he added 
in the witchery-tongue: “Thou art 
sick, thou art sick. Alas and woe 
to thee and us for thy very sick- 
ness” 

And in his rumbling, echoing 
voice he began to chant and was 
joined by his thrall-fellows: 

Woe for the iron that is sick, 
And the nainsseeit. 

Woe for the black stone whose 
red blood wastes, 

A nd the nains see it. 

He thrust the heap of rusted 
metal into the wood fire, deep, 
deep, till red coals and red metals 
met. 

Woe for the king whose men take 
captive, 

A nd the nains see it. 

They take captive upon the paths, 
A nd the nains see it. 

They lead away in heavy ropes, 

A nd the nains see it. 

Captivity and toil lay waste the 
heart, 

A nd the nains see it. 

Captivity and toil lay waste the 
flesh. 



And the nains see it. 

The nain-thralls waste like iron. 
The kings evil is like rust. 

The queens lust is wasteful, evil. 
Evil, evil, are these times. 
These days, consumed as though 
by wolves. 

When will the wolf confront the 
bear, 

A nd the nains see it? 

When wilt the stars throw down 
their spears? 

A nd the nains see it? 
Confusion take these smooth of 
skin 

A nd the nains see it? 

When will the wizards* mouths 
be fed, 

A nd the nains see it? 

The nainsmith seized a lump 
of iron and beat upon it with the 
stone hammer with great, re- 
sounding blows; and with each 
blow they all shouted a word: 

When! Will! This! King-! -dom! 
Rot! And! Rust! 

A nd! The! Nains! See! It!

S TRANGE sounds he heard as 
he lay between earth and sky, 
rising and sinking, turning over 
and over again. Strange calls upon 
strange horns, strange voices, 
sounds. Pains, swift and passing 
like flashes of lightning, shot 
through him, again and again, 
then less often. The Painted Men 
were pursuing him; he hid from 
them; he hid in hollows beneath 
the roots of trees, he hid in the 
forks of the branches of trees, 
perched upon the crests of rocks, 

IF 



82 




slid into the spaces between them. 
Always, always, saw the Painted 
Men prance by, panting in rage 
and shame that he had seen their 
naked skin. Always, always he 
stayed quite still. And always, al- 
ways, they passed him by. And al- 
ways, always they paused, legs fro- 
zen in mid-stride. 

And always they turned, saw 
him; he felt the blows; all van- 
ished. 

Years went by. 



W HEN he became aware that 
he was returning to the ev- 
eryday world he said in his mind 
that he would be very cunning and 
not reveal that he was no longer 
in the other world. He lay very 
still. Perhaps the Painted Men 
were uncertain if he were alive or 
dead and were lying in wait to 
see. He could not, through his 
parted eyelids, observe anyone or 
anything at all, save for the green 
network surrounding him and 
through which faint glints of sky 
were visible. But he had a faint 
yet firm feeling that if he were to 
roll his eyes just a bit to the right 
He did not; he was too canny 
for that. 

Besides, his right eye seemed 
swollen so much that — 

And then a hand appeared, 
small as that of a large child, deli- 
cate as that of a young woman, 
yet not either: in the dim green 
light and through only one and a 
half eyes the hand seemed not 
entirely real, seemed almost trans- 
lucent, had something about the 
bone structure, the nails — how 
many joints were there — nacreous 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



as the inside of certain sea or river 
shells. 

The hand placed something on 
his puffed eye, something cool and 
damp and soothing. 

... and without awareness of in- 
tent to do so, he put up his hand 
and took the other by the wrist and 
sat up. Almost, he had not held 
the hand at all. Almost, it was as 
if his fingers were encircling 
something which had dimension 
without having substance — a deli- 
cate flower, as it might be, in the 
shape of a hand — and it slipped 
out from his grasp as simply as a 
sunbeam. 

He had never seen a perry be- 
fore. 

Something slipped off his eye — 
he saw it was a dressing of bruised 
leaves and grasses, damp as 
though with the morning's dew: 
the perry’s delicate and almost in- 
substantial hand took it and 
placed it on the swollen eye again 
and the perry’s other hand took 
his hand, did not so much lift as 
guide it to hold the compress in 
place. 

As the thin dew sparkling upon a 
cobweb, so did the perry’s gar- 
ments glint and sparkle; as the shy 
fawn stands in the gladey under- 
brush, not quite trembling and 
not quite looking at the intruder 
but poised for instant flight, so 
did the perry stand at the entrance 
to the leafy bower. 

Arnten’s body did not so much 
still pain him as it echoed faint 
reflections of remembered pain. 
Dim outlines- of bruises he could 
see here and there upon his skin; 
he remembered enough lore of 
herbs and simples from his medi-

cine uncle to know that even the 
most puissant leaves or roots or 
grasses had not by themselves 
done all this work of healing: but 
the witchery of the perries, either 
intent or inherent or both, had 
aided them. At first he had had a 
fleeting thought that he might be 
in the hands of The Woman of the 
Woods, of whom many tales were 
told. To be sure, he had never seen 
the Woman of the Woods, just as 
he had never seen a perry — but 
his uncle had told him enough of 
each so that now he knew. His 
uncle who was his mother’s uncle. 
His mother whom he had lost. 

A rnten.find your father. 

His father whom he had never 
had. The bear he could not find. 
The man, the mocker (had said 
Long Roke) who had” ‘‘gamed” 
his mother. The bogey for whom 
the boys of the village had held 
him slightly in awe and so much in 
scorn. Because of whom he had 
fled for very life. In which flight 
he had all but lately lost his Jife. 
And now lay here, back from the 
edge of death, in the company of 
a creature far more fey than any 
nain, who spoke no word and 
barely Ipoked at him and barely 
smiled yet had felt that deep con- 
cern for him and even now trem- 
bled between visibility and invis- 
ibility, substance and shadow, 
staying and leaving. 

This gentle presence touched 
the cords which bound his pent 
misery and long-contained sor- 
row and did that which heavy and 
brutal blows had not and could 
not have done, and he covered 
his face with his hands and broke 
into tears. 

84 



He wept long and without re- 
straint and when he had stopped 
at last, he knew it would be long, 
if ever, before he wept again. His 
eyes were wet and his chest ached, 
but these were slight shadows 
which would pass. All his body 
aches had gone. Something had 
changed in him forever. He dried 
his eyes, including the one no 
longer swollen — and he was on his 
knees and rising when he realized 
that the perry was no longer there. 

H e was aware of hunger and 
thirst, but more of thirst. He 
was aware of ^ something else, a 
sound that had been sighing in his 
ears for as long as he had been in 
this shelter which somehow the 
perry had made for him. Some- 
times the sound was as faint as a 
baby’s breath; sometimes it grew 
almost as loud as the wind which 
carried it and sometimes louder, 
the fider overbearing the steed. 
Somewhere not so very far away 
was a river and now, in this mo- 
ment of his great thirst (water 
perhaps needed to replenish that 
shed by his uncommon tears), 
great was the sound of its rushing. 

The perry had stood upright, 
but Arnten found he was obliged 
to stoop, although certainly the 
grasses and the light, light withes 
would have yielded easily to his 
head. And so, while at the curi- 
ously woven opening, stooping 
slightly and about to go out, he 
became aware of two things lying 
almost concealed by the fragrant 
grasses of the shelter’s floor. One 
was the witchery-bundle to which 
both bark basket and knife had 
been tied by deft and curious per- 

IF 




ry-knots; the other reappeared to 
him as though out of his dream- 
world between the time the Painted 
Man had beaten him to the 
ground and the time of his re- 
awakening. 

He recalled it now. When he 
had felt (and doubtless had indi- 
cated) thirst, something had 
glowed and glittered in the air be- 
fore him, touched his lips and he 
had drunk. He had in his semi- 
thoughts believed it a fragment of 
a rainbow conveying the cooling 
rainwater to his lips; or a gigan- 
tically distended drop, suffused 
with multicolored lights, distilling 
into water on his lips and tongue. 
Now he saw it to be, less fan- 
tastically but not much less won- 
drously, a flask of some sub- 
stance unfamiliar to him. Light 
passed into it and through it and 
he voiced wordless surprise on 
observing that he could see 
through it! What he saw was sub- 
ject to a gross distortion. The 
flask was iridescent as the finger- 
nails of the perry or the interior 
of . certain shells, shining with a 
multitude of colors which shifted 
and changed. And it weighed 
much less than a vessel of earthen- 
ware of the same bulk. He mar- 
veled, but did not stop for long to 
do so; he placed it in the basket 
along with the witchery-bundle 
(knife again by hip); he considered 
what its name might be. For pres- 
ent identification alone he deemed 
to call it perry ware. 

And then he stepped outside, 
ready to seek his stream. 

The sound of the river was quite 
strong outside the small grass 
shelter, shelter so slight that seem- 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



ingly a fawn could have crushed 
it by rolling over, now that the 
protecting presence of the perry 
was withdrawn. He saw no traces 
of a fawn, but pausing a moment 
and wondering what, had cropped 
the small measure of meadow, 
greenery and flowery, he saw the 
pellet droppings of the wild rams 
and — his eyes now opened — here a 
shred and there a fluff of their 
wool. His uncle had at one time 
amassed a small heap of their 
hooves (begged, doubtless, from 
hunters) which lay a long while in 
a corner, oily and strong-smelling. 
Once a nain .had come to trade 
new iron for old and the rams’ 
hooves had vanished — but for 
what consideration and for what 
purpose he had never asked and 
never learned. 

The wind brought the river 
sound stronger, nearer, to his 
ears; the wind brought a scent 
of flowers, too. He was on a 
downward slope and in a moment, 
following the land contours, he 
found himself wading through the 
blossoms — first they were under 
his feet, then around his ankles; 
then they touched the calves of his 
legs, his knee— and he brushed 
them away from his face. Glanc- 
ing at his hands, he saw blood. 

Astonished, he looked around. 
Each clump of flowers grew from 
a flashy green pod. Pod? Paw? 
There had been a wild catton in 
the village once, though not for 
long. Taking amiss being prodded 
with a stick as it lay stretching 
with paws outthrust, out from 
those paws it thrust its claws and 
struck — once — twice — at its tor- 
mentor. Who in one moment 

85 




more had crushed its skull with a 
rock. So, now: even as he half- 
halted his movements he saw a 
cluster of flowers dip down toward 
him, thrust out a sheaf of thorns 
and rake his chest with them. And 
then another. And then another. 
His arms, his legs, his back — he 
cried out, looked back, was struck 
again, flung his arms up before 
his eyes and staggered forward, 
raked with thorns and racked with 
pain. Then vinelets wrapped 
around his ankles . 

And then, for a long moment, 
nothing. 

C AUTIOUSLY he opened his 
eyes. At once his ears seemed 
to open, too. There was a deep, 
intent humming in the air. He 
saw the thorn-paws of the thickets 
sway and waver. He saw them 
droop. He saw a swarm of bees 
spread out, circle; saw, one by 
one, the thorns draw back into 
their pods; saw the flowers open 
wider. Saw each bee select its 
first flower, mount and enter, 
heard the bumbledrone alter in 
pitch and quicken. Saw each plant 
stretch itself taut, then begin a 
slow undulant motion. 

Saw himself utterly forgotten 
and ignored. 

Once again had the wary feel- 
ing of being watched. 

Saw nothing. 

Made his way unvexed to the 
water, kneeled and drank. 

Here the water rushed noisily 
over the rocks, there it eddied and 
circled silently into pools, out 
farther it glided with a joyful 
clamor along its main channel; 
then paused and murmured 

86 



thoughtfully among the reeds. 
Everywhere it sparkled — in his 
cupped hands as he lifted it to his 
mouth, as it fell in droplets from 
his face, spun around sunken logs, 
made the reeds rustle. Something 
was trying to tell him — what? The 
reeds nodded. 

Reeds. 

With a movement so quick and 
unstudied that he sank one foot in- 
to water, he stood up, spun around 
and unslung his witchery-bun- 
dle — or, more exactly, the witch- 
ery-bundle supposedly left by his 
father— and spread out its contents 
in the sunshine. Fingers trembling, 
he unsheathed the knife and cut a 
fresh reed and laid it down beside 
the one in the bundle. Except that 
one was dry and one was fresh, 
they were identical. 

Surely it was a sign. 

The medicine objects restored to 
their coverings, he considered long 
what he should do. It seemed some- 
jiow natural that he should con- 
tinue along the river; there, where 
he had found the first sign, might 
he not find at least a second? 

At first he splattered along on 
the sand flats and gravel beds, the 
mudbanks and shallows of the 
shore. The river looked so wild, so 
wide, full of mystery (and, per- 
haps, menace). Here presently the 
salmon would come surging up- 
stream, that was certain, but not 
now. What else might lie beneath 
those sounding waters was uncer- 
tain indeed. Sometimes the forest 
came right down to the brim and 
barm as though the trees would dip 
and drink. Sometimes he walked 
beneath towering banks and 
bluffs. After a while he saw the 



IF 




river divide and flow around an 
island, the main channel to the far 
side, the hither side forming a 
quiet pool, the shore of which was a 
sandy beach. On impulse he 
stopped, scooped out a hollow, 
placed into it his bundle and his 
basket with the perry thing, cov- 
ered all with his leathern kilt, 
heaped sand over it. Then he 
turned and walked into the water. 

T he shallows had been sun- 
warmed, but now the deeper 
and cooler waters began to lap 
against his legs, higher and higher, 
and he saw and felt the flesh about 
each hair creep into a tiny mound. 
He saw that hair was now growing 
thicker about his man-parts. 
Abruptly, with a slight gasp, he 
slipped deliberately beneath the 
surface and for a moment 
squatted on the bottom like a frog. 
His breath heaved against his 
chest. He opened his eyes. All was 
strange in this new world. Then 
something was suddenly familiar; 
he opened his mouth and only the 
sudden burst of bubbles reminded 
him that water and not air was his 
surrounding. He surfaced, took 
another breath, slid down once 
more. In the curious light he ex- 
changed quick glances with a small 
fish, then bent his eyes to the river 
bottom. Green light wavered in 
the green water and rippled over 
the green stones. 

Reed in his medicine bag, reed 
beside the water. 

Greenstone in his medicine-bag, 
greenstones beneath the water. 

It was the sought-for second 
sign. 

The boy-frog squatted on the 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



sand, sand clinging to him here and 
there, and looked at the other two 
small things in his budget of won- 
ders: the beechnut and the bear 
claw. Certainly the last was the 
Sign of the Bear himself, and by 
now it was plain that what the bear 
was saying was. Seek these others 
if you would seek me. Find these 
others and you will find me. In the 
way a scout leaves signs along a 
trail so that those who follow may 
see and know what his message is, 
so the Bear had left these signs— 
not indeed in any sequence set 
apart by space — so that one who 
followed after might follow farther 
yet. 

All clear, that. But what was the' 
meaning of the beechnut? Beech- 
nuts were good to eat, though per- 
haps not very good. The black 
swine of the woods were said to be 
fond of them. It wasn’t clear what 
connection the wild swine had with 
the bear. Perhaps none. He began 
to feel confused and set his 
thoughts to tracing their way as 
though through a forest path: 
Bear— black swine— beechnut- 

well enough, by working backward 
he had come at least to some cer- 
tain thing — beechnut — forest- 

trees — 

Beechnuts, whatever else they 
indicated, certainly indicated a 
beech tree. 

Not bothering to brush the sand 
from his bare legs and bottom, not 
from the leather kilt he swiftly and 
absently donned, he slung on his' 
gear once more and set off along 
the river. But this time he walked 
along the dry land and looked, not 
down, but up. And so, by arid by, 
by its silver-gray bark and its pale 

87 




green leaves, but most of all its 
height, he saw the trees he sought. 
Some long past storm or earth- 
shake, or perhaps a hidden sub- 
sidence of the ground beneath its 
roots, had inclined it at a slight an- 
gle, for it was near enough the riv- 
er for the stream in spate to have 
undercut and then covered up its 
excavating — or, perhaps the blow 
of a thunderstone had bent it; 
above the lowest branch, many 
times his own length high over his 
head a great scar was burned into 
the massive trunk. 

Once again he had the feeling of 
being watched; the feeling ebbed 
again. 

And there was certainly no sight 
nor sign of a bear. 

H IS disappointment was great. 

It would have been easy to 
stumble or falter, only that day's 
morning had he gotten up from a 
daze of illness which had lasted— 
he realized he did not know for 
how long— and he had barely 
paused for rest. He had drunk 
once. He had not eaten. Weakness 
rose inside him. What had he ex- 
pected? To find his father and, in 
finding him, an end to all mystery 
and aloneness forever? Had he ex- 
pected to find a father sitting at the 
bottom of the huge beech tree, 
ready to welcome him with warm 
embrace? Here he was, Arnten, 
and he was as alone, as hungry, as 
unknowing as he had ever been. 

What then was he to do? Slump 
behind the shelter of a bush and 
sleep and die? Weakness van- 
ished. The very force of its sensa- 
tion became a strength that blazed 
up within him and made itself felt 

88 



without. He felt his skin tingle 
with something close to rage 
against this curious father who 
had cost his mother’s life, had 
never come near to see what he had 
begotten, had left his cryptic mes- 
sages with the nains alone. A^ father 
who might be dead, long dead. 

Had he been pursuing a ghost? 
Had he himself perhaps died al- 
ready under the blows of the 
Painted Man and was now himself 
but a ghost? Did ghosts hunger? 
He allowed himself a cry of anger 
and bafflement. Then, fiercely, he 
filled his bark basket with such 
nuts and barries and leaves and 
shoots of greenfood as were close 
to hand. At a small trickle on its 
way to join the stream, he filled the 
perryware flask, stoppered its 
neck with a plug of fern. He 
arranged everything to hang be- 
hind him. Then, angry and hot- 
eyed, defiant and determined, he 
set his toes and fingers in the 
cracks and ridges of the beech 
tree’s bark and began to climb. 
For the first time he allowed him- 
self to speak his thoughts aloud. 

"‘I will go up!” he said, through 
his set teeth. ”I-will-go-up!” He 
inched up. And up. “And I will find 
out!” The bundle and basket 
dangled, swung out, bumped back, 
grew heavier. “And until I find 
out — ” he panted, dug in once 
more, advanced, advanced — “I 
‘ will not come down — ” 

He swung one leg over the lower- 
most branch, hoisted himself up, 
pressed his head to the rough 
bosom of the tree and hung on for 
very life against the wave of verti- 
go which threatened to plummet 
him to the ground. Slowly it 



IF 




passed and slowly he opened his 
eyes. The lazy wind swung into his 
face, laden with scents of the rich 
earth, of flowers and other grow- 
ing things. He looked over leagues 
of land and the swelling and falling 
away of hills, the glittering serpen- 
tine length of the river, forest for- 
ever a great green roof. And far, 
far off, so distant that he could not 
be sure, he thought he saw thread- 
thin smoke. It might have been his 
village. He thrust forward his chin 
so suddenly that he felt a creak in 
his neck and, with all his force and 
might, spat in its direction. And 
then he allowed himself to realize 
that the lightning-burn upon the 
tree, just above the branch, was ac- 
tually a tree-cave, a hollow. 

It was, he considered (with a 
shiver), too small to harbor either 
tiger or leopard; it even lacked the 
reek of a. bird’s nest. Serpents 
would not go so high. Slowly, 
cautiously, he passed himself in- 
to it. Part of the bark still lay in 
place like a shell. And, patiently 
awaiting his discovery, wedged 
with splits of wood, pi;otected 
from the worst assaults of the 
weather, was another hide-bound 
bag. Inside this was a box of 
carved wood. And in the box, 
padded with red-dyed fleece, was 
something that lay almost out- 
side all his experience. Long he 
crouched in the dim light, half- 
afraid to touch it; then his fingers 
played over the intricate carvings. 
There was mammont-ivory and 
horn of wild ram, horn of elk; there 
was bear claw, there was— there 
were many things. Parts of it 
moved around, circle-wise, when 
he turned them. Parts moved up 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



and down from holes, like little 
levers, when he touched them. 
Shapes of beasts and birds were 
carved into it. No man — nor nain 
— nor perry — had devised it. It was 
wizards’ work, and wizardry of 
witchery alone. It was a witch- 
horn, so huge and adorned and 
complex it could only be the witch- 
horn. Could only be All-caller, the 
great, fey horn. 

V . 

S EE then, in the late rays of the 
afternoon sun, while the great 
red circle still throws heat before 
descending for its slow journey 
through the Cavern Beneath The 
Earth whence .it will rise again next 
morning, a small, a very small 
Something sticking out its head 
from the bole of the huge beech 
tree. After the head, an arm, at the 
end of the arm a hand and in the 
hand — what? It is needful to come 
closer. A shaggy boy, not quite a 
new young man, excitement and 
triumph and also fear upon its 
mold-smutched face. Carefully he 
holds the great horn in both his 
dirty hands. Carefully he ex- 
amines it yet again, turning its 
turnable parts. 

Ah. Ahah. So. Here is the bear 
claw, as like to the bear claw in his 
witchery-bundle to make one 
think they had come from the same 
bear-beast. As, perhaps they had. 

The boy’s full lips protrude, 
compressed in thought. So — here 
is the bear carved in ivory upon 
the horn band. Surely it was 
meant to come in apposition to 
the bear claw. He takes a deep 
breath, fills his dusty cheeks, lifts 

89 




the horn to his lips. His eyes roll, 
his nostrils distend. 

And below upon the mossy 
ground, while the echoes of the 
great cry, part growl, part roar, 
still send the birds whirling about 
and the leaves quivering, some- 
thing comes into the open glade 
around the beech tree. Something 
comes as though the thicket were 
mere fern grass. Something comes 
crashing, comes trampling, 
comes on all fours, comes walking 
upright. Stands, stopping. Peer- 
ing this way and that. Paws and 
head swaying, issues a cry, part 
roar, part growl. Part challenge, 
part question. Puzzled. Vexed. 
Brute. Bewildered. 

Bear, 

Bear, 

Bear, 

A moment passes, or does not 
pass; endures without end. Then 
the bear coughs, grunts, sighs, 
brushes at one ear.' Gurgles deep 
within its shaggy chest. Ambles 
and shambles down to the river. 
Stands there without motion. 
Then makes gestures which no 
bear has ever before been seen to 
make— or so it seems to the watch- 
er up high. Who has ever seen a 
bear take off its skin before? Who 
has ever seen a man inside a bear 
before? Who has ever seen a man 
stride into the water and leave an 
empty bearskin lying on the bank 
behind, gaping empty, eyeholes 
looking up, sightless, at the sky? 
Has anyone—? 

— before? 

A RNTEN plucked up his talis- 
. man and, though it was the 
familiar-most of any object he had 

90 



with him, he studied it as though he 
had never seen it before. Almost, 
for that matter, he had never seen a 
bear before. Perhaps he had seen 
live bears one or two times — dead 
ones, before they had been all 
skinned and dismembered for 
food and hide, several times. The 
carving did not seem to have 
changed. The bear was still cer- 
tainly a bear — except that it still 
certainly had man’s feet. He 
could not recall that he had ever 
observed the feet of living bears, 
these must have been concealed in 
grass or underbrush, or perhaps 
he had just not been looking; like- 
lier he had had his eyes (as he 
crouched fearfully out of sight) on 
the paws of the forelimbs, on the 
fearsome jaws. Perhaps all bears 
had man’s feet. But then a clear 
picture came to him of the four 
paws of one dead bear, cut off for 
the pot— and all were pa^s, none 
truly feet. And yet, might it not be 
that bears, alive, had feet like men, 
•and that these changed at death? 
As for the bear below? Truly, he 
had not noticed. He did not know. 

Well, regardless, he knew what 
he had to do now. 

He watched the man (formerly 
bear) swimming strongly in the wa- 
ter, bobbing under, emerging with 
hair all sleek, shaking his head, 
then resuming his swim, finally 
passing out of sight around a bend 
in the river. He would certainly 
be back. But Arnten was certain 
that he would not be back at once. 
Unencumbered by any burdens, 
all of which he left in the hollow, 
he climbed carefully down; he 
ran, eyes racing between three 
places — the ground, lest he stum-

side. The birds began to fall si- 
lent. The air grew cool. Leisurely, 
the tall figure ambled up the slope 
and onto the bluff. The fish fell 
from its hands and mouth and it 
dropped backward so that it came 
to rest sitting down, legs straight 
out and arms crooked upright 
from the elbows. It gave a great 
roar of disbelief and rage.. Then it 
rose and stabbed at the mossy 
ground and took up something in 
its hands. 

The talisman, the wooden carv- 
ing .. 

Then the head rose and scanned 
the bluff, the brush, the crowded 
arbor of the forest. Abrupt growls 
came from the thick chest formed 
themselves into rage words. 

‘‘Where are you? 

“Why have you done-this? 

“ Where is my skinT" 

A voice came from somewhere 
up above, from the thickening 
darkness. “I will not answer your 
questions till you have answered 
mine.” 

“Ask, then—” 

And the other voice, a moment 
.^silent, wavering a bit, but not halt- 
ing, said, “Who are you? Who am 
I? What is next?” 

A ppropriately the back- 

Llog of the fire had come from 
the great beech tree. “Long since I 
have made fire, or eaten food 
cooked on it, or food with salt on 
it,” said Arntat. His hands, how- 
ever, seemed to have lost no skill. 
The fish had been deftly gutted, 
gilled and grilled. Salt, in a screw 
of barkrag, was still in Arnten’s 
basket. “Salmon will be better,” 
Arntat said, smacking his mouth 

92 



at the thought. “But these are well 
enough.” Sparks leaped, embers 
blackened, glowed again. Abrupt- 
ly he swiveled and faced the boy. 
“You be thinking, ‘Is it to hear 
talk of fish and fire that I’ve come 
this long way, waiting?’ Eh? I see 
it by your face, ’tis so. Arnten. I 
have waited longer than you. Be 
patient.” 

And the boy was silent. 

A nd his fullfather said, “The 
ibear is in the blood and the 
bear may take you as the bear took 
me. At any time whilest life blood 
be in you the bear may take you, 
for the bear is in the blood. If it 
takes you not, and it may not take 
you, if it takes you not then ’twill 
take your son and if hot you and 
not him then ’twill take your son’s 
or daughter’s son for sure. Let this 
be no burden. Fear it not. I’ve 
dabbled and dallied with a queen 
of love, and though ’twas joyous 
passion, yet ’twas nought com- 
pared to shambling ’mongst the 
new berries or finding honey in a 
tree or scooping forth first salm- 
on, when 1 was gone a-bearing,” 
his fullfather said. 

And he said, “Bear’s weird be 
better than man’s weird and bet- 
ter than nain’s weird. As a man 
I’ve been a chieftain high with 
lands and wealth — you may let 
your ears drop, ’tis nought to you 
M^here and nought to you what's- 
my-name-then. You were not made 
upon empty bear hide in lawful 
bedchamber, ah no, you were 
made when the bear was in the 
bearskin. My heritage to you is 
other than to my othergotten

sons. Heed and hear me now, Arn- 
ten. By my witch-bundle and by 
my shadow, sons you make out- 
side the bearskin be outside the 
bear-blood. But sons you make 
when you be a-bearing and be in- 
side the bearskin, the blood of the 
bear be in them. And if the blood of 
the bear be in them, then not run- 
ning water nor icy pools nor fire- 
hot springs can wash it out." 

And the bear was silent. 

B EECHWOOD makes hard em- 
bers and hard embers make 
long fires. Long fires make long 
tales. Long they sat there in the 
scented night and Arntat talked 
and Arnten listened and learned. 
He learned that the shift and shape 
was truly not confined to man to 
bear, that other creatures indeed 
could pair, could couple, could 
double and shift. 

Bee and salmon, wolf and bear. 
Tiger, lion, mole and hare . 

He learned of the slow growth of 
metals beneath the earth’s skin and 
the formation of amber beneath the 
sea, how amber was one of the 
things of the perries, whereas 
metal was a thing of the nains. 
Once there was a metal called 
bronze but at length it grew green 
and sick and presently it died. 
Now there was iron. 

’The sickness of iron is red," 
said Arnten, "and iron is dying." 
Red glints in the ashes. Reflec- 
tions in the eyes of the watchers. 

"Aye, eh," muttered Arntat. 
"The sickness of iron is red." He 
swung up his head and his hand 
gripped his son’s. "What say thee, 

ARNTEN OF ULTIAAATHULE 



bear’s boy? *Iron is dying?* 
What?" 

That he, knowing so much, 
should not know this, for several 
heartbeats kept Arnten silent 
and astonished. Then he saw pic- 
tures in his mind: one: one: then he 
saw things moving, heard the nain 
tell of years since "Bear" was by 
them seen. Arnten said, "You 
have been long inside the bear- 
skin, then, and that long you’ve not 
seen iron?" 

Still the hand gripping his did 
not move. "7ro/i is dyingl True, 
true, many springtimes I have 
caught and killed the great salmon 
and many summertimes I have 
climbed for honey in the honey- 
trees and in the rocky clefts. Many 
falltimes have I eaten the last of 
the frost-touched fruits and the 
sweet flesh of nuts. And many win- 
tertimes have I felt the bearsleep 
come upon me and felt the numb- 
ness grow inside my head and 
sunk into the lair till the snows 
grow thinner. Aye. Eh. I can count 
the time only by counting your 
time. You are barely a man. And 
the last iron 1 had seen, the last 
iron I had thought of, I wrapped 
well the iron knifelet in my witch- 
ery-bundle and hid it well for thee. 
May it be sick?" 

Arnten did not mind the grip up- 
on his hand. He crouched against 
the crouching body of his fullfa- 
ther. He rested on that puissant 
flesh which had made his own and 
which was now his present as well 
as his past. Defying mankind 
and beastkind and time and the 
night, he let himself recline 
against the great rough beast which 
was his father and he let his hand 

93 




recline in that great rough paw. 
Quietly, almost drowsily he said, 
“That witchery-knife alone is not 
sick. But all other iron is sick.“ 
And he muttered, “The nains,” 
and he muttered of the nains. And 
he sighed, “The king — “ and he 
sighed words of the king. And al- 
most he fell asleep, comforted by 
the rough, warm body and its 
rough and powerful smell. Then 
the body moved, releasing his 
hand, and a sound which was al- 
most a cry and almost a groan 
rumbled and broke loose from 
that strong fatherbody by the em- 
bers. 

“/row!

Almost he flew awake. He slid 
down so that he might sland up. 
The day had been long and there 
was still much to talk about. The 
day had begun with the mammont 
hunt and he had run far and he had 
been hurt and nains and perries 
and Painted Men pursued him 
and he ran along the river and now 
the long long day was over and he 
had nevermore again to run to bolt 
to flee and Irani Sick ironl The 
wizards] and The king] sounded 
their names in the darkness. And 
the embers slid down because 
they were tired and the embers 
slipped beneath the ashes and the 
. embers slept. 

In the morning the embers were 
awake again and spitting and flar- 
ing at the meat that turned, spitted 
and smoking. Arntat was still 
crouched by the fire as though he 
had never left it and as though the 
meat had come at his bidding and 
obediently slipped out of its skin 

94 



and onto the spit. Arntat yawned 
hugely and glanced at Arnten and 
it seemed as though his teeth were 
still the tushes and the fangs of 
Bear, his eyes still Bear's eyes so 
small and cunning and sharp, his 
blunt face still Bear's muzzle and 
his hairy hands with long thick 
nails— The yawn closed with a 
snap. 

The man said, “There was the 
lone one of you?'' 

“The—'" 

“Sometimes a she kindles with 
twain. Or more. My get, by your 
dam—'' 

“Only me, as I ever heard. I nev- 
er knew her. Uncle said she 
drowned. Was mad.'' 

Arntat grunted. “It was time for 
it to be done and I was there and 
she was there and 'twas done, so. If 
not she, another. If not me, an- 
other. If not she and me, then not 
thee.'' He took the spit from its 
fc^ks and rested the savory roast, 
dribbling, on the grass. “So. The 
lone one of you. Called me from 
my bearguise.'' He seized his son 
by his downy shoulders. “Hid 
from me my bearskin.'' Son re- 
sisted, wordlessly, was pressed 
down nontheless. “Carried off 
with him my token. Found the 
nain. Found me. Called me from 
my bearguise. Stole away my 
bearskin. The lone one of you.'' 
Arnten was on his back, flat. “Am 
I to regret 'twasn’t twins? Or be 
one of such enoujgh?'' The single 
hand quivered the boy belly as one 
would a pup's. Then moved, one 
hand, two hands, tore the roasted 
meat apart, slapped on part still 
sizzling on the place the hand had 
been— boy leapt up, yelp- 

IF 




ing — bared his teeth and began to 
eat. 

Boy teeth shining sharp in quick- 
closed mouth. Boy hand rubbing 
belly. Boy snout smelling savory 
food. Boy cub by bear man, tear- 
ing meat from bone. 

Still eating when father got up 
and strode off, he followed at quick 
pace, still holding his own unfin- 
ished portion. '‘Arn!” he said. 
“Arntat! Bearfather!” 

Bearfather growled over his 
shoulder. 

“The hide! The horn! The witch- 
ery-bundle! Shall I fetch?” 

Arntat growled, “The hide? 
Leave it be. I’ll go no more abear- 
ing for now. The horn? Leave it be. 
Rather than call wrong, call none 
for now. The witcher-bundle? As 
you want.” And he melted into 
the shadows of the all-circling 
forest. Arnten followed, think- 
ing and eating as he went. Claw 
and reed and stone and nut, he had 
read their message and read them 
rightly; he could part with them 
for now. The hide with its med- 
icine signs he needed not now. For 
a moment he begrudged the 
knife, the good knife of good iron. 
He took a longing look at the 
slightly slant and towering beech 
tree, casting a long shadow in the 
morning sun as it had cast in the 
evening. They were ail safe up 
there in the hollow of the hidey- 
hoie. And there, safely, let them 
bide, then. 

Still eating, he slipped after his 
father into the dappled surface of 
the forest. 

A rntat did not precisely lin- 
ger, he did not exactly daily, 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



neither did he rush ahead with 
great speed, nor slink through the 
woods. Some sort of game was be- 
ing played. For neither did Arn- 
ten go so fast as he might. It was 
the game, then, that each should 
generally hold the other in sight, 
but only generally. And some- 
times the bigger one would sud- 
denly hide himself and as sud- 
denly reveal himself when the 
smaller paused to look around, 
then proceed as though he had not 
been hidden at all. Before long 
they had developed many aspects 
to this game and little tricks and 
presently they were again and 
again filled with silent laughter at 
each other. Through many a clear- 
ing and burn and along the paths 
they played their game, sometimes 
’Tat leaping along a fallen tree as 
lightly as a squirrel, at least once 
’Ten dropping several leaves be- 
fore being realized and looked up 
at. 

It lasted most of the morning 
and might have lasted much long- 
er, but then Arnten, running 
noiselessly around a great lichen- 
studded boulder, ran full tilt into 
flesh which only in that first sec- 
ond he thought was his father’s. A 
swift blow and an angry word un- 
deceived him before his eyes 
did — he who had for all morning 
dropped even the memory of 
blows and angry words — and, as he 
tried to scramble to his feet, tried 
to turn his head to see who it was, 
tried (all these at once) to run away 
any which way, someone grabbed 
his arm and twisted it. Only then 
did he cry out. 

The man’s face had the look of 
one who kicks a dog not to be rid of 

95 




it but for the pleasure of kicking it. 
Then the face changed and the arm 
released him, raised its spear; the 
mouth that cursed him gave a sick 
croak as something snapped which 
was not the spear, Arntat was 
there. Arntat was holding, em- 
bracing, Arntat was crushing. 
Ugly sounds of witless fright, 
then, from this other’s mouth. 
Blood gushing from that mouth. 
And then other men, many other 
men, spears and clubs and then 
ropes, Arntat down on one knee. 
Arntat releasing limp and bleed- 
ing body, Arntat clawing out for 
a grip upon another. Arnten bit- 
ing, beating. Arntat down. Arn- 
tat growling, roaring. Men curs- 
ing as much in fright as wrath. 
Arntat down. Arntat suddenly 
silent, save for his bxeathing in 
the sudden silence. Arntat bound. 
Arnten, too. 

And after some moments of 
gasping, recovering breath, slow- 
ing hearts, hissing of pain, some- 
one said as though to a question 
none had heard, “1 don’t know — 1 
don’t know— Eh? Ah? Nains? No\ 
Nor bears — ” 

Another voice. “We be the 
king’s men. Let the king say what.'^ 
And others, others. “Aye! Ah! 
Let the king say what!” 

VI 

T he red-sickness of all iron 
fiamed into a plague. At first 
whispered, it was now said openly 
that the king himself had caught 
Vhe evil and the ill. Indeed, it 
seemed to be so. Red blotches 
were seen about his face and hands 
and all his face and limbs and 



frame looked wasted and hol- 
lowed. His voice cracked and 
croaked. His hands shook. In the 
mornings he groaned and stag- 
gered. In the late afternoons his 
eyes would roll up and his eyelids 
roll down and he folded his legs 
and lay where he happened to be, 
servants hastily bringing furs 
and fleeces and lifting him and set- 
tling him again. For the length of 
time it took for the shadow of the 
sun-staff to move over two stones 
the king at such times lay as one 
dead. And in the late night hours he 
tended to enrage easily, to shout 
and strike out and to cast things. 

But in the early and middle af- 
ternoon and in the early and mid- 
dle night times he was as well as ev- 
er in those days he was well. As to 
the first of these periods, it was as- 
sumed he was passing well, for his 
voice could be heard talk- 
ing — talking, not groaning, not 
•yelling — and as for the second of 
these periods, it was then that he 
held such gatherings as he held 
and saw such outsiders as he saw. 
In the red light of the hearth all 
men may look reddened and the 
dancing shadows may make all 
men look gaunted. 

But not all men hide themselves 
in daylight. 

Day by day the couriers trouped 
in. Night by night the king himself 
would see them and let himself be 
seen by them and from them re- 
ceive the tidings which he had, of 
course, already received; for did 
he not sit upon his stool or lie up- 
on his pallet behind the reed cur- 
tain while the courier made re- 
port upon the other side? Tirlag- 
usak, grown stout and gray in his

service as a first captain of the 
king’s men, generally stood forth 
as the couriers came in, each with 
the strip of white bark cloth bound 
about his head, which even toddle- 
babes knew signified / am the 
king's mouth and / am the king's 
eyes and I am the king's ears. 
Delay me not — and if I need aid, 
aid me. 

“Thirty-deer Hill,” the courier 
might say. Or: “Whalefish Point.” 

Tirlag-usak puts out his hand. 
“Tally,” he says. “Why so slow?” 

The courier hands over the cut 
and carved piece of wood. He pants 
to show how hard' he has run. Of 
late there had been increasingly 
less sham in this. Tirlag-usek, of 
course, knows whence every one of 
the couriers has come but he sees 
if the tallystick fits the proper one 
from his own box. 

“Report sightings,” he directs. 
“Swiftly.” 

“Good omens from the flocks of 
birds,” says the courier. It would 
not do to report No sighting. 

“Eat. Wash. Rest. Return after 
evening meal.” 

The courier retires, sweating but 
relieved. His tongue may be the 
king’s tongue but that need not pre- 
vent it’s being cut. 

Behind the reed curtain the 
king’s lips writhe, the king's hands 
move convulsively. The king’s 
face grows redder yet. The red- 
sickness increases fast upon him. 
And the red-sickness increases 
fast upon the iron. The courier 
has gone. Tirlag-usak remains 
standing. From behind the reed 
curtain comes an anguished whis- 
per. 

“Iron? IronT" 



“The ears of the king hear all 
things,” says the grizzled first cap- 
tain. After just a breath, he says, 
“The king already has heard that it 
is not better. It is not even as it 
was.” After three breaths should 
come the groan or hiss which has 
come to mean Go\ but Tirlag-usak 
today, after only two breaths, re- 
peats, “The ears of the king hear 
all things.” And says further, 
“The king has already heard that 
ten of his men who went north in a 
search for nains have this day re- 
turned with captives.” 

^^UhhT 

“One great and one small, as the 
king already has heard. The eyes of 
the king have already seen them 
and it may be that the king’s eyes 
have already recognized one of 
them as the king’s kin to whom the 
king's mouth will speak more 
words.” 

Tirlag-usak had spoken some- 
what more rapidly than usual. Now 
he waits for the space of many 
breaths and he hears each of these 
breaths from behind the reed cur- 
tain. But no question now comes 
from behind the reed curtain and 
what now comes thence at last is a 
cry of such agony and terror and 
rage that almost the hand of Tir- 
lag-usak touches the woven reed 
barrier — almost he stoops to lift 
it. But he hears other feet, other 
voices, babble and whisper and 
shuffle and sigh. Then nothing. 
Then, only then, he departs. , 

Later, in the enclosure where 
they were penned, Arnten sud- 
denly looked up. Arntat, his fa- 
ther, did not pause in his sham- 
bling and shuffling, shuffling and 
shambling, back and forth and

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 




back and forth, head weaving like 
a snake’s head from side to side. It 
seemed he did not share his son’s 
thought, a sudden one which 
projected into the boy’s mind a 
picture of the mandrakes danc- 
ing to the sound of the small drum 
in his old uncle’s medicine hut. 
The recollection was so clear 
that the boy sat and watched it in- 
side his head for some time. 

M ERED-DELFIN beat the 
small drum and his man- 
drakes, which were the mandrakes 
of the king and queen, dqnced their 
witcheryrdance and Mered-delfin 
watched them from the corner of 
his eyes and the king and queen 
watched them full front. Every feel- 
ing* moved across the king’s face, 
none at all disturbed the- face of 
the queen. The mandrakes moved 
and the mandrakes moved and 
they mimed and mimed and they 
danced. At first, coming forth 
from their carved wood chest, the 
mandrakes’ motion kept time to 
the tune of the witchery-drumlet. 
But after a while and after 
Mered-delfin had sung to them 
and hummed to them and chanted 
to them, whistled and drummed to 
them, then the pattern of their 
moving changed. They led and 
Mered-delfin followed, his fin- 
gers and his palms straining to 
keep up with them, to maintain 
the proper tune and rhythm upon 
the drumhead made from the skin 
entire of a dwarf deer slain with- 
out bruise or blood. 

At length, when they had begun 
to repeat themselves and no chant- 
ings or whistlings could prevail 
upon them to enact any new pat- 

98 



tern, Mered-delfin drummed them 
back and dancing they went, 
throwing up their root-thin arms 
they danced backward upon their 
root-thin legs, and climbed back in- 
to their box at last and closed its lid 
upon them. 

Thus the dancing mandrakes. As 
for the watching mandrakes, they 
remained in the outer court and 
would shriek, beshrew, if so much 
as an unbidden shadow fell. And 
there they muttered and watched. 

The chief witcherer licked his 
mouth and wiped his arm across 
his sweat-slick face and quickly 
rolled his eyes. The other two were 
not looking at him. Swiftly he set 
his countenance into its accept- 
ed lines. He softly clicked his fin- 
gernail against the side of the 
drum. They looked up toward 
him. 

''It is as we have seen, it is as I 
have said, they have enacted the 
lineaments of the dream and 
mimed for us the finding and the 
sounding of All-Caller, the Great 
Fey Horn — ” 

The king grimaced and showed 
his sharp teeth- As he leaned for- 
ward on his hands and arms he 
seemed to crouch on all fours. 
"And where, then,’’ he asked, "is 
the great good which you said this 
dream portended for me?’’ 

Mered-delfin parted his thin 
beard from lips and mouth and 
dared to grin. The very daring of 
the deed made the king draw back, 
somewhat relax the tenseness of 
his pose. Witch-Mered thrust out 
his hand and arm and described a 
quarter-circle in the air and let 
the hand extend two fingers in a 
point. "Can it be that the sounding 

IF 




of All-Caller has lured from 
across the all-circling sea an 
enemy who is not to be named? 
And with him a son begat in 
treacherous exile? Lured them 
thence and it must be alone?” 

His master’s grimace grew into a 
snarl. His eyes blazed red. He 
seemed like a creature of the for- 
est about to hurl itself from its 
den. He gave off the rank and bit- 
ter smell of denizen and den. “I 
shall kill them!” His voice rose into 
a howl. ‘‘I shall have them killed! 
They shall be killed for me and be- 
fore me!” Jiis tongue lolled out of 
his mouth. “Limbs broken — ” the 
howl prolonged itself—” im- 
paled — ” 

“Slayer of Bull Mammonts — ” 

“Greatpire Wolf—” 

“ — disemboweled — ” 

The last word hung, upon the air. 
The Orfas panted. His sides 
heaved. He flung up his head and 
again he howled. In this howl there 
were no words, but it rang with a 
lust for vengeance long delayed. 
In his narrow pen Arntat heard it 
and stopped in his mindless pac- 
ing and hearkened to it and his 
arms moved slightly and he stood 
still. The nain-thralls heard it in 
their tunnels and turned their 
massy heads on their short necks. 
Servants heard it and shivered and 
tremored. King’s men felt flesh 
pucker and hair rise and let their 
eyes roll to each other, and al- 
most they clean forgot the tales of 
the ill-struck king, cloistered and 
shabby and sick and old. 

“The Orfas,” they whispered to 
one another. 

“The wolf! The wolf! 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



“King Orfas! Great Wolf! King 
Wolf! 

^^—King 

L ong the wolf-king lay upon 
his side, panting, wet with 
sweat. Then he jerked his head and 
in two silent bounds Mered-war- 
lock was crouching at his head. 
Said the king, “Not kill him?” 

Said the witcherer, “Not yet.” 
Said the wolf-king, “When, 
then?” 

Said the sage, “When the curse 
is canceled. When iron is well.” 

The king said no word. His eyes 
rolled up and his lids rolled down. 
He nodded. He touched his sage’s 
hand. His queen kneeled beside 
him and he touched her face. The 
words last spoken hung upon the 
air. 

And the words unspoken, too. 

A RNTEN and his father were 
. allowed to toil together; one of 
the guards had said with a guffaw 
that the two of them were barely 
equal to one nain. Iron was the 
nains’ heritage and though they 
had been used to it in all its work- 
ings at their own speed and though 
timed toil was inhospitable Jp 
them, still the nature of mining 
was not strange. But it was all 
strange, strange and fell, to Arntat 
and his son. Only the unswerving 
friendship of the nains and the fact 
of his and his son’s being still to- 
gether at all relieved the toil. And 
worse by far than the toil was the 
circumstance of bondage, of con- 
finement, of life now being 
limited to a set series of motions 
within severely limited space. All 
thralldoms are one same thrall- 

99 




dom. The unremitting labor of 
the toil, the unremitting oppres- 
sion of the guards, the ill food, 
cramped space, uncleanliness, 
lack of hope, dull hatred, scanted 
sleep, infinite heaviness of 
spirit — are not these the features 
of all thralldoms? 

‘‘It is harder. Bear, for thee than 
we,” the nains said. ‘‘The tunnel 
fits we as the hoodskin fits the piz- 
zle.” 

“Then I stoop,” he said. 
Stooped, grunted. “I have stooped 
before.” But his eyes were sunk- 
en. And his forehead bruised and 
scabrous, for he did not always 
think to stoop, nor they to warn 
him. 

And the nains said, ‘‘It is hard- 
er, Bear, for thee than we. We be 
used to the smell of iron dust and 
fire and have forgot the smell of 
grass and waterflows.” 

‘‘Then I shall grow used to this 
and shall forget that other, too,”' he 
said. But he did not grow used to it, 
he often was coughing, and there 
was that in his eyes and on his face 
Avhich seemed to show that he was 
not forgetting. And one night 
when the begrudged fire burned 
low and the older nains had begun 
f% creep into their sleepy-holes and 
kick the crushed bracken-fern in- 
to a brief semblance of soft- 
ness — at last that night his voice 
burst loud with, “But I cannot for- 
get! No! No! I cannot forget!” 

The older nains crept out from 
their sleepy-holes, greasy-sided, 
fetid, close. They laid their hands 
on his, and on his knees and arms 
and legs, their huge and calloused 
hands. And a few dfd so to Arnten, 
who had crept close to his father; 

100 



and the heavy nain-hands were 
light and gentle. “Since thee can- 
not forget. Bear, cease to try,” 
they said. “And speak it out to 
we.” And the Bear spoke. 

Not — at first — of the free life of 
sun and stars, grass and water- 
flows, salmon hunts and honey 
thefts, of timeless days and world 
without walls. These all, it 
seemed, though well remembered 
in general, had become as it were 
a design bordered in dyed grass- 
es around a basket rim — turn it, 
turn it, now faster, now slower, 
and see the same sequences fol- 
lowing forever; man’s mind no 
longer holding in differentiat- 
ing recollection any one se- 
quence from any other like it — so 
it seemed, when by and by his talk 
took up those days. 

t 

B ut he began with other days, 
when he was a man’s child 
among other mens’ children, he 
one and Orfas another and Orfas 
a little older. Not much differ- 
ence in age and little if any in sta- 
tus, even after both presently 
realized that Orfas was in a way 
an uncle — that Orfas’ father was 
the other’s grandfather, the 
other’s father Orfas’ half-brother. 
Both playing and 'tumbling and 
chasing dogs in one familiar yard 
onto which opened (so it seemed) 
the doors of many houses, yet all of 
them family houses. In those days 
they were but two among many 
and each father had several sons 
and neither more of a rival to 
each other than either was to any 
others. All the sons and cousins 
and uncles of that age had cast 
their reed practice spears and 

IF 




awkwardly fletched their boy-ar- 
rows and went creeping and hunt- 
ing in the mock-forests of the 
great yard. The years had flown 
away like the wild swans fly away, 
yet never do the absent years re- 
turn as do the absent swans. 

Boys had grown to men, passed 
through ordeal and initiation, 
learned which was their witchery- 
beast, dreamed medicine dreams, 
had found women and knew the 
milk of life to be within them. The 
hunt had ceased to be play and of- 
ten man had fought with man, not 
for proving or for pleasure but for 
very life; and some had taken life 
and some had lost it. Some of all 
that company of boykin had died 
young beneath the feet or claws or 
within the jaws^ of wild beasts or 
had been dragged down beneath 
the waves by waterkelpies or by 
fierce hippotames. Others had 
made themselves house-holders 
and gotten children while still 
barely bearded. Some had sought 
a name and fame by captaining 
pursuits of whalefish or were- 
whales, tree-tigers, or had gone 
north into the snows to hunt the 
wild leopard. One had been 
allured by the bewitchments of 
the Painted Men (whose skin must 
not be seen). 

“There was a certain great tree 
whose wide-spreading branches we 
all climbed as boys. It became our 
gathering place and remained so 
even when we were men and 
gathered there more seldom. But 
whenever we so returned, there 
we went and there we looked to 
meet with our comrades and our 
kin of our age. I had been away and 
gone a full handful of years, and I 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



returned and sat beneath the tree 
upon a seat made by an out-thrust 
of rootburl. There I sat and long I 
sat and many passed but none were 
of our old company. And then 
came one whose shape 1 knew, 
whose walk I knew, even before I 
kenned his face. 

“ItwasOrfas. 

“He came and I remembered it 
was right that I should rise be- 
cause he was my father’s brother 
of the half-blood, and so we at 
some length stood and faced each 
other. He had the slight sem- 
blance of a smile on his face. For a 
while we said no word. And then I 
said, ‘It seems, then, that of all on- 
ly we two remain, in this corner 
of the Land of Thule.’ 

“And he said, ‘It seems that this 
be one too many,’ and although I 
did not deeply consider on his 
words, still, a particle of them must 
have touched upon a particle in 
me — at once I said, ‘Then let us 
both be gone and let us make a 
compact and both be gone to- 
gether.’ We made our compact 
and prepared a boat and formed 
an alliance with others, gathered 
our gear and store and had the 
witcherers discover the best day 
to depart. South-south across the 
all-encircling sea we went, to the 
barbar-lands we made our course, 
sometimes along the coast and 
sometimes up the great rivers. 
Betimes we traded and betimes 
we sold the service of our swords 
and spears, fighting now for one 
town or tribe or chieftan, now for 
another; and betimes we shared 
the plunder-spoil or betimes we 
kept it all, as it had been agreed, or 
as it fell out. And then for a while 

101 




we went a-roving and a-robbing 
as we would and as we willed, until 
the durancy of our compact fell 
away to expire, and there was on- 
ly a handful of day-sticks left in 
the tally-bag. One of us had a 
dream to take a certain course 
with our three vessels (as by then 
they were) and reach on the third 
day an island all suitable for our 
needs, which was done, and the day 
we broke the third stick we made 
our landfall and the island was as 
had been seen.” 

E veryone has in his mind 
the image presented by story 
and by song, of all the troves and 
treasures piled in one great glittery 
heap, “dragon-high, dragon- 
bright, sparkling while its seekers 
fight — ’’but it is not always thus in 
fact, nor was it so this time. 

Said he who had dreamed the 
dream, “Think it clearly for your- 
selves. Will he who lives alone to 
claim it be wanting to lug it all 
back to the ships again?” There 
was a burst of laughter in which 
was no sound of love or warmth. It 
was done so, that the wealth was 
divided between two ships, which 
were dismasted, and the third was 
broken up at once to make a deck 
for the complete vessel, which 
was a double-hulled raft of sorts, 
with a single mast. Then each man 
set to sharpening his weapons 
and mostly he sat alone, with no 
more than now and then a side- 
ways glance to estimate the 
strength or calculate the skill of 
another; and sometimes the oth- 
er, on whom his direct look might 
fall had been his near-comrade; 
and some seemed to repent great- 

102 



ly of this compact and to wish 
themselves away. 

But only one would live to go 
away. 

The fighting field was laid out 
and deeply trenched around, and 
then the lots were drawn to select 
the two for the first combat. Or- 
fas drew one of the black pebbles 
and a younger man, often a sing- 
er of merry songs, drew the other. 
He sang no song now but muttered 
charms as they stepped to the cen- 
ter of the field but Orfas did not 
open his mouth as they faced each 
other. Then all the rest shouted 
Ho\ and in that instant Orfas spat 
in his opponent’s eye and as he 
blinked, dumbstruck, Orfas 
rushed him from the side of that 
eye and with his axe he split 
through his collarbone. The man 
fell backward with a great croak- 
ing cry. Orfas kicked up the fallen 
one’s kilt and again he spat, now 
upon his foe’s manhood, saying, 
“That is for the wench you stole of 
me a two months’ since!” and then 
he brought the axe down once 
again. 

And went and took his rest 
across the trench until every other 
man should have fought once — and 
then he would again be subject to 
the lots. 

Not every vector lived to draw a 
second lot. 

Now — said Arntat — I had killed 
my man and had killed my second 
man. And as I sat resting and 
waiting I chanced to feel an eye 
strong upon me and 1 looked up 
and around and I saw that it was 
the eye of Orfas. It came to me 
that I had felt it heavy upon me be- 
fore but had not fully thought 

IF 




about it. And now all at once I re- 
collected what had been said that 
time we met after long apart, un- 
der the tree of meeting; I saying, 

It seems that only we two remain, 
and he saying. This be one too 
many. It came to me so late as then 
that he had long hated me, and I 
suppose that inside me that one 
particle must have returned his 
feeling or I would not have an- 
swered as I did. 

Well! So be it! I knew then that 
we two would be the last to stand 
upon our feet and fight for life and 
for treasure, winner take all. It was 
our weird. I do not know at what 
point in our lives he had begun to 
hate me — or why. Perhaps he him- 
self did not know it till he saw me 
there under the tree of meeting. 
Perhaps until then he had thought 
I would not come back, that I was 
dead; it may be that the deaths of 
others of our line had gradually 
or suddenly given him hope that 
he would be chief over all our 
line — and, as our line has always 
been a line high in Thule, he may 
have bethought him that he might 
some day be highest of all in 
Thule. 

If I were not. 

T he fire barely lived at all. 

Then someone blew briefly on 
the dull embers and someone 
placed an armful of bracken on it. 
“Eh, ah, Bear,“ an older nain said, 
“Well I remember when the old 
asking began to be heard again. 
By what three things is a king 
model and answered, By strength, 
by magic, and by fortune. He who 
paid the nain-fee then, I shall say 
plain, was not the worst as ever 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



paid it. But even kings live not for- 
ever. And in all that struggle 
which came then. Bear, some say 
thee helped the Orfas, he being 
near of kin. Some say thee befoed 
him and would have been king in- 
stead. I ask not and care I not. 
Thee has ever been the friend of 
nains, as nains have ever been the 
friends of thee. The Orfas winned 
the kingship and was made king as 
kings be made and he paid the 
nain-fee — then — full and fair. But 
the nains be feed to work in iron, 
not to set snares for bears — or 
men. We saw thee in the wildwood 
dwelling where never manfolk 
dwell at all, we told it to each other 
and we told it to the forge, but 
never did we tell it to the king.” 

“I know.” 

“Such rewards he offered, and 
such afflictions he threatened as 
never did we hear before.” 

“I know.” 

“That bitter winter when the 
birds fell frozen from the sky and 
the all-circling sea itself was 
turned to ice, far as ever eye could 
see, when no track nor trace could 
be concealed upon the snowy 
ground and no snow fell more from 
the fast frozen sky; then the Orfas 
came for thee, for Witch-Mered 
did plot it out for him.” 

“I know.” 

“Corby-Mered. Mered-Crow.” 
“His witcheries espied thee out, 
we knew and said nought, he saw 
and said all. With a many troops of 
men they came for thee, and cir- 
cled around where thee had gone. 
Where could thee hide? We 
thought it woe, we whispered low, 
we told it to the forge, but nains 
mix not in the affairs of man- 

103 




folk — would that man would mix 
as little in the life of nainfolk! 
They circled all about where thee 
had gone, they scanned the still, 
unbroken snow, they drew their 
lines inward as wading fishermen 
draw their nets, they met face to 
face and arm to arm in the center; 
b\xi Arn they never met.” 

“I know.” 

He said, “I know. I know.” 
Crouching in the darkness 
marred by feeble flicks of flames, 
he said, “I cannot forget.” A pris- 
oner, he remembered himself a 
fugitive; though it had seemed bit- 
ter then, now long later it revealed 
its sweetnesses. And he could not 
forget. 

The nains sighed and they sighed 
for him, not for themselves. The 
king had sought him jhen and 
found him not, and hunted him 
again and found him not. King and 
king's men hunted a man, but he 
whom they hunted was a man no 
more. He had become a bear. 

VII 

D ay followed day and toil fol- 
lowed toil and slowly the great 
rust increased. Its pace was not 
steady. At times it had seemed to 
leap onward like a dread grass fire 
in the dry season, at times it had 
seemed to pause as though tired. 
Now for some long while, the red- 
sickness had gone at so slow a step 
that some did not perceive that it 
still continued until, perhaps, an 
axe-head crumbled as it met the 
wood it could not cleave, or an 
arrowhead collapsed into a pinch 
of russet dust when the quiver was 
moved. And many still had not re- 

104 



alized that the pest pursued its 
course. 

But the king was not among the 
many. 

It was not only that he asked or 
caused to be asked, “How goes it 
with iron?” of those who came 
from far off. He asked always, in 
hope of hearing what he would 
hear; but he was not content only 
to ask. The king had great store of 
iron, not in the armories alone, but 
in his own chambers, very near to 
him. Several times a day, if he did 
not go to iron things, he had iron 
things come to him. He looked, he 
tested, poked, probed, he scraped 
iron with his fingernails and he 
scaled with instruments which were 
not of iron. The king knew the rate 
each day at which the plague pur- 
sued. He knew it and he sickened 
from his knowing. 

“Will you not leave off?” the 
queen asked him with a sigh. 

“How can 1?” he asked, with a 
sick and sidelong look. 

There was almost a proverb in 
those days: The queen grows not 
old. Some had grown up hearing it 
and thought it a saying applied to 
all queens; that women who held 
the queenly seat, by virtue of the 
power of that office did not age: 
But in truth it was a saying which 
had not been heard before, al- 
though likely enough that any 
woman spared the labors of hoe- 
ing and bark-beating and preparing 
hides and all such toilsome work, 
who had but to put on her clothes 
and jewelry and suckle her chil- 
dren — and sometimes not even 
such slight, light tasks as that— 
likely enough that thus a woman, 
queen or not, would grow not old 

IF 




so soon and certain as the gener- 
ality of her sex. 

Still, the saying was a new one, 
as sayings go. Here lies the truth 
— quite early had her hair turned 
the color of a winter’s sky, quite 
early and quite suddenly. There- 
fore most of Thule became aware 
of her when she in some measure 
already wore the mantle of more 
years than she had. And also her 
manner had already then become 
grave and withdrawn. Since the 
mass of folk did not observe her 
slowly losing what were common 
tokens of youth, gradually the say- 
ing came to be heard: The queen 
growls not old. 

Some held this to be due to her 
command of witchery- wisdom. On- 
ly a few, and they not often and 
never openly, were lately begin- 
ning to whisper that she sipped the 
cup of the king’s own years, that 
she stayed one age while he aged 
swiftly. And at least the very last 
part of this was true. 

“You can leave off by leaving 
off.” she said. Only a very few lines 
were to be seen upon her face 
— about the eyes, and about the 
corners of the mouth — but none at 
all upon her upper lip. “Rest upon 
your cot or couch and let others 
examine iron while you watch. And 
watch not too closely, that is to 
say, too nearly. Iron is sorely ill. 
And you are not too well.” 

A slight snarl moved his mouth, 
but did not move it much; his next 
words and the inclination of his 
head showed how little the snarl 
was meant for her. “You are ever 
gentle of me in word and deed — but 
I know well what they say out 
there— ihdX} have caught the iron- 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



rot. Perhaps I have. But if I have 
caught it, I have it — so what good 
then be distance? Or any precau- 
tion?” He moved nonetheless to his 
couch. Muttered, “If iron die, then 
I die. If I die, let iron die. But let 
we not die, either, nor the barbar 
folk come swarming — savages 
from over the circling sea—” He 
let himself down on his couch and 
leaned on the pile of prime, pelts 
sewn in bags and stuffed with the 
downy breast feathers of swans. 
His eyes were sunken and closed. A 
long breath shuddered and sighed 
in his throat and fluttered his 
cracked and blistered lips. 

Suddenly his eyes flew open. 
Those of the queen were fixed up- 
on his. “Why do you think he came 
back alone? Or did he?” Without 
giving her time to reply he rolled 
his head back and forth and 
clenched his hands. “Only because 
Mered-delfin feels that this traitor 
may somehow prove the key to the 
cure of iron do I spare his life.” His 
teeth showed and sounded. “I 
should never have spared it 
before.” Another thought worked 
its way across his ravaged face and 
the queen drew near and kneeled 
beside him. “Mered-delfin— he 
said that you must prepare to wear 
many masks and to make many 
journeys.” She gave a slow, single 
•nod. The king said, “Wear one 
mask now. Make one short jour- 
ney.” 

F rom time to time word came, 
presumably from the king, to 
switch the mining from the open pit 
to the tunnels or from the tunnels 
to the open pit. Evidently neither 
change had perceptibly improved 

105 




the fate of iron, but from time to 
time still came directions — change. 

Thus on this day the mattocks 
swung up and down upon the en- 
circling path which went around 
and around about the great deep 
pit, up from its narrow center to its 
wider rim, digging deeper into the 
walls of ruddy ore. Up the tools 
went, paused, still scattering dust; 
down they fell, a grunt, a thud, and 
some were of bone and some were 
of stone, but none were of iron. 
Arnten had been detailed to carry 
the yoke with its brace of leathern 
water buckets and a drinking horn 
slung about his neck on a thong. 
For the most part he kept his eyes 
on the uneven footing of the 
circling path, but when he paused 
to allow one of the nain-thralls to 
drink he allowed himself to look 
up. The yoke had bitten into his 
flesh, but he preferred it out here 
in the open pit. He thought they all 
must. It was like being inside a 
great clay pot, one only partly 
made; the pot-woman had rolled 
the strip of red clay between her 
palms and coiled it into the rough 
shape of the pot-to-be, but she had 
not yet taken up her shell or shard 
to smooth it. The pit was like a 
great clay pot and they were inside 
it, small as mandrakes. 

Of course, pots had no light blue 
lids on them. Against the rim, out- 
lined, stood the gXiards. His eyes 
swung around. The nain groaned 
gratefully between gulps. All about 
the rim the guards stood at equal 
intervals, weapons sticking up like 
fishnet sticks. But at one place 
there were a number of them 
grouped together. They moved and 
he saw that one of them had no 

106 



spear, no club, seemed to be 
dressed differently. Dressed more. 

The nain gave one last groan, 
looked enviously at the rest of the 
water in the pails, licked his mouth 
and bristles and put the flat of his 
huge hand between the boy’s shoul- 
ders below the yoke the nain had 
effortlessly lifted into place, gently 
shoved him on his way. The yoke 
grew lighter as he went from nain 
to nain. Presently he stood before 
his father. Ariitat looked at him a 
moment with a dull gaze. His eyes 
were filmy. Then they saw the boy. 
A faint smile rested briefly on his 
haggard face. Suddenly the boy 
cried out, “I am sorry! I am sorry. 
Father, that I ever took away the 
bearskin!” 

The yoke was lifted, the buckets 
put down. “I had set all things to 
that end,” his father said. “As for 
all this — it be our weird. Ah, wa- 
ter. Good.” He took the horn and 
dipped it full and raised his head as 
he raised the horn to his mouth and 
his eyes settled on something 
beyond. For a moment he did not 
move. Then his teeth clicked arid 
rattled on the rim of the horn. Then 
he made sounds in his throat. And 
next he drank. But his eyes never 
moved. 

A guard, perhaps thinking that 
they had been too long over the 
matter, approached — the expres- 
sion on his face was part sneer and 
part fear. He gave a quick look 
over his shoulder and with his head 
motioned to another guard to fol- 
low. This first guard set his fea- 
tures for stern speech and gave the 
hand which held the club a shake or 
two. But what he was about to say 
went unsaid, as from above and 

IF 




beyond a voice whose syllables the 
boy could not make out came 
floating on the air and echoed twice 
or more. The guard’s face twisted 
in his own effort to comprehend, 
then showed surprise — regret — re- 
lief. The guard turned away, 
turned back, spoke to the guard 
behind. And this one gave a quick 
look at the captive father and son, 
a quick look up and beyond. He 
shrugged. The two king’s men 
moved apart and drew themselves 
up in a stance of bravado and 
watchfulness. 

Arntat let out a long breath. One 
hand groped for his son. The other 
then hung the horn-thong around 
the boy’s neck. A drop of water 
trickled from it, made a muddy 
wormtrack through the dust on his 
chest. Both hands found the yoke 
and lifted it as the boy bent to 
receive it. Both hands turned the 
boy around and told him, plain as 
words, to be on his way. Arnten 
went. He went several steps. He 
heard behind him the grunt and the 
thud as, rest over, toil returned to, 
the mattock struck the red-ore 
ground. Then he stopped and 
looked up, whither his father had 
looked, up to where the guards had 
looked. Nothing was there. His 
eyes, darting about, saw again the 
group of guards. They had just 
begun crossing over the rim and, as 
one by one they stepped out of 
sight, he saw once more the 
unarmed person among them, who 
paused upon the edge between 
earth and sky. Pausing for a 
moment and looking back, this 
person for an instant seemed to 
have raised wings poised for flight. 

Wide-cut sleeves. A woman. 



She vanished over the rim. 

A blow caught him in the ribs, a 
rock fell and bounced. He dodged 
the second. It came from the guard 
who had desisted from striking him 
and his father before. But he had to 
move and turn his back and yet 
balance the yoke and the buckets, 
so he could not run. The third stone 
caught him. And so did the fourth. 



W HEN the thralls lay down 
their mattocks and began to 
load the broken ore into the bar- 
rows the first captain looked, say- 
ing nothing. Afterward he gestured 
to Arnten and Arntat. “You two — 
or you one and half — ’’ the guards 
guffawed — “Take the tools to the 
tunnel. The rest of you to the 
forge.’’ Two by two, the nains 
stooped and took up the barrow 
poles. Low at first like a mutter, 
then a rumble, as though the voices 
had descended from mouth to 
throat and chest; then so very high 
it seemed almost that they sang not 
at all as they padded along the 
curving path — and then cry after 
cry, as great wave after great wave 
breaking upon the rocks — 

The swans fly overhead 
A nd the nains see them. 

The moles tunnel through, 
the earth 

A nd the nains see them. 

The guards could not ken the 
words, but the sound of the chant 
made them uneasy. They howled 
and mocked, they threw stones, 
small ones but vicious and thrown 
hard.

The king's fire gives no light. 

The queen's light gives no fire. 
Evil, evil, are these times. 

These carrion times, consumed 
by crows. 

When will the wizard's mouths 
be fed, 

A nd the nains see it? 

The tools were gathered and 
bundled together like great 
faggots of firewood. Father and 
son bowed their backs beneath 
their loads and turned their faces 
toward the tunnel. It was not the 
load that made Arntat tremble 
now, nor was it his last labor of the 
day that made him sweat and gasp. 
Unwilling, unwilling, slow, were 
his steps and he craned his neck at 
the darkening sky as though he 
would never see it againr 
Beyond them the guards seemed 
to have been taken by a frenzy, 
stoning the nains and shouting and 
feinting at them with clubs and 
spears. But above all such noise the 
wild chant continued to be heard. 

The king's evil rots like rust, 

A nd the nains see it. 

When will the stars throw down 
their spears,

Then may this kingdom turn

trudged back and forth in the 
tunnel, head stooped low — perhaps 
for safety, perhaps from apathy — 
hands against the sides as though at 
any moment he might push one or 
another of them aside. Sometimes 
he shambled on all his limbs, head 

108 



weaving from side to side. But he^ 
was sitting motionless when the dry 
bracken rustled as it sometimes 
did, as though remembering when 
it was alive and yielding to each 
slight breeze. And a woman came 
in. She first saw the smaller Arn, 
and for just a moment the smooth 
composure of her face was 
disturbed — how curious, then, her 
expression! He moved at once to 
his father’s side and her face was as 
before. In a single motion, ef- 
fortless, graceful, she seated her- 
self, her legs tucked under, her 
hands resting in her lap. Son 
looked at father and he thought his 
father looked as though he had 
always been looking at her. 

“Yet another son gotten, Ahaz- 
mazra,’’ she said. “And so much 
younger than the others.” She 
made a slight sound as if pleasant- 
ly relaxing from some not too on- 
erous task and she said, “You will 
want to know about your other 
sons.” 

Lips barely moving, he said, “Ei- 
ther they died or they made their 
peace. I can do them no good. Nor 
they me.” 

Calmly: “You may do good for 
this one then,” she said. 

This one, crouching next to his 
father, was not much thinking how 
good could be done for him. Part of 
his mind was entranced by the 
appearance of her. Part of his mind 
scurried and searched, as a squirrel 
rousting nuts, for certain words his 
father had said — when? Long, long 
ago. When they were free. 

'Tis nought to you what's my~ 
name-then. But now he knew, his 
fullfather’s name then was Ahaz- 
mazra and if this woman knew it 



IF 




she had known him then. Her un- 
derdress, beneath which her feet 
were tucked, was all of blue. He 
had never seen so much cloth of 
blue before, blue was a precious 
color, a sky-color, and he had 
heard more than one say that far- 
far-away at the farthermost edge of 
the world dwelt the Sky Gatherers 
and that all the blue in the world 
came from them, scarce, scarce,/ 
precious and beautiful blue: but his 
old uncle had said this was in no 
way true and that blue was made 
from an herb called woad; it did 
not flourish in Thule, was brought 
from the barbar-lands and traded 
for amber, weight for weight. 

Ahaz-mazra, And not Arn. 

My other begotten sons . 
made upon empty bearhide in law- 
ful bedchamber. Her sleeveless 
overdress was the whitest white 
which he had ever seen, paler than 
the common pallor of bark-cloth, 
and came to her knees. Round 
yoke and hem were broad and 
complex broider-work in several 
colors, flowers and leaves and 
thicket — something else which he 
could not quite determine and 
which peered out of the thicket. 
Around her neck was a rope of 
pieces of amber wrapped in golden 
wire. Her face was strong, serious, 
totally self-assured. Although she 
had come from the free, the out- 
side world, she had come neither 
to triumph nor to condescend. I 
have dabbled. Why was that word 
in his mind? . have dabbled , , , 
Or should it be dappled? That 
made no sense. Yet the memory 
that went with the words was of 
his father's face dappled by a leaf 
shadows as he held for a passing 

ARNTENOF ULTIMA THULE 



moment a branch he presently 
threw upon the fire. I have — 

‘‘I have done ill enough for him 
by getting him," said his father 
(now) to the strange woman. Who 
said a strange, strange thing in- 
deed. 

"You may get him back with 
you whither you both came — on a 
ship already prepared in all things 
— at dawn tide three days hence," 
she said. "You have only to re- 
nounce the curse on iron and to 
swear by your shadow and by his 
that it shall stay renounced. And 
you may even delay compliance to 
the last— when the third day's sun 
comes up and shadows first appear 
— upon the very shore beside the 
ship." 

The sick, confused look, which 
had been absent since her entrance, 
now* returned to the man's face. He 
muttered, uncertainly. "The third 
day's sun?" 

"It is three days' journey to 
where the boats are." 

He squinted, trying to resolve all 
into sense. Then he in one swift 
rush was on his feet and Arnten 
cried out and put his hands on his 
own head as though feeling the 
pain of his father's would crash 
upon the tunnel top. But that one 
or two fingers' breadth away the 
man's head stayed, stooped. The 
woman had not moved. She did not 
even raise her eyes. And the man 
fell to a charging position, his eyes 
level with hers, his face very close 
to hers, his eyes now suffused with 
blood. 

"Innahat — erex," he cried, "ah, 
eh! Does that crow still live, that he 
has stolen all the wits of thee? 
‘Wither we both came?’ ‘By ship?' 

109 




‘Renounce the curse on iron?’ 
What babblement is this? From 
nowhere did we come by ship! No 
word of any curse on iron heard I 
ever till my cub here did mention it, 
before we fell into the nets of your 
long-tongued lord! ‘Sear by my 
shadow and by his?’ Eh, ah! By my 
shadow and by his, then — ” 

M ore than once, after having 
returned in from out, Arnten 
had felt sickened and dizzied. The 
sun might have been the cause, 
beating as it did on him ail day. 
Such a moment came upon him 
suddenly as he wondered what 
great oath his father was about to 
swear upon their twain shadows. 
He closed his eyes. He did not hear 
if the oath were sworn. He did hear 
the distant droning of the nains as 
they returned, as their voices rose 
suddenly and dropped again. The 
strange woman was now gone, he 
saw. He saw his father’s eyes were 
fixed on his and ail manner of 
strange things he saw in them. 

“Eh, ah. Bear! What odd thing 
we seed by yonder tunnel-mouth 
but two, or three! How ’t did leap! 
A hare! Was ’t an omen, eh?’’ 

“I ken’t not, if omen ’tiz,’’ an- 
other nain said. “But ’twas as thee 
say, senior Aar-heved-heved-aar, a 
great puss-longears indeed, and 
would I’d a snare to catch she doe- 
hare, do she return — eh? — cub?’’ 
For this other nain looked now 
at Arnten, who had stood up, al- 
though still dizzied, waving his 
hand, trying frantically to put a 
thought into words before the 
thought fled. “The hare came in!’’ 
he said, almost stammering. “The 
hare came in! What way she came 
in, would she not go out?’’ 

no 



The man put an arm around his 
son. The comforting nain-drone 
and nain musk surrounded them. 
The boy’s head drooped upon his 
father’s side. He felt weak and sore 
and hungry. Food would come. 
Words sang in his head and faint 
fires danced there. Bee and sal- 
mon, wolf and bear. A rough hand 
rested gently on him. Tiger, lion, 
mole and hare. 

Fetters do not bind the moles. 

A nd the nains see them. 



VIII 

A AR-heved-heved-aar that 

night sent a youngster hain to 
search out the passage where the 
hare had run. Guards did not trust 
the lower levels at night, would not 
even if the nains were gone. Posts 
and watch fires were at pit mouth 
only. Even wind and rain could not 
drive the guards more than a few 
feet inside after full dark. The 
nain-senior knew this, but did not 
trust the slickskins as cowards any 
more than he trusted them as 
braves; he chose to lessen all risks. 
It was not true that nains had full 
vision in the dark, but in this wise 
their eyes were in between those of 
men and those of beasts. The 
younger nain reported that 
although the tunnel appeared to be 
a blind gut, yet it did not end clean. 
A huge pile of debris at one end 
seemed to show that it might not 
always have been a blind gut — that 
perhaps the roof had fallen in at 
one time. And, more than this, the 
younger'nain had sought and found 
the scent of the hare and it had 
seemed to go on up the pile of 
detritus to its peak. ' 




“But I clambered not after it,” 
he concluded. 

“Wisely,” said the senior. “For 
though I be as much a-zeal as any 
to be gone from here, needless risks 
we must not take. It is man who is 
impetuous, but we nains do be 
deliberate, so — ” 

“Feed the wizards.” 
Aar-heved-heved-aar, true to his 
penultimate word, reflected. Then, 
“Eh, ah. Bear. Say thee well.” 

“Feedf the wizardsr 
The nain-senior looked up at the 
man — for all his breadth, the-nain 
was no taller than Arnten — and 
nodded his massive head. “That 
must be our aim, hard task though 
it be. It is the coming death of iron 
which has turned this king's head 
mad and turned his hands against 
us all. His need be great. But is our 
need not greater? If he do die 
tonight and tomorrow we be told 
that we be free, what then? Iron be 
our life, without iron we be dead 
nains. ’Tiz but the first step, get- 
ting gone from here. He will pur- 
sue we, but if he should not, what, 
eh? We do make the hoe, but we 
hoe not; we have traded iron and 
iron’s work for most our food. We 
make the spearhead, but we cast no 
spear. And if we will to eat in the 
woods, as the wild brawnes 
do — say, ah! — be not the wild 
brawnes a fitter match for us, be we 
not armed with iron?” 

He uttered a long, shuddering 
cry and his head shook so from side 
to side that his thick hair rustled 
upon his broad and shaggy 
shoulders. “Men gender much,” he 
said, “and the men-wives bear 
often. Nains gender seldom for our 
passion be for the forge and few are 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



the nain-bairns our shes do get. 
Before the Great Bear took starfire 
and gave it we and beteached we 
how to delve and deliver metal 
from the earth’s belly and to mold 
and shape it as the bears do mold 
and shape their cubs— before even 
the yore-tide — ^^men were few and 
nains were few and lived they twain 
folk far apart, for broad and long 
be Thule. 

“But since then men have 
swarmed — yet the nain’s numbers 
do stay the same. Still be Nain- 
land far from menland, eh but ah, 
it be not so far as once "twos! Men 
can hunt without iron, men can 
farm without iron, men can still 
beget them many mennikins with- 
out iron; men can do without iron 
and I betell thee this: If men may 
live without iron, men may live 
without nains. 

The echo of his voice was long in 
his listeners’ minds. 

He divided them into nine 
watches and to each watch he as- 
signed a third part of one night. 
And the first watch for the first 
third of the first night began at 
once to clear away with slow care 
the rubble at the end of what they 
had begun to call The Doe-Hare’s 
Den. The nains stripped off their 
leather kilts and piled loose stone 
therein, then gathered up the cor- 
ners four and slung the juried bags 
over their shoulders and trudged 
away on noiseless feet to empty 
their loads well out of sight in yet 
another disused corridor. And then 
to return. Thus, while the work 
went on, none lost more rest than 
one-third of every third night; and, 
after many nights, the toilers in the 
Doe-Hare’s Den, pausing a 



111 




moment for rest, recognized in 
their nostrils the bitter, faint, fa- 
miliar smell of woodsmoke — and 
recognized that an aperture, of 
whatsoever a nature, existed be- 
tween them in their captivity and 
the unfettered outside world. 

AND thus the elusive memory 
returned to the boy. Remem- 
bering woodsmoke and firelight 
and father’s words, he said, “The 
strange woman who was here. Was 
she the queen of love with whom 
you dabbled and dallied?’’ 

A silence. “Eh, she was.’’ 

“Be that why the king do hate 
thee?’’ 

A growl. “She said he never 
knew.’’ 

“Then why do he hate thee?’’ 

A grunt. “Has thee'^fofgot my 
tale of how he and me vowed a 
compact and at the end stood face 
to face to fight for treasure and for 
life, winner take all?’’ 

“No, I remember that.’’ 

A cough.' A second, longer, deep- 
er cough. 

A gasp. “I won. He lay at my 
feet. He groveled and gibbered. I 
raised him up, gave him half the 
plunder and I spared his life. That 
is why. For this he cannot forgive 
me. 

I N THE darkness he heard dron- 
ing of dry and dusty voices and 
he knew it was the wizards that he 
heard. He heard them droning as 
though ineffably bored and weary, 
as though repeating over and over 
to themselves, lest they forget, 
forcing their dust-choked voices 
and thinking with dust-choked 
minds, at a great distance away. 



repeating something of great im- 
portance which must not be for- 
gotten — The bear dies, iron dies. 
The bear dies, iron dies. As the 
bear comes to life, so must iron 
come to life. As the bear comes to 
life, so must iron come to life. A 
pause, a faint gasp, the click of 
voices in dry, dusty throats. And 
again and again the droning re- 
commenced. The bear sleeps in the 
ground, so must iron sleep in the 
ground. As the bear sleeps its 
death-sleep-life, so must iron . 

The bear dies, iron dies . 

Endlessly he heard this. The 
sound ebbed and fadded away as he 
felt himself gently rocked. 

^^Whatr 

“Bear’s boy, it be time.’’ 

Time for iron, time for . But 
the droning voices were away and 
gone. Had he heard them echoing 
thinly in a cavern somewhere? Or 
was it only the familiar echo of the 
nain voices in the mine? Confused, 
already forgetting, he got up. 

Still half asleep he followed, 
sometimes stumbling, as the men 
filed from their sleeping-cell into 
unguarded tunnels. In the Doe- 
Hare’s Hole he saw the now famil- 
iar sight of and heard the now fa- 
miliar sounds of debris and detri- 
tus being shoveled and scraped into 
the carrying-skins. But while this 
still went on he heard those who 
watched and who waited discussing 
whither they should go when they 
had made their escape from the 
mines: and should they go in one 
body for defense, or should they 
split up and make their several — or 
it might be their many — ways, in 
order to divide and so to weaken 
their pursuers.

IF 




He did not hear if an answer had 
been concluded, let alone what it 
was, for Aar-heved-heved-aar took 
hold of him and said, “Bear’s-boy, 
’tis thought they have broke 
through up ahead. Get thee up 
then, for thee be but small as be 
compare to us and maybe can find 
out — ” 

The senior nain did not finish his 
phrase, but propelled Arnten for- 
ward, saying, “Up, then, and up 
and up.” 

Though so much diminished, 
still the pile was high and required 
qlimbing. He half scuttled and he 
half slid as he set to climbing. And 
he had somehow a fear that, 
though he went on his way slow 
enough, still, he might strike his 
head there in the darkness; and 
from this fear he went slower. And 
every few paces he paused and 
thrust his hands forward. 

And by and by he felt his hand as 
it scraped the face of the cavern 
suddenly fall through into nothing- 
ness, and he fell forward a bit and 
he grunted rather than cried out. 
And ahead of him, where yet he 
could not see, ahead of him in the 
black, black, blackness, something 
moved which was even blacker 
(though how he knew this he did 
not know). Something made a sud- 
den movement and a sudden noise 
and he had the impression that 
something had been waiting and 
hearkening, listening very closely, 
he had an impression of a head 
cocked to one side — 

And before he himself could do 
more, the sound from the other 
side of the hole ceased to be start- 
led, flurried, resolved itself into the 
flap of wings in the darkness. 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



And he and all of them heard the 
sudden sharp cry of a crow. And 
again, farther away. And once 
more, faint. 

N OW the work quickened, con- 
centrated and focused on en- 
larging the opening. An opening 
onto the world at large? Or into 
another cave? If the latter, still, this 
next cave must itself open onto the 
world at large, else how came any 
bird to be there? But the stone or 
bone blades of their picks no longer 
sank, into rubble. Either they 
sprang back as they were swung 
against the lips of the scrape-hole 
or they shattered. The nains began 
to mutter. Then Arn came forward 
on all fours, reached out his long, 
shaggy arms, felt and pawed and 
groped in the darkness. 

“It seems that two slabs of rock 
all but meet face to face here,” he 
said. “Some bit of softer stone did 
rest between them, as might a piece 
of stale bread between a dead 
man’s teeth — 

“Now, part of that had weath- 
ered away, else that hare had nei- 
ther entered nor left— and we have 
battered away the rest — but the 
teeth be fixed firm. Somehow we 
must crack the jawbones, then. 
So—” 

His voice fell into a muttering 
growl. 

“We must break the jaws of the 
rock,” he said once more. “How?” 
he muttered. “How? How?"" 

A DULL glow from a brazier 
. of coals made shadows as the 
king moved slowly and painfully 
upon his bed. Something scuttled 
outside the chamber. Someone en- 



113 




tered on hands and knees. The king 
lifted his head, stopped, groaned, 
rubbed his face, moaned. 

“You smell of mold and of 
.trees,” he whispered. “Well — 
what?” 

Merred-delphin panted a mo- 
ment. Then: “Slayer of—” 

The king made a noise of loath- 
ing, deep in his throat. 

“Damn all fulsome phrases! 
None’s here now save thee and me. 
Whatr 

“Wolf— the mine-thralls — try- 
ing to break — ” His wind failed, 
his voice caught in his scrannel 
chest and throat. 

His master finished the words. 
“To break out? Eh? To—” He 
struggled up, hissed his pain, rested 
on his elbows. Raised his voice. 
“Woy.'” he cried. “The captain of 
the guard! Hoy! Hoy! Hither! 
Flay him, does he slumber? Hith- 
er! Here! Now! Hoyr 



T he bear half-slid, half-crawled 
backward. The air in the hole 
was thick. “Bring bracken,” he 
said. “Bring all the bracken that 
be. Not all of ye!” he called sharp- 
ly. “The crew of the first 
third — ^go!” What might have been 
confusion was at once averted. 
“The crew of the second third — to 
that line of tunnel where the pit 
props be fallen and bring, for the 
first fetch, the smallest and the 
softest pieces of the dry-rotted old 
props — ” 

He waited till they had got them 
gone and next he said, “Senior 
Aar. We must needs soon make 
fire.” 

A moment, then the elder nain 

114 



murmured, “Ah, bear, that be no 
easy thing, thee knows.” 

“I do know!” 

“They take care — and always 
have — the accursed smoothskins, 
that we have no flint about us — to 
name but one lack — and though we 
might break the pick-handles, their 
wood be not — ” 

“And this, all this, I know. And 
th^e knows and all of ye know what 
1 mean. Well. The cub and I will 
withdraw.” 

Softly, as it might have been re- 
luctantly, the senior nain said, 
“Nay the twain of ye may bide. 
‘Tis no time to stand upon cus- 
tom.” 

He made a sign to the remain- 
ing nains and, though somewhat 
slowly, they joined hands. There 
was scarce room even at the broad- 
er end of the Doe-Hare’s cave for a 
wide circle, shoulder to broad 
shoulder they stood, hand in hand, 
leg against leg and foot against 
foot. All was silent and, as silence 
will when thought upon, silence 
gradually gave voice. Silence 
whispered to itself, and silence 
began to sing a little song. It was a 
curious bit of song and it hissed 
and it crackled as the nain feet 
shuffled, as the nain forms shifted 
themselves in the darkness, as the 
small and cramped circle went 
around and around in the dark- 
ness, softly stamping feet upon 
the rubble-strewn floor. 

Arnten stared into the blackness 
and, as it will when stared long in- 
to, the blackness began to give 
light, a faint blue light, a spark, a 
worm, a glow that had no outline 
and faded. And then did not fade. 

Arnten felt the hairs on his flesh 



IF 




rise as his skin puckered in some* 
thing the far side of fear. He saw in 
the darkness the forms of the nains 
and he saw their hairs risen and he 
saw upon that nimbus of hair 
outlining each head and each body 
a nimbus of blue light: and as the 
nains so softly-softly muttered the 
lights wavered and as the nains 
slowly circled around the blue 
lights slowly undulated and as the 
nains slowly and softly stamped 
their feet the blue lights softly 
hissed and softly crackled. 

The dance did not cease when 
the first crew returned, arms laden 
with the great coarse bracken-fern; 
Arnten gestured and they passed 
their burdens, bundle by bundle, to 
the end of the cave. First they 
stuffed it through the still small 
opening into the outside world 
and then, when this would take no 
more, piled it all around about. 

Then the second crew began to 
come back, stripped to the buff, 
their garment-skins used as carry- 
alls for piles of wood from the fall- 
en pit-props, soft from long dry 
rot, and Arnten gestured again and 
they piled wood on the bracken. 
And still the slow, strange dance 
went on and on. Arn, in a few 
words, bade two more crews be- 
gone. They must bring back the 
larger stumps and shafts of the 
wooden columns used here and 
there to hold up the tunnel roof. 

The dancing nains, meanwhile, 
had danced nearer and closer to 
what was now a bosky mass of dry- 
rotted wood and bracken. The 
dancing nains were pressed togeth- 
er almost as though to make one 
enormous grotesque creature with 
many limbs, a sort of nainipede; 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



and this grotesque heaved and hud- 
dled close to the spiled up bracken- 
fern which had been its bed. Still it 
sang and still the blue lights wav- 
ered at the ends of its hairs; and 
then the blue light gathered itself 
together into one mass and the 
nainipede went dancing back on its 
many limbs. The ball of light 
floated up and bounced along the 
rough roof of the cave and settled 
upon the pile of wood. It seemed 
next to snuggle and to creep its way 
deep into the bracken and then 
there was a Hash and the blue was 
gone and there was the familiar red 
and orange and yellow of fire. And 
the song was silent but in its place 
they heard the crackling of flames. 

M ERRED-DELPHIN stood 
by the curtained door and 
flapped wide black sleeves. 

“My men have them safe now?” 
the Orfas demanded. 

His chief witcherer opened his 
mouth and closed it, long thin 
tongue fluttering. Then he said, 
“They will not go.” 

Then seemed the King confused. 
“How now? Woii’t go? The 
nains?” 

Merred shook his dry old head, 
his long nose seeming to point all 
ways at once. “Not the nains. King 
Wolf! The men! Your men! The 
king’s men will not go! They will 
not go down into the mine! It 
seems — I should have remembered 
that — ” His voice stuck, came out 
again at last. “They fear the deep, 
they fear the darkness, assuredly 
they fear the nains and their 
witchery.” 

The old wolf let waste no time in 
rage and imprecation, but he 

115 




rubbed one rusty wrist with one 
rusty hand and he said in the voice 
of one who thinks, “Then what is it 
which they may fear e’en more, my 
crow, than the nains and the deep 
and dark — eh?’’ 

They looked at each other. The 
king’s eyes went past the old vizier 
and the old vizier turned; and to- 
gether they exclaimed a word. 

S O DRY was bracken and dry- 
rotted wood that both together 
burned with minimal smoke, but 
smoke even so there was. Arn and 
Arnten and the nains stood in the 
main corridor and with their gar- 
ment-skins they flapped and 
fanned away the smoke. And now 
and then they stopped and took 
sips of water from the buckets, but 
only sips. A thin glow of firelight lit 
the somber halls of underground 
and over this overlay a thin haze of 
smoke. The fire dance of the nain- 
folk had ceased. 

He leaned against his father and 
in his body he was in the mine-cave 
and beside his father, yet in his 
mind he was beside his old uncle in 
the old man’s medicine hut. And 
there was the sound of a dance . 
the sound of a drum . 

Out of the dimness and the deep, 
deep darkness came the figures of 
men. It was no vision or 
dream — here, in the mine and out 
of the darkness of the mine-tun- 
nels, they came. 

“The guards,’’ said Aar. “Aye, 
ehh’ng, be sure, be sure, ’twas that 
skulk-crow as sped the word to 
their crank lord.’’ And in the nain- 
tongue he said a word. The men 
came not fast ahead, they moved 
slowly, irresolute. And in the dim 

116 



glow of the fire and the thin haze of 
the smoke the nains began another 
sort of dance. They moved their 
feet up and down and they leaned 
forward and they waved their long, 
long arms. They did not actually 
move an ell along the tunnel floor, 
but in the misty, swimmy light, 
dim and flickering, it seemed as 
though they did move, did advance; 
and the men, moaning, dismayed, 
retreated. 

Then at the edge of his ear Arn- 
ten heard the sound which had 
tapped below the surface, the thin 
tap-tap, tump-tump, of a witchery 
drum. And the soldiers milled 
about, cried out in alarm and un- 
ease. A spurt of fresh air cleared 
vision for a moment and a way 
ahead and now it was Arnten who 
cried out and a murmur went up. 
For back, far back, as far back as 
they could see in the main corridor 
came a marching column, a march- 
ing double column, a dancing 
double column, of figures which 
were manlike but were no men, a- 
waving in their tiny hands the 
menace of tiny spears. 

And the witch-drum beat and the 
witch-things came and the men 
cried out and turned and turned. 

Said one nain voice, amused and 
scorning, “Do they come at us with 
mandrakes, then? Nay’ng! The 
children o’ the forge know a power 
or two for that.” 

Swiftly said the elder Aar, “ ’Tis 
not against us that they deploy the 
mandrakes, ’tis to force on the 
men o’the king, who know no pow- 
er, let alone two, for that.’’ 

Arn, without one word, picked 
up one of the water buckets and 
went straightway into the smoke- 

IF 




filled hole of the hare, pausing a 
moment at the entrance to pick up 
a fallen bit of bracken and dip it in 
the water and crush the dripping 
frond against his nose and mouth. 

In a moment came a hissing sound 
and a cloud of steam rolled out and 
all firelight was quenched. 

But not for long, for torches now 
made appearances farther down 
the main corridor. The men, 
fearing the mandrakes more than 
the nains, came closer. 

Arn emerged, stumbling, seized 
another bucket and again entered 
the cave. Again there was a hissing 
and a sizzling and again a cloud of 
steam. And a long pause — and 
Arnten held his breath and feared. 
And then the bear emerged again. 

“The fire be out,” he said, low 
and urgent. “And now it comes 
time to take these two last buckets 
of water and toss them on the hot 
rock. Do they crack well, we may 
all yet take our leave. And if 
not — ” He shrugged. A huge mass 
of smoldering bracken was 
dragged out, picked up, heaved to- 
ward the advancing soldiery — who 
cried out, fell back into the smoke 
and gloom. And the drums beat 
and the mandrakes moved. 

Now, all at once, all were in the 
place whence the hare had fled. 
Somehow there was light, light of a 
thin gray sort, obscured by steam, 
by smoke, but light. And Arnten 
felt the floor hot, hot against his 
feet and hissed his pain. He saw his 
father toss one bucket, heard him 
toss the second. Heard a cracking 
sound. And a second. Heard the 
nains give cry to their satisfac- 
tion. Heard the almost desperate 
cries of the king’s men as they 

ARNTEN OF ULTIMA THULE 



charged. Heard the sound of spears 
striking against wall and floor. 
Heard the sound of spear striking 
against flesh. Heard his voice 
raised in a wail as he saw his fa- 
ther stumble upon one knee with 
one spear into him. Saw Aar- 
heved-heved-aar fall and saw him 
crawl and saw him writhe and 
heard his death rattle. 

Saw the bear seizing the very 
rims of the hole of the rock and 
smelled his flesh burn and saw his 
shoulders writhe and saw the rock 
face crack still more. Cried out and 
wailed again as he saw his father 
turn toward him, face grim and 
hideous and smudged with ash and 
soot and blood spurting from nose 
and mouth. Saw that protruding 
from his father’s flesh which he 
knew was the bloodied head of a 
spear. Felt his father seize him up 
and swing him around and protect 
his smaller body and thrust him 
through the hole in the rock 
whence came the milky light of 
dawn. Felt the last great thrust of 
that great body and saw the mine 
vanish from sight and felt the hot 
rock graze his side and saw the sky 
and felt himself fall. And roll. And 
move, crawling, crawling. Leaves 
in his mouth, dust in his nostrils, 
smoke all about him. Then no 
smoke about him. Writhing on his 
belly like a wounded snake. No 
more smoke. Shouts and cries in 
his mind alone. Then silence fall- 
ing in his mind. 

His father. 

His father’s face. 

His father’s deed. 

At this last moment his father 
had said no word. 

His deed had been enough. •

T here is a theory that our 
progress must be represented 
by an asymptotic curve; that is, the 
higher we climb, the steeper the 
rate of change. If the predictions 
I’ve seen are even reasonably 
close, there will be far more change 
in conditions and in what we call 
our body of fact in the next thirty 
years than in the last hundred. 

This makes it difficult for 
science fiction to predict the future 
with even a crude approximation 
of what will happen by the year 
2000. In fact, writers in search of a 
reputation for prophecy can’t be 
sure whether to produce wish- 
dreams of glory or nightmares of 
man’s ultimate doom. Most of 
the dooms pictured a century ago 



turned out to be nonsense, as did 
the utopias. And while we seem to 
be living at a time of ill omens, 
those who seek the easy answer by 
predicting horrible futures are 
no closer to probability than the 
most optimistic. 

But nobody with any serious 
right to be heard ever claimed that 
science fiction was primarily 
prophecy. At best it is merely an 
attempt to. create a consistent, 
reasonably rational background 
picture of what a future might be 
like. The science in our science fic- 
tion doesn’t really relate to the 
hard body of physical facts that 
might be used by an engineer, 
though we try not to violate such 
facts unwittingly. Instead, we 



118 




try to use some of the techniques 
of the supposedly impractical, 
“pure” scientist; we look over the 
known facts to find what isn’t fully 
known; we devise theories, care- 
fully weeding out what is incon- 
sistent or already disproved; and 
finally we test our theories to see 
whether they work. Of course, we 
test them only as fiction, with the 
proof being the workability of our 
future world as a place where our 
story characters can function as 
more than shadows. 

Unfortunately, much of the ma- 
terial now being written doesn’t op- 
erate that way. A great deal of it 
cops out by taking something that 
is currently in the news and acting 
as if it would be even more so a 
hundred years from now. Other 
current writing, all too often, bor- 
rows from past vision without 
adding current vision. 

As a result, I find it difficult to 
locate material that has any real 
insight, either visionary or night- 
marish, except for the fortunate 
reprinting of stories done a decade 
or three ago. 

However, there is now a series 
of books which should be read by 
everyone who enjoys good fiction 
re the future. These are reprints, 
long unavailable except in rather 
expensive hard-to-find editions. 

They are the so-called juvenile 
books of Robert A. Heinlein, cur- 
rently being issued in soft covers by 
Ace, at a price of 95^ each. Many 
of them are the top examples of 



what good science fiction should 
be. They represent the work of one 
of our best writers at the very peak 
of his form. 

Don’t let the term “juvenile” 
fool you. The stories are partially 
told from the viewpoint of 
characters who haven’t reached 
legal maturity yet; but so was van 
Vogt’s Slan^ and nobody 
considered that a juvenile story. 
The outlook, the writing, the phil- 
osophy and the complexity of the 
Heinlein pieces are completely 
adult. 

Above all, they present a highly 
structured, thoroughly imagined 
and consistent picture of a future 
for each novel. On the average, 
nobody has done as good a job of 
making futures real as Heinlein, 
and these books are among his best 
in that respect. 

Between Planets is most certain- 
ly not a picture of the future, ac- 
cording to what we now know sci- 
entifically about Venus. This was 
written twenty years ago, before 
radio astronomy and the Venus 
probes. It uses a picture of Venus 
that is hopeless, in the light of 
later discoveries. Here the planet 
is the old-fashioned water- 
drenched world, covered with deep 
fogs and mists, with some islands 
sticking up from the great shallow 
seas. As hard prophecy, it fails 
miserably. 

But that doesn’t matter too 
much. The water-world is com- 
plete, livable and lived in, with 



READING ROOM 



119 




technologies and attitudes that fit 
it. It has its own intelligent race 
and a bunch of alien creatures that 
are completely delightful. And it is 
one of the better stories of an at- 
tempt by a colony world to break 
from the strictures of Earth in a 
sort of interplanetary war — one 
logically worked out for its space 
“battles” and its eroding, desul- 
tory home battles. 

T his was fairly early in Hein- 
tein’s work in the juveniles. The 
protagonist is quite acceptable to 
any adult reader — and he most def- 
initely doesn’t stay a juvenile — but 
some of the mechanics of the so- 
lution creak a bit. Still, Between 
Planets stands up todayl>etter than 
many current adult books, and 
there is no writing down in it. 
When it first appeared, it was 
good enough to be used as a serial 
by one of the most adult of the ad- 
venture magazines, at a time 
when science fiction had to be 
better than most other material 
to win acceptance. 

Red Planet, in a way, lets down a 
bit. Again there is the completely 
believable development of rebel- 
lion, this time by the colonists on 
Mars against the Earth-based 
Company and its corrupt local 
representatives. Again, local fauna 
and flora are worked out so well 
that the book is justified by its 
aliens alone. But much of this 
seems somehow more standard in 
its development than the Venus 



book. The science is not as far 
from current theories — Mars 

was better known than Venus — 
but it fails in indicating too rich a 
supply of oxygen on Mars. 

But when we get to The Rolling 
Stones, all the early slight com- 
promises Heinlein made to the age 
of his readers is discarded. This 
must be a delight to young readers, 
but it’s twice as much fun for those 
who are adult. The main viewpoint 
characters here are a couple of 
teen-age twins. But the whole 
Stone family — mentioned in the 
later adult Moon Is a Harsh Mis- 
tress — is the real “hero” of the 
story. 

Unlike most of the series. Stones 
is one of Heinlein’s fairly rare 
stories with a completely hu- 
morous slant. The humor doesn’t 
impede the plot, which is a bit 
free-wheeling but still excellent. 

My own favorite is Star Beast. 
Given a period of interstellar ex- 
ploration, it seems inevitable that 
some odd pets would be brought 
back to Earth. But suppose one of 
those pets, a hundred-odd years 
later, turned out to be a ranking 
member of one of the most im- 
portant, sapient and rambunc- 
tious races in the universe? Sup- 
pose it didn’t particularly want 
to return, but the total future of 
interstellar peace depended . on 
finding and returning it? That’s 
just the beginning of the compli- 
cations in this novel. The real hero 
isn’t a youngster, either. He’s the 



120 



IF 




real head of all interstellar 
government on Earth, though 
lacking the title. He’s also aller- 
gic to certain aliens, though he has 
to deal warmly with them. 

This novel also is brightened 
by as unpleasant a mother and as 
precocious a girl friend as can be 
found in science fiction. Heinlein 
uses them, among other things, as 
pointers toward the radical 
changes that have to be made in 
our society and its mores when we 
enter an age of interstellar nego- 
tiations. His concept of a future 
earth is complete not merely sur- 
face treated. His people think dif- 
ferently from us, act differently, 
and have to find different ways of 
making the same instincts and 
methods serve them. If sociology 
and psychology are to be treated 
as sciences in our field, this book 
stands out as one of the better ex- 
amples of how to do so. 

The science of sociology forms 
the background also for Tunnel in 
the Sky. The tunnel here refers to 
a “tube” between dimensions, in 
which it is possible to transfer 
from one world to another. Earth 
has obviously just opened up col- 
onization of various habitable 
worlds discovered by the tunnel. 
And it is undergoing some rather 
radical upsets in its social cus- 
toms. Among these is the need to 
prepare its younger people for the 
unknown hazards they may face 
on other worlds. One method of 
training is a course in survival. 



The graduating class has to pass a 
simple test. It’s members are 
dumped onto a planet— type and 
conditions not specified — and 
left there to take care of them- 
selves for two weeks. They can take 
any equipment with them which 
they can carry — though Heinlein 
indicates what he thinks is the 
best equipment. At the end, those 
who survive are graduated; those 
who fail are simply dead. 

Nice. And probably totally un- 
convincing to most readers of this 
quick summary who cannot be- 
lieve that our attitudes toward 
young men and women could 
change that radically. But his- 
torically, Heinlein is on solid 
ground, and he develops his theme 
so well that it makes total sense in 
the story. 

A local accident makes it impos- 
sible for a student group to use 
their return “tunnel.” The time for 
return comes and goes — and more 
time goes. And those who have sur- 
vived for this long gradually be- 
gin to realize that they jnay never 
be called back. Now, on a world 
about which they still know very 
little, and with only rudimentary 
equipment for a two- week sur- 
vival test, they must set out to build 
a viable way of life for their colony 
and, hopefully, to become a real 
world in time. 

But this is also a story of soci- 
ology, as I said. Heinlein has used

PHILIP JOSi FARMER 




THE FABULOUS 



WHA THAS GONE BEFORE 

One morning the dead of Earth 
awoke with a great cry. 

They were on the banks of a 
river of a planet somewhere in a 
star swarm. They were naked and 
in an interminable valley which 
offered no food — at first. The old 
had been rejuvenated, so that an 
eighty-year-old, for instance, 
again had his twenty-five-year-old 
body. The diseased were healthy: 
the crippled walked straight; the 
misshapen were reshaped. More- 
over, all men had awakened cir- 
cumcised and were permanently 
without facial hair. All women 
were virgins again but forever 
sterile. 

After the horrible fears of hell 

122 



and the shocks of resurrection 
were over, humanity began to look 
around and to construct new so- 
cieties within the physical limita- 
tions of the Rivervalley, their 
psychic conditioning and the 
changed rules of human life. 

The River was usually one to one 
and one-half miles wide, though it 
sometimes became a narrow 
strait or a lake. The only animal 
life consisted of the small earth- 
worm and the fish, which ranged 
from trout- to whale-sized. On 
each side of The River was a gent- 
ly sloping plain a mile wide, then 
two or so miles of hills and then 
perpendicular unscalable moun- 
tains 10,000 feet and more. The 
plains were covered with short 
grasses, the hills with tall grasses. 




RIVERBOAT conclusion 



The other plants were bamboo 
( which is a grass), giant oaks, pine, 
fir, yew and the indestructible 
non-Terrestrial irontrees. Vines 
with huge, varicolored blooms 
grew on the latter. 

The temperature rose to an esti- 
mated 85" F at 2:00 P.M. and fell 
to 60" F around 2:00 A.M. The 
rainfall was unvarying. The esti- 
mated population density was 
260-261 persons per square 
mile— total population was 36 bil- 
lion or so. The River was supposed 
to be from five to ten million miles 
long. It circled this world like a 
Midgard Serpent, issuing from 
the north polar sea and, after much 
twisting across one hemisphere 
and cutting back around the south 
pole, twisted back up the other 

123 



hemisphere and emptied into the 
north polar sea. 

Along each bank of The River, 
at one-mile intervals, and also in 
the hills, were huge mushroom- 
shaped stones. Three times a day 
they discharged enormous elec- 
trical energies derived from some 
place — or mechanism — deep in 
the planet* s guts. Mankind had 
awakened possessing metal cyl- 
inders containing snap-down 
racks and dishes. These cyl- 
inders — the grails — when placed on 
top of the stones, yielded food, 
liquor, tobacco, marihuana ciga- 
rettes and cigars and ** dream- 
gum** after the energy discharge. 
Apparently the grails contained 
devices, inside false bottoms, for 
converting energy to matter. 



Mankind was where he could 
live simply but with no fear of 
freezing or dying of thirst or 
starvation or bacterial or viral 
disease or cancer or almost any of 
the scourges that had made life on 
Earth a hell. 

Sixty percent of mankind had 
been strung along The River in a 
sequence roughly corresponding 
to the chronology of their exis- 
tence on Earth. Thus the earliest 
men (and subhumans } of circa 
2,000,000 B.C. were closest to The 
Riverhead and the latest, born 
circa 1980-2009 A.D., were near 
the mouth. (Mankind had been 
wiped out in 2009 A.D.) Mixed 
with the 60% of a particular time 
and nationality were 30% of a 
minority from another time and 
nationality and 10% apparently 
chosen at random from any time 
and place. But 1% of the total was 
composed of 20th-century hu- 
mans, these being the most nu- 
merous of mankind and the most 
widely scattered. 

Though many people clung to 
the idea that their resurrection 
was of supernatural origin, many 
thought they knew better. It was 
rumored that one man had awak- 
ened in a strange and frightening 
place where the dead were being 
recreated, refleshed and pre- 
pared for their second deaths and 
recreation upon the planet* s sur- 
face through some unknown 
means. This man ( who, said some, 
was Richard Francis Burton, the 
19th-century English explorer, 
linguist, and author) had seen the 
warders of that chamber of the 
dead, who looked just like men. 

During this time, the first twenty 

124 



years after Resurrection Day, 
Samuel Langhorne Clemens — or 
*Mark Twain — had been looking 
for two things. One was his Earth 
wife, Olivia. The other was iron. 
He had two dreams, neither of 
which seemed likely to come true. 

Sam Clemens had met a colossal 
subhuman ( whom he called Joe 
Miller) who told a strange story. 
Joe had managed to get up 
through the mountains surround- 
ing the north pole and had seen a 
tail pale tower in a misty sea and a 
flying machine descending to- 
wards it. Then he had fallen to his 
death and awakened near Clem- 
ens. Sam was fired-up about this; 
he thought that the beings re- 
sponsible for this world must have 
their headquarters in that tower. 
He would build a boat and go all 
the way up The River, if it took 
him a hundred years to do it. 
Then, somehow, he would storm 
the tower and discover the secret 
of resurrection. 

For the trip Sam wanted a great 
river boat such as he had piloted on 
the Mississippi in his youth. Un- 
fortunately the planet seemed to 
have little iron ore. However, he 
met a Norseman, Eric Bloodaxe, 
who had an axe made from a 
nickel-iron meteorite. With Eric*s 
Norsemen and Joe, Sam set out 
down The*River to find a large 
supply of meteorite metal. 

He found it, but not as he had 
planned. A giant meteorite struck 
the valley and the tidal waves al- 
most killed the searchers. But they 
located the iron and began min- 
ing. From the first, to attain his 
boat, Sam had had to make deals 
and compromises he would other- 



IF 




wise have scorned. He had to be- 
come partners with the man who 
had once been King John of En- 
gland, He had to murder Eric 
Bloodaxe, And Eric, before dy- 
ing, had sworn that when Sam did 
get to the end of The River, he 
would find Eric waiting for him, 
and Eric would kill him and thus 
send him off down The River a mil- 
lion or so miles, Sam would never 
get to the misty tower, nor would 
he keep his fabulous River boat, 
Sam was to have nightmares 
thereafter about Eric, 

One night Sam awoke in his hut 
to find a hooded man crouched be- 
side him. This man, whom Sam 
was to call The Mysterious 
Stranger — or X — was one of the 
group that had created this planet 
and the resurrection. Though an 
Ethical (as these beings called 
themselves), he was a renegade. 
He told Sam that he had used his 
powers to deflect the giant meteor- 
ite and to deactivate the repul- 
sive system that would ordinarily 
have sent the falling star past the 
planet. His fellows suspected that 
they had a traitor among them, but 
none of them knew for sure. Sam 
was to build his great boat and take 
a crew upRiver. He would be aid- 
ed by eleven men whom The 
Stranger had chosen to storm the 
tower and wreck the plans of the 
Ethicals. These men would come 
secretly to Clemens and intro- 
duce themselves, 

Sam*s problems as co-consul of 
Parolando, the state formed to 
build the boat, kept him busy day 
and night. One of his problems 
was getting enough wood as fuel 
for the mills and plastic factories. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



And Parolando had to trade 
for — or gain by conquest — ma- 
terials and ores other states had: 
pryolite and bauxite to make 
aluminum, tungsten and iridium 
for electrical components. Add- 
ing to Sam's troubles was the atti- 
tt^e of Olivia, his Earth wife, who 
was no longer in love with him, but 
chose to live with the resurrected 
Frenchman, Cyrano de Bergerac. 

One downRiver state. Soul City, 
was headed by a late 20th-century 
American black militant, El- 
wood Hacking. He had controt of 
certain materials Sam needed 
and was demanding high prices. 
He was also, Sam was sure, plot- 
ting to get hold of the boat after it 
was finished, if not before. Neigh- 
boring states were hoping to do 
the same. King John also was 
making life jumpy for Sam, He 
was bound to be plotting to get the 
boat for himself Meanwhile, 
John's arrogance and lechery had 
to be repressed by Sam. 

Moreover, the missionaries of 
the Church of the Second Chance 
were plaguing him. This religious 
body had formed a few years after 
Resurrection Day. It claimed to 
know what the whole business of 
the River and the Resurrection 
was about. Its members preached 
total pacifism, love for all and a 
striving towards ethical perfec- 
tion. They were also responsible 
for introducing Esperanto as a 
universal language. They wel- 
comed martyrdom as the quick- 
est way for them to travel up and 
down The River and spread their 
religion. 

They were a threat to Clemens 
because they were opposed to the 

125 




building of the boat. Their main 
speaker in this area was Hermann 
Goering, the ex-Nazi, the ex- 
Reichsmarschal. Goering had 
suffered a psychic conversion as 
sudden and as strange and ap- 
parently as sincere as that of Paul 
of Tarsus. 

A large group of fellow mission- 
aries, kicked out of a neighboring 
state, landed in Parolando despite 
orders to stay out. King John, 
eager to try out a new pistol using 
plastic bullets, massacred all but 
a few women. These he took into 
his log palace. Sam could not allow 
John to get away with this, even if 
it meant civil war. So he set out to 
demand the women back, un- 
harmed, and to arrest John: Odys- 
seus was upRiver on a mission. 
Sam had with him Lotthar von 
Richthofen, de Bergerac, Joe 
Miller and a few others. If John re- 
sisted he could cause Sam to 
lose— forever — all hopes of sail- 
ing on his fabulous Riverboat. 

VIII 

S AM saw thirty or so women 
walking out through the open 
gates and knew that John had de- 
cided to rectify his mistake. Even 
so, he could be accused of kidnap- 
ing, a graver crime than murder in 
this topsyturvy world. But if the 
women were unharmed it would be 
too much trouble to push the 
charge. 

He stopped — and this time he 
thought his heart would also stop. 
Gwenafra was with the women! 

Lothar, crying her name, ran to 
her. She ran to him with her arms 
out and they embraced. 

126 



After a minute of hugging, kiss- 
ing and sobbing, she pulled herself 
away and went to. Sam. He could 
not help reproaching hiniself. If he 
had shown that he wanted her, 
when she had made it plain that he 
could have her, she might not have 
turned to von Richthofen. Why 
hadn’t he taken her? Why had he 
clung to the idea that Livy would 
eventually come back and that, if 
he took another woman now, Livy 
would resent it so much she would 
never have anything to do with 
him? She was living with Cyrano. 
So he could do what he pleased. 

His thinking wasn’t logical. He 
sighed. Logic was what one used to 
justify one’s emotions. 

Gwenafra kissed him while her 
tears ran down his bare chest. 
Again she left his arms and went 
back to Lothar, and Sam Clemens 
was left with the problem of what 
i&do with~or to — John Lackland. 

He strode through the gates, Joe 
Miller lumbering behind him. A 
moment later von Richthofen had 
caught up with him. He was swear- 
ing and muttering in German, “I’ll 
kill him!” 

Sam stopped. “You get out of 
here,’’ he said. “I’m mad enough, 
but I can control myself. You’re in 
the lion’s den now — and if you try 
anything he can have you killed and 
claim self-defense. He’d love that. 
In fact, he may have done all this 
just to set up our murder.’’ 

Lothar said, “But you’re here 
with only Joe.’’ 

“1 wouldn’t ever call Joe an 
only,"' Sam replied. “Anyway, if 
you hadn’t been so busy mugging 
with Gwen you would have heard 
me order the troops to storm the 

IF 




palace and kill everybody in it if 
I'm not out in fifteen minutes.” 

Lothar stared at Sam. ‘‘You’ve 
certainly gotten much more agres- 
sive than you used to be.” 

‘‘The more trouble I have and 
the longer the building of the Riv- 
erboat takes, the meaner I get,” 
Sam said. There was no point in 
mentioning that his anger at Lo- 
thar and Gwenafra was turned on- 
to John, who already had so much 
directed at him that he should have 
curled up and crisped away, And 
would have if there were any jus- 
tice in the world. 

He entered the largest building 
inside the stockade of tall lodge- 
pole-pine logs and brushed past 
Sharkey. The slope-shouldered 
thug started to block his way, but 
Sam did not break his stride. 
Sharkey snarled soundlessly and 
made the mistake of not moving 
far enough to one side. A huge red- 
dish-haired hip sent the two-hun- 
dred-and-thirty-pound man stag- 
gering back as if he were a hollow 
dummy. 

‘‘I’ll kill you one of these days,” 
Sharkey said in English. 

Joe turned his head slowly as if 
it were a turret on a battleship and 
the tremendous proboscis were a 
cannon. ‘‘Yeth? You and vhat 
army?” 

‘‘You’re getting pretty snappy 
with the comeback, Joe,” Sam 
muttered. ‘‘My influence, no 
doubt.” 

‘‘I’m not ath dumb ath motht 
people think,” Joe said. 

‘‘That wouldn’t be possible.” 

S AM’S rage had become a dull 
red now. Even with Joe as his 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



bodyguard, he was far from being 
safe. But he was banking on the 
fact that John would go only so far 
with him — John wanted the River- 
boat, too. 

John was sitting at the big round 
oaken table with a dozen of his 
thugs. The giant Zaksksromb was 
standing behind him. All held clay 
steins. The room reeked of tobacco 
and liquor. John's eyes were red — 
but then they usually were. Light 
came in through the windows but 
the direct sunlight was blocked off 
by the kockade poles. Some pine 
torches burned smokily. 

Sam stopped, took a cigar out 
of the little box in the bag hanging 
from his belt and lit it. It angered 
him that his hand shook so much. 

He said, ‘‘All right. Your Maj- 
esty. It was bad enough that you 
took those women for your own 
vile purposes. But to take Gwena- 
fra? She’s a citizen of this state! 
You really put your neck in the 
noose, John, and I’m not just using 
figurative language.” 

John downed the whiskey in the 
stein and gently put it down on the 
table. He said softly, ‘‘I had those 
women removed for their own 
safety. The crowd was ugly; they 
wanted to kill all the missionaries. 
And Gwenafra was taken along 
through a mistake. I will ascertain 
who is responsible for that and 
punish him.” 

“John,” Sam said, “1 ought to 
arrest your assertions for vagrancy. 
They certainly are without any vis- 
ible support. But 1 got to hand it 
to you. You just dispossessed the 
devil. You are now the father of 
lies and grand master, past, present 
and future, of deceit. If being bare- 

127 




faced is the criterion of the great- 
est liar, all other liars are whisker- 
ed like Santa Claus.” 

John's face turned red. Zaksks- 
romb sneered and lifted his club 
chest high. Joe growled. 

John blew out a deep breath and 
said, smiling, “You are upset over 
a little blood. You will get over it. 
You cannot disprove anything I 
have said— isn't that right? By the 
way, have you called a meeting of 
the Council yet? The law of the 
land requires you to do so, you 
know.'' 

The horrible thing was that John 
would get away with his claims. 
Everybody, including his support- 
ers would know he was lying. But 
there was nothing Sam coujd do 
unless he wanted to start a civil 
war. And civil war would mean 
that the wolves— lyeyasu. Hacking, 
maybe the supposed neutrals, Pub- 
lius Crassus, Chernsky, Tai Fung 
and the savages across the River— 
would invade. 

S AM snorted and walked out. 

Two hours later his expectations 
became realities. The Councilmen 
voted an official reprimand against 
John for his mishandling of the 
situation and his hastiness. He was 
directed to confer with his co-Con- 
sul in any such future situations. 

No doubt John would laugh up- 
roariously when he was told of the 
decision and he would call for more 
liquor, tobacco, marihuana and 
women to celebrate. 

However, he did not have a com- 
plete victory. Every Parolando 
knew how Sam Clemens had stood 
up to John, stormed his palace 
with only one supporter, released 

128 



the women and insulted John to 
his face. John knew that his tri- 
umph was standing on shaky legs. 

Sam asked the Council to exile 
every Second Chancer in Paro- 
lando for his/her own protection. 
But several Councilors pointed 
out that this would be illegal. The 
Carta would have to be changed. 
Besides, it was unlikely that John 
would take any more action 
against the sect after the warning 
he had received. 

They knew as well as Sam why 
he was taking advantage of the 
emotional climate to oust the Sec- 
ond Chancers. But there were some 
stubborn men on the Council. Per- 
haps they felt angry because they 
had not been able to do anything 
about John and wanted to make a 
stand for principle. 

Sam would have bet that the 
survivors of the massacre would 
want to leave immediately. But 
they insisted on staying. The 
slaughter had convinced them that 
Parolando needed them. Goering 
was building several large huts for 
them. Sam sent word down that 
this should stop. Parolando was 
already short of wood. Goering 
sent word back that he and his 
male comrades would move out 
and sleep under the grailstones. 
Sam swore and blew smoke in the 
face of the Chancer messenger and 
said that it was too bad pneumonia 
did not exist. Afterward he felt 
ashamed, but he did not relent. He 
wasn't going to scant his furnaces 
so that people he did not even want 
could sleep under a roof. 

He felt upset enough, but that 
evening he got two messages which 
opened the earth under him. One 

IF 




was that Odysseus had disappeared 
at night from his boat while on his 
way back to Parolando. Nobody 
knew what had happened to him. 
He was just gone. The second mes- 
sage informed him that William 
Grevel, the man who had been spy- 
ing on John, had been found under 
a ledge at the base of the moun- 
tain, his skull smashed in. 

Somehow, John had found him 
out and executed him. And John 
would be laughing because Sam 
could not prove a thing or, for that 
matter, even admit that Grevel had 
been working for him. 

S AM called in von Richthofen, 
de Bergerac and others whom 
he considered to be his people. It 
was true that de Bergerac and he 
were hostile bec^luse of Livy, but 
de Bergerac preferred Clemens to 
John, with whom he had had some 
hot words. 

“Maybe Odysseus’ disappear- 
ance from the boat is only a coin- 
cidence,’’ Sam said. “But that, plus 
Grevel’s death, makes we wonder 
if John isn’t striking at me through 
my friends. He may be planning on 
cutting you down, one by one, un- 
der circumstances where he can’t 
be accused. He’s crafty. He prob- 
ably won’t do anything now for 
some time. But Odysseus was got- 
ten rid of in a place where an in- 
vestigation will probably reveal 
nothing. And I can’t accuse John 
about Grevel without exposing 
what I’ve been doing. So, watch 
out for situations where accidents 
can happen. And be careful when 
you are alone.’’ 

De Bergerac swore. “If it weren’t 
for this ridiculous law against 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



dueling, 1 could challenge John and 
run him through. You, Sinjoro 
Clemens, were responsible for that 
law!’’ 

“I was raised in a country where 
duels were common,” Sam said. 
“The whole idea sickens me. ' If 
you’d seen the tragedies — well, 
never mind. I guess you did see 
and it doesn’t seem to have af- 
fected you. Anyway, do you think 
for one moment that John would 
ever let you live long enough to 
meet him for a duel? No, you’d 
disappear or have an accident, you 
can bet on that.” 

“Vhy can’t Chohn have an ac- 
thident?” Joe Miller asked. 

“How would you get past the 
living wall of his bodyguards?” 
Sam said. “No, if John has an ac- 
cident, it must be a genuine one.” 

He dismissed them with the ex- 
ception of de Bergerac and Joe, 
who never left him unless he was 
sick or Sam wanted privacy. These 
were the only ones who knew about 
The Mysterious Stranger. 

“The Stranger said that he’d 
picked out twelve humans for the^ 
final onslaught against the Misty 
Tower,” Sam told Cyrano. “Joe, 
you, Richard Francis Burton, 
Odysseus, and me. That’s five. But 
none of, us knows who the other 
seven are; Now Odysseus is gone 
and God knows if we’ll ever see 
him again. The Stranger implied 
that all of the twelve would join 
the others on the Riverboat some- 
where along the line. But if Odys- 
seus has been resurrected some- 
where to the south, downRiver, so 
far away he can’t get back up here 
before the Riverboat is built, then 
he is out of luck.” 

129 




Cyrano shrugged and rubbed his 
long nose. “Why worry? Or is that 
your nature? For all we know, 
Odysseus is not dead. He may have 
been contacted by this Mysterious 
Stranger — who, Odysseus claims, 
is a woman, so his Stranger is not 
the one that you and I met — but I 
digress. As 1 said, Odysseus may 
have been called away suddenly by 
this so mysterious person and we 
will Find out in time what did hap- 
pen. Let that shadowy angel — or 
fiend— take care of the matter. 
We must concentrate on getting 
this fabulous boat constructed and 
skewering anybody who gets in our 
way.” 

“That maketh thenthe,” Joe 
said. “If Tham had a hair for ev- 
ery time he vorried, he’d look like 
a porcupine. Vhich, now that 1 
come to think of it — ” 

“Out of the mouths of babes — 
and tailless monkeys,” Sam said. 
“Or is it the other end? Anyway, if 
everything goes well — and so far it 
hasn’t — we’ll start bonding the 
magnalium plates for the hull in 
thirty days. That’ll be my happiest 
day until we actually launch the 
boat. I’ll be happier even than when 
Livy said yes — ” 

H e could have cut himself 
off sooner, but he wanted to 
antagonize Cyrano. The French- 
man, however, did not react. Why 
should he? He had Livy — she was 
saying yes to him all the time. 

“Me, 1 do not like the idea, since 
1 am a peaceful man. I would like 
to have the leisure to indulge my- 
self with the good things of life. 1 
would like to have an end to wars 
— and if there is to be any blood- 

130 



shed, let it be between gentlemen 
who know how to wield their 
swords. But we cannot build the 
boat without interference, because 
those who do not have iron desire 
it and will not stop until they get 
it. So, me, I think that John Lack- 
land may be right in one particular. 
Perhaps we should wage an all-out 
war as soon as we have enough 
weapons, and clear The River on 
both sides of all opposition for 
thirty miles both ways. We can 
then have unlimited access to the 
wood and the bauxite and plati- 
num — ” 

“But if you did that, if you kill- 
ed all the inhabitants, the countries 
would be filled up within a day,” 
Sam said. “You know how resur- 
rection works. Look at how swiftly 
this area was reinhabited after the 
meteorite had killed everybody in 
it.” 

Cyrano held up a long — and 
dirty — finger. Sam wondered if 
Livy was losing her battle to keep 
him clean. 

“Ah!” Cyrano said. “But these 
people will remain unorganized 
and we, being on the spot, will or- 
ganize them, take theni in as citi- 
zens of the expanded Parolando. 
We will include them in the lottery 
for the crew of the boat. In the 
long run, it would be faster to stop 
the boat building now and do as I 
suggest.” 

And I will send'you forth in the 
lead, Sam thought. And it will be 
David and Bathseba and Uriah all 
over again. Except that David 
probably didnt have a conscience, 
never lost a wink of sleep over 
what he did . 

“1 don’t think so,” Sam said. 

IF 




'Mn the first place, our citizens will 
fight like hell to defend themselves, 
because they’re involved in the 
boat. But they’re not going to en- 
gage in a war of conquest, espe- 
cially after they figure out that 
bringing new citizens into the lot- 
tery is going to reduce their chances 
enormously. Besides, it just isn’t 
right.” 

De Bergerac stood up, his hand 
on the hilt of his rapier. “Perhaps 
you are right. But the day you 
made an agreement with John 
Lackland and then murdered Erik 
Bloodaxe, that was the day you 
launched your boat on blood and 
treachery and cruelty. I do not re- 
proach you, niy friend. What you 
did was unavoidable if you wanted 
the boat. But yoju cannot start thus 
and then shy away from similar or 
even worse acts. Not if you want 
your boat. Good night, my friend.” 

He bowed and left. Sam puffed 
on his cigar, then said, “I hate that 
man. He tells the truth.” 

Joe stood up, and the floor 
creaked under his eight hundred 
pounds. “I’m goingi to bed. My 
head hurtth. Thith whole thing ith 
giving me a pain in my athth. Ei- 
ther you do or you don’t. It’th 
that thimple.” 

“If I had my brainth in my athth 
I’d thay the thame thing,” Sam 
snarled. “Joe, I love you. You’re 
beautiful. Your world is so uncom- 
plex. Problems make you sleepy — 
so you sleep. But I — ” 

“Good night, Tham!” Joe said, 
and walked into the texas. Sam 
made sure that the door was barred 
and that the guards he’d posted 
around the building were alert. 
Then he, too, went to bed. 



H e dreamed about Erik 
Bloodaxe, who chased him 
through the decks and into the hold 
of the Riverboat. He awoke yell- 
ing. Joe loomed over him, shaking 
him. Rain pounded the roof and 
thunder boomed somewhere up 
along the face of the mountain. 

Joe stayed a while after making 
some coffee. He put a spoonful of 
dried crystals into cold water and 
the coffee crystals heated the mix- 
ture in three seconds. They sipped 
their coffee and Sam smoked 
while they talked about the days 
when they had voyaged down The 
River with Bloodaxe and his Vik- 
ings in search of iron. And then Joe 
talked of how he had awakened 
along The River the first time and 
found himself in the Arctic regions 
among his own kind, the titanth- 
ropi. Then Egyptians had come in 
their oared vessels and he had been 
induced to go with them up The 
River. They called him Tehuti (that 
is, Thoth) because of his long nose, 
which reminded them of the ibis- 
headed god. And then they had 
come to the headwaters of The Riv- 
er and climbed mountains which 
seemed unclimbable. They had 
found their way prepared, some 
steps cut out of the cliff, a tunnel 
bored, a ledge widened, ropes left 
hanging down. The person who had 
done this, Joe now knew, must have 
been Sam’s Mysterious Stranger. 
And then high up on a ledge, with 
the cold gray mists of the north 
polar sea below him and the sun 
creeping along forever just below 
the top of the mountain range that 
ringed the sea, the mists had parted 
for a moment. The top of a tower, 
a vast gray cylinder shaped like a 

131 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 




grail, had been visible for a few 
seconds as the sun passed a notch 
in the mountains. A big egg-shaped 
machine had flown dpwn toward 
the top of the tower. Joe had step- 
ed back, forgetting that there was a 
grail just behind him. He had fallen 
backward off the mountain and 
down into the mists and then into 
the sea, many thousands of feet be- 
low. He had awakened in a region 
of The River where only humans 
lived and there had met Sam Cle- 
mens. 

“At leatht, ve uthed to have fun 
now and then,” Joe said. “But not 
any more. There ’th too much vork 
to do and too many people out to 
thkin our hideth. And your voman 
vould thyow up vith that big- 
nothed Thyrano.” 

Sam chuckled and said^ “Thanks 
for the flrst laugh Tve had in days, 
Joe. Big-nosed! Ye Gods!” 

“Thometimeth I’m too thubtle 
even for you, Tham,” Joe said. He 
rose from the table and walked 
back to his room. 

Sam had little time for sleep that 
night and on subsequent nights. 
He had always liked to stay in bed 
in the mornings — now he managed 
less than five hours out of twenty- 
four, with an occasional siesta. 
Someone always seemed to need a 
question answered or an issue 
thrashed out. His chief engineers 
were far from agreeing on every- 
thing. Sam had thought engineer- 
ing a cut-and-dried profession. 
You had a problem and you solved 
it the best way. Usually there was 
only one way. But Van Boom, Ve- 
litsky, and O’Brien seemed to be 
living in worlds that did not quite 
dovetail. Finally, to spare himself 



the aggravating and often wasted 
hours of wrangling, Sam delegated 
the final word to Van Boom. They 
were not to worry him about any- 
thing unless they needed his au- 
thorization. 

An amazing number of things 
instantly required his authoriza- 
tion. 

IX 

1 YEYASU conquered not only 
the Bushman-Hottentot area 
across The River from him but 
nine miles of the Ulmak territory. 
Then he sent a fleet down to the 
three-mile stretch below the Ul- 
maks, where seventeenth-century 
A.D. Sac and Fox Indians lived. 
This country was conquered with 
resultant slaughter of half the in- 
habitants. lyeyasu then began 
dickering with Parolando for a 
higher price for his wood. Also, he 
wanted an amphibian exactly like 
the Firedragon /. 

By then the second Firedragon 
was almost finished. 

And by this time over five hun- 
dred blacks from Parolando had 
been exchanged for an equal num- 
ber of Dravidians. Sam had stead- 
fastly refused to accept the Wah- 
habi Arabs, or at least had insisted 
that the Asiatic Indians come first. 
Hacking apparently did not like 
this, but nothing had been said in 
the agreement about which group 
had\)riority. 

Hacking, having heard from his 
spies about lyeyasu’s demands, 
sent a message. He wanted a Fire- 
dragon^ too, and he was willing to 
exchange a great quantity of min- 
erals for it.

theoretically equal, though there 
were not many whites around. 
Most of them had been slaughtered 
or fled the country. He had grown 
up with the history of the long ex- 
ploitation and suppression of the 
blacks by the whites drilled into 
him. But he himself had seemed to 
be unaffected by his background 
and he had not come into contact 
with whites who looked down on 
him. He had never left his country. 

Sam decided he did not have to 
worry about Van Boom. 

I N THE middle of the night he 
awoke wondering if he did have 
to worry after all. What if Van 
Boom were not as upright as he 
pretended to be? What if the clever 
Firebrass had told Van Boom to 
go to Clemens with his -story? 
What better way to put a man off 
his guard? But then it would have 
been better if Van Boom had pre- 
tended to Sam that he was playing 
along with Firebrass. 

“I’m beginning to think like 
King John,’’ Sam said aloud. 

He finally decided that he had to 
trust Van Boom. 

The work on the great Riverboat 
went on day and night. The plates 
of the hull were bonded and the 
beams were welded on. The bat- 
acitor and the giant electric motors 
were built and cranes began the 
slow and cautious work of lower- 
ing them into the hull. The cranes 
themselves were enormous struc- 
tures on huge rails, powered by 
electricity from the prototype ba- 
tacitor. People came from thou- 
sands of miles up and down The 
River, in galleys, dugouts, canoes, 
to see the fabulous works. 



Sam and King John agreed that 
so many people wandering about 
would get in the way of the work 
and would enable spies to function 
more efficiently. 

“Also, it’ll put the temptation 
to steal before them, and we don’t 
want to be responsible for tempt- 
ing people. They have enough trou- 
ble as it is,’’ Sam said. 

John did not smile. He signed the 
order that expelled all noncitizens, 
except for ambassadors and mes- 
sengers, fr5m the work area. This 
still did not prevent many boats 
from sailing by while the occupants 
gawked. The dirt and stone walls 
along the bank were about finished 
— there were, however, many 
breaks through which the curious 
could stare. These openings were 
left to provide ingress to freight 
boats bringing wood, ore and flints. 
Moreover, since the plain sloped 
up toward the hills, the tourists 
could see the factories and cranes 
— and the great structure of the 
boatyard itself was visible for miles 
around. 

After a while the tourist trade 
began to peter out. Too many of 
the curious were being picked up 
along the way by grail slavers. 
Word got around that it was be- 
coming dangerous to travel The 
River in that section. Six months 
passed. The wood, supply in the 
area was cut off. Bamboo grew to 
full length in three to six weeks; the 
trees took six months to reach 
complete maturity. Every state for 
fifty miles both ways from Paro- 
lando had enough wood for their 
own uses only. 

Parolando’s representatives 
made treaties with more distant 



134 



IF 




states, trading iron ore and weap- 
ons for wood. A large supply of 
siderite masses was still available; 
Sam was not worried about run- 
ning out of it. But the mining of it 
took many men and materials and 
caused the central part of Parolan- 
do to look like a heavily shelled 
landscape. And the more wood was 
brought in, the more men, materi- 
als and machines had to be diverted 
from the boatbuilding to make 
weapons for trade. Moreover, the 
increase in shipping resulted in 
more demand for lumber to build 
freighters. And more men had to 
be trained and shipped out as sail- 
ors and guards for the wood-carry- 
ing and ore-carrying fleets. Finally 
boats had to be rented from neigh- 
boring states and the rent, as al- 
ways, was iron-nickel ore and fin- 
ished weapons. 

S AM wanted to be with the boat 
from dawn to dusk and even 
later — he loved every minute of 
progress there. But he was caught 
in so many administrative details 
that he could indulge himself for 
only two to three hours — on a good 
day. He tried to get John to take 
over more of the administration, 
but John would accept only duties 
which gave him more power over 
the military forces or allowed him 
to exert pressure on those who op- 
posed him. 

The anticipated attempts at as- 
sassination of those close to Sam 
did not occur. The bodyguards and 
the close watch at nights were con- 
tinued, but Sam decided that John 
was going to lay low for a while. 
He had probably seen that it would 
be best for his purposes to wait un- 



til the boat was nearly finished. 

Once Joe Miller said, “Tham, 
don’t you think maybe you’re 
wrong about Chohn? Maybe he’th 
going to be content vith being the- 
cond in command of the boat?” 
“Joe, would a sabertooth part 
with his canines?” 

“Vhat?” 

“John is rotten to the core. The 
old kings of England were never 
any great shakes, morally speak- 
ing. The only difference between 
them and Jack the Ripper was that 
they operated openly and with the 
sanction of Church and State. But 
John was such a wicked monarch 
that it became traditional never to 
name another English king John. 
Even the Church, which had a high 
tolerance for evil in high places, 
could not stomach John. The Pope 
slapped the Interdict on the entire 
nation and brought John crawling 
and begging to the feet of the Pope, 
like a whipped puppy. But I sup- 
pose that even when he was kissing 
the Pope’s foot, John managed to 
suck a little blood. And the Pope 
must have felt his pockets to make 
sure his money was still there after 
he embraced John. 

“What I’m trying to put across 
is that John couldn’t reform even 
if he wanted to. He’ll always be a 
human weasel, a hyena, a skunk.” 

J OE puffed on a'cigar even longer 
than his nose and said, “Veil, 1

“I know — I know,” Sam said. 
”01d attitudes and what the psy- 
chologists call conditioned reflexes 
can be changed. That’s why I say 
that anybody who still carries in 
him the racial and sexual preju- 
dices he had on Earth is not taking

“He can?” Joe said. “But you

thinkth, ith determined by vhat

everything ith fikthed in itth 
courthe, that humanth math- 
yineth, tho to thpeak, then how can 
you believe that men can chanche

“Well,” Sam drawled, looking 
fierce, his blue-green eyes bright 
above the falcon nose, “even my 
theories are determined in advance 
and if they conflict, that can’t be 
helped.” 

“Then, for heaven’th thaketh,” 
Joe said, throwing up his football- 
sized hands, “vhat’th the uthe of 
talking about it? Or even doing any- 
thing? Voy don’t you chutht give 
up?” 

“Because I can’t help myself,” 
Sam said. “Because, when the first 
atom in this universe bumped 
against the second atom my fate 
was decreed, my every thought and 
action was fixed.” 

“Then you can’t be, uh, rethpon- 
thible for vhat you do, right?” 
“That’s right,” Sam said. He 



began to feel uncomfortable. 

“Then Chohn can’t help it that 
he’th a murdering treacherouth 
thoroughly dethpicable thvine?” 
“No — and I can’t help despising 
him for what he is.” 

“And I thuppothe that if thome- 
body thmarter than 1 am came

undeniable lochic, that you wer^

you vould thay that he can’t help 
thinking you’re wrong? But he’th 
wrong, it’th chutht that he’th pre- 
determined, mechanically, to think 
the vay he doeth.” 

“I’m right and I know it,” Sam 
said, puffing harder. “This hyp- 
pothetical man couldn’t convince 
me because his own reasoning does 
not spring from a free will, which 
is like a vegetarian tiger — that is, 
it doesn’t exist.” 

“But your own reathoning 
doethn’t thpring from a free vill.” 
“True. We’re all screwed. We 
believe what we have to.” 

“You iaugh at thothe people who 
have vhat you call invinthible

of it, yourthelf.” 

“Lord deliver us from apes 
who think they’re philosophers!” 
“Thee! You fall back on in- 
thultth vhen you can’t think of 
anything elthe to thay! Admit it, 
Tham! You haven’t got a loch- 
ical leg to thtand on!” 

“You Just aren’t capable of 
seeing what I mean, because of 
the way you are,” Sam said. 

“You thyould talk to Thyrano

ath big a thynic ath you, although 
he doethn’t go ath far ath you do

“I’d think you two incapable 
of talking to each other. Don’t 
you two resent each other, you 
look so much alike? How can you 
stand nose to nose, as it were, and 
not break up with laughter? It’s 
like two anteaters — ’’ 

“Inthultth! Inthultth! Oh, 
vhat’th the uthe?” 

“Exactly,’’ Sam said. 

Joe did not say good night and 
Sam did not call after him. He 
was nettled. Joe looked so dumb 
with his low forehead, bone-ringed 
eyes, dill-pickle nose, gorilla build 
and hairiness. But behind those 
little blue eyes and the lisping was 
an undeniable intelligence. 

What disturbed him most was 
Joe’s comment that his determi- 
nistic belief was only a rationali- 
zation. To excuse his guilt? Guilt 
for what? Guilt for just about 
everything bad that had happened 
to those whom he loved. 

But it was a philosophic laby- 
rinth which ended in a quagmire. 
Did he believe in determinism be- 
cause he wanted not to feel guilty? 
Or did he feel guilty, even though 
he should not, because the uni- 
verse was so constructed that he 
had to feel guilty? 



H e sat up later than usual 
that night, but not working. 
He drank at least a fifth of ethyl 
alcohol mixed with fruit juice. 

Firebrass had said two months 
earlier he could not understand 
the failure of Parolando to make 
ethyl alcohol. Sam had been up- 
set. He had not known that grain 
alcohol could be made here, had 
thought that the only supply of 



liquor was the limited amount 
that the grails yielded. 

No, Firebrass had said. Hadn’t 
any of his engineers told him? If 
the proper materials, such as acid, 
coal gas, or acetaldehyde and a 
proper catalyst were available 
wood cellulose could be converted 
into ethyl alcohol. 

Sam had called in Van Boom, 
who had stated that he had enough 
to worry about without providing 
booze for people who already 
drank too much. 

Sam had ordered materials and 
men diverted and, for the first 
time in the history of The River, as 
far as anyone knew, potable al- 
cohol began to be made on a 
large scale. This resulted not only 
in happier citizens, except for the 
Second Chancers, hut in a new in- 
dustry for Parolando. Sam ex- 
ported alcohol in exchange for 
wood and bauxite. 

The trade, Sam thought, could 
afford his indulgence this night. 
He finished the bottle, fell into 
bed and, the next morning re- 
fused to get up before noon. But 
the day after he was back at his 
toils. 

He and John sent a message to 
lyeyasu that they would regard it 
as a hostile act if he invaded the 
rest of the Ulmak territory or 
Chernsky’s Land. 

lyeyasu replied that he had no 
intention of waging war on these 
lands and proved it by invading 
the state just north of his, Shesh- 
shub’s Land. Sheshshub was an As- 
syrian, born in the seventh century 
B.C. He had been a general of 
Sargon II, and so, like most pow- 
erful people on Earth, had become 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



137 




a leader 6n the Riverworld. He 
gave lyeyasu a good fight, but the 
invaders were more numerous. 

lyeyasu was only one worry. 
Sam had others. Hacking sent a 
message through Firebrass. He 
wanted Parolando to quit stalling 
and send the amphibian promised 
to him. Sam had kept pleading 
technical difficulties, but Fire- 
brass told him that excuses of 
any kind were no longer accept- 
able. 

Firedragon III was reluctantly 
shipped off. 

S AM made a visit to Chernsky, 
just north of Parolando, to re- 
assure him that Parolando would 
defend Cernskujo. Coming back, 
a half-mile upwind of the factor- 
ies, Sam almost gagged. He had 
been living so long in the acid- 
bath-cum-smoke atmosphere that 
he had gotten used to it and the 
vacation from it had cleansed his 
lungs. The stench set him cough- 
ing. Though the wind was at fif- 
teen mph, it did not carry the 
smoke away swiftly enough. The 
air definitely was hazy. No won- 
der, he thought, that Publiujo, to 
the south, complained. 

But the boat continued to grow. 
Standing before the front port of 
his pilothouse, Sam could look 
out every morning and be con- 
soled for his troubles and for the 
hideousness and stench of the 
land. The three decks would be 
completed in another six months 
and the great paddlewheels would 
be installed. A plastic coating 
would seal the part of the hull in 
contact with water. This plastic 
would not only prevent electroly- 

138 



sis of the magnalium, it would re- 
duce the effect of water turbu- 
lence. Van Boom said the reduc- 
tion would add ten mph to the 
boat’s speed. 

The upper decks would be 
white with red, black and gold 
trimmings. 

During this time Sam received 
some good news. Tungsten and 
iridium had been found in Selinu- 
jo, the country immediately 
south of Soul City. The report 
was brought by a prospector, who 
trusted no one but Sam. He also 
brought some bad news. Selina 
Hastings refused to let Parolando 
mine there. In fact, if she had 
known that a Parolandano had 
been digging along the mountain 
she would have thrown him out. 
She did not want to be unfriend- 
ly — indeed, she loved Sam Clem- 
ens, since he was a human being. 
But she did not approve of the 
Riverboat and she would not per- 
mit anything to go out of her 
land that would help build the 
vessel. 

Sam erupted and, as Joe said, 
“Thyot blue thyit for mileth 
around.” The tungsten was very 
much needed for hardening ma- 
chine tools but even more for 
radios and, eventually, the closed- 
circuit TV sets. The iridium could 
be used to harden platinum for 
various uses — scientific instru- 
ments and surgical tools. 

The Mysterious Stranger had 
told Sam that he had set up the 
deposit of minerals in Sam’s ter- 
ritory, but that his fellow Ethi- 
cals did not know that he had 
done so. Along with the bauxite, 
cryolite, and platinum he had 

IF 




promised tungsten and iridium. 
But an error had evidently been 
made and the latter two metals 
had been deposited several miles 
south of the first three. 

Sam did not tell John at once — 
he needed time to think about the 
situation. John, of course, would 
want to demand that the metals be 
traded to Parolando or that war 
be declared. 

While he was pacing back and 
forth in the pilothouse, clouding 
the room with green smoke, he 
heard drums. The drummers were 
using a code he did not know but 
recognized, after a moment, as 
belonging to Soul City. A few 
minutes later Firebrass was at 
the foot of the ladder and coming 
up. 

**Sinjoro Hacking knows all 
about the discovery of tungsten 
and iridium in Selinujo,” he said. 
“He says that if you can come 
to an agreement with Selina, fine. 
But don’t invade her land. He’d 
regard that as a declaration of 
war on Soul City.’’ , 

Sam looked out the starboard 
port. “Here comes John, hot-foot- 
ing it,’’ he said. “He’s heard the 
news, too. His spy system is al- 
most as good as yours, slower by 
a few minutes. I’d say. I don’t 
k>now where the leaks in my sys- 
tem are, but they’re so wide that 
I’d be sunk if I were a boat — and I 
may be anyway.’’ 

J OHN, his eyes inflamed, his 
face red, entered. Since the in- 
troduction of grain alcohol he had 
put on even more fat and seemed 
half-drunk all the time and all 
drunk half the time. 



Sam was angered but also 
amused. He knew John would 
have liked to have sent a messen- 
ger with a summons, in keeping 
with the dignity of an ex-king. 
But John, in turn, knew that Sam 
would not have answered for a 
long time — if at all — and mean- 
while there was no telling how 
much hankypanky Firebrass and 
Sam would manufacture. 

“What’s going on?’’ John asked, 
glaring. 

“You tell me,’’ Sam said. 
“Something must be on your 
mind.’’ 

“None of your wisecracks,’’ 
John said. Without being asked he 
poured out a quart of purple pas- 
sion into a stein. “I know what 
that drumming was about — even 
if I don’t know the code.’’ 

“I thought as much,’’ Sam said. 
“For your information, in case 
you missed anything — ’’ and he 
told him what Firebrass had said. 

John glared at the offender. 

“The arrogance of you blacks 
is unendurable,’’ John said. “You 
are telling Parolando, a sovereign 
state, how it must conduct itself 
in vital business. Well, I say you 
can’t. We’ll get those metals one 
way or the other. Selinujo doesn’t 
need them; we do. It can’t hurt 
Selinujo to give them up in fair 
trade.’’ 

“In what?’’ Firebrass said. “Sel- 
inujo doesn’t want weapons or al- 
cohol. What can you trade?’’ 

“Peace, freedom from war.’’ 

Firebrass shrugged and grinned, 
incensing John. 

“Sure,’’ Firebrass said, “you 
can make your offer. But what 
Hacking says still goes.’’ 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT

“Hacking has no love for Sel- 
inujo,” Sam said. “He kicked out 
all the Second Chancers, black or 
white.” 

“That’s because they were 
preaching immediate pacifism. 
They also preach and apparently 
practice love for all, regardless of 
color. But Hacking says they’re 
a danger to the state. The blacks 
have to protect themselves, other- 
wise they would be enslaved all 
over again.” 

“TAe blacks?” Sam asked. 

“1/5 blacks,” Firebrass replied, 
grinning. 

This was not the first time Fire- 
brass had given the impression 
that he was not too deeply con- 
cerned with skin color. His identi- 
fication with blacks, as such, was 
weak. His life had noFbeen un- 
touched by radal prejudice, but 
it had not been much affected. 
And he had said things now and 
then that indicated that he would 
like a berth on Sam’s boat. 

All this, of course, could be a 
put-on. 

“We’ll negotiate with Sinjorino 
Halstings,” Sam said. “It would 
be nice to have radios and TV for 
the boat and the machine shops 
could use the tungsten. But we 
can get along without them.” 

He winked at John to indicate 
that he should take this line. But 
John was as stone-headed as 
usual. 

“What we do with Selinujo is 
our problem, nobody else’s.” 

“I’ll tell Hacking,” Firebrass 
said. “But Hacking is a strong 
person. He won’t take any crap 
from anybody, least of all from 
white capitalist imperialists.” 



Sam choked and John stared. 
“That’s how he regards both of 
you,” Firebrass -said. “And the 
way he defines those term^s, you 
are what he says you are.” 
“Because I want this boat so 
badly?” Sam shouted. “Do you 
know what this boat is for, what its 
ultimate goal is?” 

X 

H e fought back his anger, 
sobbing with the effort. He 
felt dizzy. For a moment he had 
almost told Firebrass about the 
Stranger. 

“What is it?” Firebrass said. 
“Nothing,” Sam replied. “Noth- 
ing. 1 just want to get to the head- 
waters of The River. Maybe the 
secret of this whole shebang is 
there? Who knows? But 1 certain-

one who just wants to sit around

wants to do that, more power to

which is designed for travel only, 
not for fighting any battles, some- 
one else will. And that someone 
else may use it to conquer and to 
hold, instead of for tourist pur- 
poses. 

“Now, we’ve gone along with 
Hacking’s demands, paid his 
jacked-up prices for the ores when 
we could have gone down there and 
taken them from him. John’s

tain payments, of course. Say, an 
amphibian and a flying machine? 
He’s wild to fly one of those him- 
self. If he attacked Selinujo 
Hacking couldn’t blame us. And if 
Soul City and lyeyasujo fought 
and Soul City were destroyed and 
lyeyasujo weakened — how could 
we fail to benefit? Moreover, I 
happen to know that Chernsky 
has made a secret compact with 
Soul City and Tifonujo to fight if 
any of them are invaded by 
lyeyasu. The resultant carnage 
would certainly find all of them 
weakened and us strengthened. 
Then we could take them over — or 
at least do what we wanted with- 
out interference. In any case, we 
would have uncontrolled access 
to the bauxite and the tungsten.” 

The skull under that- mass of 
tawny hair must hold a thunder- 
mugful of worms, Sam thought. 
Worms that fed on corruption 
and intrigue and deviousness. 
John was so crooked, he was ad- 
mirable. 

“Did you ever meet yourself 
coming around a corner?” Sam 
asked 

“What?” John looked up. “Is 
this another of your unintelli- 
gible insults?” 

“Believe me, it’s as close to a 
compliment as you’ll ever get 
from me. What you’re suggesting 
is all hypothetical. But if lyeyasu 
did attack Selinujo, what excuse 
would he have? They’ve never 
offended him and they’re sixty 
miles away from him on our side of 
The River.” 

“When did any nation ever need 
a reasonable excuse for invad- 
ing another?” John asked. “But 

142 



the fact is that Selinujo keeps 
sending missionaries into 
lyeyasujo, though he has kicked 
out all Chancers. Since Selinujo 
won’t stop doing this — ” 

“Well,” Sam said, “I couldn’t 
let Parolando get involved in a 
deal like this. But if lyeyasu de- 
cides on his own to fight, there’s 
nothing we can do about it.” 

“And you call me dishonest?” 
“There’s nothing I could do 
about it,” Sam said, clamping 
down on his cigar. “Nothing. And 
if something develops that’s 
good for the boat — we’ll take ad- 
vantage of it.” 

“The shipments from Soul City 
would be held up while the fighting 
was going on,” John said. 

“We’ve got enough stock to keep 
going for a week. The big worry 
would be wood. Maybe lyeyasu 
would be able to keep that coming 
even with a war going on, since the 
fighting will be south of us. We 
could handle the chopping and 
transportation ourselves. If he 
didn’t plan to invade for a cdUple 
of weeks we could lay in extra 
stocks of ore from Soul City by 
offering Hacking increased pay- 
ments. Maybe promise him an air- 
plane, the APM-One. That’s just a 
toy — now that we’ve almost got 
our first amphibian airplane fin- 
ished. All this is hypothetical—” 
“I understand,” John said. He 
was not trying to mask his con- 
tempt. 

Sam felt like shouting at him 
that he had no right to be con- 
temptuous. Whose idea had this 
whole bloodbath been, anyway? 

It was the next day that the three 
chief engineers were killed. 



IF 




S AM was there when it hap- 
pened. He was standing on the 
scaffolding by the starboard side 
of the boat, looking down into the 
open hull. The colossal steam crane 
was lifting the immense electric 
motor which would be driving the 
port paddlewheel. The motor had 
been moved during the night from 
the building where it had been 
built. The moving had taken over 
eight hours and had been effected 
by the crane, which also had a gi- 
gantic winch. The winch, plus hun- 
dreds of men pulling on cables, 
had pulled the motor on its big car, 
which moved on steel rails. 

Sam rose at dawn to watch the 
final work, the lifting and then the 
lowering of the motor into the hull 
and its attachment to the paddle- 
wheel axle. The three engineers 
were standing in the bottom of 
the hull. Sam called down to them 
to get away, that they were too vul- 
nerable if the motor should drop. 
But the engineers were stationed 
in three different places so that 
they could transmit signals to the 
men on the port scaffolding, who, 
in turn, were signaling the crane 
operator. 

Van Boom turned to look up at 
Sam and his teeth flashed whitely 
in his dark face. His skin looked 
purplish in the light of the big elec- 
tric lamps. 

And then it happened. A cable 
snapped, then another. The motor 
swung out to one side. The en- 
gineers froze for an instant. Then 
they ran, but they were too late. 
The motor fell and crushed all 
three of them. 

The impact shook the great hull 
and the vibrations made the scaf- 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



folding on which Sam stood quiver 
as if a quake were passing through 
the land. 

Blood ran out from under the 
motor. 

It took five hours to put new 
cables on the crane and lift the 
motor. The bodies were removed; 
the hull was washed out and the 
motor was lowered agaiiv. A close 
inspection had determined that 
the damage to the motor would not 
affect its operation. 

Sam was so depressed that he 
would have liked to have gone to 
bed jmd remained there for a 
week. But he could not leave the 
boat. The work had to go on and 
while there were good men who 
would see to it that it did, Sam did 
not want them to know how shaken, 
he was. Van Boom and Velitsky 
were Sam’s only engineers from 
the twentieth century. 

T hree days after the accident 
he asked Firebrass into his 
pilothouse for a private confer- 
ence. After giving him a cigar and 
scotch Sam asked Firebrass to 
take over as chief engineer. 

Firebrass almost dropped his 
cigar. 

“Steer me, stymate! Do I read 
you unfrosted? You want me as 
your number one dillion?’’ 

“Maybe we should talk in 
Esperanto,’’ Sam said. 

“Okay,’’ Firebrass said. “I’ll 
bring it down to dirt. Just what do 
you want?’’ 

“I’d like you to get permission to 
work for me on a temporary basis, 
supposedly.’’ 

“Supposedly?’’ 

“The job is yours permanently if 

143 




you want it. On the day the boat 
sets out on the long journey you 
can be its chief engineer.” 

Fiberbrass sat silent for a long 
time. Sam rose to pace back and 
forth. Occasionally he looked 
through the ports. The crane had 
put in the starboard motor and 
was now lowering parts of the 
batacitor into the hull. The huge 
installation would be thirty-six 
feet high when fully assembled. A 
trial run would check its operation 
and that of the motors. A double 
cable, six inches thick, would be 
run out for two hundred feet and 
its free end, attached to a large 
shallow hemisphere, would be 
slipped onto the nearest grail- 
stone. When the stone delivered 
its tremendous electrical energy, 
the energy would be transmitted 
by the cables into the batacitor, 
which would store it. The power 
would be drawn out at a controlled 
rate to run the electrical motors. 

Sam turned away from the port. 
“It’s not as if I were asking you to 
betray your country,” he said. 
“In the first place, all you have to 
do now is to request permission 
from Hacking to work for me on 
the building of the boat. You can 
make up your mind later about go- 
ing with us. Which would you 
rather do? Stay in Soul City where 
there is actually little to do 
except indulge yourself? Or go 
with us on the greatest adventure 
of all?” 

Firebrass said slowly, “If I ac- 
cepted your offer — //, I say — I 
would not want to go as chief en- 
gineer. 1 would prefer to be the 
chief of your air force.” 

“That’s not as important a 

144 



position as the chief engineer’s.” 
“It’s a lot more work and 
responsibility. And I like the idea 
of flying again — ” 

“You can fly! You can fly! But 
you’d have to serve under von 
Richthofen. You see, I promised 
him that he would be the chief of 
our air force — which, after all, will 
only consist of two planes. What 
do you care whether or not you’re 
the chief as long as you get to fly?” 
“It’s a matter of pride. I have 
thousands of hours more flying 
time than Richthofen — in planes 
far more complex and bigger and 
speedier. And I was an astronaut. 
I’ve been to the Moon and Mars 
and orbited Jupiter.” 

“That doesn’t mean anything,” 
Sam said. The planes you’ll be fly- 
ing are very primitive. More like 
the World War I machines that 
Lothar flew,” 

“Why does a black always have 
to take second place?” 

“That’s unfair,” Sam said. “You 
could be the chief engineer. You’d 
have thirty-five people under your 
command. Listen, if I hadn’t 
made Lothar that promise, you’d 
get the captaincy, believe me.” 
Firebrass stood up. “I’ll tell you 
what. I’ll help you build the boat 
and set up the training of your en- 
gineers. But I get to fly during that 
time, too — and when the time 
comes we’ll talk about who’s go- 
ing to be head of the air force.” 

“I won’t break my promise to 
Lothar,” Sam said. 

“Yes, but many things may hap- 
pen between now and then.” 

S AM was relieved in one way 
but disturbed in another. 

IF 




Hacking gave his permission, via 
drum, for Parolando to use Fire- 
brass. This suggested to Sam that 
Hacking wanted Firebrass to 
know the boat’s operation be- 
cause he might be serving Hack- 
ing as chief engineer some day. As 
for Firebrass — he might be plan- 
ning to remove von Richthofen 
before the boat- was ready for 
launching. Firebrass did not seem 
like a cold-blooded murderer but 
looks meant nothing where hu- 
mans were concerned. 

Hacking sent word a few days 
later that he would agree to a large 
shipment of minerals in return 
for the AM P-1. Firebrass flew it 
the thirty-one miles to the north- 
ern limit of Soul City, where an- 
other flier, a black who had been a 
general in the U.S. Air Force, 
took it over. Firebrass returned 
by sailboat a few days later. 

The batacitor and the electric 
motors worked perfectly. The 
paddlewheels turned over slowly 
in the air, then were speeded up 
until the vanes whistled. When the 
time came a canal would be dug 
from the water’s edge to the great 
boat and it would wheel out into 
The River under its own power. 

Lothar von Richtofen and 
Gwenafra were not getting along 
at all. Lothar had always been a 
lady killer and he could not seem to 
help flirting. More often than not 
he followed up the flirtation. 
Gwenafra had some definite ideas 
about fidelity with which Lothar 
agreed only in principle. The prac- 
tice tripped him up. 

Hacking finally agreed to visit 
Parolando. He wanted to hold a 
series of conferences on trade, to 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



check on the well-being of Paro- 
lando’s black citizens and to see 
the great Riverboat. 

Sam announced that he would be 
happy to receive Hacking. He 
wasn’t, but the essence of diplo- 
macy was dissimulation even in 
this new life. The preparations for 
housing Hacking and his large 
entourage and setting up the con- 
ferences occupied Sam. He did 
not get much chance to supervise 
the work on the boat. 

Special preparations also had to 
be made for docking the large 
number of ore boats from Soul 
City. Hacking was sending three 
times as much as the normal ship- 
ment to show his sincerity and de- 
sire for peace and understanding. 
Sam would have preferred that the 
shipments be spaced out, but he 
also wanted to get as much ore as 
possible in as short a time as pos- 
sible. The spies said that lyeyasu 
was collecting several large fleets 
and a great number of fighting 
men on both sides of The River. 
And he had sent more messages to 
Selinujo to stop trying to land 
their missionaries on his territory. 

XI 

H ACKING’S boat docked 
about an hour before noon. 
It was a large, two-masted, fore- 
and-aft rigged ship. Hacking’s 
bodyguard, tall well-muscled 
blacks holding steel battle axes 
(but with Mark I pistols in big 
holsters) marched down the gang- 
plank. Their kilts were pure black 
and their leather helmets and cuir- 
asses and boots were of black fish 
skin. They formed in ranks of six 

145 




on each side of the gangplank. 
Finally Hacking himself disem- 
barked. 

He was a tall well-built man with 
a dark brown skin, somewhat 
slanting eyes, a broad pug nose, 
thick lips and a prominent chin. 
He wore a black towel as a cloak, a 
black kilt and leather sandals. His 
only weapon was a rapier in a 
sheath at his broad leather belt. 

Sam gave the signal and a 
cannon loomed twenty-one times. 
The salute was intended not only 
to honor Hacking but to impress 
him. Only Parolando had artil- 
lery, even if it consisted of only 
one .75 mm. cannon. 

The introductions took place." 
Hacking did not offer to shake 
hands, nor did Sam and John. Both 
had been warned by Fif^rass that 
Hacking did not care to shake 
hands with a man unless he re- 
garded him as a proven friend. 

Some small talk followed while 
the grails of Hacking’s people 
were set on the nearest grailstone. 
After the discharge of energy at 
high noon the grails were removed 
and the chiefs of state, accom- 
panied by their bodyguards and 
guards of honor, walked to John’s 
palace. John had insisted that the 
first meeting be held in his place, 
doubtless to impress Hacking 
with John’s primacy. Sam had not 
argued. Hacking probably knew 
from Firebrass how things stood 
between Clemens and Lackland. 

Later Sam found some grim 
amusement in John’s discomfi- 
ture at being bearded in his own 
house. Hacking seized the floor 
during lunch and held it with a 
long and vitriolic speech about the 

146 



evils the white man had inflicted 
on the black. The trouble was. 
Hacking’s indictments were 
valid. Everything he said was true, 
Sam had to admit. Hell, he had 
seen slavery and what it meant and 
had seen the aftermath of the Civil 
War. He had been born and raised 
in it. And he had written Huckle- 
berry Finn and Pudd*nhead Wil- 
son and A Connecticut Yankee, 

T he high-pitched voice went on 
and on, mixing obscenities with 
facts, lurid tales of miseries, beat- 
ings, murders, starvation, humil- 
iations. 

Sam felt guilty and ashamed 
and, at the same time, angry. 

‘*You are all guilty!” Hacking 
shouted. “Every white man is 
guilty!” 

“I never saw more than a dozen 
blacks before I died,” John said. 
“What can I have to do with your 
tale of unjustices?” 

“If you had been born five hun- 
dred years later you would have 
been the biggest honky of them 
all,” Hacking said. “I know all 
about you — ” 

Sam suddenly stood up and 
shouted, “Did you come here to 
tell us about what happened on 
Earth? We know what happened. 
But that’s the past. Earth is dead. 
What’s taking place now counts.” 
“Yeah,” Hacking said. “And 
what’s taking place now is what 
took place on good old Earth. 
Things haven’t changed one little 
bit. 1 look around here and who 
heads up this country? Two honk- 
ies! Where are the black men? 
Your black population is about 
one-tenth of your total. You ought 

IF 




to have at least one black on a ten- 
man Council! Do I see one? Just 
one?” 

‘There’s Cawber,” Sam said. 

“Yeah. A temporary member 
and he’s that only because I de- 
manded you send me a black am- 
bassador.” 

“The Arabs make up about a 
sixth of your state,” Sam said, 
“and there isn’t one Arab on your 
council.” 

“They’re white, that’s why. And 
I’m getting rid of them. Don’t get 
me wrong— many Arabs are good 
men, unprejudiced men. I met 
them when I was a fugitive in 
North Africa. But these Arabs are 
religious fanatics and they won’t 
stop making trouble — so out they 
go! What we blacks want is a solid 
black country, where we’re all soul 
brothers. Where we can live in 
peace and understanding. We’ll 
have our own kind of life and you 
honkies can have yours. Segrega- 
tion with a capital S, Charlie! 
Here, a big S segregation can 
work, cause we don’t have to de- 
pend on the white man for our jobs 
or food or clothing or protection 
or justice. We’ve got it made, 
whitey. All we have to do is tell you 
to go to hell, keep away from us 
and we got it made!” 

F I REBRASS sat at the table, 
his dark-red kinky head bent, 
looking down, his bronzed hands 
over his face. Sam had the feeling 
that he was trying to keep from 
laughing. But whether he was 
laughing at Hacking or his hosts, 
Sam could not guess. Perhaps he 
was laughing at both. 

John kept drinking but the red- 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



ness of his face came from more 
than the liquor. He looked ready to 
explode at any moment. It was 
difficult to swallow insults about 
your injustice to blacks when you 
were innocent — but then John 
was guilty of so many hideous 
crimes that he should suffer for 
some, even if they were committed 
by others. And, as Hacking said, 
John would have been guilty of 
racial bias if he had been given the 
chance. 

Hacking finally quit talking. 
Sam Clemens said, “Well, we 
didn’t plan on any after-dinner 
speeches, but I thank you for your 
volunteering— we all thank you 
as long as you don’t charge us for 
it. Our exchequer is rather low at 
the moment.” 

Hacking said, “You have to 
make a joke out of it, don’t you? 
Well, how about a tour? I’d love to 
see that big boat of yours.” 

The rest of the day passed rather 
pleasantly. Sam forgot his anger 
and his resentments while con- 
ducting Hacking through the fac- 
tories, the shops and, finally, 
through the boat. Even half-fin- 
ished, it was magnificent. The 
most beautiful sight he had ever 
seen; Even, he thought, even — yes, 
even more beautiful than Livy’s 
face when she had first said she 
loved him. 

Hacking did not become 
ecstatic, but he was deeply im- 
pressed. He could not, however, 
refrain from commenting on the 
stench and the desolation. 

Sam was called away shortly 
before supper. A man who had 
landed from a small boat had de- 
manded to see the ruler of the 

147 




land. A Clemens man had taken 
him in^ and sent for Sam. He went 
off at once in one of the two alco- 
hol-burning “jeeps” that had been 
finished only a week before. A 
slender blond youth at the guard- 
house introduced himself, in Es- 
peranto, as Wolfgang Amadeus 
Mozart. 

Sam questioned him in German, 
noting that, whatever the youth’s 
identity, he did speak the soft Aus- 
trian version of High German. 
He said that he had lived about 
twenty thousand miles up The 
River. He heard about the 
boat — and that it would carry an 
orchestra for the amusement of 
passengers. The instruments 
would be those that Earth had 
known. Mozart had suffered for 
twenty-three years in this world of 
limited materials, where the only 
musical instruments were drums, 
whistles, wooden flutes, pan pipes 
and a crude sort of harp made of 
bone and the guts of a Riverfish. 
The great Riverboat’s orchestra, 
he had heard, would feature piano, 
violin, flute, horns and all the other 
beautiful instruments he had 
known on Earth, plus others that 
had been invented since his death 
in 1791. And here he was. Was 
there a place for him in the music- 
making ranks of the boat? 

Sam was an appreciator, though 
not a passionate lover, of some 
classical music. But he was thrilled 
at meeting the great Mozart face 
to face. That is, if this man truly 
were Mozart. Phonies on The 
River were claiming to be every- 
body from the original one-and- 
only Jesus Christ down to P. T. 
Barnum, and Sam took no man’s 

148 



word for his identity. He had even 
met three men who claimed to be 
Mark Twain. 

“It just so happens that the 
former archbishop of Salzburg is 
a citizen of Parolando,” Sam 
said. “Even though you and he 
parted on bad terms, if I remem- 
ber correctly, he’ll be glad to see 
you.” 

Mozart turned neither pale nor 
red. He said, “At last, somebody I 
knew during my lifetime! Would 
you believe — ” 

Sam would believe that Mozart 
had not met anybody he had 
known on Earth. So far he himself 
had met only three people he’d 
known and his acquaintanceship 
had been extensive during his 
long life and worldwide travels. 
That his >\ife Livy was one of the 
three was a coincidence exceed- 
ing the bounds of probability. He 
suspected that the Mysterious 
Stranger had arranged that. But 
even Mozart’s eagerness at see- 
ing the archbishop again did not 
confirm that he was indeed Mo- 
zart. In the first place, the im- 
posters that Sam had met had fre- 
quently insisted that those who 
were supposed to be their old 
friends were either mistaken or 
else imposters themselves. They 
had more gall than France. In the 
second place, the archbishop of 
Salzburg did not live in Paro- 
lando. Sam had no idea where he 
was. He had sprung him just to test 
Mozart’s reaction. 

Sam agreed that Mozart could 
appjy for citizenship. First, he 
straightened him out about the 
musical instruments. These had 
not been made yet. Nor would they 

IF 




be wood or brass. They would be 
electronic devices which could re- 
produce exactly the sounds of 
various instruments. But if Mo- 
zart were indeed the man he 
claimed jto be he had a good chance 
of being the conductor of the 
orchestra. And he could have all 
the time he wanted to compose 
new works. 

Sam did not bind himself to any- 
thing, He. had ‘learned his lesson 
about making promises. 

A BIG party was held at John’s 
palace in honor of Hacking, 
who seemed to have discharged his 
venom for the day at the first meet- 
ing. Sam talked with him for an 
hour and found that Hacking was 
an intelligent and literate man 
with a flair for the imaginative and 
the poetic. 

Near midnight Sam accom- 
panied Hacking and party to the 
big thirty-room, second-story, 
stone-and-bamboo building set 
aside for state guests. Then he 
dr(^e his jeep to his home, three 
hundred yards away. Joe sulked a 
little because he had wanted to 
drive, even though his legs were far 
too long. They staggered up the 
ladder and barred the door. Joe 
went into the rear and flopped on 
his bed with a crash that shook the 
house' on its stilts. Sam looked out 
through the ports just in time to see 
Cyrano and Livy, their arms 
around each other, lurch into the 
door of their hut. To their left, set 
above them, was von Richthofen’s 
hut, where he and Gwenafra had 
already gone to bed. 

He muttered, ‘‘Good night — ” 
not knowing exactly whom he 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



was addressing, and fell inta his 
own bed. It had been a long, hard 
and trying day. 

He awoke dreaming that he was 
caught in a California earthquake 
on the Fourth of July. 

H e leaped out of bed and 
ran on the trembling floor to 
the Pilothouse. Even before he 
reached the ports he knew that the 
explosions and the earth-shaking 
were caused by invaders. He never 
reached the ports, because a 
rocket, its tail flaming red, struck 
one of the stilts. The roar deafened 
him, smoke whirled in through the 
broken ports, and he pitched for- 
ward. The house collapsed and its 
front part fell down. 

He banged into the wood and 
broken glass and earth and lay 
stunned. A big hand picked him up. 
By the light of an explosion he 
saw Joe’s great-nosed face. Joe had 
climbed down from the open end of 
his room and thrown aside the 
lumber until he had found Sam. He 
held his grail and Sam’s in his left 
hand. 

“I don’t know how — ^^it’s a 
miracle — but I’m not hurt bad,” 
Sam said. ‘‘Just bruised and cut by 
glass.” 

‘‘1 didn’t have time to put on my 
armor,” Joe said. ‘‘But I got my 
akthe. Here’th a thword for you 
and a pithtol and thome bulletth 
and powder charcheth.” 

‘‘Who the hell can they be, Joe?” 
Sam said. 

“I don’t know. Thee — they’re 
coming in through the holeth in 
the vallth vhere the dockth are.” 
The starlight was bright. The 
clouds that sent the rains down 

149 




every night at three o’clock had not 
yet come but the mists over The 
River were heavy. Out of them men 
were still pouring to add to the 
masses spreading over the plains. 
Beyond the walls, in the mists, 
must be a fleet. 

The only fleet that could get 
close without causing an alarm 
would be the Soul City fleet. Any- 
body else arriving at this hour 
would have had to have been with- 
in view of the spies Sam and John 
Lackland had set up along The 
River, even in hostile territory, 
lyeyasu’s fleet was still sitting in 
its docks, according to a report 
Sam had received just before 
midnight. 

Joe [^ered over a pile of wood 
and said, “There’th a hell of a 
battle around Chohn’th palathe. 
And the guetht houthe — vhere 
Hacking and hith boyth vath — ith 
on fire.” 

The flames lit a number of 
bodies on the ground and showed 
tiny figures struggling around the 
log stockade of John’s palace. 
Then the cannon was pushed be- 
fore the stockade. 

“That’s John’s jeep,” Sam said, 
pointing at the vehicle which had 
just driven up behind the cannon. 

“Yeah — and it’th our cannon,” 
Joe said. “But it’th Hacking’th 
men that’re going to blatht Chohn 
out of hith little love netht.” 

“Let’s get to hell out of here,” 
Sam said and scrambled over the 
lumber and in the opposite direc- 
tion. He could not understand why 
the invaders had hot yet sent men 
to his house. The rocket that had 
hit the Pilothouse had come from 
the plains. And if Hacking and his 

150 



men had sneaked out of the guest- 
house to launch a surprise attack 
in conjunction with an attack 
from the supposed ore boats, then 
Sam should have been a primary 
target along with John Lackland. 

He’d find out later what it was 
all about — if there was a later. 

XII 

T hat Hacking’s men had got- 
ten hold of the cannon was 
bad news for Parolando. Sam 
heard the big gun boom. He 
whirled in his flight and saw pieces 
of wood flying out of the smoke. 
John’s walls were wide open and 
the next few shells should reduce 
his log palace to rubble. 

There was only one good thing 
about the invaders having their 
hands on the cannon. The supply 
of shells was limited to fifty. Even 
with the many tons of nickel-iron 
still in the ground, metal was not so 
common that it could be wasted to 
any extent on explosive shells. 

Ahead was Livy’s hut. The door 
was open and the place was empty. 
Sam looked up the hill. Lothar 
von Richthofen, clad only in a kilt, 
carrying a rapier in one hand and 
a pistol in the other, was running 
toward him. A few paces behind 
him came Gwenafra with a pistol 
and a bag of bullets and gun- 
powder packages. 

Other men and women were 
coming toward Sam. Among them 
were a few crossbowmen. 

He shouted at Lothar to or- 
ganize them and turned to look 
down toward The River. The docks 
were still black with men. If only 
the cannon could have been turned 

IF 




to catch them packed together and 
unable to retreat. But the cannon 
had been wheeled around from 
John’s flaming palace and was be- 
ing trained on Parolandanoj hurry- 
ing up the hill. 

Then a big dark machine came 
through a wide breach in the wall. 
Sam cried out with dismay. It was 
the Firedragon III. But where were 
the three amphibians of Paro- 
lando? 

Presently he saw two coming to- 
ward the hills. The steam machine 
guns in the turrets began to stut- 
ter and his men — his men — were 
falling. 

The Soul Citizens had captured 
the amphibians. 

Everywhere he looked he saw a 
battle raging. Men were fighting 
around the Riverboat. He cried 
out again, because he could not 
endure the thought of its being 
damaged. But no cannon shells 
were delivered near it. Apparently 
the enemy was as concerned about 
it as he was. 

Rockets from the hills soared 
overhead and blew up among the 
invaders below. Enemy rockets 
rose in reply; scores of red flames 
streaked above; some came so 
close Sam could see the blur of the 
cylindrical body, the long bamboo 
stick protruding from the rear. 

The next half-hour — or was it 
two hours? — was a shrieking, yell- 
ing, shouting, gunpowder-stink- 
ing, blood-stinking, sweating, 
bowel-churning chaos. Time after 
time the Soul Citizens charged up 
the hill and time after time they 
were repelled by rockets, by .69 
caliber plastic bullets, by cross- 
bow bolts and longbow arrows. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



Then a charge carried the enemy 
through to the defenders and it 
was rapier, broadsword, axe, club, 
spear, and dagger that drove them 
back. 

J OE MILLER, ten feet high and 
eight hundred pounds, his hairy 
hide drenched with blood — his own 
and that of others — swung his axe 
with its eighty-pound nickel-steel 
head at the end of an oak shaft 
three inches thick and six feet long. 
It crashed through oak shield ai^ 
leather armor, brushed aside 
rapiers and spears and axes, split 
breastbones, took off arms and 
necks, halved skulls. When his en- 
emies refused to come near him, 
he charged them. Time and again, 
he broke up assaults that might 
otherwise have succeeded. 

Mark I pistols were fired at him, 
but the shooters were so unnerved 
by him that they fired from too far 
away and missed. Then an arrow 
went through Joe’s left arm and a 
man braver — or more fool- 
hardy — than the rest stepped un- 
der his axe and thrust a rapier into 
his thigh. The butt end of the shaft 
came back and broke the at- 
tacker’s jaw and then the reversed 
axe severed his head. Joe could 
still walk, but he was losing blood 
fast. Sam ordered him to retreat 
to the other side of the hill, where 
the badly wounded were being 
treated. 

Joe said, “No — I ain’t going — ’’ 
and fell to his knees with a groan. 

“Get back there — that’s an or- 
der!’’ Sam screamed and ducked, 
though it was too late. A bullet 
whistled past his ear and shattered 
against the side of an irontree. 

151 




Some of the plastic must have ric> 
ocheted; he felt a stinging in his 
arm and calf. 

Joe managed to heave himself 
up and shamble off. Cyrano de 
Bergerac appeared from the dark- 
ness; he was covered with dirt and 
soot, streaked with blood. He 
gripped the basket hilt of a long 
bloody rapier in one hand and a 
pistol in the other. Behind him, 
equally disheveled, her long dark 
hair loose and flying, was Livy. 
She carried a pistol and a bag of 
ammunition, and her function 
seemed to be to reload the pistols. 
Seeing Sam, she smiled, her teeth 
white in the powder-blackened 
face. 

“My God, Sam — I thought you 
were dead. That rocH.et ,against 
your house — “ 

“I wish you were behind me in 
this,” he said. 

It was all he had time to say, 
though he would not have said 
more whatever the case. The ene- 
my mounted another charge, men 
slipping and sliding over the piles 
of the fallen or leaping over them. 
The bowmen by now seemed out of 
ammunition and the pistoleers 
were using theirs sparingly. But 
the enemy had about expended its 
powder, too, though it had more 
arrows. 

Joe Miller was gone, but Cyrano 
de Bergerac tried to make up for 
the loss and came close to doing 
so. The man was a demon, as 
deadly and elusive as the rapier he 
wielded. From time to time he 
fired the pistol in his left hand 
pointblank into an opponent's face 
while lunging with the rapier to 
skewer another. He would toss the 



empty gun behind him; Livy would 
catch and reload it. Sam thought 
briefly of the change that had come 
about in Livy. He had never sus- 
pected her potential for action un- 
der conditions like these. The frail, 
often sickly, violence-loathing 
woman was coolly performing du- 
ties that many men would have 
run from. 

Among them me — if fd had any 
time to think about it , 



C YRANO thrust beneath a 
shield that an amok Wahhabi 
Arab lifted too high in his frenzy 
and Livy, seeing that she had to do 
it, that Cyrano could not, held the 
pistol in both hands and fired. The 
hammer made the barrel swerve. 
She brought it back into line — 
smoke and flame spurted out, and 
an Arab fell back with his shoul- 
der torn off. 

A massively built attacker leaped 
over the body, axe raised in both 
hands and Cyrano ran him through 
the adam’s apple. 

The enemy retreated down the 
hill again. An amphibian — a Mer- 
rimac on wheels, Sam thought — 
huffed into the action. Lothar von 
Richthofen pushed against Sam, 
who stepped aside when he saw the 
aluminum-alloy tube Lothar and 
a helper were setting up. The help- 
er kneeled while Lothar loaded a 
rocket with a ten-pound warhead 
into the bazooka and aimed it. Lo- 
thar was good. The rocket sailed 
down, its fiery arc ending against 
the front of the amphibian. Lothar 
scored a bull’s-eye. Smoke covered 
the monster, lifted. The amphibi- 
an had stopped — but it came on 

IF 



152 




presently, its turrets turning, steam 
guns lifting. 

“Well, that was the last one,’’ 
Lothar said. “We might as well 
get the hell out of here. We can’t 
fight that. Who should know bet- 
ter than we, heh?’’ 

The enemy was reforming be- 
hind the armored vehicle. Many 
were uttering the ululating cries 
which the Ulmaks, the pre-Amer- 
inds across The River, made dur- 
ing charges. .Apparently Hacking 
had enlisted those not yet con- 
quered by lyeyasu. 

Suddenly Sam could not see as 
well as before. Only the fires from 
the burning houses limned the 
scene. The rain clouds had come 
swiftly, as they always did — like 
wolves chasing the stars. Within a 
few minutes it would rain savage- 

ly- 

He looked and listened. The de- 
fenders had been thinned out. 
Fighting was still going on to north 
and south, on the plains and the 
hills along the plains. But the 
shooting and the cries had less- 
ened. 

The night seemed to him filled 
with the enemy. He wondered if 
Publiujo and Tifonujo had joined 
the invasion. 

He took a last look at the giant 
hull of the Riverboat with its two 
paddlewheels, half-hidden beneath 
the scaffolding and behind the co- 
lossal cranes. Then he turned. He 
felt like weeping, but he was too 
numbed. It would be some time be- 
fore the tears would come. 

It was more likely that his blood 
would run out before then, after 
which there would be no tears. Not 
in this body, anyway. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



G uided by the fires of a doz- 
en scattered huts, Sam and a 
handful of his men stumbled down 
the other side of the hill. The rains 
smashed down. A tentacle of the 
enemy force ran toward them from 
the left. Sam turned and pulled the 
trigger of his flintlock; the rain, of 
course, drowned out the spark. But 
the enemy’s pistols were also ren- 
dered useless. 

Hacking’s men came at the Pa- 
rolandanoj with their swords and 
spears and axes. Joe Miller lunged 
forward, growling with a voice as 
deep as a cave bear’s. Though 
wounded, he was still a formidable 
and terrifying fighter. By the flash- 
es of lightning and the rumbling of 
thunder, his axe cut down attack- 
ers. Others jumped in to help him 
and in a few seconds the Soul Cit- 
izens decided they had had enough. 
They backed away to wait for re- 
inforcements. Why get killed now 
when victory was theirs? ^ 

Sam and his people crossed two 
more hills. The enemy attacked 
sporadically. Joe Miller and Cyra- 
no continued formidable, but when 
Sam finally counted his group of 
survivors he was shaken. Fifteen. 
Where had they all gone? He would 
have sworn that at least a hundred 
had been with him when he had set 
out from the main field of battle. 

Livy was still close behind Cyra- 
no. Guns were useless now, but she 
kept at Cyrano’s back and helped 
him with a spear thrust when she 
could. 

Sam was cold and wet. And he 
was as miserable as Napoleon must 
have been on the retreat from 
Russia. All, all gone! His proud 
little nation and its nickel-iron 

153 




mines, its factories and its in> 
vulnerable amphibians with their 
steam guns, its two airplanes and 
the fabulous Riverboat — all gone! 
The technological triumphs and 
marvels, the Magna Carta with 
the most democratic constitution 
any country had ever known- 
gone. And the greatest journey 
ever to be made would never be 
made. 

How had it all been lost? 
Through treachery, base treachery. 

At least King John had not been 
part of the betrayal. His palace had 
been demolished— and he along 
with it, in all probability. The 
Great Betrayer had been betrayed. 

Sam quit grieving then. He was 
still too frozen with the terror of 
battle to think for long about any- 
thing except survival. * 

At the base of the mountain, he 
led his group north along it until 
they were opposite the dam. A lake 
about a quarter of a mile long and 
a half a mile wide was before them. 
They followed the shoreline to a 
thick, concrete dam and walked 
across it. 

Sam paced until he found a 
sunken symbol, a diagonal cross, 
in the concrete. He called, “Here it 
is. Now, if nobody squeals on 
us— “ 

H e let himself down into cold 
water while the lightning 
streaked and the thunder bellowed 
far away. He shivered but kept go- 
ing down. When the water was up 
to his armpits his foot struck the 
first rung. He took a deep breath, 
closed his eyes and sank, running 
his hands along the concrete until 
they encountered the first rung. Af- 

154 



ter that he pulled himself down by 
the other rungs and, at the sixth, 
knew that the entrance was a few 
inches below it. He went under it 
and rose. His head popped up into 
air and light. A platform a few 
inches higher than the water was in 
front of him. Overhead was a 
dome, the highest point of which 
was ten feet. Beyond the platform 
was an exit. Six big electric light 
bulbs lit the chamber harshly. 

Shivering and gasping, he 
climbed onto the platform and 
strode to the exit. Joe followed him 
a moment later. He called weakly 
and Sam had to turn back and help 
him crawl onto the platform. He 
was bleeding from a dozen places. 

The others came after him, one 
by one. They helped Sam get the 
titanthrop through the exit and 
down an incline into a large cham- 
ber containing beds, towels, food, 
liquor, weapons and medicine. 
Sam had prepared this place for 
just such an emergency, but he had 
thought he was being foolishly cau^ 
tious. Only his most trusted 
lieutenants and the workers who 
had built this place knew about it. 
Joe and Cyrano had briefed the 
rest of the group. 

Another entrance, at the bottom 
of the dam, was hidden beneath the 
flow that powered the wheels con- 
nected to the generators. This one 
led to a shaft up which a man could 
climb, only to come to a seeming- 
ly blank wall. But the man who 
knew how could open that wall. 

The whole project was, he knew, 
a product of the romantic foolish- 
ness he had not entirely shed in this 
new life. The idea of secret doors 
under a waterfall and under the 

IF 




lake and of hidden apartments 
where he could rest and plan his 
revenge while his enemies hunted in 
vain for him continued irresistible. 
He had laughed at himself at times 
for having built the refuge. Now he 
was glad. Romanticism did have its 
uses. 

Also hidden was a detonator. All 
he had to do to set off the tons of 
dynamite inside the base of the 
dam was to connect two wires. The 
dam would go up and the water of 
the lake would roar out and carry 
the central part of Parolando out 
into The River. 

Sam Clemens and his Riverboat 
would also be destroyed — but that 
was the price. Sam did not like to 
think about it. 

T he wounded were treated and 
put under the sedation of 
dreamgum or liquor. Sometimes 
chewing the gum deadened pain; 
other times it seemed to increase it. 
The only way to neutralize its pain- 
expanding effects was to pour 
liquor into the patient. 

They ate and slept while the 
guards watched at both entrances. 
Joe Miller was semiconscious most 
of the time. Sam sat beside him 
and nursed him as best he could. 
Cyrano came back from his vigil at 
the door under the waterfall to 
report that it was night again 
outside. That was all he knew — he 
had seen or heard no one through 
the waterfall. 

Lothar and Sam were the least 
wounded. Sam . decided that they 
should sneak out past the waterfall 
exit and spy. Cyrano protested that 
he should go, too, but Sam re- 
fused. Livy did not say anything, 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



but she looked gratefully at Sam. 
He turned away; he did not want 
any thanks for sparing her mate. 

He wondered if Gwenafra were 
dead or captured. Lothar said that 
she had disappeared during the last 
attack. He had tried to get to her 
but had been driven back. He now 
felt ashamed of himself for not 
having done more. 

Sam and Lothar applied a dark 
stain all over their bodies and then 
went down the steel rungs of the 
shaft. The walls were damp and the 
rungs were slippery with moisture. 
Electric lights illuminated the 
shaft. 

They exited behind the waterfall, 
which roared and splashed at them. 
The ledge curved, following the 
lower half of the dam, until it ran 
out about twenty yards from the 
end. Here they climbed down steel 
rungs to the junction of the dam 
wall and the ground. From there 
they walked cautiously along a 
channel which had been cut put of 
the earth. Grass roots still stuck 
out of the dirt walls; the roots went 
deeper than any cuts made so 
far — it seemed impossible to kill 
the grass. 

The sky was bright with the jam- 
pack of huge stars and glowing gas 
clouds. Sam and Lothar were able 
to proceed swiftly in the silvered 
darkness. After a half a mile they 
moved at right angles to the canal, 
heading toward John's ruined pal- 
ace. 

Crouching in the shadows be- 
neath the outflung branches of an 
irontree, they looked down on the 
plains below. Men and women 
moved among the huts. The men 
were the victors, the women vic- 

155 




tims. Sam quivered when he heard 
screams and beggings, but he tried 
to push them out of his mind. To 
act rashly now would be to throw 
away his chances of doing any good 
for Parolando. 

Yet, if he heard Gwenafra’s 
voice, he knew that he would go to 
her rescue. 

The Tires in the open hearths and 
the smelters were again blazing and 
men and women were working in 
them. Evidently Hacking had al- 
ready put his slaves to work. 
Guards stood around the buildings. 

The plains Were well lit for as far 
as he could see with huge bonfires. 
The people around them seemed to 
be drinking and laughing. 
Occasionally a struggling and 
screaming woman was carried off 
into the shadows. ' 

S AM and Lothar walked down 
the hill as if they owned it, but 
they did not go near to the build- 
ings or the fires. 

Nobody challenged them, 
though they came within twenty 
yards of a number of patrols. Most 
of the enemy seemed to be 
celebrating the victory with purple 
passion or any other liquor they 
had been able to get from the sup- 
plies of their prisoners. The excep- 
tions were the Wahhabi Arabs, 
whose religion forbade drinking al- 
cohol. And some others apparent- 
ly were abstemious. These proba- 
bly were disciples of Hacking, who 
did not drink. 

Whatever the laxity now, disci- 
pline had been maintained during 
the day. The corpses had been tak- 
en away and a big stockade of poles 
removed from other buildings had 

156 



been set up at the foot of the hills. 
Sam surmised it held prisoners. 

He and Lothar strolled along, 
staggering now and th&n, as if 
drunk. They walked boldly be- 
tween a nitric acid factory and a 
waste-treatment building and out 
onto the plain. And stopped. Sam 
saw Firebrass — some twenty yards 
ahead — in a bamboo cage so nar- 
row that he could not sit down in 
it. His hands were tied tightly be- 
hind him. 

On a big X-frame of wood, up- 
side down, his legs tied to the up- 
per part of the X and his arms to 
the lower members, hung Goering. 

Sam looked around. A number 
of men, talking and drinking, stood 
in the big doorway of the waste- 
recycling plant. They did not say 
anything to Sam and Lothar, but 
they were looking at them. Sam 
detided not to go any closer or to 
try to talk to Firebrass. He longed 
to know why Hacking's emissary 
was in the cage, but he did not dare 
to ask him. What he had to do was 
find out all he could and then get 
back to the hideout inside the dam. 
So far, he thought, the situation 
looked hopeless. He could take his 
faithful and sneak out of the coun- 
try during the rains. He could blow 
up the dam and wash out every- 
thing, including the forces of Soul 
City — but he still did not want to 
lose the boat. He would let the dam 
alone for as long as he had a chance 
to get it back. 

His and Lothar’s slow and seem- 
ingly drunken wanderings took 
them near a big building that had 
been occupied by Fred Rolfe, King 
John’s supporter on the Council. 
The number of armed men on 

IF 




guard around it suggested to Sam 
that Hacking was inside. 

It was a one-story house of pine 
logs and bamboo. The windows 
were without shades and the lights 
showed people inside. 

Suddenly Lothar gripped Sam's 
arm and said, "There she is. Gwen- 
afra.” 

The light shone on her long hon- 
ey-color^ hair and pale skin. She 
stood near a window, talking to 
someone. After a moment she 
moved away and the bushy hair 
and black face of Elwood Hacking 
nioved across the bright square. 
Sam felt sick. Hacking seemed to 
have taken her for his woman for 
the night. 

Gwenafra had not looked fright- 
ened. She had seemed relaxed. 

Sam pulled Lothar away. 

""There's nothing we can do now 
and we could be throwing away any 
chance she might have at all if we 
started anything." 

They drifted around for a while, 
observing the other factories and 
noting that the bonfires stretched 
both ways along the walls as far as 
their eye could detect. In addition 
to the Soul Citizens, there were the 
Ulmaks and a number of Ori- 
entals. Sam wondered if these 
could be the Burmese, Thai, and 
Ceylonese New Stone Age peoples 
living across The River from Sel- 
inujo. 

He and Lothar had just passed 
into the shade of a gigantic iron- 
wood tree when Sam felt some- 
thing tighten around his neck from 
behind. He tried to yell, to turn 
around, to struggle, but the big 
hand squeezed and he lost con- 
sciousness. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



H e awoke gasping and 
coughing. He was still under 
the tree. He started to get up, but a 
deep voice growled, ‘"None o' that. 
Sit still, or I'll split yer skull." 

Sam looked around. Lothar, his 
hands tied behind him and a gag in 
his mouth, was sitting propped up 
under a half-grown fir sixty feet 
away. The man who had spoken 
was big, with excessively broad 
shoulders, a deep chest and brawny 
arms. He wore a black kilt and 
black cape and gripped medium- 
sized axe. His belt held a steel tom- 
ahawk, a steel knife and a Mark 1 
pistol. 

He asked, ‘‘You be Sam Clem- 
ens?" 

‘"That's right," Sam said. ""What 
does this mean? Who are you?" 

The big man jerked a head full of 
thick hair at Lothar. "I moved him 
away so he couldn't hear what we 
have to say. A man we both know 
sent me." 

Sam was silent for a moment, 
then asked, “The Mysterious 
Stranger?" 

The big man grunted. “Yes. 
That's what he said you called him. 
Stranger’s good enough. 1 guess 
you know what it’s all about, so 
there's not much use us jawing too 
long about it. You satisfied that 
I’ve talked with him?" 

“I have to be," Sam said. “It’s 
obvious that you’ve met him. 
You’re one of the Twelve he’s 
picked. It was a he, wasn’t it?" 

“I didn't jump him to find out," 
the man said. “I tell you, this child 
ain't ever run up against a human, 
red, black, or white, that ever 
threw a scare-fit into him. But that 
Stranger, he'd make a grizzly 

157 




scoot just by looking at him. Not 
that Vm afraid of him, you under- 
stand; it's just that he makes me 
feel — strange. Like I was a plucked 
bluejay. But enough of that. My 
handle's Johnston. Might as well 
give you my history and save jaw- 
ing later. John Johnston. 1 was 
born in New Jersey about eight- 
een-twenty-seven, 1 reckon, and 
died in Los Angeles in the veter- 
ans’ hospital in 1900. Between 
times, I was a trapper in the 
Rocky Mountains. Up to when I 
came to this River, I killed me 
hundreds of Injuns — but I ain't 
never had to kill a white man, not 
even a Frenchman. Not till 1 got 
here. Since then — well. I’ve col- 
lected quite a few white scalps.” 

The man stood up and moved 
out into the starlight. His* hair was 
dark but looked as if it would be a 
bright red in the noonday sun. 

“I talk a hell of a lot more’n I 
used to,” he said. “You can’t get 
away from people in this valley.” 

They walked over to Lothar. On 
the way Sam asked, “How’d you 
happen to get here? And at this 
time?” 

“The Stranger told me where to 
find you, told me about you, your 
boat, the Misty Tower and all that. 
Why hash it all over? You know. I 
promised to find you and go with 
you on your boat. Why not? I don’t 
like being set down here. There 
ain’t no elbow room; you can’t turn 
around without knocking noses. I 
was about thirty thousand miles 
upRiver when 1 woke up one night 
and there was that man sitting in 
the shadows. We had a long talk, 
him doing most of it. Then 1 got up 
and set out. I heard about some of 

158 



what was going- on here way up 
The River. I snuck in here while the 
fighting was still going on and I 
been looking for you ever since. I 
listened to them blacks talking; 
they said they couldn't find your 
body. So I been skulking around, 
seeing what I could see. Once 1 had 
to kill me one a those Ayrabs cause 
he stumbled across me. I was 
hungry, anyway.” 

They had reached Lothar, but 
Sam straightened up at the last 
words. 

“Hungry? You mean — ” 

The man did not reply. 

Sam said, “Say, uh, you — you 
wouldn’t be a man called ‘Liver 
Eating’ Johnston, would you? The 
Crow Killer?” 

The voice rumbled: “I made me 
peace with the Crows and became 
their brother. And 1 quit eating hu- 
man liver some time after. But a 
man has to eat.” 

S AM shivered. He stooped to 
untie Lothar’s bonds and re- 
moved the gag. Lothar was furi- 
ous, but he was also curious. And, 
like Sam, he seemed to find Johns- 
ton a little awing. The man exuded 
savage force. Without even half- 
trying, Sam thought. 

They walked back to the dam. 
Johnston did not say anything for a 
long time. Once he disappeared, 
leaving Sam feeling strange and 
cold. Johnston was about six and a 
half feet tall and looked as if he 
weighed two hundred and eighty 
pounds, all bone and muscle. But 
he moved like a tiger. 

Sam jumped. Johnston was 
back. Sam asked, “What hap- 
pened?” 



IF 




Johnston said, “Never mind. 
You say you didn’t get around 
much. I been all over this place; I 
know the sitchyation passing well. 
Lots a your people to the north and 
the south got away over the walls. 

If they’d a stood up, they might’ve 
licked the blacks. But the blacks 
ain’t won by a long shot. lyeyasu is 
getting ready to move against 
them. I wouldn’t be surprised none 
if he invades tonight. I scouted 
around his place some before I 
came here. He ain’t going to put up 
with the blacks owning all this iron 
and the boat. He will take it away 
from them or know why.” 

Sam groaned. It made no differ- 
ence whether Hacking or lyeyasu 
had the boat, if he couldn’t get it. 
But by the time they were inside the 
dam, he felt better. Maybe the two 
forces would destroy each other 
and the Parolandanoj who’d fled 
could come back and take over. 

Moreover, the appearance of the 
Herculean mountain man. Liver 
Eating Johnston, heartened Sam. 
The Mysterious Stranger had not 
entirely abandoned him. The 
Stranger was still planning — and 
he had sent a damn good man for 
Fighting, if the stories about Johns- 
ton could be believed. Johnston 
was the sixth man the Stranger had 
chosen. The other six would show 
up some time — though one had 
been lost. Odysseus had disap- 
peared. 

He^ could show up again. The 
River* was a great place for bad 
pennies, if you could call the 
Twelve that. They were bad for 
somebody. For the Stranger’s peo- 
ple, the Ethicals, Sam hoped. 

In the dam, Johnston had to be

introduced and the situation ex- 
plained. Joe Miller, wrapped in 
towels, sat up and shook hands 
with Johnston. And Johnston, awe 
in his voice, said, “Night and day, 
this, manrchild seed many queer 
things. But 1 ain’t never seed one 
like you. You didn’t have to crush 
my hand, friend.” 

“I didn’t try,” Joe said. “You 
look pretty big and thtroiig to me. 
Bethideih, I b^n thick.” 

They moved out about half an 
hour before the rains. The land was 
relatively quiet by then. The 
celebrators had gone to bed and 
everybody had cleared away from 
the Fires in expectation of the rain. 
But the guard towers and the fac- 
tories were full of enemy guards. 
They had stopped drinking. Appar- 
ently Hacking had called a halt to 
it. 

J OHNSTON, like a giant ghost, 
drifted away while they leaned 
against the side of the sulfuric acid 
factory. Ten minutes later he was 
suddenly beside them. 

“I been giving those blacks the 
ear,” he said. “That Hacking is 
smart. All that drinking and 
whooping it up and staggering 
around, why, that was all a put-on 
for the benefit of spies from lyeya- 
sujo. Hacking knows lyeyasujo is 
going to attack tonight and he’s 
making it look like it’s gonna be 
easy. But his men are worried. 
They’re short of gunpowder.” 

Sam was startled by the news. 
He asked Johnston if he had over- 
heard anything else. 

“Yeah. 1 heard a couple of them 
Citizens talking about why Hack- 
ing decided he had to attack us; He 

159 




knew lyeyasu was going to do it, so 
he decided he had to jump the gun. 
If he didn’t, lyeyasu would have 
control of the metal and the 
amphibians and would conquer 
Soul City next. Them jackasses 
was laughing fit to kill, they said it 
was King John arranged with 
Hacking to take over — And then 
Hacking blew up King John in his 
own house because he didn’t trust 
John.” 

Sam said, ’‘But why in hell 
would John do that to us? What did 
he have to gain?” 

‘‘Hacking and John was gonna 
conquer all the land for a hundred 
miles along The River and then 
split it. John was gonna rule the 
white half and Hacking the black 
half. Half and half, with the two 
sharing everything equah^They was 
gonna build two boats, two of ev^ 
erything.” 

‘‘What about Firebrass? Why’s 
he in the cage?” 

‘‘Dunno, but somebody did call 
him a traitor. And that kraut, 
what’s his name — Herring?” 

“Goering.” 

‘‘Yeah. Well, Hacking wasn’t to 
blame for his being tortured. Some 
of them Wahhabi Ayrabs did it. 
They’s got it in for the Second 
Chancers, you know, and they got 
him and tortured him with the help 
a some a them bad Dahomeyans, 
who used to torture a dozen people 
before breakfast, according to 
what I heard. By the time Hacking 
heard of it and stopped it, Goering 
was dying. But he talked to. 
Hacking, called him his soul 
brother and said he forgave him. 
Said he’d see him later along The 
River. Hacking was pretty shook 

160 



up about it, from what his men 
said.” 

Sam digested the news, which set 
his teeth on edge. He was so upset 
he couldn’t even get any amuse- 
ment from Hacking’s doublecross 
of the champion doublecrosser. 
King John. He did have to admire 
Hacking’s statesmanship and per- 
ception, however. Hacking had 
realized there was only one way to 
deal with John. 

J OHNSTON’S crucial data 
changed everything. Apparent- 
ly, lyeyasu was on the way now, 
which meant that Sam’s plans to 
sneak out during the rains would 
not work. 

“What’s the matter, Sam?” Livy 
said. She was sitting near him, 
looking sadly at him. 

“I think it’s all up with us.” 

“Oh, Sam — where’s your man- 
hood? It isn’t all up with us. You 
get depressed so easily if things 
don’t go your way all the time. 
Why, this is the greatest opportu- 
nity you could ask for to get your 
boat back. Let Hacking and lyeya- 
su destroy each other and then take 
over. Just sit back up in the hills 
until they have clawed each other 
to death and jump on them while 
they’re gasping out their last.” 

Sam said, angrily, “What are 
you talking about? Jump on them 
with fifteen men and women?” 

“No. You have at least five hun- 
dred prisoners in that stockade and 
God knows how many more in 
other stockades. And you have 
thousands who ran away to Cern- 
skujo and Publiujo.” 

“How can I get hold of them 
now?” Sam said. “It’s too late! The 



IF 




attack will be launched in a few 
hours/ Besides, the refugees were 
probably put in stockades, too. For 
all I know, Chernsky and Publius 
Crassus may be in cahoots with 
Hacking.” 

“You’re still the same paralyzed 
pessimist I knew on Earth,” Livy 
said. “Oh, Sam, I still love you, in 
a way, that is. I still like you as a 
friend and — ” 

“Friend!” he said so loudly that 
the others jumped. 

Cyrano swore and Johnston 
hissed, “Shet up. You want them 
black Injuns to get us?” 

“We were lovers for years,” he 
said. 

“Not always, by a long shot,” 
she said. “But this is no place for a 
discussion of our failures. I don’t 
intend to thrash those out — it’s too 
late. The point is* do you or do you 
not want your boat?” 

“Of course, I want it,” he said 
fiercely. 

“Then get off your dead ass, 
Sam!” she said. 

From anybody else, the remark 
would have been unremarkable. 
But from her, his fragile, soft- 
voiced, clean-speeched Livy, it was 
unthinkable. But she had said it 
and now that he thought back on it 
there had been times on Earth, 
which he had suppressed in his 
memory, when . 

“The lady makes a powerful lot 
a sense!” Johnston rumbled. 

He had far more important 
things to think about. But the real- 
ly important matters were best rec- 
ognized by the unconscious — and 
for the first time he understood, 
really understood with every cell of 
his body that Livy had changed. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



She was no longer his Livy. She 
had not been for a long time, per- 
haps had not been for some years 
on Earth before her death. 

“What do you say, Mr. Clem- 
ens?” the mountain man rumbled 
Sam gave a deep sigh, as if he 
were breathing out the last frag- 
ments of Olivia Langdon Clemens 
de Bergerac. 

He said, “Here’s what we do.” 

T he rains lashed down; thunder 
and lightning made the skies 
and the land hideous for a half 
hour. Johnston appeared out of the 
rain with two bazookas and four 
rockets tied together on his broad 
back. He disappeared again and a 
half hour later was back with some 
throwing knives and tomahawks, 
all of steel. 

The rain clouds went away and 
the land was brightly silver under 
the magnificent stars, as numer- 
ous as cherries on a tree in season, 
as luminous as jewels before elec- 
tric lights. The air grew colder and 
Sam’s people shivered under the 
irontree. A thin mist formed over 
The River; within fifteen minutes, 
it was so thick that the waters and 
the grailstones and the high walls 
along the banks could not seen. 

lyeyasu struck a half-hour later. 
The big boats and the small boats, 
crammed with men and weapons, 
came from across The River, where 
the Sacs and Foxes had once ruled, 
from the northern part of the ex- 
Ulmak territory, from the land 
where the Hottentots and Bushmen 
had once lived in peace. And the 
main bulk came from the right 
bank of The River, from the three 
lands where lyeyasu now was lord. 

161 




lyeyasu attacked at ten points 
along the Riverfront walls. Mines 
blew up the walls, and men pourtxl 
through the breaches. The number 
of rockets shot in the first ten min- 
utes was awesome. lyeyasu must 
have been saving them for a long 
time. The three amphibians of the 
defenders lumbered up, their steam 
machine guns chuffing and expel- 
ling the .75 caliber shells in garden 
hose fashion. The carnage they 
made was great, but lyeyasu 
launched a surprise. Rockets with 
wooden warheads containing jel- 
lied alcohol (made from soap plus 
wood alcohol) struck all around the 
three armored vehicles and made 
clirect hits at least twice each. The 
crude napalm spread fierily over 
the vehicles, and if the burning 
stuff did not get inside the-vehicles, 
it seared the lungs of the men 
inside. 

Sam was shaken by the sight, but 
not enough to keep him from 
telling Lothar to remind him of this 
when it was all over — if either of 
them were still around. 

“The amphibians have to be 
made more airtight and we’ll have 
to install a self-contained air sys- 
tem,” he said. 

Johnston appeared, as unexpect- 
edly as if he had stepped out of a 
door in the night — and behind him 
was Firebrass. The man looked ex- 
hausted and as if he were in pain, 
but he still managed to grin at 
Sam. He was, however, trembling. 

“Hacking was told that I was 
betraying him,” Firebrass said. 
“And he' believed his informant. 
Who was, by the way, your es- 
teemed and always reliable King 
John. John told him that I was 



selling him down The River, that I 
had revealed everything to you so I 
could become chief of your air 
force. Hackii^ would not believe 
that I was dickering with you just 
to string you along. I can’t blame 
him too much. I should have sent 
word through our spies what I wais 
doing. That I didn’t convince him 
that I wasn’t doublecrossing him 
didn’t surprise me.” 

“Were you?” Sam said. 

Firebrass grinned. “No, I 
wasn’t, though I was mightily 
tempted. But why should I betray 
him when I’d been promised I 
could be head flier after Hacking 
took over the boat? The truth is. 
Hacking was eager to believe 
John. He doesn’t like me because 
I’m not his idea of what a soul 
brother should be, I had too easy a 
life according to him. He re- 
sented the fact that I never lived in 
a ghetto.” 

“The job of chief engineer can 
still be yours,” Sam said. “I’ll ad- 
mit that I’m relieved about not 
having to promise you the cap- 
taincy of the air force. But you can 
still fly, if you want to.” 

“That’s the best offer I’ve had 
since I died,” Firebrass said. “I’ll 
take it.” 

He moved closer to Sam and 
whispered in his ear. “You would 
have had to take me along in some 
capacity anyway. I’m one of The 
Twelve!” 

S AM felt as if a cold rod had 
been plunged through him from 
the top of his head down. 

“The Ethical? The Stranger?” 
“Yes. He said you called him 
The Mysterious Stranger.”

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 163 




Enormous chunks of concrete flew 
through the smoke like white birds 
above a factory chimney. They 
tumbled over and over and struck 
the ground far ahead of the waters. 
The lake was no longer the 
peaceful and quiet glimmer of a 
wonderful world to come. It 
seemed to hurl itself forward. The 
roar as it raced down the canyon 
Sam’s men had dug with so much 
sweat and time was deafening, 

T he water, hundreds of thou- 
sands of tons of it, funneled by 
the .canyon, rammed through the 
earthen walls, tearing out great 
chunks of it. The sudden drop of 
the water level also removed a 
great amount of earth around the 
lake’s shores, so much so. that the 
watchers had to scramble-for even 
higher ground. And the thousand- 
foot irontree, its two-hundred-foot 
roots abruptly exposed, toppled 
over. 

It seemed to take a long time 
falling and the explosions of enor- 
mous roots breaking and the whist- 
ling of air through the huge leaves 
and vines terrified the humans. 
They had thought they were far 
enough away, but even though the 
giant tree was falling away from 
them, they were threatened by the 
eruption of roots from the earth. 

The tree struck with a crash on 
the other side of the lake, tore out 
overhanging dirt and continued on 
down into the emptying lake. It slid 
put entirely from its root-anchors 
on the bank. The waters picked up 
the enormous tree as if it were a 
toothpick and carried it down the 
canyon for a half-mile before it 
became wedged. 

164 



The water roared out in a wall at 
least a hundred feet high. Its front 
carried a tangle of half-grown trees 
and bamboo plants, huts, people, 
and debris. It flashed across the 
mile and a half of plam, spreading 
out but channeled, for a few min- 
utes, by the secondary walls Sam 
had built to defend the factories 
and the River boat. 

Everything was picked up and 
carried on out into The River. The 
factories crumbled as if they were 
made of straw. The gigantic River- 
boat was lifted up like a toy boat 
cast into the ocean surf. It rode out 
into The- River, pitching, and 
vanished in darkness and turmoil. 
The sight made Sam throw himself 
on the ground and claw at the 
grass. His boat was lost! All he had 
made was lost, factories, mines, 
amphibians, airplanes, smithies, 
armories — but worst of all, the 
Riverboat was lost. The dream 
was shattered, the great shining 
jewel of his dream had been 
smashed. 

The grass was cold and wet in his 
face. Joe’s huge hand lifted him up 
and sat him down, as if he were a 
dummy. Joe’s monstrous hairy 
body was pressed close to his, 
warming him. And Joe’s gro- 
tesque face with the shelving 
brows and the absurdly long nose 
was before him. 

‘‘They’re all gone,” Joe said.- 
‘‘Chethuth! Vhat a thight— there 
ain’t nothing left, Tham!” 

The plain was buried under a 
whirl and toss of waters, but in fif- 
teen minutes The River had re- 
sumed its normal appearance along 
the shores of Parolando, though it 
surely was swollen downstream. 

IF 




The great buildings and the boat 
in its scaffoldings were gone. The 
Cyclopean walls on the sides, a mile 
apart, were gone. Small ponds glit- 
tered here. and there where the 
mines and the basements of the 
factories had been. The vast weight 
of water had gouged out part of 
the plain. The stone and earth 
walls along the banks had been 
swept away as if they were sand. 

The skies paled, and the starlit 
darkness became gray. The great 
fleet of the invaders was gone far 
down The River, or under it, bro- 
ken, smashed. The two armies on 
the plain and the sailors were all 
dead, crushed by the weight of the 
water, browned, rubbed into noth- 
ing or squeezed out like tooth- 
paste. 

But Parolando extended for ten 
miles along The River, and the lake 
had, after all, only raged across a 
two-mile area. Its main damage 
had been in the middle of 
Parolando, where it had carried 
everything out that stood within a 
half a mile wide area. 

Dawn brought with it a thousand 
men in boats or over the walls of 
Chernsky’s Land from the north. 

At their head was King John,

center, but King John limped for-

to him, Sam expected eventually to 
be killed, but he realized that right 
now John needed him and Fire- 
brass and others if he were going 
to get the boat rebuilt. Also, he 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBQAT 



banked on John’s wanting the per- 
verted pleasure of keeping Sam 
alive — and wondering when the 
dagger in the night would Find 
him. 

As it turned out, not everything 
had to be started from scratch 
again. The boat was found 
relatively undamaged, beachdd on 
a hill across The River a mile 
down. It had been deposited as 
gently as a cat’s footstep by the 
withdrawing waters. The work of 
getting the great hull back was not 
easy; but it took much less time 
than making another one. 

John explained more than once 
to Sam what he had done, but the 
deviousnesses and the two times 
two doublecrosses were so com- 
plicated that Sam could never* see 
the picture as a whole. John had 
made a deal to betray Sam, know- 
ing full well that Hacking would 
betray him in return. John would 
have been disappointed if 
Hacking had not tried to stab him 
in the back. He would have lost all 
his faith in human nature. 

John had made a deal with lye- 
yasu to help him invade after 
Hacking’s invasion, lyeyasu liked 
the idea that Hacking would 
weaken his forces while taking 
Parolando. At the last moment, 
John had made a deal with Publius 
Crassus, Tai Fung, and Chernsky 
that they would help him mop up 
on lyeyasu’s forces, which would 
be shattered by the waters re- 
leased by the blown-up dam. 

John had sent the three men to 
set off the explosives in the dam 
when the greatest number of in- 
vaders and defenders would be 
concentrated between the fun- 

165 




neling secondary-defense walls. 

“Then you weren’t in yoiir pal- 
ace when Hacking’s cannons 
opened up on it?” Sam said. 

“No,” John replied, smiling his 
cat’s smile. “I was miles to the 
north, traveling to meet lyeyasu. 
You have never thought much of 
me, Samuel^ but you should get 
down on your knees now and kiss 
my hand in gratitude. Without 
me you would have lost all.” 

“If you had told me Hacking 
was going to invade, 1 could have 
kept everything,” Sam said. “We 
could have ambushed Hacking.” 
The sun came up and struck the 
tawniness in John’s hair and the pe- 
culiar gray-blue of his eyes. “Ah, 
yes, but lyeyasu would still have 
been a formidable problem. Now 
he’s gone, and there rs* Httle to 
keep us from ruling all the land we 
need, including the bauxite and 
platinum of Soul City and the 
iridium and- tungsten of Selinujo. 
I presume you have no objec- 
tions to conquering those two 
states?” 

T here was a bonanza in the af- 
termath. Hacking was taken 
prisoner and Gwenafra was found 
alive. Both had been pushed during 
the Fighting into the hills to the 
west. Hacking had been getting 
ready to lead a fresh charge against 
lyeyasu when the edge of the wa- 
ters deluged his party, Gwenafra 
escaped, though she almost 
drowned. Hacking had been hurled 
against a tree. Both his legs and 
one arm were broken and he was 
bleeding internally. 

Sam and John hastened to where 
Hacking lay under an irontree.

Gwenafra cried when she saw 
them and embraced Sam and 
Lothar. She seemed to give Sam a 
much longer embrace than she 
gave Lothar, which was not en- 
tirely unexpected, since she and 
Lothar had been quarreling vi- 
olently before her capture. 

John wanted to finish off Hack- 
ing with-^ome refined tortures, 
preferably as soon after breakfast 
as possible. Sam objected 
strongly. He knew that John could 
have his way if he insisted, since his 
men outnumbered Sam’s by fifty 
to one. But Sam was past being 
cautious and John backed away. 
He needed Sam and Sam’s men. 

“You had a dream, Sam,” 
, Hacking said in a weak voice. 
“Well, I had one, too. A land 
where brothers and sisters could 
loaf and invite their souls. Where 
we’d be all black. You wouldn’t 
know what that means. No white 
devils, no white-eyes. Just black 
soul brothers. A place like that 
would have been as near heaven as 
you can get in this hell of a world. 
Not that we wouldn’t have had 
trouble, no place without trouble, 
man. But there wouldn’t have been 
any white-man trouble. Life would 
have been ours. But that isn’t to 
be.” 

“You could have had your 
dream,” Sam said, “if you’d 
waited. After the boat was built, 
we’d have left the iron to whoever 
could take it. And then — ” 

Hacking grimaced. Sweat cov- 
ered him and his face was tight 
with pain. “Man, you must be out 
of your skull. You really think I be- 
lieved that story about you sailing

I dont get it, Tham, Joe had 
said. 

Sam had given up. 

The twenty-sixth anniversary of 
Resurrection Day was the day the 
sidewheeler Not For Hire first 
turned its paddles. The big mo- 
ment came about an hour after the 
grailstones flamed to charge the 
breakfast grails. The cables and 
cap connected to the grailstone 
had been removed and the cables 
wound up within the hold through 
a port in the forward section on 
the starboard side. The grails had 
been removed from the stone a 
mile north and rushed to the big 
boat in the amphibious, ar- 
mored, steam-driven launch, the 
Post No Bills, The fabulous River- 
boat, gleaming white with red, 
black and green trimmings, moved 
out from the canal and into The 
River behind a huge breakwater 
on its starboard side. 

Whistles blowing, iron bells 
clanging, passengers cheering, 
people on the shore shouting, the 
magnificent paddlewheels churn- 
ing. Not For Hire moved with 
stately grace out into The River. 

T he Riverboat had an overall 
length of four hundred and for- 
ty feet and six inches. The beam 
over the paddlewheel guards was 
ninety-three feet. The mean draft, 
loaded, was twelve feet. The giant 
electric motors driving the pad- 
dle-wheels delivered ten thousand 
shaft horse power. Top speed, 
theoretically, was forty-five 
miles an hour in still water. Going 
upstream against the fifteen-mile- 
an-hour current, it would be 
thirty. Going downstream, it 

168 



would be sixty. The boat would be 
going up The River most of the 
time and cruising at fifteen miles 
an hour relative to the ground. 

There were four decks, the so- 
called boiler deck, the main deck, 
the hurricane deck and the landing 
deck. The pilothouse was at the 
fore edge of the hurricane deck 
and the lopg texas, containing 
the captain’s and chief officers’ 
quarters, was behind the pilot- 
house. However, the pilothouse- 
was itself double-deck^. It was 
set forward of the two tall but thin 
smokestacks, which rose thirty 
feet high. Firebrass had advised 
against the stacks, because the 
smoke from the big boilers (used 
only to heat water and to drive the 
machine guns) could be piped out 
on the side. But Sam had snorted 
and said, “What do I care about air 
resistance? I want beauty! And 
beauty is what we’ll get! Whoever 
heard of a Riverboat without 
tall, graceful impressive smoke- 
stacks! Have you no soul, broth- 
er?’’ 

There were sixty-five cabins, 
each about twelve by twelve with 
snap-up beds and tables and fold- 
ing chairs. Each cabin had a toilet 
and a wash basin with hot and cold 
running water and there was a 
shower for every six cabins. 

There were three big lounges, 
one in the texas, one on the hurri- 
cane deck, and one on the main 
deck. These held pool tables, dart 
games, gymnastic equipment, 
card tables, a movie screen, a 
stage for dramas or -musicals and 
the main deck lounge held a podi- 
um for the orchestra. 

The upper deck of the pilot- 

IF 




house was luxuriously furnished 
with carved oak chairs and tables 
covered with red Riverdra^on 
fish leather. The pilot sat in a 
large and comfortable swivel 
chair before the instrument 
board. On this was a bank of small 
closed-circuit TV screens, giving 
him views of the control centers 
of the boat. Before him was a 
microphone Which enabled him to 
speak to anybody on the boat. He 
controlled the boat with two lev- 
ers on a small movable board be- 
fore him. The left stick controlled 
the port wheel; the right, the star- 
board. A screen before him was a 
radar indicator used at night. 
Another screen showed him the 
depth of the water from the bot- 
tom of the boat as measured by 
sonar. A toggle on the instru- 
ment board could switch the pilot- 
ing to automatic, though the rule 
was that a pilot had to be on duty 
at all times. 

Sam was dressed in bleached 
fish-leather sandals, a white kilt, a 
white cape and a white officer’s 
cap of plastic and leather. He 
wore a bleached leather belt and 
holster for a ponderous Mark II 
.69 four-shooter pistol and a 
sheath for a rapier. 

He paced back and forth, a big 
green cigar in his mouth, and 
watched the pilot, Robert Styles, 
steering the boat for the first time. 
Styles was an old Mississippi pi- 
lot, a handsome youth, no liar, 
though given to inflating facts. 
Sam had been overcome with joy 
when he had appeared about two 
years before. He had known Rob 
Styles when they were both Mis- 
sissippi pilots. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



S tyles was nervous, as any- 
body would be the first time, 
even the steel-nerved Captain Isa- 
iah Sellers of ancient Mississippi 
fame. There was nothing to pilot- 
ing the boat — a one-ey^ Sunday 
School teacher with a hangover 
could do it, his six-year-old child 
could do it, once he got the hang of 
the two sticks. Push 'forward for 
increased speed, put in the middle 
position to stop the wheels, pull 
back to reverse the wheels. To steer 
the boat to port, pull back a little 
on the port stick and forward a lit- 
tle on the starboard stick. To steer 
to starboard, do the reverse. 

But it took: some practice before 
the proper coordination was 
achieved. 

Luckily there was no memory 
work involved in piloting a boat on 
this River. There were no islands, 
no sand bars, and there would be 
few logs with snags. An alarm bell 
rang before the boat worked too 
close to shallow water. At night 
radar or sonar would indicate ob- 
structions and activate a red light. 

Sam watched Styles for a half- 
hour, then took over the piloting 
and, after another half-hour, asked 
John if he would like to try. John 
was dressed entirely in black, as if 
he were determined to do just the 
opposite of whatever Sam did. 
But he took the sticks and did well 
for an ex-king who had never done 
a lick of worL in his life and had al- 
ways let inferiors do whatever 
steering was necessary. 

The boat sailed up past the dead 
lyeyasu’s kingdom, now split into 
three states again. Then Sam or- 
dered the vessel turned back. Rob 
Styles got fancy and pivoted her 

169 




a dime — ” as he said, to 
demonstrate her maneuvera- 
bility. While the port wheel backed 
the starboard raced forward at 
full speed. The boat rotated as if 
stuck on a pin, then headed down- 
stream. With the current and wind 
behind her and the paddlewheels 
turning at maximum speed, the 
No( For Hire raced along at sixty 
miles an hour. Sam had Styles 
bring her in close to the shore, 
where the sonar indicated about 
one foot of clearance between 
hull and bottom on the port side. 
Even above the slapping of the 
wheels and the splashing of water 
and the whistling and clanging of 
bells, they could hear the crowds. 
The faces whizzed by as if in a 
dream. 

Sam opened the fore portyof the 
pilothouse to feel the wind and 
heighten the impression of speed. 

The Not For Hire raced all the 
way downstream to Selinujo, then 
turned again. Sam wished, almost, 
that there were another boat that 
he could race against. But it was 
heaven enough to have the only 
metal electrically powered Riv- 
erboaf in existence. A man 
couldn't have everything, not even 
in the after- Earthlife. 

D uring the return trip the 
huge hatch in the stern was 
lowered and the launch slipped in- 
to The River. It cut back and forth 
at top speed and raced ahead of the 
mother boat. Its steam machine 
guns traced lines along the water 
and the thirty steam guns on the 
Not For Hire shot back, though 
not at the launch. 

The big three-place amphibian- 

170 



monoplane came out of the open- 
ing in the stern, too. Its wings were 
straightened out and locked and it 
took off. Firebrass was at the con- 
trols. His woman and Gwenafra 
were passengers. 

A moment later the tiny one- 
seater open-cockpit scout-fighter 
was shot off the top of the texas by 
a steam catapult. Lothar von 
Richthofen took it up, wood- 
alcohol motor buzzing, and 
raced ahead until he was out of 
sight. He returned, climbed and 
entertained with the first aerial 
acrobatics that the Riverworld 
had ever seen — to the best of Sam's 
knowledge. 

Lothar concluded with a dive, at 
the end of which he fired four rock- 
ets and then the twin machine 
guns. These were .80 caliber and 
fired aluminum bullets from alu- 
minum cartridges. There were 
one hundred thousand of these 
stored on the boat. When they were 
used up there would be no more. 

Lothar landed the tiny mono- 
plane on the landing deck on top of 
the texas and devices caught the 
hook trailed out by the plane. Even 
so, the whirling propeller stopped 
only ten feet from the smoke- 
stacks. Firebrass returned in the 
amphibian and later took the 
wheeled plane up for a flight. 

Sam looked down through the 
port front at the marines drilling on 
the fore part of the broad boiler 
deck. They marched back and 
forth and performed intricate 
maneuvers under Cyrano's 
orders. Their silvery duralumin 
plumed helmets were like those of 
the ancient Romans. They wore

along the bank and pressed a but- 
ton that set off a series of steam 
whistles and clanging bells. 

He drew in smoke from his fine 
cigar, stuck out his chest and 
paraded back and forth. Strube- 
well handed John a glass full of 
bourbon and then he offered Sam 
one. Everybody in the pilot- 
house, Styles, the six other pilots, 
Joe Miller, von Richthofen, 
Firebrass, Publius Crassus, Mo- 
zart, John Lackland, Strubewell 
and three other aides of John took 
a glass. 

“A toast, gentlemen,” John said 
in Esperanto. “To a long and hap- 
py journey and may we all get what 
we deserve.” 

J OE MILLER, standing near 
Sam, the top of his head^lmost 
touching the ceiling, held a glass 
containing about half a quart of 
bourbon. He sniffed at the amber 
liquor with his monstrous pro- 
boscis and then tasted it with the 
tip of his tongue. 

Sam had been just about to toss 
down the four-ounce drink when he 
saw Joe’s apish face grimace. 
“What’s the matter, Joe?” 

“Thith thtuff hath thomething in 
it.” 

Sam sniffed and could detect 
nothing but the most excellent of 
Kentucky’s best. 

But when John and Strubewell 
and the others reached for their 
weapons he threw the liquor in 
John’s face. 

Yelling, “It’s poison — ” he dived 
for the floor. 

Strubewell’s Mark II pistol 
boomed. The plastic bullet shat- 
tered against the bulletproof plas- 

172 



tic of the port above Sam’s head. 

Joe roared — he sounded like a 
lion suddenly released from its 
cage — and threw his liquor into 
Strubewell’s eyes. 

The other aides fired and fired 
again. The Mark II pistols were 
four-shot revolvers. The powder in 
the aluminum cartridges was 
electrically ignited. They were 
larger and heavier than the Mark 
I’s, but they could fired more swift- 
ly and cordite, not black gun- 
powder, propelled the plastic bul- 
lets. 

The pilothouse became a fury of 
booming, deafening explosives, the 
scream of shattered plastic rico- 
cheting, the shouts and screams of 
men and the subhuman bellowing 
of Joe. 

Sam rolled over, reached up and 
flicked the automatic pilot switch. 
Rob Styles was on the floor, his 
arm almost torn off. One of John’s 
aides was dying in front of him. 
Strubewell went flying over him 
and banged against the glass and 
then fell on him. John was gone; he 
had fled down the ladder. 

Sam crawled out from under 
Strubewell. Four of his pilots were 
dead. All of the aides, except for 
Strubewell, who was only uncon- 
scious, were dead. Their necks had 
been broken or their jaws shat- 
tered by Joe. Mozart crouched, 
quivering, in a corner. Firebrass 
bled from cuts made by plas- 
tic fragments and Lothar from a 
gash in his arm. One of the aides 
had struck him with a knife just be- 
fore Joe twisted his head 180 de- 
grees. 

Sam rose shakily and looked 
through the port. The crowd on the 

IF 




deck had dispersed, but not with- 
out leaving a dozen bodies behind. 
The marines were firing at men 
shooting at them from around the 
sides of the main deck. Some of the 
fire seemed to be coming from 
cabin ports in the main deck. 

Cyrano stood with his rapidly 
dwindling crew, shouting orders. 
Then John’s men charged, firing. 
Cyrano went down. He was up 
again instantly, his sword flashing 
silver, then red. The enemy broke 
and ran. 

Cyrano ran after them. 

Sam shouted, ’’You fool — go 
back — ” but he was hot heard, of 
course. 



H e tried to struggle out of 
his shock. John had slipped 
something into their drinks, a poi- 
son or a sedative. Only Joe’s sub- 
humanly sensitive nose had saved 
Sam’s people from drinking and 
allowing John to take over the pi- 
lothouse with little trouble. 

Sam looked out and ahead. On- 
ly a half-mile away was the huge 
breakwater behind which the boat 
was to anchor for the night. The 
long journey would officially begin 
tomorrow. 

He flicked off the automatic pi- 
lot toggle switch and took the con- 
trol sticks in his hands. 

”Joe,” he said, ”I’m going to run 
this right up alongside the bank. 1 
may even ground us. Get out the 
bullhorn. I’ll tell the people 
ashore what’s happened and we'll 
get help.” 

He pulled back on the starboard 
stick and advanced the port stick. 
’’What’s happening?” he yelled. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



The boat was proceeding 
straight on its course up The Riv- 
er, holding to a distance of about 
a hundred yards off the shore. 

He moved the sticks back and 
forth, frantically, but the boat did 
not deviate. 

A voice came from the inter- 
com, John’s. 

”It’s no use, Samuel, Boss, Cap- 
tain, swine! 1 have control of the 
boat. My engineer, the man who 
will be chief engineer, put in a 
duplicate set of controls in — never 
mind where. I have cut off your 
controls, and the boat will go 
where I want it to. So you don’t 
have any advantage at all. Now 
my men will storm the pilothouse 
and take you. But I would prefer 
that there be as little damage as 
possible. So, if you will just get off 
the boat 1 will let you go un- 
harmed. Provided, that is, that 
you can swim a hundred yards.” 

Sam raged and swore and 
pounded his fists on the instru- 
ment panel. But the boat contin- 
ued past the dock, while the 
crowds gathered there waved, 
cheered and wondered. 

Lothar said, ’’They’re trying to 
sneak up on us — ” and fired at a 
man who had appeared around the 
far end of the texas on the hurri- 
cane deck. 

”We can’t hold out long,” Fire- 
brass said. ”We don’t have much 
ammunition.” 

Sam saw some men and women 
on the boiler deck; they were try- 
ing to make a stand. 

Livy was among them. 

She was firing a Mark II. 

John’s men charged. A man 
thrust at Cyrano, who was en- 

173 




gaged in running his rapier 
through the man next to him. Livy 
tried to knock the blade aside with 
her pistol and the sword went into 
her stomach. She fell, the sword 
still sticking out of her. The man 
who had killed her died a second 
later — Cyrano’s rapier went 
through his throat. 

Sam cried, “Livy! Livy!” 

He was out of the pilothouse and 
running down the ladder. Bullets 
screamed past him, smashed 
against the bulkheads and the lad- 
der. He felt a stinging, then heard 
a shouting behind him, but he did 
not stop. He was vaguely aware 
that Joe Miller and the others had 
runout after him. 

Corpses and wounded were 
everywhere. The boat was turning 
into shore, its paddlewheels 
operating at full speed, the water 
flying, the wheels chuff-chuffing, 
the deck trembling. John was 
turning the boat into shore and 
Sam saw why. A number of 
heavily armed men and women 
had been posted at this section of 
The Riverbank. They would be 
the disaffected, Sam guessed, re- 
cruited from among the people 
who were angered because the 
lottery had cut them out of a place 
on the crew. John had mobilized 
them. Once they got aboard, they 
would mop up whatever resistance 
they met. 



S AM had run along the hurri- 
cane deck after leaving the pi- 
lothouse ladder. He gripped a pis- 
tol with two shots left in it in one 
hand and his rapier in the other. He 
did not know how they had gotten 

174 



into his hands; he had no memory 
of having drawn either. 

A face appeared at the edge of 
the deck. He fired and it dropped. 
He was on the edge of the deck 
then and shooting even as he leaned 
over to look down the ladder. 
Sam’s bullet did not miss this 
time. The man’s chest erupted red 
and he fell down the ladder, tak- 
ing two companions with him. 
But others on the deck below 
raised their pistols and he had to 
jump back. The volley missed him. 

Joe Miller said behind him, 
“Tham! Tham! There’th nothing 
to do but chump overboard! They 
got uth thurrounded.” 

Below, Cyrano, still wielding his 
rapier, holding off three men at one 
time, backed to the railing. His 
blade pierced a throat, the man fell 
and Cyrano whirled and leaped 
over the railing. When he came up 
he began to swim strongly to get 
away from the starboard paddle- 
wheel thrashing toward him. 

Bullets struck the sides of the 
cabins behind Sam, and Lothar 
cried, “Jump, Sam! Jump!” 

Joe had already turned and was 
running with his great axe toward 
the men firing from behind the rear 
of the cabins along the hurricane 
deck. Bullets streaked toward him, 
but he was depending upon his ter- 
rifying aspect and his prowess, 
which they well knew, to panic the 
shooters. 

Sam and Lothar ran behind him 
until they came to the paddlewheel 
housing, some ten feet from the 
edge of the hurricane deck. If they 
stood up on the railing and leaped 
out, they could grab hold of the big 
iron eyes through which cables had 



IF 




been secured when the housing had 
been placed over the wheel by the 
crane. 

They jumped, one after the oth- 
er, while bullets screamed by. Each 
grabbed an eye, pulled himself to 
the top of the housing and hit the 
water from there. The water was 
thirty feet below, a height which 
would have made Sam hesitate un- 
der different conditions. This time, 
he went out, fell straight, holding 
his nose, and plunged into the wa- 
ter feet first. 

Sam dove. Several of the steam 
machine guns had been depressed 
and .75 caliber bullets were prob- 
ing for him. 



J OHN’S voice boomed from a 
bullhorn: “Farewell, Sam! 
Thanks for building the Riverboat 
for me — I’ll change its name to one 
that’ll suit me better! I’m going, 
to enjoy the fruits of your la- 
bors— think of me as often as you 
please. Farewell!” 

His laughter blasted Sam’s ears. 
Sam came out of his hiding place 
in a hut and climbed the wall on the 
edge of the water. The boat had 
stopped and let down a long gang- 
plank on cables to permit the 
traitors to come aboard. He heard 
a voice below him and looked 
down. There was Joe, his reddish 
hairs black with water except 
where blood streaked it. 

“Lothar and Firebrath and Thy- 
rano and Chohnthton made it,” he 
said. 

“How you feel, Tham?” 

Sam sat down on the hard- 
packed dirt and said, “If it would 
do any good. I’d kill myself. This 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



world is hell, Joe, genuine hell. 
You can’t even commit a decent 
suicide. You wake up the next day 
and there you are with your prolv 
lems stuck on you with gluo.” 

“Vhat do ve do now, Tham?” 

Sam did not reply for a long 
time. If he couldn’t have Livy, Cyr- 
ano would not have her, either. He 
could endure the thought of having 
lost her if she was not where he 
could see her. 

Later, the shame at exulting in 
Cyrano’s loss would come. 

Not now. He was too stunned. 
The loss of the boat had been even 
a greater shock than seeing Livy 
killed. 

After all these years of liard 
work, of grief, of betrayal, of plan- 
ning, of hurting, of — of— 

It was too much to bear. 

Joe was grieved to see him cry, 
but he sat patiently by until Sam’s 
tears had quit flowing. 

Then he asked, “Do ve thtart 
building another boat, Tham?” 

Sam Clemens rose to his feet. 
The gangplank was being drawn up 
by the electromechanical machine- 
ry of his fabulous Riverboat. 
Whistles were shrilling exultant- 
ly and bells were clanging. John 
would still be laughing. He might 
even be watching Sam through a 
telescope. 

Sam shook his fist, hoping that 
John was watching him. 

“I’ll get you yet!” he howled. 
“I’ll build another boat and I’ll 
catch up with you. I’ll run you 
down, John, and I’ll blast your 
stolen boat out of The River. No- 
body, the Stranger, or his kind, no 
matter what their powers, is go- 
ing to stop me!” •
