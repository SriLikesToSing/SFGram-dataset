Always look gift horses in the mouth — you never know if 

if you wish 






they’re the Trojan variety! 
By JOHN RACKHAM 



J ACOB O’SIMON pressed 
his nose to the sliding 
magnifier, staring through it 
and the glassite wall at the 
tense scene inside the hot- 
house. The hideous but excep- 





tionally rare and delicate 
Venusian fungus was about to 
spore. Any second now and — 
ideally — the bloated nodules 
would split to spew out a host 
of tiny purple balls. Ideally! 

He snatched a hasty glance 
at the strip panel by the side 
of the chamber, checking- 
temperature and humidity, 
atmosphere analysis — and 
was aware, suddenly, that the 
alarm was clamoring. That 
triple ring and pause, triple 
ring and pause, spelled out 
the approach of the shuttle 
rocket 

‘The hell with it!^^ he mut- 
tered, pressing his nose to the 
glass again. This sporulation 
he had to see with his own 
eyes. As he held his breath 
the nodules shivered visibly. 
Then the deep purple rinds 
burst, and a soggy gray mass 
dripped and splattered onto 
the hot, moist soil, to discolor 
and wither almost at once. 

He sighed and moved to 
switch the interior to a thirty- 
minute high-temperature ster- 
ilization. He became aware of 
an ache in his broad shoul- 
ders — and also that the ap- 
proach alarm was still clam- 
oring. 

“All right!” he growled, 
and climbed aboard the scoot- 
er without which he would 
never have been able to po- 
lice the three square miles of 
asteroid farm. ‘T hear you, 
damn it! Tm coming!” 

The scooter purred busily 
along, its moron mind follow- 

6 



ing the exact mid-line of the 
high galleries between the 
culture houses — glassite cells 
full of writhing, struggling, 
burgeoning life. 

At thirty, Jacob O'Simon 
had a lot behind him — a de- 
gree, a solid reputation in 
biology, a teaching post in 
botany, among other things. 
Won the hard way, he had 
gladly sacrificed them for 
this, for total isolation on a 
tiny asteroid. This chunk of 
rock no more than a mile 
through, dignified with the 
title Ajax HI, because it was 
one of the cluster around 
Ajax, itself only one of a larg- 
er cluster, the Trojans, cir- 
cling Sol in the orbit of 
mighty Jupiter. 

H ere, with a slow-fusion 
inferno safely buried in 
the core to provide heat and 
power, with a triple-layered, 
impact-proof roof over his 
head, and instrumentation 
which could maintain any de- 
sired environmental condi- 
tions, he was alone with his 
plants — and happy, almost. 
Each ninetieth day the shut- 
tle rocket called, bringing- 
supplies, new specimens, re- 
ports and recommendations, 
and taking away other speci- 
mens, analyses, advices, and, 
occasionally, orders for his 
frugal needs. 

He could, if necessary, con- 
tact Ajax Base at any time by 
radio, but he did this seldom, 
and then only to ask a ques- 



JOHN RACKHAM 




tion, never to pass the time of 
day. 

For Jacob O’Simon had 
one great character failing. 
He just could not stand peo- 
ple. His very / few friends 
were all of the type who 
could be relied on to let him 
alone unless it was something 
really important. At first 
thought, this job might have 
been made for such a man, but 
there was a snag. 

“Of course three square 
miles of observational data is 
a lot, Jacob,” George Viner 
had said. “You need at least 
one assistant — ” 

“Assistant!” Jacob had 
snorted. “Of course I could do 
with an assistant — somebody 
who would have no interests 
but the job in hand, who 
wouldn’t chatter all the time, 
who would do exactly what 
he was told, when he was told, 
who would know what to look 
for, and when, without being 
told, who wouldn't get on my 
nerves with a lot of silly, per- 
sonal gab — you find me some- 
one like that and I’ll take him 
on!” 

“Someone or something, 
Jacob?” George Viner had 
asked. “I may not find such a 
person, but — ” 

“Now don’t give me that 
robot sales talk, George,” said 
Jacob, for Viner was a spe- 
cialist in automation, cyber- 
netics and thinking mechan- 
isms in general. “There never 
was and ever will be a ma- 
chine that could do what I 



want. It takes life to observe 
life and understand it. You 
have some pretty smart ro- 
bots, able to deal with any 
predictable situation, but 
there never was a machine 
yet to do plant research — ” 

The scooter slid up the in- 
cline to the landing lock, and 
Jacob got off, with the ghost 
of Viner’s laugh still in his 
ears. He cut off the alarm, 
which action made contact be- 
tween him and the shuttle 
pilot. 

“About time !” came a heav- 
ily disgusted voice. “Another 
minute and I was coming 
down to collect the body. You 
all right?” 

“Yes, I’m all right,” said 
Jacob. “Got anything spe- 
cial?” 

“I do have a schedule to 
keep to!” was the pointed re- 
ply. “Your can ready to pick 
up?” 

“Give me a minute to load 
up.” Jacob leaned on the 
heavy door to the loading bay 
and launched himself into the 
zero-gravity zone inside. The 
door swung shut, cutting off 
the squawks from the inter- 
com to hurry it up. 

“Schedules!” he muttered, 
as he swam to the twenty-foot 
cylinder which housed his lat- 
est batch of results. “Does he 
worry about my schedules?” 

He loosed the can, braced 
his legs against the bulkhead 
and shoved, steering it in the 
direction of the open trap of 
the ship. For a moment, he 



IF YOU WISH 



7 




saw it in his mind as it must 
seem from outside: the ship, 
like some dark beetle, clutch- 
ing close to the bright sur- 
face, its probe dug deep, as if 
sucking the nectar from some 
giant blossom. 

T he can clanged into place. 

Jacob made a backward 
flip clear. The bay door hum- 
med and groaned shut. There 
was a screech of snug-fitting 
metal as the probe drew up 
and out, airtight plates snick- 
ing into place. 

‘"Damned quick-on-the- 
draw merchant,'' Jacob growl- 
ed. “Trap me in the damn 
door one of these times." He 
shoved off and drifted down 
to the gleaming floor where a 
duplicate can rested. He swam 
around it — and stared. It was 
standing open! 

“What the hell?" He hung 
a moment, scanning the in- 
terior. There were the usual 
stacks of thermo-flasks, all in 
code colors — and one brightly 
silvered tube. A letter can! 
Who would be sending him a 
letter, unless it was something 
bad ? He reached for the tube, 
twisted it open, and frowned 
at the paper inside. 

“Dear Jacob," he read, 
“I've taken the liberty of en- 
closing a device with this 
shuttle. Try it. I'd like your 
opinion. It answers to ‘Susan' 
— pardon the whimsy, and 
blame my niece, herself a 
biologist and botanist and one 
of your admirers — " 



He paused to wonder, 
frowning. Niece? A vague 
memory came to him, from 
those nightmarish days when 
he had been trying to instill 
knowledge into dim and un- 
willing pupils — a fog^ pic- 
ture of a scrawny girl, all 
teeth and intense eyes. 

He shuddered and read on. 
“Volition enough to preserve 
itself from destruction or in- 
jury — instant retention of 
any instruction without ap- 
parent limit, conditioned to 
obey absolutely, without ques- 
tion, overriding the personal 
safety circuit — and is, of 
course, quite harmless, being 
subject to the basic laws of 
robotics." 

Jacob crumpled the paper 
with a savage hand. Laws of 
robotics ! He kicked away 
from the can, looking around 
for this device, while the fa- 
miliar words echoed in his 
mind: 

“No robot shall injure a 
human, or by inaction allow 
injury to come to a hu- 
man — " A twentieth century 
fiction-writer’s pipedream. As 
if it would ever be possible to 
build into a machine brain 
the answer to a problem that 
man himself had not yet solv- 
ed ! Each man had to discover 
for himself just what was in- 
jurious, and what not — and 
no man, so far, had reached a 
full solution for that, much 
less a general one for humans 
in general. Any robot faced 
with that task would surely 



8 



JOHN RACKHAM 




blow a fuse before it had 
gone three steps. 

But where was the blasted 
thing? He frowned again, 
assessing the evidence. Open 
can — either someone had left 
it open — carelessness — or 
someone or something had 
opened it. A robot with ini- 
tiative? He shook his head, 
suddenly mindful of the doz- 
en and one things being neg- 
lected while he was hovering 
here. Groping for the cable 
which lay coiled in a recess in 
the can, he looped it through 
the lugs of the thermo-flasks, 
hauled taut and kicked off for 
the opposing door, which led 
to stores and living space. The 
flasks hung in a long line aft- 
er him. 

Reaching the door, he shov- 
ed it open, dived through, 
letting the grav-field catch 
him as he crossed the boun- 
dary zone. Landing catlike, he 
spun and hauled, trapping 
each flask as it became heavy. 
When the last one had clunk- 
ed into place, he eased away 
from the door, letting it swing 
shut. 

By habit, he glanced at his 
wrist, computing ahead. Two 
or three things he had missed 
— so he had missed them; no 
use worrying about that. All 
told, he had something like a 
clear hour ahead now. By 
that time a certain batch of 
Venus-born cousins of the 
common Earthside horsetail 
was due to fructify, and 
would be ready for trans- 

IF YOU WISH 



planting. Failing the very, 
lively and extremely virulent 
miniature lizards which per- 
formed that function for them 
on their own planet, and the 
inability of any Earth-bom 
insect to survive that atmos- 
phere, that was a job for him. 
A hot, unpleasant and tedious 
job. So now would be a good 
time to eat. This new stuff 
could wait. 

He turned and saw— -her. 

S HE stood absolutely immo- 
bile, in the midst of what 
he was pleased to call his din- 
ing room. She was tall, slim, 
solemnly blue-eyed, her face 
a smooth mask of quiet atten- 
tion. Bright golden hair form- 
ed an aureole of crisp, tight 
curls about her head. She 
wore exquisitely tailored 
white slacks, a white, short- 
sleeved shirt — her skin gleam- 
ed a flawless bronze against 
the white. She stood quite 
still. 

He realized he was gaping, 
wide-mouthed, and took a 
deep breath. His wits slowed 
their dizzy spin. Flawless 
tailoring — utter immobility — 
glowing skin — golden curls 
— the classic regularity of 
feature — she was beautiful — 
too beautiful ! 

‘‘Susan?” he queried, in 
sudden illumination. 

There was a slow, grave in- 
clination of the head, nothing 
more. Wild thoughts pin- 
wheeled in his brain. This 
must be some fantastic jest 



9 




on Viner’s part — some at- 
tempt to trap him into indis- 
cretions. He reread the letter, 
mentally. ‘Hnstant retention 
of any instructions — condi- 
tioned to obey absolutely — ” 

‘'Can you cook?” he asked, 
and instantly cursed his own 
inanity. Again there was that 
grave nod, nothing more. 
What was she — it? — waiting 
for now? He looked away 
from those bright blue eyes 
uneasily, striving to steady 
his thoughts. What now? The 
word “instructions” came 
back to him. Of course! This 
was a blank mind which had 
to learn everything from him. 
For a brief moment he was 
staggered by the magnitude 
of the prospective task, but 
then reason came back with 
a rush. 

It must know quite a lot al- 
ready — enough to get out of 
the can, find its way in here. 
It understood his questions. It 
claimed ability to cook. Per- 
haps it could handle package 
instructions ! He went for- 
ward cautiously. 

“Come!” he said, with ex- 
aggerated care. “Here is the 
cooking console. Here are the 
material bins. Prepare syn- 
tho-steak, biscuits, coffee — 
and I like my coffee black and 
strong. All right?” 

Again that cool nod. He 
watched while it made the 
first competent movements. 
That was all right, seeming- 
ly. He retreated to the dining 
room and set to work check- 



ing and sorting the new ar- 
rivals. The semi-automatic 
activity gave him time to set 
his thoughts in order. 

First he cursed Viner for 
his weird wit. Was it neces- 
sary to make the thing fe- 
male, and so impossibly 
perfectly female, at that? 
And she was certainly perfect. 
Jacob visualized her in his 
mind, seeing the sculptured 
structure of her face, and as 
much of the body as was be- 
trayed by her clothes. 

Human-copy manikins were 
common enough, he knew. 
Mass entertainment via full- 
color three-dimensional TV 
had made them necessary. 
The public refused to be 
fooled by pretended and in- 
sinuated stabbings, bashings 
and other tidbits. They de- 
manded the real thing. Actors, 
understandingly, were reluc- 
tant to carp^ realism quite so 
far. Technical ingenuity had 
produced the perfect com- 
promise — human-copy mani- 
kins which could be program- 
med to perform a few limited 
actions — duplicates with plas- 
tic but gruesomely realistic 
flesh, blood and vital organs. 

H e had never been close 
to one before and didn't 
want to be. He raged at Viner. 
Then, suddenly, he smiled. 
Poor old George ! All that ex- 
quisite sculpture and design, 
for what? A real girl as dev- 
astatingly attractive as that 
would have had him babbling 



10 



JOHN RACKHAM 




and furious by now — but 
here he was, quite unmoved. 
As he had so often argued, 
it's not the way people look, 
but the way — the stupid way 
— they think. 

He wondered how this 
thing thought. Did it think in 
the accepted sense? A mem- 
ory unit was a massive affair. 
Programming it was a spe- 
cialist's job. He sat back on 
his heels, wondering. Would 
Viner have built in a few 
comedy values for kicks? On 
reflection, Jacob thought not. 
Viner had a vile sense of hu- 
mor, true, but he was all 
seriousness when it came to 
his own field. 

Jacob completed his cata- 
loguing and went back to the 
cooking area, just in time to 
see the robot take up a fully 
laden tray. 

‘"Here," he said, “on this 
table — " and watched as the 
tray was set down. Two 
places ? 

“You going to eat, too?" 

Again that emotionless nod 
and the silent, patient wait. 
He struggled to fit this new 
factor into the picture. Prob- 
ably a general-purpose con- 
verter system took in raw 
material and supplied energy 
— he had a waste-disposal 
unit which did just that. But 
a sudden thought stiffened 
him. It hadn't made a sound 
yet. 

“You can— talk?" 

“If you wish." The voice 
was cool, impersonal, quiet. 



He breathed out again, 
thankfully. “Well, now, that's 
something to be thankful for, 
isn't it? I'm not the type to go 
nuts talking to myself, but I 
sure would, talking to some- 
thing that didn't talk back. All 
right, let's eat!" 

He sat and began his frugal 
meal, watching it do likewise, 
with quiet, precise move- 
ments and the flash of white, 
even teeth. 

“You're almost human!" he 
said, through a mouthful of 
deliciously done steak. 

It made no response. He 
scowled, felt irritation swell 
up — and then the answer hit 
him. What sort of answer 
could it make to a statement 
like that? To get a reply, he 
must ask a question. He glow- 
ed. Complete obedience — no 
idle chatter — maybe Viner 
had something, after all! 

D raining a second cup of 
perfectly made coffee, he 
leaned back and considered 
his next move. He would need 
to find out just how far the 
education angle would have to 
be taken. Could this thing 
learn the difference between 
one plant and another, be- 
tween a spore and a seed? But 
there was one question which 
should come first, a tricky 
one. 

“Just how human are you, 
anyway?" 

“As human as you wish," 
it said without emphasis. 

He grinned, ruefully. Very 

11 



IF YOU WISH 




smart, too. Ask a silly ques- 
tion — ! 

“All right.” He got up. 
“You're chief cook and dish- 
washer from here on out. 
Best grub Tve tasted in a 
long while. Now, while you're 
clearing away, Fll get the 
scooter and we'll go take a 
look at the other aspect of the 
job.” 

He punched in Sector 7 on 
the scooter's panel and trun- 
dled it around to the front. 
Susan was waiting. With the 
two of them aboard, the little 
platform was crowded. 

“You're warm!” he com- 
mented, touching the smooth 
skin of the robot's arm. 
“George did a first-class job 
on you. Was it necessary — 
this extreme duplication?” 

“Structure and function 
are interrelated,” it said 
smoothly. “I have been equip- 
ped with totally human poten- 
tials, senses and responses. It 
was found that the simplest 
way to achieve this was to 
make me human in structure. 
Hence my skin, like yours, is 
sensitive to touch, tempera- 
ture and humidity.” 

J ACOB took his hand away 
hastily, and cursed himself 
for doing it. So it was a fair 
copy — so what? 

“How much do you know 
about what I'm doing here?” 
he asked, getting on to safer 
ground. 

“General concepts only,” 
the robot said. “This is a re- 

12 



search planetoid for con- 
trolled investigation of the 
possibilities for accelerating 
the evolution of native Venus 
flora, with the object of ren- 
dering the atmospheric con- 
ditions of that planet suitable 
for human occupation — ” 

“Oh, great!” he sneered. 
“Straight out of the book. 
Pure bafflegab — you know 
what that is?” 

“The word is not in my vo- 
cabulary.” 

“Well, it will be. Now I 
want you to forget all that 
jargon, and let me give it to 
you in simple one-syllable 
words. Can you forget?” 
“Whatever you wish.” 
“That's fine. The wisdom of 
life consists in the elimina- 
tion of the non-essentials.” 
“Lin Yutang,” it said calm- 
ly, and he blinked. 

“Eh? What was that?” 
“Lin Yutang was a Chinese 
philosophical writer, the au- 
thor of the saying you just 
quoted.” 

Jacob felt his mouth begin- 
ning to sag, and shut it hast- 
ily. “Is that so? Well — look, 
we're now passing through 
Sector 3. In these houses 
there used to be typical Venus 
atmosphere. Surface atmos- 
phere, I mean. About two 
miles above the surface, 
Venus is very like Earth, only 
hotter, more humid, and load- 
ed with excess CO 2 . Because 
of perpetual turbulence, air- 
borne life never got started. 
So — no birds or insects — and 



JOHN RACKHAM 




plant life has to struggle 
along by other methods. Mi- 
cro-lizards fill the gap, but not 
as efficiently as bees and such. 

“So, in this sector, I have 
taken a sample collection of 
Venus flora, helped it become 
fertile and grow. As a result, 
the COj is well down already, 
and the humidity, too. So the 
basic idea is sound. But it just 
is not possible to protect, fer- 
tilize and assist each individ- 
ual plant on the whole surface 
of a planet. So, here, in Sec- 
tor 5, which we are now com- 
ing into — ” the scooter swung 
around a right angle and 
purred off down another glas- 
site-line lane — “you would 
find certain mutated strains 
of certain selected plants, and 
in Sector 7, where we are 
headed, are the few final 
products which have proved 
successful. Even-numbered 
sectors, by the way, are on the 
opposite hemisphere. They’re 
control areas, with a con- 
stantly maintained pui*e 
Venus-type atmosphere. Any 
questions so far?” 

“On what basis do you se- 
lect plant-forms for "experi- 
mentation?” 

“Smart girl!” he approved 
wryly. “You have your finger 
right on the sore place. It’s 
not enough that I should have 
to comb through a zillion spe- 
cies to find the few that ai’e 
viable enough to be worth 
encouraging — oh, no! This is 
research, but it is costing 
money, meaning there has to 



be some profit. So I have to 
nurse such things as might 
show a dividend sometime!” 
“You called me ‘girl’ a mo- 
ment ago,” it said impersonal- 
ly. “Do you wish me to re- 
spond to that term?” 

“I did?” He thought back, 
then nodded. “That’s right, I 
did. You mind?” 

“Why should I?” 

“Why should you? Look, 
I’m liable to get excited from 
time to time — and there’s only 
the two of us — so I’ll be 
meaning you — unless I’m 
talking to myself. Use your 
discretion. You do have dis- 
cretion, don’t you?” 

“Just as you wish,” it said. 

H e began to feel the first 
small stirrings of dissat- 
isfaction. This, he saw, was 
what it must have been like 
with slaves, and why such 
civilizations inevitably fell 
apart. It was demoralizing. 
He wondered what it would 
feel like to be demoralized. 
The scooter chuckled to itself 
and swung into Sector 7. He 
shuddered, thrust away his 
dreads, and began to look out 
for the correct moment to hop 
off. 

“Horsetail.” He pointed 
through the glassite. “This 
plant is an almost exact du- 
plicate of our own Earthside 
equisetum. Logical, when you 
think of it. Horsetail is pret- 
ty primitive — one of the 
earlier cryptogams. You know 
any botany?”

“Green, ribbed, aerial 
shoots,” it recited. “Those 
bearing leaf whorls are ster- 
ile. The fertile nodes bear a 
dense oval spike consisting of 
short-stalked bracts with 
spore cases — ” 

“All right! All right! 
Damned walking reference 
file ! Who was it that said ex- 
act information is the imme- 
diate death of conversation?” 
“The origin of the saying is 
not known, but it is almost 
certainly Graeco-Roman.” 
“There I go again, asking 
damned silly questions.” lie 
took out a pair of small plas- 
tic bags. “Listen, this is what 
we’re going to do. We want 
those two big fructifications 
there, see? They’re just about 
ready to open up. The rest are 
below standard. I’ll go first, 
right down to the far end, to 
plug in the heavy-duty cables. 
You grab those two spikes 
and bag ’em and get out. I’ll 
be right after you.” 

He undogged the heavy 
glassite door, swung it open 
and hurried down the lane be- 
tween the plant beds. It was 
like being in a damp oven. He 
bent, grabbed cable ends, 
shoved them home, straight- 
ened and hurried back. 

“Got ’em? Good. Now I’ll 
just seal down this door.” 
That done, he threw the 
switch, and they watched as 
the twin lanes of greenish- 
brown soil sizzled and smok- 
ed into sterility. 

“That,” he said, “is the 

14 



only way to get rid of those 
beggars. Just like home 
horsetails — it only wants one 
little bit of the rhizome to 
start a whole new plant 
proliferating. Now we have 
to spread the spores from this 
lot over some clean ground. 
Jump on. The nearest vacant 
lot is some distance from 
here.” 

Aftei* a thoughtful silence, 
it said, “Why horsetail?” 
“Believe it or not, it’s 
gold!” he sneered. “The last 
batch I had processed out at 
fifteen ounces per ton of ash. 
This lot should be better — but 
you’d think mankind would 
have lost the golden itch by 
this time.” 

“That is to examine the 
concept from an outdated 
viewpoint,” it commented. 
“Recent advances in metal- 
lurgy employ gold as a syn- 
ergic in new alloy processes.” 
“They do?” he said weakly. 
“What the hell does ‘synergy’ 
mean?” 

“Synergism — ” the quiet 
voice was prompt and flow- 
ing — “is the cooperative ac- 
tion of discrete agencies such 
that the total effect is greater 
than the sum of the two ef- 
fects taken separately.” 

“You know what? If you 
were human. I’d hate your 
guts!” 

“You are offended?” 

“No, just thankful you’re 
not human. Whoa ! This’ll 
do!” He stopped the scooter 
again by a window where the 

JOHN RACKHAM 




soil-lanes were virginally 
smooth. ''Now this can be 
tricky. Let me explain. You 
hold a spike in one hand over 
the soil, poke a hole with a 
finger, tap the bract so that 
some spores fall into the hole, 
poke the finger close by so 
that the hole closes up again. 
Sounds simple, but don't let 
any of the spores touch your 
skin or you’ll be sorry — that 
is, if your skin is chemically 
like mine — and don’t miss the 
hole so that the spores fall on 
the surface or they’ll get 
caught up in the little breeze 
we’ll make — and we’ll both be 
sorry. A good way is to hold 
your breath — ” 

"Protective clothing and a 
mask would be better.” 

"Strictly for amateurs ! Be- 
sides, it’s hot enough in there 
without being wrapped up. 
You ready? Right down to the 
far end and work back. That 
way we minimize the risks.” 

S WINGING open the heavy 
door, he went through. He 
took his spike from its bag, 
and holding it carefully by 
the tip, he crouched over the 
hot, damp soil, poking and 
tapping with expert speed. 
He assumed his helper was 
doing likewise, but was much 
too intent with his own job to 
watch anything else. They 
reached the door simultane- 
ously. 

He turned from securing 
the door, to find Susan pink 
and gleaming, its whites 



stained with perspiration, 
and dabbing at the open neck 
of its shirt. 

"Spores?” he guessed. 
"Don’t do that — only makes it 
worse. Come on.” He led the 
way at a trot to the corner of 
the glassite tunnel, to a wall 
compartment. "Germicidal 
jelly — got a stock of these all 
over the place. Here, slap 
some of this on it.” He uncap- 
ped a tube of violently purple 
goo, then hesitated. "Better 
take that shirt off. This stuff 
is practically a dye.” 

He waited while the trim 
garment came off, then offer- 
ed the jelly again. 

"Feels good, doesn’t it?” he 
said. "Damn spores burn like 
fire — blister, too, if you don’t 
catch ’em quick. Turn round, 
let me look at your back.” He 
looked, critically. "Lucky — 
you just got a small dose. All 
right now? That purple 
doesn’t do a thing for your 
looks, but it’ll wash off. You 
better leave that shirt, though, 
for the sterilizer.” 

He capped the tube, put it 
back in the compartment. 

"You stay here. I’ll bring 
the scooter and we’ll run back 
to base.” 

He went off, grinning to 
himself. Damn robot might be 
smart at book-learning, but it 
took a botanist to handle 
plants. Still, pretty clever of 
old George to fabricate a 
"skin” like that. Blistered 
just like a human, maybe a 
shade faster. Silky, too. He

reached the scooter, swung it 
around and climbed on. 

A wife like that, he 
thought with sudden wistful- 
ness, would be something. 
Pretty, capable, willing, obe- 
dient — but without any fem- 
inine caprices. A quote of 
Shawls came to mind: ‘'The 
ideal wife is one who does 
everything that the ideal hus- 
band wants, and nothing 
else.^' He wondered if she 
would be able to place that 
quote — and was aghast at the 
treachery of his own mind. 
What did he want with a wife 
of any kind? 

He slowed to a stop, to take 
her aboard. With the toe of 
his shoe he hooked the shirt 
into a bundle on the platform 
and drove on. 

“How's it feel now — still 
burning?" 

“A little. May I ask a ques- 
tion?" 

“Ask away. Only thing is, 
I'm not like you. I don't know 
all the answers." 

“The remark is without 
meaning. If I knew all the an- 
swers, there would be no 
need to ask questions." 

“Sorry. That told me off, all 
right. But I guess it's just my 
way. You'll get used to it." 

“Acceptance would be fa- 
cilitated if I knew your mo- 
tivation. You seem affable and 
pleasant in action, yet hostile 
and offensive in speech and 
value judgments. Why is 
that?" 

“Damned if I know!" he ad- 



mitted candidly. “On my 
own, I'm fine. Mix me with 
people and I come out 
wrong." 

“You dislike people?" 

E TURNED to the bright, 
attentive face so close to 
his. “I've never told this to 
anyone, but I hate being own- 
ed or influenced — or anyone 
trying to own or influence me 
— ^or anyone wanting me to 
own or influence them." He 
saw a blank look and sighed. 
“Maybe it is too much to ex- 
pect you to understand. I 
don't rightly understand it 
myself — " 

“But you own me now. Does 
that bother you?" 

“I do not!'' he denied hot- 
ly. “Nothing of the kind! You 
were dumped on me. I'm just 
trying to get along — and man- 
aging pretty well, too. But I 
don't own you. Any time I tell 
you to do something you don't 
want to do, you refuse. As far 
as I am concerned, you're a 
free agent. Got that?" 

“But if I am a free agent, 
how can I work with you?" 

“Don't know the answer to 
that one, either," he admitted. 
“I'm not too strong on phi- 
losophy, but isn't that what 
man has been trying to figure 
out all along? How do you co- 
operate with somebody else 
without losing something of 
yourself in the process?" 

“By limiting the coopera- 
tion to some external, imper- 
sonal activity such as this, so 




16 



JOHN RACKHAM 




that each individual concern- 
ed could contribute in equal 
measure yet without becom- 
ing involved in a personal 
prestige conflict.” 

“That sounds fine.” The 
scooter purred to a stop, and 
he led off to the living space. 
“Trouble is, people don’t 
work like that. Sooner or 
later — usually sooner — some- 
body wants to give orders, to 
be boss, to make somebody 
else jump. And there are al- 
ways those who want to be 
ordered around, too, believe it 
or not.” 

He took a pair of tongs 
from a cabinet. “Skip the 
philosophy for now. You need 
something more positive, like 
a shower. Over hex-e. Shed the 
rest of your gear and get on 
the grid.” 

He picked up the discarded 
clothing, collected the shirt, 
dumped the lot in the steriliz- 
er, and came back to the 
cubicle with a clutch of bot- 
tles in his hands. Susan stood 
on the chrome grid, watching 
him with that blue-eyed stare. 
He unfastened the injector 
cover and poured in generous 
helpings from the bottles. 

“Detergent,” he explained. 
“Analgesic, to kill the burn- 
ing. Germicide, to get any 
spores that might be left. And 
a faii’ly mild bleach, to get 
that purple stain off your — 
chest.” 

He corked the bottles again, 
and paused. “George overdid 
it a bit with your shape.” 



“You find it objectionable, 
or flawed in some way or 
other?” 

S HRUGGING, Jacob said, 
“If George had to make 
you anatomically perfect, he 
should have put in a flaw or 
two — a sag or a wrinkle or 
something. You’re too idealiz- 
ed to be real. I’d hate to meet 
a girl — a real girl — ^with a 
shape like that.” 

“Why?” asked the robot 
unemotionally. 

“Beauty like that has real 
power, you know. Power to 
drive men, irritate women — 
cause havoc in all directions. 
And what good’s a whip if 
you don’t get to crack it once 
in a while?” 

“But you are not thus af- 
fected. Why is that?” 

“Why? I grow some pretty 
beautiful flowers and they 
don’t affect me. Perhaps that’s 
it. A flower is not trying to do 
anything to me. A pretty girl 
would be saying, in effect, 
‘I’m beautiful — what are you 
going to do about it?’ Where- 
as you’re just beautiful, pe- 
riod.” 

He laughed at himself. 
“You know what? I can talk 
to you. I can’t talk to people 
at all — not without getting 
mad at ’em. Especially wom- 
en. But I’m gabbing too much 
now. You hold still a minute 
while I program the water. I 
might have a spore or two my- 
self, and I could do without 
some of the sweat. On this

job, a regular shower is a 
must.” 

The first impact of the 
needle-spray stung his flesh, 
so that he cringed. Through 
the steam, he saw Susan 
wince, too. 

“Hot!” he mumbled. “Fif- 
teen seconds of this, to open 
the pores — ” 

The biting hot needles ceas- 
ed. He tapped the bronzed 
shoulder that glistened close 
to his chest. 

“Let’s have a look at those 
blisters,” he ordered, and put 
a gentle finger on the fading 
purple patches. He reached 
for a tissue and swabbed away 
the last of the protective jelly. 
The skin beneath was only 
faintly red. It kept quite still 
under his ministrations. For 
a wild moment, he imagined 
this to be a real female, and 
chuckled at the thought. 

“Why do you laugh?” the 
robot inquired. 

“I was just imagining what 
would happen if you were a 
1‘eal girl and I was doing this. 
It’s quite a strain on my im- 
agination.” 

“Why?” 

“Because — ^because I have- 
n’t had a lot of experience 
with girls, I suppose. Any- 
way, those spore marks look 
pretty clean. Stand by for the 
cold!” 

He was just in time. An 
icy-chill mist filled the cubicle, 
shocking and jolting the skin 
into vigorous reaction. He 
drew a deep, shuddering 

18 



breath, heard the robot do the 
same. 

“Good for the circula- 
tion — ” he chattered, blowing 
the spray from the end of his 
nose and laughing at the sight 
of crisp golden curls flattened 
to its head, and its eyes tight 
shut against flying droplets. 
The cold jets died and he was 
tingling all over. “Makes you 
feel good, eh?” 

It nodded, wide-eyed, and 
laughed. 

He was struck by the 
pleasant sound. “Say, that’s 
the first time I’ve heard you 
laugh!” 

“You object?” It was se- 
rious, at once. 

“For heaven’s sake, no! I 
like it fine. Go ahead and 
laugh all you want to!” 

“Maybe there is something 
wrong?” 

“No, not a thing. Honest.” 
He turned away abruptly. 
“Look, I prefer to rub down 
with a towel. It’s old-fash- 
ioned, I know, but I like it. 
How about you? Shall I 
switch on the drier?” 

“A towel, please.” 

J ACOB splashed across to 
another cabinet, got out a 
couple of squares of fleecy 
synthetic, tossed one to her, 
began rubbing himself brisk- 
ly with the other. Oddly up- 
setting phrases were echoing 
through his mind. 

“As human as you wish” — 
“I have been equipped with 
totaly human potentials” — 

JOHN RACKHAM 




“whatever you wish'’ — “as 
human as you wish!" That 
was the one with the barbs. 
The more he thought about it, 
the less he liked it. Wadding 
the towel, he tossed it into the 
sterilizer, followed it with his 
discarded clothes. 

“Susan." He went back to 
where it stood on the grid, 
slowly toweling its curls back 
to gleaming crispness. “You 
said you have as much discre- 
tion as I wish you to have, 
whatever that might mean. 
Do 1 take it that you have 
opinions, too?" 

“Just as you wish," it said, 
with that wide-eyed stare. 

He shook his head angrily. 
“I wish you'd quit that ‘just 
as you wish' routine." 

“I have done something 
wrong?" 

“Not wrong, exactly. It's 
just that — well, how the hell 
do you know what I wish?" 

“I obey your instructions." 

“Yeah, but I never told you 
to laugh." 

“You said the shower made 
you feel good and you laugh- 
ed. I merely did the same." 
The quietly reasonable tone 
began to be irritating. 

“Now look here — as far as 
the job is concerned, you'll 
do what I say — within reason, 
of course. I mean — " he grop- 
ed for words — “self-preserva- 
tion and so on. But that's all. 
The rest of the time, you act 
the way you want." 

“Just as you wish." 

He stared at that bright 

IF YOU WISH 



face, wondering if he was be- 
ing mocked, but the big blue 
eyes were steady. 

“That's what I wish," he 
growled. “You do whatever 
makes you feel good and don't 
pay any attention to me. Un- 
derstand?" 

“No — " Susan spoke slowly, 
shaking its head, rolling the 
towel into a neat ball. “I can- 
not understand that. I feel 
good when I do that which 
pleases you. That is my func- 
tion." 

“Oh, God!" He beat a fist 
into a palm, trying to find 
words that would free him 
from this irksome responsi- 
bility. Then he caught a sight 
of his wrist and his mental 
clock clicked over. “Skip that 
for now," he ordered. “We 
have work to do. Sector 3 — 
look, here on the diagram — " 
He went to the far wall, where 
there was a complex chart, 
much scribbled and annotated. 
“This is an experimental 
planting. Venus owns a thing 
enough like our Astragalus 
racecosus to be its cousin, but 
about a quarter the size. In 
this house I have seeded some 
of our natives along with the 
Venus variety. I'm hoping to 
hybridize the two — " 

“Astragalus racecosus — 
loco weed. Why?" 

“Selenium, plus a fair trace 
of vanadium and zinc. Rag- 
weeds are a bit better for zinc, 
but I haven't been able to es- 
tablish them in a Venus at- 
mosphere yet. Marley on Ajax

V expects to have fair success 
with it. He’s going in for 
trees, too. Venus has no 
trees.” 

“My botany indoctrina- 
tion did not include this. Are 
there many plants and trees 
which isolate metals?” 

“Plenty.” He pulled open a 
drawer. “Here, grab a couple 
— that’s all we’ll need this 
trip. Paintbrushes and pa- 
ti6ncG.^^ 

“Without clothing?'' asked 
the robot. 

‘That's up to you. This is 
not toxic and the climate is 
fine, if a bit warm, but suit 
yourself." 

“Very well. I am ready." 

He led the way to the scoot- 
er, and as soon as they were 
in motion, he reverted to the 
question. 

“Yes, there's a whole slew 
of Earth plants that isolate 
metals. You can get barium, 
for instance, from Brazil nuts. 
Hickory gives aluminum and 
magnesium. Copper you get 
from dandelions, spinach and 
tobacco. I have some very fine 
tobacco-type plants coming 
along in Sector 7. Lord knows 
what they'll be like to smoke, 
though ; the soil is pretty rich 
in antimony and that could be 
rough on the nasal passages. 
Venus soil is queer stuff, you 
know. Crawling with bacteria 
— like ours, of course — and 
damp all the time, but with no 
liquid water, there's no strati- 
fication. Just a fine general 
mixture of just about every- 

20 



thing you can lay a tongue ta 
You smoke, by the way?" 

He glanced aside and groan- 
ed. “All right, don't say it. If 
I wish — right?" 

It laughed, and the sweet 
sound sent little tinges along 
his spine. 

T he scooter clucked and 
stopped. He pointed to a 
window wall which framed a 
prospect that might have been 
Elysium, back on ancient 
Earth. 

“Pretty, isn't it?" He led 
the way down between the 
lanes of nodding, blowing 
blossoms, almost hip-high. 
“Now — " he knelt by a spread 
of richly purple blooms — 
“this is what you do." He 
made quick and expert dabs 
with the brush, transferring 
the sticky yellow pollen. “Got 
it? Only the very biggest of 
the purple ones, mind. The 
rest aren't worth the trouble." 

Susan crouched and went 
to work, duplicating his move- 
ments. “This is Venus atmos- 
phere that has been transmut- 
ed, you said?" 

“Yes." He stood up and 
looked down at the robot, not- 
ing the smooth efficiency, yet 
aware of the graceful femi- 
ninity. “This is hot, just un- 
der a hundred degrees Fahr- 
enheit, and there's about twice 
the CO 2 of Earth ; it's humid, 
but reasonably bearable. In 
Sector 2, where the atmos- 
phere is maintained at Venus 
normal, these babies are

scrawny things — and the air 
would choke you. A few bil- 
lion of these would make a 
hell of a difference. Men 
would be able to walk the sur- 
face of the planet without 
protection.'' He crouched 
down and got to work along- 
side the robot. 

‘^You wish to live on the 
surface of Venus?" 

'‘Me? No, I’m not the pio- 
neering kind. I get along with 
plants. They don't bother me 
like people. Hah ! Back to phi- 
losophy again. I suppose 
that's a dead subject for a 
robot." 

"Not at all," it replied. "I 
can give you a philosophical 
debate, if you wish." 

"All right." He shuffled 
along the line of blooms. "I'll 
take you up on that. Why 
don't I get along with people." 

T MUSED looking like a 
Greek nymph in contempla- 
tion. "That is largely a ques- 
tion of attitude. How do you 
think of people?" 

"I've tried that and I get 
some very odd answers. I'm 
all alone here, so I get plenty 
of time for thinking. I have 
come to the conclusion that, 
as far as I am concerned, peo- 
ple are just things out there. 
I know about me, what I 
think, how I feel — but that's 
all I know. All the rest is 
guesswork and inference. I 
don't know, for instance, what 
you think or how you feel. I 
can oniy hear what you say, 



see what you do, and go by; 
that." 

"Then — to you — ^there is no 
difference between me and 
anyone else?” 

"Put it like that — no. Ex- 
cept that you're idealized. No 
real girl could be so perfect 
or so efficient. Otherwise, 
though, there is no differ- 
ence." 

It spun to face him. "Then 
why are you at ease with me?" 

He hopped awkwardly to 
another bloom, paintbrush 
busy, while he pondered that 
one. "You have a point," he 
said. "You mean — it's me, my 
attitude to people, that makes 
all the difference? All right, 
suppose I admit that — what 
do I do with the informa- 
tion?" 

They had reached the end 
of a row. Susan stood up and 
looked at him calmly. "Treat 
everybody just the same way 
you treat me, of course." 

"Hah! I'm to assume that 
the whole universe is popu- 
lated with robots, and that I'm 
the only real person among 
them?" He chuckled, then, 
growing serious, said, "It's a 
way, though. People are the 
way they are not because 
they're wonderful or whacky, 
but because that's the way 
they have been designed and 
programmed, by life and ex- 
perience, and they can't help 
it, eh? You know — " he was 
suddenly depressed — "I'm en- 
joying this, and it can't last. 
You're too good for this job.

Old George will be taking you 
away and Tm going to miss 
you.” 

S HOULDER to shoulder, 
they worked back down 
another twin row. He knew an 
inexplicable yet powerful im- 
pulse to reach out and stroke 
that silky bronze skin so near 
to his, to ruffle that halo of 
crisp golden curls. He fought 
himself, cursing inwardly. 
Getting maudlin over a robot ! 

They finished the row in 
silence. 

Outside the secured glassite 
door, he glanced at his watch 
again. '‘Nothing urgent now 
for another seven, eight 
hours. I figure to have a bite 
and then get some sleep. O.K. 
with you?” 

“I, too, am aware of fatigue 
effects and the need for food,” 
replied Susan. “I will prepare 
a meal and then we will sleep 
together.” 

“You got that bit wrong,” 
he said as they remounted the 
scooter. “You don't sleep with 
me — not in the usally accepted 
sense of that phrase. You 
know what I mean?” 

“Of course. You do not wish 
me to sleep with you, then?” 
“That's what I said!” he 
snapped. 

The scooter trundled up the 
incline to the living space and 
stopped. He got off, suddenly 
conscious of their nudity. 

“Get the grub ready,” he 
growled, “while I write up the 
data on what we've just done. 



And get some clothes on. You 
can use mine!” 

He strode stiffly to the lock- 
er which held his stock of 
shirts, slacks and socks, took 
what he needed, left it open, 
pointedly, and strode off to 
the records office. 

There he sat and stared at 
the tabulated white sheet and 
strove to push away other pic- 
tures that threatened to flood 
his mind. The struggle start- 
ed beads of sweat on his brow. 
Sex fantasies are an occupa- 
tional hazard to the solitary 
man. Jacob knew this and had 
considered himself stable 
enough to ignore the danger. 
But this was an attack from a 
quarter which had never oc- 
curred to him in his wildest 
moments. And what frighten- 
ed him most was the very fact 
that it was a fight. He should 
have been able to dismiss the 
matter with simple, cold logic. 

Damn Viner! And damn 
Susan, too, for being so im- 
peccably and perfectly beauti- 
ful ! Fully human responses — 
just how far did that go, any- 
way? If performance to date 
was anything to go by — 

He made a’ supreme effort 
and banished the temptation 
from his mind. No — that was 
the simple, short and only an- 
swer — no! He became aware 
of a softly feminine voice tell- 
ing him the food was ready. 

He went into the dining 
room. The robot stood by the 
table, waiting. He looked — 
and looked again. Wearing 



22 



JOHN RACKHAM 




one of his stretch-mesh sweat- 
shirts, there was no longer any 
sense in trying to think of 
this as an ‘‘it/' It was blatant- 
ly a ''she/’ He looked away 
uncomfortably and sat. 

The food was good in his 
mouth and its very excellence 
was added torment. He stole 
a glance. She was quite silent, 
neatly busy with her own por- 
tion. He wondered what was 
going on in that exquisitely 
shaped head. Just where did 
"fully human” cease? Maybe 
she was offended at his rejec- 
tion of her advances — or were 
they "services”? 

He pushed away his empty 
plate. 

"Come!” he said. 'Til show 
you your bed.” 

H e led the way to a small 
compartment that had, as 
one wall, a clear glassite 
panel, looking out on a dupli- 
cation of the alien scenery of 
Venus. There, in an endless 
hot twilight, stunted strug- 
gling vegetation fought its 
ceaseless battle against the 
elements, and a myriad tiny, 
gemlike lizards. 

She stood a moment. Then : 
'‘Master ” 

"Call me Jacob!” he said 
roughly. “What is it?” 

"I have offended in some 
way?” 

"Why do you ask that?” 
"You do not wish me to 
sleep with you. You have in- 
structed me to wear clothing.” 
"So?” 



"You said I was to obey 
your instructions insofar as it 
concerned the operation of the 
station, but that in all other 
matters I would please my- 
self.” 

"Yeah — and you said that 
you wanted to do whatever 
would please me, and it does 
not please me to have you run- 
ning around naked — or get- 
ting ideas about hopping into 
my bed!” 

"Then my appearance is not 
pleasing to you?” 

"I didn’t say that. You’re 
attractive, but you’re a ro- 
bot.” 

"The rest of the universe 
is populated with robots, as 
far as you are concerned, you 
said.” 

"That was just talk,” he 
snarled. "I can’t treat you 
like a human.” 

"I am as human as you 
wish.” 

"There you go again!” he 
shouted. "You don’t under- 
stand. It’s not what I wish at 
all. Look, if I was to take a 
woman to bed — which fate 
forbid! — it would be because 
she wanted me to — not just to 
please me ! Can’t you see 
that?” 

"If it would please you, then 
I would want you to.” 

"But it would not please 
me, not unless I knew that it 
was as much your idea as 
mine — and because you’re a 
robot, without ideas of your 
own, that is out, it’s impossi- 
ble — see?”

"A human woman would 
be pleased to do whatever 
would give pleasure to her 
man.” The voice was quietly 
insistent. 

‘‘Like hell she would!” He 
laughed harshly. “But let’s not 
go into that just now. Look, 
Susan — to be crude — have you 
ever slept with a man?” The 
words were thick in his 
throat, but he managed to get 
them out. 

“No.” 

“There you are, then! How 
do you know that it would 
either bring or give pleas- 
ure?” 

“Have you ever slept with 
a woman — Jacob?” 

“Oh, no you don’t!” he said 
hurriedly. “You’re not going 
to trip me up that way. As a 
mater of fact — no, I haven’t, 
but that’s got nothing to do 
with it. Here, this is your 
bunk. And this is mine, right 
next door. I’m going to bed. 
Alone! Get me?” 

“Very well, Jacob,” she 
said, and turned her face up 
to him so simply and naturally 
that he kissed her before he 
realized it. Her lips were cool 
and soft. 

“Good night,” she whisper- 
ed, and, shedding her clothes, 
slid between the crisp, fresh 
sheets. 

Still dazed, he went next 
door and climbed into his own 
bunk, and lay wide-eyed in 
the gloom, wondering. Just 
what had George Viner done 
here? 



J ACOB dug back into his 
mind for anything he could 
recall about robot mecha- 
nisms, and it was quite a lot. 
The station itself was full of 
them — thermostats, humidity 
controls, gravity stabilizers, 
unit analysis recorders, tim- 
ing mechanisms of all kinds — 
his whole environment was 
made and maintained by con- 
stantly vigilant automatics, 
many of which he never had 
to touch, much less under- 
stand. 

But a thinking, feeling, 
argumentative, logical robot 
was something else again. 

The human shape, of itself, 
imposed restrictions on hu- 
man-copy manikins which 
limited them to simple repet- 
itive actions. There was noth- 
ing simple about Susan — or 
she was too simple, depending 
on the point of view. Viner 
must have developed a whole 
new technique for her. For 
the life of him, Jacob could 
not help thinking of “her” 
rather than “it.” So utterly 
non-human in some ways — 
the calm, the logic, the incred- 
ibly perfect face and figure — 
yet so appealingly easy to un- 
derstand and get on with — 
most of the time. 

Jacob let that train of 
thought run its course, and 
came to a conclusion that 
shocked him for a moment. 
Then logic took over. After 
all, he asked himself, just 
what was the difference be- 
tween something that walked.

talked, acted and reacted like 
a human — ^and a human? 

He awoke from a crawly, 
sweaty dream of being chased 
down endless, glassite corri- 
dors, hotly pursued by a 
screeching, straggle - haired 
woman-shaped thing, trailing 
a gaggle of clanking, idiot- 
faced, mechanical urchins. 
The horrible harridan, drag- 
ging one dead-eyed child, was 
screaming: “Jacob! Jacob!” 

She was nudging his shoul- 
der gently, her bright face 
wide-eyed and attentive, yet 
remote. 

“Huh?” He struggled up 
onto one elbow, glanced at 
his watch. “Oh. All right. 
Thanks.” 

“Breakfast?” 

“Not for me.” He sat up 
and stretched. “Look in the 
cold bin. You’ll see a flask 
marked ‘Berry Extract’. 
That’s for me. You have coffee 
if you want.” 

She had poured two beakers 
of the liquid, which was ting- 
ed with blue and smelled 
faintly of mint. 

He took his. 

“You might not like it,” he 
warned. “It’s bitterish, but 
it’s the biggest thing I’ve 
struck yet, bar one. This 
comes from a miserable little 
pod-bearer, one of a dozen or 
more, but this variety some- 
how is proof against the liz- 
ards. Seems they don’t like 
the flavor. So although it 
propagates only by rare acci- 
dent — wind and luck — it does 



get to the pod stage. The 
others don’t get that far.” 

He took a generous mouth- 
ful, shuddered. “That,” he 
said, “is, in essence, the eco- 
logical problem of Venus. The 
lizards are the fertilizing 
mechanism, the symbiotes — 
but they are also damned vo- 
racious. So, over the millen- 
nia that life has been strug- 
gling there, very little prog- 
ress has been made. It’s more 
of a check than a balance!” 

“I see that.” She sampled 
the juice thoughtfully. “But 
why is this so important?” 
“Water! There is no natu- 
rally occurring liquid water 
on the planet, although the at- 
mosphere is loaded with it. 
Humid but not liquid. Only 
the plants and the lizards can 
accumulate liquids, and this 
particular plant has pods full 
of it. If we could seed enough 
acres with this stuff, it would 
solve a lot of problems.” 

“You said ‘the biggest thing 
— bar one.’ What is the 
other?” 

“That’s something we’re 
going to take a look at right 
now, soon as you’re ready.” 
“Is my clothing satisfac- 
tory?” she inquired without 
emotion. 

H e tried to examine her 
objectively, but was forc- 
ed to avert his eyes. He was 
learning, belatedly, that par- 
tial concealment is more pro- 
vocative than total revelation. 
“Take ’em off,” he said awk-

wardly. ‘‘It's a Sector 5 job, 
so we don't need any, anyway. 
Hot but not non-toxic. Also, it 
could be tricky and clothes 
might get in the way." He 
was rationalizing, and he 
knew it. 

“But you object to lack of 
apparel.” 

“So I've changed my 
mind!” he said. 

“As you wish.” 

W HILE she stripped obedi- 
ently, he took up a bunch 
of plastic tubes, each one bell- 
ed out into a tiny trumpet at 
one end. “I'll explain as we 
go.” He squatted on the scoot- 
er beside her and gave her a 
tube. “This specimen is a 
fungus — and a weirdie. You 
ever hear of Fergus Lintz, one 
of the first to do research on 
Venus? Yes? Then you'll 
know that he's a first-rate 
man. Now he had a really 
fabulous experience which no- 
body really believed all the 
way. At times, he even doubts 
it himself. I'm told. Seems he 
was lost in a little valley, run- 
ning short of air and getting a 
bit light-headed. He knew he 
was fairly close to base, but 
too far gone to make it. Suit- 
radio on the blink, too. He 
was in a bad way. Then he 
stumbled across a big clump 
of fungi in a hollow and stop- 
ped to examine them. Can you 
imagine that? Death was star- 
ing him in the face, but this 
was something new — a new 
specimen — so he had to stop 

26 



and look. A real, dedicated 
botanist, old Fergus." 

The scooter swung dizzily 
into Sector 5. 

“Anyway, he took a look at 
these fungi — and, as he look- 
ed, he saw one of them blow 
a bubble at him ! Naturally, he 
thought he was in the first 
stages of delirium and he pro- 
ceeded to undo his faceplate, 
so as to get a better look — 
and it was that suicidal act 
which saved his life! You see, 
when he hunched over the lit- 
tle bed of fungi, another bub- 
ble blew off, and then it was a 
regular fountain of bubbles — 
and they burst right in his 
face. And they were oxygen! 
Oxygen plus a slight per- 
fume — ” 

“Oxygen?" the robot que- 
ried. 

“Right — something like a 
cubic foot of it. Enough, any- 
way, to get him on his feet 
again and back to base. But 
not without a scoopful of the 
fungi. At base, they thought 
he was off his trolley, especial- 
ly when they failed to propa- 
gate the things. But Fergus 
stuck to his story — got a few 
specimens — and sent 'em to 
me with all the details." 

The scooter stopped and 
they went to the plexiglass 
window, where he checked the 
gauges carefully. Then, point- 
ing, he told her, “There's the 
last of the bunch. They look 
something like Amanita vela- 
tipes, don't they? But don’t 
let that fool you. This my- 



JOHN RACKHAM 




celium has a sex factor. That 
much Fve found out. This 
one — ” he indicated a pur- 
plish-white stem with a full- 
spread umbrella four inches 
across — ‘'is a male. Charac- 
teristics are the spread-out 
pilaeus with the vent in the 
top. Fve had some blow a bub- 
ble or two — three at most — 
then they wither, fast, very 
damned fast.'' 

Shifting his angle to indi- 
cate similar stems, but with 
an ovoid head in darker pur- 
ple, he said, “Those are fe- 
males. They bubble, too. Far 
as I can make out, the bubble 
effect is a spore-distributing 
mechanism. The membrane of 
the bubble is made from the 
volva, which this mycelium 
preserves in a semi-fluid state. 
But the spores — microscopic 
— are always sterile. The only 
answer I can figure is that two 
bubbles have to make contact 
to become fertile." 

“But the chances against 
that must be astronomical!" 

He shrugged. “On Earth, 
evolution is profligate. On 
Venus, it's skinflint. A chance 
in a million is good odds. 
Now this is what we do. Fve 
tried this before, but failed. 
Maybe you'll be luckier than 
me. Fm going to try to trap a 
bubble from a male and one 
from a female and mix 'em. 
All right? Remember, it's as 
hot as hell in there and heavy 
on COo. You'll sweat a lot, 
pant a bit — but it's bearable. 
Ready? Here we go." 



I N THE clammy heat, Jacob 
crouched, fighting to keep 
his breathing steady. He had 
a trumpet tube ready. The 
timing had been very good. 
The pilaeus swelled, pouted in 
the center and out popped a 
tiny bubble, swimming with 
translucent color, about an 
inch in diameter. He pushed 
the bell-end of the tube at it, 
sucking gently — and the bub- 
ble burst, with a sweet smell. 
He shook the sweat from his 
eyes and waited. Again the 
umbrella grew a hump in the 
middle, popped a bubble — and 
began to wither immediately. 

“See how damn fast every- 
thing happens?" he breathed, 
poking the tube delicately to- 
ward the drifting bubble. This 
time it stuck. 

Holding his breath, he slew- 
ed around, seeking a ready 
female. None were popping 
yet. One purple ovoid swelled 
and heaved. He waited fever- 
ishly, his hand shaking with 
the effort to hold it steady. 

“For Pete's sake, old lady," 
he muttered, “hurry up!" 

His captive bubble shiver- 
ed, burst — and, with exquisite 
timing, the female ovoid pout- 
ed and spouted a bubble — 
then another — and a third — 
and began to wither swiftly. 

“Damn!" he stood up. 
“Damn and blast this crazy, 
screwball life system! Here, 
you try." 

They moved to where a sec- 
ond male was showing signs 
of bubbling. She looked down, 

27 



IF YOU WISH 




frowning, a little bead of 
sweat on her upper lip. 
'‘Jacob, this is not the way. 
There must be something 
more. Lintz spoke of a foun- 
tain of bubbles, did he not?” 

"That’s right, but he might 
have been delirious.” 

“Not if he obtained enough 
gaseous oxygen to fill his suit 
— about a cubic foot, you said? 
To make such a difference, 
something would have to hap- 
pen to the fungus — presum- 
ably the female — before spor- 
ulation. Don’t you agree?” 

“Sounds likely. But what?” 
The pilaeus began to quiver. 

“I’m going to try some- 
thing.” She got down on her 
stomach, with her face close 
to the straining fungus. 

He watched tensely, and al- 
most shouted with surprise 
when she pouted her lips and 
caught the bubble as it pop- 
ped out. Holding his breath, 
he saw her turn aside and 
gently blow the bubble at the 
female ovoid, at the under- 
side, where the gill openings 
were. Amazingly, the bubble 
stuck, and dwindled rapidly, 
as if being sucked dry. Again, 
deftly, she caught a male bub- 
ble with her lips and served 
it to the hungry gills. 

She lay quite still. Standing 
over her, he stared down, rig- 
idly waiting. The purple ovoid 
swelled and swelled and shook 
— and suddenly, beautifully, 
spouted out a stream of huge, 
rainboAv-hued bubbles. Dozens 
— hundreds — the hot air was 



full of them, twinkling and 
bobbing — and bursting, filling 
his nostrils with heady per- 
fume. 

She squirmed over the hot 
soil to the last remaining 
pilaeus, and, as if waiting for 
her, it popped — and again she 
caught the fragile bubble on 
her rosy lips and blew it gen- 
tly to a waiting female. The 
second bubble she sent to an- 
other female, the third to yet 
another. 

T hen she scrambled to her 
feet and stood, with a shy, 
reserved smile, while volca- 
noes of bubbles spouted their 
scent around her. He caught 
a glimpse of her face and was 
transfixed by the sheer joy 
there. 

“Isn’t this just beautiful, 
Jacob?” She stretched out her 
arms and beat the cloud of 
rainbow globes into a whirling 
dance. 

He saw her as a Venus aris- 
ing from the sea-foam and 
laughed at the thought. 

She heard and echoed his 
laugh merrilv. “Aren’t they 
lovely?” 

“Very nearly as lovely as 
you, Susan.” He put out his 
arms to her and she came into 
them. “I’m probably a bit gid- 
dy with all this oxygen and 
exotic perfumes, but I don’t 
give a damn.” He held her 
close. “Susan, you’re the most 
wonderful thing that ever 
happened to me. Robot or not 
— who cares? — I want to have 



28 



JOHN RACKHAM 




you with me always. For me, 
you're as human as any real 
woman — ^and the only one I 
could ever get along with!" 

For this was the conclusion 
he had come to, in the quiet 
of his bunk, and the answer 
that logic had dictated, and 
now he had said it. 

‘‘But what about my free 
will, Jacob?" she asked, with 
a hint of mischief, as she nes- 
tled close. “You said I could 
do what I wished on my own 
time." 

“That's right!" He let go 
of her at once and stood back 
anxiously. “I'd forgotten all 
about that!" 

I N HIS distress he took a 
deeper breath than was 
wise, and coughed. The mix- 
ture of free oxygen, perfume 
and excess COo, plus the heat, 
all combined to give him a 
nightmare sense of urgent un- 
reality. It was as if a dream 
offered itself, just out of reach 
— and in between was this 
cursed business of definitions. 
And she wasn't helping any. 

She stood there, smiling, 
ever in a dream of drifting, 
opalescent bubbles — remote 
and unhumanly ideal. He 
made a great effort. 

“Susan, forgetting that you 
are anything other than just 
that — to me you are Susan, 
nothing more or less — I love 
you — will you — will you 
marry me?" 

She was immediately seri- 
ous, her blue eyes wide. Jar- 



ringly, he heard the approach 
alarm 

“What is it?” She tilted her 
head to listen. 

“Ship coming,” he said flat- 
ly, seeing his dream shattered 
into dust. “It’ll be here in 
about ten minutes.” 

“Why?” 

“Who knows?” He shrug- 
ged sagging shoulders. “A 
chance delivery, special mes- 
sage — anything. Dust your- 
self off as much as you can — 
we don’t want to lose any — 
collect a sample for fertility 
test — there’s not much doubt, 
but we have to check. I’ll go 
see who’s calling. I’ll send 
back the scooter, soon’s I get 
there. You run the sample to 
the lab room.” 

He turned and left the hot- 
house, slapping away as much 
of the dust as he could, before 
she could ask any further 
questions. He put the scooter 
into top speed and clung grim- 
ly as it raced along the corri- 
dors. He had lied. He knew, 
with dull certainty, who was 
calling and why. A year’s sal- 
ary to a pinch of spore dust 
that it was George Viner, 
come to check up on his 
gadget. 

As Jacob listened to the 
voice on the intercom, he knew 
he had won his hypothetical 
bet. No one would ever know 
just how much he had lost at 
the same time. He triggered 
the personal lock and went to 
shower. 

When he came back, pulling 

29 



IF YOU WISH 




a shirt down over his head, 
George Viner sat there, at 
ease, chewing on the end of 
an nnlighted cigar. Jacob 
thought, for the hundredth 
time, that he had never seen 
anyone who looked so like the 
typical professor — apart from 
that cigar. Against the white 
goatee, the pink complexion 
and the shaggy white eye- 
brows, the cigar added a rak- 
ish look. 

''Hello, George!'' Jacob 
perched a hip on the edge of 
the table. '‘Come to take her 
back, eh?" 

Viner echoed, then 
chuckled. “Oh, Susan, you 
mean. No, Jacob, my boy — not 
unless there is something 
wrong. Don't tell me some- 
thing is wrong already!" He 
poked his bullet-head for- 
ward, anxiously. 

“No, nothing wrong," said 
Jacob. “Just the reverse, in 
fact," 

y lNER took a fresh bite on 
his cigar. “Fine, fine. I'm 
on my way Earthside — couple 
or three things I want to bring 
up with the NSF and I'll be 
gone a good while — so I 
thought I'd look in on you, see 
how it goes. It's a bit early 
yet, I know. You haven't had 
time to get the thing trained 
up right, but it's something 
pretty new in the way of au- 
tomatics, and a snap report 
would help. I've plans afoot 
to make them an assembly 
line number, if they work out. 

30 



There's a future for general 
purpose mechanisms, I think. 
Anything outstanding?" 

Jacob shuddered. A mass- 
produced job! Thousands of 
Susans! General purpose ro- 
bots! A sudden awareness of 
what he had almost done 
shook him. 

“Did you have to make her 
so beautiful?" he demanded 
thickly. “And why make it a 
'her'? Was that necesary?" 

"Beautiful?" Viner seemed 
mildly surprised. “I suppose 
she is beautiful, come to think 
of it. But anything function- 
ally perfect is beautiful — like 
a mathematical theorem, a 
razor blade or a wheel. As for 
sex — I suppose it's natural 
that a man livihg all alone 
would attribute female traits 
— the way old-time sailors al- 
ways thought of their ships, 
for instance." 

He took out his cigar, look- 
ed at it thoughtfully, then re- 
inserted it. “But those aren't 
the kind of things I meant. 
Have you found anything that 
could do with improvement or 
modification, any faults or 
failures? On the other hand, is 
there anything you think you 
should know about replacing 
spares — batteries, program- 
ming — that sort of thing?" 

Jacob tried to think objec- 
tively, but all that would come 
through the inner fog of pain 
was a heart cry. 

"Did you have to teach her 
all that stuff about studying 
my Avishes — all that philos- 

JOHN RACKHAM 




ophy — keeping me happy- 
serving my pleasure — '' 

‘‘Jacob!'' Viner was on his 
feet now, like a stumpy, be- 
wildered Santa Claus. “You 
all right, son? Maybe you've 
been overdoing it a bit, eh? All 
this by your lonesome stuff is 
getting you down. Robots with 
philosophy!" He grew alarm- 
ed. “You find yourself talking 
to it?" 

“Hah!" Jacob was amused. 
“I talk to myself a lot, any- 
way, and never worried about 
it. It's the way the damned 
thing talks back to me!" 

Viner went back to his 
seat carefully — “boo carefully. 
Jacob could see the roboticist 
trying to appear casual. 

“Now, Jacob," Viner spoke 
soothingly, “don't get me 
wrong on this, understand, 
but I think it's about time you 
had a break. I'll put a call 
through to Ajax Base and 
we'll have somebody shipped 
out to take over — " 

“Jacob!" she came hurry- 
ing in, her lovely face aglow 
with excitement. “They’re 
fertile, sure enough — " Then 
she saw Viner and stopped in 
surprise and consternation. 
Suddenly aware of her nudity, 
she clutched vain hands, then 
turned and fled. 

Viner dropped his cigar and 
roared. “Susan! You come 
right back here!" 

H e was halfway out of his 
chair, purple with intent, 
when Jacob grabbed his arm. 



“What — " Jacob began. 

“That," Viner said through 
his teeth, “happens to be my 
niece, Susan Calvin, and I'd 
like to know just what the 
blazes she's doing here, and in 
that state — and, what's more, 
I intend to find out! Susan!" 

“Give her time to get some 
clothes on," Jacob said reason- 
ably. “Your niece, you said?" 
He was too totally shattered 
to be anything but devoid of 
all feeling. “Tell me about her, 
George." 

“You mean there's still 
something you don't know?" 

“There is. A lot. You see — " 
Jacob almost giggled at the 
silliness of it — “I thought she 
was the device you mentioned 
in your letter. You said 
‘Susan' and it — she — answer- 
ed to that, and I thought, nat- 
urally — ” 

“You mean you actually 
took that girl for a robot!? 
But that's fantastic! Nobody 
could be that dumb!" 

“Well, either I'm that dumb 
or she's a damn fine actress — 
or a bit of both. But I'm dumb, 
all right." Jacob nodded rue- 
fully. “I'm just beginning to 
realize how dumb. Tell me 
about her." 

“Well — " Viner ruminated, 
chewing the cigar. “She's a 
smart girl, all right, although 
I shouldn't say it. General 
sweep through biology and 
psychology, decided to major 
in sociology — personal rela- 
tionships, group and individ- 
ual dynamics — that line. She

IF YOU WISH 




works with me a lot on com- 
munication systems and the 
like — but what the hell am I 
doing, sitting here talking to 
you?'’ He got up violently. 
“Susan! Come right here!" 

She came in demurely, tug- 
ging a sweatshirt into place. 
Jacob could only stare. Some- 
how — now — there was a dif- 
ference. This was no longer 
an idealized dummy, but a 
living, breathing woman — 
and it was not the same. Com- 
mon sense tried to tell him 
that it was all his own imagi- 
nation, but it was no use. The 
shattered vacancy began to 
fill up, but the filling Was dust 
and ashes. Real flesh and 
blood — she was people! He 
slid from the table edge, hear- 
ing the rapid interchange be- 
tween uncle and niece as a 
vague, meaningless noise. He 
went out. 

He was staring unseeingb^ 
at the windowed Venus-scape, 
when he felt her touch on his 

arm. 

“Jacob." Her voice was 
soft. “Fm sorry I played a 
trick on you. Forgive me?" 

“For what?" he mumbled. 
“You had your fun. Or psy- 
chological experiment. Prove 
anything?" 

“Just that you're a very 
nice person — when you let 
yourself be — and that you're 
afraid of people without any 
reason. You know, you'd seen 
me a few times before — but 
you never noticed me. I want- 
ed you to — hence this," 



<^¥>EOPLE !” he said bitter- 

-T ly. “Sometimes I think 
it's a pity that Noah and his 
party didn't miss the boat!" 

“Mark Twain," she said. 

“All right, so you're smart. 
You fooled me. You made 
your point. Now would you 
please leave me alone?" 

“Does it make so much dif- 
ference, Jacob — my being hu- 
man? You said some very nice 
things to and about me, back 
there among the bubbles. I 
think you meant them. And 
you asked me a question, too. 
Don't you want my answer?" 

In the silence there came 
the muted trembling of the 
station as a ship blasted clear. 

“Iley!" he cried. “Tliat’s 
Viner, leaving. Why aren't 
you on that ship with him?" 

“Jacob O'Simon! You asked 
me to marry you! Uncle 
George has gone to bring back 
the padre from Ajax Base. 
Are you going to make a fool 
of me now?" 

“You made a fair fool of 
me!" he protested, “pretend- 
ing to be whatever I want- 
ed—" 

“I was not pretending, 
Jacob, then or now," she whis- 
pered. “I am whatever you 
want me to be. That's what a 
wife is for — to be whatever 
her man wants. Will you try 
me, Jacob?" 

“On one condition — that we 
go on just the way it was." 

She said, this time with 
emotion, “Whatever you wish, 
Jacob!" end

By MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 



Sam should have let the 22 



nixies go to the dead letter 



office . ,'or gone there him- 



self for sanctuary! 



O N HIS first day as a mail 
carrier, Sam Wilson no- 
ted that inscription, cribbed 
from Herodotus, on the Gen- 
eral Post Office, and took it to 
heart: “Not snow, nor rain, 
nor heat, nor gloom of night 
stays these couriers from the 
swift completion of their ap- 
pointed rounds.” 



It couldn’t be literally true, 
of course. Given a real bliz- 
zard, it would be impossible 
to make his way through the 
pathless drifts; and if there 
had been a major flood, he 
could hardly have swum to de- 
liver letters to the marooned. 
Moreover, if he couldn’t find 
the addressee, there was noth- 



33 




ing to do but mark the enve- 
lope “Not known at this ad- 
dress,” and take it back to be 
returned to the addresser or 
consigned to the Dead Letter 
Office. But through the years, 
Sam Wilson had been as con- 
sciously faithful and efficient 
as any Persian messenger. 

Now the long years had gal- 
loped by, and this was the 
very last time he would walk 
his route before his retire- 
ment. 

It would be good to put his 
feet up somewhere and ease 
them back into comfort; they 
had been Sam’s loyal servants 
and they were more worn out 
than he was. But the thought 
of retirement bothered him. 
Mollie was going to get sick 
of having him around the 
house all day, and he was 
damned if he was going to sit 
on a park bench like other dis- 
carded old men and suck a 
pipe and stare at nothing, 
waiting for the hours to pass 
in a vacuum. He had his big 
interest, of course — ^his status 
as a devoted science fiction 
fan ; he would have time now 
to read and reread, to watch 
hopefully from the roof of his 
apaltment house for signs of 
a flying saucer. But that 
wasn’t enough ; what he need- 
ed was a project to keep him 
alert and occupied. 

On his last delivery he 
found it. 

The Ochterlonie Building, 
way down on lower Second 
Avenue, was a rundown, shab- 

34 



by old firetrap, once as solid 
as the Scotsman who had built 
it and named it for himself, 
but now, with its single open- 
cage elevator and its sagging 
floors, attracting only quack 
doctors and dubious private 
eyes and similar fauna on the 
edge of free enterprise. Sam 
had been delivering to it now 
for 35 years, watching its 
slow deterioration. 

This time there was a 
whole batch of self-addressed 
letters for a tenant whose 
name was new to him, but 
that was hardly surprising — 
nowadays, in the Ochterlonie 
Building, tenants came and 
went. 

They were small envelopes, 
addressed in blue, in printing 
simulating handwriting, to 
Orville K. Hesterson, Sec.- 
Treas., Time-Between-Time, 
746 Ochterlonie Building, 
New York 3, N. Y. Feeling 
them with experienced fin- 
gers, Sam Wilson judged they 
were orders for something, 
doubtless enclosing money. 

I N MOST of the buildings on 
his last route, Sam knew, 
at least by sight, the em- 
ployees who took in the mail, 
and they knew him. A lot of 
them knew this was his last 
trip ; there were farewells 
and good wishes, and even a 
few small donations (since he 
wouldn’t be there next Christ- 
mas) which he gratefully 
tucked in an inside pocket of 
the uniform he would never 



MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORO 




wear again. There were also 
two or three invitations to a 
drink, which, being still on 
duty, he had regretfully to de- 
cline. 

But in the Ochterlonie 
Building, with its fly-by-night 
clientele, he was just the post- 
man, and nobody greeted him 
except Howie Mallory, the 
decrepit elevator operator. 
Sam considered him soberly. 
It was going to be pretty 
tough financially from now 
on; could he, perhaps, find a 
job like Howie’s? No. Not un- 
less things got a lot tougher; 
standing all day would be just 
as bad as walking. 

He went from office to office, 
getting rid of his load — most- 
ly bills* duns and complaints, 
he imagined, in this hole. 
There was nothing for the 
seventh floor except this 
bunch for Time-Between- 
Time. 

The seventh floor? He must 
be nuts. The Ochterlonie 
Building was six floors high. 

Puzzled, he rang for Howie. 

“What’d they do, build a 
penthouse office on top of this 
old dump?” he inquired. 

The elevator operator 
laughed as at a feeble jest. 
“Sure,” he said airily. “Gen- 
eral Motors is using it as a 
hideaway.” 

“No, Howie — no fooling. 
Look here.” 

Mallory stared and shook 
his head. “There ain’t no 746. 
Somebody got the number 
wrong. Or they got the build- 

36 



ing wrong. There’s nobody 
here by that name.” 

“They couldn’t — printed 
envelopes like these.” 

“0. K., wise guy,” said 
Howie. “Look for yourself.” 
He led the way to the short 
flight of iron stairs and the 
trap door. While Mallory 
stood jeering at him, Sam de- 
terminedly climbed through. 
There was nothing in sight 
but the plain flat roof. He 
climbed down again. 

“Last letters on my last de- 
livery and I can’t deliver 
them,” Sam Wilson said dis- 
gustedly. 

“Somebody’s playing a joke, 
maybe.” 

“Crazy joke. Well, so long, 
Howie. Some young squirt 
will be taking his life in his 
hands in this broken-down 
cage of yours tomorrow.” 
Sam Wilson, whom nothing 
could deter from the swift 
completion of his appointed 
rounds, had to trudge back to 
the post office with 22 unde- 
livered letters. 

Years ago the United States 
Post Office gave up searching 
directories and reference 
books, or deciphering illiter- 
ate or screwy addresses, so as 
to make every possible deliv- 
ery. That went out with three 
daily and two Saturday deliv- 
eries, two-cent drop postage, 
and all the other amenities 
that a submissive public let 
itself lose without a protest. 
But there was still a city di- 
rectory in the office. Sam Wil- 

MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 




son searched it stubbornly. 
Time-Between-Time was not 
listed. Neither was Orville K. 
Hesterson. 

There was nothing to do 
but consider the letters nixies 
and turn them over to the 
proper department. If there 
was another bunch of them 
tomorrow, he would never 
know. 

ETIREMENT, after the 
first carefree week, was 
just as bad as Sam Wilson 
had suspected it was going to 
be. Not bad enough to think 
yet about elevator operating 
or night watching, but bad 
enough to make him restless 
and edg>% and to make him 
snap Mollie’s head off until 
they had their first bad quar- 
rel for years. He’d never had 
time enough before to keep up 
with all the science fiction 
magazines and books. Now, 
with nothing but time, there 
weren’t enough of them to fill 
the long days. What he need- 
ed was something — something 
that didn’t involve walking — 
to make those endless hours 
speed up. He began thinking 
again about those 22 nixies. 

He sat gloomily on a bench 
in Tompkins Square in the 
spring sunshine : just what he 
had swoni not to do, but if he 
stayed home another hour, 
Mollie would heave the vac- 
uum cleaner at him. In the 
public library he had search- 
ed directories and phone 
books, for all the 'ooroughs 

NOT SNOW NOR RAIN 



and for suburban New Jer- 
sey, Connecticut and Pennsyl- 
vania; Orville K. Hesterson 
appeared in none of them. 

He didn’t know why it was 
any of his business, except 
that Time-Between-Time had 
put a blot on the very end of 
his 35-year record and he 
wanted revenge. Also, it was 
something to do and be inter- 
ested in. In a way, science fic- 
tion and detection had a lot 
in common, and Sam Wilson 
prided himself on his ability 
to guess ahead what was go- 
ing to happen in a story. So 
why couldn’t he figure out 
this puzzle, right here in 
Manhattan, Terra? But he 
was stymied. 

Or was he? 

Sam took his gloomy 
thoughts to Mulligan’s. Every 
large city is a collection of 
villages. The people who live 
long enough in a neighbor- 
hood acquire their own gro- 
ceries, their own drugstores, 
their own bars. The Wilsons 
had lived six years in their 
flat, and Mulligan’s, catercor- 
nered across the street, was 
Sam’s personal bar. 

He was cautious as to 
what he said there. He’d 
heard enough backtalk al- 
ready when he had been in- 
discreet enough once, after 
four beers, to express his 
views on UFOs. He had no 
desire to gain a reputation as 
a crackpot. But it was safe 
enough to remark conversa- 
tionally, “How do you find out 

37 





where a guy is when he says 
he’s someplace and you write 
him there and the letter comes 
back?” 

“You ought to know, Sam,” 
said Ed, the day barkeep. 
“You were a postman long 
enough.” 

“If I knew, I wouldn’t ask.” 

“Ask Information on the 
phone.” 

“He hasn’t got a phone.” 
That was the weirdest part of 
it — a business office without a 
phone. 

In every bar, at every mo- 
ment, there is somebody who 
knows all the answers. This 
somebody, a nondescript fel- 
low nursing a Collins down 
the bar, spoke up: “It could 
be unlisted.” 

Sam’s acquaintance didn’t 
include people with unlisted 
phones; he hadn’t thought of 
that. 

“Then how do you find out 
his number?” 

“You don’t, unless he tells 
you. That’s why he has it un- 
listed.” 

The police could get it, Sam 
thought. But they wouldn’t, 
without a reason. 

“Hey, maybe this guy’s of- 
fice is in one of them flying 
saucers and he forgot to come 
down and get his mail,” Ed 
suggested brightly. 

Sam scowled and walked 
out. 

Nevertheless . 

Nothing to do with UFOs, 
of course. That was ridicu- 
lous, 

38 



B ut suppose there was a 
warp in the space-time 
continuum? Suppose there 
had once been another Ochter- 
lonie Building, or some day in 
the future there was going to 
be another one, somewhere in 
New York? There wasn’t an- 
other now, in any of the bor- 
oughs, or any other building 
with a name remotely like it; 
his research had already es- 
tablished that. 

Sam went back to the Pub- 
lic Library. The building he 
knew had been erected in 
1898. He consulted directories 
as far back as they went; 
there never had been one of 
the name before. Then a time- 
slip from the future? 

That was hopeless, so far as 
he could do anything about it, 
so he cast about for another 
solution. How about a parallel 
world ? 

That could be, certainly : 
some accident by which mail 
for that other Ochterlonie 
Building, the seven-story one, 
had (maybe just once) arriv- 
ed in the wrong dimension. 

He couldn’t do anything to 
prove or disprove that, either. 
What he needed was a break. 
He got it. 

One morning in early sum- 
mer his own mailbox in the 
downstairs hallway disgorged 
a long envelope, addressed to 
Mr. Samuel Wilson. The up- 
per left-hand corner bore a 
printed return address : Time- 
Between-Time, 746 Ochter- 
lonie Building, New York 3, 

MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 




N. Y. He raced upstairs, lock- 
ed himself in the bathroom, 
the one place Mollie couldn't 
interrupt him, and tore the 
envelope open with trembling 
lingers. 

It was a form letter, with 
the ''Dear Mr. Wilson" not 
too accurately typed in. It en- 
closed one of those blue-print- 
ed envelopes in simulated 
handwriting. The letterhead 
carried the familiar impos- 
sible address, but no phone 
number. 

Maybe it was chance, may- 
be it was ESP, but he him- 
self had got onto Time-Be- 
tween-Time's mailing list! 

H e had trouble focusing 
his eyes to read the letter. 

Dear Mr. Wilson : 

Would you invest $1 to 
get a chance at $1,000? 

Of course you would, 
especially if, win or lose, 
you got your dollar back. 

In this atomic age, yes- 
terday’s science fiction has 
become today’s and tomor- 
row’s science fact. Time- 
Between-Time, a new^ or- 
ganization, is planning 
establishment of a publish- 
ing company to bring out 
the best in new books, both 
fact and fiction, in the field 
of science, appealing to 
people who have never been 
interested until now. 

Before we start, w'e are 
conducting a poll to find out 
what the general public 



thinks and feels about our 
probabilities of success. 
We’re asking for your co- 
operation. 

Our statisticians have told 
us that from the answers 
to one question — which may 
look off the beam but isn’t 
— we can make a pretty 
good estimate. Here it is: 

If tomorrow morning a 
spaceship landed in front 
of your house, and from it 
issued a band of extrater- 
restrial beings, who might 
or might not be human in 
appearance, what, in your 
best judgment, would be 
your own immediate reac- 
tion? Check one, or if you 
agree with none of the 
choices, indicate in the 
blank space beneath what 
your personal reaction 
w^ould probably be. 

1. Phone for the police. 
2. Attack the aliens physical- 
ly. 3. Faint. 4. Run away. 5. 
Call for assistance to seize 
the visitors. 6. Greet them, 
attempt to communicate, 
and welcome them in the 
name of your fellow-terres- 
trials. 7. Other (please 
specify). 

Return this letter, prop- 
erly marked, in the enclosed 
envelope. To defray promo- 
tion expenses, enclose a dol- 
lar bill (no checks or money 
orders). 

At the conclusion of this 
poll, all answ^ers will be 
evaluated. The writer of the 
one which comes nearest to 



NOT SNOW NOR RAIN 



39 




the answer reached by our 
electronic computer, which 
will be fed the same ques- 
tion, will receive $1,000 in 
dollar bills. Ties will re- 
ceive duplicate prizes. 

In addition, all partici- 
pants, when our publishing 
firm has been established, 
will receive for their $1 a 
credit form entitling them 
to $1 off any book we pub- 
lish. 

Don’t delay. Send in your 
answer NOW. Only letters 
enclosing $1 will be entered. 

Very truly yours, 
Time-Between-Time, 
Orville K. Hesterson, 
Sec.-Treas. 

S AM WILSON read the let- 
ter three times. “It’s 
crazy,” he muttered. “It’s a 

gyp.” 

What he ought to do was 
take the letter to the post of- 
fice — Mr. Gross would be the 
one to see — and let them de- 
cide whether this Hesterson 
was using the mails to de- 
fraud. Let Mr. Gross and his 
department try to find 746 
in the six-story Ochterlonie 
Building. As a faithful em- 
ployee for 35 years, it was 
Sam’s plain duty. 

But then it would be out of 
his hands forever; he’d never 
even find out what happened. 
And he’d be back in the dull 
morass that retirement Avas 
turning out to be. 

“Sam!” Mollie yelled out- 
side the locked door. “Aren’t 

40 



you ever coming out of 
there?” 

“I’m coming. I’m coming!” 
He put the letter and its en- 
closure back in the envelope 
and placed them in a pocket. 

Time enough to decide that 
afternoon what he Avas going 
to do. 

He escaped after lunch to 
Avhat was becoming his refuge 
on a park bench. There he 
read the letter for the fourth 
time. For a long while he sat 
ruminating. About three 
o’clock he Avalked to the Gen- 
eral Post Office — walking had 
become a habit hard to break 
— and hunted up the man Avho 
now had his old route, a 
youngster not more than 30 
named Flanagan. 

From the letter Sam ex- 
tracted the return envelope. 

“You been delivering any 
like this?” he asked. 

Flanagan peered at it. 

“Yeah,” he said. “Plenty.” 
He looked worried. “Gee, Wil- 
son, I’m glad you came in. 
There’s something funny 
a^ut those deliveries, and I 
don’t want to get in Dutch.” 

“Funny how?” 

“My very first day on the 
route, I started up to the sev- 
enth floor of that building 
to deliver them — and there 
Avasn’t any seventh floor. So I 
asked the old elevator man—” 

“Howie Mallory. I know 
him. He’s been there for 
years.” 

“I guess so. AnyAvay, he 
said it Avas 0. K. just to give 

MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 




them to him. He showed me 
a paper, signed with the 
name of this outfit, by the 
secretary or something — ” 

“Orville K. Hesterson,” 
Sam said. 

“That was it — saying that 
all mail for them was to be 
delivered to the elevator oper- 
ator until further notice. So 
I’ve been giving it to him ever 
since — there’s a big bunch 
every day. Is something 
wrong, Sam? Have I pulled a 
boner? Am I going to be in 
trouble ?’’ 

“No trouble. I’m just 
checking — little job they ask- 
ed me to do for them, seeing 
I’m retired.” Sam was sur- 
prised at the glibness with 
which that fib came out. 

Flanagan looked still more 
worried. “He said their office 
was being remodeled or some- 
thing, so he was looking after 
their mail till they could move 
in.” 

“Sure. Don’t give it another 
thought.” Another idea oc- 
curred to him ; he lowered his 
voice. “I oughtn’t to tell you 
this, Flanagan, but every new 
man on a route, they kind of 
check up on him the first few 
weeks, see if he’s handling 
everything O.K. I’ll tell them 
you’re doing fine.” 

“Hey, thanks. Thanks a 
lot.” 

“Don’t say anything about 
this. It’s supposed to be se- 
cret.” 

“Oh, I won’t.” 

Sam Wilson waved and 

NOT SNOW NOR RAIN 



walked out. He sat on the 
steps a while to think. 

Was old Howie Mallory 
pulling a fast one? Was he 
Orville K. Hesterson? Had he 
cooked up a scheme to make 
himself some crooked money ? 

T hree things against that. 

First, those nixies the 
first day: why wouldn’t Mal- 
lory have told him the same 
thing he told Flanagan? Sam 
would have believed him, if 
he had said they were build- 
ing an office on the roof and 
giving it a number. 

Second, Howie just wasn’t 
smai't enough. Of course he 
could be fronting for the real 
crook. But Sam had known 
him for years, and old Howie 
had always seemed downright 
stupidly honest. A man does- 
n’t suddenly turn into a crim- 
inal after a lifetime of probity. 

Third, if this was some 
fraudulent scheme involving 
Mallory, nobody the old man 
knew — least of all the post- 
man who used to deliver mail 
to that very building — would 
ever have been allowed to ap- 
pear on the sucker list. 

Sam Wilson thought some 
more. Then he hunted up the 
nearest pay phone and called 
Mollie. 

“Mollie? Sam. Look, I just 
met an old friend of mine — ” 
he picked a name from a bill- 
board visible from the phone 
booth — “Bill Seagram, you 
remember him — oh, sure you 
do; you’ve just forgotten. 



41 




Anyway, he’s just here for 
the day and we’re going to 
have dinner and see a show. 
Don’t wait up for me. I might 
be pretty late ... No, I’m not 
phoning from Mulligan’s . 
Now you know me, Mollie; do 
I ever drink too much? . 
Yeah, sure, he ought to’ve 
asked you too, but he didn’t. 
O.K., he’s impolite. Aw, Mol- 
lie, don’t be like that — ” 

She hung up on him. 

Sam Wilson stood concealed 
in a doorway from which he 
could see the cramped lobby 
of the Ochterlonie Building. 
It was ten minutes before 
somebody entered it and rang 
for the elevator. The minute 
Howie Mallory started up 
with his passenger, Sam dart- 
ed into the building and 
started climbing the stairs. 
He heard Mallory passing 
him, going down again, but 
the elevator wasn’t visible 
from the stairway. On the 
sixth floor, after a quick sur- 
vey to see that the hall was 
clear and the doors closed 
that he had to pass, he found 
the iron steps to the trapdoor. 

The roof was just as empty 
as the other time he had visit- 
ed it. No, it wasn’t. In a cor- 
ner by the parapet, weighted 
with a brick to keep it from 
blowing away, was a large 
paper bag. Sam picked up the 
brick and looked inside. It 
was stuffed with those blue- 
printed return envelopes. 

He looked carefully about 
him. There were buildings all 

42 



around, towering over the 
little old Ochterlonie Build- 
ing. There were plenty of 
windows from which a cu- 
rious eye could discern any- 
thing happening on that roof. 
But at night anybody in those 
buildings would be either 
working late or cleaning of- 
fices, with no reason whatever 
to go to a window; and Sam 
was sure nothing was going 
to happen till after dark. 

It was a warm day and he 
had been carrying his coat. 
He folded it and put it down 
near the paper bag and sat on 
it with his back against the 
parapet. He cursed himself 
for not having had more 
foresight; he should have 
brought something to eat and 
something to read. Well, he 
wasn’t going to climb down all 
those stairs and up again. He 
lighted his pipe and began 
waiting. 

He must have dozed off, for 
he came to himself v/ith a 
start and found it was almost 
dark. The paper bag was still 
there. It was just as well he 
had slept; now he’d have no 
trouble staying awake and 
watching. He might very well 
be there all night — in fact, 
he’d have to be, whether any- 
thing happened or not. The 
front door would be locked by 
now. Mollie would have a fit, 
but he had his alibi ready. 

There was only one ex- 
planation left. Not time 
travel. Not alternate univers- 
es. Not an ordinary confi- 

MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 




dence game. Not — decidedly 
not — a hoax. 

If he was wrong, then to- 
morrow morning he’d take the 
whole business to Mr. Gross. 
But he had a huneh he wasn’t 
going to be wrong. 

T WAS 12:15 by his wrist- 
watch when he saw it com- 
ing. 

It had no lights; nobody 
could have spotted it as it ap- 
peared suddenly out of no- 
where and climbed straight 
down. It landed lightly as a 
drop of dew. The port opened 
and a small, spare man, very 
neatly dressed, as Sam could 
see with eyes accustomed to 
the darkness, stepped out. Or- 
ville K. Hesterson in person. 

He tiptoed quickly to the 
paper bag. Then he saw Sam 
and stopped short. Sam reach- 
ed out and grabbed a wrist. 
It felt like flesh, but he 
couldn’t be sure. 

“Who are you? What are 
you doing here?’’ the new- 
comer said in a strained whis- 
per, just like a scared charac- 
ter in a soap opera. So he 
spoke English. Good : Sam 
didn’t speak anything else. 

“I’m from the United States 
Post Office,” Sam replied 
suavely. Well, he had been, 
long enough, hadn’t he? 

“Oh. Well, now look, my 
friend — ” 

“You look. Talk. How much 
are you paying the elevator 
operator to put your mail up 
here every day?” 

NOT SNOW NOR RAIN 



“Five dollars a day, in dol- 
lar bills, six days a week, left 
in the empty bag,” answered 
Hesterson — it must be Hes- 
terson — sullenly. “That’s no 
crime, is it? Call this my of- 
fice, and call that my rent. All 
I need an office for is to have 
somewhere to get my letters.” 
“Letters with money in 
them.” 

“We have to have funds for 
postage, don’t we?” 

“What about the postage 
on the first mailing list, be- 
fore you got any dollars to 
pay for stamps?” 

If it had been a little light- 
er, Sam would have been sur- 
er of the alarm that crossed 
Hesterson’s face. 

“I — well, we had to fabri- 
cate some of your currency 
for that. We regretted it — ^w'e 
aim to obey all local rules and 
regulations. As soon as we 
have enough coming in, we in- 
tend to send the amount to 
the New York postmaster 
as anonymous conscience 
money.” 

“How about the $1,000 
prize? And those dollar book 
credits 

“Oh, that. Well, we say 
‘ivhen our publishing firm 
has been established,’ don’t 
we? That publishing thing is 
just a gimmick. As for the 
$1,000, we give no intimation 
of when the poll will end.” 
Sam tightened his grasp on 
the wrist, which was begin- 
ning to wriggle. 

“I see. O.K., explain the 

43 




whole setup. It sounds crazy 
to me.” 

“I couldn’t agree with you 
more,” said Mr. Hesterson, to 
Sam’s surprise. “That’s exact- 
ly what, in our own idiom, I 
told — ” Sam couldn’t get the 
name ; it sounded like a grunt. 
“But he’s the boss and I’m 
only a scout third class.” His 
voice grevy plaintive. “You 
can’t imagine what an ordeal 
it is, almost every week, to 
have to land in a secluded 
place where I can hide the fly- 
er, make my way to New 
York, and buy a bunch of 
stamps and mail a batch of 
letters in broad daylight. We 
can simulate your paper and 
printing and typing well 
enough, but” — that grunt 
again — “insists we use genu- 
ine stamps. I told you we try 
to follow all your laws, as far 
as we possibly can. It’s very 
difficult for me to keep this 
absurd shape for long at a 
time; I’m exhausted after 
every trip. I can assure you, 
these little night excursions 
from the mother-ship to pick 
up the letters are the very 
least of my burdens!” 

“What in time does your 
boss think he’s going to gain 
by such a screwy come-on?” 

“ Tn time’? Oh, just an 
idiomatic phrase. Like our 
calling our organization Time- 
Between-Time, time of course 
being just a dimension of 
space. I learned your tongue 
mostly from the B.B.C. and I 
don’t always understand your

speech in New York. My 
dear sir, do you here on this 
planet ask your bosses why 
they concoct their plans? 
Mine has a very profound 
mind; that’s why he is the 
boss. All I know is that he 
persuaded the Council to try 
it out. A softening-up proc- 
ess — isn’t that what you peo- 
ple call it when you use it in 
your silly wars with one an- 
other ?” 

“Softening for what?” But 
Sam Wilson knew the answer 
already. 

«"^^HY, for the invasion, 

^ of course,” said Orville 
K. Hesterson, whose own 
name was probably a grunt. 
“Surely you must be aware 
that, with planetwide devas- 
tation likely and even immi- 
nent, every world whose 
inhabitants can live comfort- 
ably under extreme radiation 
is looking to yours- — Earth, as 
you call it — as a possible area 
for colonization? So many 
planets are so terribly over- 
crowded — there’s always a 
rush for a new frontier. 
We’ve missed out too often; 
this time we’re determined to 
be first.” 

“I’ll be darned,” said Sam, 
“if I can see how that ques- 
tionnaire would be any help 
to you.” 

“But it’s elementary, as I 
believe one of your famous 
law-enforcers once declared. 
First of all, we’re gaining a 
pretty good idea of what kind 

MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 




of reception we’re likely to 
meet when we arrive, and 
therefore whether we’re go- 
ing to need weapons to de- 
stroy what will be left of the 
population, or can reasonably 
expect to take over without 
difficulty. We figure that a 
cross-section of one of your 
largest cities will be a pretty 
good indication, and we can 
extrapolate from that. In the 
second place, the question it- 
self is deliberately worded to 
startle the recipients, who 
have never in their lives con- 
templated such a thing as an 
extraterrestrial visitor — ” 

“Not me. I’m a science fic- 
tion fan from way back. It’s 
all old stuff to me.’’ 

Hesterson clicked his 
tongue — or at least the tongue 
he was wearing. “Oh, dear, 
that tvas an error. We tried 
particularly not to include on 
our lists subscribers to any of 
your speculative periodicals. 
That wasn’t my mistake, 
thank goodness ; it was anoth- 
er scout who had the horrible 
job of spending several days 
here and compiling the lists. 
Under your present low radio- 
activity it’s real agony for 
us.” 

“I’ll tell you one mistake 
you did make, though,” said 
Sam angrily. “You ought 
to’ve arranged with the ele\ a- 
tor man before your first lot 
of answers was due. If you 
want to know, that’s ho\\' I 
got onto the whole thing. I’m 
a mail carrier — I’m retired 



now, but I was then — ^and I 
was the one supposed to de- 
liver the first batch. Mallory 
— that’s the elevator operator 
— laughed in my face and told 
me there wasn’t any 746 in 
this building, and I had to 
take the letters back to the 
post office — on my last deliv- 
ery!” Sam couldn’t keep the 
bitterness out of his voice. 
“After 35 years — well, that’s 
neither here nor there. But I 
didn’t like that and I made up 
my mind to find out what was 
happening.” 

“So that’s it. Oh, dear, 
dear. I’ll have to compensate 
for that or I will be in trou- 
ble.” 

Sam had had enough. “You 
are in trouble right now,” he 
growled, pushing the little 
alien back against the para- 
pet. “We’re staying right here 
till morning, and then I’m go- 
ing to call for help and take 
you and your flying saucer or 
whatever it is straight to the 
F.B.I.” 

The counterfeit Mr. Hes- 
terson laughed. 

“Oh, no indeed you aren’t,” 
he said mildly. “I can slip 
right back into my own shape 
whenever I want to — the only 
reason I haven’t done it yet is 
that then I wouldn’t have the 
equipment to talk to you — and 
1 assure you that you couldn’t 
hold me then. On the con- 
trary. As you just pointed out 
to me, I did make one bad 
error, and my boss doesn’t 
like errors. I have no inten- 



NOT SNOW NOR RAIN

tion of making another one by 
leaving you here to spread the 
news.” 

‘'What do you mean?” Sam 
Wilson cried. For the first 
time, after the years of accus- 
tomedness to the idea of ex- 
traterrestrial beings, a thrill 
of pure terror shot through 
him, 

“This,” said the outsider 
softly. 

B efore Sam could take 
another breath, the wrist 
he was holding slid from his 
grasp, all of Mr. Hesterson 
slithered into something ut- 
terly beyond imagining, and 
Sam found himself enveloped 
in invisible chains against 
which he was unable to make 
the slightest struggle. He felt 
himself being lifted and 



thrown into the cockpit. 
Something landed on top of 
him — undoubtedly the pack- 
age of prize entries and dol- 
lar bills. His last conscious 
thought was a despairing one 
of Mollie. 

Sam Wilson, devoted mail 
carrier, was making a longer 
trip than any Persian courier 
ever dreamed of, and not 
snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor 
gloom of night could stay him 
from his appointed round. 

But he may not be gone for- 
ever. If he can be kept alive 
on that planet in some other 
solar system, they plan to 
bring him back as Exhibit 
One whenever World War III 
has made Earth sufficiently 
radioactive for Orville K. 
Hesterson’s co-planetarians to 
live here comfortably. END 



DANGER! 

Without taking a single person into space, amateur-launched rockets are 
causing a greater proportion of casualties than car accidents: 162 versus 
22 per 10,000. Alarmed by this rate, the American Rocket Society de- 
clares that *^all practical means must be taken to prevent the manufac- 
ture of propellants of rockets by amateurs,’^ urges bans on the sale of 
such fuels, and adds that the launching of rockets by amateurs must be 
prohibited, ^‘The somewhat debatable loss in opportunity for intellectual 
development which might be suffered by foregoing experimentation,’’ 
says Col. John P. Stapp, ARS president, ‘"is small compared with appar- 
ently unavoidable and appalling loss of eyes, fingers and lives.”

As mean a vengeance as was 
ever devised — or a super- 
human sacrifice — which was 
it to be? . 



day,” said Gervais 
w savagely, “I’m going. to 
take a knife and stick it right 
into Wendle’s gizzard.” 

“And twist it.” Frobisher 
didn’t like Captain Wendle 
any more than Gervais did. 

“And twist it,” agreed 
Gervais. “Slowly.” 

He was a chunky young 
man with a shock of unruly 
hair and a normally cheerful 
expression. Now his expres- 
sion was far from cheerful. 
He flung himself into a chair 



and stared moro’sely at the 
beautiful flight pattern over 
which he had taken so much 
trouble. 

Frobisher lit a cigarette. 
“All right,” he said gently. 
“What is it this time?” 

“Need you ask?” Gervais 
was bitter. “So Wendle is the 
king-sized brain-boy. So he is 
in command of this tub. So he 
should know what he’s talk- 
ing about.” His voice rose as 
he thought about it. “But 
does he have to ram his su- 



47 




periority down my throat 
every chance he gets?” 

“He does not,” said Fro- 
bisher. 

“Then why does he?” Ger- 
vais crumpled the flight pat- 
tern to a small ball of waste 
paper. “Wrong,” he said. 
“The course could be short- 
ened by a good thirty min- 
utes. I’m a fifth decimal point 
out in my calculations.” 
Frobisher made appropri- 
ate noises, trying hard not to 
smile. Wendle might be all 
manner of a you-know-what, 
but he did know his business. 
If Gervais had muffed the 
flight pattern, then he should- 
n’t beef about having his 
knuckles rapped. Frobisher 
didn’t tell his crewmate that. 
He wanted to avoid blood- 
shed. His own. 

“Never mind,” he soothed. 
“It happens to us all. Don’t 
let it worry you.” 

Gervais made rude noises. 
“Personally,” continued 
Frobisher, “I don’t mind ad- 
mitting my errors. I like to 
think that I’m man enough to 
accept correction.” 

“That’s big of j^ou.” Ger- 
vais was sarcastic. “Mightv 
big.” 

H e would have said more 
but the door opened just 
then and Captain Wendle en- 
tered the chart room. He was 
a well-built man who wore 
his impeccable uniform like a 
second skin. His expression 
was his normal one, as if he 



smelled a bad odor in his im- 
mediate vicinity. 

“Frobisher!” His voice 
matched the rest of him. Cold, 
distant, acidly correct. 

“Sir!” Frobisher leaped to 
his feet, snapping a salute. 
Wendle might be the original 
son of a female dog but he 
was still the captain. On his 
reports depended promotion. 

“Frobisher, tell me, what is 
the optimum operating tem- 
perature of our pile?” said 
Captain Wendle. 

Frobisher told him. 

“Are you certain? Should- 
n’t it be just a little higher? 
Say a degree and a half high- 
er?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Then why is it that the 
gauges in the control room 
show that the temperature is 
higher than the one you have 
stated ? Or could it be that the 
gauge is faulty?” 

“We have a ten-degree tol- 
erance, sir.” 

“I am aware of that. I am 
also aware that you are pur- 
ported to be an engineer. You 
have given me the figure for 
optimum temperature. Opti- 
mum working, Frobisher, is 
what I demand on my vessel.” 

“Yes, sir. I’m sorry, sir.” 
Frobisher looked ready to 
burst. 

Wendle stared at him as if 
he were a clinical specimen. 
“Sorry, Frobisher? I think 
not. You are annoyed that I 
have discovered your ineffi- 
ciency, but being annoyed is 



48 



TED BAIN 




not being sorry.” Wendle 
swivled his eyes to Gervais. 
“Have you rectified your 
error, Gervais?” 

“Just working on it, sir.” 

“You may save your labor 
and my patience. I have re- 
ceived a communication from 
Base. We have been reas- 
signed.” 

“Sir?” said Gervais. 

“To an uncharted world. I 
will give you the coordinates 
later so that you may make 
an attempt to chart a flight 
pattern.” 

“Yes, sir. The mission, 
sir?” 

“A rescue party.” Wendle 
stepped toward the door. “If 
you are doubtful as to what 
that is, I suggest that you look 
up the word in a dictionary. 
There are, I understand, sev- 
eral aboard.” 

The door closed behind 
him. Frobisher let out his 
breath in a long, low, obscen- 
ity-filled hiss. 

It was Gervais’s turn to 
make appropriate noises. 

T he world was a twin of 
Earth in that it had seas, 
mountains, continents and 
vegetation. It also had a 
breathable atmosphere and, 
according to Wendle’s infor- 
mation, a party that needed 
rescuing. 

“Base picked up a sub- 
etheric message,” he explain- 
ed. “It gave the coordinates 
and asked for a ship to make 
contact. That means rescue, 

GOOD-BY, GLORIA 



of course.” His finger tapped 
a photomap. “You’ll find them 
down there. We’ve pinpointed 
their transmitter.” 

“Them?” said Gervais. 
“Yes, Gervais, them.” Wen- 
dle was patient. “Surely you 
do not imagine that a single 
individual could have operat- 
ed the transmitter?” 

“Why not, sir?” 

“Because Base has checked 
records and no ship has been 
missing for over twenty 
years. Obviously a ship was 
wrecked here and the surviv- 
ors have taken all this time 
to organize themselves.” His 
tone implied that, had he been 
with the survivors, they 
would have done it much 
sooner. 

“Your mission,” he con- 
tinued, “is to go down, survey 
the party and report back to 
me. I will decide on appro- 
priate action.” 

“Yes, sir.” Gervais knew 
what that meant. Sometimes 
survivors of wrecked space- 
ships were best left alone. 
Disease and reversion to bar- 
barism could produce some 
highly undesirable character- 
istics. 

“Frobisher will go with 
you. You will take a scout 
ship and remain in constant 
communication with us as we 
orbit.” Wendle rolled up the 
map and handed it over. “Is 
there anything more? Any 
point on which you are in 
doubt?” His tone defied them 
to admit ignorance. 



49 




Frobisher complained about 
it on the way down to the 
planet. 

“Wendle is a good man,” he 
said, “I’ll give him that. Top 
marks at everything he does 
and all that. So why does he 
act as if we had holes in the 
head?” 

“He can’t help it.” Gervais 
checked the controls. The tiny 
scout was heading to where 
it should go. “Maybe it’s be- 
cause of an inferiority com- 
plcx,^^ 

“Inferiority?” 

“In a way. He has to keep 
proving himself.” 

“Why?” 

“Because he has to, that’s 
why.” 

“As a psychologist, you 
make a good jet man,” snort- 
ed Frobisher. “Inferiority 
complex! If Wendle has that, 
then I’m a green painted 
fairy. The trouble with that 
guy is that he considers him- 
self to be superior to every 
other member of the human 
race.” 

“Maybe you’re right,” Ger- 
vais conceded. 

Frobisher glowered at the 
control panel. “I know I’m 
right. As far as we’re con- 
cerned, he regards us as mor- 
ons. You can tell it every time 
he opens his mouth. The trou- 
ble is that when I’m with him 
I begin to feel like one. Then 
I begin to act like one. And 
the longer I’m with him, the 
worse it gets.” 

It was true, Gervais had to 

50 



admit. Neither he nor Fr(> 
bisher was really dumb; it 
was just that against Wendle 
they felt that way. Little 
errors were made to seem 
more important than they 
really were. And the worst 
part of it was that Wendle 
was always right. Never once, 
in all the time they had 
known him, had he appeared 
other than perfect. 

Gervais frowned at the 
planet below. Away from 
Wendle’s irritating presence, 
he found it possible to be 
charitable. In a way he felt 
sorry for the captain. None 
of the crew liked him. He was 
never able to relax, to enjoy 
a drink, to let his hair down, 
to laugh off his own failures. 
He always had to be proving 
himself better than the next 
man. Even at sports he was 
unbeatable. At least, at the 
sports he ever played. Gervais 
had a shrewd idea that Wen- 
dle wouldn’t join in any ac- 
tivity at which he wasn’t a 
master. 

H e forgot Wendle in the 
fuss of landing. The ship 
bumped a couple of times, 
then came to rest on a more 
or less even keel. Frobisher 
rubbed a couple of bruises, 
said something pungent about 
bum landings and buckled on 
his gear while Gervais report- 
ed back to the mother ship. 
He was waiting outside when 
Gervais joined him. 

“Well?” asked Frobisher. 



TED BAIN 




“We head for the site of the 
radio beacon/' Gervais point- 
ed vaguely south. “It can't be 
far." 

“Depends on what you 
mean by far." Frobisher 
checked the pistol in his belt. 
“That undergrowth could 
hide things." 

“Nothing big enough to 
hurt you." 

“No?" Frobisher didn't 
sound too sure. “Maybe I’d 
better stand by the radio 
while you find the survivors. 
Wendle did order us to remain 
in contact, remember." 

“I've arranged that. We 
can report back on portable 
radio to the scout and an au- 
tomatic relay will pass it on 
to the ship." Gervais sucked 
in a deep breath of fresh air. 
“I wouldn’t have liked to send 
you into unknown dangers 
without your friend and, in- 
cidentally, senior officer, at 
your side." 

Frobisher sighed and fol- 
lowed him south. 

I can't under- 

^ stand," Frobisher said 
after an hour's hard going, 
“is why we just didn't wait at 
the scout for them to come to 
us. They must have seen us 
land." 

“Possibly." Gervais gently 
eased a large, many-legged in- 
sect from beneath his collar. 
He stared at it with morbid 
interest. It bit him and he 
dropped it with a shudder. 

“Then why couldn't we 

GOOD-BY, GLORIA 



have waited?" Frobisher step- 
ped carefully over a log and 
cursed as his foot sank into a 
water-filled hole. 

Gervais waited until his 
companion had exhausted his 
vocabulary. “Because we want 
to make an investigation of 
their village," he explained. 
“They've been here for more 
than twenty years. In that 
time they could have reverted 
and be offering human sacri- 
fice to a totem or something. 
Or they could all have two 
heads — the kids, anyway — 
things like that. Wendle wants 
to know." 

“Then Wendle should have 
come down to find out.” Fro- 
bisher was annoyed. “How 
the hell did he think head- 
hunters could have operated a 
sub-etheric radio,? And the co- 
ordinates — they needed as- 
trogators to find them. Does 
that spell a primitive so- 
ciety?" 

Gervais didn't answer. A 
looped vine had somehow 
wrapped itself around his 
neck and was busy throttling 
him. His boots threshed the 
grass as the air left his lungs. 
He clawed at his belt, found 
his knife, desperately slashed 
at the vine. It was like hack- 
ing at steel cable. 

“Well?" Frobisher was 
striding ahead. “Does it?" 

The blast of Gervais's gun 
answered him. Gervais had 
managed to drag it from its 
holster and had severed the 
vine. He fell, rolled a couple 



51 




of times, then climbed to his 
feet. Around his neck the 
loosened vine hung like a 
mottled necktie. He flung it 
at Frobisher and painfully 
massaged his throat. 

“What’s the matter?” Fro- 
bisher, gun in hand, stared 
around through narrowed 
eyes. “What did you shoot 
at?” 

“You—” Gervais opened 
his mouth, closed it again in 
disgust. “Let’s get moving.” 

T hey moved for about a 
hundred yards and the 
ground vanished beneath their 
feet and they rolled to the 
bottom of a pit. It was a deep 
pit. The walls were sheer. 
They couldn’t get out. 

“Radio for help.” Frobish- 
er clawed sweat from his 
eyes. “Tell them to have an- 
other scout come down and 
rescue us.” 

“With what?” Gervais held 
out what was left of the port- 
able radio. He had landed on 
it when he fell. 

“Shout then.” Frobisher 
let out a yell. “Help! Help!” 
“Shut up!” Gervais clamp- 
ed his hand over his compan- 
ion’s mouth. “You want them 
to find us?” 

“I want them to get us out 
of here.” 

“Then what?” Gervais star- 
ed at the walls of the pit. 
“This thing was dug for a 
purpose, and it doesn’t take a 
genius to discover what that 
purpose is. Someone or some- 

52 



thing was meant to fall into 
it.” 

“A game pit?” 

“Or a moat. For defense, 
anyway. The villagers might 
not be too happy if they 
found us in here. They might 
do things, like throwing rocks 
down on us, or spears, or 
boiling water. Maybe that’s 
how they- get their food sup- 
ply.” 

Frobisher gulped. He grab- 
bed his knife and began 
hacking steps in the dirt wall 
of the pit. Given time he 
would have managed to cut 
enough handholds so as to 
climb out. He wasn’t given 
time. 

A rope fell from the top of 
the pit. It hit Gervais on the 
shoulders and he, with mem- 
ories of the throttling vine 
still fresh, fought it as 
though it were a living thing. 
Frobisher snatched it away 
from him and gave it a tug. It 
held firm. 

“Come on,” he said. He 
swung on the rope, planted 
his feet against the wall and 
began to climb. 

Gervais, not to be left be- 
hind, followed immediately 
after. As his feet left the 
ground, the rope began to 
move upward. They held on, 
hit the edge of the pit and, 
still clutching the rope, were 
dragged away from the edge. 

Shakily, they rose to their 
feet and stared around. No 
one was in sight. Only the 
rope, stretching from the pit 



TED BAIN 




into the undergrowth, showed 
signs of movement. It van- 
ished and then there was no 
movement at all. 

Not until the young wom- 
an stepped from the brush 
and came toward them. 

<^i^LORIA Hermitage,'’ said 

^ Gervais wonderingly, on 
the way back to the scout. 
‘Trofessor Gloria Hermitage. 
Can you beat it?” 

“No.” Frobisher trod on 
something which squelched. 
He lifted his foot and stared 
at a paper-thin organism 
which had wrapped itself 
around his boot. Wearily he 
scraped the mammoth leech 
against a tree. “Man, will I 
be glad to get off this plan- 
et!” 

“She gave herself the 
title.” Gervais couldn’t get 
over it. ‘'Stranded here all 
alone since she was a kid, the 
youngest one aboard. She edu- 
cated herself, built a sub- 
etheric radio as soon as she 
knew how — twenty years later 
— and called for a ship to 
come and get her.” He shook 
his head. “It beats anything I 
ever heard of in my life.” 

That, as Frobisher had to 
admit, was true enough. The 
young, attractive, athletic 
woman who had rescued them 
was alone on the planet. At 
the age of four or so, she had 
been the sole survivor of a 
wrecked educational vessel 
loaded with tapes, books, 
slides and other brain-food 

GOOD-BY, GLORIA 



for a newly opened planet's 
schools. With nothing to do 
other than survive — not the 
easiest thing in the first place 
— she had devoted herself to 
mental and physical improve- 
ment. The result had been 
staggering. 

“Strong as a horse,” mused 
Gervais. “Talks like a run- 
away encyclopedia. Learned 
enough to pass the examina- 
tions, so she gave herself the 
title of professor.” He jump- 
ed aside as something stirred 
in the grass at his feet. 
“Beats me how she ever man- 
aged to stay alive in the first 
place ” 

“She’s tough,” said Fro- 
bisher. He winced at a mem- 
ory. Appearances had fooled 
him and he had made a pass. 
Judo had been one of the 
things Professor Gloria Her- 
mitage had mastered. 

“And now she wants to 
spread her wings.” Gervais 
stared thoughtfully up at the 
sky. “Frobisher.” 

“What?” 

“You know what she wants, 
don’t you?” 

“I know.” Frobisher kicked 
at a branch. It didn’t run, stir 
or bite, so he stepped over it. 
“I’m surprised you didn’t 
volunteer.” 

“Not me.” Gervais was 
definite. “When I marry. I’m 
going to sign up with a soft 
little kitten who won’t look 
at me as if I ought to be in a 
zoo. I get enough of that from 
Wendle.” 



53 




Frobisher made an explo- 
sive sound. 

Gervais tugged his gun 
from his belt. ‘‘What's the 
matter?” 

“Wendle.” Frobisher slap- 
ped his thigh. “Now I know 
what she reminded me of. 
Wendle, of course — who else 
but him?” 

“So?” 

“So use your imagination. 
She looks like Wendle — in a 
female way, of course. She 
talks like him. She made us 
feel just as moronic as Wen- 
dle does, only more so. She 
had the same ‘holier than 
thou' attitude and expression. 
I tell you they are out of the 
same mold.” 

“How nice.” Gervais was 
sarcastic. “Do we send them 
a bouquet?” 

“We do better than that.” 
Frobisher was enjoying him- 
self. “We put them around 
each other's neck — for life.” 

Gervais started to grin. 

“See it now? Wendle thinks 
he's better than the human 
race. Gloria thinks she is. Just 
put those two together and 
let her sink her claws into 
him. She wants to get married 
to a man she can respect. All 
right, let her marry Wendle. 
Just think of the life that 
poor so-and-so will suffer 
once he ties up with someone 
better than he is.” 

“And she would be better,” 
agreed Gervais. “Living alone 
like she did. Learning all that 
stuff from the educational 



tapes, books and visual guides. 
Hell, Wendle would be like a 
new-born baby next to her.” 
His grin expanded. “What a 
revenge!” 

“Classic,” said Frobisher. 
“Poetic justice right down 
the line.” 

“The fruits of victory,” 
said Frobisher. “Let’s cele- 
brate.” 

“But supposing they don’t 
like each other?” A shadow 
touched Gervais's happiness. 

F robisher dismissed the 

idea. “They will. Wendle 
is a lonely cuss who doesn’t 
want women just because 
they are women. He wants a 
girl with brains as well as a 
body. Gloria has brains and 
she has a body too.” He sigh- 
ed, thinking of how he had 
once felt about that body. 
“He can't help but fall for 
her.” 

“She'll have to have long, 
intimate talks with him so as 
to fill the record,” said Ger- 
vais. “She'll have to tell him 
all about her past and the rest 
of it. They can swap mathe- 
matical problems together 
and maybe play tri-chess.” 
His grin widened. “Wendle 
isn't a bad-looking character 
and we know what Gloria 
wants. A man to marry so 
that she can ...” He suddenly 
lost his smile. “No.” 

“No what?” Frobisher 
squinted ahead to where he 
could see the ship. 

“No dice. No putting them

together. Nothing like that at 
all." 

''You crazy?" 

‘Tm sane. You think about 
it for a while." 

Frobisher thought about it. 
He couldn’t see what objec- 
tion there could be to the 
great idea. It would serve 
Wendle right. A guy like that 
shouldn’t have been born. And 
then he saw what Gervais 
was getting at. 

T ogether they reached 
and climbed aboard the 
scout. Together they stared at 
the planet as it dwindled be- 
low. Silently Frobisher heard 
Gervais make his report. 

"There was nothing else to 
do," said Gervais when he had 
switched off the radio. 

"I suppose not," Frobisher 
said. 

"Wendle’s bad," said Ger- 
vais. "Bad in the sense that 
he’s a stinker to be under. But 
he’s only one. We can put up 
with one of his kind." 
Frobisher grunted. 

"Put him and Gloria to- 
gether and what happens? 
She wants to marry and have 



kids. Lots of kids." Gervais 
shuddered. "Between them 
they’d start a dynasty. Their 
kids would have other kids, 
and so on. And they’d all be 
like Wendle and Gloria." 

"Don’t!" Frobisher had an 
imagination. 

We’ve got to be brave 
about this," said Gervais. 
"We’ve got to forget personal 
vengeance and take a long- 
term view. The way things 
are, we can be transferred or 
promoted, or Wendle could 
die or retire or something. 
But suppose the service be- 
came filled with his and 
Gloria’s offspring?" 

It didn’t bear thinking 
about. 

"So we tell Wendle that the 
community was mutated and 
rife with disease. He won’t 
doubt our word. Gloria will 
be left in peace, and genera- 
tions of spacemen as yet un- 
born will have cause to bless 
our name." Gervais drew a 
deep breath. "You know, Fro- 
bisher, it makes a man feel 
humble and a little proud." 

It did, Frobisher realized.

BREAKTHROUGH 

Bone glue may cut the setting time of fractures from six months to three 
days, and eliminate casts, crutches and traction entirely, if the polyure- 
thane plastic undergoing tests in U. S. and Canadian medical schools 
and hospitals proves as good as it has in 250 cases in the past three 
years. The ends of the break grow through the glue, which is tougher 
than bone, and join together in a year, by which time the glue is com- 
pletely absorbed. More important to the patient, he can walk on a broken 
leg or use a broken arm in only three days.

of a Prodigal 

By J. T. MclNTOSH 

It was bad enough when Clare painted Henry 
Robert Colquhoun Adams yellow — but then she 



did the same to 




everyone else in Luna Cityl 



S ECOND Officer Jones took 
a last admiring look at his 
favorite passenger on the 
long trip from Scylla. “You’re 
going to stay here, Miss Ver- 
non?” he said, astonished. 
“Beats me why you should 
bury yourself in a hole like 
Luna City.” 

“You mustn’t call my home 
town a hole,” said Clare re- 
provingly, “even if it is.” 
“Your home town?” Jones 
incredulously said. “You mean 
you were born in Luna City? 
How did that come about?” 
“I imagine it came about in 
the usual way,” Clare Vernon 
said. 

“I mean — you’re no via- 
phobe.” 

“Being born on the Moon 
doesn’t necessarily make you 
a viaphobe, though it helps. 
Anyway, don’t you know 
•there’s no such thing as via- 



57 




phobia? Anybody in Luna 
City will tell you.” 

“Anybody in a nuthouse 
will tell you he’s sane,” Jones 
r0tort0(i. 

‘That's a point. But it isn't 
V0ry nic0 of you to toll mo I 
was brought up in a nut- 
houso." 

“I didn't moan that, Miss 
Vornon. Woll, I guoss thoy'll 
bo killing tho fattod calf for 
you right now." 

“I doubt it," Claro sighed. 
“More likely to be heating 
the tar and feathers. 'By, Mr. 
Jones." 

S HE walked down the en- 
closed gangway to the 
spaceport terminal, white and 
beautiful and as much out of 
place in the center of bleak 
Mare Imbrium as a hot dog 
stand in the middle of the 
Sahara. 

She ignored the other pas- 
sengers waiting for the ten- 
der to take them on to Earth. 
They were the star-travelers, 
for whom the Moon was no 
more than a customs check- 
point, a mildly irritating de- 
lay within sight of their 
destination. They didn't have 
time to drop down in the ele- 
vators for even a glance at 
Luna City, and if they had 
had time, few would have 
bothered. 

Clare was the only person 
to make the descent. The offi- 
cials and porters were still 
busy with the passengers 
waiting for the Earth tender, 

58 



which would land as soon as 
the big starship was gone. 

Luna City couldn't really 
be preparing a tar-and-feath- 
er reception for Clare, be- 
cause no one knew she was 
coming back. Clare herself 
wasn't quite sure why she had 
come back. Not because she 
was homesick. Not to see her 
family again — there was only 
her sister Emma to see, and 
Clare and Emma had always 
found it quite easy to get 
along without each other. Not 
to see Greg Miller, whom she 
would probably have married 
if she had stayed iiL Luna 
City. 

Well, why did you go home 
anyway? Because you'd been 
hurt, because the great big 
world or the great big galaxy 
hadn’t turned out to be as 
glamorous and exciting as 
you thought, because you 
were broke, because you need- 
ed a quiet place to lick your 
wounds and prepare for the 
fray again. Most of ali, be- 
cause nobody at the moment 
seemed eager for your ser- 
vices or your person. 

All that was near enough 
the truth. 

Thoughtfully, without any 
sign of regret, Clare pulled 
the wedding ring off her lin- 
ger and dropped it in her 
pocket. Divorce was easy 
across umpteen light-years. 
The wedding ring, though it 
had been useful on the ship, 
had no place in Luna City. It 
no longer meant anything.

E mma VERNON had a 
premonition of disaster 
as she fixed her hair. The fact 
that her sister was at that 
very moment on her way 
down from the spaceport was 
not a great coincidence — 
Emma was always having 
premonitions of disaster. 

The phone rang and she 
knew at once what her pre- 
monition had been about — 
Tony couldn’t go to the 
Adams Festival ball that 
night. When she heard Tony’s 
voice she was sure of it. 

'‘Oh, Tony!” she wailed, 
before he’d had a chance to 
say anything. 

"What’s the matter?” he 
asked, startled. 

"I know what you’re going 
to say. You’re not taking me 
to the dance — ” 

"Em,” said Tony, exasper- 
ated, "it’s about time you 
stopped behaving like a neu- 
rotic teen-ager. After all, 
you’re — ” 

"I know. I’m thirty-two, 
and I’ve never denied it. But 
I’m not exactly decrepit, am 
I? I can still go to a dance if 
I like, can’t I? And I did so 
want to. But maybe you think 
I am decrepit. Maybe you — ” 
"Em, for Pete’s sake . 
All I wanted to say was, 
please don’t enter the Festi- 
val Queen contest. Mother 
thinks—” 

"But I want to enter!” 
Swept along by the tide of her 
disappointment and indigna- 
tion, Emma instantly replaced 

RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



one grievance with another. 
"What’s your mother got to 
do with it?” 

"She thinks — I think too, 
Em — after all, beauty con- 
tests are for girls of seven- 
teen and eighteen, and — ” 

"So that’s it. Well, if that’s 
how you feel, Tony Benson, 
you’d better take some other 
girl. Vm certainly not going 
with you!’' 

She slammed the phone 
down. 

T he elevator door slid 
open and Clare faced 
Adams Square, the most 
gorgeous sight in the most 
gorgeous city in the Galaxy. 

It was strange that Second 
Officer Jones had referred to 
Luna City as a hole. Stranger 
still that the seasoned travel- 
ers up on the surface hadn’t 
seemed to care that they 
hadn’t time for a visit. For 
Luna City was easily the 
most magnificent city of all 
history and all space. 

Everybody in Luna City 
knew that. 

Perhaps more conclusive 
was the fact that a large pro- 
portion of the population of 
Earth thought so too. 

Gravity being only a frac- 
tion of what it was on larger 
worlds, the most fantastic 
architectural effects were pos- 
sible. Every major building 
reached from floor to ceiling 
and did its share in support- 
ing the vast roof. This was 
silver and lit by direct light- 

59 




ing which became transform- 
ed into soft indirect light 
that made Luna City a town 
without shadows. 

Rather than being a town- 
ship built in a cave, though, 
Luna City was a series of 
carefully calculated cavities, 
so arranged that the eye add- 
ed one to another and got 
an impression of enormous 
depth and distance. Its de- 
signers had had the rare 
insight not to plan an artifi- 
cial underground city which 
would always be a poor copy 
of an outdoor, open-air town- 
ship, but instead . to make 
capital of the very deficien- 
cies of their medium and plan 
the kind of city which could 
only be constructed in such 
conditions. 

What made every visitor 
gasp when he looked across 
Adams Square for the first 
time was the unconscious cer- 
tainty tliat he was looking at 
a miracle. He was used, of 
course, to gravity approxi- 
mating one G. Although his 
eye was forced to record what 
it saw, what it recorded 
couldn’t be so, because such 
things could not exist. And 
even if his brain knew the 
real answer — that here a 
rolled newspaper would sup- 
port a man's weight — his eye 
continued to marvel. 

The- engineering wonders 
were only the beginning of 
the miracle of Luna City. The 
artistic miracle was far great- 
er. The architects had scrap- 

60 



ped all they knew about 
stresses and started again. 
Unsupported planes were 
commonplace. If they wanted 
a thin, flat platform jutting 
into space, a balcony or veran- 
da or stage or hood, there was 
no need whatever to canti- 
lever it. And the curved, 
sweeping promenades which 
soared high in the air from 
building to building needed 
no support along their incred- 
ible length. Not only was 
their own strength adequate 
to bear their own weight and 
any added burden they might 
have to carry — there were no 
winds to tear at them. 

The architects and builders 
had seized their unique op- 
portunity with imagination 
and enthusiasm, and surely no 
one could deny Luna City's 
claim to be the most beautiful 
city in the Galaxy. 

Yet the engineering mar- 
vels and artistic triumph of 
the city were only a part of 
the scene which met the eye 
of a visitor, and some might 
say not the most important 
part. There remained the 
people. 

Just to complete the mir- 
acle of Luna City, its men 
were the handsomest, its 
women the most seductive, to 
be found anywhere in the 
Galaxy. 

There was one thing more 
— one thing which made Luna 
City almost utopia. 

The Moon had vast mineral 
wealth, and the way Father 

j. T. McIntosh 




Adams had arranged things 
long ago, everybody shared 
in the loot without having to 
do very much for it. Only you 
had to be a native-born Lu- 
nan. Luna couldn’t support 
all the bums in the Galaxy. 

Only her own. 

The most beautiful, richest 
city in the Galaxy, with the 
handsomest people. 

It was strange indeed that 
Second Officer Jones had call- 
ed Luna City a hole. 

N aturally Clare’s eye 

ran up the column on the 
top of which Henry Robert 
Colquhoun Adams stood in 
marble aloofness, looking 
down complacently at the city 
he had helped to build. 

Poor Henry Robert, Clare 
thought. The first viaphobe. 
Like every victim of viapho- 
bia ever since, he had declar- 
ed stoutly and indignantly 
that there was no such thing. 
That he founded Luna City 
because he wanted to, cer- 
tainly not because he was 
scared to entrust himself to 
space again. 

The strange thing about 
viaphobia was that unlike 
other neuroses — if it was a 
neurosis — it appeared to be 
hereditary. It was an unde- 
niable fact that to this day no 
Adams had ever left Luna 
City, apart from brief trips 
up to the Moon’s surface to 
see what space was like. 

Clare had a particular reas- 
on for looking up that long, 

RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



slim column. She marveled as 
she did so. Once she had 
climbed that column. She had 
been furious at the time. 
That helped. 

Bill Adams, leaning back 
comfortably on one of the 
seats in the park opposite the 
elevators, sat up in surprise 
when he saw that the Scylla 
ship had brought a visitor to 
Luna City — and a visitor who 
intended, judging by the size 
and number of her bags, to 
stay for some time. If colo- 
nials chose to visit Luna City 
at all, and they usually did 
just to say they’d seen it, they 
almost always went to Earth 
first and visited the Moon 
from there, together with 
thousands of other tourists. 

However, he wasn’t sorry 
to see this one. Quite the re- 
verse. In her neat gray suit, 
elegant but conservative, she 
should have looked drab and 
uninteresting in Luna City, 
where the girls were dressed 
like chorines. She didn’t. 

Bill jumped up and bowed 
politely, a gesture of which 
Henry Robert Colquhoun 
Adams, looking down on it, 
must have approved. “Can I 
be of assistance, miss?” he 
asked. 

Nothing had changed in ten 
\ears, Clare thought. How 
could it? How could Luna 
City ever change? 

She recognized Bill Adams, 
who had been a gawky thir- 
teen-year-old last time she 
had seen him, and was amus- 

61 




ed to see that he didn't recog- 
nize her. 

“You certainly can," she 
said, and mischievously al- 
lowed a hint of colonial accent 
to creep into her voice. 
“Where do you suggest I live 
in this wonderful place?" 

Bill swelled happily. “Quite 
a place, isn't it?" he said. 
“How about the Hotel Mag- 
nificent?” 

“I am poor and not particu- 
larly honest," Clare sighed. 
“How about somewhere a lit- 
tle le^s Magnificent?" 

“There's the Grand — ” 

“Even somewhere a little 
less Grand. Isn't there a hotel 
called the Henry Robert?" 

Bill took in her elegant 
clothes which, conservative as 
they were, must have cost ten 
times as much as the span- 
gled shorts and bolero of the 
girl who was surveying Clare 
critically as she passed. “I 
don't think you'd like the 
Henry Robert, miss." 

“I hate to contradict you, 
but I would. Besides, that's it 
just across the square, isn't 
it?" 

Even with this hint, it 
didn’t cross Bill's mind that 
this cosmopolitan stranger 
could have been in Luna City 
before, much less that she 
could be a native of the city. 
He picked up the two heaviest 
bags as if they were as light 
as feathers, which they al- 
most were, and led the way. 
He didn’t talk; he preferred 
to let the glamorous visitor 

62 



drink in the marvels of her 
surroundings. 

“I can manage now, thank 
you," said Clare, as they 
reached the entrance. She 
hesitated. Ten years ago, tip- 
ping had been unknown in 
wealthy Luna City. People 
helped you out of friendliness 
and laughed if a visitor of- 
fered money — not outraged, 
because tourists didn't know 
any better, but proud to show 
that Luna City's standard of 
living was so high nobody 
had to do minor services^ for 
money. 

“If you're thinking of tip- 
ping me," said Bill, “please 
don't. In Luna City — " 

“I know," said Clare. “I 
didn't think that would have 
changed." 

At last he got it. “Chang- 
ed? You've been here before?" 

“Not since the time I 
painted your great-grandfath- 
er,” Clare said, and left him 
staring. 

A S CLARE was shown up 
to her room, she reflected 
that in half an hour every- 
body would know Clare Ver- 
non was back. By now Bill 
Adams must have put two and 
two together with the usual 
result. 

Alone in her room she 
started to change, realizing 
that in Luna City her modest 
gray suit was actually flam- 
boyant — and Clare was only 
occasionally flamboyant. Then 
she saw that Henry Robert 



1. T. McIntosh 




Colquhoun Adams, level with 
her on top of his column, was 
staring right into her bed- 
room. The sculptor had given 
him the kind of eyes which 
followed one everywhere. 

‘'All right,” she said aloud. 
“Have a good look.” She 
turned and posed for him. 
Then she said: “Oh, sorry,” 
and took off her wristwatch. 
“That better?” 

Clare was prepared to ad- 
mit that it had been most ill- 
bred of her to climb up and 
paint Father Adams yellow 
ten years ago. Many of us do 
things at eighteen which we 
wouldn't do at twenty-eight. 

All the same, she still 
wasn't exactly sorry. After 
she'd given her evidence at 
the viaphobia survey in New 
York, the things which hap- 
pened to her back in Luna 
City shouldn't have happened 
to a pup. And why shouldn't 
she give evidence? Somebody 
from Luna City had to. 

Anyway, when it became 
clear that she couldn't go on 
living in Luna City — not that 
that broke her heart — she had 
had to make some parting 
gesture to show she didn't 
give a darn for Luna City or 
anybody in it. And climbing 
up Father Adams' column 
and painting him yellow had 
seemed like a good idea. 

She still thought so, after 
ten years. 

Em's indignant letters had 
told her at the time what 
Luna City had thought of the 

RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



outrage. Clare's traitorous 
testimony at the New York 
investigation into viaphobia 
might have been forgotten in 
time. After all, being only 
eighteen, she didn't know any 
better. But the second crime 
was unforgivable. If Clare 
ever dared to return, her re- 
ception would make the death 
of a thousand cuts look like 
old-fashioned hospitality. 

S OON now she'd know what 
Luna City proposed to 
do about it. She had deliber- 
ately mentioned the painting 
episode to Bill Adams just to 
make sure there was no mis- 
understanding. 

The phone rang. She snap- 
ped the switch to the left — 
sound without vision. “Clare 
Vernon?” rasped a voice she 
knew, that of old Judge Hen- 
ry Adams. 

“The same,” said Clare. 
“How are you. Judge?” 

“Are you afraid to let me 
see you, miss?” the Judge de- 
manded. 

“Yes,” said Clare. “I don't 
happen to have any clothes 
on. I'm afraid you might get 
excited.” 

Horrible sounds bubbled 
from the small loudspeaker. 
The first coherent words 
were: “You are shameless, 
miss!” 

“Surely not,” said Clare 
mildly, “or I'd have switched 
on the vision.” 

“If you think,” the Judge 
roared, “that everything will 

63 




be set right by an apology, 
you’re wrong.” 

“Oh, good,” said Clare. “In 
that case I won’t have to 
apologize.” 

Incoherent sounds started 
again, to cease abruptly as 
the Judge cut himself off. 

C LARE put on a soft blue 
dress with a plunge which 
stopped only a little below 
waist level — quiet and re- 
strained by local standards, 
without being dull. 

Luna City’s environment 
made it really unnecessary to 
wear clothes at all, but civi- 
lization shrinks from such 
extreme frankness. Curious- 
ly, the less the climate 
demands clothes, the more 
important they invariably be- 
come, and in Luna City they 
were more important than 
anywhere else. Even the men 
took a lot of trouble over 
their clothes, though nat- 
urally they pretended they 
didn’t. 

The women wore every con- 
ceivable variety of garment, 
including a few items which 
wouldn’t be practical any- 
where but in Luna City. It 
was unnecessary to wear 
brassieres or girdles for sup- 
port. (Earth’s pin-up girls 
usually came to the Moon for 
studio pictures — they looked 
much better there.) On the 
other hand, if even an ap- 
proximation to decency was 
to be preserved, due account 
had to be taken in the design 

64 



of a costume of the fact that 
every time a girl moved, her 
clothes floated about her like 
bubbles. 

Clare looked at herself in 
the mirror and decided that 
whatever happened, she would 
meet it looking her best. 

The phone rang again. This 
time Clare set the switch to 
the right. She had no objec- 
tion to people seeing her now. 
Quite the reverse. 

It wasn’t difficult to guess 
that the egg-headed man with 
the green eyeshade was a re- 
porter. Clearly he had seen 
everything. 

“Luna Argils,” he said in- 
differently. “Clare Vernon?” 

“At your service,” said 
Clare. 

He didn’t give his name. 
“Miss Vernon, I’d like to 
have your story of what hap- 
pened ten years ago.” Ob- 
viously he wasn’t going to 
believe it anyway. 

“It must be in your files. 
Every scream of it.” 

“Sure, but I’d like your ver- 
sion, Miss Vernon.” 

“That’s strange. Nobody 
wanted my version ten years 
ago. Well, in as few words as 
possible, a couple of investi- 
gators from New York called 
on me and asked me a few 
questions about viaphobia. 
After a while they asked if 
I’d go to New York with them 
and talk to a commission 
there that was investigating 
viaphobia. I said I would, and 
I did. When I came back — ” 

j. T. McIntosh 




“Just a minute, Miss Ver- 
non. What exactly happened 
in New York? What did you 
say V* 

“That’s in your files too. I 
said what I believed to be the 
truth. I was no viaphobe, ob- 
viously. When I got back 
here, I was treated as a trait- 
or. Nothing official. Just pub- 
lic opinion, applied where it 
hurt. So I painted Father 
Adams and hit the trail.” 

“That’s all you want to say. 
Miss Vernon?” 

“I don’t see any pressing 
need to say anything else.” 

“Thank you. Miss Vernon.” 
And he cut the connection. 

It was very unsatisfactory 
from Clare’s point of view. 
She wanted to know what to 
expect, but the anonymous 
reporter had been as imper- 
sonal as a robot. He hadn’t 
been for her or against her. He 
hadn’t even seemed particu- 
larly interested. Worst of all, 
he had looked at her as he 
might have looked at a dead 
cow. 

Once more the phone rang. 
The face which appeared was 
much younger than the last, 
and its eyes widened gratify- 
ingly as they came to rest on 
Clare. This reporter hadn’t 
yet seen everything. 

“Clare Vernon? I’m Mike 
Reynolds of the Moon Rocket. 
Say, we could use a piece on 
you.” 

“Yes?” said Clare guarded- 
ly. The Moon Rocket, unless 
it had changed out of all rec- 



ognition, was a spicy rag de- 
voted entirely to sex, sadism 
and sensationalism. 

“Sure. I understand you 
had a tough time before you 
left Luna City. Your coming 
back like this makes it news 
again. Were you ever beaten 
up? Raped? Anything like 
that? Just give us a few facts 
and one of the boys will write 
it up like the Battle of Water- 
loo.” 

Was she ever beaten up? 
Yes, once, only once. The rest 
of the time what had happen- 
ed to her, unpleasant as it 
was, had stopped short of 
physical violence. 

This once she’d been com- 
ing home late with Greg 
Miller. Until then she’d 
thought that being with Greg 
would be some protection. 
Three youths in silk slacks 
had shoved her and Greg into 
an alley. They hadn’t said a 
word. After a couple of jolts 
in the ribs which made him 
gasp, Greg hadn’t given them 
any trouble. He stood in 
white-faced terror and let 
them get on with it. 

One of them twisted her 
arms up behind her and held 
her in helpless agony while 
the other two sank their fists 
anywhere they would sink. 
They beat her for three or 
four minutes, while she won- 
dered why she didn’t die. 
didn’t even lose conscious- 
ness. They punched every 
square inch of flesh on the 
front of her body, then start-

ed over and went around 
again. 

She wasn’t screaming be- 
cause every time she got some 
air in her lungs they jolted it 
out of her. When they did 
stop she didn’t know about it. 
The next she remembered was 
lying with her cheek on the 
ground, with Greg bending 
over her. 

He’d been some use after 
all. He helped her to get 
home. 

“Sorry,” Clare said to the 
Rocket reporter. “I don’t 
want to be written up like 
the Battle of Waterloo.” She 
switched off. 

«¥JELLO, Em,” said Clare. 

-H Emma took one look 
at her and burst into tears. 

Clare stepped back, sur- 
prised. “Well, we were never 
exactly buddies, but I didn’t 
know it would be that much 
of a shock when I came back.” 

Mostly Emma was crying 
about Tony, whose fault it all 
was. For the rest, she wasn’t 
crying because Clare had 
come back, but because she 
was so darned lovely. Emma 
had always been the pretty 
one, not Clare. And now . 

“Oh, well,” said Clare 
philosophically, “I’ll go away 
and come back again. That’ll 
give you a chance to get over 
your tears of joy at seeing 
your only sister after ten 
years.” 

She went out into the 
street again. 

66 



Nobody she passed recog- 
nized her. Could it be that 
Luna City didn’t care that 
Clare Vernon was back? She 
doubted it. Judge Adams 
cared. 

They just failed to recog- 
nize her as the plump, untidy, 
restless, too-smart teen-ager 
who used to make such a fool 
of herself over Greg Miller. 

Greg was alone in his store 
when she walked in. He rec- 
ognized her. She was amused 
to see that he was terrified of 
her. 

Now what could he pos- 
sibly be terrified about? Was 
he afraid that anyone who 
even spoke to her would be 
banished from Luna City? 

Well, it was possible. After 
that night when she was 
beaten up, he’d written and 
phoned and sent flowers, but 
hadn’t come near her. There 
had been more than a chance 
that Clare Vernon’s boy 
friend would be beaten up 
too. 

“I heard you were back. 
Miss Vernon,” Greg said. It 
came out as a croak, and he 
had to clear his throat noisily 
and say it again. It sounded 
still sillier the second time. 

Greg hadn’t worn well. He 
couldn’t be more than thirty- 
two or so, but already he was 
thin on top, harassed, visibly 
aging. 

“What’s this ‘Miss Vernon’ 
routine?” Clare demanded. 

“It’s been a long time,” said 
Greg timidly. 



j. T. McIntosh 




“Yes. Ten years. Tm sur- 
prised to see you're still 
alive." 

That stiffened him. “Fm 
not as old as all that!'' 

“No, I "svas only thinking 
that once you were going to 
kill yourself over me. You 
said life wasn't worth living 
without me. Didn't you, 
Greg?" 

Greg writhed. Clare knew 
now exactly why he was 
scared. He was afraid she 
had come back to mate, kill 
and eat him. 

“I'll tell you the truth," 
said Clare with a burst of 
frankness. “You were right 
about us, Greg. I found I 
couldn't live without you." 

G reg took an involuntary 
step backward and knock- 
ed over a pile of cans. Clare 
helped him to pick them up. 
In doing so she got very close 
to him, and once when his leg 
touched her hip he flinched as 
if she were red-hot. Sitting 
on her heels, she looked up at 
him, smiling. She hadn't for- 
gotten she was wearing a 
dress with a spectacular 
plunge. 

“Never mind," said Greg 
hoarsely. “I'll pick them up 
later." 

She took pity on him. 
Standing up, she said: “All 
the same, Greg, I can't marry 
you. I've promised six other 
guys. Be seeing you." 

She left him dizzy with re- 
lief. 



Greg was a viaphobe, of 
course. 

Clare had grown out of the 
intolerance of her teens. She 
no longer scorned viaphobes 
just because she didn't hap- 
pen to be one herself. She 
knew it wasn't their fault. 

Before space flight, some 
people had liked to travel 
about the surface of Earth 
and some hadn't. It was never 
much of a problem, because if 
you didn’t like traveling a 
hundred miles, you weren't 
likely to contract to go ten 
thousand. 

But space was different. 
There's something awful about 
space, even the tiny hop from 
Earth to Moon. It shakes you 
to the core, forces you to look 
at yourself and your place in 
the Cosmos, makes you under- 
stand your utter insignifi- 
cance in the galactic scheme 
of things. And there are 
physical effects too. If a 
friendly, solid thing like the 
sea could make people wish 
they were dead, what could 
unfriendly, empty space do to 
them? 

It could do plenty. Space 
sickness is a hundred times 
worse than sea sickness. It 
doesn't give up after an hour 
or two or a day or two. So, 
apart from the pain, the 
horror, the agony of being in 
space if you have the misfor- 
tune to be a viaphobe, there 
is the fact that you must 
starve to death if your trip 
is longer than from Earth to 



RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



67 




Moon. No viaphobe has ever 
reached Mars or Venus alive, 
much less the stars. 

Sedation won’t quell the 
internal upheaval. Nothing 
quells it except death. If 
you’re a viaphobe you stay 
put on your home planet. You 
have to. 

Nowadays nobody dies in 
agony on the Earth-Mars run. 
A preliminary check is obliga- 
tory. From all worlds there 
are test space flights which 
last long enough to show up 
viaphobia, and not long 
enough to produce more than 
a few hours of hell if you hap- 
pen to be a victim. You don’t 
get on a regular space flight 
without a certiflcate to show 
you’re no viaphobe. 

But in the early days there 
was nothing like that. People 
went from Earth to the Moon 
and found out the hard way. 
They didn’t die — the trip 
isn’t long enough. On the 
Moon they recovered, but 
with a fixed determination 
never to suffer anything like 
that again. 

This happened to far more 
people than it should. There 
was a simple reason for this. 

Pride. 

When people were sick on 
the way to the Moon, there 
couldn’t be any secret about 
it. You couldn’t fight and con- 
quer space sickness the way 
some people could fight and 
conquer sea sickness. 

Afterward, however, it was 
natural to laugh it off. “Sure, 

68 



I was space sick. But hell. Pm 
okay now. Sure I could go 
back. If I wanted to, I could 
go back any time. But I like 
it here. Luna City’s great. 
Why should I go back?’’ 
Nobody on the Moon had 
ever denied that there was 
such a thing as space sickness 
— neither those who had suf- 
fered it nor those who hadn’t. 
But many people denied the 
existence of viaphobia. 

“Sure, I was space sick ...” 
Even ten years ago, when 
mankind had spread out to 
the stars, Luna City still 
didn’t admit that there was 
any such thing as viaphobia. 
Space sickness, yes. “If I 
wanted to, I could go back 
any time.” 

That was why Clare Ver- 
non had committed a crime 
in going before a commission 
in New York and telling them 
what she knew and guessed 
about viaphobia. 

L ike Greg, Judge Adams 
recognized Clare at once. 
She met him just after 
she’d left Greg’s store. The 
Judge said: “I am amazed. 
Miss Vernon, to see you have 
the effrontery to walk Luna 
City’s streets.” 

“Why, Judge!” Clare pro- 
tested. “I’m not walking the 
streets!” 

The Judge went red as fire. 
“I didn’t mean — I merely 
meant that after those dis- 
graceful incidents of ten years 
» 



j. T. McIntosh 




"Think nothing of it, 
Judge. Tve forgiven you long 
ago.” 

Two or three people who 
had overheard some of this 
had stopped. In a few mo- 
ments there was quite a crowd 
pretending not to listen, but 
not missing a word. 

Everybody knew Judge 
Adams, of course. And every- 
body had heard about Clare 
Vernon. 

"If you were a man Td 
know what to do with you,” 
Judge Adams roared. 

"You mean that you don't 
know what to do with ... no, 
Judge, I must have misunder- 
stood you.” 

"Let me pass,” said the 
Judge furiously. "I have no 
desire to take part in a public 
contest in repartee.” 

"No, indeed,” Clare agreed. 
"I don’t know where Repartee 
is, but why should you go 
there just to take part in a 
contest? You might get vi — I 
mean, you might get space 
sick.” 

The Judge controlled hirn- 
self with an effort. "If you 
ever speak that word in Luna 
City,” he said, "you, of all 
people, you’ll be in grave dan- 
ger of being torn limb from 
limb.” 

"What word?” Clare asked 
innocently. 

"You know what I mean,” 
said the Judge, and he stalk- 
ed past her. 

Yes, she knew. 

People have always been 



like that. When someone says : 
If there's one thing I never 
do, it's ... you can be quite 
sure that’s one thing he does 
do. When he says: If there's 
one thing I'm not, it's . you 
know that’s one thing he is. 

Years ago people on Earth 
had heard of viaphobia. They 
couldn’t understand what 
Luna City was so touchy 
about. There was such a 
thing as space sickness, v/as- 
n’t there? Well, then, that 
was viaphobia. What did the 
people on the Moon mean, 
there was space sickness but 
viaphobia didn’t exist? 

Only viaphobes said there 
was no such thing as via- 
phobia. 

^^I^XCUSE me . said a 
-1^ voice, 

"Why, what have you 
done?” Clare asked. 

The rather nice-looking 
young man grinned. "Noth- 
ing, but I make no promises 
for the future. Aren’t you 
Clare Vernon?” 

"I have that distinction.” 
"I’m Tony Benson. You 
don’t know me because I was 
at school on Earth when you 
were here before. Fve seen 
pictures of you. They didn’t 
do you justice.” 

"Justice, yes. Mercy, no.” 
"Don’t be modest. Will you 
come with me to the ball to- 
night?” 

It was brash, typical of 
the colonies rather than of 
Luna City. She had no diffi- 



RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



69 




culty in believing that Tony 
Benson hadn't always lived 
in Luna City. 

''Yes," she said. 

"That's great, Clare. Now 
suppose you go back to your 
hotel and slip on another 
dress and I'll call for you 
about eight?" 

"You know where I’m 
staying?" 

"Everybody does." 

She wanted to ask him 
about that, what people were 
saying about her, how Luna 
City was reacting to her re- 
turn. The fact that he was 
prepared to be friendly — at 
the very least — didn't give 
her a line, because he was no 
viaphobe. 

"All right," she said. She 
couldn't ask him. 

As she walked back to the 
Henry Robert, she saw that 
everybody knew her now. A 
few minutes ago they hadn't. 
A few minutes was all Luna 
City needed. 

Release a rumor in any 
other town and it spreads 
fast to the edge of town and 
dies there. In Luna City, 
when a rumor reaches the 
walls it bounces back. Five 
minutes hadn’t been enough 
for the people in the streets 
to learn that Clare Vernon 
was back. Ten minutes was. 

She couldn’t tell much from 
the way people looked at her. 
People saw her, pointed her 
out to each other and whis- 
pered. The same thing would 
have happened if she'd been 



an actress, a princess, a mur- 
deress. 

And gradually Clare real- 
ized she was acting like a 
narcissistic adolescent. She 
had come back out of bravado, 
just because nobody in Luna 
City believed she’d ever dare 
come back. 

Suddenly she wanted John. 
All these light-years away, 
what they had quarreled 
about seemed unimportant. 
Either of them could have 
healed the breach, right up to 
that last moment when, rath- 
er to her surprise, he had 
come to the spaceport to see 
her off. Neither had made the 
move. And now it was cer- 
tainly too late. 

Tony Benson reminded her 
a little of John. 

She, pushed the memory of 
John to the back of her mind 
as someone actually nodded 
politely to her. It was Bill 
Adams. 

"Mr. Adams," she said, 
though she still thought of 
him as a boy, "I hope you 
didn’t think I was rude 
earlier." 

"No," he said, "I didn’t 
think you were rude." But 
there was some constraint in 
his manner, and she made up 
her mind to probe it. 

"I wasn’t laughing at you 
either," she said. 

"No." 

"Mr. Adams, you were 
very friendly earlier. You're 
not now. Is it because I paint- 
ed your grandfather?" 



70 



j. T. McIntosh 




“No,” he said. “It's not 
that at all. Miss Vernon, if 
you had only one leg, would 
you enjoy the taunts of peo- 
ple who had two?” 

It hit Clare harder than the 
blows of those three young 
toughs ten years ago. 

W HEN someone insists 
that black is white, you 
feel you can't let him get 
away with that. You try to 
make him see that black is 
black. It doesn't occur to you 
that it may be of great im- 
portance to him to cling to 
the idea that black is white. 

Viaphobes said there was 
no such thing as viaphobia. 
So you had to show them they 
were wrong. But the moment 
they admitted they were 
wrong — “All right, so I’m a 
viaphobe. So what?” — there 
was suddenly nothing to say. 
Nothing to do. Nothing but 
to be sorry for them. 
Prisoners. 

Naturally they thought 
Luna City was wonderful. 
They might as well. They 
couldn't leave it. 

“Bill, I'm Sony,” Clare 
said with remorse. “But 
you've given me a shock. You 
mean there is such a thing as 
viaphobia? And you know 
it?” 

“Of course we know,” he 
said bitterly. “We've always 
known.” 

Clare stared at him. That 
simply couldn't be true. 

Bill seemed to sense what 



she was thinking. “Not the 
older people,” he said. “Not 
Judge Adams. He'll never ad- 
mit there's any such thing. 
But those of us who are 
younger . We're not crazy, 
you know. We realize we 
can't travel in space. It may 
be a physical or mental de- 
fect, but who cares which? 
Either way we can't leave 
Luna City. And that's what 
they call viaphobia.” 

“That's just what I said 
ten years ago.” 

“No, it's not. You said, in 
effect, ‘The poor suckers are 
yellow and they won't admit 
it. I'm not yellow. Look at me, 
I was born in Luna City but 
look. I'm here in New York 
and I'm going back. I'm no 
viaphobe. They are, though, 
nearly all of them. They're 
scared to leave their little 
lump of rock and they won't 
even admit it. They're yellow, 
all of them.' ” 

“I didn't say anything 
like—” 

“You did.” 

On the point of protesting 
again, Clare changed her 
mind. Bill Adams was right. 

The people of Luna City 
were like an old hag who 
holds a sheet in front of her 
and says: “I'm the most 

beautiful woman in the 
world.” Clare had known bet- 
ter. The deceit had angered 
her. She had torn away the 
sheet. And now the old hag 
was revealed in all her naked 
ugliness.

wish,” Clare said quiet- 
ly, “someone had talked to 
me like that a long time ago. 
But, Bill — whatever my mo- 
tives were, I only told the 
truth. Someone had to. May- 
be viaphobia can be cured. 
But before it can be cured, 
youVe got to admit it exists.” 
“All right,” said Bill. “I ad- 
mit it. Now cure me.” 

For once Clare had nothing 
to say. 

C LARE was changing again 
under Father Adams' dis- 
approving eye when the 
phone rang. It was Em. 

“You should have warned 
me, Clare,” Em said. “Natur- 
ally it vv as a shock to see you 
like that.” 

“Still, Tm glad it was a 
pleasari shock,” Clare said. 

“Yes. Well. Fve been talk- 
ing to a few people and it’s 
going to be all right, Clare — 
nobody's going to take any 
action about that — that busi- 
ness long ago. Everybody 
seems to think that by com- 
ing back you’ve admitted you 
were wrong — ” 

“Huh?” said Clare. 

“Well, anyway, you’re for- 
given. You may even get 
your allowance back. So look, 
Clare, you’d better sort of 
make a public appearance. 
You’d better go to the ball to- 
night, I’ve had simply tons of 
invitations, but everybody will 
understand if I just go with 
you, without any escorts — ” 
“I’ve been asked already. 



Somebody called Tony Ben- 
son. Know him?” 

For a moment there was si- 
lence. Then Em screamed : 
“Tony! You knew, you must 
have known. Clare, vou — you 
bitch!” 

There was a click, then si- 
lence. 

Tony might, Clare thought, 
have told her. 

It hadn’t been entirely an 
accident that Clare had ar- 
rived in Luna City on the eve 
of the Adams Festival. Once, 
long ago, even before the via- 
phobe investigation and long 
before Clare committed her 
notorious act of sacrilege, she 
and Em had taken part in the 
Festival Queen contest. Em 
had been placed fourth. 
Clare . 

Well, why did they have to 
place everybody, right down 
the list? Surely they could 
have named the first six. But 
no, they had to number them 
all, one to twenty-seven. 

Clare had been number 
twenty-seven. 

She was complacently 
aware she wouldn’t be placed 
twenty-seventh now, on looks. 
But there was, of course, 
more to it than looks, so much 
more that it hadn’t crossed 
her mind to try to enter the 
contest again, even if they 
would let her. After what she 
had done, Clare Vernon could 
never be an Adams Festival 
Queen. 

No, what she meant to do 
was look as lovely and as cos- 



72 



j. T. McIntosh 




mopolitan as possible and 
show everybody that it hadn’t 
done her any harm to place 
twenty-seventh out of twenty- 
seven all those years ago, 
when she cared about such 
things. 

Her entrance with Tony 
that night was all she could 
have wished. A score of re- 
porters and photographers 
were waiting for her at the 
Colquhoun Hall, and Clare 
smiled as the cameras clicked, 
knowing she had never looked 
better in her life. 

Her gown was a Scyllan 
creation. The cut didn’t mat- 
ter so long as it was perfect, 
which it was. No girl at the 
ball was more modestly cov- 
ered, yet no girl was more 
flamboyantly dressed. This 
was one of the occasions 
when Clare meant to be flam- 
boyant. 

The iridescent material of 
the gown split the color of the 
light into its elements, flash- 
ing through them unceasing- 
ly as Clare moved, even as she 
breathed, so that nobody had 
any idea what color her gown 
really was. It was breathtak- 
ing. A goddess might have 
worn such a gown. 

John had given it to her on 
their seventh anniversary. 

was that what 

^ you wanted?” Tony 
murmured in her ear as the 
photographers fought for the 
best angles. 

*'Oh, it’s really nothing,” 



Clare murmured back. “Cleo- 
patra would have caused 
twice as much fuss.” 

Tony was a good dancer, 
much better than John. And 
when he surrendered her oc- 
casionally, Clare found that 
all the men wanted to dance 
with her. Apparently she was 
forgiven. Indeed, the whole 
evening looked like being a 
triumph. 

“If you want to succeed in 
Luna City, paint Judge 
Adams yellow,” Tony mur- 
mured to her once. 

Curiously, Clare wasn’t en- 
tirely happy. There was the 
matter of Em, for one thing. 
She was there, in a much too 
revealing gown, not paying 
the slightest attention to 
either Clare or Tony. 

And the better Clare was 
treated in Luna City, the 
more contemptible she felt. 
She hadn’t forgotten what 
Bill Adams had said. She 
never would. 

She knew the truth about 
herself. After all these years 
she knew the truth. 

She had placed twenty-sev- 
enth in the Festival Queen 
contest. To get back at them, 
she had gone to Earth boast- 
ing that she was no viaphobe 
and that nearly everybody 
else in Luna City was. She 
had insulted Luna City and 
left it forever. 

And when she came back, 
they treated her as a conquer- 
ing heroine. 

Even Judge Adams nodded 

73 



RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 




to her civilly, if not with any; 
pretense of warmth. And she 
danced with Bill Adams twice. 
He, too, was a good dancer. 
In Luna City everybody was 
good at things like that. 

She liked Bill. She liked Bill 
better than Tony Benson, now 
that she knew them both bet- 
ter. Tony had asked her to 
the ball because he had guess- 
ed shrewdly even then that 
she'd be in the limelight, and 
Tony liked to be in the lime- 
light. Besides, Tony had 
spent half the evening so far 
talking about his mother, and 
in Clare's opinion, men of 
twenty-^hve who spent a lot of 
time talking about their 
mothers were not for her. 

Bill had the beautiful man- 
ners of rather shy people, and 
already he was sorry for hav- 
ing spoken so bluntly to her. 

'T'm glad you did. Bill," 
she told him as they danced. 
‘T deserved eveiy word of it." 

Bill flushed and missed a 
step. ''I shouldn't have said 
it." 

“Of course you should. 
Why aren't more people like 
you? I did what I did because 
so many Lunans are via- 
phobes and won't admit it, 
and yet seem to think it 
makes them something spe- 
cial." 

The dance ended. “It was 
natural, Clare," Bill said. 
“All the same, you shouldn't 
have painted Henry Robert 
yellow because most of us 
happen to be viaphobes." 



«I didn't,” said Clare. "I 
did it because three fellows 
beat me up for what I'd said. 
Viaphobia apart, they were 
yellow." 

“I didn't know that. I think 
I understand, Clare." 

T he high spot of the eve- 
ning was the Festival 
Queen contest. Next day the 
girl chosen would preside at 
a score of festival events. She 
would open some new build- 
ings, present prizes at sport 
events, dive in first at the 
gala (any excuse to get her 
into a swimsuit was better 
than none) , and put in an ap- 
pearance at all the major 
celebrations. 

Clare didn't miss Tony's 
frown as Em paraded past. 
“What's eating you?" she 
whispered to him. “Was it a 
quarrel?" 

“1 asked her not to enter," 
Tony said. 

“Why not?" 

“I said she ought to leave 
things like this to teen- 
agers." 

“She must have loved that." 
Tony made no reply. He 
continued to frown at Em. 

Clare could see no reason 
why Em shouldn't enter the 
contest. Youth lasted long in 
a placid environment like 
Luna City. Em at thirty-two 
was at no disadvantage with 
the other girls in the parade. 
Clare hoped she won, and 
didn’t think it at all unlikely 
that she would. If Em won. 



74 



j. T. McIntosh 




there would be peace between 
her and Clare. 

At last Judge Adams came 
to the microphone to an- 
nounce the winner. He took 
the paper that was handed to 
him, started, glared at Em 
and then at Clare, and step- 
ped away from the micro- 
phone to argue with someone. 

“Well,’' said Clare, “don't 
you know what that means?" 

Tony's frown changed to 
puzzlement. “They can't have 
chosen Em," he said. “Not 
Em, Mother says ..." 

Clare sighed. Em was in 
love with him — anybody 
could see that. It was easy to 
guess, too, that his relations 
with Em hadn't been strictly 
platonic. And like all men, 
Tony thought very little of 
anything he could easily 
have, and yearned for the un- 
attainable. 

He couldn't have Clare, for 
example. Sooner or later she'd 
try to forget John, but it 
would be a long time before 
any man could engage her 
full attention. And when that 
happened, she had no inten- 
tion of stealing her sister's 
man — wliatever Em might 
think. 

Judge Adams was still 
arguing. Bill Adams was com- 
ing toward Clare. He had an 
envelope in his hand. 

“This just arrived," he 
said, giving it to Clare. “I 
told them I'd find you and de- 
liver it." 

“Thanks, Bill," said Clare. 
RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



From his curious expression, 
she could tell that he knew 
what the wire was about. 

She tore it open. Decree nisi 
granted. John. 

Well, that was that. Nisi 
didn't mean much when the 
two parties were separated by 
umpteen light-years. 

Judge Adams, his face red, 
was at the microphone again. 
“It has been decided," he said 
shortly, “that the duties of 
the Festival Queen will be 
shared by Clare and Emma 
Vernon." 

C LARE was at a loss. She 
hadn't even entered the 
contest. Dimly she was aware 
that the announcement was 
getting a mixed reception. 
There were some boos, a 
great deal of whispering, and 
the applause sounded like a 
few people trying to make up 
for the rest. 

Em turned and stared at 
Clare, and Clare realized that 
Em was already beginning to 
blame her for having cut in 
on an honor which should 
have been Em's alone. 

Clare stepped forward 
quickly. “I appreciate the hon- 
or," she said, “but I should 
like to withdraw in my sis- 
ter's favor." 

The whispering swelled to 
a roar. Public opinion crys- 
tallized, and Judge Adams, 
still red in the face, expressed 
it. 

“I'm not surprised," he 
said angrily. “Everybody 

75 




knows what you think of our 
founder and the Adams Fes- 
tival and Luna City and 
everybody in it.” 

'‘I said I appreciated the 
honor,” Clare repeated. But 
the uproar increased still 
more, and she cried : ‘‘All 
right! I accept!” 

There was sudden silence. 
Someone started to clap. Em 
was pushed forward and 
turned to stand on the other 
side of Judge Adams from 
Clare. The two girls were cer- 
tainly an attractive couple, 
alike yet not alike. Everj^body 
decided the easiest thing to do 
was applaud, and did so. 

In the confusion that fol- 
lowed, Clare had time for 
only a quick word with Tony. 
She was amused and exasper- 
ated to find that it was all 
right for Clare to be Festival 
Queen, but that he still hadn't 
changed his opinion about 
Em. And, of course, Mother 
wouldn't like it. 

There was an awkward mo- 
ment when the reporters ask- 
ed her what she thought of 
viaphobia now. 

“What's that got to do with 
it?” she inquired. 

It was an unfortunate ques- 
tion. A dozen people were 
ready to explain — and she 
knew the answer anyway. 

You couldn't take part in 
an Adams Festival if you 
were a heretic — if you be- 
lieved that Luna City was a 
sanitorium for neurotics. You 
had to recant. 



But how could she recant? 
How could she say black was 
white? 

She looked for Bill Adams, 
and couldn't see him. 

“I've got nothing to say on 
that subject,” she said firmly. 

That wouldn't do. There 
was a clamor and Clare real- 
ized that she'd have to make 
up her mind on the spot. 

Some young people like 
Bill Adams were prepared to 
admit privately that viapho- 
bia existed, that it was a 
crippling disease, that many 
of the citizens of Luna City 
would go elsewhere if they 
could. However, publicly you 
couldn't say any such thing. 

If you were going to stay 
in Luna City, you had to con- 
form. You could believe what 
you liked, but publicly you 
had to agree with everybody 
else. 

There was no such thing as 
viaphobia. 

Was she going to stay in 
Luna City? 

T he wire was in her hand- 
bag. Decree nisi granted. 
John. Well, wasn't she going 
to stay in Luna City? 

Then another thing struck 
her. The judges had chosen 
her as joint Festival Queen. 
They had known they were 
bestowing a great honor on 
her when they did so. 

Luna City could hardly 
have been more forgiving, 
more kind, when the prodigal 
daughter returned.

‘‘Viaphobia?” she said. 
“What’s that?" 

J OHN’S timing had always 
been bad. That wasn’t 
why they had quarreled, but 
it was certainly the reason 
why this last breach had 
never been healed. The right 
word at the right time . 
even the wrong word at the 
right time might have served. 
But he’d always picked the 
wrong time. 

It was hardly to be expect- 
ed that from Scylla his tim- 
ing would be any better. 

The second wire arrived 
just as Clare was leaving Col- 
quhoun Hall with Tony. It 
read: Forget last wire. Please 
come hack, John, 

Clare stuffed it in her 
handbag. It was too late. She 
had been telling herself for 
hours that life in Luna City 
had a lot to offer, and she’d 
finally convinced herself. John 
had kept up his record. Just 
an hour or so before asking 
her to come back, he had sent 
a snide wire telling her he’d 
arranged the divorce. 

And Clare had thrown in 
her lot with Luna City. She 
wasn’t going to change her 
mind again. 

It was always the same 
with John. If she went back, 
within six months she’d be 
on the point of leaving him 
again — and John would say 
the wrong word at the wrong 
time. 

Luna City had one thing to 
RETURN OF A PRODIGAL 



offer which Clare, at the ad- 
vanced age of twenty-eight, 
was beginning to appreciate. 

There might have been 
some doubt about it before, 
but now that she’d been chos- 
en joint Festival Queen, there 
was no doubt she would get 
her due share of the loot. She 
was reinstated. She was se- 
cure. 

“What’s that you’ve got 
there?’’ Tony asked. 

“Nothing," she said, snap- 
ping her handbag shut. 

She wouldn’t let him come 
further through the dark- 
ened streets with her than 
Adams Square. She let him 
kiss her once, then held him 
off. 

“Look, Tony," she said. 
“Em’s crazy about you. If I’d 
known that. I’d never have 
gone with you." 

“Em hasn’t got much 
chance with me or anybody 
else while you’re around," 
said Tony, and reached for 
her again. 

“Good night, Tony," said 
Clare firmly. She meant good- 
by. If she had to have some- 
body take her around, she 
didn’t think it would be hard 
to enroll Bill Adams. 

She turned away, cutting 
across the square. 

Abruptly half a dozen dark 
figures detached themselves 
from the shadows around the 
base of the column. 

“You needn’t think you’re 
going to be Festival Queen 
tomorrow," said a muffled 

77 




voice under a mask. “Your 
looks won't be up to it." 

And as Clare drew a breath 
to scream, one of the men 
knocked her navel back six 
inches. Another fist found her 
mouth and she felt her lip 
spurt blood. Somebody else 
hit her in the left eye and she 
knew at once it would be all 
the colors of the rainbow the 
next day. 

But that was all they could 
do to her. This wasn’t the 
Clare Vernon who had been 
beaten up in the same city ten 
years before. Besides, the six 
men around her were attuned 
to a gravity one-seventh that 
of Scylla. 

Despite her long skirt Clare 
was away like a hare escap- 
ing from six turtles, and she 
didn’t stop until she was in 
her hotel bedroom, panting 
but reasonably triumphant. 

Shiner or no shiner, she’d 
appear with Em tomorrow as 
Festival Queen. She caught 
Henry Robert’s eye through 
the window and nodded grim- 
ly to him. 

“Call off your boys, Father 
Adams,’’ she said aloud. “Un- 
til that happened, I was 

ashamed of myself. But when 
six men try to beat up one 
girl, I don’t need to be 

ashamed any more. I’ll be 

Festival Queen tomorrow just 
to spite you.’’ 

B ut she couldn’t sleep. How 
many world-shattering in- 
cidents have happened, or 



not happened, because some- 
body couldn’t sleep? 

And when the six A.M. 
starship landed at the Mare 
Imbrium terminal, Clare Ver- 
non and all her bags were 
waiting for it. 

Second Officer Jones was 
startled for only a moment. 
Then his face registered de- 
light. “Might have known 
you couldn’t take it for long. 
Miss Vernon,’’ he said. 

“Might have known," Clare 
agreed. “Mr. Jones, I’ve got 
bad news for you. I’m going 
back to my husband." 

Jones’s jaw dropped. “Hus- 
band? You never said any- 
thing about any husband." 

“No," Clare sighed. “You 
don’t when you’ve left him 
forever. But you see, Mr. 
Jones, I was wrong. Wrong 
about everything. Wrong 
about John. Wrong about 
Luna City. Wrong about via- 
phobia." 

Hui*t and disillusioned. 
Second Officer Jones said 
nothing. 

“They know about viapho- 
bia," said Clare thoughtfully, 
“and they don’t fight it. They 
accept it. Luna City is a won- 
derful place — you’re shelter- 
ed from everything. I didn’t 
know it then, but when I 
came back I wanted shelter 
too. Shelter from misunder- 
standings, quarrels . shel- 
ter from life. You don’t have 
to be a viaphobe to want to 
be where it’s warm and safe 
and comfortable and nobody

ever hurts you so long as you 
don’t hurt them by telling 
them you see through 
them . , 

“So you were married all 
the time,” said Second Officer 
Jones indignantly, disgusted 
afresh at the perfidy of wom- 
en. 

“Are you sorry, Mr. Jones? 
Don’t be. I’m going back to 
argue with John, and misun- 
derstand him, and be mis- 
understood by him, and wish 
I’d never met him . but at 
least I’m not going to take 
shelter from him. As you once 
said, Mr. Jones, I’m no via- 
phobe,” 

“I’ll have your bags stowed, 
Miss Vernon,” said the offi- 
cer, his nose in the air. 

“What, still hurt, Mr. 
Jones? After all we’ve meant 
to each other?” 

Second Officer Jones stalk- 
ed oflf to sulk, and Clare re- 
flectively restored the ring to 
the third finger of her left 
hand. 

It was strange, after what 
she’d been saying to Jones, 
that she felt happy and sure 
of herself again and could 
hardly wait for the ship to get 
back to Scylla. 



J UDGE Adams awakened, as 
he always did, when the 
lights came on to create Luna 
City’s artificial dawn. 

He got out of bed, yawn- 
ing, and cleared his throat 
noisily. Still only half awake, 
he was dimly aware of some- 
thing that was going to make 
this day worse than most 
days. 

Then he remembered. It 
was Adams Festival Day, and 
Clare Vernon was going to be 
joint Festival Queen. He 
didn’t mind about Em. If 
only those fool judges had 
picked Em without some 
genius thinking of the bril- 
liant scheme of having two 
Queens, and one of them 
Clare Vernon. If only she 
would fall downstairs and 
break a leg. 

If only . 

Something caught his eye 
and he staggered to the win- 
dow. He blinked, unable to 
believe his eyes. 

Then he roared with the 
rage of a mad elephant. 

Someone had climbed up 
the column and painted Hen- 
ry Robert Colquhoun Adams 
yellow.

the gelzek business 

By WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 



He was the luckiest guy in the Galaxy 



— until I got luckier than he ever tvasl 



W HEN Tad Peters met me 
at the spaceport at An- 
tarv, he had lost none of his 
old exuberance. As he shook 
ray hand he clapped me on the 
shoulder. 

“Glad you could make it, 
Al!” He waved toward the 
customs barrier. “I’ll get you 
through. I’ve got plenty of pull 
around here.” 

“I’m lucky I could come,” I 

81 



said as he dragged me along. 
“Took almost my last credit.” 
He glanced at me sidelong. 
“That way, eh? What happen- 
ed to your mining deal ?” 

“Fell through.” 

As we got my sparse bag- 
gage through the customs, I 
had more time to look at him. 
Still the old Tad Peters. The 
same sweeping gestures and 
booming voice — but had he 




aged in the two years since I’d 
seen him? 

Within minutes we were out 
on the pink marble concourse, 
climbing aboard an aircar that 
must have been the most ex- 
pensive available. 

“You look as though you’ve 
fallen on your feet,” I said. 

“I have, Al, I have. In the 
last six months, thirty-eight 
ships calling here have been 
fitted with Peters Deep-space 
Radar. Completely new princi- 
ple.” 

“Your invention?” 

“I built the lot of them. Got 
universal patents pending.” 

“I didn’t know you knew 
anything about radar. You 
actually invented this?” 

“Wellj sort of. Basically an 
idea I picked up from my girl 
friend. Luanu.” He switched 
on the antigravs, and the air- 
car lifted in a soaring arc 
above the great sprawling 
buildings of the starport. “I’m 
marrying her soon. She’s ter- 
rific, boy, terrific! But you’ll 
see her for yourself in a few 
minutes.” 

“When did you meet her?” 
“About a year ago — in Has- 
tek. Heard of it? Didn’t think 
so — it’s an outpost planet 
away in toward the Hub.” 

For a while he was silent 
as we sped southward above 
the shimmering towers lining 
the broad esplanade, skirting 
a sea flame-tipped beneath the 
swollen crimson disc of An- 
tares. Then he gave me a quick 
glance. 

82 



“You’ll like Luanu. She’s 
different.” 

H e skimmed down to a 
landing under the wing- 
like carport of a new, striking 
house on a promontory jutting 
out from the coast. As I step- 
ped out of the aircar onto a 
terrace of translucent stone in 
which waves of sapphire and 
emerald flame rippled, I 
breathed deeply. The air was 
fresh and cool, with the intoxi- 
cating tingle of more than a 
quarter oxygen mingling with 
the salt tang of the floating 
marine vegetation that dap- 
pled the red-lit sea with 
patches of smoky violet. 

“Quite a place you have 
here,” I said, looking up at the 
sweeping facade of the house. 
“I like it,” Tad said. 

“Bit different from the 
dump we lived in behind the 
ore-crushing plant at Port 
Mondo ! Remember when they 
took our air-conditioner back, 
that day when the tempera- 
ture was a hundred and 
thirty?” 

He shuddered. “Please, Al. 
Let’s leave the past behind 
us.” 

He led the way into the 
house. The furnishings, the 
murals, all the decor had a 
queer, outlandish touch that 
suggested some kind of alien 
temple. I stopped just inside 
the door and looked about me. 

“Like it?” boomed Tad, 
standing with his feet apart 
and his fists on his hips. 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




“Sure — in a way. But it 
isn’t like you, somehow.” 

“Well, it’s mostly Luanu’s 
choice. She should be here any 
minute.” 

“I’m here right now.” 

I’ll never forget that voice. 
Flexible and vibrant, somehow 
cool and warm at the same 
time, with something within it 
that made me think of fran- 
gipani and the night breeze 
through palm trees. I turned. 

She was standing in the 
doorway behind us. 

Different, he’d said ! 

It was the understatement 
of a lifetime. She was slender 
and tall, taller than either Tad 
or myself, though we were 
both above average height ; 
but it wasn’t her height or her 
build that made me stand 
there with my mouth open. 
The hair that fell in thick 
waves to her shoulders was 
golden, but with a green tint 
that I’d never seen before, 
although it looked natural, 
like the green-tinged pallor of 
her skin. Broad forehead, 
pointed chin, huge up\^ard- 
slanting eyes as green as 
emerald — everything about 
her had an effect of unseizable 
strangeness, yet at the same 
time a weird beauty. 

“Can I get you something 
to drink?” Her voice lifted 
with the hint of some odd ac- 
cent. 

Tad said something, and she 
smiled and glided into an ad- 
joining room, her movements 
swift and fluid and silent. I 



suddenly realized that I was 
still standing with my eyes 
and mouth wide open. 

“You’ll like Luanu,” said 
Tad. “Everyone does.” 
“Where did she come from?” 
I asked. 

“I met her in Hastdc. 
It’s—” 

“I know. In toward the Hub 
of the Galaxy, But where did 
she come from originally?” 
His eyes skittered away 
from mine. “I think she’s from 
one of the planets of the Vo- 
rand Empire.” 

“The what?” 

He made a vague gesture. 
“Away in toward the Hub, 
past the Lagoon Nebula.” 

“But that’s more than a 
thousand parsecs away!” 

“I know. I’ve never been 
there. The — er — the Vorani 
had space travel before we 
discovered fire. That’s why the 
first contacts with them put 
the Federation in a spin a 
couple of years back — or had 
you not heard about that? It’s 
lucky the two spheres of influ- 
ence are so far apart.” 

I looked at the door through 
which the girl had gone. “You 
mean she’s — she’s not — ” 
“Human? Well, I suppose it 
depends on your viewpoint. 
The Vorani would say we were 
not exactly human.” He gave 
an odd little laugh. “After all, 
what is a human being?” 

A t this point Luanu swept 
back into the room, hold- 
ing a tray with three frail- 



THE GELZEK BUSINESS

looking goblets sparkling with 
ruby liquid. She leaned toward 
me and I caught the suggestion 
of an unfamiliar perfume. Her 
full lips had an almost violet 
coloring. As I took one of the 
goblets, I found my hand was 
trembling slightly. 

She whirled toward Tad. 
“Let’s go down to Donelli’s.” 

“I thought we’d decided to 
eat here,” he said. 

“I’ve changed my mind.” 
Tad drained his glass al- 
most at a gulp. “O.K.,” he said 
in a slightly resigned tone. 
“We’ll go to Donelli’s.” 

Within minutes, the three 
of us were in the aircar, skim- 
ming further southward along 
the coast. The sun was setting, 
its vast red disk leering 
through dark slats of cloud 
beyond a saw-toothed ridge 
across the bay. Donelli’s was 
a bizarre, ultra-modern build- 
ing on a small peninsula al- 
most level with the sea, with 
the surf lapping the rocks on 
three sides of it. 

We sat at a table overlook- 
ing the water. Beside it, a 
broad dance floor of black ob- 
sidian swept in an irregular 
curving shape, the transpar- 
ent walls giving it the effect 
of being open to the sea air. 
A few couples were dancing to 
the surging music that filled 
the room from no visible 
source. Tad, who had been 
quiet since he had last spoken 
to Luanu, began to recover 
his air of enthusiasm. 

“Business is sure going 



well,” he said with intense sat- 
isfaction, leaning across the 
table. 

Luanu flashed him a side- 
long glance. “It would be bet- 
ter if we were making gel- 
zeks,” she said. 

“What’s a gelzek?” I asked, 
but neither or them gave any 
indication of hearing me. 

“Don’t let’s start that 
again,” Tad burst out irrita- 
bly. 

The girl’s eyes widened, the 
pupils dilating into black pools 
of sudden anger. “You’re a 
fool!” She almost spat the 
words at him, and then, as 
abruptly as it had come, her 
surge of anger vanished. She 
looked at me with a silvery 
laugh. “Don’t mind us, Al. Tad 
can’t help being stupid.” 

Tad’s face was flushed. 
“Look,” he appealed to me, 
“here we are with orders for 
radar units flooding in, just 
coming up to the crest of the 
wave — and she wants to drop 
everything to make gelzeks.” 

“But what is a gelzek?” I 
persisted. 

His rage seemed to be 
mounting to the flash-point. 
‘7 don’t know! Ask Luanu!” 

1 REPEATED my question 
to her, but she shook her 
head. “I’m afraid I can’t ex- 
plain it without building one,” 
she said. Her eyes glinted at 
Tad. “You trusted me with the 
radar. Why do you doubt me 
when I tell you about the gel- 
zeks?” 



84 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




"Because you can't explain 
what they're for ! All you say 
is that the gelzek makes possi- 
ble a different way of life." 

"And that's true. You'll 
see." 

His mouth opened, then 
closed like a trap. "We stick 
to making radar," he said with 
forced calm. 

She sat looking at him for a 
few seconds, and then she 
stood up. Without saying a 
word to either of us, she strode 
across the floor and out 
through the foyer. I looked 
questioningly at Tad, but he 
picked up his glass and drain- 
ed it before meeting my eyes. 

"She'll be back," he said, 
then added uncertainly: "I 
think." For a long time he sat 
staring down at the table, his 
fingers drumming in quite dif- 
ferent time from the music, as 
though he were completely 
unaware of his surroundings. 

"Are all the Vorani as tem- 
peramental as that?" I asked. 

"Eh? Oh, I don't know. I 
never met any others." He 
looked across at the sunset. 
"Very few people have." 

I thought that one over for 
a moment, then decided not to 
follow it up just yet; Tad 
didn't seem in any mood to 
talk. I looked around the dance 
floor and its surrounding 
tables. When we had come in 
with Luanu a few minutes 
ago, the place had seemed big 
and friendly and sparkling 
with glamor. Now it was only 
big. 



T ad drove me back into the 
center of Antarv and park- 
ed the aircar on the landing 
wing of a gigantic hotel facing 
the esplanade. 

"I stayed here when I first 
arrived," he said. 

I looked up at the gleaming 
facade of metal, reddened by 
the last rays of the sunset. 
"Say, this looks a bit expen- 
sive for me. I told you I was 
nearly down to my last credit." 

His old manner returned for 
a moment like the first gust of 
a rising gale. "Al, old boy, I 
forgot. Here !" He pulled out a 
wallet, peeling a number of 
green ten-credit bills from a 
thick roll. "That should see 
you through. Think nothing of 
it. Everything's going to be all 
right. Luanu Will be back." 

He said it as though the last 
two facts were closely con- 
nected, and immediately after- 
ward he seemed to sink into 
gloom again. As he said good- 
by his eyes were focused be- 
yond me, with the expression 
of a man who is seeing some- 
thing he doesn't like. 

I shrugged and went up to 
bed. 

The days and nights on An- 
tarv are short, and when I 
awoke the giant red sun was 
already throwing its lurid 
glare over the city. The build- 
ings cast a pattern of green- 
edged shadows. I had break- 
fast in the cafe on the top floor 
of the hotel, with a view over 
the esplanade and the sea. 
Following the map Tad had 

85 



THE GELZEK BUSINESS 




given me, I rode the beltways 
out to the edge of the city and 
located his factory — a long, 
plain building of recent con- 
struction. I found Tad in his 
office, sitting behind a large 
desk. He looked as if he hadn’t 
slept. 

“I can’t find her,” he said as 
soon as I was in the room. 
“She’ll be back,” I told him. 
“I’m not so sure, Al. I’m 
not sure at all.” He got up 
sloiwly, and as he walked 
across to look at a production- 
flow chart on one wall, his step 
seemed heavy. “She’s an un- 
predictable girl. Brilliant but 
wild. And if she walks out at 
this stage, we’re sunk.” 
“Maybe there’s something 
I haven’t got straight. Tad,” 
I said. "Didn’t you say you’d 
already fitted thirty-eight 
ships with your radar in the 
last six months?” 

“Well, they’re all wired up 
and the heavy gear is in place. 
But they still have to be fitted 
with roto-azimuth integrators 
before they’ll function.” 
“What’s a roto-azimuth in- 
tegrator?” 

“It’s a thing about so big.” 
He made gestures with his 
hands. “We had one on the 
demonstration ship and it 
worked fine. Sold all these 
orders with it. Then it burned 
out.” 

“Can’t you build another?” 
“Luanu’s been working on 
it. We went ahead with all the 
rest of the installations, but 
she hasn’t finished it yet.” He 

86 



sat heavily down at his desk, 
fiddling with a six-color pen, 
his eyes far away and glazed. 

“Well,” I said heartily, “if 
she made one, she can make 
another.” 

“I think the first one was 
made somewhere in the Vo- 
rand Empire,” he said, 
thoughtfully writing some- 
thing on his desk pad. “I hope 
she knows what was inside it. 
I don’t.” 

He drew two lines on the 
pad, then two others crossing 
them. Very deliberately, he be- 
gan putting zeroes and crosses 
in the squares, finally drawing 
a line through three zeroes and 
sourly studying the result. I 
moved toward the door. 

“I’ll see you sometime when 
you’re not tied up,” I said. 

He looked at me as if he had 
forgotten I was there. “Yes, 
do that, Steve — I mean Al.” 

When he started drawing 
more lines on the pad, I went 
out. 

S EVERAL times in the next 
few days I tried to call up 
Tad on the visiphone, but on 
each occasion I was told that 
he was out of town. Nobody 
knew when he would be back. 
Once I went out to his office, 
only to find three other men 
there who had been trying for 
days to trace him. 

After ten days a long-dis- 
tance call came through to me 
at my hotel, and when I an- 
swered it, Luanu’s face smiled 
at me from the screen.

"Al, I wanted to see you 
again,” she said. 

'‘Where are you? When are 
you coming back?” 

'Tm never coming back — 
not to Tad. We simply don't 
get along together. But I want 
you to help me.” 

"How?” I asked. 

Her eyes sparkled. "Making 
Gelzeks. I've found a factory 
that will be ideal and I've al- 
ready got a lot of the mate- 
rials. I want you to help me 
run the factory.” 

"But why me?” 

"Because I like you. Need 
any other reason?” 

For a long time I examined 
the brilliant eyes, the full, 
curving mouth. "No,” I said. 
"Where can I find you?” 

"You mustn't tell Tad.” 

"I won't.” 

She frowned at me for a few 
seconds. "All right. I'll tell you 
where to find me,” she said, 
and she did. 

It was a long journey to 
Pavo City, up over the white- 
fanged peaks of the Equatorial 
Range and on over a thousand 
miles of flat yellow plain 
trenched by muddy, winding 
rivers to the shore of the In- 
land Sea. The aircraft was a 
primitive flying triangle and I 
was glad to step out of it onto 
the sun-scorched tarmac. 

Pavo City was old, with 
many of its buildings of patch- 
ed gray concrete, some of them 
in ruins. It had passed its peak 
centuries ago, when the near- 
by mines had been worked out. 

THE GELZEK BUSINESS 



Luanu met me at the air- 
port, very tall and slender in 
a long hooded cloak of some 
heat-reflecting material, her 
eyes shining within the dark 
shadow of the hood. She led 
me to a small groundcar, and 
a few minutes later we were 
weaving through twisting, 
narrow streets crowded with 
buildings that represented 
many successive eras of archi- 
tectural style, some of metal, 
some of concrete, some even of 
yellow brick. 

T he factory was a' long, 
bare building on the out- 
skirts of the town, adjoining 
a landing field that served a 
number of similar buildings 
which appeared to be disused. 
Luanu parked the car and led 
the way into the office block. 

She must have been working 
hard in the last few days — she 
showed me a number of in- 
credibly complex drawings 
which I didn't begin to under- 
stand even after poring over 
them for several minutes. The 
maze of differently colored 
lines and symbols that covered 
them were completely incom- 
prehensible to me. 

"This,” she said, waving a 
sliih hand to the drawings, "is 
the gelzek. With it, your whole 
civilization will never be the 
same again. Even after your 
people have been using it for 
a hundred years, they will still 
be finding new possibilities for 
applying it.” 

"I see,” I responded in a 

87 




tone that didn’t convince even 
myself. 

‘‘Come through here,” she 
said. 

I followed her into a large 
open space, at one side of 
which were a number of metal 
cabinets about the size of 
small household refrigerators. 

“These are gelzek cabinets,” 
she told me. “I had a few made 
by a firm near here; they 
seemed satisfactory enough, so 
Fve given them an order for 
ten thousand. It meant raising 
a substantial loan, but I man- 
aged to convince the bank peo- 
ple of the gelzek’s possibilities 
— not that they could under- 
stand h, but they at least had 
the deep-s}3ace radar as an in- 
dication of what we can do. 
But I war.t you to run this fac- 
tory with me.” 

“I don/t understand what 
we’re making yet,” I objected. 

“You don’t have to. I’ve 
planned the gelzek so it can be 
made in about twenty sub- 
assemblies. I can fix the 'most 
tricky ones, and we can sub- 
divide the rest of the circuits 
and parts into packaged units 
that an unskilled team can fit 
together.” 

As she stood there smiling, 
she looked very young. “You 
have got it well figured out,” 
I said. 

Her smile broadened. “We’ll 
make billions out of it.” 

I thought briefly, guiltily, of 
Tad sitting at his desk draw- 
ing zeroes and crosses on a 
pad. 



“Will you do it?” she asked. 
Well, after all, if this proj- 
ect came off. I’d be in a posi- 
tion to give Tad all the help he 
needed, wouldn’t I? I nodded. 
“O.K. But I wish you’d tell 
me — ” 

Her eyes danced impishly as 
she shook her head. 

1 FOUND a hotel overlooking 
the Inland Sea and booked 
a room. Within a week I had 
a team of twenty men and the 
factory was in production. 
Most of the employees never 
saw Luanu, and only one — 
Joe Parks, a scrawny little 
Earthborn engineer I had 
taken on as assistant manager 
— knew that it was not I who 
had been the sole driving force 
behind the whole project. 

Luanu was renting a house 
facing an enclosed courtyard 
next to the factory, and she 
had had a doorway made to 
link this with the laboratory 
connected to the office, so that 
she had a separate entrance. 
The fact that the city was 
half-deserted had made it fair- 
ly easy for her to find a com- 
bination of buildings that 
suited her purpose so well. 

Consignments of gelzek cab- 
inets began to pour into the 
unloading bay by the truck- 
load. Thousands of coils of 
thin insulated wire in various 
thicknesses began to fill the 
storage racks we had erected, 
together with uncounted vari- 
eties of transistors and other 
small parts.

Several times, Joe Parks 
asked me what the gelzek was 
for. Always, I evaded a direct 
answer, I told him it was 
highly secret, and he seemed 
a little upset by my failure to 
take him into full confidence. 
He suggested advance adver- 
tising and I said I had the 
matter in hand. 

“Which agency is handling 
the account?” he asked. 

I had to say something. 
“Pavo City Advertising Incor- 
porated.” 

“There’s no such firm in 
town.” He stepped back a 
pace, looking at me with a new 
wisdom. “Say — mind if I ask 
you something?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Do you know what you’re 
doing?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Look. I like working for 
you, Al. But I can’t work for 
a guy who doesn’t know what 
the hell he’s doing. Gelzeks! 
I tell my friends we’re making 
gelzeks, and they say to me: 
‘What’s a gelzek?’ And then 
I’ve got to tell them I don’t 
know. Do you know?” 

I stood up, walked around 
my desk and put a hand on his 
shoulder. “Joe, before I tell 
you, I want you to come with 
me.” 

I took him out into the en- 
closed courtyard and pressed 
the buzzer on Luanu’s front 
door. The door slid open al- 
most at once. 

“Come in, Al,” she called 
from within. 



I led Joe into the large room 
on the left. The broad tables 
were littered with delicate ap- 
paratus, and Luanu, in a plas- 
tic coverall, was busy working 
on some intricate, shimmering 
device with a thin electric sol- 
dering iron. When she saw I 
was not alone, she stood up, 
shaking back her hair with a 
toss of her head. 

“Joe,” I said, “I’d like you 
to meet — ” 

“Call me Luanu,” she said, 
and her smile seemed to dispel 
Joe’s irritation instantane- 
ously. 

“Joe wanted to know what 
a gelzek is for,” I explained. 

“Of course,” she said. “That 
is perfectly natural. You can 
go back to the office if you like, 
Al. I’ll explain things to Joe.” 

I went back to the office and 
sat looking at the latest batch 
of invoices for gelzek chassis, 
gelzek cabinets, gelzek infinite- 
ly variable transformers, and 
gelzek hyper - synchronized 
vector analyzers. Maybe Joe 
would find out a bit about 
what they were for. 

He was gone half an hour. 
When he came back he had a 
slightly dazed expression, but 
somehow he looked younger 
and more carefree. 

“Marvelous girl,” he said, 
his eyes shining. “I had no 
idea.” 

“Did she explain what the 
gelzek was for?” I asked 
guardedly. 

“Eh? Oh. I meant to ask 
her that.” Suddenly he shrug- 



THE GELZEK BUSINESS 



89 




ged his shoulders. ‘‘Still, what 
does it matter? She knows 
what she’s doing.” 

“Sure, Joe. She knows.” 

A bout the middle of the 
afternoon Luanu came in- 
to my office. “ A1 ! Tve finished 
it!” 

She put a glittering mass of 
coiled crystalline tubes and 
wires and transistors and 
delicate gears on my desk. 
“What is it?” I asked, 

“You might call it the gel- 
zek’s heart, or its brain,” she 
said proudly. “You know, Al, 
that’s the first thing I’ve ever 
really finished.” 

I looked at her with my jaw 
swinging loose on its hinges. 

“It’s true,” she said. “I’m 
always starting things, but 
this is the fii'st one I’ve really 
finished. Wait a few minutes 
until I assemble the compensa- 
tor and I’ll show you how it 
works.” 

She ran lightly out of the 
office, leaving me sitting star- 
ing at the thing on the desk. 
I was still looking at it five 
minutes later when Joe burst 
in. 

“Say,” he panted, “there’s a 
strange ship out on the land- 
ing field.” 

“Probably some new trans- 
port line,” I replied. 

“Not this thing. It’s — 
different/' 

I didn’t like the way he said 
it. I went with him to the open 
door and looked across the 
field. 



The machine out there was 
certainly different. Complete- 
ly, utterly unlike any aircraft 
or spacecraft I’d ever seen — 
and craft built for special pur- 
poses can take some strange 
shapes. This thing was about 
fifty or sixty feet long, blunt- 
ly rounded, finned, fish-shaped, 
blue, with an eerie shimmer 
about it that gave it the un- 
canny effect of being unreal, 
as if surrounded by some kind 
of field. 

There was a man near it — 
or was it some form of gigan- 
tic robot? Humanoid shape, 
but from this distance he look- 
ed about ten feet tall, unless 
something had gone radically 
wrong with my sense of per- 
spective. He was dressed in 
skintight blue stuff that look- 
ed like a film of metal, with a 
sort of haversack on his back. 
He reached over his shoulder 
and touched this, and he was 
flying. 

Just like that. No visible 
jets or air foils — nothing but 
that metal pack arrangement 
on his back. Yet he flew 
through the air, skimming to- 
ward us easily and swiftly. 

Joe was making strangled, 
gurgling noises. I tried to say 
something, but the words did 
not come. A moment later, the 
fantastic figure had landed 
lightly just outside the build- 
ing. 

There was nothing wrong 
with my eyes. The fellow ivas 
about ten feet tall. He looked 
down at me with huge emerald 



90 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




eyes that seemed shockingly 
familiar, though I couldn’t 
think why. 

“You are A1 Sandry.” He 
didn’t ask me. He told me. 

“That’s— that’s right,” I 
said. 

He made a sweeping move- 
ment with his arm. “Inside.” 

We went inside. Without 
any argument. Don’t ask me 
why. 'The guy was just like 
that. 

Anyway, have you ever 
tried arguing with a man ten 
feet high? 

Joe looked at me furtively. 
“I’ll — er — see to the unload- 
ing,” he said, and before I 
could stop him he was gone. 

I sat down behind my desk. 
“Take a seat,” I invited. 

T he stranger lifted the 
heavy electric typewriter 
off the table with one hand, 
putting it on top of a filing 
cabinet as if it had been a hat. 
He sat on the table, his feet 
squarely on the floor. 

“Where is Luanu?” His eyes 
seemed to see inside my head 
the way Luanu’s did some- 
times, and it Avas then that I 
realized why they looked fa- 
miliar. 

“I don’t know,” I said. 

His eyes took on a void, fix- 
ed look as though he were 
staring at something I couldn’t 
see. He sat like that for some 
seconds, then seemed to relax. 

“What are you making 
here ?” he asked. 

If anyone else had asked me 

THE GELZEK BUSINESS 



that, I would have had a rea- 
sonable answer. But not to this 
fellow. He just looked at me 
while I tried to say something. 
Then he leaned over and pick- 
ed up the device Luanu had 
left on the desk. He glanced at 
it, then stowed it into a kind 
of satchel at his side, his eyes 
holding mine. He reached over 
to the filing cabinet where we 
kept the drawings and pulled 
gently at the drawer, which 
was locked. He pulled a little 
harder. 

Part of the lock spanged off 
the ceiling and rattled across 
the floor. He pulled the drawer 
all the way out of the cabinet, 
put it on the table and riffled 
quickly through the drawings. 
Some — the ones on which 
Luanu had shown detailed 
connections — he took out, 
glanced at, and stuffed into his 
satchel. He looked at each 
drawing for no more than a 
second, yet I had the feeling 
he understood them at once. 

The whole thing took a mat- 
ter of seconds. When he had 
finished, he looked at me with 
those great catlike eyes. 

“I am Kordru, of Vorand,” 
he said. “Unfortunate if 
Luanu has disturbed you. Our 
children are sometimes irre- 
sponsible.” 

“Children?” I found my 
voice creaking like a rusty 
hinge. “You call Luanu a 
child?” 

“Of course. One day she will 
be almost as tall as I am. And, 
I hope, as mature.” 



91 




At this mom^t Luanu came 
in, her eyes wide. She stopped 
when she saw Kordru. It was 
the first and only time I ever 
saw her poise shattered. 

Kordru didn’t say anything 
to her, but he got his meaning 
across. He rose to his feet, his 
face stem and commanding, 
but with the faintest trace of 
amusement flickering in his 
eyes. 

Luanu turned to me. “I must 



apologize, Al. My father is 
taking me home.” 

The giant took her hand and 
led her to the door. She looked 
back at me over her shoulder. 

“It’s been fun, Al, hasn’t 
it?” 

And then they were gone. 

Fun? With all those bills I 
owed for parts of — of gelzeks? 

And that’s something I still 
haven’t found out. 

What is a gelzek? END 



HOW RESEARCH PAYS OFF 

It is said that when Arthur Dehon Little sought $50,000 in New Eng- 
land to obtain the American rights to the Cross & Bevan viscose process 
about 60 years ago, he was asked: *‘Do you mean to say. Dr. Little, that 
man can ever produce fibers as good as those God has provided us?” 
according to Industrial Research, a management-oriented magazine that 
covers 80 fields, which points out that the viscose process is the basis 
of the $420 million viscose rayon industry. 

Challenged by the general lack of technological vision. Dr. Little de- 
voted much of his life to preaching industry’s need for research. He 
wrote extensively about scientists — the Fifth Estate, he called them: 
‘'those having the simplicity to wonder, the ability to question, the power 
to generalize, the capacity to apply.” 

The experience of World War II gave the final impetus to industry’s 
gradual conversion to the research doctrine until today, when it is a 
brave board chairman who does not report some kind of research effort 
to his stockholders. 

“Research has meant the difference between growth and stagnation 
so that 90 cents out of every Minnesota Mining sales dollar now comes 
from products developed by research,” says 3-M president Herbert P. 
Buetow. Statements like this can be made of Dupont, RCA, and other 
research-based companies, which are offering products, processes and 
services that would surely have caused theological chaos scarcely more 
than half a century ago. What man cannot do has become so much less 
important than what man can do that a fantastic $12 billion will be 
spent on research next year — and Dr. Raymond H. Ewell, formerly of 
the National Science Foundation, has calculated that research , money 
yields an annual average of 100% to 200% over a 25-year period.

Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



E very now and then some 
writer produces a story 
which can be regarded as a 
definitive work. Heinlein did 
that with Universe, so explor- 
ing the possibilities of a 
multi-generation spaceship 
that that particular story 
need never be written again. 
T. L. Sherred did it for the 
rear-view time scanner in E 
for Effort, Huxley for the 
antlike, automated future in 
Brave Neiv World, There 
have been many stories writ- 
ten since on each of these sub- 
jects, some of them quite 
good, many of them fun, but 
they really have said nothing 
new about their themes. Noth- 
ing has been left by Heinlein, 
Sherred and Huxley to say. 

In The Falling Torch 
(Pyramid), Algis Budrys 
may have given us another 
such definitive story. 

Earth has been enslaved by 
invaders from another star's 
planets. They are human 
enough, barring a faint sal- 
lowness of complexion, but 
they aren't Earthmen and 
their total victory has driven 
Earth's government into ex- 
ile, from whence they mount 
a feeble, reckless but success- 
ful underground attack which 



ultimately liberates the planet. 
This is the story : The gov- 
ernment in exile, the under- 
ground, the successful revolu- 
tion. It happens that Budrys 
comes to this theme with a 
vast head start over his col- 
leagues. His father is a Free 
Lithuanian consul and Bud- 
rys himself has lived in the 
United States since early 
childhood on a diplomatic 
passport. Certainly this has 
been a help to him, but it 
doesn't account for the book's 
excellence. 

B UDRYS'S exiled govern- 
ment is a creation of char- 
acterization : The Prime 

Minister who is a master chef 
eight hours a day; the Secre- 
tary of Defense who sells in- 
surance; the exiled President 
Wi reman who rules them all 
on paper, yet lives in relative 
squalor. He must. Budrys tells 
us why : “Even Prime Min- 
isters could find ordinary 
work and bring no tarnish to 
the bright memory of Earth's 
freedom, but . the Presi- 
dent could not. The rest of 
them could admit in public 
that Earth was no longer 
there, but someone had to 
preserve the fiction — someone 



93 




had to embody the legal fable 
that the Government in Exile 
still represented the people — 
and Wireman was the man.” 
When the chosen agent of the 
exiles lands on Earth he meets 
an active though feeble un- 
derground. We find it invest- 
ed with the same scrupulously 
precise rightness. Perhaps 
some of it shows the mark of 
For Whom the Bell Tolls: 
much of it may have come 
from the stories of the Lithu- 
anian forest fighters. No mat- 
ter. The bulk of it is Budrys. 

Budrys shows us the great 
law of politics: No one makes 
weakness a gift of strength. 
He lets us perceive the barbs 
in the tempting bait other 
powers offer Earth's under- 
ground; he opens up the mo- 
tives of the partisan fighters, 
and shows us that they cancel 
out. What is left? The pro- 
tagonist. He is that invention 
of recent science fiction, a 
man who sees what must be 
done and does it, who comes 
within reach of a success and 
grasps it. He is a realized 
man. And The Falling Torch 
is a realized book. 

And yet there is this one 
thing. 

As a book. The Falling 
Torch earns high marks. As a 
science fiction book, it has the 
serious defect of hardly being 
science fiction. Change names 
and it becomes a story of mod- 
ern Lithuania, of World War 
II France — of any occupied 
country anywhere. 



This should not keep any- 
one from enjoying The Fall- 
ing Torch; the book is a 
winner. But one can't help 
feeling that it is running on 
the wrong track. 

F or contrast, what about C. 

P. Snow's The Search 
(Scribner's) or Pearl S. 
Buck's Command the Morn- 
ing (John Day) ? 

If we take for a rule that a 
science fiction story must con- 
tain some element of extra- 
polation, some one thing that 
could be true but isn't, then 
neither of them qualifies as 
science fiction. Yet surely 
they are fiction about science, 
as Budrys's book just as sure- 
ly is not. 

Sir Charles Snow first 
wrote The Search twenty-five 
years ago. This new, rewrit- 
ten edition, he says in a pref- 
ace, is published to help 
bridge the gap between Tech- 
nical Man and Lay Man. “It is 
very stupid to attempt to 
make everybody into tech- 
nologists, but it is essential 
that everybody, including 
the technologists themselves, 
should understand something 
of the intellectual and human 
meaning of what the tech- 
nologists are about.” It is in 
a way endearing of Sir 
Charles to offer an excuse for 
writing a book ; most writers 
merely bang them out. But 
perhaps it is not an excuse. 
The gap yawns between the 
man in the white collar and 



94 




the man in the laboratory 
smock, and a bridge is neces- 
sary. 

The Search does not span 
the void. Snow's hero, Arthur 
Miles, is quite believable and 
empathy evoking as a scien- 
tist and as a man. The science 
in the book, and there is a 
great deal of it, is technical 
enough to be exciting and 
cleverly presented enough to 
be entirely digestible. (It is a 
bit of a wrench that at one 
point Sir Charles gives the 
formula for sodium bromide 
as KBr. Slips happen ; Sir 
Charles was a good chemist 
before he became an even bet- 
ter writer.) 

B ut Arthur Miles is a sci- 
entist only so long as he 
is very successful at it, and 
then for just the few extra 
months after a disaster that 
it takes him to find some oth- 
er source of income. (He 
marries it.) The change in 
his character from bright 
young zealot to cynic is de- 
picted with complete skill. 
The book is a good book. But 
it is not the book we were 
promised in the preface. We 
have been offered a portrait; 
what we find is an expose. 

Miss Buck's book does not 
give us even an expose. This 
is fiction, but it is also at bot- 
tom fact, or is supposed to be, 
for if the names of the char- 
acters have been changed 
(Szilard becoming Szigny, 
Slotin becoming Feldman, 



Oppenheimer becoming, prob- 
ably, Burton Hall), the work 
they are all doing is the manu- 
facture of the atomic bomb. 
Command the Morning is 
probably the most glandular 
interpretation of the compli- 
cated motives of the bomb in- 
ventors ever to see print 
anywhere. They are supposed 
to be the brightest humans 
alive, but they talk and act 
like boobs. 

What is most interesting 
here about these two books, 
though, is not whether they 
are good or bad, but what 
keeps them outside the cate- 
gory '‘science fiction" while 
The Falling Torch must be 
admitted. Perhaps we should 
be liberal and call them all 
science fiction — of a sort. But 
that sort is only one of the 
varieties of the science fiction 
experience, and not the trans- 
cendental one which lifts us 
away from here and now — 
not to escape our lives, but to 
see them more clearly. 

A PURER form of science 
fiction is well exemplified 
in two new novels and a re- 
print. The reprint is Fred 
Hoyle's The Black Cloud 
(Signet), which not only 
gives us as luminous a por- 
trait of the technologist as Sir 
Charles Snow's but provides 
the technologist team with a 
dominating problem — the so- 
lution to which raises a 
larger problem still. 

Fred Hoyle, of course, is 

95 




the English astronomer whose 
Steady State Hypothesis has 
aroused such comment in the 
scientific world — much of it 
in the form of shrill, agonized 
screams. His thesis is that 
there was no ‘‘primordial 
ultimate atom'' which in 
bursting generated the atoms 
and the galaxies we know. In- 
stead, says Hoyle, old matter 
dies into energy and new 
matter is constantly born 
from energy; the universe is 
in a steady state where with- 
drawals continually balance 
deposits, so that what the 
stars burn up is regenerated 
in new gas clouds forming be- 
tween the galaxies. In The 
Black Cloud one such cloud 
invades the Solar System. 
What it is, and what Man 
does about it, is not merely an 
exciting story ; it is also a ve- 
hicle in which a man with 
fresh and important ideas can 
find a suitable pulpit from 
which to deliver them. 

In Hoyle's newer novel, 
Ossian's Ride (Harper), we 
have something quite differ- 
ent. In Ireland a mighty new 
technical power has appeared. 
Great cities are built, of 
materials that have never be- 
fore been seen. It is a wonder 
to the world, and naturally 
the world does its best to 
solve the mystery. In Dublin, 
now a very Lisbon for spies 
and plots, the hero of Ossian's 
Ride begins a Hitchcock jour- 
ney across bogs, up moun- 
tains and through storm-toss- 



ed seas to a mysterious 
island where all the answers 
are. 

This is fine cloak-and-dag- 
ger ; it has plausible and 
exciting characters and, above 
all, an informed foundation 
of fact. It is not only techni- 
cal fact, either, for Hoyle 
demonstrates that he knows a 
great deal about Ireland, 
about intrigue and about hu- 
man nature. Only in such 
faintly prissy literary conven- 
tions as the I - set - down - 
the - true - story - so - that - 
the - world - may - judge 
frame (present in Tho Black 
Cloud and retained in Ossian's 
Ride) does Hoyle display his 
academic disposition. Neither 
use of the frame serves any 
purpose, but neither matters 
very much; these are good 
books all the way through. 

P 3UL ANDERSON is not a 
scientist; he is a science 
fiction writer and one of the 
best. Still, he does hav^e a de- 
gree in physics and, like most 
of the better writers in the 
field, has made it his business 
to keep informed of what is 
going on in the area of sci- 
ence. His newest novel. The 
Enemy Stars (Lippincott) , 
shows why this is worth 
while. 

Matter transmitters operate 
amost instantaneously all 
over the Galaxy, says Ander- 
son, but for the matter to be 
ti*ansmitted, it must be re- 
ceived. This requires a receiv- 



96 




er. This requires a ship. And 
ships cannot exceed the speed 
of light — Einstein has seen to 
that. 

Therefore great rockets are 
sent out on hundred-year 
journeys, their principal cai’- 
go a matter transmitter, their 
crews a constant changing 
succession of thirty-day con- 
scripts. It is dull aboard a 
star rocket, but it is bearable ; 
once the thirty days are up, 
the old crew matter-transmits 
home, the new crew aboard. 

Except once. 

For our crew has an acci- 
dent. The matter transmitter 
is destroyed. All at once the 
four men are marooned. The 
only possible salvation lies in 
the repair of the matter trans- 
mitter, and that seems impos- 
sible. Is impossible, though it 
would hardly be fair here to 
discuss the rabbits Anderson 
pulls out of his hat to give the 
story an ending. It is a per- 
fectly splendid science fiction 
dilemma, and all its wonders 
are ingenious and enjoyable. 
Allow Anderson his matter 
transmitter and the rest of 
the story can be defended 
against any attack. 

Unfortunately the plot is 
only eenie meenie minie moe, 
who the heck is next to go? 
But for setting and theme the 
story has all that a proper 
science fiction story should. 

I N Encounter (Avalon), J. 

Hunter Holly gives us a 
mind-eating alien named Eze- 



kiel (he saw a Wheel)' who is 
as vulnerable as Achilles. His 
heel is cats. Bantam has just 
reissued Jer^ Sohl’s Point 
Ultimate (Rinehart) , which 
concerns a tight-fisted tyran- 
ny governing Earth, and a 
freedom revolt sparked by a 
Martian colony. It lacks very 
little of being a first-class 
science fiction adventure. The 
little it lacks is a single flesh- 
and-blood human character. 
In Starhaven (Ace), Ivar 
Jorgensen offers a routine but 
fast picture of an outlaw 
planet. The other half of the 
double volume is Edmond 
Hamilton’s The Sun Smasher, 
concerning the last of the 
galactic emperors and the 
weapon that can restore to 
him his throne. Voodoo Pkmet 
and Plague Ship (Ace) are 
both by Andrew North, and 
both are former Gnome Press 
juveniles. As juveniles they 
were fine. As presumptive 
adult fare, they still are ju- 
veniles. 

Brian Aldiss is perhaps the 
most promising new science 
fiction writer on the horizon, 
as anyone can plainly see by 
reading No Time Like Tomor- 
row (Signet), a collection of 
half a dozen very good stories 
and no very bad ones. His 
great virtue is the selection of 
the right word or phrase ; the 
defect of his virtue is that 
sometimes his precision be- 
comes precious. Aldiss is not 
afraid to tackle new and diffi- 
cult themes, either. But his 



97 




first novel, Vanguard from 
Alpha (Ace) is a spy-and- 
counterspy exercise which un- 
fortunately gives his well- 
drawn characters no problem 
more challenging than a hit 
on the head. It too is a double 
volume, the other being The 
Changeling Worlds, by Ken- 
neth Bulmer, concerning a 
culture of star-roving billion- 
aires whose big problem is 
that — passengers will please 
fasten seat belts — ^they don’t 
know where babies come 
from. Bulmer makes this 
more plausible than you 
would think by hard work and 
good writing, but how plausi- 
ble can it be made? 

Alan E. Nourse and J. A. 
Meyer give us a dictatorship 
which needs overthrowing in 
The Invaders Are Coming 
(Ace), and in spite of every- 
thing find freshness and ex- 
citement in the telling. Prob- 
ably most readers will have 
guessed page 187’s big secret 
no later than the second para- 
graph of page 17, but only 
because Nourse and Meyer 
play fair with their readers 
by using words exactly. 

P hilip K. dick is an ad- 
venturous sort of byline 
for the science fiction reader, 
because he never knows what 
he will get. In Dick’s first 
novel. Solar Lottery, which 
Ace has just reissued, he gave 
us a complicated and quite 
unsatisfying picture puzzle of 
an Earth governed by some 

98 



sort of quiz-show device for 
selecting a ruler. It was per- 
haps even more complex than 
van Vogt. His newest book is 
Time Out of Joint (Lippin- 
cott) — “oh, cursed spite,’’ 

says Hamlet, finishing the 
quotation, “that ever I was 
born to set it right.” But 
Dick’s hero does not set it 
right. He gets less use out of 
more power than any science 
fiction hero of recent years. 
This is a most uneven book. 
There is a masterful opening 
in which Dick supplies the 
reader, with skill and econo- 
my, just the right hints as to 
what the surprises will be. 
Then there is some adroit 
weaving of the threads, and 
then . The book doesn’t ex- 
actly end. It disintegrates. 
Lippincott, for reasons best 
known to Lippincott, has 
chosen to hide the fact that 
this is science fiction by 
labeling it “A Novel of Men- 
ace.” Well, so is Moby Dick. 
But Time Out of Joint is sci- 
ence fiction, all right, and fine 
of its kind in the first hun- 
dred-odd pages. 

Donald A. Wollheim has 
put together two more Ace 
anthologies. In The Hidden 
Planet, the motif is the planet 
Venus, and Oliver, McIntosh, 
del Rey, Weinbaum and 
Brackett give us their several 
views of what’s happening 
under all those clouds. After 
a quarter of a century Wein- 
baum’s The Lotus Eaters is 
still the best story in the 




book, but there aren’t any bad 
ones. Wollheim’s second an- 
thology, The Macabre Reader, 
is horror-fantasy and, as 
Wollheim is a traditionalist, 
naturally includes Lovecraft, 
Smith, Wandrei and Howard. 
But it also has a fine scary 
Robert Bloch and a worri- 
some piece by that masterly 
Old Hand ( presently manipu- 
lating real estate and contem- 
lating the cobwebs on his 
typewriter) , Thorp McClusky 
. There is also a novel by 
John C. Cooper, The Haunted 
Strangler (Ace), which is to 
become a movie starring 
Boris Karloff. Karloff can 
perhaps make credible this 
flight of idiocy involving a 
Mad London Doctor, but the 
printed page cannot. 

Friends of the family may 
like to know of a new anthol- 
ogy, The Fourth Galaxy Read- 
er (Doubleday), and a new 
short story collection. Tomor- 
row Times Seven (Ballan- 
tine). As the anthology is 
edited by our editor, and the 
short stories are written by 
the undersigned, this column 
is forbidden to praise and un- 
willing to blame. 

F our scientific classics are 
back in print. Mentor has 
just reissued Bertrand Rus- 
sell’s The ABC of Relativity, 
probably the first layman’s 
guide to space-time, and 
(with scrupulous editing and 
revising by Felix Pirani) 
probably still the best. D. E. 



Smith’s History of Mathe- 
matics (Dover) is in two fat, 
full volumes, the first a series 
of biographical sketches of 
some 1200 mathematicians, 
the second an orderly narra- 
tive of the growth of mathe- 
matical thought. It omits 
nothing. Another Smith, 
Homer W., gives us again his 
famous Man and His Gods 
(Grosset), which shows us 
the origins of all human re- 
ligions. Finally there is Wolf- 
gang Kohler’s The Mentality 
of Apes (Vintage). Science 
fiction readers have come 
across these experiments on 
chimpanzee minds in many 
stories. (In de Camp and 
Miller’s Genus Homo, for ex- 
ample, the apes are testing 
the men!) Here is the orig- 
inal text, aft6r forty years 
still fresh and fascinating. 

In Soviet Space Science 
(Basic Books), Ari Shtern- 
feld does not tell us any 
guarded secrets of the Rus- 
sian rocket effort. Indeed, the 
book’s only fault is the word 
“soviet” in the title, for it is 
nationless, worldwide science 
which is discussed here. 
Among its attractive features 
are a foreword and an epi- 
logue by Willy Ley, who 
brings Shtemfeld up to date 
and comments on the book it- 
self. 

T O WRITE Brighter Than 
a Thousand Suns (Har- 
court. Brace), Robert Jungk 
interviewed nearly every nu- 



99 




clear physicist of any conse- 
quence. The result is as 
vivid as Pearl S. Buck’s fic- 
tional treatment of the theme 
is flat. Jungk lets us under- 
stand Einstein’s fears, sympa- 
thize with Oppenheimer’s 
conflicts. Yet this book makes 
one claim so incredible that 
the whole work must be held 
to question. Jungk tells us, 
with no visible skepticism, 
that Hitler had no atomic 
weapon to destroy us with be- 
cause Nazi scientists had too 
many moral scruples to make 
one. Think of the “experi- 
mental medicine” of the con- 
centration camps, the system- 
atic annihilation of Jews, 
Poles and Gypsies. It would 
seem to need more than a self- 
serving declaration from the 
parties involved to make such 
a thesis convincing. 

AN ABSOLUTE model of a 
technical book for the lay 
reader is Hans Thirring’s 
Energy for Man (Indiana 
University Press). Dr. Thir- 
ring assumes that his reader 
can understand English and 
can concentrate, and assumes 
nothing else. Although the 
book makes use of much 
shorthand notation and a cer- 
tain minimum employment of 
math, everything is explained 
and defined — once. It is nec- 
essary to keep your mind on 
it, but it is not necessary to 
be trained up to reading it. 
Dr. Thirring does that chore 
for you as you go along. 

100 



What he also does is to ex- 
plain his predictions by 
means of that useful old in- 
vention of logic, the reductio 
ad ahsurdum. Future events 
will take just this sort of 
shape, says Dr. Thirring, be- 
cause, look, if they don’t, then 
we find ourselves in this fool- 
ish contradiction. This is a 
solid, thoughtful, interesting 
job; and if there is any essen- 
tial fact bearing on Man’s 
prospects of future power 
generation that isn’t here, 
you’ll never miss it. 

Norman Lansdell’s The 
Atom and the Energy Revo- 
lution (Philosophical Li- 
brary), which covers some- 
what similar ground, cannot 
help but suffer by comparison 
with Thirring. Few books 
could. Yet on its own terms 
Lansdell’s book has much to 
tell us. As an Englishman, 
Lansdell is principally inter- 
ested in the work now going 
on in the United Kingdom; 
and for a glimpse of what’s 
happening at Calder Hall and 
Harwell — ^which is to say 
what’s happening anywhere 
in the free world on fusion 
power — his book is very valu- 
able. 

J EAN ROSTAND’S new 
book asks us in its title 
Can Man Be Modified? (Basic 
Books), and he gives us an 
answer of sorts in the less 
than 100 pages of text that 
make up this slim, odd vol- 
ume. Dr. Rostand is an ex- 




perimental biologist of great 
fame (as well as being the 
son of the man who wrote 
Cyrano de Bergerac) ^ and we 
might hope for some stimu- 
lating and original informa- 
tion in this book. Unfortu- 
nately we would not be entire- 
ly gratified. For what is here 
is more a discussion of the 
philosophical implications of 
self-remaking than a glimpse 
of what that task might ulti- 
mately lead to. 

In The Earth Beneath the 
Sea (Johns Hopkins), Fran- 
cis P. Sheppard tells us a 
great deal we never learned 
in school (if only because 
even the experts didn't know 
much of it until the past dec- 
ade) about the three-quarters 
of the Earth's surface that 
lies under water. The book is 
often technical but never in- 
comprehensible; and the au- 
thor does not neglect such 
non-technical entries as his 
own eyewitness account of the 
great Hawaiian tsunami of 
1947, or full directions for 
skindiving on a coral reef. 

Douglas Botting's Island of 
the Dragon's Blood (Wilfred 
Funk) is exploration and ad- 
venture on the island of Soco- 
tra, where Indian Ocean and 
Gulf of Aden meet. It is a hot, 
dirty, pestilential place, and 
the very accuracy of Mr. 
Botting's reporting makes it 
appear unpleasant and dull. 

C. G. Jung ranks next to 



Adler and just under Freud 
in the pantheon of modern 
psychiatry. In World in 
Crisis (Mentor), Jung leaves 
the world within the mind to 
examine the problems of the 
world that our minds seem 
about to destroy ... In The 
Calendar for the Modern 
Age (Thomas Nelson), Elisa- 
beth Achelis argues for ‘The 
World Calendar." The new 
system would make all quar- 
ters equal and insure that 
one’s birthday would fall on 
the same day of the week each 
year; but it offers few other 
improvements. And the evi- 
dence IMiss Achelis summons 
up is sometimes queerly mys- 
tical and sometimes {e,g., “In 
color we are told there are the 
primary colors — red, blue, yel- 
low and also white") quite 
wrong. 

T hose who have a morbid 
interest in witchcraft and 
diabolism will like A Pictorial 
Anthology of Witchcraft, 
Magic and Alchemy (Univer- 
sity Books), by Emile Grillot 
De Givry. This volume in- 
cludes 400 quite horrible 
illustrations and many useful 
spells. To make a girl love 
you, for example, you need 
only touch her hand and mut- 
ter: “Bestarberto corrumpit 
viscera ejus mulieris." 

If you try it, let us know 
what happened.

COUNTERWEIGHT 



Every toivn has crime — but 



especially a town that is 



traveling from star to starl 



S URE Vm a NUly, and Eve 
died seven times, always 
in the blackness of the outer 
reaches, and Vm not alone, al- 
though there aren't very 
many of us, never were. 

It made sense. Interstellar 
was new and they wanted him 
on the ship because he was a 
trained observer. They want- 
ed facts, not gibberish. But to 
ask a man to give up two 
years of his life — well, that 



was asking a lot. Two years 
in a sardine can. Still, it had 
an appeal Keith Ellason knew 
he couldn’t deny, a newsman’s 
joy of the clean beat, a plan- 
etary system far afield, a 
closeup view of the universe, 
history in the making. 

Interstellar Chief Rexroad 
knocked the dottle from his 
pipe in a tray, sajdng, 
“Transworld Press is willing 
to let you have a leave of ab- 



102 




scence, if you're interested.” 

He knew Secretary Phipps 
from years of contacting, and 
now Phipps said, ‘Tersonally, 
I don't want to see anybody 
else on the job. You've got a 
fine record in this sort of 
thing.'' 

Keith Ellason smiled, but 
just barely. ‘'You should 
have called me for the first 
trip.'' 

Phipps nodded. “I wish we 
had had you on the Weblo7^ 
/.'' 

“Crewmen,” Rexroad said, 
“make poor reporters.” 

The Weblor I had taken off 
on the first trip to Antheon 
five years before with a 
thousand families, reached 
the planet with less than five 
hundred surviving colonists. 
Upon the return to Earth a 
year later, the crew's report 
of suffering and chaos during 
the year's outgoing voyage 
was twisted, distorted and 
fragmentary. Ellason remem- 
bered it well. The decision of 
Interstellar was that the 
colonists started a revolution 
far out in space, that it was 
fanned by the ignorance of 
Captain Sessions in dealing 
with such matters. 

“Space affects men in a pe- 
culiar way,” Phipps said. “We 
have conquered the problem 
of small groups in space — 
witness the discovery of An- 
theon, for example — but when 
there are large groups, con- 
trol is more difficult.” 

“Sessions,” Rexroad said, 

COUNTERWEIGHT 



“was a bully. The trouble 
started at about the halfway 
point. It ended with passen- 
gers engaging in open war- 
fare with each other and the 
crew. Sessions was lucky to 
escape with his life.” 

“As I recall,” Ellason said, 
“there was something about 
stunners.” 

Phipps rubbed his chin. 
“No weapons were allowed on 
the ship, but you must re- 
member the colonists were se- 
lected for their intelligence 
and resourcefulness. They 
utilized these attributes to set 
up weapon shops to arm 
themselves.” 

“The second trip is his- 
tory,” Rexroad said. “And a 
puzzle.” 

LLASON nodded. “The 
ship disappeared.” 

“Yes. We gave control to 
the colonists.” 

“Assuming no accident in 
space,” Phipps said, “it was 
a wrong decision. They prob- 
ably took over the ship.” 
“And now,” Ellason said, 
“you're going to try again.” 
Rexroad said very gravely, 
“We've got the finest captain 
in Interplanetary. Harvey 
Branson. No doubt you've 
heard of him. He's spent his 
life in our own system, and 
he's handpicking his own 
crew. We have also raised 
prerequisites for applicants. 
We don't think anything is 
going to happen, but if it 
does, we want to get an im- 

103 





personal, unprejudiced view. 
That's where you come in. 
You do the observing, the re- 
porting. We'll evaluate it on 
your return." 

'Tf I return," said Ellason. 

‘T suppose that's problem- 
atical," Phipps said, ''but I 
think you will. Captain Bran- 
son and his fifty crewmen 
want to return as badly as 
you do." He grinned. "You 
can write that novel you're al- 
ways talking about on your 
return trip on the Wehlor //." 

Being a Nilly is important, 
probably as important as run- 
ning the ship, and I think it 
is this thought that keeps us 
satisfied, ivilling to be what 
IV e are. 

T he Weblor II had been 
built in space, as had its 
predecessor, the Weblor /, at 
a tremendous cost. Basically, 
it was an instrument which 
would open distant vistas to 
colonization, reducing the 
shoulder-to-shoulder pressure 
of a crowded solar system. A 
gigantic, hollow spike, the 
ship would never land any- 
where, but would circle An- 
theon as it circled Earth, 
shuttling its cargo and pas- 
sengers to the promised land, 
the new frontier. A space- 
borne metropolis, it would be 
the home for three thousand 
persons outward bound, only 
the crew on the return trip. 
It was equipped with every 
conceivable facility and com- 
fort — dining rooms, assembly 

104 



hall, individual and fam- 
ily compartments, recreation 
areas, swimming pool, library, 
theater. Nothing had been 
overlooked. 

The captain's briefing room 
was crowded, the air was 
heavy with the breathing of 
so many men, and the ventila- 
tors could not quite clear the 
air of tobacco smoke that 
drifted aimlessly here and 
there before it was caught 
and whisked away. 

In the tradition of news- 
paperman and observer, Keith 
Ellason tried to be as incon- 
spicuous as possible, pressing 
against a bulkhead, but Cap- 
tain Branson's eyes sought 
his several times as Branson 
listened to final reports from 
his engineers, record keepers, 
fuel men, computermen, and 
all the rest. He grunted 
his approval or disapproval, 
made a suggestion here, a re- 
striction there. There was no 
doubt that Branson was in 
charge, yet there was a hu- 
man quality about him that 
Ellason liked. The captain's 
was a lean face, well tanned, 
and his eyes were chunks of 
blue. 

"Gentlemen," Branson said 
at last, as Ellason knew he 
would, "I want to introduce 
Keith Ellason, whose pres- 
ence Interstellar has impress- 
ed upon us. On loan from 
Transworld, he will have an 
observer status." He intro- 
duced him to the others. All 
of them seemed friendly; 



JERRY SOHL 




Ellason thought it was a good 
staff. 

Branson detained him after 
the others had gone. “One 
thing, Mr. Ellason. To make 
it easier for you, I suggest 
you think of this journey 
strictly from the observer 
viewpoint. There will be no 
story for Transworld at the 
end.” 

Ellason was startled. While 
he had considered the possi- 
bility, he had not dwelt on it. 
Now it loomed large in his 
mind. “I don’t understand. 
Captain Branson. It seems to 
me — ” 

“Let me put it differently. 
Let me say that you will not 
understand why I say that un- 
til the journey ends.” He 
smiled. “Perhaps I shouldn’t 
have mentioned it.” 

E llason left the captain’s 
quarters with an odd taste 
in his mouth. Now why had 
Branson said that? Why 
hadn’t Rexroad or Phipps said 
something, if it was impor- 
tant? 

He made himself comfort- 
able in his seven-foot-by-sev- 
en-foot cubicle, which is to 
say he dropped on his bed, 
found it more comfortable 
than he thought it would be, 
put his arms behind his head, 
stared at the ceiling. Metal 
walls, no windows, one floor 
vent, one ceiling vent, and a 
solitary ceiling molding tube- 
light. This would be his home 
for a year, just as there were 

COUNTERWEIGHT 



homes like it for three thous- 
and others, except that the 
family rooms would be larg- 
er. His quarters were near the 
front of the spike near the 
officers’ quarters. 

He felt rather than heard 
the dull rumble. It was a 
sound he knew would be with 
him for two years — one year 
going and one year returning. 

He looked at his watch, 
picked up his notebook and 
made an entry. The ship right 
now would be slipping ever 
so slowly away from Earth. 
He got up. He’d have to go 
forward to the observation 
dome to see that. Last view 
of Earth for two years. 

The penetration of space 
by large groups is the coming 
out from under the traditions 
of thousands of years, and as 
these planet-orginated rules 
fall away, the floundering 
group seeks a new control, 
for they are humanity adrift, 
rudderless, for whom the 
stars are no longer bearings 
but nonexistent things, and 
values are altered if they are 
not shotvn the way. 

The theft of Carver Jans- 
sen’s attache case occurred on 
the thirty-first day out. In 
Ellason’s mind the incident, 
though insignificant from the 
standpoint of the ship as a 
whole, could very well be the 
cause of dissension later on. 
His notes covering it were 
therefore very thorough. 

Janssen’s case contained 
vegetable and flower seeds — 

105 




thousands of them, according 
to the Captain’s Bulletin, the 
ship’s daily newsletter which 
went to all hands and passen- 
gers. In the Bulletin the cap- 
tain appealed to the thief to 
return the case to Mr. Jans- 
sen. He said it was significant 
that all en route had passed 
stability tests, and that it was 
to the ship’s discredit that 
someone with criminal ten- 
dencies should have been pex- 
mitted aboard. 

Ellason had to smile at that. 
What did Captain Branson 
think of those colonists who 
killed each other on the Web- 
lor I? They had passed sta- 
bility tests too. This, then, 
was what happened when you 
took three thousand strangers 
and stuck them in a can for a 
year. 

W HEN Ellason saw Bran- 
son about it, the captain 
said, “Of course I realize it 
takes only a little thing like 
this to set things off. I know 
people get tired of seeing each 
other, playing the same tapes, 
looking at the stars from the 
observation dome, walking 
down the same corridors, 
reading the same books, eat- 
ing the same meals, though 
God knows we try to vary it 
as much as we can. Space 
creates rough edges. But the 
point is, we know all this, and 
knowing it, we shouldn’t let 
it happen. We’ve got to find 
that thief.” 

“What would he want seeds 



for? Have you thought of 
that?” 

“Of course. They’d have 
real value on Antheon.” 
Ellason sought out Carver 
Janssen. He was a middle- 
aged man with a tired face 
and sad eyes. He said, “Now 
what am I going to Antheon 
for? I could only take along 
so much baggage and I threw 
out some comfort items to 
make room for the seeds. I’m 
a horticulturist, and Inter- 
stellar asked me to go along. 
But what use am I now? 
Where am I going to get 
seeds like those ? Do you know 
how long it took me to collect 
them? They’re not ordinary 
seeds, Mr. Ellason.” 

There was an appeal from 
Janssen in the next day’s 
newsletter describing the 
seeds, telling of their value, 
and requesting their return 
in the interests of the An- 
theon colony and of humanity. 

On the thirty-fourth day a 
witness turned up who said 
he had seen a man emerging 
from Janssen’s compartment 
with the black case. “I didn’t 
think anything of it at the 
time,” Jamieson Dievers said. 

Branson asked him to de- 
scribe the man. 

“Oh, he was about six feet 
tall, stocky build, and he wore 
a red rubber mask that cov- 
ered his head completely.” 
“Didn’t you think that was 
important?” Branson asked 
in an outraged voice. “A man 
wearing a red mask?”

Dievers shrugged. “This is 
a spaceship. How would I 
know whether a red mask — 
or a blue or green one — does 
or doesn’t belong on a space- 
ship?” 

Although Dievers’ account 
appeared in the newsletter, it 
was largely discounted. 

“If it is true,” Branson told 
Ellason, “the theft must be 
the work of a psychotic. But 
I don’t believe Jamieson Diev- 
ers. It may well be he’s the 
psychotic.” He snorted. “Red 
rubber mask ! I think I’ll have 
Dievers put through psychia- 
try.” 

Attendant to taking notes 
on this incident, Ellason 
noted a strange thing. Jans- 
sen lived in that part of the 
ship known as the First 
Quadrant, and those who lived 
in that quadrant — more than 
seven hundred men, women 
and children — felt that the 
thief must surely live in 
Quadrant Two or Four. Elias 
Cromley, Avho had the com- 
partment next to Janssen’s, 
sounded the consensus when 
he said, “Surely a man would- 
n’t steal from his own quad- 
rant, now would he, Mr. 
Ellason?” 

And so, Ellason observed in 
his notebook, are wars creat- 
ed. 

Seen in space, stars are un- 
moving, silent, sterile bright 
eyes ever watch ful and accus- 
ing. To men unused to it, 
sueh a sight numbs, eom- 
jmesscs, stultifies. He intro- 

COUNTERWEIGHT 



duces a countermeasure, proof 
he exists, which is any overt 
act, sometimes violent. 

O N THE forty-fifth day 
June Failright, the young 
wife of one of the passenger 
meteorologists, ran screaming 
down one of the long corri- 
dors of the Third Quadrant. 
She told the captain she had 
been attacked in her compart- 
ment while her husband was 
in the ship’s library. She was 
taken to one of the ship’s doc- 
tors, who confirmed it. 

She said the culprit was a 
husky man wearing a red 
rubber mask, and though her 
description of what he had 
done did not appear in the 
story in the newsletter, it lost 
no time in penetrating every 
compartment of the ship. 

Ellason was present when 
a delegation from the Third 
Quadrant called on Captain 
Branson, demanding action. 

Branson remained seated 
behind his desk, unperturbed, 
saying, “I have no crewmen 
to spare for police duty.” 

The delegation commenced 
speaking vehemently, to be 
quieted by Branson’s raised 
hand. 

“I sympathize,” Branson 
said, “but it is up to each 
quadrant to deal with its 
problems, whatever they may 
be. My job is to get us to An- 
theon.” 

The group left in a surly 
mood. 

“You wonder at my reluc- 

107 




tance, Mr, Ellason,” Captain 
Branson said. “But suppose I 
assign the crew to patrol 
duties, the culprit isn’t 
caught, and further incidents 
occur. What then ? It soon be- 
comes the crew’s fault. And 
soon the colonists will begin 
thinking these things might 
be the crew’s doing in the 

“Yes,” Ellason said, “but 
what if the intruder is a 
crewman?” 

“I know my men,” Branson 
said flatly. 

“You could have a shake- 
down for the mask and the 
seed case.” 

“Do you think it is a mem- 
ber of the crew?” Branson’s 
eyes were bright. “No, I trust 
my men, I won’t violate that 
trust.” 

Ellason left, feeling un- 
easy. If he were Branson, 
he’d initiate an investigation, 
if nothing else than to prove 
the crew guiltless. Why 
couldn’t Branson see the wis- 
dom of setting an example for 
the colonists? 

As a Nilly, I kneiv that 
space breeds hate. There is a 
seed of malevolence in every 
man. It sometimes blossoms 
out among the stars. On the 
Weblor II it xvas ready for 
ripening. 

Raymond Palugger was 
killed in the ship’s hospital on 
the sixty-first day. Palugger, 
a Fourth Quadrant passenger, 
had complained of feeling ill, 
had been hospitalized with a 

108 



diagnosis of ileus. He had put 
his money belt in the drawer 
of the small stand beside his 
bed. A man in a red mask was 
seen hurrying from the hos- 
pital area, and a staff investi- 
gation revealed that Palugger 
had died trying to prevent the 
theft of the belt. 

Captain Branson did not 
wait for the newsletter. 
Through the ship’s speaker 
system, he reported that Pa- 
lugger had a fortune in cred- 
its in the belt and had died of 
a severe beating. He said that 
since the incident occurred in 
the staff section of the ship, 
his crew would be forced to 
submit to a thorough inspec- 
tion in an effort to find the 
mask, the seed case, the 
money and the man. 

“I will not countenance 
such an act by a crewman,” 
Branson said. “If and when 
he is found, he will be severe- 
ly dealt with. But he might 
not be a member of the crew. 
I am ordering an assembly of 
all passengers at nine tomor- 
row morning in the auditor- 
ium. I will speak to you all 
then.” 

F aces were angry, tongues 
were sharp at the meet- 
ing, eyes suspicious and tem- 
pers short. Above it all was 
the overpowering presence of 
Captain Branson speaking to 
them. 

“It is not my desire to in- 
terfere in passenger affairs,” 
he said. “Insofar as the ship 



JERRY SOHL 




is concerned, it is my duty to 
make certain no crewman is 
guilty. This I am doing. But 
my crew is not and cannot be 
a police force for you. It is up 
to you people to police and 
protect yourselves.'' 

‘‘How can we protect our- 
selves without stunners?" one 
colonist called out. 

“Has Red Mask a gun?" 
Branson retorted. “It seems 
to me you have a better weap- 
on than any gun." 

“What's that?" 

“This ship is only so wide, 
so long and so deep. If every 
inch is searched, you'll find 
your man. He has to be some- 
where aboard." 

The colonists quieted. Ben- 
jamin Simpson, one of the 
older men, was elected presi- 
dent of the newly formed 
Quadrant Council. One man 
from each of the quadrants 
was named to serve under 
him. Each of these men in 
turn selected five others from 
his own group. 

Those assembled waited in 
the hall while each team of 
six inspected the compart- 
ments of the others. These 
compartments were then lock- 
ed, everyone returned to his 
compartment, and the larger 
search was conducted. It took 
twenty hours. 

No mask was found. No 
mask, no case, no money, no 
man. 

The captain reported that 
his search had been equally 
fruitless. At another assem- 



bly the following day it was 
decided to make the inspec- 
tion teams permanent, to 
await further moves on the 
part of Red Mask. The Quad- 
rant Council held periodic 
meetings to set up a method 
of trial for him when he was 
caught. It was all recorded in 
the newsletter and by Keith 
Ellason. 

We Nillys knoiv about hate 
and about violence. We know 
too that ivhere there is hate 
there is violence y and where 
there is violence there is 
death. 

D uring sleep time on the 
seventy-ninth day Bar- 
bara Stoneman, awakened by 
a strange sound, sat up in the 
bed of her compartment to 
find a man in a red mask in 
her room. Her cries brought 
neighbors into the corridor. 
The flight of the man was 
witnessed by many, and sev- 
eral men tried to stop him. 
But the intruder was light on 
his feet and fast. He escaped. 

The Quadrant Council con- 
fronted the captain, demand- 
ing weapons. 

“Are you out of your 
minds?" Branson exclaimed, 
Tom Tilbury, Fourth Quad- 
rant leader, said, “We want 
to set up a police force. Cap- 
tain. We want stunners." 

“There's no law against 
it," Branson said, “but it's a 
rule of mine that no weapons 
are to be issued en route." 
“If we had had a gun, we'd 

109 



COUNTERWEIGHT 




have got Red Mask/' Tilbury 
said. 

“And I might have a mur- 
der on my conscience." 

Tilbury said, “We've also 
thought of that. Suppose you 
supply us with half-power 
stunners? That way we can 
stun but not kill." 

They got their guns. Now 
there were twenty-four po- 
licemen on duty in the corri- 
dors — eight on at a time. 
Ellason observed that for the 
first time the passengers 
seemed relaxed. 

Let Red Mask move against 
armed men, they said. 

Yeah, let him see what 
happens now. 

Red Mask did. 

O N THE 101st day he was 
seen in a corridor in 
Quadrant Four. Emil Pierce, 
policeman on duty, managed 
to squeeze off several shots at 
his retreating figure. 

Red Mask was seen again 
on the 120th day, on the 135th 
day, and the 157th day. He 
was seen, shot at, but not hit. 
He was also unable to com- 
mit any crime. 

We've got him on the run, 
the colonists said. 

He's afraid to do anything, 
now that we've got police pro- 
tection, they said smugly. 

The Quadrant Council con- 
gratulated itself. The pas- 
sengers were proud of 
themselves. A special congrat- 
ulatory message from Cap- 
tain Branson appeared one 

110 



day in the Bulletin newslet- 
ter. 

The colonists settled down 
to living out the rest of the 
voyage until the landing on 
Antheon. 

But on the 170th day 
calamity sti’uck. Red Mask 
appropriated one of the stun- 
ners, made his way down one 
whole corridor section in 
Quadrant Two, put occupants 
to sleep as he went, taking 
many articles of value and 
leaving disorder behind. 

Ellason interviewed as 
many victims as he could, 
noted it all in his book. The 
things taken were keepsakes, 
photographs and items of 
personal value. It seemed to 
be the work of a madman. If 
Red Mask wanted to make 
everyone furious, he certain- 
ly succeeded. 

“What does he want that 
stuff for?" Casey Stromberg, 
a passenger doctor, asked. “I 
can see him taking my nar- 
cotics, my doctor's kit — but 
my dead wife's picture? That 
I don’t understand." 

It was the same with oth- 
ers. “The man's insane, Mr. 
Ellason. Positively insane." 
Many people said it. 

The council issued orders 
that all passengers from now 
on would be required to lock 
their compartments at all 
times. More guns were ob- 
tained from the captain. More 
policemen were appointed. 

Ellason was busy noting it 
all in his book. It became fill- 

JERRY SOHL 




ed with jottings about inno- 
cent people being accidentally 
stunned when trigger-happy 
policemen thought their move- 
ments suspicious, about one 
man’s suspicion of another 
and the ensuing search of 
compartments, people who 
saw Red Mask here, saw him 
there. Hardly a day went by 
without some new develop- 
ment, 

“Oh, yes, Mr. Ellason, we’re 
going to get him,” said Til- 
bury, now chief of police, 
cracking his knuckles, his 
eyes glowing at the thought. 
“We’re bound to get him. 
We’ve got things worked out 
to the finest detail. He won’t 
be able to get through our 
lingers now. Just let him 
make so much as a move.” 
“And what will you do 
when you get him?” 

“Kill him,” Tilbury said, 
licking his lips, his eyes glow- 
ing more fiercely than ever. 
“Without a trial?” 

“Oh, there’ll be a trial, Mr, 
Ellason, but you don’t think 
any jury’d let him live after 
all the things he’s done, do 
you?” 

R ed mask was stunned in 
Quadrant Four in a cor- 
ridor by a policeman named 
Terryl Placer on the 201st 
day. The criminal was car- 
ried to the assembly room 
surrounded by guards, for he 
surely would have been maul- 
ed, if not killed, by angry 
colonists who crowded around. 

COUNTERWEIGHT 



In the assembly hall his mask 
was whipped off. The crowd 
gasped. Nobody knew him. 

Ellason’s first thought was 
that he must be a stowaway, 
but then he remembered the 
face, and Captain Branson, 
who came to have a look at 
him, unhappily admitted the 
man was a member of the 
crew. His name was Harrel 
Critten and he was a record 
keeper third class. 

“Well, Critten,” Branson 
roared at him, “what have 
you got to say for yourself?” 

“Go to hell,” Critten said 
quietly. As if it were an after- 
thought, he spat at the cap- 
tain. 

Branson looked as if he 
were going to kill the man 
himself right there and then. 

It was a long trial — from 
the 220th to the 241st day — 
and there didn't seem to be 
much doubt about the out- 
come, for Critten didn’t help 
his own cause during any of 
it. 

Lemuel Tarper, who was 
appointed prosecutor, asked 
him, “What did you do with 
the loot, Critten?” 

Critten looked him square 
in the eye and said, “I threw 
it out one of the escape 
chutes. Does that answer 
your question?” 

“Threw it away?” Tarper 
and the crowd were incredu- 
lous. 

“Sure,” Critten said. “You 
colonists got the easy life 
as passengers, just sitting 

111 




around. 1 had to work my 
head off keeping records for 
you lazy bastards.'’ 

The verdict was, of course, 
death. 

They executed Harrel Crit- 
ten on the morning of the 
270th day with blasts from six 
stunners supplied with full 
power. It was witnessed by a 
great crowd in the assembly 
hall. A detail from the ship’s 
crew disposed of his body 
through a chute. 

It was all duly recorded in 
Keith Ellason’s notebooks. 

Dying is easy for a Nilly. 
Especially if tVs arranged for 
beforehand, ivhich it ahvays 
is. 

T he Weblor II was only one 
day out of orbit v^hen 
Captain Branson sent for 
Ellason and introduced him 
to the executed man. 

'‘Hello,” Critten said, grin- 
ning from ear to ear. 

“I figured as much,” Ella- 
son said. “I’ve been doing a 
lot of thinking.” 

“You’re perhaps a little too 
good as an observer,” Bran- 
son said. “Or maybe it was 
because you really weren’t 
one of the colonists. But no 
matter, Critten did a good 
job. He was trained by an old 
friend of mine for this job, 
Gelthorpe Nill. Nill used to be 
in counter-espionage when 
there were wars.” 

“You were excellent,” Ella- 
son said. 

“Can’t say I enjoyed the' 

112 



role,” said Critten, “but I 
think it saved lives.” 

“Let me get this straight. 
Interstellar thought that it 
was idleness and boredom 
that caused the killings on the 
Weblor /, so they had you 
trained to be a scapegoat. Is 
that right?” 

Critten nodded. “When 
great numbers are being 
transported, they are apt to 
magnify each little event be- 
cause so little happens. It was 
my job to see that they direct- 
ed none of their venom 
against each other or the 
crew, only toward me.” 
Branson smiled. “It made 
the time pass quickly and in- 
terestingly for the passen- 
gers.” 

“To say nothing of me,” 
Critten said. 

“And you, Mr. Ellason, 
were along to observe it all,” 
Captain Branson put in. “In- 
terstellar wanted an accurate 
picture of this. If it worked, 
they told me they’d use it on 
other ti’ips to Antheon.” 
Ellason nodded. “No time 
for brooding, for differences 
of opinion on small matters. 
Just time to hate Mr. Critten. 
Unanimously.” 

“Probal)Iy,” Critten said, 
“you are wondering about the 
execution.” 

“Naturally.” 

“We removed the charges 
before the guns were used.” 
“And Carver Janssen's 
case?” 

“He’ll get it back vrhen he’s 

JERRY SOHL 




shuttled to Antheon. And all 
the other items will be re- 
turned. They’re all tagged 
with their owner’s names. 
Captain Branson will say they 
were found somewhere on the 
ship. You see, I was a liar.” 
“How about that assault on 
June Failright?” 

Critten grinned again. “She 
played right into our hands. 
She ran out into the hall 
claiming I’d attacked her, 
which I did not. She was cer- 
tainly amazed when the ship’s 
physicians agreed with her. 
Of course Captain Branson 
told them to do that.” 

“And the murder?” 
“Raymond Palugger died 
in the hospital all right, but 
he died from his illness on the 
operating table. We turned it 
into an advantage by making 
it look suspicious.” 

Ellason brightened. “And 
by that time everybody was 
seeing Red Mask everywhere 
and the colonists organized 
against him.” 

“Gave them something to 
do,” Branson said. 

“Every time things got 
dull, I livened them up. I got 



a stunner and robbed along 
the corridor. That really stir- 
red them. Lucky nobody got 
hurt during any of it, includ- 
ing that Stoneman woman. I 
was trying to rob her when 
she woke up.” 

B ranson cleared his 

throat. “Ah, Ellason about 
that story. You understand 
you can’t write it, don’t you ?” 
Ellason said regretfully 
that he did understand. 

“The colonists will never 
know the truth,” Branson 
went on. “There will be other 
ships outward bound.” 

Critten sighed. “And I’ll 
have to be caught again.” 
Yes, we’re anonymous, 
nameless, we Nillys, for that’s 
what we call each other, and 
are a theme, with variations, 
in the endless stretches of 
deep space, objects of hatred 
and contempt, professional 
heels, dying once a trip when 
the time is ripe, antidote to 
boredom, and we’ll ply our 
trade, our little tragedies, on 
a thousand ships bringing hu- 
manity to neiv worlds.

“EL” — electroluminescence — is the next stage beyond incandescent and 
fluorescent light; made up of phosphor-plastic “sandwiches,” EL allows 
extremely uniform and flexible lighting, promising walls of light, drapes 
of light, picture-frame TV, and safer X-raying. Already on the market 
is an EL night light — a two-inch square panel that will burn a year 
for less than a penny’s electricity — and breakthroughs are expected to 
develop brighter phosphors, says Industrial Research.

T he man wore gray pants, 
gray socks, gray shoes. 
His blouse was gray, his hair, 
his eyes, the color of his skin. 
I didn^t have to ask his name. 



He looked at me and his 
eyes widened. ‘‘Ruby?'' 

I nodded, ignoring the ex- 
pression. It was one I had 
seen too often. One day, per- 



114 



Sweet choice they gave me — to make a living on 
Dispar, I had to be someone’s murder proxy! 




haps, I might get used to it. 
One day. 

He ordered rye on rocks, 
double rye and not too many 
ice cubes. The liquor stung my 



throat as it went down. It was 
good rye. It had traveled well 
across space. 

Gray said, “Someone wants 
to kill me.” 



115 




“So?” I asked. 

“So now you know why I 
sent for you.” He picked up 
his glass, the ice rattling as 
he lifted it to his mouth. “I 
don’t want to die.” 

“Who does?” The drink was 
free. I finished it and waited 
for him to say something. 

“It’s a business matter, I 
think,” he said. “You know 
how it is. I’ve done pretty 
well out here and anyone who 
does that makes enemies. Now 
one of them wants to kill 
me.” 

“Do you know who?” 
“Someone called Orange.” 
He shrugged at that. “I re- 
ceived notification of intent 
this morning, effective as 
from dawn tomorrow. The 
usual thing: either I leave 
Dispar or I get killed.” He 
tried to smile and didn’t 
quite make it. “A simple 
choice.” 

“Then why not take it?” 
“Run away?” He looked 
past me, his imagination 
penetrating the walls and 
reaching to the lush, fertile 
lands at the foot of the Rag- 
ing Hills. Meltin grew in 
those lands and meltin fetch- 
ed a hundred solars an ounce, 
port of entry, Earth. It is 
never easy to run away from 
a fortune. Gray, apparently, 
was finding it impossible. 

The empty glass in my 
hand was a nuisance. I set it 
down. The bartender waited 
for Gray’s nod before he re- 
filled it. 



“So you don’t want t6 
run,” I said. “What do you 
want?” 

“I want you to act as 
proxy.” He didn’t look at me 
as he said it. “If you agree, 
you can file notification and 
take care of things for me.” 
He hesitated. “I’ll pay you 
well.” 

“How well?” 

T he hesitation grew. Money 
and Gray were obviously 
closer than husband and wife. 
I waited. It is always an edu- 
cation to find out just how 
much a man values his exist- 
ance. 

“Five thousand solars — 
payable when my enemy has 
been eliminated.” 

I swallowed my drink and 
headed toward the door. He 
caught my arm as I passed. 
“Ruby! For God’s sake!” 
“What?” 

“How much do you want?” 
“Ten thousand solars now. 
Ten more when the job is fin- 
ished.” 

“That’s robbery!” 

I jerked my arm away from 
his hand. “It’s your skin.” 
He bit his lip, thinking of 
all the money his life was go- 
ing to cost him. Money he 
could earn in a few weeks’ 
hard work at his concession. 
His eyes drifted over my face. 

“Acid ! My client nearly lost 
out that time. Well?” 

His fingers trembled as 
they counted out the money. 
They were moist when they 

E. C. TUBB 



116 




clutched my hand. “Ruby! 
You'll make sure?" 

The money went into my 
pocket. 

'T'll do my best." 

“Of course you will." He 
seemed to want convincing. 
“Look, ril hole up somewhere 
until it's over. The Terra 
Hotel. You know it?" 

“No, but I'll find it." 

“I'll wait there for your 
call." He scowled at his glass, 
more relaxed now that the 
thing was done. “A hell of a 
situation,” he complained. “A 
thing like this could never 
happen on Earth." 

He didn't have to remind 
me that we weren't on Earth. 

T he office of the Dispar 
General was on the edge of 
the spaceport, down where 
the fat-bellied freighters lift- 
ed for home, their holds 
stuffed with meltin for an in- 
satiable market. Meltin could- 
n't exactly cure cancer, but it 
could arrest it. It could give 
immunity as well, and with 
something like over four bil- 
lion people clamoring for im- 
munity, it was in high de- 
mand. 

There wasn't a day, seem- 
ingly, when freighters didn't 
drop down to the spaceport, 
their holds stuffed with lux- 
ury goods. But it was a rare 
day when one of those same 
ships headed back to Earth. 
On the face of it the problem 
was a simple one : merely col- 
lect enough meltin to satisfy 

ORANGE 



the demand. But there were 
snags. 

One of them stared at me 
as I entered the office. He was 
a native Disparian, seven 
feet tall, lithe, dressed in a 
simple toga-type garment. His 
eyes were like jewels. 

“You want?" He question- 
ed. 

“My name is Ruby. I am 
acting as proxy for a man 
named Gray who has received 
notification of intent from 
someone called Orange. I 
wish to register myself as 
that proxy." 

From a desk behind the 
counter a form lifted itself 
into the air and fluttered 
down before me. A stylo 
thrust itself into my hand. I 
wasn't startled; it had hap- 
pened to me before. But I was 
impressed. 

“Fill out the document. 
Sign it and place the imprints 
of the balls of both your 
thumbs on the sheet." The 
Disparian was bored. “You 
know what to do; this is not 
the first time you have done 
it." 

His voice had no tone. It 
would have sounded the same 
in empty space. Telepaths 
have no need to communicate 
by sound vibration, and each 
and every Disparian was 
more than just a telepath. It 
was their mental powers — 
their psi faculties, to quote 
the long-hairs — that made 
them ab^solute masters of 
their world. 

117 




I filled in the form, signed 
it, placed the balls of both 
thumbs on the sensitized sur- 
face of the form. 

“You will notify the person 
concerned that I am official 
proxy for Gray?” 

“Yes.” 

With a normal man I would 
have swapped gossip, tried to 
find out, maybe, just which 
Orange the would-be killer 
was, paid for his address, per- 
haps— -things like that. With 
a Disparian that was impos- 
sible. How can you pump an 
utterly cold and remote con- 
ception of justice? You can’t. 
It would have been a waste 
of time to try. 

“Is there anything else?” 
He was polite, but distantly 
so. I had probably broken his 
communion with his fellows, 
or interrupted his game of 
telepathic patience, or what- 
ever Disparians did for 
amusement. 

“Thank you, no.” 

I walked out of the office, 
by choice a man now marked 
for death. I was Gray’s proxy, 
which meant that Orange, 
whoever he was, had to kill 
me, not Gray. If he succeeded, 
then Gray was officially dead. 
He would lose his concession 
and could do as he liked about 
staying or going home. If, on 
the other hand, I killed Or- 
ange, then no one could file 
intent against Gray for an- 
other three months. 

It was a hell of a way to 
earn a living. 



S URROUND a spaceport by 
warehouses, depositories, 
houses and bars, hotels and 
flop-joints. Add the big 
stores, the yeast and algae 
plants, the supply sheds. Cut 
it with a few roads, hang out 
a few lights, install a few 
phone booths. Squeeze too 
many people into too small an 
area. Dispar! 

I’d hated it for five years. 
I’d landed with high hopes 
and no money and had run 
smack up against some of the 
uglier facts of life. I’d almost 
starved before I cottoned on. 
Almost ran into debt, which 
was worse. Now, five years 
later, I had a face I hated to 
look at, a reputation no nor- 
mal man should be proud of. 
But I was beating the system. 

The bank was open all 
night. I entered, ignored the 
two guards and deposited five 
of the ten thousand Gray had 
given me. The teller was a 
serf, the silver of his collar 
bright against the jet of his 
skin. He fingered my money 
with loving hands. 

“Doing well, Mr. Ruby?” 
“Doing well, Mr. Black.” 
He stamped my passbook 
and handed it back, envy in 
his eyes. He was surrounded 
by money and couldn’t touch 
a minim of it. He worked for 
bed, board and a reduction of 
his debt. He would probably 
die long before he had cleared 
it. 

A man brushed past me as 
I left the bank. The lights 



118 



E. C. TUBB 




shone on puce clothing, puce 
shoes, puce skin. He looked at 
me with puce eyes. Puce 
wasn't orange, so it didn't 
worry me. 

I dropped into a phone 
booth and checked on Orange. 
Fifty-two were listed, any of 
which could be the one gun- 
ning for Gray. Gunning for 
me, rather, or would be at 
dawn. 

I looked outside the booth. 
Puce was waiting near a cor- 
ner. I stepped out of the 
booth and held the door open, 
fumbling in my pocket as if 
for a coin. I looked helplessly 
at him. 

“Change," I said. “Could 
you oblige?" 

He came forward, and as 
he came within range, 1 re- 
leased my hold of the door 
and pushed him into the 
booth. I leaned my weight 
against the door, found a 
metal wedge in my pocket and 
thrust it home. He beat 
against the panel, yelled 
something I couldn't hear. I 
smiled at him and shook my 
head. As I walked away he 
was desperately using the 
phone. 

I had no time to waste — 
Puce had already fingered me. 
Come dawn, Orange would 
know just where to find me, 
would probably be waiting 
until the sun lifted so as to 
strike before 1 could protect 
myself. 

At the Bureau I checked 
the residents' ledger. Of the 

ORANGE 



fifty-two Oranges, I concen- 
trated only on those who had 
recently landed and coukl 
have had money enough to 
hire lookouts, and those who 
had been around long enough 
to have learned the ropes and 
maybe made friends. I elim- 
inated about half the number 
and felt lucky at that. It could 
have been a White who was 
after Gray; there were six 
hundred and thirty of them. 
Or Black, seven hundred and 
fifty-eight. Orange, fortunate- 
ly for me, was not a popular 
color. 

It was near dawn when I 
left the Bureau and I had to 
move fast. The supply clerk, 
a Brown, fingered his silver 
collar and looked wistfully at 
the Raging Hills in the dis- 
tance. 

“Supplies for a seven-day 
trip? You going to try a little 
poaching. Ruby?" 

“You know better than 
that," I said. 

“I know, but do you?" He 
studied me. “I guess you do. 
Well, what do you want? A 
car?" 

“I'll walk." Cars cost money 
to hire and could be seen for 
a mile. 

“Pack, rations, water, com- 
pass, medical kit, bush outiit, 
emergency radio — " 

“No radio." 

“It's the law." He added it 
to the heap of supplies. “You 
get into trouble, you press the 
button and they come out aft- 
er you." 

119 




“And charge you both arms 
and a leg.” 

“Practically,” he admitted. 
“But it could mean your life.” 
His fingers strayed to his col- 
lar. “Such as it is.” 

“I’ll take the radio. And a 
knife.” 

He added an eighteen-inch 
bush knife to the heap. He 
looked at me. He was no fool. 
“A gun?” 

“How much?” 

“Five thousand.” 

“No.” Five thousand for a 
single shot was too much. 
“How much do I owe?” 

“Two for the hire and five 
for the deposit.” He counted 
out the money I passed to 
him. “Good luck, Ruby.” 
“Thanks.” 

It was almost dawn. Time 
was running out. 

T he sun lifted before I was 
a furlong from town. 
Crouching beneath a spined 
bush, I watched my back- 
trail, wondering if Orange 
would be dumb enough to 
come straight out after me. 
He wasn’t that dumb. I wait- 
ed an hour and then had to 
move. I headed for the Rag- 
ing Hills. 

Nowhere in the Galaxy is 
there undergrowth like there 
is on Dispar. Every bush is 
covered with spines, each 
blade of grass is a tiny sword, 
the very leaves are jagged 
knives. Silicon, of course. 
Life on Dispar has evolved 
around it as we evolved 

120 



around carbon. And there is 
wild life, too — nasty wild 
life. 

I stepped from the narrow 
path made by some creature 
and let a shimmering thing of 
scales and claws lumber pa.st. 
It ignored me, but the insects 
didn’t. A group of them tried 
to bore a hole through my 
bush outfit. I brushed them 
off with a gloved hand and 
then stepped out again, trying 
not to let the twitching be- 
tween my shoulder blades get 
the better of me. 

Orange couldn’t be that 
close. 

I wondered about Orange 
as I forced my way through 
the undergrowth. A lot de- 
pended on just how expe- 
rienced he was. An amateur 
would hesitate, perhaps talk 
in order to bolster up his 
courage. A personal enemy 
would want to gloat. More 
important, a personal enemy 
would have no real satisfac- 
tion in killing a proxy. He 
might do it, but his motiva- 
tions wouldn’t be the same. 

A glinting web of spun 
glass dissolved beneath the 
slash of my bush knife. I took 
no trouble to hide my ti-ail. 1 
wanted Orange to follow me. 
Later, when I had reached 
the correct spot, then I would 
set my snare. 

A car drifted past over- 
head, the phutt — phutt — 
phutt of its rotors sounding 
a continent away. I stared up 
at it enviously. Some conces- 



E. C. TUBB 




sionaire, probably, going out 
to his leasehold, there to 
spend a few days collecting 
meltin, and earning, in those 
few days, more money than I 
saw in months. 

The car vanished in the 
distance toward the Raging 
Hills. The sound of the rotors 
faded and I hacked at the un- 
dergrowth with vicious exas- 
peration. Damn Dispar! And 
damn the Disparians for mak- 
ing life what it was ! 

It took most of two days to 
get where I was going. Some 
rocket ship had blasted a 
clearing in the vegetation 
way back before the space- 
port had been built, and the 
local shrubbery had only just 
managed to encroach on the 
fused area. I took trouble to 
leave no traces as I crossed 
the clearing, and when I fi- 
nally squatted down, it would 
have taken more than an ex- 
pert to guess at my presence. 
That done, I had nothing 
more to do but wait. 

I waited three days. 

O RANGE was more clever 
than I had guessed. He 
had employed tails, which 
was the reason I had left the 
city. Normally I would have 
met him on my own ground, 
but with paid shadows report- 
ing my every move, the dice 
were loaded against me. So I 
had left the city, hoping that 
he would come after me. It 
had been a calculated risk. He 
could have waited until my 

ORANGE 



supplies ran out, then am- 
bushed me on my return. 
That would have been the 
smart thing to have done. In- 
stead he had lost patience 
and, with luck, it would cost 
him his life. 

But it almost cost me 
mine. 

I’d made a hideout beneath 
a spined bush, scooping a 
shallow hole and lying in it 
so that I blended with the 
vegetation. From my position 
I could see every inch of the 
clearing, the trail I had fol- 
lowed being directly opposite 
to me. I wasn’t too worried at 
night. Not even the beasts 
could move around without 
sounding as if they’d run into 
a chandelier. But the days 
were something else. 

Lying in one position hour 
after hour, a man has to 
brush off the "borers, open his 
mask to take a drink or to eat, 
ease cramped muscles, a doz- 
en little moves. I’m pretty 
good at emulating a robot, but 
I have my limit. I’d opened a 
ration pack, eaten, taken a 
drink of water and had lim- 
bered up a little. I was just 
crawling back into my hole 
when a shot blasted the 
grdund before me. 

I should have had my head 
incinerated by the blast, but 
Orange had been just a shade 
too eager. The shot missed 
me, and before the echoes had 
died away, I was twenty 
yards distant, rolling with a 
sound of broken glass. A sec- 

121 




ond shot followed me. A third. 
Then I was in a crouch, my 
eyes searching the under- 
growth. 

It was quiet, too quiet. The 
tinkling and brittle snapping 
had died with the echo of the 
shots. From far away a car 
sent down a murmuring hum, 
but in the undergrowth life 
seemed to have paused in 
frozen immobility. 

Then I heard it. Something 
lunged through the bush. A 
shot blasted toward it. There 
was a deep, hissing roar, a 
scream and then a final shot. 
The hissing died into a liquid 
gurgle which faded as the 
creature died. It had probably 
saved my life, but I was too 
busy to feel sorry for it. It 
was dead, but I wasn’t sure 
about the gunner. 

I found Orange lying in a 
heap against the bole of a 
stunted tree. The animal was 
nearby, already thickly cov- 
ered with scavenger beetles. 
I crept forward, bush knife 
raised to deliver a killing 
blow, then dropped it as I 
came close enough for a good 
look. 

Orange was a woman. 

^VOU spared my life,” she 

A said. “Why?” 

It was a reasonable ques- 
tion. As official proxy, it was 
my duty to kill or be killed. 
Instead I had picked her up, 
checked her for damage, 
found an ugly gash on one 
thigh and had injected her 

122 



with the contents of my 
survival hypo. Given soon 
enough, the antibiotics would 
save her fi’om infection. 

“You’re a woman.” The ex- 
cuse sounded lame. “I’m cu- 
rious about why a woman 
should file intent to kill.” 
“Anything against it?” 
“No. It’s just unusual.” 

“I know.” She winced as 
she eased her thigh. “You 
think that a woman on Dis- 
par can make out quite nice- 
ly in other ways. Maybe some 
can. I don’t happen to be one 
of them.” 

“You’re not a killer either.” 
“Anyone can squeeze a trig- 
ger.” She didn’t look at me. 
“Well, when are you going to 
get it over?” 

She had courage. She had 
other things too — I could 
sense her femininity even 
through a double layer of 
bush clothing. Her orange- 
dyed skin, eyes and hair did 
nothing to spoil ' her pretti- 
ness. Killing her was some- 
thing I didn’t want to do. 

When the beast had attack- 
ed, it had scattered her 
equipment and supplies. I 
went back to my hideout and 
found what I’d been afraid 
of : her first shot had missed 
my head, but had incinerated 
my gear. 

I returned to where she lay 
and made a quick check. A 
canteen of water had escaped 
damage; a single ration was 
still edible. Aside from that 
we had nothing but the 



E. C. TUBB 




emergency; radios hooked to 
our belts. 

I picked up her rifle and ex- 
amined it. The magazine was 
empty. 

“Five shots at five thous- 
and a shot,” I said. “Add 
rental of other stuff, deposit 
and the rest, and it comes out 
to about fifty thousand.” 

“So?” 

“That’s a lot of money for 
a girl who only landed a cou- 
ple of weeks ago. Who put 
you up to it. Orange?” 

“You’re smart. Why ask 
me?” 

“Because I think that you 
are being used for a pigeon.” 
I sat down beside her. “I 
checked the residents’ ledger 
at the Bureau. I’ve got a good 
memory, but I discounted you 
as the killer. You just didn’t 
fit, a woman, fresh on Dis- 
-par, the rest of it. Why did 
you want to kill Gray?” 

“For his concession.” 

“Reason enough. In fact, 
it’s the only reason anyone 
would file intent to kill — the 
only logical reason, that is. 
Who briefed you. Orange?” 

“No one.” 

“But you knew about prox- 
ies ? You knew that I’d agreed 
to take Gray’s place?” I 
leaned back, the canteen in 
my hand. “You haven’t been 
on Dispar long enough to 
learn all you have picked up. 
How about coming clean, Or- 
ange ?” 

“Why should I? You’re go- 
ing to kill me anyway.” 

ORANGE 



“No, Orange, not me.” I 
climbed to my feet. “I’ll just 
walk away and leave you 
here. You’ve no food, no 
water, and you can’t eat the 
local produce. You’ll sit here 
for a while and maybe you’ll 
try to make it back to town. 
You’ll get panicky and thirsty 
and hungry. You’ll be alone 
arid you’ll get lost. You’ll dis- 
cover that you’re dying and 
then you’ll press the button 
on your radio. You know 
what happens then?” 

“A Disparian will come out 
for me.” 

“That’s right. And then 
you’ll get a bill for services 
rendered and you’ll have to 
pay it. If you can’t, you'll be 
sold into bondage and wear a 
silver collar. Can you guess 
what your life would be like 
then. Orange?” I stepped 
away from her. “No, I won’t 
kill you. I don’t have to.” 

I HAD gone maybe twenty 
yards before she called to 
me. She was scared. 

“Did you mean that? About 
me being sold into slavery?” 
“Bondage? Yes.” 

“It’s the same thing.” She 
frowned into the distance. 
“Ruby, why do they do it?” 
“It’s their system, the Dis- 
parians’.” 

“It’s a lousy system.” 

“It’s the one we’re stuck 
with.” I slipped an arm 
around her shoulders and 
heaved her to her feet. “Let’s 
get moving.” 

123 




“But you wanted to talk.” 
“We can do that on the 
way back to town.” 

She talked. Her story didn’t 
surprise me — I’d lost the ca- 
pacity for surprise some time 
ago — ^but it gave me time to 
think. But I wasn’t surprised. 

Dispar grew meltin and 
Earth wanted it. Normally 
we would have stepped in and 
taken what we wanted, but 
this time we couldn’t do that. 
Not when the natives could 
teleport themselves into the 
engine room of a spaceship 
and detonate it at will. Not 
when the enemy was a will- 
of-the-wisp no one could 
fight, bribe, browbeat or 
cheat. If Earth wanted melt- 
in, it had to get it on Dispar- 
ian terms. 

And so the system. The 
lucky ones had concessions to 
collect meltin and grew rich. 
The others worked for the 
lucky ones or killed them and 
took over their concessions. 
Others made out by supplying 
food and supplies without 
which human life on Dispar 
was impossible. The Dispar- 
ians had forced us to found a 
colony in which money was 
the keynote of survival. And 
they had done more. 

“You can’t kill anyone 
without their permission,” I 
explained. “When you land 
they do more than just give 
you a name and make you live 
up to it.” I glanced at her. 
“Why orange?” 

“Why ruby?” She shrug- 



ged. “I knew I had to play 
along. Orange used to be my 
favorite color.” 

“No more?” 

“What do you think?” She 
stumbled and I saved her 
from falling. She didn’t thank 
me ; the necessity for that had 
long since passed. “Why do 
they do it?” 

“Make us wear colors? A 
whim, a law, a state of mind 
— anything. There’s a lot 
about the Disparians we 
don’t know.” 

“Like what happens if you 
kill someone without their 
permission ?” 

“No. That I do know 
about.” It was something I 
didn’t like to think of. “They 
read minds and there’s no ap- 
peal. Stick to their rules and 
you’re all right. Defy them 
and that’s the end of you. A 
very unpleasant end it is too.” 

“You’ve seen it?” 

“Yes.” 

She didn’t pursue the sub- 
ject. 

She’d landed as we all land, 
full of high hopes and eager 
to get rich quick. The system 
had slapped her in the face as 
it does all of us. Dispar was 
no Eldorado, not unless you 
could get a concession. She 
didn’t get a concession, but 
she did get an offer. 

“It sounded so simple — 
These people would stake me 
and tell me exactly what I had 
to do.” 

“Pull a trigger and kill a 
man.” 



124 



E. C. TUBB 




“Yes.” If she flushed I 
couldn’t know it, not with her 
dyed skin. “So maybe it was 
a little raw, but so what? It 
was the system, they said, kill 
or be killed, and no one would 
think it bad. Just pull a trig- 
ger and collect.” 

“How much?” 

“Fifty thousand. I was to 
hand over the concession to 
the syndicate.” 

“Naturally.” 

I halted and gave her a 
drink of water. We’d eaten 
the ration long ago and the 
canteen was almost dry. With 
her damaged thigh we weren’t 
making good progress. I won- 
dered how she’d managed to 
find me. I asked. 

“They led me out and show- 
ed me about where you were 
and left me to do the job.” 

It was a logical outcome of 
the system, many trying to 
do what one couldn’t. And 
staying well within the regu- 
lations too ; I had no doubt of 
that. Each member of the 
syndicate would only do so 
much. One would watch me, 
another would supply her 
gear, others would lead her 
out into the underbrush. Or- 
ange was simply a chosen 
weapon, a finger to pull the 
trigger. She could have killed 
me easily, but something 
had prevented her aiming 
straight. She was no killer, no 
matter what she said. 

“Did they tell you why they 
picked a woman?” 

“I guessed. Even on Dispar 

ORANGE 



a man thinks of a woman as 
being weaker than himself. 
And, as you said, a woman 
can get by without having to 
risk her neck.” 

She stumbled again, and 
again I saved her. Beneath 
the dye were pale blotches. 

“And I am weaker than 
you.” 

“Right now, at least.” 

“It’s my leg.” She touched 
it and winced. Around us the 
undergrowth tinkled to the 
impact of a slight breeze. The 
sound was lonely, mournful. 
“Ruby.” 

“Yes?” 

“VVe aren’t going to make 
it, are we?” 

“We’ll make it.” 

She shook her head. “Alone 
you might have made it, not 
with me. I guess there’s only 
one thing I can do.” 

My hand caught hers as it 
reached for her belt. It felt 
soft and very helpless. I smil- 
ed into her eyes. 

“Not yours. Orange,” I told 
her.' 

My finger pressed the but- 
ton on my own radio. 

T he bill was a hundi’ed 
thousand, fifty for each of 
us. The Disparian who had 
come out and teleported us 
back to town was the twin 
brother to the one in the Dis- 
par General’s office. Or may- 
be he was the same one; I 
couldn’t tell and it didn’t 
make any difference. The bill 
was one hundred thousand, 

125 




and because I had pressed my 
button, I had to pay it. 

One-third of my passage 
money back to Earth; twice 
as much as I owned on Dis- 
par ; enough to make me wear 
a collar for the rest of my life. 
I didn’t want to wear a collar 
for any time at all. 

It had been a quick rescue. 
One second we had been in 
the undergrowth. There had 
been a snap of displaced air 
and a Disparian had stood be- 
side us. In less than a moment 
we had stood in the Dispar 
General’s office. I doubted if 
my heart had beaten once 
during the trip. It had made 
up for it since. 

Fear is a wonderful spur. 
The prospect of a life of bond- 
age had thrown my brain into 
top gear, oiled my tongue and 
sharpened my ideas. I had 
talked fast and logically and 
had won a little time. It was 
something I felt proud of. 
Gray wasn’t impressed. 

“So you failed,” he said. 
“Too bad.” 

“I’ve run into a little trou- 
ble, but I haven’t failed.” 

“No?” 

“I’m still alive. The trouble 
is nothing that money won’t 
take care of.” 

“So you told me.” He was 
casual. Why not? He would- 
n’t have to wear a collar. 

“The charge is a hundred 
thousand. Someone will have 
to pay it.” 

“Not me.” He sat up in his 
chair. “It has nothing to do 

126 



with me. You should have 
killed the woman.” 

“Woman?” I covered the 
distance between us in three 
strides. “How did you know 
it was a woman?” 

“You told me.” 

“No, I didn’t. All I told you 
was that the job was over and 
that I’d had to call for help.” 
Suspicions became certain- 
ties. “It was a setup, wasn’t 
it? You wanted to be safe and 
snug and thought up a scheme 
to protect yourself. Maybe all 
you concessionaires thought it 
up together — it fits well 
enough. Find a pigeon. Have 
that pigeon send you notifica- 
tion of intent. Hire a proxy 
and let them fight it out. 
Either way you’re safe. If 
your proxy wins, then you are 
safe for three more months. 
If the pigeon wins, then 
you’ve already arranged to 
have your forfeited conces- 
sion handed back. Against 
what you earn collecting melt- 
in, the cost was nothing.” 
“Pipe dreams.” 

“I think not.” 

“Who cares what you 
think? You’re just a hired 
killer and not such a good one 
at that. If you were, you 
would have killed the woman 
and not come whining to me.” 
He was confident, too confi- 
dent. I' looked around. The 
Terra Hotel was the ultimate 
in luxuj’y on Dispar. It took 
a mint to live there, another 
mint to live there in Gray’s 
style. Gray had the arrogant 



E. C. TUBB 




confidence of wealth. He was 
one of the aristocrats of Dis- 
par and now he was cracking 
the whip. 

“Look,” I said reasonably. 
“To you a hundred thousand 
isn't much. Can't you let me 
have it and get this thing 
squared up?” 

A smart man would have 
paid, but Gray wasn't smart, 
just gieedy. He yawned and 
pointed toward the door. 

“On your way. Ruby.” 

“How about the money?” 

“You can whistle for it.” 

He had me and he knew it. 
Unless 1 paid my debt, I 
would be sold, and a bonds- 
man couldn't file notification 
of intent. I couldn't harm him 
now or later. 

“So I’m disowned, is that 
it?” 

“That's it.” He said what 
I’d wanted to hear. He’d 
canceled my standing as his 
proxy and he could never 
deny it. “Now get out before 
I have you thrown out.” 

1 crossed the room and 
opened the door. Orange 
stood just outside where she 
had been waiting. She car- 
ried a bush knife in her hand. 
I stepped back as she entered 
the room. 

“There he is.” I pointed 
toward Gray. “I'm no longer 
his proxy. Kill him and get it 
over with.” 

M oney breeds more than 
arrogance. Ten years ear- 
lier Gray would have had to 



rely on himself, but now he 
had money and he was soft. 
He cringed in his chair as 
Orange advanced, the big 
knife lifted above her head, 
the light reflecting from the 
wicked blade. 

Gray didn't know, couldn't 
know that she wouldn't kill 
him. There was nothing pre- 
venting her but her own na- 
ture, but he didn’t know that. 
He gave a sound like a scream 
and dived for a desk. He 
turned, a gun in his hand. I 
could have smashed it from 
his hand, but there was no 
need. He had made me his 
official proxy, and until he 
officially resumed responsi- 
bility, he could no more kill 
Orange than she could kill 
him. 

But he tried. He held the 
gun with both hands and des- 
perately fought to squeeze 
the trigger. He finally man- 
aged that, but by that time 
the muzzle was pointing at 
the ceiling. He blew a hole in 
the plaster. 

I took the gun from his 
hand. “Take it easy. No need 
for witnesses.” 

“Save me!” He was shak- 
ing with fear. 

“I'm not your proxy. You 
disowned me, remember?” I 
winked at Orange. She wait- 
ed, lowering the knife and 
running her thumb along the 
edge. In her way she was an 
artist. 

“This isn't Earth, Gray,” I 
said. “Maybe you made a mis-

take in not remembering 
that. Sure, weVe got a strict- 
ly commercial society, but 
weVe got something else too. 
We've got the Disparians 
watching over us like a bunch 
of guardian angels." 

''Keep that woman away 
from me!" The knife seemed 
to fascinate Gray. He could- 
n't stop looking at it. 

"How long do you think a 
setup like this would last if 
men were free? Not long. Not 
when any man could take a 
gun and go hunting for 
meltin and wasn't too par- 
ticular who he shot to get it. 
You have a nice, safe money- 
making system here, Gray, 
you and the other concession- 
aires. It's a pity that you 
couldn't be satisfied with tak- 
ing a part instead of wanting 
it all.” 

I could have told him more, 
but there was no need. He al- 
ready knew the logic of the 
Disparians. Make a man your 
proxy and he is exactly that. 
The inability to kill or injure, 
instilled on landing, was re- 
placed. A man was permitted 
to defend himself oi* commit 
an official murder, but that 
was all. Gray had hred me as 
his proxy but, as yet, he 
hadn't made official notifica- 
tion of that fact. He ^vas vray 
out on a limb. 

"All right." He managed to 
look away from the knife. 
"What do you want?" 

"Money.” 

He recovered some of his 



courage. "You're a fool, 
Ruby, a bigger one because 
you don't know it. Maybe I 
did fire you, but as far as the 
Disparians are concerned, 
you're still my proxy. If this 
woman kills me, then she's in 
trouble." 

"No. I've told her that I'm 
no longer your proxy. They 
can read her mind and prove 
that." 

"Then you'll be in trouble. 
Until you notify the Dispar- 
ians, I can't protect myself." 

Orange lifted the knife. 
"Wait!" 

G ray was sweating. I 
could see the moisture on 
his forehead. "If you kill me, 
you'll be sorry. The setup 
here is based on fair play and 
logic. That means I have to 
be given a chance to defend 
myself or get someone to do 
it for me." 

"An intei-esting point." I 
nodded to Orange. She step- 
ped closer to Gray. "Of us 
three, only two have the abil- 
ity to kill. We could kill each 
other or Orange could kill me 
or I her. If she kills me, then 
she's in trouble because she 
knows that I'm no longer your 
proxy. If I kill her, the same. 
But she can kill you." 

"Then you get into trou- 
ble," said Gray savagely. "Do 
I have to remind you how un- 
pleasant it will be?" 

"It won't be pleasant," I 
admitted. "But as far as you 
are concerned, the question is

purely academic. By that 
time you’ll be dead.” 

He got the point. No mat- 
ter what he said, I wasn’t go- 
ing to stop Orange from 
using that knife. He broke as 
the blade swung toward him. 

“All right,” he said. “What 
do yO|U want?” 

I blocked the swing of the 
knife with my arm, while Or- 
ange turned the edge just in 
time, and I got down to busi- 
ness. I wanted a hundred 
thousand to clear my debt, 
plus a double passage home. 
I would have asked for more 
but for the fact that I could- 
n't get it. Even as it was, he 
didn’t like paying out. Orange 
wasn’t too big, but I more 
than made up for her 
weight. In effect, I was de- 
manding our combined weight 
in delivered meltin. 

“Wait a minute! How are 
you going to get away with 
this?” 

I knew what he meant. Or- 
ange had filed notification of 
intent and there was no time 
limit. One or the other had to 
be eliminated. 

“I’ve fixed that part of it.” 
I waved to the communicator. 
“Just transfer that money.” 
“But—” 

“It’s simple. Orange filed 
notification of intent. To wash 
it out. Orange must cease to 
exist. Well, Orange will cease 
to exist.” 

“You’ll kill her?” 

“In a way, yes.” 

The communicator hummed 



just then and Gray became 
busy giving me lots of his 
easily earned money. Orange 
dropped the knife and came 
into my arms. It was the first 
time I had held her like that 
and it was good. 

“No regrets?” I smiled into 
her eyes. 

“None.” 

“Not even — ?” I touched 
my acid-burned face. 

“Not eveh.” Her fingers 
were cool on my cheek. “Do 
you think it will work, 
Ruby?” 

“It will work.” 

I T WOULD too. I knew that. 

Old habits die hard and 
the Disparians were logical. 
When an Earthwoman mar- 
ried, she changed her name. 
Orange would legally die, her 
name erased from the Resi- 
dents’ Ledger and the notifi- 
cation of intent annulled. 
Gray would be back where he 
started^ a little poorer, but 
perhaps a lot wiser. And I 
would be the happiest man 
around. 

I touched Orange’s hair. 
Maybe we would leave Dispar, 
maybe not. It was a good 
world if you had money. With 
the money we had, we could 
start a small business or deal 
in bondservants. Open a res- 
taurant, maybe, or even study 
Disparian law. 

And Orange would look 
wonderful when her name 
and color were changed to 
Ruby. END

WHERE ARE WE GOING IN SPACE? 

You'll find the answers in SPACE AGE 
—America’s only magazine that “bridges 
the gap” between the technical journals 
and your local newspaper reports. 



A RE YOU AWARE that you have a 
^'personal stake in all the big missile 
shots, moon probes, satellite launchings, 
earth-bound space tests being made today? 

Well, you have. The age of space is 
exploding all around us. Government and 
Industry are spending billions in research 
and exploration so that generations to 
come will find a new kind of life — in 
space! Yes, we have already crossed the 
threshold of the greatest age in the his- 
tory of Man! And yet — 

Millions of Americans actually do not 
know or understand what it is all about 
when a missile or rocket is fired — when 
a satellite sends back its mysterious "Voice'' 
from space — when a volunteer enters a 
space research test chamber — when a new 
project is announced — what it costs . 

Not because they don't want to know 
but because they are lost somewhere in 
that big gap — informationwise — between 



technical publications and local news 
reports. 

Now that "gap" has been bridged. 
And here's how — 

SPACE AGE, a fascinating new maga- 
zine, shows you — in plain, non-technical, 
everyday language and superb illustrations 
— what this thrilling new age of space is 
all about — Man and Science, places and 
events, ideas and dreams. SPACE AGE 
explains clearly and factually, informatively 
and entertainingly, the conquest of space. 
Mankind's plunge into a booming new era.
