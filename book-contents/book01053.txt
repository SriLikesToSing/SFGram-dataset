YOU WERE SAYING? 



A LONG with complimentary 
and critical mail, editors re- 
ceive letters that roil their trou- 
bled sleep, as if their sleep 
needed roiling. Like this one, for 
instance : 

“I enjoyed your editorial on 
possible life-forms. You pointed 
out that vegetation lives off soil 
and air, herbivores live off vege- 
tation, and carnivores live off her- 
bivores. Well, here is a little food 
for thought: what lives off carni- 
vores? Judith L. Burgess, Carni- 
vore.” 

The obvious answer is soil and 
air, so that the whole thing comes 
full circle. But that’s dodging; soil 
and air do not live off anything. 
The omnivore does. Miss Bur- 
gess, and you must be an uncom- 
fortable date if you devour meat 
and won’t touch vegetables and 
desserts. As an omnivore, I de- 
clare with justifiable pride that 
this is the highest category in the 
gastronomical scale of evolution. 
The fact that we share the dis- 
tinction with bears, pigs and the 
raccoon family in no way miti- 
gates my pride. I can’t imagine 
what, if anything, can possibly 
surpass our all-purpose gullet. 

Miss Burgess and others may 
dispute the statement with Oscar 
Wilde’s description of English fox 
hunting as “The unspeakable in 
pursuit of the uneatable,” but she

and they and Mr. Wilde must 
then be prepared to deprive 
Eskimos and Orientals from 
membership in the human race. 
Not sharing our silly prejudices, 
these admirable peoples carry 
omnivoraciousness to its utterly 
logical extreme. They may not 
like fox, may consider it greatly 
inferior to raw wolverine or 
Pooch Cantonese Style, but any 
fox they harpoon or snare is 
going to be eaten, doggedly or 
otherwise. 

If the need ever be. Miss Bur- 
gess, you and the rest of us can — 
and will — eat every carnivore 
clean off the planet. 

Then there’s the letter from 
the worried chap whose obviously 
alien wife sajrs such things as: 
“The washee pot needs cough- 
ing.” In a recent communique, he 
added nervously: “My wife just 
told me, ‘If you don’t know how 
to be nice, don’t be at all.’ So, if 
you fail to hear from me, you’ll 
know what happened.” What 
makes him believe I will? I think 
I’d like to know, but I’m not real- 
ly sure. 

Another deponent to the case 
proving that There Are Aliens 
Among Us writes: 

“The indications are that these 
aliens come from planets with ex- 
treme temperatures. In the sum-

mer, people slap me on the back 
and ask if it is hot enough for 
me, it invariably being so. The 
conclusion I’ve arrived at is that 
these aliens possess a gadget im- 
bedded in their back for raising 
temperature and it sometimes 
goes out of whack and has to be 
jarred, like kicking a gum machine. 

“These same people slap me on 
the back in the winter, asking if 
it’s cold enough for me. Can a 
metamorphosis be this complete? 

“Several days ago, a stranger 
slipped on the splashed edge of 
the YMCA swimming pool and 
crashed into the water. When I 
helped haul him out, he said that 
he ‘must have slipped on some- 
thing wet.’ Does he come from a 
world where water is NOT wet? 

“I’m alarmed about some of 
‘our’ idioms, such as: ‘What time 
is it?’ What time is what?” 

Another reader sent in a clip- 
ping from the N.Y. Herald Trib- 
une about a “time capsule” dug 
up at Madison Square Park. A 
lead box 20 inches long and 7 
inches wide, it was located while 
dismantling an ornate water 
trough for horses. 

“The lead case contained a 
bronze table inscribed with the 
words ‘The Gift of Olivia Eggles- 
ton Phelps Stokes to the City of 
New York, August 1880.’ In- 
closed were a booklet entitled 
‘Colton’s Map of New York City’; 

6 



an 1880 YMCA periodical, ‘Faith 
and Works’; a copy of the New- 
York Herald, dated Dec. 2, 1880; 
a business card of James Muir, 
plumber and gas fitter at 29 E. 
18th St., and a copy of the Bible. 

“Miss Stokes, a philanthropist 
and daughter of a New York 
banking family, died at the age of 
81 on Dec. 14, 1927.” 

Presumably thinking that the 
itemized trivia was worth the cost 
of the lead box. If any further 
argument is needed against time 
capsules, there it is — pocketbook 
lint that Miss Phelps and her 
advisers, if any, thought would 
have enduring value — and we’re 
doing the same with cornerstones 
and capsules. 

I dislike advocating unsanitary 
measures, but letting junk accu- 
mulate (as in Bat Cave, New 
Mexico, where 6 feet of garbage 
flung down in 3,000 years gave 
an important clue to the origin 
of corn) would be a real boon to 
future archeologists. We owe that 
much to our distant begats, don’t 
we? 

Finally, someone sent in a 
squib about a 35 mm. camera 
found on the back seat of a taxi. 
Developed, the film had 20 shots 
of Lincoln delivering his Gettys- 
burg address. Big deal! Brady 
covered the event. But what about 
the cab fare there and back? 

And now — you were saying?

A WORLD CALLED 
MAANEREK

What were the forgotten memories that ate at 
the rim of his mind? Were they why he looked 
and felt so unlike his people? He knew there 
were answers . but they were not inside him!

T he glider followed the 

slope of Kettleback Fell, 
caught an updraft rising 
from Brann’s Dale and swung to- 
ward a blued-silver sky of twilit 



clouds. Above the cold white 
brawl of Skara River there lay a 
chill hazy air mass which sucked 
it down again. 

Vilyan’s hands were briefly 
frantic on the controls. Then he 
had crossed the river and was

once more upborne, until pres- 
ently he went above the timber- 
line. 

“We are close now, oath- 
brother,” he said. “Best you make 
ready.” 

Torrek nodded, left his seat 



and crawled down the narrow 
length of the fuselage. He felt 
the light fabric, oiled cloth drawn 
tight on a frame of hollow canes, 
shiver to his touch. It was very 
silent; somehow, the great boom- 
ing winds did not penetrate. 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



9 



Reaching the little trapdoor, he 
peered through its glass inset, 
down at a savage barrenness 
streaked with snowfields. He 
tested his arrangements — the 
coiled rope knotted to a crossbar, 
the three knives sheathed at his 
waist, the net which bound his 
long yellow hair to keep it from 
his eyes. Otherwise he wore only 
a loincloth, for he dared weigh 
no more than he must on this 
lethal errand. 

TTE WAS a big and supple 
young man, with a harsh 
bony cast to his face that made 
him an alien among the hand- 
some people of Dumethdin. And 
the name they had given him, 
Torrek, meant more than simply 
“stranger”— it hinted at a degree 
of monstrousness, for he alone of 
all folk under the Rings could not 
even guess at his parentage. Nev- 
ertheless, Clan and Lodge em- 
blems were tattooed on his face. 

“There’s the nest!” Sweat 
leaped out on Vilyan’s forehead, 
pearling the blue symbol etched 
there, the sign of Sea Bear Lodge 
in which he found sworn brother- 
hood with Torrek. His hands 
jerked, a bare trifle, on the sticks, 
and the glider shuddered. 

They had climbed high, until 
now they were slipping along that 
gaunt dark mountaintop called 
the Skara Man’s Hat. On a windy 
crag overlooking three thousand 



feet of cold sky, there was raised 
an enormous, disorderly heap of 
branches, welded with the decay 
of centuries into one fortre.ss 
mass. As far back as tradition re- 
membered, krakas had nested 
here. 

Certain Elders, far down in 
Diupa, thought it an unholy work 
to slay the kraka, for she had 
been there so long, and her moth- 
ers and grandmothers before her, 
reaving the valleys below. If the 
kraka sat no longer on the Skara 
Man’s Hat, menace brooding over 
Fenga Fjord, there would be an 
emptiness in the sky. 

Folk whose livestock and small 
children had been carried up to 
these unclimbable heights thought 
otherwise. 

Vilyan’s dark reckless face split 
in a sudden grinning tautness. 
“There she comes herself, oath- 
brother!” 

“Good,” grunted Torrek. 

“May Ellevil and the Moon 
Lady ward you — ” 

“Hold her steady now,” Torrek 
interrupted harshly. 

One who did not know him 
might have been offended at such 
surliness, even when death beat 
upwind to meet him, but in Diupa 
they thought they understood 
th“h changeling. You could not 
look for ease, or mirth, or even 
much courtesy, from one whose 
life had been so hideously up- 
rooted. His brain, they thought. 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



must still be plowed with the 
scars of memory torn loose, five 
years ago. 

Therefore Vilyan only nodded. 
But when Torrek had left the 
glider and Vilyan was bringing it 
back toward the fisher town — for 
he could not hover in this home 
of the warring winds — he sang 
the Long Faring Song for those 
who have gone away to battle 
and are not likely to return. 

^ I ■’ORREK opened the little 
door, threw out the rope and 
slid down its length. One of his 
daggers was gripped between his 
teeth. 

For long, ghastly minutes, he 
swung like a bell clapper, more 
than a mile above the fjord. Now 
he could hear the wind, a huge 
hollow roaring through the blue 
dusk. Its force streamed him 
ahead at the rope’s end. 

The challenge of the kraka cut 
through to him. She came thresh- 
ing upward from her nest, blind 
with murder, for at this time of 
year she had young in the nest 
and that thing of stiff wings dared 
fly over them! Almost, she hurled 
herself straight at the glider — 
her mother had thus crashed one, 
a man’s lifetime ago. But then, as 
Torrek had planned, she saw him 
dangling like bait on a fish hook, 
and she veered and plunged to- 
ward him. 

The man felt a final tightening 



of nerve and muscle. His eyes 
seemed to gain an ultimate clar- 
ity, his ears to be whetted until 
they heard the crashing of Smoky 
Falls where Skara plunged down 
the Steeps, time to slow until the 
onrushing kraka poised in midair 
and he could count the stripes on 
her tawny hide after each giant 
wingbeat. But he was not afraid. 
In a bare five years of remem- 
bered life, there is small time to 
learn the habits called fear. 

Then the kraka struck. 

She was a little smaller than 
he, discounting the thirty-foot 
span of leathery wings and the 
long rudder-shaped tail. But her 
four feet ended in talons which 
had been known to split men at 
one blow and her muzzle held 
saber teeth. Few people, hanging 
one-handed from a cord, could 
have kept from pitching down- 
ward to escape. 

Torrek drew himself up, at the 
last instant, into a ball. As the 
winged thunderbolt shot below 
him, he let go. His legs closed 
around the lean belly, his left 
arm around the neck, and his 
right hand thrust a dagger into 
her throat. 

She screamed. 

For a few wild seconds, she 
threshed and bucked and writhed 
in the air, seeking to hurl him off. 
His knife was torn from his grasp 
and sparkled meteoric downward. 
He needed both arms and every 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



11 



draining drop of strength to keep 
his place. 

Then his weight became too 
much for her and they slid down 
the wind toward the sterile slopes. 
Her wings, flailing the sky, slowed 
that fall somewhat, turned it into 
a long glide . and meanwhile 
Torrek had drawn another knife 
and was slashing methodically at 
her vitals. 

He felt no pity for this most 
splendid of animals — there were 
too many small bones up on 
Skara Man’s Hat. But he had a 
moment in which to think that 
she was brave. 

And a moment, incredibly high 
in the air, to look over the misty 
woods and the green depths of 
Brann’s Dale, across Smol^ Falls 
and the narrow fields that men 
had plowed between the cliffs and 
the fjord, to Diupa town. 

More: he could see across 
Fenga Fjord to Holstok and the 
White River Delta, a low rich 
land fair for the harvest. He could 
see the narrow end of the bay 
and follow its windings north- 
ward between sheer rock to the 
mouth. There, where the Roost 
foamed with an incoming tide, lay 
those guardian islands called the 
Merrv Men; and Torrek thought 
he could even see the grim walls 
of Ness, the fort on Big Ulli 
which watched lest the beast-hel- 
meted pirates of Illeneth descend 
again on Dumethdin. 



Out now the kraka was weak- 
ening, her blood spattering 
the blue twilight air, and as her 
wings beat less frantically, her 
fall became the faster. Clench- 
jawed, Torrek thought she would 
have her revenge by painting his 
flesh on the Steeps of Skara next 
to her own. 

Then, with a wobbling convul- 
sion, she staggered eastward 
again, and the updraft from the 
warmer plowed fields gave her a 
final helping hand, and it was the 
fjord into which she plunged. 

Torrek dived from her just be- 
fore she struck. He split the water 
with a force that drove him down 
and down into greenish depths 
until his eardrums popped their 
protest and a coraloid spear 
raked his flank. When he had fi- 
nally struggled back to the sur- 
face, his lungs seemed ready to 
explode. It was a long time before 
his gasping ceased. 

The kraka floated not far 
away, upborne by her enormous 
wings— dead. And the early lamps 
of Diupa glimmered within easy 
distance. 

“Well, old girl,” panted Torrek, 
“that was friendly of you. Now 
wait here and be so good as not 
to let the ollenbors find you and 
clean your bones — I want that 
striped hide!” 

He strode out for the town, 
wearily at first, but his strength 
came back with the swiftness he 



12 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



knew to be abnormal. Sometimes, 
alone with his own truncated soul 
at night, Torrek wondered if he 
were human ... or what? 

There were canoes putting out 
from the pier. His landing had 
been dimly espied by the towns- 
folk. Lean outriggered shapes 
clove murmurous waves, a hun- 
dred paddles struck the water in 
unison, and the colored paper 
lanterns hung at the stem posts 
were like seeking eyes. 

“Ohoyohoa!” A conch lowed 
after the ciy, and the brass throb 
, of gongs took up an underlying 
rhythm. “Ohoyohoa! May the sea 
give you up, O my beloved! May 
the sea surrender you living, 
ohoyohoa!" 

“Here I am!” called Torrek un- 
ceremoniously. 

The nearest boat veered. Mus- 
cular hands drew him up and 
soon the conches and gongs and 
voices roared victory. 

By the time the fleet had come 
back, dragging the slain kraka 
and bearing Torrek on a captain’s 
dais, the Diupa people had all 
swarmed to the dock. 

Masked and feather-cloaked, 
shaking their rattles and their 
weapons — crossbows, axes, war- 
mattocks, halberds, blowpipes — 
the young men of Sea Bear Lodge 
danced out the pride he had given 
them. Grave in their embroidered 
robes of scarlet and blue, his 
adoptive Clan Elders waited un- 



der glowing lanterns. Between the 
long, low, airy houses, of painted 
oilcloth and carved wood panels 
and peaked shingle roofs, the chil- 
dren and the maidens strewed 
flowers for him. 

Even the humblest farmers, ar- 
tisans, fishermen, with no more 
finery than a bast loincloth and a 
feather headdress, lifted their tri- 
dents and shouted his honor when 
he stepped among them. 

TTIGH over the mountains, the 
thin evening clouds broke 
apart. The sun was down, though 
it would not be dark for hours 
yet, here in the warm latitudes of 
the World Called Maanerek. But 
the sky showed an infinite clear 
blue, with two of the moons rid- 
ing high, nearly full. And enor- 
mous to the south lifted the rain- 
bow arch of the Rings, most holy 
bridge. 

It was the usual thing that the 
clouds of the long warm day — 
forty hours while the sun strode . 
over the Islands — should disperse 
as evening cooled toward night. 
Yet Torrek, with the fjord’s chill 
kiss still tingling on his skin, im- 
agined that all kindly Rymfar 
must be with him, to draw the 
curtain from the sky just as he 
stepped ashore to his people. 

His people. Now, for the first 
time, he felt a thawing in himself. 
These lithe, dark, high-cheeked 
folk had made him their own. 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK

when they found him speechless 
and helpless in, the fields, had 
taught him with the same patient 
kindliness they showed their chil- 
dren, had forgiven him the blun- 
ders and breaches inevitable to 
one not raised from birth in their 
ways. 

In return, he had sailed in their 
canoes — yes, fished and hunted 
and plowed the fields, had fought 
in ther lines when the robbers of 
Illeneth forced the Roost and 
entered Dumethdin. 

And the folk had given him 
rank according to his growing 
abilities, so that now he rated 
Pilot. 

But he had still been the waif. 
He had not truly bought back his 
life from them . until today. 

“Drink,” said Elder Yensa, 
handing him the ancient silver 
Cup of Council. 

Torrek went to one knee and 
drained the thin spiced wine. 

“Let your name be written on 
the scroll of Harpooners,” said 
Scribe Glamm, “and when next 
the Fleet goes forth after the sea 
snakes, may you wield a goodly 
spear and be rewarded with the 
share due to your work.” 

Torrek bowed. “I am unwor- 
thy, Reverend Uncle,” he said. 

In fact, he knew very well he 
deserved the elevated rank. He 
had expected to gain it, if he 
lived. Now — 

He straightened and his eyes 



went to the young women, re- 
spectfully waiting on the edge of 
lantern light. 

Sonna saw him and looked 
down. A slow flush crept up her 
cheeks. She lowered her head un- 
til the long dark garlanded hair 
hid the small face from him. 

“Reverend Uncle,” said Torrek, 
bowing to the gray man of Ko- 
rath Clan who watched him from 
shrewd eyes, “a Harpooner is of 
rank sufficient to speak as friends 
with the child of a Captain. Is it 
not so?” 

“It is so,” agreed Baelg. 

“Then have I your consent to 
go into the mountains with your 
daughter Sonna?” 

“If she is willing, that is my 
will,” said Baelg. A grin twitched 
his short beard. “And I believe 
she is. But you must rest yourself 
first.” 

“I will rest in the mountains. 
Reverend Uncle.” 

“A mighty man indeed!” said 
Baelg, while the young men 
flashed teeth in admiration. “Go, 
then, and if the will of you two 
be later for marriage, I shall not 
look askance.” 

S ILENTLY Torrek bowed to 
the Elders, to the Scribe, to 
the Councilors of Diupa and the 
Viceroy of the King of Dumeth- 
din. Sonna fell behind him, 
matching his long strides. In a 
few minutes, they were beyond 



14 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the town, on a road which wound 
through fields up into the moun- 
tains. 

“I could have stayed for the 
feasting, Sonna, if you wished,” 
he said awkwardly. “Perhaps I 
was too hasty.” 

“You were not too hasty for 
me,” she answered with an enor- 
mous gentleness. “I have been 
waiting a long time for this 
night.” 

The road became a narrow 
trail winding upward between 
great cool fronds, under soughing 
leaves. There was a damp green 
smell in the air and a rushing 
■noise of waterfalls. Here many 
caves were found, and a young 
man and woman could lie in their 
shelter on beds of gathered blos- 
soms, eating wild fruits and split- 
ting the hard-shelled skalli nuts, 
through all the long light night of 
the World Called Maanerek. 

As their trail, a ledge which 
tumbled down through a deepen- 
ing purple twilight, led them 
briefly out of the forest, Torrek 
and Sonna saw the Inner Moon 
rise and go hurtling across the 
sky. There were four outer moons 
visible now among the few soft 
stars, as well as the shuddering 
bands of the Rings, and they built 
sharded bridges of light on Fenga 
Fjord and across the ocean be- 
yond. 

Distantly, inaudibly from here, 
a lacy curtain of white spray 



broke around the Merry Men, as 
one of the tidal bores which 
guarded Dumethdin and chal- 
lenged her sailors came roaring in 
through the Roost. 

Sonna sighed and took his arm. 
“Wait a little,” she said quietly. 
“I have never seen it so beautiful 
before.” 

A curious, angry emotion stirred 
in Torrek. He stood stiff and sa- 
vored the bitterness of it until he 
knew what it was: a resentful 
jealousy of others who had trod 
this path with her. 

But that was a crazy, ugly thing 
to feel, he told himself in bewil- 
derment — considering a woman, 
an unwed girl who had pledged 
herself to no man as yet, to be 
property: to rage when she acted 
like a free human creature, as he 
might rightly rage at someone 
who used his personal flensing 
tools! 

He bit off the insane feeling 
and spat it out, but the after-taste 
remained, a gray doubt of him- 
self. 

Who am I? 

“There is grief in you, Torrek,” 
murmured Sonna. 

“It is nothing,” he answered. 

Why am I? 

“No ... I can feel it in you. 
Your arm became suddenly like 
wood.” Her fingers stroked down 
its muscled length, tickling the 
gold hairs which also set him off 
from the brown smooth men of 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



15 



Dumethdin. “It is not right that 
you should know grief.” 

“Let us choose a cave,” he said 
in a voice that grated like a hull 
on a rocky reef. 

“No, wait, Torrek.” She searched 
his moonlit face with dark oblique 
eyes. “I will not spend a night 
with rage and sorrow up here . 
not beside you.” 

TTE FELT a dizziness. In spite 
of Baelg’s words, it had been 
too much to hope that Sonna 
would ever — 

“Ever wed a nameless man,” 
he mumbled without thinking. 

She smiled, a smile of victory, 
but stepped past the main issue 
to say: “Not nameless. You are 
fully adopted, Torrek. You know 
that. And after today’s work — ” 
“It is not enough,” he said in 
returning despair. “I will always 
be the one without roots, the tor- 
rek whom they found in the 
plowed fields five years ago, 
speechless, kinless, memoryless. I 
might be a child of hill trolls, for 
all I will ever know!” 

“Or a child of the Rymfar,” 
said Sonna, “or of the black Flit- 
ters they tell of among the moun- 
tain tribes. What of it? You are 
yourself and only yourself.” 

He was shocked. The idea of 
a human existing as a single crea- 
ture, self-sufficient, part of no 
Clan or Lodge or Nation, and 
with no need to be a part, was 



unheard-of. Sonna was a woods- 
witch to voice it! 

And then, as if a bolt had 
clicked home, he imderstood the 
rightness of the idea. It was not 
that he lost his wistfulness — he 
would always long for a blood 
kinship that had been denied him 
— but his lonely status was no 
longer a monstrosity. He was dif- 
ferent, yes, even crippled in a 
way, but he was not unnatural. 

For another slow moment, he 
stood wondering why Sonna’s 
carelessly tossed-off words, whose 
implications she could not really 
have grasped, should so bite into 
him. It was almost as if she had 
touched and awakened a memory 
of — 

“No more!” he exclaimed, 
laughing aloud. “The night is not 
so long that we can stand here 
wasting it.” 

“No,” breathed Sonna demure- 
ly. Her hand stole into his. 

There came a humming in the 
sky. 

Briefly, Torrek was puzzled. 
Then as the noise grew, and he 
heard the whine of simdered air 
behind it, the hair stood up along 
his back. 

He had only brought his re- 
maining knife for weapon. It 
jumped into his hand. He shoved 
Sonna roughly against the cliff 
wall and stood in front of her, 
peering upward. Moonlight daz- 
zled him. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The black shape crossed the 
Rings and slid down an invisible 
wire, and one end of the wire was 
pegged to him. It came too fast 
for thought, too fast for a dash 
back into the woods. Torrek had 
not yet grasped the size of the 
thing, twice the length of a long- 
boat, when it halted by the ledge. 
It hung there and speared him. 

O OTHER word — he was 
^ held, pressed against the cliff 
by a rubbery force he could not 
see. When he roared and hurled 
all the weight and strength he 
owned against that net, it threw 
him back onto Sonna with a fury 
that knocked a gasp from her. 

“Torrek,” she whispered. Her 
hands groped at his waist, blindly 
in the pitiless unreal moonlight. 
“Torrek, do you know — ” 

He did not. He had no memory 
of this lean, dully black fish shape 
. and yet it did not quite seem 
a thing from nightmare, not quite 
the vengeful ghost of the kraka. 
Somehow, he could accept it, as 
he might accept a new and dead- 
ly kind of animal. 

“It’s not a glider,” he said 
through clenched jaws. “No wings. 
But it’s been forged or cast — 
metal.” 

“The Flitters.” Her voice shook. 
He gave it some thought, stand- 
ing there pinned in the racking 
earthquake of his own heart. The 
Flitters were a tale, a rumor, a 



recent mumble among the inland 
barbarians. This had been seen, 
that had happened, strange fly- 
ings and curiously dressed men . 

A circular door opened in the 
flank of the — ship? Beyond it 
was a similar one which also 
opened. A metal gangway pro- 
truded, tongue-fashion, to the 
ledge. 

Torrek could not see inside, 
but the light that spilled forth 
was hellishly brilliant. It so 
stunned his eyes that those who 
walked over the gangway became 
no more than shadows. 

When they reached him and 
stood staring, he could see a little 
better. They were big men, with 
something of himself in their fea- 
tures and coloring. But they were 
wrapped from boots to neck in 
drab one-piece garments and they 
wore massive round helmets. 

Behind him, Sonna whimpered. 

The men talked to each other. 
It was a language Torrek had not 
heard, a choppy unmusical 
tongue, but there was no great 
excitement in the tones. These 
men were doing a routine job. 

Through a haze of anger, Tor- 
rek saw them reach some kind of 
decision — it seemed to involve 
Sonna rather than him — and go 
to work. They cast supple cords 
into the unseen force-mesh, nooses 
that closed on him and were 
drawn taut until he was trussed 
up like a wooly for slaughter. 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK

NE of them waved an arm in 
signal. Torrek fell to the rock 
as the force died away. Sonna 
sprang past him, spitting her fury. 
A man grinned, side-stepped her 
rush and grabbed an arm, which 
he forced behind her back. She 
went to her knees with a cry and 
was quickly bound. 

“What are they doing?” she 
cried in alarm. “Torrek, beloved, 
what do they want?” 

“I don’t know,” he said. 

He was slowly overcoming his 
own helpless wrath, forcing it to 
the ground as if it were his op- 
ponent in a wrestling rhatch. A 
great chill watchfulness rose in 
its place. 

“O my dearest—” wept Sonna. 

It cracked across Torrek’s 
heart. He mumbled some mean- 
ingless comfort or other. Inward- 
ly, he thought of knives for these 
grinning, chattering bandits in 
hideous clothes. He thought of 
hanging their heads in Diupa’s 
smokehouse. 

Sonna writhed and tried to bite 
when they picked her up and 
took her inside the ship. It earned 
her nothing but a stunning cuff. 
Torrek conserved his strength, 
watching the metal bleakness 
through which he was borne. 

Lashed in a chair, he had a 
view of the sky and the Steeps 
through a kind of — no, not win- 
dow, nor telescope — image-mak- 
er? He focused on that, ignoring 



the alienness of furnishings 
around him. Even when the ship 
rose noiselessly into the sky, and 
the highest peaks fell out of sight, 
and Sonna’s courage broke in a 
raw scream, Torrek remained 
watching the view. 

But when the stars harshened 
and came forth in their hundreds, 
when the great bowl of the world 
turned into a ringed shield daz- 
zling against darkness, and Sonna 
clenched her eyes and would not 
look ... he had an eerie sense of 
homecoming. 

Almost, he knew the monster 
mother ship would be waiting 
there and would draw this little 
boat into herself. 

Was it only the speculations of 
Diupa’s philosophers, or did he 
remember as a fact that the 
World Called Maanerek was 
merely a single one of uncount- 
ably many? 

He shivered at a ghostly 
thought, a thin frightened wisp of 
— recollection? — of how cruel 
and alien those worlds could be. 

'■^ORREK whirled, in the nar- 
rowness of the cell where 
they had caged him. One hand 
snatched for his knife. When he 
remembered it was gone, his teeth 
clicked together, as if closing in a 
throat. 

Sonna caught his arm. “No,” 
she said. 

He came back to humanness 



18

like one awakening from a dream. 
The carnivore light faded as he 
looked down at her. 

“What?” he asked vaguely. 

“It is no use to fight them,” she 
said. “Not till we know more.” 

He nodded stiffly, as if his neck- 
bones creaked. Then he held her 
in his arms and glared at the men 
who were opening the door. 

The younger one raised a weap- 
on. At least Torrek supposed it 
was a weapon, shaped like a very 
small blowgun, but grasped in a 
single fist. This person, or troll, or 
whatever he was, seemed heal- 
thier than his fellows; his skin 
had a normal weatherbeaten look, 
not the dead paleness of the 
others, and he moved with a mus- 
cular assurance. He was almost as 
big as Torrek, with the same yel- 
low hair cropped short, fjut with 
a beak of a nose and a rigid set 
to his lips. 

He spoke. It was a heavily ac- 
cented version of the Naesevis 
tongue, the common mercantile 
language of the Islands. Torrek 
was not expert in it himself, 
though so wealthy a nation as 
Dumethdin naturally attracted 
many traders, but it was near 
enough kin to that spoken along 
Fenga Fjord for him to use. 

“Best you do not attack me. 
This gun — this weapon shoots a 
— it can put you to sleep instant- 
ly. Awaking from such a sleep is 
painful.” 



Torrek spat on the floor. 

“You do understand me, do 
you not?” 

“Yes,” said Torrek, “I under- 
stand you.” The pronoun he 
chose was insulting, but the 
stranger did not seem to know 
the difference. 

“Good. I am Coan Smit. This 
man beside me is the learned 
Frain Horlam.” 

The other was little and old, 
with thin gray hair and blinking 
watery eyes. Like Coan Smit, he 
wore a plain greenish coverall, 
but lacked the young man’s in- 
signia. 

“What do you call yourself?” 
Smit asked. 

“I am Torrek, a Harpooner of 
Diupa, adopted to the Bua Clan 
and an oath-brother in full stand- 
ing of Sea Bear Lodge, pledged 
to the King of Dumethdin.” 

It was another insult: anyone 
who knew Naesevis should have 
been familiar enough with the 
symbology of the Islands to read 
Torrek’s allegiances off his tat- 
toos. Once more, it made no im- 
pression. 

I^OT at all offended, Smit 

^ grinned briefly and said 
something to Frain Horlam, who 
nodded with a curious eagerness. 
Then, turning back to his prison- 
ers, Smit went on in a careful 
tone; “Thank you. I want you to 
understand, Torrek, that we are 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



19 



your friends. We are, in fact, your 
people, and you are about to be 
given back your rightful heri- 
tage.” 

As from an immense distance, 
Torrek heard Sonna’s indrawn 
gasp. He himself felt no great 
shock. The knowledge had been 
growing within him since that 
sky-boat came through darkness 
to grip him fast. In part, it was 
that he looked like these folk. But 
in a deeper part, Isdng beyond all 
words, this was something he sim- 
ply knew. 

It was a cold and poisoned 
knowledge. 

“Well, what have you to say 
further?” he demanded curtly. 

“If you will come with us, we 
will take you to a place where it 
can better be explained.” 

“I will do so, provided this 
woman come with me.” 

“No, it is best she stay. There 
would be too much trouble; even 
without her, it will be hard 
enough to make things clear to 
you.” 

“Let it be so, my dear one,” 
mumbled Sonna. There was a 
beaten weariness about her. She 
had seen and suffered too much 
in too short a time. 

Torrek saw how the unhuman- 
ly stiff manner of Coan Smit, a 
manner of metal, broke open as 
his eyes drifted down the girl 
where she stood. Almost, then, 
Torrek seized Smit in the grip of 

ao 



a wrestler, to crack his spine 
across a knee. 

He choked back his rage and 
the icy wariness that replaced it 
was so unlike Dumethdin’s warm 
folk — it branded him so sharply 
as one of this witch-race — that 
he slumped and grew saddened. 

“Let us go,” he said. 

As he followed Horlam down a 
glaring bare corridor, with Smit 
and Smif s weapon at his back, he 
turned over his last glimpse of 
Sonna: a small figure at the 
barred door, all alone in a cage. 

TT WAS not to a room where 
-*■ he could look out on the arro- 
gant stars and the cool ringed 
shield which was his home that 
they took him. Their walking 
ended down in the guts of the 
ship, in a great chamber which 
was a flashing, blinking, quiver- 
ing, humming wilderness of philo- 
sophic apparatus. 

“Sit down, Torrek,” invited 
Smit. 

The Diupa man crouched back 
from the chair, for it was an ugly 
thing of wires, instruments and 
shackles. 

“On the floor, perhaps — not in 
that,” he answered. 

“You will sit in that chair,” 
Smit told him, hefting his weapon, 
“and permit yourself to be bound 
into it. Whether you do so freely 
or let me knock you out with this 
gun is your affair.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Torrek snarled at him. Smit 
was standing too far, too ready, 
for a leap. Therefore Torrek 
yielded. As Horlam closed the 
steel bands which locked him by 
wrists, waist and ankles to the 
chair, his lips moved, invoking the 
nine evils on Coan Smit, 

Horlam lowered a grid of wires 
and less comprehensible things 
onto Torrek’s head and began ad- 
justing it in various ways. Smit 
pulled up a chair for himself, 
sheathed his gun and crossed his 
legs. 

“Well,” he said, “this will take a 
little time — to adjust the circuits, 
I mean — so I may as well tell 
you what you wish to know.” He 
grinned wryly. “It is hard to fig- 
ure where to begin. Some nations 
of men understand that the world 
is a round ball spinning about the 
sun and that the stars are other 
suns. I do not know if in your 
country — ” 

“I have heard such tales,” 
grunted Torrek. 

Till now, the imaginings of 
Diupa’s learned men had not 
seemed very plausible to him. But 
now he knew — beyond all reason, 
without needing as proof the fact 
of this ship — that Smit spoke the 
truth. But why did he know it so 
surely? 

“Very well, then,” said Smit. “It 
is a great distance from sun to 
sun, greater than men can truly 
understand. And there are more 



suns than have ever been fully 
counted. Nevertheless, men 
learned how to cross such dis- 
tances in ships like this, overcom- 
ing the barriers of space, time, 
heat, cold, weightlessness, air- 
lessness. Spreading from one 
world, very long ago, they strewed 
their seed on thousands of other 
worlds. 

“Then the Empire went down 
in wreck and men forgot,” Smit 
continued. “On planets like yours, 
far removed from the old centers 
of civilization, thinly populated at 
the time of the disaster — on such 
worlds, hardly a memory remains 
of the Empire and its fall.” 

^•"'ORREK shivered. It was not 
alone the weirdness of the 
tale, but this sense of having been 
told it once before, in some for- 
gotten dream. 

He said slowly: “There are leg- 
ends concerning those who ex- 
isted Before the Rymfar.” 

Smit nodded. “Of course. Not 
all knowledge was lost. On some 
worlds, a kind of civilization sur- 
vived. But only slowly, through 
numberless agonies, has it strug- 
gled back. The Empire has not 
yet been rebuilt; there are many 
separate nations of planets. Most 
of the Galaxy is still an unex- 
plored wilderness — But I am 
talking beside the point. 

“All right. This is a scout ship 
of a certain nation, your nation. 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK

which lies an enormous distance 
away. We have been cruising 
through this region of space for a 
number of years, mapping, study- 
ing . preparing the ground, in 
a way. Five years ago, we discov- 
ered your planet and tested a new 
procedure. 

“You are Korul Wanen, an offi- 
cer of this ship. Your memories — 
all your memories of your entire 
life — were stripped from you. 
You were left to be picked up by 
the Island folk. Now we are tak- 
ing you back.” 

Smit turned and waved an im- 
perious arm at one of the gray- 
robed men who stole meekly 
about, serving the switches and 
dials of the great machine. He let 
Torrek sit there with sweat spurt- 
ing out on the skin, while he gave 
an order. Then he faced back, 
grinning. 

“You don’t like it, do you, 
Korul Wanen?” he said. 

“It’s a lie!” croaked Torrek. 
“How could you have found me 
if-” 

“A good question. But I fear it 
will not disprove my assertions. 
You see, a small radiating — sig- 
naling unit, drawing its p>ower 
from your own body, was im- 
planted in a bone of yours, be- 
fore you were put down. We 
could locate you from many miles 
away.” 

“But no one would be so stu- 
pid!” roared Torrek. “I might 

22 



have died! The folk you say you 
left me with might have been 
cannibals and eaten me! What 
then could you possibly have 
gained?” 

“Nothing,” said Smit. “But nei- 
ther would we have lost anything 






— except one expendable unit of 
the crew.” 

^ I ^HERE was a certain avidness 
in Smit’s pale eyes. He was 
not telling this because there was 
any special need to, Torrek saw. 



He was telling it because he 
wanted to watch his prisoner 
squirm. 

Torrek stiffened. It was hard to 
remain calm, when his heart beat 
so heavily and his mouth was so 
dry. 




A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK

Why, he thought, in a remote, 
astonished part of his brain, I am 
afraid! This is what it feels like! 

The gray-robed person came 
back with a black cylinder the 
size of a man’s forearm and gave 
it to Smit, who handled it as one 
handles heavy objects. 

He smiled at Torrek. “In here,” 
he said, “is the ghost of Korul 
Wanen.” 

Torrek clamped lips together. 
He would not ask! 

“He will live again in his own 
body,” said Smit. “But first, of 
course, Torrek must be rubbed 
out.” 

That drew a howl. “No!” 

“Yes,” said Smit eagerly. 

He passed the cylinder to Hor- 
1am, who fitted it into the ma- 
chine next to another one. 

“You might turn over your 
memories one last time, Torrek. 
They will soon be nothing but a 
scribing in a tube.” 

Torrek struggled, uselessly, un- 
til he thought his muscles would 
burst. If they but would, he 
prayed in anguish, if he could 
only know clean death! 

As the dizziness and the dark- 
ness closed in on him, the ma- 
chine screaming inside his head 
until he felt it must rack his brain 
apart, he saw Smit lean closer to 
peer at him. The last thing of 
which Torrek the Harpooner had 
awareness was Smit’s look of en- 
joyment.

Korul Wanen 

TTE HEFTED the cylinder. 

“Five years!” he murmured. 
“Oh, it could hold several cen- 
turies’ worth of experience, my 
boy,” said Dr. Frain Horlam. 
“When you use individual mole- 
cules to store information—” 
Wanen looked up from the cyl- 
inder, across the desk to the aging 
psychologist. He was not certain 
how to act. On the one hand, the 
old fellow was a non-Cadre civil- 
ian; as such, he rated scant re- 
spect from a lieutenant in the 
Astro service. On the other hand, 
Horlam was in charge of the ma- 
jor scientific undertaking of this 
expedition, and on an exploratory 
trip, such work was subordinate 
only to the gathering of militech- 
nic data. 

Therefore Wanen said with a 
carefully noncommittal courtesy: 
“The theory of this never was ex- 
plained to me. As long as you 
only wish me to make conversa- 
tion, with no subject assigned, 
perhaps you would be kind 
enough to instruct me.” 

Horlam’s gray head lifted. “In 
a rough way, if you like,” he said. 
He leaned back and took out a 
cigar. “Smoke?” 

“No!” Wanen collected himself. 
“You know I am an Academy 
man and therefore conditioned 
against vice.” 

“Why?” Horlam tossed the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



question off so casually, between 
puffs on his own cigar, that 
Wanen answered without think- 
ing; 

“In order to serve the Hegem- 
ony and the Cadre which guides 
it more efficiently — ” He jarred 
to a halt. “You’re deliberately 
baiting me!” 

“If you say so.” 

“These are not joking matters. 
Don’t make me report you.” 

“This ship is a starvish long 
way from home,” said Horlam, 
with no obvious relevance. “Seven 
years now since we left. Nobody 
back there knows where we are — 
we didn’t know ourselves just 
where we were going. The stars 
have changed position so much 
that the old Imperial astro data 
are no use at all, and space is so 
big, and there are so many stars 
— if we don’t come back, it will 
be hundreds of years, probably, 
before another Hegemony ship 
chances to come exploring around 
this way again.” 

Wanen’s uneasy puzzlement 
grew. It might only be the linger- 
ing strangeness of his experience. 
He had wanted to report for duty 
as soon as he awoke in the sick- 
bay cot, but they had made him 
rest for a while and then sent him 
to Horlam’s office. An informal 
talk was to probe his restored self 
and make certain he was once 
again fit to serve. But this was 
too informal! 



ffT¥THY do you say these 
” things?” Wanen asked in 
a very low, controlled voice. 
“They’re platitudes, but your tone 
. somehow, it all borders on 
deviationism.” 

“For which I could be given 
anything on the scale of correc- 
tions, from a reprimand, up 
through death, to lobotomy or 
memory erasure — eh?” Horlam 
smiled around his cigar. “Never 
mind, boy. You must also know 
that there aren’t any secret police 
aboard to whom I could be re- 
ported. The reason I’m saying all 
this is that there are certain 
things I must tell you. I want to 
cushion the shock. This is your 
first deep-space voyage, isn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

“And you only had two years 
of it. Then you were mind- 
blanked and deposited on that 
planet. The rest of us have been 
batting around this part of the 
Galaxy for five years more. 
Things change under such condi- 
tions. There has to be a certain 
adjustment — a loosening of disci- 
pline, a letdown of idealism. 
You’ll see it for yourself. Don’t 
be unduly shocked. The Cadre 
knows the phenomenon well, al- 
lows for it.” 

Wanen realized suddenly that 
this was why deep-space men 
never returned to the home 
worlds of the Hegemony. When 
you had made your first really 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



25 



long voyage, you were never al- 
lowed closer to the Inner Stars 
than a year’s journey; your home 
became the great naval bases. 
You knew this in advance, and 
were told it was a matter of 
quarantine, and accepted the sac- 
rifice as a small offering to make 
for the Cadre. 

Now he saw that the disease he 
might conceivably be carrying, 
against which the people of the 
Inner Stars must forever be pro- 
tected, was not a physical one. 

“Very well,” he said, smiling his 
relief. “I understand.” 

“Glad to hear it,” said Hor- 
1am. “Makes things that much 
easier.” 

Wanen laid the cylinder on the 
desk, “But we were discussing 
this, were we not?” 

“Uh, yes. I was explaining the 
fundamental idea.” Horlam drew 
a breath and set forth on a lec- 
ture. “Memory patterns, including 
the unconscious habit patterns, 
are taken to be synaptic path- 
ways ‘grooved’ into the nervous 
system — if I may speak very 
loosely. The personality at any 
instant is a function of basic he- 
redity, physical constitution — 
health, diet and so on — and the 
accumulated total of these synap- 
tic paths. Now the paths, being 
physical, can be scanned, and, of 
course, whatever is scanned can 
be recorded. 

“Inside this cylinder is a com- 



plex protein whose molecules are 
selectively distorted to record the 
scanned data. But that’s detail. 
Whatever can be scanned can 
also be selectively heterodyned, 
canceled, rubbed out — call it 
what you like — leaving the adult 
body a memoryless, mindless 
hulk. But such a body relearns 
with astonishing speed; it be- 
comes a new, wholly functioning 
personality in less than a year. 

“If these new memories, such as 
those you acquired in the past 
five years, are scanned and can- 
celed, the recording of the old 
ones can be ‘played back,’ so to 
speak — reimposed on your ner- 
vous system. And thus Lieuten- 
ant Korul Wanen returns to life.” 

* I ^HE young man scowled. “I 
know all that,” he protested. 
“You explained it to me yourself 
when I got this assignment . 
but perhaps you’ve forgotten. Aft- 
er all, to you it happened five 
years ago. What I was interested 
in now were the more technical 
details: the type of signal used, 
for instance.” 

“I can’t tell you much,” said 
Horlam regretfully. 

“Classified? I’m sorry I asked.” 

“It’s not that classified. No, first 
is the fact that you would have 
to learn three new sciences for 
me to make sense to you. Second, 
it’s an ancient Imperial technique, 
totally lost during the Dark Ages.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



An exploratory ship found a 
wrecked machine and a set of 
handbooks in the ruins of a city 
on Balgut IV, about thirty years 
ago. Slowly and painfully, the re- 
search unit to which I belong has 
rebuilt the psychalyzer, as we call 
it, and learned a few things about 
it. But we’re still mostly groping 
in the dark.” 

“This record here — ” Wanen 
nodded at the cylinder, which 
stood on the desk like some crude 
idol —“you intend to study it, I 
imagine?” 

“Yes, but as an electronic phe- 
nomenon, not as a set of memo- 
ries per se, which it could only 
become by being reimposed on 
a living brain, which I suspect 
could only be your brain. But 
with our apparatus, we can make 
a point-by-point comparison of 
this record with the record we 
have of yourself as Wanen — run 
statistical analyses and so on. I’m 
especially interested in trying to 
find out precisely what patterns 
in the recording correspond to the 
learned elements of personality. 

“This was a totally new kind 
of experiment, you understand. 
Never before has the same body 
experienced two totally different 
cultures. Now we can really sepa- 
rate out the significant factors. 
Give my computers — and me — 
a few years to chew all the data 
and I may actually begin to know 
something about the human 



brain. Yes, you’ve performed a 
real service to science.” 

“I hope it is also a service to 
the Hegemony,” said Wanen. 

“Oh, it is. Consider what might 
be done about deviationism. At 
present, the psychalyzer can only 
wipe out the total memory of a 
non-loyal unit. The process of re- 
education from the ground up is 
slow and costly; lobotomy and re- 
duction to low civilian rank is a 
waste of good human potential. If 
we knew how, deviant tendencies 
could be corrected much more 
neatly, without sacrificing the de- 
viant’s skills and experience. In 
fact, perhaps conditioning could 
be made so thorough that no one 
would be physically able to have 
non-loyal thoughts.” 

It was such a splendid vision 
that Wanen jumped to his feet 
and blurted: “Thank you! Thank 
you for letting me serve!” 

Horlam knocked the ash off his 
cigar and nodded in a slow, some- 
how old fashion. “You’re all 
right,” he said in a dry voice. 
“You may report for duty.” 

^OAN SMIT had changed in 
^ five years. He was no longer 
quite the steel-hard, steel-proud 
Academy youngster who had for- 
ever left the Inner Stars in order 
to serve them more fully. 

Wanen grew only slowly aware 
of it, in the course of hours when 
they stood watch by the Number 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK

Five boat launcher, as they had 
done so many times before. Smit 
was still deft, crisp, neat. If his 
face had darkened, that was an 
honorable badge, given him by 
the sun and wind of the ringed 
planet. Wanen himself, after all, 
was even more deeply tanned, 
and added thereto was a barba- 
rian tattoo. 

But Smit was not absolutely 
Academy; the creases in his uni- 
form were merely knife-edged, his 
boots did not blind the eye. He 
stood properly straight, but with- 
out actually straining his muscles. 
He walked with the regulation 
pace, but was there the faintest 
hint of a swagger? 

When they were finally re- 
lieved, Smit yawned in a most 
un- Astro fashion. “Good to see 
you again, Lieutenant,” he said. 

“Thank you, Lieutenant,” said 
Wanen formally. 

“Let’s get a cup of coffee. I 
want to talk to you.” 

Their hard heels clacked on 
metal as they went down the pas- 
sage toward the junior officers’ 
wardroom. Wanen found himself 
noticing the enlisted men he 
passed. They had grown sloppier 
than the officers, not outrageous- 
ly so, but it was there; and when 
they saluted his insignia, he 
sensed an air of cringing. 

Many punishments must have 
been ordered aboard the Seeker 
in the last five years; sweatbox, 
28 



nerve-pulsing and worse. But that 
should not have been necessary 
... or should it? 

Wanen sighed in confusion. 
They raised you from birth to 
serve — his mind recited the com- 
forting Hierarchy: The unit which 
is called I serves the unit celled 
the Ship, which serves the Fleet, 
which is an arm of the almighty 
Hegemony and of the Cadre that 
guides us all toward the New Em- 
pire; there are no other loyalties. 

You were bred and raised for 
one purpose only, like all units 
below Cadre level. Your particu- 
lar purpose was to serve in the 
Outer Fleet. And that, of course, 
was right and good; but it was a 
narrow education that did not 
prepare you for the sudden im- 
pact of strangeness. 

For two years, while the Seeker 
hurtled through unmapped hun- 
dreds of parsecs, he had seen a 
little of the otherness which is 
deep space — just a little. Then 
five years dropped from his life 
and here he was again, in a ship 
which for half a decade had had 
the cold wild otherness seeping 
through her armor and — 

^ I ^HEY entered the small ward- 
room. No one else was pres- 
ent, Smit dialed for coffee and, 
when it came, sat cradling the hot 
cup in his hands for a while, as if 
he were chilled. 

“I saw you, of course, a good 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



many hours ago,” he said finally. 
“But you wouldn’t remember that. 
You were still Torrek then.” 

“Torrek?” Wanen raised his 
brows inquiringly. 

“That was your name, you said. 
Oh, you were a proper savage, I 
can tell you!” Smit chuckled. 
“Beautifully easy to bait, too. I 
hope you don’t —Hey!” 

Wanen yanked himself back 
barely in time. His hands were 
still crooked claws. He looked at 
them numbly and it came to him 
that they had curved to fit a 
man’s throat. 

“What are you doing?” gasped 
Smit. 

“I don’t know.” Wanen sat down 
again heavily and stared before 
him. “All of a sudden, a derange- 
ment. I wanted to kill you.” 

“Hm.” Smit recovered with the 
rapidity of disciplined nerves. He 
sat a little farther away, but his 
face grew calm again. After a 
moment, he said in a thoughtful 
tone: “Some underlying disturb- 
ance— yes, I suppose that’s it. A 
residual effect of the transforma- 
tion you’ve undergone.” He 
shrugged. “Well, why not? This is 
a new kind of experiment. You’d 
best see Horlam again, but I 
don’t imagine it’s anything too 
serious.” 

“Yes.” Wanen stood up. 

“Not now, you idiot! Relax. 
Drink your coffee. I want to dis- 
cuss matters with you. It’s impor- 



tant to our whole mission.” 

That brought Wanen back into 
his chair. “Proceed,” he said. If his 
heart still shivered, he kept it un- 
der control. 

“I hope the doctors can get that 
ugly tattoo off your face,” com- 
plained Smit. “It bothers every- 
body.” 

“It’s no worse than combat 
scars,” said Wanen huffily. 

“Oh, yes, it is. It stands for 
something different — something 
none of us want to be reminded 
of.” Smit glowered into his coffee 
for a little while longer before re- 
suming: “You recall that we 

found only two inhabited planets, 
both of them the usual wretched, 
uninteresting places, before com- 
ing on Ring here. That’s the nick- 
name the crew have given it: 
Ring. It’s important and exciting 
enough to rate a pet name. 

“You must also remember that 
our preliminary scoutings showed 
it to be an unusually fertile planet 
with a human population which 
had lost all traces of Empire 
civilization — but had, on the 
other hand, built up a rich variety 
of cultures for themselves. The 
highest society, technologically 
speaking, is in the Islands, the big 
subtropical archipelago. They’re 
just on the verge of printing and 
chemical explosives, and could 
easily come up with a scientific- 
industrial revolution. That’s the 
people we dropp>ed you among.” 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



29 



“Yes,” said Wanen. “I remem- 
ber seeing it from the air. They 
told me that was the place — ” His 
voice ran on, almost as if another 
mind were musing aloud. “There 
was a deep fjord, and towns along 
it, and mountains with long val- 
leys like green fingers reaching 
down to the water and — No, I’m 
not sure,” He rubbed his eyes. 
“Did I see clouds floating under 
a high peak? There was some- 
thing about a peak, like victory. 
No, I can’t recall.” 

TTE GREW aware that Smit 
was regarding him oddly, 
but the sense of exaltation re- 
mained within him. 

“Continue,” Wanen said. “You 
were bringing me up to date.” 
“Yes. I was. Well, then, we left 
Ring and for nearly five years 
more we’ve been prowling this 
part of the spiral arm.” 

“What did you find?” 

“Planets. Some with people on 
them. Nothing to compare with 
Ring. About six months ago, there- 
fore, we came back. I and some 
others went down on ethnic sur- 
vey in the Island region. I sup- 
pose you’ve heard something 
about the techniques. Kidnap a 
native, use accelerine and hypno- 
sis to get the language and basic 
cultural information from him in 
a hurry, then dispose of him and 
go out yourself. Claim to be a for- 
eigner from some other country. 



It works pretty well with societies 
that know there are other nations 
‘beyond the horizon,’ but don’t 
know exactly what they’re like.” 
“Whafs a Boats man doing in 
ethnic survey?” 

“You’re Boats, too. Lieutenant.” 
“That’s different. There were 
certain physical qualifications 
needed for the experiment, to give 
the blanked man a chance of sur- 
vival, and training was, of course, 
irrelevant. But you—” 

A bleakness crossed Smit’s face. 
“We’re short of ethnic specialists,” 
he said, “and war boats aren’t 
needed hereabouts. I had to fill 
in. So did a number of others.” 
“High casualties elsewhere?” 
“Yes.” 

“But — from primitives?” Wan- 
en was startled. “I thought they 
weren’t even supposed to know 
there were observers among them 
— let alone get unnecessarily an- 
tagonized — let alone kill our men 
with — with spears!” 

“All those things happened,” 
said Smit grimly. “The loss of 
quality — competence, adjusted- 
ness, efficiency, even loyalty— the 
decay of the entire crew was in- 
credible. In the case of the ethnic 
men, it was disastrous. See here. 
Lieutenant — half the casualties 
among survey terms were due to 
our having to shoot the men our- 
selves for radical deviationism.” 

. Wanen sat as if struck on the 
head. “No,” he whispered.

S MIT bared his teeth. It was 
not a smile, nor quite a snarl. 
“Yes. I’ve felt the tendencies in 
myself. What did you expect? 
Seven years of metal walls and 
celibacy!” 

“But we have Antisex. We have 
loyalty rallies — ” 

“Mere suppression of overt 
symptoms. Frustration continues 
to build up underneath, until it 
breaks loose in sheer destruction 
and negativism. Even a lifetime’s 
conditioning can’t survive that 
kind of pressure.” 

“But this can’t be the first 
time — ” 

“Of course not. It always hap- 
pens on a really long voyage. 
When the first troubles arose, the 
captain explained the phenome- 
non to all us officers.” 

“Well, then!” Wanen leaned 
back, sighing his relief. “So there 
must be a procedure in the Classi- 
fied Manuals.” 

“There is,” agreed Smit. “After 
casualties due to such causes ex- 
ceed a certain percentage, the 
ship is to find a backward planet. 
A certain small area is to be oc- 
cupied. Built-up aggressions may 
then be freely vented on its men 
and children. Antisex is discon- 
tinued and the local women made 
generally available.” 

Wanen felt a curious, sick re- 
luctance within himself. He 
couldn’t understand it. Even from 
an altruistic viewpoint, such meas- 



ures were for the good of the bar- 
barians, too, since the procedure 
was obviously essential to the ex- 
pansion of the Hegemony and the 
Hegemony would come at last to 
include all mankind everywhere 
in the Galaxy. 

Nevertheless, he could hardly 
get the words out: “So Ring has 
been picked?” 

“No,” said Smit. “The tension 
release I sp>oke of took place 
months ago, on the last planet we 
stopped at.” 

A second’s inexplicable relief 
was followed by a new tightness 
of soul. “Then why are we still 
here?” 

“Problems! A dilemma!” 

Smit shoved his empty cup 
away, got up and started pacing 
the floor. It was not the act of an 
Academy man, taught never to 
show uncertainty to the world. 

“You see, the Classified Man- 
uals further recommend that a 
ship return to base immediately 
after such release has been ef- 
fected. Otherwise — well, just con- 
sider the ordinary insignificant lit- 
tle enlisted man, the faceless unit 
among hundreds of other inter- 
changeable units. For a few 
weeks, he has been a conqueror, 
killing, whipping, flaying, burning, 
raping, drinking himself stupid 
every night. Resuming ship disci- 
pline and Antisex isn’t easy. In 
fact, if he isn’t pointed back to- 
ward normal surroundings at

once, the Cadre alone knows what 
deviationism can arise.” 

W ANEN said, “Having recov- 
ered me, why don’t we go 
home?” 

“We’ve got to occupy Ring,” 
said Smit shakily. “Not for the — 
the previous purpose. For mili- 
technic reasons.” 

“What? But I thought this was 
only a survey.” 

“Oh, it is. Or was. But look. The 
average backslid planet is a pret- 
ty miserable affair. It’s just natu- 
rally so hostile to human life that 
when the Empire broke up and 
all the artificial gadgets and props 



were destroyed, or rusted away, 
civilization went to maximum 
entropy in an obscene hurry. On 
most planets, Man simply became 
extinct. In the cases where adap- 
tation was possible, the normal 
outcome was savagery. 

“Ring, though, is a world where 
men can really feel at home. 
They’ve flourished! There are 
millions of them and they include 
some extremely able, sophisti- 
cated races. It’s almost as good a 
conquest as a unified planet with 
full industrial culture. 

“And remember. Lieutenant, 
we have mortal enemies. The Re- 
public, the Libertarian League,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Iflir 




the Royal Brotherhood, the High 
Earls of Morlan — there are a 
dozen other civilizations spread- 
ing into space, each with its own 
idea of what the New Empire 
should be like. We don’t dare let 
one of their scouts stumble on 
Ring. Whoever garrisons it first 
has got possession of it, at this 
distance from all naval bases.” 
“Easy now!” said Wanen. “What • 
are the odds of their finding 
Ring? A hundred billion stars in 
the Galaxy and this one to find 
among them all.” 

“And the GO stars are always 
investigated first,” Smit said, “and 
they’re not too common in this 



spiral arm, and we know there 
are League ships mapping it, too. 
It’s a finite chance, certainly — I 
know that — but one we dare not 
take. We must plant a garrison 
down there; it’s in the Manuals. 
Then we head back to base, re- 
port our find and have a task 
force sent which can take over 
the entire planet, fortify it prop- 
erly, civilize the inhabitants, and 
so on. 

“But it’ll take us nearly two 
years to get home — a year to or- 
ganize the task force, probably — 
two more years to come back — 

“Five years! Can we trust a 
garrison for five years?”

H ORLAM began unclipping 
the electrodes from Wanen’s 
head and body. His lips were 
pursed and he frowned, thinking. 

“Well?” exclaimed Wanen. On- 
ly after half a minute of silence 
did he realize how un-Astro it 
had been for him to reveal emo- 
tion before a non-Cadre civilian. 
What was wrong with him? 

“Well,” said Horlam presently, 
“according to every known ence- 
phalographic and neurographic 
technique, you have no surviving 
memories of your stay on Ring.” 
“Are you certain?” insisted 
Wanen. “There must be some- 
thing to account for — for — Look 
here.” He forced the words out, 
one by one. “On my way to your 
office, I looked out at the planet. 
I have never seen anything so 
beautiful in my life. I loved it as 
I ought to love only the Cadre. 
I had to run from there before 
the tears came.” He felt pain in 
his hands and unclenched them; 
the nails had bitten into the 
palms. “Something about the ex- 
perience must have changed me. 
I’m deviant.” 

“See here,” said Horlam pa- 
tiently, “it’s my specialty, not 
yours, to know what memory is. 
It’s a permanent alteration of pro- 
toplasm as the result of a stimu- 
lus. The memory patterns are all 
in the brain, except for a few hab- 
its which are synaptic patterns in 
the nerves proper. Well, I’ve just 

34 



run a comparison of the Wanen 
record we have, your cylinder, 
with the Wanen record in your 
own nervous system. This is an 
absolutely objective process, a 
tracing out of electronic patterns 
of flow, resistance — it makes an 
electronic map of your entire ner- 
vous system.” 

He finished releasing the 
younger man, sat down on a cor- 
ner of his workbench and took out 
a cigar. “The difference between 
the two patterns, my friend, is in- 
significant — a few additional 
traces caused by your experiences 
since your normal personality 
was reimposed. You’ve been tell 
ing yourself an old-time ghost 
story, with lingering traces of 
your Torrek memories in iilace 
of the ghost. Now forget it. I as- 
sure you that there are no such 
traces.” 

“But then what’s making me 
have these fits?” Wanen fell him 
self almost cringing back. 

“I’m not certain,” shrugged 
Horlam. “I told you psychalvsis 
is still a half-science fumbling in 
the dark. But at least I’ve proved 
your trouble is nothing very basic 
to yourself. 

“Tentatively, my diagnosis is 
minor glandular upset. You’ve 
spent five years on an alien plan- 
et, eating its home-grown food. 
Perfectly good, nourishing food 
for a man, but there are doubtless 
subtle biochemical differences —

hormone traces, vitaminlike com- 
pounds, and so on. Your body 
adapted. Now it’s having a little 
difficulty readapting to ship ra- 
tions. The slight chemical im- 
balance is expressing itself as ir- 
rational surges of emotion.” 

V|^ANEN nodded. His tension 
began to ease. Chemical neu- 
roses were not unheard of in this 
service, and easily correctible. “If 
I’m hot actually deviating toward 
non-loyalty — ” 

“Not enough to matter,” 
drawled Horlam. “These glandu- 
lar-digestive hooraws do some- 
times express themselves queerly. 
For instance, this desire to kill 
Lieutenant Smit that you men- 
tioned, or your feeling toward 
Ring the attitudes appropriate 
only to the Cadre. And — let’s see, 
have you had dreams the last 
night or two?” 

Wanen shuddered. “Nightmares. 
I saw my own crewmates being 
killed — atrociously.” 

“An obvious expression of re- 
sentment toward them — toward 
the entire Hegemony culture,” 
said Horlam casually. When 
Wanen jerked, half leaping to his 
feet, the psychologist laughed. 
“Take it easy there, son. You’re 
not non-loyal and nobody is going 
to shoot you. It happens all the 
time and doesn’t mean a thing.” 

He got his cigar going. “After 
all, Man evolved as a creature of 



forests and open air and — inti- 
macy, shall we say? A family ani- 
mal. Our civilization forbids all 
this, locks us indoors with ma- 
chines, selects our mates for us, 
whom we seldom see, and takes 
our children away to raise in 
creches. Naturally our instincts 
revolt. The good unit will not 
deny that he has bestial instincts' 
— rather, he will accept the fact 
and use his strength to overcome 
them.” 

Wanen found the slow voice re- 
laxing. He even began to feel 
warm. “I see,” he answered. 
“Thank you. What treatment do 
you plan?” 

“None, unless your symptoms 
get worse. And I expect they’ll 
improve by themselves. Now 
you’re dismissed. The exec wants 
you to report to him for special 
assignment.” 

T T WAS curious, the thick 
pounding of his heart as he 
walked toward the door. The aus- 
terity of the ship, blank hallways 
and neat little cubicles, eternal 
white glare of fluorescents, gave 
the mind nothing to seize. It was 
thrown back on its own sick fan- 
tasies. 

Wanen rehearsed his orders — 
any escape from the chaos and 
the sullen feeling of rebellion that 
lay coiled in his skull. The trou- 
ble was, his orders were so indefi- 
nite. In Astro, you were neces-

sarily encouraged to think for 
yourself to some extent. Even an 
enlisted man was no use on a 
spaceship if the critical faculties 
were electrically burned out of 
his brain, as was done for the 
lower ranks of civilians in child- 
hood. But this was too much lati- 
tude for a plain lieutenant of 
Boats. What was he supposed to 
do? 

“This young woman who was 
picked up with you. She was the 
first of a series of prisoners we 
intend to take, to furnish more 
detailed information about the 
country. But she’s proven too sav- 
age, even dangerous, to be of help. 
All that’s been accomplished is to 
teach her the Cadric language by 
psychalysis, under accelerine. 
What information we have about 
her people suggests that none we 
might capture is likely to be of 
much greater value to us. How- 
ever, since she was accompanying 
you. Lieutenant, she may be more 
cooperative if she is left alone 
with you. Persuade her to assist 
us. 

“Our ground-fighting forces are 
not so large nor so well equipped 
that we could easily hold an 
island against the determined 
opposition of the archipelago 
nations — especially since devia- 
tionism is anticipated among the 
garrison, which may culminate in 
open mutiny if there is a strong 
enemy to whom the mutineers 

36 



could desert afterward. Therefore 
it will be necessary, if we are to 
occupy even one island, that we 
exterminate all natives through- 
out the archipelago. The informa- 
tion she can furnish would be of 
value in conducting Such an oper- 
ation efficiently.” 

“The Intelligence men — did 
they try coercion, sir?” 

“On the woman? Of course. 
She stood nerve-pulsing till she 
fainted, so that’s no help. The so- 
called truth drugs disorganize the 
mind too much; we need syste- 
matic information. We could try 
mutilation, or the threat of it, but 
I doubt if it would work either; 
her culture seems to set a high 
value on intransigence. Either 
you persuade her. Lieutenant, or 
we discard her completely and 
fish for other prisoners.” 

“Yes, sir. But if it is permitted 
me to ask, why should we attack 
the Islands at all? There must be 
more backward areas, even desert 
regions, which could more easily 
be occupied.” 

“No doubt. But it so happens 
that the Islands are the only part 
of Ring which have been studied 
in any detail. That is because the 
ethnic officers were naturally 
most interested in the planet’s 
most advanced culture. Now we 
do not have enough ethnic or car- 
tographic specialists left to map 
any other region soon enough.” 

“I see. Thank you, sir.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Service to the Cadre! Dis- 
missed.” 

“Service to the Cadre!” 

V|^ANEN halted at the door. 

He was, he realized with a 
cold shock, afraid of what lay be- 
yond. 

Then, mumbling a curse, he 
palmed the lock. It opened for 
his prints and he went through. 
The door clashed shut behind 
him. 

She sprang from her bunk and 
stood for a moment without stir- 
ring, as if frozen. And yet, he 
thought dizzily, the lines of her 
were fleetness itself. He had never 
in all his memory seen so wild 
and lovely a creature as the one 
which poised in the steel bareness 
of this little cell. 

(Yes, he had — as Torrek. But 
Torrek had been peeled from 
him, like a skin taken off living 
flesh. ) 

She wept and ran to his arms. 

As he held her, he felt again 
the sensation which had risen in 
him when Ring swam across the 
stars. Only it was a deeper thing 
this time, a knife twisting inside 
him and a summer’s breeze in his 
hair, trumpeted victory and a 
long blue twilight where they two 
walked alone. Almost, he carried 
her to the bunk — 

But only almost. 

He remembered in barest time 
that there was a spyscope mount- 



ed somewhere. It brought him 
back to a sense of his duty, but 
with the heaviness of a world op- 
pressing him. 

She babbled endearments in a 
language he did not know, until 
at last he put a hand under her 
chin and tilted her face up to- 
ward his (where had he learned 
the gesture?) and said with an 
overwhelming tenderness: “Speak 
Cadric. I have forgotten.” 

“Oh — ” She drew a little away 
from him. His arms would not re- 
lease her, not entirely, but he saw 
terror in her eyes. 

“It’s all right,” he said. “It’s 
only that I have forgotten what 
happened on — in the Islands. You 
see, I have been returned to my 
people.” 

“Your people!” She said it 
slowly. The unfamiliar language 
was stiff on her lips. 

“Yes.” He let her go and stared 
at the floor, feeling obscurely 
ashamed. She did not run from 
him, but there was no place to 
run to. He plowed ahead: “I re- 
gret any inconveniences you may 
have suffered, but it was neces- 
sary. We’ve come for the good of 
all mankind.” 

“It — may be.” She eased a 
trifle and whispered: “But you 
have forgotten everything indeed, 
Torrek. They have shorn your 
mind like your hair?” 

“I don’t even know your name 
any more,” he said wryly. 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



37 



“Even — I am Sonna, Baelg’s 
daughter.” A slow flush crossed 
her cheeks. “We were going into 
the mountains together.” 

tTE REMEMBERED acutely 
that he had not yet been is- 
sued his Antisex tablets. But it 
was hard to define his feelings to- 
ward the girl. She was more than 
a means of relieving tension; 
more, even, than a co-procreator 
of loyal units. 

Surely his trouble went deeper 
than Horlam admitted! 

“Don’t you remember how you 
killed the kraka?” she asked him 
wonderingly. Her fists drew to- 
gether. “It was unfair to take that 
from you!” 

“It’s all right,” he said. “After 
all, I have regained so much more. 
I remember my — well, my first 
indoctrination, instead of — oh, 
say, my first fishing trip — Never 
mind! You simply wouldn’t 
understand.” 

‘What is your name now?” she 
asked. 

“Korul Wanen.” 

“I shall always think of you as 
Torrek.” She sat down on the 
bunk, smiling unhappily. “Come, 
join me, at least, and tell me 
about your people.” 

He did. It was mostly an as- 
tronomy lesson, with a sketch of 
history since the Empire died and 
a lecture on the New Empire of 
the future. He spoke in a most 

38 



dry, uninspired tone and looked 
straight before him. 

“Yes,” she said finally, “it is a 
glorious vision, to make all men 
brothers again. I think Dumeth- 
din will be pleased to make an 
alliance with you.” 

“An alliance?” he stumbled. 
“That’s not just what — what we 
had in mind.” 

“No? What then?” 

Being trained only to guide 
spaceships, and in combat to op- 
erate one of the small boats 
which guarded a major formation, 
Wanen proceeded to tell her. 

She grew altogether still. 

“It is, of course, for the best,” 
he said. 

She stood up. “Get out. 

“What? But I was explain- 
ing 

“I know I cannot kill you. But 
get out before I dirty my hands 
by trying!” 

“See here — your own self-in- 
terest — loyalty to the Cadre is 
expected of all humans — ” 

She did something then which 
told him how alien her homeland 
was and he himself had been. She 
sat down, cross-legged, and ig- 
nored him. She erased him from 
her private universe of percep- 
tions. He realized only slowly 
what she was doing; afterward, he 
wondered why he understood at 
all. He had never heard of such 
a thing before, except in his can- 
celed Torrek incarnation. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But when it penetrated his 
mind, he turned and ran from 
her, shaking with fear. 

OU have been an idiot,” 
said Coan Smit. They sat 
alone in the wardroom, after com- 
ing off Boats watch once again. 

“How was I to know?” asked 
Wanen miserably. He stared at 
his cup without really seeing it. 
“Diplomacy isn’t my field. I’m 
not an ethnic man, for Cadre’s 
sake! The exec himself said he 
could not reprimand me.” 

“I can. An Academy man isn’t 
some stupid civilian — we’re not 
only allowed versatility, it’s ex- 
pected of us. You’ve let down the 
Academy, Wanen.” 

“Shut up!” The emotion within 
Wanen exploded in a roar. “Shut 
up or I’ll wring your neck!” 

“Lieutenant!” Smit sprang 
erect. “Your behavior is deviant.” 
“For your information,” said 
Wanen between his teeth, “my 
rank is equal to yours. I’m going 
to file a criticism of your lan- 
guage.” 

“And I am going to file a sus- 
picion of deviationism,” Smit re- 
torted. “Horlam is another idiot. 
He should have turned you inside 
out. Just because your trouble 
isn’t due to lingering memory 
traces doesn’t prove that you 
have no trouble.” 

“I am also physiologically and 
biochemically checked out,” 



snapped Wanen. “Any imbalance 
is a question of micro quantities. 
When were you last investigated? 
And what business is it of yours, 
anyway?” 

“ ‘Anyone’s business is every- 
one’s business.’ ” 

Wanen had heard the slogan 
often enough. He had cited it him- 
self now and then, in a past which 
seemed impossibly remote. But 
all at once it tasted like brass in 
his mouth. He hunched over his 
coffee cup, smoldering. 

“We’re too far from home,” said 
Smit, more gently. “If we don’t 
return, it may be centuries before 
a Hegemony ship comes this way 
again. An enemy scout may find 
Ring meanwhile. Anything might 
happen. Better to dispose of you 
on suspicion than risk our entire 
operation.” 

“Yes,” said Wanen automati- 
cally. “That’s the obvious solu- 
tion.” 

“Not that I really think that’ll 
be necessary.” Smit was fairly be- 
dewed with good-fellowship now. 
He came around the table and 
laid a brotherly hand on the other 
man’s shoulder. “Actually, I my- 
self believe your trouble is just 
some trivial thing. A few shots of 
hormone, perhaps some condition- 
ing, and you should be as good as 
new. Or — wait. Now that I come 
to think of it, you’ve gone a full 
seven years without tension re- 
lease!” 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



39 



“I was on Ring,” mumbled 
Wanen. “I was a man of — what 
did she call it? — a man of Du- 
methdin. We didn’t need to do 
such things.” 

“No doubt. But now you’ve for- 
gotten. Hm.” Smit paused. 

Looking up, Wanen saw him 
thoughtfully rubbing his chin and 
realized with an illogical resent- 
ment that the fellow was trying to 
be helpful. 

“I have an idea,” Smit went on. 
“It’ll have to be approved, of 
course, but I don’t see why it 
shouldn’t be. And if all you need 
is release, this will certainly pro- 
vide it.” 

“What will?” 

“This girl, the one we captured. 
Since she just won’t cooperate 
and a total reconditioning isn’t 
worthwhile, I understand that 
she’ll be lobotomized and turned 
over to the enlisted men for a few 
days. Now if you were allowed to 
watch the operation and then 
have her first and throw her out 
of the airlock yourself when she’s 
no use any more — why, it should 
be as good as a six months’ fur- 
lough!” 

Wanen sat very still. After Smit 
had gone out, he remained in his 
position, crouched over the ward- 
room table. His heartbeat had 
slowed so much that he could no 
longer feel or hear it. Once, 
vaguely and indifferently, he 
wondered if he were dead. 

40 



Then he realized that he was 
insane. 

^|''HE Boats watch was changed 
every four hours, with the 
same men taking it every fourth 
time around. Between such duties, 
one ate, slept, studied, partici- 
pated in loyalty demonstrations 
— but there was also a certain 
amount of time to oneself, at 
least on the officer level. The 
young men played ball in the 
gym, or gambled in the ward- 
room, or perhaps they sat and 
talked. 

At any rate, there would be 
nothing suspicious about an off- 
duty lieutenant walking through 
almost any part of the ship. 

Wanen was counting on that. 
There was a curious peace within 
him. .He knew he was mad. In 
view of Horlam’s exhaustive tests 
and their uniformly negative re- 
sults, it was the only possible ex- 
planation. The strain of changing 
personalities clearly had cracked 
his mind open. He was crazy, and 
he expected to be killed some- 
where along the way, and it didn’t 
matter greatly. Nevertheless, he 
took no unnecessary chances. 

He forged his squadron com- 
mander’s name to a Special Or- 
ders slip and presented Lieuten- 
ant Rosnin with it when that con- 
scientious young man went on 
Boats watch. 

“Full combat lading for Seven- 

6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



teen, including fusion missiles?” 
Rosnin’s brows went up. “What’s 
going on?” 

“Classified,” said Wanen briskly. 
“Don’t you see this is a Special 
form?” 

Rosnin might have wondered 
why any junior officer should be 
entrusted with Classified orders 
and, simultaneously, present the 
directive in so casual a fashion. 
But he was not a man of great 
curiosity, nor given to annoying 
his superiors with questions. 
Wanen had remembered that 
from the outbound voyage and 
counted on it. 

“It shall be done. Service to 
the Cadre!” 

“Service to the Cadre.” 

Wanen wheeled and marched 
to the issue room, where he 
checked out a Mark IV sidearm 
with an extra clip of explosive 
bullets. Normal ship routine 
would force him to account for 
his action in about six hours, 
when a higher-up looked over the 
day’s requisitions. But Wanen 
didn’t expect to be around that 
much longer. 

He had to walk fast now, being 
already late for his appointment. 
He was depending on the fact 
that never before in all history 
had a properly conditioned unit 
gone deviant to the point of trea- 
son without first showing overt 
symptoms. He himself was at 
present considered merely to be 



tmder tension. But too fast a gait 
might attract attention. 

No matter. To entropy with it. 
Korul Wanen was already a dead 
man on leave. 

He came to sickbay and was 
passed by the armed guard. The 
damned ship swarmed with 
guards, he thought irritably — 
guards, paper work, anything that 
might keep a man too busy to 
think. 

Well- 

Frain Horlam waited, surgi- 
cally gowned, in the operating 
room. There were two husky 
meditechs to assist. 

The old man looked coldly at 
Wanen. “I never knew anybody 
to be late for tension release,” he 
said. 

“I was busy,” snapped Wanen. 
“Get on with it.” 

TT ORLAM switched on the 
sterilizers. One of the techs 
went out. He brought in Sonna, 
strapped to a wheeled cot. Her 
eyes were blank with a terror she 
could not choke off, but when she 
saw Wanen, she spat. 

“Is the spyscope turned on?” he 
asked. 

“Not to my knowledge,” said 
Horlam in an acid tone. “Every- 
one else is too busy right now. 
It’s you who needs a thrill.” 

“I only wondered.” 

“While we sterilize the sur- 
roundings— it wouldn’t do to 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



41 



have her get sick, would it? — you 
will probably enjoy explaining 
what is about to be done to 
her,” said Horlam. He did 
not look at Wanen; he washed 
his hands over and over again, 
with exaggerated care. “Also, of 
course, we must take the hair off 
her head before we open the 
skull. That should provoke an in- 
teresting reaction all by itself. 
Most primitive women are quite 
proud of their hair.” 

“Stop that,” said Wanen. 

“I’m only outlining the pleas- 
ures you have in store,” Horlam 
explained, his voice rusty. “We 
can do the operation under local 
anesthesia, so that she’ll be con- 
scious through most of it. Nat- 
urally, once she’s been made 
docile, you’ll have to wait a few 
days for her to heal up enough — ” 
He broke off. 

“Go on. Lieutenant.” One of the 
meditechs said it urgently. His 
eyes were very bright, fixed on 
the girl. “Go on, tell it to her 
like the doctor says.” 

“Well,” suggested Wanen, “both 
of you fellows come stand here 
beside her. There, that’s right.” 

Sonna stared up at him. He 
could imagine her thoughts, he 
told himself emptily. She would 
be wishing she could faint, wish- 
ing she could die, but there was 
too much life in her. Torrek must 
have had such wishes, right at the 
end, before they peeled him off 

42 



Wanen and locked him in a black 
cylinder. 

Wanen walked up behind the 
techs, laying a hand on the shoul- 
der of each. “I suppose you boys 
are getting some release, too. 

“Yes, sir.'” 

“Good.” Wanen’s hands slid up- 
ward, palming their heads. Then 
the muscles which had wrestled 
the kraka smashed their skulls to- 
gether. 

They went down like stones, 
but he kicked them deftly behind 
the ears, to make sure. Mostly his 
attention was on Horlam. He 
yanked the gun from beneath his 
coverall and turned its staring 
eye on the old man. 

“Don’t move,” he said. “Take 
it easy or I’ll kill you.” 

Horlam’s face drained of blood. 
“What are you doing?” he gasped. 

“I am going to break out of 
here. Yes, I am deviant. I am also 
non-loyal, obstructionist and ho- 
micidal. My greatest wish is to 
shoot my own dear shipmates one 
at a time. Please don’t make me 
start on you. Gently now— very 
gently — keep your hands and 
feet in plain sight. Come up here 
and let the girl go.” 

OR a minute, he thought that 
Sonna had indeed fainted. 
But when Horlam had unstrapped 
her, she wavered to her feet. 

“Torrek,” she whispered. “Tor- 
rek, elskling.’’ 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I am going to take you home, 
Sonna,” he told her. 

There was a curious expression 
on Horlam’s thin face. The shock 
had passed; mostly, now, he 
looked interested. 

“Do you really hope to get 
away with this?” he asked. 

“No,” said Wanen. 

“Hitherto, this sort of thing has 
been a clinical impossibility. By 
all objective tests, you were func- 
tioning within the limits of nor- 
mality — ” 

“Shut up. Get a surgical gown 
and mask for the girl. Help her 
put them on . Very well. Now, 
Horlam, you go first out the 
door.” 

The clumsy disguise did not 
get them past the sentry outside. 
It did slow his comprehension a 
little bit— long enough for Wanen 
to shoot him down as he grabbed 
for his rifle. 

Thereafter, they ran. 

Twice it was necessary to kill 
men who got in the way. By the 
time Wanen and Sonna had 
reached Boat Seventeen, the 
whole ship was one great clamor 
of sirens and shouts and hurrying 
feet. 

His explosive bullets mopped 
up the guard by the launching ro- 
bot. But as he was setting it to 
eject the boat, he saw Coan Smit 
burst from a side passage. Wanen 
fired once and missed. Then Smit 
made a dive, tackled him by the 



ankles, and his gun went flying. 

“Go through that door, Sonna!” 
Wanen ordered. 

Smit’s hands groped after his 
vulnerable spots, in the standard 
Academy in-fighting technique. 
Wanen blocked him with the 
same automatic procedure. But 
then, somehow, Wanen’s arms and 
legs were going through motions 
unknown to any civilized folk. He 
broke Smit’s back across his knee. 

A spatter of bullets rang down 
the hall. Wanen got up, threw the 
launcher lock switch open and 
followed Sonna. 

The boat’s combat-ready mo- 
tors roared as he shoved up the 
main bar. He vaulted into the 
pilot chair and grabbed for the 
controls. Sonna crouched behind 
him, cramped, bruised, and 
screaming a call that was some- 
how familiar to him. 

T>OAT Seventeen leaped from 
the mother ship and hurled 
starlight back from her flanks. 

“They’ll hunt us down — ” It 
was an unexpected groan in 
Wanen’s ears. 

“No, they won’t!” he said 
roughly. “I thought of that, too.” 

He slammed a lever. The fu- 
sion missiles leaped from their 
tubes. 

“Cover your eyes!” he shouted, 
and accelerated brutally to es- 
cape. 

When the soundless explosion 



A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK 



43 



was over, only an incandescent 
gas cloud remained. It glowed for 
a moment, unbearably bright, be- 
fore it expanded and cooled. 
Darkness gulped it down. 

Wanen pointed his boat toward 
the beautiful ringed planet. 

He began to weep. 

Sonna reached across the nar- 
row cockpit. There was alarm 
in the gesture. Horlam stopped 
her. 

“No,” he said gently. “Let him 
get it out. He’s just denied his en- 
tire lifetime.” 

She sank back. Through the 
transparent canopy, the swelling 
lambent planet tangled its many- 
colored luminance in her hair. 

“Why are you here, old man?” 
she breathed. “You could have 
dropped behind easily enough as 
we fled. You did not know he 
meant to destroy the ship.” 

“I might have guessed,” said 
Horlam dryly. “Or — let us say 
that I have been a trifle devia- 
tionist myself for a good many 
years, and when the opportunity 
came— It was my task to detect 
emerging humanness in men and 
uproot it. But there is a very an- 
cient saying which asks. Who 
shall watch the watchmen?” 

Ever so faintly, Sonna’s fingers 
brushed the blond head which lay 
shuddering before her. “Has Tor- 
rek come back?” 

“Not in the way you hope,” said 
Horlam. “The open, overt memo- 



ries of Torrek — the deeds done, 
words spoken, things seen — I’m 
afraid they went forever with the 
ship. But there is another kind of 
memory. Our theories don’t allow 
for it — but then Hegemony sci- 
ence is almost as narrow and me- 
chanical as Hegemony life. You 
can’t, after all, separate the brain 
and nerves from the rest of the 
body: from muscles, veins, vis- 
cera, skin, blood and lungs and 
bones. The living organism is a 
wholeness. 

“Apparently your way of life, 
down there in the Islands, is a 
biologically sound one. It suits 
Man’s deepest instincts, as ours 
does not. Therefore, five years of 
it made a deeper impression on 
our boy here than the twenty-odd 
years of slogans and exercises be- 
fore that. When we brought him 
back, the psychalyzer wiped out 
the memories, yes. I even thought 
it had removed the habits. 

“But it didn’t touch the true 
habits— those deep reactions, per- 
haps on an actual cellular level, 
which we call emotional patterns. 
Wanen could forget that he had 
been an Islander. He could not 
forget what it meant to be an 
Islander — pride, freedom, decen- 
cy — whatever it does mean. His 
body remembered that for him!” 

H orlam smiled. “I was not 
without slight suspicions of 
this,” he finished, “but I was al- 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ready deviationist enough not to 
report it. I was curious to see 
what would develop. Now I know 
and I’m not sorry.” 

The girl leaned over the seat 
and rubbed her cheek against 
Wanen’s. He lifted his head and 
wiped his eyes, pathetically like 
a child. 

“What are we going to do 
now?” she asked. 

“Return to your country — our 
country,” Wanen said with a gath- 
ering strength. “Warn them. We 
have a long time yet to make 
ourselves ready, invent our own 



science and build our own ships 
and hnd our own allies among the 
stars — my knowledge and Hor- 
lam’s will help with the first be- 
ginnings, but it will take many 
lifetimes to finish. It’s a good 
work for a man.” 

“Oh, Torrek, my poor hurt Tor- 
rek — everything you have forgot- 
ten!” 

“I remembered* what was im- 
portant, didn’t I?” He twisted 
around to face her. “The rest I 
can learn over again. Will you 
teach me?”

If you want to learn why editors grow jumpy — some editors, that is; 
the ones who have to make deadlines and want the very best material that 
can be extracted from authors — consider this: 

Next month's novella, TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP by William Tenn, was 
supposed to have been turned in nearly a year ago! But Tenn, unlike infinitely 
less capable writers, won't let a story out of his hands until he has added, 
changed, rewritten, deleted, tensely played down and equally tensely played 
up scenes — and rammed in enough richness of ideas, characters and suspense 
to carry a trilogy! However nervous the wait is, it's worth every agonized 
moment. 

In TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP, just to give you a bare-bone notion of 
the immense amount of tight-packed story awaiting you, Tenn reveals the 
most obstinate man in five full centuries . and then wins your full sympa- 
thy for the stubborn human mule. But regardless of its making all the sense 
in the world, Winthrop's obstinacy means tragedy for four sufferers in a soci- 
ety they never made and want^no part of! How can it possibly be resolved? 
Leave it to Tenn to solve the unsolvable. 

Because of its length — complete in one issue — there's no telling how 
many novelets can also be run. There will be at least one, maybe two, plus, 
of course, short stories and .

4 Wind is Rising 



By FINN O'DONNEVAN 



O UTSIDE, a wind was ris- 
ing. But within the sta- 
tion, the two men had 
other things on their minds. Clay- 
ton turned the handle of the 
water faucet again and waited. 
Nothing happened. 

“Try hitting it,” said Nerishev. 
Clayton pounded the faucet 
with his fist. Two drops of water 
came out. A third drop trembled 
on the spigot’s lip, swayed, and 
fell. That was all. 

“That does it,” Clayton said bit-

terly. “That damned water pipe is 
blocked again. How much water 
we got in storage?” 

“Four gallons — assuming the 
tank hasn’t sprung another leak,” 
said Nerishev. He stared at the 
faucet, tapping it with long, ner- 
vous fingers. He was a big, pale 
man with a sparse beard, fragile- 
looking in spite of his size. He 
didn’t look like the type to oper- 
ate an observation station on a re- 
mote and alien planet. But the 
Advance Exploration Corps had

discovered, to its regret, that there 
was no type to operate a station. 

Nerishev was a competent bi- 
ologist and botanist. Although 
chronically nervous, he had sur- 
prising reserves of calm. He was 
the sort of man who needs an oc- 
casion to rise to. This, if anything, 
made him suitable to pioneer a 
planet like Carella I. 

“I suppose somebody should go 
out and unblock the water pipe,” 
said Nerishev, not looking at 
Clayton. 

“I suppose so,” Clayton said, 
pounding the faucet again. “But 
it’s going to be murder out there. 
Listen to it!” 

Clayton was a short man, bull- 
necked, red-faced, powerfully con- 
structed. This was his third tour 
of duty as a planetary observer. 

He had tried other jobs in the 
Advance Exploration Corps, but 
none suited him. PEP — Primary 
Extraterrestrial Penetration — 
faced him with too many unpleas- 
ant surprises. It was work for 
daredevils and madmen. But Base 
Operations was much too tame 
and restricting. 

He liked the work of a plane- 
tary observer, though. His job was 
to sit tight on a planet newly 
opened by the PEP boys and 
checked out by a drone camera 
crew. All he had to do on this 
planet was stoically endure dis- 
comfort and skillfully keep him- 
self alive. After a year of this, the 



relief ship would remove him and 
note his report. On the basis of 
the report, further action would 
or would not be taken. 

"DEFORE each tour of duty, 
Clayton dutifully promised 
his wife that this would be the 
last. After this tour, he was going 
to stay on Earth and work on the 
little farm he owned. He prom- 
ised . 

But at the end of each rest 
leave, Clayton journeyed out 
again, to do the thing for which 
he was best suited: staying alive 
through skill and endurance. 

But this time, he had had it 
He and Nerishev had been eight 
months on Carella. The relief 
ship was due in another four 
months. If he came through alive, 
he was going to quit for good. 

“Just listen to that wind,” Neri- 
shev said. 

Muffled, distant, it sighed and 
murmured around the steel hull 
of the station like a zephyr, a 
summer breeze. 

That was how it sounded to 
them inside the station, separated 
from the wind by three inches of 
steel plus a soundproofing layer. 

“It’s rising,” Clayton said. He 
walked over to the windspeed in- 
dicator. According to the dial, the 
gentle-sounding wind was blowing 
at a steady 82 miles an hour — 

A light breeze on Carella. 

“Man, oh, man!” Clayton said. 



A WIND IS RISING

“I don’t want to go out there. 
Nothing’s worth going out there.” 

“It’s your turn,” Nerishev 
pointed out. 

“I know. Let me complain a 
little first, will you? Come on, let’s 
get a forecast from Smanik.” 

They walked the length of the 
station, their heels echoing on the 
steel floor, past compartments 
filled with food, air supplies, in- 
struments, extra equipment. At 
the far end of the station was the 
heavy metal door of the receiving 
shed. The men slipped on air 
masks and adjusted the flow. 

“Ready?” Clayton asked. 

“Ready.” 

They braced themselves, grip- 
ping handholds beside the door. 
Clayton touched the stud. The 
door slid away and a gust of wind 
shrieked in. The men lowered 
their heads and butted into the 
wind, entering the receiving shed. 

The shed was an extension of 
the station, some thirty feet long 
by fifteen feet wide. It was not 
sealed, like the rest of the struc- 
ture. The walls were built of 
open-work steel, with baffles set 
in. The wind could pass through 
this arrangement, but slowed 
down, controlled. A gauge told 
them it was blowing 34 miles an 
hour within the shed. 

It was a damned nuisance, 
Clayton thought, having to confer 
with the natives of Carella in a 
34-mile gale. But there was no 

48 



other way. The Carellans, raised 
on a planet where the wind never 
blew less than 70 miles an hour, 
couldn’t stand the “dead air” 
within the station. Even with the 
oxygen content cut down to the 
Carellan norm, the natives 
couldn’t make the adjustment. 
Within the station, they grew 
dizzy and apprehensive. Soon 
they began strangling, like a man 
in a vacuum. 

Thirty-four miles an hour of 
wind was a fair compromise-point 
for human and Carellan to meet. 

I^LAYTON and Nerishev 
^ walked down the shed. In 
one corner lay what looked like a 
tangle of dried-out octopi. The 
tangle stirred and waved two ten- 
tacles ceremoniously. 

“Good day,” said Smanik. 

“Good day,” Clayton said. 
“What do you think of the 
weather?” 

“Excellent,” said Smanik. 

Nerishev tugged at Clayton’s 
sleeve. “What did he say?” he 
asked, and nodded thoughtfully 
when Clayton translated it for 
him. Nerishev lacked Clayton’s 
gift for language. Even after eight 
months, the Carellan tongue was 
still an undecipherable series of 
clicks and whistles to him. 

Several more Carellans came 
up to join the conversation. They 
all looked like spiders or octopi, 
with their small centralized body 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and long, flexible tentacles. This 
was the optimum survival shape 
on Carella, and Clayton frequent- 
ly envied it. He was forced to 
rely absolutely on the shelter of 
the station; but the Carellans 
lived directly in their environ- 
ment. 

Often he had seen a native 
walking against a tornado-force 
wind, seven or eight limbs hooked 
into the ground and pulling, other 
tentacles reaching out for further 
grips. He had seen them rolling 
down the wind like tumbleweed, 
their tentacles curled around 
them, wickerwork-basket fashion. 
He thought of the gay and auda- 
cious way they handled their land 
ships, scudding merrily along on 
the wind . 

Well, he thought, they’d look 
damned silly on Earth. 

“What is the weather going to 
be like?” he asked Smanik. 

The Carellan pondered the 
question for a while, sniffed the 
wind and rubbed two tentacles 
together. 

“The wind may rise a shade 
more,” he said finally. “But it will 
be nothing serious.” 

Clayton wondered. Nothing se- 
rious for a Carellan could mean 
disaster for an Earthman. Still, it 
sounded fairly promising. 

He and Nerishev left the re- 
ceiving shed and closed the door. 

“Look,” said Nerishev, “if you’d 
like to wait—” 



“Might as well get it over 
with,” Clayton said. 

Here, lighted by a single dim 
overhead bulb, was the smooth, 
glittering bulk of the Brute. That 
was the nickname they had given 
to the vehicle specially con- 
structed for transportation on 
Carella. 

The Brute was armored like a 
tank and streamlined like a 
spheric section. It had vision slits 
of shatterproof glass, thick enough 
to match the strength of its steel 
plating. Its center of gravity was 
low; most of its twelve tons were 
centered near the ground. The 
Brute was sealed. Its heavy diesel 
engine, as well as all necessary 
openings, were fitted with special 
dustproof covers. The Brute 
rested on its six fat tires, looking, 
in its immovable bulk, like some 
prehistoric monster. 

Clayton got in, put on crash 
helmet and goggles, and strapped 
himself into the padded seat. He 
revved up the engine, listened to 
it critically, then nodded. 

“Okay,” he said, “the Brute’s 
ready. Get upstairs and open the 
garage door.” 

“Good luck,” said Nerishev. He 
left. 

LAYTON went over the in- 
strument panel, making sure 
that all the Brute’s special gadg- 
ets were in working order. In a 
moment, he heard Nerishev’s 



A WIND IS RISING 



49 



voice coming in over the radio. 

“I’m opening the door.” 

“Right.” 

The heavy door slid back and 
Clayton drove the Brute outside. 

The station had been set up on 
a wide, empty plain. Mountains 
would have offered some protec- 
tion from the wind; but the moun- 
tains on Carella were in a con- 
stant restless state of building up 
and breaking down. The plain 
presented dangers of its own, 
however. To avert the worst of 
those dangers, a field of stout 
steel posts had been planted 
around the station. The closely 
packed posts pointed outward, 
like ancient tank traps, and 
served the same purpose. 

Clayton drove the Brute down 
one of the narrow, winding chan- 
nels that led through the field of 
posts. He emerged, located the 
pipeline and started along it. On 
a small screen above his head, a 
white line flashed into view. The 
line would show any break or ob- 
struction in the pipeline. 

A wide, rocky, monotonous 
desert stretched before him. An 
occasional low bush came into 
sight. The wind was directly be- 
hind him, blanketed by the sound 
of the diesel. 

He glanced at the windspeed 
indicator. The wind of Carella 
was blowing at 92 miles an hour. 

He drove steadily along, hum- 
ming to himself under his breath. 



From time to time, he heard a 
crash. Pebbles, propelled by the 
hurricane wind, were cannonading 
against the Brute. They shattered 
harmlessly against the thick 
armor. 

“Everything all right?” Neri- 
shev asked over the radio. 

“Fine,” Clayton said. 

In the distance, he saw a Carel- 
lan land ship. It was about forty 
feet long, he judged, and narrow 
in the beam, skimming rapidly on 
crude wooden rollers. The ship’s 
sails were made from one of the 
few leaf-bearing shrubs on the 
planet. 

The Carellans waved their ten- 
tacles as they went past. They 
seemed to be heading toward the 
station. 

Clayton turned his attention 
back to the pipeline. He was be- 
ginning to hear the wind now, 
above the roar of the diesel. The 
windspeed indicator showed that 
the wind had risen to 97 miles an 
hour. 

Somberly he stared through 
the sand-pocked slit-window. In 
the far distance were jagged cliffs, 
seen dimly through the dust- 
blown air. More pebbles rico- 
cheted off his hull and the sound 
rang hollowly through his ve- 
hicle. He glimpsed another Carel- 
lan land ship, then three more. 
They were tacking stubbornly 
into the wind. 

It struck Clayton that a lot of 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Carellans were moving toward the 
station. He signaled to Nerishev 
on the radio. 

“How are you doing?” Nerishev 
asked. 

“I’m close to the spring and no 
break yet,” Clayton reported. 
“Looks like a lot of Carellans 
heading your way.” 

“I know. Six ships are moored 
in the lee of the shed and more 
are coming.” 

“We’ve never had any trouble 
with the natives before,” Clayton 
said slowly. “What does this look 
like?” 

“They’ve brought food with 
them. It might be a celebration.” 

“Maybe. Watch yourself.” 

“Don’t worry. You take care 
and hurry—” 

“I’ve found the break! Speak 
to you later.” 

'T^HE break showed on the 
screen, glowing white. Peering 
out the port, Clayton saw where 
a boulder had rolled across the 
pipeline, crushing it, and rolled 
on. 

He brought the truck to a stop 
on the windward side of the pipe. 
It was blowing 113 miles an hour. 
Clayton slid out of the truck, car- 
rying several lengths of pipe, 
some patches, a blowtorch and a 
bag of tools. They were all tied 
to him and he was secured to the 
Brute by a strong nylon rope. 

Outside, the wind was deafen- 



ing. It thundered and roared like 
breaking surf. He adjusted his 
mask for more oxygen and went 
to work. 

Two hours later, he had com- 
pleted a fifteen-minute repair job. 
His clothing was shredded and 
and his air extractor was com- 
pletely clogged with dust. 

He climbed back into the 
Brute, sealed the port and lay on 
the floor, resting. The truck was 
starting to tremble in the wind 
gusts. Clayton ignored it. 

“Hello? Hello?” Nerishev called 
over the radio. 

Wearily, Clayton climbed back 
into the driver’s seat and ac- 
knowledged. 

“Hurry back now, Clayton! No 
time to rest! The wind’s up to 
138! I think a storm is coming!” 

A storm on Carella was some- 
thing Clayton didn’t even want to 
think about. They had expe- 
rienced only one in eight months. 
During it, the winds had gone 
over 160 miles an hour. 

He nosed the truck around and 
started back, driving directly into 
the wind. At full throttle, he 
found he was making very little 
progress. Three miles an hour was 
all the heavy diesel would do 
against the pressure of a 138-mile 
wind. 

He stared ahead through the 
slit-window. The wind, outlined 
by long streamers of dust and 
sand, seemed to be coming 



A WIND IS RISING

straight at him, funneled out of 
an infinitely wide sky to the tiny 
point of his window. Windborne 
rocks sailed at him, grew large, 
immense, and shattered against 
his window. He couldn’t stop him- 
self from ducking each time one 
came. 

The heavy engine was begin- 
ning to labor and miss. 

“Oh, baby,” Clayton breathed, 
“don’t quit now. Not now. Get 
Papa home. Then quit. Please!” 

He figured he was about ten 
miles from the station, which lay 
directly upwind. 

He heard a sound like an ava- 
lanche plumitieting down a moun- 
tainside. It was made by a boul- 
der the size of a house.. Too big 
for the wind to lift, it was rolling 
at him from windward, digging a 
furrow in the rocky ground as it 
came. 

Clayton twisted the steering 
wheel. The engine labored, and 
with infinite slowness the truck 
crept out of the boulder’s path. 
Shaking, Clayton watched the 
boulder bearing down. With one 
hand, he pounded on the instru- 
ment panel. 

“Move, baby, move!” 

B ooming hollowly, the boul- 
der rolled past at a good 
thirty miles an hour. 

“Too close,” Clayton said to 
himself. He tried to turn the 
Brute back into the wind, toward 



the station. The Brute wouldn’t 
do it. 

The diesel labored and whined, 
trying to turn the big truck into 
the wind. And the wind,, like a 
solid gray wall, pushed the truck 
away. 

The windspeed indicator stood 
at 159 miles an hour. 

“How are you doing?” Nerishev 
asked over the radio. 

“Just great! Leave me alone, 
I’m busy.” 

Clayton set his brakes, un- 
strapped and raced back to the 
engine. He adjusted timing and 
mixture, and hurried back to the 
controls. 

“Hey, Nerishev! That engine’s 
going to conk out!” 

It was a full second before 
Nerishev answered. Then, very 
calmly, he asked, “What’s wrong 
with it?” 

“Sand!” Clayton said. “Particles 
driven at 159 miles an hour — 
sand’s in the bearings, injectors, 
everything. I’m going to make all 
the distance I can.” 

“And then?” 

“Then I’ll try to sail her back,” 
Clayton said. “I just hope the 
mast will take it.” 

He turned his attention to the 
controls. At windspeeds like this, 
the truck had to be handled like 
a ship at sea. Clayton picked up 
speed with the wind on his quar- 
ter, then came about and slammed 
into the wind. 



A WIND IS RISING 



53 



The Brute made it this time 
and crossed over onto the other 
tack. 

It was the best he could do, 
Clayton decided. His windward 
distance would have to be made 
by tacking. He edged toward the 
eye of the wind. But at full throt- 
tle, the diesel couldn’t bring him 
much closer than forty degrees. 

For an hour, the Brute forged 
ahead, tacking back and forth 
across the wind, covering three 
miles in order to make two. Mi- 
raculously, the engine kept on 
running. Clayton blessed the 
manufacturer and begged the 
diesel to hold out a little while 
longer. 

Through a blinding screen of 
sand, he saw another Carellan 
land ship. It was reefed down and 
heeled precariously over. But it 
forged steadily to windward and 
soon outdistanced him. 

Lucky natives, Clayton thought 
— 165 miles of wind was a sailing 
breeze to them! 

The station, a gray half-sphere, 
came into sight ahead. 

“I’m going to make it!” Clayton 
shouted. “Break out the rum, 
Nerishev, old man! Papa’s getting 
drunk tonight!” 

The diesel chose that moment 
to break down for good. 

LAYTON swore violently as 
he set the brakes. What lousy 
luck! If the wind were behind 

54 



him, he could roll in. But, of 
course, it had to be in front. 

“What are you going to do 
now?” Nerishev asked. 

“I’m going to sit here,” Clayton 
said. “When the wind calms down 
to a hurricane, I’m going to walk 
home.” 

The Brute’s twelve-ton mass 
was shaking and rattling in the 
wind blasts. 

“You know,” Clayton said, “I’m 
going to retire after this tour.” 

“That so? You really mean it?” 

“Absolutely. I own a farm in 
Maryland, with frontage on Ches- 
apeake Bay. You know what I’m 
going to do?” 

“What?” 

“I’m going to raise oysters. You 
see, the oyster — Hold it.” 

The station seemed to be 
drifting slowly upwind, away 
from him. Clayton rubbed his 
eyes, wondering if he were going 
crazy. Then he realized that, in 
spite of its brakes, in spite of its 
streamlining, the truck was being 
pushed downwind, away from the 
station. 

Angrily he shoved a button on 
his switchboard, releasing the 
port and starboard anchors. He 
heard the solid clunk of the an- 
chors hitting the ground, heard 
the steel cables scrape and rattle. 
He let out a himdred and seventy 
feet of steel line, then set the 
winch brakes. The truck was 
holding again. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I dropped the anchors,” Clay- 
ton said. 

“Are they holding?” 

“So far.” Clayton lighted a ciga- 
rette and leaned back in his 
padded chair. Every muscle in his 
body ached from tension. His eye- 
lids were twitching from watching 
the wind-lines converging on him. 
He closed his eyes and tried to 
relax. 

The sound of the wind cut 
through the truck’s steel plating. 
The wind howled and moaned, 
tugging at the truck, trying to find 
a hold on the smooth surface. At 
169 miles an hour, the ventilator 
baffles blew out. He would be 
blinded, Clayton thought, if he 
weren’t wearing sealed goggles, 
choked if he weren’t breathing 
canned air. Dust swirled, thick 
and electric, within the Brute’s 
cabin. 

Pebbles, flung with the velocity 
of rifle bullets, splattered against 
the hull. They were striking 
harder now. He wondered how 
much more force they’d need be- 
fore they started piercing the 
armor plating. 

A T TIMES like this, Clayton 
found it hard to maintain a 
common-sense attitude. He was 
painfully aware of the vulnera- 
bility of human flesh, appalled at 
the possibilities for violence in the 
Universe. What was he doing out 
here? Man’s place was in the 



calm, still air of Earth. If he ever 
got back . 

“Are you all right?” Nerishev 
asked. 

“Making out just great,” Clay- 
ton said wearily. “How are things 
at the station?” 

“Not so good. The whole struc- 
ture’s starting sympathetic vibra- 
tion. Enough wind for long enough 
and the foundations could shat- 
ter.” 

“And they want to put a fuel 
station here!” Cla5d:on said. 

“Well, you know the problem. 
This is the only solid planet be- 
tween Angarsa III and the South 
Ridge Belt. All the rest are gas 
giants.” 

“They better build their station 
in space.” 

“The cost 

“Hell, man, it’ll cost less to 
build another planet than to try 
to maintain a fuel base on this 
one!” Clayton spat out a mouth- 
ful of dust. “I just want to get on 
that relief ship. How many na- 
tives at the station now?” 

“About fifteen, in the shed.” 
“Any sign of violence?” 

“No, but they’re acting funny.” 
“How so?” 

“I don’t know,” said Nerishev. 
“I just don’t like it.” 

“Stay out of the shed, huh? 
You can’t speak the language, 
anyhow, and I want you in one 
piece when I come back.” He 
hesitated. “If I come back.” 



A WIND IS RISING 



55 



“You’ll be fine,” Nerishev said. 

“Sure I will. I — oh, Lord!” 

“Whafs it? Whafs wrong?” 

“Boulder coming down! Talk to 
you later!” 

Clayton turned his attention to 
the boulder, a rapidly growing 
black speck to windward. It was 
heading directly toward his an- 
chored and immobilized truck. 
He glanced at the windspeed in- 
dicator. Imjjossible — 174 miles 
an hour! And yet, he reminded 
himself, winds in the stratospheric 
jet stream on Earth blow at 200 
miles an hour. 

The boulder, large as a house, 
still growing as it approached, 
was rolling directly his way. 

“Swerve! Turn!” Clayton bel- 
lowed at the boulder, pounding 
the instrument panel with his fist. 

The boulder was coming at 
him, straight as a ruler line, roll- 
ing right down the wind. 

With a yell of agony, Clayton 
touched a button, releasing both 
anchors at the cable end. There 
was no time to winch them in, 
even assuming the winch could 
take the strain. Still the boulder 
grew. 

Clayton released his brakes. 

The Brute, shoved by a wind 
of 178 miles an hour, began to 
pick up speed. Within seconds, he 
was traveling at 38 miles an hour, 
staring through his rear-vision 
mirror at the boulder overtaking 
him. 



A S THE boulder rolled up, 
Clayton twisted the steering 
wheel hard to the left. The truck 
tilted over precariously, swerved, 
fishtailed on the hard ground, 
and tried to turn itself over. He 
fought the wheel, trying to bring 
the Brute back to equilibrium. He 
thought: Fm probably the first 
man who ever jibed a twelve-ton 
truck! 

The boulder, looking like a 
whole city block, roared past. The 
heavy truck teetered for a mo- 
ment, then came to rest on its six 
wheels. 

“Clayton! What happened? Are 
you all right?” 

“Fine,” Clayton gasped. “But I 
had to slip the cables. I’m run- 
ning downwind.” 

“Can you turn?” 

“Almost knocked her over, try- 
ing to.” 

“How far can you run?” 
Clayton stared ahead. In the 
distance, he could make out the 
dramatic black cliffs that rimmed 
the plain. 

“I got about fifteen miles to go 
before I pile into the cliffs. Not 
much time, at the speed I’m trav- 
eling.” He locked his brakes. The 
tires began to scream and the 
brake linings smoked furiously. 
But the wind, at 183 miles an 
hour, didn’t even notice the dif- 
ference. His speed over the 
ground had picked up to 44 miles 
an hour.

“Try sailing her out!” Nerishev 
said. 

“She won’t take it.” 

“Try, man! What else can you 
do? The wind’s hit 185 here. The 
whole station’s shaking! Boulders 
are tearing up the whole post de- 
fense. I’m afraid some boulders 
are going to get through and flat-

mayingly went dead. 

Clayton banged it a few times, 
then gave up. His speed over the 
ground had reached 49 miles an 
hour. The cliffs were already 
looming large before him. 

“So all right,” Clayton said. 
“Here we go.” He released his last 
anchor, a small emergency job. At 
its full length of 250 feet of steel 
cable, it slowed him to 30 miles 
an hour. The anchor was breaking 
and ripping through the ground 
like a jet-propelled plow. 

Clayton then turned on the sail 
mechanism. This had been in- 
stalled by the Earth engineers 
upon much the same theory that 
has small ocean-going motor boats 
carry a small mast and auxiliary 
sail. The sails are insurance, in 
case the engine fails. On Carella, 
a man could never walk home 
from a stranded vehicle. He had 



to come in under power. 

The mast, a short, powerful 
steel pillar, extruded itself through 
a gasketed hole in the roof. Mag- 
netic shrouds and stays snapped 
into place, supporting it. From the 
mast fluttered a sail made of link- 
woven metal. For a mainsheet, 
Clasrton had a three part flexible- 
steel cable, working through a 
winch. 

The sail was only a few square 
feet in area. It could drive a 
twelve-ton monster with its brakes 
locked and an anchor out on 250 
feet of line — 

Easily — with the wind blowing 
185 miles an hour. 

^LAYTON winched in the 
^ mainsheet and turned, taking 
the wind on the quarter. But a 
quartering course wasn’t good 
enough. He winched the sail in 
still more and turned further into 
the wind. 

With the super-hurricane on his 
beam, the ponderous truck heeled 
over, lifting one entire side into 
the air. Quickly Clayton released 
a few feet of mainsheet. The met- 
al-link sail screamed and chat- 
tered as the wind whipped it. 

Driving now with just the sail’s 
leading edge, Clayton was able to 
keep the truck on its feet and 
make good a course to windward. 

Through the rear-vision mirror, 
he could see the black, jagged 
cliffs behind him. They were his

lee shore, his coast of wrecks. But 
he was sailing out of the trap. 
Foot by foot, he was pulling away. 

“That’s my baby!” Clayton 
shouted to the battling Brute. 

His sense of victory snapped 
almost at once, for he heard an 
ear-splitting clang and something 
whizzed past his head. At 187 
miles an hour, pebbles were pierc- 
ing his armor plating. He was un- 
dergoing the Carellan equivalent 
of a machine-gun barrage. The 
wind shrieked through the holes, 
trying to batter him out of his 
seat. 

Desperately he clung to the 
steering wheel. He could hear the 
sail wrenching. It was made out 
of the toughest flexible alloys 
available, but it wasn’t going to 
hold up for long. The short, thick 
mast, supported by six heavy 
cables, was whipping like a fish- 
ing rod. 

His brake linings were worn 
out, and his speed over the 
ground came up to 57 miles an 
hour. 

He was too tired to think. He 
steered, his hands locked to the 
wheel, his slitted eyes glaring 
ahead into the storm. 

The sail ripped with a scream. 
The tatters flogged for a moment, 
then brought the mast down. 
Wind gusts were approaching 190 
miles an hour. 

The wind now was driving him 
back toward the cliffs. At 192 

58 



miles an hour of wind, the Brute 
was lifted bodily, thrown for a 
dozen yards, slammed back on its 
wheels. A front tire blew under 
the pressure, then two rear ones. 
Clayton put his head on his arms 
and waited for the end. 

Suddenly, the Brute stopped 
short. Clayton was flung forward. 
His safety belt checked him for 
a moment, then snapped. He 
banged against the instrument 
panel and fell back, dazed and 
bleeding. 

TTE LAY on the floor, half con- 
scious, trying to figure out 
what had happened. Slowly he 
pulled himself back into the seat, 
foggily aware that he hadn’t 
broken any limbs. His stomach 
was one great bruise. His mouth 
was bleeding. 

At last, looking through the 
rear-vision mirror, he saw what 
had happened. The emergency 
anchor, trailing at 250 feet of 
steel cable, had caught in a deep 
outcropping of rock. A fouled an- 
chor had brought him up short, 
less than half a mile from the 
cliffs. He was saved — 

For the moment, at least. 

But the wind hadn’t given up 
yet. The 193-mile-an-hour wind 
bellowed, lifted the truck bodily, 
slammed it down, lifted it again, 
slammed it down. The steel cable 
hummed like a guitar string. Clay- 
ton wrapped his arms and legs 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



around the seat. He couldn’t hold 
on much longer. And if he let go, 
the madly leaping Brute would 
smear him over the walls like 
toothpaste — 

If the cable didn’t part first and 
send him hurtling into the cliffs. 

He held on. At the top of one 
swing, he caught a glimpse of the 
windspeed indicator. The sight of 
it sickened him. He was through, 
finished, done for. How could he 
be expected to hold on through 
the force of a 187-mile-an-hour 
wind? It was too much. 

It was — 187 miles an hour? 
That meant that the wind was 
dropping! 

He could hardly believe it at 
first. But slowly, steadily, the dial 
hand crept down. At 160 miles an 
hour, the truck stopped slamming 
and lay passively at the end of its 
anchor line. At 153, the wind 
veered — a sure sign that the blow 
was nearly over. 

When it had dropped to 142 
miles an hour, Clayton allowed 
himself the luxury of passing out. 

^ ARELLAN natives came out 
^ for him later in the day. 
Skillfully they maneuvered two 
big land ships up to the Brute, 
fastened on their long vines — 
which tested out stronger than 
steel — and towed the derelict 
truck back to the station. 

They brought him into the re- 
ceiving shed and Nerishev carried 



him into the station’s dead air. 

“You didn’t break anything ex- 
cept a couple of teeth,” said Neri- 
shev. “But there isn’t an un- 
bruised inch on you.” 

“We came through it,” Clasdon 
said. 

“Just. Our boulder defense is 
completely flattened. The station 
took two direct hits from boulders 
and barely contained them. I’ve 
checked the foundations; they’re 
badly strained. Another blow like 
that — ” 

“—and we’d make out some- 
how. Us Earth lads, we come 
through! That was the worst in 
eight months. Four months more 
and the relief ship comes! Buck 
up, Nerishev. Come with me.” 

“Where are we going?” 

“I want to talk to that damned 
Smanik!” 

They came into the shed. It 
was filled to overflowing with 
Carellans. Outside, in the lee of 
the station, several dozen land 
ships were moored. 

“Smanik!” Clayton called. 
“What’s going on here?” 

“It is the Festival of Summer,” 
Smanik said. “Our great yearly 
holiday.” 

“Hm. What about that blow? 
What did you think of it?” 

“I would classify it as a moder- 
ate gale,” said Smanik. “Nothing 
dangerous, but somewhat unpleas- 
ant for sailing.” 

“Unpleasant! I hope you get 



A WIND IS RISING 



59 



your forecasts a little more accu- 
rate in the future.” 

“One cannot always outguess 
the weather,” Smanik said. “It is 
regrettable that my last forecast 
should be wrong.” 

“Your Iasi? How come? What’s 
the matter?” 

“These people,” Smanik said, 
gesturing around him, “are my en- 
tire tribe, the Seremai. We have 
celebrated the Festival of Sum- 
mer. Now summer is ended and 
we must go away.” 

‘Where to?” 

“To the caverns in the far west. 
They are two weeks’ sail from 
here. We will go into the caverns 
and live there for three months. 
In that way, we will find safety.” 
Clayton had a sudden sinking 
feeling in his stomach. “Safety 
from what, Smanik?” 

“I told you. Summer is over. We 
need safety now from the winds — 
the powerful storm winds of win- 
ter.” 

‘What is it?” Nerishev said. 

“In a moment.” Clasdon thought 
very quickly of the super-hurri- 
cane he had just passed through, 
which Smanik had classified as a 
moderate and harmless gale. He 
thought of their immobility, the 
ruined Brute, the strained foun- 
dations of the station, the wrecked 
boulder barrier, the relief ship 
four months away. “We could go 
with you in the land ships, Sma- 
nik, and take refuge in the cav- 



erns with you — be protected — ” 

“Of course,” said Smanik hos- 
pitably. 

“No, we couldn’t,” Clayton an- 
swered himself, his sinking feeling 
even lower than during the storm. 
“We’d need extra oxygen, our own 
food, a water supply — ” 

“What is it?” Nerishev repeated 
impatiently. “What the devil did 
he say to make you look like 
that?” 

“He says the really big winds 
are just coming,” Clayton replied. 

The two men stared at each 
other. 

Outside, a wind was rising.

THE MOON CONTRACT 

1 HAVE just had to check 
back to see when my book 
The Conquest of Space first 
appeared, because the date has 
some bearing on this story. Well, 
the copyright note says “First 
Published in September, 1949,” 
so it must have been in the early 
summer of that year. 

The book, as far as the me- 
chanical processes of production 
are concerned, had advanced al- 
most to the final stage. Color 
proofs of the paintings had been 



THE MOON CONTRACT 



61 



made and approved by Chesley 
Bonestell. Galley proofs of the 
text had been read and corrected. 
The page proofs had gone from 
printer to publisher to author and 
back the same way. All that was 
left for me to do was to wait. 

One morning during this wait- 
ing period, while reading the New 
York Times at breakfast, I found 
a little box, telling that Dr. Gerard 
P. Kuiper had found a hitherto 
unknown small satellite of Nep- 
tune. Most interesting, that. I 
dropped the Times, raced to the 
telephone, dialed my publisher 
and asked, “Is Conquest of Space 
on the presses?” 

The answer was something 
like, “It might be by now. If you 
want to know, I can call the 
printer and ask.” 

“Do that,” I said, “and if they 
haven’t started yet, tell them to 
wait till afternoon. I’m coming 
in.” 

The reason for this telephone 
call was that I realized that a few 
passages in the book were sud- 
denly wrong. There was one 
which read “the lonely moon of 
Neptune,” another one which read 
“Neptune’s single moon” and a 
third one that said “like Earth, 
Neptune has only one moon.” 
Don’t bother looking it up — the 
printer had planned to start the 
press run that same afternoon, 
and by 11:30, the three passages 
had been replaced by others 



which were factually correct and 
took the same amount of space. 

My reason for remembering 
this now is that I told the editor, 
while typing the changes, that my 
statement might be proved wrong 
for Ea’-th, too, one day. Well, as 
far as we can tell, it won’t be. 
Earth does have only one moon, 
we are sure now — reasonably 
sure, that is. 

A bout two weeks ago, I re- 
ceived a large brown enve- 
lope in the mail which said on 
the outside “Office of Ordnance 
Research, U. S. Army” and inside 
there was a 30-page report, on the 
cover of which it said in letters of 
diminishing size: 

PHYSICAL SCIENCE LABORATORY

Interim Report oh 
SEARCH FOR SMALL EARTH 
SATELLITES 
for the period 1953-56 
By 

Clyde W. Tombaugh 

Dr. Clyde W. Tombaugh, most 
Galaxy readers will probably re- 
call, is the discoverer of the 
planet Pluto, and early in 1954, 
it became known that the Office 
of Ordnance Research gave him, 
via Lowell Observatory and New 
Mexico State College, a research 
contract to find out whether 
Earth might not have another

6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



small moon, or possibly moons. 

I devoted part of my column in 
the September, 1954, issue of 
Galaxy to the news that such a 
search was on and I explained 
then why these additional moons, 
if they existed, had to be quite 
small. 

The story of the second moon 
of Earth has had a rather tena- 
cious life ever since 1870, which 
was the year when Jules Verne’s 
AutouT de la Lune appeared, the 
second part of his story about the 
shot to the Moon. In it, Verne 
provided the three inhabitants of 
his Moon projectile with a glimpse 
of the second moon of Earth and 
explained that a French astrono- 
mer by the name of Petit had 
postulated its existence. Although 
no figure for the size of this sec- 
ond moon is given in the story, 
the reader is left with the impres- 
sion that it must be rather sub- 
stantial, at least a mile in di- 
ameter. 

Astronomers declared at a later 
date that a moon a mile in diame- 
ter at the distance given by Petit 
(4650 miles) would have been 
discovered by the ancient Baby- 
lonians, since it would be, at cer- 
tain times, a rather easy naked- 
eye object. Before this fact was 
presented, several German astron- 
omers had spent some time trying 
to find Petit’s moon, which they 
punningly called Kleinchen. The 
point of the pun is that Petit is 



the French word for “little” or 
“small” while Kleinchen is Ger- 
man for “the little one.” Of course 
they did not find his moon. 

By the time Dr. Tombaugh 
started his search, it was quite 
clear that the additional satellite 
would be measured in feet and 
not in miles — how many feet de- 
pended, naturally, on the distance. 

N THE fall of 1954, the news 
came that Tombaugh had 
found two moons, one 400 miles 
out and another one at a distance 
of 600 miles. The story went with 
it that, when this rep>ort reached 
the Pentagon, a general asked 
suspiciously, “Are they natural?” 
That story may be true, but the 
report that two moons had been 
found was not. If anybody knows 
how it originated, he is keeping 
his lips tightly shut. At any event. 
Dr. Tombaugh wrote me at the 
time that the report was not true. 
Moreover, it referred to distances 
that had not even been investi- 
gated at the time. 

The search was made by tele- 
scopic camera and the sensitivity 
of the instrumentation was re- 
vealed with a sentence that has 
been quoted quite a number of 
times since. The equipment, the 
statement said, could discover a 
tennis ball at a height of 1000 
miles, provided only that it was 
white. It also could discover a 
V-2 rocket (which is just short of 



THE MOON CONTRACT 



63 



47 feet) at the distance of the 
Moon. 

This original statement has 
since been amended to read that 
the tennis ball could be found 
even if it showed itself only in 
half phase; the V-2 rocket near 
the Moon would have to be in 
full phase and also painted white; 

Any satellite of Earth — natural 
or artificial — which is closer than 
a certain limit would have to 
move so fast to stay in its orbit 
that it would rise in the west and 
set in the east. The limit just 
mentioned is 22,300 miles from 
the surface. At that distance, the 
satellite would have an orbital 
period of 24 hours and would 
neither rise nor set but just hang 
in the sky over one hemisphere 
and never be visible from the 
other. Satellites beyond that limit 
would behave as one expects 
them to behave. 

Let us assume now that we 
have a satellite 4000 miles from 
the surface. It would need just 
four hours to go around the Earth 
once. Knowing this, one can cal- 
culate how fast it would move 
across the sky. Then an astro- 
nomical camera can be geared to 
sweep across the sky at the same 
rate. 

If the satellite is in the field of 
vision of the camera, it would 
show up as a dot on the plate, 
while the fixed stars in the field 
of vision would show up as 

64 



streaks from edge to edge. If that 
satellite were at, say, 3700 miles, 
but the camera were set for a 
sweep for a 4000-mile satellite, it 
would still show up. It would 
have made a very short trail, very 
easily distinguishable from the 
edge-to-edge star streaks. 

It should be clear from this ex- 
planation that a satellite search 
with such equipment is mostly a 
question of patience, a commod- 
ity which must be built-in in any 
astronomer. It is “merely” a ques- 
tion of adjusting the camera for a 
whole series of sweeps, corre- 
sponding to various satellite dis- 
tances and orbital periods. If 
there is one, it must be caught 
sooner or later. 

J UST one dot or very short trail 
on a photographic plate is not 
enough proof, however. There 
might be a tiny bubble in the 
emulsion, a flaw of some kind — 
I mentioned once in this column 
that the planet Pluto was missed 
on a photographic plate (years 
before Tombaugh found it on an- 
other one) because the image 
happened to have fallen on such 
a flaw and was taken to be a part 
of it. To avoid being fooled by 
such an accidental dot, something 
else had to be done. 

It was this: when the trails of 
the fixed stars had moved to 
about the center of the plate, the 
camera was moved a little bit 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



without closing the shutter. The 
result of this action was that 
every star trail, at that point, 
made a very short vertical line 
and then continued on a different 
level. (For faint stars, this short 
vertical line did not register on 
the plate.) Now if there was a 
satellite at the distance for which 
the sweep was set, it would make 
two dots at the proper distance 
from each other. That there 
should be a plate flaw producing 
this effect was most unlikely. 

The search was conducted from 
Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, 
Arizona, which, in spite of its gen- 
erally fine location, had one dis- 
advantage which has to do with 
the position of the orbits of the 
imknown satellites relative to the 
Earth. 

There is, as far as I know, no 
rule that says that a satellite 
could not circle its planet going 
from pole to pole. The simple 
facts are that no such case is 
known and that it is highly un- 
likely for various theoretical rea- 
sons. 

A tiny satellite of Earth could 
have two possible origins. 

One is that it is a piece of 
debris from the Asteroid Belt 
which has, for some reason, been 
drifting inward in the Solar Sys- 
tem and has been captured by 
Earth. That would require such a 
peculiar sequence of astronomical 
events that it is not very likely. 



In most cases, such a piece of cos- 
mic matter drifting in toward the 
Earth would either simply pass 
on with a minor change in orbit, 
or else it would touch atmosphere 
and crash as a meteorite. Capture 
by the Earth would be exceeding- 
ly rare. 

But while capture would be lit- 
erally a case of much more than 
“one in a million,” it is not im- 
possible. Such a satellite would 
circle the Earth in about the 
plane of the ecliptic — the plane 
of the Earth’s orbit around the 
Sun. 

The other possibility has to do 
with our real and rather large 
moon. More and more astrono- 
mers seem to incline to the belief 
that the Moon was formed in an 
orbit around the Earth of loose 
matter, ranging in size from a few 
molecules of something to large 
mountains. 

I F THERE were pieces of this 
“Moon matter” left, they 
would orbit around the Earth in 
or very nearly in the plane of the 
Moon’s orbit. Since the plane of 
the Moon’s orbit and the ecliptic 
are inclined to each other by only 
five degrees, the search of these 
two planes is really the same 
thing, for some deviation from 
either one or the other must be 
taken for granted. 

The third possibility is that a 
satellite circles the Earth in the 



THE MOON CONTRACT 



65 



plane of its equator, inclined by 
23 V 2 degrees to the ecliptic. But 
a satellite over the equator would 
have been pulled into that orbit 
by the Earth’s equatorial bulge, 
which implies that it would be 
fairly low. If it weren’t, it wouldn’t 
be in that plane. This is where 
the search from Flagstaff left a 
hole in the picture. A moonlet 
circling the Earth over the equa- 
tor at a lesser distance than 1600 
miles from the surface could not 
be seen— or, rather, photographed 
— from Flagstaff. 

Strangely enough, the search 
for anything inside the orbit of 
the Moon was really virgin terri- 
tory. Barring the occasional look- 
ing for Kleinchen a few Germans 
had indulged in around the turn 
of the century, it had never been 
done. Well, we now know that 
there is nothing in that region, 
with the possible exception of 
equatorial orbits below 1600 
miles. For these. Dr. ^Tombaugh 
moved to Quito, Ecuador, where 
such moonlets would be vertically 
overhead. But the Interim Report 
was written before this move took 
place and covered only the work 
at Flagstaff. It concluded: 

Much of the space about the 
Earth has been searched. Most of 
this space has been found to be 
empty of material moving in the 
most-likely orbits and large enough 
to be seen by the present equip- 



ment Some “suspects” have been 
found on the photographic films, 
but in all save a few instances it 
has been possible to determine 
that the record was not that of a 
satellite. These images, if not due 
to defects in the photographic 
plates, could have been tracks of 
very small asteroids moving past 
the earth in their journey around 
the sun. The several suspects not 
yet eliminated as satellites are 
ones which cannot be checked un- 
til photographic work has started 
on the equator. From a statistical 
point of view, it is more likely 
that they will turn out not to be 
satellites. The chance of a discov- 
ery of astronomical or geodetic 
value has, from the beginnnig, 
been regarded as very small. But 
a completely negative result, a 
determination that the space near 
the earth is free of debris up to a 
certain size, could have comforting 
significance to long-range ballisti- 
cians and to proponents of space 
travel.* 

^I'HE explanation of the diffi- 
culty of capturing moonlets 
going around the Sun — because 
they go around the Sun, they are, 
of course, tiny planetoids or aster- 
oids — implied that any additional 
satellite that might have been

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fovind would most probably have 
been matter left over when the 
Moon formed. But if such matter 
was left over, it could go around 
the Earth in some other ways. 

One possibility was that it re- 
mained in the same orbit as the 
Moon, but circling the Earth 
either 60 degrees ahead of the 
Moon or 60 degrees behind the 
Moon. In the case of Jupiter and 
the so-called Trojan Asteroids, 
this has been found to be true — 
many years, incidentally, after it 
had been advanced as a theoreti- 
cal possibility. 

Having this nice equipment 
available, it was obvious that Dr. 
Tombaugh should use it to see 
whether there might be more 
moons in the orbit of the Moon. 
This particular phase of the search 
had been planned, but by the 
time the Interim Report was writ- 
ten, it had not been carried out, 
due largely to bad weather. 

But “left-over” Moon matter 
could still do something else. It 
could form secondary moons, 
moonlets of our moon. If such a 
secondary moon had been found, 
it would have been the first of its 
kind in the Solar System. It is 
perfectly possible that the larger 
moons in our solar system have 
such secondary moons, but if they 
do, they are all too small to be 
detected from the Earth. 

Secondary moons of our moon 
would have been fairly easy to 



identify, again if they were large 
enough to register on the photo- 
graphic plate. The most likely or- 
bit of such secondary moons 
would be again in the ecliptic, or 
else in the plane of the Moon’s 
orbit. Because of this, they would 
pass between Moon and Earth 
and then disappear behind the 
Moon. Twice during every circuit 
of the Moon, they would be at 
“greatest elongation,” which 
means farthest away from the 
Moon either to the east or to the 
west. 

Actually we would see this por- 
tion of the orbit strongly fore- 
shortened so that such a second- 
ary moon would remain nearly 
stationary, to the eye, near great- 
est elongation for a while. But no 
matter at what distance it is from 
the Moon, it would share the or- 
bital movement of the Moon. If 
you can catch a dot of light, on 
either side of the Moon, which 
travels across the sky at very 
nearly the rate of the Moon itself, 
you have caught a secondary 
moon. 

VT’OU probably could, that is, if 
you did it visually. If you 
try to do it photographically, 
chances are that the Moon will 
cover up the image of the second- 
ary satellite. The Moon is bright 
enough to ruin everything faint 
in its vicinity on a plate. Hence 
this particular search had to wait

for an eclipse of the Moon. 

As Dr. Tombaugh reported: 
“The crater Aristarchus is the 
brightest spot on the moon, and it 
can be seen in a telescope with 
some difficulty when the moon is 
in total eclipse. With a visual 
guide telescope on the same 
mounting with the Schmidt cam- 
era, one can guide the camera on 
Aristarchus and prevent the dilu- 
tion of possible satellite images.” 

All this had been worked out 
for the total eclipse of January 
18, 1954. “Unfortunately, on the 
night of the moon’s eclipse, the 
sky was covered by a thick haze.” 

At the time the report was writ- 
ten, there were hopes for the long- 
duration eclipse which took place 
at midnight, November 17-18, 
1956. 1 know that all the amateur 
astronomers in New York, Long 
Island and New Jersey were bit- 
terly disappointed, for there was 
more than just a thick haze. It 
poured. The weather must have 
been bad enough to be useless in 
Flagstaff, too, because no report 
about a secondary moon has come 
in yet. 

But while Tombaugh’s work is 
virtually definite for the space 
above 1600 miles (and lower 
down elsewhere than over the 
equator), a secondary moon of 
Earth, a moon of the Moon, and 
also “Trojan” moonlets in the 
Moon’s orbit, are still possible. 
Their discovery would, for the 

68 



time being, be of scientific inter- 
est only, but it would be inter- 
esting. 

Naturally an intensive search 
program of this type had all kinds 
of “by-products,” as Charles F. 
Capen of the New Mexico Col- 
lege called them in Sky and Tele- 
scope. A number of meteorites 
and one bright fireball were 
caught on the plates. A few others 
showed very strange zigzag de- 
signs — the Naval Observatory’s 
Flagstaff section had released a 
bunch of meteorological balloons 
at night without telling anybody. 
One night, an orange light moved 
noiselessly from north to south in 
a straight line; glasses proved it 
to be the exhaust of a high-flying 
jet. Another night, they had “Lub- 
bock Lights,” but they were a 
squadron of helicopters. 

Six months or so from now, an- 
other satellite watch will be on, 
but then it won’t be a natural sat- 
ellite. We’ll have made it our- 
selves. 

MOON ROCKET 

^ OME to think of it, it is really 
^ quite a long time since any- 
body talked about Moon rockets. 
Twenty-five to thirty years ago, 
before the time where there was 
any rocket “hardware,” things 
were different — the Moon rocket 
was a favorite topic of conversa- 
tion among rocket enthusiasts. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



As the actual engineering re- 
search began, the favorite idea of 
the Moon rocket began to be 
overshadowed by the nasty real- 
ity of an oxygen valve which 
leaked, and kept leaking no mat- 
ter what you did about it. And a 
parachute release that worked 
was more fascinating by far than 
the most elegant set of equations. 
As time went on, all thoughts con- 
centrated first on the high-alti- 
tude sounding rocket, then the 
long-range rocket, and finally on 
the artificial satellite. 

But now the Moon rocket is 
with us again, in a form which 
bears little resemblance to the 
drawings made thirty years ago, 
but with the encouraging mes- 
sage that it could be built later 
this year if somebody can be 
found to sign some papers. 

However, a little background is 
needed first. In Professor Her- 
mann Oberth’s writings — from 
1923 to 1929 ■— you can find a 
discussion of something he called 
the “optimal velocity.” The prob- 
lem was this; a rising rocket has 
to fight air resistance, and air re- 
sistance goes up very sharply as ■ 
the velocity increases. 

As far as air resistance was con- 
cerned, a slowly accelerating 
rocket was far better than a 
quickly accelerating rocket. But 
while the rocket struggled up 
through a resisting atmosphere, 
slowly, it also lost 32 feet per sec- 



ond of velocity every second, be- 
cause Earth tried to pull it back. 

Hence, as far as gravitation 
was concerned, the quickly accel- 
erating rocket beat the slowly ac- 
celerating rocket tailfins down. 

There had to be a happy me- 
dium, a rocket which did not cre- 
ate too much air resistance for 
itself and did not lose too much 
speed to gravity, either. And that 
was the “optimal velocity.” 

The first large rockets, the 
V-2s, happened not to be troubled 
by that problem. They could not 
accelerate very fast because they 
were so heavy. By the time they 
got to be really fast, they were 
above 60,000 feet, with about 90 
per cent of the atmosphere below 
them. Large rockets which were 
capable of very high accelerations 
were still to come. But they came, 
the big solid fuel rockets we now 
have, which are mostly used to 
boost heavy missiles into the air. 

If one had tried to fire such 
heavy solid fuel rockets, or clus- 
ters of them, from the surface, 
there would have been trouble 
with air resistance. And this is 
not just theory, for such clusters, 
named HTVs or Hypersonic Test 
Vehicles, have been fired to meas- 
ure air resistance at very high 
velocities. 

T N THE meantime. Dr. James 
-*■ A. Van Allan of Iowa Univer- 
sity had tried something else. 



THE MOON CONTRACT 



69 



There is a medium-sized solid- 
fuel rocket called the Deacon. 
When fired vertically from sea 
level, it can reach a height of 

60,000 feet, or not quite 12 miles. 
Van Allan had the Deacon lifted 
by a plastic Skyhook balloon to 
about 12 miles and fired it from 
there. It went to 55 and 60 miles 
because it did not have to fight 
much air resistance. 

This rocket-balloon combina- 
tion was dubbed the Rockoon and 
some important research work 
has been done with it recently. 
More of it will come during the 
International Geophysical Year. 

Knowing all this, we are now 
ready to understand the new 
Moon rocket, presented for the 
first time in a paper read in Sep- 
tember, 1956, at the International 
Astronautical Congress in Rome. 
The authors of the paper were 
Kurt R. Stehling and Richard 
Foster, both of them propulsion 
engineers for the Naval Research 
Laboratory and presumably quite 
busy with the Vanguard satellite- 
carrier rockets. 

The “first stage” of the new 
Moon rocket is a Skyhook bal- 
loon which must be able to lift a 
rocket weighing 26,574 lbs. to a 
height of 70,000 feet. This, Stehl- 
ing said, means a balloon of a 
capacity of four million cubic feet, 
adding that three-million-cubic- 
foot Skyhooks have been built 
and launched. 

70 



The Moon rocket would hang 
vertically below the balloon and 
tear through it when ignited. This 
will not hamper the rocket a bit 
and will not even cause an avoid- 
able loss of the balloon, for the 
plastic skin of Skyhook balloons 
is so thin that they can be used 
only once; they can never be re- 
covered intact for reuse. 

The rocket itself is a three-step 
affair. 

Step No. 1 is a so-called “clus- 
ter” of four large solid-fuel units, 
weighing together 25,000 lbs., but 
developing a thrust of 236,000 
lbs. They would burn for about 
20 seconds. At the end of the 
burning time, the rocket will be 

70.000 -f- 110,000 feet up and 
will be going with a velocity very 
close to 13,000 feet per second. 
At an altitude of 180,000 feet, 
you don’t have to worry about air 
resistance any more, so the next 
stage, also solid fuel, will be ig- 
nited at once. 

The weight of Step No. 2 is 
1510 lbs. It will also burn for 20 
seconds, producing a thrust of 

14.000 lbs. When its fuel is gone, 
it will be 280,000 feet high and 
the velocity will be slightly more 
than 26,400 feet per second. 

Then Step No. 3 takes over. 
Compared to what carried it, it is 
tiny, a 60-pound solid-fuel rocket 
with four pounds of “payload” in 
the nose. It will burn for only 10 
seconds, but when it is finished, it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



will be 352,000 feet up and its 
velocity will be 39,504 feet per 
second. 

L ess than one minute after the 
order “Fire!” Step No. 3 will 
be coasting to where the Moon 
will be four days later, for the 
time to traverse this distance will 
be about four days. The rocket 
will be too small to be seen in a 
telescope or to be tracked by 
radar. But radar ought to be able 
to track the larger stages, so that 



there should be enough tracking 
data for a trajectory computation. 

The time of the impact will be 
fairly well known, but just where 
the rocket will strike the Moon 
will not be known in advance. It 
is possible that observers may 
miss the impact for this reason. 
But the four pounds of payload 
are such that they will make a 
permanent gnd telescopically con- 
spicuous mark on the lunar sur- 
face.

I 



F our of the men, Weinroth, 
McAllister, Danboufge and 
Smith, sat at the table un- 
der the cold blue lighting tubes. 
One of them, Rorke, was in a cor- 
ner speaking quietly into a tele- 
phone, and one, Fadderman, stood 
staring out the window at the 
lights of the city. One, Hansen, 
had yet to arrive. 

Fadderman spoke without turn- 
ing his head. He was the oldest 
of those present — the Big Seven, 
as they were often called. 

“Lights,” he said. “So many 
lights. Down here.” He waved his 
hand toward the city. “Up there.” 
He gestured toward the sky. 
“Even with our much-vaunted 
knowledge, what,” he asked, “do 
we know?” He turned his head. 
“Perhaps this is too big for us. In 
the light of the problem, can we 
really hope to accomplish any- 
thing?” 

Heavy-set Danbourge frowned 
grimly. “We have received the 
suffrage of our fellow-scientists. 
Doctor. We can but try.” 

Lithe, handsome McAllister, 
che youngest officer of the Associ- 
ation, nodded. “The problem is 
certainly not greater than that 
which faced our late, great col- 
league, the immortal Morton.” He 
pointed to a picture on the pan- 
neled wall. “And we all know 
what he accomplished.”

Fadderman went over and took 
his hand. “Your words fill me with 
courage.” 

McAllister flushed with pleas- 
ure. 

“I am an old man,” Fadderman 
added falteringly. “Forgive my 
lack of spirit, Doctor” He sat 
down, sighed, shook his head 
slowly. Weinroth, burly and red- 
haired, patted him gently on the 
back. Natty, silvery-haired little 
Smith smiled at him consolingly. 

A BUZZER sounded. Rorke 
hung up the telephone, flipped 
a switch on the wall intercom. 
“Headquarters here,” he said 
crisply. 

“Dr. Carl T. Hansen has ar- 
rived,” a voice informed him. 

“Bring him up at once,” he di- 
rected. “And, Nickerson — ” 

“Yes, Dr. Rorke?” 

“Let no one else into the build- 
ing. No one.” 

They sat in silence. After a mo- 
ment or two, they heard the ap- 
proach of the elevator, heard the 
doors slide open, slide shut, heard 
the elevator descend. Heavy, 
steady footsteps approached; 
knuckles rapped on the opaque 
glass door. 

Rorke went over to the door, 
said, “A conscientious and diligent 
scientist — ” 

must remain a continual stu- 
dent,” a deep voice finished the 
quotation. 



Rorke unlocked the door, 
peered out into the corridor, ad- 
mitted Hansen, locked the door. 

“I would have been here 
sooner, but another emergency in- 
terposed,” Hansen said. “A certain 
political figure — ethics prevent 
my being more specific — suf- 
fered an oral hemorrhage follow- 
ing an altercation with a woman 
who shall be nameless, but, boy, 
did she pack a wallop! A so-called 
Specialist, gentlemen, with offices 
on Park Avenue, had been, as he 
called it, ‘applying pressure’ with 
a gauze pad. I merely used a lit- 
tle Gelfoam as a coagulant agent 
and the hemorrhage stopped al- 
most at once. When will the pub- 
lic learn, eh, gentlemen?” 

Faint smiles played upon the 
faces of the assembled scientists. 
Hansen took his seat. Rorke bent 
down and lifted two tape-record- 
ing devices to the table, set them 
both in motion. The faces of the 
men became serious, grim. 

“This is an emergency session 
of the Steering Committee of the 
Executive Committee of the 
American Dental Association,” 
Rorke said, “called to discuss 
measures of dealing with the case 
of Dr. Morris Goldpepper. One 
tape will be deposited in the 
vaults of the Chase Manhattan 
Bank in New York; the other will 
be similarly secured in the vaults 
of the Wells Fargo and Union 
Trust Company Bank in San

Francisco. Present at this session 
are Doctors Rorke, Weinroth and 
Smith — President, First and Sec- 
ond Vice-presidents, respectively 
— Fadderman, Past President, Mc- 
Allister, Public Information, Dan- 
bourge, Legal, and Hansen, Pol- 
icy.” 

He looked around at the set, 
tense faces. 

“Doctors,” he went on, “I think 
I may well say that humanity is, 
as of this moment, face to face 
with a great danger, and it is a 
bitter jest that it is not to the en- 
gineers or the astronomers, not to 
medicine nor yet to nuclear nor 
any other kind of physics, that 
humanity must now look for sal- 
vation — but to the members of 
the dental profession!” 

His voice rose. “Yes — to the 
practitioners of what has become 
perhaps the least regarded of all 
the learned sciences! It is indeed 
ironical. We may at this juncture 
consider the comments of the now 
deceased Professor Earnest Hoo- 
ton, the Harvard anthropologist, 
who observed with a sorrow 
which did him credit that his 
famed University, instead of as- 
sisting its Dental School as it 
ought, treated it — and I quote his 
exact words — ‘Like a yellow 
dog.’ ” His voice trembled. 

']%/|' cALLISTER’S clean-cut face 
J-’-*- flushed an angry red. Wein- 
roth growled. Danbourge’s fist hit 



the table and stayed there, 
clenched. Fadderman gave a soft, 
broken sigh. 

“But enough of this. We are 
not jealous, nor are we vindic- 
tive,” President Rorke went on. 
“We are confident that History, 
‘with its long tomorrow,’ will show 
how, at this danger-fraught point, 
the humble and little thought-of 
followers of dental science recog- 
nized and sized up the situation 
and stood shoulder to shoulder on 
the ramparts!” 

He wiped his brow with a 
paper tissue. “And now I will call 
upon our beloved. Past President, 
Dr. Samuel I. Fadderman, to be- 
gin our review of the incredible 
circumstances which have brought 
us here tonight. Dr. Fadderman? 
If you please . .” 

The well-known Elder States- 
man of the A.D.A. nodded his 
head slowly. He made a little 
cage of his fingers and pursed and 
then unpursed his lips. At length 
he spoke in a soft and gentle 
voice. 

“My first comment, brethren, 
is that I ask for compassion. 
Morris Goldpepper is not to 
blame! 

“Let me tell you a few words 
about him. Goldpepper the Scien- 
tist needs no introduction. Who 
has not read, for instance, his 
‘The Bilateral Vertical Stroke 
and Its Influence on the Pattern 
of Occlusion’ or his ‘Treatment, 

7S 



HELPI I AM DR. MORRIS GOLDPEPPER 



Planning, Assemblage and Ce- 
mentation of a 14-Unit Fixed 
Bridge’— to name only two? But 
I shall speak about Goldpepper 
the Man. He is forty-six years of 
age and served with honor in the 
United States Navy Dental Corps 
during the Second World War. 
He has been a widower since 
shortly after the conclusion of 
that conflict. Rae — the late Mrs. 
Goldpepper, may she rest in peace 
— often, used to say, ‘Morry, if I 
go first, promise me you’ll marry 
again,’ but he passed it off with a 
joke; and, as you know, he never 
did. 

“They had one child, a daugh- 
ter, Suzanne, a very sweet girl, 
now married to a Dr. Sheldon 
Fingerhut, D.D.S. I need not tell 
you, brethren, how proud our col- 
league was when his only child 
married this very fine young 
member of our profession. The 
Fingerhuts are now located on 
Unbalupi, one of the Micronesian 
islands forming part of the United 
States Trust Territory, where Dr. 
Sheldon is teaching dental hy- 
giene, sanitation and prosthesis to 
the natives thereof.” 

Dr. Hansen asked, “Are they 
aware of — ” 

“The son-in-law knows some- 
thing of the matter,” the older 
man said. “He has not seen fit to 
inform his wife, who is in a deli- 
cate condition and expects shortly 
to be confined. At his suggestion. 



I have been writing — or, rather, 
typing — letters purporting to 
come from her father, on his sta- 
tionery, with the excuse that he 
badly singed his fingers on a 
Bunsen burner while annealing a 
new-type hinge for dentures and 
consequently cannot hold his 
pen.” He sipped from a glass of 
water. 

“Despite his great scientific ac- 
complishments,” Dr. Fadderman 
went on, “Morry had an imprac- 
tical streak in him. Often I used 
to call on him at his bachelor 
apartment in the Hotel Daven- 
port on West End Avenue, where 
he moved following his daughter’s 
marriage, and I would find hiip 
immersed in reading matter of an 
escapist kind — tales of crocodile 
hunters on the Malayan Penin- 
sula, or magazines dealing with 
interplanetary warfare, or collec- 
tions of short stories about vam- 
pires and werewolves and similar 
superstitious creations. 

“ ‘Morry,’ I said reproachfully, 
‘what a way to spend your off- 
hours. Is it worth it? Is it healthy? 
You would do much better, be- 
lieve me, to frequent the pool or 
the handball court at the Y. Or,’ 
I pointed out to him, ‘if you want 
to read, why ignore the rich treas- 
ures of literature: Shakespeare, 
Ruskin, Elbert Hubbard, Edna 
Ferber, and so on? Why retreat to 
these immature-type fantasies?’ 
At first he only smiled and quoted 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the saying, ‘Each to his or her 
own taste.’” 

^I^HE silence which followed 
was broken by young Dr. Mc- 
Allister. “You say,” he said, ‘“at 
first.’ ” 

Old Dr. Fadderman snapped 
out of his revery. “Yes, yes. But 
eventually he confessed the truth 
to me. He withheld nothing.” 

The assembled dental scientists 
then learned that the same Dr. 
Morris Goldpepper, who had been 
awarded not once but three suc- 
cessive times the unique honor of 
the Dr. Alexander Peabody 
Medal for New Achievements in 
Dental Prosthesis, was obsessed 
with the idea that there was sen- 
tient life on other worlds — that 
it would shortly be possible to 
teach these other worlds — and 
that he himself desired to be 
among those who went. 

“ ‘Do you realize, Sam?’ he 
asked me,” reported Fadderman. 
“ ‘Do you realize that, in a very 
short time, it will no longer be a 
question of fuel or even of metal- 
lurgy? That submarines capable 
of cruising for weeks and months 
without surfacing foretell the pos- 
sibility of traveling through air- 
less space? The chief problem has 
now come down to finding how to 
build a takeoff platform capable 
of withstanding a thrust of sev- 
eral million pounds.’ And his eyes 
glowed.” 



Dr. Fadderman had inquired, 
with good-natured sarcasm, how 
the other man expected this 
would involve him. The answer 
was as follows: Any interplane- 
tary expedition would find it just 
as necessary to take along a den- 
tist as to take along a physician, 
and that he — Dr. Goldpepper — 
intended to be that dentist! 

Dr. Weinroth’s hand slapped 
the table with a bang. “By thun- 
der, I say the man had courage!” 
Dr. Rorke looked at him with 
icy reproof. “I should be obliged,” 
he said stiffly, “if there would be 
no further emotional outbursts.” 
Dr. Weinroth’s face fell. “I beg 
the Committee’s pardon, Mr. 
President,” he said. 

Dr. Rorke nodded graciously, 
indicated by a gesture of his hand 
that Dr. Fadderman had permis- 
sion to continue speaking. The 
old man took a letter from his 
pocket and placed it on the table. 

“This came to me like a bolt 
from the blue beyond. It is dated 
November 8 of last year. Skipping 
the formal salutation, it reads: 
‘At last I stand silent upon the 
peak in Darien’— a literary refer- 
ence, gentlemen, to Cortez’s al- 
leged discovery of the Pacific 
Ocean; actually it was Balboa — 
‘my great dream is about to be 
realized. Before long, I shall be 
back to tell you about it, but just 
exactly when, I am not able to 
say. History is being made! Long

live Science! Sincerely yours, 
Morris Goldpepper, D.D.S.’” 

He passed the letter around the 
table. 

Dr. Smith asked, “What did 
you do on receiving this commu- 
nication, Doctor?” 

Dr. Fadderman had at once 
taken a taxi to West End Avenue. 
The desk clerk at the hotel cour- 
teously informed him that the 
man he sought had left on a va- 
cation of short but not exactly 
specified duration. No further in- 
formation was known. Dr. Fad- 
derman’s first thought was that 
his younger friend had gotten 
some sort of position with a Gov- 
ernment project which he was not 
free to discuss, and his own patri- 
otism and sense of duty naturally 
prevented him from making in- 
quiries. 

“But I began, for the first time,” 
the Elder Statesman of American 
Dentistry said, “to read up on the 
subject of space travel. I won- 
dered how a man 46 years of age 
could possibly hope to be selected 
over younger men.” 

Dr. Danbourge spoke for the 
first time. “Size,” he said. “Every 
ounce would count in a spaceship 
and Morris was a pretty little 
guy.” 

“But with the heart of a lion,” 
Dr. Weinroth said softly. “Miles 
and miles and miles of heart.” 
The other men nodded their 
agreement to this tribute. 



"DUT as time went on and the 
year drew to its close and he 
heard no word from his friend. 
Dr. Fadderman began to worry. 
Finally, when he received a letter 
from the Fingerhuts, saying that 
they had not been hearing either, 
he took action. 

He realized it was not likely 
that the Government would have 
made plans to include a dentist in 
this supposed project without 
communicating with the A.D.A. 
and he inquired of the current 
President, Dr. Rorke, if he had 
any knowledge of such a project, 
or of the whereabouts of the miss- 
ing man. The answer to both 
questions was no. But on learning 
the reasons for Dr. Fadderman’s 
concern, he communicated with 
Col. Lemuel Coggins, head of the 
USAF’s Dental Corps. 

Col. Coggins informed him that 
no one of Dr. Goldpepper’s name 
or description was or had been 
affiliated with any such project, 
and that, in fact, any such project 
was still — as he put it — “still on 
the drawing-board.” 

Drs. Rorke and Fadderman, 
great as was their concern, hesi- 
tated to report Dr. Goldpepper 
missing. He had, after all, paid 
rent on apartment, office and lab- 
oratory, well in advance. He was 
a mature man, of very consider- 
able intelligence, and one who 
presumably knew what he was 
doing.

“It is at this point,” said Dr. 
Danbourge, “that I enter the pic- 
ture. On the 11th of January, I 
had a call from a Dr. Milton Wil- 
son, who has an office on East 
19th Street, with a small labora- 
tory adjoining, where he does 
prosthetic work. He told me, with 
a good deal of hesitation, that 
something exceedingly odd had 
come up, and he asked me if I 
knew where Dr. Morris Goldpep- 
per was . .” 

The morning of the 11th of 
January, an elderly man with a 
curious foreign accent came into 
Dr. Wilson’s office, gave the name 
of Smith and complained about 
an upper plate. It did not feel 
comfortable, Mr. Smith said, and 
it irritated the roof of his mouth. 
There was a certain reluctance on 
his part to allow Dr. Wilson to 
examine his mouth. This was un- 
derstandable, because the interior 
of his mouth was blue. The gums 
were entirely edentulous, very 
hard, almost horny. The plate it- 
self — 

“Here is the plate,” Dr. Dan- 
bourge said, placing it on the 
table. “Dr. Wilson supplied him 
with another. You will observe 
the perforations on the upper, or 
palatal, surface. They had been 
covered with a thin layer of gum 
arable, which naturally soon wore 
almost entirely off, with the result 
that the roof of the mouth be- 
came irritated. Now this is so 



very unusual that Dr. Wilson — 
as soon as his patient, the so- 
called Mr. Smith, was gone — 
broke open the weirdly made 
plate to find why the perforations 
had been made. In my capacity 
as head of the Association’s Legal 
Department,” Dr. Danbourge 
stated, “I have come across some 
extraordinary occurrences, but 
nothing like this.” 

This was a small piece of a 
white, flexible substance, covered 
with tiny black lines. Danbourge 
picked up a large magnifying 
glass. 

“You may examine these ob- 
jects, Doctors,” he said, “but it 
will save your eyesight if I read 
to you from an enlarged photo- 
static copy of this last one. The 
nature of the material, the method 
of writing, or of reducing the writ- 
ing to such size all are unknown 
to us. It may be something on the 
order of microfilm. But that is 
not important. The important 
thing is the content of the writ- 
ing — the portent of the writing. 

“Not since E>r. Morton, the 
young Boston dentist, realized the 
uses of sulphuric ether as an anes- 
thetic has any member of our 
noble profession discovered any- 
thing of even remotely similar im- 
portance; and perhaps not before, 
either.” 

He drew his spectacles from 
their case and began to read 
aloud.

the druggists — not having a Hip- 
pocratic Oath — can preen them- 
selves on their so-called Oath of 
Maimonides (though, believe me, 
the great Maimonides had no 
more to do with it than Morris 
Goldpepper, D.D.S.), no one can 
charge us with not having as high 
a standard of ethics and profes- 
sional conduct as physicians and 
surgeons, M.D. Nor do I hesitate 
for one single moment to include 
prostheticians not holding the de- 
gree of Doctor of Dental Surgery 
or Doctor of Dental Medicine, 
whose work is so vital and essen- 
tial. 

When the records of our civili- 
zation are balanced, then — but 
perhaps not before — the real im- 
portance of dental science will be 
appreciated. Now it is merely val- 
ued at the moment of toothache. 

It is only with a heavy heart 
that I undertake deliberately to 
produce inferior work, and with 
the confidence that all those to 
whom the standards of oral sur- 
gery and dental prosthetics are 
dear will understand the very un- 
usual circumstances which have 
prompted me so to do. And, un- 
derstanding, will forgive. No one 
can hold the standards of our pro-

fession higher or more sacred 
than I. 

It must be admitted that I was 
not very amused on a certain oc- 
casion when my cousin, Nathan- 
iel Pomerance, introduced me to 
an engineering contractor with 
these words, “You two should 
have a lot in common — you both 
build bridges,” and uttered a fool- 
ish laugh. But I venture to say 
that this was one of the truest 
words ever spoken in question- 
able jest. 

Humility is one thing, false 
pride another. Those who know 
anything of modern dentistry at 
all know of the Goldpepper 
Bridge and the Goldpepper 
Crown. It is I, Dr. Morris Gold- 
pepper, inventor of both, and per- 
fector of the Semi-retractable 
Clasp which bears my name, who 
writes these words you see before 
you. Nothing further should be 
needful by way of identification. 
And now to my report. 

On the first of November,'a day 
of evil import forever in the per- 
sonal calendar of the unhappy 
wretch who writes these lines, not 
even knowing for sure if they will 
ever be read — but what else can 
I do?— shortly after 5:00 P.M., 
my laboratory door was knocked 
on. I found there a curious-look- 
ing man of shriveled and weaz- 
ened appearance. He asked if I 
was Dr. Morris Goldpepper, “the 
famous perfector of the Semi-re- 



81 



tractable Clasp,” and I pleaded 
guilty to the flattering impeach- 
ment. 

The man had a foreign-sound- 
ing accent, or — I thought — it 
may be that he had an impedi- 
ment in his speech. Might he see 
me, was his next question. I hesi- 
tated. 

I T HAS happened to me before, 
and to most other practition- 
ers — a stranger comes and, before 
you know it, he is slandering 
some perfectly respectable D.D.S. 
or D.M.D. The dentist pulled a 
healthy tooth — the dentist took 
such and such a huge sum of 
money for new plates — they don’t 
fit him, he suffers great anguish — 
he’s a poor man, the dentist won’t 
do anything — et cetera, ad infini- 
tum nauseamque. In short, a nut, 
a crank, a crackpot. 

But while I was hesitating, the 
man yawned, did not courteously 
cover his mouth with his hand, 
and I observed to my astonish- 
ment that the interior of his 
mouth was an odd shade of blue! 

Bemused by this singular de- 
parture from normalcy, I allowed 
him to enter. Then I wondered 
what to say, since he himself was 
saying nothing, but he looked 
around the lab with interest. 
“State your business” would be 
too brusque, and “Why is your 
mouth blue?” would be too 
gauche. An impasse. 

82 



Whilst holding up a large-scale 
model of the Goldpepper Cap 
(not yet perfected — will it ever 
be? Alas, who knows?) this curi- 
ous individual said, “I know all 
about you. Dentist Goldpepper. A 
great scientist, you are. A man of 
powerful imagination, you are. 
One who rebels against narrow 
horizons and yearns to soar to 
wide and distant worlds, you are.” 

All I could think of to say was, 
“And what can I do for you?” 

It was all so true; every single 
word he said was true. In my van- 
ity was my downfall. I was 
tricked like the crow with the 
cheese in the ancient fable of 
Aesop. 

The man proceeded to tell me, 
frankly enough, that he was a 
denizen of another planet. He had 
two hearts, would you believe it? 
And, consequently, two circula- 
tory systems. Two pulses — one in 
each arm, one slow, the other fast. 

It reminded me of the situation 
in Philadelphia some years ago 
when there were two telephone 
systems — if you had only a Bell 
phone, you couldn’t call anyone 
who had only a Keystone phone. 

The interior of his mouth was 
blue and so was the inside of his 
eyelids. He said his world had 
three moons. 

You may imagine my emotions 
at hearing that my long-felt dream 
to communicate with otherworld- 
ly forms of sentient life was at

last realized! And to think that 
they had singled out not the 
President of the United States, 
not the Director-General of the 
U.N., but me, Morris Goldpep- 
per, D.D.S.! Could human happi- 
ness ask for more, was my un- 
spoken question. I laughed softly 
to myself and I thought. What 
would my cousin Nathaniel Pom- 
erance say now? I was like wax 
in this extraterrestrial person’s 
hands (he had six distinct and 
articulate digits on each one), and 
I easily agreed to say nothing to 
anyone until the question of dip- 
lomatic recognition could be ar- 
ranged on a higher echelon. 

“Non-recognition has its advan- 
tages, Goldpepper Dental Sur- 
geon,” he said with a slight smile. 
“No passport for your visit, you 
will need.” 

Well! A personal invitation to 
visit Proxima Centauri Gamma, 
or whatever the planet’s name is! 
But I felt constrained to look this 
gift-horse just a little closer in the 
mouth. How is it that they came 
inviting me, not, let us say, Op- 
penheimer? Well? 

“Of his gifts not in need, we 
are. Surgical Goldpepper. We 
have passed as far beyond nu- 
clear power as you have beyond 
wind power. We can span the 
Universe — but in dentistry^ like 
children still, we are. Come and 
inspect our faculties of your sci- 
ence, Great Goldpepper. If you 



say, ‘This: Yes,’ then it will be 
yes. If you direct, ‘This: No,’ then 
it will be no. In respect to the sci- 
ence of dentistry, our Edison and 
our Columbus, you will be.” 

I asked when we would leave 
and he said in eight days. I asked 
how long the trip would take. For 
a moment, I was baffled when he 
said it would take no longer than 
to walk the equivalent of the 
length of the lab floor. Then he 
revealed his meaning to me: Mat- 
ter transmission! Of course. No 
spaceship needed. 

1%/T Y NEXT emotion was a 
brief disappointment at not 
being able to see the blazing stars 
in black outer space. But, after 
all, one ought not be greedy at 
such a time. 

I cannot point out too strongly 
that at no time did I accept or 
agree to accept any payment or 
gratuity for this trip. I looked 
upon it in the same light as the 
work I have done for various 
clinics. 

“Should I take along books? 
Equipment? What?” I asked my 
(so-to-speak) guide. 

He shook his head. Only my 
presence was desired on the first 
trip. A visit of inspection. Very 
well. 

On the morning of Nov. 8th, I 
wrote a brief note to my old and 
dear friend. Dr. Samuel Fadder- 
man, the senior mentor of Ameri- 



HELP! I AM DR. MORRIS GOLDPEPPER 



can Dentistry [on hearing these 
words, the Elder Statesman 
sobbed softly into his cupped 
hands], and in the afternoon, so 
excited and enthralled that I no- 
ticed no more of my destination 
than that it was north of the 
Washington Market, I accompa- 
nied my guide to a business build- 
ing in the aforesaid area. 

He led me into a darkened 
room. He clicked a switch. There 
was a humming noise, a feeling 
first of heaviness, then of weight- 
lessness, and then an odd sort of 
light came on. 

I was no longer on the familiar 
planet of my birth! I was on an 
unknown world! 

Over my head, the three moons 
Of this far-off globe sailed majes- 
tically through a sky wherein I 
could note unfamiliar constella- 
tions. The thought occurred to me 
that poets on this planet would 
have to find another rhyme, inas- 
much as moons (plural form) 
does not go with June (singular 
form). One satellite was a pale 
yellow, one was brown, and' the 
third was a creamy pink. Not 
knowing the names of these lu- 
nary orbs in the native tongue, I 
decided to call them Vanilla, 
Chocolate and Strawberry. 

Whilst my mind was filled with 
these droll fancies, I felt a tug at 
my sleeve, where my guide was 
holding it. He gestured and I fol- 
lowed. 



“Now,” I thought to myself, “he 
will bring me before the President 
of their Galactic Council, or what- 
ever he is called,” and I stood 
obediently within a circle marked 
on the surface of the platform 
whereon we stood. 

In a moment, we were matter- 
transported to an inside room 
somewhere, and there I gazed 
about me in stupefaction, not to 
say astonishment. My eyes dis- 
cerned the forms of Bunsen burn- 
ers, Baldor lathes, casting ma- 
chines and ovens, denture trays, 
dental stone, plaster, shellac trays, 
wires of teeth, and all the neces- 
sary equipment of a fully equipped 
dental prosthetic laboratory. 

My surprise at the progress 
made by these people in the sci- 
ence at which they were allegedly 
still children was soon mitigated 
by the realization that all the 
items had been made on Earth. 

A S I was looking and examin- 
ing, a door opened and sev- 
eral people entered. Their faces 
were a pale blue, and I realized 
suddenly that my guide must be 
wearing makeup to conceal his 
original complexion. They spoke 
together in their native dialect; 
then one of them, with a rod of 
some kind in his hand, turned to 
me. He opened his mouth. I per- 
ceived his gums were bare. 

“Dentical person,” he said, 
“make me teeth.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

I turned in some perplexity to 
my guide. “I understood you to 
say my first visit would be one of 
inspection only.” 

Everyone laughed, and I ob- 
served that all were equally 
toothless. 

The man in the chair poked 
me rudely with his rod or staff. 
“Talk not! Make teeth!” 

Fuming with a well-justified 
degree of indignation, I protested 
at such a gross breach of the laws 
of common hospitality. Then, 
casting concealment to the winds, 
these people informed me as fol- 
lows : 

Their race is entirely toothless 
in the adult stage. They are an 
older race than ours and are born 
looking ancient and wrinkled. It is 
only cornparatively recently that 
they have established contact 
with Earth, and in order that they 
should not appear conspicuous, 
and in order to be able to eat our 
food, they realized that they must 
be supplied with artificial teeth. 

My so-called guide, false friend, 
my enticer and/or kidnaper, to 
give him his due, had gotten fitted 
at a dentist’s in New York and 
cunningly enquired who was the 
leading man in the field. Alas for 
fame! The man answered without 
a second of hesitation, “That is no 
other one than Morris Goldpep- 
per, D.D.S., perfector of the Semi- 
retractable Clasp.” 

First this unscrupulous extra- 



terrestrial procured the equip- 
ment, then he procured me. 

“Do I understand that you pur- 
port that I assist you in a plan to 
thwart and otherwise circumvent 
the immigration laws of the 
United States?” was my enquiry. 

The man in the chair poked me 
with his rod again. “You under- 
stand! So now make teeth!” 

What a proposition to make to 
a law-abiding, patriotic American 
citizen by birth! What a demand 
to exact of a war veteran, a tax- 
payer and one who has been 
three times on jury duty since 
1946 alone (People vs. Garrity, 
People vs. Vanderdam, and Lip- 
schutz vs. Krazy-Kut Kool Kaps, 
Inc.)! My whole being revolted. I 
spoke coldly to them, informing 
them that the situation was con- 
trary to my conception of dental 
ethics. But to no avail. 

My treacherous dragoman drew 
a revolver from his pocket. “Our 
weapons understand, you do not. 
Primitive Earth weapons, yes. So 
proceed with manufacture. Im- 
prisoned Goldpepper.” 

I went hot and cold. Not, I beg 
of you to understand, with fear, 
but with humiliation. Imprisoned 
Goldpepper! The phrase, with all 
the connotations it implied, rang 
in my ears. 

I bowed my head and a phrase 
from the literary work “Sampson 
Agonistes” (studied as a student 
in the College of the City of New 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



York) rang through my mind: 
Eyeless in Gaza, grinding corn . 
Oh, blind, blind, blind, amidst the 
blaze of noon. 

But even in this hour of mental 
agony, an agony which has 
scarcely abated to speak of, I had 
the first glimmering of the idea 
which I hope will enable me to 
warn Earth. 

Vj^ITHOUT a word, but only a 
** scornful glance to show these 
blue-complected individuals how 
well I appreciated that their so- 
called advanced science was a 
mere veneer over the base metal 
of their boorishness, I set to work. 
I made the preliminary impres- 
sions and study casts, using an 
impression tray with oval floor 
form, the best suited for taking 
impressions of edentulous ridges. 

And so began the days of my 
slavery. 

Confined as I am here, there is 
neither day nor night, but an un- 
remitting succession of frenum 
trims, post dams, boxing in, pour- 
ing up, festoon carving, fixing 
sprue channels, and all the innu- 
merable details of dental prosthetic 
work. No one as;, ts me. No one 
converses with me, save in 
brusque barks j devant to the 
work at hand. My 1 lod consists of 
liqueous and t atinous sub- 
stances such as m i irt be expected 
would form the di : of a toothless 
race. 



Oh, I am sick of the sight of 
their blue skins, bluer mouths and 
horny ridges! I am sick of my 
serfdom! 

I have been given material to 
keep records and am writing this 
in expectation of later reducing it 
in size by the method here em- 
ployed, and of thereinafter insert- 
ing copies between the palatal 
and occlusual surfaces of the 
plates. It will be necessary to 
make such plates imperfect, so 
that the wearers will be obliged 
to go to dentists on Earth for re- 
pairs, because it is not always 
practical for them to matterport 
— in fact, I believe they can only 
do it on the 8th day of every third 
month. Naturally, I cannot do this 
to every plate, for they might be- 
come suspicious. 

You may well imagine how it 
goes against my grain to produce 
defective work, but I have no 
other choice. Twice they have 
brought me fresh dental supplies, 
which is how I calculate their 
matterporting cycle. I have my 
wristwatch with me and thus I 
am enabled to reckon the passing 
of time. 

What their exact purpose is in 
going to Earth, I do not know. 
My growing suspicion is that their 
much-vaunted superior science is 
a fraud and that their only supe- 
riority lies in the ability to mat- 
terport. One curious item may 
give a clue: They have ques-

tioned me regarding the Old Age 
Assistance programs of the sev- 
eral States. As I have said, they 
all look old. 

Can it be that elsewhere on 
this planet there is imprisoned 
some poor devil of a terrestrial 
printer or engraver, toiling under 
duress to produce forged birth 
certificates and other means of 
identification, to the fell purpose 
of allowing these aliens to live at 
ease at the financial expense of 
the already overburdened U.S. 
taxpayer? 

To whom shall I address my 
plea for help? To the Federal 
Government? But it has no offi- 
cial or even unofficial knowledge 
that this otherworldly race exists. 
The F.B.I.? But does matterport- 
ing under false pretenses to an- 
other planet constitute kidnaping 
across State lines? 

It seems the only thing I can 
do is to implore whichever den- 
tal practitioner reads these lines 
to communicate at once with the 
American Dental Association. I 
throw myself upon the mercy of 
my fellow professional men. 

Dentists and Dental Prostheti- 
cians! Beware of men with blue 
mouths and horny, edentulous 
ridges! Do not be deceived by 
flattery and false promises! Re- 
member the fate of that most mis- 
erable of men, Morris Goldpep- 
per, D.D.S., and, in his horrible 
predicament, help, oh, help him! 



A LONG silence followed the 
reading of this document. At 
length it was broken by Dr. Han- 
sen. 

“That brave man,” he said in 
a husky voice. “That brave little 
man.” 

“Poor Morris,” said Dr. Dan- 
bourge. “Think of him imprisoned 
on a far-off planet, slaving like a 
convict in a salt mine, so to speak, 
making false teeth for these inhu- 
man aliens, sending these mes- 
sages to us across the trackless 
void. It’s pitiful, and yet. Doctors, 
it is also a tribute to the indomi- 
table spirit of Man!” 

Dr. Weinroth moved his huge 
hands. “I’d like to get ahold of 
just one of those blue bastards,” 
he growled. 

Dr. Rorke cleared his throat. 
All present looked at their Presi- 
dent respectfully and eagerly. 

“I need hardly tell you. Doc- 
tors,” he said crisply, “that the 
A.D.A. is a highly conservative or- 
ganization. We do not go about 
things lightly. One such message 
we might ignore, but there have 
been eleven reported, all identical 
with the first. Even eleven such 
messages we might perhaps not 
consider, but when they come 
from a prominent scientist of the 
stature of Dr. Morris Goldpep- 
per — 

“Handwriting experts have pro- 

6ALAXY SCIENCE FACTION 



88 



nounced this to be his handwrit- 
ing beyond cavil of a doubt. 
Here”— he delved into a box — 
“are the eleven plates in question. 
Can any of you look at these 
clean lines and deny that they are 
the work of the incomparable 
Goldpepper?” 

The six other men looked at 
the objects, shook their heads. 

“Beautiful,” murmured Dr. 
Smith, “even in their broken state. 
Poems in plastic! M. G. couldn’t 
produce bad work if he tried!” 

Dr. Rorke continued. “Each re- 
port confirmed that the person 
who brought in the plate had a 
blue mouth and edentulous ridges, 
just as the message states. Each 
blue-mouthed patient exhibited 
the outward appearance of old 
age. And, gentlemen, of those 
eleven, no less than eight were re- 
ported from the State of Cali- 
fornia. Do you realize what that 
means? California offers the high- 
est amount of financial assistance 
to the elderly! Goldpepper’s sur- 
mise was right!” 

Dr. Hansen leaned forward. “In 
addition, our reports show that 
five of those eight are leaders in 
the fight against fluoridation of 
drinking water! It is my carefully 
considered belief that there is 
something in their physical make- 
up, evolved on another planet, 
which cannot tolerate fluorine 
even in minute quantities, be- 
cause they certainly — being al- 



ready toothless— wouldn’t be con- 
cerned with the prevention of de- 
cay.” 

Young Dr. McAllister took the 
floor. “We have checked with den- 
tal supply houses and detail men 
in the New York Metropolitan 
area and we found that large 
quantities of prosthetic supplies 
have been delivered to an other- 
wise unknown outfit — called the 
Echs Export Company — located 
not far north of the Washington 
Market! There is every reason to 
believe that this is the place Dr. 
Goldpepper mentioned. One of 
our men went there, found pres- 
ent only one man, in appearance 
an old man. Our representative 
feigned deafness, thus obliging 
this person to open his mouth and 
talk loudly. Doctors, he reports 
that this person has a blue mouth!” 

There was a deep intake of 
breath around the table. 

T^R. RORKE leaned forward 
and snapped off the tape re- 
corders. “This next is off the rec- 
ord. It is obvious, Doctors, that no 
ordinary methods will suffice to 
settle this case, to ensure the re- 
turn of our unfortunate colleague, 
or to secure the withdrawal of 
these extraterrestrial individuals 
from our nation and planet. I can- 
not, of course, officially endorse 
what might be termed ‘strong- 
arm’ methods. At the same time, I 
feel that our adversaries are not 



HEtPI I AM DR. MORRIS GOLDPEPPER 



89 



entitled to polite treatment. And 
obviously the usual channels of 
law enforcement are completely 
closed to us. 

“Therefore — and remember, no 
word of this must pass outside our 
circle — therefore I have commu- 
nicated something of this matter 
to Mr. Albert Annapollo, the well- 
known waterfront figure, who not 
long ago inaugurated the splendid 
Longshoremen’s Dental Health 
Plan. Mr. Annapollo is a some- 
what rough person, but he is 
nonetheless a loyal American. 

“We know now the Achilles 
heel of these alien creatures. It is 
fluorine. We know also how to 
identify them. And I think we 
may shortly be able to announce 
results. Meanwhile — ” he drew a 
slip of paper from his pocket— “it 
is already the first of the month in 
that quarter when the dental sup- 
plies are due to be transported — 
or matterported, as Dr. Goldpep- 
per terms it — to their distant des- 



tination. A large shipment is wait- 
ing to be delivered from the ware- 
houses of a certain wholesaler to 
the premises of the Echs Export- 
ing Company. I have had copies 
of this made and wrapped around 
each three-ounce bottle of Ellen- 
bogen’s Denture Stik-Phast. I pre- 
sume it meets with your ap- 
proval.” 

He handed it to Dr. Hansen, 
who, as the others present nodded 
in grimly emphatic approval, read 
it aloud. 

“From The American Dental 
Association, representing over 
45,000 registered dentists in the 
United States and its Territories, 
to Dr. Morris Goldpepper, wher- 
ever you may be: DO NOT DE- 
SPAIR! We are intent upon your 
rescue! We will bend every effort 
to this end! We shall fight the 
good fight!

Well, naturally Kaiser would 
transmit baby talk messages 
to his mother ship! He was — 



GROWING UP 
ON BIG MUDDY 

By CHARLES V. DE VET 



Illustrated by TURPIN 

K aiser stared at the tape 
in his hand for a long 
uncomprehending min- 
ute. How long had the stuff been 
coming through in this inane baby 
talk? And why hadn’t he noticed 
it before? Why had he had to 
read this last communication a 
third time before he recognized 
anything unusual about it? 

He went over the words again, 
as though maybe this time they’d 
read as they should. 

OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO 
TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM 
WARM. WHEN UM FEELS 
BETTER, LET USNS KNOW. 

SS II 



Kaiser let himself ease back in 
the pilot chair and rolled the tape 
thoughtfully between his fingers. 
Overhead and to each side, large 
drops of rain thudded softly 
against the transparent walls of 
the scout ship and dripped wea- 
rily from the bottom ledge to the 
ground. 

“Damn this climate!” Kaiser 
muttered irrelevantly. “Doesn’t it 
ever do anything here except 
rain?” 

His attention returned to the 
matter at hand. Why the baby 
talk? And why was his memory 
so hazy? How long had he been 
here? What had he been doing 
during that time? 



GROWING UP 



91 



Listlessly he reached for the 
towel at his elbow and wiped the 
moisture from his face and bare 
shoulders. The air conditioning 
had gone out when the scout ship 
cracked up. He’d have to repair 
the scout or he was stuck here for 
good. He remembered now that 
he had gone over the job very 
carefully and thoroughly, and had 
found it too big to handle alone — 
or without better equipment, at 
least. Yet there was little or no 
chance of his being able to find 
either here. 

Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser 
collected his thoughts, his memo- 
ries, and brought them out where 
he could look at them: 

The mother ship, Soscites II, 
had been on the last leg of its 
planet-mapping tour. It had 
dropped Kaiser in the one re- 
maining scout ship — the other 
seven had all been lost one way 
or another during the exploring 
of new worlds — and set itself 
into a giant orbit about this 
planet that Kaiser had named Big 
Muddy. 

The Soscites II had to main- 
tain its constant speed; it had no 
means of slowing, except to stop, 
and no way to start again once it 
did stop. Its limited range of 
maneuverability made it neces- 
sary to set up an orbit that would 
take it approximately one month, 
Earth time, to circle a pinpointed 
planet. And now its fuel was low. 

92 



Kaiser had that one month to 
repair his scout or be stranded 
here forever. 

That was all he could remem- 
ber. Nothing of what he had been 
doing recently. 

A small shiver passed through 
his body as he glanced once again 
at the tape in his hand. Baby 
talk. 

i~iNE thing he could find out: 
how long this had been going 
on. He turned to the communica- 
tor and unhooked the paper re- 
ceptacle on its bottom. It held 
about a yard and a half of tape, 
probably his last several messages 
— both those sent and those re-

The ship must have answered im- 
mediately, for the return message 
time was six hours later than his 
own, the minimum interval neces- 
sary for two-way exchange.

Sam, Kaiser knew, was the ship’s 
mechanical diagnostician. His re- 
port followed:

The ship’s next message read:

NITE. BUT SOMETHING 
STRANGE THERE. GIVE US 
ANYTHING MORE YOU

SS II 

His own reply perplexed Kaiser: 

LAST LETTER FUNNY. I 
NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY 
IS OO SENDING GARBLE 
TALK? DID USNS MAKE 
UP SECRET MESSAGES? 

SMOKY 



GROWING UP

The expedition, apparently, was 
as puzzled as he: 

WHAT’S THE MATTER, 
SMOKY? THAT LAST MES- 
SAGE WAS IN PLAIN TEH- 
RAN. NO REASON WHY 
YOU COULDN’T READ IT. 
AND WHY THE BABY 
TALK? IF YOU’RE SPOOF- 
ING, STOP. GIVE US MORE 
SYMPTOMS. HOW ARE 
YOU FEELING NOW? 

SS II 

The baby talk was worse on 
Kaiser’s next: 

TWAZY. WHAT FOR OO 
TENDING TWAZY LET- 
TERS? FINK UM CAN 
WEAD TWAZY LETTERS? 
SKIN ALL YELLOW NOW. 
COLD. COLD. CO 

The ship’s following communica- 
tion was three hours late. It was 
the last on the tap)e — the one 
Kaiser had read earlier. Appar- 
ently they decided to humor him. 

OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO 
TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM 
WARM. WHEN UM FEELS 
BETTER, LET USNS KNOW. 

SS II 

That was not much help. All it 
told him was that he had been 
sick.

He felt better now, outside of 
a muscular weariness, as though 
convalescing from a long illness. 
He put the back of his hand to 
his forehead. Cool. No fever any- 
way. 

He glanced at the clock-calen- 
dar on the instrument board and 
back at the date and time on the 
tape where he’d started his baby 
talk. Twenty hours. He hadn’t 
been out of his head too long. He 
began punching the communica- 
tor keys while he nibbled at a 
biscuit. 

SEEM TO BE FULLY RE- 
COVERED. FEELING FINE. 
ANYTHING NEW FROM 
SAM? AND HOW ABOUT 
THE DAMAGE TO SCOUT? 
GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU 
HAVE ON EITHER OR 
BOTH. 

SMOKY 

Kaiser felt suddenly weary. He 
lay on the scout’s bunk and tried 
to sleep. Soon he was in that 
phantasm land between sleep and 
wakefulness — he knew he was 
not sleeping, yet he did dream. 

It was the same dream he had 
had many times before. In it, he 
was back home again, the home 
he had joined the space service to 
escape. He had realized soon after 
his marriage that his wife, Helene, 
did not love him. She had mar- 
ried him for the security his pay 

GALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



check provided. And though it 
soon became evident that she, too, 
regretted her bargain, she would 
not divorce him. Instead, she had 
her revenge on him by persistent 
nagging, by letting herself grow 
fat and querulous, and by caring 
for their house only in a slovenly 
way. 

Her crippled brother had moved 
in with them the day they were 
married. His mind was as crip- 
pled as his body and he took an 
unhealthy delight in helping his 
sister torment Kaiser. 

1^ AISER came wide awake in 
a cold sweat. The clock 
showed that only an hour had 
passed since he had sent his last 
message to the ship. Still five 
more long hours to wait. He rose 
and wiped the sweat from his 
neck and shoulders and restlessly 
paced the small corridor of the 
scout. 

After a few minutes, he stopped 
pacing and peered out into the 
gloom of Big Muddy. The rain 
seemed to have eased off some. 
Not much more than a heavy 
drizzle now. 

Kaiser reached impulsively for 
the slicker he had thrown over 
a chest against one wall and put 
it on, then a pair of hip-high plas- 
tic boots and a plastic hat. He 
opened the door. The scout had 
come to rest with a slight tilt 
when it crashed, and Kaiser had 

GROWING UP 



to sit down and roll over onto his 
stomach to ease himself to the 
ground. 

The weather outside was nor- 
mal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, 
and warm. 

Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft 
mud before his feet reached solid 
ground. He half walked and half 
slid to the rear of the scout. Be- 
side the ship, the “octopus” was 
busily at work. Tentacles and an- 
tennae, extending from the yard- 
high box of its body, tested and 
recorded temperature, atmos- 
phere, soil, and all other pertinent 
planetary conditions. The octopus 
was connected to the ship’s com- 
municator and all its findings 
were being transmitted to the 
mother ship for study. 

Kaiser observed that it was 
working well and turned toward a 
wide, sluggish river, perhaps two 
hundred yards from the scout. 
Once there, he headed upstream. 
He could hear the pipings, and 
now and then a higher whistling, 
of the seal-people before he 
reached a bend and saw them. As 
usual, most were swimming in the 
river. 

One old fellow, whose choco- 
late-brown fur showed a heavy in- 
termixture of gray, was sitting on 
the bank of the river just at the 
bend. Perhaps a lookout. He 
pulled himself to his feet as he 
spied Kaiser and his toothless, 
hard-gummed mouth opened and 



95 



emitted a long whistle that might 
have been a greeting — or a warn- 
ing to the others that a stranger 
approached. 

The native stood perhaps five 
feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery 
body of a seal, and short, thick 
arms. Membranes connected the 
arms to his body from shoulder- 
pits to mid-biceps. The arms 
ended in three-fingered, thumbless 
hands. His legs also were short 
and thick, with footpads that 
splayed out at forty-five-degree 
angles. They gave his legs the ap- 
pearance of a split tail. About him 
hung a rank-fish smell that made 
Kaiser’s stomach squirm. 

The old fellow sounded a cheer- 
ful chirp as Kaiser came near. 
Feeling slightly ineffectual, Kaiser 
raised both hands and held them 
palm forward. The other chirped 
again and Kaiser went on toward 
the main group. 

^I^HEY had stopped their play 
•*- and eating as Kaiser ap- 
proached and now most of them 
swam in to shore and stood in the 
water, staring and piping. They 
varied in size from small seal- 
pups to full-grown adults. Some 
chewed on bunches of water 
weed, which they manipulated 
with their lips and drew into their 
mouths. 

They had mammalian charac- 
teristics, Kaiser had noted before, 
so it was not difficult to distin- 

96 



guish the females from the males. 
The proportion was roughly fifty- 
fifty. 

Several of the bolder males 
climbed up beside Kaiser and be- 
gan pawing his plastic clothing. 
Kaiser stood still and tried to 
keep his breathing shallow, for 
their odor was almost more than 
he could bear. One native smeared 
Kaiser’s face with an exploring 
paw and Kaiser gagged and 
pushed him roughly away. He was 
bound by regulations to display 
no hostility to newly discovered 
natives, but he couldn’t take much 
more of this. 

A yovmg female splashed water 
on two young males who stood 
near and they turned with shrill 
pipings and chased her into the 
water. The entire group seemed 
to lose interest in Kaiser and 
joined in the chase, or went back 
to other diversions of their own. 
Kaiser’s inspectors followed. 

They were a mindless lot, 
Kaiser observed. The river sup- 
plied them with an easy existence, 
with food and living space, and 
apparently they had few natural 
enemies. 

Kaiser walked away, following 
the long slow bend of the river, 
and came to a collection of per- 
haps two hundred dwellings built 
in three haphazard rows along the 
river bank. He took time to study 
their construction more closely 
this time. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




OROWING UP 



97 



They were all round domes, 
little more than the height of a 
man, built of blocks that ap- 
peared to be mud, packed with 
river weed and sand. How they 
were able to dry these to give 
them the necessary solidity, 
Kaiser did not know. He had 
found no signs that they knew 
how to use fire, and all apparent 
evidence was against their having 
it. They then had to have sun- 
light. Maybe it rained less during 
certain seasons. 

The domes’ construction was 
based on a series of four arches 
built in a circle. When the base 
covering the periphery had been 
laid, four others were built on and 
between them, and continued in 
successive tiers until the top was 
reached. Each tier thus furnished 
support for the next above. No 
other framework was needed. The 
final tier formed the roof. They 
made sound shelters, but Kaiser 
had peered into several and found 
them dark and dank — and as 
smelly as the natives themselves. 

The few loungers in the village 
paid little attention to Kaiser and 
he wandered through the irregu- 
lar streets until he became bored 
and returned to the scout. 

The Soscites II sent little that 
helped during the next twelve 
hours and Kaiser occupied his 
time trying again to repair the 
damage to the scout. 

The job appeared maddenly 



simply. As the scout had glided in 
for a soft landing, its metal bot- 
tom had ridden a concealed rock 
and bent inward. The bent metal 
had carried up with it the tube 
supplying the fuel pump and flat- 
tened it against the motor casing. 

/"OPENING the tube again 
would not have been difficult, 
but first it had to be freed from 
under the ship. Kaiser had tried 
forcing the sheet metal back into 
place with a small crowbar — the 
best leverage he had on hand — 
but it resisted his best efforts. He 
still could think of no way to do 
the job, simple as it was, though 
he gave his concentration to it 
the rest of the day. 

That evening, Kaiser received 
information from the Soscites II 
that was at least definite: 

SET YOURSELF FOR A 
SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FI- 
NALLY CAME THROUGH.

Kaiser’s reply was short and suc- 
cinct: 

WHAT THE HELL? 

SMOKY 

Soscites H’s next communication 
followed within twenty minutes 
and was signed by the ship’s doc- 
tor: 

JUST A FEW WORDS, 
SMOKY, IN CASE YOU’RE 
WORRIED. I THOUGHT I’D 
GET THIS OFF WHILE 
WE’RE WAITING FOR

WELFARE IS AS ESSEN- 
TIAL TO IT AS TO YOU. 
ALMOST CERTAINLY, IF

WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE 
YOU’VE HAD SO FAR WAS 
PROBABLY CAUSED BY

CULTY IN ADJUSTING IT- 
SELF TO ITS NEW ENVI- 
RONMENT. IN A WAY, I 
ENVY YOU. MORE LATER, 
WHEN WE FINISH WITH 
SAM. 

J. G. ZARWELL 



Kaiser did not answer. The news 
was so startling, so unforeseen, 
that his mind refused to accept 
the actuality. He lay on the 
scout’s bunk and stared at the 
ceiling without conscious atten- 
tion, and with very little clear 
thought, for several hours — until 
the next communication came in: 

WELL, THIS IS WHAT 
SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY.

SS II 

1^ AISER could imagine that 
most of the crew were not 
too concerned about the trouble 
he was in. He was not the gre- 
garious type and had no close 
friends on board. He had hoped 
to find the solitude he liked best 
in space, but he had been disap- 
pointed. True, there were fewer 
people here, but he was brought 
into such intimate contact with 
them that he would have been 
more contented living in a 
crowded city. 

His naturally unsociable nature 
was more irksome to the crew be- 
cause he was more intelligent and 
efficient than they were. He did 
his work well and painstakingly 
and was seldom in error. They 
would have liked him better had 
he been more prone to mistakes. 
He was certain that they re- 
spected him, but they did not like 
him. And he returned the dislike. 

The suggestion that he get some 
sleep might not be a bad idea. He 



hadn’t slept in over eighteen 
hours, Kaiser realized — and fell 
instantly asleep. 

The communicator had a mes- 
sage waiting for him when he 
awoke : 

SAM COULDN’T HELP US 
MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT 
AFTER RESEARCH AND 
MUCH DISCUSSION, WE 
ARRIVED AT THE FOL- 
LOWING TWO CONCLU- 
SIONS. 

FIRST. PHYSICAL PROP- 
ERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS

PROBABLY, A VIRUS

AGATION CHARACTERIS- 
TIC. IT UNDOUBTEDLY 
LIVES IN YOUR BLOOD

YOUR SYSTEM. 

SECOND, IT SEEMED TO 
US, AS IT MUST HAVE TO 
YOU, THAT THE SYMBI- 
OTE COULD ONLY KNOW 
WHAT YOU WANTED BY 
READING YOUR MIND. 
HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE 
DIFFERENTLY NOW. WE 
THINK THAT IT HAS 
SUCH CLOSE CONTACT 
WITH YOUR GLANDS AND 
THEIR SECRETIONS, 
WHICH STIMULATE EMO- 
TION, THAT IT CAN

EVEN MORE ACCURATELY 
THAN YOU YOURSELF

LIKES QUITE ACCU-

HAVE YOU TEST OUR 
THEORY. THERE ARE 
DOZENS OF WAYS. IF YOU 
ARE STUMPED AND NEED 
SUGGESTIONS, JUST LET 
US KNOW. WE AWAIT 
WORD FROM YOU WITH 
GREAT INTEREST. 

SS II 

By now, Kaiser had accepted 
what had happened to him. His 
distress and anxiety were gone 
and he was impatient to do what 
he could to establish better con- 
tact with his uninvited tenant. 
With eager anticipation, he set to 
thinking how it could be done. 
After a few minutes, an idea oc- 
curred to him. 

Taking a small scalpel from a 
medical kit, he made a shallow 
cut in his arm, just deep enough 
to bleed freely. He knew that the 
pain would supply the necessary 
glandular reaction. The cut bled a 
few slow drops — and as Kaiser 
watched, a shiny film formed and 
the bleeding stopped. 

That checked pretty well with 
the ship’s theory. 

Perhaps the symbiote had made 
his senses more acute. He tried 



closing his eyes and fingering sev- 
eral objects in the room. It 
seemed to him that he could de- 
termine the texture of each better 
than before, but the test was in- 
conclusive. Walking to the rear of 
the scout, he tried reading the 
printed words on the instrument 
panel. Each letter stood out sharp 
and clear! 

Kaiser wondered if he might 
not make an immediate, practical 
use of the symbiote’s apparent 
desire to help him. Concentrat- 
ing on the discomfort of the high 
humidity and exaggerating his 
own displeasure with it, he 
waited. The result surprised and 
pleased him. 

The temperature within the 
scout cabin seemed to lower, the 
moisture on his body vanished, 
and he was more comfortable 
than he had yet been here. 

As a double check, he looked at 
the ship’s thermometer. Tempera- 
ture 102, humidity 113 — just 
about the same as it had been on 
earlier readings. 

URING the next twenty-four 
hours, Kaiser and the mother 
ship exchanged messages at regu- 
lar six-hour intervals. In between, 
he worked at repairing the dam- 
aged scout. He had no more suc- 
cess than before. 

He tired easily and lay on the 
cot often to rest. Each time he 
seemed to drop off to sleep im-

mediately — and awake at the ex- 
act times he had decided on be- 
forehand. At first, despite the lack 
of success in straightening the 
bent metal of the scout bottom, 
there had been a subdued exhila- 
ration in reporting each new dis- 
covery concerning the symbiote, 
but as time passed, his enthusi- 
asm ebbed. His one really impor- 
tant problem was how to repair 
the scout and he was fast becom- 
ing discouraged. 

At last Kaiser could bear the 
futility of his efforts no longer. 
He sent out a tetse message to 
the Soscites II: 



TAKING SHORT TRIP TO 
ANOTHER LOCATION ON 
RIVER. HOPE TO FIND 
MORE INTELLIGENT NA- 
TIVES. COULD BE THAT 
THE SETTLEMENT I 
FOUND HERE IS ANALO- 
GOUS TO TRIBE OF MON-

THE CHANCE IS SMALL, 
BUT WHAT HAVE I TO 
LOSE? I CAN’T FIX SCOUT 
WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS, 
AND IF MY GUESS IS 
RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO 
GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT 
TO RETURN IN TEN OR 
TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE 
KEEP CONTACT WITH 
SCOUT. 

SMOKY 



Kaiser packed a mudsled with 
tent, portable generator and guard 
wires, a spare sidearm and ammu- 
nition, and food for two days. He 
had noticed that a range of high 
hills, which caused the bend in 
the river at the native settlement, 
seemed to continue its long curve, 
and he wondered if the hills 
might not turn the river in the 
shape of a giant horseshoe. He 
intended to find out. 

Wrapping his equipment in a 
plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out 
the doorway and tied it on the 
sled. He hooked a towline to a 
harness on his shoulders and be- 
gan his journey — in the opposite 
direction from the first native set- 
tlement. 

He walked for more than seven 
hours before he found that his 
surmise had been correct. And a 
second cluster of huts, and seal- 
people in the river, greeted his 
sight. He received a further pleas- 
ant surprise. This group was de- 
cidedly more advanced than the 
first! 

They were little different in ac- 
tual physical appearance; the 
change was mainly noticeable in 
their actions and demeanor. And 
their odor was more subdued, less 
repugnant. 

By signs, Kaiser indicated that 
he came in peace, and they seemed 
to understand. A thick-bodied 
male went solemnly to the river 
bank and called to a second, who 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dived and brought up a mouthful 
of weed. The first male took the 
weed and brought it to Kaiser. 
This was obviously a gesture of 
friendship. 

The weed had a white starchy 
core and looked edible. Kaiser 
cleaned part of it with his hand- 
kerchief, bit and chewed it. 

The weed had a slight iron 
taste, but was not unpalatable. He 
swallowed the mouthful and tried 
another. He ate most of what had 
been given him and waited with 
some trepidation for a reaction. 

A S DUSK fell, Kaiser set up his 
tent a few hundred yards 
back from the native settlement. 
All apprehension about how his 
stomach would react to the river 
weed had left him. Apparently it 
could be assimilated by his diges- 
tive system. Lying on his air mat- 
tress, he felt thoroughly at peace 
with this world. 

Once, just before dropping off 
to sleep, he heard the snuffling 
noise of some large animal out- 
side his tent and picked up a 
pistol, just in case. However, the 
first jolt of the guard-wire charge 
discou) aged the beast and Kaiser 
heard it shuffle away, making 
puzzled mewing sounds as it went. 

The next morning, Kaiser left 
off all his clothes except a pair 
of shorts and went swimming in 
the river. The seal-people were al- 
ready in the water when he ar- 



rived and were very friendly. 

That friendliness nearly re- 
sulted in disaster. The natives 
crowded around as he swam — 
they maneuvered with an otter- 
like proficiency — and often 
nudged him with their bodies 
when they came too close. He had 
difficulty keeping afloat and soon 
turned and started back. As he 
neared the river edge, a playful 
female grabbed him by the ankle 
and pulled him under. 

Kaiser tried to break her hold, 
but she evidently thought he was 
clowning and wrapped her warm 
furred arms around him and held 
him helpless. They sank deeper. 

When his breath threatened to 
burst from his lungs in a stream 
of bubbles, and he still could not 
free himself, Kaiser brought his 
knee up into her stomach and her 
grip loosened abruptly. He 
reached the surface, choking and 
coughing, and swam blindly to- 
ward shore until his feet hit the 
river bottom. 

As he stood on the bank, get- 
ting his breath, the natives were 
quiet and seemed to be looking at 
him reproachfully. He stood for a 
time, trying to think of a way to 
explain the necessity of what he 
had done, but there was none. He 
shrugged helplessly. 

There was no longer anything 
to be gained by staying here — if 
they had the tools he needed, he 
had no way of finding out or ask- 



GROWING UP 



103 



ing for them — and he packed and 
started back to the scout. 

Kaiser’s good spirits returned 
on his return journey. He had en- 
joyed the relief from the tedium 
of spending day after day in the 
scout, and now he enjoyed the 
exercise of pulling the mudsled. 
Above the waist, he wore only 
the harness and the large, soft 
drops of rain against his bare skin 
were pleasant to feel. 

When he reached the scout, 
Kaiser began to unload the sled. 
The tarpaulin caught on the edge 
of a runner and he gave it a tug 
to free it. To his amazement, the 
heavy sled turned completely 
over, spilling the equipment to 
the ground. 

Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and 
began replacing the spilled ar- 
ticles in the tarp. They felt ex- 
ceptionally light. He paused again, 
and suddenly his eyes widened. 

l^TOVING quickly to the door 
of the scout, he shoved his 
equipment through and crawled 
in behind it. He did not consult 
the communicator, as he custom- 
arily did on entering, but went 
directly to the warped place on 
the floor and picked up the crow- 
bar he had laid there. 

Inserting the bar between the 
metal of the scout bottom and the 
engine casing, he lifted. Nothing 
happened. He rested a minute 
and tried again, this time concen- 



trating on his desire to raise the 
bar. The metal beneath yielded 
slightly — but he felt the palms of 
his hands bruise against the lever. 

Only after he dropped the bar 
did he realize the force he had 
exerted. His hands ached and tin- 
gled. His strength must have been 
increased tremendously. With his 
plastic coat wrapped around the 
lever, he tried again. The metal 
of the scout bottom gave slowly 
— until the fuel pump hung free! 

Kaiser did not repair the tube 
immediately. He let the solution 
rest in his hands, like a package 
to be opened, the pleasure of its 
anticipation to be enjoyed as 
much as the final act. 

He transmitted the news of 
what he had been able to do and 
sat down to read the two mes- 
sages waiting for him. 

The first was quite routine:

The second report was not so rou- 
tine. Kaiser thought he detected 
a note of uneasiness in it. 

SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE 
ALL TIME AND EFFORT 
TO REPAIR OF SCOUT. IN- 
FORMATION ON SEAL- 
PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR 
OUR PURPOSES. 

SS II 

Kaiser did not answer either com- 
munication. His earlier report had 
covered all that he had learned 
lately. He lay on his cot and went 
to sleep. 

In the morning, another mes- 
sage was waiting: 

VERY PLEASED TO HEAR 
OF PROGRESS ON RE- 
PAIR OF SCOUT. COM- 



PLETE AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE AND RETURN 
HERE IMMEDIATELY. 

SS II 



1^ AISER wondered about the 
abrupt recall. Could the 
Soscites II be experiencing some 
difficulty? He shrugged the 
thought aside. If they were, they 
would have told him. The last 
notes had had more than just a 
suggestion of urgency — there ap- 
peared to be a deliberate con- 
cealing of information. 

Strangely, the messages’ indi- 
cated need for haste did not prod 
Kaiser. He knew now that the job 
could be done, perhaps in a few 
hours’ time. And the Soscites II 
would not complete its orbit of 
the planet for two weeks yet. 

Without putting on more than 
the shirt and trousers he had 
grown used to wearing, Kaiser 
went outside and wandered list- 
lessly about the vicinity of the 
ship for several hours. When he 
became hungry, he went back 
inside. 

Another message came in as he 
finished eating. This one was from 
the captain himself: 

WHY HAVE WE RE- 
CEIVED N O VERIFICA- 
TION OF LAST INSTRUC- 
TIONS? REPAIR SCQUT 
IMMEDIATELY AND RE- 



GROWING UP 



105 



TURN WITHOUT FUR- 
THER DELAY. THIS IS AN 
ORDER! 

H. A. HESSE, CAPT. 

Kaiser pushed the last of his meal 

— which he had been eating with 
his fingers — into his mouth, crum- 
pled the tape, wiped the grease 
from his hands with it and 
dropped it to the floor. 

He pondered mildly, as he 
packed his equipment, why he 
was disregarding the captain’s 
message. For some reason, it 
seemed too trivial for serious con- 
sideration. He placated his slightly 
uneasy conscience only to the ex- 
tent of packing the communicator 
in with his other equipment. It 
was a self-contained unit and he’d 
be able to receive messages from 
the ship on his trip. 

^ I ^HE tracks of his earlier jour- 
ney had been erased by the 
soft rain, and when Kaiser 
reached the river, he found that 
he had not returned to the village 
he had visited the day before. 
However, there were other seal- 
people here. 

And they were almost human! 
The resemblance was still not 
so much in their physical makeup 

— that was little changed from 
the first he had found — as in their 
obviously greater intelligence. 

This was mainly noticeable in 
their facile expressions as they 

106 



talked. Kaiser was even certain 
that he read smiles on their faces 
when he slipped on a particularly 
slick mud patch as he hurried to- 
ward them. Where the members 
of the first tribes had all looked 
almost exactly alike, these had 
very marked individual charac- 
teristics. Also, these had no odor 
— only a mild, rather pleasing 
scent. When they came to meet 
him, Kaiser could detect distinct 
syllabism in their pipings. 

Most of the natives returned to 
the river after the first ten min- 
utes of curious inspection, but two 
stayed behind as Kaiser set up his 
tent. 

One was a female. 

They made small noises while 
he went about his work. After a 
time, he understood that they 
were trying to give names to his 
paraphernalia. He tried saying 
“tent” and “wire” and “tarp” as 
he handled each object, but their 
piping voices could not repeat the 
words. Kaiser amused himself by 
trying to imitate their sounds for 
the articles. He was fairly suc- 
cessful. He was certain that he 
could soon learn enough to carry 
on a limited conversation. 

The male became bored after a 
time and left, but the girl stayed 
until Kaiser finished. She mo- 
tioned to him then to follow. 
When they reached the river 
bank, he saw that she wanted him 
to go into the water. 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"OEFORE he had time to de- 
cide, Kaiser heard the small 
bell of the commxmicator from 
the tent behind him. He stood un- 
decided for a moment, then re- 
turned and read the message on 
the tape: 

STILL ANXIOUSLY 
AWAITING WORD FROM 
YOU. 

IN MEANTIME, GIVE 
VERY CLOSE ATTENTION 
TO FOLLOWING. 

WE KNOW THAT THE 
SYMBIOTES MUST BE

OLOGY OF THE SEAL- 
PEOPLE. THERE IS EVERY

— TO BETTER FIT YOUR 
BODY TO ITS PRESENT 
ENVIRONMENT. 

THE DANGER, WHICH 
WE HESITATED TO MEN- 
TION UNTIL NOW— WHEN

LENCE — IS THAT IT CAN 
ALTER YOUR MIND ALSO.

OTHERS. ON THE CON- 
TRARY, YOU ARE BECOM- 
ING MORE LIKE THEM. 

DANGER ACUTE. RE- 
TURN IMMEDIATELY. RE- 
PEAT: IMMEDIATELY! 

SS II 

Kaiser picked up a large rock and 
slowly, methodically pounded the 
communicator into a flattened 
jumble of metal and loose parts. 

When he finished, he returned 
to the waiting girl on the river 
bank. She pointed at his plastic 
trousers and made laughing 
sounds in her throat. Kaiser re- 
turned the laugh and stripped off 
the trousers. They ran, still laugh- 
ing, into the water. 

Already the long pink hair that 
had been growing on his body 
during the past week was begin- 
ning to turn brown at the roots.

THE DOOR INTO SUMMER 
by Robert A. Heinlein. Double- 
day 8s Co., Inc., N. Y., $2.95 

¥ ET’S be thankful that we are 
now enjoying one of the pro- 
lific Mr. Heinlein’s most fruitful 
periods. Now we find Heinlein 
offering his version of The Sleeper 
Wakes. Leave it to him, however, 
to freshen up any old chestnut. 

He pulls a switch on the time 
of departure of his sleeper, who 
starts from the year 1970 via cold 
sleep, waking in 2000. Heinlein 
paints a detailed picture of both 
civilizations, so evocative that 

108 



1970 emerges clearly in the read- 
er’s mind as the old days, and 
pretty primitive at that. The hero 
is, like the author himself, an en- 
gineer. He has been bilked out of 
his 1970 inventions and faces an 
acclimatizing period in 2000 to 
learn the advances of the inter- 
vening years. 

The interim development of 
his stolen inventions, along with 
the appearance on the commer- 
cial market of old, nebulous ideas 
of his, both send him on a detec- 
tive search of two eras. 

Of course you’ll like Heinlein’s 
latest.

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION, edit- 
ed by Anthony Boucher. Double- 
day & Co., Inc., N. Y., $3.50 

T> OUCHER’S latest from F&SF 
is somewhat better balanced 
than his previous collection of 
giggles and cutenesses, and con- 
tains some fine yarns. Among 
these are Pohl’s shocker, “The 
Census Takers,” Sturgeon’s ditto, 
“And Now the News,” and Korn- 
bluth’s jolly “The Cosmic Ex- 
pense Account.” Most of the other 
stories are good, except for a very, 
very minor Bradbury. 

The two longest works, how- 
ever, Charles L. Fontenay’s “The 
Silk and the Song” and Ward 
Moore’s “No Man Pursueth,” are 
quite obviously used as bulk to 
make this a book rather than a 
pamphlet. If these were “the best” 
available, Boucher should have 
waited until he had better make- 
weights. 

THE LOST PLANET by Paul 
Dallas. The John C. Winston Co., 
Philadelphia, Toronto, $2.00. 

ALLAS has written a fairly 
standard juvenile space op- 
era that would have fared far bet- 
ter if heavy reliance had not been 
placed on unbelievable coinci- 
dences. 

Earth and Poseida, a planet 
whose location and environment 



are never satisfactorily explained, 
have reached the brink of war as 
the result of ultra-nationalistic ac- 
tivities of selfish individuals on 
each planet. The Poseidans are 
amphibious octopi and thorough- 
ly repellent in appearance to sen- 
sitive humans. 

Bill Hudson, recipient of a 
brand-new space-medical diploma, 
is treated to a post-graduate va- 
cation on Poseida by his chum’s 
old man, who happens to be Gen- 
eral Watkins, big-wig of Planqt 
Earth Forces. The very first day 
on Poseida, he saves the life of a 
young native who just happens, 
by the Lord Harry, to be the son 
of the planet’s ruler, no less. They 
become fast friends and discover 
that there isn’t much difference in 
mentality and outlook between 
the two races. 

One of the points of friction 
between the worlds is the disap- 
pearance of more than a score of 
experimental Earth ships on their 
initial test runs to exceed the 
speed of light. The Earth extrem- 
ists are convinced that the Po- 
seidans have a tentacle in it. 
While engaged in research on Po- 
seida, Hudson just happens, by 
all that’s lucky, to discover the 
antidote for the suspended anima- 
tion drug, something that thou- 
sands of scientists had been un- 
able to do. This has something to 
do with those ships.

further, but Dallas somewhat re-

T N THIS sequel to The Won- 
deriul Flight to the Mushroom 
Planet, David Topman and his 
buddy, Chuck Masterson, are vis- 
ited by a strange little person 
while spending the night in Tyco 
Bass’ house. Tyco, the wonderful 
little person who advertised for a 
spaceship built by boys, made the 
flight with them to the Mushroom 
Planet, really an invisible satellite 
of Earth, and then disappeared. 
The stranger reveals himself as 
Tyco’s cousin and also one of the 
Mushroom People. With his help, 
Tyco’s notes are deciphered and 
another ship and flight become 
possible. 

A Menace, however, in the per-

famous scientist creates plot prob- 
lems by stowing away and threat- 
ening to disclose the secret of the

THE LOST PYRAMID by M.

T AST month, Lost: A Moon. 

This month. The Lost Planet. 
Now a mislaid pyramid. A place 
for everything, and everything in 
its place, and this sort of thing 
wouldn’t keep happening. 

As an object lesson in deduc- 
tive archeology, this book stands 
by itself. Most of the famous finds 
have been the result of the ex- 
haustive study of sites, but Dr. 
Gonheim found his pyramid 
through dissatisfaction with the 
paucity of memorials dating from 
the Third Dynasty, 2800-2700 
B.C., the era just pre-dating the 
epoch of the Great Pyramid 
Builders. 

If you don’t mind the usual ar- 
cheological preoccupation with 
precise measurements, you’ll find 
this a satisfactory substitute for 
time travel, back to that incred- 
ible age of monumental egoma- 
niacs.

CLOCK WITHOUT HANDS by

A LTHOUGH books on ESP 
are appearing with increas- 
ing frequency, Edwin’s story has 
a ring of veracity that few others 
can equal. He offers more than 
usual documentation and presents 
his life history with such candor 
that his reader is swept along. He 
explains his gift as a natural com- 
pensation for his inadequacies, his 



introversion and melancholia dur- 
ing his abominably miserable 
childhood. One gathers that he 
has overcompensated his sensitiv- 
ity in later years by developing a 
sharp tongue and manner. 

He appeared on the British TV 
scene on Whafs My Line, stumped 
the experts and ran off with the 
honors in a blistering verbal ex- 
change with the acidulous panel- 
ist, Gilbert Harding. But leading 
up to this belated triumph is a 
lifetime of anguish. 

The Perceptive has virtually no 
control over his gift. Since the 
average life is cornposed of trivia, 
most clairvoyance is likewise triv- 
ial. As a result, there is no prac- 
tical vocation as yet for the poor 
Esper, Alfred Bester notwith- 
standing. Either he struggles along 
on the variety stage or he resorts, 
as Edwin confesses, to phony 
spiritualism. Despite earning a 
reasonable livelihood, disillusion- 
ment caused him to return to 
pure ESP and poverty. 

Unlike most authors of similar 
works, he remains unconvinced of 
life after death. Although ESP oc- 
casionally manifests itself to him 
in the guise of voices, he inter- 
prets it as a conversion to a nor- 
mal referent by the brain censor, 
not as spirit voices. 

If you have Started a para-psy- 
chology section of your library, 
this is a necessary inclusion.

THE DEATHS OF 

BEN BAXTER 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



The breath of an entire world literally 
hung upon whether he lived or died— and 
he infuriatingly refused to stay alive! 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



E dwin JAMES, the chief 
Programmer of Earth, had 
seated himself upon a lit- 
tle three-legged stool in front of 
the Probabilities Calculator. He 
was a small, spare man, impres- 
sively ugly, dwarfed by the great 
control board which soared a hun- 
dred feet above him. 

The steady hum. of the ma- 
chine, the slow drift of lights 
across the face of the panel. 



brought a sense of security which 
he recognized as false, but which 
soothed him all the same. He had 
just started to doze off when the 
pattern of lights changed. 

He sat up with a start and rub- 
bed his face. A paper tape inched 
from a slot in the panel. The 
Chief Programmer tore it off and 
scanned it. He nodded sourly to 
himself and walked quickly out 
of the room. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




113 



Fifteen minutes later, he en- 
tered the meeting room of the 
World Planning Council. Sum- 
moned there by his order, the five 
representatives of the Federated 
Districts of Earth were seated 
around the long table, waiting for 
him. 

There was a new member this 
year, Roger Beatty, from the 
Americas. He was tall and angu- 
lar and his bushy brown hair was 
just beginning to thin on top. He 
appeared eager, earnest and ill at 
ease. He was reading a procedural 
handbook and taking short, quick 
sniffs from his oxygen inhaler. 

James knew the other members 
well. Lan II from Pan-Asia, look- 
ing as small, wrinkled and inde- 
structible as ever, was engaged in 
intense conversation with large, 
blond Dr. Sveg from Europe. 
Miss Chandragore, beautiful and 
sleek, was playing her inevitable 
game of chess with Aaui of 
Oceania. 

James turned up the room’s 
oxygen supply and the members 
gratefully put away their inhalers. 

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” 
James said, taking his seat at the 
head of the table. “The current 
prediction just came through.” 

He took a notebook from his 
pocket and opened it 

“At our last meeting, we se- 
lected Alternate Probability Line 
3B3CC, which began in the year 
1832. The factor we were select- 

114 



ing for was the life of Albert Lev- 
insky. In the Main Historic Line, 
Levinsky died in 1935 of an auto- 
mobile accident By switching in- 
to Alternate Probability Line 
3B3CC, Levinsky avoided this ac- 
cident and lived to the age of 
sixty-two, completing his work. 
The result now, in our own time, 
in the opening up of Antartica.” 

“What about side - effects?” 
asked Janna Chandragore. 

“Those are discussed in the pa- 
per you will be given later. 
Briefly, though, 3B3CC adhered 
closely to the Historic Main Line. 
All important events remained 
constant. There were, of course, 
some effects which the prediction 
did not cover. They include an 
oil-well explosion in Patagonia, a 
flu epidemic in Kansas and an in- 
crease in smog over Mexico City.” 

“Have all injured parties been 
compensated?” Lan II wanted to 
know. 

“They have. And the coloniza- 
tion of Antartica is already be- 
gun.” 

The Chief Programmer im- 
folded the paper tape he had 
taken from the Probabilities Cal- 
culator. 

“But now we face a dilemma. 
As predicted, the Historic Main 
Line leads into unpleasant com- 
plications. But there are no good 
alternate lines to switch into!” 

The Members murmured to 
each other. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



James said, “Let me explain the 
situation.” He walked to a wall 
and pulled down a large chart. 
“The crisis-point occurs on April 
12, 1959, and our problem centers 
around an individual named Ben 
Baxter. The circumstances are as 
follows . .” 

‘P’ VENTS, by their very nature, 
evoke alternate possibilities, 
each of which produces its own 
continuum of history. In other 
spatial-temporal worlds, Spain 
lost at Lepanto, Normandy at 
Hastings, England at Waterloo. 

Suppose Spain had lost at 
Lepanto . 

Spain did, disastrously. And 
T urkish sea power, invincible, 
swept the Mediterranean of Euro- 
pean shipping. Ten years later, a 
Turkish fleet conquered Naples 
and paved the way for the Moor- 
ish invasion of Austria . 

In another time and space, that 
is. 

This speculation became ob- 
servable fact after the develop- 
ment of temporal selection and 
displacement. By 2103, Oswald 
Meyner and his associates were 
able to show the theoretical pos- 
sibility of Switching from the His- 
toric Main Line — so named for 
convenience — to alternate lines. 
Within definite limits, however. 

It would be impossible, for ex- 
ample, to Switch into a past 
where William of Normandy lost 

THE DEATHS OF SEN BAXTER 



the battle of Hastings. The world 
developing from that event would 
be too different, alien in every 
way. Switching was found pos- 
sible only into closely adjacent 
lines. 

The theoretical possibility be- 
came a practical necessity in 
2213. In that year, the Sykes-Ra- 
born Calculator at Harvard pre- 
dicted the complete sterilization 
of Earth’s atmosphere by the ac- 
cretion of radioactive by-prod- 
ucts. The process was irreversible 
and inevitable. It could be stopped 
only in the past, where the poi- 
soning had begun. 

The first Switch was made with 
the newly developed Adams-Holt- 
Maartens Selector. The World 
Planning Council chose a line 
which involved the early death of 
Vassily Ouchenko (and the oblit- 
eration of his erroneous radiation- 
damage theories). A large part of 
the subsequent poisoning was 
avoided, although at the cost of 
seventy-three lives — descendants 
of Ouchenko for whom no Switch- 
parents could be found. 

After that, there was no turning 
back. Line Switching became as 
necessary to the world as disease 
prevention. 

But the process had its limita- 
tions. A time had to come when 
no available line would be usable, 
when all futures looked unfavor- 
able. 

When that happened, the Plan- 



115 



ning Council was prepared to use 
more direct means. 

A ND those are the conse- 
quences for us,” Edwin 
James concluded. “That is the 
outcome if we allow the Main 
Historic Line to continue.” 

Lan II said, “Meaning that you 
predict serious trouble for Earth, 
Mr. Programmer.” 

“With regret, I do.” 

The Programmer poured him- 
self a glass of water and turned a 
page in his notebook. 

“Our pivotal point is Ben Bax- 
ter, who dies on April 12, 1957. 
He must live' at least another ten 
years for his work to have the de- 
sired effect upon world events. In 
that time, Ben Baxter will pur- 
chase Yellowstone National Park 
from the government. He will con- 
tinue to maintain it as a park, but 
will farm the trees. This enter- 
prise will be highly successful. He 
will buy other great tracts of land 
in North and South America. The 
Baxter heirs will be lumber kings 
for the next two hundred years 
and will own huge standings 
throughout the world. Due to 
their efforts, there will be great 
forests in the world, up to and in- 
cluding our own time. But if Bax- 
ter dies — ” 

James gestured wearily. “With 
Baxter dead, the forests will be 
cut before the governments of the 
world are fully aware of the con- 

lit 



sequences. Then comes the great 
blight of ’03, which the few re- 
maining woodlands cannot with- 
stand. And at last the present, 
with the natural carbon-dioxide- 
oxygen cycle disrupted by the de- 
struction of the trees, with all 
combustion devices banned, with 
oxygen inhalers a necessity merely 
to survive.” 

“We’ve started the forests 
again,” Aaui said. 

“It will be hundreds of years 
before they have grown to any 
significant size, even with forced 
growing methods. In the mean- 
time, the balance may become 
further upset. That is the impor- 
tance of Ben Baxter to us. He 
holds the key to the air we 
breathe!” 

“Very well,” said Dr. Sveg. “The 
Main Line, in which Baxter dies, 
is clearly unusable. But there are 
Alternates — ” 

“Many,” James said. “As usual, 
most of them cannot be selected. 
Counting the Main Line, we have 
a total of three choices. But, im- 
fortunately, each of them results 
in the death of Ben Baxter on 
April 12, 1959.” 

The Programmer wiped his 
forehead. “To be more specific, 
Ben Baxter dies on the afternoon 
of April 12, 1959, as a result of a 
business meeting with a man 
named Ned Brynne.” 

The new member, Roger Beat- 
ty, cleared his throat nervously. 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“This event takes place in all 
three probability worlds?” 

“Yes. In every one of them, 
Brynne is the cause of Baxter’s 
death.” 

Dr. Sveg came ponderously to 
his feet. “Formerly, this Council 
has avoided any direct interfer- 
ence with the existing lines of 
probability. But this situation 
seems to call for interference.” 

The council members nodded 
their agreement. 

“Let’s get down to cases,” said 
Aaui. “For the good of Earth, can 
this Ned Brynne be Switched 
Out?” 

“No,” replied the Programmer. 
“Brynne himself plays a vital role 
in our future. He has an option on 
almost a hundred square miles of 
forest. He needs Baxter’s backing 
to purchase it. If Brynne could be 
kept from that meeting with Bax- 
ter 

“How?” asked Beatty. 

“Take your pick,” James sug- 
gested. “Threats, persuasion, brib- 
ery, kidnaping — any means short 
of murder. We have three worlds 
to work in. If we can restrain 
Brynne in just one of them, our 
problem is solved.” 

“What would be our best meth- 
od?” asked Aaui. 

“Try several, a different one in 
each probability world,” said Miss 
Chandragore. “Our chances would 
be best that way. Shall we go 
ourselves?” 



“We are best suited for the 
job,” Edwin James said. “We 
know the factors involved. And 
politics gives one a certain skill 
in improvising — which will be 
sorely needed in this job. Each 
team will be absolutely on its 
own. There is no way for them to 
check on each other’s progress 
across the time lines.” 

“Each team then,” Dr. Sveg 
summed up, “will have to assume 
that the other teams fail.” 

“Probably with good reason,” 
James said wryly. “Let’s organize 
the teams and select our methods.” 

I 

N THE morning of April 12, 
1959, Ned Brynne awakened 
and washed and dressed. At 1:30 
that afternoon, he had an appoint- 
ment with Ben Baxter, president 
of Baxter Industries. Brynne’s en- 
tire future hinged upon the out- 
come of that meeting. If he could 
get the backing of the gigantic 
Baxter enterprises, and do so on 
favorable terms . 

Br 5 mne was a tall, darkly hand- 
some man of thirty-six. There was 
a hint of fanatic pride in his care- 
fully bland eyes, a suggestion of 
unreasoning stubbornness in his 
tightly held mouth. His move- 
ments had the controlled strength 
of a man who is constantly watch- 
ing and judging himself. 

He was almost ready to leave. 

iiy 



THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



He tucked a swagger stick under 
his arm and slipped a copy of 
Somerset’s American Peerage into 
his jacket pocket. He was never 
without that infallible guide. 

Finally he fixed to his lapel the 
golden sunburst decoration of his 
station. Brynne was a Chamber- 
lain, second class, and properly 
proud of the fact. Some people 
thought him too young for so ex- 
alted a position. But they had to 
agree that Brynne carried the pre- 
rogatives and requirements of his 
office with a dignity quite beyond 
his years. 

He locked his apartment and 
walked to the elevator. There was 
a small crowd waiting, mostly 
commoners, but two Equerries as 
well. All made way for him when 
the elevator came. 

“Pleasant day, Chamberlain 
Brynne,” the operator said as the 
car started down. 

Brynne inclined his head an 
inch in the usual response to a 
commoner. He was deep in 
thought about Ben Baxter. But at 
the corner of his eye, he noticed 
one of the occupants of the car, a 
tall, strongly built fellow with 
golden-brown Polynesian features 
and tilted dark eyes. Brynne won- 
dered what a man like that was 
doing in his apartment building. 
He knew the other tenants by 
sight, although their lower status 
naturally made them unworthy of 
his recognition. 

118 



The elevator reached the lobby 
and Brynne forgot about the Poly- 
nesian fellow. He had a lot on his 
mind today. There were some 
problems connected with Ben 
Baxter, problems he hoped to re- 
solve before the meeting. He 
strode outside, into a dismal gray 
April morning, and decided to go 
to the Prince Charles Coffee Shop 
for a late breakfast. 

It was 10:25 A.M. 

66 V(^HAT do you think?” Aaui 

“Looks like a tough customer,” 
said Roger Beatty. He inhaled 
deeply, savoring the rich air. It 
was a delightful luxury, breathing 
all the oxygen he wanted. In his 
time even the very wealthy 
turned down the oxygen tanks at 
night. 

They were following half a 
block behind Brynne. There was 
no losing Brynne’s tall, swagger- 
ing figure, even in New York’s 
morning rush. 

“He looked at you in the ele- 
vator,” Beatty said. 

“I know.” Aaui grinned. “Give 
him something to worry about.” 

“He doesn’t look like a worry- 
ing type,” Beatty said. “I wish we 
had more time.” 

Aaui shrugged. “This was the 
closest we could come to the 
event. Our next choice would 
have been eleven years ago. And 
we would still have to wait until 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



now before taking direct action.” 
“At least we’d know something 
about Brynne. He doesn’t look as 
though he’ll frighten easily.” 

“No, he doesn’t,” Aaui admit- 
ted. “But that’s the course of ac- 
tion we selected.” 

They continued to follow, no- 
ticing how the crowds parted to 
make way for Brynne, who 
marched straight ahead, not look- 
ing to right or left. Then it hap- 
pened. 

Brynne, his attention turned 
inward, collided with a portly, 
florid-faced man, who wore in his 
lapel the dazzling purple and sil- 
ver medallion of a First Order 
Crusader. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re 
going, imbecile?” the Crusader 
barked. 

T> RYNNE noticed the man’s 
rank, swallowed and mut- 
tered, “I beg your pardon, sir.” 
The Crusader wasn’t so easily 
placated. “Do you make a habit 
of bumping into your betters, 
sirrah?” 

“I do not,” Brynne said, his face 
growing red, fighting hard to re- 
strain his rage. A crowd of com- 
moners had gathered to watch. 
They ringed the brilliantly dressed 
men, grinning and nudging each 
other. 

“Then suppose you watch your- 
self!” the portly Crusader roared. 
“Stop cluttering the streets like a 



sleepwalker, before you are taught 
a lesson in manners!” 

Brynne said, with deadly quiet, 
“Sir, if you feel the necessity of 
giving me such a lesson, I should 
be pleased to meet you at a place 
of your choosing, with such weap- 
ons as you elect — ” 

“Me? Meet you?” the Crusader 
asked incredulously. 

“My rank permits it, sir.” 

“Your rank? You’re a good five 
degrees beneath me, you simple 
idiot! Enough of this or I’ll send 
my servants — who outrank you 
— to teach you a lesson in man- 
ners. I’ll remember your face, 
young man. Now get out of my 
way!” 

And with that, the Crusader 
pushed past him and stalked 
away. 

“Coward!” said Brynne, his face 
a mottled red. But he said it 
softly, and the commoners no- 
ticed. Brynne turned to them, his 
hands tightening on his swagger 
stick. Grinning cheerfully, the 
crowd broke up. 

Beatty said, “Dueling is permit- 
ted here?” 

Aaui nodded. “The legal prece- 
dent came in 1804, when Alexan- 
der Hamilton killed Aaron Burr 
in a duel.” 

“I guess we’d better get to 
work,” Beatty said. “But I wish 
we had more equipment.” 

“We took all we could carry. 
Let’s get on with it.” 



THE DEATHS OF SEN BAXTER 



119 



¥NSIDE the Prince Charles Cof- 
fee Shop, Brynne sat at a table 
far in the rear. His hands were 
trembling; with an effort, he con- 
trolled them. Damn that First 
Order Crusader! Lousy, overbear- 
ing blowhard! But would he ac- 
cept a duel? No, of course not. 
Had to hide behind the privileges 
of his station. 

Rage was rising in Brynne, 
black and ominous. He should 
have killed the man and the 
blazes with the consequences! The 
blazes with everything! No man 
could step on him that way . 

Stop it, he told himself. There 
was nothing he could do about it. 
He had to think about Ben Bax- 
ter and the all-important meet- 
ing. Looking at his watch, he saw 
it was nearly eleven o’clock. In 
two and a half hours, he would be 
in Baxter’s office and — 

“Your order, sir?” a waiter 
asked him. 

“Hot chocolate, toast and a 
poached egg.” 

“French fries?” 

“If I wanted French fries, I’d 
have told you!” Brynne shouted. 

The waiter went pale, gulped, 
said, “Yes, sir, sorry, sir,” and hur- 
ried off. 

Now, Brynne thought. I’m re- 
duced to yelling at commoners. 
Control — I must get myself un- 
der control. 

"Ned Brynne!” 

Brynne started and looked 



around. He had distinctly heard 
someone whisper his name. But 
there was no one within twenty 
feet of him. 

“Brynne!” 

“What is this?” Brynne mut- 
tered in unwilling reply. “Who’s 
speaking?” 

“You’re nervous, Brynne, los- 
ing control of yourself. You need 
a rest, a vacation, a change.” 

Brynne went dead whif;e under 
his tan and looked around the 
cafe. It was almost empty. There 
were three old ladies near the 
front. Beyond them he could see 
two men, talking together ear- 
nestly. 

“Go home, Brynne, and get 
some rest. Take some time off 
while you can” 

“I have an important business 
appointment,” Brynne said, his 
voice shaky. 

“Business before sanity,” the 
voice pointed out mockingly. 

“Who’s talking to me?” 

“What makes you think some- 
one is talking to you?” the voice 
asked silkily. 

“You mean I’m talking to my- 
self?” 

“You should know.”' 

“Your egg, sir,” the waiter said. 

‘What?” Brynne roared. 

The waiter stepped hastily 
back, slopping hot chocolate into 
the saucer. “Sir?” he quavered. 

“Don’t creep around that way, 
idiot.” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The waiter looked at Brynne 
incredulously, deposited the food 
and fled. Brynne stared after him 
suspiciously. 

“You are in no condition to see 
anyone” the voice told him. “Go 
home, get into bed, take a pill, 
sleep, heal!” 

“But what’s the matter? Why?” 

“Because your sanity is at stake! 
This external voice is your mind’s 
last frantic attempt at stability. 
You can’t afford to ignore this 
warning, Brynne!” 

“It can’t be true!” protested 
Brynne. “I’m sane. I’m — ” 

“Beg pardon, sir,” said a voice 
at his elbow. 

Brynne whirled, prepared to 
chastise this further intrusion on 
his privacy. He saw the blue uni- 
form of a policeman looming over 
him. The man was wearing the 
white shoulder epaulets of a 
Noble Lieutenant. 

TJRYNNE swallowed hard and 
said, “Anything wrong, Offi- 
cer?” 

“Sir, the waiter and manager 
tell me you are talking to your- 
self and threatening violence.” 

“Preposterous,” snapped Brynne. 

“Ifs true! It’s true! Yotfre go- 
ing crazy!” the voice Screamed in 
his head. 

Brynne stared at the great 
square bulk of the policeman. 
Surely he heard the voice! But 
apparently the Noble Lieutenant 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



didn’t, for he continued to look 
somberly down at him. 

“It’s not true,” Brynne said, 
feeling secure in staking his word 
against a commoner’s. 

“I heard you myself,” the Noble 
Lieutenant said. 

“Well, sir, it’s this way,” Brynne 
began, choosing his words with 
care. “I was — ” 

The voice shrieked in his head, 
“Tell him to go to hell, Brynne! 
Who’s he to question you? Who’s 
anyone to question you? Hit him! 
Blast him! Kill him! Destroy 
him!” 

Brynne said, through the bar- 
rage of noise in his head, “I was 
talking to myself, perfectly true. 
Officer. I frequently think out 
loud. It helps me to organize my 
thoughts.” 

The Noble Lieutenant gave a 
half nod. “But you offered vio- 
lence, sir, at no provocation.” 

“No provocation! I ask you, sir, 
are cold eggs no provocation? Are 
limp toast and spilled chocolate 
no provocation?” 

The waiter, called over, insisted, 
“Those eggs were hot — ” 

“They were not and that is all. 
I do not expect to sit here and 
argue a point of fact with a com- 
moner.” 

“Quite right,” the Noble Lieu- 
tenant said, nodding emphatically 
now. “But might I ask you, sir, to 
curb your anger somewhat, even 
though it may be perfectly justi- 

121 



fied? Not too much can be ex- 
pected of commoners, after all.” 

“I know,” Brynne agreed. “By 
the way, sir — the purple edging 
on your epaulets — are you related 
to O’Donnel of Moose Lodge, by 
any chance?” 

“My third cousin on my moth- 
er’s side,” said the Noble Lieuten- 
ant, looking intently now at 
Brynne’s sunburst medallion. “My 
son has entered the Chamberlain 
Halls as a probationary. A tall 
boy named Callahan.” 

“I will remember the name,” 
Brynne promised. 

“The eggs were hot!” said the 
waiter. 

“Don’t dispute the word of a 
gentleman,” ordered the officer. 
“It could get you into serious 
trouble. Pleasant day to you, sir.” 
The Noble Lieutenant saluted 
and left. 

Brynne paid and left shortly 
after him. He deposited a sizable 
tip for the waiter, but determined 
never to come into the Prince 
Charles again. 

?<J|>ESOURCEFUL fellow,” 
Aaui said bitterly, putting 
the tiny microphone back in his 
pocket. “For a moment, I thought 
we had him.” 

“We would have, if he’d had 
any latent doubts about his san- 
ity. Well, now for something more 
direct. Got the equipment?” 

Aaui took two pairs of brass 



knuckles out of his pocket and 
handed one to Beatty. 

“Try not to lose it,” he said. 
“We’re supposed to return it to 
the Primitive Museum.” 

“Right. It fits over the fist, 
doesn’t it? Oh, yes, I see.” 

They paid and hurried out. 

* 

Brynne decided to take a stroll 
along the waterfront to quiet his 
nerves. The sight of the great 
ships lying calm and steadfast in 
their berths never failed to soothe 
him. He walked steadily along, 
trying to reason out what had 
happened to him. 

Those voices in his head . 

Was he really losing his grip? 
An uncle on his mother’s side had 
spent his last years in an institu- 
tion. Involutional melancholia. 
Was there some explosive hidden 
factor at work in him? 

He stopped and looked at the 
bow of a great ship. The Theseus . 

Where was it going? Italy, per- 
haps. He thought of blue skies, 
brilliant sunshine, wine and relax- 
ation. Those things would never 
be his. Work, frantic effort, that 
was the life he had set for him- 
self. Even if it meant losing his 
mind, he would continue to labor 
under the iron-gray skies of New 
York. 

But why, he asked himself. He 
was moderately well off. His busi- 
ness could take care of itself. 
What was to stop him from 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



boarding that ship, dropping 
evers^thing, spending a year in the 
sun? 

Excitement stirred in him as he 
realized that nothing was stop- 
ping him. He was his own man, a 
determined, strong man. If he had 
the guts to succeed in business, he 
also had the guts to leave it, to 
drop everything and go away. 

“To hell with Baxter!” he said 
to himself. 

His sanity was more important 
than anything. He would board 
that ship, right now, wire his as- 
sociates from sea, tell them — 

^I^WO men were walking toward 
him down the deserted street. 
He recognized one by his golden- 
brown Polynesian features. 

“Mr. Brynne?” inquired the 
other, a rangy fellow with a shock 
of brown hair. 

“Yes?” said Brynne. 

Without warning, the Polyne- 
sian threw both arms around him, 
pinning him, and the shock-haired 
man swung at him with a fist that 
glinted golden! 

Brynne’s keyed-up nerves re- 
acted with shattering speed. He 
had been a Knight Rampant dur- 
ing the Second World Crusade. 
Now, years later, all the reaction 
patterns were still there. He 
ducked the shock-haired man’s 
blow and drove his elbow into the 
Polynesian’s stomach. The man 
grunted and his grip relaxed for a 

THE DEATHS OF DEN BAXTER 



second. Brynne broke free. 

He chopped at the Polynesian 
with the back of his hand, hitting 
the nerve trunk in the throat. The 
man went down, gasping for 
breath. At the same time, the 
shock-haired man was on him, 
raining brass-knuckled blows. 

Brynne lashed out, missed, 
caught a solid punch in the solar 
plexus. He fought for air. Black- 
ness began edging into the periph- 
ery of his vision. He was hit again 
and went down, fighting for con- 
sciousness. Then his opponent 
made a mistake. 

The shock-haired man tried to 
finish him with a kick, but he 
didn’t know how to kick. Brynne 
caught his foot and jerked. Off 
balance, the man crashed to the 
pavement, striking his head. 

Brynne staggered to his feet, 
breathing hard. The Polynesian 
was sprawled in the road, his face 
purple, making feeble swimming 
movements with his arms and 
legs. The other man lay motion- 
less, blood seeping slowly through 
his hair. 

He should report this incident 
to the police, Brynne thought. But 
suppose he had killed the shock- 
haired man? He would be held on 
a manslaughter charge, at least. 
And the Noble Lieutenant would 
report his earlier irrational be- 
havior. 

He looked around. No one had 
witnessed the incident. It was 

123 



best to simply walk away. Let his 
assailants report it, if they wanted 
to. 

Things were falling into place 
now. These men must have been 
hired by one of his many business 
competitors, men who were also 
trying for an affiliation with Ben 
Baxter. Even the voice in his head 
might have been a clever trick. 

Well, let them try to stop him! 
Still breathing heavily, he began 
walking toward Ben Baxter’s 
office. 

All thoughts of a cruise to Italy 
were gone now. 

A RE you all right?” a voice 
asked from somewhere up 

above. 

Beatty returned slowly to con- 
sciousness. For a short, alarmed 
while, he thought he had a frac- 
tured skull. But, touching it gent- 
ly, he decided it was still in one 
piece. 

“What did he hit me with?” he 
asked. 

“The pavement, I think,” Aaui 
said. “Sorry I couldn’t help. He 
put me out of action pretty early.” 

Beatty sat up, clutching his 
aching head. “What a fighter!” 

“We underestimated him,” said 
Aaui. “He must have had some 
kind of training. Do you think 
you can walk?” 

“I think so,” Beatty said, letting 
Aaui help him to his feet. “What 
time is it?” 

124 



“Nearly one o’clock. His ap- 
pointment’s at one-thirty. Maybe 
we can stop him at Baxter’s 
office.” 

In five minutes, they caught a 
taxi and sped to Baxter’s building. 

The receptionist was young and 
pretty, and she stared at them 
open-mouthed. They had man- 
aged to clean up some of the dam- 
age in the taxi, but what remained 
looked pretty bad. Beatty had an 
improvised bandage over his head 
and Aaui’s complexion bordered 
on green. 

“What do you want?” the re- 
ceptionist asked. 

“I believe Mr. Baxter has a 
one-thirty appointment with Mr. 
Brynne,” said Aaui in his most 
businesslike tone. 

“Yes 

The wall clock read one-seven- 
teen. Aaui said, “We must see Mr. 
Brynne before he goes in. It’s very 
urgent. So if you don’t mind, we’ll 
wait here for him.” 

“You can wait,” the girl said. 
“But Mr. Brynne has already 
gone in.” 

“But it isn’t one-thirty yet!” 

“Mr. Brynne was early. Mr. 
Baxter decided to see him at 
once.” 

“I must speak to him,” Aaui 
said. 

“I have orders not to disturb 
them.” The girl looked frightened 
and her finger hovered over a but- 
ton on her desk. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Aaui knew that the button 
would probably summon help. A 
man like Baxter would have pro- 
tection near at all times. The 
meeting was taking place now, 
and he didn’t dare interfere. Per- 
haps his actions had changed the 
course of events. It seemed likely. 
The Brynne in that office was a 
different man, a man altered by 
his adventures of the morning. 

“It’s all right,” Aaui said to the 
receptionist. “We’ll just sit here 
and wait.” 

13 EN BAXTER was short, solid, 
bull-chested. He was totally 
bald and his eyes, behind gold 
pince-nez, were expressionless. His 
business suit was severe, and af- 
fixed to the lapel was the small 
ruby-and-pearls emblem of the 
Wall Street House of Lords. 

For half an hour, Brynne had 
talked, spread papers on Baxter’s 
desk, quoted figures?, mentioned 
trends, predicted movements. He 
was perspiring anxiously now, 
waiting for a word out of Baxter. 

“Hmm,” said Ben Baxter. 

Brynne waited. His temples 
were pounding with a steady, dull 
ache and he was having trouble 
with the tight knots in his stom- 
ach. It was years since he had 
fought in anger; he wasn’t used to 
it. He hoped he could control 
himself until the meeting was 
over. 

“The terms you request,” said 



Baxter, “are just short of prepos- 
terous.” 

“Sir?” 

“Preposterous was the word, 
Mr. Brynne. You are, perhaps, 
hard of hearing?” 

“No,” said Brynne. 

“Excellent. These terms you 
present might be suitable for ne- 
gotiation between two companies 
of equal holdings. But such is not 
the case, Mr. Brynne. It amounts 
to presumption that a company of 
your size should offer such terms 
to Baxter Enterprises.” 

Brynne’s eyes narrowed. He had 
heard about Baxter’s reputation 
for in-fighting. This was not per- 
sonal insult, he reminded himself. 
It was the kind of business ma- 
neuver that he himself had often 
used. It must be .dealt with as 
such. 

“Let me point out,” Brynne 
said, “the key nature of this forest 
area I have an option on. With 
sufficient capitalization, we could 
extend the holding enormously, 
to say nothing — ” 

“Hopes, dreams, promises,” Bax- 
ter sighed. “You may have some- 
thing worth while. As yet, it is in- 
adequately demonstrated.” 

This is business, Brynne re- 
minded himself. He does want to 
back me — I can tell. I expected 
to come down in the bargaining. 
Naturally. All he’s doing is beat- 
ing down the terms. Nothing per- 
sonal . 



THE DEATHS OF SEN BAXTER 



125 



But too much had happened to 
Brynne in one day. The red-faced 
Crusader, the voice in the restau- 
rant, his short-lived dream of free- 
dom, the fight with the two men 
— he knew he couldn’t take much 
more. 

“Suppose, Mr. Brynne,” said 
Baxter, “you make a more reason- 
able offer. One in keeping with 
the modest and subsidiary status 
of your holdings.” 

He’s testing me, Brynne thought. 
But it was too much. He was as 
nobly born as Baxter; how dare 
the man treat him this way? 

“Sir,” he said through numb 
lips, “I take exception.” 

“Eh?” said Baxter, and Brynne 
thought he glimpsed amusement 
in the cold eyes. “What do you 
take exception to?” 

“Your statements, sir, and the 
maimer in which you say them. I 
suggest you apologize.” 

STANDING up stiffly, Brynne 
^ waited. His head was pound- 
ing inhumanly now and his stom- 
ach refused to unknot itself. 

“I see nothing for which to 
apologize, sir,” said Baxter. “And 
I see no reason to deal with a 
man who cannot keep personali- 
ties out of a business discussion.” 
He’s right, Brynne thought. I’m 
the one who should apologize. But 
he could not stop. Desperately he 
said, “I warn you— apologize, sir!” 
“We can do no business this 

126 



way,” said Baxter. “And frankly, 
Mr. Brynne, I had hoped to do 
business with you. I will try to 
speak in a reasonable manner, if 
you will try to react in an equally 
reasonable marmer. I ask you to 
withdraw your request for an 
apology and let us get on.” 

“I can’t!” Brynne said, wishing 
passionately he could. “Apologize, 
sir!” 

Baafter stood up, short and pow- 
erfully built. He stepped out from 
behind the desk, his face dark 
with anger. “Get out of here then, 
you insolent yoimg dog! Get out 
or I’ll have you thrown out, you 
hot-headed fool! Get out!” 

Br5mne, wishing to apologize, 
thought of the red-faced Crusader, 
the waiter, his two assailants. 
Something snapped in him. He 
lashed out with all his strength, 
the weight of his body behind the 
blow. 

It caught Baxter full in the 
neck and slammed him against 
the desk. Eyes glazed, Baxter 
slumped to the floor. 

“I’m sorry!” Brynne cried. “I 
apologize! I apologize!” 

He knelt beside Baxter. “Are 
you all right, sir? I’m truly sorry. 
I apologize . .” 

A part of his mind, coldly func- 
tioning, told him that he had been 
caught in an unresolvable ambiv- 
alence. His need for action had 
been as strong as his need to apol- 
ogize. And so he had solved the 

GALAXY SCIENCE EICTION 



dilemma by trying to do both 
things, in the usual ambivalent 
muddle. He had struck — then 
apologized. 

“Mr. Baxter?” he called in 
alarm. 

Ben Baxter’s features were con- 
gested and blood drooled from a 
corner of his mouth. Then Brynne 
noticed that Baxter’s head lay at 
a queer angle from his body. 

“Oh . .” Brynne said. 

He had served three years with 
the Knights Rampant. It was not 
the first broken neck he had seen. 

II 

O N THE morning of April 12, 
1959, Ned Brynne awakened 
and washed and dressed. At 1:30 
that afternoon, he had an appoint- 
ment with Ben Baxter, the presi- 
dent of Baxter Industries. 
Brynne’s entire future hinged 
upon the outcome of that meet- 
ing. If he could get the backing of 
the gigantic Baxter enterprises, 
and do so on favorable terms . 

Brynne was a tall, darkly hand- 
some man of thirty-six. There was 
a hint of deep gentleness in his 
carefuly bland eyes, a suggestion 
of uncompromising piety in his 
expressive mouth. His movements 
had the loose grace of an unself- 
conscious man. 

He was almost ready to leave. 
He tucked a prayer stick under 
his arm and slipped a copy of 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



Norsted’s Guide to the Gentle 
Way into his pocket. He was 
never without that infallible guide. 

Finally he fixed to his lapel the 
silver moon decoration of his sta- 
tion. Brynne was a Restrainer, 
second class, of the Western Bud- 
dhist Congregation, and he al- 
lowed himself a carefully re- 
strained pride over the fact. Some 
people thought him too young for 
lay-priestly duties. But they had 
to agree that Brynne carried the 
prerogatives and requirements of 
his office with a dignity quite be- 
yond his years. 

He locked his apartment and 
walked to the elevator. There was 
a small crowd waiting, mostly 
Western Buddhists, but two La- 
maists as well. All made way for 
him when the elevator came. 

“Pleasant day. Brother Brynne,” 
the operator said as the car started 
down. 

Brynne inclined his head an 
inch in the usual modest response 
to a member of the flock. He was 
deep in thought about Ben Bax- 
ter. But at the corner of his eye, 
he noticed one of the occupants of 
the car, a slim, beautiful, black- 
haired woman with a piquant 
golden face. Indian, Brynne 
thought, wondering what a woman 
like that was doing in his apart- 
ment building. He knew the other 
tenants by sight, though, of 
course, he would not be sufficient- 
ly immodest to recognize them. 

127 



The elevator reached the lobby 
and Brynne forgot about the In- 
dian woman. He had a lot on his 
mind today. There were some 
problems connected with Ben 
Baxter, problems he hoped to re- 
solve before the meeting. He 
stepped outside, into a dismal 
gray April morning, and decided 
to go to the Golden Lotus Coffee 
Shop for a late breakfast. 

It was 10:25 a.m. 

44T COULD stay here and 
breathe this air forever!” 
said Janna Chandragore. 

Lan II smiled faintly. “Perhaps 
We can breathe it in our own age. 
How does he seem to you?” 

“Smug and over-righteous,” she 
Said. They were following half a 
block behind Brynne. There was 
no losing Brynne’s tall, stooped 
figure, even in New York’s morn- 
ing rush. 

“He absolutely stared at you in 
the elevator,” said Lan II. 

“I know.” She smiled. “He’s 
rather nice-looking, don’t you 
think?” 

Lan II raised both eyebrows, 
but didn’t comment. They contin- 
ued to follow, noticing how the 
crowds parted out of respect for 
Brynne’s rank. Then it happened. 

Brynne, his attention turned in- 
ward, collided with a portly, 
florid-faced man who wore the 
yellow robe of a Western Bud- 
dhist priest. 

138 



“My apologies for violating 
your meditation. Young Brother,” 
said the priest. 

“My fault entirely. Father,” 
Brynne said. “For it is written, 
‘Youth should know its foot- 
steps.’ ” 

The priest shook his head. “In 
youth,” he said, “resides the dream 
of the future; and age must make 
way.” 

“Age is our guide and signposts 
along the Way,” Brynne objected 
humbly but insistently. “The writ- 
ings are clear on the point.” 

“If you accept age,” said the 
priest, his lips tightening slightly, 
“then accept the dictum of age: 
youth must forge ahead! Kindly 
do not contradict me. Dear 
Brother.” 

Brynne, his eyes carefully 
bland, bowed deeply. The priest 
bowed in return and the men con- 
tinued their separate ways. 

Brynne walked more quickly, 
his hands tight on his prayer 
stick. Just like a priest — using his 
age as a support for arguments in 
favor of youth. There were some 
strange contradictions in Western 
Buddhism, but Brynne did not 
care to think about them at the 
moment. 

He went into the Golden Lotus 
Coffee Shop and sat down at a 
table far in the rear. He fingered 
the intricate carvings on his pray- 
er stick and felt anger wash away 
from him. Almost immediately, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he regained that serene and un- 
ruffled union of mind with emo- 
tions so vital to the Gentle Way. 

Now was the time to think 
about Ben Baxter. After all, a 
man had to perform his temporal 
duties as well as his religious 
ones. Looking at his watch, he saw 
it was nearly eleven o’clock. In 
two and a half hours, he would be 
in Baxter’s office and — 

“Your order, sir?” a waiter 
asked him. 

“A glass of water and some 
dried fish, if you please,” said 
Brynne. 

“French fries?” 

“Today is Visya. It is not al- 
lowed,” Brynne murmured softly. 

The waiter went pale, gulped, 
said, “Yes, sir, sorry, sir,” and hur- 
ried off. 

T SHOULDN’T have made him 
-*■ feel ridiculous, thought Brynne. 
I should simply have refused the 
French fries. Should I apologize 
to the man? 

He decided it would simply 
embarrass him. Resolutely Brynne 
put the thought out of his mind 
and concentrated on Ben Baxter. 
With Baxter’s power behind the 
forest area Brynne had optioned, 
and its potential, there was no 
telling — 

He became conscious of a dis- 
turbance at a nearby table. He 
turned and saw a golden-featured 
woman weeping bitterly into a 

THE DEATHS OF SEN BAXTER 



tiny lace handkerchief. She was 
the woman he had seen earlier in 
his apartment building. With her 
was a small, wizened old man, 
who was trying in vain to console 
her. 

.As the woman wept, she cast a 
despairing glance at Brynne. 
There was only one thing a Re- 
strainer could do under the cir- 
cumstances. 

He walked over to their table. 
“Excuse the intrusion,” he said. “I 
couldn’t help notice your distress. 
Perhaps you are strangers in the 
city. Can I help?” 

“We are past help!” the woman 
wailed. 

The old man shrugged his 
shoulders fatalistically. 

Brynne hesitated, then sat 
down at their table. “Tell me,” he 
begged. “No problem is unsolv- 
able. It is written that there is a 
path through all jungles and a 
trail over the steepest mountains.” 

“Truly spoken,” the old man as- 
sented. “But sometimes the feet 
of Man cannot reach the trail’s 
end.” 

“At such times,” Brynne re- 
plied, “each helps each and the 
deed is done. Tell me your trou- 
ble. I will serve you in any way 
I can.” 

In actual fact, this was more 
than a Restrainer was required to 
do. Total service was the obliga- 
tion of higher-ranking priests. But 
Brynne was swept away by the 

129 



woman’s need and beauty, and 
the words were out before he 
could consider them. 

“ ‘In the heart of a young man 
is strength,’ ” quoted the old man, 
“ ‘and a staff for weary arms.’ But 
tell me, sir, are you a believer in 
religious toleration?” 

“Absolutely!” said Brynne. “It 
is one of the essential tenets of 
Western Buddhism.” 

“Very well. Then know, sir, 
that my daughter Janna and I are 
from Lhagrama in India, where 
we serve the Daritria Incarnation 
of the Cosmic Function. We came 
here to America hoping to found 
a small temple. Unfortunately, 
the schismatics of the Marii In- 
carnation have arrived before us. 
My daughter must return to her 
home. But our lives are threat- 
ened momentarily by these Marii 
fanatics, who are sworn to stamp 
out the Daritria faith.” 

“But your lives can’t be in dan- 
ger here!” Brynne exclaimed. “Not 
in the heart of New York.” 

“Here more than anjrwhere 
else,” said Janna. “For crowds 
are cloak and mask to the assas- 
sin.” 

“I shall not live long in any 
event,” the old man said with 
serene unconcern. “I must remain 
here and complete my work. It is 
so written. But I wish my daugh- 
ter to return safely to her home.” 
“I won’t go without you!” Janna 
cried. 

130 



“You will do as you are told!” 
the old man said. 

J ANNA looked meekly away 
from his steely black eyes. 
The old man turned to Brynne. 

“Sir, this afternoon a ship sails 
for India. My daughter needs a 
man, a strong, true man, to guide 
and protect her, to bring her 
home. My fortune must go to the 
man who performs this sacred 
duty for me.” 

“I can hardly believe this,” said 
Brynne, suddenly struck with 
doubt. “Are you sure — ” 

As if in answer, the old man 
pulled a small chamois bag from 
his pocket and spilled its contents 
on the tablecloth. Brynne was not 
an expert in gems, though he had 
had some dealings with them as a 
religious-instruction officer in the 
Second World Jehad. Still, he was 
sure he recognized the true fire 
of ruby, sapphire, diamond and 
emerald. 

“They are yours,” said the old 
man. “Take them to a jewelry 
store. When their authenticity is 
verified, perhaps you will believe 
the rest of my story. Or if these 
are not sufficient proof — ” 

From another pocket, he pulled 
a thick billfold and handed it to 
Brynne. Opening it, Brynne saw 
that it was stuffed with high-de- 
nomination bills. 

“Any bank will verify their au- 
thenticity,” said the old man. “No, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



please, I insist. Keep it all. Be- 
lieve me, it is only a portion of 
what I would like to bestow upon 
you for rendering me this sacred 
trust.” 

It was overwhelming. Brynne 
tried to remind himself that the 
gems could conceivably be clever 
fakes and the bills could be su- 
perb forgeries. But he knew they 
were not. They were real. And if 
this wealth, so casually given, was 
real, then didn’t the rest of the 
story have to be true? 

It would not be the first time 
a miraculous fairy-tale adventure 
happened in real life. Wasn’t the 
Book of Golden Replies filled 
with similar incidents? 

He looked at the beautiful, sor- 
rowful, golden-featured woman. A 
great desire came over him to 
bring joy to those exquisite fea- 
tures, to make that tragic mouth 
smile. And in the way she looked 
at him, Brynne perceived more 
than simply the interest one gives 
to a protector. 

“Sir!” cried the old man. “Is it 
possible that you might — that 
you might consider—” 

“I’ll do it!” said Brynne. 

'I^HE old man clasped Brynne’s 
hand. Janna simply looked at 
him, but he had the sensation of 
being enfolded into a warm em- 
brace. 

“You must leave at once,” the 
old man said briskly. “Come, 



there’s no time to lose. Even now, 
the enemy lurks in the shadows.” 
“But my clothes — ” 
“Unimportant. I will provide 
you with a wardrobe.” 

“— and friends, business ap- 
pointments. Wait! Hold on a min- 
ute!” 

Brynne took a deep breath. 
Haroun - al - Rashid adventures 
were all very well, but they had 
to be undertaken in a reasonable 
fashion. 

“I have a business appointment 
this afternoon,” Brynne said. “I 
must keep it. After that. I’m com- 
pletely at your service.” 

“The danger to Janna is too 
great!” cried the old man. 

“You’ll both be perfectly safe, 
I assure you. You can even ac- 
company me there. Or better yet, 
I’ve got a cousin on the police 
force. I’m sure I can arrange for 
a bodyguard — ” 

Janna turned her beautiful sad 
face away from him. The old man 
said, “Sir, the ship sails at one 
P.M.— at one precisely.” 

“Those ships leave every day 
or so,” Brynne pointed out. “Let’s 
catch the next one. This appoint- 
ment is very important. Crucial, 
you might say. I’ve worked for 
years to arrange it. And it’s not 
just me. I have a business, em- 
ployees, associates. For their sake, 
I have to keep that appointment.” 
“Business before life,” the old 
man said bitterly. 



THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



131 



“You’ll be all righV’ Brynne 
assured him. “It is written, you 
know, that the beast of the jungle 
shies from the tread — ” 

“I know what is written. The 
word of death is painted large 
upon my forehead, and upon my 
daughter’s, unless you aid us now. 
She will be on the Theseus in 
stateroom 2 A. The next state- 
room, 3A, will be yours. The ship 
sails at one this afternoon. If you 
value her life, sir, you will be 
there.” 

The old man and his daughter 
stood up, paid and left, ignoring 
Brynne’s pleas for reason. As she 
went out the door, Janna turned 
for a moment and gazed at him. 

“Your dried fish, sir,” said the 
waiter. He had been hovering 
near, waiting for a chance to serve 
it. 

“To hell with it!” Brynne 
shouted. “Oh, sorry, sorry,” he said 
in dismay to the shocked waiter. 
“No fault of yours.” 

He paid, leaving a sizable tip 
for the waiter, and hurried out. 
He had a lot of thinking to do. 

LL the energy expended on 
that one scene,” Lan II 
complained, “has probably cost 
me ten years of my life.” 

“You loved every minute of it,” 
said Janna Chandragore. 

“True, true,” Lan II admitted, 
nodding vigorously. He sipped a 
glass of wine that a steward had 

132 



brought to the stateroom. “The 
question now is — will he give up 
his appointment with Baxter and 
come?” 

“He does seem to like me,” 
Janna said. 

“Which shows his excellent 
taste.” 

She inclined her head mock- 
ingly. “But really, that story! Was 
it necessary to make it so — so 
outrageous?” 

“Absolutely necessary. Brynne 
is a strong and dedicated man, 
but he has his romantic streak. 
Nothing less than a fairy tale to 
match his gaudiest dream could 
pull him from duty’s path.” 

“Perhaps even a fairy tale 
won’t,” Janna said thoughtfully. 

‘We’ll see,” said Lan II. “Per- 
sonally, I believe he will come.” 

“I don’t.” 

“You imderestimate your at- 
tractiveness and acting ability, 
my dear. Wait and see.” 

“I have no choice,” said Janna, 
settling back in an arm chair. 

The desk clock read 12:42. 

* * * 

Brynne decided to take a stroll 
along the waterfront to quiet his 
nerves. The sight of the great 
ships lying calm and steadfast in 
their berths never failed to soothe 
him. He walked steadily along, 
trying to reason out what had 
happened to him. 

That magnificent sorrowful 
girl .

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



But what about his duty, the 
labor of faithful employees, to be 
culminated and completed this 
afternoon at the desk of Ben Bax- 
ter? 

He stopped and looked at the 
bow of a great ship. The Theseus. 

He thought of India, its blue 
skies, brilliant sunshine, wine, re- 
laxation. Those things would 
never be his. Work, frantic effort, 
that was the life he had set for 
himself. Even if it meant losing 
the most beautiful woman in the 
world, he would continue to labor 
under the iron-gray skies of New 
York. 

But why, he asked himself, 
touching the chamois bag in his 
pocket. He was moderately well 
off. His business could take care 
of itself. What was to stop him 
from boarding that ship, dropping 
everything, spending a year in the 
sun? 

Excitement stirred in him as he 
realized that nothing was stop- 
ping him. He was his own man, a 
strong, determined man. If he had 
the faith and will to succeed in 
business, he also had the faith and 
will to leave it, drop everything, 
and fallow his heart. 

“To hell with Baxter!” he said 
to himself. The girl’s safety was 
more important than anything. 
He would board that ship, and 
right now, wire his associates from 
sea, tell them — 

The decision was made. He 

134 



whirled and marched to the gang- 
plank and resolutely climbed it. 

An officer on the deck smiled 
and said, “Name, sir?” 

“Ned Brynne.” 

“Brynne, Brynne.” The officer 
checked his list. “I don’t seem 
to — Oh, yes, right here. Yes, Mr. 
Brynne. You’re on A deck, cabin 
3. Let me wish you a most pleas- 
ant trip.” 

“Thank you,” Brynne said, 
glancing at his watch. It read a 
quarter to one. 

“By the way,” he said to the 
officer, “what time does the ship 
sail?”. 

“At four-thirty sharp, sir.” 

“Four-thirty? Are you sure?” 

“Quite sure, Mr. Brynne.” 

“But I was told you sailed at 
one o’clock.” 

“That was the original time, sir. 
But sailing time is often advanced 
a few hours. We’ll easily make it 
up at sea.” 

Four-thirty! Yes, he had enough 
time! He could go back, see Ben 
Baxter and still return in time to 
catch the ship! Both problems 
were solved! 

Murmuring a blessing to a mys- 
terious but benevolent fate, 
Brynne turned and sprinted down 
the gangplank. He was fortunate 
enough to catch a taxi at once. 

B en BAXTER was short, solid, 
bull-chested. He was totally 
bald and his eyes, behind gold 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pince-nez, were expressionless. His 
business suit was severe and af- 
fixed to the lapel was the small 
ruby-and-pearls emblem of the 
Humble Servitors of Wall Street. 

For half an hour, Brynne had 
talked, mentioned trends, pre- 
dicted movements. He was per- 
spiring anxiously now, waiting for 
a word out of' Baxter. 

“Hmm,” said Ben Baxter. 
Brynne waited. His pulse was 
pounding heavily and his empty 
stomach was beginning to churn. 
Half his mind was on the Theseus, 
sailing soon. He wanted to end 
this meeting and get aboard. 

“The merger terms you re- 
quest,” said Baxter, “are quite sat- 
isfactory.” 

“Sir?” breathed Brynne. 
“Satisfactory, I said. Haven’t 
got trouble with your hearing, 
have you, Brother Brynne?” 

“Not for news like that,” said 
Brynne, grinning. 

“Our affiliation,” Baxter said, 
smiling, “promises a great future 
for us both. I’m a direct man, 
Brynne, and I want to tell you 
this directly: I like the way 
you’ve handled the surveys and 
data and I like the way you’ve 
handled this meeting. Moreover, I 
like you personally. I am most 
happy about this and believe our 
association will prosper.” 

“I sincerely believe so, sir.” 
They shook hands and both 
men stood up. 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



“My lawyers will draw up the 
papers,” Baxter said, “in accord- 
ance with this discussion. You 
should have them by the end of 
the week.” 

“Excellent.” Brynne hesitated, 
wondering if he should tell Bax- 
ter he was going to India. He de- 
cided not to. It would be simple 
to arrange for receipt of the pa- 
pers on the Theseus and he could 
carry out the final details by long- 
distance telephone. He wouldn’t 
be gone too long, anyhow — just 
long enough to see the girl safely 
home; then he would fly back. 

They exchanged a few more 
pleasantries, shook hands again 
and Brynne turned to leave. 

“That’s a fine-looking prayer 
stick,” Baxter said. 

“Eh? Oh, yes,” said Brynne. “I 
got it from Sinkiang just this 
week. They make the finest pray- 
er sticks there, in my unworthy 
opinion.” 

“I know. May I look at it?” 

“Of course. Please be careful, 
though. It opens rather fast.” 
Baxter took the intricately 
carved prayer stick and pressed 
the handle. A blade shot out of 
the other end, narrowly grazing 
his leg. 

“It is fast!” Baxter said. “Fast- 
est I’ve seen.” 

“Did you cut yourself?” 

“A mere scratch. Beautiful 
damascene work on that blade.” 
They talked for a few minutes 

135 



about the threefold significance of 
the knife blade in Western Bud- 
dhism and of recent develop- 
ments in the Western Buddhist 
spiritual center in Sinkiang. Then 
Baxter carefully closed the prayer 
stick and returned it to Brynne. 

“A truly beautiful thing. Good 
day again, Dear Brother Brynne, 
and — ” 

Baxter halted in mid-sentence. 
His mouth was open and he 
seemed to be staring at a point 
just in back of Brynne’s head. 

Brynne turned, but nothing was 
there except the wall. When he 
turned back, Baxter’s features 
were congested and a light froth 
had gathered at the corners of his 
mouth. 

“Sir!” cried Brynne. 

Baxter tried to speak, but 
couldn’t. He took two tottering 
steps forward and collapsed to 
the floor. 

Brynne rushed to the reception- 
ist’s office. “Call a doctor! Quick! 
Quick!” he shouted to the fright- 
ened girl. Then he rushed back to 
Baxter. 

He was looking at the first 
American case of the mutated dis- 
ease that was to be called the 
S'nkiang Plague. Transmitted on 
a hundred contaminated prayer 
sticks, it would go through New 
York like a flash fire, leaving a 
million dead in its wake. Within 
the week, the symptoms of Sin- 
kiang Plague would be better 

136 



known than those of measles. 

But Brynne was looking at the 
first casualty. 

With horror, he stared at the 
hard, brilliant apple-green shine 
of Baxter’s hands and face. 

Ill 

THE morning of April 12, 
1959, Ned Brynne awakened 
and washed and dressed. At 1:30 
that afternoon, he had an appoint- 
ment with Ben Baxter, the presi- 
dent of Baxter Industries. 
Brynne’s entire future hinged 
upon the outcome of that meet- 
ing. If he could get the backing of 
the gigantic Baxter enterprises 
and do so on favorable terms . 

Brynne was a tall, darkly hand- 
some man of thirty-six. There was 
a hint of thoughtfulness in his 
carefully bland eyes, a look of 
reason and willingness to compro- 
mise in his relaxed mouth. His 
movements had the careless surety 
of a man who knows his place in 
the world. 

He was almost ready to leave. 
He tucked an umbrella under his 
arm and slipped a paperbound 
copy of Murder on the Metro into 
his pocket. He was never without 
a good mystery of some sort. 

Finally he fixed to his laoal the 
small onyx pin of a Commodore 
the Ocean Cruising Club. Some 
people thought him too young for 
such an honor. But they had to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



agree that Brynne carried the pre- 
rogatives and requirements of his 
office with a dignity quite beyond 
his years. 

He locked his apartment and 
walked to the elevator. There was 
a small crowd waiting, mostly 
shopkeepers, but two business- 
men as well. 

“Pleasant day, Mr. Brynne,” the 
operator said as the car started 
down. 

“Hope so,” Brynne said, deep 
in thought about Ben Baxter. At 
the corner of his eye, he noticed 
one of the occupants of the car, a 
great blond Viking of a man, talk- 
ing to a tiny, half-bald fellow. 
Brynne wondered what they were 
doing in his apartment building. 
He knew most of the tenants by 
sight, though he hadn’t lived in 
the building long enough to get 
acquainted with them. 

The elevator reached the lobby 
and Brynne forgot about the Vi- 
king. He had a lot on his mind to- 
day. There were some problems 
connected with Ben Baxter, prob- 
lems he hoped to resolve before 
the meeting. He stepped outside, 
into a dismal gray April morning, 
and decided to go to Childs’ for 
breakfast. 

It was 10:25 A.M. 

46 HAT do you think?” asked 
” Dr. Sveg. 

“He looks ordinary enough,” 
said Edwin James. “He even looks 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



reasonable. We’ll find out.” 

They were following half a 
block behind Brynne. There was 
no losing Brynne’s tall, erect fig- 
ure, even in New York’s morning 
rush. 

“I am certainly not one to ad- 
vocate violence,” said Dr. Sveg. 
“But this time — why don’t we 
knock him over the head and be 
done with it?” 

“That method was selected by 
Aaui and Beatty. Miss Chandra- 
gore and Lan II decided to try 
bribery. We are committed to a 
course of reason.” 

“But suppose he can’t be rea- 
soned with, what then?” 

James shrugged his shoulders. 

“I don’t like it,” Dr. Sveg said. 

Following half a block behind, 
they saw Brynne collide with a 
portly, florid-faced businessman. 

“Sorry,” said Brynne. 

“Sorry,” said the portly busi- 
nessman. 

They exchanged perfunctory 
nods and went on. 

Brynne went into Childs’ and 
sat down at an empty table in the 
rear. Now was the time to think 
of Ben Baxter and of what the 
best approach would be — 

“Your order, sir?” a waiter 
asked him.' 

“Scrambled eggs, toast, coffee,” 
Brynne said. 

“French fries?” 

“No, thanks.” 

The waiter hurried off. Brynne 

137 



concentrated on Ben Baxter. With 
Baxter’s financial and political 
backing of the forest deal, there 
was no telling — 

“Excuse me, sir,” a voice said. 
“May we talk to you?” 

Brynne looked up and saw the 
blond man and his small friend 
whom he had seen in the elevator. 
“What about?” 

“A matter of the utmost ur- 
gency, sir,” said the small man. 

Brynne glanced at his watch. 
It was almost 11:00. He had two 
and a half hours before his meet- 
ing with Baxter. 

“Sure, sit down,” he invited. 
“What’s on your mind?” 

The men looked at each other 
and exchanged embarrassed 
smiles. Finally the small man 
cleared his throat. 

“Mr. Brynne,” he said, “I am 
Edwin Jarnes. This is my associ- 
ate, Dr. Sveg. We have a prepos- 
terous - sounding story to tell, 
which I hope you will hear to 
the end without interruptions. 
After that, we have certain proofs 
that may or may not convince 
you of the story’s authenticity.” 
Brynne frowned, wondering 
what kind of crackpots he had 
met. But both men were well 
dressed, quietly spoken. 

“Sure, go ahead,” Brynne said. 

A N HOUR and twenty minutes 
later, Brynne was saying, 
“Wow! That’s quite a little yarn!” 

138 



“I know,” Dr. Sveg said apolo- 
getically. “Our proofs—” 

“— are impressive. Let me see 
that first gadget again.” 

Sveg handed it to him. Brynne 
stared reverently at the small, 
shining object. 

“Boys, if a thing that size can 
really turn out heat or cold in 
those quantities — the electrical 
corporations would give a couple 
of billion to get it!” 

“It is a product of our tech- 
nology,” said Chief Programmer 
James, “as are the other gadgets. 
With the exception of the motri- 
fier, they are all straight-line de- 
velopments, refinements of pres- 
ent trends.” 

“And that thallasator. Nice, 
simple, inexpensive way of ex- 
tracting fresh water from salt.” He 
looked at the two men. “It is pos- 
sible, of course, that these items 
are a hoax.” 

Dr. Sveg raised both eyebrows. 

“But I’m not exactly untrained 
in science. Even if they’re a hoax, 
they’d have to be every bit as ad- 
vanced as the real thing. I guess 
you’ve sold me. Men from the fu- 
ture! Well, well!” 

“Then you accept what we say 
about you?” James asked. “And 
about Ben Baxter and time-line 
selection?” 

“Well . .” Brynne thought hard. 
“Tentatively.” 

“Will you cancel your appoint- 
ment with Baxter?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I don’t know.” 

“Sir?” 

“I said I don’t know. You’ve got 
a lot of nerve,” Brynne said an- 
grily. “I’ve worked like a galley 
slave, driving toward this goal. 
This meeting is the biggest chance 
I’ve ever had or ever will have. 
And you ask me to give up all 
that because of some nebulous 
prediction — ” 

“The prediction isn’t nebulous,” 
James said. “It is very explicit 
and most precise.” 

“Look, there’s more involved 
than just me. I have a business, 
employees, associates, stockhold- 
ers. I have to keep this meeting 
for their sake, too.” 

“Mr. Brynne,” said Sveg, “con- 
sider the larger issues at stake!” 
“Yeah, sure,” Brynne said sour- 
ly. “How about those other teams 
you talked about? Maybe I’ve 
been stopped in some other prob- 
ability world.” 

“You haven’t.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I couldn’t say so to the teams,” 
Chief Programmer James said, 
“but the probability of their suc- 
cess was vanishingly small — just 
as the probability of my success 
with you is small, statistically.” 
“Hell,” said Brynne, “you guys 
come dropping out of the future 
and casually ask a man to change 
his entire life. You haven’t got 
the right!” 

“If you could postpone the ap- 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



pointment for a single day,” Dr. 
Sveg suggested, “that might — ” 
“You don’t postpone appoint- 
ments with Ben Baxter. Either 
you keep the one he’s given you 
or you wait — maybe forever — 
until he gives you another.” 
Brynne stood up. “Look, I don’t 
know what I’m going to do. I’ve 
heard you, I more or less believe 
you, but I just don’t know. I’ll 
have to make up my own mind.” 
Dr. Sveg and James also stood 
up. 

“That is your privilege,” said 
Chief Programmer James. “Good- 
by. I hope you make the right 
decision, Mr. Brynne.” 

They shook hands. Brynne hur- 
ried out. 

Dr. Sveg and James watched 
him go. Sveg said, “What do you 
think? It looks favorable, doesn’t 
it? Don’t you think so?” 

“I can’t guess,” James said. 
“The possibility of altering events 
within a time-line is never favor- 
able. I honestly have no idea of 
what he’s going to do.” 

Dr. Sveg shook his head, then 
sniffed. “Some air, eh?” 

“Quite,” said Chief Programmer 
James. 

"ORYNNE decided to take a 
stroll along the waterfront to 
quiet his nerves. The sight of the 
great ships lying calm and stead- 
fast in their berths never failed to 
soothe him. He walked steadily

along, trying to reason out what 
had happened to him. 

That ridiculous story . 

In which he believed. 

But what about his duty, the 
years spent working his way up 
to optioning that huge forest tract, 
its tremendbus possibilities to be 
culminated and completed this 
afternoon at the desk of Ben 
Baxter? 

He stopped and looked at the 
bow of a great ship. The The- 
seus . 

He thought of the Caribbean, 
its blue skies, brilliant sunshine, 
wine, relaxation. Those things 
would never be his. Work, frantic 
effort, that was the life he had set 
for himself. No matter what the 
loss, he would continue to work 
under the iron-gray skies of New 
York. 

But why, he asked himself. He 
was moderately well off. His busi- 
ness could take care of itself. 
What was to stop him from board- 
ing that ship, dropping every- 
thing, spending a year in the svm? 

Excitement stirred in him as 
he realized that nothing was stop- 
ping him. He was his own man, a 
strong, determined man. If he had 
the guts to succeed in business, he 
also had the guts to leave it, drop 
everything, and follow his heart. 

And in that way, the ridiculous 
damned future would be safe. 

“To hell with Ben Baxter!” he 
said to himself. 



But he didn’t mean it. 

The future was just too uncer- 
tain, too far away. This whole 
thing might well be an elaborate 
hoax, arranged by a business com- 
petitor. 

Let the future take care of it- 
self! 

Ned Brynne turned abruptly 
away from the Theseus. He had 
to hurry to make his appointment 
with Baxter on time. 

In Baxter’s building, riding up 
in the elevator, Brynne tried not 
to think. It was enough simply to 
act. He got off at the 16th floor 
and walked up to the receptionist. 

“My name is Brynne. I have an 
appointment with Mr. Baxter.” 

“Yes, Mr. Brynne. Mr. Baxter 
is expecting you. You can go right 
in.” 

Brynne didn’t move. A wave of 
doubt flooded his mind and he 
thought of the future generations, 
whose chances he was damaging 
by his act. He thought of Dr. Sveg 
and Chief Programmer Edwin 
James, earnest, well-meaning men. 
They wouldn’t ask him to make 
such a sacrifice unless it was ab- 
solutely essential. 

And he considered one thing 
more — 

Among those future generations 
would be descendants of his own. 

“You may go in, sir,” the girl 
said. 

Abruptly, something snapped in 
Brynne’s mind. 



THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



141 



“I’ve changed my mind,” he 
said, in a voice he hardly recog- 
nized. “I’m canceling the appoint- 
ment. Tell Baxter I’m sorry — 
about everything.” 

He turned, before he could 
change his mind, and ran down 
sixteen flights of stairs. 

TN THE meeting room of the 
World Planning Council, the 
five representatives of the Feder- 
ated Districts of Earth were seat- 
ed around a long table, waiting 
for Edwin James. He entered, a 
small man, impressively ugly. 

“Reports,” he said. 

Aaui, looking somewhat the 
worse for wear, told about their 
attempt at violence and its result. 
“Perhaps,” he concluded, “if we 
had been conditioned to use more 
violence — faster — we could have 
stopped him.” 

“And perhaps not,” said Beatty, 
who looked considerably worse 
than Aaui. 

Lan II reported the partial suc- 
cess and total failure of his mis- 
sion with Miss Chandragore. 
Brynne had agreed to accompany 
them to India, even if it meant 
giving up the meeting with Bax- 
ter. Unfortunately, Brynne had 
found himself able to do both 
things. 

Lan II ended with several philo- 
sophical comments about the 
shockingly flexible schedules of 
steamship companies.

Chief Programmer James stood 
up. “The future we were selecting 
for was one in whose past Ben 
Baxter lived to complete his work 
of buying forests. That, unfortu- 
nately, is not to be. Our best line, 
under the circumstances, is the 
Main Historic Line, in which Dr. 
Sveg and I bent our efforts.” 
“You haven’t reported yet,” 
Miss Chandragore said. “What 
happened?” 

“Reason,” said Edwin James, 
“and an appeal to the intelligence 
seem to be the best operating pro- 
cedures. After due thought, 
Brynne decided not to keep his 
appointment with Ben Baxter. 
But 

"OEN BAXTER was short, solid, 
bull-chested. He was totally 
bald and his eyes, behind gold 
pince-nez, were expressionless. His 
business suit was severe and af- 
fixed to the lapel was the small 
ruby-andrpearls emblem of the 
Wall Street Club. 

He had been sitting motionless 
for half an hour now, thinking 
about figures, trends, movements. 
His buzzer sounded. 

“Yes, Miss Cassidy?” 

“Mr. Brynne was here. He just 
left.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I really don’t understand it,. 
Mr. Baxter. He came up and said 
he wanted to cancel his appoint- 
ment.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“What did he say? Repeat it 
exactly, Miss Cassidy.” 

“He said he had an appoint- 
ment with you and I said he could 
go right in. And he stood there 
looking at me very strangely, 
frowning. He seemed angry and 
upset. I told him again he could 
go in. Then he said — ” 

“Word for word now. Miss Cas- 
sidy.” 

“Yes, sir. He said, ‘I’ve changed 
my mind. I’m canceling the ap- 
pointment. Tell Baxter I’m sorry 
— for everything.’ ” 

“That’s all he said?” 

“Every last word, Mr. Baxter.” 
“And then?” 

“He turned and hurried down- 
stairs.” 

“Stairs?” 

“Yes, Mr. Baxter. He didn’t 
wait for the elevator.” 

“I see.” 

“Is there anything else, Mr. 
Baxter?” 

“No, nothing else, Miss Cas- 
sidy. Thank you.” 

n<-ii Baxter turned off the inter- 
com and slumped wearily behind 
his desk. 

So Hrynne knew! 

1 1 was the only possible expla- 
nalion. Word must have gotten 
out somehow, somewhere. He had 
tlioiiKhl it was safely hidden for 
allot lici day, at least. But there 
must liave been a leak. 

Maxlcr smiled grimly to him- 
self. Hi‘ couldn’t blame Brynne, 

THE DEATHS OF BEN BAXTER 



though the man should at least 
have talked to him. But perhaps 
not. Maybe it was best this way. 

But how had he found out? 
Who had broken the news to him 
that the Baxter industrial empire 
was hollow, decaying, crumbling 
at the foundations? 

If only the news could have 
been concealed for another day, 
another few hours! He would have 
signed with Brynne. A fresh ven- 
ture would have pumpied new 
blood into the Baxter holdings. 
By the time people found out, he 
would once again have had a solid 
base from which to operate. 

Bryrme knew and had been 
scared off. That meant everyone 
knew. 

There was no holding things to- 
gether now. The wolves would be 
at him. His friends, his wife, his 
partners and all the little people 
who had depended upon him . 

Well, he had decided years ago 
what to do in this eventuality. 

Without hesitation, Baxter 
opened his desk drawer and took 
out a small bottle. He extracted 
two white tablets. 

He had always lived by his own 
rules. Now was the time to die by 
them. 

Ben Baxter popped the pills 
into his mouth. In two minutes, he 
slumped forward on the desk. 

His death precipitated the great 
stock market crash of ’59.
