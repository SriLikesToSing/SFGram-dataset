THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid^ 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA 



T hat looks very like a 
Fred Pohl story title, 
doesn’t it? It happens not to 
be, however, but instead the 
name of an extra-ordinary 
book by Willard Bascom, 
published by Doubleday at 
$4.95. 

Bascom is the head of the 
Mohole Project, which in- 
tends to drill a hole right 
through the earth’s crust into 
the mantle to see if they can’t 
bring up a core. They’ll drill 
where the crust is thinnest, 
and that happens to be under 
some miles of sea-water. You 
have to be crazy in some very 
special way even to think of 
such a thing, and that’s Bas- 
com. 

The book includes an ac- 
count of the organization 
from which this heady idea 
sprang: AMSOC. AMSOC 
had its beginnings somewhere 
in the inner circle of the Of- 
fice of Naval Research, which 
guides the Navy’s basic re- 
search program and keeps up 
contacts with universities and 
private laboratories. One hot 
summer day in ’52, two of 
these broad-spectrum geniuses 
tried to organize a huge pile 
of incoming proposals and 
suggestions for research, by 
putting them in a few neat 
piles. When they were fin- 
ished, desks, tables, chairs and 
floor were covered with neat 
piles — each one paper deep. 
They then gathered them to- 
gether into one pile and 
6 



sweatily looked at each other, 
and at that moment the or- 
ganization got its name : the 
American Miscellaneous Soci- 
ety. 

To this day the now re- 
spectable deep-drilling pro- 
ject has the cable address 
AMSOC, Washington, D.C., 
and its letterhead bears the 
figure of a geophysicist ram- 
pa : on his fields of action- 
earth, air, fire and water. 

Right at the start the organ- 
ization (which has no mem- 
bership rolls, dues, officers, 
bylaws or meetings) v^as effi- 
cently organized into five di- 
visions: Etceterology, Phe- 

nomenology, Calamitology, 
Generalogy and Triviology. 
These men got together at 
brainstorming sessions which 
would take the breath away 
from E. E. Smith. Once, just 
for kicks, they conceived a 
plan to bring water to Cali- 
fornia by hauling, with tug- 
boats, an Antarctic iceberg 
(the Arctic ones are salty) 
600 feet thick and 10 miles 
long from Little America and 
(because of prevailing cur- 
rents) around Hawaii so that 
it could be moored in the 
Channel Islands near Los 
Angeles. They worked the 
project out in such detail that 
it looked not only feasible but 
perhaps too efficient: it 
might well change the climate 
too much. 

Yet project Mohole is now a 
serious, practical endeavor. 




for all its wild letterhead ; and 
in telling about it, Bascom 
briefs you in everything con^ 
nected with it — the creation 
of the earth, the origins of 
life, the structure of stars, the 
natural history of the ocean 
and the land and the atmos- 
phere. There’s drilling, as it 
is, and as it’s going to have to 
be before they’re through; 
ships, navigation, explosives, 
buoys and anchors — ^why, the 
man’s a whole corps of speci- 
alists all by himself. 

T HERE’S one sharp and 
timely point connected 
with this whole astonishing 
effort. Last September a let- 
ter appeared in a New York 
paper, pouncing on an article 
a few days before headed SO- 
VIET CONSIDERS FIVE 
EARTH PROBES. The let- 
ter was written by this same 
Bascom, and, even admitting 
that it’s his own pony he’s 
riding, I think you’ll agree he 
has something to say. 

On August 24, he reports, 
he was invited to show pic- 
tures and to lecture on Pro- 
ject Mohole before the scien- 
tists of the Soviet research 
ship Vityaz, He did so. He 
says they were warmly con- 
gratulatory and seemed sur- 
prised by the scale of the U.S. 
deep sea operations. He says 
they spoke vaguely about a 
Russian effort on land in the 
near future. 

So along comes this Sept. 10 
release from Moscow describ- 



ing a monster five-pronged 
Soviet m a n 1 1 e-drilling pro- 
ject: one in the Caspian, four 
on land: In Karelia, the Ural 
Mountains, the Caucasus and 
the Kuriles. 

Bascom goes on to say that 
though scientists all over wel- 
come the competition — it 

makes more work get done — 
the fact remains that this ‘‘sci- 
entific Olympics,” as he calls 
it, isn’t altogether just a jolly 
game. Bascom, who certainly 
should know, says we have the 
initial advantage. On land we 
have drilled to 25,000 feet, the 
Soviets about 17,000. Project 
M o h o 1 e ’ s test drilling in 
water, totaling 11,700 feet, is 
nearly 100 times their rec- 
ord. “Nevertheless,” Bascom 
writes, “I am concerned that 
another hare and tortoise race 
will develop . Although they 
have a long way to go, they 
have accepted the conditions 
of the race. We must. .be 
wary that even in areas where 
they are not superior, propa- 
ganda may make them seem 
so. We must run, and win, and 
tell the world we have won.” 

This department couldn’t 
agree more ; and it seems time 
to remind the world that at 
Sputnik time, and at Russian 
H-bomb time, and even at as- 
tronaut time, sleepy people 
were stumbling about, bleat- 
ing that no one had warned 
them. 

Well, about this one Bas- 
com has issued the warning. 
Let’s see what happens. END

THE 

YILLIAN 

WAY 



I 

J AME Retief, vice-consul 
and third secretary in the 
Diplomatic Corps, followed 
the senior members of the ter- 
restrial mission across the 
tarmac and into the gloom of 
the reception building. The 
gray-skinned Yill guide who 
had met the arriving embassy 
at the foot of the ramp hur- 
ried away. The councillor, 
two first secretaries and the 
senior attaches gathered 
around the ambassador, their 
ornate uniforms bright in the 
vast dun-colored room. 

Ten minutes passed. Retief 
strolled across to the nearest 
door and looked through the 
glass panel at the room be- 
yond. Several dozen Yill 



lounged in deep couches, sip- 
ping lavender drinks from 
slender glass tubes. Black- 
tunicked servants moved 
about inconspicuously, offer- 
ing trays. A party of brightly- 
dressed Yill moved toward the 
entrance doors. One of the 
party, a tall male, made to step 
before another, who raised a 
hand languidly, fist clenched. 
The first Yill stepped back 
and placed his hands on top 
of his head. Both Yill were 
smiling and chatting as they 
passed through the doors. 

Retief turned away to re- 
join the Terrestrial delegation 
waiting beside a mound of 
crates made of rough greenish 
wood stacked on the bare con- 
crete floor. 

As Retief came up, Ambas- 



The cereirtoniGus protocol of the 
YbIIs was impressive, coioHyl 
— and. In the long run, deadly! 




sador Spradley glanced at his 
finger watch and spoke to the 
man beside him. 

“Ben, are you quite certain 
our arrival time was made 
clear?’’ 

Second Secretary Magnan 
nodded emphatically. “I 
stressed the point, Mr. Ambas- 
sador. I communicated with 
Mr. T’Cai-Cai just before the 
lighter broke orbit, and I 
specifically — ” 

“I hope you didn’t appear 
truculent, Mr. Magnan,” the 
ambassador said sharply. 

“No indeed, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor. I merely — ” 

'‘You’re sure there’s no VIP 
room here?” The ambassador 
glanced around the cavernous 
room. “Curious that not even 
chairs have been provided.” 
“If you’d care to sit on one 
of these crates — ” 

“Certainly not.” The ambas- 
sador looked at his watch 
again and cleared his throat. 

“I may as well make use of 
these fev/ moments to outline 
our approach for the more 
junior members of the staff; 
it’s vital that the entire mis- 
sion work in harmony in the 
presentation of the image. We 
Terrestrials are a kindly, 
peace-loving race.” The am- 
bassador smiled in a kindly, 
peace-loving way. 

“We seek only a reasonable 
division of spheres of influ- 
ence with the Yill.” He 
spread his hands, looking rea- 
sonable. 

“We are a people of high 
culture, ethical, sincere.” The 

THE YILLIAN WAY 



smile was replaced abruptly 
by pursed lips. 

“We’ll start by asking for 
the entire Sirenian System, 
and settle for half. We’ll es- 
tablish a foothold on all the 
choicer worlds. And, with 
shrewd handling, in a century 
we’ll be in a position to assert 
a wider claim.” 

The ambassador glanced 
around. “If there are no ques- 
tions—” 

R ETIEF stepped forward. 

“It’s my understanding, 
Mr. Ambassador, that we hold 
the prior claim to the Sirenian 
System. Did I understand 
your Excellency to say that 
we’re ready to concede half 
of it to the Yill without a 
struggle?” 

Ambassador Spradley 
looked up at Retief, blinking. 
The younger man loomed 
over him. Beside him, Mag- 
nan cleared his throat in the 
silence. 

“Vice-Consul Retief merely 
means — ” 

“I can interpret Mr. Reti- 
ef’s remark,” the ambassador 
snapped. He assumed a father- 
ly expression. 

“Young man, you’re new to 
the Service. You haven’t yet 
learned the team play, the 
give-and-take of diplomacy. I 
shall expect you to observe 
closely the work of the expe- 
rienced negotiators of the 
mission. You must learn the 
importance of subtlety.” 

“Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan 
said, “I think the reception 



9 




committee is arriving.” He 
pointed. Half a dozen tall, 
short-necked Yill were enter- 
ing through a side door. The 
leading Yill hesitated as an- 
other stepped in his path. He 
raised a fist, and the other 
moved aside, touching the top 
of his head perfunctorily with 
both hands. The group started 
across the room toward the 
Terrestrials. Relief watched 
as a slender alien came for- 
ward and spoke passable Ter- 
ran in a reedy voice. 

“I am P'Toi. Come this 
way...” He turned, and the 
group moved toward the door, 
the ambassador leading. As he 
reached for the door, the in- 
terpreter darted ahead and 
shouldered him aside. The 
other Yill stopped, waiting. 

The ambassador almost 
glared, then remembered the 
image. He smiled and beck- 
oned the Yill ahead. They 
milled uncertainly, muttering 
in the native tongue, then 
passed through the door. 

The Terran party followed. 

” — give a great deal to know 
what they're saying,” Retief 
overheard as he came up. 

“Our interpreter has forged 
to the van,” the ambassador 
said. “I can onlj^ assume he'll 
appear when needed.” 

“A pity we have to rely on 
a native interpreter,” someone 
said. 

“Had I known we’d meet 
this rather uncouth recep- 
tion,” the ambassador said 
stiffly, “I would have audited 
the language personally, of 
10 



course, during the voyage 
out.” 

“Oh, no criticism intended, 
of course, Mr. Ambassador.” 

“Heavens,” Magnan put in. 
“Who would have thought — ” 

Retief moved up behind the 
ambassador. 

“Mr. Ambassador,” he said, 

« j » 

“Later, young man,” the am- 
bassador snapped. He beck- 
oned to the first councillor, 
ails- i;he two moved off, heads 
together. 

Outside, a bluish sun 
gleamed in a dark sky. Retief 
watched his breath form a 
frosty cloud in the chill air. 
A broad doughnut-wheeled 
vehicle was drawn up to the 
platform. The Yill gestured 
the Terran party to the gap- 
ing door at the rear, then 
stood back, waiting. 

Retief looked curiously at 
the gray-painted van. The 
legend written on its side in 
alien symbols seemed to read 
'‘egg nog.” 

T he ambassador entered 
the vehicle, the other Ter- 
restrials following. It was as 
bare of seats as the Terminal 
building. What appeared to 
be a defunct electronic chassis 
lay in the center of the floor. 

Retief glanced back. The 
Yill were talking excitedly. 
None of them entered the car. 
The door was closed, and the 
Terrans braced themselves 
under the low roof as the en- 
gine started up with a whine 
of worn tubos. 

by Keith Laumer 




The van moved off. 

It was an uncomfortable 
ride. Retief put out an arm 
as the vehicle rounded a cor- 
ner, just catching 'he ambas- 
sador as he staggered, off-bal- 
ance. The ambassador glared 
at him, settled his heavy tri- 
corner hat and stood stiffly 
until the car lurched again. 

Retief stooped, attempting 
to see out through the single 
dusty windov/. They seemed 
to be in a wide street lined 
with low buildings. 

They .passed through a 
massive gate, up a ramp, and 
stopped. The door opened. 
Retief looked out at a blank 
gray facade, broken by tiny 
windows at irregular inter- 
vals. A scarlet vehicle was 
drawn up ahead, the Yill re- 
ception committee emerging 
from it. Through its wide 
windows Retief saw rich up- 
holstery and caught a glimpse 
of glasses clamped to a tiny 
bar. 

P’Toi, the Yill interpreter, 
came forward, gestured to a 
small door. Magnan opened it, 
waiting for the ambassador. 

As he stepped to it, a Yill 
thrust himself ahead and hesi- 
tated. Ambassador Spradley 
drew himself up, glaring. 
Then he twisted his mouth 
into a frozen smile and 
stepped aside. 

The Yill looked at each oth- 
er, then filed through the 
door. 

Retief was the last to en- 
ter. As he stepped inside, a 
black-clad servant slipped 

THE YILLIAN WAY 



past him, pulled the lid from 
a large box by the door and 
dropped in a paper tray 
heaped with refuse. There 
were alien sjmbols in flaking 
paint on the box. They 
seemed, Retief noticed, to 
spell “egg nog.” 

II 

T he shrill pipes and whin- 
ing reeds had been warm- 
ing up for an hour when 
Retief emerged from his cu- 
bicle and descended the stairs 
to the banquet hall. 

Standing by the op::n doors, 
he lit a slender cigar and 
watched through narrowed 
eyes as obsequious servants in 
black flitted along the low 
wide corridor, carrying laden 
trays into the broad room, ar- 
ranging settings on a great 
four-sided table forming a 
hollow square that almost 
filled the room. Rich brocades 
were spread across the center 
of the side nearest the door, 
flanked by heavily decorated 
white cloths. Beyond, plain 
white extended to the far 
side, where metal dishes were 
arranged on the bare table top. 

A richly dressed Yill ap- 
proached, stepped aside to al- 
low a servant to pass and en- 
tered the room. 

Retief turned at the sound 
of Terran voices behind him. 
The ambassador came up, 
trailed by two diplomats. He 
glanced at Retief, adjusted 
his ruff and looked into the 
banquet hall. 



11 




“Apparently we’re to be 
kept waiting again,” he mut- 
tered. “After having been in- 
formed at the outset that the 
Yill have no intention of 
yielding an inch, one almost 
wonders. 

“Mr. Ambassador,” Retief 
said. “Have you noticed — ” 

“H o w e V e r,” Ambassador 
Spradley said, eyeing Retief, 
“a seasoned diplomatist must 
take these little snubs in 
stride. In the end — Ah, there, 
Magnan.” He turned away, 
talking. 

Somewhere a gong clanged. 

In a moment, the corridor 
was filled with chattering 
Yill who moved past the 
group of Terrestrials into the 
banquet hall. P’Toi, the Yill 
interpreter, came up and 
raised a hand. 

“Waitt heere...” 

More Yill filed into the din- 
ing room to take their places. 
A pair of helmeted guards ap- 
proached, waving the Terres- 
trials back. An immense gray- 
jowled Yill waddled to the 
doors and passed through, fol- 
lowed by more guards. 

“The Chief of State,” Retief 
heard Magnan say. “The Ad- 
mirable F’Kau-Kau-Kau.” 

‘T have yet to present 
my credentials,” Ambassador 
Spradley said. “One expects 
some latitude in the ob- 
servances of protocol, but I 
confess...” He wagged his 
head. 

The Yill interpreter spoke 
up. 

“You now whill Ihie on 



yourr intesstinss, and creep 
to fesstive board there.” He 
pointed across the room. 

“Intestines?” Ambassador 
Spradley looked about wildly. 

“Mr. P’Toi means our stom- 
achs, I wouldn’t wonder,” 
Magnan said. “He just wants 
us to lie down and crawl to 
our seats, Mr. Ambassador.” 
“What the devil are you 
grinning at, you idiot?” the 
ambassador snapped. 

M AGNAN’S face fell. 

Spradley glanced down 
at the medals across his 
paunch. 

“This is... I’ve never...’' 
“Homage to godss,” the in- 
terpreter said. 

“Oh. Oh, religion,” someone 
said. 

“Well, if it’s a matter of re- 
ligious beliefs. .” The ambas- 
sador looked dubiously 
around. 

“Golly, it’s only a couple 
of hundred feet,” Magnan of- 
fered. 

Retief stepped up to P’Toi. 
“His Excellency the Terres- 
trial Ambassador will not 
crawl,” he said clearly. 

“Here, young man! I said 
nothing — ” 

“Not to crawl?” The in- 
terpreter wore an unreadable 
Yill expression. 

“It is against our religion,” 
Retief said. 

“Againsst?” 

“We are votaries of the 
Snake Goddess,” Retief said. 
“It is a sacrilege to crawl.” 
He brushed past the in- 

bt Keitli Launier

terpreter and marched toward 
the distant table. 

The others followed. 

Puffing, the ambassador 
came to Retief's side as they 
approached the dozen empty 
stools on the far side of the 
square opposite the brocaded 
position of the Admirable 
F*Kau-Kau-Kau. 

“Mr. Retief, kindly see me 
after this affair,’’ he hissed. 
“In the meantime, I hope you 
will restrain any further rash 
impulses. Let me remind you 
I am chief of mission here.” 

Magnan came up from be- 
hind. 

“Let me add my congratula- 
tions, Retief,” he said. “That 
was fast thinking — ” 

“Are you out of your mind, 
Magnan?” the ambassador 
barked. “I am extremely dis- 
pleased !” 

“Why,” Magnan stuttered, 
“I was speaking sarcastically, 
of course, Mr. Ambassador. 
Didn’t you notice the kind of 
shocked little gasp I gave 
when he did it?” 

The Terrestrials took their 
places, Retief at tlie end. The 
table before them v/as of bare 
green wood, with an array of 
shallow pewter dishes. 

Some of the Yill at the ta- 
ble were in plain gray, others 
in black. All eyed them silent- 
ly. There was a constant stir 
among them as one or another 
rose and disappeared and oth- 
ers sat down. The pipes and 
reeds were shrilling furiously, 
and the susurration of Yillian 
conversation from the other 
THE YILLIAN WAY 



tables rose ever higher in 
competition. 

A tall Yill in black was at 
the ambassador’s side now. 
The nearby Yill fell silent as 
he began ladling a whitish 
soup into the largest of the 
bowls before the Terrestrial 
envoy. The interpreter hov- 
ered, watching. 

“That’s quite enough,” Am- 
bassador Spradley said, as the 
bowl overflowed. The Yill 
servant rolled his eyes, drib- 
bled more of the soup into 
the bowl. 

“Kindly serve the other 
members of my staff,” the am- 
bassador said. The interpreter 
said something in a lov/ voice. 
The servant moved hesitantly 
to the next stool and ladled 
more soup. 

R etief watched, listening 
to the whispers around 
him. The Yill at the table 
were craning now to watch. 
The soi:p ladler was ladling 
rapidly, rolling his e} es side- 
ways. He came to Retief, 
reached out with the full ladle 
for the bowl. 

“No,” Retief said. 

The ladler hesitated. 

“None for me,” Retief said. 
The interpreter came up 
and motioned to the servant, 
who reached again, ladle 
brimming. 

“I . .. DON’T ... LIKE ... 
IT!” Retief said, his voice dis- 
tinct in the sudden hush. Tie 
stared at the interpreter, who 
stared back, then waved the 
servant av/ay. 



13 




‘‘Mr. Retief!*’ a voice 
hissed. 

Retief looked down at the 
table. The ambassador was 
leaning forward, glaring at 
him, his face a mottled crim- 
son. 

“I'm warning you, Mr. 
Retief," he said hoarsely. “I've 
eaten sheep's eyes in the Su- 
dan, ka swe in Burma, hun- 
dred-year cug on Mars and 
everything else that has been 
placed before me in the course 
of my diplomatic career. And, 
by the holy relics of Saint 
Ignatz, you'll do the same!" 
He snatched up a spoon-like 
utensil and dipped it into his 
bowl. 

“Don’t eat that, Mr. Ambas- 
sador," Retief said. 

The ambassador stared, eyes 
wide. He opened his mouth, 
guided the spoon toward it — 

Retief stood, gripped the 
table under its edge and 
heaved. The immense wooden 
slab rose and tilted, dishes 
sliding. It crashed to the floor 
with a ponderous slam. 

Whitish soup splattered 
across the terrazzo. A couple 
of odd bowls rolled across the 
room. Cries rang out from the 
Yill, mingling with a stran- 
gled yell from Ambassador 
Spradley. 

Retier walked past the wild- 
eyed members of the mission 
to the sputtering chief. “Mr. 
Ambassador," he said. “I'd 
like — " 

“You'd like! I'll break you, 
you young hoodlum! Do you 
realize — "

“Pleass..." The interpreter 
stood at Retief's side. 

“My apologies,” Ambassador 
Spradley said, mopping his 
forehead. “My profound apol- 
ogies." 

“Be quiet," Retief said. 

'^Wha— what?" 

“Don't apologize," Retief 
said. P'Toi was beckoning. 

“Pleasse, aril come." 

Retief turned and followed 
him. 

The portion of the table 
they were ushered to was cov- 
ered with an embroidered 
white cloth, set with thin por- 
celain dishes. The Yill already 
seated there rose, amid bab- 
bling, and moved down the ta- 
ble. The black-clad Yill at the 
end table closed ranks to fill 
the vacant seats. Retief sat 
down and found Magnan at 
his side. 

“What’s going on here?" 
the second secretary said an- 
grily. 

“They were giving us dog 
food," Retief said. “I over- 
heard a Yill. They seated us 
at the bottotn of the servants' 
table — " 

“You mean you know their 
language?" 

“I learned it on the way 
out. Enough, at least." 

The music burst out with a 
clangorous fanfare, and a 
throng of jugglers, dancers 
and acrobats poured into the 
center of the hollow square, 
frantically juggling, dancing 
and back-flipping. Black-clad 
servants swarmed suddenly, 
heaping mounds of fragrant 

by Keith Laumer 




food on the plates of Yill and 
Terrestrials alike, pouring a 
pale purple liquor into slen- 
der glasses. Retief sampled 
the Yill food. It was deli- 
cious. 

Conversation was impossi- 
ble in the din. He watched 
the gaudy display and ate 
heartily. 

Ill 

R etief leaned back, grate- 
ful for the lull in the mu- 
sic. The last of the dishes 
were whisked away, and more 
glasses filled. The exhausted 
entertainers stepped to pick 
up the thick square coins the 
diners threw. 

Retief sighed. It had been 
a rare feast. 

“Retief,'' Magnan said in 
the comparative quiet, “what 
were you saying about dog 
food as the music came up?" 

Retief looked at him. 
“Haven’t you noticed the pat- 
tern, Mr. Magnan? The series 
of deliberate affronts?" 

“Deliberate affronts! Just a 
minute, Retief. They’re un- 
couth, yes, crowding into 
doorways and that sort of 
thing. ." He looked at Retief 
uncertainly. 

“They herded us into a bag- 
gage warehouse at the ter- 
minal. Then they hauled us 
here in a garbage truck — ” 
“Garbage truck!” 

“Only symbolic, of course. 
They ushered us in the trades- 
man's entrance, and assigned 
us cubicles in the servants' 

THE YILLIAN WAY 



wing. Then we were seated 
with the coolie class sweepers 
at the bottom of the table." 

“You must be... I mean, 
we're the Terrestrial delega- 
tion! Surely these Yill must 
realize our power." 

“Precisely, Mr. Magnan. 
But—" 

With a clang of cymbals 
the musicians launched a re- 
newed assault. Six tall, hel- 
meted Yill sprang into the 
center of the floor and paired 
off in a wild performance, half 
dance, half combat. Magnan 
pulled at Retief’s arm, his 
mouth moving. 

Retief shook his head. No 
one could talk against a Yill 
orchestra in full cry. Fle sam- 
pled a bright red wine and 
watched the show. 

There was a flurry of ac- 
tion, and two of the dancers 
stumbled and collapsed, their 
partner-opponents whirling 
away to pair off again, de- 
scribe the elaborate pre-com- 
bat ritual, and abruptly set to, 
dulled sabres clashing — and 
two more Yill were down, 
stunned. It was a violent 
dance. 

Retief watched, the drink 
forgotten. 

The last two Yill ap- 
proached and retreated, 
whirled, bobbed and spun, 
feinted and postured — and on 
the instant, clashed, straining 
chest-to-chest — then broke 
apart, heavy weapons chop- 
ping, parrying, as the music 
mounted to a frenzy. 

Evenly matched, the two 



15 




hacked, thrust, blow for blow, 
across the floor, then back, 
defense forgotten, slugging it 
out. 

And then one was slipping, 
going down, helmet awry. The 
other, a giant, muscular Yill, 
spun away, whirled in a mad 
skirl of pipes as coins show- 
ered — then froze before a 
gaudy table, raised the sabre 
and slammed it dovm in a re- 
sounding blow across the gay 
cloth before a lace and bow- 
bedecked Yill in the same in- 
stant that the music stopped. 

In utter silence the dancer- 
fighter stared across the table 
at the seated Yill. 

With a shout, the Yill 
leaped up, raised a clenched 
fist. The dancer bowed his 
head, spread his hands on his 
helmet. 

Retief took a deep gulp of 
a pale yellow liqueur and 
leaned forward to watch. The 
beribboned Yill waved a hand 
negligently, spilled a handful 
of coins across the table and 
sat down. 

The challenger spun away 
in a screeching shrill of mu- 
sic. Retief caurht his eye for 
an instant as he passed. 

And then the dancer stood 
rigid before the brocaded ta- 
ble — and the music stopped 
off short as the sabre slammed 
down before a heavy Yill in 
ornate metallic coils. The 
challenged Yill rose and 
raised a fist. The other ducked 
his head, put his hands on his 
helmet. Coins rolled. The 
dancer moved on. 



Twice more the dancer 
struck the table in ritualistic 
challenge, exchanged gestures, 
bent his neck and passed on. 
He circled the broad floor, 
sabre twirling, arms darting 
in an intricate symbolism. 
The orchestra blared shrilly, 
unmuffled now by the surf- 
roar of conversation. The Yill, 
Retief noticed suddenly, were 
sitting silent, watching. The 
dancer was closer now, and 
then he was before Retief, 
poised, towering, sabre above 
his head. 

The music cut, and in the 
startling instantaneous si- 
lence, the heavy sabre 
whipped over and down with 
an explosive concussion that 
set dishes dancing on the ta- 
ble-top. 

T he Yiirs eyes held on 
Retief's. In the silence, 
Magnan tittered drunkenly. 
Retief pushed back his stool. 

“Steady, my boy,*' Ambas- 
sador Spradley called. Retief 
stood, the Yill topping his six 
foot three by an inch. In a 
motion almost too quick to 
follow, Retief reached for the 
sabre, tw’'itched it from the 
Yill's grip, swung it in a whis- 
tling cut. The Yill ducked, 
sprang back, snatched up a 
sabre dropped by another 
dancer. 

“Someone stop the mad- 
man!” Spradley howled. 

Retief leaped across the ta- 
ble, sending fragile dishes 
spinning. 

The other danced back, and 



THE YILLIAN WAY

only then did the orchestra 
spring to life with a screech 
and a mad tattoo of high- 
pitched drums. 

Making no attempt to fol- 
lowing the weaving pattern of 
the Yill bolero, Retief pressed 
the other, fending off vicious 
cuts with the blunt weapon, 
chopping back relentlessly. 
Left hand on hip, Retief 
matched blow for blow, driv- 
ing the other back. 

Abruptly, the Yill aban- 
doned the double role. Danc- 
ing forgotten, he settled down 
in earnest, cutting, thrusting, 
parrying; and now the two 
stood toe to toe, sabres clash- 
ing in a lightning exchange. 
The Yill gave a step, two, 
then rallied, drove Retief 
back, back — 

And the Yill stumbled. His 
sabre clattered, and Retief 
dropped his point as the other 
wavered past him and crashed 
to the floor. 

The orchestra fell silent in 
a descending wail of reeds. 
Retief drew a deep breath and 
wiped his forehead. 

‘^Come back here, you young 
fool!'’ Spradley called 
hoarsely. 

Retief hefted the sabre, 
turned, eyed the brocade- 
draped table. He started across 
the floor. The Yill sat as if 
paralyzed. 

‘‘Retief, no I’’ Spradley 
yelped. 

Retief walked directly to 
the Admirable F’Kau-Kau- 
Kau, stopped, raised the sabre. 

“Not the chief of state,** 
Id 



someone in the Terrestrial 
mission groaned. 

Retief whipped the sabre 
down. The dull blade split the 
cloth and clove the hardwood 
table. There was utter silence. 

The Admirable F’Kau-Kau- 
Kau rose, seven feet of obese 
gray Yill. Broad face expres- 
sionless to any Terran eyes, 
he raised a fist like a jewel- 
studded ham. 

Retief stood rigid for a 
long moment. Then, graceful- 
ly, he inclined his head, 
placed his finger tips on his 
temples. 

Behind him, there was a 
clatter as Ambassador Sprad- 
ley collapsed. Then the Ad- 
mirable F'Kau-Kau-Kau cried 
out and reached across the ta- 
ble to embrace the Terrestrial, 
and the orchestra went mad. 

Gray hands helped Retief 
across the table, stools were 
pushed aside to make room at 
F'Kau-Kau-Kau's side. Retief 
sat, took a tall flagon of coal- 
black brandy pressed on him 
by his neighbor, clashed glass- 
es with The Admirable and 
drank. 

IV 

R etief turned at the 
touch on his shoulder. 
“The Ambassador wants to 
speak to you, Retief," Mag- 
nan said. 

Retief looked across to 
where Ambassador Spradley 
sat glowering behind the plain 
tablecloth. 

“Under the circumstances," 
by Koith Laumer 




Retief said, better ask 

him to come over here.” 

“The ambassador?” Mag- 
nan’s voice cracked. 

‘'Never mind the protocol,” 
Retief said. “The situation is 
still delicate.” Magnan went 
away. 

“The feast ends,” F’Kau- 
Kau-Kau said. “Now you and 
I, Retief, must straddle the 
Council Stool.” 

“I’ll be honored. Admi- 
rable,” Retief said. “I must in- 
form my colleagues.” 

“Colleagues?” F’Kau-Kau- 
Kau said. “It is for chiefs to 
parley. Who shall speak for a 
king while he yet has tongue 
for talk?” 

“The Yill way is wise,” 
Retief said. 

F’Kau-Kau-Kau emptied a 
squat tumbler of pink beer. 
“I will treat with you, Retief, 
as viceroy, since as you say 
your king is old and the space 
between worlds is far. But 
there shall be no scheming un- 
derlings privy to our deal- 
ings.” He grinned a Yill grin. 
“Afterwards we shall carouse, 
Retief. The Council Stool is 
hard and the waiting hand- 
maidens delectable. This 
makes for quick agreement.” 

Retief smiled. “The king is 
wise.” 

“Of course, a being prefers 
wenches of his own kind,” 
F’Kau-Kau-Kau said. He 
belched. “The Ministry of 
Culture has imported several 
Terry — excuse me, Retief — 
Terrestrial joy-girls, said to 
be top-notch specimens. At 
THE YILLIAN WAY 



least they have very fat 
watchamacallits.” 

“The king is most consid- 
erate,” Retief said. 

“Let us to it then, Retief. 
I may hazard a fling with one 
of your Terries, myself. I 
fancy an occasional perver- 
sion.” F’Kau-Kau-Kau dug an 
elbow into Retief’s side and 
bellowed with laughter. 

Ambassador Spradley hur- 
ried to intercept Retief as he 
crossed to the door at F’Kau- 
Kau-Kau’s side. 

“Retief, kindly excuse your- 
self. I wish a word with you.” 
His voice was icy. Magnan 
stood behind him, goggling. 

“Mr. Ambassador, forgive 
my apparent rudeness,” Retief 
said. “I don’t have time to 
explain now — ” 

“Rudeness!” Spradley 
barked. “Don’t have time, eh? 
Let me tell you — ” 

“Lower your voice, Mr. 
Ambassador,” Retief said. 

Spradley quivered, mouth 
open, speechless. 

“If you’ll sit down and wait 
q u i e 1 1 y,” Retief said, “I 
think—” 

“You think r Spradley 
spluttered. 

^^qiLENCE!” Retief said. 

Spradley looked up at 
Retief’s face. He stared for a 
moment into Retief’s gray 
eyes, closed his mouth and 
swallowed. 

“The Yill seem to have 
gotten the impression I’m in 
charge,” Retief said. “We’ll 
have to keep it up.’* 



19 




‘‘But— but — ” S p r a d 1 e y 
stuttered. Then he straight- 
ened. “That is the last straw/’ 
he whispered hoarsely. “/ am 
the Terrestrial Ambassador 
Extraordinary and Minister 
Plenipotentiary. Magnan has 
told me that we’ve been stud- 
iedly insulted, repeatedly, 
since the moment of our ar- 
rival. Kept waiting in bag- 
gage rooms, transported in 
refuse lorries, herded about 
with servants, offered swill 
at table. Now I and my senior 
staff, are left cooling our 
heels, without so much as an 
audience while this — this 
multiple Kau person hobnobs 
with — with — ” 

Spradley’s voice broke. “I 
may have been a trifle hasty, 
Retief, in attempting to re- 
strain you. Blaspheming the 
native gods and dumping the 
banquet table are rather ex- 
treme measures, but your re- 
sentment was perhaps partial- 
ly justified. I am prepared to 
be lenient with you.” He 
fixed a choleric eye on Re- 
tief. 

‘T am walking out of this 
meeting, Mr. Retier. I’ll take 
no more of these deliberate 
personal — ” 

“That’s enough,” Retief 
snapped. “You’re keeo’nc- the 
king waiting. Get back to 
your chair and sit there until 
I come back.’' 

Snradley’s face purpled. 

“One more word, and I'll 
silence you forcibly,” Retief 
said. 

Magnan found his voice. 
20 



“What are you going to do, 
Retief?” 

“I’m going to handle the ne- 
gotiation,” Retief said. He 
handed Magnan his empty 
glass. “Now go sit down and 
work on the Image.” 

A t his desk in the VIP 
suite aboard the orbiting 
Corps vessel, Ambassador 
Spradley pursed his lips and 
looked severely at Vice-Con- 
sul Retief. 

“Further,” he said, “you 
have displayed a complete 
lack of understanding of 
Corps discipline, the respect 
due a senior agent, even the 
basic courtesies. Your aggra- 
vated displays of temper, ill- 
timed outbursts of violence 
and almost incredible arro- 
gance in the assumption of 
authority make your further 
retention as an officer-agent 
of the Diplomatic Corps im- 
possibV. It will therefore be 
my unhappy duty to recom- 
mend your immediate — ’ 
There was a muted buzz 
from the communicator. The 
ambassador cleared his tliroat. 
“V/eli ?” 

“A signal from Sector HQ, 
Mr. Ambassador,” a voice 
said. 

“V/ell, read it,” Spradley 
snapped. “Skip the prelimi- 
naries.” 

“Congratulations on the 
unprecedented success of 
your mission. The articles of 
agreement transmitted by 
you embody a most favorable 
resolution of the difficult

Sirenian situation, and will 
form the basis of continued 
amicable relations between 
the Terrestrial States and the 
Yill Empire. To you and your 
staff, full credit is due for a 
job v/ell done. Signed, Dep- 
uty Assistant Secretary — ” 

Spradley cut off the voice 
impatiently. 

He shuffled papers, eyed 
Retief sharply. 

‘‘Superficially, of course, 
an uninitiated observer might 
leap to the conclusion that 
the — ah — results that were 
produced in spite of these... 
ah. .irregularities justify the 
latte r.'" The Ambassador 
smiled a sad, wise smile. 
“This is far from the case,“ 
he said. “I— 

The communicator burped 
softly. 

“Confound it !“ Spradley 
muttered. “Yes?’* 

“Mr. T’Cai-Cai has ar- 
rived,*’ the voice said. “Shall 
I— “ 

“Send him in at once.” 
Spradley glanced at Retief. 
“Only a two-syllable man, 
but I shall attempt to correct 
these false impressions, make 
some amends. 

The two Terrestrials wait- 
ed silently until the Yill Pro- 
tocol chief tapped at the 
door. 

“I hope,” the ambassador 
said, “that you will resist the 
impulse to take advantage of 
your unusual position.” He 
looked at the door. “Come 
in.” 

T’Cai-Cai stepped into the 

THE YILLIAN WAY 



room, glanced at Spradley, 
turned to greet Retief in vol- 
uble Yill. He rounded the 
desk to the ambassador’s 
chair, motioned him from it 
and sat down. 

have a surprise for you, 
A Retief,” he said, in Ter- 
ran. “I myself have made use 
of the teaching machine you 
so kindly lent us.” 

“That’s fine, T’Cai-Cai,’' 
Retief said. “I’m sure Mr, 
Spradley will be interested in 
hearing what we have to say.” 
“Never mind,” the Yill 
said. “I am here only social- 
ly.” He looked around the 
room. 

“So plainly you decorate 
your chamber. But it has a 
certain austere charm.” He 
laughed a Yill laugh. 

“Oh, you are a strange 
breed, you Terrestrials. You 
surprised us all. You know, 
one hears such outlandish 
stories. I tell you in confi- 
dence, we had expected you 
to be overpushes.” 

“Pushovers,” Spradley said, 
tonelessly. 

“Such restraint! What 
pleasure you gave to those of 
us, like myself of course, who 
appreciated your grasp of 
protocol. Such finesse! How 
subtly you appeared to ig- 
nore each overture, while 
neatly avoiding actual con- 
tamination. I can tell you, 
there were those who thought 
— poor fools — that you had no 
grasp of etiquette. How grati- 
fied we were, we profession- 

21 




als, who could appreciate 
your virtuosity — when you 
placed matters on a comfort- 
able basis by spurning the 
cats’-meat. It was sheer pleas- 
ure then, waiting, to see what 
form your compliment would 
take/’ 

The Yill offered orange 
cigars, stuffed one in his nos- 
tril. 

‘T confess even I had not 
hoped that you would honor 
our Admirable so signally. 
Oh, it is a pleasure to deal 
with fellow professionals, 
who understand the meaning 
of protocol !” 

Ambassador Spradley made 
a choking sound. 

“This fellow has caught a 
chill,” T’Cai-Cai said. He 
eyed Spradley dubiously. 
“Step back, my man. I am 
highly susceptible. 

“There is one bit of busi- 



ness I shall take pleasure in 
attending to, my dear Re- 
tief,” T’Cai-Cai went on. He 
drew a large paper from his 
reticule. “The Admirable is 
determined than none other 
than yourself shall be ac- 
credited here. I have here my 
government’s exequatur con- 
firming you as Terrestrial 
consul-general to Yill. We 
shall look forward to your 
prompt return.” 

Retief looked at Spradley. 

“I’m sure the Corps will 
agree,” he said. 

“Then I shall be going,” 
T’Cai-Cai said. He stood up. 
“Hurry back to us, Retief. 
There is much that I would 
show you of Yill.” 

“I’ll hurry,” Retief said 
and, with a Yill wink: “To- 
gether we shall see many 
high and splendid things!”

AN 

INCIDENT ON 
ROUTE 12 



By JAMES H. SCHMITZ 

P HIL Garfield was thirty 
miles south of the little 
town of Redmon on Route 
Twelve when he was startled 
by a series of sharp, clanking 
noises. They came from un- 
der the Packard’s hood. 

The car immediately began 
to lose speed. Garfield 
jammed down the accelerator, 
had a sense of sick helpless- 
ness at the complete lack of 
response from the motor. The 
Packard rolled on, getting rid 
of its momentum, and came 
to a stop. 

Phil Garfield swore shak- 
ily. He checked his watch, 
switched off the headlights 
and climbed out into the dark 
road. A delay of even half an 
hour here might be disas- 
trous. It was past midnight. 



and he had another hundred 
and ten miles to cover to 
reach the small private air- 
field where Madge waited 
for him and the thirty thou- 
sand dollars in the suitcase 
on the Packard’s front seat. 

If he didn’t make it before 
daylight. 

He thought of the bank 
guard. The man had made a 
clumsy play at being a hero, 
and that had set off the fool 
woman who’d run screaming 
into their line of fire. One 
dead. Perhaps two. Garfield 
hadn’t stopped to look at an 
evening paper. 

But he knew they were 
hunting for him. 

He glanced up and down 
the road. No other headlights 
in sight at the moment, no 



23 




light from a building show- 
ing on the forested hills. He 
reached back into the car and 
brought out the suitcase, his 
gun, a big flashlight and the 
box of shells which had been 
standing beside the suitcase. 
He broke the box open, 
shoved a handful of shells 
and the .38 into his coat pock- 
et, then took suitcase and 
flashlight over to the shoul- 
der of the road and set them 
down. 

There was no point in grop- 
ing about under the Pack- 
ard’s hood. When it came to 
mechanics, Phil Garfield was 
a moron and well aware of it. 
The car was useless to him 
now. .except as bait. 

But as bait it might be very 
useful. 

Should he leave it standing 
where it was? No, Garfield 
decided. To anybody driving 
past it would merely suggest 
a necking party, or a drunk 
sleeping off his load before 
continuing home. He might 
have to wait an hour or more 
before someone decided to 
stop. He didn’t have the time. 
He reached in through the 
window, hauled the top of the 
steering wheel towards him 
and put his weight against 
the rear window frame. 

The Packard began to move 
slowly backwards at a slant 
across the road. In a minute 
or two he had it in position. 
Not blocking the road entire- 
ly, which would arouse im- 
mediate suspicion, but an- 
gled across it, lights out, 
24 



empty, both front doors open 
and inviting a passerby’s in- 
vestigation. 

Garfield carried the suit- 
case and flashlight across the 
right-hand shoulder of the 
road and moved up among the 
trees and undergrowth of the 
slope above the shoulder. 
Placing the suitcase between 
the bushes, he brought out the 
.38, clicked the safety off 
and stood waiting. 

Some ten minutes later, a 
set of headlights appeared 
speeding up Route Twelve 
from the direction of Red- 
mon. Phil Garfield went 
down on one knee before he 
came within range of the 
lights. Now he was complete- 
ly concealed by the vegeta- 
tion. 

The car slowed as it ap- 
proached, braking nearly to a 
stop sixty feet from the 
stalled Packard. There were 
several people inside it; Gar- 
field heard voices, then a 
woman’s loud laugh. The 
driver tapped his horn inquir- 
ingly twice, moved the car 
slowly forward. As the head- 
lights went past him, Gar- 
field got to his feet among 
the bushes, took a step down 
towards the road, raising the 
gun. 

Then he caught the distant 
gleam of a second set of 
headlights approaching from 
Redmon. He swore under his 
breath and dropped back out 
of sight. The car below him 
reached the Packard, edged 
cautiously around' it, rolled 

by James H. Schmitz 




on with a sudden roar of ac- 
celeration. 

T he second car stopped 
when still a hundred yards 
away, the Packard caught in 
the motionless glare of its 
lights. Garfield heard the 
steady purring of a powerful 
motor. 

For almost a minute, noth- 
ing else happened. Then the 
car came gliding smoothly on, 
stopped again no more than 
thirty feet to Garfield’s left. 
He could see it now through 
the screening bushes — a big 
job, a long, low four-door se- 
dan. The motor continued to 
purr. After a moment, a door 
on the far side of the car 
opened and slammed shut. 

A man walked quickly out 
into the beam of the head- 
lights and started towards 
the Packard. 

Phil Garfield rose from 
his crouching position, the 
.38 in his right hand, flash- 
light in his left. If the driver 
was alone, the thing was now 
cinched! But if there was 
somebody else in the car, 
somebody capable of fast, de- 
cisive action, a slip in the 
next ten seconds might cost 
him the sedan, and quite 
probably his freedom and 
life. Garfield lined up the 
.38’s sights steadily on the 
center of the approaching 
man’s head. He let his breath 
out slowly as the fellow came 
level with him in the road 
and squeezed off one shot. 
Instantly he went bounding 



down the slope to the road. 
The bullet had flung the man 
sidev/ays to the pavement. 
Garfield darted past him to 
the left, crossed the beam of 
the headlights, and was in 
darkness again on the far 
side of the road, snapping on 
his flashlight as he sprinted 
up to the car. 

The motor hummed quietly 
on. The flashlight showed the 
seats empty. Garfield dropped 
the light, jerked both doors 
open in turn, gun pointing 
into the car’s interior. Then 
he stood still for a moment, 
weak and almost dizzy with 
relief. 

There was no one inside. 
The sedan was his. 

The man he had shot 
through the head lay face 
down on the road, his hat 
flung a dozen feet away from 
him. Route Twelve still 
stretched out in dark silence 
to east and west. There 
should be time enough to 
clean up the job before any- 
one else came along. Gar- 
field brought the suitcase 
down and put it on the front 
seat of the sedan, then start- 
ed back to get his victim off 
the road and out of sight. He 
scaled the man’s hat into the 
bushes, bent down, grasped 
the ankles and started to haul 
him towards the left side of 
the road where the ground 
dropped off sharply beyond 
the shoulder. 

The body made a high, 
squealing sound and began to 
writhe violently. 



AN INCIDENT ON ROUTE TWELVE 



25 




S HOCKED, Garfield 
dropped the legs and hur- 
riedly took the gun from his 
pocket, moving back a step. 
The squealing noise rose in 
intensity as the wounded 
man quickly flopped over 
twice like a struggling fish, 
arms and legs sawing about 
with startling energy. Gar- 
field clicked off the safety, 
pumped three shots into his 
victim’s back. 

The grisly squeals ended 
abruptly. The body continued 
to jerk for another second or 
twj, then lay still. 

Garfield shoved the gun 
back into his pocket. The un- 
expected interruption had un- 
nerved him; his hands shook 
as he reached down again for 
the stranger’s ankles. Then 
he jerked his hands back, and 
straightened up, staring. 

From the side of the man’s 
chest, a few inches below the 
right arm, something like a 
thick black stick, three feet 
long, protruded now through 
the material of the coat. 

It shone, gleaming wetly, 
in the light from the car. 
Even in that first uncom- 
prehending instant, soipie- 
thing in its appearance 
brought a surge of sick dis- 
gust to Garfield’s throat. 

hen the stick bent slowly 
halfway down its length, 
forming a sharp angle, and 
its tip opened into what 
could have been three blunt, 
black claws which scrabbled 
clumsily against the pave- 
ment. Very faintly, the 
26 



squealing began again, and 
the body’s back arched up as 
if another sticklike arm were 
pushing desperately against 
the ground beneath it. 

Garfield acted in a blur of 
horror. He emptied the .38 
into the thing at his feet al- 
most without realizing he 
was doing it. Then, dropping 
the gun, he seized one of the 
ankles, ran backwards to the 
shoulder of the road, drag- 
ging the body behind him. 

In the darkness at the edge 
of the shoulder, he let go of 
it, stepped around to the oth- 
er side and with two franti- 
cally savage kicks sent the 
body plunging over the shoul- 
der and down the steep slope 
beyond. He heard it crash 
through the bushes for some 
seconds, then stop. He turned, 
and ran back to the sedan, 
scooping up his gun as he 
went past. He scrambled into 
the driver’s seat and slammed 
the door shut behind him. 

His hands shook violently 
on the steering wheel as he 
pressed down the acceler- 
ator. The motor roared into 
life and the big car surged 
forward. He edged it past 
the Packard, cursing aloud in 
horrified shock, jammed 
down the accelerator and 
went flashing up Route 
Twelve, darkness racing be- 
side and behind him. 

W ^HAT had it been? Some- 
thing that wore what 
seemed to be a man’s body 
like a suit of clothes, moving 

by James H.' Schmitz 




the body as a man moves, 
driving a ma>i’s car . roach- 
armed, roach-legged itself! 

Garfield drew a long, shud- 
dering breath. Then, as he 
slowed for a curve, there was 
a spark of reddir.h light in the 
rear-view mirror. 

He stared at the spark for 
an instant, braked the car to 
a stop, rolled down the win- 
dow and looked back. 

Far behind him along 
Route Twelve, a fire burned. 
Approximately at the point 
where the Packard had 
stalled out, where something 
had gone rolling off the road 
into the bushes . 

Something, Garfield added 
mentally, that found fiery 
automatic des":niction when 
death came to it, so that its 
secrets would remain unre- 
vealed. 

But for him the fire meant 
the end of a nightmare. He 
rolled the window up, took 
out a cigarette, lit it, and 
pressed the accelerator. 

In incredulous fright, he 
felt the nose of the car tilt 
upwards, headlights sweeping 
up from the road into the 
trees. 

Then the headlights winked 
out. Beyond the windshield, 
dark tree braiiches floated 
down towards him, the night 
sky beyond. He reached fran- 



★ ★★★★★★★ 



tically for the door handle. 

A steel wrench clamped si- 
lently about each of his 
arms, drawing them in against 
his sides, immobilizing them 
there. Garfield gasped, 
looked up at the mirror and 
saw a pair of faintly gleam- 
ing red eyes watching him 
from the rear of the car. Two 
of the things... the second 
one stood behind him out of 
sight, holding him. They’d 
been in what had seemed to 
be the trunk compartment. 
And they had come out. 

The eyes in the mirror 
vanished. A moist, black 
roach-arm reached over the 
back of the seat beside Gar- 
field, picked up the cigarette 
he had dropped, extino-uished 
it with i*ather horribly hu- 
man motions, then took up 
Garfield’s gun and drew back 
out of sight. 

He expected a shot, but 
none came. 

One doesn’t fire a bullet 
through the suit one intends 
to wear. 

It wasn’t until that thought 
occurred to him that tough 
Phil Garfield began to 
scream. He was still scream- 
ing minutes later when, be- 
yond the windshield, the 
spaceship floated into view 
among the stars.

R emember, a few years 
ago, the brilliant work 
done by a graduate student 
who duplicated Earth’s pri- 
m o r d i a 1 atmosphere, shot 
“lightning” through it, and 
came up with a “soup” which 
contained amino acids, the 
basic substances of life? A 
Dr. Carl Sagan has recently 
done somewhat the same with 
the known substances of Ju- 
piter’s atmosphere. He flood- 
ed them with ultraviolet light. 
The result, he says, “would 
create the conditions neces- 
sary for complex pre-biologi- 
cal organic reactions.” He 
theorizes that due to induced 
infra-red under the clouds, Ju- 
piter may be a comfortable 70® 
or so, with seas of ammonia or 
even water. Let’s go find out. 

In 1948, on the little island 

28 



of Bimini, less than half an 
hour by air from Miami, the 
American Museum of Natural 
History founded the Lerner 
Marine Laboratory. Long the 
happy hunting ground for 
sport fishermen, Bimini is 
now attracting scientists from 
all over the world. Mr. Mi- 
chael Lerner, who donated the 
land and houses to start the 
project, is associated with the 
Museum’s renowned Dr. 
James Oliver and one-time s-f 
writer Philip (When Worlds 
Collide) Wylie. One of the 
many things being studied 
there is — of all things — can- 
cer, which afflicts birds and 
amphibia, as well as fish. Can- 
cer is after all a phenome- 
non of chemically-directed 
growth, and the teeming wa- 
ters of Bimini offer simple 
animals with life-cycles per-

fectly suited for the study of 
inherited characteristics over 
many brief generations. Oth- 
ers have the mysterious power 
to grow new limbs — and to 
stop the growth when it’s 
finished. Still others produce 
poisons — which is to say, 
drugs. And sea water itself is 
known to kill certain strains 
of the stubborn staphylococ- 
cus. So keep an eye on jBimini. 

Add to the list of subatomic 
particles (if you haven’t lost 
count by now) the omega, an 
elusive little beauty which 
hangs around for all of ten 
sextillionths of a second. It 
took a specially designed com- 
puter to scan 2500 photo- 
graphs of the star-shaped col- 
lision tracks resulting from 
anti-proton collisions with 
protons in the U. of Cal.’s 
bevatron. 93 of the ‘‘stars’^ 
showed the predicted slight 
curvature indicating that 
sometimes the proton breaks 
into five instead of four pi 
mesons — two positive, two 
negative, and one with no 
charge at all. This latter is the 
short-lived omega. 

At last falVs Conference on 
High Energy Accelerators, 
the boys decided to think big 
— real big. An international

Brookhaven’s monstrous 33

machines with outputs all the 
way up to a trillion e-v, and 



even higher. Such a machine 
might cost upwards of $700

If we call it a nutria, you 
might recognize it as the

but a great number of other 
things we couldn’t possibly

imported from their native 
Argentina about 30 years ago 
by farmers who wanted to get 
into the skin trade. Then 
nutria got (a) unfashionable 
and (b) loose in the swamps of 
East Anglia. Now there are 
thousands of them, lacking na-

THE 



LAST PLACE 
ON EARTH 



By JIM HARMON 

I 

S AM Collins flashed the un- 
dertaker a healthy smile, 
hoping it wouldn’t depress 
old Candle too much. He sa- 
luted. The skeletal figure in 
endless black nodded gravely, 
and took hold of Sam Collins’ 
arm with a death grip. 

‘T’m going to bury you, 
Sam Collins,” the undertak- 
er said. 

The tall false fronts of 
Main Street spilled out a lake 
of shadow, a canal of liquid 
heat that soaked through the 
iron weave of Collins’ jeans 
and turned into black ink 
stains. The old window of the 
hardware store showed its 
age in soft wrinkles, ripples 
that had caught on fire in the

sunset. Collins felt the twi- 
light stealing under the arms 
of his tee-shirt. The overdue 
hair on the back of his rangy 
neck stood up in attention. 
It was a joke, but the first 
one Collins had ever known 
Doc Candle to make. 

‘Tn time, I guess you’ll 
bury me all right. Doc.” 

“In my time, not yours, 
Earthling.” 

^‘Earthling?” Collins re- 
peated the last word. 

The old man frowned. His 
face was a collection of lines. 
When he frowned, all the 
lines pointed to hell, the 
grave, decay and damnation. 

“Earthling,” the undertaker 
repeated. “Earthman? Ter- 
restrial? Solarian? Space 
Ranger? Homo sapiens?*" 



30 




Collins decided Candle was 
sure in a jokey mood. ‘‘Kind 
of makes you think of it, 
don't it, Doc? The spaceport 
going right up outside of 
town. Rocketships are going 
to be out there taking off for 
the Satellite, the Moon, places 
like that. Reminds you that 
we are Earthlings, like they 
say in the funnies, all right.” 
“Not outside town.” 
“What?” 

“Inside. Inside town. Part 
of the spaceship administra- 
tion building is going to go 
smack in the middle of where 
your house used to be.” 

“My house is/* 

“For less time than you will 
be yourself. Earthling.” 
“Earthling yourself ! What's 
wrong with you. Doc?” 

“No. I am not an Earthling. 
I am a superhuman alien from 
outer space. My mission on 
Earth is to destroy you.” 

C OLLINS pulled away gen- 
tly. When you lived in a 
town all your life and knew its 
people, it wasn’t unusual to 
see some old person snap un- 
der the weight of years. 

“You have to destroy the 
rocketship station, huh. Doc, 
before it sends up space- 
ships?” 

“No. I want to kill you. 
That is my mission.” 

“Because,” Candle said, “I 
am a basically evil entity.” 
The undertaker turned 
away and went skithering 
down Main Street, his lop-

sided gait limping, sliding, 
hopping, skipping, at a re- 
fined leisurely pace. He was 
a collection of dancing, 
straight black lines. 

Collins stared after the old 
man, shook his head and for- 
got about him. 

He moved into the hard- 
ware store. The bell tinkled 
behind him. The store was 
cramped with shadows and the 
smell of wood and iron. It 
was lined off as precisely as 
a checkerboard, with counters, 
drawers, compartments. 

Ed Michaels sat behind the 
counter, smoking a pipe. He 
was a handsome man, looking 
young in the uncertain light, 
even at fifty. 

“Hi, Ed. You closed?” 
“Guess not, Sam. What are 
you looking for?” 

“A pound of tenpenny 
nails.” 

Michaels stood up. 

Sarah Comstock v^addled 
energetically out of the back. 
Her sweet, angelic face lit up 
with a smile. “Sam Collins. 
Well, I guess you* 11 want to 
help us murder them.” 

“Murder?” Collins repeat- 
ed. “Who?” 

“Those Air Force men who 
want to come in here and 
cause all the trouble.” 

“How are you going to 
murder them, Mrs. Corn- 
stock?” 

“When they see our peti- 
tion in Washington, D.C., 
they'll call those men back 
pretty quick.” 

“Oh,” Collins said. 



31 




Mrs. Comstock produced 
the scroll from her volumi- 
nous handbag. “You want to 
sign, don’t you? They’re go- 
ing to put part of the airport 
on your place. They’ll tear 
down your house.” 

“They can’t tear it down. I 
won’t sell.” 

“You know government 
men. They’ll just take it and 
give you some money for it. 
Sign right there at the top of 
new column, Sam.” 

Collins shook his head. “I 
don’t believe in signing 
things. They can’t take what’s 
mine.” 

“But Sam, dear, they wilL 
They’ll come in and push 
your house down with those 
big tractors of theirs. They’ll 
bury it in concrete and set off 
those guided missiles of theirs 
right over it.” 

"‘They can’t make me get 
out,” Sam said. 

E d Michaels scooped up a 
pound, one ounce of nails 
and spilled them onto his 
scale. He pinched off the ex- 
cess, then dropped it back in 
and fed the nails into a brown 
paper bag. He crumpled the 
top and set it on the counter, 
“That’s twenty-nine plus one, 
Sam. Thirty cents.” 

Collins laid out a quarter 
and a nickel and picked up 
the bag. “Appreciate you do- 
ing this after store hours, 
Ed.” 

Michaels chuckled. “I 
wasn’t exactly getting ready 
for the opera, Sam.” 

32 



Collins turned around and 
saw Sarah Comstock still 
waiting, the petition in her 
hand. 

“Now what s a pretty girl 
like you doing, wasting her 
time in politics?” Collins 
heard himself ask. 

Mrs. Comstock twittered. 
“I’m old enough to be your 
mother, Sam Collins.” 

“I like mature women.” 

Collins v/atched his hand 
in fascination as it reached 
out to touch one of Sarah 
Comstock’s plump cheeks, 
then dropped to her shoulder 
and ripped away the strap- 
sleeve of her summer print 
dress. 

A plump, rosy shoulder was 
revealed, splattered with 
freckles. 

Sarah Comstock put her 
hands over her ears as if to 
keep from hearing her own 
shrill scream. It reached out 
into pure soprano range. 

Sarah Comstock backed 
away, into the shadows, and 
Sam Collins followed her, 
trying to explain, to apolo- 
gize. 

“Sam! Samr 

The voice cut through to 
him and he looked up. 

Ed Michaels had a doublo- 
barreled shotgun aimed at 
him, Mrs. Michaels’ face was 
looking over his shoulder in 
the door to the, back, her face 
a sick white. 

“You get out of here, Sam,” 
Michaels said. “You get out 
and don’t you come back. 
Ever.”

Collins’ hands moved emp- 
tily in air. He was always 
better with his hands thw 
words, but this time even 
they seemed inexpressive. 

He crumpled the sack of 
nails in both fists, and turned 
and left the hardware store. 

II 

H IS house was still there, 
sitting at the end of Elm 
Street, at the end of town, on 
the edge of the prairie. It 
was a very old house. It was 
decorated with gingerboard, 
a rusted-out tin rooster-comb 
running the peak of the roof 
and stained glass window 
transoms; and the top of the 
house was joined to the 
ground floor by lapped fish- 
scales, as though it was a 
mermaid instead of a house. 
The house was a golden 
house. It had been painted 
brown against the dust, but 
the keening wind, the relent- 
less sun, the savage rape of 
the thunderstorms, they had 
all bleached the brown paint 
into a shining pure gold, 

Sam stepped inside and 
leaned back against the front 
door, the door of full-length 
glass with a border of glass 
emeralds and rubies. He 
leaned back and breathed 
deep. 

The house didn’t smell old. 
It smelled new. It smelled 
like sawdust and fresh-hewn 
lumber as bright and blond 
as a high school senior’s 
crewcut. 



He walked across the flow- 
ered carpet. The carpet didn’t 
mind footsteps or bright sun. 
It never became worn or 
faded. It grew brighter with 
the years, the roses turning 
redder, the sunflowers be- 
coming yellower. 

The parlor looked the same 
as it always did, clean and 
waiting to be used. The cane- 
backed sofa and chairs eager- 
ly waiting to be sat upon, the 
bead-shaded kerosene lamps 
ready to burst into light. 

Sam went into his work- 
shop. This had once been the 
ground level master bedroom, 
but he had had to make the 
change. The work table held 
its share of radios, toasters, 
TV sets, an electric train, 
a spring-wind Victrola. Sam 
threw the nails onto the table 
and crossed the room, running 
his fingers along the silent 
keyboard of the player piano. 
He looked out the window. 
The bulldozers had made the 
ground rectangular, level and 
brown, turning it into a gi- 
gantic half-cent stamp. He 
remembered the mail and 
raised the window and 
reached down into the mail- 
box. It was on this side of 
the house, because only this 
side was technically within 
city limits. 

As he came up with the 
letters, Sam Collins saw a 
man sighting along a plumb- 
line towards his house. He 
shut the window. 

Some of the letters didn’t 
have any postage stamps, just 



THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



33 




a line of small print about a 
$300 fine. Government letters. 
He went over and forced 
them into the tightly packed 
coal stove. All the trash would 
be burned out in the cold 
weather. 

Collins sat down and looked 
through the rest of his mail. 
A new catalogue of electron- 
ic parts. A bulky envelope 
with two paperback novels 
by Richard S. Prather and 
Robert Bloch he had ordered. 
A couple of letters from 
hams. He tossed the mail on 
the table and leaned back. 

H e thought about what 
had happened in the 
hardware store. 

It wasn’t surprising it had 
happened to him. Things like 
that were bound to happen to 
him. He had just been lucky 
that Ed Michaels hadn’t 
called the sheriff. What had 
got into him? He had never 
been a sex maniac before ! 
But still... it was hardly un- 
expected. 

Might as well wait to start 
on those rabbit cages until 
tomorrow, he decided. This 
evening he felt like exploring. 

The house was so big, and 
packed with so many things 
that he never found and ex- 
amined them all. Or if he 
did, he forgot a lot about the 
things between times, so it 
was like reading a favorite 
book over again, always dis- 
covering new things in it. 

The parlor was red in the 
fading light, and the hall be- 
34 



yond the sliding doors was 
deeply shadowed. In the sew- 
ing room, he remembered, in 
the drawers of the treadle 
machine the radio was cap- 
tured. The rings and secret 
manuals of the days when 
radio had been alive. He 
hadn’t looked over those 
things in some little time. 

He looked up the shadowed 
stairway. He remembered the 
night, a few weeks before 
Christmas when he had been 
twelve and really too old to 
believe, his mother had said 
she was going up to see if 
Santa Claus had left any 
packages around a bit early. 
They often gave him his pres- 
ents early, since they were 
never quite sure he would 
live until Christmas. 

But his mother had been 
playing a trick on him. She 
hadn’t been going up after 
packages. She had gone up 
those stairs to murder his 
father. 

She had shot him in the 
back of the head with his 
Army Colt .45 from the first 
war. Collins never quite un- 
derstood why the hole in 
back was so neat and the one 
in front where it came out 
was so messy. 

After he went to live with 
Aunt Amy and the house had 
been boarded up, he heard 
them talking. Aunt Amy and 
her boy friend, fat Uncle 
Ralph. And they had said his 
mother had murdered his 
father because he had gone 
ahead and made her get preg-

nant again and she was afraid 
it would be another one like 
Sam. 

Sam Collins knew she must 
have planned it a long time 
in advance. She had filled up 
the bathtub with milk, real 
milk, and she went in after 
she had done it and took a 
bath in the milk. Then she 
slit her wrists. 

When Sam Collins had run 
down the stairs, screaming, 
and barged into the bathroom, 
he had found the tub looking 
like a giant stick of pepper- 
mint candy. 

A unt Amy had been good 
to him. 

Because he didn’t talk for 
about a year after he found 
the bodies, most people 
thought he was simple-mind- 
ed. But Aunt Amy had al- 
ways treated him just like a 
regular boy. That was embar- 
rassing sometimes, but still 
it was better than what he 
got from the others. 

The doctor hadn’t wanted 
to perform the operation on 
his clubfoot. He said it would 
be an unproductive waste of 
his time and talent, that he 
owed it to the world to use 
them to the very best advan- 
tage. Finally he agreed. The 
operation took about thirty 
seconds. He stuck a knife 
into Sam’s foot and went 
snick-smck. A couple of 
weeks later, his foot was 
healed and it was just like 
anybody else's. Aunt Amy 
had paid him $500 in pay-> 

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



ments, only he returned the 
money order for the last fif- 
ty dollars and wished them 
Merry Christmas. 

Sam Collins could work 
after that. When Aunty Amy 
and Uncle Ralph disappeared, 
he opened up the old house 
and started doing odd jobs 
for people who weren’t very 
afraid of him any more. 

That first day had been 
quite a shock, when he dis- 
covered that not in all these 
years had anybody cleaned 
the bathtub. 

Sometimes, when he was 
taking his Saturday night 
soaker he still got kind of a 
funny feeling. But he knew 
it was only rust from the 
faucets, 

Collins sighed. It seemed 
like a long time since he had 
seen his mother coming down 
those stairs... 

He stopped, his throat 
aching with tightness. 

Something was very 
strange. 

His mother was coming 
down the stairs right now. 

She was walking down the 
stairs, one step, two steps, 
coming closer to him. 

Collins ran up the stairs, 
prepared to run through the 
phantom to prove it wasn’t 
there. 

The figure raised a gun 
and pointed it at him. 

This time, she was going to 
shoot him. 

It figured. 

He always had bad luck. 

**Stop!” the woman on the 



35 




stairs said. "Stop or I'll 
shoot, Mr. Collins !" 

C OLLINS stopped, catch- 
ing to the bannister. He 
squinted hard, and as a ster- 
eoptic slide lost its depth 
when you shut one eye, the 
woman on the stairs was no 
longer his mother. She was 
young, pretty, brunette and 
sweet-faced, and the gun she 
held shrunk from an old 
Army Colt to a .22 target pis- 
tol. 

"Who are you?" Collins 
demanded. 

The girl took a grip on the 
gun with both hands and held 
it steady on him. 

"I’m Nancy Comstock," 
she said. "You tried to as- 
sault my mother a half hour 
ago." 

"Oh," he said. "I’ve never 
seen you before." 

"Yes, you have. I’ve been 
away to school a lot, but 
you’ve seen me around. I’ve 
had my eye on you. I know 
about men like you. I know 
what has to be done. I came 
looking for you in your 
house for this." 

The bore of the gun was 
level with his eye as he stood 
a few steps below her. Prob- 
ably if she fired now, she 
would kill him. Or more like- 
ly he would only be blinded 
or paralyzed; that was about 
his luck. 

"Are you going to use 
that gun?" he asked. 

"Not unless I have to. I 
only brought it along for pro- 

3€ 



tection. I came to help you. 
Mr. Collins." 

"Help me?" 

^ ^^Yes, Mr. Collins. You’re 
sick. You need help." 

He looked the girl over. 
She was a half-dozen years 
younger than he was. In most 
states, she couldn’t even vote 
yet. But still, maybe she 
could help, at that. He didn’t 
know much about girls and 
their abilities. 

"Why don’t we go into the 
kitchen and have some cof- 
fee?" Collins suggested. 

Ill 

N ancy sipped her coffee 
and kept her eyes on his. 
The gun lay in her lap. The 
big kitchen was a place for 
coffee, brown and black, wood 
ceiling and iron stove and 
pans. Collins sat across the 
twelve square feet of table 
from her, and nursed the 
smoking mug. 

"Sam, I want you to take 
whatever comfort you can 
from the fact that I don’t 
think the same thing about 
you as the rest of Waraxe." 

"What does the rest of the 
town think about me?" 

"They think you are a 
pathological degenerate who 
should be lynched. But I 
don’t believe that.” 

"Thanks. That’s a big com- 
fort." 

"I know what you were af- 
ter when you tore Mom’s 
dress." 

In spite of himself. Collins

felt his face warming in a 
blush. 

“You were only seeking the 
mother love you missed as a 
boy,” the girl said. 

Collins chewed on his lip a 
moment, and considered the 
idea. Slowly he shook his 
head. 

“No,” he said. “No. I don’t 
think so.” 

“Then what do you think ?” 

“I think old Doc Candle 
made me do it. He said he 
was going to bury me. Get- 
ting me lynched would be 
one good way to do it. Ed 
Michaels almost blew my 
head off with his shotgun. It 
was close. Doc Candle almost 
made it. He didn’t miss by 
far with you and that target 
pistol either.” 

“Sam — I may call you 
‘Sam’? — just try to think 
calmly and reasonably for a 
minute. How could Dr. Can- 
dle, the undertaker, possibly 
make you do a thing like you 
did in Mr. Michaels’ hard- 
ware store?” 

“Well... he said he was a 
superhuman alien from outer 
space.” 

“If he said that, do you be- 
lieve him, Sam?” 

Something made me do 
that. It just wasn’t my own 
idea.” 

“It’s easier that way, isn’t 
it, Sam?” Nancy asked. “It’s 
easy to say. Tt wasn’t me ; 
some space monster made me 
do it.’ But you really know 
better, don’t you, Sam? Don’t 
take the easy way out! You’ll 

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



only get deeper and deeper 
into your makebelieve world. 
It will be like quicksand. Ad- 
mit your mistakes — face up 
to them — lick them/" 

Collins stood up, and came 
around the end of the table. 

“You’re too pretty to be so 
serious all the time,” he said. 

QAM, I want to help you. 

Please don’t spoil it by 
misinterpreting my inten- 
tions.” 

“You should get a little 
fun out of life,” Collins lis- 
tened to himself say. 

He came on around the big 
table tov/ards her. 

The first time he hadn’t 
realized what was happening, 
but this time he knew. Some- 
body was pulling strings and 
making him jump. He had as 
much control as Charlie Mc- 
Carthy. 

“Don’t come any closer, 
Sam.” 

Nancy managed to keep 
her voice steady, but he could 
tell she was frightened. 

He took another step. 

She threw her coffee in his 
face. 

The liquid was only luke- 
warm but the sudden dash 
had given him some aware- 
ness of his own body again, 
like the first sound of the 
alarm faintly pressing through 
deep layers of sleep. 

“Sam, Sam, please don’t 
make me do it! Please, Sam, 
don"tr 

Nancy had the gun in her 
hand, rising from her chair. 

37 




His hands wanted to grab 
her clothes and tear. 

But that's suicide, he 
screamed at his body. 

As his hand went up with 
the intention of ripping, he 
deflected it just enough to 
shove the barrel of the gun 
away from him. 

The shot went off, but he 
knew instantly that it had 
not hit him. 

The gun fell to the floor, 
and with its fall, something 
else dropped away and he was 
in command of himself again. 

Nancy sighed, and slumped 
against him, the left side of 
her breast suddenly glossy 
with blood. 

E d Michaels stared at him. 

Both eyes unblinking, just 
staring at him. He had only 
taken one look at the girl 
lying on the floor, blood all 
over her chest. He hadn’t 
looked back. 

‘T didn’t know who else to 
call, Ed.” Collins said. ‘‘Sher- 
iff Thurston being out of 
town and all.” 

“It’s okay, Sam. Mike 
swore me in as a special 
deputy a couple years back. 
The badge is at the store.” 
“They’ll hang me for this, 
won’t they, Ed?” 

Michaels put his hand on 
Collins’ shoulder. “No, they 
won’t do that to you, boy. We 
know you around here. They’ll 
just put you away for a 
while.” 

“The asylum at Hannah, 
huh?” 

38 



“Damn it, yes! What did 
you expect? A marksman 
medal?” 

“Okay, Ed, okay. Did you 
call Doc Van der Lies like 
I told you when I phoned?” 
Michaels took a folded 
white handkerchief from his 
pocket and wiped his square- 
jawed face. “You sure are 
taking this calm, Sam. I’m 
telling you, Sam, it would 
look better for you if you at 
least acted like you were sor- 
ry. Doc Van der Lies is up 
in Wisconsin with Mike. I 
called Doc Candle.” 

“He’s an undertaker,” Col- 
lins whispered. 

“Don’t you expect we need 
one?” Michaels asked. Then 
as if he wasn’t sure of the 
answer to his own question, 
he said, “Did you examine 
her to see if she was dead? 
I — I don’t know much about 
v/omen. I wouldn’t be able to 
tell.” 

It didn’t sound like a very 
good excuse to Collins. 

“I guess she’s dead,” Col- 
lins said. “That’s the way he 
must have wanted it.” 

**He? Wait a minute, Sam. 
You mean you’ve got one of 
those split personalities like 
that girl on TV the other 
night? There’s somebody else 
inside you that takes over and 
makes you do things?” 

“I never thought of it just 
like that before. I guess that’s 
one way to look at it.” 

The knock shook the back 
door before Michaels could 
say anything. The door 



by Jim Harmon 




opened and Doc Candle slith- 
ered in disjointedly, a rolled- 
up stretcher over his shoul- 
der. 

‘‘Hello, boys,” Candle said. 
“A terrible accident, it brings 
sorrow to us all. Poor Nancy. 
Has the family been noti- 
fied?” 

“Good gosh, I forgot about 
it,” Michaels said. “But may- 
be we better wait until you 
get her — arranged, huh. Doc?” 

44^UITE so.” The old man 
laid the canvas stretch- 
er out beside the girl on 
the floor and unrolled it. He 
flipped the body over expert- 
ly like a window demonstrat- 
or flipping a pancake over 
on a griddle. 

“Ed, if you’d just take the 
front. I’ll carry the rear. My 
vehicle is in the alley.” 

“Sam, you carry that end 
for Doc. You’re a few years 
younger.” 

Collins wanted to say that 
he couldn’t, but he didn’t 
have enough yet to argue 
with. He picked up the 
stretcher and looked down at 
the white feet in the Scotch 
plaid slippers. 

Candle opened the door and 
waited for them to go 
through. 

The girl on the stretcher 
parted her lips and rolled her 
head back and forth, a puz- 
zled expression of pain on her 
face. 

Collins nearly dropped the 
stretcher, but he made him- 
self hold on tight* 

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



“Ed! Doc! She moved! 
She’s still alive** 

“Cut that out now, Sam,” 
Ed Michaels snapped. “Just 
carry your end.” 

“She’s alive,” Collins in- 
sisted. “She moved again. 
Just turn around and take a 
look, Ed. That’s all I ask.” 

“I hefted this thing once, 
and that’s enough. You move, 
Sam. I’ve got a .38 in my belt, 
and I went to Rome, Italy, 
for the Olympics about the 
time you were getting your- 
self born, Sam. I ought to be 
able to hit a target as big as 
you. Just go ahead and do as 
you’re told.” 

Collins turned desperately 
towards Candle. Maybe Nan- 
cy had been right, maybe he 
had been imagining things. 

“Doc, you take a look at 
her,” Collins begged. 

The old man vibrated over 
to the stretcher and looked 
down. The girl twisted in 
pain, throwing her head back, 
spilling her hair over the 
head of the stretcher. ^ 
“Rigor mortis,” Doc Can- 
dle diagnosed, with a wink to 
Collins. 

“No, Doc ! She needs a doc- 
tor, blood transfusions ...” 

a^ONSENSE,” Candle 
snapped. “I’ll take her 
in my black wagon up to my 
place, put her in the tiled 
basement. I’ll pump out all 
her blood and flush it down 
the commode. Then I’ll feed 
in Formaldi-Forever Number 
Zero* Formaldi-Forever, for 

at 




the Blush of Death. ‘When 
you think of a Pretty Girl, 
think of Formaldi-Forever, 
the Way to Preserve that 
Beauty.’ Then I’ll take a 
needle and some silk thread 
and just a few stitches on 
the eyelids and around the 
mouth. 

“Doc, will you...?” Mich- 
aels said faintly. 

“Of course. I just wanted 
to show Sam how foolish he 
was in saying the Beloved 
was still alive.” 

Nancy kicked one leg off 
the stretcher and Candle 
picked it up and tucked it 
back in. 

“Ed, if you’d just turn 
around and look” Collins 
said. 

“I don’t want to have to 
look at your face, you mur- 
dering son. You make me, 
you say one more word, and 
I’ll turn around and shoot 
you between the eyes.” 

Doc Candle nodded. Col- 
lins knew then that Michaels 
really would shoot him in 
the head if he said anything 
more, so he kept quiet. 

Candle held the door. They 
managed to get the stretcher 
down the back steps, and 
right into the black panel 
truck. They fitted the stretch- 
er into the special sockets 
for it, and Doc Candle closed 
the double doors and slapped 
his dry palm down on the 
sealing crevice. 

Instantly, there was an an- 
swering knock from inside the 
truck, a dull echo. 

40 



^ipvIDN’T you hear that?” 
Collins asked. 

“Hear what?” Michaels 
said. 

“What are you hearing 
now, Sam?” Candle inquired 
solicitously. 

“Oh. Sure,” Michaels said. 
“Kind of a voice, wasn’t it, 
Sam? Didn’t understand what 
it said. Wasn’t listening too 
close, not like you.” 

Thud-thud-thump-thud, 

“No voice,” Collins whis- 
pered. “That infernal sound, 
don’t you hear it, Ed?” 

“I must hurry along.” the 
undertaker said. “Must get 
ready to work on Nancy, get 
her ready for her parents to 
see.” 

“All right, Doc. I’ll take 
care of Sam.” 

“Where you going to jail 
me, Ed?” Collins asked, his 
eyes on the closed truck 
doors. “In your storeroom 
like you did Hank Petrie?” 

Michaels’ face suddenly be- 
gan to work. “Jail? Jail you? 
Jail’s too good for you. Doc, 
have you got a tow rope in 
that truck?” 

Ed Michaels was the best 
shot in town, probably one 
of the best marksmen in the 
world. He had been in the 
Olympics about thirty years 
ago. He was Waraxe’s one 
claim to fame. But he wasn’t 
a cowboy. He wasn’t a fast 
draw. 

Collins put all of his 
weight behind hie left fist 
and landed it on the point of 
Michaels’ jaw, just the way 

by Jim Harmon 




he used to do when gangs of 
boys jumped onto him. 

Michaels sprawled out, 
spread-eagled. 

Then Collins wanted to 
take the revolver out of Ed’s 
belt, and press it into Ed’s 
hand, curling his fingers 
around the grip and over the 
trigger, and then he wanted 
to shake Ed awake, slap his 
face and shake him. 

Collins spun around, clawed 
open the door to the truck 
cab and threw himself behind 
the steering wheel. 

He stopped wanting to 
make Ed Michaels shoot him. 

He flipped the ignition 
switch, levered the floor shift 
and drove away. 

And he was going to drive 
on and on and on and on. 

And on and on and on. 

IV 

C OLLINS turned onto the 
old McHenty blacktop, his 
foot pressed to the floor- 
boards. Ed Michaels didn’t 
own a car ; he would have to 
borrow one from somebody. 
That would take time. Maybe 
Candle would give him his 
hearse to use to follow the 
Black Rachel. 

Trees, fences, barns whizzed 
past the windows of the 
cab and then the steel link- 
mesh fence took up, the fence 
surrounding the New Kansas 
National Spaceport. Behind 
it, further from town, some 
of the concrete had been 
poured and the horizon was a 



remote, sterile gray sweep. 

The McHenty Road would 
soon be closed to civilian 
traffic. But right now that 
the government wanted people 
to drive along and see that 
the spaceship was nothing 
terrible, nothing to fear. 

The girl, Nancy Comstock, 
was alive in the back. He 
knew that. But he couldn’t 
stop to prove it or to help 
her. Candle would make them 
lynch him first. 

V\^hy hadn’t Candle stopped 
him from getting away? 

He had managed to break 
his control for a second. He 
had done that before when 
he deflected Nancy’s aim. 
But he couldn’t resist Candle 
for long. Why hadn’t Candle 
made him turn around and 
come back? 

Candle’s control of him had 
seemed to stop when he got 
inside the cab of the truck. 
Could it be that the metal 
shield of the cab could pro- 
tect an Earthling from the 
strange mental powers of the 
creature from another planet 
which was inhabiting the 
body of Doc Candle? 

Collins shook his head. 

More likely Candle was do- 
ing this just to get his hopes 
up. He probably would seize 
control of him any time he 
wanted to. But Collins decid- 
ed to go on playing it as if 
he did have some hope, as if 
a shield of metal could pro- 
tect him from Candle’s con- 
trol. Otherwise. .there was 
no otherwise.

C 3LLINS suddenly saw an 
opening. 

The steel mesh fence was 
ruptured by a huge semi- 
trailer truck turned on its 
side. Twenty feet of fence on 
either side was down. This 
was restricted government 
property, but of course space- 
ships were hardly prime mil- 
itary secrets any longer. Re- 
pairs in the fence had not 
been made instantaneously, 
and the wreckage was not 
guarded. 

Collins swerved the wheel 
and drove the old wagon 
across the waffle-plate ob- 
struction, onto the smooth 
tarmac beyond. 

He raced, raced, raced 
through the falling night, not 
sure where he was headed. 

Up above he saw the shel- 
ter of shadows from a cluster 
of half-finished buildings. He 
drove into them and parked. 

Collins sat still for a mo- 
ment, then threw open the 
door and ran around to the 
back of the truck, jerking 
open the handles. 

Nancy fell out into his 
arms. 

‘*What kind of ambulance 
is this?'' she demanded. 'Tt 
doesn't look like an ambu- 
lance. It doesn’t smell like an 
ambulance. It looks like — 
looks like — '’ 

Collins said, “Shut up. Get 
out of there. We’ve got to 
hide." 

“Why?" 

“They think I murdered 



“Murdered me? But I'm 
alive. CanH they see Fm 
alive?" 

Collins shook his head. 'T 
doubt it. I don't know why, 
but I don't think it would be 
that simple. Come with me." 

The blood on her breast 
had dried, and he could see 
it was only a shallow groove 
dug by the bullet. But she 
flinched in pain as she began 
to walk, pulling the muscles. 

They stopped and leaned 
against a half-finished metal- 
lic shed. 

“Where are we? Where are 
you taking me?" 

“This is the spaceport. Now 
shut up." 

“Let me go." 

“No." 

“I’m not dead," Nancy in- 
sisted. “You know I'm not 
dead. I won't press charges 
against you — just let me go 
free." 

“I told you it wasn’t that 
simple. He wants them to 
think you’re dead, and that's 
what they’ll think." 

Nancy passed fingers 
across her eyes. “Who? Who 
are you talking about?" 

“Doc Candle. He won't let 
them know you're alive.” 

Nancy rubbed her forehead 
with both hands. “Sam, you 
don’t know what you’re do- 
ing. You don't — know what 
you’re getting yourself into. 
Just let me show myself to 
someone. They'll know I'm 
not dead. Really they will." 

“Okay," he said. “Let’s find 
somebody.'* 



THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



43 




H e led her toward a more 
nearly completed build- 
ing, showing rectangles of 
light. They looked through 
the windows to see several 
men in uniforms bending over 
blueprints on a desk jury- 
r i g g e d of sawhorses and 
planks. 

“Scun,*' Nancy said, ‘^one of 
those men is Terry Elston. 
He's a Waraxe boy. I went to 
school with him. He’ll know 
me. Let’s go in...” 

”No,” Collins said. ”We 
don’t go in.” 

”But — ” Nancy started to 
protest, but stopped. “Wait. 
He’s coming out.” 

Collins slid along the wall 
and stood behind the door. 
“Tell him who you are when 
he comes out. I’ll stay here.” 
They waited. After a few 
seconds, the door opened. 

Nancy stepped into rec- 
tangle of light thrown on the 
concrete from the window. 

“Terry,” she said. “Terry, 
it’s me — Nancy Comstock.” 
The blue-jawed young man 
in uniform frowned. “Who 
did you say you were? Have 
you got clearance from this 
area?” 

“It’s me, Terry. Nancy. 
Nancy Comstock.” 

Terry Elston stepped front 
and center. “That’s not a very 
good joke. I knew Nancy. 
Hell of a way to die, killed 
by some maniac.” 

“Terry, Fm Nancy. Don’t 
you recognize me?” 

Elston squinted. “You look 
familiar. You look a little like 



Nancy. But you can’t be her, 
because she’s dead.’' 

“I’m here, and I tell you 
I’m not dead.” 

“Nancy’s dead,” Elston re- 
peated mechanically. “Say, 
what are you trying to pull?” 

“Terry, behind you. A ma- 
niac!” 

“Sure,” Elston said. “Sure. 
There’s a maniac behind me.” 

Collins stepped forward 
and hit Elston behind the ear. 
He fell silently. 

Nancy stared down at him. 

“He refused to recognize 
me. He acted like I was crazy, 
pretending to be Nancy Corn- 
stock.” 

“Come on along,” Collins 
urged. “They’ll probably 

shoot us on sight as trespass- 
....... ** 

ers. 

She looked around herself 
without comprehension. 
“Which way?” 

‘^This way.” 

Collins did not say those 
words. 

They were said by the man 
with the gun in the uniform 
like the one worn by Elston. 
He motioned impatiently, 

“This way, this way.” 

priority,” Colonel 
Smith-Boerke said as 
he paced back and forth, gun 
in hand. 

From time to time he 
waved it threateningly at Col- 
lins and Nancy who sat on 
the couch in Smith-Boerke’s 
office. They had been sitting 
for close to two hours. Col- 
lins now knew the Colonel 



by Jim Harmoil 




did not intend to turn him 
over to the authorities. They 
were being held for reasons 
of Smith-Boerke’s own. 

‘'They sneak the ship in 
here, plan for an unscheduled 
hop from an uncompleted 
base — the strictest security 
weVe used in ten or fifteen 
years — and now they cancel 
it. This is bound to get 
leaked by somebody! They'll 
call it off. It’ll never fly 
now.” 

Collins sat quietly. He had 
been listening to this all eve- 
ning. Smith-Boerke had been 
drinking, although it wasn’t 
very obvious. 

Smith-Boerke t u r*n e d to 
Collins. 

“I’ve been waiting for 
somebody like you. Just 
waiting for you to come 
along. And here you are, a 
wanted fugitive, completely 
in my power! Perfect, per- 
fect.” 

Collins nodded to himself. 
Of course. Colonel Smith- 
Boerke had been waiting for 
him. And Doc Candle had 
driven him right to him. It 
was inescapable. He had been 
intended to escape and turn 
up right here all along. 

“What do you want with 
me?” 

Smith-Boerke’s flushed 
face brightened. “You want 
to become a hero? A hero so 
big that all these trumped-up 
charges against you will be 
dropped? It’ll be romantic. 
Back to Lindbergh-to-Paris. 
Tell me, Collins, how would 

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



you like to be the first man 
to travel faster than light?” 
Collins knew there was no 
way out. 

“All right,” he said. 
Smith-Boerke wiped a 
hand across his dry mouth. 

“Project Silver has to come 
off. My whole career depends 
on it. You don’t have any- 
thing to do. Everything’s cy- 
bernetic. Just ride along and 
prove a human being can sur- 
vive. Nothing to it. No hyper- 
drives, none of that kind of 
stuff. We had an engine that 
could go half lightspeed and 
now we’ve made it twice as 
efficient and more. No super- 
stitions about Einstein, I 
hope? No? Good.” 

“I’ll go,” Collins said. “But 
what if I had said ‘no’.” 
Smith-Boerke put the gun 
away in a desk drawer. 

“Then you could have 
walked out of here, straight 
into the MP’s.” 

“Why didn’t they come in 
here after me?” 

“They don’t have security 
clearance for this building.” 
“Don’t leave me alone,” 
Nancy said urgently. “I don’t 
understand what’s happening. 
I feel so helpless. I need 
help.” 

‘‘You’re asking the wrong 
man,” Collins said briefly. 

C OLLINS felt safe when 
the airlock kissed shut its 
metal lips. 

It was not like the house, 
but yet he felt safe, sur- 
rounded by all the compli- 



45 




cated, expensive electronic 
equipment. It was big, solid, 
sterilely gleaming. 

Another thing — he had rea- 
son to believe that Doc Can- 
dle's power could not reach 
him through metal. 

“But I'm not outside," Doc 
Candle said, “I'm in here, 
with you." 

Collins yelled and cursed, 
he tried to pull off the ac- 
celeration webbing and claw 
through the airlock. Nobody 
paid any attention to him. 
Count downs had been auto- 
mated. Smith-Boerke was 
handling this one himself, 
and he cut off the Audio-In 
switch from the spaceship. 
Doc Candle said nothing else 
for a moment, and the space- 
ship, almost an entity itself, 
went on with its work. 

The faster-than-light space- 
ship took off. 

At first it was like any 
other rocket takeoff. 

The glow of its exhaust 
spread over the field of the 
spaceport, then over the hills 
and valleys, and then the 
town of Waraxe, spreading 
illumination even as far as 
Sam Collins’ silent house. 

After a time of being sick, 
Collins lay back and accepted 
this too. 

“That’s right, that’s it," 
Doc Candle said. “Take it 
and die with it. That’s the 
ticket.” 

Collins’ eyes settled on a 
gauge. Three quarters light- 
speed. Climbing. 

Nothing strange^ nothing 



untoward happened when you 
reached lightspeed. It was 
only an arbitrary number. All 
else was superstition. Forget 
it, forget it, forget it. 

Something was telling him 
that. At first he thought it 
was Doc Candle but then he 
knew it was the ship. 

Collins sat back and took it, 
and what he was taking was 
death. It was creeping over 
him, seeping into his feet, 
filling him like liquid does 
a sponge. 

Not will, but curiosity, 
caused him to turn his head. 

He saw Doc Candle. 

The old body was dying. 
He was in the emergency 
seat, broken, a ribbon of 
blood lacing his chin. But 
Doc Candle continued to 
laugh triumphantly in Col- 
lins' head. 

“Why? Why do you have 
to kill me?" Collins asked. 

“Because I am evil.” 

“How do you know you’re 
evil?" 

“They told me soT Candle 
shouted back in the thun- 
dering silence of Death’s 
approach. “They were always 
saying I was bad." 

They. 

C OLLINS got a picture of 
something incredibly old 
and incredibly wise, but long 
unused to the young, clumsy 
gods. Something that could 
mar the molding of a godling 
and make it mortal. 

“Blit I'm not really so very 
bad»” Doc Candle went on.

“I had to destroy, but I 
picked someone who really 
didn’t care if he were de- 
stroyed or not. An almost ab- 
solutely passive human being, 
Sam. You.” 

Collins nodded. 

“And even then,” said the 
superhuman alien from outer 
space, “I could not just de- 
stroy. I have created a work 
of art.” 

“Work of art?” 

“Yes. I have taken your 
life and turned it into a hor- 
ror story, Sam! A chilling, 
demonic, black-hearted hor- 
ror !” 

Collins nodded again. 

LIGHTSPEED. 

There was finally some- 
thing human within Sam Col- 
lins that he could not deny. 
He wanted to live. It wasn’t 
true. He did care what hap- 
pened. 

You do? said somebody. 

He does? asked somebody 
else, surprised, and suddenly 
he again got the image of 
wiser, older creatures, a lit- 
tle ashamed because of what 
they had done to the creature 
named Doc Candle. 

He does, chorused several 
voices, and Sam Collins cried 
aloud: “I do! I want to live!” 
They were just touching 
lightspeed; he felt it. 

This time it was not just 
a biological response. He real- 
ly wanted help. He wanted 
to stay alive. 

From the older, wiser voices 
he got help, though he never 
knew how; he felt the ship 

THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH 



move slipwise under him, and 
then a crash. 

And Doc Candle got help 
too, the only help even the 
older, wiser ones could give 
him. 

T HEY pulled him out of 
the combined wreckage of 
the spaceship and his house. 
Both were demolished. 

It was strange how the 
spaceship Sam Collins was on 
crashed right into his house. 
Ed Michaels recalled a time 
in a tornado when Sy Baxter’s 
car was picked up, lifted 
across town and dropped 
into his living room. 

When the men from the 
spaceport lifted away tons of 
rubble, they found him and 
said, “He’s dead.” 

No, I’m not, Collins 
thought. I’m alive. 

And then they saw that he 
really was alive, that he had 
come through it alive some- 
how, and nobody remembered 
anything like it since the 
airliner crash in ’59. 

A while later, after they 
found Doc Candle’s body and 
c o u r t-m a r t i a 1 e d Smith- 
Boerke, who took drugs, Nan- 
cy was nuzzling him on his 
hospital bed. It was nice, 
but he wasn’t paying much 
attention. 

I’m free, Collins thought as 
the girl hugged him. Free! 
He kissed her. 

Well, he thought while she 
was kissing him back, as 
free as I want to be, anyway.

THE TALKATIVE 

TREE 



Dong vines! Beats all how some plants 
have no manners — but what do you ex- 
pect, when they used to be men! 



A ll things considered — 
the obscure star, the un- 
determined damage to the 
stellar drive and the way the 
small planet’s murky atmos- 
phere defied precision scan- 
ners — the pilot made a rea- 
sonably good landing. Despite 
sour feelings for the space 
service of Haurtoz, steward 
Peter Kolin had to admit that 
casualties might have been 
far worse. 

Chief Steward Slichow led 
his little command, less two 
third-class ration keepers 
thought to have been trapped 
in the lower hold, to a point 
two hundred meters from the 
steaming hull of the Peace 
State, He lined them up as if 
on parade. Kolin made him- 
self inconspicuous. 

4J) 



‘‘Since the crew will be on 
emergency watches repairing 
the damage,” announced the 
Chief in clipped, aggressive 
tones, “I have volunteered my 
section for preliminary scout- 
ing, as is suitable. It may be 
useful to discover temporary 
sources in this area of natural 
foods.” 

Volunteered HIS section! 
thought Kolin rebelliously. 

Like the Supreme Director 
of Haurtoz! Being conscript^ 
ed into this idiotic space fleet 
that never fights is bad 
enough without a tin god on 
jets like Slichow! 

Prudently, he did not ex- 
press this resentment overtly. 

His well-schooled features 
revealed no trace of the idea 
— or of any other idea. The 




Planetary State of Haurtoz 
had been organized some fif- 
teen light-years from old 
Earth, but many of the home 
world's less kindly techniques 
had been employed. Lack of 
complete loyalty to the state 
was likely to result in a siege 
of treatment that left the sub- 
ject suitably ‘'re-personal- 
ized.’^ Kolin had heard of in- 
stances wherein mere unen- 
thusiastic posture had be- 
trayed intentions to harbor 
treasonable thoughts. 

‘‘You will scout in five de- 
tails of three persons each," 
Chief Slichow said. “Every 
hour, each detail will send 
one person in to report, and 
he will be replaced by one of 
the five I shall keep here to 
issue rations." 

Kolin permitted himself to 
wonder when anyone might 
get some rest, but assumed a 
mildly willing look. (Too ea- 
ger an attitude could arouse 
suspicion of disguising an im- 
proper viewpoint.) The main- 
tenance of a proper viewpoint 
was a necessity if the Plane- 
tary State were to survive 
the hostile plots of Earth and 
the latter's decadent colonies. 
That, at least, was the offi- 
cial line. 

Kolin found himself in a 
group with Jak Ammet, a 
third cook, and Eva Yrtok, 
powdered foods storekeeper. 
Since the crew would be eat- 
ing packaged rations during 
repairs, Yrtok could be spared 
to command a scout detail. 

EUich scout ms issued a 

THE TALKATIVE TREE 



rocket pistol and a plastic wa- 
ter tube. Chief Slichow em- 
phasized that the keepers of 
rations could hardly, in an 
emergency, give even the ap- 
pearance of favoring them- 
selves in regard to food. They 
would go without. Kolin 
maintained a standard expres- 
sion as the Chief’s sharp 
stare measured them. 

Yrtok, a dark, lean-faced 
girl, led the way with a quiet 
monosyllable. She carried the 
small radio they would be 
permitted to use for messages 
of utmost urgency. Ammet 
followed, and Kolin brought 
up the rear. 

T O reach their assigned 
sector, they had to climb 
a forbidding ridge of rock 
within half a kilometer. Only 
a sparse creeper grew along 
their way, its elongated leaves 
shimmering with bronze- 
green reflections against a 
stony surface; but when they 
topped the ridge a thick for- 
est was in sight. 

Yrtok and Ammet paused 
momentarily before descend- 
ing. 

Kolin shared their sense of 
isolation. They would be out 
of sight of authority and re- 
sponsible for their own ac* 
tions. It was a strange sensa« 
tion. 

They marched down into 
the valley at a brisk pace, be- 
coming more aware of the 
clouds and atmospheric haze. 
Distant objects seemed 
blurred by the mist, taking on 

4t 




a somber, brooding grayness. 
For all Kolin could tell, he 
and the others were isolated 
in a world bounded by the 
rocky ridge behind them and 
a semi-circle of damp trees 
and bushes several hundred 
meters away. He suspected 
that the hills rising mistily 
ahead were part of a contin- 
uous slope, but could not be 
sure. 

Yrtok led the w?.y along 
the most nearly level ground. 
Low creepers became more 
plentiful, interspersed with 
scrubby thickets of tangled, 
spike-armored bushes. Occa- 
sionally, small flying things 
flickered among the foliage. 
Once, a shrub puffed out an 
enormous cloud of tiny 
spores. 

‘‘Be a job to find anything 
edible here,” grunted Ammet, 
and Kolin agreed. 

Finally, after a longer hike 
than he had anticipated, they 
approached the edge of the 
deceptively distant forest. 
Yrtok paused to examine some 
purple berries glistening dan- 
gerously on a low shrub. Ko- 
lin regarded the trees with 
misgiving. 

“Looks as tough to get 
through as a tropical jungle,” 
he remarked. 



“I think the stuff puts out 
shoots that grow back into 
the ground to root as they 
spread,” said the woman. 
“Maybe we can find a way 
through.” 

In two or three minutes, 
they reached the abrupt bor« 



der of the odd-looking trees. 

Except for one thick 
trunked giant, all of them 
were about the same height. 
They craned their necks to es- 
timate the altitude of the 
monster, but the top was hid- 
den by the wide spread of 
branches. The depths behind 
it looked dark and impenetra- 
ble. 

“We’d better explore along 
the edge,” decided Yrtok. 
“Ammet, now is the time to 
go back and tell the Chief 
which way we’re — Ammet!** 

Kolin looked over his shoul- 
der. Fifty meters away, Am- 
met sat beside the bush with 
the purple berries, utterly 
relaxed. 

“He must have tasted 
some!” exclaimed Kolin. “I’ll 
see how he is.” 

He ran back to the cook and 
shook him by the shoulder. 
Ammet’s head lolled loosely 
to one side. His rather heavy 
features were vacant, lending 
him a doped appearance. Ko- 
lin straightened up and beck- 
oned to Yrtok. 

For some reason, he had 
trouble attracting her atten- 
tion. Then he noticed that she 
was kneeling. 

“Hope she didn’t eat some 
stupid thing too!” he grum- 
bled, trotting back. 

As he reached her, what- 
ever Yrtok was examining 
came to life and scooted into 
the underbrush with a flash 
of greenish fur. All Kolin 
saw was that it had several 
legs too many. 



' H, B. FYFE 




He pulled Yrtok to her 
feet. She pawed at him weak- 
ly, eyes as vacant as Ammet's. 
When he let go in sudden 
horror, she folded gently to 
the ground. She lay comfort- 
ably on her side, twitching 
one hand as if to brush some- 
thing away. 

When she began to smile 
dreamily, Kolin backed away. 

T he comers of his mouth 
felt oddly stiff; they had 
involuntarily drawn back to 
expose his clenched teeth. He 
glanced warily about, but 
nothing appeared to threaten 
him. 

“It’s time to end this scout,” 
he told himself. “It’s danger- 
ous. One good look and I’m 
jetting off! What I need is 
an easy tree to climb.” 

He considered the massive 
giant. Soaring thirty or forty 
meters into the thin fog and 
dwarfing other growth, it 
seemed the most promising 
choice. 

At first, Kolin saw no way, 
but then the network of vines 
clinging to the rugged trunk 
suggested a route. He tried 
his weight gingerly, then be- 
gan to climb. 

“I should have brought 
Yrtok’s radio,” he muttered. 
“Oh, well, I can take it when 
I come down, if she hasn’t 
snapped out of her spell by 
then. Funny... I wonder if 
that green thing bit her.” 
Footholds were plentiful 
among the interlaced lianas, 
Kolin progressed rapidl/« 

THE TALKATIVE TREE 



When he reached the first 
thick limbs, twice head 
height, he felt safer. 

Later, at what he hoped was 
the halfway mark, he hooked 
one knee over a branch and 
paused to wipe sweat from his 
eyes. Peering down, he dis- 
covered the ground to be ob- 
scured by foliage. 

“I should have checked 
from down there to see how 
open the top is,” he mused. 
“I wonder how the view will 
be from up there?” 

“Depends on what you’re 
looking for, Sonny !” some- 
thing remarked in a soughing 
wheeze. 

Kolin, slipping, grabbed 
desperately for the branch. 
His fingers clutched a hand- 
ful of twigs and leaves, which 
just barely supported him un- 
til he regained a grip with 
the other hand. 

The branch quivered resent- 
fully under him. 

“Careful, there!” whooshed 
the eerie voice. “It took me 
all summer to grow those!” 
Kolin could feel the skin 
crawling along his backbone. 
“Who are you?” he gasped. 
The answering sigh of 
laughter gave him a distinct 
chill despite its suggestion of 
amiabilty. 

“Name’s Johnny Ashlew. 
Kinda thought you’d start 
with what I am. Didn’t figure 
you’d ever seen a man grown 
into a tree before.” 

Kolin looked about, seeing 
little but leaves and fog, 

have to climb down^” he 

El 




told himself in a reasonable 
tone. ‘‘It's bad enough that the 
other two passed out without 
me going space happy too.” 

“What's your hurry?” de- 
manded the voice. “I can talk 
to you just as easy all the way 
down, you know. Airholes in 
my bark — I'm not like an 
Earth tree.” 

Kolin examined the bark of 
the crotch in which he sat. It 
did seem to have assorted 
holes and hollov/s in its rough 
surface. 

“I never saw an Earth tree,” 
he admitted. “We came from 
Haurtoz.” 

“Where's that? Oh, never 
mind — some little planet. I 
don't bother with them all, 
since I came here and found 
out I could be anything I 
wanted.” 

“What do you mean, any- 
thing you wanted?” asked 
Kolin, testing the firmness of 
a vertical vine. 

44TUST what I said,” con- 

J tinned the voice, sound- 
ing closer in his ear as his 
cheek brushed the ridged bark 
of the tree trunk. “And, if 
I do have to remind you, it 
would be nicer if you said 
‘Mr. Ashlew,' considering my 
age.” 

“Your age? How old — ?” 

“Can't really count it in 
Earth years any more. Lost 
track. I always figured bein' 
a tree was a nice, peaceful 
life; and when I remembered 
how long some of them live, 
that settled it« Sonny, this 
52 



world ain't all it looks like.” 

“It isn't, Mr. Ashlew?” 
asked Kolin, twisting about 
in an effort to see what the 
higher branches might hide. 

“Nope. Most everything 
here is run by the Life — that 
is, by the thing that first 
grew big enough to do some 
thinking, and set its roots 
down all over until it had 
control. That's the outskirts 
of it down below.” 

“The other trees? That jun- 
gle?” 

“It's more'n a jungle. Son- 
ny. When I landed here, along 
with the others from the 
Arcturan Spark, the planet 
looked pretty empty to me, 
just like it must have to— 
Watch it, there. Boy! If I 
didn’t twist that branch over 
in time, you'd be bouncing off 
my roots right now!” 

“Th-thanks !” grunted Ko- 
lin, hanging on grimly. 

“Doggone vine!” comment- 
ed the windy whisper. **He 
ain’t one of my crowd. Land- 
ed years later in a ship from 
some star towards the center 
of the galaxy. You should 
have seen his looks before 
the Life got in touch with his 
mind and set up a mental field 
to help him change form. He 
looks twice as good as a 
vine !” 

‘’He's very handy,” agreed 
Kolin politely. He groped for 
a foothold. 

“Well. .matter of fact, I 
can't get through to him 
much, even with the Life’s 
mental field helping. Guess 

H. JB. FYFE 




he started living with a dif- 
ferent way of thinking. It 
burns me. I thought of being 
a tree, and then he came along 
to take advantage of it!” 
Kolin braced himself se- 
curely to stretch tiring mus- 
cles. 

“Maybe I’d better stay a 
while,” he muttered. “I don’t 
know where I am.” 

“You’re about fifty feet 
up,” the sighing voice in- 
formed him. “You ought to 
let me tell you how the Life 
helps you change form. You 
don’t have to be a tree.” 
“No?” 

**Uh-uh\ Some of the boys 
that landed with me wanted 
to get around and see things. 
Lots changed to animals or 
birds. One even stayed a man 
—on the outside anyway. 
Most of them have to change 
as the bodies wear out, which 
I don’t, and some made bad 
mistakes tryin’ to be things 
they saw on other planets.” 

“I wouldn’t want to do 
that, Mr. Ashlew.” 

“There’s just one thing. 
The Life don’t like taking 
chances on word about this 
place gettin’ around. It sorta 
believes in peace and quiet. 
You might not get back to 
your ship in any form that 
could tell tales.” 

“Listen!” Kolin blurted 
out. “I wasn’t so much en- 
joying being what I was that 
getting back matters to me!” 
“Don’t like your home plan- 
et, whatever the name was?” 
“H a u r t o z. It’s a rotten 
Tiie Talkatve Tree 



place. A Planetary State! You 
have to think and even look 
' the way that’s standard thir- 
ty hours a day, asleep or 
awake. You get scared to 
sleep for fear you might 
dream treason and they’d find 
out somehow.” 

“Whooeee ! Heard about 
them places. Must be tough 
just to live.” 

Suddenly, Kolin found him- 
self telling the tree about life 
on Haurtoz, and of the offi- 
cially announced threats to 
the Planetary State’s planned 
expansion. He dwelt upon the 
desperation of having no 
place to hide in case of trou- 
ble with the authorities. A 
multiple system of such 
worlds was agonizing to 
imagine. 

S OMEHOW, the oddity of 
talking to a tree wore off. 
Kolin heard opinions spout- 
ing out which he had pru- 
dently kept bottled up for 
years. 

The more he talked and 
stormed and complained, the 
more relaxed he felt. 

“If there was ever a fellow 
ready for this planet,” decid- 
ed the tree named Ashlew, 
“you’re it, Sonny! Hang on 
there while I signal the Life 
by root!” 

Kolin sensed a lack of di- 
rect attention. The rustic 
about him was natural, caused 
by an ordinary breeze. He 
noticed his h2Uids shaking. 

“Don’t know what got into 
me, talking that way to a 

53 




tree,” he muttered. ”If Yrtok 
snapped out of it and heard, 
I’m as good as re-personalized 
right now.” 

As he brooded upon the 
sorry choice of arousing a 
search by hiding where he 
was or going back to bluff 
things out, the tree spoke. 

“Maybe you’re all set. Son- 
ny. The Life has been think- 
in’ of learning about other 
worlds. If you can think of a 
safe form to jet off in, you 
might make yourself a deal. 
How’d you like to stay here?” 
“I don’t know,” said Kolin. 
“The penalty for desertion — ” 
“Whoosh! Who’d fin'd you? 
You could be a bird, a tree, 
even a cloud.” 

Silenced but doubting, Ko- 
lin permitted himself to try 
the dream on for size. 

He considered what form 
might most easily escape the 
notice of search parties and 
still be tough enough to live 
a long time without renewal. 
Another factor slipped into 
his musings: mere hope of es- 
cape was unsatisfying after 
the outburst that had defined 
his fuming hatred for Haurt- 
oz. 

rd better watch myself! he 
thought. Don*t drop diamonds 
to grab at stars! 

“What I wish I could do is 
not just get away but get even 
for the way they make us 
live... the whole danm set-up. 
They could just as easy make 
peace with the Earth colo- 
nies. You know why they 
don’t?” 

54 



“Why?” wheezed Ashlew. 

“They’re scared that with- 
out talk of war, and scouting 
for Earth fleets that never 
come, people would have time 
to think about the way they 
have to live and who’s run- 
ning things in the Planetary 
State. Then the gravy train 
would get blown up — and I 
mean blown up!” 

The tree was silent for a 
moment. Kolin felt the 
branches stir meditatively. 
Then Ashlew offered a sug- 
gestion. 

“I could tell the Life your 
side of it,” he hissed. “Once 
in with us, you can always 
make thinking connections, 
no matter how far away. 
Maybe you could make a deal 
to kill two birds with one 
stone, as they used to say on 
Earth. ..” 

C HIEF Steward Slichow 
paced up and down beside 
the ration crate turned up to 
serve him as a field desk. He 
scowled in turn, impartially, 
at his watch and at the weary 
stewards of his headquarters 
detail. The latter stumbled 
about, stacking and distribu- 
ting small packets of emer- 
gency rations. 

The line of crewmen re- 
leased temporarily from re- 
pair work was transient as to 
individuals but immutable as 
to length. Slichow muttered 
something profane about dis- 
regard of orders as he glared 
at the rocky ridges surround- 
ing the landing place. 

H. B. FYFE 




He was so intent upon plan- 
ning greetings with which to 
favor the tardy scouting par- 
ties that he failed to notice 
the loose cloud drifting over 
the ridge. 

It was tenuous, almost a 
haze. Close examination 
would have revealed it to be 
made up of myriads of tiny 
spores. They resembled those 
cast forth by one of the 
bushes Kolin’s party had 
passed. Along the edges, the 
haze faded raggedly into thin 
air, but the units evidently 
formed a cohesive body. They 
drifted together, approaching 
the men as if taking intelli- 
gent advantage of the breeze. 

One of Chief Slichow’s 
staggering flunkies, stealing 
a few seconds of relaxation 
on the pretext of dumping an 
armful of light plastic pack- 
ing, wandered into the haze. 

He froze. 

After a few heartbeats, he 
dropped the trash and stared 
at ship and men as if he had 
never seen either, A hail from 
his master moved him. 

“Coming, Chief!’’ he called 
but, returning at a moderate 
pace, he murmured, “My 
name is Frazer. I'm a second 
assistant steward. I'll think as 
Unit One.” 

Throughout the cloud of 
spores, the mind formerly 
known as Peter Kolin con- 
gratulated itself upon its 
choice of form. 

Nearer to the original 
shape oi the Life than Ash* 
lew got, he thought. 

TH£ TALKATIVK TREE 



He paused to consider the 
state of the tree named Ash- 
lew, half immortal but rooted 
to one spot, unable to float on 
a breeze or through space it- 
self on the pressure of light. 
Especially, it was unable to 
insinuate any part of itself 
into the control center of an- 
other form of life, as a second 
spore was taking charge of 
the body of Chief Slichow at 
that very instant. 

There are not enough men, 
thought Kolin. Some of me 
must drift through the air^ 
lock. In space, I can spread 
through the air system to the 
command group. 

Repairs to the Peace State 
and the return to Haurtoz 
passed like weeks to some of 
the crew but like brief mo- 
ments in infinity to other 
units. At last, the ship parted 
the air above Headquarters 
City and landed. 

The unit known as Captain 
Theodor Kessel hesitated be- 
fore descending the ramp. He 
surveyed the field, the city 
and the waiting team of in- 
specting officers. 

“Could hardly be better, 
could it?” he chuckled to the 
companion unit called Secur- 
ity Officer Tarth. 

“Hardly, sir. All ready for 
the liberation of Haurtoz.” 
“Reformation of the Plane- 
tary State,” mused the cap- 
tain, smiling dreamily as he 
grasped the handrail. “And 
then — formation of the Plane- 
tary Mind!”

FROM PLYNCK TO PLANCK 



F rom San Francisco, reader 
Kirsten Eaves writes to 
pose a question: 

‘‘Why do people who 
read Philip Wylie read 
Theodore Sturgeon? And 
why do people who read 
all the Lewis Carroll they 
can find read both the 
former?,.. Is there a 
character type that takes 
naturally to this symbio- 
sis of ideas? Are there 
vast crowds of these peo- 
ple? I have never to my 
knowledge met one. Or if 
this character type is just 
a product of your literary 
imagination, what am I?’* 

To answer the last question 
first and work backwards, I 
can only say that 1 invented 



by THEODORE STURGEON 



Reader Eaves to about the 
same degree as (another read- 
er wrote me of this convic- 
tion) I wrote Dianetics, Read- 
er Eaves must therefore an- 
swer her own last question. As 
to the matter of character 
types, I usually hold myself 
against categorizations cate- 
gorically, because of an early 
and deep conviction that peo- 
ple who begin sentences with 
“Redheads are — ” or “Hungar- 
ians are — ” are about to speak 
nonsense. 

Yet as to this matter of 
character type... I think per- 
haps she has something. I 
think she is talking about sci- 
ence fiction people — readers, 
writers, editors. (I purposely 
don’t say fen because the field 
has regular loving readers 



06 




whom even fen wouldn’t call 
fans: is Gilbert Highet a fan? 
or Orville Prescott?) I am 
quite sure, however, that any 
sf con, whether -ference or 
-vention, would afford Reader 
Eaves the experience of — to 
her knowledge — meeting a 
large percentage of people 
who have read what she reads, 
like what she likes and will 
listen, as she mentions else- 
where in her letter, to her re- 
citing The Pohhle Who Has 
No Toes, 

As to the first question, I 
have evidence that Sturgeon 
reads Wylie and I have no 
doubt that Wylie reads Wylie, 
but I have as yet no evidence 
that Wylie reads Sturgeon. 
This is the kind of thing that 
makes me back off from cate- 
gorizations. 

Reader Eaves isn’t through 
with me yet. Since I frequent- 
ly mention books read by peo- 
ple in my stories, and music 
too, she asks, ‘‘Perhaps if you 
can spare the time you can 
write out a more complete 
recommended reading list 
than you include in your sto- 
ries.” I have the time, but not 
the space; however, I am de- 
lighted to be able to mention 
some of the books which my 
characters have found influ- 
ential, and my character as 
well. Some of them fall into 
the class of Books That No- 
body Has Read but Me, or So 
It Seems. It’s hard to love ’em 
so much and find them un- 
known. Others actually do 
have a certain small reader-

chine. Dunsany’s The Char- 
woman*s Shadow. Pangborn’s 
A Mirror for Observers. Ar-

liam Morris’ Golden Wings. 
De Quincy’s The English 
Mail-Coach. Karle Wilson 
Baker’s The Garden of the 
Plynck. .these aren’t all, by 
any means, but I’ve reached 
the one I wanted to talk about. 

I have NEVER met anyone 
who has read the Plynck. It 
was published by Yale Uni- 
versity Press in 1924. It is, if 
you like, a children’s book. 
which, if you like, Alice in 
Wonderland also is. A series 
of adventures of a little girl 
called Sara who has learned 
to “go inside her head and 
shut the doors,” it deals with 
the Garden she finds there, 
and all its wonders. 

Something — and I honestly 
don’t know what — keeps the 
book from being impossibly 
cute. To this day I find it full 
of lovely twists and surprises. 
There’s a curly path just in- 
side the doors (only on a later 
visit it was pink instead of 
curly) which led to the Gar- 
den itself, a pool in which 
there is a tree on which there 
sits the Plynck, a beautiful, 
somewhat haughty, but very 
kind bird. She looks down at 

57 




the water where her Echo 
lives. Fluttering about among 
the branches, more often than 
not, is a Teacup (a widow; her 
Saucer was broken some time 
ago.) There's the Snimmy’s 
wife, who when indignant un- 
screws and angrily hems a 
doorknob, and her pet the 
Snoodle, whose mother was a 
snail and whose father was a 
pedigreed noodle, and who has 
a drawback. The drawback is a 
little isinglass window in his 
back which, when you pick 
him up, draws back and re- 
leases the odor of castor oil. 
There are Zizzes, which fly 
right into dimples unless you 
remove same and put them in 
a dimple-holder. And then 
there’s Avrillia. 

“Has any mortal but Sara 
ever seen Avrillia? Certainly 
there never was another fairy 
so wan and wild and beautiful 
...she was leaning over the 
marble balustrade, looking 
down into Nothing, and one 
hand still stretched out as if 
it had just let something fall. 
She seemed to be still watch- 
ing its descent. Her body, as 
she leaned, was like a reed, 
and her hair was pale-gold 
and cloudy. But all that was 
nothing beside Avrilla’s eyes. 

“...It didn’t stick,” she 
said. 

. “Do you throw your 
poems down there?” asked 
Sara. 

“Of course,” said Avrillia. 
“I write them on rose-leaves 
. petals, I mean, all colors, 
but especially blue. And then 

58 



I drop them over, and some 
day one of them may stick to 
the bottom — ** 

“But there isn’t any!” 

“...But there’s an imagi- 
nary bottom. One might stick 
on that, you know. And then, 
with that to build to, if I drop 
them in very fast, I may be 
able to fill it up— 

“But there aren’t any sides 
to it either!” 

Avrillia betrayed a faint 
exasperation (it showed a lit- 
tle around the edges, like a 
green petticoat under a black 
dress). “Oh, these literal peo- 
ple,” she said, half to her- 
self... “Isn’t it as easy to 
imagine sides as a bottom? 
Well... if I write them fast 
enough to fill it up. .some- 
body a hundred years from 
now may come along and no- 
tice one of my poems; and 
then I shall be Immortal.” 
And at that a lovely smile 
crossed Avrillia’s face. 

^TOW, you either dig this or 
^ ^ you don’t. Me, I never 
write my congressman or try 
a new kind of story or argue 
with a jingoist but I get a 
flash of Avrillia leaning rapt- 
ly over the balustrade. and 
go inside my mind and shut 
the doors is something I com- 
pletely understand. .and out- 
er space, and hydrogen trans- 
formations, and Planck’s Con- 
stant, live there along with 
Schlorge at the dimplesmithy 
— in a world of things to mar- 
vel at, which need not neces- 
sarily be understood. end

B I 

by KURT VONNEGUT, JR. 



E verything was per- 

fcctly swell. 

There were no prisons, no 
slums, no insane asylums, no 
cripples, no poverty, no wars. 

All diseases were con- 
quered. So was old age. 

Death, barring accidents, 
was an adventure for volun- 
teers. 

The population of the Unit- 
ed States was stabilized at 
forty-million souls. 

One bright morning in the 
Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a 
man named Edward K. Weh- 
ling, Jr., waited for his wife 
to give birth. He was the only 
man waiting. Not many peo- 
ple were born a day any more. 

Wehling was fifty-six, a 
mere stripling in a popula- 
tion whose average age was 
one hundred and twenty-nine. 

X-rays had revealed that 
his wife was going to have 
triplets. The children would 
be his first. 

Young Wehling was 
hunched in his chair, his head 
in his hand. He was so rum- 
pled, so still and colorless as 
to be virtually invisible. His 
camouflage was perfect, since 
the waiting room had a dis- 
orderly and demoralized air, 
too. Chairs and ashtrays had 
been moved away from the 
walls. The floor was paved 
with spattered dropcloths. 

The room was being redec- 
orated. It was being redeco- 
rated as a memorial to a man 
who had volunteered to die. 

A sardonic old man, about 
two hundred years old, sat on 



59 




a stepladder, painting a mural 
he did not like* Back in the 
days when people aged visi- 
bly, his age would have been 
guessed at thirty-five or so. 
Aging had touched him that 
much before the cure for ag- 
ing was found. 

The mural he was working 
on depicted a very neat gar- 
den. Men and women in white, 
doctors and nurses, turned 
the soil, planted seedlings, 
sprayed bugs, spread fertili- 
zer. 

Men and women in purple 
uniforms pulled up weeds, 
cut down plants that were old 
and sickly, raked leaves, car- 
ried refuse to trash-burners. 

Never, never, never — not 
even in medieval Holland nor 
old Japan — had a garden been 
more formal, been better tend- 
ed. Every plant had all the 
loam, light, water, air and 
nourishment it could use. 

A hospital orderly came 
down the corridor, singing 
under his breath a popular 
song: 

If you don’t like my kisses, 
honey, 

Here’s what I will do: 

I’ll go see a girl in purple. 

Kiss this sad world toodle- 
oo. 

If you don’t want my lovin’. 

Why should I take up all 
this space? 

I’ll get off this old planet, 

Let some sweet baby have 
my place. 

The orderly looked in at 

60 



the mural and the muralist. 
“Looks so real,” he said, ‘T 
can practically imagine I’m 
standing in the middle of it.” 
“What makes you think 
you’re not in it?” said the 
painter. He gave a satiric 
smile. “It’s called ‘The Hap- 
y Garden of Life,' you 
now.” 

“That’s good of Dr. Hitz,” 
said the orderly. 

H e was referring to one of 
the male figures in white, 
whose head was a portrait of 
Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hos- 
pital’s Chief Obstetrician. 
Hitz was a blindingly hand- 
some man. 

“Lot of faces still to fill 
in,” said the orderly. He 
meant that the faces of many 
of the figures in the mural 
were still blank. All blanks 
were to be filled with por- 
traits of important people on 
either the hospital staff or 
from the Chicago Office of 
the Federal Bureau of Ter- 
mination. 

“Must be nice to be able to 
make pictures that look like 
something,” said the orderly. 

The painter’s face curdled 
with scorn. “You think I’m 
proud of this daub?” he said. 
“You think this is my idea of 
what life really looks like?” 
“What’s your idea of what 
life looks like?” said the or- 
derly. 

The painter gestured at a 
foul dropcloth. “There’s a 
good picture of it,” he said. 
“Frame that, and you’ll have 

by Kurt Vonnegutt Jr. 




a picture a damn sight more 
honest than this one/' 

‘‘You're a gloomy old duck, 
aren't you?" said the orderly. 

“Is that a crime?" said the 
painter. 

The orderly shrugged. “If 
you don’t like it here, Grand- 
pa — ” he said, and he finished 
the thought with the trick 
telephone number that people 
who didn’t want to live any 
more were supposed to call. 
The zero in the telephone 
number he pronounced 
“naught." 

The number was : “2 B R O 
2 B." 

It was the telephone num- 
ber of an institution whose 
fanciful sobriquets included : 
“Automat,” “Birdland," “Can- 
nery,” “Catbox," “De-louser," 
“Easy-go," “Good-by, Moth- 
er," “Happy Hooligan," “Kiss- 
me-quick,” “Lucky Pierre," 
“Sheepdip," “Waring Blen- 
dor," “Weep-no-more" and 
“Why Worry?" 

“To be or not to be" was 
the telephone number of the 
municipal gas chambers of the 
Federal Bureau of Termina- 
tion. 

T he painter thumbed his 
nose at the orderly. 
“When I decide it’s time to 
go,” he said, “it won’t be at 
the Sheepdip." 

“A do-it-yourselfer, eh?" 
j»id the orderly. “Messy bus- 
iness, Grandpa. Why don't 
you have a little considera- 
tion for the people who have 
to clean up after you?" 

2BR02B 



The painter expressed with 
an obscenity his lack of con- 
cern for the tribulations of 
his survivors. “The world 
could do with a good deal 
more mess, if you ask me,” 
he said. 

The orderly laughed and 
moved on. 

Wehling, the waiting fath- 
er, mumbled something with- 
out raising his head. And 
then he fell silent again. 

A coarse, formidable wom- 
an strode into the waiting 
room on spike heels. Her 
shoes, stockings, trench coat, 
bag and overseas cap were all 
purple, the purple the paint- 
er called “the color of grapes 
on Judgment Day." 

The medallion on her pur- 
ple musette bag was the seal 
of the Service Division of the 
Federal Bureau of Termina- 
tion, an eagle perched on a 
turnstile. 

The woman had a lot of fa- 
cial hair — an unmistakable 
mustache, in fact. A curious 
thing about gas-chamber hos- 
tesses was that, no matter 
how lovely and feminine they 
were when recruited, they all 
sprouted mustaches within 
five years or so. 

“Is this where I’m sup- 
posed to come?" she said to 
the painter. 

“A lot would depend on 
what your business was," he 
said. “You aren't about to 
have a baby, are you?” 

“They told me I was sup- 
posed to pose for some pic- 
ture," she said* “My name's 



61 




Leora Duncan/’ She waited. 

“And you dunk people/' he 
said. 

“What?" she said. 

“Skip it," he said. 

“That sure is a beautiful 
picture," she said. “Looks just 
like heaven or something." 

“Or something/* said the 
painter. He took a list of 
names from his smock pocket. 
“Duncan, Duncan, Duncan," 
he said, scanning the list. 
“Yes — here you are. You’re 
entitled to be immortalized. 
See any faceless body here 
you'd like me to stick your 
head on? We’ve got a few 
choice ones left,” 

She studied the mural 
bleakly. “Gee,” she said, 
“they’re all the same to me. 
I don’t know anything about 
art.” 

“A body's a body, eh ?" 
he said “All righty. As a mas- 
ter of fine art, I recommend 
this body here.” He indicated 
a faceless figure of a woman 
who was carrying dried stalks 
to a trash-burner. 

“Well,” said Leora Duncan, 
“that's more the disposal peo- 
ple, isn't it? I mean, Fm in 
service. I don’t do any dis- 
posing.” 

The painter clapped his 
hands in mock delight. “You 
say you don't know anything 
about art, and then you prove 
in the next breath that you 
know more about it than I do ! 
Of course the sheave-carrier 
is wrong for a hostess ! A 
snipper, a pruner — ^that's more 
your line.” He pointed to a 



figure in purple who was 
sawing a dead branch from an 
apple tree. “How about her?" 
he said. “You like her at all?” 

“Gosh — " she said, and she 
blushed and became humble 
— “that — that puts me right 
next to Dr. Hitz.*^ 

“That upsets you?" he said. 

“Good gravy, no!" she said. 
“It’s — it’s just such an honor.” 

“Ah, You admire him, eh?” 
he said. 

“Who doesn’t admire him?” 
she said, worshiping the por- 
trait of Hitz. It was the por- 
trait of a tanned, white- 
haired, omnipotent Zeus, two 
hundred and forty years old. 
“Who doesn't admire him?” 
she said again. “He was re- 
sponsible for setting up the 
very first gas chamber in Chi- 
cago.” 

“Nothing would please me 
more," said the painter, “than 
to put you next to him for all 
time. Sawing off a limb — 
that strikes you as appro- 
priate?" 

“That is kind of like what 
I do,” she said. She was de- 
mure about what she did. 
What she did was make peo- 
ple comfortable while she 
killed them. 

A nd, while Leora Duncan 
was posing for her por- 
trait, into the waitingroom 
bounded Dr. Hitz himself. 
He was seven feet tall, and 
he boomed with importance, 
accomplishments, and the joy 
of living. 

“Well, Miss Duncan! Miss 
fry Kurt .Vonnegul^ Jr. 




Duncan !” he said, and he 
made a joke. “What are you 
doing here?” he said. “This 
isn’t where the people leave. 
This is where they come in !” 

“We’re going to be in the 
same picture together,’^ she 
said shyly. 

“Good!” said Dr. Hitz 
heartily. “And, say, isn’t that 
some picture?” 

“I sure am honored to be 
in it with you,” she said. 

“Let me tell you,” he said, 
“I’m honored to be in it with 
you. Without women like 
you, this wonderful world 
we’ve got wouldn’t be possi- 
ble.” 

He saluted her and moved 
toward the door that led to 
the delivery rooms. “Guess 
what was just born,” he said. 

“I can’t,” she said. 

“Triplets!” he said. 

“Triplets!” she said. She 
was exclaiming over the legal 
implications of triplets. 

The law said that no new- 
born child could survive un- 
less the parents of the child 
could find someone who 
would volunteer to die. Tri- 
plets, if they were all to live, 
called for three volunteers. 

“Do the parents have three 
volunteers?” said Leora Dun- 
can. 

“Last I heard,” said Dr. 
Hitz, “they had one, and were 
trying to scrape another two 
up.” 

“I don’t think they made 
it,” she said. “Nobody made 
three appointments with us. 
Nothing but singles going 

2BR02B 



through today, unless some- 
body called in after I left. 
What’s the name?” 

“Wehling,” said the wait- 
ing father, sitting up, red- 
eyed and frowzy. “Edward K, 
Wehling, Jr., is the name of 
the happy father-to-be.” 

He raised his right hand, 
looked at a spot on the wall, 
gave a hoarsely wretched 
chuckle. “Present,” he said. 

“Oh, Mr. Wehling,” said 
Dr. Hitz, “I didn’t see you.” 

“The invisible man,” said 
Wehling. 

“They just phoned me that 
your triplets have been born,” 
said Dr. Hitz. “They’re all 
fine, and so is the mother. I’m 
on my way in to see them 
now.” 

“Hooray,” said Wehling 
emptily. 

“You don’t sound very hap- 
py,” said Dr. Hitz. 

“What man in my shoes 
wouldn’t be happy?” said 
Wehling. He gestured with 
his hands to symbolize care- 
free simplicity. “All I have 
to do is pick out which one 
of the triplets is going to live, 
then deliver my maternal 
grandfather to the Happy 
Hooligan, and come back 
here with a receipt.” 

D r. Hitz became rather se- 
vere with Wehling, tow- 
ered over him. “You don’t be- 
lieve in population control, 
Mr. Wehling?” he said. 

“I think it’s perfectly 
keen,” said Wehling tautly. 
“Would you like to go back 



B3 




to the good old days, when 
the population of the Earth 
was twenty billion — about to 
become forty bilHon, then 
eighty billion, then one hun- 
dred and sixty billion? Do 
you know what a drupelet is, 
Mr. Wehling?'^ said Hitz. 

“Nope,’* said Wehling sulk- 

ily. 

drupelet, Mr. Wehling, 
is one of the little knobs, 
one of the little pulpy grains 
of a blackberry," said Dr. 
Hitz. "Without population 
control, human beings would 
now be packed on this sur- 
face of this old planet like 
drupelets on a blackberry ! 
Think of itr 

Wehling continued to stare 
at the same spot on the wall. 

"In the year 2000," said Dr. 
Hitz, "before scientists 
stepped in and laid down the 
law, there wasn't even enough 
drinking water to go around, 
and nothing to eat but sea- 
weed — and still people in- 
sisted on their right to re- 
produce like jackrabbits. And 
their right, if possible, to live 
forever." 

"I want those kids," said 
Wehling quietly. “I want all 
three of them." 

"Of course you do," said 
Dr. Hitz. "That’s only hu- 
man." 

"I don’t want my grand- 
father to die, either," said 
Wehling. 

"Nobody’s really happy 
about taking a close relative 
to the Catbox," said Dr. Hitz 
gently, sympathetically. 



**I wish people wouldn’t 
call it that," said Leora Dun- 
can. 

•-What?" said Dr. Hitz. 

•-I wish people wouldn’t 
call it 'the Catbox,’ and things 
like that," she said. "It gives 
people the wrong impres- 
sion." 

"You’re absolutely right,” 
said Dr. Hitz. "Forgive me." 
He corrected himself, gave 
the municipal gas chambers 
their official title, a title no 
one ever used in conversation. 
"I should have said, ‘Ethical 
Suicide Studios,’ " he said. 

"That sounds so much bet- 
ter," said Leora Duncan. 

"This child of yours — 
whichever one you decide to 
keep, Mr. Wehling," said Dr. 
Hitz. "He or she is going to 
live on a happy, roomy, clean, 
rich planet, thanks to popu- 
lation control. In a garden 
like that mural there." He 
shook his head. "Two centur- 
ies ago, when I was a young 
man, it was a hell that nobody 
thought could last another 
twenty years. Now centuries 
of peace and plenty stretch 
before us as far as the imag- 
ination cares to travel." 

He smiled luminously. 

The smile faded as he saw 
that Wehling had just drawn 
a revolver. 

Wehling shot Dr. Hitz 
dead. "There’s room for one 
— a great big one," he said. 

And then he shot Leora 
Duncan. "It’s only death," he 
said to her as she fell. "There ! 
Room for two." . 



by Kurt Vonneguti Jr« 




And then he shot himself, 
making room for all three of 
his children. 

Nobody came running. No- 
body, seemingly, heard the 
shots. 

The painter sat on the top 
of his stepladder, looking 
down reflectively on the sorry 
scene. 

T he painter pondered the 
mournful puzzle of life 
demanding to be born and, 
once born, demanding to be 
fruitful. .to multiply and to 
live as long as possible — to 
do all that on a very small 
planet that would have to last 
forever. 

All the answers that the 
painter could think of were 
grim. Even grimmer, surely, 
than a Catbox, a Happy Hool- 
igan, an Easy Go. He thought 
of war. He thought of plague. 
He thought of starvation. 

He knew that he would 
never paint again. He let his 
paintbrush fall to the drop- 
cloths below. And then he de- 
cided he had had about 
enough of life in the Happy 
Garden of Life, too, and he 
came slowly down from the 
ladder. 

He took Wehling’s pistol, 
really intending to shoot him- 
self. 

But he didn’t have the 
nerve. 

And then he saw the tele- 
phone booth in the corner of 
the room. He went to it, 
dialed the well-remembered 
number: *'2 B R O 2 B.’' 

2BR02B 



‘‘Federal Bureau of Ter- 
mination,” said the very warm 
voice of a hostess. 

“How soon could I get an 
appointment?” he asked, 
speaking very carefully. 

“We could probably fit you 
in late this afternoon, sir,” 
she said. “It might even be 
earlier, if we get a cancella- 
tion.” 

“All right,” said the paint- 
er, “fit me in, if you please.” 
And he gave her his name, 
spelling it out. 

“Thank you, sir,” said the 
hostess. “Your city thanks 
you ; your country thanks 
you; your planet thanks you. 
But the deepest thanks of all 
is from future generations.”

What has gone before: The crew of the starship Orion 
found themselves in the middle of a great space war be- 
tween the creatures called Stretts and the lost android 
servants of their own human ancestors. Helped by the 
androids, the Earthmen formed themselves into the pow- 
erful telepathic linkage called **peyondiid" to invade the 
Strett planet itself. As their minds joined they heard the 



android Tuly cry out, **Good, 
were out in interstellar space. 



X 

H ilton did not have to 
drive the peyondix-beam 
to the planet Strett; it was al- 
ready there. And there was the 
monstrous First Lord Thinker 
Zoyar. 

Into that mind his multi- 
Yhind flashed, its every mem- 
ber as responsive to his will 
as his own fingers — almost in- 
finitely more so, in fact, be- 
cause of the tremendous 
lengths of time required to 
send messages along nerves. 

That horrid mind was 
scanned cell by cell. Then, af- 
ter what seemed like a few 
hours, when a shield began 
sluggishly to form, Hilton 
transferred his probe to the 
mind of the Second Thinker, 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



.** And then their minds 



one Lord Ynos, and absorbed 
ever)rthing she knew. Then, 
the minds of all the other 
Thinkers being screened, he 
studied the whole Stijett plan- 
et, foot by foot, and every- 
thing that was on it. 

Then, mission accomplished, 
Hilton snapped his attention 
back to his office and the 
multi-mind fell apart. As he 
opened his eyes he heard Tuly 

scream: ** Luck!” 

*'Oh — you still here, Tuly? 
How long have we been 
gone?” 

Approximately one and 
one-tenth seconds, sir.” 
‘‘WHAT!” 

Beverly Bell, in the haven 
of Franklin Poynter’s arms, 
fainted quietly. Sandra 
shrieked piercingly. The four 



67 




men stared, goggle-eyed. Tem- 
ple and Teddy, as though by 
common thought, burrowed 
their faces into brawny shoul- 
ders. 

Hilton recovered first. '‘So 
that*s what peyondix is.” 

"Yes, sir — I mean no, sir. 
No, I mean yes, but. .” Tuly 
paused, licking her lips in that 
peculiarly human-female ges- 
ture of uncertainty. 

"Well, what do you mean? 
It either is or isn’t. Or is that 
necessarily so?” 

"Not exactly, sir. That is, it 
started as peyondix. But it be- 
came something else. Not even 
the most powerful of the old 
Masters — nobody— ever did or 
ever could possibly generate 
such a force as that. Or handle 
it so fast.” 

"Well, with seven of the 
best minds of Terra and a. 

"Chip-chop the chit-chat !” 
Karns said, harshly. "What I 
want to know is whether I 
was having a nightmare. Can 
there possibly be a race such 
as I thought I saw? So ut- 
terly savage — ruthless — ^merci- 
less! So devoid of every hu- 
man trace and so hell-bent de- 
termined on the extermination 
of every other race in the Gal- 
axy? God damn it, it simply 
doesn’t make sense P 

E yes went from eyes to 
eyes to eyes. 

All had seen the same in- 
describably horrible, abysmal- 
ly atrocious, things. Qualities 
and quantities and urges and 
drives that no words in any 
68 



language could even begin to 
portray. 

"It doesn’t seem to, but 
there it is.” Teddy Blake 
shook her head hopelessly. 

Big Bill Karns, hands still 
shaking, lit a cigarette before 
he spoke again. “Well, I’ve 
never been a proponent of 
genocide. But it's my consid- 
ered opinion that the Stretts 
are one race the galaxy can 
get along v/ithout.” 

"A hell of a lot better with- 
out,” Poynter said, and all 
agreed. 

"The point is, what can we 
do about it?” Kincaid asked. 
"The first thing, I would say, 
is to see whether we can do 
this — ^whatever it is — ^without 
Tuly’s help. Shall we try it? 
Although I, for one, don’t feel 
like doing it right away.” 

"Not I, either.” Beverly 
Bell held up her right hand, 
which was shaking uncontrol- 
lably. "I feel as though I’d 
been bucking waves, wind 
and tide for forty-eight 
straight hours without food, 
water or touch. Maybe in 
about a week I'll be ready for 
another try at it. But today— 
not a chance !” 

"Okay. Scat, all of you,” 
Hilton ordered. "Take the 
rest of the day off and rest 
up. Put on your thought- 
screens and don’t take them 
off for a second from now on. 
Those Stretts are tough hom- 
bres.” 

Sandra was the last to leave. 
"And you, boss?” she asked, 
pointedly. ,

*^IVe got some thinking to 

dor 

**Vll stay and help yon 
think 

‘‘Not yet.” He shook his 
head, frowned and then 
grinned. “You see, chick, I 
don’t even know yet what it 
is I’m going to have to think 
about.” 

“A bit unclear, but I know 
what you mean — I think. 
Luck, chief.” 

TN their subterranean sanc- 

turn on distant Strett, two 
of the deepest thinkers of that 
horribly unbuman race were 
in coldly intent conference via 
thought. 

“My mind has been plun- 
dered, Ynos,” First Lord 
Thinker Zo3^ar radiated, 
harshly. “Despite the extreme- 
ly high reactivity of my shield 
some information — I do not 
know how much — ^was taken. 
The operator was one of the 
humans of that ship.” 

“I, too, felt a plucking at 
my mind. But those humans 
could not peyondire. First 
Lord.” 

“Be logical, fool! At that 
contact, in the matter of which 
you erred in not following up 
continuously, they succeeded 
in concealing their real abili- 
ties from you.” 

“That could be the truth. 
Our ancestors erred, then, in 
recording that all those weak 
and timid humans had been 
slain. These offenders are 
probably their descendants, 
returning to reclaim their 
former world.” 



“The probability must be 
evaluated and considered. 
Was it or was it not through 
human aid that the Omans de- 
stroyed most of our task- 
force?” 

“Highly probable, but im- 
possible of evaluation with the 
data now available.” 

“Obtain more data at once. 
That point must be and shall 
be fully evaluated and fully 
considered. This entire situa- 
tion is intolerable. It must be 
abated.” 

“True, First Lord. But eve- 
ry operator and operation is 
now tightly screened. Oh, if 
I could only go out there my- 
self. .” 

“Hold, fool! Your thought 
is completely disloyal and un- 
Strettly.” 

“True, oh First Lord Think- 
er Zoyar. I will forthwith re- 
move my unworthy self from 
this plane of existence.” 

“You will not! I hereby 
abolish that custom. Our num- 
bers are too few by far. Too 
many have failed to adapt. 
Also, as Second Thinker, your 
death at this time would be 
slightly detrimental to certain 
matters now in work. I will 
myself, however, slay the un- 
fit. To that end repeat The 
Words under my peyondir- 
ing. 

“I am a Strett. I will devote 
my every iota of mental and 
of physical strength to for- 
warding the Great Plan. I am, 
and will remain, a Strett.” 

“You do believe in The 
V/ords.” 



MASTERS OF SPACE

course I believe in 
them ! I know that in a 
few more hundreds of thou- 
sands of years we will be rid 
of material bodies and will be- 
come invincible and invulner- 
able. Then comes the Con- 
quest of the Galaxy... and 
then the Conquest of the Uni- 
verse !*' 

‘'No more, then, on your 
life, of this weak and coward- 
ly repining ! Now, what of 
your constructive thinking?’' 

“Programming must be such 
as to obviate time-lag. We 
must evaluate the factors al- 
ready mentioned and many 
others, such as the reactiva- 
tion of the spacecraft which 
was thought to have been de- 
stroyed so long ago. After 
having considered all these 
evaluations, I will construct a 
Minor Plan to destroy these 
Omans, whom we have permit- 
ted to exist on sufference, and 
with them that shipload of 
despicably interloping hu- 
mans.” 

“That is well.” Zoyar’s mind 
seethed with a malevolent 
ferocity starkly impossible for 
any human mind to grasp. 
“And to that end?” 

“To that end we must in- 
tensify still more our program 
of procuring data. We must 
revise our mechs in the light 
of our every technological ad- 
vance during the many thou- 
sands of cycles since the last 
such revision was made. Our 
every instrument of power, of 
offense and of defense, must 
be brought up to the theoret- 
70 



ical ultimate of capability. 

“And as to the Great 
Brain?” 

“I have been able to think 
of nothing. First Lord, to add 
to the undertakings you have 
already set forth.” 

“It was not expected that 
you would. Now: is it your 
final thought that these inter- 
lopers are in fact the descen- 
dants of those despised hu- 
mans of so long ago?” 

“It is.” 

“It is also mine. I return, 
then, to my work upon the 
Brain. You will take whatever 
measures are necessary. Use 
every artifice of intellect and 
of ingenuity and our every re- 
source. But abate this intoler- 
able nuisance, and soon.” 

“It shall be done. First 
Lord.” 

T he Second Thinker issued 
orders. Frenzied, round- 
the-clock activity ensued. 
Hundreds of mechs operated 
upon the brains of hundreds 
of others, who in turn operat- 
ed upon the operators. 

Then, all those brains 
charged with the technolog- 
ical advances of many thou- 
sands of years, the combined 
hundreds went unrestingly to 
work. Thousands of work- 
mechs were built and put to 
work at the construction of 
larger and more powerful 
space-craft. 

As has been implied, those 
battle-skeletons of the Stretts 
were controlled by their own 
built-in mechanical brains, 



by Edward E. Smith & E« Everett Evans 




which were programmed for 
only the simplest of battle 
maneuvers. Anything at all 
out of the ordinary had to be 
handled by remote control, by 
the specialist-mechs at their 
two-miles-long control board. 

This was now to be changed. 
Programming was to be made 
so complete that almost any 
situation could be handled by 
the warship or the missile it- 
self — instantly. 

The Stretts knew that they 
were the most powerful, the 
most highly advanced race in 
the universe. Their science 
was the highest in the uni- 
verse. Hence, with every op- 
erating unit brought up to the 
full possibilities of that sci- 
ence, that would be more than 
enough. Period. 

This work, while it re- 
quired much time, was very 
much simpler than the task 
which the First Thinker had 
laid out for himself on the 
giant computer-plus which the 
Stretts called ‘‘The Great 
Brain.” In stating his project. 
First Lord Zoyar had said: 

“Assignment: To construct 
a machine that will have the 
following abilities: One, to 
contain and retain all knowl- 
edge and information fed into 
it, however great the amount. 
Two, to feed itself additional 
information by peyondiring 
all planets, wherever situate, 
bearing intelligent life. Three, 
to call up instantly any and 
all items of information per- 
taining to any problem we 
may give it. Four, to com- 



bine and recombine any num- 
ber of items required to form 
new concepts. Five, to formu- 
late theories, test them and 
draw conclusions helpful to 
us in any matter in work.” 

It will have been noticed 
that these specifications vary 
in one important respect from 
those of the Eniacs and Uni- 
vacs of Earth. Since we of 
Earth can not peyondire, we 
do not expect that ability from 
our computers. 

The Stretts could, and did. 

W HEN Sandra came back 
into the office at five 
o’clock she found Hilton still 
sitting there, in almost exact- 
ly the same position. 

“Come out of it, Jarve!” 
She snapped a finger. “That 
much of that is just simply 
too damned much.” 

“You’re so right, child.” He 
got up, stretched, and by main 
strength shrugged off his foul 
mood. “But we’re up against 
something that is really a 
something, and I don’t mean 
perchance.” 

“How well I know it.” She 
put an arm around him, gave 
him a quick, hard hug. “But 
after all, you don’t have to 
solve it this evening, you 
know.” 

“No, thank God.” 

“So why don’t you and 
Temple have supper with me? 
Or better yet, why don’t all 
eight of us have supper to- 
gether in that bachelors’ para- 
dise of yours and Bill’s?” 
“That’d be fun.” 



MASTERS OF SPACE

And it was. 

Nor did it take a week for 
Beverly Bell to recover from 
the Ordeal of Eight. On the 
following evening, she herself 
suggested that the team should 
take another shot at that ut- 
terly fantastic terra incognita 
of the multiple mind, jolting 
though it had been. 

“But are you sure you can 
take it again so soon?“ Hil- 
ton asked. 

“Sure. I'm like that famous 
gangster’s moll, you know, 
who bruised easy but healed 
quick. And I want to know 
about it as much as anyone 
else does.” 

They could do it this time 
without any help from Tuly. 
The linkage fairly snapped to- 
gether and shrank instantane- 
ously to a point. Hilton 
thought of Terra and there it 
was; full size, yet occupying 
only one infinitesimal section 
of a dimensionless point. The 
multimind visited relatives of 
all eight, but could not make 
intelligible contact. If asleep, 
it caused pleasant dreams; if 
awake, pleasant thoughts of 
the loved one so far away in 
space ; but that was all. It 
visited mediums, in trance and 
otherwise — ^many of whom, 
not surprisingly now, were 
genuine — with whom it held 
lucid conversations. Even in 
linkage, however, the multi- 
mind knew that none of the 
mediums would be believed, 
even if they all told, simul- 
taneously, exactly the same 
story. The multi-mind weak- 



ened suddenly and Hilton 
snapped it back to Ardry. 

Beverly was almost in col- 
lapse. The other girls were 
white, shaken and trembling. 
Hilton himself, strong and 
rugged as he was, felt as 
though he had done two weeks 
of hard labor on a rock-pile. 
He glanced questioningly at 
Larry. 

“Point six three eight sec- 
onds, sir,” the Omans said, 
holding up a millisecond tim- 
er. 

“How do you explain that?** 
Karns demanded. 

“I’m afraid it means that 
without Oman backing we’re 
out of luck.” 

H ilton had other ideas, 
but he did not voice any 
of them until the following 
day, when he was rested and 
had Larry alone. 

“So carbon-based brains 
can’t take it. One second of 
that stuff would have killed 
all eight of us. Why? The 
Masters had the same kind of 
brains we have.” 

“I don’t know, sir. It’s some- 
thing completely new. No 
Master, or group of Masters, 
ever generated such a force 
as that. I can scarcely believe 
such power possible, even 
though I have felt it twice. It 
may be that over the genera- 
tions your individual powers, 
never united or controlled, 
have developed so much 
strength that no human brain 
can handle them in fusion.” 
“And none of us ever knew 



72 



by Edward E« Smith & E« Everett Evans 




anything about any of them. 
IVe been doing a lot of think- 
ing. The Masters had qualities 
and abilities now unknown to 
any of us. How come? You 
Omans — and the Stretts, too — 
think we’re descendants of the 
Masters. Maybe we are. You 
think they came originally 
from Arth — Earth or Terra — 
to Ardu. That’d account for 
our legends of Mu, Atlantis 
and so on. Since Ardu was 
within peyondix range of 
Strett, the Stretts attacked it. 
They killed all the Masters, 
they thought, and made the 
planet uninhabitable for any 
kind of life, even their own. 
But one shipload of Masters 
escaped and came here to 
Ardry — far beyond peyondix 
range. They stayed here for a 
long time. Then, for some rea- 
son or other — ^which may be 
someplace in their records — 
they left here, fully intending 
to come back. Do any of you 
Omans know why they left? 
Or where they went?” 

'"No, sir. We can read only 
the simplest of the Masters’ 
records. They arranged our 
brains that way, sir.” 

'T know. They’re the type. 
However, I suspect now that 
your thinking is reversed. 
Let’s turn it around. Say the 
Masters didn’t come from 
Terra, but from some other 
planet. Say that they left here 
because they were dying out. 
They were, weren’t they?” 
'‘Yes, sir. Their numbers be- 
came fewer and fewer each 
century.” 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



*T was suffc of it. They were 
committing race suicide by 
letting you Omans do every- 
thing they themselves should 
have been doing. Finally they 
saw the truth. In a desperate 
effort to save their race they 
pulled out, leaving you here. 
Probably they intended to 
come back when they had bred 
enough guts back into them- 
selves to set you Omans down 
where you belong. 

“But they were always the 
Masters, sir!” 

“They were not ! They were 
hopelessly enslaved. Think it 
over. Anyway, say they went 
to Terra from here. That still 
accounts for the legends and 
so on. However, they were too 
far gone to make a recovery, 
and yet they had enough fix- 
ity of purpose not to manu- 
facture any of you Omans 
there. So their descendants 
went a long way down the 
scale before they began to 
work back up. Does that make 
sense to you?” 

^^TT explains many things, 

■^sir. It can very well be the 
truth.” 

“Okay. However it was, 
v/e’re here, and facing a con- 
dition that isn’t funny. While 
v/e v/ere teamed up I learned 
a lot, but not nearly enough. 
Am I right in thinking that I 
now don’t need the other sev- 
en at all — that my cells are 
fully charged and I can go it 
alone?” 

“Probably, sir, but ...” 

“I’m coming to that. Every 

73 




time I do it — up to maximum 
performance, of course — it 
comes easier and faster and 
hits harder. So next time, or 
maybe the fourth or fifth 
time, it’ll kill me. And the 
other seven, too, if they’re 
along.” 

*'I’m not sure, sir, but I 
think so.” 

‘‘Nice. Very, very nice.” 
Hilton got up, shoved both 
hands into his pockets, and 
prowled about the room. “But 
can’t the damned stuff be con- 
trolled? Choked — throttled 
down — damped — muzzled, 
some way or other?” 

“We do not know of any 
way, sir. The Masters were al- 
ways working toward more 
power, not less.” 

“That makes sense. The 
more power the better, as long 
as you can handle it. But I 
can’t handle this. And neither 
can the team. So how about 
organizing another team, one 
that hasn’t got quite so much 
whammo? Enough punch to 
do the job, but not enough 
to backfire that way?” 

“It is highly improbable 
that such a team is possible, 
sir.” If an Oman could be 
acutely embarrassed, Larry 
was. “That is, sir... I should 
tell you, sir. .” 

“You certainly should. 
You’ve been stalling all along, 
and now you’re stalled. Spill 
it.” 

“Yes, sir. The Tuly begged 
me not to mention it, but I 
must. When it organized your 
team it had no idea of what 

74 



it was really going to do...” 

“Let’s talk the same lan- 
guage, shall we? Say ‘he’ and 
‘she.’ Not ‘it.’ ” 

“She thought she was set- 
ting up the peyondix, the same 
as all of us Omans have. But 
after she formed in your mind 
the peyondix matrix, your 
mind went on of itself to form 
a something else ; a thing we 
can not understand. That was 
why she was so extremely. 
I think ‘frightened’ might be 
your term.” 

“I knew something was bit- 
ing her. Why?” 

“Because it very nearly 
killed you. You perhaps have 
not considered the effect upon 
us all if any Oman, however 
unintentionally, should kill a 
Master?” 

“No, I hadn’t... I see. So 
she won’t play with fire any 
more, and none of the rest of 
you can?” 

“Yes, sir. Nothing could 
force her to. If she could be 
so coerced we would destroy 
her brain before she could act. 
That brain, as you know, is 
imperfect, or she could not 
have done what she did. It 
should have been destroyed 
long since.” 

“Don’t ever act on that as- 
sumption, L a r r y.” Hilton 
thought for minutes. “Simple 
peyondix, such as yours, is not 
enough to read the Masters’ 
records. If I’d had three brain 
cells working I’d’ve tried them 
then. I wonder if I could read 
them?” 

“You have all the old Mas- 



by Edward E« Smith & Everett Evans 




tcrs’ powers and more. But 
you must not assemble them 
again, sir. It would mean 
death/’ 

"‘But IVe got to know.,, 
Tve got to know! Anyway, a 
thousandth of a second would 
be enough. I don’t think that’d 
hurt me very much.” 

H e concentrated — read a 
few feet of top-secret 
braided wire — and came back 
to consciousness in the sick- 
bay of the Perseus, with two 
doctors working on him; 
Hastings, the top Navy medi- 
co, and Flandres, the surgeon. 

“What the hell happened to 
you?” Flandres demanded. 
“Were you trying to kill your- 
self?” 

“And if so, how?” Hastings 
wanted to know. 

“No, I was trying not to,” 
Hilton said, weakly, “and I 
guess I didn’t much more than 
succeed.” 

“That was just about the 
closest shave I ever saw a man 
come through. Whatever it 
was, don’t do it again.” 

“I won’t,” he promised, feel- 
ingly. 

When they let him out of 
the hospital, four days later, 
he called in Larry and Tuly. 

“The next time would be 
the last time. So there won’t 
be any,” he told them. “But 
just how sure are you that 
some other of our boys or girls 
may not have just enough of 
whatever it takes to do the 
job? Enough oompa, but not 
too much?” 

MASTERS OF 8PACS 



“Since we, too, are on 
strange ground the probability 
is vanishingly small. We have 
been making inquiries, howev- 
er, and scanning. You were se- 
lected from all the minds of 
Terra as the one having the 
widest vision, the greatest 
scope, the most comprehensive 
grasp. The ablest at synthesis 
and correlation and so on.” 

“That’s printing it in big 
letters, but that was more or 
less what they were after.” 

“Hence the probability ap- 
proaches unity that any more 
such ignorant meddling as this 
obnoxious Tuly did well re- 
sult almost certainly in failure 
and death. Therefore we can 
not and will not meddle 
again.” 

^^WOU’VE got a point 
^ there. So what I am is 
some kind of a freak. Maybe 
a kind of super-Master and 
maybe something altogether 
different. Maybe duplicable in 
a less lethal fashion, and may- 
be not. Veree helpful — I don’t 
think. But I don’t want to kill 
anybody, either .. .especially 
if it wouldn’t do any good. 
But we’ve got to do some- 
thing!'" Hilton scowled in 
thought for minutes. “But an 
Oman brain could take it. As 
you told us, Tuly, ‘The brain 
of the Larry is very, very 
tough.’ ” 

“In a way, sir. Except that 
the Masters were very careful 
to make it physically impos- 
sible for any Oman to go very 
far along that line. It was 

76 




only their oversight of my one 
imperfect brain that enabled 
me, alone of us all, to do that 
wrong.” 

“Stop thinking it was 
wrong, Tuly. Tm mighty glad 
you did. But I wasn’t think- 
ing of any regular Oman 
brain...” Hilton’s voice pe- 
tered out. 

“I see, sir. Yes, we can, by 
using your brain as Guide, re- 
produce it in an Oman body. 
You would then have the pow- 
ers and most of the qualities 
of both...” 

“No, you don’t see, because 
I’ve got my screen on. Which 
I will now take off — ” he suit- 
ed action to word — “since the 
whole planet’s screened and I 
have nothing to hide from you. 
Teddy Blake and I both 
thought of that, but we’ll con- 
sider it only as the ultimate- 
ly last resort. We don’t want 
to live a million years. And 
we want our race to keep on 
developing. But you folks can 
replace carbon-based mole- 
cules with silicon-based ones 
just as easily as, and a hell of 
a lot faster than, mineral wa- 
ter petrifies wood. V>^hat can 
you do along the line of re- 
building me that way? And 
if you can do any such con- 
version, what would happen? 
Would I live at all? And if 
so, how long? How would I 
live? What would I live on? 
All that kind of stuff.” 

“Shortly before they left, 
two of the Masters did some 
work on that very thing. Tuly 
and I converted them, sir.” 

76 



“Fine— or is it? How did it 
work out?” 

“Perfectly, sir. .except that 
they destroyed themselves. It 
was thought that they wearied 
of existence.” 

“I don’t wonder. Well, if it 
comes to that, I can do the 
same. You can convert me, 
then.” 

“Yes, sir. But before we do 
it we must do enough pre- 
liminary work to be sure that 
you will not be harmed in any 
way. Also, there will be many 
more changes involved than 
simple substitution.” 

“Of course. I realize that. 
Just see what you can do, 
please, and let me know.” 

“We will, sir, and thank you 
very much.” 

XI 

A S has been intimated, no 
Terran can know what re- 
searches Larry and Tuly and 
the other Oman specialists 
performed, or how they ar- 
rived at the conclusions they 
reached. However, in less than 
a week Larry reported to Hil- 
ton. 

“It can be done, sir, with 
complete safety. And you will 
live even more comfortably 
than you do now.” 

“How long?” 

“The mean will be about 
five thousand Oman years — 
you don’t know that an Oman 
year is equal to one point two 
nine three plus Terran years?” 
“I didn’t, no. Thanks.” 

“The maximum, a little less 



by Edward E. Smith & E, Everett Evans 




than six thousand. The mini- 
mum, a little over four thou- 
sand. I'm very sorry we had 
no data upon which to base 
a closer estimate.” 

‘‘Close enough.” He stared 
at the Oman. “You could also 
convert my wife?” 

“Of course, sir.” 

“Well, we might be able to 
stand it, after we got used to 
the idea. Minimum, over five 
thousand Terran years... bar- 
ring accidents, of course?” 
“No, s i r. No accidents. 
Nothing will be able to kill 
you, except by total destruc- 
tion of the brain. And even 
then, sir, there will be the pat- 
tern.” 

‘Til ... be ... damned ...” 
Hilton gulped twice. “Okay, 
go ahead.” 

“Your skins will be like 
ours, energy-absorbers. Your 
‘blood' will carry charges of 
energy instead of oxygen. 
Thus, you may breathe or not, 
as you please. Unless you 
wish otherwise, we will con- 
tinue the breathing function. 
It would scarcely be worth 
while to alter the automatic 
mechanisms that now control 
it. And you will wish at times 
to speak. You will still enjoy 
eating and drinking, although 
everything ingested will be 
eliminated, as at present, as 
waste.” 

“We'd add uranexite to our 
food, I suppose. Or drink ra- 
dioactives, or sleep under co- 
balt-60 lamps.” 

“Yes, sir. Your family life 
will be normal; your sexual 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



urges and satisfactions the 
same. Fertilization and period 
of gestation unchanged. Your 
children will mature at the 
same ages as they do now.” 

“How do you — oh, I see. 
You wouldn't change any 
molecular linkages or config- 
urations in the genes or 
chromosomes.” 

“We could not, sir, even if 
we wished. Such substitutions 
can be made only in exact one- 
for-one replacements. In the 
near future you will, of 
course, have to control births 
quite rigorously.” 

“We sure would. Let's see 
. say we want a stationary 
population of a hundred mil- 
lion on our planet. Each cou- 
ple to have two children, a 
boy and a girl. Born when the 
parents are about fifty... 
um-m-m. The gals can have 
all the children they want, 
then, until our population is 
about a million; then slap on 
the limit of two kids per cou- 
ple. Right?” 

“Approximately so, sir. And 
after conversion you alone 
will be able to operate with 
the full power of your eight, 
without tiring. You will also, 
of course, be able to absorb al- 
most instantaneously all the 
knowledges and abilities of 
the old Masters.” 

Hilton gulped twice before 
he could speak. “You wouldn't 
be holding anything else back, 
would you?” 

“Noth i n g important, sir. 
Everything else is minor, and 
probably known to you.”

•*I doubt it. How long will 
the job take, and how much 
notice will you need?"* 

“Two days, sir. No notice. 
Everything is ready.” 

Hilton, face somber, thought 
for minutes. ‘The more I 
think of it the less I like it. 
But it seems to be a forced 
put... and Temple will blow 
sky high. .and have I got the 
guts to go it alone, even if 
she"d let me ... ” He shrugged 
himself out of the black mood. 
‘T"ll look her up and let you 
know, Larry.” 

H e looked her up and told 
her everything. Told her 
bluntly; starkly; drawing the 
full picture in jet black, with 
very little white. 

“There it is, sweetheart. 
The works,” he concluded. 
“We are not going to have ten 
years; we may not have ten 
months. So — if such a brain 
as that can be had, do we or 
do we not have to have it? I’m 
putting it squarely up to 
you.” 

Temple’s face, which had 
been getting paler and paler, 
was now as nearly colorless as 
it could become ; the sickly 
yellow of her skin’s light tan 
unbacked by any flush of red 
blood. 

Her whole body was tense 
and strained. 

“There’s a horrible snapper 
on that question. Can’t I do 
it? Or anybody else except 
you?” 

“No. Anyway, whose job is 
it, sweetheart?” 

78 



T know, but... but I know 
just how close Tuly came to 
killing you. And that wasn’t 
anything compared to such a 
radical transformation as this. 
I’m afraid it’ll kill you, dar- 
ling. And I just simply 
couldn’t stand it!” 

She threw herself into his 
arms, and he comforted her in 
the ages-old fashion of man 
with maid. 

“Steady, hon,” he said, as 
soon as he could lift her tear- 
streaked face from his shoul- 
der. “I’ll live through it. I 
thought you were getting the 
howling howpers about having 
to live for six thousand years 
and never getting back to Ter- 
ra except for a Q strictly T 
visit now and then.” 

She pulled away from him, 
flung back her wheaten mop 
and glared. “So that’s what 
you thought! What do I care 
how long I live, or how, or 
where, as long as it’s with 
you? But what makes you 
think we can possibly live 
through such a horrible con- 
version as that?” 

“Larry wouldn’t do it if 
there was any question what- 
ever. He didn’t say it would 
be painless. But he did say I’d 
live.” 

“Well, he knows, I guess 
...I hope.” Temple’s natural 
fine color began to come back. 
“But it’s understood that just 
the second you come out of 
the vat, I go right in.” 

“I hadn’t ought to let you, 
of course. But I don’t think 
I could take it alone.” 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




That statement required a 
special type of conference, 
which consumed some little 
time. Eventually, however, 
Temple answered it in words. 

“Of course you couldn't, 
sweetheart, and I wouldn’t let 
you, even if you could.” 

There were a few things 
that had to be done before 
those two secret conversions 
could be made. There was the 
matter of the wedding, which 
was now to be in quadrupli- 
cate. Arrangements had to be 
made so that eight Big 
Wheels of the Project could 
all be away on honeymoon at 
once. 

All these things were done. 

O F the conversion opera- 
tions themselves, nothing 
more need be said. The honey- 
mooners, having left ship and 
town on a Friday afternoon, 
came back one week from the 
following Monday* morning. 
The eight met joyously in 
Bachelors’ Hall ; the girls 
kissing each other and the 
men indiscriminately and en- 
thusiastically; the men coop- 
erating zestfully. 

Temple scarcely blushed at 
all, she was so engrossed in 
trying to find out whether or 

*WhiIe it took some time to re- 
compute the exact Ardrian calen- 
dar, Terran day names and Terran 
weeks were used from the first. 
The Omans manufactured watches, 
clocks, and chronometers which 
divided the Ardrian day into 
twenty-four Ardrian hours, with 
minutes and seconds as usual, 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



not anyone was noticing any 
change. No one seemed to no- 
tice anything out of the ordi- 
nary. So, finally, she asked. 

“Don’t any of you, really, 
see anything different?” 

The six others all howled at 
that, and Sandra, between gig- 
gles and snorts, said: “No, 
precious, it doesn’t show a bit. 
Did you really think it 
would?” 

Temple blushed furiously 
and Hilton came instantly to 
his bride’s rescue. “Chip-chop 
the comedy, gang. She and I 
aren’t human any more. We’re 
a good jump toward being 
Omans. I couldn’t make her 
believe it doesn’t show.” 

That stopped the levity, 
cold, but none of the six could 
really believe it. However, af- 
ter Hilton had coiled a twen- 
ty-penny spike into a perfect 
helix between his fingers, and 
especially after he and Tem- 
ple had each chewed up and 
swallowed a piece of uran- 
exite, there were no grounds 
left for doubt. 

“That settles it... it tears 
it,” Karns said then. “Start all 
over again, Jarve. We’ll lis- 
ten, this time.” 

Hilton told the long story 
again, and added: “I had to 
re-work a couple of cells of 
Temple’s brain, but now she 
can read and understand the 
records as well as I can. So I 
thought I’d take her place on 
Team One and let her boss 
the job on all the other teams. 
Okay?” 

“So you don’t want to let 

79 




the rest of us in on it.” 
Karns’s level stare was a far 
cry from the way he had 
looked at his chief a moment 
before. ‘‘If there’s any one 
thing in the universe I never 
had you figured for, it’s a dog 
in the manger.” 

“Huh? You mean you ac- 
tually want to be a. .a. .hell, 
we don’t even know what we 
are !” 

“I do want it, Jarvis. We all 
do.” This was, of all people, 
Teddy! “No one in all history 
has had more than about fifty 
years of really productive 
thinking. And just the idea of 
having enough time. 

“Hold it, Teddy. Use your 
brain. The Masters couldn’t 
take it — they committed sui- 
cide. How do you figure we 
can do any better?” 

“Because we’ll use our 
brains!” she snapped. “They 
didn’t. The Omans will serve 
us; and that’s all they’ll do.’^ 
“And do you think you’ll be 
able to raise your children and 
grandchildren and so on to do 
the same? To have guts 
enough to resist the pull of 
such an ungodly habit-form- 
ing drug as this Oman service 
is?” 

sure of it.” She nod- 
•^ded positively. “And we’ll 
run all applicants through a 
fine enough screen to — that is, 
if we ever consider anybody 
except our own BuSci people. 
And there’s another reason.’^ 
She grinned, got up, wriggled 
out of her coverall, and posed 

80 



in bra and panties. “Look. I 
can keep most of this for five 
years. Quite a lot of it for ten. 
Then comes the struggle. 
What do you think I’d do for 
the ability, whenever it begins 
to get wrinkly or flabby, to 
peel the whole thing off and 
put on a brand-spanking-new 
smooth one? You name it. I’ll 
do it! Besides, Bill and I will 
both just simply and cold- 
bloodedly murder you if you 
try to keep us out.” 

“Okay.” Hilton locked at 
Temple; she looked at him; 
both looked at all the ethers. 
There was no revulsion at all. 
Nothing but eagerness. 

Temple took over. 

“I’m surprised. We’re both 
surprised. You see, Jarve 
didrx’t want to do it at all, but 
he had to. I not only didn’t 
want to, I was scared green 
and yellow at just the idea of 
it. But I had to, too, of course. 
We didn’t think anybody 
would really want to. We 
thought we’d be left here 
alone. We still will be, I 
think, when you’ve thought it 
clear through, Teddy. You 
just haven’t realized yet that 
we aren’t even human any 
more. We’re simply noth- 
ing but monsters!** Temple’s 
voice became a wail. 

“I’ve said my piece,” Teddy 
said. “You tell ’em. Bill.” 

“Let me say something 
first,” Kincaid said. “Temple, 
I’m ashamed of you. This line 
isn’t at all your usual straight 
thinking. What you actually 
are is homo superior. Bill?”

can add one Mt to that. I 
don't wonder that you were 
scared silly, ^Temple. Utterly 
new concept; and you went 
into it stone cold. But now 
we see the finished product 
and we like it. In fact, we 
drool." 

“I'll say we*re drooling” 
Sandra said. could do hand- 
stands and pinwheels with 

joy." 

“Let’s see you ” Hilton said. 
“That we’d all get a kick out 
of." 

“N ot ^ now — don’t want to 
hold this up— but sometime I 
just will. Bev?” 

‘T’m for it— and howl And 
won’t Bernadine be amazed," 
Beverly laughed gleefully, “at 
her wise-crack about the ‘race 
to end all human races’ com- 
ing true?" 

“I’m in favor of it, too, one 
hundred per centf* Poynter 
said. “Has it occurred to you, 
Jarve, that this opens up in- 
tergalactic exploration? No 
supplies to carry and plenty 
of time and fuel?" 

“No, it hadn’t. You’ve got a 
point there, Frank. That 
might take a little of the 
curse off of it, at that." 

“When some of our kids get 
to be twenty years old or so 
and get married, I’m going to 
take a crew of them to Andro- 
meda. We’ll arrange, then, to 
extend our honeymoons an- 
other week," Hilton said. 
“What will our policy be? 
Keep it dark for a while with 
just us eight, or spread it to 
the rest?" 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



“Spread it, I’d say," Kincaid 
said. 

“We can’t keep it secret, 
a n y w a y," Teddy argued. 
“Since Larry and Tuly were 
in on the whole deal, every 
Oman on the planet knows all 
about it. Somebody is going 
to ask questions, and Omans 
always answer questions and 
always tell the truth." 

^^^UESTIONS have al- 
ready been asked and 
ans^red," Larry said, going 
to the door and opening it. 

Stella rushed in. “We’ve 
been hearing the damnedest 
things!" She kissed every- 
body, ending with Hilton, 
whom she seized by both 
shoulders. “Is it actually true, 
boss, that you can fix me up 
so I’ll live practically forever 
and can eat more than eleven 
calories a day without getting 
fat as a pig? Candy, ice cream, 
cake, pie, eclairs, cream puffs, 
French pastries, sugar and 
gobs of thick cream in my cof- 
fee...?" 

Half a dozen others, includ- 
ing the van der Moen twins, 
came in. Beverly emitted 
a shriek of joy. “Bernadine! 
The mother of the race to end 
all human races!" 

“You whistled it, birdie!" 
Bernadine caroled. “I’m going 
to have ten or twelve, each 
one weirder than all the oth- 
ers. I told you I was a prophet 
—I’m going to hang out my 
shingle. Wholesale and retain 
prophecy; special rates for 
large parties." Her voice was 

81 




drowned out in a general 
elamon 

‘^Hold it, everybody !"’ Hil- 
ton yelled. ‘‘Chip-chop it! 
Quit it!” Then, as the noise 
subsided, “If you think I’m 
going to tell this tall tale over 
and over again for the next 
two weeks you’re all crazy. So 
shut down the plant and get 
everybody out here.” 

“Not everybody, J a r v e !” 
Temple snapped. “We don’t 
want scum, and there’s some 
of that, even in BuSci.” 

“You’re so right. Who, 
then?” 

“The rest of the heads and 
assistants, of course... and all 
the lab girls and their hus- 
bands and boy-friends. I know 
they are all okay. That will be 
enough for now, don’t you 
think?” 

“I do think;” and the indi- 
cated others were sent for; 
and in a few minutes arrived. 

The Omans brought chairs 
and Hilton stood on a table. 
He spoke for ten minutes. 
Then: “Before you decide 

whether you want to or not, 
think it over very carefully, 
because it’s a one-way street. 
Fluorine can not be displaced. 
Once in, you’re stuck for life. 
There is no way back, I’ve 
told you all the drawbacks and 
disadvantages I know of, but 
there may be a lot more that 

1 haven’t thought of yet. So 
think it over for a few days 
and when each of you has def- 
initely made up his or her 
mind, let me know.” He 
jumped down off the table. 

02 by 



H IS listeners, however, did 
not need days, or even 
seconds, to decide. Before 
Hilton’s feet hit the floor 
there was a yell of unanimous 
approval. 

He looked at his wife. “Do 
you suppose we're nuts?” 
“Uh-uh. Not a bit. Alex was 
right. I’m going to just love 
it!” She hugged his elbow 
ecstatically. “So are you, dar- 
ling, as soon as you stop look- 
ing at only the black side.” 
“You know... you could be 
right?” For the first time 
since the “ghastly” transfor- 
mation Hilton saw that there 
really was a bright side and 
began to study it. “With most 
of BuSci — and part of the 
Navy, and selectees from Ter- 
ra — it will be slightly terrific, 
at that!” 

“And that ‘habit-forming- 
drug’ objection isn’t insuper- 
able, darling,” Temple said. 
“If the younger generations 
start weakening we’ll fix the 
Omans. I wouldn’t want to 
wipe them out entirely, 
but...” 

“But how do we settle pri- 
ority, Doctor Hilton?” a girl 
called out ; a tall, striking, 
brunette laboratory technician 
whose name Hilton needed a 
second to recall. “By pulling 
straws or hair? Or by shoot- 
ing dice or each other or 
what?” 

“Thanks, Betty, you’ve got 
a point. Sandy Cummings and 
department heads first, then 
assistants. Then you girls, in 
alphabetical order, each with 



Edward E. Smith & E« Everett Evans 




her own husband or fiance.” 

•‘And my name is Ames. 
Oh, goody 

“L a r r y, please tell them 
to. 

“I already have, sir. We 
are set up to handle four at 
once.” 

“Good boy. So scat, all of 
you, and get back to work — 
except Sandy, Bill, Alex, and 
Teddy. You four go with 
Larry.” 

Since the new sense was not 
peyondix, Hilton had started 
calling it “perception” and 
the others adopted the term 
as a matter of course. Hilton 
could use that sense for what 
seemed like years — and actu- 
ally was whole minutes — 
at a time without fatigue or 
strain. He could not, how- 
ever, nor could the Omans, 
give his tremendous power to 
anyone else. 

As he had said, he could do 
a certain amount of rework- 
ing; but the amount of im- 
provement possible to make 
depended entirely upon what 
there was to work on. Thus, 
Temple could cover about 
six hundred light-years. It de- 
veloped later that the others 
of the Big Eight could cover 
from one hundred up to four 
hundred or so. The other de- 
partment heads and assistants 
turned out to be still weaker, 
and not one of the rank and 
file ever became able to cover 
more than a single planet. 

This sense was not exactly 
telepathy ; at least not what 
Hilton had always thought 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



telepathy would be. If any- 
thing, however, it was more. 
It was a lumping together of 
all five known human senses — 
and half a dozen unknown 
ones called, collectively, “in- 
tuition” — into one super-sense 
that was all-inclusive and all- 
informative. If he ever could 
learn exactly what it was and 
exactly what it did and how it 
did it... but he’d better chip- 
chop the wool-gathering and 
get back onto the job. 

T he Stretts had licked the 
old Masters very easily, 
and intended to wipe out the 
Omans and the humans. They 
had no doubt at all as to their 
ability to do it. Maybe they 
could. If the Masters hadn’t 
made some progress that the 
Omans didn’t know about, 
they probably could. That was 
the first thing to find out. As 
soon as they’d been converted 
he’d call in all the experts 
and they’d go through the 
Masters’ records like a dose 
of salts through a hillbilly 
schoolma’am. 

At that point in Hilton’s 
cogitations Sawtelle came in. 

He had come down in his 
gig, to confer with Hilton as 
to the newly beefed-up fleet. 
Instead of being glum and 
pessimistic and foreboding, he 
was chipper and enthusiastic. 
They had rebuilt a thousand 
Oman ships. By combining 
Oman and Terran science, and 
adding everything the First 
Team had been able to reduce 
to practise, they had hyped up 

83 




the power by a good fifteen 
per cent. Seven hundred of 
those ships, and all his men, 
were now arrayed in defense 
around Ardry. Three hundred, 
manned by Omans, were 
around Fuel Bin. 

‘Why?’' Hilton asked. “It’s 
Fuel Bin they’ve been attack- 
ing.” 

“Uh-uh. Minor objective,” 
the captain demurred, posi- 
tively. “The real attack v/ill 
be here at you; the headquar- 
ters and the brains. Then 
Fuel Bin will be duck soup. 
But the thing that pleased me 
most is the control. Man, you 
never imagined such control! 
No admiral in history ever 
had such control of ten ships 
as I have of seven hundred. 
Those Omans spread orders 
so fast that I don’t even finish 
thinking one and it’s being 
executed. And no misunder- 
standings, no slips. For in- 
stance, this last batch — fifteen 
skeletons. Far out; they’re 
getting cagy. I just thought 
‘Box ’em in and slug ’em’ and 
— In! Across! Out! Socko! 
Pffft! Just like that and just 
that fast. None of ’em had 
time to light a beam. Nobody 
before ever even dreamed of 
such control!” 

“That’s great, and I like it 
...and you’re only a captain. 
How many ships can Five- Jet 
Admiral Gordon put into 
space?” 

“That depends on what you 
call ships. Superdreadnoughts, 
Perseus class, six. First-line 
battleships, twenty-nine. Sec- 
84 



ond-line, smaller and some 
pretty old, seventy-three. 
Counting everything armed 
that will hold air, something 
over two hundred.” 

“I thought it was something 
like that. How would you like 
to be Five- Jet Admiral Saw- 
telle of the Ardrian Navy?” 
“I wouldn’t. I’m Terran 
Navy. But you knew that and 
you know me. So— what’s on 
your mind?” 

H ilton told him. / aught 
to put this on a tape, he 
thought to himself, and broad- 
cast it every hour on the hour, 
“They took the old Masters 
like dynamiting fish in a bar- 
rel,” he concluded, “and I’m 
damned afraid they’re going 
to lick us unless we take a 
lot of big, fast steps. But the 
hell of it is that I can’t tell 
you anything — ^not one single 
thing — about any part of it. 
There’s simply no way at all 
of getting through to you 
without making you over into 
the same kind of a thing I 
am.” 

“Is that bad?” Sawtelle was 
used to making important de- 
cisions fast. “Let’s get at it.” 
“Huh? Skipper, do you real- 
ize just what that means? If 
you think they’ll let you re- 
sign, forget it. They’ll cruci- 
fy you — ^brand you as a traitor 
and God only knows what 
else.” 

“Right. How about you and 
your people?” 

“Well, as civilians, it won’t 
be as bad ...” 



by Edward Smith & E. Everett Evans 




“The hell it won’t. Every 
man and woman that stays 
here will be posted forever as 
the blackest traitors old Ter- 
ra ever disgraced herself by 
spawning.” 

“You’ve got a point there, at 
that. We’ll all have to bring 
our relatives — the ones we 
think much of, at least— out 
here with us” 

“Definitely. New see what 
you can do about getting me 
run through your mill.” 

By exerting his authority, 
Kilton got S a w t e 1 1 e put 
through the “Preservatory” in 
the second batch processed. 
Then, linking minds with the 
captain, he flashed their joint 
attention to the Hall of Rec- 
ords. Into the right room ; into 
the right chest; along miles 
and miles of braided wire car- 
rying some of the prof oundest 
military secrets of the ancient 
Masters. 

Then : 

“Now you know a little of 
it,” Hilton said. “Maybe a 
thousandth of what we’ll have 
to have before we can take 
the Stretts as they will have 
to be taken.” 

For seconds Sawtelle could 

not speak. Then: “My 

God. I see what you mean. 
You’re right. No Omans can 
ever go to Terra; and no Ter- 
rans can ever come here ex- 
cept to stay forever.” 

The two then went out into 
space, to the flagship — ^which 
had been christened the Orion 
— and called in the six com- 
manders. 



“What is all this senseless 
idiocy we’ve been getting, 
Jarve?” Elliott demanded. 

Hilton eyed all six with pre- 
tended disfavor. “You six 
guys are the hardest-headed 
bunch of skeptics that 
ever went unhung,” he re- 
marked, dispassionately. “So 
it wouldn’t do any good to 
tell you anything — yet. The 
skipper and I will show you a 
thing first. Take her away. 
Skip.” 

The Orion shot av/ay under 
interplanetary drive and for 
several hours Hilton and Saw- 
telle worked at re-wiring and 
practically rebuilding two de- 
vices that no one, Oman or 
human, had touched since the 
Perseus had landed on Ardry. 

“What are you... I don’t 
understand what you are do- 
ing, sir,” Larry said. For the 
first time since Hilton had 
known him, the Oman’s mind 
was confused and unsure. 

“I know you don’t. This is 
a bit of top-secret Masters’ 
stuff. Maybe, some day, we’ll 
be able to re-work your brain 
to take it. But it won’t be for 
some time.” 

XII 

T he Orion hung in space, 
a couple of thousands of 
miles away from an asteroid 
which was perhaps a mile in 
average diameter. Hilton 
straightened up. 

“Put Triple X Black filters 
on your plates and watch that 
asteroid.” The commanders 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



85 




did so. "Ready?'’ he asked. 

"Ready, sir.” 

Hilton didn't move a mus- 
cle. Nothing actually moved. 
Nevertheless there was a mo- 
tionlessly writhing and crawl- 
ing distortion of the ship and 
everything in it, accompanied 
by a sensation that simply can 
not be described. 

It was not like going into 
or emerging from the sub- 
ether. It was not even remote- 
ly like space-sickness or sea- 
sickness or free fall or any- 
thing else that any Terran had 
ever before experienced. 

And the asteroid vanished. 

It disappeared into an out- 
rageously incandescent, furi- 
ously pyrotechnic, raveningly 
expanding atomic fireball that 
in seconds seemed to fill half 
of space. 

After ages-long minutes of 
the most horrifyingly devas- 
tating fury any man there had 
ever seen, the frightful thing 
expired and Hilton said: 
**That was just a kind of a 
firecracker. Just a feeble imi- 
tation of the first-stage deto- 
nator for what we'll have to 
have to crack the Stretts' 
ground-based screens. If the 
skipper and I had taken time 
to take the ship down to the 
shops and really work it over 
we could have put on a show. 
Was this enough so you iron- 
heads are ready to listen with 
your ears open and your 
mouths shut?" 

They were. So much so that 
not even Elliott opened his 
mouth to say yes. They mere- 
86 



ly nodded. Then again — for 
the last time, he hoped ! — 
Hilton spoke his piece. The 
response was prompt and 
vigorous. Only Sam Bryant, 
one of Hilton's staunchest al- 
lies, showed any uncertainty 
at all. 

"I've been married only a 
year and a half, and the baby 
was due about a month ago. 
How sure arc you that you 
can make old Gordon sit still 
for us skimming the cream off 
of Terra to bring out here?" 

"Doris Bryant, the cream of 
Terra!" Elliott gibed. "How 
modest our Samuel has be- 
come !" 

"Well, damn it, she is!'’ 
Bryant insisted. 

"Okay, she is," Hilton 
agreed. "But either we get our 
people or Terra doesn’t get 
its uranexite. That'll work. In 
the remote contingency that 
it doesn’t, there are still tight- 
er screws we can put on. But 
you missed the main snapper, 
Sam. Suppose Doris doesn't 
want to live for five thousand 
years and is allergic to be- 
coming a monster?" 

"Huh; you don't need to 
V o r r y about that." Sam 
’)rushed that argument aside 
with a wave of his hand. 
"Show me a girl who doesn't 
want to stay young and beau- 
tiful forever and I'll square 
you the circle. Come on. 
What's holding us up?" 

T he Orion hurtled through 
space back toward Ardry 
and Hilton, struck by a sud-

den thought, turned to the 
captain. 

“Skipper, why wouldn’t it 
be a smart idea to clamp a 
blockade onto Fuel Bin? Cut 
the Stretts’ fuel supply?” 

“I thought better of you 
than that, s o n.” Sawtelle 
shook his head sadly. “That 
was the first thing I did.” 

“Ouch. Maybe you’re ’way 
ahead of me too, then, on the 
one that we should move to 
Fuel Bin, lock, stock and bar- 
rel?” 

“Never thought of it, no. 
Maybe you’re worth saving, 
after all. After conversion, of 
course... Yes, there’d be 
three big advantages.” 

“Four.” 

Sawtelle raised his eye- 
brows. 

“One, only one planet to de- 
fend. Two, it’s self-defending 
against sneak landings. Noth- 
ing remotely human can land 
on it except in heavy lead ar- 
mor, and even in that can stay 
healthy for only a few min- 
utes.” 

“Except in the city. Omlu. 
That’s the weak point and 
would be the point of attack.” 

“Uh-uh. Cut off the decon- 
taminators and in five hours 
it’ll be as hot as the rest of 
the planet. Three, there’d be 
no interstellar supply line for 
the Stretts to cut. Four, the 
environment matches our new 
physiques a lot better than 
any normal planet could.” 

“That’s the one I didn’t 
think about.” 

“I think I’ll take a quick 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



peek at the Stretts — oh-oh ; 
they’ve screened their whole 
planet. Well, we can do that, 
too, of course.” 

“How are you going to se- 
lect and reject personnel? It 
looks as though everybody 
wants to stay. Even the men 
whose main object in life is 
to go aground and get drunk. 
The Omans do altogether too 
good a job on them and there’s 
no such thing as a hangover. 
I’m glad I’m not in your 
boots.” 

“You may be in it up to the 
eyeballs. Skipper, so don’t 
chortle too soon.” 

Hilton had already devoted 
much time to the problems of 
selection; and he thought of 
little else all the way back to 
Ardry. And for several days 
afterward he held conferences 
with small groups and con- 
ducted certain investigations. 

DUD Carroll of Sociology 
-■-^and his assistant Sylvia 
Banister had been married for 
weeks. Hilton called them, to- 
gether with Sawtelle and Bry- 
ant of Navy, into conference 
with the Big Eight. 

“The more I study this 
thing the less I like it,” Hil- 
ton said. “With a civilization 
having no government, no po- 
lice, no laws, no medium of 
exchange. .” 

“No money?** Bryant ex- 
claimed. “How’s old Gordon 
going to pay for his uranex- 
ite, then?” 

“He gets it free,” Hilton 
replied, flatly. “When anyone 

87 




can have anything he wants, 
merely by wanting it, what 
good is money? Now, remem- 
bering how long we’re e:oing 
to have to live, what we’ll be 
up against, that the Masters 
failed, and so on, it is clear 
that the prime basic we have 
to select for is stability. We 
twelve have, by psychodynam- 
ic measurement, the highest 
stability ratings available.” 
"‘Are you sure I belong 
here?” Bryant asked. 

“Yes. Here are three lists.” 
Hilton passed papers around. 
“The list labeled ‘OK’ names 
those I’m sure of — the ones 
we’re converting now and 
their wives and whatever on 
Terra. List ‘NG’ names the 
ones I know we don’t want. 
List ‘X’ — over thirty percent 
— are in-betweeners. We have 
to make a decision on the ‘X’ 
list. So— what I want to know 
is, who’s going to play God. 
I'm not. Sandy, are you?” 
“Good Heavens, no!” San- 
dra shuddered. “B u t I’m 
afraid I know who will have 
to. I’m sorry, Alex, but it’ll 
have to be you four — Psychol- 
ogy and Sociology.” 

Six heads nodded and there 
was a flashing interchange of 
thought among the four. Tem- 
ple licked her lips and nod- 
ded, and Kincaid spoke. 

“Yes, I’m afraid it’s our 
baby. By leaning very heavily 
on Temple, we can do it. Re- 
member, Jarve, what you said 
about the irresistible force? 
We’ll need it.” 

“As I said once before, Mrs. 
88 



Hilton, I’m very glad you’re 
along,” Hilton said. “But just 
how sure are you that even 
you can stand up under the 
load?” 

“Alone, I couldn’t. But 
don’t underestimate Mrs. Car- 
roll and the Messrs. Together, 
and with such a goal, I’m sure 
we can.” 

T hus, after four-fifths of 
his ov/n group and forty- 
one Navy men had been con- 
verted, Hilton called an eve- 
ning meeting of all the con- 
verts. Larry, Tuly and Jawy 
were the only Omans present. 

“You all knew, of course, 
that we were going to move 
to Fuel Bin sometime,” Hil- 
ton began. “I can tell you 
now that we who are here are 
all there are going to be of 
us. We are all leaving for Fuel 
Bin immediately after this 
meeting. Everything of any 
importance, including all of 
your personal effects, has al- 
ready been moved. All Omans 
except these three, and all 
Oman ships except the Orion, 
have already gone.” 

He paused to let the news 
sink in. 

Thoughts flew everywhere. 
The irrepressible Stella Wing 
— now Mrs. Osbert F. Hark- 
ins — ^was the first to give 
tongue. “What a wonderful 
job! Why, everybody’s here 
that I really like at all!” 

That sentiment was, of 
course, unanimous. It could 
not have been otherwise. Bet- 
ty, the ex- Ames, called out:

“How did you get their fe- 
male Omans away from Cecil 
Calthorpe and the rest of that 
chasing, booze-fighting bunch 
without them blowing the 
whole show?” 

“Some suasion was neces- 
sary,” Hilton admitted, with 
a grin. “Everyone who isn’t 
here is time-locked into the 
Perseus, Release time eight 
hours tomorrow,” 

“And they’ll wake up to- 
morrow morning with no 
Omans?” Bernadine tossed 
back her silvery mane and 
laughed. “Nor anything else 
except the Perseus? In a way, 
I’m sorry, but. .maybe I’ve 
got too much stinker blood in 
me, but I’m very glad none 
of them are here. But I’d like 
to ask, Jarvis — or rather, I 
suppose you have already set 
up a new Advisory Board?” 
“We have, yes.” Hilton read 
off twelve names. 

“Oh, nice. I don’t know of 
any people I’d rather have on 
it. But what I want to gripe 
about is calling our new home 
world such a horrible name as 
‘Fuel Bin,’ as though it were 
a wood-box or a coal-scuttle 
or something. And just think 
of the complexes it would set 
up in those super-children 
we’re going to have so many 
of.” 

“What would you suggest?” 
Hilton asked. 

“‘Ardvor’, of course,” Her- 
mione said, before her sister 
could answer. “We’ve had 
‘Arth’ and ‘Ardu’ and ‘Ardry’ 



and you — or somebody — start- 
ed calling us ‘Ardans’ to dis- 
tinguish us converts from the 
Terrans. So let’s keep up the 
same line.” 

There was general laughter 
at that, but the name was ap- 
proved. 

A bout midnight the meet- 
ing ended and the Orion 
set out for A r d v o r. It 
reached it and slanted sharply 
downward. The whole BuSci 
staff was in the lounge, watch- 
ing the big tri-di. 

“Hey! That isn’t Omlu!” 
Stella exclaimed. “It isn’t a 
city at all and it isn’t even 
in the same place!” 

“No, ma’am,” Larry said. 
“Most of you wanted the 
ocean, but many wanted a riv- 
er or the mountains. There- 
fore we razed Omlu and built 
your new city, Ardane, at a 
place where the ocean, two 
rivers, and a range of moun- 
tains meet. Strictly speaking, 
it is not a city, but a place of 
pleasant and rewardful liv- 
mg. 

The space-ship was coming 
in, low and fast, from the 
south. To the left, the west, 
there stretched the limitless 
expanse of ocean. To the 
right, mile after mile, were 
rough, rugged, jagged, partial- 
ly-timbered mountains, mass 
piled upon mass. Immediately 
below the speeding vessel was 
a wide, white-sand beach all 
of ten miles long. 

Slowing rapidly now, the

Orion flew along due north. 

“Look ! Look ! A natatori- 
um!” Beverly shrieked. “I 
know I wanted a nice big 
place to swim in, besides my 
backyard pool and the ocean, 
but I didn't tell anybody to 
build that — I swear I didn’t!*' 

“You didn’t have to, pet.” 
Poynter put his arm around 
her curvaceous waist and 
squeezed. “They knew. And I 
did a little thinking along that 
line myself. There’s our 
house, on top of the cliff over 
the natatorium — you can al- 
most dive into it off the 
patio.” 

“Oh, wonderful!” 

Immediately north of the 
natatorium a tremendous riv- 
er — named at first sight 
the “Whitewater” — rushed 
through its gorge into the 
ocean ; a river and gorge 
strangely reminiscent of the 
Colorado and its Grand Can- 
yon. On the south bank of 
that river, at its very mouth — 
looking straight up that tre- 
mendous canyon; on a rocky 
promontory commanding 
ocean and beach and moun- 
tains — there was a house. At 
the sight of it Temple hugged 
Hilton’s arm in ecstasy. 

“Yes, that’s ours,” he as- 
sured her. “Just about every- 
thing either of us has ever 
wanted.” The clamor was now 
so great — everyone was recog- 
nizing his-and-her house and 
was exclaiming about it — that 
both Temple and Hilton fell 
silent and simply watched the 
scenery unroll. 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



Across the turbulent White- 
water and a mile farther 
north, the mountains ended as 
abruptly as though they had 
been cut off with a cleaver 
and an apparently limitless ex- 
panse of treeless, grassy 
prairie began. And through 
that prairie, meandering slug- 
gishly to the ocean from the 
northeast, came the wide, deep 
River Placid. 

The Orion halted. It began 
to descend vertically, and only 
then did Hilton see the space- 
port. It was so vast, and there 
were so many spaceships on it, 
that from any great distance 
it was actually invisible ! Each 
six-acre bit of the whole im- 
mense expanse of lever prairie 
between the Placid and the 
mountains held an Oman su- 
perdreadnought ! 

T he staff paired off and 
headed for the airlocks. 
Hilton said : “Temple, have 
you any reservations at all, 
however slight, as to having 
Dark Lady as a permanent fix- 
ture in your home?” 

“Why, of course not — I 
like her as much as you do. 
And besides — ” she giggled 
like a schoolgirl — “even if she 
is a lot more beautiful than I 
am — I’ve got a few things she 
never will have... but there's 
something else. I got just a 
flash of it before you blocked. 
Spill it, please.” 

“You’ll see in a minute.” 
And she did. 

Larry, Dark Lady and Tem- 
ple’s Oman maid Moty were 

9^1: 




standing beside the Hilton’s 
car — and so was another 
Oman, like none ever before 
seen. Six feet four; shoulders 
that would just barely go 
through a door; muscled like 
Atlas and Hercules combined; 
skin a gleaming, satiny 
bronze; hair a rippling mass 
of lambent flame. Temple 
came to a full stop and caught 
her breath. 

''The Prince,” she breathed, 
in awe. ‘"Da Lormi’s Prince 
of Thebes. The ultimate 
bronze of all the ages. You 
did this, Jarve. How did you 
ever dig him up out of my 
schoolgirl crushes?” 

All six got into the car, 
which was equally at home on 
land or water or in the air. 
In less than a minute they 
were at Hilton House. 

The house itself was circu- 
lar. Its living-room was an im- 
mense annulus of glass from 
v/hich, by merely moving 
along its circular length, any 
desired view could be had. 
The pair walked around it 
once. Then she took him by 
the arm and steered him firm- 
ly toward one of the bedrooms 
in the center. 

‘"This house is just too 
much to take in all at once,” 
she declared. ""Besides, let’s 
put on our swimsuits and get 
over to the Nat.” 

In the room, she closed the 
door firmly in the faces of the 
Omans and grinned. ‘"Maybe, 
sometime. I’ll get used to hav- 
ing somebody besides you in 



my bedroom, but I haven’t, 
yet. Oh, do you itch, too?” 
Hilton had peeled to the 
waist and was scratching vig- 
orously all around his waist- 
line, under his belt. ""Like the 
very devil,” he admitted, and 
stared at her. For she, three- 
quarters stripped, was scratch- 
ing, too! 

""It started the minute we 
left the Orion,” he said, 
thoughtfully. ‘‘I see. These 
new skins of ours like hard 
radiation, but don’t like to be 
smothered while they’re en- 
joying it. By about tomorrow, 
we’ll be a nudist colony, I 
think.” 

‘"I could stand it, I suppose. 
What makes you think so?” 
""Just what I know about 
radiation. Frank would be the 
one to ask. My hunch is, 
though, that we’re going to be 
nudists whether we want to 
or not. Let’s go.” 

T hey went in a two-seater, 
leaving the Omans at home. 
Three-quarters of the staff 
were lolling on the sand or 
were seated on benches beside 
the immense pool. As they 
watched, Beverly ran out 
along the line of spring- 
boards; testing each one and 
selecting the stiffest. She then 
climbed up to the top plat- 
form — a good twelve feet 
above the board — and plum- 
meted down upon the board’s 
heavily padded take-off. Legs 
and back bending stubbornly 
to take the strain, she and the

board reached low-point to- 
gether, and, still in sync with 
it, she put every muscle she 
had into the effort to hurl 
herself upward. 

She had intended to go up 
thirty feet. But she had no 
idea whatever as to her pres- 
ent strength, or of what that 
Oman board, in perfect syn- 
chronization with that tre- 
mendous strength, would do. 
Thus, instead of thirty feet, 
she went up very nearly two 
hundred ; which of course 
spoiled completely her pro- 
posed graceful two-and-a-half. 

In midair she struggled 
madly to get into some ac- 
ceptable position. Failing, she 
curled up into a tight ball 
just before she struck water. 

What a splash! 

'Tt won’t hurt her — you 
couldn’t hurt her with a 
club!” Hilton snapped. He 
seized Temple’s hand as eve- 
ryone else rushed to the pool’s 
edge. ‘‘Look — Bernadine — 
that’s what I was thinking 
about.” 

Temple stopped and looked. 
The platinum-haired twins 
had been basking on the sand, 
and wherever sand had 
touched fabric, fabric had dis- 
appeared. 

Their suits had of course 
approached the minimum to 
start with. Now Bernadine 
wore only a wisp of nylon 
perched precariously on one 
breast and part of a ribbon 
that had once been a belt. Dis- 
covering the catastrophe, she 
shrieked once and leaped into 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



the pool any-which-way, cov- 
ering her breasts with her 
hands and hiding in water up 
to her neck. 

Meanwhile, the involuntari- 
ly high diver had come to the 
surface, laughing apologetical- 
ly. Surprised by the hair dan- 
gling down over her eyes, she 
felt for her cap. It was gone. 
So was her suit. Naked as a 
fish. She swam a couple of 
easy strokes, then stopped. 

“Frank! Oh, Frank!” she 
called. 

“Over here, Bev.” Her hus- 
band did not quite know 
whether to laugh or not. 

“Is it the radiation or the 
water? Or both?” 

“Radiation, I think. These 
new skins of ours don’t want 
to be covered up. But it prob- 
ably makes the water a pretty 
good imitation of a universal 
solvent.” 

“Good-by, clothes!” Beverly 
rolled over onto her back, 
fanned water carefully with 
her hands, and gazed approv- 
ingly at herself. “I don’t itch 
any more, anyway, so I’m very 
much in favor of it.** 

T hus the Ardans came to 
their new home world and 
to a life that was to be more 
comfortable by far and hap- 
pier by far than any of them 
had known on Earth. There 
were many other surprises 
that day, of course; of which 
only two will be mentioned 
here. When they finally left 
the pool, at about seventeen 



93 




hours G. M. T.*, everybody 
was ravenously hungry. 

‘‘But why should we be?” 
Stella demanded. “IVe been 
eating everything in sight, 
just for fun. But now I’m ac- 
tually hungry enough to eat a 
horse and wagon and chase 
the driver!” 

“Swimming makes every- 
body hungry,” Beverly said, 
“and I’m awfully glad that 
hasn’t changed. Why, I 
wouldn’t feel human if I 
didn’t!” 

Hilton and Temple went 
home, and had a long-drawn- 
out and very wonderful sup- 
per. Prince waited on Tem- 
ple, Dark Lady on Hilton; 
Larry and Moty ran the syn- 
thesizers in the kitchen. All 
four Omans radiated happi- 
ness. 

Another surprise came 
when they went to bed. For 
the bed was a raised platform 
of something that looked like 
concrete and, except for an 
uncanny property oi molding 
itself somewhat to the con- 
tours of their bodies, was al- 
most as hard as rock. Never- 
theless, it was the most com- 
fortable bed either of them 
had ever had. When they 
were ready to go to sleep, 
Temple said: 

“Drat it, those Omans still 
want to come in and sleep 



♦Greenwich Mean Time. Ardvor 
was, always and everywhere, full 
daylight. Terran time and calen- 
dar were adopted as a matter of 
course.

with us. In the room, I mean. 
And they suffer so. They’re 
simply radiating silent suf- 
fering and oh-so-submissive 
reproach. Shall we let ’em 
come in?” 

“That’s strictly up to you, 
sweetheart. It always has 
been.” 

“I know. I thought they’d 
quit it sometime, but I guess 
they never will. I still want 
an illusion of privacy at 
times, even though they know 
all about everything that 
goes on. But we might let ’em 
in now, just while we sleep, 
and throw ’em out again as 
soon as we wake up in the 
morning?” 

“You’re the boss.” Without 
additional invitation the four 
Omans came in and arranged 
themselves neatly on the 
floor, on all four sides of the 
bed. Temple had barely time 
to cuddle up against Hilton, 
and he to put his arm closely 
around her, before they both 
dropped into profound and 
dreamless sleep. 

A t eight hours next morn- 
ing all the specialists met 
at the new Hall of Records. 

This building, an exact du- 
plicate of the old one, was lo- 
cated on a mesa in the foot- 
hills southwest of the nata- 
torium, in a luxuriant grove 
at sight of which Kams 
stopped and began to laugh. 

“I thought I’d seen every- 
thing,” he remarked. “But 
yellow pine, spruce, tama- 
rack, apples, oaks, palms, or- 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




anges, cedars, Joshua trees 
and cactus — just to name a 
few — all growing on the same 
quarter-section of land?” 

“Just everything anybody 
wants, is all,” Hilton said. 
“But are they really grow- 
ing? Or just straight syn- 
thetics? Lane — Kathy — this 
is your dish.” 

“Not so fast, Jarve; give 
us a chance, please!** Kath- 
ryn, now Mrs. Lane Saunders, 
pleaded. She shook her spec- 
tacular head. “We don’t see 
how any stable indigenous 
life can have developed at all, 
unless. .” 

“Unless what ? Natural 
shielding?” Hilton asked, and 
Kathy eyed her husband. 

“R i g h t,” Saunders said. 
‘‘The earliest life-forms must 
have developed a shield be- 
fore they could evolve and 
stabilize. Hence, whatever it 
is that is in our skins was not 
a triumph of Masters’ sci- 
ence. They took it from Na- 
ture.” 

“Oh? Oh!’' These were two 
of Sandra’s most expressive 
monosyllables, followed by a 
third. “Oh. Could be, at that. 
But how could,., no, cancel 
that.” 

“You’d better cancel it, 
Sandy. Give us a couple of 
months, and maybe we can 
answer a few elementary 
questions.” 

Now inside the Hall, all 
the teams, from Astronomy to 
Zoology, went efficiently to 
work. Everyone now knew 
what to look for, how to find 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



it, and how to study it. 

“The First Team doesn’t 
need you now too much, does 
it, Jarve?” Sawtelle asked. 

“Not particularly. In fact, 
I was just going to get back 
onto my own job.” 

“Not yet. I want to talk to 
you,” and the two went into a 
long discussion of naval af- 
fairs. 

XIII 

T he Stretts’ fuel-supply 
line had been cut long 
since. Many Strett cargo- 
carriers had been destroyed. 
The enemy would of course 
have a very heavy reserve of 
fuel on hand. But there was 
no way of knowing how 
large it was, how many war- 
ships it could supply, or how 
long it would last. 

Two facts were, however, 
unquestionable. First, the 
Stretts were building a fleet 
that in their minds would be 
invincible. Second, they 
would attack Ardane as soon 
as that fleet could be made 
ready. The unanswerable 
question was : how long 

would that take? 

“So we want to get every 
ship we have. How many? 
Five thousand? Ten? Fif- 
teen? We want them convert- 
ed to maximum possible pow- 
er as soon as we possibly 
can,” Sawtelle said. “And I 
want to get out there with 
my boys to handle things.” 
“You aren’t going to. Nei- 
ther you nor your boys 
are expendable. Particularly 

95 




you.” Jaw hard-set, Hilton 
studied the situation for 
minutes. “No. What we’ll do 
is take your Oman, Kedy, 
We’ll re-set the Guide to 
drive into him everything 
you and the military Masters 
ever knew about arms, arma- 
ment, strategy, tactics and so 
on. And we’ll add everything 
I know of coordination, syn- 
thesis, and perception. That 
ought to make him at least 
a junior-grade military ge- 
nius.” 

“You can play that in 
spades. I wish you could do 
it to me.” 

“I can — if you’ll take 
the full Oman transforma- 
tion. Nothing else can stand 
the punishment.” 

“I know. No, I don’t want 
to be a genius that badly.” 

“Check. And we’ll take the 
resultcmt Kedy and make 
nine duplicates of him. Each 
one will learn from and prof- 
it by the mistakes made by 
preceding numbers and will 
assume command the instant 
his preceding number is 
killed.” 

“Oh, you expect, then. ?” 

“Expect? No. I know it 
damn well, and so do you. 
That’s why we Ardans will 
all stay aground. Why the 
Kedys’ first job will be to 
make the heavy stuff in and 
around Ardane as heavy as it 
can be made. Why it’ll all be 
on twenty-four-hour alert. 
Then they can put as 
many thousands of Omans as 
you please to work at ttiod- 

96 



ernizing all the Oman ships 
you want and doing any- 
thing else you say. Check?” 

Sawtelle thought for a 
couple of minutes. “A few 
details, is all. But that can be 
ironed out as we go along.” 

Both men worked then, al- 
most unremittingly for six 
solid days; at the end of 
which time both drew tre- 
mendous sighs of relief. 
They had done everything 
possible for them to do. The 
defense of Ardvor was now 
rolling at fullest speed to- 
ward its gigantic objective. 

Then captain and director, 
in two Oman ships with fifty 
men and a thousand Omans, 
leaped the world-girdling 
ocean to the mining opera- 
tion of the Stretts. There 
they found business strictly 
as usual. The strippers still 
stripped ; the mining mechs 
still roared and snarled their 
inchwise ways along their 
geometrically perfect ter- 
races; the little carriers still 
skittered busily between the 
varous miners and the stor- 
age silos. The fact that there 
was enough concentrate on 
hand to last a world for a 
hundred years made no dif- 
ference at all to these auto- 
matics; a crew of erector- 
mechs was building new silos 
as fast as existing ones were 
being filled. 

Since the men now under- 
stood everything that was go- 
ing on, it was a simple matter 
for them to stop the whole 
Strett operation in its tracks.

Then every man and every 
Oman leaped to his assigned 
job. Three days later, all the 
mechs went back to work. 
Now, however, they were 
working for the Ardans. 

The miners, instead of 
concentrate, now emitted 
vastly larger streams of 
Navy-Standard pelleted uran- 
exite. The carriers, instead 
of one-gallon cans, carried 
five-ton drums. The silos 
were immensely large r — 
thirty feet in diameter and 
towering two hundred feet 
into the air. The silos were 
not, hov/ever, being used as 
yet. One of the two Oman 
ships had been converted into 
a fuel-tanker and its yawning 
holds were being filled first. 

The Orion went back to 
Ardane and an eight-day wait 
began. For the first time in 
over seven months Hilton 
found time actually to loaf ; 
and he and Temple, lolling 
on the beach or hiking in the 
mountains, enjoyed them- 
selves and each other to the 
full 

All too soon, however, the 
heavily laden tanker ap- 
peared in the sky over Ar- 
dane. The Orion joined it; 
and the two ships slipped into 
sub-space for Earth. 

'^HREE days out, Hilton 
A used his sense of percep- 
tion to release the thought- 
controlled blocks that had 
been holding all the controls 
of the Perseus in neutral. He 
informed her officers — by re- 
M ASTERS OF SPACE 



leasing a public-address tape 
— ^that they were now free to 
return to Terra. 

Three days later, one day 
short of Sol, Sawtelle got 
Five- Jet Admiral Gordon’s 
office on the sub-space radio. 
An officious underling tried 
to block him, of course. 

'‘Shut up, Perkins, and lis- 
ten,” Sav/telle said, bruskly. 
“Tell Gordon I’m bringing in 
one hundred twenty thousand 
two hundred forty-five met- 
ric tons of pelleted uranex- 
ite. And if he isn’t on this 
beam in sixty seconds he’ll 
never get a gram of it.” 

The admiral, outraged al- 
most to the point of apo- 
plexy, came in. “Sawtelle, re- 
port yourself for court-mar- 
tial at...” 

“Keep still, Gordon,” the 
captain snapped. In sheer as- 
tonishment old Five-Jets 
obeyed. “I am no longer Ter- 
ran Navy ; no longer subject 
to your orders. As a matter 
of cold fact, I am no longer 
human. For reasons which I 
will explain later to the full 
Advisory Board, some of the 
personnel of Project Theta 
Orionis underwent transfor- 
mation into a form of life 
able to live in an environment 
of radioactivity so intense as 
to kill any human being in 
ten seconds. Under certain 
conditions v/e will supply, 
free of charge, F. O. B. Terra 
or Luna, all the uranexite the 
Solar System can use. The 
conditions are these,” and he 
gave them. “Do you accept 



97 




these conditions or not?” 

‘‘I ... I would vote to accept 
them, Captain. But that 
weight! One hundred twenty 
thousand metric tons — in- 
credible! Are you sure of 
that figure?” 

“Definitely. And that is 
minimum. The error is plus, 
not minus.” 

“This crippling power- 
shortage would really be 
over?” For the first time 
since Sawtelle had known 
him, Gordon showed that he 
was not quite solid Navy 
brass. 

“It’s over. Definitely. For 
good.” 

“I’d not only agree ; I’d 
raise you a monument. While 
I can’t speak for the Board, 
I’m sure they’ll agree.” 

“So am I. In any event, 
your cooperation is all that’s 
required for this first load.” 
The chips had vanished from 
Sawtelle’s shoulders. “Where 
do you want it. Admiral? 
Aristarchus or White 
Sands?” 

“White Sands, please. 
While there may be some de- 
lay in releasing it to indus- 
try. 

“While they figure out 
how much they can tax it?” 
Sawtelle asked, sardonically. 

“Well, if they don’t tax it 
it’ll be the first thing in his- 
tory that isn’t. Have you any 
objections to releasing all this 
to the press?” 

“None at all. The harder 
they hit it and the wider they 
spread it, the better. Will you 
98 



have this beam switched to 
Astrogation, please ?” 

“Of course. And thanks, 
Captain. I’ll see you at White 
Sands.” 

Then, as the now positively 
glowing Gordon faded away, 
Sawtelle turned to his own 
staff. “Fenway — Snowden — 
take over. Better double- 
check micro-timing with As- 
tro. Put us into a twenty- 
four-hour orbit over White 
Sands and hold us there. We 
won’t go down. Let the load 
down on remote, wherever 
they want it.” 

T he arrival of the Ardvor- 
ian superdreadnought Or- 
ion and the UC-1 (Uranexite 
Carrier Number One) was 
one of the most sensational 
events old Earth had ever 
known. Air and space craft 
went clear out to Emergence 
Volume Ninety to meet them. 
By the time the UC~1 was 
coming in on its remote-con- 
trolled landing spiral the 
press of small ships was so 
great that all the police forces 
available were in a lather 
trying to control it. 

This was exactly what Hil- 
ton had wanted. It made pos- 
sible the completely unob- 
served launching of several 
dozen small craft from the 
Orion herself. 

One of these made a very 
high and very fast flight to 
Chicago. With all due for- 
mality and under the aegis of 
a perfectly authentic Regis- 
try Number it landed on

O'Hare Field. Eleven deeply 
tanned young men emerged 
from it and made their way 
to a taxi stand, where each 
engaged a separate vehicle. 

Sam Bryant stepped into 
his cab, gave the driver a 
number on Oakwood Avenue 
in Des Plaines, and settled 
back to scan. He was lucky. 
He would have gone any- 
where she was, of course, but 
the way things were, he could 
give her a little warning to 
soften the shock. She had 
taken the baby out for an air- 
ing down River Road, and 
was on her way back. By hav- 
ing the taxi kill ten minutes 
or so he could arrive just af- 
ter she did. Wherefore he 
stopped the cab at a public 
communications booth and 
dialed his home. 

‘‘Mrs. Bryant is not at 
home, but she will teturn at 
fifteen t h i r t y,” the instru- 
ment said, crisply. “Would 
you care to record a message 
for her?” 

He punched the RECORD 
button. “This is Sam, Dolly 
baby. I’m right behind you. 
Turn around, why don’t you, 
and tell your ever-lovin’ star- 
hoppin’ husband hello?” 

The taxi pulled up at the 
curb just as Doris closed the 
front door; and Sam, after 
handing the driver a five- 
dollar bill, ran up the walk. 

He waited just outside the 
door, key in hand, while she 
lowered the stroller handle, 
took off her hat and by long- 
established habit reached out 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



to flip the communicator’s 
switch. At the first word, 
however, she stiffened rigid- 
ly — froze solid. 

Smiling, he opened the 
door, walked in, and closed it 
behind him. Nothing short of 
a shotgun blast could have 
taken Doris Bryant’s atten- 
tion from that recorder then. 

“That simply is not so,” she 
told the instrument firmly, 
with both eyes resolutely 
shut. “They made him stay on 
the Perseus, He won’t be in 
for at least three days. This 
is some cretin’s idea of a 
joke.” 

“Not this time, Dolly hon- 
ey. It’s really me.” 

Her eyes popped open as 
she whirled. “SAM!” she 
shrieked, and hurled herself 
at him with all the pent-up 
ardor and longing of two 
hundred thirty-four meticu- 
lously counted, husbandless, 
loveless days. 

After an unknown length 
of time Sam tipped her face 
up by the chin, nodded at the 
stroller, and said, “How about 
introducing me to the little 
stranger?” 

"*What a mother I turned 
out to be! That was the first 
thing I was going to rave 
about, the very first thing I 
saw you! Samuel Jay the 
Fourth, seventy-six days old 
today.” And so on. 

Eventually, however, the 
proud young mother watched 
the slightly apprehensive 
young father carry their 
first-born upstairs; where to-

too, of course?” she asked. 
”Yes, all the close ones.” 
“Marvelous! How soon are 
we leaving?” 

A t six o’clock next morn- 
ing, two hundred thirty- 
five days after leaving Earth, 
Hilton and Sawtelle set out 
to make the Ardans’ official 
call upon Terra’s Advisory 
Board. Both were wearing 
prodigiously heavy lead ar- 
mor, the inside of which was 
furiously radioactive. They 
did not need it, of course. But 
it would make all Ardans 
monstrous in Terran eyes 
and would conceal the fact 
that any other Ardans were 
landing. 

Their gig was met at the 
spaceport ; not by a limou- 
sine, but by a five-ton truck, 
into which they were loaded 
one at a time by a hydraulic 
lift. Cameras clicked, report- 
ers scurried, and tri^i scan- 
ners whirred. One of those 
scanners, both men knew, 
was reporting directly and 
only to the Advisory Board 
— ^which, of course, never 
took anything either for 
granted or at its face value. 

Their first stop was at a 
truck-scale, where each visitor 
was weighed. Hilton tipped 
the beam at four thousand six 
hundred fifteen pounds ; 
Sawtelle, a smaller man, 
weighed in at four thousand 
one hundred ninety. Thence 
to the Radiation Laboratory, 
where it was ascertained and 
reported that the armor did 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



not leak — which was reason- 
able enough, since each was 
lined with Masters’ plastics. 

Then into lead-lined test- 
ing cells, where each opened 
his face-plate briefly to a 
sensing element. Whereupon 
the indicating needles of two 
meters in the main laboratory 
went enthusiastically through 
the full range of red and 
held unwaveringly against 
their stops. 

Both Ardans felt the wave 
of shocked, astonished, al- 
most unbelieving consterna- 
tion that swept through the 
observing scientists and, in 
slightly lesser measure (be- 
cause they knew less about 
radiation) through the Ad- 
visory Board itself in a big 
room halfway across town. 
And from the Radiation Lab- 
oratory they were taken, via 
truck and freight elevator, to 
the Office of the Command- 
ant, where the Board was sit- 
ting. 

The story, which had been 
sent in to the Board the day 
before on a scrambled beam, 
was one upon which the Ar- 
dans had labored for days. 
Many facts could be with- 
held. However, every man 
aboard the Perseus would 
agree on some things. Indeed, 
the Earthship's communica- 
tions officers had undoubted- 
ly radioed in already about 
longevity and perfect health 
and Oman service and many 
other matters. Hence all such 
things would have to be ad- 
mitted and countered. 



101 




Thus the report, while it 
was air-tight, perfectly logi- 
cal, perfectly consistent, and 
apparently complete, did not 
please the Board at all. It 
wasn't intended to. 

cannot and do not 
approve of such un- 
warranted favoritism," the 
Chairman of the Board said. 
“Longevity has always been 
man's prime goal. Every hu- 
man being has the inalienable 
right to 

"Flapdoodle !" Hilton snort- 
ed. "This is not being broad- 
cast and this room is proofed, 
so please climb down off your 
soapbox. You don't need to 
talk like a politician here. 
Didn't you read paragraph 
12-A-2, one of the many 
marked ‘Top Secret'?" 

"Of course. But we do not 
understand how purely men- 
tal qualities can possibly have 
any effect upon purely physi- 
cal transformations. Thus it 
does not seem reasonable that 
any except rigorously 
screened personnel would die 
in the process. That is, of 
course, unless you contem- 
plate deliberate, cold-blooded 
murder." 

That stopped Hilton in his 
tracks, for it was too close for 
comfort to the truth. But it 
did not hold the captain for 
an instant. He was used to 
death, in many of its grisliest 
forms. 

"There are a lot of things 
no Terran ever will under- 
stand," Sawtelle replied in- 
102 



stantly. "Reasonable, or not, 
that's exactly what will hap- 
pen. And, reasonable or not, 
it'll be suicide, not murder. 
There isn't a thing that either 
Hilton or I can do about it." 

Hilton broke the ensuing 
silence. "You can say with 
equal truth that every human 
being has the right to run a 
four-minute mile or to com- 
pose a great symphony. It 
isn't a matter of right at all, 
but of ability. In this case the 
mental qualities are even 
more necessary than the 
physical. You as a Board did 
a very fine job of selecting 
the BuSci personnel for Proj- 
ect Theta Orionis. Almost 
eighty per cent of them 
proved able to withstand the 
Ardan conversion. On the 
other hand, only a very small 
percentage of the Navy per- 
sonnel did so." 

"Your report said that the 
remaining personnel of the 
Project were not informed as 
to the death aspect of the 
transformation," Admiral 
Gordon said. "Why not?" 

"That should be self-ex- 
planatory," Hilton said, flat- 
ly. "They are still human and 
still Terrans. We did not and 
will not encroach upon either 
the duties or the privileges of 
Terra's Advisory Board. 
What you tell all Terrans, 
and how much, and how, must 
be decided by yourselves. 
This also applies, of course, 
to the other ‘Top Secret' 
paragraphs of the report, 
none of which are known to 



by Edward C. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




any Terran outside the 
Board/’ 

’’But you haven’t said any- 
thing about the method of se- 
lection,” another Advisor 
complained. “Why, that will 
take all the psychologists of 
the world, working full time; 
continuously.” 

“We said we would do the 
selecting. We meant just 
that,” Hilton said, coldly. 
“No one except the very few 
selectees will know anything 
about it. Even if it were an 
unmixed blessing — ^which it 
very definitely is not— do you 
want all humanity thrown 
into such an uproar as that 
would cause? Or the quite 
possible racial inferiority 
complex it might set up? To 
say nothing of the question 
of how much of Terra’s best 
blood do you want to drain 
off, irreversibly and perma- 
nently? No. What we suggest 
is that you paint the picture 
so black, using Sawtelle and 
me and what all humanity 
has just seen as horrible ex- 
amples, that nobody would 
take it as a gift. Make them 
shun it like the plague. Hell, 
I don’t have to tell you what 
your propaganda machines 
can do.” 

T he Chairman of the 
Board again mounted his 
invisible rostrum. “Do you 
mean to intimate that we are 
to falsify the record?” he de- 
claimed. “To try to make liars 
out of hundreds of eyewit- 
nesses? You ask us to distort 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



the truth, to connive at...” 
*^We aren’t asking you to 
do anythin gT . Hilton 
snapped. “We don’t give a 
damn what you do. Just study 
that record, with all that it 
implies. Read between the 
lines. As for those on the 
Perseus, no two of them will 
tell the same story and not 
one of them has even the re- 
motest idea of what the real 
story is. I, personally, not 
only did not want to become 
a monster, but would have 
given everything I had to 
stay human. My wife felt the 
same way. Neither of us 
would have converted if 
there’d been any other way 
in God’s universe of getting 
the uranexite and doing some 
other things that simply must 
be done.” 

“What other things?” Gor- 
don demanded. 

“You’ll never know,” Hil- 
ton answered, quietly. 
“Things no Terran ever will 
know. We hope. Things that 
would drive any Terran stark 
mad. Some of them are hinted 
at — as much as we dared — be- 
tween the lines of the re- 
port.” 

The report had not men- 
tioned the Stretts. Nor were 
they to be mentioned now. If 
the Ardans could stop them, 
no Terran need ever know 
anvthing abou^ them. 

If not, no Terran should 
know anything about them 
except what he would learn 
for himseii^ just before the 
end. For Terra would never 

103 




be able to do anything to de- 
fend herself against the 
Stretts. 

''Nothing whatever can 
drive me mad,” Gordon de- 
clared, "and I want to know 
all about it — right now!” 

"You can do one of two 
things, Gordon,” Sawtelle 
said in disgust. His sneer was 
plainly visible through the 
six-ply, plastic-backed lead 
glass of his face-plate. "Ei- 
ther shut up or accept my 
personal invitation to come to 
Ardvor and try to go through 
the wringer. That’s an invi- 
tation to your own funeral.” 
Five- Jet Admiral Gordon, 
tom inwardly to ribbons, 
made no reply. 

"I repeat,” Hilton went on, 
"we are not asking you to do 
anything whatever. We are 
offering to give you, free of 
charge but under certain con- 
ditions, all the power your 
humanity can possibly use. 
We set no limitation what- 
ever as to quantity and with 
no foreseeable limit as to 
time. The only point at issue 
is whether or not you accept 
the conditions. If you do not 
accept them we’ll leave now — 
and the offer will not be re- 
peated.” 

"And you would, I pre- 
sume, take the UC-1 back 
with you?” 

"Of course not, sir. Terra 
needs power too badly. You 
are perfectly welcome to that 
one load of uranexite, no 
matter what is decided here.” 

"That’s one way of putting 

104 



it,” Gordon sneered. "But the 
truth is that you know 
damned well I’ll blow both of 
your ships out of space if you 
so much as ... ” 

"Oh, chip-chop the jaw- 
flapping, Gordon!” Hilton 
snapped. Then, as the ad- 
miral began to bellow orders 
into his microphone, he went 
on: "You want it the hard 
way, eh? Watch what hap- 
pens, all of you!” 

T he UC-1 shot vertically 
into the air. Through its 
shallow dense layer and into 
and through the stratosphere. 
Earth’s fleet, already on full 
alert and poised to strike, 
rushed to the attack. But the 
carrier had reached the Orion 
and both Ardvorian ships had 
been waiting, motionless, for 
a good half minute before the 
Terran warships arrived and 
began to blast with every- 
thing they had. 

"Flashlights and firecrack- 
ers,” Sawtelle said, calmly. 
"You aren’t even warming up 
our screens. As soon as you 
quit making a damned fool of 
yourself by wasting energy 
that way, we’ll set the l/C-1 
back down where she was 
and get on with our business 
here.” 

"You will order a cease-fire 
at once. Admiral,” the chair- 
man said, "or the rest of us 
will, as of now, remove you 
from the Board.” Gordon 
gritted his teeth in rage, but 
gave the order. 

"If he hasn’t had enough 



by Edward E., Smith & E« Eyerett Evans 




yet to convince him,” Hilton 
suggested, ‘‘he might send up 
a drone. We don’t want to 
kill anybody, you know. One 
with the heaviest screening 
he’s got — just to see what 
happens to it.” 

“He’s had enough. The rest 
of us have had more than 
enough. That exhibition was 
not only uncalled-for and 
disgusting — it was outrage- 
ous !” 

The meeting settled down, 
then, from argument to con- 
structive discussion, and 
many to-pics were gone over. 
Certain matters were, how- 
ever, so self-evident that they 
were not even mentioned. 

Thus, it was a self-evident 
fact that no Terran could ever 
visit Ardvor; for the instru- 
ment-readings agreed with 
the report’s statements as to 
the violence of the Ardvorian 
environment, and no Terran 
could possibly walk around in 
two tons of lead. Conversely, 
it was self-apparent to the 
Terrans that no Ardan could 
ever visit Earth without be- 
ing recognized instantly for 
what he was. Wearing such 
armor made its necessity 
starkly plain. No one from 
the Perseus could say that 
any Ardan, after having lived 
on the furiously radiant sur- 
face of Ardvor, would not be 
as furiously radioactive as 
the laboratory’s calibrated in- 
struments had shown Hilton 
and Sawtelle actually to be. 

Wherefore the conference 
went on, quietly and cooper- 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



atively, to its planned end. 

One minute after the Ter- 
ran battleship Perseus 
emerged into normal space, 
the Orion went into sub- 
space for her long trip back 
to Ardvor. 

T he last two days of that 
s e V e n-day trip were the 
longest-seeming that either 
Hilton or Sawtelle had ever 
known. The sub-space radio 
was on continuously and 
Kedy-One reported to Saw- 
telle every five minutes. 
Even though Hilton knew 
that the Oman commander- 
in-chief was exactly as good 
at perceiving as he himself 
was, he found himself scan- 
ning the thoroughly screened 
Strett world forty or fifty 
times an hour. 

However, in spite of worry 
and apprehension, time wore 
eventlessly on. The Orion 
emerged, went to Ardvor and 
landed on Ardane Field. 

Hilton, after greeting prop- 
erly and reporting to his 
wife, went to his office. 
There he found that Sandra 
had everything v/ell in hand 
except for a few tapes that 
only he could handle. Saw- 
telle and his officers went to 
the new Command Central, 
where everything was rolling 
smoothly and very much fast- 
er than Sawtelle had dared 
hope. 

The terran immigrants had 
to live in the Orion, of 
course, until conversion into 
Ardans. Almost equally of 

105 




course — since the Bryant in- 
fant was the only young baby 
in the lot — Doris and her 
Sammy Small were, by popu- 
lar acclaim, in the first batch 
to be converted. For little 
Sammy had taken the entire 
feminine contingent by 
storm. No Oman female had 
a chance to act as nurse as 
long as any of the girls were 
around. Which was practical- 
ly all the time. Especially 
the platinum-blonde twins; 
for several months, now, Ber- 
nadine Braden and Hermione 
Felger. 

“And you said they were so 
hard-boiled,” Doris said ac- 
cusingly to Sam, nodding at 
the twins. On hands and 
knees on the floor, head to 
head with Sammy Small be- 
tween them, they were growl- 
ing deep-throated at each 
other and nuzzling at the 
baby, who was having the 
time of his young life. “You 
couldn’t have been any 
wronger, my sweet, if you’d 
had the whole Octagon help- 
ing you go astray. They’re 
just as nice as they can be, 
both of them.” 

Sam shrugged and grinned. 
His wife strode purposefully 
across the room to the play- 
ful pair and lifted their pre- 
tended prey out from between 
them. 

“Quit it, you two,” she di- 
rected, swinging the baby up 
and depositing him a-straddle 
her left hip. “You’re just 
simply spoiling him rotten.” 

“You think so, Dolly? Uh- 
106 



uh, far be it from such.” Ber- 
nadine came lithely to her 
feet. She glanced at her own 
taut, trim abdomen; upon 
which a micrometrically-pre- 
cise topographical mapping 
job might have revealed an 
otherwise imperceptible bulge. 
“Just you wait until Junior 
arrives and I’ll show you 
how to really spoil a baby. 
Besides, what’s the hurry?” 
“He needs his supper. Vita- 
mins and minerals and hard 
radiations and things. And 
then he’s going to bed. I don’t 
approve of this no-sleep busi- 
ness. So run along, both of 
you, until tomorrow.” 

XIV 

A S has been said, the 
Stretts were working, 
with all the intensity of their 
monstrous but tremendously 
capable minds, upon their 
Great Plan; which was, basic- 
ally, to conquer and either 
enslave or destroy every oth- 
er intelligent race through- 
out all the length, breadth, 
and thickness of total space. 
To that end each individual 
Strett had to become invul- 
nerable and immortal. 

Wherefore, in the incon- 
ceivably remote past, there 
had been put into effect a 
program of selective breeding 
and of carefully-calculated 
treatments. It was mathemati- 
cally certain that this pro- 
gram would result in a race 
of beings of pure force — ^be- 
ings having no material con-

stituents remaining whatever. 

Under those hellish treats 
ments billions upon billions of 
Stretts had died. But the few 
remaining thousands had al- 
most reached their sublime 
goal. In a few more hundreds 
of thousands of years perfec- 
tion would be reached. The 
few surviving hundreds of 
perfect beings could and 
would multiply to any de- 
sired number in practically no 
time at all. 

Hilton and his seven fel- 
low-workers had perceived all 
this in their one and only 
study of the planet Strett, 
and every other Ardan had 
been completely informed. 

A dozen or so Strett Lords 
of Thought, male and female, 
were floating about in the at- 
mosphere — which was not air 
— of their Assembly Hall. 
Their heads were globes of 
ball lightning. Inside them 
could be seen quite plainly 
the intricate convolutions of 
immense, less-than-half-ma- 
terial brains, shot through 
and through with rods and 
pencils and shapes of pure, 
scintillating force. 

And the bodies! Or, rather, 
each horrendous brain had a 
few partially material ap- 
pendages and appurtenances 
recognizable as bodily^ or- 
gans. There were no mouths, 
no ears, no eyes, no noses or 
nostrils, no lungs, no legs or 
arms. There were, however, 
hearts. Some partially materi- 
al ichor flowed through those 
living-f ire -0 u 1 1 i n e d tubes. 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



There were starkly function- 
al organs of reproduction 
with which^ by no stretch of 
the imagination, could any 
thought of tenderness or of 
love be connected. 

It was a good thing for the 
race, Hilton had thought at 
first perception of the things, 
that the Stretts had bred out 
of themselves every iota of 
the finer, higher attributes of 
life. If they had not done so, 
the impotence of sheer disgust 
would have supervened so 
long since that the race would 
have been extinct for ages. 

“Thirty-eight periods ago 
the Great Brain was cliar^ed 
with the sum total of Strett- 
sian knowledge,” First Lord 
Thinker Zoyar radiated to the 
assembled Stretts. “For those 
thirty-eight periods it has 
been scanning, peyondiring, 
amassing data and formulat- 
ing hypotheses, theories, and 
conclusions. It has just in- 
formed me that it is now 
ready to make a preliminary 
report. Great Brain, how 
much of the total universe 
have you studied?” 

“This Galaxy only,” the 
Brain radiated, in a texture 
of thought as hard and as 
harsh as Zoyar's own. 

“Why not more?” 
“Insufficient power. My 
first conclusion is that who- 
ever set up the specifications 
for me is a fool.” 

T O say that the First Lord 
went out of control at this 
statement is to put it very 

107 




mildly indeed. He fulminat- 
ed, ending with : “ . de- 

stroyed instantly !” 

‘‘Destroy me if you like,” 
came the utterly calm, utter- 
ly cold reply. am in no 
sense alive. I have no con- 
sciousness of self nor any de- 
sire for continued existence. 
To do so, however, would. .” 

A flurry of activity inter- 
rupted the thought. Zoyar 
was in fact assembling the 
forces to destroy the brain. 
But, before he could act. 
Second Lord Thinker Ynos 
and another female blew him 
into a mixture of loose mole- 
cules and flaring energies. 

“Destruction of any and all 
irrational minds is manda- 
tory,” Ynos, now First Lord 
Thinker, explained to the 
linked minds. “Zoyar had 
been becoming less and less 
rational by the period. A good 
workman does not causeless- 
ly destroy his tools. Go 
ahead. Great Brain, with your 
findings.” 

“...not be logical.” The 
brain resumed the thought 
exactly where it had been 
broken off. “Zoyar erred in 
demanding unlimited per- 
formance, since infinite 
knowledge and infinite abil- 
ity require not only infinite 
capacity and infinite power, 
but also infinite time. Nor is 
it either necessary or desir- 
able that I should have such 
qualities. There is no reason- 
able basis for the assumption 
that you Stretts will conquer 
any significant number even 
108 



of the millions of intelligent 
races now inhabiting this one 
Galax3^” 

“Why not?” Ynos demand- 
ed, her thought almost, but 
not quite, as steady and cold 
as it had been. 

“The answer to that ques- 
tion is implicit in the second 
indefensible error made in my 
construction. The prime da- 
tum impressed into my banks, 
that the Stretts are in fact 
the strongest, ablest, most in- 
telligent race in the universe, 
proved to be false. I had to 
eliminate it before I could do 
any really constructive think- 
mg. 

A roar of condemnatory 
thought brought all circum- 
ambient ether to a boil. “Bah 
— destroy it !” “Detestable !” 
“Intolerable!” “If that is the 
best it can do, annihilate it!” 
“Far better brains have been 
destroyed for much less!” 
“Treason !” And so on. 

First Lord Thinker Ynos, 
however, remained relatively 
calm. “While we have always 
held it to be a fact that we 
are the highest race in exist- 
ence, no rigorous proof has 
been possible. Can you now 
disprove that assumption?” 

iiT have disproved it. I have 

A not had time to study all 
of the civilizations of this 
Galaxy, but, I have examined 
a statistically adequate sam- 
ple of one million seven hun- 
dred ninety-two thousand four 
hundred sixteen different 
planetary intelligences. I

found one which is consider- 
ably abler and more advanced 
than you Stretts. Therefore 
the probability is greater 
than point nine nine that 
there are not less than ten, 
and not more than two hun- 
dred eight, such races in this 
Galaxy alone/' 

"‘Impossible !" Another 
wave of incredulous and 
threatening anger swept 
through the linked minds; a 
wave which Ynos flattened 
out with some difficulty. 

Then she asked : “Is it 

probable that we will make 
contact with this supposedly 
superior race in the foresee- 
able future?” 

“You are in contact with it 
now.” 

“IV’h-at?” Even Ynos was 
contemptuous now. “You 
mean that one shipload of 
despicable humans who — far 
too late to do them any good 
— ^barred us temporarily from 
Fuel V/orld?” 

“Not exactly or only those 
humans, no. And your as- 
sumptions may or may not be 
valid.” 

“Don’t you know whether 
they are or not?” Ynos 
snapped. “Explain your un- 
certainty at once!” 

“I am uncertain because of 
insufficient data,” the brain 
replied, calmly. “The only 
pertinent facts of which I am 
certain are: First, the world 
Ardry, upon which the Omans 
formerly lived and to which 
the humans in question first 
went — a planet which no 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



Strett can peyondire— is now 
abandoned. Second, the 
Stretts of old did not com- 
pletely destroy the humanity 
of the world Ardu. Third, 
some escapees from Ardu 
reached and populated the 
world Ardry. Fourth, the an- 
droid Omans were developed 
on Ardry, by the human es- 
capees from Ardu and their 
descendants. Fifth, the 
Omans referred to those hu- 
mans as ‘Masters.’ Sixth, af- 
ter living on Ardry for a very 
long period of time the Mas- 
ters went elsewhere. Seventh, 
the Omans remaining on Ar- 
dry maintained, continuously 
and for a very long time, the 
status quo left by the Mas- 
ters. Eighth, immediately 
upon the arrival from Terra 
of these present humans, that 
long-existing status was bro- 
ken. Ninth, the planet called 
Fuel World is, for the first 
time, surrounded by a screen 
of force. The formula of this 
screen is as follows.” 

The brain gave it. No 
Strett either complained or 
interrupted. Each was too 
busy studying that formula 
and examining its stunning 
implications and connota- 
tions. 

“Tenth, that formula is one 
full order of magnitude be- 
yond anything previously 
known to your science. 
Eleventh, it could not have 
been developed by the sci- 
ence of Terra, nor by that of 
any other world whose popu- 
lation I have examined.” 



109 




T he brain took the linked 
minds instantaneously to 
Terra; then to a few thou- 
sand or so other worlds in- 
habited by human beings ; 
then to a few thousands of 
planets whose populations 
were near-human, non-human 
and monstrous. 

"Tt is therefore clear,'* it 
announced, “that this screen 
was computed and produced 
by the race, whatever it may 
be, that is now dwelling on 
Fuel World and asserting 
full ownership of it.** 

“Who or what is that 
race?” Ynos demanded. 

“Data insufficient.’* 
“Theorize, then!” 

“Postulate that the Mas- 
ters, in many thousands of 
cycles of study, made ad- 
vances in science that were 
not reduced to practice; that 
the Omans either possessed 
this knowledge or had access 
to it; and that Omans and 
humans cooperated fully in 
sharing and in working with 
all the knowledges thus avail- 
able. From these three postu- 
lates the conclusion can be 
drawn that there has come 
into existence a new race. 
One combining the best 
qualities of both humans and 
Omans, but with the weak- 
nesses of neither.” 

“An unpleasant thought, 
truly,” Ynos thought. “But 
you can now, I suppose, de- 
sign the generators and pro- 
jectors of a force superior to 
that screen.*’ 

“Data insufficient. I can 

^ ^ O by Edwi 



equal it, since both generation 
and projection are implicit in 
the formula. But the data so 
adduced are in themselves 
vastly ahead of anything pre- 
viously in my banks.” 

“Are there any other races 
in this Galaxy more powerful 
than the postulated one now 
living on Fuel World?” 
“Data insufficient.” 
“Theorize, then!” 

“Data insufficient.” 

The linked minds concen- 
trated upon the problem for 
a period of time th?t might 
have been either days or 
weeks. Then: 

“Great Brain, advise us,” 
Ynos said. “What is best for 
us to do?” 

“With identical defensive 
screens it becomes a question 
of relative power. You should 
increase the size and power 
of your warships to some- 
thing beyond the computed 
probable maximum of the 
enemy. You should build 
more ships and missiles than 
they will probably be able to 
build. Then and only then 
will you attack their war- 
ships, in tremendous force 
and continuously.” 

“But not their planetary 
defenses. I see.” Ynos’s 
thought was one of complete 
understanding. “And the real 
offensive will be?” 

“No mobile structure can 
be built to mount mechanisms 
of power sufficient to smash 
down by sheer force of out- 
put such tremendously pow- 
erful installations as their 

‘d E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




planet-based defenses must 
be assumed to be. Therefore 
the planet itself must be de- 
stroyed. This will require a 
missile of planetary mass. 
The best such missile is the 
tenth planet of their own 
sun.’* 

see.” Ynos’s mind was 

-I- leaping ahead, consider- 
ing hundreds of possibilities 
and making highly intricate 
and involved computations. 
‘'That will, however, require 
many cycles of time and more 
power than even our immense 
reserves can supply.” 

“True. It will take much 
time. The fuel problem, how- 
ever, is not a serious one, 
since Fuel World is not 
unique. Think on. First Lord 
Ynos.” 

“We will attack in maxi- 
mum force and with maxi- 
mum violence. We will blan- 
ket the planet. We will main- 
tain maximum force and vio- 
lence until most or all of the 
enemy ships have been de- 
stroyed. We will then install 
planetary drives on Ten and 
force it into collision orbit 
with Fuel World, meanwhile 
exerting extreme precautions 
that not so much as a spy- 
beam emerges above the ene- 
my's screen. Then, still main- 
taining extreme precaution, 
we will guard both planets 
until the last possible moment 
before the collision. Brain, it 
cannot fail!” 

“You err. It can fail. All 
we actually know of the abil- 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



ities of this postulated neo- 
human race is what I have 
learned from the composition 
of its defensive screen. The 
probability approaches unity 
that the Masters continued 
to delve and to learn for mil- 
lions of cycles while you 
Stretts, reasonlessly certain 
of your supremacy, concen- 
trated upon your evolution 
from the material to a non- 
material form of life and per- 
formed only limited research 
into armaments of greater 
and ever greater power.” 

“True. But that attitude 
was then justified. It was not 
and is not logical to assume 
that any race would establish 
a fixed status at any level of 
ability below its absolute 
maximum.” 

“While that conclusion 
could once have been defen- 
sible, it is now virtually cer- 
tain that the Masters had 
stores of knowledge which 
they may or may not have 
withheld from the Omans, 
but which were in some way 
made available to the neo- 
humans. Also, there is no 
basis whatever for the as- 
sumption that this new race 
has revealed all its potential- 
ities.” 

“Statistically, that is prob- 
ably true. But this is the best 
plan you have been able to 
formulate?” 

“It is. Of the many thou- 
sands of plans I set up and 
tested, this one has the high- 
est nrobability of success,” 

“Then we will adopt it. We

are Stretts. Whatever we de- 
cide upon will be driven 
through to complete success. 
We have one tremendous ad- 
vantage in you.” 

“Yes. The probability ap- 
proaches unity that I can per- 
form research on a vastly 
wider and larger scale, and 
almost infinitely faster, than 
can any living organism or 
any possible combination of 
such organisms.” 

N or v/as the Great Brain 
bragging. It scanned in 
moments the stored scientif- 
ic knowledge of over a mil- 
lion planets. It tabulated, 
correlated, analyzed, synthe- 
sized, theorized and conclud- 
ed — all in microseconds of 
time. Thus it made more prog- 
ress in one Terran week 
than the Masters had made 
in a million years. 

When it had gone as far as 
it could go, it reported its re- 
sults — and the Stretts, hard 
as they were and intransi- 
gent, were amazed and over- 
joyed. Not one of them had 
ever even imagined such ar- 
maments possible. Hence they 
became supremely confident 
that it was unmatched and 
unmatchable throughout all 
space. 

What the Great Brain did 
not know, however, and the 
Stretts did not realize, was 
that it could not really think. 

Unlike the human mind, it 
could not deduce valid theo- 
ries or conclusions from in- 
complete, insufficient, frag- 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



mentary data. It could not 
leap gaps. Thus there was no 
more actual assurance than 
before that they had exceed- 
ed, or even matched, the 
weaponry of the neo-humans 
of Fuel World. 

Supremely confident, Ynos 
said : “We will now discuss 
every detail of the plan in 
sub-detail, and will correlate 
every sub-detail with every 
other, to the end that every 
action, however minor, will 
be performed perfectly and 
in its exact time.” 

That discussion, which 
lasted for days, was held. 
Hundreds of thousands of 
new and highly specialized 
mechs were built and went 
furiously and continuously 
to work. A fuel-supply line 
was run to another uranexite- 
rich planet. 

Stripping machines 
stripped away the surface 
layers of soil, sand, rock and 
low-grade ore. Giant miners 
tore and dug and slashed and 
refined and concentrated. 
Storage silos by the hundreds 
were built and were filled. 
Hundreds upon hundreds of 
concentrate-carriers bored 
their stolid ways through hy- 
perspace. Many weeks of time 
passed. 

But of what importance are 
mere weeks of time to a race 
that has, for many millions 
of years, been adhering rigid- 
ly to a pre-set program? 

The sheer magnitude of the 
operation, and the extraordi-

break that cade; since it was 
keyed to the basic difference 
between the Strett mentality 
and the human. Thus, they 
left it deliberately for some 
human race to find. 

‘‘Finally, and most impor- 
tant, our physicists and the- 
oreticians are not able to ex- 
trapolate, from the analysis 
of our screen, to the concepts 
underlying the Masters’ ulti- 
mate v.eapons of offense, the 
first-stage booster and its fi- 
nal end-product, the Vang. If, 
as we can safely assume, the 
Stretts do not already have 
those weapons, they will know 
nothing about them until we 
ourselves use them in battle. 

“These are, of course, only 
the principal points covered. 
Does anyone wish to amend 
this summation as recorded?’' 

O one did. 

The meeting was ad- 
journed. Hilton, however, ac- 
companied Sawtelle and Kedy 
to the captain’s office. “So 
you see, Skipper, we got 
troubles,” he said. “If we 
don’t use those boosters 
against their skeletons it’ll 
boil down to a stalemate last- 
ing God only knows how long. 
It will be a war of attrition, 
outcome dependent on which 
side can build the most and 
biggest and strongest ships 
the fastest. On the other 
hand, if we do use ’em on de- 
fense here, they’ll analyze 
’em and have everything 
worked out in a day or so. The 
first thing they’ll do is beef

up their planetary defenses to 
match. That way, we’d blow 
all their ships out of space, 
probably easily enough, but 
Strett itself will be just as 
safe as though it were in 
God’s left-hand hip pocket. So 
what’s the answer?” 

“It isn’t that simple, Jarve,” 
Sawtelle said. “Let’s hear 
from you, Kedy.” 

“Thank you, sir. There is 
an optimum mass, a point of 
maximum efficiency of fire- 
power as balanced against loss 
of maneuverability, for any 
craft designed for attack,” 
Kedy thought, in his most 
professonial manner. “We as- 
sume that the Stretts know 
that as well as we do. No such 
limitation applies to strictly 
defensive structures, but both 
the Strett craft and ours must 
be designed for attack. We 
have built and are building 
many hundreds of thousands 
of ships of that type. So, un- 
doubtedly, are the Stretts. 
Ship for ship, they will be 
pretty well matched. There- 
fore one part of my strategy 
will be for two of our ships to 
engage simultaneously one of 
theirs. There is a distinct 
probability that we will have 
enough advantage in speed of 
control to make that tactic 
operable.” 

“But there’s another that we 
won’t,” Sawtelle objected. 
“And maybe they can build 
more ships than we can.” 

“Another point is that they 
may build, in addition to their 
big stuff, a lot of small, ultra- 

115 





fast ones,” Hilton put in. 
“Suicide jobs — crash and de- 
tonate — simply super-missiles. 
How sure are you that you 
can stop such missiles with 
ordinary beams?” 

“Not at all, sir. Some of 
them would of course reach 
and destroy some of our ships. 
Which brings up the second 
part of my strategy. For each 
one of the heavies, we are 
building many small ships of 
the type you just called ‘su- 
per-missiles’.” 

“Superdreadnoughts versus 
superdreadnoughts, super- 
missiles versus super-mis- 
siles.” Hilton digested that 
concept for several minutes. 
“That could still wind up as 
a stalemate, except for what 
you said about control. That 
isn’t much to depend on, es- 
pecially since we won’t have 
the time-lag advantage you 
Omans had before. They’ll see 
to that. Also, I don’t like to 
sacrifice a million Omans, 
either.” 

iiT haven’t explained the 

A newest development yet,

ties. All of us together make 
up the actual Kedy — that 
which is meant when we say 
T’. That is, I am the sum total 
of all Kedys everywhere, not 
merely this individual that 
you call Kedy One.” 

“You mean you’re all talk- 
ing to me?” 

“Exactly, sir. Thus, no one 
element of the Kedy has any 
need of, or any desire for, 
s e 1 f-preservation. The de- 
struction of one element, or 
of thousands of elements, 
would be of no more conse- 
quence to the Kedy than... 
well, they are strictly ana- 
logous to the severed ends of 
the hairs, every time you get 
a haircut.” 

“My God!” Hilton stared 
at Sawtelle. Sawtelle stared 
back. “I’m beginning to see 
...maybe... I hope. What 
control that would be! But 
just in case we should have 
to use the boosters...” Hil- 
ton’s voice died away. Scowl- 
ing in concentration, he 
clasped his hands behind his 
back and began to pace the 
floor. 

“Better give up, Jarve. 
Kedy’s got the same mind 
you have,” Sawtelle began, to 
Hilton’s oblivious back; but 
Kedy silenced the thought 
almost in the moment of its 
inception. 

“By no means, sir,” he con- 
tradicted. “I have the brain 
only. The mind is entirely 
different.’* 

“Link up, Kedy, and see 
what you think of this,” Hil- 



Edward E. Smith & E« Everett Evans 




ton broke in. There ensued 
an interchange of thought so 
fast and so deeply mathemat- 
ical that Sawtelle was lost 
in seconds. “Do you think 
it'll work?" 

*T don't see how it can fail, 
sir. At what point in the ac- 
tion should it be put into ef- 
fect? And will you call the 
time of initiation, or shall 
I?" 

“Not until all their reserves 
are in action. Or, at worst, 
all of ours except that one 
task-force. Since you'll know 
a lot more about the status of 
the battle than either Saw- 
telle or I will, you give the 
signal and I’ll start things 
going." 

“What are you two talking 
about?" Sawtelle demanded. 

“It’s a long story, chum. 
Kedy can tell you about it 
better than I can. Besides, it's 
getting late and Dark Lady 
and Larry both give me hell 
every time I hold supper on 
plus time unless there’s a 
mighty good reason for it. 
So, so long, guys.” 

XV 

POR many weeks the pro- 

duction of Ardan warships 
and missiles had been spiral- 
ing upward. 

Half a mountain range of 
solid rock had been converted 
into fabricated super-steel and 
armament. Superdreadnoughts 
were popping into existence 
at the rate of hundreds per 
minute. Missiles were rolling 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



off the ends of assembly lines 
like half-pint tin cans out of 
can-making machines. 

The Strett warcraft, skele- 
tons and missiles, would 
emerge into normal space any- 
where within a million miles 
of Ardvor. The Ardan missiles 
were powered for an accelera- 
tion of one hundred gravities. 
That much the Kedy brains, 
molded solidly into teflon- 
lined, massively braced steel 
spheres, could just withstand. 

To be certain of breaking 
the Strett screens, an impact 
velocity of about six miles per 
second was necessary. 'The 
time required to attain this 
velocity was about ten sec- 
onds, and the flight distance 
something over thirty miles.^ 

Since the Stretts could ori- 
ent themselves in less than 
one second after emergence, 
even this extremely tight 
packing of missiles — only six- 
ty miles apart throughout the 
entire emergence volume of 
space — ^would still give the 
Stretts the initiative by a 
time-ratio of more than ten 
to one. 

Such tight packing was of 
course impossible. It called 
for many billions of defend- 
ers instead of the few millions 
it was possible for the Omans 
to produce in the time they 
had. In fact, the average spac- 
ing was well over ten thou- 
sand miles when the invading 
horde of Strett missiles 
emerged and struck. 

How they struck! 

There was nothing of fi- 

117 




nesse about that attack; noth- 
ing of skill or of tactics : noth- 
ing but the sheer brute force 
of overwhelming superiority 
of numbers and of over- 
matching power. One instant 
all space was empty. The next 
instant it was full of invading 
missiles — a superb exhibition 
of coordination and timing. 

And the Kedy control, upon 
which the defenders had 
counted so heavily, proved 
useless. For each Strett mis- 
sile, within a fraction of a sec- 
ond of emergence, darted to- 
ward the nearest Oman mis- 
sile with an acceleration that 
made the one-hundred-gravity 
defenders seem to be standing 
still. 

One to one, missiles crashed 
into missiles and detonated. 
There were no solid or liquid 
end-products. Each of those 
frightful weapons carried so 
many megatons-equivalent of 
atomic concentrate that all 
nearby space blossomed out 
into superatomic blasts hun- 
dreds of times more violent 
than the fireballs of lithium- 
hydride fusion bombs. 

For a moment even Hilton 
was stunned; but only for a 
moment. 

‘‘Kedy!^’ he barked. ‘‘Get 
your big stuff out there! Use 
the boosters!'* He started for 
the door at a full run. “That 
tears it — that really tears it! 
Scrap the plan. I'll board the 
Sirius and take the task-force 
to Strett. Bring your stuff 
along. Skipper, as soon as 
you're ready.' 
lie 



A RDAN superdreadnoughts 
in their massed thousands 
poured out through Ardvor's 
one-way screen. Each went in- 
stantly to work. Now the 
Kedy control system, doing 
what it was designed to do, 
proved its full worth. For the 
weapons of the big battle-wag- 
ons did not depend upon ac- 
celeration, but were driven at 
the speed of light; and Grand 
Fleet Operations were 
planned and were carried out 
at the almost infinite velocity 
of thought itself. 

Or, rather, they were not 
planned at all. They were sim- 
ply carried out, immediately 
and without confusion. 

For all the Kedys were one. 
Each Kedy element, without 
any lapse of time whatever 
for consultation with any 
other, knew exactly where 
every other element was; ex- 
actly what each was doing; 
and exactly what he himself 
should do to make maximum 
contribution to the common 
cause. 

Nor was any time lost in re- 
laying orders to crewmen 
within the ship. There were 
no crewmen. Each Kedy ele- 
ment was the sole personnel 
of, and was integral with, his 
vessel. Nor were there any 
wires or relays to impede and 
slow down communication. 
Operational instructions, too, 
were transmitted and were 
acted upon with thought's 
transfinite speed. Thus, if de- 
cision and execution were not 
quite mathematically simulta- 



by Edward E. Smitli & E. Everett Evans 




neous, they were separated by 
a period of time so infinitesi- 
mally small as to be impossi- 
ble of separation. 

Wherever a Strett missile 
was, or wherever a Strett 
skeleton-ship appeared, an 
Oman beam reached it, usual- 
ly in much less than one sec- 
ond. Beam clung to screen — 
caressingly, hungrily — absorb- 
ing its total energy and form- 
ing the first-stage booster. 
Then, three microseconds 
'ater, that booster went off 
into a ragingly incandescent, 
glaringly violent burst of fury 
so hellishly, so inconceivably 
hot that less than a thousandth 
of its total output of energy 
was below the very top of the 
visible spectrum! 

If the previous display of 
atomic violence had been so 
spectacular and of such mag- 
nitude as to defy understand- 
ing or description, what of 
this? When hundreds of thou- 
sands of Kedys, each wield- 
ing world-wrecking powers as 
effortlessly and as deftly and 
as precisely as thought, at- 
tacked and destroyed millions 
of those tremendously power- 
ful war-fabrications of the 
Stretts? The only simple an- 
swer is that all nearby space 
might very well have been 
torn out of the most radiant 
layers of S-Doradus itself. 

H ilton made the hundred 
yards from office door to 
curb in just over twelve sec- 
onds. Larry was waiting. The 
car literally burned a hole in 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



the atmosphere as it screamed 
its way to Ardane Field. 

It landed with a thump; 
Heavy black streaks of syn- 
thetic rubber marked the 
pavement as it came to a 
screeching, shrieking stop at 
the flagship's main lock. And, 
in the instant of closing that 
lock's outer portal, all twen- 
ty-thousand-plus warships of 
the task force took off as one 
at ten gravities. Took off, and 
in less than one minute went 
into overdrive. 

All personal haste was now 
over. Hilton went up into 
what he still thought of as 
the “control room," even 
though he knew that there 
were no controls, nor even 
any instruments, anywhere 
aboard. He knew what he 
would find there. Fast as he 
had acted. Temple had not 
had as far to go and she had 
got there first. 

He could not have said, for 
the life of him, how he actual- 
ly felt about this direct defi- 
ance of his direct orders. He 
walked into the room, sat 
down beside her and took her 
hand. 

“I told you to stay home, 
Temple," he said. 

“I know you did. But I’m 
not only the assistant head of 
your Psychology Department. 
I'm your wife, remember? 
‘Until death do us part.' And 
if there's any way in the uni- 
verse I can manage it, death 
isn't going to part us^ — at 
least, this pne isn’t. If this is 
it, we'll go together."

to the production and installa- 
tion of enough weapons to 
stop this whole fleet?” 

‘‘It surely won’t. They’ve 
had the absorption principle 
for ages. Remember that first,

all the power of our suits and 
boats in nothing flat? From 
there it isn’t too big a jump.

‘T see... I’m afraid. We’re 
almost there, darling.” 

He glanced at the chro- 
nometer. “About eleven min- 
utes. And of course I don’t 
need to ask you to stay out 
of the way.” 

“Of course not. I won’t in- 
terfere, no matter what hap- 
pens. All I’m going to do is 
hold your hand and pull for 
you with all my might.” 
“That’ll help, believe me. 
I’m mighty glad you’re along, 
sweetheart. Even though both 
of us know you shouldn’t be.” 

T he task force emerged. 

Each ship darted toward 
its pre-assigned place in a 
mathematically exact envelope 
around the planet Strett. 

Hilton sat on a davenport 
strained and still. His eyes 
were closed and every muscle 
tense. Left hand gripped the 
arm-rest so fiercely that fin- 
gertips were inches deep in 
the leather-covered padding. 
The Stretts knew that any 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



such attack as this was futile. 
No movable structure or any 
combination of such struc- 
tures could possibly wield 
enough power to break down 
screens powered by such en- 
gines as theirs. 

Hilton, however, knew that 
there was a chance. Not with 
the first-stage boosters, which 
were manipulable and de- 
tonable masses of ball light- 
ning, but with those boosters’ 
culminations, the Vangs ; 
which were ball lightning 
raised to the sixth power and 
which only the frightful en- 
ergies of the boosters could 
bring into being. 

But, even with tv/enty- 
thousand-plus Vangs — or any 
larger number — success de- 
pended entirely upon a nicety 
of timing never before ap- 
proached and supposedly im- 
possible. Not only to thou- 
sandths of a microsecond, but 
to a small fraction of one such 
thousandth: roughly, the time 
it takes light to travel three- 
sixteenths of an inch. 

It would take practically ab- 
solute simultaneity to over- 
load to the point of burnout 
to those Strett generators. 
They were the heaviest in the 
Galaxy. 

That was why Hilton him- 
self had to be there. He could 
not possibly have done the job 
from Ardvor. In fact, there 
was no real assurance that, 
even at the immeasurable 
velocity of thought and cov- 
ering a mere million miles, he 
could do it even from his pres- 

121 




ent position aboard one unit 
of the fleet. Theoretically, 
with his speed-up, he could. 
But that theory had yet to be 
reduced to practice. 

Tense and strained, Hilton 
began his countdown. 

Temple sat beside him. 
Both hands pressed his right 
fist against her breast. Her 
eyes, too, were closed ; she was 
as stiff and as still as was he. 
She was not interfering, but 
giving; supporting him, back- 
ing him, giving to him in fuH 
flood everything of that tre- 
mendous inner strength that 
had made Temple Bells what 
she so uniquely was. 

On the exact center of the 
needle-sharp zero beat every 
Kedy struck. Gripped and ac- 
tivated as they all were 
by Hilton’s keyed-up-and- 
stretched-out mind, they 
struck in what was very close 
indeed to absolute unison. 

Absorbing beams, each one 
having had precisely the same 
number of millimeters to trav- 
el, reached the screen at the 
same instant. They clung and 
sucked. Immeasurable floods 
of energy flashed from the 
Strett generators into those 
vortices to form twenty thou- 
sand-plus first-stage boosters. 

B ut this time the boosters 
did not detonate. 

Instead, as energies contin- 
ued to flood in at a frightful- 
ly accelerating rate, they 
turned into something else. 
Things no Terran science has 
ever even imagined; things at 

122 



the formation of which all 
neighboring space actually 
warped, and in that warping 
seethed and writhed and shud- 
dered. The very sub-ether 
screamed and shrieked in pro- 
test as it, too, yielded in 
starkly impossible fashions to 
that irresistible stress. 

How even those silicon- 
fluorine brains stood it, not 
one of them ever knew. 

Microsecond by slow micro- 
second the Vangs grew and 
grew and grew. They were 
pulling not only the full pow- 
er of the Ardan warships, but 
also the immeasurably greater 
power of the strainingly over- 
loaded Strettsian generators 
themselves. The ethereal and 
sub-ethereal writhings and 
distortions and screamings 
grew worse and worse ; harder 
and ever harder to bear. 

Imagine, if you can, a con- 
stantly and rapidly increasing 
mass of plutonium — a mass al- 
ready thousands of times 
greater than critical, but not 
allowed to react! That gives 
a faint and very inadequate 
picture of what was happen- 
ing then. 

Finally, at perhaps a hun- 
dred thousand times critical 
mass, and still in perfect sync, 
the Vangs all went off. 

The planet Strett became a 
nova. 

“We won! We wonT Tem- 
ple shrieked, her perception 
piercing through the hellish 
murk that was all nearby 
space. 

“Not quite yet, sweet, but 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




we're over the biggest hump/' 
and the two held an im- 
promptu, but highly satis- 
factory, celebration. 

Perhaps it would be better 
to say that the planet Strett 
became a junior-grade nova, 
since the actual nova stage 
was purely superficial and did 
not last very long. In a cou- 
ple of hours things had quiet- 
ed down enough so that the 
heavily-screened warships 
could approach the planet and 
finish up their part of the 
job. 

Much of Strett's land sur- 
face was molten lava. Much 
of its water was gone. There 
were some pockets of re- 
sistance left, of course, but 
they did not last long. Equal- 
ly of course the Stretts them- 
selves, twenty-five miles un- 
derground, had not been 
harmed at all. 

But that, too, was according 
to plan. 

L eaving the task force on 
guard, to counter any move 
the Stretts might be able to 
make, Hilton shot the Sirius 
out to the planet’s moon. 
There Sawtelle and his staff 
and tens of thousands of 
Omans and machines were 
starting to work. No part of 
this was Hilton’s job; so all 
he and Temple did was look 
on. 

Correction, please. That was 
not all they did. But while 
resting and eating and loaf- 
ing and sleeping and enjoying 
each other’s compariy, both 
MASTERS OF SPACE 



watched Operation Moon 
closely enough to be complete- 
ly informed as to everything 
that went on. 

Immense, carefully placed 
pits went down to solid bed- 
rock. To that rock were im- 
movably anchored structures 
strong enough to move a 
world. Driving units were in- 
stalled — drives of such im- 
mensity of power as to test 
to the full the highest engin- 
eering skills of the Galaxy. 
Mountains of fuel-concentrate 
filled vast reservoirs of con- 
crete. Each was connected to 
a drive by fifty-inch high- 
speed conveyors. 

Sawtelle drove a thought 
and those brutal super-drives 
began to blast. 

As they blasted, Strett’s 
satellite began to move out of 
its orbit. Very slowly at first, 
but faster and faster. They 
continued to blast, with all 
their prodigious might and in 
carefully-computed order, un- 
til the desired orbit was at- 
tained — an orbit which ter- 
minated in a vertical line 
through the center of the 
Stretts’ supposedly impreg- 
nable retreat. 

The planet Strett had a 
mass of approximately seven 
times ten to the twenty-first 
metric tons. Its moon, little 
more than a hundredth as 
massive, still weighed in at 
about eight times ten to the 
nineteenth — that is, the figure 
eight followed by nineteen 
zeroes. 

And moon fell on planet, in 

123 




direct central impact, after 
having fallen from a height 
of over a quarter of a million 
miles under the full pull of 
gravity and the full thrust of 
those mighty atomic drives. 

The kinetic energy of such 
a collision can be computed. 
It can be expressed. It is, 
however, of such astronomical 
magnitude as to be completely 
meaningless to the human 
mind. 

Simply, the two worlds 
merged and splashed. Drop- 
lets, weighing up to millions 
of tons each, spattered out 
into space; only to return, in 
seconds or hours or weeks or 
months, to add their atrocious 
contributions to the enormity 
of the destruction already 
wrought. 

No trace survived of any 
Strett or of any thing, how- 
ever small, pertaining to the 
Stretts. 

Epilogue 

A S had become a daily cus- 
tom, most of the Ardans 
were gathered at the natatori- 
um. Hilton and Temple were 
wrestling in the water — she 
was trying to duck him and 
he was hard put to it to keep 
her from doing it. The plat- 
inum-haired twins were — oh, 
ever so surreptitiously and in- 
detectably ! — studying the oth- 
er girls. 

Captain Sawtelle — he had 
steadfastly refused to accept 
any higher title — and his wife 
were teaching two of their 
tiny grandchildren to swim. 

124 



In short, everything was 
normal. 

Beverly Bell Poynter, from 
the top platform, hit the board 
as hard as she could hit it; 
and, perfectly synchronized 
with it, hurled herself up- 
ward. Up and up and up she 
went. Up to her top ceiling 
of two hundred ten feet. Then, 
straightening out into a shape- 
ly arrow and without again 
moving a muscle, she hurtled 
downward, making two and a 
half beautifully stately turns 
and striking the water with a 
slurping, splashless chug! 
Coming easily to the surface, 
she shook the water out of her 
eyes. 

Temple, giving up her at- 
tempts to near-drown her hus- 
band, rolled over and floated 
quietly beside him. 

“You know, this is fun,” he 
said. 

“Uh-Tzu/z,” she agreed en- 
thusiastically. 

“I’m glad you and Sandy 
buried the hatchet. Two of the 
top women who ever lived. Or 
should I have said sheathed 
the claws? Or have you, real- 
ly?” 

“Pretty much... I guess.” 
Temple didn’t seem altogether 
sure of the point. “Oh-oh. 
Now what?” 

A flitabout had come to 
ground. Dark Lady, who nev- 
er delivered a message via 
thought if she could possibly 
get away with delivering it in 
person, was running full tilt 
across the sand toward them. 
Her long black hair was 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




streaming out behind her ; she 
was waving a length of tele- 
type tape as though it were a 
pennon. 

“Oh, no. Not again?** Tem- 
ple wailed. “Don’t tell us it’s 
Terra again, Dark Lady, 
please." 

“But it is I" Dark Lady 
cried, excitedly. “And it says 
‘From Five-Jet Admiral Gor- 
don, Commanding.’ " 

“Omit flowers, please," Hil- 
ton directed. “Boil it down." 

“The Perseus is in orbit 
with the whole Advisory 
Board. They want to hold a 
top-level summit conference 
with Director Hilton and 
Five-Jet Admiral Sawtelle.” 
Dark Lady raised her voice 
enough to be sure Sawtelle 
heard the title, and shot him 
a wicked glance as she an-

nounced it. “They hope to 
conclude all unfinished busi- 
ngs on a mutually satisfac- 
tory and profitable basis." 

“Okay, Lady, thanks. Tell 
’em we’ll call ’em shortly." 

Dark Lady flashed away 
and Hilton and Temple swam 
slowly toward a ladder. 

“Drat Terra and everything 
and everybody on it," Temple 
said, vigorously. “And espe- 
cially drat His Royal Fatness 
Five- Jet Admiral Gordon. 
How much longer will it take, 
do you think, to pound some 
sense into their pointed little 
heads?" 

“Oh, we’re not doing too 
bad,” Hilton assured his love- 
ly bride. “Two or three more 
sessions ought to do it." 

Everything was normal...

my two bits worth in, to ease 
my conscience — for your egos, 
your Hue and Cry or your 
“circular file.” I imagine that 
you have a dump truck full of 



126 




these letters by now. But a 
fairly recent convert to sf 
wishes to comment anyway. 

I have had you and Galaxy 
on my “must read or else’* list 
for quite some time. My only 
gripe is that each of you is 
bi-monthly. Is good material 
THAT scarce? If so — please 
keep it good — and bi-monthly 
if necessary. 

Though all were refreshing 
to a degree in your September 
yarns, I especially enjoyed 
The Frozen Planet, Valley of 
the Masters, Mirror Image 
and Lorelei. Though long on 
Mickey SpiUane and short on 
science — The Frozen Planet 
was very little short of being 
terrific. 

Science Briefs seemed, at 
least in your past two issues, 
like a poor man’s For Your 
Information. Howzabout elab- 
oration — or another approach? 

Cheers! And keep up the 
good work !

Dear Editor: 

The August issue of Gal- 
axy was a good one, as was 
the September issue of If. 
The cover on Galaxy, how- 
ever, was not up to Emsh’s 
own standards, while Wen- 
zel’s was. As far as contents 
go they both were good with 
The Moon Moth, The God 
Next Door. The Frozen 
Planet. of the Mas- 

ters, Mirror Image, Spawn- 



ing Ground and ToIIivePs 
Orbit standing out above all. 

Some authors whom you 
celebrate have not appeared 
recently, and I wish they 
would. Here they are: 

Fredric Brown 
Edgar Pangborn 
F. L. Wallace 
Robert Sheckley 
Zenna Henderson 
Clifford D. Simak 
Robert Bloch 
Christopher Grimm 
Robert Silverberg 
Alan E. Nourse 
Damon Knight 
Evelyn E. Smith 
Robert Heinlein 
Alfred Bester 
James Blish 
Theodore Sturgeon 
— and others.

* We wish they would, too. 
We keep asking them. — Ed.

Dear Editor: 

You must be Frederik Pohl. 
No other editor, especially not 
H.L. Gold, who abandoned the 
idea of a Galaxy letter column 
simply because the readers 
were against it, would go 
against what are obviously the 
readers’ wishes. Readers like 
longer letters, even if it means 
leaving them uncut, in ex- 
treme cases. Not letters pages 
long, to be sure, nor 10 pages 
of letters. That would be the 
opposite extreme. But to be 
interesting, the letters must be 



127 




more than one short para- 
graph, with space enough to 
say nothing but “I liked this 
but didn’t like that.” By put- 
ting your own comments down 
to the size of the comments of 
the readers, and maybe upping 
the pages of letters to five, in- 
stead of three, If can again 
have one of the best letter 
columns in sf.,.and, believe 
me, it needs to have the best 
of something. 

In the September If (which 
should be subtitled Worlds of 
Galaxy Rejects) you had a 
nice cover, but by the interior 
illos I can only assume that 
your Art Director is black and 
white blind (the opposite of 
color blind.) As far as in- 
terior illustrations go, I rate 
F&SF before Galaxy and If, 

It seems incredible that any- 
one should have accepted such 
a story as The Frozen Planet, 
Even Imaginative Tales would 
have rejected this one .

♦ Art? We* re working on it. 
Starting next issue, you*ll see 
changes. Letter column? 
We*re still not all the way 
convinced — despite what we 
admit to he a lot of mail urg- 
ing a 1-0- n-g one — for all it 
really proves is that letter- 
writing readers like letters 
( which we already know.) 
What about those who don*t?

Dear Editor: 

Here is hoping for a much 
bigger and better “Hue and 
Cry” next time. The present 
issue of If with The Frozen 
Planet was better than it has 
been for quite some time.

Gentlemen: 

I have just finished read- 
ing your September If. I en- 
joyed it very much. Keep up 
the good work! It had every- 
thing I could want, except 
no book review. I would like 
to see it back.

Dear Editor: 

Congratulations for an If 
which is getting better every 
issue. Most of the stories arc 
actually readable now. A 

couple months back, I was 
lucky to find one or two de- 
cent ones in a whole ish. 

Best stories in the Sep- 

tember If were Spawning 
Ground (let’s have more del 
Rey) and Valley of the Mas- 
ters. Blackford seems like a 
pretty good new writer. 

Sturgeon is good on the 
features, but how about some 
stories from him?

* Yeah, how about that, 
Ted?— Ed.

Dear Editor: 

Thank heavens you’re not 
planning to have 10 to 16 
pages of letters ! Eyen the 
old' If seldom, if ever, had 
more than (at the most) 5 
pages for letters. 

I do regret, though, that 
you’re not planning to run 
book reviews again in the 
near future... but with a 
book review column in 4 of 
the 6 If magazines being pub- 
lished, you might as well use 
the extra space for more fic- 
tion. 

I think that If has been im- 
proving with every issue since 
the time Twelve Times Zero 
was published. Now, with the 
Lester del Rey story in the 
September issue and the ‘"Sky- 
lark’" Smith-E. E. Evans col- 
laboration scheduled, you may 
have hit an all-time high.

Dear Editor: 

I picked up the new If yes- 
terday, mainly because my 
friend Lawrence Crilly sug- 
gested it, and when I saw you 
had a story by my current fa- 
vorite — Keith Laumer, with 
The Frozen Planet — I bought 
it. I just finished reading the 
mag and I can only say 
WOW! From a mag that 
should have been discontinued 
long ago you jump right up 
into the front rank! I can only 



offer my sincerest congratula- 
tions. 

Laumer is superb. A little of 
Russell, a little of William- 
son, a little of the best Leins- 
ter and a lot of his capable 
self combine to make him the 
best new writer since Schmitz.

Dear Editor: 

Why not get the readers to 
hold written discussions in 
Hue and Cry? As a starter, 
why not have the readers try 
to pin down the meaning of 
and idea behind the oft-used, 
ambiguous term “sense of 
wonder?” Book reviewers 
have long since worn out this 
term. .and have yet to define 
it.

That’s the works — not all 
the mail we have, but all we 
can find room for. Thanks to 
all of you. 

Next issue? Some fine sto- 
ries coming up. Poul Ander- 
son, Fritz Leiber, Keith Lau- 
mer, Jim Harmon, Kris Ne- 
ville, Allen Kim Lang and a 
dozen others have some real- 
ly first-rate stuff on hand. 
We’re not sure yet which 
will fit in — but we’re sure 
you’ll find something you 
like — next issue, and every 
issue to come! END
