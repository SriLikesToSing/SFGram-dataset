Named Death 

By CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




D AN REDMAN walked 
swiftly and quietly down 
the broad hallway toward a 
door lettered : 

A SECTION 
J. KIELGAARD 
DIRECTOR 

As Dan opened the door, 
his trained glance caught the 
brief reflection of a strange, 
strong-featured face, and a 
lithe, powerful, and unfa- 
miliar physique. Dan accepted 
this unfamiliar reflection of 
himself as an actor accepts 
makeup. What puzzled him 
was the peculiar silent smooth- 
ness with which his hand 
turned the knob, while his 
shoulder braced firmly and 
easily against the opening 
door. He stepped into the 
room in one sudden quiet mo- 
tion. 

The receptionist inside gave 
a visible start. 

What kind of a job, Dan 
asked himself, did Kielgaard 
have for him this time? 

The receptionist recovered 
her poise, to usher Dan into 
the inner office. 



7 




Kielgaard — big, stocky, and 
expensively dressed — glanced 
up from a sheaf of glossy 
photographs. He said bluntly, 
“Sit down. We’ve got a mess 
to straighten out.” 

“What’s wrong?” 

“A few years back, Galactic 
Enterprises discovered a to- 
tally undeveloped planet with 
no inhabitants. They claimed 
development rights and got to 
work to find an economical 
route to the planet, which is 
called Triax.” 

Kielgaard snapped a switch 
on the edge of his desk and 
the room lights dimmed out. 
Three stellar maps seemed to 
hang in space in front of Dan, 
one map directly above the 
other. 

Kielgaard’s voice said, “Ga- 
lactic found a route to Triax 
that promised to be very eco- 
nomical. Watch.” 

O N THE lowest map, the 
word “Earth” lit up, and 
a silver line grew out from it 
along the stellar map, then 
jumped up in a vertical 
straight line to the second 
map, traveled along this map 
almost to a place where the 
word “Truth” lit up. The 
line then jumped straight up 
to the third map and traveled 
along it to the word “Triax.” 
The room lighted and the 
maps vanished. 

Kielgaard said, “In two 
subspace jumps and not too 
much normal-space traveling, 
Galactic can ship a cargo 

8 



from Triax to Earth. That’s 
a good, short route," but it 
comes too close to that planet 
called Truth.” 

Dan said, “Truth is the na- 
tive name for the planet?” 

“Exactly. Truth is inhab- 
ited. The inhabitants look 
much like us, and they’re very 
highly developed technologi- 
cally, though there is no sign 
that they use space travel in 
any form. The problem is 
that Galactic’s cargo ships 
will pass close enough to 
Truth so that the inhabitants 
— call them Truthians — will 
eventually detect them and 
may or may not like the idea. 
Galactic’s worry is that after 
sinking a lot of money into 
the development of Triax, and 
just as it’s about to make a 
profit on the planet, these 
Truthians may blossom out 
with a fleet of commerce raid- 
ers, or else claim sovereignty 
over all contiguous space and 
land Galactic in a big court 
fight.” Kielgaard glanced at 
Dan with a smile. “Suppose 
you were running Galactic 
and had this problem. What 
would you do?” 

“Try to vary the route. But 
subspace being what it is, a 
mild variation of the starting 
point can produce an abrupt 
shift in the place where they 
come out.” 

Kielgaard nodded. “There’s 
probably a usable route, but 
there’s no telling when they’ll 
find it. Meanwhile, the devel- 
opment license only runs so 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




long before Galactic has to 
show proof of progress.” 
“What’s this Truth look 
like?” 

“Earth-type, with cities 
and towns scattered over its 
surface at random, some of 
the cities remarkably advanc- 
ed, some antique, with forest 
and wilderness in between, 
and only haphazard communi- 
cations between cities.” 

Dan frowned. “Well, then, 
I'd set down an information 
team, brain-spy some of the 
inhabitants, and ease agents 
into key cities and towns. At 
the same time, I’d go on look- 
ing for a new route, and do 
enough work on Triax to keep 
the development, license. When 
things clear up on Truth, I’d 
develop Triax further.” 
Kielgaard nodded. “A sound 
and sensible plan. That is 
exactly what Galactic did. 
And after a slow start, things 
began to straighten out very 
nicely, too. The more Truth 
cleared up, the more Galactic 
invested in Triax. And then, 
one day, this photograph 
came in.” 

Kielgaard held out a photo- 
graph showing a busy street 
corner in a city at night. A 
brightly clothed crowd was 
walking along the sidewalk 
past store windows showing 
a variety of merchandise. 

Kielgaard said, “Look down 
that street. You see a low 
building, part way down the 
block, with a wide chimney?” 
“Yes,” said Dan, “I see it.” 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



“Look just above the top of 
the chimney.” 

“You mean this arrow- 
shaped constellation?” 

Kielgaard nodded. “There 
is no such arrow-shaped con- 
stellation visible from Truth.” 
“Then this photo is a 
fake?” 

“They’re all fakes. What 
apparently happened is that 
someone managed to get a spy 
into Galactic’s planning divi- 
sion, and through him found 
out when and where Galactic’s 
agents were to be set down. 
They grabbed the agents one 
by one soon after each agent 
landed. Since then, they’ve 
sent back reports to build up 
a purely synthetic picture of 
the planet. The only reports 
Galactic can rely on are the 
original impressions of the 
information, team they set 
down to begin with.” 

Dan whistled. “So someone 
is working Galactic into posi- 
tion to jerk the rug out from 
under it.” 

“Exactly.” 

“What’s Galactic doing?” 
“They’re trying hard to 
keep this quiet. But mean- 
while, no one knows for sure 
who the spy is.” 

“A nice situation,” said 
Dan. “What do we do about 
this planet Truth?” 

“YVTELL,” said Kielgaard, 
▼ » “the first thing we do 
is set a man down and let him 
get the lay of the land. We 
get more agents ready to 

9 




move in right behind him. 
We intend to use the best men 
available, and nothing but the 
latest and best equipment. If 
things turn out as we intend 
them to, whatever organiza- 
tion started this will come out 
slit up the middle, stuffed, 
roasted, and with an apple in 
its mouth.” 

Dan said cautiously, “Who’s 
the first agent we set down on 
this planet?” 

“You,” said Kielgaard. 
“And you’re going to be up 
against a deadly proposition. 
Our opponent is established 
on the planet, and we’re going 
in cold. Fortunately, we’ve 
sunk a good part of our profits 
into research and it’s about to 
pay off. We have, for in- 
stance, installed in your body 
cavity a remarkably small or- 
gano-transceiver. It uses a 
new type of signal which 
should escape detection under 
any circumstances you’re like- 
ly to face on Truth.” 

*<CO I can be more or less 
^ constantly in touch with 
you?” 

“In any period of relative 
calm, yes. During violent ac- 
tion, the interference of other 
currents in your brain would 
drown out the signal. But 
we’ve also run a series of deli- 
cate taps to your optic and 
auditory nerves, so we should 
have continuous contact by 
sight and sound.” 

“You mentioned that the 
cities and towns on the planet 

10 



were separated by wilderness. 
How do I travel?” 

“We have a new type of un- 
usually small mataform trans- 
ceiver.” Kielgaard reached in 
a drawer and tossed on his 
desk a smooth olive-colored 
object little larger than a 
package of cigarettes. “The 
range is only a few hundred 
miles, but it uses the new 
type of signal I’ve mentioned, 
which eliminates the problem 
of orbiting a set of satellites 
to relay the signal. The prob- 
lem of first putting the mata- 
form transceiver in the place 
where you want to go is 
tricky, but we have a little 
glider that ought to do the 
trick.” 

He showed Dan how to use 
the glider, and several other 
new items of equipment, then 
frowned and sat back. “The 
worst of this is, we don’t 
know exactly what to expect 
on the planet. Some big or- 
ganization could even be try- 
ing to take over the planetary 
government. If so, a lot will 
depend on what stage things 
are in when you land. To give 
you as much chance as possi- 
ble, your body has been care- 
fully restructured to give you 
exceptional strength and en- 
durance. The neuro-condition- 
ing lab has recreated in your 
nervous system the reflexes of 
one of the deadliest agents 
ever known. Don’t be sur- 
prised if you perform certain 
actions almost before you’re 
aware of your own intentions. 

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




It has to be that way to cut 
down the risks.” 

Dan and Kielgaard shook 
hands, and Dan went out to 
check his equipment. 

Early the next day, he was 
on a fast spaceship to the 
planet called Truth. 

D AN was dropped low over 
the night side of the 
planet in a vaned capsule that 
whirled straight down, burst 
open on contact with the wa- 
ter, and sank. From this cap- 
sule, a small boat nosed out 
toward the coast. 

In the cramped space in- 
side, Dan checked a little 
gauge to be sure the boat’s 
outer layer had adjusted to 
the water around it, so that 
there would be no sharp dif- 
ference in the radiation of 
heat to show up on any infra- 
red detector that might be in 
range. Then the boat nosed 
down with a suck-swish from 
the water- jet engine and be- 
gan to pick up speed. 

Several hours later, a thin 
flexible cable shot out from 
shallow water at the edge of 
the junglelike coastline. The 
cable whipped around the 
trunk of a tree well back from 
the water’s edge, there was a 
faint low hum, a grating 
noise, and something slid up 
over the rocks and pebbles 
and came to rest among the 
tangled trunks and roots of 
the trees. A moment later, 
Dan was out and dragging the 
boat further inland. 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



When he was satisfied that 
the boat was safe, he glanced 
at his watch. The planet's 
large moon should soon be up 
and he intended to waste no 
time making his position 
more secure. 

He broke open a carton of 
the little mataform transceiv- 
ers, clipped several of them 
on small, almost completely 
transparent gliders, and 
checked to be sure the little 
auxiliary motors of the glid- 
ers were in working order. 
He slid on a helmet that fit 
tightly over his head and eyes, 
and sent up the first glider. 
As the faint whir of the small 
engine receded, Dan could see 
before him in the helmet a 
clear view of the sea, with the 
thin rim of the planet's moon 
just rising, huge and blood- 
red, over the horizon. 

The small sensor unit on 
the glider sent back an image 
from a safe height above the 
forest, and Dan switched the 
helmet from this glider long 
enough to send up another. 

By dawn, he had landed 
gliders, with their small mat- 
aform transceivers, in iso- 
lated spots outside three mod- 
erate-sized cities within range 
of the boat. Dan then took 
another of the mataform units 
and buried it. Standing near- 
by, he mentally pronounced a 
key word. 

As he did this, the electro- 
chemical change in a nervous 
tract triggered a tiny im- 
planted device that sent its 

11 




imperceptible signal to the 
mataform transceiver. The 
transceiver interpreted the 
signal, and for an instant Dan 
sensed a shift in the pattern 
of things around him. 

Abruptly he was standing 
in the clearing where he had 
brought down the first glider. 
Around him were several tall 
wind-thrown trees. In the 
gray light of early dawn, he 
could barely make out the 
glider and little mataform 
unit clipped to it. A few min- 
utes later, the unit was tem- 
porarily hidden, he had re- 
turned the glider to the boat, 
and he was picking up the 
second glider in a badly burn- 
ed tract of forest near the 
second city. 

W HEN the three mataform 
units were all hidden, 
Dan paused for a moment to 
think through the next step. 
The three gliders, invisible to 
the naked eye as they passed 
high above the tree tops, 
might possibly have shown up 
on any of a number of detec- 
tion devices, to give away 
both the starting point and 
the places where they had 
landed. It was now Dan's 
problem to outwit these de- 
tection devices. 

Dan clipped another mata- 
form transceiver to a glider, 
put on the control helmet, and 
sent the glider dodging low 
and carefully through the 
trees. He found a spot about 
two miles away that suited 

12 



him and landed the glider. He 
swiftly unloaded the boat and 
carried its contents to the 
buried mataform unit, where 
he mentahy pronounced a new 
key word, which triggered the 
unit and took him to the glid- 
er and transceiver he had just 
landed. In a short time, he 
had the contents of the boat 
stacked beside the glider. 

Dan then disassembled boat 
and engine, and stacked the 
parts beside the boat's piled- 
up contents. By now, the sun 
was well up, and Dan was be- 
coming aware of a thrumming 
drone that grew steadily 
louder. He quickly dug up the 
buried mataform unit, clipped 
it to a glider, and hung the 
glider to an overhead limb by 
a green string knotted so as 
to come undone at the first 
sharp pull. 

Dan glanced around care- 
fully and listened to the in- 
creasing drone. He looked up 
and studied a bumpy blue- 
green limb well overhead. 
This limb was so located that 
a spy unit on it would cover 
most of the place where the 
boat had been. Dan carefully 
gauged the speed with which 
the droning was coming clos- 
er, then went by mataform to 
the pile of goods he had trans- 
ferred, came back with a long 
tube, and sighted at the over- 
head limb. There was a 
whoosh and a small colorless 
blob with a tiny bump in the 
center spread out on the limb. 
The blob gradually turned 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




blue-gray, matching the limb, 
and then the spy unit was in- 
distinguishable from the 
limb’s other bumps and irreg- 
ularities. 

The droning noise was now 
quite loud. 

Dan went by mataform to 
his new camp and put on the 
helmet he used to control the 
glider. 

An instant later, the glider 
gave a whir and jerked for- 
ward. The knot came untied, 
and the glider, carrying the 
mataform unit and a length 
of dark-green string, flitted 
out of sight amid the big tree 
trunks. 

Dan, his hand on a knob at 
the side of the helmet, shifted 
his vision rapidly back and 
forth from the glider to the 
spy unit over the spot where 
the boat had been. 

There now came into view, 
in the place where the boat 
had been, something that 
looked like a cross between an 
oversize bloodhound and a 
tiger. Right behind this came 
a man with a rifle. Then 
another man, and another. 
The angle of vision did not let 
Dan see exactly where the 
men came from, but he sup- 
posed there was a jetcopter 
just overhead. 

The tigerlike animal snuf- 
fled around, pawed at the 
ground, made trips into the 
jungle on all sides, and finally 
ran back toward the shore. 
The men followed close be- 
hind. 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



D AN, shifting his attention 
back and forth from this 
scene to the glider, landed the 
glider nearby just as the last 
of the men left the place 
Where the boat had been. Dan 
quickly went to each of the 
three places near cities where 
he had landed mataform 
transceivers, and moved each 
of them by glider well away, 
from the places where they 
had landed. He left behind in 
each place a small spy unit. 

He had just finished doing 
this when several loads of 
heavily armed men in jetcop- 
ters came down in all three 
places. The men, Dan noticed, 
wore no uniforms, and the 
copters were unmarked. 

Dan said mentally, “Can 
you hear me, Kielgaard?” 
“Loud and clear,” came the 
familiar voice. “We’re get- 
ting sight and sound per- 
fectly.” 

“Have you got your corps 
of experts working on every- 
thing that comes in?” 
“Naturally,” said Kielgaard. 
“But I wouldn’t advise you to 
stop and chat right now. 
Those boys seem to mean bus- 
iness.” 

“Do they look like planetary 
police to you?” 

“No. They don’t look like 
anything that was born on 
that planet.” 

“That’s exactly the way 
they strike me. Well, maybe 
I can make them some more 
trouble.” 

Dan got out a map and 

13 




noted a long, fairly straight 
road from one of the cities 
near which he had a mata- 
form transceiver to another 
distant city. From this dis- 
tant city, a winding river 
curled away to a city even 
more distant. That night, 
Dan intended to make use of 
road and river alike. But 
right now he spent an hour 
or so moving his goods to a 
place further away from the 
landing; then he partly reas- 
sembled the boat, and cat- 
napped till evening. He was 
woken at frequent intervals 
by sudden drops of men and 
more of the tigerlike animals, 
at each of the four places 
where they had been before. 
Each time there was sudden 
activity at one of these places, 
a little alarm buzzed in Dan’s 
ear, and he slid on the helmet 
to watch a renewed search of 
the ground. 

He had the impression that 
someone had reported nothing 
was to be found, and that this 
word had been passed along 
to someone who had said 
there must be something 
there, and it had better be 
found or else. The search this 
time was much more careful. 
But it was not till the last 
place was searched that one 
of them came very close to 
the spy unit, and reached out 
toward it. 

Dan regretfully slid back a 
protective cover at the lower 
edge of the helmet and press- 
ed a button underneath. There 



was a dazzling flash, and then 
the scene was gone. 

Dan would much rather 
have kept them thinking that 
maybe there was nothing to 
look for after all. But he 
could tell from their numbers 
and zeal that he was not likely 
to have very much his own 
way on this planet. 

T HAT night, Dan sent a 
glider under power down 
the long road to the distant 
city. The glider was low 
enough to avoid the usual de- 
tectors, but happily free of 
the need to dodge an endless 
succession of tree trunks. The 
river served much the same 
purpose, so that well before 
dawn, Dan had mataform 
transceivers planted near each 
of the two new cities, and also 
at a place right at the edge 
of the river. From this spot, 
Dan threw out into the river 
a heavily weighted mataform 
transceiver. He returned to 
the partly assembled boat and 
methodically put it together 
again. This time, however, he 
fitted sections together differ- 
ently and left the heavy en- 
gine out entirely. He put his 
arms around one end of the 
thing he had put together and 
mentally said a keyword. 

The river water rushed 
coldly around him, gritty with 
silt sweeping along the bot- 
tom. There was a chug in his 
ears as the water triggered 
off the grab anchors around 
the rim of the shelter. Dan

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




said another key word and he 
was inside. He snapped on a 
light and looked carefully 
around, but found no sign of 
a leak. 

He transferred the rest of 
his goods, checked to see that 
the selective membrane panel 
was keeping the oxygen at the 
right level inside, then lay 
down to catch up on sleep. 

The following day, he took 
three of his small transceiv- 
ers, and went by mataform to 
a place outside the nearest 
city. 

A short walk along a wind- 
ing trail took Dan past a 
series of huts and cabins to a 
rough covered stand display- 
ing combs, brooms, and other 
simple merchandise, along 
with a dusty case of what 
looked like soda pop, and a 
dust-covered carton of what 
appeared to be candy bars. 
The soda pop was labeled 
“GAS,” and the candy had a 
card labeled “TOOTHROT.” 
The girl in charge of the 
stand smiled and said, “Good 
morning, Death.” 

There was no one else 
around, and the girl spoke in 
a perfectly natural way, so 
Dan smiled back and said, 
“Good morning.” 

But as he walked on down 
the trail, he said mentally, 
“Kielgaard?” 

Kielgaard’s voice replied, “I 
heard it, Dan. We’re checking 
at this end to see if it’s some 
error in the vocabulary we 
implanted in your brain.” A 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



moment later, Kielgaard said, 
“As nearly as we can tell here, 
‘Death’ is the word she used.” 
“Funny.” 

Dan rounded a bend in the 
trail and came to a moderately 
wide road, paved with smooth 
blocks of stone. To his right 
was a wall about ten feet high, 
with an open gate and a city 
street visible behind it. From 
somewhere came the steady 
beat of a drum. Dan started 
toward the gate, but had to 
j ump aside as a heavily armed 
column of troops marched out, 
their faces set and their feet 
striking the ground in an un- 
varying cadence. 

As the last of the troops 
went by, a man standing near- 
by turned to Dan and said, 
“Well, there they go. We 
won’t be seeing some of them 
again in this life.” 

Dan nodded noncommitally, 
and the man looked at him 
sharply, then grinned and 
said, “Good hunting.” 

“Thank you,” said Dan. He 
could hear a faint muttering 
somewhere in the background, 
which he took to be Kielgaard 
and his experts, trying to un- 
derstand this latest exchange. 

Dan followed the man 
through the city gates, and 
walked past a variety of small 
shops selling baked goods, 
meats, groceries, hand tools, 
books, and appliances. 

Dan noted the location of 
the bookstore, so that on the 
way back he could buy some 
books. He wanted to transmit 

15 




the contents of the books ; the 
staff of experts could learn a 
great deal from a cross-sec- 
tion of a planet’s fiction and 
non-fiction. 

A S DAN walked toward the 
center of the city, he 
noted that the buildings grew 
larger, and the shops turned 
into big department stores. 
These all looked much the 
same as the ones on Earth, or 
on many other technologically 
advanced planets. The mer- 
chandise showed only minor 
differences in design. Look- 
ing in a hardware store, for 
instance, Dan discovered that 
ordinary screwdrivers had a 
short curved crosspiece on the 
handle — apparently a thumb 
rest to give greater leverage 
in turning. Aside from such 
minor differences, everything 
seemed the same. 

Dan had just decided that 
the planet looked almost like 
home when he came to a low 
building with a paved yard. 
Into the yard trundled several 
small carts, similar to the 
kind used to transfer baggage 
in railroad and mataform de- 
pots back home. On these 
carts, however, were canvas 
covers, which were thrown 
back to reveal fully clothed 
human forms. On all but one 
cart, the human forms wore 
the same kind of white gar- 
ment, trimmed in various 
colors. These forms — bodies, 
Dan supposed — were lifted 
from the carts by attendants 



who handled them with the 
greatest care and respect. 

On the other cart, though, 
the bodies wore street clothes. 
These bodies were grabbed 
under the arms, dragged to a 
black door like the door of a 
furnace, set in the wall of the 
building, and shoved through 
the door head first. As the 
bodies were shoved in, Dan 
saw the sunlight glint on 
what looked like tight metal 
cords around their necks, 
bearing oblong metal tags. 

Several men had stopped 
while Dan glanced in to watch 
this scene. Dan now over- 
heard their comments, which 
were made in tense angry 
tones : 

“Look at that. If this ref- 
erendum isn’t over soon, it’ll 
dust the lot of us over the 
forest.” 

“It’s all these charges and 
accusations that make the 
trouble. Why we can’t do it 
like civilized human beings, I 
don’t know.” 

“The trouble is, there’s no 
precedent.” 

The men walked away. 

Dan had the out-of-focus 
sensation of a man who comes 
into a room where a joke has 
already been half-told. 

He glanced at the low build- 
ing. “Are you getting all 
this, Kiclgaard?” 

“We’re getting it. But I 
hope it makes more sense to 
you than it does to us.” 

“Well, it doesn’t.” 

Dan glanced around, noted 



16 



CHRISTOPHS ANVIL 




the discreet word “disposal” 
printed on the face of the 
small building where the bod- 
ies were shoved through what 
looked like a furnace door. 
Dan thought he could see 
what was going on here, but 
the reasons for the things 
that were happening were to- 
tally obscure to him. 

It was in the next block that 
he began to get some sort of 
an idea, when he saw a large 
poster bearing a blue triangle 
standing point down. Stamped 
over this triangle were large 
letters: VOTE YES! 

Several blocks away was a 
big poster showing a green 
triangle, its base down, and 
bearing the words: VOTE 
NO! 

B OTH posters were dented, 
scratched, and spattered, 
as if stones and rotten fruit 
had been thrown at them. But, 
though Dan watched care- 
fully as he walked on toward 
the center of the city, he saw 
no clue as to what the voting 
was about. He was also puz- 
zled to find that, though there 
were many stores, and a fair 
number of what looked like 
hotels, office buildings, and 
apartment houses, there seem- 
ed to be no factories, large or 
small. 

The people passing here 
were another source of un- 
certainty. As Dan approached 
the center of the city, he be- 
gan to sense the peculiar air 
of freedom that he had no- 



ticed in resort towns on a 
dozen planets. And yet this 
did not look to him like a re- 
sort town. Moreover, it was 
hard to gauge the mood of the 
people passing by, because 
nearly all seemed to react to 
his presence in some way. 
Some looked suddenly alarm- 
ed, a few looked furtive, 
others seemed pleased and 
smiled at him. A considerable 
number of the women had a 
thrilled look when they saw 
him. 

Dan walked another block 
and saw part of the reason 
for the resort-town atmos- 
phere. Across the street was 
a sweeping expanse of green. 
In the far end of this green 
was an enormous swimming 
pool, with floats and concrete 
islands dotted through it to 
hold diving boards that were 
almost constantly in use. 

Dan, wanting to watch 
the passersby without their 
watching him, stepped into 
a quiet, old-fashioned-looking 
bookstore that fronted on the 
green. He looked out the 
many-paned front window 
and immediately noticed a 
change in the people. With- 
out his inexplicably disturb- 
ing influence, nearly all of the 
people fell into two distinct 
categories. One group had a 
depressed and angry look. 
The other group looked cheer- 
ful and carefree. Aside from 
their mood, they didn’t seem 
to differ noticeably in dress, 
age, or any other way. 



A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



17 




Dan glanced around the 
bookstore and saw that it, like 
the other stores, could be 
transplanted to Earth, and — 
except for the unfamiliar let- 
tering on storefront and book 
titles — would hardly be no- 
ticed. He nodded to an elder- 
ly woman working at a small 
desk to one side of the store, 
then walked to the rear, 
where the stacks of books left 
a far comer partially in shad- 
ow and out of sight from the 
front of the store. Dan stoop- 
ed, glanced at the dusty row 
of books on the bottom shelf, 
and slid a mataform trans- 
ceiver behind the books. 

He walked back to the front 
of the store, stepped out on 
the sidewalk, and saw a cart 
come slowly along in the 
street. This was the kind of 
cart he had seen earlier. The 
outstretched figures of men 
lay bumping loosely on the 
cart, metal cords with oblong 
tags tight around their necks. 
Dan stepped over to note that 
the tags he could see all read : 

— KILL — 
UNAUTHORIZED 

T HERE was a buzz of in- 
dignation from the crowd 
on the sidewalk as the cart 
went by. 

Then there was a sudden 
silence. 

Dan glanced around. 
Walking along the sidewalk 
toward him was a man about 
his own height and build, who 

18 



moved with controlled catlike 
steps. 

The man looked directly at 
Dan and called out: “Hello, 
Death!” 

The people on the sidewalk 
rushed to get out of the way. 
Abruptly the man’s arm 
swung back and forward. 

“Catch.” 

Something flashed in the 
air. 

Dan’s impulse was to jump 
aside, then tackle the man. In- 
stead, his body turned slight- 
ly. His right hand, already 
partly raised, whipped in a 
short arc, caught something, 
flicked it to his left, and blurr- 
ed straight out again. 

The man opposite Dan 
blinked and jumped aside. 

At the same instant, Dan’s 
left hand shot out. 

There was a gasp from the 
crowd. The man collapsed 
with the butt of a knife jut- 
ting from his chest. 

A voice behind Dan said 
warmly, “Superb! A return 
attack complete in one 
stroke!” 

Dan turned to see three 
alert, strong-looking men. One 
counted bills from a thick roll. 
The second opened up a square 
case with carrying handle. The 
third was unwinding an arm- 
band with a badge on it. 

The man with the case held 
it out. “If you’ll just put your 
fingertips on these plates, so 
we’ll be sure to get your mat- 
ing credits — ” 

Dan sensed from the wait- 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




in g attitude of the people 
watching that this was some 
kind of test. Unhesitatingly, 
he held out his fingertips. 
There were also two bright 
flashes as a small tube was 
held to Dan's eyes. 

Once Dan could see again, 
everyone seemed relaxed and 
friendly. The crowd was ex- 
citedly arguing the details of 
what had happened. The man 
with the roll of bills handed 
over a small fistful, saying, 
“Double, for the return at one 
stroke." 

The man with the armband 
put it on Dan's arm as he 
rapidly recited the words of 
some rote formula, of which 
all Dan caught was a frequent 
reference to “the Code," and 
the words “peril and deadly 
danger," and the last words, 
“now say, T do.' ” 

“I do," said Dan, fervently 
wishing he were somewhere 
else. 

The man with the case was 
beaming as he snapped the 
little rod inside. He said gen- 
ially, “I always know an hon- 
est fight when I see it. And 
these days it's a real pleasure 
to—" 

Just then, he clapped the 
case shut. 

The case gave out a clang 
like the general alarm on a 
space cruiser under surprise 
attack. 

The crowd gave a shout. 
“Unauthorized kill !" 

The three men beside Dan 
jumped forward. 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



Dan's left hand lashed out 
to smash the nearest of the 
three men in the midsection. 
The flat edge of his right 
hand struck the second man 
just below the nose ; then Dan 
had thrown the first man back 
against the third, had whirled 
around and seen the crowd 
start to surge across the side- 
walk to block his escape. He 
sprinted directly past this 
crowd, so that when it com- 
pletely blocked the sidewalk 
an instant later, he was cut 
off from the view of the three 
men he had just knocked 
down. 

Dan did not doubt that 
these three men were officials 
of the planet, and he strongly 
suspected that they were 
armed and knew how to use 
their weapons. 

A CROSS the street, at. the 
edge of one corner of the 
green, was a tall hedge of 
flowering shrubs, back of 
which was a grove of young 
trees. Dan dodged past carts 
and small, square, silent auto- 
mobiles, and ran through this 
hedge. Behind him there was 
a shout of anger. 

To Dan's left were two 
young trees, growing close to- 
gether. Dan still had with him 
two of his little mataform 
units, and he quickly thrust 
one of them between the two 
dark, slender tree trunks. 

An instant later, he was 
in the dark corner of the 
bookstore, hearing the angry 

19 




shouts dwindle into the dis- 
tance outside. The door of the 
store closed as the elderly wo- 
man who ran the store step- 
ped outside, apparently to see 
what had happened. 

A moment later, Dan was 
in the shelter under the river. 
He worked quickly with a 
small brush and some dye, 
then got out another set of 
clothes. He checked his ap- 
pearance swiftly and thor- 
oughly. 

Then, with more of a tan- 
ned look than he had had be- 
fore, with much darker hair, 
and wearing entirely different 
clothes, Dan mataformed back 
to the bookstore. The elderly 
woman was standing by the 
front window as he came for- 
ward, to pick up a thin scien- 
tific volume lying on a table 
and say, “I believe you were 
outside when I came in.” 

“Oh,” she said, “the most 
frightful thing just happen- 
ed.” She then gave a highly 
inaccurate account of Dan’s 
fight with the knife man, and 
described how the crowd was 
hunting him down right now 
at the far end of the park. 

Dan took his change and 
said, “I’ll have to go look.” 

He stepped outside and 
could see the path of the 
crowd with no difficulty. The 
flowering shrubs were flat- 
tened, and the ground under 
the trees showed the marks of 
many feet. Dan recovered his 
mataform unit and walked a 
short distance to look down 

20 



toward the far end of the 
green, where the swimmers 
were all out of the pool — 
probably so that it could be 
searched for Dan. 

He turned around and no- 
ticed near the bookstore a 
large restaurant, built in a 
style that made him think of 
an old English tavern. Sev- 
eral men looking well con- 
tented came out. Dan realized 
he was hungry. 

He went in, and from a 
weird merry-go-round serv- 
ing apparatus got a steak in- 
distinguishable from those at 
home, and a selection of un- 
familiar side dishes that 
looked good to him, but made 
other diners nearby wince. 
Dan paid for his selection and 
sat down. 

During the meal, someone 
at a nearby table began to talk 
loudly, and someone else 
shouted, “Spacerot!” There 
was a momentary hush in the 
restaurant, and two burly 
men in white jackets quickly 
crossed to the table and spoke 
firmly to the diners. Peace was 
restored, and the two burly 
men wove back through sev- 
eral parties just leaving the 
restaurant, and separated to 
stand quietly but alertly near 
the far wall. 

As Dan ate, he thought, 
“Kielgaard!” 

“Right here.” 

“Do you make any sense 
out of what we’ve seen so 
far?” 

“I get the impression some- 
CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




thing’s about to snap, but I 
don’t know what. Or as my 
experts here tell me, 'It’s too 
early to venture an opinion.’ ” 
“That,” thought Dan, “is 
likely to be the trouble with 
this place. By the time we 
find out what’s going on, it 
will be too late to do anything 
about it. We’re going to have 
to play hunches to crack this 
one in time.” 

Kielgaard said fervently, 
“How we crack it makes no 
difference to me, so long as 
we do crack it.” 

W HILE Dan ate, a consid- 
erable crowd of people 
went out the front door, and 
two couples came in. The res- 
taurant, however, remained 
very nearly full. 

“Something tells me,” Dan 
thought, “that there must be 
a lot more to this planet than 
meets the eye.” 

He got up and walked to- 
ward the back of the restaur- 
ant. What he had taken for 
the rear wall turned out to be 
merely a wall that divided one 
section of the restaurant from 
another equally large, where 
waitresses served individual 
tables. 

A flight of carpeted steps 
led down to men’s and wo- 
men’s rest rooms and a gently 
sloping, softly lighted hall- 
way. People were coming up 
the hall in considerably great- 
er numbers than they went 
down, and Dan was startled 
to see that they reacted to him 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



exactly as the crowd outside 
had, before he had gone into 
the bookstore to watch them 
unnoticed. 

Dan went to the men’s rest 
room, washed, and inconspic- 
uously studied himself in the 
mirror. He looked very much 
different than he had before. 
Why, then, did the people re- 
act in the same way? 

Dan concealed a mataform 
unit in the dimly lit lounge 
outside the washroom, then 
went out and down the hall. 
He had gone perhaps thirty 
steps when a lithe man com- 
ing the other way saw him, 
whipped out a gun, and shout- 
ed, “Death!” 

One instant Dan was walk- 
ing down the right side of the 
hall. A split fraction of an 
instant later, he had thrown 
himself to the other side of 
the hall. 

There was a swift, bright 
flash. 

Someone screamed. 

The gun went spinning and 
Dan had the man on the floor, 
both hands locked at his 
throat. It was a severe strug- 
gle for Dan to loosen his 
hands. 

A crowd gathered so quick- 
ly that there was scarcely 
room to stand. A man carry- 
ing a small box with a handle 
forced his way through. Dan 
had his captive, half-uncon- 
scious, on his feet. Improvis- 
ing rapidly, Dan said, “I think 
that was unauthorized.” 

The man with the carrying 

21 




case said grimly, “We’ll soon 
find out.” He held the man's 
fingertips to plates in the 
case, flashed a small tube in 
his eyes, and shut the case. 
There was a loud clang. 

Two powerfully built men 
wearing armbands with 
shields stepped up. One glanc- 
ed at Dan and said, “Want to 
finish him? He's yours, by 
rights.” 

Someone in the crowd said, 
“Question him! Find out 
which side is behind this!” 

The man with the carrying 
case said sternly, “That's nei- 
ther here nor there. The only 
question is, which side is 
right?” 

There was a tense silence. 
It occurred to Dan that this 
planet might not be called 
Truth for nothing. He was 
still gripping his captive by 
the arms and wanted in the 
worst way to question him. 
But how, in this crowd? And 
then he remembered that he 
still had one mataform unit 
with him. 

The man with the case was 
saying to the sullen crowd, 
“Maybe you think something's 
wrong. Maybe it is. All right, 
you know what to do — go to 
the War Ruler — ” 

Dan mentally pronounced a 
key word, then opened his 
hands as he pronounced 
another. 

A momentary flash of dense 
jungle, and then he was in the 
corridor again, his prisoner 
gone. 



I T ALL seemed to take a 
moment to register. As 
soon as it did, someone shout- 
ed, “Spacerot!” This word 
acted on the crowd like a blaz- 
ing torch thrown into an ex- 
plosives shack. They began 
smashing each other violently 
around in the crowded cor- 
ridor. Dan barely recovered 
his mataform unit, which had 
fallen to the floor when he 
transferred his prisoner, and 
had a rough time merely stay- 
ing on his feet. The savage 
pressing and crowding in the 
jammed corridor seemed to 
drive the crowd to hysteria. 

Dan realized there was no 
way to tell when he might get 
loose. For the second time, he 
used the mataform unit to get 
out of the corridor. This time 
he went to the shelter under 
the river. He got some strong 
cord, went to the place in the 
jungle where his prisoner 
was, and tied him up. Then 
he returned to the shelter, 
fitted a set of small filters in 
his nostrils, and went back to 
the lounge outside the wash- 
room near the corridor, carry- 
ing a small egg-shaped object. 
Someone happened to be look- 
ing at the spot where he 
appeared. Dan ignored the 
staring onlooker, went out to 
the corridor, and found that 
things were even worse than 
when he had left. 

He threw the egg-shaped 
object at the wall of the corri- 
dor and ducked back into the 
lounge. 



22 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




There was a loud bang , fol- 
lowed by a number of small- 
er explosions. Abruptly the 
lounge was filled with bright 
points of light and little pop- 
ping noises. The air was per- 
meated with a gray vapor. 
The people in the room sagged 
in their seats or collapsed 
on the floor, and Dan was 
very careful to breathe only 
through the filters in his nos- 
trils. He mentally said a key 
word and he was in the corri- 
dor, standing on a mound 
of unconscious people. He 
worked till he found the 
transceiver, went by mata- 
form back to the lounge, took 
the transceiver there in case 
the lounge should be searched, 
and walked back through the 
corridor over heaps of peo- 
ple, picked up the other mata- 
form unit, and went on down 
the corridor. 

He wasn't happy about the 
people behind him. When the 
concentration of the drug in 
the air reached a low enough 
point, those on top of the heap 
were going to come to, then 
those under them, till there 
was one writhing hysterical 
mass that would be even 
worse than it had been before 
he threw the bomb. The only 
good feature — if it could be 
called that — was that they 
would all very soon be vio- 
lently nauseated, with an ur- 
gent need for fresh air, and 
yet would be too sickened and 
weak to, head for the outside 
in a rush. 



Thinking this, Dan rounded 
a corner and came to a dead 
stop. 

D IRECTLY before him was 
a short, wide, high-ceil- 
inged cross-corridor with half 
a dozen doors swinging open 
as people hurried in, walked 
a few paces, and collapsed. 
Either side of this short hall 
was made of shiny metal con- 
taining numerous slots. As 
Dan watcher, a man came 
through a door, and in one 
automatic motion jammed a 
coin in a slot, ripped off a 
ticket that popped out anoth- 
er slot, then suddenly blinked 
and jerked around to stare at 
the pile of people on the floor 
of the corridor. Then he col- 
lapsed. 

Dan glanced from this man 
to the wall above the doors, 
which was brilliant with 
lights and moving letters, 
forming a maze that made 
him dizzy to look at : 

SKL MACH OPS — 80L6h4 S 
WANTED ON LEVEL 10 
MNL LBRS-647L25h2*MN 
*MEN WITH FAST REFLE 
PENSES PAID HOUSING 

Dan strode forward and 
through a door with the num- 
eral “1” over it. — 
Directly before him was a 
short dead-end hallway that 
abruptly vanished, and he was 
walking toward a crowd of 
hurrying people in an im- 
mense room. 



A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



23 




G LANCING around, Dan 
again felt at home. The 
immense room reminded him 
of Grand Central Mataform 
Terminal back on Earth. One 
wall even had the same kind 
of huge map of the tunnels 
and cross-tunnels that gave 
underground access to stores 
in the area. But the map here 
was even larger and more 
complex. Near its face were 
spidery walks and moving 
stairways, so that people 
could examine individual 
parts from close at hand if 
they wanted. 

Dan looked over the termi- 
nal carefully, then walked 
slowly along looking for a place 
to hide one of his mataform 
units. He spotted, near a door 
in a corner, a poster on a 
stand showing a strong young 
man in uniform with a series 
of numbers, apparently dates, 
stretching out like a road be- 
fore him. The stand held a 
poster on either side, and 
there was a place between 
them where Dan could slip 
one of the mataform units. 
An instant after he did this, 
he was in the shelter under 
the river. 

Quickly, he got out a very 
light, strong two-man tent, an 
air mattress, a hypodermic, 
and a shiny half-globe with 
web straps at the back. He 
immediately went to the spot 
in the jungle where he had 
left his prisoner and found 
him thrashing furiously in an 
attempt to get loose. Dan in- 

24 



jected a small quantity of a 
fast-acting hypnotic drug, and 
the man lay still. Then Dan 
set up the small tent and got 
the man inside on the mat- 
tress. 

It was now getting dark 
outside, and, with the dark- 
ness, there was a rumble of 
thunder in the distance. Dan 
went back to the shelter, re- 
turned with a light, and ad- 
justed the half-globe over the 
man’s face and head, then 
fastened the straps behind his 
head. He inserted in the man’s 
ears two little thimblelike de- 
vices, then said mentally, 
“Kielgaard?” 

Kielgaard’s voice answered, 
“We’ll know in a minute.” Af- 
ter a considerable pause, he 
said, “Yes, he’s responding. 
Watch.” 

Very slowly, the man’s 
right arm lifted fi - om the 
mattress, then dropped limp- 
ly. 

Dan said, “You can handle 
it all from that end?” 

“Easily. We’ve got a team 
here that will do nothing else 
but question him.” 

Dan nodded, aware that 
the voices of specially train- 
ed psychologists were now 
speaking in the man’s ears, 
so that he heard nothing else, 
while he saw only what the 
screen in the half-globe pro- 
jected directly into his eyes. 
Soon he should begin to talk, 
and what he said would be 
transmitted through subspace 
to Kielgaard’s team of ques- 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




tioners. Then it might be pos- 
sible to learn something of 
what was going on on this 
planet. But there was another 
way that might also help. 

Dan glanced at his wrist- 
watch and saw that it was 
late enough so that if this 
were Earth most stores would 
probably be closed by now. 
Dan didn't know how it was 
on this planet, but he pro- 
nounced a key word and was 
in the bookstore that faced 
the green. The bookstore was 
closed. 

Dan quickly selected an 
armload of books, brought 
them back to the shelter un- 
der the river, went back and 
got another stack of them. He 
set up a spidery device of 
light metal and piled the 
books near enough so the 
feed arms could reach them. 
A set of rubber-tipped rods 
like long skeletal fingers turn- 
ed the pages, while the scanner 
on an overhead arm oscillated 
from a position over one page 
to a position over the other 
page. 

Dan said, “How's it coming 
in, Kielgaard?” 

“Speed it up a little." 

Dan moved a small lever. 
The pages turned more 
quickly. 

D AN said, “We'll see how 
the feeder works before 
I leave it." Then he got out 
a mirror and went to work 
to change his appearance 
again. 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



The second book fed in 
with no difficulty, so Dan took 
four of his little mataform 
units, which was all he had 
room for, and went back to 
the terminal. 

The crowd seemed to have 
thinned out somewhat, so he 
supposed the evening rush 
was about over. As in termi- 
nals nearly everywhere Dan 
had been, most of the people 
moved briskly, intent on their 
own affairs. No one paid much 
attention to Dan while he 
glanced around, noting the 
wall of flashing lights and 
moving letters, similar to but 
far larger than the one he 
had seen before, and a series 
of sizable blocky structures 
with large numerals suspend- 
ed above them, and the styl- 
ized outlines of doorways on 
their four walls. People ap- 
peared in front of these door- 
ways, or strolled directly 
toward them and vanished, 
hesitating only when a red 
glow outlined the door to show 
that someone was coming 
through from the other side. 

In the center of the room 
toward either end were large 
silvery structures with the 
word “Information" hanging 
above them. Dan went to one 
and found that vertical blue 
lines divided it into twenty- 
four sections, with room left 
over for more that weren't 
there as yet, plus a section 
headed “General Informa- 
tion." 

Dan studied the numerous 

25 




slots, went to the General In- 
formation section and spent 
most of his change. He sat 
down with a small package 
of maps and folders and soon 
had before him a cross-sec- 
tional drawing showing a se- 
ries of spherical layers one in- 
side the other, labeled, “Level 
1 — Retail,” “Level 2 — Retail,” 
“Level 3 — Wholesale,” “Level 
4 — Manufacturing,” and so 
on, numbered from the out- 
side in toward the center of 
the sphere, from one to twen- 
ty-five. 

Dan sat perfectly still for 
a moment, looking at this. He 
leafed carefully though the 
folders, and was soon convinc- 
ed that this wasn’t a map of 
underground layers under 
just one city, but of an inter- 
connected system that appear- 
ed to stretch over most of the 
planet. The surface was la- 
beled, “Recreation — Ordeals 
— General.” 

The complex of under- 
ground layers seemed to be 
much thicker than separate 
floors of a building would be ; 
the map showed cross-sections 
of buildings of many stories 
in the individual layers. 

Dan studied the map furth- 
er and found that Level 10 
was marked, “Coordination — 
Government.” Dan walked to 
the information machine and 
came back with a general map 
of Level 10, which was divided 
into sixteen sections. Sections 
4 and 5 were headed “Govern- 
ment Sections,” and Dan got 



large-scale maps of each of 
them. 

What he was looking at 
was being reproduced far 
away on big screens, and in- 
stantly recorded, to be exam- 
ined in detail by staffs of 
trained men. He was thank- 
ful this was so. The map was 
a maze of colored lines, blocks, 
and curves, with numbered 
lists up and down both sides 
and across the bottom. 

Abruptly, Kielgaard’s voice 
said, “Dan, see that dai*k pur- 
ple oval a little to the left of 
the center of the page?” 

“I see it.” Dan glanced 
from the number to the list 
at the side of the page and 
read, “War Ruler’s Control 
Center.” 

K IELGAARD said, “The 
staff going over those 
books thinks there is some 
sort of an arrangement by 
which a ‘war ruler’ takes over 
absolute power in an emer- 
gency. What would be a better 
way to take over the planet 
than to get control of this 
War Ruler and then provoke 
an emergency?” 

Dan studied the purple oval 
on the map. “Yes. But what 
do we do about it?” 

“The first of your rein- 
forcements will be coming 
down tonight. If you can get 
near that control center and 
plant a few transceivers, we 
might be able to make a good 
deal of trouble for anyone 
who may have seized it.”

“I’ll do my best,” said Dan. 
He got up, put most of the 
maps and folders into a lock- 
er, and bought a ticket for 
Level 10, Section 4. As he 
turned, he noticed two men 
standing about twenty feet 
away, talking. On impulse, 
Dan went, not to the block 
that would take him to Level 
10, but instead toward the 
station that his pamphlet had 
told him would take him to 
Section 6 of the same level he 
was on. As he rounded a cor- 
ner and strode up a deserted 
corridor, he stooped and slid 
a mataform unit into the 
space between a waste con- 
tainer and the wall. 

An instant later, he was 
back beside the posters where 
he had hidden a transceiver 
earlier. 

Two men were walking in 
the same direction he had 
gone. 

Dan followed them till they 
vanished, walking very rapid- 
ly now, around another cor- 
ner. 

He picked up the mata- 
form transceiver and looked 
around for the blocky struc- 
ture with the big number 
“10” over it. He saw it, after 
a moment, near the wall with 
the lights and moving letters 
on it. 

“Kielgaard,” he thought, 
“what do you suppose that 
wall is?” 

"We think it’s a sort of ab- 
breviated classified ad ar- 
rangement.” 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



“Sounds reasonable,” Dan 
thought. 

Dan was by now near the 
blocky structure with the big 
numeral “10” above it. Each 
of the four faces of the struc- 
ture had four large doors out- 
lined on it — one door for each 
of the sixteen sections of the 
level. Dan stepped up to the 
door marked “4” and it was 
immediately outlined in red. 
A voice said, “Travelers are 
reminded of the special re- 
strictions now enforced at the 
governmental sections. To en- 
ter, you must present valid 
authorization papers, or state 
an acceptable reason for en- 
tering.” 

Dan stood perfectly still. 
He was fairly sure now that 
he must get into this section. 
But how? 

At that moment, the lights 
of the huge wall of moving 
letters caught his attention, 
and Kielgaard’s voice said, 
“Dan, look to the left, about 
halfway up.” 

Dan looked and saw moving 
letters spell out : 

S WANTED ON LEVEL 10 

ALL CREDITS PAID SH 

ORT TERM EMPLOYMENT 

*MEN WITH FAST REFLEXE 

S WANTED ON LEVEL 10 

D AN realized he had seen 
parts of this ad spelled out 
twice at the terminal en- 
trance. He didn’t know if it 
was a trap or something he 
could use. He said, “I’m in- 

27 




terested in a job on Level 10.” 
“You have examined the 
record ?” 

Dan had no idea what this 
meant. He said, “I under- 
stand men with fast reflexes 
are wanted on Level 10.” 
“One moment.” 

There was a short pause, 
then a new voice. “What we 
offer you is a special credit 
allotment sufficient for all 
normal mating and purchase 
needs. On account of these 
latest restrictions, I can't tell 
you exactly what the job is, 
but I can say this: The re- 
wards are great. But you also 
might end up getting sprin- 
kled over the forest. We've 
got a situation down here 
that has to be cleaned up fast. 
With the special referendum 
tomorrow, it might boil over 
and make an interstellar 
mess. We want you for a 
night's work. At the end 
you're either rich or dead. 
How abQut it?” 

Dan thought of the two 
words “interstellar mess,” 
used in connection with a 
“special referendum.” He had 
the sensation that he was 
getting close. 

“All right,” he said. 

T HERE was a blur as 
mataform stations shut- 
tled him from one place to the 
next. Then he was walking 
into a large room holding 
about thirty men, all of whom 
had something of the look of 
big cats alert for prey. 

28 



Dan had hardly come in 
when a lithe man walked out 
on a raised platform, looked 
over the waiting men, and 
said, “I'd like to wait till there 
are more of us, but there isn't 
time. I'll come to the point 
without delay. I'll only ex- 
plain it once, so listen care- 
fully. 

“On this level, we have the 
War Ruler's control center. 
Two levels up, there is the 
planetary zoo. Among the 
animals in the zoo is an ape 
about our size and general 
shape, with a thick layer of 
fur, strong muscles, and a 
sense of humor like a white- 
hot rivet dropped down your 
collar. By some process I 
don't understand, about fifty 
of these apes have gotten into 
a storeroom in an arms depot 
attached to the control center. 

“With this referendum 
coming up to decide whether 
we should join the Stellar 
Union, every time there is a 
disturbance the election com- 
mittee blames it on one faction 
or another. Using their emer- 
gency powers, they then clap 
on some new restriction to 
keep order till the referendum 
is over. If there is now a 
disturbance near the control 
center itself, tempers are go- 
ing to shorten further. If the 
blame should be stuck on one 
side or the other, true or un- 
true, it could swing the vote 
either way. 

“We have got to get those 
apes out of the arms depot 

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




right away. The trouble is, 
there's an alarm in the arms 
depot that can't be shut off 
except from the control cen- 
ter. Fire any kind of impact 
or vibration weapon in there, 
or change the composition of 
the atmosphere by pouring in 
gas, and the alarm automatic- 
ally goes off in guard stations 
all over this level. If we had 
more time, we could starve 
them out. We don’t have the 
time. 

“The result is that we have 
to go after them with knives 
and clubs. Now, the apes are 
fast, they gang up, they throw 
things, and if they can, they’ll 
grab you from opposite sides 
and pull your arms and legs 
off. That's very funny — for 
them. So we'll have to work 
together as a team and fight 
as hard as we know how." 

A FTER the speaker finish- 
ed, there was a silence in 
the room. Dan was thinking 
over the idea and he liked 
nothing about it. He had lit- 
tle enough time to do his job, 
and he did not want to spend 
it being pulled to pieces by 
apes. He called out, “Mind if 
I make a suggestion?" 

“I'm willing to try any- 
thing. Let's hear it." 

Dan said, “I don't know 
about anybody else here, but 
I am no team player myself. 
Let me go in alone first. You 
wait half an hour and then 
come in and see if there are 
fifty apes left." 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



Everyone craned to see who 
was offering to fight fifty wild 
apes singlehanded. 

The man on the platform 
turned pale, but said, 
“Agreed. And if you win, you 
received the combined credits 
of all." 

Dan found himself walking 
down a corridor, surrounded 
by well-wishers, to a room 
where several tables were 
loaded with hand-weapons. 
He picked up a short weight- 
ed club, and a short double- 
edge, razor-sharp sword. A 
few minutes later, he arrived 
at a heavy metal door studded 
with rivets and painted green. 

Dan had intended to hide a 
transceiver nearby on the out- 
side and spend as little time 
in the storeroom as possible. 
But everything had happened 
so fast, and there were so 
many eyes watching him, that 
he had no chance to hide a 
mataform unit anywhere. 

There was a loud clang as 
the heavy door swung shut 
behind him. Then he was in 
a big dimly lighted room with 
a twelve-foot aisle running 
down the center, a narrower 
aisle along each wall, and high 
piles of wooden crates and 
wirebound heavy cardboard 
cartons spaced five feet apart 
to either side of the central 
aisle. There was a strong 
smell of damp dirty fur. On 
the floor partway up the aisle 
lay what looked like a clothed 
human arm. 

From the far end of the 

29 




building came a series of low 
gruff barks. A humping mo- 
tion ran along like a wave up 
the aisle and over the piles of 
crates toward Dan. 

He glanced briefly to either 
side at the solid concrete walls 
of the building, felt behind 
him. The door was locked. 

It flashed through his mind 
that up till now he had had 
good luck on this planet. 

Dan saw, in the nearest 
corner of the room, several 
pipes that ran up from the 
floor and were bent to travel 
along near the ceiling. He 
quickly slipped a mataform 
unit behind these pipes on the 
floor, then cut into a card- 
board carton about fifteen feet 
away and put another unit 
inside. He tossed a third on 
top of the nearest pile of car- 
tons, mentally said a key 
word, and was on the pile 
slashing open a carton to slide 
the unit inside. Then he was 
on the floor in the corner. 

In the dim light, the shad- 
owy figures came toward 
him. Their long arms swung 
up and a barrage of rifle 
parts, bayonets, scabbards, 
and helmets smashed into the 
corner. Dan was fifteen feet 
away when they hit. An in- 
stant later, he was back, kick- 
ing the rubble out of the cor- 
ner. There was a repeated 
gruff cough, then the aisles 
were jammed, and he had a 
brief view of bared teeth in 
fur-covered faces, and hairy 
arms that reached out to 



grasp him. There was a grisly 
laugh that started as a low 
chuckle and ended on a high- 
pitched wavering note. 

Dan mentally pronounced a 
key word and he was on the 
pile of cartons with a half a 
dozen apes. The short sword 
flicked out and back. Other 
apes sprang from the next 
pile of cartons. Dan dropped 
the weighted club, threw his 
last mataform unit toward the 
top of a pile across the aisle, 
and an instant later had re- 
covered it, dropped to the 
floor, and raced up the aisle. 

T HERE was noise like teeth 
clicking together and then 
the wavering laugh burst out 
again as the apes turned to 
chase him up the aisle. Dan 
slid the transceiver into a slit- 
open carton and whirled as 
the leaders rushed toward 
him. The short sword flashed 
out and back in rapid thrusts, 
and abruptly Dan was on top 
of the first pile of cartons. He 
recovered the weighted club, 
glanced down at the apes 
turning to rush up the aisles, 
and then suddenly he was 
with them, slamming the last 
few of them over the heads 
with the weighted club. 

He thrust, stabbed, and 
smashed, now in one place, 
now another, always striking 
the gibbering horde where 
they were fewest and most 
off-balance. 

After a long, hideous inter- 
val, there came a silence. Dan 



30 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




could see that there were four 
heaps of dead or unconscious 
apes, the only live ones were 
a few clinging to overhead 
beams with their eyes shut. 

Dan recovered his trans- 
ceivers and made his way to 
one of the few windows in the 
room. This was about seven 
feet from the floor, heavily 
barred, with its glass panes 
broken out. Dan pulled him- 
self up and looked out at a 
walk and a high wall a few 
feet away. He cut the sleeve 
of his shirt into strips and 
knotted the strips together 
with a transceiver tied onto 
either end, so that one trans- 
ceiver hung on the outside 
and the other on the inside. 

Then Dan was outside, in 
an underground part of the 
planet where no one was sup- 
posed to be without an official 
permit. 

The air seemed as fresh as 
outdoors, while overhead 
there was the appearance of 
the sky on a heavily overcast 
day. There was light enough 
to see by, but it was appar- 
ently dimmed to provide an 
artificial night. 

Dan saw no one, and said 
mentally, “Kielgaard?” 
Kielgaard’s voice had a 
hoarse sound. “Are you out 
of that place?” 

‘Tm out of it — thank 
heaven.” 

“Amen. But listen, things 
have taken a nasty turn.” 
“What's happened?” 

“We've questioned that 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



prisoner. The outfit behind 
this trouble is Trans-Space. 
But they don't have the con- 
trol center. Instead, they've 
got the headquarters of the 
election committee that con- 
trols the referendum. Trans- 
Space is representing itself as 
the government of an inter- 
stellar league of planets. They 
have everything set up to fal- 
sify the vote tomorrow.” 

Dan frowned. “What of it? 
I can still plant the mataform 
transceivers and we can bring 
men down from above.” 

“Yes, but Trans-Space has 
a mataform terminal set up 
in the terminal election head- 
quarters. It hooks into the 
local system and connects 
with an outpost in the jungle 
on the surface. Trans-Space 
has been building up to this 
day for over three years. The 
election headquarters is 
manned like a fortress. It’s 
in immediate touch with the 
outpost on the surface where 
they've got an army of rein- 
forcements.” 

Dan stood still, thinking. 
He remembered the official 
with the carrying case in the 
corridor overhead, who had 
said to the angry crowd, “Go 
to the War Ruler.” Dan men- 
tioned the incident and said, 
“What about this War Ruler 
and his emergency powers?” 

K ielgaard said, “it 

looked promising to us at 
first, but actually that's as if 
someone should say, ‘England 

31 




is in peril. Go to King Ar- 
thur/ ” 

“What?” said Dan, puz- 
zled. 

“The War Ruler is a myth. 
A thousand years or more 
ago, after a terrific internal 
war, they had a famine. They 
also had a huge army to dis- 
band, headed by a very pop- 
ular leader. The army appar- 
ently threatened to take over 
the planet, but by a clever 
gimmick, the government put 
off the crisis. They announced 
that their scientists had dis- 
covered a way to halt the flow 
of time after the famine — and 
the War Ruler marched the 
whole army loyally into a 
kind of big mausoleum where 
they presumably killed the lot 
of them with a quick-acting 
gas. That is the War Ruler's 
Control Center. 

“Ever since then, they've 
been making ritual gestures. 
They stock new arms of 
standard design nearby, and 
recruit a number of fresh sol- 
diers to join the old — as a 
population control measure. 
To make the illusion complete, 
they say that any man or wo- 
man who sincerely believes 
the state to be in peril can 
enter the control center, by 
passing through a lethal field 
that kills the insincere and 
lets the sincere through alive. 
A number of people have 
tried it and got killed, so now 
they don't try any more." 

“Where is this place?" 
asked Dan. 

32 



“If we read your map right- 
ly, that wall in front of you 
marks the edge of the field 
surrounding it." 

Dan set down one of the 
mataform units and mentally 
pronounced a keyword. 

He was in the shelter under 
the river. 

An instant later he was 
back by the wall, a glider and 
the control helmet in his 
hands. He clipped a trans- 
ceiver to the glider and guided 
it toward a huge, dark-stained 
building with the look of a 
fortress. He sent the glider 
around to the front of the 
building and saw two huge 
bronze doors, one of which 
stood open. There was a total- 
ly still, motionless look about 
the place that Dan did not 
care for. But the glider had 
come to a closed inner door 
and that was as far as it 
could go. Dan took off the 
control helmet, drew a deep 
breath and said a key word. 

He was standing in the 
huge hall, before the closed 
door. He opened the door. 

Before him was a room 
with tall slit windows, and as 
Dan went in, he could see 
dimly, but, like a man in a 
hall of mirrors, what he saw 
did not make sense. 

Distorted shapes and forms, 
with bright points and blots 
of light, shifted as he moved, 
and shifted again as he moved 
closer, to see one leg of what 
looked like a very old, faded 
table. A heavy cable ran up 



CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




the leg to the top, where there 
was a switch, and a bronze 
plate with the words, “Open 
Switch.” 

Dan reached for the switch, 
and hesitated. If Kielgaard’s 
theory was right, he would 
now be electrocuted, or other- 
wise disposed of. 

He swallowed hard, reached 
the rest of the way, and open- 
ed the switch. 

A pall of choking dust 
spread over the room, with 
the sound of coughing all 
around him and the rustle of 
clothing and stamping of feet. 

Dan wiped his streaming 
eyes, and saw a man in uni- 
form behind the desk, all but 
one corner of which looked 
new. 

The man stared at Dan and 
said, “So soon? What’s hap- 
pened?” 

D AN glanced around. The 
huge room was filled with 
tough, weary-looking men in 
combat uniform, all fully 
armed and equipped. H e 
thought fast, turned back to 
the man behind the desk and 
said earnestly, “Peace is re- 
stored to the planet. It’s been 
rebuilt and the damage is all 
repaired. But now, fantastic 
as it may seem, an enemy has 
come down to this world from 
outer space — ” 

The man at the desk angrily 
brought down his fist.“No one 
lives in outer space! That’s 
foolishness!” 

Dan said, his mind racing, 
A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



“Whoever they are, they’ve 
seized a vital communications 
center! They’ve got men on 
guard, armed to the teeth. 
They’ve issued orders through 
captive government officials to 
seal off this part of the level 
from the public. They’re try- 
ing to take over the whole 
government!” 

There was a stir in the 
room and a low ugly rumble. 

“I knew it,” said the man 
behind the desk, jumping to 
his feet. “I knew they’d lie 
low and then creep back again 
when things are quiet. If we’d 
been demobilized, it would all 
have been for nothing. But we 
aren’t demobilized!” 

Abruptly there were shout- 
ed orders, and someone was 
gripping Dan by the arm. 
“Just lead the way. Show us 
where they are and we’ll take 
care of the rest.” 

Dan said mentally, “Kiel- 
gaard?” 

Kielgaard said, “Good 
Lord ! Go straight outside and 
turn right.” 

Someone threw a switch be- 
side the door. Outside, they 
followed Dan to the right. Be- 
hind him, Dan heard the mut- 
ter and cough of engines start- 
ing up. They were in a well- 
lighted street like that of a 
large city, but there was no 
traffic, either because it was 
late or because of the travel 
restrictions. 

Kielgaard said, “Next left 
and it’s in front of you.” 

Dan turned the corner. Di- 

33 




rectly before him was a large 
white marble building with a 
lawn on either side of a broad 
flight of steps, and guards on 
the sidewalk, the steps, and 
in emplacements in the shrub- 
bery on either side of the 
steps. 

One of them saw Dan and 
casually snapped a shot at 
him. Dan got back around the 
corner fast and looked around. 
On both sides of the street, 
men were lying flat at the 
bases of the buildings, or 
crouching in doorways. Down 
the street, they were running 
up a block to the left. Up the 
middle of the street came a 
tank. It paused just out of 
sight from the building 
around the corner, and an 
amplified voice boomed out, 
‘This is the War Ruler. Get 
out of that building before the 
count of thirty, or we clean 
you out.” 

A voice began to count. 
There was a sound of fast 
footsteps on the sidewalk 
around the corner, and half 
a dozen men carrying guns 
came into view. Dan recog- 
nized some of the men who 
had searched the place where 
he’d landed his boat. One of 
them, not yet quite in a posi- 
tion to see the tank, called out 
irritably, “All right, you. Get 
out here!” 

Then he caught sight of the 
men lying at the base of the 
buildings, and crouched in the 
doorways. He fired. 

Flashes of light came from 



the men by the buildings. 
There was a roar and a grind 
and the tank rolled forward. 
A whistle blew. Dan heaved 
a mataform transceiver to- 
ward the emplacement at the 
base of the stairs, and an in- 
stant before it landed, he 
mentally pronounced a key 
word. 

In the emplacement, he 
jerked the men away from 
their gun before they could 
fire a shot. He knocked them 
senseless, grabbed a rifle, and 
sprang up onto the staircase, 
with the intent of sprinting to 
the other side and diving into 
the emplacement there. Half- 
way across the steps, there 
was a sensation as if someone 
had smacked him between the 
shoulder blades with a rifle 
butt. He saw the stairs com- 
ing up to meet him, and then 
he saw nothing. 

H E CAME to with a pretty 
face smiling at him 
through a sort of fog. The 
fog cleared away, and a 
highly attractive nurse was 
looking at him very admir- 
ingly. She said, “Sir, you 
have a visitor.” 

Dan glanced around and 
saw Kielgaard, a sorrowful 
look on his face. 

Dan said as the nurse went 
out, “She spoke Truthian, 
didn’t she?” 

“She did. You’re still on the 
planet.” 

“What’s this ‘sir’ business 
and the pleasant smile for?”

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




Kielgaard said. “You’re a 
hero. It shows, incidentally, 
how the best experts can 
make awe-inspiring mistakes. 
We gave you fast reflexes, 
thinking that would make you 
safer. But it turns out that 
the planet has a class of auth- 
orized assassins who hunt 
down criminals for a liveli- 
hood, and never get too num- 
erous because they fight each 
other for extra credits and 
prestige. With your fast re- 
flexes and built-in wariness, 
the populace immediately 
spotted you for one of these 
lawful assassins, so you 
couldn’t have been more con- 
spicuous.” 

Kielgaard shook his head. 
“Meanwhile, Trans-Space was 
bringing in hired killers to 
knock off the planet's lawful 
assassins at a huge bonus per 
head, in order to create an up- 
roar so that the election 
committee, which they had 
already captured and condi- 
tioned, would clap on more re- 
strictions, thus creating more 
tension, so that Trans-Space 
could swing the referendum 
at the last minute. You see, 
the most dangerous thing we 
could have done to you was 
to give you these extra-fast 
reflexes. But now, because of 
it, you’re a hero.” Kielgaard 
looked sad. 

“Luckily,” said Dan, “I’m 
still alive. And so were all 
those soldiers.” 

“Another mistake of the ex- 
perts,” said Kielgaard. “The 

A TOURIST NAMED DEATH 



highest authorities on Truth 
strongly suspected something 
was wrong with the protec- 
tive field around the control 
center. This made them fear- 
ful that the scientific device 
to halt the flow of time hadn’t 
worked either. This would 
have been a terrible catas- 
trophe, so by a set of ration- 
alizations that would do credit 
to a bunch of habitual liars, 
they evaded the whole issue. 
The experts and I made the 
mistake of drawing the logical 
conclusion. I’m glad it wasn't 
so.” 

“What happened to Trans- 
Space?” 

Kielgaard stopped looking 
sad and smiled a smile of deep 
satisfaction. “Galactic has its 
contract with this planet. 
Trans-Space is in a very 
anemic condition. The Truth- 
ians don’t like people who lie, 
and they always settle their 
accounts very strictly.” 

Kielgaard’s face subsided 
into its gloomy look. 

Dan said, “What’s wrong?” 

“Well,” said Kielgaard, 
“you see, you’re a planetary 
hero for settling that business 
with Trans-Space. Also, you 
have — let’s see” — he took 
out a slip of paper — “the 
equivalent of around six 
hundred thousand dollars 
spending money for cleaning 
out those apes, plus — I don’t 
know how to translate this — 
six thousand mating credits. 
They have a weird system for 
romance, and these credits — ” 

35 




Dan grinned. “Envious?” 

“It isn’t that,” said Kiel- 
gaard. “I’m thinking how I’d 
feel in your place. These 
Truthians don’t have any 
give in their system. Right’s 
right, and wrong’s wrong, and 
they hand out rewards and 
punishments irrespective of 
persons.” 

There was a sharp rap at 
the door. 

Dan tried to sit up, but he 
was still too weak. 

Kielgaard said sadly, “I 
tried to reason with them, but 
I might as well have talked to 
a wall.” 

“Listen,” said Dan, be- 
coming alarmed. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“I don’t have the heart to 
tell you,” said Kielgaard. 

P ICKING up a large brief- 
case, he said, “Do what 
you think best. I might men- 
tion that we’re giving you a 
bonus, though I suppose that’s 
no consolation.” 

The rap at the door was 
repeated and there were 
sounds of arguments outside. 

“What’s in that briefcase?” 
said Dan. 

“A big version of the kind 
of mataform transceiver you 
used. There’s a dreadnaught 
of ours orbiting the planet 
with another transceiver like 
this on board. The key word, 



in case you should have use 
for it, is ‘Krakior.’ ” 

The door burst open and 
three men came in, arguing 
with a man in a white jacket. 

“That doesn’t matter,” said 
the first man, a familiar-look- 
ing individual who was open- 
ing a square case with carry- 
ing handle. “The only question 

is, was it or was it not an 
unauthorized kill, and is this 
the man? We have our check- 
er set up to answer this ques- 
tion and that’s all there is to 

it. ” He glanced at Dan. “Hold 
out your fingertips, please, 
and touch those plates. Purely 
a routine check.” 

Behind the man with the 
case were two men with arm- 
bands and shields. One 
glanced disinterestedly at Dan 
and cocked his gun. 

Dan looked at the head of 
A Section and said fervently, 
“Thank you, Kielgaard.” 

The doctor in the white 
jacket was arguing to no vis- 
ible effect as the tube was held 
to Dan’s eyes, snapped back 
into the case, and the case 
clapped shut, to give its loud 
alarm clang. 

The assassin with the gun 
calmly leveled it at Dan and 
fired. 

All he hit was a suddenly 
empty bed. 

Dan had said the key word.

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 




Thirty Degrees 

Cattywonkus 

By JAMES BELL 



It doesn't take a heap 
of leaving to make any 
house a nightmare. One 
vanishing door will do 



nastily. 



I T WAS a tremendous house. 

And they were newlyweds. 
And were still a mite flighty. 
And for a while that accounted 
for the whole thing. 

At tbs moment, it seemed to 
Ernie Lane that in a house 
which even the real estate 
agent said had “either” eleven 
or twelve rooms, it was quite 
conceivable that lie and Meli- 
nee had overlooked that extra 
room. 

After all, they had only been 



living at 1312 Cedar Lane for 
four days and had hardly had 
time to make a complete survey 
of the place. 

Now it was quite different. 
For Ernie Lane had stopped 
walking hurriedly past that 
extra door, had stopped giving 
it only casual curiosity, had 
even stopped wondering after- 
ward. 

This night he had come 
home a bit tired, gone directly 
to greet his loving wife, and 



37 




then decided to put a stop to 
the gnawing question. 

While Melinee fried the 
chicken, Ernie walked careful- 
ly and wordlessly to the dim 
hallway. He went past the 
staircase, past the telephone, to 
the darkest spot between the 
living room and the study. He 
stood for a strange moment — 
there was no extra door. 

He felt the refinished wall, 
his fingertips searching for 
hidden panels. There was none. 

“Supper’s ready,” Melinee 
called. “Ernie?” 

But it had been there last 
night, the night before, the 
night before that, and the very 
first night the real estate agent 
brought them over. In fact, he 
recalled, that was the reason 
the agent had been uncertain 
about the number of rooms. 
And why had he passed it off 
as a joke, simply turning from 
the extra door without opening 
it? 

Ernie felt again. 

It was ceasing to be a joke. 
He was not a man of hallucina- 
tions. He was not a victim of 
superstition, fear or near- 
sightedness. He only wanted 
to know why he saw a door 
one day and didn’t see it the 
next. 

He called a comforting 
word to his wife, then reached 
for the telephone book. He 
found the name of Hartley 
and Hartley, Real Estate. 
PLaza 0-6633. Without any 
undue commotion, he dialed, 
in a moment, a woman’s voice 

38 



at the other end seemed to 
barge into his life. 

“Special operator. Number, 
please?” 

“PLaza 0-6633.” 

“Sorry, sir, we have no such 
number — ” 

Ernie let a disgruntled 
voice thunder into the phone: 
“Then what the heck is Hart- 
ley and Hartley Realty doing 
with it?” 

A pause. Then she replied, 
“Sir, we have no Hartley and 
Hartley — ” 

“Don’t be silly,” he said. “I 
just found it in the phone 
book.” 

She answered, “We have a 
Hartfield and Hatley, Real- 
tors, Inc., sir, but no Hartley 
and Hartley. Their number is 
in the directory.” 

Melinee was standing be- 
hind him. “Who are you call- 
ing?” 

He was shaken, but he man- 
aged to appear calm as he 
hung up. He even relaxed 
against the wall. “I was try- 
ing to get the real estate 
agent on the phone — these 
lights ought to be brighter — 
and I thought he could refer 
us to his electrician.” 

“His what?” Melinee asked. 

“Elec — ” He halted. “Never 
mind, honey. I’m beat — rough 
day. I need fried chicken.” He 
hugged his trim, prim wife 
and they walked toward the 
kitchen arm in arm. But it 
was not until they settled at 
the table that he saw, under 
the bright electric light, that 

JAMES BELL 




her hair was red, not blonde, 
and he immediately felt he'd 
been gypped. 

Her smirky little voice add- 
ed to the shock. “Darling, 
don't call me Melinee when 
my name is Marsha. It just 
isn't done." 

O N PURPOSE, Ernie spent 
an uneventful evening, 
arose the next morning, ig- 
nored his wife's red hair, con- 
veniently forgot her name, 
avoided even checking to see 
if the door was there, and 
saved up a sneer for the tele- 
phone. 

During the day, his business 
life was perfect. He got the 
Jenkins account, lunched with 
the boss, and was asked to 
serve on the membership com- 
mittee in the Chamber of 
Commerce drive. However, 
during the afternoon he devel- 
oped a terrific headache and 
excused himself from the of- 
fice long enough to see the 
company physician. 

The thin, foxy doctor hand- 
ed him a pill and a glass of 
water. After Ernie had swal- 
lowed the pill politely, the 
physician leaned forward and 
gazed at his eyes and fore- 
head. “Tell me, Lane — you're 
a newlywed, aren't you?" 
Ernie nodded. 

“Then why the worried 
frown? You seem to be carry- 
ing the Rock of Gibraltar on 
your shoulders. Is your job 
too much for you?" 

“Of course not," Ernie said, 

THIRTY DEGREES CATTYWONKUS 



smiling. “I told you I had a 
headache." 

“Perhaps," the doctor said, 
smiling back. “You seemed to 
have been in something of a 
prepossessed state when you 
came in. I was just curious." 

Ernie laughed it off and at 
the doctor's request lay on a 
cot for a period of ten min- 
utes. When he returned to the 
office, there was a request that 
he call a “Marsha." 

The sudden venomous 
thoughts of the evening be- 
fore spun before his eyes. 
What the devil was going on 
with the woman? The new 
name, the new hair-do, the 
new smirk in her voice — that 
wasn't the woman he married. 
He grabbed the phone and 
called home. 

Twenty rings. No answer. 

It was a quarter of four 
when the switchboard notified 
him that his wife was on the 
line. “Hello, Ernie? This is 
Melinee. I'm at the Lee Hat 
Shop. Can you meet me in 
half an hour? I want to do 
some shopping and I thought 
we'd have supper and maybe 
see a movie." 

Melinee? It was all like a 
breath of spring. Away from 
that house, she was a different 
person. Happily, he agreed to 
buying her a. new hat, supper 
and a ticket to Loew's State. 
For Melinee, anything. For 
Marsha, nothing. 

And when they met, surely 
enough her hair was blonde 
again and the smirk in her 

3 ? 




voice was gone. She was his 
bride, and he forgot whatever 
the past, present or future 
might hold. 

The future, however, was 
not long coming. After the 
movie, they returned home 
and were about to settle down 
when, passing along the hall- 
way, Ernie looked over his 
shoulder and saw the extra 
door. Quickly, he reached past 
Melinee and grasped the knob 
with his hand. 

“Ernie, what on Earth!” 

She startled him. He laugh- 
ed, and they went in to bed. 

It was around one a.m. 
when Ernie decided he would 
not be able to put off any 
longer the chore of exploring 
that hall door. It plainly had 
not been there the night be- 
fore; it plainly was there to- 
night. 

He tiptoed softly from bed 
and left the room. Melinee did 
not even stir. He closed the 
door lightly and cat-footed his 
way through the darkness to 
the wall switch at the foot of 
the stairs. 

# Stealthily looking all about 
him, as if someone or some- 
thing might suddenly try to 
stop him, Ernie sneaked up on 
the door. He grabbed the knob 
with both hands, turned it 
briskly and the door swung 
open. 

The pale green wall of the 
hallway confronted him. It 
was as if the door were mere- 
ly hinged onto the wall. No 
opening whatever. 



H E TAPPED it with his 
knuckles. Then he exam- 
ined the door. It was a French 
style thing extending from 
floor to ceiling with contrast- 
ing green slats. Identical with 
those appearing all along the 
hallways, most of them closet 
doors. 

Just for the heck of it, he 
thought he would drag out 
a hammer and uncork the 
screws holding the false door 
— carry it to some conspicu- 
ous place and observe as it 
went through its next disap- 
pearing act. But as he turned 
to head for the tool cabinet, 
Ernie heard the din of distant 
shouting — as if a room-full of 
men were playing cards. 

And yet not so distant. For 
a moment the world became 
silent. Ernie pressed an ear 
against the wall behind the 
false doorway. It seemed to be 
coming from inside, and there 
were only a few words of any 
audible clarity. “Maximum — 
not much longer — and loga- 
rithms — ” 

Ernie tried the adjacent 
door. It opened into a small 
storage room, unlighted. He 
felt around the wall paneling, 
but no switch. Gauging the 
dimensions, it seemed to him 
that the storage room practi- 
cally accounted for all the 
space behind the hall. If the 
fake door opened onto a room, 
it could only be this room, and 
there was nothing here. 

He listened. No sound in- 
side the confines of the room. 



40 



JAMES BELL 




But the moment he returned, 
pressed his ear against the 
outer wall, Ernie heard them 
shouting again. It was as if 
the wall were twelve inches 
thick — as if he were not hear- 
ing anything at all — and yet 
hearing. 

The thought struck him — 
there was a laundry chute 
opening from the second floor 
to the storage room. Provided 
they wanted to install a chute. 
Meanwhile, the agent had told 
him, it would remain just a 
hole in the floor. 

He and Melinee had not 
made any plans for develop- 
ing the second floor. It was 
evident that his mother would 
one day have to live with 
them, and her own invalid 
sister, in time. And then 
whatever children there 
might be. But so far he and 
Melinee had actually made 
only one trip up there with the 
agent. 

In fact, there was no elec- 
trical connection to the up- 
stairs whatever. Ernie re- 
membered the layout, how- 
ever, and made his way up the 
stairs that creaked in defiance 
of the agent’s compliments. 
When he reached the top in 
the pitch blackness, he felt for 
the wall. 

A strange coldness not at 
all common to the summer 
season moved out along the 
hallway. It seemed to hover 
around him, curious of the 
intruder. 

Imagination. 

THIRTY DEGREES CATTYWONKUS 



He walked on, an inch at a 
time, for he remembered a 
small table about half way 
along. But he never felt the 
table. Ernie reached the end 
of the hall before he was sure 
— and where had the table 
gone ? 

He returned along the op- 
posite wall until he felt the 
small square paneling. Then 
a brass knob. He pulled it 
open, half expecting the end 
of the world. And at that 
point, a bluish haze filled with 
gaseous, luminous smoke rose 
out and blinded him. 

When the obnoxious odor 
of the smoke was gone, he 
took a deep breath and stuck 
his head in again. Directly be- 
low him sat three men, fat 
and jovial, shaking their pipes 
at one another. There was a 
row of red and white lighted 
tubes, not unlike fluorescents, 
a mahoganylike counter that 
might pass for a bar, and a 
row of bottles against a mir- 
ror. 

T HE dimensions immediate- 
ly struck Ernie as all 
wrong. It was far bigger than 
the hall closet where it was 
supposed to be. In fact, the 
portion he saw seemed to be 
the focal point of a large 
dance hall or bar room. But 
the most obvious quality of 
the scene was the tilted floor. 
The whole thing seemed to be 
about thirty degrees lopsided. 

Ernie could go immediately 
back to bed and tell of his 

41 




dream tomorrow, or he could 
make things worse by yelling 
at the men below. 

I T WASN’T necessary to yell. 

As if they had seen him 
through the tops of their bald- 
ing heads, they motioned to 
the bartender, then pointed 
squarely at his vantage point. 
Ernie felt the quavering im- 
pulse to run, and yet even in 
a nightmare you try desper- 
ately to learn the ending. 

The man in the white coat 
set the ladder firmly against 
the floor so that the top ended 
in the slightest kind of tilt 
near the chute door. It was 
not Ernie’s intention to crawl 
through the door, but the way 
the man motioned, and the 
way the men turned briefly 
and waved, simply as if they 
might be old acquaintances 
waiting for him in a hotel 
lobby — it was, to say the very 
least, overwhelming. 

There was a fragrance, an 
allure about the room. It smel- 
led of apples and tobacco and 
brought nostalgic thoughts of 
college days and — and faint 
wisps of the past that were 
not nostalgic. He thought of 
Melinee. He really ought to 
tell her about this. 

The chalky finger motioning 
at him, the unconcerned old 
men on the sofa — and the 
table. It was the antique table, 
missing from the upstairs 
hall, that lured him in. There 
it sat against the far wall. He 
grabbed a jutting two-by-four 



and twisted his body through 
the opening. 

The ladder must have been 
shoved to one side, or per- 
haps it was the claustrophobic 
effect of going through 
the small opening — anyway, 
something. It turned his 
mind, his body, wrong-side 
out. Like the squeezing out of 
a wet mop by a steamroller. 

At the foot of the ladder, 
the man in the bartender’s 
jacket led him to the three 
men. One of them, exception- 
ally fat, jovial, excused him- 
self politely and took Ernie 
aside. 

“You look pale, Ernie,” he 
said. “Having trouble?” 
Groggily, Ernie looked 
about him. “It’s this room. It’s 
lopsided. I think a good thirty 
degrees cattywonkus.” 

The man doused a cigar and 
a quick frown crossed his 
brow. “Good point. Very good 
point. Come with me, Ernie.” 
Ernie looked ; the other men 
paid him no mind. The little 
man waddled through a maze 
of foundation columns, as if 
the whole world were sus- 
pended above them. He 
walked behind the bar to a 
small glass-encased desk, U- 
shaped and covered with dials 
all reading A-B-C-D. 

“Kronkite !” the man called. 
A whirring inside the- room 
shut off. A man with goggles 
and a metal halo stuck his 
head out the door. “Kronkite, 
Ernie here says we are thirty 
degrees off. Can you shift the 

JAMES BELL 



42 




equilibrium? Frankly, I had- 
n’t noticed it.” 

W ITH a silent nod, the man 
named Kronkite shut the 
transparent door, turned three 
knobs, a bell clanged and 
the floor of the whole af- 
fair sank some thirty degrees 
on one side, rose thirty on the 
other. Then the whirring in 
the chamber resumed and 
Ernie was led back to the 
bar. 

“Have yourself a drink, 
man,” his host coaxed. 

“I don’t need one,” Ernie 
said. “Listen, before we go 
on, just one question — ” 

The man smiled pleasantly. 
“Where the heck am I ? And 
what is this going on in my 
basement ?” 

The smile continued. It was 
maddening. 

“Well?” said Ernie. 

“You are here,” the man 
finally said. “And don’t be 
silly, Ernie. Your house has 
no basement.” 

Ernie turned to the bar- 
tender. “I think I will have a 
drink.” 

“Make it a triple,” the little 
man called, and the bartender 
smiled as if his face hurt. 

There was a pained expres- 
sion on Ernie. He sank his 
head into his arms. 

“Cheer up,” the man said. 
“It isn’t worth all that.” 
"What isn’t?” 

“Be happy, man.” 

“I’ll be happy when I get 
out of here, but I’ll be hilari- 

THIRTY DEGREES CATTYWONKUS 



ous when I find out the score 
— and I plan to be hilarious 
before I get happy. Is that 
clear?” 

“You talk as if you had 
been drinking already, man. 
Snap out of it. I like men 
with clear heads.” 

It was not only a delaying 
tactic, Ernie thought; it was 
plainly a case of nerve-bust- 
ing. They were going to force 
it out of him. He had already 
conceded they were not a gang 
of thieves using his basement 
for a hideaway; they were 
not digging a secret tunnel 
for the Defense Department. 

“You like men with clear 
heads? What am I, some sort 
of recruit?” 

“Now !” the man exclaimed, 
suddenly thrust into a new 
frame of mind. “We are now 
on the same plane. You are 
a recruit and we can under- 
stand each other now.” 

“So where is this?” 

“This is your house, of 
course, but we’re not quite 
there yet. We’re in what you 
would call — oh, another di- 
mension.” 

Ernie reached for the drink 
and sniffed it. Its smell fitted 
the situation. "And what does 
that mean?” 

“Oh, you and I have lived 
in the same vicinity all our 
lives, even crossed each 
other’s paths, but we are in 
different dimensions — differ- 
ent worlds in the same place.” 

“You mean like Mars and 
Earth?” 



43 




“I mean like Mars in Earth, 
or vice versa,” the man an- 
swered. 

Ernie jumped up and start- 
ed for the ladder. “I’m getting 
out of here — ” 

“Don’t be a fool ! Climb that 
ladder and you’ll butt your 
skull in!” 

“I came through the hatch. 
I’ll leave through the hatch.” 
“But we’ve shifted thirty 
degrees. You told us to. Now 
the top of the ladder is thirty 
degrees away from the dQor 
of the laundry chute, which is 
quite impossible to reach, my 
friend, because there is per- 
haps dirt and a foundation 
and everything else in the 
way. We’d have to tear out 
our own structure and gouge 
into yours. This we cannot do. 
Too expensive.” 

E RNIE had heard enough. 

He climbed the ladder to 
the top, butted his head and 
climbed down. “Okay. You 
win. What’s the score?” 

“You and Marsha,” the man 
said. 

“Melinee,” Ernie corrected. 
“Melinee in your dimension, 
Marsha in ours. You and she 
exist in our dimension as well. 
Same types, same character- 
istics inwardly. But not the 
same outwardly. Different 
hair, different name — your 
own features were to be 
slightly different here.” 

Ernie sat down on the sofa 
beside the two old men. He 
buried his head. “This is the 

44 



other dimension? Then where 
is the other me?” 

“Oh, no,” his host said. 
“This is not ‘the other’ dimen- 
sion. This is the experimental 
dimension. You are from the 
second. What we are both in 
is a third realm sponsored by 
the government — the federal 
government of The Unison 
States. Congrice sponsored 
this scientific investigation, 
provided we could accomplish 
it before the session ends.” 

The first desire to laugh at 
the stupidity of the nightmare 
grappled with Ernie. But 
when he looked at that ladder 
and remembered the bump on 
his head, he knew this was 
not the time or place for a 
nightmare. 

The man went on, “So we 
talked Senatore Jumphries in- 
to wielding his might in com- 
mittee, the committee on ex- 
tra-dimensional perception 
talked to the President Eisen- 
hoovelt, he addressed the Con- 
grice, and by the single vote of 
Demorep Martini, this thing 
was financed for short dura- 
tion.” 

Ernie opened his eyes and 
looked beyond the bar and the 
experimental lab. It was like 
the inside of a giant ship in 
space or a vessel plowing the 
Pacific. It spread into distant 
chasms of darkness. 

“Our object, of course, is 
to start out the new dimension 
with an Adam and Eve,” the 
host said. 

Ernie sneered. “You think 
JAMES BELL 




you can start a new world!” 
“Oh, we’ve begun it. And 
we chose your home because 
here you are two young new- 
lyweds just starting out in 
life, not too concerned that 
the future holds nothing more 
for you than junior assistant 
to the vice president — ever! 
Here you have more chance 
for development, advancement 
and enjoyment. We have ef- 
fected changes — your Melinee, 
for example. You and Marsha 
will run this dimension. You 
and she will — ” 

“We will not, and I’m going 
to Melinee now. Let me out of 
here.” 

The man politely hid a 
laugh. “Dear sir, I assure you 
there is no way out of the di- 
mension. You are trapped. 
You must remain now, regard- 
less, and conduct our experi- 
ment for us.” 

“You got through to our 
world to find out about us,” 
Ernie said. “How can you 
keep me here?” 

“But we entered your world 
from our own dimension. Our 
people pass back and forth all 
the time, unknown to your 
people. But from this special 
contraption which Congrice 
has rigged up for us, there is 
no immediate escape.” 

Ernie got mad. “Then what 
the devil are these people 
doing here?” 

“Sh,” the man said, “those 
are our Congrice observers.” 
He seemed extremely dis- 
turbed. “Don't let them know 

THIRTY DEGREES CATTYWONKUS 



how you feel. They get angry 
at people who take them on 
wild-goose chases.” 

T HERE was a sudden feel- 
ing of hope that Ernie 
held a monkey wrench in his 
hand. First, he would find out 
all about the thing, then he 
would raise hail Columbia to 
the two Congrice observers 
and get them to thumbs-down 
the experiment. Then if 
there was an ounce oi hu- 
maneness in them, they would 
free him. 

“Okay, I'll calm down. But 
let me know the rest. When 
will I see Melinee?” 

“Marsha,” the man said 
firmly, “will be along shortly. 
We must first lift the initial 
dimension prototype to the 
exact level of your house. 
Every coordinate must match 
each stick of furniture in your 
own dimension. Then we can 
begin working outward — ” 
“Working outward ?” 
“From your house. It is to 
be the beginning of this — er 
— civilization you and Marsha 
are to create. You will observe 
in each direction there is still 
darkness? When we have 
manipulated the realm into 
the exact position of the 
ground floor of your house, 
we will install a series of 
transitional burnouts. These 
will break down molecular re- 
sistance which our more 
powerful equipment creates 
on solid portions of your 
house. Everything will fit in- 

45 




to place, and you and Marsha 
will report to us regularly.” 

Ernie was fuming. “Then 
we are your prisoners?” 

“Oh, but you’ll enjoy every 
minute of it! We created the 
origin, the nucleus, in the 
home of some newlywed in 
your dimension for the mere 
purpose of convenience of 
adaptability. We will bring in 
teams who will plant ersatz 
crops, trees, cut streams, cre- 
ate weather — put life into the 
whole place. With your dimen- 
sion’s home and our dimen- 
sion’s scientific advantages, 
you can have full reign of pop- 
ulating a wonderful new 
world.” 

Ernie was madder than he 
had ever remembered. “And if 
I refuse?” 

“You can’t refuse. Marsha 
will be here momentarily; we 
have been experimenting with 
her changes in hair, mood, ex- 
pression — we hypnotized her 
on occasions. The extra door 
in the hallways? Sooner or 
later she will see it, wonder as 
you did and open it. This time 
we will have the magnetic field 
force turned on. You see, 
Ernie, you came in the wrong 
way and — ” and here he paus- 
ed abruptly — “quite a prob- 
lem has been posed.” 

“I’ll say it has !’’ 

“Yes. You see, you were 
supposed to come through the 
door, and you still will, for 
there was a technical miscal- 
culation in our instruments 
which, while allowing you to 

46 



enter this new dimension, also 
did not allow you to enter. You 
yourself suggested we correct 
by thirty whole degrees. Well, 
we are not set up for more 
than one field force entrance 
per person. The Congrice 
didn’t allot us that much 
money.” 

Ernie’s eyes grew wild and 
bright. “So, technically, I’m 
not even here?” 

“Technically, your other 
self is still up by the laundry 
chute looking in or going back 
to bed, or whatever.” He 
scratched his balding head. 
“Really an unfortunate event. 
For when the other you enters 
our hallway door, we shall 
have to do away with one of 
you. It would not only frighten 
Marsha, but the federal gov- 
ernment would accuse us of 
waste, corruption and heaven 
knows what else.” 

The wildness in Ernie’s eyes 
turned into a gleam. “You 
mean your government just 
wouldn’t understand?” 

“Right,” the man said un- 
happily. “There’s more politics 
in science than you’d ever be- 
lieve possible.” 

“Mister, I think I have a 
solution.” 

“You haver

plosions, a sputtering red fire, 
a terrible burst of black smoke 
and a sudden explosion that 
turned the whole new dimen- 
sion — such as it was — into a 
white blinding sun. 

When the nausea left, he 
saw the bodies lying on a 
green grassy area in what 
seemed to be Washington, D. C. 
He made his way in torn pa- 
jamas to Unison Station, paid 
a man to go out and buy him a 
second-hand suit by giving up 
his gold wedding band, then 
found the Senatoreale Office 
Building, located the office of 
the Senatore of Iowaki, as he 
had planned to do, and asked 
for permission to enter the 
“other” dimension to take 
home movies. The senatore 
asked him the name of his 
home town, accused him of 
lisping it, handed him a year’s 
free pass to Other World and 
a two-year pass to the Sena- 
toreale in session. 

Ernie, following instruc- 
tions on the card, walked to a 
little white building near the 
Washingable Monument, step- 
ped inside, handed a man his 
Other World card, then walk- 
ed through a door, felt sick at 
his stomach, came out to the 
streetcar line to Melinee and 
home. 

When he got there, it was 
almost daylight, and the front 



door was locked. He climbed 
through an upstairs window, 
looked through the laundry 
chute, saw nothing and return- 
ed to his bed. Melinee was still 
sleeping soundly. 

He wrestled with his pillow 
a while. Then the alarm went 
off. 

The rest was simple. At 
breakfast he told her he was 
taking the day off. 

“Darling, why on Earth?” 

“We’re moving,” he said. 

“But why?” 

“There was an explosion in 
the night. I think it was gas 
escaping.” 

“We might have died !” she 
cried. 

Ernie closed his eyes. “Go 
look in the hall, dear, and tell 
me what you see.” 

When she returned, she was 
in a quandry. 

“Well?” he asked. “Did you 
see that crazy extra door 
blown off the wall?” 

“No, Ernie, but there’s a 
man at the door in pajamas 
like yours who claims he’s 
been following you.” 

Ernie squinted. “Who is 
he?” 

“He says his name is Ir- 
vin — ” 

“Irvin?” Ernie barked. 

“ — and, dear, he’s the spit- 
ting image of you.”

THIRTY DEGREES CATTYWONKUS

When Day is Done 

By ARNOLD CASTLE 



If there is a bit of the jungle 



in every man — why not put 



every man into a bit of the jungle? 



I T WAS three in the after- 
noon and quitting time at 
Utopian Appliances, Inc. Bert- 
ram J. Bernard, the firm’s 
stocky, thick-jawed president, 
waited discreetly at his desk 
for a few minutes, then closed 
the file he had been studying, 
bid his secretary a pleasant 
evening, and strode calmly out 
of the office. 

He did not want to appear 
eager, and succeeded superbly 
in that. Joining several junior 



executives, he conversed ge- 
nially with them as they de- 
scended to the rapid-transit 
floor. Three of the bright, con- 
fident young men decided to 
stop for a quick one at the 
building’s plush saloon. Well, 
that was okay — Bernard had 
been a late-runner in his youth. 
But now, well into middle age, 
he had learned that life had 
other demands and pleasures. 

“Have a good run, B. B.,’’ 
said Watkins, the treasurer, at 



48 




the rap-tran gate. “Gloria's 
coming in on the three-thirty 
and we’re going to dinner and 
then some musical or other 
she’s been dying to see.” 

So Bernard entered the rap- 
tran alone, though surrounded 
by scores of pushing, jabber- 
ing strangers. Finding a seat 
on the aisle, next to a electron- 
ics company vice-president 
whom he knew slightly, he en- 
gaged in trade conversation 
during the five minutes it took 
the monorail to reach his stop. 
He and the electronics execu- 
tive got off, as did about half 
of the rap-trans passengers, 
mostly middle-aged men like 
himself. Early-runners. 

The escalator from the mon- 
orail stop descended directly 
into the Jungle Station be- 
neath. In the large lobby the 
crowd dispersed and Bernard 
was again alone when he 
reached the dressing rooms. 
This was not surprising he 
reflected; not many members 
of his J ungle Station could af- 
ford the elaborate private 
locker unique to this wing of 
the building. He pressed his 
thumbprint to the lock and the 
door slid back. 

Inside, he undressed com- 
pletely, noting with critical 
satisfaction the strength and 
color of his body in the full- 
length mirror at one end of 
the locker. He quickly packed 
his clothes, shoes, and brief- 
case into a small suitcase, with 
delivery instructions on the 
top. Then he climbed into 



his jungle suit — knee-length 
shorts, sweat shirt, rubber- 
soled shoes, and hip holster. 

He checked the frequency 
setting on the sonic pistol, ad- 
j usting it to the panthers who 
were reported in ascendancy. 
As a last thought, merely a 
whim, he glanced down at the 
station emblem on his sweat 
shirt, just to enjoy the sense 
of pride he derived from the 
large red “U-F” above it. 

Of course there were get- 
ting to be more and more 
ulcer-frees these days, but 
that did not make it any less a 
matter for pride. And anyway 
several factions were pressing 
determinedly for a neurosis- 
free insignia. Though there 
were complications there. Oh, 
well, the important thing’s the 
run, he remembered. 

In the lobby again he depos- 
ited his suitcase at the deliv- 
ery window. Then he stopped 
at the bulletin board to read 
the ascendancy ratings for the 
day. These were official, there- 
fore several days outdated, but 
one could extrapolate. Pan- 
thers were dropping into third 
position, behind polar bears, 
with giraffes at the top by a 
good margin. 

Outside the building he ran 
into a tipster and decided he 
had best buy a dope sheet. He 
gave the seedy little man a 
dollar bill and looked over the 
page. 

“Keep it right where you 
got it, Mac,” the man whis- 
pered hoarsely, nodding to- 



49 




ward the pistol at Bernard’s 
side. “I got it straight, dem 
pant’ers is all over de place. 
Watch out at de water hole, 
specially.” 

G lancing swiftly over the 
page, Bernard saw that 
fifty panthers had entered this 
■sector of the jungle overnight, 
with a herd of fifteen giraffes 
headed well toward the south. 
But he also noted that there 
had been three deaths from 
polar bears in the past week 
in his sector alone. Fortunate- 
ly, the frequency readjustment 
from panthers to polar bears 
was an easy one, three clicks 
clockwise with the thumb. He 
would have to remember about 
the water hole, though it was 
either that or going above the 
rapids. The sharks below the 
rapids were pretty thick dur- 
ing the summer. 

“Thanks, bud,” he told the 
tipster. Then he strode, still 
calm, to the wall. Expertly he 
clambered up its handholds, 
till he reached the top, thirty 
feet from the ground. On the 
other side lay the jungle, its 
lush tropical growth hiding 
from his alert eyes the danger 
that lurked within. He popped 
a Verve pill into his mouth 
and chewed on it thoughtfully. 

Far in the distance, some 
five miles at the narrowest 
point, rose the outer wall. Be- 
tween the two prowled a vari- 
ety of ambivalent robot 
beasts, now ready to dismem- 
ber him, but on weekends ad- 

50 



justed to take small boys and 
girls for short rides or simply 
to stalk about picturesquely. 

Drawing his pistol and plac- 
ing it between his teeth, Ber- 
nard leaped to the ground be- 
tween the wall and a large 
low palm. At once the pistol 
was again in his hand. But 
nothing moved. Now he could 
see clearly the path he must 
take. 

Bending low, he trotted 
along through the under- 
growth. It soon began to clear, 
and still no danger in sight. 
He holstered the pistol and ad- 
vanced, half-walking, half- 
running, till he could hear the 
hiss of the rapids. Enough 
noise to mask the sounds of a 
dozen panthers, he thought. 
But it covered his own foot- 
steps, too, and panthers were 
more phonotropic than polar 
bears, the latter having a 
preference for radar spotting. 

Coyotes were the worst, of 
course, with their damned 
infrared thermo-sensors. They 
could spot a runner even when 
he was in cover. Fortunately 
they were scarce and getting 
more so. Bernard had only en- 
countered a coyote twice, de- 
activating it both times. But 
he had been lucky. He recalled 
tiie story about that city coun- 
cilman. 

An hour later he arrived at 
the river, a half-mile above 
the rapids and well away from 
the water hole. He had seen 
only one beast in the first 
three miles of his trek, a gi- 

ARNOLD CASTLE 




raffe hobbling along in olefac- 
tory pursuit of another runner 
far to the right. Giraffes were 
mainly a nuisance, though 
they could kick and trample a 
man. Bernard had heard of 
such a thing happening, but it 
was a rarity. They were too 
easy to elude. 

He crossed the river on a 
log raft he found, which had 
evidently been rigged to dump 
him in about halfway across. 
At least he had got that far 
on it, he told himself, as he 
struck out for the shore. For 
one horrible moment he 
thought he detected a shark 
upstream, but it was merely 
the shadow of a large palm 
leaf. He had a strong and sen- 
sible fear of sharks. 

A mile farther found him 
crawling over the rocky 
ground as the growls of pan- 
thers reached his acute ears 
from behind a ridge of brush. 
If they heard him, they ig- 
nored him, perhaps more in- 
terested in other quarry. His 
knees and arms were scraped 
but not bleeding, and at last 
he was able to get to his feet 
to make better time. 

It was then that he heard 
the girl’s scream. 

N O REGULATION in the 
rule book discriminated 
against women becoming run- 
ners, but only a few of the 
millions who worked at offices 
and plants in the city did so. 
Also there was nothing in the 
code about helping other run- 

WHEN DAY IS DONE 



ners. Each was entirely on his 
own, free to help or be helped, 
or not helped, if he chose. 

Bernard would never have 
called for help for himself. But 
the sound of the woman’s cry 
appealed to another side of his 
nature. He changed his direc- 
tion, but moved with great 
caution now. Soon he saw her, 
and froze. 

She was clad as he, different 
sector emblem, but the same 
proudly borne “U-F” on her 
sweater. Her face and body 
were young and attractive, 
but her long dark hair was 
tangled and wet, and her 
limbs mud-spattered. She had 
screamed only once, and now 
her small lipsticked mouth 
hung open with terror. 

Backed against a tree, she 
gaped in horror, waiting, as 
three panthers approached 
from as many directions. Her 
sonic lay on the ground outside 
the circle. It was obvious that 
she was finished if Bernard 
did not assist her. 

Raising his hand till the pis- 
tol sight was where he wanted 
it, he modified the angle ad- 
justment till all of the animals 
were within its range. Then 
he depressed the trigger sev- 
eral times. Two fell and the 
third animal leaped at the girl. 
But she twisted around the 
tree and Bernard picked off 
the panther as it readied itself 
for a second spring. At once 
the girl dived for her pistol. 
Proper response, Bernard 
thought approvingly. Then she 

51 




ran toward him and threw 
herself against him, breathing 
deeply in that position for sev- 
eral moments. 

Bernard felt strongly the 
strength and zest of youth as 
he held the girl in his arms. 
Then they turned and walked 
together to the outer wall, 
which was less than half a 
mile away. There was no dan- 
ger from the deactivated pan- 
thers, which would remain out 
of commission for half an 
hour. So they had no reason 
to hurry. 

Bernard helped her climb 
the wall, though she seemed 
quite adept at it herself. On 
the other side they emerged 
upon the street. Across the 
street lay the acres and acres 
of homes which were the city’s 
eastern suburbia. 

“Oh, it was just horrible!” 
the girl finally cried. “All at 
once they sprang. From no- 
where. I tripped and my sonic 
fell out of the holster. I’d be 
dead if it weren’t for you!” 

“Very true,” Bernard 
agreed. “You’ll be more care- 
ful in the future, I hope.” 

“If only I could thank you in 
some way. I owe you so much. 
My apartment is just up the 
next street. Only a few blocks. 
Wouldn’t you like to stop in 
for a drink ? I’m sure you’re as 
tired as I.” 

But Bernard declined. He 
walked her home, then con- 
tinued on, unaware of the en- 
vious glances of young chil- 
dren as he passed. Unaware of 

52 



other runners, early-runners, 
middle-aged men like himself, 
also walking the streets, wear- 
ily but not stooping, not 
frowning. 

How good a warm shower 
would be, thought Bernard, as 
he entered the last mile. His 
wife would probably want a 
drink, so there would be that 
too. And dinner. He was hun- 
gry. 

Ulcer-free and happy, he 
walked the last mile in con- 
tentment. The office was some- 
thing that had happened long 
ago, would happen again to- 
morrow, but could never in- 
vade his thoughts that night. 
And he knew exactly how his 
wife would greet him at the 
door. 

“TTELLO, darling. How was 

-H the run?” she asked, 
kissing him as he came into 
the house. “You only made 
fair time this evening. Some- 
thing happen?” 

“No, pretty routine. Pan- 
thers are on the increase. I 
came across three of them at- 
tacking- a girl runner. Works 
as a copy writer in the city. 
She claims that the jungle 
cured her ulcers completely. 
Really remarkable.” 

“Mmm-hmm,” said Vir- 
ginia, taking his holster. “At- 
tractive, no doubt. I suppose 
she tried to seduce you. I’ve 
heard stories about those jun- 
gle women.” 

“Nothing of the sort. Just 
suggested I drop in for a 



ARNOLD CASTLE 




drink. After all, she was grate- 
ful." 

What nonsense, he told him- 
self as he showered, Virginia 
suggesting that the girl had 
intended to seduce him. Oh, 
well, what difference did it 
make? 

Man, that hot water felt 
good! Even on his scratched 
legs and arms. 

How many years had he 
been making the run now? 
Twenty-three, almost. In a 



way he could consider himself a 
sort of a pioneer. And to think 
that the only reason he had 
started jungle running in the 
first place was to please a su- 
pervisor ! Those days everyone 
did it. 

As he dried himself off, 
hearing the tinkle of cocktails 
in the living room, he wonder- 
ed if the panthers would move 
south, away from the water 
hole, before tomorrow’s run. 

END 



THE RELUCTANT BRAIN 

Sir Isaac Newton had one of the most powerful intellects ever housed 
in a human skull, yet it was only with fantastic difficulty that the results 
of his thinking could be pried away from him. 

His invention of the calculus is a prime example. Sir Isaac first 
worked it out as a tool for his own private use in 1666 — at the age of 24 
— for investigating mathematical relationships in his theory of universal 
gravitation. For nearly a quarter of a century, New'tonian calculus 
existed only in notes locked in his desk. Not until Leibnitz’s somewhat 
different approach was already the talk of the scientific world did New- 
ton allow his to be published. 

Among his greatest practical inventions was the one based on a mis- 
take. In investigating the laws of optics, he came to the conclusion that 
a lens would necessarily and always scatter the color of light passing 
through it, like a prism in a spectroscope. So Newton invented the re- 
flector telescope in 1668, at the age of 26. 

Like Einstein and many others, Newton proved that youth is the period 
of intellectual daring and discovery, and that making it defer to the 
“experience and wisdom” of elders would have suffocated mankind’s 
most dazzling achievements at birth. Sir Isaac continued to contribute 
to scientific thought beyond his twenties, but he became increasingly in- 
volved in mysticism and politics; his last researches were complicated 
theology, and his last job was Master of England’s Mint. 

The famous apple? That was a bedtime story told to Newton’s grand- 
niece when she was a little girl. She repeated it to Voltaire years later, 
and Voltaire told it to the world.

course a planet has a right to he strange 



men 



By C. C. MacAPP 



A LYARSMIT clung to the beast way off in the very far 
top of a tall swaying distance, 
hair and squinted toward the “It's coming this way, all 
ponderous caterpillar-shaped right,” he called down to Bru- 



56 





shorter and pudgier than he 
was. 

Alyar grinned down at him, 
then looked toward the front 
of their own beast. “I think 
so,” he said. “Our eyestalks 
are up and signaling. The pin- 
cers aren't active, though. It 
must be a friend-beast.” 

“I don't see how they can 
recognize each other this far 
apart,” said Bru doubtfully. 
“We'd better go tell Paboss.” 

“He sees it.” Alyar looked 
aft to where the leader of the 
smit clan perched on another 
hair, a good shout from 
Alyar's. 

“You'd better come down,'' 
said Bru. “He clobbered Jor- 
smit for being in sight, the 
last time we met another 
beast.” 

“He doesn't care when we’re 
this far away.” Nevertheless, 
Alyar climbed down; it was- 
n't all comfort at the top of a 
hair, especially when the beast 
felt you and twitched. “Let's 
go back there. He might know 
who it is.” 

He started through the thick 
growth of shorter hair, and 
Bru followed. They moved 
carefully, listening; it would 
be nip-and-tuck if only the 
two of them encountered a fley. 
They heard a few, detoured 
around them, eventually reach- 
ed Paboss's outpost. 

The leader was down from 
the hair, sitting with his back 
against it, munching dried 
meat. Three spearmen with 
him jumped up when they 

58 



heard Alyar and Bru coming, 
then, recognizing them, re- 
laxed. 

Pabosssmit grunted and 
gestured toward the joint of 
meat beside him. “Help your- 
self.” He eyed Alyar keenly. 
“That you on the hair up for- 
ward ?” 

“Yes, boss. But I made sure 
I came down in time.” 

“Don't go showing your- 
self again before we make con- 
tact.” 

“I won't. Could you tell who 
it was?” 

“Looked like the jaksin 
beast.” 

“Oh. We don't fight them, 
do we?” Alyar was a little dis- 
appointed ; he'd never been in 
a fight. 

Paboss grinned. “No, but 
we don't trade with them, 
either. Pabossjaksin doesn't 
like me.” 

Alyar remembered some- 
thing he’d heard. “Was that 
where you stole Maboss?” 

The grizzled leader filled his 
thick chest and chuckled. 
“That’s right. Stole her right 
out from under his nose!” He 
extended his arms, showing 
some scars. “Here's where he 
got me, before I knocked him 
out. Here's where Ma bit me.” 

“She bit you?” 

“Sure. Any girl worth steal- 
ing’ll put up a fight. I had to 
haul her along, kicking and 
screaming, and fight off half 
the jaksin clan at the same 
time. It was some party.” 

Alyar sighed, thinking what 

C. C. MacAPP 




it must be like to go raiding. 
“I’m old enough to have a wo- 
man of my own,” he mused. 

Immediately, Paboss glow- 
ered. “Don't you go getting 
any ideas, hear? I don't want 
an open war with the jaksins. 
We've got enough trouble al- 
ready, with the grans and the 
kendies.” He put a hand ten- 
tatively on his club. “You 
hear?” 

“Yes, boss,'' said Alyar 
hastily. 

D URING the rest of the day 
the two beasts halved the 
distance between them. Near 
evening, Alyar led Bru, pro- 
testing, up to the smit beast's 
head and down over the edge 
where they could see forward 
and remain hidden in the short 
hair. It was dangerous; the 
beast might mistake them for 
fleys and reach up with a pin- 
cer-tentacle, which could move 
fast, considering the size. 

When the slow hunching 
gait stopped and the beast set- 
tled down for the night, they 
went back to the thickly fur- 
red spot where the clan lived. 
Two of the moons were up, 
and with the excitement of 
being near another clan, no- 
body wanted to sleep yet. 

Alyar left Bru with an aud- 
ience of young people who 
hadn't seen the other beast 
yet, and went looking for the 
older men. They were in a 
clearing, rehashing stories 
about other clans, especially 
about the jaksins, which was 



an old one with a fine reper- 
toire of legends. Maboss had 
naturally brought the stories 
with her. 

Just now, Paboss was re- 
telling a fascinating, if ridic- 
ulous one, about how people 
had originally come from an- 
other world on a beast that 
could fly. 

Alyar sat and listened for 
a while, then, when the icy 
evening rain broke up the ses- 
sion, went to his sleeping place 
in a patch of protecting curly 
hair. After the first sleep, 
when it was midnight and dry 
again, he sneaked to where 
Bru slept, hissed at him, and 
drew him away. “Are you 
game for a little trip?'' 

“Where? You mean up 
front again?'' 

“No. Over to the jaksin 
beast. Just for fun.” 

Bru was horrified. “At 
night? We'd freeze! Anyway, 
you heard Paboss!” 

“We can find something to 
put on over our own clothes, 
and wrap our feet in leather. 
All Paboss said was I mustn't 
try to steal a girl. Nobody'll 
miss us for one day, and the 
beasts will be together by to- 
morrow noon. We could bring 
back some kind of souvenirs.” 
“You must be crazy! What 
if the jaksins caught us?” 
“They'd only haze us a lit- 
tle, if we hadn't done any- 
thing. Think of it — besides 
Paboss and Maboss, only seven 
smits have ever been to an- 
other beast !”

B UNDLED in extra gar- 
ments, they sneaked to the 
curve of the beast’s side. Bru 
acted as if he were going to his 
own funeral. When they got 
down to where the hair grew 
out horizontally, they moved 
out beyond the short stuff and 
dropped from one coarse emer- 
gent to another ; then, finally, 
to the ground. Apparently no 
one had heard them. They ran 
toward the front of the beast, 
staying as close to the furry 
belly as possible, for warmth 
and concealment. 

The jaksin beast was due 
north, half-hidden by the ho- 
rizon and hard to make out 
against the background of the 
tremendous Forest where it 
had been feeding. Beyond the 
trees and a little to the right 
was a volcano, exhaling fiery 
clouds but not muttering au- 
dibly at the moment. East of 
them was a river ; to the west, 
on the far side of the beasts, 
another Forest. It was not 
surprising that the two beasts 
had met, since they were on a 
narrow strip of hardened lava 
between river and Forest. 

They traveled in long jumps, 
gradually closing the distance 
to the jaksin beast. Near it, 
they saw that it was awake, 
with all four front eyestalks 
and one pair of pincers ex- 
tended toward them. 

They halted out of reach. 
“Do you think he’ll know 
we’re not jaksins?” Bru whis- 
pered. 

“I don’t think they care who 



lives on them, just so we keep 
the fleys down. Let him get a 
good look at us and he’ll see 
we’re people.” 

He was right, but by the 
time the huge appendages be- 
gan to retract, the cold was 
getting through the clothing. 
They hurried for the shelter 
of the hair. Warm again, they 
chewed some of the meat 
they’d brought along and con- 
sidered what to do next. 

“We’d better go along the 
ground to the rear,” Alyar 
said. “The men will be mostly 
near the front, on guard. Back 
there, there’ll only be women 
and children.” 

“But we’ll be a long way 
from home. What if the beasts 
don’t come together?” 

“Oh, they usually stop and 
talk, or whatever they do, for 
three or four days. We’ll have 
a chance to sneak back.” 
“Why don’t we just cut off 
some hairs right here for sou- 
venirs and go home?” 

“Don’t you even want to 
spy on the clan?” 

Bru sighed unhappily. 
“You’re not actually going to 
try to steal a girl, are you?” 
“Well — no. But it would be 
fun, wouldn’t it?” His imagi- 
nation began to percolate. 
“We’re not far from the Warm 
Ground. That’s w'hat the first 
smit did. He stole a girl and 
couldn’t get home with her, so 
they lived for a whole season 
on the Warm Ground until 
they found a young beast and 
started their own clan.”

“If you’ve got any crazy 
ideas like that, you can count 
me out. People who get lost 
from their beasts get caught 
by Demons, or outlaws, or 
eaten by terrible animals. 
Next you’ll be talking about 
going to Iron Mountain and 
fighting the Iron Fley!” 

“Huh. The explorers who 
came back with all those sto- 
ries probably exaggerated to 
make themselves look braver. 
Anyway, all Pm asking you to 
do is climb on the back end of 
this beast and spy on the 
jaksins.” 

It took the rest of the night 
to reach the blunt rear end, 
which had only one pair of 
eyestalks and one of pincers. 
They went through the pro- 
cess of letting the beast see 
them again, so it wouldn’t 
think they were fleys when 
they began to climb, then pick- 
ed a low rigid hair to start on. 

It was a good four man- 
lengths up, too much of a jump 
even in this light gravity for 
Bru, who missed and floated 
back to the ground, contort- 
ing, while Alyar tried to con- 
trol his laughter. He uncoiled 
a rope. 44 You need a good live- 
ly girl to work some of that 
fat off you,” he chuckled as he 
hauled Bru up. 

Panting, Bru pulled himself 
onto the hair. 44 You’ll get me 
killed before I ever have a 
chance to get married. Do you 
think they heard us?” 

44 No. We haven’t heard them 
yet, and they’re bound to be 



jabbering like women always 
are.” He coiled the rope and 
they began to climb. 

W HEN they were halfway 
up, there were squeaks 
and rumbles below them. They 
stopped, holding their breaths, 
while the tentacle curled to- 
ward a spot only thirty or for- 
ty man-lengths away and the 
great claw began digging at 
the fur. Evidently something 
itched there ; and in a few mo- 
ments, they did hear the 
screech of a hurt fley. They 
resumed climbing. 

When the skin was level 
enough to walk on, they began 
hearing voices — the giggling 
of girls and the drier chatter 
of older women, but no men’s 
voices. They crept forward, 
parted the hair very carefully, 
and peered out. 

They must have found the 
quarters of a very important 
family, for the clearing was 
freshly cut and expensive wo- 
ven rugs covered the skin. The 
walls were evenly trimmed, 
with several hung paintings. 
Sleeping places had been cut 
into one side and lined with 
soft leather from the under- 
parts of fleys. 

Alyar had only a glance for 
all this luxury, though, for 
within two man-lengths of 
him sat a pair of eminently 
stealable girls. Temptation 
battered at him. One, evident- 
ly the older sister, was well 
muscled and lithe, but plump 
enough to have curves every- 

61 



A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 




where. The other was beauti- 
ful too, but more slender. They 
had the black hair and tawny 
smooth skin of the jaksins. 
Each wore a short lounging 
skirt of dainty leather which 
left few secrets. 

Prudence, overwhelmed, 
hardly put up a fight. 

Alyar maneuvered Bru care- 
fully back until he could whis- 
per. He ignored the desperate 
protests. “Shut up. All you 
have to do is stay here and 
wait for me, and when you 
hear a commotion, screech like 
a fley. You can do that much, 
can’t you?” 

Bru, groaning, finally nod- 
ded. 

A length from the clearing, 
Alyar chose a young hair- 
shoot and put the point of his 
spear in the tender spot at its 
base. He jabbed with all his 
weight, then dove for the 
clearing. The beast’s involun- 
tary twitch came as he broke 
into the open. 

The women were scram- 
bling to their feet, with cries 
of “Beastquake!” and right 
on schedule Bru cut loose with 
a fine series of fley screeches. 
In the confusion nobody no- 
ticed that Alyar was a stran- 
ger until he scooped up the 
two girls, one under each arm, 
and jumped for the fur. 

It was hard going, with 
both of them grabbing at hairs 
to hold them back, scratching 
him, and in general being un- 
cooperative. He was panting 
when he reached Bru. 



“Here!" he gasped, consid- 
erately tossing him the slen- 
der one who’d be easier to 
carry. “This one’s yours.” 
The plump one knew by now 
what was happening. Slyly, 
she went limp until Alyar re- 
laxed; then she twisted sud- 
denly and got her teeth at his 
left shoulder. He yelled as she 
took out a respectable divot of 
flesh, and spun her around so 
she couldn’t reach him again. 

There was much screaming 
behind them, but no pursuit 
yet. Alyar urged Bru to the 
base of the nearest eyestalk. 
“Start climbing!” 

“But we’ll be trapped up 
there!” 

“No, we won’t. Go on!” 

T HEY were ten man-lengths 
up before a few old men 
and a crowd of women and 
children appeared at the base 
of the stalk. Seeing Alyar’s 
spear-hand free part of the 
time, none acted anxious to 
follow them. 

Now they were high enough 
to be hurt in a fall, and the 
girls had prudently stopped 
struggling. Alyar’s twisted her 
head and glared at him. “My 
father will feed you to the 
fleys!” 

Alyar grinned. “He’ll have 
to catch us first. What’s your 
name?” 

“Go to hell.” 

He let go of the scale he 
was clinging to with his right 
hand, and pinched her in a 
vulnerable spot. She shrieked. 



62 



C. C. MacAPP 




“If I have to keep pinching 
you,” he said, “we’ll probably 
fall. You’d better tell me your 
name.” 

She hesitated, then said 
icily, “Janeejaksin.” 

“Hm. You seem to be rich 
girls. You wouldn’t be the Pa- 
boss’s daughters, would you ?” 

Janee wouldn’t answer, but 
the other girl did, rather cor- 
dially. “Yes, and my name’s 
Marisujaksin. Are you going 
to steal us and make smits of 
us?” 

“They’ll never get off this 
eyestalk,” Janee said scornful- 
ly. 

Alyar motioned Bru higher. 
The figures around the base 
grew tiny and the stalk taper- 
ed to only half the girth of a 
man. It swayed a little, and 
they moved around to what 
would be the upper side if it 
bent. 

Shouts could be heard now 
from farther forward ; un- 
doubtedly the fighters would 
arrive soon. Bru looked ner- 
vously in that direction. “What 
are we going to do — bargain 
with them?” 

“No. Listen carefully. You 
know about people riding a 
pincer. We’re going to get one 
up here, and when it’s close 
enough, jump onto it and ride 
it to the ground.” Alyar grin- 
ned at the protests, put his 
spear-point between two 
scales, and jabbed. 

In a minute the eyestalk be- 
gan to bend ponderously down- 
ward. Far below they could 



see the pincer-tentacle start- 
ing up to meet it. 

“Be lively, now!” Alyar 
warned. 

It took a while for the 
pincer to arrive. They jumped 
from two man-lengths, landed 
on the slanting horny surface, 
and slid. Alyar, hanging onto 
Janee with one arm, managed 
to get the other around a small 
prong. He threw a glance to- 
ward Bru and saw that he’d 
made out all right too. They 
waited. 

Even though the irritation 
had stopped, the beast was 
going through with the 
scratching after hauling all 
that weight to such a height. 
The tip of the pincer sawed 
deliberately at the place Alyar 
had jabbed, and then they 
started down. 

The movement was faster 
than it looked from a distance ; 
still, it was a long way to the 
ground. Partway down, the 
beast saw them and the claw 
halted. They crouched while 
the stalk bent to bring the 
immense eye directly over 
them, but evidently the crea- 
ture was only wondering what 
they were up to now, for after 
a while the tentacle started 
down again. 

Three man-lengths from the 
ground they jumped, landed, 
and bounded away out of 
reach. 

M EN, shouting, were cling- 
ing to long hairs, but no- 
body was climbing the eye-

A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 




stalk. Perhaps no one wanted 
to imitate the novel descent. 
Closer shouts indicated a 
group coming down through 
the fur. 

“What now?” Bru asked. 

It was a reasonable ques- 
tion. Even if they dared go 
home, they'd have to parallel 
the whole length of this beast 
and could hardly avoid inter- 
ception. Alyar and Bru had 
discarded their extra clothing, 
while the girls were almost 
bare, so warmth would be an 
absolute necessity when night 
came. 

Alyar looked northward to- 
ward the volcano. The Warm 
Ground was supposed to sur- 
round it for some distance; 
maybe they could reach that 
before night. There wasn't 
much time to ponder. Men 
were already dropping to the 
ground. He picked up Janee 
and ran for the nearest cover, 
which was the Forest. “Come 
on, we can’t stay here!” 

Bru didn't have to carry 
Marisu — she was evidently 
coming along regardless, even 
though she wailed a little — so 
he was able to keep up. “We're 
not going into the Forest, arc 
we?” he panted. 

“Just into the edge to get 
out of sight. Then we’ll de- 
cide.” 

They were still a medium 
shout ahead when they came 
to the first colossal uprights; 
trunks so thick it would take 
a man many breaths to run 
around one; towering so high 

64 



one tended to forget there 
were any tops. In between 
were smaller plants, some 
with flowers, that formed a 
thicket as dense as fur. 

Alyar paused, thinking of 
the stories he'd heard about 
the Forest. But there was no 
doubt about how real the dan- 
ger was behind them, so he 
held his spear at the ready and 
plunged into the growth. 

Janee opened her mouth to 
scream, and he hastily muf- 
fled it with his hand. “Do you 
want to attract every Demon 
in the Forest?” 

Her eyes widened and she 
quit struggling. 

He listened to the shouts 
from outside, then pointed 
north. “That way.” 

Bru gaped. “But that's away 
from home!” 

“We can't go home yet. 
Anyway, the jaksins'll expect 
us to. They're moving south 
already. Hear them?” 

Inside the Forest, in the 
deep shade, there was less veg- 
etation so that they were able 
to move easily. Whenever 
Janee looked ready to scream, 
Alyar pretended to see or 
hear something, and by the 
time she was wise to that, 
they were out of earshot. 

Their luck didn't last long, 
though. They heard a sound, 
whirled, and saw a small being 
on a branch, watching them 
with malevolent yellow eyes. 

The girls whimpered, and 
Bru moaned, “A Demon!” 

It had taken a strange shape, 

C. C. MacAPP 




with four limbs and one other 
appendage that looked like a 
tentacle. It was covered with 
short black fur, very thick 
and fine. Just now it had a set 
of claws for clinging to the 
tree. 

Before they could run, it 
opened its mouth and uttered 
a curse, which sounded like 
“Meow!” 

“Let’s get out of here !” Bru 
whispered. 

Alyar knew better. “There’s 
no use running ; we’re already 
cursed. The only thing is to 
try to appease it.” 

“Maybe we could give it the 
girls?” 

Alyar wavered. He’d become 
quite attached to Janee, though 
he was a little tired of being 
bitten and scratched, and he 
had gone to a lot of trouble to 
get her. “Let’s try meat first,” 
he decided. 

He got a small piece out of 
his pouch and extended it on 
the end of his spear. Heart 
pounding, he moved closer. 
The Demon tensed as if to 
jump at them, then seemd to 
change its mind. It wrinkled 
its nose (which Alyar hoped 
was a sign of favor) and final- 
ly stretched out its head and 
took the meat. It chewed dain- 
tily and swallowed. 

Alyar let out his breath. 
Nothing was guaranteed, of 
course, but possibly . 

The Demon said, “Meow,” 
in a different tone. 

Carefully, they edged to- 
ward the open. After a few 



steps Bru began to run. Im- 
mediately, there was a loud 
“MEOW!” and he stopped. 

In a moment the Demon 
came into sight, walking on 
the ground. Alyar noticed that 
it had ungrown the claws. As 
he looked (no doubt reading 
his thought) it grew them 
again, stretched out its two 
front limbs, lengthened its 
body, and yawned. 

They started on, but were- 
n’t able to make much time 
until they found that the De- 
mon wanted to be carried. 

A T THE edge of the Forest, 
it was disappointing to 
see how little distance they 
had covered. The nearest end 
of the jaksin beast, hunching 
slowly away now toward the 
smit beast, was still within 
three shouts. However, no 
jaksins were in sight. 

Again, Alyar hesitated; 
troubles seemed to be piling 
up. Still, he didn’t see any 
choice. “We’ll have to go to the 
Warm Ground,” he said. 

The girls sobbed a little, and 
he frowned at them. “ Now 
what’s wrong?” 

“There are terrible outlaws 
there, and Demons, and — and 
things.” 

His patience ran out. “To 
hell with them! We already 
have one Demon ; do you 
think it’s going to share us 
with everything on the plan- 
et? Come on!” 

Janee didn’t insist on being 
carried now ; evidently she felt 

65 



A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 




compromised enough to come 
along. They hurried, stopping 
only once to finish up their 
food. They were thirsty, but 
Hot Water was supposed to 
come up out of the Warm 
Ground, and anyway they 
could wait for the evening 
rains. 

It was dusk, and already be- 
ginning to drizzle, when they 
noticed that the ground under 
their feet was warm. 

This was mostly hardened 
lava, sloping upward toward 
the volcano, but with small 
streams and patches of veg- 
etation. 

Before they found a good 
place to stop for the night, 
Bru pointed ahead. “Look! 
That glow!” 

They went forward cau- 
tiously until they could see 
what must be a Fire, with peo- 
ple sitting around it. Fascin- 
ated, Alyar went closer. Sud- 
denly he heard the girls 
scream, and simultaneously 
two pairs of rough hands 
seized him from behind. He 
wrenched desperately, throw- 
ing himself and the two husky 
men around, but not getting 
free. More came shouting, to 
help pin him down and tie 
him with ropes. It sounded as 
if Bru and the girls were be- 
ing similarly treated. 

A man who acted like the 
leader came running from the 
Fire. “What have we got here? 
Scouts?” He began directing 
squads of spearmen as if he 
expected an attack. “Two wo- 



men with them? Funny. All 
right, you — who’re you spy- 
ing for?” 

“What are you talking 
about?” Alyar demanded, as 
indignantly as his position al- 
lowed. “We’re from the smit 
clan and we’re — trying to get 
home,” he finished lamely. 

“Clan? From a beast? What 
are you doing up here, then ?” 
“We came to keep warm.” 
“Keep warm? Why didn’t 
you build a Fire?” 

“I — we don’t believe in 
Fires.” 

Laughter arose. “Let him 
up,” the leader said. “He must 
be telling the truth. Only a 
fley-eater would be so igno- 
rant.” 

They took off some of the 
ropes. Alyar rubbed at various 
bruises and abrasions, won- 
dering whether he and Bru 
would be killed or made slaves. 
The outlaws would surely keep 
the girls. He wondered wheth- 
er the Demon were going to 
give up its property so easily. 

As if in answer to the 
thought, it came strolling into 
the light, and the leader made 
a sign nervously. “Damn! A 
black cat! Is it yours?” 

“A black what? It captured 
us in the Forest.” 

“It . captured you? In the 
Forest? Then it’s a real De- 
mon!” 

“Of course! How can you be 
so ignorant?” 

“And you’re still alive?” 

“It hasn’t hurt us yet, but 
it won’t let us get away and 



66 



C. C. MacAPP 




It makes us carry it. I think 
we’re uncursed right now. I’m 
not sure ; I sort of lost track.” 
The man gulped and faced 
the Demon. “Please forgive 
us, Demon. We didn’t know 
these people were yours.” 
The Demon looked at him 
scornfully and uttered a curse. 
People moved away, except 
one young spearman who stood 
his ground. “It — it sounds just 
like a cat,” he quavered. 

The leader knocked him 
spinning with the sweep of a 
forearm. “Of course it sounds 
like a cat! How do you think 
it would sound when it’s in cat 
form? Do you expect it to 
speak ingils to us?” He beck- 
oned to several women. “Bring 
food for the Demon, and offer- 
ings of iron and jewels!” He 
glanced at the four captives, 
and added, as an afterthought, 
“Better feed its slaves, too.” 

C OOKED meat was easy to 
chew, but it tasted odd, 
and the fruit was completely 
baffling. Still, they were fill- 
ing. 

The outlaw leader eyed the 
Demon, which had pre-empted 
Janee’s ample lap. “Where is 
it taking you?” 

Alyar didn’t want to admit 
how little he knew of the na- 
ture of things, so he said the 
most awesome thing he could 
think of. “To Iron Mountain.” 
There were gasps. “Oh, 
what unfortunate people you 
are!” the leader said. Then, 
eagerly, “When will you go?” 

A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 



Alyar thought he’d better 
press his luck. “It wants us 
to start right away. It only 
pretends to be asleep like that, 
to see if we’re obedient. Er — 
I seem to have gotten turned 
around. Which way is Iron 
Mountain from here?” 

The man pointed with alac- 
rity. “That way! A third of 
the distance around the vol- 
cano. Here, we’ll help you get 
loaded up.” 

The girls were festooned 
with necklaces and pendants 
of rare stones, while Bru and 
Alyar toted the food and the 
oddments of iron. The outlaws 
had hastily gathered a fabu- 
lous treasure of the metal — 
whole spearheads, and even a 
knife, of it! 

Alyar waved and smiled at 
the outlaws just before they 
were out of sight, then turned 
north. 

“We’ll go upcountry,” he 
said. “They won’t look for us 
there. I’m not sure they won’t 
follow ; they probably don’t 
know what this Demon will do 
any more than we do.” He 
saw some huge rocks not far 
away, with bushes growing on 
top. “Let’s climb up there.” 

When they were halfway to 
the rocks, incredible good for- 
tune struck. The Demon with 
one hurried “Meow !” scram- 
bled away from Janee and ran 
back toward the outlaw camp. 

“Come on!” Alyar exclaim- 
ed. “Maybe we can get out of 
its circle of influence!” 

They climbed the rocks and 

67 




found they could see the Fire. 
Presently they knew the De- 
mon had arrived there, for the 
distant figures scattered. Mo- 
ments later, faint laments 
drifted to them. 

They spent the rest of the 
night awake and watchful. 
“The Outlaws will surely be 
after us now,” Bru said, “to 
get back all this treasure.” 
“Marisu and I want to be 
near our clan,” said Janee. 
“Even if — ” she blushed — 
“you make smits out of us, the 
two beasts would meet once in 
a while and we could visit.” 
Alyar looked eastward, 
where numerous glows mark- 
ed other outlaw camps. The 
volcano was a barrier to the 
north. The outlaws would bar 
the way to the south, expect- 
ing them to head home to the 
beasts. The only direction left 
was west, and he found that 
it pleased him. 

“I guess we’ll just have to 
visit Iron Mountain,” he said. 
“Then we’ll be such heroes 
that Pabosses smit and jaksin 
will have to forgive us.” 

The girls looked at him with 
awe while Bru moaned. 

When the sun came up they 
could see the northern end of 
the Forest, south of which the 
jaksin beast had been feeding. 
Past it, surprisingly visible 
from this altitude, were the 
two beasts, head-to-head with 
eyestalks touching. 

The Forest ran up close to 
the steep side of the volcano, 
leaving only a narrow pass. 

68 



Beyond that was the river 
which, turning south, passed 
the two beasts. Farther up the 
river, acording to legend, was 
Iron Mountain. 

They stayed long enough to 
see what kind of animals 
prowled the country and to 
lay out a course, then climbed 
down and got started. They 
walked all day with only a few 
halts and some minor adven- 
tures with strange animals, 
then found another high place 
to spend the night. In the 
darkness they spotted a single 
Fire west of them. The next 
morning they detoured around 
that spot, and entered the nar- 
row pass. Before noon they 
stood looking down at the 
river. 

T HE canyon was deeper and 
wider than Alyar could 
have imagined, and there was 
more water at the bottom. The 
country ahead, though, was so 
rough that it seemed the easi- 
est way was to climb down 
and go along the river. It took 
them half the afternoon to get 
down. 

Not very long after that, 
Alyar put out his hand. “Wait ! 
I hear voices !” 

They were men’s voices and 
seemed to be coming down- 
stream. 

He pushed the other three 
to a hiding place behind some 
rocks and bushes. When the 
owners of the voices came into 
sight around a turn, he gasped. 
They weren’t walking, but rid-

ing on the water itself, in 
something like a big dish. 

“Magicians !” Bru whis- 
pered. 

Two of the men (there were 
seven) were stroking the water 
with some kind of wands, 
flattened at the ends. They 
acted as if they were fleeing 
from something, talking in 
low voices and staring back 
upstream. Just before they 
came opposite, it caught up 
with them. 

The first thing Alyar heard 
was a loud voice, distorted and 
with an odd accent. He had 
trouble making out the repeat- 
ed words. “Halt or I’ll shoot. 
Advance and be recognized. 
Halt or I'll shoot. Advance — ” 

The thing came into sight — 
flying! He gripped Bru’s 
shoulder. “The Iron Fley!” 

It was made of the kind of 
iron that didn’t rust, and had 
only eight legs, not ten. All of 
them were folded to its sides 
except one with a larger, ob- 
long foot; that one was ex- 
tended toward the fugitives. 

When they saw it, they 
jumped out of their dish and 
sank into the water. 

“Halt or I’ll shoot,” said the 
Iron Fley again, then hurled 
its spell. The dish shattered 
abruptly into small bits and a 
hissing cloud burst 01P of the 
water. 

The terrible creature circled 
over the floating fragments 
for a few minutes, then flew 
off upstream. When it was 
gone the seven magicians ap- 



peared, climbing out of the 
river on the far side. 

“Damn it!” said one. “A 
good boot lost, and not a bit of 
iron. I told you we ought to 
wait for night!” 

“It doesn’t make any differ- 
ence,” said another gloomily. 
“It’s always on watch. No- 
body’s gotten away with any 
iron for three or four sea- 
sons.” 

“Well,” said Alyar, after 
the magicians had straggled 
off down the river, “now we've 
seen it. It certainly put a pow- 
erful spell on that floating 
dish, but it didn’t hurt the 
magicians. Maybe if we’re 
careful it won’t bother us.” 

They followed the twisting 
canyon and eventually began 
to hear a roaring noise ahead. 
It turned out to be the water 
falling over a cliff, and to go 
any farther they had to climb 
out of the canyon again. When 
they were on top they could 
see, ahead of them, what was 
undoubtedly Iron Mountain. 

Parts of it were broken or 
rusted, but most of it was the 
non-rusting kind. Its shape 
was a surprise. It didn’t look 
like a mountain, but some- 
thing made by giants, broken 
off and stuck into the ground. 

It was wonderful to stand 
here, beholding the mightiest 
magic in the entire world. 
Still, Alyar wasn’t satisfied. 
He felt he must go closer, 
even — possibly — touch it. 

“You’d better stay here. 
Bru, if anything' happens to 



A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 



69 




me, take the girls and run. You 
can get back to the beasts by 
going down the river.” 

Bru was dismayed. “Don’t 
go any closer! You saw what 
happened to the magicians’ 
dish !” 

“They were trying to steal 
iron.” He unloaded the metal 
he was carrying, smiled at 
them, and went on. 

H E’D only covered a hun- 
dred man-lengths or so 
when he heard the distorted 
voice, coming from over his 
head. He looked up, then stood 
rooted as the Iron Fley came 
spiraling down toward him. 
He tried to think the purest, 
most serene thoughts he could, 
though the fervent wish to be 
somewhere else kept intrud- 
ing. 

The thing paused a few 
lengths away. “Advance and 
be recognized,” it said. 

He took a faltering hop for- 
ward. “Halt or I’ll shoot,” it 
said, and he stopped. 
“Advance.” 

He did. 

“Halt.” 

He did. 

Finally he was very close to 
it, and he waited for a spell to 
hit him. 

“Name, rank, and serial 
number,” it demanded. Then, 
as he was silent, “Speak or I’ll 
shoot.” 

“I — I’m Alyarsmit! I don’t 
think I’m rank, and I don’t 
know what a serial number 
is.” 



“Friend or foe?" 

“F-friend. I haven’t stolen 
anything. Just some girls.” 
The thing made a buzzing 
sound. “You speak, and you 
have the requisite number of 
limbs, and one head. Are you 
human ?” 

“Y-yes, I’m human.” 
“Name?” 

“Alyarsmit.” 

“Smith? Smith?” It buzzed 
some more. “There was a Colo- 
nel John Smith on the roster. 
Are you his descendant?” 
“Yes,” Alyar hazarded. 

“Mr. Smith, sir, Robojeep 
twenty-seven four nine report- 
ing. All other jeeps inactivat- 
ed, sir. No ship’s personnel or 
other passengers accounted 
for in the last three hundred 
and seventy-four planetary 
cycles. Damage to ship unre- 
pairable without human di- 
rection. Sporadic raids by 
savages, possibly degenerate 
humans, repelled successfully. 
Will you assume manual con- 
trol, sir?” 

Alyar stuck with “Yes.” 
“Very well, sir.” The Iron 
Fley descended and walked to- 
ward him on six of its legs, 
then squatted. 

He stared at its back. Actu- 
ally, it didn’t have one ; it was 
hollowed out from the top, and 
in the hollow were — seats ! 
Four of them! 

Unable to mistake the mean- 
ing, he climbed in and sat 
down. Nothing happened for a 
while. Then the creature be- 
gan to buzz again. “Have you 



70 



C. C. MacAPP 




forgotten the controls, sir? 
The lever on the left is for 
elevation; the other one for 
horizontal motion. Would you 
prefer vocal control?” 

“N-no, this is all right.” 

“Very good, sir.” The buzz 
stopped. 

The levers were just in 
front of him. Gingerly, he 
reached out and gave the left- 
hand one a twitch, then yelled 
and let go of it as they shot up- 
ward. They stopped, and he 
tried again gently. They rose 
more smoothly. 

He experimented with the 
other and moved forward, 
backward, and to the sides. He 
lowered to a height where he 
was less frightened. “Er — 
Fley?” 

“You spoke, sir?” 

“I can go wherever I want?” 

“Except into obvious dan- 
ger, sir. Fm programmed to 
avoid that.” 

Alyar flew toward where 
he'd left his companions. They 
lay face down, lamenting, 
Janee loudest of all. He eyed 
her posterior, and Bru's, with 
some misgivings. The Fley's 
seats were a little skimpy. 

He landed beside them, 
cleared his throat, and waited 
until they raised dumfounded 

f*ar»pc 

“Get in,” he said. 

A GAINST feeble protests 
from the others, he ma- 
neuvered the creature (which 
preferred to be called “Jeep”) 
toward Iron Mountain. When 



they were close Jeep woke up, 
buzzed, and hovered while a 
great doorway slid open. It 
carried the four, clinging to- 
gether, into the hollow black- 
ness within. 

Then, quite suddenly — even 
though the door slid shut be- 
hind them — it was light as 
day inside. 

What a cave ! Cylindrical, all 
of fifty man-lengths across, it 
slanted down until it must 
reach far below ground. Far 
down there, where Jeep was 
taking them, were some level 
platforms. 

As soon as they settled on 
one, a terrible, huge, clanking 
monster, also of non-rusting 
iron, flew toward them. They 
huddled while it spoke. “Mr. 
Smith, sir, Roborepairunit 
seventeen reporting. Ship’s 
power and drive in order. Un- 
able to complete hull repairs, 
or repair other working and 
scouting units, without canni- 
balizing part of living quar- 
ters. Do I have Mr. Smith's 
permission to proceed?” 

Alyar gulped several times, 
and got out “Yes.” 

“Thank you, sir. The job 
will require arc cutting and 
welding and other high-tem- 
perature processes. Will you 
be here very long?” 

“We hope not.” 

“Very well, sir. I'll begin as 
soon as you leave.” 

They sat for a while, won- 
dering what to do. Finally 
Alyar said, “Jeep?" 

“Sir?” 



A PRIDE OF ISLANDS 



71 




“Would we be permitted to 
leave?” 

“At once, sir.” 

More buzzing, and the door 
opened again. 

As they flew away, Jeep 
said, “Sir, Roborepair wants 
to know whether to repair 
ship in its present position or 
move it elsewhere.” 

Alyar was beginning to feel 
more confident. “In its present 
position, I think. For now.” 
As they turned south, Janee 
began to sniffle. 

“What now?” he demanded. 
“I miss my Demon.” 

Alyar turned to Bru. “Isn't 
that just like a woman? She 
wants a Demon again !” 

She raised her head and 
glared at him. “He was cute 
and soft, and he cuddled 
against me and made happy 
sounds. You tamed the Iron 
Fley, and if you really loved 
me, you could surely handle 
one little fluffy Demon!” 

Alyar let Jeep stop and hang 
there while he tried to cope 
with the effrontery of it. After 
all he'd been through, stealing 
her, to have her suggest that 
he go into more danger just to 
satisfy her crazy whim ! 

His hands reached out for 
the levers again. Shaking his 
head dazedly, he started north- 
east to look for the outlaws. 

S OME time later, they were 
headed south again, Janee's 
Demon asleep in her lap. Jeep 
was loggy with iron and other 
treasures extorted from vari- 



ous bands of outlaws. In the 
two rear seats, Bru and Mari- 
su were holding hands. 

He was startled to see two 
more beasts hunching up from 
the south, beyond the smits 
and jaksins. Four of them to- 
gether at one time ! 

When they circled down, 
they found Pabossmit on his 
hair, scowling southward. He 
cringed when he saw the Iron 
Fley, then managed to look 
both dumfounded and furi- 
ous when he recognized Alyar 
and Bru. 

“You young hoodlums! I'm 
glad that thing caught you! 
Look there — those are the 
grans and the kendies coming, 
and Pabossjaksin's so mad 
he'll join them against us!” 
His face softened into the 
start of a grin as he sized up 
the two girls, but then hard- 
ened again. “I hope you're 
proud of yourselves, getting 
your whole clan killed or made 
slaves!” 

Alyar started toward a 
clearing. “Come on down, Pa- 
boss. We've got so much magic 
now, we could laugh at all the 
clans in the world.” And, to 
Jeep, “Jeep, can we bring Iron 
Mountain over here and fly it 
around and show these sav- 
ages they better behave?” 

“A bloodless demonstration? 
Certainly, sir. I'll go aloft at 
once and radio.” 

T HE four stood in a clear- 
ing, with awed smits 
around them at a respectful 



72 



C. C. MacAPP 




distance. Paboss came pushing 
through the hair, as awed as 
any, but less scared. 

“Tamed the Iron Fley!” He 
began to guffaw. “Stole Pa- 
bossjaksin’s own two daugh- 
ters ! Haw, haw ! Young man, 
when I retire . .” His eyes 
covered Janee approvingly, 
then turned back to Alyar. 
“You’re wounded! What — oh, 
toothmarks !” He laughed 
some more. “Didn’t I say any 
girl worth stealing would put 
up a fight?” 



Alyar happened to be look- 
ing toward Bru, who had his 
own knot of admirers. Marisu 
was standing a little behind 
him, as a bride should. At Pa- 
boss’s words, she frowned and 
her eyes fixed on Bru’s smooth 
shoulder. Her gaze grew more 
intent. She moved slowly for- 
ward, her eyes crossing as 
they remained on the spot. 

Closer . 

Closer . 

Bru yelled. 

END 



ANYBODY HOME OUT THERE? 

With an incredible 100,000,000,000 stars in the Milky Way — our own 
medium-sized galaxy, which is just one of at least millions in the uni- 
verse — the question of whether the human race is alone in space has a 
statistical answer: 

We are almost certainly not alone; even if we assume that intelligent 
life can exist only on Earth-type planets, and that Earth-type planets 
can occur in only a tiny fraction of all the Milky Way’s star systems, a 
tiny fraction of that incredible 100,000,000,000 would yield a very large 
number of sister-Earths. And to state that intelligent life can exist only 
on Earth-type planets is pure conservatism, on the order, probably, of 
the theoretical “proof” that a heavier-than-air craft cannot fly. 

But how can we be sure we’re not alone ? 

Two scientists at Cornell suggest listening for messages. 

Even transmitters no better than the ones we already have, they claim, 
could send a radio message that could be picked up quite easily by a 
really good radio receiver — one, say, like the 600-foot radio telescope now 
going up in West Virginia — even if that receiver was 30 or 40 light- 
years away. 

And if our transmitters will do it, why wouldn’t the transmitters be- 
long to an alien race circling, for instance, the Sol-like Tau Ceti or Eta 
Eridani ? They aren’t far, as stellar distances go, and they happen to be 
located where radio interference from clouds of cosmic dust and gas is 
at a minimum. 

Worth trying? It certainly is — and the first steps are being taken 
right now. With an 80-foot antenna, the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory is getting set to listen for signals from other stars. 

It could happen any day — our first contact with intelligent life on 
another planet!

“/^ALL me Zeus,” said the 
v>< Director. 

“Zeus?” said his wife, a 
beautiful woman not over a 
thousand years old. “What an 
egomaniac! Comparing your- 
self to a god, even if he is the 
god of those — those savages!” 
She gestured at the huge 
screen on the wall. It showed, 
far below, the blue sea, the 



black ships on the yellow 
beach, the purple tents of the 
Greek army, the broad brown 
plain, and the white towers of 
Troy. 

The Director glared at her 
through hexagonal dark glass- 
es and puffed on his cigar un- 
til angry green clouds rolled 
from it. His round bald head 
was covered by a cerise beret, 




75 




his porpoise frame by a ca- 
nary yellow tunic, and his 
chubby legs by iridescent 
green fourpluses. 

"I may not look like a god, 
but as far as my power over 
the natives of this planet goes, 
I could well be their deity,” 
he replied. 

He spoke sharply to a tall 
handsome blond youth who 
wore a crooked smile and 
bright blue and yellow tattoo 
spiraling around his legs and 
trunk. “Apollo, hand me the 
Script!” 

“Surely you're not going to 
change the Script again?” 
said his wife. She rose from 
her chair, and the scarlet web 
she was wearing translated 
the shifting micro-voltages 
on the surface of her skin into 
musical tones. 

“I never change the Script,” 
said the Director. “I just 
make the slight revisions re- 
quired for dramatic effects.” 

“I don't care what you do 
to it, just so you don't allow 
the Trojans to win. I hate 
those despicable brutes.” 

Apollo laughed loudly, and 
he said, “Ever since she and 
Athena and Aphrodite thought 
of that goofy stunt of asking 
Paris to choose the most beau- 
tiful of the three, and he gave 
the prize to Aphrodite, Hera's 
hated the Trojans. Really, 
Hera, why blame those simple, 
likable people for the actions 
of only one of them? I think 
Paris showed excellent judg- 
ment. Aphrodite was so grate- 



ful she contrived to get that 
lovely Helen for Paris and — ” 
“Enough of this private 
feud,” snapped the Director. 
“Apollo, I told you once to 
hand me the Script.” 

A chilles at midnight 
paced back and forth be- 
fore his tent. Finally, in the 
agony of his spirit, he called 
to Thetis. The radio which had 
been installed in his shield, 
unknown to him, transmitted 
his voice to a cabin in the 
great spaceship hanging over 
the Trojan plain. 

Thetis, hearing it, said to 
Apollo, “Get out of my cabin, 
you heel, or I'll have you 
thrown out.” 

“Leave?” he said. “Why? So 
you can be with your barbar- 
ian lover?” 

“He is not my lover,” she 
said angrily. “But I'd take 
even a barbarian as a lover 
before I'd have anything to 
do with you. Now, get out. 
And don't speak to me again 
unless it's in the line of busi- 
ness.” 

“Any time I speak to you, I 
mean business,” he said, grin- 
ning. 

“Get out or I'll tell my fa- 
ther!” 

“I hear and obey. But I'll 
have you, one way or another.” 
Thetis shoved him out. Then 
she quickly put on the suit 
that could bend light around 
her to make her invisible and 
transport her through the air 
and do many other things. Out

of a port she shot, straight to- 
ward the tent of her protege. 
She did not decelerate until 
she saw him standing tall in 
the moonlight, his hands still 
raised in entreaty. She landed 
and cut the power off so he 
could see her. 

“Mother, Mother!” cried 
Achilles. “How long must I 
put up with Agamemnon’s 
high-handedness ?” 

Thetis took him by the hand 
and led him into the tent. “Is 
Patroclos around?” she asked. 

“No, he is having some fun 
with Iphis, that buxom beauty 
I gave him after I conquered 
the city of Scyros.” 

“There’s a sensible fellow,” 
said Thetis. “Why don’t you 
forget this fuss with King 
Agamemnon and have fun 
with some rosy-cheeked dar- 
ling?” But a painful expres- 
sion crossed her face as she 
said it. 

Achilles did not notice the 
look. “1 am too sick with hu- 
miliation and disgust to take 
pleasure in anything. I am full 
up to here with being a lion in 
the fighting and yet having to 
give that jackal Agamemnon 
the lion’s share of the loot, 
just because he has been 
chosen to be our leader. Am I 
not a king in Thessaly? 1 wish 
— I wish — ” 

“Yes?” said Thetis eagerly. 
“Do you want to go home?” 

“I should go home. Then the 
Greeks would wish they’d not 
allowed Agamemnon to insult 
the best man among them.” 



“Oh, Achilles, say the word 
and I’ll have you across the 
sea and in your palace in an 
hour!” she said excitedly. She 
was thinking, The Director 
will be furious if Achilles dis- 
appears , but he won't be able 
to do anything about it. And 
the Script can be revised. Hec- 
tor or Odysseus or Paris can 
play the lead role. 

“TyrO,” Achilles said. “I can’t 
leave my men here. 
They’d say I had run out on 
them, that I was a coward. 
And the Greeks would call me 
a yellow dog. No, I’ll allow no 
man to say that.” 

Thetis sighed and answered 
sadly, “Very well. What do 
you want me to do?” 

“Go ask Zeus if he will give 
Agamemnon so much trouble 
he’ll come crawling to me, 
begging for forgiveness and 
pleading for my help.” 

Thetis had to smile. The 
enormous egotism of the beau- 
tiful brute! Taking it for 
granted that the Lord of Crea- 
tion would bend the course of 
events so Achilles could sal- 
vage his pride. Yet, she told 
herself, she need not be sur- 
prised. He had taken it calmly 
enough the night she’d ap- 
peared to him and told him 
that she was a goddess and his 
true mother. He had always 
been convinced divine blood 
ran in his veins. Was he not 
superior to all men? Was he 
not Achilles? 

“I will go to Zeus,” she said. 

77 



HEEL 




“But what he will do, only he 
knows.” 

She reached up and pulled 
his head down to kiss him on 
the forehead. She did not trust 
herself to touch the lips of this 
man who was far more a man 
than those he supposed to be 
gods. The lips she longed for 
. the lips soon to grow cold. 
She could not bear to think 
of it. 

She flicked the switch to 
make her invisible and, after 
leaving the tent, rose toward 
the ship. As always, it hung 
at four thousand feet above 
the plain, hidden in the in- 
flated plastic folds that simu- 
lated a cloud. To the Greeks 
and Trojans the cloud was the 
home of Zeus, anchored there 
so he could keep a close eye on 
the struggle below. 

It was he who would decide 
whether the walls of Troy 
would stand or fall. It was to 
him that both sides prayed. 

T HE Director was drinking 
a highball in his office and 
working out the details of to- 
morrow’s shooting with his 
cameramen. 

“We’ll give that Greek Dio- 
medes a real break, make him 
the big hero. Get a lot of close- 
ups. He has a superb profile 
and a sort of flair about him. 
It’s all in the Script, what 
aristocrats he kills, how many 
narrow escapes, and so on. 
But about noon, just before 
lunch, we’ll wound him. Not 
too badly, just enough to put 



him out of action. Then we’ll 
see if we can whip up a big 
tearjerker between that Tro- 
jan and his wife — what’s her 
name?” 

He looked around as if he 
expected them to feed him the 
answer. But they were silent ; 
it was not wise to know more 
than he. 

He snapped his fingers. 
“Andromache! That’s it!” 

“What a memory! How do 
you keep all those barbaric 
names at your tongue’s tip? 
Photographic!” and so on 
from the suckophants. 

“O.K. So after Diomedes 
leaves the scene, you, Apollo, 
will put on a simulacrum of 
Helenos, the Trojan prophet. 
As Helenos, you’ll induce Hec- 
tor to go back to Troy and get 
his mother, the Queen, to pray 
for victory. We can get some 
colorful shots of the temple 
and the local religious rites. 
Meantime, we’ll set up a 
touching domestic scene be- 
tween Hector and his wife. 
Ring in their baby boy. A 
baby’s always good for ohs 
and ahs. Later, after coffee 
break, we’ll . .” 

Apollo drifted through the 
crowd toward the Director’s 
wife. She was sitting on a 
chair and moodily drinking. 
However, seeing Apollo, she 
smiled with green-painted 
lips and said, “Do sit down, 
darling. You needn’t worry 
about my husband being an- 
gry because you’re paying at- 
tention to me. He’s too busy

shining down on his little 
satellites to notice you/' 
Apollo seated himself in a 
chair facing her and moved 
forward so their knees touch- 
ed. 

“What do you want now?” 
she said. “You only get lovey- 
dovey when you're trying to 
get something out of me.” 
“You know I love only you, 
Hera,” he said, grinning. “But 
I can't meet you as often as 
I'd like. Old Thunder-and- 
Lightning is too suspicious. 
And I value my job too much 
to risk it, despite my over- 
whelming passion for you.” 
“Get to the point.” 

“We're way over our budget 
and past our deadline. The 
shooting should have been fin- 
ished six months ago. Yet Old 
Fussybritches keeps on revis- 
ing the Script and adding 
scene after scene. And that's 
not all. We're not going home 
when Troy does fall. The Di- 
rector is planning to make a 
sequel. I know because he ask- 
ed me to outline the Script for 
it. He's got the male lead pick- 
ed out. Foxy Grandpa Odys- 
seus.” 

H ERA sat upright so vio- 
lently she sloshed her 
drink over the edge of her 
glass. “Why, my brother 
means to kill Odysseus at the 
first opportunity! My brother 
is mad, absolutely mad about 
Athena, but he can't get to 
first base with her. She's got 
eyes only for Odysseus, though 



how she could take up with 
one of those stupid primitives, 
I'll never understand.” 

“Athena claims he has an 
intelligence equal to any of 
us,” said Apollo. “However, 
it's not her but Thetis I meant 
to discuss.” 

“Is my stepdaughter inter- 
fering again?” 

“I think so. Just before this 
conference I saw her coming 
out of the Director's room, 
tears streaming from her big 
cow eyes. I imagine she was 
begging him again to spare 
Achilles. Or at least to allow 
the Trojans to win for a while 
so Agamemnon will give back 
to Achilles the girl he took 
from him, that tasty little 
dish, Briseis.” 

“You ought to know how 
tasty she is,” said Hera bit- 
terly. “I happen to know you 
drugged Achilles several 
nights in a row and then put 
on his simulacrum.” 

“A handy little invention, 
that simulacrum,” said Apollo. 
“Put one on and you can look 
like anybody you want to look 
like. Your jealousy is showing, 
Hera. However, that's not the 
point. If Thetis keeps playing 
on her father's sympathies 
like an old flute, this produc- 
tion will last forever. Frankly, 
I'd like to shake the dust of 
this crummy planet from my 
feet, get back to civilization 
before it forgets what a great 
script writer I am.” 

“What do you propose?” 

“I propose to hurry things

up. Eventually, Achilles is 
supposed to quit sulking and 
take up arms again. So far, 
the Director has been indefi- 
nite on how we’ll get him to do 
that. Well, we’ll help him 
without his knowing it. We’ll 
fix it so the Trojans will beat 
the Greeks even worse than 
the Director intends. Hector 
will almost run them back into 
the sea. Agamemnon will beg 
Achilles to get back into the 
ring. He’ll give him back the 
loot he took from him, includ- 
ing Briseis. And he’ll offer his 
own daughter in marriage to 
Achilles. 

“Achilles will refuse. But 
we’ll have him all set up for 
the next move. Tonight a tech- 
nician will implant a post- 
hypnotic suggestion in Achil- 
les that he send his buddy 
Patroclos, dressed in Achilles’ 
armor, out to scare the kilts 
off the Trojans. We’ll generate 
a panic among the Trojans 
with a subsonic projector. 
Then we’ll arrange it so Hec- 
tor kills Patroclos. That is the 
one thing to make Achilles so 
fighting mad he’ll quit sulk- 
ing ...” 

“Patroclos? But the Direc- 
tor wants to save him for the 
big scene when Achilles is 
knocked off. Patroclos is sup- 
posed to put Achilles’ armor 
on, storm the Scaian gate, and 
lead the Greeks right into the 
city.” 

“Accidents will happen,” 
said Apollo. “Despite what the 
barbarians think, we are not 



gods. Or are we? What do you 
say to my plan?” 

“If the Director finds out 
we’ve tampered with the 
Script, he’ll divorce me. And 
you’ll be blackballed in every 
studio from one end of the 
Galaxy to the other.” 

Apollo winked and said, 
“I’ll leave it to you to make 
Old Stupe think Patroclos’ 
death was his own idea. You 
have done something like that 
before, and more than once.” 
She laughed and said, “Oh, 
Apollo, you’re such a heel.” 
He rose. “Not a heel. Just a 
great script writer. Our plan 
will give me a chance to kill 
Achilles much sooner than the 
Director expects. And it’ll all 
be for the good of the Script.” 

T HAT night two technicians 
went into the Greek camp, 
one to Achilles’ tent and one to 
Agamemnon’s. The technician 
assigned to the King of Myce- 
nae gave him a whiff of sleep 
gas and then taped two elec- 
trodes to the royal forehead. 
It took him a minute to play 
a recording and two to untape 
the electrodes and leave. 

Five minutes later, the King 
awoke, shouting that Zeus had 
sent him a dream in the shape 
of wise old Nestor. Nestor had 
told him to rouse the camp and 
march forth even if it were 
only dawn, for today Troy 
would fall and his brother 
Menelaos would get back his 
wife Helen. 

Agamemnon, though, who 



80 



PHILIP JOSE FARMER 




had always been too clever for 
his own good, told the council 
of elders that he wanted to 
test his army before telling 
them the truth. He would an- 
nounce that he was tired of 
this war they could not win 
and that he wanted to go 
home. This news would sepa- 
rate the slackers from the 
soldiers, his true friends from 
the false. 

Unfortunately, when he told 
this to the assemblage, he 
found far less men of valor 
than he had expected. The en- 
tire army, with a few excep- 
tions, gave a big hurrah and 
stampeded toward the ships. 
They had had a bellyful of this 
silly war, fighting to win 
back the beautiful tart Helen 
for the King’s brother, spill- 
ing their guts all over foreign 
plains while their wives were 
undoubtedly playing them 
false with the 4-Fs, the fields 
were growing weeds, and 
their children were starving. 

In vain, Agamemnon tried 
to stop the rush. He even 
shouted at them what they had 
only guessed before, that more 
was at stake than his brother’s 
runaway wife. If Troy was 
crushed, the Greeks would 
own the trading and colonizing 
routes to the rich Black Sea 
area. But no one paid any at- 
tention to him. They were too 
concerned with knocking each 
other over in their haste to get 
the ships ready to sail. 

At this time, the only people 
from the spaceship on the 



scene were some cameramen 
and technicians. They were 
paralyzed by the unexpected- 
ness of the situation, and they 
were afraid to use their emo- 
tion-stimulating projectors. 
By the flick of a few switches 
the panic could be turned into 
aggression. But it would have 
been aggression without a 
leader. The Greeks, instead of 
automatically turning to fight 
the Trojans, would have killed 
each other, sure that their fel- 
lows were trying to stop them 
from embarking for home. 

The technicians did not dare 
to waken the Director and ac- 
knowledge they could not han- 
dle a simple mob scene. But 
one of them did put a call 
through to one of the Direc- 
tor’s daughters, Athena. 

Athena zipped down to 
Odysseus and found him 
standing to one side, looking 
glum. He had not panicked, 
but he also was not interfer- 
ing. Poor fellow, he longed to 
go home to Penelope. In the 
beginning of this useless war, 
he had pretended madness to 
get out of being drafted. But, 
once he had sworn loyalty to 
the King, he would not aban- 
don him. 

Athena flicked off her light- 
bender so he could see her. 
She shouted, “Odysseus, don’t 
just stand there like a lump 
on a bog ! Do something or all 
will be lost — the war, the hon- 
or of the Greeks, the riches 
you will get from the loot of 
Troy! Get going!” 



HEEL 



81 




Odysseus, never at a loss, 
tore the wand of authority 
from the King’s numbed hand 
and began to run through the 
crowd. Everybody he met he 
reproached with cowardice, 
and backed the sting of his 
words with the hard end of 
the wand on their backs. 
Athena signaled to the tech- 
nicians to project an aggres- 
sion - stimulating frequency. 
Now that the Greeks had a 
leader to channel their cour- 
age, they could be diverted 
back to fighting. 

There was only one obstacle, 
Thersites. He was a lame 
hunchback with the face of a 
baboon and a disposition to 
match. 

Thersites cried out in a 
hoarse, jeering voice, “Aga- 
memnon, don’t you have 
enough loot? Do you still want 
us to die so you may gather 
more gold and beautiful Tro- 
jan women in your greedy 
arms? You Greeks, you’re not 
men. You’re women who will 
do anything this disgrace to a* 
crown tells you to do. Look 
what he did to Achilles. Rob- 
bed him of Briseis and in so 
doing robbed us of the best 
warrior we have. If I were 
Achilles, I’d knock Agamem- 
non’s head off.” 

“We’ve put up with your 
outrageous abuse long 
enough!” shouted Odysseus. 
He began thwacking Thersites 
on the head and the back until 
blood ran. “Shut up or I’ll kill 
you!” 



At this the whole army, 
which hated Thersites, roared 
with laughter. Odysseus had 
relieved the tension ; now they 
were ready to march under 
Agamemnon’s orders. 

Athena sighed with relief 
and radioed back to the ship 
that the Director could be 
awakened. Things were well in 
hand. 

A ND so they were — until a 
few days later when 
Apollo and Hera, waiting un- 
til the Director had gone to 
bed early with a hangover 
from the night before^ induced 
Hector to make a night attack. 
The fighting went on all night, 
and at dawn Patroclos ran in- 
to Achilles’ tent. 

“Terrible news!” he cried. 
“The Trojans have breached 
the walls around our ships and 
are burning them! Diomedes, 
Agamemnon, and Odysseus 
are wounded. If you do not 
lead your men against Hector, 
all is lost!” 

“Too bad,” said Achilles. 
But the blood drained from 
his face. 

“Don’t be so hardhearted!” 
shouted Patroclos. “If you 
won’t fight, at least allow me 
to lead the Myrmidons against 
the enemy. Perhaps we can 
save the ships and drive Hec- 
tor off!” 

Achilles shouted back, 
“Very well! You know I give 
you, my best friend, anything 
you want. But I will not for 
all the gold in the world serve 



82 



PHILIP JOSE FARMER 




under a king who robs me of 
prizes I took with my own 
sword. However, I will give 
you my armor, and my men 
will march behind you!” 

Then, sobbing with rage and 
frustration, he helped Patro- 
clos dress in his armor. 

“Do you see this little lever 
in the back of the shield?” he 
said. “When an enemy strikes 
at you, flick it this way. The 
air in front of you will become 
hard, and your foe’s weapon 
will bounce off the air. Then, 
before he recovers from his 
confusion, flick the lever the 
other way. The air will soften 
and allow your spear to pass. 
And the spearpoint will shear 
through his armor as if it 
were cheese left in the hot sun. 
It is made of some substance 
harder than the hardest 
bronze made by the hand of 
man.” 

“So this is the magic armor 
your divine mother, Thetis, 
gave you,” said Patroclos. “No 
wonder — ” 

“Even without this magic — 
or force field, as Thetis calls it 
— I am the best man among 
Greek or Trojan,” said Achil- 
les matter-of-factly. “There ! 
Now you are almost as mag- 
nificent as I am. Go forth in 
my armor, Patroclos, and run 
the Trojans ragged. I will 
pray to Zeus that you come 
back safely. There is one thing 
you must not do, though, no 
matter how strong the tempta- 
tion — do not chase the Tro- 
jans too close to the city, even 

HEEL 



if you are on the heels of Hec- 
tor himself. Thetis has told me 
that Zeus does not want Troy 
to fall yet. If you were to 
threaten it now, the gods 
would strike you down.” 

“I will remember,” said 
Patroclos. He got into Achil- 
les’ chariot and drove off 
proudly to take his place in 
front of the Myrmidons. 

T HE Director was so red in 
the face, he looked as if his 
head were one huge blood ves- 
sel. 

“How in space did the Tro- 
jans get so far?” he screamed. 
“And what is Patroclos doing 
in Achilles’ armor? There’s 
rank inefficiency here or else 
skullduggery! Either one, 
heads will roll! And I think I 
know whose! Apollo! Hera! 
What have you two been up 
to?” 

“Why, Husband,” said 
Hera, “how can you say I had 
anything to do with this? You 
know how I hate the Trojans. 
As for Apollo, he thinks too 
much of his job to go against 
the Script.” 

“All right, we’ll see. We’ll 
get to the bottom of this later. 
Meanwhile, let’s direct the 
situation so it’ll end up con- 
forming to the Script.” 

But before the cameramen 
and technicians could be or- 
ganized, Patroclos, leading the 
newly inspired Greeks, slaugh- 
tered the Trojans as a lion 
kills sheep. He could not be 
stopped, and when he saw 



83 




Hector running away from 
him, he forgot his friend’s 
warning and pursued him to 
the walls of Troy. 

“Follow me!” yelled Patro- 
clos to the Greeks. “We will 
break down the gates and take 
the city within an hour !” 

I T WAS then Apollo pro- 
jected fury into Hector so 
that he turned to battle the 
man he thought was Achilles. 
And Apollo, timing to coincide 
with the instant that Patroclos 
flicked off his force field, 
struck him a stunning blow 
from behind. At the same time 
a spear thrown by a Trojan 
wounded Patroclos in the back. 
Dazed, hurt, the Greek started 
back toward his men. But Hec- 
tor ran up and stabbed him 
through the belly, finding no 
resistance to his spear because 
Patroclos had not turned the 
force field back on. Patroclos 
hit the ground with a crash of 
armor. 

“No, no, you fool, Apollo!” 
shouted the Director into the 
radio. “He must not die! We 
need him later for the Script. 
You utter fool, you’ve bum- 
bled!” 

Thetis, who had been stand- 
ing behind the Director, burst 
into tears and ran into her 
cabin. 

“What’s the matter with 
her?” asked the Director. 

“You may as well know, 
darling,” said Hera, “that 
your daughter is in love with 
a barbarian.” 



“Thetis? In love with Pa- 
troclos? Impossible!” 

Hera laughed and said, 
“Ask her how she feels about 
the planned death of Achilles. 
That is whom she is weeping 
for, not Patroclos. She fore- 
sees Achilles’ death in his 
friend’s. And I imagine she 
will go to comfort her lover, 
knowing his grief when he 
hears that Patroclos is dead.” 

“That’s ridiculous! If she’s 
in love with Achilles, why 
would she tell Achilles she is 
his mother?” 

“For the very reason she 
loves him but doesn’t want 
him to know. She at least has 
sense enough to realize no 
good could come from a match 
with one of those Earth primi- 
tives. So she stopped any pass- 
es from him with that mater- 
nal bit. If there is one thing 
the Greeks respect, it is the 
incest taboo.” 

“I’ll have him knocked off 
as soon as possible. Thetis 
might lose her head and tell 
him the truth. Poor little girl, 
she’s been away from civiliza- 
tion too long. We’ll have to 
wind up this picture and get 
back to God’s planet.” 

Hera watched him go after 
Thetis and then switched to a 
private channel. “Apollo, the 
Director is very angry with 
you. But I’ve thought of a way 
to smooth his feathers. We’ll 
tell him that killing Patroclos 
was the only way to get Achil- 
les back into the fight. He'll 
like that. Achilles can then be 



84 



PHILIP JOSE FARMER 




slain, and the picture will still 
be saved. Also, I'll make him 
think it was his idea.” 

“That’s great,” replied 
Apollo, his voice shaky with 
dread of the Director. “But 
what can we do to speed up 
the shooting? Patroclos was 
supposed to take the city after 
Achilles was killed.” 

“Don’t worry,” said Athena, 
who had been standing behind 
Hera. “Odysseus is your man. 
He’s been working on a device 
to get into the city. Barbarian 
or not, that fellow is the 
smartest I’ve ever met. Too 
bad he’s an Earthman.” 

D URING the next twenty- 
four hours, Thetis wept 
much. But she was also very 
busy, working while she cried. 
She went to Hephaistos, the 
chief technician, an old man of 
five thousand years. He loved 
Thetis because she had inter- 
vened for Hephaistos more 
than once when her father had 
been angry with him. Yet he 
shook his head when she asked 
him if he could make Achilles 
another suit of armor, even 
more invulnerable than the 
first. 

“Not enough time. Achilles 
is to be killed tomorrow.” 
“No. My father has cooled 
off a little. He remembered 
that the Script calls for Achil- 
les to kill Hector before he 
himself dies. Besides, the gov- 
ernment anthropologist wants 
to take, films of the funeral 
games for Patroclos. And he 



overrules even Father, you 
know.” 

“That’ll give me a week,” 
said Hephaistos, figuring on 
his fingers. “I can do it. But 
tell me, child, why all the 
tears? Is it true what they 
say, that you love a barbarian, 
that magnificent red-haired 
Achilles?” 

“I love him,” she said, 
weeping again. 

“Ah, child, you are a mere 
hundred years or so. When 
you reach my age, you’ll know 
that there are few things 
worth tears, and love between 
man and woman is not one of 
them. However, I’ll make the 
armor. And its field of force 
will cover everything around 
him except an opening to the 
outside air. Otherwise, he’d 
suffocate. But what good will 
all this do? The Director will 
find some means of killing 
him. And even if Achilles 
should escape, you’d be no bet- 
ter off.” 

“I will,” she said. “We’ll go 
to Italy — and I’ll give him 
perpetuol.” 

Thetis went to her cabin. 
Shortly afterward, the door- 
bell rang. She opened the door 
and saw Apollo. 

Smiling, he said, “I have 
something here you might be 
interested in hearing.” He 
held in his hand a small car- 
tridge. 

Seeing it, her eyes widened 
in surprise. 

“Yes, it’s a recording,” he 
said, and he pushed past her 



HEEL 



85 




into the room. “Let me put it 
in your playback.” 

“You don’t have to,” she 
replied. “I presume you had a 
microphone planted in Hepha- 
istos’ cabin?” 

“Correct. Won’t your fa- 
ther be angry if somebody 
sends him a note telling him 
you’re planning to ruin the 
Script by running off to Italy 
with a barbarian? And not 
only that but inject perpetuol 
into the barbarian to increase 
his life span? Personally, if I 
were your father, I’d let you 
do it. You’d soon grow sick of 
your handsome but uncouth 
booby.” 

Thetis did not answer. 

“I really don’t care,” he 
said. “In fact. I’ll help you. I 
can arrange it so the arrow 
that hits Achilles’ heel will be 
a trick one. Its head will just 
seem to sink into his flesh. In- 
side it will be a needle that 
will inject a cataleptic agent. 
Achilles will seem to be dead 
but will actually be in a state 
of suspended animation. We’ll 
sneak his body at night from 
the funeral pyre and substi- 
tute a corpse. A bio-tech who 
owes me a favor will fix up 
the face of a dead Trojan or 
Greek to look like Achilles’. 
When this epic is done and 
we’re ready to leave Earth, 
you can run away. We’ll not 
miss you until we’re light- 
years away.” 

“And what do you want in 
return for arranging all this ? 
My thanks?” 

86 



“I want you." 

Thetis flinched. For a mo- 
ment she stood with her eyes 
closed and her hands clenched. 
Then, opening her eyes, she 
said, “All right. I know that is 
the only way open for me. It’s 
also the only way you could 
have devised to have me. But 
I want to tell you that I loathe 
and despise you. And I’ll be 
hating every atom of your 
flesh while you’re in posses- 
sion of mine.” 

He chuckled and said, “I 
know it. But your hate will 
only make me relish you the 
more. It’ll be the sauce on the 
salad.” 

“Oh, you heel!” she said in 
a trembling voice. “You dirty, 
sneaking, miserable, slimy 
heel!” 

“Agreed.” He picked up a 
bottle and poured two drinks. 
“Shall we toast to that?” 

H ECTOR’S death happened, 
as planned, and the tear- 
jerking scene in which his fa- 
ther, King Priam, came to beg 
his son’s body from Achilles. 
Four days later, Achilles led 
the attack on the Scaian gate. 
It was arranged that Paris 
should be standing on the wall 
above the gate. Apollo, invisi- 
ble behind him, would shoot 
the arrow that would strike 
Achilles’ foot if Paris’ arrow 
bounced off the force field. 

Apollo spoke to Thetis, who 
was standing beside him. 
“You seem very nervous. 
Don’t worry. You’ll see your 



PHILIP JOSE FARMER 




lovely warrior in Italy in a 
few weeks. And you can ex- 
plain to him that you aren’t 
his mother, that you had to 
tell him that to protect him 
from the god Apollo’s jealousy. 
But now that Zeus has raised 
him from the dead, you have 
been given to him as a special 
favor. And all will end happi- 
ly. That is, until living with 
him will become so unbearable 
you’d give a thousand years 
off your life to leave this plan- 
et. Then, of course, it’ll be too 
late. There won’t be another 
ship along for several millen- 
nia.” 

“Shut up,” she said. “I 
know what I’m doing.” 

“So do I,” he said. “Ah, here 
comes the great hero Achilles, 
chasing a poor Trojan whom 
he plans to slaughter. We’ll 
see about that.” 

He lifted the airgun in 
whose barrel lay the long dart 
with the trick head. He took 
careful aim, saying, “I’ll wait 
until he goes to throw his 
spear. His force field will be 
off . Now!” 

Thetis gave a strangled cry. 
Achilles, the arrow sticking 
from the tendon just above the 
heel, had toppled backward 
from the chariot onto the 
plain, where dust settled on 
his shining armor. He lay mo- 
tionless. 

“Oh, that was an awful 
fall.” she moaned. “Perhaps 
he broke his neck. I’d better 



go down there and see if he’s 
all right.” 

“Don’t bother,” said Apollo. 
“He’s dead.” 

Thetis looked at him with 
wide brown eyes set in a gray 
face. 

“I put poison on the needle,” 
said Apollo, smiling crookedly 
at her. “That was my idea, but 
your father approved of it. He 
said I’d redeemed my blunder 
in killing Patroclos by telling 
him what you planned. Of 
course, I didn’t inform him of 
the means you took to insure 
that I would carry out my 
bargain with you. I was afraid 
your father would have been 
very shocked to hear of your 
immoral behavior.” 

Thetis choked out, “You un- 
speakable . vicious ... vi- 
cious . you . you . .” 

“Dry your pretty tears,” 
said Apollo. “It’s all for your 
own good. And for Achilles’, 
too. The story of his brief but 
glorious life will be a legend 
among his people. And out in 
the Galaxy the movie based 
on his career will become the 
most stupendous epic ever 
seen.” 

A POLLO was right. Four 
thousand years later, it 
was still a tremendous box- 
office attraction. There was 
talk that now that Earth was 
civilized enough to have space 
travel, it might even be shown 
there. END

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



M ARY Kornbluth’s Science 
Fiction Showcase (Dou- 
bleday) is partly a memorial 
to her late husband, C. M. 
Kornbluth. But also it is a col- 
lection of excellent stories, 
chosen with care and percep- 
tion. Mary G. Byers was a 
science fiction reader (and 
writer) long before she ever 
heard of Cyril Kornbluth. She 
has some twenty years' ac- 
quaintance with the field; she 
knows a good story when she 
finds one. 

In Science Fiction Showcase 
she gives us stories by Jack 
Williamson, Theodore Stur- 
geon, Ray Bradbury, Murray 
Leinster, Poul Anderson, 
Richard Matheson and half a 
dozen others. Some, like Da- 
mon Knight’s Ticket to Any- 
where and James Blish’s A 
Work of Art y are here pub- 
lished in complete and revised 
form for the first time any- 
where; some, like Robert 
Bloch’s Nightmare Number 
Four , have never been pub- 
lished before at all. 

If you intend to buy only 
one science fiction anthology 
in 1960, Science Fiction Show- 
case is a good choice — but 
the other new anthologies run 
very rich to the ton. Double- 



day also has The World That 
Couldn't Be , edited by H. L. 
Gold and containing (in addi- 
tion to the title story by Clif- 
ford D. Simak) eight other 
fine novelettes from Galaxy 
Magazine . Judith Merril offers 
her selections of the year’s 
best in SF: 59 (Gnome Press 
& Dell). The stories are all 
entertaining and the non-fic- 
tion addenda (notably Isaac 
Asimov’s original article on 
the ill-mannered habit science 
has of catching up with 
science fiction and Daniel 
Lang’s Man in Space) are 
even better. And Groff Conk- 
lin gives us Four for the 
Future (Pyramid), compris- 
ing novelettes by Henry Kutt- 
ner, Theodore Sturgeon, Poul 
Anderson and Eric Frank 
Russell. The Anderson and the 
Russell are first-rate. The 
Sturgeon and Kuttner aren’t. 
But there are treasures in 
even the minor efforts of 
Sturgeon and the late Henry 
Kuttner; they are both sim- 
ply too good ever to be wholly 
bad. 

In Deals with the Devil 
(Ballantine), Basil Davenport 
has selected twelve accounts 
of hellish bargains struck. In 
six of them the man comes out

ahead, in the other six the 
devil collects; so that nothing 
is proved except that Messrs. 
Kuttner, Boucher, Elliott, Col- 
lier, Dunsany and others tell 
uncommonly good stories. 

I N 1958 both Henry Kuttner 
and C. M. Kornbluth died 
and so, a little later on, did 
E. Everett Evans. Evans was 
a friend and admirer of E. E. 
(“Skylark”) Smith, the man 
who opened interstellar space 
to science fiction writers. 
Evans was also a fan, a famil- 
iar figure at science fiction 
conventions and in some way 
an odd one, as he had come to 
science fiction late in life and 
fandom is a population of 
youth. Finally he was, in the 
last years of his life, a 
writer. 

In Man of Many Minds 
(Fantasy Press & Pyramid), 
all of Evans’s facets show 
clearly. The friendship with 
Smith produces junior-grade 
Galactic Patrol (it is called 
the Interstellar Corps, but no 
old Lensman will be deceiv- 
ed). The fannish element gen- 
erates an unfortunately severe 
case of that most common 
problem in the writing of fan- 
turned-pro, the inability to 
leave well enough alone. Not 
content with an Interstellar 
Corpsman for a hero, Evans 
has to turn him into a tele- 
path; not satisfied with mere 
telepathy, he has to give him 
the odd power of dislocating 
his mind at will and parking 



it in the brain of any conven- 
ient animal of low intelli- 
gence. There is also an intelli- 
gent race of plant-creatures 
called Guddus, a Plot to Over- 
throw the Guvmint and heav- 
en knows what else. It is all 
too much. 

A Simak or a van Vogt 
might be able to juggle all the 
marvels in Man of Many 
Minds, but Evans’s fingers 
were not that supple. He was 
able to invent them, but not 
to find a use for them — so 
that, for example, on almost 
the only occasion when the 
hero has any real need for his 
telepathic powers (he must 
establish contact with the 
Guddus, whose spoken lan- 
guage is in the ultrasonic, dog- 
whistle range of frequencies), 
the telepathic communication 
is abandoned almost at once 
in favor of a clumsy, compli- 
cated frequence changer and 
the laborious study of their 
language. 

Yet there is that third thing 
about Evans. He was also a 
writer. When he was able to 
free himself of the heritage 
of fandom and the all-but- 
Boskonian enemy, he made 
some plausible and telling 
points. It is really very much 
too bad that Evans began 
writing science -fiction only 
when he was in his fifties. An 
earlier start and a few more 
years could easily have pro- 
duced something well worth 
while. 

This is not to say, however,

that reading Mem of Many 
Minds is all enjoyment — not 
with passages like this : 

Hanlon threw back his head 
in a gesture of pride . “I'm glad 
I did it. To be able to free those 
fine Guddus from slavery, and to 
save the Federation from that hor- 
rible plot — it was well worth the 
little suffering it'll cost me. But,” 
and his smile was pathetic, “I do 
miss the uniform. I was so proud, 
wearing it.” 

This is the man who has 
just most bloodily killed a 
number of opponents and 
conducted the fiercest fought 
space war within the scope of 
this book. He is then given 
a set of captain’s bars to make 
up for his “little suffering.” 

Two other aspirants to the 
mantle of E. E. Smith appear, 
conveniently bound together 
in a single volume. They are 
Robert Silverberg’s The Plan- 
et Killers and Poul Anderson’ s 
We Claim These Stars! (Ace 
Double Volume). Both stories 
owe a debt to Smith; both 
have to do with an interstellar 
civilization centered on Earth 
and the troubles involved in 
keeping it going against the 
best efforts of extra-solar 
enemies; both make use of 
cloak-and-dagger intrigue and 
flamboyant sets. There the re- 
semblance stops. In one story 
you have care, thought, precis- 
ion and an economy of con- 
struction which invents lavish 
details and makes fine use of 
every one. The other is purest 
Perils of Pauline. This is 



really a gambler’s volume, 
suitable for flipping and call- 
ing like a coin : Anderson you 
win, Silverberg you lose. 

R EX Gordon’s First to the 
Stars (Ace) is a queer 
sort of novel. It is loaded with 
shoddy fake-suspense tricks 
and weirdly unlikely astro- 
physical detail, and surely its 
wailing first-person prose is a 
bore. But the man seems to 
have something to say. Gor- 
don is capable of having his 
narrator refer to his space- 
traveling companion as “E” 
(not even the courtesy of a 
period after the initial!) for 
a page or two in order to at- 
tempt to titivate the reader’s 
interest, before revealing that 
“E” is only “Elvinia” and the 
big surprise is that she turns 
out to be a girl. He is capable 
of asking the reader to believe 
that an interstellar rocket, 
careening wildly out of con- 
trol through the emptiest 
space in the Galaxy, just sort 
of happens to collide with a 
planet — not only that, an 
Earthlike planet capable of 
sustaining life — not only that, 
but in the resulting collision 
nobody is killed, or even very 
badly banged up He is capable 
of endless incredibilities; and 
yet he is capable, too, of tell- 
ing a story that moves and 
excites. 

In The Sea People (Ava- 
lon), Adam Lukens produces 
a book just as queerly uneven 
as First to the Stars. Lukens’

imagination can operate on as 
infantile a level as devising 
such “alien” names for bev- 
erages as “cinot”, a non-intox- 
icating drink made from 
pressed oysters, and “yeksic” 
— surely a misprint for “yek- 
sihw”! — a joy-juice squeezed 
out of jungle fruit. Yet that 
same imagination is subtle 
enough to conjure up a sym- 
pathetic and detailed race of 
iishlike aliens in which the 
oldest members are grown de- 
tached and enormous, so that 
they are the one important 
natural enemy of their jun- 
iors. Is this a master-stroke 
of invention? No, unfortu- 
nately not, for even the great- 
est inspiration comes to 
nothing if it is not surround- 
ed by great and patiently con- 
trived detail. But in a very 
good book this would be a very 
good idea indeed. In The 
Sea People it is only surpris- 
ing. 

Martin Gardner is a con- 
tinuously reliable source of 
first-class books on scientific 
themes for the lay reader. 
Logic Machines and Diagrams 
(McGraw-Hill) traces the 
history of man’s long-term en- 
deavor to carry on part of his 
thinking process indepen- 
dently of the built-in compu- 
ter within the skull. Ramon 
Lull’s 13th century experi- 
ments in rotating wheels 
bearing propositions in logic, 
Lewis Carroll’s 19th century 
“Game of Logic” and scores 
of other systems are describ- 



ed and amply discussed. So 
are some of the ingenious and 
baffling mechanical and elec- 
trical machines devised for 
the same purpose. 

Having detailed the results 
of eight centuries of develop- 
ment, Gardner then reveals 
his own newly developed No- 
tational System for symbolic 
logic. As we would expect 
from him, it is thorough, 
clear and complete. He then 
adds an 1894 quotation from 
the Reverend John Venn, he 
of the Venn Diagrams, so that 
we may not think the interest 
in this subject is tainted by 
any conceivable practical ap- 
plication : 

I have no high estimate myself 
of the interest or importance of 
what are sometimes called logical 
machines ... It is very seldom 
that intricate logical calculations 
are practically forced upon us; it 
is rather we who look about for 
complicated examples in order to 
illustrate our rules and methods. 

A great work on an ex- 
tremely important but dis- 
mayingly difficult subject is 
Godel’s Proof, by Ernest Na- 
gel and James R. Newman 
(New York University 
Press). Nearly thirty years 
ago Kurt Godel, a 25-year-old 
mathematician at the Univer- 
sity of Vienna (now at 
Princeton’s Institute for Ad- 
vanced Studies), published a 
paper on formally undecidable 
mathematical propositions. 
The mathematical world has 
spent the intervening decades

comprehending what Godel 
wrote. “Godel,” Messrs. Nagel 
and Newman tell us, “present- 
ed mathematicians with the 
astounding and melancholy 
conclusion that the axiomatic 
method has certain inherent 
limitations, which rule out the 
possibility that even the or- 
dinary arithmetic of the in- 
tegers can ever be fully 
axiomatized.” As predomi- 
nant modern philosophies of 
mathematics rely heavily on 
the axiomatic method, Godel 
thus told mathematicians that 
their methods were and al- 
ways would be inadequate to 
describe their own processes. 

I T IS not unusual for the 
paperbound edition of a 
book to be shortened, but that 
master of paradox, Robert 
Sheckley, has given us one of 
the very few cases of a paper- 
bound edition revised, retitled 
and quite a good deal length- 
ened from its hard-cover ap- 
pearance. The book is 
Immortality, Inc. (Bantam), 
previously Immortality De- 
livered (Avalon), and, more 
previously still, a Galaxy 
Magazine serial under the 
title of Time Killers — in still 
a third version. Several of to- 
morrow’s doctoral degrees in 
Comp. Engl. Lit. may await 
those who have the patience 
to compare and analyze the 
variorum editions. But the 
casual reader will find in any 
one of them Sheckley’s habit- 
ual skill plus an unusually 

92 



challenging theme — a world 
in which survival after death 
is available to all, for a price. 

John Brunner’s The World 
Swappers (Ace) involves a 
secret society of humanity- 
servers who gadfly the stag- 
nant race of man into expan- 
sion and progress by various 
spy-and-saboteur stratagems. 
This one is very enjoyable, 
very competent and very like 
van Vogt. In case you doubt 
this, you need only flip the 
double volume over to find van 
Vogt’s Siege of the Unseen 
for comparison. This remark- 
able story contains what in 
this reviewer’s opinion is the 
all-time high in ridiculousness 
of “scientific background” — 
viz., a method of interdimen- 
sional travel which is accom- 
plished through use of the 
Bates system of eye training. 

A much more attractive van 
Vogt is The War Against the 
Rull (Simon & Schuster), 
which is five novelettes very 
skillfully cut and patched into 
the semblance of a novel. As 
the principal characters are 
impenetrably non-human, van 
Vogt’s sympathies are excited 
and he makes them interest- 
ing, formidable and well 
worth reading about. Each 
story is the account of one 
battle in man’s interminable 
war against his competitors 
for supremacy in space, the 
light-controlling, voracious, 
powerful and hateful Rulls. 

It is on record that John 
Christopher’s opinion of sci- 

FREDERIK POHL 




ence fiction is low, but that 
has not kept him from con- 
tributing to it a number of 
very succesful stories and a 
number of very good ones. 
(Not necessarily the same 
stories.) Planet in Peril 
(Avon) is one of the good 
ones. It is Christopher's con- 
tention here that capitalism 
will indeed be buried, but not 
by any Marxist Messiah. A 
managerial state will replace 
capitalism and communism 
alike. Great trusts will vie for 
the minds and loyalties of 
men ; Communications will 
have its spies in Atomics, and 
Agriculture will fight Chemi- 
cals with guns as well as with 
market monopolies. 

In The Outward Urge 
(Ballantine), John Wyndham 
and Lucas Parkes chronicle 
four generations in the Troon 
family history, all of them 
pioneers, all of them destined 
to push mankind one step far- 
ther out into space. 

We Who Survived (Avon) 
is by Sterling Noel, more oft- 
en thought of as a craftsman 
in the mystery-suspense field. 
This is the story of the fifth 
Ice Age, when the snow be- 
gan one day and never stop- 
ped. Even the greatest sky- 
scrapers are buried, and only 
a narrow belt around the 
Equator remains capable of 
producing food for the few 
thousands who are able to 
survive the endless blizzard. 
The problem is survival; the 
solution makes good reading. 



Another offering by a mys- 
tery specialist is Cornell 
Woolrich's Beyond the Night 
(Avon), a short-story collec- 
tion containing six retellings 
of weary fantasy themes. 

The Man Who CouM Cheat 
Death (Avon) does so by 
transplanting the uter-para- 
thyroid glands of innocents 
into his own body. The what 
glands? The uter-parathyroid 
glands, and don't ask so many 
questions* As this in time 
makes him glow with a ghast- 
ly green radiance, and besides 
involves him in a number of 
murders, society has got to 
track him down and blow his 
head off, and it does. Barre 
Lyndon and Jimmie Sangster 
wrote this. It is to be made 
into a movie, which accounts 
for the ghastly green radiance, 
but what accounts for the rest 
of this 160 -page dose of silli- 
ness? 

In The Dark Destroyers 
(Avalon), Manly Wade Well- 
man sends an invasion of Cold 
People against the reeling 
Earth, but provides a hero 
named Mark Darragh to beat 
their jellylike heads in, so that 
everything comes out all right. 
Well, almost all right. In an 
epilogue, Mark Darragh's 
great-grandson is quoted as 
saying, “Maybe, in the final 
analysis, my great-grandpa 
was the most devastating bore 
in the history of the uni- 
verse." The boy shows a lot 
of discernment. Great-grand- 
pa very nearly was. END

B RIDGET Kelly stood at the ed, and now it was the pas- 
foot of the rocket lift and sengers’ turn. Bridget was 
watched the loading opera- glad that for once she was not 
tion. The freight had long responsible. Let others worry 
since been inspected and stow- and snoop. This time she was

By A. M. LIGHTNER 

Watchdogs have to be watched 

or they keep everything out 
— including our friends! 





a passenger herself, starward 
bound. Inspected, passed and 
okayed, she could have the 
pleasure of watching others 
squirm. 

Like that beauty coming 
aboard with the furs and the 
orchid. She wouldn't be al- 
lowed to keep the orchid, of 
course. Bridget grinned as 
she saw the flower tossed 
into a trash can and im- 
agined the words the beau- 
ty was mouthing. The man 
beside her sported a bouton- 
niere. Yes, there it went into 
the can. He was still smiling, 
probably cracking wise. Brid- 
get had separated so many 
travelers from so many items 
that she could tell what the 
passenger was going to say 
before he said it. 

Most people knew that 
strenuous efforts were being 
made to keep pests and epi- 
demics away from Earth. 
Ever since the beginnings of 
space travel, the quarantine 
of incoming ships at the Moon 
had been rigidly observed. 
But the fact that plagues 
could also spread from Earth 
seldom registered on the pub- 
lic's mind. 

Bridget was all too well 
aware of it. For several years 
she had labored to that end in 
the Quarantine Service. Now 
that her savings had accu- 
mulated and her abilities as an 
entomologist were recognized, 
she was about to board one of 
the shining ships herself. 
There were raised eyebrows 



when her destination was 
known. An entomologist go- 
ing to New Eden — a planet 
where insects were at a mini- 
mum. But Bridget only smiled. 
She knew what she wanted. 
She was bound for the fron- 
tier, where men are men and 
women are scarce. 

The speaker blared. The 
countdown was beginning. 

“Fifteen minutes!" rasped 
the mechanical voice. “Fifteen 
minutes to blast-off !" 

S HE took a last look at the 
planet of her birth and 
squeezed into the lift. The few 
remaining passengers pushed 
in with her. A man in a red 
waistcoat was commiserating 
with the woman beside him. 

“Don't let the officials get 
you down," he said. “We'll 
have to put up with them for 
the journey. But on New 
Eden, I hear, the conditions 
are so good they hardly need 
any regulations at all." 

“It isn't that," sniffed his 
friend. “It's just that you 
gave it to me and I was hop- 
ing to wear it tonight." 

“Perhaps I can buy you 
something in hydroponics. I 
had no idea they were so 
touchy or I'd have had the 
orchid fumigated." 

Bridget felt the scorn of 
the official for the general 
public. “If you're going to 
New Eden, you ought to know 
we want to keep it that way." 

The red waistcoat looked 
down at her. 



A GREAT DAY FOR THE IRISH

“Oh, officialdom without 
stripes?” he said. “Or are 
you an old hand? Perhaps you 
can explain the deal before 
we get there.” 

So he was the type that 
cracked wise, and she had put 
her foot in it right at the be- 
ginning. 

“I've never been off Earth 
before,” she admitted. “I read 
up on it all first.” 

The lift was at the lock 
door, and she slipped through 
without looking back. The 
speaker was croaking “Ten 
minutes to go” as she hurried 
to her cabin and prepared for 
takeoff. She'd have to do bet- 
ter than this or the trip would 
be a washout. Better just con- 
centrate on enjoying it . the 
new experiences . the fas- 
cination of travel. 

The jets roared and Bridget 
Kelly blacked out. 

Several hours later she had 
recovered enough to spruce 
up, take the prescribed dose 
of covitron against space sick- 
ness, and make her way to the 
lounge. She found the table 
setting with her name on it 
and had hardly sat down be- 
fore a familiar voice began at 
her ear. 

“Sure and if it isn't Brid- 
get Kelly, and it's a long time 
I've been waiting for herself.” 
She looked up into the same 
laughing eyes, only this time 
they were above an emerald- 
green waistcoat. 

“Still determined that New 
Eden shall not be polluted by 

96 



snakes? Oh, excuse me, that 
was St. Patrick. You're wor- 
ried about bugs.” 

She laughed in spite of her- 
self and glanced at the place 
card next hers. “Mr. Patch 
Maguire,” it read. 

“I didn't mean to sound 
stuffy,” she said. “It's just 
that most people don't realize 
how important it is . how 
much trouble just a few in- 
sects . well, I've worked at 
it and I ought to know.” 

“Ah, an official entomolo- 
gist. But in that case, why 
New Eden? Or are you insur- 
ance against people like Car- 
rie and me who might import 
something?” 

“You never can tell. Some- 
thing may turn up. It's hard 
to imagine a planet without 
any insects at all.” 

“Eden's remarkable that 
way,” put in the young officer 
sitting across from them. “No 
stinging bugs or parasites. 
Makes everything a lot more 
comfortable. Still, it's pretty 
new. Only a small part de- 
veloped so far.” 

“So we've insurance against 
the unknown in Bridget 
Kelly.” 

“And what might you be 
insurance against, Mr. Ma- 
guire?” she countered. 

T HE officer stared. “Don’t 
you folks know each oth- 
er? Mr. Maguire's a grower 
of fancy plants. Sort of goes 
together . plants and in- 
sects!” He laughed. “Well, it 



A. M. LIGHTNER 




looks like the rest of our ta- 
ble won’t show up for this 
meal.” 

“What happened to the lady 
without the orchid? She was 
with you, wasn’t she?” Brid- 
get asked. 

“Carrie,” said Patch Ma- 
guire, “is one of those unfor- 
tunates on whom covitron does 
not work. She won’t be with 
anyone for the duration. I 
was just hoping our whole 
table was not similarly af- 
flicted.” 

“It’s a pity,” mused the 
young officer. “So many peo- 
ple make the flight across 
space only once. If they did it 
more often, they might get ac- 
customed.” 

“Don’t you take covitron?” 
Bridget asked, beginning to 
wonder how soon she should 
repeat the dose. Some people 
said it made you sleepy, and 
she certainly didn’t want that 
with things just getting start- 
ed .. and Patch Maguire . 
Patch Maguire . 

Suddenly a window opened 
in her mind. She saw a letter 
with short punching sentences. 
“You think you can get away 
with this high-handed, over- 
bearing, totally uncalled-for 
destruction of property? I’ll 
take it to the top ! I’ll see you 
idiots in hell ... or at least 
out of the Service!” Patch 
Maguire protesting the des- 
truction of his shipment of 
seeds imported from Regulus 
V. No amount of explanation 
that the seeds had been found 

A GREAT DAY FOR THE IRISH 



to harbor a blight which, once 
let loose on Earth . Patch 
Maguire had a reputation as 
an authority on crossbreeding 
and mutation of plants . 
and also for throwing his 
weight around. It was several 
years ago, but Bridget re- 
membered the consternation 
in the department. 

She realized that Maguire 
and the officer were talking. 
They were agreeing that 
space sickness was only a 
matter of psychology, and 
that if you just didn’t think 
about it, no covitron was nec- 
essary. She hastily swallowed 
another pill with her coffee 
and hoped the coffee would 
keep her awake. 

They toured the ship togeth- 
er, she and Patch. They mar- 
veled at the scene from the 
viewport and chatted with the 
captain in the control room. 
The steward inquired about 
his taste in music and stereo, 
and he even gave advice to the 
gardeners in hydroponics. All 
doors were open to Patch, and 
there were murmurs about the 
“handsome couple” as they 
moved through the lounge. By 
the end of the trip they were 
making plans for New Eden. 
Patch insisted that Bridget 
was in the wrong profession 
and she agreed that the sci- 
ence of agriculture might be 
more rewarding than ento- 
mology under certain condi- 
tions. 

At the farewell dinner. 
Patch gave her a bouquet he’d 

97 




had made up especially by the 
gardeners. But she was more 
interested in the small green 
leaf he wore in his lapel. He 
took it out and insisted on 
fastening it in her hair. 

“Sure and it’s a shamrock !” 
he cried, as he arranged it. 
“And have you forgotten 
what day it is tomorrow?” 
“It’s the day we land,” 
Bridget replied. “But what 
day that is in our time or 
ship’s time . it’s too con- 
fusing !” 

“It’s St. Patrick’s Day, 
that’s what it is!” he said. “A 
great day for the Irish and a 
great day for us. And I would- 
n’t be without the shamrock 
on St. Patrick’s Day ! They 
should call the planet New 
Ireland, that they should. 
Wasn’t Ireland the garden is- 
land, all green and fruitful 
and with no snakes? And I 
hear this planet’s the garden 
planet and with no insects 
either to make life miserable. 
But let you and me be living 
there a while and we’ll make 
it New Ireland for sure !” 

And he planted a kiss on 
her mouth without a thought 
of who was looking at them. 

A S THEIR tablemates drank 
their health, Bridget 
blushed and her eyes shone, 
and after dinner Patch escort- 
ed her to the stereo where 
they sat very close together 
in the dark. But as the pic- 
tures flashed across the screen 
and as Patch’s arm went 

98 



across her shoulder and drew 
her close, her mind was be- 
sieged by an army of little 
doubts. Shamrock . sham- 
rock . what had she read 
about the shamrock? 

“Patch,” she whispered. 
“Where did you get it?” 

“Get what?” Patch mur- 
mured, bending over to kiss 
her. 

“The shamrock, Patch? I 
don’t believe they have it in 
hydroponics.” 

“Sure, they must have it.” 
Patch’s lips brushed hers and 
she found it difficult to think 
clearly. 

“I never saw it there. 
Patch! Are you sure?” 

“Saw what? I don’t see any- 
thing but you. That’s enough 
for me.” 

“About the shamrock, 
Patch!” 

“It looks beautiful on you. 
Sure and I wouldn’t be with- 
out a shamrock on St. Pa- 
trick’s Day.” 

Bridget gave up. She lay 
back in the sanctuary of his 
arm and basked in the warm 
feeling of his lips on her 
hair. But the doubts kept 
crawling about in her mind. 
What was the matter with 
her? Couldn’t she be happy 
when everything was perfect? 
Had she been a cut-and-dried 
inspector for too many years? 
But she remembered the 
words of Professor Schwarz- 
kopf, the day she re- 
ceived her degree: “The in- 
spectors are the watchdogs 



A. M. LIGHTNER 




of the planets. Without them, 
all that man has built can be 
destroyed.” 

When Patch had kissed her 
good night outside her cabin 
and his footsteps had died 
away along the corridor, she 
crept out into the passage and 
made her way to hydroponics. 

“Why, no,” said the chief 
gardener, “we never carry 
clover of any sort. Why do 
you ask?” 

On her way to the control 
room, Bridget tried not to 
think. She found the young 
officer from her table on duty 
with the captain, and the two 
men listened in surprise as 
she outlined her fears. 

“I don't want to accuse Mr. 
Maguire of anything,” she 
said. “I'm sure he doesn't 
realize how serious — and of 
course there may be nothing 
to it. It's just that I remem- 
ber that shamrocks harbor 
the golden nematode — that is, 
in the soil around the roots. 
And it seems likely that if 
Mr. Maguire has live sham- 
rocks — and I remember what 
a serious plague they once 
brought over from Ireland to 
America ...” 

The captain pulled his mus- 
tache. “It's clearly against 
regulations. I can't imagine 
how he'd get it past inspec- 
tion. But then, Maguire's a 
very persistent man and he's 
got pull in odd places. I 
don't want to rouse the ire 
of the Irish, but I see your 
point.” 

A GREAT DAY FOR THE IRISH 



“Couldn't you search his 
cabin — without his knowing 
I said to? Oh, I'm sure he'd 
be very angry. But if I could 
only look at his plants, then 
I'd be sure if they're safe. 
You must have ways of get- 
ting in — if there should be a 
short circuit or something in 
his cabin.” 

“Oh, we have ways,” the 
captain said. “Don't we, Lieu- 
tenant?” 

“Perhaps at breakfast,” 
suggested the young officer. 
“If Miss Kelly could arrange 
to make it as leisurely as pos- 
sible.” 

“And right afterward you 
might go to the lieutenant's 
cabin — with your instruments 
and without Mr. Maguire.” 

S HE had no trouble in mak- 
ing her breakfast leisure- 
ly. She could hardly choke it 
down. Under Patch's admir- 
ing gaze and flagrant approval 
she was uncomfortably con- 
scious of treachery. She left 
as soon as the protracted meal 
was over, even though she 
knew it would give him the 
opportunity to discover the 
rape of his plants. 

The lieutenant was waiting 
for her in his cabin. He sat be- 
hind his desk eyeing a motley 
collection of clover in an as- 
sortment of little jars and 
boxes. Bridget brought out 
her pocket 'scope and without 
a word pulled the first speci- 
men up by the roots and be- 
gan to examine it. The lieu- 



99 




tenant watched in fascination. 

“It’s a good thing Mr. Ma- 
guire can’t see you now,” he 
said. “He’d take an entirely 
different tone from the one 
I’ve been hearing lately.” 
“I’m hoping he doesn’t find 
out,” she muttered. “What he 
doesn’t know ... Oh! Oh! 
Look here! A fine big cyst! 
Now if they’re all like this . 

The lieutenant’s face took 
on a look of respect. He came 
around from behind his desk 
and peered over her shoulder. 
“Found something already?” 
he asked. 

Bridget pushed the scope 
under his nose. “See that?” 
she said. “In the right-hand 
corner.” 

“You mean that lump? 
Doesn’t look very dangerous.” 
“No, it doesn’t. But it’s a 
nematode cyst, all right. That 
little brown lump, if turned 
loose in the soil — give it a few 
years and you’ll have a real 
pest on your hands.” 

“You don’t say. We’d better 
get rid of it right away. Do 
you think there’s any more?” 
“That’s just what I’m going 
to find out.” 

But before she could move 
to the desk for the other con- 
tainers there was a sound of 
scuffling outside, the door was 
flung violently open, and a 
rich, Irish voice proclaimed in 
righteous anger : “So here you 
are, conspiring against me! 
Both the culprits red-handed ! 
And my shamrocks, my little 
plants, my babies ! Thank 

100 



heavens I got here in time!” 
The lieutenant moved to in- 
tercept him. “I beg your par- 
don, sir, but these plants are 
in quarantine, and if you have 
any others we haven’t 
found—” 

“You’re no true daughter 
of Ireland, Bridget Kelly. And 
I’m fortunate to have found 
you out in time, false and 
faithless as you are!” 

“Now, now,” cautioned the 
lieutenant, getting between 
Maguire and the desk. “She 
was only doing her duty. You 
should see the things she’s 
been showing me in her mi- 
croscope. A menace to the 
whole planet!” 

“Don’t you believe a word 
of it!” thundered Maguire. 
“These inspectors are full of 
fears and fancies. Puffed up 
with their own importance. 
And I’ll thank you to give me 
back my plants that you stole 
out of my cabin.” 

“I’m afraid I can’t do that,” 
the lieutenant said. “Not until 
Miss Kelly has examined each 
one — and then only the ones 
that get a clean bill of health.” 
And he began to collect the 
little pots and remove them 
as far as possible from Ma- 
guire’s reach. 

“Well, come along then, 
Bridget — give them the bill 
of health,” Maguire ordered. 
“You’ll do that for me, I’m 
sure. And I don’t know what 
all the fuss is about either, 
all over a few little plants, 
and shamrocks at that.”

“The few little plants have 
a few little cysts all through 
their roots,” said Bridget, 
whose temper was wearing 
thin. “I've only looked at one 
so far, but as nice an infesta- 
tion of the golden nematode 
Tve seldom seen. It's got to 
go down the incinerator.” 
“The incinerator!” scream- 
ed Maguire. “Woman! My 
shamrocks! All the way from 
Ireland!” 

“If you hadn't spent your 
whole life circumventing reg- 
ulations and pulling wires, 
this wouldn't have happened. 
Why didn't you get them- 
treated and certified before 
coming aboard?” 

U T>ECAUSE there wasn't 
" time, that's why!” Patch 
shouted. “They only came from 
Ireland as I was leaving for 
the ship. If it hadn't been for 
a snooping, sniveling worry- 
wart — all about a worm that 
you can't even see . .” 

“You can see the results 
right enough !” Bridget's voice 
was rising to match his. “Did 
you ever hear of the Long 
Island potato? The best on the 
East Coast they were. The 
golden nematode ruined Long 
Island for potatoes. That's 
what the shamrock did for 
America! That's a sneaking, 
treacherous worm for you !” 
“And who would want to 
grow potatoes on Long Island, 
built up into a city as it is?” 
“They're going to want to 
grow potatoes on New Eden, 

A GREAT DAY FOR THE IRISH 



and I’m here to see they can.” 
“If that's all that's worry- 
ing you, I'll breed you a nem- 
atode-resistant potato. And 
now I'll thank you to let me 
take my shamrocks and make 
an end to this disgraceful 
scene.” 

But when he looked around, 
he found the lieutenant had 
quietly removed himself with 
the plants, and the door of the 
cabin was crowded with inter- 
ested passengers. 

“So you think you've put 
one over on me!” Patch shout- 
ed. “It's a good thing I found 
out in time how I was being 
deceived by a pair of eyes and 
a mouth that says one thing 
and means another !” 

“And I suppose you're the 
soul of honor! With no 
thought of responsibility to 
your fellow man ! You've had 
your way all your life, and it's 
lucky I found that out, too — 
before — before . .” 

But he was gone, elbowing 
his way through the crowd, 
and the onlookers drifted 
away, embarrassed at the 
sight of the stormy girl who 
shouted hysterically after 
him. Bridget slammed the 
door and collapsed into a 
chair. 

“I'm sorry for the noise,” 
she apologized when the of- 
ficer returned. “I'd better fin- 
ish checking the plants before 
it's time to land.” 

“Never mind the plants,” 
the lieutenant told her. “I've 
put them where he won't find 

101 




them in a hurry. As a matter 
of fact, we aren't going to 
land. We're in orbit now and 
they're to send a rocket shut- 
tle. They aren't worried about 
what we're bringing in this 
time. It's what we might take 
out. There's a howling plague 
on New Eden after all. Sev- 
eral of our passengers have 
changed their minds about 
landing." 

“A plague?" said Bridget 
stupidly. It was hard to con- 
centrate on anything more 
deadly than the golden nem- 
atode. 

“Oh, nothing you or I 
could catch. Something to do 
with agriculture and the 
plants. Which reminds me, 
I've a batch of telegrams for 
you. The authorities are de- 
lighted to learn we’ve a reg- 
istered entomologist aboard. 
Very few of them have come 
this way." 

By the time Bridget had 
read the sheaf of papers, she 
had made the transition from 
the world of shipboard ro- 
mance to her accustomed 
world of science and order. 
There was work to be done. 
Her talents were needed in a 
dozen places at once. She left 
orders for the confiscated 
clovers to be destroyed and 
went to her cabin to pack. 
She was on the first shuttle 
to leave the ship. 

T HE weeks that followed 
were filled with hard work 
with test tube and microscope, 

102 



at her desk and in the field. 
The majority of her co-work- 
ers were men, but none had 
time to look for a laughing 
eye or a smiling mouth. The 
beautiful garden planet of New 
Eden was being reduced to a 
desert by a mysterious some - 
thing that was swiftly attack- 
ing all the cultivated areas. 
Starvation was looming and 
there was talk of hasty evac- 
uation. The situation was 
passing out of control. 

The villain could not be iso- 
lated. Was it an insect, a 
virus, a chemical in the soil? 
Some of the few native insects 
were caught and subjected to 
experiment. The soils were 
analyzed and tested. Those 
were not the answer. The only 
thing certain was that the 
previously lush brown loam 
was turning to a yellow, 
chalky sand, and everything 
that grew in it withered and 
died. 

Bridget visited farm after 
farm and trudged from field 
to field. She looked at wor- 
ried faces and tried to think 
of words of encouragement. 
Back at the laboratory she 
studied her specimens far into 
the night and fell asleep at 
her desk. She was too tired 
to think about Patch Maguire, 
who, she concluded, had never 
left the spaceship. What would 
a grower of gardens, a breed- 
er of plants do in a spread- 
ing desert? He had gone on 
to some more flourishing plan- 
et. 



A. M. LIGHTNER 




She was called to the office 
one day. 

“I hear there’s a farm that 
claims they don’t have the 
plague,” said the harassed 
young scientist behind the 
desk. “Better get over there 
and see if it’s any more than 
a rumor. Take the heli and 
bring back all the usual sam- 
ples. Here’s the directions on 
getting there.” 

He shoved a torn piece of 
paper at her and turned back 
to his cluttered desk. Bridget 
picked up her collecting kit 
and climbed into the cab of 
the machine. By this time she 
knew her way about the set- 
tlements. Without doubt, she 
told herself, this farm was on 
the outskirts of civilization, in 
some valley as yet untouched 
by the plague. But long before 
she reached the limits of cul- 
tivated land, she could see her 
destination. It stood out like 
an oasis in the desert, a little 
patch of green between a 
dried-up cornfield and an ex- 
panse of stricken wheat. 

Bridget brought her heli 
down on a velvety lawn in 
front of a small cottage and 
walked, unbelieving, to the 
door. A shout from within 
welcomed her and she entered 
a clean and simple kitchen- 
parlor. The owner of the one 
healthy farm in New Eden was 
busy in the attached green- 
house. 

As she glimpsed the red 
waistcoat dangling from a 
hook, Bridget screamed, and 

A GREAT DAY FOR THE IRISH 



Patch Maguire came through 
the greenhouse door, a flower 
pot in one hand, trowel in 
the other. 

“And if it isn’t the worm- 
hunter herself!” he cried. 
“The czar of the spaceways! 
The dandelion dictator! And 
I was wondering how long it 
would take you to find me 
out.” 

“But you — ” she gasped. 
“You couldn’t — you wouldn’t 
— aren’t supposed to be here !” 
“And why not?” he coun- 
tered. “I’m not like Carrie, 
she’d rather go on too sick 
to eat in space than face star- 
vation on this planet. And 
then the bargain I was offered 
for this place — you wouldn’t 
believe it ! All modern conven- 
iences and they were practi- 
cally giving it away. Besides, 
what had I to fear with 
the best entomologist in five 
solar systems working for the 
Department of Agriculture? 
Sure, you’ll be having the 
problem solved in no time !” 
“Don’t be giving me that 
blarney!” Bridget said. “You 
need only look out the window 
to know we’ve solved nothing 
at all. And you sitting here 
crowing to yourself! You’ve 
been breeding plague-resist- 
ant plants, that’s what you’ve 
done, and keeping them all to 
yourself! It’s a disgrace!” 
Patch began to laugh, and 
the more he laughed, the 
angrier Bridget got. 

“You should be ashamed!” 
she shouted. “The whole plan- 

103 




et dying and you sitting here 
growing greener all the time !" 

“And that's the way it's 
been," he assured her. “This 
place was dying on me, too. 
But only the last few days it's 
taken a new lease and I'm at 
my wit's end to explain it." 

“You mean you don't want 
to explain it. You're hoarding 
the secret, and it's a shameful 
thing!" 

“Woman, you're crazy!" he 
bellowed at her. “I'm no ma- 
gician to breed a plague-re- 
sistant plant overnight. It 
takes patience and many 
seasons, and I've only just set- 
tled in. I put a few things in 
the garden and stirred things 
up in the potting shed. Here, 
come along — you can see for 
yourself." 

H E DREW her through the 
cottage, pointing out the 
advantages of the kitchen so 
near the greenhouse. She 
walked about the paths and 
felt of the rich brown soil 
without a streak of yellow, 
and finally her eyes fell upon 
some little low leaves by the 
back step. 

“Patch," she demanded, 
“what's that?" 

“You've the eagle eye, to 
be sure. What do you suppose 
it is?" 

“It's clover," she said. 
“Shamrock to you. Surely not 
the same shamrock! I gave 
strict orders!" 

Before he could stop her, 
she had tugged a plant up by 



the roots and pulled out her 
pocket microscope as she bent 
over it. 

“Sure, they were so busy 
worrying about the plague 
here, they forgot all about the 
little plague from Earth. And 
all I wanted was a bit of old 
Ireland to bring with me. A 
few little cysts couldn't be 
that important. And you've 
got to admit that's what I've 
got — a green island!" 

“The idiots!" screamed 
Bridget. “The irresponsible, 
shirking, doublefaced — " 

Her hand went up and 
Patch dodged involuntarily, 
expecting her to throw sham- 
rock, dirt and all right at his 
head. But her hand stopped 
in midair. 

“Patch!" Her voice fell to 
a whisper of incredulity. “I 
think I've got the answer here 
in my hand. Don't say a word 
till I'm sure, but get me soil 
samples from all over your 
place — there — and over there 
— and hurry!” 

Patch ran back and forth 
with the soil samples and 
Bridget looked in her micro- 
scope, and everywhere the 
golden nematode was teem- 
ing and nowhere was there a 
sign of the sinister yellow 
streaks 

“Don't you see?" Bridget 
said. “Whatever it is, the nem- 
atodes are killing it." 

“It will take some experi- 
menting to prove it, but Brid- 
get, my girl, I believe you're 
right." 



104 



A. M. LIGHTNER 




"And while they're proving 
it, Patch, you and I are going 
to breed nematodes right 
here.” 

And she had a vision of the 
golden horde, burrowing from 
Patch's land in all directions, 
bringing back health and san- 
ity to the land. Whatever 
would Professor Schwarzkopf 
say? Dear Professor Schwarz- 
kopf! Sometimes the watch- 



dogs are too faithful. They 
keep out everyone — even our 
friends. 

And that was how New 
Eden was saved. And the nem- 
atodes prospered and the 
Maguires prospered and the 
shamrocks grew everywhere. 
And so there was nothing for 
it but to call the planet New 
Ireland. 

END 



BECAUSE IT’S THERE? 

The conquest of Mount Everest was both an achievement and a major 
letdown for mountain-climbers. The highest mountain on Earth had been 
climbed, leaving only lesser goals to be won. 

But Everest is just a foothill compared with the mountains in the sea! 

The greatest slope in the world is the stretch from the bottom of the 
Peru-Chile Trench (on the bed of the Pacific just west of South America) 
straight up the continental shelf, the littoral and on up to the peaks of 
the Andes. 

Little old Everest is merely a skimpy 29,028 feet, whereas the Trench- 
to-Andes climb is a majestic 42,000 feet! 

These gigantic mountains are scarcely the still, quiet cradle of the 
deep that sailors sing of. 

Avalanches and landslides are fearsome enough on dry-land peaks, but 
they are miniature imitations of the violent, high-speed, almost cos- 
mically enormous slides that crash down the sides of the submerged 
mountains. 

These are mudslides, half unstable to begin with because of wetness, 
triggered into planet-shaking slips by earthquake, current, or plain 
accumulation of unthinkable weight to which all of Mount Everest is 
as but a boulder. 

“Oh, come, now!" a mountain-climber who has scaled Everest and 
knows its size might be justified in exclaiming. “Isn’t that stretching it a 
bit? Exactly how big is one of your blooming mudslides?” 

Well, the one in the Grand Banks in 1929 slid three hundred and fifty 
miles. 

Not thousand or tens of thousands of tons slipped but whole cubic 
miles of mud that changed the entire contour of the ocean bottom in that 
area — peaks sheared off, cables covered or snapped, valleys as big as 
those on land filled in by the hugest Earthmover of them all ! 

The greatest mountains haven’t been conquered yet. Those who must 
climb them “because they’re there” will find plenty “there” in the sea.

Ask a sensible question and you’re sure to 
get a sensible answer — remembering that 
one man’s sense may be a machine’s poison! 




By CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



J ASSO laid the bulky report “That’s encouraging,” Tern 
on his superior’s desk. said with a wry smile. “The 

“No one living can solve the second generation?” 
problem,” he said. “The probabilities are high. 

Tern stared at him quizzi- The most likely father is a 
cally and leaned back in the man named Lao Protik, a 
cushioned chair behind his psycho-artist living in Nu- 
desk. york.” 



107 





“The mother?” 

Jasso grinned, a flashing 
grin in a dark face. He sank 
into a chair, pulled out a ciga- 
rette pack and offered one to 
Tern. The older man shook his 
head, fishing in his pocket for 
an old-fashioned pipe. Jasso 
clicked out a cigarette and 
drew deeply on it. 

“That’s one of the fascinat- 
ing angles about dealing with 
the Calculator,” he said. “We 
combined the fifty most prob- 
able fathers, including Lao, 
with the fifty most probable 
mothers. Believe it or not, we 
drew an absolute blank. They 
just don’t jibe at all.” 

“Not too surprising,” said 
Tern. “It’s happened before. 
But I gather you’ve already 
decided to work with this 
psycho-artist. Why?” 

“Lao’s so far ahead of the 
rest, both men and women, it’s 
the only thing to do. And, 
since life is full of little sur- 
prises, we found the probabil- 
ity highest if Lao marries a 
woman whose own separate 
probability rating is close to 
zero.” Jasso consulted his 
notes and added : “She’s a lan- 
guage teacher named Grida 
Mattin, living in Southgate, 
Tennessee.” 

“You’re pretty sure these 
results are right?” asked Tern. 

“I’ve checked every angle I 
could think of,” replied Jasso 
carefully. “Of course, there’s 
always the possibility that two 
near-zero probabilities would 
add up better, when combined. 

103 



But the probability rating for 
marriage between these two is 
very high — you can see for 
yourself when you check the 
figures. I think it’s the best 
we’ll find.” 

“It would be so much sim- 
pler if we had a high probabil- 
ity among people in this gener- 
ation,” said Tern thoughtfully. 
“Arranging a marriage be- 
tween two strangers is a tick- 
lish business.” 

“It’s been done before,” said 
Jasso. “I’ll put a team of 
agents to work on it right 
away.” 

T HERE were millions of 
cards — if you could call 
things the size of a bedsheet 
“cards.” Each punched with 
holes like a swiss cheese, they 
filled one of the Calculator’s 
most strategic banks. They 
represented every man, wom- 
an and child in the civilized 
world. 

Through them, the course of 
history could be guided, the 
advancement of civilization ac- 
celerated. By racing through 
the backgrounds and capabili- 
ties of every person in the 
United Nations, the Calcula- 
tor could find the best one to do 
any job, to solve any problem. 

Lao Protik, as he strolled 
into his swank Nuyork apart- 
ment building that July eve- 
ning, was completely unaware 
that the Calculator had point- 
ed a finger at him. Life flowed 
smoothly for him. Not a worry 
darkened the horizon. His an- 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




nual salary from Consolidated 
Ads was five hundred thou- 
sand dols — a comfortable 
thirty thousand after taxes — 
and he maintained three mis- 
tresses in separate apart- 
ments. 

In the lobby, he paused to 
open his mailbox. Two letters 
fell out into his hands ; he tore 
the envelopes neatly across 
the end. 

The first was an advertise- 
ment for the 2125 model of the 
Sky Swallow convertible heli- 
cal*. He crumpled it and tossed 
it into a potted palm. 

He grunted in surprise as he 
read the second one. 

“Vr. Lao Protik,” he read. 
“Our firm has been impressed 
with your accomplishments 
and growing reputation as a 
psycho-artist. We are in a po- 
sition to offer you employment 
at a salary of one hundred 
thousand dols annually. Our 
representative, Vr. Casto 
Roche, will call on you in a few 
days to discuss this offer with 
you.” 

The letter bore the illegible 
scrawl of someone who signed 
himself as president of Color- 
vue Publicity, Inc. Lao had 
never heard of the firm. 

Lao’s lips curled and this 
missive followed the first one 
into the potted palm. He felt a 
momentary irritation at the 
audacity of anyone offering 
him a mere hundred thousand 
dols, then let the entire matter 
slip from his mind. 

Softly whistling the refrain 



of the latest hit tune, “The 
Clouds of Venus Can’t Come 
Between Us,” he caught the el- 
evator and ascended to his last 
untroubled night for a long 
time to come. 

A TERSE memorandum was 
waiting for Lao at his 
office the next morning. It was 
not the sort of thing any 
employe of Consolidated Ads 
could ignore — not even a Class 
A psycho-artist who was an 
officer in his union. A worried 
frown creasing his normally 
smooth forehead, Lao hurried 
down the corridor to the plush 
office of Mavo Caprin, presi- 
dent of the firm. 

Caprin was in no amiable 
mood. He grunted at Lao’s 
somewhat querulous greeting. 
He kept his nose buried in 
papers, puffing ominously on a 
fat cigar for several minutes 
before looking up and waving 
Lao to a seat. 

“Perhaps you can explain 
these, Protik,” said Caprin 
sharply, waving a thick fistful 
of letters. Lao leaned over to 
take them, and glanced through 
several of them. 

The phrases that met his 
eyes astounded and outraged 
him. 

They were such words as 
“this insolent effrontery,” “the 
unwarranted audacity of the 
man,” “a deliberate scheme to 
further rip away the fabric of 
our tottering moral code” — 
all applied to his own work ! 

“I can’t explain them be- 



MATCHMAKER

cause I don’t know what they 
are talking about, Voter Cap- 
rin,” said Lao. 

" They’re talking about 
these,” replied Caprin. With 
the flourish of a magician tak- 
ing a rabbit out of a hat, he 
produced a sheaf of Lao’s 
original paintings from his 
desk drawer. 

Lao riffled through them. 
At first glance, he saw nothing 
wrong. Then he looked more 
closely, and began to compare 
them with specific complaints 
in the letters. 

His face flushed bright red 
with anger. 

Only one in a hundred read- 
ers of the advertisements that 
carried Lao Protik’s artwork 
would have noticed, but the 
complaints were justified ! The 
melange which was a compe- 
tent psycho-artist’s painting 
was carefully confused to 
achieve a specific psycholog- 
ical objective — in Lao Protik’s 
work, to make people want to 
buy the products sponsored by 
Consolidated Ads. But in these 
paintings the psychological 
impact had been distorted 
cleverly. The psycho-art had 
been turned into effective 
propaganda for polygamy ! 

“Somebody has altered my 
work,” said Lao firmly. “I de- 
mand a thorough check of 
every artist on the staff.” 

Caprin shook his head. “That 
won’t be necessary. I’ve had 
these paintings checked by ex- 
perts, and they all agree this 
is your original work.” 



“rpHAT’S outrageous!” ex- 
A claimed Lao. “What ‘ex- 
perts’ told you such lies?” 

“It doesn’t matter,” said 
Caprin, a bit wearily now. “I 
don’t like to do it after such a 
long association, Lao, but Con- 
solidated Ads has a reputation 
to maintain. We can’t take 
sides in politics. We have to 
let you go.” 

Lao stared at him. Then he 
hurled paintings and letters in 
Caprin’s face and stalked to 
the door. Halfway out of the 
office, he turned and shouted 
furiously: 

“The Psycho-Artists Guild 
will have something to say 
about this, Caprin !” 

“I don’t think so,” Caprin 
retorted mildly, rubbing a 
bruised cheek. 

It wasn’t long before Lao 
realized the significance of 
that parting remark. His few 
personal belongings jammed 
into his briefcase, he emerged 
on the roof of the huge Con- 
solidated Ads building and 
looked around for a helicab. 
The cabstands were empty at 
the moment. Waiting under an 
awning, he dropped a dime in- 
to a newspaper vending ma- 
chine. It clucked and ejected 
the noon edition of the Star 
into his hands. 

A good-sized headline on 
Page One proclaimed: “Art 
Union Ejects Protik.” His eyes 
bulging slightly, Lao read 
swiftly: 

In a specially called meet- 
ing of its executive com-

mittee, the Psycho-Artists 
Guild this morning revoked 
the membership of its sec- 
ond vice-president, Lao Pro- 
tik, chief psycho-artist for 
Consolidated Ads. 

Officers of the union re- 
fused to make public the 
reason for Protik's ejec- 
tion, but there were reports 
that some connection with 
the notorious Polygamy 
League was involved. Pro- 
tik could not be reached for 
comment immediately, and 
the switchboard operator at 
Consolidated Ads said she 
had instructions not to ring 
his office. 

T TNSHAVEN and bleary- 
eyed, Lao argued plain- 
tively over the telephone with 
his old friend, Majo Hobel, 
personnel chief at Autovance 
Advertising. Hobel had tried 
several times in the past to 
woo Lao from Consolidated 
Ads. 

“It's no good, Lao,” said 
Hobel. “You’ve been black- 
balled.” 

“But it’s all a pack of lies, 
Majo!” cried Lao. “You know 
the inside of the field. How 
about the foreign firms?” Any- 
thing outside of Nuyork was 
“foreign.” 

“It’s the same in Kahgo and 
all over. Sorry, Lao.” 

Cursing, Lao slammed down 
the receiver and dialed the 
number of Tinna, his favorite 
mistress. A voice he recognized 
as Tinna's answered. 



“Tinna,” he began, “this is 
Lao . .” 

“She isn't here,” said Tinna 
frigidly. The telephone clicked 
in his ear. 

Lao's shoulders drooped. He 
put the phone in its cradle and, 
without much hope, prepared 
to dial Phreda, another mis- 
tress. It buzzed at him before 
he could begin. 

He answered it. 

“Voter Protik, there's a 
gentleman in the lobby to see 
you, "said the apartment house 
operator. 

“I don't want to see any 
more reporters!” shouted Lao 
angrily. 

“This isn't a reporter, sir. 
He says he's a representative 
of Colorvue Publicity.” 

“Never heard of it,” growl- 
ed Lao. “But send him up.” 

He had no time to shave, but 
he washed his face and tried 
to make himself a little more 
presentable before the apart- 
ment buzzer sounded. He ad- 
mitted an elderly man with a 
gray mustache, who had the 
well-fed air of a corporation 
executive. 

“Voter Protik, I am Roche 
of Colorvue Publicity,” his vis- 
itor introduced himself. “You 
recieved our letter several 
days ago?” 

Lao searched his memory. 
Vaguely he recalled such a let- 
ter and his hopes began to rise. 
Wasn’t it something about of- 
fering him a job? 

He asked Roche. 

“That's correct, sir,” replied 

111 



MATCHMAKER 




Roche. “A hundred thousand 
dols a year, one-quarter pay- 
able in advance.” 

“You may not want me 
now,” said Lao gloomily. He 
had no scruples about putting 
over a sharp business deal, but 
any contract he might draw 
would be invalid if he withheld 
information. 

“We are aware of your re- 
cent difficulties,” said Roche 
sympathetically. “I wish to as- 
sure you we do not believe the 
charges that you are associated 
with the Polygamy League. 
Also you may wish to know 
that my firm, while a small 
one, is a reputable one. A 
check of the Business Practices 
Agency will prove that to you.” 
“I’m not a member of 
the Psycho-Artists Guild any 
more,” Lao reminded him bit- 
terly, “to say nothing of hav- 
ing been blackballed by all 
major firms and abandoned by 
my three mistresses.” 

“We have no union contract, 
and your personal life is your 
own,” answered Roche with a 
slight smile. “Your known 
ability is sufficient for us. 
There is one thing, however. 
Yaur work will not be in Nu- 
york, but in Southgate, a small 
town in Tennessee. If you see 
fit to accept our offer, we will 
arrange in advance for your 
quarters there. There will be 
no cost to you.” 

“I hate to leave Nuyork,” 
said Lao slowly. “And Pm 
frank to say that I hate to 
come down from half a million 



dols to a hundred thousand. 
But your offer comes as a life- 
saver to me, Voter Roche. Pm 
inclined to accept it.” 

“Good,” said Roche. “Think 
on it, if you like. Pll put a 
signed contract in the next 
mail for you. When you return 
it with your signature, your 
ticket and instructions will be 
waiting for you at Lagwad 
Airport.” 

They shook hands on it, and 
Roche walked out of Lao’s life 
— for a while. 

H IS hands in his pockets, 
Lao strolled into the kitch- 
en, where his landlady, Grida 
Mattin, was melodiously pre- 
paring lunch. Grida wore an 
apron over her old-fashioned 
opaque clothing and her head, 
beginning to show a few gray 
streaks, was bent over the 
gleaming stove. 

“Grida, do you mind if I use 
the telephone for a long-dis- 
tance call to Nuyork?” he 
asked. 

“Certainly not, Lao,” she 
answered, turning to smile at 
him. Her face was not excep- 
tionally attractive, but she 
had beautiful teeth. “Nothing 
wrong, I hope.” 

“I don’t know,” he said. 
“My salary check is three 
weeks overdue.” 

He placed the call to Color- 
vue Publicity on the kitchen 
extension, and stood by the 
stove, watching Grida stir and 
season. 

“Cooking is almost a lost 
CHARLES L. FONTENAY

art, Grida, and you're a good 
cook," he said. “I'm surprised 
you've never married." 

Grida flushed at the compli- 
ment. 

“It may sound boastful, but 
I've never courted a man, 
Lao," she said. “As you may 
have noticed, I have conserv- 
ative habits. I'm afraid I'm a 
little out of place in the mod- 
ern world. I don't approve of 
the frivolous attitude people 
have toward marriage now." 

Lao looked at her, not with- 
out some affection. Of course 
he had made advances, as most 
men did to all unmarried wo- 
men with whom they associ- 
ated. 

But Grida was a history 
teacher, and she lived by the 
outmoded morals of the distant 
past. She had made it known 
at once that marriage was her 
price for intimacy, and she 
gave no hint she was inter- 
ested in marriage. 

“There's nothing frivolous 
about it from the man's view- 
point, when only a woman can 
apply for a divorce," replied 
Lao. “That's why it's hard for 
women to catch husbands. 
With ten women to every man, 
most men have no trouble find- 
ing mistresses." 

“I don't approve of that, ei- 
ther," said Grida, compressing 
her lips firmly. 

The telephone interrupted, 
and Lao went into the library 
to talk. 

“On your call, sir," came the 
thin voice of the Nuyork oper- 



ator, “there is no Colorvue 
Publicity listed." 

“What!" he exclaimed. 
“There must be ! Check again." 

He waited a long, anxious 
moment. 

“I'm sorry, sir," came the 
operator's voice again. “I have 
checked our directory, and 
there is no Colorvue Publicity 
listed." 

Lao swore fervently. 

“Wait a minute," he cried. 
“Nuyork? Hold it just a min- 
ute, will you?" 

He raced up the ramp to his 
second floor bedroom, fumbled 
through his dresser drawer 
until he found his contract and 
ran back downstairs with it. 
He had the operator check the 
name of every Colorvue Pub- 
licity official who had signed 
the contract. None was listed. 

“I know there's a Colorvue 
Publicity!" he shouted desper- 
ately. “Get me the Business 
Practices Agency." 

“Just a moment, sir." 

A man's voice answered at 
the Business Practices Agen- 
cy. It took him several min- 
utes to check the files in 
compliance with Lao's request 
for information. 

“We have no such firm listed 
in our records," he said at 
last. 

“rkAMMIT, I know you do!" 

mJ exclaimed Lao. “You told 
me Colorvue Publicity had a 
Double-A2 rating when I 
checked with you, not four 
months ago."

“Was the request for a rat- 
ing by letter or by telephone, 
sir?” 

“By telephone. It didn’t take 
the girl three minutes to find 
it.” 

“There’d be no record of 
your request if it was made 
by telephone. There must have 
been some mistake, sir. If 
there were a firm named Col- 
orvue Publicity in any city in 
the world having a population 
of more than 100,000, it would 
be in our records.” 

Lao cursed him and hung 
up. Grida came out of the 
kitchen, wiping her hands on 
her apron. 

“I couldn’t help overhear- 
ing, Lao,” she said. “There 
must be something wrong. 
That company sent me a check 
for your first three months’ 
room and board. It cleared the 
bank all right.” 

“So did my salary check for 
the first quarter,” he said. 
“But the Business Practices 
Agency is supposed to keep 
records of a firm for a year 
after its dissolution. I can’t 
understand anybody paying 
out twenty-five thousand dols 
and then just disappearing !” 

“If you need any help to tide 
you over, Lao . .” she said 
hesitantly. “My salary isn’t 
much — fifteen thousand dols a 
year. But I have something 
saved.” 

“Thanks, Grida, but I’ll be 
all right,” he said, turning 
away. 

Lao left the house and strode 



down the quiet streets of 
Southgate, fuming. This had 
all the earmarks of a conspir- 
acy. First the sabotage at Con- 
solidated Ads, now the utter 
disappearance of Colorvue 
Publicity. But he could think 
of no enemies who would have 
reason to conspire against 
him. The field of psycho-art 
was a highly specialized one, 
without bitter competition. 

Back in his room at Grida 
Mattin’s house were half a 
dozen canvases that reflected 
all his co-ordinated skill. Done 
on the instructions he found 
at Lagwad Airport the night 
he left Nuyork, they depicted 
all the advantages of marriage 
in a small Southern town. His 
now-vanished employers had 
never sent him instructions 
for their disposal. Now the 
work was wasted, unless he 
could sell them free-lance. 

The brown autumn leaves 
were drifting dow 7 n on the 
crumbling sidewalks of South- 
gate, stripping the trees that 
lined the streets. Blue smoke 
drifted from chimneys of a 
few of the old houses, dissi- 
pating into the gray sky. It 
w r as an atmosphere that fitted 
his mood of despair. 

The most pressing problem 
that faced him w r as financial. 
Lao was a lavish man with his 
money. His balance at the 
bank now wouldn’t cover his 
income tax for the year. It was 
something he’d never had to 
worry about before, because 
good psycho-artists were well- 



114 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




paid and aways in demand. 
Now, marooned in the Tennes- 
see hills, blackballed by every 
big firm in the nation, his 
prospects looked bleak. 

Something Grida had said 
stuck in his mind. Fifteen 
thousand a year — plus sav- 
ings. It wasn’t a great deal, 
after taxes, but it was a living. 
And he could pay his own 
taxes next March. 

He shook his head and 
turned his steps back toward 
the house. Marriage was the 
very last resort for Lao. He’d 
try free-lancing the Colorvue 
paintings first. 

OCHE looked unhappy. 
“While he was working 
on the paintings he didn’t have 
time to get around town, such 
as it is,” he said. “He and 
Grida were together a lot. 
They seemed to get along. Now 
he’s sold the paintings and he’s 
spending the money on a mis- 
tress.” 

“Well, Jasso, this is your 
baby,” said Tern. “What 
now?” 

“A mistress can be scared 
off pretty easily,” said Jasso. 
“We’ve got agents pulling 
strings all over the place right 
now to stave off a worse prob- 
lem than that. Grida’s sister, 
Alina, visits her every year 
and our secondary checks with 
the Calculator show such a 
visit would be fatal to any 
chances of a Lao-Grida mar- 
riage. Alina’s a doctor in Fris- 
co. We’ve managed to get the 

MATCHMAKER 



hospital authorities to post- 
pone her vacation, but we've 
got to get Lao and Grida mar- 
ried pretty quick. They can’t 
stall Alina off forever.” 

“It strikes me that you’re 
just as far away from the 
marriage as you were at the 
beginning,” commented Tern. 

“How do you make two peo- 
ple want to marry each other ?” 
countered Jasso. “It’s not 
enough the Calculator has to 
pick out a woman 20 years 
older than he is. Checking 
them against each other, they 
are basically incompatible.” 

“Can you tell them? Maybe 
if they knew how important 
their marriage is to the 
world . .” 

“I’ve checked that,” said 
Jasso. “We can’t. The proba- 
bility would drop to almost 
nothing.” 

“Excuse me, sir,” inter- 
posed Roche. “All the perti- 
nent information on the basic 
personalities of Lao and Grida 
is filed in their Calculator 
cards. It seems to me that all 
you’d have to do would be to 
ask the Calculator how to 
make them want to marry 
each other.” 

“Dealing with the Calcula- 
tor isn’t quite that simple, 
Roche,” replied Jasso with a 
smile. “It’s a machine. It has 
no language that would permit 
it to tell us how things are 
done, even though we might 
say it knows, because it has all 
the necessary information. 

“If we ask for information 

115 





recorded in the Calculator, it 
can refer us to the place in the 
file to find it — if we phrase the 
question properly. If we ask a 
true-or-false question, it will 
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no/ if it has 
the answer. If we ask for cor- 
relation of information, the 
Calculator can give us the 
probability of attaining an ob- 
jective. 

“That's why it takes such 
long training to become a Cal- 
culator operator. The Calcula- 
tor can correlate the emotional 
factors of Lao and Grida for 
us, but we have to draw our 
own conclusions for action 
from them — and then ask the 
Calculator for probabilities. 
That's all." 

Tern had listened gravely, 
without interrupting, his 
hands folded across the bulge 
of his stomach. 

“You evidently haven't been 
asking the right questions, 
Jasso," he remarked sardon- 
ically. “It's hard for me to 
realize that this is the Jasso 
who stopped the Brazilo-Pana- 
manian War and solved the 
economic crisis that threat- 
ened Pakistan." 

“I've still got a few tricks up 
my sleeve, Chief," retorted 
Jasso. “The only way to make 
a pair want to marry is to 
throw them together and then 
exploit their psychological 
weakness. Make them need 
each other. I've got a psychol- 
ogy team checking Lao and 
Grida with a fine-tooth comb, 
and we'll check their recom- 



mendations with the Calcula- 
tor." 

“From what you've told me, 
I'd say Lao's biggest weakness 
is a love of luxurious living," 
suggested Tern. “That takes 
money, you know." 

“Economic pressure alone 
doesn't go deep enough to 
drive him to marriage. Not 
with so many available women 
around. Don't worry; we're 
using economic pressure to 
keep him off balance. But the 
psychologists tell us the final 
motivation must be an emo- 
tional frustration. It doesn't 
have to be a big one, but it 
must be basic." 

L AO had had the letter for 
two days, and still didn't 
know what to do about it. It 
had cost him two sleepless 
nights. 

In the old days in Nuyork he 
would have aired his troubles 
to friends at the Psycho-Ar- 
tists Club and probably acted 
on a dozen varying bits of ad- 
vice at the same time. Here 
there was no one to whom he 
could turn. 

He glared morosely at the 
unfinished painting. The can- 
vas gleamed with iridescent 
whorls and lines, from which 
the face and form of Grida 
Mattin were beginning to 
emerge. In the maze of waxing 
and waning colors could be dis- 
tinguished, if one looked close- 
ly enough, faint countenances 
of women and babies with ex- 
pressions of anxiety, of fear, 



116 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




of hunger for love . with oc- 
casionally a man. 

It would have sold well, he 
thought. Free-lancing had 
been a promising idea. 

He dragged himself down- 
stairs to breakfast. He usually 
reacted to Grida’s singing. It 
pleased him mildly when he 
was in an expansive mood, ir- 
ritated him when his mind 
was on something else. 

This morning he hardly 
heard it. * 

“Alina will be here in three 
weeks,” Grida imparted over 
the toast and coffee. 

“Alina?” he asked, without 
mucli interest. 

“My sister. Haven’t I men- 
tioned her to you before?” 

“No, I don’t think so. Where 
is she?” 

“She’s a doctor in Frisco. 
She visits me every year, but 
she’s already more than a 
month late this year.” 

A doctor. Jasso raised a 
mental image of Alina as sort 
of a duplicate of Grida, a plain, 
elderly woman with graying 
hair swept back into a bun at 
the nape of her neck. Right 
now, however, he had more 
important matters on his 
mind. 

“Grida, do you know a good 
lawyer?” he blurted. 

“Why, yes. Tello Distane is 
the best in town,” she said. “Is 
there anything the matter, 
Lao?” 

Silently, he pulled the crum- 
pled letter from his pocket and 
handed it to her. It was from a 



prominent Nuyork legal firm. 
It said : 



On behalf of our clients, 
Colorvue Publicity, Inc., we 
are instituting suit against 
you for one million dols in 
damages, for having dis- 
posed of psycho-paintings 
you contracted to accom- 
plish for them. 

“But isn’t that the company 
you couldn’t find any report 
of?” gasped Grida. 

“It disappeared right off the 
map,” said Lao grimly. “Now 
it’s appeared again. I can’t 
understand this at all!” 

“I’d take it to Tello,” said 
Grida firmly. “He can tell you 
what you should do.” 

H E took his letter to Dis- 
tane that afternoon. Small 
towns change little, and the 
attorney’s office was upstairs 
over a department store, as 
his great-grandfather’s prob- 
ably had been. 

Distane, a white-haired man 
with a leonine cast to his jaw, 
listened with fingertips to- 
gether for a few moments, un- 
til the details of Lao’s troubles 
began to unfold. 

“Just a moment, Voter,” he 
said. “What did you say your 
name is?” 

“Lao Protik,” answered 
Lao, somewhat nettled. 

Moistening his index finger, 
Distane shuffled through some 
papers on his desk, peering at 

117 



MATCHMAKER 




them with intense concentra- 
tion. At last his face lit. 

“Ah, Voter Protik,” he said, 
settling back in his chair. “We 
have a new partner in our 
firm ... an experienced attor- 
ney, you understand, but new 
to our firm. I think Voter At- 
tok is the man who should han- 
dle your case.” 

Getting to his feet with a 
grunt, Distane led Lao into an 
adjoining room which gave 
evidence of having been newly 
furnished not long before. An 
urbane-looking man of middle 
age sat behind the desk, twid- 
dling a letter opener idly. 

“This,” said Distane heav- 
ily, “is Lao Protik, Voter At- 
tok.” 

Distane left, shutting the 
door behind him. Lao stared at 
Attok. Attok raised his eye- 
brows quizzically. 

. “Excuse me,” apologized 
Lao hurriedly. “I was just try- 
ing to remember if we had met 
before, Voter Attok. Your face 
seems very familiar to me.” 

“I don’t believe so,” said At- 
tok in a well-modulated voice. 
“I gather from Voter Distane 
that you have a legal problem 
on your mind, Voter Protik. 
Won’t you sit down?” 

Settling himself in a chair, 
Lao handed the letter to Attok. 
Prompted occasionally by 
questions from the attorney, 
he outlined the events leading 
to its receipt. 

“Well, I don’t think you 
have anything to worry about, 
Voter Protik,” said Attok 



when he had finished. “If they 
were delinquent in payment of 
your salaiy before you sold 
the psycho-paintings and you 
tried unsuccessfully to contact 
them through the Business 
Practices Agency, they have 
no lawsuit. Just leave this let- 
ter with me for a few days 
and I’ll get in touch with you 
when I’ve completed the in- 
vestigation necessary to docu- 
ment our case.” 

Lao left, feeling better but 
racking his brain for an elu- 
sive memory. He was sure he 
had seen Attok before. 

T HREE days later, Attok 
called Lao back to his 
office. The atmosphere was not 
nearly as hospitable. 

“I thought you understood, 
Voter Protik, that a man must 
be absolutely honest with his 
attorney,” said Attok severely. 
“I can’t handle your case prop- 
erly when you withhold facts 
from me.” 

“I haven’t withheld any 
facts,” said Lao, surprised. 

“You did tell me that the 
Business Practices Agency 
had told you there was no such 
firm as Colorvue Publicity, 
didn’t you? The BPA tells me 
they have no record of your 
getting in touch with them 
about the matter. They say 
Colorvue Publicity has been 
recorded in their files for sev- 
eral years. It is a small but 
reputable firm.” 

“It was a telephone check,” 
said Lao desperately. “I don’t 



118 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




know who the man was I talk- 
ed to, but I'll swear he said 
there was no Colorvue Public- 
ity!” 

“Mmm.” Attok stared keen- 
ly at him. “As I recall, you told 
me also that you had not re- 
ceived your salary from Color- 
vue ?" 

“That's right, and how they 
expect me to hold onto the 
paintings when they don't pay 
me . 

“How about these?'' 

Attok laid the photostats of 
three checks on the desk. Each 
was for twenty-five thousand 
dols, and made out to Lao 
Protik from Colorvue Public- 
ity, Inc. 

Lao recognized one of them 
as the check he had received as 
his first quarter salary ad- 
vance. The other two were ex- 
act duplicates, but dated at 
three-month intervals. The 
photostats of the backs of 
the checks — all of them — bore 
what appeared to be his en- 
dorsement. 

“It's forgery!” howled Lao. 
“I only signed one of those 
checks! It's a conspiracy to 
ruin me!" 

“Conspiracy or not, Voter 
Protik, we can't win your case 
if experts say that's your 
handwriting. The expert I took 
it to says it is.” 

Lao collapsed. 

“Who’s doing this to me, 
Voter Attok?” he whimpered. 
“Why are they doing it?” 

“On the face of it, I'd say to 
get your money,” replied 

MATCHMAKER 



Attok sympathetically. “You 
were a very successful psycho- 
artist before your . ah . 
misfortune." 

“I don't have any money. I 
have saved nothing.” 

“You are familiar with the 
law, aren't you? If they win 
the suit, they're entitled to 
half of everything you make 
above a minimum five thou- 
sand dols annually, until the 
judgment is paid.” 

“I don't make five thousand 
dols a year. I don't have a job. 
What can I do, Voter Attok?” 
“Why, as long as you make 
less than five thousand dols a 
year, they can't touch you,” 
replied Attok. “But to safe- 
guard your finances in the 
event you do regain your for- 
mer financial status, I'd sug- 
gest you incorporate yourself, 
with your wife as the control- 
ling stockholder. Then you can 
limit your personal salary to 
five thousand dols a year, and 
the remainder of the income 
will be under her control. The 
law can't touch it.” 

“But . but I'm not mar- 
ried,” said Lao. 

Attok raised his eyebrows 
slightly. 

“Oh, well, it doesn't mat- 
ter," he said at last. “As long 
as you make less than five 
thousand.” 

The wheels in Lao’s brain 
were clicking as he left Attok's 
office. He thought he saw 
through the whole scheme 
against him. Whoever was be- 
hind Colorvue Publicity had 

119 




engineered the frauds that got 
him blackballed and discharg- 
ed from Consolidated. They 
had maneuvered him into a po- 
sition where he would be vul- 
nerable to a million-dol legal 
judgment. Now, undoubtedly, 
the next move was to clear 
him and restore his reputa- 
tion, so he’d be financially 
able to pay off. 

It was devilish — and he saw 
no way out. 

T AO moped around the 
-Li house, his nerves near the 
breaking point. Daily he 
dreaded notification that the 
damage suit had been formally 
instituted, a move which 
would cut off his only chance 
to see his income and his posi- 
tion in the psycho-art field re- 
stored. 

Marriage? It was on his 
mind constantly. The idea dis- 
turbed him almost as much as 
the thought of Colorvue taking 
a big slice of his income for 
the next decade or so. He 
might have been inclined to 
marry one of his three mis- 
tresses in Nuyork — before 
they showed themselves for 
what they were — but he knew 
better than to trust his former 
Southgate mistress with con- 
trol of his finances. She had 
abandoned him as soon as the 
money from the sale of his 
paintings had run out. 

A mailman’s visit was an 
unusual enough phenomenon 
to create interest, for it meant 
the delivery of a package. Let- 



ter mail was delivered from 
the post office to each home 
through a vacuum tube sys- 
tem. Since it was a letter Lao 
feared, he watched with con- 
siderable interest when the 
mailman approached the front 
door, and curiosity was upper- 
most in his mind when Grida 
called from downstairs to say 
the package was for him. 

He knew no one who would 
be sending him a package. 

Grida, her own curiosity ap- 
parent, made no move to leave 
the room when he took the 
large, oblong package from 
her and prepared to open it. A 
premonition smote him as he 
noted the return address : 
“The Nuyork Gallery of Tra- 
ditional Art.” 

With trembling fingers he 
tore away the wrappings. His 
paintings — all three of them — 
tumbled to the floor. 

He dropped into a chair, 
limp. The most important 
thing in his life was lying, 
broken, before him. 

“What is this?” exclaimed 
Grida. She picked up one of 
the paintings and examined it. 
“This isn’t psycho-art,” she 
said. “This is real ! I like this, 
Lao.” 

“It’s what I’ve always want- 
ed to do,” he said in a tired 
voice. “Those three paintings 
have hung in the Gallery of 
Traditional Art for nearly ten 
years.” 

“There’s a letter attached,” 
she said, holding it out to him. 

“Go ahead — open it, Gri-

da,” he said- “I think I know 
what it says.” 

G RIDA tore open the en- 
velope and unfolded the 
letter. 

In accordance with in- 
structions from our board 
of directors, in special 
meeting, all the paintings 
hanging in our gallery have 
been re-evaluated. We re- 
gret to inform you that 
your paintings were judged 
to be no longer representa- 
tive of traditional art. They 
are being returned to you 
herewith. We wish to ex- 
press our appreciation . 

She stopped reading. 

“That’s right,” said Lao mo- 
rosely. “They threw my paint- 
ings out.” 

“But, Lao, I didn’t know you 
did this sort of thing,” she 
said, bewildered. 

“It’s what I’ve always want- 
ed to do,” he repeated. “I 
never really liked psycho-art. I 
never believed it’s real art. It 
isn’t something the artist feels 
and thinks, it’s something he 
tries to make other people feel 
and think. 

“But psycho-art is the only 
kind of art I could make 
money at. I didn’t have the 
courage to starve in an attic 
or make a living in some pro- 
saic way and paint as a hobby. 

I turned my talent into cash 
and I always spent the cash as 
fast as I made it — maybe be- 



cause I was ashamed that I 
was a coward.” 

“But these three?” asked 
Grida. 

“Sometimes,” said Lao 
dreamily, “I’ve had time to do 
what I wanted to do. These 
are the best I’ve ever done. 
When I gave them to the gal- 
lery, they told me these were 
among the highest examples of 
traditional art they had ever 
seen. I thought they meant it, 
but I know now it was just 
because I was a famous, 
wealthy psycho-artist.” 

Grida studied the paintings. 
One was a seascape, the other 
two mountain scenes. The 
titles gave some key to Lao’s 
inner feelings : “Peace in the 
Valley,” “The Moving Wa- 
ters,” “The Lonely Peak.” 

“Your trouble is that you 
grew up a little boy in a big 
city,” said Grida quietly. “You 
ought to try to forget the sort 
of things you knew in Nuyork 
and settle down to a life among 
simple folk, like the people 
around here. I think you could 
find work here, Lao, that 
would be a living for you. And 
you’d have plenty of time to 
relax and paint the way you 
want to.” 

Lao looked at her and saw 
that her eyes were full of sym- 
pathy for him. It was the last 
little push his overwrought 
emotions needed. 

He did not do it at once ; but 
that night, after supper, he 
proposed marriage to Grida 
Mattin and she accepted. 



122 CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




T ERN was furious. He did 
not raise his voice, but Jas- 
so could detect his anger in his 
eyes and the tone of his voice. 

“I put this matter entirely 
in your hands, Jasso, and I 
expected you to do a thorough 
job on it,” Tern said coldly. 
“It’s inconceivable to me that 
you should be so negligent in 
your investigation.” 

“It was my fault, I’ll admit,” 
said the crestfallen Jasso. 
“But you can’t blame the 
clerk. He was told to check the 
personal files on the question 
‘marriage,’ not ‘ability to re- 
produce.’ You'll have to agree 
there’s a difference.” 

“I would think the lowest 
clerk involved in this opera- 
tion would be instructed that 
progeny from the marriage is 
the key factor!” said Tern. 
“The whole purpose of this 
marriage from the first has 
been to produce a child that 
the Calculator said would have 
a high probability rating for 
solving the problem. 

“Can you tell me how the 
devil you bright minds on the 
project expect a marriage to 
produce a child — when the 
wife is sterile?” 

“That’s one thing that 
makes me wonder if there isn’t 
some malad j ustment in the 
Calculator,” said Jasso. “Ster- 
ility has been marked on Gri- 
da Mattin’s card for the last 
eight years. I don’t think you 
can criticize the clerk, or me, 
too harshly for not thinking 
about sterility when the 

MATCHMAKER 



Calculator approved the mar- 
riage. After all, her card was 
in the Calculator and . 

“Don’t repeat yourself,” in- 
terrupted Tern brusquely. “Of 
course, those circuits must be 
checked, but I’ll give 100 to 
one odds right now there’s 
nothing wrong with the Calcu- 
lator. Sterility must have reg- 
istered as a correctible fac- 
tor.” 

“I don’t know why it 
would,” objected Jasso very 
thoughtfully. “The only evi- 
dence the Calculator has is 
that the sterility is a normal 
result of her age, and that 
can’t be reversed as far as I 
know. But the only thing we 
can do is treat it as correcti- 
ble.” 

“Try it,” said Tern. “But, 
Jasso, I want you to realize 
you’re not dealing now with 
the movement of traffic in 
downtown Nuyork or even the 
selection of a president. The 
solution of this problem is 
vital to mankind. I don’t want 
any more slip-ups.” 

A lina mattin'S fresh 

beauty seemed to light the 
interior of the antique Twenty- 
First Century house. She re- 
sembled Grida, but more as 
Grida’s daughter might have 
looked than as her younger sis- 
ter. 

Lao sighed. Had he met 
Alina Mattin first, he did not 
believe any conceivable emer- 
gency could have persuaded 
him to marry her sister. 

123 




“There’s some misunder- 
standing somewhere, but they 
won’t admit it,” said Alina, a 
puzzled frown wrinkling the 
bridge of her nose. She and 
Lao were having supper in the 
breakfast nook ; Lao found her 
quite as competent a cook as 
Grida. 

After more than a year 
at Southgate and many months 
of marriage to Grida, his lean 
features were filling out. 

“I don’t think there’s been a 
mistake,” he said complacent- 
ly. “The board of education or- 
dered Grida to enter the hos- 
pital.” 

“For a routine physical 
check-up, eh?” replied Alina. 
“That isn’t what she’s get- 
ting.” 

“What are they doing, 
then?” asked Lao, startled. 

“They’re examining her to 
see if anything can be done to 
restore her fertility,” answer- 
ed Alina flatly. “Lao, did you 
authorize the hospital to do 
that?” 

“Certainly not! I never 
thought about her fertility, 
one way or another. You’re 
sure you’re not mistaken?” 

“I’m a doctor. I know what 
they’re doing. But the hospital 
administrator won’t tell me a 
thing. He just says that’s on 
the record of her admission to 
the hospital.” 

“They must have gotten her 
records mixed up with some- 
one else,” theorized Lao. 

“Maybe. I don’t know 
whether you knew it or not, 

124 



but Grida is too old to have a 
child.” 

Supper finished, they piled 
the plastic dishes in the dish- 
washer and went into the par- 
lor together. Lao turned the 
lights low. They sat down to- 
gether on the sofa. They sat 
very close together, and after 
a moment Lao put his arm 
around Alina’s shoulders. She 
laid her head contentedly on 
his chest. 

“Why couldn’t you have 
stayed out of my life?” he ask- 
ed, half seriously, half teas- 
ingly. 

“Would you want me to?” 
she asked softly. 

“No,” he admitted, running 
his fingers through her hair. 
“But this isn’t the way I want 
things. I suppose we should be 
thankful for these few days 
while she’s in the hospital, but 
I’m ahamed to be.” 

“So am I,” confessed Alina, 
“but, darling, I’ve been so 
happy here alone with you. 
Tell me, why did you marry 
Grida?” 

“I’m not sure I know,” he 
answered slowly. “I’d hate to 
have to try to analyze my mo- 
tives right now. I like Grida 
and respect her, but I don’t 
love her. I couldn’t. I love you, 
Alina.” 

“Let’s end this sneaking 
about behind Grida’s back, 
Lao,” she urged earnestly, 
looking up into his face. “It 
isn’t fair to her. Get a divorce 
and let’s marry each other.” 

“You know the law doesn’t 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




permit a man to seek a di- 
vorce, Alina. And Grida 
wouldn't release me now. She 
loves me." 

“Grida will divorce you," 
said Alina positively. “It will 
hurt her, but she will. Grida 
is a history teacher, and her 
moral code is strict — and out 
of date. It scarcely gets lip 
service any more from most 
people." 

“You're suggesting I tell 
her about us? I couldn't, 
Alina ! I can’t let her ever find 
out." 

“But she will," said Alina, 
her eyes shining. “Lao, I'm go- 
ing to have a baby." 

T HE man's face looked fa- 
miliar. 

Then he approached Lao 
and Alina, standing in the cor- 
ridor outside the chancery 
courtroom, and Lao recognized 
him with certainty. 

“You're the man from Col- 
orvue!" Lao flashed at him 
angrily. 

“That's right, Voter Protik. 
I'm Casto Roche." The man 
held out his hand. Lao ignored 
it. 

“I ought to beat you all the 
way from here to Nuyork !" he 
growled — with audacity, since 
Roche was a good deal bigger. 
“I trusted you, once." 

“You trusted me twice," re- 
plied Roche amiably. “I think 
you'd recognize me as someone 
else with a little different 
make-up." 

He held his hand to his face 



and puffed out his cheeks 
slightly. 

“Attok ! My lawyer !” yelped 
Lao. People in the corridor 
turned to stare at him. “I won- 
dered why you disappeared 
after I paid you that fee ! I see 
it all now! You were part of 
this whole dirty — " 

“Before you get too excited, 
Voter Protik ..." Roche did 
not complete the sentence, but 
turned under his coat lapel to 
exhibit the badge which iden- 
tified him as a United Nations 
agent. 

Lao gulped and choked off 
his tirade. 

“I'm here to try to stop 
these divorce proceedings be- 
tween you and your wife," said 
Roche. 

“Don't you think you've 
come to the wrong people?" 
suggested Alina, apparently 
not nearly as impressed by 
Roche’s badge as Lao was. 
“My sister is the only one who 
can stop the divorce." 

“Besides, it's too late," said 
Lao, regaining his voice. “The 
hearing is finished. The judge 
will give his decision in a mo- 
ment." 

Roche said, “That can be 
stopped at a word from you. 
As a matter of fact, the judge 
is waiting for me to confer 
with you before calling the 
court back into session. I've 
told your wife why the 
government is interested in 
preserving your marriage. She 
is willing to drop the divorce 
proceedings if you are."

“Perhaps you’d better tell 
us why,” said Alina coolly. 

R OCHE sighed. “All right. 

But it’s rather involved. 
We haven’t let it be publicized 
widely, but the world is faced 
with a very serious sociologi- 
cal problem. I suppose both of 
you are aware that there are a 
great many more women than 
men. 

“Of course,” said Lao, his 
face brightening with reminis- 
cence. 

"Of course,” concurred 
Alina, giving Lao a thoughtful 
glance. 

“If you’ve read the Sunday 
supplements, you know why,” 
said Roche. “Always, more boy 
babies have been born than 
girl babies, but the high mor- 
tality rate among boy babies 
has balanced the discrepancy. 
Now the mortality rate has 
climbed tremendously higher 
for boy babies. We do not 
know why. We do know that 
the ratio of women to men is 
increasing. At the last census 
taken by the Calculator, it was 
9.78 women to each man. 

“Under our present social 
system of monogamous mar- 
riage, this means the actual 
birth rate is decreasing. Even 
the large number of illegiti- 
mate children doesn’t make up 
for the lack of men in the 
world. That, of course, is the 
reason the Polygamy League 
has gained so much strength.” 
“Well, don’t they have a 
point?” asked Lao. He added 



hastily : “I don’t hold with the 
ideas of the Polygamy League, 
you understand, in spite of the 
propaganda that I was con- 
nected with it.” 

Roche smiled. 

“That propaganda was 
manufactured by UN agents,” 
he confessed. “So were all 
your troubles, including the 
dummy corporation. Colox-vue 
Publicity had no other purpose 
but to maneuver you into mar- 
riage wtih Grida Mattin. A 
little unethical, I’ll admit, but 
sometimes we have to work 
that way. You’ll be happy to 
know that the damage suit 
against you has been with- 
drawn. You can get your old 
job back with Consolidated 
Ads and be restored to the 
Psycho- Artists Guild any time 
you wish. And we’ve even ar- 
ranged for the Gallery of Tra- 
ditional Art to re-hang your 
paintings. 

“As a matter of fact,” he 
continued, “the government 
has given serious considera- 
tion to the ideas of the 
Polygamy League, but the Cal- 
culator rejected them; it dis- 
covered that they would have 
an unfortunate impact on our 
social structure. So polygamy 
is not the answer. 

“The Calculator tells us it is 
very improbable that anyone 
now living will find the an- 
swer. 

“But the child of Lao Protik 
and Grida Mattin can — and 
probably will — solve the prob- 
lem.” 



126 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“T'M AFRAID your Calcu- 
-l lator is wrong/' said 
Alina. “Go back and tell your 
government Grida Mattin is 
unable to bear a child." 

“The government has that 
information," replied Roche, 
frowning slightly. “We must 
consider it a soluble problem, 
because the Calculator has the 
information on file and it still 
gave us a high probability on 
the marriage. The Calculator 
is a machine. It doesn't make 
mistakes." 

“It's made a mistake this 
time," said Alina positively. 
“Lao and I are going to be 
married. I don't think he will 
give up our chance for happi- 
ness for any such shaky 
scheme." 

“We have no way of forcing 
him," admitted Roche, “but I 
believe Voter Protik should 
speak for himself, knowing 
how important this is." 

“She’s right!" said Lao, an- 
ger in his tone. “I think the 
government has interfered 
with my life enough as it is! 
I’ve done my part, and the 
government didn't even do me 
the courtesy of letting me 
know I was doing it. 1 love 
Alina. I don't intend to be tied 
to Grida for the rest of my life 
just on the outside chance 
you'll come up with a cure for 
her sterility.” 

He turned his back on 
Roche. 

Roche looked at Alina. She 
looked back, coldly. With a 
shrug, Roche left them and 



went through the door to the 
courtroom. 

A few moments later the 
bailiff threw open the court- 
room doors. 

Lao, Alina and Grida filed 
in with the spectators and at- 
torneys. They stood as the 
judge entered from his cham- 
bers, adjusted his black robes 
and took his seat. The spec- 
tators sat down then, but 
the attorneys and principals 
remained standing at the bar. 

The judge put on his specta- 
cles, looked over some papers, 
and raised his head to survey 
the courtroom. Solemnly he 
announced : 

“It is the decision of this 
court that Grida Mattin Pro- 
tik be granted a divorce, as 
requested, from the defen- 
dant, Lao Protik. 

“It is the further decision 
of this court that the co-re- 
spondent in this suit, Alina 
Mattin, being unmarried and 
having proved herself by her 
admitted actions to be an un- 
fit mother, her unborn child 
by the defendant shall be de- 
livered as soon as feasible aft- 
er birth into the custody of 
the complainant, Grida Mat- 
tin Protik.” 

« W ELL, that blows it up,” 
▼V said Jasso despondent- 
ly, laying the newspaper clip- 
ping on Tern's desk. “Lao and 
Alina didn't even contest 
Grida's custody of their 
child, even though their mar- 
riage before its birth legiti- 

127 



MATCHMAKER 




matized it. Now Grida has the 
baby and Lao and Alina have 
gone off to parts unknown.” 
“I suppose we could find 
them, if we tried,” said Tern. 
“But I don’t see the point in 
following this case any far- 
ther, Jasso. They made it 
pretty plain to your agent 
that the Lao-Grida marriage 
is through.” 

“Shall I write it off as 
closed, then?” 

“I’m afraid you might as 
well,” consented Tern reluc- 
tantly. “How have your alter- 
nate combinations turned 
out?” 

“We’ve succeeded in ar- 
ranging several marriages in 
the highest probability group. 
But frankly, Chief, all the 
probability ratings for their 
offspring are pretty low. We 
had our only real chance in 
the Lao-Grida combination.” 
“I don’t want to go to the 
third generation if I can help 
it,” said Tern. “There’s al- 
ways the chance that combi- 
nations of low probability 
individuals might result in 
high probability offspring. 
Let’s run another test on di- 
rect probability, on just those 
individuals who have been 
filed for the first time since 
we began the Lao-Grida 
case.” 

“I’ll get started on it right 
away,” said Jasso. 

T WO days later, Jasso burst 
into Tern’s office highly 
excited, a section of tape from 

128 



the Calculator trailing from 
his grasp. 

“Chief, this is unbeliev- 
able!” he cried. “We have an 
individual here whose prob- 
ability tests 82.371 per cent 
to solve the problem, project- 
ing a life expectancy of 50 
years !” 

Tern whistled and rolled 
his eyes. 

“Pretty high probability!” 
he said delightedly. “Pretty 
doggoned high ! Baby, I sup- 
pose ?” 

“Yes,” said Jasso. He paus- 
ed, and added slowly and with 
emphasis: “The child’s name 
is Nina Mattin.” 

“Mattin?” 

“The daughter of Lao Pro- 
tik and Alina Mattin! Now 
the adopted daughter of 
Grida Mattin.” 

“What!” 

“The strange thing about 
it, Chief, is that Alina Mat- 
tin was one of the higher 
probability mothers we found 
first. But we checked her 
against Lao, and the prob- 
ability for an offspring of 
their marriage was extremely 
low. Do you suppose the Cal- 
culator has gone completely 
haywire?” 

Tern did not answer at 
once. He sat, lost in deep 
thought, for several minutes. 
Then he began laughing. 

He laughed until tears 
came into his eyes, slapping 
his knee delightedly. Jasso 
stood there, looking blank. 

“No, the Calculator’s not 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




haywire, Jasso,” said Tern, 
when he could get his breath. 
“It just has all the facts, and 
it correlates facts we don’t 
even think about. The reason 
we get funny ideas about it 
sometimes is because the Cal- 
culator can’t talk. As you ex- 
plained, it can just answer 
questions, and sometimes we 
don’t ask the right questions. 

“From what’s happened, 
I’d say the question you asked 
the Calculator when you were 
looking for second-generation 
probabilities was not ‘the off- 
spring of two people.’ It was 
‘offspring resulting from the 
marriage of two people.’ Isn’t 
that right?” 

“It seemed the proper way 
to put the question,” an- 
swered Jasso a little stiffly. 

T ERN began laughing again. 

“It was the right ques- 
tion to put,” he choked, “but 
illegitimacy was the key to 
the whole thing! 

“Look: the Calculator had 
all the facts. It knew all about 
the emotional make-up of Lao, 
Grida and Alina. It knew that 
Alina was Grida’s sister. 

“The probability course is 
obvious ! Given a marriage 
between Lao and Grida, the 
probability was high that he 
would meet her sister, Alina, 
under convenient circum- 
stances. The probability was 
high, too, considering the 



emotional make-up of the 
three, that Lao and Alina 
would fall in love. Under our 
present social scheme, an 
illegitimate child was likely. 
So there you are.” 

“Chief, I know you’ve been 
in this business a lot longer 
"than I have,” said Jasso slow- 
ly. “I’ve got to confess now 
that I can’t see the slightest 
reason why the probability 
for a child of Lao and Alina 
should be so much higher un- 
der these circumstances than 
if the two of them just met 
and got married.” 

“Environment, my boy ! It’s 
just as important as heredity. 
Lao’s marriage to Grida was 
the key to the whole thing. 
Grida is a motherly, fiercely 
conscientious type of woman 
who would insist on rearing 
her husband’s child — no mat- 
ter who the mother was. And 
of course the courts would 
uphold her.” 

Tern was laughing again. 
“Anyway, we’ve got it licked. 
We have our high-probabili- 
ty individual . But I’m glad 
of one thing. Suppose you’d 
asked the Calculator to check 
itself — asked it, for instance, 
if we knew what we were do- 
ing. It would have given us a 
straight answer, and we 
would have abandoned the 
whole project — it would have 
told us we didn’t know at 
all!” —END
