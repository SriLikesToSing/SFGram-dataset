P owers to overcome sickness! Means 
to escape poverty! Knowledge to 
bring happiness and peace of mind! 
Skill and genius to create a civiliza- 
tion which we still copy today! These 
are only some of the accomplishments 
of the ancient Egyptians. 

Above and beyond these physical 
achievements wds the secret wisdom 
possessed by the Egyptian mystery 
schools. In these centers of learning 
men and women were taught the laws 
of life and how to master them. With 
this mastery they were able to shape 
their destinies as they wished them to 
be. It takes no greater mental effort 
to achieve results when you know how. 
Successful living is the oldest art in 
the world. It consists of developing 
initiative, foresight and the ability to 
combine experiences into new and 
workable ideas. 

These laws operate as unfailingly 
as the laws which govern the sun, 
moon and planets. They were dis- 
covered centuries ago by certain wise 
men of Egypt, and preserved down 
through the ages by the Rosicrucians.

Time has since crumbled Egypt’s 
walls, but it couldn’t destroy this for- 
mula for the control of life. In your 
hands, this knowledge could alter the 
entire course of your affairs. 

The Rosicrucians offer to you — if 
you have the courage to break away

NOW lOOKl 



COME months back, I issued an 
^ intelligence report that al- 
lowed only one conclusion: 
There Are Aliens Among Us. 

My intent was to inform with- 
out alarming. Evidently I suc- 
ceeded, for out of the jumble of 
letters received, only one was in- 
telligible and therefore clearly 
from a human reader. 

“This is in reference to your 
article in the March issue of 
Galaxy entitled ‘Look Now!’ It is 
strange how one may brood for 
years over a problem and then 
suddenly have it brought into fo- 
cus by reading another’s views on 
the subject. The similarity be- 
tween your conclusions and mine 
is, if you’ll pardon the expression, 
astounding. 

“The subject is my wife. It 
happens that she has been a very 
good wife and I have no desire to 
alter our relationship, even if she 
is an alien. Good wives are not 
easy to find and represent a sub- 
stantial investment. Therefore, I 
am signing this with a pseudo- 
nym and mailing it from a false 
address — and request that both 
be kept confidential. 

“Many of her statements are 
perfectly ordinary spoonerisms. 
Her reference to a ‘platation from 
Quota’ is an example of this. As 

4 



you suggest, perhaps it is a delib- 
erately cultivated type of protec- 
tive coloration designed to draw 
attention away from those slips 
even the best of agents, human or 
otherwise, inevitably make. 

“Some of these verbal prat-falls 
are quite humorous, which sup- 
ports your theory, for humans are 
notoriously uncritical when laugh- 
ing. For instance, she doesn’t care 
for a neighbor’s home because she 
says she doesn’t like ‘overwrought 
iron.’ 

“Yet a certain chilling alien 
viewpoint occasionally reveals it- 
self. Ever since my wife told me 
that the ‘washee-pot needs cough- 
ing,’ I have become uncomforta- 
ble in the presence of all pots. I 
keep wondering if this or that 
pot is a washee-pot and if it in- 
tends to cough. 

“I will give you three more ex- 
amples and ask you to think 
about them. I have tried to rea- 
son them out, but I always some- 
how get the feeling that my mind 
is going cross-eyed. Here they 
are: 

“‘It’s half of one and six-a- 
dozen of the other.’ Close ques- 
tioning has ascertained that this 
is meant to indicate two equal 
quantities, but I challenge any

Dead 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 
Illustrated by EMSH 




T he critters were unbeliev- 
able. They looked like 
something from the maud- 
lin pen of a well-alcoholed car- 
toonist. 

One herd of them clustered in 



a semicircle in front of the ship, i 
not jittery or belligerent — just 
looking at us. And that was 
strange. Ordinarily, when a space- , 
ship sets down on a virgin planet, 
it takes a week at least for any

Here was the perfect world — accommodating 
and peaceful — but how it got that way was 
less ghastly than how it stayed that way! 




life that might have seen or heard 
it to creep out of hiding and 
sneak a look around. 

The critters were almost cow- 
size, but nohow as graceful as a 
cow. Their bodies were pushed 



together as if ever blessed one 
of them had run full-tilt into a 
wall. And they were just as lumpy 
as you’d expect from a collision 
like that. Their hides were 
splashed with large squares of 



DROP DEAD

pastel color — the kind of color 
one never finds on any self-re- 
specting animal: violet, pink, or- 
ange, chartreuse, to name only a 
few. The overall effect was of a 
checkerboard done by an old lady 
who made crazy quilts. 

And that, by far, was not the 
worst of it. 

From their heads and other 
parts of their anatomy sprouted 
a weird sort of vegetation, so that 
it appeared each animal was hid- 
ing, somewhat ineffectively, be- 
hind a skimpy thicket. To com- 
pound the situation and make it 
completely insane, fruits and 
vegetables — or what appeared 
to be fruits and vegetables — 
grew from the vegetation. 

So we stood there, the critters 
looking at us and us looking back 
at them, and finally one of them 
walked forward until it was no 
more than six feet from us. It 
stood there for a moment, gazing 
at us soulfully, then dropped dead 
at our feet. 

The rest of the herd turned 
around and trotted awkwardly 
away, for all the world as if they 
had done what they had come to 
do and now could go about their 
business. 

J ULIAN OLIVER, our botanist, 
put up a hand and rubbed his 
balding head with an absent- 
minded motion. 

“Another whatisit coming up!” 



he moaned. “Why couldn’t it, for 
once, be something plain and sim- 
ple?” 

“It never is,” I told him. “Re- 
member that bush out on Hamal 
V that spent half its life as a 
kind of glorified tomato and the 
other half as grade A poison 
ivy?” 

“I remember it,” Oliver said 
sadly. 

Max Weber, our biologist, 
walked over to the critter, 
reached' out a cautious foot and 
prodded it. 

“Trouble is,” he said, “that 
Hamal tomato was Julian’s baby 
and this one here is mine.” 

“I wouldn’t say entirely yours,” 
Oliver retorted. “What do you 
call that underbrush growing out 
of it?” 

I came in fast to head off an 
argument. I had listened to those 
two quarreling for the past twelve 
years, across several hundred 
light-years and on a couple dozen 
planets. I couldn’t stop it here, I 
knew, but at least I could post- 
pone it until they had something 
vital to quarrel about. 

“Cut it out,” I said. “It’s only a 
couple of hours till nightfall and 
we have to get the camp set up.” 

“But this critter,” Weber said. 
“We can’t just leave it here.” 

“Why not? There are millions 
more of them. This one will stay 
right here and even if it 
doesn’t — ”

“But it dropped dead!” 

“So it was old and feeble.” 
“It wasn’t. It was right in the 
prime of life.” 

“We can talk about it later,” 
said Alfred Kemper, our bacteri- 
ologist. “I’m as interested as you 
two, but what Bob says is right. 
We have to get the camp set up.” 
“Another thing,” I added, look- 
ing hard at all of them. “No mat- 
ter how innocent this place may 
look, we observe planet rules. No 
eating anything. No drinking any 
water. No wandering off alone. 
No carelessness of any kind.” 
“There’s nothing here,” said 
Weber. “Just the herds of critters. 
Just the endless plains. No trees, 
no hills, no nothing.” 

He really didn’t mean it. He 
knew as well as I did the reason 
for observing planet rules. He 
only wanted to argue. 

“All right,” I said, “which is 
it? Do we set up camp or do we 
spend the night up in the ship?” 
That did it. 

E HAD the camp set up be- 
’ * fore the sun went down and 
by dusk we were all settled in. 
Carl Parsons, our ecologist, had 
the stove together and the supper 
started before the last tent peg 
was driven. 

I dug out my diet kit and 
mixed up my formula and all of 
them kidded me about it, the way 
they always did. 



It didn’t bother me. Their jibes 
were automatic and I had auto- 
matic answers. It was something 
that had been going on for a 
long, long time. Maybe it was 
best that way, better than if 
they’d disregarded my enforced 
eating habits. 

I remember Carl was grilling 
steaks and I had to move away 
so I couldn’t smell them. There’s 
never a time when I wouldn’t 
give my good right arm for a 
steak or, to tell the truth, any 
other kind of normal chow. This 
diet stuff keeps a man alive all 
right, but that’s about the only 
thing that can be said of it. 

I know ulcers must sound silly 
and archaic. Ask any medic and 
he’ll tell you they don’t happen 
any more. But I have a riddled 
stomach and the diet kit to prove 
they sometimes do. I guess it’s 
what you might call an occupa- 
tional ailment. There’s a lot of 
never - ending worry playing 
nursemaid to planet survey gangs. 

After supper, we went out and 
dragged the critter in and had a 
closer look at it. 

It was even worse to look at 
close than from a distance. 

There was no fooling about 
that vegetation. It was the real 
McCoy and it was part and par- 
cel of the critter. But it seemed 
that it only grew out of certain 
of the color blocks, in the critter’s 
body.

We found another thing that 
practically had Weber frothing 
at the mouth. One of the color 
blocks had holes in it — it looked 
almost exactly like one of those 
peg sets that children use as toys. 
When Weber took out his jack- 
knife and poked into one of the 
holes, he pried out an insect that 
looked something like a bee. He 
couldn’t quite believe it, so he did 
some more probing and in another 
one of the holes he found another 
bee. Both of the bees were dead. 

He and Oliver wanted to start 
dissection then and there, but the 
rest of us managed to talk them 
out of it. 

We pulled straws to see who 
would stand first guard and, with 
my usual luck, I pulled the short- 
est straw. Actually there wasn’t 
much real reason for standing 
guard, with the alarm system set 
to protect the camp, but it was 
regulation — there had to be a 
guard. 

I got a gun and the others said 
good night and went to their 
tents, but I could hear them talk- 
ing for a long time afterward. No 
matter how hardened you may 
get to this survey business, no 
matter how blase, you hardly 
ever get much sleep the first night 
on any planet. 

T SAT on a chair at one side of 
the camp table, on which 
burned a lantern in lieu of the 

10 



campfire we would have had on 
any other planet. But here we 
couldn’t have a fire because there 
wasn’t any wood. 

I sat at one side of the table, 
with the dead critter lying on the 
other side of it and I did some 
worrying, although it wasn’t time 
for me to start worrying yet. I’m 
an agricultural economist and I 
don’t begin my worrying until at 
least the first reports are in. 

But sitting just across the ta- 
ble from where it lay, I couldn’t 
help but do some wondering 
about that mixed-up critter. I 
didn’t get anywhere except go 
around in circles and I was sort 
of glad when Talbott Fullerton, 
the Double Eye, came out and 
sat down beside me. 

Sort of, I said. No one cared 
too much for Fullerton. I have 
yet to see the Double Eye I or 
anybody else ever cared much 
about. 

“Too excited to sleep?” I 
asked him. 

He nodded vaguely, staring off 
into the darkness beyond the lan- 
tern’s light. 

“Wondering,” he said. “Won- 
dering if this could be the plan- 
et.” 

“It won’t be,” I told him. 
“You’re chasing an El Dorado, 
hunting down a fable.” 

“They found it once before,” 
Fullerton argued stubbornly. “It’s 
all there in the records.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“So was the Gilded Man. And 
the Empire of Prester John. At- 
lantis and all the rest of it. So 
was the old Northwest Passage 
back on ancient Earth. So were 
the Seven Cities. But nobody 
ever found any of those places 
because they weren’t there.” 

He sat with the lamplight in 
his face and he had that wild look 
in his eyes and his hands were 
knotting into fists, then straight- 
ening out again. 

“Sutter,” he said unhappily, “I 
don’t know why you do this — 
this mocking of yours. Some- 
where in this universe there is 
immortality. Somewhere, some- 
how, it has been accomplished. 
And the human race must find it. 
We have the space for it now — 
all the space "there is — millions 
of planets and eventually other 
galaxies. We don’t have to keep 
making room for new generations, 
the way we would if we were 
stuck on a single world or a sin- 
gle solar system. Immortality, I 
tell you, is the next step for hu- 
manity!” 

“Forget it,” I said curtly, but 
once a Double Eye gets going, 
you can’t shut him up. 

“Look at this planet,” he said. 
“An almost perfect Earth-type 
planet. Main-sequence sun. Good 
soil, good climate, plenty of wa- 
ter — an ideal place for a colony. 
How many years, do you think, 
before Man will settle here?” 



“A thousand. Five thousand. 
Maybe more.” 

“That’s right. And there are 
countless other planets like it, 
planets crying to be settled. But 
we won’t settle them, because we 
keep dying off. And that’s not all 
of it . .” 

OATIENTLY, I listened to all 
the rest — the terrible waste 
of dying — and I knew every bit 
of it by heart. Before Fullerton, 
we’d been saddled by one Double 
Eye fanatic and, before him, yet 
another. It was regulation. Every 
planet-checking team, no matter 
what its purpose or its destina- 
tion, was required to carry as 
supercargo an agent of Immor- 
tality Institute. 

But this kid seemed just a lit- 
tle worse than the usual run of 
them. It was his first trip out and 
he was all steamed up with ideal- 
ism. In all of them, though, 
burned the same intense dedica- 
tion to the proposition that Man 
must live forever and an equally 
unyielding belief that immortal- 
ity could and would be found. 
For had not a lost spaceship 
found the answer centuries be- 
fore — an unnamed spaceship on 
an unknown planet in a long- 
forgotten year! 

It was a myth, of course. It had 
all the hallmarks of one and all 
the fierce loyalty that a myth can 
muster. It was kept alive by Im- 



DROP DEAD 



n 



mortality Institute, operating un- 
der a government grant and bil- 
lions of bequests and gifts from 
hopeful rich and poor — all of 
whom, of course, had died or 
would die in spite of their gener- 
osity. 

“What are you looking for?” I 
asked Fullerton, just a little wear- 
ily, for I was bored with it. “A 
plant? An animal? A people?” 

And he replied, solemn as a 
judge: “That’s something I can’t 
tell you.” 

As if I gave a damn! 

But I went on needling him. 
Maybe it was just something to 
while away my time. That and 
the fact that I disliked the fellow. 
Fanatics annoy me. They won’t 
get off your ear. 

“Would you know it if you 
found it?” 

He didn’t answer that one, but 
he turned haunted eyes on me. 

I cut out the needling. Any 
more of it and I’d have had him 
bawling. 

We sat around a while longer, 
but we did no talking. 

He fished a toothpick out of 
his pocket and put it in his mouth 
and rolled it around, chewing at it 
moodily. I would have liked to 
reach out and slug him, for he 
chewed toothpicks all the time 
and it was an irritating habit 
that set me unreasonably on 
edge. I guess I was jumpy, too. 

Finally he spit out the man- 

12 



gled toothpick and slouched off 
to bed. 

I sat alone, looking up at the 
ship, and the lantern light was 
just bright enough for me to 
make out the legend lettered on 
it: Caph VII — Ag Survey 286, 
which was enough to identify us 
anywhere in the Galaxy. 

For everyone knew Caph VII, 
the agricultural experimental 
planet, just as they would have 
known Aldebaran XII, the medi- 
cal research planet, or Capella 
IX, the university planet, or any 
of the other special departmental 
planets. 

C APH VII is a massive opera- 
tion and the hundreds of 
survey teams like us were just 
a part of it. But we were the 
spearheads who went out to new 
worlds, some of them uncharted, 
some just barely charted, looking 
for plants and animals that might 
be developed on the experimental 
tracts. 

Not that our team had found a 
great deal. We had discovered 
some grasses that did well on 
one of the Eltanian worlds, but 
by and large we hadn’t done any- 
thing that could be called dis- 
tinguished. Our luck just seemed 
to run bad — like that Hamal 
poison ivy business. We worked 
as hard as any of the rest of 
them, but a lot of good that did. 
Sometimes it was tough to take 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



— when all the other teams 
brought in stuff that got them 
written up and earned them bo- 
nuses, while we came creeping in 
with a few piddling grasses or 
maybe not a thing at all. 

It’s a tough life and don’t let 
anyone tell you different. Some 
of the planets turn out to be a 
fairly rugged business. At times, 
the boys come back pretty much 
the worse for wear and there are 
times when they don’t come back 
at all. 

But right now it looked as 
though we’d hit it lucky — a 
peaceful planet, good climate, 
easy terrain, no hostile inhabit- 
ants and no dangerous fauna. 

Weber took his time relieving 
me at guard, but finally he showed 
up. 

I could see he still was goggle- 
eyed about the critter. He walked 
around it several times, looking 
it over. 

“That’s the most fantastic case 
of symbiosis I have ever seen,” he 
said. “If it weren’t lying over 
there. I’d say it was impossible. 
Usually you associate symbiosis 
with the lower, more simple forms 
of life.” 

“You mean that brush grow- 
ing out of it?” 

He nodded. 

“And the bees?” 

He gagged over the bees. 

“How are you so sure it’s sym- 
biosis?” 



He almost wrung his hands. “I 
don’t know,” he admitted. 

T GAVE him the rifle and went 
to the tent I shared with 
Kemper. The bacteriologist was 
awake when I came in. 

“That you. Bob?” 

“It’s me. Everything’s all right.” 

“I’ve been lying here and think- 
ing,” he said. “This is a screwy 
place.” 

“The critters?” 

“No, not the critters. The plan- 
et itself. Never saw one like it. 
It’s positively naked. No trees. 
No flowers. Nothing. It’s just a 
sea of grass.” 

“Why not?” I asked. “Where 
does it say you can’t find a pas- 
ture planet?” 

“It’s too simple,” he protested. 
“Too simplified. Too neat and 
packaged. Almost as if someone 
had said let’s make a simple 
planet, let’s cut out all the frills, 
let’s skip all the biological experi- 
ments and get right down to bas- 
ics. Just one form of life and 
the grass for it to eat.” 

“You’re way out on a limb,” I 
told him. “How do you know all 
this? There may be other life- 
forms. There may be complexi- 
ties we can’t suspect. Sure, all 
we’ve seen are the critters, but 
maybe that’s because there are so 
many of them.” 

“To hell with you,” he said and 
turned over on his cot.

Now there’s a guy I liked. We’d 
been tent partners ever since he’d 
joined the team better than ten 
years before and we got along 
fine. 

Often I had wished the rest 
could get along as well. But it 
was too much to expect. 

The fighting started right after 
breakfast, when Oliver and Web- 
er insisted on using the camp ta- 
ble for dissecting. Parsons, who 
doubled as cook, jumped straight 
down their throats. Why he did 
it, I don’t know. He knew before 
he said a word that he was licked, 
hands down. The same thing had 
happened many times before and 
he knew, no matter what he did 
or said, they would use the table. 

But he put up a good battle. 
“You guys go and find some 
other place to do your butcher- 
ing! Who wants to eat on a table 
that’s all slopped up?” 

“But, Carl, where can we do it? 
We’ll use only one end of the ta- 
ble.” 

Which was a laugh, because in 
half an hour they’d be sprawled 
all over it. 

“Spread out a canvas,” Parsons 
snapped back. 

“You can’t dissect on a canvas. 
You got to have — ” 

“Another thing. How long do 
you figure it will take? In a day 
or two, that critter is going to 
get ripe.” 

It went on like that for quite a 



while, but by the time I started 
up the ladder to get the animals, 
Oliver and Weber had flung the 
critter on the table and were at 
work on it. 

U NSHIPPING the animals is 
something not exactly in 
my line of duty, but over the 
years I’d taken on the job of get- 
ting them unloaded, so they’d be 
there and waiting when Weber or 
some of the others needed them 
to run off a batch of tests. 

I went down into the compart- 
ment where we kept them in 
their cages. The rats started 
squeaking at me and the zartyls 
from Centauri started screeching 
at me and the punkins from Po- 
laris made an unholy racket, be- 
cause the punkins are hungry all 
the time. You just can’t give them 
enough to eat. Turn them loose 
with food and they’d eat them- 
selves to death. 

It was quite a job to get them 
all lugged up to the port and to 
rig up a sling and lower them to 
the ground, but I finally finished 
it without busting a single cage. 
That was an accomplishment. 
Usually I smashed a cage or two 
and some of the animals escaped 
and then Weber would froth 
around for days about my care- 
lessness. 

I had the cages all set out in 
rows and was puttering with can- 
vas flies to protect them from

the weather when Kemper came 
along and stood watching me. 

“I have been wandering 
around,” he announced. From the 
way he said it, I could see he 
had the wind up. 

But I didn’t ask him, for then 
he’d never have told me. Y ou 
had to wait for Kemper to make 
up his mind to talk. 

“Peaceful place,” I said and if 
was all of that. It was a bright, 
clear day and the sun was not 
too warm. There was a little 
breeze and you could see a long 
way off. And it was quiet. Really 
quiet. There wasn’t any noise at 
all. 

“It’s a lonesome place,” said 
Kemper. 

“I don’t get you,” I answered 
patiently. 

“Remember what I said last 
night? About this planet being 
too simplified?” 

He stood watching me put up 
the canvas, as if he might be con- 
sidering how much more to tell 
me. I waited. 

Finally, he blurted it. “Bob, 
there are no insects!” 

“What have insects — ” 

“You know what I mean,” he 
said. “You go out on Earth or 
any Earthlike planet and lie 
down in the grass and watch. 
You’ll see the insects. Some of 
them on the ground and others 
on the grass. There’ll be all kinds 
of them.” 



“And there aren’t any here?” 
He shook his head. “None that 
I could see. I wandered around 
and lay down and looked in a 
dozen different places. Stands to 
reason a man should find some 
insects if he looked all morning. 
It isn’t natural. Bob.” 

T KEPT on with my canvas 
and I don’t know why it 
was, but I got a little chilled 
about there not being any insects. 
Not that I care a hoot for insects, 
but as Kemper said, it was un- 
natural, although you come to 
expect the so-called unnatural in 
this planet-checking business. 
“There are the bees,” I said. 
“What bees?” 

“The ones that are in the crit- 
ters. Didn’t you see any?” 

“None,” he said. “I didn’t get 
close to any critter herds. Maybe 
the bees don’t travel very far.” 
“Any birds?” 

“I didn’t see a one,” he said. 
“But I was wrong about the flow- 
ers. The grass has tiny flowers.” 
“For the bees to work on.” 
Kemper’s face went stony. 
“That’s right. Don’t you see the 
pattern of it, the planned — ” 

“I see it,” I told him. 

He helped me with the canvas 
and we didn’t say much more. 
When we had it done, we walked 
into camp. 

Parsons was cooking lunch and 
grumbling at Oliver and Weber,

but they weren’t paying much at- 
tention to him. They had the ta- 
ble littered with different parts 
they’d carved out of the critter 
and they were looking slightly 
numb. 

“No brain,” Weber said to us 
accusingly, as if we might have 
made off with it when he wasn’t 
looking. “We can’t find a brain 
and there’s no nervous system.” 
“It’s impossible,” declared Oli- 
ver. “How can a highly organized, 
complex animal exist without a 
brain or nervous system?” 

“Look at that butcher shop!” 
Parsons yelled wrathfully from 
the stove. “You guys will have to 
eat standing up!” 

“Butcher shop is right,” Weber 
agreed. “As near as we can figure 
out, there are at least a dozen 
different kinds of flesh — some 
fish, some fowl, some good red 
meat. Maybe a little lizard, even.” 
“An all-purpose animal,” said 
Kemper. “Maybe we found some- 
thing finally.” 

“If it’s edible,” Oliver added. 
“If it doesn’t poison you. If it 
doesn’t grow hair all over you.” 
“That’s up to you,” I told him. 
“I got the cages down and all 
lined up. You can start killing off 
the little cusses to your heart’s 
content.” 

Weber looked ruefully at the 
mess on the table. 

“We did just a rough explora- 
tory job,” he explained. “We 

16 



ought to start another one from 
scratch. You’ll have to get in on 
that next one, Kemper.” 

Kemper nodded glumly. 
Weber looked at me. “Think 
you can get us one?” 

“Sure,” I said. “No trouble.” 

It wasn’t. 

Right after lunch, a lone crit- 
ter came walking up, as if to 
visit us. It stopped about six 
feet from where we sat, gazed at 
us soulfully, then obligingly 
dropped dead. 

¥~kURING the next few days, 
Oliver and Weber barely 
took time out to eat and sleep. 
They sliced and probed. They 
couldn’t believe half the things 
they found. They argued. They 
waved their scalpels in the air to 
emphasize their anguish. They 
almost broke down and wept. 
Kemper filled box after box with 
slides and sat hunched, half pet- 
rified, above his microscope. 

Parsons and I wandered around 
while the others worked. He dug 
up some soil samples and tried 
to classify the grasses and failed, 
because there weren’t any grasses 
— there was just one type of 
grass. He made notes on the 
weather and ran an analysis of 
the air and tried to pull together 
an ecological report without a 
lot to go on. 

I looked for insects and I didn’t 
find any except the bees and I

never saw those unless I was near 
a critter herd. I watched for birds 
and there were none. I spent two 
days investigating a creek, lying 
on my belly and staring down 
into the water, and there were 
no signs of life. I hunted up a 
sugar sack and put a hoop in 
the mouth of it and spent another 
two days seining. I didn’t catch 
a thing — not a fish, not even a 
crawdad, not a single thing. 

By that time, 1 was ready to 
admit that Kemper had guessed 
right. 

Fullerton walked around, too, 
but we paid no attention to him. 
All the Double Eyes, every one 
of them, always were looking for 
something no one else could see. 
After a while, you got pretty tired 
of them. I’d spent twenty years 
getting tired of them. 

The last day I went seining, 
Fullerton stumbled onto me late 
in the afternoon. He stood up on 
the bank and watched me work- 
ing in a pool. When I looked up, 
I had the feeling he’d been watch- 
ing me for quite a little while. 

“There’s nothing there,” he 
said. 

The way he said it, he made it 
sound as if he’d known all along 
there was nothing there and that 
I was a fool for looking. 

But that wasn’t the only reason 
I got sore. 

Sticking out of his face, in- 
stead of the usual toothpick, was 



a stem of grass and he was rolling 
it around in his lips and chewing 
it the way he chewed the tooth- 
picks. 

“Spit out that grass!” I shouted 
at him. “You fool, spit it out!” 

TT IS eyes grew startled and 
he spit out the grass. 

“It’s hard to remember,” he 
mumbled. “You see, it’s my first 
trip out and — ” 

“It could be your last one, too,” 
I told him brutally. “Ask Weber 
sometime, when you have a mo- 
ment, what happened to the guy 
who pulled a leaf and chewed it. 
Absent-minded, sure. Habit, cer- 
tainly. He was just as dead as if 
he’d committed suicide.” 

Fullerton stiffened up. 

“I’ll keep it in mind,” he said. 

I stood there, looking up at 
him, feeling a little sorry that I’d 
been so tough with him. 

But I had to be. There were 
so many absent-minded, well-in- 
tentioned ways a man could kill 
himself. 

“You find anything?” I asked. 

“I’ve been watching the crit- 
ters,” he said. “There was some- 
thing funny that I couldn’t quite 
make out at first . .” 

“I can list you a hundred funny 
things.” 

“That’s not what I mean, Sut- 
ter. Not the patchwork color or 
the bushes growing out of them. 
There was something else. I fi-

nally got it figured out. There 
aren't any young.” 

Fullerton was right, of course. 
I realized it now, after he had 
told me. There weren’t any calves 
or whatever you might call them. 
All we’d seen were adults. And 
yet that didn’t necessarily mean 
there weren’t any calves. It just 
meant we hadn’t seen them. And 
the same, I knew, applied as well 
to insects, birds and fish. They all 
might be on the planet, but we 
just hadn’t managed to find them 
yet. 

And then, belatedly, I got it — 
the inference, the hope, the half- 
crazy fantasy behind this thing 
that Fullerton had found, or im- 
agined he’d found. 

“You’re downright loopy,” I 
said flatly. 

He stared back at me and his 
eyes were shining like a kid’s at 
Christmas. 

He said: “It had to happen 
sometime, Sutter, somewhere.” 

I climbed up the bank and 
stood beside him. I looked at the 
net I still held in my hands and 
threw it back into the creek and 
watched it sink. 

“Be sensible,” I warned him. 
“You have no evidence. Immor- 
tality wouldn’t work that way. It 
couldn’t. That way, it would be 
nothing but a dead end. Don’t 
mention it to anyone. They’d ride 
you without mercy all the way 
back home.” 

18 



1 DON’T know why I wasted 
time on him. He stared back 
at me stubbornly, but still with 
that awful light of hope and tri- 
umph on his face. 

“I’ll keep my mouth shut,” I 
told him curtly. “I won’t say a 
word.” 

“Thanks, Sutter,” he answered. 
“I appreciate it a lot.” 

I knew from the way he said 
it that he could murder me with 
gusto. 

We trudged back to camp. 
The camp was all slicked up. 
The dissecting mess had been 
cleared away and the table had 
been scrubbed so hard that it 
gleamed. Parsons was cooking 
supper and singing one of his ob- 
scene ditties. The other three sat 
around in their camp chairs and 
they had broken out some liquor 
and were human once again. 

“All buttoned up?” I asked, but 
Oliver shook his head. 

They poured a drink for Ful- 
lerton and he accepted it, a bit 
ungraciously, but he did take it. 
That was some improvement on 
the usual Double Eye. 

They didn’t offer me any. They 
knew I couldn’t drink it. 

“What have we got?” I asked. 
“It could be something good,” 
said Oliver. “It’s a walking menu. 
It’s an all-purpose animal, for 
sure. It lays eggs, gives milk, 
makes honey. It has six different 
kinds of red meat, two of fowl, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



one of fish and a couple of others 
we can’t identify.” 

“Lays eggs,” I said. “Gives milk. 
Then it reproduces.” 

“Certainly,” said Weber. “What 
did you think?” 

“There aren’t any young.” 
Weber grunted. “Could be they 
have nursery areas. Certain places 
instinctively set aside in which to 
rear their young.” 

“Or they might have instinctive 
birth control,” suggested Oliver. 
“That would fit in with the per- 
fectly balanced ecology Kemper 
talks about.” 

Weber snorted. “Ridiculous!” 
“Not so ridiculous,” Kemper re- 
torted. “Not half so ridiculous as 
some other things we found. Not 
one-tenth as ridiculous as no brain 
or nervous system. Not any more 
ridiculous than my bacteria.” 
“Your bacteria!” Weber said. 
He drank down half a glass of 
liquor in a single gulp to make his 
disdain emphatic. 

“The critters swarm with 
them,” Kemper went on. “You 
find them everywhere throughout 
the entire animal. Not just in the 
bloodstream, not in restricted 
areas, but in the entire organism. 
And all of them the same. Nor- 
mally it takes a hundred different 
kinds of bacteria to make a me- 
tabolism work, but here there’s 
only one. And that one, by defini- 
tion, must be general purpose — 
it must do all the work that the 



hundred other species do.” 

He grinned at Weber. “I 
wouldn’t doubt but right there are 
your brains and nervous systems 
— the bacteria doubling in brass 
for both systems.” 

13 ARSONS came over from the 
stove and stood with his fists 
planted on his hips, a steak fork 
grasped in one hand and sticking 
out at a tangent from his body. 

“If you ask me,” he announced, 
“there ain’t no such animal. The 
critters are all wrong. They can’t 
be made that way.” 

“But they are,” said Kemper. 
“It doesn’t make sense! One 
kind of life. One kind of grass for 
it to eat. I’ll bet that if we could 
make a census, we’d find the crit- 
ter population is at exact capac- 
ity — just so many of them to 
the acre, figured down precisely 
to the last mouthful of grass. Just 
enough for them to eat and no 
more. Just enough so the grass 
won’t be overgrazed. Or under- 
grazed, for that matter.” 

“What’s wrong with that?” I 
asked, just to needle him. 

I thought for a minute he’d 
take the steak fork to me. 

“What’s wrong with it?” he 
thundered. “Nature’s never static, 
never standing still. But here it’s 
standing still. Where’s the com- 
petition? Where’s the evolution?” 
“That’s not the point,” said 
Kemper quietly. “The fact is that

that’s the way it is. The point is 
why? How did it happen? How 
was it planned? Why was it 
planned?” 

“Nothing’s planned,” Weber 
told him sourly. “You know bet- 
ter than to talk like that.” 

Parsons went back to his cook- 
ing. Fullerton had wandered off 
somewhere. Maybe he was dis- 
couraged from hearing about the 
eggs and milk. 

For a time, the four of us just 
sat. 

Finally Weber said: “The first 
night we were here, I came out to 
relieve Bob at guard and I said 
to him . 

He looked at me. “You remem- 
ber, Bob?” 

“Sure. You said symbiosis.” 

“And now?” asked Kemper. 

“I don’t know. It simply 
couldn’t happen. But if I did — if 
it could — this critter would be 
the most beautifully logical ex- 
ample of symbiosis you could 
dream up. Symbiosis carried to 
its logical conclusion. Like, long 
ago, all the life-forms said let’s 
quit this feuding, let’s get togeth- 
er, let’s cooperate. All the plants 
and animals and fish and bacteria 
got together — ” 

“It’s far-fetched, of course,” 
said Kemper. “But, by and large, 
it’s not anything unheard of, 
merely carried further, that’s all. 
Symbiosis is a recognized way of 
life and there’s nothing- — ” 



Parsons let out a bellow for 
them to come and get it, and I 
went to my tent and broke out 
my diet kit and mixed up a mess 
of goo. It was a relief to eat in 
private, without the others mak- 
ing cracks about the stuff I had 
to choke down. 

I FOUND a thin sheaf of work- 
ing notes on the small wood- 
en crate I’d set up for a desk. I 
thumbed through them while I 
ate. They were fairly -sketchy and 
sometimes hard to read, being 
smeared with blood and other 
gook from the dissecting table. 
But I was used to that. I worked 
with notes like that all the blessed 
time. So I was able to decipher 
them. 

The whole picture wasn’t there, 
of course, but there was enough 
to bear out what they’d told me 
and a good deal more as well. 

For examples, the color squares 
that gave the critters their crazy- 
quiltish look were separate kinds 
of meat or fish or fowl or unknown 
food, whatever it might be. Almost 
as if each square was the present- 
day survivor of each ancient sym- 
biont — if, in fact, there was any 
basis to this talk of symbiosis. 

The egg-laying apparatus was 
described in some biologic detail, 
but there seemed to be no evi- 
dence of recent egg production. 
The same was true of the lacta- 
tion system. 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There were, the notes said in 
Oliver’s crabbed writing, five 
kinds of fruit and three kinds of 
vegetables to be derived from the 
plants growing from the critters. 

I shoved the notes to one side 
and sat back on my chair, gloat- 
ing just a little. 

Here was diversified farming 
with a vengeance! You had meat 
and dairy herds, fish pond, aviary, 
poultry yard, orchard and garden 
rolled into one, all in the body of 
a single animal that was a com- 
plete farm in itself! 

I went through the notes hur- 
riedly again and found what I was 
looking for. The food product 
seemed high in relation to the 
gross weight pf the animal. Very 
little would be lost in dressing 
out. 

That is the kind of thing an ag 
economist has to consider. But 
that isn’t all of it, by any means. 
What if a man couldn’t eat the 
critter? Suppose the critters 
couldn’t be moved off the planet 
because they died if you took 
them from their range? 

I recalled how they’d just 
walked up and died; that in itself 
was another headache to be filed 
for future worry. 

What if they could only eat 
the grass that grew on this one 
planet? And if so, could the grass 
be grown elsewhere? What kind 
of tolerance would the critter 
show to different kinds of cli- 



mate? What was the rate of re- 
production? If it was slow, as was 
indicated, could it be stepped up? 
What was the rate of growth? 

I got up and walked out of the 
tent and stood fjor a while, out- 
side. The little breeze that had 
been blowing had died down at 
sunset and the place was quiet. 
Quiet because there was nothing 
but the critters to make any noise 
and we had yet to hear them 
make a single sound. The stars 
blazed overhead and there were 
so many of them that they lighted 
up the countryside as if there 
were a moon. 

I walked over to where the rest 
of the men were sitting. 

“It looks like we’ll be here for 
a while,” I said. “Tomorrow we 
might as well get the ship un- 
loaded.” 

TVO ONE answered me, but in 

’ the silence I could sense 
the half-hidden satisfaction and 
the triumph. At last we’d hit the 
jackpot! We’d be going home with 
something that would make those 
other teams look pallid. We’d be 
the ones who got the notices and 
bonuses. 

Oliver finally broke the silence. 
“Some of our animals aren’t in 
good shape. I went down this aft- 
ernoon to have a look at them. A 
couple of the pigs and several of 
the rats.” 

He looked at me accusingly. 



DROP DEAD

I flared up at him. “Don’t look 
at me! I’m not their keeper. I 
just take care of them until you’re 
ready to use them.” 

Kemper butted in to head off 
an argument. “Before we do any 
feeding, we’ll need another crit- 
ter.” 

“I’ll lay you a bet,” said Weber. 

Kemper didn’t take him up. 

It was just as well he didn’t, 
for a critter came in, right after 
breakfast, and died with a savoir 
iaire that was positively marvel- 
ous. They went to work on it im- 
mediately. 

Parsons and I started unload- 
ing the supplies. We put in a busy 
day. We moved all the food ex- 
cept the emergency rations we 
left in the ship. We slung down a 
refrigerating unit Weber had been 
yelling for, to keep the critter 
products fresh. We unloaded a lot 
of equipment and some silly odds 
and ends that I knew we’d have 
no use for, but that some of the 
others wanted broken out. We put 
up tents and we lugged and 
pushed and hauled all day. Late 
in the afternoon, we had it all 
stacked up and under canvas and 
were completely bushed. 

Kemper went back to his bac- 
teria. Weber spent hours with the 
animals. Oliver dug up a bunch of 
grass and gave the grass the 
works. Parsons went out on field 
trips, mumbling and fretting. 

Of all of us. Parsons had the 



job that was most infuriating. Or- 
dinarily the ecology of even the 
simplest of planets is a compli- 
cated business and there’s a lot of 
work to do. But here was almost 
nothing. There was no competi- 
tion for survival. There was no 
dog eat dog. There were just crit- 
ters cropping grass. 

I started to pull my report to- 
gether, knowing that it would 
have to be revised and rewritten 
again and again. But I was anx- 
ious to get going. I fairly itched 
to see the pieces fall together — 
although I knew from the very 
start some of them wouldn’t fit. 
They almost never do. 

Things went well. Too well, it 
sometimes seemed to me. 

There were incidents, of course, 
like when the punkins somehow 
chewed their way out of their 
cage and disappeared. 

Weber was almost beside him- 
self. 

“They’ll come back,” said Kem- 
per. “With that appetite of theirs, 
they won’t stay away for long.” 

A ND he was right about that 
part of it. The punkins 
were the hungriest creatures in 
the Galaxy. You could never feed 
them enough to satisfy them. And 
they’d eat anything. It made no 
difference to them, just so there 
was a lot of it. 

And it was that very factor in 
their metabolism that made them 



22

invaluable as research animals. 

The other animals thrived on 
the critter diet. The carnivorous 
ones ate the critter-meat and the 
vegetarians chomped on critter- 
fruit and critter-vegetables. They 
all grew sleek and sassy. They 
seemed in better health than the 
control animals, which continued 
their regular diet. Even the pigs 
and rats that had been sick got 
well again and as fat and happy 
as any of the others. 

Kemper told us, “This critter 
stuff is more than just a food. It’s 
a medicine. I can see the signs: 
‘Eat Critter and Keep Well!’” 

Weber grunted at him. He was 
never one for joking and I think he 
was a worried man. A thorough 
man, he’d found too many things 
that violated all the tenets he’d 
accepted as the truth. No brain or 
nervous system. The ability to die 
at will. The lingering hint of 
wholesale symbiosis. And the 
bacteria. 

The bacteria, I think, must 
have seemed to him the worst of 
all. 

There was, it now appeared, 
only one type involved. Kemper 
had hunted frantically and had 
discovered no others. Oliver 
found it in the grass. Parsons 
found it in the soil and water. 
The air, strangely enough, seemed 
to be free of it. 

But Weber wasn’t the only one 
who worried. Kemper worried. 



too. He unloaded most of it just 
before our bedtime, sitting on the 
edge of his cot and trying to talk 
the worry out of himself while I 
worked on my reports. 

And he’d picked the craziest 
point imaginable to pin his worry 
on. 

can explain it all,” he 
said, “if you are only will- 
ing to concede on certain points. 
You can explain the critters if 
you’re willing to believe in a sym- 
biotic arrangement carried out on 
a planetary basis. You can believe 
in the utter simplicity of the ecol- 
ogy if you’re willing to assume 
that, given space and time 
enough, anything can happen 
within the bounds of logic. 

“You can visualize how the bac- 
teria might take the place of 
brains and nervous systems if 
you’re ready to say this is a bac- 
terial world and not a critter 
world. And you can even envision 
the bacteria — all of them, every 
single one of them — as forming 
one gigantic linked intelligence. 
And if you accept that theory, 
then the voluntary deaths become 
understandable, because there’s 
no 'actual death involved — it’s 
just like you or me trimming off 
a hangnail. And if this is true, 
then Fullerton has found immor- 
tality, although it’s not the kind 
he was looking for and it won’t 
do him or us a single bit of good.

“But the thing that worries 
me,” he went on, his face all knot- 
ted up with worry, “is the seeming 
lack of anything resembling a de- 
fense mechanism. Even assuming 
that the critters are no more than 
fronting for a bacterial world, the 
mechanism should be there as a 
simple matter of precaution. Ev- 
ery living thing we know of has 
some sort of way to defend itself 
or to escape potential enemies. It 
either fights or runs and hides to 
preserve its life.” 

He was right, of course. Not 
only did the critters have no de- 
fense, they even saved one the 
trouble of going out to kill them. 

“Maybe we are wrong,” Kem- 
per concluded. “Maybe life, after 
all, is not as valuable as we think 
it is. Maybe it’s not a thing to 
cling to. Maybe it’s not worth 
fighting for. Maybe the critters, 
in their dying, are closer to the 
truth than we.” 

It would go on like that, night 
after night, with Kemper talking 
around in circles and never get- 
ting anywhere. I think most of 
the time he wasn’t talking to me, 
but talking to himself, trying by 
the very process of putting it in 
words to work out some final an- 
swer. 

And long after we had turned 
out the lights and gone to bed, I’d 
lie on my cot and think about all 
that Kemper said and I thought 
in circles, too. I wondered why all 

24 



the critters that came in and died 
were in the prime of life. Was 
the dying a privilege that was ac- 
corded only to the fit? Or were all 
the critters in the prime of life? 
Was there really some cause to 
believe they might be immortal? 

I asked a lot of questions, but 
there weren’t any answers. 

We continued with our work. 
Weber killed some of his animals 
and examined them and there 
were no signs of ill effect from the 
critter diet. There were traces of 
critter bacteria in their blood, but 
no sickness, reaction or antibody 
formation. Kemper kept on with 
his bacterial work. Oliver started 
a whole series of experiments 
with the grass. Parsons just gave 
up. 

The punkins didn’t come back 
and Parsons and Fullerton went 
out and hunted for them, but 
without success. 

1 WORKED on my report and 
the pieces fell together better 
than I had hoped they would. 

It began to look as though we 
had the situation well nailed 
down. 

We all were feeling pretty 
good. We could almost taste that 
bonus. 

But I think that, in the back of 
our minds, all of us were wonder- 
ing if we could get away scot 
free. I know I had mental fingers 
crossed. It just didn’t seem quite 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



possible that something wouldn’t 
happen. 

And, of course, it did. 

We were sitting around after 
supper, with the lantern lighted, 
when we heard the sound. I real- 
ized afterward that we had been 
hearing it for some time before 
we paid attention to it. It started 
so soft and so far away that it 
crept upon us without alarming 
us. At first, it sounded like a sigh- 
ing, as if a gentle wind were blow- 
ing through a little tree, and then 
it changed into a rumble, but a 
far-off rumble that had no men- 
ace in it. I was just getting ready 
to say something about thunder 
and wondering if our stretch of 
weather was about to break when 
Kemper jumped up and yelled. 

I don’t know what he yelled. 
Maybe it wasn’t a word at all. 
But the way he yelled brought 
us to our feet and sent us at a 
dead run for the safety of the 
ship. Even before we got there, 
in the few seconds it took to 
reach the ladder, the character of 
the sound had changed and there 
was no mistaking what it was — 
the drumming of hoofs heading 
straight for camp. 

They were almost on top of 
us when we reached the ladder 
and there wasn’t time or room 
for all of use to use it. I was the 
last in line and I saw I’d never 
make it and a dozen possible es- 
cape plans flickered through my 



mind. But I knew they wouldn’t 
work fast enough. Then I saw the 
rope, hanging where I’d left it 
after the unloading job, and I 
made a jump for it. I’m no rope- 
climbing expert, but I shinnied 
up it with plenty of speed. And 
right behind me came Weber, 
who was no rope-climber, either, 
but who was doing rather well. 

I thought of how lucky it had 
been that I hadn’t found the time 
to take down the rig and how 
Weber had ridden me unmerci- 
fully about not doing it. I wanted 
to shout down and point it out 
to him, but I didn’t have the 
breath. 

We reached the port and tum- 
bled into it. Below us, the stam- 
peding critters went grinding 
through the camp. There seemed 
to be millions of them. One of 
the terrifying things about it was 
how silently they ran. They made 
no outcry of any kind; all you 
could hear was the sound of their 
hoofs pounding on the ground. It 
seemed almost as if they ran in 
some blind fury that was too deep 
for outcry. 

^ I HEY spread for miles, as far 
-*■ as one could see on the star- 
lit plains, but the spaceship di- 
vided them and they flowed to 
either side of it and then flowed 
back again, and beyond the space- 
ship there was a little sector that 
they never touched. I thought 



DROP DEAD 



25 



how we could have been safe 
staying on the ground and hud- 
dling in that sector, but that’s 
one of the things a man never can 
foresee. 

The stampede lasted for al- 
most an hour. When it was all 
over, we came down and sur- 
veyed the damage. The animals 
in their cages, lined up between 
the ship and the camp, were safe. 
All but one of the sleeping tents 
were standing. The lantern still 
burned brightly on the table. But 
everything else was gone. Our 
food supply was trampled in the 
ground. Much of the equipment 
was lost and wrecked. On either 
side of the camp, the ground was 
churned up like a half-plowed 
field. The whole thing was a mess. 
It looked as if we were licked. 
The tent Kemper and I used 
for sleeping still stood, so our 
notes were safe. The animals were 
all right. But that was all we had 
— -the notes and animals. 

“I need three more weeks,” said 
Weber. “Give me just three 
weeks to complete the tests.” 
“We haven’t got three weeks,” 
I answered. “All our food is gone.” 
“The emergency rations in the 
ship?” 

“That’s for going home.” 

“We can go a little hungry.” 
He glared at us — at each of 
us in turn — challenging us to do 
a little starving. 

“I can go three weeks,” he said, 



“without any food at all.” 

“We could eat critter,” suggest- 
ed Parsons. “We could take a 
chance.” 

Weber shook his head. “Not 
yet. In three weeks, when the 
tests are finished, then maybe we 
will know. Maybe we won’t need 
those rations for going home. 
Maybe we can stock up on crit- 
ters and eat our heads off all the 
way to Caph.” 

I looked around at the rest of 
them, but I knew, before I looked, 
the answer I would get. 

“All right,” I said. “We’ll try 
it.” 

“It’s all right for you,” Fuller- 
ton retorted hastily. “You have 
your diet kit.” 

Parsons reached out and 
grabbed him and shook him so 
hard that he went cross-eyed. “We 
don’t talk like that about those 
diet kits.” 

Then Parsons let him go. 

E SET up double guards, for 
** the stampede had wrecked 
our warning system, but none of 
us got much sleep. We were too 
upset. 

Personally, I did some worry- 
ing about why the critters had 
stampeded. There was nothing on 
the planet that could scare them. 
There were no other animals. 
There was no thunder or light- 
ning — as a matter of fact, it ap- 
peared that the planet might have 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



no boisterous weather ever. And 
there seemed to be nothing in the 
critter makeup, from our obser- 
vation of them, that would set 
them off emotionally. 

But there must be a reason and 
a purpose, I told myself. And 
there must be, too, in their drop- 
ping dead for us. But was the pur- 
pose intelligence or instinct? 

That was what bothered me 
most. It kept me awake all night 
long. 



At daybreak, a critter walked 
in and died for us happily. 

We went without our breakfast 
and, when noon came, no one 
said anything about lunch, so we 
skipped that, too. 

Late in the afternoon, I climbed 
the ladder to get some food for 
supper. There wasn’t any. In- 
stead, I found five of the fattest 
punkins you ever laid your eyes 
on. They had chewed holes 
through the packing boxes and

27 



the food was cleaned out. The 
sacks were limp and empty. 
They’d even managed to get the 
lid off the coffee can somehow 
and had eaten every bean. 

The five of them sat content- 
edly in a corner, blinking smugly 
at me. They didn’t make a racket, 
as they usually did. Maybe they 
knew they were in the wrong or 
maybe they were just too full. 
For once, perhaps, they’d gotten 
all they could eat. 

I just stood there and looked 
at them and I knew how they’d 
gotten on the ship. I blamed my- 
self, not them. If only I’d found 
the time to take down the unload- 
ing rig, they’d never gotten in. 
But then I remembered how that 
dangling rope had saved my life 
and Weber’s and I couldn’t de- 
cide whether I’d done right or 
wrong. 

I went over to the corner and 
picked the punkins up. I stuffed 
three of them in my pockets and 
carried the other two. I climbed 
down from the ship and walked 
up to camp. I put the punkins on 
the table. 

“Here they are,” I said. “They 
were in the ship. That’s why we 
couldn’t find them. They climbed 
up the rope.” 

Weber took one look at them. 
“They look well fed. Did they 
leave anything?” 

“Not a scrap. They cleaned us 
out entirely.” 

28 



The punkins were quite happy. 
It was apparent they were glad 
to be back with us again. After 
all, they’d eaten everything in 
reach and there was no further 
reason for their staying in the 
ship. 

T)ARSONS picked up a knife 
and walked over to the crit- 
ter that had died that morning. 

“Tie on your bibs,” he said. 

He carved out big steaks and 
threw them on the table and then 
he lit his stove. I retreated to my 
tent as soon as he started cook- 
ing, for never in my life have I 
smelled anything as good as those 
critter steaks. 

I broke out the kit and mixed 
me up some goo and sat there 
eating it, feeling sorry for myself. 

Kemper came in after a while 
and sat down on his cot. 

“Do you want to hear?” he 
asked me. 

“Go ahead,” I invited him re- 
signedly. 

“It’s wonderful. It’s got every- 
thing you’ve ever eaten backed 
clear off the table. We had three 
different kinds of red meat and a 
slab of fish and something that 
resembled lobster, only better. 
And there’s one kind of fruit 
growing out of that bush in the 
middle of the back . .” 

“And tomorrow you drop 
dead.” 

“I don’t think so,” Kemper said. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The animals have been thriving 
on it. There’s nothing wrong with 
them.” 

It seemed that Kemper was 
right. Between the animals and 
men, it took a critter a day. The 
critters didn’t seem to mind. They 
were johnny-on-the-spot. They 
walked in promptly, one at a 
time, and keeled over every 
morning. 

The way the men and animals 
ate was positively indecent. Par- 
sons cooked great platters of dif- 
ferent kinds of meat and fish and 
fowl and what-not. He prepared 
huge bowls of vegetables. He 
heaped other bowls with fruit. He 
racked up combs of honey and 
the men licked the platters clean. 
They sat around with belts un- 
loosened and patted their bulging 
bellies and were disgustingly con- 
tented. 

I waited for them to break out 
in a rash or to start turning green 
with purple spots or grow scales 
or something of the sort. But 
nothing happened. They thrived, 
just as the animals were thriving. 
They felt better than they ever 
had. 

Then, one morning, Fullerton 
turned up sick. He lay on his cot 
flushed with fever. It looked like 
Centaurian virus, although we’d 
been inoculated against that. In 
fact, we’d been inoculated and 
immunized against almost every- 
thing. Each time, before we blast- 



ed off on another survey, they 
jabbed us full of booster shots. 

I didn’t think much of it. I was 
fairly well convinced, for a time 
at least, that all that was wrong 
with him was overeating. 

O LIVER, who knew a little 
about medicine, but not 
much, got the medicine chest out 
of the ship and pumped Fullerton 
full of some new antibiotic that 
came highly recommended for al- 
most everything. 

We went on with our work, ex- 
pecting he’d be on his feet in a 
day or two. 

But he wasn’t. If anything, he 
got worse. 

Oliver went through the medi- 
cine chest, reading all the labels 
carefully, but didn’t find anything 
that seemed to be the proper 
medication. He read the first-aid 
booklet. It didn’t tell him any- 
thing except how to set broken 
legs or apply artificial respiration 
and simple things like that. 

Kemper had been doing a lot 
of worrying, so he had Oliver take 
a sample of Fullerton’s blood and 
then prepared a slide. When he 
looked at the blood through the 
microscope, he found that it 
swarmed with bacteria from the 
critters. Oliver took some more 
blood samples and Kemper pre- 
pared more slides, just to double- 
check, and there was no doubt 
about it.

By this time, all of us were 
standing around the table watch- 
ing Kemper and waiting for the 
verdict. I know the same thing 
must have been in the mind of 
each of us. 

It was Oliver who put it into 
words. “Who is next?” he asked. 

Parsons stepped up and Oliver 
took the sample. 

We waited anxiously. 

Finally Kemper straightened 

“You have them, too,” he said 
to Parsons. “Not as high a count 
as Fullerton.” 

Man after man stepped up. All 
of us had the bacteria, but in my 
case the count was low. 

“It’s the critter,” Parsons said. 
“Bob hasn’t been eating any.” 

“But cooking kills — ” Oliver 
started to say. 

“You can’t be sure. These bac- 
teria would have to be highly 
adaptable. They do the work of 
thousands of other micro-organ- 
isms. They’re a sort of handy- 
man," a jack-of-all-trades. They 
can acclimatize. They can meet 
new situations. They haven’t 
weakened the strain by becoming 
specialized.” 

“Besides,” said Parsons, “we 
don’t cook all of it. We don’t cook 
the fruit and most of you guys 
raise hell if a steak is more than 
singed.” 

“What I can’t figure out is why 
it should be Fullerton,” Weber 
said. “Why should his count be 

30 



higher? He started on the critter 
the same time as the rest of us.” 
I remembered that day down 
by the creek. 

“He got a head start on the 
rest of you,” I explained. “He ran 
out of toothpicks and took to 
chewing grass stems. I caught 
him at it.” 

1 KNOW it wasn’t very com- 
forting. It meant that in an- 
other week or two, all of them 
would have as high a count as 
Fullerton. But there was no sense 
not telling them. It would have 
been criminal not to. There was 
no place for wishful thinking in a 
situation like that. 

“We can’t stop eating critter,” 
said Weber. “It’s all the food we 
have. There’s nothing we can do.” 
“I have a hunch,” Kemper re- 
plied, “it’s too late anyhow.” 

“If we started home right now,” 
I said, “there’s my diet kit . .” 
They didn’t let me finish mak- 
ing my offer. They slapped me on 
the back and pounded one an- 
other and laughed like mad. 

It wasn’t that funny. They just 
needed something they could 
laugh at. 

“It wouldn’t do any good,” said 
Kemper. “We’ve already had it. 
Anyhow, your diet kit wouldn’t 
last us all the way back home.” 
“We could have a try at it,” I 
argued. 

“It may be just a transitory 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing,” Parsons said. “Just a bit of 
fever. A little upset from a change 
of diet.” 

We all hoped that, of course. 

But Fullerton got no better. 

Weber took blood samples of 
the animals and they had a bac- 
terial count almost as high as 
Fullerton’s — much higher than 
when he’d taken it before. 

Weber blamed himself. “I 
should have kept closer check. I 
should have taken tests every day 
or so.” 

“What difference would it have 
made?” demande'd Parsons. “Even 
if you had, even if you’d found a 
lot of bacteria in the blood, we’d 
still have eaten critter. There was 
no other choice.” 

“Maybe it’s not the bacteria,” 
said Oliver. “We may be jumping 
at conclusions. It may be some- 
thing else that Fullerton picked 
up.” 

Weber brightened up a bit. 
“That’s right. The animals still 
seem to be okay.” 

They were bright and chipper, 
in the best of health. 

We waited. Fullerton got nei- 
ther worse nor better. 

Then, one night, he disap- 
peared. 

Oliver, who had been sitting 
with him, had dozed off for a mo- 
ment. Parsons, on guard, had 
heard nothing. 

We hunted for him for three 
full days. He couldn’t have gone 



far, we figured. He had wandered 
off in a delirium and he didn’t 
have the strength to cover any 
distance. 

But we didn’t find him. 

W E DID find one queer thing, 
however. It was a ball of 
some strange substance, white 
and fresh-appearing. It was about 
four feet in diameter. It lay at 
the bottom of a little gully, hid- 
den out of sight, as if someone or 
something might have brought it 
there and hidden it away. 

We did some cautious poking 
at it and we rolled it back and 
forth a little and wondered what 
it was, but we were hunting Ful- 
lerton and we didn’t have the 
time to do much investigating. 
Later on, we agreed, we would 
come back and get it and find out 
what it was. 

Then the animals came down 
with the fever, one after another 
— all except the controls, which 
had been eating regular food un- 
til the stampede had destroyed 
the supply. After that, of course, 
all of them ate critter. 

By the end of two days, most 
of the animals were down. 

Weber worked with them, 
scarcely taking time to rest. We 
all helped as best we could. 

Blood samples showed a great- 
er concentration of bacteria. 
Weber started a dissection, but 
never finished it. Once he got the 



DROP DEAD 



31 



animal open, he took a quick 
look at it and scraped the whole 
thing off the table into a pail. I 
saw him, but I don’t think any of 
the others did. We were pretty 
busy. 

I asked him about it later in 
the day, when we were alone for 
a moment. He briskly brushed me 
off. 

I went to bed early that night 
because I had the second guard. 
It seemed I had no more than 
shut my eyes when I was brought 
upright by a racket that raised 
goose pimples on every inch of 
me. 

I tumbled out of bed and 
scrabbled around to find my 
shoes and get them on. By that 
time, Kemper had dashed out of 
the tent. 

There was trouble with the ani- 
mals. They were fighting to break 
out, chewing the bars of their 
cages and throwing themselves 
against them in a blind and terri- 
ble frenzy. And all the time they 
were squealing and screaming. To 
listen to them set your teeth on 
edge. 

Weber dashed around with a 
hypodermic. After what seemed 
hours, we had them full of seda- 
tive. A few of them broke loose 
and got away, but the rest were 
sleeping peacefully. 

I got a gun and took over 
guard duty while the other men 
went back to bed. 

32 



1 STAYED down near the 
cages, walking back and 
forth because I was too tense to 
do much sitting down. It seemed 
to me that between the animals’ 
frenzy to escape and Fullerton’s 
disappearance, there was a paral- 
lel that was too similar for com- 
fort. 

I tried to review all that had 
happened on the planet and I got 
bogged down time after time as 
I tried to make the picture dove- 
tail. The trail of thought I fol- 
lowed kept turning back to Kem- 
per’s worry about the critters’ 
lack of a defense mechanism. 

Maybe, I told myself, they had 
a defense mechanism, after all — 
the slickest, smoothest, trickiest 
one Man ever had encountered. 

As soon as the camp awoke, I 
went to our tent to stretch out for 
a moment, perhaps to catch a 
catnap. Worn out, I slept for 
hours. 

Kemper woke me. 

“Get up. Bob!” he said. “For 
the love of God, get up!” 

It was late afternoon and the 
last rays of the sun were stream- 
ing through the tent flap. Kem- 
per’s face was haggard. It was as 
if he’d suddenly grown old since 
I’d seen him less than twelve 
hours before. 

“They’re encysting,” he gasped. 
“They’re turning into cocoons or 
chrysalises or . .” 

I sat up quickly. “That one we 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



found out there in the field!” 

He nodded. 

“Fullerton?” I asked. 

“We’ll go out and see, all five 
of us, leaving the camp and ani- 
mals alone.” 

We had some trouble finding 
It because the land was so flat 
and featureless that there were 
no landmarks. 

But finally we located it, just 
as dusk was setting in. 

The ball had split in two — 
not in a clean break, in a jagged 
one. It looked like an egg after 
a chicken has been hatched. 

And the halves lay there in the 
j/.alhering darkness, in the silence 
imderneath the sudden glitter of 
(he stars — a last farewell and a 
new beginning and a terrible alien 
liui. 

I tried to say something, but 
my brain was so numb that I was 
not entirely sure just what I 
Mbould say. Anyhow, the words 
died in the dryness of my mouth 
and the thickness of my tongue 
before I could get them out. 

b'or it was not only the two 
halves of the coGoon — it was 
Ibe murks within that hollow, the 
impiession of what had been 
(here, blurred and distorted by 
I lie marks of what it had become. 

We fled back to camp. 

^OMEONE, I think it was Oli- 
‘ ver, got the lantern lighted. 

We stood uneasily, unable to 



look at one another, knowing that 
the time was past for all dissem- 
bling, that there was no use of 
glossing over or denying what 
we’d seen in the dim light in the 
gully. 

“Bob is the only one who has 
a chance,” Kemper finally said, 
speaking more concisely than 
seemed possible. “I think he 
should leave right now. Someone 
must get back to Caph. Someone 
has to tell them.” 

He looked across the circle of 
lantern light at me. 

“Well,” he said sharply, “get 
going! What’s the matter with 
you?” 

“You were right,” I said, not 
much more than whispering. “Re- 
member how you wondered 
about a defense mechanism?” 
“They have it,” Weber agreed. 
“The best you can find. There’s 
no beating them. They don’t fight 
you. They absorb you. They make 
you into them. No wonder there 
are just the critters here. No won- 
der the planet’s ecology is simple. 
They have you pegged and meas- 
ured from the instant you set 
foot on the planet. Take one 
drink of water. Chew a single 
grass stem. Take one bite of crit- 
ter. Do any one of these things 
and they have you cold.” 

Oliver came out of the dark 
and walked across- the lantern- 
lighted circle. He stopped in front 
of me.

“Here are your diet kit and 
notes,” he said. 

“But I can’t run out on you!” 

“Forget us!” Parsons barked at 
me. “We aren’t human any more. 
In a few more days . .” 

He grabbed the lantern and 
strode down the cages and held 
the lantern high, so that we could 
see. 

“Look,” he said. 

There were no animals. There 
were just the cocoons and the lit- 
tle critters and the cocoons that 
had split in half. 

I saw Kemper looking at me 
and there was, of all things, com- 
passion on his face. 

“You don’t want to stay,” he 
told me. “If you do, in a day or 
two, a critter will come in and 
drop dead for you. And you’ll go 
crazy all the way back home — 
wondering which one of us it 
was.” 

TTE TURNED away then. 

They all turned away from 
me and suddenly it seemed I was 
all alone. 

Weber had found an axe some- 
where and he started walking 
down the row of cages, knocking 
off the bars to let the little crit- 
ters out. 

I walked slowly over to the 
ship and stood at the foot of the 
ladder, holding the notes and the 
diet kit tight against my chest. 

When I got there, I turned 



around and looked back at them 
and it seemed I couldn’t leave 
them. 

I thought of all we’d been 
through together and when I 
tried to think of specific things, 
the only thing I could think about 
was how they always kidded me 
about the diet kit. 

And I thought of the times I 
had to leave and go off some- 
where and eat alone so that I 
couldn’t smell the food. I thought 
of almost ten years of eating that 
damn goo and that I could never 
eat like a normal human because 
of my ulcerated stomach. 

Maybe they were the lucky 
ones, I told myself. If a man got 
turned into a critter, he’d prob- 
ably come out with a whole stom- 
ach and never have to worry 
about how much or what he ate. 
The critters never ate anything 
except the grass, but maybe, I 
thought, that grass tasted just as 
good to them as a steak or a 
pumpkin pie would taste to me. 

So I stood there for a while 
and I thought about it. Then I 
took the diet kit and flung it out 
into the darkness as far as I could 
throw it and I dropped the notes 
to the ground. 

I walked back into the camp 
and the first man I saw was Par- 
sons. 

“What have you got for sup- 
per?” I asked him.

GYPPED 



By LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



I T ALL began ten years ago, 
when I was a sub-clerk in the 
Special Problems Section on 
Base VII. The Chief walked in 
one hot morning (all mornings 
are hot on Base VII) and tossed 
a letter at me. 

“Here’s a special problem to 
end all special problems,” he said. 

It was the expensively em- 
bossed stationery of the Galactic 
Commission, with an added fancy 
ornament that the Committee on 
Intercultural Relations had 
adopted. The Committee was re- 
questing of Base VII all available 



information concerning musical 
culture in its sector. 

“Let’s see,” I said. “There are 
the Golarifths on Willac. They 
rub their tentacles together dur- 
ing mating season. Humans can’t 
hear it, but it’s said to produce 
some pretty lively music. It that 
what they had in mind?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” said the 
Chief. 

“And the Arocambi on Mandus. 
Their noises faintly resemble 
the backfire of a commuter plane. 
How would that do?” 

“It’s your problem,” he said.

and he walked away laughing. 

As a problem, it didn’t amount 
to much. I’d had some really 
tough ones to handle. There was 
the time the Gistobs from Vernith 
were sending a trade commission 
to Earth. Base VII was requested 
to forward blueprints of a typical 
Gistob dwelling so a model com- 
munity could be built for them 
to use. As if any idiot didn’t 
know that no self-respecting Gis- 
tob would ever hang his hat any- 
where but in a nice, creamy mud- 
hole. 

Then there was the time the 
Hollywood millionaires decided 
to double their fortunes by palm- 
ing off their three-hundred-year- 
old films to the outlying planets. 
Some kind of primitive war pic- 
ture was shown on Lamruth and 
the natives were enthralled. They 
didn’t understand the picture, but 
they were captivated by the air 
raid sirens and they decided they 
wanted one. They bombarded 
Base VII with demands and 
threats until the thing was tossed 
into the lap of Special Problems. 

I got tired of the whole busi- 
ness after a year or so and I told 
Engineering to make them one. 
Engineering went overboard on 
the project, as Engineering usu- 
ally does. They delivered an 
amazing noisemaker that not only 
had a siren, but other gadgets 
that chirped and squeaked and 
honked and hissed. 



The thing was installed in the 
capital city of Lamruth and, ever 
since, the natives have gathered 
from miles around once a week 
to hear the thing cut loose. 

And then there was the prob- 
lem of the natives on Emruck. 

MRUCK developed into quite 
a tourist attraction because 
of its miniature active volcanoes 
and its moving rock formations. 
But the natives are humans and 
they positively refused to wear 
clothing. The Galactic Commis- 
sion was highly embarrassed by 
the situation and Special Prob- 
lems was put to work on it. It 
took some doing, but eventually 
we got the natives dressed. The 
Galactic Commission wasn’t 
happy about that, either. As soon 
as the natives started wearing 
clothing, the tourist trade prac- 
tically dropped to zero. 

And there was the time — but 
all this doesn’t have anything to 
do with my invention. 

The request for information 
on musical Culture didn’t faze me. 
In fact, I had a form letter for 
just such emergencies and I put 
it to work. 

“The musical culture of this 
sector,” I wrote, “is extremely 
complex and virtually impossible 
to describe. No data has been 
accumulated because no one at- 
tached to Base VII has the neces- 
sary specialized knowledge and 



GYPPED 



37 



equipment for such a project.” 

I sent the letter off and forgot 
about it. 

Some ten months later, the 
Chief walked in with a shriveled, 
bewiskered specimen I certainly 
would have taken for a Nincolm 
if he hadn’t been wearing clothing. 

“This,” said the Chief, “is Pro- 
fessor Wolfstammer.” 

“Professor Otto Wolfstammer,” 
the Professor said. 

“The Professor is a musicolo- 
gist,” said the Chief. 

“A comparative musicologist,” 
the Professor said. 

“He has been sent out by the 
Galactic Commission to study 
music in this sector,” said the 
Chief. 

“To study musical culture in 
this sector,” the Professor said. 

“Do you know what a compara- 
tive musicologist is?” asked the 
Chief. 

I’d had a hard morning and my 
reflexes were on the slow side. 
“No,” I confessed. 

“The Professor will be glad to 
tell you,” the Chief said, and he 
walked away laughing. 

The Professor was more than 
glad to tell me. He dragged in a 
few crates of apparatus and lec- 
tured to me for two hours. When 
he had finished, I still didn’t 
know what a comparative musi- 
cologist might be, but I had a 
very good idea about what should 
be done with the Professor. 



T he HIMARD supply ship 
was leaving that evening. I 
put the Professor and his equip- 
ment on board. He went quietly, 
if not eagerly, because I had 
given him a stirring description 
of the unusual vocal music to be 
found among the natives there. 

I want it understood that there 
was neither malice nor ignorance 
behind my sending him to Him- 
ard. 

Of course I knew that the 
natives on Himard were tone 
deaf. 

I thought that the Professor 
would discover that for himself 
in something under twenty-four 
hours. But even if he did, it would 
be a month before he could get 
back to Base VII and I needed 
that month to get over his lecture 
on comparative musicology. 

I overrated the Professor. He 
was gone for two months, and 
when he came back, he was a 
hospital case. He never did find 
out that the natives were tone 
deaf. But he bothered them so 
persistently and was so deter- 
mined to make them sing into 
his recording machine that they 
began to think he was ridiculing 
their musical inadequacy. 

People can be sensitive about 
a deficiency when an Earthling 
in long whiskers keeps making an 
issue of it. They nearly killed the 
Professor. 

I thought it might cost me my 



GYPPED 



39 



job, but he never filed a com- 
plaint. He still doesn’t know those 
natives were tone deaf. He thought 
they were just unusually belli- 
gerent. 

He came to see me the day he 
got out of the hospital. “I’m very 
sorry to bother you again,” he 
apologized. 

“Don’t mention it,” I said. “How 
did you enjoy the music on Him- 
ard?” 

“Wonderful! Really, it was 
marvelous. Most unusual, too. But 
I’m afraid it is not exactly suit- 
able for my purposes. I wonder 
if you would suggest — ” 

“Another planet?” 

“Yes, if you would be so kind. 
If possible, one where the inhabi- 
tants are a bit more peaceful.” 

I looked at the work piled on 
my desk and thought about the 
time it would take to go through 
the files looking for accidental 
references to music. I didn’t even 
know that there were any. I 
couldn’t recall ever having seen 
a single one. 

Then I had an inspiration. I 
remembered the siren I’d had 
built for the natives of Lamruth. 

“This might interest you,” I 
said. “On Lamruth, there is an 
open-air concert once a week. 
The music is produced by some 
mysterious instruments which are 
carefully guarded. The concerts 
are so popular that natives walk 
miles to hear them.” 

40 



^1'* HE Professor’s eyes sparkled. 

It may have been my ima- 
gination, but I think he drooled 
a little, too. 

“Amazing,” he said. “Such a 
level of musical development on 
these outlying planets has never 
been suspected.” 

“You’ll find the music unique,” 
I promised him. “But I’ll warn 
you about one thing — don’t at- 
tempt to see the musical instru- 
ments or ask questions about 
them. The natives might react 
violently.” 

“I shall proceed cautiously,” he 
said. He still wore some bandages 
from his Himard adventure. 

A week later, the Professor left 
for Lamruth. I never saw him 
again, but I heard some pretty 
funny reports about what he did 
there. 

He was astonished by the music 
of Lamruth. He observed, listened 
and recorded. He analyzed and 
synthesized. Then he returned to 
Earth and wrote a book, and the 
Galactic Commission, with Its 
usual disregard for the value of 
the taxpayers’ money, published 
it. 

I’ve never seen the book. Few 
people have, but I understand 
that it contains several hundred 
pages of fine print, many sheets 
of music, a long series of mathe- 
matical calculations concerning 
the Lamruth musical system, and 
photographs of the enraptured 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



natives listening to my synthetic 
air raid siren. It winds up with 
an essay on the sociological im- 
plications of music on Lamruth. 

What happened next is too 
fantastic to believe, but I’ll re- 
mind you that these events are 
documented in the Galactic Com- 
mission Scientific Studies, Series 
9847, Volume 432. 

A librarian in an obscure library 
on Mars noticed the pages of 
calculations in the Professor’s 
book and classified the book as 
mathematics. It collected dust in 
that section of the library for 
two years. Then a passing mathe- 
matician accidently knocked it off 
the shelf. He picked it up to see 
what had hit him and noticed 
those same mathematical calcula- 
tions. 

He took the book home and 
studied it and wrote a paper on 
a new mathematical basis for 
musical sounds. 

The paper was read by a scien- 
tist on Earth, who used it as the 
point of departure for a theore- 
tical study in the latent energy 
of sound waves. An engineer saw 
this study and published a specu- 
lation on the amount of unhar- 
nessed energy released hourly in 
the noise of the average large 
city. Other scientists and engi- 
neers became interested and even- 
tually they evolved the now fa- 
mous Fottengil Process, by which 
all major cities of Earth have 



free electrical power conveniently 
processed from their own noise. 

I T SOUNDS fantastic, but as 
I told you, it’s all documented. 
The Galactic Commission un- 
covered this strange series of 
events in a special investigation 
into the sources of the Fottengil 
Process. Lavish rewards were 
made to all who had contributed, 
including the librarian who mis- 
classified the Professor’s book. 

The Professor was given a 
generous pension for life, in spite 
of the fact that other musicolo- 
gists had proven his mathemati- 
cal calculations to be completely 
in error. Even the Chief was re- 
warded for the cooperation ex- 
tended to the Professor by his 
department. He was transferred 
back to Earth and given a soft 
job with double the salary. 

The one who started the entire 
development — namely myself — 
was all but forgotten. 

It was I who had that siren 
built in the first place. 

It was I who sent the Professor 
to Lamruth. 

And I’m now a sub-clerk in 
the Special Problems Section on 
Base XVI. 

It’s true that there is a sign 
on my desk that says “Cultural 
Adviser.” It is also true that I 
don’t have much work to do, be- 
cause not many people come here 
after cultural advice — only two

this year, so far. The last one was 
an art expert. I told him I’d heard 
of three-dimensional paintings on 
Calmus and got rid of him within 
twenty-four hours. He may not 
be back, because the natives on 
Calmus have no eyesight and they 
tend to be sensitive about that. 

My job is easy and the govern- 
ment service provides regular pay 
credits. But I’m stuck here on 



Base XVI, with no one for com- 
pany but haughty department 
heads and a lot of moronic sub- 
clerks, and the climate is terrible. 

I wouldn’t have you think I’m 
bitter about it, but I want to set 
the record straight. 

I ask you, is that any way to 
reward the person responsible for 
the Fottengil Process?

By WIllY lEY 



WELCOME TO REALITY, C-Tl 

S ORTING old correspon- 
dence, I just came across 
a typewritten page which 
was the beginning of a Galaxy 
column I had started and did not 
finish. 

I don’t recall any more why I 
changed my mind then, but be- 
cause of certain clues I know that 
it was written during the latter 
part of January, 1955. Here is 
what I wrote then: 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



43 




“If contra-terrene matter does 
not exist, Nature performed an 
elaborate hoax last year in order 
to make us believe that it does. 
Some time during 1954 — date 
undisclosed — a Skyhook balloon 
hovered for six hours at a height 
of a little more than 10,000 feet 
over Texas. It had been released 
from Goodfellow Air Force Base 
in Texas and was part of a joint 
research project of the Office of 
Naval Research and the Atomic 
Energy Commission, The equip- 
ment carried in the gondola was of 
the kind that detects and records 
cosmic rays. 

“When the ‘catch’ was ex- 
amined later by Professor Marcel 
Schein and his colleagues of the 
Department of Physics of the 
University of Chicago, they saw 
that they had indeed caught 
something unusual. Nothing like 
it had ever been seen before — 
it was a ‘pure photon shower.’ 
Twenty-one photons were counted 
in a very small space, with ener- 
gies from somewhat below 1000 
million electron volts to as much 
as 20,000 million electron volts. 

“The total energy release 
amounted to 10'" (or 10,000 
million million) electron volts. 
This in itself would be fantastic 
and new enough. But when the 
scientists looked for the heavy 
charged particles which one 
would expect as the cause of such 
a burst, there weren’t any.” 

44 



T his is as far as I got then. 

Now, only one year later, the 
whole thing is outdated. 

We no longer have to say that 
such a photon shower must have 
been caused by a particle of 
contra-terrene matter. (Dr. Zwic- 
ky had predicted in a letter pub- 
lished in vol. 48, 1935, of the 
Physical Review that such par- 
ticles could be found only at ex- 
treme altitudes.) We no longer 
have to quote this case as possible 
evidence for the probable ex- 
istence of contra-terrene matter. 

In fact, it does not matter if 
this particular case is never ex- 
plained down to the last photon. 
For in October, 1955, contra- 
terrene matter was made at the 
University of California. This 
matter being what it is, it is a 
good thing that they can make 
it only an atom at a time. 

Contra-terrene matter, despite 
apparent evidence to the con- 
trary, was not thought up by a 
science fiction writer. It appeared 
in print for the first time in 1934 
in a very technical work with the 
title Die moderne Atomtheorie 
(Modern Atomic Theory) which 
was a symposium published by 
Professor W. Heisenberg, a Nobel 
Prize winner. The chapter dis- 
cussing the possibility of “re- 
verse matter” was by another 
Nobel Prize winner. Dr. P. A. M. 
Dirac. 

Dirac reasoned thus : There 
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was a small particle carrying a 
negative charge, the electron. Its 
opposite number was the proton, 
carrying a positive charge, but 
more than 1800 times as massive 
as the electron. Then there was 
the neutron, about as massive as 
the proton, but without any 
electrical charge. 

Dirac concluded that there 
should be another set of atomic 
particles, namely the “anti-elec- 
tron” and the “anti-proton.” The 
anti-electron should have the 
same mass as an electron, but 
carrying a positive charge. The 
anti-proton, of course, would have 
the mass of the proton, but with 
a negative charge. 

VERY ordinary atom that 
we know consists of a 
nucleus of protons and neutrons, 
surrounded by a number of elec- 
trons arranged in several layers, 
called shells. If Dirac’s two un- 
known particles existed, there 
should be a matter of an entirely 
different type, with negatively 
charged anti-protons in the nu- 
cleus and surrounded by anti- 
electrons. 

Theoretically you could have a 
counterpart of every element 
built up in this matter. To the 
eye, there would be no difference 
between ordinary (or “terrene”) 
iron and such contra-terrene iron. 
Most likely it would have the 
same melting point. The spectro- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



scope could not tell them apart. 
But if the twain should meet, 
they would utterly annihilate 
each other with nothing left but 
pure energy. Of course iron did 
not have to meet iron; contra- 
terrene iron meeting terrene air 
would produce the same effect. 

Dirac’s “anti-electron” was act- 
ually discovered some time later 
and became known as a positron. 

It remained to find the anti- 
proton, tentatively called “nega- 
tron.” But that was not easy. 
Even if such matter existed else- 
where in space, it could not pene- 
trate the atmosphere. It would 
make only a very bright flash at 
very high altitudes and such a 
bright flash would not be much 
of a proof. 

V. Rojansky calculated in 
1940 that a contra-terrene iron 
meteorite, if it was to reach the 
surface, would have to be 16 
inches in diameter and 60 inches 
in length. Even then it had to 
fall without tumbling or else it 
would be consumed completely 
while still falling. 

There were a few cases on 
record that looked suspicious in 
the light of this theory, the best 
known being the great Siberian 
meteorite of 1908. But since, by 
definition, no meteoritic matter 
could be left, there could never 
be any palpable evidence. And as 
the years wore on, several scien- 
tists tried to find reasons why the 

45 



anti-proton was “unnecessary” 
and “therefore” probably did not 
exist. 

Well, anti-protons have now 
been produced in the laboratory. 
Naturally they lasted for only a 
tiny fraction of a second with all 
that inimical terrene matter 
around. But they could be ob- 
served. They were there and — 
surprise! — their so-called cross 
section turned out to be about 
double of that of the proton. 
Maybe the spectroscope will still 
be useful; nobody can tell at the 
moment. But knowing now what 
to go after, we’ll know soon. 

SQUARE AND CIRCLE 

'T’HE year was 1775 A.D. The 
most important scientific 
body then in existence — over- 
shadowing even the Royal So- 
ciety of London to all but Eng- 
lishmen — namely the Academy 
of Sciences in Paris, announced 
a resolution which said that the 
Academy would no longer in- 
vestigate or examine alleged 
solutions of the problem of squar- 
ing the circle which might be sub- 
mitted. The same went for the 
so-called Delian problem of 
doubling a cube or for the tri- 
section of angles. 

Dissemination of news was not 
what it is now in 1775. Many 
people outside of Paris engaged 
in these three problems apparent- 

46 



ly did not learn that the Academy 
had declared them, by implica- 
tion, to be insoluble. Papers and 
pamphlets continued to come in. 
But one has the feeling that, even 
if the authors of these papers had 
learned about the Academy’s atti- 
tude, they would not have been 
discouraged, for that is something 
you cannot do to a true circle 
squarer. 

As regards the other two prob- 
lems, the number of people 
addicted to them sqems to have 
been smaller at any time in his- 
tory. Speaking of the present, I 
can only say that I have never 
met anybody who spent his eve- 
nings trying to double a cube. I 
did meet three . or four tri-sectors, 
but I have come across at least 
half a dozen circle squarers. It 
is this particular problem which 
seems to have held, and still 
holds, a fascination that simply 
cannot be understood by the non- 
addict. 

Interestingly enough, the cir- 
cle squarers of the more recent 
past — say the last hundred years 

— always invented a so-called 
“good-reason” for their endeavors. 
They thought and said that the 
squaring of the circle would also 
reveal the Secret of the Universe 

— why and how, in the name of 
Pythagoras, and which secret did 
they mean? — or else they were 
convinced that somebody, some- 
where, had substantial sums of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



money waiting to be awarded as 
a prize to the successful genius. 

While there have been money 
prizes for various mathematical 
problems at one time or another, 
it so happens that there never was 
one for that particular problem — 
except in the sense that at least 
two people offered prizes for find- 
ing a mistake in their solutions. 
One of these two offered a thou- 
sand dollars (at a time when 
four dollars was a good week’s 
pay) and the other offered fifty 
pieces of gold. Both had to pay 
within a few years after offering 
the rewards. 

But I once knew a circle squar- 
er who confided to me that the 
Government had a secret prize 
in readiness. "That a secret prize 
is a plain absurdity just never 
occurred to him. Incidentally, he 
did not claim to have found the 
solution. 

TJ^ELL, to go into the story 
” itself, let’s look at the prob- 
lem first. The problem is to con- 
struct a square of precisely the 
same area as a given circle. Em- 
phasis is on the word precisely; 
a difference of a mere one-tenth 
of one per cent or even of a ten- 
millionth of one per cent is not 
acceptable. It has to be precise. 
Along with this demand there 
goes a condition. The condition 
of that square has to be accom- 
plished by using only two tools: 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



a pair of compasses and an un- 
marked straight edge. If that 
classical condition is neglected, 
a solution can be found. Leonar- 
do da Vinci is the author of what 
is probably the earliest one. 

To construct a square of the 
same area as a given circle, da 
Vinci made a roller of the same 
diameter as the circle. The thick- 
ness of the roller was one-half of 
the radius of that circle — one- 
quarter of its diameter. Running 
the inked roller on a sheet of 
paper for precisely one revolution 
resulted in a rather long and 
narrow rectangle of the same area 
as the circle. To convert the rec- 
tangle into a square by geometri- 
cal construction was elementary. 
With instruments in addition to 
the pair of compasses and the 
unmarked ruler, it can be done. 

But when you do observe the 
classical condition, things have a- 
habit of getting tough very fast 
— and of staying that way. One 
way tried by many is shown in 
Fig. 1. There you have the circle. 
You put one square inside it and 
another one around it; obviously 
the inscribed square is smaller in 
area than the circle, while the 
circumscribed square is larger. 
The wanted square is evidently 
intermediate in size. To construct 
it, we halve the distance between 
the two squares and draw a third 
one (dotted line in Fig. 1). It 
looks as if it might be of the 

47 




right size. 

To prove that it is, you have 
to prove that the protruding seg- 
ment of the circle and the pro- 
truding corner of the square are 
equal in area — to make this 
more easily visible, one of each 
has been shaded in the drawing. 
Well, in this particular case, the 
two areas are not equal, as one 
can easily see. But if you had a 
square of a slightly larger size 
where the two areas look equal, 
you could not prove their equality 
by any means, even if it happens 
to be the case of sheer accident. 

J UMPING somewhat ahead of 
the actual historical develop- 
ment, one may ask whether there 
was a reason why so many peo- 
ple through so many centuries 
believed that it could be done. 
There was. There was a case 
where it could be proved that a 

48 



figure bounded by pieces of cir- 
cles was precisely equal in area 
to another figure bounded by 
straight lines. 

This case is known to mathe- 
maticians as the menisci or lunu- 
lae of Hippocrates of Chios, who 
lived in Athens during the second 
half of the fifth century b.c. It 
may be wrong to say that he 
caused the waste of more man- 
hours than anybody since his 
time, but he certainly ranks high 
among inventors of misleading 
evidence. 

Look at Fig. 2. You have there 
a triangle in which one angle is 
a right angle and both cathetes 
and the hypotenuse are adorned 
with a half circle each. The half 
circle A has, of course, the largest 
area, while the areas of E and D 
are smaller. None of them has an 
area which is either equal to or 
a simple fraction of the area T of 
the triangle. But E h D A; the 
two smaller semicircles taken 
together have the same area as 
the larger one. 

Now we redraw the same thing 
as shown in Fig. 2B. The largest 
of the three semicircles then 
splits each of the smaller ones 
into two unequal areas. The 
former area E now consists of 
e -h e' and the former area D 
now consists of the areas d -f- d’. 
The largest semicircle obviously 
is the sum of T -I- e' -4- d’. Since 
e + e' d + d' are equal to T 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





+ e' + d’, the area T must be 
equal to e + d. In words : the area 
of the two lunulae equals the 
area of the triangle. If this does 
not look like a possible approach 
to converting a circle into a 
square, nothing does. 

The similarity can easily be car- 
ried a step farther by drawing the 
figure 3. The square inscribed in 
a circle demonstrably consists of 
four triangles; all you have to do 
is to connect the four corners by 
two lines which are also diameters 
of the circle. Then you construct 
the four lunulae. And there can 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



be no doubt that A = a, B = b, 
C = c and D = d. Of course A 
will equal d etc. etc. And A + B 
+ C +D equals the square. 

All you have to do now is to 
convert the four lunulae into 
one circle and the problem is 
solved. But if you try to do that, 
you’ll find out, after an hour or 
after three years, depending on 
your individual persistence, that 
it cannot be done. 

The lunulae of Hippocrates are 
an interesting and very special 




case which only happens to look 
as if it bore any relationship to 
the problem. 



T)UT the whole thing, count- 
less people have moaned 
through the centuries, looks so 
simple on principle! You can 
prove that a certain triangle must 

49 



have the same area as a given 
circle. The height of that triangle 
must be equal to the radius of 
the circle and its base must be 
equal to its circumference. It re- 
mains to construct such a triangle. 
The height presents no problem, 
of course, but just what is the 
length of the base? 

This problem has a separate 
name. It is called the rectifica- 
tion of the circle, but actually 
rectification and quadrature go 
hand in hand. If one could solve 
the one, the other would be solved 
automatically. 

Well, the circumference of the 
circle is its diameter multiplied 
by something, namely the ratio 
of diameter to circumference. 
Everybody knows now that this 
ratio is called by the Greek letter 
pi, and since the problem came 
down to us from the Greeks, one 
has the tendency to assume that 
it was “always” called by that 
letter. 

Actually the use of pi to desig- 
nate this value is rather recent. 
It was used that way for the first 
time by the Englishman William 
Jones in 1706 in a book with the 
title Synopsis palmariorum Ma- 
thesos, which was an introduction 
to mathematics. Mr. Jones’ usage 
was then popularized by Leon- 
hard Euler in his voluminous 
correspondence as well as in his 
main work, the Introductio in 
analysin infinitorum which ap- 

50 



peared in 1748. 

The wrestling with this value 
goes back past the Greeks for 
good and practical reasons. The 
oldest figure we have is that given 
in the Papyrus Rhind. The copy 
of the papyrus we have is not the 
original; it says in the manuscript 
itself that it was copied by clerk 
Ahmes, the servant of the king 
Raaus, which dates the copy as 
having been made in about 1700 
B.C. The papyrus states that the 
area of a circle is equal to a 
square constructed with the base 
of 8/9th of the diameter. In deci- 
mal notation, this makes pi equal 
to 3.1604, which is better than 
the figure given in the Bible (1 
Kings, vii, 23 and 2 Chronicles 
iv, 2 if you want to check) where 
the value of pi appears as a 
straight three. 

Among the Greeks, the first to 
come up with a value was Archi- 
medes, who stated that the figure 
was greater than 3 10/71 but 
smaller than 3 10/70. Compared 
to the modern value, these figures 
look as follows: 

3 10/71 = 3.14084 

pi = 3.14159 . 

3 1/7 = 3.14285 

This is really good enough for 
most practical purposes and the 
value of 3 1/7 was used for many 
centuries for such things as meas- 
uring the iron rirn for a wheel or 
cutting paving blocks for a cir- 
cular enclosure of some kind. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



R oman surveyors know Arc- 
himedes’ approximation of 
3 1/7, but are said to have used 
3 1/8 in their work since it made 
calculations that much easier! 

Of the Chinese, we know what 
values were used by some of 
their mathematicians, but we do 
not know how they arrived at 
them. 

One Wang Fau used the ratio 
142/45, which is 3.1555, while 
Chang King thought that pi was 
equal to the square root of 10, 
which is 3.1622777, an accidental 
similarity that has troubled many 
later circle squarers. (Another 
such similarity has caused many 
geometrical constructions, namely 
the fact that the square root of 
2 plus the square root of 3 closely 
resembles pi. The figures are 
1.4142136 + 1.7320508 = 

3.1462644.) The best Chinese ap- 
proximation was that of the 
astronomer T s u Ch’ung-chih 
(born in 430 A.D.) who arrived 
at the ratio of 355/113 or 
3.1415929. 

Of the men of the Renaissance 
who tried their hand on the recti- 
fication of the circle. I’ll mention 
only Nikolaus Chrypffs, who was 
born at Kues on the Moselle in 
1401 and became known later in 
life as Cardinal Nicolaus Cusanus. 
His construction is shown in Fig. 
4. If the smaller circle to the left 
is the given circle, you construct 
one side of the inscribed square 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



AB and use this to establish point 
C. Then you draw a circle the 
center of which is halfway be- 
tween point C and the center of 
the first circle. The triangle in- 
scribed in this second and some- 
what larger circle has the same 
circumference as the first circle. 
Or rather it would have if pi were 
equal to 3.1361. 

A much better, slightly more 
accurate and at any event faster 
approximation is the one shown 
in Fig 5. The construction is 
obvious from the drawing. The 
line ABC, when multiplied by 
two, is a fraction of a per cent 
longer than the circumference of 
the circle. 

The construction shown in Fig. 
6 is even more elegant. It was 
found in 1685 by Adam Kokhan- 
sky, the Royal Mathematician of 
the King of Poland. 

The construction begins with 




the circle, a tangent and a dia- 
meter which touches the peri- 

51 



phery in the same point as the 
tangent. Then you construct an 
angle of 30°, which establishes 
point A on the tangent. Then you 
proceed along the tangent for 3 
radii, which establishes point B, 



B 









Vc 



AB»Vf R 

f'9- 5 bc»V3r 



The line from B to C represents 
half the periphery of the circle. 
It does so with surprising accur- 
acy, for it would be correct if pi 
were 3.141533. 

Actually, pi is a so-called trans- 
cendental number which cannot 
be expressed accurately either by 
decimals or as a fraction. Since 
this cannot be done, it cannot be 
constructed. You can produce al- 
most any degree of accuracy you 
wish, but it cannot really be ac- 

52 



curate — provided, to repeat, that 
you stick to compass and un- 
marked straight edge as the in- 
struments employed. 

B ut though most people know 
by now that a fully accu- 
rate construction is impossible, 
every once in a while somebody 
succeeds in coming up with a new 
approximation that has been 
missed in the past. In 1910, a 
German civil servant, Peter Pu- 
povac, submitted to a mathema- 
tician the construction shown in 
Fig. 7. You divide the diameter of 
the circle into five parts, add one 
more and draw a vertical line in 
that point. You make it three di- 
vions high. The sum of the three 
sides of this triangle nearly equals 
the circumference of the circle, 
namely 6/5 + 3/5 + 3/10 mul- 
tiplied by the square root of five. 
This amounts to 3.14164, so the 
sum of the sides of the triangle is 
0.00005 diameters too large. 

Another surprising approxima- 
tion — this time a direct quadra- 
ture rather than a rectification^ — - 
was found accidentally by a Ger- 
man officer in World War I. Dur- 
ing a period of quiet in spring- 
time, when the lilacs were in 
bloom, he amused himself by 
trying to draw a representation of 
a lilac blossom with nothing but 
a pair of compasses. When he had 
obtained a result which he con- 
sidered a good representation, he 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Fig. 6 




noticed that a circle and a square 
overlapped. (Fig. 2) They looked 
as if they were equal in area. 

After the war, he sent the figure 
to a mathematician, Dr. Theodor 
Wolff, with the question whether 
Nature might not have accom- 
plished something that Man had 
failed to do. Dr. Wolff had a ready 
answer, namely that Nature, if she 
had found a solution, had done so 
in violation of the classical rule, 




something which Man could do, 
too. Then he calculated what mis- 
take, if any, Nature had made. 

Nature had not solved the prob- 
lem even by using non-classical 
methods. The difference between 
the areas of the circle and the 
square is a little less than one 
per cent of the circle’s area. 

The savants of the French 
Academy who decided not to 
waste their time any more by ex- 
amining so-called solutions of the 
circle-square problem would have 
liked this little touch. Even 
Mother Nature can’t do it cor- 
rectly!

Everything about the aliens

T hey had strapped the En- 
emy to a chair, which in 
John Jahnke’s opinion was 
neither necessary nor smart, but 
Jahnke was only a captain (Field 
rank). Ugly the squat, gray- 
furred, sharp-toothed creatures 
were, certainly, and their thick 
bodies, well over six feet tall, 
were frighteningly strong. But 
they were also proud and intelli- 
gent. They never ran amok in a 
hopeless situation; that would be 
beneath their dignity. 

The irons were going to make

have been otherwise — and that 
would have been difficult enough. 
But Jahnke was only a Field offi- 
cer and, what was worse, invalid- 
ed Home. Here it could hardly 
matter that he knew the Enemy 
better than any other human be- 
ing alive. His opinions would be 
weighed against the fact that he 
had been invalided Home from a 
Field where there were no battles. 
And the two years of captivity? A 
rest cure, the Home officers called 
them. 

“Where did you take him?” he 
asked Major Matthews. 

“Off a planet of 3 1 Cygni,” Mat-

thews growled, loosening his tie. 
“Whopping sun, a hundred fifty 
times as big as Sol, six hundred 
fifty light-years from here. All 
alone there in a ship no bigger 
than himself.” 

“A scout?” 

“What else? All right, he’s 
ready.” Matthews looked at the 
two hard-faced enlisted men be- 
hind the Enemy’s chair. One of 
them grinned slightly. “Ask him 
where he’s from.” 

The gray creature turned flat 
steady eyes on Jahnke, obviously 
already aware that he was the 
interpreter. Sweating, Jahnke put 
the question. 

“Hnimesacpeo,” the Enemy 
said. 

“So far, so good,” Jahnke mur- 
mured hopefully. “Hnimesacpeo 
tee rebo?” 

“Tea." 

“Well?” Matthews demanded. 

“That’s the big province in the 
northern hemisphere of Vega III. 
Thus far, he’s willing to be rea- 
sonable.” 

“The hell with that. We al- 
ready knew he was Vegan. 
Where’s his station?” 

W HETHER or not the Enemy 
was Vegan was unknown 
and might never be known. But 
there was no point in arguing 
that with Matthews; he already 
thought he knew. After a mo- 
ment’s struggle with the language. 



Jahnke tried: “Sftir etminbi 

Tokolny?” 

“R-daee blk." 

“Either he doesn’t understand 
me,” Jahnke said resignedly, “or 
he won’t talk while he’s in the 
chair. He says, ‘I just told you.’ ” 

“Try again.” 

“Dir at y edie,” Jahnke said. 
“St fir etminbu rakolna?” 

“Hnimesacpeo.” The creature’s 
eyes blinked once. “Ta hter o 
alkbee.” 

“It’s no good,” Jahnke said. 
“He’s giving me the same answer, 
but this time in the pejorative 
form — the one they use for 
draft animals and children. It 
might go better if you’d let him 
out of those irons.” 

Matthews laughed shortly. 
“Tell him* to open up or expect 
trouble. The irons are only the 
beginning.” 

“Sir, if you insist upon this 
course of action, I will appeal 
against it. It won’t work and it’s 
counter to policy. We know from 
long experience Outside that — ” 

“Never mind about Outside; 
you’re on Earth now,” Matthews 
r etorted harshly. “Tell him what 
I said.” 

Worse and worse. Jahnke put 
the message as gently as he could. 

The Enemy blinked. “Sehe et 
broe in ieen.” 

“Well?” Matthews snapped. 

“He says you couldn’t run a 
maze with your shoes off,” Jahnke 



WRITING OF THE RAT

said, with grim relish. The phrase 
was the mortal insult, but Mat- 
thews wouldn’t know that; the 
literal translation could mean lit- 
tle to him. 

Nevertheless, Matthews had 
brains enough to know when he 
was being defied. He flushed fu- 
riously. “All right!” he told the 
toughs. “Start on him — and don’t 
start slow!” 

Jahnke was abruptly wishing 
that he hadn’t translated the in- 
sult at all, but the outcome would 
probably have been the same in 
the long run. “Sir,” he said, his 
voice ragged, “I request your per- 
mission to leave.” 

“Don’t be stupid. Do you think 
we’re doing this for fun?” Since 
this what exactly what Jahnke 
thought, he was glad that the 
question was rhetorical. “Who’ll 
translate when he does talk, if 
you’re not here?” 

“He won’t talk.” 

“Yes, he will,” Matthews prom- 
ised savagely. “And you can tell 
him why.” 

After a moment, Jahnke said 
stonily; “Ocro hli antsoutinys, 
iuso tizen et tobee.” 

T T WAS a complex message 
and Jahnke w'as none too sure 
that he had got it right. The En- 
emy merely nodded once and 
looked away. There was no way 
of telling whether he had failed 
to understand, had understood 

56 



and was trying to avoid betray- 
ing Jahnke, or was merely indif- 
ferent. He said: “Seace tcectisbe.” 
The phrase was formal; it might 
mean “thank you,” but then again 
it might mean half 'a hundred 
equally common expressions, in- 
cluding “hello,” “good-by,” and 
“time for lunch.” 

“Does he understand?” Mat- 
thews demanded. 

“I think he does,” Jahnke said. 
“You’ll be destroying him for 
nothing. Major.” 

Two hours later, the gray crea- 
ture looked at Matthews' out of 
his remaining, lidless eye, said 
clearly, “Sehe et broe in icen,” 
and died. He had said nothing 
else, though he had cried out 
often. 

Somehow, that possible word 
of thanks he had given Jahnke 
made it worse, not better. 

Jahnke went back to his quar- 
ters on shaky legs, to compose a 
letter of protest. He gave it up 
after the first paragraph. There 
was nobody to write to. While he 
had been Outside, he could have 
appealed to the Chief of Intelli- 
gence Operations (Field), who 
had been his friend as well as his 
immediate superior. But now he 
was in New Washington, where 
the CIO(F) in his remote flag- 
ship swung less weight than 
Home officers as far down the 
chain of command as Major Mat- 
thews. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It hadn’t always been like that. 
After the discovery of the Enemy, 
the Field officers had commanded 
as much instant respect at Home 
as Field officers always had; they 
were in the position of danger. 
But as it gradually became clear 
that there was going to be no war, 
that the Field officers were bring- 
ing home puzzles instead of vic- 
tories, that the danger Outside 
was that of precipitating a battle 
rather than fighting one, the pen- 
dulum swung. Now Field officers 
treated the Enemy with respect 
and were despised for it — while 
the Home officers itched for the 
chance to show that they weren’t 
soft on the Enemy. 

Matthews had had one chance 
and would be itching for another. 

Jahnke put* down his pen and 
stared at the wall, feeling more 
than a little sick. 

^ I^HE gray creatures were, as 
it had turned out, every- 
where. When the first interstellar 
ship had arrived in the Alpha 
Centauri system, there they were, 
running the two fertile planets 
from vast stony cities by means 
of an elaborate priesthood. The 
relatively infertile fourth planet 
they had organized as a tight au- 
tarchy of technicians, dominat- 
ing a high-energy economy of 
scarcity. They had garrisoned 
several other utterly barren Cen- 
taurian planets, for what was 



vaguely called “reasons of pol- 
icy,” meaning that nobody knew 
why they had. 

That had been only a fore- 
taste. No habitable planet was 
without them, however far you 
stretched the definition of “habit- 
able.” Their most magnificent 
achievement was Vega III, an 
Earthlike world twice the diame- 
ter of Earth and at least a century 
in advance of Earth technologies. 
But they were found, too, on the 
major satellite of 61 Cygni C, a 
“gray ghost” star almost small 
enough to be a gas-giant planet, 
where they lived tribal lives as 
cramped and penurious as those 
of ancient Lapland — and had the 
Ragnarok-like mythology to go 
with it. 

No one could even guess how 
long they had known interstellar 
flight or where they had come 
from. The hypothesis that they 
had originally been Vegans was 
shaky, based solely on the fact 
that Vega III was their most 
highly developed planet yet dis- 
covered. As for facts that argued 
in the opposite direction, there 
were more than enough, from 
Jahnke’s point of view. 

They had, for instance, a com- 
mon spoken language, but every 
one of their civilizations had a 
different written language, usu- 
ally irreconcilable with all the 
others — pictograms, phonetic 
systems, ideograms, hieratic short- 



WRITING OF THE RAT 



57 




58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hands, inflectional systems, tone- 
modulated systems, positional 
systems — the works. The spoken 
language was so complex that not 
even Jahnke could speak it above 
primer level, for it was based on 
phoneme placement inside the 
word. In short, it was totally syn- 
thetic, derived from the Enemy’s 
vast knowledge of information 
theory, and could be matched up 
in part to any written language 
imaginable. 

Thus there was no way to tell 
what written language — which 
always abstracts from speech and 
introduces new elements that 
have nothing to do with speech 
— might have been the original. 

A nd how can you be sure you 
know where the Enemy’s 
home planet is, Jahnke brooded, 
when you can see him still ac- 
tively exploring and taking over 
one new system after another, for 
no other visible reason than sheer 
acquisitiveness? How can you tell 
how long that process has been 
going on, when no new penetra- 
tion of human beings to more dis- 
tant reaches of the Galaxy fails 
to find the gray creatures estab- 
lished on two or three promising 
planets, and nosing in on half a 
dozen additional cinder-blocks 
which have nothing to recom- 
mend them but the fact that they 
are large enough to land upon? 
“They’re nothing but six-foot- 



tall rats,” Col. Singh, the CIO(F), 
had once told Jahnke, in a tone 
of disgust unusual for him. “The 
whole damned Galaxy must be 
overrun with them. They couldn’t 
have evolved any civilization we 
ever found them in.” 

“They’re intelligent,” Jahnke 
had protested. “Nobody’s yet 
measured how intelligent they 
are.” 

“Sure,” Singh had said. “I’ll 
give them that much credit. 
They’re more than intelligent — 
they’re brilliant. Nevertheless 
they didn’t evolve any of ‘their’ 
civilizations, John. They couldn’t 
have, because the civilizations 
are too diversified. The Enemy 
maintains all of them with equal 
thoroughness and equal indiffer- 
ence. If we could just explore 
some of those planets. I’ll bet 
we’d find the bones of the origi- 
nal owners. How does that poem 
of Pound’s go?” 

His brow furrowed a moment 
over this apparent irrelevancy 
and he quoted: 

“And the wind shifts 
and the dust on a doorsill shifts 
and even the writing of the rat 
footprints 

tells us nothing, nothing at all 
about the greatest city, the 
greatest nation 

where the strong men listened 
and the women warbled: 
Nothing like us ever was. 
“That’s how it is,” Singh added 



WRITING OF THE RAT 



59 



gloomily. “All these gray rats are 
doing is picking everybody else’s 
cupboards. They’re very good at 
that. They may well be picking 
ours before long.” 

That was the second theory; on 
the whole, it was the most popu- 
lar one now. It was the theory un- 
der which a man like Matthews 
could torture to death a creature 
several times as intelligent as he 
was and with a code of customs 
and a set of moral standards which 
made Matthews look like a bush- 
man, on the grounds that the En- 
emy were merely loathsome 
scavengers, fit only for extermi- 
nation. 

TTkESPITE his respect for Piara 
Singh, Jahnke could find 
little good to say for the rat the- 
ory, either. Both theories pointed, 
in the end, toward a common mili- 
tary goal — that of finding the 
Enemy’s home planet and de- 
stroying it. If Vega III was the 
Enemy’s home, then at least there 
was a target. If the Enemy were 
spreading from some other heart- 
land, then the target still remained 
to be found. 

But what good was that? It was 
military nonsense. The Enemy 
outnumbered humanity by mil- 
lions to one. On the highly devel- 
oped planets like Vega III, the 
Enemy commanded weapons 
compared to which humanity’s 
best were only torches to be 

60 



waved in the face of the inevitable 
night. The first moment of open 
warfare would be the end of hu- 
manity. 

So far, the gray creatures and 
humanity were not at war. But 
the time of the explosion was 
drawing closer. Jahnke did not 
really think that the Enemy could 
be still in ignorance of Earth’s 
practice of picking up its lone 
scouts for questioning; the En- 
emy’s resources were too great. 

It was his private theory, 
shared by Piara Singh, that the 
Enemy was content to let its 
scouts be questioned, as long as 
they were set free unharmed 
later. After all, the Enemy had 
once picked up Jahnke under the 
same circumstances and for that 
same purpose. It was for that 
reason that he knew their lan- 
guage better than any other hu- 
man being; he had lived among 
them for two years. 

But if Matthew’s Inquisition 
methods represented a new and 
general policy toward these oc- 
casional captives, the Enemy 
would not let that policy go un- 
protested. The gray creatures 
were very proud. Jahnke knew 
that, for they had expected no 
less pride of him. 

And what would happen when 
one of the Enemy’s scouts came 
nosing, at long last, into the Solar 
System of Earth — even around 
so cold, dark and useless a world 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as the satellite of Proserpine, far 
beyond Pluto? Earth had no use 
for that rockball, but it would 
never let the “rats” have it, just 
the same. The gray tide had 
spared the Sol system, but that 
couldn’t last forever. It had 
spared nothing else. 

The phone rang insistently, 
jarring Jahnke out of his bitter 
reverie. He picked it up. 

“Captain Jahnke? One moment, 
please. Colonel Singh calling.” 

J AHNKE clung to the phone in 
a state of numb shock, uncer- 
tain whether to be delighted or 
appalled. What could Piara Singh 
be doing here, out of the high 
free emptiness of Outside? Had 
he been invalided Home again, 
too, or had some failure — 

“John? How are you? This is 
Singh; I called the moment I got 
in.” 

“Hello, Colonel. I’m astonished 
and pleased. But what — ” 

“I know what you’re thinking,” 
the CIO(F) said' rapidly. His 
voice was high with suppressed 
eagerness; Jahnke had never 
heard him sound so young before. 
“I’m Home on my own initiative, 
on special orders I wormed out 
of old Wu himself. I brought a 
prisoner with me. John, listen, he’s 
the most important prisoner we’ve 
ever taken. He told me his name!" 

“No! They never do! It’s against 
the rules!” 



“But he did,” Singh said, almost 
bubbling. “It’s Hrestce. In the lan- 
guage, it means ‘compromise,’ 
isn’t that right? I think he was 
deliberately sent to us with a mes- 
sage. That’s why I came Home. 
The key to the whole problem 
seems to be in his hands and he 
obviously wants to talk. I have 
to have you to listen to him and 
tell me what it means.” 

Jahnke’s heart tried to rise and 
sink at the same time, enclosing 
his whole chest in an awful vise 
of apprehension. “All right,” he 
said faintly. “Did you notify CIO? 
Here in New Washington, I 
mean?” 

“Oh, of course.” Singh’s enthu- 
siasm seemed to be about to burst 
the telephone handset — and 
small wonder, after all the set- 
backs that had made up his ca- 
reer Outside. “They recognized 
right away how important this 
is. They’ve assigned their best 
interrogation man to me, a Major 
Matthews. I don’t doubt that he’s 
good, but we’ll need you first. If 
you can get here for a preliminary 
talk with Hrestce — ” 

“I can get there,” Jahnke said 
tensely. “But don’t let anyone else 
talk to him before I do. This Mat- 
thews is dangerous; if he phones 
before I arrive, stall him. Where 
are you calling from?” 

“At home on the Kattegat. I 
have three weeks’ leave. You 
know the place, don’t you? You

can reach it in an hour, if you 
can catch a rocket immediately. 
I can keep Hrestce in my jurisdic- 
tion for you that long easily. No- 
body but you and the CIO knows 
he’s here.” 

“Don’t even let CIO at him un- 
til I get there. I’ll see you in an 
hour.” 

“Right, John. Good-by.” 

“Seace tee ctisbe.” 

“Yes — how does it go? Tea.” 
“Tee; tea.” 

T rembling with excitement 
and urgency, Jahnke got the 
rest of his mussed uniform off, 
clambered into mufti and packed 
his equipment: a tape recorder, 
two dictionaries compiled by him- 
self, a set of frequency tables for 
the Enemy language which he had 
not yet completed, and a tooth- 
brush. At the last moment, he re- 
membered to take his officer’s ID 
card and money to buy his rocket 
ticket. Now. All ready. 

He opened the door to go out. 
Matthews was there. His feet 
were wide apart, his hands locked 
behind his back, his face thrust 
forward. He looked like a lower- 
ing, small-scale copy of the Colos- 
sus of Rhodes. 

“Morning, Captain Jahnke,” 
Matthews said, with a slight and 
nasty smile. “Going somewhere? 
The Kattegat, maybe?” 

The soldiers behind Matthews, 
those same two wooden-faced 

62 



toughs, helped him wait for 
Jahnke’s answer. 

After a moment of sickening 
doubt, Jahnke retreated into his 
quarters, to the kitchen, out of 
Matthew’s sight. He found the 
bottle of cloudy ammonia his bat- 
man used for scrubbing his floors 
and shook it until it was full of 
foam. Then he went back to the 
front room and threw the bottle 
as hard as he could into the cor- 
ridor. It seemed to explode like 
a bomb. 

He had to knee one soldier who 
clawed through the fumes into 
the front room; he got away over 
the man’s writhing body. His eyes 
were streaming. Now he had to 
reach Singh before Matthews did. 

It would be a near thing. Tem- 
porarily, at least, time was on his 
side, Jahnke was pretty sure. 
Piara Singh’s Kattegat home was 
a retreat, quite possibly unlisted 
among the addresses the govern- 
ment had for him; Jahnke had 
learned of it only through a few 
moments of nostalgia in which 
the colonel had indulged over a 
drink. If so, Matthews would have 
a difficult time searching the 
shores of the strait for it, and 
might think only very belatedly 
of looking in the wildest part of 
Jutland. 

Also in Jahnke’s favor was the 
fact that Matthews was only a 
major. The man whose leave he 
had to plan on invading was a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



full colonel, even though only a 
despised Field officer — and the 
scorn in which Field officers were 
held was in itself only a symptom 
of the Home officers’ guilt at be- 
ing Home officers. Matthews 
would probably pause to collect 
considerable official backing be- 
fore venturing further. 

All this was logical, but Jahnke 
knew Matthews too well to be 
comforted by it. 

He got a liner direct to Copen- 
hagen, which cut down his transit 
time considerably. After that, 
there was only the complicated 
business of getting off the islands 
onto the peninsula, and thence 
north to Alborg. Col. Singh had 
a car waiting for him there, which 
took him direct to the lodge. 

“An hour and a half,” Singh 
said, shaking hands. “That was 
good time.” 

“Glad to see you, sir. We’re 
going to have to move fast, I’m 
afraid; we’re not safe even here. 
This Matthews is a dedicated sad- 
ist. Do you remember the pris- 
oner that was sent home with 
me? Well, Matthews tortured him 
to death yesterday, trying to get 
routine information out of him. 
He’ll do the same with your cap- 
tive if he gets his hands on him. 
He knows I’m here, of course. Ei- 
ther my telephone wire was 
tapped or he knew that you’d call 
me as soon as the news trickled 
down to him at CIO.” 



A n expression of revul- 
sion totally transformed 
Col. Singh’s lean brown face for 
a moment, but he said decisively: 
“So it’s come to that; they must 
be cut off from the real situation 
Outside almost entirely, and it’s 
their own fault. Well, I know what 
we can do. I have a private plane 
here and my pilot is the very 
best. We’ll just take ourselves up- 
stairs and defy this Matthews to 
get us down until we’re ready.” 
“Where are we going?” Jahnke 
asked. 

“I don’t know at the moment 
and it doesn’t matter. There are 
a lot of places to hide inside a 
thousand-mile radius where Mat- 
thews wouldn’t think of looking 
for us, if we have to hide. But I 
think I can pull his teeth through 
channels before it comes to that. 
Come on, better meet the pris- 
oner.” 

He led the way into the next 
room. The prisoner was looking 
at a book which, Jahnke could see 
as he put it aside, was mostly 
mathematics. He was an unusu- 
ally big specimen even for an 
Enemy, almost seven feet tall, 
with enormous shoulders and 
arms, a deep chest, and a brow 
which gave him an expression of 
permanent ferocity. He looked as 
though he could have torn Jahnke 
and the colonel to pieces without 
the slightest effort, as indeed he 
probably could. 



WRITING OF THE RAT

“Hrestce, John Jahnke,” Col. 
Singh said. 

“Seace tee ctisbe,” Jahnke said. 

“Tea.” Hrestce held out his 
hand and Jahnke took it, some- 
what nervously. Then, drawing a 
deep breath, he quickly outlined 
the situation, pulling no punches. 
When he got to the part about 
the death of Matthews’ prisoner, 
Hrestce only nodded; when 
Jahnke proposed that they leave, 
he nodded again. That was all. 

In the cabin of the plane, 
Jahnke started his tape recorder 
and got out his manuscript dic- 
tionary. With Hrestce’s first 
words, however, it became appar- 
ent that he wasn’t going to need 
the dictionary. The Enemy spoke 
simply, though with great dignity, 
and quickly found the speech- 
rate which was comfortable for 
Jahnke. When he spoke to Singh, 
he slowed down even more; he 
seemed already aware that 
Singh’s command of the language 
did not extend to high-order ab- 
stractions or subtle constructions. 

AM an emissary, as Colonel 
Singh surmised,” Hrestce 
said. “My mission is to apprise 
you of the search my people have 
been conducting and to take such 
further steps as your reaction dic- 
tates. By ‘you,’ of course, I mean 
mankind.” 

“What is the search?” Jahnke 
inquired, 

64 



“First I must explain some 
other matters,” Hrestce said. 
“You have some incomplete 
truths about us which should be 
completed right now. You know 
that we occupy many dissimilar 
civilizations; you suspect that 
they are not ours and that the 
original owners are gone. That is 
true. You think you have never 
seen our home culture. That is 
also true; our planet of origin is 
far out on the end of this spiral 
arm of the Galaxy, from which 
we have been working our way 
inward toward the center. You 
think we have usurped the origi- 
nal owners of these cultures. That 
is not true. We have another func- 
tion. We are custodians.” 

“Custodians?” Singh repeated. 

“Of cultures, of entire ecolo- 
gies. That is the role which has 
been thrust upon us. When we 
first mastered interstellar flight, 
sometime in the prehistory of your 
race, we found these abandoned 
planets by the hundreds. We 
found only a few inhabited ones, 
which I will describe in a mo- 
ment.” 

“The research that followed 
was tedious and I shall do no 
more than describe its results. 
Briefly, there is a race in the 
Galaxy whieh is praeticing slav- 
ery upon an incredible scale. We 
know who they are, for we have 
encountered several of their 
slave-planets, but they fight fero- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



t iously and without quarter, so 
lhat we have been unable to find 
out where they came from, or 
why they want so many billions 
and billions of slaves. Their usual 
practice, however, is to evacuate 
11 planet entirely; there is evi- 
dence of resistance on all the 
empty worlds, but the battles and 
losses were never large — evi- 
dently the slavers utterly over- 
whelmed them. The bones we 
find never account for more than 
11 tenth of the total population of 
the planet, usually much less. Yet 
the people are gone, leaving noth- 
ing behind but their effects, which 
the raiders seldom bother to loot. 

“We do not know how many 
of these conquered and enslaved 
races are still alive. Under the cir- 
cumstances, we have chosen to 
maintain each culture on its own 
terms, in the hope that at least 
some of them may be repos- 
sessed by their owners in the fu- 
ture, as we have already turned 
hack the liberated worlds. It is 
for that reason that we have 
evolved this synthetic language, 
which is adaptable to any culture 
and carries the implicit assump- 
tions of none.” 

The gray creature paused and 
the expression which crossed his 
face was something like a fleeting 
smile. “After speaking it for so 
many millenia, we find we rather 
like it. Some of us are doing crea- 
tive work in it.” 



“I like it very well,” Jahnke 
said. “It’s highly flexible; I should 
think it might make a good me- 
dium for poetry.” 

“There you make a statement 
with import for your race.” The 
smile, if that was what it had 
been, was gone without a trace. 
“It was your captivity, to some ex- 
tent, that deterred us from wiping 
you all out at once, as we have 
the power to do. For I must tell 
you plainly now that you are an 
outpost of the slavers we are 
seeking.” 

J AHNKE had seen it coming, 
if only hazily; but it hurt, all 
the same. 

“We were in doubt at first. 
Though the physical form is the 
same, your obvious creativity and 
your frequent flashes of sanity 
and decency seemed anomalous. 
Also, there seemed to be evidence 
that you had evolved on this plan- 
et. Further investigation disposed 
of that point, however; of all your 
presumptive ancestors, only the 
extinct half-simian, stone-throw- 
ing culture of South Africa is in- 
digenous to Earth. All the others, 
plus many forms that puzzle your 
naturalists, you brought with you 
from other planets — as slaves 
or food — and the stone-throwers 
you wiped out as being of too lit- 
tle intelligence to be useful. The 
Cro-Magnons, for example, were 
the descendants of the race of 



WRITING OF THE RAT 



65 



Vega III; there is no doubt what- 
ever about it” 

Jahnke asked hollowly: “What 
now? Since you have decided not 
to wipe us out — ” 

“There is the heart of the ques- 
tion,” Hrestce said. “You have 
been cut off a long time from the 
moral monsters who spawned 
you and during that time you 
have changed. Your race still re- 
verts to the parent type now and 
then: you produce an Alexander, 
a Khan, a Napoleon, a Hitler, a 
Stalin, a MacHinery — or a 
Matthews. But plainly, these are 
now sub-human types and will 
become even more rare with time. 

‘We have been hunting for the 
main body of these slavers for a 
long time. They have crimes be- 
yond number to answer for. They 
may have changed greatly in 
twenty-five thousand years, as 
you have changed; if so, we will 
be gratified. If they have not 
changed, we are prepared to de- 
stroy them down to the last mon- 
ster.” 

Hrestce paused and looked at 
the two men with somber feroc- 
ity. 

“The task is enormous,” he 
said, “because of the caretaking 
responsibilities that go with it. 
We would share it with someone 
if we could. We have decided to 
ask you if you would agree to 
to share it. The growth you have 
undergone is staggering; it shows 

66 



potentialities which we believe 
are greater than ours.” 

A long sigh exploded from 
Singh; evidently he had been 
holding his breath longer than he 
himself had realized. “ So all the 
time you were the rat-terriers and 
we were the rats. Matthews fits 
the description, all right. When I 
get through with him, he’s going 
to be breaking rocks.” 

As for Jahnke, he would have 
found it hard to say whether he 
was awed or elated, for both 
emotions had overwhelmed him 
at once. Matthews and his breed 
were certainly through; the Field 
officers had brought home not 
only the bacon, but the laurel 
wreath — not a bloody victory 
to be lived down, but a mighty 
standard to be followed. 

“Can we accept?” Jahnke 
breathed at last. 

The colonel stood shakily and 
went forward to the door of the 
control cubby. ‘West as she goes,” 
he told the pilot huskily. “For 
New Washington. And get me the 
Secretary-General on the radio.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

Piara Singh closed the door and 
came back. While the plane 
turned over the dark Atlantic, 
the three rat-terriers put their 
heads together. 

In some cupboard toward the 
center of the Galaxy, the writing 
of the rat was waiting to be read.

Medicine 

By FINN O'DONNEVAN 




O N MAY 2, 2103, Elwood 
Caswell walked rapidly 
down Broadway with a 
loaded revolver hidden in his coat 
pocket. He didn’t want to use the 
weapon, but feared he might any- 
how. This was a justifiable as- 
sumption, for Caswell was a homi- 
cidal maniac. 

It was a gentle, misty spring 
day and the air held the smell of 
rain and blossoming dogwood. 
Caswell gripped the revolver in 
his sweaty right hand and tried 
to think of a single valid reason 
why he should not kill a man 
named Magnessen, who, the other 
day, had commented on how well 
Caswell looked. 

What business was it of Ma^- 
nessen’s how he looked? Damned 
busybodies, always spoiling things 
for everybody. 



BAD MEDICINE 



69 



Caswell was a choleric little 
man with fierce red eyes, bulldog 
jowls and ginger-red hair. He was 
the sort you would expect to find 
perched on a detergent box, orat- 
ing to a crowd of lunching busi- 
nessmen and amused students, 
shouting, “Mars for the Martians, 
Venus for the Venusians!” 

But in truth, Caswell was unin- 
terested in the deplorable social 
conditions of extraterrestrials. He 
was a jetbus conductor for the 
New York Rapid Transit Corpor- 
ation. He minded his own busi- 
ness. And he was quite mad. 

Fortunately, he knew this at 
least part of the time, with at least 
half of his mind. 

OERSPIRING FREELY, Cas- 
well continued down Broad- 
way toward the 43rd Street 
branch of Home Therapy Appli- 
ances, Inc. His friend Magnessen 
would be finishing work soon, re- 
turning to his little apartment less 
than a block from Caswell’s. How 
easy it would be, how pleasant, 
to saunter in, exchange a few 
words and ... 

No! Caswell took a deep gulp 
of air and reminded himself that 
he didn’t really want to kill any- 
one. It was not right to kill peo- 
ple. The authorities would lock 
him up, his friends wouldn’t un- 
derstand, his mother would never 
have approved. 

70 



But these arguments seemed 
pallid, over-intellectual and en- 
tirely without force. The simple 
fact remained — he wanted to kill 
Magnessen. 

Could so strong a desire be 
wrong? Or even unhealthy? 

Yes, it could! With an agonized 
groan, Caswell sprinted the last 
few steps into the Home Therapy 
Appliances Store. 

Just being within such a place 
gave him an immediate sense of 
relief. The lighting was discreet, 
the draperies were neutral, the 
displays of glittering therapy ma- 
chines were neither too bland nor 
obstreperous. It was the kind of 
place where a man could happily 
lie down on the carpet in the 
shadow of the therapy machines, 
secure in the knowledge that help 
for any sort of trouble was at 
hand. 

A clerk with fair hair and a 
long, supercilious nose glided up 
softly, but not too softly, and mur- 
mured, “May one help?” 

“Therapy!” said Caswell. 

“Of course, sir,” the clerk an- 
swered, smoothing his lapels and 
smiling winningly. “That is what 
we are here for.” He gave Caswell 
a searching look, performed an in- 
stant mental diagnosis, and tap- 
ped a gleaming white-and-copper 
machine. 

“Now this,” the clerk said, “is 
the new Alcoholic Reliever, built 
by IBM and advertised in the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



leading magazines. A handsome 
piece of furniture, I think you 
will agree, and not out of place 
in any home. It opens into a tele- 
vision set.” 

With a flick of his narrow wrist, 
the clerk opened the Alcoholic 
Reliever, revealing a 52-inch 
screen. 

“I need — ” Caswell began. 

“Therapy,” the clerk finished 
for him. “Of course. I just wanted 
to point out that this model need 
never cause embarrassment for 
yourself, your friends or loved 
ones. Notice, if you will, the re- 
cessed dial which controls the de- 
sired degree of drinking. See? If 
you do not wish total abstinence, 
you can set it to heavy, moderate, 
social or light. That is a new fea- 
ture, unique in mechanotherapy.” 

46¥ AM not a alcoholic,” Caswell 
said, with considerable dig- 
nity. “The New York Rapid 
Transit Corporation does not hire 
alcoholics.” 

“Oh,” said the clerk, glancing 
distrustfully at Caswell’s blood- 
shot eyes. “You seem a little nerv- 
ous. Perhaps the portable Bendix 
Anxiety Reducer — ” 

“Anxiety’s not my ticket, either. 
What have you got for homicidal 
mania?” 

The clerk pursed his lips. 
“Schizophrenic or manic-depres- 
sive origins?” 

“I don’t know,” Caswell admit- 



ted, somewhat taken aback. 

“It really doesn’t matter,” the 
clerk told him. “Just a private 
theory of my own. From my ex- 
perience in the store, redheads 
and blonds are prone to schizo- 
phrenia, while brunettes incline 
toward the manic-depressive.” 
“That’s interesting. Have you 
worked here long?” 

“A week. Now then, here is just 
what you need, sir.” He put his 
hand affectionately on a squat 
black machine with chrome trim. 
“What’s that?” 

“That, sir, is the Rex Regener- 
ator, built by General Motors. 
Isn’t it handsome? It can go with 
any decor and opens up into a 
well-stocked bar. Your friends, 
family, loved ones need never 
know — ” 

“Will it cure a homicidal urge?” 
Caswell asked. “A strong one?” 
“Absolutely. Don’t confuse this 
with the little ten amp neurosis 
models. This is a hefty, heavy- 
duty, twenty-five amp machine 
for a really deep-rooted major 
condition.” 

“That’s what I’ve got,” said 
Caswell, with pardonable pride. 

“This baby’ll jolt it out of you. 
Big, heavy-duty thrust bearings! 
Oversize heat absorbers! Com- 
pletely insulated! Sensitivity 
range of over — ” 

“I’ll take it,” Caswell said. 
“Right now. I’ll pay cash.” 



BAD MEDICINE 



71 



“Fine! I’ll just telephone Stor- 
age and — ” 

“This one’ll do,” Caswell said, 
pulling out his billfold. “I’m in a 
hurry to use it. I want to kill my 
friend Magnessen, you know.” 

T he clerk ducked sympa- 
thetically. “Y ou wouldn’t 
want to do that. Plus five per 
cent sales tax. Thank you, sir. Full 
instructions are inside.” 

Caswell thanked him, lifted the 
Regenerator in both arms and 
hurried out. 

After figuring his commission, 
the clerk smiled to himself and 
lighted a cigarette. His enjoyment 
was spoiled when the manager, 
a large man impressively equip- 
ped with pince-nez, marched out 
of his office. 

“Haskins,” the manager said, “I 
thought I asked you to rid your- 
self of that filthy habit.” 

“Yes, Mr. Follansby, sorry, sir,” 
Haskins apologized, snubbing out 
the cigarette, “I’ll use the display 
Denicotinizer at once. Made rath- 
er a good sale, Mr. Follansby. One 
of the big Rex Regenerators.” 
“Really?” said the manager, 
impressed. “It isn’t often we — 
wait a minute! You didn’t sell the 
floor model, did you?” 

‘Why — why. I’m afraid I did, 
Mr. Follansby. The customer was 
in such a terrible hurry. Was there 
any reason — ” 

Mr. Follansby gripped his 



prominent white forehead in both 
hands, as though he wished to rip 
it off. “Haskins, I told you. I must 
have told you! That display Re- 
generator was a Martian model. 
For giving mechanotherapy to 
Martians.” 

“Oh,” Haskins said. He thought 
for a moment. “Oh.” 

Mr. Follansby stared at his 
clerk in grim silence. 

“But does it really matter?” 
Haskins asked quickly. “Surely 
the machine won’t discriminate. I 
should think it would treat a 
homicidal tendency even if the 
patient were not a Martian.” 
“The Martian race has never 
had the slightest tendency toward 
homicide. A Martian Regenerator 
doesn’t even possess the concept. 
Of course the Regenerator will 
treat him. It has to. But what will 
it treat?” 

“Oh, said Haskins. 

“That poor devil must be stop- 
ped before — you say he was 
homicidal? I don’t know what will 
happen! Quick, what is his ad- 
dress?” 

“Well, Mr. Follansby, he was in 
such a terrible hurry — ” 

The manager gave him a long, 
unbelieving look. “Get the police! 
Call the General Motors Security 
Division! Find him!” 

Haskins raced for the door. 
‘Wait!” yelled the manager, 
struggling into a raincoat. “I’m 
coming, too!”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



PPLWOOD CASWELL return- 
ed to his apartment by taxi- 
copter. He lugged the Regenera- 
tor into his living room, put it 
down near the couch and studied 
it thoughtfully. 

“That clerk was right,” he said, 
after a while. “It does go with the 
room.” 

Esthetically, the Regenerator 
was a success. 

Caswell admired it for a few 
more moments, then went into 
the kitchen and fixed himself a 
chicken sandwich. He ate slowly, 
staring fixedly at a point just 
above and to the left of his 
kitchen clock. 

Damn you, Magnessen! Dirty 
no-good lying shitty-eyed enemy 
of all that’s decent and clean in 
the world. 

Taking the revolver from his 
pocket, he laid it on the table. 
With a stiffened forefinger, he 
poked it into different positions. 

It was time to begin therapy. 

Except that. 

Caswell realized worriedly that 
he didn’t want to lose the desire 
to kill Magnessen. What would 
become of him if he lost that 
urge? His life would lose all pur- 
pose, all coherence, all flavor and 
zest. It would be quite dull, really. 

Moreover, he had a great and 
genuine grievance against Mag- 
nessen, one he didn’t like to think 
about. 

Irene! 



His poor sister, debauched by 
the subtle and insidious Magnes- 
sen, ruined by him and cast aside. 
What better reason could a man 
have to take his revolver and. 

Caswell finally remembered 
that he did not have a sister. 

Now was really the time to be- 
gin therapy. 

He went into the living room 
and found the operating instruc- 
tions tucked into a ventilation 
louver of the machine. He opened 
them and read: 

To Operate All Rex Model 
Regenerators: 

1. Place the Regenerator near 
a comfortable couch. (A comfort- 
able couch can be purchased as 
an additional accessory from any 
General Motors dealer.) 

2. Plug in the machine. 

3. Affix the adjustable contact 
band to the forehead. 

And that’s all! Your Regenera- 
tor will do the rest! There will 
be no language bar or dialect 
problem, since the Regenerator 
communicates by Direct Sense 
Contact (Patent Pending). All 
you must do is cooperate. 

Try not to feel any embarrass- 
ment or shame. Everyone has 
problems and many are worse 
than yours! Your Regenerator has 
no interest in your morals or 
ethical standards, so don’t feel 
it is ‘judging’ you. It desires only 
to aid you in becoming well and 
happy. 

As soon as it has collected and 



BAD MEDICINE 



73 



processed enough data, your Re- 
generator will begin treatment. 
You make the sessions as short 
or as long as you like. You are 
the boss! And of course you can 
end a session at any time. 

That’s all there is to it! Simple, 
isn’t it? Now plug in your Gen- 
eral Motors Regenerator and 
GET SANE! 

(iiTYOTHING HARD about 
* that,” Cassidy said to him- 
self. He pushed the Regenerator 
closer to the couch and plugged 
it in. He lifted the headband, 
started to slip it on, stopped. 

“I feel so silly!” he giggled. 

Abruptly he closed his mouth 
and stared pugnaciously at the 
black-and-chrome machine. 



“So you think you can make me 
sane, huh?” 

The Regenerator didn’t an- 
swer. 

“Oh, well, go ahead and try.” 
He slipped the headband over his 
forehead, crossed his arms on his 
chest and leaned back. 

Nothing happened. Caswell set- 
tled himself more comfortably on 
the couch. He scratched his 
shoulder and put the headband 
at a more comfortable angle. Still 
nothing. His thoughts began to 
wander. 

Magnessen! You noisy, over- 
bearing oaf, you disgusting — 

“Good afternoon,” a voice mur- 
mured in his head. “I am your

Caswell twitched guiltily. “Hel- 
lo. I was just — you know, just sort 
of—” 

“Of course,” the machine said 
soothingly. “Don’t we all? I am 
now scanning the material in your 
preconscious, with the intent of 
synthesis, diagnosis, prognosis and 
treatment. I find. .” 

“Yes?” 

“Just one moment.” The Re- 
generator was silent for several 
minutes. Then, hesitantly, it said, 
“This is beyond doubt a most 
unusual case.” 

“Really?” Cassidy asked, 
pleased. 

“Yes. The coefficients seem — 
I’m not sure. .” The machine’s 
robotic voice grew feeble. The

pilot light began to flicker and 
fade. 

“Hey, what’s the matter?” 
“Confusion,” said the machine. 
“Of course,” it went on in a strong- 
er voice, “the unusual nature of 
the symptoms need not prove en- 
tirely baffling to a competent 
therapeutic machine. A symptom, 
no matter how bizarre, is no more 
than a signpost, an indication of 
inner difficulty. And all symptoms 
can be related to the broad main- 
stream of proven theory. Since 
the theory is effective, the symp- 
toms must relate. We will pro- 
ceed on that assumption.” 

“Are you sure you know what 
you’re doing?” asked Caswell, 
feeling light-headed. 

^T^HE MACHINE snapped back, 
its pilot light blazing, “Me- 
chanotherapy today is an exact 
science and admits of no signifi- 
cant errors. We will proceed with 
a word-association test.” 

“Fire away,” said Caswell. 
“House?” 

“Home.” 

“Dog?” 

“Cat.” 

“Fleefl?” 

Caswell hesitated, trying to fig- 
ure out the word. It sounded 
vaguely Martian, but it might be 
Venusian or even — 

“Fleefl?” the Regenerator re- 
peated. 

“Marfoosh,” Caswell replied. 



making up the word on the spur 
of the moment. 

“Loud?” 

“Sweet.” 

“Green?” 

“Mother.” 

“Thanagoyes?” 

“Patamathonga.’ 

“Arrides?” 

“N exothesmodrastica .” 
“Chtheesnohelgnopteces? ” 
“Rigamaroo latasentricpropa- 
tria!” Caswell shot back. It was a 
collection of sounds he was par- 
ticularly proud of. The average 
man would not have been able 
to pronounce them. 

“Hmm,” said the Regenerator. 
“The pattern fits. It always does.” 
“What pattern?’ 

“You have,” the machine in- 
formed him, “a classic case of 
feem desire, complicated by 
strong dwarkish intentions.” 

“I do? I thought I was homici- 
dal.” 

“That term has no referent,” 
the machine said severely. “There- 
fore I must reject it as nonsense 
syllabification. Now consider 
these points: The feem desire is 
perfectly normal. Never forget 
that. But it is usually replaced at 
an early age by the hovendish re- 
vulsion. Individuals lacking in this 
basic environmental response — ” 
“I’m not absolutely sure I know 
what you’re talking about,” Cas- 
well confessed. 

“Please, sir! We must establish

one thing at once. You are the pa- 
tient. I am the mechanotherapist. 
You have brought your troubles 
to me for treatment. But you can- 
not expect help unless you co- 
operate.” 

“All right,” Caswell said. “I’ll 
try.” 

Up to now, he had been bathed 
in a warm glow of superiority. 
Everything the machine said had 
seemed mildly humorous. As a 
matter of fact, he had felt capable 
of pointing out a few things wrong 
with the mechanotherapist. 

Now that sense of well-being 
evaporated, as it always did, and 
Caswell was alone, terribly alone 
and lost, a creature of his com- 
pulsions, in search of a little peace 
and contentment. 

He would undergo anything to 
find them. Sternly he reminded 
himself that he had no right to 
comment on the mechanothera- 
pist. These machines knew what 
they were doing and had been do- 
ing it for a long time. He would 
cooperate, no matter how out- 
landish the treatment seemed 
from his layman’s viewpoint. 

But it was obvious, Caswell 
thought, settling' himself grimly 
on the couch, that mechanothera- 
py was going to be far more diffi- 
cult than he had imagined. 

^^HE SEARCH for the missing 
customer had been brief and 
useless. He was nowhere to be 



found on the teeming New York 
streets and no one could remem- 
ber seeing a red-haired, red-eyed 
little man lugging a black thera- 
peutic machine. 

It was all too common a sight. 

In answer to an urgent tele- 
phone call, the police came im- 
mediately, four of them, led by 
a harassed young lieutenant of 
detectives named Smith. 

Smith just had time to ask, 
“Say, why don’t you people put 
tags on things?” when there was 
an interruption. 

A man pushed his way past the 
policeman at the door. He was 
tall and gnarled and ugly, and his 
eyes were deep-set and bleakly 
blue. His clothes, unpressed and 
uncaring, hung on him like cor- 
rugated iron. 

“What do you want?” Lieuten- 
ant Smith asked. 

The ugly man flipped back his 
lapel, showing a small silver 
badge beneath. “I’m John Rath, 
General Motors Security Divi- 
sion.” 

“Oh. Sorry, sir,” Lieutenant 
Smith said, saluting. “I didn’t 
think you people would move in 
so fast.” 

Rath made a noncommittal 
noise. “Have you checked for 
prints. Lieutenant? The customer 
might have touched some other 
therapy machine.” 

“I’ll get right on it, sir,” Smith 
said. It wasn’t often that one of

the operatives from GM, GE or 
IBM came down to take a per- 
sonal hand. If a local cop showed 
he was really clicking, there just 
might be the possibility of an In- 
dustrial Transfer. 

Rath turned to Follansby and 
Hoskins, and transfixed them with 
a gaze as piercing and as imper- 
sonal as a radar beam. “Let’s have 
the full story,” he said, taking a 
notebook and pencil from a shape- 
less pocket. 

He listened to the tale in omi- 
nous silence. Finally he closed his 
notebook, thrust it back into his 
pocket and said, “The therapeutic 
machines are a sacred trust. To 
give a customer the wrong ma- 
chine is a betrayal of that trust, a 
violation of the Public Interest, 
and a defamation of the Com- 
pany’s good reputation.” 

The manager nodded in agree- 
ment, glaring at his unhappy 
clerk. 

“A Martian model,” Rath con- 
tinued, “should never have been 
on the floor in the first place.” 

“I can explain that,” Follansby 
said hastily. “We needed a dem- 
onstrator model and I wrote to 
the Company, telling them — ” 
“This might,” Rath broke in 
inexorably, “be considered a case 
of gross criminal negligence.” 

"OOTH THE manager and the 
clerk exchanged horrified 
looks. They were thinking of the 

78 



General Motors Reformatory out- 
side of Detroit, where Company 
offenders passed their days in sul- 
len silence, monotonously draw- 
ing micro-circuits for pocket tele- 
vision sets. 

“However, that is out of my jur- 
isdiction,” Rath said. He turned 
his baleful gaze full upon Haskins. 
“You are certain that the cus- 
tomer never mentioned h i s 
name?” 

“No, sir. I mean yes. I’m sure,” 
Haskins replied rattledly. 

“Did he mention any names 
at all?” 

Haskins plunged his face into 
his hands. He looked up and said 
eagerly, “Yes! He wanted to kill 
someone! A friend of his!” 

“Who?” Rath asked, with terri- 
ble patience. 

“The friend’s name was — let 
me think — Magneton! That was 
it! Magneton! Or was it Morri- 
son? Oh, dear. .” 

Mr. Rath’s iron face registered 
a rather corrugated disgust. Peo- 
ple were useless as witnesses. 
Worse than useless, since they 
were frequently misleading. For 
reliability, give him a robot every 
time. 

“Didn’t he mention anything 
significant?” 

“Let me think!” Haskins said, 
his face twisting into a fit of con- 
centration. 

Rath waited. 

Mr. Follansby cleared his 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



throat. “I was just thinking, Mr. 
Rath. About that Martian ma- 
chine. It won’t treat a Terran 
homicidal case as homicidal, will 
it?” 

“Of course not. Homicide is un- 
known on Mars.” 

“Yes. But what will it do? 
Might it not reject the entire case 
as unsuitable? Then the customer 
would merely return the Regen- 
erator with a complaint and we 
would—” 

Mr. Rath shook his head. “The 
Rex Regenerator must treat if it 
finds evidence of psychosis. By 
Martian standards, the customer 
is a very sick man, a psychotic — 
no matter what is wrong with 
him.” 

Follansby removed his pince- 
nez and polished them rapidly. 
“What will the machine do, 
then?” 

“It will treat him for the Mar- 
tian illness most analogous to his 
case. Feem desire, I should ima- 
gine, with various complications. 
As for what will happen once 
treatment begins, I don’t know. I 
doubt whether anyone knows, 
since it has never happened be- 
fore. Offhand, I would say there 
are two major alternatives: The 
patient may reject the therapy 
out of hand, in which case he is 
left with his homicidal mania un- 
abated. Or he may accept the 
Martian therapy and reach a 
cure.” 



^R. FOLLANSBY’S face 
brightened. “Ah! A cure is 
possible!” 

“You don’t understand,” Rath 
said. “He may affect a cure — of 
his non-existent Martian psycho- 
sis. But to cure something that is 
not there is, in effect, to erect a 
gratuitous delusional system. 
You might say that the machine 
would work in reverse, producing 
psychosis instead of removing it” 
Mr. Follansby groaned and 
leaned against a Bell Psychoso- 
matica. 

“The result,” Rath summed up, 
“would be to convince the cus- 
tomer that he was a Martian. A 
sane Martian, naturally.” 

Haskins suddenly shouted, “I 
remember! I remember now! He 
said he worked for the New York 
Rapid Transit Corporation! I 
remember distinctly!” 

“That’s a break,” Rath said, 
reaching for the telephone. 

Haskins wiped his perspiring 
face in relief. “And I just remem- 
bered something else that should 
make it easier still.” 

“What?” 

“The customer said he had 
been an alcoholic at one time. 
I’m sure of it, because he was in- 
terested at first in the IBM Alco- 
holic Reliever, until I talked him 
out of it. He had red hair, you 
know, and I’ve had a theory for 
some time about red-headedness 
and alcoholism. It seems — ” 



BAD MEDICINE

“Excellent,” Rath said. “Alco- 
holism will be on his records. It 
narrows the search considerably.” 
As he dialed the NYRT Cor- 
poration, the expression on his 
craglike face was almost pleasant. 

It was good, for a change, to 
find that a human could retain 
some significant facts. 

WOUT SURELY you remem- 
ber your goricae?” the Re- 
generator was saying. 

“No,” Caswell answered weari- 
ly- 

“Tell me, then, about your ju- 
venile experiences with the thora- 
strian fleep.” 

“Never had any.” 

“Hmm. Blockage,” muttered 
the machine. “Resentment. Re- 
pression. Are you sure you don’t 
remember your goricae and what 
it meant to you? The experience 
is universal.” 

“Not for me,” Caswell said, 
swallowing a yawn. 

He had been undergoing me- 
chanotherapy for close to four 
hours and it struck him as futile. 
For a while, he had talked volun- 
tarily about his childhood, his 
mother and father, his older broth- 
er. But the Regenerator had asked 
him to put aside those fantasies. 
The patient’s relationships to an 
imaginary parent or sibling, it ex- 
plained, were unworkable and of 
minor importance psychological- 
ly. The important thing was the 

80 



patient’s feelings — both revealed 
and repressed — toward his gori- 
cae. 

“Aw, look,” Caswell complain- 
ed, “I don’t even know what a 
goricae is.” 

“Of course you do. You just 
won’t let yourself know.” 

“I don’t know. Tell me.” 

“It would be better if you told 
me.” 

“How can I?” Caswell raged. “I 
don’t know!” 

“What do you imagine a gori- 
cae would be?” 

“A forest fire,” Caswell said. “A 
salt tablet. A jar of denatured al- 
cohol. A small screwdriver. Am 
I getting warm? A notebook. A re- 
volver — ” 

“These associations are mean- 
ingful,” the Regenerator assured 
him. “Your attempt at random- 
ness shows a clearly underlying 
pattern. Do you begin to recog- 
nize it?” 

“What in hell is a goricae?” 
Caswell roared. 

“The tree that nourished you 
during infancy, and well into pub- 
erty, if my theory about you is 
correct. Inadvertently, the gori- 
cate stifled your necessary rejec- 
tion of the feem desire. This in 
turn gave rise to your present 
urge to dwark someone in a vlen- 
dish manner.” 

“No tree nourished me.” 

“You cannot recall the experi- 
ence?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Of course not. It never hap- 
pened.” 

“You are sure of that?” 

“Positive.” 

“Not even the tiniest bit of 
doubt?” 

“No! No goricae ever nourished 
me. Look, I can break off these 
sessions at any time, right?” 

“Of course,” the Regenerator 
said. “But it would not be advisa- 
ble at this moment. You are ex- 
pressing anger, resentment, fear. 
By your rigidly summary re- 
jection — ” 

“Nuts,” said Caswell, and pull- 
ed off the headband. 

SILENCE was wonderful. 

Caswell stood up, yawned, 
stretched and massaged the back 
of his neck. He stood in front of 
the humming black machine and 
gave it a long leer. 

“You couldn’t cure me of a 
common cold,” he told it. 

Stiffly he walked the length of 
the living room and returned to 
the Regenerator. 

“Lousy fake!” he shouted. 

Caswell went into the kitchen 
and opened a bottle of beer. His 
revolver was still on the table, 
gleaming dully. 

Magnessen! You unspeakable 
treacherous filth! You fiend incar- 
nate! You inhuman, hideous mon- 
ster! Someone must destroy you, 
Magnessen! Someone . 

Someone? He himself would 



have to do it. Only he knew the 
bottomless depths of Magnessen’s 
depravity, his viciousness, his dis- 
gusting lust for power. 

Yes, it was his duty, Caswell 
thought. But strangely, the knowl- 
edge brought him no pleasure. 

After all, Magnessen was his 
friend. 

He stood up, ready for action. 
He tucked the revolver into his 
right-hand coat pocket and 
glanced at the kitchen clock. 
Nearly six-thirty. Magnessen 
would be home now, gulping his 
dinner, grinning over his plans. 

This was the perfect time to 
take him. 

Caswell strode to the door, 
opened it, started through, and 
stopped. 

A thought had crossed his 
mind, a thought so tremendously 
involved, so meaningful, so far- 
reaching in its implications that 
he was stirred to his depths. Cas- 
well tried desperately to shake off 
the knowledge it brought. But the 
thought, permanently etched 
upon his memory, would not de- 
part. 

Under the circumstances, he 
could do only one thing. 

He returned to the living room, 
sat down on the couch and slipped 
on the headband. 

The Regenerator said, “Yes?” 

“It’s the damnedest thing,” Cas- 
well said, “but do you know, I 
think I do remember my goricae!”

J OHN RATH contacted the 
New York Rapid Transit Cor- 
poration by televideo and was 
put into immediate contact with 
Mr. Bemis, a plump, tanned man 
with watchful eyes. 

“Alocoholism?” Mr. Bemis re- 
peated, after the problem was ex- 
plained. Unobtrusively, he turned 
on his tape recorder. “Among our 
employees?” Pressing a button 
beneath his foot, Bemis alerted 
Transit Security, Publicity, In- 
tercopany Relations and the Psy- 
choanalysis Division. This done, 
he looked earnestly at Rath. “Not 
a chance of it, my dear sir. Just 
between us, why does General 
Motors really want to know?” 
Rath smiled bitterly. He 
should have anticipated this. 
NYRT and GM had had their 
differences in the past. Officially, 
there was cooperation between 
the two giant corporations. But 
for all practical purposes — 

“The question is in terms of the 
Public Interest,” Rath said. 

“Oh, certainly,” Mr. Bemis re- 
plied, with a subtle smile. Glanc- 
ing at his tattle board, he noticed 
that several company executives 
had tapped in on his line. This 
might mean a promotion, if han- 
dled properly. 

“The Public Interest of GM,” 
Mr. Bemis added with polite nas- 
tiness. “The insinuation is, I sup- 
pose, that drunken conductors are 
operating our jetbuses and helis?”

“Of course not. I was searching 
for a single alcoholic predilection, 
an individual latency — ” 

“There’s no possibility of it. We 
at Rapid Transit do not hire peo- 
ple with even the merest tendency 
in that direction. And may I sug- 
gest, sir, that you clean your own 
house before making implications 
about others?” 

And with that, Mr. Bemis 
broke the connection. 

No one was going to put any- 
thing over on him. 

“Dead end,” Rath said heavily. 
He turned and shouted, “Smith! 
Did you find any prints?” 

Lieutenant Smith, his coat off 
and sleeves rolled up, bounded 
over. “Nothing usable, sir.” 

Rath’s thin lips tightened. It 
had been close to seven hours 
since the customer had taken the 
Martian machine. There was no 
telling what harm had been done 
by now. The customer would be 
justified in bringing suit against 
the Company. Not that the money 
mattered much; it was the bad 
publicity that was to be avoided 
at all cost. 

“Beg pardon, sir,” Haskins said. 

Rath ignored him. What next? 
Rapid Transit was not going to 
cooperate. Would the Armed 
Services make their records avail- 
able for scansion by somatotype 
and pigmentation? 

“Sir,” Haskins said again. 

“What is it?” 



“I just remembered the cus- 
tomer’s friend’s name. It was 
Magnessen.” 

“Are you sure of that?” 

“Absolutely,” Haskins said, 
with the first confidence he had 
shown in hours. “I’ve taken the 
liberty of looking him up in the 
telephone book, sir. There’s only 
one Manhattan listing under that 
name.” 

Rath glowered at him from 
under shaggy eyebrows. “Haskins, 
I hope you are not wrong about 
this. I sincerely hope that.” 

“I do too, sir,” Haskins ad- 
mitted, feeling his knees begin to 
shake. 

“Because if you are,” Rath said, 
“I will . Never mind. Let’s go!” 

"OY POLICE escort, they ar- 
rived at the address in fifteen 
minutes. It was an ancient brown- 
stone and Magnessen’s name was 
on a second-floor door. They 
knocked. 

The door opened and a stocky, 
crop-headed, shirt-sleeved man in 
his thirties stood before them. He 
turned slightly pale at the sight 
of so many uniforms, but held his 
ground. 

“What is this?” he demanded. 

“You Magnessen?” Lieutenant 
Smith barked. 

“Yeah. What’s the beef? If it’s 
about my hi-fi playing too loud, 
I can tell you that old hag down- 
stairs — ”

“May we come in?” Rath 
asked. “It’s important.” 

Magnessen seemed about to re- 
fuse, so Rath pushed past him, 
followed by Smith, Follansby, 
Haskins and a small army of po- 
licemen. Magnessen turned to 
face them, bewildered, defiant and 
more than a little awed. 

“Mr. Magnessen,” Rath said, in 
the pleasantest voice he could 
muster, “I hope you’ll forgive the 
intrusion. Let me assure you, it is 
in the Public Interest, as well as 
your own. Do you know a short, 
angry-looking, redrhaired, r e d - 
eyed man?” 

“Yes,” Magnessen said slowly 
and warily. 

Haskins let out a sigh of relief. 

“Would you tell us his name 
and address?” asked Rath. 

“I suppose you mean — hold it! 
What’s he done?’ 

“Nothing.” 

“Then what you want him for?” 

“There’s no time for explana- 
tions,” Rath said. “Believe me, it’s 
in his own best interest, too. What 
is his name?” 

Magnessen studied Rath’s ugly, 
honest face, trying to make up 
his mind. 

Lieutenant Smith said, “Come 
on, talk, Magnessen, if you know 
what’s good for you. We want 
that name and we want it quick.” 

It was the wrong approach. 
Magnessen lighted a cigarette, 
blew smoke in Smith’s direction 



and inquired, “You got a warrant, 
buddy?” 

“You bet I have,” Smith said, 
striding forward. “I’ll warrant you, 
wise guy.” 

“Stop it!” Rath ordered. “Lieu- 
tenant Smith, thank you for your 
assistance. I won’t need you any 
longer.” 

Smith left sulkily, taking his 
platoon with him. 

Rath said, “I apologize for 
Smith’s over-eagerness. You had 
better hear the problem.” Briefly 
but fully, he told the story of the 
customer and the Martian thera- 
peutic machine. 

When he was finished, Magnes- 
sen looked more suspicious than 
ever. “You say he wants to kill 
me?" 

“Definitely.” 

“That’s a lie! I don’t know what 
your game is, mister, but you’ll 
never make me believe that. El- 
wood’s my best friend. We been 
best friends since we was kids. We 
been in service together. Elwood 
would cut off his arm for me. And 
I’d do the same for him.” 

“Yes, yes,” Rath said impa- 
tiently, “in a sane frame of mind, 
he would. But your friend Elwood 
— is that his first name or last?” 

“First,” Magnessen said taunt- 
ingly. 

“Your friend Elwood is psy- 
chotic.” 

“You don’t know him. That guy 
loves me like a brother. Look,

85 



what’s Elwood really done? De- 
faulted on some payments or 
something? I can help out.” 

“You thick-headed imbecile!” 
Rath shouted. “I’m trying to save 
your life, and the life and sanity 
of your friend!” 

“But how do I know?” Magnes- 
sen pleaded. “You guys come 
busting in here — ” 

“You must trust me,” Rath 
said. 

Magnessen studied Rath’s face 
and nodded sourly. “His name’s 
Elwood Caswell. He lives just 
down the block at number 341.” 

^1 ^HE MAN who came to the 
door was short, with red hair 
and red-rimmed eyes. His right 
hand was thrust into his coat 
packet. He seemed very calm. 

“Are you Elwood Caswell?” 
Rath asked. “The Elwood Caswell 
who bought a Regenerator early 
this afternoon at the Home Ther- 
apy Appliances Store?” 

“Yes,” said Caswell. “Won’t you 
come in?” 

Inside Caswell’s small living 
room, they saw the Regenerator, 
glistening black and chrome, 
standing near the couch. It was 
unplugged. 

“Have you used it?” Rath 
asked anxiously. 

“Yes.” 

Follansby stepped forward. 
“Mr. Caswell, I don’t know how 
to explain this, but we made a 

86 



terrible mistake. The Regenera- 
tor you took was a Martian model 
— for giving therapy to Mar- 
tians.” 

“I know,” said Caswell. 

“You do?” 

“Of course. It became pretty 
obvious after a while.” 

“It was a dangerous situation,” 
Rath said. “Especially for a man 
with your — ah — troubles.” He 
studied Caswell covertly. The 
man seemed fine, but appearances 
were frequently deceiving, espe- 
cially with psychotics. Caswell 
had been homicidal; there was no 
reason why he should not still be. 

And Rath began to wish he 
had not dismissed Smith and his 
policemen so summarily. Some- 
times an armed squad was a com- 
forting thing to have around. 

Caswell walked across the 
room to the therapeutic machine. 
One hand was still in his jacket 
pocket; the other he laid affec- 
tionately upon the Regenerator. 

“The poor thing tried its best,” 
he said. “Of course, it couldn’t 
cure what wasn’t the r e.” He 
laughed. “But it came very near 
succeeding!” 

■pATH STUDIED Caswell’s 
face and said, in a trained 
casual tone, “Glad there was no 
harm, sir. The Company will, of 
course, reimburse you for your 
lost time and for your mental 
anguish — ” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Naturally,” Caswell said. 

“ — and we will substitute a 
proper Terran Regenerator at 
once.” 

“That won’t be necessary.” 

“It won’t?” 

“No.” Caswell’s voice was deci- 
sive. “The machine’s attempt at 
therapy forced me into a com- 
plete self-appraisal. There was a 
moment of absolute insight, dur- 
ing which I was able to evaluate 
and discard my homicidal inten- 
tions toward poor Magnessen.” 
Rath nodded dubiously. “You 
feel no such urge now?” 

“Not in the slightest.” 

Rath frowned deeply, started 
to say something, and stopped. 
He turned to Follansby and Has- 
kins. “Get that machine out of 
here. I’ll have « few things to say 
to you at the store.” 

The manager and the clerk 
lifted the Regenerator and left. 

Rath took a deep breath. “Mr. 
Caswell, I would strongly advise 
that. you accept a new Regenera- 
tor from the Company, gratis. Un- 
less a cure effected in a proper 
mechanotherapeutic manner, 
there is always the danger of a 
setback.” 

“No danger with me,” Caswell 
said, airily but with deep convic- 
tion. “Thank you for your consid- 
eration, sir. And good night.” 
Rath shrugged and walked to 
the door. 

“Wait!” Caswell called. 



Rath turned. Caswell had taken 
his hand out of his pocket. In it 
was a revolver. Rath felt sweat 
trickle down his arms. He calcu- 
lated the distance between him- 
self and Caswell. Too far. 

“Here,” Caswell said, extending 
the revolver butt-first. “I won’t 
need this any longer.” 

Rath managed to keep his face 
expressionless as he accepted the 
revolver and stuck it into a shape- 
less pocket. 

“Good night,” Caswell said. He 
closed the door behind Rath and 
bolted it. 

At last he was alone. 

Caswell walked into the 
kitchen. He opened a bottle of 
beer, took a deep swallow and sat 
down at the kitchen table. He 
stared fixedly at a point just 
above and to the left of the clock. 

He had to form his plans now. 
There was no time to lose. 

Magnessen! That inhuman 
monster who cut down the Cas- 
well goricae! Magnessen! The 
man who, even now, was secretly 
planning to infect New York with 
the abhorrent feem desire! Oh, 
Magnessen, I wish you a long, 
long life, filled with the torture I 
can inflict on you. And to start 
with . 

Caswell smiled to himself as he 
planned exactly how he would 
dwark Magnessen in a vlendish 
manner.

Nothing was simpler than the First Contact

T here are regulations to

Jan Maarten was gloomily pon-

atmosphere of Durell IV. He was 
a big, middle-aged man with thin

ash-blond hair and a round wor- 
ried face. Long ago, he had con- 
cluded that almost any rule was 
better than none. Therefore he 
followed his meticulously, but 
with an ever-present sense of un- 
certainty and human fallibility. 

These were ideal qualifications 
for the job of First Contacter. 

He circled the planet, low 
enough for observation, but not 
too low, since he didn’t want to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



frighten the inhabitants. He noted 
the signs of a primitive-pastoral 
civilization and tried to remem- 
ber everything he had learned in 
Volume 4, Projected Techniques 
tor First Contact on So-catled 
Primitive-pastoral Worlds, pub- 
lished by the Department of Al- 
ien Psychology. Then he brought 
the ship down on a rocky, grass- 
covered plain, near a typical me- 
dium-sized village, but not too 
near, using the Silent Sam land- 
ing technique. 

“Prettily done,” commented 
Crpswell, his assistant, who was 
too young to be bothered by un- 
certainties. 

Chedka, the Eborian linguist, 
said nothing. He was sleeping, as 
usual. 

Maarten grunted something 
and went to the rear of the ship 
to run his tests. Croswell took up 
his post at the viewport. 

C4TTERE THEY come,” Cros- 

•*■■■■ well reported half an hour 
later. “About a dozen of them, 
definitely humanoidal.” Upon 
closer inspection, he saw that the 
natives of Durell were flabby, 
dead - white in coloration and 
deadpan in expression. Croswell 
hesitated, then added, “They’re 
not too handsome.” 

“What are they doing?” Maar- 
ten asked. 

“Just looking us over,” Croswell 
said. He was a slender young 

All THE THINGS YOU ARE 



man with an unusually large and 
lustrous mustache which he had 
grown on the long journey out 
from Terra. He stroked it with 
the pride of a man who has been 
able to raise a really good mus- 
tache. 

“They’re about twenty yards 
from the ship now,” Croswell re- 
ported. He leaned forward, flat- 
tening his nose ludicrously against 
the port, which was constructed 
of one-way glass. 

Croswell could look out, but no 
one could look in. The Depart- 
ment of Alien Psychology had or- 
dered the change last year, after 
a Department ship had botched 
a first contact on Carella II. The 
Carellans had stared into the ship, 
become alarmed at something 
within, and fled. The Department 
still didn’t know what had 
alarmed them, for a second con- 
tact had never been successfully 
established. 

That mistake would never hap- 
pen again. 

“What now?” Maarten called. 

“One of them’s coming forward 
alone. Chief, perhaps. Or sacrifi- 
cial offering.” 

“What is he wearing?” 

“He has on a — a sort of — ^will 
you kindly come here and look 
for yourself?” 

Maarten, at his instrument 
bank, had been assembling a 
sketchy picture of Durell. The 
planet had a breathable atmos- 

89 



phere, an equitable climate, and 
gravity comparable to that of 
Earth. It had valuable deposits 
of radioactives and rare metals. 
Best of all, it tested free of the 
virulent micro-organisms and poi- 
sonous vapors which tended to 
make a Contacter’s life feverishly 
short. 

Durell was going to be a valu- 
able neighbor to Earth, provided 
the natives were friendly — and 
the Contacters skillful. 

]Y|AARTEN WALKED to the 
viewport and studied the na- 
tives. “They are wearing pastel 
clothing. We shall wear pastel 
clothing.” 

“Check,” said Croswell. 

“They are unarmed. We shall 
go unarmed.” 

“Roger.” 

“They are wearing sandals. We 
shall wear sandals as well.” 

“To hear is to obey.” 

“I notice they have no facial 
hair,” Maarten said, with the bar- 
est hint of a smile. “I’m sorry, Ed, 
but that mustache — ” 

“Not my mustache!” Croswell 
yelped, quickly putting a protec- 
tive hand over it. 

“I’m afraid so.” 

“But, Jan, I’ve been six months 
raising it!” 

“It has to go. That should be 
obvious.” 

“I don’t see why,” Croswell 
said indignantly. 



“Because first impressions are 
vital. When an imfavorable first 
impression has been made, subse- 
quent contacts become difficult, 
sometimes impossible. Since we 
know nothing about these people, 
conformity is our safest course. 
We try to look like them, dress in 
colors that are pleasing, or at 
least acceptable to them, copy 
their gestures, interact within 
their framework of acceptance, 
endeavor in every way — ” 

“All right, all right,” Croswell 
said. “I suppose I can grow an- 
other on the way back.” 

They looked at each other; 
then both began laughing. Cros- 
well had lost three mustaches in 
this manner. 

While Croswell shaved, Maar- 
ten stirred their linguist into 
wakefulness. Chedka was a lem- 
urlike humanoid from Eboria IV, 
one of the few planets where 
Earth maintained successful rela- 
tions. The Eborians were natural 
linguists, aided by the kind of as- 
sociative ability found in nui- 
sances who supply words in con- 
versation — only the Eborians 
were always right. They had wan- 
dered over a considerable portion 
of the Galaxy in their time and 
might have attained quite a place 
in it were it not that they needed 
twenty hours’ sleep out of twenty- 
four. 

Croswell finished shaving and 
dressed in pale green coveralls 



90

and sandals. All three stepped 
through the degermifier. Maarten 
took a deep breath, uttered a si- 
lent prayer and opened the port. 

A low sigh went up from the 
crowd of Durellans, although the 
chief — or sacrifice — was silent. 
They were indeed humanlike, if 
one overlooked their pallor and 
the gentle sheeplike blandness of 
their feaures — features upon 
which Maarten could read no 
trace of expression. 

“Don’t use any facial contor- 
tions,” Maarten warned Croswell. 

Slowly they advanced until 
they were ten feet from the lead- 
ing Durellan. Then Maarten said 
in a low voice, “We come in 
peace.” 



ten said they were wanderers 
from afar, come out of the Great 
Nothingness to engage in friendly 
discourse with the gentle people 
of Durell. He spoke of green and 
distant Earth, so like this planet, 
and of the fine and humble peo- 
ple of Earth who stretched out 
hands in greeting. He told of the 
great spirit of peace and coopera- 
tion that emanated from Earth, 
of universal friendship, and many 
other excellent things. 

Finally he was done. There 
was a long silence. 

“Did he understand it all?” 
Maarten whispered to Chedka. 

The Eborian nodded, waiting 
for the chief’s reply. Maarten was 
perspiring from the exertion and 
Croswell couldn’t stop nervously 
fingering his newly shaven upper 
lip. 

The chief opened his mouth, 
gasped, made a little half turn, 
and collapsed to the ground. 

It was an embarrassing mo- 
ment and one uncovered by any 
amount of theory. 

The chief didn’t rise; appar- 
ently it was not a ceremonial fall. 
As a matter of fact, his breathing 
seemed labored, like that of a 
man in a coma. 

Under the circumstances, the 
Contact team could only retreat 
to their ship and await further de- 
velopments. 

Half an hour later, a native ap- 
proached the ship and conversed 

91 



^HEDKA TRANSLATED, 
then listend to the answer, 
which was so soft as to be almost 
undecipherable. 

“Chief says welcome,” Chedka 
reported in his economical Eng- 
lish. 

“Good, good,” Maarten said. He 
took a few more steps forward 
and began to speak, pausing 
every now and then for transla- 
tion. Earnestly, and with extreme 
conviction, he intoned Primary 
Speech BB-32 (for humanoid, 
primitive - pastoral, tentatively 
non-aggressive aliens). 

Even Croswell, who was im- 
pressed by very little, had to 
admit it was a fine speech. Maar- 

ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE

with Chedka, keeping a wary eye 
on the Earthmen and departing 
immediately. 

“What did he say?” Croswell 
asked. 

“Chief Mor^ri apologizes for 
fainting,” Chedka told them. “He 
said it was inexcusably bad man- 
ners.” 

“Ah!” Maarten exclaimed. “His 
fainting might help us, after all 
— make him eager to repair his 
‘impoliteness.’ Just as long as it 
was a fortuitous circumstance, un- 
related to us — ” 

“Not,” Chedka said. 

“Not what?” 

“Not unrelated,” the Eborian 
said, curling up and going to 
sleep. 

IVTAARTEN* SHOOK the little 
linguist awake. “What else 
did the chief say? How was his 
fainting related to us?” 

Chedka yawned copiously. 
“The chief was very embarrassed. 
He faced the wind from your 
mouth as long as he could, but 
the alien odor — ” 

“My breath?” Maarten asked. 
“My breath knocked him out?” 

Chedka nodded, giggled unex- 
pectedly and went to sleep. 

Evening came, and the long 
dim twilight of Durell merged im- 
perceptibly into night. In the vil- 
lage, cooking fires glinted through 
the surrounding forest and 
winked out one by one. But lights 

ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE 



burned within the spaceship until 
dawn. And when the sun rose, 
Chedka slipped out of the ship 
on a mission into the village. 
Croswell brooded over his morn- 
ing coffee, while Maarten rum- 
maged through the ship’s medi- 
cine chest. 

“It’s purely a temporary set- 
back,” Croswell was saying hope- 
fully. “Little things like this are 
bound to happen. Remember that 
time on Dingoforeaba VI — ” 
“It’s little things that close 
planets forever,” Maarten said. 

“But how could anyone pos- 
sibly guess — ” 

“I should have foreseen it,” 
Maarten growled angrily. “Just 
because our breath hasn’t been 
offensive anywhere else — here 
it is!” 

Triumphantly he held up a bot- 
tle of pink tablets. “Absolutely 
guaranteed to neutralize any 
breath, even that of a hyena. 
Have a couple.” 

Croswell accepted the pills. 
“Now what?” 

“Now we wait until — aha! 
What did he say?” 

Chedka slipped through the 
entry port, rubbing his eyes. “The 
chief apologizes for fainting.” 

“We know that. What else?” 
“He welcomes you to the vil- 
lage of Lannit at your conven- 
ience. The chief feels that this 
incident shouldn’t alter the course 
of friendship between two peace- 

93 



loving courteous peoples.” 

Maarten sighed with relief. He 
cleared his throat and asked hesi- 
tantly, “Did you mention to him 
about the forthcoming — ah — 
improvement in our breaths?” 

“I assured him it would be cor- 
rected,” Chedka said, “although it 
never bothered me.” 

“Fine, fine. We will leave for 
the village now. Perhaps you 
should take one of these pills?” 
“There’s nothing wrong with 
my breath,” the Eborian said 
complacently. 

They set out at once for the 
village of Lannit. 

T¥7HEN ONE deals with a pri- 
” mitive-pastoral people, one 
looks for simple but highly sym- 
bolic gestures, since that is what 
they understand best. Imagery! 
Clear-cut and decisive parallels! 
Few words but many gestures! 
Those were the rules in dealing 
with primitive-pastorals. 

As Maarten approached the 
village, a natural and highly sym- 
bolic ceremony presented itself. 
The natives were waiting in their 
village, which was in a clearing 
in the forest. Separating forest 
from village was a dry stream 
bed, and across that bed was a 
small stone bridge. 

Maarten advanced to the cen- 
ter of the bridge and stopped, 
beaming benignly on the Durel- 
lans. When he saw several of 

94 



them shudder and turn away, he 
smoothed out his features, re- 
membering his own injunction on 
facial contortions. He paused for 
a long moment. 

“What’s up?” Croswell asked, 
stopping in front of the bridge. 

In a loud voice, Maarten cried, 
“Let this bridge symbolize the 
link, now eternally forged, that 
joins this beautiful planet with — ” 
Croswell called out a warning, 
but Maarten didn’t know what 
was wrong. He stared at the vil- 
lagers; they had made no move- 
ment. 

“Get off the bridge!” Croswell 
shouted. But before Maarten 
could move, the entire structure 
had collapsed under him and he 
fell bone-shakingly into the dry 
stream. 

“Damnedest thing I ever saw,” 
Croswell said, helping him to his 
feet. “As soon as you raised your 
voice, that stone began to pulver- 
ize. Sympathetic vibration, I 
imagine.” 

Now Maarten understood why 
the Durellans spoke in whispers. 
He struggled to his feet, then 
groaned and sat down again. 

“What’s wrong?” Croswell 
asked. 

“I seem to have wrenched my 
ankle,” Maarten said miserably. 

Chief Moreri came up, fol- 
lowed by twenty or so villagers, 
made a short speech and pre- 
sented Maarten with a walking 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stick of carved and polished 
black wood. 

“Thanks,” Maarten muttered, 
standing up and leaning gingerly 
on the cane. “What did he say?” 
he asked Chedka. 

“The chief said that the bridge 
was only a hundred years old 
and in good repair,” Chedka 
translated. “He apologizes that 
his ancestors didn’t build it bet- 
ter.” 

“Hmm,” Maarten said. 

“And the chief says that you 
are probably an unlucky man.” 

He might be right, Maarten 
thought. Or perhaps Earthmen 
were just a fumbling race. For 
all their good intentions, popula- 
tion after population feared them, 
hated them, envied them, mainly 
on the basis of unfavorable first 
impressions. 

Still, there seemed to be a 
chance here. What else could go 
wrong? 

Forcing a smile, then quickly 
erasing it, Maarten limped into 
the village beside Moreri. 

ri^ECHNOLOGICALLY, t h e 

Durellan civilization was of a 
low order. A limited use had been 
made of wheel and lever, but the 
concept of mechanical advantage 
had been carried no further. 
There was evidence of a rudi- 
mentary knowledge of plane ge- 
ometry and a fair idea of astron- 
omy. 

All THE THINGS YOU ARE 



Artistically, however, the Du- 
rellans were adept and surpris- 
ingly sophisticated, particularly 
in wood carving. Even the sim- 
plest huts had bas-relief panels, 
beautifully conceived and exe- 
cuted. 

“Do you think I could take 
some photographs?” Cr os we 11 
asked. 

“I see no reason why not,” 
Maarten said. He ran his fingers 
lovingly over a large panel, 
carved of the same straight- 
grained black wood that formed 
his cane. The finish was as smooth 
as skin beneath his fingertips. 

The chief gave his approval 
and Croswell tooks photographs 
and tracings of Durellan home, 
market and temple decorations. 

Maarten wandered around, 
gently touching the intricate bas- 
reliefs, speaking with some of the 
natives through Chedka, and gen- 
erally sorting out his impressions. 

The Durelleans, Maarten 
judged, were highly intelligent 
and had a potential comparable 
to that of Homo sapiens. Their 
lack of a defined technology was 
more the expression of a coop- 
eration with nature rather than a 
flaw in their makeup. They 
seemed inherently peace-loving 
and non-aggressive — valuable 
neighbors for an Earth that, after 
centuries of confusion, was striv- 
ing toward a similar goal. 

This was going to be the basis 

95 



of his report to the Second Con- 
tact Team. With it, he hoped to 
be able to add, A favorable im- 
pression seems to have been left 
concerning Earth. No unusual 
difficulties are to be expected. 

Chedka had been talking ear- 
nestly with Chief Moreri. Now, 
looking slightly more wide awake 
than usual, he came over and con- 
ferred with Maarten in a hushed 
voice. Maarten nodded, keeping 
his face expressionless, and went 
over to Croswell, who was snap- 
ping his last photographs. 

“All ready for the big show?” 
Maarten asked. 

“What show?” 

“Moreri is throwing a feast for 
us tonight,” Maarten said. “Very 
big, very important feast. A final 
gesture of good will and all that.” 
Although his tone was casual, 
there was a gleam of deep satis- 
faction in his eyes. 

Croswell’s reaction was more 
immediate. “Then we’ve made it! 
The contact is successful!” 

Behind him, two natives shook 
at the loudness of his voice and 
tottered feebly away. 

“We’ve made it,” Maarten 
whispered, “if we watch our step. 
They’re a fine, understanding peo- 
ple — but we do seem to grate 
on them a bit.” 

¥>Y EVENING, Maarten and 
Croswell had completed a 
chemical examination of the Du- 



rellan foods and found nothing 
harmful to humans. They took 
several more pink tablets, 
changed coveralls and sandals, 
bathed again in the degermifier, 
and proceeded to the feast. 

The first course was an orange- 
green vegetable that tasted like 
squash. Then Chief Moreri gave a 
short talk on the importance of 
intercultural relations. They were 
served a dish resembling rabbit 
and Croswell was called upon to 
give a speech. 

“Remember,” Maarten whis- 
pered, “whisper!" 

Croswell stood up and began to 
speak. Keeping his voice down 
and his face blank, he began to 
enumerate the many similarities 
between Earth and Durell, de- 
pending mainly on gestures to 
convey his message. 

Chedka translated. Maarten 
nodded his approval. The chief 
nodded. The feasters nodded. 

Croswell made his last points 
and sat down. Maarten clapped 
him on the shoulder. “Well done, 
Ed. You’ve got a natural gift for 
— what’s wrong?” 

Croswell had a startled and in- 
credulous look on his fact. 
“Look!” 

Maarten turned. The chief and 
the feasters, their eyes open and 
staring, were still nodding. 

“Chedka!” Maarten whispered. 
“Speak to them!” 

The Eborian asked the chief a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION^ 



96 



question. There was no response. 
The chief continued his rhythmic 
nodding. 

“Those gestures!” Maarten 
said. “You must have hypnotized 
them!” He scratched his head, 
then coughed once, loudly. The 
Durellans stopped nodding, 
blinked their eyes and began to 
talk rapidly and nervously among 
themselves. 

“They say you’ve got some 
strong powers,” Chedka trans- 
lated at random. “They say that 
aliens are pretty queer people 
and doubt if they can be trusted.” 

“What does the chief say?” 
Maarten asked. 

“The chief believes you’re all 
right. He is telling them that you 
meant no harm.” 

“Good enough. Let’s stop while 
we’re ahead.” 

He stood up, followed by Cros- 
well and Chedka. 

“We are leaving now,” he told 
the chief in a whisper, “but we 
beg permission for others of our 
kind to visit you. Forgive the mis- 
takes we have made; they were 
due only to ignorance of your 
ways.” 

^HEDKA TRANSLATED, and 
Maarten went on whispering, 
his face expressionless, his hands 
at his sides. He spoke of the one- 
ness of the Galaxy, the joys of 
cooperation, peace, the exchange 
of goods and art, and the essential 

ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE 



solidarity of all human life. 

Moreri, though still a little 
dazed from the hypnotic experi- 
ence, answered that the Earth- 
men would always be welcome. 

Impulsively, Croswell held out 
his hand. The chief looked at it 
for a moment, puzzled, then 
took it, obviously wondering 
what to do with it and why. 

He gasped in agony and pulled 
his hand back. They could see 
deep burns blotched red against 
his skin. 

“What could have — ” 

“Perspiration!” Maarten said. 
“It’s an acid. Must have an almost 
instantaneous effect upon their 
particular makeup. Let’s get out 
of here.” 

The natives were milling to- 
gether and they had picked up 
some stones and pieces of wood. 
The chief, although still in pain, 
was arguing with them, but the 
Earthmen didn’t wait to hear the 
results of the discussion. They 
retreated to their ship, as fast as 
Maarten could hobble with the 
help of his cane. 

The forest was dark behind 
them and filled with suspicious 
movements. Out of breath, they 
arrived at the spaceship. Cros- 
well, in the lead, sprawled over 
a tangle of grass and fell head- 
first against the port with a re- 
sounding clang. 

“Damn!” he howled in pain. 

The ground rumbled beneath 

97 



them, began to tremble and slide 
away. 

“Into the ship!” Maarten or- 
dered. 

They managed to take off be- 
fore the ground gave way com- 
pletely. 

46TT MUST have been sympa- 
thetic vibration again,” Cros- 
well said, several hours later, 
when the ship was in space. “But 
of all the luck — to be perched 
on a rock fault!” 

Maarten sighed and shook his 
head. “I really don’t know what 
to do. I’d like to go back, explain 
to them but — ” 

“We’ve outlived our welcome,” 
Croswell said. 

“Apparently. Blunders, nothing 
but blunders. We started out 
badly, and everything we did 
made it worse.” 

“It is not what you do,” Chedka 
explained in the most sympathe- 
tic voice they had ever heard 
him use. “It’s not your fault. It’s 
what you are.” 

Maarten considered that for a 
moment. “Yes, you’re right. Our 
voices shatter their land, our ex- 
pressions disgust them, our ges- 
tures hypnotize them, our breath 
asphyxiates them, our perspira- 
tion burns them. Oh, Lord!” 



“Lord, Lord,” Croswell agreed 
glumly. “We’re living chemical 
factories — only turning out poi- 
son gas and corrosives exclu- 
sively.” 

“But that is not all you are,” 
Chedka said. “Look.” 

He held up Maarten’s walking 
stick. Along the upper part, where 
Maarten had handled it, long- 
dormant buds had burst into pink 
and white flowers, and their scent 
filled the cabin. 

“You see?” Chedka said. “You 
are this, also.” 

“That stick was dead,” Cros- 
well mused. “Some oil in our skin, 
I imagine.” 

Maarten shuddered. “Do you 
suppose that all the carvings we 
touched — the huts — the tem- 
ple— ” 

“I should think so,” Croswell 
said. 

Maarten closed his eyes and 
visualized it, the sudden bursting 
into bloom of the dead, dried 
wood. 

“I think theyil understand,” he 
said, trying very hard to believe 
himself. “It’s a pretty symbol and 
they’re quite an understanding 
people. I think they’ll approve of 
— well, at least some of the 
things we are.”

^ I ^ HIS is a dramatically fasci-

doubt if there is any established 
writer who would not be tickled 
to claim this tense and well-writ-

It concerns the mission of an

tage and to bring back informa-

This yarn from Astounding S-F 
is the odyssey of the Fenian Ram 
and a gripping tale it is. 

SCIENCE-FICTION ADVEN- 
TURE IN MUTATION, edited 
by Grotf Conklin. The Vanguard 
Press, Inc., $3.75 

B y latest count, this is 
number five in Conklin’s 
“idea” series of anthologies. Un- 
like many rival anthologists, 
Conklin makes a concerted effort 
within the framework of his “idea” 
to give his audience as wide a se- 
lection as possible, at times even 
straying slightly beyond the lim- 
its, if story quality warrants. 

It would not be true to report 
that the average for the collec- 
tion runs A#l, but it certainly 
does better than B-plus. And it’s 
good to see old-timers like Miles 
J. Breuer and S. Fowler Wright 
represented, the latter with a yarn 
written for the anthology. 

CITIZEN IN SPACE by Robert 
Sheckley. Ballantine Books, Inc., 
35c 

B ALLANTINE’S second col- 
lection of Sheckley short 
stories shows the same unique ap- 

100 



proach to standard s-f plots as 
his first entry. An even dozen 
stories make up the book and 
Galaxy can proudly claim half. 

Remember “Hunting Problem,” 
which takes an old chestnut of a 
plot: Man on a hostile new plan- 
et turning out to be quarry in- 
stead of hunter? Make The Hunt- 
er an immature Scout of the 
Brave Bison Patrol going after 
the skins of bull Mirashes (Man) 
for his Scout Badge, endow him 
with the fantastic abilities of his 
incredibly advanced race, and you 
have a good idea of the ingredi- 
ents Sheckley uses in whipping 
up a tasty yarn. 

And how about “Skulking 
Permit,” concerning an isolated 
Earth colony which no longer has 
such proven items of civilization 
as a Jail, Post Office, Little Red 
Schoolhouse or even a Thief? 
With an imminent visit from 
Earth officials pending, who will 
be the Town Thief? 

The quality is not uniform — 
whose is? — but very high in in- 
ventiveness, ingenuity and read- 
er appeal.

category with its worthy fore- 
bears, even though Dikty is car- 
rying along without Bleiler, 
strange as that may sound to the 
ear after all these years. 

The selection of stories is large 
— twenty, including two novel- 
las, ranging from good to very 
good, although two could very 
well have been omitted. 

An excellent feature of the book 
is the Science Fiction Book In- 
dex, a complete compilation of 
all publications of 1954, assem- 
bled by Earl Kemp. Both the 
novellas, “Exile” by Everett B. 
Cole and “Nightmare Blues” by 
Frank Herbert who also wrote 
Dragon in the Sea, reviewed this 
month, appeared in Astounding 
S-F and are well worth reading. 

A big (over 500 pages) bar- 
gain, both in size and quality. 

ALTERNATING CURRENTS 
by Frederik Pohl. Ballantine 
Books, Inc., 35c 

S CIENCE fiction fans owe a 
debt of gratitude to Pohl for 
giving up his authors’ agency and 
concentrating on full-time writ- 
ing. This volume is a case in point 
to demonstrate his considerable 
versatility. It ranges from the 
horror of “Let The Ants Try” 
through the whimsical fantasy of 
“Grandy Devil” to the farcical 
“What To Do Until The Analyst 
Comes.” 



Readers of this magazine will 
remember the two longer works 
in the book. They are “The Map- 
makers,” a highly inventive yarn 
about a lost galactic charting ex- 
pedition with only a blinded nav- 
igator to rely on to get them 
home, and the disturbing mood- 
provocative “Tunnel Under The 
World” with its wallop ending. A 
must for anyone who enjoys the 
maturing of a talent. 

ON THE NATURE OF MAN 
by Dagobert D. Runes. Philo- 
sophical Library, $3.00 

T his is & straight philosophical 
essay, but I have included it 
in this month’s column because 
of the intriguing ideas of the au- 
thor concerning prehistoric Man. 
I have never seen elsewhere the 
visualization of early Man as a 
berry-picking, nut-eating vegetar- 
ian. 

According to Dr. Runes, Man 
never tasted meat until his intel- 
lect developed to the tool-making 
level, at which time he changed 
from a defensive animal to an 
omnivore. 

Is it possible that H. G. Wells 
in his classic A Story ol the Stone 
Age could have been that far off 
the beam?

L ast month’s Men, Micro- 
scopes and Living Things, 
which also began with Aristotle, 
set down personal details of the 
lives of ten scientists for the edi- 
fication of the young reader. 

This tome, which also concerns 
itself primarily with ten, ap- 
proaches them through their in- 
fluence on their contemporaries 
and, more important, on their im- 
pact on the world of their tomor- 
rows. 

No juvenile this, but an adult,

TALES OF CONAN by Robert 
E. Howard and L. Sprague de 
Camp. Gnome Press, $3.00 

T his is the sixth in the Conan 
series, which threatens never 
to end. Even though R. E. How- 
ard died approximately two dec- 
ades ago, it appears that “hitherto 
unpublished manuscripts” keep 
coming to view. 

In this instance, four unrelated 
adventures have been woven by 
L. Sprague de Camp into the Co- 
nan saga. Action and blood there 
are aplenty in the good old tra- 
dition and Howard fans will find 
exciting reading. As for me, I 
think de Camp did a remarkable 
job when he tossed his inhibi- 
tions to the wind and out-Con-

Ring of a few years back.

STAR SHIP ON SADDLE 
MOUNTAIN by Atlantis Hal- 
1am. The Macmillan Co., $2.50 

N OW there’s a sure-fire title 
for a juvenile if I ever saw 
one! Fortunately, the story lives 
up to its promise as it tells of 
Charley Holt, an orphaned young- 
ster, and his horse Navajo, and 
their experiences with the strange 
ship that landed between the 
humps of Saddle Mountain. The 
tale is particularly tense in the 
first half after Charley has made 
his discovery of the ship and its 
strange occupants and attempts 
to avoid capture. The fact that 
he doesn’t and suffers incarcera- 
tion on another planet as a result 
makes for an exciting book for 
teenagers.

than it is of H. P. Lovecraft’s 
“Colour out of Space” in flavor, 
but Hollywood’s ethereal choirs 
sound pretty good on wax as well.

Horrer Howce 

By MARGARET ST. CLAIR 

Atroshus speling, eh? Laff 
it off and what'll be more 
atroshusly parsed is — you! 



D ICKSON-HAWES’ face 
had turned a delicate 
pea-green. He closed the 
shutter on the opening very 
quickly indeed. Nonetheless, he 
said in nearly his usual voice, 
“I’m afraid it’s a trifle literary. 
Freeman. Reminds of that thing 
of Yeats’ — ‘What monstrous, 
beast. Its time come, uh, round 
again, slouches toward Bethlehem 
to be born?’ But the people who 
go to a horror house for amuse- 
ment aren’t literary. It wouldn’t 
affect them they way it did me.” 
He giggled nervously. 

No answering emotion dis- 



turbed the normal sullenness of 
Freeman’s face. “I thought there 
was a nice feel to it,” he said ob- 
stinately. “I wouldn’t have put so 
much time in on this stuff unless 
I thought you’d be interested. Re- 
search is more my line. I could 
have made a lot more money 
working on one of the govern- 
ment projects.” 

“You didn’t have much choice, 
did you?” Dickson-Hawes said 
pleasantly. “A political past is 
such a handicap, unless one’s will- 
ing to risk prosecution for per- 
jury.” 

“I’m as loyal as anybody! For

the last five years — eight, ten — 
all I’ve wanted to do was make 
a little cash. The trouble is, I al- 
ways have such rotten luck.” 
“Um.” Dickson-Hawes wiped 
his forehead unobtrusively. “Well, 
about your little effort. There are 
some nice touches, certainly. The 
idea of the monstrous womb, 
alone on the seashore, slowly 
swelling, and . .” In the folds of 
his handkerchief, he stifled a sort 
of cough. “No, I’m afraid it’s too 
poetic. I can’t use it, old chap.” 
The two men moved away 
from the shuttered opening. Free- 
man said, “Then Spring Scene is 
the only one you’re taking?” 

“Of those of yours I’ve seen. 
It’s horrid enough, but not too 
horrid. Haven’t you anything 
else?” Dickson-Hawes’ voice was 
eager, but eagerness seemed to be 
mixed with other things — reluc- 
tance, perhaps, and the fear of 
being afraid.

lower lip. “There’s the Well,” 
he said after a moment. “It needs 
a little more work done on it, but 
— I guess you could look at it.” 
“I’d be delighted to,” Dickson- 
Hawes agreed heartily. “I do hope 
you understand, old man, that 
there’s quite a lot of money in- 
volved in this.” 

“Yeah. You’ve really got the 
capital lined up? Twice before, 
you were sure you had big money 



interested. But the deals always 
fell through. I got pretty tired of 
it.” 

“This time it’s different. The 
money’s already in escrow, not to 
mention what I’m putting in my- 
self. We intend a coast-to-coast 
network of horror houses in every 
gayway, playland and amusement 
park.” 

“Yeah. Well, come along.” 

They went down the corridor 
to another door. Freeman un- 
locked it. “By the way,” he said, 
“I’d appreciate it if you’d keep 
your voice down. Some of the 
machinery in this stuff’s — deli- 
cate. Sensitive.” 

“By all means. Of course.” 
They entered. To their right 
was an old brick house, not quite 
in ruin. To the left, a clump of 
blackish trees cut off the sky. 
Just in front of them was the 
moss-covered coping of an old 
stone well. The ground around 
the well was slick with moisture. 

Dickson-Hawes sniffed appre- 
ciatively. “I must say you’ve paid 
wonderful attention to detail. It’s 
exactly like being out of doors. It 
even smells froggy and damp.” 
“Thanks,” Freeman replied 
with a small, dour smile. 

“What happens next?” 

“Look down in the well.” 
Rather gingerly, Dickson- 
Hawes approached. He leaned 
over. From the well came a gur- 
gling splash.

Dickson-Hawes drew back ab- 
ruptly. Now his face was not quite 
greenish; it was white. “My word, 
what a monster!” he gasped. 
“What is it, anyway?” 

“Clockwork,” Freeman an- 
swered. “It’ll writhe for thirty-six 
hours on one winding. I couldn’t 
use batteries, you know, on ac- 
count of the water. That greenish 
flash in the eyes comes from 
prisms. And the hair is the same 
thing you get on those expensive 
fur coats, only longer. I think they 
call it plasti-mink.” 

“What happens if I keep lean- 
ing over? Or if I drop pebbles 
down on it?” 

“It’ll come out at you.” 

ICKSON-HAWES LOOKED 
disappointed. “Anything 
else?” 

“The sky gets darker and noises 
come out of the house. Isn’t that 
enough?” 

Dickson-Hawes coughed. 
“Well, of course we’d have to soup 
it up a bit. Put an electrified rail 
around the well coping and per- 
haps make the approach to the 
well slippery so the customers 
would have to grasp the hand 
rail. Install a couple of air jets to 
blow the girls’ dresses up. And 
naturally make it a good deal 
darker so couples can neck when 
the girl gets scared. But it’s a nice 
little effort. Freeman, very nice 
indeed. I’m almost certain we can 

106 



use it. Yes, we ought to have your 
well in our horror house.” 

Dickson-Hawes’ voice had rung 
out strongly on the last few 
words. Now there came another 
watery splash from the well. Free- 
man seemed disturbed. 

“I told you to keep your voice 
down,” he complained. “The par- 
titions are thin. When you talk 
that loud, you can be heard all 
over the place. It isn’t good for 
the — machinery.” 

“Sorry.” 

“Don’t let it happen again . 
I don’t think the customers ought 
to neck in here. This isn’t the 
place for it. If they’ve got to neck, 
let them do it outside. In the 
corridor.” 

“You have no idea, old chap, 
what people will do in a darkened 
corridor in a horror house. It 
seems to stimulate them. But you 
may be right. Letting them stay 
here to neck might spoil the illu- 
sion. We’ll try to get them on 
out.” 

“Okay. How much are you pay- 
ing me for this?” 

“Our lawyer will have to dis- 
cuss the details,” said Dickson- 
Hawes. He gave Freeman a smile 
reeking with synthetic charm. “I 
assure you he can draw up a 
satisfactory contract. I can’t be 
more definite until I know what 
the copyright or patent situation 
would be.” 

“I don’t think my Well could 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




be patented,” Freeman said. 
“There are details in the machin- 
ery nobody understands but me. 
rd have to install each unit in 
your horror house network my- 
self. There ought to be a clause 
in the contract about my per 
diem expenses and a traveling al- 
lowance.” 

“I’m sure we can work out 
something mutually satisfactory.” 

“Uh . let’s get out of here. 
This is an awfully damp place to 
do much talking in.” 

'T'HEY WENT out into the hall 
again. Freeman locked the 
door. “Have you anything else?” 
Dickson-Hawes asked. 

Freeman’s eyes moved away. 
“No.” 

“Oh, come now, old chap. 
Don’t be coy. As I told you before, 
there’s money involved.” 

“What sort of thing do you 
want?” 

“Well, horrid. Though not quite 
so poetically horrid as what you 
have behind the shutter. That’s a 
little too much. Perhaps some- 
thing with a trifle more action. 
With more customer participa- 
tion. Both the Well and Spring 
Scene are on the static side.” 

“Uh.” 

They walked along the corri- 
dor. Freeman said slowly, “I’ve 
been working on something. 
There’s action and customer par- 
ticipation in it, all right, but I 



don’t know. It’s full of bugs. I just 
haven’t had time to work it out 
yet.” 

“Let’s have it, old man, by all 
means!” 

“Not so loud! You’ve got to 
keep your voice down. Otherwise 
I can’t take you in.” Freeman 
himself was speaking almost in a 
whisper. “All right. Here.” 

They had stopped before a 
much more substantial door than 
the one behind which the Well 
lay. There was a wide rubber 
flange all around it, and it was 
secured at top and bottom by two 
padlocked hasps. In the top of 
the door, three or four small holes 
had been bored, apparently to 
admit air. 

“You must have something 
pretty hot locked up behind all 
that,” Dickson-Hawes remarked. 

“Yeah.” Freeman got a key 
ring out of his pocket and began 
looking over it. Dickson-Hawes 
glanced around appraisingly. 

“Somebody’s been writing on 
your wall,” he observed. “Rotten 
speller, I must say.” 

Freeman raised his eyes from 
the key ring and looked in the 
direction the other man indicated. 
On the wall opposite the door, 
just under the ceiling, somebody 
had written HORRER HOWCE 
in what looked like blackish ink. 

The effect of the ill-spelled 
words on Freeman was remark- 
able. He dropped the key ring 



HORRER HOWCE 



107 



with a clatter, and when he 
straightened from picking it up, 
his hands were quivering. 

“I’ve changed my mind,” he 
said. He put the key ring back in 
his pocket. “I always did have the 
damnedest luck.” 

rviCKSON-HAWES LEANED 
back against the wall and 
crossed his ankles. “How do you 
get your ideas, Freeman?” 

“Oh, all sorts of ways. Things 
I read, things people tell me, 
things I see. All sorts of ways.” 
Both men were speaking in low 
tones. 

“They’re amazing. And your 
mechanical effects — I really 
don’t see how you get machinery 
to do the things you make it do.” 
Freeman smiled meagerly. 
“I’ve always been good at me- 
chanics. Particularly radio and 
signaling devices. Relays. Com- 
munication problems, you might 
say. I can communicate with any- 
thing. Started when I was a kid.” 
There was a silence. Dickson- 
Hawes kept leaning against the 
wall. A close observer. Freeman 
noticed almost a tic, a fluttering 
of his left eyelid. 

At last Freeman said, “How 
much are you paying for the 
Well?” 

Dickson-Hawes closed his eyes 
and opened them again. He may 
have been reflecting that while 
a verbal contract is quite as bind- 



ing as a written one, it is difficult 
to prove the existence of a verbal 
contract to which there are no 
witnesses. 

He answered, “Five thousand 
in a lump sum, I think, and a pro- 
rated share of the net admissions 
for the first three years.” 

There was an even longer 
silence. Freeman’s face relaxed at 
the mention of a definite sum. He 
said, “How are your nerves? I 
need money so damned bad.” 
Dickson-Hawes’ face went so 
blank that it would seem the 
other man had touched a vulner- 
able spot. “Pretty good, I imag- 
ine,” he said in a carefully modu- 
lated voice. “I saw a good deal of 
action during the war.” 

Cupidity and some other emo- 
tion contended in Freeman’s eyes. 
He fished out the key ring again. 
“Look, you must not make a 
noise. No yelling or anything like 
that, no matter what you see. 
They’re very — I mean the ma- 
chinery’s delicate. It’s full of bugs 
I haven’t got rid of yet. The 
whole thing will be a lot less 
ghastly later on. I’m going to keep 
the basic idea, make it just as 
exciting as it is now, but tone it 
down plenty.” 

“I understand.” 

Freeman looked at him with 
a frown. “Don’t make a noise,” he 
cautioned again. “Remember, 
none of this is real.” He fitted 
the key into the first of the pad- 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



locks on the stoutly built door. 

The second padlock was a lit- 
tle stilT. Freeman had to fidget 
with it. Finally he got the door 
open. The two men stepped 
through it. They were outside. 

f I ^HERE IS no other way of 
expressing it: They were out- 
side. If the illusion had been good 
in the Well, here it was perfect. 
They stood in a sort of safety 
island on the edge of a broad 
freeway, where traffic poured by 
in an unending rush eight lanes 
wide. It was the time of day 
when, though visibility is really 
better than at noon, a nervous 
motorist or two has turned on his 
parking lights. Besides the two 
men, the safety island held a 
new, shiny, * eggplant - colored 
sedan. 

Dickson-Hawes turned a be- 
wildered face on his companion. 
“Freeman,” he said in a whisper, 
“did you make all this?” 

For the first time. Freeman 
grinned. “Pretty good, isn’t it?” 
he replied, also in a whisper. He 
opened the car door and slid into 
the driver’s seat. “Get in. We’re 
going for a ride. Remember, no 
noise.” 

The other man obeyed. Free- 
man started the car — it had a 
very quiet motor — and watched 
until a lull in the traffic gave him 
a chance to swing out from the 
curb. He stepped on the acceler- 



ator. The landscape began to 
move by. 

Cars passed them. They passed 
some cars. Dickson-Hawes looked 
for the speedometer on the dash- 
board and couldn’t find it. A gar- 
age, a service station, a billboard 
went by. The sign on the garage 
read: WE FIX FLATTEDS. 

The service station had conical 
pumps. The tomatoes on the bill- 
board were purple and green. 

Dickson-Hawes was breathing 
shallowly. He said, “Freeman — 
where are we?” 

Once more, the other man 
grinned. “You’re getting just the 
effect I mean to give,” he retorted 
in a pleased whisper. “At first, 
the customer thinks he’s on an 
ordinary freeway, with ordinary 
people hurrying home to their 
dinners. Then he begins to notice 
all sorts of subtle differences. 
Everything’s a little off-key. It 
adds to the uneasiness.” 

“Yes, but — what’s the object 
of all this? What are we trying 
to do?” 

“Get home to our dinners, like 
everyone else.” 

“Where does the — well, dif- 
ficulty come in?” 

“Do you see that car in the 
outer lane?” They were still con- 
versing in whispers. “Black, bul- 
let-shaped, quite’ small, going 
very fast?” 

“Yes.” 

“Keep your eye on it.” 



HORRER HOWCE

The black car was going very 
fast. It caught up with a blue 
sedan in front of it, cut in on it 
and began to crowd it over to the 
curb. The blue sedan tried to 
shake off the black car, but with- 
out success. If the driver didn’t 
want to be wrecked, he had to 
get over. 

T?OR A while, the two cars ran 
parallel. The black car began 
to slow down and crowd more 
aggressively than ever. Suddenly 
it cut obliquely in front of the 
sedan and stopped. 

There was a frenzied scream 
of brakes from the sedan. It 
stopped with its left fender al- 
most against the black bullet- 
shaped car. The bodies were so 
close, there was no room for the 
sedan driver to open his door. 

Freeman had let the car he 
was driving slow down, presum- 
ably so Dickson-Hawes could see 
everything. 

For a moment, there was noth- 
ing to see. Only for a moment. 
Then two — or was it three? — 
long, blackish, extremely thin 
arms came out from the black car 
and fumbled with the glass in the 
window of the sedan. The glass 
was forced down. The arms en- 
tered the sedan. 

From the sedan there came a 
wild burst of shrieking. It was 
like the flopping, horrified 
squawks of a chicken at the chop>- 

1T0 



ping block. The shrieks were still 
going on when the very thin 
arms came out with a — 

The light hid nothing. The 
three very thin arms came out 
with a plucked-off human arm. 

They threw it into the interior 
of the black car. The three arms 
invaded the sedan once more. 

This time, Dickson-Hawes had 
turned neither white nor green- 
ish, but a blotchy gray. His mouth 
had come open all around his 
teeth, in the shap>e of a rigid ob- 
long with raised, corded edges. 
It was perfectly plain that if he 
was not screaming, it was solely 
because his throat was too para- 
lyzed. 

Freeman gave his passenger 
only a momentary glance. He was 
looking into the rear-view mirror. 
He began to frown anxiously. 

fT^HE SHRIEKING from the 
blue sedan had stopped. Dick- 
son-Hawes covered his face with 
his hands while Freeman drove 
past it and the other car. When 
the group lay behind them, he 
asked in a shaking whisper, 
“Freeman, are there any more of 
them? The black cars, I mean?” 

“Yeah. One of them’s coming 
toward us now.” 

Dickson-Hawes’ head swiveled 
around. Another of the black cars 
was hurtling toward them 
through the traffic, though it was 
still a long way behind. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Dickson-Hawes licked his lips. 

“Is it — after us?” 

“I think so.” 

“But why? Why — us?” 

“Part of the game. Wouldn’t 
be horrid otherwise. Hold on. I’m 
going to try to shake it off.” 

Freeman stepped down on the 
accelerator. The eggplant-colored 
sedan shot ahead. It was a very 
fast car and Freeman was evi- 
dently an expert and nerveless 
driver. They slid through non- 
existent holes in the traffic, 
glanced off from fenders, slipped 
crazily from lane to lane, a shut- 
tle in a pattern of speed and 
escape. 

The black car gained on them. 
No gymnastics. A bulletlike di- 
rectness. But it was nearer all the 
time. 

Dickson-Hawes gave a sort of 
whimper. 

“No noise,” Freeman cautioned 
in a fierce whisper. “That’ll bring 
them down for sure. Now!” 

He pressed the accelerator all 
the way down. The eggplant-col- 
ored car bounced and swayed. 
There was a tinkle of glass from 
the headlights of the car on the 
left as the sedan brushed it glanc- 
ingly. Dickson-Hawes moaned, 
but realized they had gained the 
length of several cars. Momen- 
tarily, the black pursuer fell be- 
hind. 

They went through two red 
lights in a row. So did the black 



bullet. It began to edge in on 
them. Closer and closer. Faster 
and faster. 

Dickson-Hawes had slumped 
forward with his head on his 
chest. The black car cut toward 
them immediately. 

Freeman snarled. Deliberately, 
he swung out into the path of the 
pursuer. For a second, it gave 
ground. 

“Bastards,” Freeman said 
grimly. 

The black car cut in on them 
like the lash of a whip. The sedan 
slithered. Hub caps grated on 
concrete. The sedan swayed 
drunkenly. Brakes howled. Dick- 
son-Hawes, opening his eyes in- 
voluntarily for the crash, saw 
that they were in a safety island. 
The same safety island, surely, 
from which they had started out? 

The black car went streaking 
on by. 

“I hate those things,” Freeman 
said bitterly. “Damned Voom. If 
I could — But never mind. We 
got away. We’re safe. We’re 
home.” 

T^ICKSON-HAWES DID not 
move. “I said we’re safe,” 
Freeman repeated. He opened 
the car door and pushed the other 
man out through it. Half-shoving, 
half-carrying, he led him to the 
door from which they had en- 
tered the freeway. It was still the 
time of day at which nervous mo-

torists turn on their parking 
lights. 

Freeman maneuvered Dickson- 
Hawes through the door. He 
closed it behind them and fast- 
ened the padlocks in the hasps. 
They were out in the corridor 
again — the corridor on whose 
wall somebody had written HOR- 
RER HOWCE. 

Freeman drew a deep breath. 
“Well. Worked better than I 
thought it would. I was afraid 
you’d yell. I thought you were 
the type that yells. But I guess 
the third time’s the charm.” 

“What?” 

“I mean I guess my goddam 
luck has turned at last. Yeah. 
What did you think of it?” 

Dickson-Hawes swallowed, un- 
able to answer. 

Freeman regarded him. “Come 
along to my office and have a 
drink. You look like you need 
one. And then you can tell me 
what you think of this setup.” 

The office was in the front of 
the house, down a couple of steps. 
Dickson-Hawes sank into the 
chair Freeman pulled out for 
him. He gulped down Freeman’s 
dubious reddish Bourbon grate- 
fully. 

After the second drink, he was 
restored enough to ask, “Freeman, 
was it real?” 

“Certainly not,” the other man 
said promptly. 

“It looked awfully real,” Dick- 



son-Hawes objected. “That arm 
. .” He shuddered. 

“A dummy,” Freeman an- 
swered promptly once more. 
“You didn’t see any blood, did 
you? Of course not. It was a 
dummy arm.” 

“I hope so. I don’t see how you 
could have made all the stuff we 
saw. There’s a limit to what ma- 
chinery can do. I’d like another 
drink.” 

Freeman poured. “What did 
you think of it?” 

Color was coming back to 
Dickson-Hawes’ cheeks. “It was 
the most horrible experience I 
ever had in my life.” 

Freeman grinned. “Good. Peo- 
ple like to be frightened. That’s 
why roller-coaster rides are so 
popular.” 

“Not that much, people don’t. 
Nobody would enjoy a roller- 
coaster ride if he saw cars crash- 
ing all around him and people 
getting killed. You’ll have to tone 
it down a lot. An awful lot.” 

“But you liked it?” 

“On the whole, yes. It’s a 
unique idea. But you’ll have to 
tone it down about seventy-five 
per cent.” 

P^REEMAN GRIMACED. “It 
can be done. But I’ll have to 
have a definite commitment from 
you before I undertake such ex- 
tensive changes.” 

“Urn.”

“There are other places I could 
sell it, you know,” Freeman said 
pugnaciously. “Jenkins of Amal- 
gamated might be interested. Or 
Silberstein.” 

“Jenkins lit out with about six 
thousand of Amalgamated’s dol- 
lars a couple of months ago. No- 
body’s seen him since. And they 
found Silberstein wandering on 
the streets last week in a sort of 
fit. Didn’t you know? He’s in a 
mental home. You won’t be sell- 
ing either of them much of 
anything.” 

Freeman sighed, but made no 
attempt to dispute these distress- 
ing facts. “Fll have to have a 
definite commitment from you 
before I make that many major 
changes,” he repeated stubbornly. 

“Well . .” Fright and whiskey 
may have made Dickson-Hawes 
a little less cautious than usual. 
“We could pay you fifty a week 
for a couple of months while you 
worked on it, as advance against 
royalties. If we didn’t like the 
final results, you wouldn’t have 
to give back the advance.” 

“It’s robbery. Apprentice me- 
chanics earn more than that. 
Make it sixty-five.” 

“I hfite haggling. Tell you what. 
We’ll make it sixty.” 

Freeman shrugged tiredly. 
“Let’.s get it down in black and 
white. I’ll just draw up a brief 



statement of the terms and you 
can sign it.” 

“Well, okay.” 

Freeman stooped and began 
to rummage in a desk drawer. 
Once he halted and seem to 
listen. He opened another drawer. 
“Thought I had some papier . 
Yeah, here it is.” He turned on 
the desk light and began to write. 

Dickson-Hawes leaned back in 
his chair and sippied at Freeman’s 
whiskey. He crossed his legs and 
recrossed them. He was humming 
“Lili Marlene” loudly and off 
pitch. His head rested against the 
wall. 

Freeman’s p>en moved across 
the paper. “That’s about it,” he 
said at last. He was smiling. 
“Yeah. I — ” 

There was a splintering crash, 
the sound of lath and plaster 
breaking. Freeman looked up 
from the unsigned agreement to 
see the last of his entrepreneurs 
— the last, the indubitable last — 
being borne off in the long black 
arms of the Voom. 

It was the first time they had 
gone through the partitions in 
search of a victim, but the parti- 
tions were thin and the unsuc- 
cessful chase on the highway had 
excited them more than Freeman 
had realized. There has to be a 
first time for any entity, even for 
Voom. 



HORRER HOWCE 



113 



FULL minutes passed. 

Dickson-Hawes’ shrieks died 
away. The third episode had 
ended just as disastrously as the 
earlier two. There wasn’t another 
entrepreneur in the entire U.S.A. 
from whom Freeman could hope 
to realize a cent for the contents 
of his horror house. He was sunk, 
finished, washed up. 

Freeman remained sitting at 
his desk, motionless. All his re- 
sentment at the bad luck life had 
saddled him with — loyalty oaths, 
big deals that fell through, chis- 
elers like Dickson-Hawes, types 
that yelled when the Voom were 
after them — had coalesced into 
an immobilizing rage. 

At last he drew a quavering 
sigh. He went over to the book- 
case, took out a book, looked up 
something. He took out a second 
book, a third. 

He nodded. A gleam of blind, 



intoxicated vindictiveness had 
come into his eyes. Just a few 
minor circuit changes, that was 
all. He knew the other, more 
powerful entities were there. It 
was only a question of changing 
his signaling devices to get in 
touch with them. 

Freeman put the book back on 
the shelf. He hesitated. Then he 
started toward the door. He’d 
get busy on the circuit changes 
right away. And while he was 
making them, he’d be running 
over plans for the horror house 
he was going to use the new en- 
tities to help him build. 

It would be dangerous. So 
what? Expensive . he’d get the 
money somewhere. But he’d fix 
them. He’d build a horror house 
for the beasts that would make 
them sorry they’d ever existed

ever human met human, no mat- 
ter how different, how distant, he 
wpuld come in peace, meet his 
own kind, speak his own tongue. 

THE SKIILS OF XANADU 



Humans, however, being hu- 
mans — 

BRIL emerged near the pink 
star, disliking its light, and found 
the fourth planet. It hung waiting 
for him like an exotic fruit. (And 
was it ripe, and could he ripen 

!I7 




it? And what if it were poison?) 
He left his machine in orbit and 
descended in a bubble. A young 
savage watched him come and 
waited by a waterfall. 

“Earth was my mother,” said 
Bril from the bubble. It was the 
formal greeting of all humankind, 
spoken in the Old Tongue. 

“And my father,” said the sav- 
age, in an atrocious accent. 

Watchfully, Bril emerged from 
the bubble, but stood very close 
by it. He completed his part of 
the ritual. “I respect the disparity 
of our wants, as individuals, and 
greet you.” 

“I respect the identity of our 
needs, as humans, and greet you. 
I am Wonyne,” said the youth, 
“son of Tanyne, of the Senate, and 
Nina. This place is Xanadu, the 
district, on Xanadu, the fourth 
planet.” 

“I am Bril of Kit Carson, sec- 
ond planet of the Sumner Sys- 
tem, and a member of the Sole 
Authority,” said the newcomer, 
adding, “and I come in peace.” 

TIE WAITED then, to see if 
the savage would discard 
any weapons he might have, ac- 
cording to historic protocol. Wo- 
nyne did not; he apparently had 
none. He wore only a cobwebby 
tunic and a broad belt made of 
flat, black, brilliantly polished 
stones and could hardly have con- 
cealed so much as a dart. Bril 

118 



waited yet another moment, 
watching the untroubled face of 
the savage, to see if Wonyne sus- 
pected anything of the arsenal 
hidden in the sleek black uni- 
form, the gleaming jackboots, the 
metal gauntlets. 

Wonyne said only, “Then, in 
peace, welcome.” He smiled. 
“Come with me to Tanyne’s 
house and mine, and be re- 
freshed.” 

“You say Tanyne, your father, 
is a Senator? Is he active now? 
Could he help me to reach your 
center of government?” 

The youth paused, his lips 
moving slightly, as if he were 
translating the dead language 
into another tongue. Then, “Yes. 
Oh, yes.” 

Bril flicked his left gauntlet 
with his right fingertips and the 
bubble sprang away and up, 
where at length it would join the 
ship untjl it was needed. Wonyne 
was not amazed — probably, 
thought Bril, because it was be- 
yond his understanding. 

Bril followed the youth up a 
winding path past a wonderland 
of flowering plants, most of them 
purple, some white, a few scarlet, 
and all jeweled by the waterfall. 
The higher reaches of the path 
were flanked by thick soft grass, 
red as they approached, pale 
pink as they passed. 

Bril’s narrow black eyes flicked 
everywhere, saw and recorded ev- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



erything: the easy-breathing boy 
spring up the slope ahead, and 
the constant shifts of color in his 
gossamer garment as the wind 
touched it; the high trees, some 
of which might conceal a man or 
a weapon; the rock outcroppings 
and what oxides they told of; the 
birds he could see and the bird- 
songs he heard which might be 
something else. 

He was a man who missed 
only the obvious, and there is so 
little that is obvious. 

Yet he was not prepared for 
the house; he and the boy were 
halfway across the parklike land 
which surrounded it before he 
recognized it as such. 

It seemed to have no margins. 
It was here high and there only 
a place between flower beds; yon- 
der a room became a terrace, and 
elsewhere a lawn was a carpet 
because there was a roof over it. 
The house was divided into areas 
rather than rooms, by open grilles 
and by arrangements of color. 
Nowhere was there a wall. There 
was nothing to hide behind and 
nothing that could be locked. All 
the land, all the sky, looked into 
and through the house, and the 
house was one great window on 
the world. 

Seeing it, Bril felt a slight shift 
in his opinion of the natives. His 
feeling was still one of contempt, 
but now he added suspicion. A 
cardinal dictum on humans as 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



he knew them was: Every man 
has something to hide. Seeing a 
mode of living like this did not 
make him change his dictum: he 
simply increased his watchful- 
ness, asking: How do they hide 
it? 

“Tan! Tan!” the boy was shout- 
ing. “I’ve brought a friend!” 

A MAN and a woman strolled 
toward them from a garden. 
The man was huge, but otherwise 
so like the youth Wonyne that 
there could be no question of their 
relationship. Both had long, nar- 
row, clear gray eyes set very wide 
apart, and red — almost orange 
— hair. The noses were strong 
and delicate at the same time, 
their mouths thin-lipped but wide 
and good-natured. 

But the woman — 

It was a long time before Bril 
could let himself look, let himself 
believe that there was such a 
woman. After his first glance, he 
made of her only a presence and 
fed himself small nibbles of belief 
in his eyes, in the fact that there 
could be hair like that, face, voice, 
body. She was dressed, like her 
husband and the boy, in the 
smoky kaleidoscope which re- 
solved itself, when the wind per- 
mitted, into a black-belted tunic. 

“He is Bril of Kit Carson in 
the Sumner System,” babbled the 
boy, “and he’s a member of the 
Sole Authority and it’s the second 

119 



planet and he knew the greeting 
and got it right. So did I,” he 
added, laughing. “This is Tanyne, 
of the Senate, and my mother 
Nina.” 

“You are welcome, Bril of Kit 
Carson,” she said to him; and un- 
believing in this way that had 
come upon him, he took away 
his gaze and inclined his head. 

“You must come in,” said Ta- 
nyne cordially, and led the way 
through an arbor which was not 
the separate arch it appeared to 
be, but an entrance. 

The room was wide, wider at 
one end than the other, though 
it was hard to determine by how 
much. The floor was uneven, 
graded upward toward one cor- 
ner, where it was a mossy bank. 
Scattered here and there were 
what the eye said were white and 
striated gray boulders; the hand 
would say they were flesh. Ex- 
cept for a few shelf- and tablelike 
niches on these and in the bank, 
they were the only furniture. 

Water ran frothing and gur- 
gling through the room, appar- 
ently as an open brook; but Bril 
saw Nina’s bare foot tread on the 
invisible covering that followed 
it down to the pool at the other 
end. The pool was the one he had 
seen from outside, indeterminate- 
ly in and out of the house. A 
large tree grew by the pool and 
leaned its heavy branches toward 
the bank, and evidently its wide- 

120 



flung limbs were webbed and 
tented between by the same in- 
visible substance which covered 
the brook, or they formed the 
only cover overhead yet, to the 
ear, felt like a ceiling. 

The whole effect was, to Bril, 
intensely depressing, and he sur- 
prised himself with a flash of 
homesickness for the tall steel 
cities of his home planet. 

Nina smiled and left them. Bril 
followed his host’s example and 
sank down on the ground, or 
floor, where it became a bank, or 
wall. Inwardly, Bril rebelled at 
the lack of decisiveness, of disci- 
pline, of clear-cut limitation in- 
herent in such haphazard design 
as this. But he was well trained 
and quite prepared, at first, to 
keep his feelings to himself 
among barbarians. 

“Nina will join us in a mo- 
ment,” said Tanyne. 

Bril, who had been watching 
the woman’s swift movements 
across the courtyard through the 
transparent wall opposite, con- 
trolled a start. “I am unused to 
your ways, and wondered what 
she was doing,” he said. 

“She is preparing a meal for 
you,” explained Tanyne. 

“Herself?” 

^^ANYNE and his son gazed 
wonderingly. “Does that seem 
unusual to you?” 

“I understood the lady was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wife to a Senator,” said Bril. It 
seemed adequate as an explana- 
tion, but only to him. He looked 
from the boy’s face to the man’s. 
“Perhaps I understand something 
different when I use the term 
‘Senator.’ ” 

“Perhaps you do. Would you 
tell us what a Senator is on the 
planet Kit Carson?” 

“He is a member of the Sen- 
ate, subservient to the Sole Au- 
thority, and in turn leader of a 
free Nation.” 

“And his wife?” 

“His wife shares his privileges. 
She might serve a member of the 
Sole Authority, but hardly any- 
one else — certainly not an uni- 
dentified stranger.” 

“Interesting,”^ said Tanyne, 
while the boy murmured the as- 
tonishment he had not expressed 
at Bril’s bubble, or Bril himself. 
“Tell me, have you not identified 
yourself, then?” 

“He did, by the waterfall,” the 
youth insisted. 

“I gave you no proof,” said 
Bril stiffly. He watched father 
and son exchanged a glance. “Cre- 
dentials, written authority.” He 
touched the flat pouch hung on 
his power belt. 

Wonyne asked ingenuously, 
“Do the credentials say you are 
not Bril of Kit Carson in the 
Sumner System?” 

Bril frowned at him, and Ta- 
nyne said gently, “Wonyne, take 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



care.” To Bril, he said, “Surely 
there are many differences be- 
tween us, as there always are be- 
tween different worlds. But I am 
certain of this one similarity; the 
young at times run straight where 
wisdom has built a winding path.” 
Bril sat silently and thought 
this out. It was probably some 
sort of apology, he decided, and 
gave a single sharp nod. Youth, 
he thought, was an attenuated de- 
fect here. A boy Wonyne’s age 
would be a soldier on Carson, 
ready for a soldier’s work, and 
no one would be apologizing for 
him. Nor would he be making 
blunders. None! 

He said, “These credentials are 
for your officials when I meet 
with them. By the way, when can 
that be?” 

Tanyne shrugged his wide 
shoulders. “Whenever you like.” 
“The sooner the better.” 

“Very well.” 

“Is it far?” 

Tanyne seemed perplexed. “Is 
what far?” 

“Your capital, or wherever it 
is your Senate meets.” 

“Oh, I see. It doesn’t meet, in 
the sense you mean. It is always 
in session, though, as they used 
to say. We — ” 

TTE COMPRESSED his lips 
and made a liquid, bisyllabic 
sound. Then he laughed. “I do 
beg your pardon,” he said warmly. 

121 



“The Old Tongue lacks certain 
words, certain concepts. What is 
your word for — er — the - pres- 
ence - of - all - in - the - presence - 
of - one?” 

“I think,” said Bril carefully, 
“that we had better go back to 
the subject at hand. Are you say- 
ing that your Senate does not 
meet in some official place, at 
some appointed time?” 

“I — ” Tan hesitated, then nod- 
ded. “Yes, that is true as far as 
it — ” 

“And there is no possibility of 
my addressing your Senate in 
person?” 

“I didn’t say that.” Tan tried 
twice to express the thought, while 
Bril’s eyes slowly narrowed. Tan 
suddenly burst into laughter. “Us- 
ing the Old Tongue to tell old 
tales and to speak with a friend 
are two different things,” he said 
ruefully. “I wish you would learn 
our speech. Would you, do you 
suppose? It is rational and well 
based on what you know. Surely 
you have another language be- 
sides the Old Tongue on Kit 
Carson?” 

“I honor the Old Tongue,” said 
Bril stiffly, dodging the question. 
Speaking very slowly, as if to a 
retarded child, he said, “I should 
like to know when I may be 
taken to those in authority here, 
in order to discuss certain plane- 
tary and interplanetary matters 
with them.” 

122 



“Discuss them with me.” 

“You are a Senator,” Bril said, 
in a tone which meant clearly: 
You are only a Senator. 

“True,” said Tanyne. 

With forceful patience, Bril 
asked, “And what is a Senator 
here?” 

“A contact point between the 
people of his district and the peo- 
ple everywhere. One who knows 
the special problems of a small 
section of the planet and can re- 
late them to planetary policy.” 
“And whom does the Senate 
serve?” 

“The people,” said Tanyne, as 
if he had been asked to repeat 
himself. 

“Yes, yes, of course. And who, 
then, serves the Senate?” 

“The Senators.” 

Bril closed his eyes and barely 
controlled the salty syllable which 
welled up inside him. “Who,” he 
inquired steadily, “is your Gov- 
ernment?” 

The boy had been watching 
them eagerly, alternately, like a 
devotee at some favorite fast ball 
game. Now he asked, “What’s a 
Government?” 

l^INA’s interruption at that 
’ point was most welcome to 
Bril. She came across the terrace 
from the covered area where she 
had been doing mysterious things 
at a long work-surface in the gar- 
den. She carried an enormous 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tray — guided it, rather, as Bril 
saw when she came closer. She 
kept three fingers under the tray 
and one behind it, barely touch- 
ing it with her palm. Either the 
transparent wall of the room dis- 
appeared as she approached, or 
she passed through a section 
where there was none. 

“I do hope you find something 
to your taste among these,” she 
said cheerfully, as she brought 
the tray down to a hummock 
near Bril. “This is the flesh of 
birds, this of small mammals, 
and, over here, fish. These cakes 
are made of four kinds of grain, 
and the white cakes here of just 
one, the one we call milk-wheat. 
Here is water, and these two are 
wines, and this one is a distilled 
spirit we call warm-ears.” 

Bril, keeping his eyes on the 
food, and trying to keep his uni- 
verse from filling up with the 
sweet fresh scent of her as she 
bent over him, so near, said, 
“This is welcome.” 

She crossed to her husband and 
sank down at his feet, leaning 
back against his legs. He twisted 
her heavy hair gently in his fin- 
gers and she flashed a small smile 
up at him. Bril looked from the 
food, colorful as a corsage, here 
steaming, there gathering frost 
from the air, to the three smiling 
expectant faces, and did not know 
what to do. 

“Yes, this is welcome,” he said 
THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



again, and still they sat there, 
watching him. He picked up the 
white cake and rose, looked out 
and around, into the house, 
through it and beyond. Where 
could one go in such a place? 

Steam from the tray touched 
his nostrils and saliva filled his 
mouth. He was hungry, but . 

He sighed, sat down, gently 
replaced the cake. He tried to 
smile and could not. 

“Does none of it please you?” 
asked Nina, concerned. 

“I can’t eat here!” said Bril; 
then, sensing something in the 
natives that had not been there 
before, he added, “thank you.” 
Again he looked at their con- 
trolled faces. He said to Nina, 
“It is very well prepared and 
good to look on.” 

“Then eat,” she invited, smil- 
ing again. 

This did something that their 
house, their garments, their ap- 
pallingly easy ways — sprawling 
all over the place, letting their 
young speak up at will, the 
shameless admission that they 
had a patois of their own — that 
none of these things had been able 
to do. Without losing his implac- 
able dignity by any slightest 
change of expression, he yet 
found himself blushing. Then he 
scowled and let the childish dis- 
play turn to a flush of anger. He 
would be glad, he thought furi- 
ously, when he had the heart of 

123 



this culture in the palm of his 
hand, to squeeze when he willed; 
then there would be an end to 
these hypocrital amenities and 
they would learn who could be 
humiliated. 

T>UT these three faces, the 
boy’s so open and unconscious 
of wrong, Tanyne’s so strong and 
anxious for him, Nina’s — that 
face, that face of Nina’s — they 
were all utterly guileless. He 
must not let them know of his 
embarrassment. If they had 
planned it, he must not give them 
the satisfaction. If they had not 
planned it, he must not let them 
suspect his vulnerability. 

With an immense effort of will, 
he kept his voice low; still, it was 
harsh. “I think,” he said slowly, 
“that we on Kit Carson regard 
the matter of privacy perhaps a 
little more highly than you do." 

They exchanged an astonished 
look, and then comprehension 
dawned visibly on Tanyne’s rud- 
dy face. “You don’t eat together!” 
Bril did not shudder, but it 
was in his word : “No.” 

“Oh,” said Nina, “I’m so sorry!” 
Bril thought it wise not to dis- 
cover exactly what she was sorry 
about. He said, “No matter. Cus- 
toms differ. I shall eat when I am 
alone.” 

“Now that we understand,” 
said Tanyne, “go ahead. Eat.” 

But they sat there! 

124 



“Oh,” said Nina, “I wish you 
spoke our other language; it 
would be so easy to explain!” 
She leaned forward to him, put 
out her arms, as if she could draw 
meaning itself from the air and 
cast it over him. “Please try to 
understand, Bril. You are very 
mistaken about one thing — we 
honor privacy above almost any- 
thing else.” 

“We don’t mean the same thing 
when we say it,” said Bril. 

“It means aloneness with one- 
self, doesn’t it? It means to do 
things, think or make or just be, 
without intrusion.” 

“Unobserved,” said Bril. 

“So?” replied Wonyne happily, 
throwing out both hands in a 
gesture that said quod erat dem- 
onstrandum. “Go on then — eat! 
We won’t look!” and helped the 
situation not at all. 

“Wonyne’s right,” chuckled the 
father, “but, as usual, a little too 
direct. He means we can’t look, 
Bril. If you want privacy, we 
can’t see you.” 

Angry, reckless, Brill suddenly 
reached to the tray. He snatched 
up a goblet, the one she had indi- 
cated as water, thumbed a cap- 
sule out of his belt, popped it into 
his mouth, drank and swallowed. 
He banged the goblet back on 
the tray and shouted, “Now 
you’ve seen all you’re going to 
see.” 

With an indescribable expres- 
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sion, Nina drifted upward to her 
feet, bent like a dancer and 
touched the tray. It lifted and 
she guided it away across the 
courtyard. 

“All right,” said Wonyne. It 
was precisely as if someone had 
spoken and he had acknowl- 
edged. He lounged out, following 
his mother. 

Vl^HAT had been on her face? 

” Something she could not 
contain; something rising to that 
smooth surface, about to reveal 
outlines, break through . anger? 
Bril hoped so. Insult? He could, 
he supposed, understand that. 
But — laughter? Don’t make it 
laughter, something within him 
pleaded. 

“Bril,” said Tanyne. 

For the second time, he was so 
lost in contemplation of the 
woman that Tanyne’s voice made 
him start. 

“What is it?” 

“If you will tell me what ar- 
rangements you would like for 
eating. I’ll see to it that you get 
them.” 

“You wouldn’t know how,” said 
Brill bluntly. He threw his sharp, 
cold gaze across the room and 
back. “You people don’t build 
walls you can’t see through, doors 
you can close.” 

“Why, no, we don’t.” As always, 
the giant left the insult and took 
only the words. 



I bet you don’t, Bril said si- 
lently, not even for — and a hor- 
rible suspicion began to grow 
within him. “We of Kit Carson 
feel that all human history and 
development are away from the 
animal, toward something higher. 
We are, of course, chained to the 
animal state, but we do what we 
can to eliminate every animal act 
as a public spectacle.” Sternly, he 
" waved a shining gauntlet at the 
great open house. “You have ap- 
parently not reached such an 
idealization. I have seen how you 
eat; doubtless you perform your 
other functions so openly.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Tanyne. “But 
with this — ” he pointed — “it’s 
hardly the same thing.” 

“With what?” 

Tanyne again indicated one of 
the boulderlike objects. He tore 
off a clump of moss — it was real 
moss — and tossed it to the soft 
surface of one of the boulders. 
He reached down and touched 
one of the gray streaks. The moss 
sank into the surface the way a 
pebble will in quicksand, but 
much faster. 

“It will not accept living ani- 
mal matter above a certain level 
of complexity,” he explained, 
“but it instantly absorbs every 
molecule of anything else, not 
only on the surface but for a dis- 
tance above.” 

“And that’s a — a — where 
you — ” 



THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



12S 



Tan nodded and said that that 
was exactly what it was. 

“But — anyone can see you!” 
Tan shrugged and smiled. 
“How? That’s what I meant when 
I said it’s hardly the same thing. 
Of eating, we make a social oc- 
casion. But this — ” he threw an- 
other clump of moss and watched 
it vanish — “just isn’t observed.” 
His sudden laugh rang out and 
again he said, “I wish you’d learn 
the language. Such a thing is so 
easy to express.” 

But Bril was concentrating on 
something else. “I appreciate 
your hospitality,” he said, using 
the phrase stiltedly, “but I’d like 
to be moving on.” He eyed the 
boulder distastefully. “And very 
soon.” 

“As you wish. You have a mes- 
sage for Xanadu. Deliver it, then.” 
“To your Government.” 

“To our Government. I told 
you before, Bril — when you’re 
ready, proceed.” 

“I cannot believe that you 
alone represent this planet! 

“Neither can I,” said Tanyne 
pleasantly. “I don’t. Through me, 
you can speak to forty-one others, 
all Senators.” 

“Is there no other way?” 
Tanyne smiled. “Forty-one 
other ways. Speak to any of the 
others. It amounts to the same 
thing.” 

“And no higher government 
body?” 

126 



npANYNE reached out a long 
arm and plucked a goblet 
from a niche in the moss bank. 

It was chased crystal with a lu- 
minous metallic rim. 

“Finding the highest point of 
the government of Xanadu is like 
finding the highest point on this,” 
he said. He ran a finger around 
the inside of the rim and the 
goblet chimed beautifully. 

“Pretty unstable,” growled Bril. 

Tanyne made it sing again and 
replaced it; whether that was an 
answer or not, Bril could not 
know. 

He snorted, “No wonder the 
boy didn’t know what Govern- 
ment was.” 

“We don’t use the term,” said 
Tanyne. “We don’t need it. There 
are few things here that a citizen 
can’t handle for himself; I wish 
I could show you how few. If 
you’ll live with us a while, I will 
show you.” 

He caught Bril’s eye squarely 
as it returned from another dis- ' 
gusted and apprehensive trip to 
the boulder, and laughed out- 
right. But the kindness in his 
voice as he went on quenched 
Bril’s upsurge of indignant fury, 
and a little question curled up: 

Is he managing me? But there 
wasn’t time to look at it. 

“Can your business wait until 
you know us, Bril? I tell you 
now, there is no centralized Gov- 
ernment here, almost no govern- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ment at all; we of the Senate are 
advisory. I tell you, too, that to 
speak to one Senator is to speak 
to all, and that you may do it 
now, this minute, or a year from 
now — whenever you like. I am 
telling you the truth and you 
may accept it or you may spend 
months, years, traveling this plan- 
et and checking up on me; you’ll 
always come out with the same 
answer.” 

Noncommittally, Bril said, 
“How do I know that what I tell 
you is accurately relayed to the 
others?” 

“It isn’t relayed,” said Tan 
frankly. “We all hear it simulta- 
neously.” 

“Some sort of radio?” 

Tan hesitated, then nodded. 
“Some sort of radio.” 

“I won’t learn your language,” 
Bril said abruptly. “I can’t live 
as you do. If you can accept those 
conditions, I will stay a short 
while.” 

“Accept? We insist!” Tanyne 
bounded cheerfully to the niche 
where the goblet stood and held 
his palm up. A large, opaque 
sheet of a shining white material 
rolled down and stopped. “Draw 
with your finger,” he said. 

“Draw? Draw what?” 

“A place of your own. How 
you would like to live, eat, sleep, 
everything.” 

“I require very little. None of 
us on Kit Carson do.” 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



TTE POINTED the finger of 
his gauntlet like a weapon, 
made a couple of dabs in the 
corner of the screen to test the 
line, and then dashed off a very 
creditable parallelepiped. “Tak- 
ing my height as one unit, I’d 
want this one-and-a-half long, 
one-and-a-quarter high. Slit vents 
at eye level, one at each end, two 
on each side, screened against in- 
sects — ” 

“We have no preying insects,” 
said Tanyne. 

“Screened anyway, and with 
as near an unbreakable mesh as 
you have. Here a hook suitable 
for hanging a garment. Here a 
bed, flat, hard, with firm padding 
as thick as my hand, one-and-one- 
eighth units long, one-third wide. 
All sides under the bed enclosed 
and equipped as a locker, im- 
pregnable, and to which only I 
have the key or combination. 
Here a shelf one-third by one- 
quarter units, one-half unit off 
the floor, suitable for eating from 
a seated posture. 

’’One of — those, if it’s self-con- 
tained and reliable,” he said edg- 
ily, casting a thumb at the boul- 
derlike convenience. “The whole 
structure to be separate from all 
others on high ground and over- 
hung by nothing — no trees, no 
cliffs, with approaches clear and 
visible from all sides; as strong 
as speed permits; and equipped 
with a light I can turn off and a 

127 



door that only I can unlock.” 
“Very well,” said Tanyne eas- 
ily. “Temperature?” 

“The same as this spot now.” 
“Anything else? Music? Pic- 
tures? We have some fine mov- 
ing — ” 

Bril, from the top of his dig- 
nity, snorted his most eloquent 
snort. “Water, if you can manage 
it. As to those other things, this 
is a dwelling, not a pleasure pal- 
ace.” 

“I hope you will be comfortable 
in this — in it,” said Tanyne, with 
barely a trace of sarcasm. 

“It is precisely what I am used 
to,” Bril answered loftily. 

“Come, then.” 

“What?” 

The big man waved him on 
and passed through the arbor. 
Bril, blinking in the late pink 
sunlight, followed him. 

On the gentle slope above the 
house, halfway between it and 
the mountaintop beyond, was a 
meadow of the red grass Bril had 
noticed on his way from the wa- 
terfall. In the center of this mead- 
ow was a crowd of people, bus- 
tling like moths around a light, 
their flimsy, colorful clothes flash- 
ing and gleaming in a thousand 
shades. And in the middle of the 
crowd lay a coffin-shaped object. 

¥>RIL could not believe his 
eyes, then stubbornly would 
not, and at last, as they came 

128 



near, yielded and admitted it to 
himself : this was the structure 
he had just sketched. 

He walked more and more 
slowly as the wonder of it grew 
on him. He watched the people 
— children, even — swarming 
around and over the little build- 
ing, sealing the edge between roof 
and wall with a humming device, 
laying screen on the slit-vents. A 
little girl, barely a toddler, came 
up to him fearlessly and in lis{> 
ing Old Tongue asked for his 
hand, which she clapped to a 
tablet she carried. 

“To make your keys,” ex- 
plained Tanyne, watching the 
child scurry off to a man waiting 
at the door. 

He took the tablet and disap- 
peared inside, and they could see 
him kneel by the bed. A young 
boy overtook them and ran past, 
carrying a sheet of the same ma- 
terial the roof and walls were 
made of. It seemed light, but its 
slightly rough, pale-tan surface 
gave an impression of great 
toughness. As they drew up at 
the door, they saw the boy take 
the material and set it in position 
between the end of the bed and 
the doorway. He aligned it care- 
fully, pressing it against the wall, 
and struck it once with the heel 
of his hand, and there was Bril’s 
required table, level, rigid, and 
that without braces and supports. 

“You seemed to like the looks 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of some of this, anyway.” It was 
Nina, with her tray. She floated 
it to the new table, waved cheer- 
fully and left. 

“With you in a moment,” Tan 
called, adding three singing syl- 
lables in the Xanadu tongue 
which were, Bril concluded, an 
endearment of some kind; they 
certainly sounded like it. Tan 
turned back to him, smiling. 

“Well, Bril, how is it?” 

Bril could only ask, “Who gave 
the orders?” 

“You did,” said Tan, and there 
didn’t seem to be any answer to 
that. 

Already, through the open door, 
he could see the crowd drifting 
away, laughing and singing their 
sweet language to each other. He 
saw a young man scoop up scarlet 
flowers from the pink sward and 
hand them to a smiling girl, and 
unaccountably the scene annoyed 
him. He turned away abruptly 
and went about the walls, thump- 
ing them and peering through the 
vents. Tanyne knelt by the bed, 
his big shoulders bulging as he 
tugged at the locker. It might 
as well have been solid rock. 

“Put your hand there,” he said, 
pointing, and Bril clapped his 
gauntlet to the plate he indicated. 

Sliding panels parted. Bril got 
down and peered inside. It had 
its own light, and he could see 
the buff-colored wall of the struc- 
ture at the back and the heavy 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



filleted partition which formed 
the bed uprights. He touched the 
panel again and the doors slid si- 
lently shut, so tight that he could 
barely see their meeting. 

“The door’s the same,” said 
Tanyne. “No one but you can 
open it. Here’s water. You didn’t 
say where to put it. If this is in- 
convenient. .” 

Vj^HEN Bril put his hand near 
” the spigot, water flowed into 
a catch basin beneath. “No, that 
is satisfactory. They work like 
specialists.” 

“They are,” said Tanyne. 
“Then they have built such a 
strange structure before?” 
“Never.” 

Bril looked at him sharply. 
This ingenuous barbarian surely 
could not be making a fool of him 
by design! No, this must be some 
slip of semantics, some shift in 
meaning over the years which 
separated each of them from the 
common ancestor. He would not 
forget it, but he set it aside for 
future thought. 

“Tanyne,” he asked suddenly, 
“how many are you in Xanadu?” 
“In the district, three hundred. 
On the planet, twelve, almost 
thirteen thousand.” 

“We are one and a half bil- 
lions,” said Bril. “And what is 
your largest city?” 

“City,” said Tanyne, as if 
searching through the files of his 

129 



memory. “Oh — city! We have 
none. There are forty-two dis- 
tricts like this one, some larger, 
some smaller.” 

“Your entire planetary popula- 
tion could be housed in one build- 
ing within one city on Kit Car- 
son. And how many generations 
have your people been here?” 
“Thirty-two, thirty-five, some- 
thing like that.” 

“We settled Kit Carson not 
quite six Earth centuries ago. In 
point of time, then, it would seem 
that yours is the older culture. 
Wouldn’t you be interested in 
how we have been able to accom- 
plish so much more?” 

“Fascinated,” said Tanyne. 
“You have some clever little 
handicrafts here,” Bril mused, 
“and a quite admirable coopera- 
tive ability. You could make a 
formidable thing of this world, 
if you wanted to, and if you had 
the proper guidance.” 

“Oh, could we really?” Tanyne. 
seemed very pleased. 

“I must think,” said Bril som- 
berly. “You are not what I — 
what I had supposed. Perhaps I 
shall stay a little longer than I 
had planned. Perhaps while I am 
learning about your people, you 
in turn could be learning about 
mine.” 

“Delighted,” said Tanyne. 
“Now is there anything else you 
need?” 

“Nothing. You may leave me.” 



TTIS autocratic tone gained him 
only one of the big man’s 
pleasant, open-faced smiles. Ta- 
nyne waved his hand and left. 
Bril heard him calling his wife in 
ringing-baritone notes, and her 
glad answer. He set his mailed 
hand against the door plate and 
it slid shut silently. 

Now what, he asked himself, 
got me to do all that bragging? 
Then the astonishment at the 
people of Xanadu rose up and 
answered the question for him. 
What manner of people are spe- 
cialists at something they have 
never done before? 

He got out his stiff, polished, 
heavy uniform, his gauntlets, his 
boots. They were all wired to- 
gether, power supply in the boots, 
controls and computers in the 
trousers and belt, sensory mechs 
in the tunic, projectors and field 
loci in the gloves. 

He hung the clothes on the 
hook provided and set the alarm 
field for anything larger than a 
mouse any closer than thirty 
meters. He dialed a radiation 
dome to cover his structure and 
exclude all spy beams or radia- 
tion weapons. Then he swung his 
left gauntlet on its cable over to 
the table and went to work on 
one small corner. 

In half an hour, he had found 
a combination of heat and pres- 
sure that would destroy the pale 
brown board, and he sat down on 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the edge of the bed, limp with 
amazement. You could build a 
spaceship with stuff like this. 

Now he had to believe that 
they had it in stock sizes exactly 
to his specifications, which would 
mean warehouses and manufac- 
turing facilities capable of mak- 
ing up those and innumerable 
other sizes; or he had to believe 
that they had machinery capable 
of making what his torches had 
just destroyed, in job lots, right 
now. 

But they didn’t have any in- 
dustrial plant to speak of, and if 
they had warehouses, they had 
them where the Kit Carson robot 
scouts had been unable to detect 
them in their orbiting for the last 
fifty years. 

Slowly he lay down to think. 

ACQUIRE a planet, you 
locate the central govern- 
ment. If it is an autocracy, or- 
ganized tightly up to the peak, 
so much the better; the peak is 
small and you kill it or control it 
and use the organization. If there 
is no government at all, you re- 
cruit the people or you extermi- 
nate them. If there is plant, you 
run it with overseers and make 
the natives work it until you can 
train your own people to it and 
eliminate the natives. If there 
are skills, you learn them or you 
control those who have them. 
All in the book; a rule for every 



eventuality, every possibility. 

But what if, as the robots re- 
ported, there was high technology 
and no plant? Planetwide cultu- 
ral stability and almost no com- 
munications? 

Well, nobody ever heard of 
such a thing, so when the robots 
report it, you send an investiga- 
tor. All he has to find out is how 
they do it. All he has to do is to 
parcel up what is to be kept and 
what eliminated when the time 
comes for an expeditionary force. 

There’s always one clean way 
out, thought Bril, putting his 
hands behind his head and look- 
ing up at the tough ceiling. Item, 
one Earth-normal planet, rich in 
natural resources, sparsely popu- 
lated by innocents. You can al- 
ways simply exterminate them. 

But not before you find out 
how they communicate, how they 
cooperate, and how they specialize 
in skills they never tried before. 
How they manufacture superior 
materials out of thin air in no 
time. 

He had a sudden heady vision 
of Kit Carson equipped as these 
people were, a billion and a half 
universal specialists with some 
heretofore unsuspected method 
of intercommunication, capable 
of building cities, fighting wars, 
with the measureless skill and 
split-second understanding and 
obedience with which this little 
house had been built. 



THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



131 




No, these people must not be 
exterminated. They must be 
used. Kit Carson had to learn 
their tricks. If the tricks were — 
he hoped not! — inherent in Xa- 
nadu and beyond the Carson abil- 
ities, then what would be the next 
best thing? 

Why, a cadre of the Xanadu, 



scattered through the cities and 
armies of Kit Carson, instantly 
obedient, instantly trainable. In- 
struct one and you teach them 
all; each could teach a group of 
Kit Carson’s finest. Production, 
logistics, strategy, tactics — he 
saw it all in a flash. 

Xanadu might be left almost 



132

exactly as is, except for its new 
export — aides de camp. 

Dreams, these are only dreams, 
he told himself sternly. Wait un- 
til you know more. Watch them 
make impregnable hardboard 
and anti-grav tea-trays. 

The thought of the tea-tray 
made his stomach growl. He got 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



up and went to it. The hot food 
steamed, the cold was still frosty 
and firm. He picked, he tasted. 
Then he bit. Then he gobbled. 

Nina, that Nina . 

No, they can’t be exterminated, 
he thought drowsily, not when 
they can produce such a woman. 
In all of Kit Carson, there wasn’t 
a cook like that. 

He lay down again and 
dreamed, and dreamed until he 
fell asleep. 

fT^HEY were completely frank. 

They showed him everything, 
and it apparently never occurred 
to them to ask him why he want- 
ed to know. Asking was strange, 
because they seemed to lack that 
special pride of accomplishment 
one finds in the skilled potter, 
metalworker, electronician, an at- 
titude of “Isn’t it remarkable that 
I can do it!” They gave informa- 
tion accurately but impersonally, 
as if anyone could do it. 

And on Xanadu, anyone could. 

At first, it seemed to Bril to- 
tally disorganized. These attrac- 
tive people in their indecent gar- 
ments came and went, mingling 
play and work and loafing, with- 
out apparent plan. But their play 
would take them through a flow- 
er-garden just where the weeds 
were, and they would take the 
weeds along. There seemed to be 
a group of girls playing jacks 
right outside the place they would 

133 



suddenly be needed to sort some 
seeds. 

Tanyne tried to explain it: 
“Say we have a shortage of some- 
thing — oh, strontium, for exam- 
ple. The shortage itself creates a 
sort of vacuum. People without 
anything special to do feel it; 
they think about strontium. They 
come, they gather it.” 

“But I have seen no mines,” 
Bril said puzzledly. “And what 
about shipping? Suppose the 
shortage is here and the mines in 
another district?” 

“That never happens any more. 
Where there are deposits, of 
course, there are no shortages. 
Where there are none, we find 
other ways, either to use some- 
thing else, or to produce it with- 
out mines.” 

“Transmute it?” 

“Too much trouble. No, we 
breed a fresh-water shellfish with 
a strontium carbonate shell in- 
stead of calcium carbonate. The 
children gather them for us when 
we need it.” 

He saw their clothing industry 
— part shed, part cave, part for- 
est glen. There was a pool there 
where the young people swam, 
and a field where they sunned 
themselves. Between times, they 
went into the shadows and worked 
by a huge vessel where chemicals 
occasionally boiled, turned bright 
green, and then precipitated. The 
black precipitate was raised from 

134 



the bottom of the vessel on 
screens, dumped into forms and 
pressed. 

Just how the presses — little 
more than lids for the forms — 
operated, the Old Tongue couldn’t 
tell him, but in four or five sec- 
onds the precipitate had turned 
into the black stones used in their 
belts, formed and polished, with 
a chemical formula in Old Tongue 
script cut into the back of the 
left buckle. 

“One of our few supersitions,” 
said Tanyne. “It’s the formula 
for the belts — even a primitive 
chemistry could make them. We 
would like to see them copied, 
duplicated all over the Universe. 
They are what we are. Wear 
one, Bril. You would be one of 
us, then.” 

"DRIL snorted in embarrassed 
contempt and went to watch 
two children deftly making up 
the belts, as easily, and with the 
same idle pleasure, as they might 
be making flower necklaces in a 
minute or two. As each was as- 
sembled, the child would strike 
it against his own belt. All the 
colors there are would appear 
each time this happened, in a 
brief, brilliant, cool flare. Then 
the belt, now with a short trim 
of vague tongued light, was 
tossed in a bin. 

Probably the only time Bril 
permitted himself open astonish- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



merit on Xanadu was the first 
time he saw one of the natives 
put on this garment. It was a 
young man, come dripping from 
the pool. He snatched up a belt 
from the bank and clasped it 
around his waist, and immediate- 
ly color and substance flowed up 
and down, a flickering, changing 
collar for him, a moving corus- 
cant kilt. 

“It’s alive, you see,” said Ta- 
nyne. “Rather, it is not non-liv- 
ing matter.” 

He put his fingers under the 
hem of his own kilt and forced 
his fingers up and outward. They 
penetrated the fabric, which flut- 
tered away — untorn. 

“It is not,” he said gravely, 
“altogether material, if you will 
forgive an Old Tongue pun. The 
nearest Old Tongue term for it 
is ‘aura.’ Anyway, it lives, in its 
way. It maintains itself for — oh, 
a year or more. Then dip it in 
lactic acid and it is refreshed 
again. And just one of them 
could activate a million belts or 
a billion. — how many sticks can 
a fire burn?” 

“But why wear such a thing?” 

Tanyne laughed. “Modesty.” 
He laughed again. “A scholar of 
the very old times, on Earth be- 
fore the Nova, passed on to me 
the words of one Rudofsky: 
‘Modesty is not so simple a virtue 
as honesty.’ We wear these be- 
cause they are warm when we 



need warmth, and because they 
conceal some defects some of the 
time — surely all one can ask of 
any human affectation.” 

“They are certainly not mod- 
est,” said Bril stiffly. 

“They express modesty just 
to the extent that they make us 
more pleasant to look at with 
than without them. What more 
public expression of humility 
could you want than that?” 

Bril turned his back on Tanyne 
and the discussion. He under- 
stood Tanyne’s words and ways 
imperfectly to begin with, and 
this kind of talk left him bewil- 
dered, or unreached, or both. 

TTE FOUND out about the 
hardboard. Hanging from 
the limb of a tree was a large vat 
of milky fluid — the paper. Tan 
explained, of a wasp they had 
developed, dissolved in one of 
the nucleic acids which they syn- 
thesized from a native weed. Un- 
der the vat was a flat metal plate 
and a set of movable fences. 
These were arranged in the de- 
sired shape and thickness of the 
finished panel, and then a cock 
was opened and the fluid ran in 
and filled the enclosure. There- 
upon two small children pushed a 
roller by hand across the top of 
the fences. The white lake of 
fluid turned pale brown and so- 
lidified, and that was the hard- 
board. 



THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



135 



Tanyne tried his best to ex- 
plain to Bril about that roller, 
but the Old Tongue joined forces 
with Bril’s technical ignorance 
and made the explanation in- 
comprehensible. The coating of 
the roller was as simple in de- 
sign, and as complex in theory, as 
a transistor, and Bril had to let 
it go at that, as he did with the 
selective analysis of the boulder- 
like “plumbing” and the anti- 
grav food trays (which, he dis- 
covered, had to be guided out- 
bound, but which “homed” on the 
kitchen-area when empty). 

He had less luck, as the days 
went by, in discovering the na- 
ture of the skills of Xanadu. He 
had been quite ready to discard 
his own dream as a fantasy, an 
impossibility — the strange idea 
that what any could do, all could 
do. Tanyne tried to explain; at 
least, he answered every one of 
Bril’s questions. 

These wandering, indolent, 
joyful people could pick up any- 
one’s work at any Stage and carry 
it to any degree. One would pick 
up a flute and play a few notes, 
and others would stroll over, 
some with instruments and some 
without, and soon another instru- 
ment and another would join in, 
until there were fifty or sixty and 
the music was like a passion or 
a storm, or after-love or sleep 
when you think back on it. 

And sometimes the bystanders 

136 



would step forward and take an 
instrument from the hands of 
someone who was tiring, and 
play on with all the rest, pure 
and harmonious; and, no. Tan 
would aver, he didn’t think they’d 
ever played that particular piece 
of music before, those fifty or 
sixty people. 

It always got down to feeling, 
in Tan’s explanations. 

“It’s a feeling you get. The vio- 
lin, now; I’ve heard one, we’ll 
say, but never held one. I watch 
someone play and I understand 
how the notes are made. Then I 
take it and do the same, and as 
I concentrate on making the 
note, and the note that follows, 
it comes to me not only how it 
should sound, but how it should 
feel — to the fingers, the bowing 
arm, the chin and collarbone. 
Out of those feelings comes the 
feeling of how it feels to be mak- 
ing such music. 

“Of course, there are limita- 
tions,” he admitted, “and some 
might do better than others. If 
my fingertips are soft, I can’t play 
as long as another might. If a 
child’s hands are too small for 
the instrument, he’ll have to drop 
an octave or skip a note' But the 
feeling’s there, when we think in 
that certain way. 

“It’s the same with anything 
else we do,” he summed up. “If 
I need something in my house, 
a machine, a device, I won’t use 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



iron where copper is better; it 
wouldn’t ieel right for me. I don’t 
mean feeling the metal with my 
hands; I mean thinking about 
the device and its parts and what 
it’s for. When I think of all the 
things I could make it of, there’s 
only one set of things that feels 
right to me.” 

4CCO,” SAID Bril then. “And 

^ that, plus this — this com- 
petition between the districts, to 
find all elements and raw mate- 
rials in the neighborhood instead 
of sending for them — that’s why 
you have no commerce. Yet you 
say you’re standardized — at any 
rates, you all have the same kind 
of devices, ways of doing things.” 

“We all have* whatever we want 
and we make it ourselves, yes,” 
Tan agreed. 

In the evenings, Bril would 
sit in Tanyne’s house and listen 
to the drift and swirl of conver- 
sation, or the floods of music, 
and wonder; and then he would 
guide his tray back to his cubicle 
and lock the door and eat, and 
brood. He felt at times that he 
was under an attack with wea- 
pons he did not understand, on 
a field which was strange to him. 

He remembered something Ta- 
nyne had said once, casually, 
about men and their devices: 
“Ever since there were human 
beings, there has been conflict be- 
tween Man and his machines. 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



They will run him or he them; 
it’s hard to say which is the less 
disastrous way. But a culture 
which is composed primarily of 
men has to destroy one made 
mostly of machines, or be de- 
stroyed. It was always that way. 
We lost a culture once on Xana- 
du. Didn’t you ever wonder, Bril, 
why there are so few of us here? 
And why almost all of us have 
red hair?” 

Bril had, and had secretly 
blamed the small population on 
the shameless lack of privacy, 
without which no human race 
seems to be able to whip up 
enough interest in itself to breed 
readily. 

“We were billions, once,” said 
Tan surprisingly. “We were wiped 
out. Know how many were left? 
Three!” 

That was a black night for 
Bril, when he realized how piti- 
able were his efforts to learn their 
secret. For if a race were nar- 
rowed to a few, and a mutation 
took place, and it then increased 
again, the new strain could be 
present in all the new genera- 
tions. He might as well, he 
thought, try to wrest from them 
the secret of having red hair. 
That was the night he concluded 
that these people would have to 
go; and it hurt him to think that, 
and he was angry at himself for 
thinking so. That, too, was the 
night of the ridiculous disaster. 

137 



TTE LAY on his bed, grinding 
his teeth in helpless fury. It 
was past noon and he had been 
there since he awoke, trapped by 
his own stupidity, and ridiculous, 
ridiculous. His greatest single pos- 
session — his dignity — was 
stripped from him by his own 
carelessness, by a fiendish and 
unsportsmanlike gadget that — 
His approach alarm hissed and 
he sprang to his feet in an agony 
of embarrassment, in spite of the 
strong opaque walls and the door 
which only he could open. 

It was Tanyne; his friendly 
greeting bugled out and mingled 
with birdsong and the wind. 
“Bril! You there?” 

Bril let him come a little closer 
and then barked through the 
vent, “I’m not coming out.” Ta- 
nyne stopped dead, and even 
Bril himself was surprised by the 
harsh, squeezed sound of his 
voice. 

“But Nina asked for you. She’s 
going to weave today; she thought 
you’d like—” 

“No,” snapped Bril. “Today I 
leave. Tonight, that is. I’ve sum- 
moned my bubble. It will be here 
in two hours. After that, when 
it’s dark, I’m going.” 

“Bril, you can’t. Tomorrow I’ve 
set up a sintering for you; show 
you how we plate — ” 

“No!” 

“Have we offended you, Bril? 
Have I?” 

138 



“No.” Bril’s voice was surly, 
but at least not a shout. 

“What’s happened?” 

Bril didn’t answer. 

Tanyne came closer. Bril’s eyes 
disappeared from the slit. He was 
cowering against the wall, sweat- 
ing. 

Tanyne said, “Something’s hap- 
pened, something’s wrong. I . 
feel it. You know how I feel 
things, my friend, my good friend 
Bril.” 

The very thought made Bril 
stiffen in terror. Did Tanyne 
know? Could he? 

He might, at that. Bril damned 
these people and all their devices, 
their planet and its sun and the 
fates which had brought him 
here. 

“There is nothing in my world 
or in my experience you can’t 
tell me about. You know I’ll un- 
derstand,” Tanyne pleaded. He 
came closer. “Are you ill? I have 
all the skills of the surgeons who 
have lived since the Three. Let 
me in.” 

“No!” It was hardly a word; it 
was an explosion. 

Tanyne fell back a step. “I beg 
your pardon, Bril. I won’t ask 
again. But — tell me. Please tell 
me. I must be able to help you!” 

All Tight, thought Bril, half 
hysterically. I’ll tell you and you 
can laugh your fool red head off. 
It won’t matter once we seed 
your planet with Big Plague. “I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



can’t come out. I’ve ruined my 
clothes.” 

“Bril! What can that matter? 
Here, throw them out; we can fix 
them, no matter what it is.” 

“No!” He could just see what 
would happen with these univer- 
sal talents getting hold of the 
most compact and deadly armory 
this side of the Sumner System. 

“Then wear mine.” Tan put his 
hands to the belt of black stones. 

“I wouldn’t be seen dead in a 
flimsy thing like that. Do you 
think I’m an exhibitionist?” 

Vj^ITH more heat (it wasn’t 
much) than Bril had ever 
seen in him, Tanyne said, “You’ve 
been a lot more conspicuous in 
those winding sheets you’ve been 
wearing than you ever would in 
this.” 

Bril had never thought of that. 
He looked longingly at the bright 
nothing which flowed up and 
down from the belt, and then at 
his own black harness, humped 
up against the wall under its 
hook. He hadn’t been able to 
bear the thought of putting them 
back on since the accident hap- 
pened, and he had not been this 
long without clothes since he’d 
been too young to walk. 

“What happened to your 
clothes, anyway?” Tan asked 
sympathetically. 

Laugh, thought Bril, and Fit 
kill you right now and you’ll 



never have a chance to see your 
race die. “I sat down on the — 
I’ve been using it as a chair; 
there’s only room for one seat in 
here. I must have kicked the 
switch. I didn’t even feel it until 
I got up. The whole back of my 
— ” Angrily he blurted, “Why 
doesn’t that ever happen to you 
people?” 

“Didn’t I tell you?” Tan said, 
passing the news item by as if it 
meant nothing. Well, to him it 
probably was nothing. “The unit 
only accepts non-living matter.” 

“Leave that thing you call 
clothes in front of the door,” Bril 
grunted after a strained silence. 
“Perhaps I’ll try it.” 

Tanyne tossed the belt up 
against the door and strode away, 
singing softly. His voice was so 
big that even his soft singing 
seemed to go on forever. 

But eventually Bril had the 
field to himself, the birdsong and 
the wind. He went to the door 
and away, lifted his seatless 
breeches sadly and folded them 
out of sight under the other things 
on the hook. He looked at the 
door again and' actually whim- 
pered once, very quietly. At last 
he put the gauntlet against the 
doorplate, and the door, never 
designed to open a little way, 
obediently slid wide. He squeaked, 
reached out, caught up the belt, 
scampered back and slapped at 
the plate. 



THE SKILLS OF XANADU

“No one saw,” he told himself 
urgently. 

He pulled the belt around him. 
The buckle parts knew each oth- 
er like a pair of hands. 

first thing he was aware 
of was the warmth. Nothing 
but the belt touched him any- 
where and yet there was a warmth 
on him, soft, safe, like a bird’s 
breast on eggs. A split second 
later, he gasped. 

How could a mind fill so and 
not feel pressure? How could so 
much understanding flood into a 
brain and not break it? 

He understood about the roller 
which treated the hardboard; it 
was a certain way and no other, 
and he could feel the rightness 
of that sole conjecture. 

He understood the ions of the 
mold-press that made the belts, 
and the life-analog he wore as a 
garment. He understood how his 
finger might write on a screen, 
and the vacuum of demand he 
might send out to have this house 
built so, and so, and exactly so; 
and how the natives would hurry 
to fill it. 

He remembered without effort 
Tanyne’s description of the feel 
of playing an instrument, mak- 
ing, building, molding, holding, 
sharing, and how it must be to 
play in a milling crowd beside a 
task, moving randomly and only 
for pleasure, yet taking someone’s 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



place at vat or bench, furrow or 
fishnet, the very second another 
laid down a tool. 

He stood in his own quiet 
flame, in his little coffin-cubicle, 
looking at his hands and knowing 
without question that they would 
build him a model of a city on 
Kit Carson if he liked, or a statue 
of the soul of the Sole Authoriy. 

He knew without question that 
he had the skills of this people, 
and that he could call on any of 
those skills just by concentrating 
on a task until it came to him 
how the right way (for him) 
would feel. He knew without sur- 
prise that these resources tran- 
scended even death; for a man 
could have a skill and then it 
was everyman’s, and if the man 
should die, his skill still lived in 
everyman. 

Just by concentrating — that 
was the key, the keyway, the 
keystone to the nature of this de- 
vice. A device, that was all — 
no mutations, nothing ‘extra-sen- 
sory’ (whatever that meant); 
only a machine like other ma- 
chines. You have a skill, and a 
feeling about it; I have a task. 
Concentration on my task sets up 
a demand for your skill; through 
the living flame you wear, you 
transmit; through mine, I receive. 
Then I perform; and what bias 
I put upon that performance de- 
pends on my capabilities. Should 
I add something to that skill, 

141 



then mine is the higher, the more 
complete; the feeling of it is bet- 
ter, and it is I who will transmit 
next time there is a demand. 

A ND he understood the author- 
ity that lay in this new aura, 
and it came to him then how his 
home planet could be welded into 
a unit such as the Universe had 
never seen. Xanadu had not done 
it, because Xanadu had grown 
randomly with its gift, without 
the preliminary pounding and 
shaping and milling of authority 
and discipline. 

But Kit Carson! Carson with 
all skills and all talents shared 
among all its people, and overall 
and commanding, creating that 
vacuum of need and instant ful- 
filment, the Sole Authority and 
the State. It must be so (even 
though, far down, something in 
him wondered why the State 
kept so much understanding 
away from its people), for with 
this new depth came a solemn 
new dedication to his home and 
all it stood for. 

Trembling, he unbuckled the 
belt and turned back its left 
buckle. Yes, there it was, the for- 
mula for the precipitate. And now 
he understood the pressing proc- 
ess and he had the flame to 
strike into new belts and make 
them live — by the millions, Ta- 
nyne had said, the billions. 

Tanyne had said . why had 

142 



he never said that the garments 
of Xanadu were the source of all 
their wonders and perplexities? 

But had Bril ever asked? 

Hadn’t Tanyne begged him to 
take a garment so he could be 
one with Xanadu? The poor 
earnest idiot, to think he could 
be swayed away from Carson this 
way! Well, then, Tanyne and his 
people would have an offer, too, 
and it would all be even; soon 
they could, if they would, join the 
shining armies of a new Kit Car- 
son. 

From his hanging black suit, a 
chime sounded. Bril laughed and 
gathered up his old harne^ and 
all the fire and shock and paraly- 
sis asleep in its mighty, compact 
weapons. He slapped open the 
door and sprang to the bubble 
which waited outside, and flung 
his old uniform in to lie crumpled 
on the floor, a broken chrysalis. 
Shining and exultant, he leaped 
in after it and the bubble sprang 
away skyward. 

Vj^ITHIN a week after Bril’s 
” return to Kit Carson in the 
Sumner System, the garment had 
been duplicated, and duplicated 
again, and tested. 

Within a month, nearly two 
hundred thousand had been dis- 
tributed, and eighty factories 
were producing round the clock. 

Within a year, the whole plan- 
et, all the millions, were shining 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and unified as never before, mov- 
ing together under their Leader’s 
will like the cells of a hand. 

And then, in shocking unison, 
they all flickered and dimmed, 
every one, so it was time for the 
lactic acid dip which Bril had 
learned of. It was done in panic, 
without test or hesitation; a small 
taste of this luminous subjection 
had created a mighty appetite. 
All was well for a week — 

And then, as the designers in 
Xanadu has planned, all the other 
segments of the black belts joined 
the first meager two in full opera- 
tion. 

A billion and a half human 
souls, who had been given the 
techniques of music and the 
graphic arts, and the theory of 
technology, now had the others: 
philosophy and logic and love; 
sympathy, empathy, forbearance, 
unity in the idea of their species 
rather than in their obedience; 
membership in harmony with all 
life everywhere. 

A people with such feelings 
and their derived skills cannot be 
slaves. As the light burst upon 
fhem, there was only one con- 
ccail ration possible to each of 
them — to be free, and the ac- 
complished feeling of being free. 
As (>ach found it, he was an ex- 
pert in freedom, and expert suc- 
c<“(‘ded expert, transcended ex- 
p('it, until (in a moment) a bil- 
lion and a half human souls had 

THE SKILLS OF XANADU 



no greater skill than the talent 
of freedom. 

So Kit Carson, as a culture, 
ceased to exist, and something 
new started there and spread 
through the stars nearby. 

And because Bril knew what 
a Senator was and wanted to be 
one, he became one. 

TN EACH other’s arms, Tanyne 
and Nina were singing softly, 
when the goblet in the mossy 
niche chimed. 

“Here comes another one,” 
said Wonyne, crouched at their 
feet. “I wonder what will make 
him beg, borrow or steal a belt.” 
“Doesn’t matter,” said Tanyne, 
stretching luxuriously, “as long as 
he gets it. Which one is he. Wo — 
that noisy mechanism on the 
other side of the small moon?” 
“No,” said Wonyne. “That one’s 
still sitting there squalling and 
thinking we don’t know it’s there. 
No, this is the force-field that’s 
been hovering over Fleetwing 
District for the last two years.” 
Tanyne laughed. “That’ll make 
conquest number eighteen for us.” 
“Nineteen,” corrected Nina 
dreamily. “I remember because 
eighteen was the one that just 
left and seventeen was that funny 
little Bril from the Sumner Sys- 
tem. Tan, for a time that little 
man loved me.” But that was a 
small thing and did not matter.

human mathematician to prove 
this or even understand it. 

‘“Did you know that Chinese 
is spoken by more people than 
anybody else?’ This implies that 
beings other than people speak 
Chinese. The only comfort I can 
find in the remark is that we out- 
number them. 

“ ‘While you’re out in the kitch- 
en, dear, the uncoffee should be 
plugged.’ I don’t feel that this 
statement requires comment. 
Anyone can see that the washee- 
pots need coughing because they 
are full of uncoffee that hasn’t 
been plugged. 

“I don’t know whether or not 
this is relevant, but we have a 
ten-month-old daughter who 
wakes up every night arid chuck- 
les delightedly in the dark at 
something we can’t see or hear. 
At any rate, my wife claims she 
can’t see or hear it. I know I 
can’t.” 

There may be more here than 
meets the eye, but what meets 
the eye is certainly disturbing 
enough. That overwrought iron, 
for example — if metal can get 
fatigued and X-rays can detect 
it, what makes you think your 
wife can’t sense nervousness in 
at least iron? If she is able to, 
what else can she sense? 

Now maybe you see why I 
don’t share your comfort in the 
fact that we outnumber the be- 

144 



ings who speak Chinese. One ma- 
chine gun, remember, could have 
won any war before 1863 or so. 
And have you noticed that she 
has not mentioned any other lan- 
guage? 

However, you’re safe. What- 
ever happens, your wife can prob- 
ably protect you. If not, your 
daughter can — she seems on the 
best of terms with the thing or 
things in the dark, and half her 
loyalty presumably is, if not to 
humanity, then to her dad. 

But what of the rest of us? 
Those ‘platations from Quoto’ 
sound formidable enough to up- 
set anyone who knows military 
organization. This uneasiness is 
not lulled by the least baffling 
communication from the alien 
respiondents ; 

“Of time some courses I can’t 
see my face in front of my hand 
and some people don’t think I 
think like a people. 

“But I do. I just go bored from 
without and say things brightly 
through a mirror dark-wards. It 
is only a profound disassociation 
of intent and meaning. Any hu- 
man can do.” 

Very homy-sounding . but at 
the bottom of the letter is a pink 
blur, 2.1508 inches across, that 
looks like a vast fingerprint. It 
isn’t, though. I checked with a 
friend who knows fingerprinting. 

It’s the mark of a bare heel.

VIKING ROCKET #10 



N OW at last the whole exciting story of the fab- 
ulous Viking Rockets can be told. And what a story 
it is! Twelve of these huge liquid-fueled monsters, 
carrying “pay loads” of instruments, cameras and re- 
cording devices, have soared up into space and sent 
us back much previous knowledge of the ionosphere- 
data which has brought us years closer to actual space 
travel than most of us realize. One Viking reached 
the amazing altitude of 168 miles— and even took pic- 
tures of the earth from that height! 

Facts As Exciting As Fiction! 

In THE VIKING ROCKET STORY, Milton W. 
Rosen of the Naval Research Laboratory, gives us a 
dramatic first-hand account of these sensational 
flights. He describes the Herculean labors, heart- 
rending set-backs, nerve-fraying suspense and final 
triumphs of the entire Viking project. Here are facts 
as exciting as any fiction you ever read. Illustrated 
with many diagrams and 32 pages of dramatic pho- 
tographs. Regular publisher’s edition sells for $3.75. 
But you can have this book and any TWO of the other 
books shown on the other side of this page— THRE^ 
BOOKS, worth up to $10.75— for only $1 as a ne’ 
member of the Science-Fiction Book Club.
