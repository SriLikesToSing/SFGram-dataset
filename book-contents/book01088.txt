THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature's laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands ofmenand woraenwho pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

WAY 


OUT 



A LOT of things combined 
— our cover, our new 
Poul Anderson serial and 
even the time of year — make us 
take a look at the sky. Anderson 
has the remarkable capacity to 
think like a scientist and write 
like a poet. What interests him 
he can manage to translate so as 
to evoke interest in the reader; 
and what interests him in The 
Day Alter Doomsday is the in- 


credible size of our galactic lens. 

Start with a single statistic: 
There are some 80,000,000,000 
stars in our galaxy alone. 

If Earths almost three billion 
people owned the stars and 
divided them share-and-share- 
alike, each man, woman and child 
would possess nearly thirty. We 
can see, under the best conditions, 
some two or three thousand of 
them with the naked eye; for 


5 


every star we can see, more than 
twenty million are there but in- 
visible — by reason of distance, by 
reason of intervening opaque 
clouds of gas or by reason of sheer 
numbers, so that they are lost in 
the general brightness we call the 
Milky Way. 

With all those nearby com- 
panions (we haven’t even touched 
on the billions of billions in the 
other galaxies, farther away), it 
seems a sure bet that we have 
neighbors in the universe. Almost 
certainly many of these stars 
have planets; we have hope that 
at least a few of these planets may 
harbor life . intelligent life, life 
of something resembling our own 
kind. And even a “few” might 
mean many thousands. 

A LL in all, the inhabited, civil- 
ized worlds in our own gal- 
axy may well be numbered in the 
thousands or millions. 

So why, one asks at once, 
haven’t any of the neighbors 
dropped in for a call? 

Well, perhaps they have. The 
Earth is old, and organized 
record-keeping goes back only a 
few moments of its long day. 

Quite a sizable settlement of 
Sirians or Arcturans could have 
been built on North America be- 
tween glaciations, not so very 
many thousand years ago. There 
wasn’t a human eye on the conti- 
nent to see it, and its physical 


traces might easily have been 
buried under the debris of the Ice * 
Age. The UFOlogists haven’t 
much doubt that we are being 
visited even now, for that mat- 
ter. 

Yet we’re easy enough to over- 
look. Earth is, after all, only one 
tiny planet circling one insignifi- 
cant sun far out on one of the 
gassy, pinwheel arms of the gal- 
axy. Sol is itself an outpost. Were 
we in the dense star clusters 
around the center we might have 
had visitors every second Sun- 
day afternoon. 

The Day After Doomsday 
gives us a view of what our galaxy 
may be like, from the point of 
view of the races who live in it: 
countless worlds, more interested 
in their own immediate problems 
than in fruitless wanderings into 
remote skies. There isn’t any rea- 
son why they should exert them- 
selves to visit Earth, after all. 
And even if we assume them as 
curious as the Polynesians or as 
trade-hungry as a Marco Polo, 
exploration between stars is a 
slow, tedious task. The distances 
are not merely linear. It is only 
some six-hundred-odd light-years 
from here to Rigel; but the vol- 
ume of space a Rigellian would 
have to survey to stand an even 
chance of running into Earth 
amounts to half a billion cubic 
light-years, encompassing many 
thousands of stars. From the 


6 


GALAXY 


vicinity of Rigel, indeed, hardly 
any of the stars in our sky are 
visible at all to the eye. Our own 
sun is at best a telescopic object, 
and even Sirius is no longer with- 
in the capabilities of the unaided 
eye. 

And yet Rigel is a near neigh- 
bor! 

There’s plenty of room in our 
galaxy for many races, no doubt 
about it. In all that space, the 
vainest human peacock can hard- 
ly imagine himself to be unique. 

So, as Anderson says, we’re 
in all likelihood not alone. We 
are merely out of touch . 

/'''LOSER to home, by the way, 
this is a good season for 
planet-watching. 

Of the five bright planets 
Saturn is one of the more difficult 
to spot by accident. Hanging in 
the same part of the sky for years 
on end, it doesn’t betray its 
presence — as the faster, closer-to- 
the-sun planets do — by popping 
from constellation to constella- 
tion. It moves, all right. But it 
moves slowly. 

For the past three and a half 
years Saturn has been in the con- 
stellation Sagittarius. About a 
year ago it was joined there by 
Jupiter himself. Slowly as Jupiter 
rolls, he still overtakes Saturn; 
Jupiter is catching up and in an- 
other few months will pass. 

Meanwhile the presence of 


these two bright objects in the 
same part of the sky makes it easy 
to locate them. There aren’t any 
bright stars anywhere near them. 
If you look to the south and west, 
not long after dark, not very high 
in the sky, you’ll have no trouble 
picking them out. The brighter of 
the two is Jupiter, hugest of plan- 
ets, monarch of more than a 
dozen moons. The less bright, but 
still brighter than any star nearby, 
is ringed Saturn, a few degrees to 
Jupiter’s west. 

Give them a few more months 
and Saturn will have moved over 
into the next constellation, Capri- 
cornus, Jupiter close behind. 
Around February they will almost 
seem to touch. Meanwhile the 
faster planets — Venus and Mars 
— will have skipped through Leo, 
Virgo, Libra and Scorpius to 
catch up with the slow giants. In 
February all four of them will be 
in the same part of the sky. A bril- 
liant spectacle . but, unfortun- 
ately, not for us Earthmen to see. 

The trouble is that a still 
brighter object will be in the same 
point on the ecliptic — namely the 
sun itself. It will take a spaceship 
to see this particular four-planet 
conjunction . 

So don’t wait till February. If 
you want a good look at, at least, 
Jupiter and Saturn, your chance 
is now.

^"”1 K540, the 27th son of two 
very ordinary white lab- 
oratory rats, surveyed his 

world. 

He was no more able than any 
other rat to possess articulate 
speech, or to use his paws as 
hands. All he had was a brain 
which, relative to its size, was 
superior to any rat’s that had 
hitherto appeared on Earth. It 
was enough. 

In the first week of gestation 
his embryo had been removed to 
a more suitable receptacle than 
the maternal womb, and his 
brain had been stimulated with 
orthedrin, maxiton and glutamic

acid — they were the prescription 
that made him king of his world! 


s mgr 


acid. It had been continuously 
irrigated with blood. One hemi- 
sphere had been activated far in 
excess of the other, since previ- 
ous experiments had shown that 
increased lack of symmetry be- 
tween the hemispheres produced 
superior mentality. The end-re- 
sult was an enormous increase in 
brain-cells in both hemispheres. 
His brain showed also a marked 
increase in cholinesterase over 
that of other rats. 

SK540, in other words, was a 
super-rat. 

The same processes had been 
applied to all his brothers and 
sisters. Most of them had died.

OH, RATS! 


69 


The few who did not, failed to 
show the desired results, or 
showed them in so lopsided and 
partial a manner that it was 
necessary to destroy them. 

All of this, of course had been 
mere preparation and experi- 
mentation with a view to later 
developments in human subjects. 
What SK540’s gods had not an- 
ticipated was that they would 
produce a creature mentally the 
superior, not only of his fellow- 
rats, but also, in some respects, 
of themselves. 

He was a super-rat: but he 
was still a rat. His world of 
dreams and aspirations was not 
human, but murine. 

What would you do if you 
were a brilliant, moody young 
super-rat, caged in a laboratory? 

SK540 did it. 

What human beings desired 
was health, freedom, wealth, love, 
and power. So did SK540. But 
to him health was taken for 
granted; freedom was freedom 
from cages, traps, cats, and dogs; 
wealth meant shelter from cold 
and rain and plenty to eat; love 
meant a constant supply of avail- 
able females. 

But power! It was in his long- 
ing for power that he most re- 
vealingly displayed his status as 
super-rat. 

Therefore, once he had 
learned how to open his cage, 
he was carefully selective of the 


companions — actually, the 
followers — whom he would 
release to join his midnight 
hegira from the laboratory. Only 
the meekest and most subser- 
vient of the males — intelligent 
but not too intelligent — and 
the most desirable and amiable 
of the females were invited. 

Once free of the cages, SK540 
had no difficulty in leading his 
troop out of the building. The 
door of the laboratory was 
locked, but a window was 
slightly open from the top. Rats 
can climb up or down. 

Like a silver ribbon they 
flowed along the dark street, 
SK540, looking exactly like all 
the rest, at their head. Only one 
person in the deserted streets 
seems to have noticed them, and 
he did not understand the nature 
of the phenomenon. 

V^OUNG Mr. and Mrs. Philip 
Vinson started housekeep- 
ing in what had once been a 
mansion. It was now a rundown 
eyesore. 

It had belonged to Norah 
Vinson’s great-aunt Martha, who 
had left it to her in her will. The 
estate was in litigation, but the 
executor had permitted the Vin- 
sons to settle down in the house, 
though they weren’t allowed yet 
to sell it. It had no modern con- 
veniences, and was full of rooms 
they couldn’t use and heavy old- 

GALAXY 


fashioned furniture; but it was 
solidly built and near the labora- 
tory where he worked as a tech- 
nician, and they could live rent- 
free until they could sell the 
house and use the money to buy 
a real home. 

“Something funny happened 
in the lab last night,” Philip re- 
ported, watching Norah struggle 
with dinner on the massive 
coal-stove. “Somebody broke in 
and stole about half our experi- 
mental animals. And they got our 
pride and joy.” 

“The famous SK540?” Norah 
asked. 

“The same. Actually, it wasn’t 
a break-in. It must have been an 
inside job. The cages were open 
but there were no signs of break- 
ing and entering. We’re all under 
suspicion till they find out who- 
dunit.” 

Norah looked alarmed. 

“You too? What on earth 
would anybody want with a lot 
of laboratory rats? They aren’t 
worth anything, are they — 
financially, I mean?” 

“Not a cent. That’s why I’m 
sure one of the clean-up kids 
must have done it. Probably 
wanted them for pets. They’re 
all tame, of course, not like 
wild rats — though they can bite 
like wild rats if they want to. 
Some of the ones missing are 
treated, and some are controls. 
It would just be a nuisance if 

OH, RATS! 



they hadn’t taken SK540. Now 
they’ve got to find him, or do 
about five years’ work over again, 
without any assurance of as great 
a success. To say nothing of let- 
ting our super-rat loose on the 
world.” 

“What on earth could, even a 
super-rat do that would matter 
— to human beings, I mean?” 

“Nobody knows. Maybe that’s 
what we’re going to find out.” 

f T , HAT night Norah woke sud- 
J denly with a loud scream. 
Philip got the gas lighted — 
there was no electricity in the 
old house — and held her shak- 
ing body in his arms. She found 
her breath at last long enough 
to sob: “It was a rat! A rat ran 
right over my face!” 

“You’re dreaming, darling. It’s 
because I told you about the 
theft at the lab. There couldn’t 
be rats in this place. It’s too 
solidly built, from the basement 
up.” 

He finally got her to sleep 
again, but he lay awake for a 
long time, listening. Nothing 
happened. 

Rats can’t talk, but they can 
communicate. About the time 
Norah Vinson dropped off after 
her frightened wakening, SK540 
was confronting a culprit. The 
culprit was one of the liberated 
males. His beady eyes tried to 
gaze into the implacable ones of 


70 


71 


SK540, but his tail twitched 
nervously and if he bared his 
teeth it was more in terror than 
in fight. They all knew that strict 
orders had been given not to dis- 
turb the humans in the house 
until SK540 had all his prepara- 
tions made. 

A little more of that silent 
communication, and the rat who 
had run over Nor ah’s face knew 
he had only two choices — - have 
his throat slit or get out. He got. 

“What do you know?” Philip 
said that evening. “One of our 
rats came back.” 

“By itself?” 

“Yeah. I never heard of such 
a thing. It was one of the ex- 
perimental ones, so it was 
smarter than most, though not 
such an awful lot. I never heard 
of a rat with homing instinct 
before. But when we opened up 
this morning, there he was, sitting 
in his cage, ready for breakfast.” 
“Speaking of breakfast, I 
thought I asked you to buy a 
big box of oatmeal on your way 
home yesterday. It’s about the 
only thing in the way of cereal 
I can manage on that old stove.” 
“I did buy it. Don’t you re- 
member? I left it in the kitchen.” 
“Well, it wasn’t there this 
morning. All I know is that 
you’re going to have nothing but 
toast and coffee tomorrow. We 
seem to be out of eggs, too. And 
bacon. And I thought we had half 


a pound left of that cheese, but 
that’s gone too.” 

“Good Lord, Norah, if you’ve 
got that much marketing to do, 
can’t you do it yourself?” 

“Sure, if you leave the car. I’m 
not going to walk all that way 
and back.” 

So of course Philip did do the 
shopping the next day. Besides, 
Norah had just remembered she 
had a date at the hairdresser’s. 

WW7HEN he got home her hair 
” was still uncurled and she 
was in hysterics. One of the 
many amenities great-aunt 
Martha’s house lacked was a 
telephone; anyway, Norah 
couldn’t have been coherent over 
one. She cast herself, shuddering 
and crying, into Philip’s arms, 
and it was a long time before he 
got her soothed enough for her 
to gasp: “Philip! They wouldn’t 
let me out!” 

“They? Who? What do you 
mean?” 

“The — the rats! The white 
rats. They- made a ring around 
me at the front door so I couldn’t 
open it. I ran to the back and 
they beat me there and did the 
same thing. I even tried the 
windows but it was no use. And 
their teeth — they all — I guess 
I went to pieces. I started throw- 
ing things at them and they just 
dodged. I yelled for help but 
there’s nobody near enough to 


72 


GALAXY 


hear. Then I gave up and ran 
in our bedroom and slammed the 
door on them, but they left 
guards outside. I heard them 
squeaking till you drove up, then 
I heard them run away.” 

Philip stared at her, scared to 
death. His wife had lost her 
mind. 

“Now, now, sweetheart,” he 
said soothingly, “let’s get this 
straight. They fired a lab boy 
today. They found four of our 
rats in his home. He told some 
idiotic story of having ‘found’ 
them, with the others missing, 
running loose on the street that 
night, but of course he stole them. 
He must have sold the rest of 
them to other kids; they’re work- 
ing on that now.” 

Norah blew her nose and 
wiped her eyes. She had regained 
her usual calm. 

“Philip Vinson,” she said cold- 
ly, “are you accusing me of lying, 
or just of being crazy? I’m 
neither. I saw and heard those 
rats. They’re here now. What’s 
more, I guess I know where that 
oatmeal went, and the eggs and 
bacon too, and the cheese. I’m 
— I’m a hostage! 

“I don’t suppose,” she added 
sarcastically, “that your SK540 
was one of the ones they found 
in the boy’s home?” 

“No, it wasn’t,” he acknowl- 
edged uneasily. A nasty little icy 
trickle stole down his spine. “All 


right, Norah, I give in. You take 
the poker and I’ll take the ham- 
mer, and we’ll search this house 
from cellar to attic.” 

“You won’t find them,” said 
Norah bitterly. “SK540’s too 
smart. They’ll stay inside the 
walls and keep quiet.” 

“Then we’ll find the holes they 
went through and rout them out.” 
They didn’t, of course. There 
wasn’t a sign of a rathole, or of 
a rat. 

They got through dinner and 
the evening somehow. Norah put 
all the food not in cans inside 
the old-fashioned icebox which 
took the place of a refrigerator. 
Philip thought he was too dis- 
turbed to be able to sleep, but 
he did, and Norah, exhausted, 
was asleep as soon as her head 
touched the pillow. 

His last doubt of his wife’s 
sanity vanished when, the next 
morning, they found the icebox 
door open and half the food 
gone. 

UnHHAT settles it!” Philip 
announced. “Come on, 
Norah, put your coat on. You’re 
coming with me to the lab and 
we’ll report what’s happened. 
They’ll find those creatures if 
they have to tear the house apart 
to do it. That boy must have 
been telling the truth.” 

“You couldn’t keep me away,” 
Norah responded. “I’ll never 


OH, RATS! 


73 


spend another minute alone in 
this house while those dreadful 
things are in it.” 

But of course when they got 
to the front door, there they 
were, circling them, their teeth 
bared. The same with the back 
door and all the first floor 
windows. 

“That’s SK540 all right, lead- 
ing them,” Philip whispered 
through clenched jaws. He could 
smash them all, he supposed, in 
time, with what weapons he had. 
But he worked in the laboratory. 
He knew their value to science, 
especially SK540’s. 

Rats couldn’t talk, he knew, 
and they couldn’t understand hu- 
man speech. Nevertheless, some 
kind of communication might 
establish itself. SK540’s eyes 
were too intelligent not to be- 
lieve that he was getting the gist 
of talk directed to him. 

“This is utterly ridiculous,” 
Philip grated. “If you won’t let 
us out, how can we keep bringing 
food into the house for you? 
We’ll all starve, you and we 
together.” 

He could have sworn SK540 
was considering. But he guessed 
the implicit answer. Let either 
one of them out, now they knew 
the rats were there, and men 
from the laboratory would come 
quickly and overwhelm and 
carry off the besiegers. It was a 
true impasse. 


“Philip,” Norah reminded him, 
“if you don’t go to work, they 
know we haven’t a phone, and 
somebody will be here pretty 
soon to find out if anything’s 
wrong.” 

But that wouldn’t help, Philip 
reflected gloomily; they’d let 
anyone in, and keep him there. 

And he thought to himself, and 
was careful not to say it aloud: 
rats are rats. Even if they are 
25th generation laboratory-born. 
When the other food was gone 
there would be human meat. 

He did not want to look at 
them any more. He took Norah’s 
arm and turned away into their 
bedroom. 

They stayed there all day, too 
upset to think of eating, talking 
and talking to no conclusion. As 
dusk came on they did not light 
the gas. Exhausted, they lay 
down on the bed without un- 
dressing. 

After a while there was a quiet 
scratching at the door. 

“Don’t let them in!” Norah 
whispered. Her teeth were chat- 
tering. 

“I must, dear,” he whispered 
back. “It isn’t ‘them,’ I’m sure of 
it — it’s just SK540 himself. I’ve 
been expecting him. We’ve got 
to reach some kind of under- 
standing.” 

“With a rat?” 

“With a super-rat. We have no 
choice.”

GALAXY 



Philip was right. SK540 alone 
stood there and sidled in as the 
door closed solidly again behind 
him. 

How could one communicate 
with a rat? Philip could think of 
no way except to pick him up, 
place him where they were face 
to face, and talk. 

“Are your — followers out- 
side?” he asked. 

A rodent’s face can have no 
expression, but Philip caught a 
glance of contempt in the beady 
eyes. The slaves were doubtless 
bedded down in their hideaway, 
with strict orders to stay there 
and keep quiet. 

“You know,” Philip Vinson 
went on, “I could kill you, very 
easily.” The words would mean 
nothing to SK540; the tone 
might. He watched the beady 
eyes; there was nothing in them 
but intelligent attention, no 
flicker of fear. 

“Or I could tie you up and 
take you to the laboratory and 
let them decide whether to keep 
you or kill you. We are all much 
bigger and stronger than you. 
Without your army you can’t in- 
timidate us.” 

There was, of course, no 
answer. But SK540 did a start- 
ling and touching thing. He 
reached out one front paw, as if 
in appeal. 

Norah caught her breath in 
astonishment. 


64TTE — he just wants to be 
free,” she said in a 
choked whisper. 

“You mean you’re not afraid 
of him any more?” 

“You said yourself he couldn’t 
intimidate us without his army.” 
Philip thought a minute. Then 
he said slowly: 

“I wonder if we had the right 
to do this to him in the first 
place. He would have been an 
ordinary laboratory rat, mindless 
and contented; we’ve made him 
into a neurotic alien in his 
world.” 

“You’re not responsible, dar- 
ling; you’re a technician, not a 
biochemist.” 

“I share the responsibility. We 
all do.” 

“So what? The fact remains 
that it was done, and here he is 
— and here we are.” 

The doorbell rang. 

Philip and Norah exchanged 
glances. SK540 watched them. 

“It’s probably Kelly, from the 
lab,” Philip said, “trying to find 
out why I wasn’t there today. It’s 
just about quitting time, and he 
lives nearest us.” 

Norah astonished him. She 
picked up SK540 from the bed- 
side table where Philip had 
placed him, and hid him under 
her pillow. 

“Get rid of whoever it is,” she 
said defensively. Philip stared for 
an instant, then walked briskly 


r 

downstairs. He was back in a 
few minutes. 

“It was Kelly, all right,” he 
told her. “I said you were sick 
and I couldn’t leave you to 
phone. I said I’d be there tomor- 
row. Now what?” 

SK540’s white whiskers 
emerged from under the pillow, 
and he jumped over to the table 
again. Norah’s cheeks were pink. 

‘When it came to the point, I 
just couldn’t,” she explained 
shamefacedly. “I suddenly real- 
ized that he’s a person. I couldn’t 
let him be taken back to prison.” 
“Aren’t you frightened any 
more?” 

‘Not of him.” She faced the 
super-rat squarely. “Look,” she 
said, “if we take care of you, will 
you get rid of that gang of yours, 
so we can be free too?” 

“That’s nonsense, Norah,” 
Philip objected. “He can’t pos- 
sibly understand you.” 

“Dogs and cats learn to under- 
stand enough, and he’s smarter 
than any dog or cat that ever 
lived.” 

“But — ” 

The words froze on his lips. 
SK540 had jumped to the floor 
and run to the door. There he 
stood and looked back at them, 
his tail twitching. 

“He wants us to follow him,” 
Norah murmured. 

There was no sign of a hole 
in the back wall of the disused 


pantry. But behind it they could 
hear squeaks and rustlings. 

SK540 scratched delicately at 
almost invisible cracks. A section 
of the wall, two by four inches, 
fell out on the floor. 

“So that’s where some of the 
oatmeal went,” Norah com- 
mented. “Made into paste.” 

“Sh!” 

SK540 vanished through the 
hole. They waited, listening to 
incomprehensible sounds. Out- 
side it had grown dark. 

f T , HEN the leader emerged and 
stood to one side of the 
long line that pattered through 
the hole. The two humans stared, 
fascinated, as the line made 
straight for the back door and 
under it. SK540 stayed where 
he was. 

‘Will they go back to the 
lab?” Norah asked. 

Philip shrugged. 

“It doesn’t matter. Some of 
them may ... I feel like a 
traitor.” 

“I don’t. I feel like one of 
those people who hid escaped 
war prisoners in Europe.” 

When the rats were all gone, 
they turned to SK540. But with- 
out a glance at them he re- 
entered the hiding-place. In a 
minute he returned, herding two 
white rats before him. He stood 
still, obviously expectant 

Philip squatted on his heels.

OH, RATS!

He picked up the two refugees 
and looked them over. 

“Both females,” he announced 
briefly. “And both pregnant.” 

“Is he the father?” 

“Who else? He’d see to that.” 
“And will they inherit his — 
his — ” 

“His ‘super-ratism’? That’s the 
whole point. That’s the object of 
the entire experiment. They were 
going to try it soon.” 

The three white rats had 
scarcely moved. The two 
mothers-to-be had apparently 
fallen asleep. Only SK540 stood 
quietly eying the humans. When 
they left him to find a place 
where they could talk in private 
he did not follow them. 

“It comes down to this,” Philip 
said at the end of half an hour’s 
fruitless discussion. ‘We prom- 
ised him, or as good as. He be- 
lieved us and trusted us. 

“But if we keep to our promise 
we’re really traitors — to the 
human race.” 

“You mean, if the offspring 
should inherit his brain-power, 
they might overrun us all?” 

“Not might. Would.” 

“So — ” 

“So it’s an insoluble problem, 
on our terms. We have to think 
of this as a war, and of them as 
our enemies. What is our word 
of honor to a rat?” 

“But to a super-rat — to 
SK540 — ” 


As if called, SK540 appeared. 

Had he been listening? Had 
he understood? Neither of them 
dared to voice the question aloud 
in his presence. 

“Later,” Philip murmured. 

“We must eat,” said Norah. 
“Let’s see what’s left in the way 
of food.” 

PWERYTHING tasted flat; 

they weren’t very hungry 
after all. There was enough left 
over to feed the three rats. But 
they had evidently helped them- 
selves earlier; they left the scraps 
untasted. 

Neither of the humans guessed 
what else had vanished from the 
pantry shelves — what, when he 
had heard enough, SK540 had 
slipped away and sprinkled on 
the remaining contents of the ice- 
box, wherever the white powder 
would not show. 

They did not know until it 
was too late — until both of 
them lay writhing in their last 
spasms on their bedroom floor. 

By the time the house was 
broken into and their bodies 
found, SK540 and his two wives 
were far away, and safe. 

And this, children, is the true 
account, handed down by tradi- 
tion from the days of our great 
Founder, of how the human race 
ceased to exist and we took over 
the world.

DRAGONS AND HOT-AIR BALLOONS 

T HIS section owes its exis- 
tence to a letter I recently 
came across while sorting 
out old papers. It came to me 
from China fourteen years ago 
(and a date stamp shows that I 
answered it then.) The letter also 
bears the notation “check Konrad 
Kyeser,” but because of a move 
from Washington, D. C., to New 
Jersey which took place soon 
after I never got around to that 
. until now. 

The letter was written by a

Russian by the name of G. Lari- 
kov. By way of introduction he 
told me that he was a graduate of 
the Imperial Russian Artillery 
School and that he fled Russia 
after the revolution and made his 
home in China. There he became 
a civilian employee of the Chinese 
Ordnance Department during the 
Second World War. After this 
introduction G. Larikov pro- 
ceeded to the reason for writing 
his letter: 

“During my stay in Szechwan 
Province during the first half of 
the recent war,” he wrote, “I lived 
for several years in a deep valley, 
something like your canyons, 
where our arsenal was located for 
protection against Japanese 
bombers. Soon after our arrival 
in that valley the guards started 
to send reports that from time 
to time mysterious lights ap- 
peared floating far above our 
arsenal. Our men were greatly 
alarmed and immediately decided 
that it was some kind of Japanese 
deviltry. I tried to reassure them 
that those lights, after all, did not 
cause us any harm. But they also 
reported the story to the local 
Chinese police and insisted on a 
thorough investigation. At long 
last it was found that the farmers 
who lived in the mountains 
around our valley had the custom 
of sending into the night air paper 
balloons with small oil lamps at- 
tached to them when somebody 


was sick or when they wished to 
send a message to their dead an- 
cestors. We have found later that 
this custom, like all Chinese cus- 
toms, is very old, dating back not 
hundreds but thousands of years 
and so well forgotten in other, 
less remote, parts of China that 
even very few Chinese ever heard 
of it.” 

Considering that mountainous 
Szechwan is a remote place, 
where one would hardly expect 
the farmers to construct hot-air 
ballons of the Montgolfier type 
as a pastime, the anxiety of the 
guards and the surprise of their 
superiors both become under- 
standable. 

But the fact is that the farmers 
did. And that raises the inevitable 
question of how they learned it 
and from whom. (That the cus- 
tom is “thousands of years old” is 
a statement that can safely be 
disregarded. The Chinese were in 
the habit of claiming every one of 
their institutions to be thousands 
of years old.) My correspondent 
did not try to answer that ques- 
tion, but said that possibly “in 
former .years, some missionaries 
brought the idea of hot-air bal- 
loons from China to Europe, 
where it was adapted by the 
brothers Montgolfier for their 
flying experiments.” 

I probably answered at the 
time that I felt sure that mission- 
aries — more specifically French 


80 


GALAXY 


missionaries — were involved, but 
that the idea of the hot-air bal- 
loon probably traveled the other 
way. So that the “thousand-year- 
old” custom would perhaps date 
back to around the year 1800. 

M Y reasons for passing judg- 
ment like that were the fol- 
lowing: If, at a time when noth- 
ing in Europe took to the air but 
birds and insects, hot-air balloons 
from China had become known 
via a returning missionary, that 
fact would have been written up 
at great length. Nor would their 
Chinese origin have been con- 
cealed in any way. Just at that 
time Europeans were very much 
interested in things Chinese. On 
the other hand, the Montgolfiers’ 
hot-air paper balloons did cause 
an enormous stir and everything 
connected with them was written 
down by somebody. Because of 
that we know precisely how the 
invention came about. 

The brothers Montgolfier 
(Jacques Etien and Joseph) be- 
gan by wondering what kept the 
clouds up. And they saw, of 
course, that smoke from a chim- 
ney rose and formed “clouds,” too. 
Was smoke powerful enough to 
carry something up with it? Well, 
sometimes you could see a half- 
burned piece of paper rising. So 
they first built a kind of inverted 
paper bag to catch the smoke, 
and they saw to it that the fire 


was quite smoky by throwing wet 
straw into it. 

In spite of all their mistakes it 
worked. 

They knew — or found out for 
the purpose — that the sphere was 
the body combining largest vol- 
ume with smallest surface. They 
learned that smoke was not indis- 
pensable. And on June 5, 1783, 
they made their first public dem- 
onstration, with an unmanned 
paper balloon about 35 feet in 
diameter. 

One year later the first hydro- 
gen balloon was built, though not 
by the Montgolfiers. 

How quickly the news got 
around is shown by the fact that 
on December 27, 1783, Johann 
Wolfgang von Goethe wrote to a 
friend about the attempts of the 
Court Apothecary Buchholz in 
Weimar “to master the art of 
Montgolfier.” One on still see the 
smile on his face when reading 
his description. “Buchholz tor- 
tures the air but without success. 
The spheres refuse to rise. One of 
them hastily rose to the ceiling, 
but only once.” Interestingly 
Goethe continued that he “had 
resolved to progress slowly, and 
hope to be the first to chase an 
enormous paper ball into the air.” 

History does not know any- 
thing about a hot-air balloon 
built and launched by Goethe. 
Either somebody succeeded be- 
fore him in his area, or else he

was simply too busy to bother. 

What is even more interesting 
is a sketch for an article (dated 
April 11, 1821) which he in- 
tended to write but never did. Its 
theme was that he was very lucky 
to have lived through the second 
half of the 18th century and to 
have seen how such a large num- 
ber of inventions and discoveries 
was made. He then listed the dis- 
coveries and inventions. After the 
word “Balloons” he wrote, “How 
close I was to making this discov- 
ery. Some misgivings that I didn’t 
do it myself. But consoled myself 
soon.” Nobody knows just what 
he meant by these words. Pos- 
sibly, as a young man, he had also 
watched smoke rising and had 
wondered whether it might carry 
something. 

IVTOW for my long delayed re- 

' solve to “check Konrad Kye- 
ser.” 

When I read Mr. Larikov’s let- 
ter suggesting that the Mont- 
golfier brothers were not the ori- 
ginal inventors of the hot-air 
balloon. I remembered that some- 
body else had said the same thing. 
This somebody else had been a 
Swiss engineer by the name of 
Franz Marie Feldhaus, who later 
became famous as a historian of 
technology. (When I met him 
about thirty years ago he told me 
how this had come about. In prin- 
ciple it was quite simple. He did 


not have a job. While waiting for 
one to come along he went to the 
University library, asking the 
librarian for books on the history 
of inventions. Finding these books 
most inadequate he resolved to 
write better books himself. And 
did.) 

But Feldhaus (I don’t know 
just what kind of engineering was 
his specialty) had one weak spot: 
aviation in any form or shape. In 
a book which he wrote in 1907 he 
still maintained stoutly that air- 
planes were a very unlikely in- 
vention. If they could be built at 
all they would have no practical 
value as a means of transporta- 
tion but would be the aerial 
equivalent of a racing yacht. Heli- 
copters, the same book says, were 
a senseless project. And as late as 
1929 space travel was just a fan- 
tastic dream to F. M. Feldhaus. 

Well it was Feldhaus who 
pointed his finger at a device 
which he said employed Mont- 
golfier’s principle long before 
Montgolfier. This device was the 
so-called Dragon Standard (see 
figure), which must have existed 
around the year 1400. No such 
dragon standard has been pre- 
served anywhere, for reasons 
which will become apparent very 
soon. 

We know about them through 
a book called Bellitortis, written 
by Konrad Kyeser von Eichstaedt 
and finished during the last week 


82 


GALAXY 


of August, 1405. Several manu- 
scripts are known. The one from 
w hich this picture of the dragon 
standard is copied is considered 
to be the original. It is not, the 
bibliographical experts believe, in 
Konrad’s handwriting; but it is 
called “the original” because it 
was written down under Konrad’s 

supervision. 

Of course, the Latin text calls 
the standard draco volans (flying 
dragon) and tells that the head 
is made of parchment, the body 
of linen and the tail of silk, each 
of a different color. The purpose 
of the gay monster was twofold. 
It was to signal to your allies 
where you were, and it also was 
to frighten the enemy (who, like 
enemies at any place and any 
time, was supposed to be not only 
evil but also somewhat stupid). 
At night a lamp was to illuminate 
it from within. Konrad Kyeser 
wrote that this lamp should have 
a wick soaked in Oleum benedic- 
tum. The latter was his term for 
“kerosene” and it seems as if he 
wasn’t too sure just what that 


was. 


TT'ONRAD KYESER also 
added that one could use a 
rocket for illumination and said 
that this rocket should be put in 
the dragon’s tail. 

Feldhaus, after examining the 
picture and a few similar ones 
from later hand-written copies of 


the Bellifortis (it never was 
printed), came to the conclusion 
that these dragon standards had 
been early hot-air balloons. Pos- 
sibly — no, very likely — the arti- 
sans who made them knew noth- 
ing about the lifting capacity of 
hot air, Feldhaus said, but as soon 
as they started using these de- 
vices during the night and had to 
put lamps into them to make 
them visible they must have 
noticed that the dragon standards 
no longer needed to be lifted but 
had to be tethered instead ... as 
can clearly be seen in the picture. 

When I read this for the first 
time I thought “how interesting.” 
It did not occur to me to make a 
calculation. 

But if you do, you realize very 
quickly that a little calculating is 
what Feldhaus should have done

before he proclaimed the dragon 
standards to be the forerunners 
of the hot-air balloon. Unlike the 
sphere, this dragon shape has 
litle volume and lots of surface. 
And because of its shape it cannot 
be a simple cloth bag, it needs 
reinforcements in various places. 
In short, the amount of buoyancy 
which hot air could produce 
would be far less than the weight 
of the standard. 

What it really is is a so-called 
fish kite. 

But if it were a kite shouldn’t 
it be shown trailing the rider? 
Yes, it should be. The reason why 
it doesn’t is probably that the 
artist wanted a nice composition 
on the manuscript page. It is also 
possible that the artist had never 
seen one of these kite standards 
demonstrated. And it is just as 
possible that the artist was just 
careless. Paintings of sailing ships 
with the sails billowing one way 
and the flags streaming the other 
are no rarity. 

If one of these kite standards 
had been preserved we could see 
with our own eyes that it was a 
kite and not a hot-air balloon. But 
none has been preserved, I sus- 
pect because of the wick soaked 
in Oleum benedictum. They prob- 
ably all burned up in action.

sil, and I should wait until the 
formal scientific description has 
been published before I write 
about it. But the case is not only 
unique but so surprising in many 
respects that I prefer telling an 
incomplete story to waiting. 

The fossil in question is from 
the black shale of an abandoned 
quarry in North Bergen in New 
Jersey. That black shale is rather 
reliably dated as being 175 mil- 
lion years old, which means it was 


84 


GALAXY 


formed during the latter part of 
the Triassic period. The area then 
was a large freshwater lake, well 
populated with small coelacanth 
fishes. Among more or less well 
preserved coelacanth fossils three 
young men in the upper teens, 
Alfred Siefker, Joe Geiler and 
Mike Bandrowski, found a fossil 
71/2 inch lizard-like reptile, which 
they later handed over to Dr. 
Edwin H. Colbert, head of the 
Department of Vertebrate Pale- 
ontology of the American Muse- 
um of Natural History. 

It turned out to be the earliest 
known “flying reptile.” Since the 
scientific description isn’t out yet 
I don’t know what its name will 
be. Following normal scientific 
usage the name could be Pam- 
protopteryx, but there are a few 
drawbacks to that name, aside 
from the layman’s customary 
complaint that it would be hard 
to pronounce. In the first place, 
naming a new genus is the privi- 
lege of the discoverer or of the 
man who produces the first scien- 
tific description. In the second 
place the name is slightly wrong. 
The Greek root words would 
mean “first of all to fly” but the 
root word for the last part of the 
name pteron means “wing” or 
“fin” and can be stretched to 
mean “paddle.” At any event, it 
implies something active. But the 
reptile from North Bergen did not 
fly actively. 


It did not have wings. It had 
what is best called a parachute; 
and for very good reasons there is 
neither a classical Greek nor a 
classical Latin word for para- 
chute. 

The fact that it did not have 
wings is the big surprise. A winged 
reptile from the late Triassic 
period would have been a novelty 
but it would have been quite logi- 
cal. The two periods which fol- 
lowed after the Triassic were the 
Jurassic and the Cretaceous peri- 
ods, and we know winged reptiles 
from both of htem. In fact, we 
know two types, a short-tailed 
version, the pterodactyls, and a 
long-tailed version, Rhampho- 
rhynchus — the latter known so 
far only from the upper (which 
means more recent) Jurassic of 
Bavaria. The short-tailed ptero- 
dactyls are known to have lived 
from the very early part of the 
Jurassic period until the end of 
the Cretaceous period, when they 
became extinct.

Since even the earliest Jurassic 
pterosaurs (to use the all-inclu- 
sive term for the extinct winged 
reptiles) are rather definite types, 
it is obvious that there must have 
been earlier forms. These earlier 
forerunners of the Jurassic types 
are to be sought in Triassic rocks. 
They couldn’t be anywhere else. 
Hence the discovery of early Tri- 
assic pterosaurs, though it hasn’t 
happened yet, is something to be 
expected. 

But the fossil I misnamed 
Pamprotopteryx above resembles 
in construction something which 
has been in the books, as a living 
reptile, for around 200 years. It 
is a tree lizard from Java and ad- 
jacent islands with an overall 
length of about 8 inches, of which 
the slender tail accounts for 5 
inches. Carolus Linnaeus named 
it Draco volans (I can’t seem to 
get away from “flying dragons” 
in this column!) and zoological 
handbooks state that there are 
about 35 different species of 
them. Nobody is too specific 
about the number of species. 
Some of them may be mistakes 
because the coloration of the in- 
cidentally very beautiful “flying 
dragon” varies considerably from 
one specimen to the next. 

Now Draco volans has a “para- 
chute” spread on each side of its 
body by a number of “false ribs” 
— six of them, in the most com- 
mon species. The North Bergen 


fossil shows the same arrange- 
ment, but with fourteen rib exten- 
sions. Its “parachute” is larger 
than that of Draco volans; the rib 
extensions are five inches long on 
either side. The living Draco vol- 
ans has been observed to cover 
distances up to twenty yards. One 
observer swore that it can avoid 
obstacles while gliding. When it 
reaches the tree trunk where it 
wants to land it lowers its tail — 
held stretched out while gliding — 
and seems to throw its head back, 
obviously getting the “parachute” 
surface into a braking position. 
As a glider, the performance of 
the North Bergen reptile must 
have been at least as good as that 
of the living Draco volans. 

As the pictures show, there can 
be no direct connection between 
the Triassic parachute reptile 
from North Bergen and the ptero- 
saurs of the Jurassic. The latter 
had developed a real wing, a skin 
stretched by one enormously 
elongated finger — the one anato- 



One of the Species of 
“flying dragon”.

GALAXY 


mists call the fourth finger and 
which women refer to as the “ring 
finger.” (The bat’s wing, to get rid 
0 f a possible misunderstanding, is 
stretched by all four fingers, with 
the thumb forming a free hook.) 
As for the ancestry of the ptero- 
saurs, we know that they sprang 
from a group of usually fairly 
small reptiles, probably largely 
tree-dwelling, which bear the 
scientific name of Pseudosuchia. 
There is not much sense in trans- 
lating a label like this, but one 
might refer to them as the pseudo- 
crocodiles. 

During the period preceding 
the Triassic, namely the Permian, 
they had come from an older 
group of reptiles which had split 
into two groups. The pseudosu- 
chians are one of these two. The 
other group is labelled parasu- 
chians and there isn’t much to be 
told about them. But the pseudo- 
suchians had gone on to glory. 
From them sprang the pterosaurs, 
the dinosaurs, the crocodilians 
and even the birds. 

It would be most interesting if 
it turns out that the North Bergen 
fossil is a pseudosuchian too. If so, 
this group would have invented 
flying three times, once in a glid- 
ing form constructed like the liv- 
ing Draco volans (as far as the 
gliding mechanism is concerned), 
once in the shape of the ptero- 
saurs and finally in the form of 
the birds. 


I wish I could tell now what 
forms led to the living Draco 
volans but this is, unfortunately, 
not known. The living form de- 
cidedly belongs to the lizards — 
which did not become important 
until fairly recent geological 
times, namely the Tertiary. But 
Draco volans is now an isolated 
form. It has no near living rela- 
tives and no fossil ancestors are 
known. 

THE BIGGEST GUNS 

I did not get many good ques- 
tions this month, but one which 
came from a reader in Salt Lake 
City will probably use up what 
space I have left. 

The gentleman made a trip to 
Russia last year and, like all tour- 
ists who come to Moscow, he was 
taken to Red Square and shown 
the “Czar Pushka.” ( pushka is 
just the Russian word for “can- 
non.”) During the return trip an- 
other passenger told him that one 
of the Sultans had an even bigger 
cannon built. The question is, 
simply, about the dimensions of 
the Czar Pushka and whether 
there have been bigger guns. 

The dimensions of the highly 
ornamented bronze pushka are: 
length of barrel 22.2 feet, caliber 
45 V 4 inches, weight of barrel 
4310 pounds. Apparently the 
piece was considered more a work 
of art from the outset, for it was

literally never fired (Voltaire 
made a crack about it, saying that 
the two outstanding items of the 
Kremlin are a bell which was 
never rung and a cannon which 
was never fired) and has been on 
public display since the year it 
was cast, which was 1586. 

The other big gun which was 
mentioned by the fellow passen- 
ger of my reader was probably 
the Mohammed II, built for that 
Sultan by a man called “Urban 
the Hungarian” in about 1460. It 
weighed about 2100 pounds and 
its bore was 31 inches. The barrel 
was 21.5 feet long. 

It was in every dimension a bit 
smaller than the Russian piece, 
but, to make up for it, it was fired. 
As Gibbon tells the story in Chap- 
ter LXVTII of his Decline and 
Fall of the Roman Empire: “The 
stone bullet weighed about six 
hundred pounds. A vacant place 
before the new palace was chosen 
for the first experiment; but, to 
prevent the sudden and mischiev- 
ous effects of astonishment and 
fear, a proclamation was issued 
that the cannon would be dis- 
charged the ensuing day. The ex- 
plosion was felt or heard in a cir- 
cuit of a hundred furlongs. The 
ball, by the force of the gunpow- 
der, was driven above a mile; and 
on the spot where it fell it buried 
itself a fathom deep in the 
ground. For the conveyance of 
this destructive engine, a frame or 


carriage of thirty wagons was 
linked together and drawn along 
by a team of sixty oxen. Two hun- 
dred men on both sides were sta- 
tioned to poise and support the 
rolling weight; two hundred and 
fifty workmen marched before to 
smooth the way and repair the 
bridges; and near two months 
were employed in a laborious 
journey of one hundred and fifty 
miles.” 

It is likely that the gun did go 
into action, but it cannot be 
proved. The contemporary writ- 
ers were careless or ill-informed. 
They confused several big guns 
used at the time, and even Mr. 
Gibbon did not succeed in disen- 
tangling their chaotic accounts. 

The next big gun was British. 
It was a siege mortar designed by 
a Mr. Robert Mallet. The bore 
of these mortars (two were built) 
was 36 inches. The barrel length 
was eighty inches above a 48.5 
inch long conical powder cham- 
ber, with an average diameter of 
16 inches. The projectiles were 
cast iron balls 35.6 inches in dia- 
meter which came in three 
weights: 2365, 2550 and 2990 
pounds. They had room for a 
bursting charge weighing 480 
pounds. 

One of the two mortars was 
never test-fired. The other fired a 
number of rounds during the fall 
and winter of 1857. The two mor- 
tars were meant to be used in the 


88 


GALAXY 


Crimean war but never left 
England. 

Two large guns which really 
saw action both are German, one 
for each of the two World Wars. 
The “big gun” of the first World 
War was the “Paris Gun” — also 
called (by the German press) 
“Kaiser Wilhelm Gun” and mis- 
called (by the French press) “Big 
Bertha.” 

Its caliber, as the official desig- 
nation states, was 222 millimeters 
(8.74 inches.) The length of the 
barrel was 110 feet; the shell 
weighed 260 pounds; the range 
was 80 miles. The gun itself 
weighed 154 tons and the cradle 
26 tons. The barrel stood only 
about 60 rounds. Using up a total 
of six barrels, the gun fired a total 
of 367 rounds, all into Paris. 

For the second World War the 
Germans rebuilt one of these 
guns, and in 1941 it was assigned 
to Battery 701. But even official 
German sources do not know 
whether it was used. A German 
gunnery expert who tried to find 
out received the answer, “Since 
the Army had the piece they 
probably fired it. But there are no 
records.” 

But the “big gun” of the Second 
World War was the one called 
“Dora.” Its caliber was 800 milli- 
meters (31.5 inches.) The length 
of the barrel was 106.6 feet, the 
weight 1485 tons (short tons of 
2000 lbs. each) and the range 29 


miles. The shell was 4V£ calibers 
long, weighed 7.8 (short) tons 
and required a propelling charge 
of 4400 lbs. It could fire three 
times per hour. 

To build the firing position for 
Dora took 4000 men and five 
weeks. Firing the gun required 
only 500 men. 

Dora pulverized the fortifica- 
tions of Sevastopol and was then 
brought to Leningrad (needing 
three trains just for the gun), but 
did not see action again. By then 
the German High Command had 
come to the conclusion that Dora 
was too big. Two other guns of the 
same type that had been built 
were not even sent to the front 
lines. —WILLY LEY

A NDREW Stephens was 
trying to think of two 
things at once, and it 
wasn’t working out. An inspira- 
tional message (delivered by 
Crumbly, president of Planetary 
Promotions, Inc.) was mixing it- 
self up in his mind with the 
probable difficulties of his first 
company assignment. 

He hoped he was thinking, and 
not worrying. Crumbly said worry 
was fatal in the promotion 
business. It was fervor, not fret, 
Crumbly said, that had made 
Planetary Promotions, Inc., what 
it was today. And it was work, 
not worry, that would make it 
what it was destined to be to- 
morrow. 


Andy Stephens stared at the 
farthest corner of his office (about 
four feet from his nose) and 
sighed. He didn’t have a slogan 
in his body, let alone on (or off) 
the top of his head. 

His assignment was an easy 
one, Crumbly had assured him. 
Planetary Promotions always 
started new men off with easy 
ones. Only fair. 

Andy squared his narrowish 
shoulders in as close an imitation 
of Crumbly’s desk-side manner as 
he could, and picked up the dope 
sheet. 

It seemed there was a planet, 
Felix II, somewhere near the 
edge of nowhere. It wanted to 
join the Galactic Federation.

A laudable desire, Andy 
thought, but strictly a political 
matter, having nothing to do with 
Planetary Promotions, or Andrew 
Stephens. 

However, it also seemed that 
a planet had to demonstrate that 
it would be contributing some- 
thing to the Federation before it 
was allowed to join. In other 
words, Andy thought, you have 
to have something they want, or 
they won’t let you in. 

A buzzer squawked out of the 
dun-colored box on his desk. 
Andy jumped, and flipped the 
lever. 

“The bus to the port will be 
at the door in seven minutes,” 
the grim voice of the Lower Of- 


fice Co-ordinator told him. “A 
stenographer will meet you on the 
ship.” 

“Thank you, Miss Ellis,” Andy 
said meekly. He stuffed the dope 
sheet into his jacket and left the 
Main Office for Felix II. 

ii'E’XCUSE me,” said a femi- 
nine voice. “Are you with 
Planetary Promotions?” 

Andy looked up. A sandy- 
haired girl with a passable figure 
and nice legs was looking down 
at him. “Yes,” he said. “I’m Andy 
Stephens.” 

The girl looked relieved. “I’m 
Edith Featherpenny from the 
steno pool,” she said. “I was afraid 
I wouldn’t be able to find you.”

“Sit down,” Andy invited. 

He moved, and Miss Feather- 
penny moved. Between them, 
they unsettled a large woman eat- 
ing an orange. When the juice 
had been mopped up and the 
woman apologized to, Miss 
Featherpenny squeezed in beside 
Andy. 

“Is that the information on the 
case?” She indicated the dope 
sheet crumpled under Andy’s 
arm. 

“Yes.” Andy tried to pull it 
out. “Were you issued one?” He 
moved his elbow and tried again. 

The orange woman glared at 
him. 

Miss Featherpenny shook her 
head. “Miss Ellis told me you’d 
tell me everything I needed to 
know.” 

Andy felt obscurely flattered. 
“It doesn’t look too promising,” 
he admitted. 

Miss Featherpenny glanced at 
the dope sheet and found a ray 
of hope. “The Federation only 
requires that the Felician exports 
are nearly as valuable as their 
imports,” she pointed out. 
“ ‘Nearly’ is a nice vague, maneu- 
verable word.” 

“But,” said Andy, “if the Feli- 
cians can’t think of anything to 
sell, how do they expect me to?” 

“Maybe they’re too isolated to 
know what’s in demand,” Miss 
Featherpenny comforted him. 
“It says they won’t authorize ships 


to land on the planet except by 
invitation.” 

“It might be isolation, I sup- 
pose,” Andy doubted. He felt an 
urge to confide in Miss Feather- 
penny. She did, after all, look as 
if there might be something be- 
sides fluff in her head. 

“Look,” he said. “This is my 
first assignment, on my fourth 
job, on my second career. I’ve got 
to make good. My father is begin- 
ning to get impatient.” 

Miss Featherpenny’s eyes grew 
softer. “Fathers are usually more 
patient than their children think,” 
she encouraged. 

“But,” Andy added morosely, 
“I have a brother, a salesman 
with Universal Products. He 
keeps getting promoted, and I 
keep getting fired. Dad must be 
conscious of the contrast.” 

“Maybe,” Miss Featherpenny 
suggested, “your brother’s been 
lucky. You know, being assigned 
jobs that were easier than they 
sound.” 

Andy glanced at her to see if 
he was being humored. He 
decided he was not, or not much. 
“I’ve tried to believe that,” he 
admitted. “Unfortunately, Lloyd 
keeps proving me wrong. He got 
his last promotion for selling 
fancy food products to the Mah- 
ridgians.” 

Miss Featherpenny had ob- 
viously never even heard of Mah- 
ridge. 


“They have a strong taboo 
against eating,” Andy explained. 
“They swallow concentrates to 
jjeep alive, but it’s still not quite 
Recent. On Mahridge, it’s the din- 
j n g room, not the bathroom, that 
has a door with a lock on it for 
privacy. 

“Is he married?” asked Miss 
Featherpenny, who didn’t intend 
t0 be a steno all her life. “I 
mean,” she added quickly, “his 
wife would get anxious about his 
selling something like that, that 
could get him put in prison, or 
killed. How did he do it?” 

There was a certain coolness 
in Andy’s voice. “He took a lead 
from the dope peddlers. He con- 
verted the adolescent Mahrid- 
gians first. It’s all right to eat on 
Mahridge now.” 

Miss Featherpenny diplomat- 
ized. “I don’t think that’s ethical. 
Convincing people to do what 
they think is wrong.” 

Andy was still suspicious. He 
said, “Ethical or not, he got the 
promotion.” 

'T'HEY stood at the edge of the 
only launching pad on Felix 
II, and surveyed the landscape. 
Thirty feet away, there was a 
bamsized stone building with a 
weedy roof. Aside from some 
rounded blue hills in the distance, 
and a Felician leaning against 
the building, there was not much 
to detain the eye.

SATISFACTION GUARANT 





Miss Featherpenny giggled 
softly in surprise. “He looks like 
a leprechaun,” she said. “The 
sheet didn’t say that.” 

“Tourist trade,” Andy breathed, 
his eyes gleaming with the solu- 
tion of his problem. 

Since the two-foot-tall welcom- 
ing committee showed no signs 
of moving, they started toward 
him. 

“My name,” Andy said in 
Galactic, “is Andrew Stephens. 
I’m here from Planetary Promo- 
tions.” 

“I know,” the Felician mutter- 
ed ungraciously. “I came out from 
town to meet you. My name is 
Blahrog. Who’s this?” 

“My steno, Miss Featherpen- 
ny.” 

“Urk.” Obviously Blahrog had 
never heard the term “steno” and 
was interpreting it freely. “I’m 
in charge of our admission to the 
Federation. That means I’m in 
charge of you.” He eyed Andy 
unenthusiastically. “You haven’t 
had much experience with this 
kind of thing, have you?” 

Andy had a wild rush of hope. 
If the Felician government re- 
jected him as a representative, 
he could go home without a fail- 
ure on his record, and pray for a 
simpler assignment. Even P. P. 
didn’t consider an agent respon- 
sible for the unpredictable whims 
of aliens. 

“No, I haven’t,” he replied 
E E D 93 


cheerfully. “I was hoping maybe 
you had.” 

Miss Featherpenny, who hadn’t 
read the contract, gasped. 

Blahrog, who had read the con- 
tract, replied, “I haven’t. Let’s 
get on into town where we can 
discuss the possibilities in com- 
fort.” 

They set out, walking un- 
equally through the thick white 
dust that passed for paving on 
Felix II. 

“Don’t you use ground cars?” 
Miss Featherpenny choked at the 
end of the first half-mile. 

“Don’t have technology,” Blah- 
rog growled, stumping grimly 
along. “The Everking has a car, 
but he doesn’t use it much. No 
fuel.” 

As he walked, Andy composed 
a speech on the merits of the 
tourist business, to be delivered 
to the Everking. 

Miss Featherpenny grew visi- 
bly more depressed with each 
mile. She uttered an involuntary 
cry when the guard of the city 
gate appeared with a slender 
mug in each hand. 

“Felician ladies don’t drink,” 
Blahrog said gruffly. 

“I can fetch you a glass of 
water,” the guard offered, without 
enthusiasm. 

“Thank you,” said Miss Fea- 
therpenny, with an attempt at 
sincerity. 

The contents of his mug made 


Andy choke. “Tastes 
like cider,” he gasped. 

Blahrog downed his without a 
wink. “It’s customary to give a 
guest a mug of Throatduster as a 
sign of gratitude because he 
walked so far in the dust.” 

“In this dust,” Miss Feather 
penny murmured to her second 
glass of water, “any distance is 
far.” 

“Thoughtful custom,” Andy 
said quickly. “Could you export 
the beverage?” 

“Sell Throatduster?” Blahrog 
was indignant. “It would be a 
breach of hospitality. Besides, 
Felix II can’t produce enough 
second-rate stuff, let alone first- 
rate. Sometimes, in a bad year, 
we have to greet guests with 
water.” 

“What a pity,” said Miss Fea- 
therpenny. 

CHE became increasingly un- 
^ sympathetic as Andy swal- 
lowed another Throatduster at 
the door of the Palace (a one- 
story building similar to a small 
barn), and yet another in the 
presence of the Everking (an 
eighteen-inch Felician with a 
beard-warmed paunch). 

Andy watched the Everking 
dim and blur on his wooden 
throne. Swaying slightly, he 
{fluttered, “I wonder what proof 
this stuff is?” 

“In short, Mr. Stephens,” Blah- 



94 


GALAXY 


ro g was translating, “we cannot 
think of a single product which 
w e could sell. Have you any im- 
mediate suggestions?” 

Blahrog’s expression indicated 
that he ought to say something, 
hut Andy couldn’t think of a 
thing, except that he didn’t need 
a ny more Throatduster. “No,” he 
said firmly, if faintly. “Thank you 
very much, but no.” He passed 
out cold. 

“I’m afraid the journey was 
too much for him,” Miss Feather- 
penny put in. 

“Ah, yes,” Blahrog translated 
for the Everking. “Throatduster 
has that effect on some life forms. 
Perhaps he had better retire, and 
discuss the situation more fully 
tomorrow.” 

The Everking motioned to a 
pair of stout-looking guards 
(thirty inches tall, at least). They 
towed Miss Featherpenny’s im- 
mediate superior out of the royal 
presence. 

“They will show him to his 
room,” Blahrog explained. 

The Everking let loose a quick 
stream of Felician. 

“Would you,” Blahrog ad- 
dressed Miss Featherpenny, “en- 
joy meeting my daughter? The 
Everking suggests it, since our 
affairs could hardly be of interest 
to you.” 

“I’d be very pleased.” The 
words were not empty ones. Edith 
Featherpenny’s education in cop- 


ing with men had not extended 
to Felician males. Blahrog fright- 
ened her with a feeling of supe- 
rior and incomprehensible intel- 
ligence. 

Hrom, although seventeen 
inches tall and weighing perhaps 
eleven pounds, was definitely 
feminine and comprehensible. 

“Why don’t women drink 
Throatduster?” Miss Feather- 
penny asked, on the strength of 
a two-hour acquaintance. 

“The men grow the grain here,” 
Hrom explained, “and it’s theirs 
as long as it’s in the fields. How- 
ever, we consider harvesting 
women’s work. We also make the 
Throatduster. Then we sell it to 
the men. We don’t drink because 
it is uneconomical.” 

“Does everyone grow his own 
grain?” 

“Not any more. Town women 
have other sources of dress 
money. The custom started that 
way, that’s all.” 

“If you’ll forgive my saying so,” 
Miss Featherpenny remarked, 
“that dress you are wearing must 
have taken a big chunk out of 
your pocket.” 

Hrom sighed. “In my mother’s 
time, I would have thought 
nothing of it. Now, one such 
gown is all I can afford.” 

“I would have thought your 
father was one of the wealthier 
men on Felix II,” Miss Feather- 
penny remarked. 


SATISFACTION GUARANTEED

“He is the wealthiest,” Hrom 
said. “The richest man is always 
Minister of Finance. It’s only 
reasonable.” Her tone changed. 
“We’re all poor now, since the 
tourist industry failed. It took 
every dnot we had to pay for the 
contract.” 

Invisible antennae shot from 
Miss Featherpenny’s forehead. 
“You must be quite sure that 
Planetary Promotions won’t fail 
you.” She tried her best to sound 
casual. 

Hrom smiled faintly. “Have 
another of these seed cakes,” she 
said. 

“Thank you. They are deli- 
cious.” Miss Featherpenny took 
one, regardless of calories. “Of 
course, there is the guarantee 
clause: ‘Double your money 

back.’ ” 

Hrom busily fluffed a cushion. 
“One must have some insurance,” 
she said, having her turn at 
sounding casual. “Tell me, are 
they wearing large or small hats 
on Earth this season?” 

Miss Featherpenny conceded 
defeat. “It’s all bonnets for sum- 
mer,” she said. 

TTER first impulse was to tell 
Andy that she thought the 
Felicians had bought the guar- 
antee clause, not the contract. It 
died at her first sight of the 
morning-after Andy. The situa- 
tion must be pretty desperate, she 

96 


rationalized, when the wealthiest' 
girl on the planet has only one ' 
dress. This is probably their last 
chance. 

Andy tried to conceal his head- 
ache by being brisk and efficient 
“Have you considered your 
natural resources?” 

Blahrog, slow and shrewdly 
inefficient, said, “We mine soft 
coal. Enough for our own fires and 
to spare.” 

“No one within a hundred 
light-years of Felix II uses coal 
for fuel anymore,” Andy said 
gently. “Do you have enough for 
the plastic industries?” 

“We have four freighters sur- 
plus every season.” Blahrog was 
evidently banking heavily on the 
coal. 

Andy wondered if coal were 
the only surplus on Felix II. 
“What are you doing with your 
surplus at present?” he inquired 
tactfully, hoping that Elahrog 
would realize, without being told, 
the impossibility of supporting 
the population of Felix II on four 
freighters of soft coal. 

“We store it up,” was the 
crafty answer, “and sell it to the 
synthetics plants on Darius IV 
when the Ionian miners go on 
strike.” 

“How long since the Ionians 
struck?” If this economic event 
occurred regularly, the coal sur- 
plus could assist in meeting the 
Federation’s requirements. 

GALAXY 







“Twenty seasons or so.” Blah- 
rog’s tone was off-handed, but his 
eyes slid guiltily toward Andy 
and away again. 

Andy sighed. “Any other re- 
sources?” 

They went quickly through 
minerals, agricultural products 
and animal skins; established that 
Felicians could not teleport, levi- 
tate or read minds. They were 
technologically uneducated, and 
had no industry on the factory- 
system level. 

“It is coal or nothing, Mr. 
Stephens,” Blahrog said with 
finality. “Isn’t there some way to 
make the Federation believe that 
our coal is superior to other coal, 
and worth more?” 

“Do you, perchance, own a size- 
able proportion of Felician coal 
reserves?” 

Blahrog nodded, guilty looking 
again. 

“Well, forget it. There isn’t 
enough.” 

'T'HE Everking, who had been 

holding Andy’s translator to 
his ear in silence, burst into 
speech. 

“His Foreverness says,” Blahrog 
remarked cannily, “that it appears 
impossible for Felix II to join the 
Federation.” 

“We aren’t through yet,” Andy 
said quickly. “What about the 
tourist industry? If you’d allow 
visitors and advertise a little . .” 


“No,” the Everking shouted, i n 
Galactic. 

“We tried that during the last 
reign,” Blahrog said. “It didn’t 
work.” 

“You’re pretty far off the ship, 
ping lanes, I’ll admit,” Andy said, 
“but surely you could attract 
enough tourists from somewhere 
to show a profit.” 

“We showed a profit,” Blahrog 
said morosely. 

He translated a remark of the 
Everking’s. “We made money 
hand over fist.” 

“Then why did you quit?” 
Andy was baffled. “Why did you 
restrict the planet?” 

“Because of the way we happen 
to look.” 

“Like leprechauns,” Miss Fea- 
therpenny explained. “And Hrom 
looks exactly like a little Christ- 
mas fairy.” 

Blahrog winced. “The tourists 
found us amusing. We weren’t 
real to them. It became difficult 
for us to seem real to ourselves. 
Most of my generation couldn’t 
grow up. The birth rate dropped. 
We closed the planet to keep the 
race alive. That’s all there is to 
it.” 

“Surely,” Andy protested, “if 
you handled it differently . .” 

“Tourists,” Blahrog translated 
for the Everking, “are out of the 
question.” 

“I remember hearing about an 
intelligent life form that resem- 


98 


GALAXY 




b jed teddy bears,” Miss Feather- 
penny said thoughtfully. “Every- 
body loved them on sight.” 

“What happened to them?” 
Blahrog asked with interest. 
“They became extinct.” 


A NDY glared at her. How could 
he accomplish anything with 
a stupid steno butting in? She 
looked away, guilty. 

“It’s such a simple solution,” he 
said. “It fits your situation per- 
fectly.” 

“That’s what we thought, until 
we tried it,” Blahrog said, grin- 
ning sidelong at Miss Feather- 
penny. 

“If you won’t try tourists,” 
Andy snapped at both of them, 
“I don’t see exactly what you can 
do.” 

“Maybe you didn’t cover every- 
thing in the special abilities list,” 
Miss Featherpenny suggested 
softly. 

Andy glared at her again. “All 
right, Blahrog. Can you think of 
anything you can do that most 
other species can’t?” 

Blahrog looked at the floor and 
considered. “We can walk a long 
way without getting tired,” he 
offered. 

Andy sighed, and wrote “En- 
durance?” on his scratch pad. It 
was scarcely saleable. “Is there 
anything else? Anything you 
know how to make? Besides 
Throatduster.” 


- “We make good shoes,” Blah- 
rog said hopefully. “The tourists 
used to buy lots of them.” 

“Hum,” Andy cogitated. “Here 
we have something for which a 
market already exists. If we can 
expand the market and the pro- 
duction facilities . .” He nailed 
Blahrog with a finger, in con- 
scious imitation of Crumbly. 
“How many pairs of shoes can 
Felix II produce in a single 
season?” 

“If the reserves were called in 
to the Cobbler’s, Guild, it would 
be almost half the manpower of 
the planet . .” Blahrog paused, 
doing mental arithmetic. “Four 
and a half million pairs, more or 
less.” He sounded as though he 
were surprised. 

“That ought to do it,” Andy 
said gleefully. 

“But where will we find that 
many pairs of feet?” Blahrog 
asked. 

“There are eight million times 
that many pairs of feet in the 
Federation,” Andy said. “Leave 
the advertising to Planetary Pro- 
motions.” 

“It seems sort of poetic,” Miss 
Featherpenny romanced. “Lepre- 
chauns are supposed to be cob- 
blers.” 

Blahrog snorted. 

Andy turned and addressed her

therpenny, I will ask for your 
opinion when I want it.” 

Miss Featherpenny answered 
from her side of the gulf. “Yes, 
sir.” 

Andy had always despised 
rank-pullers. He turned to Blah- 
rog. “I’ll have to send the dope 
back to the Home Office so they 
can put it through the computer 
and send me the ad-intensity 
index.” 

Blahrog looked a polite en- 
quiry. 

“That will tell us how effective 
the ad campaign will have to be 
to make a go of this. What’s the 
fastest way to send a message to 
Earth?” 

“Radiogram the satellite sta- 
tion,” Blahrog answered. “They’ll 
relay it to the next ship within 
range, and the ship will relay it to 
the next planet it nears with the 
radiogram facilities to send it to 
Earth.” 

“How long will it take to get 
an answer?” Andy asked. 

“About twelve days.” 

r | ''HEY didn’t stare at the sky 
while they waited for the 
answer. 

Blahrog called the members of 
the Cobbler’s Guild together, and 
delivered a series of lectures on 
their importance to the future of 
Felix II. 

Foreseeing a return to political 
and economic power, the reserve 


members dusted off their lasts 1 
and aprons and got back into 1 
practice. For the first time in 
nearly thirty seasons, the applica- 
tions for apprenticeship were too 
numerous to handle. New lif e 
showed on their faces. 

The Master Cobblers (includ- 
ing the Everking and Blahrog) 
worked around the clock, fab- 
ricating plastic lasts. Miss Fea- 
therpenny and Hrom dug pic- 
tures and descriptions of the 
various types of Galactic feet that 
habitually or occasionally wore 
shoes out of old periodicals, lo- 
cated by members of the newly- 
organized ladies’ auxiliary. 

Felix II was humming, if not 
absolutely singing, with industry 
and good humor. Some of it 
rubbed off on Andy. He relented 
toward Miss Featherpenny to the 
extent of presenting her with a 
pair of Felician shoes, fabricated 
by the Everking. They were of 
the sensible walking variety, and 
not Miss Featherpenny’s style. 
Nevertheless, she was extremely 
pleased with the gift. Like all 
Felician shoes, they fit her per- 
fectly. 

The Everking, backed by his 
Debators and ministers, issued 
public thanks to one Andrew 
Stephens, restorer of hope, and 
propagator of economic equality. 
The ladies’ auxiliary gave a tea 
in Miss Featherpenny’s honor. 
They were both showered with 

GALAXY 


gifts from a grateful and admir- 
ing populace. 

The reply to the message was 
signed by Crumbly himself. “For- 
lorn hope,” it said unsympathet- 
ically. “Try something else. Com- 
puter indicates ad intensity of 
0.94.” 

An ad intensity of 0.0001 
means you sell someone some- 
thing he wants anyway. An in- 
tensity of 1.0 means you have to 
make the consumer love some- 
thing he thinks he hates. 

A NDY sent a young Felician on 
■‘•-the run for Blahrog, and re- 
tired to the storeroom of Blah- 
rog’s dwelling, which housed two 
fair-sized plastic barrels of 
Throatduster. 

“But you have to try,” Blahrog 
insisted, finishing his second mug 
of hospitality. 

“Snow good,” Andy said, deep 
into his fifth. “Even Gray Flan- 
nel, ad man in legend, only got 
to 0.87. Simpossible.” 

Blahrog, who knew little about 
advertising or computers, re- 
peated, “You must try. No mem- 
ber of the Cobbler’s Guild has 
ever quit without trying.” 

Andy had been accepted as an 
apprentice of the Guild the night 
before. 

“Dunno,” he said. “Tell you 
simpossible.” 

Blahrog climbed off the barrel 
of Throatduster. “I’ll go get Miss 

SATISFACTION GUAR ANTE 


Featherpenny,” he said. “Per- 
haps she can help you.” 

“Miss Featherpenny. Bah,” 
Andy snorted. “What good would 
she be? Dumb steno.” He tried to 
be fair. “Nice legs, I admit. But 
no brains.” 

“I’ll go get Miss Featherpenny,” 
Blahrog repeated firmly, closing 
the door behind him . 

“What frame of mind is he in?” 
Miss Featherpenny looked un- 
certainly at the heavy door to 
Andy’s store room. 

“Drunk,” Blahrog informed her 
coldly. 

It takes an enormous quantity 
of Throatduster to intoxicate a 
Felician. Intoxication is therefore 
considered bad form. 

“And belligerent,” the Minister 
of Finance added. 

“Oh, dear.” Miss Featherpenny 
looked at the door again. “But 
what can I do?” she asked in a 
helpless voice. “I’m not a pro- 
moter.” 

“He said,” Blahrog indicated 
the door, “that you were a dumb 
steno.” 

“Well!” Hrom exclaimed. 

Miss Featherpenny’s hackles 
invisibly rose. Her mouth visibly 
tightened. She turned away from 
the door. 

Hrom said, “You ought to try 
to show him.” 

Miss Featherpenny looked at 
them, and at the surrounding 
examples of Felician landscape

and architecture. 

“Mr. Blahrog,” she said sud- 
denly, “you don’t mind looking 
like a leprechaun, do you? As 
long as you don’t have to meet 
people?” 

Blahrog’s silence was more 
than dignified. 

“What do you mean?” Hrom 
asked. 

“You wouldn’t mind if we used 
a picture of a Master Cobbler 
in the ad, would you?” 

Blahrog thawed abruptly. “You 
have an idea?” 

“If you don’t mind the pic- 
ture.” 

“He doesn’t mind,” Hrom said, 
adding in Felician, “After all, 
Papa, we don’t have to let any 
ships but the freighters land.” 

“Go ahead, then,” Blahrog con- 
sented. 

“Good luck,” Hrom added. 

Andy welcomed her. 
A “Bah.” He shut his eyes. 
Most of him was sprawled out on 
the floor. 

“Yes, me,” Miss Featherpenny 
agreed, repressing an inclination 
to kick him. She sat down on one 
of the kegs, and opened her steno- 
grapher’s book. “I came to take 
down the ad for the shoes, she 
announced. 

“What ad?” Andy moaned. 
“The newest, biggest, brightest 
ads can’t get over an 0.62. How 
can I manage an 0.94? You’re 


crazy.” He opened his eyes. “But 
you do have nice legs.” 

“Felix II is sort of quaint,” Miss 
Featherpenny suggested. “Why 
not use an old ad?” 

“An idea,” Andy enunciated, 
without hope. 

“It’s sort of pretty too,” Miss 
Featherpenny nudged. 

“We could use a color picture 
of it,” Andy said, kicking thought- 
fully at an overturned stool. 

“The Felicians are quaint look- 
ing, too.” 

“Sure,” Andy said. “Put a Feli- 
cian in the foreground, cobbling.” 
He tried to sit up. 

“I’ve seen ads like that in his- 
tory books,” Miss Featherpenny 
said, exuding admiration. 

“It’s so old it’s new,” Andy said, 
lying down again. “Old English 
lettering over the top. A rea 
cliche.” He considered Miss Fea- 
therpenny’s ankle. “Peaceful scen- 
ery, Felician shoes?” 

“Not quite,” said Miss Feather- 
penny. 

“Quiet field, Felician shoes?” 
“Nope,” said Miss Feather- 
penny. 

“You’re an aggravating wom- 
an,” Andy said sweetly, but you 
do have nice legs.” 

“What about Elysian fields?” 
Miss Featherpenny suggested. 

Andy tasted it. “Elysian fields, 
Felician shoes.” He tried to sit up 
again. “You got all that down?” 
he demanded.

“Yes,” Miss Featherpenny lied, 
ghe had it in her head, but not on 
the steno pad. 

“Then get somebody to send it 
off so we can find out if it’s good 
enough. And come back soori.” 
jje wobbled on his elbow. “You 
do have . .” 

“I think I’d better attend to 
sending it personally.” Miss Fea- 
therpenny opened the door. “You 
rest until you feel better.” 

Blahrog had gone, but Hrom 
was waiting for her. She looked 
more like a Christmas fairy than 
usual. A mischievous one. 

“Did you manage?” she whis- 
pered. 

“Barely.” Miss Featherpenny 
looked grim. 

“Drink this,” Hrom ordered, 
holding out a mug of Throat- 
duster. 

Miss Featherpenny was sur- 
prised. “I thought ladies didn’t 
drink on Felix II.” 

“There are,” Hrom said, “ex- 
ceptions.” 

fT^HE next twelve days of wait- 
ing for computer results were 
not as hopefully active as the 
first twelve. The Felicians finished 
setting up their manufacturing 
and storing systems, but they 
didn’t start making shoes. The 
cattle drovers forbore to slaughter 
the beasts who provided the 
leather. 

The Everking and his Debaters 


all developed severe cases of 
beard-itch, a Felician nervous 
disorder. Since it is even more 
unseemly to scratch on Felix II 
than it is on Earth, they retired 
temporarily from public life. 

Andy also retired from public 
life, biting his fingernails, an 
Earther nervous disorder. Blahrog 
joined him in the illness, which 
was new to Felicians. By the time 
the answer from Planetary Pro- 
motions came it was the most 
fashionable habit on the planet, 
in spite of the fact that Felicians 
have extremely tough nails, and 
a pair of bony ridges rather than 
true teeth. 

The second message was also 
direct from Crumbly. It read: 
“Computer rates ad campaign at 
intensity 0.942. P. P. in action 
by the time you receive this. 
Stephens ordered back to Home 
Office; promoted to first class.” 

Four Earth months later, Miss 
Featherpenny entered Andy’s ten 
by twelve office, her high heels 
clicking on the plastic tiles, and 
laid a memorandum on the new 
steel desk. 

“They’ve been admitted,” she 
announced. 

‘What? Who?” Andy said ir- 
ritably. There were times when 
he thought her position as his 
private secretary had gone to her 
head. 

“Felix II has been admitted to 
the Federation. The contract has 


SATISFACTION GUARANTEED 


103 


been fulfilled.” She smiled 
brightly. “Shall I mark the file 
closed?” 

“Can’t yet,” Andy said. “Felix 
II won’t be a permanent member 
of the Federation until they’ve 
been self-surporting for ten 
years.” 

“Why?” asked Miss Feather- 
penny. 

“It’s a precautionary measure,” 
Andy began to explain. “Oh, let’s 
go get some lunch and forget 
Felix II.” 

“Yes, Mr. Stephens,” Miss Fea- 
therpenny said meekly. 

He followed her out the door, 
admiring the effect of her glastic 
skirt. She did have nice legs . 

f T'HREE years later, Edith Fea- 
therpenny was forced to re- 
member Felix II. There was a 
communication on her mock- 
baroque desk. Felician shoes 
weren’t selling. Felix II wasn’t 
making enough money. The 
Galactic Federation was threaten- 
ing to take steps. 

She glanced at the impressive 
door 'to the inner office. Andy, 
she knew, was engaged in reading 
a letter from his brother Lloyd, 
who had just been promoted to 
vice-president of Universal Prod- 
ucts. 

She judiciously forged his ini- 
tials on an order to put data on 
the Felix II failure through the 
computer. 


In an hour and a half she had 
the answer. The Felicians hadn’t 
changed the styles, and their shoes 
didn’t wear out. Everybody had 
a pair. 

She considered the door again. 
There was really little sense in 
disturbing Andy over such a 
simple matter. She forged his 
name on a message to Blahrog. 
“Change the styles of your shoes.” 

She then picked up some care- 
fully selected problem sheets 
from the top of the filing cabinet, 
and went through the impressive 
door. 

The next morning, Blahrog’s 
answer was on her desk. 

“Felician shoes are of the cut 
most suited to the feet that wear 
them. To change them would be 
both foolish and unethical.” 

It was a good thing, Miss Fea- 
therpenny thought, that Andy 
was feeling better today. She 
went into his office, padding 
softly over the carpet to his con- 
temporary prestwood desk. 

“Good morning, Edie,” Andy 
said cheerfully. “What happened? 
Lightning strike you?” 

“Practically,” Miss Feather- 
penny said. “It’s Felix II again.” 
She handed over the sheaf of 
papers. 

“Why didn’t you tell me about 
this yesterday?” Andy muttered, 
reading them. 

“I thought I could handle it.” 
Miss Featherpenny made a face. 


"Until I got that answer this 

morning.” 

"It sounds like typical Felician 
thinking,” Andy said. “There’s no 
sense trying to argue by mail.” 
He sighed. “You’d better reserve 
a first-class passage for me on the 
first ship out.” 

“Can’t I go?” Miss Feather- 
penny asked. 

“Who’d run the office?” 

‘The stenos can stack stuff 
until we get back.” Miss Fea- 
therpenny looked wistful. “I was 
in on the beginning of it. I want 
to see it through. Besides, I’d like 
to see Hrom again.” 

“Oh, all right,” Andy agreed. 
“Make it two first class.” 

QLAHROG was waiting on the 
long porch of the space port 
dining room. 

“Have a nice trip?” he asked. 
“What’s all this about not 
changing the shoe styles?” Andy 
countered. 

“As I told you in the mes- 
sage,” Blahrog said impatiently, 
“We make our shoes in the best 
possible shapes for the feet that 
will wear them. There isn’t any 
good reason to change them.” 
“You can’t sell people two pairs 
of identical shoes,” Andy insisted. 

“You might be able to sell 
them if you changed them,” Miss 
Featherpenny added, sounding 
reasonable. 

“Save your arguments for the 


Everking,” Blahrog said. “Come 
on to the car.” 

“Car?” Miss Featherpenny ex- 
claimed. “The Everking’s?” 

“No, mine.” Blahrog couldn’t 
keep the pride out of his voice. 
“There are nearly two hundred 
cars on Felix II.” 

Andy went over the same 
ground in the presence of the 
Everking. It didn’t help. The 
Everking, his minister and his 
Debators were solidly against 
changing the shoes. The ethics of 
the Cobblers’ Guild were in- 
volved. 

“If you won’t follow Planetary 
Promotions’ advice,” he said at 
last, “the company can’t be re- 
sponsible for the outcome.” He 
glared at the assembly. “In other 
words, the guarantee clause is 
cancelled.” 

There was an indignant and 
concerned buzz from the au- 
dience. Blahrog got up. 

“Your Foreverness,” he said, 
“honorable members of the 
government, Mr. Stephens. Three 
Earth years ago, Felix II gath- 
ered together all the money the 
government could find, and 
bought a contract with Planetary 
Promotions.” He paused and 
shuffled his feet. “We did not 
expect the contract to be fulfilled. 
We needed money, and two for 
one would keep us going while we 
attempted to educate the young 
to be immune to the tourists. Of 


104

course, if Planetary Promotions 
found a way for us to be self- 
surporting without tourists, we 
would be equally pleased.” 

“I thought so,” Miss Feather- 
penny murmured. 

“Really,” Andy said. “Why 
didn’t you let me in on it?” 
Blahrog cleared his throat to 
indicate that he wasn’t through. 
“Since a way was found,” he con- 
tinued, “Felician self respect and 
content has increased along with 
Felician prosperity.” He glanced 
uneasily at Andy. “We would like 
to continue as we are going.” 
“Unless you change the styles,” 
Andy said flatly, “that is impossi- 
ble.” 

M ISS Featherpenny, realizing 
that they were starting over 
the same ground, slipped out the 
door and walked over to visit 
Hrom. 

“So Papa admitted it,” Hrom 
said, after Miss Featherpenny 
had admired the baby, and been 
shown over the house. “I almost 
told you myself, when I first met 
you.” 

“You told me enough to let me 
guess the rest,” Miss Feather- 
penny said. 

“Have some olgan seed cakes,” 
Hrom offered. “Why didn’t you 
tell Mr. Stephens?” 

Miss Featherpenny took a 
cake. “Partly because of his 
almighty attitude, and partly be- 


cause I was on your . Ow!” ■' face. “I’ve hardly been out of the

jaw. 

“What’s wrong?” Hrom asked, 
alarmed. 

“Broke a tooth,” Miss Feather- 
penny muttered, her face con- 
torted. 

“Does it hurt much?” Hrom’s 
question was part sympathy and 
part curiosity. 

Miss Featherpenny nodded. 
“I’ll have to find a dentist right 
away.” 

“What’s a dentist?” 

“Man who fixes your teeth.” 

“But we don’t have teeth,” 
Hrom said. 

“I forgot,” Miss Featherpenny 
moaned. “Oh, Lord, I guess I’ll 
have to go all the way back to 
Earth.” 

Hrom shook her head. “There 
are a lot of Earthers living on 
Darius IV. They must have a 
dentist. There’s a ship every 
morning.” 

“Fine,” Miss Featherpenny 
gasped. 

“Can I get you something for 
the pain? Would an aspirtran 
help?” 

“I’d better have two. Thanks.” 

“Here. Take the bottle with 
you.” Hrom was frowning wor- 
riedly. “My, Fm glad we don’t 
have teeth.” 

“I’ll have to tell Andy — Mr. 
Stephens — that I’m leaving.” 

Inspiration dawned on Hrom’s 


I’ll leave him with my husband’s 
mother and go with you.” 

“I’d be glad of the company,” 
Miss Featherpenny admitted. 

“Good. I’ll find out what time 
the ship leaves, and tell Mother 
Klagom about the treat she’s got 
coming. You go tell Mr. Stephens 
and then come back here for the 
night.” 

Miss Featherpenny heard them 
shouting before she opened the 
council chamber door. 

“I suggest,” Andy was saying, 
“that you either change the styles 
or go back to the tourist business.” 
She pushed the door open. 

“Mr. Stephens,” Blahrog said 
mildly, “the last time calamity 
was upon us, you solved the 
problem by drinking Throat- 
duster until you got an idea. May 
I suggest that you try again?” 
“Andy,” Miss Featherpenny 
whispered. 

“Well?” he snapped. 

I broke a tooth. I’m going 
over to Darius IV tomorrow, with 
Hrom, to have it fixed.” 

“Why Darius IV?” Andy de- 
manded. “What’s the matter with 
Felician dentists?” 

“What’s Hrom going to do with 
boy?” Blahrog demanded. 

“Hrom’s leaving the baby with 
Mrs. Klagom,” Miss Feather- 
penny answered, “and there 
aren’t any Felician dentists.” 

SATISFACTION GUARANTE 


“Mrs. Klagom is a silly 
woman,” Blahrog disapproved. 
“She would do better to leave 
him with me.” 

“If you must, I suppose you 
must,” Andy admitted grudgingly. 
“Where are you going now?” 

“Back to Hrom’s house to lie 
down.” 

“Tell her I’ll mind the baby,” 
Blahrog called after her. 

As she closed the door, she 
heard Andy say, “Gentlemen, if 
you’ll supply the Throatduster, 
I’ll give it a try.” 

£6TT’S awfully quiet,” Hrom 
said doubtfully, looking 
around at the Felician spaceport. 
“Look at the tannery chimneys. 
No smoke.” 

Miss Featherpenny, her mouth 
in good repair, glanced into the 
bar as they passed it. “Only two 
shippers,” she said. “There are 
usually dozens.” 

“They must have stopped pro- 
duction entirely,” Hrom said. 

“Maybe Andy thought of some- 
thing.” ' 

“I wonder if Papa brought the 
car down for us.” 

He hadn’t. They walked into 
town. 

Blahrog was in conference with 
the Everking. 

“I’d better wait for him,” Miss 
Featherpenny said. “I want to 
find out what’s going on before 
I talk to Andy.”

“I’d better rescue Mother 
Klagom from the baby.” 

Blahrog was as long-winded as 
usual. 

“Where is Mr. Stephens?” Miss 
Featherpenny demanded, as soon 
as she saw him coming down the 
hall. 

“In his old store-room,” Blahrog 
said moodily. “He’s quite drunk, 
I believe, but he doesn’t seem to 
be getting any ideas.” 

“Then why did you stop cob- 
bling?” 

Blahrog did a Felician shrug. 
‘We’re waiting to see what hap- 
pens. There’s no sense making 
shoes any more if they aren’t 
wanted.” 

“I have to talk to him,” Miss 
Featherpenny said. 

“Do you have an idea?” 

“No,” Miss Featherpenny lied. 
“But you’d let him drink himself 
to death, if he didn’t think of 
anything.” 

“You want a lift in the car?” 
Blahrog asked, uninsulted. 

“I’d be pleased, if you don’t 
mind. I just walked in from the 
port.” 

A NDY was not, as Blahrog had 
suggested, very drunk. He 
was only hung over. “Get your 
tooth fixed?” he asked cheerlessly. 

“Yes.” 

“Good dentist?” 

Miss Featherpenny nodded. 
“He had some entirely new equip- 

108 


ment. Extremely powerful, and 
quite precise.” 

“Oh?” Andy straightened in 
the old arm chair. “I’ve been 
trying to think. And drinking. 
Throatduster isn’t working this 
time.” He paused to reconsider. 
“Except that it makes me drunk. 
Everything keeps getting fuzzy, 
and my head is wider than my 
shoulders.” 

“The dentist said,” Miss Fea- 
therpenny persisted, “that he 
could pull a whale’s tooth as easily 
and smoothly as he pulled mine.” 
“You had to have it pulled? 
Too bad.” Andy made a face at 
the full mug of Throatduster on 
the barrel beside him. “The Feli- 
cians won’t change their minds 
about the shoes, and they won’t 
try tourists again. I can’t think of 
anything else. And they can claim 
the guarantee. I was bluffing.” 

“I know,” Miss Featherpenny 
said. She tried again. “The dentist 
claims even the tiniest species 
could do dental work on the 
biggest species.” She paused, 
hoping it would sink in. “Provid- 
ing the tiny species had sufficient 
dexterity.” 

“Blasted Felicians,” Andy mut- 
tered. “Stubborn little pigs.” 
“That’s part of their trouble, I 
think,” Miss Featherpenny said. 
“Being little, I mean. But it 
doesn’t always work against them. 
When they’re doing delicate 
work . 

GALAXY 


“Like those shoes,” Andy 
agreed. “ ‘Best possible shapes 
already,’” he imitated Blahrog. 

“They’re one of the smallest 
intelligent species,” Miss Feather- 
penny said in desperation. “And 
their manual dexterity rating is 
one of the highest. Why, a Feli- 
cian could get both hands inside 
an Earther’s mouth.” 

“And steal his fillings . .” 
Andy started. ‘Wait a minute. 
You’ve given me an idea.” 

Miss Featherpenny breathed 
relief. “I have? What is it?” 
“Dentists! They can all be den- 
tists.” 

“All?” 

‘Well, enough of them to pro- 
vide for the planet’s income.” 
‘Why, that’s marvelous,” Miss 
Featherpenny said. “It won’t 
matter that other species think 
they’re cute. Everybody takes 
dentists seriously.” 

“Their appearance will work 
for them,” Andy said. “Think of 
children’s dentistry.” 

“Let’s go tell them right away,” 
Miss Featherpenny said, feeling 
like a Bobbsey twin. 

Andy swayed upward. 

“Sit still,” Miss Featherpenny 
commanded “I’ll bring you some 
coffee.” 

OLAHROG accepted the sug- 
gestion with Felician phlegm 
and ministerial greed. “We’ll have 
to change the tax system, since 

SATISFACTION GUARAN 


most of our working population 
will be living off-planet.” 

“Maybe you could work out a 
rotation system, Papa.” Hrom 
had sneaked into the council 
chamber. 

‘Wait a minute,” Andy said 
uneasily. “How are you going to 
educate these dentists?” 

Blahrog stopped and thought. 
“We’ll use the hotels for schools,” 
he said slowly. His face wrinkled 
with sly pleasure. “And we can 
sell the coal surplus to pay teach- 
ers and buy equipment.” 

The Everking made a wicked- 
sounding comment in Felician. 

The entire assembly burst into 
loud, beard-wagging laughter. It 
had a nasty ring to it. 

‘What did he say?” Andy de- 
manded. 

“He said,” Hrom giggled, “‘Let 
them try to treat us like stuffed 
toys now.’ ” 

“Disgusting,” said Miss Fea- 
therpenny. 

“Indecent, Edie,” Andy agreed. 
“But never mind. Let’s go home 
and get married.” 

“You’re a little sudden.” 

Andy grinned. “I’ll have a 
raise coming for this, and I’d like 
to keep you in the family. I can’t 
seem to think unless you’re 
around.” 

“Took you long enough to no- 
tice,” said Miss Featherpenny. But 
she didn’t say it out loud.

S OFT AS the voice of a 
mourning dove, the tele- 
phone sounded at Rufus 
Sollenar’s desk. Sollenar himself 
was standing fifty paces away, his 
leonine head cocked, his hands 
flat in his hip pockets, watching 
the nighted world through the 
crystal wall that faced out over 
Manhattan Island. The window 
was so high that some of what he 
saw was dimmed by low cloud 
hovering over the rivers. Above 
him were stars; below him the 
city was traced out in light and 
brimming with light. A falling star 
— an interplanetary rocket — 
streaked down toward Long 
Island Facility like a scratch 
across the soot on the doors of 
Hell. 

Sollenar’s eyes took it in, but 
he was watching the total scene, 
not any particular part of it. His 
eyes were shining. 

When he heard the telephone, 
he raised his left hand to his lips. 
“Yes?” The hand glittered with 
utilijem rings; the effect was that 
of an attempt at the sort of cop- 
per-binding that was once used to 
reinforce the ribbing of wooden 
warships. 

His personal receptionist’s 
voice moved from the air near 
'his desk to the air near his ear. 
Seated at the monitor board in 


111 



her office, wherever in this build- 
ing her office was, the reception- 
ist told him: 

“Mr. Ermine says he has an 
appointment.” 

“No.” Sollenar dropped his 
hand and returned to his pano- 
rama. When he had been twenty 
years younger — managing the 
modest optical factory that had 
provided the support of three 
generations of Sollenars — he 
had very much wanted to be able 
to stand in a place like this, and 
feel as he imagined men felt in 
such circumstances. But he felt 
unimaginable, now. 

To be here was one thing. To 
have almost lost the right, and 
regained it at the last moment, 
was another. Now he knew that 
not only could he be here today 
but that tomorrow, and tomorrow, 
he could still be here. He had 
won. His gamble had given him 
EmpaVid — and EmpaVid would 
give him all. 

The city was not merely a prize 
set down before his eyes. It was 
a dynamic system he had proved 
he could manipulate. He and the 
city were one. It buoyed and sus- 
tained him; it supported him, here 
in the air, with stars above and 
light-thickened mist below. 

The telephone mourned: “Mr. 
Ermine states he has a firm ap- 
pointment.” 

“I’ve never heard of him.” And 
the left hand’s utilijems fell from 


Sollenar’s Tips again. He enjoyed 
such toys. He raised his right 
hand, sheathed in insubstantial 
midnight-blue silk in which the 
silver threads of metallic wiring 
ran subtly toward the fingertips. 
He raised the hand, and touched 
two fingers together: music began 
to play behind and before him. 
He made contact between anoth- 
er combination of finger circuits, 
and a soft, feminine laugh came 
from the terrace at the other side 
of the room, where connecting 
doors had opened. He moved 
toward it. One layer of translu- 
cent drapery remained across the 
doorway, billowing lightly in the 
breeze from the terrace. Through 
it, he saw the taboret with its 
candle lit; the iced wine in the 
stand beside it; the two fragile 
chairs; Bess Allardyce, slender 
and regal, waiting in one of them 
— all these, through the misty 
curtain, like either the beginning 
or the end of a dream. 

“Mr. Ermine reminds you the 
appointment was made for him at 
the Annual Business Dinner of 
the International Association of 
Broadcasters, in 1998.” 

Sollenar completed his latest 
step, then stopped. He frowned 
down at his left hand. “Is Mr. 
Ermine with the IAB’s Special 
Public Relations Office?” 

“Yes,” the voice said after a 
pause. 

The fingers of Sollenar’s right 


r 

hand shrank into a cone. The con- 
necting door closed. The girl dis- 
appeared. The music stopped. 
“All right. You can tell Mr. Er- 
mine to come up.” Sollenar went 
to sit behind his desk. 

rpHE office door chimed. Sol- 
l en ar crooked a finger of his 
left hand, and the door opened. 
With another gesture, he kindled 
the overhead lights near the door 
and sat in shadow as Ermine 
came in. 

Ermine was dressed in rust- 
colored garments. His figure was 
spare, and his hands were empty. 
His face was round and soft, with 
long dark sideburns. His scalp 
was bald. He stood just inside 
Sollenar’s office and said: “I 

would like some light to see you 
by, Mr. Sollenar.” 

Sollenar crooked his little 
finger. 

The overhead lights came to 
soft light all over the office. The 
crystal wall became a mirror, with 
only the strongest city lights glim- 
mering through it. “I only wanted 
to see you first,” said Sollenar; 

“I thought perhaps we’d met be- 
fore.” 

“No,” Ermine said, walking 
across the office. “It’s not likely 
you’ve ever seen me.” He took a 
card case out of his pocket and 
showed Sollenar proper identifi- 
cation. “I’m not a very forward 
person.” 


GALAXY 


“Please sit down,” Sollenar 
said. “What may I do for you?” 
“At the moment, Mr. Sollenar, 
I’m doing something for you.” 
Sollenar sat back in his chair. 
“Are you? Are you, now?” He 
frowned at Ermine. “When I be- 
came a party to the By-Laws 
passed at the ’98 Dinner, I 
thought a Special Public Rela- 
tions Office would make a valu- 
able asset to the organization. 
Consequently, I voted for it, and 
for the powers it was given. But 
I never expected to have any 
personal dealings with it. I barely 
remembered you people had carte 
blanche with any IAB member.” 
“Well, of course, it’s been a 
while since ’98,” Ermine said. “I 
imagine some legends have grown 
up around us. Industry gossip — 
that sort of thing.” 

“Yes.” 

“But we don’t restrict our- 
selves to an enforcement function, 
Mr. Sollenar. You haven’t broken 
any By-Laws, to our knowledge.” 
“Or mine. But nobody feels 
one hundred per cent secure. Not 
under these circumstances.” Nor 
did Sollenar yet relax his face 
into its magnificent smile. “I’m 
sure you’ve found that out.” 

“I have a somewhat less ambi- 
tious older brother who’s with the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
When I embarked on my own 
career, he told me I could expect 
everyone in the world to react 


112 


WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE OF NIGHT

like a criminal, yes,” Ermine said, 
paying no attention to Sollenar’s 
involuntary blink. “It’s one of the 
complicating factors in a profes- 
sion like my brother’s, or mine. 
But I’m here to advise you, Mr. 
Sollenar. Only that.” 

“In what matter, Mr. Ermine?” 
“Well, your corporation recent- 
ly came into control of the pat- 
ents for a new video system. I 
understand that this in effect 
makes your corporation the licen- 
sor for an extremely valuable 
sales and entertainment medium. 
Fantastically valuable.” 

UTj'MPAVID,” Sollenar agreed. 

“Various subliminal stimuli 
are broadcast with and keyed to 
the overt subject matter. The 
home receiving unit contains 
feedback sensors which determine 
the viewer’s reaction to these 
stimuli, and intensify some while 
playing down others in order to 
create complete emotional rap- 
port between the viewer and the 
subject matter. EmpaVid, in other 
words, is a system for orchestra- 
ting the viewer’s emotions. The 
home unit is self-contained, semi- 
portable and not significantly 
bulkier than the standard TV re- 
ceiver. EmpaVid is compatible 
with standard TV receivers — 
except, of course, that the subject 
matter seems thin and vaguely 
unsatisfactory on a standard re- 
ceiver. So the consumer shortly 


purchases an EV unit.” It pleased ' 
Sollenar to spell out the nature of 
his prize. 

“At a very reasonable price. 1 
Quite so, Mr. Sollenar. But you 
had several difficulties in finding 
potential licensees for this system, 
among the networks.” 

Sollenar’s lips pinched out. 

Mr. Ermine raised one finger. 
“First, there was the matter of 
acquiring the patents from the 
original inventor, who was also 
approached by Cortwright Burr.” 
“Yes, he was,” Sollenar said in 
a completely new voice. 

“Competition between Mr. 
Burr and yourself is long-stand- 
ing and intense.” 

“Quite intense,” Sollenar said, 
looking directly ahead of him at 
the one blank wall of the office. 
Burr’s offices were several blocks 
downtown, in that direction. 

“Well, I have no wish to enlarge 
on that point, Mr. Burr being an 
IAB member in standing as good 
as yours, Mr. Sollenar. There was, 
in any case, a further difficulty in 
licensing EV,- due to the very 
heavy cost involved in equipping 
broadcasting stations and network 
relay equipment for this sort of 
transmission.” 

“Yes, there was.” 

“Ultimately, however, you suc- 
ceeded. You pointed out, quite 
rightly, that if just one station 
made the change, and if just a 
few EV receivers were put into 

GALAXY 


public places within the area 
served by that station, normal TV 
outlets could not possibly com- 
pete for advertising revenue.” 

“Yes.” 

“And so your last difficulties 
w ere resolved a few days ago, 
when your EmpaVid Unlimited 
. — pardon me; when EmpaVid, a 
subsidiary of the Sollenar Corpo- 
ration — became a major stock- 
holder in the Transworld TV Net- 
work.” 

DON’T understand, Mr. 

-^-Ermine,” Sollenar said. “Why 
are you recounting this? Are you 
trying to demonstrate the power 
of your knowledge? All these 
transactions are already matters 
of record in the IAB confidential 
files, in accordance with the By- 
Laws.” 

Ermine held up another finger. 
“You’re forgetting I’m only here 
to advise you. I have two things 
to say. They are: 

“These transactions are on file 
with the IAB because they in- 
volve a great number of IAB 
members, and an increasingly 
large amount of capital. Also, 
Transworld’s exclusivity, under 
the IAB By-Laws, will hold good 
only until thirty-three per cent 
market saturation has been 
reached. If EV is as good as it 
looks, that will be quite soon. 
After that, under the By-Laws, 
Transworld will be restrained 

WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE 


from making effective defenses 
against patent infringement by 
competitors. Then all of the IAB’s 
membership and much of their 
capital will be involved with EV. 
Much of that capital is already 
in anticipatory motion. So a 
highly complex structure now 
ultimately depends on the integ- 
rity of the Sollenar Corporation. 
If Sollenar stock falls in value, not 
just you but many IAB members 
will be greatly embarrassed. 
Which is another way of saying 
EV must succeed.” 

“I know all that! What of it? 
There’s no risk. I’ve had every 
related patent on Earth checked. 
There will be no catastrophic ob- 
solescence of the EV system.” 

Ermine said: “There are en- 
gineers on Mars. Martian engi- 
neers. They’re a dying race, but 
no one knows what they can still 
do.” 

Sollenar raised his massive 
head. 

Ermine said: “Late this eve- 
ning, my office learned that Cort- 
wright Burr has been in close con- 
sultation with the Martians for 
several weeks. They have made 
some sort of machine for him. He 
was on the flight that landed at 
the Facility a few moments ago.” 

Sollenar’s fists clenched. The 
lights crashed off and on, and the 
room wailed. From the terrace 
came a startled cry, and a sound 
of smashed glass. 

OF NIGHT 115

Mr. Ermine nodded, excused 
himself and left. 

— A few moments later, Mr. 
Ermine stepped out at the pedes- 
trian level of the Sollenar Build- 
ing. He strolled through the land- 
scaped garden, and across the 
frothing brook toward the central 
walkway down the Avenue. He 
paused at a hedge to pluck a 
blossom and inhale its odor. He 
walked away, holding it in his 
naked fingers. 


II 


D rifting slowly on the 

thread of his spinneret, Rufus 


Sollenar came gliding down the 
wind above Cortwright Burr’s 
building. 

The building, like a spider, 
touched the ground at only the 
points of its legs. It held its wide, 
low bulk spread like a parasol 
over several downtown blocks. 
Sollenar, manipulating the heli- 
um-filled plastic drifter far above 
him, steered himself with jets of 
compressed gas from plastic bot- 
tles in the drifter’s structure. 

Only Sollenar himself, in all 
this system, was not effectively 
transparent to the municipal anti- 
plane radar. And he himself was 
wrapped in long, fluttering 
streamers of dull black, metallic 
sheeting. To the eye, he was 
amorphous and non-reflective. To 
electronic sensors, he was a drift 


of static much like a sheet of foil 
picked by the wind from some 
careless trash heap. To all of the 
senses of all interested parties he 
was hardly there at all — and, 
thus, in an excellent position for 
murder. 

He fluttered against Burr’s 
window. There was the man, 
crouched over his desk. What was 
that in his hands — a pomander? 

Sollenar clipped his harness to 
the edges of the cornice. Swayed 
out against it, his sponge-soled 
boots pressed to the glass, he 
touched his left hand to the win- 
dow and described a circle. He 
pushed; there was a thud on 
the carpeting in Burr’s office, and 
now there was no barrier to Sol- 
lenar. Doubling his knees against 
his chest, he catapulted forward, 
the riot pistol in his right hand. 
He stumbled and fell to his knees, 
but the gun was up. 

Burr jolted up behind his desk. 
The little sphere of orange-gold 
metal, streaked with darker 
bronze, its surface vermicular 
with encrustations, was still in 
his hands. “Him!” Burr cried out 
as Sollenar fired. 

Gasping, Sollenar watched the 
charge strike Burr. It threw his 
torso backward faster than his 
limbs and head could follow with- 
out dangling. The choked-down 
pistol was nearly silent. Burr 
crashed backward to end, trans- 
fixed, against the wall. 



TJALE and sick, Sollenar moved 
* to take the golden ball. He 
wondered where 


116 


GALAXY 


Shakespeare 
could have seen an example such 
as this, to know an old man could 
have so much blood in him. 

Burr held the prize out to him. 
Staring with eyes distended by 
hydrostatic pressure, his clothing 
raddled and his torso grinding its 
broken bones, Burr stalked away 
from the wall and moved as if 
to embrace Sollenar. It was queer, 
but he was not dead. 

Shuddering, Sollenar fired 
again. 

Again Burr was thrown back. 
The ball spun from his splayed 
fingers as he once more marked 
the wall with his body. 

Pomander, orange, whatever — 
it looked valuable. 

Sollenar ran after the rolling 
ball. And Burr moved to inter- 
cept him, nearly faceless, hunched 
under a great invisible weight that 
slowly yielded as his back 
groaned. 

Sollenar took a single back- 
ward step. 

Burr took a step toward him. 
The golden ball lay in a far 
corner. Sollenar raised the pistol 
despairingly and fired again. Burr 
tripped backward on tiptoe, his 
arms like windmills, and fell atop 
the prize. 

Tears ran down Sollenar’s 
cheeks. He pushed one foot for- 
ward . and Burr, in his corner, 


lifted his head and began to 
gather his body for the effort of 
rising. 

Sollenar retreated to the win- 
dow, the pistol sledging back- 
ward against his wrist and elbow 
as he fired the remaining shots in 
the magazine. 

Panting, he climbed up into the 
window frame and clipped the 
harness to his body, craning to 
look over his shoulder ... as Burr 
— shredded; leaking blood and 
worse than blood — advanced 
across the office. 

He cast off his holds on the 
window frame and clumsily 
worked the drifter controls. Far 
above him, volatile ballast spilled 
out and dispersed in the air long 
before it touched ground. Sollenar 
rose, sobbing — 

And Burr stood in the window, 
his shattered hands on the edges 
of the cut circle, raising his dis- 
tended eyes steadily to watch 
Sollenar in flight across the enig- 
matic sky. 


ILW/TIERE he landed, on the 
” roof of a building in his 
possession, Sollenar had a disposal 
unit for his gun and his other 
trappings. He deferred for a time 
the question of why Burr had 
failed at once to die. Empty- 
handed, he returned uptown. 

He entered his office, called 
and told his attorneys the exact 
times of departure and return and 


WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE OF NIGHT 


117 


knew the question of dealing with 
municipal authorities was thereby 
resolved. That was simple enough, 
with no witnesses to complicate 
the matter. He began to wish he 
hadn’t been so irresolute as to 
leave Burr without the thing he 
was after. Surely, if the pistol 
hadn’t killed the man — an old 
man, with thin limbs and spotted 
skin — he could have wrestled 
that thin-limbed, bloody old man 
aside — that spotted old man — 
and dragged himself and his prize 
back to the window, for all that 
the old man would have clung to 
him, and clutched at his legs, and 
fumbled for a handhold on his 
somber disguise of wrappings — 
that broken, immortal old man. 

Sollenar raised his hand. The 
great window to the city grew 
opaque. 

Bess Allardyce knocked softly 
on the door from the terrace. He 
would have thought she’d re- 
turned to her own apartments 
many hours ago. Tortuously 
pleased, he opened the door and 
smiled at her, feeling the dried 
tears crack on the skin of his 
cheeks. 

He took her proffered hands. 
“You waited for me,” he sighed. 
“A long time for anyone as beau- 
tiful as you to wait.” 

She smiled back at him. “Let’s 
go out and look at the stars.” 

“Isn’t it chilly?” 

“I made spiced hot cider for us. 

118 


We can sip it and think.” 

He let her draw him out onto 
the terrace. He leaned on the 
parapet, his arm around her puls- 
ing waist, his cape drawn around 
both their shoulders. 

“Bess, I won’t ask if you’d stay 
with me no matter what the cir- 
cumstances. But it might be a 
time will come when I couldn’t 
bear to live in this city. What 
about that?” 

“I don’t know,” she answered 
honestly. 

And Cortwright Burr put his 
hand up over the edge of the par- 
apet, between them. 

S OLLENAR stared down at the 
straining knuckles, holding the 
entire weight of the man dangling 
against the sheer face of the 
building. There was a sliding, 
rustling noise, and the other hand 
came up, searched blindly for a 
hold and found it, hooked over 
the stone. The fingers tensed and 
rose, their tips flattening at the 
pressure as Burr tried to pull his 
head and shoulders up to the 
level of the parapet. 

Bess breathed:' “Oh, look at 
them! He must have torn them 
terribly climbing up!” Then she 
pulled away from Sollenar and 
stood staring at him, her hand to 
her mouth. “But he couldn’t have 
climbed! We’re so high!” 

Sollenar beat at the hands with 
the heels of his palms, using the 

GALAXY 


direct, trained blows he had 
learned at his athletic club. 

Bone splintered against the 
stone. When the knuckles were 
broken the hands instantaneously 
disappeared, leaving only streaks 
behind them. Sollenar looked over 
the parapet. A bundle shrank 
from sight, silhouetted against the 
lights of the pedestrian level and 
the Avenue. It contracted to a 
pinpoint. Then, when it reached 
the brook and water flew in all 
directions, it disappeared in a 
final sunburst, endowed with 
glory by the many lights which 
found momentary reflection down 
there. 

“Bess, leave me! Leave me, 
please!” Rufus Sollenar cried out. 

Ill 

T>UFUS Sollenar paced his of- 
•*-*- fice, his hands held safely still 
in front of him, their fingers 
spread and rigid. 

The telephone sounded, and his 
secretary said to him: “Mr. Sol- 
lenar, you are ten minutes from 
being late at the TTV Executives’ 
Ball. This is a First Class obliga- 
tion.” 

Sollenar laughed. “I thought it 
was, when I originally classified 
it.” 

“Are you now planning to re- 
nege, Mr. Sollenar?” the secretary 
inquired politely. 

Certainly, Sollenar thought. He 

WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE 


could as easily renege on the Ball 
as a king could on his coronation. 

“Burr, you scum, what have 
you done to me?” he asked the 
air, and the telephone said: “Beg 
pardon?” 

“Tell my valet,” Sollenar said. 
“I’m going.” He dismissed the 
phone. His hands cupped in front 
of his chest. A firm grip on empti- 
ness might be stronger than any 
prize in a broken hand. 

Carrying in his chest something • 
he refused to admit was terror, 
Sollenar made ready for the Ball. 

But only a few moments after 
the first dance set had ended. 
Malcolm Levier of the local TTV 
station executive staff looked 
over Sollenar’s shoulder and re- 
marked: 

“Oh, there’s Cort Burr, dressed 
like a gallows bird.” 

Sollenar, glittering in the cos- 
tume of the Medici, did not turn 
his head. “Is he? What would he 
want here?” 

Levier’s eyebrows arched. “He 
holds a little stock. He has entree. 
But he’s late.” Levier’s lips 
quirked. “It must have taken him 
some time to get that makeup on.” 
“Not in good taste, is it?” 

“Look for yourself.” 

“Oh, I’ll do better than that,” 
Sollenar said. “I’ll go and talk to 
him a while. Excuse me, Levier.” 
And only then did he turn around, 
already started on his first pace 
toward the man. 

OF NIGHT 119 


T>UT Cortwright Burr was only 
a pasteboard imitation of 
himself as Sollenar had come to 
know him. He stood to one side of 
the doorway, dressed in black and 
crimson robes, with black leather 
gauntlets on his hands, carrying 
a staff of weathered, natural 
wood. His face was shadowed by 
a sackcloth hood, the eyes well 
hidden. His face was powdered 
gray, and some blend of livid col- 
ors hollowed his cheeks. He stood 
motionless as Sollenar came up to 
him. 

As he had crossed the floor, 
each step regular, the eyes of by- 
standers had followed Sollenar, 
until, anticipating his course, they 
found Burr waiting. The noise 
level of the Ball shrank percept- 
ibly, for the lesser revelers who 
chanced to be present were sus- 
taining it all alone. The people 
who really mattered here were 
silent and watchful. 

The thought was that Burr, de- 
feated in business, had come here 
in some insane reproach to his 
adversary, in this lugubrious, dis- 
tasteful clothing. Why, he looked 
like a corpse. Or worse. 

The question was, what would 
Sollenar say to him? The wish 
was that Burr would take himself 
away, back to his estates or to 
some other city. New York was no 
longer for Cortwright Burr. But 
what would Sollenar say to him 
now, to drive him back to where 


he hadn’t the grace to go will- 
ingly? 

“Cortwright,” Sollenar said in 
a voice confined to the two of 
them. “So your Martian immor- 
tality works.” 

Burr said nothing. 

“You got that in addition, 
didn’t you? You knew how I’d re- 
act. You knew you’d need pro- 
tection. Paid the Martians to 
make you physically invulner- 
able? It’s a good system. Very 
impressive. Who would have 
thought the Martians knew so 
much? But who here is going to 
pay attention to you now? Get 
out of town, Cortwright. You’re 
past your chance. You’re dead as 
far as these people are concerned 

— all you have left is your skin.” 

Burr repched up and surrepti- 
tiously lifted a corner of his 
fleshed mask. And there he was, 
under it. The hood retreated an 
inch, and the light reached his 
eyes; and Sollenar had been 
wrong, Burr had less left than he 
thought. 

“Oh, no, no, Cortwright,” Solle- 
nar said softly. “No, you’re right 

— I can’t stand up to that.” 

He turned and bowed to the as- 
sembled company. “Good night!” 
he cried, and walked out of the 
ballroom. 

Someone followed him down 
the corridor to the elevators. 
Sollenar did not look behind him. 

“I have another appointment 


120 


GALAXY 



with you now,” Ermine said at 
his elbow. 

T HEY reached the pedestrian 
level. Sollenar said: “There’s 
a cafe. We can talk there.” 

“Too public, Mr. Sollenar. Let’s 
simply stroll and converse.” Er- 
mine lightly took his arm and 
guided him along the walkway. 
Sollenar noticed then that Er- 
mine was costumed so cunningly 
that no one could have guessed 
the appearance of the man. 

“Very well,” Sollenar said. 

“Of course.” 

They walked together, casu- 
ally. Ermine said: “Burr’s driving 
you to your death. Is it because 
you tried to kill him earlier? Did 
you get his Martian secret?” 
Sollenar shook his head. 

“You didn’t get it.” Ermine 
sighed. “That’s unfortunate. I’ll 
have to take steps.” 

“Under the By-Laws,” Sollenar 
said, “I cry laissez faire.” 

Ermine looked up, his eyes 
twinkling. “Laissez faire? Mr. Sol- 
lenar, do you have any idea how 
many of our members are in- 
volved in your fortunes? They 
will cry laissez faire, Mr. Sollenar, 
but clearly you persist in drag- 
ging them down with you. No, sir, 
Mr. Sollenar, my office now for- 
wards an immediate recommenda- 
tion to the Technical Advisory 
Committee of the IAB that Mr. 
Burr probably has a system 


superior to yours, and that stock 
in Sollenar, Incorporated, had 
best be disposed of.” 

“There’s a bench,” Sollenar 
said. “Let’s sit down.” 

“As you wish.” Ermine moved 
beside Sollenar to the bench, but 
remained standing. 

“What is it, Mr. Sollenar?” 

“I want your help. You advised 
me on what Burr had. It’s still 
in his office building, somewhere. 
You have resoures. We can get 
it.” 

“Laissez faire, Mr. Sollenar. I 
visited you in an advisory capa- 
city. I can do no more.” 

“For a partnership in my af- 
fairs could you do more?” 

“Money?” Ermine tittered. 
“For me? Do you know the con- 
ditions of my employment?” 

TF HE had thought, Sollenar 
would have remembered. He 
reached out tentatively. Ermine 
anticipated him. 

Ermine bared his left arm and 
sank his teeth into it. He dis- 
played the arm. There was no 
quiver of pain in voice or stance. 
“It’s not a legend, Mr. Sollenar. 
It’s quite true. We of our office 
must spend a year, after the nerve 
surgery, learning to walk without 
the feel of our feet, to handle ob- 
jects without crushing them or 
letting them slip, or damaging 
ourselves. Our mundane pleasures 
are auditory, olfactory, and visual.

Easily gratified at little expense. 
Our dreams are totally interior, 
Mr. Sollenar. The operation is 
irreversible. What would you buy 
for me with your money?” 

“What would I buy for my- 
self?” Sollenar’s head sank down 
between his shoulders. 

Ermine bent over him. “Your 
despair is your own, Mr. Sollenar. 

I have official business with you.” 
He lifted Sollenar’s chin with 
a forefinger. “I judge physical in- 
terference to be unwarranted at 
this time. But matters must 
remain so that the IAB members 
involved with you can recover 
the value of their investments in 
EV. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. 
Sollenar? You are hereby en- 
joined under the By-Laws, as 
enforced by the Special Public 
Relations Office.” He glanced at 
his watch. “Notice was served at 
1:27 AM, City time.” 

“1:27,” Sollenar said. “City 
time.” He sprang to his feet and 
raced down a companionway to 
the taxi level. 

Mr. Ermine watched him quiz- 
zically. 

He opened his costume, took 
out his omnipresent medical kit, 
and sprayed coagulant over the 
wound in his forearm. Replacing 
the kit, he adjusted his clothing 
and strolled down the same com- 
panionway Sollenar had run. He 
raised an arm, and a taxi flittered 
down beside him. He showed the 


driver a card, and the cab lifted 
off with him, its lights glaring in 
a Priority pattern, far faster than 
Sollenar’s ordinary legal limit 
allowed.

L ONG Island Facility vaulted 
at the stars in great kangaroo- 
leaps of arch and cantilever span, 
jeweled in glass and metal as 
if the entire port were a mecha- 
nism for navigating interplane- 
tary space. Rufus Sollenar paced 
its esplanades, measuring his 
steps, holding his arms still, for 
the short time until he could 
board the Mars rocket. 

Erect and majestic, he took a 
place in the lounge and carefully 
sipped liqueur, once the liner had 
boosted away from Earth and 
coupled in its Faraday main 
drives. 

Mr. Ermine settled into the 
place beside him. 

Sollenar looked over at him 
calmly. “I thought so.” 

Ermine nodded. “Of course you 
did. But I didn’t almost miss you. 
I was here ahead of you. I have 
no objection to your going to 
Mars, Mr. Sollenar. Laissez faire. 
Provided I can go along.” 

“Well,” Rufus Sollenar said. 
“Liqueur?” He gestured with his 
glass. 

Ermine shook his head. “No, 
thank you,” he said delicately.

Sollenar said: “Even your 

tongue?” 

“Of course my tongue, Mr. Sol- 
lenar. I taste nothing. I touch 
nothing.” Ermine smiled. “But I 
feel no pressure.” 

“All right, then,” Rufus Sol- 
lenar said crisply. “We have sev- 
eral hours to landing time. You 
sit and dream your interior 
dreams, and I’ll dream mine.” He 
faced around in his chair and 
folded his arms across his chest. 

“Mr. Sollenar,” Ermine said 
gently. 

“Yes?” 

“I am once again with you by 
appointment as provided under 
the By-Laws.” 

“State your business, Mr. Er- 
mine.” 

“You are not permitted to lie 
in an unknown grave, Mr. Sol- 
lenar. Insurance policies on your 
life have been taken out at a high 
premium rate. The IAB members 
concerned cannot wait the statu- 
tory seven years to have you 
declared dead. Do what you will, 
Mr. Sollenar, but I must take care 
I witness your death. From now 
on, I am with you wherever you 
go.” 

Sollenar smiled. “I don’t intend 
to die. Why should I die, Mr. 
Ermine?” 

“I have no idea, Mr. Sollenar. 
But I know Cortwright Burr’s 
character. And isn’t that he, 
seated there in the corner? The 


light is poor, but I think he’s rec- 
ognizable.” 

Across the lounge, Burr raised 
his head and looked into Sollen- 
ar’s eyes. He raised a hand near 
his face, perhaps merely to signify 
greeting. Rufus Sollenar faced 
front. 

“A worthy opponent, Mr. Sol- 
lenar,” Ermine said. “A persever- 
ing, unforgiving, ingenious man. 
And yet — ” Ermine seemed a lit- 
tle touched by bafflement. “And 
yet it seems to me, Mr. Sollenar, 
that he got you running rather 
easily. What did happen between 
you, after my advisory call?” 

Sollenar turned a terrible smile 
on Ermine. “I shot him to pieces. 
If you’d peel his face, you’d see.” 

Ermine sighed. “Up to this 
moment, I had thought perhaps 
you might still salvage your 
affairs.” 

“Pity, Mr. Ermine? Pity for 
the insane?” 

“Interest. I can take no part in 
your world. Be grateful, Mr. Sol- 
lenar. I am not the same gullible 
man I was when I signed my con- 
tract with IAB, so many years 
ago.” 

Sollenar laughed. Then he stole 
a glance at Burr’s corner.

buildings huddled, but huddled 
proudly, at the desert’s edge. 

Low on the horizon was the 
Martian settlement — the build- 
ings so skillfully blended with the 
landscape, so eroded, so much 
abandoned that the uninformed 
eye saw nothing. Sollenar had 
been to Mars — on a tour. He had 
seen the natives in their nameless 
dwelling place; arrogant, venom- 
ous and weak. He had been told, 
by the paid guide, they trafficked 
with Earthmen as much as they 
cared to, and kept to their place 
on the rim of Earth’s encroach- 
ment, observing. 

“Tell me, Ermine,” Sollenar 
said quietly as they walked across 
the terminal lobby. “You’re to kill 
me, aren’t you, if I try to go on 
without you?” 

“A matter of procedure, Mr. 
Sollenar,” Ermine said evenly. 
“We cannot risk the investment 
capital of so many IAB members.” 
Sollenar sighed. “If I were any 
other member, how I would com- 
mend you, Mr. Ermine! Can we 
hire a car for ourselves, then, 
somewhere nearby?” 

“Going out to see the engi- 
neers?” Ermine asked. “Who 
would have thought they’d have 
something valuable for sale?” 

“I want to show them some- 
thing,” Sollenar said. 

“What thing, Mr. Sollenar?” 
They turned the corner of a 
corridor, with branching hallways 


here and there, not all of them 
busy. “Come here,” Sollenar said, 
nodding toward one of them. 

They stopped out of sight of 
the lobby and the main corridor. 
“Come on,” Sollenar said. “A lit- 
tle further.” 

“No,” Ermine said. “This is 
farther than I really wish. It’s 
dark here.” 

“Wise too late, Mr. Ermine,” 
Sollenar said, his arms flashing 
out. 

One palm impacted against 
Ermine’s solar plexus, and the 
other against the muscle at the 
side of his neck, but not hard 
enough to kill. Ermine collapsed, 
starved for oxygen, while Sollen- 
ar silently cursed having been 
cured of murder. Then Sollenar 
turned and ran. 

Behind him Ermine’s body 
struggled to draw breath by re- 
flex alone. 

Moving as fast as he dared, 
Sollenar walked back and 
reached the taxi lock, pulling a 
respirator from a wall rack as he 
went. He flagged a car and gave 
his destination, looking behind 
him. He had seen nothing of Cort- 
wright Burr since setting foot on 
Mars. But he knew that soon or 
late, Burr would find him. 

A few moments later Ermine 
got to his feet. Sollenar’s car was 
well away. Ermine shrugged and 
went to the local broadcasting 
station. 


WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE OF NIGHT

He commandeered a private 
desk, a firearm and immediate 
time on the IAB interoffice circuit 
to Earth. When his call acknowl- 
edgement had come back to him 
from his office there, he reported: 

“Sollenar is enroute to the Mar- 
tian city. He wants a duplicate 
of Burr’s device, of course, since 
he smashed the original when he 
killed Burr. I’ll follow and make 
final disposition. The disorienta- 
tion I reported previously is pro- 
gressing rapidly. Almost all his 
responses now are inappropriate. 
On the flight out, he seemed to 
be staring at something in an 
empty seat. Quite often when 
spoken to he obviously hears 
something else entirely. I expect 
to catch one of the next few flights 
back.” 

There was no point in waiting 
for comment to wend its way 
back from Earth. Ermine left. He 
went to a cab rank and paid the 
exorbitant fee for transportation 
outside Aresian city limits. 

/''’LOSE at hand, the Martian 
^ city was like a welter of 
broken pots. Shards of wall and 
roof joined at savage angles and 
pointed to nothing. Underfoot, 
drifts of vitreous material, shaped 
to fit no sane configuration, and 
broken to fit such a mosaic as no 
church would contain, rocked and 
slid under Sollenar’s hurrying 
feet. 


What from Aresia had been a 
solid front of dun color was here 
a facade of red, green and blue 
splashed about centuries ago and 
since then weathered only enough 
to show how bitter the colors had 
once been. The plum-colored sky 
stretched over all this like a frigid 
membrane, and the wind blew 
and blew. 

Here and there, as he pro- 
gressed, Sollenar saw Martian 
arms and heads protruding from 
the rubble. Sculptures. 

He was moving toward the 
heart of the city, where some few 
unbroken structures persisted. At 
the top of a heap of shards he 
turned to look behind him. There 
was the dust-plume of his cab, re- 
turning to the city. He expected 
to walk back — perhaps to meet 
someone on the road, all alone on 
the Martian plain if only Ermine 
would forebear from interfering. 
Searching the flat, thin-aired 
landscape, he tried to pick out 
the plodding dot of Cortwright 
Burr. But not yet. 

He turned and ran down the 
untrustworthy slope. 

He reached the edge of the 
maintained area. Here the rubble 
was gone, the ancient walks 
swept, the statues kept upright on 
their pediments. But only broken 
walls suggested the fronts of the 
houses that had stood here. Knif- 
ing their sides up through the 
wind-rippled sand that only con-

GALAXY 


stant care kept off the street, the 
shadow-houses fenced his way 
and the sculptures were motion- 
less as hope. Ahead of him, he saw 
the buildings of the engineers. 
There was no heap to climb and 
look to see if Ermine followed 
close behind. 

Sucking his respirator, he 
reached the building of the Mar- 
tian engineers. 

A sounding strip ran down the 
doorjamb. He scratched his fin- 
gernails sharply along it, and the 
magnified vibration, ducted 
throughout the hollow walls, 
rattled his plea for entrance. 

V 

^T'HE door opened, and Mar- 
tians stood looking. They 
were spindly-limbed and slight, 
their faces framed by folds of 
leathery tissue. Their mouths 
were lipped with horn as hard as 
dentures, and pursed, forever 
ready to masticate. They were 
pleasant neither to look at nor, 
Sollenar knew, to deal with. But 
Cortwright Burr had done it. And 
Sollenar needed to do it. 

“Does anyone here speak Eng- 
lish?” he asked. 

“I,” said the central Martian, 
his mouth opening to the sound, 
closing to end the reply. 

“I would like to deal with you.” 

“Whenever,” the Martian said, 
and the group at the doorway 


parted deliberately to let Sollenar 
in. 

Before the door closed behind 
him, Sollenar looked back. But 
the rubble of the abandoned sec- 
tors blocked his line of sight into 
the desert. 

“What can you offer? And what 
do you want?” the Martian asked. 
Sollenar stood half-ringed by 
them, in a room whose corners 
he could not see in the uncertain 
light. 

“I offer you Terrestrial cur- 
rency.” 

The English-speaking Martian 
— the Martian who had admitted 
to speaking English — turned his 
head slightly and spoke to his 
fellows. There were clacking 
sounds as his lips met. The others 
reacted variously, one of them 
suddenly gesturing with what 
seemed a disgusted flip of his arm 
before he turned without further 
word and stalked away, his 
shoulders looking like the 
shawled back of a very old and 
very hungry woman. 

“What did Burr give you?” Sol- 
lenar asked. 

“Burr.” The Martian cocked 
his head. His eyes were not 
multi-faceted, but gave that im- 
pression. 

“He was here and he dealt with 
you. Not long ago. On what 
basis?” 

“Burr. Yes. Burr gave us cur- 
rency. We will take currency 


WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE OF NIGHT 


127 


from you. For the same thing we 
gave him?” 

“For immortality, yes.” 

“Im — This is a new word.” 

“Is it? For the secret of not 
dying?” 

“Not dying? You think we 
have not-dying for sale here?” 
The Martian spoke to the others 
again. Their lips clattered. Others 
left, like the first one had, moving 
with great precision and very 
slow step, and no remaining tol- 
erance for Sollenar. 

Sollenar cried out: “What did 
you sell him, then?” 

The principal engineer said: 
“We made an entertainment de- 
vice for him.” 

“A little thing. This size.” Sol- 
lenar cupped his hands. 

“You have seen it, then.” 
“Yes. And nothing more? That 
was all he bought here?” 

“It was all we had to sell — or 
give. We don’t yet know whether 
Earthmen will give us things in 
exchange for currency. We’ll see, 
when we next need something 
from Aresia.” 

Sollenar demanded: “How did 
it work? This thing you sold him.” 
“Oh, it lets people tell stories 
to themselves.” 

Sollenar looked closely at the 
Martian. “What kind of stories?” 
“Any kind,” the Martian said 
blandly. “Burr told us what he 
wanted. He had drawings with 
him of an Earthman device that 


used pictures on a screen, and 
broadcast sounds, to carry the de- 
tails of the story told to the au- 
ditor.” 

“He stole those patents! He 
couldn’t have used them on 
Earth.” 

Ci A ND why should he? Our 
device needs to convey no 
precise details. Any mind can 
make its own. It only needs to be 
put into a situation, and from 
there it can do all the work. If an 
auditor wishes a story of contact 
with other sexes, for example, the 
projector simply makes it seem to 
him, the next time he is with the 
object of his desire, that he is get- 
ting positive feedback — that he 
is arousing a similar response in 
that object. Once that has been 
established for him, the auditor 
may then leave the machine, 
move about normally, conduct his 
life as usual — but always in 
accordance with the basic situa- 
tion. It is, you see, in the end a 
means of introducing system into 
his view of reality. Of course, his 
society must understand that he 
is not in accord with reality, for 
some of what he does cannot 
seem rational from an outside 
view of him. So some care must 
be taken, but not much. If many 
such devices were to enter his 
society, soon the circumstances 
would become commonplace, and 
the society would surely read- 


128

just to allow for it,” said the 
English-speaking Martian. 

“The machine creates any de- 
sired situation in the auditor’s 
mind?” 

“Certainly. There are simple 
predisposing tapes that can be 
inserted as desired. Love, adven- 
ture, cerebration — it makes no 
difference.” 

Several of the bystanders 
clacked sounds out to each other. 
Sollenar looked at them narrowly. 
It was obvious there had to be 
more than one English-speaker 
among these people. 

“And the device you gave 
Burr,” he asked the engineer, 
neither calmly nor hopefully. 
“What sort of stories could its 
auditors tell themselves?” 

T^HE Martian cocked his head 
again. It gave him the look of 
an owl at a bedroom window. “Oh, 
there was one situation we were 
particularly instructed to include. 
Burr said he was thinking ahead 
to showing it to an acquaintance 
of his. 

“It was a situation of adven- 
ture; of adventure with the fear- 
ful. And it was to end in loss and 
bitterness.” The Martian looked 
even more closely at Sollenar. “Of 
course, the device does not speci- 
fy details. No one but the auditor 
can know what fearful thing in- 
habits his story, or precisely how 
the end of it would come. You 


would, I believe, be Rufus Sollen- 
ar? Burr spoke of you and made 
the noise of laughing.” 

Sollenar opened his mouth. 
But there was nothing to say. 

“You want such a device?” the 
Martian asked. “We’ve prepared 
several since Burr left. He spoke 
of machines that would manufac- 
ture them in astronomical num- 
bers. We, of course, have done 
our best with our poor hands.” 
Sollenar said: “I would like to 
look out your door.” 

“Pleasure.” 

Sollenar opened the door slight- 
ly. Mr. Ermine stood in the 
cleared street, motionless as the 
shadow buildings behind him. He 
raised one hand in a gesture of 
unfelt greeting as he saw Sollenar, 
then put it back on the stock of 
his rifle. Sollenar closed the door, 
and turned to the Martian. “How 
much currency do you want?” 
“Oh, all you have with you. 
You people always have a good 
deal with you when you travel.” 
Sollenar plunged his hands 
into his pockets and pulled out 
his billfold, his change, his keys, 
his jeweled radio; whatever was 
there, he rummaged out onto the 
floor, listening to the sound of 
rolling coins. 

“I wish I had more here,” he 
laughed. “I wish I had the amount 
that man out there is going to 
recover when he shoots me.” 
The Martian engineer cocked 


Wall of crystal, eye of night 


129 


his head. “But your dream is 
over, Mr. Sollenar,” he clacked 
drily. “Isn’t it?” 

“Quite so. But you to your 
purposes and I to mine. Now give 
me one of those projectors. And 
set it to predispose a situation I 
am about to specify to you. Take 
however long it needs. The audi- 
ence is a patient one.” He 
laughed, and tears gathered in 
his eyes. 

T%/|"R. Ermine waited, isolated 
from the cold, listening to 
hear whether the rifle stock was 
slipping out of his fingers. He 
had no desire to go into the Mar- 
tian building after Sollenar and 
involve third parties. All he 
wanted was to put Sollenar’s 
body under a dated marker, with 
as little trouble as possible. 

Now and then he walked a few 
paces backward and forward, to 
keep from losing muscular control 
at his extremities because of low 
skin temperature. Sollenar must 
come out soon enough. He had no 
food supply with him, and though 
Ermine did not like the risk of 
engaging a man like Sollenar in 
a starvation contest, there was no 
doubt that a man with no taste 
for fuel could outlast one with the 
acquired reflexes of eating. 

The door opened and Sollenar 
came out. 

He was carrying something. 
Perhaps a weapon. Ermine let 


him come closer while he raised 
and carefully sighted his rifle. Sol- 
lenar might have some Martian 
weapon or he might not. Ermine 
did not particularly care. If Er- 
mine died, he would hardly notice 
it — far less than he would notice 
a botched ending to a job of work 
already roiled by Sollenar’s break 
away at the space field. If Ermine 
died, some other SPRO agent 
would be assigned almost immedi- 
ately. No matter what happened, 
SPRO would stop Sollenar before 
he ever reached Abernathy Field. 

So there was plenty of time to 
aim an unhurried, clean shot. 

Sollenar was closer, now. He 
seemed to be in a very agitated 
frame of mind. He held out what- 
ever he had in his hand. 

It was another one of the Mar- 
tian entertainment machines. Sol- 
lenar seemed to be offering it as 
a token to Ermine. Ermine smiled. 

“What can you offer me, Mr. 
Sollenar?” he said, and shot. 

The golden ball rolled away 
over the sand. “There, now,” Er- 
mine said. “Now, wouldn’t you 
sooner be me than you? And 
where is the thing that made the 
difference between us?” 

He shivered. He was chilly. 
Sand was blowing against his 
tender face, which had been some- 
what abraded during his long 
wait. 

He stopped, transfixed. 

He lifted his head. 


130 


GALAXY 


Then, with a great swing of his 
arms, he sent the rifle whirling 
away. “The wind!” he sighed into 
the thin air. “I feel the wind.” He 
leapt into the air, and sand flew 
away from his feet as he landed. 
He whispered to himself: “I feel 
the ground!” 

He stared in tremblant joy at 
Sollenar’s empty body. “What 
have you given me?” Full of his 
own rebirth, he swung his head up 
at the sky again, and cried in the 
direction of the Sun: “Oh, you 
squeezing, nibbling people who 
made me incorruptible and 
thought that was the end of me!” 

With love he buried Sollenar, 
and with reverence he put up the 
marker, but he had plans for what 
he might accomplish with the 
facts of this transaction, and the 
myriad others he was privy to. 

A sharp bit of pottery had pen- 
etrated the sole of his shoe and 
gashed his foot, but he, not having 
seen it, hadn’t felt it. Nor would 
he see it or feel it even when he 
changed his stockings; for he had 
not noticed the wound when it 
was made. It didn’t matter. In a 
few days it would heal, though 
not as rapidly as if it had been 
properly attended to. 

Vaguely, he heard the sound of 
Martians clacking behind their 
closed door as he hurried out of 
the city, full of revenge, and rev- 
erence for his savior.

Meet Higgston Rainbird, who

RAINBIHD 

By R. A. LAFFERTY 

Illustrated by WALKER 

W ERE scientific firsts 
truly tabulated the 
name of the Yankee in- 
ventor, Higgston Rainbird, would 
surely be without peer. Yet today 
he is known (and only to a few 
specialists, at that) for an im- 
proved blacksmith’s bellows in 
the year 1785, for a certain modi- 
fication (not fundamental) in the 
moldboard plow about 1805, for a 
better (but not good) method of

Wedge for splitting logs, and for

new safety feature; this last was 
either in the year 1816 or 1817. 
He is known for such, and for no 
more. 

Were this all that he had 
achieved his name would still be 
secure. And it is secure, in a 
limited way, and to those who 
hobby in technological history. 

But the glory of which history 
has cheated him, or of which he 
cheated himself, is otherwise. In 
a different sense, it is without 
parallel, absolutely unique. 

For he pioneered the dynamo, 
the steam automobile, the steel 
industry, ferro-concrete construc- 
tion, the internal combustion en- 
gine, electric illumination and 
power, the wireless, the televox, 
the petroleum and petro-chemi- 
cal industries, monorail transpor- 
tation, air travel, world-wide 
monitoring, fissionable power, 
space travel, group telepathy, 
political and economic balance; 
he built a retrogressor; and he 
made great advances towards 
corporeal immortality and the 
apotheosis of mankind. It would 
seem unfair that all this is un- 
known of him. 

Even the once-solid facts — that 
he wired Philadelphia for light 
and power in 1799, Boston the 
following year and New York 
two years later — are no longer 
solid. In a sense they are no 
longer facts. 

For all this there must be an 


explanation; and if not that, then 
an account at least; and if not 
that, well — something anyhow. 

UTGGSTON RAINBIRD 
made a certain decision on 
a June afternoon in 1779 when 
he was quite a young man, and 
by this decision he confirmed his 
inventive bent. 

He was hawking from the top 
of Devil’s Head Mountain. He 
flew his falcon (actually a tercel 
hawk) down through the white 
clouds, and to him it was the 
highest sport in the world. The 
bird came back, climbing the blue 
air, and brought a passenger 
pigeon from below the clouds. 
And Higgston was almost per- 
fectly happy as he hooded the 
hawk. 

He could stay there all day 
and hawk from above the clouds. 
Or he could go down the moun- 
tain and work on his sparker in 
his shed. He sighed as he made 
the decision, for no man can have 
everything. There was a fascina- 
tion about hawking. But there 
was also a fascination about the 
copper-strip sparker. And he 
went down the mountain to work 
on it. 

Thereafter he hawked less. 
After several years he was forced 
to give it up altogether. He had 
chosen his life, the dedicated 
career of an inventor, and he 
stayed with it for sixty-five years.

His sparker was not a success. 
It would be expensive, its spark 
was uncertain and it had almost 
no advantage over flint. People 
could always start a fire. If not, 
they could borrow a brand from 
a neighbor. There was no market 
for the sparker. But it was a nice 
machine, hammered copper strips 
wrapped around iron teased with 
lodestone, and the thing turned 
with a hand crank. He never 
gave it up entirely. He based 
other things upon it; and the 
retrogressor of his last years 
could not have been built with- 
out it. 

But the main thing was steam, 
iron, and tools. He made the fin- 
est lathes. He revolutionized 
smelting and mining. He brought 
new things to power, and started 
the smoke to rolling. He made 
mistakes, he ran into dead ends, 
ho wasted whole decades. But 
one man can only do so much. 

He married a shrew, Audrey, 
knowing that a man cannot 
achieve without a goad as well 
as a goal. But he was without 
issue or disciple, and this worried 
him. 

He built steamboat and steam- 
train. His was the first steam 
thresher. He cleared the forests 
with wood-burning giants, and 
designed towns. He destroyed 
southern slavery with a steam- 
Powered cotton picker, and power 
and wealth followed him. 


For better or worse he brought 
the country up a long road, so 
there was hardly a custom of his 
boyhood that still continued. 
Probably no one man had ever 
changed a country so much in 
his lifetime. 

He fathered a true machine- 
tool industry, and brought rubber 
from the tropics and plastic from 
the laboratory. He pumped petro- 
leum, and used natural gas for 
illumination and steam power. 
He was honored and enriched; 
and, looking back, he had no 
reason to regard his life as 
wasted. 

“Yet I’ve missed so much. I 
tar-heeled and wasted a lot of 
time. If only I could have avoided 
the blind alleys, I could have 
done many times as much. I 
brought machine-tooling to its 
apex. But I neglected the finest 
tool of all, the mind. I used it as 
it is, but I had no time to study 
it, much less modify it. Others 
after me will do it all. But I 
rather wanted to do it all myself. 
Now it is too late.” 

TTE went back and worked with 
his old sparker and its de- 
scendants, now that he was old. 
He built toys along the line of it 
that need not always have re- 
mained toys. He made a televox, 
but the only practical application 
was that now Audrey could rail 
at him over a greater distance. 


r AIN BIRD

He fired up a little steam dynamo 
in his house, ran wires and made 
it burn lights in his barn. 

And he built a retrogressor. 

“I would do much more along 
this line had I the time. But I’m 
pepper-bellied pretty near the 
end of the road. It is like finally 
coming to a gate and seeing a 
whole greater world beyond it, 
and being too old and too feeble 
to enter.” 

He kicked a chair and broke 
it. 

“I never even made a better 
chair. Never got around to it. 
There are so clod-hopping many 
things I meant to do. I have may- 
be pushed the country ahead a 
couple of decades faster than it 
would otherwise have gone. But 
what couldn’t I have done if it 
weren’t for the blind alleys! Ten 
years lost in one of them, twelve 
in one. If only there had been a 
way to tell the true from the 
false, and to leave to others what 
they could do, and to do myself 
only what nobody else could do. 
To see a link (however unlikely) 
and go out and get it and set it 
in its place. O the waste, the wil- 
derness that a talent can wander 
in! If I had only had a mentor! 
If I had had a map, a clue, a hat- 
ful of clues. I was born shrewd, 
and I shrewdly cut a path and 
went a grand ways. But always 
there was a clearer path and 
a faster way that I did not see 


till later. As my name is Rainbird, 
if I had it to do over, I’d do it 
infinitely better.” 

He began to write a list of the 
things that he’d have done better. 
Then he stopped and threw away 
his pen in disgust. 

“Never did even invent a de- 
cent ink-pen. Never got around 
to it. Dog-eared damnation, 
there’s so much I didn’t do!” 

He poured himself a jolt, but 
he made a face as he drank it. 

“Never got around to distilling 
a really better whisky. Had some 
good ideas along that line too. 
So many things I never did do. 
Well, I can’t improve things by 
talking to myself here about it.” 
Then he sat and thought. 
“But I burr-tailed can improve 
things by talking to myself there 
about it.” 

He turned on his retrogressor, 
and went back sixty-five years 
and up two thousand feet. 

IGGSTON Rainbird was 
hawking from the top of 
Devil’s Head Mountain one June 
afternoon in 1779. He flew his 
bird down through the white- 
fleece clouds, and to him it was 
sport indeed. Then it came back, 
climbing the shimmering air, and 
brought a pigeon to him. 

“It’s fun,” said the old man, 
“but the bird is tough, and you 
have a lot to do. Sit down and 
listen, Higgston.” 



136 


GALAXY 




“How do you know the bird 
is tough? Who are you, and how 
did an old man like you climb up 
here without my seeing you. And 
how in hellpepper did you know 
that my name was Higgston?” 

“I ate the bird and I remember 
that it was tough. I am just an 
old man who would tell you a 
few things to avoid in your life, 
and I came up here by means of 
an invention of my own. And I 
know your name is Higgston, as 
it is also my name; you being 
named after me, or I after you, 
I forget which. Which one of us 
is the oldest anyhow?” 

“I had thought that you were, 
old man. I am a little interested 
in inventions myself. How does 
the one that carried you Up here 
work?” 

“It begins, well it begins with 
something like your sparker, 
Higgston. And as the years go by 
you adapt and add. But it is 
all tinkering with a force field 
till you are able to warp it a 
little. Now then, you are an ewer- 
eared galoot and not as hand- 
some as I remembered you; but 
I happen to know that you have 
the makings of a fine man. Listen 
now as hard as evqr you listened 
in your life. I doubt that I will 
be able to repeat. I will save 
you years and decades; I will 
tell you the best road to take 
over a journey which it was once 
said that a man could travel but 


once. Man, I’ll pave a path for 
you over the hard places and 
strew palms before your feet.” 
“Talk, you addle-pated old 
gaff. No man ever listened so 
hard before.” 

T HE old man talked to the 
young one for five hours. Not 
a word was wasted: they were 
neither of them given to wasting 
words. He told him that steam 
wasn’t everything — this before 
he knew that it was anything. It 
was a giant power, but it was 
limited. Other powers, perhaps, 
were not. He instructed him to 
explore the possibilities of ampli- 
fication and feedback, and to use 
always the lightest medium of 
transmission of power: wire rath- 
er than mule-drawn coal cart, 
air rather than wire, ether rather 
than air. He warned against time 
wasted in shoring up the obsolete, 
and of the bottomless quicksand 
of cliche, both of word and of 
thought. 

He admonished him not to 
waste precious months in trying 
to devise the perfect apple-corer; 
there will never be a perfect 
apple-corer. He begged him not 
to build a better bob-sled. There 
would be things far swifter than 
the bob-sled. 

Let others make the new hide- 
scrapers and tanning salts. Let 
others aid the carter and the 
candle-molder and the cooper in 


RAINBIRD 


137 


their arts. There was need for a 
better halm, a better horse-block, 
a better stile, a better whetstone. 
Well, let others fill those needs. 
If our button-hooks, our fire-dogs, 
our whiffle-trees, our boot- jacks, 
our cheese-presses are all badly 
designed and a disgrace, then let 
someone else remove that dis- 
grace. Let others aid the cord- 
wainer and the cobbler. Let 
Higgston do only the high work 
that nobody else would be able 
to do. 

There would come a time 
when the farrier himself would 
disappear, as the fletcher had all 
but disappeared. But new trades 
would open for a man with an 
open mind. 

Then the old man got specific. 
He showed young Higgston a de- 
sign for a lathe-dog that would 
save time. He told him how to 
draw, rather than hammer wire; 
and advised him of the virtues 
of mica as insulator until better 
materials should come to hand. 

“And here there are some 
things that you will have to take 
on faith,” said the old man, 
“things of which we learn the 
‘what’ before we fathom the 
‘why.’ ” 

He explained to him the shut- 
tle armature and the self-exciting 
field and commutation; and the 
possibilities that alternation car- 
ried to its ultimate might open 
up. He told him a bejammed lot 


of things about a confounded huge 
variety of subjects. 

“And a little mathematics 
never hurt a practical man,” said 
the old gaffer. “I was self-taught, 
and it slowed me down.” 

They hunkered down there, 
and the old man cyphered it all 
out in the dust on the top of 
Devil’s Head Mountain. He 
showed him natural logarithms 
and rotating vectors and the cal- 
culi and such; but he didn’t push 
it too far, as even a smart boy 
can learn only so much in a few 
minutes. He then gave him a 
little advice on the treatment of 
Audrey, knowing it would be 
useless, for the art of living with 
a shrew is a thing that cannot 
be explained to another. 

“Now hood your hawk and go 
down the mountain and go to 
work,” the old man said. And 
that is what young Higgston 
Rainbird did. 

T HE career of the Yankee in- 
ventor, Higgston Rainbird, 
was meteoric. The wise men of 
Greece were little boys to him, 
the Renaissance giants had only 
knocked at the door but had not 
tried the knob. And it was un- 
locked all the time. 

The milestones that Higgston 
left are breathtaking. He built a 
short high dam on the flank of 
Devil’s Head Mountain, and had 
hydroelectric power for his own 


138 


GALAXY 


shop in that same year (1779). 
He had an arc light burning in 
Horse-Head Lighthouse in 1781. 
He read by true incandescent 
light in 1783, and lighted his 
native village, Knobknocker, 
three years later. He drove a 
charcoal-fueled automobile in 
1787, switched to a distillate of 
whale oil in 1789, and used true 
rock-oil in 1790. His gasoline 
powered combination reaper- 
thresher was in commercial pro- 
duction in 1793, the same year 
that he wired Centerville for 
light and power. His first diesel 
locomotive made its trial run in 
1796, in which year he also con- 
verted one of his earlier coal- 
burning steam ships to liquid 
fuel. 

In 1799 he had wired Phila- 
delphia for light and power, a 
major breakthrough, for the big 
cities had manfully resisted the 
innovations. On the night of the 
turn of the century he unhooded 
a whole clutch of new things, 
wireless telegraphy, the televox, 
radio transmission and reception, 
motile and audible theatrical re- 
productions, a machine to trans- 
mit the human voice into print, 
and a method of sterilizing and 
Wrapping meat to permit its in- 
definite preservation at any tem- 
perature. 

And in the spring of that new 
year he first flew a heavier-than- 
air vehicle. 


“He has made all the basic 
inventions,” said the many- 
tongued people. “Now there re- 
mains only their refinement and 
proper utilization.” 

“Horse hockey,” said Higgston 
Rainbird. He made a rocket that 
could carry freight to England 
in thirteen minutes at seven cents 
a hundredweight. This was in 
1805. He had fissionable power 
in 1813, and within four years 
had the price down where it 
could be used for desalting sea- 
water to the eventual irrigation 
of five million square miles of 
remarkably dry land. 

He built a Think Machine to 
work out the problems that he 
was too busy to solve, and a 
Prediction Machine to pose him 
new problems and new areas of 
breakthrough. 

In 1821, on his birthday, he 
hit the moon with a marker. He 
bet a crony that he would be 
able to go up personally one 
year later and retrieve it. And he 
won the bet. 

In 1830 he first put on the 
market his Red Ball Pipe To- 
bacco, an aromatic and expen- 
sive crimp cut made of Martian 
lichen. 

In 1836 he founded the Insti- 
tute for the Atmospheric Reha- 
bilitation of Venus, for he found 
that place to be worse than a 
smoke-house. It was there that 
he developed that hacking cough 


Rainbird 


139 


that stayed with him till the 
end of his days. 

He synthesized a man of his 
own age and disreputude who 
would sit drinking with him in 
the after-midnight hours and 
say, “You’re so right, Higgston, 
so incontestably right.” 

His plain for the Simplification 
and Eventual Elimination of 
Government was adopted (in 
modified form) in 1840, a fruit 
of his Political and Economic 
Balance Institute. 

Yet, for all his seemingly suc- 
cessful penetration of the field, 
he realized that man was the 
one truly cantankerous animal, 
and that Human Engineering 
would remain one of the never- 
completely-resolved fields. 

He made a partial break- 
through in telepathy, starting 
with the personal knowledge that 
shrews are always able .to read 
the minds of their spouses. He 
knew that the secret was not in 
sympathetic reception, but in ar- 
rogant break-in. With the polite 
it is forever impossible, but he 
disguised this discovery as polite- 
ly as he could. 

And he worked toward corpo- 
real immortality and the apotheo- 
sis of mankind, that cantankerous 
animal. 

He designed a fabric that 
would embulk itself on a temper- 
ature drop, and thin to an airy 
sheen in summery weather. The 


weather itself he disdained to 
modify, but he did evolve infalli- 
ble prediction of exact daily rain- 
fall and temperature for decades 
in advance. 

And he built a retrogressor. 

/"VNE day he looked in the mir- 
” ror and frowned. 

“I never did get around to 
making a better mirror. This one 
is hideous. However (to consider 
every possibility) let us weigh 
the thesis that it is the image 
and not the mirror that is hid- 
eous.” 

He called up an acquaintence. 

“Say, Ulois, what year is this 
anyhow?” 

“1844.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Reasonably sure.” 

“How old am I?” 

“Eighty-five, I think, Higgston.” 

“How long have I been an old 
man?” 

“Quite a while, Higgston, quite 
a while.” 

Higgston Rainbird hung up 
rudely. 

“I wonder how I ever let a 
thing like that slip up on me?" 
he said to himself. “I should have 
gone on corporeal immortality a 
little earlier. I’ve bungled the 
whole business now.” 

He fiddled with his Prediction 
Machine and saw that he was to 
die that very year. He did not 
seek a finer reading. 


“What a saddle-galled splay- 
footed situation to find myself 
in! I never got around to a tenth 
of the things I really wanted to 
do. O, I was smart enough; I 
just ran up too many blind alleys. 
Never found the answers to half 
the old riddles. Should have built 
the Prediction Machine at the 
beginning instead of the end. But 
I didn’t know how to build it at 
the beginning. There ought to be 
a way to get more done. Never 
got any advice in my life worth 
taking except from that nutty old 
man on the mountain when I 
was a young man. There’s a lot 
of things I’ve only started on. 
Well, every man doesn’t hang, 
but every man does come to the 
end of his rope. I never did get 
around to making that rope ex- 
tensible. And I can’t improve 
things by talking to myself here 
about it.” 

He filled his pipe with Red 
Ball crimpcut and thought a 
while. 

“But I hill-hopping can im- 
prove things talking to myself 
there about it.” 

Then he turned on his retro- 
gressor and went back and up. 

V7 - OUNG Higgston Rainbird 

was hawking from the top of 
Devil’s Head Mountain on a 
June afternoon in 1779. He flew 
his hawk down through the white 
clouds, and decided that he was 


the finest fellow in the world and 
master of the finest sport. If there 
was earth below the clouds it was 
far away and unimportant. 

The hunting bird came back, 
climbing the tall air, with a 
pigeon from the lower regions. 

“Forget the bird,” said the old 
man, “and give a listen with those 
outsized ears of yours. I have a 
lot to tell you in a very little 
while, and then you must devote 
yourself to a concentrated life of 
work. Hood the bird and clip 
him to the stake. Is that bridle- 
clip of your own invention? Ah 
yes, I remember now that it is.” 
“I’ll just fly him down once 
more, old man, and then I’ll have 
a look at what you’re selling.” 
“No, no. Hood him at once. 
This is your moment of decision. 
That is a boyishness that you 
must give up. Listen to me, Higg- 
ston, and I will orient your life 
for you.” 

“I rather intended to orient it 
myself. How did you get up here, 
old man, without me seeing you? 
How, in fact, did you get up here 
at all? It’s a hard climb.” 

“Yes, I remember that it is. I 
came up here on the wings of an 
invention of my own. Now pay 
attention for a few hours. It will 
take all your considerable wit.” 
“A few hours and a perfect 
hawking afternoon will be gone. 
This may be the finest day ever 
made.” 


RAINBIRD 


141 


“I also once felt that it was, 
but I manfully gave it up. So 
must you.” 

“Let me fly the hawk down 
again and I will listen to you 
while it is gone.” 

“But you will only be listen- 
ing with half a mind, and the 
rest will be with the hawk.” 

But young Higgston flew the 
bird down through the shining 
white clouds, and the old man 
began his rigmarole sadly. Yet 
it was a rang-dang-do of a spiel, 
a mummywhammy of admoni- 
tion and exposition, and young 
Higgston listened entranced and 
almost forgot his hawk. The old 
man told him that he must stride 
half a dozen roads at once, and 
yet never take a wrong one; that 
he must do some things earlier 
that on the alternative had been 
done quite late; that he must 
point his technique at the Think 
Machine and the Prediction Ma- 
chine, and at the unsolved prob- 
lem of corporeal immortality. 

“In no other way can you real- 
ly acquire elbow-room, ample 
working time. Time runs out and 
life is too short if you let it take 
its natural course. Are you listen- 
ing to me, Higgston?” 

But the hawk came back, 
climbing the steep air, and it 
had a gray dove. The old man 
sighed at the interruption, for 
he knew that his project was in 
peril. 


“Hood the hawk. It’s a sport 
for boys. Now listen to me, you 
spraddling jack. I am telling you 
things that nobody else would 
ever be able to tell you! I will 
show you how to fly falcons to 
the stars, not just down to the 
meadows and birch groves at the 
foot of this mountain.” 

“There is no prey up there,” 
said young Higgston. 

“There is. Gamier prey than 
you ever dreamed of. Hood the 
bird and snaffle him.” 

“I’ll just fly him down one 
more time and listen to you till 
he comes back.” 

The hawk went down through 
the clouds like a golden bolt of 
summer lightning. 

'T'HEN the old man, taking the 
cosmos, peeled it open layer 
by layer like an onion, and told 
young Higgston how it worked. 
Afterwards he returned ,to the 
technological beginning and he 
lined out the workings of steam 
and petro and electro-magnetism, 
and explained that these simple 
powers must be used for a short 
interval in the invention of greats 
er power. He told him of waves 
and resonance and airy transmis- 
sion, and fission and flight and 
over-flight. And that none of the 
doors required keys, only a reso- 
lute man to turn the knob and 
push them open. Young Higgston 
was impressed. 


142 


GALAXY 


Then the hawk came back, 
climbing the towering air, and 
it had a mainbird. 

The old man had lively eyes, 
but now they took on a new 
light. 

“Nobody ever gives up pleas- 
ure willingly,” he said, “and there 
is always the sneaking feeling 
that the bargain may not have 
been perfect. This is one of the 
things I have missed. I haven’t 
hawked for sixty-five years. Let 
me fly him this time, Higgston.” 
“You know how?” 

“I am an adept. And I once 
intended to make a better gaunt- 
let for hawkers. This hasn’t been 
improved since Nimrod’s time.” 
“I have an idea for a better 
gauntlet myself, old man.” 

“Yes. I know what your idea 
is. Go ahead with it. It’s practical.” 
“Fly him if you want to, old 
man.” 

And old Higgston flew the ter- 
cel hawk down through the 
gleaming clouds, and he and 
young- Higgston watched from 
the top of the world. And then 
young Higgston Rainbird was 
standing alone on the top of 
Devil’s Head Mountain, and the 
old man was gone. 

“I wonder where he went? 
And where in apple-knockers’ 
heaven did he come from? Or 
was he ever here at all? That’s 
a danged funny machine he came 
in, if he did come in it. All the 


wheels are on the inside. But I 
can use the gears from it, and 
the clock, and the copper wire. 
It must have taken weeks to 
hammer that much wire out that 
fine. I wish I’d paid more atten- 
tion to what he was saying, but 
he poured it on a little thick. I’d 
have gone along with him on it 
if only he’d have found a good 
stopping place a little sooner, and 
hadn’t been so insistent on giving 
up hawking. Well, I’ll just hawk 
here till dark, and if it dawns 
clear I’ll be up again in the 
morning. And Sunday, if I have 
a little time, I may work on 
my sparker or my chestnut 
roaster.” ■ 

YTIGGSTON Rainbird lived a 
long and successful life. Lo- 
cally he was known best as a 
hawker and horse racer. But as 
an inventor he was recognized 
as far as Boston. 

He is still known, in a limited 
way, to specialists in the field 
and the period: known as con- 
tributor to the development of 
the moldboard plow, as the de- 
signer of the Nonpareil Nutmeg 
Grater with the safety feature, 
for a bellows, for a sparker for 
starting fires (little used) and 
for the Devil’s Claw Wedge for 
splitting logs. 

He is known for such, and for 
no more.

THE SIRENS OF TITAN by 
Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

VONNEGUT’S BITTER satire 
is reminiscent in many respects 
of Bernard Wolfe’s Limbo. Both 
are crammed full of new ideas yet 
weary with old. Both have sparks 
of humor that turn to ash. 

A weird triangle is the hub of 
the story. The husband, a brave, 
wise, charming aristocrat, was de- 
materialized on an exploration 
into a space hazard between 
planets. He becomes a sort of 
ghost who materializes for an 


hour once every fifty-five days. A 
side result of his tragedy is an 
ability to see both past and 
future. As a most peculiar step 
toward establishing peace and 
brotherhood, he engineers the 
impregnation of his wife, an im- 
maculate patrician, by a piggish 
wastrel. 

The plot, is tangled, intricate 
and tortuous and the author man- 
ufactures mystery and suspense 
by the deliberate use of time 
jump and flashback. 

Yet the book, though exasper- 
ating, is a joy of inventiveness.

WALL OF SERPENTS by L. 
Sprague de Camp and Fletcher 
Pratt. Thomas Bouregy & Co. 

DECAMP AND PRATT were 
far and away the finest team of 
fantasy collaborators. In their 
present misadventure, Shea and 
his Faerie wife, Belphebe, become 
involved in the land of the Fin-

If de Camp’s and Pratt’s heroes

REACHING FOR THE STARS 
by Erik Bergaust. Doubleday &

WERNHER VON Braun is an 
extremely controversial figure. 
Despite his stature in our space 
program, many Americans have 
never become reconciled to the 
presence of a former enemy and 
self-admitted Nazi in a most sen-

has obviously been forgiven by 
the top brass and today his enor-

Because of von Braun’s single-

than just his biography. It is also 
the history of modem rocketry.

THINKING MACHINES by Irv- 
ing Adler. The John Day Co. 

TO THE man in the street, the 
word “Computer” conjures up a 
vision of a vast electronic monster 
busily tended by a horde of hu- 
man ministrators. This was 
largely true until the recent past 
but miniaturization and simplifi- 
cation have reaped such rewards 
that room-sized and even desk- 
sized computers are now extant. 
The layman, however, still would 
like two questions answered: 
What does it do and How does it 
do it? 

Adler’s book answers these 
questions in comparatively simple 
form — for someone with a good 
high school math background. 


THE PROJECT by Andrew

THE “PROJECT” is the program

delves into the character of the 
weapon’s prime architects and 
their movements and actions on 
the night preceding the final test. 
It is a bitter indictment of the 
idiocy that places the means for 
utter destruction in the hands of 
a few and makes it possible for a 
highly placed psychotic to be- 
come mankind’s executioner.

Illustrated by FINLAY 


T HE Reverend Clem Adel- 
burg had come out to cut 
some mistletoe. He tucked 
the hatchet tightly in the band of 
his trousers and shinned up the 
knobby trunk of the apple tree. 
When he got high enough, he 
saw that two ravens were seated 
on the apple tree branches, eating 
the mistletoe berries. There were 
always ravens around the cabin 
nowadays; he chased them away 
indignantly, with many loud 
whooshes. Then he felt a twinge 
of remorse. 

“O Lord,” he prayed among 
the branches, his face upturned 
toward the dramatic cloudscape 
of an Arizona winter, “O Lord, 
bless this little experiment of thy 

148 


servant. O Lord, grant that I 
wasn’t wrong to chase away those 
darned ravens. Yes, Lord.” 

He sighted up at the branches. 
He chopped with the hatchet. 
Three branches of mistletoe fell 
down on the sheets of newspaper 
he had previously placed at the 
foot of the tree. He climbed down. 

It was beginning to get dark. 
Mazda would have supper ready. 
There was a premonitory rumble 
and then the sound of Silent 
Night, played on an electric xylo- 
phone, filled the sky. 

The Reverend Adelburg frown- 
ed. The noise must be coming 
from Parker; the municipal 
Christmas tree there would be 
thirty-five feet tall this year, and 

GALAXY 


already he could see the red glow 
of Parker’s municipal Christmas 
street-decoration project in the 
southern sky. Well. If the Lord 
continued to bless him, and if his 
next few sermons had the effect 
he hoped they’d have, he might 
be able to change the character 
of Parker’s Christmas celebration. 
The Forthright Temple, in Los 
Angeles, was a long way from 
Parker, but his broadcasts were 
receivable here, too. 

He went in the kitchen. Mazda 
was cooking something on the oil 
stove, an oil lamp burning dimly 
on the table beside her. The 
kitchen smelled good. 

“Hello, Clem,” she said, turn- 
ing to face him. She smiled at 
him. “Did you get the berries for 
the tea?” 

“Yes, dear.” He handed her the 
three branches of mistletoe. 

“Make it good and strong this 

time, dear. I just want to see if 
there’s anything in my little idea.” 

“About mistletoe being the 

common element in all religions? 
Sure.” 

TTE watched her as she went to 
fill the teakettle at the sink. 
She was a tall woman, with 
masses of puffy ginger hair and a 
very fair skin. Her figure was 

excellent, though rangy, and he 
always enjoyed watching her. 

Most of the time Mazda’s being 
in the cabin seemed so ordinary, 

AN OLD FASHIONED Bl 


so fitting (she was remarkably 
domestic, when you got to know 
her), that he simply didn’t think 
about it. But there were moments, 
like the present, when her 
physical immediacy seemed to 
catch him in the solar plexus. 
Then he could only stand and 
look at her and draw deep, sur- 
prised breaths. 

It wasn’t so much his living 
with her, in the technical sense, 
that troubled him. He hadn’t 
even tried to feel guilty about 
that. It seemed at once so ex- 
traordinary and so perfectly 
natural, that it wasn’t something 
his conscience could get a grip 
on. No, it was Mazda’s being 
in the cabin at all that was the 
surprising thing. 

Where had she come from, 
anyhow? He’d gone outside one 
morning early in September, 
meaning to walk up and down 
in the sand while he put the 
finishing touches on his sermon 
for next week, and there she had 
been, sitting quietly under a 
Joshua tree. 

She couldn’t have been there 
for more than ten minutes. Her 
skin, as he had come to know 
later, was extraordinarily sensi- 
tive to sunlight, and she was wear- 
ing the skimpiest Bikini imagin- 
able. She’d have been sunburned 
all over if she’d been there for 
any length of time. And how had 
she got there? There’d been no 

RD CHRISTMAS 149 




sign of a car in any direction, and 
he hadn’t even heard the noise of 
a plane or a copter in the sky. 
Had she walked over from Par- 
ker? In a Bikini? Five miles? 

He knew so little about her — 
no more now, really, than he had 
known on that first day when she 
had said, “Hi,” and gone in the 
house. It wasn’t that she was 
close-mouthed or sullen. She just 
didn’t talk about herself. Once 
only, when he had been elaborat- 
ing his idea that the use of mistle- 
toe might be the common element 
behind all religion, had she come 
out with anything that might be 
a personal remark. He’d spoken 
of the use of mistletoe in classical 
paganism, in' druidism, in Chris- 
tian festival, in the old Norse reli- 
gion, in Zoroastrism — 

Her lower lip had begun to 
protrude defiantly. “There’s no 
mistletoe in Zoroastrism,” she had 
cut in sharply. “I know.” 

Well? It wasn’t much for the 
fruit of more than three months. 

He couldn’t help wondering 
about Mazda sometimes, though 
he didn’t want to fail in Christian 
charity. But he knew he had his 
enemies. Could she possibly be a 
Retail Merchants Association 
spy? 

t| ''HE teakettle was beginning to 
hum. Mazda gave the pot of 
string beans on the stove a stir 
with a wooden spoon. “How did 


you come out with your sermon, 
Clem?” she asked. 

“Eh? Oh, splendidly. The end- 
ing, I really think, will have an 
effect. There are some striking 
passages. The ravens were quite 
impressed.” He smiled at his little 
joke. 

“Ravens?” She turned to face 
him. “Were there ravens outside 
when you were rehearsing your 
speech?” 

“Yes, indeed. We have ravens 
all the time here now. There were 
even ravens in the apple tree 
when I was cutting the mistletoe.” 

Her eyes widened. “Oh . .” 
she said thoughtfully. 

“I fear I chased them away a 
little too vehemently,” he said, 
becoming serious. “Ravens, after 
all, are the Lord’s creatures too.” 

“Not those ravens,” Mazda said. 

There was a very brief pause. 
Mazda fingered the wooden 
bracelet on her left wrist. Then 
she said, “Listen, Clem, I know 
you’ve talked about it, but I 
guess I’m just dumb. Why are 
you so down on modern Christ- 
mases, anyway?” 

“My dear, if you’d ever attend 
the Temple services — ” the Rev- 
erend Adelburg said in gentle re- 
proof. “But I’ll try to make my 
point of view, which I humbly 
trust is also the Lord’s point of 
view, clear to you.” He began to 
talk. 

He was an excellent talker.

on the cheek and then — she had 
seductive shoulders, despite her 
ranginess — on the upper arm. 

“Mmmmmmmm,” Mazda said. 

When he had gone into the 
pantry to wash, she looked after 
him slantingly. Her caramel- 
colored eyebrows drew together 
in a frown. She had already 
scalded out the teapot. Now she 
reached into the drawer of the 
kitchen table and drew out a 
handful of what looked like small 
mushrooms. They were, as a 
matter of fact, mescal buttons, 
and she had gathered them last 
week from the top of a plant of 
Lophophora Williamsii herself.

CHE cut them up neatly with a 
^ paring knife and dropped 
them into the teapot. She put 
the mistletoe berries in on top of 
the mescal buttons. Then she 
filled the teapot with boiling 
water. When the Reverend got 
back from his washing, the teapot 
was steaming domestically on the 
table beside the string beans. 

He said grace and poured him- 
self a cup of the tea. “Goodness, 
but it’s bitter,” he observed, sip- 
ping. “Not at all like it was the 
first time. What a difference put- 
ting in more mistletoe has made!” 

Mazda looked down. She 
passed him the sugar bowl. He 
sweetened the tea lavishly. “You

finished. Mazda nodded for 
the last time;. “Um-hum,” she 
said. “But you know what I think, 
Clem? I think you just don’t like 
lights. When it’s dark, you want 
it to be dark. It’s reasonable 
enough — you’re a different guy 
once the sun goes down.” 

“I don’t like the false lights of 
modernity,” the Reverend said 
with a touch of stiffness. “As I 
intend to make abundantly clear 
in my sermon tomorrow.” 

“Um-hum. You’re a wonderful 
talker. I never thought I’d get 
fond of somebody who didn’t 
like light.” 

“I like some kinds of light,” 
said the Reverend Adelburg. “I 
like fires.” 

Mazda drew a deep breath. 
“You’d better wash up before 
supper, Clem,” she said. “You’ve 
got rosin on you from the apple 
tree.” 

“All right, dear.” He kissed her

haven’t set a cup for yourself, 
dear,” he said, suddenly solicitous. 

“There isn’t much tea. You 
said to make it strong.” 

“Yes, honey, but if there’s any 
good in the tea, I want you to 
share it. Get another cup.” 

He looked across the table at 
her, brightly and affectionately. 
There was a faint flush in Mazda’s 
cheeks as she obeyed. 

Supper was over and Mazda 
was washing the dishes when the 
Reverend Clem said suddenly, 
“How fast you’re moving, Mazda! 
I never saw anything like the 
way you’re getting through those 
dishes. I can hardly see your 
hands, they’re moving so fast.” 
“Fast?” Mazda echoed. She 
sounded bewildered. She held up 
a spoon and polished its bowl 
languidly in the light of the oil 
lamp. “Why, I’m not moving fast. 
I’ve been standing here by the 
sink for hours and hours, wash- 
ing one dish. I don’t know what’s 
the matter with me. I wish I 
could move fast.” 

There was a silence. Mazda 
had finished the dishes. She took 
off her apron and sat down on 
the floor, her feet out straight in 
front of her. Almost immediately 
the Reverend Adelburg slid off 
the chair where he had been sit- 
ting, and flopped down on the 
floor parallel to her. Both their 
legs were stretched out. 

“What lovely hands you have, 


Mazda,” he said. He picked up 
one of them from her lap, where 
it was languidly lying, and turned 
it about admiringly. “Your fingers 
remind me of the verse in the 
Canticles — ‘Fair are my love’s 
palms as an eel that feedeth 
among lilies. And the coals thereof 
hath a most vehement flame.’ 
They’re even colored like eels, 
purple and gold and silver. Your 
nails are little dark rainbows. The 
Lord bless you, Mazda. I love 
you very much.” 

He put his arm around her. 
She let her head decline on his 
shoulder, and they both leaned 
back against the wall. “Are you 
happy, dear?” he asked her an- 
xiously. “As happy as I am? Do 
you have a dim sweet bird sense 
of blessings hovering over you?” 
“Um-hum,” Mazda answered. 
It was obviously difficult for her 
to talk. “Never felt better.” A 
grin zig-zagged across her face. 
“Mu's’ be the mistletoe.” 

r T'HE effects of peyote — mescal 
button — intoxication are pre- 
dictable. They run a definite 
course. None the less, the re- 
sponse to a drug is always some- 
what idiosyncratic. Thus it was 
that the Reverend Clem Adel- 
burg, who had drunk enough 
peyote infusion to keep a cart 
horse seeing beatific visions for 
twenty-four hours, reached, about 
six o’clock in the morning, the 


152 


GALAXY 


state of intense wakefulness that 
succeeds to the drug trance. By 
the time the copter came from 
Los Angeles to take him to the 
Temple, a little after eight, he 
had bathed, shaved and dressed, 
and was reading over his sermon 
notes. 

He went into the bedroom 
where Mazda was lying to bid 
her good-by. (Sometime during 
the night they had managed to 
get to bed.) He bent over and 
kissed her tenderly on her loos- 
ened mouth. “Good-by, dear. Our 
little experiment certainly had 
results, didn’t it? But I feel no 
ill after-effect, and I trust that 
you will not, either. I’ll be back 
about eleven tonight.” 

Once more he kissed her. 
Mazda made a desperate effort 
to rouse herself from the rose 
and opal-hued heaven she was 
currently floating in. She licked 
her lips. “Clem . .” she said. 

“Yes, dear?” 

“Be careful.” 

“Certainly, dear. I always am. 
Yes.” 

He patted her on the shoulder. 
He went out. Even in her para- 
dise, which was at the moment 
blue and silver, she could hear 
the noise of the copter as it bore 
him away. 

Mazda’s drug dreams came to 
an end with a bump about twelve 
o’clock. She sprang out of bed 
and ran to the window. The 


Reverend Adelburg was gone, of 
course. And there wasn’t a raven 
in sight. 

/"\VER in Los Angeles, the Rev- 
erend’s sermon was going 
swimmingly. From his first words, 
which had been the arresting 
sentence, “The lights are going 
out again all over the world,” he 
had riveted the attention of his 
listeners as if with stainless steel 
rivets. Even the two troops of 
Archer Eagle Scouts in the front 
rows, who, with their scoutmaster 
Joe Buell, were today’s Honor 
Guests, had been so fascinated 
that they had stopped twanging 
their bowstrings. The Reverend 
had swung thunderously from 
climax to climax; by now at least 
half his audience had resolved to 
disconnect its radio when it got 
home, and throw away the electric 
lights on its Christmas tree. Now 
the Reverend was approaching 
the climax of climaxes. 

“In the sweet night of the spirit, 
bless us, O Lord! Yes, Lord, it’s 
good to be dark — in the sweet 
silence of the stable let the little 
flame of — bless us, Lord! — let the 
little flame — My Gosh! Good 
Lord!” 

Forthright Temple is venti- 
lated, and partly lighted, by a 
clerestory in the middle part of 
the building. Through this clere- 
story eight large black birds flew 
rapidly. 


AN OLD FASHIONED BIRD CHRISTMAS 


153 


Two of them headed straight 
for the Reverend Adelburg’s 
eyes. Four of them attacked the 
Temple’s not very bright electric 
lights. The other two made dive 
after dive on the helpless con- 
gregation’s head. 

Women were screaming. Hand- 
kerchiefs waved. Hymnbooks 
rocked and fluttered through the 
air. The organist burst into a 
Bach chorale. The bewildered 
choir began singing two different 
songs. 

When the ravens had first 
swooped down upon him, the 
Reverend Adelburg had dived 
under the lectern. From thence — 
he was a man who was used to 
authority — he began shouting 
orders to the troops of Archer 
Eagle Scouts in a clarion, sten- 
torian voice. 

“Young men! Listen! Shoot at 
the birds! Shoot — at — the — 
birds!” 

There was a very slight hiatus. 
Then bowstrings began to twang 
and arrows to thud. 

Eight pagan ravens are no 
match at all for the legitimate 
weapons of two troops of Archer 
Eagle Scouts. The ravens dived 
valiantly, they cawed and shriek- 
ed. In vain. Inside five minutes 
after the shooting started, there 
remained no trace of the birds’ 
incursus except a black tail 
feather floating in an updraft, 
eight or ten hymnbooks with 


ruffled pages and some arrows on 
the floor. 

For a few moments the scouts 
scurried about collecting arrows. 
Then the Reverend Adelburg 
summoned them up to the lec- 
tern, where he was standing. He 
finished his sermon with a troop 
of Archer Scouts drawn up on 
either side of him, like a body 
guard. 

“That was a wonderful sermon, 
wasn’t it,” said the lady from Iowa 
as she and her husband walked 
toward their parked car. “I never 
heard anything like it before. He 
really spoke better after the birds 
came in than he did earlier . 
I think tomorrow I’ll go down 
town and see if I can get some 
little oil lamps to burn in the 
patio.” 

“Wonder what sort of birds 
those were,” her husband said 
idly. “They were mighty big for 
crows.” 

“Crows! Why, they were 
ravens; haven’t you ever seen pic- 
tures of ravens? I wonder what 
made them go in the Temple. 
Ravens always seem such old- 
fashioned birds.” 

Ill

you,” Mazda said. She hic- 
coughed with emotion. “I’m a rat. 
As far as that goes, you’re a rat 
too. We’re both rats.”

GALAXY 


“What company is that?” the 
Reverend asked with innocent 
curiosity. He yawned. They had 
been sitting in the tiny living 
room, arguing, for hours, ever 
since he got back from the 
Temple, and by now it was nearly 
two o’clock in the morning. 

“The PE&G. Why? Did you 
ever suspect?” 

“I thought perhaps the Retail 
Merchants Association sent you. 
I never understood how you hap- 
pened to be sitting under that 
Joshua tree.” 

Mazda laughed scornfully. 
“The Retail Merchants? Those 
boffs? Why, I don’t suppose they 
have more than three secret 
agents in the whole Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. They couldn’t 
stop a baby from crossing a street 
on a kiddy car. Their idea of hot 
tactics is to hire a big newspaper 
ad. 

“No, I’m a PE&G girl. I’ve been 
one of their top people for years. 
That’s why I know what you’re 
up against.” 

She took an earnest step to- 
ward him. “Clem, I don’t think 
you have any idea of how serious 
this is,” she said. “But they’ll stop 
at nothing. They can’t possibly 
let you get away with it. Why, 
last December after your old- 
fashioned Christmas sermons, 
power consumption was off 27% 
all along the whole Pacific slope, 
and it didn’t get back to normal 


until late February. People just 
didn’t use much electricity. The 
Company didn’t pay any divi- 
dends at all on its common stock, 
and if the same thing happens 
this year, they’ll have to skip -pay- 
ments on the preferred! That’s 
why I was sent to stop you at 
all costs.” 

“How were you supposed to 
stop me?” the Reverend inquired. 
He put the tips of his outstretched 
fingers together thoughtfully. 

“I was supposed to seduce you, 
and then call the broadcasters in. 
You know, moral turpitude. But 
I convinced them that it wouldn’t 
work. Congregations aren’t so 
touchy about things like that 
nowadays. It wouldn’t have 
worked.” 

“Mazda, how could you?” 

66T don’t know how I could,” 
Mazda replied with spirit. 
“I could have had a nice clean- 
cut electronics engineer ... or 
one of those cute linemen up on 
a pole . and then I had to fall 
for a Reverend with his collar on 
backwards. Somebody ought to 
examine my head.” 

The Reverend Adelburg let 
this pass without comment. “What 
was the alternate plan?” he 
asked. 

“I promised them I’d keep you 
from delivering any more old- 
fashioned Christmas sermons. 
That’s what the peyote was for.”

“Peyote? When?” 

She told him. 

“Oh. Then it wasn’t the mistle- 
toe,” he said when she had finish- 
ed. He sounded rather annoyed. 

“No, it wasn’t the mistletoe. 
But I guess I didn’t give you 
enough peyote. You delivered 
the sermon anyway. 

“Clem, you think that because 
the ravens made that silly attack 
on you in the Temple, that that’s 
the sort of thing the Company 
has up its sleeve. It’s not. The 
ravens were acting on their own 
responsibility, and they’re not 
awfully bright birds. The Com- 
pany can do lots better than that 
when they want to.” 

“What do you think they’ll try 
next?” the Reverend inquired. His 
jaw had begun to jut out. 

“Well, they might try to get 
you for moral turpitude after all, 
or stick an income tax evasion 
charge on you or accuse you of 
dope smuggling. I don’t think 
they will. They don’t want to 
give you any more publicity. I 
think they’ll just quietly try to 
wipe you out.” 

For a moment Mazda’s self 
command deserted her. She 
wrung her hands. “What’m I to 
cfo?” she whimpered. “I’ve got to 
save you, and you’re as stubborn 
as a mule. I don’t know any 
magic — or at least not nearly 
enough magic. The whole Com- 
pany will be against me as soon 


as the ravens are sure I ratted 
on them. And there’s just no 
place in the world today for any- 
body who’s in conflict with the 
PE&G. 

“I wish I hadn’t been such a 
dope as to fall in love with you.” 

r T'HE Reverend Clem Adelburg 
got up from the chair where 
he had been sitting and put his 
arm around her. “Cheer up, my 
dear,” he told her solemnly. “We 
will defeat the company. Right 
is on our side.” 

Mazda gave a heroic sniffle. 
She smiled at him mistily. “It’s 
not just the PE&G, of course,” 
she said. “Sometimes I think they 
have agents everywhere.” 

“Not the PE&G?” the Reverend 
cried. He let his arm fall from 
around her. He had a sudden 
nightmare vision of a whole 
world united against him — a 
world in which the clouds sema- 
phored secrets about him to the 
dolphins in the Pacific waves. 
“What is it, then?” 

“Why, it’s Nous.” 

“I never heard of it.” 

“Very few people have. But 
Nous, Infinite, is the company 
from which the PE&G gets its 
power. 

“Nous is a very strange outfit. 
It operates on the far side of 3,000 
A.D., and selling power is only 
one of the things it does. When 
you’re a top agent for the Corn- 


156 


GALAXY 


pany, like I was, you hear all 
sorts of stories about it — for in- 
stance, that it’s responsible for 
maintaining the difference in po- 
tential between the earth and the 
ionosphere, or that the weather 
on Venus is a minor Nous pro- 
ject — stuff like that. I’ve even 
heard agents say that Nous is G 
— but I don’t believe that. I know 
about Mithras, myself.” 

“I thought the PE&G made its 
own power,” said the Reverend. 
He was still struggling with the 
first part of Mazda’s remarks. 

Mazda laughed. “I don’t mean 
any disrespect to the Company, 
but what makes you think that? 
The Company’s a bad opponent, 
but outside of that, witchcraft, 
or sorcery, or ravens, is all they’re 
capable of. 

“All the really hot develop- 
ments in power, the electronic 
stuff, comes from after 3,000 A.D. 
Nobody in the present has brains 
enough to work out a germanium 
transistor, for example. Nous 
helps them. People nowadays are 
dopes. They can’t work buttons 
on pants, or open a package of 
chewing gum unless there’s a 
paper ribbon to help them. 

“That’s beside the point, really. 
The thing I’m trying to make 
clear, Clem, is that Nous is a bad 
outfit to come up against. 

“I was supposed to go outside 
at one-thirty this morning and 
have the ravens pick me up under 


the Joshua tree. They were going 
to take me back to headquarters 
by air raft. If it — ” 

64TS that how you got here in 
-*■ the first place?” the Rever- 
end inquired. “By air raft?” 

“Yes. As I was saying, if I’d 
done that, the Company would 
have accepted that my failure 
with the peyote was just a mis- 
take. But I didn’t do it. I couldn’t 
bear to leave a chump like you 
all alone to face the Company, 
and by now they must be begin- 
ning to realize that I’ve ratted 
on them. It won’t be very long 
before the real trouble begins. 

“Now, listen. There are two 
things you can do. The best one 
would be for you to go outside 
and talk to the ravens. If you 
promise them on your word of 
honor as a Christian gentlemen 
that you won’t deliver any more 
anti-light sermons — I can’t see 
why you don’t like light, anyhow; 
light’s wonderful — if you promise 
them that, they’ll let you go.” She 
paused hopefully. 

The Reverend gave her a look. 
“Well,” said Mazda. “Then 
we’ll have to make a break for 
it. 

“While you were in the wash- 
room, I called the Temple copter.” 
She indicated the short-wave 
radio on the other side of the 
little stone fireplace. “It’ll be here 
any minute. I think — well, we’ll 


AN OLD FASHIONED BIRD CHRISTMAS 


157 


try to get through,” she said with- 
out much hope. 

The Reverend looked at her in 
silence for a moment. Fatigue had 
made shadows under her eyes, 
but they only made her look 
glamorous and desirable. She had 
never been more beautiful. She 
had betrayed her company for 
him; he loved her more than ever. 
He gave her a hug. 

“Nix, my dear,” he said. “Nix.” 
“N-n-n-n-?” 

“Nix. Never.” His voice rang 
out, booming and resonant. “Run 
away from those devils and their 
ravens? Flee from those pagan 
night-lighters? Never! I will not.” 
He advanced toward the radio. 

“What are you going to do?” 
Mazda squeaked. 

“I’m going to contact the TVA,” 
he said without turning. “You 
have to fight fire with fire.” 
“Public power?” Mazda breath- 
ed. Her face was white. 

“Public power! Their line will 
be open all night.” 

He turned his face toward the 
rafters. “O Lord,” he boomed 
reverently, “bless this radio mes- 
sage. Please, Lord, grant that in 
contacting a radical outfit like the 
TVA I’m doing aright.” 

IV 

hthe noise of prayer died away 
in the ceiling. He pressed a 
key and turned a switch. For a 


moment the room was utterly 
quiet. Then there was a soft flurry 
and plop at the window. 

The ravens, after all, were not 
deaf. They too had heard the 
Reverend’s prayers. 

Mazda spun round toward the 
sound. Before she could decide 
what to do, there was a series of 
tinkles from the chimney. It 
ended in a glassy crash. Some- 
thing had broken on the stone 
hearth. 

Mazda screamed. 

“Keep back!” she yelled at the 
Reverend, who had turned from 
the radio and was leaning for- 
ward interestedly. “Keep back! 
Don’t breathe! Damn those birds!” 
She was fumbling wildly with 
the wooden bracelet on her left 
wrist. 

‘What is it?” he asked. He 
advanced a step toward the shards 
of glass on the hearth. 

“Get back. It’s a germ culture 
bomb. Parrot fever. I’m going to 
purify it. Stand back!” 

The Reverend Adelburg dis- 
counted most of this warning as 
due to feminine hysteria. He 
drew back a fraction of an inch, 
but still remained leaning for- 
ward. his eyes fixed on the glass. 

Mazda gave a moan of despera- 
tion. “I’ve got to do it!” she yelled. 
She slid her bracelet toward her 
elbow and gave it a violent twist. 

A strictly vertical flash of light- 
ning appeared between the ceiling 


158 


GALAXY 


and the hearth. It was very 
, bright, and accompanied by a 
sizzling noise. A second later a 
sharp chlorine-like smell filled 
the air. 

Mazda’s artificial lightning died 
away. The room returned to its 
' normal dim illumination. A faint 
[ curl of smoke floated above the 
pieces of broken glass on the 
hearth of the fireplace. There was 
no doubt that Mazda had puri- 
fied the germ culture effectively. 
But the Reverend Clem Adel- 
burg was stretched out on the 
floor flat on his back. 

1%/fAZDA ran to him. She tore 
open his white shirt front and 
laid her head on his chest. His 
heart was still beating, and his 
hands and feet were warm. But 
he was completely out — outer 
than any of the neon lights he 
had been trying to put out. 

Mazda got up, rubbing her 
hands. She couldn’t move him, 
and she didn’t know what she 
ought to do for him. She hoped 
he’d be all right. She knew he 
had a strong constitution. She 
went into the kitchen and got a 
towel. 

She came back with it and 
tied it to the poker. Carrying 
this home-made flag of truce in 
front of her, she opened the door 
and went out into the night. 

It was a dark night. From under 
the Joshua tree a darker shadow 


detached itself. “ ’Llo, Mazda,” a 
harsh voice said. 

“Hello,” she replied. There was 
a glitter of beady eyes in the 
darkness around her. “Listen here, 
you birds,” Mazda said slowly, 
“we’ve always been on good 
terms, haven’t we? We’ve always 
got on together well. Are you 
really trying to do me and my 
boy friend in?” 

A bird cleared its throat. There 
was a noise of talons being shifted 
uneasily. “Well ... no, Mazda. 
We like you too,” somebody said. 

“Oh, yes? Is that why you 
dropped the parrot-fever bomb? 
Were you going to drop a dead 
parrot down the chimney and 
make it look as if we’d died a 
natural death? I wouldn’t call 
that bomb exactly a friendly 
thing.” 

“The bomb was just a warn- 
ing,” said the harsh voice that had 
spoken first. “We knew you’d 
purify it. We have confidence in 
you. We don’t want to do you 
any harm personally. You can 
always get another boy friend.” 

“I want this one.” 

“You’ve had better ones.” 

“Yes, I know. But this is the 
one I want.” 

There was a silence. Then a 
bird said, “We’re sorry, Mazda. 
We only do what we’re sent out 
to do.” 

Mazda drew a sharp breath. 
“Hell’s Canyon,” she said deliber- 


AN OLD FASHIONED BIRD CHRISTMAS

ately. “Rural electrification coop- 
eratives. Public power." 

T HERE was a sound as of some- 
body’s tail feathers being 
plucked distractedly. “Mazda, I 
wish you wouldn’t,” said the 
chief raven in a wincing voice. 

“I will, though. I’ll get in touch 
with the public power people. I 
don’t care about the ethics of it. 
I’m in love.” 

“Haw!” the raven jeered 
harshly. It seemed to have re- 
gained its aplomb. “That light- 
ning flash of yours burned out 
every tube in the radio. You 
couldn’t send a message to Parker 
to ask for a stick of chewing gum. 
You’re through. 

“We’ll give you half an hour. 
During any of that time you can 
come out unhurt. But after that 
you’re in for it too. This time 
we’re serious.” 

‘What are you going to do?” 
Mazda cried. 

“You’ll find out.” 

Mazda went back to the house. 
The clock on the mantlepiece 
read twenty minutes to three. 
The ravens would probably give 
her a few minutes’ grace, so she 
had until ten or twelve minutes 
after the hour. Mazda knelt down 
by her consort and began to chafe 
his hands. When that didn’t help, 
she ran to the kitchen, got a 
handful of red feathers from the 
chicken they had had for lunch 


yesterday, and began burning 
them under the Reverend’s nose. 

At seven minutes to three the 
Reverend’s eyelids fluttered and 
the noise of a copter was heard 
in the sky. Mazda listened with 
strained attention, her eyes fixed 
on her consort. She longed to 
run to the window, but she was 
afraid of alerting the ravens. She 
could only wait. 

The copter appeared to be 
having difficulties. The whoosh of 
its helix changed pitch, the motor 
stuttered and coughed. Once the 
noise seemed to recede; Mazda 
was afraid the plane was going 
away entirely. She fingered her 
wooden blast bracelet nervously. 
But the copter returned. It landed 
with a thump that was almost a 
crash. 

The copter door opened and 
somebody jumped out. There was 
a sound of squawks, caws and 
rapid fluttering. A vigorous male 
voice said, “Ouch! Ouch! Birds! 
What the bloody hell!” More 
fluttering. Then sandaled feet 
thudded rapidly along the path. 
Somebody pounded at the door. 

M AZDA ran to open it. The 
man who stumbled across 
the threshold was a dark, stocky 
Indian who wore white duck 
pants and red glasses, and carried 
a three-foot bow slung across his 
back. He was bleeding freely from 
half a dozen peck marks on his 


160

shoulders and breast. “Lord 
Mithras,” Mazda said prayerfully, 
“it’s Joe Buell! Joe!” 

“Mazda! Why didn’t you show 
a light? What are you doing here? 
What is all this?” 

Mazda told him. Joe listened 
intently, frowning more and 
more. “My word, what a mess,” 
he said when she had finished. He 
pushed his red glasses up on his 
nose. “Has the Reverend come to 
yet?” 

They turned around. Clem’s 
eyes were open, but he was still 
lying on the floor. As they 
watched, he slowly closed his eyes 
again. “I guess he’s not ready yet,” 
Mazda said. 

She looked at the clock. It 
showed two minutes to three. 
“Let’s get him up and walk him,” 
she said harriedly. “It might 
help him to get back to normal. 
Oh, Mithras, how late it is!” 

The Reverend Adelburg was 
limp and slippery, but they man- 
aged to get him to his feet. As 
they guided his rubbery footsteps 
about the room, Mazda said, “I 
haven’t seen you since you were 
in Canada, Joe. Those nights in 
Saskatchewan! I didn’t know you 
were one of the Reverend’s men.” 
“Since 1965,” Joe answered 
briefly. 

“How come? I thought you 
danced Shalako at the pueblo one 
year.” 

“I did. But you should see 


Halonawa now. There’s a red and 
purple neon sign twenty feet high 
over the plaza. It reads, “Welcome 
to Halonawa, Home of the Shal- 
ako.’ After that I joined up with 
the Rev. A nice dark Christmas 
seems a wizard idea.” 

He plainly didn’t want to pur- 
sue the subject further. Mazda 
said, “If the Reverend revives in 
time, what’ll we do?” 

“Can you pilot a copter?” 

“I can drive a car.” 

“A copter’s really easier.” He 
gave her directions. “The motor’s 
missing a little, but I don’t think 
you’ll have any trouble. Orient 
yourself by Parker and the dam. 
The dam’s just north of us. 

“If the Rev comes to in time, 
make a break for it with him in 
the plane. I’ll create a diversion 
by climbing out the window and 
shooting at those bloody birds. I 
owe them some arrows, at that.” 
“I wish I knew what they had 
in mind,” Mazda said. 

V 

A T five minutes after three the 
Reverend’s willow-withy body 
stiffened. His eyes opened. He 
raised his head and looked about 
him. “What a lovely day,” he said 
in a pleasant, conversational 
voice. 

Mazda’s face puckered. For a 
moment she seemed about to 
burst into wild tears. Then she 


162 


GALAXY 


blinked her eyes and shook her 
head defiantly. “He hurt his head 
when he fell, that’s all. He’ll be 
all right later. He’s got to be all 
right. And he may really be easier 
to handle this way than if he 
wasn’t goofed. He’s a stubborn 
man.” 

I Joe had gone over to the table 
and was putting out the lamp. He 
handed his red glasses to Mazda. 
“Makes piloting easier,” he said. 
Then he opened the window on 
the left and swung himself out of 
it. He gave a high, passionate 
battle cry. There was a rush of 
feathers and some frenzied 
squawking. Joe’s bow began to 
twang. 

Mazda grabbed the Reverend 
by the hand. “Nice Christmas,” 
she hissed. “Come along.” Bent 
forward, one arm raised to shield 
her eyes, she pulled him after her 
at a run toward the door. 

The night had grown darker. 
The sky was heavily overcast. 
None the less, she could make out 
the improbable shape of the 
copter. “Hurry!” she said to Clem 
Adelburg. “Run!” 

Wings buffeted around her. 
Claws struck at her face, her 
cheeks, her hair. The Reverend 
Adelburg gave a cry of pain; 
Mazda had to use her free arm 
to wipe her own blood from her 
eyes. Then they were in the copter 
and the door was slammed. 

She turned the switch. The 


motor gave a cough and started. 
Mazda was trembling with excite- 
ment, but she followed Joe’s in- 
structions. Slowly the copter rose. 

She had put on the red glasses 
before they left the house. As her 
eyes grew used to the darkness, 
she made out the glimmer of the 
river in front of her and the flat 
surface of Parker dam. She 
wanted to go west, toward Los 
Angeles. The copter climbed a 
little. She tried to turn. 

Wings whizzed by her. Mazda 
grinned. She twisted the blast 
bracelet on her wrist. The tiny 
receptor within it vibrated. There 
was a flash of light, and the bird 
plummeted to the ground. 

When it hit the sand there was 
a faint concussion. The floor of 
the copter shuddered. After a 
second the smell of almond ex- 
tract tinged the air. 

The bird had been carrying a 
cyanide bomb. 

Mazda sent the copter a little 
higher. Her mind was a kaleido- 
scope of tumbling fears. The 
possibility of more bombs, of ex- 
plosive bombs, of a kamekazi 
attack on the copter’s propeller, 
played leap-frog in her brain. And 
what about Joe? Dear Joe, he’d 
been wonderful in Saskatchewan. 
Had they got him yet? 

She looked back anxiously at 
the cabin. Joe had vaulted up 
on the roof and was standing 
with one foot planted on either 


AN OLD FASHIONED BIRD CHRISTMAS 


163 


side of the ridge pole, like a Zuni 
Heracles. The thick clouds be- 
hind him had begun to be tinged 
with light from the rising moon; 
she could see that though his bow 
was ready and he had an arrow 
drawn nearly back to his ear he 
wasn’t shooting. His eyes were 
fixed intently on the sky. 

She followed the direction of 
his gaze. Very high up, so high 
that they looked no bigger than 
crows, seven of the big black 
birds were flapping rapidly north- 
ward in single file. 

f^OR the next five minutes or so 
nothing at all happened. The 
copter plodded steadily westward 
toward Los Angeles, down low, 
along the line of the aqueduct. 
This apparent quiescence on the 
part of her opponents unnerved 
Mazda more than a direct attack 
would have done. She couldn’t 
believe that the PE&G would let 
her and Clem escape so easily. 

Suddenly along the sky in front 
of her there passed a vast flash 
of light. For an instant the desert 
was as bright and white as day. 
Then the darkness closed down 
again and thunder crashed. 

Mazda’s hands shook on the 
controls. The storm that was com- 
ing up might, of course, be merely 
a storm. Or it might have been 
sent by the Company. But if 
Nous . but if Nous . but if 
Nous, that enormous and some- 


how enigmatic power that oper- 
ated from the far side of 3,000 
A.D. ... if Nous had decided to 
stretch out its arm against her 
and Clem, there wasn’t a chance 
in the world that she and the 
Reverend would continue to live. 

There was another prodigious 
lightning flash. The desert, the 
aqueduct, a line of power poles, a 
small square building, burned 
themselves on Mazda’s eyes. 
When darkness came back the 
Reverend, who had been sitting 
quite calmly and quietly beside 
Mazda all this time, stirred. 
“Wonderful fireworks,” he said 
approvingly. 

Mazda’s eyes rolled. “Clem, 
baby,” she said despairingly, 
“what’ll I do?” She looked around 
as if hunting an answer. Then 
the bottom of the heavens 
dropped out. 

The heaviest precipitation re- 
corded to date in a cloudburst is 
two and a half inches in three 
minutes. What fell on the copter 
now was heavier. Inside of two 
seconds after the avalanche of 
water had begun to pour from 
the sky the copter was down flat 
on the ground, as if it had been 
pushed into the sand by a giant 
hand. 

The noise inside the cabin was 
deafening. It was like being a 
dried pea shaken within a drum. 
It beat along the body like ham- 
mers. Mazda, looking up open- 


164 


GALAXY 


mouthed, saw that the copter ceil- 
ing was beginning to bulge. 

The downpour — the cataract — 
stopped as suddenly as it had 
begun. There was a minute of 
dazed silence in the cabin. Then 
Mazda, pushing hard against the 
door in the warped copter body, 
got it open and scrambled out. 

T^HE copter was deep in the 
sand. One blade of the pro- 
peller had been broken off en- 
tirely. The other hung limply 
parallel to the shaft. 

Mazda stood shivering. She 
took off her red glasses absently 
and dropped them on the sand. 
The sky had cleared. The moon 
was almost up. She reached in- 
side the cabin and caught Clem 
Adelburg by the wrist. “C’mon,” 
she said. She had seen a building, 
just before the cloudburst. They 
might be able to take cover in 
that. 

She struggled over the sand 
with the Reverend following 
docilely at her heels. The build- 
ing, once reached, turned out to 
be a Company substation, and 
Mazda felt a touch of hope. She 
could get in, despite the Danger 
and No admittance signs, and the 
ravens might be deterred, even if 
only slightly, by their respect for 
Company property. 

The substation door would 
open to a verbal signal. Mazda 
twisted her blast bracelet twice 


on her arm, inhaled, and swal- 
lowed. “Alameda, Alpine, Ama- 
dor, Butte,” she said carefully. 

Nothing happened. She cleared 
her throat and began again, a 
couple of notes lower. “Alameda, 
Alpine, Amador, Butte.” There 
was a faint click. “Calaveras, 
Colusa, Contra Costa, Del Norte, 
Fresno — ” 

The door swung wide. Mazda’s 
enumeration of the counties of 
California had worked. She took 
the Reverend by the hand and 
led him through the opening. 
“Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, Tuo- 
lomne, Ventura, Yuba, Yolo,” she 
said. The door closed. 

It was much darker inside the 
substation than it had been out- 
side on the white desert, and the 
air was filled with a high hum- 
ming that sounded, and actually 
was exceedingly dangerous. 
Mazda put her arm around Clem’s 
shoulders. “Don’t move, baby,” 
she said pleadingly. “Don’t touch 
anything. Stay close to Mazda 
and be quiet.” 

The Reverend coughed. “Cer- 
tainly, my dear,” he said in quite 
a normal voice, “but would you 
mind telling me where we are? 
And what has been happening?” 

ly/fAZDA went as limp as if she 
had been coshed on the head. 
She clung to him and babbled 
with relief, while the Reverend 
stroked her soothingly on the hair 




AN OLD FASHIONED BIRD CHRISTMAS 


165 


and tried to make sense out of 
her babbling. 

“Yes, my dear,” he said when 
she had finally finished. “Do you 
hear a noise outside?” 

“What sort of a noise?” 

“A sort of whoosh.” 

Mazda drew in her breath. 
“Shin up to the window and look 
out,” she ordered. “Look out espe- 
cially for birds.” 

He was at the high, narrow 
window only an instant before 
he let himself down. “There was 
only one raven,” he reported, 
“but there were a number of 
birds like hawks, with short 
wings. There seemed to be humps 
on their backs.” 

Even in the poor light of the 
substation Mazda visibly turned 
green. “Goshawks!” she gasped. 
Then she began taking off her 
clothes. 

Dress, slip, panties went on the 
floor. She stood on one foot and 
removed her sandals alternately. 
She began going through her hair 
and pulling out bobby pins. She 
took off her blast bracelet and 
added it to the heap. 

“What are you doing that for?” 
the Reverend inquired. It seemed 
to him a singularly ill-chosen 
time. 

“I’m trying to set up a counter- 
charm, and I have to be naked 
to do it.” Her voice was wobbling 
badly. “Those birds — those birds 
are goshawks. I’ve never known 


the Company to send them out 
but once before. Those lumps on 
their backs are portable nous pro- 
jectors. They’re trying to tele- 
port us.” 

“Teleport us? Where to?” 

“To — to the Company’s cellars. 
Where — they attend to people 
who believe in public power. 
They — oh — I can’t talk about it, 
Clem.” 

She crouched down at his feet 
and picked up a bobby pin. “Don’t 
move,” she said without looking 
up. “Try not to think.” 

CJHE began to scratch a diagram 
^around him on the floor with 
the pin. He coughed. “Don’t 
cough,” she cautioned him. “It 
might be better to hold your 
breath.” 

The Reverend’s lungs were 
aching before she got the diagram 
done. She eyed it a moment and 
then spat carefully at four points 
within the hexagram. A faint 
bluish glow sprang up along the 
lines she had traced on the floor. 

Mazda rose to her feet. “It’ll 
hold them for a few minutes,” she 
said. “After that . .” 

The Reverend raised his eyes 
to the rafters. “I’m going to pray,” 
he announced. He filled his lungs. 

“O Lord,” he boomed power- 
fully, “we beg thy blessing to 
preserve me and Mazda from the 
power of the ravens. We beg thy 
blessing to help us stay here and 


166 


GALAXY 


not be transported to the PE&G’s 
cellars. Bless us, O Lord. Preserve 
us. And help us to make thine 
old-fashioned Christmas a living 
reality. Amen, O Lord. Amen!” 

Mazda, too, was praying. Hands 
clasped over her diaphragm, head 
bowed, lips moving silently, she 
besought her bright divinity. 
“Mithras, lord of the morning, 
slayer of the bull of darkness, 
preserve my love and me. Mith- 
ras, lord!” 

Prayer is a force. So is magic. 
So is the energy from nous pro- 
jectors. These varying forces met 
and collided in mid air. 

The collision made a sort of 
vortex, a small but uncomfortable 
knot in the vast, conscious field 
potential that is the Infinite part 
of Nous. There was momently an 
intense, horrible sense of pressure 
and tension in the very air. The 
substation hummed ominously. 
Then, with a burst of energy that 
blew out every generator from 
Tacoma to San Diego, the roof 
came off. 

(The PE&G crews worked 
overtime on the repairs, but there 
were too many wrecked genera- 
tors. All along the Pacific slope, 
and as far inland as Provo, Utah, 
it was as dark a Christmas as 
even the Reverend would have 
wished.) 

There was a pause. The noise 
of breaking timbers died away. 
The Reverend Adelburg and 


Mazda were looking upward 
frozenly, mouths open, necks out- 
stretched. Then a gigantic hand 
reached in through the hole in the 
roof. A gigantic voice, even bigger 
than the hand, said in enormous 
and somehow Oxonian accents, 
“Very well. Take your old-fash- 
ioned Christmas, then.” 

TT was just before sunrise on 
^December 21st. The Christians, 
who would be strangled at dawn 
the next day and then burned in 
honor of the solstice, were gib- 
bering away in their wicker cages. 
There were three cages full of 
them. Great progress was being 
made in stamping out the new 
heresy. The Christians would 
make a fine bright blaze. 

The druid looked up at the 
cages, which were hanging from 
the boughs of three enormous oak 
trees, and nodded with satisfac- 
tion. His consort, Mahurzda, 
would find it a hard job strangling 
so many pedple. He’d have to 
help her. It would be a pleasant 
task. 

Once more he nodded. He 
tested the edge of the sickle he 
was carrying. Then the druid who 
had been — would be — would will 
have been — the Reverend Clem 
Adelburg hoisted up his long 
white robe and clambered up in 
the nearest of the oak trees to 
cut the sacred mistletoe.

THE WAT EE Y WONDEES 


OF CAPTAIN NEMO 

By THEODORE L. THOMAS 


This isn't fiction. 

It concerns the legends all of us have heard about 
the uncanny predictions of J. Verne, Esq. 
Most of them are! 



J ULES VERNE’S 20,000 
Leagues under the Sea was 
published in 1869. Since 
then we have heard a great deal 
about the excellence of the sci- 
ence, speculation and prediction 
it contains. People seem to feel 
that Verne’s sound scientific spec- 
ulation makes the novel good 
science fiction, even though they 
may not care much for it as a 
straight story. 

But these days the waters are 
full of SCUBA divers. (The word 
“SCUBA,” as most people are be- 
ginning to know, is made by tak- 
ing the first letter in each word of 
the phrase “Self-Contained Un- 
derwater Breathing Apparatus.”) 
SCUBA divers carry their own air 
down into water as deep as three 
hundred feet in lakes, oceans, 
streams, rivers, bays, quarries and 
caves all over the world. There is 
a rash of books on the subject, 
and many SCUBA divers are 
fairly well-versed in the history of 
man’s descent beneath the water. 
When a SCUBA diver takes a 
critical look at 20,000 Leagues 
under the Sea, a new interpreta- 
tion of the novel emerges. 

The novel isn’t at all what liter- 
ary critics have said it is. 

The diving gear and the diving 
scenes are technically pretty bad, 
behind the times even for 1869. 
The submarine Nautilus itself is 
out of date for 1869, with the sole 
exception that electricity is the 


source of power. In none of these 
technical situation did Verne 
take advantage of knowledge 
readily available to him at the 
time. It is as if he sat in his chair 
and dashed off his concepts with- 
out bothering to get up and check 
facts that must have been in 
books in the same room with him. 
He spun his yarn from the mate- 
rial in his head. And there you 
have a clue to the real value of 
the novel. 

Verne was a mighty story-tel- 
ler. His science was bad, his 
speculation absurd, and even his 
plot and his characters might be 
poor. No matter. Put them all to- 
gether with the magic of Verne’s 
story-telling ability, and some- 
thing flames up. A story emerges 
that sweeps incredulity before it. 

TT is a very difficult thing to 
read this novel in a hostile 
frame of mind, looking for the 
blunders, noting all the scientific 
misinformation. For one thing, 
Verne uses a nifty device for pre- 
senting much of the so-called 
scientific data in the novel. He 
will have one of the characters, 
say the narrator, Professor Aron- 
nax, poised on the brink of some 
exciting event, and then he will 
ladle in the scientific nonsense. 
In this posture of the story, who 
stops to think about science? 
Verne can get away with almost 
anything, and he does. 


THE WATERY WONDERS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 


169 


The power of Verne’s story- 
telling ability shows up in another 
odd way. After reading the novel, 
people remember things from it 
that are not there. The impres- 
sion that the novel contains valid 
scientific prediction seems to 
grow as the years roll by. Re- 
cently, a United States Patent 
Office official received an inter- 
esting inquiry. Was it true that a 
patent examiner had rejected the 
patent application of an inventor 
of a new periscope because of the 
periscope described by Jules 
Verne in 20,000 Leagues under 
the Sea? Well, the fact is that 
Verne is totally silent on the sub- 
ject of periscopes in the novel. 
The Nautilus had no periscope. 

Another mis-remembered de- 
scription concerns the storage bat- 
teries used aboard the Nautilus. 
There are none. The only time 
Verne specifically mentions a bat- 
tery is in connection with diving 
dress; Captain Nemo says the bat- 
tery makes electricity out of 
sodium instead of the usual bi- 
chromate of potash. The novel 
leaves readers with the impres- 
sion that it is a storehouse of ad- 
vanced technology, and the im- 
pression grows as the reader ages. 
(It would be interesting to find 
out how many adults reread it 
after having read it in their teens. 
Libraries tend to carry it in the 
section for younger readers.) 

Probably the best parts of the 


novel are those which describe the 
activities of the characters as they 
roam on the bottom of the sea in 
their SCUBA gear. Verne was not 
concerned with many of the dan- 
gers guarded against by modern 
SCUBA divers, things like air em- 
bolism, nitrogen narcosis and the 
bends. That’s all right. Diving was 
not sufficiently far advanced for 
these things to be of concern. It 
wasn’t until the 1870s that the 
Frenchman Paul Bert completed 
the 1660 work of the Englishman 
Robert Boyle. Bert put out a book 
on diving physiology describing 
how nitrogen can bubble out of a 
diver’s blood when the diver 
comes up too fast. Bert was the 
man who pointed out the ways to 
avoid the bends. The diver could 
recompress in a chamber at the 
surface in order to relieve the 
pressure slowly and at will, or the 
diver could come up slowly and 
in stages. Both of these systems 
allowed the excess nitrogen in the 
blood to be thrown off in the ex- 
haled air. Verne could not pos- 
sibly know about such things, 
and the lack of discussion of such 
diving dangers in the novel can- 
not be held against him. 

HPHE SCUBA used by Captain 
Nemo and his crew has long 
been held up as a good example 
of Verne’s ability to forecast sci- 
entifically. Even Verne himself in 
his later years forgot that Captain 


170 


GALAXY 


Nemo says, when he first de- 
scribes the diving apparatus to 
Professor Aronnax, “It is to use 
the Rouquayrol apparatus, in- 
vented by two of your own coun- 
trymen, which I have brought to 
perfection for my own use.” The 
two “countrymen” are Rouquay- 
rol, a mining engineer, and Den- 
ayrouze, a Navy officer. Their 
SCUBA gear was in use in 1865, 
four years before Verne published 
his novel. In the actual gear, an 
air hose ran from a compressor on 
the surface down to a tank car- 
ried on the driver’s back. A second 
hose ran from the tank to a 
mouthpiece through which the 
diver breathed. Some kind of 
valve on the tank fed the com- 
pressed air to the mouthpiece at 
a pressure about equal to the 
pressure of the water at that 
depth. Once the diver’s tank was 
charged, the diver could unplug 
the hose that ran to the surface 
and freely walk around a bit using 
the air in his tank. He could then 
return to the hose and plug in 
again for another charge of air. 

Apparently Verne had heard 
about the gear, although toward 
the end of his life he insisted he 
had dreamed about it. For use in 
the novel, he made some changes 
in the gear without bothering to 
check the gear itself, or even to 
think much about it. For one 
thing, Captain Nemo says, “I, in 
encountering great pressures at 


the bottom of the sea, was obliged 
to shut my head, like that of a 
diver, in a ball of copper.” This 
was nothing new, either. The 
closed-helmet diving dress had 
been in steady use since its inven- 
tion by Augustus Siebe in 1840 
... a diving dress so good that 
nothing more than refinements 
have been added to it to this very 
day. Verne adds an innovation to 
the helmet in the novel. “In the 
Rouquayrol apparatus such as 
we use, two india-rubber pipes 
leave this box and join a sort of 
tent which holds the nose and 
mouth; one is to introduce fresh 
air, and the other to let out the 
foul, and the tongue closes one 
or the other according to the 
wants of the respirator.” 

Apparently Verne was not 
aware of the existence of check 
valves, so he requires that the 
diver use his tongue to control the 
incoming and outgoing air. Yet 
check valves were in use in the 
Siebe diving helmet 29 years 
earlier, in 1840. Verne simply did 
not bother to get out of his chair 
and check. On top of that, he for- 
gets that his SCUBA gear has no 
check valves. On that first walk 
on the bottom of the sea, Profes- 
sor Aronnax, Captain Nemo, Con- 
seil and one of the crew were out 
under the water for a total of ten 
hours. Toward the end of that 
walk they all get sleepy and take 
a little nap. Things have been 


THE WATERY WONDERS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 


171 


happening so fast and furiously 
that both Verne and the reader 
alike forget that Verne’s SCUBA 
gear demands that the tongue al- 
ternately pop into and out of the 
two breathing tubes, a good trick 
when one is asleep. 

f T'HEN there is the matter of air 
consumption. The modem 
SCUBA diver exhausts each 
breath into the water, except in 
the rarely-used rebreather types 
of diving gear. Verne properly 
saw that air does not last very 
long when you breathe it once 
and blow it out into the water, so 
he said that his divers would 
breathe the same air over and 
over. Each diver would carry a 
tank of air charged by “the 
pumps of the Nautilus” to a pres- 
sure of “fifty atmospheres.” The 
71.2 cubic foot tank of a modern 
SCUBA diver is charged to a 
pressure of 153 atmospheres, and 
most of us run in a little more. 
Such a charge will last for 25 
minutes at a depth of 100 feet. 
Verne needed to keep his divers 
going for ten hours. 

Early in the novel Professor 
Aronnax points out that a man 
“consumes, in one hour, the oxy- 
gen contained in more than 176 
pints of air, and this air, charged 
(as then) with a nearly equal 
quantity of carbonic acid, be- 
comes unbreathable.” (The 
French version of the novel states 


the quantity of air as 100 liters; 
this accounts for the odd preci- 
sion of the equivalent in British 
pints.) 

In ten hours, Verne’s divers 
would each need 1760 pints of air. 
This converts into 0.71 cubic feet 
of air at the specified 50 atmos- 
pheres, assuming air to be a per- 
fect gas, and is a nice convenient 
quantity to carry on one’s back. 
It weighs about 2.59 pounds, and 
it contains only about 0.54 
pounds of oxygen. Professor 
Aronnax also says about the air 
they will breathe during the dive, 
“when it only contains fifteen per 
cent of oxygen, it is no longer fit 
to breathe.” This leaves a total of 
0.15 pounds of consumable oxy- 
gen for each man for a ten-hour 
period, about one-tenth the oxy- 
gen needed by a 150-pound man 
engaged in very mild exercise at 
atmospheric pressure. This man 
would also generate 1.25 pounds 
of carbon dioxide in a ten-hour 
period, producing with the 1760 
pints of air an atmosphere con- 
taining about 48.3 per cent car- 
bon dioxide. This would swiftly 
kill him. 

If the 0.54 pounds of oxygen 
available in the tank were con- 
verted to carbon dioxide, the 
diver’s atmosphere would still 
contain 20.8 per cent carbon 
dioxide, enough to kill quickly. A 
carbon dioxide concentration of 
6 per cent causes distress, and 10 


172 


GALAXY 


per cent produces unconscious- 
ness. 

There are other interesting 
details about the breathing 
arrangements of Verne’s divers. 
Exhaled air goes back into the 
portable tank on the diver’s back 
so it can be used again. But the 
tank is stated to be maintained at 
a pressure of 50 atmospheres. We 
are not told how a human being 
could possibly exhale into a 
chamber maintained at such a 
high pressure. In any case, one 
passage of air through human 
lungs reduces the oxygen content 
to about 15 per cent, at which 
point Verne says, pretty cor- 
rectly, it is no longer fit to 
breathe. 

"INTERNE frequently mentions 
’ water pressure throughout 
the novel. If you look for it, it 
becomes apparent that Verne has 
no clear idea of the effects of 
water pressure on immersed ob- 
jects, or even how diving gear of 
any kind works. The diving dress 
for his divers is “made of india- 
rubber without seam, and con- 
structed expressly to resist con- 
siderable pressure. One would 
have thought it a suit of armor, 
both supple and resisting.” 
Verne therefore does not know 
that the air pressure inside the 
suit balances the water pressure 
outside the suit, and that the suit 
does not have to resist “consider- 


able pressure” at all. In fact, the 
suit is quite flexible, which Verne 
realizes in a vague sort of way. 
Not understanding this principle 
of the balancing of pressures, he 
feels compelled to offer some ex- 
planation of how a diver can exist 
under great water pressure in a 
flexible suit. So he talks about the 
suit’s “resisting.” 

In one scene Professor Aron- 
nax is looking out the great win- 
dow in the saloon of the Nautilus. 
The Nautilus is deep, and the 
Professor sees a sunken ship sus- 
pended in mid-water. It had sunk 
to a depth where its density 
equaled the water density, and 
there it hung, according to Verne. 
The good Professor says, “we 
often saw the hulls of ship- 
wrecked vessels that were rotting 
in the depths, and, deeper down, 
cannons, bullets, anchors, chains 
and a thousand other iron mate- 
rials eaten up by rust.” What he 
means is, heavier objects come to 
rest suspended in water at depths 
deeper than light objects. Verne 
believes that sinking objects all 
seek their own levels in the 
depths, each according to its dens- 
ity, and there they hover. 

As a matter of fact, water is 
incompressible for all practical 
purposes; its density does not 
change much in the oceans. At the 
deepest parts of the oceans, at 
depths of some 36,000 feet — al- 
most 1,100 atmospheres — the 


THE WATERY WONDERS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 


173 


enormous pressure increases the 
density only by some six per cent. 
Verne’s false idea of the effect of 
the depth on the density of water 
shows up in the novel every so 
often. At one point Professor 
Aronnax notes that the trans-At- 
lantic cable rests on the bottom 
in deep water “without anchor- 
age”. Whenever the Nautilus is to 
make an unusually deep dive, 
“the screw set to work at its maxi- 
mum speed” in order to drive the 
Nautilus down into that “dense” 
water. Once down, all the Nau- 
tilus has to do to reach the surface 
again is to shut off its screw and 
tip its vanes upwards. It shoots to 
the surface, squeezed up like a 
slug of toothpaste from a tooth- 
paste tube. In describing the 
strength of any animals living in 
water strata miles beneath the 
surface, Professor Aronnax says, 
“it requires incalculable strength 
to keep one’s self in these strata 
and resist their pressure.” Scien- 
tists knew better in those days. 

The Nautilus itself, as a sub- 
marine, does not represent any- 
thing new in the submarine' art, 
with the exception of the idea of 
using electricity for power. Cap- 
tain Nemo says that he extracts 
sodium from sea water and makes 
electricity out of it. Everything 
aboard is run by electricity. But 
even this speculation is not signi- 
ficant, since the work of men like 
Volta, Ampere, Cavendish, Hen- 


ry, Joule, Ohm, Davy, Coulomb, 
Faraday, Watt and others was 
completed years before 1869. An 
American inventor, Thomas Dav- 
enport, patented the first electric 
motor. He ran a railroad car with 
it in 1839. So the use of electri- 
city aboard the Nautilus did not 
call for the exercise of the ima- 
gination. 

V ERNE’S Nautilus was named 
after Robert Fulton’s Nautil- 
us, built in 1800 in France, and 
it was more than named after it. 
Fulton’s Nautilus had an observa- 
tion dome protruding from the 
upper deck, just like the one on 
Verne’s Nautilus 69 years later. 
In 1855 a German named Wil- 
helm Bauer launched a subma- 
rine fifty-seven feet long. It was 
named the Sea Devil, and it car- 
ried a crew of thirteen. It was 
built to dive to 150 feet, and it 
had an oxygen-regenerating sys- 
tem, an observation dome at the 
bow, and an air lock so that a 
diver could enter and leave under 
water. All this was fourteen years 
before Verne’s Nautilus. Once a 
day it was necessary for Verne’s 
Nautilus to surface to replenish 
her air. She carried pressure tanks 
for air storage, but no air-regen- 
erating system. 

Early in the novel Captain 
Nemo takes Professor Aronnax 
on a tour of the Nautilus. At the 
end of this tour the reader sup- 


174 


GALAXY 


poses he has learned something 
about how the Nautilus operates. 
This isn’t true. We learn, “This 
engine room, clearly lighted, did 
not measure less than sixty-five 
feet in length. It was divided into 
two parts; the first contained the 
materials for producing electri- 
city, and the second the machin- 
ery that connected it with the 
screw.” Then Captain Nemo tells 
us, “I use Bunsen’s contributions, 
not Ruhmkorff’s. Bunsen’s are 
fewer in number, but strong and 
large, which experience proves to 
be best. The electricity produced 
passes forward, where it works by 
electro-magnets of great size, on 
a system of levers and cogwheels 
that transmit the movement to 
the axle of the screw.” And we 
never again hear anything about 
the front part of the room where 
the electricity is produced. In 
fact, the only feature we learn 
about the back room is that the 
system of levers and cogwheels 
turns the screw a hundred and 
twenty revolutions in a second, 
which gives the Nautilus a speed 
of fifty miles per hour — as you 
might well imagine. This “Bunsen 
and Ruhmkorff” business seems 
to be thrown in for the distinction 
gained from the use of a couple 
of shining scientific names. Bun- 
sen, among many other things, in- 
vented an electric cell that used 
plates of gas coke instead of plati- 
num, but Captain Nemo does not 


seem to be talking about batteries 
here. Ruhmkorff invented an in- 
duction coil in 1851. 

Anyhow, this is all we find out 
about the mechanism that drives 
this most famous of submarines. 
It isn’t much. Yet, thinking back 
to the description after the lapse 
of a few years, it seems rosily 
complete. 

VV/ r HEN the tour is over, Cap- 
tain Nemo and Professor 
Aronnax sit down in the saloon 
while the captain describes more 
details of the Nautilus’s construc- 
tion. Most of these involve dimen- 
sions of the ship. It is here that 
we learn the secret of the enor- 
mous strength of the Nautilus’s 
hull, a strength that allows the 
vessel to dive to depths of several 
miles once it gets up enough 
power. The hull is double. “In- 
deed, owing to this cellular ar- 
rangement it resists like a block, 
as if it were solid. Its side cannot 
yield; it coheres spontaneously, 
and not by the closeness of its 
rivets; and the homogeneity of its 
construction, due to the perfect 
union of the materials, enables it 
to defy the roughest seas.” So, 
for those reasons, the double hull 
accounts for the great strength of 
the Nautilus . apparently on the 
theory that if one shell is good, 
two must be better. 

Captain Nemo continues to 
give figures, physical dimensions 


THE WATERY WONDERS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 


175 


and properties of materials, which 
again seem to impart something 
scientific. Here there occurs the 
remark, “steel plates, whose dens- 
ity is from .7 to .8 that of water.” 
One translation has “.07 to .08 
that of water.” A non-technical 
reader might see nothing wrong, 
and even a technical reader might 
slip over the grossly understated 
density of steel. Verne doesn’t 
really mean it, either; he is not 
giving us a science-fiction descrip- 
tion of lighter-than-water steel. 
In these paragraphs he also states 
the weight and dimension of the 
outer shell, so it is pretty easy to 
calculate the density of his steel 
for ourselves. 

It works out to be the normal 
heavy steel we are used to, and 
not the light stuff he says it is. 

While discussing the strength 
of the hull, Captain Nemo men- 
tions that at a depth of 1,000 feet 
of water, the walls of the Nautilus 
bear a pressure of 100 atmos- 
pheres. But, as every SCUBA 
diver knows, water pressure in- 
creases an additional atmosphere 
for every 33 feet of depth, not 
every 10 feet. So at 1,000 feet of 
water the pressure on the hull of 
the Nautilus would be a total of 
31.3 atmospheres, not 100. This 
same sort of mistake occurs dur- 
ing that first walk on the bottom 
of the ocean. Professor Aronnax 
tells us, “We were at a depth of a 
hundred and five yards and 


twenty inches, undergoing a pres- 
sure of six atmospheres.” But this 
depth of 316 feet produces a total 
pressure of 10.6 atmospheres. 

In this instance Verne thinks 
every 53 feet of depth produces 
an additional atmosphere of 
water pressure, while previously 
he thought every 10 feet did so. 
Yet in the opening pages of the 
novel Professor Aronnax explains 
to Ned Land, “the pressure of the 
atmosphere is represented by the 
weight of a column of water 
thirty-two feet high.” This is just 
about right; Verne has the correct 
datum, but he doesn’t bother to 
use it later. 

The book frequently reports 
popular fallacy as if it were scien- 
tific fact. For instance, Professor 
Aronnax muses that the huge 
mass of wooden material, includ- 
ing wrecked ships, floating in the 
central point of the Sargasso Sea 
“will become petrified by the 
action of the water, and will then 
form inexhaustable coal mines.” 
A clue as to why such nonsense 
should be in the novel can be 
found about halfway through. 
Professor Aronnax knocks on the 
door of Captain Nemo’s room. He 
is invited in. He enters and “found 
Captain Nemo deep in algebraic 
calculations of x and other quan- 
tities.” Now, nobody with even a 
smattering of mathematics would 
put it that way. People don’t sit 
around calculating “x and other 


176 


GALAXY 


quantities” as an end in itself. 
Such a remark could only be 
made by a man with no mathe- 
matical background whatsoever. 
Verne trained as a lawyer, and 
then for awhile he thought about 
going into the banking business. 
Any knowledge of science he had 
must have rubbed off on him, and 
very thinly at that. 

1W/E have been talking about 
” Verne’s physical science. 
There is good reason to suspect 
that his biological science is just 
as bad. It doesn’t have the right 
flavor. The crew of the Nautilus 
throw out a net, say in the Indian 
Ocean, and haul it back loaded. 
Professor Aronnax looks in the 
net and says something like, “I 
saw in the net . .” and there will 
follow a listing of the sea crea- 
tures in the net, anywhere from 
one paragraph to three pages 
long. It is as if Verne pulled to- 
ward him a text on marine biol- 
ogy, turned to the listing “Flora 
and Fauna of the Indian Ocean.” 

This sort of thing goes on fre- 
quently in various bodies of 
water. Verne has his man look in 
the net and rattle off what he 
sees there. Sometimes, as a varia- 
tion, Professor Aronnax stands at 
the window while the Nautilus 
cruises beneath the surface, and 
calls off the contents of the sea 
they are passing through. 

All through the novel occur re- 


marks that show a lack of infor- 
mation on a particular subject — 
information, that is, which could 
have been obtained easily enough 
by asking or looking. One mile 
visibility under water. Good natu- 
ral light at 150 fathoms. 7,000 
fathom depth of water in the 
Indian Ocean. It goes on and on. 

It is time to emphasize again 
that Verne is a great story-teller 
despite his scientific and specula- 
tive nonsense. The novel is 
sprinkled with arresting thoughts. 
Professor Aronnax wonders if 
some day there will be cities at 
the bottom of the oceans, cities 
that rise to the surface once a day 
to replenish their air as the Nau- 
tilus does. Later on, in a conversa- 
tion between Captain Nemo and 
Professor Aronnax, they discuss 
the possibility of excavating the 
portion of the bottom of the Red 
Sea where the Pharaoh’s army 
perished while pursuing Moses 
and the Israelites; such an exca- 
vation ought to “bring to light a 
large number of arms and instru- 
ments of Egyptian origin.” What 
a lovely concept! 

As a novel, 20,000 Leagues Un- 
der the Sea is a good story. But 
there is not a single bit of valid 
speculation in it; none of its pre- 
dictions has come true. The pur- 
ported science in it is not semi- 
science or even pseudo-science. It 
is non-science.

You could say Jonesey and/or I were not 
all there , but I don't see it that way. 
How much of Stanley was or wasn't there? 


H AVE you ever been clear 
down there on skid row? 
Oh, sure, every city has 
one and no doubt you have given 
it one of those look-away-quick 
side glances. That isn’t what I 
mean. 

What I mean is, have you ever 
Probably not. And, if you 
haven’t, I could make a sugges- 
been really down there? 
tion. Don’t go. 

Skid row is a far, remote way 
and there are all kinds of hor- 
rors down there, the seen and 
the unseen. To each his own, as 
they say, and everyone there has 
his own personal collection. All 
right. General opinion is to let 
them be there and the hell with 
them, people and horrors too, if 
there is a distinction. Unfortu- 
nate, but what can you do? Noth- 


ing. Look the other way. That’s 
all right with me. I don’t know 
anything better to do about the 
horrors that are, or that may be 
on skid row than to hope they 
will stay there where they be- 
long — and let me forget them. 

That’s why I’m writing this. I 
want to do the story of what 
I saw, and what I think I saw 
or felt, and what I didn’t see, to 
get it off my mind. Then I am 
going to do my damnedest not 
to think of the whole thing. 

Me, I know about skid row be- 
cause I was there. That’s my 
personal problem and another 
story, before this one, and the 
hell with that, too. I once had 
a wife and a couple of kids. I 
had a lot of problems and then 
no wife and no kids and I made 
it to skid row. It was easy. For 


THE LITTLE MAN 
WHO WASN’T QUITE 


178 


GALAXY 


a while I was there, all the way 
down, where the gutter was 
something I could look up to. 
Well, turned out I had friends 
who wouldn’t quit. By their ef- 
forts plus, as they say, the grace 
of God, I came off it; most of the 
way off it, at least. No credit to 
me, but not too many ever man- 
age to make a round trip of it. 

Who are the misfits and dere- 
licts on skid row? Anybody; no- 
body. Individuals, if they are in- 
dividuals, come and go. The 
group, with few exceptions, is 
always the same. It is built of 
the world’s rejects — lost souls, 
bad dreams; shadowy, indistinct 
shapes, not a part of life nor yet 
quite altogether out of it, either. 

I was down there. I left. But 
I kept passing by every once in 
a while to pay a little visit. For 
that I had two reasons. One, I 
could sometimes pick up a lead 
on something for a Sunday fea- 
ture for my paper. The other — 
just taking another look now 
and then at where and what I 
had been was a sort of insurance 
for me. 

from time to time I would 
^ stop by The Yard for an eve- 
ning. I would spring for a jug. I 
was welcome. Those in the regu- 
lar group knew me and they held 
me in no more than the same 
contempt they had for each 
other and themselves. Being no 


stranger — or, perhaps, not too 
much less strange — I fitted well 
enough with the misfits of that 
half-world where the individual 
rarely stands out enough to be 
noticeable. 

Wino Jones, though, and his 
friend Stanley were, each in his 
own way, quite noticeable. 

I first ran across Wino Jones 
and Stanley one early spring eve- 
ning. It was a Thursday. I was 
beat. It had been a tough week 
— a political scandal, a couple 
of fires and a big “Missing Kid — 
Fiend” scare. Turned out the 
kid had skipped school to catch 
a triple-feature horror show 
and was scared to go home when 
she came out late, so she went 
to hide out at Grandma’s. The 
suspect fiend was a cockfight 
sportsman from the Caribbean 
colony smuggling home his loser 
under his leather jacket. 

But it had been a rough week 
with a lot of chasing around and 
getting no place that left me in 
one of those hell-with-it moods. 
Like, maybe, I ought to take a 
week or so off and — and the 
hell with that. It was time for 
me to pay a little remembrance- 
of- things -not -so -far -past visit 

down on the row. 

I left the city room, tired, 
dirty, needing a shave. Where I 
was headed, this would put me 
ahead of the fashion parade, but 
it would serve. I stopped for a

bowl of chili at Mad Miguel’s 
and then wandered down to 
those four blocks on South River 
Street, known as Bug Alley, that 
make up the hard-core skid-row 
section of our city. 

Across from St. Vincent’s in 
Scott Square, called the Yard, 
by the old wall, there was a group 
of six or eight passing the time 
and a nearly dead jug. I 
shambled over and squatted 
down. Got a hard, bloodshot look 
or two, but not because the jug 
in the public park was against 
the law. Even if I was the law, 
so what? These, they made the 
jail now and then, if there were 
too many complaints, if they 
made a disturbance. But not 
even the jail wanted them. The 
hard looks wondered only if the 
jug should be passed to me or 
by me. 

I lit a cigarette, took a couple 
of drags and handed it on. Boot- 
nose Bailey, big, old, bald, with 
the cast-iron stomach and 
leather liver, settled the jug 
question by handing it to me. I 
lifted it, letting only the smallest 
trickle of the sticky sweet cheap 
wine past. It is not for me; no 
more. It is sickening stuff. But, 
as always, the effort of holding 
back left me shaking. All right; 
with shaking, I had plenty of 
company. The next man looked 
pleased at the two gulps left in 
the bottle and drained it. 


“Ed?” Bootnose asked in his 
hoarse canned-heat whisper. 
“You gonna spring for a jug?” 

I squatted a minute or so and 
then stood and started fumbling 
around through all my pockets. 
This is local protocol. Coin by 
coin, I spread a dollar and a half 
in silver out on the flat collec- 
tion stone in front of me. A huge, 
powerful-looking colored man, 
new to me, hunkered down 
against the wall, smiled gently 
and added a quarter. Bootnose 
scooped it up and went to make 
the run for the jug. 

T WAS, I guess, stretching the 

ground rules a little by the 
way I stared at the big fellow. 
But he surprised me mildly. For 
one thing, he looked in good 
shape; strong, no shakes, no fe- 
vered ghosts back of the blood- 
shot curtain of the eyes. And, 
apart from that, you don’t find 
very many Negroes on skid row, 
at least in our area. I don’t know 
why. 

“Jones,” he said, softly, po- 
litely, “Wino Jones. You’re Ed? 
Ed, this here is my friend Stan- 
ley.” He waved a big hand at a 
wispy little man beside him. 

Funny I hadn’t seen Stanley 
before, but there he was. That I 
want to make clear. Stanley was 
there; no question about it. Only 
he was such a totally remote, 
insignificant, unobtrusive little 


180 


GALAXY 


man, it is hard for me to remem- 
ber him even now. Hard to 
remember what he was like, that 
is. He wasn’t colored. He was 
small. His eyes, his hair, I don’t 
know. He must have had some 
or I would have noticed. And he 
had a sort of sour, distant, hurt 
bitterness about him, I recall, 
and that is about all I can recall 
ever seeing in Stanley. Except for 
the last time I saw him — he 
looked mean then. 

This time, I smiled and nod- 
ded. “Wino Jones, Stanley, wel- 
come to our city, our little garden 
spot.” 

“There now, Stanley,” Jones 
beamed, “he can see you well 
enough. You’re doing fine, Stan- 
ley, getting better all the time. 
You do see him plain, don’t you, 
Ed?” 

“Huh? Yeah, sure I see him. 
Why not? Does he think he’s 
invi — ” 

Jones interrupted me, “Look, 
there comes Mr. Bailey back al- 
ready.” 

Well, it was a little odd. But 
then, down there the odd is 
normal, the normal odd. I didn’t 
think anything of it. 

I sat a couple of hours. One 
jug went and then another. Jt 
did seem to me that Wino Jones 
missed by a lot on proving out 
his nickname. At least he didn’t 
love up the passing bottle as 
though it might be the last one 


in the world — which, as every 
skid-row pro desperately fears, it 
might very well turn out to be. 
• Stanley’s drinking? I didn’t no- 
tice. 

After a while I wandered off. 
My appreciation of the fact that 
I was able to wander off was 
shored up again and I was glad 
enough to get back to work the 
next day without thinking any- 
thing much more about it. 

I didn’t think about Wino 
Jones or Stanley again till the 
first of the next week. Then I 
was on early shift at the paper, 
due in at six A.M. At quarter to, 
I yawned my way out of Mad 
Miguel’s after coffee, an egg and 
hotcakes. Mig’s hotcakes were 
hot, too; made them with chili. 
Hard on the stomach, but they 
popped the old eyelids open in 
the morning. As I stood a minute 
in the doorway, my watering 
eyes spotted Wino Jones coming 
out of the alley that led around 
to Mig’s kitchen side. He saw 
me but, thoughtfully, didn’t 
crack till I gave him a, consider- 
ing the time, reasonably bright 
hello. 

“How’s it, Ed? You going on 
early, uh?” 

“Yeah, Wino — ah — Jonesy. 
Mind if I call you Jonesy?” He 
didn’t. “What’s with you? Been 
washing a dish for the Mig?” 

He nodded. Some of the up- 
per-level boys from the row 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


181 


worked off and on at odd jobs 
like that. It didn’t make Jones 
unique, but it made him stand 
out a little. 

“Me and Stanley, we like a 
little change in our pockets. 
Right, Stanley?” 

He looked down and a little to 
one side, just as though he were 
asking agreement from someone. 
Only there wasn’t anyone there. 
There wasn’t anyone in sight on 
the block but Jones and me. 

T>UT Jones smiled and nodded 
warmly at the short vacancy 
beside him and then looked back 
at me. “Stanley here, he come 
by to meet me after work. Mr. 
Mig, he let me fix us a bite of 
breakfast when I finish up the 
night.” 

I looked again at where 
Stanley was supposed to be 
standing and then, blankly, back 
at Jones. He shrugged almost 
unnoticeably and, I thought, 
barely shook his head. 

“Well-1 — ” he said, “I expect 
me and Stanley better drift back 
on down to the Yard before 
some fuzz comes along and fans 
us down.” 

“Yeah?” I said. “Yeah. So 
long, Jonesy — Stanley.” 

I don’t know why I added the 
“Stanley” but, obscurely, it 
seemed to please Jones. He gave 
me a big smile and then walked 
off down the street, chatting 


companionably to — no one. I 
didn’t get it. Well, Stanley pres- 
ent or absent rated very low on 
the list of the problems I was 
going to worry about. I went to 
work. 

I ran into Jones every morning 
during the week I was on early; 
Jones, coming off work, with 
Stanley — who wasn’t there. 
Odd, sure. But if Jones was 
stringing a way-out gag or play- 
ing with a mild hallucination, 
still it was nothing to me. 

I did mention it to Mig, who 
only said, “Si, these one big 
hombre eat big. He like two 
plate eat for breakfast, plate he 
wash, bueno, what for I com- 
plain?” 

So that was all. Nothing. 

Toward the end of the next 
week, I wandered down to the 
Yard again and joined the little 
group of exponents of gracious 
almost-living by the wall. Jones 
wasn’t there. But as I was set- 
tling down I glanced over at the 
Broad Street side of the square 
and I saw him strolling along 
toward us. He was smiling, talk- 
ing, gesturing. He was alone. I 
looked twice. There was no one 
with Jones. 

I settled down, took a drag or 
two on a smoke and passed it 
along. Lifted a jug. Got back the 
old lost, gone, miserable feel of 
the thing again. I looked up then 
at Jones who was just coming 


182 


GALAXY 


around the mangy clump of 
bushes by the path. With him 
was a sour, whispy, scarcely 
noticeable little man. Stanley. 

“Evening, Jonesy,” I said, 
“and Stanley. Good to see you 
again.” I meant it even though, 
come to think, it didn’t really 
clear anything up. Jones gave 
me his smile and Stanley nod- 
ded suspiciously. 

They moved in and joined the 
group. Somebody made a run; a 
couple. The talk staggered 
around as usual. Topics: booze; 
money, yesterday’s and tomor- 
row’s; booze; women — only 
occasionally and with mild, de- 
cayed interest; booze. 

Jones put in a soft word or 
two from time to time until he 
finally stood up, stretched and 
said he was going up to Mig’s. 
Stanley stayed. I know he did. 
I watched him. Afterward, I 
tried to remember if he said 
anything, but that I couldn’t re- 
call. 

I went on home myself a 
while after Jones left. Stanley 
was still there, though, when I 
glanced back from Broad Street, 
I couldn’t pick him out in the 
dim moon and street light. 

Still nothing much, eh? 

nPHE NEXT week I came on 
work at ten and I didn’t see 
Jones — or not see Stanley — 
all week. Friday, I was back 


down at the Yard. That was out 
of my pattern. Usually one visit 
in a month or so was plenty. But 
now, for whatever reason, I was 
getting kind of interested in 
Jones — and Stanley. 

This time Jones was there 
hunkered down against the wall 
when I wandered up. Coaster 
Joe squatted on one side of him. 
On the other side, no one. I 
looked; I looked close. There 
was no one there. Still, when I 
nodded around, I nodded at the 
empty space. Noticed that Boot- 
nose Bailey was missing. A mild 
surprise. Bootnose and a bottle 
were nearly as much Yard fix- 
tures as Gen. Scott in bronze 
and pigeons. I settled in. A little 
time and a jug went by. I still 
didn’t see Stanley. 

My curiosity finally insisted 
on a remark. “Jonesy, I — 
haven’t seen Stanley tonight.” 
Jones smiled, not quite as 
easy and relaxed as usual. “Stan- 
ley isn’t around tonight. He 
went someplace.” 

“Oh? Well, that’s good." It 
seemed a safe statement. If 
Stanley had been in jail, Jones 
would have said so. Any other 
place was bound to be better. I 
was being unjustifiably nosy, but 
curiosity wouldn’t let me drop 
it. “Where did he go?” 

Jones shrugged. Then, seri- 
ously, “To tell the truth, Ed, I 
don’t rightly know. Fact is, I 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


183 


been a mite worried about old 
Stanley lately.” 

No one else was paying any 
attention to us. “So? How’s 
that?” 

“Well — ” He shrugged again 
and then made a decision. “You 
know, Ed, it’s a sort of a odd 
thing about Stanley. If you have 
a little time . ?” 

“Time is what I have.” 

Jones sighed. “It might turn 
out to be a problem, I think. 
Bothers me some. It would be a 
kindness if you would let me 
talk to you about it.” 

I stood up. Jones, making a 
gesture that clearly set him 
apart, put a quarter on the flat 
collection stone as he got up to 
join me. We strolled off through 
the dusk in the park, quietly. 
Jones, even in a state of some 
unease, was a comfortable pres- 
ence. Over on the Broad Street 
side of the Yard, we sat down 
on a bench. 

“Don’t rightly know how to 
begin,” Jones said, scratching his 
head with a fielder’s-mitt-sized 
hand, “but — Ed, I expect you 
noticed something funny about 
Stanley? Or maybe about me?” 
“I noticed that sometimes I 
see Stanley and sometimes I 
don’t. And that sometimes you 
act as though you see him when 
he positively is not there.” 

“Um, yes. Makes you kind of 
unusual too, Ed. Because with 


Stanley it is mostly like this — 
when he is around, I mean. 
There are people who see him; 
a few. But most people, they 
can’t see Stanley at all. With 
you, seems like it changes. Up- 
town you can’t see him; down 
here you can.” 

“What?” 

“Now me, I see him most all 
the time. All the time when he’s 
around, that is; when he hasn’t 
gone off someplace, like tonight. 
But most people, what you might 
call really normal people — no 
offense, Ed — they can’t ever 
see Stanley.” 

TT SOUNDED silly. But Jones 

said it with a calm conviction 
that carried weight. If I couldn’t 
believe it exactly, I didn’t dis- 
believe him either. You hear 
plenty of queer stories on skid 
row — dreams, nightmares, non- 
sense. There used to be one 
crummy, rummy old bum around 
called Gov’nor who used to 
claim he really had been a 
governor. He drank down some 
office duplicator fluid and died. 
Police routine checked. He was 
an ex-governor. Probabilities 
eliminate no remote possibilities; 
if you flip a coin long enough, 
someday it will stand on edge. 

“How do you figure that?” I 
asked Jones. 

“I don’t want to sound like I 
think I am a brain,” Jones said. 


184 


GALAXY 


“I only read some. But these 
men down here — you might 
say, couldn’t you, that they are 
maybe men who don’t have 
much of a hold on the world 
any more?” 

“True.” 

“And the world holds them 
mighty lightly. They are noth- 
ing. Nobody pays them attention. 
They are outside of everything. 
They are pretty much outside 
the world, even. Now you, Ed — 
you are mostly a part of the 
normal world. But one time you 
were all the way on down here, 
right? So you — ” 

“I have a feeling for it? Some- 
thing like that?” 

“Something like that. And so 
down here you are like the 
others; you can see Stanley. Up- 
town, you couldn’t see him.” 
“Sounds nuts. But how? 
Why?” 

“That goes back, way back. 
Stanley and me, we were kids 
together. Stanley, his people 
were what down there they call 
‘trash.’ Fourteen, fifteen kids. 
Who was whose pa, who would 
know? Or care? And Stanley, he 
was kind of the runt of the whole 
litter. Nobody paid him any 
mind. He never talked much 
’cause nobody listened. Got to 
be a real dopy, dreamy, moody 
kid. Not ever sick, but sickly. He 
was more like nothing than any 
kid I ever did see. 


“Me, I lived down the road a 
piece from Stanley. I don’t know 
why, but he took to following me 
around. Mostly because every- 
one else ran him off, I expect. I 
don’t guess I was real good to 
poor Stanley, but I let him tag 
along. You would hardly know 
he was there; no trouble. And he 
struck me so sort of lost and 
pitiful, you know? I never had 
the heart to chase him. After a 
while, it got to where he even 
took to trailing along after me 
to school. 

“Now that was a funny thing; 
kind of got me to wondering. 
There was a white kid down in 
that part of the country, running 
along after a colored boy to a 
colored school. You would ex- 
pect that to attract a good deal 
of attention, wouldn’t you? 
Maybe stir up a big storm in the 
county. But nobody ever hardly 
seemed to notice Stanley at all. 
There wasn’t anything ever said 
about it. 

“Well, you know, Ed, any kid, 
even Stanley, he wants some at- 
tention, some affection from 
someone. Stanley, all he ever 
had was me and I never more 
than about put up with him 
when we were kids. And any kid 
likes to feel kind of important 
sometime. Be noticed. Be king of 
the hill at recess. Win a spelling 
bee. Whup somebody, or even be 
the kid that gets made to stay 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


185 


after school the most. He wants 
to feel like he is somebody. Only 
Stanley, he never could. Seemed 
like the more he wanted to push 
out into things, the more he 
would get shy and not able to, 
and he would pull away back 
inside even more. He never could 
talk much hardly, even to me. 
Got so I would scarcely know he 
was around myself.” 

44TTE LOST touch with the 
world?” I put in. “Well, 
that happens. There are oddballs 
all over, you know.” 

“Oh, sure — sure there are, 
Ed,” said Jones. “But Stanley 
wasn’t like that, not exactly; or 
only. Seemed like it was as 
much the world lost touch with 
Stanley as it was the other way. 
He always did feel a resentment 
about it, too, and I believe it 
turned him pretty bitter way 
down someplace. ’Course he 
never did say much, but I could 
tell. I got the feeling.” 

“So? How did you come 
here?” 

“Well, my mammy, she passed 
on and there wasn’t anything to 
hold me back there around 
home, so I left. Stanley, he tag- 
ged right along after me. Like a 
shadow. You might say he was 
a sort of a shadow’s shadow, 
huh? We bummed around. I 
worked here and there. Then I 
found out — we found out — 


that most people couldn’t even 
see Stanley at all any more.” 

“He got so far out he was 
really gone?” 

“Only it was kind of pitiful 
the way it made Stanley mad. 
Me, I got vagged a few times. 
Only Stanley, he could be right 
beside me and spit in the 
sheriff’s face and they wouldn’t 
touch him. They wouldn’t even 
know he was there. When I was 
locked up, he could walk in and 
out to visit me. Nobody ever 
stopped him. Nobody saw him 
— except, we found out then, 
that some of the prisoners could 
see Stanley plain enough.” 

“Oh?” I said. 

“Yes. And that’s the way it 
has been. Seems like the only 
people who can see Stanley are 
people like, well, like the ones 
down here around the Yard. The 
ones who are — how would you 
say it? — in the world but not 
of it, huh? I read that some- 
where. People who are far 
enough out can see Stanley; only 
he is farther out than any of 
them.” 

“Hm-m. Well, the world being 
what it is, maybe Stanley is 
lucky.” 

“Ed, you don’t really mean 
that.” 

He was right, of course. This 
world positively was not built 
according to any specifications 
of mine, but still it is my world 


186

and I guess I am pretty fond of 
it at that. Couldn’t ever have 
managed to leave skid row if I 
weren’t. 

“So,” Jones said, “poor Stan- 
ley, he always has been mighty 
dependent on me; more, maybe, 
since we been moving around. 
Until just lately.” 

“Kind of a damn nuisance, 
huh?” 

“It never bothered me too 
much. Of course it keeps me 
down around this part of every 
town we make and maybe this 
isn’t the kind of life I would 
have picked for myself. But 
Stanley has made me feel sort 
of responsible. And some kind of 
responsibility is good for a man, 
wouldn’t you say?” 

I couldn’t argue with it; not 
me. Anyway, it proved what I 
had felt from the start — Wino 
Jones wasn’t a real or a natural 
skid-row type; he was forcing 
himself. 

“Well, Ed, Stanley has been 
trailing me around all the years 
— only somehow I don’t believe 
Stanley ever did really like me 
much. He followed me because 
he couldn’t do anything else, but 
he never took to me. I guess 
maybe I couldn’t ever quite look 
up to him the way he wanted. So 
I suppose he has always been 
looking for something else. Well, 
before we came here, we were 
stopping in a mission one eve- 


ning and I looked around when 
I finished my soup and I couldn’t 
see Stanley. It gave me a turn. 
But after a little while, there he 
was again. I asked him where he 
went. He couldn’t or wouldn’t 
ever tell me much, only that 
there was someplace he was try- 
ing to get to and friends he 
wanted to meet. 

“ ‘I can almost get there,’ 
Stanley told me. ‘There’s the 
border and over there on the 
other side, they want me. I can 
feel they want me. They under- 
stand that I am important to 
them. They want me to come. If 
I could just find the way across 
to — ’ 

“He never told me who it was 
wanted him, or where, or what 
for. But ever since then, every 
once in a while I would look 
around and Stanley would be 
gone. First part of this last week 
he was gone again — and when 
he came back, he was changed. 
He was kind of superior-acting. 
Not pleasant. Wherever he was 
trying to get, he had got there. 
‘Now,’ he told me, ‘I have friends 
who know I am somebody.’ He 
was real set up over it. Tonight 
he went back again.” 

“Where?” I wanted to know. 

J ONES SHOOK his head. “I 
told him, ‘Stanley, we been 
together a long time. You got 
friends besides me, I’m glad 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


187 


Only, you know, I kind of feel 
responsible. Maybe I ought to 
meet your friends, huh? Why 
don’t you take me to meet them?’ 

“ ‘No,’ says Stanley. ‘Oh, no.’ 
He wouldn’t hear of it. I got to 
stay here and wait for him, he 
tells me.” 

“Well, sure,” I told Jones. 
“How could you go with a man 
into his dream?” 

“Yeah — only Stanley did 
take old Mr. Bootnose Bailey 
with him.” 

“What?” I exclaimed. 

“Uh-huh. Stanley said he was 
going to prove it to me. He said 
he would take somebody along 
with him to this place and then 
he would bring one of his friends 
back here to visit. He said that 
would show me, would show 
everybody. And you know, Ed, I 
don’t believe I much liked the 
way poor Stanley looked when 
he said that. He looked kind of 
mean.” 

“But they went? Both of 
them? And that’s why old Boot- 
nose isn’t around?” 

Jones nodded. “Yeah. Stanley 
promised Mr. Bootnose some- 
thing would give him a real boot. 
They went. Stanley, last thing 
he said before I watched the 
two of them just sort of fade out, 
he said he would be back tomor- 
row evening. He wanted me to 
be sure to wait for him in the 
Yard. And fact is, Ed, I’m kind 


of uneasy about it all,” he added. 

There it was, Jonesy’s story. 
A nonsense story? Sure. But it 
left me feeling a little uneasy 
too. We talked it back and forth 
a while longer, Jones and me, 
and the more we talked the more 
uneasy I got. Foolish or not, 
Jones himself believed it. He 
wasn’t trying to con me into 
anything. There was no other 
point to it. And — well, maybe 
it was simply the fact that Jones 
was a good deal of man. What 
he said had a real conviction to 
it. Even if the story was hard to 
believe, still there was what I 
had seen — and not seen — of 
Stanley. And even if there was 
nothing that seemed particularly 
threatening about the business, 
it made the two of us uneasy. 

There was nothing for us to 
do about it, though. I went on 
home to my apartment after I 
promised Jones I would be 
around the next night when 
Stanley, alone or with company, 
was due back. I don’t know what 
Jones expected. I don’t know 
what I expected. But Stanley’s 
friend, no; we didn’t expect that. 

The next day I was filling in 
on the desk, but my mind must 
have been fumbling around with 
Stanley’s other world. I fumbled 
all day and finished by crossing 
up a couple of headlines. So I 
left the office with the managing 
editor’s curses ringing in my 


188 


GALAXY 


ears, even though he had to 
admit that the “Present Stench 
— Future Disaster” line from the 
sewer gas story did fit very 
nicely over the item on the 
mayoralty campaign. 

I was down at the Yard a little 
after five. Jones came along a 
few minutes later. The group 
was there. It always is, except 
when there is a city clean-up. 
Then it moves over behind the 
church. Today there was a ten- 
sion. Jones was smiling, gentle 
and friendly as always, but there 
were nerves back of it. Probably 
the others were mostly just suf- 
fering dry nerves. But I was 
rattled enough so I fumbled a 
five out and put it on the rock. 
That, naturally, meant that 
Coaster Joe and Feeny, who 
moved the quickest, went to 
make a run and didn’t come 
back. With the right change for 
the jug, the wino never skips; 
with change to bring back, al- 
ways. 

\W7ELL, some more silver was 
” painfully dredged up, mostly 
by Jones, and somebody else 
went. The wine went around 
and I admit that this time I took 
a swallow or two on my turn. I 
noticed Jones did too. Not 
much; a little. We were cold 
sober. Too cold, actually. I 
needed the little wine I had in 
me and a lot more. 


That bottle and another went 
around. So did the talk. I was 
leaning on the wall next to 
Jones. Neither of us had much 
to say. Finally, it was just com- 
ing on dusk, I asked him, 
“You’re sure he’ll come here? 
Are you sure he’ll show at all?” 

“He’ll be here. Most any time 
now, Ed. I can feel it. Can’t 
you?” 

I could feel something, but it 
was only a contagion of tension, 
I told myself. 

Then Jones said, “Look there,” 
and pointed. 

I followed the line of his big, 
pink-nailed, black finger off 
along the path through the park 
from Broad Street, a little hazy 
in the summer evening. There 
was nothing. Then there was a 
darker spot in the haze and 
then, not more than about 
twenty feet away, just about to 
pass back of the row of bushes 
along the path, I saw Stanley. 
Tonight he seemed, spmehow, a 
more positive presence, even at 
that distance. There was a cocky 
bounce in his walk and a tilt to 
his chin that announced “Here 
is someone to reckon with.” 
Other eyes in our little circle 
turned his way as he passed be- 
hind the bushes. A couple of 
seconds more and he came 
around the near side and moved 
in to join us. 

“Hello there, Wino,” he said 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


189 



r i* a *4 Tovjet Tii 


to Jones and there was conde- 
scension in it. “Fellows, I want” 

— proudly — “you should meet 
a friend of mine.” 

Around the bushes came a 
shape, a dark shape; Stanley’s 
friend, from some other place or 
world. In our group, Saint Betty, 
a retired queen, choked on the 
jug and handed it to me. I 
shoved it along to Jones. The 
paralyzing effect of Stanley’s 
friend can be measured in the 
fact that the jug went three 
times around that thirsty circle 

— and no one even lifted it to 
his lips till it fell in the dust at 
my feet. 

Stanley’s friend was there all 
right; really there. What did I 
say he was like? A dark shape? 
Yes. But that dark shape and 
the detail of that shape came 
through as clear as a hot blue 
flame to me. 

You weren’t ever down that 
way, right? Not to stay, at least. 
Well, one thing people there 
have in common is the horrors. 
Not just the ordinary day-to-day 
horrors of a hard life but the big 
horrors. The D.T.s. How do they 
go? The detail varies. With 
everyone, there is something that 
really panics him, gives him that 
sense of unreasoning, helpless, 
screaming fear. With a lot of 
people ’ it is snakes. That’s the 
traditional. With others, it can 
be heights, or closed rooms; rats, 


maybe. With me, it has always 
been spiders, ugly, hairy-legged, 
bloat-bellied. 

The horrors. The height man, 
when he gets them, will have the 
sensation of falling, helplessly, 
endlessly. Once I had spiders. 
There were hordes, millions of 
great, stickily scrabbling, poison- 
ous spiders crawling, crawling 
all over me, over everything — 
until I woke wrapped up like an 
iced tamale in the cold wet sheet 
that is called “calming restraint” 
in psycho wards. 

Stanley’s friend? Well, it’s an 
ugly thought, but consider those 
spiders of mine. And consider 
people. People, mostly, have re- 
ligion. “God made man in his 
image,” they say, except God, of 
course, is the infinitely greater. 
Now suppose that spiders had a 
god. A spider god. “God made 
spiders in his image,” the spiders 
might say, right? So such a 
spider god, that almighty apoth- 
eosis of spiderdom — that was 
Stanley’s friend as I saw him. 

T DON’T KNOW how I could 

see a thing like that. Maybe 
I didn’t see it, exactly. But ab- 
solutely, in some way, by what- 
ever means, the positive percep- 
tion of such a thing burned itself 
into my eyes and mind. 

The other fellows? No one 
screamed aloud, although my 
mind was screaming. Horrors 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE

were not less horrible to us, only 
less unfamiliar than to other 
people. One by one, the others 
quivered to shaky feet and they 
stumbled off through the eve- 
ning. The jug, three-quarters 
full yet, stayed there in the dust 
of the Yard, forgotten. 

How long it was, I don’t know. 
Not long — and then only Jones 
and I were left with Stanley and 
Stanley’s friend. The rest of the 
park was empty. Across Bug 
Alley in front of the church an 
old woman carrying a sack of 
rubbish was impelled to look our 
way. She screeched in a high, 
disappearing pitch and crumpled 
to the walk. The church was 
dark and silent. 

Jones stood there, big, power- 
ful, leaning against the wall. He 
smiled at Stanley, but it was a 
weak, sick smile. How he man- 
aged that much, I’ll never know. 
Weak, trembling, stomach churn- 
ing, I dragged myself up. 

“Uh — well,” I mumbled, 
“f’you fellows will excuse me — 
guess I better be moving along.” 

Stanley’s lip curled. He was 
irritated. I couldn’t help that. 

“You see?” It wasn’t speech, 
but the thought came plainly 
from Stanley’s friend, out of a 
churning of black, hungry 
thoughts, “You see how it is? 
Even now, not even such as 
these will welcome us as friends 
and equals.” 


“Yes,” snapped Stanley, “I 
see. I should have known. All 
right then, we’ll do it your way. 
We will show them all.” 

I stumbled a step or two 
toward the path. 

“Wino,” said Stanley, “Wino 
Jones. We are going over to the 
other side now. But we will be 
back, you hear me? You just 
wait.” 

“Sure, Stanley,” said Jones, still 
gentle, kind. “Only, Stanley, are 
you sure?” 

“I’m sure,” said Stanley. He 
turned to his friend. “Come on. 
Let’s go.” 

They moved together toward 
the bushes. 

Stanley looked back over his 
shoulder at Jones. “We’ll be 
back,” he said, “we’ll be back, 
Wino. You be looking for us.” 

Then they were gone. Thank 
the good Lord, they were gone. 

“Well,” I quavered at Jones, 
“you did say you were kind of 
uneasy about him, didn’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Jones, “that’s right. 
You going on home now, Ed?” 

“You bet!” 

“I don’t like to impose, but 
would you mind if I kind of 
tagged along? I don’t feel too 
good — after that thing with 
Stanley, built of all those thou- 
sands of hissing, wiggling 
snakes.” 

With Jones, it had been 
snakes, not spiders. The others

— to each his own? Somehow 
that • made it seem even worse. 
Jones wanted to come along 
with me? I was glad and grate- 
ful. I don’t know that I could 
have stood being alone that 
night. 

¥ TP IN MY apartment, we 
^ turned on all the lights. Had 
a couple of nightcaps. Sat up all 
night in my luxurious eight-by- 
ten living-dining-kitchen area for 
modern living. We talked a little, 
but not about Stanley and his 
friend. It was too fresh and we 
were too shaken. It seemed safer 
not to mention it. 

I suppose we must have dozed 
off and on. In the morning, I 
woke up. I still had the shakes. 
No hangover, but the shakes. 

“Jonesy,” I said. “Jonesy, I 
guess maybe I ought to be get- 
ting along to work. What are 
you going to do?” 

He woke up, full awake, like 
that. “I’m not going back,” he 
said. “You know?” 

“Yeah.” 

“I got a feeling. I got kind of 
a feeling that maybe I am sort 
of Stanley’s doorway or gate 
back here, if you know what I 
mean. He was always nearer to 
me than anyone. You notice he 
kept telling me to wait for him? 

> I think maybe he needs to feel 
around and find me to make his 
way back across from wherever 


he went. So, if I’m not there, if 
he can’t locate me, could be he 
won’t be able to make his way 
back — with his friends. I think 
I better stay as far away from 
down there as I can get. You 
reckon there might be some kind 
of job I could do on that paper 
you work for?” 

“Sure,” I said. I knew they 
needed some men in the circula- 
tion department. “That isn’t so 
very far away, though, is it?” I 
had a sense that he was right 
about Stanley. 

“Not miles. Distance, like that, 
I don’t think it makes much 
difference where Stanley is. It’s 
the Yard and all that, huh? 
Seems to be like if I get a steady 
job, get to be a real, steady, 
normal citizen, that’s what would 
make me hard for Stanley to 
find.” 

“Yes,” I said, “I see. The more 
you are a full part of this world, 
the farther away you will be 
from that other one — and 
Stanley.” 

“That’s it.” 

“I hope so. Lord, I hope so. 
You come along down with me 
this morning. We’ll get you a job 
if we have to kill someone to 
make a vacancy . Jonesy, that 
— that thing, spiders, snakes — 
you are sure it was real? It was 
actually here, I mean? And 
might come back if Stanley can 
make the way — in force?” 


THE LITTLE MAN WHO WASN'T QUITE 


193 


“Yes, Ed. You didn’t really 
have to ask, did you?” 

“No,” I said. 

And that’s it and that’s all., 

CINCE THEN — well, Jones 
^ is working for the paper. He 
got to be assistant circulation 
manager in less than a year. He 
is as respectable and non-skid- 
row a citizen as there is in town. 
Has a girl; getting married next 
month. 

Me? I’m the same, maybe a 
little better. I go every other 
week to visit my kids and Jennie, 
my ex, has taken to staying 
around now. We even talk a 
little bit and, last time, I took 
her some flowers and she 
blushed like a bride. Something 


might even come of it — given 
enough time. 

I have checked back on the 
Yard a few times but so far, at 
least, nothing more than the 
standard rack-up of ordinary 
horrors. I am not going to check 
any more. What for? Such a 
thing as Stanley’s friend, you 
couldn’t fight, and I wouldn’t 
know what direction to run. If 
those things ever find a way over 
here, where would they be com- 
ing from? I don’t know. From 
inside, maybe, Jones says. How 
do you run from that? 

Best, I think, forget it. I in- 
tend to try. And, so help me, I 
am through with skid row. Who 
wouldn’t be?

FORECAST 

We begin the new year for Galaxy with the end of an old tradition. 
The first time the Frederik Pohl-C.M. Kornbluth byline appeared it was in 
Galaxy, on the famous Gravy Planet (which as The Space Merchants has 
been republished in one form or another every year since, somewhere in 
the world — this year in Brazil, Japan and Czechoslovakia.) The last time 
will be in our next issue, with a complete novella called Critical Mass. Since 
Kornbluth's untimely death a few years ago, Pohl has completed several 
projects then unfinished; this is the last of them. 

Naturally we'll also have Poul Anderson, completing his The Day 
After Doomsday which begins so brilliantly this month. There will be at 
least one novelette, shorts to fit . and another item worth mentioning. 
It is called The Martian Star-Gazers — not a story but an article — and it 
will be the subject of our February cover.
