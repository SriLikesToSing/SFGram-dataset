THIS DREAM WE HAVE... 



F antasize along with us for a mo- 
ment. The Chairman wakes up 
to a phone call, the four hundredth 
in a matter of weeks, with yet 
another complaint that the collec- 
lective farms just aren’t producing 
enough food; the natives are rest- 
less, and putting another locomotive 
into orbit is not going to cheer them 
up any more. 

Gloomily the Chairman sits on 
the edge of his bed fondling his shoe. 
He reasons that while the Western 
world is falling into decay, it seems 
to be taking forever to do it and 
in the meantime, most everyone 
seems to have enough to eat. So in 
the West they have something that 
really works, and it’s not just seed- 
corn. 

So the Chairman suddenly says 
(in Cyrillic characters), “Well, hell!” 
and reaches for the phone. And from 
this point on, the world is amazed 
to learn that the collectives have 
been dissolved and the land given to 
the peasants, to work for their own 
profit. 

Before you can say borscht, the 
cabbages start rolling in and there’s 
babka for everyone. But about this 
time the typographers and the fur- 
niture-makers and the little old po- 
tatoface in the vodka mill all get a 
look at file fins on the cars the far- 

8 



mers are driving, and they set up a 
howl envied by all the banshees in 
Ireland, until by Michaelmas, the 
whole country turns capitalistic. Got 
it? 

Now ask yourself this question. 
If the Soviet Union ovemi^t went 
capitalist, do you think there would 
be any easing of international ten- 
sions? 

If the answer is yes, everything’s 
jolly. If the answer is no, then there 
seems to be an aching vacuum in 
the general thinking. Because com- 
munism is supposed to be the 
Enemy and the defeat of commu- 
nism the goal. We even seem to be 
making some progress in that dir- 
rection in many ways. But nobody 
seems to be telling us what we’re 
supposed to do if we achieve total 
victory over communism and still 
find that we have to live under the 
shadow of the Big Boom. 

We suppose that it is necessary 
(although it is irritating to feel that 
it is necessary) to say here that 
totalitarian communism is bad stuff, 
and we want no part of it. The only 
thing is, people keep calling it the 
Enemy as if it was the Only Enemy, 
and we keep having this fantasy.

THE 

TIME-TOMB 




BY J. G. BALLARD 



The ancient Martians were 
long dead — but the legacy 
they left would never die! 



I 

U sually in the evenings, while 
Traxel and Bridges drove oft in- 
to the sand-sea, Shepley and the Old 
Man would wander among the 
gutted time-tombs, listening to them 
splutter faintly in the dying light as 
they recreated their fading personas, 

6 



the deep crystal vaults flaring briefly 
like giant goblets. 

Most of the time-tombs on the 
southern edge of the sand-sea had 
been stripped centuries earlier. But 
Shepley liked to saunter through the 
straggle of half-submerged pavilions, 
the warm ancient sand playing over 
his bare feet like wavelets on some 



IF 





endless beach. Alone among the 
flickering tombs, with the empty 
husks of the past ten thousand years, 
he could temporarily forget his nag- 
ging sense of failure. 

Tonight, however, he would have 
to forego the walk. Traxel who was 
nominally the leader of the group of 
tomb-robbers, had pointedly warned 
him at dinner that he must pay his 
way or leave. For three weeks Shep- 
ley had put off going with Traxel 
and Bridges, making a series of pro- 
gressively lamer excuses, and they 
had begun to get impatient with him. 
The Old Man they would tolerate, 
for his vast knowledge of the sand- 
sea — he had combed the decaying 
tombs for over forty years and knew 
every reef and therm-pool like the 
palm of his hand — and because he 
was an institution that somehow dig- 
nified the lowly calling of tomb- 
robber, but Shepley had been there 
for only three months and had noth- 
ing to offer except his morose si- 
lences and self-hate. 

“Tonight, Shepley,” Traxel told 
him firmly in his hard clipped voice, 
“you must find a tape. We cannot 
support you indefinitely. Remember, 
we’re all as eager to leave Vergil as 
you are.” 

Shepley nodded, watching his re- 
flection in the gold finger-bowl. Trax- 
el sat at the head of the tilting table, 
his high-collared velvet jacket un- 
buttoned. Surrounded by the batter- 
ed gold plate filched from the tombs, 
red wine spilling across the table 
from Bridges* tankard, he looked 
mode like a Renaissance princeling 



than a cashiered Ph.D. from Tycho 
U. Once Traxel had ^cen Professor 
of Semantics, and Shepley wondered 
what scandal had brought him to 
Vergil. Now, like a grave-rat, he 
hunted the time-tombs with Bridges, 
selling the tapes to the Psycho- 
History Museums at a dollar a foot. 
Shepley found it impossible to come 
to terms with the tall, aloof man. By 
contrast Bridges, who was just a 
thug, had a streak of blunt good 
humor that made him tolerable, but 
with Traxel he could never relax. 
Perhaps his cold laconic manner re- 
presented authority, the high-faced, 
stem-eyed interrogators who still 
pursued Shepley in his dreams. 

Bridges kicked back his chair and 
lurched away around the table, 
pounding Shepley across the shoul- 
ders. 

“You come with us, kid. Tonight 
we’ll find a mega-tape.” 

O utside, the low-hulled, camou- 
flaged halftrack waited in a sad- 
dle between two dunes. The old sum- 
mer palace was sinking slowly below 
the desert, and the floor of the ban- 
queting hall shelved into the white 
sand like the deck of a subsiding 
liner, going down with lights blazing 
from its staterooms. 

“What about you. Doctor?” Traxel 
asked the Old Man as Bridges swung 
aboard the half-track and the ex- 
haust kicked out. “It would be a 
pleasure to have you along.” When 
the Old Man shook his head Traxel 
turned to Shepley. “Well, are you 
coming?” 



8 



IP 




“Not tonight,” Shcpiey demurred 
hurriedly. “I’ll, er, walk down to the 
tomb-beds latCT myself.” 

‘Twenty miles?” Traxel reminded 
him, watching reflectively. “Very 
well.” He zipped up his jacket and 
strode away towards the half-track. 
As they moved off he shouted: 
“Shepley, I meant what I said!” 
Shepley watched them disappear 
among the dunes. Flatly, he repeat- 
ed: “He means what he says.” 

The Old Man shrugged, sweeping 
some sand off the table. “Traxel. 
he’s a difficult man. What are you 
going to do?” The note of reproach 
in his voice was mild, realizing that 
Shepley’s motives were the same as 
those which had marooned himself 
on the lost beaches of the sand-sea 
four decades earlier. 

Shepley snapped irritably. “I can’t 
go with him. After five minutes he 
drains me like a skull. What’s the 
matter with Traxel, why is he here?” 
The Old Man stood up, staring 
out vaguely into the desert. “I can’t 
remember. Everyone has his own 
reasons. After a while the stories 
overlap.” 

They walked out under the pro- 
scenium, following the grooves left 
by the half-track. A mile away, wind- 
ing between the last of the lava- 
lakes which marked the southern 
shore of the sand-sea, they could just 
see the vehicle vanishing into the 
darkness. The old tomb-beds, where 
Shepley and the Old Man usually 
walked, lay between them, the pa- 
vilions arranged in three lines along 
a low basaltic ridge. Occasionally a 



brief flare of li^t flickered up into 
the white, bone-like darkness, but 
most of the tombs were silent. 

Shepley stopped, hands falling 
limply to his sides. “The new beds 
are by the Lake of Newton, nearly 
twenty miles away. I can’t follow 
them.” 

“I shouldn’t try,” the Old Man 
rejoined. “There wak a big sand- 
storm last night. The time-wardens 
will be out in force marking any 
new tombs uncovered.” He chuck- 
led softly to himself. “Traxel and 
Bridges won’t find a foot of tape 
— they’ll be lucky if they’re not ar- 
rested.” He took off his white cot- 
ton hat and squinted shrewdly 
through the dead light, assessing the 
altered contours of the dunes, then 
guided Shepley towards the old 
mono-rail whose southern terminus 
ended by the tomb-beds. Once it had 
been used to transport the pavilions 
from the station on the northern 
shore of the sand-sea^ and a small 
gyro-car stiU leaned igainst the 
freight platform. “We’ll go over to 
Pascal. Something may have come 
up, you never know.” 

S hepley shook his head. *Traxd 
took me there when I first ar- 
rived. They’ve all been stripped a 
hundred times.” 

“WeU, we’U have a look.” The 
Old Man plodded on towards the 
mono-rail, his dirty white suit flap- 
ping in the low breeze. Behind them 
the summer palace — built three cen- 
turies earlier by a business tycoon 
from Ceres — ^faded into the dark- 



THE T1A\E TOMBS 



t 




ness, the rippling glass tiles in the 
upper spires merging into the star- 
light. 

Propping the car against the plat- 
form, Shepley wound up the gyro- 
scope, then helped the Old Man onto 
the front seat. He pried off a piece 
of rusting platform rail and began 
to punt the car away. Every fifty 
yards or so they stopped to clear 
the sand that submerged the track, 
but slowly they wound off among 
the dunes and lakes, here and there 
the onion-shaped cupola of a solitary 
time-tomb rearing up into the sky 
beside them, fragments of the crys- 
tal casements twinkling in the sand 
like minuscule stars. 

Half an hour later, as they rode 
down the final long incline towards 
the Lake of Pascal, Shepley went 
forward to sit beside the Old Man, 
who emerged from his private rev- 
erie to ask quizzically: ‘‘And you, 
Shepley, why are you here?” 

Shepley leaned back, letting the 
cool air drain the sweat off his face. 
“Once I tried to kill someone,” he 
explained tersely. “After they cured 
me I found I wanted to kill myself 
instead.” He reached down to the 
hand-brake as they gathered speed. 
“For ten thousand dollars I can go 
back on probation. Here T thought 
there would be a freemasonry of 
sorts. But then you’ve been kind 
enough, Doctor.” 

“Don’t worry, we’ll get you a win- 
ning tape.” He leaned forward, 
shielding his eyes from the stellar 
glare, gazing down at the little can- 
tonment of gutted time-tombs on the 

10 



shore of the lake. In all there were 
about a dozen pavilions, their roofs 
holed, the group Traxel had shown 
to Shepley after his arrival when he 
demonstrated how the vaults were 
robbed. 

“Shepley! Look, lad!” 

“Where? I’ve seen them before, 
Doctor. They’re stripped.” 

The Old Man pushed hini away. 
“No, you fool, about three hundred 
yards to the west, in the shadow of 
the long ridge where the big dunes 
have moved. Can you see them 
now?” He drummed a white fist on 
Shepley’s knee. “You’ve made it, lad. 
You won’t need to be frightened of 
Traxel or anyone else now.” 

Shepley jerked the car to a halt. 
As he ran ahead of the Old Man to- 
wards the escarpment he could see 
several of the time-tombs glowing 
along the sky-line, emerging briefly 
from the dark earth like the tents of 
some spectral caravan. 

U 

F or ten millenia the Sea of Ver- 
gil had served as a burial ground, 
and the 1 ,500 square miles of restless 
sand were estimated to contain over 
twenty thousand tombs. All but a 
minute fraction had been stripped 
by the successive generations of 
tomb robbers, and an intact spool 
of the 17th Dynasty could now be 
sold to the Psycho-History Museum 
at Tycho for over 3,000 dollars. For 
each preceding dynasty, though none 
older than the 12th had ever been 
found, there was a bonus. 



IP 




There were no corpses in the time- 
tombs, no dusty skeletons. The 
cyber-architectonic ghosts which 
haunted them were embalmed in the 
metallic codes of memory tapes, 
three-dimensional molecular tran- 
scriptions of their living originals, 
stored among the dunes as a stupen- 
dous act of faith, in the hope that 
one day the physical re-creation of 
the coded personalities would be 
possible. After five thousand years 
the attempt had been reluctantly 
abandoned, but out of respect for 
the tomb-builders their pavilions 
were left to take their own hazard 
with time in the Sea of Vergil. Later 
the tomb-robbers had arrived, as the 
historians of the new epochs real- 
ized the enormous archives that lay 
waiting for them in this antique lim- 
bo. Despite the time-wardens, the 
pillaging of the tombs and the illicit 
traffic in dead souls continued. 

44T^octor! Come on! Look at 
them!” 

Shepley plunged wildly up to his 
knees in the silver-white sand, diving 
from one pavilion to the next like a 
frantic puppy. 

Smiling to himself, the Old Man 
climbed slowfy up the melting slope, 
submerged to his waist as the fine 
crystals poured away around him, 
feeling for spurs of firmer rock. The 
cupola of the nearest tomb tilted in- 
to the sky, only the top six inches of 
the casements visible below the over- 
hang. He sat for a moment on the 
roof, watching Shepley dive about 
in the darkness, then peered through 



the casement, brushing away the 
sand with his hands. 

The tomb was intact. Inside he 
could see the votive light burning 
over the altar, the hexagonal nave 
with its inlaid gold floor and dra- 
pery, the narrow chancel at the rear 
which held the memory store. Lbw 
tables surrounded the chancel, car- 
rying beaten goblets and gold bowls, 
token offerings intended to distract 
any pillager who stumbled upon the 
tomb. 

Shepley came leaping over to him. 
“Let’s get into them, Doctor! What 
are we waiting for?” 

The Old Man looked out over the 
plain below, at the cluster of stripped 
tombs by the edge of the lake, at 
the dark ribbon of the gyro-rail 
winding away among the hills. The 
thought of the fortune that lay at 
his finger tips left him unmoved. For 
so long now he had lived among the 
tombs that he had begun to assume 
something of their ambience of im- 
mortality and timelessness, and Shep- 
ley’s impatience seemed to come out 
of another dimension. He hated 
stripping the tombs. Each one 
robbed represented, not just the final 
extinction of a surviving personality, 
but a diminution of his own sense of 
eternity. Whenever a new tomb-bed 
emerged from the sand he felt some- 
thing within himself momentarily re- 
kindled, not hope, for he was be- 
yond that, but a serene acceptance 
of the brief span of time left to him. 

“Right,” he nodded. They began 
to cleave away the sand piled around 
the door, Shepley driving it down 



THE TIME TOMBS 



11 




the slope where it spilled in a white 
foam over the darker basaltic chips. 
When the narrow portico was free 
the Old Man squatted by the time- 
seal. His fingers cleaned away the 
crystals embedded between the tabs, 
then played lightly over them. 

Like dry sticks breaking, an an- 
cient voice crackled: 

Orion, Betelgeuse, Altair, 

What twice-born star shall be my 
heir, 

Doomed again to be the scion — 

“Come on, Doctor, this is a quick- 
er way.” Shepley put one leg up 
against the door and lunged against 
it futilely. The Old Man pushed him 
away. With his mouth close to the 
seal, he rejoined: 

Of Altair, Betelgeuse, Orion, 

As the doors accepted this and 
swung back he murmured: “Don’t 
despise the old rituals. Now, let’s 
see.” They paused in the cool, un- 
breathed air, the votive light throw- 
ing a pale ruby glow over the gold 
drapes parting across the chancel. 

T ^he air became curiously hazy 
and mottled. Within a few sec- 
onds it began to vibrate with in- 
creasing rapidity, and a succession of 
vivid colors rippled across the sur- 
face of what appeared to be a cone 
of light projected from the rear of 
the chancel. Soon this resolved itself 
into a three-dimensional image of an 
elderly man in a blue robe. 



Although the image was transpar- 
ent, the brilliant electric blue of the 
robe revealing the inadequacies of 
the projection system, the intensity 
of the illusion was such that Shepley 
almost expected the man to speak 
to them. He was well into his seven- 
ties, with a composed, watchful face 
and thin gray hair, his hands resting 
quietly in front of him. The edge of 
the desk was just visible, the prox- 
imal arc of the cone enclosing part 
of a silver ink-stand and a small 
metal trophy. These details, and the 
spectral bookshelves and paintings 
which formed the backdrop of the 
illusion, were of infinite value to the 
Psycho-History institutes, providing 
evidence of the earlier civilizations 
far more reliable then the funerary 
urns and goblets in the anteroom. 

Shepley began to move forward, 
the definition of the persona fading 
slightly. A visual relay of the mem- 
ory store, it would continue to play 
after the code had been removed, 
though the induction coils would 
soon exhaust themselves. Then the 
tomb would be finally extinct. 

Two feet away, the wise unblink- 
ing eyes of the long dead magnate 
stared at him steadily, his seamed 
forehead like a piece of pink trans- 
parent wax. Tentatively, Shepley 
reached out and plunged his hand 
into the cone, the myriad vibration 
patterns racing across his wrist. For 
a moment he held the dead man’s 
face in his hand, the edge of the 
desk and the silver inkstand dappling 
across his sleeve. 

Then he stepped forward and 

ir 



12 




walked straight through him into the 
darkness at the rear of the chancel. 

Quickly, following Traxel’s in- 
structions, he unbolted the console 
containing the memory store, lifting 
out the three heavy drums which 
held the tape spools. Immediately 
the persona began to dim, the edge 
of the desk and the bookshelves van- 
ishing as the cone contracted. Nar- 
row bands of dead air appeared 
across it, one, at the level of the 
man’s neck, decapitating him. Lower 
down the scanner had begun to mis- 
fire. The folded hands trembled 
nervously, and now and then one of 
his shoulders gave a slight twitch. 
Shepley stepped through him without 
looking back. 

The Old Man was waiting outside. 
Shepley dropped the drums onto the 
sand. ‘They’re heavy,” he muttered. 
Brightening, he added: “There must 
be over five hundred feet here. Doc- 
tor. With the bonus, and all the 
others as well — ” He took the Old 
Man’s arm. “Come on, let’s get into 
the next one.” 

The Old Man disengaged himself, 
watching the sputtering persona in 
die pavilion, the blue light from the 
dead man’^ suit pulsing across the 
sand like a soundless lightning storm. 

“Wait a minute, lad, don’t run 
away with yourself.” As Shepley be- 
gan to slide off through the sand, 
sending further falls down the slope, 
he added in a firmer voice: “And 
stop moving all that sand around! 
These tombs have been hidden here 
for ten thousand years. Don’t undo 
all the good work, or the wardens 



will be finding them the first time 
they go past.” 

“Or Traxel,” Shepley said, sober- 
ing quickly. He glanced around the 
lake below, searching the shadows 
among the tombs in case anyone 
was watching them, waiting to seize 
the treasure. 

Ill 

T he Old Man left him at the 
door of the next pavilion, reluc- 
tant to watch the tomb being 
stripped of the last vestige of its al- 
ready meager claim to immortality. 

“This will be our last one tonight,” 
he told Shepley. “You’ll never hide 
all these tapes from Bridges and 
Traxel.” 

The furnishings of the tomb dif- 
fered from the previous one’s. Som- 
ber black marble panels covered the 
walls, inscribed with strange gold- 
leaf hieroglyphs, and the inlays in 
the floor represented stylized astro- 
logical symbols, at once eerie and 
obscure. Shepley leaned against the 
altar, watching the cone of light 
reach out towards him from the 
chancel as the curtains parted. The 
predominant colors were gold and 
carmine, mingled with a vivid pow- 
dery copper that gradually resolved 
itself into the huge, harp-like head- 
dress of a reclining woman. She lay 
in the center of what seemed to be 
a sphere of softly luminous gas, in- 
clined against a massive black cata- 
falque, from the sides of which flared 
two enormous heraldic wings. The 
woman’s copper hair was swept 



THE TIME TOMBS 



IS 




straight back off her forehead, some 
five or si^ feet long, and merged 
with the plumage of the wings, giving 
her an impression of tremendous 
contained speed, like a goddess ar- 
rested in a moment of flight in a 
cornice of some great temple-city of 
the dead. 

Her eyes stared forward expres- 
sionlessly at Shepley. Her arms and 
shoulders were bare, and the white 
skin, like compacted snow, had a 
brilliant surface sheen, the reflected 
light glaring against the black base of 
the catafalque and the long sheath- 
like gown that swept around her hips 
to the floor. Her face, like an ex- 
quisite porcelain mask, was tilted up- 
ward slightly, the hooded, half- 
closed eyes suggesting that the wom- 
an was asleep or dreaming. No back- 
ground had been provided for the 
image, but the bowl of luminescence 
invested the whole persona with im- 
mense power and mystery. 

Shepley hea<*d the Old Man shuffle 
up behind him 

“Who is she, Doctor? A princess?'’ 

The Old Man shook his head sIdw- 
ly. “You car only guess. 1 don’t 
know. There are strange treasures 
in these tombs Get on with it, we'd 
best be going ” 

Shepley hesitated. He started to 
walk towards the woman on the cata- 
falque,* and then felt the enormous 
upward surge of her flight, the pres- 
sure of all the past centuries carried 
before her brought to a sudden focus 
in front of him, holding him back 
like a physical barrier. 

“Doctor!” He reached the door 



just behind the Old Man. “We’ll 
leave this one, there’s no hurry!” 
The Old Man examined his face 
shrewdly in the moonlight, the bril- 
liant colors of the persona flickering 
across Shepley’s youthful cheeks. “I 
know how you feel, lad, but remem- 
ber, the woman doesn’t exist, any 
more than a painting. You’ll have to 
come back for her soon.” 

Shepley nodded quickly. “I know, 
but some other night. There’s some- 
thing uncanny about this tomb.” He 
closed the doors behind them, and 
immediately the huge cone of light 
shrank back into the chancel, suck- 
ing the woman and the catafalque 
into the darkness. The wind swept 
across the dunes, throwing a fine 
spray of sand onto the half-buried 
cupolas, sighing among the wrecked 
tombs. 

The Old Man made his way down 
to the mono-rail, and waited for 
Shepley as he worked for the next 
hour, slowly covering each of the 
tombs. 

O n the Old Man’s recommenda- 
tion he gave Traxel only one of 
the canisters, containing about 500 
feet of tape. As prophesied, the time- 
wardens had been out in force in 
the Sea of Newton, and two mem- 
bers of another gang had been 
caught red-handed. Bridges was in 
foul temper, but Traxel, as ever self- 
contained, seemed unworried at the 
wasted evening. 

Straddling the desk in the tilting 
ballroom, he examined the drum 
with interest, complimenting Shepley

on his initiative. “Excellent, Shepley. 
I’m glad you joined us now. Do you 
mind telling me where you found 
thisr 

Shepley shrugged vaguely, began 
to mumble something about a secret 
basement in one of the gutted tombs 
nearby, but the Old Man cut in: 
“Don’t broadcast it everywhere! 
Traxel, you shouldn’t ask questions 
like that — he’s got his own living 
to earn.” 

Traxel smiled, sphinx-like. “Right 
again, Doctor.” He tapped the 
smooth untarnished case. “In mint 
condition, and a 15th Dynasty too.” 

“Tenth!” Shepley claimed indig- 
nantly, frightened that Traxel might 
try to pocket the bonus. The Old 
Man cursed, and Traxel’s eyes 
gleamed. 

“Tenth, is it? I didn’t realize there 
were any 10th Dynasty tombs still 
intact. You surprise me, Shepley. Ob- 
viously you have concealed talents.” 

Luckily he seemed to assume that 
the Old Man had been hoarding the 
tape for years. 

Face down in a shallow hollow at 
the edge of the ridge, Shepley 
watched the white-hulled sand-car of 
the time-wardens shunt through the 
darkness by the old cantonment. Di- 
rectly below him jutted the spires of 
the newly discovered tomb-bed, in- 
visible against the dark background 
of the ridge. The two wardens in the 
sand-car were more interested in the 
old tombs; they had spotted the gyro- 
car lying on its side by the mono- 
raO, and guessed that the gangs had 



been working the ruins over again. 
One of them stood on the running 
board, flicking a torch into the 
gutted pavilions. Crossing the mono- 
rail, the car moved off slowly across 
the lake to the northwest, a low paB 
of dust settling behind it. 

For a few moments Shepley lay 
quietly in the slack darkness, watch- 
ing the gullies and ravines that led 
into the lake, then slid down among 
the pavilions. Brushing away the 
sand to reveal a square wooden 
plank, he slipped below it into the 
portico. 

As the golden image of the en- 
chantress loomed out of the black- 
walled chancel to greet him, the 
great reptilian wings unfurling 
around her, he stood behind one of 
the columns in the nave, fascinated 
by her strange deathless beauty. At 
times her vivid luminous face 
seemed almost repellent, but he had 
nonetheless seized on the faint pos- 
sibility of her resurrection. Each 
night he came, stealing into the tomb 
where she had lain for ten thousand 
years, unable to bring himself to in- 
terrupt her. The long copper hair 
streamed behind her like an en- 
trained time-wind, her angled body 
in flight between two infinitely dis- 
tant universes, where archetypal be- 
ings of superhuman stature glimmer- 
ed fitfully in their own spontaneous- 
ly generated light. 

T ^wo days later Bridges discov- 
ered the remainder of the drums. 
‘Traxel! Traxel!” he bellowed, rac- 
ing across the inner courtyard from 



U 



IF 




the entrance to one of the disused 
bunkers. He bounded into the ball- 
room and slammed the metal cans 
onto the computer which Traxel was 
programming. “Take a look at these 
— more Tenths! The whole place is 
crawling with them!” 

Traxel weighed the cans idly in 
his hands, glancing across at Shepley 
and the Old Man, on lookout duty 
by the window. “Interesting. Where 
did you find them?” 

Shepley jumped down from the 
window trestle. “They’re mine. The 
Doctor will confirm it. They run in 
sequence after the first I gave you a 
week ago. I was storing them.” 
Bridges cut back with an oath. 
“Whaddya mean, storing them? Is 
that your personal bunker out there? 
Since when?” He shoved Shepley 
away with a broad hand and swung 
round on Traxel. “Listen, Traxel, 
those tapes were a fair find, I don’t 
see any tags on them. Every time I 
bring something in I’m going to have 
this kid claim it?” 

Traxel stood up, adjusting his 
height so that he over-reached 
Bridges. “Of course, you’re right — 
technically. But we have to work to- 
gether, dqn’t we? Shepley made a 
mistake, we’ll forgive him this time.” 
He handed the drums to Shepley, 
Bridges seething with barely controll- 
ed indignation. “If I were you, Shep- 
ley, I’d get those cashed. Don’t worry 
about flooding the market.” As 
Shepley turned away, sidestepping 
Bridges, he called him back. “And 
there are advantages in working to- 
gether. you know.” 



He watched Shepley disappear to 
his room, then turned to survey the 
huge peeling map of the sand-sea 
that covered the facing wall. 

“You’ll have to strip the tombs 
now,” the Old Man told Shepley 
later. “It’s obvious you’ve stumbled 
on something, and it won’t ^ take 
Traxel five minutes to discover 
where.” 

“Perhaps a little longer,” Shepley 
replied evenly. They stepped out of 
the shadow of the palace and moved 
away among the dunes; Bridges and 
Traxel were watching them from the 
dining room table, their figures mo- 
tionless in the light. “The roofs are 
almost completely covered now. The 
next sandstorm should bury them 
for good.” 

“Have you entered any of the oth- 
er tombs?” 

Shepley shook his head vigorously. 
“Believe me. Doctor, I know now 
why the timewardens are here. As 
long as there’s a chance of their be 
ing resurrected we’re committing 
murder every time we rob a tomb. 
Even if it’s only one chance in a mil- 
lion it may be all they themselves 
bargained on. After all, one doesn’t 
commit suicide because the chances 
of life existing anywhere are virtual- 
ly nil.” 

Already he had come to believe 
that the enchantress might suddenly 
resurrect herself, step down from 
the catafalque before his eyes. While 
a slender possibility existed of her 
returning to life he felt that he too 
had a valid foothold in existence, 
that there was a small element of 



THE TIME TOMBS 



IF 




certainty in what had previously 
seemed a random and utterly mean 
ingless universe. 

IV 

A s the first dawn light probed 
through the casements, Shepley 
turned reluctantly from the nave. 
He looked back briefly at the glow 
ing persona, suppressing the slight 
pang of disappointment that the ex- 
pected metamorphosis had not yet 
occurred, but relieved to have spent 
as much time awaiting it as possible. 

He made his way down to the old 
cantonment, steering carefully 
through the shadows. As he reached 
the monorail — he now made the 
journey on foot, to prevent Traxel 
guessing that the cache lay along the 
route of the rail — he heard the 
track hum faintly in the cool air. He 
jumped back behind a low mound, 
tracing its winding pathway through 
the dunes. 

Suddenly an engine throbbed out 
behind him, and Traxel’s camou- 
flaged halftrack appeared over the 
edge of the ridge. Its front four 
wheels raced and spun, and the huge 
vehicle tipped forward and plunged 
down the incline among the buried 
tombs, its surging tracks dislodging 
tons of the fine sand Shepley had so 
laboriously pushed by hand up the 
slope. Immediately several of the 
pavilions appeared to view, the white 
dust cascading off their cupolas. 

Half-buried in the avalanche they 
had set off, Traxel and Bridges leapt 
from the driving cab, pointing to the 



pavilions and shouting at each other. 
Shepley darted forward, put his foot 
up on the mono-rail just as it began 
to vibrate loudly. 

In the distance the gyro-car slow- 
ly approached, the Old Man punting 
it along, hatless and disheveled. 

He reached the tomb as Bridges 
was kicking the door in with a heavy 
boot, Traxel behind him with a bag 
full of wrenches. 

“Hello, Shepley!” Traxel greeted 
him gaily. “So this is your treasure 
trove.” 

Shepley staggered splay-legged 
through the sliding sand, brushed 
past Traxel as glass spattered from 
the window. He flung himself on 
Bridges and pulled the big man back- 
wards. 

“Bridges, this one’s mine! Try any 
of the others, you can have them 
all!” 

Bridges jerked himself to his feet, 
staring down angrily at Shepley. 
Traxel peered suspiciously at the oth- 
er tombs, their porticos still flooded 
with sand. “What’s so interesting 
about this one, Shepley?” he asked 
sardonically. Bridges roared and 
slammed a boot into the casement, 
knocking out one of the panels. 
Shepley dived onto his shoulders, 
and Bridges snarled and flung him 
against the wall. Before Shepley 
could duck he swung a heavy left 
cross to Shepley ’s mouth, knocking 
him back onto the sand with a 
bloody face. 

Traxel roared with amusement as 
Shepley lay there stunned, then 
knelt down, sympathetically examin- 



18 



IF 




ing Shepley’s face in the light thrown 
by the expanding persona within the 
tomb. Bridges whooped with sur- 
prise, gaping like a startled ape at 
the sumptuous golden mirage of the 
enchantress. 

“How did you find me?” Shepley 
muttered thickly. “I doubletracked 
a dozen times.” 

Traxel smiled. “We didn’t follow 
you, chum. We followed the rail.” 
He pointed down at the silver thread 
of the metal strip, plainly visible in 
the dawn light almost ten miles 
away. “The gyro-car cleaned the 
rail, it led us straight here. Ah, hello. 
Doctor,” he greeted the Old Man as 
he climbed the slope and slumped 
down wearily beside Shepley. “I take 
it we have you to thank for this dis- 
covery. Don’t worry. Doctor, I 
shan’t forget you.” 

“Many thanks,” the Old Man said 
flatly. He helped Shepley to sit up, 
frowning at his split lips. “Aren’t 
you taking everything too seriously, 
Traxel? You’re becoming crazed 
with greed. Let the boy have this 
tomb. There are plenty more.” 

The patterns of light across the 
sand dimmed and broke as Bridges 
plunged through the persona to- 
wards the rear of the chancel. Weak- 
ly Shepley tried to stand up, but the 
Old Man held him back. Traxel 
shrugged. “Too late, Doctor.” He 
looked over his shoulder at the per- 
sona, ruefully shaking his head in 
acknowledgment of its magnificence. 
“These 10th Dynasty graves are stu- 
pendous. But there’s something curi- 
ous about this one.” 



H e was still staring at it reflec- 
tively a minute later when 
Bridges emerged. 

“Boy, that was a crazy one, Trax- 
el! For a second I thought it was a 
dud.” He handed the three canisters 
to Traxel, who weighed two oTthem 
in one hand against the other. 
Bridges added: “Kinda • light, aren’t 
they?” 

Traxel began to pry them open 
with a wrench. “Are you certain 
there are no more in there?” 

“Hundred per cent. Have a look 
yourself.” 

Two of the cans were empty, the 
tape spools missing. The third was 
only half full, a mere three-inch 
width of tape in its center. Bridges 
bellowed in pain: “The kid robbed 
us. I can’t believe it!” Traxel waved 
him away and went over to the Old 
Man, who was staring in at the now 
flickering persona. The two men ex- 
changed glances, then nodded slowly 
in confirmation. With a short laugh 
Traxel kicked at the can containing 
the half reel of tape, jerking the 
spool out onto the sand, where it 
began to unravel in the quietly mov- 
ing air. Bridges protested but Traxel 
shook his head. 

“It is a dud. Go and have a close 
look at the image.” When Bridges 
peered at it blankly he explained: 
“The woman there was dead when 
the matrices were recorded. She’s 
beautiful all right — as poor Shepley 
here discovered — but it’s all too 
literally skin deep. That’s why there’s 
only half a can of data. No nervous 
system, no musculature or internal 



TBE TIME TOMBS

CH-gans ~ Imt a beautiful gdden 
husk. This is a mortuary tomb. If 
you resurrected her you’d have an 
ice-cold corpse on your hands.” 

“But why?” Bridges rasped. 
“What’s the point?” 

Traxel gestured expansively. “It’s 
immortality of a kind. Perhaps she 
died suddenly, and this was the next 
best thing. When the Doctor first 
came here there were a lot of mor- 
tuary tombs of young children being 
found. If I remember he had some- 
thing of a reputation for always leav- 
ing them intact. A typical piece of 
highbrow sentimentality — giving 
immortality only to the dead. Agree, 
Doctor?” 

Before the Old Man could reply 
a voice shouted from below, there 
was a nearby roaring hiss of an 
ascending signal rocket and a vivid 
red star-shell burst over the lake be- 
low, spitting incandescent fragments 
over them. Traxel and Bridges leapt 
forwards, saw two men in a sand- 
car pointing up at them, three mc»*e 
vehicles converging across the lake 
half a mile away. 

“The time-wardens!” Traxel 
shouted. Bridges picked up the tool 
bag and the two men raced across 
the slope towards the half-track, the 
Old Man hobbling after them. He 
turned back to -wait for Shepley, who 
was still sitting on the ground where 
he had - fallen, watching the image 
inside the pavilion. 

“Shepley! Come on, lad, pull your- 
self together! You’ll get ten years!” 

When Shepley made no reply he 
reached up to the side of the half- 

20 



track as Traxel reversed it expertly 
out of the morraine of sand, let 
Bridges swing him aboard. “Shep- 
ley!” he called again. Traxel hesi- 
tated, then roared away as a second 
star-shell exploded. 

S hepley tried to reach the tape, 
but the stampeding feet had se- 
vered it at several points, and the 
loose ends, which he had numbly 
thought of trying to reinsert into 
the projector, now fluttered around 
him in the sand. Below, he could 
hear the sounds of flight and pur- 
suit, the warning crack of a rifle, 
engines baying and plunging, as 
Traxel eluded the time- war dens, but 
he kept his eyes fixed on the image 
within the tomb. Already it had be- 
gun to fragment, fading against the 
mounting sunlight. Getting slowly to 
his feet, he entered the tomb and 
closed the battered doors. 

Still magnificent upon her bier, 
the enchantress lay back between 
the great wings. Motionless for so 
long, she had at last been galvanized 
into life, and a jerking syncopated 
rhythm rippled through her body. 
The wings shook uneasily, and a 
series of tremors disturbed the base 
of the catafalque, so that the wom- 
an’s feet danced an exquisitely flick- 
ering minuet, the toes darting from 
side to side with untiring speed. 
Higher up, her wide smooth hips 
jostled each other in a jaunty mock 
tango. 

He watched until only the face re- 
mained, a few disconnected traces 
of the wings and catafalque jerking 



ir 




faintly in the darkness, then made 
his way out of the tomb. 

Outside, in the cool morning light, 
the time-wardens were waiting for 
him, hands on the hips of their white 
uniforms. One was holding the empty 
canisters, turning the fluttering 
strands of tape over with his foot 
as they drifted away. 

The other took Shepley’s arm and 
steered him down to the car. 

“Traxel’s gang,” he said to the 
driver. “This must be a new recruit.” 
He glanced dourly at the blood 
around Shepley’s mouth. “Looks as 
if they’ve been fighting over the 
spoils.” 

The driver pointed to the three 
drums. “Stripped?” 

The man carrying them nodded. 
“All three. And they were 10th Dy- 
nasty.” He shackled Shepley’s wrists 
to the dashboard. “Too bad, son, 
you’ll be doing ten yourself soon. 
It’ll seem like ten thousand.” 
“Unless it was a dud,” the driver 
rejoined, eyeing Shepley with some 
sympathy. “You know, one of those 
freak mortuary tombs,” 

Shepley straightened his bruised 
mouth. “It wasn’t,” he said firmly. 

The driver glanced warningly at 
the other wardens. “What about the 
tape blowing away up there?” 
Shepley looked up at the tomb 
spluttering faintly below the ridge, 
its light almost gone. “That’s just the 
persona,” he said. “The empty skin.” 
As the engine surged forward he 
listened to the three empty drums 
hit the floor behind the seat

**You’ve a personal interest in this 
claim, Retief?** 

“Every day you wait is costing 
them money. That hulk they use for 
an ore-carrier is in a parking orbit 
piling up demurrage.” 

“I see you’ve become emotionally 
involved in the affairs of a group of 
obscure miners. You haven’t yet 
learned the true diplomat’s happy 
faculty of non-identification with 
specifics — or should I say identifi- 
cation with non-specifics?” 

“They’re not a wealthy outfit, you 
know. In fact, I understand this 
claim is their sole asset — unless you 
want to count the ore-carrier.” 

“The Consulate is not concerned 
with the internal financial problems 
of the Sam’s Last Chance Number 
Nine Mining Company.” 

“Careful,” Retief said. “You al- 
most identified yourself with a spe- 
cific that time.” 

“Hardly, my dear Retief,” Magnan 
said blandly. “The implication is 
mightier than the affidavit. You 
should study the records of the giants 
of galactic diplomacy: Crodfoller, 
Passwyn, Spradley, Nitworth, Stem- 
wheeler, Rumpwhistle. The roll-caU 
of those names rings like the majes- 
tic tread of. .of. .*• 

“Dinosaurs?” Retief suggested. 

“An apt simile,” Magnan nodded. 
“Those mighty figures, those ar- 
mored hides — ^ 

“Those tiny brains— “ 

Magnan smiled sadly. “I see you’re 
indulging your penchant for distorted 
facetiae. Perhaps one day you’ll 
learn their true worth.” 

U 



“I already have my suspicions.” 
The intercom chimed. Miss Gum- 
ble’s features appeared on the desk 
screen. 

“Mr. Leatherwell to see you, Mr. 
Magnan. He has no appointment — ” 
Magnan’s eyebrows went up. 
“Send Mr. Leatherwell right in.” He 
looked at Retief. “I had no idea 
Leatherwell was planning a call. I 
wonder what he’s after?” Magnan 
looked anxious. “He’s an important 
figure in Belt minerals circles. It’s 
important to avoid arousing antago- 
nism, while maintaining non-commit- 
ment. You may as well stay. You 
might pick up some valuable pointers 
technique-wise.” 

T he door swung wide. Leather- 
well strode into the room, his 
massive paunch buckled into fash- 
ionable vests of turquoise velvet and 
hung with the latest in fluorescent 
watch charms. He extended a large 
palm and pumped Magnan’s flaccid 
arm vigorously. 

“Ah, there, Mr. Consul-General. 
Good of you to receive me.” He 
wiped his hand absently on his thigh, 
eyeing Retief questioningly. 

“Mr. Retief. my Vice-Consul and 
Minerals Officer,” Magnan said. “Do 
take a chair, Mr. Leatherwell. In 
what capacity can I serve today?” 
“I am here, gentlemen,” Leather- 
well said, putting an immense yellow 
briefcase on Magnan’s desk and set- 
tling himself in a power rocker, “on 
behalf of my company. General 
Minerals. General Minerds has long 
been aware, gentlemen, of the aus- 

IF 




tere conditfons obtaining here in the 
Belt, to which public servants like 
yourselves are subjected.” Leather- 
well bobbed with the pitch of the 
rocker, smiling complacently at Mag- 
nan. “General Minerals is more than 
a great industrial combine. It is an 
organization with a heart.” Leather- 
well reached for his breast pocket, 
missed, tried again. “How do you 
turn this damned thing off?” he 
growled. 

Magnan half-rose, peering over 
Leatherwell’s briefcase. “The switch 
just there — on the arm.” 

The executive fumbled. There was 
a dicky and the chair subsided with 
a sigh of compressed air. 

“That’s better.” Leatherwell drew 
out a long slip of blue paper. 

“To alleviate the Wedom and 
brighten the lives of that hardy group 
of Terrestrials laboring here on 
Ceres to bring free enterprise to the 
Belt, General Minerals is presenting 
to the Consulate — on their behalf 
— one hundred thousand credits for 
the construction of a Joy Center, to 
be equipped with the latest and finest 
in recreational equipment, including 
a Gourmet Model C banquet synthe- 
sizer, a forty-foot sublimation cham- 
ber, a five thousand tape library — 
with a number of choice items un- 
obtainable in Boston — a twenty- 
foot Tri-D tank and other amenities 
too numerous to mention.” Leather- 
well leaned back, beaming expect- 
antly. 

“Why, Mr. Leatherwell. We’re 
overwhelmed, of course.” Magnan 
smiled dazedly past the briefcase. 



”But I wonder if ifs quite proper. 

“The gift is to the people, Mr. 
Consul. You merely accept on their 
behalf.” 

“I wonder if General Minerals 
realizes that the hardy Terrestrials 
laboring on Ceres are limited "to the 
Consular staff?” Retief said. “And 
the staff consists of Mr. Magnan, 
Miss Gumble and myself.” 

“Mr. Leatherwell is hardly inter- 
ested in these details, Retief,” Mag- 
nan cut in. “A public-spirited offer 
indeed, sir. As Terrestrial Consul — 
and on behalf of all Terrestrials here 
in the Belt — I accept with a humble 
awareness of — ” 

“Now, there was one other little 
matter.” Leatherwell leaned forward 
to open the briefcase, glancing over 
Magnan’s littered desktop. He ex- 
tracted a bundle of papers, dropped 
them on the desk, then drew out a 
heavy document and passed it across 
to Magnan. 

“Just a routine claim. I’d like to 
see it rushed through, as we have in 
mind some loading operations in die 
vicinity next week.” 

“Certainly Mr, Leatherwell.” 
Magnan glanced at the papers, 
paused to read. He looked up. 
“Ah—” 

“Something the matter, Mr. Con- 
sul?” Leatherwell demanded. 

“It’s just that — ah — I seem to 
recall — as a matter of fact ...” 
Magnan looked at Retief. Retief 
took the papers, looked over the top 
sheet. 

“95739-A. Sorry, Mr. Leather- 
well. General Minerals has been anti-

cipated. We’re processing a prior 
claim.” 

“Prior claim?” Leatherwell bark- 
ed. “You’ve issued the grant?” 

“Oh, no indeed, Mr. Leatherwell,” 
Magnanf replied quickly. “The claim 
hasn’t yet been processed.” 

“Then there’s no difficulty,” 
Leatherwell boomed. He glanced at 
his finger watch. “If you don’t mind, 
m wait and take the grant along 
with me. I assume it will only take a 
minute or two to sign it and affix 
seals and so on?” 

“The other claim was filed a full 
week ago — ” Retief started. 

“Bah!” Leatherwell waved a hand 
impatiently. “These details can be 
arranged.” He fixed an eye on Mag- 
nan. “I’m sure all of us here under- 
stand that it’s in the public interest 
that minerals properties go to re- 
sponsible firms, with adequate capi- 
tal for proper development.” 

“Why, ah,” Magnan said. 

“The Sam’s Last Chance Number 
Nine Mining Company is a duly 
chartered firm. Their claim is valid.” 
“I know that hole-in-comer con- 
cern,” Leatherwell snapped. “Mere 
irresponsible opportunists. General 
Minerals has spent millions — mil- 
lions, 1 say — of the stockholders’ 
funds in minerals explorations. Are 
they to be balked in realizing a fair 
return on their investment because 
these . these . adventures have 
stumbled on a deposit? Not that the 
property is of any real value, of 
course,” he added. “Quite an ordi- 
nary bit of rock. But General Miner- 



als would find it convenient to con- 
solidate its holdings.” 

“There are plenty of other rocks 
floating around in the Belt. Why 
not — ” 

“One moment, Retief,” Magnan 
cut in. He looked across the desk at 
his junior with a severe expression. 
“As Consul-General, I’m quite cap- 
able of determining the relative 
merits of claims. As Mr. Leather- 
well has pointed out, it’s in the public 
interest to consider the question in 
depth.” 

Leatherwell cleared his throat. “I 
might state at this time that General 
Minerals is prepared to be generous 
in dealing with these interlopers. I 
believe we would be prepared to go 
so far as to offer them free title to 
certain GM holdings in exchange for 
their release of any alleged rights 
to the property in question — merely 
to simplify matters, of course.” 

“That seems more than fair to 
me,” Magnan glowed. 

“The Sam’s people have a clear 
priority,” Retief said. “I logged the 
claim in last Friday.” 

“They have far from a clear title.” 
Leatherwell snapped. “And I can 
assure you GM will contest their 
claim, if need be, to the Supreme 
CourtI” 

“Just what holdings did you have 
in mind offering them, Mr. Leather- 
well?” Magnan asked nervously. 

Leatherwell reached into his brief- 
case and drew out a paper. 

“2645-P,” he read. “A quite mas- 
sive body. Crustal material, 1 imag- 
ine. It should satisfy these squatters’

desire to own real estate in the Belt.** 
“Fll make a note of that,” Magnan 
said, reaching for a pad. 

“That’s a Bona Fide offer, Mr. 
Leatherwell?” Relief asked. 
“Certainly!” 

“I’ll record it as such,” Magnan 
said, scribbling. 

“And who knows?” Leatherwell 
said. “It may turn out to contain 
some surprisingly rich finds.” 

“And if they won’t accept it?” 
Relief asked. 

“Then I daresay General Minerals 
will find a remedy in the courts, sir!” 
“Oh, I hardly think that will be 
necessary,” Magnan said. 

“Then there’s another routine 
matter,” Leatherwell said. He passed 
a second document across to Mag- 
nan. “GM is requesting an injunction 
to restrain these same parties from 
aggravated trespass. I’d appreciate it 
if you’d push it through at once. 
There’s a matter of a load of illegally 
obtained ore involved, as well.” 
“Certainly Mr. Leatherwell. I’ll 
see to it myself.” 

“No need for that. The papers are 
all drawn up. Our legal department 
will vouch for their correctness. Just 
sign here.” Leatherwell spread out 
the paper and handed Magnan a pen. 

“Wouldn’t it be a good idea to 
read that over first?” Relief said. 

L eatherwell frowned impatiently. 

“You’ll have adequate time to 
familiarize yourself with the details 
later, Relief,” Magnan snapped, tak- 
ing the pen. “No need to waste Mr. 
Leatherwell’s valuable time.” He 



scratched a signature on the paper. 

Leatherwell rose, gathered up his 
papers from Magnan’s desk, dumped 
them into the briefcase. “Riff-raff, 
of course. Their kind has no business 
in the Belt.” 

Relief rose, crossed to the desk, 
and held out a hand. “I believe you 
gathered in an official document 
along with your own, Mr. Leather- 
well. By error, of course.” 

“What’s that?” Leatherwell bri- 
dled. Relief smiled, waiting. Magnan 
opened his mouth. 

“It was under your papers, Mr. 
Leatherwell,” Relief said. “It’s the 
thick one, with the rubber bands.” 
Leatherwell dug in his briefcase, 
produced the document. “Well, fancy 
finding this here,” he growled. He 
shoved the papers into Relief’s hand. 

“You’re a very observant young 
fellow.” He closed the briefcase with 
a snap. “I trust you’ll have a bright 
future with the CDT.” 

“Really, Relief,” Magnan said re- 
provingly. “There was no need to 
trouble Mr. Leatherwell.” 

Leatherwell directed a sharp look 
at Relief and a bland one at Mag- 
nan. “I trust you’ll communicate the 
proposal to the interested parties. 
Inasmuch as time is of the essence 
of the GM position, our offer can 
only be held open until 0900 Green- 
wich, tomorrow. I’ll call again at that 
time to finalize matters. I trust 
there’ll be no impediment to a satis- 
factory settlement at that time. I 
should dislike to embark on lengthy 
litigation.” 

Magnan hurried around his desk

to open the door. He turned bacfk to 
fix Retief widi an exasperated fix>wn. 

crass display of boorishness, 
Retief,” he snapped. “YouVe embar- 
rassed a most mfhiential member of 
the business community — and for 
nothing more than a few miserable 
forms.” 

“Those forms represent some- 
body’s stake in what might be a val- 
uable property.” 

“They’re mere paper until they’ve 
been processedi” 

“Still — ” 

“My responsibility is to the Public 
interest — not to a fly-by-night 
group of prospectors.” 

“They found it first.” 

“Bah! A worthless rock. After Mr. 
Leatherwell’s munificent gesture — ** 

“Better rush his check through be- 
fore he thinks it over and changes 
his mind.” 

“Good heavens!” Magnan clutch- 
ed the check, buzzed for Miss Gum- 
ble. She swept in, took Magnan’s in- 
structions and left. Retief waited 
while Magnan glanced over the in- 
junction. then nodded. 

“Quite in order. A person called 
Sam Mancziewicz appears to be the 
principal. Tlie address given is the 
Jolly Barge Hotel; that would be that 
converted derelict ship in orbit 6942, 
I assume?” 

Retief nodded. “That’s what they 
caD it.” 

“As for the ore-carrier. I’d best 
impound it, pending the settlement 
of the matter.” Magnan drew a form 
from a drawer, filled in blanks, 
shoved the paper across the desk. He 



turned and consisted a wcdl chart. 
“Tile hotel is nearby at the moment, 
as it happens. Take the Consulate 
dinghy. If you get out there right 
away, you’ll catch them before the 
evening binge has developed fully.” 

“I take it that’s your diplomatic 
way of telling me that I’m now a 
process server.” Retief took the pa- 
pers and tucked them into an inside 
pocket. 

“One of the many functions a dip- 
lomat is called on to perform in a 
small consular post. Excellent exper- 
ience. I needn’t warn you to be cir- 
cumspect. These miners are an un- 
ruly lot — especially when receiving 
bad news.” 

“Aren’t we all.” Retief rose. “I 
don’t suppose there’s any prospect of 
your signing off that claim so that I 
can take a little good news along, 
too?” 

“None whatever,” Magnan 
snapped. “They’ve been made a most 
generous offer. If that fails to satisfy 
them, they have recourse through 
the courts.” 

“Fighting a suit like that costs 
money. The Sam’s Last Chance Min- 
ing Company hasn’t got any.” 

“Need I remind you — ^ 

“1 know. That’s none of our con- 
cem.’^ 

“On your way out,” Magnan said 
as Retief turned to the door, “ask 
Miss Gumble to bring in the Gour- 
met catalog from the Commercial 
Library. I want to check on the spec- 
ifications of the Model C Banquet 
synthesizer.” 

An hour later, nine hundred miles

from Ceres and fast approaching the 
Jolly Barge Hotel, Retief keyed the 
skiffs transmitter. 

“CDT 347-89 calling Navy FP- 
VO-6.” 

“Navy VO-6 here, CDT,” a 
prompt voice came back. A flicker- 
ing image appeared on the small 
screen. “Oh, hi there, Mr. Retief. 
What brings you out in the cold 
night air?” 

“Hello, Henry. I’m estimating the 
Jolly Barge in ten minutes. It looks 
like a busy night ahead. I may be 
moving around a little. How about 
keeping an eye on me? I’ll be carry- 
ing a personnel beacon. Monitor it, 
and if I switch it into high, come in 
fast. I can’t afford to be held up. 
I’ve got a big meeting in the morn- 
ing.” 

“Sure thing, Mr. Retief. We’ll keep 
an eye open.” 

R etief dropped a ten-credit note 
on the bar, accepted a glass and 
a squat bottle of black Marsberry 
brandy and turned to survey the low- 
ceilinged room, a former hydropon- 
ics deck now known as the Jungle 
Bar. Under the low ceiling, unpruned 
Ipomoea batafas and Lathyrus odor- 
atus vines sprawled in a tangle that 
filtered the light of the S-spectrum 
glare panels to a muted green. A 
six-foot trideo screen, salvaged from 
the wreck of a Concordiat transport, 
blared taped music in the style of 
two centuries past. At the tables, 
heavy-shouldered men in bright- 
dyed suit liners played cards, clanked 
bottles and shouted. 



Carrying the bottle and glass, Re- 
tief moved across to an empty chair 
at one of the tables. 

“You gentlemen mind if I join 
you?” 

Five unshaven faces turned to 
study Relief’s six foot three, his dose 
cut black hair, his non-commital 
gray coverall/ the scars on his 
knuckles. A redhead with a broken 
nose nodded. “Pull up a chair, 
stranger.” 

“You workin’ a claim, pardner?” 
“Just looking around.” 

“Try a shot of this rock juice.” 
“Don’t do it. Mister. He makes it 
himself.” 

“Best rock juice this side of Luna.” 
“Say, feller—” 

“The name’s Retief.” 

“Retief, you ever play Drift?” 
“Can’t say that I did.” 

“Don’t gamble with Sam, pardner. 
He’s the local champ.” 

“How do you play it?” 

The black-browed miner who had 
suggested the game rolled back his 
sleeve to reveal a sinewy forearm, 
put his elbow on the table. 

“You hook forefingers, and put a 
glass right up on top. The man that 
takes a swallow wins. If the drink 
spills, it’s drinks for the house.” 

“A man don’t often win out- 
right,” the redhead said cheerfully. 
“But it makes for plenty of drinkin’.” 
Retief put his elbow on the table. 
“I’ll give it a try.” 

The two men hooked forefingers. 
The redhead poured a tumbler half 
full of rock juice, placed it atop the 
two fists. “Okay, boys. G9I”

The man named Sam gritted his 
teeth; his biceps tensed, knuckles 
grew white. The glass trembled. 
Then it moved — toward Retief. 
Sam hunched his shoulders, strain- 
ing. 

“That’s the stuff, Misterl” 

“What’s the matter, Sam? You 
tired?” 

The glass moved steadily closer to 
Relief’s face. 

“A hundred the new man makes 
it!” 

“Watch Sam! Any minute now. 

The glass slowed, paused. Relief’s 
wrist twitched and the glass crashed 
to the table top. A shout went up. 
Sam leaned back with a sigh, mas- 
saging his hand. 

“That’s some arm you got, Mis- 
ter,” he said. “If you hadn’t jumped 
just then. .” 

“1 guess the drinks are on me,” 
Retief said. 

T wo hours later Relief’s Mars- 
berry bottle stood empty on the 
table beside half a dozen others. 

“We were lucky,” Sam Manczie- 
wicz was saying. “You figure the 
original volume of the planet; say 
245,000,000,000 cubic miles. The 
deBerry theory calls for a collapsed- 
crystal core no more than a mile in 
diameter. There’s your odds.” 
“And you believe you’ve found a 
fragment of this core?” 

“Damn right we have. Couple of 
million tons if it’s an ounce. And at 
three credits a ton delivered at Port 
Syrtis, we’re set for life. About time, 
too Twenty years I’ve been in the 



Belt. Got two kids I haven’t seen for 
five years. Things are going to be 
different now.” 

“Hey, Sam; tone it down. You 
don’t have to broadcast to every 
claim jumper in the Belt.” 

“Our claim’s on file at the Con- 
sulate,” Sam said. “As soon as we 
get the grant — ” 

“When’s that gonna be? We been 
waitin’ a week now.” 

“I’ve never seen any collapsed- 
crystal metal,” Retief said. “I’d like 
to take a look at it.” 

“Sure. Come on, I’ll run you over. 
It’s about an hour’s run. We’ll take 
our skiff. You want to go along, 
WiUy?” 

“I got a bottle to go,” Willy said. 
“See you in the morning.” 

The two men descended in the 
lift to the boat bay, suited up and 
strapped into the cramped boat. A 
bored attendant cycled the launch 
doors, levered the release that pro- 
pelled the skiff out and clear of the 
Jolly Barge Hotel. Retief caught a 
glimpse of a tower of lights spinning 
majestically against the black of 
space as the drive hurled the tiny 
boat away. 

m 

R eliefs feet sank ankle deep into 
the powdery surface that glint- 
ed like snow in the glare of the dis- 
tant sun. 

“It’s funny stuff,” Sam’s voice 
sounded in his ear. “Under a gee of 
gravity, you’d sink out of sight. The 
stuff cuts diamond like butter — but

temperature changes break it down 
into a powder. A lot of it’s used just 
like this, as an industrial abrasive. 
Easy to load, too. Just drop a suction 
line, put on ambient pressure and 
start pumping.” 

“And this whole rock is made of 
the same material?” 

“Sure is. We ran plenty of test 
bores and a full schedule of sound- 
ings. I’ve got the reports back aboard 
Gertie — that’s our lighter.” 

“And you’ve already loaded a 
cargo here?” 

“Yep. We’re running out of capi- 
tal fast. I need to get that cargo to 
port in a hurry — before the outfit 
goes into involuntary bankruptcy. 
With this, that’d be a crime.” 

“What do you know about Gen- 
eral Minerals, Sam?” 

“You thinking of hiring on with 
them? Better read the fine print in 
your contract before you sign. 
Sneakiest bunch this side of a bur- 
glar’s convention.” 

“They own a chunk of rock known 
as 2645-P. Do you suppose we could 
find it?” 

“Oh, you’re buying it, hey? Sure, 
we can find it. You damn sure want 
to look it over good if General Min- 
erals is selling.” 

Back aboard the skiff, Manczie- 
wicz flipped the pages of the chart 
book, consulted a table. “Yep, she’s 
not too far off. Let’s go see what 
GM’s trying to unload.” 

T he skiff hovered two miles from 
the giant boulder known as 2645- 
P. Retief and Mancziewicz looked it 



over at high magnification. “It don’t 
look like much, Retief,” Sam said. 
“Let’s go down and take a closer 
look.” 

The boat dropped rapidly toward 
the scarred surface of the tiny world, 
a floating mountain, glaring black 
and white in the spotlight of the sun. 
Sam frowned at his instrument panel. 

“That’s funny. My ion counter is 
revving up. Looks like a drive trail, 
not more than an hour or two old. 
Somebody’s been here.” 

The boat grounded. Retief and 
Sam got out. The stony surface was 
littered with rock fragments varying 
in size from pebbles to great slabs 
twenty feet long, tumbled in a loose 
bed of dust and sand. Retief pushed 
off gently, drifted up to a vantage 
point atop an upended wedge of 
rock. Sam joined him. 

“This is all igneous stuff,” he said. 
“Not likely we’ll find much here that 
would pay the freight to Syrtis — 
unless maybe you lucked onto some 
Bodean artifacts. They bring plen- 
ty.” 

He flipped a binocular in place as 
he talked, scanned the riven land- 
scape. “Hey!” he said. “Over there I” 

Retif followed Sam’s pointing 
glove. He studied the dark patch 
against a smooth expanse of eroded 
rock. 

“A friend of mine came across a 
chunk of the old planetary surface 
two years ago,” Sam said thought- 
fully. “Had a tunnel in it that’d been 
used as a storage depot by the 
Bodeans. Took out over two ton of 
hardware. Course, nobody’s discov-

ered how the stu^ works yet, but it 
brings top prices.” 

“Looks like water erosion,” Retief 
said. 

“Yep. This could be another piece 
of surface, all right. Could be a cave 
over there. The Bodeans liked caves, 
too. Must have been some war — 
but then, if it hadn’t been, they 
wouldn’t have tucked so much stuff 
away underground where it could 
weather the planetary breakup.” 

They descended, crossed the jum- 
bled rocks with light, thirty-foot 
leaps. 

“It’s a cave, all right,” Sam said, 
stooping to peer into the five-foot 
bore. Retief followed him inside. 

“Let’s get some light in here.” 
Mancziewicz flipped on a beam. It 
glinted back from dull polished sur- 
faces of Bodean synthetic. Sam’s 
low whistle sounded in Relief’s head- 
set. 

“That’s funny,” Retief said. 

“Funny, hell! It’s hilarious. Gen- 
eral Minerals trying to seU off a 
worthless rock to a tenderfoot — 
and it’s loaded with Bodean artifacts. 
No telling how much is here; the 
tunnel seems to go quite a ways 
back.” 

“That’s not what I mean. Do you 
notice your suit warming up?” 

‘Huh? Yeah, now that you men- 
tion it” 

Retief rapped with a gauntleted 
hand on the satiny black curve of 
the nearest Bodean artifact. It 
clunked dully through the suit 
“That’s not metal,” he said. “It’s 
plastic." 

S2 



“There’s something fishy here,” 
Sam said. “This erosion; it looks 
more like a heat beam.” 

“Sam,” Retief said, turning, “it 
appears to me somebody has gone to 
a great deal of trouble to give a 
false impression here.” 

S am snorted. “I told you they 
were a crafty bunch.” He start- 
ed out of the cave, then paused, went 
to one knee to study the floor. “But 
maybe they outsmarted themselves. 
Look here!” 

Retief looked. Sam’s beam re- 
flected from a fused surface of 
milky white, shot through with dirty 
yellow. He snapped a pointed instru- 
ment in place on his gauntlet, dug at 
one of the yellow streaks. It fur- 
rowed under the gouge, a particle 
adhering to the instrument. With 
his left hand, Mancziewicz opened a 
pouch clipped to his belt, carefully 
deposited the sample in a small ori- 
fice on the device in the pouch. He 
flipped a key, squinted at a dial. 

“Atomic weight 197.2,” he said. 
Retief turned down the audio vol- 
ume on his headset as Sam’s laughter 
rang in his helmet. 

“Those clowns were out to stick 
you, Retiet,” he gasped, still chuck- 
ling. “They salted the rock with a 
cave full of Bodean artifacts — " 
“Fake Bodean artifacts,” Retief 
put m. 

“They planed off the rock so it 
would look like an old beach, and 
then cut this cave with beamers. 
And they were boring through prac- 
tically solid goldl” 



IP 




“As good as that?*’ 

Mancziewicz flashed the light 
around. “This stuff will assay out at 
a thousand credits a ton, easy. If the 
vein doesn’t run to five thousand 
tons, the beers are on me.” He 
snapped off the light. “Let’s get mov- 
ing, Retief. You want to sew his 
deal up before they get around to 
taking another look at it.” 

Back in the boat, Retief and Man- 
cziewicz opened their helmets. “This 
calls for a drink,” Sam said, extract- 
ing a pressure flask from the map 
case. “This rock’s worth as much as 
mine, maybe more. You hit it lucky, 
Retief. Congratulations.” He thrust 
out a hand. 

“I’m afraid you’ve jumped to a 
couple of conclusions, Sam,” Retief 
said. “I’m not out here to buy min- 
ing properties.” 

“You’re not — then why — but 
man! Even if you didn’t figure on 
buying. .” He trailed off as Retief 
shook his head, unzipped his suit to 
reach to an inside pocket, take out 
a packet of folded papers. 

“In my capacity as Terrestrial 
Vice-Consul, I’m serving you with 
an injunction restraining you from 
further exploitation of the body 
known as 95739-A.” He handed a 
paper across to Sam. “I also have 
here an Order impounding the vessel 
Gravel Gertie //.” 

Sam took the papers silently, sat 
looking at them. He looked up at 
Retief. “Funny. When you beat me 
at Drift and then threw the game so 
you wouldn’t show me up in front of 
the boys, I figured you for a right 



guy. I’ve been spilling my heart out 
to you like you were my old grand- 
ma. An old-timer in the game like 
me.” He dropped a hand, brought it 
up with a Browning 2mm pointed al 
Retief’s chest. 

“I could shoot you and dump you 
here with a slab over you, toss these 
papers in the john and hightail it 
with the load. 

“That wouldn’t do you much good 
in the long run, Sam. Besides you’re 
not a criminal or an idiot.” 

S am chewed ^s lip. “My claim 
is on file in the Consulate, legd 
and proper. Maybe by now the 
grant’s gone through.” 

“Other people have their eye on 
your rock, Sam. Ever meet a fellow 
called Leatherwell?” 

“General Minerals, huh? They 
haven’t got a leg to stand on.” 

“The last time I saw your claim, 
it was still lying in the pending file. 
Just a bundle of paper until it’s vali- 
dated by the Consul. If Leatherwell 
contests it. .well, his lawyers are on 
annual retainer. How long could you 
keep the suit going, Sam?” 

Mancziewicz closed his helmet 
with a decisive snap, motioned to 
Retief to do the same. He opened 
the hatch, sat with the gun on Retief. 

“Get out, paper-pusher.” His voice 
sounded thin in the headphones. 
“You’ll get lonesome, maybe, but 
your suit will keep you alive a few 
days. I’ll tip somebody off before you 
lose too much weight. Fm going 
back and see if I can’t stir up a litde 
action at the Consulate.” 



THE TIME TOMBS

Relief climbed out, walked off 
fifty yards. He watched as the skiff 
kicked off in a quickly dispersed 
cloud of dust, dwindled rapidly away 
to a bright speck that was lost against 
the stars. Then he extracted the lo- 
cator beacon from the pocket of his 
suit and thumbed the control. 

Twenty minutes later, aboard 
Navy FP-VO-6, Relief pulled off his 
helmet. “Fast work, Henry. I’ve got 
a couple of calls to make. Put me 
through to your HQ, will you? I want 
a word with Commander Hayle.” 

The young naval officer raised the 
HO. handed the mike to Relief. 

“Vice-Consul Relief here. Com- 
mander. I’d like you to intercept a 
skiff, bound from my present posi- 
tion toward Ceres. There’s a Mr. 
Mancziewicz aboard. He’s armed, 
but not dangerous. Collect him and 
see that he’s delivered to the Con- 
sulate at 0900 Greenwich tomorrow. 

“Next item: The Consulate has im- 
pounded an ore-carrier. Gravel Ger^ 
tie II. It’s a parking orbit ten miles 
off Ceres. I want it taken in tow.” 
Relief gave detailed instruction. 
Then he asked for a connection 
through the Navy switchboard to the 
Consulate. Magnan’s voice answered. 

“Relief speaking, Mr. Consul. I 
have some news that I think will in- 
terest yoq — ” 

“Where are you. Relief? What’s 
wtong with the screen? Have you 
served the injunction?” 

“I’m aboard the Navy patrol ves- 
sel. I’ve been out looking over the 
situation, and I’ve made a surprising 
discovery. 1 don’t think we’re going 



to have any trouble with the Sam’s 
people; they’ve looked over the body 
— 2645-P — and it seems General 
Minerals has slipped up. There ap- 
pears to be a highly valuable deposit 
there.” 

“Oh? What sort of deposit?” 

“Mr. Mancziewicz mentioned col- 
lapsed crystal metal,” Relief said. 

“Well, most interesting.” Magnan’s 
voice sounded thoughtful. 

“Just thought you’d like to know. 
This should simplify the meeting in 
the morning. 

“Yes,” Magnan said. “Yes, indeed. 
I think this makes everything very 
simple. 

A t 0845 Greenwich, Relief step- 
ped into the outer office of 
the Consular suite. 

“ . fantastic configuration,” 
Leatherwell’s bass voice rumbled, 
“covering literally acres. My xeno- 
geologists are somewhat confused by 
the formations. They had only a few 
hours to examine the site; but it’s 
clear from the extent of the surface 
indications that we have a very rich 
find here. Very rich indeed. Beside 
it, 95739-A dwindles into insignifi- 
cance. Very fast thinking on your 
part, Mr. Consul, to bring the mat- 
ter to my attenion.” 

“Not at all, Mr. Leatherwell. Aft- 
er all-” 

“Our tentative theory is that the 
basic crystal fragment encountered 
the core material at some time, and 
gathered it in. Since we had been 
working on — that is, had landed to 
take samples on the other side of the

IF 




body, this anomalous deposit es- 
caped our attention completely.” 
Retief stepped into the room. 
“Good morning, gentlemen. Has 
Mr. Mancziewicz arrived?” 

“Mr. Mancziewicz is under re- 
straint by the Navy. I’ve had a call 
that he’d be escorted here.” 

“Arrested, eh?” Leatherwell nod- 
ded. “I told you these people were 
an irresponsible group. In a way it 
seems a pity to waste a piece of 
property like 95739-A on them.” 

“I understood General Minerals 
was claiming that rock,” Retief said, 
looking surprised. 

Leatherwell and Magnan ex- 
changed glances. “Ah, GM has de- 
cided to drop all claim to the body,” 
Leatherwell said. “As always, we 
wish to encourage enterprise on the 
part of the small operators. Let them 
keep the property. After all GM has 
other deposits well worth exploiting.” 
He smiled complacently. 

“What about 2645-P? You’ve of- 
fered it to the Sam’s group.” 

“That offer is naturally with- 
drawn!” Leatherwell snapped. 

“I don’t see how you can with- 
draw the offer,” Retief said. “It’s 
been officially recorded. It’s a Bona 
Fide contract, binding on General 
Minerals, subject to — ” 

“Out of the goodness of our cor- 
porate heart,” Leatherwell roared, 
“we’ve offered to relinquish our le- 
gitimate, rightful claim to asteroid 
2645-P. And you have the infernal 
gall to spout legal technicalities! I 
have half a mind to withdraw my 
offer to withdraw!” 



“Actually,” Magnan put in, eyeing 
a corner of the room, “I’m not at 
all sure I could turn up the record of 
the offer of 2645-P. I noted it down 
on a bit of scratch paper — ” 

“That’s all right,” Retief said, “I 
had my pocket recorder going. I 
sealed the record and deposited it in 
the Consular archives.” 

There was a clatter of feet out- 
side. Miss Gumble appeared on the 
desk screen. “There are a number of 
persons here — ” she began. 

T he door banged open. Sam 
Mancziewicz stepped into the 
room, a sailor tugging at each arm. 
He shook them loose, stared around 
the room. His eyes lighted on Retief. 
“How did you get here. .?” 

“Look here, Monkeywits or what- 
ever your name is,” Leatherwell be- 
gan, popping out of his chair. 

Mancziewicz whirled, seized the 
stout executive by the shirt front and 
lifted him onto his tiptoes. “You 
double-barrelled copper-bottomed 
oak-lined son-of-a — ” 

“Don’t spoil him, Sam,” Retief 
said casually. “He’s here to sign off 
all rights — if any — to 95739-A. 
It’s all yours — if you want it.” 

Sam glared into Leatherwell’s 
eyes. “That right?” he grated. Leath- 
erwell bobbed his head, his chins 
compressed into bulging folds. 

“However,” Retief went on, “I 
wasn’t at all sure you’d still be agree- 
able, since he’s made your company 
a binding offer of 2645-P in return 
for clear title to 95739-A.” 

Mancziewicz looked across at Re-

tief with narrowed eyes. He released 
Leatherwell, who slumped into his 
chair. Magnan darted around his 
desk to minister to the magnate. Be- 
hind them, Retief closed one eye in 
a broad wink at Mancziewicz. 

. .still, if Mr. Leatherwell will 
agree, in addition to guaranteeing 
your title to 95739-A, to purchase 
your output at four credits a ton, 
FOB his collection station — 
Mancziewicz looked at Leather- 
well. Leatherwell hesitated, then nod- 
ded. “Agreed,” he croaked. 

“. .and to open his commissary 
and postal facilities to all prospectors 
operating in the belt ...” 

Leatherwell swallowed, eyes bulg- 
ing, glanced at Mancziewicz’s face. 
He nodded. “Agreed.” 

. .then 1 think Pd sign an agree- 
ment releasing him from his offer.” 
Mancziewicz looked at Magnan. 
“You’re the Terrestrial Consul- 
General,” he said. “Is that the 
straight goods?” 

Magnan nodded. “If Mr. Leather- 
well agrees — ** 

“He’s already agreed,” Retief said. 
“My pocket recorder, you know.” 
“Put it in writing,” Mancziewicz 
said. 

Magnan called in Miss Gumble. 
The others waited silently while 
Magnan dictated. He signed the pa- 
per with a flourish, passed it across 
to Mancziewicz. He read it, re-read 
it, then picked up the pen and signed. 
Magnan impressed the Consular seal 
on the paper. 

“Now the grant,” Retief said. 
Magnan signed the claim, added a 

36 



seal. Mancziewicz tucked the papers 
away in an inner pocket. He rose. 

“Well, gents, I guess maybe I had 
you figured wrong,” he said. He 
looked at Retief. “Uh. .got time for 
a drink?” 

“I shouldn’t drink during office 
hours,” Retief said. He rose. “So I’ll 
take the rest of the day off.” 

44T don’t get it,” Sam said signal- 
X ling for refills. “What was the 
routine with the injunction — and 
impounding Gertie? You could have 
got hurt.” 

“I don’t think so,” Retief said. “If 
you’d meant business with that 
Browning, you’d have flipped the 
safety off. As for the injunction — 
orders are orders.” 

“I’ve been thinking,” Sam said. 
“That gold deposit. It was a plant, 
too, wasn’t it?” 

“I’m just a bureaucrat, Sam. What 
would I know about gold?” 

“A double-salting job,” Sam said. 
“I was supposed to spot the phoney 
hardware — and then fall for the 
gold plant. When Leatherwell put 
his proposition to me. I’d grab it. The 
gold was worth plenty, I’d figure, 
and I couldn’t afford a legal tangle 
with General Minerals. The lousy 
skunki And you must have spotted it 
and put it up to him.” 

The bar-tender leaned across to 
Retief. “Wanted on the phone.” 

In the booth, Magnan’s agitated 
face stared a Retief. 

“Retief, Mr. Leatherwell’s in a 
towering rage! The deposit on 2645- 
P; it was merely a surface film, barc- 



IP 




ly a few inches thick! The entire de- 
posit wouldn’t fill an ore-boat.” A 
horrified expression dawned on Mag- 
nan’s face. “Retief,” he gasped, 
“what did you do with the impound- 
ed ore-carrier?” 

“Well, let me see,” Retief said. 
“According to the Space Navigation 
Code, a body in orbit within twenty 
miles of any inhabited airless body 
constitutes a navigational hazard. 
Accordingly, I had it towed away.” 
“And the cargo?” 

“Well, accelerating all that mass 
was an expensive business, so to save 
the taxpayer’s credits, I had it 
dumped.” 

“Where?” Magnan croaked. 

“On some unimportant asteroid — 
as specified by Regulations.” He 
smiled blandly at Magnan. Magnan 
looked back numbly. 

“But you said — ” 

“All I said was that there was 
what looked like a valuable deposit 
on 2645-P. It turned out to be a 
bogus gold mine that somebody had 
rigged up in a hurry. Curious, eh?” 
“But you told me — ” 

“And you told Mr. Leatherwell. 
Indiscreet of you, Mr. Consul. That 
was a privileged communication; 
classified information, official use 
only.” 

“You led me to believe there was 
collapsed crystal!” 

“I said Sam had mentioned it. He 
told me his asteroid was made of the 
stuff.” 

Magnan swallowed hard, twice. 
“By the way,” he said dully. “You 
were right about the check. Half an 



hour ago Mr. Leatherwell tried to 
stop payment. He was too late.” 

“All in all, it’s been a big day for 
Leatherwell,” Retief said. “Anything 
else?” 

“I hope not,” Magnan said. “I sin- 
cerely hope not.” He leaned close to 
the screen. “You’ll consider the en- 
tire affair as. .confidential? There’s 
no point in unduly complicating re- 
lationships.” 

“Have no fear, Mr. Consul,” Re- 
tief said cheerfully. “You won’t find 
me identifying with anything as spe- 
cific as triple-salting an asteroid.” 

Back at the table, Sam called for 
another bottle of rock juice. 

“That Drift’s a pretty good game,” 
Retief said. “But let me show you 
one I learned out on Yill. .”

IF • Short Story 



THE 

ABANDONED 
OF YAN 

BY DONALD F. DALEY 

The Abandoned have nei* 
ther rights nor hopes. 

They only have revenge! 



A fter her husband left her, Mari- 
gold filed a protection-request 
form and an availability form. 

She did not do this immediately. 
She stayed up for the better part of 
the night, hoping that he would come 
back. She could not bring herself to 
believe that be would really walk out 
on her and leave her available for 
confiscation, or for the slavery pool. 
She also ‘thought for quite a while 
about the possibility of somehow get- 
ting back to Earth, where she would 
not be available for either. 

She even went to the fantastic ex- 
pense of televiewing there to talk 
with her father and mother. They 
had been shocked and unfriendly. 



They had said good-by with a fin- 
ality which left little room for doubt 
as to what they thought of an Aban- 
doned. They had never had one in 
their family, they had pointed out, 
neither of them, and they did not 
intend to have one in their family 
now. They had warned her that they 
intended to report the call to the 
Beta III Protection People. 

This did not worry her much. The 
call almost certainly had been moni- 
tored anyway. If they wanted to go 
to the considerable extra expense of 
reporting it, in order to impress the 
Protection People with their loyalty, 
that was their own lookout. She un- 
derstood that, now, she had no fam-

IF 



ily. She thought for a moment of 
going up-ramp to say good-by to the 
children, but she knew that this 
would not help. 

Besides, it was illegal. They were 
no longer hers. She was an Aban- 
doned. 

She had never known what a tre- 
mendously harrowing experience fill- 
ing out an availability form could 
be. Name, age, Sector, race, size- 
classification, beauty-index, fertility 
tests, personality scores, aptitudes, 
psyche-rating and so on, and so on 
and so on. It was like undressing for 
an auction. The protection-request 
form was much simpler, except for 
that one question: STATUS? Her 
hand shook almost uncontrollably 
as she wrote. Abandoned. 

After that she did not know 
what to do. She had stood for near- 
ly twenty minutes before the docu- 
ment file, listening, thinking des- 
perately that he would come back; 
that if she only waited a few min- 
utes more he would come back. She 
had made herself refreshment. She 
had sat with the filled-out documents 
on her lap looking, from time to 
time, longingly at the entrance-ramp. 
But he ihad not come back. Finally, 
with a low moaning sound, she had 
pushed the papers through the doc- 
ument file slot. She made the dead- 
line by a scant three minutes. 

Now she knew that whatever else 
happened, the Protection People 
would be there in the morning to 
pick up the children. She knew that 
it could show in her favor if she 
were to get together the things they 
THE ABANDONED OF VAN 



would need to take with them. She 
could do this without seeing them 
and without talking to them, which 
was forbidden, but she could not 
bring herself to move. 

The red light on the atmosphere 
control blinked warningly. Soon it 
would let out a piercing scream. She 
was tempted to just let it. Another 
of Clytia’s suns must have set. She 
found that she had no sense of time. 
She had only the conviction that this 
would be her last night. The last 
night that mattered to her at all. She 
wanted it to be a long one. 
She had adjusted the atmoset. She 
had done this every night for 
the seven years of their marriage. 
She began to sob uncontrollably. 
She took her Status Married card 
and tore it in half Then she held 
the halves to her cheeks, her face 
wet and wretched between them. 

A fter a while she dialed the credit 
balance at her account. The fig- 
ures came back indicating a bal- 
ance of 1300. He had left her quite 
a lot, when you considered that she 
had televiewed to Earth. She cried 
hard again because she knew that 
he had not had to leave her any- 
thing at all. This made her certain 
(although she had known it already) 
that he was not coming back. 

She sat for quite a while studying 
the 1300 credit indicator. She 
thought about using the money to 
buy a “pick-up-immediately adver- 
tisement” on the omnivision. She 
was not sure of the rates, but she 
thought the amount might even 

39 




stretch to include a picture of her. 
She did not know. She did not even 
know if she would be expected to 
be nude or dressed for the picture. 
In the end, she decided not to try 
an advertisement because there 
would not be time enough to em- 
ploy a reply-receiving address. All 
that would be accomplished would 
be to put every predator within miles 
in possession of the address of an 
Abandoned. 

She took a dictator and said into 
it: “Dear children, I am leaving you 
1300 credit.” She stopped then and 
shook her head. The tears made it 
so that she could not see, and she 
did not seem to be able to think. 
“Correction,” she sobbed “Erase 
preceding. Dear Children of Yan, 
I make you this gift of 1300. I am 
sure that your excellence will con- 
tinue to deserve much more than so 
small a gift. I send love with this 
small gift.” 

There could, of course, be no sig- 
nature An Abandoned had none. 

She wished tiiat she had not made 
the Earth call. There would have 
been much more to leave them then. 
He had left an astonishing amount 
in her account. It was almost as 
though he had expected her to try 
to get away. She wished now that 
she had thought before taking ac- 
tion. There might have been some 
way out. 

She must have fallen asleep. The 
morning announcements came on as 
usual, waking her. She listened to 
the instructions for that day, and 
the areas announced as forbidden. 



She made no effort, however, to in- 
dicate them on the day-map. She 
knew that, now, none of this applied 
to her. 

With a very great effort she got 
up and shut off the children’s ramp, 
so that they could not come down. 
She knew how much this would 
count in her favor. Then she began, 
as hurriedly as she could, to collect 
the things they would need. She 
knew that she could not possibly 
get the things together in time, and 
that so late an effort was more likely 
to count against her. She was not 
even close to finished when the an- 
nouncer flashed, on. 

Without asking who it was, she 
pressed the admitter. She was glad 
that they had troubled to announce 
themselves. 

She offered to go into another 
room while they removed the chil- 
dren. They did not answer. One of 
them threw a sack over her. After a 
moment, they took it off again and, 
rather apologically, asked her to in- 
dicate where the child-ramp control 
was. She showed them. Their leader 
said that perhaps it would be all 
right for her to go into another room 
if one of them went with her. When 
she saw the one chosen, she put the 
sack back on herself They laughed 
so hard at this that she did not hear 
the children leave. 

W hen the children had been tak- 
en out, the leader came back 
and removed the sack from around 
her. He asked if she had applied for 
protection. She showed her card.

IF 




‘Well, tiiafs too bad,” he said. 
“Do you have any refreshment left?” 

She did not dare to lie to him. 
She showed him. He helped himself. 

“How about credits?” he asked. 

“I gave it all to the ones who were 
here,” she answered carefully. She 
felt quick panic because she remem- 
bered that she had not so instructed 
her account. She had merely dictat- 
ed it to the children. If he didn’t find 
out, though, that would be all right. 
The dictation was proof enough. But 
while she was still in this house, the 
credits were still in her control. 

“My credit indicator is here,” she 
said, holding it out. He didn’t take 
it. 

“Thanks for the refreshment,” he 
said, getting up. “Make yourself 
comfortable. The others will be here 
shortly.” 

She had nothing to do to make 
herself ready. She could not take 
anything from this house. Sometimes 
they let you wear what you were 
wearing, if it did not look as though 
you had put on your best things. 
They did not always allow it, but 
they did sometimes. She remem- 
bered that she had expressed strong 
disapproval 'of that to Yan, when 
they were newly married. Then they 
both felt the same way about Aban- 
doneds. 

She indicated to her account how 
she wanted the 1300 disposed. Then 
she waited. After a while, the Pro- 
tection People came and led her out 
of the house. They did not touch her 
or speak to her, they merely formed 
a square in the center of which she 



walked. They led her to a record! 
room where an interview apparatus 
prepared a report on her. 

“You have filed availability pa- 
pers?” it asked. 

“Yes,” she said, and gave the file 
number. 

“This is being checked,” the ap- 
paratus said. “Have you any claims 
upon the State?” 

She came very close to mention- 
ing the children. “None,” she said 
in a very small voice. It was diffi- 
cult to remember that the interview 
apparatus was not at all sensitive. 

“Have you credits in your posses- 
sion?” the machine asked. 

“None,” she said. 

“You are eligible for exclusion 
from the slave classification in what 
way?” That part of the recording 
seemed a bit worn. At least she did 
not hear it very well. 

“In no way,” she replied. 

“You will wait,” said the machine, 
“until we have a report on the avail- 
ability petition which you have filed. 
Please take a seat.” 

T here were no seats. This was an 
older machine which they had 
not bothered to replace, or even to 
correct. She stood in horror as the 
long minutes passed. 

Her number was finally called* 
“I am here,” she said as the ma- 
chine hummed, and she gave her 
number. 

“Your availability petition has 
been taken up,” said the machine. 
“You are however to receive twen- 
ty-eight demerits for disposing of 



THE ABANDONED OF YAN 



41 




6300 credit after having been aban- 
doned. Do you accept?” 

“I accept,” she said. She was so 
dizzy that she could hardly stand. 
The machine whirred and produced 
a reception-area card. She read it, 
and walked as in a daze to the in- 
dicated reception area. Yan waited 
for her there. 

“You look terrible,” he said as he 
put his arm around her. “I’m sorry. 
You made me do this to you. I did- 
n’t want to. It’s all over now, don’t 
cry.” 

She thought that she was going to 
faint. 

“Thank you for receiving me,” 
she said, according to the formula. 
“I am the Abandoned of Yan, of 
the Estate ...” 

“Stop it!” he said. “I know who 
you are! Stop it!” 

“Do you have children at your 
estate?” She asked it as one asks a 
polite, social question. 

“They’ll be there when we get 
home,” he said. “Don’t do this. I 
didn’t know it would hurt that much. 
I wouldn’t have done it if I had. 
They’re your children again now.” 
He held her shoulders as he looked 
at her 

“I came to you with twenty-eight 
demerits,” she said. “Shall I work 
them off before I come to your es- 
tate?” 

^Please, stop it!” he said. “They 
were paid when you accepted. I 
waited here all night. No one else 
could have claimed you. Please, 
come on home now?” He handed her 
a brand-new wife-status card, 

42 



“Thank you,” she said. “I shall 
try to deserve the opportunity which 
you restore to me.” He smiled as she 
recited the formula and took his 
arm. Yet he did not look as if he 
felt like smiling. 

“Come home,” he said. “Come 
home now. I’ll not hurt you again.” 
He led her back to their estate. 

That night, feeling entirely justi*- 
fied, she abandoned him. 

4 4 TV Tommy,” the children shout- 

iVl ed. They ran to her and 
hugged her. They had missed her, 
and had resented the disturbance in 
their routine. “Mommy!” They 
danced and shouted, “Mommy! 
Mommy, Mommy!” 

When it was their bed time, he 
left her alone with them. He said 
good night to them himself, kissed 
them and squeezed her shoulder. 
“It’s good to have you home again!” 
he said. His eyes filled with tears 
and he hurried from the room. 

“Tell us a story, Mommy.” It 
was the custom of the household. 

There were tears in her eyes and 
her voice trembled a little, but she 
said in what seemed to them a perfect 
narrative style: 

“Once upon a time there were 
two very good and loving children 
who found that it was their duty 
to denounce their father to the state 
and to see him publicly flogged to 
death. You must listen very care- 
fully to this,” she said, “both of you. 

“At first, they thought that this was 
a very sad duty . • • •

THE WISHBOOKS 



BY THEODORE STURGEON 



I t had been suggested that if we ever 
want to tip the Soviet economy 
on its edge and give it a good scrap- 
ing, all we need is a few million 
Sears, Roebuck catalogs and some 
helium balloons to tote them. The 
theory is that Ivan would drool 
over them just so long, and then 
start making noises like, “It can’t 
happen here, and why the hell not?” 
Actually, there is a great deal 
more to the catalog — any catalog 
— than mere showcasing. It’s a 
Santa sack; it’s the glitter of Have 
to all Have Nots; it dwells in the 
bittersweet short spectrum between 
What If and If Only. But there’s 
another aspect, one which clasps 
this department by its wonder-and- 
awe organ, and squeezes. For a cata- 
log is a sort of portable museum, a 
graph ctf progress in many ’ologies. 
What it lists is the needed and the 
wanted; and what is wanted and 
what is needed are, each in its way, 
a measure of the culture to which 
the catalog is addressed. These items 
have been screened and filtered by 
men who know what they are doing, 
to fill needs which they know exist, 
as well as to create wants which they 
deduce are ripe and ready. And what 
a culture wants, or needs, or what 



the purveyors think it needs, would 
be marvelous to a Martian. I have 
one catalog which offers you art- 
ificial vomit. Fool your friends. Oh 
boy. 

Much more important, though, is 
that the catalog — especially the 
scientific and technological catalog 
— is a parade of serious achieve- 
ments. Some of them are the sort 
of things that pop up in the “Why 
don’t they make — ” feature of the 
mechanical magazines, things that 
somebody has up and made. Some 
of these are things you’ve always 
wanted, but in new designs more at- 
tractive, more efficient and a darned 
sight cheaper than you ever dreamed 
you’d see them. Some items meet 
very special needs. Some will flab- 
bergast you. 

Did you know, for example, that 
you can now determine the speed 
of light in less than two minutes? 
Yes, you. And you can do it with 
an apparatus weighing under ten 
pounds, requiring no setup time, 
usable in full daylight while mount- 
ed on anybody’s card table. It might 
take you eight minutes to learn to 
operate the gadget, which can be 
used to measure the velocity of light 
in air or in a solid or in any liquid

ed radioactives,) biologicals (includ- 
ing microscope slides of human tis- 
sues) and laboratory glassware and 
other supplies. But the things that 
fascinated this department were the 
demonstration kits, like the light- 
velocity instrument mentioned 
above; a self contained demonstra- 
tion of the Zeeman effect, or inter- 
action of magnetic fields with light, 
and another for the Faraday Ef- 
fect, showing the rotation of the 
plane of polarized light in a mag- 
netic field; a two-page spread of 
really fascinating “Physics Para- 
doxes” designed by Julius Sumner

There are eight of these Paradoxes 
in the catalog. 

C limbing down from the high- 
budget area of demonstration 
materials, and leafing past the jars 
of frogs, starfish and worms for dis- 
section and the pages of listings of 
physics and electrical supplies, we 
come to something worth reaching 
into the jeans for right now. We’ve 
all heard of teaching machines and 
the remarkable results they have ob- 
tained. Well, Cenco has one for 
$2.95. Programs for it, running to 
about 500 frames each on a roll

ing, with other subjects forthcoming. 

Constant companion on our desk 
for years has been the big Lafayette 
Radio and Electronics catalog. Not 
long ago we built an intercom be- 
tween house and studio with one of 
their kits, with our blackbanged 
Marion doing most of the soldering.

Lafayette’s two deadly rivals, Al-

somewhat similiar services, and each

THE 

TEN - POINT 
PRINCESS 

BY J. T. MC INTOSH 



She was a Princess of Love — 
so the aliens said. But what 
she did spoke only of hatred I 



I 

T he Leisure Club in Leonta City 
claimed with some justice to 
cater to all tastes. On the night of 
April 7th two hundred Leontans and 
a hundred Terrans, all Army or Na- 
val personnel, were making use of its 
facilities. 

In one small room four men were 
attempting to play Beethoven’s sev- 
enth string quartet. Op. 59, No 1. 
The cellist, a colonel, was sweating 
over his solos. He didn’t mind that 
the leader of the quartet was a ser- 
geant. But that his technical supre- 



macy should be so overwhelming 
seemed hardly fair. Not for the first 
time, the colonel considered with- 
drawing from the quartet in the in- 
terests of discipline. The disciplinary 
problems of the Terran occupying 
forces on Leonta were bad enough 
without adding to them. 

In another room five men, all 
Terran Army officers, played poker 
for high stakes. In the bar the in- 
evitable hard drinking was going on, 
with the stem Leontan bartenders 
watching silently to make sure that 
nobody however dmnk, got out of 
line.

■§ 






:t^^i 





The Leisure Club was not a dive. 
The Terran occupation troops who 
wished it was were out of luck. 
There wasn’t a dive in Leonta City. 
Serving-men’s wants were not sup- 
plied on Leonta as soldiers’ simple 
needs usually are. The local standard 
of living being high, the strangers’ 
money for once didn’t shout in tones 
which demanded attention. 

Army and Navy personnel of all 
ranks were freely admitted to the 
Leisure Club, but only on Leontan 
terms. It had already been demon- 
strated several times that the Club 
was quite prepared to bar all troops 
if the requisite standard of behavior 
was not observed. And some individ- 
uals were barred permanently. 

Over twenty men were in the writ- 
ing room, writing home. The variety 
theater, though small, didn’t have 
quite a full house, and soldiers com- 
prised less than half of the audience, 
the majority being Leontans. Leon- 
tan variety was too deep, subtle and 
serious for most serving-men. There 
weren’t enough belly-laughs and 
there weren’t nearly enough girls. On 
most other worlds the entertainment 
would quickly have been changed to 
appeal more to the large occupying 
forces. On Leonta everything stayed 
exactly as it was. If the uninvited 
visitors didn’t .like what was on offer, 
they didn’t have to come. 

Mosl civilized forms of relaxation 
were catered for under the roof of 
the Leisure Club. But there was no 
dancing, because there weren’t 
enough girls. There were never 
enough girls. 



The fact that there were some 
Terran nurses didn’t help much, the 
ratio of men to girls being about 
twenty to one. It would almost have 
been better if there had been no 
Terran girls at all. 

Usually, again, the local popula- 
tion of any ten-point human world 
would have eagerly supplied the de- 
ficiency. But Leonta’s situation was 
not usual. Leonta was a highly civi- 
lized world at least as rich as Earth, 
and with the planet’s wealth better 
distributed. Leonta, although beaten 
in three wars and compelled to put 
up with an army of occupation, had 
lost none of her pride and self-re- 
spect. Any low-grade Leontans who 
would have bowed and scraped in 
order to fleece the Terrans were 
kept firmly in line by the other nine- 
ty-five per cent. 

The Number One deficiency of 
lonely men far from home was 
therefore more deeply felt on Leon- 
ta than it had ever been anywhere 
else. 

Yet there was one small, surprising 
slit in the curtain. 

T he heavy drapes over an alcove 
in the bar slid smoothly open to 
reveal a girl reclining on a sofa. 
Every male head turned instantly. 

She could have been Terran but 
for the uncanny perfection of her 
pale skin. Her combination of intel- 
ligence, cool aloofness and conscious 
provocation was enough to drive 
most men to anything short of mur- 
der — and some men, perhaps, all 
the way. 



48 



IF 




Her natural attractions were aug- 
mented by every artifice to raise her 
sales appeal, for the alcove was a 
shop window. That any girl in that 
particular shop window would have 
a perfect figure could be taken for 
granted. It was therefore unneces- 
sary for the revelation of her charms 
to be vulgarly ostentatious. A few 
dramatic slits and plunges showed 
that she wore nothing but her bubble- 
thin black dress; the remarkable 
shape she revealed was all her own. 
Bright white lighting which few Ter- 
ran women could have stood told 
frankly the truth and the whole 
truth about her natural talent. 

Naturally she wasn’t in the shop 
window long. Soon she was with a 
young Army captain, smiling and sip- 
ping a glass of wine. A sergeant who 
tried to butt in was warned by a 
small, cold look from the girl to keep 
his distance. The captain also waved 
him awav irritably. 

When he failed to heed either 
brush-off, the girl nodded to the bar- 
tenders. The sergeant was promptly 
deposited on the sidewalk outside. He 
protested bitterly but quietly, well 
aware that if the Leisure Club was 
cleared on his account he would suf- 
fer far more at the hands of resentful 
Army and Navy officers than his of- 
ficial punishment for creating an in- 
cident, which would be severe. 

The girl Oeea remained in the bar 
with the captain for about an hour, 
then they disappeared together. It 
was only then that the envious offi- 
cers and men who had been looking 
on became really jealous. 



The opportunity to talk to a girl 
like Oeea was open to all. Most Love 
Princesses worked their way consci- 
entiously through the entire list of 
bidders, Terran and Leontan, before 
making their choice. Oeea, however, 
had obviously made up her paind al- 
ready. All the others were going to 
be unlucky. 

Why didn’t the Leontans, such 
sticklers for convention, stick to their 
own rules? 

Half an hour later, the sergeant 
who had been ejected from the club, 
having managed to get into the build- 
ing again somehow, found the cap- 
tain beating Oeea brutally, sinking 
his fists into her body in an ecstasy of 
sadism. 

Oeea was bearing this in silence, 
but the sergeant did not. With a roar 
of rage he seized a metal ornament 
and hit the captain with all his 
strength. Before the stricken man 
reached the floor he was dead. 

II 

T he pilot on the landing barge 
made a fast, unnecessarily showy 
landing. Major Nigel Duke stepped 
onto solid earth, albeit Leontan 
earth, with some thankfulness. Tra- 
ditionally the Army didn’t altogether 
trust the Navy, and this mistrust had 
been carried into space. On solid 
ground, anywhere, any Army officer 
felt at least two inches taller. 

Duke didn’t get a chance to see 
anything of Leona. He was whisked 
straight to General Bailey, or at 
least to General Bailey’s waiting- 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS

room, without an opportunity to 
learn anything about the planet be- 
yond the fact that it was cold. Not 
icy cold, just windy-rainy cold. The 
kind of world which forced its in- 
habitants, if they happened to be hu- 
man, to be hard-working and brisk 
and efficient, because there was no 
temptation to lie in the sun, drink 
long, cool drinks and do as little as 
possible else. 

Duke was a young major, a tall, 
tow-haired skeleton with whom no- 
body ever took any chances, because 
he looked the kind of officer who 
would relax only after the proper 
formal foundations had been laid. 
This impression was correct. Major 
Duke, an expert in military law, car- 
ried legalistic caution into every de- 
partment of his life. 

General Bailey didn’t keep him 
waiting long. And when he was ad- 
mitted, the general wasted no time 
at all. Duke knew why he had been 
sent for before he completed the act 
of sitting down. 

“I want you to get a man shot. 
Major,” Bailey said abruptly. “You’re 
to be trial judge advocate at a gen- 
eral court-martial on Friday. And I 
want a verdict of guilty and a death 
sentence.” 

Duke, who had said practically 
nothing so far, said nothing now. 
With General Bailey, obviously, you 
verv soon knew exactly where you 
stood. 

Bailey was a small, bullet-headed 
man with all the aggressiveness of 
small men in high positions, tem- 
pered by a blunt correctness. ‘T guess 



you know Leonta’s historical back- 
ground,” he said, “so I won’t bother 
you with that. Have you spoken to 
anyone who’s served here recently?” 
“No, sir.” 

“You’re straight out from Earth?” 
“I’ve been with the fleet law pool 
for ten months. During that time I’ve 
been temporarily assigned to Ara- 
minta, Deeswood and Hermitage. 
Never Leonta.” 

“I know that. I fought here and 
I’ve been in command of the occupy- 
ing troops since the armistice six 
years ago. Well, I guess you’re won- 
dering why I sent for a hot-shot trial 
lawyer to prosecute. The truth is, 
Major, the only law man I’ve got 
whom I might trust with this case is 
already in it — defending. Morgen- 
stern asked for Major Francis, and 
in the circumstances he had to get 
him.” 

Bailey paused as if willing Duke to 
ask questions. Duke waited for him 
to make his own explanations in his 
own way. 

“Cigarettes in that box, Major,” 
Bailey said. “I don’t use them, but — ” 
“I don’t either, sir.” 

“Don’t you? Good. Well, Major, 
here’s the situation. The Leontans 
have fought three tough wars with us 
and they only stopped because they 
realize now that we’re too big for 
them They’re not scared of us. And 
they don’t hate us. They just want 
rid of us. The situation here is mod- 
erately stable but uneasy. They stick 
to all the military and civil agree- 
ments and never fail to point out 
every infringement on our part, ma-

IF 




jor or minor, by anybody from me 
down to the rawest rookie from 
Earth.” 

Duke nodded. He had heard about 
the Leontans: proud, independent, 
hard-working, cultured. They might 
have been super-Germans. 

“The Leisure Club in Leonta City 
is open to all ranks, but only just. If 
anybody doesn’t behave, he gets 
thrown out. The Leontans organize 
their entertainments as they organize 
most things — with more organiza- 
tion than entertainment. They don’t 
put on a special show for us. They 
run their world their way, and we 
have to conform. 

“In the Leisure Club you can 
drink, gamble, listen to classical 
music, paint, sculpt, take arty photo- 
graphs, read, write, put on amateur 
theatricals. It’s a recreation center 
catering for everything but with a 
strong bias toward culture. Guys 
who like string quartets and long-hair 
stuff get on fine. The ordinary Joe 
who can’t see past women and booze 
isn’t so happy. He can drink, but he 
isn’t supposed to get stinko. And as 
for women ...” 

“The local girls won’t play?” said 
Duke, because this time the general’s 
silence positively commanded some 
response. 

“As a rule, no. There’s no out- 
right ban.” 

D uke suspected from the gen- 
eral’s tight-lipped reluctance to 
continue along this line that he was 
something of an ascetic. Just as Duke 
was deciding, however, that if in- 



formation on this head was going to 
be necessary he’d have to get it from 
somebody else, Bailey plunged re- 
solutely on. 

“Some of our boys are fixed up 
fine, which is all right from every- 
body’s point of view so long as they 
have the sense to keep quiet about it. 
But in general — no girls, except for 
one rather curious Leontan custom.” 

Bailey’s mouth set disapprovingly, 
and his words came out like little 
icicles. “I like the Leontans all right. 
Major. I guess I even respect them. 
But this one thing I can’t approve or 
even understand. They run a sort 
of high-class prostitution, clean and 
tidy and clinical. A very beautiful, in- 
telligent and talented girl is chosen as 
a Princess of Love — so they call 
her. She goes on show like a prize 
heifer and then works her way 
through the list of bidders. Some men 
she rejects at a glance, some after 
five minutes’ conversation. Eventual- 
ly she meets someone she likes.” 

“And the price is astronomical?” 
Duke suggested. 

“No, it isn’t like that. On the con- 
trary, the price isn’t particularly im- 
portant. She has to like the guy.” 

“Sounds rather like what we’ve got 
back at home. Only we don’t call it 
prostitution. What do you dislike 
about the way the Leontans do it, 
General?” 

Bailey looked slightly surprised, as 
if he thought he had successfully con- 
cealed his feelings about the system. 
But he answered the question. 

“I guess the organization, the cold- 
bloodedness, the deadpan seriousness 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



51 




of it. And the way they run it side by 
side with art and music and drama. 

“Well, Major, all this is back- 
ground. Ten days ago Sergeant Mor- 
genstern and Captain Slater were in 
the Leisure Club. So were over a 
hundred other officers and men, and 
two hundred Leontans. A girl called 
Oeea became available as a Princess 
of Love. She joined Slater. Morgen- 
stem tried to intervene but was 
thrown out. 

“Later Morgenstern found Slater 
beating up the girl and killed him. 
There’s no doubt about the facts of 
the killing. The girl saw the whole 
thing, and so did two other Leontans. 
In any case, Morgenstern admits it 
himself. Major, I want you to sup- 
press any feelings of sympathy you 
may have for Morgenstern and get 
him hung.” 

“Why. General?” Duke asked 
quietly. 

“Because he’s a murderer, for one 
thing. Maybe it would be best if you 
stuck to that. Major Duke. But since 
you’re sure to find out some of the 
undercurrents of this business, I’ll 
talk to you again once you’ve studied 
the file. Here it is.” 

“You want me to read this and 
then report back?” 

“No, read the file, go to the Leis- 
ure Club yourself tonight, and come 
back and talk to me tomorrow.” 

Duke nodded. It had not escaped 
him that he was being afforded no 
opportunity to refuse the case. 

“Sergeant Bowler will show you 
to an office you can use,” Bailey said. 
“Glad to have you with us. Major.” 



M ajor Duke settled himself in the 
small, bare room into which 
Bowler had led him and started his 
investigation of the Morgenstern af- 
fair. 

Sergeant Isaac Morgenstern was 
twenty-five and there were no black 
marks in his record. 

At 10:20 on the night of April 7, 
two Leontans in the back of the bar 
saw an Army sergeant rushing along 
a back corridor. Although, they were 
aware of no reason why he shouldn’t 
be there, not having noticed him be- 
ing turned out earlier, his manner 
was strange enough to make them 
follow him. They were only a few 
yards behind him when he burst into 
a room, and they both clearly saw 
everything which happened in the 
next few seconds. 

In the room a man who was later 
identified as Slater was punching the 
girl Oeea in the ribs. She made no 
outcry, but tried desperately to pro- 
tect herself from the blows. One of 
the Leontans said Slater was laughing 
like a maniac. The other didn’t hear 
this. (A small point which Duke 
found very convincing: when evi- 
dence is trumped-up, witnesses al- 
ways agree to the finest detail). 

Morgenstern shouted, seized a 
heavy metal lamp and hit Slater on 
the head with it. Slater pitched on 
the floor and lay still. 

Morgenstern then dropped the 
lamp and fell on his knees beside the 
fallen man, seizing him by the throat. 
But Slater was already dead. 

Afterwards, Morgenstern gave no 
trouble and denied nothing. He made 



i2 



IF 




a statement of which Duke had a 
copy before him. But Duke put it 
aside for the moment, reading every- 
thing else first. 

Morgenstem had been pronounced 
sane. Statements by other Leisure 
Club patrons that night, Terran and 
Leonan, corroborated the facts as 
Duke already knew them. Morgen- 
stern had tried to interrupt Slater and 
Oeea earlier in the evening, and had 
been ejected on the girl’s order. Mor- 
genstern had been seen during the 
next hour prowling around outside 
the building. Twice he had tried to 
get in with a party of new arrivals. 
Shortly before the killing he had been 
seen going down a dark lane which 
led to the back of the club. 

A confidential report by Slater’s 
colonel stated that Slater was not 
well liked. He was extremely tough 
on all inferiors, and particularly on 
Jews and Negroes. He frequently re- 
ferred to the Leontans as “stinking 
natives.” Two years before he had 
been charged with beating up a girl 
on Araminta, but acquitted. 

There was a medical report by an 
Army doctor who had examined the 
girl shortly after the incident. Her 
injuries were 'detailed: extensive 

bruises all over the front of the torso 
and on the arms. The doctor’s sum- 
ming-up was that the girl had suf- 
fered a barbarous attack which 
amounted to torture, inflicted in his 
opinion by a compulsive sadist. 

A lthough he was trying to read 
the file with professional detach- 
ment, Duke was conscious of an in- 



creasing feeling of bafflement. About 
Morgenstem’s guilt there was no 
conceivable doubt, unless it arose out 
of the fact that the three vital wit- 
nesses, those who had seen the actual 
killing, were all Leontans. Yet it 
looked the kind of case in which the 
accused, having been found guilty on 
a reduced charge, would get -a com- 
paratively light sentence. Morgen- 
stern appeared to have had the ut- 
most provocation, and the killing was 
anything but a cold, premeditated 
murder. On all he had read so far, 
Duke would rather have been de- 
fending Morgenstem than prosecut- 
ing him, and would have given him- 
self a fair chance of getting the ser- 
geant off altogether. 

Why, then, did General Bailey 
want Morgenstem shot? Why had he 
given Morgenstem his best legal of- 
ficer as defense counsel and sent for 
a fleet law pool outsider to prose- 
cute? Did he — an uncomfortable 
thought, this — expect his own top 
law man. Major Francis, to tie Duke 
in knots and get Morgenstem off, 
with General Jerome Bailey absolute- 
ly in the clear, whatever questions 
might be asked later? 

Duke picked up Morgenstern’s 
statement thinking that it might give 
a clue to the general’s attitude. But 
it only increased Duke’s bafflement. 
It read: 

Oeea is my girl. She^s no pros- 
titute. She must have been forced 
to offer herself the way she did* 
We've been lovers for weeks, and 
we mean to get married. We nev-

er quarreled, I saw her only the 
night before and she didn't say 
anything about this Princess of 
Love business. I just couldn't un- 
derstand it when I saw her in 
that alcove. Did I know what it 
meant? Of course I knew what 
it meant. Everybody knows. 

I know all about Slater. He's a 
skunk. If Oeea had to give her- 
self to somebody y I'd rather it 
was anybody else at camp than 
Slater. I can't understand why she 
went with him. There's something 
funny going on somewhere. 

I got into the club through a 
cellar. / wanted to see Oeea. Af- 
ter thinking about things for an 
hour the only thing that made any 
sense to me was that Slater had 
got some hold on her, threaten- 
ing her family or something like 
that. 

When / found them he was hit- 
ting her like he was trying to kill 
her. I don't know what / did then. 
When 1 knew what was going on 
again. Slater was dead. Yes, I 
guess I killed him. Anybody else 
who saw what he was doing to 
Oeea would have, too. 

Duke read this several times. He 
was beginning to wish he had never 
come to Leonta. He had never had 
a case he liked less. 

Ill 

O n closer acquaintance Duke 
found Leonta’s climate as cold 
and unfriendly as he expected. Be- 

64 



fore he reached the Leisure Club he 
knew why such an institution was 
necessary. On such a world there was 
no fun in going for night walks, in 
sitting in a car, in going from one 
place of entertainment to another. 
What was needed was a nice warm 
place with everything you wanted un- 
der one roof. 

He expected some difficulty in be- 
ing admitted to the Leisure Club. But 
when he gave his name^ to the two 
Leontans at the door he was passed 
inside at once. “General Bailey called 
and said you’d be coming,” one ex- 
plained. 

It was the first time Duke had 
heard a Leontan speak, the first time 
he had seen a Leontan close at hand. 

They were one hundred per cent 
human. They didn’t even differ as 
much from Europeans and Ameri- 
cans as, say. Chinese did. The only 
thing which showed at once that they 
weren’t Terran was their skin, which 
was pale, very faintly brown, and 
smooth as matt paper. The men ap- 
peared effeminate because Leontan 
men had e.cactly the same smooth 
skin as the women. The girls, al^ 
though their skin texture showed in- 
stantly that they weren’t Terran, 
didn’t give the same slightly forbid- 
ding impression of belonging to an- 
other race. They were, indeed, more 
attractive than a cross-section of 
Terran girls, because of their perfect 
complexions, because they were rare- 
ly fat and because their features 
were never coarse. 

Leontan native speech, Duke 
knew, was liquid, consisting entirely 



IF 




of vowel sounds, of which there were 
over a hundred. Terran ears couldn’t 
distinguish all these, and therefore no 
Terran had ever been able to speak 
or fully understand Leontan. The 
Leontans, however, found English 
fairly easy and many of them spoke 
it quite perfectly. 

Duke found he was allowed to 
wander anywhere he wished in the 
Club so long as he was quiet and 
didn’t disturb anybody. 

There must have been fifty rooms, 
ranging up to small halls. The tem- 
perature was a steady seventy every- 
where, except in the sport courts, 
which were kept cooler. Duke esti- 
mated that there were about three 
hundred people in the club, of whom 
perhaps a hundred were soldiers and 
sailors and six or seven were Terran 
nurses. Of the Leontans, a hundred 
fifty were women. 

There was no obvious tension be- 
tween Leontans and Terrans. But 
parties almost always consisted of 
one or the other. The only mixed 
groups were the permanent ones — 
the theatrical company, the bridge 
teams, the music groups, the tennis 
players. Even the drinkers in the bar 
were segregated in quiet, low-voiced 
groups of Yerrans or Leontans. 

It surprised Duke that it was pos- 
sible to keep Terran Army and Navy 
personnel so subdued in a club on a 
beaten world. Yet after all — there 
was nowhere else in Leonta City to 
go, and if anyone stepped out of line 
the Leontans were within their rights 
in closing the Club to all Terrans. In 
such circumstances, Terran trouble- 



makers would be squashed by Ter- 
rans, not Leontans. 

Duke sat in the bar for some time 
just watching before he ordered a 
drink. 

It was a sick spectacle. The Ter- 
rans sat around staring gloomily, 
hungrily at the Leontan and Terran 
girls who were present, all heavily 
engaged. Why, Duke wondered, 
didn’t the Army have the sense to 
recognize this need in places like 
Leonta? Women could be occupying 
troops as well as men. Why not send 
out a thousand women in uniform? 

The answer, presumably, was that 
the Army and Navy were blind to 
exceptions. Traditionally, armies on 
foreign, but human-occupied, soil 
managed to make do with the local 
talent. The Army did not, would not 
recognize that on Leonta, a proud, 
independent, wealthy world, the lo- 
cal talent could and did say No, 
thank you. The Army, which could 
be very foolish sometimes, didn’t 
realize how it could lower its own 
prestige and efficiency on Leonta by 
not supplying one vital, priceless 
commodity. 

And incidents like the Morgen- 
stern-Slater case became inevitable. 
Sooner or later such things were 
bound to happen. 

D uke went thoughtfully back to 
the bar at last. 

‘T’ve just arrived,” he said to the 
bartender. “I don’t know what you 
drink here. Wine? Beer? Hard liq- 
uor?” 

“All are available, sir.” The Leon- 

50 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 




tan’s manner was impeccably polite 
without being friendly. 

‘‘Then I’ll try your wine.” 

“White or red, sir? Perhaps you’d 
tell me the Terran type you prefer. 
Barsac, Graves, Sauternes, Chablis, 
Moselle? Or Beaujolais, Beaune, Me- 
doc, St. Julien?” 

Rather startled, Duke said: “I like 
a good Rhine wine.” 

“Then let me recommend Aoeau, 
sir. I’ll give you a glass, not a bottle. 
If you wish it again, ask for Spring 
Water — a free translation, but any- 
one will understand what you mean.” 
“Thank you.” 

“You’re Major Duke, aren’t you?” 
Duke managed to conceal his sur- 
prise this time. “Yes.” 

The bartender said no more, but 
handed him a quite conventional 
wine glass half full of pale yellow 
wine. The charge was equivalent to 
ninety cents. The cost of living on 
Leonta was not low. 

Duke sat down again and sipped 
his drink. It was a pleasant young 
wine, more like a light Moselle than 
a Rhine wine. Possibly the bartender 
was insulting his taste. And yet, a 
cool world like Leonta could hardly 
produce rich wines. There must be 
warmer areas than this one or Leon- 
ta wouldn’t produce wine at all. 

Without warning a curtain across 
one wall slowly opened. In a recess 
a girl reclined. The Terran men pres- 
ent jumped and stared and moved 
restlessly. The spreading undercur- 
rent would have been felt by a blind 
man. 

So this was how they did it. The 



girl, presumably, was not Oeea. Ac- 
cording to the medical report which 
Duke had seen she would still be 
nursing a good many nasty bruises. 

Duke’s interest remained detached. 
It was hardly surprising that the girl 
was exceedingly beautiful. The cruel 
effect she had on the Terrans present 
was not surprising either. Although 
Duke was trying to retain an open 
mind about the Leontans, he couldn’t 
help forming a judgment. It was sad- 
istic, and probably deliberately sad- 
istic, to offer an entire garrison of 
woman-hungry men one or two ex- 
quisite courtesans a week, with no 
guarantee that some Leontan 
wouldn’t win them in the end. It was 
a million times more cruel than to 
forbid such relations altogether. 

“Ten days ago I was a Princess of 
Love,” a soft voice said. 

Duke turned his head. A girl had 
quietly sat beside him, a girl so like 
the girl in the alcove that he glanced 
quickly from one to the other. He 
now saw that there were differences. 
The two Leontan girls resembled 
each other, with the same measure- 
ments, the same clothes, the same 
makeup, the same hairdo. 

“You’re Oeea?” he said. 

“Oeea,” she said patiently. The 
name sounded subtly different, but 
he couldn’t have done any better 
with it the second time. 

Like the girl in the alcove and un- 
like all the other Leontan girls he 
had seen, she wore a transparent 
black dress with slits through which 
pale flesh peeped wickedly. Already, 
it seemed, her bruises had healed. 



56 



IF 




None of the skin her careless gown 
revealed was discolored. He remem- 
bered a hint in the medical report 
that Leontans healed more quickly 
than Terrans. 

A s in his interview with General 
Bailey, he refrained from start- 
ing the ball rolling. She knew who he 
was and had something to say, ob- 
viously; he let her get on with it. 

“You’re going to prosecute Isaac, 
aren’t you?” 

“It’s possible.” 

“Do you mind if I talk to you?” 
“You’re doing it.” 

“But not here. Will you come with 
me?” 

He rose, picking up his glass. 
“May I get you something?” 

She looked at the glass. “What’s 
that you’re drinking?” 

“Spring Water.” 

“And what do you think of it?” 
“Pleasant, light, tolerable.” 

“The barkeep was testing your 
taste. I’ll get you something better.” 
She led him to the bar, spoke in 
liquid Leontan to the barman and 
took a bottle and two glasses from 
him. She shook her head at Duke 
when he offered to pay. 

“Sorry, sir,” said the bartender. 
“What for?” 

“You did know the difference.” 
Oeea led him to a small room 
which had low, soft, comfortable 
furniture. As she poured a glass of 
wine for him, he found to his annoy- 
ance that he was not immune to her 
physical presence. 

“Must you wear a dress like that?” 



She stood back to let him see it 
properly. “I thought you’d like it.” 
The neckline plunged past her 
navel. Pale flesh showed at hip, stom- 
ach and thigh. Even where the cloth 
covered her flesh it merely veiled it. 
And her slim, taut figure was superb. 
“Why did you think I’d like it?” 
“Most men do — Leontan ’or TeT- 
ran. If you like I’ll change it.” 
“Please do.” 

She didn’t expect that and hesi- 
tated for a moment. Then she went 
out. 

Duke tasted the wine. It was full- 
er, richer, decidedly superior to the 
Spring Water. 

Oeea was back in only a few sec- 
onds. She was now dressed, like the 
other Leontan women Duke had 
seen, in a short neat garment which 
hugged the figure and left most of 
her arms and legs bare. Compared 
with her black dress it was eminently 
respectable. 

“I have already spoken to Major 
Francis,” she said. “I’ve told him 
everything I know which will help 
Isaac. I promised to testify to it all.” 
“Why tell me this?” 

She poured herself a glass of wine 
and sipped it. “I don’t understand 
your legal system. Must Isaac be 
tried? Can’t you and Major Francis 
talk things over and release him?” 
Duke thought of many answers 
and chose the simplest. “No.” 

“Don’t you have a system, as we 
have, of forgiving even murdei if 
the victim thoroughly deserved 
death?” 

“There must be a trial. If the pro- 

17 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 





vocation was great, the sentence may 
be light.” 

“Couldn’t Isaac be declared not 
guilty?” 

“According to your own evidence, 
he killed Slater. Therefore he must 
be guilty of something.” 

“And there must be a punish- 
ment?” 

‘Theoretically, yes. In practice, no. 
He might be awarded some punish- 
ment which is no punishment at all” 

“And who will decide that? Gen- 
eral Bailey?” 

There was venom in the way she 
pronounced Bailey’s name. Duke de- 
cided instantly to prove this. 

“What do you have against Gen- 
eral Bailey?” 

“He’s a hard man. The wrong man 
to be in charge here. The wrong 



Terran. If we must have a Terran 
general in command here, it should 
not be General Bailey.” 

“Why not?” 

CCTTe doesn’t understand us and 
doesn’t want to understand 
us. He wants us to persecute Isaac 
because he is a Jew and because 
Isaac loves me.” 

“What do you know about Mor- 
genstern being a Jew?” 

“What Isaac told me. Some Ter- 
rans, like Slater and General Bailey, 
hate Jews. Do you?” 

“No. You can rest assured that 
Morgenstern won’t be treated un- 
fairly because he is a Jew. About the 
other thing — why do you say Gen- 
eral Bailey hates Morgenstern be- 
cause he loves you?” 



IF 




“General Bailey fought us. He 
doesn’t trust us. He still dislikes us, if 
he doesn’t hate us. And things which 
he doesn’t understand, he hates. He 
hates and despises me because I was 
a Princess of Love. He thinks I’m 
nothing more than a prostitute.” 

“And are you?” 

“Isaac told me what you on your 
own world understand by prostitu- 
tion. It’s dirty there because you 
make it dirty. Here it is different. 
Major Francis is going to get me to 
explain our system at the trial. He 
thinks it’s very important to his 
case.” 

Legal ethics made Duke say: 
“Oeea, if you want to help Morgen- 
stem perhaps you shouldn’t talk to 
me at all. Help Major Francis aU 
you like, but don’t tell me his case.” 



“You mean you don’t want to 
understand either? Like General 
Bailey?” 

“I don’t mean that at all. I 
mean — ” 

“Listen. Even Isaac doesn’t under- 
stand. Major Duke, we are a cul- 
tured, artistic people. Please don’t 
misunderstand me when I say we’re 
more cultured than you are. I mean 
that among us the general, the aver- 
age level of cultural awareness and 
attainment is higher.” 

“I must admit that the way you 
speak my language impresses me 
very much.” 

“That’s one example. If we study 
a thing at all, first we decide how 
to study it. We take the best models. 
Thus I don’t speak your language 
like a London or New York gutter- 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



89 



snipe, but more as ifs spoken at 
Princeton. But that’s a digression. 
Isn’t it only to be expected that a 
cultured people brings art to more 
and more pursuits? A savage, primi- 
tive society has few arts. A highly 
civilized culture has many. With us, 
love is an art. Not all of us study it, 
any more than every Terran studies 
all your arts. Women study it more 
than men, and beautiful, healthy 
people of both sexes study it more 
than plain people of moderate health 
and strength.” 

‘‘Study can stultify,” Duke re- 
marked thoughtfully. 

“Of course. Do you think we don’t 
know that too? We know the dan- 
gers, and guard against them. Among 
us. Major Duke, a girl is proud to be 
invited to be a Princess of Love. It 
is a great honor. No girl, no matter 
how beautiful and talented, can be 
a Love Princess more than three 
times at most.” 

“Please,” Duke protested. “I un- 
derstand that you’re telling me that 
among Leontans your exclusive, 
high-grade Princess of Love system 
is part of your culture and that a 
girl who figures in it isn’t reckoned 
to have lost her respectability. Grant- 
ing all that, I can’t see what it has to 
do with Morgenstem and Slater.” 

“It has a great deal to do with 
General Bailey,” the girl said in a 
low, serious voice. “He regards what 
happened as a vulgar, sordid affair, 
and his disgust over the whole busi- 
ness is his real reason for wanting to 
execute Isaac.” 

She might weU be right, Duke 



thought. But he kept this condusion 
strictly to himself. 

IV 

4tJ^id you go to the Leisure Club 
last night?” General Bailey 

asked. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Are you going to get Morgenstem 
shot for me?” 

“May I be frank, sir? I can find no 
reason why the death penalty should 
be sought in this case. For my own 
part, Fd much rather be defending 
Morgenstem than prosecuting him. 
And I think I could get him off.” 

Bailey was thunderstruck. When at 
last he could speak, he said in a voice 
in which the grating of ice could be 
heard: “It seems I’ve been very 
much mistaken in you. Major.” 

“Yes, sir. You wish to appoint an- 
other officer as trial judge advo- 
cate?” 

Bailey already had himself in com- 
mand again. “Wait, sir. You’re going 
too fast. I asked for the best prose- 
cutor the fleet law pool could pro- 
vide, and you were the man who was 
sent. Exactly why are you in such 
an all-fired hurry to duck out of 
this case?” 

“Because, sir, my preliminary in- 
vestigations suggest that you’re al- 
lowing your own prejudices to sway 
you.” 

“That what you think, is it?” 

Bailey’s sudden calmness was the 
last thing Duke expected. What he 
had expected had been a burst of 
fury in the course of which General 



60 



IP 




Bailey would have blasted him off 
Leonta and back to the fleet. Making 
Bailey furious, Duke calculated, was 
the quickest and surest way of ex- 
tricating himself from the Morgen- 
stem case. 

‘‘Suppose I tell you,” said Bailey, 
“that you’re right, and that I still 
don’t feel a twinge of conscience 
that I want to get Morgenstern shot?” 
“Then I’d want to hear what else 
you have to say, sir.” 

“That’s more like it,” said Bailey 
grimly. “Listen, then. Major, unless 
you’re blind and have never studied 
any history you must know that 
every century since the Middle Ages 
internal military discipline has weak- 
ened.” 

“That’s a tenable point of view.” 
“It’s more than that. In the eigh- 
teenth and nineteenth centuries all 
soldiers obeyed all orders instantly, 
blindly. Injustices were borne quiet- 
ly, as being in the nature of things. 
In the twentieth century, psychiatry 
gave every troublemaker the excuse 
that everything wrong he did was 
somebody else’s fault. And kids, teen- 
agers, criminals, neurotics and ordi- 
nary enlisted men all learned that 
they could get away with anything if 
they put on a good enough act. By 
the twenty-second century a private 
could sue his colonel for persecution 
and get a hundred thousand dollar 
settlement.” 

“Only in a very clear, very ex- 
treme case, and in peacetime, sir.” 
“I said it could happen, didn’t I? 
In the nineteenth century, could any 
private sue his colonel for any damn 



thing? This is a trend, Major, and 
it’s still growing. The trouble is, we 
still need armies. We still even need 
peacetime armies. And in peacetime, 
on jobs like this occuprtion of Leon- 
ta, the problem of discipline is at its 
worst. I’ve got to watch everything 
I do and say all day and every day in 
case some disgruntled sergeant or 
lieutenant or captain decides to get 
me kicked out of my job.” 

“Yes, sir. Am I to understand you 
have serious disciplinary problems 
here on Leonta?” 

“Hell, Major, you only had to open 
your eyes to see we must have. The 
Leontans don’t like us, don’t want us 
here. So they do all they can to make 
things awkward. Mostly they back 
the rights of the underprivileged, as 
you might say. Treat privates just 
like color/els. Act as if we’re all Ter- 
rans, all soldiers, and what’s the dif- 
ference? Don’t you see how that 
can make things tough?” 

“Yes, I — do see,” said Duke. He 
was mentally kicking himself. There 
was more to the Morgenstern case 
than met the eye. He should have 
been the last man to make up his 
mind before all the evidence was in. 

“Now, the Leisure Club. I wanted 
a separate club for officers, but the 
Leontans said they’d open the club 
to all or none. Could I have given 
orders that the Leisure Club was for 
officers only? I could not. Then, this 
Love Princess business. You think 
it’s okay. Major? You think I’m prej- 
udiced?” 

Duke hesitated. “Ethically, it 
doesn’t seem so — ” 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



61 




“Major, as far as I’m concerned 
ethical considerations don’t come in- 
to it. What concerns me is the effect 
on my garrison. What do you think 
of that?” 

Duke admitted that the effect 
must be wholly bad. 

Bailey shrugged impatiently. “I 
could have said all this yesterday, 
but 1 wanted you to look around 
first. Now, let’s get down to this 
case. So you’ve got a lot of sympathy 
for Morgenstern? Morgenstern is a 
sergeant. He’s been here quite long 
enough to know the ropes. Appar- 
ently he thought he had a Leontan 
girl, one of the few lucky enough to 
be in that position. The Leontans 
don’t like it, but it happens. So long 
as the two of them keep it under 
cover, nobody does anything about 
it 

“Then he saw his girl on offer as 
a Princess of Love. Sure, that shook 
him up a bit. But it only proved 
what he should have known all 
along — that his girl was a Leontan, 
and liable to act like a Leontan. It 
gave him no license to kill a Terran 
Army captain.” 

Duke got the first hint of what 
Bailey was really getting at. He 
looked at him sharply, wondering if 
the blunt general was that shrewd. 

And Bailey promptly proved he 
was. “Morgenstern is either a cun- 
ning fool or a stupid fool. Major, 
but a fool anyway. See what I 
mean?” 

“Yes, sir,” Duke whispered, “1 
guess I do see what you mean.” 

“And though we don’t execute 



crazy people any more, we often 
have to execute fools.” 

“Yes.” said Duke quietly. “Yes. 
we do.” 

D uke had a busy time before the 
trial opened. There was a lot of 
work to be done, and nobody but 
himself to do it. Neither he nor Ma- 
jor Francis had been provided with 
an assistant. 

Duke didn’t meet either Morgen- 
stern or Francis until the court- 
martial opened. Five officers pre- 
sided over by General Hebbenton sat 
at a long table. Duke had a small 
table set at one end at right-angles. 
At the corresponding table at the 
other end Morgenstern sat with Ma- 
jor Francis. 

Morgenstern was not at all as 
Duke had pictured him. He was a 
good-looking cheerful young man 
who didn’t look the type to kill an 
officer in a fit of rage. He didn’t 
look the type to kill anyone. There 
was one thing, however, in his ap- 
pearance which particularly inter- 
ested Duke. He looked a cunning 
fool rather than a stupid fool — if 
he was a fool at all. 

Duke opened his case with the 
three witnesses of the killing, with 
Oeea herself last. All three were 
good, clear witnesses. They knew 
what they had seen and they weren’t 
going to be inveigled into saying they 
had seen any more or any less. 

Duke was very careful in his ques- 
tions to Oeea, opening as few doors 
as possible for Major Francis to 
barge through in cross-examination. 



62 



IP 




Duke knew that Oeea was also being 
called as a witness for the defense. 
Before Francis had any opportunity 
to start putting on his case, however, 
Duke wanted to get all the facts in 
the record. 

Major Francis, rather surprisingly, 
did not cross-examine. Certainly he 
would have his chance later. Duke 
had expected, however, that he 
would lose no time in bringing out 
some of the facts which were ob- 
viously in Morgenstern’s favor. 

After Oeea, Duke brought on a 
Captain Harry Burns who testified 
that Slater was not well liked, that 
he hated Jews and Negroes and that 
there had been trouble before be- 
tween Slater and Morgenstern. While 
this witness was before the court, 
Francis several times objected on 
various grounds, but none of his ob- 
jections were sustained. 

Duke got the impression that sev- 
eral members of the court were very 
curious about Slater’s previous rela- 
tions with Morgenstern, and since 
Burns was the only witness who was 
going to tell them anything at all 
about this feature of the case they 
thought they’d better hear all he 
had to say. ' 

Then Duke put Lieutenant Sam 
Borke on the stand. 

“You were in the Leisure Club on 
the night of the killing. Lieutenant?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Alone?” 

“I was in the bar with several 
friends.” 

“Please give their names.” 

“Captain Bob Morrice, Lieutenant 



Tom Rora, Ensign Bill Teiger of the 
Navy, and a nurse. Marge Brown.” 
“All Terrans, then?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Was there any contact between 
your party and any Leontans, apart 
from the bartenders?” 

“How do you mean, contact?” 
“Did any Leontans speak to you?” 
“Not till that guy came over.” 
“What guy. Lieutenant?” 

“I can’t say his name, the guy who 
saw the killing.” 

“Two Leontans saw the killing.” 

“I know, the other guy was with 
him. They were both there. Anyway, 
the first guy said — ” 

44/^bjection,” said Francis, on his 
W feet. 

“Objection sustained,” said Heb- 
benton. “You cannot elicit hearsay 
evidence. Major Duke. And please 
establish which of the Leontans 
spoke to the witness.” 

“Yes, sir. Lieutenant, was it the 
Leontan Eoaee who spoke to you?” 
“Yes, that’s the guy. The big one.” 
“What did Eoaee do after he 
spoke to you?” 

“Went out to the toilet.” 

“Are you of your own knowledge 
aware that he went to the toilet?” 
“No. But he said he was going.” 
With some difficulty, for the lieu- 
tenant was not a good witness, Duke 
managed to establish that the two 
Leontans who saw the killing had 
talked to Borke’s party just before 
going out of the bar and that this 
must have been before they saw Mor- 
genstern murder Slater. 

i3 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 




Then he closed his case. 

Hebbenton’s eyebrows shot up and 
he asked Francis and Duke to ap- 
proach. 

‘Ts that your entire case, Major 
Duke?” he demanded. 

*T have shown that Sergeant Mor- 
genstern killed Captain Slater, sir, 
and that ill-feeling had existed be- 
tween the two men for some time. 
What more can I do?” 

“That remark comes perilously 
close to insolence, Major.” 

“It isn’t intended, sir.” 

Hebbenton struggled with himself. 
Then he said quietly: “You know 
the circumstances, Major Duke. All 
Leontans must, in the circumstances, 
be considered hostile witnesses. Is 
Sergeant Morgenstern to be con- 
victed, entirely on Leontan testi- 
mony, with no evidence from Ter- 
ran personnel?” 

“Most certainly, sir,” said Duke 
coolly, “if you will not permit me to 
ask Terran officers what Leontans 
said to them.” 

The remark was deliberately rude. 
Hebbenton nearly hit the roof. Then 
he realized that rude or not, it was 
wholly justified. The court had the 
choice of making no distinction 
whatever between Terran and Leon- 
tan witnesses, or allowing hearsay 
evidence from Terran officers about 
what Leontans said. 

“But. .you didn’t even ask your 
Leontan witnesses about this matter. 
Major.” 

“No, sir. Shall we recall them and 
ask them now?” 

Eoaee was recalled and asked 



about the incident. He said yes, he 
had spoken to some Terran officers 
just before leaving the bar. He had 
offered to show them over the club 
and had been surprised when they 
refused. His motives had been purely 
friendly. 

After the Leontan had left the 
stand, Duke was called before the 
president again. Hebbenton asked 
why he had not brought the matter 
up when the Leontan first gave evi- 
dence. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” said Duke blandly. 

On the point of saying more, Heb- 
benton checked himself. Perhaps it 
occurred to him too that a cautious 
witness would be more likely to 
make an admission on being recalled 
after others had testified than other- 
wise. 

V 

M ajor Francis put Captain Hin- 
ton, an army doctor, on the 
stand to testify to Oeea’s condition 
after the assault on her by Slater. 
Hinton took ten minutes and a good 
deal of medical jargon to say she’d 
been comprehensively beaten up. 

Cross-examining, Duke said: “Ex- 
actly how do Leontans differ from 
Terrans, doctor?” 

Francis objected on the grounds 
that this raised a subject not covered 
in direct examination. Hebbenton 
overruled the objection without ask- 
ing Duke for an explanation. 

Hinton said that Leontans were 
medically exactly the same as Ter- 
rans except that they healed more

quickly. Minor cuts, abrasions and 
bruises cleared up in just over half 
the time Terrans would take to heal, 
and there was less risk of scars. 

“I don’t know whether this is the 
result of heredity or environment,” 
the doctor, a plump, red-faced man, 
declared. “In my view, far too little 
research has been done into this.” 
“Quite, doctor. But the fact is that 
Leontan flesh normally is less flawed 
than Terran partly because skin erup- 
tions are rarer, partly because in- 
juries heal more quickly, and partly 
because the healing is generally more 
complete?” 

“Exactly so.” 

“So if you were to examine Oeea 
again now, she’d probably be com- 
pletely healed?” 

“Very likely.” 

“Now, doctor, you said you found 
traces of previous injuries?” 

“Very faint. Almost gone.” 

“Yet according to your own evi- 
dence, Leontans heal fast? Therefore 
the previous injuries could have been 
caused as recently as two weeks be- 
fore April 7?” 

“Possibly.” 

“These faint traces of previous in- 
juries you found. Were they visible?” 
“No. They showed up in examina- 
tion with a machine which shows 
subcutaneous damage. Nothing 
showed on the surface. Of course. 
Major, these injuries were of abso- 
lutely no medical importance what- 
ever, compared with the quite con- 
siderable damage I was primarily 
concerned with.” 

“Of course, doctor.” 



On redirect Francis brought out 
the fact that although Leontans 
healed far more quickly than Ter- 
rans, injuries they suffered were just 
as painful at the time. Francis thus 
squashed any idea that Oeea, being a 
Leontan, had suffered any less pain 
at Slater’s hands than a Terran girl 
would have done. 

Francis then put Oeea on the 
stand. Duke was ruefully aware that 
her very appearance, especially di- 
rectly after the doctor’s evidence, 
was all in Morgenstern’s favor. She 
was slim as a wand, fragile and very 
beautiful. Every man in the room — 
and everyone in the room but her- 
self was a man — must be thinking: 
If I found anybody beating up this 
little honey, I guess I’d be pretty mad 
too. 

Francis didn’t call her “Miss.” 
“Oeea, the Leontan custom of dis- 
playing a Princess of Love has a con- 
siderable bearing on this case. De- 
scribe the system.” 

Oeea, demure and composed, 
made much the same defense of the 
custom which she had already made 
to Duke. But this time she made far 
more of it. 

She gave the Leontan name and 
explained that the translation Prin- 
cess of Love was only an approxima- 
tion. Goddess would be nearer than 
Princess, she said, except that there 
was no suggestion of actual divinity, 
only of supreme quality. And the 
other word in the title included 
Beauty as well as Love. The title 
meant, in fact, that a girl had every- 
thing. When any girl was invited to 



1HE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



65 




be a Princess of Love she knew that 
she’d been awarded top marks for 
looks, personality and intelligence. 

“Even among us,” she said, “many 
girls say they’d refuse to act as a 
Princess of Love if they were ever 
asked. We are a rather strait-laced 
people, you know. But hardly anyone 
ever refuses the tests, and I’ve never 
heard of anybody actually chosen re- 
fusing the honor. 

“You’re a strait-laced people?” 
Francis queried. 

“Well, aren’t we? A lot of you Ter- 
rans disapprove of the Love Princess 
system. Yet you have hundreds of 
prostitutes operating in every city, 
all the time, in the most sordid con- 
ditions, Among us, one Love Princess 
or at most two offer themselves in a 
week, openly, proudly. .and that’s 
all the extra-marital adventure that’s 
legally and morally allowed among 
us. The present case can’t be taken 
as typical. 1 made a bad mistake 
with Slater.” 

“Please confine your answers to 
the questions. You say no girl ever 
refuses the honor?” 

“I’ve never heard of it happening.” 
She looked appealingly at the presi- 
dent of the court. “I can only explain 
this if I’m allowed to speak freely.” 

H ebbenton said nothing. Taking 
silence as assent, she said: “Per- 
haps 1 can explain our attitude best 
lik^ this. If in one of the countries 
on Earth where girls are still sup- 
posed to be modest, Spain for in- 
stance, a highly respectable girl is 
asked to parade in a bathing cos- 



tume, she’ll probably decline. But if 
she’s told she’s been chosen Miss 
Spain and is asked to go to America 
to compete in a Miss World or a 
Miss Universe or a Miss Galaxy 
competition, she’ll find it very hard 
to say no. Suppose — and this must 
be theoretical, but please bear with 
me — she is told that if she competes 
she will certainly be chosen Miss 
Galaxy. Could any girl refuse? Re- 
member, if she does refuse, no one 
will ever know the offer was made, 
that she could have been Miss Ga- 
laxy. Well, perhaps that gives you 
some idea of a Leontan girl’s feelings 
on being asked to be a Princess of 
Love and Beauty. If she refuses, a 
time will soon come when nobody 
will ever believe that this supreme 
honor, this accolade of her woman- 
hood and beauty, was ever offered. 
If she accepts, she gains something 
which nobody can ever take away 
from her. When I am old and ugly. 
I’ll always be able to say that once 
I was a Princess of Love.” 

“Thank you, Oeea. You’ve been 
very lucid and illuminating. Now it 
seems that when you were offered 
this honor you didn’t immediately tell 
Sergeant Morgenstern.” 

“No.” 

“Before 1 ask you why, 1 want to 
clarify your relations with Sergeant 
Morgenstern. Were you in love with 
him?” 

“Yes. 1 still am.” 

“You had not previously been a 
Princess of Love, however? You 
didn’t meet him in this way?” 
“No. I’d met him as a very ordi-

nary girl with no thought of ever be- 
ing invited to be a Love Princess.” 
see. Are you going to marry 

him?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why, when you were invited to be 
a Love Princess, did you not tell Ser- 
geant MOrgenstern about it?” 

“Well, he’s a Terran. Suppose the 
Spanish girl who knew she could be 
Miss Galaxy was engaged to a hand- 
some, moody, exceedingly jealous 
man. Suppose she knew he’d be furi- 
ous if she entered the contest, and 
would forbid her to go through with 
it. Might she not decide to have her 
cake and eat it, if she could? Get the 
Miss Galaxy title and afterwards try 
to make her peace with her fiance? 
That’s what I tried to do.” 

“In other words, you thought you 
take the honor and afterwards make 
your peace with Sergeant Morgen- 
stern?” 

“Yes.” 

“Although it meant being unfaith- 
ful to him?” 

“Leontan girls don’t consider elec- 
tion as a Princess of Love ordinary 
infidelity.” 

“B u t Sergeant Morgenstem 
might?” 

“Yes. He did.” She and Morgen- 
stem exchanged glances. “But,” she 
added, with what might have been a 
note of warning, “any Terran who 
wants to marry a Leontan ought to 
be clear in his own mind what he’s 
doing. If he wants her to be exactly 
like an Earthgirl, he should marry 
an Earthgirl.” 

“Oeea, we’ve heard medical testi- 



mony about the injuries you suffered 
at the hands of Captain Slater. How 
did that situation come about? I 
mean, how did it happen that you 
chose to bestow yourself on a man 
who proceeded to assault you?” 
“That was mainly my fault, but 
partly due to my unfamiliarity with 
Terrans. Naturally I didn’t expect 
what happened. Sergeant ’ Morgen- 
stern approached me while I was 
with Captain Slater, whom I had 
chosen as a possible partner. I knew 
nothing of Slater, not having met 
him before. He was a handsome man 
. .When Sergeant Morgenstem ap- 
proached me, I warned him off, as 
I had to do. Then, realizing perhaps 
for the first time exactly what I was 
doing, I became impatient to get it 
all over with. Provided I fulfilled my 
obligation, I was a Princess of Love. 
A Love Princess may not take her 
title and refuse her love. I had to 
love a man or I was not a Love Prin- 
cess. Stupidly I decided that I’d stick 
with Slater and conclude the business 
immediately. I didn’t take the care 
that a Love Princess should take, and 
usually does take. I didn’t make cer- 
tain that the man I had chosen was 
worthy of me. I simply decided to 
keep Slater and be released from my 
obligation that night.” 

“What happened?” 

S he shrugged. “We talked. We 
went to my room and he started 
to beat me. There’s nothing more to 
it than that, but I’ll relate all the 
details if you wish.” 

“I don’t think that will be neces-

sary.” Major Francis turned to Duke. 
"You may cross-examine.” 

Duke rose. "Why didn’t you fulfil 
your obligations with Sergeant Mor- 
genstem?” 

Oeea frowned. "Pardon?” 

"Since you wanted, as you said, to 
have your cake and eat it, why didn’t 
you do so by accepting the invitation 
tb be a Princess of Love and choos- 
ing Morgenstern as your partner?” 
The girl’s brow cleared. "That 
isn’t allowed. If it were, the system 
would be a farce. Girls would always 
choose their own lovers. No, a Prin- 
cess must make her choice from the 
men she actually meets after she ac- 
cepts the honor — from the men 
who see her at the Leisure Club and 
sue for her.” 

"You implied that there are tests?” 
"Yes. There is a series of examina- 
tions.” 

"Then it can hardly be a complete 
surprise to anyone who finds herself 
chosen as a Love Princess, surely?” 
"You’re mistaken. Practically all 
pretty Leontan girls do the prelimi- 
nary tests. It’s still a surprise to be 
chosen.” 

"But doesn’t a Love Princess have 
more than preliminary tests? Doesn’t 
she have to pass a very rigorous ex- 
amination? How, then, if she’s un- 
dergone all tiiis testing, can it be a 
great surprise when she’s chosen?” 
"1 could express it in figures, Ma- 
jor. For every fifty girls who are 
tested, one is chosen. A conceited 
girl would expect to be the one. A 
comparatively modest girl is always 
surprised.” 



Duke nodded as if satisified. 
"When you are chosen, Oeea, do you 
have to appear at the club on a par- 
ticular night?” 

"No.” 

"Are you given warning?” 

"Yes.” 

"Then you could have appeared on 
April 4 or April 6 instead of April 7? 
"Yes.” 

"Why did you pick April 7?” 

"No reason.” 

"It wasn’t because both Morgen- 
stem and Slater were at the Leisure 
Club that night?” 

"No.” 

"You could have chosen April 4, 
when Slater was there and not Mor- 
genstern. Or April 5, when neither 
was there. Or April 6. when Morgen- 
stern was there and not Slater.” 
Oeea, who had shown no indica- 
tion of concern, distress or annoy- 
ance, didn’t seem to think any an- 
swer was called for. 

"Why.” Duke persisted, "did you 
pick a night when Morgenstern was 
present?” 

Oeea raised her eyebrows inquir- 
ingly. "Do you want me to give you 
a lecture on feminine psychology?” 
"No. Just answer the question.” 
"But that’s exactly what I’d need 
to do to answer the question. I hadn’t 
told Sergeant Morgenstern what was 
going to happen. I’d seen him the 
night before and still hadn’t told him. 
But of course I wanted him to know 
sometime. I wanted him to see me as 
a Princess of Love. I look rather 
nice as a Princess of Love. Don’t I, 
Major?”

VI 

A fter a recess. Francis put Mor- 
genstern on the stand. He took 
Morgenstern right through the events 
of the evening of April 7 — his sur- 
prise and shock when Oeea made her 
appearance as a Princess of Love, his 
unavailing attempts to talk to her, 
his ejection from the club, his impa- 
tient prowl round the building, his 
entry through a cellar, his discovery 
of Oeea with Slater, who was appar- 
ently trying to kill her. 

The recital couldn’t fail to make a 
good impression as far as Morgen- 
stem’s chances were concerned. 
Adroitly Major Francis, having al- 
ready tried to show that the Princess 
of Lx)ve system was not as evil as 
Terrans were liable to think, now 
shifted ground slightly and presented 
his case to say in effect: “Anyway, 
can you blame Sergeant Morgen- 
stem? How would you feel if you 
suddenly and unexpectedly found 
your girl acting as a prostitute? And 
not only that, but associating herself 
with a man you had good reason to 
dislike and distrust? Wouldn’t you 
try to save her? And, when you 
found her being treated as Oeea was 
treated, 'wouldn’t you lose all self- 
control?” 

When Duke rose to cross-examine, 
he knew that in a sense he was the 
judge in this case. If he failed to 
make any impression on Morgen- 
stern, the sergeant was going to get 
off with a comparatively light sen- 
tence. And if General Bailey’s fears 
about the situation of the occupying 



force were justified, discipline would 
suffer such a blow that the Teirwi 
troops would be off the planet within 
six months. If on the other hand 
Duke could tear Morgenstern to 
shreds, the situation would at any 
rate get no worse. 

Duke was prepared to admit that 
Francis was showing himself a very 
competent defense ‘ counsel. But 
Francis had made one mistake. In 
putting Morgenstern on the stand 
and covering practically all the 
events of April 7, Francis had given 
Duke all the scope he could possibly 
want. 

“Sergeant Morgenstern,” said 
Duke, “you entered the club through 
a cellar? Was it a coal cellar?” 
Morgenstern answered confident- 
ly. “Yes, the Leontans use a lot of 
coal. There’s hardly any oil left. Coal 
is used for heating the Leisure Club.” 
“Is there a door or hatch or what?” 
“There’s a sort of trapdoor with a 
chute below it. I prised up the trap- 
door and went down the chute.” 
“Rather risky, wasn’t it?” 

“I figured the drop couldn’t be too 
abrupt, or the sacks would burst 
open. And it was okay. I landed in 
the dark on a pile of coal sacks.” 
“Very clean sacks, surely?” 

“Huh?” 

“Your appearance after the killing 
has been described by several wit- 
ness. Nobody mentioned coal dust.” 
“Oh, the Leontans like things to be 
clean. The chute was spotless. I saw 
that before I lowered the trapdoor 
over my head and let myself slide 
down.” 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



69 




“Are you aware that many of the 
thousands of men in this garrison 
have made repeated and unsuccess- 
ful attempts to get into the Leisure 
Club? Men who have been barred 
temporarily or permanently? Men 
who knew there were Leontan girls 
in the Club and would have tried 
anything to get at them?” 

‘‘They just didn’t go about it the 
right way.” 

“Although all these attempts have 
failed, on the night when you were 
ejected you simply scouted around 
and found a way in?” 

“Maybe I’m smarter than most.” 
“Isn’t it true that the trapdoor is 
generally locked so that it couldn’t 
possibly be prised up. 

“I don’t know.” 

M orgenstern was so confident he 
appeared to be enjoying this. 
Duke’s questions about coal dust 
worried him so little that Duke, who 
hadn’t been quite sure, became con- 
vinced that he had actually gone 
down the chute as he said. If Mor- 
genstern had entered any other way 
it would have worried him that Duke 
seemed to be catching him out. Hav- 
ing actually gone down the chute, 
however, he felt that Duke couldn’t 
shake his story. 

Duke moved on. “You knew 
Oeea’s roopi in the club?” 

“Yes. At least, 1 knew the room 
she’d be in. She doesn’t have a room 
of her own there, but there’s an ar- 
rangement 

“You’d been in that room with hes 
before?” 

ro 



“Yes.” 

“On the evening of April 7, once 
you emerged from the coal-cellar, 
you rushed straight to Oeea’s room 
and flung the door open?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why wasn’t it locked?” 
Morgenstern had been expecting 
this. He almost laughed. “There are 
no locks in the Leisure Club. You 
can search all over the place and 
never see a single key.” 

“When on previous occasions you 
and Oeea were in that room, didn’t 
anyone ever try to get in? Think, 
now. Sergeant.” 

Morgenstern hesitated and for the 
first time looked momentarily un- 
easy. Duke’s warning suggested that 
there was something behind the ques- 
tion, that Duke wanted him to say no 
and was then going to produce evi- 
dence to prove him a liar. 

“I seem to recall somebody rattled 
the door once. What’s that got — ” 
“Are you not aware that although 
there are no keys in Leontan locks, 
the doors can be locked by a certain 
manipulation of the door handle?” 
“Oh, sure. Yes, I remember some- 
thing about that. Never paid much 
attention, because it was always Oeea 
who locked the door.” 

“Locked the door?” 

“Well, shut it, then.” 

“But on April 7, having entered 
that room with Captain Slater and 
wishing to be extremely private, she 
didn’t bother to lock the door?” 

“I don’t know that she didn’t. May 
be I worked the lock. .1 was so 
mad 1 don’t know what I did.” 



IF 




“So mad that you were able to op- 
erate a complicated lock the secret 
of which you didn’t know?” 

“I don’t know that it was locked. 
Probably it wasn’t.” 

“So Oeea neglected to lock the 
door that night?” 

“I don’t know,” 

“Sergeant, the evidence of the two 
witnesses and yourself concurs ab- 
solutely on this point. You rushed 
along the corridor and burst into the 
room. No one mentioned even a 
momentary hesitation to fumble with 
the lock.” 

“Okay, the door wasn’t locked, 
then.” 

“So the coal trapdoor, which is 
normally locked, was left open that 
night. And when Oeea entered her 
room with Slater for the purpose 
of making love to him, she left the 
door open. Although that door, ac- 
cording to the evidence we have 
heard, was freely accessible to any- 
one passing by.” 

M orgenstern said nothing. He 
wasn’t so confident now. 
“You testified that when you saw 
Slater hitting Oeea you were so mad 
you just grabbed the first thing avail- 
able and hit him with it?” 

“Yes.” 

“That object being a metal lamp 
weighing thirteen pounds?” 

“I don’t know the weight of it. 
But sure, it was heavy.” 

“It was an oil lamp. Sergeant?” 
“Yes.” 

“The Leisure Club uses electric 
light, doesn’t it?” 



“Yes.” 

“And didn’t you just say that the 
club uses coal for heating because 
the planet has hardly any oil left?” 

“It’s an old oil lamp. It isn’t used 
any more. It’s kept there as an orna- 
ment.” 

“I see. A useless lamp weighing 
thirteen pounds is kept on -the bedside 
table, the only object on it?” 

“Yes.” 

“It wasn’t by any chance deliber- 
ately put there because when you 
picked up such an object and hit 
somebody on the head with it you 
could be pretty sure you’d killed 
him?” 

Major Francis jumped to his feet 
with an objection which General 
Hebbenton sustained. The president 
ordered the last question to be strick- 
en from the record. 

Duke turned back to Morgen- 
stern. “Sergeant, when you burst into 
this unlocked room. Slater was hit- 
ting the girl?” 

“Yes.” 

“On what part of the body was he 
hitting her?” 

“Everywhere. Under the ribs, in 
the belly, on her arms when she tried 
to defend herself.” 

“You saw this, Sergeant?” 

“Some of it.” 

“So when you burst into the room, 
Slater, instead of turning in surprise 
— for he must have thought the door 
was locked, surely? — went on hit- 
ting her while you and the two Leon- 
tans behind you watched?” 

“His back was to us. And I guess 
1 didn’t make any noise at first, not 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



n 




till I got furious and shouted. And. 
and Slater was making a noise him- 
self, driving his fists into Oeea. And 
she was gasping — ” 

“Gasping, but not moaning, shout- 
ing or screaming. Sergeant?” 

“No.” 

“She was in a room with a sadist 
who was beating her brutally. She 
had already sustained painful injuries 
and as far as she knew was going to 
go on being hurt for a considerable 
time. The door was unlocked and 
there were over three hundred peo- 
ple in the club, not counting the staff. 
But she didn’t cry out?” 

“No.” 

“Although Slater had his back to 
you, Oeea could see you?” 

“No, 1 guess not. She was doubled 
up. .Slater had been working her in 
the gut. .Didn’t the doctor tell you 
what she was like afterwards?” 

“The doctor’s report wasn’t avail- 
able to you then, Sergeant. All you 
knew of Oeea’s condition was what 
you saw. And it seems she wasn’t 
being hurt enough to bother crying 
out.” 

“Hell, you heard what the doctor 
said! And I told you I saw Slater half 
killing her.” 

“But she didn’t scream.” 

“You keep saying that! How do I 
know why she didn’t scream? Why 
don’t you ask her?” 

“Maybe we will. Sergeant. On the 
other hand, maybe you could tell us. 
The doctor’s report mentioned prev- 
ious injuries which the girl had suf- 
fered. Did you inflict them, Ser- 
geant?” 



iCA >Te? Me huh? What are you 
iVl talking about?” 

“Leontans are great artists. Ser- 
geant Morgenstern. They make arts 
of a lot of things we wouldn’t glorify 
with the name. The art of making 
love with a complete stranger, for 
example. Don’t thev also make a 
special study of maochism?” 

Morgenstern was sweating. He 
looked desperately at the court presi- 
dent and then at his counsel. Francis 
was frowning at some papers in front 
of him. 

“Did you, too, inflict pain on Oeea 
with her sanction. Sergeant?” 

“Me? No, never.” 

“Then who was responsible for 
the previous injuries?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Sergeant, about two weeks before 
April 7 Oeea had suffered injuries 
comparable to those which Slater 
later inflicted. Surely you must have 
known about them? According to 
her evidence you were very close at 
around that time. According to your 
own evidence, you were lovers at 
that time. How is it possible that — ” 
“I remember now,” said Morgen- 
stern quickly. “We had a fight. A 
quarrel. Yes, I did hit her.” 

“Quite extensively?’* 

“Maybe.” 

“This was at the Leisure Club, in 
that same room?” 

“Yes.” 

“Yet once again she didn’t cry out, 
didn’t scream, didn’t — ” 

Major Francis interrupted. Ad- 
dressing General Hebbenton, he said 
that it was hard to see the relevance 



72 



IF 




of this matter. “We are concerned 
with the night of April 7. On direct 
examination, I covered nothing else. 
The events of some unspecified date 
prior to April 7 are not in question.” 
“The court takes note of your re- 
marks, Major Francis,” Hebbenton 
said. “Nevertheless, I am going to 
permit the judge advocate to con- 
tinue this line of questioning.” 
Francis shrugged and sat down. 

“Is it not a fact,” said Duke, “that 
the Leontan girl Oeea takes pleasure 
in pain and cannot or will not make 
love unless an element of mascohism 
is present? Didn’t you frequently 
beat her. Sergeant?” 

“Only twice.” 

“And on those two occasions did 
she remain silent?” 

“Well, she didn’t scream.” 

“No, because if she had screamed 
you’d have been interrupted, 
wouldn’t you? And why should she 
scream, because she enjoyed being 
hurt, didn’t she?” 

“Why don’t you ask her?” Mor- 
genstem said desperately. 

Francis was standing to object 
again. The officers of the court were 
staring intently at Morgenstem. 

Hebbenton rapped on the table 
and calfed the two counsels to confer 
with him. 

“Major Duke,” he said quietly, 
“what do you wish to establish by 
this line of questioning?” 

“Morgenstern’s defense is that he 
was so justifiably enraged at the sight 
of his girl being tortured that he lost 
control and killed Slater. If it is true 
that the girl is a masochist, then she 



may have ddiberately incited Stater 
to do what he did. And if Morgen- 
stern knew all about it, the case for 
conspiracy is strengthened.” 
“Conspiracy?” 

“This is my case, sir.” 

“To establish that,” said Major 
Francis slowly, “even if it’s well 
founded, another trial would be nec- 
essary.” 

Hebbenton turned to him. “I pro- 
pose to recall Oeea, Major.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You have no objections?” 

“I have many objections to a great 
many things in this trial, sir. I have 
bowed to your judgment because the 
circumstances are, after all, un- 
usual.” 

vn 

O eea was as cool as ever when 
she was recalled. She refused to 
lie. Yes, she was a masochist. Every 
time Morgenstem and she had made 
love he had beat her. This had hap- 
pened on four occasions. She had not 
known on April 7 that any trace re- 
mained of the last of these occasions. 
She had thought herself completely 
recovered. 

She denied everything else. But the 
writing was on the wall. 

When Duke made his closing ad- 
dress, he linked together all the little 
pieces of evidences he had managed 
to prise out of unwilling witnesses. 

Oeea, a masochist, had been chos- 
en as a Princess of Love. Duke cast 
doubt on the allegation that Morgen- 
stern had known nothing of this until 



THE TEN-POINT PRINCESS 



fS 




the curtains were drawn back to re- 
veal her in the alcove. Morgenstern’s 
previous hatred of Slater was well 
established. 

Ejected from the club, Morgen- 
stern knew how to get back in. A 
trapdoor was left open. 

“Now we come to the two Leon- 
tans who testified,” Duke said. “1 
submit that they were to be in the 
back regions at a predetermined time. 
We have heard how they tried to take 
a Terran party with them. Morgen- 
stern’s justifiable homicide was to be 
observed by so many witnesses, 
Leontan and Terran, that no doubt 
about any of the circumstances could 
possibly exist. But the Terrans didn’t 
go, and the Leontans had to go by 
themselves. 

“Oeea left her door unlocked, in- 
cited Slater to beat her, and kept 
him turned with his back to the door. 
The time schedule must have been 
arranged rather carefully. And ev- 
erything worked out neatly. Morgen- 
stern arrived and struck Slater with 
a metal lamp. I have already re- 
marked on the coincidence of such 
an instrument being readily available. 
As it happened, Morgenstern only 
had to strike once. Had it been nec- 
essary, he could have finished Slater 
off, still in his alleged mad rage 

“Morgenstern first said he had 
never deliberately inflicted pain on 
the girl. Then he said he had done it 
once, in a quarrel. His written state- 
ment says they never quarreled 
Then he admitted he had beaten her 
twice. The girl herself said this hap- 
pened on four occasions. 



“I must now say a word about the 
motives of the people concerned. It 
is a truism that a trial on a capital 
charge should never be swayed by 
the political consequences involved. 
But the motives on the Leontan side 
are all political. 

“Morgenstern merely hajted Cap- 
tain Slater and saw, or was offered, 
an opportunity to kill him without 
having to suffer the usual conse- 
quences. 

“When we come to the Leontans, 
we have to consider the whole Ter- 
ran situation here. Discipline is al- 
ways a difficult problem for an oc- 
cupying army. Solders wish to be on 
friendly terms with the local people. 
But the Leontans aren’t particularly 
friendly. And they exacerbate most 
disciplinary actions by taking the side 
of the participant who holds less 
rank. 

“Here the Leontans saw a chance 
to have a sergeant murder a captain 
and more or less get away with it. 
Now as you can all see for yourself, 
the actual outcome of the case didn’t 
worry them at all. Morgenstern was 
only a tool to create dissension.” 

Morgenstern started at this and 
stared angrily at Duke. 

“If he was found guilty of murder 
and shot,” Duke went on, “on the 
evidence which was supposed to be 
before us, the verdict would seem 
cruel and unjust, and the occupying 
army would have seethed with un- 
rest. If he was given a light sentence 
or released not guilty, the verdict 
would be practically a mandate for 
any disgruntled corporal or private

IF 




to plot the death of a colonel or ma- 
jor he didn’t like — with Leontan as- 
sistance, of course. For something 
like this which worked once would 
be well worth trying another time.” 

He paused to let that sink in. And 
he didn’t say much more. The offi- 
cers at the table had to make up their 
own minds whether a conspiracy had 
been established. There was nothing 
more he could do. 

Francis made the best of a bad job. 
He pointed out the circumstantial na- 
ture of the prosecution case. And he 
stressed that Morgenstern was on 
trial, not Oeea and the other Leon- 
tans. Even if there was something in 
the prosecution’s theories, Sergant 
Morgenstern was, as the judge ad- 
vocate said, no more than a tool. 
Morgenstern had killed a man who 
was beating up his girl. Nothing 
which anybody said could ever cloud 
that clear issue. If there was a sinis- 
ter background, the court could not 
eradicate it or punish those con- 
cerned by harshness toward Morgen- 
stern. 

Francis had a good legal point 
there, Duke thought. But in the de- 
fense counsel’s place he doubted if 
he’d have made it. For to make that 
point he had to accuse his own client 
of conspiracy with the enemy. .of 
treason. 

The court retired for four hours. 
Morgenstern was found guilty and 
sentenced to death. 

D uke switched out the light and 
composed himself for sleep. 
His barge left at six the next morn- 



ing, and he was practically ready to 
step on it. He had one of the four 
bedrooms at the landing field post. 

General Bailey had thanked him 
gruffly. Duke had done the job for 
which Bailey had sent for him. To 
Duke’s question whether the verdict 
would do any real good, Bailey said 
grimly: 

“Major, it’s only in storybooks 
that a situation is solved in an in- 
stant. I’ve never in my army career 
seen any awkward situation that 
could be cleared up like switching on 
a light. Sometimes situations like this 
clear themselves up, sometimes they 
die from lack of ammunition. All I 
know is, my personal position is a 
little more secure today than it was 
before. Morgenstern killed Slater. 
And if you’d failed, it would have 
been much worse. To that extent, 
this has been a victory and not a 
defeat.” 

Morgenstern had already been 
shot. Duke wasn't sorry for him. 
Duke at least was convinced of the 
soundness of his own case, and satis- 
fied that Morgenstern deserved 
death. 

Nothing could be done about the 
Leontans, unfortunately. They hadn’t 
murdered anybody. They had hardly 
even told any lies. They were as pure 
as the driven snow. 

Duke was on the point of dropping 
off when he heard a knock at the 
door. “Who is it?” he demanded 
sleepily. 

“It’s me, Sergeant Brown.” 

Duke got out of bed and put a 
dressing gown over his pajamas. He

twitched on the light again and 
opened the door. 

“There’s a lady to see you, sir,” 
the sergeant said. 

“A lady?” 

“A Leontan girl, sir.” 

That could only be Oeea. 

If he hadn’t already had to get out 
of bed, he’d probably have told the 
sergeant to send her away. But Duke 
was as curious as the next man. Why 
should Oeea want to see him? 

“Send her up,” he said. 

She came in wearing a heavy coat. 
Before saying a word to him she shed 
this, and then the woolen jacket she 
wore beneath it, and then her thick 
slacks. 

“You plan to stay?” said Duke 
politely. 

“Yes.” She took off her heavy 
shoes and put on a pair of slippers 
she had brought with her. She was 
now dressed in nothing in particular. 

“Now, wait a minute,” said Duke, 
frowning. “Oeea, I got your lover 
shot. I also spoiled a good plan. You 
can’t make me believe I’m high on 
your list of favorite characters.” 

“You’re not,” she said coolly, sit- 
ting on a couch and arranging her 
bare legs provocatively, one on the 
seat and the other along the back. 

“Then why are you here?” For a 
moment he had a horrible dread 
that she was going to tell him trium- 
phantly that he’d been wrong all 
along, that there was no conspiracy, 
that Morgenstem had been shot 
when some lesser punishment would 
have been more appropriate. 

He needn’t have worried. “Because 



you’re leaving Leonta. Because I 
can’t believe a man like you can be 
without influence among his own 
people. Would you like to beat me. 
Major?” 

“No.” 

She saw he meant it, and shrugged. 
“Well, you don’t have to. It’s an ac- 
quired taste, pleasure in pain. I can 
stay with you and we’ll be as tender 
toward each other as you could 
wish.” 

“I don’t want you to stay with 
me.” 

“No? Maybe you’ll change your 
mind. Major, you don’t like me, do 
you?” 

“No.” 

“Perhaps you’ll like me less when 
I tell you I never cared much for 
Sergeant Morgenstem. I used him, 
as you said.” 

Duke remained silent. 

“Major, I still want you to under- 
stand me. And us. I know a lot about 
your people. Like us, they would 
never submit to dominion by anyone 
else.” 

“I seem to remember that when 
Leonta and Earth fought, Leonta was 
the aggressor.” 

“When two peoples have to fight, 
what does it matter who strikes the 
first blow? You know that occupa- 
tion is no good. Major. If Leonta 
and Earth are ever really at peace, 
it will have to be as equals.” 

uke nodded reluctantly. 

“I’ve read Terran history. When 
you fight a war, you support parti- 
sans, don’t you? You make use of 




n 



IP 




guerrilla warfare? Sabotage? Espio- 
nage? You use fools and traitors?” 
“Yes.” 

“Then you must understand the 
Morgenstem affair now, Major. You 
must open your eyes to it. As a peo- 
ple we’re not perfect. Neither are 
you. Perhaps we have both made 
mistakes, ethical and logical. At the 
moment, Earth has an army of occu- 
pation on Leonta. We want rid of it. 
By every means in our power. And 
on the face of it we haven’t many — 
and most of them dirty.” 

Duke now had no difficulty in see- 
ing what she meant or in understand- 
ing why she had come to him. And 
reluctantly he concurred. 

Leonta was not the kind of world 
to accept even civilized, convention- 



al, treaty-bound slavery. Leonta, like 
Earth, had pride. Leonta had to right 
and go on fighting. 

And Oeea simply wanted him to 
understand. That was all. She 
couldn’t believe he was without in- 
fluence, she said. ’‘Well, perhaps he 
wasn’t. So it was worth while for her 
to spend an hour with him, perhaps 
a night with him, so that Major Nigel 
Duke would understand Leonta bet- 
ter. It might pay. 

“You’d do the same if you had to, 
wouldn’t you?” she said softly. 

“Yes,” he admitted. “Fd do the 
same.” 

“Do I go or stay?” she asked even 
more softly. 

He sighed. “You stay.”

then, was the masters’ last concession

one to humanity. 

And like most of the masters’ con-

Identically, in each network, the

PODKAYNE OF MARS 



BY ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 



On Venus, there really are fairies 
at the bottom of one’s garden. One 
flits there now, ready to kill me!

I reswallowed my heart. “Why a 
bomb? And what did you do with 
it?” 

He shrugged. “They were stupid. 
They paid me this silly amount, see? 
Just to sneak this little package 
aboard. Gave me a lot of north wind 
about how it was meant to be a sur- 
prise for the captain — and that I 
should give it to him at the captain’s 
party, last night out. Gift wrapped 
and everything. ‘Sonny,’ this silly 
zero says to me, ‘just keep it out of 
sight and let him be surprised, he-

SYNOPSIS 



Imagine me, Poddy of Mars, on Venus! Not only me but my 
brother Clark {that dryland imp of Satan) and also my Uncle Tom 
— and not only on Venus, but living like an empress and squired 
to all that planet* s lovely, foolish, extravagant Best Places by 
Dexter Kurt Cunha, who is next in line to become practically an 
emperor in fact! 

Of course there are a few drawbacks. I do miss. Mom and 
Dad — and the new babies who were too little to travel — and 
/ do have one cross to bear — namely Clark. It isn*t bad enough 
that he should have a typical small-boy crush {how he would hate 
me for saying that!) on my good and beautiful friend Girdie, 
whom we met on the ship. {Girdie is older than I am, but doesn*t 
make me miserable for it. On the ship, where the other females 
were either Utter Beasts like Mrs. Garcia and Mrs. Royer or 
friendly but ancient grandmas like Mrs. Grew, she was my Best 
Friend.) It isn*t enough that he should be beating the house reg- 
ularly at the Venusburg gambling salons. Worse, he has just 
admitted that he used me to smuggle something aboard ship and 
onto Venus. What did he smuggle, you ask? Oh, nothing serious. 
Just a small {but very lethal) atomic bomb — bribed to do it, 
you see, by a couple of shifty-eyed strangers! 



CONCLUSION 



cause last night out is not only the 
captain’s party, it’s his birthday.’ 
“Now, Sis, you know I wouldn’t 
swallow anything like that. If it had 
really been a birthday present they 
would just have given it to the purser 
to hold. No need to bribe me. So 1 
just played stupid and kept jacking 
up the price. And the idiots paid me. 
They got real jumpy when time 
came to shove us through passport 
clearance and paid all I asked. So I 
shoved it into your bag while you 
were yakking to Uncle Tom — then 



saw to it you didn’t get inspected. 

“Then the minute we were aboard 
I went to get it — and got held up 
by a stewardess spraying your cabin 
and had to do a fast job and go back 
to relock your bag because Uncle 
Tom came back in looking for his 
pipe. That first night I opened the 
thing in the dark — and opened it 
from the bottom; I already had a 
hunch what it might be.” 

“Why?” 

“Sis, use your brain. Don’t just 
sit there and let it rust out. First

they offer me what they probably 
figured was big money to a kid. 
When I turn it down, they start to 
sweat and up the ante. I kept crowd- 
ing it and the money got important. 
And more important. They don’t 
even give me a tale about how a 
man with a flower on his lapel will 
come aboard at Venus and give me 
a pass word. It has to be that they 
don’t care what happens to it as 
long as it gets into the ship. What 
does that add up to? Logic.” 

He added, “So I opened it and 
took it apart. Time bomb. Set for 
three days after we space. Blooey T 
I shivered, thinking about it. 
“What a horrible thing to do!” 

“It could have turned out pretty 
dry,” he admitted, “if I had been as 
stupid as they thought I was.” 

“But why would anybody want to 
do such a thing?” 

“Didn’t want the ship to get to 
Venus.” 

“But whyr 

“You figure it out. I have.” 

“Uh. .what did you do with it?” 
“Oh, I saved it. The essential 
pieces. Never know when you might 
need a bomb.” 

And that’s all 1 got out of him — 
and here 1 am stuck with a Saint 
Podkayne oath not to tell And nine- 
teen questions left unanswered. Was 
there really a bomb? Or was I 
swindled by my brother’s talent for 
improvising explanations that throw 
one off the obvious track? If there 
was, where is it? Still in the Tricorn? 
Right here in this suite? In an in- 
nocent looking package in the safe 



of the Tannhauser? Or parked with 
his private bodyguard, Josie? Or a 
thousand other places in this big 
city? Or is it still more likely that I 
simply made a mistake of three kilo- 
grams in my excitement and that 
Clark was snooping just to be snoop- 
ing? Which he will always do if not 
busy otherwise. 

No way to tell. So I decided to 
squeeze what else I could from this 
Moment of Truth — if it was one. 
“I’m awful glad you found it,” I 
said. “But the slickest thing you ever 
did was that dye job on Mrs. Garcia 
and Mrs. Royer. Girdie admires it, 
too.” 

“She does?” he said eagerly. 

“She certainly does. But I never 
let on you did it. So you can still 
tell Tier yourself, if you want to.” 

“Mmm. .” He looked quite hap- 
py. “I gave Old Lady Royer a little 
extra, just for luck. Put a mouse in 
her bed.” 

“Clark! Oh, wonderful! But where 
did you get a mouse?” 

“Made a deal with the ship’s cat.” 

I wish I had a nice, normal, slight- 
ly stupid family. It would be a lot 
more comfortable. Still, Clark has his 
points. 

B ut I haven’t had too much time 
to worry about my brother’s 
High Crimes and Misdemeanors; 
Venusberg offers too much to divert 
the adolescent female with a hitherto 
unsuspected taste for high living. 
Especially Dexter. 

I am no longer a leper; I can now 
go anywhere, even outside the city, 



82 



IF 




without wearing a filter snout that 
makes me look like a blue-eyed pig 
— and dashing, darling Dexter has 
been most flatteringly eager to es- 
cort me ever5^here. Even shopping. 
Using both hands a girl could spend 
a national debt here on clothes 
alone. But I am being (almost) sen- 
sible and spending only that portion 
of my cash assets earmarked for 
Venus. If I were not Firm with him, 
Dexter would buy me anything I ad- 
mire, just by lifting his finger. (He 
never carries any money, not even 
a credit card, and even his tipping 
is done by some unobvious credit 
system.) But I haven’t let him buy 
me anything more important than a 
fancy ice cream sundae; I have no 
intention of jeopardizing my ama- 
teur status for some pretty clothes. 
But I don’t feel too compromised 
over ice cream and fortunately I do 
not as yet have to worry about my 
waistline — I’m hollow clear to my 
ankles. 

So, after a hard day of sweating 
over the latest Rio styles, Dexter 
takes me to an ice cream parlor — 
one that bears the same relation to 
our Plaza Sweet Shoppe that the 
Tricorn does to a sand car — and he 
sits and toys with cafe au lait and 
watches in amazement while I eat. 
First some little trifle like an ever- 
lasting strawberry soda, then more 
serious work on a “sundae” com- 
posed "by a master architect from 
creams and syrups and imported 
fruits and nuts of course, and per- 
haps a couple of tens of scoops of 
ice cream in various flavors and 



named “The Taj Mahal” or “The 
Big Rock Candy Mountain” or such. 

(Poor Girdie! She diets like a 
Stylite every day of the year. Query: 
Will I ever make that sacrifice to re- 
main svelte and glamorous? Or will 
I get comfortably fat like Mrs. 
Grew? Echo Answereth Not and 
I’m afraid to listen.) 

I’ve had to be firm with him in 
other ways, too, but much less ob- 
viously. Dexter turns out to be a 
master of seductive logic and is ever 
anxious to tell me a bedtime story. 
But I have no intention of being a 
Maid Betrayed, not at my age. The 
tragedy about Romeo and Juliet is 
not that they died so young but that 
the boy-meets-girl reflex should be 
so overpowering as to defeat all 
common sense. 

My own reflexes are fine, thank 
you, and my hormonal balance is 
just dandy. Dexter’s fruitless over- 
tures give me a nice warm feeling at 
the pit of my stomach and hike up 
my metabolism. Perhaps I should 
feel insulted at his dastardly inten- 
tions toward me. And possibly I 
would, at home, but this is Venus- 
berg, where the distinction between 
a shameful proposition and a formal 
proposal of honorable marriage lies 
only in the mind and would strain 
a semantician to define. For all I 
know Dexter already has seven wives 
at home, numbered for the days of 
the week. I haven’t asked him, as I 
have no intention of becoming num- 
ber eight, on any basis. 

I talked this over with Girdie and 
asked why I didn’t feel “insulted.” 

IF 



84 




Had they left the moral circuits out 
of my Cybernet, as they so obviously 
did with my brother Clark? 

Girdie smiled her sweet and secret 
smile that always means she is think- 
ing about something she doesn’t in- 
tend to be fully frank about. Then 
she said, “Poddy, girls are taught to 
be ‘insulted’ at such offers for their 
own protection. It is a good idea, 
quite as good an idea as keeping a 
fire extinguisher handy even though 
you don’t expect a fire. But you are 
right. It is not an insult, it is never 
an insult — it is the one utterly 
honest tribute to a woman’s charm 
and femininity that a man can offer 
her. The rest of what they tell us is 
mostly polite lies. .but on this one 
subject a man is nakedly honest. I 
don’t see any reason ever to be in- 
sulted if a man is polite and gallant 
about it.” 

I thought about it. “Maybe you’re 
right, Girdie. I guess it is a compli- 
ment, in a way. But why is it that 
that is all a boy is ever after? — nine 
times out of ten anyhow.” 

“You’ve got it just backwards. 
Poddy. Why should he ever be after 
anything else? Millions of years of 
evolution is tl;e logic behind every 
proposition. Just be glad that the 
dears have learned to approach the 
matter with hand-kissing instead of 
a club. Some of them, anyhow. It 
gives us more choice in the matter 
than we’ve ever had before in all 
history. It’s a woman’s world today, 
dear. Enjoy it and be grateful.” 

I had never thought of it that way. 
When I’ve thought of it at all, I’ve 



n os O if been groused because it is 
so hard for a girl to break into a 
“male” profession, such as piloting. 

I ’ve been doing some hard think- 
ing about piloting — and have 
concluded that there are more ways 
of skinning a cat than buttering it 
with parsnips. Do I really want to 
be a “famous explorer captain”? Or 
would I be just as happy to be some 
member of his crew? 

Oh, I want to space, let there be 
no doubt about that! My one little 
trip from Mars to Venus makes me 
certain that travel is for me. I’d 
rather be a junior stewardess in the 
Tricorn than President of the Re- 
public. Shipboard life is fun. You 
take your home and your friends 
along with you while you go to ro- 
mantic new places — and with Davis- 
drive star ships being built those 
places are going to be newer and 
more romantic every year. And 
Poddy is going to go, somehow. I 
was born to roam. 

But let’s not kid ourselves, shall 
we? Is anybody going to let Poddy 
captain one of those multimegabuck 
ships? 

Dexter’s chances are a hundred 
times as good as mine. He’s as smart 
as I am, or almost. He’ll have the 
best education for it that money can 
buy. (While I’m loyal to Ares U., I 
know it is a hick college compared 
with where he plans to go. ) And also 
it is quite possible that his Daddy 
could buy him a Star Rover ship. But 
the clincher is that Dexter is twice 
as big as I am and male. Even if you

leave his father’s wealth out of the 
equation, which one of us gets 
picked? 

But all is not lost. Consider Theo- 
dora, consider Catherine the Great. 
Let a man boss the job. .then boss 
that man. I am not opposed to mar- 
riage. (But if Dexter wants to marry 
me — or anything — he’ll have to 
follow me to Marsopolis where we 
are pretty old-fashioned about such 
things. None of this light-hearted 
Venusberg stuff!) Marriage should 
be every woman’s end — but not her 
finish. I do not regard marriage as 
a sort of death. 

Girdie says always to “be what 
you are.” All right, let’s look at our- 
selves in a mirror, dear, and forget 
“Captain Podkayne Fries, the Fa- 
mous Explorer” for the nonce. What 
do we see? 

Getting just a touch broad-shoul- 
dered in the hips, aren’t we, dear? 
No longer any chance of being mis- 
taken for a boy in a dim light. One 
might say that we were designed for 
having babies. And that doesn’t seem, 
too bad an idea, now does it? Espe- 
cially if we could have one as nice 
as Duncan. Fact is, all babies are 
pretty nice even when they’re not. 

Those eighteen miserable hours 
during the storm in the Tricorn, 
changing infants — weren’t they just 
about the most fun you ever had in 
your life? A baby is lots more fun 
than differential equations. 

Every star ship has a creche. So 
which is better? To study creche en- 
gineering and pediatrics — and be a 
department head in a star ship? Or 



buck for pilot training and make it 
. .and wind up as a female pilot no- 
body wants to hire? 

Well, we don’t have to decide 
now — 

I ’m getting pretty anxious for us 
to shape for Earth. Truth is, 
Venusberg’s fleshpots can grow mo- 
notonous to one of my wholesome 
(or should say “limited”) tastes. I 
haven’t any more money for shop- 
ping, not if I am to have any to 
shop in Paris; I don’t think I could 
ever get addicted to gambling (and 
don’t want to; I’m one of those who 
lose and thereby offset in part 
Clark’s winning); and the incessant 
noise and lights are going to put 
wrinkles where I now have dimples. 
And I think Dexter is beginning to 
be just a bit bored with my naive 
inability to understand what he is 
driving at. 

If there is any one thing I have 
learned about males in my eight and 
a half years (Mars years, of course), 
it is that one should sign off before 
he gets bored. I look forward to just 
one last encounter with Dexter now: 
a tearful farewell just before I must 
enter the Tricornes loading tube, 
with a kiss so grown up, so utterly 
passionate and all-out giving, that 
he will believe the rest of his life 
that Things Could Have Been Dif- 
ferent if Only He Had Played His 
Cards Right. 

I’ve been outside the city just 
once, in a sealed tourist bus. Once 
is more than enough. This ball of 
smog and swamp should be given 



86 



IF 




back to the natives, only they 
wouldn’t take it. Once a fairy in 
flight was pointed out, so they said, 
but I didn’t see anything. Just smog. 

I’ll settle now for just one fairy, 
in flight or even perched. Dexter 
says that he knows of a whole colony, 
a thousand or more, less than two 
hundred kilometers away, and wants 
to show it to me in his Rolls. But 
I’m not warm to that idea. He in- 
tends to drive it himself — and that 
dratted thing has automatic controls. 
If I can sneak Girdie, or even Clark, 
into the picnic — well, maybe. 

But I have learned a lot on Venus 
and would not have missed it for 
anything. The Art of Tipping, espe- 
cially, and npw I feel like an Experi- 
enced Traveler. Tipping can be a 
nuisance but it is not quite the vice 
Marsmen think it is. It is a necessary 
lubricant for perfect service. 

Let’s admit it; service in Marsopo- 
lis varies from indifferent to terrible. 
I simply had not realized it. A clerk 
waits on you when he feels like it 
and goes on gossiping with another 
clerk until he does feel like it. 

Not like that in Venusberg! How- 
ever, it is not just the money — and 
here follows the Great Secret of 
Happy Travel. I haven’t soaked up 
much Portuguese and not every- 
body speaks Ortho. But it isn’t neces- 
sary to be a linguist if you will learn 
just one word — in as many lan- 
guages as possible. Just “Thank you.’’ 

I caught onto this first with 
Maria and Maria — 1 say, “Gob- 
PODKAYNE OF MARS 



ble-gobble” to them a hundred times 
a day, only the word is actually 
“Obrigado’’ which sounds like “Gob- 
ble-gobble” if you say it quickly. A 
small tip is much more savoir-fairish 
— and gets better, more willing 
service — when accompanied by 
“Thank you” than a big tip while 
saying nothing. 

So I’ve learned to say “Thank you” 
in as many languages as possible and 
I always try to say it in the home 
language of the person I’m dealing 
with, if I can guess it, which I usually 
can. Doesn’t matter much if you 
miss, though. Porters and clerks and 
taxi drivers and such usually know 
that one word in several languages 
and can spot it even if you can’t talk 
with them at all in any other way. 
I’ve written a lot of them down and 
memorized them: 

Obrigado 

Donkey-Shane 

Mare-see 

Key Toss M’Goy 

Graht-see-eh 

Arigato 

Spawseebaw 

Grathee-oss 

Tock 

Oh “Money Tock” and Clark says 
this one means “Money talks.” But 
Clark is wrong; he has to tip too 
high because he won’t bother to say 
“Thank you.” Oh, yes, Clark tips. It 
hurts him. but he soon discovered 
that he couldn’t get a taxi and that 
even automatic vending machines 
were rude to him if he tried to buck 
the local system But it infuriates 
him so much that he won’t be pleas- 
ant about it and that costs him. 

87 




If you say “Tock” instead of “Key 
Toss” to a Finn, he still understands 
it. If you mistake a Japanese for a 
Cantonese and say “M’goy” instead 
of “Arigato” — well, that is the one 
word of Cantonese he knows. And 
“Obrigado” everybody understands. 

However, if you do guess right 
and pick their home language, they 
roll out the red carpet and genuflect, 
all smiles. I’ve even had tips refused 
— and this in a city where Clark’s 
greediness about money is considered 
only natural. 

AU those other long, long lists of 
hints on How to Get Along While 
Traveling that I studied so carefully 
before I left turn out not to be nec- 
essary. This one rule does it all. 

Uncle Tom is dreadfully worried 
about something. He’s absent- 
minded and, while he will smile at 
me if I manage to get his attention 
“not easy”, the smile soon fades and 
the worry lines show again. Maybe 
it’s something here and things will 
be all right once we leave. I wish we 
were back in the nappy Three- 
Cornered Hat with next stop Luna 
City 

T hings are really grim. Clark 
hasn’t been home for two nights 
and Uncle Tom is almost out of his 
mind. Besides that. I’ve had a quarrel 
with Dexter — which isn’t impor- 
tant compared with Brother being 
missing, but I could surely use a 
shoulder to cry on. 

And Uncle Tom has had a real 
quarrel with Mr. Chairman — which 

88 



was what led to my quarrel with 
Dexter, because I Was on Uncle 
Tom’s side even though I didn’t know 
what was going on and I discovered 
that Dexter was just as blind in his 
loyalty to his father as I am to Uncle 
Tom. I saw only a bit of the quarrel 
with Mr. Chairman. It was one of 
those frightening, cold, bitter, for- 
mally polite, grown-men quarrels of 
the sort that used to lead inevitably 
to pistols at dawn. 

I think it almost did. Mr. Chair- 
man arrived at our suite, looking not 
at all like Santa Claus, and I heard 
Uncle say coldly, “I would rather 
your friends had called on me, sir.” 

But Mr. Chairman ignored that 
and about then Uncle noticed that 
I was there — back of the piano, 
keeping quiet and trying to look 
small — and sent me to my room. 

But I know what part of it is. I 
had thought that both Clark and I 
had been allowed to run around 
loose in Venusberg — although I 
have usually had either Girdie or 
Dexter with me. Not so. Both of us 
have been guarded night and day, 
every instant we have been out of 
the Tannhauser, by Corporation po- 
lice. I never suspected this and I’m 
sure Clark didn’t or he would never 
have hired Josie to watch his boodle. 
But Uncle did know it and had ac- 
cepted it as a courtesy from Mr. 
Chairman, one that left him free to 
do whatever these things are that 
have kept him so busy here, without 
riding herd on two kids, one of them 
nutty as Christmas cake. (And I 
don’t mean me.) 



ir 




As near as I can reconstruct it 
Uncle blames Mr. Chairman for 
Clark’s absence — although this is 
hardly fair, as Clark, if he knew he 
was being watched, could evade 
eighteen private eyes, the entire 
Space Corps and a pack of slavering 
bloodhounds. Or is it wolfhounds? 

But, on top of this, Dexter says 
that they disagree completely on 
how to locate Clark. Myself, I think 
that Clark is missing because Clark 
wants to be missing, because he in- 
tends to miss the ship and stay here 
on Venus where (a) Girdie is and 
where (b) all that lovely money is. 
Although perhaps I have put them 
in the wrong order. 

I keep telling myself this, but Mr. 
Chairman says that it is a kidnap- 
ping, that it has to be a kidnapping 
and that there is only one way to 
handle a kidnapping on Venus if one 
ever expects to see the kidnappee 
alive again. 

On Venus, kidnapping is just about 
the only thing a stockholder is afraid 
of. In fact they are so afraid of it 
that they have brought the thing 
down almost to a ritual. If the kid- 
napper plays by the rules and doesn’t 
hurt his victim, he not only won’t 
be punished but he has the Corpora- 
tion’s assurance that he can keep 
any ransom agreed on. 

But if he doesn’t play by the rules 
and they do catch him, well, it’s 
pretty grisly. Some of the things 
Dexter just hinted at. But I under- 
stand that the mildest punishment 
is something called a “four-hour 
death.” He wouldn’t give me any 



details on this, either — except that 
there is some drug that is just the 
opposite of anesthesia. It makes pain 
hurt worse. 

D exter says that Clark is abso- 
lutely safe — as long as Uncle 
Tom doesn’t insist on meddling with 
things he doesn’t understand. “Old 
fool” is one term that he used, and 
that was when I slapped him. 

Long sigh and a wish for my 
happy girlhood in Marsopolis, where 
I understood how things worked. I 
don’t here. All I really know is that 
I can no longer leave the suite save 
with Uncle Tom — and must leave 
it and stay with him when he does 
and wherever he goes. 

Which is how I at last saw the 
Cunha “cottage” — and would have 
been much interested if Clark hadn’t 
been missing. A modest little place 
only slightly smaller than the Tann- 
hauser, but much more lavish. Our 
President’s Rose House would fit in- 
to its ballroom. That is where I 
quarreled with Dexter while Uncle 
and Mr. Chairman were continuing 
their worse quarrel elsewhere in that 
“cottage.” 

Presently Uncle Tom took me 
back to the Tannhauser and I’ve 
never seen him look so old — fifty 
at least, or call it a hundred and fifty 
of the years they use here. We had 
dinner in the suite and neither of us 
ate anything and after dinner I went 
over and sat by the living window. 
The view was from Earth, I guess. 
The Grand Canyon of El Dorado, 
or El Colorado, or whatever it is.

Grand, certainly. But all I got was 
acrophobia and tears. 

Uncle was just sitting, looking like 
Prometheus enduring the eagles. I 
put my hand in his and said, “Uncle 
Tom? I wish you would spank me.” 
“Eh?” He shook his head and 
seemed to see me. “Flicka! Why?” 
“Because it’s my fault.” 

“What do you mean, dear?” 
“Because I’m responsibu- bul for 
Clark. I always have been. He hasn’t 
any sense. Why, when he was a baby 
I must have kept him from falling in 
the Canal at least a thousand times.” 
He shook his head, negatively this 
time. “No, Poddy, It is my responsi- 
bility and not yours at all. I am in 
loco parentis to both of you. Which 
means that your parents were loco 
ever to trust me with it.” 

“But I feel responsible. He’s my 
Chinese obligation.” 

He shook his head still again. “No. 
In sober truth no person can ever be 
truly responsible for another human 
being. Each one of us faces up to 
the universe alone — and the uni- 
verse is what it is and it doesn’t 
soften the rules for any of us. .and 
eventually, in the long run, the uni- 
verse always wins and takes all. But 
that doesn’t make it any easier when 
we try to be responsible for another 
— as you have — as I have — and 
then look back and see how we 
could have done it better.” He sighed. 
“I should not have blamed Mr. Cun- 
ha. He tried to take care of Clark, 
too. Of both of you. 1 knew it.” 
He paused and added, “It was just 
that 1 had a foul suspicion, an un- 

90 



worthy one, that he was using Clark 
to bring pressure on me. I was 
wrong. In his way and by his rules, 
Mr. Cunha is an honorable man. 
His rules do not include using a boy 
for political purposes.” 

U ncle looked around at me, as 
if surprised that I was still in the 
room. “Poddy, I should have told 
you more than I have. I keep for- 
getting that you are now a woman. 
I always think of you as the baby 
who used to climb on my knee and 
ask me to tell her ‘The Poddy 
Story.’ ” He took a deep breath. “I 
still won’t burden you with all of it. 
But I owe Mr. Cunha an abject apol- 
ogy — because I was using Clark for 
political purposes. And you, too.” 
“Huh?” 

“As a cover-up, dear. Doddering 
great uncle escorts beloved niece and 
nephew on pleasure tour. I’m sorry. 
Poddy, but it isn’t that way at all. 
The truth is I am Ambassador Ex- 
traordinary and Minister Plenipo- 
tentiary for the Republic. To the 
Three Planets Summit. But it 
seemed desirable to keep it a secret 
until I present my credentials.” 

I didn’t answer beause I was hav- 
ing a little trouble soaking this in. I 
mean, 1 know Uncle Tom is pretty 
special and has done some important 
things But all my life he has been 
somebody who always had time to 
hold a skein of yarn for me while I 
wound it and would take serious in- 
terest in helping me name paper 
dolls. 

But he was talking. “So I used 

IF 




you, Flicka. You and your brother. 
Because — Poddy, do you really 
want to know all the ins and outs 
and snarls of the politics behind 
this?” 

I did very much. But I tried to 
be grown up. “Just whatever you 
think best to tell me, Uncle Tom.” 

“All right. Because some of it is 
sordid and all of it is complex and 
would take hours to explain. And 
some of it really isn’t mine to tell; 
some of it involves Bozo — Sorry, the 
President. Some of it has to do with 
promises he made. Do you know 
who our Ambassador is, now, at 
Luna City?” 

I tried to remember. “Mr. Sus- 
lov?” 

“No, that was last administra- 
tion. Artie Finnegan. Artie isn’t 
too bad a boy, but he thinks he 
should have been President and he’s 
certain he knows more about in- 
terplanetary affairs and what is 
good for Mars than the President 
does. Means well, no doubt.” 

1 didn’t comment because the 
name “Arthur Finnegan” I recog- 
nized at once — because I had once 
heard Uncle Tom sound off about 
him to Daddy when I was supposed 
to be in bed and asleep. Some of 
the milder expressions were “a head 
like a sack of mud,” “larceny in 
his heart” and a “size twelve ego 
in a size nine soul.” 

“But even though he means well,” 
Uncle Tom went on. “he doesn’t see 
eye to eye with the President — and 
myself — on matters that will come 
before this conference. But, unless 



the President sends a special envoy 
— me, in this case — ^the Ambassa- 
dor in residence automatically speaks 
for Mars. Poddy, what do you 
know about Switzerland?” 

“Huh? William Tell. The apple.” 
“That’s enough, I guess, although 
there probably never was an apple. 
Poddy, Mars is the Switeerland of 
the Solar System — or it isn’t any- 
thing at all. So the President thinks, 
and so I think. A small man (and 
a small country, like Mars or Swit- 
zerland) can stand up to bigger, 
powerful neighbors only by being 
willing to fight. We’ve never had a 
war and I pray we never do, because 
we would probably lose it. But if we 
are willing enough, we may never 
have to fight.” 

H e sighed. “That’s the way I see 
it. But Mr. Finnegan thinks 
that because Mars is small and weak 
Mars should join up with the Ter- 
ran Federation. Perhaps he’s right 
and this really is the wave of the 
future. But I don’t think so. I think 
it would be the end of Mars as an 
independent country and a free so- 
ciety. Furthermore, I think it is logi- 
cal that, if Mars gives up its inde- 
pendence, it is only a matter of time 
until Venus goes the same way. I’ve 
been spending the time since we got 
here trying to convince Mr. Cunha 
of this, cause him to have his Res- 
ident Commissioner make a com- 
mon cause with us against Terra. 
This could persuade Luna to come 
in with us, too, since both Venus 
and Mars can sell to Luna cheaper 



PODKAYNE OF AAARS 



91 




than Terra can. But it wasn’t at all 
easy; the Corporation has such a 
long-standing policy of never med- 
dling in politics at all. ‘Put not your 
faith in princes’ — which means to 
them that they buy and they seD 
and they ask no questions. 

“But I have been trying to make 
Mr. Cunha see that if Luna and 
Mars and Terra — the Jovian moons 
hardly count — if those three were 
all under the same rules, in short 
order Venus Corporation would be 
no more free than is General Motors 
or I.G. Farbenindustrie. He got the 
picture, too, I’m sure — until I 
jumped to conclusions about Clark’s 
disappearance and blew my top at 
him.” He shook his head. “Poddy, 
I’m a poor excuse for a diplomat.” 

“You aren’t the only one who got* 
sore,” I said, and told him about 
slapping Dexter. 

He smiled for the first time. “Oh, 
Poddy, Poddy, we’ll never make a 
lady out of you. You’re as bad as 
m. 

So 1 grinned back at him and 
started picking my teeth with a fin- 
gernail. This is an even ruder gesture 
than you might think — and utterly 
private between Uncle Tom and my- 
self. We Maori have a very blood- 
thirsty history and I won’t even hint 
at what it is we are supposed to be 
picking out of our teeth. Uncle Tom 
used to use this vulgar pantomime 
on mer when I was a little girl, to 
tell me I wasn’t being ladylike. 

Whereupon he really smiled and 
mussed my hair. “You’re the blond- 
est, blue-eyed savage I ever saw. But 



you’re a savage, all right. And me, 
too. Better tell him you’re sorry, 
hon, because, much as I appreciate 
your gallant defense of me, Dexter 
was perfectly right. I was an ‘old 
fool.’ I’ll apologize to his father, do- 
ing the last hundred meters on my 
belly if he wants it that way. A man 
should admit it in full when he’s 
wrong and make amends. And you 
kiss and make up with Dexter. Dex- 
ter is a fine boy.” 

“I’ll say I’m sorry and .make up 
— but I don’t think I’ll kiss him. I 
haven’t yet.” 

He looked surprised. “So? Don’t 
you like him? Or have we brought 
too much Norse blood into the 
family?” 

“I like Dexter just fine and you’re 
crazy with the smog if you think 
Svenska blood is any colder than 
Polynesian. I could go for Dexter 
in a big way — and that’s why I 
haven’t kissed him.” 

H e considered this. “I think 
you’re wise, hon. Better do your 
practice kisses on boys who don’t 
tend to cause your gauges to swing 
over into the red. Anyhow, although 
he’s a good lad, he’s not nearly good 
enough for my savage niece.” 
“Maybe so, maybe not. Uncle. 
what are you going to do about 
Clark?” 

His halfway happy mood vanish- 
ed. “Nothing. Nothing at all.” 

“But we’ve got to do something!” 
“But what, Podkayne?” 

There he had me. I had already 
chased it through all the upper and 



92 





lower segments of my brain. Tell 
the police? Mr. Chairman is the po- 
lice — they all work for him. Hire 
a private detective? If Venus has any 
(I don’t know), then they all are un- 
der contract to Mr. Cunha, or rath- 
er, the Venus Corporation. 

Run ads in newspapers? Question 
all the taxi drivers? Put Clark’s pic- 
ture in the sollies and offer rewards? 
It didn’t matter what you thought of, 
everything on Venus belongs to Mr. 
Chairman. Or, rather, to the corpo- 
ration he heads. Same thing, really, 
although Uncle Tom tells me that 
the Cunha§ actually own only a frac- 
tion of the stock. 

“Poddy, I’ve been over every- 
thing I could think of with Mr. Cun- 
ha — and he is either already doing it, 
or he has convinced me that here, 
under conditions he knows much bet- 
ter than I do, it should not be done.” 

“Then what do we do?** 

“We wait. But if you think of 
anything — anything — that you 



think might help, tell me and if it 
isn’t already being done, we’ll call 
Mr. Cunha and find out if it should 
be done. If I’m asleep, wake me.” 
“I will.” I doubted if he would be 
asleep. Or me. But something else 
had been bothering me. “Jf time 
corns for the Tricorn to shape for 
Earth — and Clark jsh’t back — 
what do you do then?” 

He didn’t answer; the lines in his 
face just got deeper. I knew what 
the Awful Decision was — and I 
knew how he had decided it. 

But I had a little Awful Decision 
of my own to make. .and I had 
talked to Saint Podkayne about it 
for quite a while and had decided 
that Poddy had to break a Saint- 
Podkayne oath. Maybe this sounds 
silly but it isn’t silly to me. Never in 
my life had I broken one. .and 
never in my life will I be utterly 
sure about Poddy again. 

So I told Uncle all about the 
smuggled bomb. 

Somewhat to my surprise he took 
it seriously — when I had about per- 
suaded myself that Clark had been 
pulling my leg just for exercise. 
Smuggling — oh, sure, I understand 
that every ship in space has smug- 
gling. But not a bomb. Just some- 
thing valuable enough that it was 
worthwhile to bribe a boy to get it 
aboard, .and probably Clark had 
been paid off again when he passed 
it along — 

B ut Uncle wanted me to describe 
exactly the person I had seen 
talking to Clark at Deimos Station. 



PODKAYNE OF A^RS 



93 



“Uncle, I can’t! I barely glanced 
at him. A man. Not short, not tall, 
not especially fat or skinny, not 
dressed in any way that made me 
remember. I’m not sure I looked at 
his face at all. Uh, yes, I did but I 
can’t call up any picture of it.’’ 

“Could it have been one of the 
passengers?” 

I thought hard about that. “No. 
Or I would have noticed his face 
later when it was still fresh in my 
mind. Mmm. .I’m almost certain he 
didn’t queue up with us. I think he 
headed for the exit, the one that 
takes you back to the shuttle ship.” 

“That is likely,” he agreed. “Cer- 
tain — if it was a bomb. And not 
just a product of Clark’s remarkable 
imagination.” 

“But, Uncle Tom, why would it 
be a bomb?” 

And he didn’t answer and 1 al- 
ready knew why. Why would any- 
body blow up the Tricorn and kill 
everybody in her, babies and all? 
Not for insurance like you some- 
times find in adventure stories; 
Lloyd’s won’t insure a ship for 
enough to show a profit on that sort 
of crazy stunt — or at least that’s 
the way it was explained to me in 
my high school economics class. 

Why, then? 

To keep the ship from getting to 
Venus. 

But the T ricorn had been to Venus 
tens and tens of times. 

To keep somebody in the ship 
from getting to Venus (or perhaps 
to Luna) that trip. 

Who? Not Podkayne Fries. 1 



wasn’t important to anybody but me. 

For the nett couple of hours Uncle 
Tom and I searched that hilton suite. 
We didn’t find anything, nor did I 
expect us to. If there was a bomb 
(which I still didn’t fully believe) 
and if Clark had indeed brought it 
off the ship and hidden it there 
(which seemed unlikely, with all of 
the Tricorn at one end and all of 
the city at the other end to choose 
from), nevertheless he had had days 
and days in which to make it look 
like anything from a vase of flowers 
to a — an anything. 

We searched Clark’s room last on 
the theory that it was the least likely 
place. Or, rather, we started to 
search it together and Uncle had to 
finish it. Pawing through Clark’s 
things got to be too much for me and 
Uncle sent me back into the salon 
to lie down. 

I was all cried out by the time 
he gave up. I even had a sugges- 
tion to make. “Maybe if we sent for 
a Geiger counter?” 

Uncle shook his head and sat 
down. “We aren’t looking for a 
bomb, honey.” 

“We aren’t?” 

“No. If we found it, it would 
simply confirm that Clark had told 
you the truth, and I’m already using 
that as least hypothesis. Because — 
Well, because I know more about 
this than the short outline 1 gave 
to you. .and I know just how deadly 
serious this is to some people, how 
far they might go. Politics is neither 
a game nor a bad joke the way some 



94 



IF 




people think it is. War itself is mere- 
ly an extension of politics. .so I 
don’t find anything surprising about 
a bomb in politics. Bombs have been 
used in politics hundreds and even 
thousands of times in the past. No, 
we aren’t looking for a bomb, we 
are looking for a man — a man you 
saw for a few seconds once. And 
probably not even for that man but 
for somebody that man might lead 
us back to. Probably somebody in- 
side the President’s office, somebody 
he trusts.” 

“Oh, gosh, I wish I had really 
looked at him!” 

“Don’t fret about it, hon. You 
didn’t know and there was no reason 
to look. But you can bet that Clark 
knows what he looks like. If Clark 
— I mean, when Clark comes back, 
in time we will have him search the 
I.D. files at Marsopolis. And all the 
visa photographs for the past ten 
years, if necessary. The man will be 
found. And through him the person 
the President has been trusting who 
should not be trusted.” Uncle Tom 
suddenly looked all Maori and very 
savage. “And when we do, I may 
take care of it personally.” 

Then he smiled and added, “But 
right now Poddy is going to bed. 
You’re up way past your bedtime, 
even with all the dancing and late- 
sleeping you’ve been doing lately.” 

“Uh. .what time is it in Marsopo- 
lis?” 

He looked at his other watch. 
“Twenty-seventeen. You weren’t 
thinking of phoning your parents? 
I hope not.” 



“Oh, nol I won’t say a word to 
them unless — until Clark is back. 
And maybe not then. But if it’s only 
twenty-seventeen, it’s not late at all, 
real time, and I don’t want to go to 
bed. Not until you do.” 

“I may not go to bed.” 

“I don’t care. I want to sit with 
you.” 

He blinked at me, then said very 
gently. “All right. Poddy. Nobody 
ever grows up without spending at 
least one night of years.” 

We just sat then for quite a while, 
with nothing to say that had not 
already been said and would just 
hurt to say over again. 

At last 1 said, “UnkaTom? Tell 
me the Poddy Story.” 

“At your age?” 

“Please.” 1 crawled up on his 
knees. “1 want to sit in your lap 
once more and hear it. I need to.” 
“All right,” he said, and put his 
arm around me. “ ‘Once upon a time, 
long, long ago when the world was 
young, in a specially favored city 
there lived a little girl named Poddy. 
All day long she was busy like a 
ticking clock. Tick tick tick went her 
heels, tick tick tick went her knitting 
needles, and, most especially, tick 
tick tick went her busy little mind. 
Her hair was the color of butter 
blossoms in the spring when the ice 
leaves the canals, her eyes were the 
changing blue of sunshine playing 
down through the spring floods, her 
nose had not yet made up its mind 
what it would be, and her mouth 
was shaped like a question mark. 
She greeted the world as an un- 



PODKAYNE OF MARS

opened present and there was no 
l^dness in her anywhere. 

‘“One day Poddy — 

I stopped him. “But Fm not young 
any longer. .and I don’t think the 
world was every young!” 

“Here’s my hanky,” he said. 
“Blow your nose. I never did tell 
you the end of it, Poddy; you always 
fell asleep. It ends with a miracle.” 
“A truly miracle?” 

“Yes. This is the end. Poddy grew 
up and had another Poddy. And 
then the world was young again.” 

“Is that all?” 

“That’s all there ever is. But it’s 
enough.” 

1 guess Uncle Tom put me to 
bed, for I woke up with just my 
shoes off and very rumpled. He was 
gone but he had left a note saying 
that 1 could reach him, if I needed 
to, on Mr. Chairman’s private code. 
I didn’t have any excuse to bother 
him and didn’t want to face anyone, 
so I chased Maria and Maria out 
and ate breakfast in bed. Ate quite 
a lot, too, I must admit. The body 
goes on ticking anyhow. 

Then I dug out my journal for the 
first time since landing. I don’t mean 
I haven’t been keeping it; I mean 
I’ve been talking it instead of writing 
it. The libra^ in our suite has a 
recorder built into its desk and I 
discovered how easy it was to keep 
a diary that way. Well, I had really 
found out before that, because Mr. 
Clancy let me use the recorder they 
use to keep th'^ log on. 

The onlv - -ortcoming of the re- 



corder in the library was that Clark 
might drop in most any time. But 
the first day I went shopping I found 
the most darling little minirecorder 
at Venus Macy — only ten-fifty and 
it just fits in the palm of your hand; 
you can talk into it without even 
being noticed if you want to and I 
just couldn’t resist it. I’ve been carry- 
ing it in my purse ever since. 

But now I wanted to look way 
back in my journal, the early written 
part, and see if I had anything 
that might remind me of what That 
Man had looked like. 

I hadn’t. No clues. But I FOUND 
A NOTE FROM CLARK. 

It read: 

Pod, 

If you find this at all, it’s time 
you read it. Because I’m using 24-hr 
ink and 1 expect to lift this out of 
here and you’ll never see it. 

Girdie is in trouble and I’m going 
to rescue her. I haven’t told anybody 
because this is one job that is all 
mine and I don’t want you or any- 
body horning in on it. 

However, a smart gambler hedges 
his bets, if he can. If I’m gone long 
enough for you to read this, it’s time 
to get hold of Uncle Tom and have 
him get hold of Chairman Cunha. 
All I can tell you is that there is a 
news stand right at South Gate. You 
buy a copy of the Daily Merchant 
diser and ask if they carry Everlites. 
Then you say, “Better give me two 
— it’s quite dark where I’m going.” 

But don’t you do this, I don’t want 
it muffed up.

Clark 

I got all blurry. That last line — 
I know a holographic last will and 
testament when I see one, even 
though I had never seen one before. 
Then I straightened up and counted 
ten seconds backwards including the 
rude word at the end that discharges 
nervous tension, for I knew this was 
no time to be blurry and weak. 

So I called Uncle Tom right away, 
as I agreed perfectly with Clark on 
one point: I wasn’t going to try to 
emulate Space Ranger Stalwart, 
Man of Steel, the way Clark evident- 
ly had. I was going to get all the 
help I could getl With both Clark 
and Girdie in some sort of pinch I 
would have welcomed two regiments 
of Patrol Marines and the entire 
Martian Legion. 

So I called Mr. Chairman’s priv- 
ate code — and it didn’t answer; it 
simply referred me to another code. 
This one answered all right, . .but 
with a recording. Uncle Tom. And 
this time all he said was to repeat 
something he had said in the note, 
that he expected to be busy all day 
and that I was not to leave the suite 
under any circumstances whatever 
until he got back. Only this time he 
added that I was not to let anyone 
into the suite, either, not even a re- 
pairman, not even a servant except 
those who were already there, like 
Maria and Maria. 



W hen the recording started to 
play back for the third time, 
I switched off. Then I called Mr. 
Chairman the public way, through 
the Corporation offices. A dry deal 
that was! By pointing out that I was 
Miss Fries, niece of Senator Fries, 
Mars Republic, I did get as far as 
his secretary, or maybe his secre- 
tary’s secretary. 

“Mr. Cunha cannot be reached. 
I am veree soiree. Miss Fries.” 

So I demanded that she locate 
Uncle Tom. “I do not have that in- 
formation. I am veree soiree. Miss 
Fries.” 

Then I demanded to be patched 
in to Dexter. “Mr. Dexter is on an 
inspection trip for Mr. Cunha. I am 
veree soiree.” 

She either couldn’t, or wouldn’t, 
tell me when Dexter was expected 
back — and wouldn’t, or couldn’t, 
find some way for me to call him. 
Which I just plain didn’t believe, be- 
cause if I owned a planetwide cor- 
poration there would be some way 
to phone every mine, every ranch, 
every factory, every air boat the 
company owned. All the time. And 
I don’t even suspect that Mr. Chair- 
man is less smart about how to run 
such a lash-up than I am. 

I told her so, using the colorful 
rhetoric of sand rats and canal men. 
I mean I really got mad and used 
idioms I hadn’t known I even re- 
membered. I guess Uncle is right. 
Scratch my Nordic skin and a savage 
is just underneath. I wanted to pick 
my teeth at her, only she wouldn’t 
have understood it 



PODKAYNE OF A^RS 




But would you believe it? I might 
as well have been cussing out a sand 
gator; it had net affect on her at all. 
She just repeated, “I’m-veree-sorree- 
Miss-Fries,” and I hung up. 

Do you suppose *Mr. Chairman 
uses an androidal Tik-Tok as his 
phone monitor? I wouldn’t put it 
past him. Any live woman should 
have shown some reaction at the 
some of the implausibilities 1 show- 
ered on her, even if she didn’t under- 
stand most of the words. (Well, I 
don’t understand some of them my- 
self. But they are not compliments.) 

I thought about phoning Daddy. 
1 knew he would accept the charges, 
even if he had to mortgage his 
salary. But Mars was eleven minutes 
away; it said so, right on a dial of 
the phone. And the relays via 



Hermes Station and Luna City were 
even worse. With twenty-two min- 
utes between each remark it would 
take me most of the day just to tell 
him what was wrong, even though 
they don’t charge you for the wait- 
ing time. 

But I still might have called ex- 
cept — well, what could Daddy do, 
three hundred million kilometers 
away? All it would do would be to 
turn his last six hairs white. 

It wasn’t until then that I steadied 
down enough to realize that there 
had been something else amiss about 
that note written into my journal — 
besides Clark’s childish swashbuck- 
ling. 

Girdie! 

It was true that I had not seen 
Girdie for a couple of days; she was 




on a shift that caused her to zig 
while I zagged. Newly hired dealers 
don’t get the best shifts. But I had 
indeed talked to her at a time when 
Clark was probably already gone 
even though at the time I had simply 
assumed that he had gotten up early 
for some inscrutable reason of his 
own, rather than not coming home 
at all that night. 

But Uncle Tom had talked to her 
just before we had gone to the Cun- 
ha cottage the day before, asked 
her specifically if she had seen Clark 
— and she hadn’t. Not as recently 
as we had. 

So she wasn’t missing. 

So it was Clark — 

I didn’t have any trouble reach- 
ing Dom Pedro — not the Dom 



Pedro I met the night I met Dexter 
but the Dom Pedro of that shift. 
However, by now all the Dom Ped- 
ros know who Poddy Fries is; she’s 
the girl that is seen with Mr. Dexter. 
He told me at once that Girdie had 
gone off shift half an hour earlier 
and I should try her hilton. Unless 
— he stopped and made some in- 
quiries; somebody seemed to think 
that Girdie had gone shopping. 

As may be. 1 already knew that 
she was not at the little hilton she 
had moved to from the stylish (and 
expensive) Tannhauser. A message 
I had already recorded there was 
guaranteed to fetch a call back in 
seconds, if and when. 

That ended it. There was no one 
left for me to turn to, nothing at all 
left for me to do, save wait in the

suite until Uncle returned, as he had 
ordered me to do. 

So I grabbed my purse and a 
coat and left. 

And got all of three meters out- 
side the door of the suite. A tall, 
wide, muscular character got in my 
way. When I tried to duck around 
him, he said, “Now, now. Miss Fries. 
Your uncle left orders.” 

I scurried the other way and fonnd 
that he was awfully quick on his 
feet, for such a big man. So there 
I was, arrested! Shoved back into our 
own suite and held in durance vile. 
You know, I don’t think Uncle en- 
tirely trusts me. 

I went back to my room and 
closed the door and thought about 
it. The room was still not made up 
and still cluttered with dirty dishes 
because, despite the language bar- 
rier, I have made clear to Maria 
and Maria that Miss Fries becomes 
quite vexed if anybody disturbs my 
room until I signal that I no longer 
want privacy by leaving the door 
open. 

The clumsy, two-decker, roU- 
around table that had fetched my 
breakfast was still by my bed, look- 
ing like a plundered city. 

I took everything off the lower 
shelf, stowed it here and there in 
my bath, covered the stuff on top of 
the table with the extra cloth used 
to shield the tender eyes of cash 
customers from the sight of dirty 
dishes. 

Then 1 grabbed the house phone 
and told them I wanted my break- 
fast dishes cleared away fast

I’m not very big. I mean, you can 
fit forty-nine mass kilos only one 
hundred fifty-seven centimeters long 
into a fairly small space if you 
scrunch a litde. That lower shelf was 
hard but not too cramped. It had 
some ketchup on it I hadn’t noticed. 

Uncle’s orders (or perhaps Mr. 
Cunha’s) were being followed me- 
ticulously, however. Ordinarily a 
pantry boy comes to remove the 
food wagon; this time the two Marias 
took it out the service entrance and 
as far as the service lift. In the 
course of it I learned something in- 
teresting but not really surprising. 
Maria said something in Portuguese; 
the other Maria answered her in 
Ortho as glib as mine: “She’s prob- 
ably soaking in the tub, the lazy 
brat.” 

I made a note not to remember 
her on birthdays and at Christmas. 

Somebody wheeled me off the lift 
many levels down and shoved me 
into a corner. I waited a few mo- 
ments, then crawled out. A man in 
a well-spotted apron was looking 
astonished. I said, “Obrigado!” 
handed him a deuce note and walked 
out the service entrance with my 
nose in the air. Two minutes later I 
was in a taxi. 

I’ve been catching up on this ac- 
count while the taxi scoots to South 
Gate in order not to chew my nails 
back to the elbows. I must admit 
that I feel good even though nerv- 
ous. Action is better than waiting. 
No amount of bad can stonker me 
but not knowing drives me nuts. 

This spool is almost finished, so 

IF 




I think ril change spools and mail 
this one back to Uncle at South 
Gate. I should have left a note, I 
know — but this is better than a 
note. I hope.

W ell, I can’t complain about not 
having seen fairies. They are 
every bit as cute as they are supposed 
to be — but I don’t care greatly if I 
never see another one. 

Throwing myself bravely into the 
fray against fearful odds, by sheer 
audacity I overcame — 

It wasn’t that way at all. I fubbed. 
Completely. So here I am, some no- 
where place out in the bush, in a 
room with no windows and only one 
door. 

That door isn’t much use to me, 
as there is a fairy perched over it. 
She’s a cute little thing and the green 
part of her fur looks exactly like a 
ballet tutu. She doesn’t look quite 
like a miniature human with wings. 
But they do say that the longer you 
stay here the more human they look. 
Her eyes slant up, like a cat, and she 
has a very pretty built-in smile. 

I call her “Titania” because I can’t 
pronounce her real name. She speaks 
a few words of Ortho, not much, 
because those little skulls are only 
about twice the brain capacity of a 
cat’s skull. Actually she’s an idiot 
studying to be a moron and not 
studying very hard. 

Most of the time she just stays 
perched and nurses her baby — the 
size of a kitten and twice as cute. 



I call it “Ariel” although I’m not 
sure of its sex. I’m not dead sure of 
Titania’s sex. They say that both 
males and females do this nursing 
thing, which is not quite nursing but 
serves the same purpose; they are 
not mammalians. Ariel hasn’t learn- 
ed to fly yet, but Titania is teaching 
it — tosses it into the air and it sort 
of flops and glides to the floor and 
then stays there, mewing piteously 
until she comes to get it and flies 
back to her perch. 

I’m spending most of my time (a) 
thinking, (b) bringing this journal 
up to date, (c) trying to persuade 
Titania to let me hold Ariel (making 
some progress; she now lets me pick 
it up and hand it to her — the baby 
isn’t a bit afraid of me) and (d) 
thinking which seems to be a futile 
occupation. 

Because I can go anywhere in the 
room and do anything as long as I 
stay a couple of meters away from 
that door. Gue^s why? Give up? Be- 
cause fairies have very sharp teeth 
and claws; they’re carnivorous. I 
have a nasty bite and two deep 
scratches on my left arm to prove 
it — red and tender and don’t seem 
to want to heal. If I get close to 
that door, she dives on me. 

Completely friendly otherwise. 
Nor do I have anything physically 
to complain about. Often enough a 
native comes in with a tray of really 
quite good food. But I never watch 
him come in and I never watch him 
take it away — because Venusians 
look entirely too human to start 
with and the more you look at them 



PODKAYNE OF AAARS

the worse it is for your stomach. No 
doubt you have seen pictures but 
pictures don’t give you the smell and 
that drooling loose mouth, nor the 
impression that this thing has been 
dead a long time and is now ani- 
mated by obscene arts. 

I call him “Pinhead” and to him 
that is a compliment. No doubt as to 
its being a “him” either. It’s enough 
to make a girl enter a nunnery. 

I eat the food because I feel sure 
Pinhead didn’t cook it. I think I 
know who does. She would be a good 
cook. 

L et me back up a little. I told 
the news vendor: “Better give 
me two — it’s quite dark where I’m 
going.” He hesitated and looked at 
me and I repeated it. 

So pretty soon I am in another air 
car and headed out over the bush. 
Ever make a wide, sweeping turn in 
smog? That did it. I haven’t the 
slightest idea where I am, save that 
it is somewhere within two hours 
flight of Venusberg and that there 
is a small colony of fairies near. by. 1 
saw them flying shortly before we 
landed and was so terribly interested 
that 1 didn’t really get a good look 
at the spot before the car stopped 
and the door opened. 

Not that It would have done any 
good. 

1 got out and the car lifted at 
once, trussing me up with its fan , . 
and here was an open door to a 
house and a tamiliar voice was say- 
ing, “Poddy! Come in, dear, come 
ini” 



And I was suddenly so relieved 
that I threw myself into her arms 
and hugged her and she hugged me 
back. It was Mrs. Grew, fat and 
friendly as ever. 

And looked around and here was 
Clark, just sitting — and he looked 
at me and said, “Stupid,” and looked 
away. And then I saw Uncle sitting 
in another chair and was about to 
throw myself at him with wild shouts 
of glee — when Mrs. Grew’s arms 
were suddenly awfully strong and 
she said soothingly, “No, no, dear, 
not quite so fast,” and held me until 
somebody (Pinhead, it was) did 
something to the back of my neck. 

Then I had a big comfortable 
chair all to myself and didn’t want it 
because I couldn’t move from my 
neck down. I felt all right, aside 
from some odd tingles, but I couldn’t 
stir. 

Uncle looked like Mr. Lincoln 
grieving over the deaths at Water- 
loo. He didn’t say anything. 

Mrs. Grew said cheerfully, “Well, 
now we’ve got the whole family to- 
gether, Feel a bit more like discuss- 
ing things rationally. Senator?” 

Uncle shook his head a half a 
centimeter. 

She said, “Oh, come now! We do 
want you to attend the conference. 
We simply want you to attend it in 
the right frame of mind. If we can’t 
agree — well, it’s hardly possible to 
let any of you be found again. Isn’t 
that obvious? And that would be 
such a shame. Especially for the chil- 
dren.” 

Uncle said, “Pass the nemlock.”

IF 




“Oh, Fm sure you don’t mean 
that.” 

“He certainly does mean it!” 
Clark said shrilly. “You illegal ob- 
scenity! I delete all over your cen- 
sored!” — and I knew he was really 
worked up, because Clark is con- 
temptuous of vulgar idioms; he says 
they denote an inferior mind. 

Mrs. Grew looked at Clark plac- 
idly, even tenderly. Then she called 
in Pinhead again. “Take him out and 
keep him awake till he dies.” Pin- 
head picked Clark up and carried 
him out. But Clark had the last word. 
“And besides that,” he yelled, “yoM 
cheat at solitaire! Fve watched you!” 

F or a split second Mrs. Grew 
looked really annoyed. Then she 
put her face back into its usual kind- 
ly expression and said to Uncle, 
“Now that I have both of the kids 
I think I can afford to expend one 
of them. Especially as you are quite 
fond of Poddy. Too fond of her, 
some people would say. Psychia- 
trists, I mean.” 

I mulled that over . and decided 
that if I ever got out of this mess, I 
would make a rug out of her hide 
and give it to Uncle. 

Uncle ignored it. Presently there 
was a most dreadful racket, metal 
on resounding metal. Mrs. Grew 
smiled. “It’s crude but it works. It is 
what use»i to be a water heater when 
this was a ranch. Unfortunately it 
isn’t quite big enough either to sit 
down or stand up in — but a boy 
that rude really shouldn’t expect 
comfort. The noise comes from 
pounding on the outside of it 



with a club.” She smiled and then 
looked thoughtful. “I don’t see how 
we can talk things over with such a 
racket going on. I think I should 
have the tank moved farther away. 
Or perhaps our talk would march 
even more quickly if I had it brought 
nearer, so that you could hear the 
sounds he makes inside the tank, too. 
What do you think. Senator?” 

I cut in. “Mrs. Grew!” 

“Yes, dear? Poddy, I’m sorry but 
I’m really quite busy. Later we’ll 
have a nice cup of tea together. 
Now, Senator — ” 

“Mrs. Grew, you don’t understand 
my Uncle Tom at all! You’ll never 
get anything out of him this way.” 
She considered it. “I think you ex- 
aggerate, dear. Wishful thinking.” 
“No, no, no! There isn’t any way 
you could possibly get my Uncle 
Tom to do anything against Mars. 
But if you hurt Clark — or me 
— you’ll just make him more ada- 
mant. Oh, he loves me and he loves 
Clark, too. But if you try to budge 
him by hurting either one of us, 
you’re just wasting your time!” I was 
talking rapidly and just as sincerely 
as I know how. I seemed to hear 
Clark’s screams. Not likely, I guess, 
not over that infernal clanging. But 
once when he was a baby he fell in- 
to a wastebasket . and screamed 
something dreadful before I rescued 
him. I was hearing that again. 

Mrs. Grew smiled pleasantly. 
“Poddy dear, you are only a girl and 
your head has been filled with non- 
sense. The Senator is going to do just 
what I want him to do.”

“Not if you kill Clark, he won’t!’* 
“You keep quiet, dear. Do keep 
quiet and let me explain, or I shall 
have to slap you a few times to keep 
you quiet. Poddy, I am not going to 
kill your brother.” 

“But you said — ” 

** Quiet! That native who took your 
brother away didn’t understand what 
I said. He knows only trade Ortho, 
a few words, never a full sentence 
I said what I did for the benefit of 
your brother. .so that, when I do 
have him fetched back in, he’ll be 
grovelling, begging your uncle to do 
anything I want him to do.” 

S hq smiled warmly. “One piece of 
nonsense you’ve apparently been 
taught is that patriotism, or some- 
thing silly like that, will overpower a 
man’s own self interest. Believe me, 
I have no slightest fear that an old 
political hack like your uncle wiU 
give any real weight to such a silly 
abstraction. What does worry him 
is his own political ruin if he does 
what 1 want him to do What he is 
going to do. Eh, Senator?” 

“Madam,” Uncle Tom answered 
tightly, “I see no point in bandying 
words with you.” 

“Nor do I. Nor shall we. But you 
can listen while I explain it to Poddy. 
Dear, your uncle is a stubborn man 
and he won’t accomplish his own 
political downfaD lightly. 1 need a 
string to make him dance — and in 
you I have that string. I’m sure.” 
‘Tm not!” 

“Want a slap? Or would you rather 
be gagged? I like you, dear; don’t 



force me to be forceful. In yow, I 
said. Not your brother. Oh, no doubt 
your uncle goes through the solemn 
farce of treating his niece and his 
nephew just alike — Christmas pres- 
ents and birthday presents and such 
like pretenses. But it is obvious that 
no one could love your brother... 
not even his own mother, I venture 
to say. But the Senator does love 
you. Rather more than he wants 
anyone to suspect. So now I am 
hurting your brother a little — oh, 
just a smidgen, at worst he’ll be deaf 
— ^to let your uncle see what will 
happen to you. Unless he is a good 
boy and speaks his piece just the 
way I tell him to.” 

She looked thoughtfully at Uncle. 
“Senator, I can’t decide which of two 
methods might work the better on 
you. You see, I want to keep you 
reminded — after you agree to co- 
operate — that you did agree. Some- 
times a politician doesn’t stay 
bought. After I turn you loose 
would it be better for me to send 
your nephew along with you, to keep 
you reminded? Or would it be better 
to keep him here and work on him 
just a little each day — with his sis- 
ter watching? So that she would have 
a clear idea of what happens to her 
... if you try any tricks at Luna 
City. What’s your opinion, sir?” 

“Madam, the question does not 
arise.” 

“Really, Senator?” 

“Because I will not be at Luna 
City unless both children are with 
me. Unhurt.” 

Mrs. Grew chuckled. “Campaign

promises, Senator. I’ll reason with 
you later. But now — ” she glanced 
at an antique watch pinned to her 
gross bosom — “I think I had better 
put a stop to that dreadful racket. 
It’s giving me a headache. And I 
doubt if your nephew can hear it any 
longer, save possibly through his 
bones.” She got up and left, moving 
with surprising agility and grace for 
a woman her age and mass. 

Suddenly the noise stopped. 

I t was such a surprise that I 
would have jumped if anything 
below my neck could jump. Which 
it couldn’t 

Uncle was looking at me. “Poddy, 
Poddy,” he said softly. 

I said, “Uncle, don’t you give in a 
millimeter to that dreadful woman!” 
He said, “Poddy, I can*t give in to 
her. Not at all. You understand that? 
Don’t you?” 

“I certainly do! But look — ^you 
could fake it. Tell her anything. Get 
loose yourself and take Clark along, 
as she suggested. Then you can 
rescue me. I’ll hold out. You’ll see!” 
He looked terribly old. “Poddy . 
Poddy darling . I’m very much 
afraid . that this is the end. Be 
brave, dear.” 

“Uh, I haven’t had very much 
practice at that. But I’ll try to be.” 
I pinched myself, mentally, to see if 
I was scared — and I wasn’t, not 
really. Somehow I couldn’t be scared 
with Uncle there, even though he 
was helpless just then. “Uncle, what 
is it she wants? Is she some kind of 
a fanatic?” 



He didn’t answer because we both 
heard Mrs. Grew’s jolly, belly-deep 
laugh. “ ‘Fanatic!’ ” she repeated, 
came over and tweaked my cheek. 
“Poddy dear. I’m not any sort of 
fanatic and I don’t really care any 
more about politics than your uncle 
does. But I learned many years ago 
when I was just a girl — and quite 
attractive, too, dear, much more so 
than you will ever be — that a girl’s 
best friend is cash. No, dear. I’m a 
paid professional and a good one.” 

She went on briskly, “Senator, I 
think the boy is deaf but I can’t be 
sure. He’s passed out now. We’ll dis- 
cuss it later, it’s time for my nap. 
Perhaps we had all better rest a 
little.” 

And she called in Pinhead and 1 
was carried into the room I am in 
now. When he picked me up, I real- 
ly was truly aghast! — and found 
that I could move my arms and legs 
just a little bit — pins and needles 
you wouldn’t believe! — and I strug- 
gled feebly. Did me no good, I was 
dumped in here anyhow. 

After a while the drug wore off 
and 1 felt almost normal, though 
shaky. Shortly there after I discover- 
ed that Titania is a very good watch- 
dog indeed. I haven’t tried to reach 
that door since; my arm and shoul- 
der are quite sore and getting stiff. 

I nstead I inspected the room. 

Not much in it. A bed with a 
mattress but no bed-clothes, not that 
you need any in this climate. A sort 
of a table suspended from one wall 
and a chair fastened to the floor by 



PODKAYNE OF MARS

it. Glow tubes around the upper 
comers of the room. 1 checked all 
these things at once after learning 
the hard way that Titania was not 
just a cutie with gauzy wings. It was 
quite clear that Mrs. Grew, or who- 
ever had outfitted that room, had no 
intention of leaving anything in it 
that could be used as a weapon, 
against Titania or anybody. And I 
no longer had even my coat and 
purse. 

1 particularly regretted losing my 
purse, because I always carry a num- 
ber of useful things in it. A nail file, 
for example. If I had had even my 
nail file I might have considered tak- 
ing on that bloodthirsty little fairy. 
But I didn’t waste time thinking 
about it; my purse was where I had 
dropped it when I was drugged. 

I did find one thing very interest- 
ing. This room had been used to 
prison Clark before I landed in it. 
One of his two bags was in it — and 
I suppose I should have missed it 
from his room the night before, only 
I got upset and left Uncle to finish 
the search. The bag held a very odd 
collection for a knight errant ven- 
turing forth to rescue a damsel in 
distress: some clothing — three T- 
shirts and two pairs of shorts, a 
spare pair of shoes — a slide rule, 
and three comic books. 

If I had fotind a flame gun or sup- 
plies of mysterious chemicals, I 
would ■ not have been surprised — 
more Clarkish. I suppose, when you 
get right down to it, for all his bril- 
liance Clark is just a little boy, 

I worried a bit then about the 



possibility — or probability — that 

he was deaf. Then I quit thinking 
about it. If true, I couldn’t help it. 
He would miss his ears less than 
anything, since he hardly ever listens 
anyhow. 

So I lay down on the bed and read 
his comic books. I am not a comic- 
book addict but there were quite en- 
tertaining, especially as the heroes 
were always getting out of predica- 
ments much worse than mine. 

After a while I fell asleep and had 
heroic dreams. 

I was awakened by “breakfast^ 
(more like dinner but quite good). 
Pinhead took the tray away, and 
light plastic dishes and a plastic 
spoon offered little in the way of 
lethal weapons. However I was de- 
lighted to find that he had fetched 
my purse! 

Delighted for all of ten seconds, 
that is. No nail file. No pen knife. 
Not a darn thing in it more deadly 
than lipstick and hanky. Mrs. Grew 
hadn’t disturbed my money nor my 
tiny minirecorder but she had taken 
everything that could conceivably 
do any good (harm). So I gritted my 
teeth and ate and then brought this 
useless iournal up to date. That’s 
about all I’ve done since — just 
sleep and eat and make friends with 
Ariel. She reminds me of Duncan. 

Oh, not alike really — but all 
babies are sort of alike, don’t you 
think? 

I had dozed off from the lack of 
anything better to do when I 
was awakened. "Poddy, dear.”

“Ohl HeUo, Mrs. Grew.'^ 

“Now, now, no quick moves,” she 
said chidingly. I wasn’t about to 
make any quick moves; she had a 
gun pointed at my belly button. I’m 
very fond of it, it’s the only one I 
have. 

“Now be a good girl and turn over 
and cross your wrists behind you.” I 
did so and in a moment she had 
them tied, quite firmly. Then she 
looped the line around my neck and 
had me on a leash — and if I strug- 
gled, all I accomplished was choking 
myself. So I didn’t struggle. 

Oh, I’m sure there was at least a 
moment when she didn’t have that 
gun pointed at me and my wrists 
were not yet tied. One of those 
comic-book heroes would have 
snatched that golden instant, render- 
ed her helpless, tied her with her 
own rope. 

Regrettably, none of those heroes 
was named “Poddy Fries.” My edu- 
cation has encompassed cooking, 
sewing, quite a lot of math and his- 
tory and science, and such useful tid- 
bits as freehand drawing and how to 
dip candles and make soap. But hand- 
to-hand combat I have learned 
sketchily if at all from occasional 
border clashes with Clark. I know 
that Mother feels that this is a lack 
(she is skilled in both karate and 
kill-quick, and can shoot as well as 
Daddy does) but Daddy has put off 
sending me to classes. I’ve gathered 
the impression that he doesn’t really 
want his baby girl to know such 
things. 

I vote with Mother, it’s a lack. 



There must have been a split second 
when I could have lashed out with 
a heel, caught Mrs. Grew in her 
s<^ar plexus, then broken her neck 
while she was still helpless — and 
run down the Jolly Roger and run up 
the Union Jack, just like in Treasure 
Island. 

Oppernockity tunes but once — 
and I wasn’t in tune with it. 

Instead I was led away like a pup- 
py on a string. Titania eyed us as 
we went through the door, but Mrs. 
Grew clucked at her and she settled 
back on her perch and cuddled 
Ariel to her. 

She had me walk in front of her 
down a hallway, through that living 
room where I had last seen Uncle 
Tom and Clark, out another door 
and a passage and into a large 
room — 

— and I gasped and suppressed a 
scream! 

Mrs. Grew said cheerfully, “Take 
a good look, dear. He’s your next 
roommate.” 

Half the room was closed off with 
heavy steel bars, like a cage in a 
zoo. Inside was — well, it was Pin- 
head, that’s what it was, though it 
took me a long moment of fright to 
realize it. You may have gathered 
that I do not consider Pinhead hand- 
some. Well, dear, he was Apollo Bel- 
vedere before, compared with the 
red-eyed maniacal horror he had be- 
come. 

Then I was lying on the floor and 
Mrs. Grew was giving me smelling 
salts. Yes, sir, Captain Podkayne 
Fries the Famous Explorer had

keeled over like a silly girl. All right, 
go ahead and laugh; I don’t mind. 
You haven’t ever been shoved into 
a room with a thing like that and 
had it introduced to you as “your 
new roommate.” 

Mrs. Grew was chuckling. “Feel 
better, dear?” 

“You’re not going to put me in 
there with him!” 

“What? Oh,, no no, that was just 
my little joke. I’m sure your uncle 
will never make it necessary actually 
to do it.” She looked at Pinhead 
thoughtfully — and he was straining 
one arm through the bars, trying 
again and again to reach us. “He’s 
had only five milligrams, and for a 
long-time happy-dust addict that’s 
barely enough to make him tempery. 
If 1 ever do have to put you — or 
your brother — in with him, I’ve 
promised him at least fifteen. I need 
your advice, dear. You see. I’m 
about to send your uncle back to 
Venusberg so that he can catch his 



ship. Now which do you think would 
work best with your uncle? To put 
your brother in there right now, 
while your uncle watches? He’s 
watching this, you know. He saw 
you faint, and that couldn’t have 
been better if you had practiced. Or 
to wait and — ” 

“My uncle is watching us?” 
“Yes, of course. Or to — ” 
^WNCLE TOUr 
“Oh, do keep quiet, Poddy. He 
can see you but he can’t hear you 
and he can’t possibly help you. 
Hmm. You’re such a silly billy that 
I don’t think I want your advice. 
She walked me back to my cell. 

That was only hours ago; it merely 
seems like years. 

But it is long enough. Long 
enough for Poddy to lose her nerve. 
Look, I don’t have to tell this, no- 
body knows but me. But I’ve been 
truthful all through these memoirs 
and I’ll be truthful now. I have made 
up my mind that as soon as I get a 
chance to talk with Uncle I will beg 
him, plead with him, to do anything 
to keep me from being locked up 
with a happy-dusted native. 

I’m not proud of it. Fm not sure 
I’ll ever be proud of Poddy again. 
But there it is and you can rub my 
nose in it. I’ve come up against 
something that frightens me so much 
I’ve cracked. 

I feel a little better about it to 
have admitted it baldly. I sort of 
hope that, when the time comes, I 
won’t whimper and I won’t plead. 
But 1. • .just. .don’t . .know*

A nd then sombody was shoved 
in with me and it was Clark! 
I jumped up off the bed and threw 
my arms around him and lifted him 
right off his feet and was blubbering 
over him. “Oh, Clarkie! Brother, 
brother, are you hurt? What did 
they do to you? Speak to me! Are 
you deaf?” 

Right in my ear he said, “Cut out 
the sloppy stuff, Pod.” 

So I knew he wasn’t too badly 
hurt, he sounded just like Clark. 1 
repeated, more quietly, “Are you 
deaf?” 

He barely whispered in my ear, 
“No, but she thinks I am, so we’ll go 
on letting her think so.” He untan- 
gled himself from me, took a quick 
look in his bag, then rapidly and very 
thoroughly went over every bit of 
the room — giving Titania just wide 
enough berth to keep her from div- 
ing on him. 

Then he came back, shoved his 
face close to mine and said, “Poddy, 
can you read lips?” 

“No. Why?” 

“The hell you can’t, you just did.” 
Well, it wasn’t quite true. Clark 
had barely whispered — and I did 
find that I was “hearing” him as 
much from watching his mouth as I 
was from truly hearing him. This is 
a very funny thing, but Clark says 
that almost everybody reads lips 
more than they think they do. .and 
he had noticed it and practiced it 
and can really read lips — only he 
never told anybody because some- 
times it is most useful. 

He had me talk so low that 1 



couldn’t hear it myself and he didn’t 
talk much louder. He told me, “Look, 
Pod, I don’t know that Old Lady 
Grew — ” (he didn’t say “Lady”) 

— “has this room wired. I can’t find 
any changes in it since she had me 
in it before. But there are at least 
four places and maybe more where 
a mike could be. So we keep quiet — 
because it stands to reason she put 
us together to hear what we have to 
say to each other. So talk out loud 
all you want to. .but just static. 
How scared you are and how dread- 
ful it is that I can’t hear anything 
and such like noise.” 

So we did and I moaned and 
groaned and wept over my poor 
baby brother. And he complained 
that he couldn’t hear a word I was 
saying and kept asking me to find 
a pencil and write what I was saying 

— and in between we really did talk, 
important talk that Clark didn’t 
want her to hear. 

I wanted to know why he wasn’t 
deaf. Had he actually been in that 
tank? “Oh, sure,” he told me, “but 
I wasn’t nearly as limp by then as 
she thought I was, either. I had some 
paper in my pocket and I chewed ft 
up into pulp and corked my ears.” 
He looked pained. “A twenty-spot 
note. Most expensive eaiplugs any- 
body ever had. I’ll bet. Then I 
wrapped my shirt around my head 
and ignored it. But stow that and 
listen.” 

He was even more vague about 
how he had managed to get himself 
trapped. “Okay, okay, so I got hoax- 
ed. You and Uncle don’t look so 



PODKAYNE OF fAARS 



109 




smart, either. And anyhow, you’re 
responsible.” 

“I am not either responsible!” I 
whispered indignantly. 

“If you’re not responsible, then 
you’re irresponsible, which is worse. 
Logic. But forget it, we’ve got im- 
portant things to do now. Look, 
Pod, we’re going to crush out of 
here.” 

“How?” I glanced up at Titania. 
She was nursing Ariel but she never 
took her eyes off us. 

C lark followed my glance. “I’ll 
take care of that insect when 
the time comes. Forget it. It has to 
be soon and it has to be at night.” 
“Why at night?” I was thinking 
that this smoggy paradise was bad 
enough when you could see a little, 
but in pitch darkness — 

“Pod, let that cut in your face 
heal; you’re making a draft. It’s got 
to be while Jojo is locked up.” 

Jojo?’ ” 

“That set of muscles she has work- 
ing for her. The native.” 

“Oh, you mean ‘Pinhead.’” 
“Pinhead, Jojo, Albert Einstein. 
The happy-duster. He serves supper, 
then he washes the dishes, then she 
locks him up and gives him his 
night’s ration of dust. Then he stays 
locked up until he sleeps it off, be- 
cause she’s as scared of him when 
he’s, high as anybody else is. So we 
make our try for it while he is caged. 
And maybe she’ll be asleep, too. 
With luck the bloke who drives her 
sky wagon will be away, too: he 
doesn’t always sleep here. But we 



can’t count on it and it has got to be 
before the Tricorn shapes for Luna. 
When is that?” 

“Twelve seventeen on the eighth, 
ship Greenwich.” 

“Which is?” 

“Local? Nine-sixteen Venusberg, 
Wednesday the twentieth.” 

“Check,” he answered. “On both.” 

“But why?” 

“Shut up.” He had taken his slide 
rule from his bag and was setting it. 
For the conversion, I assumed, so 
I asked, “Do you want to know the 
Venus second for this Terran year?” 
I was rather proud to have it on the 
tip of my tongue, like a proper pilot; 
Mr. Clancy’s time hadn’t been en- 
tirely wasted even though I had 
never let him get cuddly. 

“Nope. I know it.” Clark reset the 
rule, read it and announced, “We 
both remember both figures the 
same way and the conversion checks. 
So check timepieces.” We both 
looked at our wrists. “Mark!” 

We agreed, within a few seconds, 
but that wasn’t what I noticed: I 
was looking at the date hand. “ClarkI 
Today’s the nineteenth!” 

“Maybe you thought it was Christ- 
mas,” he said sourly. “And don’t yip 
like that again. 

“But that’s tomorrow!” (I did 
make it soundless.) 

“Worse. It’s less than seventeen 
hours from now. .and we can’t 
make a move until that brute is 
locked up. We get just one chance, 
no more.” 

“Or Uncle Tom doesn’t get to the 
Conference.” 



no 



II 




Clark shrugged. “Maybe so, may- 
be not. Whether he decides to go — 
or sticks around and tries to find us, 
I couldn’t care less.” 

Clark was being very talkative, for 
Clark. But at best he grudges words 
and I didn’t understand him. “What 
do you me2Ui? ‘If he sticks around’?” 
Apparently Clark thought he had 
told me, or that I already knew — 
but he hadn’t and I didn’t. Uncle 
Tom was already gone. I felt sudden- 
ly lost and forlorn. “Clark, are you 
sure?” 

“Sure, I’m sure. She darn well saw 
to it that I saw him go. Jojo loaded 
him in like a sack of meal and I 
saw the wagon take off into the 
smog. Uncle Tom is in Venusberg 
by now.” 

I suddenly felt much better. 
“Then he’ll rescue usi” 

Clark looked bored. “Pod, don’t 
be stupid squared.” 

“But he will! Uncle Tom. .and 
Mr. Chairman. .and Dexter — ” 

He cut me off. “Oh, for Pete’s 
sake, Poddy! Analyze it. You’re 
Uncle Tom, you’re in Venusberg, 
you’ve got all the help possible. How 
do you find this place?” 

“Uh. I stopped. “Uh — ” I said 

again. Then I closed my mouth and 
left it closed. 

“ ‘Uh,* ” he agreed: “Exactly ‘uh.’ 
You don’t find it. Oh, in eight or 
ten years with a few thousand people 
doing nothing but searching you 
could find it by elimination. Fat lot 
of good that would do. Get this 
through your little head. Sis: nobody 



is going to rescue us, nobody can 
possibly help us. We either break out 
of here tonight, or we’ve had it.” 
“Why tonight? Oh, tonight’s all 
right with me. But if we don’t get a 
chance tonight — ” 

“Then at nine-sixteen tomorrow,” 
he interrupted, “we’re dead.”, 
“Huh? Why?” 

“Pod, put yourself in old Grue- 
some’s place. Tomorrow the Tricorn 
leaves. Figure it both ways: Uncle 
Tom leaves in it, or Uncle Tom 
won’t leave. Okay, you’ve got his 
niece and nephew. What do you do 
with them? Be logical about it. Her 
sort of logic.” 

I tried. I really tried. But maybe 
I’ve been brought up wrong for that 
sort of logic; I can’t seem to visual- 
ize killing somebody just because he 
or she had become a nuisance to me. 

But I could see that Clark was 
right that far: after ship’s departure 
tomorrow we will simply be nui- 
sances to Mrs. Grew. If Uncle Tom 
doesn't leave, we are most special 
nuisances — and if he does leave 
and she is counting on his worry 
about us to keep him in line at Luna 
City (it wouldn’t, of course, but that 
is what she is counting on anyway), 
in that case every day she risks the 
possibility that we might escape and 
get word to Uncle. 

All right, maybe I can’t imagine 
just plain murder; it’s outside my 
experience. But suppose both Clark 
and I came down with green pox and 
died. That would certainly be con- 
venient for Mrs. Grew — now, 
wouldn’t it?

“I scan it,” I agreed. 

*‘Good,” he said. “I’ll teach you a 
thing or four yet, Pod. Either we 
make it tonight. .or just past nine 
tomorrow she chills us both. .and 
she chills Jojo, too, and sets fire to 
the place.” 

“Why Jojo? I mean ‘Pinhead.’ ” 
“That’s the real tipoff, Pod. The 
happy-duster. This is Venus. .and 
yet she let us see that she was sup- 
plying dust to a duster. She won’t 
leave any witnesses.” 

“Uncle Tom is a witness, too.” 
“What if he is? She’s counting on 
his keeping his lip zipped until the 
conference is over. By then she’s 
back on Earth and has lost herself 
among eight billion people. Hang 
around here and risk being caught? 
Pod, she’s going to wait here only 
long enough to find out whether or 
not Uncle Tom catches the Tricorn, 
Then she’ll carry out either Plan A 
or Plan B — but both plans cancel 
us out. Get that through your fuzzy 
head.” 

1 shivered. “All right. I’ve got it.” 
He grinned. “But we don’t wait. 
We execute our own plan — my 
plan — first.” He looked unbearably 
smug and added, “You fubbed when 
you came out here without doing 
any of the things I told you to. 
and Uncle Tom fubbed just about 
as badly, thinking he could make 
sr straight payoff. .but I came out 
here prepared!” 

“You did? With what? Your slide 
rule? Or maybe those comic books?” 
Clark said, “Pod, you know 1 



never read comic books. They were 
just protective coloration.” 

(And this is true, so far as I know. 
I thought I had uncovered his Secret 
Vice.) 

“Then what?” I demanded. 

“Just compose your soul in pa- 
tience, Sister Dear. All in good time.” 
He moved his bag back of the bed, 
then added. “Move around here 
where you can watch down the hall- 
way. If Lady Macbeth shows up, 
I’m reading comic books.” 

I did as he told me to but asked 
him one more question — on another 
subject, as quizzing Clark when he 
doesn’t want to answer is as futile as 
slicing water. “Clark? You figure 
Mrs. Grew is part of the gang that 
'imuggled the bomb?” 

He blinked and looked stupid. 
“What bomb?” 

“The one they paid you to sneak 
aboard the Tricorn, of course! ‘What 
bomb’ indeed!” 

“Oh, that. Golly, Poddy, you be- 
lieve everything you’re told. When 
you get to Terra, don’t let anybody 
sell you the Pyramids. They’re not 
for sale.” He went on worldng and 
I smothered my annoyance. 

Presently he said, “She couldn’t 
possibly know anything about any 
bombs in the Tricorn, or she wouldn’t 
have been a passenger in it herself.” 

Clark can always make me feel 
stupid. This was so obvious (after he 
pointed it out) that I refrained from 
comment. “How do you figure it, 
then?” 

“Well, she could have been hired 
by the same people and not have 



112 



IP 




known that they were just using her 
as a reserve." 

My mind raced and another an- 
swer came up. *‘In which case there 
could be still a third plot to get 
Uncle Tom between here and Luna!” 
“Could be. Certainly a lot of peo- 
ple are taking an interest in him. 
But I figure it for two groups. One 
group — almost certainly from 
Mars — doesn’t want Uncle Tom to 
get there at all. Another group — 
from Earth probably, at least old 
gruesome actually did come from 
Earth — wants him to be there but 
wants him to sing their song. Other- 
wise when she had Uncle Tom, she 
would never have turned him loose. 
She would just have had Jojo shove 
him into a soft spot and wait for 
the bubbles to stop coming up.” 
Clark dug out something and looked 
at it. “Pod, repeat this back and 
don’t make a sound. You are ex- 
actly twenty-three kilometers from 
South Gate and almost due south of 
it — south seven degrees west.” 

I repeated it. “How do you know? 
He held up a small black object 
about as big as two packs of ciga- 
rettes. “Inertial tracker, infantry 
model. You can buy them anywhere 
here. Anybody who ever goes out 
into the bush carries one.” He 
handed it to me. 

1 looked at it with interest. I had 
never soon one that small. Sand 
rats use them, of course, but they 
use bigger, more accurate ones 
mounted in their sand buggies — 
and, anyhow, on Mars you can al- 



ways see either the stars or the Sun. 
Not like this gloomy place! I even 
knew how it worked, more or less, 
because inertial astrogation is a com- 
monplace for space ships and guided 
missiles — vector integration of ac- 
celerations and times. But whereas 
the Tricornes inertial tracker is sup- 
posed to be good for one part in a 
million, this little gadget probably 
couldn’t be read closer than one in 
a thousand. 

But it improved our chances at 
least a thousand to one! 

“Clark! Did Uncle Tom have one 
of these? ‘Cause if he did — ” 

He shook his head. “If he did, he 
never got a chance to read it. I fig- 
ure they gassed him at once; he was 
limp when they lifted him out of the 
air wagon. And I never had a chance 
to tell him where this dump is be- 
cause this has been my first chance 
to look at mine. Now put it in your 
purse; you’re going to use it to get 
back to Venusberg.” 

“Uh. .it’ll be bulky in my purse, 
it’ll show. You better hide it wher- 
ever you had it. You won’t lose me, 
I’m going to hang onto your hand 
every step of the way.” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“In the first place I’m not going 
to drag this bag with me and that’s 
where it was hidden, I built a false 
bottom into it. In the second place 
we aren’t going back together.” 
“What? Why not? We certainly 
are! Clark, I’m responsible for you.” 
“That’s a matter of opinion. Your 
opinion. Look, Poddy, I’m going to

get you out of this silly mess. But 
don’t try to use your head, it leaks. 
Just your memory. Listen to what I 
say and then do it exactly the way 
I tell you to — and you’ll be all 
right.” 

“But — ” 

“Do you have a plan to get us 
out?” 

“No.” 

“Then shut up. You start pulling 
your Big Sister act now and you’ll 
get us both killed.” 

I shut up. And I must confess that 
his plan made considerable sense. Ac- 
cording to Clark there is nobody in 
this house but us, Mrs. Grew, Ti- 
tania and Ariel, Pinhead and some- 
times her driver. I certainly haven’t 
seen nor heard any evidence of any- 
body else and I suppose that Mrs. 
Grew has been doing it with an ab- 
solute minimum of witnesses. I know 
I would if I were (God forbid!) ever 
engaged in anything like this. 

I’ve never seen the driver’s face 
and neither has Clark — on purpose. 
I’m sure. But Clark says that the 
driver sometimes stays overnight, so 
we must^e prepared to cope with 
him. 

Okay, assume that we cope. As 
soon as we are out of the house we 
split up. 1 go east, he goes west, for 
a couple of kilometers, in straight 
lines as near as bogs and swamps 
permit, Which may be not very. 

Then we both turn north. Clark 
says that the ring road around the 
city is just three kilometers north of 
us; he drew me a sketch from mem- 
ory of a map he had studied before 
he set out to “rescue Girdie.” 



At the ring road I go right, he 
goes left — and we each make use 
of the first hitch-hike transportation, 
ranch-house phone or whatever, to 
reach Uncle Tom and or Chairman 
Cunha and get lots of reinforcements 
in a hurry! 

T he idea of splitting up is the most 
elementary of tactics, to make 
sure that at least one of us 
gets through and gefs help. Mrs. 
Grew is so fat she couldn’t chase 
anybody on a race track, much less 
a swamp. We plan to do it when she 
doesn’t dare unlock Pinhead for fear 
of her own life. If we are chased, it 
will probably be the driver — and 
he can’t chase two directions at once. 
Maybe there are other natives she 
can call on for help. Even so, split- 
ting up doubles our chances. 

So I get the inertial tracker be- 
cause Clark doesn’t think I can ma- 
neuver in the bush without one, even 
if I wait for it to get light. He’s prob- 
ably right. But he claims that he 
can steer well enough to find that 
road using just his watch, a wet fin- 
ger for the breeze and polarized 
spectacles — which, so help me, he 
has with him. 

I shouldn’t have sneered at his 
comic books. He actually did come 
prepared, quite a lot of ways. If 
they hadn’t gassed him while he was 
still locked in the passenger com- 
partment of Mrs. Grew’s air buggy, 
I think he could have given them a 
very busy, bad time. A flame gun in 
his bag, a Remington pistol hidden 
on his person, knives, stun bombs — 



114 



IF 




even a second inertial tracker, open- 
ly in the bag along with his clothes 
and comic books and slide rule. 

I asked him why? — and he put 
his best superior look. “If anything 
went wrong and they grabbed me, 
they would expect me to have one. 
So I had one — and it hadn’t even 
been started. .poor little tenderfoot 
who doesn’t even know enough to 
switch the thing on when he leaves 
his base position. Old Gruesome got 
a fine chuckle out of that.” He 
sneered. “She thinks I’m half-witted 
and I’ve helped the idea along.” 

So they did the same thing with 
his bag that they did with my purse 

— cleaned everything out of it that 
looked even faintly useful for may- 
hem and murder, let him keep what 
was left. 

And most of what was left was 
concealed by a false bottom so beau- 
tifully faked that the manufacturer 
wouldn’t have noticed it. 

Except, possibly, for the weight. 
I asked Clark about that. He 
shrugged. “Calculated risk,” he said. 
“If you don’t bet. you can’t win. 
Jojo carried it in here still packed 
and she searched it in here — and 
didn’t pick it up afterwards; she had 
both arms full of junk I didn’t mind 
her confiscating.” 

(And suppose she had picked it 
up and noticed? Well. Brother would 
still have had his brain and his hands 

— and I think he could take a sew- 
ing machine apart and put it back 
together as a piece of artillery. Clark 
is a trial to me, but 1 have great 
confidence in him.) 



I’m going to get some sleep now 
— or try to — as Pinhead has just 
fetched in our supper and we have 
a busy time ahead of us, later. But 
first I’m going to back-track this 
tape and copy it. I have one fresh 
spool left in my purse. I’m goin^ to 
give the copy to Clark to give to 
Uncle, just in case. Just in case Pod 
turns out to be bubbles in a swamp, 
I mean. But I’m not worried about 
that; it’s a much nicer prospect than 
being Pinhead’s roommate. In fact 
I’m not worried about anything. 
Clark has the situation well in hand. 

B ut he warned me very strongly 
about one thing: “Tell them to 
get here well before nine-sixteen. 
or don’t bother to come at all.” 
“Why?” I wanted to know. 

“Just do it.” 

“Clark, you know perfectly well 
that two grown men won’t pay any 
attention unless I can give them a 
sound reason for it.” 

He blinked. “All right. There is a 
very sound reason. A half a kiloton 
bomb isn’t very much. .but it still 
isn’t healthy to be around when it 
goes off. Unless they can get in here 
and disarm it before that time — up 
she goes!” 

He has it. I’ve seen it. Snugly fitted 
into that false bottom. That same 
three kilograms of excess mass 1 
couldn’t account for at Deimos. 
Clark showed me the timing mecha- 
nism and how the shaped charges 
were nestled around it to produce 
the implosion squeeze. 

But he did not show me how to dis- 

110 



PODKAYNE OF MARS 




arm it. I ran into his blankest, most 
stubborn wall. He expects to escape, 
yes. And he expects to come back 
here with plenty of help and in plen- 
ty of time and disarm the thing. But 
he is utterly convinced that Mrs. 
Grew intends to kill us — and if any- 
thing goes wrong and we don’t break 
out of here, or die trying, or any- 
thing. .well, he intends to take her 
with us. 

I told him it was wrong, I said 
that he mustn’t take the law in his 
own hands. “What law?” he said. 
“There isn’t any law here. And you 
aren’t being logical, Pod. Anything 
that is right for a group to do is 
right for one person to do.” 

That one was too slippery for me 
to answer so I tried simply pleading 
with him and he got sore. “Maybe 
you would rather be in the cage with 
Jojo?” 

“Well. .no.” 

“Then shut up about it. Look, Pod, 
I planned all this out when she had 
me in that tank, trying to beat my 
ears in, make me deaf. I kept my 
sanity by ignoring what was being 
done to me and concentrating on 
when and how 1 would blow her to 
bits.” 

I wondered if he had indeed kept 
his sanity, but I kept my doubts to 
myself and shut up. Besides I’m not 
sure that he’s wrong; it may be that 
I’m just ^squeamish about bloodshed. 
“Anything that is moral for a group 
to do is moral for one person to do.” 
There must be a flaw in that, since 
I’ve always been taught that it is 
wrong to take the law in your own 



hands. But I didn*t find the flaw and 
it sounds axiomatic, self evident. 
Switch it around. If something is 
wrong for one person to do, can it 
possibly be made right by having a 
lot of people (a government) agree 
to do it together? Even unanimously? 

If a thing is wrong, it is wrong — 
and vox populi can’t change it. 

Just the same, I’m not sure I can 
nap with an atom bomb under my 
bed. 

1 guess I had better finish this. 
This is Clark speaking. 

My sister got right to sleep after 
I rehearsed her in what we were 
going to do. I stretched out on the 
floor but didn’t go right to sleep. 
I’m a worrier, she isn’t. I reviewed 
my plans, trying to make them tight- 
er. Then I slept. 

I’ve got one of those built-in alarm 
clocks and I woke just when I 
planned to, an hour before dawn. 
Any later and there would be too 
much chance that Jojo might be 
loose, any earlier and there would 
be too much time in the dark. The 
Venus bush is chancy even when you 
can see well. I didn’t want Poddy to 
step into something sticky, or step 
on something that would turn and 
bite her leg off. Nor me, either. 

But we had to risk the bush, or 
stay and let old Gruesome kill us 
at her convenience. The first was a 
sporting chance. The latter was a 
dead certainty, even though I had a 
terrible time convincing Poddy that 
Mrs. Grew would kill us. Poddy’s 
greatest weakness — the really soft 



116 



if 




place in her head, she’s not too stu- 
pid otherwise — is her almost total 
inability to grasp that some people 
are as bad as they are. Evil. Poddy 
never has understood evil. Naughti- 
ness is about as far as her imagina- 
tion reaches. 

But I understand evil, I can get 
right inside the skull of a person like 
Mrs. Grew. 

Perhaps you infer from this that 
I am evil, or partly so. All right, 
want to make something of it? What- 
ever / am, I knew Mrs. Grew was 
evil before we ever left the Tricorn 
. when Poddy (and even Girdie!) 
thought the slob was just too darling 
for words. x 

I don’t trust a person who laughs 
when there is nothing to laugh about. 
Or is good-natured no matter what 
happens. If it’s that perfect, it’s an 
act, a phony. So I watched her. 
and cheating at solitaire wasn’t the 
only give-away. 

So between the bush and Mrs. 
Grew, 

Unless the air car was there and 
we could swipe it. This would be a 
mixed blessing, as it would mean two 
of them to cope with, them armed 
and us not. (I don’t count a bomb 
as an arm, you can’t point it at a 
person’s head.) 

Before I woke Poddy I took care 
of that alate pseudo-simian, that 
“fairy.” Vicious little beast. I didn’t 
have a gun. But I didn’t really want 
one at that point; they understand 
about guns and are hard to hit, 
they’ll dive on you at once. 



Instead I had shoe trees in my 
spare shoes, elastic bands around my 
spare clothes and more elastic bands 
in my pockets, and several two-centi- 
meter steel ball bearings. 

Shift two wing nuts, and the long 
parts of the shoe trees become a 
steel fork. Add elastic bands and 
you have a sling shot. And don’t 
laugh at a sling shot; many a sand 
rat has kept himself fed with only a 
sling shot. They are silent and you 
usually get your ammo back. 

1 aimed almost three times as 
high as I would at home, to allow 
for the local gravity, and got it right 
on the sternum, knocked it off its 
perch — crushed the skull with my 
heel and gave it an extra twist for 
the nasty bite on Poddy’s arm. The 
young one started to whine, so I 
pushed the carcass over in the cor- 
ner, somewhat out of sight, and put 
the cub on it. It shut up. I took care 
of all this before I woke Poddy be- 
cause I knew she had sentimental 
fancies about these “fairies” and I 
didn’t want her jittering and maybe 
grabbing my elbow. As it was — 
clean and fast. 

Poddy was still snoring, so I 
slipped off my shoes and made a 
fast reconnoitre. 

Not so good. Our local witch was 
already up and reaching for her 
broom. In a few minutes she would 
be unlocking Jojo if she hadn’t al- 
ready. I didn’t have a chance to see 
if the sky car was outside; I did well 
not to get caught. I hurried back 
and woke Poddy. 



PODKAYNE OF AURS 



117 




“Pod!” I whispered. “You awake? 

“Yes.” 

“Wide awake? You’ve got to do 
your act, right now. Make it loud 
and make it good.” 

“Check.” 

“Help me up on the perch. Can 
your sore arm take it?” 

She nodded, slid quickly off the 
bed and took position at the door, 
hands ready. I grabbed her hands, 
bounced to her shoulders, steadied, 
and she grabbed my calves as I let 
go her hands — and then I was up 
on the perch, over the door. I waved 
her on. 

Poddy went running out the door, 
screaming, “Mrs. Grew! Mrs, Grew! 
Help, help! My brother!” She did 
make it good. 

And came running back in almost 
at once with Mrs. Grew puffing after 
her. 

I landed on Gruesome’s shoulders, 
knocking her to the floor and knock- 
ing her gun out of her hand. I twisted 
and snapped her neck before she 
could catch her breath. 

Pod was right on the ball, I have 
to give her credit. She had that gun 
before it stopped sliding. Then she 
held It, looking dazed. 

I took it carefully from her. “Grab 
your purse. We go, right now! Stick 
close behind me.” 

Jojo was loose. I had cut it too 
fine. He was in the living room, look- 
ing, I guess, to see what the noise 
was about. 1 shot him. 

Then 1 looked for the air car while 
keeping the gun ready for the driver. 
No sign of either one — and I didn’t 



know whether to groan or cheer. I 
was all keyed up to shoot him but 
maybe he would have shot me first. 
But a car would have been mighty 
welcome compared with heading in- 
to the bush. 

I almost changed my plan at that 
point and maybe I should have. Kept 
together, I mean, and headed 
straight north for the ring road. 

It was the gun that decided me. 
Poddy could protect herself with it 
— and I would just be darn .careful 
what I stepped on or in. I handed 
it to her and told her to move slowly 
and carefully until there was more 
light — but get going! 

She was wobbling the gun around. 
“But, Brother, I’ve never shot any- 
body!” 

“Well, you can if you have to.” 

“I guess so.” 

“Nothing to it. Just point it at ’em 
and press the button. Better use both 
hands. And don’t shoot unless you 
really need to.” 

“AU right.” 

I smacked her behind. “Now get 
going. See you later.” 

And I got going. I looked behind 
once, but she was already vanished 
in the smog. I put a little distance 
between me and the house. 

And I got lost. 

T hat’s all. I needed that tracker 
but I had figured I could get 
along without it and Pod had to have 
it. I got hopelessly lost. There wasn’t 
breeze enough for me to tell any- 
thing by wetting my finger and that 
polarized light trick for finding the 



118 



IP 




Sun is harder than you would think. 
Hours after I should have reached 
the ring road I was still skirting 
boggy places and open water and 
trying to keep from being some- 
body’s lunch. 

And suddenly there was the most 
dazzling light possible and I went 
down flat and stayed there with my 
eyes buried in my arm and started 
to count. 

I wasn’t hurt at all. The blast wave 
covered me with mud and the noise 
was pretty rough but I was well out- 
side the real trouble. Maybe half an 
hour later I was picked up by a cop 
car. 

Certainly 1 should have disarmed 
that bomb. 

I had intended to, if everything 
went well; it was just meant to be a 
“Samson in the Temple” stunt if 
things turned out dry. A last resort. 

Maybe I should have stopped to 
disarm it as soon as I broke old 
Gruesome’s neck — and maybe Jojo 
would have caught both of us if I 
had, and him still with a happy-dust 
hangover. 

Anyhow 1 didn’t, and then I was 
very busy shooting Jojo and decid- 
ing what to do and telling Poddy 
how to use that gun and getting her 
started. 1 didn’t think about the bomb 
until I was several hundred meters 
from the house — and I certainly 
didn’t want to go back then, even if 
1 could have found it again in the 
smog, which is doubtful. 

But apparently Poddy did just that. 
Went back to the house. 1 mean. 
She was found later that day, about 



a kilometer from the house, outside 
the circle of total destruction — but 
caught by the blast. 

With a live baby fairy in her arms. 
Her body had protected it; it doesn’t 
appear to have been hurt at all. 

That’s why I think she went hack 
to the house. I don’t know that this 
baby fairy is the one she called 
“Ariel.” It could have been one that 
she picked up in the bush. But that 
doesn’t seem at all likely; a wild one 
would have clawed her and its par- 
ents would have torn her to pieces. 

I think she intended to save that 
baby fairy all along and decided not 
to mention it to me. It is just the 
kind of sentimental stunt that Poddy 
would pull. She knew I was going to 
have to kill the adult — and she 
never said a word against that; Pod 
could always be sensible when ab- 
solutely necessary. 

Then in the excitement of break- 
ing out she forgot to grab it, just as 
I forgot to disarm the bomb after 
we no longer needed it. So she went 
back for it. 

And lost the inertial tracker, some- 
how. At least it wasn’t found on her 
or near her. Between the gun and 
her purse and the baby fairy and the 
tracker she must have dropped it in 
the bog. Must be. because she had 
plenty of time to go back and still 
get far away from the house. She 
should have been ten kilometers 
away by then, so she must have lost 
the tracker fairly soon and walked 
in a circle. 

1 told Uncle Tom all about it and 
was ready to tell the Corporation

people, Mr. Cunha and so forth, and 
take my medicine. But Uncle told 
me to keep my mouth shut. He 
agreed that I had fubbed it, mighty 
dry indeed — ^^but so had he — and 
so had everybody. He was gentle 
with me. 

I wish he had hit me. 

I’m sorry about Poddy. She gave 
me some trouble from time to time, 
with her bossy ways and her illogical 
ideas. But just the same Fm sorry. 
I wish I knew how to cry. 

Her little recorder was still in her 
purse and part of the tape could be 
read. Doesn’t mean much, though. 
She doesn’t tell what she did, she 
was babbling, sort of: 

“ — very dark where I’m going. 
No man is an island, complete in 
himself. Remember that, Clarkie. 
Oh, Fm sorry I fubbed it but re- 
member that; it’s important. They 
all have to be cuddl^ sometimes. 
My shoulder — Saint Podkayne! 
Saint Podkayne, are you listening? 
U n k a T o m. Mother, Daddy — is 
anybody listening? Do listen, please, 
because this is important. I love — ” 
It cuts off there. So we don’t 
know whom she loved. 

Everybody, maybe. 

I ’m alone here, now. Mr. Cunha 
made them hold the Tricorn until 
it was certain whether Poddy would 
die or -get well, then Uncle Tom 
left and left me behind — alone, that 
is, except for doctors, and nurses, 
and Dexter Cunha hanging around 
all the time, and a whole platoon 
of guards. 



I heard part of what Uncle Tom 
told Dad about it. 

“Nonsense, sir! I am not dodging 
my own load of guilt. It will be with 
me always. Nor can I wait here until 
you arrive and you know it and you 
know why — and both children will 
be safer in Mr. Cunha’s hands and 
not close to me. .and you know 
that, too! But I have a message for 
you, sir, one that you should 
pass on to your wife. Just thi^: people 
who will not take the trouWe to 
raise children should not have them. 
You with your nose always in a book, 
your wife gallivanting off God knows 
where — between you, your daugh- 
ter was almost killed. No credit to 
either of you that she wasn’t. Just 
blind luck. You should tell your wife 
sir, that building bridges and space 
stations and such gadgets is all very 
well. .but that a woman has more 
important work to do. I tried to 
suggest this to you years ago. .and 
was told to mind my own business. 
Now I am saying it. Your daughter 
will get well, no thanks to either of 
you. But I have my doubts about 
Clark. With him it may be too late. 
God may give you a second chance 
if you hurry. Ending transmission!” 

I faded into the woodwork then 
and didn’t get caught. But what did 
Uncle Tom mean by that? — trying 
to scare Dad about me? I wasn’t hurt 
at all and he knows it. I just got a 
load of mud on me, not even a bum 
. .whereas Poddy still looks like a 
corpse. 

I don’t see what he was driving at.

I, EXECUTIONER 

BY TED WHITE AND TERRY CARR 



I am the exeeutloner of the 
law, terrible in my majesty. 
The doomed felon is — myselfl 



1 always shook when I can 5 out of 
the Arena, but tLis time the 
tension wrapped my stomach in 
painful knots and salty perspiration 
stung my neck where 1 had shaved 
only a little over an hour earlier. 
And despite the heavy knot in my 
stomach. I felt strangely empty. 

I had never been able to sort out 
my reactions to an Execution. The 
atmosphere of careful boredom, the 
strictly business-as-usual air failed 
to duU my senses as it did for the 
others. I could always taste the ozone 



In the air, mixed with the taste of 
fear — ^whether mine, or that of the 
Condemned, I never knew. My nos- 
trils always gave an involuntary 
twitch at the confined odors and I 
felt an almost claustrophic fear at 
being packed into the Arena with 
the other nine hundred ninety-nine 
Citizens on Execution Duty. 

I had been expecting my notice 
for several months before it finally 
came. 1 hadn’t served Execution 
Duty for nearly two years. Usually 
it had figured out to every fourteen 



PODKAYNE OF MARS 



Iff 



months or so on rotation, so I’d been 
ready for it. A little apprehensive — 
I always am — but ready. 

At 9:00 in the morning, still only 
half awake (I’d purposely slept un- 
til the last minute), vaguely trying 
to remember the dream I’d had, I 
waited in front of the Arena for the 
ordeal to begin. The dream had been 
something about a knife, an opera- 
tion. But I couldn’t remember whe- 
ther I’d been the doctor or the pa- 
tient. 

Our times of arrival had been stag- 
gered in our notices, so that a long 
queue wouldn’t tie up traffic, but 
as usual the checkers were slow, and 
we were backed up a bit. 

1 didn’t like waiting. Somehow 
I’ve always felt more exposed on the 
streets, although the brain-scanners 
must be more plentiful in an Arena 
than almost anywhere else. It’s only 
logical that they should be. The 
scanners are set up to detect unusual 
patterns of stress in our brain waves 
as we pass close to them, and thus 
to pick out as quickly as possible 
those with incipient or developing 
neuroses or psychoses — the poten- 
tial deviates. And where else would 
such an aberration be as likely to 
come out as in the Arena? 

I had moved to the front of the 
short line. 1 flashed my notification 
of duty to the checker, and was 
waved on in. 1 found my proper 
seat on the aisle in the “T” section. 
It was a relief to sink into its plush 
depths and look the Arena over. 

Once this had been a first-run 
Broadway theater — first a place 



where great plays were shown, and 
then later the more degenerate mo- 
tion pictures. Those had been times 
of vicarious escape from reality — 
times when the populace ruled, and 
yet the masses hid their eyes from 
the world. Many things had changed 
since then, with the coming of regu- 
lated sanity and the achievement of 
world peace. Gone now were the 
black arts of forgetfulness, those me- 
dia which practiced the enticement 
of the Citizen into irresponsible es- 
cape. Now this crowded theater was 
only a reminder. And a place of ex- 
ecution for those who would have 
sought escape here. 

P erhaps thirty people were sitting 
on the floor of the Arena, 
where once there had been a stage. 
They sat quietly in chairs not so dif- 
ferent from mine, strapped for the 
moment into a kind of passive con- 
formity. I looked at them with in- 
terest. Strangeness has as much at- 
traction as the familiar at times. As 
usual, most of them were young — 
from about ten to the early twen- 
ties. But at whatever age, they were 
rebels. They were potential enemies 
of society. Criminals. Probably some 
of them hadn’t yet realized it. But 
they were on the verge of anti-so- 
cial insanity, and the brain-scanners 
had singled them out. 

They were so young . How long 
does it take a boy to become neu- 
rotic, psychotic, dangerous? 

A flurry of movement at the gates 
caught my eye. Apparently at least 
one of them was a full-fledged Reb-

th He struggled furiously, and the 
three proctors were having an awk- 
ward time carrying him into the 
Arena without hurting him. 

Then, as they moved into the 
floodlights, I saw with a faint shock 
that it was a girl. 

She was dressed in man’s clothing, 
but betrayed by her neurotic and un- 
sanitary long hair. 

Long, blonde hair. For a moment 
I forgot where I was, and allowed 
myself to revel in this nearly for- 
bidden sight. The soft waves fell 
alfway down her neck, disarrayed 
now. The floodlights shined on it, 
a strangely gentle mockery of sun- 
light. Something within me stirred, 
and I almost remembered . 

Then they were strapping her in- 
to one of the chairs, carefully pull- 
ing the soft leather straps with their 
attached metal electrodes around 
her, pinioning her. One set joined her 
arms to the armrests, another her 
legs to the specially devised footrests. 
Her tunic was opened, and a third 
set was passed around her chest, 
the metal plate fastened just under 
her left breast. 

And then she was alone. 

1 stared at her, drawn at first to 
her hair, and then, as my vision fo- 
cused across the distance, to her 
eyes. 

Strange eyes; light blue irises, sur- 
rounded by a ring of dark blue, and 
flecked with gold. They were shin- 
ing. She had been crying. Her eyes 
seemed to melt, like a pool of clear 
water growing deeper; I could al- 
most see into them, into the darkness 



beneath. I was no longer aware of 
the chair in which I sat . only 
of her, alone before me, so close. 

Her eyes widened for just an in- 
stant when she recognized me.

**Don*t" she said. "Don't ever

S un drenched me, and I was rocked 
back into time. 

“Hey, you pushed me!” I shout- 
ed at her. 

“Yes,” said a faint voice, and then, 
“I’m sorry,” the little golden-haired 
girl said. 

I sat up. Mother was going to be 
mad at me again, I knew. I wiped 
the seat of my pants with my hand, 
and then stared at the muddy hand 
with interest. 

“Look,” I said to her, and showed 
her my hand. When she stepped for- 
ward to look closely at it, 1 pushed 
it at her, and smeared mud onto her 
face. Then I laughed . 

★ ★ ★ 

My laughter faded, blending with 
hers . and then . and then we 
were no longer standing separately 
in the sun. 

It was a dark night, the air fresh 
and cool to my skin, and the leaves 
of the trees which stretched over us 
rustled with a faint wind. 

1 laughed again, a soft girlish 
sound that brought discomfort to 
the boy’s face before me.

“Your mother says. Your father 
says. Don’t you ever say anything 
for yourself, Bob?” 

“Look, Rosalie, I’m sorry. Maybe 
I just don’t think the way you do. 
My father says sex at our age is 
just another escape from reality. 
You’ve got to face yourself as an 
adult first. He — ” 

“Your father is a biggw nincom- 
poop than you are!” I shouted at 
him. “I thought you said you loved 
me. I thought you had some feelings 
buried under that so-called rational 
mind of yours! Or does your father 
say you’re too young to love some- 
body?” 

He tried to say something, but 
I was right. He pressed his lips to- 
gether and looked away. I was al- 
most enjoying it now; with deliber- 
ate coolness I buttoned up my tunic, 
feeling the soft fibers on my skin. 

“How long does it take to love 
somebody?” I said, but my voice 
was beginning to tremble. I turned 
away from his still figure in the 
night, and began the slow walk back 
along the path to the house. Tears 
stung my eyes, and spilled onto my 
cheeks; I started to run through the 
dark. 

1 slammed the door when 1 ran 
in, and went directly to my room. 
At one eiid of it was a small studio, 
where an easel was lit coldly by a 
fluorescent light. Almost blindly I 
began beating my fists on the stiB- 
wet canvas, blurring and then rip- 
ping the nearly finished portrait 
of a young man. 



I was crying quietly when the low, 
calm voice stopped me on the 
street. 

“Just a moment. Miss.” 

I felt the sudden skip in my heart 
which signaled danger, and when I 
turned I saw the light green uniform 
of a jM-octor in the vague street light. 
My eyes were still blurred with tears. 
I couldn’t make out his face. 

“I’m sorry, but I’ll have to ask 
you a few questions.” 

Shielding my face from the light, 

I tried to make my voice calm. I 
hoped my homesick tears were hid- 
den, that my cheeks wouldn’t glis- 
ten in the light. I wanted very badly 
for him not to see I had been crying. 
“Yes?” 

“I’ll have to know why you’re 
out on the streets at this time of the 
morning,” the proctor said. “There’s 
a curfew, you know. Unless you can 
show cause ...” 

Oh God; I had completely for- 
gotten the city’s curfew! 

“I — I’m sorry, Officer. I’m new 
to the city and I didn’t realize . .” 
“You’re transient? Where are you 
staying?” 

“The Statler Dormitory for Wom- 
en,” I answered meekly. 

“And why are you out at this 
hour, so far from the dorm? That’s 
down near 34th Street, almost thirty 
blocks south.” 

“I know. I couldn’t sleep — ” His 
eyes narrowed at that; had I made a 
mistake? I plunged on: “ — ^and I 
wanted to see Central Park. I didn’t 
realize there was any harm . 

“I guess not this time. Miss, but 

IF 



124 




you’d better get back to your dorm. 
Take this pass.” He scribbled a few 
words on a pad and then detached 
a slip of green paper for me. “You 
can take a train down to 34th Street. 
Now.” 

“I’d just as soon walk, sir.” 

He stared at me for a moment 
and then I turned and started for 
the nearest subway entrance. 

It had been horrible, those first 
few days in the Dorm. I’d never 
dreamed that a sane society could 
be so . not cruel, but unthinking. 
Back home in Woodstock we were 
all supposed to be sane too, but nei- 
ther Father nor Mother had ever 
forced any rigid rules on me. They 
had let me roam the woods, scuffing 
the dry leaves in autumn, drinking 
water from the creeks in my cup- 
ped hands. They hadn’t objected 
when I was gone for hours. Usually 
I was just sitting on a log and star- 
ing into the sky, and what harm was 
there in that? 

They had encouraged my paint- 
ing. “It’s supposed to be a sign of 
escapism,” Dad said, “but there are 
a lot worse ways of escaping.” He 
made an easel for me, and I used 
tubes of house-paint tint-colors and 
stretched canvas and burlap over 
frames Dad made. He even gave me 
a book of reproductions of the Old 
Masters that he’d saved. 

Life in Woodstock had been plea- 
sant for me, I realized now, even if 
it had often seemed lonely. I could- 
n’t have told the proctor that Fd 
really woken up from a dream about 
Bob before I’d gone out walking. 



Fd seen Bob’s face so clearly, stand- 
ing in the night, unable to say any- 
thing to me. Suddenly it had seemed 
that my voice was stopped too, and 
Fd woken up gasping . 

I boarded a local train, not caring 
that an express would be much fast- 
er, and began the trip back to my 
cubicle at the Statler Dorm. If only 
they hadn’t taken my parents . 

★ ★ ★ 

I had succeeded in setting up a 
makeshift easel in my room at the 
Dorm, and was working on a paint- 
ing, wearing some of Dad’s old 
clothes, when the proctors broke in. 

One of them pointed a small in- 
dicator at me, glanced at it and 
nodded. 

“She’s the one. Instability arid es- 
capism. And look at the kind of 
clothes she wears.” 

“What are you doing?” I whis- 
pered. This was how they’d taken 
my parents! 

“You’re under detention as a 
criminal against society. Miss,” one 
of the proctors said. “We’re all 
sorry.” 

Another one stepped forward and 
held out a hand to me as one might 
a child. “Come along now.” 

**Nor I backed away from them, 
and when they trapped me in the 
comer 1 kicked and screamed at 
them. “Leave me alone, leave me 
alone! You’re killers!” One of them 
grabbed me and held me around my 
waist, my arms pinned to my sides. 

“We’re not killers. Miss,” he said, 
and his voice was incredibly calm, 
“We have nothing to do with it® 



Its 




I twisted free and struck at him, 
tearing skin from his face with my 
nails. "W event my parents enough?** 
One of them pointed another de- 
vice at me, and I blacked out. 

W hen I came to, I was being 
carried by three proctors 
through a door and down a hall. My 
head was fuzzy and throbbing. I 
caught a glimpse of a stenciled sign 
in the corridor, lettered nearly over 
an arrow pointing in the direction 
we were going. The words leaped 
out at me: Execution Arena Floor. 

One of the proctors saw that I 
was conscious and looked down at 
me pleasantly. “No sense struggling 
now,” he said. “It’ll be over soon.” 

I stared back at him for a mo- 
ment, not understanding. But then 
the kindness in his face became clear. 
He pitied me! The pro^stors were 
carrying me as gently as possible, as 
though I were a dog with a broken 
leg. 

I felt incredibly sad, and so tired 
that I was sure 1 must suddenly 
weigh twice as much. But they car- 
ried me through the door and out 
onto the floor of the Arena, and 
there were a thousand people up in 
the dark waiting for me. There were 
floodlights on the chairs where the 
others of the Condemned were strap- 
ped. Thev sat quietly, dully, as 
though they were the Executioners 
and the people above were waiting 
for them to press the buttons. 

But it was insane! How could they 

take it so calmly were they dead 

already? Did they want to die? 



Or was I really insane? Where was 
the sanity in this Arena? 

I couldn’t lie still while they car- 
ried me to that chair. I was fright- 
ened. I was terrified! They were all 
so silent, so calm, so kindly. As 
though nothing at all were happen- 
ing — nothing at all! 

I struggled, trying to fight my 
way free. I kicked and screamed; 
I had to make some noise in that 
black silence. But they held ,me, and 
strapped me into the chair. And 
still there was no sound in the Arena. 

I felt a shock, a tension, and I 
looked up. 

There, in the audience, sitting be- 
fore his little panel with the blue 
light and the red Executioner’s but- 
ton, was a young man staring at me. 

I could feel his stare, like a cool 
hand touching me. It drew me up, 
into the dimness . 

I felt my eyes widen with recog- 
nition. 

*^Bobr I said 

His reply sounded deep inside my 
mind ‘Hello, Rosebud.** 

**l knew you*d be here** I said, 
and then 1 drew him close to me. 

^*lt*s been a long time** 

**Don*t ever forget,** I said, and 
opened myself to him at last. 

T he lights in the Arena dimmed, 
rose, dimmed again. The first 
signal I pressed against the straps, 
but they were firm and unmoving. 
Yet [ — we — leaned forward, and 
watched the panel with its blue light. 
Our stomach was knotted like tight 
leather cords. 



126 




The blue light flashed. I reached 
out a hand to the small red button. 
The straps bit into our flesh. The 
panel was dim, ghostly beneath the 
glaring lights from the dark above. 

A thousand hands touched a 
thousand red buttons. 

One of them was the first to 
touch the button, the first to com- 
plete the circuit. No one knew who 
he was. No one even knew if every 
button was connected, but someone 
touched a button and somewhere 
the circuit was completed. 

Shock! Pain jerked our body rigid! 
We screamed; our skin blistered as 
hair singed and fell away. And there 
was a greater shock, a pain some- 
where else, as our images cleaved 
and I fell away from her. I reached 
out my hand to her, and almost felt 
her touch . but my hand was on 
the button, and she was slumped 
in her chair on the floor of the 
Arena. 

I jerked my hand away from the 
button as though it were hot elec- 
tricity. My whole body was moist 
with perspiration. 

I stared about me, suddenly and 
deeply frightened. Which of us had 
screamed? I’d felt it surging up in 
me, felt it tearing at my throat, burst- 
ing from my mouth — but next to me 
the others were unconcernedly wait- 



ing for me to rise from my seat so 
that we could file in an orderly fash- 
ion from our places in the Arena. 
They had noticed nothing. 

When I stood up my legs were 
trembling. I could still feel where 
the leather straps had bitten into 
them. I stepped carefully up the 
stairs and went out into the morning 
sunshine. Though the floodlights had 
been bright in the Arena, still the 
sunlight hurt my eyes. I paused at 
the door, and looked at my ring- 
watch. It was nine-thirty. Only half 
an hour had passed. 

How long does it take to destroy 
a few spoiled lives? 

It was over. I forced my breathing 
into a more normal rate and step- 
ped onto the sidewalk. Don’t think 
about it, I told myself. After all, it 
had been years earlier that I had 
really lost her . 

I had almost made it to the cor- 
ner when I felt the tap on my shoul- 
der, began to turn, saw the green- 
sleeved arm extending toward me a 
familiar black indicator, and heard 
the proctor say: 

“This is the one. Definite case: 
schizoid condition, latent telepath.” 

“We’re all sorry,” said another of 
them. 

And they led me away to face it 
again END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

Having received and read the 
January issue, I thought that 1 
should write in and let you know 
how well I liked it. The idea of add- 
ing a background tint to the illos 
certainly is an improvement, and 
having the titles printed in red or 
blue makes them stand out much 
better. Hope you can keep it up ... 

Changing the printers is probably 
the greatest improvement that you 
will ever make. It used to be a 
challenge to try to read some of 
the horribly misprinted words. 

The more Virgil ^•Mnlay illos you 
get, the better HI like it. I think 
he^s one of the all-time greats at 
8-f illustration. You could get rid 
of Schelling, though. As an sf art- 
ist he isn't helping to advance the 
cause of science fiction any. His 
work is very poor. 

Since P. Pohl took over If it 
has been on the upswing. Now if it 
only had book reviews . 

Could the new sf mag mentioned 
on page 91 be a companion to //? 
The two titles are very similar — 



Worlds of If and Worlds of To^ 
morrow. If it is, it should be a 
success.

tremendous improvement. Color in-

tyre-face, an extra staple in the 
binding to make for better handling, 
anc for authors: Heinlein, Simak,

And what's more, you announce 
a new sf magazine. Worlds of To^
