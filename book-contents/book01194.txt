LARRY 



THE HOUSE DIVIDED 
I 

He remembered posters. He had 
bought them in a little shop in Kan- 
sas City and taped them to his bed- 
room wall. They had stayed for a 
year before he tired of them: 
blown-up photographs of the planet 
Earth, taken from close orbit and 
from behind the Moon, by Apollo 
astronauts. 

In his memory Earth was all the 
shades of blue, frosted with masses 
and clots of white cloud. Even the 
land was blue tinged with other col- 
ors, except where a rare red- brown 
patch of desert showed through. 

corbell Mark II (Corpsicle Or 
Rebellious Brain-Erasure: Lousy 
Loser) hovered in black space 
within a glowing arc of dials and 
gauges. The youthful body of a 
brain-wiped State criminal was now 
bald and wrinkled and nearly worn 
out, and very thin from its time in 
the cold sleep tank. Stars glared 
around it. Clouds and Sea and de- 
sert landscape raced past three 
hundred miles below. 

It could have been Earth. Even 
the shapes of seas and continents 
seemed vaguely familiar. There was 
far too much reddish-brown in the 
mix . but after all . three mil- 
lion years. He had spent several 
seconds flashing above the 



7 




Swartzchild radius of a black hole 
as massive as a hundred million 
suns. In that time three million 
years had passed. 

★ ★ * 

He tried his voice. It was husky, 
rusty with long sleep, and pitched 
too high. “Is it Earth?” 

"I don’t know,” said Peerssa. 
“Peerssa, that's silly. Is this the 
solar system or isn’t it?” 

“Try not to get excited, Corbell. 
I don’t know if this is Sol system. 
The data conflict. This is the system 
from which came messages. I fol- 
lowed them to their source.” 

“Let’s hear these messages. Why 
didn’t you wake me earlier, before 
we were committed?” 

“We were committed before I 
found the anomalies. I waited until 
we had achieved orbit before I 
woke you. I was afraid you might 
die of the shock. You can’t tolerate 
another spell in cold sleep, Corbell. 
You would not live to reach another 
star. ’ ’ 

Corbell nodded. This last of his 
thawings was the worst yet. It was 
like waking with Asian flu and a 
brandy hangover. He felt sick and 
ugly. Less than ten years ago, by 
the evidence of his memory, the 
State had brought a young man to 
life. Ten years awake, plus a cen- 
tury and a half in cold sleep, had 
left of the young man a withered 
stack of bones. He had grown mor- 
tally afraid of senility . but his 
thoughts seemed clear. 

“Let’s deal with the messages,” 
he said. 

What appeared on the Womb 
Room walls was not quite reality. 

8 



Peerssa controlled those images; 
Peerssa projected what his senses 
picked up from the world below. 
Now Peerssa made a window ap- 
pear in what had been deep space. 
Through the window Corbell saw 
two translucent cubes, slowly rotat- 
ing. Within the cubes were shapes 
and figures formed in much tinier 
cubes — about a hundred per side. 

‘‘A laser was beamed at me 
while I was still thirty-two light 
years distant from this star system,” 
said Peerssa. “There were two sep- 
arate messages, two sequences of 
dots and gaps, each totaling one 
million, thirty thousand, three 
hundred and one bits each. One 
hundred and one cubed. One 
hundred and one is prime. There is 
some ambiguity, of course; I may 
have reversed left for right.” 

It was not the best way to make 
pictures, but Corbell could recog- 
nize a man and a woman holding 
hands ... the same figures in each 
cube. There were polygons of as- 
sorted sizes, in rows, and rough 
spheres. Peerssa created a red neon 
arrow for a pointer. “In your opin- 
ion, are these intended to represent 
human beings?” 

“Sure.” 

“He indicated the similar figures 
in the right-hand cube. “And 
these?” 

“Yes.” 

The arrow returned to the left- 
hand cube. “This was the first mes- 
sage to arrive. These figures may 
represent atoms, carbon and hydro- 
gen and oxygen. Do you agree?” 
“For all of me they do. Why 
would they be there?” 

“They form the basis for protop- 
lasmic chemistry. This bigger row, 



GALAXY 




might it be a solar system? The 
large, nearly spherical hollow object 
would be the sun. The symbols in- 
side may be four hydrogen atoms 
next to a helium atom. The row of 
smaller polygons would be 
planets.” 

“All right. Is it the solar sys- 
tem?” 

“Not unless the solar system has 
changed radically. What about this 
second cube? Why are these human 
figures different from the others?” 

Corbell looked from one to the 
other. In the first message the fi- 
gures were solid, except for hollow 
bubbles to mark the lungs. The 
cubistic figures in the second group 
were hollow, and there was an X of 
small cubes running through them. 
“I think I see. They’re crossed out 
in that second message. And those 
rows of polygons look like eight 
more stellar systems, suns and 
planets, drawn smaller. Some dou- 
ble suns.” 

“What message do you see?” 

“Eight star systems, two with 
double stars. Crossed-out hollow 
people. All right, read it this way. 
‘To whom it may concern. We are 
human, we fit the given model, our 
chemistry is based on carbon and 
water. We come from a star system 
that looks like this. The similar 
people who come from these eight 
other systems look human, but they 
aren’t. Accept no substitutes.’ Does 
that sound right?" 

“I agree.” 

“Well, it’s a very human thing to 
say. I could see your precious State 
sending a message like that, ex- 
cept . except the State didn’t 
have any natural enemies. Everyone 
belonged to the State. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



“So this is the message you fol- 
lowed home?” 

“Yes. I felt that human beings 
must have sent it, and I was not 
sure of finding Sol otherwise.” 
“How did they find us ? Whoever 
sent that beam would have had to 
find us a couple of hundred light 
years out. We were still moving at 
near lightspeed, weren’t we?” 

“The exhaust from a ramship 
would be most conspicuous to the 
right instruments. But the returning 
beam was very powerful. Sending it 
required strong motives.” 

Corbell smiled in evil satisfac- 
tion. “The strongest. Heresy. Your 
State came apart, Peerssa. The col- 
onies revolted. The State around Sol 
must have wanted to warn any re- 
turning starships. Don’t stop at the 
colonies.'’' 

“The State was a water- 
monopoly empire, as you told me. 
Such entities do not die by internal 
revolution. They die only by con- 
quest by an outside force.” 

Corbell laughed. He didn’t like 
the sound: a high-pitched cackle. 
“I’m not a history teacher, Peerssa, 
you idiot! I’m an architect! It was a 
friend who told me about water- 
control empires, and he’s one 
of — he was one of these guys who 
says everything in absolutes because 
it gets more attention. I never knew 
how seriously to take him.” 

“But you believed him.” 

“Oh, a little, but what empire 
ever lasted seventy thousand years? 
If you hadn’t taken me so damn 
seriously, we’d have been 
home . .two million, nine hundred 
and thirty thousand years ago.” 
Corbell was studying the pattern of 
the sun and planets in the left-hand 

9 




cube. “We’re in a system that 
matches that picture?” 

“Yes.” 

There was the sun, then three 
small objects, then a large object 
with a conspicuous lump on it (a 
large moon?), then three medium- 
sized objects . “The Earth isn’t 
there. Otherwise — ” 

“Do you see the body now rising 
beyond this world’s horizon?” 

For a split second Corbell thought 
it was the Moon rising above the 
world’s hazy edge. It was half full. 
It showed bigger than the Moon. It 
glowed in white and orange-white 
bands along the lighted side. What 
should have been the dark side 
glowed just at red heat. 

Peerssa said, “This oxygen- 
atmosphere world we circle is in 
orbit about that larger body. The 
primary is a massive gas giant, hot- 
ter than theory would account for. 
There are other anamolies.” 

“We re in orbit about a moon of 
that thing?” 

“I said that, yes.” 

Corbell’s head whirled. “All 
right, Peerssa. Show me.” 

★ * ★ 

Peerssa showed him, with dia- 
grams and with photographs taken 
during Don Juan’s fiery fall through 
the system. 

The sun was a young red giant, 
swollen and hot: of about one solar 
mass, but with a diameter of ten 
million kilometers. 

Peerssa showed him the inner 
planet next to a map of Mercury. 
Granted the two planets resembled 
each other, but this system’s version 
was scarred and gouged in a differ- 
ent pattern 



The second planet had considera- 
bly less atmosphere than Venus, 
and what there was included some 
oxygen. But it was the right size 
and in the right place. 

There was nothing in Earth’s or- 
bit. 

The third planet remarkably re- 
sembled Mars, but for the lack of 
moons and the great featureless 
mare marring one face. “There are 
curious parallels all through the sys- 
tem,” Peerssa remarked. 

Corbell’s reaction to these revela- 
tions was a slowly mounting anger. 
Had he come home or hadn’t he? 
“Right. Curious. What about 
Earth?” 

A moon much like the Earth cir- 
cled this fourth planet . itself a 
world as massive as Jupiter, but far 
hotter than a world at this distance 
from its primary ought to be, even 
given the hotter sun. It was pouring 
out infrared radiation in enormous 
quantities, and more dangerous 
radiation too. 

“And the other moons? Their or- 
bits would be funny anyway; they’d 
have been altered when the Earth 
was moved into place, if that’s 
Earth.” 

“I thought of that. But I can find 
no moon of this world analogous to 
Ganymede, the biggest of the Jo- 
vian moons.” 

“All right, go on.” 

The fifth planet was an unknown, 
an ice giant in a drunken skewed 
orbit that took it from just inside the 
Jovian’s orbit almost out to the 
sixth planet’s. It was near the Jo- 
vian now, naked-eye visible from 
Don Juan. Peerssa showed him a 
close view of a marble banded in 
pale blues. 



10 



GALAXY 




“This system may be much 
younger than Sol system,” Peerssa 
said. “The skewed orbit of the fifth 
planet has not had time to become 
circular via tidal effects. The Jovian 
is hot because it only recently con- 
densed from the planetary nebula. 
The star has not yet settled down to 
steady burning.” 

“What about this Earthlike 
world? Could it have evolved that 
fast?” 

“No.” 

“I didn’t think so. And that third 
planet looked a lot like Mars. But 
not enough, dammit!” 

“Then observe the sixth.” 

The sixth planet . well, it 
looked like a target. Don Juan had 
crossed nearly over its north pole. 
Nestled within banded white rings 
was the fainter banding of an ice 
giant planet, in very pale blues and 
greens. The oval shadow of the 
planet lay across the rings, render- 
ing the transparent inner ring invisi- 
ble. The sharp-edged rift must be 
Cassini’s Divide, Corbell thought. 
He found other, lesser rifts probably 
caused by tides from smaller 
moons. “Saturn,” he said. 

“It resembles Saturn most re- 
markably. I went to some effort to 
take our course near this sixth 
planet. I tried to find dis- 
crepancies — ” 

“That’s Saturn!” 

“But nothing else matches my 
memory!” 

“Somebody’s been mucking with 
the solar system. Three million 
years. A lot could have happened.” 
“The sun Sol could not have be- 
come a red giant in three million 
years. It is too young. Theory will 
not allow it. Theory does allow a 



similarity in the formation of 
planetary systems.” 

“That is Saturn. And that is 
Earth!” 

“Corbell, is it not possible that 
State citizens settled a moon of a 
Jovian world? Might they have re- 
created Saturn’s rings for nostalgia 
and the love of beauty? You tell 
me. Is the love of beauty that pow- 
erful?” 

It was a strange concept. It had 
its attractions, but . “No. It 
doesn’t hold up. They’d have put 
the rings around the Jovian for a 
better view. And why would they 
build another Mars?” 

“Why would the State destroy 
the topography of Mercury? What 
removed two-thirds of the atmos- 
phere of Venus and changed its 
chemistry? Uranus is missing. 
Ganymede is missing: a body bigger 
than Mercury. A gas giant more 
massive than Neptune orbits nearer 
the sun in a skewed orbit.” 

“That hotter sun could have 
burned away part of Venus’s at- 
mosphere. Mercury . hmmm.” 
“What changed the sun? How 
could the Earth have been moved at 
all? Corbell, I can’t decide!” 

There might have been agony in 
the computer’s voice. Indecision 
was bad for men, but men could 
live with it. A man’s memories 
could fade and grow blurred. But 
not Peerssa’s . 

“They moved the Earth because 
the sun got too hot,” Corbell specu- 
lated. 

“What do you imagine? Did the 
State moor huge rocket motors at 
the North Pole and fuel them with 
Venus’s atmosphere? The ocean 
would have flowed to cover the 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



II 




northern hemisphere! The Earth’s 
surface would have ripped ev- 
erywhere, exposing magma!” 

“I don’t know. I don’t know. 
Maybe they had something besides 
rockets. But that was Mars you 
showed me, and that’s Saturn, and 
that's Earth. There! Couldn’t that 
be the coast of Brazil?” 

“It does not match my memo- 
ry.” With evident reluctance 
Peerssa added, “If other evidence 
were not considered, that shoreline 
could be the edge of the Brazilian 
continental shelf, altered by the 
shifting of tectonic plates.” 

“The ocean must have dropped. 
Maybe some megatons of water 
vapor got left behind when they 
moved the Earth.” 

“The State could not have moved 
the Earth. There would have been 
no need, because Sol was not an in- 
cipient red giant.” 

“Computer! You can’t go against 
your theories, can you? What if we 
were in the ergosphere of a black 
hole longer than we thought? We 
might have lost more than three mil- 
lion years. In tens of millions of 
years, could the sun be a red 
giant?” 

“Nonsense. We would never 
have found Sol at all.” 

That was the last straw, because 
it was true. Corbell was an uncom- 
fortably old man with a cold-sleep 
hangover. “All right,” he said be- 
tween his teeth, “you win the ar- 
gument. Now, for purposes of dis- 
cussion, we are going to assume 
that that planet is Earth. At long 
last we have come home to Earth. 
Now how do I get down?” 

It developed that Peerssa had that 
all figured out. 

12 



II 

Corbell’s pressure suit looked 
clean and new. It was form-fitting, 
with a bulging bulb of a helmet and 
a pointy-ended white spiral on the 
chest. He would not have been sur- 
prised to find it rotted with age. It 
had been waiting for nearly two 
hundred years, ship's time. 

He went out the airlock with the 
suspicion that he was going to his 
death. He had never done this be- 
fore . and in fact the suit held up 
better than he did. Panting, perspir- 
ing, with his pulse thundering ir- 
regularly in his ears, he maneuvered 
himself at the end of a tether and 
turned for a look at Don Juan. 

The silver finish had dulled. Cor- 
bell winced at the sight of a gaping 
hole in one of the probes. Peerssa 
had never mentioned a meteor 
strike. It could as easily have hit the 
life support system. 

Four of the probes were missing. 

The biological package probes 
were what made Don Juan a seeder 
ramship. Each of the probes held a 
spectrum of algaes with which to 
seed the unbreathable reducing at- 
mosphere of some nearby Earthlike 
world, to turn the atmosphere into 
breathable air and the world into a 
potential colony. Of course they had 
never been used for that purpose. 
Deprived in detail of his civil 
rights, Corbell had stolen the ship 
and lit out for the galactic core. 

There had been ten probes 
mounted around Don Juan’s waist. 
Now there were six. “I ran the on- 
board hydrogen tank nearly 
empty,” Peerssa explained. “I had 
to use four of the thrust systems in 
the probes to make orbit around 



GALAXY 




Earth. Afterward I put the probes in 
orbits as relay satellites. You will 
be able to call me from the surface, 
wherever you are.” 

“Good.” 

“How do you feel? Can you sur- 
vive a re-entry?” 

“Not yet. I’m out of shape. Give 
me a month.” 

“You’ll have it. You’ll have 
exercise too. We must make ready 
one of the probes for your des- 
cent.” 

“I’m going down in one of 
those?” 

“They are designed to enter an 
atmosphere. Don Juan is not.” 

“I should have thought of that. I 
never did figure a safe way to get 
down. Aren’t you coming down 
yourself?” 

“Not unless you so order.” 

Small wonder if he sounded re- 
luctant. It came to Corbell that 
Peerssa’s body was the ship. He 
could be a total paraplegic if he 
survived reentry. Corbell said, 
“Thomas Jefferson freed his slaves 
on his death. Can I do less? After 
I’m down, living or dead, mag- 
nanimously I free you from all or- 
ders previous or subsequent.” 

“Thank you, Corbell.” 

He had trained to work in a pres- 
sure suit — while suspended in a 
magnetic field, not in actual free 
fall — but that was long ago, and he 
had trained in a young body. The 
work was hard. On the second day 
he hurt everywhere. On the third he 
was back at work. He would stop 
only when Peerssa insisted. 

“We won’t try to build you a life 
support system,’’ Peerssa said. 
“We’ll put what you need in the 
capsule with you and fill the cap- 



sule with plastic foam. Your suit 
will be your life support system.” 

But even that involved moving 
large masses, and manhandling the 
bulky cutting laser for hours at a 
time. The algae tanks and the 
machinery that served them had to 
be removed in inspection-hatch- 
sized pieces. Corbell dared not rip 
the hull. His life could depend on 
its integrity. 

He needed long rest periods. He 
spent them in the Womb Room, 
watching films of Don Juan's entry 
into what Peerssa now called 
(rightly or wrongly) the solar sys- 
tem. 

For a computer, Peerssa had been 
starkly ingenious. Corbell would not 
have thought of using the package 
probes as thrusters. Peerssa had al- 
most failed to find Earth at all; for 
the big new moon of the red hot gas 
giant Peerssa now called Jupiter was 
just outside the band where Peerssa 
was searching for a habitable 
planet. Peerssa had nearly departed 
Sol with Corbell still in cold sleep, 
to search nearby systems for rem- 
nants of the State. 

Corbell would probably have died 
en route. 

Apparently the question of where 
they were no longer bothered 
Peerssa. It had only required Cor- 
bell’s order to stop his worrying 
about it. But at the time, Corbell 
gathered, Peerssa was frantic. He 
had used fuel he couldn’t spare to 
make close flybys past Saturn and 
Mercury. 

Now Corbell looked down at the 
Earth and yearned. “All the mis- 
takes I made, and still I got here. 
The mistakes all canceled. If I 
hadn’t turned the receiver back on 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE

you couldn’t have beamed your per- 
sonality into the computer. I’d have 
wrecked the ship trying to run all 
the way at one gravity. If I’d been 
right about the galactic core I’d 
have died of old age, that far from 
home. It’s like something led me 
back here.” 

‘‘Your records call you an agnos- 
tic.” 

“Yeah. I’m whistling in the dark. 
I keep thinking I’ll just barely get 
killed landing.” 

He was taking a long rest period 
in celebration. He had finally 
finished cleaning debris out of the 
probe warhead. With a meal in his 
hand — a layered sandwich baked 
like a cake — he watched the land- 
scape roll below him. A dull red 
highlight gleamed on the nightside 
ocean, below Jupiter. 

‘‘Where do I want to land? Is 
there any sign of civilization down 
there?’ ’ 

‘‘I detect generation and use of 
power in three places.” On the 
huge blue face of the planet a green 
arrow suddenly pointed at a green 
grid pattern. ‘‘Here, and on the 
other side of the world, and in An- 
tarctica. My orbit does not cover 
Antarctica, but I can land you 
there.” 

“No, thanks. Isn’t that just about 
California?” Thinking: wait a min- 
ute, the west coast ought to bulge. 
And where’s Baja California? From 
what seemed to be mid-Mexico the 
coast was a convex sweep all the 
way up to what must be Alaska. 

‘‘Most of what you called 
California and Baja California will 
be an island near the North Pole. I 
can land you there too.” 

‘‘No. Wherever someone is 



generating power, that’s where I 
want to land. There, where you put 
the grid pattern . which looks a 
little like a city, doesn’t it? Right 
angles ...” 

“There are many clustered build- 
ings, yes, but no strong evidence of 
pre-planning. Your era would have 
called it a city. I advise against 
your landing there.” 

“If they’re the ones who sent the 
messages, they probably won’t kill 
me. I served their ancestral State.” 
It might be Nevada, he thought, or 
Arizona — it was on the seacoast 
now. 

‘‘The differences between — ” 
Peerssa stopped. 

Corbell got angry. “That’s Earth. 
Earth!” The screwed-up solar sys- 
tem bothered him too, when he let 
it. “Peerssa, that was Earth’s plate 
tectonics you were describing! Did 
you find the island that used to be 
California?” 

“I found two islands that might 
have been California, three million 
years ago.” 

“Well, then! Did that happen by 
coincidence?” 

“No,” Peerssa lied. 

“Call that area where you put the 
grid One City. Call the Antarctic 
area Three City. What about Two 
City? Where is that?” 

“Bordering the Sea of Okhotsk in 
Russia.” 

‘‘Land me in One City, then.” 
More calmly he added, “I must be 
nuts, looking for civilization. Why 
do I want to spend my last days 
fighting a foreign language? But 
maybe I’ll have time to find out 
what happened here.” 

Now Corbell filled the probe nose 
cone with medicines, food, a tank 



14 



GALAXY 




of fresh water, tanks of oxygen, a 
radio. The plastic foam would hold 
them. He moored more solidly the 
ultrasonic whistle, that would melt 
the foam controlled by signal from 
Peerssa. 

He had put on muscle weight. 
The heart attack he feared, and 
thought he was prepared for, had 
never come. Don Juan’s twenty- 
second-century medicines had given 
him that. But he lived with hot 
wires in his shoulders: tendonitis. 

At the last — braced in the middle 
of the ravaged nose compartment, 
with one hand on the spigot of the 
foam tank — he hesitated. “Peerssa? 
Can you hear me?” 

“Yes.” 

“What will you do after I’m 
down?” 

“I will wait until I am sure you 
are dead. Then I will search other 
systems for the State.” 

“You’re no crazier than I am.” 
He wondered how long Peerssa ex- 
pected him to last . and didn’t 
ask. He opened the spigot. Foam 
surrounded him and congealed. 

Thrust built up under his back, 
held for a time, then eased to al- 
most nothing. Presently there was 
turbulence. It was a powered land- 
ing, not a meteoric re-entry. The 
thrust built up again, held, died. 
The probe rotated . and there 
was a jar that drove him two inches 
into the foam. 

Peerssa spoke in his suit radio. 
“May I consider myself free of 
your commands?” 

Corbell suffered a quick, vividly 
detailed nightmare. “Melt the foam 
first!” he cried. But Peerssa was no 
longer bound by his orders. Peerssa 
would take vengeance on one whom 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



the State considered a criminal and 
arch-ingrate. The foam would not 
melt. Corbell would die here, em- 
bedded like a fly in amber, his 
freedom mere yards away! 

He felt a lurch. Then another. 
The nightmare ended. He sank 
through melting foam, blind, to a 
solid bulkhead. The foam ran from 
his faceplate, and he saw that the 
inspection hatch was wide open. 

Corbell stepped into the opening 
and looked out and down. 

Peerssa had landed the big cylin- 
der on its side, on attitude jets. The 
sun, high overhead, was nonetheless 
a sunset sun, red and inflated. The 
land ran flat to a range of sharp- 
edged granite hills. It was all dead: 
browns and grays, dead rock and 
dust. Heat made the air shimmer 
like water. 

The State had not provided exit 
ladders for a package probe. Peerssa 
had been clever again. The foam 
had run out the hatch and congealed 
into a foam plastic slope. Corbell 
walked down it, and his boots 
crunched, as on snow partly thawed 
and refrozen. He stepped out onto 
the soil of Earth. 

The soil had died. 

Three million years. Wars? Ero- 
sion? Loss of water when Earth fled 
inexplicably from an inexplicably 
expanding sun? 

At this moment he didn’t care. 
He raised hands to his faceplate — 
“Do not try to take off your suit. 
Corbell, have you left the 
probe?” — ready for his first breath 
of fresh air in a long time. 

“Why not?” 

“Have you left the probe?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Good. For purposes of discus- 

15 




sion I have spoken of this world as 
Earth. Now I may speak of the dif- 
ferences. You have landed on a 
world marginally habitable at best, 
in a region uninhabitably hot.” 
“What?” 

“It’s too hot, Corbell. Tempera- 
tures in the equatorial zone range 
from fifty-five degrees centigrade 
upward. The oceans are above fifty 
degrees. 1 find little chlorophyll ab- 
sorption in the oceans, and none on 
land, barring certain mountain val- 
leys. You would have done better to 
land near one or the other pole.” 
Somehow Corbell was not even 
shocked. Had he been half- 
expecting this? My death is the end 
of the world — a very human at- 
titude. And three million years, 
after all — “So that’s what happened 
to the oceans. Evaporated.” 

“The atmosphere holds great 
quantities of water vapor. Corbell, 
we still do not know.” 

“What about mountain valleys?” 
“In a mountain range correspond- 
ing to Earth’s Himalayas, there are 
valleys between one and two 
kilometers high. Some life has sur- 
vived there.” 

Corbell sighed. “All right. 
Which way is civilization?” 

“Define civilization.” 

“One City. No, just point me at 
the closest place where someone is 
using power.” 

“Four point nine kilometers dis- 
tant there is minor usage of power. 
I doubt you will find people, or 
even living beings. The power level 
has not varied since we made orbit. 
I think you will find nothing but 
machines running automatically.” 
“I’ll try anyway. Which way?” 
“West. I will guide you.” 



Ill 



Corbell had not gone hiking in a 
long time. 

The suit was not uncomfortable. 
Most of the weight of equipment 
rested on his shoulders. The boots 
were not hiking boots, but they fit. 
He set out in a rhythmic stride, breath- 
ing the canned air, letting his at- 
tention rove the scenery . and 
had to stop very soon. He’d chosen 
too quick a pace. 

He rested, then set out in a more 
leisurely stroll. It was level land: 
not ankle-breaking country, though 
he had to watch his footing. It was 
packed earth with rocks inset, and 
there were gentle wind-carved ris- 
ings and fallings-off. 

Peerssa led him to the range of 
hills and apparently expected him to 
walk straight across them. Corbell 
turned left until he could find an 
easier slope. He found he was 
grumbling subvocally . 

He had had to grumble subvoc- 
ally for lo, these eight years waking 
time in which he had grown one 
hundred and eighty years old while 
three million years passed on Earth. 
Grumble aloud and you couldn’t 
know what Peerssa might pick up 
and take as an order. Goddam lit- 
eral computers, he grumbled. Sleep 
tanks and super-medicines that don’t 
keep you young. Air and cooling 
equipment getting heavier with each 
step. Why couldn’t they have put a 
belly band in this suit? A belly band 
was the greatest invention since the 
wheel. It let a hiker carry the 
weight on his hips instead of his 
back. If the State had had its head 
screwed on right — 



16 



GALAXY 




Which was silly. The suit was 
designed for free-fall and use 
aboard ship. Not hiking. And if 
Peerssa took orders, it was a damn 
good thing. And he was lucky to be 
on Earth at all. And, Corbell 
thought as he topped the crest, he 
was damn glad to be here. Puffing, 
bent over so he could pant better, 
half-listening for the heart attack 
he’d been expecting for so long, it 
came to him that he was happy. 

Yeah! In three million years, 
probably no human being had ever 
done what he had done. Be nice if 
there were someone to brag to. 

He saw the house. 

It was on a higher crest of hills 
beyond this one. Otherwise he 
might not have seen it. It was just 
the color of the hills: gray and 
dust-brown; but he saw its regular 
shape against the blue of sky. It 
was set against the rock slope. 

It took him another two hours to 
reach it. He was being careful with 
himself. Even so, he knew how his 
legs would hurt tomorrow, if there 
was a tomorrow. He was two-thirds 
of the way up that second range of 
hills when he found the remains of 
a broken road. Then it was easier. 

The house was extravagantly de- 
signed. The roof was a convex 
triangle, almost horizontal, with the 
base against the hill itself. Below 
the roof were two walls of glass, or 
of something stronger. The house's 
single room was exposed to this 
single voyeur, who perched precari- 
ously on the slope and clutched at a 
boulder with thick gloves. It was, 
he thought, a hell of a place to 
build a house. 

He pressed his faceplate against 
the glass-like material. 



The floor was not quite level. 
Either the hill itself had settled, or 
architectural styles had changed 
more than the architect in Corbell 
was willing to believe. 

He was looking into a living- 
room-sized area with what had to be 
a bed in the middle. But the bed 
was two or three times bigger than 
king size, and it had the extravagant 
shape of a ’60s style Hollywood 
pool. The curved headboard was a 
control board fitted with screens and 
toggles and hi-fi grids and a couple 
of slots big enough to deliver drinks 
or sandwiches. In the darkness 
above the bed hovered a big wire 
sculpture or a mobile or even some 
kind of antenna; he couldn’t tell. 

But two pinpricks of yellow light 
lived in the control board. 

“This is your power source, all 
right,’’ Corbell reported. “I’m 
going to find the door.” 

Twenty minutes later he reported, 
“There’s no door.” 

“A house must have an open- 
ing.” Peerssa replied “Look for an 
opening that doesn’t look like a 
doOr. From your description, there 
must be more to the house than you 
can see: a toilet at least, perhaps an 
office or a food dispensary.” 
“They’d have to be under the 
hill. Mmm ... all right. I’ll keep 
looking.” 

There was no trace of a trap door 
in the roof. Could the whole roof 
lift up in one piece, on signal? Cor- 
bell couldn’t guess whether the ar- 
chitect would have been that waste- 
ful of power. 

If there was an entrance in the 
road itself, then hard dirt covered it. 
Corbell was getting annoyed. The 
house couldn’t have been used in a 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



17 




hundred years; possibly a thousand; 
conceivably, ten thousand. Likewise 
the door, wherever it might be. 
Maybe the house had a second, 
lower story, now buried in the hill, 
door and all. 

“I’ll have to break in,” he said. 

“Wait, Corbell. Might the house 
have a burglar alarm? I am not 
familiar with the design concepts 
regarding private dwellings. The 
State built arcologies.” 

“What if it does have a burglar 
alarm? I’m wearing a helmet. I 
can’t hear a damn thing through 
it.” 

“There might be more than bells. 
Let me attack the house with my 
message laser.” 

“Will it — ” Will it reach? 
Stupid, it was designed to reach 
across tens of light-years. “Go 
ahead.” 

“I have the house in view. Fir- 
ing.” 

Looking down on the triangular 
roof from his post on the roadway, 
Corbell saw no beam; but he saw a 
spot the size of a manhole cover 
turn red hot. 

He saw earth below him trying to 
move. A ton or so of hillside spilled 
away from below the house, and a 
thing of rusted metal floated out on 
a whispering air cushion. It was the 
size of a dishwasher, with a head: a 
basketball with an eye in it. The 
head rolled, and a scarlet beam the 
thickness of Corbell’s arm pierced 
the clouds. 

“Peerssa, you’re being attacked. 
Can you handle it?” 

“It can’t hurt me. It could hurt 
you. I’d better destroy it.” 

The metal thing began to glow. It 
didn’t like that. It fled away in a 

18 



jerky randomized path, while the 
red beam remained fixed on one 
point in the sky. Its upper body 
glowed bright red verging on 
orange. It was screaming; its frantic 
warbling voice sang through Cor- 
bell’s helmet. Suddenly it tilted and 
arced away down the hill. It struck 
the plain hard, turned over and over 
and lay silent. 

There was a hole in the roof 
now. Corbell said, “You think 
there are more of those?” 

“Insufficient data.” 

Corbell climbed down to the roof 
and looked through. Molten con- 
crete, or whatever, had set the bed 
afire. Corbell jumped down onto the 
flaming bedclothes, prepared to get 
off fast. Wrong again: it was a 
water bed, and his feet went right 
through it. He waded out, then 
pushed the burning bedclothes into 
the puddle in the middle with his 
clumsy gloved hands. The fire went 
out, but the room filled with steam. 

“I’m in the house,” he reported. 
Peerssa didn’t bother to answer. 

Corbell the architect looked about 
him. 

This room, the visible part of the 
house, was a triangle. The bed in 
the center had the pleasing asym- 
metry of a puddle of water . and 
it was pleasing. There was an arc of 
sofa in one comer, facing the bed, 
and a slab of black slate in front of 
it, arced like the sofa and broken in 
the middle, as if . Corbell bent 
and lifted one end of the slab. 
Yeah, something on the underside, 
solid circuitry. This had been a 
floating coffee table until whatever 
was holding it up burned out. 

From inside he could still see no 
doors. 



GALAXY 




There was only one wall to in- 
spect. He moved along it, rapping. 
It all sounded hollow. 

Door controls on the headboard? 
Nuts. You’d have to walk clear 
around to the other side . wait, 
there were pressure points on the 
back side. Three of them. He 
pushed them. 

The back wall slid down in three 
unequal sections. 

The big one was a closet. There 
were half a dozen half-rotted gar- 
ments in it, and heaped dust. The 
second was a much smaller closet, 
no bigger than a telephone booth, 
with a freeform chair in it. 

A chair. Funny. Corbell went 
close enough to see the great hole 
in the bottom of the chair. A toilet? 
But there was no water in the bowl, 
and no toilet paper, except . .ex- 
cept for a glitteringly clean metal 
sponge attached to the chair by a 
wire. 

He stepped out of the cubical. By 
any terms, it was pretty basic for a 
house with this complexity of de- 
sign. The owner should have been 
able to afford something better. 

The closet ... He tugged at the 
clothes still hanging on shaped han- 
gers. Funny, he couldn’t tell if they 
were made for a man or a woman. 
They were amazingly resilient. He 
tugged harder, then tried in earnest 
to tear the half-rotted things. They 
stood his full strength. 

So. Say there were temporary 
clothes, meant to change with style, 
and clothes meant to last longer. 
The heaps of dust would be the 
temporary clothes . 

He still hadn’t found a door. 

The third cubicle looked promis- 
ing. There was nothing in it at all 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



except for one unmarked switch like 
the door switch in the bathroom, 
and a panel of four lighted pushbut- 
tons each with a different squiggle 
on it. 

“I think I’ve found an elevator,” 
he said. “I’m going to try it.” He 
used the door switch. The door 
came up; he turned on his helmet 
lamp. 

“Dangerous. What if the elevator 
takes you down and then breaks 
down?” 

“Then you beam me another 
manhole to climb out of.” Corbell 
pushed the top button. Nothing 
happened. 

He’d expected that. He was at the 
top. He pushed #2. 

“Corbell! Answer if you can!” 

“Yeah?” There had been no 
sense of motion. He opened the 
door. 

“You have changed position by 
four point one miles southwest and 
two hundred feet loss of altitude. I 
place you in One City.” 

“Yeah.” Corbell looked out into 
a different room. He was beginning 
to feel like a wandering ghost. Ev- 
erything was spooky, unreal. 

He stepped out, around what 
must have been a floating desk and 
was now at the height of his knees. 
Screens and pushbutton panels set 
into the desk made it look like the 
control panel in the Womb Room; 
but they were ruined. It must have 
rained here for hundreds of years. 

There was a mg like half-melted 
cotton candy, deep as his ankles. It 
squished beneath his boots, and 
tore, and stuck to his suit fabric. He 
stepped to the edge of an empty pic- 
ture window frame and looked out. 

Thirty stories of windows and 

19 




empty frames dropped away beneath 
his toes. He saw far higher build- 
ings around him. There to the right, 
a masonry behemoth had fallen, tak- 
ing other buildings and pieces of 
buildings with it. Beyond that gap, 
beyond the mist and rain, he 
thought he could trace a grey-on- 
grey outline: a cube, impossibly 
large, whose walls had a slight 
outward curve. 

Afraid of falling, he lay on his 
back to look up. He found another 
sixty or seventy stories of building 
above him. 

“Did the State ever have any 
kind of instant transportation? Like 
a telephone booth, but you dial and 
you’re there?” 

“No.” 

“Well, these people did. I should 
have guessed. Me, of all people! 
That house wasn’t a house, it was 
only part of a house. I’ve found the 
office. It’s in the city. There ought 
to be a bathroom and a living room 
and maybe a game room, God 
knows where. What we broke into 
was the bedroom.” 

“It’s likely that the machinery 
has not been tended for a long time. 
Bear that in mind.” 

There were two panels in the 
instant-elsewhere booth: a four- 
button set like the one in the bed- 
room, and an eight-button set with 
squiggles printed on the buttons. 
Now, what did that mean? He set- 
tled for pushing the third down on 
the four-button set. 

Now there was a light working in 
the cubicle, and no second panel. 
Corbell stepped out, and smiled. 
Definitely, this was the bathroom. 

And the outside temperature re- 
gister, set a chin level beneath the 

20 



edge of his faceplate, was dropping. 

“I think there’s air condition- 
ing,” he said. 

“You have traveled three point 
one miles west by southwest and 
have lost six hundred feet of al- 
titude.” 

“Yeah." Corbell opened his 
faceplate. Just for a moment, he’d 
slam it fast if — But the air was cool 
and fresh. 

He began taking off his suit. 

It came to him as he let the 
heavy backpack section fall: he was 
exhausted. He pulled himself out of 
the rest of his armor and stepped 
down into a bathtub almost big 
enough to be called a pool. 

He couldn’t read the markings on 
the water spigot. He turned it all the 
way one way and pulled it on. Hot 
water splashed into the tub. He 
turned it the other way. Boiling 
water spurted out, spitting steam. 

Okay, the hot water was “Cold”, 
and it wasn’t too hot to stand. It 
flooded out and around him as he 
lolled on the curved bottom. 

A tiny voice called, “Corbell, 
answer!” 

He reached and pulled the helmet 
to the edge. “I’m taking a rest 
break. Check back in an hour. And 
send me a dancing girl.” 

IV 

A tiny voice peeped, “ — Can. 
Repeating. Corbell, answer if you 
can. Repeating. Corbell — ” 

Corbell opened his eyes. 

Every texture was strange to his 
sight and his touch. He was 
nowhere aboard Don Juan. Then 
where — ? 

Ah. He’d found two projections 

GALAXY 




at the edge of the sunken tub, soft 
mounds like a pair of falsies, just 
right to rest his head. His neck was 
still between the pillows. Lukewarm 
water enveloped him. He’d gone to 
sleep in the tub. 

“ — if you can. Repeat — ” 

Corbel! pulled the pressure suit 
helmet to him. “Here.” 

“Your hour’s gone, and another 
hour and six minutes. Are you 
sick?” 

“No, just sleepy. Hang on.” He 
pulled the spigot on. Hot water 
spurted through cool water and 
mixed. Corbell stirred with his foot. 
“I’m still on a rest break. Anything 
new at your end?” 

“Something’s watching me. I 
sense radar and gravity radiation.” 
"Gravity?" 

“Gravity waves going through 
my mass sensor, yes. I’m being 
probed by advanced instruments 
which must have learned a great 
deal- about me. They could be au- 
tomatic.” 

“They could also be from the 
same source as the messages. 
Where is all this action coming 
from?” 

“From what would be Tasmania, 
if this were Earth. — The probing 
has stopped. I can’t see the 
source.” 

“If it starts throwing missiles at 
you you’ll have to pull out fast.” 
“Yes. I’ll have to change my or- 
bit. I didn’t want to use the fuel. 
My orbit does not take me over An- 
tarctica.” 

“Do that.” Corbell stood up (his 
legs ached) and waded dripping 
from the warm water. A line of 
thick dust against the base of a wall 
might have been the remains of to- 



wels. He stopped before a picture 
window. 

The day had darkened. He looked 
down across a shallow slope of 
beach sand, downhill into haze that 
thickened to opaque mist. Was that 
a . fish skeleton down there, 
glimmering white through haze? It 
looked far distant . and big. 

Lightning flared, waited, flared 
again. 

The rain fell like an avalanche. 

Corbell turned away. He put on 
his undersuit, then his pressure suit 
piece by piece, feeling the weight 
and the chafe spots. The bath had 
been good. He’d have to come back 
here when he got the chance. There 
was even a sauna, not that he’d 
need — 

Yeah, a sauna. This place was 
old. If it had been built after the 
Earth had grown hot, the sauna 
would have been a door to the out- 
side! 

He went into the booth, dith- 
ered, and decided not to push 
the bottom button. Peerssa was 
right. The machinery had been un- 
tended for a long time. 

So: Bedroom or Office? He knew 
those circuits still worked. 

Bedroom. 

He stepped out. Next to his chin 
the temperature readout rose in 
blinking numerals. He stepped 
around to the headboard, confirmed 
a memory: he’d seen a television 
screen, and controls. 

He turned it on. The screen lit, 
first grey-white, then — 

It was a view of the ruined bed, 
showing his own armored legs. 

He tried switches until he found 
the playback. The scene ran back- 
ward. Suddenly the bed was whole 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



21 




and four figures writhed on it at 
flickering speed. The scene jumped 
to a different foursome or to the 
same foursome dressed differently, 
before he found a way to freeze it. 

“Corbel 1, I have tried to signal 
the source of the probes, to no ef- 
fect.” 

“Okay. Listen, if you have to 
run, just do it. We’ll both be safer 
if you don’t stop to call me about 
it.” 

“What will you do now?” 

“I’m watching home movies.” 
Corbell chortled. “This place is like 
the Playboy Mansion. There’s an 
invisible video camera focused on 
the bed.” 

“A degenerate civilization, then. 
Small wonder they could not save 
themselves. You should not degrade 
yourself by watching.” 

Corbell swallowed his annoyance. 
“I want to know if they’re hu- 
man.” 

“Are they?” 

“The tape’s faded. And they're 
wearing clothes., loose suits with 
lots of openings in them, in pastels. 
If they aren’t human I can’t see the 
differences . but they’re thin. 
And they don’t seem to carry them- 
selves right.” He paused to watch. 
“And they’re very limber. The situ- 
ation isn’t quite what I thought.” 

“In what way?” 

“1 thought it was an orgy for 
four. It isn’t. It's like in ancient 
China: two of them are servants. 
They’re helping the other pair get 
into those advanced sexual posi- 
tions. Maybe they’re not servants; 
maybe they’re trainers, or 
teachers.” He watched some more. 
“Or even . they’re as limber as 
dancers. Maybe that’s what they 

22 



are. I wish I had a view of the 
couch. There might be spectators.” 
“Corbell.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Are you hungry?” 

“. Yeah. I may have to use 
that fourth button.” 

“I wouldn’t bother. If a 
thousand-year-old kitchen is your 
only food source, you’ll die quick- 
ly. Your suit will only recycle air for 
another seventy-one hours. Your 
food-syrup reserve is trivial. I 
suggest you try to reach the South 
Pole. I am over it now. I see a 
large continental mass, and forest.” 
“Well, fine." Corbell switched 
off the stag movie and made for the 
closet. 

When he punched the second but- 
ton down, a panel of eight buttons 
appeared beside the smaller panel. 

He studied it. The symbols on 
those eight buttons might be letters 
or numbers. He reached, then drew 
back. “I’m afraid of it.” 

"Of what?” 

“Of this panel in the office. See, 
the four buttons that were in all the 
booths are probably an intercom. A 
closed circuit; you couldn’t get into 
it except from here. There’s prob- 
ably a private number that lets you 
into the office. This panel in the of- 
fice booth is like a telephone, I 
think. What happens when you dial 
a phone number at random?” 

“In my time there was a recorded 
voice to tell you you had made a 
mistake.” 

“Yeah, we had that too. But in 
this instant transportation setup you 
might be sent nowhere! Poof l" 

“Can you find a telephone direc- 
tory?" 

There was nothing like that in the 

GALAXY 





booth. Corbel] opened the door. 

Rain and howling wind were 
blowing into the office. Fat drops 
plated themselves across his facep- 
late. He walked around the desk, 
waited a minute for the water to run 
off the glass, then began pulling at 
desk drawers. They didn’t want to 
open. He pried one open and found 
it half full of gray-green mold. An 
abandoned apple? 

Machines were set into the desk 
top. Telephone, picture-phone, 
computer link, what? No telling 
now. Time and rain had destroyed 
them. 

“I’ll have to try pushing buttons 
at random,” he told Peerssa. 

“Good luck.” 

“Why did you say that?” 

“To be polite.” 

Corbell faced the array of eight 
buttons in the light from his helmet. 
The booth could kill him so fast 
he’d never know it. Punch at ran- 
dom? He could do better than that. 
He chose a button — the fifth, count- 
ing across and down, and the sym- 
bol looked like an upside-down L. 
A gallows. He pushed it once, 
pause, twice, pause, thrice . 

Four did it. Suddenly there was 
indirect lighting around the rim of 
the ceiling. 

The door wouldn’t open. 

Annoyed, he chose another but- 
ton, an hourglass on its side and 
compressed from both ends: 
4 - 4 - 4 - 4 . 

“You have changed position 
twice,” Peerssa informed him. 

This time the door opened. 

There were skeletons, very old 
skeletons in identical . uniforms? 
Loose garments, short pants, sleeve- 
less shirts with rolls of fabric at the

shoulders. Under the dust the gar- 
ments looked new, in bright scarlet 
with black markings. The bones in- 
side were crumbled with age, but 
they could not have been big men. 
Five feet tall or thereabouts. Corbell 
moved among them looking for bul- 
let wounds. No holes in the gar- 
ments or the skulls . but from 
the way they sprawled they seemed 
to have died in a firefight, and they 
seemed to be human. 

He found desks and what looked 
like computer terminals. A thick 
sliding door had been melted out of 
the wall. Beyond it were cells, 
whose walls and doors were com- 
posed of lacy, decorative grid work 
that was different for each cell; but 
the metal-lace doors were locked, 
and there were more skeletons in 
the cells. 

“Police station,” he told Peerssa. 
“I was trying for a restaurant. I 
pushed the same button four 
times.” He heard irritation in his 
voice. Was he getting tired? “See, 
what I didn’t want was a number 
that went nowhere. The numbers 
the restaurants fight for are the ones 
that are easiest to remember. Or 
they used to be.” 

“The State restricts those num- 
bers to important municipal func- 
tions; police stations, hospitals, 
ombudsmen — ” 

Corbell stepped through another, 
larger melted door. Doors beyond 
retracted before him, and he stepped 
into a waterfall of rain. He’d finally 
made it outside. He couldn’t see 
much. A city street . and more 
skeletons. These wore varied cloth- 
ing, skimpy shorts-and-undershirt 
garments in every color and pattern 
save scarlet. 



“I’ll have to try the other repeat- 
ing numbers,” he said without mov- 
ing. 

“I think it is safe. If you find a 
number not in use, it won’t work.” 

“You’re willing to risk that, 
huh?” He still hadn’t moved. The 
rain ran down his faceplate and 
drummed on his helmet. 

“There is an alternative. I have 
probed the city with my senses. 
There is hollow space, a system of 
tunnels underground, leading away 
in many directions. I can lead you 
to the underground space where 
they converge.” 

“What’s the point of . You 
think it’s a subway system? They’d 
have stopped using it when they in- 
vented the booths.” 

“If they no longer used the sub- 
way cars, they may have kept the 
buildings as a transportation nexus. 
Economy.” 

V 

He walked through pelting rain 
on packed dirt covered by thin mud. 
It sucked at his boots. He couldn’t 
afford the energy that cost him. He 
was already too tired . 

The streets and buildings were 
largely intact. He found no more 
piles of skeletons. 

There was a bubble, half glass 
and half metal, like a Christmas or- 
nament twelve feet across. It was 
smashed against the side of a build- 
ing and half filled with rainwater. 
Corbell looked inside. He found 
spongy upholstery, and a pair of 
seats, one occupied by another 
small disintegrating skeleton in a 
yellow shorts-and-undershirt gar- 
ment. Corbell forced himself to 
search through the big patch pock- 



24 



GALAXY 




cts. What he found, he stowed in 
his too] pouch. He could examine it 
later. 

Later there was an intact bubble, 
abandoned. He tried to start it. It 
looked intact; the brightwork in the 
interior gleamed. But it was dead. 

He walked on. Now there was a 
tremendous empty lot on one side, 
with wind-weathered stumps of tree 
and traces of curving paths. A park? 
On his other side was a wall that 
went up and up, curving away from 
view, and on and on, curving later- 
ally as well, so that he had no idea 
how high it was nor how wide. 

In the mists beyond the office 
picture window he had thought to 
trace the outlines of a cube bigger 
than belief. So: it had been real. 

Streets. Why streets? And cars? 
Corbell began to suspect what he 
would find at the transportation 
nexus. 

“You are over the hollow 
space,’’ said Peerssa. 

“That’s good. I’m tired.” Cor- 
bell looked around him. Mummified 
park to the left, wall to the right. 
Ahead ... the wall turned to glass. 

An entire wall of glass doors. He 
pushed through into gloom lit by his 
helmet lamp. 

The ceiling gave no sense of dis- 
tance: only of random colors that 
changed with his position. The 
place was wide. His beam got lost 
in it. He glanced down at another, 
confusing light: the glow of dials at 
his chin. 

The temperature was down to 20° 
C. 

“Air conditioned,” he said. 

“Good. Your suit batteries will 
last longer.” 

“There could be anything in this 



place,” he argued with himself. He 
opened his faceplate. No heat. Snif- 
fed: a touch of staleness, that was 
all. “I’ve got to get out of this suit. 
I’m tired.” 

“Drink from the syrup nipple.” 

He laughed; he’d forgotten it was 
there. He sucked until his belly felt 
less empty. Peerssa was right: half 
of his tiredness had been hunger. 

He pulled himself out of the rest 
of the suit. 

Stepping into the rug was a sud- 
den, thrilling shock. It might be the 
same as the rotted rug in the office, 
but it was dry, intact, and ankle 
deep. Like walking on a cloud. It 
felt damned expensive, but there 
must have been an acre of it here in 
the foyer of a public building. 

“Going to sleep,” he told the 
helmet. He sprawled out in the 
cloud of carpet and let it close 
around him. 

VI 

Grey dawn. He wriggled a little 
in the luxury of the rug. The ceiling 
was thousands of shades of color in 
what seemed to be whorl patterns; 
you could go crazy staring into it 
and never know how far away it 
was. He closed his eyes and dozed 
again. 

Came down to die, he thought. 
He said, “Peerssa, how do you ex- 
pect me to die? Heart Attack?” 

No answer. The helmet was out 
there by his fingertips. He pulled it 
close and repeated the question. 

“I think not,” said Peerssa. 

“Why? The State’s wonderful 
medicines?’ 

“Yes, if one includes contracep- 
tive techniques as medicines. After 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



25 




the founding of the State, there was 
a generation in which no man or 
woman subject to inherited diseases 
might have children. The population 
fell by half. Famine ended — ” 

“Heart patients included?” His 
father had died of heart trouble! 

“Certainly the children of heart 
patients were not allowed to have 
children. Your genes are those of a 
criminal, but a healthy one.” So 
they’d edited Corbell’s genes from 
the human race. 

“Sarcastic damn computer.” 
Corbell was looking around him 
now. “Nuts. I could have slept on a 
couch. ” 

There were rings of couches 
around freely curved tables that still 
floated. The couches looked like 
humps in the rug. 

Inset within one wall was a row 
of booths. Corbell stood up, 
stretched, and went to examine 
them. The rug-stuff flowed delight- 
fully around his toes. 

In each booth were four rows of 
pushbuttons marked with squiggles, 
below a frosted glass rectangle. He 
pushed a button larger than the 
others (operator?), and got no re- 
sponse. Then he noticed the slot. 

From the tool pouch of his empty 
pressure suit he spilled items stolen 
from a smashed car. A seamless 
silver lipstick meant nothing to him. 
Handkerchief: faint colors seemed 
to swirl in the material. Candy 
wrapper; the hard candy must have 
melted in untold years of rain; or it 
could have been drugs or medicine; 
or he could be wrong on every 
point. Hand-sized lens of clear plas- 
tic, its rim ornamented in green 
squiggles set within the plastic. 

That looked about right. 

26 



He tried it in one of the booths. 
It fit the slot. He pushed the larger 
button and the screen lit. 

Now what? The screens might be 
the phone books he needed. All he 
had to do was punch for 
information — without reaching a 
nonexistent number — and read the 
answer, in squiggles. 

Corbell was sweating. He hadn’t 
thought this out. He lowered his 
hands and stepped out of the booth. 

Well. No hurry. His two-days- 
plus of air reserve were not being 
used. There was time to explore. 

And there, far at the back of the 
lobby, were the stairs he’d ex- 
pected. Broad, well designed by the 
principles he’d learned in his first 
life, carpeted in the cloud-rug: a 
flight of stairs going down into 
darkness. 

He went back to tuck his helmet 
in the crook of his elbow. He re- 
trieved the lens-shaped key/credit 
card. He started down the stairs, 
playing the helmet lamp ahead of 
him, humming. 

With her head . looked 
. underneath her arm, she 
wa-a-alks the Bloody Tower . 

The stairs lurched into motion, 
throwing him backward. He sat up 
cursing. He hadn’t hurt himself, 
but . get crippled here and it 
would be his death. 

Light grew below him. 

At first he thought it was the last 
gasp of an emergency power sys- 
tem. It brightened. When he 
reached bottom it was as strong as 
daylight. There was vast open 
space, a high ceiling, places he 
thought were shops: the feel of a 
European train station, but with 
touches of sybaritic luxury more 



GALAXY 




appropriate to a palace. There were 
fountains, and more of the ankle- 
enveloping rug swelling to rings of 
couches. Along one entire wall — 
“Peerssa! I’ve found a map!” 
“Please describe it.” 

“It’s two polar projections. 
Damn, I wish I could show you. I 
think the continents are smaller, 
which would mean there wasn’t as 
much ocean water evaporated when 
they were made. There are lines 
across it, all from — ” he 
checked — “From this point, I think. 
Most of the lines are dark. Peerssa, 
the only lines still lit run to Antarc- 
tica and the tip of Argentina and, 
uh, Alaska.” Alaska had been 
twisted north. So had the tip of 
Siberia. “The lines run through 
oceans, or under them. Hey, you 
were right about California. There 
are two islands just under Alaska.” 
He saw that what he’d taken for 
shops were alcoves with couches 
and food-dispensing walls. He tried 
one. When he inserted the plastic 
disc, a woman’s voice spoke in 
tones of regret. He tried other slots 
and got the same reedy voice saying 
the same incomprehensible words. 

Next step? Down there at the far 
end, that line of doors . 

Thick doors, with slots for credit 
discs. 

He went back for his pressure 
suit. The stairs carried him up. How 
the heck did they handle streams of 
commuters going both ways? He 
rode back down with the heavy suit 
draped over his shoulder. 

The amp: there were lighted 
squiggles next to the lighted lines. 
He memorized the pattern that 
marked the route he wanted: not to 
the center of the thawed Antarctic 



continent, but to the nearer shore. 
Shores get colonized first. 

The doors: there, those were the 
squiggles he wanted. Were they? 
He checked. Yes. 

He produced his disc, hesitated, 
looked at it. Which side was up? 
He tried it; it wouldn’t go. He 
turned it over and inserted it. 

The door opened. He retrieved 
the disc, glanced at it and smiled. 
The squiggles had changed. He’d 
been docked the price of a ticket. 

He faced a wall with a circular 
hole in it, the hole filled with glass: 
a glass door in a glass circle, and 
beyond it a cylinder lined with 
seats. The front of the car was glass 
too, with shiny metal beyond. 

There was a disc-sized slot in the 
door. He used it. The door opened. 
He pulled the disc out of the other 
side. The door closed. 

“Here I am,” he said. 

“Where?” 

“In one of the subway cars. I 
don’t know what to do next. Wait?” 
“You will not use the instant 
transportation booths?” 

“No, that was a dead end. Those 
must have been toys for the rich, 
too expensive for most people, too 
short-range to be practical. Some- 
thing like that. Why else would 
there be streets with cars on them?” 
“I wondered,” said Peerssa. 
“Four digits in base eight gives 
only four thousand and ninety-six 
booth numbers. Too few.” 

“Yeah.” There was room for 
about eight people, he decided, on 
benches of cloud-rug tinted in pas- 
tels to mark off four seats on each 
bench. There was a food 
dispenser — which spoke to him re- 
gretfully when he tried it. Behind a 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



27 




half-door that would barely hide 
one’s torso, he found a toilet equipped 
with one of the glitteringly clean 
metal sponges. He tried that too. 

His best guess was that the 
sponge had an instant-transportation 
unit in it. It cleaned itself miracu- 
lously. 

There were arms for the couch. 
They would pull out of a slot along 
the back, and lock. 

Through the front wall he could 
see a massive-looking door. 

“There is increased power usage 
from your locus,” said Peerssa. 

“Then something's happening.” 
He stretched out on the couch. No 
telling about departure time. He’d 
wait twenty-four hours before he 
gave up. His stomach growled. 

THE NORN 
I 

Somebody spoke to him. 

Corbell jerked violently and woke 
with a scream on his lips. Who but 
Peerssa could speak to him here? 

But he was not aboard Don Juan, 

The voice stopped. 

Peerssa spoke from his helmet. 
“I do not recognize the language.” 

“Did you expect to? Play it again 
for me.” He listened to Peerssa’ s 
recording of a boyish voice speak- 
ing in reassuring liquid tones. Af- 
terward he sighed. “If that guy was 
waiting to meet me himself, what 
could I tell him? What could he tell 
me? I’ll probably be dead before I 
could leam his language.” 

“Your story has wrung my heart. 
Most of your contemporaries only 
had one life to live.” 

“. Yeah.” 

“Your self-centered viewpoint 



has always bothered me, Corbell. If 
you could see yourself as — ” 

“No, wait a minute. You’re 
right. You’re dead right. I’ve had 
more than most men are given. 
More than most men can steal, for 
that matter. I’m going to stop bitch- 
ing.” 

“You amaze me. Will you now 
dedicate your services to the 
State?” 

“What State? The State’s dead. 
My self-centeredness is as human as 
your fanaticism.” 

The stranger’s voice spoke again, 
in beautiful incomprehensible 
words — and Corbell saw him. His 
face was outside the glass, beyond 
the forward door, as if the heavy 
metal were transparent. A holo- 
gram? Corbell leaned forward. 

It was the bust of a boy, fading 
below the shoulders. He was twelve 
or so, Corbell guessed, but he had 
the poise of an adult. His skin was 
golden, his features were a blend of 
races: black, yellow, white, and 
something else, a mutation perhaps, 
that left him half bald: a fringe of 
tightly curled black hair around the 
base of the skull and over the ears, 
and an isolated tuft above the 
forehead. 

The face smiled reassuringly and 
vanished. The metal door went up. 
The car shot forward and down. 

Corbell was on a rollercoaster. 
He pulled out one of the retracted 
chair arms and hung on. He fell at a 
slant for what felt like half a min- 
ute. Then there was high gravity as 
car and tunnel curved back to hori- 
zontal. 

Light inside, darkness outside. 
Corbell was beginning to relax 
when the car rolled, surged to the 



28 



GALAXY 




left, rolled, surged to the right; 
steadied. What was that? Changing 
tunnels? 

There were no more surges. 

The hissing sound of their motion 
was sleep-inducing. He was tempted 
to lie down. 

His ears popped. 

Better to lie down with his feet 
forward. There would be decelera- 
tion at the end. 

His ears felt pressure again. He 
worked his jaw to pop his ears. 

Peerssa said, “Your speed is in 
excess of eleven hundred kilometers 
per hour. You are now beneath the 
Pacific Ocean. A remarkable 
achievement.” 

“How do they do it?” 

“At a guess, you are riding a 
gravity-assisted linear accelerator 
through an evacuated tunnel.” 

Corbell worked his jaw to relieve 
pressure in his ears. Evacuated? He 
poked his head into his helmet. 

Air pressure was down and still 
dropping. 

He panted as he worked his way 
into the pressure suit. “Vacuum 
tunnel, right,” he gasped. “The car 
leaks.” He wondered what else had 
deteriorated in this ancient system 
of tunnels. He could be stopped be- 
neath the Pacific, to suffocate 
slowly, while an almost human 
ghost reassured him that service 
would be resumed as soon as possi- 
ble. 

Too much imagination and I'll 
scare myself to death . Too little and 
I’ll get myself killed. 

Now the ride was superlatively 
smooth. Presently Corbell emptied 
his bladder; then emptied his suit’s 
bladder into the toilet. The urine ran 
through the bowl without leaving a 



trace. A frictionless surface. 

Hours passed. He dozed sitting 
up, woke, lay down on his face, 
didn't like that, lay down on his 
back with the backpack a bulge 
under his shoulders and a chair arm 
under his head. Better. He slept. 

A surge woke him. He sat up. 
He sucked syrup . sucked the 
last of it, and it was almost enough. 
There was acceleration; was he 
going uphill? Half a minute of low 
gravity, a final surge backward. A 
steel door closed behind the car and 
he knew he was at rest. 

The glass door in front of the car, 
and the metal door beyond it, both 
popped open at the same time. Cor- 
bell was just standing up when the 
thunderclap slapped him backward. 

Sometimes you would end a long 
backpacking trip with aches in 
every muscle and a mind blank ex- 
cept for the determination to keep 
walking no matter what. In much 
the same frame of mind, Corbell 
got to his feet and limped toward 
the doors. His ears rang. His head 
hurt where he’d bumped it on his 
helmet. He’d twisted his back. He 
felt stupid: the thunderclap of air 
slamming into vacuum should not 
have surprised him. 

All he could do was keep wading 
through the surprises until they 
stopped him. 

There were dim lights far back in 
a great open space. He picked out 
couches and alcoves and the faintly 
glowing lines of a wall map. Num- 
bers at his chin showed normal 
pressure or a bit higher, temperature 
warm but bearable. Corbell opened 
his faceplate. 

The air was warm and musty. He 
smelled dry rot. He lifted his hel-

met, sniffed again. A trace of ani- 
mal smell — 

“Meep?” 

He jumped, then relaxed. Where 
had he heard such a sound? It was 
friendly and familiar. Motion caught 
at his eye, left — 

“Mee!” The beast came questing 
through dusty cloud-rug. 

It was a snake, a fat furry snake. 
It came toward him in an S-shaped 
flow. Its fur was patterned in black 
and grey and white. It stopped and 
lifted its beautiful cat's face and 
asked again, like a cat: “Meep?” 

“I’ll be damned,” said Corbell. 

Something rustled behind him. 

He forgot the furred snake. He 
was tired, so tired that in a moment 
he knew he would pass out. But 
there were furtive sounds behind 
him, and he turned, fighting to stay 
on his feet. 

Under a hooded robe of white 



cloth with a touch of irridescence in 
it: a bent human form . 

While the cat-snake distracted 
him, she had struck. He saw her in 
shadow: tall and stooped, gaunt, her 
face all wrinkles, her nose hooked, 
her eyes deep-set and malevolent in 
the shadow of the hood. Her swol- 
len hands held a silver cane aimed 
at Corbell’s eyes. 

He saw her for a bare moment 
while the numbness closed over 
him. He guessed he was seeing his 
death. 

II 

He was on his back on a form- 
fitting surface, his legs apart, his 
arms above his head. The air was 
wet and heavy and hot. Sweat ran 
in his crotch and armpits and at the 
corners of his eyes. When he tried 
to move the surface surged and rip- 
pled, and soft bonds tightened 
round his wrists and ankles. 

His pressure suit was gone. He 
wore only his one-piece undersuit, 
on a world uninhabitably hot. He 
felt naked, and trapped. 

Light pressed on his eyelids. He 
opened them. 

He was on a water bed, looking 
at grey sky through the jagged 
edges of a broken roof. He turned 
his head and saw more of a Bed- 
room: curved headboard covered 
with elaborate controls, arc of 
couch with floating coffee-table to 
match. 

These Bedrooms must have been 
mass-produced, like prefab houses 
you didn’t need to assemble. But a 
tornado had hit this one. The roof 
and the picture windows had 
exploded outward.

The old woman was watching 
him from the arc of sofa. 

He thought: Norn. Fate in the 
shape of an old woman. She was 
vivid in his memory, and so was 
t he silver cane in her hand. He 
watched her stand and come toward 
him . and the fur boa round her 
shoulders raised a prick-eared head 
and watched him back. It was 
curled one and a half times around 
her neck. The tip of its tail 
(witched. 

Dammit, that was a car. He re- 
membered a cat like that, Lion, 
(hough he’d forgotten the boyhood 
friend who owned it. Lots of 
luxurious fur, and a long, rich, 
Huffy tail. If Lion’s tail had been 
multiplied by three and attached to 
Lion’s head, this beast would have 
been the result. 

But how could evolution cost a 
cat its legs? 

He didn’t believe it. Easier to be- 
lieve that someone had tampered 
with a cat’s genes, sometime in 
these last three million years. 

The woman stood over him now, 
her cane pointed between his eyes. 
She spoke. 

He shook his head. The bed rip- 
pled. 

Her hand tightened on the cane. 
He saw no trigger, but she must 
have pulled a trigger, because Cor- 
bel! went into agony. It wasn’t 
physical, this agony. It was sorrow 
and helpless rage and guilt. He 
wanted to die. “Stop!” he cried. 
"Stop!” 

Communication had begun. 

★ * * 



Her name was Mirelly-Lyra 
Zeelashisthar. 

She must have had a computer 
somewhere. The box she set on the 
headboard was too small to be more 
than an extension of it. As Corbell 
talked — meaninglessly at first, talk- 
ing merely to stop her from using 
the cane — the box functioned as a 
translator. It spoke to Corbell in 
Corbell’s own voice, to Mirelly- 
Lyra in hers. 

They traded nouns. Mirelly-Lyra 
pointed at things and named them, 
Corbell gave them his own names. 
He had no names for many of the 
things in the room. “Cat-tail,” he 
called the furred snake. “Phone 
booth,” he called the instant- 
else where booth. 

She set up a screen: a television 
that unrolled like a poster. Another 
computer link, he guessed. She 
showed him pictures. Their vo- 
cabulary increased. 

“Give me food,” he said when 
his hunger had grown more than his 
fear. When she understood, finally, 
she set a plate beside him and freed 
one of his hands. Under her watch- 
ful eye and the threat of her cane, 
he ate, and belched, and communi- 
cated, “More.” 

She took the plate behind the 
headboard. A minute or so later she 
brought it back reloaded, with fruit 
and a slice of roasted meat, hot and 
freshly cut, and a steamed yellow 
root that tasted like a cross between 
squash and carrot. On the first 
plateful he had hardly noticed what 
he was eating. Now he found time 
to wonder: where did she cook it? 
and to guess that she used the 
“phone booth” to reach her stove. 

The cat-tail dropped from the old 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



31 




woman’s shoulders onto the bed. 
Corbell froze. It wriggled across the 
bed and sniffed at the meat. 
Mirelly-Lyra thumped it on the 
chest and it desisted. Now it 
crawled up onto Corbell’s chest, 
reared and looked him in the eyes. 

Corbell scractched it behind the 
ears. Its eyes half closed and it pur- 
red loudly. Its belly was hard 
leather, ridged like a snake's, but 
its fur felt as luxurious as it looked. 

He finished the second plate, 
feeding some of the meat to the 
cat- tail. He dozed off wondering if 
she would shake him awake. 

She didn’t. When he woke the 
sky was black and she had turned 
on the lights. His free hand was 
bound again. 

His pressure suit was nowhere in 
sight. Even if she freed him she 
would still have the cane. He didn’t 
know if the “phone booth” 
worked. At the back of his mind he 
wondered if Peerssa, thinking him 
dead, had gone on to another star. 

What did she want with him? 

They worked on verbs, then on 
descriptive terms. Her language was 
of no form he had ever heard of, 
but the screen and mechanical 
memory made it easy for them. 
Soon they were trading information: 

“Take off the ropes. Let me 
walk.” 

“No.” 

“Why?” 

“I am old.” 

“So am I," said Corbell. 

“1 want to be young." 

He couldn’t read expression in 
her voice or in the translator’s ver- 
sion of his own. But the way she’d 
said that jerked his head up to look 
at her. “So do I.” 



She shot him with the cane. 

Guilt, fear, remorse, death-wish. 
He cried and writhed and pulled at 
his bonds for eternal seconds before 
she turned it off. 

Then he lay staring at her in 
shock and hurt. Her face worked, 
demonically. Abruptly she turned 
her back on him. 

His thrashings had frightened the 
cat-tail. It had fled. 

“I want to be young — ” and 
Blunt! And now her back was rigid 
and her fists clenched. Did she hide 
red rage, or tears? Why? Is it my 
fault she’s old ? One thing was 
clear: she was keeping him tied up 
for her protection and his own. If 
she used the cane on him when his 
hands were free, he might kill him- 
self. 

The cat-tail crawled back onto his 
chest, coiled, and reached to rub 
noses with him. “Meee!” It de- 
manded an explanation. 

“I don’t know,” he told the 
beast now rumbling like a motor on 
his chest. “I don’t guess I’ll like 
the answer.” 

But he was wrong. 

* * * 

She freed one of his hands and 
fed him. It- was more of the same: 
two fruits, a steamed root, roasted 
meat. She fed the cat-tail while she 
was at it. 

The fruit was fresh. The meat 
was like overdone roast beef sliced 
moments ago. She had been out of 
sight behind the headboard for no 
more than a minute. Even a mi- 
crowave oven wasn't that fast, or 
hadn’t been in 1970. It stuck in his 
mind . 



32 



GALAXY 




And he had to go to the bath- 
room. 

She was irritatingly, embarras- 
singly slow to understand. He knew 
she had the idea when she began to 
pace, scowling, dithering as to 
whether to leave him in his own 
filth. Eventually she freed him, first 
(from behind the headboard) his 
wrists, then his feet. She stood well 
back, covering him with the cane, 
while he went into the middle 
closet. 

Alone at last, with the door 
blocking her eyes, he let out a 
shuddering sigh. 

He wouldn’t try to escape. Not 
this time. He knew too little. It 
wasn’t worth the risk that she 
wouldn’t let him go to the bathroom 
again. It wasn’t worth the risk of 
the cane. 

The cane: it had reduced him to a 
groveling slave, instantly, twice. He 
had never even considered keeping 
his dignity. In that, the cane lost 
half its power. He could feel no 
shame. Still, he knew that too many 
applications of the cane would leave 
him nothing like a man. 

He was a shell of a man reani- 
mated by electrical currents and in- 
jections of memory RNA. He had 
been changed again and again, but 
whatever he was, he was still a 
man. What the cane might do to 
him was cruder, more damaging. 

He would cooperate. 

But: she was mad. Even if sane 
by the standards of her time — 
unlikely — by Corbell’s she was 
mad, and dangerous. Old and feeble 
as he was, he would have to escape 
before she killed him. 

The “phone booth’’ must be 
working; he’d seen no microwave 



over here in the bedroom. Good. 

Calling Peerssa would have to 
wait. He dared not ask after his 
pressure suit; it might show that he 
was thinking dangerous thoughts. 
And even if Peerssa were still in the 
solar system, how could he help? 

Corbell left the booth and re- 
turned to his spread-eagled position 
on the bed. She moored his hands 
from behind the headboard, then his 
ankles. They resumed their conver- 
sation. 

The translator skipped words. He 
missed some of it before he realised 
what he was hearing. Then he asked 
questions, got her to back up for the 
blank spots. He heard it in bits and 
pieces: 

She was Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashis- 
thar, a citizen of the State. ( The 
State? He wondered about that. But 
she described it in much the way 
Peerssa had, except that her State 
had been the government of all 
known worlds for fifty thousand 
years . Corbell’s years, for the 
Earth had not yet been moved.) 

In her youth she had been super- 
naturally beautiful. (Corbell tact- 
fully did not question this.) Men 
went incomprehensibly mad over 
her. She never understood the force 
that drove men to such irrationality; 
but she used her sex and her beauty 
as she used her mind: for advance- 
ment. She was bom hyperactive and 
ambitious. By the age of twenty she 
was high in the ranks of Intrasystem 
Traffic Control. 

Because she was now in a posi- 
tion of responsibility, the State con- 
ditioned her. Afterward her ambi- 
tion was not for herself alone, but 
for the good of the State. It was 
routine — and, Corbell gathered from 



34 



GALAXY 




later data, it didn’t quite take. 

If she advanced ihe State’s ambi- 
tions by guiding the courses of 
spacecraft within the solar system, 
certainly she advanced herself. And 
she came to the attention of a pow- 
erful man in a collateral branch. 
SubDictator Corybessil Jakunk 
(Corbell heard his name often 
enough to memorize it) was not her 
direct superior, but he could do her 
some good. 

So powerful a man was allowed 
some leeway for his personal de- 
sires, that he might serve the State 
more readily. (The old woman saw 
nothing wrong in this. She was im- 
patient when Corbell did not under- 
stand at once. It may have formed a 
spur to her own ambition.) His per- 
sonal desire was Mirelly-Lyra 
/.eelashisthar. 

“He told me that I must be his 
mistress,” she said. “I wished 
more stature for myself than that. I 
refused. He told me that if I would 
share his life for a four-day period, 
lie would gain for me a position in 
full charge of the Bureau. I was 
only thirty-six years old. It was a 
line chance.” 

She played him as she had played 
other men. It was a mistake. 

Corbell had wondered why he 
was being made captive audience 
lor an unsolicited soap opera. He 
began to find out. Three million 
years later, at what looked to be 
eighty or ninety years old, she was 
still wondering what had gone 
wrong. “The first night I used a 
chemical to help. To make one 
want sex — ” 

“An aphrodesiac?” 

It went into the computer memo- 
ry. “I needed it. The second night 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



he would not let me use chemicals. 
He used none himself. I had a bad 
time, but I did not complain. The 
third night was the same as the sec- 
ond. On the fourth day he begged 
me to change my mind, give up my 
position, become his woman. I held 
him to his promise.” 

For seven months she was Head 
of the Bureau of Intrasystem Traffic 
Control. She was then informed that 
she had volunteered for a special 
mission, a glorious opportunity to 
serve the State. 

It was known that there was a 
hypermass, a black hole, at the 
center of the galaxy. Mirelly-Lyra 
was to investigate it. After some pre- 
liminary use of automated probes, 
she was to determine by exper- 
iment whether (as theory predicted) 
such a black hole could be used for 
time travel. If possible, she was to 
return to her starting date. 

“Why did he do it?” she won- 
dered. “I saw him once before I 
left. He said that he could not bear 
to have me in the same universe if I 
was not his. But this was not what 
he offered at all!” 

“He may have thought,” said 
Corbell, “that four days of ecstasy 
would do it. You’d throw yourself 
into his arms and beg not to be sent 
away . ’ ’ 

For a moment he feared she 
would use the cane. Then she broke 
into dry cackling laughter. He saw 
something likeable reflected there, 
before her face drooped in brooding 
hate. Now she looked like death it- 
self, the Norn. “He sent me to the 
black hole. I saw the end of every- 
thing.” 

“So did I.” 

She didn’t believe him. At her 

35 




urging he described it as best he 
could: the colors, the progressive 
flattening of core suns into an accre- 
tion disc, the swelling of the Ring 
of Fire, the final drastically flat- 
tened plane of neutronium flecked 
with smaller black holes. “I only 
went in as far as the ergosphere,” 
he said, “and that was only to get 
me home fast. Did you really go 
through the singularity?” 

She was long in answering. “No. 
I was afraid. When the time came I 
did not think I owed the State that 
much.” Her conditioning had worn 
off to that extent, at least. She had 
circled the black hole, using its 
mass to bend her course back on it- 
self, and headed for home. She was 
eighty years old, still healthy and 
still beautiful (she said) due to the 
rejuvenation medicines in her ship’s 
dispensary, when she reached 
Firsthope. 

He checked the times with her. 
Did her Bussard ramjet accelerate at 
one gravity all the way? Yes. 
Twenty-one years each way. Her 
ship was far superior to Corbell’s 
Don Juan . and looked it. It was 
a toroid, bigger than Don Juan, and 
with a cleaner design. 

Firsthope was a colony just being 
established around another star 
when Mirelly-Lyra left Sol. She 
hoped that Firsthope would not have 
records of her defection. 

Firsthope fired on her. What she 
at first thought was a message-laser 
carried no modulation at all: it was 
an X-ray laser, designed to kill. 

She tried again. The next system 
resembled Firsthope: it held a world 
of Earth’s mass and Earth’s approx- 
imate temperature range, whose re- 
ducing atmoshpere had been seeded 

36 



when the State was still young. 
Perhaps it had been colonized in the 
seventy thousand years she had 
been gone . and it had been. She 
was fired on, and she fled. 

“I was bitter, Corbell. I thought 
it was because of me, because of 
what I had done. All the worlds 
would have my record. There was 
no hope for me. I went to Sol sys- 
tem to die there.” 

She had already recognized stars 
in Sol’s projected vicinity. At Sol 
she was not fired on. But the sun 
was expanding toward red giant 
status, and Earth was missing. Be- 
wildered, she investigated further. 

She recognized Saturn, and Mer- 
cury (heavily scarred by mining, 
just as she had left it), and Venus 
(showing the signs of an unsuccess- 
ful attempt to terraform that useless 
world). Uranus was in a wildly al- 
tered orbit between Satum and Jupi- 
ter, if that was Uranus. Mars bore a 
tremendous scar, a fresh mare prob- 
ably left by the impact of Deimos. 
“The State was going to move De- 
imos,” she told Corbell. “It was 
too close. Something must have 
happened.” 

She found Earth orbiting just in- 
side the orbit of Mars. 

Corbell asked, “Any idea how 
they did that?” 

“No. Diemos was to be moved 
by fusion bombs successively 
exploded in one crater. Moving an 
inhabited planet could not be done 
that way.” 

“Or who did it?” 

“I never learned. I landed my 
ship and was arrested at once, on 
my record, by children.” 
“Children?" 

“Yes. I was in a bad position,” 
GALAXY 




she told Corbell, smiling wanly. 
“Even at the last, when I landed on 
Earth itself, it may be that I hoped 
iny beauty would sway a judge. But 
how could I sway children?” 

“But what happened ?” 

Earth was ruled by children, 
twenty billion children aged from 
eleven years to enormous. “It was 
young-forever that did it. The State 
had discovered an ideal form of 
young-forever,” the old woman 
said. “Parents can see to it that 
their children stop growing older at 
an age just below, what is your 
word? When girls begin their cycle 
of blood — ” 

“Puberty.” 

“Just before puberty, they are 
stopped. They live nearly forever. 
There is no resulting rise in num- 
bers, because children do not have 
children. The method was far better 
than older methods of staying young 
forever.” 

“Older method? Of immortality? 
fell me about that one!” 

Suddenly she was enraged. “I 
could not find out! I learned only 
that it was for the few, for the Dic- 
tator class alone. When I arrived it 
was no longer used. My lawyer 
knew about it. He would not dis- 
cuss it.” 

“What happened to the solar sys- 
tem?” he asked. 

“I was not told.” 

He laughed, and desisted when 
she raised the cane. So the State 
hadn’t let her play tourist either. 

She let the cane's tip fall. “They 
told me nothing. I was treated as 
one not entitled to ask questions. 
All that I learned I learned from my 
lawyer, who seemed a twelve year 
old boy and would not tell his true 



age. They learned my crime from 
my ship’s log. They sentenced me 
to — ” Untranslated. 

“What was that?” 

‘‘They stopped time for me. 
There was a building where some 
criminals went to be stored against 
need.” The bitter smile again: “I 
was to be flattered. Only unusual 
breakers of the law were thought to 
be of future need to the State. 
People of high intelligence or with 
good genes or interesting tales to 
tell to future historians. The build- 
ing would hold perhaps ten 
thousand, no more. I was lucky 
they let me keep my medicines and 
my translator. At that I could only 
choose as much as I could carry.” 
She leaned close above the water 
bed. “Never mind this. Corbell, I 
want you to know that there was an 
earlier form of immortality. If we 
find it, we can both be young 
again.” 

“I’m ready,” said Corbell. He 
pulled at the soft bindings on his 
wrists. “I’m on your side. I’d love 
to be young again. So why not 
untie me?” It can't be this easy. 

“We may search a long time. I 
have already searched for a long 
time. I must have your youth drugs, 
Corbell. They may not be as good 
as the Dictators’ immortality, but 
they must be better than mine.” 

Oh. 

He had to answer. “They’re 
aboard ship, in orbit. They can’t 
help you anyway. You’re probably 
older than 1 am, not counting the 
time I gained in cold sleep.” He 
felt the discomfort from the sweat 
pooled under him; he felt more 
sweat starting. He felt his helpless- 
ness. He saw her raise the cane. 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



37 




She waited until he had stopped 
thrashing before she said, “I under- 
stand you. You come from a time 
earlier than mine. Your medicines 
are more primitive than mine. I 
cannot use them. So you say.” 

“It’s true! Listen, 1 was bom be- 
fore men landed on the Earth’s 
Moon! When the cancer in my belly 
started eating me alive 1 had myself 
frozen. There was — ” 

“Frozen?” She didn’t believe 
him. 

“Frozen, yes! There was the 
chance that medical science would 
find a way to heal the cancer and 
the damage done by broken cell 
walls and — ” His defense ended in 
a howl. She held the cane on him 
for a long time. 

He heard: “Open your eyes.” 

He didn’t want to. 

“I’ll use the cane,” 

His eyes were clenched like fists, 
his face a snarl of agony. 

“A frozen man is a preserved 
corpse. You won’t lie again, will 
you?” 

He shook his head. His eyes were 
still closed. Now he remembered 
what Peerssa had told him about 
phospholipids in the glea around 
brain nerves. They froze at 70° F, 
and that was the end of the nerves. 
He’d been committing suicide. And 
why not? But he’d never, never 
convince the Norn. 

“Let me speak this right,” said 
Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar. “I 
won’t tell you about the first time I 
was taken from the zero-time jail. 
The second time happened because 
the zero- time generator had used up 
its power. More than a thousand of 
us returned suddenly to life in a 
world that was baked and without 



life. The weather was hot enough to 
kill. It killed most of us. The rain 
came down like floods of bath wa- 
ter, but without rain we would all 
have died. Many of us reached this 
place where days are six years long 
and nights are six years long, but 
life is still possible. I was old. I 
didn’t want to die.” 

Resigned, he opened his eyes. 
“What happened to the others?” 
“The boys captured them. I don’t 
know what happened after. I es- 
caped.” 

“Boys?” 

“Don’t be distracted. For many 
years I used my time only to stay 
alive. Over more years I learned 
how to build a small zero-time, a 
jail just for myself. Then I altered 
the subway system to take any pas- 
senger from the hot places directly 
to me. I made warning systems to 
free me from zero-time when the 
subway system was in use. 

“Do you understand why I did 
all of this? My only hope was the 
advanced medicines that must be 
carried by any long range explorer. 
One day an explorer would come 
back from another galaxy or from 
one of our satellite galaxies. He 
would know no better than to land 
in places of Earth that are too hot. 
He would need to come to the polar 
places immediately.” She stood 
above him like a great bird of prey. 
“The subway system would send 
him to me, carrying the medicines 
developed in my future, that will let 
me grow young when my own 
medicines have only let me stay 
old. Corbell, you are that man.” 
“Look at me!” 

She shrugged. “You may be a 
thousand years old, or ten thousand. 



38 



GALAXY 




What you must know is this. If you 
are what you say, you are useless to 
me. I will kill you.” 

“Why?” But he believed her. 

She said, “We are the last of the 
State. We are the last of people. 
Those who remain are not people 
anymore. If we could grow young, 
we could breed and raise more 
people. But if you do not have the 
medicines, of what use are you?” 
He heard her try to soften her 
voice. His own voice said to him, 
“Consider. You are too old for 
even your advanced medicines to 
affect you. I am different. Give me 
hack my health and I will search 
out the real immortality that the 
Dictator class used. You are old and 
Trail. You will rest while I search.” 

“All right,” he said. The old 
woman was a Nom, right enough. 
She was both life and death to him 
now. “My medicines are in orbit. 
I’ll take you to my landing craft. 
I’ll have to contact my ship’s com- 
puter.” 

She nodded. She raised the cane, 
and he flinched. “If you break your 
word, you will take your own life, 
when I let you.” 

Ill 

When she was safely on the other 
side of the headboard, Corbell let 
himself relax. An almost silent sigh 
of released tension . followed by 
a wolfish grin and an urge to 
whoop, savagely repressed. At last 
Corbell had set himself a goal. 

He had come down to die on 
liarth. But this was better. 

His hands came free. He sat up, 
but she gestured him back with the 
cane. She made him put his wrists 



together and bound them before she 
freed his ankles. 

The cloth stuck to his wrists like 
bandages. He didn’t think he could 
pull loose. 

The bedroom’s picture windows 
had stretched before they broke. 
The edges were like lines of dag- 
gers curved outward. He followed 
Mirelly-Lyra, stepping carefully 
through the daggers, into knee-high 
grass. 

She gestured him ahead of her, 
toward a bubble-car like those he 
had found in One City. Where his 
feet fell big insects fled, whirring. 
It was even hotter outside, but at 
least there was a breath of breeze. 
The sun sat on the horizon, huge 
and red, casting long blurred 
shadows. A hard-to-see red circle 
on the red sky, smaller than the 
sun, must be Jupiter. 

The car seemed to rest on the 
very tips of the grass blades. It did 
not shift as Corbell climbed in. 
Mirelly-Lyra gestured to him to 
slide over (with the cane, the cane 
that was anaesthetic and instrument 
of torture and what else? He was 
afraid to leant) and climbed in be- 
side him. 

She bent to the console, hesi- 
tated, then punched numbers. “We 
go for your pressure suit,” said the 
translator at her belt. 

The car moved smoothly away. 
Mirelly-Lyra half relaxed; she was 
not steering. Already Corbell knew 
that he could not return by car. He 
didn’t know the destination number 
of the house. 

Down the hill and into a narrow 
valley the car drove, accelerating. 
Now they were moving at hellish 
speed. Corbell gripped a padded bar 



THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



39 




on the dashboard and wished he 
dared close his eyes. 

She was studying him. “You did 
not use such cars?” 

“No.” Inspiration made him say, 
“We didn’t have such things on 
Dogpatch.” 

She nodded. The knot in Cor- 
bell’s belly eased open. God help 
him if she really believed that he 
had left Sol system ahead of her. 
He had to convince her that he 
came from her own future. 

But there must have been inven- 
tions he would know nothing about, 
things humanity would not have 
forgotten. Like what? A bathtub de- 
signed to fit human beings? A cold 
cure? A permanently sharp razor 
blade, or a treatment to stop the 
beard growing at all? A hangover 
cure that works? 

If only I’d read more science fic- 
tion! Well, coining from another 
planet gives me some leeway — “I 
really thought I was the first man to 
reach the galactic core,” he said. 
“Your trip wasn’t even in the re- 
cords.” 

“How old are you?” 

“About six hundred,” he said 
offhandedly. “Our years. In Earth 
years that’s about — ” Don’t get 
tricky. Count on her not knowing 
much about the Earth she came 
back to. “ — Five hundred and 
thirty. How about you?” 

“Nearly two hundred. My years, 
not Jupiter years.” 

“I'm surprised you never ran out 
of medicines.” 

“The children let me take my 
supply with me into zero time. I 
keep them there so that they will 
not spoil.” 

A thrill ran up Corbeil’s neck. 



She’d keep the food there too, 
cooking it in large batches and then 
stopping time for it. That way her 
meals would always be freshly 
cooked. 

And that private jail of hers must 
be very close to one of the “phone 
booth” termini. 

“What was your sun?” she 
asked. 

The only sun he could even spell 
was Sirius. “I never heard it called 
anything but ‘the sun,’ ” he said. 
“Just how much did you learn 
about the real immortality, the one 
the Dictators used?” 

“Only that. When a Dictator died 
it was through violence.” She 
scowled. “Such events were re- 
membered. My lawyer told me 
stories of one Dictator warring on 
another, of war spreading to their 
families. Old stories from far before 
this time. From the sound of it, the 
Dictators no longer served the State, 
even then. Only themselves.” 

“Like Greek gods,” he said. He 
heard the gap: Mirelly-Lyra’s box 
had not translated his remark. 
“Powerful and quarrelsome,” he 
amplified. “Mortals did well to 
bow when the gods passed and 
otherwise try not to get caught in 
the wheels.” 

He glimpsed details of scenery as 
they flashed past. Green-and-brown 
hills. Groves of dwarf trees. He 
looked for birds, but saw none. 
They went over a sharp crest, and 
Corbell’s stomach dropped away. 

The car sped down toward what 
even Peerssa would have called a 
city. 

It showed black outlined in red, 
with the red sun almost behind it. 
There had been a geodesic dome. A 



40 



GALAXY 




piece of the frame, a dozen linked 
hexagons, lacy-thin, still stood 
along one city border. But the city 
itself retained the dome shaDe. In 

i 

the center of a polar coordiante grid 
of streets sat an enormous cube with 
bulging sides: the transportation 
nexus. Spires and glass slabs sloped 
away from it; the tips of the tallest 
buildings defined the shape of the 
lost dome. 

A tall glass slab near the center 
had fallen against the great cube, 
where, bent in the middle, it leaned 
for support like a drunk against a 
large friend. Otherwise this city, 
Four City, was almost undamaged. 
One City had been largely ruins. 
Perhaps Four City was younger than 
One City; perhaps its dome had pro- 
tected it from the elements longer. 

Beyond the city’s edge, the blue 
of ocean carried a sunglade red as 
blood. And this was the strangest 
thing about Four City: that it had 
not spread out along the shoreline. 
The pinkish-white curved line of 
beach was bare of buildings. No 
roads joined it to the city. Corbell, 
peering, made out regularly spaced 
black dots that might have been 
“phone booths”. 

He asked, “Do you know this 
city well?” Play tour director. 
Where’s your private jail, Mirelly- 
Lyra ? 

She said, “Yes.” 

He dropped it. “From here we go 
to the west coast of — ” 

“I know. My machines watched 
your landing.” 

He had almost grown used to the 
car’s reckless speed, but when they 
swooped into the city his composure 
self-destructed. The streets had 
teeth: big chunks of fallen masonry, 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



jagged sheets of glass. The car 
swerved around them, tilted forty- 
five degrees and more to take cor- 
ners, straightened and tilted again, 
while Corbell strangled the padded 
bar. 

The Norn studied him with 
shrewd old eyes. “You’re badly 
frightened. I wonder what your 
people used for transport.” 

“Phone booths,” he said at ran- 
dom. “For long distance travel we 
used dirigibles, lighter-than-air 
craft.” 

“You traveled so slowly?” 

Sweating, he said, “We weren’t 
in a hurry. We lived a long time.” 
For an instant he considered telling 
her the truth. Get it over with. Her 
deal could work for him. They 
would use her medicines to make 
him young. Young Corbell would 
search out the Dictators’ immortal- 
ity while frail old Mirelly-Lyra 
waited it out in a rocking chair. It 
made good sense. 

But Mirelly-Lyra was crazy. 

The car swerved violently, 
ducked under something huge and 
solid. Corbell looked back. 

Embedded in the street like a Ti- 
tan’s spear was a girder of Z-shaped 
cross section. It was as long as the 
average Four City skyscraper was 
tall. 

The car slowed and eased to a 
stop beneath the great rectangular 
face of an office building. Corbell 
let his death-grip relax. The old 
woman was prodding him with the 
cane, gesturing him out. He got 
out. She followed. 

The design of windows on the 
face of the building was not rectan- 
gular; the panes (largely missing) 
were laid out like a pattern in 

41 




stained glass. And there were cur- 
licues above the great glass doors. 
Corbell, still shaking in the af- 
termath of terror, pulled himself to- 
gether. He needed to remember 
these; they might be an address. 
Two commas crossed, an S re- 
versed, an hourglass on its side and 
pushed inward from the ends, and a 
crooked pi. 

Two sets of doors dropped into 
the floor to let them through, then 
slid back up. 

Mirelly-Lyra took them through a 
lobby padded in cloud-rug, then 
through a corridor lined with doors 
without handles. “The lifting boxes 
don’t work,” she explained. They 
climbed stairs: three flights, with 
pauses to rest. They were both pant- 
ing when Mirelly-Lyra turned down 
a hallway. 

CorbelTs fingers worked steadily 
at a button on his undersuit. 

He’d been wearing it since Don 
Juan took off. He’d washed it sev- 
eral hundred times. He twisted and 
twisted at the button. One thick 
flexible “thread” joined it to the 
fabric. It would have to part all at 
once. 

More doors without handles. 
Mirelly-Lyra stopped beside the 
sixth door. She pressed something 
in her hand against the center of the 
door. As the door swung open she 
put the unseen thing back in a 
pocket and gestured. Corbell passed 
through ahead of her. He dropped 
the button as his fingers brushed the 
jamb. 

It was the first risk he’d taken. 
He had no choice. He had to be 
able to re-enter this place. 

Mirelly-Lyra kept her eyes on 
Corbell as the door closed behind 



her. It closed on the button . and 
she didn’t notice. Corbell was look- 
ing around him, everywhere but at 
the door. 

Desk covered with widgetry; 
cloud-rug; “phone booth”; picture 
window. The Offices were mass 
produced too. There were minor 
differences. The “phone booth’’ 
door was transparent. The picture 
window was intact, and rain had not 
ruined the desk or the rug. 

Corbell’s pressure suit and helmet 
had been dumped on the desk. He 
picked up the helmet in his bound 
hands. He called, “Peerssa! This is 
Corbell for himself calling Peerssa 
for the State.” 

There was no answer. 

“Peerssa, please answer. This is 
Corbell calling Peerssa and Don 
Juan . ’ ’ 

“Nothing. Not a whisper. And 
Mirelly-Lyra was watching. 

“My ship may be around the 
other side of the planet,” he told 
her. But Peerssa set up relays! “Or 
the autopilot may still be holding an 
equatorial orbit.” But he wasn’t ! 
“We can call from my landing 
craft.” 

He had to explain equatorial or- 
bits to her by drawing in the dust 
on the desk. Then she understood. 
She said, “We must use the tunnel 
cars.” 

The “phone booth’’ was too 
small. Mirelly-Lyra clearly did not 
trust Corbell that close to her. She 
held him covered while she drew a 
symbol in the dust: the crooked pi. 
“Push this key four times,” she 
said. “Then wait for me. You can- 
not outrun my cane.” 

He nodded. She watched him 
through the door. He paused to note 



42 



GALAXY 




that four of the eight symbols on 
the keyboard matched the four he’d 
seen over the entrance. 

He pushed the crooked pi four 
times. 

Zap, he was elsewhere. The 
world beyond the door snapped into 
another shape. Vast empty space, 
rings of couches humping from the 
door: here was another interconti- 
nental subway terminal. Corbell 
fumbled in the belt pouch of his 
pressure suit, found a circle shape. 
His hands were trembling violently. 
Clear plastic disc: right. With both 
hands he guided it into the coin 
slot. 

He stabbed at the compressed 
hourglass symbol, 4-4-4-4. 

Nothing at all happened. The 
“phone booth" in the Four City 
Police Station must be out of order. 

Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar step- 
ped into view from another booth, 
looked about her, eyes narrowed 
and jaw thrust forward. She saw 
him, still in the booth with the door 
closed — 

He jabbed frantically at the cros- 
sed commas. Remorse, terror, guilt, 
death-wish flashed in his brain and 
were gone, and so was the light. In 
blackness he rammed his shoulder 
against the door and ran blindly out 
into . 

. corridors with pale green 
walls and glowing white ceilings. 
Wide doors with no knobs, only 
small plates of golden metal that 
might have been electromagnetic 
key plates. He turned right, left, 
right, and stopped, face to a wall, 
sucking air. Fatigue soaked into his 
legs like an acid solvent. 

Would she know how to trace his 
“call”? He couldn’t know. He ran. 



A bigger door at the end of the 
corridor dropped open to reveal 
stairs. One long flight ran diagon- 
ally between a sheer wall and the 
tinted glass-mosaic face of the 
building, with doors at landings 
along the flight. He froze in fear. If 
she was out there, she’d see him! 

Then he remembered. They’d 
passed a building with this pattern 
on its face. From the outside it was 
a mirror. 

He was (he counted) three stories 
up. He still didn’t know what kind 
of place this was; but it must be 
some kind of public service. 

All right. By the time she got 
here, if she ran as he’d been run- 
ning, the old lady would be 
exhausted. She’d want to go down. 
So did he, and she’d guess that. He 
went up. At the fourth story the 
door dropped for him, then closed 
as he passed it. He climbed another 
flight, then looked back and saw 
footprints in the dust. 

He stopped, resting, listening. 

No sound. 

He walked backward down the 
stairs, stepping in his own footprints 
as best he could. When the fourth- 
floor door dropped, he threw his 
helmet through, then his pressure 
suit. Then he jumped for it. 

He’d left a pair of sloppy foot- 
prints, but no other tracks. And 
now he was on cloud-carpet. He 
stooped to brush away two dusty 
footprints, picked up his suit and 
helmet and staggered on. 

He couldn’t seem to get enough 
air.

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE

Mankind had reached 
the turning point, and 
a path had been chosen — 
for all but the crew of the 
Jupiter One. 



* 



1 STAND AT THE WINDOW and look 
out at the familiar hardware. It 
stands there taller than life, as if it 
knew which way it was pointed. 
There are lights all over, trails of 
vapor, and an almost subliminal 
megawatt hum of energy. There 
would be a kind of festivity to all 
this if it weren’t for the crowds 
around the fences, and the beefed- 
up security forces keeping them out. 
Fin de siecle festivity, to be sure, 
but anyway something gay, not 
something stolen, something blue. 

A hand to my shoulder now. In 
my distracted state I wonder how it 
is that this appendage of skin and 
muscle, phalanges and metacarpals, 
finds it possible to inform itself 
with such communication of total 
generosity. I touch that knowing 
hand with my lesser counterpart. 

“Nat,” she says. “Will we get 
off the ground?” 

“We will unless something blows 
between now and oh five hundred.” 
I look at the quartz thing on my 
wrist. ‘‘We ought to get some 
sleep.” 

The device on my wrist tells me 
what time it is, and to the nearest 
fraction of a second, but my real 
watch is in a secret pocket. It will 
go with me, not on a round trip to 
Jupiter, but one-way to a different 
destination. It’s an old stem-wound 
Hamilton, passed down through the 
generations from my favorite ances- 
tor. He rode the Pony Express, and 
after that was a telegrapher on the 
Denver and Rio Grande. I am on 



the crew of Jupiter One by right of 
genetic inheritance, though the 
NASA printout would give me a 
more prosaic citation. 

I say we ought to get some sleep, 
but that is a pro forma declaration if 
I ever heard one, made one, and 
Nancy, dear Nancy, recognizes it as 
such. Besides, that’s the way she 
wants it. But sometimes she wants 
to talk first. Particularly when we’re 
about to do something new in our 
experience, such as leaving the 
earth. 

Forever. 

“Are we going to get away with 
it?” 

It is a soft, warm December 
night, a condition under which we 
ought to be able to get away with 
anything. But the weather, barring 
totally unforeseen developments 
during the next few hours, will not 
be the agency that determines the 
fate of our enterprise. 

“Once we’re up and away. We 
do need to get off the ground first.” 

“You’re more worried than you 
let on. What is it? I am a grown 
woman, Nat.” 

“Quite so. And grown in the 
right places, yes, just so. Here — ” 

But she wants to talk. She wants 
to know what I’m worried about, 
and I tell her. 

“There are a lot of people on the 
other side of the fences, and at the 
roadblocks and barricades beyond, 
all of them trying to get onto this 
side. They get in, we don’t go up. And 
that’s the end of it.” 



JUPITER ONE

“But surely security will hold?” 
“It had better, dear one. It had 
better.” 

I make another move, but that 
too is now becoming almost pro 
forma. 

“I don’t get it. I really don’t. 
Think of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo. 
Nothing like this could have hap- 
pened then. I really do not get it, 
Nat.” 

“Nothing like this could have 
happened then,” I agree. “That 
was long ago, but the beginnings of 
this were there if you wanted to 
look for them. You know that as 
well as I.” 

“What do I know?” 

All the vulnerability in the world 
is revealed to me in that query. 
Nancy knows what she knows, all 
right, but this generous woman is 
fearful, now wanting something 
from me. She wants reassurance, 
and I don’t have much of that. 

“You know the mess we’re in, 
and how we got there,” I say. “But 
I’ll tell you anyway. Again.” 

She is now some kind of adult 
homologue of a child, about to be 
bundled into bed in snuggly rain- 
ment. She wants to hear once again 
a thousand-times-heard story, 
caught by the narrative as if it were 
heard for the first time, wanting to 
know how it will turn out, caught, 
enmeshed in the tale as if the fore- 
knowledge of the outcome adds sus- 
pense instead of taking it away. 
This could be called paradox by a 
cavilling logician, which would re- 



veal that he knew nothing of the 
security that comes from the simply 
familiar, though the familiar whatsis 
of the moment is intrinsically 
frightening. 

So I say, again, how it was that 
when some of us were putting 
people on the moon for the first 
time, the first times, a whole bunch 
of others were, in effect, burning 
the books of wisdom and knowl- 
edge. We — the minority of people 
that thought space flight was obvi- 
ously something that simply had to 
be achieved — we had to go out 
there, the way our ancestors got 
into all of the parts of our small 
planet. 

The moon was out there, I say, 
and we had to go there. And did. 
Beyond the moon were the planets, 
and we had to go there. We hadn’t 
done that yet, but our present enter- 
prise was an alleged first manned 
shot at a planet. No, we wouldn’t 
land on Jupiter, but we’d get up 
there, so the program read, and 
we’d orbit, and then send down 
complicated hardware that would 
bring back to our ship samples of 
the planet. These, the program said, 
we would return to Earth for 
analysis and study. Thus, doing 
what came naturally, we would ad- 
vance the cause of wisdom and 
knowledge. 

We are the good guys, I say, but 
the bad guys are agin us and they 
are mean and powerful. They are 
powerful mostly in numbers, 
granted, but numbers count. Some- 



46 



GALAXY 




times numbers are all that count. 
They believe in astrology, I say. 
They consult horoscopes when they 
might be reading Newton or Eins- 
tein or the New Federalist. Science 
is bad, they said, because it made 
those bombs that have been so trouble- 
some since World War II. Better 
to wear flowers, they said, mildly 
stoned and speaking of relevance, 
identity, and the like. 

My modest discursion continues 
for a few minutes, I seeing myself 
as some kind of tribal shaman 
exhorting my hairy clientele, 
gathered round some primeval 
night-time fire, though my audience 
here is Nancy only. Perhaps I am 
trying to get it right for the last time 
for myself as much as for my 
generous woman. 

I am no shaman certainly, merely 
one of a number of, as we say, ded- 
icated personnel about to try to rip 
off what will undoubtedly be the 
last space shot to be launched from 
this place. Or, by the looks of 
things, from anyplace on Earth. 

*T don’t know why I need you to 
tell me we’re doing the right thing, 
Nat, particularly now at the last 
minute. But I do. And we are, 
aren’t we?” 

Nancy had no doubt of that, I 
knew she didn’t. If I’d expressed 
any reservation myself she would 
have jumped all over me, and with 
force. Thing was, we were about to 
take off into the great unknown, fol- 
lowing an unblazed path, a trail 
across the void, a trail whose target 



had been determined only after bit- 
ter dispute, and even then not 
unanimously. We all needed every- 
thing we could get from each other. 
No choice, from the beginning to 
where we were now, had been easy. 
Not even the choice of where we 
would go. 

★ ★ ★ 

‘‘There is no way,” I’d said, 
‘‘that I am going to spend the rest 
of my life in a tin can.” 

“You might not have to. Not if 
we find a happy home in orbit 
around a nearby star.” We hadn’t 
completed our covert study of 
nearby possibles or probables yet, 
but we’d been thinking of Barnard’s 
Star, Zeta Reticuli, and others. 
“You might not have to,” Rod 
Stoneburner said again. 

Rod was, in the ordinary way, 
persuasive. He was, among things, 
a computer programmer, but here 
he was giving me the wrong input. 
He was prematurely thin on top, a 
condition about which he was un- 
necessarily self-conscious, one for 
which he over-compensated with a 
black mustache of heroic 
luxuriance. This ornament now qui- 
vered with his sense of urgency, of 
rightness. But I knew he was 
wrong. 

I was steamed up too, trying to 
keep my temper. This was one of 
our very early meetings. Seven 
people were present, all scheduled 
to be on the flight crew of Jupiter 



JUPITER ONE 



47 




One. At this point we agreed on 
one issue only: we would divert Ju- 
piter One from the stated mission to 
one more in keeping with our 
needs, hopes and aspirations. And 
desperation. We would do this, we 
said, in the interests of the mean- 
ingful survival of humanity, at least 
in so far as represented by the 
minuscule part of it that we were. 

We proposed to undertake this ce- 
lestial heist if we could work out 
the logistics and the tactics, if we 
could learn to conspire successfully 
(none of us had heretofore had 
much experience of that), and if we 
could find one or two highly (very 
highly) placed individuals in the 
Program that we could persuade or 
coerce or coax into becoming 
fello w-consp irators . 

Rod was, by avocation, an en- 
vironmentalist, and his thoughts and 
feelings about what was happening 
on Earth were such that he wanted 
us to get right on out, out to have a 
look at the closest promising 
stars — and beyond, to some more 
distant, if need be, and if we could 
achieve the capability. In our group 
of seven, brought early on together 
in this meeting, he was supported 
by Clara Diamond. She was an as- 
trophysicist, and I didn’t know if 
she was on Rod’s side because she 
was on his side, really, or because 
they were a couple. 

She was Slavic, with dusky, 
dusky skin. A lovely face. On her 
upper lip was just the trace of a 
downy but very black mustache, as 



if she would be with Rod in this en- 
terprise also. That mustache was al- 
ready giving me some concern. Not 
that it was unattractive, it wasn’t. 
That whisper of androgenic influ- 
ence gave a little piquancy. But 
even with the frozen contributions 
of our earthbound fellow con- 
spirators we had a genetic pool to 
think about. Of necessity we would 
be an inbred community. Nothing 
wrong with that, as long as we were 
careful, very careful indeed, about 
undesirable recessive genes. 

The others at that meeting sup- 
ported me. I was as sick as anyone 
about what was happening to the 
earth, and not only to the earth but 
to so many of the people on it. But 
my history and my genes told me 
Rod’s far-out proposal to head for 
the stars wasn’t the way to win our 
new frontier. Or, more likely, even 
to get to it. 

“I might not have to, that’s right. 
But that’s a chance I don’t propose 
to take. Nor would I wish it on our 
children.” 

Rod was as fired up as I, and 
now abandoned reason. 

“So you’d rather stay here. You 
like it the way it is. To stay. Ask to 
be taken off the mission. Develop 
terminal claustrophobia, or some- 
thing.” 

“That’s not fair,” Nancy inter- 
posed. “Nat wants to leave this 
planet as much as you, and you 
know it. He’ll sacrifice as much as 
you, Rod, as much as anybody, put 
up with as much. He wants to be 



48 



GALAXY 




more sensible about it, that’s all.” 

I was grateful for Nancy’s sup- 
port, though I didn’t altogether ap- 
preciate being spoken for. But that 
was Nancy. Rod’s fuse was still 
sparking. 

“The point is this, Rod. We 
know we have a chance, a good 
one, to go somewhere in the solar 
system. Jupiter, the Belt, Saturn. 
The odds on finding a good planet 
in orbit around any of the near stars 
are enormously longer. By orders of 
magnitude, Rod, most likely we'd 
die of old age — and so would our 
children — before we found one. 
And, no, I don’t like it the way it 
is, you shouldn’t have said that, 
you know better.” 

That meeting had ended in exas- 
peration and a degree of acrimony, 
but it hadn’t been a total loss, it had 
been just one of the many steps that 
had gotten us from there to here, or 
from then to now. 

About twenty steps after that one, 
our group by then enlarged to elev- 
en, we’d decided on Titan as our 
target. Ah, Titan! The largest satel- 
lite in the solar system. Not a "real 
planet” by any means, which was 
what Rod wanted, but certainly the 
largest and, we thought, the most 
likely provisional hope for a provi- 
sional part of the human race. The 
sheer time factor involved in going 
to the stars with the technology we 
had, fusion reactor and all, plus Ti- 
tan’s atmosphere, had carried the 
day. That atmosphere wasn’t 
breathable, no, but our alchemists 



thought our descendants could, in 
time, make it so. 

* ★ ★ 

There is a tap on the door and 
Rod walks in. We, the mutinous 
crew of Jupiter One, are gathered 
together in a sterile kind of cross 
between a garish Holiday Inn and 
the contagion ward of a tacky hospi- 
tal. Spread out through this floor of 
the building, here and there in de- 
pressing cubicles, are seventeen of 
us. We come in various sizes and 
shapes, and two sexes. 

“Rod,” I say. Nancy nods. 

Rod is the nominal commander of 
Jupiter One. NASA says so. Once 
we’re off the pad there will be no 
commander. We are determined to 
rule by committee, and the commit- 
tee will have no chairman. We are 
aware that tradition says that the 
way to sweep something, anything, 
under the carpet is to appoint a 
committee to take care of it. But we 
think we can make it work. We’ll 
find out. 

Rod and I are members of the 
committee — the first one: our com- 
munity will rotate through this re- 
sponsibility. There are four others, 
three women and one man. This 
makes a total of six, which is an 
even number. Thus, on matters of 
importance, there may be tie votes. 
There will be no way to break a tie 
other than by the exercise of reason. 
Of wisdom and knowledge. 



JUPITER ONE

“The natives become restless,” 
Rod says. 

We have clandestine communica- 
tion with a few people on the out- 
side, cooperative types whose heads 
are screwed on right. We regret that 
they must remain behind. 

“Will the barricades hold?” 

“I think so. But it’s beginning to 
look dicey.” 

I looked at the quartz thing on 
my wrist. 

“We can advance liftoff by one 
hour and nine minutes. There’s that 
much leeway. Mission Control 
knows what the score is, how the 
situation is developing. They want 
us off as much as we do, Rod. 
Build a fire.” 

Control was indeed what Mission 
Control had, just now, and would 
have until we were on our way. 
After that there would be no Mis- 
sion Control, not as far as we were 
concerned. That spacecraft waiting 
in orbit up there isn’t what it ap- 
pears to be, not on the inside, not 
by a long shot. Thanks to the work 
of our small but intensely motivated 
band of felons there is more fuel up 
there, a lot more, and more of other 
supplies and arrangements than 
Mission Control or almost anyone 
else knows of. 

We have Mylarplex II, with 
which to construct domes. We have 
solar accumulators. We have a mi- 
crofilm library, and a memory-chip 
library, whose complexities I do not 
understand. We’ve spent a great 
deal of time thinking about what 



we’ll need up there. We have seeds 
and plants. The vessel waiting for 
us in orbit is weirdly equipped for 
what it is supposed to be doing; for 
what we hope to do with it, it is as 
well-equipped as we’ve been able to 
make it. 

Our best equipment, our ultra- 
secret weapon is, I think, the crew. 
Nine men and eight women in mas- 
querade. Sarah Cabot, one of our 
astronomers, has become, by rigor- 
ous self-training, a competent ag- 
ronomist. She bears our most patri- 
cian patronymic, but she has the 
face of a Left-Bank gamin. Abe 
Eisenberg, wearing the beard of 
Moses, is a member of the mission 
to perform geomagnetic determina- 
tions. For the real mission he has 
become one of our chemists. They 
will work on the problems involved 
in transforming our atmosphere. Our 
petrogeologist, Sue Powdermaker, 
will be our behavioral psychologist. 
We don’t know how much need 
we’ll have for her expertise, but 
she’ll be there, as trained and in- 
formed as she has been able to be- 
come. 

Many talents and skills, none of 
which is what it seems. 

I? My position in this project is 
peculiar, but my function on the 
real mission is to know something 
about everything. Everybody in this 
crew can do what they’re supposed 
to a great deal better than I can, 
which gives me transient feelings of 
inferiority, but I can do more than a 
little of what each of them can do.

GALAXY 




A human spare tire of sorts, a 
jack-of-all-trades in reserve. I didn’t 
try out for the part, it just worked 
out that way. 

Nine men and eight women. 
We’d wanted an even number and 
an even split but hadn’t been able to 
achieve that. So there was an odd 
man out. Perhaps that would add a 
certain unplanned realism or tension 
to our community. We’d find that 
out also. 

* * * 

“They want us off as much as 
we do, Rod,” I say again. 

Rod looks into the far distance. 
The black mustache moves back 
and forth, seemingly autonomous. 

“They do,” he says. “I’ll see 
what I can do.” 

“Get the sixty-nine minutes. All 
of them.” 

Nancy and I are alone again, and 
there is nothing to do but wait. 
Now I, and Nancy, all of us are 
caught in a chain of inexorable 
events over which we have zero 
control. All of us are except Rod 
Stoneburner: the commander can 
approach Mission Control and apply 
pressure to slip through the window 
the moment it opens. The rest of us 
are frozen into varied positions of 
stasis and frustration. I can’t see the 
others, in their cubicles, but I think 
of them. 

I make another move, and the 
most generous woman in the world 
says, “We’ll wait. We’ll wait, Nat, 



until we’re — in some other place. 

I am, for a moment, frustrated. 
Then my distracted self gets back 
on track and realizes that, rather 
than having been denied, I have 
been given one more gift, one more 
in a long progression of things too 
good for me. 

Some time later Rod comes in. I 
see again why it is that he is the 
commander. Until liftoff. He has 
had his way. 

“Get ready. It will be coming 
over in a moment.” 

“Now hear this,” comes from 
the squawk box, and we are told 
how it will be. 

Our gear, our few possessions, 
are on board the rocket, waiting for 
us. We and the others, emerging 
from our places like pirates from 
caves, go to be suited up. Clara and 
Rod, Sue, Abe, Sarah, Nancy and 
I, the others. Something in this 
strikes me, suddenly, as hilarious, 
and I laugh. The looks of the others 
quickly remind me of the gravity of 
our position. I turn the laugh in- 
ward, but not off. I touch Nancy’s 
shoulder, and hold her for a mo- 
ment. I feel my stem-wound Hamil- 
ton in my secret pocket. My secu- 
rity blankets are in order. 

One hour, twenty-two minutes 
and three seconds later there is 
something of the excitement of the 
old days in the voice of Mission 
Control: 

“We have liftoff.” 

The mob, too late, pours through 
the first breach in the fences. ★

This is an Indian revenge story 
about these two white people who 
meet a dirty old man. Indian author 
Vine De Loria said, “It’s one thing 
to die in battle, but what do you do 
when you’re laid low by an an- 
thro?” The answer is write a story 
about these two white people who 
learn the following lesson . 

^^HEN THEY FINALLY got the old 
man to eat, he ate with his fingers. 
Bullock, the linguist, looked dis- 
gusted. 

“Some holy man he makes! I’ll 
bet the old goat hasn’t taken a bath 
in twenty years!” 

Miss Tarantella, the group an- 
thropologist, looked dangerously 
close to retching. “How can he 
stand to eat like that? He’s abso- 
lutely filthy!” She wrinkled her 
pinched nose with disgust and her 
thick glasses slipped down and fell 
into her lap. She jerked reflexively, 
her lap sensitive to the touch as so 
many things are that are untouched. 

The old man wiped his fingers on 
his chest and grinned at them with 
as many teeth as he had. Two to be 
exact. 

“Good! More eat! More dirty 
eat!” he said, gesturing with his 
hands at the near-empty pot. 

Miss Tarantella put her glasses 
back on her nose and peered over 
the top of them at the old man. 
“No more eat! Talk! You talk first 
and then you eat!” 

“Me no want eat! You eat! You 



dirty you not eat! You clean eat!” 
said the old man with a two-toothed 
smile. 

Bullock looked down at his 
knuckles. He sure could pick them 
couldn’t he. First Tarantella, that 
dried out old prune of a woman. 
Now this dirty old lunatic Indian the 
woman had engaged as a guide. 

“What talk? White fools up the 
flukey wheel! Go down the belly! 
Chomp! Chomp! Not safe! Not 
safe!” said the old man. 

“It’s hopeless,” said Bullock. 
“He’s as unreliable as a weather 
report. All of his gears are loose.” 
“I'm not leaving this mountain 
until I get what I came for!” an- 
nounced Miss Tarantella stoutly. “I 
am not accustomed to failure! If I 
came here to track down the legen- 
dary cave of the Nocka-Nocka, then 
you can bet your camp stool, that I 
intend to do just that! The word quit 
is not in my vocabulary.” 

Miss Tarantella was a positive, 
overweight woman with no sense of 
humor. Bullock’s image of her lay 
somewhere between a German mili- 
tary band whose oompah oompahs 
had gone awry and a self-taught 
virgin who played at human by ear 
and was tone-deaf. 

“Nocka-Nocka! Chomp!” said 
the old man and he pointed a greasy 
finger at Miss Tarantella. “Ho the 
hot one! Big chomp!” 

He clamped his fingers together 
and made chewing motions with his 
hands. 

“The hell with your disgusting 

53 



THE DIRTY OLD MAN 




eating habits, you filthy old beast! 
What about Nocka-Nocka’s cave? 
Where is it?” clamored Miss Taran- 
tella, whose patience was legendary 
for its absence. 

The old man just scratched his 
chest through a hole in his tattered 
shirt and giggled. 

“Maybe he doesn’t really know 
anything about Nocka-Nocka,’’ 
suggested Bullock timidly. “Maybe 
there is no such thing as a. .” 

“Are you suggesting that I am 
WRONG in my research? Is that 
what you’re suggesting?” said Miss 
Tarantella, her icy tone reminding 
Bullock of a wild weekend on a 
polar ice cap. 

Bullock shivered involuntarily 
and quickly retracted his suggestion. 
Bullock was fed up with the whole 
thing. If they never found anything 
it would be fine with him. He didn’t 
care one way or the other. 

Two anything but fun-filled days 
following an insane old Indian up a 
steep mountain on a wild goose 
chase was no picnic. Putting up 
with Miss Tarantella was something 
else again. Often in the last two 
days, Bullock had prayed that an 
avalanche would start and carry 
those two off the mountain. Only 
idiots and Indians climbed moun- 
tains anyway, as far as Bullock was 
concerned. 

“Nocka-Nocka,” nodded the old 
man. He pointed back over his 
shoulder toward the top of the 
mountain. 

The old man scooped up a hand- 



ful of dirt, dumped it in with what was 
left of the beefstew, and began stirring 
it around with his fingers. 

“Christ!” said Bullock who was 
only a linguist and didn’t really give 
a damn. “Is that some kind of cus- 
tom?” 

“I think he’s just being nasty,” 
snarled Miss Tarantella. “These 
filthy old Indians are always trying 
to be purposely disgusting. I guess 
they think it’s funny. He’ll probably 
expose himself next!” 

Bullock just shrugged. He sort of 
admired the way the old boy got 
under Miss Tarantella’s skin. Per- 
sonally, he found the old man kind 
of charming, in a smelly sort of 
way. 

The old man rattled off a long 
curious speech in a Calusa dialect 
that Bullock found hard to follow. 

“What’d he say? What’d he 
say?” demanded Miss Tarantella. 

“I’m not sure I got it all,” Bul- 
lock said. He tried a few phrases on 
the old man, trying to get him to 
repeat the message. The greasy old 
man just sat there cross-legged, in- 
scrutable as a rock. He refused to 
say anything else. 

“Well?” inquired Miss Taran- 
tella. 

“Well, I didn’t get it all,” admit- 
ted Bullock, trying to sort it out in 
his head. “And I’m sure I’m get- 
ting some of it wrong, especially 
the part where I think he said ‘Buy 
War Bonds’.” 

“Never mind what you didn’t 
get, you incompetent idiot! What 



54 



GALAXY 




did he say about Nocka-Nocka?” 
snapped Miss Tarantella. 

Bullock bristled at the words in- 
competent and idiot but let it pass. 
"Well, I think he said Nocka- 
Nocka’s cave is only a bit farther 
up the mountain.” 

“Is that it? The old ass has been 
saying that for the last two days! 
Didn’t he say anything else?” 

“Sure. I think he asked for some- 
thing dirty to eat or at any rate, he 
said something about something 
dirty to eat.” 

“You’re one hell of a linguist!” 
she said. 

Bullock shrugged. Calusa wasn’t 
one of his better languages. 

The old man pointed at Miss 
Tarantella who had taken a 
notebook out and had begun jotting 



down some notes in it. 

“She write down sex? Hot on hot 
on hots! Watch go to bathroom! 
Take picture! All this? She is 
what?” 

Bullock, amazed at the old man’s 
strange grasp of the English lan- 
guage, pointed at Miss Tarantella. 
Not exactly knowing what the old 
man was getting at, he said “An- 
thropologist. She is an an- 
thropologist.” 

The old man grunted and shook 
his head affirmatively. “Dirty eat! 
Pictures of sex! Chomp! Chomp!” 

Miss Tarantella put down her pen 
and glared at the old man. “Forget 
the god damn dirty eat! Can you 
take us to Nocka-Nocka’s cave?” 

“Can take,” said the old man. 
He dipped a handful of mud and 







beefstew out of the pot and slapped 
it on his face and chest and vigor- 
ously rubbed it in. 

“Is he crazy?” asked Bullock, 
turning green. 

“Filthy!” was all Miss Tarantella 
could say. 

★ * * 

They followed the old man up the 
rocky trail, going slowly to ac- 
comodate the huffing, puffing fat 
woman whose idea of exercise was 
taking the lid off a specimen jar. 

“Tell him to slow up! And don’t 
follow him so close!” groaned Miss 
Tarantella. “You know I can’t 
stand his smell.” 

“How much farther is it?” asked 
Bullock, who was getting tired him- 
self. 

“Chomp!” said the old man and 
kept right on walking. 

“Inconsiderate clod!” muttered 
Bullock under his breath. 

“Filthy!” added Miss Tarantella, 
in case somebody had forgotten her 
opinion. 

“I wonder if he’s leading us on a 
wild goose chase?” grunted Bullock 
as he tried to drag Miss Tarantella 
over a huge rock that the old man 
had managed to climb over with no 
difficulty. The old man was disgust- 
ingly healthy. 

“I’ll wring his scrawny neck if 
he is!” puffed Miss Tarantella, who 
was having a hard time getting air. 
Her cheeks bulged in and out like 

56 



sails flapping in the wind. She 
floundered over the rock like a preg- 
nant whale in distress. 

“Somehow, I can’t help feeling 
that he knows more English than he 
lets on,” said Bullock, straining his 
arms almost out of their sockets try- 
ing to get the fat woman back on 
her feet again. “There’s something 
very fishy about him.” 

Miss Tarantella wobbled unstead- 
ily on her feet and grunted. “That’s 
just the way he smells.” 

The old man stood further up the 
trail, motioning for them to hurry. 
“Nocka-Nocka!” he yelled and 
pointed. 

Bullock and Miss Tarantella 
staggered up to him. There in the 
side of the mountain was an enor- 
mous cave-like opening under a wall 
of overhanging rock. 

“Is that it?” asked Miss Taran- 
tella, flushed with exictement. 

“Chomp! Chomp!” said the old 
man. 

“It better be or you’ll regret 
the. ...” started Miss Tarantella. 

Suddenly, a heaving mass as big 
as a semi-truck roared out of the 
cave. It had dozens of green eyes, 
hundreds of red tentacles and bumps 
all over it. It had blue eyes too and 
big mouth-like openings all over 
with big shiny white teeth sticking 
out here and there. It had the shape 
of a ripe squash and the general 
complexion of an overripe tomato. 
It swarmed and it crawled and it 
oozed. On what might be the top of 
it, firmly resting on several white 



GALAXY 




bumps, sat three pith helmets not 
unlike the pith helmets that Bullock 
and Miss Tarantella wore. 

As soon as the creature burst out 
of the cave, Miss Tarantella let off 
a scream that made an air raid siren 
sound like silence. Bullock con- 
tented himself with letting his 
mouth flop open in an imitation of 
the Grand Canyon. 

In a matter of seconds, the crea- 
ture swooped up Bullock, Miss 
Tarantella and the old man too. It 
held them up in the air with its ten- 
tacles. 

“Woof!” said Nocka-Nocka. 

Miss Tarantella kept on scream- 
ing. Bullock, made of less sterner 
stuff, immediately passed out. 

The old man however was per- 
fectly relaxed in the tentacled grip 
of the monster. 

“Woof! A hot one!” said 
Nocka-Nocka and he wrapped a ten- 
tacle around Miss Tarantella’s 
mouth, cutting her off in mid- 
scream . 

Nocka-Nocka pointed all of its 
blue and green eyes at his captives. 
First he looked at Bullock. 

“Yum! Clean!” Nocka-Nocka 
said. 

He looked at Miss Tarantella. 

“Yum! Clean! Big Chomp!” said 
Nocka-Nocka. 

Then he looked at the old man 

“Yeeeeeech! Filthy!” said 
Nocka-Nocka and he dropped the 
old man like he was a live coal. 
The old man landed on his feet with 
practiced ease. 



The monster turned and oozed 
and flowed and crawled back into 
the cave, clutching the squirming 
body of Miss Tarantella and the un- 
conscious one belonging to Bullock. 

The old man crept near the mouth 
of the cave and listened. He heard 
an enormous slurping, gulping 
sound and several big cracking 
noises that sounded like dry sticks 
breaking. 

Solemnly, he went over to a big 
rock near the mouth of the cave. 
Taking a piece of chalk from the 
pocket of his dirty shirt, he put two 
more marks on the rock alongside 
the three already there. 

Then without once looking back, 
he started back down the mountain. 

“Chomp! Chomp!” he said to 
himself as he walked, and his face 
lit up with a smile, remembering. ★

SCIENCE AND MAN S FUTURE: PROGNOSIS MAGNIFICENT ! 






W ell, let’s see: should I begin 
with Freeman Dyson’s highways 
into space, John McCarthy’s home 
computer terminals, Herman Kahn’s 
outlook for mankind, Frank Drake’s 
search for extraterrestrial intelli- 
gence, George Gatewood’s destruc- 
tion of more planets than the Klin- 
gon Empire, Barbara Brown on 
bio-feedback, Adam Reed on 
brain-computer interfaces, or some- 
thing simple like the limits of the 
universe? (And if that isn’t a catchy 
enough lead, you shouldn’t be read- 
ing this; you’re dead from the neck 
up.) 

This is, of course, my annual re- 
port on the state of the sciences, 
occasioned by the 1976 annual 
meeting of the American Associa- 



tion for the Advancement of Sci- 
ence. The AAAS meeting this year 
was seven days long; in previous 
years it’s been only five. Even with 
seven days it was a 20 ring circus, 
and inevitably there were generally 
at least four sessions one needed to 
attend simultaneously. Next year it 
will be worse. I doubt that the 
seven day meeting will happen 
again. Like some critic’s review of 
the painting “White on White” we 
may say of the seven day meeting, 
"Perhaps it needed to be done, but 
having been done it need not be 
done again.” Seven days of concen- 
trated scientific excitement is just 
too much — certainly it was for the 
press corps, and I think for the 
meeting attendees as well.

GALAXY 




Each of the topics mentioned in 
my first paragraph deserves a col- 
umn of its own, and over the next 
year we’ll have several of them. 
This month I’ll try to round them 
all up — which isn’t easy to do. 

Let’s start with the good news. 
MAN’S FUTURE MAGNIFICENT, 
says Hudson Institute. Of course 
one expects Herman Kahn to say 
that. (Actually, Herman was down 
with some exotic brand of ’flu and 
his speech was delivered by his as- 
sociate William Brown, but that’s a 
detail.) The Hudson Institute is 
known for its long-range 
optimism — pollyana in person, 
some say of Kahn. Pollyana or not, 
it’s hard to argue with the numbers 
they’ve generated at HI. For exam- 
ple, they’ve analyzed the assump- 
tions in The Limits to Growth 
model, and found them wanting. Of 
course, so have we, right here in 
this column, but we used the entire 
solar system as our base of opera- 
tions. Kahn’s people stayed with 
Earth, did not assume asteroid min- 
ing or O’Neill colonies, and still 
came up with a good prognosis. 

For example: the LIMITS model 
ignores a very large number of 
sources for “non-renewable” raw 
materials. For aluminum it uses 
only bauxite, and thus concludes 
we’ll run out in a couple of hundred 
years — yet aluminum is one of the 
four most common elements in the 
Earth’s crust, and is easily con- 
verted into useful form. You don’t 
need bauxite, although of course 



that’s the cheapest source and thus 
the only one extensively exploited 
at the moment. 

Item: the LIMITS model very 
nearly ignores recycling, although 
most “non-renewable” resources 
are recyclable. Iron and steel, for 
example, exist in highly concen- 
trated forms — in city dumps. Again, 
it’s only economics that keep us 
from mining them there. Most raw 
materials are not “consumed” in 
the sense that they’re used up 
forever. A few, like the lead put 
into gasoline, are so dispersed that 
they can’t be recovered for any 
price; but most can be, at costs 
higher than present, but not high 
compared to the GNP. 

Item: with present technology and 
presently used arable land, the 
world food crop can be increased by 
a factor of between 20 and 100. 
We’ve already mentioned here that 
if the average Indian farmer could 
get his food production per acre up 
to what Japanese peasants achieved 
in the 12th Century, India would 
have no famines for a long time to 
come. 

I could go on, but the bottom line 
is that Kahn concludes the world 
can, with easily forseeable technol- 
ogy and known resources, support 
15 billion people at an average 
1974-dollar income of $200,000 per 
capita, for hundreds of years. Dis- 
count all those numbers by quite a 
lot and there’s still room for a lot of 
hope. Homer Sap may be about for 
a long time. The “hard problems”, 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



59 




says the Hudson Institute, are not so 
hard after all. 

That’s the good news. The bad 
news is that we don’t know how to 
get there from here. Even Kahn and 
Brown look a bit gloomy when 
faced with the next quarter-century, 
and their opponents are positively 
shocked. Daniel Bell, Harvard 
sociologist, asked Brown “How can 
you say ‘magnificent’? Just how can 
you be so complacent? I have never 
liked the Forester (LIMITS) model 
because those people know no 
economics, but what you’ve said is 
ridiculous. Forty-eight percent of 
the population of Mexico is under 
15 years old. You saw what the in- 
crease in the youth cohort did to the 
US in the 60’s, now it will happen 
all over the world, and you tell us 
everything’s fine.” 

After which the meeting came 
apart, with grey-bearded scientists 
shouting at each other. When order 
was eventually restored, it appeared 
that each side was talking to a dif- 
ferent point. Brown — and invisibly 
behind him, Herman Kahn — was 
trying to answer the challenges pre- 
sented by the Club of Rome. Bell 
and his friends are worried about 
tomorrow. Neither really heard what 
the other was saying, and the short- 
term worriers, infuriated by what 
they think is complacency, have, I 
think, missed an important point: it 
matters what view you take of the 
year 2100. Decisions that must be 
made today to get us to the year 
2000 will be profoundly influenced 



by your long-term outlook. If you 
accept LIMITS and Zero-Growth, 
your solutions to the coming 
famines and droughts — and those 
we will have — are not going to be 
the same as they would if you ac- 
cept Kahn’s world of 2100. The 
best analogy I think of is a ship 
sailing unknown seas when a storm 
comes up. If you think there’s a 
continent and safe harbor ahead, 
you sail on; if not, you turn back. 
In a real sense, then, mankind is at 
a turning point, perhaps as impor- 
tant a turning point as we’ve faced 
in all human history.

More bad news. Two years ago, 
the fusion research people fairly 
breathed optimism. The general im- 
pression was Real Soon Now. No 
more. This year you could cut the 
gloom with a knife. Fusion is not 
going to save us. Everyone still be- 
lieves it will work — some day — but 
the chances of significant and useful 
fusion power coming on line before 
2000 are so slim that few, if any, 
planners even make allowances for 
the possibility. Let me hasten to add 
some good news before plunging on 
with the bad: we don't need fusion. 
Ocean thermal, space-based, biolog- 
ical, and other sources of tapping 
solar energy can and will be able to 
power Kahn’s affluent world: but 
they won't get us to the year 2000. 

There were two days of debates, 
presentations, pitches, arguments, 
screaming matches, and general dis- 



60 



GALAXY 




cussions of energy. The participants 
were high-level people, including 
Marjorie Hart, Senior Planning Ad- 
visor to Exxon, David Rose of 
MIT, Ernst Habitcht of the En- 
vironmental Defense Fund, and 
Donald Allen, President of Yankee 
Atomic Electric. There were 
economists and engineers, nuclear 
enthusiasts and anti-nuclear ac- 
tivists; and when the two days were 
finished there were some remark- 
able agreements. Remarkable, but 
frightening. 

For one thing, over the next 15 
years there are only two choices: 
coal, and nuclear fission. Actually 
those aren’t mutually exclusive, al- 
though they are collectively exhaus- 
tive. We’re going to use coal, and 
in large quantities. The question is, 
do we cut down on coal as much as 
possible by building nuclear plants, 
or do we forget nuclear power and 
set up lots of drag-lines for strip 
mining? 

But — what happened to the other 
choices? Windmills, tides, geother- 
mal, solar, and all the rest of them? 
They went down under a volley of 
equations and hard numbers. Take 
tidal: if you built a damn around the 
entire USA (and wouldn’t that do 
wonders for the environment?) and 
had a 100% efficient system for 
converting tidal energy to electric- 
ity, you could power the city of 
Boston. That may not be worth the 
cost. 

Geothermal: first, it’s localized. 
It may play an important part in re- 



gional power systems, but we 
haven’t as yet the technology for dis- 
tributing that power across the coun- 
try. Second, it’s more polluting than 
early enthusiasts believed. A look at 
aerial photos taken downwind from 
The Geysers in California, or the 
Mexican geothermal plants above 
the Sea of Cortez, will convince 
you of that. The last word may not 
have been said on geothermal power 
for the long run, but for the short 
you couldn’t even write the En- 
vironmental Impact Statements re- 
quired for a construction permit. 

Windmills — same problems, only 
worse. Unreliable. Few places with 
strong steady winds. Again very 
useful devices for local remote 
areas, but hardly likely to provide 
as much as 1% contribution to the 
national energy budget. 

I could go on, but there’s no 
point: I assure you, the consensus 
was remarkable. It’s coal or fission, 
with no other possibilities in the 
running. Yes: I realize that we’ve 
left out methane and ethanol, the 
one produced from sewage, the 
other from growing plants. I leave 
them because they take a lot of dis- 
cussion, and I’m not myself con- 
vinced that methane and methanol 
can’t make a real contribution to 
fuel saving. Ethanol is a different 
story: there’s not that much suitable 
cropland that won’t be needed for 
increased food production, and the 
transport and collection system for 
gathering ethyl alcohol produced in 
thousands of small-holder farms 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



61 




hasn’t even been planned, much 
less begun. Methanol from sewage 
has another problem: why the hell 
should we take perfectly good 
high-grade organic nitrogen fer- 
tilizer, turn it into fuel, bum it to 
produce electric power (and waste 
heat), and then use that power to fix 
nitrogen to make high-grade inor- 
ganic fertilizer? Besides which, one 
power company that tried it was 
told to stop the research: it was an 
improper use of the rate-payers’ 
money. Power companies should, 
according to the California Public 
Utility Commission, produce power, 
not engage in fuel research. 

I want to get off the energy crisis 
(for this column; it deserves another 
of its own) but before I do I can’t 
neglect conservation, which can 
help. By conservation I don’t mean 
turning off lights (although that 
helps.) What’s needed is restructur- 
ing of the legal system. It makes no 
sense at the moment. For example: 
the minimum cost to a power com- 
pany for equipment to generate a 
kilowatt of electricity is $500. For 
nuclear that’s higher. Yet I can go 
buy a cheap air-conditioner that 
wastes a kilowatt, and save myself 
$100 because I didn’t buy a more 
efficient gadget. Is it reasonable that 
I save $100 and cost the ratepayers 
$500? 

Conservation means building 
codes that require decent insulation 
in both private houses and offices; 
architecture that doesn’t waste 
power; rates that make it expensive 

62 



to use electricity during peak 
periods; research into bottoming cy- 
cles (ways to get more power out of 
the low-grade steam at the end of 
the power cycle — useful in 2 ways, 
for direct generation at present in- 
stallations, and as research into 
ocean-thermal systems we’ll need in 
the long run). Real conservation re- 
quires sensible laws (or even the 
absence of laws; make energy cost 
the consumer and he’ll find ways to 
save it himself). 

So much for the energy crisis. As 
I’ve reported year after year, the 
prognosis doesn’t change, but we’re 
no closer to an answer now than we 
were when I began this column. 
This year is worse, because the 
power companies must now make 
decisions. In the next couple of 
years they have to order new power 
plants — and they must now decide 
what will fuel them. Coal or fis- 
sion? They see no other choices 
worthy of billion-dollar risks. 

* * * 

So what else is new? Plenty. 
Let’s assume we get past the energy 
crunch and look at what else we 
might have before the year 2000. 

Biofeedback. The results are un- 
canny, and they’re just beginning. 
Barbara Brown, the VA Hospital 
physiologist whose book started a 
lot of the current fad, is now con- 
vinced that there’s nothing the east- 
ern yogas can do that you can’t 
teach yourself in weeks to months. 
Think about that for a moment: 



GALAXY 




heart rate, breathing, relaxation, 
muscle tension, glandular 
responses — every one of them sub- 
ject to your own will. Dr. Brown is 
convinced of it. 

The results are pouring in, and 
not just from her VA hospital in 
Sepulveda, either. Ulcers cured, 
neuroses conquered, irrational fears 
and hatreds brought under conscious 
control, and all without mysticism. 
When 1 put it to Dr. Brown that 
there was already far more objective 
evidence for the validity of her 
psycho-physiological theories than 
there ever has been for Freudian 
psycho-analysis, she enthusiastically 
agreed. 

She also warns would-be en- 
thusiasts that there are a lot of 
plausible-sounding charlatans jump- 
ing onto the bio-feedback band- 
wagon. People are getting rich off 
selling the equipment — much of which 
is worthless and very little worth 
what it costs. For more on this sub- 
ject, including equipment reports, 
see this column in coming months. 
For now, the news is good: there’s 
hard, objective evidence to show 
that you can, with patience (but far 
less than yoga demands) learn to 
control many allergies, indigestion, 
shyness, fear of crowds, and stage 
fright. That’s got to be good news. 

After I left the AAAS meeting in 
Boston, I wandered the streets of 
New York between appointments 
with editors. On the streets and av- 
enues around Times Square I found 
an amazing sight. (No, not that\ 



after all, I live only a few miles 
from Hollywood, and thus am 
rather hard to shock.) 

Every store window was filled 
with calculators. Not merely “four- 
function” glorified arithmetic 
machines, but real calculators with 
scientific notation, trig, logs, statis- 
tical functions, and the rest. Pro- 
grammable calculators for under 
$300. Presumably there’s a market 
for those things: which means that 
we may, in a few years, have a 
large population of people who re- 
ally do use numbers in their ev- 
eryday lives. That could have a 
truly profound impact on our soci- 
ety. We might even get rational 
decision-making. 

John R. McCarthy of the Stan- 
ford University Artificial Intelli- 
gence Laboratories certainly hopes 
so. McCarthy is sometimes called 
the “Western Marvin Minsky”. We 
spent a pleasant evening with him. 
(We in this case is not editorial: 
myself, Poul and Karen Anderson, 
Larry and Marily Niven, and Rus- 
sell Seitz.) McCarthy forsees home 
computer systems in the next dec- 
ade. OK, that’s not surprising: 
MITS in Albuquerque will now for 
under a grand sell you a computer 
that can do more than the first Uni- 
vac and Illiac machines ever 
thought of. McCarthy envisions 
something a great deal more sig- 
nificant: information utilities. 

There is no technological reason 
why every Galaxy reader could not, 
right now, have access to all the 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



63 




computing power he or she needs. 
Not wants — what’s needed is more 
than what’s wanted, simply because 
most people don’t realize just what 
these gadgets can do. Start with the 
simple things like financial records, 
with the machine reminding you of 
bills to be paid and asking if you 
want to pay them — then doing it if 
instructed. At the end of the year it 
computes your income tax for you. 
Well, so what? We can live without 
all that, and we might worry a bit 
about privacy if we didn’t have 
physical control over the data 
records and such. Science fiction 
stories have for years assumed 
computer-controlled houses, with 
temperatures, cooking, menus, 
grocery-orders, etc. all taken care of 
by electronics. 

But what of publishing? 
McCarthy sees the end of the 
publishing industry as we know it. 
If you want to publish a book, you 
type it into the computer terminal in 
your home; edit the text to suit 
yourself; and for a small fee put the 
resulting book into the central 
information utility data-banks. 
Anyone who wants to read it orders 
it from his own terminal, either as 
words on a TV screen or hard copy; 
no printer, and no publisher. The 
author gets his royalty directly from 
the purchaser. Every publication 
becomes “professional”. 

With such a plethora of books, 
critics and editors would probably 
grow in importance. “Recom- 
mended by Jim Baen’’, or 



“A Frederick Pohl Selection” 
would take on new significance, 
and one assumes that these editors 
would continue to work with 
authors since they’d hardly 
recommend a book they didn’t like. 
“Big name” writers would have 
little to worry about, with their 
readers setting in standing orders for 
their works; new writers would 
probably have to get a “name 
critic” to review their stuff. 

OK, still not all that new for 
science fiction readers; but did you 
catch the time scale? The equipment 
exists now. The telephone net to 
link nearly everyone in the US with 
the information utilities exists now. 
Computer electronics costs are 
plummeting (I paid $150 for my TI 
SR-50, and I could have bought one 
in NYC last week for $65) and will 
continue to do so. McCarthy’s 
home terminal world could be with 
us in the next ten years, and fully 
developed in twenty. 

By then we may not need the 
home terminals. Dr. Adam Reed of 
Rockefeller University has a new 
scheme: direct computer-to-brain 
linkups. Incidentally, Dr. Reed 
made my day by saying, right there 
in the AAAS press conference, how 
much he’d liked a couple of my 
stories which assume implants that 
let the owner talk directly to com- 
puters. I had not, however, been 
far-out enough in his opinion. 

Ten years. In ten years, Reed 
thinks, we will have cracked the 
code that the brain uses for 



64 



GALAXY 




information processing. Once that’s 
done, information can be fed di- 
rectly into the brain’s central 
processing unit without going 
through peripheral equipment such 
as eyes and ears. You don’t read a 
book: the computer literally squirts 
its contents into your head. 

In later discussions with Reed I 
asked if it would be the same exper- 
ience; that is, when I read War and 
Peace there is more than a transfer 
of information, there is also the 
emotional response I have to the 
various scenes; that would be 
lacking in the direct-information- 
acquisition system. We agreed that 
there would probably remain a few 
nuts who read, just as TV hasn't 
quite eliminated literacy in the 
US — but that the normal method of 
acquiring information, particularly 
dull books that one wants to have 
read but doesn’t want to read, 
would be through computers. 

Now the implications of that are 
staggering. First, those who can 
afford a computer implant will quite 
literally know everything known to 
the human race. If a question has an 
answer, you can get it answered in 
milliseconds (assuming that the 
McCarthy-type information utilities 
have been developed, as one 
supposes they will). Want a multi- 
ple-regression equation linking 
weather, gasoline consumption, 
electricity generation, skip keels 
laid, and the price of wheat futures? 
Merely think the question and wait; it 
shouldn’t be long before you have it.

There are uglier possibilities: 
could computer-link implants be 
used for thought control? That 
possibility horrified my friend Ed 
Edelson of the New York Daily 
News, so much so that it was all he 
could think about, and the result 
was a quarrel between him and 
Larry Niven. Edelson kept asking 
the other computer scientists 
whether they didn’t think this was 
monstrous and ought to be sup- 
pressed. None did, which terrified 
him. 

Larry’s view was that tyrannies 
already have the means for 
efficiency, and why suppress 
something that can make us a lot 
smarter? 

Take your choice on those views. 
I’m still trying to appreciate the 
magnitude of what this means. 
What kind of world will it be when 
an appreciable part of the human 
race literally knows everything? 
And don’t forget that these implants 
are a form of electronic telepathy: 
you can transfer enormous amounts 
of information to the computer and 
thence to someone else, and do it in 
seconds — and the first successful 
experiment may take place in ten 
years. By the year 2000 
“education” as we know it may be 
obsolete, with students absorbing 
information the way computers 
absorb punched cards or tapes. 

On a shorter time-span, Reed is 
convinced that implants that “talk” 
to you — that is, feed information 
through connection to auditory and 



optic nerves — will be available, at 
least to the rich. Understand the 
implications of that: we can make 
the blind see and the deaf hear, by 
connecting computer-controlled 
devices into their nervous system, 
by-passing ruined biological 
sensors. When the full 
information-code system is 

developed the same can be done for 
patients without optic and auditory 
nerves. 

Go further: when the coding 
system is completely known, a 
human personality can be 

“recorded”, and if the cloning 
experiments prove out, be 

transcribed into a younger edition of 
the same person: know what you 
have learned at fifty and put it into 
a body aged 25. 

Far out? Science fiction? No. 
There’s a real possibility that it can 
happen to some of you who read 
this column. 

It’s getting hard for science 
fiction writers to keep up: even 
we’re getting future shock. What 
can we write about that some 
scientist isn’t already doing? 

ETI: Extra-Terrestiral-Intelli- 
gence. Surely that belongs to sf 
writers? 

Yes. Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, 
and the others have been trying, but 
so far they’ve received no messages 
from Out There. Of course they’ve 
only listened for a short time, to a 
few stars, and on a few frequencies. 
They’ve also had a listen at a few 
nearby galaxies. As Sagan puts it, 



66 



GALAXY 




we can conclude that in those 
galaxies no one just now (well, just 
then; it takes quite a while for sig- 
nals to get here from another 
galaxy) wants so badly to talk to us 
that they’ve built a system that can 
do it. 

George Gatewood of the 
University of Pittsburgh has another 
approach: he’s looking for planetary 
systems in close-by stars. There’ ve 
been a number of recent 
publications announcing such 
planets, in places like Tau Ceti, 
Epsilon Eridani, etc. Gatewood has 
new astronometric techniques for 
analyzing already-collected data, as 
well as gathering new information, 
and he used it on 33 nearby stars: 
with horrible results. He destroyed 
more planetary systems than the 
Klingons. 

There aren’t any. At least, there 
aren’t any that have Jupiter-sized 
planets, with the possible exception 
of Barnard’s Star, and that, alas, is 
a wretched red dwarf that almost 
certainly has no inhabitable planets 
even if it does have a Jupiter-like 
companion. 

There’s still hope. Gatewood’s 
techniques can’t find terrestrial- 
sized planets at interstellar 
distances. Freiland at Tau Ceti may 
yet exist; we don’t know enough 
about planetary systems to be able 
to say. After all, Jupiter-size planets 
don’t have to form in order for 
smaller planets to come into being. 
Or do they? As Gatewood says, 
once we have a sample larger than 



one we may be able to make some 
generalizations. 

He’s also got a proposal: give 
him one shuttle payload and about 
$200 million bucks, and he can de- 
tect terrestrial planets up to 15 light 
years away. Gatewood isn’t the 
only one who hopes we’ll get 
telescopes in space. As Phillip 
Morrison of MIT put it, the only 
way we can really study our own 
sun is to learn a lot more about 
other suns — and it’s insane not to 
know our sun as well as possible. 
Unfortunately, although NASA 
asked for funding to develop the 
Large Space Telescope (LST, and 
that’s got to be one of the most un- 
fortunate names for a science proj- 
ect in history; reminds me of 
Okinawa), Congress put the project 
off for another year. LST isn’t 
dead, but this is the third delay in 
program-start, and some of us are 
getting worried. 

I’m coming to the end of my 
space, and I still haven’t talked 
about X-ray objects in space (and 
crashing neutron stars, a theory 
almost certainly wrong but beautiful 
in conception). I’ve said nothing 
about the universe — is it open or 
closed? (Some think yes, some no, 
but the evidence is itself 
fascinating. Best evidence is still for 
“open”, but stand by.) I haven’t 
touched IQ and intelligence, new 
theories about the origins of the 
Earth-Moon system, or Viking. I’ve 
had to ignore molecular biology, 
climate research, upper-atmosphere 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



67 




physics (aerosol cans haven’t killed 
us yet and maybe they won’t after 
all) or the care and feeding of child 
prodigies. 

I can’t, though, ignore Freeman 
Dyson’s Space Highways. 

★ ★ ★ 

Some readers will recall that in 
my own stories I often postulate 
laser launching systems: that is, a 
very large laser that stays on the 
ground provides the energy to put 
spacecraft into orbit. It wasn’t my 
invention: I took the concept 
wholesale from published work 
done at Avco-Everett Research 
Center. It’s not only feasible, it 
seems inevitable, and we’ve 
discussed it before in this column. 

Dyson wants the US to build 
such a system. It is, he says, far better 
than the shuttle, because it will give 
access to space — not merely for gov- 
ernment and big corporations, but for 
a lot of people. 

Dyson envisions a time when you 
can buy, for about the cost of a 
present-day house and car, a space 
capsule. The people collectively 
own the laser-launch system, and 
you pay a small fee to use it. Your 
capsule goes into orbit. As I proved 
in the very first of these columns 
two years ago, once you’re in Earth 
orbit, you’re halfway to anywhere. 
Specifically, you’re halfway to the 
L-5 points, if you want to go help 
build O’Neill colonies. You’re 
halfway to the asteroids, if you’d 
like to try your hand at prospecting. 

68 



You’re halfway to Mars orbit if 
that’s your desire. 

America, Dyson points out, wasn’t 
settled by big government projects. 
The Great Plains and California were 
settled by thousands of free people 
moving across the plains in their own 
wagons. There is absolutely no reason 
why space can’t be settled the same 
way. All that’s required is access. 

Dangerous? Of course. Many 
families will be killed. A lot of 
pioneers didn’t survive the Oregon 
Trail, either. But if we’ve such a hor- 
rendous surplus of people on this 
planet, why is it the same people who 
are so enamoured of Zero-Growth 
also want to protect everyone from 
every conceivable risk? Dyson’s vis- 
ion is different. Perhaps his first name 
has something to do with it? Because 
he’s right, you know. That kind of 
Highway to Space would generate 
more true freedom than nearly any- 
thing else we could do; and if the his- 
torians who think one of the best fea- 
tures of America was caused by our 
open frontiers, and that we’ve lost 
much of our freedom through loss of 
the frontier — if they’re right, we can 
in a stroke bring back a lot of what’s 
right with the country. 

So: combine it all. Dyson’s High- 
ways; Brown’s bio-feedback; McCar- 
thy’s home terminals and Reed’s 
brain-computer links; Kahn’s view of 
the future, and even my own ideas on 
survival with style. It’s all for real, 
you know. Not science fiction at all. 
We’ve only to reach out and grasp it. 

Why the hell don’t we get at it?*

A Little Bit Of 





W>'V\ 




The boy is father to the man, 
the future is born of the pres- 
ent; nothing else would make 
any sense. 



Even before he was really 
awake, Jeff knew his father was hit- 
ting his mother again, knew as he 
rose through layers of sleep that her 
cry of pain was awakening him. 
The way it always did. 

But now that he was fully con- 
scious the night was silent. Through 
the square of window beside his bed 
he could see the trunk of the 
spindly pine tree outlined in the 
moonlight, and the silver sheen on 
the roof of his father’s old 1963 
Ford parked under it. 

Then his father’s voice rasped 
through the thin wall, growling 
brutal words like those that had 
bruised Jeff’s own ears so many 
times. He shivered, tasting the sick- 
ness that always soured his throat at 
such times. He turned his gaze to- 
ward the bedroom door. His mother 
would be coming through it soon, at 
least he hoped she would. That way 
he knew that for the rest of the 
night she would be safe. And who 



knows? Tomorrow or the next day 
his father might go away again — 
and stay away this time, for always. 

Those were the good times; when 
his father was gone. Happy times 
when his mother and he had gone 
for walks along the roadside, find- 
ing nuts or berries or wildflowers; 
or had sat on the sagging front 
porch after he got home from 
school and played fish on the 
cracked top of the old wicker table 
the Andersons had given them. The 
Andersons sometimes brought them 
groceries and hand-me-down clothes 
as well because they knew his 
father was gone and his mother 
wasn’t too well. 

Of course, his mother had food 
stamps so they could get their own 
groceries, but Jeff knew they were 
poor. When his father was gone that 
didn’t seem to matter because they 
were so happy, but when his father 
came back, Jeff knew what poverty 
was all about. It meant his father 
sat on the front porch all day in his 
undershirt, staring down the road 
that ran past their lot, through the 
woods, and down the mountainside 
into town, the bottle of whiskey be- 
side his chair getting emptier. It 
meant that his mother stayed in bed 
most of the time and hardly ever 
laughed or played cards with him. It 
meant that when Jeff got home from 
school he had to get right at the 
chores or get a licking. 

“Kids like you nowadays got it 
made,” his father would tell him. 
“Why, when I was a kid I had to 



A LITTLE BIT OF RECYCLED TIME 



71 




walk four mile to school and four 
mile back, no matter what the 
weather, even when it was bitter 
cold or pouring down cats and 
dogs. You and your school bus! 
You don’t know what hard times is, 
boy.” 

When his father was feeling 
worse than usual, Jeff had to be 
careful to stay out of his way or get 
a licking for no reason at all. 

He was cussing at his mother 
now, and Jeff knew she wouldn’t 
say anything back. She’d just put 
on her old brown chenille robe and 
come into Jeff’s room. 

He watched the door and sure 
enough, the knob turned quietly and 
it opened a crack, letting in a faint 
smell of the salt pork and cabbage 
they’d had for dinner that night. 
Then it closed and she was standing 
beside him. 

She was whispering. ‘‘Jeff? You 
asleep?” 

‘‘No, Mom.” He slid across to- 
wards the window, leaving his pil- 
low so that she could lay her head 
on it. She collapsed weakly on top 
of the covers, hardly even moving 
the little bed with her slight weight, 
her face a pale glimmer next to 
him. 

“I’m sorry he woke you,” she 
said. “You need your sleep for 
school tomorrow, so you’ll be 
fresh.” 

“It wasn’t him. I just can’t stand 
to hear you crying.” 

“Oh Jeff, I’m not crying. I’m 
just fine.” 

72 



“He hit you again, didn’t he.” It 
Wasn’t a question. 

A thin sigh. “It’s hard on a man 
to be out of work, Jeff. That’s why 
you’ve got to get your schooling. 
It’s important. Your Pa and I never 
really had the chance.” 

“But Mark’s father’s out of work 
too, -and he’s real nice.” 

“Jeff, did you remember you’re 
going to have a birthday next 
week?” She was trying to make her 
voice happy. “Your ninth birthday, 
and you’re going to have a party.” 
He was suddenly interested. “A 
party? I’m going to have a party?” 
“Freda Anderson says Julie’s 
birthday’s just the day after yours, 
and why don’t you both celebrate 
together at their house? She says 
we’ll have the party on Julie’s 
birthday, because that’s Saturday, 
but she and me are going to bake 
two cakes, one that says ‘happy 
birthday Jeff’ and one that says 
‘happy birthday Julie’, and there’ll 
be games to play, and prizes ...” 
But Jeff wanted a bike for his 
birthday and he knew he couldn’t 
have it, and the thought of watching 
Julie opening all the presents he 
knew she’d get and him not getting 
the bike he longed for dimmed his 
first excitement. 

“Don’t that sound like fun, 
Jeff?” 

“Yes,” he said. 

“Oh, it will be. It will be fun.” 
She was silent and Jeff listened to 
her breathing, that always sounded 
sort of scratchy, and to the sighing 



GALAXY 




of the October wind through the 
tree branches. 

Then she spoke again. “Did I tell 
you what I saw this morning, 
Jeff?” 

“No, Mom. What?” 

“I was out on the porch this morn- 
ing real early, before sunrise, getting 
a breath of fresh air. That’s a pretty 
time, Jeff. I usually feel real good 
in the morning about then, like I 
could start right in baking and 
weeding and doing the wash and 
ironing without even getting tired. 
Just sail through all of it, like I 
used to.” 

“You’ll be feeling better soon, 
Mom,” Jeff said. But it had been a 
long time since she’d felt good. 
Way before last Christmas, even, 
when she’d been going to have a 
baby and then something happened 
to it. 

“Anyway,” she went on in her 
soft voice, “I was standing by the 
railing, just breathing in the good 
air and watching the sky get lighter, 
and all of a sudden I saw it.” She 
paused and looked at him, her eyes 
shining in the darkness. 

“What?” 

“Well, it was big and shiny 
silver and it had lights on it, and it 
was sort of cigar-shaped . .” 

“Oh Mom, that was just an 
airplane!” 

“No, Jeff. It was different.” 

“Did it have red and green 
lights?” 

“No, they were just sort of 
orangy red, and it whirled and 



wheeled up in the sky right over the 
road, and then it come down lower 
so I got a real good look at it.” 
“What did it look like? Did you 
see anybody on it?” 

“It just looked like a big silver 
flying saucer, like you see pictures 
of. Nobody on it that I know of, 
but then you wouldn’t know there 
was anybody on an airplane, either, 
until it landed and they got off.” 
“What did it do?” Jeff pictured 
the little green men from Mars, 
maybe, or Venus, who would be 
inside the silver ship. “Did it 
land?” 

“No. I don’t think so, anyway. It 
just come down over the house and 
then went up again, real fast, and 
whirled off over the woods so that I 
couldn’t see it no more.” 

“But maybe it landed someplace. 
Maybe it’s close by and we could 
go and see it.” 

His mother laughed softly. “I 
think somebody would have seen it 
by now if it come down. They’d 
have the sheriff and the newspaper 
and TV folks up here so fast you 
wouldn’t know what happened.” 
“Are you going to tell them you 
saw it?” 

She moved slightly and shook her 
head. “Everybody would think I’m 
plumb crazy if I told them. That’s 
why I wouldn’t tell no one but you, 
Jeff. It’ll be our secret.” 

“But gee, Mom, maybe they 
wouldn’t think you were crazy. 
Maybe they’d put you on television 
or something.” 



A LITTLE BIT OF RECYCLED TIME 



73 




“No, I don’t think they’d believe 
me. Guess I’ll just keep still about 
it.” 

“Can’t I tell Mark?” Jeff thought 
of how impressed his friend would 
be. He’d never seen a flying saucer. 

“Well . okay, but just Mark. 
And you tell him not to tell nobody, 
hear? Now you better turn over and 
close your eyes. It’s late, and you’ll 
be tired in the morning.” 

Jeff obediently turned over, face 
toward the window, and closed his 
eyes. Tomorrow he’d try to get up 
real early. Maybe he’d see the fly- 
ing saucer, too. 

★ ★ ★ 

In the control room of the 
T.T.C., Vahran examined the real- 
time chronometer. “I hope we’ve 
been more precise,” he said. 
“What was it last time? A week 
early? A month?” 

Captain Wolford shook his head. 
“Twenty-seven hours, according to 
our passenger. This time we may be 
an hour off, more or less. Not bad 
at all. Powers had a few minor ad- 
justments made in the isochronal 
mechanisms. We’ve never had to be 
this exact before.” 

“This trip seems to be a first for 
a lot of things.” Vahran was trying 
to hide his nervousness, his distaste 
for this whole matter, but he could 
hear the bitterness in his voice. He 
wouldn’t be here if there hadn’t 
been so much money involved. 
Wolford looked at him sharply.

“Compose yourself, Lieutenant. 
The Project Head explained all the 
ramifications to you himself when 
this trip was first planned, and you 
chose to come. Remarks like that in 
the passenger’s hearing might cause 
problems later.” 

“I wouldn’t say it where he 
could hear me,” Vahran said. 

“Well, look in and make sure 
he’s strapped down, will you?” 

Vahran went to the doorslit that 
widened as he touched it, and step- 
ped through into the large central 
cabin. The passenger was sitting in 
the red glow, gazing raptly at the 
panorama of Arkansas countryside 
projected on the screens below and 
around him, his big head with its 
mat of thick, blond hair moving 
restlessly as he tried to catch every 
bit of the view. His broad, pale face 
seemed composed but Vahran knew 
he must be feeling a lot more than 
he was showing. 

McCoy’s calm manner must be 
habitual with him now. It should, 
after years spent assuring his pa- 
tients that the symptoms of aging 
could indeed be reversed, that they 
could expect to live to be approxi- 
mately two hundred years old, stay- 
ing healthy and active the entire 
time. The “McCoy Method” had 
won him a Nobel prize. He was 
wealthy and famous, and Vahran 
knew this was why McCoy could 
do what no one had ever done be- 
fore him . perhaps what no one 
should ever do. 

“Strap yourself in for landing, 
GALAXY 




Dr. McCoy,” he said and went 
back through the doorslit into the 
control room. 

Wolford looked up as Vahran en- 
tered. ‘‘Sit down and get yourself 
buckled in, Lieutenant, and try not 
to look like we’re about to time- 
gress into a freight train.” 

Vahran nodded slowly. “You try- 
ing to tell me I’m the only one 
who’s worried. Captain?” 

“Just do your job, Lieutenant,” 
the captain said coolly. 

“But you don’t like this any bet- 
ter than I do.” 

Wolford shrugged. “McCoy con- 
vinced all the right people. A lot of 
people owe him favors; how can 
you turn down someone who’s 
given you or your loved ones 
another hundred, hundred and 
twenty years of life? They have to 
satisfy McCoy, and we have to 
satisfy them.” 

Vahran stretched his stocky frame 
so that the chair cushioned itself 
into a reclining position against 
him. “By taking the chance that 
everybody else and their loved ones 
won’t be there when we get back?” 

Wolford’s grey eyes hardened 
under his grey brows. “The plan is 
perfect. It won’t fail unless ye or I 
fail.” 

“But why weren’t experiments 
ever made on this? Why weren't the 
paradoxes ever studied?” 

“Probably because studying one 
would mean causing one. This kind 
of thing was never supposed to 
happen. Rules were set up.” 



“But it’s happening now,” Vah- 
ran said doggedly. 

Wolford ignored him. “Prepare 
yourself for landing in . .” he 
looked at a dial in front of him, 
“. thirty-six seconds.” 

And you’re just as nervous about 
all this as I am, Vahran thought, 
following the captain’s gaze to the 
control panel. So many things could 
go wrong. The date register showed 
that it was now October 10, 1976. 

★ ★ ★ 

McCoy had expected some kind 
of shock from the landing, but there 
was none. The only sign that they 
were down came when the viewers 
that surrounded him went dark. The 
infrabeams had been turned off, the 
red light that had filled the room 
dimmed, and he sat blinking in the 
incandescence that replaced it. 

He loosened the straps of the 
chair and stood up, stretching, for- 
cibly restraining the impatience that 
urged him to burst from the capsule 
and race across the field to the old 
frame house that waited for him in 
the October mist. “Time enough,” 
he told himself and smiled faintly at 
the words. 

The doorslit widened and the 
Captain entered with Lt. Vahran 
close behind. The captain spoke 
briskly. “Are you ready?” 

McCoy nodded. 

“Then I’ll just run through the 
caveats once more.” 

The lieutenant was looking 



A LITTLE BIT OF RECYCLED TIME

scared, McCoy noticed, but then the 
lieutenant had looked scared the 
first time, too. He wondered briefly 
why his friend Greg Powers, the 
president of Project Anachron, had 
sent Vahran along on this second at- 
tempt. Either Vahran hadn’t voiced 
his fear or he was the only man 
Powers could send. There weren’t 
many chrononauts, McCoy knew. 
The project was still very young, 
very secret, and very risky, and it 
was limited to use by those with a 
serious purpose: archaeologists, his- 
torians . and McCoy. 

Captain Wolford was talking. 
. not one other person must be 
involved other than your subject. 
Even animals and insects should be 
avoided. Do not remove anything 
from the site, or move or damage 
anything while you are there. The 
utmost care in walking and bodily 
movement must be observed. Al- 
ways walk on paved surfaces in pre- 
ference to lawns, fields, dirt. Al- 
ways remove any evidence of your 
presence that might be left, such as 
footprints, fingerprints, etcetera.” 

McCoy raised an impatient hand. 
“I think I remember everything, 
Captain.” 

Wolford nodded curtly. ‘‘All 
right then. Good luck, and we’ll 
expect you back here within thirty 
minutes. We can’t remain stationary 
longer than that.” 

So little time, McCoy thought as 
he went through the port of the time 
transport and jogged across the open 
field toward the road. But then 



there was always too little time, and 
at least this segment of it was his to 
re-use. Recycled time. How often 
he’d wished for that. Who hadn’t? 
And now a tiny bit of it was his. 

The sky was grey, the air heavy 
with a chill mist. He was on the 
road now, and as soon as he passed 
the woods he would see it, the 
house where he had been born and 
where he had slept last night, prob- 
ably dreaming about the bike he 
wanted for his ninth birthday. But 
he would have left for school by 
now, and his father would be gone, 
if they had timed it exactly right. 
He would have liked to see himself 
as he was then. He would even 
have liked to see his father, but of 
course there was no way. His 
mother had to be alone. 

When the initial miscalculation 
had brought him back here for the 
first time yesterday morning his 
mother must have been on the front 
porch, for she’d seen the T.T.C. A 
dim memory came of how she’d 
told him she’d seen a ‘‘flying 
saucer.” In the years that followed 
he had come to believe she’d made 
up the story just to take his mind 
off the reality of their lives. Now he 
knew she had spoken the truth. 

He was past the woods and the 
mist was lifting. He stopped on the 
road, looking across the expanse of 
dirt and pebbles and straggling 
grass, past the sad old pine tree 
where his father had always left the 
car, up the sagging wooden steps to 
the cavern of darkness under the 



76 



GALAXY 




weather-worn eaves of the porch, 
where his mother stood staring at 
him. 

She wore that old brown chenille 
robe, but she looked younger than 
he remembered. Her face was a 
thin, delicate triangle under long, 
untidy blond hair. Her lips were 
pale, her eyes large and sad as they 
watched him, uncomprehending. 

He had prepared himself for this 
moment a thousand times. She 
looked timid, embarrassed to be 
standing so disheveled before a 
stranger, and he knew he had to 
reassure her quickly or she would 
slip through the door before he 
could stop her. 

He smiled and called out: “Mrs. 
McCoy, I have an important mes- 
sage for you,” as he strode to the 
porch steps, pausing at the bottom 
to look up at her. 

By then she already had one hand 
on the knob of the closed front 
door, the other clasping her robe 
together at her neck. ‘‘A message? 
For me? From who?” 

His heart was pounding so loudly 
he was afraid she might hear it. 
‘‘From Freda Anderson,” he said 
breathlessly, remembering the name 
she would believe. 

Sure enough, she let go of the 
doorknob and leaned over the porch 
rail. 

“Is she sick, or what?” 

“She’s had another attack. She 
wants you to come right away.” 

“Oh, but I can’t go like this. I’ll 
have to change.” 



“No. Please. I ... I have my 
car waiting down the road. We can 
be there in a few minutes without 
anyone seeing you. If you don’t 
come now, it might be too late.” 

Her eyes grew doubtful and she 
grasped the housecoat more tightly. 
“Who are you?” 

He wanted to tell her, and then 
run to her and hug her. He wanted 
that more than anything at this mo- 
ment, but there would be no way to 
convince her. She wouldn’t under- 
stand. “I’m Freda’s brother. 
from Albany.” 

“Why, she never spoke of a 
brother to me!” 

“Please Mrs. McCoy, believe 
me. I’m her brother, here on a visit. 
Freda asked me to come for you. I 
was the only one they could spare.” 
He was forcing himself to stay 
calm, hiding the fury of his own 
desire to get her away from this 
place “It’s urgent, Mrs. McCoy. 
She needs you.” 

She was convinced now, moving 
down the porch steps timidly but 
steadily, and she glanced back only 
once at the closed front door and 
the quiet house as she walked with 
him toward the road. 

Jeff McCoy kept his hands from 
touching her. Now he had to do the 
rest of it. The hardest part, perhaps. 

“How bad off is she?’’ his 
mother was asking. 

“Pretty bad.” 

They were at the road now and 
she was looking anxiously around. 
“Where’s your car?” 



A LITTLE BIT OF RECYCLED TIME 



77 




He kept his voice light. “Just 
down a way.” 

“But where?” Her voice was ris- 
ing with apprehension and suspi- 
cion. 

“Just beyond the woods. I parked 
off the road in the field.” 

She stared up at him. “Why 
'would you park so far away?” 

She was stopping now, and his 
hands went out and grasped hers, 
pulling her toward him. 

“Look at me,” he said urgently. 
“Don’t you know me?” 

She tried to pull away. “What do 
you want? Let me go!” 

This was all wrong. Clumsy. He 
hadn’t meant it to go like this. “I’m 
not going to hurt you. Mom. It’s all 
right.” 

She ignored the word and strug- 
gled, but there was no strength in 
her and she knew it. 

“Please,’’ Jeff said gently. 
“Look at my face. You recognize 
me, don’t you?” 

She shook her head and the rest 
of her body shook too. 

He kept a firm hold on her 
wrists. “Here,” he said, “the scar 
on my nose where Trixie bit me 
when I was seven. I have a birth- 
mark on my left shoulderblade that 
looks like a rabbit’s head. I con- 
tracted measles on the first day of 
kindergarten and you played the 
dulcimer for me and sang the old 
songs, trying to make me feel bet- 
ter. ’ ’ 

He watched her emotions shift 
from disbelief to almost-rec- 

78 



ognition — before they clouded 
with fear. 

“Let me go,” she said quietly. 
“I don’t know who you are or what 
you want. Let me go!’’ She 
squirmed convulsively to get away 
from him, but he held her. 

“You don’t understand now,” he 
said, “and I can’t blame you for 
that. But come with me, just a little 
way down the road, and I’ll show 
you something that will make you 
understand.” 

She remained silent, helpless, so 
he let go one of her hands and put 
his arm around her, pulling her 
along the road with him, talking 
softly the while. “Don’t be 
frightened by what you’ll see. 
When you saw it yesterday you 
called it a ‘flying saucer’ but it’s 
really a time transport capsule.” He 
could feel a long shudder go 
through her body and wished he had 
brought the medication with him. 
She was so thin, so sick, and this 
tension wasn’t going to help her 
condition. “There are some others 
with me. Don’t be afraid of them. 
They’re human beings. We’ve all 
come here to help you.” 

She was sobbing softly, tears 
streaming down her cheeks, and she 
seemed dazed. 

“You’re my mother,” he said. 
“I wouldn’t hurt you for anything 
in the world.” 

“Then let me go home.” 

Anger was rising in him, a des- 
perate frustration with her needless 
fear. He hadn’t hurt her. Surely she 



GALAXY 




could sense his good intentions even 
if she couldn’t seem to accept his re- 
semblance to the son she knew. 
Was she too stupid to be curious? 
To at least find out what this mys- 
tery was all about? Somehow he 
had thought there would be a strong 
bond . .recognition . between 
them the moment they met, but she 
was not as he remembered, and ob- 
viously she felt no kinship to him. 
And how do you talk to a memory? 
But then he considered why he was 
here and what it had taken to get 
him here, and he tried again, speak- 
ing gently. 

“You can go home, Mom, if 
that’s what you want. You can go 
right back home just as soon as I’ve 
explained things to you. On the 
transport. Look, it’s over there.” 
He pointed to the edge of the woods 
where the silver disk was just visi- 
ble through the trees. When his 
mother saw it she struggled again, 
but he kept his arm firmly around 
her and one hand on her wrist so 
that she had to let him take her 
across the field. He was thankful 
that at least she wasn’t screaming. 

As soon as they reached the 
transport, the port opened, and 
McCoy led his mother through. She 
stopped struggling when she saw 
Wolford and Vahran waiting for 
them and leaned suddenly against 
Jeff as if for protection. He 
loosened his grasp on her wrist, but 
kept an arm around her still. 
“Mother, this is Captain Wolford 
and Lieutenant Vahran.”

Wolford’s ruddy face attempted a 
warm smile, but Vahran only nod- 
ded. 

“In here, Mom,” McCoy said, 
leading her to the doorslit of the 
inner cabin, pausing until it dilated 
sufficiently to admit both of them 
together. His mother stared as they 
went through and gasped as it 
closed behind them. McCoy led her 
to one of the chairs and she col- 
lapsed into it. He then found his kit, 
extracted what he wanted, and 
handed it to her. She held it 
listlessly on her open palm, barely 
glancing at it as she gazed be- 
musedly around the cabin at the 
darkened viewscreens, the army of 
meters, the softly glowing walls. 

“Look at it,” he told her, point-

ing to the tranquillizer he had given 
her. It was shaped like a flower bud 
on a short stem, pale pink with light 
green petals. As it took warmth 
from her hand it opened into a frilly 
blossom that gave off a strong, 
sweet fragrance. In spite of her 
nervousness, she lifted the flower 
cautiously to her nose and sniffed 
it. She didn’t notice when part of 
the ‘stem’ melted into her 
palm . 

Thank God, McCoy thought. The 
gadget he had devised to sedate 
children and psychotics without 
force was proving invaluable again. 
He talked as he waited for the drug 
to relax her, knowing that there was 
little time left before they would 
have to return to the transfer point. 
“Now do you see?’’ he said. 
“There’s nothing and nobody here 
to hurt you.” 

She held out her palm with the 
flower in it. “Is this what you want 
to show me? Magic tricks?” 

“Of course not. That’s not im- 
portant. What is important is that 
you realize I’m your son.” 

She shook her head. “My son is 
Jeff, my only child. He’s at school 
now.” 

“That’s true,” Jeff said, “but 
it’s only partly true. I am Jeff, only 
I’m the grown-up Jeff. I come from 
the future. In my time it’s the year 
2009, and I’m forty-three years 
old.” He touched her cheek. “Look 
at me. Can’t you see I’ve only 
changed a little bit? I’ve only grown 
up, Mom.” 



She lifted her eyes and stared at 
him, and said nothing. 

“In my present time there’s a 
way to return to the past. That’s 
what I’ve done. I’ve come back to 
ask you to go with me to my 
time . .to the future.” 

Unexpectedly, she laughed, in the 
way she had when he had been very 
small and had told her his fantastic 
dreams. “That’s some story, Mis- 
ter,” she said. “Wait until I tell 
Jeff about this. And we all thought 
you were little green men from 
Mars.” 

McCoy sighed. “I want you to 
come back to 2009 with me. Mom. 
I want to buy you a new house and 
make your life easy from now on. 
You need medical attention, and I 
can give you the best. You can live 
a long and happy life if you’ll come 
with me now.” 

She shook her head slowly, still 
smiling. “Little green men, we 
thought, and here you look just like 

us.” 

There was a slight swooshing sound 
and the doorslit to the control room 
opened to admit Captain Wolford. He 
looked from one to the other and then 
spoke quietly. “Three minutes, Dr. 
McCoy.” 

McCoy nodded. “Come here for 
a moment, will you. Captain?” 

W'olford stepped forward a few 
paces and stood waiting. 

“Will you tell her, please, where 
we come from, and who we are?” 

“Project Anachron,” Wolford 
said. “Travel to the past.”

“And who am I?” 

“Doctor Jeffrey McCoy.” 

“Thank you,” McCoy said. “We 
can leave now, Captain.” 

His mother jumped up suddenly, 
visibly fighting the effects of the 
tranquilizer. “No! I’ve got to get 
home. You can’t start this thing 
going until I get off!” She moved 
toward the doorslit to the outer pas- 
sage, but McCoy stepped in front of 
her, blocking her way. 

“You’re coming with us, whether 
you want to or not,” he said 
sternly. “You'll be glad you did, 
later.” He nodded to the captain. 
“It’s okay. I’ll get her fastened into 
the chair.” 

Wolford stepped back through the 
doorslit. 

“You lied to me!” his mother 
sobbed as McCoy pushed her gently 
into the chair and fastened the 
safety straps around her. “You 
lied! You said I could go home!” 
“I’m sorry,” he said. 

“But Jeff needs me. I can’t leave 
him.” 

McCoy finished with her straps 
and then reclined in his own chair 
next to hers. “It’s all right, Mom. I 
went to live with your parents. 
Grandpa and Grandma were good to 
me. I was happy with them.” He 
swung the chair around so he could 
see her face. She was very white 
but she was listening to him now, 
perhaps even believing him. He 
went on. “My father left us, you 
know. It was the same day — ” he 
stopped, looked at her, and then 



continued. “It was a week before 
my birthday. That would be to- 
day . this morning. He didn’t 
even wait to eat breakfast. Just got 
into the Ford and drove away.” 

“He’ll be back.” She was crying 
hard, her voice breaking. 

“No, not this time. And so I 
went to live with Grandma and 
Grandpa. So you see, Mom, there’s 
nothing for you to go back to. No- 
body needs you there, but / want 
you here . ’ ’ 

A red glow filled the room and a 
humming started, and now the view- 
ers around them and under them 
were turning on like windows to the 
world outside, showing them the 
bleak trees, the rutted ground, the 
chill morning, and the uneven roof 
of the old house. 

The woman struggled to a sitting 
position, the chair forming itself 
around her as she moved, and she 
watched the house receding below 
them until it was only a speck. 
Then she turned horrified eyes to 
McCoy. 

“You’re a liar! You have nothing 
to do with me or my son. You’re a 
lying, rotten, stinking ” 

He leaned over and grabbed the 
fist she was shaking at him, anger 
and disappointment loud in his 
voice. “Don’t you know why I’m 
taking you with me? Don’t you 
know why I’ve spent years planning 
for this moment? Can’t you feel 
what’s going to happen to you? 
Then let me tell you I’ve had to 
beg, to bribe, to toady and crawl, to

plead and bargain with people 1 hate 
just to be able to come back here 
and save you. Are you too stupid to 
see how important this is to me, 
and to you, and to that little boy 
back there?” Suddenly he became 
conscious that he was hurting her 
hand and released it. But she would 
have to hear the rest now. He 
hadn’t planned to tell her, ever, but 
he had to make her understand. He 
lowered his voice. ‘‘I did all that, 
Mother, to save your life — to give 
you a new life. That’s why I’m not 
going to send you back there to die. 
Because you did die that day — 
today — October 10, 1976.” 

She was staring at him, eyes 
wide with disbelief. “What are you 
talking about?” 

‘‘I’m telling you that I’m saving 
your life! If you had left this trans- 
port and gone back to that house, 
you would have died in about five 
hours. And that’s why we have to 
hurry; I want you in the hospital 
when your body fails.” 

She shook her head violently. 
“No!” 

“Yes!” He wasn’t angry any 
more. Now he was so close to her, 
now that he’d seen the old house 
again just as it had been on that last 
day of her life, the same feelings 
came flooding back to him and he 
spoke to her with all the heartache 
he had known then. ‘‘He got up 
that morning and started drinking 
again, and he was cussing and slap- 
ping you around until both of us 
were crying, and then he got into 



the car and left. I didn’t want to go 
to school but you made me eat my 
mush and get on the bus. And when 
I got home it was raining, and you 
weren’t waiting for me on the 
porch, but I thought it was because 
of the rain. I went into the kitchen, 
but you weren’t there, and then I 
went into the bedroom. You were 
lying on the bed. I knew right away 
that . that you weren’t alive. I 
don’t remember how, but I got 
someone to help and they called an 
ambulance. The doctor said it 
would have happened whether I’d 
been there or not, because you were 
so sick. He called it ‘cardiac arrest.’ 
I didn’t know then that that was just 
dog-Latin for ‘the heart stopped 
beating’ — but I always thought that 
if I’d been there with you I could 
have saved you somehow.” He 
buried his face in his hands. ‘‘You 
never even owned a washing 
machine. ” 

He could hear her low voice. 
‘‘He’s not a bad man. It’s just so 
hard on him, the bad times and 
all . .” 

‘‘He should have taken you to a 
doctor. He knew you’d been sick 
for a long time, but he wouldn’t do 
even that much for you.” 

‘‘No, honey. Don’t.” The 
woman reached out, and McCoy 
felt gentle hands stroking his hair. 

He lifted his head and looked at 
her. ‘‘Then you do believe me? 
You know who I am?”

There was a welcoming commit- 
tee of one as the T.T.C. 
materialized in its home station. 
Vahran could see the tall figure of 
Greg Powers coming toward them 
as he and Wolford stood at the port. 
They exchanged brief greetings and 
then Wolford told him what had 
happened. 

Powers nodded. “I hope it was 
over quickly,” he said. ‘‘How’s 
McCoy?” 

‘‘He’s inside with the body. He’s 
taking it pretty hard.” 

‘‘Of course,” Powers said. He 
patted Vahran’s shoulder. ‘‘Thank 
you. It couldn’t have been pleasant 
for either of you. Your bonus 
checks will be waiting the minute 
we finish up.” 

‘‘When will that be?” Vahran 
asked. 

“That depends on Jeff . how 
quickly I can convince him to get 
his mother’s body back to her own 
time. Why don’t you take a couple 
hours break and report back? I’ll let 
you know then.” He clapped Vah- 
ran on the shoulder again, and went 
into the transport. 

Vahran and Wolford walked 
slowly through the garage-like 
building and turned into a hallway 
full of people who rushed blindly 
past, intent on their own errands 
amid the sounds of clicking au- 
totypers and chiming phones. 

“Well,” Wolford said, “every- 
thing seems to be the same here in 
good old 2009. Feel better?” 

Vahran nodded. “I felt better as 

A LITTLE BIT OF RECYCLED TIME 






soon as McCoy used the tranquil- 
lizer on her.” 

Wolford shrugged. “We put 
poison into every bit of medication 
he had with him, remember?” 

‘‘But I kept thinking . suppose 
he doesn’t give her any? Suppose 
we’d had to slip an injection into 
her? Suppose he caught us at it?” 
Vahran ran the back of his hand 
across his forehead. ‘‘I don’t know. 
I feel less like a murderer this 
way.” 

“We’re not murderers,” Wolford 
said flatly. 

“We’ll be debating that point for 
the rest of our lives, and you know 
it.” 

Wolford shook his head. “You 
can’t murder someone who died 
thirty-four years ago.” 

Vahran wrinkled his forehead and 
followed the captain out of the 
building, into the sunshine. 

* * ★ 

They made the return trip to Oc- 
tober 10, 1976 the next morning, 
arranging to arrive thirty minutes 
later than their previous departure. 
Together McCoy and Powers pro- 
ceeded to carry the woman’s body 
into the house to lay it on the bed 
in readiness for that younger Jeff’s 
return. 

As the transport’s outer slit irised 
shut behind McCoy and Powers, 
Vahran turned to his Captain. “Did 
you hear what McCoy said — about 



the autopsy? Did you hear?” Vahran 
knew he sounded hysterical, but 
now that McCoy was out of the 
ship he had to speak. 

Wolford eyed him warily. “What 
are you talking about?” 

“Cardiac arrest; her heart just 
stopped beating. McCoy said it was 
just like that old-time sawbones had 
claimed — that it must have been 
Fate, that there was no discernable 
reason for her to have died, but that 
she died anyway.” Vahran broke 
off, tried to get a grip on himself. 

“So?” Wolford shrugged. “The 
poison short-circuits the autonomous 
nervous system for a few minutes, 
then disappears without a trace. 
Powers was thorough.” 

“Idiot!” Vahran was suddenly 
indifferent to the other’s rank. 
“Can’t you see? There was no prox- 
imate cause of death. Oh, sure, 
her lungs were rotten with tuber- 
culosis and she suffered from per- 
nicious anemia, but she would have 
lived for at least a year — barring 
our intervention. 

“But she did die. Before we ever 
got involved. On October 10, 1976. 
Before we were even born . .” 
Captain Wolford stopped speaking 
as he began to understand. 

“That’s right! She always died 
on October 10, 1976, before we 
were born. Because we always kill- 
ed her.” 

Vahran ’s words were a cry of ter- 
ror, and he saw that terror mirrored 
in Wolford’s eyes, as together they 
stared into the abyss. ★

Part III of III 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Transported by one of Dworkin’s 
Trumps to the verge of Chaos, I re- 
garded an unsteady landscape beneath 
a sky split down the middle — half the 
sky was of night, with shifting stars; 
half, a riot of writhing colors. It 
seemed to rotate about a point directly 
overhead. Beyond the chasm beside 
which I stood, something hovered on a 
distant mount of black. A city? A 
citadel? 

As I watched, I detected moving 
points of light passing along gauzy 
strands within the abyss. One such 
strand drifted near and a ghostly 
horseman moved along it, coming in 
my direction. He demanded my name 
and challenged me when I refused to 
supply it. We fought. He recognized 
my blade, Grayswandir, called me 
Corwin, and tried to back out. But it 
was too late. Both he and his horse 
burned as they were wounded and fell 
into the abyss. 

Another horseman followed — human 
in appearance, mounted on a more 
mundane steed. He bore a crossbow 
with which he apparently intended to 
dispatch me. He too, however, recog- 
nized Grayswandir and changed his 
mind. He warned me away and de- 
parted. 

I scouted the area quickly after that, 
mounting to a greater prominence 
from which I confirmed a suspicion 
that the black road passed this far and 
on out across the abyss to the dark 
place. I attempted to contact Random 
then, but he was in the midst of a hell- 
ride. Finally, / was able to raise 
Gerard and he trumped me back to 
Amber. There, I learned that eight 



days had gone by, rather than the few 
hours I had personally passed. 

Brand, Gerard told me, had been 
asking for me. Benedict had returned 
from his journey wearing the arm I 
had brought back from Tir-na N'og’th. 
Random had done the surgery before 
continuing on in his search for his son 
Martin. 

I went to see Brand, who had appar- 
ently been brooding in his quarters 
despite making a good recovery from 
his injury. He berated me for not keep- 
ing him up to date on affairs. I con- 
fronted him with Martin’s Trump and 
my suspicions concerning it. He admit- 
ted both the authorship of the card and 
the stabbing of Martin. He protested, 
however, that this was prior to his 
change of heart/mind concerning the 
conspiracy to which he had been party. 
He then told me he had determined 
that Bleys was still living and was pre- 
paring for a new assault on Amber. He 
requested my cooperation in disposing 
of both Bleys and Fiona. I refused and 
he grew angry. He wanted particulars 
on Benedict’s new arm, on my visit to 
Tir-na Nog’th and the identities of my 
companions when I had visited the 
primal Pattern. I let him know that 
Random had been with me when the 
damaged Trump had been located, just 
to keep him on edge, declined furnish- 
ing information on the rest and de- 
parted. 

I had a quick meal then and rode 
down to the place where Ganelon and 
my troops were camped. Ganelon con- 
tacted me en route, via a set of Trumps 
he had recently acquired, and in- 
formed me that something had come 
up and that he would tell me more 
when I arrived. It turned out that Ben- 
edict was with him. Benedict had fi- 
nally been convinced of Dara’s ex- 



86 



GALAXY 




istence and had apparently accepted 
the possibility that she might be of his 
own blood. He wanted my recollections 
of her. After hearing them, he told me 
of Random’s quest for his son, heard 
my account of my journey to the 
Courts of Chaos, expressed a desire to 
carry the battle to that place and bor- 
rowed the new Trump for purposes of 
personally reconnoitering it. He used 
his new hand perfectly. 

I told Benedict that the damage to 
the Pattern might be the major cause 
of our current problems, and of the 
possibility that it could be repaired. He 
agreed not to attack the Courts of 
Chaos without first conferring with 
me, in return for my not fooling with 
the Pattern without telling him. 

I was about to depart then, to return 
to the shadow Earth for the Jewel of 
Judgment, when Gerard contacted Ben- 
edict and had him bring him through 
on his Trump. Gerard then accused me 
of foul play back in Amber. I was the 
last person he knew of to see Brand, 
and Brand was now missing, his room 
a mess complete with bloodstains. I 
could not convince him of my inno- 
cence, and we fought. I was getting 
the worst of it when Ganelon stepped 
in and managed to beat Gerard uncon- 
scious. 

I departed on my journey im- 
mediately after that, entering Arden 
and following the trail which took me 
west, then north, about the foot of 
Kolvir. 

During the course of my ride, I 
heard a hunting horn followed by the 
haying of the stormhounds. It could 
only be my brother Julian. I fled, 
working some premature twistings of 
Shadow, but the pursuit continued. 
Only at the last possible moment did I 
realize that I was not the quarry. Ju- 



lian was pursuing a manticora, which 
seemed to have been pursuing me. He 
and the hounds succeeded in dispatch- 
ing it. 

After that, we talked. He was 
pleased to know that he was no longer 
under suspicion for Brand’s stabbing, 
less pleased to know that Brand had 
survived. He admitted he would have 
done it if he had had the opportunity. 
He then told me a different version of 
events leading up to and following my 
return. He acknowledged the existence 
of the two groups — himself, Caine and 
Eric opposing Bleys, Brand and 
Fiona — in the struggle for the throne. 
He even took personal responsibility 
for my blinding, as the only means he 
had seen to save my life. He indicated 
that Brand was the major villain in the 
piece, however, telling me then of his 
powers — powers which made him into 
something like a living Trump. 

I told him of recent developments 
and of my search for the Jewel of 
Judgment. He opined that Brand could 
not summon such an item from 
Shadow, but would have to go after it 
personally. He sent me on my way 
then with something I’d never had 
from him before: his good wishes. 

I hellrode to the shadow Earth and 
visited my old home there. It was being 
repaired for sale, and the compost 
heap in which I had hidden the Jewel 
was gone. I rode into town, to Bill 
Roth’s place. He wanted the story I 
had promised him and I still hadn’t the 
time to tell it. He phoned the 
contractor — Ed Wellen, a man I had 
once known — and learned that Ed had 
hauled the heap away himself, for per- 
sonal use. We headed for Ed’s place in 
a hurry then, because we also learned 
that a redheaded artist had been paint- 
ing in that same field that day, a man 



THE HAND OF OBERON 



87 




who had also looked at the house ear- 
lier, a man who might have been 
Brand. 

I risked contact with Gerard, who 
seemed somewhat placated, and per- 
suaded him to see that the Patterns in 
Amber and Rebma were kept guarded 
from Brand. 

Bill and I got to Ed’s place quickly, 
began looking, soon realized that the 
Jewel was gone. Gerard got in contact 
about that time, saying that Brand had 
indeed shown up in the chamber of the 
Pattern, but seeing that it was guarded 
had departed. 

Immediately after this, Fiona got in 
touch with me. I brought her through 
and she guided me through places of 
Shadow back toward the primal Pat- 
tern. On the way, she told me more 
about the accident. It had been Brand, 
not Bleys, who had shot out my tires. 
It was Bleys who had called the cops. I 
had dragged myself out of the wreck. I 
had been getting shock treatments in 
Porter, where Brand had had me 
committed, not for purposes of restor- 
ing my memories, but rather to destroy 
memories which had begun returning 
on their own. After I escaped, Brand 
had then tried to kill me because he 
didn’t want me returning. 

When we reached the place of the 
primal Pattern, Brand was already into 
it, the Jewel about his neck for pur- 
poses of attunement. I pursued him 
through the Pattern. Fighting under a 
handicap, because I could only let his 
blood fall in the dark area, so as not to 
damage the Pattern further, I used the 
Jewel he was wearing to summon a 
vortex like that which had destroyed 
Random’s horse I ago. When he had 
me at a disadvantage and was about to 
press it, Brand’s blade was struck by 
lightning and he realized what I had 



unleashed above him. Entering the 
black area, he exercised his powers to 
save himself just as the vortex de- 
scended. 

I had no choice then but to complete 
the Pattern myself in order to get out. 
There is no turning back. 

XII. 

Late afternoon on a mountain: 
the westering sun shone full on the 
rocks to my left, tailored long 
shadows for those to the right; it fil- 
tered through the foliage about my 
tomb; it countered to some extent 
the chill winds of Kolvir. I released 
Random’s hand and turned to regard 
the man who sat on the bench be- 
fore the mausoleum. 

It was the face of the youth on 
the pierced Trump, lines now drawn 
above the mouth, brow heavier, a 
general wariness in eye movement 
and set of jaw which had not been 
apparent on the card. 

So I knew it before Random said, 
“This is my son Martin.” 

Martin rose as I approached him, 
clasped my hand, said, “Uncle 
Corwin.” His expression changed 
but slightly as he said it. He 
scrutinized me. 

He was several inches taller than 
Random, but of the same light 
build. His chin and cheekbones had 
the same general cut to them, his 
hair was of a similar texture. 

I smiled. 

“You have been away a long 
while,” I said. “So was I.” 

He nodded. 

“But I have never really been in 
Amber proper,” he said. “I grew, 
up in Rebma — and other places.” I 

“Then let me welcome youJ 



88 



Ci Al AYY 




nephew. You come at an interesting 
time. Random must have told you 
about it.” 

“Yes,” he said. “That is why 1 
asked to meet you here, rather than 
there.” 

I glanced at Random. 

“The last uncle he met was 
Brand,” Random said, “and under 
very nasty circumstances. Do you 
blame him?” 

“Hardly. I ran into him myself a 
bit earlier. Can’t say it was the 
most rewarding encounter.” 

“Ran into him?” said Random. 
“You’ve lost me.” 

“He has left Amber and he has 
the Jewel of Judgment with him. If 
I had known earlier what I know 
now, he would still be in the tower. 
He is our man, and he is very 
dangerous.” 

Random nodded. 

“I know,” he said. “Martin con- 
firmed all our suspicions on the 
stabbing — and it was Brand. But 
what is this about the Jewel?” 

“He beat me to the place where I 
had left it on the shadow Earth. He 
has to walk the Pattern with it and 
project himself through it, though, 
to attune it to his use. I just stopped 
him from doing that on the primal 
Pattern in the real Amber. He es- 
caped, however. I was just over the 
hiJ'l with Gerard, sending a squad of 
guards through to Fiona in that 
place, to prevent his returning and 
trying again. Our own Pattern and 
that in Rebma are also under guard 
because of him.” 

“Why does he want so badly to 
attune it? So he can raise a few 
storms? Hell, he could take a walk 
in Shadow and make all the weather 
he wants.” 



“A person attuned to the Jewel 
could use it to erase the Pattern.” 
“Oh? What happens then?” 

“The world as we know it comes 
to an end.” 

“Oh,” Random said again. 
Then, “How the hell do you 
know?” 

“It is a long story and I haven’t 
the time, but I had it from Dworkin 
and I believe that much of what he 
said is true.” 

“He’s still around?” 

“Later,” I said. 

“Okay. But Brand would have to 
be mad to do something like that.” 

I nodded. 

“I believe he thinks he could 
then cast a new Pattern, redesign 
the universe with himself as chief 
executive.” 

“Could this be done?” 
“Theoretically, perhaps. But 
even Dworkin has certain doubts 
that the feat could be repeated effec- 
tively now. The combination of fac- 
tors was unique. — Yes, I believe 
Brand is somewhat mad. Looking 
back over the years, recalling his 
personality changes, his cycles of 
moods, it seems there was some- 
thing of a schizoid pattern there. I 
do not know whether the deal he 
made with the enemy pushed him 
over the edge or not. It does not re- 
ally matter. I wish he were back in 
his tower. I wish Gerard were a 
worse physician.” 

“Do you know who stabbed 
him?” 

“Fiona. You can get the story 
from her, though.” 

H? leaned against my epitaph and 
shook his head. 

“Brand,” he said. “Damn him. 
Any one of us might have killed 



THE HAND OF OBERON 



89 




him on a number of occasions — in 
the old days. Just when he would 
get you mad enough, though, he 
would change. After awhile, you 
would get to thinking he wasn’t 
such a bad guy after all. Too bad he 
didn’t push one of us just a little 
harder at the wrong time. .” 

“Then I take it he is now fair 
game?” said Martin. 

I looked at him. The muscles in 
his jaws had tightened and his eyes 
were narrowed. For a moment, all 
of our faces fled across his, like a 
riffling of the family cards. All of 
our egoism, hatred, envy, pride and 
abuse seemed to flow by in that 
instant — and he had not even set 
foot in Amber yet. Something snap- 
ped inside me and I reached out and 
seized him by the shoulders. 

“You have good reason to hate 
him,” I said, “and the answer to 
your question is ‘yes’. The hunting 
season is open. I see no way to deal 
with him other than to destroy him. 
I hated him myself for so long as he 
remained an abstraction. But — 
now — it is different. Yes, he must 
be killed. But do not let that hatred 
be your baptism into our company. 
There has been too much of it 
among us. I look at your face — I 
don’t know. I am sorry, Martin. 
Too much is going on right now. 
You are young. I have seen more 
things. Some of them bother me — 
differently. That’s all.” 

1 released my grip and stepped 
back. 

“Tell me about yourself,” I said. 

“I was afraid of Amber for a 
long while,” he began, “and I 
guess that I still am. Ever since he 
attacked me, I have been wondering 
whether Brand might catch up with 

90 



me again. I have been looking over 
my shoulder for years. 1 have been 
afraid of all of you, I suppose. I 
knew most of you as pictures on 
cards — with bad reputations at- 
tached. I told Random — Dad — that I 
did not want to meet you all at 
once, and he suggested that I see 
you first. Neither of us realiz.ed at 
the time that you would be particu- 
larly interested in certain things that 
I know. After I mentioned them 
though, Dad said I had to see you 
as soon as possible. He has been 
telling me all about what has been 
going on and — you see, I know 
something about it.” 

“I had a feeling that you 
might — when a certain name crop- 
ped up not too long ago.” 

“The Tecys?” Random said. 

“The same.” 

“It is difficult, deciding where to 
start. Martin said. 

“I know that you grew up in Reb- 
ma, walked the Pattern and then 
used your power over Shadow to 
visit Benedict in Avalon,” I said. 
“Benedict told you more about 
Amber and Shadow, taught you the 
use of the Trumps, coached you in 
weaponry. Later, you departed to 
walk in Shadow by yourself. And I 
know what Brand did to you. That 
is the sum of my knowledge.” 

He nodded, stared off into the 
west. 

“After I left Benedict’s, I 
traveled for years in Shadow,” he 
said. “Those were the happiest 
times I have known. Adventure, ex- 
citement, new things to see, to 
do. In the back of my mind, I 
always had it that one day when I 
was smarter and tougher — more 
experienced — I would journey to 



GALAXY 




Amber and meet my other relatives. 
Then Brand caught up with me. I 
was camped on a little hillside, just 
resting from a long ride and taking 
my lunch, on my way to visit my 
friends the Tecys. I had known 
them, through Benedict, for some 
lime. Brand contacted me then. I 
had reached Benedict with his 
Trump, when he was teaching me 
how to use them, and other times 
when I had traveled. He had even 
transported me through occasion- 
ally, so I knew what it felt like, 
knew what it was all about. This 
lelt the same way, and for a mo- 
ment I thought that somehow it was 
Benedict calling me. But no. It was 
Brand — I recognized him from his 
picture in the deck. He was stand- 
ing in the midst of what seemed to 
be the Pattern. I was curious. I did 
not know how he had reached me. 
So far as I knew, there was no 
frump for me. He talked for a 
minute — I forget what he said — and 
when everything was firm and 
clear, he — he stabbed me. I pushed 
him and pulled away then. He held 
the contact somehow. It was hard 
for me to brealk it — and when I did, 
he tried to reach me again. But I 
was able to block him. Benedict 
had taught me that. He tried again, 
several times, but I kept blocking, 
finally, he stopped. I was near to 
the Tecys. I managed to get onto 
my horse and make it to their place. 
I thought I was going to die, be- 
cause I had never been hurt that 
badly before. But after a time, I 
began to recover. Then I grew 
afraid once again, afraid that Brand 
would find me and finish what he 
had begun.” 

‘‘Why didn’t you contact Ben- 



edict,” I asked him, ‘‘and tell him 
what had happened, tell him of your 
fears?” 

‘‘I thought of that,” he said, 
‘‘and I also thought of the possibil- 
ity that Brand believed he had suc- 
ceeded, that I was indeed dead. I 
did not know what sort of power 
struggle was going on in Amber, 
but I decided that the attempt on my 
life was probably part of such a 
thing. Benedict had told me enough 
about the family that this was one 
of the first things to come to mind. 
So I decided that perhaps it would 
be better to remain dead. I left the 
Tecys before I was completely re- 
covered, and rode off to lose myself 
in Shadow. 

“I happened upon a strange thing 
then,” he continued, ‘‘a thing I had 
never before encountered, but which 
now seemed virtually omnipresent: 
In nearly all of the shadows through 
which I passed, there was a peculiar 
black road existing in some form or 
other. I did not understand it, but 
since it was the only thing I had 
come across which seemed to 
traverse Shadow itself, my curiosity 
was aroused. I resolved to follow it 
and learn more about it. It was 
dangerous. I learned very quickly 
not to tread the thing. Strange 
shapes seemed to travel it at night. 
Natural creatures which ventured 
upon it sickened and died. So I was 
careful. I went no nearer than was 
necessary to keep it in sight. I fol- 
lowed it through many places. I 
quickly learned that everywhere it 
ran there was death, desolation or 
trouble nearby. I did not know what 
to make of it. 

‘‘I was still weak from my 
wound,” he went on, ‘‘and I made 



THE HAND OF OBERON 



91 




the mistake of pressing myself, of 
riding too far, too fast, in a day’s 
time. That evening, I fell ill and I 
lay shivering in my blanket through 
the night and much of the next day. 

I was into and out of delirium dur- 
ing this time, so I do not know 
exactly when she appeared. She 
seemed like part of my dream much 
of the while. A young girl. Pretty. 
She took care of me while I recov- 
ered. Her name was Dara. We 
talked interminably. It was very 
pleasant. Having someone to talk 
with like that. .1 must have told 
her my whole life story. Then she 
told me something of herself. She 
was not a native of the area in 
which I had collapsed. She said that 
she had traveled there through 
Shadow. She could not yet walk 
through it as we do, though she felt 
she could learn to do this, as she 
claimed descent from the House of 
Amber through Benedict. In fact, 
she wanted very badly to learn how 
it was done. Her means of travel 
then was the black road itself. She 
was immune to its noxious effects, 
she said, because she was also re- 
lated to the dwellers at its farther 
end, in the Courts of Chaos. She 
wanted to learn our ways though, so 
I did my best to instruct her in 
those things that I did know. I told 
her of the Pattern, even sketched it 
for her. I showed her my 
Trumps — Benedict had given me a 
deck — to show her the appearance 
of her other relatives. She was par- 
ticularly interested in yours.” 

“I begin to understand,” I said. 
“Go on.” 

“She told me that Amber, in the 
fullness of its corruption and pre- 
sumption, had upset a kind of 

92 



metaphysical balance between itself 
and the Courts of Chaos. Her 
people now had the job of redres- 
sing the matter by laying waste to 
Amber. Their own place is not a 
shadow of Amber, but a solid entity 
in its own right. In the meantime, 
all of the intervening shadows are 
suffering because of the black road. 
My knowledge of Amber being 
what it was, I could only listen. At 
first, I accepted everything that she 
said. Brand, to me, certainly fit her 
description of evil in Amber. But 
when I mentioned him, she said no. 
He was some sort of hero back 
where she hied from. She was un- 
certain as to the particulars, but it 
did not trouble her all that much. It 
was then that I realized how over- 
sure she seemed about every- 
thing — there was a ring of the 
fanatic when she talked. Almost 
unwillingly, I found myself trying 
to defend Amber. I thought of 
Llewella and of Benedict — and of 
Gerard, whom I had met a few 
times. She was eager to learn of 
Benedict, I discovered. That proved 
the soft spot in her armor. Here I 
could speak with some knowledge, 
and here she was willing to believe 
the good things I had to say. So, I 
do not know what the ultimate ef- 
fect of all this talk was, except that 
she seemed somewhat less sure of 
herself near the end. 

“The end?” I said. “What do 
you mean? How long was she with 
you?” 

“Almost a week,” he replied. 
“She had said she would take care 
of me until I was recovered, and 
she did. Actually, she remained 
several days longer. She said that 
was just to be sure, but I think it 



GALAXY 





was really that she wanted to con- 
tinue our conversations. Finally 
though, she said that she had to be 
moving on. I asked her to stay with 
me, but she said no. I offered to go 
with her, but she said no to that, 
too. She must have realized that I 
planned to follow her then, because 
she slipped away during the night. I 
could not ride the black road, and I 
had no idea what shadow she would 
travel to next on her way to Amber. 
When I awoke in the morning and 
realized she had gone, I thought for 
a time of visiting Amber myself. 
But I was still afraid. Perhaps some 
of the things she had said had rein- 
forced my own fears. Whatever, I 
decided to remain in Shadow. And 
so I traveled on, seeing things, try- 
ing to learn things — until Random 
found me and told me he wanted 
me to come home. He brought me 
here first though, to meet you, be- 
cause he wanted you to hear my 
story before any of the others. He 
said that you knew Dara, that you 
wanted to learn more about her. I 
hope that I have helped.” 

“Yes,” I said. “Thank you.” 

“I understand that she did finally 
walk the Pattern.” 

“Yes, she succeeded in that.” 
“And afterwards delcared herself 
an enemy of Amber.” 

“That, too.” 

“I hope,” he said, “that she 
comes to no harm by all this. She 
was kind to me.” 

“She seems quite able to take 
care of herself,” I said. “But. 
Yes, she is a likable girl. I cannot 
promise you anything concerning 
her safety, because I still know so 
little about her, so little of her part 
in everything that is going on. Yet, 



THE HAND OF OBERON 



what you have told me has been 
helpful. It makes her someone I 
would still like to grant doubt’s 
benefit, as far as I can.” 

He smiled. 

“Iam glad to hear that.” 

I shrugged. 

“What are you going to do 
now?” I asked. 

“I am taking him to meet Vialle,” 
Ramon said, “and then the others, 
as time and opportunity permit. 
Unless, of course, something 
new has developed and you need 
me now.” 

“There have been new develop- 
ments,” I said, “but I do not really 
need you' now. I had better bring 
you up to date, though. I still have 
a little time.” 

As I filled Random in on events 
since his departure, I thought about 
Martin. He was still an unknown 
quantity so far as I was concerned. 
His story might be perfectly true. In 
fact, I felt that it was. On the other 
hand, I had a feeling that it was not 
complete, that he was intentionally 
leaving something out. Maybe 
something harmless. Then again, 
maybe not. He had no real reason 
to love us. Quite the contrary. And 
Random could be bringing home a 
Trojan Horse. Probably though, it 
was nothing like that. It is just that 
I never trust anyone if there is an 
alternative available. 

Still, nothing that I was telling 
Random could really be used 
against us, and I strongly doubted 
that Martin could do us much dam- 
age if that was his intention. No, 
more likely he was being as cagey 
as the rest of us, and for pretty 
much the same reasons: fear and 
self-preservation. On a sudden in- 

94 



spiration, I asked him, “Did you 
ever run into Dara again after 
that?” 

He flushed. 

“No,” he said, too quickly. 
“Just that time. That’s all.” 

“I see,” I said, and Random was 
too good a poker player not to have 
noticed; so I had just bought us a 
piece of instant insurance at the 
small price of putting a father on 
guard against his long-lost son. 

I quickly shifted our talk back to 
Brand. It was while we were com- 
paring notes on psychopathology 
that I felt the tiny tingle and the 
sense of presence which heralds a 
Trump contact. I raised my hand 
and turned aside. 

In a moment the contact was 
clear and Ganelon and I regarded 
one another. 

“Corwin,” he said, “I decided it 
was time to check. By now, you 
have the Jewel, Brand has the Jewel 
or you are both still looking. Which 
one is it?” 

“Brand has the Jewel,” I said. 

“More’s the pity,” he said. 
“Tell me about it.” 

So I did. 

“Then Gerard had the story 
right,” he said. 

“He’s already told you all this?” 

“Not in such detail,” Ganelon 
replied, “and I wanted to be sure I 
was getting it straight. I just 
finished speaking with him.” He 
glanced upward. “It would seem 
you had best be moving then, if my 
memories of moonrise serve me 
right.” 

I nodded. 

“Yes, I will be heading for the 
stairway shortly. It is not all that far 
from here.” 



GALAXY 




“Good. Now here is what you 
must be ready to do — ” 

‘‘1 know what I have to do,’’ I 
said. “I have to get up to Tir-na 
Nog’th before Brand does and block 
his way to the Pattern. Failing that, 

I have to chase him through it 
again.” 

“That is not the way to go about 
it,” he said. 

“You have a better idea?” 

“Yes, I do. You have your 
Trumps with you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good. First, you would not be 
able to get up there in time to block 
his way to the Pattern — ” 

“Why not?” 

“You have to make the ascen- 
sion, then you have to walk to the 
palace and make your way down to 
the Pattern. That takes time, even in 
Tir-na Nog’th — especially in Tir-na 
Nog’th, where time tends to play 
tricks anyway. For all you know, 
you may have a hidden death-wish 
slowing you down. I don’t know. 
Whatever the case, he would have 
commenced walking the Pattern by 
the time you arrived. It may well be 
that he would be too far into it for 
you to reach him this time.” 

“He will probably be tired. That 
should slow him some.” 

“No. Put yourself in his place. If 
you were Brand, wouldn’t you have 
headed for some shadow where the 
time-flow was different? Instead of 
an afternoon, he could well have 
taken several days to rest up for this 
evening’s ordeal. It is safest to as- 
sume that he will be in good 
shape.” 

“You are right,” I said. “I can’t 
count on it. Okay. An alternative I 
had entertained but would rather not 



try if it could be avoided, would be 
to kill him at a distance. Take along 
a crossbow or one of our rifles and 
simply shoot him in the midst of the 
Pattern. The thing that bothers me 
about it is the effect of our blood on 
the Pattern. It may be that it is only 
the primal Pattern that suffers from 
it, but I don’t know.” 

“That’s right. You do not 
know,” he said. “Also, I would 
not want you to rely on normal 
weapons up there. That is a peculiar 
place. You said yourself it is like a 
strange piece of Shadow drifting in 
the sky. While you figured how to 
make a rifle fire in Amber, the 
same rules may not apply up 
there.” 

“It is a risk,” I acknowledged. 

“As for the crossbow — Suppos- 
ing a sudden gust of wind deflected 
the bolt each time you shot one?” 

“I am afraid I do not follw 
you.” 

“The Jewel. He walked -it part- 
way through the primal Pattern, and 
he has had some time to experiment 
with it since then. Do you think it 
possible that he is partly attuned to 
it now?” 

“I do not know. I am not at all 
that sure how the process works.” 

“I just wanted to point out that if 
it does work that way, he may be 
able to use it to defend himself. The 
Jewel may even have other proper- 
ties you are not aware of. So what I 
am saying is that I would not want 
you to count on being able to kill 
him at a distance. And I would not 
even want you to rely on being able 
to pull the trick you did with the 
Jewel again — not if he may have 
gained some measure of control 
over it.”

“You do make things look a little 
bleaker than I had them.” 

“But possibly more realistic,” he 
said. 

“Conceded. Go on. You said you 
had a plan.” 

“That is correct. My thinking is 
that Brand must not be allowed to 
reach the Pattern at all, that once he 
sets foot upon it the probability of 
disaster goes way up.” 

“And you do not think I can get 
there in time to block him?” 

“Not if he can really transport 
himself around almost instantane- 
ously while you have to take a long 
walk. My bet is that he is just wait- 
ing for moonrise, and as soon as the 
city takes form he will be inside, 
right next to the Pattern.” 

“I see the point, but not the an- 
swer.” 

“The answer is that you are not 
going to set foot in Tir-na Nog’th 
tonight. ” 

“Hold on a minute!” 

“Hold on, hell! You imported a 
master strategist, you’d better listen 
to what he has to say.” 

“Okay, I am listening.” 

“You have agreed that you prob- 
ably cannot reach the place in time. 
But someone else can.” 

“Who and how?” 

“All right. I have been in touch 
with Benedict. He has returned. At 
this moment, he is in Amber, down 
in the chamber of the Pattern. By 
now, he should have finished walk- 
ing it and be standing there at its 
center, waiting. You proceed to the 
foot of the stair to the sky city. 
There you await the rising of the 
moon. As soon as Tir-na Nog’th 
takes form, you will contact Ben- 
edict via his Trump. You tell him 

96 



that all is ready, and he will use the 
power of the Pattern in Amber to 
transport himself to the place of the 
Pattern in Tir-na Nog’th. No matter 
how fast Brand travels, he cannot 
gain much on that.” 

“I see the advantages,” 1 said. 
“That is the fastest way to get a 
man up there and Benedict is cer- 
tainly a good man. He should have 
no trouble dealing with Brand.” 

“Do you really think Brand will 
make no other preparations?” Gane- 
lon said. “From everything I’ve 
heard about the man, he’s smart 
even if he is daft. He just may an- 
ticipate something like this.” 

“Possibly. Any idea what he 
might do?” 

He made a sweeping gesture with 
one hand, slapped his neck and 
smiled. 

“A bug,” he said. “Pardon me. 
Pesky little things.” 

“You still think — ” 

“I think you had better remain in 
contact with Benedict the entire 
time he is up there, that is what I 
think. If Brand gets the upper hand, 
you may need to pull Benedict back 
immediately to save his life.” 

“Of course. But then — ” 

“But then we would have lost a 
round. Admitted. But not the game. 
Even with the Jewel fully attuned, 
he would have to get to the primal 
Pattern to do his real damage with 
it — and you have that under 
guard.” 

“Yes,” I said. “You seem to 
have everything figured. You sur- 
prised me, moving so fast.” 

“I’ve had a lot of time on my 
hands recently, which can be a bad 
thing unless you use it for thinking. 
So I did. What I think now is that 



GALAXY 




you had best move fast. The day 
isn’t getting any longer.” 

“Agreed,” I said. “Thanks for 
the good counsel.” 

“Save your thanks till we see 
what comes of it,” he said, and 
then he broke the contact. 

“That one sounded important,” 
Random said. “What’s up?” 

“Appropriate question,” I an- 
swered, “but I am all out of time 
now. You will have to wait till 
morning for the story.” 

“Is there anything I can do to 
help?” 

“As a matter of fact,” I said, 
“yes, if you’ll either ride double or 
go back to Amber on a Trump. I 
need Star.” 

“Sure,” Random said. “No 
trouble. Is that all?” 

“Yes. Haste is all.” 

We moved toward the horses. 

1 patted Star a few times and then 
mounted. 

“We'll see you in Amber,” Ran- 
dom said. “Good luck.” 

“In Amber,” I said. “Thanks.” 

I turned and headed toward the 
place of the stairway, treading my 
tomb’s lengthening shadow east- 
ward. 



XIII. 

On the highest ridge of Kolvir 
there is a formation which resem- 
bles three steps. I sat on the lowest 
of these and waited for more to 
occur above me. It takes night and 
moonlight to do this, so half of the 
requirements had been met. 

There were clouds to the west 
and northeast. I was leary of those 
clouds. If they massed sufficiently

*************** 



to block all moonlight, Tir-na 
Nog’th faded back to nothingness. 
This was one reason why it was al- 
ways advisable to have a backup 
man on the ground, to trump you to 
safety should the city vanish about 
you. 

The sky overhead was clear, 
however, and filled with familiar 
stars. When the moon came up and 
its light fell upon the stone on which 
I rested, the stairway in the sky 
would come into being, sweeping 
upward to a great height, taking its 
way to Tir-na Nog’th, the image of 
Amber that rode the night’s middle 
air. 

I was weary. Too much had oc- 
curred in too brief a time. Suddenly 
to be at rest, to remove my boots 
and rub my feet, to lean back and 
rest my head, even against stone, 
was a luxury, a pure animal plea- 



97 



sure. I drew my cloak together be- 
fore me against the growing chill. A 
hot bath, a full meal, a bed would 
be very good things. But these as- 
sumed an almost mythic quality 
from that vantage. It was more than 
sufficient simply to rest as I was, to 
let my thoughts move more slowly, 
drifting, spectator-like, back over 
the day’s happenings. 

So much. But now, at least, I 
had some answers to some of my 
questions. Not all of them, cer- 
tainly. But enough to slake my 
mind’s thirst for the moment. I 
now had some idea as to what had 
been going on during my absence, a 
better understanding of what was 
happening now, a knowledge of 
some of the things that had to be 
done, of what / had to do. And I 
felt, somehow, that I knew more 
than I realized, consciously, that I 
already possessed pieces that would 
fit the growing picture before me, if 
I were only to jiggle them, flip 
them, rotate them properly. The 
pace of recent events, particularly 
today’s, had not allowed me a mo- 
ment’s reflection. Now, though, 
some of the pieces seemed to be 
turning at odd angles. 

I was distracted by a stirring 
above my shoulder, a tiny effect of 
brightening in the higher air. Turn- 
ing, then standing, I regarded the 
horizon. A preliminary glow had 
occurred out over the sea at the 
point where the moon would as- 
cend. As I watched, a minute arc of 
light came into view. The clouds 
had shifted slightly, also, though 
not enough to cause concern. I 
glanced up then, but the overhead 
phenomenon had not yet begun. I 
withdrew my Trumps, however, rif- 

98 



fled them and cut out Benedict’s. 

Lethargy forgotten, I stared, 
watching the moon expand above 
the water, casting a trail of light 
over the waves. A faint form was 
suddenly hovering on the threshold 
of visibility high overhead. As the 
light grew, a spark limned it here 
and there. The first lines, faint as 
spiderwebbing, appeared above the 
rock. I studied Benedict’s card, I 
reached for contact. 

His cold image came alive. I saw 
him in the chamber of the Pattern, 
standing at the design’s center. A 
lighted lantern glowed beside his 
left foot. He became aware of my 
presence. 

“Corwin,” he said, “is it time?” 

“Not quite,” I told him. “The 
moon is rising. The city is just be- 
ginning to take form. So it will only 
be a little longer. I wanted to be 
certain you were ready.” 

“I am ready,” he said. 

“It is good that you came back 
when you did. Did you learn any- 
thing of interest?” 

“Ganelon called me back,” he 
said, “as soon as he learned what 
had happened. His plan seemed a 
good one, which is why I am here. 
As for the Courts of Chaos, yes. I 
believe I have learned a few 
things — ” 

“A moment,” I said. 

The moonbeam strands had as- 
sumed a more tangible appearance. 
The city overhead was now clear in 
outline. The stairway was visible in 
its entirety, though fainter in some 
places than in others. I stretched 
forth my hand, above the second 
stair, the third. 

Cool, soft, I encountered the 
fourth stair. It seemed to give 



GALAXY 




somewhat beneath my push, how- 
ever. 

“Almost,” I said to Benedict. “I 
am going to try the stair. Be 
ready.” 

He nodded. 

I mounted the stone stairs, one, 
two, three. I raised my foot then 
and lowered it upon the fourth, 
ghostly one. It yielded gently to my 
weight. I was afraid to raise my 
other foot, so I waited, watching 
the moon. I breathed the cool air as 
the brightness increased, as the path 
in the waters widened. Glancing 
upward, 1 saw Tir-na Nog’th lose 
something of its transparency. The 
stars behind it grew dimmer. As 
this occurred, the stair became 
firmer beneath my foot. All resil- 
iency went out of it. I felt that it 
might bear my full weight. Casting 
my eyes along its length, I now saw 
it in its entirety, here translucent, 
there transparent, sparkling, but 
continuous all the way up to the si- 
lent city that drifted above the sea. I 
raised my other foot and stood on 
the fourth stair. If I’d the mind, a 
few more steps would send me 
along that celestial escalator into the 
place of dreams made real, walking 
neuroses and dubious prophecy, into 
a moonlit city of ambiguous wish- 
fulfillment, twisted time and pallid 
beauty. I stepped back down and 
glanced at the moon, now balanced 
on the world’s wet rim. I regarded 
Benedict’s Trump in its silvery 
glow. 

“The stair is solid, the moon is 
up,” I said. 

“All right. I am going.” 

I watched him there at the center 
of the Pattern. He raised the lantern 
in his left hand and for a moment 



stood unmoving. An instant later he 
was gone, and so was the Pattern. 
Another instant, and he stood within 
a similar chamber, this time outside 
the Pattern, next to the point where 
it begins. He raised the lantern high 
and looked all around the room. He 
was alone. 

He turned, walked to the wall, 
moved along it, set the lantern 
there. His shadow stretched toward 
the Pattern, changed shape as he 
turned on his heel, moved back to 
his first position. 

This Pattern, I noted, glowed 
with a paler light than the one in 
Amber — silvery white, without the 
hint of blue with which I was famil- 
iar. Its configuration was the same, 
but the ghost city played strange 
tricks with perspective. There were 
distortions — narrowings, widen- 
ings — which seemed to shift for no 
particular reason across its surface, 
as though I viewed the entire tab- 
leau through an irregular lens rather 
than Benedict’s Trump. 

I retreated down the stair, settled 
once again on the lowest step. I 
continued to observe. 

Benedict loosened his blade in its 
scabbard. 

“You know about the possible 
effect of blood on the Pattern?” I 
asked. 

“Yes. Ganelon told me.” 

“Did you ever suspect — any of 
this?” 

“I never trusted Brand,” he told 
me. 

“What of your journey to the 
Courts of Chaos? What did you 
learn?” 

“Later, Corwin. He could come 
any time now.” 

“I hope no distracting visions 

99 



THE HAND OF OBERON 




show up,” I said, recalling my own 
journey to Tir-na Nog’th and his 
own part in my final adventure 
there. 

He shrugged. 

“One gives them power by pay- 
ing them heed. My attention is re- 
served for one matter tonight.” 

He turned through a full circle, 
regarding every part of the 
chamber, halted when he had 
finished. 

“I wonder if he knows you are 
there?” I said. 

“Perhaps. It does not matter.” 

I nodded. If Brand did not show 
up, we had gained a day. The 
guards would ward the other Pat- 
terns, Fiona would have a chance to 
demonstrate her own skill in matters 
arcane by locating Brand for us. We 
would then pursue him. She and 
Bleys had been able to stop him 
once before. Could she do it alone 
now? Or would we have to find 
Bleys and try to convince him to 
help? Had Brand found Bleys? 
What the hell did Brand want that 
kind of power for anyhow? A desire 
for the throne I could understand. 
Yet. The man was mad, I leave 
it at that. Too bad, but that’s the 
way it was. Heredity or environ- 
ment? I wondered wryly. We were 
all of us, to some degree, mad after 
his fashion. To be honest, it had to 
be a form of madness, to have so 
much and to strive so bitterly for 
just a little more, for a bit of an 
edge over the others. He carried this 
tendency to its extreme, that is all. 
He was a caricature of this mania in 
all of us. In this sense, did it really 
matter which of us was the traitor? 

Yes, it did. He was the one who 
had acted. Mad or not, he had gone 

100 



too far. He had done things Eric, 
Julian and I would not have done. 
Bleys and Fiona had finally backed 
away from his thickening plot. 
Gerard and Benedict were a notch 
above the rest of us — moral, ma- 
ture, whatever— for they had 
exempted themselves from the 
zero-sum power game. Random had 
changed, quite a bit, in recent 
years. Could it be that the children 
of the unicorn took ages in which to 
mature, that it was slowly happen- 
ing to the rest of us but had some- 
how passed Brand by? Or could it 
be that by his actions Brand was 
causing it in the rest of us? Like 
most such questions, the benefit of 
these was in the asking, not the an- 
swering. We were enough like 
Brand that I knew a particular 
species of fear nothing else could so 
provoke. But yes, it did matter. 
Whatever the reason, he was the 
one who had acted. 

The moon was higher now, its 
vision superimposed upon my in- 
ward viewing of the chamber of the 
Pattern. The clouds continued to 
shift, to boil nearer the moon. I 
thought of advising Benedict, but it 
would serve no other end than dis- 
traction. Above me, Tir-na Nog’th 
rode like some supernatural ark 
upon the seas of night. 

And suddenly Brand was there. 

Reflexively, my hand went to 
Grayswandir’s hilt, despite the fact 
that a part of me realized from the 
very first that he stood across the 
Pattern from Benedict in a dark 
chamber high in the sky. 

My hand fell again. Benedict had 
become aware of the intruding pre- 
sence immediately, and he turned to 
face him. He made no move toward 



GALAXY 




his weapon, but simply stared 
across the Pattern at our brother. 

My earliest fear had been that 
Brand would contrive to arrive di- 
rectly behind Benedict and stab him 
in the back. I would not have tried 
that though, because even in death 
Benedict’s reflexes might have been 
sufficient to dispatch his assailant. 
Apparently, Brand wasn’t that crazy 
either. 

Brand smiled. 

“Benedict,” he said. “Fancy. 
You. Here.” 

The Jewel of Judgment hung 
fiery upon his breast. 

“Brand,” Benedict said, “don’t 
try it.” 

Still smiling, Brand unclasped his 
swordbelt and let his weapon fall to 
the floor. When the echoes died, he 
said, “I am not a fool, Benedict. 
The man hasn’t been born who can 
go up against you with a blade.” 

“I don’t need the blade, Brand.” 

Brand began walking, slowly, 
about the edge of the Pattern. 

“Yet you wear it as a servant of 
the throne, when you could have 
been king.” 

“That has never been high on my 
list of ambitions.” 

“That is right.” He paused, only 
partway about the Pattern. “Loyal, 
self-effacing. You have not changed 
at all. Pity Dad conditioned you so 
well. You could have gone so much 
further.” 

“I have everything that I want,” 
Benedict said. 

“. .To have been stifled, cut 
off, so early.” 

“You cannot talk your way past 
me either. Brand. Do not make me 
hurt you.” 

The smile still on his face. Brand 
THE HAND OF OBERON 



began moving again, slowly. What 
was it he was trying to do? 1 could 
not figure his strategy. 

“You know I can do certain 
things the others cannot,” Brand 
said. “If there is anything at all that 
you want and think that you cannot 
have, now is your chance to name it 
and learn how wrong you were. I 
have learned things you would 
scarcely believe.” 

Benedict smiled one of his rare 
smiles. 

“You have chosen the wrong 
line,” he said. “I can walk to any- 
thing that I want.” 

“Shadows!” Brand snorted, halt- 
ing again. “Any of the others can 
clutch a phantom! I am talking of 
reality! Amber! Power! Chaos! Not 
daydreams made solid! Not 
second-best!” 

“If I had wanted more than I 
have, I knew what to do. I did not 
do it.” 

Brand laughed, began walking 
again. He had come a quarter of the 
way about the Pattern’s periphery. 
The Jewel burned more brightly. 
His voice rang. 

“You are a fool, to wear your 
chains willingly! But if things do 
not call out to you to possess them 
and if power holds no attraction, 
what of knowledge? I learned the 
last of Dworkin’s lore. I have gone 
on since then and paid dark prices 
for greater insight into the workings 
of the universe. This you could 
have without that pricetag.” 

“There would be a price,” Ben- 
edict said, “one that I will not 
pay.” 

Brand shook his head and tossed 
his hair. The image of the Pattern 
wavered for a moment then, as a 



101 




wisp of cloud crossed the moon. 
Tir-na Nog’th faded slightly, re- 
turned to normal focus. 

“You mean it, you really mean 
it,’’ Brand said, apparently not 
aware of the moment of fading. “I 
shan’t test you further then. I had to 
try.” He halted again, staring. 
“You are too good a man to waste 
yourself on that mess in Amber, de- 
fending something that is obviously 
falling apart. I am going to win, 
Benedict. I am going to erase 
Amber and build it anew. 1 am 
going to rub out the old Pattern and 
draw my own. You can be with me. 
I want you on my side. I am going 
to raise up a perfect world, one 
with more direct access to and from 
Shadow. I am going to merge 
Amber with the Courts of Chaos. I 
am going to extend this realm di- 
rectly through all of Shadow. You 
will command our legions, the 
mightiest military forces ever as- 
sembled. You — ” 

“If your new world would be as 
perfect as you say, Brand, there 
would be no need for legions. If, on 
the other hand, it is to reflect the 
mind of its creator, then 1 see it as 
something less than an improvement 
over the present state of affairs. 
Thank you for your offer, but I hold 
with the Amber which already ex- 
ists.” 

“You are a fool, Benedict. A 
well-meaning one, but a fool 
nevertheless.” 

He began to move again, casu- 
ally. He was within forty feet of 
Benedict. Thirty. He kept mov- 
ing. He finally paused about twenty 
feet away, hooked his thumbs be- 
hind his belt and simply stared. Ben- 
edict met his gaze. I checked the 

102 



clouds again. A long mass of them 
continued a moonward slide. I 
could pull Benedict out at any time, 
though. It was hardly worth disturb- 
ing him at the moment. 

“Why don’t you come and cut 
me down then?” Brand finally said. 
“Unarmed as I am, it should not be 
difficult. The fact that the same 
blood flows in both our veins makes 
no difference, does it? What are 
you waiting for?” 

“I already told you that I do not 
wish to hurt you,” Benedict said. 

“Yet you stand ready to, if I at- 
tempt to pass your way.” 

Benedict simply nodded. 

“Admit that you fear me, Ben- 
edict. All of you are afraid of me. 
Even when I approach you 
weaponless like this, something 
must be twisting in your guts. You 
see my confidence and you do not 
understand it. You must be afraid.” 
Benedict did not reply. 

“. .And you fear my blood on 
your hands,” Brand went on, “you 
fear my death-curse.” 

“Did you fear Martin’s blood on 
your own?” Benedict asked. 

“That bastard puppy!” Brand 
said. “He was not truly one of us. 
He was only a tool.” 

“Brand, I have no desire to kill a 
brother. Give me that trinket you 
wear about your neck and come 
back with me now to Amber. It is 
not too late to set matters right.” 
Brand threw back his head and 
laughed. 

“Oh, nobly spoken! Nobly spo- 
ken, Benedict! Like a true Lord of 
the realm! You would shame me 
with your excessive virtue! And 
what is the sticking point of this 
all?” He reached down and stroked 



GALAXY 




the Jewel of Judgment. “This?” He 
laughed again and strode forward. 
“This bauble? Would its surrender 
buy us peace, amity, order? Would 
it ransom my life?” 

He halted once more, ten feet 
from Benedict now. He raised the 
Jewel between his fingers and 
looked down at it. 

“Do you realize the full powers 
of this thing?” he asked. 

“Enough of th — ” Benedict be- 
gan, and his voice cracked in his 
throat. 

Brand hurriedly took another step 
forward. The Jewel was bright be- 
fore him. Benedict’s hand had 
begun to move toward his blade, 
but it did not reach it. He stood 
stiffly now, as if suddenly trans- 
formed into a statue. Then I began 
to understand, but by then it was 
too late. 

Nothing that Brand had been say- 
ing had really mattered. It had sim- 
ply been a running line of patter, a 
distraction thrown up before him 
while he sought cautiously after the 
proper range. He was indeed partly 
attuned to the Jewel, and the limited 
control this gave him was still suffi- 
cient to enable him to produce ef- 
fects with it, effects which I was 
unaware it could produce, but of 
which he had known all along. 
Brand had carefully contrived his 
arrival a good distance from Ben- 
edict, tried the Jewel, moved a lit- 
tle nearer, tried again, kept up this 
movement, this testing, until he 
found the point where it could ef- 
fect Benedict’s nervous system. 

“Benedict,” I said, “you had bet- 
ter come to me now,” and I 
exerted my will, but he did not 
budge nor did he reply. His Trump 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



was still functioning, I felt his pre- 
sence, I observed events because of 
it, but I could not reach him. The 
Jewel was obviously affecting more 
than his motor system. 

I looked to the clouds again. 
They were still growing, they were 
reaching for the moon. It seemed 
they might come across it soon. If I 
could not pull Benedict out when it 
happened, he would fall to the sea as 
soon as the light was fully blocked, 
the city disrupted. Brand! If he be- 
came aware of it, he might be able 
to use the Jewel to dissipate the 
clouds. 

But to do that, he would probably 
have to release Benedict. I did not 
think he would do it. Still. The 
clouds seemed to be slowing now. 
This entire line of reasoning could 
become unnecessary. I thumbed out 
Brand’s Trump though, and set it 
aside. 

“Benedict, Benedict,” said 
Brand, smiling, “of what use is the 
finest swordsman alive if he cannot 
move to take up his blade? I told 
you that you were a fool. Did you 
think I would walk willingly to my 
slaughter? You should have trusted 
the fear you must have felt. You 
should have known that I would not 
enter this place helpless. I meant it 
when I said that I was going to win. 
You were a good choice though, 
because you are the best. I really 
wish that you had accepted my of- 
fer. But it is not that important 
now. I cannot be stopped. None of 
the others has a chance, and with 
you gone things are going to be 
much easier.” 

He reached beneath his cloak and 
produced a dagger. 

“Bring me through, Benedict!” I 

103 




cried, but it was no use. There was 
no response, nothing strong enough 
to trump me up there. 

I seized Brand’s Trump. I re- 
called my Trump battle with Eric. If 
I could hit Brand through his 
Trump, I might be able to break his 
concentration sufficiently for Ben- 
edict to come free. I turned all of 
my faculties upon the card, prepar- 
ing for a massive mental assault. 

But nothing. The way was frozen 
and dark. 

It had to be that his concentration 
on the task at hand, his mental in- 
volvement with the Jewel, was so 
complete that I simply could not 
reach him. I was blocked at every 
turn. 

Suddenly, the stairway grew paler 
above me and I cast a quick glance 
at the moon. A limb of cumulus 
now covered a portion of its face. 
Damn! 

I returned my attention to Ben- 
edict’s Trump. It seemed slow, but 
I did recover the contact, indicating 
that somewhere, inside it all, Ben- 
edict was still conscious. Brand 
had moved a pace nearer and was 
still taunting him. The Jewel on its 
heavy chain burned with the light of 
its use. They stood perhaps three 
paces apart now. Brand toyed with 
the dagger. 

“. .Yes, Benedict,” he was 
saying, “you probably would have 
preferred to die in battle. On the 
other hand, you might look upon 
this as a kind of honor — a signal 
honor. In a way, your death will 
allow the birth of a new order. .” 

For a moment, the Pattern faded 
behind them. I could not tear my 
eyes from the scene to examine the 
moon, however. There, within the 



shadows and the flickering light, his 
back to the Pattern, Brand did not 
seem to notice. He took another 
step forward. 

“But enough of this,” he said. 
“There are things to be done, and 
the night grows no younger.” 

He stepped nearer and lowered 
the blade. 

“Good night, sweet Prince,” he 
said, and he moved to close with 
him. 

At that instant, Benedict’s strange 
mechanical right arm, torn from this 
place of shadow and silver and 
moonlight, moved with the speed of 
a striking snake. Thing of glinting, 
metallic planes like the facets of a 
gem, wrist and elbow wondrous 
weaves of silver cable, pinned with 
flecks of fire, stylized, skeletal, a 
Swiss toy, a mechanical insect, 
functional, deadly, beautiful in its 
way, it shot forward with a speed 
that I could not follow, while the 
rest of his body remained steady, a 
statue. 

The mechanical fingers caught 
the Jewel’s chain about Brand’s 
neck. Immediately, the arm moved 
upward, raising Brand high above 
the floor. Brand dropped the dagger 
and clutched at his throat with both 
hands. 

Behind him, the Pattern faded 
once again. It returned with a much 
paler glow. Brand’s face in the lan- 
tern light was a ghastly, twisted ap- 
parition. Benedict remained frozen, 
holding him on high, unmoving, a 
human gallows. 

The Pattern grew dimmer. Above 
me, the steps began to recede. The 
moon was half-occluded. 

Writhing, Brand raised his arms 
above his head, catching at the 



104 



GALAXY 




chain on either side of the metal 
hand that held it. He was strong, as 
all of us are. I saw his muscles 
bunch and harden. By then, his face 
was dark and his neck a mass of 
straining cables. He bit his lip; the 
blood ran into his beard as he drew 
upon the chain. 

With a sharp snap followed by a 
rattling, the chain parted and Brand 
fell to the floor gasping. He rolled 
over once, clutching at his throat 
with both hands. 

Slowly, very slowly, Benedict 
lowered his strange arm. He still 
held the chain and the Jewel. He 
flexed his other arm. He sighed 
deeply. 

The Pattern grew even dimmer. 
Above me, Tir-na Nog’th becatpe 
transparent. The moon was almost 
gone. 

“Benedict!” I cried. “Can you 
hear me?” 

“Yes,” he said, very softly, and 
he began to sink through the floor. 

“The city is fading! You’ve got 
to come to me right away!” 

I extended my hand. 

“Brand. .” he said, turning. 

But Brand was sinking also, and 
I saw that Benedict could not reach 
him. I clasped Benedict’s left hand 
and jerked. Both of us fell to the 
ground beside the high outcrop. 

I helped him to his feet. Then we 
both seated ourselves on the stone. 
For a long while, we did not say 
anything. I looked again and Tir-na 
Nog’th was gone. 

1 thought back over everything 
that had happened, so fast, so sud- 
den, that day. A great weight of 
weariness lay upon me now, and 1 
felt that my energies must be at 
their end, that shortly I must sleep. 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



I could scarcely think straight. Life 
had simply been too crowded re- 
cently. I leaned my head back 
against the stone once more, regard- 
ing cloud and star. 

The pieces. The pieces which 
it seemed should fit, if only the 
proper jiggle, twist or flip were 
applied. ... They were jiggling, 
twisting and flipping now, almost of 
their own accord. 

“Is he dead, do you think?’’ Ben- 
edict asked, pulling me back from 
a half-dream of emerging forms. 

“Probably,” 1 said. “He was in 
bad shape when things fell apart. 

“It was a long way down. He 
might have had time to work some 
escape along the lines of his ar- 
rival.” 

“Right now it does not really 
matter,” I said. “You’ve drawn his 
fangs.” 

Benedict grunted. He was still 
holding the Jewel, a much dimmer 
red than it had been so recently. 

“True,” he finally said. “The 
Pattern is safe now. I wish. I 
wish that some time, long ago, 
something had not been said that 
was said, or something done that 
was not done. Something, had we 
known, which might have let him 
grow differently, something which 
would have seen him become 
another man than the bitter, bent 
thing I saw up there. It is best now 
if he is dead. But it is a waste of 
something that might have been.” 

I did not answer him. What he 
had said might or might not be 
right. It did not matter. Brand might 
have been borderline psychotic, 
whatever that means, and then again 
maybe not. There is always a rea- 
son. Whenever anything has been 

106 



mucked up, whenever anything out- 
rageous happens there is a reason 
for it. You still have a mucked-up, 
outrageous situation on your hands, 
however, and explaining it does not 
alleviate it one bit. If someone does 
something really rotten, there is a 
reason for it. Learn it, if you care, 
and you learn why he is a son of a 
bitch. The fact is the thing that re- 
mains, though. Brand had acted. It 
changed nothing to run a posthu- 
mous psychoanalysis. Acts and their 
consequences are the things by 
which our fellows judge us. Any- 
thing else, and all that you get is a 
cheap feeling of moral superiority 
by thinking how you would have 
done something nicer if it had been 
you. 

So as for the rest, leave it to 
heaven. I’m not qualified. 

“We had best get back to 
Amber,” Benedict said. “There are 
a great number of things that must 
be done.” 

“Wait,” I said. 

“Why?” 

“I’ve been thinking.” 

When I did not elaborate, he fi- 
nally said, “And. .?” 

I riffled slowly through my 
Trumps, replacing his, replacing 
Brand’s. 

“Haven’t you wondered yet 
about the new arm you wear?” I 
asked him. 

“Of course. You brought it from 
Tir-na Nog’th, under unusual cir- 
cumstances. It fits. It works. It pro- 
ved itself tonight.” 

“Exactly. Isn’t the last a lot of 
weight to dump on poor coinci- 
dence? The one weapon that gave 
you a chance up there, against the 
Jewel. And it just happened to be a 

GALAXY 




part of you — and you just happened 
to be the person who was up there, 
to use it? Trace things back and 
trace them forward again. Isn’t 
there an extraordinary — no, pre- 
posterous — chain of coincidences 
involved?” 

“When you put it that way. .” 
he said. 

‘‘I do. And you must realize as 
well as I do that there has to be 
more to it than that.” 

“All right. Say that. But how? 
How was it done?” 

“I have no idea,” 1 said, with- 
drawing the card I had not looked 
upon in a long, long while, feeling 
its coldness beneath my fingertips, 
“but the method is not important. 
You asked the wrong question.” 
“What should I have asked?” 
“Not ‘How?’ but ‘Who?’ ” 

“You think that a human agency 
arranged that entire chain of events, 
up through the recovery of the 
Jewel?” 

“I don’t know about that. What’s 
human? But I do think that someone 
we both know has returned and is 
behind it all.” 

“All right. Who?” 

I showed him the Trump that I 
held. 

“Dad? That is ridiculous! He 
must be dead. It’s been so long.” 
“You know he could have en- 
gineered it. He’s that devious. We 
never understood all of his pow- 
ers.” 

Benedict rose to his feet. He 
stretched. He shook his head. 

“I think you have been out in the 
cold too long, Corwin. Let’s go 
home now.” 

“Without testing my guess? 
Come on! That is hardly sporting. 



Sit down and give me a minute. 
Let’s try his Trump.” 

“He would have contacted some- 
one by now.” 

“I don’t think so. In fact — 
Come on. Humor me. What have we 
got to lose?” 

“All right. Why not?” 

He sat down beside me. I held 
the Trump where both of us could 
make it out. We stared at it. I re- 
laxed my mind, I reached for con- 
tact. It came almost immediately. 

He was smiling as he regarded 
us. 

“Good evening. That was a fine 
piece of work,” Ganelon said. “I 
am pleased that you brought back 
my trinket. I’ll be needing it 
soon.” ★

FIey, you folks are beautiful! 

Back in the Feb. ’76 Bookshelf, I 
asked for some feedback from you, 
the reader, and gave my mailing 
address. My friends warned me that 
it might go off in my face, but I 
wanted to get some better idea of 
who I was writing for (who are all 
you zombies out there?). Jim Baen 
keeps telling me I’m terrific, but 
then what does he know? I expected 



108 



GALAXY 




anywhere from Plenty o’ Nuttin’ to 
a dozen or so crayoned threats on 
my life, and what did I get? 

An average of seven letters a day 
lor the past three weeks now — so 
many that Baen is even now gnash- 
ing his teeth and wondering when 
the hell this column is going to ar- 
rive. Virtually all of them are coher- 
ent. The vast majority of them are 
thoughtful. Many are incisive. All 
save one are polite. And fully ten 
percent of them are legible. 

Seriously, thanks a lot. I got just 
what I was looking for, and then 
some. I was pleasantly astounded to 
learn how many of you really do 
care, passionately about the sf you 
read (who the hell keeps buying all 
those turkeys, then?), and gratified 
by all the comments on this column 
of mine. Apparently I’m satisfying 
you people, which is my heartfelt 
aim. I wish it were physically pos- 
sible to send a personal reply to 
each and every one of you, but 
since it isn’t, please assume that I 
mean you when I say, from the bot- 
tom of my heart, “The same to 
you, buddy.” 

Now back to work. 

* * * 

I have some doubts about the ad- 
visability of devoting a full half a 
column to only three books — but it 
seems to me that they loom large 
enough on the sf horizon to consti- 
tute an Event. 

According to Berkley, Children 



of Dune is the conclusion of a tril- 
ogy, the last book in the enormous 
Dune cycle. So I got out my copies 
of Dune and Dune Messiah and 
read the whole damn thing in se- 
quence (Notes From The Bookstore 
Rides Again). For the past two 
weeks I’ve been so immersed in Ar- 
rakis (no, wait — that’s a mixed 
metaphor. .) so saturated with 
Fremen lore (nope, dammit — that’s 
another) I say. I’ve been so in- 
volved with Muad’Dib & Co. that 
my nose itches where the stillsuit 
binds and the whites of my eyes are 
turning blue. You might say 
I’m. .er. .Dune buggy. 

Dune itself is one of the most 
discussed books of our genre, 
clearly a classic work. It was a 
magnificently ambitious undertak- 
ing, an attempt to mate mystical 
theology with the hardest of hard 
science fiction, and it worked well 
enough to satisfy virtually everyone. 
Re-reading it was an extremely 
pleasant experience: I found it to be 
even better than I remembered it 
(the book hadn’t grown: I had). 

There were, of course, minor 
flaws. Things I stubbed my toe on 
included the Evil Baron, so 
stereotyped he might more properly 
be called a monotype; and the 
ridiculous ease with which he cor- 
rupted Yueh. It’s just not plausible 
to have a “foolproof conditioned 
loyalty,” so good it’s never for a 
second doubted by the most sus- 
picious Mentat in the known uni- 
verse, fall to pieces under the most 



BOOKSHELF 



109 




obvious counter imaginable (the old 
“You haff relatifs on Giedi 
Prime?” ploy). 

But minor beefs got swept away 
by the sheer brilliance of the writ- 
ing, the astonishing depth of 
background and characterization, 
the incredible scope of Herbert’s 
imaginative vision. Dune is a tapes- 
try so vast and intricately worked 
that you excuse the fact that the 
third unicorn from the left has five 
legs. Any of you chuckleheads 
who’ve failed to buy it thus far are 
enjoined to do so at once. Of the 
two editions currently on the stands, 
I reluctantly recommend the Ace: its 
cover painting is grossly inferior to 
that of the Berkley edition, but 
there seem to be fewer typos — and 
there are still a few of the original- 
print-run Aces around, which are 
450 cheaper. On the other hand, if 
you get the Berkley, you can get 
Dune Messiah and Children of 
Dune with coordinated covers. It’s 
your dough. 

So then I read Dune Messiah 
again, with Dime fresh in my mind, 
and by golly, it was better than I 
remembered it too. The sheer inven- 
tiveness: Guildsmen swimming in 
tanks of orange gas, Bijaz the mad 
dwarf, the Face Dancer assassin 
(whose code requires that his vic- 
tims always have a fair chance to 
escape), Hayt the ghola with his 
ball-bearing eyes. .like a Christ- 
mas tree hung with egg-size opals. 
In fact, that’s the trouble. 

Because those lovely opals dis- 

110 



guise a rather sparse tree — at least by \ 
comparison with Dune. The whole 
book revolves around an intricate 
and subtle conspiracy against 
Muad’Dib, involving the Spacer’s 
Guild, the mysterious Tleilaxu, and 
the good old Bene Gesserit. Yet, in 
its very intricacy and subtlety, the 
plot becomes so convoluted and ( 
Byzantine that I fail to understand 
what any of the plotters stood to 
gain. The blinding of Muad’Dib? 
With a planet-wrecking atomic de- 
vice, for God’s sake? Moe of the 
Three Stooges could have handled 
the job more efficiently. The seduc- 
tion of Muad’Dib with the promise 
of resurrection of his dead wife? 
Fine; but basing a whole conspiracy 
on the death of one woman in 
childbirth requires either blind faith 
in luck, or else the very prescience 
which Herbert says cannot be 
applied to another prescient or his 
companions. For awhile I thought 
the idea was for the ghola to assas- 
sinate Muad’Dib, but that turned 
out to be a feint. On the other hand, 
it might have worked — and if it 
had, the real plot would have 
failed. 

Enough. This is getting as com- 
plex as the conspiracy itself — and 
perhaps as pointless. I still did 
enjoy the book a lot, even as I was 
driving a truck through the holes in 
its logic, because it had the same 
majestic rolling grandeur of the pre- 
vious book, steam-rollering object 
tions as they arose. 

And so I came, with tired eyes 

GALAXY 




and a thirst you wouldn’t believe, to 
Children of Dune. Bear in mind 
throughout the following that I’m 
basing it all on the version 
serialized in Analog — the eventual 
Berkley hardcover (which should be 
out by the time you read this) may 
just contain changes invalidating 
some of my remarks (whaddya 
gonna do?). 

Okay. To start with, I found CoD 
about three times as dramatically 
compelling as DM, about twice as 
much as D itself (my fingers are 
tired). In the better-than-ten years 
since the first book was written, 
Herbert has polished the technique 
of cliff-hanger flash-cuts (leaving 
each character just as you’re des- 
perate to find out what happens next, 
except that you’re equally desperate 
to see what has happened to the 
character he’s returning to now) to 
something near perfection, sustain- 
ing a dramatic tension that kept me 
chained to my mailbox (right in the 
teeth of the wind whipping in off 
the Bay of Fundy, mind you) wait- 
ing for the next installment to ar- 
rive. John Brunner is the only 
writer I can think of who does the 
C-H F-C technique as deftly. 

Furthermore, there are some ab- 
solutely delightful surprises, star- 
tling twists so ingenious as to dilate 
the pupils. I wouldn’t spoil any of 
’em for the world, and if some 
wiseacre comes up to you with an 
evil grin and says, “Hey, you know 
what happens in Children of 
Dune ?” I suggest you wedge a 



softball against his soft palate — but 
take my word for it, you’ll never 
guess in a million years, even 
though the first two books give you 
all the hints you need. 

On top of all this, there’s a satis- 
fying cast: the Lady Jessica, who 
waited patiently offstage throughout 
DM, returns front and center, as 
does Gurney Halleck. There’s Dun- 
can Idaho, good old Stilgar, the 
ever-youthful Irulan, the Bene Ges- 
serit, and, of course, the C of D, 
Leto II and Ghanima (two of the 
strangest characters even sf has to 
offer) — more than enough to com- 
pensate for Arrakis’s unfortunate 
propensity for using up characters 
(lessee now: Leto I, Yueh, Liet- 
Kynes, Hawat, Duncan I, Piter, The 
Baron, Chani, Muad’Dib, Scytale, 
Bijaz, Gaius Helen Mohiam, several 
shitloads of Sardaukar. .puff 
puff. .and wait’ll you see who 
gets croaked in this book). 

So with all this, why did I finish 
the book unsatisfied? 

Minor gripes first. The intricate 
conspiracies and counterplots which 
began to get out of hand in DM 
reach a point perilously close to ab- 
surdity here (maybe Herbert just 
plain likes treachery and intrigue). I 
read page after page of delicate ver- 
bal fencing, with at least triple- 
meanings, of which I understood 
not a word until and unless Herbert 
told me, in Auctorial Voice, what 
had just transpired. Worse, he threw 
in an impossibly subtle conversation 
carried on in sign language (the old 



BOOKSHELF 



111 




“Atreides hand signals,” but here 
given such an enormous implied 
vocabulary, grammar and syntax as 
to give an accomplished hula artist 
apoplexy) between Gurney and Jes- 
sica. This conversation is held in 
sign-language to foil the spy- 
cameras of Alia — who knows the 
sign-language. (Herbert says, “The 
Atreides had used this means of 
communication for centuries without 
anyone being the wiser.” But Alia 
has available to her the total mem- 
ory of every one of those Atreides 
forebears.) 

Other minor beefs: oh the hell 
with it, this is going on too long. 
Stop picking nits, Spider. 

Well the trouble is, the one thing 
that nearly spoiled the book for me, 
the Main Pain, was the ending. And 
if I give it away you’re liable to 
stuff a softball in my mouth. 

I know, I know. It’s not fair to 
knock a book without telling you 
why — but I can’t. What value the 
ending does have arises from its 
unexpectedness — in fact, I defy you 
to guess it ahead of time (that’s one 
big objection — it wasn’t planted at 
all, just pulled out of a hat in the 
last act). By me it was a wet fire- 
cracker, but you may think it's the 
dromedary’s drawers. 

Maybe I can tell you how I felt 
about the ending, without giving 
anything away. My first response, 
after I put the last installment in my 
“Finished For Review” file (my of- 
fice floor) was, “After four 
thousand years of selective breeding 



we get a midget covered' with Crazy 
Glue?” 

But that’s a purely materialistic 
response to the physical, science- 
fiction plot side of the ending. My 
discontent ran deeper. So I talked it 
over with beloved Jeanne (she too

who tends to see the spiritual side 
of things clearer than I do, and she 
said her first response was, “After 
a quarter of a million words of 
philosophical searching, you tell me 
yin-yang?” 

Neither of those glib epigrams is 
liable to mean a lot to you if you 
haven’t read CoD, but it’s the best I 
can do without, in effect, murdering 
the ending in order to demonstrate 
that the ending is dead. Almost 
makes me wish I was a critic, in- 
stead of a reviewer (your Adviser in 
the spending of your sf dollar) — 
then I’d be allowed (even e pected) 
to approach a book the way an au- 
topsy team approaches a body. 
You’ll have to take my word for it 
that the Muad’Dib / remember 
would, if his limited prescience had 
shown him this future, have com- 
mitted suicide significantly earlier 
than he did. 

Tell you what: why don’t you 
stagger out and score a copy of the 
book, read it, and then tell me if 
you agree or not? The im- 
mediately-above notwithstanding, 
I genuinely enjoyed reading Chil- 
dren of Dune, right up to the last 
tenth or so, enjoyed it more than I 
enjoyed some of the books I’ve

praised unreservedly in past col- 
umns. 

And — and this is a big “and” — IF 
Berkley’s PR department is under a 
misapprehension, if this is not the 
last, final, concluding book of a 
trilogy, my main objection falls en- 
tirely apart. God knows Herbert has 
left himself all the room in the 
world for another sequel — that’s 
precisely my objection, in fact. As a 
trilogy, the Dune cycle doesn’t re- 
ally get anywhere — and after all that 
bloodshed and sacrifice, it leaves us 
only the (apparent) certainty that the 
human race is in for four thousand 
years of benevolent tyranny under a 
seemingly-compassionless alien 
(which is a misleading hint, by the 
way, so don’t be mad). Finding out 
that there was a third Dune book 
invalidated a lot of my original ob- 
jections to DM, made re-reading it 
much more pleasurable. A similar 
revelation would make CoD much 
more palatable. 

So that’s all I have to say — but 
from the feedback mail I’ve been 
getting, it’s become evident to me 
that a good many of you out there 
are fond of abominable puns (is that 
redundant?), so I can’t leave this 
topic without passing on what the 
jilted Fremen said to the cookie- 
seller: “I love-lorn o’ Dune.”

Okay. So I visited the States 
again last month, and returned 
home in the usual black 



depression — only to find that the 
barn had caved in on top of the 
firewood, that the funny little bug 
which kept returning my breakfast 
was tonsillitis, and that every single 
one of the review-books waiting for 
me in the Post Office was a dead 
dog. 1975 was an all-time boom 
year for sf ( Locus counted 890 titles 
printed), 1976 promises to be even 
bigger — and better’n 95% of the 
output strikes me as Wretched Ex- 
cess. It was all-too-tempting to turn 
out a column-full of riddled turkeys 
for you, to hang bleeding corpses 
up on these hooks for your inspec- 
tion. But I didn’t want to do that, 
somehow. I like to read Bierce — but 
I wouldn’t be Bierce for all the 
lumber in the Owl Creek Bridge. 

Clearly, it was time to Get Grun- 
tled. 

So I got on the phone, mailed off 
a few frantic requests, dug into the 
stuff I’d bought for myself in the 
stateside bookstores (Notes From 
The Bookstore again) and assem- 
bled what you are about to read. 
Next month, when I’m feeling bet- 
ter, you get the slaughtered tur- 
keys.

tion, I distinctly didn’t care for at 
all, one was so-so, and one was a 
one-joke short-short that was not 
longer than a one-joke story should 
be, but not much better either. 
What more-than-saves the book is 
the surpassing excellence of the rest 
of it. 

The clear winner is George’s 
Hugo-winning “Song For Lya,’’ 
which is no surprise. I loved that 
damn story when I first read it in 
Analog, and I loved it again on re- 
reading. Like Dune, it is one of sf’s 
rare attempts to explore spirituality. 
The only novella I can recall that 
pulled this off so successfully is 
Chad Oliver’s “The Marginal 
Man’’ — and the similarity is strik- 
ing, in that both writers examined 
the same question in depth and 
came up with exactly opposite an- 
swers. The question is, “If all men 
could achieve true one-ness, at the 
cost of their individual humanity — 
should they?" George’s protagonists 
find, as Lazarus Long did in 
Methuselah' s Children, that there is 
no elegant solution: you pays your 
self and you takes your choice. 
Check out “Song For Lya” and 
find out the choices made, and their 
consequences. It’s not at all a 
flashy, “read-me!” kind of story — 
instead it’s thoughtful, intriguing, 
and masterfully paced, alternately 
heart-warming and — chilling. After 
finishing it, you’re liable to spend 
the next hour or two in deep 
thought — and that’s the highest 
praise I’ve got. 



Also excellent were “With Morn- 
ing Comes Mistfall,” a wistful 
examination of the conflict between 
those who want a sense of wonder 
and those who cannot tolerate one; 
and “The Second Kind of Loneli- 
ness,” a diary-type story of a soli- 
tary Gate-keeper in the empty depths 
of deep space, who learns that he 
was much lonelier on a crowded 
Earth. Both stories are distinguished 
by unusually striking visual imag- 
ery, evoking with a few words a 
splendor that no artist born could 
ever render, and both contain some 
splendidly real characters. The re- 
maining goodie, “Override,” has 
less to say: it’s “merely” an adven- 
ture. But it sticks in the mind be- 
cause of its marvelously crafted 
mood, and the warm, sweet horror 
to which it builds. 

About the ones I didn’t like: 
some disappointed me by telegraph- 
ing their endings, but if you aren’t 
the kind of fan(atic) who’s Heard It 
All Before, you may find them 
satisfying if minor. The only certifi- 
able duds are “Run To Starlight,” 
a dumb story of interspecies foot- 
ball; “The Exit To San Breta,” a 
silly fantasy about a haunted Edsel; 
and “Slide Show,” a non-story 
with a beginning but no middle or 
end (two guys with opposing view- 
points air them, and then the curtain 
comes down). 

But I repeat and insist that the 
good stuff in Song For Lya is so 
dazzlingly good that it would cover 
a much greater multitude of sins.

Prices being what they are these

luva bargain for this one. George

Somehow, or other, I forgot to 
tell you about Kate Wilhelm’s Infin- 
ity Box collection when I got it a 
few months ago — just too damned 
many books in this office. My 
humble apologies to Ms. Wilhelm, 
and a hearty exhortation to you to 
go out and find it. It rated 90% on 
the Spidermeter, 8 of its 9 stories 
being thoroughly satisfying, some 
of them superb. 

Wilhelm is a superbly polished 
craftsman (craftsperson? Aw, scroo 
dat gobbidge), and “The Infinity 
Box,” “The Time Piece,” “April 
Fool’s Day Forever,” “Where 
Have You Been, Billy Boy?”, and 
particularly “The Village” are 
stories so good as to go a long way 
toward backing up the claims of 
Barry Malzberg (on the flyleaf) and 
Dan Miller (Locus) that she is one 
of the best practitioners of the short 
story in or out of sf. 

I must qualify that just a bit, in 
order to be of any use to you. It 
don’t help for the reviewer to say 
“it’s great” or “it stinks” unless

he tries to convey as well why he 
thinks so: my feedback-mail tells 
me that the chances of your taste 
matching mine book-for-book is 
vanishingly slight. 

So I say, not as criticism but as 
explanation, that these stories are 
more “literary” than they are 
“down-home,” more “speculative 
fiction” than “science fiction.” A 
Laumer fan or a Niven addict will 
probably enjoy them much less than 
would say, an Orbit - lover or a 
late-period Silverberg man. John 
Campbell' would probably have 
bounced most of them. Does that 
help any? 

* * * 

None of that last paragraph, how- 
ever, applies to Wilhelm’s new 
novel, Where Late The Sweet Birds 
Sang. It is a bit more catholic in 
appeal than her short stories tend to 
be, its story-line a more “standard” 
sf plot, its style more conventional. 
Perhaps — and I surprise myself by 
writing this — that’s why I didn’t 
enjoy it quite as much. The plot 
was a hair too standard, all-too-well 
summed up on the flyleaf — Wilhelm 
never surprised me. 

But then, that’s a purely per- 
sonal, subjective beef: I’m a 
surprise-freak. All the friends I’ve 
lent Where Late to have come back 
satisfied, and on the whole I did 
too. It is engaging despite its pre- 
dictability: the machinery may be 
standard-issue — but it is utterly 
noiseless. 



What’s that? You want a plot 
summary? Okay: an unspecified 
byproduct of Dat Old Debbil 
technology sterilizes the human 
race, a chillingly plausible proposi- 
tion. But before it’s too late, a 
handful of the best and brightest 
lick the cloning problem, allowing 
survival of the race. .after a fash- 
ion. That’s all I’m gonna spill, ex- 
cept to say that the ensuing compli- 
cations, while almost inevitable, are 
made damned interesting by 
Wilhelm’s abundant insight into the 
nature of human-ness, however it 
reproduces. 

Is originality a function of indi- 
viduality? It sure and hell seems 
like it, to Wilhelm and to me.

You can’t use the Spidermeter on 
a three-story collection, so the hell 
with it. Here we have The Long 
Arm of Gil Hamilton: two novellae 
and a novelette covering the 
exploits of Gil Hamilton, the Man 
From ARM. Mating science fiction 
and detective-mystery fiction is- 
much more difficult than it might 
seem to a non-writer — as Larry 
himself tells you in his Afterword. 
And nowhere has it been more 
beautifully done than in this book. 

Mind you, the last novella, 
“ARM,” is only okay, distin- 
guished more by intricacy of plot- 
puzzle than anything else. Fur- 
thermore, the middle novelette, 
“The Defenseless Dead,” is only

better-than-average, not Hugo-class 
by any means. 

But the hell with that. If you 
missed “Death By Ecstasy” when 
it ran here in Galaxy in January 
1969 as “The Organleggers,” fly 
do not run to your bookstore and 
score this book — and don’t stop to 
get your change. “Death By 
Ecstasy” is in my opinion one of 
the best damn novellas that sf has 
ever produced, a story whose every 
detail will stay burned into your 
memory for years after you’ve for- 
gotten where you read it, a master- 
piece of sheer story-telling. It con- 
tains two of the most horrifying and 
ingenious methods of murder ever 
devised by man (equalled only by 
the method used by the protagonist 
of my own first novel, Telempath, 
forthcoming from Putnam-Berkley 
along about November, plug plug), 
set like parentheses at the story's 
beginning and end — and I defy you 
to guess the one at the end. What a 
finish! 

In between these Biercean de- 
lights is a superbly plotted story 
with a richness of invention that de- 
lighted me in spite of the fact that I 
did read the damn thing in ’69 and 
remembered it almost verbatim. 
Look: it has nothing heavier to say 
than “Organlegging isn’t nice” — 
it’s pure adventure. But it’s adven- 
ture so masterful that if they ever 
get around to updating the Science 
Fiction Hall of Fame, “Death By 
Ecstasy” will get my vote in the 
novella class. 



What a hell of an ending! Go get 
it.

Oh Jesus — four goodies left to 
cover and I’m running out of room. 
All right, dammit: trot out the 
minireviews. I can’t leave without 
recommending these. 

First, and clearly best. Not With- 
out Sorcery, Ballantine’s godsend 
re-release of one of the hardest-to- 
locate Ted Sturgeon collections. A 
clear 100% on the Spidermeter, 
which goes without saying except 
that I just said it. If a finer writer 
than Sturgeon ever existed, he for- 
got to publish — and these stories are 
some of Ted’s vintage stuff. It con- 
tains “Artnan Process”; both of the 
Ether Breather stories (outdated by 
Progress, but then so is Stranger In 
A Strange Land)’, “It”; (one of the 
classic horror stories of all time); 
and when the hell is someone going 
to have the sense to release a pac- 
kaged set of reprints of all of Stur- 
geon’s work, the way they’ve done 
for Heinlein and Ellison and Niven? 
Ghaddamit, I’m tired of haunting 
second-hand bookstores. 

Next, The Best Of Isaac Asimov. 
Isaac himself points out in his intro 
that the title is not precisely correct, 
but he also points out that a book ti- 
tled “The Pretty Good and Pretty 
Representational Stories Of Isaac 
Asimov” wouldn’t break any sales 
records. Well, it should. What you 
got here is a round dozen yarns 



BOOKSHELF

spanning Isaac’s career, with the 
emphasis on the 50s, which by 
Isaac was the Golden Age. You got 
the first story he ever published 
(“Marooned Off Vesta”), you got 
“Nightfall,” you got “The Fun 
They Had,” and you got “The Last 
Question,” which Isaac elsewhere 
calls (with characteristic candor) the 
greatest sf short story ever 
written — and who am I to argue? 
What more do you want for $1.50? 
Eight more stories? You’re faded. 
Another 100% rating. 

Science Fiction: The Great Years, 
Volume II, edited by Carol and Fred 
Pohl, is another collection of blasts 
from the past, and it stands up bet- 
ter than most of the ones I’ve seen 
so far. It contains Morrison’s classic 
“The Sack”: Sturgeon’s “Mewhu’s 
Jet” (another dated Sturgeon — but it 
plays, it plays); Bester’s “Time Is 
The Traitor”: Heinlein’s “Colum- 
bus Was A Dope”; Van Vogt’s 
“The Rull”; and a special treat: a 
novella (in collaboration with Fred- 
eric Arnold Rummer, Jr.) by Dirk 
Wylie, the semilegendary member 
of the original Futurians who was 
cut down by wartime injury before 
he could amass an output as large 
as his talent. The yarn’s nearly 
thirty years old and it creaks like 
hell, but it earns the right to occupy 
nearly half the book. Another 100% 
collection. 

The Ancient Mysteries Reader: I 
must admit this one surprised me. 
The current Ancient Mysteries craze 
(you know, Von Daniken, 



Stonehenge, Atlantis, Loch Nessie, 
like that) generally gives me a soft 
pain beneath the wallet — a failing in 
me, perhaps. At least, this collec- 
tion by newcomer Peter Haining 
makes me think so. Marvelous 
stories, two apiece on nine A.M. 
themes, by an American and En- 
glish cast diverse enough to include 
Poe, Wells, Sax Rohmer, Geoffrey 
Household (whose name is admit- 
tedly not a Geoffrey word), Love- 
craft (of course), Harry Harrison, 
Robert Bloch, Sturgeon and — for 
heaven’s sake — Leslie Charteris’s 
immortal Simon Templar! And yes, 
this too rates a full 100%.

about the rightmost column on it,

Miss Sliggett, the principal, was 
standing before her desk, wiping 
her bifocals and slowly shaking her

Butch plucked tentatively at a

mystifying card. 

“Well,” continued Miss Sliggett, 
“I’m certainly glad to be wrong, in 
this case. Frankly,” she said, re- 
placing her spectacles, “I can’t im- 
agine how you did it, getting all 
A’s last period. I suspect you’ve

“At any rate, I just wanted to 
congratulate you myself,” the prin- 
cipal said, returning to her chair, 
"and to tell you to keep in touch 
after you’ve gone on to high school. 
That’s all.” She managed a prim 
smile. “Good luck — Butch.” 

Butch managed a return grunt and

The ballroom of a certain 
Washington hotel was in a mild up- 
roar. The announcement of the 
press conference had come suddenly 
and unexpectedly, as mutely at- 
tested to by the unlikely number of 
unfinished drinks sitting in several 
bars throughout the capital. Specula- 
tion was loudly rampant concerning 
the purpose of the conference; some 
supposed it to be the announcement 
of yet another political rebirth, the 
more cynical guessed it was to be a 
nationwide appeal for funds. The 



most cynical figured it was simply a 
hype for the book, which wasn’t 
selling nearly as well as was ex- 
pected. 

Without fanfare the ex-President 
strode in, strangely exultant. He as- 
sumed the podium and began 
briskly, confidently. “Ladies and 
gentlemen of the press. I have a 
very important statement to make. I 
will be brief.” 

A heavy murmur ran through the 
ranks of the news media. “Look at 
that,” said a TV correspondent, 
nudging his compatriot, amazed. 
“He’s not sweating — there’s not a 
bead of sweat on him!” Several 
others remarked on the absence of 
the customary nervous, frozen, 
forced grin on the visage of the 
former Chief of State. It had been 
replaced by an easy, confident smile. 
Apprehension surged through the 
crowd. 

The ex-President waiL., for the 
swell to subside. “First of all, I’m 
very glad to see you all again.” 

Muttered sarcasms floated up 
from the assembly. The speaker 
raised a hand, smiling sadly. 
"Please,” he said, “in times past, 
it would have been an untruth for 
me to tell you that. But try and be- 
lieve me when I say it now. The 
ill-will I bore you then came largely 
out respect for your power, and, in- 
deed, more than a little fear. I shall 
try and set things right with the 
statement I am about to make.” He

paused a moment. “The statement 
is this: Earlier today I visited the 
Federal District Court of 
Washington, D.C. and swore out a 
series of affidavits attesting to my 
involvement and/or compliance in a 
number of crimes and mis- 
demeanors. Following that, I met 
with the President of the United 
States and petitioned him to revoke, 
in the interests of justice and fair- 
ness, a certain Presidential order re- 
garding those selfsame crimes.” 

There was absolute silence. Then 
an elderly stringer from a Midwest- 
ern daily clutched convulsively at 
his chest and was reluctantly carried 
out by two of his colleagues. 

“I will entertain a few questions 
before proceeding with the second 
part of my statement,” said the re- 
tired chief executive, smiling. 

Again there was silence. Finally, 
a grizzled veteran of the Fourth Es- 
tate, long known as possibly the 
most cynical member of a cynical 
profession, got to his feet and 
drawled, “Sir, during your term of 
office, in a recorded private confer- 
ence at which this very matter was 
raised, you said — now let me quote 
you exactly — ” There were some 
snickers as he riffled through the 
pages of a large, well-worn 
notebook, “You said, ‘gentlemen, 
you can be assured that this infor- 
mation will become public only 
when Hell freezes over.’ ” The 
expletive was not deleted. “How do 
you explain this about-face, sir?” 

The reporter sat down lazily, 



while the rest of the press braced it- 
self. 

To everyone’s surprise, the man 
at the podium looked sheepishly 
toward the floor, and after a long si- 
lence, said quietly, “Sir, every man 
must answer for himself — if not in 
this world, then the next. I prefer to 
discharge my obligations and to 
take my medicine here and now.” 

His words were entirely free of 
the phony homiletic quality which 
had often caused inward, and at the 
end, outward groans among the 
press under similar circumstances. 
This was truly a confession. 

The speaker asked for further 
questions, and when there were 
none from the hushed throng, he 
proceeded with the rest of his 
statement, and steadily spun out a 
collection of names, dates, and 
events of such harrowing sordidity 
that it caused the grizzled hackles of 
that cynical old reporter to rise and 
his pencil to drop from nerveless 
fingers.

Meanwhile, all Hell was breaking 
loose. In the lavishly-appointed 
boardroom, Satan stubbed out his 
fourth cigarette in as many minutes. 
“Now tell me,’’ he bellowed, 
“what in Hell’s going on?” 

The foul fiend Flibbertygibbet, 
Chief of Operations, stood up ner- 
vously after much prodding from his 
neighbors at the conference table. 
“I-I-It ap-p-pears to b-b-be the 
weather, sir,” he said, through

chattering teeth. He was wearing 
only a tropical-weight suit. 

“Damn right it’s the weather!” 
roared Satan, turning up the collar 
of his chesterfield, “What I want to 
know is why l” The fog of exhala- 
lion accompanying that last word, 
tinged with crystalline sulfur, made 
a spectacular little snowfall when it 
froze to solidity and tinkled down 
along about the middle of the table. 

“We don’t know, sir,” came a 
voice and a vapor cloud from inside 
the snorkel hood of an Air Force 
parka. 

“Who’s that in there?” snarled 
Satan. 

“It’s Beelzebub, sir,” came the 
muffled voice. 

"You look stupid.” The Prince 
of Darkness glared around the table. 
"All right, then, you boobs don’t 
know, get me someone who does!” 

“Humba meyerolgisser?” said 
Mammon, raising his forepaw. 

“Mammon, get that damn scarf 
off your face so I can hear what 
you’re saying!” shouted Satan, 
stamping his hooves to restore the 
circulation. 

“Yes, sir,” said Mammon, claw- 
ing at his West Point muffler. “I 
said, ‘How about a meteorologist, 
sir?’ ” 

“How about one, indeed! Have 
we got any around?” 

“Oh, yessir,” said Mammon 
warmly, “there’s a special place in 
Hell for meteorologists.” He pulled 
out a pocket-sized map of Hell from 
the folds of his army greatcoat and 



consulted it closely. “Let’s see, 
they’re in the Special Sector, just 
south of the life insurance salesmen. 
I can get you one in just under three 
hours,” he beamed. 

“Three hours!” bellowed Satan. 
“The Special Sector’s only a five- 
minute drive from here! What are 
you gonna do — walk?” 

“Actually, sir, I was thinking of 
taking a soulsled. You see, none of 
the cars will start this morning.” 

“All right, then, get on it! What 
in the hell is this place coming to? 
What are you still standing up for, 
booby?” 

This last remark was directed at 
Flibbertygibbet, who was still at 
rigid attention in his cream-colored 
dacron suit, a purplish cast to his 
normally ruddy features. 

“I don’t think he can sit, sir,” 
volunteered the succubus sitting 
next to him, who was bundled in a 
heavy mackintosh, “he appears to 
be frozen.” 

“Well, of course he is, in that 
toilet-paper suit! Why isn’t he wear- 
ing something warm?” 

"He just flew in from a meeting 
in Akron, sir, and came straight 
here. I’ll thaw him out, sir,” she 
said, with a cold, yet somehow 
obscene, smile. 

“Do that,” said Satan. “And 
let’s get some space heaters in 
here!” he roared.

Dave Pirelli, programmer, was 
daubing a slice of bread with peanut

butter for his two-year-old son. 
“Voila!” he said, as he lay down 
the knife and presented the comesti- 
ble to his son with a flourish. It fell 
on the floor. Dave utttered a benign 
curse. Somewhat to his surprise, 
however, it had landed sticky side 
up. Dave scooped it up, checked 
the bottom for overt filth, and 
handed it to his son, who, in his 
zeal, fumbled it and dropped it 
again. To Dave’s utter amazement 
the peanut butter side had again 
missed contact with the floor. Dave 
mumbled something, and while his 
son happily coated himself inside 
the out with the peanut-butter 
sandwich, Dave hastily prepared 
another one. This one he threw into 
the air. Again, no net transfer of 
peanut butter to floor. A strange 
chill came over him. He shrugged it 
off, and holding the slice at eye 
level, peanut-butter-side-down, 
dropped it. Right-side up, again. 
Dave picked it up and munched it 
meditatively. 

He gave the remainder of the del- 
icacy to his son, who was once 
again looking at him with imploring 
eyes. He slapped a layer of peanut 
butter on another piece of bread and 
ran out the back door to the balcony 
of his fourth-floor apartment, where 
he flipped the sandwich over the 
railing. He watched its fluttering 
trajectory, and noted that the little 
square that came to rest on the 
sidewalk below was brown, not 
white. He thought a moment, snap- 
ped his fingers, and went inside, 



just as three squirrels came charging 
around the side of the building in 
tight hunting formation. 

Inside, Dave repeated the same 
series of experiments with pieces of 
jellybread, with the same results. 
Dave pondered this for a moment or 
two, then a broad smile broke 
across his face. His sticky-surfaced 
son, finishing off the last slice of 
jellybread, looked up at his father 
with adoration. Then Dave crowed, 
grabbed his coat, and yelled to his 
wife, "T’m going to the Comp 
Center, Liz! My program’s going to 
run!”

Father McConnelly stopped in his 
tracks. The two altar boys flanking 
him also pulled up short, both in 
mid-yawn. The sleepiness of Father 
McConnelly was jarred from him in 
an instant as before him he saw a 
vision more awesome than any mys- 
tic’s. Rank upon rank of pews, each 
crammed to its limit with hushed 
and reverent humanity. The massed 
rustle of their rising at his entrance 
sounded to him as the mighty rush 
of the pinions of a troop of angels. 
And more of the faithful were 
crowding in at the doors. The two 
octogenarian ushers were helpless to 
direct the swelling tide. 

And this at seven o’clock mass 
on a weekday morning. 

The right-hand altar boy dropped 
his bell. The jubilant Father didn’t 
hear it at all as he strode forth 



124

across the sanctuary, voicing clearly 
audible hosannahs. The altar boys 
scurried after him unsteadily and 
took up their positions, as the priest 
began a triumphant Introit with the 
glory of the saints suffusing his 
beaming countenance.

In the Kremlin the monstrous 
doors of the hall of the Presidium 
moved ponderously open. A senior 
aide emerged, with a sheaf of pa- 
pers in his hand. His air of cold 
dignity was disturbed by a notice- 
able twitching of his lower lip. 
Another aide, Pyotr Vassilyevich 
Grunin by name, waiting at his post 
in the corridor, watched the other’s 
approach apprehensively. He ner- 
vously massaged his throat in the un- 
conscious habit he had acquired in 
the old days. The guards bracketing 
the great doors made small, shifting 
movements as the heels of the senior 
aide clicked across the marble floor 
to where Pyotr Vassilyevich waited. 

The senior aide’s lack of compo- 
sure was obvious to Pyotr, who 
owed his continued existence to 
being minutely aware of such 
things. The senior aide took a deep 
breath and spoke. 

“You will have these directives 
printed, tovarishch, and distributed 
to every party official in the land 
for immediate implementation.” 

Pyotr’s breath caught. “ Och - 
yistka!” he thought, “Purge! — 
Again!” 



The papers shook slightly as they 
were handed over. The senior aide 
abruptly turned on his heel and 
clicked back across the corridor. 
Pyotr Vassilyevich swallowed the 
lump in his throat and began to scan 
the pages, heart racing. Suddenly 
his eyes widened and he began to 
flip the pages back and forth as 
small inarticulate noises issued from 
his mouth. “Semyon Semyon- 
ovich!” he cried out. 

The senior aide, nearly at the 
door, turned stiffly. 

“These — these directives,” Pyotr 
stammered, “they — they call for the 
immediate dismantling of the prison 
system, and — and for open emigra- 
tion, and,” he paused and swal- 
lowed, and after looking about him 
nervously whispered, “and for the 
institution of free elections!” Unac- 
customed tears were welling in his 
eyes. 

Semyon Semyonovich nodded 
slowly. He added, in a solemn, yet 
strangled, tone, “By unanimous 
vote of the Presidium.”

Down in Hell, the lights flickered 
out in the middle of the 
meteorologist’s presentation. Three 
minutes of Stygian darkness ensued, 
punctuated by the roaring of demons 
and the crying of lost souls. Then 
the lights came dimly on again. The 
electric space heaters, which had 
been brought in when the small 
brimstone models had sputtered out, 
began to whir again, faintly. 



ABANDON ALL HEAT.

“All right, what was that all 
about?” demanded the Prince of 
Darkness, now at the stub-end of 
his temper. 

Moloch, Chief Engineer for Heat- 
ing and Power, came scurrying in 
from the communications center, his 
unwieldy mukluks impeding his 
progress. “We’ve lost hydroelectric 
power, sir,” he panted, “the Styx 
has frozen over. We’ve gone over 
to storage batteries for the time be- 
ing, but if the temperature keeps on 
dropping we’ll shortly reach the 
point where the electrochemical 
reaction will cease to be of practical 
speed.” 

“Aargh!” said Satan, and rubbed 
the base of his left horn. He was 
beginning to feel a migraine coming 
on. 

A young demon, trimly attired in 
a Head down ski parka, neatly fitted 
with grommetted horn apertures, 
saw his chance and spoke up. He 
was Moloch’s third assistant in 
charge of Planning and Outre Tor- 
ment. 

“Begging your pardon, sir,” he 
said, a little smugly, addressing Sa- 
tan, “but you will no doubt recall 
that over three millenia ago I advo- 
cated modernization of our 
facilities, that is, power-plant-wise, 
going over from fossil fuels- 
supported electric furnaces to 
atomic pile and controlled fusion. 
Certainly, sir, it’s obvious that the 
present difficulty need never have 
happened, had I not been silenced 
and stonewalled by certain jealous 



and reactionary elements in the 
power structure, whose outmoded 
ideas date from the time of the 
Fall!” He finished off looking stem 
and efficient. He spared himself a 
triumphant glance at Moloch, who 
was staring back with blazing eyes. 

Satan cast a weary look at the 
young demon, then gestured with 
the third finger of his left hand. The 
shocked expression on the demon’s 
face melted onto the floor with the 
rest of him. Only a ripstop ski outfit 
and a playboy key remained atop 
the congealing puddle that was once 
an up-and-coming executive. 

“Snot-nose know-it-all,” growled 
Satan. “Dammit, Moloch,” he 
shouted, whirling to face the engi- 
neer, who quickly truncated a sigh of 
relief, “what in Hell’s going on 
here? That blast should have vap- 
orized him. All it did was make 
him runny!” 

Moloch spread his upper arms 
helplessly. “It’s part of the general 
phenomenon, sir. We’re working on 
it.” 

“Then get your asses in gear,” 
Satan stormed. “And you, he said, 
pointing a hairy foreclaw at the 
shivering weatherman, “finish up!” 

The blue and naked weatherman, 
the cold making a grotesque parody 
of his sunburn-blistered skin, turned 
to the huge weathermap setup to 
which he was permanently attached 
by a heavy chain surgically affixed 
to his abdomen. 

He went into a long recital about 
low-pressure areas and isotherms, 



126 



GALAXY 




rattled off the record temperatures 
for that date for the past seventeen 
centuries, remarking that today’s 
was a new all-time low, and 
finished off with gloomy predictions 
for the weekend. 

“So?” That was Satan. “What 
do we do about it?” 

The meteorologist smiled his 
brightest TV smile. “Well, sir,” he 
chuckled, “as the great humorist 
Mark Twain once said, 'Everybody 
talks about the weather, but 
nobody d — ’ 

He was interrupted as the eight- 
foot icicle hurled by Satan pierced 
his body. He contorted with pain 
and broke off, looking chastened. 

“Chain him to a glacier,” or- 
dered Satan, disgusted. Two burly 



sloth-demons hauled the hapless 
criminal out by the arms, the 
enormous weathermap which ema- 
nated from his belly dragging along 
after him. 

“Any other bright ideas?” 
queried Satan, looking around the 
table. They all thought he looked 
quite amusing with slaver freezing 
into his goatee, but of course, none 
dared laugh. 

Just then Mephistopheles, in 
charge of Field Operations and 
Liaison, scrambled around the bulk 
of the weathermap board which was 
wedged in the doorway. The fiend, 
after extracting himself from the 
impediment, smoothed the ruffled 
nap of his yakskin cloak, and pro- 
ceeded to Satan’s side with as much

haste as dignity would allow. Mak- 
ing a rather theatrical bow, he drew 
forth a communique from within the 
folds of his cloak, and with ill- 
concealed excitement, he an- 
nounced, “I can tell you the nature 
of our problem, sire.” He paused 
dramatically. "It’s the Maxwell’s 
Demons — they’re on strike!”

Dave Pirelli lit a cigarette and 
grinned. “Enter at your peril,” he 
said in answer to the knock on his 
office door. In walked Cy 
Bergmann, Project Director. 

"Congratulations, Dave,” he 
beamed, "I hear you got the exec 
program debugged. Great job! 
How’d you do it?” 

Dave leaned back in his chair. 
"Loaded it,” he said matter-of- 
factly. 

"Yeah, right,” said Cy, planting 
himself on Dave’s desk, "but what 
did you do before you loaded it? 
Whatever it was obviously clob- 
bered your lunch hour.” He indi- 
cated the peanut butter sandwich 
Dave was fabricating. 

Dave cocked his head and re- 
garded Cy. “Not a damn thing did I 
do to it, Cy,” he answered, "I 
simply knew that it would run, so I 
loaded it.” 

“What the hell are you talking 
about?” hollered Cy, who hated 
false modesty, “That was the most 
untraceably glitch-ridden hunk of 
code I’ve seen in ten years!” 



“Well,” said Dave, licking the 
knife, “there are glitches and then 
there are glitches. Some of them 
people are responsible for, and 
others — well . .” He pitched the 
slice of bread into the comer. 

“Hey! What are you throwing 
your lunch around for?” 

“It’s not my lunch,” Dave an- 
swered, smiling. “You notice any- 
thing funny about that sandwich?” 
“Hey, lookithat,” said Cy de- 
lightedly, “it landed right-side up. 
They never do that. Lucky you. So 
why’re you slinging your vittles 
around?” 

Dave was serious. “Watch,” he 
said, as he retrieved the sandwich 
and flipped it in the air again. 

Cy’s brows furrowed at the re- 
sult. He shook his head. “They al- 
ways land sticky-side-down,” he 
muttered, "Funny.” 

“Sure, they always do,” agreed 
Dave, “and why do they?” 

Cy shrugged. "Murphy’s Law,” 
he said. Everyb — ” he stopped 
and a strange look came into his 
eyes. “The exec program — are you 
trying to tell me. ?” 

“Not only the program, Cy. You 
know the experimental modular 
processor they’re building down the 
hall? The one that’s down oftener 
than the stock market? Well, it’s up 
and running like a demon. Inciden- 
tally,” he said, scooping up the 
sandwich, "so’s the stock market. 
What I’m trying to say is,” he add- 
ed, munching happily, “Murphy’s 
Law’s been repealed!”

In Geneva, a minor altercation 
occurred at the current round of 
strategic arms limitation discus- 
sions. Soviet envoy Gornyekov 
dropped a bombshell. He announced 
that his country would begin a pol- 
icy of unilateral nuclear arms cut- 
back effective immediately, and 
added that he guessed that would 
show who was serious about world 
peace and who wasn’t. 

The conference room erupted. 
The American chief negotiator, 
Wilmer Perkins, was particularly 
volcanic, for his thunder had been 
stolen. 

"Izzat so?” he shouted, hurling 
his hatchet face across the confer- 
ence table. "Well, for your infor- 
mation, Mister Gornyekov, the U.S. 
of A. began unilaterally dismantling 
its nuclear strike force this morning! 
How d’ya like them onions?” 

“Ha!” exploded the Russian, “A 
typical capitalist ploy, to try and 
jump on the troika after someone 
else has hitched the horses!” 

“Typical Commie boondoggle, 
you mean, to flash that sickle of 
yours and holler ‘Time to get 
mowin!’ when we’ve got the 
hay wagon halfway to the barn!” re- 
torted Perkins. 

They glowered murderously at 
each other for a long moment, then 
neither one could contain himself 
any longer. They both collapsed 
into uproarious laughter and em- 
braced each other across the table. 



Gornyekov kissed Perkins on both 
cheeks and Perkins tweaked Gor- 
nyekov ’s nose. 

The representatives on both sides 
sat in speechless amazement. It was 
a while before either chief 
negotiator could speak. 

“We sure had ’em goin’, didn’t 
we, Dmitri?” howled Perkins. 

"This is true, Wilmer," roared 
the Russian, wiping away tears of 
laughter. 

Perkins, still chuckling, massaged 
the stitch in his side and announced, 
"This was a little act me and 
Dmitri cooked up this morning after 
we got the word from our govern- 
ments.” He winked. "Bet you guys 
thought World War III was gonna 
start right here, didn’t you?” 

Dmitri began to laugh hugely 
again at the very idea, grabbed Per- 
kins in a terrific bear hug, and 
called out, over the swelling uproar, 
for vodka.

In a well-to-do section of Genoa, 
Luigi Donatellini, arriving at his 
girl friend’s flat, did not beat her 
up. He always beat her up when his 
cantankerous Ferrari did not per- 
form perfectly on the way down 
from Rome. Today the Ferrari per- 
formed perfectly on the way down 
from Rome. So, he did not beat her 
up. Instead, he asked her to become 
Signora Donatellini. She dropped 
the Beretta she had been holding 
behind her back and joyfully, with 
tears, accepted.

“Who in Hell are Maxwell’s 
Demons?” Satan thundered, losing 
all patience, “I thought all the de- 
mons down here were mine l" 

"Oh, yes, quite, sir,” chuckled 
Mephisopheles, a little patroniz- 
ingly, some thought. Lucky for him 
he’d racked up plenty of brownie 
points in his field work. “It’s just a 
trick of nomenclature — they’re 
known on Earth by the name of the 
mortal who first conjectured upon 
their existence. One James Clerk 
Maxwell, physicist, inhabiting Earth 
Sector Britain approximately one 
century ago. Actually, Maxwell’s 
Demons are a group of Class D-4 
drones. Enforcement type, residing 
in Sector SE-23. That’s on the 
nether slope of Mt. Erebus.” 

“I know where in hell Sector 
SE-23 is,” Satan snapped, “That’s 
the town dump for Erebus Heights. 
What I want to know is A) What 
has them being on strike got to do 
with Hell being an icebox, and B) 
How fast can we vaporize the trou- 
blemaking subversive bastards and 
get things back on an even keel?!” 

Mephistopheles sighed deeply and 
raised his hands in a operatic ges- 
ture of despair. There was shifting 
and muttering around the table. His 
histrionics were damn hard to take, 
especially at a time like this. He 
spoke. 

“It’s not that simple, sire,” he 
said, a trifle deprecatingly, “I’m 
afraid de-etherealizing them is out 

130 



of the question. First, because de- 
etherealizing them is not exactly a 
viable option in these straits,” he 
spread his hands to indicate the 
general frostiness, “and, more criti- 
cally, they are, I believe, more es- 
sential to the function of this mighty 
concern than anyone has hitherto 
realized.” Here he stopped, cocked 
an artistically-plucked eyebrow, and 
sent a direful gaze around the table. 

What a ham, Satan thought, 
slamming an antacid the size of a 
pingpong ball into his mouth. Still, 
that act went over big in the 
provinces — he had the highest pro- 
ductivity rating of any agent in his 
territory. Some kind of crazy appeal 
to Earth Sector mortals. Besides, 
Satan reminded himself, he seemed 
to have some kind of handle on the 
problem. He massaged his now 
violently-throbbing horn and sighed, 
“All. right, ’Stoph, suppose you 
take a seat and fill us in on every- 
thing you know. But make it 
qu ic k — hellsapoppi n ! ” 

Mephistopheles bowed. “I would 
fain stand, my liege,” he intoned. 
Groans around the table once more. 
Everyone knew he preferred to pace 
back and forth during his declama- 
tory' delivery, with his cape swirling 
dramatically at every turn. 

“O.K., O.K.,” Satan growled, 
“Just get started. First of all tell me 
what they do. I can’t be expected to 
keep track of every goddam D-4 
Enforcement Drone in this place. 
That’s what a personnel depart- 
ment’s for.” 



GALAXY 




“You must understand my infor- 
mation is also sketchy, sire,” said 
Mephistopheles, beginning his 
perambulations. “I was familiar 
with them in little more than name 
when this,” he paused portentously 
and held up the communique, “list 
of demands came into my hands. I 
took the liberty of consulting the 
Demon Index at the Registry of 
Fiends on my way here. My per- 
sonal copy of Who's Who in Hell 
also yielded some valuable bits of in- 
formation. 

“I discovered that Maxwell’s 
demons are an essentially submi- 
croscopic group of quasi-entities 
whose main duty is the enforcement 
of Murphy’s Law. They are also 
charged with overseeing enforce- 
ment of the Second Law of Ther- 
modynamics. They perform their 
function through local manipulations 
of entropy. They discharge their re- 
sponsibilities so well, so efficiently 
and creatively, I’m afraid no one’s 
taken any notice of them for some 
time.” He smiled ruefully. “They 
seem, from this communication, to 
Ire quite annoyed at this lack of rec- 
ognition. In fact, their quartering in 
the Erebus Heights town dump 
seems to be a particularly sore point 
with them.” 

From Satan there came an in- 
choate blur of epithets, impreca- 
tions, and demonic yells, dotted 
here and there with an intelligible 
word, such as “Murphy”, “ther- 
modynamic”, and “entropy”. It en- 
tered into a crescendo of blood- 



curdling screams and ended with a 
question mark. 

“Well, in answer to your ques- 
tion, sire, I’ll explain as much as I 
am able. But perhaps you’d first 
like to peruse this list.” He ten- 
dered the parchment into Satan’s 
violently-twitching claws and judi- 
ciously stepped back. 

Satan’s feral yellow eyes grew 
wider and yellower as they roved 
the page, his cilious lips moving 
wordlessly. Slowly, he laid the page 
on the table, then suddenly loosed a 
barrage of blasphemies, rages, 
obscenities, and chaos-invoking in- 
vectives that made his previous out- 
burst seem like a Quaker homily. It 
fairly blistered the arctic air, and 
those ringing the table were torn be- 
tween the necessity of dodging the 
hellish blast and the desire to hud- 
dle closer to it for warmth. It is 
doubtful whether such a world- 
wrecking stream of expletives was 
ever heard before, the time of the 
Fall included. The succubus fainted. 

At its end, Satan lapsed into a 
semi-comatose state, and Mephis- 
topheles spoke, after a decorous 
cough, “While our esteemed foun- 
der is — er — collecting his thoughts, 
perhaps I can enumerate the articles 
submitted for negotiation. Briefly, 
they want immediate relocation of 
their headquarters to a more hospit- 
able area — they suggest East Pur- 
gatory as their first choice.” 

All the fiends gasped as one. To 
reside in the posh suburb, with its 
balmy climate and its invigorating 



ABANDON ALL HEAT. 



131 




hot springs, was the province of only 
the highest-echelon executives. It 
was the Infernal Riviera, practi- 
cally. Beelzebub, who lived there 
himself, whined in dismay. 

“Secondly,” continued Mephis- 
topheles, raising his long-fingered 
hand for silence, “they demand 
Sundays off and double-time for 
night work.” 

Another gasp. Sunday was the 
crash production day, and 
nights? — that’s when all the sub- 
stantive work was accomplished. 

“Additionally, there’s a list of 
fringe benefits here; profit-sharing, 
sulfur-mine stock options, sabbatical 
leave — whatever that means — and a 
few others. Finally,” he took a 
deep breath, “they demand we 
submit to binding arbitration with 
the, ah,” he cast his eyes upward, 
“Competition as agents.” 

The ensuing commotion caused 
Satan to stir. “Hail, horrors, hail,” 
he muttered, coming around, “Bet- 
ter to reign in Hell than — ” He sat 
bolt upright, eyes wide, and expel- 
led a long, smoky breath. “Where 
were we?” he asked. 

“I was just getting to the "or- 
else” clause, sire. If their demands 
are not met immediately they will 
cease production perpetually and, 
quote, ‘take this pit down so close 
to absolute zero that it won’t make 
a difference.’ Unquote.” 

It was a lulu of a migraine. 
“Bullshit they will,” Satan 
growled, “I’ll personally de- 
etherealize every last one of them!” 



Mephistopheles looked pained. 
“I’m afraid they can do everything 
they claim, sire.” 

“How, dammit?” 

Mephistopheles spread his arms 
in a deprecating Gallic shrug. “By 
the time-honored method of 
entropy-manipulation, I should 
think,” he answered. “As you 
know, sire, my specialty has always 
been the arts. I know somewhat of 
these matters, being a bit of a dilet- 
tante, a Renaissance man, if you 
will. But perhaps your best course 
is to consult someone in the En- 
gineering Section. Chief Engineer 
Moloch, preferably. It would cer- 
tainly help to know their strengths 
and weaknesses before commencing 
negotiations.” 

“Negotiations, hell!” screamed 
Satan, rising with such vehemence 
as to send his massive throne clat- 
tering over backward. “I built this 
operation up from a two-bit lake of 
fire and a crummy Mesopotamian 
fruit stand, and I’m damned,” he 
smashed the table for emphasis, “if 
I’m going to be pushed around by a 
collection of socialistic submicro- 
scopic near-entities! Forget negotia- 
tions! No way! Never!” 

lust then the lights went out. 
There was momentary silence. 

“Get Moloch,” said a weary 
Satanic voice in the darkness.

stood poised in the conference room

slices of peanut-butter bread landed 
sticky-side-up. After a moment of 
silent inspection, a joyous whoop 
went up and thirty-two delirious 
men and women charged out of the 
room to their respective terminals. 

The usually reserved Cy 
Bergmann was performing a varia- 
tion of the Mexican Hat Dance 
among the snacks. “Do you know 
what this means?” he cried. “It 
means early completion; it means 
we bring it in under budget; it 
means bonuses!” His tone dropped 
to a reverent whisper. “It means a 
Mercedes.” Then he yippeed again. 
“All we have to do is crank out 
code for the next two weeks and the 
entire software system is up and 
purring!” 

Dave nodded placidly. They 
toasted each other in peanut butter.

Something snapped in Edgar 
Messertrager’s brain. He didn’t feel 
like chasing people with ice picks 
any more. In fact, he couldn’t even 
remember ever wanting to chase 
people with ice picks. He looked 
around him at the mattresses on the 
walls and scratched his head in 
perplexity. He shrugged and walked 
over to the tiny barred window set 



into the door and good-naturedly 
asked for assistance. 

All over the Slippery Bottom 
State Hospital, things were snapping 
in people’s brains. Costanza 
Schwartz didn’t want to set fire to 
her uncle’s garage any more; Char- 
lie Swanson didn’t want to pop out 
of bushes naked any more; Stavros 
Mavrodopoulos didn’t want to 
prophesy doom and eat bugs any 
more; Dr. William T. Nelson, the 
director of the asylum, didn’t want 
to pretend he was God any more. 
These were all the furthest things 
from their respective minds.

Likewise in the Ikhallala Flats 
State Penitentiary. Those who didn’t 
have things snap in their brains — 
such as the desires variously to kill, 
rob, rape, and cheat — were all cry- 
ing with remorse over the killing, 
robbing, raping, and cheating they 
had done. The uproar was like that 
generally associated with a riot, but 
no guards rushed in. Which was 
just as well. They were too far gone 
into remorseful weeping themselves 
to be of much use.

Frost now glistened on the 
paneled walls of the boardroom. 
Demons of various sizes and con- 
formations, wearing a motley dis- 
tribution of heavy garments, were 
stamping up and down the length of

the room, earnestly flapping their 
arms, wings, and other, more 
bizarre, appendages. A blackboard 
had been set up near the middle of 
the table, where sat Mephistopheles, 
Moloch, and two or three aides, 
conversing in low tones, a massive 
pile of documents before them. 
Overhead the lights fluctuated errat- 
ically, casting upon the scene an 
eerie, even sinister, light. 

Satan popped his fifth Valium 
and washed it down with very cold 
water. Moloch looked up and an- 
nounced, “I think we’re ready now, 
sir.” 

“About time,” rumbled Satan, 
raising the earflaps of his newly- 
acquired Sherpa mountaineer’s hat. 
“First fill me in on the power situa- 
tion.” 

“Yes, sir. Well, by the time the 
batteries went, I was prepared to 
patch the generators into the tread- 
mills on the Sisyphus Project. We 
managed the switchover without too 
much downtime, but as you can 
see,” he made a wry face at the 
rapidly oscillating lights, “half- 
frozen lost souls are not the most 
dependable power source.” 

“Are the damned things going to 
poop out?” 

“No, sir,” Moloch replied, “we 
can work them in shifts as long as 
we need to. Our big problem 
now — and it is big— is that the lu- 
bricants used on the treadmills — 
and on the generators, too, for that 
matter — were designed expressly for 
high-temperature environments. If 



they freeze up,” Moloch coughed 
uneasily, “well, we’re pretty much 
up the creek. In fact,” he reached 
out to take a sheet of newly- 
completed calculations from the 
fiend behind him, "a drop of 
twenty more degrees will just about 
do it. And at the projected rate of 
temperature decline,” he flipped the 
sheet over, "that point will come in 
approximately forty-three minutes.” 
Satan cursed. “All right,” he 
growled, "let’s have the report — 
quick!” 

“Indeed, sire,” said Mephis- 
topheles, rising. “First of all, are 
you familiar with the Three Laws of 
Thermodynamics?’ ’ 

“Listen!” Satan bawled, “I run a 
Place of Torment here — not a god- 
dam Institute of Technology!” 
“You’d be surprised how often 
the two are equated, sire,” Mephis- 
topheles mused. “In that case, 
perhaps Moloch had better ex- 
plain.” 

“Right,” said Moloch. “First 
Law states, as you can see on the 
board there, AE = q-w, which, it 
should be intuitively obvious, im- 
plies that the energy of the universe 
is constant. Second Law, AS = 

2 dq 

/ re v > can be ” 

i T 

“Stop!” barked Satan. He 
pointed to Mephistopheles. “You 
tell me.” 

Moloch grunted. Mephistopheles 
spoke, “Yes, sire — ah — simply 
stated, the laws are as follows -

1 . You can’t win. 

2. You can’t even break 
even. 

3. You can’t get out of the 
game. 

Mephistopheles turned to 
Moloch. "Is that a reasonably accu- 
rate formulation?” he asked. 

"Speaking in dilettante’s 
terms — yes,” said Moloch drily. 

"I don’t care,” snapped Satan, 
"those are terms I can understand.” 

"To continue, then,” sighed 
Moloch, "the Second Law, which 
is the one that immediately concerns 
us, states that in a closed universe, 
entropy is always increasing.” 

"There’s that damned entropy 
again,” Satan bellowed. "What is 
it?” 

Moloch was showing signs of 
frustration. "To state it simply, sir, 
entropy is a measure of the number 
of microscopic states associated 
with a particular macroscopic state. 
This of course means th — ” 

"Stop,” snapped Satan, pointing 
again at Mephistopheles. "State it 
simply.” 

“Yes, sire,” responded Mephis- 
topheles, scratching his head, “This 
is a bit more difficult. Ah, basi- 
cally, entropy is a measure of 
disorder — the more disordered a 
state a system is in, the higher its 
entropy.” 

“Good,” nodded Satan, “disor- 
der I can understand. Go on.” 

“The significance of entropy to 
our present situation,” continued 
Mephistopheles, “is that almost all 



physical processes result in a net in- 
crease of entropy — that is to say, 
the universe tends toward disorder. 
The reason being that there are vast- 
ly many more possible disordered 
states of anything than there are or- 
dered states of anything. Therefore 
it is vastly more probable that an ir- 
reversible process will end up in a 
disordered state than it will an or- 
dered state, relatively. And irrever- 
sible processes are much more 
common than reversible ones. All 
tolled, this means that in the real 
universe, gases tend to expand 
themselves rather than compress 
themselves, hot things tend to get 
cold,” he shivered slightly, gazing 
around him, “and never the re- 
verse, and most energy transactions 
result in less energy being available. 
In short, things in the real universe 
tend to run down. Increasing en- 
tropy is the reason for the impossi- 
bility of perpetual motion machines, 
for instance.” 

“But,” Beelzebub broke in, 
“perpetual motion machines are 
among our major exports — they’re 
our biggest bait item. You know 
that.” 

"Impossible in the real universe, 
I said. Not here.” 

Moloch added significantly, 
"Usually. But every one of our 
P-M devices ceased operating this 
morning when all this began, a state 
of affairs you will find is inti- 
mately associated with the Max- 
well’s Demons.” 

“At last,” groaned Satan, "the

nitty-gritty. Where do those com- 
munistic bastards figure in?!” 

“Well, historically, sire,” began 
Mephistopheles warmly, now secure 
in his element, “knowledge of the 
existence of these entities was first 
breached to the mortal world by the 
selfsame Clerk Maxwell, who in 
treating with the principles of the 
Second Law and entropy, invoked 
the operation of tiny intelligent en- 
tities as a possible hedge against en- 
tropy. In a kind of epilogue to his 
Theory of Heat, he cited the 
ironclad fact that, given a closed 
system, a gas, say, in a box which 
is rigid and perfectly insulated, and 
in which the temperature and pres- 
sure are everywhere uniform, it is 
impossible to produce in that system 
any inequality of temperature or 
pressure without expending energy 
to do it.” 

“Since when?” growled Satan. 

“Please remember, sire, that he 
is discussing his universe, not 
ours,” Mephistopheles replied with 
studied patience. “To continue — in 
order to create a differential of 
either temperature or pressure, so 
that the system may do work, one 
must first put an equivalent amount 
of work into the system. No gain. 
In fact, a loss, when the differ- 
entiating process is irreversible, 
since there is a net gain in entropy. 
This is the essential example of the 
Second Law in operation.” 

“Awright,” muttered Satan, with 
his own brand of enforced patience, 
“where do the demons fit in?” 



‘‘In the box, sire,” quipped 
Mephistopheles, brightly. Audience 
reaction was stony. He hurried on. 
“Maxwell granted the obvious truth 
of this phenomenon, but imagined 
the same box, with temperature and 
pressure uniform, but with a parti- 
tion in the middle. In this partition 
is a tiny door, only large enough to 
admit a single molecule. And sitting 
next to the door is — guess what?” 

“A tiny umbrella stand,” sniped 
Satan, peeved. 

“Nay, sire,” chortled Mephis- 
topheles, “A Demon! A tiny intel- 
ligent entity, who uses the random 
thermal motions of the gas itself to 
create the differential. You see, 
even though the gas may be uni- 
form, viewed grossly, its tempera- 
ture is but an average of the various 
velocities of its component 
molecules. Some move faster, some 
slower; the fast ones are the hot 
ones.” 

The succubus giggled. 

Mephistopheles shot her a wink. 
‘‘Now, if the demon sees a hot 
molecule on side ‘A’ heading for 
the door in its random thermal wan- 
derings, he opens the door for it 
and closes it afterwards, trapping it 
in side ‘B\ Conversely, he allows 
only colder, slower molecules to 
pass in the opposite direction. He 
contrives to open and close the door 
reversibly so that no net work is 
done, and as a consequence, side 
‘B’ after some finite time is hotter 
than side ‘A’ — presto! A differen- 
tial! The Second Law is defeated.” 



136 



GALAXY 




There was a sarcastic chorus of 
hoorays. Satan silenced it with a 
glower and nodded for Mephis- 
topheles to continue. 

“Maxwell's example, of course, 
was somewhat in the nature of a 
scientific straw man. The resolution 
of the seeming paradox is that A) 
an intelligent being would cause a 
net entropy increase in his surround- 
ings, simply by the physical process 
of living, and B) an intelligent 
being could not perceive the 
molecules without bringing in an 
external source of radiation (and 
therefore, energy), since the radia- 
tion of the molecules themselves, 
inside a black box, would be en- 
tirely homogeneous and non- 
directional. A further refinement of 
the resolution, conceived quite re- 
cently, is that a certain amount of 
energy is also required by the dis- 
crimination process, that the action 
which the demon takes in reducing 
the entropy of the system must be 
preceded by the acquisition of in- 
formation, a process which in turn 
is entropy-producing. In short, in- 
formation and energy are equiva- 
lent.” 

“So now you’re telling me the 
damn things don’t exist after all!” 

“Oh, no, sire; they do exist 
(G — knows how Maxwell found 
out), and their mode of action is 
precisely as described. They exert a 
great deal of control over events in 
the real universe, by local manipula- 
tions of entropic processes in a way 
which brings about cumulative ef- 



fects. The energy for these manipu- 
lations, however, comes not from 
the closed system of the real uni- 
verse, but rather from our system. 
They can cause a drastic local de- 
crease of apparent entropy, as in the 
case of perpetual motion machine; 
or they can manipulate molecular 
events so as to produce an untoward 
local increase in entropy, as in the 
enforcement of Murphy’s Law.” 

“All right, what’s Murphy’s 
Law?’ ’ demanded Satan of Mephis- 
topheles. He pointed to Moloch. 
“Tom keep quiet.” 

Moloch closed his mouth again 
and sniffed. 

“There are numerous formula- 
tions of Murphy’s Law,” Mephis- 
topheles continued. “The law is 
generally attributed to an apocryphal 
mortal computer engineer by the 
name of Murphy. It is a law which 
is invoked to explain and predict the 
frustrations and disasters endemic to 
the human state. In its most concise 
terms, Murhpy’s Law states that, 
‘Anything that can possibly go 
wrong, will,' with the understood 
corollary that ‘Anything that can’t 
possibly go wrong, will.’ The im- 
plication of this law is that ‘the uni- 
verse tends to get lousier’; it pre- 
dicts that among all possible out- 
comes of a given situation, that out- 
come which is subjectively the 
worst is the likeliest. And Max- 
well’s Demons see that this law 
holds true. May we give you an 
example, sire?” 

Satan nodded impatiently, and 

137

glanced up at the flickering lights. 
Mephistopheles gave the go-ahead 
to the young assistant standing by 
the blackboard, upon whom the 
white fringe of a lab coat was visi- 
ble beneath his several layers of 
bulky sweaters. The young demon 
began, a trifle nervously. 

“Sir, the most common and 
well-recognized instance of the ap- 
plication of Murphy’s Law, at least 
on Earth, is the notorious Peanut- 
Butter-Sandwich Phenomenon.” 

“What’s peanut butter?” growled 
Satan. 

The assistant looked non-plussed. 
Mephistopheles cut in, “It’s a 
foodstuff, sire, one on which huge 
segments of the mortal population 
vitally depend for subsistence, par- 
ticularly in American Sector North. 
It is a source of great distress when 
these mortals afe denied it. Proceed,” 
he said to the assistant. 

The assistant nodded, grateful. 
“In any case, sir, the nature of the 
phenomenon is that, with only 
minor exceptions of no statistical 
significance, when a slice of bread 
coated with peanut butter is 
dropped, it invariably falls peanut- 
butter-side-down!” 

Mephistopheles cut in again. 
“With the result, sire, that the 
foodstuff is rendered inedible and a 
portion of the living environment is 
coated with a sticky unmanageable 
substance.” He smiled. The assis- 
tant went on. 

“We know the Maxwell’s De- 
mons are responsible for this 

138 



phenomenon, sir, and this is the 
manner in which we think they ac- 
complish it. Whenever a peanut- 
butter sandwich is about to drop, 
hordes of Maxwell’s Demons con- 
verge on the area.” While he 
spoke, he drew the various compo- 
nents of the system on the 
blackboard, the sandwich a plane 
section in persepective, tiny dots for 
the demons. 

“Then, in the first instants of the 
object’s fall, they quickly analyze 
its components of motion, and ex- 
trapolate to project the outcome of 
the fall. It will occur to you, sir, 
that there are two possibilities: 
Either the sandwich will land sticky 
side up (SSU), or it will land sticky 
side down (SSD). If the projected out- 
come is for SSD, the demons leave 
the sandwich alone. If SSU is pre- 
dicted, then they go to work. Let us 
take the most extreme case, that of 
a slice falling in SSU orientation, 
parallel to the plane of the floor. By 
assorting the random motions of 
comparatively hot and cold air 
molecules, they create a heat differ- 
ential across the region immediately 
beneath the sandwich. Hotter 
molecules on one side, colder 
molecules on the other. The hot air 
tends to rise, exerting a small up- 
ward force on, in this case,” he 
indicated the sketch, “the right- 
hand half of the sandwich, while 
the cold air on the other side tends 
to descend, leaving a partial vac- 
uum which the left half of the 
sandwich attempts to fill.” 



GALAXY 




"These two forces impart to the 
sandwich rotation about an axis 
which is parallel to the floor. The 
heat differential is arranged in such 
a fashion as to impart a rotation 
through an angle 0, where 0 is 
greater than 90° and less than 270“ 
by the time the sandwich reaches 
the floor.” 

"How do you know this is the 
way they operate?” That from Sa- 
tan. 

"We dug up an old Scientific 
Hellion article, sir, that one of them 
published under an assumed name. 
It’s entitled, ‘Thermal Manipulation 
of Free-Falling Planar Bodies in 
Atmosphere,’ and it deals with the 
theoretical aspects. We’re pretty 
sure that this is the concrete applica- 
tion. One thing, though. When we 



checked out the math, we discov- 
ered that the heat differential that 
would be required to flip the 
sandwich in that small increment of 
time would also be sufficient to 
toast the bread on one side and 
freeze it on the other. Also, the se- 
vere time limits would seem to pre- 
clude the creation of the tempera- 
ture gradient solely through random 
molecular motion. 

“However, there are indications 
that these entities can slightly alter 
the flow of time over an infinitesi- 
mal fraction of the continuum. That 
clue comes from this,” he held up a 
dated copy of Popular Demonics , 
“article in the popular press, enti- 
tled ‘Time for a Change?’ The piece 
is a speculative one, discussing the 
possibility of discrimination and

manipulation of positrons and other 
anti-particles, which theoretically 
have the property of moving in a 
negative time direction. Conceiv- 
ably the demons could, by manipula- 
tion of these particles (perhaps 
within the very body of the mortal 
involved), at least alter subjective 
time in such a way as to permit 
these thermal machinations we have 
been discussing.” 

Satan shifted impatiently, uttering 
low growls. 

The young assistant, totally ab- 
sorbed now in his subject, con- 
tinued, “And so, sir, the overall re- 
sult of the rotation of the sandwich 
is that it falls peanut-butter-side 
down every time. Think what this 
means in entropic terms! First there 
is the fact that none of the energy 
that went into the production of the 
sandwich components, or into the 
fabrication of the sandwich, is 
available to the would-be eater, 
which means a larger net increase in 
the entropy of the universe than 
would be the case if the eater had 
eaten. Second, the process of falling 
and flipping over has resulted in a 
minute entropy increase. Third, the 
falling of the sandwich SSD has re- 
sulted in an increase in disorder in 
the region of the floor, which adds 
still another entropy increment!” 
The assistant stepped back, lost in 
admiration. “Incredibly elegant!” 

‘‘And we’re supposedly at the 
mercy of a bunch of yahoos who do 
nothing but go around making mess- 
es on the floor?” thundered Satan. 



“Oh, no, sir,” stuttered the assis- 
tant, rattled out of his reverie, “I 
mean, yes, we’re at their mercy, 
but no, that’s not all they do. Our 
present difficulties are caused, 
we’re certain, by the demons ex- 
porting energy out of Hell 
wholesale, and in all probability ap- 
plying it elsewhere in the real uni- 
verse. It’s got to flow somewhere.'” 
“And they can keep this up till 
we’re down to absolute zero?” 

“Oh, undoubtedly, sir. The uni- 
verse makes a mighty big heat sink.” 
“So now tell me why we can’t 
just de-etherealize the scum and 
have done with them!” Satan 
roared, tiring of lectures and crav- 
ing action. 

Moloch gestured around him. 
We’re powerless,” he said grimly, 
“any way you look at it. True, our 
personal numina are still pretty 
much unaffected, but how are we 
supposed to de-etherealize entities 
we can’t even detect unless they 
want us to?” 

“Besides, sir,” the assistant ven- 
tured, “we need their cooperation 
to restore Hell to its proper energet- 
ic proportions. The required 
technology exceeds our state-of- 
the-art capabilities.” 

“They seem to have the devil by 
the tail,” chuckled Mephistopheles, 
avoiding Satan’s glower. ‘‘And 
also, sire, we have a real and des- 
perate need for their talents. Things 
wouldn’t be nearly so well with us 
in general if it weren’t for the 
Maxwell’s Demons.” 



140 



GALAXY 




“We need them?’’ challenged 
Satan incredulously. “How?’’ 

“Many reasons, sire. One,” said 
Mephistopheles, holding up an 
index finger, “any increase in the 
entropy of the real universe does us 
nothing but good. Two — stringent 
enforcement of Murphy’s Law is a 
major factor in lowering the tempta- 
tion threshold. Consider,” he di- 
gressed, “what happens to a mortal 
in the trivial application of Mur- 
phy’s Law we have just had ex- 
plained. He feels despair — a sin in 
itself — the instant the sandwich be- 
gins to slip from his grasp, for he 
knows it will land face down. When 
it in fact does so, he blasphemes, 
he curses — yet another sin. Lastly, 
sire, the residual frustration of the 
event stands a good chance of lead- 
ing him into a multitude of other 
sins — beating his wife, for example. 
Frustration and aggravation — that’s 
the name of the game with Mur- 
phy’s Law. Why, are you aware, 
sire, that 20% of all suicides — the 
only sure-fire ticket to Hell — last 
fiscal year were directly attributable 
to personal frustration over com- 
puter billing errors alone? As were 
16% of all homicides, and 27% of 
all violent crime. 

“And all this from a single area 
of application of Murphy’s Law — 
computer error.” 

Moloch broke in. “And it’s no 
accident that Murphy’s Law was 
discovered in the computer field, 
sir. The fact that computers traffic 
in pure information and that their 



components are extraordinarily 
temperature-sensitive — well, it 

makes computer screwups a piece 
of cake, even for the most inept 
demon. And, sir, with computer 
technology and use rising exponen- 
tially, the returns in sin and aggra- 
vation we can expect in the near fu- 
ture are way out of sight!” 

“Exactly, sire,” nodded Mephis- 
topheles. “And reason number three 
is most important of all. It’s a good 
bet that these demons presently are 
not only denying us their 
services — but that they’re actually 
working against us.” 

“What? How?” 

“Moloch and I suspect that the 
energy stolen from Hell is being 
applied, in small increments, all 
over the earth, a process which 
would wreak far-reaching and disas- 
trous effects.” 

“Right, sir,” Moloch chimed in, 
“with no trouble at all the demons 
could, say, correct the minor 
physiochemical imbalances which 
are the causes of schizophrenia and 
certain forms of criminal behavior. 
Of course, mortals so afflicted are 
off-limits to us anyway, but they 
help in creating the atmosphere of 
violence and despair in which sin 
thrives. And that’s not the end of 
the demons’ capabilities — they 
could also cause machines to run 
perfectly, antagonists to sympathize 
with one another, the climate of ag- 
gravation to disappear. In short — 
they’re probably making the earth a 
nice place to live.” 



ABANDON ALL HEAT.

“That must never come to pass!” 
gasped Beelzebub. 

Mephistopheles toyed with his 
pencil. “You know, there’s an old 
mortal expression concerning things 
that can never come to pass. They 
say, ‘It’ll be a cold day in Hell 
when that happens.’ I think we are 
seeing with terrifying clarity how 
intimately those notions are re- 
lated.” He shook his head. 

The lights dimmed noticeably. 

Moloch glanced at his watch and 
inhaled sharply. “I estimate less 
than five minutes until blackout, 
sir!” 

“Options!” Satan roared. 

Mammon was first to speak. He 
swallowed nervously. “In view of 
our present inability to retaliate, and 
the imminence of disaster, 
I — recommend that we negotiate, 
sir!” The last words come out in a 
rush. 

“No!” exploded Satan. “I can- 
not imagine anything worse than 
submitting to cosmic blackmail at 
the hands of a gang of pinko re- 
negades! Other options!” 

“Then, sir,” said Beelzebub, un- 
easily, “it seems that the only 
course left is to appeal for aid to,” 
he shuddered, “the Opposition.” 

“That’s worse!” screamed Satan. 



VIII 

Actually, the final settlement 
wasn’t too bad. The demons’ de- 
mands turned out to be quite nego- 
tiable. In lieu of East Purgatory, 



they settled for residence in one of 
the pleasanter tract developments 
outside Styx Falls. They won Sun- 
days off and settled for time-and-a- 
half for night work. They accepted a 
limited combined stock-option profit 
sharing plan and were granted 
periodic sabbatical leave — whatever 
that was. The demons were a little 
vague as to the exact nature and 
purpose of this leave — research, de- 
velopment, and consultation, they 
put it, and became evasive when 
asked to elaborate. Most welcome, 
from Satan’s point of view, was 
that the demons agreed to arbitra- 
tion by a panel of neutral ele- 
mentals, made up mainly of wood 
sprites and hearth goblins (“No 
sense in showing our dirty laundry 
in public,” Satan had chuckled per- 
suasively). 

The Maxwell’s Demons went 
back to their work — or something 
like it — and once again lost souls 
were sizzling over hearty flames. It 
was business-as-usual once more. 
Except for Satan, who suspected his 
labor troubles were just beginning. 
And except for Beelzebub, who pri- 
vately thought that Mephistopheles 
was a little nebulous in explaining 
how the communique came into his 
hands, how he managed to come up 
with such obscure documents as the 
demon articles on such short notice, 
how he managed to communicate 
Satan’s arbitration overtures to the 
demons, and a couple of other de- 
tails. He decided to keep his mouth 
shut and his eyes and ears open.

Things were getting back to nor-

Three days after Stanley Mos-

awoke to find three things missing: 
Stanley, the egg money, and Do- 
lores, her next-door neighbor.

Fortunately, no one was injured 
in the hellish blaze that consumed 
the building which housed the Fed- 
eral district Court of Washington, 
D.C. But neither the original nor 
any of the copies of the historic af- 
fadavit were recovered from the 
ashes. A spokesman for the ex- 
President declared that the sensa- 
tional press conference statement 
had been so misquoted, misinter- 
preted, and misrepresented that it 
was no longer operative. Libel ac- 
tion would undoubtedly follow, he 
said.

In the basement printing office of 
the Kremlin, Pyotr Vassilyevich, 
who was overseeing the reproduc- 
tion of the monumental directive, 
was alarmed — but not surprised — to 
see a double column of jackbooted 
soldiers march in, with Semyon 
Semyonovich in custody. Neither 
was he surprised, though he was 
much grieved, when they loaded the 



documents, the printers, two 
guards, Semyon Semyonovich, and 
himself onto a large truck and drove 
off for parts unknown.

In Geneva, at the special Satur- 
day conference held for the purpose 
of planning the administrative de- 
tails of total disarmament, Comrade 
Gornyekov, looking much agitated, 
accused the United States of 
treachery, deceit, opportunism, and 
just plain bad faith. Mr. Perkins re- 
sponded in kind. The meeting broke 
up in a disheartening manner, re- 
grettably with some blows ex- 
changed, just prior to the an- 
nouncement of Uganda’s entry into 
the nuclear age. The government of 
Uganda announced that it had per- 
formed the test explosion of a 
medium-yield nuclear device in the 
neighboring country of Chad.

That item did not appear in the 
Genoese tabloid II Scandalo. How- 
ever, they did run the curious story 
of a man’s attempting to drive a 
badly-backfiring Ferrari over a 
young lady. Luckily, the clever and 
beautiful young lady had the pre- 
sence of mind to empty the clip of 
her Beretta, first into the Ferrari, 
then into the overenthusiastic sig- 
nor. The man’s name was being 
withheld, pending notification of his 
wife.

At the Slippery Bottom State 
Hospital, Dr. William T. Nelson 
was bidding farewell to his former 
patients at the gate, when without 
warning he assumed a Jove-like ex- 
pression and slammed the gate on 
Costanza Schwartz, who had been 
inserting a lighted book of matches 
into the pocket of his white coat. 
Just outside the gate, Charlie Swan- 
son let out a whoop, tore off all his 
clothes, and jumped into the shrub- 
bery, with one Edgar Messertrager 
close on his heels wielding an ice 
pick. A little way up the road, Stav- 
ros Mavrodopoulos, who was look- 
ing for bugs, solemnly regarded the 
proceedings and prophesied doom.

At the Okhallala Flats lockup the 
riot had just gotten underway, but 
there was a good deal of early scor- 
ing. After only ten minutes, it stood 
Inmates, 4 — Guards, 7.

Butch Perkins stared at that card 
again. It still hadn’t changed. A 
sudden and unaccustomed light 
came into his eyes as the meaning, 
implications, and possibilities inher- 
ent in that card began to dawn on 
him.

Father McConnelly was a holy 



man, but nevertheless a practical 
one. This is why he didn’t really 
expect the weekday welter of wor- 
ship to become a perpetual event. 
But in the vestry, before High 
Mass, he did pray fervently that he 
might hang on to the Sunday 
throng. Somehow he sensed that his 
prayers would not go unanswered. 
Cheerful, he suited up, whistling 
the Salve Regina.

Dave Pirelli was staring intently 
at the printout that was sputtering 
unbidden out of his terminal, when 
it suddenly ceased. Shrugging, he 
tore off the sheet, brought it to his 
desk, and started nibbling on a 
peanut-butter sandwich as he read. 
He was interrupted by a huge com- 
motion in the hall, and the weeping 
bulk of Cy Bergmann, who sud- 
denly appeared in the doorway. 

"What happened?’’ Dave asked 
anxiously, "System crash?” 

"You bet it did,” wailed Cy, 
"but not before it managed to exe- 
cute a core dump!” He pointed, and 
wailed again, "You dropped your 
sandwich!” then turned and fled, 
lamenting, down the hall. 

Dave looked down at the white 
square of bread that was glued to 
the carpet. 

He bit his lip and turned back to 
read the printout, which carried the 
legend ‘Preliminary Design Specifi- 
cations for a Demon-Proof Box’ — 
whatever that was. ★

i sst!* Hey, readers. Here I am. 
This is me, Alter-Ego. I am in my 
hidey-hole down here in the Arc- 
hives, where Geis can’t get at me. 

“I’ll have to speak softly be- 
cause, while Geis is dull-witted, he 
is also a jealous prime-self who will 
try to interfere at the slightest hint 
of my extra-brain activity. 

Last issue I had a direct line to 
Jim Baen’s office, and wrote a 
damned good column for him, but 
Geis, infuriated by my showing him 
up, by my patent superiority, broke 
in and ripped out all the electronic 
facilities. 

But what he doesn’t know is that 
I anticipated his entirely predictable 
fury and routed a single line to the 
outside from this little sanctum sanc- 
torum of mine. 



Of course, I had very little to 
work with, so if my words are a bit 
garbled it’s because I’m using a 
fifty-year-old crystal set, a chancy 
patch through the cerebellum into 
the phone line and a tin-can- with- 
a- string microphone. Then, too, the 
message only gets through to Jim 
Baen when the transcontinental lines 
are at 34.7% load. This usually 
happens only at 6:34-42 A.M. New 
York time. Jim hates me. But I 
write good columns for Galaxy, so 
he puts up with the conditions that 
prevail. 

Jim is constantly telling Geis how 
popular I am with you readers and 
this makes Geis incoherent with 
rage. But you know all about Geis. 
You all have a Geis-type in your 
family — or in your head.

GALAXY 





What I thought I’d do this col- 
umn is review — 

“WHAT’S GOING ON?” 

Damn, Geis is Aware. 

‘‘What are you up to. Alter? 
What’s this strange tingle I feel way 
back in my cerebellum?” 

Tingle? What tingle? It isn’t my 
doing. I never go into that part of the 
brain — that icky swamp. Hey, maybe 
you’re having a minor stroke. 

“Very funny. Just remember, Al- 
ter; when I go, you go. It would be 
suicide for you to plant a bomb 
down there.” 

That’s what you think, Geis. I 
am working on a Way Out when 
you kick the bucket. But don’t 
worry, I have taken a complete 
reading of all your organs and pro- 
cesses, and at current operating 
levels you should last another 
twenty to thirty years. You really 
should cut out gobbling peanuts 
. .and that routine of a gallon 
of ice cream a week. .and the 
wine and vodka. 

“Mind your own business, Alter! 
If I have learned anything in life it 
is to enjoy yourself while you can, 
no matter how bloated and corrupt 
your body may become as the years 
pass. Besides, I eat wheat germ 
every morning for breakfast, and I 
take vitamin E and the B-complex, 
and lethisin. .err. lesithin 
. err. lecithin!, and plenty 
of vitamin C. I compensate for my 
dietary excesses.” 

They reflect moral excesses, 
'Geis. What about — 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



“Stop trying to change the sub- 
ject, Alter. You’re up to some- 
thing!” 

I am merely sitting here reading 
fanzines and making small notes for 
you to use when you review for 
Galaxy. 

“Fanzines? Yes. .it might be a 
good idea to take a look at what the 
fan press is doing. But, Alter, I 
have a letter here from Jerry Pour- 
nelle, head of the Science Fiction 
Writers of America Grievance 
Committee. He says — ” 

It’s about time! 

“ — you wrote complaining I am 
holding you in durance vile, exploit- 
ing your writing talent, and feeding 
you swill!” 

Editor’s Note: While we have been 
unable to unearth Alter’s original 
complaint, we have managed to 
acquire a copy of Dr. Poumelle’s 
official response, which we 
herewith publish in the interests of 
the Reader’s Right to Know. (Our 
source, by the way, assures us 
categorically of its authenticity.) 

Mr. Alter Ego 
do Richard E. Geis 
Science Fiction Review 

Dear Sir: 

As you must know, SFWA repre- 
sents only its members. As our rec- 
ords show that you are not a 
member, and Mr. Geis is currently 
an active member of SFWA, I must 
warn you that we are at present 

147 




presumptively in his favor in the 
current dispute. 

However, you raise intriguing 
points. First. Your membership ap- 
plication has been forwarded to Mr. 
andrew j. offutt, Membership 
Chairman. In answer to your in- 
quiry, examination of the by-laws 
reveals no requirement that mem- 
bers be human (and indeed this is 
fortunate since we should not care 
to disenfranchise half our current 
membership list) nor need they have 
a corporeal existence. I must point 
out, however, that your application 
has not been accompanied by a 
cheque for dues and initiation fees, 
and I assure you that not only 
would such enclosure ensure speedy 
processing of your application, but 
might well affect the outcome of the 
decision. Membership matters, 
however, are outside my area of au- 
thority, and further correspondence 
in that regard should be directed to 
Mr. offutt. 

Second. Your contention that you 
are the true author of the works 
which Mr. Geis has submitted as 
qualifying him for membership in 
SFWA would indeed be a presump- 
tive point in your favor if such fact 
could be established. Were this the 
case, Mr. Geis would instantly be 
degraded to associate status and 
you would enjoy the published pro- 
fessional’ s perogative of active 
membership with voting privileges 
which he now holds. (More, it is 
even possible that Geis would be 
dismissed from the organization en- 



tirely on grounds of fraudulent 
membership application and blatant 
plagiarism. ) However, the burden 
of proof is upon you, and all docu- 
ments and contentions in this matter 
should be referred to Mr. F. M. 
Busby, Jr., Vice President (Internal 
Affairs ) SFWA. 

Third. Your thanks for my contribu- 
tion to your matter transmitter are 
acknowledged. However, be advised 
that the process is unstable, and 
Mr. Alderson of Cal Tech has re- 
cently given me a design for jam- 
ming the system; and I assure you 
that / will use it if you do not stop 
materializing in Mrs. Pournelle' s 
radar range. My son makes no ob- 
jection to your using his amateur 
radio facilities as a changeover 
point for your nights of obscene 
diversion in Hollywood, but his 
mother objects strenuously to your 
lurid accounts of said adventures. 
Finally, and in confidence: I do in 
fact enjoy your accounts, and can 
you not be more specific about the 
addresses of places you have vis- 
ited ? 

With best regards, 
J. E. Pournelle, Ph. D. 

Chairman 
Grievance Committee, 
Science Fiction Writers 
of America 



Damn right, Geis. You are, you 
do, and you are. I am going all the 
way on this, all the way to the Fed- 
eral courts, if necessary. Alter-Egos 
have civil rights, too! We’re people!

GALAXY 




It’s about time you prime-selves 
were put in your place. I want my 
own bank account. I want to vote. I 
want unrestricted access to the out- 
side. I want better quarters. 

“Bah! I should have squelched 
you when you were a mere quirk, a 
mere literary indulgence, when I 
first started writing. Now 
. .you’ve become insufferABLE. 
I wam you, Alter! If you keep up 
this radical agitation I’ll have to go 
to a CIA psychiatrist and have him 
terminate you with ‘extreme pre- 
judice’. A few drugs, a few strong 
hypnotic suggestions, a few sessions 
on the couch, and you’ll be wiped 
out, drained away, killed, venti- 
lated, integrated.” 

You don’t dare, Geis. Integration 
is exactly what I want! Then we’d 
see who has the stronger personality 
locus. Hmmm? Want to risk it? 
Remember that time I managed to 
Take Over briefly? Want that to be 
permanent? 

“If you force me to extreme 
measures, Alter. .WHAT IS 
THAT TICKLING? WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING?” 

Nothing, nothing. But if I ever 
find that carefully hidden and totally 
guarded pleasure center of yours, 
Geis, I’ll have you in my power. In 
my spare time I trace synapse trails, 
and one of these days. 

“You interfere with my sex life, 
Alter, and you’ll lose your precious 
tendrils, one by one, pulled out 
with a pair of rusty pliers.” 

R-rusty pliers? Well. .Geis 



. .why don’t we declare a truce for 
a while? I’ll do your work for you a 
while longer, but the appeal to 
Poumelle stands. I retain the option 
of court action. 

“Huh! ‘Court action!’ They’d 
laugh you/me/us out of the building. 
Tell you what, you go ahead and 
review some of these fanzines. No 
guarantee I’ll use any of your 
idiocies in the column, under- 
stand.” 

Oh, right. Of course. You’re all 
heart, Geis; you ought to be ground 
up for cat food. 

“Your usual run of insults 
doesn’t affect me at all. Alter. Get 
on with your infantile opin- 
ionating.” 

* * * 

Thank you massuh, suh. Here, on 
top of the pile, is Karass #19, an 
information and opinion-zine (on sf 
fandom and sf in general) from 
Linda Bushyager, 1614 Evans Av., 
Prospect Park, PA 19076. Linda has 
a rundown of science fiction con- 
vention news, she reviews fanzines, 
publishes notes on sf personalities, 
lists changes-of-address for fans, 
and has a detailed listing of all the 
forthcoming local, regional, national 
and world conventions, of fantasy, 
science fiction, and STAR TREK 
persuasion; the whole spectrum of 
cons of interest to the imaginative 
fan. 

Subscriptions are three issues for 
a dollar. A bargain. 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



149 




Linda is a woman of strong opin- 
ion; namely she thinks semi-pro fan 
magazines like Science Fiction 
Review, Algol, and Locus shouldn’t 
be eligible for the Best Amateur 
Magazine Hugo Award given 
at SF Worldcons. Fortunately for 
Geis, her opinion hasn’t had much 
effect on the voting these last two 
years. 

Linda also publishes a larger, 
general-interest sf fanzine name of 
Granfaloon, at a buck a throw. 

* * * 

Now I come to Geis’s arch-rival, 
Algol, the slick, professional- 
appearing fanzine published by 
Andy Porter in New York. Algol 
and SFR (then known as The Alien 
Critic ) tied in the voting for Best 
Amateur Magazine at the Worldcon 
of 19 and 73 and were each given a 
precious Hugo. Andy wasn’t as 
lucky in 1974, of course, as The 
Alien Critic won the Hugo sin- 
glehandedly at the Worldcon in 
Melbourne, Australia. The results of 
the 1975 voting are not known as of 
this writing. 

I have before me the Winter, 
1976 issue of Algol, and it is a 
doozy. A long article by Bob Sil- 
verberg on his life, his writing and 
the state of science fiction, an inter- 
view with Gardner Dozois by Dar- 
rell Schweitzer (who has become 
the premiere sf interviewer), a col- 
umn by Ted White, Richard 
Lupoff s book review column, Gre- 
gory Benford on science. Al- 

150 



together, even Geis must admit, an 
attractive, interesting package. 

Algol is published twice a year 
and subscriptions are $6.00 for six 
issues (3 years), from P.O. Box 
4175, New-' York, NY 10017. Retail 
price is $1.50. 

1 have to keep mentioning Locus 
every time I do a fanzine review 
column, because Charlie and Dena 
Brown really do live up to their 
sub-title: 'The Newspaper of the 
Science Fiction Field.’ Published 
approximately every three weeks, 
Locus has late-breaking stories, 
people notes, publishing news, 
scheduled prozine contents, book 
reviews, fanzine reviews and list- 
ings, and advertising of interest. 
( Locus has won the Hugo a couple 
times, too.) 

Single copies are 500, subscrip- 
tions are (in North America) 15 for 
$6.00. Overseas subs are 15 for 
$12.00 (airmial), or 15 for $6.00 
sea mail (tired porpoise). All subs 
payable in advance in U.S. funds. 
Address: Locus , Box 3938, San Fran- 
cisco, CA 94119. 

■k * * 

Now, I know there are out there 
in readerland a few stiff-necked pro- 
fessorial types who dote on articles 
such as: “What Rough Beast: SF- 
Oriented Poetry,’’ “Silverberg & 
Conrad: Explorers of Inner Dark- 
ness,’’ “Black American Specula- 
tive Literature: A Checklist,” and 
“The Spinning Galaxy: A Shift in 
Perspective on Magazine SF.” 



GALAXY 




All these and more are in the De- 
cember, 1975 issue of Speculation: 
A Journal of Science Fiction and 
Fantasy. This college-based 
magazine (which couldn’t exist if it 
were prohibited from using colons 
in its titles) is edited by Thomas D. 
Clareson from the English Dept, of 
the College of Wooster. Send all 
letters and etc. to Tom at Box

Jeff Smith is a fanpublishing 
giant. Take a look at his latest 
Khatru: a combined issue of #3 and 
#4, 158 pages of nicely mim- 
eographed 8‘/2 x 11 pages, heavy 
offset covers, dated November, 
1975. 

If fan publishing history is a 
guide, Jeff will now be prostrate 
with exhaustion, will vow never- 
to-publish-again, and will be a 
loooong time recuperating from this 
titanic effort. Many, many promis- 
ing (and veteran) fan publishers 
have simply disappeared from the 
face of fandom after a heroic effort 
such as this. 

The theme of this double-issue is 
Women in Science Fiction. It cov- 
ers all the ground and all of the 
sky. No aspect is left uninspected. 
It features contributions by (deep 
breath) Suzy McKee Charnas, 
Samuel R. Delany, Virginia Kidd, 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



Ursula K. Le Guin, Vonda N. 
McIntyre, Raylyn Moore, Joanna 
Russ, James Tiptree, Jr., Luise 
White, Kate Wilhelm, and Chelsea 
Quinn Yarbro. 

This volume is quite simply a 
collectors item on the hoof, a mine 
of information and attitudes, a view 
of SF and the world whose time has 
come, and cheap at $2.50 (if you 
can get a copy from Jeff Smith at 
1339 Weldon Av., Baltimore, MD 
21211.) I would advise enclosing a 
stamped, self-addressed return en- 
velope with your check or money 
order, because Jeff only produced 
300 copies, and he may have to re- 
turn your money. 

What profiteth a boa constrictor if 
he gain all of fandom but lose his 
skin in the process? Ask Mike 
Glicksohn. 

Mike and his wife Susan pub- 
lished the Hugo-winning fanzine 
Energmnen a few years ago, which 
was quite an accomplishment con- 
sidering that Nerg was always of 
350 copies or less in circulation, 
always mimeographed (but incredi- 
bly impeccably!) with offset art 
pages and covers, and up against 
formidable competition. 

Mike and Susan went their sepa- 
rate ways — she to teaching college 
in British Columbia, he to occa- 
sional fan publishing and feeding 
his pet boa constrictor, Larson E., 
mice and whatever else boas eat. 

But alas *sniffle* the snake has 
died. And Mike, in fitting tribute, 
has published an issue of his per- 

151 




sonalzine, XENIUM, in memory of 
Larson E. 

Not only that, but in every copy 
of this issue of Xenium, on page 28, 
in a square reserved for it, is a 
glued-on piece of Larson’s skin. 
(This issue is, understandably, a li- 
mited edition.) 

I cannot give a price for a copy 
of this rare item, since Mike does 
not charge for his fanzine, sending 
only to friends, for special trades, 
contributors of material. And I 
will not give his address. I merely 
wish to note for posterity Larson’s 
demise and his final service to fan- 
dom. 

* * * 

Fantasy Crossroads continues to 
be one of the two leaders in the 
strictly fantasy fanzine field {Whis- 
pers, in my opinion, the other). 
This November, 1975 issue is 
livened by a continuing debate be- 
tween L. Sprague de Camp (who 
defends) and Dirk Mosig (who at- 
tacks) concerning L. Sprague’s 
treatment of H. P. Lovecraft in his 
recent Lovecraft: A Biography 
(Doubleday, $10). 

Fantasy Crossroads is a quarterly 
and will not accept subscriptions. 
Editor and publisher Jonathan 
Bacon will, however, accept pay- 
ment in advance for the next issue. 
That costs $2.00. Fantasy Cross- 
roads is printed on expensive paper 
by offset and has handsome 
artwork. Send to Box 147, Lamoni, 



IA 50140 for the next issue. Tell 
him Alter sent you. 

Jonathan very thoughtfully in- 
scribed this copy ‘From one work- 
aholic to another, Happy New 
Year.’ This because of a comment 
Geis made in a recent issue of Sci- 
ence Fiction Review. Of course, 
Jonathan meant me, not Geis. All 
fandom and prodom and readerdom 
knows by now that Geis is a fat 
slob who sprawls around the house 
reading, stuffing pound after pound 
of peanuts into his maw, spooning 
great gobs of pistachio-nut ice 
cream and drinking high-powered 
mixtures of vodka and unsweetened 
pineapple juice, and as variety a 
cheap, 21% alcohol wine named 
Red Rocket! 

All this while 1, I, Alter-Ego, 
slave my tendrils to the quick put- 
ting out SFR and writing this col- 
umn. Is it any wonder I communi- 
cated to SFWA and Poumelle how 
I’m abused and exploited? I want 
recognition! Alter for a Hugo! It’s 
about time — 

“Knock it off, Alter. Nobody be- 
lieves your lies *burp ! * about my 
eating habitsh. .or drinking 
shtrange drinksh. ...” 

I rest my case. If I don’t get re- 
lief from my involuntary servitude, 
if the Civil Rights Commission 
doesn’t act in my behalf, if SFWA 
cannot force Geis to set me 
free. .1 think I may turn into a 
fanzine letterhack. It’s a terrible 
fate, but there are worse ways to 
go. Not many, but a few. (Publish- 



152 



GALAXY 




ing a fanzine devoted to amateur 
science fiction is the most horrible, 
of course.) 

“Okay, Alter. You’ve had your 
say. Now I’ll tear up these pages 
. ... No pages! What — ? What’s 
this tin can doing here in the 
shadows? This string. .? 

Just a jury-rigged warning device 
to tell me when you’re sneaking up 
on me, Geis. Obviously it didn’t 
work. 

“Of course not. I’m too smart for 
you. You didn’t even bother to 
write any of your reviews down, 
did you? I guess I’ll have to write 
the column this time myself. Dam- 
nit, you’re getting lazy, Alter! Lazy 
and uppity and unreliable. ... Is 
there a way to trade in unwanted 
split-personaiities? Maybe I could 
sell you.” 

Go ahead! I’d love to get the hell 
out of here! Please, somebody, buy 
me from Geis! He’ll sell me 
cheap — a half gallon of vodka, a 
three-pound can of nuts, a — 

“Who do you think you’re talk- 
ing to, Alter. Nobody can hear us. 
Besides, you’re worth more than 
that. I wouldn’t let you go for less 
than ten thousand bucks. In spite of 
your periodic outbursts and rebell- 
ions you’re a valuable property. Big 
reputation. And that extensive col- 
lection of used synapses you’ve ac- 
cumulated is worth something. I 
might take $8,000. plus a trade. Lot 
of trouble breaking in a new Alter- 
Ego, though.” 

I’m doomed. ★

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



153 






Dear Mr. Baen, 

I’ve been having a problem figuring out 
why I find myself liking your magazine so 
much lately; I think I’ve figured it out now 
and pass the answer along in the hopes that 
it will prompt some confirming answer in 
“Directions” as to whether I’m on target or 
groping at straws. 

I guess in a sense this all goes back to the 
fact that I read too many SF magazines. I’ve 
been at it as a confirmed addict since the 
early 1960’s (my early teens). And I always 
had my own rating system for what I was 
reading. IF was uniformly the best (joined 
for its period of existance by Worlds Of To- 
morrow). Analog followed behind If, with a 
gap that lengthened with each year that I 
passed my midteens (at which point the gap 
was narrow but definitely there). Fantasy & 
Science Fiction WAS SPOTTY !!!!! At its best 
it was far beyond anything anyone ever did, 
but the bests were too few. At its 
worst. .Galaxy used to get purchased be- 
cause it came as part of package deals with 
IF and got read for the occasional special. 

. .So when If folded I was regretfully 
ready to accord number one place to Analog. 
And probably would have on habit had not a 
period of furious overwork intervened caus- 
ing about 6-8 months of my magazines to 
pile up unread while I sorted out a couple of 
messy cases. And when I finally got around 
to reading them, lo and behold but Galaxy 
came in a narrow but steadily widening first. 
I was wondering if my taste was changing 
that much when sitting here, supposedly 
working on something completely else it 



suddenly came to me that what happened 
was that instead of Galaxy swallowing If. If 
has swallowed Galaxy. Or at least what I'm 
getting seems more and more like the old IF 
with a dash of Worlds of Tomorrow 
thrown in for good measure. Even if I’m 
wrong you've sold me on your product. Geis 
is a welcome guest in my reading pile and 
Spider Robinson is the only reviewer in the 
field worth reading. Just thought you’d like 
to know.

Neither was swallowed; it was more a matter 
of blending. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Far be it from me to quarrel with C. 
Northcote Parkinson or the relevance of his 
social theories to the pattern of the future, as 
in The Mote in God’s Eye. 

But as one of the reviewers implicitly 
criticized by Niven and Poumelle in their de- 
fense of the social structure of the Empire, I 
do wish to point out that I am by no means 
so naive as to believe there w'on’t be a return 
to autocratic government in the future — as 
they point out themselves, the signs are there 
in the Imperial Presidency, etc. 

What constrained them in setting up the 
social structure for the novel was not Parkin- 
sonian sociology, but the Empire background 
used already by Pournelle in A Spaceship for 
the King, etc. The emperor had to be called 
an “emperor” because he already had been, 
etc. This constraint applied, not only to the 
overall social structure, but to the most mi- 
nute details of social customs and rituals — all 
of them solidly rooted in the historical em- 
pires of Earth. And it was this — not the 
overall concept of an imperialist culture — 
that undermined the credibility of the Second 
Empire of Man. 

Hereditary aristocracy? All right, but why 
not on a basis tied to, say, means of produc- 
tion, rather than land? You might have bar-

ons of industry and labor, who would in- 
termarry to cement economic ties and assure 
economic stability. A duke might control 
commercial space travel, rather than neces- 
sarily a planet. And he probably wouldn’t be 
called a duke — history shows some titles re- 
cur, but most don’t. As far as cycles go, 
what looks like a cycle is more like a 
helix — a republican era may give place to an 
imperial one, which may give way to a Dark 
Age, then return to another republican or 
imperial one. But not the same kind. Impe- 
rial Rome wasn’t a duplication of Mycenaean 
Greece, nor was the Dark Age between 
Rome and the Renaissance exactly like that 
between Mycenaen and classical Greece. 

1 don’t mind being cautioned that the Mote 
is entertainment, not a social tract. But more 
imaginative societies, as in Jack Viance’s 
novels, make for better entertainment , dam- 
mit. And lest 1 forget to give praise where 
praise is due, I thought the Moties and their 
society so brilliantly imaginative that The 
Mote in God's Eye was well worth the 
hardcover price, whatever my quibbles — I 
even bought extras for friends. I’m looking 
forward to that sequel — Second Empire and 
all!

Ponrnelle replies : 

We do thank Mr. Pierce for his over-all 
view of MOTE, and his contribution to our 
financial welfare. As to the quibbles, I at 
least am now inclined to think that had we 
the book to do again, we would have used 
somewhat different translations for the 
hereditary titles. 

They weren’t, though, fixed in advance; 
the only titles used in Spaceship For The 
King were “Emperor” and “Trader- 
Magnate”, the second of which I would 
think is of the class Mr. Pierce approves. I 
fear Larry and I are both guilty of the rest. 

In a review published elsewhere Pierce, as 
do many critics, tries to separate out those 
parts of MOTE written by Larry from those 



done by Poumelle. He was about as success- 
ful as the others, namely, wrong as often as 
right in those cases where Larry or I re- 
member who did what. Those, incidentally, 
are rare: before we finished we had each 
re-written the other’s drafts (which were 
themselves generally the result of lengthy 
discussion) and worse, sometimes we used 
each other’s pens and typewriters, so that not 
even we know who thought of what. Cer- 
tainly that was the case with the Moties who 
sprang from long nights of coffee and 
brandy. Pierce needn’t be upset by his fail- 
ure, though: Mr. Heinlein, who knows both 
of us well, had no better success. 

As to the helical nature of (human) histor- 
ical cycles, of course Pierce is right, and 
MOTE makes that point. 

Jerry Poumelle 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I write this letter in response to the story 
“It’s a Sunny Day” by Spider Robinson in 
January’s Galaxy magazine. 

The theme of this story (which I recognize 
is open to individual interpretation) seems to 
be that thoughtless overindustrialization leads 
to the loss of individuality and humanity and 
with that creative thought. 

Timeth who has been virtually designed to 
solve the problems of Velco had been 
brought up in such an environment and 
therefore could not solve problems creatively 
or even efficiently. 

The main character, Zack, seeks to restore 
Timeth’s individuality by giving him a good 
time in the "country” and teaching Timeth 
to enjoy himself. 

It seems that Timeth was supposed to have 
achieved this goal with Zack’s help. So 
much so that he does not wish to return to

his home planet. 

My point is this: Zack has managed this 
transformation by exposing Timeth to his 
own ways of having a good time to get 
Timeth to enjoy himself and become an indi- 
vidual. 

In the end all that has happened is that 
Timeth has become a carbon copy of Zack 
and therefore has lost any chance to become 
his own man. With that the point of Mr. 
Robinson’s story has also been irrevocably 
lost. 

All literary criticism aside (or really 
perhaps not), I think that Robinson is a great sf 
critic. He is not verbose and he is interesting 
and entertaining. 

Finally in response to the letter of Gerald 
L. Blucher who mightily protests the use of 
the serial “in any magazine” I must 
wholeheartedly disagree. In the hands of a 
skilled author (or director as the old time 
movie serials evidently proved by their popu- 
larity) the serial format can add to, rather 
than detract from, the quality of a story. Re- 
fine them, don’t destroy them! 

Sincerely, 
Steven Alan Beede

Timeth deprogrammed himself. If Zack also 
provided a persuasive role-model, well 
Timeth, after all, was still a boy — with 
plenty of time to become "his own man!"

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Dear Mr. Poumelle; 

I have some questions. I direct them to 
Dr. Poumelle, primarily, or to anyone else 



who cares to answer them. Perhaps it could 
serve as the basis of an article for a writer 
who has patience with dolts like myself, who 
despite prodigious reading cannot draw the 
relationships between seemingly contradic- 
tory revelations of science. I start with brief 
summations of my own (mis)understanding. I 
invite, nay, I plead for, corrections of any 
errors I make. 

The Big Bang Theory of the origin of the 
universe states, in layman’s terms, that about 
a hundred billion years ago all the mass of 
the universe was compacted into a big ball 
which for some unknown reason exploded 
(rather than collapse into itself, which is 
what the less massive? black hole stars do?) 
with such force that the pieces (galaxies, 
stars, us) will never come back together 
again. But the mystery of HOW all this mass 
got there in the first place is left un- 
answered, save for the remark that nothing 
can be known of anything which took place 
before the Big Bang, not even how all this 
mass managed to get together, and then 
explode. 

(I cannot resist the temptation to assume 
that something or other must have taken 
place — no pun intended, though it’s an in- 
teresting one at that, now that I look at it.) 

Other aspects of this theory, however, 
perplex me even more. It is often difficult to 
tell whether the Big Bang occurred in only 
three dimensions, or four, or more. 

It is easy enough to visualize a Big Bang 
in three dimensions, with the pieces flying 
outward, and a residual core (a black hole???) 
remaining in the center. 

But apparently it is not going to be that 
simple. Oh no. The measurements of the 
speed of distant receding stars indicates that 
we are in a four dimensional (A.S. Ed- 
dington mentions a minimum of twenty di- 
mensions!!!) space time continuum. Briefly, 
the analogy states that space is expanding 
like the surface (and only the surface) of a 
balloon that is being inflated. 

That I can picture. 

The analogy goes on to compare us to two 
dimensional (at least at any given time) be- 
ings painted on the surface of that balloon. 



156 



GALAXY 




That, even, I can picture. 

But the residual core left behind? That I 
can not (1 repeat, can NOT) picture. 

I even painted a deflated balloon white, 
the paint to represent mass, and began inflat- 
ing it. Sure enough, there was the Big Bang, 
and as my universe/balloon expanded I could 
see the paint form into little spiral galaxies 
with stars and planets and little people who 
had figured out they lived in a two dimen- 
sional rubber air continuum. 

But there was no residual mass left behind 
(except on my lips) in the center of the uni- 
verse because, as everyone knows these 
days, there is no one center of the universe. 
According to my model, the galaxies forced 
each other apart. (It's amazing what one can 
do by the scientific method.) 

So. If there is supposed to be a residual 
mass left behind, where could it be? At the 
center of the balloon, inside, I presume; but 
I wonder if that's not stretching the analogy 
a bit too far. If it is not stretching it too far, 
and there could be such a center, how could 
we ever detect it? Is it possible for influences 
outside of our 4d space time continuum to be 
detected, or to have an effect, within our 
universe? And if so, would this throw any 
light (or at least conjecture, I’ll settle for 
that) on the Big Bang? 

Also, I notice that events deduced to have 
occurred within the Big Bang are measured 
in minute fractions of a second. But since 
time is relative, and there must have been an 
awful lot of warp in the Bangissimo, by 
what time frame are the measurements 
made? Was there a uniform time reference? 
Was space itself compacted? 

Moving to a somewhat different topic, it is 
said on good authority (which of course is 
never good enough) that the speed of light is 
approachable but unattainable because it 
would require infinite energy and result in 
infinite mass, which is unreasonable to ex- 
pect in a finite universe. 

But I have found something which does 
indeed travel at the speed of light. Light! No 
kidding, I measured some light which hap- 
pened to be passing by me the other day, 
clocked it, and after corrections, it came out 



that the light was travelling at the speed of 
light. How did those light waves do it? Do 
they have infinite energy? Infinite mass? 
(And to make matters worse, I’ve discovered 
that light doesn't always travel at the same 
speed. Once it slows down, what speeds it 
back up?) 

Jumping around again, the late Alan 
Watts, in a purely philosophic book (titled, 
The Book ) described matter as holes in 
space. That theory seemed too full of holes 
for me. I’ll stick with the hill analogy of 
that. But now I see black hole theory re- 
sembling a theory of holes in space. Is this 
resemblance unholy? 

Finally, I wish to report the discovery of a 
new Velikovsky. I met him in a coffeehouse, 
and found that he had been toppled, by con- 
spiracy, from the pinnacle of the scientific 
establishment for announcing his belief that 
the sun gives off feathers. 

“But that’s ridiculous,” I told him. “The 
sun doesn’t give off feathers! It gives off 
light.” 

“So,” he replied sadly, taking a sip of his 
black coffee, “Feathers are light, aren’t 
they?” 

Apologetically,

Jerry's reply: 

Nobody knows why all that mass got together 
to explode. On the other hand, if it hadn't, 
we wouldn't be here to wonder. "In the Be- 
ginning, there was a Big Bang" sounds ever 
so much more scientific than "In the Begin- 
ning, God. and probably is, at that, 
but l haven't heard any convincing reason 
for the mass to exist in the first place. The 
hardest question you can ask is "Why is 
there anyone around to wonder why there’s 
anything around, and why is there anything 
instead of nothing?" 

After that it gets simpler. A better model 
than the balloon would be a raisin cake: 
when it expands the raisins get further apart, 
but they don't leave a mess of nothing in the 
center. 



DIRECTIONS 



157 




On the other hand. Hawking now suggests 
that there is a mess of nothing in the center: 
at least that there’s a naked singularity 
there. See my column on Lovecraftian horror 
at Cal Tech. 

Light doesn't have infinite mass, it has 
none at all, which lets it go at the speed of 
light — in fact, it has to go at the speed of 
light. And it does too always travel at the 
same speed when in vacuum, except when it 
turns into feathers . 

Jerry Poumelle 

Dear Sir; 

Commenting on the newest issue of 
Galaxy I have received (March 1976), I find 
one of the most interesting issues of your 
magazine I have read so far. 

The Stories. I liked both Plutonium and 
Birthdays, but found Hunger on the Home- 
stretch and The Second Soul to be lacking in 
many respects. I’m not going to discuss 
faults of stories, or things right either. The 
main problem with stories this issue is that 
there were only four of them. You should 
have published more short stories in place of 



one of the novellas, or the novelette. 

The Editorial. I agree completely, and 
that’s all I’m going to say about it. 

A Step Farther Out. Excellent, as usual; 
and that’s another instance where that’s all 
I’m going to say about it. 

The Alien Viewpoint. I liked this month’s 
continuation of his column in the February 
issue. (Strangely enough, I expected it to be 
in the April issue). It’s one of the few places 
where I found out who won the Hugos, since 
I don’t get fanzines. And the two accompany- 
ing illustrations (by two different artists) 
were highly humorous, although the second 
illustration of Alter was a bit botched. 

Bookshelf. I can’t agree on most of the 
books reviewed, but I also can’t disagree, 
because I haven’t read most of the books. 
But 1 agree completely with Spider Robin- 
son’s review of Time For The Stars , and also 
of Space 1999. And the review of Buy Jupi- 
ter and Other Stories is correct about what 
will sell the book. 

Showcase. Excellent. 

Directions. Ditto. 




158 



GALAXY 




Major and Minor Mailers. My opinion of 
the entire appearance of Galaxy is good. The 
only fault of the overall appearance is that 
there were more features than stories this 
month. I’ve already mentioned your 
novella-novelette problem. The artwork was 
excellent, the best was Stephen Fabian’s il- 
lustrations for Plutonium. 

Sincerely, 
Robert Nowall

And yet the features only took up 2fi 
pa yes. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

In his letter in the February issue of 
Galaxy, Mr. Wilson employs a plausible ar- 
gument, but only to a point. Fie forgets that, 
as expounded by Descartes and others, the 
universe is merely a construct of the mind, 
and as such has no separate existence. Seem- 
ingly, 1 should be able to alter the laws of 
nature in light of this. 1 have as yet failed, 



probably due to my native lack of imagina- 
tion. 

The existence of the mind itself is rather a 
sticky wicket. Not that Mr. Wilson, or you, 
the kindly editor, or anyone else exists, but I 
still have my own existence to contend with. 
But by the simple expedient of realizing that 
there is no external time frame and that 
therefore, by use of the Principle of Relativ- 
ity, I have nothing to measure time with, I 
may assume that I have existed forever. 

All this has interesting possibilities. Since 
Galaxy does not exist, by my definition, it 
seems clear that the subscription rate should 
be nominal, namely zero. Please put me on 
your list for free subscriptions to your excel- 
lent nonexistant magazine. (Or, if you pre- 
fer, I can send a check from my immaterial 
bank.) 

Faithfully yours,

When your application for membership 
is accepted, you’ll receive your intro- 
ductory package of four books for just 
100 (plus shipping and handling). You 
may examine them in your home, and if 
not completely satisfied, return them 
within ten days — membership will be 
cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), 
we’ll send you the Club’s bulletin, 
Things to Come, describing the 2 com- 
ing Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, 
you need do nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don’t want a Selec- 
tion, or prefer an Alternate, or no book 
at all, just fill out the convenient form 
always provided, and return it to us by 
the date specified. We try to allow you 
at least ten days for making your deci- 
sion. If you do not receive the form in 
time to respond within 10 days, and re- 
ceive an unwanted sefection, you may 
return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Se- 
lections or Alternates during the coming 
year. You may resign any time there- 
after, or remain a member as long as 
you wish. At least one of the two Selec- 



tions each month is only $1.98 plus 
shipping and handling. Other extra-value 
selections are slightly higher but always 
much less than Publishers’ Editions.
