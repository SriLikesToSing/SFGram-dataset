Si^r-Spy Lets You ‘See Throu^’ 
WaDs, Fences and Locked Doors! 

Secret of Private Detectives and Industrial Spies Revealed! 



A remarkable optical device 
about half the siM of a cigar- 
ette now makes it possible for 
you to see— without being 
seen. Yotir children» for 
examplet can play in the 
‘‘privacy** of an adjoining 
room — ^unaware that you can 
see everything they do! 
Operation of the tiny device 
is silent^ almost impossible to 
detect. The eye-piece is not 
much bigger than the head of 
a pin. 

If you drilled an ordinary hole 
that si2e through a wall, fence 
or door, you could see very 
little. But Super-Spsr*8 unique 
optical principle, called ex- 
pand/* multiplies your field of 
vision over 42^ times, by 
actual test! With “X-Pand,** 
almost no detail of a room 
can escape your Super-Spy 
sight! That gives you some 
idea of Super-Spy’s powers! 
But the real surprise is the 
price: three dollars! 

Unlimited Uses: 

Super-Spy’s uses are un- 
limited. With Super-Spy, you 
can keep an eye on the kids 
while they take their naps, 
even if the door to their room 
is closed! 

With Super-Spy installed you 
can observe beyond walls in 
your home, office of factory—* 
while you remain invisible! 

Professional Uses: 

Private and hotel detectives. 
Insurance investigators. 
Undercover agents. Security 
guards.* Photographers. 

Store qwners — watch diop* 
lifting suspects. Emplo^rs— 
get eye-witness proof of loaf* 
ing or theft. Hospital staff— 
W'atch restless patients with- 
out disturbing them. House- 
wives — see a salesman or 



stranger at the door — while 
you stay safely hidden! 

You can even take pictures 
through its low-distortion lens! 

Important and IVoHtable 
What will you do with Super- 
Spy? If it*s important, in your 
home, for you to know what 
people do when they don’t 
know they’re being watched 
(and there’s no invasion of 
privacy) — get Super-Spy! 

Order spares for sudden or 
unexpected opportunities to ob- 
serve — without being observed! 

Order extras for trusted 
friends: they might be glad 
to pay you a handsome profit. 

Perfected in Germany 

Super-Spy was perfected in 
Germany. Limited quantities 
are now available to the public 



through a special division 
(Detection Appliances) of a 
reputable mail order firm. 
The parent firm’s total sales 
throughout U.S. are over

THREE BRAVE MEN 



O n the 27th of January, 1967, the 
space age had its first Ameri- 
can casualties, when a flash fire, 
fed by the pure-oxygen atmosphere 
in the capsule, killed three astro- 
nauts as they were completing the 
pre-flight tests for the first manned 
Apollo launching. 

We all knew that we could not 
conquer space for free. Even a new 
airplane usually takes a couple of 
lives in development — test pilots 
know this, and for that matter so do 
most seasoned airline passengers, 
because even civilian transports 
have bugs that sometimes are not 
detected until a planeload or two 
gets killed. (Witness the Comet, the 
Constellation, the Electra, the Boe- 
ing 727.) And space travel is not 
merely a more arduous form of fly- 
ing. It is a reach into a new dimen- 
sion, with every part of its propul- 
sion systems, life-support equip- 
ment, even telemetry and control 
brand-new and hazardous. 

Yet it was a shock, all the same, 
when these three died. 

The fact of death is nothing 
strange in this world, of course. 
Hardly a newspaper comes out with- 
out death in its headlines: for every 



astronaut who has died, a thousand 
men have given lives in battle . 
and ten thousand or more have bat- 
tered their silly brains out in high- 
way accidents. But these men died 
in a way that is unusual and almost 
unprecedented in this year of 1967: 
they died for a purpose, and they 
died without an enemy. No one in 
this world wanted them dead, and 
no one profited by the accident that 
took their lives. 

The space program will go on, of 
course. If there were no other rea- 
son, it should go on because we owe 
it to them. But there are bigger 
reasons: we (meaning the human 
race) have to conquer space because 
it is the next place to go, and we 
have to pay whatever price it costs 
to get there. 

We have been very careful with 
the lives of our astronauts, and up 
until now we have also been very 
lucky. It is certain that these three 
are only the first to die, not the 
last. But it was a worthwhile death 
for them; and while we honor them 
and mourn them for it, it is likely 
that, every now and then, we may 
envy them a little for it, too. 

— The Editor,

THE ROAD 
TO THE RIM 

by A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 

Illustrated by MORROW 



The ship was a ruin, the purser 
was preaching sedition — all in 
all, it looked like a fine trip! 



I 

H is uniform was new, too new, 
all knife-edged creases and the 
braid and buttons as yet undimmed 
by time. It sat awkwardly upon his 
chunky body, and even more awk- 
wardly his big ears protruded from 
under the cap that was set too square- 
ly upon his head. Beneath the shiny 
visor his eyes were gray (but not 
yet hard); and his face, for all its 



promise of strength, was as yet un- 
lined, had yet to lose its immature 
softness. 

He stood at the foot of the ramp 
by which the had disembarked from 
the transport that had carried him 
from the Antarctic Base to Port 
Woomera, looking across the ex- 
panse of ochre sand to the space- 
port, to the tall, silver towers that 
were the ships, interplanetary and 
interstellar, gleaming in the desert. 



8 




The westering sun was hot on his 
back, but he did not notice the dis- 
comfort. There were the ships, the 
real ships — not obsolescent puddle- 
jumpers like the decrepit cruiser in 
which he, with the other midship- 
men of his class, had made the train- 
ing cruise to the moons of Saturn. 
There were the ships, the starships, 
that span their web of commerce 
from Earth to the Centaurian plan- 
ets, to the Cluster Worlds, to the 
Empire of Waverley, to the Shakes- 
pearian Sector and beyond. 

But they*re only merchantmen, he 
thought, with a young man’s snob- 
bery. 

He wondered in which one of the 
vessels he would be taking passage. 
Merchantman or not, that big ship, 
the one that stood out from her 
neighbors like a city skyscraper 
among village church steeples, seem- 
ed to be a likely enough craft. He 
pulled the folder containing his or- 
ders from his inside breast pocket, 
opened it, read (not for the sec- 
ond time, even) the relevant page. 

. you are to report on board 
the Interstellar Transport Commis- 
sion's Delta Orionis . 

He was not a spaceman yet, in 
spite of his uniform, but he knew 
the Commission’s system of nomen- 
clature. There was the Alpha class 
and the Beta class, and there were 
the Gamma and Delta classes. He 
grinned wrily. His ship was one of 
the smaller ones. Well, at least he 
would not be travelling to Lindis- 
farne Base in an Epsilon class 
tramp. 

Ensign John Grimes, Federation 
Survey Service, shrugged his broad 



shoulders and stepped into the 
ground car waiting to carry him and 
his baggage from the airport to the 
spaceport. 

II 

G rimes looked at the officer stand- 
ing just inside Delta Orionis" 
airlock, a^ she looked at him. He 
felt the beginnings of a flush spread- 
ing over his face, a prickling of the 
roots of his close-cropped hair, and 
felt all the more embarrassed by 
this public display of his embarrass- 
ment. But spaceborn female officers, 
at this time, were almost as scarce 
as hens’ teeth in the Survey Service; 
and such few as he had met all look- 
ed as though they shared a common, 
equine ancestry. It was all wrong, 
thought Grimes. It was unfair that 
this girl (this attractive girl) should 
already be a veteran of interstellar 
voyages while he, for all his uniform 
and commission, should be embark- 
ing upon his first, his very first trip 
outside the bounds of the solar sys- 
tem. 

He let his glance fall from her 
face (but not without reluctance) 
to the braid on her shoulderboards. 
Gold on a white facing. So it wasn’t 
too bad. She was only some sort of 
Paymaster or, to use Merchant Ser- 
vice terminology, only some sort of 
Purser. 

She said, her clear, high voice al- 
most serious, “Welcome aboard the 
Delia 0*Ryan, Admiral.” 

“Ensign,” corrected Grimes stiff- 
ly. “Ensign Grimes . 

“. of the Federation Survey 
Service,” she finished for him. “But 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM

you are all potential admirals.** 
There was the faintest of smiles 
flickering upon her full lips, a bare- 
ly discernible crinkling at the com- 
ers of her eyes. 

Her brown eyes, thought Grimes. 
Brown eyes, and what I can see of 
her hair under that cap seems to be 
auburn . 

She glanced at her wrist watch. 
She told him, her voice now crisp 
and businesslike, “We lift ship in 
precisely ten minutes’ time. Ensign,** 

“Then I’d better get my gear along 
to my cabin. Miss . .?” 

“I’ll look after that, Mr. Grimes. 
Meanwhile, Captain Craven sends his 
compliments and invites you to the 
control room.” 

“Thank you.” Grimes looked past 
and around the girl, trying to dis- 
cover for himself the door that gave 
access to the ship’s axial shaft. He 
was determined not to ask. 

“It’s labelled,” she told him with 
a faint smile. “And the cage is wait- 
ing at this level. Just take it up as 
far as it goes, then walk the rest. 
Or do you want a pilot?” 

“I can manage,” he replied more 
coldly than he had intended, adding, 
thank you.” He could see the tally 
over the door now. It was plain 
enough. AXIAL SHAFT. So was 
the button that he had to press to 
open the door, but the girl pressed 
it for him. He thanked her again 
— and this time his coldness was 
fully intentional — and stepped 
into the cage. The door slid shut 
behind him. The uppermost of the 
studs on the elevator’s control panel 
was marked CAPTAlN^S DECK. 
He pushed it, then stood there and 



watched the lights flashing on the 
panel as he was swiftly lifted to the 
nose of the ship. 

hen he was carried no further 
he got out, found himself on 
a circular walk surrounding the up- 
per extremity of the axial shaft. On 
the outside of the shaft itself there 
was a ladder. After a second’s hesi- 
tation he climbed it, emerged through 
a hatch into the control room. 

It was like the control room of 
the cruiser in which he had made 
his training cruise and yet subtly 
(or not so subtly) unlike it. Every- 
thing — but so had it been aboard 
the Survey Service vessel — was 
functional, but there was an absence 
of high polish, of polishing for polish- 
ing’s sake. Instruments gleamed, but 
it was the dull gleam that comes 
from long and continual use and 
matched the dull gleam of the buttons 
and rank marks on the uniforms of 
the officers already seated at their 
stations, the spacemen to whom, aft- 
er aU, uniform was no more (and 
no less) than an obligatory working 
rig. 

The big man with the four gold 
bars on each shoulder half turned 
his head as Grimes came up through 
the hatch. “Glad to have you aboard, 
Ensign,*’ he said perfunctorily. 
“Grab yourself a seat; there’s a 
spare one alongside the mate’s. Sorry 
there’s no time for introductions 
right now. We’re due to get up- 
stairs.” 

“Here!” grunted one of the. of- 
ficers. 

Grimes made his way to the va- 
cant acceleration chair, dropped in- 




10 



IF 




to it, strapped himself in. While he 
was so doing he heard the captain 
ask, “All secure, Mr. Kennedy?” 
“No, sir.” 

“Then why the hell not?” 

“I’m still waiting for the purser’s 
report, sir.” 

“Are you?” Then, with a long- 
suffering sigh, “I suppose she’s stiU 
tucking some passenger into her — 
or his — bunk . .” 

“She could still be stowing some 
passenger’s gear, sir,” contributed 
Grimes. “Mine,” he added. 

“Indeed?” The captain’s voice 
was cold and elaborately uninterest- 
ed. 

Over the intercom came a female 
voice. “Purser to Control. All secure 
below.” 

“And about bloody well time,” 
grumbled the shipmaster. Then, to 
the officer at the transceiver, “Mr. 
Digby, kindly obtain clearance.” 
“Obtain clearance, sir,” acknowl- 
edged that young man brightly. 
Then, into his microphone, **Delta 
Orionis to Port Control. Request 
clearance to lift ship. Over.” 

“Port Control to Delta Orionis, 
You may lift. Bon voyage. Over.” 
“Thank you. Port Control. Over 
and out'" 

T hen the ship was throbbing to the 
rhythmic beat of her Inertial 
Drive, and Grimes felt that odd 
sense of buoyancy, of near weight- 
lessness, that persisted until the ves- 
sel broke contact with the ground; 
and then the still gentle acceleration 
induced the reverse effect. He look- 
ed out through the nearest viewport. 
Already the ochre surface of the 



desert, streaked by the long, black 
shadows of ships and spaceport 
buildings, was far below them, with 
the vessels and the immobile con- 
structions looking like toys and one 
or two surface vehicles like scurrying 
insects. Far to the north, dull-ruddy 
against the blue of the sky, there 
was a sandstorm. // that sky were 
darker, thought Grimes, this would 
look like Mars, and the mental com- 
parison reminded him that he, too, 
was a spaceman, that he, too, h^ 
been around (although only within 
the bounds of Sol’s planetary sys- 
tem). Even so, he was Survey Ser- 
vice, and these others with him in 
Control were only Merchant Of- 
ficers, fetchers and carriers, inter- 
stellar coach and truck drivers. But 
he envied them their quiet com- 
petency. 

Still the ship lifted, and the space- 
port below her dwindled, and the 
land horizon to the north and the 
now visible sea horizon to the south 
began to display the beginnings of 
curvature. Still she lifted. And over- 
head the sky was dark, and the first 
bright stars, Sirius and Canopus, Al- 
pha and Beta Centauri, were spark- 
ling there and beckoning as they had 
beckoned for ages immemorial be- 
fore the first clumsy rocket clamber- 
ed heavenward up the ladder of its 
own fiery exhaust, before the first 
aeroplane spread its flimsy wings, 
before the first balloon was lifted 
by the hot, expanding gases from its 
airborne furnace . 

“Mr. Grimes,” said the captain 
suddenly, his voice neither friendly 
nor unfriendly. 

“Sir?”

of the Van Allens.” 

“I know, sir,” said Grimes, then 
he wished that he could unsay the 
words. But it was too late. He was 
conscious of the shipmaster’s hostile 
silence, of the amused contempt of 
the merchant officers. He shrank 
into his chair, tried to make himself 
as inconspicuous as possible. The 
ship’s people talked among them- 
selves in low voices, ignoring him. 
They allowed themselves a period of 
relaxation, producing and lighting 
cigarettes. Nobody offered the en- 
sign one. 

Sulkily he fumbled for his pipe, 
filled it, lit it. The chief officer 
coughed with quite unnecessary 
vigor. The captain growled, “Put that 
out, please,” and muttered some- 
thing about stinking out the control 
room. He himself was puffing at a 
villainous black cigar. 

'"j^he ship lifted, and below her the 
Earth was now a great sphere, 
three quarters in darkness, the line 
of the terminator drawn across land 
masses, cloud fornutions and oceans. 
City lights twinkled in the gloom 
like' star clusters, like nebulae. In a 
quiet voice an officer was calling 
readings from the radar altimeter. 

To the throbbing of the Inertial 
Drive was added the humming, 
shrilling to a whine of the direc- 
tional gyroscopes as the ship turned 
about her short axis hunting the tar- 
get star. The pseudogravity of centri- 
fugal force was at an odd angle to 
that of acceleration, and the resultant 
was at an odder angle still. Grimes 
began to feel sick and was actually 



thankful that the captain had made 
him put his pipe out. Alarm bells 
soimded, and then somebody was 
saying over the intercom, “Prepare 
for acceleration. Prepare for accel- 
eration. Listen for the count down.” 

The count down. Part of the long 
tradition of space travel, a hang-over 
from the days of the first, unreali- 
able rockets. Spaceships still used 
rockets, but only as auxiliaries, as a 
means of delivering thrust in a hurry, 
of building up acceleration in a short 
time. 

At the word Zerol the Inertial 
Drive was cut, and, simultaneously, 
the Reaction Drive flared into vio- 
lent lift. The giant hand of accelera- 
tion bore down heavily upon all in 
the ship — then, suddenly, at a curt 
order from the captain, lifted. 

Grimes became aware of a thin, 
high keening, the song of the ever- 
precessing gyroscopes of the Manns- 
chenn Drive. He knew the theory of 
it — as what spaceman did not? — 
although the mathematics of it were 
beyond the comprehension of all but 
a handful of men and women. He 
knew what was happening, knew that 
the ship, now that speed had been 
built up, was, as one of his instruc- 
tors had put it, going ahead in Space 
and astern in Time. He felt, as he had 
been told that he would feel, the un- 
canny sensation of de]a vii, and he 
watched the outlines of the control 
room and of every person and instru- 
ment in the compartment shift and 
shimmer, the colors sagging down the 
spectrum. 

Ahead, the stars were pulsating 
spirals of opalescence; astern. Earth 
and Moon were frighteningly dis-

t6rted, uncanny compromises be- 
tween the sphere and the tesseract. 
But this was no more than the mer- 
est subliminal glimpse; in the twink- 
ling of an eye the Home Planet and 
her daughter were no more than 
dust motes whirling down the dark 
dimensions. 

The captain lit a fresh cigar. “Mr. 
Kennedy,” he said, “you may set 
normal Deep Space watches.” He 
turned to Grimes. His full beard al- 
most hid his expression, that of one 
performing a social duty with no en- 
thusiasm. “Will you join me in my 
day cabin. Ensign?” 

“It will be my pleasure, sir,” lied 
Grimes. 

Ill 

H andling his big body with easy 
grace in the Free Fall con- 
ditions, the captain led the way from 
the control room. Grimes followed 
slowly and clumsily, but with a feel- 
ing of great thankfulness that after 
his training cruise he wias no longer 
subject to spacesickness. There were 
drugs, of course, and passengers used 
them, but a spaceman was expected 
to be independent of pharmaceutical 
aids. Even so, the absence of any 
proper “up” or “down” bothered him 
more than he cared to admit. 

The shipmaster slid open the door 
to his accommodation, motioned to 
Grimes to enter, murmuring sardoni- 
cally, “Now you see how the poor 
live.” The so-called poor, thought 
Grimes, didn’t do themselves at all 
badly, lliis deep-space sitting room 
was considerably larger than the day 
cabin of the Survey Service cruiser’s 



captain had been. True» it was also 
shabbier — but it was (far more com- 
fortable. Its decoratioDS, whidh would 
never have been approved aboard a 
warship, were obviously the private 
property of the master. There were 
a full dozen holograms on the bulk- 
head — all of them widely differing, 
but all of them covering the same 
subject matter. Not that the subject 
matter was covered. 

“My harem,” grunted the captain. 
“That one there, the redhead, I met 
on Caribbea. Quite a stop-over that 
was. The green-haired wench — and 
you can see that it’s not a dye job, 
although I’ve often wondered why 
women can’t be thorough — isn’t 
human, of course. But indubitably 
humanoid and indubitably mam- 
malian. Belongs to Brrrooonooo- 
rrrooo, one of the worlds of the 
Shaara Empire. The local Queen 
Mother offered to sell Lalia — that’s 
her name — to me for a case of 
Scotch. And I was tempted . .” He 
sighed. “But you Service Survey 
types aren’t the only one who have 
to live by regulations.” 

Grimes said nothing, tried to hide 
his interest in the art gallery. 

“But take a pew. Ensign. Spit on 
the mat and call the cat a bastard — 
this is Liberty Hall.” 

Grimes pulled himself to one of 
the comfortable chairs, strapped 
himself in. He said lamely, “I don’t 
see any cat, sir.” 

“A figure of speech,” growled the 
captain, seating himself next to what 
looked like a drink cabinet. “Well, 
Mr. Grimes, your Commandant at 
the Academy, Commodore Brad- 
shaw, is an old friend and shipmate

of mine. He said that you were a 
very profnismg young officer . 
like a balloon in a comic strip the 
unspoken words, “God knows why,” 
hung between them. and asked 
me to keep an eye on you. But I 
have already gained the impression 
that there is very little that a mere 
merchant skipper such as myself will 
be able to teach you.” 

Grimes looked at the bulky figure 
seated opposite him, at the radiation- 
darkened skin of the face above the 
black, silver-streaked beard, at the 
fiercely jutting nose, at the faded 
but bright and intelligent blue eyes, 
the eyes that were regarding him 
with more than a hint of amused 
contempt. He blushed miserably as 
he recalled his brash, “I know, sir,” 
in this man’s own control room. He 
said, with an effort, ‘This is my 
first Deep Space voyage, sir.” 

“I know.” Surprisingly the Cap- 
tain chuckled and, as though to cele- 
brate this minor scoring over his 
guest, opened the liquor cabinet. 
“Pity to have to suck this excellent 
Manzanila out of a bulb; but that’s 
one of the hardships of Free Fall. 
Here!” He tossed a little pear-shaped 
container to Grimes, kept one for 
himself. “Your health, Ensign!” 

“And yours, sir.” 

The wine was too dry for Grimes* 
taste, but he made a pretense of en- 
joying it. He was thankful that he 
was not asked to have a second drink. 
Meanwhile, his host had pulled a 
typewritten sheet from a drawer of 
has desk, was looking at it. “Let me 
see, now . You’re in cabin 15, on 
D Deck. You’ll be able to find your 
own way down, won’t you?” 



Grimes said that he would and 
unbuckled his lapstrap. It was ob- 
vious that the party was over. 

“Good. Now, as an officer of the 
Survey Service you have the free- 
dom of the control room and the 
engine rooms . .” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“Just don’t abuse the privilege, 
that’s all.” 

After that, thought Grimes, Vm 
not likely to take advantage of it, let 
alone abuse it. He let himself float 
up from the chair, said, “Thank you, 
sir.” For the drink, or for the ad- 
monition? What did it matter? “I’ll 
be getting down to my cabin, sir. 
I’ve some unpacking to do.” 

“As you please, Mr. Grimes.” 

T he captain, his social duty dis- 
charged, had obviously lost in- 
terest in his guest. Grimes let him- 
self out of the cabin, made his way, 
not without difficulty to the door 
in the axial shaft. He was surprised 
at the extent to which one not very 
large drink had interfered with the 
control of his body in Free Fall. 
Emerging from the elevator cage on 
D Deck he stumbled, literally, into 
the purser. “Let go of me,” she or- 
dered, “or I shall holler ‘rape!’ ” 
That, he thought, is all I need to 
make this trip a really happy one. 
She disengaged herself, moved 
back from him, her slim, sandalled 
feet, magnetically shod, maintaining 
contact with the steel decking, but 
gracefully, with a dancing motion. 
She laughed. “I take it that you’ve 
just come from a home truth session 
with B.B.” 

“B.B.?”

“The Bearded Bastard. But don’t 
take it too much to heart. He’s that 
way with all junior officers. The 
fact that you’re Survey Service is 
only incidental.” 

“Thank you for telling me.” 

“His trouble,” she went on, “his 
real trouble is that he’s painfully 
shy.” 

He’s not the only one, thought 
Grimes, looking at the girl. She 
seemed even more attractive than on 
the occasion of their first meeting. 
She had changed into the shorts- 
and-shirt shipboard uniform, and 
she was one of the rare women who 
can wear such a rig without looking 
lumpy and clumsy. There was no 
cap now to hide her hair — smooth, 
lustrous, with coppery glints, with a 
straight white parting, bisecting the 
crown of her finely shaped head. 

She was well aware of his scru- 
tiny. She said, “You must excuse 
me. Ensign. I have to look after the 
other customers. They aren’t season- 
ed spacemen like you.” 

Suddenly bold, he said, “But be- 
fore you go, what is your name?” 
She smiled dazzlingly. “You’ll 
find a list of all ship’s personnel 
among the notices posted in your 
cabin. I’m included.” Then she was 
gone, gliding rapidly around the 
curve of the alleyway. 

He looked at the numbers over 
the cabin doors, outboard from the 
axial shaft, made a full circuit of 
that hollow pillar before he realized 
that this was only the inner ring, 
that he would have to follow one 
of the radial alleyways to reach his 
own accommodation. He finally 
found No. 15, let himself in. 



His first action was to inspect the 
framed notices on the bulkhead. 

LSS. Delta Orionis, he read. 

Captain /. Craven, O.G.S., S.S,R. 
So the Old Man held a Reserve com- 
mission. And the Order of the 
Golden Star was awarded for some- 
thing more than good attendance. 

Mr. P. Kennedy, Chief Officer. 

He ignored the other name on the 
list while he searched for the one 
he wanted. Ah, here it was. 

Miss Jane Pentecost, Purser. 

He repeated the name to hirnself, 
thinking that, despite the old play 
on words, this Jane was not plain. 
(But Janes rarely are.) Jane Pente- 
cost . Then, feeling that he should 
be showing some professional inter- 
est, he acquainted himself with the 
names of the other members of the 
ship’s crew. He was intrigued by the 
manning scale, amazed that such a 
large vessel, relatively speaking, 
could be run by such a small number 
of people. But this was not a war- 
ship; there were no weapons to be 
manned, there would never be the 
need to put a landing party ashore 
on the surface of a hostile planet. 
The Merchant Service could afford 
to automate, to employ machinery 
in lieu of ratings. The Survey Service 
could not. 

Virtuously he studied the notices 
dealing with emergency procedures, 
ship’s routine, recreational facilities 
and all the rest of it, examined with 
care the detailed plan of the ship. 
Attached to this was a card, signed 
by the master, requesting passengers 
to refrain, as much as possible, from 
using the elevator in the axial shaft, 
going on to say that it was essential, 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM

for the good of their physical health, 
that they miss no opportunity for 
taJdng exercise. (In a naval vessel 
thought Grimes, with a slight sneer, 
that would not be a request — it 
would be an order. And, in any case, 
there would be compulsory calis- 
thenics for all hands.) 

He studied the plan again and 
toyed with the idea of visiting the 
bar before dinner. He decided against 
it; he was still feeling the effects of 
the drink that the captain had given 
him. So, to pass the time, he unpack- 
ed slowly and carefully, methodically 
stowing his effects in the drawers 
under the bunk. Then, but not with- 
out reluctance, he changed from his 
uniform into his one formal civilian 
suit. One of the officer-instructors 
at the Academy had advised this. 
“Always wear civvies when you’re 
travelling as passenger. If you’re in 
uniform, some old duck’s sure to 
take you for one of the ship’s officers 
and ask you all sorts of technical 
questions to which you don’t know 
the answers.’’ 

While he was adjusting his frilled 
cravat in front of the mirror the 
sonorous notes of a gong boomed 
from the intercom. 

IV 

'"T^'he dining salon was much more 
JL ornate than the gunroom of that 
training cruiser had been and more 
ornate than her wardroom. The es- 
sentials were the same, of course, as 
they are in any sihip: tables and 
chairs secured to the deck, each seat 
fitted with its strap so that the com- 
forting pressure of buttocks on 



padding could give an illusion of 
gravity. Each table was covered with 
a gaily colored cloth, but beneath 
the fabric there was the inevitable 
stainless steel to which the stainless 
steel service would be held by its 
own magnetic fields. But what im- 
pressed Grimes was the care that 
had been taken, the ingenuity that 
had been exercised to make this 
compartment look like anything but 
part of a ship. 

The great circular pillar of the 
axial shaft was camouflaged by trel- 
liswork, and the trelliswork itself was 
almost hidden by the luxuriance of 
some broad-leaved climbing plant 
that he could not identify. Smaller 
pillars were similarly covered, and 
there was a further efflorescence of 
living decoration all around the cir- 
cular outer wall — the wall that 
must be the inner skin of the ship. 
And there were windows in this wall. 
No, Grimes decided, not windows, 
but holograms. The glowing, three- 
dimensional pictures presented and 
maintained the illusion that this was 
a hall set in the middle of some great 
park. But on what world? Grimes 
could not say. Trees, bushes and 
flowers were unfamiliar, and the 
color of the sky subtly strange. 

He looked around him at his fel- 
low diners, at the dozen passengers 
and the ship’s officers, most of 
whom were already seated. The of- 
ficers were in neat undress uniform. 
About half the male passengers were, 
like himself, formally attired; the 
others were sloppy in shorts and 
shirts. But this was the first night 
out, and some laxity was allowable. 
The women, however, all seemed to 

IP 



16 




have decided to outshine the glow- 
ing flowers of the vine that were 
sudh an essential part of the decor, 
those other flowers that flamed out- 
side the windows that were not win- 
dows. 

There was the captain, unmis- 
takable with his beard and the shim- 
mering rainbow of ribbons on the 
left breast of his blouse. There were 
the passengers at his table: the men 
inclined to portliness and pomposity, 
their women sleek and slim and ex- 
pensive looking. Grimes was relieved 
to see that there was no vacant place 
— and yet, at the same time, rather 
hurt. He knew that he was only an 
ensign, a one ringer, and a very new 
ensign at that — but, after all, the 
Survey Service was the Survey Ser- 
vice. 

He realized that somebody was 
addressing him. It was a girl, a small, 
rather chubby blonde. She was in 
uniform: a white shirt with black 
should erboards, each bearing a nar- 
row white stripe, and sharply creased, 
tapered black slacks and black, high- 
ly polished shoes. Grimes assumed, 
correctly, that she was a junior mem- 
ber of the purser’s staff. “Mr. 
Grimes,” she said, “will you follow 
me, ple^e? You’re at Miss Pente- 
cost’s table.” 

Willingly he followed the girl. She 
led him around the axial shaft to a 
table for four at which the purser 
with two passengers, a man and a 
woman, was already seated. Jane 
Pentecost was attir^ as was his 
guide, the severity of her gold- 
trimmed black and white in pleasing 
contrast to the pink and blue frills 
and flounces that clad the other 



woman, her slenderness in still more 
pleasing contrast to the other’s untidy 
plumpness. 

She smiled and said pleasantly, 
“Be seated. Admiral.” 

“Admiral?” asked the man at her 
left, unpleasantly incredulous. He 
had, obviously, been drinking. He 
was a rough looking customer, in 
spite of the attempt that he had 
made to dress for dinner. He was 
twice the ensign’s age, perhaps, al- 
though the heavily lined face under 
the scanty sandy hair made him 
look older. “Admiral?” He laughed, 
revealing irregular yellow teeth. “In 
what? The Space Scouts?” 

J ane Pentescost firmly took con- 
trol. She said, “Allow me to in- 
troduce Ensign Grimes, of the Sur- 
vey Service ...” 

“Survey Service . Space 

Scouts . S.S. What’s the dif- 
ference?” 

“Plenty!” answered Grimes hotly. 
The purser ignored the exchange. 
“Ensign, this is Mrs. Baxter . .” 
“Pleased to meet you. I’m sure,” 
simpered ^e woman. 

“And Mr. Baxter.” 

Baxter extended his hand reluct- 
antly, and Grimes took it reluctantly. 
The amenities observed, he pulled 
himself into his seat and adjusted 
his lapstrap. He was facing Jane 
Pentecost. The man was on his right, 
the woman on his left. He glanced 
first at her, then at her husband, 
wondering how to start and to main- 
tain a conversation. But this was the 
purser’s table, and that was her re- 
sponsibility. 

She accepted it. “Now you’re see- 

lE 



18 




ing how the poor live, Admiral,” 
she remarked lightly. 

Grimes, taking a tentative sip 
from his bulb of consomme, did not 
think that the self-styled poor did 
themselves at all badly and said as 
much. The girl grinned and told him 
that (the first night out was too early 
to draw conclusions. “We’re still on 
sboreside meat and vegetables,” she 
told him, “and you’ll not be getting 
your first taste of our instant table 
wine until tomorrow. Tonight we 
wallow in the unwonted luxury of a 
quite presentable Montrachet. When 
we start living on the produce of 
our own, so-called farm, washing it 
down with our own reconstituted 
plonk, you’ll see the difference.” 

The ensign replied that in his ex- 
perience it didn’t matter if food 
came from tissue-culture vats or the 
green fields of Earth — what was 
important was the cook. 

“Wide experience. Admiral?” she 
asked sweetly. 

“Not very,” he admitted. “But 
the gunroom cook in my last ship 
couldn’t boil water without burning 
it.” 

Baxter, noisily enjoying his dinner, 
said that this preoccupation with 
food and drink was symptomatic of 
the decadence of Earth. As he spoke 
his knife grated unpleasantly on the 
steel spines that secured his charcoal 
broiled steak to his plate. 

Grimes considered inquiring if the 
man thought that good table man- 
ners were also a symptom of de- 
cadence, then thought better of it. 
After all, this was not his table. In- 
stead, he asked, “And where are you 
from, Mr. Baxter?” 



“The Rim Worlds, Mr. Grimes. 
Where we’re left to sink or swim, so 
we’ve no time for much else than 
keeping ourselves afloat.” He sucked 
noisily from his biilb of wine. 
“Things might be a httle easier for 
us if your precious Survey Service 
did something about keeping the 
trade routes open.” 

“That is our job,” said Grimes 
stiffly. “And we do it.” 

“Do you hell! There’s not a pi- 
rate in the galaxy but can nm rings 
round you!” 

“Practically every pirate has been 
hunted down and destroyed,” Grimes 
told him coldly. 

“ ‘Practically every pirate,’ the 
man says! A few small-time bunglers, 
he means!” 

“Even the notorious Black Bart,” 
persisted Grimes. 

“Black Bart!” Baxter, spluttering 
through his full mouth, gestured 
with his laden fork at Grimes. 
“Black Bart! He wasn’t much. Once 
he and that popsy of his split brass 
rags, he was all washed up. I’m 
talkin’ about the real pirates, the 
ones whose ships wear national 
colors instead o’ the Jolly Roger, 
the ones that your precious Survey 
Service daren’t say hoo to. The ones 
who do the dirty work for the 
Federation.” 

“Such as?” asked Grimes frigidly. 

“So now you’re playin’ the bleedin’ 
innocent. Never heard o’ the Duchy 
o’ Waldegren, Mr. Ensign Grimes?” 

“Of course. Autonomous, but they 
and the Federation have signed 
what’s called a Pact of Perpetual 
Amity.” 

“Pretty words, ain’t they? Suppose

we analyze tbem. Suppose we an- 
alyze by (analogy. D*yeir know much 
about aniiiniMs^ Mr. Finjrijg n Grimes?^ 
**Anunials?" Grhnes wals puzzleld. 
“Well, I suppose I do iknow some- 
thing. Tve t^lcen the usual courses 
in xeno-biology . .*• 

“Never mind that. You’re a Terry. 
Let’s oon&ie ourselves to a selection 
of yer own Terran four-footed 
friends.” 

“What the hell are you driving 
at?” flared Grimes, losing his tem- 
per. He threw an apologetic glance 
in Jane Pentecost’s direction, saw 
that she was more amused than 
shocked. 

46Tust think about a Pact of 
Perpetual Amity between an 
elephant and a tom cat,” said Bax- 
ter. “A fat an’ lazy elephant. A lean, 
scrawny, vicious tom cat. If the ele- 
phant wanted to he could convert 
that cat into a fur bedside rug just 
by steppin’ on him. But he doesn’t 
want to. He leaves the cat alone, 
just because the cat is useful to him. 
He does more than just leave him 
alone. He an’ his feline cobber pull 
out their pens from wherever they 
keep ’em an’ sign their famous Pact. 

“In case you haven’t worked it 
out for yourself, the elephant’s the 
Federation, an’ the tom cat’s the 
Duchy of Waldegren.” 

“But why?” asked Grimes. “But 
whyT 

“Don’t they teach you puppies any 
intersteUar politics? Or are those 
courses reserved for the top brass? 
Well, Mr. Grimes, I’ll tell you. 
There’s one animal that has the ele- 
phant really worried. Believe it or 



not, he’s soared o* mice. An’ there’re 
quite a few mice inside the Federa- 
tioD, mice that make the elephant 
nervous by their rustlings, an’ 
ecurryings, an’ their squeaky de- 
mands for full autonomy. That’s 
where the oat comes in. By his 
free use of his teeth an’ claws, by 
his very presence, he keeps the mice 
quiet.” 

“And just who are these famous 
mice, Mr. Baxter?” asked Grimes, 
innocently. 

“Don’t they teach you nothin’ in 
your bleedin’ Academy? Well, I’ll 
tell you. 

“In our neck o’ the woods, the 
mice are the Rim Worlds, an’ 
the tom cat, as I’ve already made 
clear, is the Duchy o’ Waldegren. 
The Duchy gets away with murder 
— murder an’ piracy. But accordin’ 
to the Duchy, an’ accordin’ to your 
big, stupid elephant of a Federation, 
it’s not piracy. It’s — now, lemme 
see, what fancy words have been 
used o’ late? Contraband Control. 
Suppression of Espionage. Violation 
of the Three Million Mile Limit. 
Every time that there’s an act of 
piracy, there’s some quote legal un- 
quote excuse for it, an’ it’s upheld 
by the Federation’s tame legal eagles, 
an’ you Survey Service sissies just sit 
there on your big, fat backsides an’ 
don’t lift a pinkie against your dear, 
murderous pals, the Waldegrenese. 
If you ever did, they’d send you 
screaming back to Base, where some 
dear old daddy of an Admiral’d 
spank your little plump bottoms for 
you.” 

“Please, Mr. Baxter!” admonished 
Jane Pentecost.

“Sorry, Miss. I got sort of carried 
away. But my young brother was 
Third Reaction Drive Engineer of 
the old Bunyip when she went miss- 
ing. Nothin* was ever proved, but 
the Waldegrenese Navy was boldin’ 
fleet maneuvers in the sector she was 
passin’ through when last heard from. 
Oh, they’re cunnin* rascals. They’ll 
never go for one o’ these ships, or 
one o’ the Trans-Galactic Clippers; 
it’ll always be some poor little tramp 
that nobody’ll ever miss but the 
friends an’ relatives o’ the crew. An*,. 
I suppose, the underwriters, but 
Llyold’s make such a packet out o* 
the ships that don’t get lost that 
they can well afford to shell out now 
an’ again. Come to that, it must 
suit ’em. As long as there’re a few 
‘overdues’ an* ‘missings’ they can 
keep the premiums up.” 

“But I still can’t see how piracy 
can possibly pay,” protested Grimes, 
staunchly. 

“O’ course it pays. Your friend 
Black Bart made it pay. An’ if you’re 
goin’ to all the expense of building 
an’ maintaining a war fleet, it might 
just as well earn its keep. Even your 
famous Survey Service might show 
a profit if you were allowed to 
pounce on every fat merchantman 
who came within range o’ your 
guns.” 

“But for the Federation to con- 
done piracy, as you’re trying to make 
out . That’s utterly fantastic and 
out of the question.” 

“If you lived on the Rim, you 
might think different,” snarled Bax- 
ter. 

And Jane Pentecost contributed, 
“Not piracy. Confrontation.” 



A s soon as the meal was finished 
the Baxters left rather hastily 
to make their way to the bar, leaving 
Grimes and Jane Pentecost to the 
leisurely enjoyment of their coffee. 
When the couple was out of ear- 
shot, Grimes remarked, “So those 
are Rim Worlders. They’re the first 
I’ve met.” 

“They’re not, you know,” the girl 
told him. 

“But they are. Oh, there are one 
or two in the Survey Service, but 
I’ve never run across them. Now I 
don’t particularly want to.” 

“But you did meet one Rim 
Worlder before you met the Bax- 
ters.” 

“The captain?” 

She laughed. “Don’t let him hear 
you say that — not unless you want 
to take a space walk without a suit!” 
“Then who?” 

“Who could it be. Admiral? 
Whom have you actually met, to 
talk to, so far in this ship? Use your 
crust.” 

He stared at her incredulously. 
“Not you?” 

“Who else?” She laughed again, 
but with a touch of bitterness. “We 
aren’t all like our late manger com- 
panions, you know. Or should know. 
Even so, you’d count yourself lucky 
to have Jim Baxter by your side in 
any real jam. It boils down to this. 
Some of us have acquired a certain 
veneer. Some of us haven’t. Period.” 
“But how did you . .?” He grop- 
ed for words that would not be of- 
fensive to conclude the sentence. 
“How did I get into this galley? 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



21 




Easily enough. I started my space- 
faring career as a not very competent 
Catering Officer in Jumbuk, one of 
the Sundowner Line’s more ancient 
and decrepit tramps. I had to pay 
off sick in Elsinore. Could have been 
my own cooking that put me in hos- 
pital. Anyhow, I was just about re- 
covered when the Commission’s 
Epsilon Serpentis blew in, and she 
landed her purser with a slightly 
broken leg. She’d learned the hard 
way that the Golden Rule — stop 
whatever you*re doing and secure 
everything when the acceleration 
warning sounds — is meant to be 
observed. The doctor was luckier. 
She broke his fall . .” 

Grimes was about to ask what the 
doctor and the purser had been do- 
ing, then was th ankf ul that he had 
not done so. He was acutely con- 
scious of the crimson blush that 
burned the skin of his face. 

“You must realize,’* said the girl 
drily, “that merchant vessels with 
mixed crews are not monastic in- 
stitutions. But where was I? Oh, yes. 
On Elsinore. Persuading the master 
of the Snaky Eppy that I was a fit 
and proper person to take over his 
pursering. I managed to convince 
him that I was at least proper; I 
still can’t see what my predecessor 
saw in that lecherous old goat of a 
quack, although the Second Mate 
had something . .” Grimes felt a 
sudden twinge of jealousy. “Anyhow, 
he signed me on, as soon as I agreed 
to waive repatriation. 

“It was a long voyage; as you 
know, the Epsilon Class ships are 
little better than tramps themselves. 
It was a long voyage, but I enjoyed 



it — seeing all the worlds that I’d 
read about and heard about and al- 
ways wanted to visit. The Sundowner 
Line doesn’t venture far afield, just 
the four Rim Worlds and now and 
again the Shakespearian Sector and, 
once in a blue moon, one of the 
drearier planets of the Empire of 
Waverley. The Commission’s tramps, 
of course, run everywhere. 

“Anyhow, we finally berthed at 
Woomera. The Old Man must have 
put in a good report about me, be- 
cause I was called before the Local 
Superintending Purser and offered a 
berth, as a junior, in one of the 
Alpha Class liners. Alpha Centauri, 
if you must know. She was on the 
Sol-Sirius service. Nothing very 
glamorous in the way of ports of 
call, but she was a fine ship, beauti- 
fully kept, efficiently run. A couple 
of years there knocked most of the 
sharp corners off me. After that, a 
spell as Assistant Purser of Beta 
Geminorum. Atlanta, Caribbea, Ca- 
rinthia and the Cluster Worlds. And 
then my first ship as Chief Purser. 
This one.” 

O ne of Jane’s girls brought them 
fresh bulbs of coffee and am- 
poules of a sweet, potent liqueur. 
When she was gone Grimes asked, 
“What are the Rim Worlds like?” 
She waited until he had applied 
the flame of his lighter to the tip of 
her long, thin cigar, then answered, 
“Cold. Dark. Lonely. But . They 
have something. The feeling of being 
on a frontier. The frontier. The last 
frontier.” 

“The frontier of the dark . .” 
murmured Grimes. 



22 



IF 




“Yes. The frontier of the dark. 
And the names of our planets. They 
have something too. A . poetry? 
Yes, that’s the word. Lorn, Ultimo, 
Faraway and Thule . And there’s 
that night sky of ours, especially at 
some times of the year. There’s the 
galaxy — a great, dim-glowing 
lenticulate nebula — and the rest is 
darkness. At other times of the year 
there’s only the darkness, the black- 
ness that’s made even more intense 
by the sparse, faint stars that are 
the other Rim Suns, by the few, 
faint luminosities that are the dis- 
tant island universes that we shall 
never reach.” 

She shivered almost impercep- 
tibly. “And always there’s that sense 
of being on the very edge of things, 
of hanging on by our fingernails with 
the abyss of the eternal night gaping 
beneath us. The Rim Worlders aren’t 
a spacefaring people; only a very 
few of us ever get the urge. It’s 
analogous, perhaps, to your Maoris. 
I spent a leave once in New Zea- 
land and got interested in the history 
of the country. The Maoris come of 
seafaring stock. Their ancestors 
made an epic voyage from their 
paradisiacal homeland to those 
rather grim and dreary little islands 
hanging there, all by themselves, 
in the cold and stormy southern 
ocean, lashed by frigid gales sweep- 
ing up from the Antarctic. And 
something — the isolation? the cli- 
mate? — killed the wanderlust that 
was an essential part of the make- 
up of their race. You’ll find very 
few Maoris at sea or in space, al- 
though there’s no dearth of Po- 
lynesians from the home archipela- 



goes aboard the surface ships serving 
the ports of the Pacific. And there 
are quite a few, too, in the Com- 
mission’s ships . .” 

“We have our share in the Sur- 
vey Service,” said Grimes. “But tell 
me, how do you man your vessels? 
This Sundowner Line of yours . .” 
“There are always the drifters, the 
no-hopers, the cast-offs from the In- 
terstellar Transport Commission, and 
Trans-Galactic Clippers and Waver- 
ley Royal Mail and all the rest of 
them.” 

“And from the Survey Service?” 
The question lifted her out of her 
sombre mood. “No,” she replied 
with a smile. “Not yet.” 

“Not ever,” said Grimes. 

VI 

O nce his initial shyness had worn 
off, and with it much of his 
Academy-induced snobbery. Grimes 
began to enjoy the voyage. After 
all. Survey Service or no Survey Ser- 
vice, this was a ship and he was a 
spaceman. He managed to accept 
the fact that most of the ship’s of- 
ficers, even the most junior of them, 
were far more experienced spacemen 
than he was. Than he was now, he 
often reminded himself. At the back 
of his mind lurked the smug knowl- 
edge that, for all of them, a captain- 
cy was the very limit of promotion, 
whereas he, one day, would be ad- 
dressed in all seriousness as Jane 
Pentecost now addressed him in 
jest. 

He was a frequent visitor to the 
control room but, remembering the 
Master’s admonition, was careful not 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



23 




to get in the way. The watch officers 
accepted him almost as one of them 
and were willing to initiate him in- 
to the tricky procedure of obtaining 
a fix with the interstellar drive in 
operation — an art, he was told, 
rather than a science. 

Having obtained the permission of 
the chief engineers, he prowled 
through ±e vessel’s machinery 
^spaces, trying to supplement his 
theoretical knowledge of reaction, 
inertial and interstellar drives with 
something more practical. The first 
two, of course, were idle and would 
be until the ship emerged from her 
warped Space/Time back into the 
normal continuum; but there was 
the Pile, the radio-active heart of 
the ship, and there was the auxiliary 
machinery that, in this tiny, man- 
made planet, did the work that on a 
natural world is performed by winds, 
rivers, sunlight and gravity. 

There was the Mannsohenn Drive 
Room; and, inside this holy of holies, 
no man need fear to admit that he 
was soared by the uncanny com- 
plexity of over-precessing gyroscopes. 
He stared at the tumbling rotors, 
the gleaming wheels that seemed al- 
ways on the verge of vanishing into 
nothingness, that rolled down the 
dark dimensions, dragging the ship 
and all aboard her with them. He 
stared, hypnotized, lost in a vague, 
disturbing dream in which Past and 
Present and Future were inextricably 
mingled. And the chief Interstellar 
Drive Engineer took him firmly by 
the arm and led him from the com- 
partment. “Look at that time-twister 
too long,” he growled, “and you’ll 
be meeting yourself coming back!” 



There was the “faim,^* the deck 
of yeast- and tissue-culture vats 
wihich was no more (and no less) 
than a highly efficient protein fac- 
tory, and the deck where stood the 
great, transparent globes in which 
algae converted the ship’s organic 
waste and sewage back into usable 
form (processed as nutriment for 
the yeasts and the tissue-culture and 
as fertilizer for the hydroponic tanks, 
the Bio-Chemist was careful to ex- 
plain), and the deck where luxuri- 
ant vegetation spilled over from the 
trays and almost barricaded the in- 
spection walks, the source of vita- 
mins and of flowers for the saloon 
tables and, at the same time, the 
ship’s main air-conditioning unit. 

G rimes said to Jane Pentecost, who 
had accompanied him on this 
tour of inspection, “You know, I 
envy your captain.” 

“From you. Admiral,” she scoff- 
ed, “that is something. But why?” 
“How can I put it? You people 
do the natural way what we do 
with chemicals and machinery. The 
captain of a warship is captain of a 
warship. Period. But your Captain 
Craven is absolute monarch of a 
little world.” 

“A warship,” she told him, “is 
supposed to be able to go on func- 
tioning as such even with every com- 
partment holed. A warship cannot 
afford to depend for the survival of 
her crew upon the survival of hosts 
of other air-breathing organisms.” 
“Straight from the book,” he said. 
Then, puzzled, “But for a . He 
hesitated. 

“But for a woman, or for a pur- 

IP 



24 




ser, or for a mere merdiaiit officer I 
know too much/* she finished for 
him. “But I can read, you know. 
And when I was in the Sundowner 
Line, I, as well as all the other 
officers, was supposed to keep up 
with all the latest Survey Service 
publications.” 

“But why?” he asked. 

“But why not? We’ll have a navy 
of our own, one day. Just stick 
around. Admiral.” 

“Secession?” he enquired, mak- 
ing it sound like a dirty word. 
“Once again — why not?” 

“It’d never work,” he told her. 
“The history of Earth is full of 
secessions that did work. So is the 
history of Interstellar Man. The Em- 
pire of Waverley, for example. The 
Duchy of Waldegren, for another, al- 
though that’s one that should have 
come to grief. We should all of us 
be a great deal happier if it had.” 
“Federation policy . .” he be- 
gan. 

“Policy, shmolicy! Don’t let’s be 
unkind to the Waldegrenese, because 
as long as they’re in being they exer- 
cise a restraining influence upon the 
Empire of Waverley and those bol- 
shy-minded Rim Worlds . .” Her 
pace slackened. Grimes noticed that 
they were passing through the alley- 
way in which she and her staff were 
accommodated. She went on, “But all 
this talking politics is thirsty work. 
Come in for a couple of drinks.” 
“Thank you. But, Jane . .” (she 
didn’t seem to have noticed the use 
of her given name) “. I don’t 
think that either of us is qualified 
to criticize the handling of foreign 
and colonial affairs.” 



“Spoken like a nice, young, well- 
drug-up future admiral. Oh, I know, 
I know. You people are trained to 
be the musclemen of the Federa- 
tion. Yours’s not to reason why, 
yours’s but to do and die, and all 
the rest of it. But I’m a Rim World- 
er, and out on the Rim you learn to 
think for yourself.” She slid her door 
open. “Come on in. This is Liberty 
Hall — you can spit on the mat and 
call the cat a bastard.” 

H er accommodation was a suite 
rather than a mere cabin. It 
was neither as large nor as well fitted 
as the captain’s, but it was better 
than the chief officer’s quarters, in 
which Grimes had already been a 
guest. 

He looked with interest at the 
holograms on the bulkhead of the 
sitting room. They were — but in an 
altogether different way — as eye- 
catching as Captain Craven’s had 
been. There was one that was almost 
physically chilling, that induced the 
feeling of utter cold and darkness 
and loneliness. It was of the night 
sky on some planet, a range of dimly 
seen yet sharply serrated peaks bi- 
secting a great, pallidly glowing, 
lenticulate nebula. “Home, sweet 
home,” murmured the girl, seeing 
what he was looking at. “The Desola- 
tion Mountains on Faraway, with the 
Galactic Lens visible in the back- 
ground.” 

“And you feel homesick for that?** 
“Too right I do. Oh, not all the 
time. I like warmth and comfort as 
well as the next woman. But . : 

She laughed. “Don’t stand atround 
gawking — you make the place look 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



25 




untidy. Pull yourself into a chair 
and belay the buttocks.” 

He did so, watching her as she 
busied herself at the liquor cabinet. 
Suddenly, in these conditions of pri- 
vacy, he was acutely conscious of the 
womanliness of her. The rather tight 
and rather short shorts, as she bent 
away from him, left very little to 
the imagination. And her legs, al- 
though slender, were full Where they 
should be full, with the muscles 
working smoothly under the golden 
skin. He felt the urge which he stern- 
ly suppressed to plant a kiss in the 
delectable hollow behind each knee. 
She turned suddenly. “Here! Catch!” 
He managed to grab the bulb that 
was hurtling toward his face, but 
a little of the wine spurted from the 
nipple and struck him in the right 
eye. When his vision cleared he saw 
that she was seated opposite him, 
was laughing (at or with him?). 
“At,” he suspected. A real demon- 
stration of sympathy would have 
consisted of tears, not laughter. Her 
face grew momentarily severe. “Not 
the mess,” she said reprovingly. 
“But the waste.” 

Grimes examined the bulb. “I 
didn’t waste much. Only an eyeful.” 

She raised her drink in ritual greet- 
ing. “Here’s mud in your eye,” ad- 
ding, “for a change.” 

In the sudden silence that follow- 
ed they sat looking at each other. 
There was a tension, some odd re- 
sultant of centrifugal and centripetal 
forces. They were on the brink of 
something, and both of them knew 
it, and there was the compulsion to 
go forward countered by the urge to 
go back. 



She asked tartly, “Have you never 
seen a woman’s legs before?” 

He shifted his regard to her face, 
to the eyes that, somehow, were 
brown no longer, but held the depth 
and the darkness of the night 
through which the ship was plung- 
ing. 

She said, “I think you’d better 
finish your drink and go.” 

He said, “Perhaps you’re right.” 
“Too bloody right I’m right.” She 
managed a smile. “I’m not an idler, 
like some people. I’ve work to do.” 
“See you at lunch, then. And 
thank you.” 

“Don’t thank me. It was on the 
house, as the little dog said. Off with 
you. Admiral.” 

He unbuckled his lapstrap, got out 
of the chair and made his way to 
the door. When he was out of her 
room, he did not go to his own 
cabin but to the bar, where he join- 
ed the Baxters. They, rather to his 
surprise, greeted him in a friendly 
manner. Rim Worlders, Grimes de- 
cided, had their good points. 

I t was after lunch when one of the 
purserettes told him that the cap- 
tain wished to see him. What have I 
done now? wondered Grimes, and he 
answered his own question with the 
words. Nothing. Unfortunately. 

Craven’s manner, when he ad- 
mitted Grimes into his dayroom, was 
severe. “Come in, Ensign. Be seat- 
ed.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“You may smoke if you wish.” 
“Thank you, sir.” 

Grimes filled and lit his pipe, the 
captain ignited one of his pungent

IF 




cigars, studied the eddying coils of 
smoke as though they were writing 
a vitally important message in some 
strange language. 

“Er, Mr. Grimes, I believe that 
you have been seeing a great deal of 
my purser, Miss Pentecost.” 

“Not a great deal, sir. I’m at her 
table, of course.” 

“I am told that she has entertain- 
ed you in her quarters.” 

“Just one bulb of sherry, sir. I 
had no idea that we were breaking 
ship’s regulations.” 

“You were not. All the same, Mr. 
Grimes, I have to warn you.” 

“I assure you, sir, that nothing 
occurred between us.” 

Craven permitted himself a brief, 
cold smile. “A ship is not a Sunday 
School outing — especially a ship 
under my command. Some masters, 
I know, do expect their officers to 
comport themselves like Sunday 
School pupils, with the captain as the 
principal; but / expect my senior of- 
ficers to behave like intelligent and 
responsible adults. Miss Pentecost is 
quite capable of looking after herself. 
It is you that I’m worried about.” 
“There’s no need to be worried, 
sir.” 

The captain laughed. “I’m not 
worried about your morals, Mr. 
Grimes. In fact, I have formed the 
opinion that a roll in the hay would 
do you far more good than harm. 
But Miss Pentecost is a dangerous 
woman. Before lifting ship, very 
shortly before lifting ship, I received 
a confidential report concerning her 
activities. She’s an efficient purser, 
a highly efficient purser, in fact, but 
she’s even more than that. Much 



more.” Again he studied the smoke 
from his cigar. “Uinfortuinaitely 
there’s no real proof, otherwise she’d 
not be sailing with us. Had I in- 
sisted upon her discharge, I’d have 
been up against the Interstellar 
Clerical and Supply Officers’ Guild.” 
“Surely not,” murmured Grimes. 
Craven snorted. “You people are 
lucky. You haven’t a mess of Guilds 
to deal with, each and every one of 
which is all too ready to rush to the 
defense of a Guild member, no mat- 
ter what he or she is supposed to 
have done. As a Survey Service 
captain you’U never have to face a 
suit for wrongful dismissal. You’ll 
never be accused of victimization.” 
“But what has Miss Pentecost 
done, sir?” asked Grimes. 

“Nothing — or too bloody much. 
You know where she comes from, 
don’t you? The Rim Worlds. The 
planets of the misfits, the rebels, the 
noncomformists. There’s been talk of 
secession of late, but even those ir- 
responsible anarchists know bloody 
well that secession will never succeed 
unless they build up their own space 
power. There’s the Duchy of Walde- 
gren, which would pounce as soon as 
the Federation withdrew its protec- 
tion. And even the Empire of Waver- 
ley might be tempted to extend its 
boundaries. So . 

“They have a merchant fleet of 
sorts, these Rim Worlders. The Sun- 
downer Line. I’ve heard rumors that 
it’s about to be nationalized. But 
they have no fighting navy.” 

“But what’s all this to do with 
Miss Pentecost, sir?” 

“If what’s more than just hinted 
at in that confidential report is true 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



27 





— plenty. She’s a recruiting ser- 
geant, no less. Any officer with 
whom she’s shipmates who’s dis- 
gruntled, on the verge of throwing 
his hand in — or on the verge of 
being emptied out — she’ll turn on 
the womanly sympathy for and tell 
him that there’ll always be a job 
waiting out on the Rim, that the 
Sundowner Line is shortly going to 
expand, so there’ll be quick promo- 
tion and all the rest of it.” 

“And what’s that to do with me, 
Captain?” 

“Are all Survey Service ensigns 
as innocent as you, Mr. Grimes? 
Merchant officers the Rim Worlds 
want, and badly. Naval officers they 
want, and badly. Naval officers 
they’ll want even worse once the 
balloon goes up.” 

Grimes permitted himself a su- 
perior smile. “It’s extremely unlike- 
ly, sir, that I shall ever want to 
leave the Survey Service.” 

“Unlikely perhaps — but not im- 
possible. So bear in mind what I’ve 
told you. I think that you’fl be able 
to look after yourself now that you 
know the score.” 

“I think so too,” Grimes told him 
firmly. He thought. The old man*s 
been reading too many spy stories, 

VII 

r iey were dancing. 

Tables and chairs had been 
cleared from the ship’s saloon and 
from the big, ornate playmaster 
throbbed the music of an orchestra 
so famous that even Grimes had 
heard of it — The Singing Drums. 
They were dancing. 

IF 




Some couples shuffled a sedate 
measure, never losing the contact 
between their magnetically shod feet 
and the polished deck. Others — 
daring or foolhardy — cavorted in 
Null-G, gambolled fantastically but 
rarely gracefully in Free Fall. 

They were dancing. 

Ensign Grimes was trying to 
dance. 

It was not the fault of his partner 
that he was making such a sorry 
mess of it. She, Jane Pentecost, 
proved the truth of the oft-made 
statement that spacemen and space- 
women are expert at this form of 
exercise. He, John Grimes, was the 
exception that proves the rule. He 
was sweating, and his feet felt at 
least six times their normal size. 
Only the fact that he was holding 
Jane, and closely, saved him from 
absolute misery. 

There was a pause in the music. 
As it resumed Jane said, “Let’s sit 
this one out. Admiral.” 

“If you wish to,” he replied, try- 
ing not to sound too grateful. 

“Too right I wish to. I don’t mind 
losing a little toenail varnish, but I 
think we’ll call it a day while I still 
have a full set of toenails.” 

“I’m sorry,” he said. 

“So am I.” But the flicker of a 
smile robbed the words of their sting. 

She led the way to the bar. It 
was deserted save for the bored and 
sulky girl behind the gleaming coun- 
ter. “All right. Sue,” Jane told her. 
“You can join the revels. The ad- 
miral and I will mind the shop.” 

*'Thank you. Miss Pentecost.” Sue 
let herself out from her little cage, 
vanished gracefully and rapidly in 



the direction of the salon. Jane took 
her place. 

“I like being a barmaid,” she told 
the ensign, taking two frosted bulbs 
out of the cooler. 

“I’ll sign for these,” offered 
Grimes. 

“You will not. This comes under 
the heading of entertaining influen- 
tial customers.” 

“But I’m not. Influential, I mean.” 

“But you will be.” She went on 
dreamily, “I can see it. I can just 
see it. The poor old Delia 0*Ryan, 
even more decrepit than she is now, 
and her poor old purser, about to 
undergo a Fate Worse Than at the 
hands of bloody pirates from the 
next galaxy, but three . But all is 
not lost. There, light-years distant, 
is big, fat. Grand Admiral Grimes 
aboard his flagship, busting a gut, to 
say nothing of his Mannschenn 
Drive unit, to rush to the rescue of 
his erstwhile girl friend. ‘Dammitall,’ 
I can hear him muttering into his 
beard. ‘Dammitall. That girl used to 
give me free drinks when I was a 
snotty nosed ensign. I will repay. 
Full speed ahead, Gridley, and damn 
the torpedoes!’ ” 

' Grimes laughed, then asked sharp- 
ly, “Admiral in which service?” 

“What do you mean, John?” She 
eyed him warily. 

“Tom know what I mean.” 

“So . she murmured. “So . 
I know that you had another home 
truth session with the Bearded Bas- 
tard. I can guess what it was about.” 

“And is it true?” demanded 
Grimes. 

“Am I Olga Popovsky, the beau- 
tiful spy? Is that what you mean?” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



29 




“More or less.” 

“Come off it, John. How die hell 
cm I be a secret agent for a non- 
existent government?” 

“You can be a secret agent for a 
subversive organization.” 

“What is this? Is it a hangover 
from some half-baked and half-un- 
derstood course in counter-espion- 
age?” 

“There was a course of sorts,” he 
admitted. “I didn’t take much inter- 
est in it. At the time.” 

“And now you wish that you had. 
Poor John.” 

“But it wasn’t espionage that the 
Old Man had against you. He had 
some sort of story about your acting 
as a sort of recruiting sergeant, lur- 
ing officers away from the Commis- 
sion’s ships to that crumby little 
rabble of star tramps calling itself 
the Sundowner Line . .” 

S he didn’t seem to be listening to 
him, was giving her attention in- 
stead to the music that drifted from 
the saloon. It was one of the old, 
twentieth-century melodies that was 
enjoying a revival. She began to sing 
in time to it: 

Good-by, Vll run 
To seek another sun 
Where I 
May find 

There are^ hearts more kind than 
the ones left behind . 

She smiled sombrely and asked, 
“Does that answer your questions?” 
“Don’t talk in riddles,” he said 
roughly. 

“Riddles? Perhaps — but not very 
hard ones. That, John, is a sort of 
song of farewell from a very old 



comic opera. As I recall it, the bloke 
singing it was going to shoot through 
and join the French Foreign Legion. 
(But there’s no French Foreign 
Legion any more . .) We, out on 
the Rim, have tacked our own words 
on to it. It’s become almost a na- 
tional anthem to the Rim Runners, 
as the people who man our ships — 
such as they are — are already call- 
ing themselves. 

“There’s no French Foreign Le- 
gion any more, but the misfits and 
the failures have to have somewhere 
to go. I haven’t lured anybody away 
from this service, but now and again 
I’ve shipped with officers who’ve 
been on the point of getting out, 
or being emptied out, and when 
they’ve cried into my beer I’ve given 
them advice. Of course. I’ve a cer- 
tain natural bias in favor of my own 
home world. If I were Sirian born 
I’d be singing the praises of the Dog 
Star Line.” 

“Even so,” he persisted, “your 
conduct seems to have been some- 
what suspect.” 

“Has it? And how? To begin with, 
you are not an officer in this em- 
ploy. And if you were, I should 
challenge you to find anything in 
the Commission’s regulations for- 
bidding me to act as I have been 
doing.” 

“Captain Craven warned me,” 
said Grimes. 

“Did he, now? That’s his privilege. 
I suppose ithat he thinks that it’s 
also his duty. I suppose he has the 
idea that I offer^ you admiral’s 
rank in the Rim Worlds Navy as 
soon as we secede. If we had our 
own navy, which we don’t, we might

just take you in as ensign, acting, 
probationary,” 

“Thank you.” 

S he put her elbows on the bar 
counter, propping her face be- 
tween her hands, somehow convey- 
ing the illusion of gravitational pull, 
looking up at him. 

“I’ll be frank with you, John. I 
admit that we do take the no-hopers, 
the drunks and the drifters into our 
merchant fleet. I know far better 
than you what a helluva difference 
there is between those rustbuckets 
and the well found, well run ships 
of the Commission and, come to that, 
Trans-Galactic Clippers and Waver- 
ly Royal Mail. But when we do 
start some kind of a navy we shall 
want better material. Much better. 
We shall want highly competent of- 
ficers who yet, somehow, will have 
the Rim World outlook. The first 
batch, of course, will have to be out- 
siders, to tide us over until our own 
training program is well under way.” 
“And I don’t qualify?” he asked 
stiffly. 

“Frankly, no. I’ve been watching 
you. You’re too much of a stickler 
for rules and regulations, especially 
the more stupid ones. Look at the 
wiay ybu’re dressed now, for exam- 
ple. Evening wear, civilian, junior 
officers for the use of. No in- 
dividuality. You might as well be in 
uniform. Better, in fact. There’d be 
some touch of brightness.” 

“Go on.” 

“And the way you comport your- 
self with women. Stiff. Starchy. Cor- 
rect. And you’re all too conscious 
of the fact that I, even though I’m 



a mere merchant officer, and cleri- 
cal branch at that, put up more gold 
braid than you do. I noticed that es- 
pecially when we were dancing, I 
was having to lead all the time.” 

He said defensively, “I’m not' a 
very good dancer.” 

“You can say that again.” She 
smiled briefly. “So there you have 
it, John. You can tell the Bearded 
Bastard, when you see him again, 
that you’re quite safe from my wiles. 
I’ve no doubt that you’ll go far in 
your own Service, but you just aren’t 
Rim Worlds material.” 

“I shouldn’t have felt all that 
flattered if you’d said that I was,” 
he told her bluntly; but he knew 
that he was lying. 

VIII 

^i'^l^es?” Jane was saying. “Yes, 
I Mr. Letoumeau?” 

Grimes realized that she was not 
looking at him, that she was looking 
past him and addressing a newcomer. 
He tqrned around to see who it was. 
He found — somehow the name 
hadn’t registered — that it was the 
psionic radio officer, a tall, pale, 
untidily put together young man in 
a slovenly uniform. He looked 
scared; but that was his habitual ex- 
pression, Grimes remembered. They 
were an odd breed, these trained 
telepaths with their Rhine Institute 
diplomas; and they were not popular, 
but they were the only means where- 
by ships and shore stations could 
communicate instantaneously over 
the long light-years. In the Survey 
Service they were referred to, slight- 
ingly, as Commissioned Tea Cup

Readers. In the Survey Service and 
in the Merchant Service they were 
referred to as Snoopers. But they 
were a very necessary evil. 

“Yes, Mr. Letourneau?” 

“Where’s the old man? He’s not 
in his quarters.” 

“The Master — ” Jane empha- 
sized the title “ — is in the saloon.” 
Then, a little maliciously, “Couldn’t 
you have used your crystal ball?” 
Letourneau flushed. “You know 
very well, Miss Pentecost, that we 
have to take an oath that we will 
always respect the mental privacy 
of our shipmates. But I must find 
him. Quicldy.” 

“Help yourself. He’s treading the 
light fantastic in there.” When he 
was gone she said, “Typical. Just 
typical. If it were a real emergency, 
he could get B.B. on the intercom. 
But no. Not him. He has to parade 
his distrust of anything electronic 
and, at the same time, make it quite 
clear that he’s not breaking his pre- 
cious oath. Tell me, how do you 
people handle your spaceborne es- 
pers?” 

He grinned. “We’ve still one big 
stick that you people haven’t. A 
court martial followed by a firing 
party. Not that I’ve ever seen it 
used.” 

“Hardly, considering that you’ve 
only been in space a dog watch.” 
Her face froze suddenly. “Yes, Sue?” 
It was the girl whom Jane had 
relived in the bar. “Miss Pentecost, 
will you report to the captain in 
Control, please. At once.” 

“What have I done now?” 

“It’s some sort of emergency. 
Miss Pentecost. The chief officer’s 



up there with him, and he’s sent for 
the doctor and the two chief en- 
gineers.” 

“Then I must away, John. Look 
after the bar again. Sue. Don’t let 
the admiral have too many free 
drinks.” 

S he moved fast and gracefully, 
was gone before Grimes could 
think of any suitable repartee. He 
said to the girl, “What is happening, 
Sue?” 

“I don’t know. Ad . .” She flush- 
ed. “Sorry. Ensign. And, in any 
case. I’m not supposed to talk to 
the passengers about it.” 

“But I’m not a real passenger,” 
he said — and asked himself. Am 
I a real anything? 

“No, I suppose you’re not, Mr. 
Grimes. But you’re not on duty.” 
“An officer of the Survey Ser- 
vice is always on duty,” he told her, 
with some degree of truth. “What- 
ever happens on the spacelanes is 
our concern.” It sounded good. 

“Yes,” she agreed hesitantly. 
“That’s what my fianc — he’s a 
Lieutenant J.G. — is always telling 
me.” 

“So what’s all the flap about?” 
“Promise not to tell anybody.” 
“Of course.” 

“Mr. Letourneau came wandering 
into the saloon. He just stood there 
staring about, the way he does, then 
he spotted the captain. He was ac- 
tually dancing with me at the time.” 
She smiled reminiscently and added, 
“He’s a very good dancer.” 

“He would be. But go on.” 

“He came charging across the 
dance floor — Mr. Letourneau, I

mean. He didn’t care whose toes he 
trod on or who he tripped over. I 
couldn’t help overhearing when he 
started babbling away to Captain 
Craven. It’s a distress call. From 
one of our ships — Epsilon Sex- 
tans*^ Her voice dropped to a whis- 
per. “And it’s piracy.” 

“Piracy? Impossible.” 

“But, Mr. Grimes, it’s what he 
said.” 

“Psionic radio officers have been 
known to go ’round the bend before 
now,” Grimes told her, “and to send 
false alarm calls. And to receive non- 
existent ones.” 

“But the Sexy Eppy — sorry. 
Epsilon Sextans — has a cargo that’d 
be worth pirating. Or so I heard. 
The first big shipment of Antigeriat- 
ridine to Waverley.” 

Antigeiiatridine, the so-called Im- 
mortality Serum. Manufactured in 
limited, but increasing quantities 
only on Marina (often call^ by its 
colonists Submarina) a cold, unpleas- 
antly watery world in orbit about 
Alpha Crucis. The fishlike creatures 
from which ±e drug was obtained 
bred and flourished only in the seas 
of their own world. 

But piracy . 

But the old legends were full of 
stories of men who had sold their 
souls for eternal youth. 

The telephone behind the bar 
buzzed" sharply. Sue answered it. She 
said, “It’s for you, Mr. Grimes.” 
Grimes took ^e instrument. “That 
you. Ensign?” It was Captain Cra- 
ven’s voice. “Thought I’d find you 
there. Come up to Control, will you?” 
It was an order rather than a re- 
quest. 



A ll the ship’s executive officers 
were in the Control Room, and 
the doctor, the purser and the two 
chiel engineers. As Grimes emerged 
from the hatch he heard Kennedy, 
the Mate, say, “Here’s the Ensign 
now.” 

“Good. Then dog down, Mr. Ken- 
nedy, so we get some privacy.” 
Craven turned to Grimes. “You’re 
on the active list of the Survey Ser- 
vice, Mister, so I suppose you’re en- 
titled to know what’s going on. The 
situation is this. Epsilon Sextans, 
Marina to Waverly with a slupaaent 
of Antigeriatridine, has beem pi- 
rated.” Grimes managed, wilt an 
effort, to refrain from saying, “I 
know”. Craven went on. Grimes 
managed, with an effort, to refi^n 
from saying, “I know”. Craven went 
on, “Her esper is among the survi- 
vors. He says that the pirates were 
two frigates of the Waldegren Navy. 
Anyhow, the Interstellar Drive en- 
gineers aboard Epsilon Sextans man- 
aged to put their box of tricks on 
random precession, and they got 
away. But not in one piece.” 

“Not in one piece?” echoed 
Grimes stupidly. 

“What the hell do you expect 
when an unarmed merchantman is 
fired upon, without warning, by two 
warships? The esper says that their 
Control has had it, and all the ac- 
commodation spaces. By some mi- 
racle the psionic radio officer’s shack 
wasn’t holed, and neither was the 
Mannschenn Drive Room.” 

“But even one missile . .” mut- 
tered Grimes. 

“If you want to capture a ship 
and her cargo more or less intact,” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



33 




snapped Craven, “you don’t use 
missdes. You use the laser. It’s 
an ideal weapon if you aren’t fussy 
about how many people you kill.” 

“Knowing the Waldegrenese as we 
do,” said Jane Pentecost bitterly, 
“there wouldn’t have been any sur- 
vivors anyhow.” 

“Be quiet!” roared Craven. 
Grimes wias puzzled by his outburst. 
It was out of character. True, he 
could hardly expect a shipmaster to 
react to the news of a vicious piracy 
with equanimity; but this shipmaster 
was an officer of the Reserve, had 
seen service in warships and had been 
highly decorated for outstanding 
bravery in battle. 

Craven had control of himself 
again. “The situation is this. There 
are people still living aboard Epsilon 
Sextans. Even though all her naviga- 
tors have been killed, I think that I 
shall be able to find her in time. 
Further more, she has a very valu- 
able cargo and, in any case, cannot 
be written off as a total loss. There 
is little damage that cannot be re- 
paired by welded patches. I have al- 
ready sent a message to Head Office 
requesting a free hand. I have sal- 
vage in mind. I see no reason why 
the ship and her cargo should not 
be taken on to Waverley.” 

“A prize crew, sir?” 

“If you care to put it that way. 
This will mean cutting down the 
number of officers aboard my own 
vessel; but I am sure, Mr. Grimes, 
that you will be willing to gain some 
practical watch-keeping experience. 
All that’s required is your autograph 
on the ship’s Articles of Agreement. 

“lhank you, sir.” 



“Don’t thahk me. 1 may be thank- 
ing you before the job’s over and 
done.” He turned to his Chief Of- 
ficer. “Mr. Kennedy, keep in touch 
with Mr. Letoumeau and let me 
know if anything further comes 
through either from Epsilon Sextans 
or from Head Office. The rest of 
you — keep this to yourselves. No 
sense in alarming the passengers. 
I’m sure that the doctor and Miss 
Pentecost between them can concoct 
some soothing story to account for 
this officers’ conference.” 

“Captain Craven,” said Jane 
Pentecost. 

“Well?” 

“The other man at my table. Mr. 
Baxter. I knew him out on the Rim. 
He holds Chief Reaction Drive En- 
gineer’s papers.” 

“Don’t tell him anything yet. But 
I’ll keep him in mind. Now, Mr. 
Grimes, will you join me in my day 
cabin?” 

DC 

T he holograms were all gone from 
the bulkheads of Captain Cra- 
ven’s cabin. To replace them there 
was just one picture: a woman, not 
young, but with the facial bon^ struc- 
ture that defies age and time. She 
was in uniform, and on her shoulder- 
boards were the two and a half 
stripes of Senior Purser. The ship- 
master noticed Grimes’ interest and 
said briefly and bitterly, “She was 
too senior for an Epsilon Class ship; 
but she cut her leave short, just to 
oblige, when the regular purser went 
sick. She should have been back on 
Earth at the same time as me.

IF 




though. Then we were going to get 
married . 

Grimes said nothing. He thought, 
Too senior for an Epsilon Class 
ship? Epsilon Sextans, for example? 
What could he say? 

“And that,” said Craven savage- 
ly, “wflj that.” 

“Fm sorry, sir,” blurted Grimes, 
conscious of the inadequacy of his 
words. Then, foolishly, “But there 
are survivors, sir.” 

“Don’t you think that I haven’t 
got Letourneau and his opposite 
number to check? And have you 
ever seen the aftermath of a Deep 
Space battle. Mister? Have you ever 
boarded a ship that’s been slashed 
and stabbed to death with laser 
beams?” He seemed to require no 
answer, pulled himself into the chair 
by his desk, strapped himself in. He 
motioned to Grimes to be seated. 
Then he pulled out from a drawer a 
large sheet of paper, which he un- 
folded. It was a cargo plan. “Cur- 
rent voyage,” he grunted. “And 
we’re carrying more to Lindisfarne 
than one brand new ensign.” 

“Such as, sir?” ventured Grimes. 
“Naval stores. I don’t mind ad- 
mitting that I’m more than a little 
rusty insofar as Survey Service pro- 
cedure is concerned, even though I 
still hold my Reserve Commission. 
You’re more familiar with fancy ab- 
breviations than I am. Twenty cases 
RERAT, for example . .” 

“Reserve rations, sir. Canned and 
deydrated.” 

“9ood. And ATREG?” 
“Atmospheric regeneration units, 
complete.” •> 

“So is Epsilon Sextans' ‘farm’ has 



been killed we shall be able to man- 
age?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Do you think you’d be able to 
install an Atreg unit?” 

“Of course, sir. They’re very sim- 
ple, as you know. Just sy^etic 
chlorophyl and a UV source. In 
any case, there are full instructions 
inside every container.” 

“And this? A double M. Mark 
XV?” 

“Anti-Missile Missile.” 

“And ALGE?” 

“Anti-Laser Gas Emitter.” 

“The things they do think of. I 
feel more at home with these 
AVM’s, although I see that they’ve 
got as far as Mark XVII now.” 
“Anti-Vessel Missiles,” said 
Grimes. A slight enthusiasm crept 
into his voice. “The XVII’s a real 
honey.” 

“What does it do?” 

“I’m sorry, sir. Even though you 
are a Reserve Officer, I can’t tell 
you.” 

“But they’re effective?” 

“Yes. Very.” 

“And I think you’re Gunnery 
Branch, Mr. Grimes, aren’t you?” 

“I am, sir.” He added hastily, 
“But I’m still quite capable of carry- 
ing out a watch officer’s duties 
aboard this vessel should the need 
arise.” 

“The main thing is you’re familiar 
with naval stores and equipment. 
When we find and board Epsilon 
Sextans, I shall be transhipping cer- 
tain items of cargo.” 

“Rerat and Atreg, sir?” 

“Yes. And the others.” 

“But, sir. I can’t allow it. Not

unless I have authority from the 
Flag Officer Commanding Lindis- 
fame Base. As soon as your Mr. 
Letoumeau can be spared, I’ll get 
him to try and raise the station 
there.” 

“I’m afraid that’s out of the ques- 
tion, Mr. Grimes. In view of the rath- 
er peculiar political situation, I 
think that the answer would be ‘No.’ 
Even if it were ‘Yes,’ you know as 
well as I how sluggishly the tide 
flows through official channels. Fur- 
thermore, just in case it has escaped 
your notice, / am the master.” 

“And I, sir, represent the Survey 
Service. As the only commissioned 
officer aboard this vessel / am re- 
sponsible for Survey Service cargo.” 
“As a Reserve Officer, Mr. 
Grimes, I rank you.” 

“Only when you have been recall- 
ed to Active Service. Sir.” 

C raven said, “I was rather afraid 
that you’d take this attitude. 
That’s why I decided to get this in- 
terview over and done with, just so 
we all know where we stand.” He 
put aiway the cargo plan, swivelled 
his chair so that he could reach out 
to his liquor cabinet. He pulled out 
two bulbs, tossed one to Grimes. 
“No toasts. If we drank to law and 
order we should mean different 
things. So just drink. And listen. 

‘To begin with, Epsilon Sextans 
doesn’t know where she is. But 
Letoumeau is one of the rare tele- 
paths with the direction finding ta- 
lent, and as soon as he’s able to 
get lined-up we shall alter course to 
home on the wreck. That’s what he’s 
trying to do now. 



“When we find her, we shall syn- 
chronize and board, of course. The 
first thing will be medical aid to the 
survivors. Then we patch the ship 
up. And then we arm her. And then, 
with a prize crew under myself, we 
put ourselves on the trajectory for 
Waverley, hoping that those Walde- 
grenese frigates come back for an- 
other nibble.” 

“They’d never dare, sir.” 

“Wouldn’t they? The original pi- 
racy they’ll try to laugh off by saying 
that it was by real pirates — no, 
that’s not quite right, but you know 
what I mean — wearing Waldegren 
colors. The second piracy, they’ll 
make sure that there are no survi- 
vors.” 

“But I Still can’t see how they 
can hope to get away with it. It’s 
always been an accepted fact that 
the main weapon against piracy has 
been psionic radio.” 

“And so ,it was — until some 
genius developed a jamming techni- 
que. Epsilon Sextans wasn’t able to 
get any messages out until her crazy 
random precession pulled her well 
clear.” 

“And you hope, sir, that they do 
attack you?” 

“I do, Mr. Grimes. I had hoped 
that I should have a good gunnery 
officer under me, but . .” he 
shrugged his massive shoulders “. 
I think that I shall be able to man- 
age.” 

“And you hope that you’ll have 
your weapons,” persisted Grimes. 

“I see no reason why I should not. 

Ensign.” 

“There is #ne very good reason, 
sir. That is that I, a commissioned 



36 



IF 




officer of the Survey Service, am 
aboard your vessel. I insist tihat you* 
leave the tracking down and des- 
truction of the pirates to the proper 
authorities. I insist, too, that no Sur- 
vey Service stores be discharged 
from this ship without my written 
authority.” 

F or the first time the hint of a 
smile relieved the somberness 
of Craven’s face. “And to think that 
I believed that Jane Pentecost could 
recruit yoM,” he murmured. Then, 
in a louder voice, “And what if I 
just go ahead without your written 
authority. Ensign?” 

Grimes had the answer ready. 
“Then, sir, I shall be obliged to or- 
der your officers not to obey your 
unlawful commands. If necessary, I 
shall call upon the male passengers 
to assist me in any action that is 
necessary.” 

Craven’s bushy eyebrows went up 
and stayed up. “Mr. Grimes,” he 
said in a gritty voice, “it is indeed 
lucky for you that I have first hand 
experience of the typical Survey Ser- 
vice mentality. Some masters I know 
would, in these circumstances, send 
you out on a spacewalk without a 
suit. But before I take drastic action. 
I’ll give you one more chance to 
cooperate.” His tone softened. “You 
noticed the portrait I’ve put up in- 
stead of all the temporary pepsies. 
Every man, no matter how much he 
plays around, has one woman who 
is the woman. Gillian was the 
woman as far as I was concerned — 
as far as I am concerned. I’ve a 
chance to bring her murderers under 
my guns, and, by God, I’m taking 



that chance, no matter what it means 
either to my career or to the some- 
what odd foreign policy of the 
Federation. I used to be annoyed by 
Jane Pentecost’s outbursts on that 
subject — but now I see that she’s 
right. And she’s right, too, when it 
comes to the Survey Service’s re- 
luctance to take action against 
Waldegren. 

“So I, Mr. Grimes, am taking ac- 
tion.” 

“Sir, I forbid you . 

“Tom forbid me? Ensign, you for- 
get yourself. Perhaps this will help 
you remember.” 

This was a Minetti automatic that 
had appeared suddenly in the cap- 
tain’s hand. In his hairy fist the 
little, glittering weapon looked no 
more than a toy; but Grimes knew 
his firearms, knew that at the slight- 
est pressure of Craven’s finger the 
needlelike projectiles would stitch 
him from crown to crotch. 

“I’m sorry about this, Mr. 
Grimes.” As he spoke. Craven press- 
ed a button set in his desk with his 
free hand. “I’m sorry about this. But 
I realize that I was expecting rather 
too much of you. After all, you have 
your career to consider. Time was,” 
he went on, “when a naval officer 
could put his telescope to his blind 
eye as an excuse for ignoring orders 
and get away with it. But the poli- 
ticians had less power in those days. 
We’ve come a long way — and a 
wrong way — since Nelson.” 

Grimes heard the door behind him 
slide open. He didn’t bother to look 
around, not even when hard hands 
were laid on his shoulders. 

“Mr. Kennedy,” said Craven, 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM

“things turned out as I feared that 
they would. Will you and Mr. Lu- 
dovic take the Ensign along to the 
Detention Cell?” 

“I’ll see you on itrial for piracy. 
Captain!” flared Grimes. 

“An interesting legal point, En- 
sign — especially since you are be- 
ing entered in my Official Log as a 
mutineer.” 

X 

T he detention cell was not un- 
comfortable, but it was depress- 
ing. 

It was a padded cell — passengers 
in spacecraft have been known to 
exhibit the more violent symptoms 
of mania — which detracted from 
its already inconsiderable cheerful- 
ness if not from its comfort. How- 
ever, Grimes was not mad — not in 
the medical sense, that is — and so 
was considered able to attend to his 
own bodily needs. The little toilet 
was open to him, and at regular in- 
tervals a bell would sound and a 
container of food would appear in 
a hatch recessed into the bulkhead 
of the living cabin. There was read- 
ing matter too, such as it was. The 
ensign suspected that Jane Pentecost 
was the donor. It consisted of 
pamphlets published by some or- 
ganization calling itself The Rim 
Worlds Secessionist Party. The al- 
most hysterical calls to arms were 
bad enough, but the ones consisting 
mainly of columns of statistics were 
worse. Economics had never been 
Grimes’ strong point. 

He slept, he fed at the appointed 
times, he made a lengthy ritual of 



keeping himself clean, he tried to 
read; and, all the time, with only 
sounds and sensations as clues, he 
endeavored to maintain a running 
plot of the ship’s maneuvers. 

Quite early there had been the 
shutting down of the Mannschenn 
Drive and the consequent fleeting 
sensation of temporal disorientation. 
This had been followed by the ac- 
celeration warning — the cell had 
an intercom speaker recessed in the 
padding — and Grimes, although it 
seemed rather pointless in bis sponge- 
rubber environment, had strapped 
himself into his couch. He heard the 
directional gyroscopes start up, felt 
the effects of centrifugal force as 
the ship came round to her new 
heading. Then there was the pseudo- 
gravity of acceleration, accompanied 
by the muffled thunder of the re- 
action drive. It was obvious, thought 
the ensign, that Captain Craven was 
expending his reaction mass in a 
manner that, in other circumstances, 
would have been considered reck- 
less. 

Suddenly, silence and Free Fall, 
and almost immediately the off-key 
keening of the Mannschenn Drive. 
Its note was higher, much higher, 
than Grimes remembered it; and 
the queasy feeling of temporal dis- 
orientation lasted much longer than 
it had on previous occasions. 

And that, for a long time, was all. 

M eals came and were eaten. 

Every morning, according to 
his watch, the prisoner showered and 
applied depilatory cream to his face. 
He tried to exercise; but to exer- 
cise in a padded cell, with no ap- 



38 



IF 




paratus, in Free Fall, is hard. He 
tried to read, but the literature avail- 
able was hardly more interesting to 
him than a telephone directory 
would have been. And, even though 
he never had been gregarious, the 
lack of anybody to talk to was wear- 
ing him down. 

It was a welcome break from the 
monotony when he realized that, 
once again, the ship was maneuver- 
ing. This time there was no use of 
the directional gyroscopes, there 
were no rocket blasts, but there was 
a variation of the whine of the 
Drive as it hunted, hunted, as the 
temporal precession rate was adjust- 
ed by tens of seconds, by seconds, 
by microseconds. 

And then it locked. 

The ship shuddered slightly — 
once, twice. 

Grimes envisaged the firing of the 
two mooring rockets, one from the 
bow and one from the stern, each 
with the powerful electromagnet in 
its nose, each trailing its fathoms of 
fine but enormously strong cable. 
Merchant vessels, he knew, carried 
this equipment, but unlike naval 
ships rarely used it. But Craven, as 
a Reservist, would have seen and 
have taken part in enough drills. 

The ship shuddered again heavily. 

So the rendezvous had been made. 
So Delta Orionis and Epsilon Sex- 
tans, their Drives synchronized, 
bound together by the rescue ship’s 
cables, were now falling as one unit 
through the dark immensities. 

So the rendezvous had been made, 
and already the survivors of the 
wreck were being brought aboard 
the Delia 0*Ryan, were being helped 



out of their stinking spacesuits, were 
blurting out their story to Craven 
and his officers. Grimes could vis- 
ualize it all, almost as clearly as 
though he were actually watching 
it. He could visualize, too, the en- 
gineers swarming over the wreck, 
the flare of their burning and weld- 
ing torches, the cannibalizing of non- 
essential plating from the ship’s struc- 
ture for hull patches. It was all laid 
down in the Survey Service’s Dam- 
age Control Manual; and Captain 
Craven, at least, would know that 
book as thoroughly as did Grimes. 

And what of the cargo, the Sur- 
vey Service stores. Grimes* stores? A 
trembling in the ship’s structure, a 
barely felt vibration, told him that 
gantries and conveyer belts were be- 
ing brought into operation. There 
would be no great handling prob- 
lems. Lindisfarne was Delta Orionis* 
first port of call, and the Survey 
Service consignment would be top 
stowage. But there was nothing that 
Grimes could do about it — not a 
thing. In fact, he was beginning to 
doubt the legality of the stand he 
had made against the master. And 
he was the small frog in this small 
puddle, while Captain Craven had 
made it quite clear that he was the 
big frog. Grimes wished that he was 
better versed in astronautical law, 
although a professional lawyer’s 
knowledge would be of no use to him 
in his present situation. 

There was nothing that he could 
do about it. 

So, with some hazy idea that he 
might need all his strength^ both 
mental and physical, for what was 
to befall him (but what?) in the

near future, he strapped himself in- 
to his bunk, did his best to forget 
his worries in sleep. He was well 
enough acquainted with the psychiat- 
rists’ jargon to know that this was 
no more than a return to the womb 
but, before dropping off into a shal- 
low slumber, shrugged. So what? 

H e jerked into sudden wakeful- 
ness. Jane Pentecost was there 
by his bunk, looking down at him. 

“Come in,” he said. “Don’t 
bother to knock. Now you see how 
the poor live. This is Liberty Hall; 
you can spit on the mat and call the 
cat a bastard.” 

She said, “That’s not very funny.” 
“I know it’s not. Even the first 
time that I heard it aboard this blast- 
ed ship, I was able to refrain from 
rolling in the aisles.” 

She said, “There’s no need to be 
so bitchy, John.” 

“Isn’t there? Wouldn’t you be 
bitchy if you’d been thrown into this 
padded cell?” 

“I suppose I would be. But you 
asked for it, didn’t you?” 

“If doing my duty — or trying to 
do my duty — is asking for it, I sup- 
pose that I did. Well, and has our 
pirate captain cast off yet, armed 
to the teeth with the weapons he’s 
stolen?” 

“No. The weapons are still being 
mounted. But let’s not argue legali- 
ties, John. There’s not enough time. 
I ... I just wanted to say good- 
by.” 

“Good-by?” he echoed. 

“Yes. Somebody has to do the 
cooking aboard Epsilon Sextans, and 
I volunteered.” 



“You?” 

“And why the Hell not?” she 
flared.” Captain Craven has been 
pushed over to our side of the fence, 
and it’d be a bloody bad show if we 
Rim Worlders weren’t prepared to 
stand by him. Baxter’s gone across 
to take over as Reaction Drive En- 
gineer; the only survivor in that de- 
partment was the Fourth, and he’s 
only a dog watch in space.” 

“And who else?” 

“Nobody. The Sexy Eppy*s chief, 
second and third Interstellar Drive 
Engineers survived, and they’re will- 
ing — anxious, in fact, now that 
their ship’s being armed — to stay 
on. And the psionic radio officer 
came through and is staying on. All 
of our executive officers volunteer- 
ed, of course, but the old man turned 
them down. He said that, after all, 
he could not hazard the safety of 
this ship by stripping her of her 
trained personnel. Especially since 
we carry passengers.” 

“That’s his worry,” said Grimes 
without much sympathy. “But how 
does he hope to fight his ship if 
those frigates pounce again?” 

“He thinks he’ll be able to man- 
age — with remote controls for 
every weapon brought to his main 
control panel.” 

“Possible,” admitted Grimes, his 
professional interest stirred. “But not 
very efficient. In a naval action the 
captain has his hands full just hand- 
ling the ship alone, without trying 
to control her weaponry.” 

“And you’d know, of course.” 
“Yes.” 

“Yes, you’ve read the books. And 
Captain Craven commanded a light

cruiser during that trouble with the 
Dring, so he knows nothing.” 

“He still hasn’t got four hands and 
two heads.” 

“Oh, let’s Stop talking rubbish,” 
she cried. “I probably shan’t see you 
again, John and . and . Oh, 
Hell, I want to say good-by proper- 
ly, and I don’t want you to think 
too badly about either the Old Man 
or ... or myself.” 

“So what are we supposed to do 
about it?” 

“Damn you. Grimes, you snotty- 
nosed, stuck-up space puppy! Look 
after yourself!” 

S uddenly she bent down to kiss 
him. It was intended to be no 
more than a light brushing of Mps; 
but Grimes was suddenly aware, 
with his entire body, of the closeness 
of her, of the warmth and the scent 
of her, and almost without volition 
his arms went about her, drawing 
her closer still to him. She tried to 
break away, but it was only a half- 
hearted effort. He heard her mur- 
mur, in an odd, sardonic whisper, 
“Wottthehell, oh wotthehell . and 
then, “tou jours gai . 

It made no sense at the time; but, 
years later, when he made the ac- 
quaintance of the twentieth-century 
poets, he was to remember and to 
understand. 

When it was over, when, still 
clasped in each others’ arms, they 
drifted in the center of the little 
cabin, impelled here by some old 
resultant of forces, their discarded 
clothing drifting with them, veil- 
ing their perspiration-moist bodies, 
Grimes was reluctant to let her go. 

THE ROAD TO THE RIM 








Gendy, Jane tried to disengage 
hersetf. 

She whispered, “That was a warm- 
er good-by than I intended. But 
I’m not sorry. No. I’m not 
sorry . .” Then, barely audibly, 
“It was the first time for you, wasn’t 
it?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then Fin all the more glad it 
happened. But this is good-by.” 
**Nor 

“Don’t be a bloody fool, John. 
You can’t keep me here.” 

“But I can come with you.” 

She pushed him from her. Some- 
how he landed back on the bed. Be- 
fore he could bounce he automatical- 
ly snapped one of the confining 
straps about his middle. Somehow — 
she was still wearing her sandals, but 
nothing else — she finished up 
standing on the deck, held there by 
the contact between the magnetic 
soles and the ferrous fibres in the 
padding. She put out a long, grace- 
ful arm and caught her shirt. She 
said harshly, “/’m getting dressed 
and out of here. You stay put. 
Damn you^ Grimes, for thinking 
that I was trying to lure you aboard 
the Sexy Eppy with the body beauti- 
ful. I told you before that I am 
not, repeat not, Olga Popovsky, the 
beautiful spy. And I’m not a prosti- 
tute. There’s one thing I wouldn’t 
sell if I were offered the services of 
the finest gunnery officer (which 
you aren’t) in the whole bloody 
galaxy in payment!” 

“You’re beautiful when you flare 
up like that,” said Grimes sincere- 
ly. “But you’re always beautiful.” 
Then,. “Jane, I love you.” 



“Puppy love,” she sneered. “And 
I’m old enough to be your ...” A 
faint smile softened her mouth. 
“Your maiden aunt.” 

“Let me finish. All right, it’s only 
puppy love — you say. But it’s 
still love. But . .” He was extem- 
porizing, convincingly, he hoped. 
“But my real reason for wanting 
to come with you is this. I can ap- 
preciate now what Captain Craven 
lost when Epsilon Sextans was pi- 
rated. I can see — I can feel — 
why he’s willing to risk his life and 
his career to get his revenge. And 
I think that it’s worth it. And I 
want to help him.” 

She stood there, her shirt half on, 
eying him suspiciously. “You mean 
that? You really mean that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then you’re a bloody liar, 
Grimes.” 

“No,” he said slowly. “No. Not 
altogether. I want to help the Old 
Man, and I want to help you. This 
piracy has convinced me that you 
Rim Worlders are getting the dirty 
end of the stick. I may not be the 
finest gunnery officer in the whole 
bloody galaxy, but I’m better ac- 
quainted with the new stuff than 
Captain Craven is . .” 

Her grin was openly derisive. 
“First it’s fellow feeling for another 
spaceman, then it’s international 
politics. What next?” 

“Where we started. I do love you, 
Jane. And if there’s going to be any 
shooting, I want to be on hand to 
do the shooting back on your behalf. 
I’ll admit that . that what’s hap- 
pened has influenced my decision. 
But you didn’t buy me, or bribe me.

IF 




Don’t think that. Don’t ever think 
that.” There was a note of pleading 
in his voice. “Be realistic, Jane. With 
another officer along, especially an 
officer with recent gunnery train- 
ing, you stand a damn’ sight better 
chance than you would otherwise.” 
“I ... I suppose so. But I still 
don’t like it.” 

“You don’t have to. But why look 
a gift horse in the mouth?” 

“All right. You win. Get your 
clothes on and come and see the 
old man.”

J ane Pentecost led Grimes to the 
airlock. The ship seemed oddly 
deserted, and he remarked on this. 
The girl explained that the passen- 
gers had b^n requested to remain 
in their accommodation, and that 
most of Delta Orionis* personnel 
were employed in work aboard Epsi- 
lon Sextans, 

“So I haven’t been the only one 
to be kept under lock and key,” 
commented Grimes sardonically. 

“You’re the only one,” retorted 
the girl, “who’s been compensated 
for his imprisonment.” 

There was no answer to that, so 
the ensign remained silent. Saying 
nothing, he inspected with interest 
the temporary tunnel that had been 
rigged between the airlocks of the 
two ships. So Epsilon Sextans* pres- 
sure hull had been made good, her 
atmosphere had been restored. That 
meant that the work of installing the 
armament had been completed. He 
hoped that he would not have to 
insist upon modifications. 



The wreck — although she was a 
wreck no longer — bore her scars. 
The worst damage had been repair- 
ed, but holes and slashes that did 
not impair her structural strength 
were untouched, and spatters of once 
molten metal still made crazy pat- 
terns on beams and frames, stanch- 
ions and bulkheads. And there were 
the scars made by Craven’s engineers 
— the raw, bright cicatrices of new 
welding. 

Forward they made their way, 
deck after deck. The elevator in the 
axial shaft was not yet working, so 
Grimes had time and opportunity to 
appreciate the extent of the damage. 
They passed through the wreckage 
of the “farm” — the burst algae 
tanks, the ruptured vats in which 
yeast and tissue cultures were black 
and dead, frostbitten and dehydrated. 
They brushed through alleyways 
choked with the brittle fronds of 
creeping plants killed by the ulti- 
mate winter. 

And then they were passing 
through the accommodation levels. 
Bulkheads had been slashed through, 
destroying the privacy of the cabins 
that ^ey had once enclosed, des- 
troying the privacy and the occu- 
pants. There were no longer any 
bodies; for this Grimes was deeply 
thankful. (He learned later that 
Craven’s first action had been to or- 
der and conduct a funeral service.) 
There were no bodies, but there were 
still stains. Men and woman die 
quickly in hard vacuum — quickly 
and messily. 

C aptain Craven was alone in the 
control room. He was working.

ra/ther slowly and clumsily, wiring 
up an obviously makeshif t panel that 
was additional to the original one 
installed before the master’s ac- 
celeration chair. It was obvious 
that it was the remote controls for 
the newly fitted weaponry. Grimes 
said quietly, “There’s no need for 
that, sir.” 

Craven started, let go of his screw- 
driver, made a fumbling grab for it 
as it drifted away from him. He 
stared at Grimes, then growled, “So 
it’s you, is it?” Then, to Jane, “What 
the hell do you mean by letting 
this puppy out of his kennel?” 
“Captain Craven,” she told him 
quietly, “Mr. Grimes wants to come 
with us.” 

''What? I warn you, Miss Pente- 
cost, I’m in no mood for silly jokes.” 
“This is not a silly joke. Cap- 
tain,” said Grimes. “I’ve had time 
to think things over. I feel, I really 
feel that you have a far better 
chance if there’s a qualified officer 
along to handle the gunnery.” 
Craven looked at them, from the 
girl to Grimes, then back again. He 
said, “Ensign, didn’t I warn you?” 
“It’s not that way at all, sir,” 
Grimes told him, flushing. “In fact. 
Miss Pentecost has been trying hard 
to dissuade me.” 

"Ohr* 

“It’s true,” said Jane. “But he 
told me that we couldn’t afford to 
look a gift horse in the mouth.” 
“I don’t know what’s been hap- 
pening,” rasped Craven. “I don’t 
want to know what’s been happen- 
ing between the two of you. This 
change of mind, this change of heart 
is rather . sudden. No matter. 



One volunteer, they say, is worth 
ten pressed men.” He glared coldly 
at the ensign. “And you volunteer?” 
“Yes, Captain.” 

“I believe you. I have no choice 
in the matter. But you realize the 
consequences?” 

“I do.” 

“Well, I may be able to do some- 
thing to clear your yardarm. I’ve still 
to make my last entries in the Of- 
ficial Log of Delta Orionis, before 
I hand it over to Captain Kennedy. 
And when it comes to such docu- 
mentation, nobody cares to accuse a 
shipmaster of being a liar. Not out 
loud.” He paused, thinkin g. “How 
does this sound. Miss Pentecost? 
Date, Time, Position, etc., etc, Mr. 
John Grimes, passenger, holding the 
rank of ensign in the Federation 
Survey Service, removed by force 
from the vessel to Epsilon Sextans, 
there to supervise the installation 
and mounting of the armament. Sur- 
vey Service property, discharged on 
my orders from No. 1 hold, also to 
advise upon the use of same in the 
subsequent event of an action’s be- 
ing fought. Signed, and witnessed.” 
“Rather long winded, sir. But it 
seems to cover the ground.” 

“I intend to do more than advise!” 
flared Grimes. 

“Pipe down. Or, if you must say 
it, m^e sure that there aren’t any 
witnesses around when you say it. 
Now, when it comes to the original 
supervision, you see what I’m try- 
ing to do. Will it work?” 

“After a fashion, sir. But it will 
work much better if the fire control 
panel is entirely separate from man- 
euvering control.” 



IF 




“You don’t think that I could 
handle both at once?” 

“You could. But not with opti- 
mum efficiency. No humanoid 
could. This set-up of yours might 
just work if we were Shaara, or any 
of the other multilimbed arthropods. 
But even the Shaara, in their war- 
ships, don’t expect the Queen-Cap- 
tain to handle her ship and her guns 
simultaneously.” 

“You’re the expert. I just want 
to be sure that you’re prepared to 
quote, advise, unquote with your 
little pink paws on the actual key- 
board of your battle organ.” 
“That’s just the way that I pro- 
pose to advise.” 



“Good. Fix it up to suit yourself, 
then. I should be able to let you 
have a mechanic shortly to give you 
a hand.” 

“Before we go any further, sir, 
I’d like to make an inspection of 
the weapons themselves. Just in 
case . .” 

“Just in case I’ve made some fan- 
tastic bollix, eh?” Craven was almost 
cheerful. 

“Very good. But try to make 
it snappy. It’s time we were on 
our way.” 

“Yes,” said Jane, and it seemed 
that the Captain’s discarded som- 
berness was hanging about her life 
a cloud. “It’s time.”

IF , * Short Story 



THE FANTASQUE 

by JAMES McKIMMEY 



Why bother to live — when there is 
so much more to get from illusion? 



H omer Bemoth had read about 
the Fantasque; an eight-million- 
dollar magazine campaign can hard- 
ly be ignored by anyone save pos- 
sibly the illiterate, prisoners, monks, 
the insane and those hermited into 
outer space. The campaign had been 
given an additional thrust by the 
formation of the conservative-based 
OTDF (Outlaw The Dirty Fantas- 
que), whose devout members had 
long ago given up their ancient 
fights against fluoridation, porno- 
graphic literature, Liberal Episco- 
palianism and LSD ... as well as 
the One Planetary System, which 
had never captured much fervor be- 
cause it was still on the drawing 
board. 

Homer recalled a fire-eyed OTDF 
member placing in his hand a 
pamphlet which had read: 

“Ihe Fantasque is the most ne- 
farious scheme ever to be devised by 
the Ugly Mind in order to jelly the 
spine of resistance and contaminate. 



infiltrate and corrupt the brains of 
those who stand for one hundred 
per cent Hemispherism. It must be 
outlawed at once, to protect our 
Hemispherian way of life! Do not 
listen to the hogwash propaganda 
of the Ugly Mind behind this dead- 
ly conspiracy. Sign the petition now 
and put your Hemispherism where 
your mouth is!” 

Homer had asked, “Who is the 
Ugly Mind?” 

The incredulous member had 
shouted, “Them!” 

The OTDF effort was immediate- 
ly neutralized by the liberal^based 
group formed in retaliation and call- 
ing itself HFFOTF (Hemispherians 
For Freedom Of The Fantasque), 
owning a charter committee created 
of two prominent scientists, one In- 
dependent of the Hemispheric Sen- 
ate, three well known sculptors, an 
actor and an actress known inter- 
nationally and ten famous writers in- 
cluding the recently celebrated

Camubald Jones, author of Would 
You Invite a Martian to Dinner, 
Mother? — a work that had imme- 
diately climbed to the top of the 
best-seller charts, despite the fact 
that the first exploratory shot to 
Mars had failed to indicate any in- 
telligent life on that planet. 

The HFFOTF fight to shelve pro- 
posed outlawing legislation was en- 
tirely successful, and sales of the 
Fantasque expanded despite the 
near-prohibitive cost of the machine. 
A caustic columnist had gone to the 
trouble of checking sales records of 
Fantasque Incorporated to discover 
that no members of either the OTDF 
or the HFFOTF had purchased a 
model, or even tried one out, and 
reported the fact in a syndicated 
column. The response from both 
sides was that it was not the point. 

H omer Bemoth, in his San Fran- 
cisco Brindlehoffen house con- 
structed by seating a preconstructed 
aluminum rectangle on a power- 
rotated foundation, had never allow- 
ed himself the indulgence of even 
considering a Fantasque. Homer had 
never been a tearing success at much 
of anything, during his forty-three 
years; he couldn’t afford an Alexis 
Mobile Street- Jumper, let alone the 
luxury of a $20,000 Fantasque. Too, 
his wife Grace had become a mem- 
ber of the OTDF. 

“Why, for God’s sake?” Homer 
asked. “You don’t know anything 
about it!” 

“That doesn’t matter!” Grace re- 
plied, tapping a sheaf of OTDF 
literature. “It’s a dirty invention of 
the Ugly Mind.” 



“Well, who in the hell is that?” 

“ThemI” 

Grace had felt the dull sorrow 
of a marriage gone wrong for a 
number of years. She’d had long 
hopes for Homer, in the beginning; 
but he had simply washed out in his 
efforts. He’d tried perhaps fifty ways 
of making a living and had never 
possessed the sense or conviction of 
intent to stay with any one of 
them. Instead, he skipped from one 
job to another in a frenzied desire to 
accomplish everything and had, as 
it turned out, accomplished nothing. 

Currently Homer was employed 
as an aide in the engineering de- 
partment of a firm manufacturing 
Swirley’s Shape Slax. The job was 
an embarrassment to Grace, who 
could not bear to tell her friends 
that her husband spent five days a 
week running about a room doing 
inconsequential things for a group 
of engineers whose total purpose was 
to improve lines in women’s slacks 
containing fake posteriors. Before 
moving to San Francisco Grace had 
been brought up in the severe and 
austere fashion of North Pole fron- 
tier life, where the rigorous moral 
code was law. Godliness, cleanliness, 
decency and thrift guided Grace’s 
ship of life. It was fortunate that she 
knew something about the last, be- 
cause Homer brought home just 
enough money to make it from Fri- 
day to Friday. 

Grace had seriously considered 
divorcing Homer — an action not in 
conflict with her upbringing. But 
the short-lived Church State had left 
a piece of compromise legislation not 
yet repealed. A partner seeking di- 



THE FANTASQUE

vorce automatically waived all ma- 
terial possessions of the marriage. 
The law had curtailed a ballooning 
divorce situation; but it had not, 
Grace considered bitterly, lightened 
the burden of finding yourself in a 
barrel with a sour pickle. 

It was not that they owned much. 
But she did love their Brindlehoffen 
house, blue china, Oriental rug and 
the three-wheeled jet-cart which she 
drove to the market daily. Those 
things were enough to keep her in 
Homer Bemoth’s bed; but she was 
rankling under dissatisfaction, hoping 
desperately that the legislation might 
be repealed. 

Then a letter arrived. 

G race, who never opened Homer’s 
personal mail, looked at the 
lawyer’s return printed on the flap 
of the envelope and waited impati- 
ently for Homer’s return that eve- 
ning. When he had settled into his 
floater chair with a bourbon and 
water, he finally opened it. 

“What does it say?” Grace de- 
manded. 

“Uncle Forbes blinked out.” 
“Died?” 

“You bet your astro. He laid 
seventy-five thousand on me!” 
“Great heavens!” Grace said in 
shock. 

Homer blinked, then his round and 
ruddy face crinkled with a satyrlike 
grin. “I’ll tell you what I’m going 
to do first.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Tell those asses what they can 
do with that phoney-fanny job!” 

As Homer got into his pajamas, 
Grace lay trying to become con- 



vinced of the reality of it. “We’re 
going to have to study investments. 
Good, solid, sensible investments!” 
Then she noticed that Homer had 
turned the rotator of the foundation 
•so that the window he was peering 
through faced next door where 
a young wife often failed to draw 
her bedroom drapes. “Homer!” 
“That girl’s absolutely leafless.” 
“iifomer!” And, when he’d finally 
gotten into bed, she said, “Did you 
hear me about the investments?” 
“Sure.” 

“Do you really think you should 
quit your job? I mean, after all — ” 
‘Tomorrow morning I tell them to 
stick it.” 

She tried to console herself with 
the thought that once the novelty of 
the inheritance wore away she could 
perhaps convince him to find new 
employment. $75,000 was an awfully 
lot of money, but it was not enough 
on which simply to give up — she 
was certain of that. 

“Let’s celebrate,” Homer said 
hopefully. 

“Not tonight.” 

“Why not?” 

“Maybe tomorrow night,” 

When the legal work was com- 
pleted and the money collected, 
Homer concentrated on his retire- 
ment. He bowled, fished, sang, went 
to the amusement park, watched 
movies and television, stood on a 
downtown corner smiling at girls, 
night^lubbed, hummed and even 
tried advanced air skiing by renting 
the use of a small piloted pull-plane 
and propulsion skis. Near the end 
of the first month Grace found 
him on the back stoop, whittling. 



48 



IF 




“Why are you doing that now?” 
“I’m going to become the best 
Whittier in town!” 

The next day, when Homer had 
forgotten about that, Grace said des- 
perately, “We can’t just let the 
money sit in the bank on that lousy 
interest. If you’re not going to get 
another job — ” 

But Homer was shuffling through 
the mail. “By God, look at this.” 
Grace took a letter and started 
to read: 

Dear Mr. Bemoth: 

We are extraordinarily pleased 
to inform you that you have 
been personally selected to try 
our latest model of the Fantas- 
que. As you undoubtedly know,

Grace looked up, eyes clouded 
with indignation. 

“How about that?” Homer said. 
“The dirty thing!” 

“You don’t know anything about 
it!” 

“I belong to the OTDF!” 
“Fantasque doesn’t a^k just any- 
body!” 

“ITiey heard about your inheri- 
tance!” 

“They heard about my reputa- 
tionr 



T iat afternoon Homer walked in- 
to the sleek Fantasque studios 
where a youngish man with shimng 
black hair and a flashing snaile 
stepped forward to shake his hand. 
“Homer Bemoth here.” 

“Not really!” said the salesman, 
putting a genuine note of disbelief 
into his voice. 

Moments later he was escorted 
into a room where he looked at a 
silver metal cubicle with a small 
door. 

“I thought it would be bigger.” 
“It’s quite compact,” said the sales- 
man. 

“Where do you put the dam 
thing?” 

“Into the garage, if you’ve got an 
outlet there. Just plug in. Simple 
as that. Give it a whirl?” 

“As long as I’m here.” 

The salesman opened the door 
to the interior which contained a 
control panel and a leather-cushion- 
ed chair upon which rested a white 
helmet sprouting wires. “The hel- 
met contains the psychotrode con- 
nections. That is the heart of the 
accomplishment — they tune right 
into your imagination, you see? Gou- 
ple you up with the computer. That’s 
what makes it absolutely real.” 

“No screens?” 

“No, sir. It goes on inside your 
brain, because of those sweet little 
psychotrodes. You are there r 
“Won’t it drive you nuts?” 
“Fantasque has been tested by 
over a thousand persons, in its home 
laboratory. It is absolutely one hun- 
dred per cent safe for any man’s 
brain — especially, I might add, one 
owned by a person of your caliber.” 



THE FANTASQUE

“I’ll be damned.” 

“Behind the control panel is the 
computer. Into it has been fed every 
sort of piece of information con- 
cerning any given target selected. 
All you do is start with Indicator 1 
and turn it to the first letter of the 
name of your target. You work over 
until you’ve spelled it out. Say you 
wish to travel to New York City. 
Bang. You’re looking at the city. If 
you wish to become more specific, 
keep on spelling — Manhattan, or, 
if you will, Empire State Building. 
You’ll be there.” 

“Hard to believe.” 

“Those are just general instruc- 
tions, for the beginner. But if you 
wish to go into a specific store, say, 
then you get into more experience 
handling. You take hold of Knob X 
and Knob A and fly, as it were, with 
the Fantasque. It takes some con- 
centrating, letting the imagination go 
to work. But those controls, coupled 
wilii the psychotrodes, will send you 
rigjht where you want to go. Climb 
in. Put on the helmet. Take a shot 
at it.” 

The salesman watched Homer 
make his way inside to sit down on 
the chair and place the helmet on 
his head. 

“What’ll it be, Mr. Bemoth?” 
“The new, expanded Disneyland! 
I’ve never been there.” 

“Spell it out!” 

H omer set the indicators. Then 
he sat immobile. Suddenly his 
bands jumped forward to grasp and 
X and A knobs. He let out a yelp 
and looked around, wide-eyed. “By 
God!” 



“There, you see, Mr. Bemoth?” 

“You bet! A kid was licking a 
cone right by my ear! So I saw this 
place I wanted to go into. I grabbed 
the knobs. But I landed in a river 
staring a damned crocodile down the 
throat!” 

“You have to take it easy at first, 
Mr. Bemoth. Don’t try to do every- 
thing at once. It’s like an electric 
organ you’ve never played before. 
You want to try the simple melo- 
dies with one hand, then the pedal 
notes, then the second hand, then 
the drawbars, the vibrator tabs, the 
whole business. But it takes time and 
practice. Where next?” 

“Bismark, North Dakota. My old 
home town!” 

“See that lighted red button? Press 
it. That cancels out your previous 
target.” 

Homer pressed; the light went out. 

“Spell, Mr. Bemoth.” 

Homer rapidly punched letters. 
Then he sat rigidly. Suddenly his 
hands jumped again. A forefinger 
jabbed at the indicators. He yelled 
out happily. 

The salesman was wagging his 
head disapprovingly as Homer turn- 
ed around, perspiring and joyful. 

“Now you see, Mr. Bemoth — ” 

“I was in Bismark! Then I punch- 
ed out Little Rock. There was Bis- 
mark in back. Little Rock in 
front — !” 

“But it’s much better to stay in 
one place at one time. We’ve done 
extensive experimenting on that. Re- 
member you’re using psychotrodes. 
You’re dealing with dimensional pro- 
cesses as well. While we guarantee 
the absolute safety of the machine 



50 



IF 




when properly used, we don’t advise 
anyone to tax his brain too greatly. 
Let’s stay on one target at a time, 
shall we, Mr. Bemoth?” 

“Right!” 

“Where next?” 

“Saskatoon!” 

After a dozen flights, Homer 
pitched out of the machine excited- 
ly. “By God!” he whooped. “That 
son of a gun!” 

The salesman led Homer to a 
table where he handed him a leather- 
bound book. “The official manual. 
Instructions for every conceivable 
performance the machine is capable 
of handling. I’ll guarantee they’re 
limitless.” 

Homer opened the book. 
“Illustrated there, for example, are 
your color plungers. As you tested 
it, the machine was simply set on 
Color-General. With these, you can 
shoot for perfection. Here are your 
dimension sticks. Your level indica- 
tors. Your temperature guides. Your 
time bars.” 

“T/m^ bars?” 

“As I said, Mr. Bemoth, no limit. 
Once you learn to handle these, you 
can shoot back and look in, for in- 
stance, on the Boston Tea Party. The 
entire affair has been fed into the 
computer. You’ll be there Decem- 
ber 16, 1773, when the colonists 
dumped tea into the harbor.” 

The saleman talked on, edging 
an order contract toward Homer, 
who said, “Probably isn’t a real 
point, understand. But I was just 
curious.” 

“Certainly.” 

“How much has been shot into 
that computer?” 



“The world, Mr. Bemoth.” 

“Mind you, I wouldn’t think of 
wanting to do it myself. But say 
some dirty-minded old man came 
in and bought one of those machines 
and tuned himself in on undressing 
time for, oh, Marie Antoinette, right 
there in the boudoir.” 

The salesman’s face blanched. 
“Mr. Bemoth!” 

“I didn’t say Vd want to do it. But 
I was just thinking — ” 

“It’s that damnable organization, 
OTDF! Be honest, Mr. Bemoth. 
You’ve read their propaganda, 
haven’t you?” 

“They slipped me a pamphlet or 
two, yes. But — ” 

“FUthy lies! That computer is as 
clean as the purest snow! Not one 
single item remotely associated with 
the prurient has ever been fed into 
one of our computers! The Fantas- 
que represents the cleanest enter- 
tainment since checkers! Yet,” the 
salesman went on in a breaking 
voice, “those damnable OTDF peo- 
ple — ” 

“I’m sorry I brought it up,” 
Homer said. 

“I’ll get hold of myself in a mo- 
ment.” 

The salesman got out a hand- 
kerchief and blew his nose. “Do you 
wish to sign the order, Mr. Bemoth? 
We have excellent financing terms, 
of course.” 

“Cash, if you don’t mind.” 

W hen Homer told his wife she 
swept into violent hysterics. 
“Twenty thousand dollars!” 

“Plus tax.” 

“For that dirty thing!” 



THE FANTASQUE

“Lies. That machine’s as clean 
as (the piirest snow!” 

“The neighbors’ll see it delivered!’* 
“They deliver in a plain brown 
box!” 

When it had been, Grace would 
not go into the garage and look at 
it. Instead she howled, screamed 
and poured forth an incredible 
amount of tears. Homer closed him- 
self away inside the machine. 

After that, he spent most of his 
waking time there, traveling from 
Tripoli to Odessa to Trinidad to 
Kalgoorlie to Dublin; he joined 
Hannibal crossing the Alps, Stephen 
urging the Children’s Crusade, Char- 
lennagne invading Italy, Columbus 
sighting San Salvador Island, Mich- 
elangelo carving Pieta. He explain- 
ed the machine’s operation precise- 
ly to Grace. But she insisted that it 
was an evil instrument, creating an 
unreal world only to titillate the 
senses; she wouldn’t go near it. 
Homer gave up on her and continued 
his travels, tearing wildly across con- 
tinents, plunging back and forth in 
time. He appeared outside only to 
sleep, eat and read the newspapers 
in order to find ideas for fresh 
journeys. 

It was during a newspaper inter- 
val that Grace stared at him with 
reddened eyes and said, “You love 
that dirty thing more than me!” 
Homer listened vaguely, deciding 
that he would finally blast off on his 
first space shot — he’d willed him- 
self to save that one. 

Grace’s face flushed. “What’s 
happened to our sex life?” 

Homer looked up in astonishment. 
“5ejc life!” 



When he returned to his news- 
paper, he noticed a small classified 
ad, feeling his heart quicken its 
beat. 

A week later, Grace’s sense of 
cleanliness forced her to the garage 
to sweep. She kept her eyes away 
from the silver metal cubicle as she 
did. He was in there, as he always 
was; and, she thought, he could stay 
in there the rest of his existence. 
She shifted some empty cartons. 
Then she saw another which she 
could not remember. It was empty 
except for a printed sheet of paper. 
She drew that out and read: 

“Welcome to your Jing-Jang 
Adapter! Follow the simple instruc- 
tions to install this delicious addition 
to your machine. Then SEE, The 
Way You Like It: Cleopatra Up 
The Nile, Pocahontas Under The 
Waterfall, Lady Godiva On 
Her . ” Grace read the other 
seven titles and threw the paper 
down in fury. 

Quivering, she strode to the 
Fantasque and yanked the door 
open. She gasped, staring inside. 

Homer’s clothing and shoes lay 
in a loose pile around the chair 
upon which rested the white helmet. 

“Homer!” she said sharply, then 
realized the foolishness of that; he 
simply was not there. 

She remembered that only an 
hour ago he’d walked aloofly past 
her in the kitchen, and come down. 

She checked the large garage 
doors; they were locked from the 
inside. So were the windows, as well 
as another small door. There was 
no way that he could have gotten 
out. 



52 



IF 




Pulse beating, she considered it. 
She recalled all that Homer had told 
her about the machine. Grace was 
not an adventurer in abstract think- 
ing, but she wasn’t stupid either. 

She hurried to the telephone, and, 
in a few minutes, was connected to 
the Fantasque studios. She said to 
the salesman, “I was wondering 
something about your machine.” 

“Of course.” 

“Suppose somebody got going 
with it.” 

“In what way?” 

“Say he got excited and tried to 
be in several places at the same time. 
Maybe ten different places, at the 
same time.” 

“That would not be recommend- 
ed, madam!” 

“Could he just disappear? Split 
up in all directions? Fade out in 
other dimensions? So there isn’t any- 
thing left but his clothes?” 

T here was a startled pause, then 
the man said, “This isn’t some- 
one from that damnable OTDF, is 
it?” 

“I was just wondering if you’d 
ever had anything happen like 
that?” 

“Madam, that is utterly absurd! 
Our machine has been thoroughly 
tested.” 



“But you couldn’t test mice, or 
even monkeys, with that dimensional 
business and the psycho-thingajigs, 
could you? I mean, animals don’t 
have brains like humans. And every 
human brain is different.” 

“There is the psychological to con- 
sider, of course. And dimension is 
certainly involved. Yet the postula- 
tion is ridiculous. But — if anything 
might have gone wrong, pledse tell 
us who you are. We’ll immediately 
send our best men over to — ” 
“What would you do if had hap- 
pened? Pull the plug?” 

“My God, no! That would break 
all connections! Leave the poor 
devil in limbo — maybe a ten-way 
limbo! I mean . Madam, if you’ll 
just — !” 

She hung up and began humming 
as she returned to the garage. She 
was thinking that she would wait a 
few days, then report him missing. 
The divorce legislation also covered 
desertion; in six months all of their 
possessions would be wholly hers. 
Then she could sell that machine 
and really get started with her in- 
vestments. 

She opened the door of the Fan- 
tasque and removed his shoes and 
clothing from it. Then she pulled the 
plug.

HETIEF , 

WAR CRIMINAL 

by KEITH LAUMER 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Retief didn't mind the eons- 
dead heroes of this world — 
but they wouldn't stay dead! 



1 

A n evening breeze bearing the 
fragrance of ten-thousand year 
old Heo trees in bloom moved across 
the Embassy dining terrace. In the 
distance pipes sounded softly, pick- 
ing out a haunting melody, like fairy 
feet retracing a forgotten path 
through an enchanted forest. The 
setting sun, vast and smoky red, cast 
crimson shadows along the leaf- 
shaded streets below. 

“A pity all this is dying.” First 



Secretary Magnan of the Terran 
Mission to Sulinore waved a hand 
toward the fragile, crumbling towers 
silhouetted against the dusk. “In 
spite of a million years of civiliza- 
tion and a reputation for immor- 
tality, the Sulinorians seem impotent 
to stem the population decline. I sup- 
pose in a century or less they’ll all 
be gone.” 

“With ninety-nine per cent of the 
planetary surface devoted to ceme- 
teries, historical shrines and monu- 
ments to the past, there’s not much 



54 




room for the living,” Second Secre- 
tary Relief commented. “And you 
can tie up a lot of minerals in a 
planet-wide graveyard.” 

“I suppose you’re referring to 
their belief that the world’s supply 
of Divine Effluvium is exhausted,” 
Magnan sniffed. “Mere folklore, of 
course. Still, one might almost be 
tempted to look into the matter 
of depletion of essential elements — 
except that Corps policy forbids pok- 
ing into local religious doctrine. And 
in any event, they won’t permit any 
deep-mining operations which might 
disturb the hallowed dead — or the 
sleeping heroes, as they prefer to 
put it.” 

Magnan cocked an eye at the 
small humanoid waiter standing at 
a discreet distance, apparently lost 
in thought. “One can’t help thinking 
that the modern Sulinorian is a far 
cry from his legendary ancestors,” 
he said beliind his hand. “Just com- 
pare these civilized little chaps with 
those ghastly statues you see every- 
where.” 

T he local turned, approached the 
table, a polite expression on his 
elfin features. 

“You wished something, sir?” 
“Why, ah, tell me.” Magnan clear- 
ed his throat. “How does the Sulino- 
rian in the street feel about all this? 
Wouldn’t you be willing to see a 
modest rock-mining operation set up 
here to unlock some of those scarce 
elements that are tied up in the 
planetary crust?” 

“Modest, my lord? The figure I 
heard was a million metric tons per 
day per unit, and Great Tussore 



knows how many units.” He looked 
toward the ruin-crowned skyline. 
**Rather the easy erosion of eons/ 
than eaten by industry's engines in- 
satiable/* he quoted. “At least that’s 
what the poet Eulindore said a cou- 
ple of millenia ago. Me, I wouldn’t 
know.” 

“But what about importation?'* 
Magnan persisted. “Why, your Ad- 
ministrative Council turned thumt: 
down flatly on the CDT proposa’ 
that we haul in a few million cubic 
miles of useful minerals and establish 
raw material dumps that all could 
draw on freely!” 

“I guess we’d rather look at the 
landscape the way it is, sir,” the 
Sulinorian said. “And besides, root- 
ing in a dump isn’t our style. You 
know, a race of heroes and all that.” 
He flicked an imaginary crumb from 
the table. “How about another fla- 
gon of ancient wine, my lords? Laid 
down by Yodross in the year 574,- 
635. That would be abooit 3600 
B.C., old Terry reckoning.” 

“I think not — ” Magnan broke 
off as the table-side P.A. unit ping- 
ed and lit up. The plump features of 
Ambassador Shindlesweet snapped 
into mirror-bright focus on the one- 
way screen. 

“Ah, gentlemen,” the portly diplo- 
mat beamed. “It’s my pleasure to in- 
form the staff that the Blug delega- 
tion has, after all, been prevailed 
upon to be present at the Peace Con- 
ference here on Sulinore.” 

“What, those bloodthirsty little 
killers?” Magnan gasped. “With their 
armor and their opaque atmosphere 
helmets and their sneaky ways? Why, 
everybody knows they’re the Groaci’s 



RETIEF^.WAR CRIMINAL 



55 




proteges, and responsible for all the 
fighting!” 

“At least that’s a dozen or so 
Blugs that won’t be off plundering 
somewhere — as long as the confer- 
ence is on anyway,” Retief pointed 
out. 

. a gesture which reflects their 
sincere desire to see peace restored 
to the Sector,” Shindlesweet was 
rumbling on. “And with all due 
modesty, I think I may say — ” 

A pale visage sporting five stalked 
eyes crowded onto the screen, 
thrusting the Terrestrial ambassador 
aside. 

“As you’re perhaps aware,” the 
Groaci ambassador whispered in his 
faint voice, “it was through my ef- 
forts as co-sponsor of the present 
talks that this happy eventuality was 
brought about. And — ” 

“Look here, Mr. Ambassador,” 
Shindlesweet muttered from the side 
of his mouth, turning a glassy smile 
to the camera. “I was on the air 
first!” 

“Hogging the limelight, as usual, 
George,” the Groaci hissed. “An un- 
fortunate habit of yours. But as I 
was saying,” he addressed the 
screen, “I was able, through deft 
handling of a number of sensitive 
issues — ” 

“Now just a minute, Shith!” The 
Terran forced his way back to center 
screen. “When I agreed to lend the 
weight of Terran participation to 
your confounded gabfest, I — ” 

“Ha! You begged me on bended 
anterior ginglymus joint to be per- 
mitted to crowd in!” 

“Why, you little — ” 



“Ah-ah,” Ambassador Shith ad- 
monished. “No racial epithets, 
George. Open mike, remember?” 

Retief and Magnan had a last 
quick glimpse of Shindlesweet’s 
rage-flushed features as he reached 
to blank the screen. 

“Well, the peace talks are off to 
a rousing start,” Retief said cheer- 
fully. Magnan shook his head, look- 
ing grave. 

“I foresee no good to come of 
this gathering.” He rose and looked 
at his watch. “We’ve time for a 
constitutional before dinner, Retief. 
And if we’re to dine cheek by mandi- 
ble with our Groaci colleagues at to- 
night’s banquet, I for one have need 
of a hearty appetite.” 

II 

A block from the renovated palace 
housing the Terran Chancery, 
Magnan plucked at Relief’s arm. 

“Look there; another party of 
Groaci Peacekeepers, in full armor. 
You’d think they were expecting full 
scale rioting to break out at any 
moment.” 

A block away, a squad of con- 
stabulary, in grotesque flaring hel- 
mets and black hip-cloaks, side-arms 
at knobby hif>s, minced briskly along 
the empty avenue. 

“Shith was quite insistent that the 
Groaci be assigned responsibility 
for the security arrangements for 
the Conference,” Magnan muttered. 
“They have the only guns on the 
planet.” 

“For alleged police, those fellows 
have a suspicious look of regular in- 
fantry about them,” Retief said. 



56 



IP 




“Good lord, you don’t imagine 
they’re planning anything foolish?” 
Magnan gasped. “Everybody knows 
the Groaci secretly covet Sulinore. 
They’ve even tried to have it official- 
ly declared a deserted world, open 
to colonization.” 

“It’s a little hard to see how they 
could swing it, with a full squadron 
of CDT Peace Enforcers standing by 
off-planet,” Retief said. 

“You’re right. We’re imagining 
things.” Magnan shook his head 
briskly. “A few dozen blasters can’t 
take over a world. Still, I’d as soon 
avoid these bravos. In their arrogance 
they might attempt some sort of 
harassment.” He angled across to- 
ward the entrance to a side street. 

“That’s the route to the Forbid- 
den City, off-limits to foreigners,” 
Retief said. “How badly do you 
want to miss the fuzz?” 

“Nht that badly.” Magnan shud- 
dered, veered in the opposite direc- 
tion. “If even half the stories are 
true, not even our gnawed bones 
would ever be found.” 

F ifteen minutes later they were in 
a narrow, crooked street where 
age-weathered carved griffins, satyrs 
and nymphs adorned the steep fac- 
ades of the deserted buildings lining 
the way. 

“This isn’t the most cheerful route 
for a stroll,” Magnan commented un- 
easily. “At least not after sundown.” 
He cocked his head. “One almost 
imagines one can hear stealthy foot- 
steps behind one.” 

“Not so stealthy at that,” Retief 
said. “They’ve been getting pretty 
careless the last five minutes, as if 



they didn’t care whether we heard 
them or not.” 

“You mean someone’s really fol- 
lowing us?” Magnan turned to stare 
back along the shadowy late-evening 
street. 

“Two someones,” Retief corrected. 
“Non-humans, I’d say, weighing in 
at under a hundred pounds, and 
wearing padded shoes.” 

“That could mean anything! There 
are forty-six non-^human spedes on- 
world this week for the conference, 
and I can think of at least ten of 
them that wouldn’t be above assault- 
ing a pair of peaceful Terran diplo- 
mats for their own nefarious ends.” 

“Or for the iridium in their 
teeth,” Retief amplified. 

“I think I recognize the street 
ahead,” Magnan muttered. “Coriale’s 
Comestible Counter is just around 
the corner. I was there last week — 
in daylight — making some arrange- 
ments for the Reception. We can 
nip inside and ’phone the Embassy 
for transportation back . .” He 
broke off as they came in view of a 
high, narrow shop-front displaying 
the cranium and crossed thighbones, 
the Sulinorian symbols of a caterer’s 
establishment. Beneath the deeply in- 
cised device, the windows were dark, 
the massive stonewood door shut 
tight. 

“It’s closed!” Magnan put his nose 
against the glass “But there’s some- 
one inside. I head a sound.” 

Retief tried the heavily patinaed 
bronze door latch, cast in the form 
of fanged jaws clenched on a leg. 

“Perfiaps — great heavens, Re- 
tief! What are you doing?” Magnan 
blurted as Retief gripped the knob 



RETIEF, WAR CRIMINAL 



57 




in both hands and twisted hard. 
There was a sharp tinkle of break- 
ing metal. 

“Retief, stop!” Magnan gasped. 
“You can’t — ” 

“I think it might be a good idea 
to get in off the street — now!” 
Retief thrust his protesting senior 
through into the gloomy interior, 
whirled to ease the door silently 
shut. 

“We found the door unlocked,” 
he said briskly, looking around the 
room. “And stepped inside to see if 
everything was okay.” 

Magnan peered from the window, 
made a choking sound. “Two Sulino- 
rians in artisan’s headdress just came 
around the corner! They’ll find us 
here!” . 

“Let’s check the back room.” Re- 
tief led the way past tables heaped 
with displays of Sulinorian pastries, 
stuffed fowls and candied nutmeats, 
thrust aside a curtain. The dim 
shapes of stacked cartons bulked in 
the darkness. He sniffed the air, took 
a tiny handlight from his pocket, 
played the pencil-thin beam across 
the floor. 

“What’s that?” Magnan hissed, 
pointing. From behind a wall locker, 
a pair of narrow high-arched, long- 
toed feet protruded. Retief went 
across, flashed the light on a small, 
crumpled body. The bright robes 
were bedraggled and torn. A wound 
in the narrow chest oozed ochre 
blood. 

A Sulinorian,” Magnan breath- 
ed. “He’s been shot!” His lips 
moved in a faint whisper. Retief 
knelt beside him. 



“Who did it?” he asked urgently. 
“Why?” 

“He was not . what he seemed.” 
Retief caught the whispered words. 
Then the luminous eyes closed; the 
last tinge of vital color drained from 
the small face, leaving it an unattrac- 
tive shade of waxy green. 

“It looks like Coriale, the caterer,” 
Magnan groaned. “How terrible!” 

“Listen!” Retief raised a hand. 
From the far corner of the store- 
room a faint rustle sounded. He mo- 
tioned Magnan to the left, started 
around the right side of the stacked 
boxes. There was a hurried scuttling 
sound. 

“Why — there you are, Coriale,” 
Magnan’s voice squeaked. “We, er, 
just stepped in to increase our order. 
We’ll have twelve gross of the bean 
and kidney pies and six dozen jellied 
bramble-hens — under glass, of 
course . .” Magnan backed into 
view, keeping himself between the 
small local and the body in the com- 
er. The Sulinorian pulled free 
of Magnan’s grip on his elbow. His 
bright eyes flicked around the room. 

“But if you’re busy,” Magnan 
went on hastily, “we’ll just toddle 
along now . .” 

“Ummm. You are Terrestrials, 
isn’t it?” the alien piped in a piercing- 
ly high voice. 

“I’m, er, why, ah . .” Magnan 
swallowed audibly. “I was here just 
the other day, Mr. Coriale. Don’t 
you remember me?” 

“Yes. Quite so, I recalled now.” 
The Sulinorian moved toward the 
door. “Six dozen jellied kidney- 
beans and glass hens under mud, I’ll 
make notes of it. And now, you wish

to leave, are you? To be sure. Good- 
by quickly, please.” 

Magnan reached the door ahead 
of the local, fumbled it open. “Well, 
it was jolly seeing you, Coriale. By, 
now . He tugged at Reliefs 
sleeve. “Come along!” he hissed. 
“We’ie in a frightful rush, remem- 
ber?” 

“fm not sure Mr. Coriale got 
the order just right.” Retief eased 
Magnan aside, glanced out the door. 
The dark street was empty. Pale 
flames burning in blue glass globes 
high on the walls cast wavering 
shadows along the ancient cobbles. 

“It doesn’t matter! I’m sure he 
can cope.” Magnan’s voice faltered 
as his eye fell on the Sulinorian, 
from whose nostrils brown smoke 
was filtering. 

“Say, isn’t that brown smoke fil- 
tering from your nostrils?” he 
blinked. “I didn’t know you Sulino- 
rians smoked.” 

Coriale edged sideways, eyeing the 
door. “A new vice, acquiring this 
week only. And now, reluctance, 
farewell.” 

Magnan frowned. “Curious,” he 
said. “A few days ago you spoke 
perfect Galactic.” 

“Duck!” Retief snapped and 
dived past Magnan as the undersized 
alien made a lightning-fast motion. 

S omething flashed in his hand; a 
plate of hors d’oeuvres beside 
Magnan exploded in a shower of 
antipasto. With a yelp, Magnan 
leaped sideways, collided with the 
alien as the latter bounded aside 
from Retief’s charge. 

For a moment, there was a wild 



tangle of threshing limbs. Then Mag- 
nan staggered back, sat down hard. 
His head wobbled. He fell sideways 
and lay still. 

The Sulinorian had whirled, bring- 
ing the gun up — 

Retief swept a pie from a table, 
slammed it full into the pinched 
faced. The alien shrieked; the gun 
barked sharply, twice. One slug 
ripped the gilt epaulet from the 
shoulder of Retief’s wine-red mid- 
evening semi-official blazer. The 
second thunk !od into a pewter tur- 
een; thick purple soup spurted from 
paired holes. Then Retief was on 
the gunner. He twisted the alien’s 
gun^hand behind him, reached to 
seize his quarry’s other arm . and 
felt the room expand suddenly to 
three times its former size. 

He snorted hard, held his breath, 
threw the alien across the room. His 
legs felt like piano wire. He grabbed 
at a table for support, sent it crash- 
ing over on its side. 

Magnan sat up, spluttering, as a 
cascade of icy green punch sluiced 
over him. 

“Yes, yes. I’m coming. Mother,” 
he gasped. 

To Retief, Magnan’s voice seem- 
ed to be filtered through an echo 
chamber. As in a dream, he saw the 
other totter to his feet. 

“Wha . .” Magnan gobbled. 
“What happened?” His eyes focused 
on the room, took in the smashed 
crockery, the overturned furnishings, 
the spilled viands — and the 
crumpled figure against the wall. 

“Retief — he isn’t . .?” 

Retief shook his head to clear it. 
He went across to the fallen alien.

IP 




The creature lay on his back, eyes 
wide open, glassy. A great shard of 
broken punch-bowl protruded from 
his chest. His dead face was a livid 
purple. 

“Coriale!” Magnan choked. “Dead 
again!” 

“We’d better get out fast,” Re- 
tief said. “And sort out the Coriales 
in the morning.” 

“By all means!” Magnan whirled 
to the door, pulled it wide — and 
backed into the room, prodded by 
the gleaming barrel of a crater gun 
in the hands of a spindle-legged 
Groaci in the uniform of a Peace- 
keeper. 

“To make no move, vile miscre- 
ants,” the helmeted and greaved 
Shore Patroller hissed in his native 
tongue as his five stalked eyes 
scanned the shambles. “To have you 
red-handed this time. Soft Ones.” 

“You’re making a frightful mis- 
take,”^ Magnan choked as half a 
dozen more Groaci pushed into the 
shop, all with levelled weapons. “We 
didn’t — that is, I didn’t — I mean, 
Retief only — ” 

“Ah, Mr. Magnan, is it not?” the 
Patrol captain whispered in his faint 
voice. “The acceptance of your com- 
plete innocence, of course, dear sir. 
Provided only the testimony against 
the true criminal!” 

“True criminal?” Magnan stutter- 
ed. “You mean Retief? But — ” 

“What other?” the Groaci inquir- 
ed in a reasonable tone. 

“But . but . .” 

“To have no need to make a 
statement now,” the captain soothed. 
“To come along quietly and to leave 
us to deal with the killer.” He mo- 



tioned sharply and his subordinates 
closed in, hustled the protesting Mag- 
nan away. Then the Groaci turned 
to Retief. 

“To remember me, perhaps, Re- 
tief? Shluh by name, formerly of 
the Groacian Planetary Police, once 
deeply wronged by you. Tonight, in 
the cells of a Groaci prison, to even 
at last the bitter score.” 

Ill 

T he jeweled eye-shields of Cap- 
tain Shluh gave back brilliant 
glints from the dazzling white Inter- 
rogation lights rigged at the center 
of the dusty room. 

“Once more, my dear Retief,” he 
whispered in accent-free Terran. 
“What was your motive for your at- 
rocious crimes against the peace and 
order of Groac? Or Sulinore, if you 
prefer. Was it perhaps your plan to 
introduce subtle impurities into the 
provender to be supplied to the dele- 
gates? Or did your schemes run 
deeper? Was it you full intent to 
secrete illegal monitoring devices in 
the serving vessels — devices of the 
kind which I will testify were found 
on your person when you were 
searched?” 

“A couple of years pounding a 
beat have done wonders for you, 
Schluh,” Retief said conversational- 
ly. “You’ve lost that fat-behind-the- 
ears look. Unfortunately, you still 
sound about the same.” 

“And you, unlucky Terry, still 
indulge your penchant for flippancy! 
It will be amusing to watch the evolu- 
tion of your japes into pleas for mer- 
cy, as our acquaintance ripens.” 



RETIEF, WAR CRIMINAL

“You Groad must be planning 
something a Httle more elaborate 
than usual,” Retief mused aloud. 
“Conning Ambassador Shindlesweet 
into lending CDT backing to these 
phony peace talks took a lot of 
time and groundwork — and you 
lads don’t waste credits on empty 
gestures.” 

“You imply that our motives are 
less than selfless?” Shluh inquired 
in a careless tone. “Ah, well, what 
matter your thoughts, Soft One? You 
may share them freely with your exe- 
cutioner.” 

“Let’s look at it analytically,” Re- 
tief went on. “What have you ac- 
complished with all this effort, other 
than getting representatives of every 
important world in a CDT domi- 
nated sector of the Arm together in 
one room? But maybe that’s enough, 
eh, Shluh? If some unfortunate inci- 
dent occurred and wiped out the lot 
oi them, whoever was responsible 
would find himself in a most un- 
enviable position, public-relations- 
wise. And I have a feeling it wouldn’t 
be you Groaci who’d be left holding 
the satchel. Which leaves the CDT, 
the other sponsor of the gathering.” 

“Enough, presumptuous Terry!” 
S3iliih*s eyestalks were whipping in 
an agitated manner. “In your panic, 
you rant nonsense!” 

“And with the CDT discredited,” 
Retief continued, “Groac would 
have to step in to straighten out the 
confusion; and they just might find 
it necessary to call on someone like 
their friends the Blugs to help keep 
the peace during the emergency. 
And maybe, before things got back 
to normal, the few remaining Sulino- 



rians might just sort of go into a de- 
cline and die off, leaving an empty 
world for an enterprising power like 
Groac to latch onto.” 

4 T That fever fancies are these?” 
▼ V Shluh hissed. “It is known to 
all that you Terries, ever suspicious 
of the pure motives of others, have 
installed Mark XXI surveillance de- 
vices at the port and throughout the 
Conference rooms, thus making im- 
possible the introduction of any wea- 
pons other than the handful alloted 
to my Security patrols!” 

“A good point, Shluh. The Mark 
XXI’s will frisk every attender from 
socks to hair-piece. Of course, a little 
poison in the caterer’s salt-shaker 
wouldn’t trip the detectors, but the 
metabolic monitors would catch that 
on the routine analysis that’s run on 
food to be sure it’s safe for alien 
consumption. So the Borgia approach 
is out, too.” 

“I tire of your theorizing!” ^Shluh 
was on his feet. “Think what you 
will! I tell you in confidence: Even 
now your Chancery is surrounded by 
my troops — ostensibly as honor 
guard — but none can leave or enter! 
By this hour tomorrow no Terry 
will dare to show his naked face 
in any capital in the Sector — 

“Tomorrow, eh?” Retief nodded. 
‘Thanks for giving me your time- 
table.” 

“Have done, infamous meddler 
in the destinies of Groac! But before 
you die, tell me the name of the 
spy who sold you our secrets, and I 
shall personally supervise his im- 
palement on the wall of one thou- 
sand hooks!”

IF 




“Secrets, eh? I guess that confirms 
my guesswork,” Retief said. “One 
more question: What pay-off do the 
Blugs get — ” 

“Silence!” Shluh keened. “Be as- 
sured your brief remaining hours will 
be devoted not to questioning mat- 
ters of policy beyond your grasp, but 
to supplying detailed answers to a 
number of queries of my own!” 

“Wrong again,” Retief said and 
took a step toward the desk on 
which the police officer leaned, shak- 
ing a gloved fist. Shluh jumped 
back, motioned to the armed guard 
standing by, who swung his power 
gun to the ready, aimed at Retief s 
face. 

“Haven’t your lads been told that 
you can’t fire a blaster in an en- 
closed space like this without in- 
cinerating everything in it, including 
the shooter?” Retief asked casually, 
and took another step. The guard 
lowered the gun hesitantly, his eyes 
twitching in confusion. 

“He lies, cretinous hive-mate of 
broodfoulers! Fire!” Shluh screeched, 
and ducked to snatch at an open 
drawer. Retief reached him in a 
bound, caught the unfortunate cap- 
tain by the neck, sent him skidding 
toward the guard as a belated shot 
lit the room like a photoflash. As 
the two Groaci went down in a heap, 
Retief caught up the dropped gun. 

“Well, another myth exploded,” he 
said. “Shluh, take off your belt and 
strap him up.” With the gun cover- 
ing the two aliens, he seated him- 
self at the desk, flipped up the OUT 
key on the desk field-phone, punch- 
ed in a number. A moment later, the 
glum face of Counsellor of Embassy 



Clutchplate appeared on the screen. 
He giaped. 

“Retief! What — how — Do you 
realize — ? Did you actually — ? 
How could you have ...” his voice 
faltered as he took in the scene in 
the background. “Isn’t that Chief 
Shluh? What’s he doing?’ 

“He just ran into an old acquain- 
tance,” Retief soothed, ignoring a 
sharp rap at the door. “Mr. Clutch- 
plate, how far along are the ar- 
rangements for Blug participation in 
the Conference?” 

^4TTThy, their delegation will ar- 
▼ V rive within the hour. The 
convoy just ’vised Port Authority 
for landing clearance. But see 
here — ” 

“Convoy?” Retief glanced up as 
pounding sounded at the door. 

“Just fifty first-class cruisers; as 
escort for the transport. The Blug 
never travel unarmed, you know. 
But — ” 

“See if you can get the ambassador 
to turn them down,” Retief rapped. 
“Failing that, meet ’em with an 
armed guard and — ” 

“Mr. Retief!” the counsellor bark- 
ed. “I don’t know what mad scheme 
you’ve embarked on, but it won’t 
work! I know how you feel about 
the Blugs, and the Groaci too, for 
that matter. But taking the law into 
your own hands — ” 

“No time for any long discussions, 
Mr. Clutchplate,” Retief cut in as a 
heavy thud rocked the door. “I’d 
ask you for a squad of Marines if I 
knew where I was, but — ” 

“Turn yourself in,” Clutchplate 
blurted. “It’s the only way. You

can plead guilty due to temiporary 
insanity brought on by outraged 
political convictions, and get off with 
no more than half a dozen years on 
a penal satellite.” 

“It’s an interesting proposal.” Re- 
lief ducked as splinters of door 
whined past his head. “What am I 
guilty of?” 

“Murder, of course,” Clutchplate 
yelped. “Two Sulinorians, remem- 
ber?” 

“It slipped my mind,” Relief said. 
“But see if you can hold the charge 
open a little longer. I may have a 
few Groaci to add to it.” He flipped 
off the screen as the door shudder- 
ed and bulged inward. 

“Time for you to talk fast, Shluh,” 
he said crisply. “Tve decided to slip 
out the back way to avoid the auto- 
graph hounds. There are three doors 
I could use. You’ll tell me which 
one’s the best route.” 

“Never!” 

Relief fired a bolt from the hip 
past the Groaci. 

“On the other hand,” Shluh hissed 
quickly, “what matter if you tempo- 
rarily elude my overzealous troops? 
Our plans will proceed — and the 
measures you sought to set in motion 
will avail naught to stop them!” He 
darted to a side door, keyed it open. 

“Go, then, Retief! But take what 
path you will, a dreadful end awaits 
you!” 

“In that case, you’d better go 
first.” Shluh hissed and tried to dart 
aside, but Retief caught him, pro- 
pelled him ahead with a foot in the 
seat. He slammed and barred the 
panel behind him, as the outer door 
fell in with a crash. 



T hey followed dim, dusty pas- 
sages, ascended winding stair- 
ways, moved silently along dark, 
lofty halls lined with ancient armor 
and hung with rotted banners. Half 
a dozen times. Retief eluded Groaci 
search parties by a hair’s breadth. In 
a wide room decorated with painted 
murals showing centauroids cavorting 
on purple grass, Shluh gestured 
toward a high-arched, doorless open- 
ing (through which pale moonlight 
gleamed. 

‘There is your exit to the night, 
Retief!” he keened sardonically. 
“Make what use of it you will! The 
way is clear!” 

Retief crossed the room, stepped 
out onto a tiny balcony, thick with 
the droppings of the tiny bat-like 
creatures that wheeled and skreelod 
at his appearance. Ragged vines 
grew over a low balustrade, beyond 
which darkness spread to a skyline 
of tower-encrusted hills. He looked 
down. The wall dropped sheer into 
inky shadows far below. 

“Thanks for everything, Shluh.” 
He threw a leg over the stone rail- 
ing. “I’ll see you at your trial — 
if your bosses let you live that long, 
after the way you’ve botched your 
assignment.” 

“Stop, impetuous outworlder!” 
Shluh keened, as Groaci feet clicked 
in the room behind him. “Even 
sfhould you survive the descent, you 
know not what you do! Not even you 
would I urge on to what waits in the 
darkness below!” 

“You mean your short patrols?” 
“Not my patrols, nor the Marines

your own embassy which even 
now seek you, warrant in hand> will 
ever find you, if once you set foot 
in those demon-haunted byways!” 

“So that’s where you set up your 
jail-house?” Retief looked thought- 
ful. “Still, I’d rather mingle with 
spooks than go back to your little 
party. Ta-ta, Shluh. Stay as sweet as 
you are.” Shluh hit the deck as Re- 
tief raised the gun and fired a burst 
toward the approaching search 
party, slung the blast rifle over his 
shoulder and started down toward 
the silent streets of the Forbidden 
City. 

yt was an easy climb. Once a pair 
X of Groaci heads appeared over the 
balcony rail above, but they drew 
back quickly. The wall was deeply 
carved, and the stout vines provided 
ample hand- and foot-holds. It was 
less than ten minutes before Retief 
swung down and dropped the last 
few feet into a mass of unpruned 
shrubbery from which he emerged 
on an avenue of marble mansions 
like abandoned funeral homes. The 
two pale moons of Sulinore came 
from behind a cloud and shone down 
ghostly white. Something small and 
dark flitted overhead, emitting thin 
cries. Far away, a mournful wail 
sounded. Retief set off at a brisk 
walk, his footsteps echoing hollow- 
ly on the worn mosaics that paved 
the way. 

Ahead, a lofty obelisk reared up. 
The inscription, nearly effaced by 
time, seemed to commemorate a bat- 
tle fought with giants. At the next 
corner, the carved heads of ogres 
peered blindly down at him from an 



ornate cornice. He passed a fountain, 
diy and silent, where finned and tail- 
ed maidens of stone disported them- 
selves amid marble waves. The dank 
wind blew dead leaves along the 
street. As Retief paused, a sound 
as of small feet pattered for a mo- 
ment, then fell silent. 

“Come on out,” Retief called. 
“There’s some news you ought to 
hear.” 

There was a ghostly laughter — 
or perhaps it was only the wind, 
searching among the fluted columns 
of a temple. Retief went on. Round- 
ing an abrupt angle, he caught a 
glimpse of movement — a darting 
shape that disappeared into a gaping 
doorway. He followed, found him- 
self in a hall, open to the sky. From 
its walls, giant frescoed figures star- 
ed down with empty eyes. 

“I need a guide,” , Retief called. 
“Any volunteers?” 

“Tears . tears . tears,” the 
echoes rolled back from every side. 

“There’s a small matter of an in- 
vasion to deal with right now.” 

“Now . now . now . .” the 
sound faded and died, and as if the 
word were a signal, a creak sounded 
from the high doors through which 
Retief had entered. 

He spun in time to -see them clash 
shut with a dull boom that echoed 
and re-echoed. He went to them, 
found them jammed tight, immova- 
ble. He turned back to the interior 
of the roofless room. A wide pas- 
sage was visible at the rear. Skitting 
a black pool that reflected a shatter- 
ed moon, he entered the passage, 
emerged after twenty paces on a 
terrace above a flight of wide, shal-

low steps. Below, a dark and wild- 
grown park spread out, a wilderness 
of untrimmed shrubs and lofty, black- 
leaved trees. 

He descended to the foot-high 
sward; soft rustlings from the sha- 
dows retreated as he advanced along 
a weed-obscured path winding 
among the buttressed trunks of 
patriarchal trees. Carved faces leer- 
ed at him from the shadows. The 
eerie shapes of stone monsters gleam- 
ed through the unpruned foliage. He 
emerged onto a broad mall along 
the center of which a double rank 
of what appeared to be painted sta- 
tues of heroic size were drawn up 
along an aisle that led away into the 
nigjht. Near at hand, a small col- 
lonaded shrine was almost hidden 
among the low-sweeping boughs of a 
giant conifer. Silently, Retief ap- 
proached the building from the side. 

Through a latticed opening, faint 
moonlight fell on the vine-entwined 
effigy of an oversized Sulinorian 
in the armor of an ancient warrior. 
In the darkness behind the graven 
hero, something moved minutely. Re- 
lief tossed a pebble through the 
window, flattened himself against the 
wall by the doorway. A moment 
later, a head poked cautiously from 
the entry — and Retiefs hand 
clamped on the slender Sulinorian 
neck. 

“Pardon my interrupting the 
game,” he said. “But it’s time we had 
a talk.” 

V 

^4np'he price of entrance into the 
A Sacred Grove of Heroes is 



death, Terran!” the tenor voice of 
the alien shrilled. 

“So I understand,” Retief said, 
holding his catch at arm’s length to 
avoid the wildly kicking feet. “How- 
ever, my little intrusion is nothing 
compared with what the Groaci have 
scheduled. Maybe you’d better listen 
to what I have to say before you 
carry out the sentence.” 

“Tomorrow is nothing; the past is 
all,” the Sulinorian declaimed. “Why 
struggle against Destiny, out- 
worlder?” 

“We can give destiny a run for 
her money if you’ll spread the word 
that I need a few hundred able- 
bodied Sulinorians to distract the 
Groaci patrols long enough for me 
to get through to the Terry Embas- 
sy — ” 

“Offer your final devotions to your 
gods, man of Terra,” the Sulinorian 
cut in. “Your fate is sealed.” 

“You’re consistent, I’ll concede 
that,” Retief said. “It looks as 
though I’ll have to look a little far- 
ther for a public-spirited citizen.” 
He released the native, who jerked 
his varicolored toga straight and 
faced him defiantly. 

“Not so, Terran!” The local fold- 
ed his knobby arms. “Never will you 
leave these hallowed precincts!” 
Rustlings sounded behind Retief. 
He turned. From every shadowed 
clump of shrubbery, a Sulinorian 
emerged; light winked from the foot- 
long stilettoes in their hands. Silent- 
ly, the ring of aliens closed in. Retief 
backed to the shrine, unlimbered 
the blast rifle, swung it to cover the 
throng which halted, facing him. 
“Welcome to the party,” he said. 

IF

“Now that we’ve got a quorum, may- 
be we’ll get somew'here.” 

“You outrage the glorious past, 
Terran,’’ a wizened Sulinorian quav- 
ered, staring up at Retief. “You heap 
outrage on outrage!” 

“The outrage the Groaci are plan- 
ning is the one I’m concerned with,” 
Retief said. “You people don’t seem 
to care much, but from the Terry 
viewpoint, it might set an unfortun- 
ate precedent for other budding em- 
pire-builders.” 

“Terry, gone are the days when 
we of Sulinore were mighty warriors. 
If now it falls our lot to die, we face 
our fate in dignity.” 

“There’s nothing dignified about 
being scragged by the Groaci, or 
strung up by the heels by a platoon 
of Blugs,” Retief cut in. “I hear 
they have a curious sense of humor 
when it comes to dealing with any- 
one who’s proved his inferiority by 
getting conquered by them.” 

“Kill this alien at once, isn’t it?” 
a scratchy-voiced Sulinorian in the 
front rank called. “After, everybody 
die nicely, as scheduled.” 

“Enough talk,” the elderly Sulino- 
rian declared. “Let the disturber of 
the sleep of heroes suffer the penal- 
ty!” 

The Sulinorians eyed the gun in 
Retief’s hands, shuffled their feet. 
No one advanced. 

“Maybe you’d better call the 
penalty off,” Retief suggested. “Then 
you can divert your righteous indig- 
nation into doing something about 
the invasion.” 

“Hmmmm.” The elderly spokes- 
man beckoned to a couple of his 
fellows; they put their heads together. 



“We have decided,” the oldster 
stated as the conference ended, 
“that the matter must be referred to 
the Old Ones for decision.” He 
raised a trembling hand. “Not that 
we fear to fall under your murderous 
weap>on, Terran — but it is a death 
which lacks elegance.” He waved a 
hand and an avenue opened up 
through the dense ranks of armed 
locals. 

“Terran, I give you temporary 
safe-conduct and the honor of con- 
frontation with the Ancient Lords 
of Sulinore, who will themselves 
dispose of this case. Come, if you 
fear not I” 

“Fair enough,” Retief said. “When 
you want fast action, there’s nothing 
like going direct to the top brass. 
Where do we find them?” 

“Behold the Lords of Sulinore!” 
the ancient piped feebly. The locals 
made sweeping bows to the ranks of 
still figures about them. Retief in- 
clined his head respectfully. 

‘They cut an impressive figure,” 
he said. “I’ll be interested to see 
how they go about dealing with the 
problem at hand.” 

44Qimplicity itself,” the old Sulino- 

O rian said. “One waft of the 
sacred incense, and a faint shadow 
of their vanished vitality will ener- 
gize them. Then will they hear our 
pleas and hand down justice in the 
ancient way.” 

Retief walked slowly along the 
row of motionless effigies, noting 
the worn trappings, the realistically 
scarred limbs and fierce visages, the 
tarnished armor of the ancient war- 
riors. In spite of their size and

varied farms, all bore some resem- 
blance to the shrunken SuJiinorians 
who followed, silent and awed. 

“Once the races of Sulinore were 
many,” the ancient said as he noticed 
Relief’s questing gaze. “And mighty 
was their prowess. 

‘There stands 2^briale the In- 
tense, Requiter of Wrongs. Beyond, 
we see proud Valingrave, victor at 
Har and Jungulon and Spagetwrai- 
die. Here — ” he indicated the 
modest crypt “ — behold the shrine 
of Bozdune the Restial, known also 
as Bozdune the Baresark, of fero- 
cious memory. And there — ” he 
pointed to a four-legged, barrel- 
chested creature with a typical Suli- 
norian torso and head “ — stand the 
mortal remains of Great Tussore, 
he who single-handed vanquished 
the hordes of Doss, on a world so 
distant that even now the sunlight 
of his day of battle has not yet 
reached the face of Sulinore!” 

“He looks like a tough boy,” Re- 
lief commented. “Too bad he’s not 
still around. He might take a dim 
view of the way things are going.” 

“Did I not say Mighty Tussore 
would give his judgment? Aye, and 
Cranius the August, and Maglodore 
the Swift, and Belgesion, and Vare, 
and High Pranthippo, King of 
Kings — ” 

“A most august assemblage,” Re- 
lief conceded. “But they seem a 
rather taciturn group.” 

“You jape at the Lords of Suli- 
Bore, Terran?” The oldster drew 
himself up, made an imperious ges- 
ture. A pair of locals nearly as old 
as himself came forward, bearing a 
large case which they placed on the 



grass, opening the lid. Inside was a 
cylindrical tank fitted with valves 
and a coil of flexible plastic tubing. 
The dodderer lifted the nozzle erf 
the hose, advanced to the pedestal 
on which the centauroid stood. 

“Awaken, Great Tussore!” he 
cried in his cracked voice. “Rouse 
from thy long dreams to render judg- 
ment on one who comes unbidden 
to the Place of Heroes!” He raised 
the hose and waved it under the flar- 
ed nostrils. Retief heard a faint hiss 
of escaping gas. 

“Give us of thy ancient wisdom 
as in days of old, O Tussore,” the 
old fellow exhorted. He shoved the 
hose closer. “Almost is the sacred 
effluvium exhausted,” he muttered. 
“I’ll bet a pretty some of these back- 
sliders have been tapping it on the 
sly.” 

S uddenly one pointed ear of the 
statue twitched. The flared nos- 
trils quivered. The eyelids fluttered. 
As Retief watched, the lips parted. 

“Glop,” the mighty figure said, 
and fell silent. 

“Drat it, what a time for the tank 
to run out,” someone beside Retief 
muttered. 

“How does he work it?” Retief in- 
quired softly as the Keeper of the 
Sacred Fumes waved the hose agi- 
tatedly, vainly invoking the unmov- 
ing demigod. 

“We work nothing, interloper,” 
the Sulinorian said sullenly. “A good 
shot of sacred gas, and their me- 
tabolism starts ticking over fast 
enough to start them talking, that’s 
all.” 

Abruptly, Tussore stirred again.

IF 




“The devil take the blackguards,” a 
deep voice suddenly rumbled from 
his chest. “Where’s my greaves? 
Where’s my fetlock powder? Where’s 
my confounded mace? Blast that but- 
ter-fingered squire . 

“Great Tussore, wake from thy 
dreams!” The hosewielder redoubled 
his efforts. “Hear me! Even now 
there stands in our midst a stranger 
wbo violates the honored rest of the 
Lords of Sulinore with his presence!” 

“Oh . it’s you, Therion,” Tus- 
sore mumbled. His eyes were open 
now, bleary and dull. “You look ter- 
rible. Been a long time, I guess. And 
it’s not the stranger who disturbs my 
rest — it’s you, with your infernal 
babbling!” He reached, plucked the 
hose from the oldster’s hand, jammed 
it under his nose, drew a deep breath. 

“Ahhhh! That’s what the doctor 
ordered.” 

“Even so. Great Tussore!” The 
Sulinorian proceeded to relate the 
circumstances surrounding Retiefs 
presence. Halfway through the re- 
cital, Tussore’s eye-lids drooped. The 
hose fell from his hand. He snored. 

“So the problem. Great One, is 
how to administer the prescribed 
rituals without suffering the inde- 
corum of being mowed down like 
ripe beer-corn by the condemned 
one,” the oldster concluded. “Great 
Tussore? Mighty one?” He waved 
the hose frantically, but his efforts 
this time were unavailing. The still 
figure stood, unmoving as a sphinx. 

4CQo much for the wisdom of the 

O ages,” Relief said. “Nice try, 
Theiion, but it looks like the Ora- 
cle’s not interested. Let’s go.” 



“Make silent this one, plenty 
quick!” a small Sulinorian rasped — 
^ same one. Relief thought, who 
had spoken up earlier. “No more 
time for pulling string on wooden 
god! Cut away the head of this 
Terry, yes! And soon after, fates pro- 
ceed on schedule!” 

“Silence, impertinent oaf!” Ther- 
ion rounded on the speaker. “Your 
cacophonous squeakings impugn the 
majesties of Sulinore! Give me your 
name, for later disciplining!” 

The one addressed backed away, 
looking flustered, as if suddenly o>n- 
scious of being conspicuous. Relief 
studied his face. 

“Well, if it isn’t my old friend 
Coriale,” he said. “You ought to be 
an expert on the subject of dying. 
Seems to me I’ve seen you expire 
twice already this evening.” 

The Coriale-faced alien whirled 
suddenly, plunged for the rear rank. 

“Seize him!” Therion called. The 
quarry ducked, dodged, dived 
through a gap in the suddenly surg- 
ing ranks, scuttled sideways as his 
retreat was cut off, made a dash 
for the shrubbery. The chase pound- 
ed off into the underbrush. Relief 
seated himself on a convenient pedes- 
tal and lit a dope-stick. Five minutes 
passed before the crowd again surged 
into view, the darting quarry still 
in the lead. He put on a sprint, 
scuttled to the shrine, dived inside. 

“His impiety passes all bounds!” 
Therion puffed, coming up to Re- 
lief. “Now the mad creature seeks 
fibditer in the very crypt of Boz- 
dimel” 

“Let 'him be fetched out and dealt 
with!” someone shrilled.

“Stay!” Therion piped as the 
aroused crowd closed in. “We’ll not 
bring dishonor to the hero by scuf- 
fling about his feet. Come! Let us 
•withdraw and leave this fevered 
maniac to regain his senses among 
the shadows of the greatness which 
was his race’s!” 

R elief took out his pocket light 
and played the beam between 
the columns of the refugee’s hiding 
place. Between the great steel -toed 
boots of Bozdune, a smaller pair of 
feet was visible. He directed the light 
higher. 

“Correction,” he said. “Not his . 
race’s; that’s no Sulinorian. Look.” 
The light revealed a cloud of brown 
mist coiling upwards around the 
rigid features of the preserved hero. 
“The meeting’s been infiltrated by 
a masquerading alien — an alien 
who exhales brown gas when he gets 
excited.” 

“What’s this? Brown gas — ?” 
Therion’s question was interrupted 
by a startled cry from a Sulinorian 
near the temple entry, followed a 
moment later by a snort like a teased 
bull. 

“He stirs! Bozdune rouses!” Sud- 
denly Sulinorians were running in 
every direction. Relief caught Ther- 
ion’s arm as the elder turned to 
follow the general flight. 

“Unhand me, fellow!” the oldster 
screeched as a bellow sounded from 
the shrine. “Death I face with a 
proud smile — but there’s some- 
thing inappropriate about being 
ripped limb from limb by an ances- 
tor!” 

“Is that the kind of fellow you 



make a hero of?” Relief inquired as 
smashing sounds emanated from the 
crypt, followed by the hurtling body 
of the Coriale double, which skidded 
to Relief’s feet and lay moving 
feebly. 

“Unfortunately Bozdune lost his 
wits as a result of three month’s 
exposure to the Tickling Torture at 
the hands of the infamous Kreee,” 
Therion explained hastily. “He’s 
prone to rages, when suddenly 
aroused, and prudence demands my 
swift removal hence!” He pulled free 
and bounded away with an agility re- 
markable in a being of his age. Re- 
lief turned as a rumble of falling 
stone sounded from the shrine. A 
mighty figure had appeared between 
the columns, stood with hands press- 
ed against them. Great cords of 
muscle stood out on his neck; his 
biceps bulged; his latissimi dorsi 
strained. The column buckled and 
went over, bringing down a section 
of the architrave. Bozdune roared 
as the marble slab bounced from 
his back. With a final thrust, he 
toppled a second column, stepped 
forth as stone collapsed behind him. 
Eight feet high, massive as a buffalo, 
he stood in the moonlight, snarling. 
His wild gaze fell on Relief. 

“Kreee!” he bellowed. “I have you 
now!” and charged the lone Terran. 

VI 

R elief stood his ground as Boz- 
dune closed in. 

“You’ve got me confused with 
someone else, Bozdune,” he called. 
“I’m just a Terry doing a little job 
of planet-saving.”

IF 




With a bellow, the ancient fighter 
thundered past the spot where Re- 
tief had stood a moment before. He 
fought his way clear of the under- 
brush into which the momentum of 
his dash had carried him, rounded 
on his elusive prey. 

“And in that connection. I’d like 
to ask a little favor of you,” Retief 
continued. “A group of opportunists 
called the Groaci are planning to 
massacre all the foreign diplomats 
in town — ” 

“Arrrrghhhl” Bozdune roared and 
closed in swinging roundhouse swipes 
sufficient to decapitate a horse. Re- 
tief leaned aside from one wild 
swing, ducked under another, plant- 
ed his feet and drove a solid left- 
right to the giant’s stomach, an ef- 
fect like punching a sea-wall. He 
jumped aside as Bozdune grunted 
and made an ineffective grab, land- 
ing a blow in his own midriff that 
staggered him. 

“Now, the Groaci have the streets 
cordoned off,” Retief went on. “And 
since it’s important that I get 
through to the Embassy with the 
news. I’d like to ask you to lend a 
hand.” He stepped back as Bozdune 
ripped his six-foot blade from its 
sheath, whirled it overhead. Retief 
tossed the last rifle aside, plucked 
a wristthick spear from the grip of a 
horned warrior which loomed immo- 
bile beside him. Bozdune made a 
bound, brought the massive claymore 
down in a whistling arc that cleaved 
air an inch to Retief’s right as he 
faded aside. 

“Now, if you’d just say a word to 
your descendants, I think they might 
consent to lend a hand.” Retief 



poked the spear hard against Boz- 
dune’s breastplate. “How about it?” 

Bozdune dropped his sword, 
grabbed the spear shaft with both 
hands, and gave a prodigious pull — 
and as Retief let go, tottered back- 
ward, tripped over a fragment of 
shattered column and went down 
like a fallen oak. Retief heard the 
dull thonk! as his head struck the 
marble steps of his erstwhile shel- 
ter. He stepped quickly forward. 
Used the warrior’s own harness straps 
to bind his wrists together, then his 
ankles. At that moment, the bushes 
parted and Therion’s aged face ap- 
peared. 

“What transpires?” he piped. His 
eye fixed on the prone giant. “What, 
Bozdune the Bestial, felled by a 
mere outworlder?” 

“I’m afraid I can’t claim the 
glory,” Retief said. “He ran out of 
gas.” He glanced toward the spot 
where the false Coriale had lain. 
“But if you can find the ringer, I 
may be able to remedy that.” 

“He’s here, the infamous dastard,” 
a Sulinorian called, dragging the un- 
fortunate imposter from a clump of 
gorse. Retief got a grip on the cap- 
tive’s collar, assisted him to Boz- 
dune’s side. 

“Breathe on the nice man. Shor- 
ty,” he ordered. 

A great gout of brown gas puffed 
obediently forth. 

“Again.” 

The prisoner huffed and puffed, 
exhaling the vapor past the fallen 
fighter’s snoring visage. In a moment, 
Bozdune twitched, jerked and opened 
his eyes. 

“You’re still here, eh?” he said to

Relief. “I thought I dreamed you,” 
He sniffed again. 

“Gadzoons, first good air I’ve 
breathed in a couple hundred years. 
More!” He raised his voice as Relief 
withdrew the pseudo-Coriale. 

“Not unless you agree to lend a 
hand,” Relief ^countered. “Then I 
promise you all the sacred essence 
you want.” 

“Are you kidding? Just let me get 
my hands on these Gruckles or who- 
ever they are that think they can 
carve my home town up, and I’ll 
grind them into library paste!” 

“It’s a deal. Relief turned to Ther- 
ion. “How about it? You in or out?” 
“If Bozdune approves the enter- 
prise, then who are we to demur?” 
the oldster inquired of the cool night 
air. “Rise, loyal Sons of Sulinore! 
For this night at least, the ancient 
glories live again!” 

Retiei gave Bozdune another shot 
of gas, then passed the captive to 
Therion. 

“Don’t squeeze him too hard,” 
he cautioned. “We’ve got to make 
him stretch as far as we can; if this 
caper’s going to succeed, we’ll need 
all the ancient glory we can muster.” 

F rom a shadowy arch half a block 
from the carved gates of the 
Terran Embassy, Relief, seated as- 
tride Tussore’s broad back, watched 
as the fifty-Groaci guard detail 
sauntered past, their stemmed eyes 
scanning the street alertly, their blast 
rifles ready at port arms. Behind him, 
the tread of booted Groaci feet ap- 
proached relentlessly. 

“Get ready,” he said softly. “An- 
other ten seconds . .” 



There was a chorus of weak shouts 
from the rear, a slapping of running 
feet, the buzzzz-whapp! of power 
guns firing; then a pair of Groaci 
troopers appeared, pelting along in 
advance of a mighty figure in anci- 
ent armor. In full stride, he over- 
took them, snatched them up by 
their necks and tossed them aside. 
Behind him, a crowd of Sulinorians, 
toga skirts hitched high, brandished 
their ceremonial knives as they fol- 
lowed their massive leader toward 
the gate. A moment later, the giant 
was among the patrollers, flailing 
with a spike-studded mace before a 
gun was fired. 

“Let’s go!” Relief kicked his heels 
into Tussore’s sides, and the mighty 
centauroid bounded forward. In an 
instant, they were in the thick of the 
melee. Relief swinging a yard-long 
club as Tussore reared and struck 
out with iron-hard hooves. 

“Cut your way through!” Relief 
called to his mount. We can mop up 
later, after we’ve taken care of the 
main event!” 

“Aiii! What a lovely squishing 
sound these Gruckers make beneath 
my hooves!” the old warrior yelled, 
but he wheeled and charged the gate. 
Half a block away. Relief caught a 
glimpse of Bozdune, tossing Groaci 
troopers aside like straw dummies. 
From every dark alleymouth and by- 
way, Sulinorians were pouring. A 
lone Groaci in the gatehouse brought 
up his blast-rifle, loosed a round 
that missed by inches; then Reliefs 
club felled him, and they were 
through, crossing the lawn toward 
the lighted entry at full gallop. A 
startled Marine guard let out a yell

and reached for the lever which 
would slam the grill in the faces of 
the invaders, but a sweep of Tus- 
sore’s arm sent the sentry sprawling. 
Inside, Relief swung down, started 
up the grand staircase, five steps at a 
time. Suddenly Counsellor Clutch- 
plate appeared on the landing above. 

^^Uetief!” His eyes took in the 

IV massive, sweaty, horse-bodied 
Tussore, helmed and sword-girded, 
the motley horde of Sulinorians 
swarming behind. 

“Good lord! Treason! Treachery! 
Hallucinations!” He whirled to run 
as Relief caught him, spun him 
around. 

“Has the banquet begun yet?” he 
demanded. 

“J . j . just starting now,” 
the counsellor choked. “It happens 
I don’t like Groaci iodine chowder, 
so I just stepped out for a breath of 
air.” He stumbled back as Relief 
dashed on. 

At the high double doors to the 
banquet hall, a Marine in dress blues, 
polished helmet and chrome-plated 
ceremonial .45 departed from his 
rigid position of attention sufficient- 
ly to roll his eyes as the newcomers 
surged down on him. At what he 
saw, he grabbed for the holster at 
his hip. Relief slammed a side-hand- 
ed blow at his wrist. “Sorry, son,” 
he snapped and sent the doors flying 
open on the roomful of startled dip- 
lomats. From both sides of a long 
U-shaped table, oculars of every 
description goggled at the spectacle 
that burst upon them. Retief point- 
ed to the impassive Sulinorian servi- 
tors standing behind the diners. 



spaced all along the room, one to a 
customer. 

“Get ’em” he commanded and 
reached for the nearest as the troop 
at his heels boiled past to carry out 
his instruction. 

VU 

^ ou’ve gone out of your mind, 
Jl Retief!” Counsellor Clutch- 
plate gazed, white-faced and shaken, 
from the broken doorway at the 
scene of carnage after the capture 
of the last of the servitors. “What 
can it mean, leading this party of 
dacoits to violate the Embassy? I 
must protest, even at risk of my 
life, whatever atrocities you plan to 
visit on these poor chaps! They’re 
under CDT protection!” 

“They’ll survive — some of ’em,” 
Retief said, and plucking a steak 
knife from the table, he stooped 
over one of the fallen waiters and 
with a quick stroke, laid him open 
from chin to navel. Clutchplate ut- 
tered a strangled yelp; Ambassador 
Shindlesweet turned pale and quietly 
collapsed under the table as Retief 
reached, extracted a limp, two-foot- 
tall creature resembling a shelled 
lobster from the interior of the 
pseudoflesh costume. 

“They’re not Sulinorians; they’re 
Slugs.” He reached again, pulled out 
a small pressure-tank. “This is his 
air supply; liquid nitrogen.” 

“Slugs?” Clutchplate gaped at the 
unconscious creature, from whose 
breathing orifice a brown exhalation 
now was issuing. “Sut what — 
how — ? See here, Retief! even if 
these are, er, Slugs, what harm 



74 



IF 




could they have done unarmed, 
which would warrant your outrage- 
ous behavior?” 

“Blugs are rock-eaters,” Retief ex- 
plained. “And they seem to have a 
remarkable degree of control over 
their metabolism. Normally, they ex- 
hale innocuous gases; under stress, 
they start exhaling nitrogen trioxide. 
But when occasion demands, they 
can switch to production of any one 
of three or four poisonous oxides of 
nitrogen. Here in this closed room, 
all it would have taken was one good 
whiff down each guest’s neck, on 
signal, and bingo! Clean sweep.” 

“But why?” Clutchplate wailed. 

“1 have an idea Ambassador 
Shith can tell us how they happened 
to be here, instead of Coriale’s regu- 
lar table-waiting staff,” Retief sug- 
gested. 

Shith, still dangling in Tussore’s 
grasp, emitted a harsh bleat. “Gloat 
while you can, Mr. Retief!” he 
hissed. “True, every word! I com- 
mend your cleverness! But while you 
spent your efforts in thwarting this 
feint — yes, feint! — the squadron 
of Blug warships which you Terries 
so naively permitted to pass your 
blockade were discharging fifty thou- 
sand picked troops, the cream of the 
Bluggish navy! Even now these 
diminutive but doughty doughboys 
are spreading out over the town, 
breathing their deadly halitosis on 
every living creature in their paths! 
By morning, no Sulinorian will be 
alive to dispute the Groaci claim to 
planetary ownership!” 

4 40hith — have you taken leave 

O of your senses?” Shindle- 



sweet had revived sufficiently to 
crawl forth, spluttering. “When this 
is known you’ll be hauled before a 
Galactic tribunal and dealt with in a 
manner that will make the name of 
Groac a byword to replace that of 
Doctor Mush!” 

“Mud,” Shith corrected. “Permit 
me to contradict you, my dear 
George! Not one word of the coup 
will be noised abroad. My constabu- 
lary have already taken the pre- 
caution of securing the only com- 
munications facilities on the planet 
capable of contacting CDT naval 
forces; in a matter of moments my 
chaps will arrive to put an end to 
your illusions of success! Don’t fret, 
however. I promise you a swift and 
painless demise.” He paused, aiming 
several eyes at Retief. “Why do you 
shake your head, sir! My scheme is 
flawless! My invasion is an accom- 
plished fact!” 

“True — but you missed one 
small point,” Retief said. “The Suli- 
norians were gradually fading off the 
scene due to the exhaustion of the 
planet’s supply of a certain element 
yital to their well-being. But instead 
of dying, after about the age of five 
hundred, they’d drift off into a coma- 
tose state. You and your nitrogen- 
fixing Blugs have changed all that, 
Mr. Ambassador. Thanks to you, 
Suldnore has a new lease on life.” 

“You seek even in the eleventh 
hour to delude yourself!” Shith 
hissed. “Hearken! Even now my oc- 
cupation forces approach the door!” 

There was a noisy clump of feet 
from the hall outside. 

Then the migjhty figure of Boz- 
dune the Bestial, broad and bronzed.

appeared in the eoitry. He plucked 
a shattered door from its hinges with 
one hand and tosssed it aside. 

“Nice going, Refcief,” he boomed. 
“I don’t know how you WOTked it, 
but the place is swarming wth those 
lovable little guys you called Blugs. 
All the boys are catching ’em and 
making pets of ’em. I’ve got one in 
my pocket, and he’s keeping me 
supplied like a tall glunthound!” The 
behemoth’s ochre eyes fell on the 
laden table. “Chow!” he bassooned. 
“I haven’t had a square meal in 
eight hundred years!” 

“Then — this means my invasion 
has failed?” Shith wailed. “My so- 
meticulously planned invasion, spoil- 
ed in the eleventh hour by one trivial 
oversight?” 

“Qh, your invasion is a huge suc- 
cess,” Retief said comfortingly. “But

on the platform where the group of 
local and foreign dignitaries stood, 
awaiting the appearance of the pa- 
rade organized by the Sulinorians to 
celebrate the invasion. “I demand 
the immediate return of the im- 
pounded units of the Blug navy and 
the repatriation of all Blug nation- 
als!’* 

“Spare me your threnodies, my 
dear Shith.” Ambassador Shindle- 
sweet raised a remonstrative hand. 
“We’d have a sticky time of it were 
we to attempt to dislodge the Blugs 
now. You’re aware. I’m sure, diat 
as their breathing tanks ran low, 
they escaped their captors and bur- 
rowed their way down half a mile 
to a nitrogen-rich stratum and are 
busily digesting rock and releasing 
free radicals — that, and reproduc- 
ing. I think you might be said to be 
fortunate to be sharing the honors 
today as co-sponsor of the Blug 
Immigration Plan, rather than lan- 
guishing in the VIP suite of a CDT 
brig, awaiting trial.” 

“Pah!” the Groaci envoy vibrated 
his throat-sac in indignation. “In 
that case,” he changed tack, “I see 
no reason why Groac should share 
credit for this enlightened program 
under which, at no cost to these un- 
grateful locals, their atmosphere is 
being so rapidly renewed!” 

“Really, Shith,” the Terran chief 
of mission said in a low voice, “it’s 
only the fact that a full disclosure 
of the events leading up to the pres- 
ent rapprochement might tempt cer- 
tain petty critics at Sector to the 
faulty conclusion that I had been 
in some way remiss, that prevents

the rather excited pronouncement 
which you so providently delivered 
into the recorders set up to capture 
the after-dinner speeches . He 
cupped an ear as distant bugles 
sounded “Gentlemen, I think I hear 
them coming now.” 

A long the ancient street, a pro- 
cession was advancing, banners 
awave. In the front rank were Tus- 
sore and Bozdune, grim and gigan- 
tic, CDT-supplied nitrogen Tanks 
slung at their hips, their armor 
sparkling in the red rays of the swol- 
len sun. 

Behind them, rank on rank, 
marched the revived immortals of 
Sulinore, a column that stretched 
away out of sight along the shadowy 
street. 

“This matter of allowing these 
chaps to seize the Blug ships as spoils 
of war and set off on a raiding ex- 
pedition is an irregularity that I’m 
going to have difficulty glossing over 
in my report,” Shindlesweet said be- 
hind his hand to Therion. “But off 
the record,” he added, “I suppose 
rU manage — so long as you’re sure 
they’ll do their raiding in Groaci- 
mandated territory.” 



“Indeed, I hope you’ll interpose 
no obstacles to the ruffians departing 
Sulinore as expeditiously as possi- 
ble,” the elder whispered loudly. 

“We’re well rid of the smelly 
brutes. They have no conception of 
the dignity appropriate to legendary 
heroes.” 

Tussore, catching sight of Retief, 
broke ranks and cantered over to the 
group, puffing smoke from the cigar 
clamped in his mouth. 

“Well, we’re off,” he called heart- 
ily. “And glad to be going! The old 
place isn’t the same any more. I 
can’t even step on the grass without 
some whisk-broom handler jumping 
out and giving me a hard time. And 
that dying sun! Paugh! It gives me 
the Deep Willies!” He puffed out a 
great cloud of smoke, raised an eye- 
brow at Retief. 

“Say, why don’t you change your 
mind and join us, Retief?” he de- 
manded. “We’ll have a lot more fun 
out there chasing across the universe 
than you will staying back here with 
these stick-in-the-muds.” 

“It’s a temptation,” Retief said. 
“Maybe some day I’ll take you up 
on it. I have an idea your traiil will 
be easy to follow.” END

rrs NEW YORK IN ' 67 ! 

by LIN CARTER 

Where to go next Labor 
Day to meet the elite of sf! 



E very year the science-fiction 
world gets together in a differ- 
ent city and has itself a World Con- 
vention. And, every year, at this con- 
vention they decide which city will 
be the convention-site for next year. 

The 1966 convention was in Cleve- 
land, Ohio; there, the delegates voted 
New York to be the home of the 
1967 World Science Fiction Con- 
vention. Since I live in New York, 
this was naturally good news to me. 
But it’s also a 'historic choice, be- 
cause twenty-eight years ago, way 
back in 1939, New York was the 
site of the first science-fiction con- 
vention ever, the famous “Nycon.” 
This convention will also be call- 
ed the “Nycon” — Nycon III, be- 
cause there was a second convention 
in N.Y.C. during the 1950’s. This 
year’s convention promises to be the 
best, and biggest, and liveliest ever 



. and if you missed the Tricon 
in ’66, start planning now to visit 
Nycon III in ’67! 

When and where — and how to {oin 

The Nycon will convene over the 
Labor Day weekend at the Hotel 
Statler-Hilton here in New York. 
Labor Day in September is the tra- 
ditional convention date, because the 
long holiday weekend gives out-of- 
town visitors extra time for con- 
vention-going and sight-seeing. As 
for the Statler-Hilton, it’s one of the 
biggest and most glamorous hotels 
in a city filled with big, glamorous 
hotels, and it’s centrally located in 
Manhattan, convenient for in-coming 
tourists. 

I interviewed the two chairmen 
of the 1967 Nycon, two chaps 
named Ted White and David G. Van 



78 



Amam, both members of the big 
New York fanclub, the Fanoclasts, 
and both very active in national fan- 
dom. (Both, incidentally, are break- 
ing into the professional ranks as 
science-fiction writers. ) 

Even though you’ll have to wait 
till September to actually attend Ny- 
con III, there’s no reason why you 
can’t become a member of the con- 
vention right now. To do so, send 
your check or money order for $2.00 
to Box 637; Gracie Square Station, 
New York 10023. You’ll be a regis- 
tered member of the 1967 World 
Science Fiction Convention and will 
receive occasional Progress Reports 
which will fill you in on the pro- 
gram, the guests and the entertain- 
ments as the program gradually 
shapes up. 

fhe Progrom Book and "Nycon Comics" 

Nycon Comics goes out to all paid 
members. This is a special comic- 
book drawn by Jack Gaughan — 
you’ve seen his work in If many 
times. The first issue of Nycon 
Comics, which is neatly photo-offset 
printed, has already been distributed. 
#2, 3 and 4 have yet to appear. 

There’s literally nothing I can say 
about Jack Gaughan’s comic book, 
except that it’s one of the funniest 
things I’ve seen in years. The wild 
and woeful misadventures of a 
little band of heroic space-pioneers, 
struggling frenziedly to get the Ny- 
con going (despite evil influences 
from Floor) have to be seen and 
chuckled over to be understood. 

Every convention has a Program 
Book and sometimes a more elabo- 



rate Memory Book of the conven- 
tion as well. Nycon hopes to pro- 
duce a mammoth combination Ny- 
con Program and Memory Book, 
which will include lots of other fea- 
tures beside just the program listing. 
They hope to include special articles 
by major speakers (including the 
Guest of Honor, but I’ll get to him 
in just a moment) and lots of other 
extras. 

Two Guests of Honor? 

Every year, the convention singles 
out one particularly popular science- 
fiction writer to boost as Guest of 
Honor. Last year in Cleveland as 
you may remember, the GoH was 
none other than L. Sprague de Camp 
himself. 

Well, this year . (biggest and 
best yet, remember?) . there will 
be not one . but two Guests of 
Honor! Or is it “Guest of Honors?” 
Well, you know what I mean. Any- 
way, the Nycon will have two of 
’em, a Fan Guest of Honor and a sf 
professional GoH. 

The latter is to be Lester del 
Rey. Lester came into the field back 
in the “Golden Forties” when John 
W. Campbell was collecting and/or 
discovering a circle of brilliant wri- 
ters with which to adorn the pages 
of Astounding Science Fiction. Les- 
ter was one of a group that included 
Robert Heinlein, A. E. Van Vogt, 
Henry Kuttner, L. Sprague de Camp, 
Isaac Asimov, Clifford Simak, Mur- 
ray Leinster, L. Ron Hubbard and 
others. 

You will easily remember a num- 
ber of very fine stories with the

name of del Rey fastened to 
ikcai . “Helen O’Loy” is a much- 
aiiitliolO)gized classic; so is the taut, 
su^;>eii6eful “Nerves”; my own fa- 
vorite comes from one of the ear- 
liest issues of Galaxy — “The Wind 
Between the Worlds.” 

The Fan Guest of Honor is good 
old Bob Tuokw, a tall, cheerful guy 
with a crewcul, whose sense of hu- 
mor has made him one of the best- 
liked men in sdraice-fiotion fandom. 
For quite a few (but not enougih) 
years he publMied a fanzine called 
Le Zombie that was very big, very 
popular, very funny. (When I say 
“big,” I mean, well, like Hannes Bok 
used to draw covers for it, you know 
what I mean?) 

Since then, Bob Tucker went into 
the writing game himself, with a 
slew of hardboiled detective myster- 
ies, starting with one called The 
Chinese Doll, which set fandom back 
on its heels, because Tucker named 
some of his characters after science- 
fiction fans, from the sheriff and 
the undertaker down to the sus- 
pects . Well, quite a few novels 
followed that one, including six or 
eight science-fiction novels, like 
The Long Loud Silence and The 
Lincoln Hunters. Despite all this. 
Bob remained a fan at heart, and 
the Nycon Committee is looking for- 
ward to welcoming him to New 
York in style. 

What's on the program? 

There will be a banquet, of course, 
only for this one the Nycon has 
asked Harlan Ellison to be toast- 
master. Ellison is the only toast- 



master I know who doesn’t really 
need a microphone. There will also 
be another “Galaxy of Fashion” 
show, sponsored by Galaxy maga- 
zine. The first of these futuristic 
fa^on shows was at the Tricon in 
Cleveland; the Nycon folks thou^ 
it was good fun, so New York will 
have another. 

Most of the convention program 
is fairly traditional — an auction of 
rare books, magazines, original cover 
paintings and illustrations from the 
prozincs. And the Fan Art Show, 
which will be run by Bjo Trimble, 
who has been putting these shows 
together for the past few conven- 
tions. If you would like to enter some 
drawing or paintings of your own 
in the Fan Art Show at Nycon III, 
you’d better contact the Nycon Com- 
mittee for details. And by the way, 
a special innovation at this year’s 
convention will be included in the 
Nycon Program & Memory Book; 
a special folio of winning artwork 
from the Fan Art Shows of earlier 
conventions. 

Another innovation is scheduled. 
The Nycon will feature a running 
series of “Dialogues” scattered 
throughout the three-day convention 
program. These dialogues will be 
public conversations between two 
prominent science-fiction celebrities 
chosen for their gifts of conversation- 
al ability and the talent for thinking 
on their feet tliat makes all the dif- 
ference between dull chitchat and 
pungent, meaningful talk. Dialogue 
partners will represent opposing 
points of view on the several ques- 
tions rife in the fan and pro worlds 
right now ... the program has not

IF 




yet “firmed” to the point where I 
can list the topics to be discussed, 
but one that may go over will be 
between two well-known writers 
(whom I’ve been asked not to name). 
One represents the new slick-maga- 
zine “avant garde” type of science 
fiction, and the other stands for the 
old style “story-telling” brand of 
fiction. A battle of wits between 
them should be stimulating. 

There will be several such Dialo- 
gues on the program, as well as 
another innovation: a series of in- 
terviews in which a well known sci- 
ence-fiction writer will be inter- 
viewed in depth, to draw out his 
thoughts on the field, on his craft, 
on his peers and contemporaries, 
his writing problems, personal back- 
ground, likes and dislikes — in short, 
a regular “profile.” And there will 
be a big fan-meet-pro party at which 
free drinks will be serv^ and at 



which you are invited to meet and 
mingle with and get to know some 
of the science-fiction celebrities 
whose work you have been admiring 
for years, in relaxed informal sur- 
roundings. 

And then, of course, there will be 
the voting on and awarding of the 
coveted Hugo Awards. This is al- 
ways one of the most exciting 
events of any convention — the 
chance to vote for a book, story, 
artist or magazine you especially ad- 
mire, as “best of the year.” And 
there will be, I suppose, the cus- 
tomary costume ball. These are in- 
credibly lavish affairs, and you 
should see the inventive, imaginative, 
elaborate costumes some people 
come up with! My wife Noel and I 
are fond of costume parties, and are 
already working on ours. How about 
you?

THE 

ETHICS OF MADNESS 

by LARRY NIVEN 

Illustrated by CASTELLON 



What's the right punishment when 
a madman commits murder — if his 
lunacy is entirely his own fault? 



I 

T au Ccti is a small, cool yellow 
GO dwarf with four planets. 
Strictly speaking, none of the planets 
are habitable. Two are gas giants. 
The third inward has no air; the in- 
nermost has too much. 

That innermost world is about 
the size of Venus. With no oversized 
moon to strip away most of its air, 
it has an atmosphere like Venus’s: 
thick and hot and corrosive. No hu- 
man explorer would have marked it 
for colonization. 



But the ramrobots were not hu- 
man. 

During the twenty-first and twen- 
ty-second centuries, the ramrobots 
explored most of what later came to 
be called Known Space. They were 
complexly programmed, but their 
mission was simple. Each was to 
find a habitable planet. 

Unfortunately they were pro- 
grammed wrong. 

The designers didn’t know it, and 
the UN didn’t know it; but the ram- 
robots were programmed only to 
find a habitable point. Having lo- 



82 







cated a world the right distance 
from the star to which it was sent, 
the ramrohot probe would drop and 
circle until it found a place at ground 
level which matched its criteria for 
atmospheric composition, average 
temperature, water vapor, et cetera. 
Then the ramrobot would beam its 
laser pulse back at the solar sys- 
tem, and the UN would respond by 
sending a colony slowboat. 

Unlike the ramrobots, the man- 
carrying slowboats could not use in- 
terstellar ramscoops. They had to 
carry their own fuel. It meant that 
the slowboats took a long time to 
get where they were going, and there 
were no round trip tickets. The slow- 
boats could not turn back. 

So We Made It was colonized, 
because a ramrobot elected to settle 
in spring. Had it landed in summer 
or winter, when the planet’s axis of 
rotation points fhrough its primary, 
Procyon, it would have sensed the 
fifteen^hundred-mile-per-hour winds. 

So Jinx was colonized. Jinx, with 
a surface gravity of 1.78 and two 
habitable bands between the ocean, 
where there is too much air, and 
the Ends, where there is none at all. 
Jinx, the Easter Egg Planet, home 
of men and women who are five 
feet tall and five feet wide, the 
strongest bipeds in known space. But 
they die young, of heart trouble. 

So Plateau was colonized. For the 
innermost world of Tau Ceti is like 
Venus in size and atmosphere, save 
for one mountain. That straight-sid- 
ed mountain is forty miles tall, and 
its nearly flat top is half the size of 
California. It rises out of the searing 
black calm at the planet’s surface 



to the transparent atmosphere above; 
and that air can be breathed. Snow 
covers the peaks near the center of 
the Plateau, and rivers run lower 
down, rivers which tumble off the 
void edges of the Plateau into the 
shining mist below. The ramrobot 
landed there. And founded a 
world. 

T here was a time on that world 
when a murderer sought escape. 
Up from the Plateau on Mount 
Looldtthat came Douglas Hooker, 
rising like a star. He was the only 
occupant of a four-man exploration 
craft. Fifteen years ago he had 
stolen that ship from the UN, the 
government of Earth, and taken it 
to Plateau. He didn’t dare return it. 
The laws of Earth were far stricter 
than those of Plateau. 

And he couldn’t stay on Plateau, 
that was certain. 

Plateau would not have complain- 
ed. Hooker was a cured maniac, a 
guaranteed model citizen. An auto- 
doc had adjusted the chemistry of 
his body, canceling the biochemical 
cause of his insanity. Two years of 
psychoanalysis, hypnoanalysis and 
conditioning had attacked his memo- 
ries, altering them in some cases, re- 
ducing or enhancing their importance 
in others. Conditioning had seen to 
it that he would never remain far 
from an autodoc; his chemistry 
would never again have the chance 
to go haywire in that particular fash- 
ion. 

But he’d done a terrible thing on 
Plateau. He couldn’t stay. 

He couldn’t bear the thought of 
someday facing Greg Loeffler. 



THE ETHICS OF MADNESS

T he world below changed from a 
vast white plain to a round 
white ball. Hooker’s fusion drive 
glowed hotter and bluer than any 
sun. He was using the hydrogen in 
his tank. Though his ship carried a 
model of mankind’s first “safe” 
ramscoop, he was not yet moving 
fast enough to use interstellar hydro- 
gen for fuel. 

When Plateau was in danger of 
being lost against the stellar back- 
ground, he turned the ship toward 
Wunderland. He’d decided on Won- 
derland months ago, when he really 
began to believe that he would be 
well someday. Wunderland was 
small, of light gravity; a nice world, 
but distant from Earth. Wonder- 
land’s technology was always several 
decades behind the times. The Wun- 
derlanders would appreciate an extra 
spaceship, especially one as modem 
as Hooker’s. 

They might jail him — though 
he had served a term on Plateau, 
concurrently with his cure. But they 
wouldn’t kill him. And Hooker 
could wait out a jail sentence. His 
health was perfect. Though he was 
eighty-seven years old, he might have 
been twenty. Earth’s medical sci- 
ences had become very good indeed. 
Men and woman walked the Earth 
in places they had trod three cen- 
turies earlier; and the medicine of 
their time was long obsolete. 

(Yet . look again. Twenty? 
Never. He acts scarred. Neither years 
nor scars show in ithe flesh, nor 
ftround the eyes, nor in them. But 
bebiiid the eyes, there are scars. It 
takes decades to form scars so deep- 
ly in the crevices of the brain that 



they show through to the surface.) 

Hooker turned toward Wunder- 
land and set the autopilot. His mo- 
tions were quicker and surer than 
they had been for a long time. He 
was leaving Plateau, and he left a 
weight behind. Now he could begin 
to forget. 

T Tours later, a second star rose 
k JL from the Plateau on Mount 
Lookitthat. It turned slowly, quest- 
ing, like a hound sniffing out a 
trail. Then it fixed on Wunderland 
and began to accelerate. ^ 

II 

ctober, 2514 A. D., San Francis- 
co. 

He took the news as if he’d ex- 
pected it. He looked at the human 
doctor for a long moment after she 
had stopped talking; and then he 
slumped, back and shoulders 
dropping, chin nearly touching his 
chest. He mumbled, “I always knew 
I was different.” 

“Is that a crime, Ek)ug?” Dr. 
Doris Hahn might have been any 
age beyond thirty. She was small and 
oriental, and she had had that look 
of great wisdom long before she ac- 
quired the wisdom itself. 

“Seems it is,” said Doug Hooker. 
He was eighteen years old, thin, with 
blue eyes and straw-colored hair. “I 
can’t do an3^hing about it, can I?” 

“Sure you can! Why, you need 
never know you’ve got it, any time 
during the rest of your life. There 
are millions of potential paranoids 
walking this world and others. And 
diabetics, and epileptics, and sohizo-

IF 




phrenics. Nobody knows the differ- 
ence.” 

‘T/iey know.” 

“Well, yes.” 

Doug looked the doctor in the eye. 
“Why? If they need never know, why 
tell tfiem? How will this affect me, 
doctor? What am I supposed to do 
about it?” 

She nodded. “You’re right, of 
course. It will affect you in two 
ways. 

“First, the Fertility Board will 
probably not pass a potential para- 
noid. If you want to have a child, 
you’ll have to do something so spec- 
tacular that the Board itself must 
recognize you as a genius. Some- 
thing like inventing hyperdrive.” 

Doug smiled at that. Hyperdrive 
was “The Moon on a platter.” 

“Second,” she said. “You must 
never be out of reach of an autodoc 
for more than a month, for the rest 
of your life. Do you understand? 
Up to now your parents have had 
this responsibility. Now you’re an 
adult. You must get to a ’doc every 
month so that it can stabilize your 
metabolism. Your body is chemically 
unstable. Without antiparanoia sub- 
stances you can go insane.” 

“That’s all?” 

“That’s all. Best go every two 
weeks to give yourself some lee- 
way.” 

“I will,” said Doug. He wanted 
to leave. The news had been as bad 
as he had expected, and he’d expect- 
ed it for years. He had been born 
into a paranoid body. It was a thing 
he couldn’t tell even to Greg. He 
wanted to leave, to hide somewhere, 
to lick his wounds. But — 



“How bad is it. Doctor? I mean, 
what would happen to me if I missed 
six weeks instead of a montih?” 
“Ibe first time, very little. Your 
thinking processes would change a 
little, not enough to notice. When 
the ’doc readjusted you, you 
wouldn’t notice that change either. 
But the second and third times would 
be worse. You see, Doug, a large 
part of being insane is having been 
insane. If you were paranoid for a 
year, a ’doc couldn’t cure you. Your 
year of insanity would have formed 
habits. The ’doc would change your 
metabolism without changing your 
paranoid habits of thinking. You’d 
need a human psychotherapist.” 
Doug wet his lips. He thought the 
question: What is it like to be para- 
noid? How does a paranoid think? 
He didn’t want to know. He said, 
“ ’By, Doctor.” And he got up and 
left. He thought he heard Dr. Hahn 
call something after him, but he 
wasn’t sure. 

une, 2526, Kansas City. 

At the age of thirty, Douglas 
Hooker thought he knew himself 
pretty well. He had long known 
that he was a man of habits; and 
so he had trained his habits. Each 
weekday he entered his office at 
just ten o’clock, and the first thing 
he did was to use the desk ’doc. 

He came in that Thursday morn- 
ing at just ten o’clock, still wearing 
the smile with which he had hailed 
his good mornings at the other em- 
ployees of Skyhook Enterprises. He 
hadn’t seen Greg; but Greg was al- 
ways early or late, usually early. 
Probably at work already. Doug

sat, opened the panel in his desk, 
and inserted his hands. 

There were twin pricks in the balls 
of his middle fingers. The ’doc was 
taking a blood sample. Doug waited 
until the green light came on, then 
removed his hands. His nails gleam- 
ed. 

The desk ’doc was small; its re- 
pertoire was limited. It could not re- 
pair injuries or exercise small un- 
used muscles, as could a full sized 
drugstore ’doc. It could detect in- 
fections and fight them, with wide- 
spectrum antibiotics; it could supply 
needed vitamins; it was a fine mani- 
curist. It could stabilize Doug Hook- 
er’s unusual metabolism, using two 
phials of biochemicals stored in its 
innards. If it ran out of something, 
or if it sensed the presence of some 
medical anomaly which should be 
treated, it would flash a red light. 

Doug frowned at the papers in 
his In basket, then sighed and went 
to work. There was no sound from 
beyond his office; there was nothing 
to distract him. Yet he worked slow- 
ly. He couldn’t concentrate. It was 
not spring fever; city men didn’t 
get spring fever, living in a world 
which was mostly city. It was the 
feel of something impending. 

I t came at noon, with Greg Loef- 
fler’s voice in the intercom. 
“Doug? It’s here. Drop whatever 
you’re doing and come over.” 

Doug put down half a sandwich 
and went out, walking fast. The 
bright morning sunlight made him 
blink. He took one of the carts in 
front of Admin and drove it across 
to Design. He was about to park in 



front when his eye caught a shadowy 
bulk standing four stories tall around 
to the side. He drove over. 

Greg stood waiting for him lean- 
ing one-armed against the huge 
truncated cone, grinning like a proud 
papa. “Isn’t she gorgeous?” 

“No,” said Hooker, for it was not. 
“Will it work?” 

“We’ll sue if it doesn’t. But we 
can’t test it here. We’ll have to ship 
it to the moon.” 

“And then?” Doug felt adrenalin 
flooding his veins. All the decisions 
had been made two years ago; yet 
here was the tangible result, four 
stories tall, a decision on the verge 
of proving itself. And an ancient 
dream. 

The safe ramscoop. 

For centuries the ramrobots had 
been exploring space at just less than 
the spe^ of light, limitlessly fueled 
by hydrogen scooped from between 
stars in conical electromagnetic 
fields two hundred miles across. For 
centuries men had followed at a 
quarter of the speed of light, carrying 
their own fuel. A ramscoop’s mag- 
netic field would kill any chordate 
organism within three hundred miles. 
No shield had ever been developed 
which would protect a chordate and 
still let the ramscoop work. 

Until two years ago, when Mos- 
cow Motors had built — this. 

There was a “dead pocket,” a 
bubble in this generator’s ramscoop 
field. A ship could be built into 
that bubble, and that ship would go 
anywhere, with a limitless fuel sup- 
ply. 

Two years ago Skyhook Enter- 
prises had bought the oontraot to 



THE ETHICS OF MADNESS 



87 




build that ship. It was a UN project, 
wiith all the wealth of Earth beil^d 
it. Douig Hooker’s father was still 
president when that decision was 
made; only a year ago he had turned 
the company over to Doug and gone 
off to become a Belter. For a year 
the ramship had been Doug’s respon- 
sibility. He had given Greg Loeffler 
a free rein, not for the sake of a 
friendship fifteen years old but be- 
cause Greg was a genius at design, 
“And then we fit the ramscoop 
to the ship and take her for a trip. 
The ship’s been ready for months. 
That’s what I was doing in April and 
May, Doug. On the Moon, examin- 
ing the ship. It’s ready. All you have 
to do is get the ramscoop there.” 
Doug nodded. For a moment he 
almost envied Greg. The ship was 
Skyhook’s project, Doug Hooker’s 
project; but it was Greg’s ship. Top 
to bottom. If it was successful it 
would conquer all of nearby space. 
He said, “How’s Joanna?” 

Loeffler grinned proudly. “Out to 
here, and beautiful. Another month 
and she can go back to playing ten- 
nis. How’s Clarisse?” 

“Fine, fine.” 

“We haven’t gotten together in 
aw>hile. How about dinner tonight? 
To celebrate the ramscoop.” 

“Good. Where?” 

“Our place. You haven’t even 
seen our new house.” 

“That’s true,” Hooker said vague- 
ly. He was not at his best in a social 
situation. He was uncomfortable in 
crowds and with people he didn’t 
know. With Greg and Joanna he 
could relax; but not during work 
hours, not even with them. 



“Doug?” 

“Yah?” 

“You and Clarisse wece maixied 
long before I was. Why faaveii’t 
you had children yet? Waitmg for 
Joaima and me to pioneer the field?” 
Hooker was tempted to say. Yah, 
why not let you take the risks first? 
But then he’d be asked again. So 
he told the truth. “The Fertility 
Board turned me down.” 

“Oh?” Loeffler wasn’t about to 
ask why, but he’d left the doer 
open if Hooker wanted a sympathe- 
tic ear. 

“Guess I’d better get to work,” 
said Doug. “Will you be going to 
the moon to supervise the tests?” 

“If Skyhook pays the fare.” 

“Slip me a requisition. And we’ll 
see you tonight.”

They lay in full sunlight beside 
the pool, under Greg’s weather dome. 
All three were wet, with water run- 
ning off their bodies to form pools 
around them on the red tiles. The 
woman, Joanna, was a tall, solidly 
built brunette with lovely le^. Of 
the men, Doug Hooker was still too 
thin for his height, and not well 
muscled; whereas Greg Loeffler had 
gynmasium muscles and a loafer’s 
tan. They lay exhausted after the 
race across the pool. 

Outside it would be cold, though 
not yet freezing. In winter snow 
would surround the house and run 
melting from the weather dome. 
Greg’s house was higji in the Rook- 
ies, (halfway up a cliff. By its de- 




IF 




sign it seemed to have grown as an 
organic part of the cliff. A good part 
of it was inside the rock. 

Idly, with wistfulness but no pain, 
Doug thought Clarisse into existence 
alongside him. Golden hair in a stiff 
complex hairdo, deep all-over tan, 
she would have fallen asleep by 
now in the sunlight burning through 
the transparent weather dome. He 
hadn’t seen her in ten years. She 
had remarried right after the di- 
vorce. Two years later she had been 
twice a mother. 

Wistfulness, but no pain. She’d 
got no alimony, but she’d tried, and 
that had canceled the pain of los- 
ing her. Her ghost-image died, and 
Doug turned over on his back. 

“We’ll be leaving in a month,” 
said Joanna. There was a touch of 
regret in her voice. 

“You’re out of your minds,” said 
Doug. 

Greg got up on an elbow. “Not 
at all. The future isn’t on Earth 
any more, Doug — ” 

“Where is it, on Plateau? Any 
other world. I’d still say you were 
crazy. But teeny little Plateau? In 
five generations it’ll be as crowded 
as Earth!” 

“Then you admit Earth’s crowd- 
ed.” 

“Well, yah, but that’s the price 
you pay for civilization.” 

“I won’t pay. I’m leaving.” Greg 
was enjoying himself. He had re- 
hearsed the argument over and over 
in past months. “By the time Plateau 
gets really crowd^, there’ll be so 
many colony planets that anyone 
can take his pick. Meanwhile, Pla- 
teau is a nice place to be.” 



“Suppose they’re hoked?” 

“They aren’t.” 

“And why risk it anyway? A 
dozen light-years in a four-man 
ship! Suppose a meteor — ” 

“Suppose a goblin? For Pete’s 
sake, E)oug! I designed these ships 
myself. They’re foolproof.” 

Doug turned on his belly, scowl- 
ing. Even he didn’t know why he 
kept fighting a lost cause. Greg was 
going, and Joanna was going; their 
oldest daughter, Marcia, was going, 
with her husband. The only reason 
Greg kept up his side of the argu- 
ment was the hope that Doug would 
change his mind and come along. 
Which Doug would not. 

But the thought of Greg and 
Joanna leaving filled him with name^ 
less dread. 

“Is the ship ready yet?” 

“Yes. Since yesterday. We could 
leave any time.” 

“Not until I inspect it,” said 
Doug. “You promised.” 

“So I did. How about tomorrow? 
I’ll give you the key.” 

“Good.” 

S kyhook Enterprises had built that 
ship. By now hundreds like it 
were scattered across the sky, any- 
where within fifteen light-years of 
the solar system. Which meant that 
Earth’s information was up to fifteen 
years out of date; but as far as any- 
one knew, no Skyhook ramship had 
ever failed. Skyhook was now de- 
signing a bigger ramship, big enough 
to carry a thousand colonists in 
stasis. But the four-man Skyhook 
exploring model was the only ram- 
ship now flying. 



THE ETHICS OF MADNESS

It came in three parts, easy to 
connect or to disconnect for inspec- 
tion. Ramscoop, lifesystem, drive. 
And boosters, but boosters didn’t 
count. They didn’t count because 
they had been used for centuries. 
Rockets they were, containing helium 
compressed to within an inch of its 
life. Autopilots would guide them 
down after they had lifted Greig’s 
ship (to where he could safely use 
the fusion motor. Hooker ignored 
them, as he would have ignored a 
bicycle in the cargo hold. Too sim- 
ple, too foolproof. 

He ignored the ramscoop because 
he wouldn’t have understood it. He 
ignored the fusion drive for both 
reasons. If there were a flaw in 
either of them, he would not find 
it. 

His only chance was in the life- 
system. 

It was big and roomy, that life- 
system, even for four people. Most 
flatlanders did not have that mudh> 
room in their homes. But a claustro- 
phobic ramship passenger could not 
step outside for a breath of air. The 
lifesystem was a cylinder with the 
central core running through it, the 
central core which joined the ram- 
scoop to the fusion drive. Some- 
where in the control panel were 
emergency switches which would 
blow the core apart to release the 
lifesystem as a separate unit, to fall 
through space awaiting an unlikely 
rescue. 

There were two master bedrooms, 
soundproofed, with locks, very pri- 
vate. There "was a gymnasium with 
muscle-stretchers for use in ship’s 
gravity or in free fall, with sunlight 



tubes and masseur couches and a 
steam bath. There was a small din- 
ing room with (the kitchen controls 
set in one wall. 

Hooker walked the ship as if he 
were afraid of it. He was. He still 
wasn’t sure why. 

There was the autodoc, the most 
complex ever built. It would replace 
its own biochemicals, its own plastis- 
kin, its own artificially grown organ 
replacements; all this automatically, 
from materials culled from the ship’s 
waste collectors. It could cure any- 
thing. In theory it could keep a man 
young and healthy indefinitely. Sky- 
hook Enterprises had not built this 
beauty. Moscow Motors, that indus- 
trial giant subsidized by the sub- 
state USSR, had taken that contract 
as part of the deal that won Skyhook 
the ship contract. 

Hooker knew autodocs. He in- 
spected the coffin and the machinery 
that fed it and found no flaw. 

H e went through the kitchen, as 
much of it as he understood. 
This too turned waste into food. The 
processes were infernally compli- 
cated; but any chemical process can 
be reversed, given sufficient soph- 
istication and sufficient power. The 
ship’s power came straight from a 
fusion drive with unlimited fuel. 

The air plant was the simplest part 
of the ship. Hooker didn’t even look 
at it. By the time he got around to 
it he was bone tired. He flopped on 
one of the beds and stared at the 
softly glowing ceiling. 

As far as he could tell, there was 
nothing wrong with the ship. Noth- 
ing. What was the point in looking?

Any flaw Douglas Hooker, the exe- 
cutive, could recognize, could prob- 
ably be fixed in five minutes. 

They were going; they were prac- 
tically on their way now. Greg, and 
Joanna, and Lisa, and — he’d for- 
gotten the name of Lisa’s husband. 
But why should he try to stop them? 
He had plenty of other friends. 
Didn’t he? 

He had conjured up eleven names 
and was trying hard for a twelfth, 
when it occurred to him that all 
eleven were people he had met 
through Greg and Joanna. All but 
two, and he hadn’t seen them since 
Clarissa flew to Vegas, leaving him 
a wedding cake on which the wax 
bride and bridgegroom stood facing 
outward on opposite sides of the bot- 
tom layer. Nine people, then, whom 
he saw only at Joanna’s parties and 
“talk nights.” 

He had never made friends easily. 

Strangers made him uncomforta- 
ble. He kept wondering what they 
thought of him. 

Even friends — there was a barrier 
between him and everyone else, and 
the barrier was a secret. As far as 
he knew, two people on Earth knew 
that Hooker was a potential paranoid. 
There had been three; but his father 
had gone to the Belt to start life 
over, probably thinking that the 
more lenient Belt fertility laws would 
permit him to have a second child 
after seven years had made him a 
citizen. He had lasted two years. 
He had smoked, and his dashboard 
included an ashtray. One day, during 
the last seconds of a landing ap- 
proach to some unnamed rock, he 
had somehow used the attitude jets 



in such a way as to spill ashes out 
of the tray and into hds eyes. The 
rock had smashed hi^ sight bubble 
and his faceplate. And now there 
were two people who knew Doug’s 
secret, but both were doctors. Claris- 
sa had not known. She would have 
talked. 

His secret stopped his mouth and 
slowed his conversation and made 
it innocuous. It kept him from get- 
ting drunk, for he feared his tongue 
would loosen. No man knows his fel- 
low until he has seen him drunk; 
and no man had seen Doug Hooker 
drunk. 

He tried to face it squarely. Doug 
and Joanna were taking his social 
life with them, to Plateau. 

Why not regard it as a challenge? 

Hooker rolled off the bed and 
left the ship. He would tell the 
Loefflers that it was perfect — fool- 
proof. When they were gone he 
would make new friends, create his 
own social world. He had wrapped 
himself around his work for far too 
long. 

But he was sixty-one years old, 
and his habits were developed. 

A ugust, 2570, Kansas City. 

It happened thus : 

Every six months a man came to 
service Douglas Hooker’s desk ’doc. 
Paul Jurgenson was his name. He 
had been servicing ’docs for most 
of his life; ’docs of all kinds, from 
the huge multiple-patient emer- 
gency ’docs at aerospaceports to the 
desk-sized ’docs installed in planes 
and short-hop spacecraft, used 
by executives the world over. The 
work never bored him, for Jurgenson 



THE ETHICS OF MADNESS 



91 




WAS mot overly bright; but he was 
good ait his job. 

He came on a Thursday, the last 
day of the working week, and the 
last Thursday of August. As usual, 
Doug Hooker went home at noon, 
to give him room to work. Jurgenson 
took the ’doc apart and began to 
examine the parts. He shook his 
head sadly when he found both of 
the two special-mix vials that close 
to empty. Hooker didn’t know it, 
but Jurgenson was the third man on 
Earth who knew his secret. He had 
only guessed it, of course, but the 
guess was close enough to a cer- 
tainty. You can’t hide baldness from 
your barber. 

Jurgenson filled the vials, still 
saddened. Mr. Hooker always sent 
him a twenty-five mark bill for a 
Christmas present. (A firm handled 
Christmas presents of that nature for 
Hooker, remembering for him, but 
Jurgenson* didn’t know that.) Now 
it seemed that Mr. Hooker was using 
more antiparanoia than ever. That 
meant trouble in his life. Jurgenson 
knew that from long experience. He 
wished he could do something. 

He replaced the hypo needles as 
usual, and the vials of pure alcohol, 
and the vitamin ampK>ules and the 
testosterone. He checked various cir- 
cuits and replaced two wires; not 
that they were really ready to fail, 
but you never know. The manicure 
implefhents were self-replacing. Jur- 
genson frowned at the ’doc for a 
moment, listening to an instinct he 
trusted. It must have told him right, 
for he closed the ’doc. Then he un- 
screwed the red and green bulbs to 
look at the dates on their bases. 



They were ten years old. In those 
days men built to last. There were 
laws. But t&a years was old enough, 
even for bulbs which mighf 1^ Ibir- 
ty. Jurgenson dropped them in the 
waste shute and replaced them from 
his kit. He tripped appropriate relays 
and saw that both bulbs lit. 

He left, wavii^ to Mr. Hooker’s 
personal secretary. They had known 
each other for close to half ,a cen- 
tury and never done more than say 
hello and good-by to each other. 
Miss Peterson was a beauty. But 
Jurgenson thought his wife was too 
good for him and had long feared 
she would find out. He never philan- 
dered. 

ecember, 2570. 

Hooker entered the outer of- 
fice. “Hi, fans,” he said, as he had 
said each working day for . he 
didn’t know how long. The answer, 
from several people at once, was a 
jumbled chorus. Hooker entered his 
own office at just ten o’clock. 

The In basket was full. Hooker 
frowned at it as he shoved his hands 
into the ’doc. Was he making a mis- 
take, cutting down on Skyhook’s 
commitments? It made paperwork 
simpler, and thus saved money. But 
— sometimes Hooker felt that Sky- 
hook was stagnating. 

Other than the colony model ram- 
ships, a few of which were now in 
use for the UN, Skyhook had not 
pioneered anything in nearly twenty 
years. 

The Loefflers must be on Plateau 
by now. Had they sent him a laser 
message? If so, it would not get here 
for twelve years. 




92 



IF 




What was wrong with the ’doc? 
It should have released him by now. 

Doug withdrew his hands. There 
was no resistance; no fluids dripped 
from his fingers; his nails shone. Oh, 
nuts, he said subvocally. The green 
light’s burned out. He made a men- 
tal note to call Jurgenson. 

But he never did. It had never 
happened before; there were no hab- 
its to help him. And Jurgenson 
would be here in February. Hooker 
simply got used to the absence of a 
green light. He knew to within sec- 
onds when the ’doc was through with 
him. 

It was the red light which had 
failed. The red bulb’s filament had 
been dead for months. It had snap- 
ped and died when Jurgenson click- 
ed it off. 

IV 

bruary, 2571. 

The change came slowly. At 
first Doug noticed nothing. Then, as 
weeks passed, it seemed to him that 
his thinking was becoming clearer. 
He didn’t know why, but he was be- 
coming more intelligent. These things 
that troubled him . they had one 
linking cause. Of course Aey must. 
All he had to do was find it. 

His employees came at ten and 
went home at four, usually with 
Doug Hooker striding with them to- 
ward the parking lot, trying to look 
anonymous, returning good-bys if 
they were given. On Thursday the 
first of February Hooker did not 
leave. He nodded when his personal 
secretary told him it was after hours; 
he smiled emptily at her when she 



said good night. And then he sat. 

The world did not intrude. The of- 
fice was soundproof; its light did not 
depend on the sim; its false windows 
looked upon alien worlds, and on 
each a Skyhook ramship was land- 
ing. Impressive, for visitors. So 
Hooker could ignore the passage of 
time. 

He thought of things that had gone 
wrong with his life. 

He had no friends. 

He had no hobbies. He’d thought 
of taking one up; but it turned out 
that he hated games. Lx>sing irritated 
him, and he always lost interest be- 
fore he could become good enough 
to win. 

His life was his work and the Pal- 
ace. The Palace was a house of ill 
repute, with a reputation for being 
very good and very expensive. If 
only Hooker had had the ability to 
play . but that he had never had. 
He went to the Palace when his go- 
nads told him to, and he left when 
they quieted. Most of the girls could 
not have told you his name. 

His work was all habit. He slid 
through life as in a dream, and the 
dream was a dull one of easy defeat 
For a long time it had been that way. 
It had started . 

When Clarisse left him? His teeth 
bared in savagery. If she were the 
cause he would track her down 
wherever she hid! And the children 
for whom she had deserted him . 
No. He could remember periods of 
enjoyment, brief flashes of sunlight 
in his life, and some of them had 
happened since Clarisse. 

TTiat Christmas party at the office, 
decades ago? Someone’s idea had 




THE ETHICS OF MADNESS 



93 




sparked Uieiii all, and they had stay- 
ed until three in the morning, using 
plant facilities to build a robot. The 
body had been built of emergency 
foam plastic from the failsafe sys- 
tems in a ramship. It couldn’t have 
weighed more than twenty pounds, 
excluding another twenty pounds of 
motors, but it had stood twenty feet 
tall, blank-visaged and horrifying, 
with huge flat feet. Yes, it had been 
Greg; his idea, and mostly his sug- 
gestions. They had turned it loose on 
217th pedwalk downtown, walking 
east in the westbound lane, so that 
it stood in one place, marking time. 
Skyhook employees had waited four 
hours for the seven o’clock rush 
hour, in an automated restaurant 
above the walk. The panic had been 
a beautiful thing. 

Loeffler? 

Sure, Loeffler! He’d waited until 
Doug’s dependence on him was com- 
plete. Then he had left. So diaboli- 
cally simple. Doug had not had a 
moment of real enjoyment since. 

Hooker’s lips pulled back and 
away from his teeth. His nostrils 
flared and turned white. So simple! 
Why hadn’t he seen it before? Since 
high school it had always been Loef- 
fler, blocking every chance he’d ever 
had to make his own friends and his 
own way of life. A decades-old plot 
which had not come to fruition until 
Doug was sixty-one years old. Now, 
now that he was finally alert, Doug 
could see the bones of the plan. The 
ramship had been part of it; it made 
the business so rich and so complex 
that it took all of Doug’s time to 
handle it. A very neat trap. Had 
Claiisse been invt^ved? Perhaps. 



There was no way to tell. But — 
Greg had introduced him to Clarisse, 
hadn’t he? 

Doug settled back in his chair. 
His face became almost calm. Clar- 
isse, wherever she was, did not count. 
She had been a pawn; but Greg 
Loeffler was the king. Greg Loeffler 
must die. 

It was midnight before Doug de- 
cided what to do. His secretary was 
long gone; which puzzled him until 
he realized what time it was. But he 
could do the work himself. He knew 
how to handle a tape. He dictated 
an application to buy one ramship 
at standard prices. Purpose: to leave 
Earth. (No point in saying where he 
intended to go. Loeffler might have 
left spies anywhere. ) He put the tape 
in an envelope and dropped it in a 
mailbox on his way home. 

Greg had had his answer in three 
days. By Monday, Doug would own 
a Skyhook ship. And then . 

T Ti, fans,” Doug Hooker called 

A i as he entered the outer of- 
fice. Ranks of secretaries returned 
the greeting. They noticed nothing 
odd about him. He always walked 
that way, eyes straight ahead, walk 
fast and slightly hurried, rebuffing 
friendship before it was offered. 

He entered his office, put his 
hands in the ’doc, waited for an esti- 
mated two minutes, withdrew them. 
Have to call Jurgenson, he thought, 
and then sneered at the triviality of 
the thought. He had better things to 
do. Where was that UN envelope? 

There. He opened it, took out the 
credit-card-sized tape and inserted it 
in his desk player. 



94 



IF 




The refusal jarred him to his 
bones. He played it again, refusing 
to accept it; and again. It was true. 
He’d been turned down. 

The implications were terrifying. 
Doug had had three days to think 
things over. With every hour the na- 
ture of Loeffler’s plot had become 
clearer . and h^ involved more 
people. Loeffler must have had an 
enormous amount of help. 

But Doug had never dreamed that 
the UN was part of the plot! 

He’d have to be very careful. He 
might have given himself away al- 
ready. 

/ 

F ebruary 26th, East New York. 

Somebody had stolen a Sky- 
hook ramship. 

The call came shortly after noon, 
from a lovely, frightened woman who 
said she was the president’s personal 
secretary. “It was Mr. Hooker’s 
ship,” she explained. “He was think- 
ing of designing an improved model. 
He ordered a complete working 
mode! of the ship they’re using now. 
This morning it was gone!” 

Loughery asked, “Did the model 
have gas boosters?” He was thinking, 
Of course it had boosters. It couldn*t 
take off without them, not without 
fusing Kansas City. But maybe a 
truck hauled it away? 

“Yes, it had boosters.” 

“Why?” 

“Mr. Hooker wanted it complete 
in every detail.” 

“Oh, Lord.” Loughery rubbed the 
back of his head. The idiot! Wanted 
a complete model, did he? Now 
there was a fusion ship loose some- 
where in the solar system. Cut a few 



safety relays, turn off the fusion 
shield, and any fusion ship becomes 
an exploding fusion bomb. “We’ll 
send someone over right away. Is 
Mr. Hooker there?” 

“He didn’t arrive this morning.” 

“Well, give me his home address. 
And if he shows up, have him call 
here immediately.” 

The pieces began to fall together. 

First, Skyhook. The area was well 
guarded; it would have been difficult 
for anyone to get in without being 
spotted. There was no human guard, 
but any unauthorized entry would 
have been photographed a dozen 
times. There would have been alarms. 

Second, the Belt called. Several 
million people owned most of the 
solar system and a political power 
equal to that of the UN. They were 
furious. A fusion ship had left Earth 
without proper notification and was 
now' boring through space toward 
the system’s edge, paying no atten- 
tion to laser calls. Loughery prom- 
ised payment of damages. It was all 
he could do. 

Nobody found Hooker. If he was 
at home, he wasn’t answering phone 
calls. 

The gas boosters found their way 
home. Loughery’s men took charge 
of them immediately, inspecting them 
for clues. Re-entry had not burned 
the fingerprints off their shiny sur- 
faces. The fingerprints were Hook- 
er’s, some of them. 

Loughery filed a request for a war- 
rant to search Hooker’s house. It 
began to look as if Hooker had stol- 
en his own ship. 

On the afternoon of the twenty- 
seventh, somebody found Hooker’s 



THE ETHICS OF MADNESS 



95 




request to buy a ramship. It had been 
turned down for several good rea- 
sons. For one, Hooker had named 
nedither destination nor purpose. For 
another, the UN was careful about 
passing fusion drives out to anyone 
who might ask; whereas Hooker — 
Loughcry felt the hair stir on the 
back of his neck. 

Hooker was a potential paranoid. 

urgenson called that evening. 

By then Loughery was in Kan- 
sas City. He went right over to in- 
terview Jurgcnson personally. 

“He was using too much of this 
guck,” said Jurgcnson. He indicated 
two phials, both bone dry. “That’s 
bad. I got other people who use stuff 
like this, people who need special 
guck or something goes wrong in 
their heads. When they got troubles, 
they use more guck than usual.” 
“But there’s a warning light.” 
Jurgenson wrung his hands. “It’s 
my fault. I put in a bad light It 
worked when I tried it. I can’t un- 
derstand why it went had.” 

“Who was Hooker’s doctor?” 
“Human? I don’t know. Miss 
Peterson might.” 

Lx>ughery asked Miss Peterson. 

By then the search warrant had 
come through. What privacy there 
was on a crowded Earth was highly 
regarded; search warrants were not 
passed around like advertising post- 
ers. Hooker’s home turned out to 
be the top of a skyscraper in down- 
town Kansas City. 

Hooker had left a note, a long 
one. It said that, since Hooker had 
no friends and no particular purpose 
in life, he had decided to spend the 



rest of his life in a project all his 
own. He was going to try to reach 
the edge of the universe. He did not 
expect to succeed. The ramship 
would keep him alive indefinitely, 
but indefinitely was not forever. Yet 
he intended to try. 

It was a sanely spoken tape. Syn- 
tax was in order; Hooker’s voice 
seemed calm. Hooker’s expressed 
purpose was the only crazy thing 
about it. But Hooker was guaranteed 
crazy, wasn’t he? 

Loughery called the Bdt again. 
Hooker’s ship was well out of the 
inner system, far enough so that the 
Belt could stop monitoring him; 
there was little chance of his deadly 
drive flame crossing anyone’s path 
before it dissipated. Yes, he was 
headed roughly toward the galactic 
rim. 

It checked, thought Loughery. 
Hooker would have been better ad- 
vised to head straight out along the 
galactic axis; there was less junk 
to get in his way. But perhaps he 
hadn’t thought of that. 

The excitement began to settle. 
Loughery had other problems. But 
there was one last thing he could 
do about the Hooker problem, and 
eventually he thought of it. 

“Keep a monitor on Hooker,” he 
told the Belt Political Section. “We’ll 
pay the standard fee. We want to 
know if he turns back, or if he 
changes course toward some in- 
habited world.” 

And that would do it, he thought. 
Eventually Hooker would use the 
ship’s ’doc. That simple. It would 
cure him. Then he would either turn 
back to Earth, to face a charge of 



96 



IF 




stealing a fusion motor, or he would 
move on to one of the colonies. Prob- 
ably the latter; stealing a fusion plant 
was a capital crime on Earth. But 
they could deal with him, offer him 
amnesty for the prompt return of 
the ship. 

Three weeks later the word came. 
The actinic spark that was Hooker’s 
drive had definitely shifted toward 
Tau Ceti. 

Loughery had to admit that Pla- 
teau was a good choice. 

Plateau had suffered badly from 
the organ bank problem, in the two 
centuries before alloplasty, the sci- 
ence of putting foreign materials in 
the human body, had overtaken the 
techniques of organic transplant. All 
the inhabited worlds had gone 
through that stage. Its worst feature 
was that there was only one way to 
get the most important organic trans- 
plants. 

On Plateau a small ruling class 
had held the power of life and death 
over its citizens. Life, because with 
unlimited access to the organ banks 
one could live centuries. Death, be- 
cause any crime could be made a 
capital crime whenever the organ 
banks ran short. The citizens would 
not complain. They wanted to live 
centuries. 

Then alloplasty had caught up. 
Now there were no organ banks at 
all on Plateau, and no capital punish- 
ment. 

Loughery sent a laser to Plateau, 
warning them that a stolen ship was 
due to land there. He wasn’t sure 
which would get there first, the laser 
or the ship. After all, Ramships 
were fast. 



V 

M arch, 2571 A. D., ship’s time. 

The ship flew itself, of course. 
All Doug had to do was take it be- 
low the plane of the Belt, leave it 
alone for a couple of weeks, then 
aim for Tau Ceti. The two weeks 
were misdirection. With the note he 
had left, they might convince the 
police that he was going off to no- 
where and would never bother them 
again. 

He kept busy, watching for gold- 
skin ships — Belt police; reading 
instruction booklets over and over, 
getting familiar with his machines; 
and it wasn’t until he had passed 
Pluto’s orbit that he began to relax. 

Nobody was after him, as far as 
he could tell. Not that they could 
have done anything; you can’t stop 
a ship in space. You can only des- 
troy it. But he was reassured. He 
had broken free of his long bondage. 
And now . the long wait. Tau 
Ceti was eleven point nine light- 
years away. It would take less sub- 
jective time than that, with the 
velocities he would eventually reach; 
but still .... 

He frowned. He hadn’t been in a 
’doc in some time. It would be stupid 
to get sick and die just when venge- 
ance was within his grasp. 

He climbed into the ’doc tank and 
went to sleep. 

The ’doc found it necessary to 
make drastic changes in his meta- 
bolism. Hooker felt very strange 
when he woke. The strangeness 
seemed to be in his thinking, and 
that made it horrible. He felt slow, 
stupid. He could no longer rememba-

why he wanted to kill Greg. He re- 
membered only that his lifelong 
friend had done him a great wrong. 

He thought of turning back. But 
he couldn’t do that; he’d end in the 
organ banks for stealing this ship. 

Should he try another colony 
world? It was a confusing question. 
His mind was full of confusing ques- 
tions. But it was obvious that Mount 
Lookitthat was his best bet, regard- 
less of what happened when he got 
there. Plateau was the only world 
of Man which did not impose the 
death penalty. If they decided he’d 
committed a crime, he’d get medical 
treatment. 

His head buzzed. Perhaps he 
needed medical treatment? But the 
ship’s ’doc could do anything. 

He went on. 

And as the weeks passed, a strange 
thing happened. He remembered his 
grudge against Greg Loeffler. And 
he realized something that sent cold 
chills of rage through him. They’d 
booby-trapped the ’doc I 

No, it was worse than that. Some- 
how, long ago, Greg Loeffler and his 
minions had managed to booby-trap 
every ’doc on Earth. For all of his 
life. Hooker had been using the 
’docs. And each time he did, the 
’docs had made alterations in his 
mind and body to keep him docile. 

What could he do? His very life 
depended on the ’doc! 

It took him a few days to get 
over his sense of panic; or perhaps 
he merely got used to it. Then he 
went to work. There was a thick 
instruction booklet for repairing the 
’doc. Hooker memorized it. When 
he felt he was ready, he began to 



disconnect things. It was difficult 
to decide what to cut out. Finally 
he tackled it from the other direc- 
tion. What to leave running? An- 
esthetics, of course, and the luxuries: 
manicures, haircuts, massage. Vita- 
mins, antibiotics, all diagnostic ma- 
chinery, surgical repair . except 
in the region of the head. He didn’t 
dare leave that! Anticholesterol, 
synthetic blood components, allo- 
plasty components and insertion 
tools .... 

He finished in two months. The 
’doc should be incapable of any- 
thing that could damage his mind. 
But still he was afraid of it. 

He tried it anyway. He was in- 
sane, definitely; but not stupid. 

When h^ woke up he knew that 
the ’doc was safe. 

ear 2583.8 A.D., Plateau. 
Plateau was a silver ball hang- 
ing serene in the heavens. Hooker 
stopped nearby, not too near, and 
not in any particular orbit. He be- 
gan to scan the surface. 

Where was Mount Lookitthat? 

He couldn’t find it. He turned 
ship to circle the planet ... an ir- 
ritating delay for an impatient man. 
Then he thought of turning on his 
radio. He’d turned it off because 
Plateau’s voices of authority kept 
trying to tell him what to do. Now 
he could use their directional signal. 

“ — Calling Douglas Hooker. 
Douglas Hooker, will you please 
answer? Do you need help? The 
United Nations claims you are fly- 
ing a stolen ship. Is this true? You 
will need re-entry craft to land. Are 
you able to establish an orbit so that

they can find you? Douglas Hook — ” 

Hooker frowned down at the sil- 
ver field in his ’scope screen. That 
was where Mount Lookitthat ought 
to be, according to his directional 
finder. So where was it? 

Overcast, of course. By water va- 
por. There must be fog there, or 
rain. 

Hooker smiled and moved in. 

He dropped fast into the mist be- 
yond the void edge. If there were 
finders on him he was caught; but 
what could they do about him? They 
couldn’t approach him with anything 
manned. His ramscoop field was as 
deadly as earlier models, save for 
that “dead pocket.” All he had to 
do was turn it on. 

He heard nothing on the radio. 
They weren’t sending in his direc- 
tion. Good. 

And he was somewhere off the 
void edge of Mount Lookitthat. 

He’d passed through Loeffler’s 
laser message just about a year ago, 
ship’s time. It was mealymouthed 
friendliness, all of it, obviously de- 
signed to lull Hooker’s suspicions. 
All the same, it was a bad mistake 
on Loeffler’s part. It included pic- 
tures of his house and environs. 

^ Loeffler’s house resembled his old 
home on Earth. It was large, al- 
most ostentatiously large, and it 
seemed designed to fit its surround- 
ings, as if it had grown from the 
land. Loeffler no longer lived on a 
cliff. He bad chosen a spot in hilly 
country, set a few hundred feet back 
from the void edge in one direction 
and from a river in another. The 
river had etched itself a canyon 
which led to the void edge. 



Hooker kept his ship submerged 
in the mist. His drive must be giving 
off a hellish glow, but he hoped he 
was far enough down for the mist 
to hide it. He angled his ship toward 
the invisible Mount Lookitthat and 
moved slowly in that direction. 

Look for a waterfall. 

It might not show at this level. 
It might turn to spray and evaporate 
high above. 

Something black and formless 
loomed in the lesser blackness. 
Simultaneously, Hooker’s radar beep- 
ed. Something black and huge, in- 
definitely huge .... Hooker backed 
ship and raised the thrust. The ship 
shot up. Up and up, and the mist 
began to thin . and Hooker had 
his first look at the side of Mount 
Lookitthat. It seemed infinite. It 
went on and on, up and down and 
sideways, like the surface of a world 
tilted from horizontal to vertical. 

(After four hours of hopeless 
searching, the pilot of Plateau’s first 
colony slowboat had seen Mount 
Lookitthat rising suddenly out of an 
endless white furry plain. “Lookit- 
that!” he’d said, in the voice of one 
punched in the stomach, four hun- 
dred years ago.) 

Hooker took his ship straight up 
the fluted side. Mist boiled and 
churned below him. Now he got his 
first look at Plateau’s big, soft sun. 
Tau Ceti was smaller and cooler 
than Sol, so that Plateau had to 
huddle closer for warmth, making 
the star look bigger from Plateau’s 
surface. But Hooker had been travel- 
ing for more than four years of ship’s 
time. He’d all but forgotten what a 
sun looked like. 



100 



IF 




Above and to the left, a fwaterfall. 
He angled that way. 

The ship shot past tihe void edge. 
Suddenly most of Plateau was be- 
low him. Doug cut his thrust and 
looked around. 

He snarled. He’d picked the wrong 
waterfall. 

There were no spacecraft; but he 
could see cars all across the land, 
all colors, most of them staying near 
the ground. There were houses, and 
all were large. Loeffler’s house must 
be about average in size. Sure, 
Hooker rebuked himself. They*ve 
got more room. Did he plan that 
too? Hiding from me .... 

Could that be it? 

Hooker dropped. It was a great 
rounded house, like an enormous 
boulder with picture windows built 
into it. There was a river . and 
it was close to the void edge .... 

That was it. 

But was Loeffler there? 

It didn’t matter. Hooker back- 
angled his ship and came to a stop 
over the house. His drive licked 
down. 

The house erupted in flame. 

Hooker laughed. He shouted, 
“You won’t use that as a hiding 
place! Are you dead, Greg? If you’re 
not, I’ll find you wherever you 
hide!” Still laughing, he increased 
thrust and rose into the sky. Below 
him was a boiling lava pit. 

He needed a city. A city would 
have records. He could search them 
to find where Loeffler was now. 

But he’d have to be careful. Loef- 
fler had taken over Earth. Hooker 
didn’t know how long it had taken 
him. But he’d been on Plateau more 



than twelve years; he must have 
made some progress here. 

Hooker’s radio sounded. 

It was a sound Hooker had never 
heard before. It was very loud, and 
very terrible. Hooker reached to 
turn off the radio. His arms stopped 
halfway. He couldn’t move thenu 
He settled back in his seat. A strange, 
peaceful expression spread across his 
face. Presently a voice began to give 
orders, and Hooker obeyed. 

44 T ucky he had his radio on.” 
-L' The second man nodded. “He 
could have wiped out this whole 
world. Land him, will you? I’ll call 
the hospital.” 

“Whose house was that?” 

“I don’t know. Let’s hope nobody 
was in it. Will you please get him 
down? If it wears off he’ll turn off 
the radio, and then where will we 
be?” 

Y ear 2584.4 A. D., Hospital, 
Plateau. 

They quit work at five o’clock. 
Hooker, was exhausted. The chain 
gang had been planting trees where 
a generation of special mold had 
made sufficient soil to support then!. 
Machines did some of the work; but 
mainly the chain gang used their 
hands. 

Planting trees gave Hooker a feel- 
ing of accomplishment. Even as 
president of Skyhook he had never 
felt so useful. 

He was bone tired until dinner 
arrived, and then he was ravenous. 
By the time he finished dinner he 
was no longer tired. He went to 
his room and read until eight o’clock.

^ychotherapy was to be at eight. 

“I’ve been thinking,” he told 
Ike doctor. “I want to know if I 
Aslled anyone.” 

“Why?” 

Wor^ formed a bottleneck in 
Hooker’s throat. It had stopped him 
before. He never knew how to 
answer that particular question. 
This time he forced some kind of 
an answer out. 

“I want to know how guilty I 
am!” 

“You know what you were trying 
to do. Whatever you did is done. 
How will feeling guilty help any- 
thing?” 

“I don’t know. But if I’m not sup- 
posed to feel guilty, why am I in 
prison? And don’t tell me it’s a hos- 
pital. I know it’s a hospital. It’s also 
a prison.” 

“Of course it is.” 

He’d killed four people. He’d 
tilled Joanna Loeffler, and her 
daughter and son-in-law and grand- 
son. Greg Loeffler had been else- 
where. They waited a year to tell 
Hooker. 

VI 

Y ear 2585.7 A. D., between 
stars. 

“Doug!” 

Hooker jumped. 

The radio yelled, “Doug, this is 
Greg. Answer me!” 

Hooker hesitated only a moment. 
This was what he had dreaded. 
Loeffler must have a com laser on 
him, with a directional signal in it. 
Hooker told the autopilot to follow 
k back. 



The radio didn’t wait. “Answer 
me, damn you! You know what I 
want!” 

What was with Greg? How could 
he possibly expect Hooker to answer 
immediately? It would take hours 
for Hooker’s com laser to cross the 
gap to Plateau. Hooker shifted ner- 
vously. The autopilot beeped, and 
he said, “I’m here, Greg. I didn’t 
want to talk to you. I left Plateau 
because I couldn’t face you. You 
mxist know how sorry I am for what 
happened.” 

Greg’s voice didn’t wait. “Doug! 
Why don’t you answer? Is it be- 
cause you think I’m going to kill 
you?” 

Hooker came bolt upright in his 
chair. OhI 

Suddenly it was appallingly clear. 
Loeffler, shouting into a com laser, 
forgetting the lightspeed gap, was 
not a sane Loeffler. 

Tau Ceti was a white flare in the 
stern scope. Wonderland’s sun was 
too dim to see from here. Hooker 
turned on his ramscoop field: a 
complex process, most of which 
would be handled by the auto-pilot. 
Then he got up and began to pace. 

“You cowardly, murdering — 
Loeffler’s speech turned profane. His 
accusations, justified at first, became 
wildly imaginative. Hooker listened, 
trying to gauge the depth of Greg’s 
insanity. It was one more item on 
his burden of guilt. 

Why didn’t somebody stop him? 
A com laser was too powerful not 
to leak. Plateau radios must be pick- 
ing this up. 

And where had he gotten a com 
laser? The Plateau station was closed 



102 



IF 




to all but qualified personnel. But 
Greg owned a ship with a com 
laser .... 

A ship just like this one. 

Almost calmly, Hooker sat down 
at the control board. He connected 
the autopilot screen to the stern 
scope. Tau Ceti glowed brightly off 
center. Hooker centered it, then be- 
gan to enlarge it. The screen turned 
yellowish-white, with a blue point 
moving off-screen near the top. 
Hooker centered that, enlarged it. 

A deep blue flare with a black 
dot in the center. 

Loeffler was coming after him. 

L oeffler’s hoarse voice stopped 
suddenly. Then it giggled. 
“Tricked you,” it said, suddenly 
calm. 

The stem scope turned deep red. 
Damn, thought Hooker. He did 
trick me. The scope screen would 
not transmit more light than human 
eyes could bear; but there was a 
dial to register the light falling on 
the scope. That dial registered maxi- 
mum. Loeffler was using his com 
laser as a weapK>n. At maximum 
power it could easily have blanketed 
Earth’s solar system with a clearly 
read signal. But Loeffler was firing 
it at an object only light-hours dis- 
tant. 

He could kill me, Hooker thought. 
He could do it. 

It would’t be fast. Loeffler was 
firing from behind, at that part of 
Hooker’s ship which was built to 
stand fusion flame applied for years. 
But eventually things would melt. 

Greg was jubilant. “I’m going to 
burn you, Doug! Just like you burn- 



ed Joanna and Lisa and Tom and 
little Greg! But slower! Slower, 
you — ” And there was more pro- 
fanity. 

Needles were rising. Hull tempera- 
ture indicators, power consumption 
meters, climbed toward pink zones 
nobody had ever expected them to 
touch. 

Doug Hooker rubbed his eyes. He 
waited for an inspiration, and none 
came. Needles touched their pink 
zones. Bells rang, and Doug turned 
them off. After a bit he left the con- 
trol room and went downstairs and 
lay down in the masseur couch. 

He*s going to kill me. The 
thought seemed far away, drowned 
in the groaning comfort of the mas- 
sage. 

All I wanted was a new life. I 
wanted to go away and start over. 
The couch was a hard, enveloping 
caress. 

He won't let me. He wants to 
kill me. And who has a better right? 

Let him kill me. 

No. 

It was difficult to struggle out 
of the couch, for the couch was not 
finished with him. During a mas- 
sage one must be in a defeatist frame 
of mind. Otherwise one tenses; one’s 
automatic defenses take over. But 
somehow Doug pulled himself free 
of the gentle, grasping embrace, and 
somehow he got upstairs to the con- 
trol room. He was still covered with 
massage oil. 

A man attacked has the right to 
defend himself. 1 paid for my crime. 

Doug sat down in the control 
chair, used a key to unlock a panel. 
There were override switches under- 



THE ETHICS OF AfUDNESS 



103 




neath. One turned off the ship’s 
alarm bells; one allowed excess 
power in the ship’s circuitry; three 
others set up the sequence that would 
blow the ship apart if the drive or 
the ramscoop failed. Everything un- 
der the panel was an override switch 
for the ship’s automatic safety pre- 
cautions. Doug flipped one switch 
and closed the panel. Then he twist- 
ed a dial hard over, as far as it 
would go. 

His com laser was already fixed 
on Loeffler’s ship. Now it would 
bum. 

Hooker turned off his fusion drive 
to reduce the heat pouring in at the 
ship’s stern. Now he had a good 
chance. He was firing his laser at 
Loeffler’s nose, where there was 
less protection. The massive, almost 
invulnerable bulk of the ramscoop 
would absorb most of the beam; 
but the lifesystem was wider than 
the ramscoop, and it would catch a 
lot of light. Eventually its walls 
would melt. 

Hooker would kill Loeffler before 
Loeffler could kill Hooker. 

Doug went back to the masseur 
couch. He felt very tired. 

T he lifesystem became hot. Un- 
bearably hot. When Doug felt 
he could stand it no longer he went 
upstairs to throw another override 
switch. When he had done that the 
cooling equipment would get more 
power, and his lifesystem would be 
cool until relays or busbars burned 
out. 

At the control panel he found 
that it wasn’t necessary. The ruby 
glow was gone from the rear scope 



screen. Loeffler’s laser had burned 
out or lost its target. 

Loeffler’s ship was still there, still 
following. Hooker started his drive 
and turned off his laser. He was on 
his way to Wunderland, with 
Loeffler following. 

ear 2587.2, between stars. 
Turnover. Loeffler was still be- 
hind him. Hooker had long been 
convinced that Loeffler’s com laser 
was burned out. He had used his 
own com laser, but Loeffler never 
answered. 

And now he used it again. 

“Greg,” he said. “You’ve been 
following me for three and a half 
years. I assume that you want justice 
on Wunderland. You’re entitled to 
state your case there. But now it’s 
turnover time, in case you hadn’t 
noticed, and I’m turning around. 
Please do the same.” 

And he used the gyros to swing 
the ship. 

He was as nearly sane as a ’doc 
could make him. In three and a 
half years he had almost forgotten 
about Loeffler, or at least to accept 
him as an endurable evil. And there 
was this: Loeffler had a ’doc. He 
must have used it. A ’doc would not 
keep a man sane under undue stress, 
but Hooker could at least hope that 
Loeffler would use the law instead 
of weapons. The law might punish 
Hooker, despite double jeopardy 
laws, but it would also protect him. 

He fell tail first toward Wunder- 
land. 

Now a point of light showed in 
the front scope. Hooker watched 
for it to turn. It was small, that 




104 



IF 




dot of light; for Loeffler had fallen 
far behind in the race toward Wun- 
derland. Hooker’s ramscoop was 
taking part of Loeffler’s fuel, since 
Loeffler was in his shadow. 

Hours after turnover, the point 
of light moved. Loeffler had gotten 
his message ... or seen hinri turn. 
The point of light became a line of 
light, then swung back to a point. 

It still had a dot in the center. 

“No,” said Hooker. 

A black dot in the center of a 
blob which showed mostly blue. 

“No. You’re going the wrong way. 
Turn around, you idiot!” 

The ships were diving nose-on at 
each other. 

Hurriedly Hooker swung his ship 
around. / should have known, he told 
himself. Loeffler wants to ram. 
When I accelerate to the side, so 
does he, because otherwise I might 
get around him. But he won't let 
me slow down. 

If I get within three hundred miles 
of his ramscoop .... 

It was a stalemate. Loeffler 
couldn’t catch Hooker, and Hooker 
couldn’t escape Loeffler. But only 
Loeffler had the power to give up 
the game. 

ear 2590.0 A. D., Plateau. 
Loughery came to Plateau in a 
colonist ramship. It was a common 
practice in those days for Earth to 
finance one-way trips to the colony 
worlds, simply to get them off the 
planet. On the sixtieth birthday 
Loughery, having had enough of be- 
ing a UN official, took the UN up 
on its offer. 

He could have chosen any of the 



colony worlds. He chose Plateau be- 
cause the social structure fascinated 
him. When he had learned enough 
he intended to become a lawyer. 

“That won’t be easy,” the moun- 
taineer cop told him. Loughery had 
braced the guy as he was coming 
off duty and offered to buy him 
drinks and dinner in return for in- 
formation. “The mountaineer laws 
aren’t as difficult as Earth’s, at least 
from what I hear, but you may have 
trouble understanding the ethics be- 
hind them.” 

“I gather a mountaineer is a Pla- 
teau dweller.” 

“Right. Like a crashlander comes 
from We Made It and a flatlander 
comes from Earth.” 

“About the ethics.” 

“Hmmm.” The cop scratched the 
back of his head. “Tell you what. 
The records building is still open. 
Let’s walk over, and I’ll find you a 
few examples.” 

He had to use three electronic 
keys to get to the files. Once inside, 
he looked around him, lips puckered 
judiciously. “I’ll start you with an 
easy one,” he said. And he pulled 
a tape out of a drawer filled with 
similar tapes. “Let’s run this.” 

They played it. 

“Hooker,” said Loughery. “I re- 
member him. Dammit, I’m the one 
who sent out the warning. I thought 
the ’doc had cured him. I’m as guilty 
as he is.” 

The cop looked very coldly at 
Loughery. “Could you have stopped 
him?” 

“No. But I could have stressed the 
warning.” 

“As long as there was a warning. 




THE ETHICS OF AAADNESS

Now, do you understand the logic 
behind Hooker’s sentence?” 

“Fm afraid not. He got -two years 
imprisonment for negligent homicide, 
with simultaneous psychotherapy and 
conditioning. Psychotherapy is a lost 
art on Earth, by the way. I don’t 
question why he only got two years, 
but why negligent homicide?” 

“There’s the crux. He wasn’t guil- 
ty of murder, was he?” 

“Fd say yes.” 

“But we say he was insane. That’s 
a legitimate plea.” 

“Then why was he punished?” 
“For letting himself become in- 
sane. He knew he was a potential 
paranoid; all he had to do was stay 
in reach of a working autodoc. And 
he didn’t. Four people died. Negli- 
gent homicide.” 

Loughery nodded. His head was 
spinning. 

“What isn’t here on the tape is the 
follow-up. Loeffler tried to kill 
Hooker.” 

“Oh?” 

“Hooker left in a ramship. Lx>ef- 
fler went after him. They had a big 
duel with com lasers. Now, let’s sup- 
pose Hooker had won that battle 
and killed Lx>effler. What then?” 
“Self-defense.” 

“Not at all. Murder.” 

“But why?” 

“Lx>effler was insane. And he was 
insane as a direct result of Hooker’s 
crime, not through Loeffler’s own 
negligence. Hooker could run or hide 
or yell for help or talk Loeffler into 
accepting treatment. He could not 
strike back. If he’d killed Loeffler 
he’d have gotten fifty years for mur- 
der.” 



“Maybe I should be a farmer. 
What did happen?” 

“I wouldn’t know. Neither of them 
ever came back to Plateau.” 

VII 

Y ear 120,000 A. D. approx. 
Fifty years? 

The flap of a gnat’s wing. 

The long chase was nearing its 
end. At first Hooker had gained on 
his pursuer, for Loeffler’s ramscoop 
was not getting as much hydrogen as 
Hooker’s. Loeffler’s ship was in the 
shadow of Hooker’s. At one time 
they had been light-years apart. But 
now Loeffler’s ship was gaining. For 
Hooker’s ship had reached terminal 
velocity. 

There had to be a limit on the 
velocity of a fusion powered ram- 
ship. It was this: when the exhaust 
velocity of the fusion drive was no 
greater than the velocity of the in- 
terstellar hydrogen hitting the ram- 
scoop, the ship could go no faster. 
Hooker had reached that limit tens 
of thousands of years ago. And so 
had his pursuer. 

But Loeffler’s ship was using hy- 
drogen which had slipped through 
Hooker’s ramscoop. The hydrogen 
wasn’t hitting Loeffler’s ramscoop 
field as hard. It had absorbed 
velocity from Hooker’s. 

Loeffler was close behind. 

The chase could end within de- 
cades. 

O nce upon a time Hooker had 
hopped Loeffler would give up 
and turn around. Surely he would 
realize that Hooker could not be

caught! But the years (had stretched 
to decades, and every year Loeffler 
waited meant four years trying to 
get back to Wunderland. He’d have 
had to decelerate before he could 
begin the long flight home, and 
deceleration would take as many 
decades as he had spent fleeing. And 
so Hooker had spent two hours a 
day before the scope screen, watch- 
ing the stars crawl past year by year, 
waiting for Lx>effler to turn around. 

The years had stretched into cen- 
turies, and still Hooker spent two 
hours a day watching the rear scope 
screen. Until there were no more 
stars ahead, but only the distant 
muddled dots of galaxies, and the 
stars behind were taking on a vague- 
ness like curdled milk. And when 
the centuries had become millenia, 
Hooker no longer believed his ene- 
my would let him go. But still he 
spent two hours per ship’s day before 
the scope screen, watching the galaxy 
drop away. 

He was totally a man of habits 
now. He had not had an original 
thought in centuries. The ship’s clock 
governed his life in every detail, 
taking him to the autodoc or the 
kitchen or the gym or the steam 
room or the bedroom or the bath- 
room. You’d have thought he was an 
ancient robot following a circular 
tape, no longer able to respond to 
outside stimuli. 

He looked more like an aged 
robot than an aged man. From a 
distance he would have looked 
twenty. The ’doc had taken good 
care of him. But there were things 
the ’doc could not do. The oldest 
living man had been short of four 



hundred years old when that ma- 
chine was made. Moscow Motors 
had had no way of knowing what a 
man would need when his life could 
be measured in tens of thousands of 
years. And so the face was young; 
but the veneer was cracked, and the 
muscles no longer showed any kind 
of expression, and the habit patterns 
of the man were deeply grooved in- 
to the DNA memory processes of the 
brain. 

By now the chase meant nothing 
to Hooker. In any case he would 
have been incapable of original 
thought. 

T hey had come up along the 
galactic axis. Hooker, looking 
into the scope screen, saw the galaxy 
face on. It was not bright, but it was 
wide. The galaxy showed like vari- 
colored dyes poured into viscous 
ink, red dye and yellow and blue 
and green, but mostly red, and then 
the whole mass swirled around the 
center of the pot. So that the center 
glowed all colors, a continuous mass 
of stars packed so closely as to blot 
the blackness behind; but it was not 
bright. There is dust even in inter- 
galactic space. Nearly one hundred 
thousand light-years of dust shaded 
the galaxy from Hooker’s view. The 
arms were almost black, the glowing 
areas spotted with black gaps and 
dust clouds. Everything was redden- 
ed and dimmed by Doppler shift. 
He could not see Loeffler. 

Habit used his fingers to magnify 
the view, slowly. The galaxy, already 
wide enough to fill the scope screen, 
expanded. In the core, individual 
red giant stars appeared, bigger than 



THE ETHICS OF A^ADNESS 



107 




anytMng in the arms. And a blue- 
white spot appeared, and grew. 

It grew until it filled the screen. 
There was a black dot in the center. 

Hooker had watched for nearly 
an hour before the thought stirred in 
his brain. That hadn’t happened for 
a long time, but it did happen. Hook- 
er’s memory capacity was nearly 
full. But his brain was in good work- 
ing order; he was guaranteed sane. 

/ wonder what damage I did? 

The thought threatened to slip 
away, but he grabbed for it, sensing 
somehow that it might be impor- 
tant. / held my com laser on him 
for hours. I may have damaged him. 
Vve never seen him broadside; Vd 
have no way of knowing. But if his 
ship is badly hurt, I could finish the 
job with my laser. Mine never burn- 
ed out. His did. 

He’d have to wait until Loeffler 
got closer. The thought slipped 
away . 

. And return^ two days later. 
I wonder how much damage I 
did? How would I find out? 

Every day he remembered the 
problem. A month and a half after 
he had first thought of it, he thought 
of the answer. 

H e could turn the ship sideways 
to fire the fusion drive later- 
ally. Loeffler would imitate him to 
keep him from sneaking past and 
home. That would put Loeffler 
broadside to him. 

He had done it once before, trying 
to make turnover for Wonderland. 
But Loeffler had been too far away 
for the scope to show details. If he 
did it now .... He did. 



Then he focused one of the side 
scopes on Loeffler, enlarged the 
image and waited. 

The time came when he should 
have gone to the steam room. He 
was half out of his seat; but he 
couldn’t leave. Loeffler hadn’t turn- 
ed yet. The ships were light-hours 
apart. Hooker forced himself to sit 
down and to stay down, gripping 
the arms of the control chair with 
both hands. His teeth began to chat- 
ter. He shivered. A deadening cold 
spread through him. He sneezed. 

The shivering and the sneezing 
continued for a long time, then pass- 
ed. Steam room time was over. 

Loeffler began to turn. 

And Hooker knew why he had 
never turned for home. 

There was no lifesystem at all. 
The hfesystem had always been the 
most fragile part of the ship. Eons 
ago Hooker’s laser had played over 
Loeffler’s lifesystem and melted it 
to slag. Nothing was left but tattered 
shards, polished at the edges by gas 
molecules slipping through the ram- 
scoop shield. 

Loeffler hadn’t died fast. He’d had 
time to program the autopilot to ar- 
range a collision course with Hook- 
er’s ship. 

Loeffler might have given up the 
chase long ago. But the autopilot 
never would, never could. ' 

Hooker turned off his scope screen 
and went down to the steam room. 
His schedule was shot to hell. He 
was still trying to re-adjust when his 
enemy’s ramscoop field swept across 
his ship. Then both ships were driv- 
ing toward the edge of the universe, 
alone. END

IF 




IF > Short Story 



It Takes All Kinds 

by BRUCE W. RONALD 



The big board flashed its numbers — 
and each one was a sentence of death! 



T 'erry Gordon sat on a simulated 
chrome bench in the great East 
City waiting hall and watched his 
future fading on the huge board that 
covered the entire square-mile roof. 

Few of his high school friends 
would recognize Terry as he sat sulk- 
ing. The short muscular young man 
was known for his engaging ear-to- 
ear smile. Terry Gordon was not 
smiling now as he looked unblink- 
ingly upwards at spot 5,329,462. 
Spot 5,329,462 was Terry Gordon. 
Right now, anyway. 

True, Terry realized, he was a lot 
better off than most people. Of the 
59 million twenty-year-olds who took 
the test, very few would ever make 
the board at all. But that wouldn’t be 
enough. Only ten per cent would 
pass, and Terry knew his odds were 
sHm. 



And* they kept getting slimmer. 

Since East City was headquarters 
for the test, his number had been 
posted quickly. In fact, he had rank- 
ed briefly in the first million as the 
board began its posting. But, as other 
computers around the world tied in- 
to this central board, his rank 
dropped. 

And dropped. 

And dropped. 

Now he was number 5,329,462, 
and the tests were only 91% tabu- 
lated. On a straight percentage basis 
he was all right, but Terry knew it 
didn’t work out that way in prac- 
tice. 

An inhuman voice intoned, 
“ninety-two,” and the roof swam as 
the figures were adjusted to accom- 
modate the test results of more than 
half a million human beings. Terry 



109 




got up and walked down the line, 
straining his thick neck backwards to 
spot his new position. Once he had 
spotted his 14 digit person-identifi- 
cation code unaided, but this time 
he could not. He punched his ID 
code into a wall stand. A half second 
later, he walked away with a strip 
of paper punched 5,397,949. 

As the sturdy, black-chaired Terry 
Gordon walked to his new position, 
he heard a shot and several screams 
from the Losers’ Corner as someone 
committed suicide. Not me, thought 
Gordon. Quickly he tried to evaluate 
the new results. It isn't good, he 
thought. Vm still ahead of straight 
percentages but not by anywhere near 
as much. 

T ^he population explosion and the 
technological explosion mush- 
roomed together, and Terry, along 
with 59,000,000 other twenty-year- 
olds all over the world, was a victim 
of the crossfire. Too many people, 
not enough jobs. They tried reducing 
the workweek, but that didn’t work; 
eliminated jobs were manual or su- 
pervisory in nature. The jobs which 
remained require a lot of time at 
work. 

The world went on a double shift. 
That helped — but not enough. 
Service jobs increased. Again not 
enough, and the computers and their 
lesser brothers took over most of 
these. 

It was decided that all jobs would 
require a college education. Without 
exception. College was made free, 
but enrollment limited to those most 
deserving. At first, the top one-third 
of a high school class was eligible, 



with room left over for the duller 
sons of those who could afford the 
fantastic freight of seven years of 
extra schooling. Then it became 
25%, and nobody could get in just 
with money. Twenty — fifteen — 
and now ten per cent. The world 
had finally taken birth control seri- 
ously, but Terry Gordon would suffer 
what the label-loving historians had 
termed “the Blind Decades.” 

None of this was fair, obviously, 
but it worked. 

Terry Gordon wanted to pass the 
test. He had to pass it. Since child- 
hood he knew that he had to be not 
one of the 900 but one of the ten. 
His class psychiatrist had said he 
had a “good little kid” syndrome. 
“I must be good. I must be right. I 
must be in complete control.” The 
only way to keep in control of any- 
thing was to pass this test. 

“Ninety-three.” 

Terry didn’t bother to look for 
himself. He stood in line and used 
the PIC tracer. He’d been bumped 
less than 62,000 spaces, about three 
thousand more than straight percen- 
tage. If it doesn't get any worse than 
that I can make it. He tried to smile 
and realized it was only a grimace so 
he quit. Someone — a girl, Terry 
thought — threw herself off a rail- 
ing. Too dangerous in that corner. 
Even if my number — even when 
my number, he corrected himself 
dryly, gets over there I'm not going 
to stand under it. There are no rules 
that say I have to stand there. 

He was now in front of a Boozer. 
He stared at it for a few minutes un- 
til he realized that he was now 
qualified to order a drink. He 



no 



IF 




stepped up before tbc machine and 
inserted his credit card, establishing 
automatically his right to drink. 

The machine flashed back, 
“What’s your pleasure, Mr. Gor- 
don?” and Terry froze, unable to 
think clearly. Whafs that drink 
they're always having on TV? Oh, 
yes. He pressed the Martini button. 

After one sip a pretty blonde girl 
bumped into him, spilling his drink. 
“I’m sorry,” she stammered.” I was 
looking for my number. You want 
to hit me?” 

“I don’t care what they say,” 
Terry replied gallantly, “I don’t be- 
lieve in hitting girls. Especially 
pretty ones.” 

The tall blonde girl giggled, but 
not objectionably. “Then I’ll buy you 
a new drink. What were you hav- 
ing?” 

“Martini,” Terry said it as if he’d 
been drinking for years. “But that’s 
all right.” 

“It was my fault you spilled yours. 
Besides, I’ve never ordered a drink 
before. I think I’ll have one, too.” 

She punched the Boozer’s Martini 
button, but forgot to insert her 
credit card. Gordon helped her like 
an old hand. When she received the 
first drink, she handed him one of 
the disposable plastic glasses. “I’m 
Nova Dale.” She had dimples when 
she smiled. 

“Terry Gordon,” replied the 
stocky young man. “What’s your 
standing?” 

“I’m not quite sure . ” 

“Ninety-four,” said the computer. 
It said the “four” badly. 

“Let me have your ID card a sec- 
ond. Here, hold this.” He traded her 



the drink for her card and copied 
her PIC number on a piece of paper 
(since it was in poor taste to hold 
onto another person’s card), then 
walked over to the tracer. She turn- 
ed out to be in a slightly better 
position than he. “You’re 5,509,999,” 
Terry said. “I’m not doing that well. 
I’m 5,524,322.” He was trying to be 
pleasant. 

Unsuccessfully. 

“Why are the last percentage 
▼ V points so high in accep- 
tances?” she asked. 

“Rich kids. Tutors.” He gulped 
at his Martini and instantly re- 
gretted it. 

“I hope we both make it,” she 
said. 

“If it goes on like that last percen- 
tage, you’ll make it and I won’t.” 
Nova Dale tried to be helpful. 
“What’ll you do if you don’t?” 

“I’ve got to.” 

“But . .” 

“I’ve just got to.” 

“I didn’t think being an Also 
Serve was so bad.” 

“The hell you say.” 

She pouted. 

“Ninety-five,” announced the com- 
puter. 

“We’re getting down to the short 
hairs. Nova.” He took his place in 
the tracer line as a young man went 
berserk in the losers’ Corner and 
had to be shot down by the police. 
He returned to Nova with a grin 
from ear to ear. “They only got 
their share,” he yelled to her. “I’m 
5,583,264 and you’re 23 thousand 
places better.” Suddenly he realized 
he was holding Nova’s arm. He re- 



IT TAKES ALL KINDS 



111 




leased her but continued to bubble, 
“Straight percentages, Nova. Only 
five per cent more to go, and there 
are 317,000 places left. I may — I 
just might — make it!” 

“Wonderful.” 

“Let me buy you a drink. You’re 
very pretty, you know.” It was very 
true, but he still didn’t know quite 
why he said it. 

“Thank you,” she said, replying to 
the compliment. She tried to tell him 
she didn’t want a drink but he was 
already marching toward the Boozer. 
She took a deep breath and drained 
her glass. “Adult,” she muttered as 
Terry returned. 

“What?” 

“Nothing.” 

They walked to a spot where they 
could visually spot their numbers 
overhead but Terry suggested they 
go no further. 

“Why?” she asked. 

There was a burst of flame from 
Ihe Losers’ Corner, making the ques- 
tion academic. Nova Dale considered 
the incident, took another sip and 
announced, “I guess our educational 
system does produce a lot of pres- 
sure.” 

He nodded gravely. 

A human voice usurped the com- 
puter. “There have been a large 
number of score results reported 
within the last minute. We will skip 
a report at 96 per cent and go di- 
rectly to 97 as soon as the informa- 
tion is digested. Hang on — stay 
loose — keep cool. This public serv- 
ice message is brought to you by 
God and His representatives in your 
friendly neighborhood church or 
synagogue.” 



N ova sipped at her drink, made a 
sour face, then smiled at the in- 
tense young man. “I’m glad the re- 
sults are coming in quickly now. I 
hate suspense — except on TV of 
course. I ’member, in my TV drama 
watching class, they told us suspense 
was the agonizing wait for the in- 
evitable .... You know, without 
my heels you’d be as tall as I am.” 
Staring up at the ceiling, Terry 
Gordon replied, “Yeah, L guess I 
would be. Hey, there’s my number.” 
“I think I’ll take off my heels.” 
She did. 

“Your number is about 20,000 
that way.” 

She stood up directly in front of 
him. “You trying to get rid of me?” 
“Gosh no, I like you.” 

She started to say something, 
stopped, then blurted out, “You go- 
ing to shack up with somebody to- 
night?” 

“No,” he answered. “I know we’re 
entitled to, graduating to adulthood 
and all, but I — ah — well, I didn’t 
want to apply for a trial marriage 
right away and . .” Terry Gordon 
realized his dark face was turning 
red. “Well, college starts in three 
days, you know.” 

“Did you know they only used to 
teach school nine months a year?” 

“I heard that. Those old kids 
must’ve never learned anything.” He 
took a big swallow of his Martini. 
“Ah, are you?” 

“Am I what?” 

“Shacking up?” 

“Well, there is this boy . .” 
“Ninety-seven,” said the inhuman 
voice. 

“Moment of truth,” he yelled and 

IF 



112 




ran for the tracer, leaving Nova in 
mid-coquette. He was one of the first 
in line and returned quickly. 

“How was it?” Nova Dale asked. 
“Worse. You’ve got it made.” 

“I don’t suppose we could trade 
rankings?” 

Terry snorted, “Don’t be an ass.” 
Hurt, she fumbled, “I was only 
trying to help. It doesn’t mean that 
much to me. Really.” 

“I wish we could. You’re only 
5,668,104; I’m 5,713,832. You 
know what that means? I’m only a 
lousy ten thousand or so better than 
straight percentage. I’m not going 
to make it.” 

“There’s still a chance. There’s 
only four more per cent to go.” 
“Three.” 

“I never was very good at math.” 
“Who’s the guy?” Terry asked. 
“What guy?” Nova Dale tossed 
her long blonde hair from side to 
side and drained her glass. 

“The one you’re doing the trial 
marriage with.” 

“Just a guy. I met him in high 
school in a Luke Short course. He’s 
pretty nice and, after all, I figured 
it was time I knew something about 
sex. You know what I mean?” 

He nodded. 

“I mean, why would they give us 
all those courses if they didn’t want 
us to experience life’s greatest so- 
cial experience?” 

“Yeah, I know. There was this 
one girl I might have — ah — tried, 
if that’s the word.” 

“It fits our generation,” she an- 
swered with the air of someone who 
has just said something profound. 
“She didn’t want you?” 



“I never asked.” The burly man 
was blushing again. 

“Gee, you should have. I bet you’d 
be very proficient.” 

“Thank you,” he said solemnly. 
“I’ll buy you a drink this time,” 
Nova said. 

“Let me.” 

“It’s my turn.” 

W hile the tall blonde was getting 
a round from the nearest 
Boozer, the computer announced the 
arrival of the latest figures. Terry 
Gordon checked the results and 
found that he was now at position 
5,776,834, while Nova was a safe 
5,725,399. 

Two more percentage points to go, 
he thought. And if it keeps going up 
like that, Vye had it. Til miss out by 
a couple of thousand. Boy, it's hot 
in here. 

Nova returned with the drinks. He 
accepted his and blurted out gallant- 
ly, “For a tall girl, you’ve got a real 
great figure.” 

“Thank you.” She smiled and held 
the smile for a full three seconds. 
Finally, “How did you make out?” 
“It’s going to be close as hell. I’m 
only a little better than straight per- 
centages. If the next two percen- 
tage points get 62,000 each. I’ve had 
it.” 

“It isn’t fair. You want to go to 
college so badly and you may not 
make it; I don’t really care and I 
probably will. It isn’t fair. 

“I’ve read that just coming from 
a worker’s family gives a person a 
much better chance on the tests. In- 
tellectual stimulation at an early age, 
they say.”

“What’s your father do?” 
“Insurance estimator.” 

“Gee, that’s a pretty good job. 
The most I really hoped for was 
fireman or subway emergency actu- 
ator or bellhop or something like 
that. You know, you’re the nicest 
sexy girl I’ve ever met.” 

“You know, for a short man, you 
show no predisposition to plump- 
ness.” 

“Thank you. I played a lot of 
football in high school. First string 
tackle.” 

“I thought so.” Nova took a good 
swallow without grimacing. “And, 
for an intense young man, you’re 
very polite. I know what you must 
be going through.” 

“I wish I’d met you before that 
other guy did. I’d like to be married 
to you tonight.” 

“I would have liked that, too.” 
“Ninety-nine.” 

Terry Gordon’s knees jellied, and 
Nova had to go to the tracer with his 
PIC number. 

Ifs not fair, he thought as he sat 
down on a pink bench, not fair to 
drag it out like this, Vm going to 
lose. Why couldn't my father have 
been a worker? He took a good swal- 
low from his new drink. No, I can't 
blame anybody else — that's cheap. 
Why didn't I study harder? 

Nova Dale returned. “You’re 
5,840,943. Is that good?” 

He shook his head. “Less than 
60,000 places left. I’ve had it.” 
Nova sat on the bench beside him 
as there was a flurry of gunfire 
from the Losers’ Corner. She put 
her arm around him. “You wouldn’t 
do that, would you?” 



“No, but I sure as hell feel like 

it.” 

“If the percentage holds, you’ll 
make it.” She gulped at her Martini. 
“Besides, if you’ve done your 
best . .” 

“I have to be in control. My 
psychiatrist told me so.” 

“Are you angry with me because 
I have a higher score?” 

He shook his head again. “I’m 
just mad at myself for not doing 
better. Somebody once said ‘Ninety 
per cent of everything is junk.’ ” He 
smiled, as though it hurt his lips. 
“Actually ‘junk’ wasn’t the word. He 
ate his pseudo-olive. “I’ve got to 
make the ten per cent, don’t you 
see?” 

“I see.” She nodded gravely, 
stroking the back of his head. 

“No, you don’t, but I think I love 
you.” 

She kissed him. 

“It’s against the law to kiss any- 
body in public, but thank you.” 

“Ninety-nine point five.” The 
computer voice seemed to enjoy the 
torture. 

“I’ll go get the results,” he offer- 
ed. “I think I can walk this time.” 

“And I’ll get us another drink. 
These things aren’t bad after you 
get used to ’em.” 

A fter a few minutes he returned 
to accept his fourth Martini and 
tell her, “You’re in. I’ve had it; I’m 
5,873,450.” 

“You still have a chance.” 
“Yeah, but it’s a slim one. More 
than a quarter of a million people 
are trying to get in, and there are 
only 26,550 places left. If I make

it/’ he said, sitaring down at the 
floor, “would you marry me for 
three days?” 

“I thought you’d never ask,” Nova 
replied. 

A human voice announced to the 
waiting crowd, “Final results are in. 
They’ll be processed and announced 
in one minute.” 

There was a scream from the 
Losers’ Corner. 

“Here’s to higher education and 
the 5,900,000 people who enter col- 
lege in three days. I hope I’m one 
of them.” 

“I hope so, too,” Nova answered. 

“And here’s to our marriage.” 

“Yeah, that too. You will be 
kind?” 

Terry Gordon nodded, wondering 
why the room seemed to turn slight- 
ly when he closed his eyes. “I’ve 
got to make it,” he repeated. “I mean 
— I don’t think I could get married 
unless I get accepted. You know 
what I mean? The sus — suscess — ” 

“Successful.” 

“Yeah. Sussessful Sexual Adjust- 
ment Class. I did real well on my 
final in that course.” 

“Me too. And I do understand, 
Terry. I mean, I guess I love you. 
Funny isn’t it?” 

“Sure is.” 

“I mean we just met and all.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Do you shppose we’re drunk?” 

“I guess so. I didn’t think it’d be 
like this.” 

Nova Dale smiled and tossed her 
long blonde hair from side to side. 
“But it is sorta nice to be grown 
up and able to drink and get married 
and all.” 



“Yeah.” 

“You don’t want to talk much 
now, do you?” 

Terry Gordon took her free hand 
in his. “You’re not only buriiful, 
you’re unnerstanding.” 

“Here is the posting of the final 
results,” announced the computer in 
what Terry thought to be a com- 
passionate, if inhuman voice. He 
sprang to his feet, and he and Nova 
joined the jostling crowd around the 
tracer. He shoved her ahead of him. 
Their plastic Martini glasses splash- 
ed, then spilled and fell on the floor. 

She filed her 14 numbers into the 
machine. Instantly, she had her 
answer: 5,838,832. “I’m in,” she 
screamed. 

Terry Gordon was in front of the 
tracer now. He made a mistake and 
cleared the machine. His hands 
would not obey his mind. Finally 
with a dozen other aspirants threat- 
ening his life if he didn’t hurry, he 
entered his PIC number. 

And received in return: 5,900,001. 

^^Qomebody has to get that num- 

O her,” Nova tried to console 
the ex-high school football star. 

“I only needed one more. Just 
one.” He sat on an orange bench 
with his head in his hands. “There’s 
no prize for second.” He pulled a 
folder from his pocket. 

“Does this mean . ” 

He stood up and faced her. 
“Nova, I love you and I’d still like 
to marry you tonight, but . 

She pouted. 

“You know, in my state. I’d be 
using you.” 

“That’s all right,” she said. “Some

masochism is pleasant and perfectly 
within the boundari^ of so-called 
normal experience, according to my 
teacher. I wouldn’t mind, if you’ll 
just be kind.” 

“I’ll use you kindly.” 

“I’ll call that guy; chances are he 
can still find a girl for tonight. I’ll 
call my father, too, and tell him 
about my change of plans. I hope 
we can find an apartment at this 
stage of the game.” She began dial- 
ing on her communicator. 

Terry Gordon just stared at the 
pamphlet explaining the test. There 
must be a loophole somewhere. But 
he couldn’t find it. “After the com- 
pletion of the test,” he read aloud, 
“5,900,000 winners will be chosen 
for seven years of basic higher edu- 
cation. Those who successfully com- 
plete the seven years will be assigned 
employment consistent with their 
abilities and, as is possible, consis- 
tent with their inclinations as well.” 
Officialese, 

Losers’ Comer was bedlam. A few 
shots were heard; screams and 
shouts of anger filled the air. Sud- 
denly a bullet ricocheted off the side 
of the near-by tracer and pranged 
into the bench beside Terry. Its 
velocity nearly spent, it probably 
couldn’t have done much damage, 
but it did wake Terry out of his 
lethargy. A man could get killed 
here, he realized. 

“Terry,” Nova announced, “my 
Daddy wants to talk with you.” 

Nova was surprised when Terry 
practically grabbed her communica- 
tor. “How do you do, Mr. Dale.” 
Pause. “Yes, I will be kind and I 
want lo talk with you . ” 



^ do you want?” 

▼V Chief Testing Officer Ray- 
mon Bristow was six feet four inches 
tall and weighed 240 pounds. Some 
people said he got the job because 
he had the physique for it. Admin- 
istering the test was bad enough, 
Bristow had told his friends, answer- 
ing the complaints was much worse. 
He stared across the twelve-by- 
twelve office just one floor above 
the great waiting hall and glared 
at the couple who had managed to 
reach him. 

“Unusual enough to see a couple 
here, what do you want?” 

Nova cut off Terry’s prepared 
opening. “We’re going to be married 
just as soon as he convinces you.” 

“Nobody convinces me of any- 
thing. We don’t accept changes be- 
cause order, no matter how rotten, 
is preferable to chaos, no matter 
how noble.” 

“Yes, sir,” Gordon blurted out. 
“The Roman Empire and the Dark 
Ages.” 

“I was thinking more of the old 
California educational system. Now, 
get to the point so I can throw you 
out. You’re not here to kill me be- 
cause you volunteered for a probe 
and you’re clean. You’re not here 
to complain about the system or the 
test, either.” 

“Did the probe tell you that?” 

The huge man sn6rted, “Kids 
come here to kill me, adults to 
scream of injustice. I don’t know why 
you’re here. He lit a huge round 
cigar. “Now, for Freud’s sake, 
talk.” 

“I’m Terry Gordon and I was 
5,900,001.”

IF 




Chief Testing Officer Raymond 
Bristow choked on his cigar and 
turned his back on the couple, “So? 
Somebody has to be the first to lose. 
You’re no more pitiable than the 
loser at 59,000,000. I’m sorry for 
all losers, but I can’t do anything 
about it. Now get out.” 

“I haven’t explained why I have 
a right to go to school.” 

“All right.” Bristow turned, his 
face composed now. “Explain it and 
then get out.” 

“Fifty-nine million people took 
that test today.” 

“About that,” Bristow hedged. 
“About that? Because if 59,000,- 
010 took the test I’m entitled any- 
way.” 

“Kid, ten per cent is a guideline. 
The rule specifically states ‘After the 
test is completed, 5,900,000 winners 
will be chosen for seven years of 
basic higher education.’ Those are 
the rules, not some stuff about ten 
per cent. Besides there were less 
than 59,000,000 who took the test. 
Good-by, kid.” 

“I’m not through.” 

“Kid, I’m getting anxious to meet 
some irate parents. At least they 
get to the point.” 

“Will you grant that almost all 
who took the test were twenty years 
old?” 

“How old are the two of you?” 
Nova missed irony and answered. 
Gordon pressed on, “Now, Nova’s 
father is an insurance man . ” 
Bristow interrupted, “Have him 
sell me some; I don’t think I’ll live.” 
“He says, out of ten million 
twenty years olds, 217,300 won’t 
last the year.” 



“It’s the same rate as 1958, Daddy 
says,” Nova contributed. “Medical 
science and the banning of private 
cars have kept the death rate down 
in spite of hyper-population.” 

“It’s a fine lecture,” grunted Bris- 
tow, “but it changes nothing.” 
“Would you agree a person has to 
be alive to go to college?” 

Bristow glowered at the couple. 
“I see what you’re driving at — 
somebody may die before college 
starts. Sorry, Gordon, the rule doesn’t 
say we deliver 5,900,000 bodies, it 
says we pick that many.” 

“Nova, darling, he said it!” He 
jumped up and down, embracing her. 
“I said what?” Bristow demanded. 
“You said you pick that many. 
Now you can’t pick a dead man.” 
The big man exhaled a huge cloud 
of smoke. “Let me try being very 
direct: what the hell do you mean?” 

T erry took a deep breath. “The 
test was over at four o’clock. 
The test results weren’t finally an- 
nounced until ten p.m.” 

“So?” 

“So, I figure about eighty-five 
people ahead of me in the listing 
are dead. They don’t need their spots, 
and I do. And, the way the rules 
are set up. I’m entitled to one of 
them.” 

Nova looked at Terry. “Eighty- 
five?” 

“Sure. Figure it out for yourself. 
Per ten million you have 217,300 
fatalities yearly — that’s a little less 
than 130,000 for 5,900,000. Divide 
that by the number of days in a 
year, and it’s about 350, or more 
than fourteen per hour.” 



IT TAKES ALL KINDS 



117 




“Aad you can’t choose a dead 
man to go to college. It’s not copese- 
tic.” Since tihe Chief Testing Officer 
was staring at her, she amended, “It’s 
not fair.” 

“Fairness,” stated Bristow, moving 
to the computer imput which took 
up one of the twelve-foot walls, “has 
nothing to do with it.” 

“It’s not right,” Nova said, be- 
ginning to cry. 

“Ditto,” said Bristow, typing on 
the computer keys. 

“It’s not defensible,^" Terry Gor- 
don stated flatly. 

The computer sprang to life and 
file cards spewed from the output 
orifice. “Now that,” said Bristow, 
is probably the smartest thing you’ve 
said tonight.” He picked up the cards 
and flipped them in his hand. “Your 
mortality tables aren’t too accurate 
over a short span of time. Actually 
almost one hundred winners have 
died.” He flipped a switch and an- 
nounced into the microphone. “At- 
tention. Since 97 people who have 
qualified for college died before test 
results were completed and posted, 
we are revising the results. This 'will 
admit the first 97 people over the 
5,900,000 rating.” Bristow flipped 
the cards into the machine, typed 
cancel these cards and revise the list 
accordingly to 5,900,000. 

“You’re lucky,” Bristow said, “that 
this machine is tied into payroll. We 
knew the deaths immediately.” 

“Thank you,” Terry Gordon said, 
his knees weak with wonder. “We 
did it. Nova. I’m not junk.” 



“Where are you two shacking up 
tonight?” 

“We don’t know.” 

The Chief Testing Officer dug in- 
to his pockets. “Here’s my key and 
location finder. I won’t be using my 
place tonight. After I get done listen- 
ing to 5,900,098’s sad tale and a few 
thousand parents I’m going to get 
very drunk.” 

Nova and Terry both thanked 
him. 

Profusely. 

“I’m not doing this for you, kid. 
I’m doing it for Edison.” 

The couple paused for a moment 
at the door. 

“Edison and all the world’s other 
great men who wouldn’t have passed 
this damn test. You’ve got guts. I’ll 
say that for you. You damn well 
better put ’em to good use.” 

I t was three in the morning when 
Terry Gordon and the three-day 
Mrs. Gordon reached the Chief Test- 
ing Officer’s beautiful apartment. In 
front of a pseudowood fire, the cou- 
ple drank a glass of champagne 
Nova had purchased while Terry 
picked up the license. 

“You know,” Terry said, “I’ve 
been thinking about what Mr. Bris- 
tow said. I have a hell of a responsi- 
bility. For all those people who didn’t 
make it.” 

“You’ll live up to it, Terry,” Nova 
said. “And besides that, you will 
be kind.” 

“I will.” 

He was. END

IF * Short Story 



THE ACCOMPLICE 

by VERNOR VINGE 

Somebody was stealing computer 
time . but for what purpose? 



T '^here was a thief on my staff. 

Hell. It was someone I trusted, 
too; it had to be. 

Arnold Su grinned enthusiastically 
as he laid the proof on my desk. 
“Computer time is expensive, Mr. 
Royoe,” he pontificated. Now that 
was la discovery. “And someone has 
embezzled more than 70 hours on 
our 4D5 during the last year.” 

I raised my eyes prayerfully to the 
mural that covered three walls of my 
office. The holograph gave the 
three-dimensional illusion that we 
were perched among tall conifers 
somewhere in the Canadian Rock- 
ies. You’d never guess that my of- 
fice is buried under the Royce build- 
ing in Greater San Diego. 

“God preserve me from your ef- 
ficiency, Arnold. Seventy hours on 
the 4D5 computer is worth $400,- 
000. You’re an extraordinary securi- 
ty officer; it only took you a year 
to discover that someone is robbing 
us blind.” 



Su was pained by my unjustified 
criticism. “It’s someone with a pri- 
vate computer readout.” 

“You’re pretty good at the ob- 
vious.” Most computers, especially 
the really big ones like our 4D5, 
can be programmed by remote con- 
soles in the offices of favored com- 
pany researchers. Such use is auto- 
matically recorded for later review. 

“So it must be someone highly 
place in the company. Someone 
smart. Chief, he actually pro- 
grammed the computer to cover up 
for him. The 4D5 has been “keep- 
ing two sets of books” to conceal 
the embezzlement from our weekly 
checks.” 

O f course there have been cases 
of computer-camouflaged em- 
bezzlement (usually of money) in 
the past — that’s one reason why 
CPA’s are computer technicians. 
However it takes a real expert to 
thoroughly cover his tracks. Evident- 



119 




ly W€ were up against an expert. 
“How did you discover the theft, 
then, Amie?” 

Arnold’s grin spread even further 
across his face. This was the ques- 
tion he had been waiting for. “Boss, 
you really don’t appreciate me. I’ve 
been expecting something like this 
for a long time. My section has an 
agreement with Control Data Corpo- 
ration. Every year we audit their 
computer complex with ours, and 
vice versa. That way the problem is 
reduced to a battle of the computers, 
and we can detect this sort of auto- 
mated deception. But the crook start- 
ed embezzling, something after the 
1992 audit, so he wasn’t discovered 
until yesterday.” 

I picked up Arnold’s report. “Any 
idea who the culprit is?” Four mil- 
lion dollars, I thought. If I never got 
my hands on the crook who — no 
wonder our general efficiency had 
fallen off in the last year. 

“Not the vaguest,” Su replied, 
“except that he’s a company VIP 
with computer privileges. Now if 
you had just let me bug the execu- 
tive offices and washrooms . .*’ 

“You know, Arnie,” I said slow- 
ly, “sometimes I think you would 
have been just as comfortable on 
Herr Himmler’s staff as you are 
here.” 

Arnold turned red. “Sorry, Boss, 
I didn’t mean — ” 

“Never mind.” Su is a good 
man, the graduate of one of this 
country’s best schools of business ad- 
ministration. It’s just that he’s an in- 
curable snoop, which makes him, 
properly supervised, an excellent se- 
curity officer. 



Su continued, subdued, “We can’t 
even reconstruct what sort of prob- 
lems the computer was doing dur- 
ing those 70 hours. The thief did a 
magnificent job on that computer.” 
I looked down the valley in the 
mural. Someone I trusted had sold 
me out. I’d worked twenty years to 
make the name Royce synonymous 
with computers and to make Royce 
Techonology, Inc., competitive with 
IBM and CDC. In that time. I’ve 
collected a lot of good men under 
one corporate roof. They are the 
backbone of Royce, more than I, 
with my high school diploma, ever 
was. And one of them was rotten. 
Who? 

T '-here was one individual who 
might be able to find that an- 
swer. I got up and started for the 
door. “We’re going to see Howard.” 
“Prentice?” asked Su. He grabbed 
his report off my desk and followed 
me. “You don’t think he’s responsi- 
ble?” Arnold was genuinely shocked. 

“Of course not,” I said, locking 
the door to my office. 

When we were out of earshot of 
my secretaries and their recording 
equipment I continued. “Whoever 
we’re up against obviously knows 
computers inside and out. We can’t 
catch him with old-fashioned auto- 
mation techniques. We’re going to 
have to get him by exploiting the hu- 
man angle. Howard Prentice has 
been kicking around longer than 
both of us put together. He knows 
human nature, and he knows more 
ways to skin a sucker than we’ll ever 
imagine. He makes the perfect in- 
vestigator.” I noticed the hurt look 



120 



IF 




on Arnold’s face and added quick- 
ly; “On a unique case like this.” 

It’s only five minutes by aircar 
from Chula Vista to the Royce Re- 
search Labs at Oceanside. In fifteen 
minutes we were standing in the 
hall outside Prentice’s lab. I prefer to 
see people in person rather than by 
phone — I get more out of them. 
But this time it backfired: Prentice 
wasn’t in his lab, which was locked. 
I was starting back to the parking 
lot when Su stopped me. 

“Just a minute, Boss.” He pro- 
duced a flat, metal plate and in- 
serted it in the lock. “Master key,” 
he explained confidentially. “Now 
we can wait for him in here.” 

I was too surprised to bawl him 
out for this latest invasion of priva- 
cy. Besides, he’ll never grow up. 

The room lighted up as we enter- 
ed. Packed against one wall were 
the usual programming typers and 
TV screens. I also recognized a high- 
resolution video tape recorder and a 
picture reader. Stacked in orderly 
rows along the work benches were 
hundreds of Prentice’s oil paintings. 
Sometimes I wondered whether he 
considered himself an artist or a sci- 
entist — though I didn’t care what 
he did with his time as long as he 
completed assigned projects. Su was 
already rununaging among the paint- 
ings — admiring them I think. 

Prentice couldn’t be out for long. 
As a section chief he was in charge 
of thirty different computer labs. 
And right then his section was busy 
designing the optical and communi- 
cations system for that probe NASA 
wanted to boost out toward Alpha 
Centauri A next year. 



I sat down in the ohair before the 
computer console and tried to re- 
lax. 

The holograph on his desk caught 
my eye. It was a color pic of Howard 
and Moira taken on their diamond 
wedding anniversary. Moira must be 
more than ninety years old. Only one 
woman in a billion could look even 
faintly attractive after a haul like 
that — but tall and slim, somehow 
Moira managed it. She was holding 
Howard’s arm like a fifteen-year- 
old who’s just discovered boys. 
Quite a gal; quite a man she had, 
too. Howard must be pushing 95. 
You know, he personally worked for 
Thomas Edison? Fact. The man’s like 
history. When the" 1929 depression 
came he was a top executive for 
some oil company out East. The de- 
pression apparently soured him on 
industry. He spent the next forty 
years — an ordinary adult lifetime 
— in Greenwich Village as an artist- 
bum, a beatnik. Then, some time 
around 1970, he changed careers 
again. He entered college. If you’re 
old enough, maybe you remember 
the headlines: 75 YR OLD FROSH 
VOWS HE’LL GET Ph.D — in 
math, no less. And he did it. How- 
ard’s been with me for fifteen years. 

One of my best men. I tapped an 
impatient tattoo on the arms of the 
ohair. But where the devil was he 
now? 

“Boss, this stuff is tremendous!” 
I stood up to see what Arnold was 
talking about. He was pointing at 
several paintings he had pulled out 
from the bottom of the pile. Su is 
quite an art and film fan. He has a 
tape collection of all films made 



THE ACCOMPLICE 



121 




since 1980, as well as a very large 
collection of paintings from all 
periods. 

He lhad reason to admire How- 
ard’s paintings, though. Prentice is 
an excellent, maybe a great painter. 
Thou^ he’s done many traditional 
abstractionist pieces, Howard has 
been a neorealist ever since ' I’ve 
known him. Take the paintings in the 
lab; they were all clear and unam- 
biguous as far as execution went. 
There were landscapes, portraits, in- 
teriors. But the landscapes were 
from no area in the real world. And 
the portraits were expressionless mug 
shots: face on, quarter face, profile. 
Not all of the subjects were even 
human. Every cam/as was the same 
size. Over the years I often asked 
Howard about this, but he always 
answered with some line about artis- 
tic profundity. I don’t think he even 
let us see everything he did. 

A rnold had called me over to see 
three landscapes he had dis- 
covered. When he placed them side 
by side it was like a composite 
photo — a panoramic view. It was 
one of the most spectacular things 
I’d seen by Prentice. 

When I looked at it, the lights in 
the room seemed to dim a little. 
In the picture it was night. A sickle 
moon lit a deep valley or mountain 
pass. Our viewpoint was halfway up 
the side of the valley. Scrubby brush 
and volcanic slag were visible near- 
by. Far away, down in the center of 
the valley, was a castle or fortress, 
its immense black structure outlined 
by the moonlight. Though vast and 
strong, somehow it was also decayed 



and diseased — a skull rotting in the 
earth. Around the castle were fields 
of purple flowers glimmering faint- 
ly with their own light (fluorescing 
paint?). But the flowers weren’t 
beautiful — even at this distance 
they were fungus growing on death’s 
decay. 

I pulled my attention away from 
the landscape. It was the most hostile 
I’d seen by Prentice. And somehow 
it was familiar. I often got that 
“seen-before” feeling with Howard’s 
stuff — though usually his land- 
scapes provoked awe rather than 
fdar. The picture would have been 
even more impressive if it had been 
painted on a single canvas rather 
than split up on separate ones. 

Then I noticed the picture reader 
at the end of the bench. We use pic 
readers to program images directly 
into the logic of a computer. This is 
an expensive procedure since it pre- 
empts a lot of the computer’s cir- 
cuits. It’s usually simpler to keep pic- 
torial information on tape, but some- 
times we want thp computer to oper- 
ate directly and continuously on in- 
formation in a picture — to alter a 
perspective, say — and we have to 
use the reader. 

A horrible suspicion was forming 
in my mind. I picked up one of the 
paintings and laid it on the flat glass 
plate at the top of the reader. It fit 
perfectly. Now I knew why all the 
paintings were, the same size. 

Forgetting Su, I reached up and 
pulled a heavy notebook off the 
shelf above the bench. I had to 
snoop. I had to find some legitimate 
excuse for the man I now suspected. 

The notebook was a motion study. 



122 



IF 




We use them when wc have to pro- 
gram the computer on changing 
spacial relations — as with com- 
plicated machinery; the computer 
has to know the position of every 
part of the machine at every instant 
in order to predict performance and 
detect bugs. The interior page was 
titled: Vol. XIX — Hand Techruk. 
I riffled through the pages. There 
were thousands of rough sketches 
showing the human hand in every 
position. Beside each sketch was a 
numerical description of the motion 
from that position to the next. 

Volume XIX? Why, Prentice, 
must have a separate notebook for 
facial expressions, a notebook for 
every class of motion! And it was all 
set for programming. His project — 
whatever it was — was huge. He 
must have been planning this for 
years. From the evidence in the lab 
it was certainly big enough to cost 
70 hours of 4D5 time. Prentice was 
the rat all right. But why had he 
embezzled the time? And what had 
he done with it? 

T '-here was a noise from the door- 
way. Arnold looked up from the 
picture he had been admiring and 
said cheerfully, “Hi, Howard!” 
“Hello.” Prentice set his briefcase 
on the bench and hung up his jacket. 
The he turned to look at me. “This 
is my private office, Bob,” he said 
mildly. 

I didn’t bite. I was too mad for 
subtlety. “Prentice, you’ve got some 
explaining to do.” I gestured at the 
paintings and the picture reader. 
“Someone’s been stealing 4D5 time, 
and I think it’s you.” 



Prentice glanced at Su. “So you 
finally ran a cross-audit, eh, Arnold? 
Well, I knew I wouldn’t have more 
than a year. I got what I gambled 
for.” 

Su looked even more surprised 
than I felt. Prentice had spent a 
whole year concealing the fraud, and 
now he was calmly confessing. 

“Just what was worth $4,000,000 
of Royce time?” I snapped. 

“Would you like to see?” He did 
not wait for an answer. “I’ve got 
one of the last tapes right here.” 
He reached into his brief case and 
pulled out a TV tape cartridge. 

“Moira and I have always been 
appalled by the fact that so many 
art forms are beyond the means of 
a single artist. Take the film in- 
dustry: most movies cost many mil- 
lions of dollars and require the 
services of hundreds of artists 
— actors, directors, photographers.” 
Prentice threaded the tape through 
the multiple head of the video tape 
recorder. You’d think he had in- 
vited us over for home movies. The 
gall of the man. I didn’t stop him 
though. I suppose I was curious. 
What could be worth a ruined ca- 
reer to Prentice? 

“Anyway,” he continued, “back 
around 1957, I saw a way to give 
film-making to the individual artist. 
Since then, everything Moira and I 
have done has been directed toward 
this goal. At first we didn’t realize 
how complicated the job was and 
how far computers had to go before 
they could help us with what we 
wanted. But I got my degree, and we 
kept at it.” 

He hooked the tape into the recep- 



THE ACCOMPLICE 



123 




tipn cartridge and snapped the cover 
into place. “With the aid of tihe 
4D5 we’ve animated one of the great 
novels of this century.” 

“You’ve used the 4D5 to make a 
cartoon!” Arnold was obviously 
fascinated by the concept. He had 
completely forgotten that Prentice 
was talking about a crime. 

For the first time since he had 
entered the lab, Prentice seemed an- 
noyed. “Yes, I guess it is a cartoon 
— like da Vinci’s Mona Lisa is a 
doodle. Cut the lights, will you, Ar- 
nold?” 

The lights went out, and Prentice 
turned on the recorder. The TV 
screen on the wall came alive. I 
gasped. Night, The landscape with 
the purple flowers. But what a dif- 
ference. This was a window on an- 
other world. If I had felt uneasy 
looking at the paintings, I felt terror 
now. Three tiny figures struggled up 
the side of the valley. Suddenly I 
knew why this scene was familiar. 
Prentice had animated Tolkien’s 
Lord of the Rings! If you’ve ever 
taken high school English (and if 
you haven’t, I’ll hire you — my ego 
needs someone in this outfit with 
less education than I have) I’m sure 
you’ve read Tolkien’s book. We were 
watching the scene where Frodo, 
Samwise, and Gollum come up the 
stairs to Kirth Ungol past the for- 
tress Minas Morgul — the skull thing 
in the valley. Prentice’s version was 
much more realistic and fearsome 
than anything I had ever imagined. 

I realized Prentice was still talk- 
ing. 

“Moira and I worked thirty years 



on the paintings, the motion studies, 
the script, the sound track; but with- 
out the 4D5 to integrate what we 
had created, we’d be left with a 
warehouse full of paintings and note- 
books.” 

The three figures stopped to rest. 
Our viewpoint moved in for a close- 
up. The three were arguing in low, 
frightened tones. Now I knew why 
Prentice’s portraits were expression- 
less; diey were the patterns on which 
Prentice, through the 4D5, imposed 
emotion and movement. 

This was no cartoon. The figures 
were fine portraits, come alive to 
argue in whispers. I could see Fro- 
do’s blank resignation, the fear in 
Samwise, the glittery green of Gol- 
lum’s eyes as he fought with the oth- 
er two. Yet it was all a synthesis of 
oil paintings and motion studies — 
the product of Howard’s genius and 
the 4D5’s analysis. Without a break 
in continuity, the “camera” dollied 
back to reveal the ancient stone stair 
that stretched high into the moun- 
tains. The three stood up and con- 
tinued their long climb toward She- 
lob’s Lair. 

Click, The tape ended. Prentice 
turned on the li^ts. I sat dazed for 
a second, trying to bring myself back 
to the real world. 

“That tape is just five minutes 
long,” said Prentice. “The whole 
animation is more than four hours.” 

Su recovered first. “My God, 
Howard. That’s tremendous. It’s the 
greatest advance in art technique in 
fifty years.” 

“At least,” agreed Prentice. “Now, 
anything a writer or painter can 
imagine can be staged.” 



124 



IF 




“Sure,” I said sarcastically, “as 
long as the painter is willing to 
steal $4,000,000 of computer (time.” 
Prentice turned to me. “Not real- 
ly, Bob. Computer time is only ex- 
pensive because of the scarcity of 
4D5- class computers and the num- 
ber of problems that can’t be solved 
except by the 4D5. On the basis of 
past progress. I’ll wager that in five 
years you’ll be selling computers as 
good as the 4D5 for less than 
$10,000. Anybody who really wants 
an animator will be able to have 
one.” ' 

“And you just couldn’t wait.” 
He smiled, “That’s right. I’ve 
waited thirty years. I don’t know if 
I’ll be around for another five.” 
“Well, I’m going to make you 
wish you’d taken the chance. When 
I get done with you, there’ll be 
nothing left for the Tolkien estate 
to pick over.” 

A rnold broke in, “Just a second. 
Boss — ” 

I turned on him angrily, “Look 
Su, can’t you understand? Prentice 
has stolen $4,000,000 of my 
money r My Voice rose half an oc- 
tave. 

“It’s your money I’m talking 
about. Chief. Did you ever see 
Fantasia or Magica?"' 

“Disney’s feature length anima- 
tion? Yes.” 

“Do you have any idea what they 
cost?” 

“Don’t play games, Arnold. I 
know you’re an expert. How much?” 
""Fantasia was made way back in 
1940. It cost Disney more than 
$2,000,000. But when they got 



around to Magica 35 years later, the 
price tag had risen to $27,000,000, 
even though Magica is a much poor- 
er job. Nowadays, almost any main- 
guard picture — whether animation 
or with real actors — costs more 
than $10,000,000. Howard’s actually 
discovered a cheap way of making 
films.” 

“Why didn’t you just ask for the 
time, then?” I asked Prentice. 

Howard looked stubborn. He has 
his own peculiar brand of integrity. 
“Bob, do you honestly believe you 
would’ve said yes? I’m an artist. I 
may be a good researcher, but that 
was a means to an end. Moira and I 
had to do this, even though I knew 
it’d hurt Royce in the short run.” 

“Chief, it doesn’t matter whether 
Howard planned this to help you or 
not. The point is, he’s dropped a 
fortune in your lap.” 

When Arnold put it that way . 
Four million dollars wasn’t too bad 
for a topnotch movie, and if Howard 
had had organized help, besides his 
wife, it might have cost a lot less. 
It would be at least eight years be- 
fore we miniaturized computers like 
the 4D5 for the consumer market. 
Until then, film-making would re- 
main the prerogative of the large 
organization. It had taken Howard 
years to perfect this technique, so 
we were way ahead of potential 
competition. Figuratively speaking, 
we were standing on the ground 
floor of a whole new industry. 

Su saw that I was swayed. “Well?” 

“Well,” I said grudgingly, “I guess 
we’re in the movie business.” I didn’t 
realize how true I spoke till we got 
that first Oscar. END

IF * Short Story 



THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL 

by W. I. JOHNSTONE 



What lovely people the Earthlings 
were! They were utterly cleliciousi 



T he Snick approached the Earth 
at 86,000 miles per second, de- 
tected the atmosphere and slowed 
up. A little closer in he sensed a 
masterhost and almost forgot to slow 
up for the hydrosphere. And then 
he lost it. 

The Snick was wise with its mil- 
lion years. Although he had never 
before found a masterhost except in 
the water, he knew exactly what to 
do. Retracing his path up to where 
the sense had been the strongest, he 
homed on it and shot westward. 
Three minutes later he was hovering 
above New York City. 

The Snick hesitat^ for only a 
moment, struck by the unexpected 
form the masterhost had adopted 



throughout the entire city. Then he 
dived, the final test. 

The people saw him coming. They 
shouted and pointed at him. A few 
began running. He felt the building 
emotion as he darted straight at a 
small group. This could be the home 
the Snicks had sought for almost a 
thousand years in an empty galaxy. 

He hit the first man in the middle 
of the back and went giddy with 
pleasure as the ecstatic burst of 
emotion flared around the master- 
host. Drunk with celebration he cut 
through man after man until his rap- 
ture was so extreme he glided to 
the street in a stupor. Along the 
street thirty bodies lay as they had 
fallen while twenty-one hundred per- 



126 




sons stared from every conceivable 
place of hiding at the little metal 
cylinder that looked too much like a 
bomb. 

A n hour later the Snick woke. The 
bodies had been removed and 
the watchers had all disappeared. 
For four blocks in every direction 
the city had been desert^. Beyond 
that was a military cordon not even 
a rat could have slipped through. 
The Snick lay alone and thought. 

. He had found a new masterhost. 
Certain features had not fit the uni- 
versal pattern but they probably did 
not matter. Nowhere before had he 
encountered a masterhost that did 
not dwell in water. Nor did he have 
any memory of any masterhost 
whose individual entities all possessed 
an almost identical pseudoform, 
continually. In fact, he would have 
thought it impossible until today. 
But the final test had been conclu- 
sive. The test was what the Snick 
lived for. 

A million years ago the first mas- 
terhost had taught the newly created 
Snick to dive through the master- 
host’s protoplasmic body and tickle 
the insides with a small electric 
shock. To the amebic masterhost 
this was the supreme ecstasy, and 
the Snick thrived on the emotional 
output. But after 700,000 years the 
masterhost died out and the Snicks 
had gone into space to find another. 

They found several, but all in the 
final stages of extinction, and when 
they were gone the Snicks spread 
again into space. And here, after a 
thousand years of drifting he had 
found a new masterhost, young and 



Dumero.us. Gathering together all the 
strength from his recent emotional 
rapture the Snick sent a direotional 
come-home thought code of success 
to three million brother Snicks drift- 
ing in the void. It would take months 
for them all to assemble from 
throughout the universe, even on a 
thought code, but the first would ar- 
rive within days. 

The Snick must now make con- 
tact. The opportunity came imme- 
diately. 

A demolition squad came up the 
street in a heavily armored car. Two 
TV mobile units detached themselves 
from the car and approached, scan- 
ning the Snick from every angle. 
After several minutes a masterhost in 
thick protective shielding came 
toward him. This was contact. 

The Snick was built like a round- 
ed and sealed metal cylinder, twelve 
inches long and three inches in dia- 
meter, with a ten-inch spike pro- 
truding from the head end along the 
central axis. The spike had two pur- 
poses, the first was to promote easy 
entrance into the protoplasmic bodies 
of the masterhost, the second, con- 
tact. Shooting off the ground, the 
Snick hit the masterhost full in the 
face and stopped, the spike through 
the middle of the contact brain. For 
an instant he felt the ecstasy and 
giddiness return, but because it 
was the brain there was something 
else. 

Deep within the contact, almost 
unnoticable to the Snick, was a fear 
and a hate and a hurt. And there 
was something more he couldn’t 
quite catch as it flickered away and 
the masterhost crumpled. 



THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL 



127 




'T^e ecstasy was gone, and the 

A Snick felt the emptiness of the 
void. He did not understand. He had 
tided to make contact and had felt 
the emotional climax. But then .... 
The Snick withdrew from the 
crumpled masterhost and turned 
toward the car. 

The blast hit him without warn- 
ing and knocked him against a build- 
ing. Before he had time to ration- 
alize a second exploded beneath and 
sent him hurtling through the air. 
Immediately he raced skyward and 
two more missiles exploded where 
he had just been. Then he was out 
of sight of the city. 

The Snick flew west, its thoughts 
confused. The masterhost did not 
seem to want contact and yet the 
ecstasy had been real. Just to be sure 
he dived ait every town and tested a 
group of people. It took him only 
a while to learn that the cli- 
max came when he hit them in the 
middle of the upper part of the body 
or in the head. Several times he had 
hit just an arm or leg and had felt 
no rapture. He had gone back to 
those persons and hit them again, ef- 
fectively, but the emotion had an 
undertone that frightened him. He 
learned too that the bodies were not 
protoplasm. They were more or less 
solid and contained a rigid internal 
structure of limestone. 

It wasn’t until he reached the west 
coast that he thought of the second 
test. With three million Snicks on 
the way he must be certain. 

At the beach just north of Con- 
ception Point he made the test. 



Twelve masterhosts were on the 
beach. He hit all twelve, then sank 
into the sea. The emotional rapture 
he drew from the twelve, add^ to 
the ecstasies of his flight west, nearly 
sent his mind into blissful oblivion. 
Half of his thoughts wished there 
had been just two more masterhosts. 
That would have done it. The other 
half told him that then he would 
not have been able to complete the 
second test. He allowed himself 
plenty of time to cool off, just to be 
safe, then jumped back into the air 
and again raced toward the twelve 
on the beach. 

No masterhost moved. No pre- 
climactic emotion reached toward 
him. Almost fearfully he hit the first 
masterhost, crumpled on the beach 
as the contact had been. There was 
nothing. There was the void. 

S hocked, then saddened as reality 
dawned, the Snick stopped to look 
at his victims. 

Victims! The thought and blame 
began to sear. He knew now that 
these beings were not the master- 
host, -that none of the ones he had 
encountered had experienced the 
ecstasy before, and -that none would 
experience it again. He recognized 
then the fleeting glimpse of the 
something leaving the contact. 

Three million Snicks were eagerly 
heading Earthward. It would take 
months for them all to gather, but 
the first would arrive within days. 
The last Man would be gone before 
the last Snick had heard the call.

What has gone hefore • 

Honor Jackson used to be an 
ignorant, graceless savage, fighting 
Amsirs and hating farmers on the 
ruddy wastes of Mars. But all that 
has changed, now; Susiem, the cy- 
bernetic spaceship he has stolen 
from the Amsirs, has given him a 
Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio 
State. 



Now Jackson knows enough to 
wear clothes, and enough to under- 
stand how he came to be a child 
of the Iron Thorn. The Thorn is a 
towering climatological control de- 
vice located in the center of a Mar- 
tian crater. A small tribe of humans 
had managed to make its home there, 
and, as long as they didn*t stray too 
far from the Thorn, could go on 
living long enough to procreate not 



129 





only their own kind but the whole 
batch of half-truths and legends 
which, a thousand years since Susiem 
was stranded on Mars, Jackson has 
now learned to scorn. 

Obviously, Mars was the site of 
some sort of experiment run by 
Associated Midwest Universities. 
Much closer to where Susiem stood 
was another Thorn, around which 
flock Amsirs — humans genetically 
modified to breed true in the form 
of winged, armored, lichen-eating 
creatures. The experiment had been 
running for a thousand years now. 

With the passage of time and the 
accumulation error, the experiment 
had become completely misunder- 
stood both by the barbaric Amsirs 
and the neolithic human control 
group, resulting in a situation Susiem 
cbuldn't understand. Not understand- 
ing, and out of touch with Earth, 
she persistently did nothing. But by 
simple force of native talent, Jack- 
son managed to outwit not only her, 
but, before that, his own kind, and 
the Amsirs. 

He did not quite blunder aboard 
Home Free. With him came Ahmuls, 
an Amsir sport with soft skin, not 
much brains, but very fast reflexes. 
It had been Ahmuls* s job to kill Jack- 
son if he tried anything funny with 
Susiem. But part of Jackson*s com- 
puter-implanted university training 
had included a course in unarmed 
combat, and Ahmuls was sullenly 
cowed by the time Susiem, Jackson 
and he reached Earth, after he had 
had his damages repaired by Susiem* s 
doctor, and Jackson had been min- 
istered to for various scars and hurts 
inflicted during his adventures. 



The newly sophisticated Jackson 
feels responsible for Ahmuls, and 
frets over what will happen to him 
once Susiem docks at the Associated 
Universities facilities. 

But a thousand years have gone by 
since Susiem*s last up-dating. She 
lands on a grassy plain, with nothing 
visible except an occasional distant 
white villa, and a smoothly pastoral 
landscape. She is immediately dis- 
assembled by self-propelled, mini- 
aturized units — some flying, like 
insects, and others burrowing, like 
insects — and her components are 
either carried away for salvage or 
buried in the ground, presumably to 
restore something of the organic bal- 
ance of nature. Ahmuls and Jackson 
are left standing there, Ahmuls 
naked and unashamed, Jackson 
dressed in captain*s coveralls and 
rather nonplussed, as the naked in- 
habitants of Earth approach.

H e was very heavy in the limbs. 

wasn’t slumped like Ahmuls, 
but he was very heavy in the limbs. 
And Ahmuls was right — they didn’t 
have any clothes on. 

They were a bunch of men and 
women, about thirty of them alto- 
gether. The first one of them — a 
man, with long, clean limbs, and 
much more smoothly and heavily 
muscled than anyone Jackson had 
ever actually seen — gracefully 
walked up into sight from a hidden 
hollow nearby and stood in ankle- 
deep grass, looking at the two of 
them. Then he half turned, and mo- 
tioned behind him, and the rest of 



130 



IF 




them came up. They were all adults, 
and they moved with a kind of con- 
fidence that reminded him of Amsirs. 
They had apparently been doing 
something together down in that hol- 
low, out of sight, and that was how 
they had managed to surprise him. 
For the nearest villa was much too 
far away for anyone from there to 
have made it this far in the little 
space of time since Susiem had land- 
ed, died and been buried. 

He felt heavy, and he felt sur- 
prised. 

Looking at them, he knew some- 
thing of what they were. They were 
people who had eaten right all their 
lives; lived right, had the right kind 
of doctoring. They were the people 
sprung from the kind of person he 
himself had been when he “was” at 
Ohio State. One of the things he had 
learned from “being” at Ohio State 
was that bio-transmitted memories 
were convincing, reliable and in some 
ways utterly irrelevant. 

He even knew how to look at him- 
self. He was undersized, too gang- 
ling, too long of leg, too hollow of 
stomach. His skin was like seamed 
leather; his eyes were pits, icy blue 
without a trace of melanin, their 
whites as white as smooth, wet bone. 
His hair was a short, raggedly cut 
thatch of brittle straw. In his bor- 
rowed coveralls, he was a parody. 

Their men were too big; their 
women were too smart. They came 
walking in toward him and Ahmuls 
as if none of them had ever stepped 
on a cockleburr. 

Well, what was he going to do? 
He couldn’t even rip off the cover- 
alls and be himself. For one thing. 



it would be completely gauche, to 
realize so late that he had landed 
here in a cyberneticized, landscaped 
paradise; in a world a thousand years 
younger than he was even when he 
was young enough to worry about 
being gauche, and educated enough 
to know what being gauche felt like. 
“See? Told you — no clothes.” 
“Right. My apologies, Ahmuls.” 
“Your what?” 

“I mean I’m sorry.” 

The buzzing of the insects had 
stopped. Now he could hear the mur- 
mur of the soft wind through the 
pliant grass and take time to feel 
the warmth of the wonderful sun on 
his face and hands. He could even 
remember what it had been like 
strolling along the shade-dappled 
groves of State, and the slumberous 
delight of baking for hours in the 
sun of Jackson Park beach when he 
was at Chicago. I’m home, he 
thought, I’m home where I’ve never 
been, and I have to state my claim 
to it. 

As he began to feel the onset of 
oncoming voices, their murmuring 
as the people spoke between them- 
selves, he shook his head to clear it, 
feeling the knots growing in the 
muscles of his neck. 

They had reached him. Some of 
them were raising itheir hands in 
casual greeting, and smiting. They 
were all taller than he was. One of 
the men said: “Hello, there. Comp 
tells us you’re from that genetic ex- 
periment on Mars, both of you. Tell 
you the truth, the Comp had never 
told us about the experiment before. 
There was a great range of new data 
when that spaceship came down with 



THE IRON THORN 



131 




you and prompted us to ask about 
it. Biggest thing in years. It’s great. 
Welcome.” 

Their accent was a bit far from 
the Midwest he knew. But it wasn’t 
unintelligible. He could could al- 
ready feel himself sorting it out prop- 
erly. 

C omp would be Central Control; 

the thing that guided the in- 
sects, that determined the fate of 
spaceships, of specimens from the 
genetic experiment on Mars, of the 
landscape which no longer needed 
more than a minimum of service- 
able features. It had happened here, 
some time after Susiem left. They 
had gotten their machines properly 
centralized under one control, and 
here he was, among the people it 
serviced. But I’m one of you, he 
thought. My body wasn’t born among 
you, but my mind was. 

“I’m glad to meet you,” he said 
honestly. “This is Ahmuls, and 
I’m — ” A wicked little relay closed 
inside his mind. He grinned. “I’m 
Jackson Greystroke. I was raised by 
jungle beasts.” 

He had said the right thing. They 
were all smiling. Two of the girls 
pursed their lips like ripe plums. 

“Marvelous!” the man said. 
“Come and have breakfast with us,” 
he said. “My name is — ah, Kringle. 
These aire my sons; Dasher, Comet 
and Cupid. My daughters. Dancer 
and Vixen. My other sons; Donder, 
Blitzen, and Prancer. I’ll let these 
other people tell you who they are 
— I wouldn’t presume to. At any 
rate, come on, let’s all grab a bite, 
and we can talk.” 



It was amazing, being with peo- 
ple who could pick up like that. 
“Come on, Ahmuls,” Jackson said, 
feeling better and better, lofted on 
a cloud of names as the remainder 
of these people made introductions 
for themselves — Cincinnatus, Co- 
lumbus and Elyria — Perry, Clark, 
Lois and Jimmy — Fred and Gin- 
ger — Lucky, Chester, Sweet, Home 
and Piedmont (who was glanced at 
with some disappointment by some 
of the others when she gave her 
name) — Batten, Barton, Durstine 
and Osborne. He found that he got 
them all straight, and kept them all 
straight. They all fit. Even when 
Piedmont said, shamefacedly: “I 

goofed. I should be Pall.” 

“I’m hungry,” one of them said 
from the back of the group. 

“We’re ready,” Jackson smiled. 
“And thank you for the invitation. 
Let’s go,” he said again to Ahmuls. 

“Don’t want to eat with you,” 
Ahmuls said. “Don’t want to eat with 
these people.” 

Jackson felt the tiniest flutter of 
air. A voice spoke in his ear. Out 
of the corner of his eye he caught 
a glimpse of something bright, metal 
and hovering. “This is Comp,” the 
voice said. “He needn’t worry. 
There’ll be food of his kind too.” 
Ahmuls said: “What did it say?” 
“He said he loves you. Come on.” 
Some of them were already begin- 
ning to walk away, back toward the 
hidden hollow. Jackson took a step 
to follow them, stopped, frowned at 
Ahmuls, turned his head back to 
watch them go, looked back at 
Ahmuls. “Come on!” He moved his 
hand quickly, and it felt heavy. 



132 



IF 




Ahmuls’ eyes daried to follow his 
hand. “Don’t.” He got himself into 
motion, one hand to the right side 
of his face, holding his eyelid so he 
could watch Jackson from the farth- 
est corner. 

The group of them walked over 
the grassy rise of ground. Durstine 
murmured, her perfume very near 
to Jackson: “I wish I’d brought some 
clothes.” Jackson stopped looking at 
Ahmuls and grinned at her. She 
raised one eyebrow back, touched 
her glistening upper lip with the tip 
of her tongue, and laughed. 

XXIII 

I t was a fine morning. Their break- 
fast things were set down in the 
grass, on a cloth — doubtless woven 
on the spot by bees — and the grace- 
ful cups and dishes were of earth 
colors, delicately shaped. Shaped de- 
licately enough, it occurred to him, 
to be attractive not only to man but 
to insect as well. He breakfasted on 
tamales, Riesling and conversation^ 
while Comp’s bees brought Ahmuls 
lichen. They made no dishes for 
him. Either Comp felt that Ahmuls’s 
hands would break chunks from any 
utensils the bees might make, or 
Comp was disinclined to produce 
anything clumsy enough to be sturdy 
enough. 

Jackson’s senses were much oc- 
cupied with the vivacious scent of 
women, with the sound of words 
sung, not grunted or cawed, with a 
sky of perfect blue. Thornless. If he 
watched Ahmuls, it was infrequently 
and from the corner of his eye. 

“So it’s really not much different 



from the way you remember it,” 
Kringle was saying. “I imagine 
you’ve got the picture. Comp reach- 
ed the serviceability threshold short- 
ly after the Martian experiment was 
started. And at that point it became 
unnecessary for people to concern 
themselves with management. 

“But we still have the same old 
services; food, clothing — or the 
control of factors that normally 
make clothing necessary — and shel- 
ter. Well, in actual fact the distinc- 
tion between clothing and shelter has 
disappeared, with the distinction be- 
tween genial and hostile environment. 
But it’s really, about the same. 
There aren’t as many of us. Frank- 
ly I feel that a great deal of the pro- 
creative urge is actually a reflection 
of panic or boredom. We have very 
little of either. So that’s all to the 
good. And, well, it’s a ball. As I’ve 
said, welcome!” 

He was so self-possessed, so ob- 
viously independent of anything 
what used to be called “the world” 
could do to him, that Jackson could 
really, strongly, feel how fortunate 
it had been that he had found a 
way to communicate immediately 
with this sort of person. 

Jackson thought — with all his 
customary speed — that all the same 
instincts that had made him such a 
fast and agile killer, such a self- 
fK>ssessed hunter, so obviously not 
one of the ordinary run around the 
Thorn, still served him in this new 
world. It was marvelous — not fag- 
goty marvelous; it was, truly, a mar- 
vel, and of marvels, and replete with 
marvels (how quickly his mind re- 
sponded to the stimuli of education!) 



THE IRON THORN 



133 




— that all his life, no matter where 
he had been, or what he had been 
doing, he had possessed the qualities 
necessary to be able to sit here at 
breakfast with these superb people. 

He began to chuckle, watching 
Ahmuls with lichen in his mouth and 
bees darting at his face. My God, 
my God, Jackson thought, who 
would believe it? Where are the 
Amsirs, and where are all the peo- 
ple who believed in Ariwol? I made 
it. I made it by being me. I made 
it by not holding still when they 
wanted to make me stay; when they 
were afraid I’d prove what they were. 

And yet, in looking back, he 
couldn’t honestly say that he had 
ever told himself that there was 
something better. He had only never 
ceased to feel that there was some- 
thing terribly wrong. And he had 
never even tried to change them. 
He had only had the wit not to let 
them change him. 

What a great deal of wit that was I 
Pure instinct, pure sense of self had 
sav^ him from missing this reward 
of being here. 

He began to laugh even louder 
as it occurred to him what an in- 
credible, marvelous, wonderful thing 
he’d done. He was here by right. 
He was one of them. 

Watching him laugh, they smiled. 
Little Pall held out a cup of wine. 
Her large brown eyes were twinkling 
again, as they had no doubt always 
been intended to. “It is nice, isn’t 
it?” she said. “It must feel good.” 

It was beyond his wildest dreams. 
He sat on the grass with his knees 
drawn up, sipping wine and feeling 
the heavy familiar touch of Earth 



upon him. “So, as 1 understand it,” 
he said to Kringle, delightedly con- 
tinuing their conversation, listening 
to the concepts roll trippingly from 
his tongue, “there’s really no further 
need to take time in accumulating 
credit toward necessities. In that 
event, what do people do to fill the 
day’s time?” 

Kringle looked a little nonplussed. 
“That’s a factual question,” he com- 
plained. 

O ne of the tiny silver bees detach- 
ed itself from the swarm around 
Ahmuls, zipped over to Jackson and 
said: 

“This is Comp. The people you’re 
with are members of the most popu- 
lous class of individuals. That is to 
say, the naturalists. Naturalists prac- 
tice the living of pure life. This hu- 
man preoccupation is, of course, a 
new one, in the sense that there had 
never been individuals totally free 
of managerial concerns. As you can 
guess, this is the first type of in- 
dividual capable of disregarding his 
own true physical situation or the 
estate of his factual accumulation. 
Accordingly, these people have no 
thought and perform no action 
which is not straightforwardly de- 
rived from the impulses of the 
psyche. 

“Since psychical development is 
conditioned by stimulus, and all 
stimuli to this class of individual are 
autistic, there is reason to believe 
that the minds of this class are quali- 
tatively different from any mind pre- 
viously attainable by the physical in- 
teractions of the human brain. So 
at some finite point in time this class

of individual will represent a human- 
oid, but non-human, true4>reeding 
race native to this planet. We will 
then see the phenomenon of a new 
genus created entirely by mechanical 
manipulation of the environment — 
that is to say, by the exercise of 
my facilities. 

“In other words, we’re talking 
pure Lamarck. I find the entire con- 
cept fascinating. 

“The second major but far less 
populous class is composed of in- 
dividuals who are to a large extent 
concerned with me. That is to say, 
the technophiliac type, who normal- 
ly cling somewhat closer to home — 
that is, to a conservative pattern of 
movement about the face of the 
Earth — and with whom I maintain 
close liaison. These receive a run- 
ning thorough education in all 
branches of technology and neuro- 
physiology bearing on my construc- 
tion, operation and maintenance. 

“The principle here is that indi- 
vidual intelligences are theoretically 
open to flash error. That is to say, 
considering the speed of neurophy- 
siological interaction, and the com- 
plexity of the structures involved, it 
is possible for a brain to be 
thoroughly sane at any given point 
of time, to have then made one mi- 
nor error a millisecond beyond that 
point, and to have then reached a 
point of extrapolative total error — 
that is, insanity — within a matter 
of microseconds subsequent to the 
initial point. 

“Therefore, it is of advantage to 
me to maintain a pool of individual 
intelligences with whom I can main- 
tain meaningful intercommunication. 



44’I^rom my point of view, the 

JO purpose of supporting such a 
class of individuals is the availability 
of an emergency correction and re- 
pair device independent of my own 
neurophysiological system. 

“From the point of view of the 
individuals concerned, the value lies 
in giving them something to tMuk 
about, and an eventuality to plan for. 

“The odds against an error on my 
part involving not only my primary 
systems but my backups, and my re- 
pair and auto-psychiatric circuitry, 
are astronomical. That is, they are 
finite, but rather large. Not once, 
since my primary circuits crossed the 
threshold into complete managerial 
awareness, has there been any need 
for any intelligence other than my 
own to supervise my intelligence and 
capabilities. Nevertheless, at some 
point during a finite though large 
number of years, such a need — 
theoretically — will arise. I say, 
‘theoretically.’ In any event, it’s a 
great comfort to both parties in this 
arrangement. 

“There are a number of other 
categories, but they are all essential- 
ly similar. They are the category of 
individuals who have institutional- 
ized various aspects of creativity. 
For example, sports and the arts. 
The chairman of the Toxophilite So- 
ciety is currently working on the 
fourteenth volume of his compen- 
dium on the subject. He has furnish- 
ed me, each month, with the latest 
updating of the rules for performing 
various evolutions of the limbs and 
torso required to flight an arrow at 
approved targets in regulation style. 
It keeps him happy, so why should 



THE IRON THORN 



135 




I care? And he has a great number 
of assistants and fans who are also 
kept happy. 

“That’s essentially the picture. 
Nobody ever gets hurt, statistically 
speaking. And there’s no problem 
to repairing an occasional accident 
to either the body or the mind of 
any individual. Personally I find it 
all rather fascinating. And I’m sure 
that you, with your relatively naive 
viewpoint, will find it the same. 

“I think you might as well forget 
about asking broad-spectrum ques- 
tions of any individual in this group, 
or in their class, because they rather 
expect me to handle that sort of 
thing. If you persist, you might even 
be considered gauche. I realize it’s 
hard not to occasionally appear 
gauche in unfamiliar company. You 
can avoid that, if you’d like. I can 
have a thorough education delivered 
to you, more or less the same way 
as the academic credits Susiem gave 
you. Just say the word. But, if I 
were you, I’d first wait a while, and 
explore around a bit. You might not 
care to be thoroughly indoctrinated 
in any one set of mores so soon. 
You’ve only been here an hour or 
so; there’s plenty of time left to de- 
cide which way you really want to 
swing. Meanwhile, just play it cool, 
and have a ball.” 

XXIV 

W ell, all right. It would be very 
interesting, living the rest of 
his life with a gimmick that would 
murmur softly in his ear whenever 
he wanted a question answered, or 
confer another degree upon him 



whenever he wished to master a sub- 
ject. 

He noticed that these people seem- 
ed to have no problems in dealing 
with social situations this could 
create. They had simply ignored him 
politely while he sat hstening to 
Comp, and had turned their attention 
to watching Ahmuls instead. 

Ahmuls was fidgeting, and swat- 
ting at the flying things around him. 
“No,” he said. “I don’t wanna eat 
this way. Fly away.” Comp’s ex- 
teroaffectors danced out of his way. 
Comp said to Jackson: 

“Is there anything you can do to 
make your friend less of a social li- 
ability to himself?” 

‘^I can’t even get him to like me.” 
Ahmuls caught a bee. Durstine 
gasped: “He’s so fast!” 

Ahmuls rolled the silvery exteroaf- 
fector between his fingertips. He 
grinned, one-handed. “Hard,” he 
said, “but little.” He flipped the bee 
to one side. He grunted at the break- 
fasters. “This is a crumby place. 
You don’t fly, you don’t fight. You 
got fliers, but they’re little. You 
don’t eat like you should.” He got to 
his feet, pushing land straining, 
drooping. The insects still hovered 
around his face. When he was stand- 
ing erect, Ahmuls was able to swat 
at them again. Durstine began to 
giggle. 

“It’s not funny. Knew I shouldn’t 
come here with you crazy people,” 
Ahmuls said. “I’m goin’ away; gonna 
find a better place.” He turned, 
rippling turgidly, and began to move 
off. 

Kringle smiled. “I wonder where 
he’ll find it.” 



136 



IF 




There was nothing out there but 
grass and white Walt Disney houses 
and exteroaffectors. “Heyl Wait! 
Hold on!” Jackson said, standing 
up. “Don’t just go out there like 
that!” 

Ahmuls turned his head, holding 
his face. “What’s it to you? Never 
gonna bother you. Just gonna go 
away, look around.” 

Where was he ever going to find 
a place that was going to love him? 
Jackson took a couple of fast steps 
and caught up with him. He put his 
hand on the doughy shoulder. “Oh, 
now — just wait,” he found him- 
self pleading. “Look, we just got 
here. You got to give it a chance. 
You’ve got to give yourself a 
chance. I mean, these people are 
happy this way. And I’m going to be 
happy here. You could — ” 

“I’m not like you. I’m not like 
them.” 

“Say .... Man to man on the 
prairie’s endless waste, the sinewy 
Jackson Greystoke and his mons- 
trous adversary faced each other,” 
Chester remarked behind him. 

Durstine chimed in: “The battle 
of two superb, physical machines 
trembled on the brink of being join- 
ed. Here in this peaceful glade that 
had seen no violence in a decade of 
centuries, suddenly there was a re- 
awakening of Earth’s age-old heri- 
tage of struggle between brute 
strength and trained intelligence.” 
Donder declaimed: “A still hush 
settled over the land, as Nature her- 
self seemed to draw breath in antici- 
pation of the awful onslaught.” 
“What? What are they talkin’ 
about?” Ahmuls muttered. 



J ackson looked over his shoulder. 

Kringle, Durstine and some of 
the others were staring toward him 
and Ahmuls, laughing-eyed. Some 
of the others were just plain eat- 
ing, gracefully sipping and nibbling. 
All of them were lounging about, re- 
laxed. Pall seemed a little interested. 
But people with large, moist eyes 
frequently seem emotional when in 
fact they are merely displaying a 
phenomenon of physiology. “Never 
mind,” Jackson sighed. “You just 
go on and do what you want.” 
Ahmuls said: “Should have said 
that to start with.” He trudged up 
the slope of the hollow, was sil- 
houetted massively against the pale 
horizon of late morning, and began 
to diminish from the legs up as he 
lumbered down the other side of the 
slope and out of Jackson’s line of 
vision. 

“Comp,” Jackson said, “you’ll be 
keeping track of 'him, right?” 

“Oh, I always know where every- 
body is, of course,” Comp said. “And 
I rather think I can predict where 
he’jll end up. Just as well. I can 
have permanent feeding facilities for 
him there, and I expect he’ll be hap- 
py. It’s a little tricky with an uneduc- 
able, as I imagine you know. But it’s 
rather exciting for me, having what 
you might call a random factor to 
deal with.” 

“Well, he’s not educable in hu- 
man terms. But you’re not limited 
to Susiem’s resources. Surely there’s 
something you can do for him be- 
yond simple maintenance,” Jackson 
said. He walked back toward the 
breakfast group. 

“Don't see the need,” Comp said. 



138 



IF 




“He has no history, and no future. 
All his yearnings are self-contained. 
He needs no further education on 
that.” 

Comp knew when a point was 
made. The bee flew away from be- 
side Jackson’s ear. 

“Looks like your faithful compan- 
ion has left you, Masked Rider of 
the Plains,” Kringle remarked as 
Jackson sat down again. 

“The only person he was ever 
faithful to is back on Mars,” Jack- 
son said. “That’s if they haven’t 
put somebody over him for the way 
he mishandled me.” In the midst of 
all this, Jackson did wonder how 
the Amsir Eld was making out. 

“Well,” Durstine said, “neither of 
you ever has to worry about that 
place again.” 

“I suppose not,” Jackson said. 
Her hand was petal-soft where her 
fingertips touched his as she passed 
him a tamale. Tamales were clad 
in pastry a lot like rough bread. 
Around the Thom, though, when a 
woman gave a Honor rough bread, 
she gave him rough fingers too. 

XXV 

A t the end of breakfast they stood 
up and left everything for Comp 
to clear away. Little silvery things 
came out of the grass, nibbled 
swarmingly, and the cloth, the dish- 
es and the leavings disappeared, bit 
by bit, lightning fast, into the earth 
from which they were sprung. 

Jackson grinned watching it, en- 
joying it. “Handy,” he said. Durs- 
tine followed his glance. 

“Oh, the services, you mean. Yes.” 



“Well,” Jackson said, looking 
around. “Whait do we do now?” 

“Actually,” Rringle said, “that de- 
pends pretty much on you. What 
would you iUke to do?” 

Fall said to Jackson: “I think 
we’ve been hoping you’d tell us a 
little bit about what your life was 
like.” 

Durstine smiled. “Among the 
jungle beasts.” 

“Well, I imagine Comp’s told you 
how it all began. There was a period 
of time when it seemed like a good 
idea to produce gentically modified 
humans capable of living comfortably 
in hostile environments. A site was 
prepared on Mars, and a program 
of genetic manipulation was begun. 
The initial modified type, miscalled 
the ‘Marser,* was created capable of 
surviving imaided on the Martian 
surface for extended periods of time, 
provided it had a base genial environ- 
ment to which it could return per- 
iodically. This completed Stage One 
of the program. 

“Stage Two would have either pro- 
duced a true Marser capable of full- 
time survival in the natural environ- 
ment, or alternatively the Stage One 
type would have been given the 
technological capability of trans- 
forming the environment to the re- 
latively slight degree required for 
its survival. 

“The crucial question was a politi- 
cal one. That is, whether the bio- 
formed inhabitants of Mars should 
retain a psychic dependence on Earth 
and its history, or whether they 
should be made truly independent. 
The point being, they couldn’t be 
made truly independent of the en- 



THE IRON THORN 



139 




vironment without also being truly 
independent of the universities which 
had put them there. 

“Well, there was considerable dis- 
cussion back and forth about that, 
and a little trouble about getting 
next year’s grant from the National 
Institute of Health. There was a cut- 
back in the program. The human 
technicians on the site were told to 
establish a semipermanent base for 
themselves while the whole thing was 
being thrashed out. And so there 
came to be two adjacent Thorns.” 

“We know all that,” Bonder said 
with restraint. “Comp told us. The 
whole thing became academic any- 
how, when Comp took over the serv- 
ices. You’ve got two equally intelli- 
gent races with essentially equal 
facilities, competing with each otiier 
in an uncontaminated environment. 
Clear-cut, educational. Like an ant 
farm. Comp explained it. All sorts 
of daita bound to result from it, for 
anybody who wants experimental 
data on social evolutionary factors. 
But, man, we don’t want to hear 
any of that dry stuff. I mean, what 
was it like? What’s this buiness about 
killing off what-is-it-you-call-them 
— Amsirs? I mean, what kind of 
hunting is that?” 

“Yes,” Durstine said, “show us!” 

Mmm, Jackson thought, looking 
at her, she’d like that. “Well,” he 
said, “I’m a little short of the neces- 
sary tools.” He held up his empty 
hands. “A little sihort of Amsirs, 
too.” 

A voice said in his ear, “This is 
Comp. I can arrange that. Listen, 
I’d love to make a popular actuality 
of this.” 



“A what?” 

“An actuality. It’s no problem; I 
could make an Amsir for you — 
excuse me; a Amsir — and a throw- 
ing stick and a couple of darts. I 
have some very good footage of the 
Martian terrain from my orbiters up 
there.” 

“Orbiters? You mean you’ve got 
eyes on Mars?” 

“Certainly. Quite a number. Our 
space exploration’s quite sophisti- 
cated these days, compared to what 
it was when the primary system com- 
ponent was humanoid. But what I’m 
saying is that I have plenty of stock 
background, so you go ahead and 
hunt your Amsir. And the audience 
will see it with proper background 
and lighting. And perfect dubbing of 
the terrain. I am sure we can get 
you one hell of an audience for it. 
Wait one — I’ll ask around.” 

6^/^reat response,” Comp said to 

Vj him a moment later. “We 
have over four hundred thousand 
lookers-in; thirty-eight per cent of 
the potential audience.” 

“I don’t think I understand. 
Thirty-eight per cent of the audience 
for what?” 

“The audience for your actuality, 
man. Look, the number of the au- 
dience and the number of the world 
population are theoretically congru- 
ent, right? In practice there are al- 
ways some individuals asleep and 
some urgently occupied otherwise. 
So there’s never been a hundred per 
cent audience for an actuality — 
not the live version, at any rate. The 
record is eighty-three per cent or 
thereabouts, but that was for the 



140 



IF 




competition between Melanie Alter- 
shot and Charles Dawn, and a very 
long time ago. Well, I queried the 
population for interest in a Amsir 
hon, and they’re all waiting — 
thirty-eight per cent of them are 
waiting now, and a number of others 
have expressed serious interest in 
taking on the delay. It hinges now 
on whether you’re willing. But I 
think you should know there hasn’t 
been a thirty-eight per cent audience 
in quite some time.” 

“You know, we don’t have all 
day,” Donder said. 

“Well, I’d like to do it,” Jackson 
said. “Right here, huh?” Besides the 
impatience on Bonder’s voice, he had 
also noticed Vixen and Batten. The 
two of them now had some kind of 
flying toy they’d had Comp do for 
them. 

It was elfin; translucent lavender. 
It caracolled back and forth between 
them as they stood some distance 
apart from each other and flew it 
from hand to hand. The object seem- 
ed to be to make a pattern, for the 
marvelous toy trailed a feathery 
lavender wake which hung in the air 
briefly and then disintegrated into 
dusty filaments, crossing, criss-cross- 
ing and intertwining. 

They had begun this game while 
Comp was explaining actualities and 
Jackson was busy listening. One or 
two people in the group had stopped 
watching Jackson and had started 
watching the flight; from being a 
tight group around Jackson, these 
people had begun to spread toward 
Batten and Vixen, attenuating. 
“Sure,” Jackson repeated. “Provide 
me with the tools and a Amsir.” 



“Goodl” Durstine and Comp said 
simultaneously. Pall smiled. Jackson 
smiled back at her. “I know what 
it is,” she said. “You never realized 
you’d get a chance here to do some- 
thing you must have enjoyed so 
much.” 

“Pall, darling,” Old said, “one of 
the reasons I want to watch this is 
because it’s done in a place where 
people do things they don’t enjoy.” 
Pall put her fingers to her mouth. 
“Oh, Jackson, I’m sorry,” she said. 

XXVI 

I n this world, Amsir bones were 
made by insects. They came 
whipping in over the tops of the 
sougWng grass stems, in a swarm 
far smaller than the one that had 
devoted itself to Susiem, each carry- 
ing a little white speck. They buzzed, 
they grouped to some efficient shape, 
and in a thrice there was the stick. 
The place that would serve as the 
handle was properly reshaped as if 
by patient sanding; the hinge was 
neatly fitted, the nock for the dart’s 
butt properly incised. Jackson pick- 
ed it up and admired it. 

“It’s very much like my own. 
Comp. Those are good scanners 
you’ve got.” 

“How about the darts?” 

The short, bluntly tapered hafts 
had been produced the same way 
the throwing stick had been. The 
head was done by burrowing extero- 
ceptors, who came spilling up out 
of the ground, clustered at the head 
of each dart as bees held it in place, 
and withdrew leaving cooling, jagged- 
ly pointed silicate heads fus^ into 



THE IRON THORN 



141 





the cups that had been made there 
to receive them — each, for all Jack- 
son knew, already freighted with its 
dab of synthetic Amslr-hide glue. He 
picked them up and bounced them 
in his palm. He rolled them around 
with his fingers. “Good,” he said. 
“Good, fine.” 

He walked up the slope of the 
hollow and looked around. The 
landscape rolled away from him, 
empty. There was no sign of Ahmuls, 
or of anyone else. But there were a 
great many receptor bees clustering 
in the air up there. 

“Look to your left,” Comp said. 
“I am starting your Amsir.” 

About seventy-five yards away the 
exteroaffectors attacked the grass. 
They darted down to catch stems 
being hurled up- to them by cutters 
on the ground. They seized them 
and pulled them up into position. 
They moved with great rapidity, 
dexterity, and econofny — it was as 
if the grass had freed itself of com- 
pliance to the breeze and had de- 
cided to bend its own way. It bent 
in all directions toward a common 
center as the exteroaffectors took it, 
but as it bent it hurried forward 
rootless, and when it reached the 
center it fountained up, urged by 
splashes of buzzing silver, and there 
before Jackson’s eyes they wove a 
Amsir’s bones. 

Toe and tarsal, leg and knee, thigh 
and hip, they wove him from the 
inside out; spine, collarbone, shoul- 
der joints, arms, elbows, forearms, 
hands — he watched the little finger 
extend itself like the sihootings of 
a magic shrub. Neck and skull 
matted themselves into structural

IF 





oompactness. Now, flesh; fibrous 
strands wrested into place upon the 
green bones. In a moment, he was 
all hooked up together. Then they 
clad him; hide was fitted, bubbles 
swelled. Beak and talons, crest and 
wings; lace, fluttering . fluttering 
pale; as he stirred there, with ex- 
teroaffectors burrowing nimbly be- 
tween the fibers to give him life, he 
bleached. 

An army of burrowers came run- 
ning forward, and fused the glisten- 
ing fragments of his javelin. They 
tossed it upward; a low cast, but his 
wing rippled as his right hand swoop- 
ed down to seize it, and hollow- 
eyed he straightened to turn his head 
and look at Jackson. 

“Comp, your name is miracle,” 
Jackson said. 

“My name is Comp.” 

Jackson opened down the Velcro 
of his coveralls and shrugged out of 
them. Immediately, exteroaffectors 
clustered around him. He winced as 
they plated his body everywhere with 
themselves. But the touch was gentle, 
and they were gone again in the 
blink of an eye. “Sunburn lotion,” 
Comp explained. 

“Oh. Yeah, makes sense.” 

He looked around to see what 
the breakfast group had made of 
all this. But there were none of them 
near him. They were all down in the 
hollow, sitting dr stretched out grace- 
fully, each with an exteroaffector on 
each eye, at each ear, on each hand. 
A little string of them, like a girdle 
of small jewels, lay across each 
stomach just below the navel. Jack- 
son look^ over at the grass Amsir 
standing alert in the middle of his 



patch of stubble. Jackson bent down, 
picked up the throwing stick and the 
two darts. The coveralls were gone, 
dissipated. 

“Ready any time you are, friend,” 
he called to the Amsir. 

“Ready,” Comp said in his ear, 
and withdrew. 

T he Amsir waved its javelincd 
hand to him. Jackson took a 
few quick steps; running on grass 
was different, but he remembered. 
Remembering it gave him Ohio feet 
instead of Thorn feet, but at least 
it gave him feet. He tried a few dry 
casts of the stick, slapped the spare 
dart up into him armpit and was 
off. 

He was playing it about the only 
way he could; as if he and the Amsir 
had each turned a shoulder of a dune 
at the same moment and had spotted 
each other at a distance. He ran 
away at an angle, down and across 
the slope of the land, picking up 
speed, ready to dive and roll straight 
downhill if the bird cast its javelin. 

The Amsir was turning. A thou- 
sand or ten thousand exteroaffectors 
shifted its weight, raised its arms, 
cocked its hips, raised its leg. It 
tipped forward, planted its leg, raised 
the other, and was running like the 
wind, lace streaming, wings unfurled. 
It ran down and across the slope of 
the land, diagonally away from him, 
cutting back across his line of flight, 
putting him in a position where he’d 
have to throw in the direction op- 
posite to the one he was running in. 

Damn! Jackson thought. I forgot 
how smart they were. He looked 
back over his shoulder. The dark. 



THE IRON THORN 



143 




wide, empty eyes were looking along 
a wing at him. Jackson got his legs 
out in front of him and set his feet. 
He was sliding to a stop. The Am- 
sir grinned, spread his wings and 
hung stock-still in the air, legs free 
of the ground. His knees bent; one 
wing dropped, the other rose. He 
landed faced round on a dime, claws 
sunk in the tough grass, javelin pois- 
ed. His leps began to scissor. He 
came on ' an ostrich, straight for 
Jackson, eaung up distance between 
them, confident he could duck. 

For Jackson to get up any mo- 
menitum to reach the Amsir with a 
dart, he would have to run straight 
toward him, now. If he ran to either 
side, the Amsir would have a clear 
shot. And the best Jackson could 
do would be to try something side- 
arm. If he ran away, the Amsir would 
run him down. 

Oh boy, Jackson thought. All 
right, let’s try one on you. He took 
three steps forward, simultaneously 
loading the stick, and then with the 
fourth step he fired. 

Jesus, there was nothing on the 
throw. It was straight enough, but 
there was no whip to it; it was like 
throwing straight up. Or throwing 
with a sick arm. 

Fm made of gruel in this place! 
he thought. The dart might reach 
the Amsir, but he was a fool if he 
bothered to break stride long enough 
to duck. It would never get through 
his hide. It would hang tangled in 
his lace. Even if it happened to stick 
into him a little, it would have no 
stopping power. 

TTie dart reached the Amsir, who 
swayed clumsily to get out of its way. 



But he’d miscalculated. He ran right 
up on it. It took him in the chest, 
on the lower left, and it just seemed 
to keep going in past all reason. It 
went in up to the butt, with the 
sound of shocked fibers. The Amsir’s 
legs went out from under him. He 
spread his wings for balance, drop- 
ping the javelin. 

“The dart. Give him the other 
dart!” Comp said quickly in Jack- 
son’s ear. 

“Right.” The Amsir was all 
spread out, and had no traction. 
Jackson fired the second one, and this 
time he had enough practice to real- 
ly step into it. He could feel it all 
up and down his arm and across his 
back, clear down to the sole of his 
foot, like a rope of electricity. He 
threw that dart harder than he had 
ever thrown in his life, and to re- 
ward him it took off feeling about 
half as good as it should have. But 
it got to the grass Amsir all right; 
it went in below his right collarbone, 
and it came out the other side, carry- 
ing about two or three yards beyond 
him, tumbling, looping down and 
bouncing on the ground, with a trail 
of tom grass floating out in the air 
behind it. The Amsir’s right wing 
folded back as if the hinge locks had 
failed on a carrier-based aircraft. He 
ground-looped around the surface of 
his left wing and nosedived heavily 
to the prairie. You could hear his 
neck pop. 

“He’s dead,” Jackson said. 

Comp said, “Listen.” 

The sound was incomprehensible. 
It sounded like what you might hear 
if you ran as fast as you could, 
dragging a spear point-down through 



144 



IF 




rough sand. “What the hell is that?” 
“That’s applause, Jackson. That’s 
the applause of thirty-eight per cent 
of the world’s popidation. I’ve got 
the gain turned down, some.” 

XXVII 

J ackson walked over to the dead 
Amsir. It lay sprawled where he 
had dropped it, all broken, Jackson’s 
first dart just peeping out of its chest. 
There was a rustling and a shaking; 
it slumped, its tissues separating. 
The little metal insects came out 
of its fibers, and each took its little 
bit of dead grass away. Others came 
popping up to join them. The Am- 
sirs’s wings became insubstantial; its 
body flattened. Its skull uncurled, 
and quick as that the burrowing ex- 
teroaffectors were scurrying off with 
its components, a straw-and-metal 
wave, still roughly in the shape of 
a fallen Amsir’s silhouette, hurrying 
through the grass, back to the stubble 
patch, there to return its elements to 
the soil. A buzzing cluster chew 
through the javelin and the darts; 
Jackson dropped the throwing stick 
into the midst of them, and they 
snapped it up. 

The breakfast group came up over 
the crest from the hollow, their faces 
flushed, their eyes sparkling. Dancer 
broke into a sprint toward Jackson, 
and as soon as one of them had done 
it, the rest of them followed suit. 
They came springing up to him, 
lau^ng, delighted with him. Jack- 
son was watching the stubble patch. 
Where clear droplets of water were 
forpiing on the clipped stems. 

Kringle threw his arm around 



Jackson’s shoulders and hugged him. 
“Terrific!” he said. “Just great!” 
“You were fine!” Durstin gasped. 
“Unbelievable!” 

They crowded around him, their 
bodies warm. “Wouldn’t you like to 
see it?” Pall asked. 

“Yes! He ought to see it!” Jimmy 
agreed, and the rest of them took 
that up, smiling and laughing, press- 
ing some sort of feast upon him. 
Comp said: “Here — ” 
Exteroaffectors landed like butter- 
flies at his ears and eyes. They touch- 
ed his palms and his belly. 

“Ail that’s involved is my getting 
in phase with the appropriate sectors 
of your central nervous system,” 
Comp explained. “Just relax. Many 
people prefer to sit or lie down, but 
it’s not necessary.” 

They were all around him. Jack- 
son had never had that happen to 
him before; all of them were radiat- 
ing at least ninety-eight point six de- 
grees Fahrenheit. At that temper- 
ature, they were creating all kinds of 
ranges of evaporation at their bodily 
surfaces, and none of them were in- 
sulated, nor was he. All kinds of ef- 
fluents were being volatilized in close 
proximity to his olfactory receptors 
and the thermesthetic components of 
his own system. He sank down to 
the grass, hugging his knees. They 
sank down with him, all around him, 
smiling encouragingly and watching 
him. He closed his eyes. “That’s 
right,” Comp said. “Now here we 
go . .” 

T he desert faded in. First there 
was a long shot of the two cra- 
ters and the two Thoms, from a higji 



THE IRON THORN 



145 




altitude. The edge of the planet 
curved, nearly undiffused, against 
Star-filled space. Then his point of 
view transmitted into tighter and 
tighter focus on the human crater, 
until it was a tight shot of the desert 
at dawn, reddish-purple, rolled up 
into dunes, with the harsh light of 
morning upon it. 

The point of view pulled in even 
tighter, until all there was to see was 
a flat, featureless, uniformly granu- 
lar, unmarked field of desert-color. 
That point of view held for a beat; 
then an Amsir’s white claw flashed 
down into the middle of it, thrust 
with a thump in running stride across 
the granules, scattering them. It 
flashed up and forward, out of the 
point of view, and was gone, leav- 
ing everything as before except for 
the pit of its print, whose sides be- 
gan to crumble and flow. Light 
sparkled from one granule, and 
Jackson’s attention followed it as it 
slid down the side of the footprint. 
It had not touched bottom before, 
with a thump! -thump!, human run- 
ning feet crossed quickly from right 
to left, kicking the Amsir-print out 
of existence, leaving their own. 

The point of view shifted up, and 
he caught a glimpse of a running, 
naked Honor, and then, ahead of 
him, the bobbing form of an Amsir. 

There was a jump cut, and the 
Amsir was running toward the point 
of view, grinning straight ahead. 

Another jump, and now it was 
Jackson running by himself; for the 
first time, Jackson could be sure it 
was him and not a piece of stock 
footage, for he could see the scar 
on his shoulder, and then the profile 



of the uncapped face. His lips were 
drawn back. His teeth were white 
and wet; the point of view filled 
with the side of his face, squinting, 
then the eyes snapping wide open — 
every pore, and every delicate blond 
hair growing whitely at the tops of 
his cheekbones above the line of his 
beard. The cut this time was to a 
medium down shot of the two of 
them. Jackson was running, his head 
turned to look back over his shoul- 
der. There was a shot of his feet 
jamming to a halt in the sand, fight- 
ing for purchase. 

Now the Amsir, braking in mid- 
air, changing direction. 

Now, Jackson’s first shot. The 
dart slapped into place on the stick. 
There was a beautiful slow-motion 
study of the muscles working in 
time, taken from behind him as he 
made the recovery from his stop 
and worked the cast of his stick. His 
arm flowed the throwing stick up- 
ward, the dart in its nock, poised, 
head sparkling. The motion began 
to speed, until as the dart came into 
line with the Amsir and he snapped 
it free the motion went into over- 
speed. The muscles of his right arm 
and of his stomach twanged with 
force as he shot the dart, which 
whipped through the air and sank 
into the Amsir’s chest. It came in so 
fast that the bird didn’t even begin 
to duck until after he’d been hit. 

Now the Amsir hung in the air for 
a split second, in mortal trouble, 
wide open. The point of view jump- 
ed around Jackson like a carousel; 
he could see every move of his feet 
and legs, every twist of his torso, the 
tight strain of his left hand as he 



146 



IP 




whipped it down, the flow of his 
right arm. There was an extreme 
closeup of the second dart as 
it whipped hack across and below 
the horizon, then whipped forward 
again, as if the dart were motionless 
and the world were spinning. And 
then there was a medium long shot 
of the Amsir taking the second dart 
and breaking his wing — actually 
seen in extreme closeup, reflected in 
the dilated pupil and the bottomless 
iris of Jackson’s left eye. The back- 
ground music, which had built up 
and over the sound of Jackson’s 
forced breath with a crescendo of 
wood-block slaps, cut off. Jump cut 
to the Amsir’s head impacting on the 
sand, MEDIUM LONG SHOT over 
Jackson’s shoulder. SOUND: Neck 
breaks. (Hold long shot; DUB ex- 
treme close SOUND). 

There was a medium closeup, 
facing Jackson, of him standing 
there, the empty stick dangling in 
his hand, his shoulders slumped. He 
was wiping his face and taking a 
deep breath. Then the point of view 
pulled back and up; there was a long 
shot, still trucking back, of Jackson 
looking toward the Amsir lying all 
crumpled up on the terrain, dwind- 
ling as the shot pulled back far 
enough so that the planet’s horizon 
came back into view again. The 
camera panned to the stars, toward 
the Sun, became filled with hot white 
light, and then, on an accent clack 
from the wood blocks, cut out to 
APPLAUSE. 

T hey were all around him; he 
opened his eyes, and they were 
sitting there right on top of him, 



damn near, touching him, grinning, 
laughing, saying: “Didn’t we tell you! 
Great! Absolutely great 1” 

Kringle said: “I’d had no idea of 
how it was. It’s never really possible 
to reach an intellectual grasp of a 
totally alien environment. That’s why 
actualities are so superbly fitted to 
the didactic purpose. It’s all very 
well to be given a series of facts for 
the brain to digest, but when you 
want to convey the immediacy of a 
situation, you’ve got to hit ’em right 
in the guts. Only way to do it. And 
I don’t mind telling you. I’ve been 
hit.” 

Vixen said breathlessly: “I feel as 
if my entire life’s been changed.” 
She was hanging onto his arm. Well, 
people never believed a thing until 
they touched it. 

“Hey, Comp,” Jackson said, “why 
didn’t I understand that thing? Was 
that supposed to be a Amsir hon?” 

“I don’t — oh. Yes I do. You’re 
talking about the editing and the di- 
rection. I should have realized; yes, 
I imagine it does look quite different 
in the finished version from the way 
it feels to you while you’re perform- 
ing the action. But you have to re- 
alize that the way it feels to you is 
made up of experiences, whereas to 
them it’s made up of appearances. 
It would be dull as ditchwater if I 
were to simply present a running 
record of the action from a fixed 
point of view. No, in order to give 
these people the feeling of what it’s 
really like, considerable skill must be 
exercised in arranging the patterns 
of action in a way that will be mean- 
ingful to them. And it is meaningful; 
look at them reacting!” 



THE IRON THORN 



147 




“Full of tricked-up dub-ins, and 
shots jumping around like a nut?” 
“It’s what they need in order to 
be able to feel it. Believe me, a great 
deal of skill and intuition went into 
that production, and none of the 
effects were selected lightly. You 
want to remember, Jackson, that all 
you had to do was react naturally. 
Im the one who had to manage it 
from scratch.” 

“I suppose that includes the dumb 
way I was able to kill that fake in 
the first place.” 

“If you’re referring now to the 
Amsir’s dull reactions at the crucial 
moment, you want to bear in mind 
that your reflexes and capabilities 
aren’t yet coordinated with the physi- 
cal properties of this environment.” 
Comp chided him: “We couldn’t 
very well have the Amsir hon you 
to death, could we?” 

Jackson shook his head. The peo- 
ple were milling around excitedly, 
listening to exteroaffectors, getting 
all worked up about something new. 

“What are you telling them now, 
while you’re talking to me?” 

“Oh, there’s been a world-wide 
reaction to the actuality. I’m run- 
ning a great number of relays to in- 
dividuals who’ve been clued in by 
the live audience. Your total’s well 
over fifty per cent at this point, and 
accelerating. You’re getting great 
word-of-mouth on this piece.” 

Pall took his hands. Her eyes were 
shining. “Jackson, Jackson, do you 
know what we’re going to do?” 
“’Fnaid not.” He said it pretty 
geady. 

“We’re going to have an — oh, 
excuse mel — a honing party!” 



Jackson turned to Kringle: 
“You’re going to have a what?” 
Kringle’s eyes were twinkling. 
“Watch!” He waved his arm, and the 
babble of cross-exclamations that 
had burst out among the breakfast 
group fell away to a background 
murmur. “What do you say? Shall 
we have a Thorn?” 

*^Yesr 

“Comp . .” Kringle said. 

Oh, the sweet, passionate smell of 
them! 

A dozen buzzings trembled faintly 
all around the horizon. Jackson 
turned to look. There were shimmer- 
ings around the low white houses, 
under the trees. The trees themselves 
were glinting, and then trees and 
houses had disappeared in a silver 
mist, and the air shivered with the 
sound of flying. Jackson kept turn- 
ing, watching. Kringle chuckled. 

The grass quivered everywhere, as 
if someone hidden under a bed had 
reached up and begun to pull on the 
blanket. 

“I’m going to have to move you 
for a few minutes,” Comp said. “If 
you’ll just step on board . .’. .” 
Durstine tugged on his hand. 
''This way.” 

Not all of Comp’s exteroaffectors 
in this area were devoting themselves 
to the trees and the white houses. Be- 
hind Jackson’s back, some of them 
had* put together a webwork of 
metal, its struts and stanchions curv- 
ing and curlicuing every which way, 
with hammocks and canopies ex- 
tended from it, tassels swaying en- 
ticingly, fountains sheeting crystalline 
auroras from pool to lower pool to 



148 



IF 




lower pool, step by step, to the ac- 
companiment of delicately chiming 
music. It all made an insouciantly 
variform cloud of nooks and cran- 
nies-within-crannies, yet open enough 
within itself so that the breakfast 
group’s members could call back and 
forth and laugh to each other as 
they clamored about within it. Dur- 
stine tugged him inside, and the 
cloud lifted away from the surface 
of the prairie, drifting off to one 
side as it gained altitude, until they 
were all perched a hundred yards up 
in the air, reclining, clambering, jok- 
ing back and forth, whispering 
excitedly. A pleasant breeze swept 
through the structure. Droplets from 
the fountains tickled Jackson oc- 
casionally. Pall’s upturned face peek- 
ed out from between two curling 
metal leaves farther down within. 
She wrinkled her nose at him and 
waved. 

Meanwhile, Comp was making a 
party Thorn. 

The cloud drifted languidly above 
roaring torrents of exteroaffectors. 
They swirled through the air, rush- 
ing in from all directions, converg- 
ing. Where they met, some swirled 
into subsidiary pools, other bloomed 
upward in flashing combers, with 
little flecks of a kind of spray flash- 
ing away from their tips as they de- 
livered their freight and went flitt- 
ing away for another load. The fab- 
ric of the cloud thrummed to the 
cataract sound; parts of it — leaves 
and flowers — began to chime in 
counterpoint to the fountain music. 

“Look! Look!” Durstine breathed, 
her upper arm across his shoulders 
from a little behind him, her forearm 



bent to lie down across his biceps. 
Her voice was in his ear. 

The exteroaffectors pulled away 
from the plain below. Only a conical, 
thick cluster of them, a hundred feet 
across, hung in the air above the 
plain, and then these unwound in 
a spiral from the bottom. As they 
unwound, Jackson could see that they 
were finishing the upper stretches 
of the Thorn. Down on the ground, 
in a gay, fluttering circle, pavilions, 
bountifully striped and decorated, 
circled around the Thorn between a 
turf running track and beautiful 
fields delimited by clipped green 
hedgerows. He looked again, and the 
Thorn was done; straight, tall, shim- 
mering, with flags in its antennas. 

“It’s gorgeous,” Jackson said. 

The cloud sank down to the turf 
between the Thorn and the pavilion 
houses, and everyone ran off to drink 
from the fountains. The fountains 
were spotted around its base, where 
he remembered taps. Pall was bent, 
hair falling about her cheeks in two 
short, sculptured wings, sipping from 
her cupped wet hands, where he re- 
membered Petra Jovans. 

XXVIII 

T he Thorn was warm, and gently 
yielding when he touched it. He 
couldn’t make up his mind what 
color it was; in some places it was 
off-black, with wine-dark highlights. 
As he shifted his gaze, he could see 
places where it was as green as a fly. 
He stood back, gawking like a tour- 
ist, his head going from side to side, 
admiring the way the flagged an- 
tenna raked against the pure blue 



THE IRON THORN

sky. He crossed his arms across his 
chest, oupping his elbows. 

“Oh, it’s going to be such a great 
time!” Pall exclaimed, running up 
wet-lipped. “Just everyone will be 
watching the actuality of it!” 

Jackson nodded. “I believe it.” 
Then he smiled, looking at her. What 
the hell — I mean, he thought, if 
she looked like a kid, you’d watch 
your mouth, wouldn’t you? He felt 
a touch on his arm. This Durstine, 
now .... 

“Let’s go inside,” she was saying. 
“Wouldn’t you like to look around 
in there?” 

“ ’Scuse us, Pall,” Jackson said. 

“Oh, that’s all right. I have to go 
change anyhow, and I want it to be 
a surprise!” She ducked off toward 
one of the pavilions. 

“I’ll be changing, too,” Durstine 
said. “But we have a moment.” 

He followed her into the Thorn 
through a wide, elaborate doorway, 
and it was like slipping into a sea of 
jewel soup. 

The Thorn was hollow inside, all 
the way to the top, but webbed by 
crystal filaments that spun them- 
selves glittering in swa)dng curtains 
and loops, on up to disappear in the 
soft shadows overhead. Through the 
translucent walls of the Thorn came 
light, and the walls of the Thorn 
were all colors; green and gold, red 
and violet, blue and rust. The colors 
swirled and swept about each other 
in a pattern different from the not- 
quite-random swirlings of the inner 
webwork, which took what it 
pleased of them and threw it back 
to Jackson and Dm*stine in a shower 
of shifting pinpoints. He looked at 



her, and she was mottled with glory. 

She laughed and tossed her head, 
then stood motionless, looking at 
him between the lashes at the comer 
of one eye. “Welcome to Earth,” 
she said. “I wanted you to see this.” 
She turned gracefully, on tiptoe, 
raising one arm in a gesture that 
swept around the interior of the 
Thorn. It was hard to tell whether 
she meant the Thorn, or herself, or 
both. “I’ll see you here again, a little 
later. I’m going to go change . 
you might not recognize me, gown- 
ed. Ordinarily. But you will this 
time, at least. I promise. I promise 
with all my heart.” She laughed 
gaily, secretively; her hand flashed 
out. Her fingernails trailed down his 
upper arm lightly enough, but by 
the time they reached his elbow 
they left a mark, and her middle 
finger drew a drop of blood. 

She touched it to her lips, kissed 
him on the mouth and walked 
away, looking back over her shoulder 
for a moment. 

I^cople were beginning to come in 
to the Thorn; bees were listen- 
ing to them, and exteroaffeotors 
were beginning to pelt about, mak- 
ing and bringing whatever was want- 
ed. There began to be music. 

Jackson noticed that they weren’t 
especially dressed. Oh, Elyria wore 
hoops of fine-spun wire around her 
neck, in a golden cascade, and Bon- 
der had on a pair of black horn- 
rimmed glasses with flat window- 
pane lenses. Lois had clad one arm 
in silvery chain mail to the shoul- 
der, and so forth. But it was the 
light that decorated them. As they 



150 



IF 




shifted back and forth, talking, ges- 
ticulating, beginning to warm up to 
the occasion, they gained and lost 
patterns that shifted over their skins. 
They weren’t eating or drinking, 
much. They were talking mostly. In 
fact, some of them were sitting very 
still, eyes half closed, heads bent, as 
if completely lost in private worlds. 
Often enough, one or another of 
them would smile at him, raise a 
hand, and look friendly and delight- 
ed to have him here. But none of 
them were really getting into conver- 
sation with him. They were much 
more interested in whatever it was 
that went on in their heads while 
they waited for a party to start swing- 
ing. 

It was Vixen who started the ball 
rolling. Standing a little off to one 
side, she’d have been frowning and 
swaying her body just slightly. Jack- 
son had been watching her curious- 
ly, while he stood around waiting 
to see what would happen when 
Durstine — and Pall, too — came 
in. He happened to be watching 
when she suddenly snapped her fin- 
gers and said delightedly: “Got it!” 

“What? What do you have?” Gin- 
ger asked, and as Vixen grinned, 
heads began to turn. 

Vixen took two or three steps 
forward, walking in a peculiar way. 
As she moved, she seemed to gain 
confidence; her movements became 
more pronounced and regular, and 
a little smile played around the 
corners of her mouth. She walked 
that way to the center of the circle 
made by the Thom’s floor. She had 
everybody’s attention, now, and the 
light began to change. A glow be- 



gan to come over the crystalline 
draperies, and soft, golden light be- 
gan to grow in a dome, starting at 
the Thorn’s floor, and working its 
way up the interior walls, until they 
were all standing in a crystal-clear 
bath of it. 

“Jackson! Jackson — look!” 

Vixen came walking toward him, 
one hand on her hip, the other ex- 
tended in a graceful arch over her 
head, palm flat, fingers up. She smil- 
ed at him and reached with the other 
hand, and lifted something imaginary 
from the top of her head. She bent 
slightly at the waist, holding out her 
hands. “Water, Honor?” 

The party burst into applause. 
Vixen smiled shyly, laughed a little, 
and retreated. Apparently, it had 
been intended to be some kind of 
pantomime. But that wasn’t how 
you carried water; you cradled water 
in your arms. 

“Well! That was a good beginning, 
wouldn’t you say?” Kringle said, 
slapping him on the back. “I’d say 
she really conveyed the idea, 
wouldn’t you?” He peered a little 
more closely at Jackson’s face. “No? 
Well, perhaps there were certain mi- 
nor crudities in her performance.” A 
little knot of Vixen’s particular 
friends was clustering around her, 
congratulating her. “But it was cer- 
tainly good enough for a beginning,” 
Kringle said. 

Donder stepped forward. He stood 
in the center of the floor, and raised 
his hand negligently. A hush fell 
over the crowd. Donder took a 
breath and began to speak: 

“D/e. 

Be borriy be loud, be running, but

die. Those of us born 

Thorn-children suck that in our 
milk. 

Hey, Thorn: 

We spit your word on you.** 

He bow^ to Jackson, flushed, a 
sheen of sweat across his brow. 

They started to applaud. Then 
one of them remembered something, 
and began to snap his fingers. The 
inside of the party Thorn crackled 
with the odd sound of it. 

“How ’bout that, Jackson?” Bon- 
der called out to him. “Sort of puts 
it all in a nutshell, doesn’t it?” 

Jackson asked Kringle: “Does he 
mean, the way people feel about the 
Thorn? I mean, does he feel that 
way about the thing that keeps him 
alive?” 

A very slight frown appeared be- 
tween Kiingle’s brows again. “I think 
if you examine your internal pro- 
cesses, you might find he came some- 
what closer than you might be ready 
to admit.” He raised his voice and 
called to Bonder: “Beautiful, son! 
Now, gang,” he called out to the 
assembled company, “we all want to 
remember that our guest isn’t com- 
pletely familiar with our customs. 
But we all know he’s going to catch 
on in no time.” 

Comp said in Jackson’s ear: “Lis- 
ten, they need the feedback of your 
approval, or the party’s going to lose 
its impetus.” 

“Oh,” Jackson said. 

“Look! Here’s Pall!” Clark point- 
ed at the entrance. 

S he came in shyly, holding her 
hands folded in front of her. 
Hanging around her waist was a 



ragged white drape of fabric; scant, 
pure unblemished white, high on one 
hip and low on the other, the loose, 
tom threads of its hem brushing her 
at mid-thigh at its lowest point. She 
came walking up to Jackson, looking 
at the ground. As she got closer to 
him, Jackson could see that there 
were grains of sand worked into her 
hair, and streaked smudges from it 
on her body. The smudges had 
clearly defined edges, and they 
weren’t any darker at the knees; 
there weren’t little rings of it in the 
skin around her wrists, and there 
wasn’t a deeper smudge of it at the 
base of her neck, in the hollow where 
perspiration would have washed it 
in the course of the day. 

But by now, Jackson had the idea. 

“Welcome home. Honor,” she said 
submissively, and the Thorn seem- 
ed to fill with the sound of the 
group’s approval — a great appreci- 
ative roar that was compounded of 
applause and outcries of admiration. 

“Tremendous!” Kringle said. 

“Look at her, Jackson!” he low- 
ered his voice. “My dear — was that 
truly an original thought of yours? 
That’s marvelous. Marvelous. Jack- 
son, you do see it, don’t you? She’s 
made a work of art of herself! This 
is doubly exciting: our little 

PaU ” 

Pall was blushing. “Thank you so 
much, Kringle.” She didn’t quite 
know what to do with her hands; 
obviously, it was the first time in her 
life she’d ever gotten a compliment 
for her creativity. “Actually,” she 
said, “you see. I’m such a naive 
person, really — oh, Kringle will 
tell you I’m not, but he’s just being 



152 



IF 




polite — I finally thought to my- 
self: ‘Well, if you’re naive, and there 
doesn’t seem to be anything you 
can do about it, you might as well 
do something constructive with it, 
wouldn’t you think? Why don’t 
you — ’ So I did! That’s really all 
there was to it. I just did, that’s all. 
1 said to myself, the thing to do is 
take what you have, and use it!” 

“I think you did fine,” Jackson 
said. “I thi^ the subtle touch of 
presenting yourself not only as a 
work of art, but as a work of art 
with a duality of meaning, is an ex- 
ample of the vitality inherent in the 
natural response.” He smiled at her, 
and touched her lightly on the shoul- 
der. The Thorn broke into fresh ap- 
plause. “It’s of course the hard un- 
derlying base of the subtle but pri- 
mary implication that really makes 
it work,” he said, looking sincerely 
into her eyes as they sparkled with 
fulfillment. Suddenly those eyes 
brimmed over, and two perfect tears 
flowed down her cheeks. 

“Thank you,” she breathed so soft- 
ly that the nearest sound receptor 
had to dart in a little closer, and 
hovered like a humming bird at her 
lips. 

P all was circulating among the 
people, being congratulated by 
everyone, not just her particular 
friends. She walked like a debutante. 

Jackson stood rubbing his left el- 
bow. 

Perry had been working at some- 
thing, behind a bunch of other peo- 
ple. “Hey, look at what Perry’s got!” 
they began to exclaim, crowding 
in behind them. 

THE IRON THORN 




“Hold on, now! Everybody’ll get 
a chance to see it!” Perry growled 
in a guff, good-natured way. 

Exteroaffectors carried it out to 
the middle of the floor for him, and 
put it up on three graceful, thin 
metal legs. High above, a rope of 
light kindled itself among the higher 
traceries of crystal, and concentrated 
its beam upon the painting. 

“Jackson! Come forward, Jack- 
son!” Perry motioned urgently from 
beside the painting. “I dedicate this 
to you.” 

Oh Jesus. But Jackson got him- 
self moving, his legs sucking up 
through glue, and went to look at 
it. 

It had been done in wide, some- 
times apparently labored, sometimes 
apparently glib strokes. It was full of 
all the wrong colors. What it show- 
ed was Jackson’s Thom, in the dis- 
tance, with the pale Sun behind it. 
Huddled at the base of the Thorn 
were square, nearly featureless 
blocks that you could tell were 
houses, because here and there there 
was a light iji a window. In the 
foreground of the painting, mostly 
in silhouette, with only a few de- 
tails picked out here and there, was 
an Amsir lying on the blind slope 
of a dune, his head raised just enough 
so he could watch the Thorn and the 
houses. And off to one side, watch- 
ing the Amsir, was the figure of a 
Honor, also blocked out crudely. 
You could tell it was a Honor be- 
cause it was wearing something on 
its head that looked like a cross be- 
tween the German army helmets of 
World War II and the Franco-Prus- 
sian War, which was intended to be a 



honning cap, Jackson supposed. 

You couldn’t really fault it for 
skill. The guy had obviously done 
work of this kind before. You could 
maybe criticize the composition, but 
you had to do it on professional 
grounds. You had to give him that 
much. But, Jesus Christ, Comp had 
the right facts on file; they were 
there to be dug out. All you had to 
do was look for them. 

“What do you think of it?” Perry 
asked, through the rising sound of 
applause as the other people crowd- 
ed around. Then he said: “Of course, 
you want to feel free to use any 
terms you want — you don’t need 
to confine yourself to the technical 
terms of the graphic arts.” There 
was an understanding little smile 
playing around the corners of his 
mouth. “After all, many of my other 
friends here would have to use lay- 
man’s language too.” 

J ackson opened his mouth, then 
closed it. He could feel the tip 
of his tongue rubbing against the 
inner faces of the teeth on one side 
of his lower jaw. 

“Go ahead,” Perry said. 

“Comp,” Jackson said, “I need an 
easel, a backing board, a sheet of 
charcoal paper and some charcoal. 
Right away, now.” 

Perry looked nonplussed. The 
crowd around them grew quiet. The 
exteroaffectors worked quickly. 

Another beam of light focused 
down, on the blank sheet at Jack- 
son’s easel. He held all but one of 
the sticks in his left hand, and 
bounced the other in his right for a 
minute as he stepped back and look- 



154 



IF 




ed around at the people. He sucked 
at his front teeth once, sharply, and 
stepped into his work. He touched 
the tip of the stick to the paper, and 
he drew them a Amsir, fanatical and 
brave, with a dart rattling loose in 
the hole punched through one of 
his main bubbles, trying to get one 
hand up and bent around enough 
to hold its fingers over the hole, 
while it marched a Honor dressed 
in human skin and sucking on an air 
bottle toward the rim of the world. 

When it was done, it was done. He 
didn’t know exactly how long he was 
at it. Nobody interrupted him. 

Lookings at it, he could see it was 
all right; he had it right. His left 
hand was black and empty. He 
dropped the last stick on the floor, 
at Perry’s feet. “That’s what I think 
of your painting,” he said. “Tech- 
nically.” 

There was a gasp from several 
of the people behind him. Perry 
frowned and stepped around to look 
at the drawing. He stood scratching 
his chin, cocking his head back and 
forth. “I’m . afraid I don’t under- 
stand. What are you trying to say 
with this?” 

There was a rising murmur of 
assent around the two of them. “Yes. 
What does that prove?” 

“Better let me have a look,” 
Kringle said, pushing forward. He 
stood beside Perry; Jackson had to 
step back to give him room. “Well, 
are you trying to equate charcoal 
with oils?” Kringle said. “It’s very 
difficult to judge between media, 
you know.” 

“What I don’t understand,” Perry 
said, “is why he felt he had to be so 



hostile about it. I see what he’s done 
here, and it’s another scene entire- 
ly. How could one arrive at a basis 
for comparison?” 

Bonder said: “Well, I think it’s a 
hell of a note, any way you look at 
it! I mean, here Perry dedicated it 
to him, at his party — we’re all 
taking part, here, for him. What does 
he want to ace like this for?” 

XXK 

J ust to make sure, Jackson took 
one last look at the difference be- 
tween Perry’s daub and his drawing. 
Then he turned around and work- 
ed his way out of the crowd. Many 
of them were trying to push forward 
and look at the twin centers of at- 
tention anyhow. The others glanced 
at him uncomfortably. Some of them 
looked at him a little distastefully, 
and others looked as if they didn’t 
know what to do, so he was able 
to get out from among them without 
coming into any kind of contact. He 
wiped the sweat off his face, and 
then, looking at his wet, half-clean 
palm, he realized he’d probably 
messed up his face pretty good. He 
walked out through the entrance 
and stood looking out at the pavil- 
ions, whose sides were responding 
gaily to the breeze. 

“Comp, I want a ship.” 

“That’s impossible. It would be 
disastrous. You know enough about 
experimental discipline to under- 
stand that. Look,” Comp soothed, 
“you’re in a mood of despair, at 
the moment, but after all, you don’t 
have to relate to these particular 
people. I told you they’re not the

only class within the population. Re- 
lax. Knock around a little. Learn 
what suits you best. Meanwhile — 
here — ” Exteroaffectors settled on 
him momentarily, and were gone. 
He was clean again, fresh-minted. 
His skin glowed. He rubbed his el- 
bow. Maybe some day he’d be all 
hollow inside? 

“You mean, I can teach Throw- 
ing Stick? How about art? I mean, 
1 could do something, and then you 
could have an election and see if it 
was any good or not. Maybe a sim- 
ple majority vote would do, and then 
I could open up a school.” 

“Well, no, I don’t think you’d 
e comfortable, do you?” 

“That leaves becoming a Comp 
:chnician, doesn’t it?” 

“The numlber of things to be 
amed there is finite, but very 
irge,” Comp said. “I assure you, 
it’s a lifetime’s occupation, and a 
constantly expanding field of knowl- 
edge. Right at the moment, for ex- 
ample, the telemetry involved in 
sending exteroceptors across inter- 
stellar distances represents a fruit- 
ful — ” 

Jackson grinned, the way he had 
seen the Eld grin. “And when you 
die, I can be you.” 

“Heavens, no I I will never die!” 
“That’s what they all think.” Jack- 
son sighed: “What’s Ahmuls doing?” 
He felt pretty lonely. 

“Ahmuls is quite contented. Here 
— ” Exteroaffectors kissed Jackson’s 
eyelids. 

At first, he thought what he saw 
was a streamlet, running brown li- 
quid, swirling amidst stones. Then 
he realized it was an aerial view of 



a vast plain. The point of view 
dropped like a skooping hawk, and 
he plunged down toward a herd of 
tossing, shaggy brown animals, mass- 
ive of head, high of shoulder, red- 
eyed, homed and hairy. Exteroaffee- 
tors nuzzled behind his ears, and he 
heard the thunder of the buffalo. 

Behind them, bounding and lurch- 
ing, came Ahmuls, silent and pur- 
poseful. He ran in a way that told 
Jackson he was straining everything 
he had, but my God how he ran, 
his flesh bagging out behind him, 
away from his face and shoulders. 
His mouth was wide open, and the 
tip of his tongue was in the comer 
of his lips. 

“This is the Mid-American Game 
Preserve,” Comp said. “You’ll notice 
the landscape has been trivially mod- 
ified to suit his requirements.” 

Indeed, there was plenty of lichen 
on the granite outcroppings that 
now split the herd into segments 
as it milled around them, and 
again funneled it into one cohesive 
mass before Ahmuls’s pursuit start- 
led it again. As he ran by one of 
them, Ahmuls threw out a hand, 
scooped off a clump and stuffed it 
into his mouth. It was impossible 
to tell whether he was trying to 
catch the animals so he could kill 
them, or whether he was merely 
attempting to join them. But in the 
milling and stampeding, there were 
almost as many behind him as there 
were ahead, and once or twice, pan- 
icked bulls, clattering and snorting 
out of tight places between the rocks, 
almost ran him down. 

“What’ll you do if he gets pound- 
ed flat?” 



156 



IF 




“Oh, there is no problem about 
that. He’d get medical attention im- 
mediately.” 

“For the rest of his life.” 

“That’s my obligation. Accidental 
factors cannot be permitted to in- 
terrupt something’s running its 
course.” Ahmuls disappeared from 
this particular exteroaffector’s sight 
as he ran behind an outcropping. 
“Do you want me to shift point of 
view, or do you want to look at 
Durstine now?” 

Jackson opened his eyes, as he 
heard her say from in front of him: 
“I wondered how long it would be 
before you came looking for me.” 

It was hard shifting from the ac- 
tuality to something he could see 
with his own eyes. It took a moment 
to organize his brain. He saw she 
was wearing some sort of crested 
helmet whose front part was a pale, 
sharp-edged mask over the up^per 
part of her face, leaving only the 
chin and red lips bare. Then he saw 
she was, in fact, gowned, unlike 
the decorated people inside. She 
stepped back, her body clad in swirl- 
ing off-white gauzeries which might 
even have been individual motes of 
pigment suspended in the air, or 
might have been some wonderful 
fabric. 

Either way, it was swirled around 
her body at the waist, caught again 
at the shoulders and the elbows. 
She laughed and sprang to tiptoe, 
her arms out straight from the 
shoulders, but bent forward at the 
elbows to point toward him. The 
movement of her body scattered out 
her garment in lacy strands, up- 
raised the crest of her mask, and 



flung wide her white wings. She 
laughed in a silvery tinkle of joy. 
“See? I knew exactly what you want- 
ed! I’m yours, yours!” she cried, 
lissomely throwing herself at him. 

He could just about get his hands 
up to catch her shoulders, and he 
felt himself wince when he touched 
them. 

“You’ve got that just exactly back- 
wards,” he said, marveling at their 
capacity. “I’ve got to admit, it’s an 
accomplishment.” 

“What? What?” She was jerking 
and tossing against his hands. 
“What’s the matter with you?” 

“It’s either you or me,” he ad- 
mitted, swinging her around to push 
her backward through the doorway, 
trying to see to it she got where she 
belonged. Now, what would Elmo 
Lincoln do in a case like this? “Go. 
Go, mangani!” he burst out, push- 
ing explosively, flinging her back- 
ward in a swirl and smother of garb. 
He was shaking with rage; he could 
hear Comp giggling. 

He glared around him. There was 
nothing in sigjit but fake, and blue 
sky full of receptor glints. Never, 
never in his life had he been so 
angry, and Comp wouldn’t stop gig- 
gling at him. He swatted at a darting 
bee. He wasn’t as fast as Ahmuls. 

He crouched facing the doorway. 
Whoever came out of there first 
was in terminal danger. He could 
see red mist edging his field of vis- 
ion, and at the same time there was 
this terrible, wonderful clarity about 
how he felt. It was an excuse for 
anything. A man brought to this 
feeling was as much a monarch as 
Tyrannosaurus Rex had ever been. 



THE IRON THORN

He prowled, ihis thigjhs flexed, his 
arms like bridge cable. 

Pall came shyly and diffidently 
out of the Thorn tent. “Don’t be 
mad, Jackson,” she said. “I know 
you’re upset.” She stretched out her 
hand and touched his fist. “I know 
how it is. They used to treat me that 
way. But I just learned to ignore it. 
And I didn’t give up; I kept trying 
to improve myself, and one day — ” 
Her eyes dropped. “Well, you saw 
how they finally admitted I was as 
good as them. Let me stay with you. 
I’ll be good for you.” 

Jackson looked up at the spiral- 
ing glints. “You see that?” he asked. 
“You hear?” 

“Certainly. Would you like to see 
an actuality of Petra Jovans?” 
Jackson shivered. “No. Don’t ever 
show me Petra Jovans. If I ever 
want to see her I’ll go look for my- 
self.” He added, looking at Pall, 
“And touch.”. 

Pall was touching his hand to her 
mouth. “Please, Jackson,” she said, 
“I really do understand you.” 

Sweet Jesus, he thought, where 
and when are you ever — 

“Oh, come on,” he said, turning 
away from the tent, holding her 
wrist. 

She trotted gracefully beside him. 
“Where are we going?” 

“I don’t know. Might find it, 
though.” He got them out between 
the pavilions, and onto the fields. 
There was some kind of path 
through the hedgerows, and he fol- 
lowed that. Exteroceptors were keep- 
ing pace with them. “This is great 
stuff!” Comp was saying. “Setting 
out for the New Eden! Man and his 



mate, on the endless journey to — ” 
“Amsir urine,” Jackson said. 

Pall stared at him. “What was 
that for?” 

What was it for? It always had to 
be for something, right? Jackson 
shook his head. She didn’t see. She 
couldn’t hear. But maybe he could 
make her. 

And maybe that was the one thing 
that would be worth his while to 
do in this place. He said: 

“You really want to know?” 

She nodded. “Very much.” 

All right. Why not? If it didn’t 
work it would pass the time, if it 
did he could — he could — 

He could do something that no- 
body had ever done before, was 
what he could; so he began: 

“The floor of the world is rippled 
like the bottom of the ocean, run- 
ning out to the edges. Those edges 
are high, and they’re cruel. At sun- 
set, the eastern horizon is the far 
wall of the crater. It’s black. Blue- 
black. The sunlight catches the top 
edge of the crater, and that’s rust 
color. It makes a long, rust-colored 
arc that seems to dip down to left 
and right like a’ wall, or a bow, or 
the trail of something that shot by 
without your noticing it, and all you 
can see is the trail it left. There are 
rocks standing on the crater floor, 
and the sunlight hitting them, just 
before it dies, turns them orange, 
too. The stars hang up there, hard 
and sharp. 

“That’s where you head for when 
you’re honning Amsirs.” 

“In the beginning, I was running 
after this bird . ”

Dear Editor; 

I have a suggestion. You have 
displayed extensive interest in de- 
veloping new writing talent; I refer 
to such activities as editorials in 
your magazines, letters to the SF- 
WA journal and of course, your 
monthly ‘^first” story in 7/ (a most 
commendable institution since it 
was my birthplace). Why not allot 
a small box-'like space in one of your 
magazines for an ‘^idea mart?” The 
feature could be epigrammatic in 
character. The following examples 
are igiven for purposes of illustra- 
tion only — no claim is made for 
their brilliance or originality. 

1. Consider a planet where 
there are extensive geologi- 
cal structures of crystallized 
virus. 

2. It is everyone’s patriotic du- 
ty to delay the thermodynam- 
ic heat death of the universe. 

3. Title; Not Responsible for 
Lost Articles. 

4. A story whose elapsed “real 
time” is, say, 10 seconds. 
10-6 seconds? 

Contributions could be either 
readers who would like to see a par- 
ticular idea developed or writers 



who have an idea which they feel 
is just not their dish of tea. 

Now, of course no writer can live 
professionally by feeding exclusive- 
ly on the ideas of others, but a be- 
ginning writer or someone lying 
becalmed on the sea of literary en- 
deavor might pick up just enough 
momentum from a timely sugges- 
tion to start his own gears grinding. 

Naturally, the purpose of your 
editorial labors is to prepare a pro- 
duct that will appeal to readers — 
not to conduct a writers’ sympos- 
ium. However, I feel that such an 
idea mart would in fact exert its 
primary appeal to readers. You 
might not increase paid circulation 
because of it, but you’d probably 
have the best-thumbed SF magazine 
on the newsstand ! — W. I. Mc- 
Laughlin, 1096 Sixth Street, Al- 
bany, California. 

# How about that? If anybody has 
ideas for the “Idea Mart”, send 
them along and we’ll print the best 
of them. Everybody understand the 
rules? Once they’re printed they be- 
long to anybody who wants to use 
them. A good way to start might 
be with, “Say, why doesn’t somebody 
write a science-fiction story that — ” 
. and then go on from there. Who 
knows? The Hugo-winner of 1969

may come from your sngg^estion! — 
Editor, 

♦ ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

Did you know that you are con- 
tributinig to the breakdown of my 
mental health? 

At one time I was of the opinion 
that a certain other SF Magazine 
was the most outstanding magazine 
to come down the pike in many 
moons. 

But the last year has been driv- 
ing me around the bend. Such stor- 
ies as The Moon Is a Harsh Mis- 
tress, Dam Nuisance, Earthhlood, 
Arena, A Relic of Empire and Star- 
path have caused me to undertake 
a serious re-evaluation of the num- 
ber one position. 

Now the other magazine is still 
very good, but the choice between 
the two of you is very difficult to 
say the least. This is my dilemma. 
My loyalty to the previous leader 
is conflicting with my anticipation 
whenever I see the new issue of If 
on the stands. Loyalty says nay, 
but anticipation says yea. 

So I guess ITl just have to learn 
to live with it. And, if you continue 
to maintain your high level of fic- 
tion, I know I shall. Thank you, 
gentlemen, for much pleasure I — 
Joseph J. Miller, 410 East 12th 
Street, Okmulgee, Oklahoma. 

♦ ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

Why are so many people turned 
off to science fiction? . Must be 
some way to turn them on. Any 
ideas?” 

I'm glad you asked. 

I started my love affair with sci- 
ence fiction back in the last half 
of the 1930's. The Crescent Depart- 
ment Store in Spokane, Washing- 
ton, was the only place in town that 



I knew of where I could be fairly 
sure of finding s-f magazines or, 
rarely, a book. The s-f stuff was 
right out on the stands in plain 
sight, but the saleswoman tended 
to look slightly embarrassed when 
they took my 15c or 25c (or $2.50 
for a book), and they carefully 
wrapped up my purchase (though 
Saturday Review or Atlantic left 
the store nude) so that I could 
hide my shame. In short, a nice 
girl simply didn't parade her i)oor 
taste ... or possibly her poor in- 
telligence. S-f was something like 
the family idiot; you might sympa- 
thize and sell the family food and 
clothing for the poor thing, but 
they bought anonymously and kept 
the creature decently locked in the 
cupola room. 

But I persisted. My addiction fin- 
ally became respectable, even ad- 
mirable in some quarters. When my 
husband and I went to Richland 
(the residential town by Hanford 
atomic works) where we counted 
some half-dozen or more Ph.D.'s to 
the block, we toe’: the last step: a 
taste for s-f was a “doesn't-every- 
one?” thing. 

I still buy magazines and books 
and haunt libraries, but frankly I 
see few stories that are up to those 
of the 1940's and 1950's. I've been 
reduced to re-reading from my own 
library. Take a look at the stories 
of those times. 

A simple secret: The authors had 
a story to tell, built up by extrap- 
olation, around characters who 
seemed “real” and with whom the 
reader could identify. The authors 
might be “drawing a moral to adorn 
a tale”: as in Space Merchants . 
whither are we wending in a society 
so ruled by Madison Avenue tech- 
niques and trends? Or in Caves of 



160 



IF 




Steel . what will be the ultimate 
problems of our growing megalo- 
plitan culture? Or in Search the 
Skies . will the time come, with 
increasing population, that gene 
drift in an increasingly in-bred 
world will make earth-population 
monstrous? But moral or not, the 
story was paramount. The authors 
were not mounting soap-boxes as 
professors suffering from suppura- 
tion of the typewriter. 

Too many of the books (not to 
speak of the short stories which tag 
along in the footprints of their bet- 
ters) seem , to me to be busily sell- 
ing the author’s latest fixation. The 
Heinlein who could write (and did 
write) Day After Tomorrow (Sixth 
Column) or Puppet Masters or Door 
Into Summer is the same Heinlein 
who now turns out The Moon Is a 
Harsh MistresSy or that book whose 
name slips my mind about the fam- 
ily that is plunged into a parrallel 
world by an atomic bomb where a 
colored race breeds plump little 
white maidens for dinner. In both 
the last two named, Heinlein seems 
more busy being sociology professor 
than a story-teller. 

I enjoy studying. While I’ve taken 
no graduate courses in the past 10 
years, we will have ten or twelve 
professional journals of one sort 
or another coming to our home, and 
I read those and a good deal of ma- 
terial that would qualify as ‘‘think- 
pieces.” But when I totter off to 
bed after a day of housework, being 
chauffeur to kid-and-husband con- 
tingent, and maybe even a bit of 
writing, I want io read a story un- 
til the rest of the family beds down. 
I don’t want to be educated in some- 
one’s idea of the way new sociologi- 
cal standards or psychological pat- 
terns could create the best of all 



possible worlds. Especially I don’t 
want to read a treatise masquerad- 
ing as a story with characters who 
seem not at all like anyone I’ve 
ever known or could ever myself be. 
It’s a pity, but when the author 
tries too hard to teach, he ceases 
to interest me. To be trite, if he 
wants to send a message, let him 
use Western Union. 

Nor do I want to read of weirdies 
of the Van Vogt school or purely 
imaginary-type fantasy planets 
around a purely-maybe sun. I may 
not be able to the characters I’m 
reading about ... I howled like 
a lost pup all through the required 
math and statistics courses in grad- 
uate school, so how could I be a 
fabulous scientist? But not every 
little girl who thrilled over Cinder- 
ella was either pretty enough or 
charming enough to 6e a Cinderella 
nor every little boy who read big- 
eyed of Robin Hood could beard and 
defeat the wicked Sheriff of Not- 
tingham. Still, Cinderella was a 
girl, wasn’t she? And Robin Hood 
was once a boy? And the Once and 
Future King Arthur was once a boy 
who was pretty small potatoes 
around the court. I do not, you see, 
rule out all magic (or for the S-F 
stories, all future science). But I 
want it to be believable, possible if 
not completely probable . and I 
want it to SOUND probable, which 
is the test of the efficiency of the 
extrapolation of the author. 

I realize the problem of the writer 
is becoming harder and harder as 
the boundaries are pushed outward. 
He can’t lay a story on Mars now 
with every possibility of a satellite 
‘‘proving” that there isn’t enough 
air or water to keep a lichen alive 
. and maybe proving it before 
the story can hit the newsstands. 



HUE & CRY 



161 




I wrote a story once wihidi I never 
tried to sell (because it wasn’t up 
to Kombluth & Poihl or Heinlein or 
Asimov) and ran across the manu- 
script the other day. It really wasn’t 
bad . not, at least, compared 
to most of the stories of the past 
few years. But it was laid on Venus 
(or most of it was) ; and Venus, 
according to our probes, has some- 
thing like high enough heat to 
melt lead. It rather looks as if the 
writer today has to depend on FTL 
and nucleophoresis to shunt his 
characters clear out of the solar 
system. OR he can extrapolate and 
lay his stories in the far future of 
the Earth like Space Merchants . 
and believe me, he could do worse. 

But if the author takes that line, 
what can he write about? Door Into 
Summer and Immortality, Inc. pic- 
tures the scientific future, Space 
Merchants shows the Madison Ave- 
nue future carried to a reasonable 
conclusion, one whose name slips my 
mind shows a future completely 
^Hnsured”. Well, that’s the problem. 
Someone has written of a time when 
overcrowded mankind has taken to 
the ocean, and if someone hasn’t 
yet done so, someone can write a 
story of the seabottom dwellers (I 
think I’ve read a story about that.) 
But the field is limited by the ex- 
pansion of space information, and 
the space flight so soon to come. 

After all this long letter, I’ve only 
said what I feel is wrong. I have 
offered no solution. 

I haven’t seen a new Asimov, Pohl 
or Brackett story for ages. Hein- 
lein and Blish and Clarke have slid 
off the tracks of the type of book 
where the story comes first. 

Maybe the solution is to call all 
the old hands into a building, lock 
the door after supplying them with 



the good old stories they used to 
write, and then say, ‘‘Pals, read 
these. Then go and do it again. A 
manuscript with the story first is 
your key to freedom.” And then 
hope for the best. 

But what’ll happen? 

You know: they’ll write some ed-

# Thanks for a good letter, Mrs. 
McClintock — and thank all of you, 
for that matter. Seems to us the 
mail has been unusually interesting 
lately, which is why we squeezed 
out a little extra space this time 
and will try to do so again. 

Let’s see. This month’s “First”, 
as you will see, is W. I. Johnstone’s 
Family Loyalty. Next month we 
start a new Keith Laumer serial. 
Spaceman! — not a Retief story 
(but we have some of those on hand 
to print shortly thereafter). And 
our next few issues will include 
Philip Jose Farmer, Samuel R. De- 
lany, Andre Norton, Lester del Rey, 
Fred Saberhagen’s Berserkers . 
yes, some first-rate stuff, we think. 
Join us and see! — Editor.

IF 




Do you have a restless urge to write? 



If so, you have much in common 
with successful authors. 

Read how 1 2 Famous Writers are 
helping people turn a restless urge for 
self-expression into success in writing 

There's something different ahoul people who 
feel the urge to write. They have a spiritual 
hunger that .sets them apart — even from family 
tmd friends. 

If you have known this burning need to write, 
>OLi, too, may have the gift successful authors 
possess . the recurring ache to put into words 
your innermost thoughts, your own experiences. 

Max Shulman started writing because . it 
was write or bust." I aith Baldwin, after 80 
novels, still says: "V\c never written exactly 
what I dreamed I'd write . you keep on try- 
ing." Successful authors like these know that 
this restless urge for self-expression is perhaps 
the most important ingredient of writing suc- 
cess. But, they realize it can waste away if you 
don't know how to get started w riting, or if you 
hesitate to try. 

Several years ago they joined forces with 
Rod wSerling, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, Mig- 
non G. Kberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, 
Mark Wiseman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith and 
Bergen F.vans, to form the Famous Writers 
School. They poured everything they knew 
about writing into a remarkable new kind of 
professional training course which trains you 
at home in your spare time. You begin with 
the fundamentals of all good writing — then 
specialize in Fiction, Non-Fiction, Advertising 
Writing or Business Writing. 

Fach of your assignments is examined by an 
instructor who is a professional writer or editor. 

He goes over your work line by line, word by 
word, blue-penciling his changes right on your 
manuscript, much as an editor does with an 
established author. Then he returns it with a 
long letter of advice and guidance. 

This training works well. Our students have 
sold their writing to the Reader’s Digest, 




R '''d '?’'ling S urge to write made him a 
If i'. ig r v' diamatisl (Twilight Zone, Palterns, 
} e for a Heavyweight) and won him 

six Fmmy awards. 



Ladies' Honie Journal, Fantasy and Science Fic- 
tion, and more than 100 other publications.
