THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, Jack Finney 

A spellbinding film classic of a nightmare come true 
. The people in Santa Mira, California, didn’t feel 
any different when it happened— in fact, they didn’t 
feel anything at all. One by one, they were being 
transformed into men and women who looked like 
themselves, acted like themselves, but were not 
themselves.

OFF CENTER, Damon Knight 

“Be My Guest,” a story of the human race possessed 
by demonic things is Just one of the unpredictably 
imaginative tales in this fascinating collection by a 
modern master of science fiction. 

“The fiction of Damon Knight . has that unpre- 
tentious ease and rightness which a reviewer calls, 
for lack of a more analytical term, readability. Knight 
is surely one of the most civilized s. f. writers.”

ing her way through her studies by dou- 
bling as a secretary to DR. KLA Y, 
chairman of Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. LYN and 
AMAL discover something in com- 
mon: she seems gifted with occasion- 
al prescience and has a certain tal- 
ent for reading, with reasonable ac- 
curacy, people's thoughts from their 
facial expressions. AMAL, she dis- 
covers, has a strange ability to see in- 
to the past — this is his first visit to the 
United States, yet he seems to “re- 
member” events that happened here 
in 1934, more than a hundred years 
earlier. As a psychologist, LYN is 
fascinated. She and AMAL go to the 



historic restoration village of 
Dotham, Alabama, on the outskirts 
of Los Angeles, to research his 
“recollections” and discover they 
seem to tie in with the life of a racing 
driver, LEROY THATCHER, killed 
in an auto accident in 1934. 

LYN and AMAL fnd time to fall 
in love. 

Through her work with the board of 
supervisors, LYN provides AMAL 
with access to the Cal Edison mo- 
holes, 7000 meters underground, to 
install his stress sensors on the San 
A ndreas fault lines. 

On April 26, 2062, AMAL predicts

for the Los Angeles area, to hit on 
May 5, 2062, at exactly 1:33 P.M. 
His petition to the board of super- 
visors to have the city evacuated is 
turned down. With the assistance of 
HAL CARPENTER, journalist 
and student, RED BENTON, gradu- 
ate student in law and LYN, AMAL 
manages to get his warning to the 
populace through underground 
publications and via an effective 
holographic dramatic presentation 
staged by the Cal Tech dramatics de- 
partment and starring beauteous 
student GLORIA JAFFEE. 

In the meantime DR. HEYWOOD 
has learned that South Africa’s AE 7, 
a precociously brilliant mining en- 
gineer, has made his major contri- 
bution to society — a mining break- 
through — and self-destructed in a Jo- 
hannesburg mine cave-in, acciden- 
tally taking thousands of lives with 
him. Another AE 7, a young Madrid 
chemical engineer, makes a major 
breakthrough in chemistry — and in- 
nocently self-destructs in an explo- 
sion claiming 17,000 other lives. Rus- 
sia's AE 7, a poetess, completes her 
major epic and dies — inadvertent- 
ly causing 70,000 other deaths. 

It now becomes imperative to 
stop AMAL. But he has gone into hid- 
ing, having laid himself open to pos- 
sible prosecution for violation of 
conspiracy laws because of the un- 
derground publication of his earth- 
quake warning — the penalty may be 
death. 

His dramatic presentation featur- 
ing the warning and starring 
GLORIA JAFFEE in the meantime 
has come under fire as causing public 
panic, and a legal petition is insti- 
tuted by the Professional Mothers 
Association to halt its showing. 



AMES OSBORNE’S costume 
went beyond the flamboyance 
permitted by his age into those 
realms of the grotesque labeled 
by fashion-fanciers “Southern 
California trial lawyer.” His 
most conservative element of 
dress was a lace handkerchief 
which fluttered from beneath his 
cuff. The boots he strode in were of 
beaten silver. His gray curls 
kissed the velvet of his scarlet 
cape — the very air was amorous 
of his jeweled hands. Counselor 
Osborne’s entrance into the 
hearing room had to be seen to be 
disbelieved — and Amal was ab- 
sent. 

Osborne, Lyn decided, had 
dressed to match the orotund, bal- 
anced sentences of the eighteenth- 
century prose that rolled from 
him. Yet the rhetoric of his open- 
ing plea revealed aspects of Los 
Angeles — the Last Day Lyn had 
missed completely. 

He spoke of danger in the 
panicky crowds created by the 
spectacular, of the show’s linger- 
ing traumatic effect, of night- 
mares thus engendered. Next he 
planted a few traumas himself, 
warning the budget-minded of 
lawsuits against the city brought 
by the injured. Eor the civic- 
minded he spoke of industries 
frightened away from Los An- 
geles by earthquake scares. To the 
atheists he denounced religious 
crackpots who predicted the 
doom of the city. He reminded the 
religiously inclined that Los An- 
geles, named for the mother of Je- 
sus, was hardly a fit city for God’s

GALAXY 




wrath. Osborne had something 
for everybody. 

When Red Benton rose for the 
rebuttal he didn’t rebut. Instead 
he asked to see the credentials of 
the most famous trial lawyer in 
Los Angeles. Tolerantly Os- 
borne complied, handing Red his 
credentials card. As Red studied 
the card, he stood in sordid con- 
trast to Osborne’s elegance. He 
y/ore scuffed shoes and shiny blue 
serge suit, a stained and ill-knotted 
tie beneath his frayed collar. His 
hair was close-cropped. In a pa- 
thetic, last-minute effort to match 
the older man’s stylishness Red 
had stuffed a soiled handkerchief 
up his cuff. 

He seemed to be having diffi- 
culty reading the list of honors on 
the back of Osborne’s card. His 
tips were moving. 

“By golly, Mr. Osborne — you 
made three-eighty-eight on your 
bar exam out of a possible four 
hundred. That’s pretty high.’’ 

“It’s a record that has stood for 
twenty years.’’ 

Red handed the card back and 
said, “If I made a score like that I 
would know I had a friend on the 
examining board.’’ 

Slightly miffed, Osborne said, 
“I trust your nonsequitur isn’t an 
inference on my integrity.’’ 

“No, sir! Nobody’s more ad- 
mired by students than you, Mr. 
Osborne. 1 once paid five dollars 
just to hear you lecture.’’ 

“Yes,’’ Osborne said, molli- 
fied, “I do rate highly in the es- 
teem of students.’’ 

“You sit right down, sir. I’d like 
to swear you in as my first witness. 
I got no real reason to question 



you, but students don’t often get 
a chance to talk to Counselor 
James Osborne face to face — and 
for free.’’ 

S UDDENLY Lyn was glad 
Amal had not yet arrived in the 
hearing room. As Osborne was 
being sworn in. Red turned and 
shuffled away. Then, in full view 
of spectators and board mem- 
bers, Red Benton scratched his be- 
hind. 

Some onlookers sniggered at 
the gaucherie. One burst out laugh- 
ing. Apparently oblivious. Red 
turned back to Osborne. 

“Mr. Osborne, when you were a 
student you must have studied 
hard to make such good grades. 
Nothing works for me. I tried 
sleep-teaching and self-hyp- 
nosis.’’ 

“I have an excellent memory 
and a superb ability to elicit gen- 
eral principles from the law and 
apply them in particular situ- 
ations. Industry and self-appli- 
cation are, of course, the first re- 
quirement . .’’ 

Surprisingly Osborne took 
five minutes of his valuable time 
to explain to the student how he 
had studied. Red listened with 
adulatory intentness. He had 
promised her some tricks, Lyn re- 
membered, but why was he send- 
ing Osborne on an ego trip? 

“That’s technique, Mr. Os- 
borne. That speech you just gave 
was talent. I don’t think I ever 
heard anybody talk as good as 
you.’’ 

“Plato defines rhetoric as the 
chief art, young man. At the age of 
fourteen I memorized The Trial 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

of Warren Hastings and recited 
it with pebbles in my mouth . 

Osborne took another five 
minutes to explain how he had 
achieved his talent as an orator. 

“I sure wish I could talk as you 
do. You’ve got a flair, Mr. Os- 
borne. I bet you’ve never lost a 
case.” 

Osborne smiled. “In my twenty 
years of practice I have, of course, 
lost a few, but my percentile rate 
of success . .” 

When Osborne had completed 
his lecture on success Red com- 
mented, “I can see why you 
charge high for your services.” 

“My fees are above average, 
yes. Considerably above, though 
not out of line with the talent and 
experience they command. Be- 
sides, I have a select clientele. It 
can afford my fees — ” 

“Mr. Osborne,’’ Red inter- 
rupted, “if I was a lawyer like you 
I’d say there’s a discrepancy here. 
You’re working for the mothers’ 
union and everybody knows they 
don’t make much. Unless this is 
one of your philan — philan — 
charity cases.” 

“I never work for nothing,” 
Osborne said, aggrieved. “The 
city appoints run-of-the-mill at- 
torneys as public defenders.” 

“Then the mothers must be roll- 
ing in wealth.” 

“The mothers are supported 
by other civic-minded organi- 
zations and business groups.” 

“Who are these other groups, 
sir?” Red asked. 

“That’s priviliged informa- 
tion.” 

“Not any longer, Mr. Os- 
borne,” Red’s voice had lost its 



hesitant quality. “Under the 
Truth in Advertising Law of 
nineteen-seventy-one you’re re- 
quired to furnish evidence of your 
assertions.” 

“Just how do the laws of adver- 
tising apply here?” 

“You’ve been advertising 
yourself and the quality of your 
clientele for the last fifteen min- 
utes.” 

“Only in answer to your ques- 
tions.” 

“No, sir. In response to my re- 
marks. Mr. Chairman, I request 
that the stenographer read the 
substance of my remarks. They 
will show Mr. Osborne has been 
asked only one question — who is 
paying his fees?” 

Lyn read aloud Red Benton’s 
remarks. There was not a ques- 
tion among them save the last. 

B y order of the chairman 
and under oath Osborne was 
required to list the sources of the 
fees paid him for entering the 
plea. The mothers had strange 
bedfellows. Some of Osborne’s 
contributors were understand- 
ably in his camp, such as the All- 
Year-Round Club of Southern 
California and the California 
Auto Club, but one contribution 
drawing a gasp from the crowd 
was five thousand dollars by the 
Los Angeles Association of 
Morticians. 

Red Benton entered a plea to 
the chairman. 

“Sir, this list speaks for itself. 
The contribution of the mothers, 
a mere one hundred dollars, 
points to the fact that they are be- 
ing used — unknowingly. I’m 



10 



GALAXY 




sure — as a front for others. Since 
Mr. Osborne has made such a 
touching appeal ‘to our civic 
pride, I request that the chair ask 
the representatives of the or- 
ganizations present which have 
contributed to Mr. Osborne’s fee 
of fifteen thousand, four hundred 
dollars to step out from behind 
the skirts of the mothers and come 
to the witness stand to explain 
their contributions.” 

Only one man rose and came 
forward at Kley’s request. He was 
Merriweather Andrews, head of 
the Los Angeles chapter of the 
American Demographer’s As- 
sociation. Old enough to have 
survived the Holocaust, An- 
drews came forward as rapidly as 
his physical condition per- 
mitted and was sworn in. Since he 
was formally a hostile witness. 
Red questioned him first. 

“Mr. Andrews, would you ex- 
plain why a demographer would 
contribute funds to a petition to 
suspend a student documentary 
conceived and executed as an 
educational experiment?” 

“Yes, sir. My organization is 
dedicated to the public good — and 
the greatest public good is a nega- 
tive population index.” 

“Surely you’re aware, sir, that 
such a trend already exists?” 

“Yes siree!” The old man ex- 
ploded with enthusiasm. “But 
let’s help it along, 1 say. I read 
where some young fellow was pre- 
dicting an earthquake Wednes- 
day. Sounds reasonable to me. 
I’ve been predicting one for sev- 
enty years. During the popula- 
tion sink — hell, I was hoping for 
one.”

with backgrounds, anecdotes, notes, 
comments, praise, blame, and a 
sturdy section on sword and sorcery 
which we freely admit is not our dish 
but it has a place, it really does. And 
somewhere, sometime, an epic s & s 
will hit us in the schnozz and we will 
publish it. 



We gave you a very quick once- 
over-lightly on our s.f. last time round, 
so to remind: 



TRULLION — ALASTOR: 2262. 

the first brand new, all un-previousiy- 
published novel we've had from Jack 
Vance in too tong. It's the start of a 
series to be based on the worlds of the 
Alastor Cluster. Pure Vance. We don't 
need to say more. 



THE END BRINGERS, Douglas R. 
Mason, in all of his jivey. fast-talk, 
fliparounds of the distant future — 
this one to do with androids. An ex- 
citing story, well done. And watch out 
for Robert Wells' RIGHT-HANDED 
WILDERNESS, as tension-filled as 
any we've seen. 



Alan Dean Foster's BLOOD HYPE 
is a worthy sequel to his TAR-AIYM 
KRANG, really solid, bang-on adven- 
ture. and Morgan and Kippax are at it 
again with a new Venturer novel THE 
NEUTRAL STARS. When it's that 
good, you can call it space opera with- 
out smiling.

His enthusiasm was con- 
tagious. The spectators were 
smiling. 

“Looky here, young fellow. 
You can take a drive on Sunday. 1 
remember when a Sunday after- 
noon’s drive had to start on Satur- 
day. We built highways with taxes 
from five hundred million peo- 
ple. There are less than half of that 
now. Cut out a few more and 
there’ll be tennis courts on the 
freeways.” 

“Are you saying you hope for 
an earthquake?” 

“Not hoping, son. Just think- 
ing; Maybe ...” 

“You don’t want the people pre- 
pared, so you donate to a cam- 
paign to stop their preparations?” 

“Prepared? Who’s ever pre- 
pared to die? Won’t be anybody in 
those towers but damned fools 
who’ve been warned. So good rid- 
dance.” 

“What about your own life, Mr. 
Andrews?” 

“I’m leaving for Halifax to- 
night.” 

The spectators laughed and, af- 
ter the room fell silent. Red turned 
to Osborne, “Your witness. 
Counselor.” 

“No questions,” Osborne 
snapped. 

In one of the shortest deliber- 
ations in committee history, six 
black balls and one white rattled 
into the bowl and the mothers’ 
petition was denied. Lyn’s an- 
nouncement was greeted with ap- 
plause. 

A MAL and Hal were still absent 
when she met with Red in the 
automat. He had risen so in her

her esteem that she offered him a 
lift back to the tower as they 
sipped coffee, hoping the other 
two might arrive. 

“When you came shambling out 
to match Osborne’s splendor 1 
thought you were pleading nolo 
contendere,” she confessed. 

“It was a part of the act,” Red 
said. “1 was giving Osborne a 
false sense of security. Dramat- 
ics is a required subject for law 
students at U.S.C. — and I have a 
flair for acting. The character 
was based on Will Rogers, an 
early actor whose film clips I 
studied. The scratching was bor- 
rowed from another actor in an 
old movie. The times are changing 
in legal circles. Shakespeare’s los- 
ing to Stanislo\l'.” 

“Luckily for us that funny old 
man was in the audience.” 

“Oh, ‘Merry’ Andrews? I sus- 
pect his donation to the mothers’ 
cause came from the Students’ As- 
sistance Fund. I talked over our 
defense with Amal.” 

“He wouldn’t. Red. Bribing a 
witness is a crime.” 

“Amal knows it. I’ve coached 
him on the legal pitfalls of state- 
less persons. But he would have no 
trouble twisting Gloria Jaffee’s 
arm.” 

“Finish your coffee,’’ she 
snapped. ‘“I’ve got to get home and 
make a telephone call.” 

Her mind was seething as she 
gunned the Dunemaster to the 
freeway and zipped toward Uni- 
versity Tower, ignoring her 
passenger completely. Red had 
revealed more than she had asked 
for when he said Amal could 
“twist” Gloria Jaffee’s arm. She 



knew Amal occasionally had 
been seeing Gloria alone, theo- 
retically on business. Now she 
wondered about that business. 
Had Gloria been demonstrating 
her S waves and L waves to the 
seismologist? 

Since Dotham, Amal had been 
attentive and devoted to her, Lyn 
admitted, but he had been too 
dedicated — no, consecrated — to his 
damned earthquake to be amorous. 
At least she had thought his con- 
cern had been the earthquake. But 
with her bought red hair, her canti- 
levered bra and a mincing twitch to 
her overpadded hips. The Barbie 
doll of the Cinema Department 
could have been producing a few 
private spectaculars for a naive 
Arabian who had gone ape over 
Jean Harlow in The Redheaded 
Woman. 

Now it was becoming clear to 
Lyn why Amal had missed a hear- 
ing that meant so much to all of 
them. After he and Gloria, il- 
legally and unethically, had 
hired a senile old man to tear Os- 
borne’s petition to shreds, Amal 
had known in advance what the 
outcome of the hearing would be. 

And just where was Miss Gloria 
Jaffee during the hearing? In a 
Cal Tech pod with Amal Severn? 
Lyn wheeled the Dunemaster into 
the parking basement, swerved 
into her parking place, slammed 
on the brakes and asked Red Ben- 
ton, “Just where was Gloria Jaf- 
fee during the hearing?” 

“Near the front row, center,” 
Red said. “She left early, while you 
were in the deliberations room, to 
catch a train for New Jersey. She 
asked me to tell you she hoped you

weren’t killed during the quake.” 
No, only maimed, Lyn thought. 

T here had been another spec- 
tator in the audience — Dr. John 
Heywood, whose name Lyn had 
heard once and forgotten. He had 
devoted little attention to the 
flamboyant Osborne, but stud- 
ied carefully the girl at the coun- 
cil table on the dais, marking her 
high forehead, thin lips, strong jaw 
and alert, intelligent eyes. Nils 
Larsen had been remiss in de- 
scribing her beauty. It was clas- 
sic. And there were harmonies in 
the movement of her lithe, poised 
body. Little wonder Amal Severn 
had broken the restraints of his 
conditioning. 

There was no doubt in Hey- 
wood’s mind that Lyn Oberlin had 
made the telephone call to Colum- 
bia, South Carolina. 

Next Heywood had studied the 
techniques of Red Benton. He 
had seen at the outset of the hear- 
ing that Osborne was in a contest 
with a superb legal mind. Hey- 
wood had departed at midpoint in 
the hearing, knowing that Amal 
Severn had erected around him- 
self formidable bulwarks against 
his fate. 

Heywood was back in his office 
at Cal Tech as Lyn entered her 
apartment to call Amal. Reluc- 
tantly, the head of the Depart- 
ment of Experimental Genetics 
was putting through a call to the 
chief of an obscure bureau in the 
U.S. State Department. 

A mal was out, NUs Larsen told 
her, but had left word he would 
call her later in the evening. 



Later in the evening proved to be 
past eleven and the fatigue etched 
on Amal’s face on the screen drove 
from Lyn’s mind any discussion 
of a tenuous and still uncertain 
personal problem that con- 
cerned them both. Amal had got 
the news of the hearing on the 
radio, but he smiled at her first- 
hand report on Osborne’s regalia 
and Red’s tactics. 

“Red hinted that Merry An- 
drews might have been a plant. If 
you had a hand on it I’m going to 
lecture you on the ethics of city 
government,” she told him. 

“Give your lecture on ethics to 
the marines,” he said. “Red 
briefed me on the ordinances 
against stateless persons. You 
won’t be hearing from me per- 
sonally for a while, but you can al- 
ways locate me through Nils. Lis- 
ten carefully to what he says and 
limit your conversation to busi- 
ness matters.” 

From the grin he directed off- 
telephone, Lyn knew Nils was in 
the room and listening. 

“Ed like to spend all my time 
with you,” Amal added, “but I’m 
skewered by urgeney. I’ll contact 
you in the morning about the work 
I’m doing but, for now, good 
night — and bands of angels lull 
thee to thy rest.” 

Quoting Hamlet’s epitaph to her 
was hardly the best way to send 
her to bed, she thought, but he was 
tired. His shoulders were slump- 
ing. Though he was smiling as he 
hung up, she could feel his weari- 
ness even over the telephone. 

Vaguely troubled by her first 
premonition in weeks, she pre- 
pared for bed. In the past, when the

forms of her future hovered close, 
they had been neither sinister nor 
hostile, only watchful and indif- 
ferent. Tonight a menace seemed 
to be waiting behind the curtain 
of time. 

Her feeling came merely from 
her concern over Amal’s fatigue, 
she told herself as she lay back, 
trying to relax. She had glimpsed 
a wistfulness in his eyes, a yearn- 
ing for rest. An after-image of his 
face lingered in her mind after she 
turned out the bedlamp, the image 
stirring a memory of something 
not seen but sensed, a complex of 
feelings, tenuous, indefinable, 
just beyond her recollection. 

In the hiatus between waking 
and sleeping her memory made 
the connection that had eluded 
her conscious mind and she re- 
membered that the emotions had 



come to her from a poem by Keats 
Amal had read to her on the 
Emersons’ porch: 

and I shall die. 

Like a sick eagle 
looking at the sky. 

For a moment she sat up in bed, 
seeking full wakefulness to 
sweep from her the ineffable and 
black despair into which she had 
been falling in her sleep. Osborne 
had promised her nightmares, a 
crude trick for triggering the sub- 
conscious into autosugges- 
tion her nightmare had been ap- 
proaching on the subliminally 
recalled lines about death. 

She lay back to a sound sleep. If 
she died in an earthquake — then, 
as Merry Andrews had said, she 
deserved to die. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

T he morning brought Lyn less 
faith in her analytical power and 
more in her psychic power. When 
she started down to breakfast she 
found outside her door an eight- 
page newspaper with a banner 
headline: 

EARTHQUAKE EXPERT 
PREDICTS “great 
PALMDALE” TO STRIKE 
TOMORROW AT 1:33 P.M. 

Amal had “contacted” her about 
his work, in a manner that put him 
outside the law. She took the pa- 
per and stepped inside, knowing 
that in her hand was the project 
that he and Hal had discussed 
secretly on the day of the first 
hearing. Now both would be open 
to all manner of charges, not the 
least of which was publishing an 
unlicensed newspaper. The un- 
derground press had been revived 
in Los Angeles to spread a pro- 
scribed rumor and incite civic tur- 
moil; and Amal, despite his vul- 
nerability, shared in this con- 
spiracy. A cold wind was blowing 
in her mind as she opened the news- 
paper. 

The feature article inside sup- 
ported the headlines with a sum- 
mary of Amal’s findings from the 
stress sensors, explained his solar 
tides theory in relation to the 
coming eclipse of the sun and, in 
the clearest exposition she had 
yet read, explained the fluctua- 
tions in the Earth’s magnetic field. 
Safety zones around towers were 
defined and all beach dwellers in 
cottages, houseboats or towers 
adjacent to the sea were urged to 
evacuate inland beyond the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault Line. 



On the last page an editorial ad- 
mitted the editor had placed his 
person and career in jeopardy by 
publishing the prediction in the 
belief that if only one life were 
saved through his act he would con- 
sider his gain worth more than the 
Pulitzer Prize for Journalism. 
Despite her alarm Lyn smiled. 
With the mention of the Pulitzer 
Prize for Journalism, Hal Car- 
penter might as well have signed 
the editorial. 

She was a quarter-hour late to 
the commissary where she found 
the underground paper far more 
in evidence at the tables than the 
morning edition of The Times- 
Herald. The usual chatter of 
breakfasting students was sub- 
dued. Four, sometimes five or six 
students were gathered at each ta- 
ble talking or listening intently. 

Seated alone with an untouched 
roll and coffee, Lyn’s thoughts 
swirled around Amal. Superfi- 
cially he was not harmed by the 
publication of his prediction, 
which was a matter of public 
record, but he was involved in the 
conspiracy to publish the pa- 
per — given his nature he couldn’t 
have acted otherwise. She could 
only hope he had taken care to pre- 
vent any evidence from pointing 
directly toward him. 

“May 1 join you, Lyn?” 

Rising, her glance traversed the 
two-meter frame of Wallace 
Bergner, a graduate geologist 
whose pod was on the same floor as 
her own. He was dressed in a busi- 
ness suit with white shirt and tie. 
His hair was neatly trimmed and 
brushed, and his brown eyes, mag- 
nified by horn-rimmed specta- 



16 



GALAXY 




cles, held a rather gentle plea. 

“Of course, Wallace. Sit down.” 

Her welcome was not a polite 
formality. Wallace Bergner's 
thoughts, easily read because of 
his magnified eye movements, 
were never obnoxious. He sel- 
dom dated girls but spent his odd 
hours exercising on Muscle 
Beach. His libido was sublimat- 
ed in physical culture — he waS in- 
fatuated with his own biceps and 
triceps. 

He carried no tray, only a cup of 
black coffee, and as he settled 
across the table from her he pulled 
a packet of wheat germ from his 
coat pocket to sprinkle into his 
coffee. 

“The thirty-second floor is hav- 
ing a picnic in the woods Wednes- 
day noon,” he said, “and other 
residents would like to have you 
join them. It’s a pound party with 
different guests bringing differ- 
ent items. Here’s a map showing 
the area where our group will meet 
and a list of items we’d like you to 
bring.” 

She barely glanced at the mim- 
eographed sheet he handed her, 
because his eyes had told her he 
was the evacuation leader for the 
32nd floor. The information 
vexed her. She was supposed to be 
an inner member of the earth- 
quake committee, and without 
her advice or knowledge the 
tower had been organized, floor 
by floor, obviously with care 
since Wallace was the most com- 
manding figure on her level. In 
this feat of secret organization 
she detected the fine hand of the 
expert on Student Restraint 
Laws, Red Benton. 



Deliberately studying the brown 
eyes across from her, she said, 
“I’m sorry, Wallace, but I have a 
one o’clock class Wednesday.” 

His eyes revealed his confusion. 
“It won’t be a picnic without you, 
Lyn.” 

She glanced at the list he had 
handed her. 

“This is a strange picnic list. 
Wall ace. Who could eat two leg 
sprints and four hundred yards of 
one-inch bandage gauze? Eight 
cadmium one-phase batteries — 
aren’t those for hand lasers? Sure- 
ly yciu’re not holding a turkey 
shoot with laser guns?” 

She looked at him and saw him 
thinking: But she’s supposed to 
know about us. He told me to 
guard her with my life. Why is she 
staring at me? 

Suddenly he steadied on an in- 
spiration. 

“A friend of yours said you 
might bring some pemmican.” 

Then it was Amal who had as- 
signed him as her bodyguard. Sud- 
denly she smiled. 

“Of course I’ll be there, Wal- 
lace.” She added, lowering her 
voice to conspiratorial levels to 
let him know she knew; “What 
provisions have you made for 
pharmaceuticals?” 

His huge bulk heaved in relief. 
“Three marshals have keys to the 
drugstore pod. The druggist will 
lock up and leave at one o’clock.” 

T hough Lyn was ten minutes 
late to the office, Kley had not 
arrived. A methodical reader, he 
would scan the underground pa- 
per twice, once for the earthquake 
instructions and again for evi-

dence of a conspiracy. Without 
waiting for his instructions she 
went about preparing for an 
emergency conference, setting 
the switchboard in the front office 
to rotate the incoming calls to 
each girl in turn. 

“All personnel will be on the 
phones this morning,” she an- 
nounced. “All category-A offi- 
cials calling in will go on a listen 
and no-speak connection. Non- 
official calls for Doctor Kley will 
be given the ‘in conference, call 
back’ reply.” 

As the girls put away their rou- 
tine work and reached for their in- 
dividual call recorders Lyn went 
into her office and dialed Nils Lar- 
sen, knowing Amal would not an- 
swer. She caught Nils as he was 
leaving, fully dressed, a cigar 
protruding from his shirt pocket. 

“Nils, did Amal leave a mes- 
sage for me?” 

“He said join him in Uncle 
Moses’ country for the rock-and- 
roll session. He’ll be there at two 
o’clock today. Does that mean 
anything to you?” 

It meant he would meet her by 
the mill pond and she nodded. 
Amal had warned her to limit her 
conversations with Nils to busi- 
ness only, but his cigar intrigued 
her. Pleasantly, without being 
the least bit flirtatious, she said, “I 
didn’t know you smoked. Nils.” 

“I don’t.” He grinned. “Chemis- 
try gave me the cigar, imported 
from Madrid. Amal assigned me 
to the laser locker and it has a com- 
bination lock. This little cigar 
can blast open a bank vault.” 

“Then, for heaven’s sake, put it 
where it can’t be seen.” 



She hung up, connected the offi- 
cial stenographic recorder to the 
conference control board and be- 
gan to telephone the secretaries 
of the supervisors, telling them 
to stand by for a group confer- 
ence at ten. Most of the offices 
were manned by pro tern super- 
visors. Of the supervisors at the 
original earthquake hearing, Lyn 
found only Police Chief Jeffers, 
Supervisor of Public Safety, 
and Howebrand, of Spectacu- 
lars, on hand. After a moment’s 
deliberation she called the city at- 
torney’s office and the secretary 
of the Los Angeles commandant 
of the California Highway Pa- 
trol. 

She had alerted all concerned of- 
ficers when Dr. Kley appeared in 
her doorway. 

“Set up the emergency tele- 
phone procedure in the front of- 
fice and get the supervisors on the 
line for a conference. The agenda 
will cover the earthquake rumor 
and remedial measures for civil 
commotion. Better get the D.A. 
and the local commandant of the 
C.H.P. in on the proceedings.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

He turned to go, paused and 
turned back. “By the way, the 
registrar at Cal Tech called me 
Friday. He wanted me to find out 
on the q.t. who called Columbia, 
South Carolina from this office a 
week or ten days ago. Ask around 
when you get the time.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Honesty prompted her to an- 
swer immediately, as she would 
have done had he merely asked her 
who made the call, but the phrase 
“on the q.t.” alerted her. 



18 



GALAXY 




From her knowledge of govern- 
mental procedure she knew that 
someone had checked the Colum- 
bia archivist’s log and found her 
inquiry about Leroy Thatcher, a 
call she had made at the city’s ex- 
pense without personally identi- 
fying herself. But why would any- 
one at Cal Tech be interested in 
her interest in the frozen corpse 
of a racing driver dead almost 
two centuries? Had some experi- 
ment been performed which the 
medical schools wished kept 
secret? And was some nation-wide 
infrastructure of medical coun- 
ter-intelligence operating from 
the universities, seeking to warn 
her away from the area? 

Mulling a problem more imme- 
diate to her than earthquakes, she 
welcomed the diversion of flash- 
ing lights along the intercity con- 
ference board as she switched in 
the calls. Red and Amal had been 
right in holding her aloof from any 
conspiracy. She could do her job 
as a governmental employee un- 
hampered by guilt feelings and 
keep her mind free to ponder the 
curious relationship between a 
telephone call, a dead man whom 
Amal thought he remembered 
and Cal Tech where Amal studied. 

She leaned to the intercom and 
said, “Your conference is ready, 
Doctor Kley.’’ 

K LEY opened with a formal 
statement of the agenda and 
closed on an informal note: “I’m 
assuming the public will react to 
the rumor. Two-thirds of the 
board members who heard the orig- 
inal argument are out of the city 
and I’m planning a stroll in the

“Transportation here, Mr. 
Chairman. I can verify the as- 
sumption. For the past week 
there’s been a general exodus 
from the city and a decline in visi- 
tors.” 

“Transportation, order the rail- 
roads to suspend operations be- 
tween one and two tomorrow.” 

“City attorney here, Mr. Chair- 
man. Such an order would be a de 
facto endorsement of the rumor 
and leave the city open to time-lost 
suits.” 

“Transportation, couch your or- 
der in the form of a suggestion. 
Engineering, have crews stand-

gas lines to close them for emer- 
gency repairs at one-thirty to-

sunbaths — even if it’s raining. 
Chief Jeffers, what about your 
prisoners?” 

“I’ll have to leave them in the 
tower, Mr. Chairman. If you go 
along with this prediction I’ll 
need every man I’ve got to patrol 
the residential towers.” 

Kley was ignoring the flashing 
lights in front of him as various of- 
ficials asked for the floor. He 
plowed through the agenda, issu- 
ing precise instructions which re- 
flected his acceptance of Amal’s 
prediction. He was following 
Amal’s evacuation procedure, 
which would cost the city nothing 
but an extra effort on the part of 
its employees. Kley was not advo- 
cating an evacuation from the 
towers, merely preparing to as- 
sist those who wished to evacuate. 



Obviously he was gambling that 
public opinion would support 
him if the slightest temblor shook 
the city. As always, Lyn listened, 
fascinated by the give and take of 
the democratic process. 

Despite Kley’s ramrodding, it 
was eleven before the agenda 
reached the subject of crowd con- 
trol. In this area Kley yielded the 
floor to the California highway 
patrol’s local commander. 

“We’ll install the old pre-Holo- 
caust Sunday afternoon traffic 
directives to implement the mas- 
ter plan’s proposal for clearing 
the beach areas.” 

With wry amusement Lyn no- 
ticed that Amal’s plan had become 
“the master plan.” 

“Chief Jeffers here. Every cat 
burglar in Los Angeles is 
sharpening his claws over this 
scare. With eighty floors in each of 
the one hundred and ten empty 
towers to protect, plus riot con- 
trol on the ground, the police de- 
partment would like to offer a 
plan to squelch the rumor entire- 
ly.” Jeffers paused. A portentous 
rustle of paper alerted the con- 
ference to an important an- 
nouncement. “I’ve been author- 
ized by the U.S. State Depart- 
ment to announce that the earth- 
quake predicted by Amal Severn, 
a male Caucasian, aged twenty- 
two, is true in fact, though false in 
substance.” 

“What in hell has the state de- 
partment got to do with a Los An- 
geles earthquake?” Kley ex- 
ploded. 

“I don’t know,” the chief ad- 
mitted, “but here’s the official 
prediction. I’ll read it. ‘South of 



20 



GALAXY 




Victorville the San Andreas 
Fault jogs eastward. At that point 
the granite facings of the fault are 
permeated with iron ore, which 
creates a higher degree of bond- 
ing than the original equations 
consider. Fault displacement will 
occur at the hour predicted no 
farther south than the Victorville 
Intercept and will be felt in Los 
Angeles only as a minor tem- 
blor.’ And that’s what the state- 
ment says, Mr. Chairman.” 

“Chief, you and I know some- 
thing about announcements. If 
group-think can authorize a four 
point eight, then Severn can au- 
thorize a nine point five. Take 
your choice. Any prudent citizen 
would accept Severn’s figure and 
evacuate. I know. I’m a prudent 
citizen.” 

In the laughter following Kley’s 
quip Lyn thought: There is no 
medical school at Cal Tech . 

T he voice of Jeffers brought her 
back to the conference. 

“It has been suggested that the 
D. A. publicly offer Severn an 
arrangement: if he reports to the 
police before midnight, studies 
his own figures and admits his 
error, then he will be bound over in 
the tower to answer only to his 
non-capital offenses.” 

“The prediction’s now in the 
public domain, Chief. What’s he 
being sought for?” 

“Seven violations of the Stu- 
dents’ Restraining Act plus con- 
spiracy in the first degree. He 
bought the newsprint on which an 
unlicensed newspaper was pub- 
lished.” 

“If he recanted,” Kley pointed 



out, “the public would figure he 
was acting under duress.” 

“Not a chance. His honesty pro- 
file is too high.” 

“And what if he doesn’t re- 
port?” Kley asked. 

He would not report, Lyn knew. 
His earthquake phobia would 
prevent him, for he would know 
that he would be detained on the 
68th floor of the courthouse tower. 
Lyn’s growing anxiety rocketed 
to panic when Jeffers answered 
Kley’s question. 

“We’ll throw the book at him. 
As a stateless person he can be 
sentenced in absentia." 

“This is a police matter. Chief,” 
Kley pointed out. 

“No, Mr. Chairman. The 
department is requesting that a 
reward of twenty-five thousand 
dollars be posted. The fugitive’s 
hologram prefers the hunting 
preserve to the gas chamber. 
Without a reward, every sports- 
man in the city would be aiding 
and abetting to get the fugitive 
past the midnight deadline.” 

“Comptroller, what do you 
say?” Kley asked. 

“It’s a good wager, Mr. Chair- 
man. If he reports before mid- 
night, the city will lose the reward. 
If he doesn’t, the revenue accru- 
ing from the sale of hunting li- 
censes might top half a million.” 

“Very well. I’ll err on the side of 
humanity. Post the reward. 
Now, gentlemen, let’s consider 
the disposition of emergency ve- 
hicles.” 

More than the inhumanity, the 
casual indifference in the words 
shattered Lyn, undermining her 
confidence in the benignity of a

government which, as a matter 
of policy, could order a young 
man to his death in the moral 
equivalent of war. The “take” in 
the “give and take” of the demo- 
cratic process went mostly to the 
process servers, she thought. 

But why had Amal, with his bril- 
liance, signed for the newsprint on 
his green card? That idiocy was 
Red Benton’s fault — Red had 
failed to brief Amal properly on 
the vulnerability of a stateless 
person. Amal must not have 
known that first-degree conspir- 
acy was a felony established to 
permit the elimination of native 
radicals. All the chaos of history, 
its violence and the violent re- 
pression of violence, focused in 
one moment on Lyn’s mind and 
her thoughts were fragmented by 
the question: why had Amal 
signed for the newsprint? 

The voices on the phone were 
drifting from her, growing re- 
mote, lulling her with their sibi- 
lance. She seemed to be floating 
through the voids of her mind, re- 
laxed now, waiting for a sign. 

She felt the word “pemmican.” 

Amal had gone into the hunting 
preserve to get venison for pem- 
mican — venison for pemmican. 
She clung to the floating phrase, 
no longer anxious or even con- 
cerned, awaiting the revelation 
in the words. The void within her 
became gray, straited with dark- 
er, coiling maculations. From the 
grays grew hues and tints, forming 
the shapes of a vision. 

She went into a trance. 

S HE found herself standing at the 
San Fernando gate of the hunt- 



ing preserve watching Amal, bent 
under the weight of a small deer, 
emerge. He wore a mottled green 
and brown jacket with matching 
jeans. A Chamberlain sweatband 
bound his forehead beneath the 
mandatory red cap of the hunter. 
Laced around his ankles were the 
winter moccasins of the Iro- 
quois Indians. 

His longbow and sheath of ar- 
rows were missing. 

She knew this: on the day the 
hunters came for Amal they would 
face prey more familiar than they 
with the terrain of the killing 
ground. They would come seeking 
a camouflaged shadow that moved 
with moccasined stealth — and the 
hunters would become the prey of 
their quarry who would be armed 
with a silent and deadly longbow 
he had cached earlier among the 
canyons and boulders of the vast 
preserve. 

Red Benton had briefed Amal 
well. Amal had signed for the 
newsprint with the full knowledge 
that he might be apprehended 
and he had taken precautions. 

The focus of her psychic powers 
was blurring, the vision from the 
past fading, and she sent into the 
void from the conscious periphery 
of her thoughts the talismanic 
phrase, “sick eagle,” hoping to 
garner a glimpse of the future. 

Tiny and remote, as if viewed 
through the wrong end of a tele- 
scope, she saw the stanchion of a 
stripped tower slowly topple and 
fall. She herself was high among 
the griders of a naked tower and 
appalled by a fear for Amal some- 
where close at hand. Even as the 
vision faded she heard, clearly 



22

and inexplicably, a series of sharp 
reports followed by metallic 
clangs and rattles. 

She had seen enough to know 
that Amal’s prediction was more 
dreadfully accurate than his 
worst fears had assumed. At no 
time had he hinted that the stanch- 
ions themselves would fall. On the 
contrary, he had said repeatedly 
that the towers would stand, that 
only the modules would fall. 

Over the phones the voices grew 
clearer — the conference was end- 
ing. Lights began to flicker off on 
Lyn’s board and finally Kley’s 
voice came to her over the inter- 
com. 

“That’s it, Lyn. Wrap it up. And 
don’t think I’m tossing your boy 
friend to the lions. If one linkpin 
shears when the ground rolls to- 
morrow I’m granting him full 
amnesty.’’ 

At the moment the matter was 
academic in Lyn’s mind. Tomor- 
row there would be no Los An- 
geles left to grant Amal amnesty. 

But would the stanchions fall to- 
morrow? 

From the past she knew that her 
precognitions, though accurate, 
were often seen out of context of 
the full range of future events of 
which they were a segment. But 
Amal had been near her in the vis- 
ion, so he had escaped the hunt- 
ers of Angeles Crest. In the hyper- 
suggestibility of her post-trance 
period, it occurred to her that the 
popping sounds, aurally so well- 
defined in her trance, might have 
been the crack of rifles, the metal- 
lic clang and rattle that of bullets 
striking among the girders. 

It was almost one o’clock. Skip- 



ping lunch, she could reach the mill 
pond by two. She would tell Amal 
all that she had discovered. His 
analytical power, so much greater 
than her own, might solve the rid- 
dles'that perplexed her. 

Rapidly she began to remove 
and label the taped records of the 
conference, preparatory to fil- 
ing them. Efficiently she went 
about her tasks in the Service of a 
government with which she had 
grown disenchanted. 

VIII 

A mal had done well in choosing 
the historical village for his ref- 
uge, Lyn reflected, as she shim- 
mied into the cotton dress she had 
brought with her. His hologram 
would not be broadcast here. And 
here, too — in an era when law- 
men were treated lightly and the 
folk heroes were Pretty Boy Floyd 
and Clyde Barrow — he would 
find friends bold enough to con- 
ceal him. 

She put on high-heeled shoes, 
walked out of the station and cut 
across Lee’s Square toward Ham- 
burger Heaven. At the Confeder- 
ate monument she could see 
through the trees to the Essex 
parked before the hamburger 
stand and looked at her necklace 
watch. One-fifteen. Plenty of time 
to grab a bite before she drove out 
to meet Amal. 

Knowing that the local sheriff 
was kept posted on Los Angeles 
fugitives and would have the sta- 
tion area watched, Amal would not 
attempt to use the car. She sus- 
pected a student confederate 
would drive him to the San Bernar-

dino boundary of the compound 
and that he would come in over the 
fence from the north. 

The Emersons’ delight at see- 
ing her did as much to lift her 
spirits as the free ten-cent ham- 
burger and coffee did to lessen 
her hunger. They could afford the 
treat. Their business was doing so 
well they foresaw prosperity just 
around the corner. 

Insulated in the 1930s, they 
knew nothing of the turmoil in 
Los Angeles. Their questions 
about Amal she answered merely 
by saying that he was very active, 
that she and he were still planning 
to be married in Dotham next 
Sunday and that the government 
had confirmed Amal’s predic- 
tions of an earthquake. 

To her sadness Lyn learned 
from the old couple’s eyes that a 
rift had developed in their mar- 
riage. Emily had finally come into 
the open with her confession 
magazines. Reaffirming his 
commitment to science fiction, 
Vernon had grown caustic toward 
his wife’s lowbrow literary tastes 
and was lording it over her anony- 
mous writers by dropping the 
names — probably pseudonyms, 
if he only knew — of his own by- 
lined authors. Privately Lyn sided 
with Emily. The romantic tales 
might be fiction, but they ap- 
proached truth closely. 

Nostalgia was her excuse to the 
Emersons for her return to 
Dotham without Amal. Under 
different circumstances nostal- 
gia might indeed have given her a 
reason for her visit. Wheeling the 
Essex down the tree-arbored 
streets of Dotham, seeing again 



the white houses behind the green 
hedges and lawns, she grieved for 
her loss of innocence and passing 
Reb’s place she felt the pang of 
happiness remembered. 

Then she was driving the un- 
paved portion of the road, cross- 
ing the creek and parking as of old 
beside the Emersons’ hedge. As 
she swung down the path through 
the woods to the mill pond her 
throat ached with nostalgia. 

For a moment she stood on the 
bank. The pond was a placid sheet 
of water to a casual eye, but much 
more to a girl who in its waters 
had first been touched by the magic 
wand of love. Forcibly she turned 
her gaze away and followed the 
path toward the mill, the meadow 
and the hillcock, scene of the first 
and only consummation of her 
love for Amal. However brief that 
consummation, she was begin- 
ning to suspect it might be com- 
memorated by something more 
than a diamond ring and a prom- 
ise of marriage. 

Old Uncle Moses sat at his 
favorite spot, his bald head 
nodding over a fishing pole set in 
the bank. The serenity exuding 
from the ancient black was reas- 
suring to her after the swift pace 
changes in Los Angeles. In him was 
an unchanging simplicity. 

Rather than startle him, she 
called from ten yards away, “Any 
luck. Uncle Moses?’’ 

“No’m. Catfish ain’t biting 
yet. How’s y’all?’’ 

The phrase “y’all’’ impacted 
against her consciousness. No old 
darky who had spent his life in 
Dotham, Alabama, would use 
“y’all’’ to address one person.

Walking closer she looked down 
at him intently, deliberately 
burlesquing the dialect.' “I’s jes’ 
fine. Uncle Moses. How’s y’all?” 

He looked up at her smiling, but 
in the eye not covered by a cata- 
ract she saw a flash of alarm. She 
focused her gaze on his clear eye, 
studying it and the muscles of his 
face intently, knowing he would 
read her stare as hostile. She no 
longer cared. The time for social 
amenities was past. If Uncle 
Moses turned out to be an in- 
former both she and Amal were in 
danger — she for aiding and abet- 
ting a fugitive. 

With her post-trance sensitivity 
she read clearly a question Uncle 
Moses was asking himself: Hove I 
blown my cover? 



I F HE had a “cover” he was not 
an informer but an agent. Per- 
haps his cataract was made of fish 
skin. His head could be bald from 
shaving, its fringing hair dyed gray. 
She reproached herself for her past 
negligence. Weeks previously 
she had wondered about the surg- 
ing libido of a seventy-year-old 
man and then permitted herself 
to be distracted from her chain of 
thought. His lasciviousness, 
carefully considered, might have 
given her a clue to the conspiracy 
surrounding Amal. 

He was asking, “How’s Mr. 
Amal?” 

“He’s wanted by the law. Uncle 
Moses. There’s a reward of 
twenty-five thousand dollars 
posted for his apprehension.” 
“Whooeee! How you and him 
get married if he do time?” 



“We’re not getting married. 
I’m after the reward money.” 
“Looked to me, last time, like 
you sho’ loved'that white boy.” 
“Not twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars’ worth. Listen carefully. 
Uncle Moses, and you can get 
some of that money for yourself. 
Amal’s coming to meet me. As 
soon as you see him you amble 
down the creek, cut over to Reb’s 
Place and have Reb telephone the 
sheriff. I’ll coax Amal over for a 
barbecue sandwich. If the sher- 
iffs waiting to arrest him you’ve 
made yourself five dollars.” 

The old man considered her 
proposal, looking out toward the 
cork on the end of his line. 

When he spoke his voice had lost 
its quaver and two centuries had 
dropped from his manner. Sud- 
denly the humble, twentieth-cen- 
tury “darky” was a modern U.S. 
African, alert and imperious. 

“Don’t concern yourself with 
methods for the suspect’s cap- 
ture, Miss Oberlin, and don’t try 
to con me away from here so he 
can escape. The area is sur- 
rounded. If you cooperate with 
the arresting officers I’ll see that 
you get your share of the reward.” 
“Cooperate how?” 

Since he would see that she got 
her “share of the reward” Uncle 
Moses was a man of authority. He 
had said “the arresting officers” 
instead of “us,” so he was not a 
policeman. 

“Walk to the top of the hill and 
look around — as if you were 
waiting and anxious.” 

Only one other person had 
known she and Amal were meet- 
ing here. She would share the re- 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

ward for Amal’s capture with his 
roommate. Nils Larsen. 

“Who are you?” she asked the 
African, openly staring now. 

“Never mind who I am. Just get 
on the hill. Stay there until the po- 
lice tell you it’s over.” 

But she had read his answer be- 
fore she turned to comply. “Uncle 
Moses” was an operative of the 
Eugenics Surveillance Agency. 

She had never heard of the 
Eugenics Surveillance Agency, 
but whatever else it did it cer- 
tainly hired actors as operatives. 
Looking down at Uncle Moses as 
she walked up the hill, she saw that 
he was slumped back into his 
nodding posture, for all the world 
an old-fashioned darky enjoying 
a fishing outing. His bald head 
gleaming in the sunlight re- 
minded her of Amal’s remark 
Uncle Moses would not have to get 
his head shaved to join the Skin- 
heads on the Fort Tejon Reserva- 
tion. 

She had not paid close enough 
attention to Nils’ words, as Amal 
had instructed her, but for once 
she had profited from her error. 
Amal had not wanted her here, but 
on the Skinhead Reservation. 
Still, Nils was definitely one of 
“them.” After she had spent the 
time required of her here on the 
hill, growing more and more anx- 
ious about Amal, she would spend 
the rest of the afternoon calling 
on Nils Larsen at Cal Tech. He 
knew the secret of Amal’s iden- 
tity and would know why the De- 
partment of Experimental Genet- 
ics was intent on eliminating 
Amal. 

Tomorrow — if Amal escaped 



capture today — she would drive 
out the Ridge Route after a rou- 
tine day’s work at the office, drop 
from the guide band and be with 
Amal on the Skinhead Reserva- 
tion when the earthquake struck. 
There at least he was safe from the 
authorities. He would not be dis- 
tinguishable from any chance 
supplicant for admission to the 
sect and, in his religious fervor 
against the gods of technology. 
Brother Kiefer would not permit 
even a transistor radio on the re- 
servation. 



I T WAS characteristic of Amal’s 
lack of infatuation with status 
that he had never once mentioned 
to her that his apartment was on 
the 67th floor, only one level be- 
low the faculty residences, and she 
felt the irony of her position as the 
elevator rose. Engaged to one of 
the most eligible bachelors in 
Pasadena, she had never entered 
his pod. Now, during the dating 
hours, she was calling unan- 
nounced on the roommate he had 
wanted her to avoid. 

In a way the police had done her 
a favor by holding her, as a law- 
abiding citizen, on the mound un- 
til three-thirty as a lure for Amal. 
They had delayed her call on Nils 
until slightly after four o’clock 
when she could arrive inconspic- 
uously with other incoming fe- 
males, while all males were se- 
questered in their rooms, doors 
open, awaiting whatever “date” 
chose to enter. 

Cal Tech, she observed, was no 
U.S.C. during the period called 
by students “Sadie Hawkins’

time.” Her elevator was far from 
being crowded. Three very young 
girls in the blue uniforms of Mary- 
mount High School, all giggling 
and twittering over their lark, 
were riding to the freshman’s 
level. An older platinum blonde 
with the bored hauteur of a demi- 
rep had punched the 80th floor but- 
ton — the topmost level reserved 
for Nobel Prize winners. 

Apartment number 6701 was 
directly across the rotunda from 
the elevator. Before she stepped 
into the music-flooded corridor 
Lyn saw the door was closed. Al- 
ready Nils had scored. She might 
have expected it. He was a native 
of nearby Covina, blond and 
handsome, and not every girl 
shared Lyn’s distaste for trite 
metaphors. 

His date introduced compli- 
cations in Lyn’s plan of attack, 
but she remembered the slogan 
of the sex hour — two’s company; 
three’s a party — and pushed the 
doorbell. She waited, listening to 
the beckoning music from the 
open doors around the circular 
corridor. A full minute passed 
before the startled face of Nils ap- 
peared at the door window. 

“Lyn!” 

“How are you, Nils?” 

“Well, er, at the moment tak- 
ing a bath.” His voice dropped. 
“Amal’s not hiding here.” 

“I know it. Nils. I’ve come to 
double your pleasure, double your 
fun.” 

He smiled at her cliche and his 
voice rose an octave. 

“I’m alone, Lyn. Wait a mo- 
ment until I slip into a bathrobe.” 

From the corner of her eyes, she 



saw a young man peer from an 
open doorway farther around the 
circle. He grew slightly bug-eyed 
and called loudly to her, “Lyn 
Oberlin — in the flesh.” 

She waved and smiled at him, 
flattered that he should remem- 
ber her name. It had been months 
since the Scientists and Models 
Ball. 

Then the whistling began, even 
from the doorways beyond her 
vision, drowning the music with 
luring sibilance, and Nils seemed 
to be taking an interminable 
time to towel himself and throw 
on a robe. Feeling sympathy for 
all female mynah birds caught in 
the middle during mating rites, 
she called over the sound, “Back to 
your holes, moles. Tm not your 
earth mother.” 

Laughter greeted her sally and 
the whistling was dying when Nils 
opened the door. Lyn closed the 
door firmly behind her. 

“How are you. Nils?” 

“Then you didn’t come to see 
Amal?” 

“No. You. When the cat’s away 
the rats may play.” 

Her words held a Freudian slip. 
He failed to notice — but Lyn was 
noticing much. They were stand- 
ing in the reception alcove and 
the door to the bedroom on her 
left was slightly ajar. The bed was 
mussed and Nils hair was dry. His 
first thought when he opened the 
door had been clear and strong 
enough for her to catch at a glance: 
/ hope she doesn't ask to use the 
bathroom. 

“You’re sure you don’t have a 
date?” she insisted, knowing that 
he did — and with surely the

world’s most modest girl, one 
hiding in the bathroom. 

“No, I’ve been working all af- 
ternoon.” He escorted her into a 
living room where her feet sank 
inches into a Persian carpet — 
handwoven, no doubt. Near the 
window a long leather sofa, 
fronted by a massive ebony coffee 
table and chairs, had been placed 
to catch the view to the southwest. 
To the right was a bar. “May I of- 
fer you a drink?” 

Nils turned to her as he asked 
and she could tell that his still frag- 
mented thoughts held a high 
libidinal content. Very good. Her 
plan was to encourage such ex- 
pectations. 

“Please. Scotch and soda.” She 
strode to the window to look out 
as he hurried to the bar. “What a 
lovely view. Nils.” 

“Yes. On a clear day you can see 
Catalina.” 

S HE would huild up his hopes, 
she decided, and when he was 
keyed to the proper pitch she would 
snap his string. In the resulting 
emotional chaos his most 
guarded thoughts might surface 
and she would do her best to fol- 
low whatever leads he gave her to 
their source. 

She turned as he approached 
with a tray bearing drinks. 
“Where do you want me to sit. 
Nils?” 

Flustered, he splashed their 
drinks slightly as he tried to put 
down the tray and point to the sofa 
simultaneously. 

“My, what a clumsy Ganymede 
you are,” she chided him. “Give it 
to me, Nils — the tray.” 



Smiling sheepishly he handed 
her the dampened tray and asked, 
“What’s a Ganymede?” 

“A Greek god, cupbearer to 
Zeus.” 

“Was he something like 
Apollo?” 

“Much more handsome. Apol- 
lo was to Ganymede what Loki 
was to Siegfried.” 

Indubitably, among the girls 
who would be attracted to Nils 
Larsen, many would have com- 
pared him to Siegfried. Her allus- 
ion should not go unnoticed. 

She took the tray to the bar, 
swabbed it dry with a few deft cir- 
cles of the bar cloth, letting her 
movements carry to her thighs. 
When she turned back he was 
standing, watching her, his robe 
loose. 

She pointed to the end of the 
sofa as she handed him a napkin 
and ordered, “Down, boy. Sit!” 

She took her drink to the oppo- 
site end of the sofa, sat and arched 
back luxuriantly into the leather. 

“Here’s to you and yours,” he 
said, lifting his glass. 

She raised hers. He was re- 
sponding to her body language, 
but still strangely anxious about 
the girl in the bathroom. Prob- 
ably some Cal Tech coed had 
dropped in and Nils was ashamed 
of the I.Q. freak, which only 
proved him as unperceptive as 
pretentious. It should be obvious 
to him — from Amal — that she, 
too, preferred intellectuals. 

From sheer gossipy interest she 
was tempted to probe his thoughts 
about the girl, but her depth scan- 
ning would have to await more ser- 
ious concerns.

“Did you meet Amal?” 

“No. One of your boys from Eu- 
genics Surveillance got there be- 
fore I did and Amal must have seen 
him first.” 

It would have taken no mind- 
reader to translate the quizzical 
glance Nils threw at her. It asked 
an outright question: how did a 
psychologist learn about the 
Eugenics Surveillance Agency? 

“I never heard of the agency,” 
he said. 

He lied with the same skill he 
served drinks, she thought, re- 
membering the rumpled bed, his 
dry hair and now his use of the 
word “agency” which she had 
avoided. 

“I didn’t mean yours person- 
ally,” she said. “I meant the genet- 
ics department’s agency. Though 
it does seem strange that your man 
was there, with members of the 
LAPD, when no one knew about 
the meeting but Amal and me — 
and you.” 

“He never told me where you 
were meeting,” Nils reminded her. 
“All he mentioned was ‘Moses’ 
country!” 

He turned his gaze from her, 
looking through the window, and 
she focused on his profile, the lines 
of his body, catching the pertur- 
bations of a mind torn between 
friendship and a sense of duty. 
Duty to what, to whom, she won- 
dered, as his first clear thought 
came to her: What went wrong at 
the stakeout? 

After the thought she caught his 
sense of relief. At least he had a 
remnant of conscience, she de- 
cided, and attacked his guilt 
feelings. 



“But he had told you about 
Moses earlier^ — ” her voice flooded 
with anger — “and for a few pieces 
of silver you sold the man who is 
risking his life to save yours.” 

“He won’t be killed— ” 

He saw the anger in her eyes and 
the sentence continued only in 
his mind: . by the hunters. 
When they come for him they will 
be moving in stow motion . 

“His reflexes are too fast,” he 
finished aloud. 

“His reflexes failed him once,” 
she said, concentrating on his 
eyes, “on the seventh lap of the 
John C. Calhoun Raceway.” 

Black file date! 

S HE caught the thought streak- 
ing through his mind on a laser 
pulse of alarm — and she admired 
the self-control that allowed him 
to say calmly, “He never men- 
tioned to me any failure on any 
race course.” 

“Come now,” she said deliber- 
ately, tensing ail her receptors 
and focusing on his thoughts. 
“Surely you’ve learned from the 
black file that Leroy Thatcher was 
killed.” 

It was then his control left him. 
Stupefaction showed on his face. 
His thoughts shattered, the frag- 
ments striking against her in bits 
and pieces. Some lodged like live 
coals in her brain. 

Where did she learn about the 
black files? Amal? No . some 
other method . telepathy? It

merits failed. There are no mind- 
readers. Witchcraft , then . 
guard my thoughts. She's staring 
at me . make her look some- 
where else . her mind’s burning 
me . 

Lyn, herself shaken, looked 
away, focusing her attention on a 
painting of a Saracen knight on 
the wall behind him. 

She had come seeking know- 
ledge only of Amal’s origins, and 
.from the mind of this geneticist 
had rolled secrets pointing to a 
solution of her own mysteries. 
Obviously there had been an at- 
tempt to breed psychic sensitives 
and Nils Larsen, aware of such ex- 
periments, carried in his mind 
psychic arcana of which she was 
unaware. “Bioplasmatic recep- 
tors” and “parametric waves” 
were terms unknown to her, but 
Nils Larsen evidently had been 
trained to look for such phe- 
nomena. 

Walk carefully around this 
man, her mind cautioned her even 
as her memory Hashed back to the 
disappointed parapsychologist 
of her childhood. No doubt the 
man had been a member of the 
Eugenics Surveillance Agency 
and by a ruse she had escaped ob- 
servation. They believed the “psi 
experiments had failed — ” or so 
Heywood had told Nils. 

The name Heywood stirred in 
her memory, but she could not 
place it. 

Nils, composed now, was 
asking, “What did Amal tell you 
about this Leroy Thatcher?” 

Suspicious, sensing the powers 
of adversary and probably aware 
that he could guard his thoughts ef- 



fectively by such simple strata- 
gems as adding a column of figures 
in his mind or counting backward. 
Nils was now taking the offen- 
sive. He was seeking less to deter- 
mine what she knew, she sus- 
pected, than to discover how much 
of her information came from 
Amal. 

“You forget I’m Amal’s con- 
sulting psychologist,” she said. 
“What he tells me is privileged.” 

“Then you probably know more 
about him than I do — so why 
come to me?” 

He was definitely seeking in- 
formation and it would be point- 
less to attempt to read his 
thoughts while his defenses were 
alerted. Her best chance for break- 
ing through to his knowledge, she 
realized, would come if she could 
force him to a crisis of conscience. 
His guilt feelings might be her 
greatest ally. 

“Tve come to let you know that 
I know you’ve sold a friend and 
fellow student for blood money. 
Of all who know where Amal is, 
with his hologram being broadcast 
constantly, the only one who came 
forward to claim the reward was 
his doting and obsequious room- 
mate. I imagine your parent is 
proud of her son.” 

“Rest your mind on that score,” 
he said, stirring uneasily. “I 
wouldn’t have taken a penny.” 

I NTUITIVELY she knew he 
spoke the truth. 

“Then why did you inform on 
him?” 

“Amal’s not what you think, 
Lyn.” He turned to her. “I did 
what Amal would have done —

voluntarily — if he understood the 
patterns of his fate as well as I. 
Lyn, stay away from him. Leave 
Los Angeles. He’s the danger. 
Not the earthquake. To you and 
me — to himself — he’s everything 
he seems to be, brave, generous, 
unselfish. But get out — out of Los 
Angeles — tonight, while there’s 
time.” 

“You’re gibbering,” she 
snapped. 

“I wish to God I were. But I’ve 
already told you more than I’m 
cleared to talk about. I’m sorry, 
Lyn, but I’m asking you to leave. 
Please go.” 

“All right.” She stood up. He 
was weakening. She could still 
force his conscience to a crisis. 
She was standing close to the bed- 
room door and the floor plans of 
all apartment modules were stan- 
dard. Through the door and across 
the bedroom was the bathroom. 
“All right. I’ll leave, you Judas,” 
she said. “But your stench has 
made me sick. I’m going to throw 
up.” 

She whirled and flung open the 
door, seeing him rise too slowly 
to stop her. She was across the 
bedroom, noticing the two beds, 
one mussed, before Nils could 
stumble after her, calling “Don’t 
go in there!” 

The strained hoarseness in his 
voice reminded her of a yelping 
seal. She slammed the bathroom 
door and clicked the lock. 

At first glance the bathroom 
appeared unoccupied, but a vague 
shadow behind the opaque plastic 
of the shower panel revealed Nils’ 
guest’s hiding place. Lyn slid back 
the panel and stood breast-to- 



breast with herself standing regally 
in the shower stall, stark naked 
except for the pendant watch 
draped around her neck. 

For a moment Lyn was frac- 
tured between laughter and in- 
dignation, but a few shards of her 
feelings consisted of outright ad- 
miration for the artifact in front 
of her. The boys of the Daedalus 
Society might have taken the orig- 
inal’s measurements — all of them — 
with calipers, so exact was the 
replica. 

They’ve made, my lips too full, 
she thought, nitpicking, and my 
eyes are a shade too green. 

“What’s your name?” she asked 
the gynodrone. 

Focusing its eyes on the sound 
of her voice, wetting its lips and 
answering with a huskiness deeper 
than her own, it answered, “Lyn 
Oberlin.” 

“How dare you use my name, 
you simpering whore?” 

Her shriek was designed to car- 
ry through the door to Nils Lar- 
sen in the bedroom and she was 
forced to mute a note of triumph 
in her squeal. The patterns of Nils’ 
fate had presented her with an op- 
portunity to squash him without 
resorting to mindreading. She had 
almost caught him in the act of 
making love to a plastic replica 
of herself. 

She swept back into the bed- 
room to find Nils sitting on the 
edge of the mussed bed, his head 
in his hands, looking down at the 
floor. 

Standing in front of him, look- 
ing down on the top of his head, 
she lashed him with her voice. 
“Hiring that gynodrohe leaves you

open to invasion-of-privacy 
charges. After today I’m not 
above airing your solitary prac- 
tices in court. What would your 
girl friend in Covina think of a 
Romeo who could only score with 
a plastic dummy? Did Amal know 
you were renting this thing? Or 
were you turning him in to get him 
out of the room? Look at me!” 

His ego, completely crushed, 
had readied him for interrogation. 
He lifted stricken eyes. 

“What do you want from me? 
Why did you come?” 

She asked, “Who’s Heywood?” 
“The head of the genetics de- 
partment,” he said. 

“Is he qualified to tell me about 
Amal?” 

“Yes.” 

“Where is he?” 

“On the seventy-ninth floor.” 
Behind her she saw a trail lit- 
tered with missed opportunities. 
She should have remembered Hey- 
wood and his should have been 
the mind to burn with her ques- 
tions. Moreover, she should have 
briefed herself on his background. 
His residence on the 79th floor in- 
dicated that he had been nomin- 
ated for a Nobel Prize, so he 
would be listed in Who’s Who. 

“Get your clothes on,” she 
snapped. “Then telephone the head 
warlock of your coven. Tell him 
you’re bringing Lyn Oberlin up 
to interview him on Amal Severn. 
He’ll know my name. He’s already 
been snooping around my office. 
Tell him anything you wish — but 
you’d better persuade him. Other- 
wise, lover boy, your plastic sweet- 
heart will become public knowl- 
edge.” 



“Heywood’s not what you think 
he is,” Nils muttered, looking 
again down at the carpet as he 
stood up. 

“I’ll draw my own conclusions,” 
she said brusquely. 

S HE had used a shameful com- 
bination of blackmail and bully- 
ing on Nils, she later admitted to 
herself, and enjoyed every minute 
of it. As a social psychologist, 
she knew that students in Nils’ 
category frequently preferred gyn- 
odrones over live girls as lesser 
hazards to concentration — and in 
retrospect she was more flattered 
than indignant over finding her 
replica on campus. 

Dr. Heywood lived alone in a 
double pod, richly but quietly fur- 
nished. He greeted them in the en- 
trance alcove with the gracious- 
ness of a host receiving guests, 
saying to Lyn, “I’m truly sorry. 
Miss Oberlin, that you should ar- 
rive at this hour with a male es- 
cort.” 

Superficially he was suave, 
charming, seemingly gentle. 
Though slightly built and no taller 
than Lyn, his air of authority 
made him seem taller. She noted 
a sensitive, almost poetic quality 
to his widely spaced blue eyes 
whose color matched the tints in 
his wavy gray hair. Distinguished 
looking, almost handsome, the 
formalism of his appearance — his 
trimmed hair, business suit and 
white shirt — indicated that he iden- 
tified with students. His only con- 
cession to his fifty-odd years was 
a flaring Windsor knot in his neck- 
tie. 

Bowing, he ushered them into 



32 



GALAXY 




his office, apologizing for his mild 
witticism. “Of course, I jest. An 
aging swan can only dream of Le- 
dean bodies.’’ 

His wistful, Yeatsian metaphor 
alone, comparing her to Leda, 
would have attracted her and the 
burden of regret it carried touched 
her sympathies. In the office he 
took her chair and arranged it to 
take full advantage of the view 
through the window of San Jacin- 
to far to eastward, its snow-capped 
summit ensalmoned by the late 
afternoon sunlight. He held her 
chair until she was seated, a bit of 
old-fashioned gallantry she found 
endearing. 

“I fell under your spell yester- 
day, Miss Oberlin,” he confessed 
as he passed behind his mahogany 
desk to seat himself, “while you 
watched Red Benton thrash the 
Gorgeous One in defense of aca- 
demic freedom. It was then, see- 
ing what beauty and talent had al- 
lied itself with Amal, that I de- 
cided, reluctantly — and I want to 
make it very clear that it was re- 
luctantly — to call in outside au- 
thority to influence Amal’s fate.’’ 

“Doctor Heywood, for the sec- 
ond time in this hour I’ve heard 
Amal’s fate mentioned. What is 
his fate? What has Leroy Thatch- 
er to do with it and how did the 
state department get involved in 
it?’’ 

Heywood threw up his hands 
in self-defense and peeked from 
behind them, smiling. 

“Gentle woman, please. I’ll at- 
tempt to answer all questions, but 
space them. First, Amal’s fate.” 

He lowered his hands to his desk 
and drummed its polished surface 



lightly with manicured nails. He 
was gathering his thoughts. 

“As a psychologist you know 
that many behaviorists maintain 
there is no random human be- 
havior, that even an impulse to 
rise and get a drink of water is 
predestined, preordained. Shake- 
speare wrote that our fate is not 
in the stars but in ourselves. The 
truth goes deeper. Our fate is not 
in ourselves but in our genes.” 

His voice trailed a little sadly 
into the final admission, but it 
suddenly changed timbre. He tilted 
his head upward and his eyes 
glowed with an inner exaltation. 

“Man’s fate — the orchestrations 
of his genes. From life’s primal 
matter we geneticists compose 
arias, symphonies. Ambulatory 
Eugenic Experiment Number Sev- 
en was to have been our supreme 
creation in the lyric mode, de- 
rived from a motif designed to 
counterpoint triumphantly the dis- 
sonances of the population sink. 
The theme of Amal Eugene Sev- 
ern was this — he was to be the 
prototype of the ideal man for a 
crowded planet, a short movement 
rising to an unforgettable climax.” 
He paused and in the pause Lyn 
realized a poet was speaking, a 
master lecturer known in the par- 
lance of students as a “snowman.” 
She leaned forward. 

“I have a secret to tell you, 
M iss Oberlin. 

I T WAS good that she had asked 
three questions before he started. 
For the next twenty minutes she 
was mesmerized by his flowing, 
allusive speech and his facial ex- 
pression, now intent, now with-

drawn, smiling quickly, quickly 
serious. 

Ambulatory Eugenic Experi- 
ment Seven was begun before the 
Holocaust solved the population 
problem, he told her. 

“Newspapers rationed to four 
pages because of the declining sup- 
ply of wood pulp carried stories 
predicting a ninety-year active 
life span. More people were liv- 
ing longer, consuming more, con- 
tributing less to an age of glut- 
tonous sloths blindly procreating. 
In the year two thousand twenty- 
four an unidentified U.N. spokes- 
man tendered a sub rosa offer to 
a world congress of geneticists — 
money would be available for ex- 
periments to limit population and 
increase the supply of contributing 
inhabitants by morally acceptable 
means. 

“Ah, dear lady, how could hu- 
man life be made shorter and 
more fruitful by morally accepta- 
ble means?” 

“As is not unusual in such mat- 
ters the geneticists received as- 
sistance from an unforeseen 
source. An actuarian wrote an ar- 
ticle in an insurance journal de- 
scribing ten generations of an 
English family in which every male 
died accidentally before the age 
of twenty-six. The actuarian sug- 
gested that the so-called ‘death 
wish’ might be inheritable. 

“One of our boys ran across 
the article, took a computer read- 
out on the actuarial statistics at 
Hartford and verified the actuari- 
an’s hunch. DNA samples were 
taken of the accident prone, of 
all who died accidentally while 
young — suicides, trapeze artists. 



racing drivers. Millions of macro- 
holograms were made of the cell 
tissues. Out of the maze of charts, 
diagrams and configurations a 
consistent anomaly arose, a warp 
in the helix of neural DNA. The 
Thanatos Syndrome Factor was 
isolated. Through breeding and 
by foetal implants we felt we 
could solve, in a morally accep- 
table manner, the planet’s popu- 
lation crisis. 

“We were not playing God but 
using our intellects. Who is to say 
what determines good breeding? 
The Adamses? The Jukes? The 
Kallikaks? Or shall reasonable, 
hard-pressed men of good will for- 
feit the decision to two fumbling 
teenagers in the rear of an auto- 
mobile? 

“Why continue such an experi- 
ment after the Holocaust struck 
and the need for it had passed, a 
delightfully intent young woman 
might ask. Simple inertia. We 
had to climb Annapurna because 
it was there, its virginal snowcrest 
gleaming.” 

Amal had been well bred for his 
purpose. He was the product of 
the ovum of a distinguished poet- 
ess who was a suicide at twenty, 
inseminated by the sperm of a 
mathematician who had contrib- 
uted to unified field mathematics 
before his death in a plane crash, 
following family tradition, at the 
age of twenty-three. Amal’s fore- 
brain had been further enriched by 
foetal cloning of Leroy Thatcher’s 
neural tissue in a uterine opera- 
tion. 

The cloning was an error of 
commission, Heywood admitted: 
“Leroy’s neural DNA was rich 



34 



GALAXY 




with the Thanatos gene — seven 
generations of Thatcher males 
died at the age of twenty-one.” 

It seemed that the pre-patterned 
DNB from the cryogenic corpse 
cast shadows along Amal’s neural 
paths. Still, the auto racer had 
added a charming, devil-may-care 
nonchalance to Amal’s personality. 

H EYWOOD made the experi- 
ment seem so rational, so nec- 
essary and so truly humanitarian 
that Lyn ceased to think of Amal 
as the man she loved and began to 
regard him solely as AE 7 — Am- 
bulatory Eugenic Experiment 
Number Seven. She was commis- 
erating with Heywood over the 
defects hindsight revealed in the 
experiment when one of his re- 
marks wrenched her back to sub- 
jectivity. 

‘‘Nature has her own logic 
which at times defeats us — even 
defeats nature. Foredoomed to a 
short lifespan, moved at a faster 
pace by its higher frequency brain 
waves, the new species — homo 
ultra sapiens, I suppose we should 
have called it — was apparently 
protected by high sexual potency. 
An unwed Spanish gypsy is bring- 
ing suit against the University of 
Madrid for child support, and a 
South African black girl is in jail 
for violation of apartheid. We 
erred in that our anti-sex condi- 
tioning was not strong enough — 
vasectomies would have been sur- 
er. 

‘‘But nature erred in the speci- 
mens’ overkill capabilities. Far 
from behing the ‘ideal man for a 
crowded planet,’ one generation 
of the species would have depopu- 



lated a planet the size of Saturn, 
leaving only the birds and beetles. 
So — our Ambulatory Experiment 
Number Seven will soon be filed 
with our failures.” 

Thrashing out of the snowbank, 
Lyn asked, “After Amal dies?” 

“Not necessarily,” Heywood 
shook his head. “After we discov- 
er if he has been defused or not. I 
will call on outside authorities on- 
ly to reapply psychic pressure re- 
leased when he made his contribu- 
tion to science. With his host of 
loyal fellow students — I’m sure 
there’s not another turncoat 
among them — to guard him and 
with his quickness of mind and 
physical reactions, I doubt if he’ll 
be apprehended by the police un- 
less he wishes to be. In that event 
he’ll be placed immediately into 
another pressure cooker. 

“If we can keep his lid on tight- 
ly enough, occupy him with sur- 
rogate obsessions until his love 
for you erodes his death wish — 
I think we all may be safe from 
his Doomsday Gene.” 

“Then you think Amal has a 
chance to avoid his fate?” 

“At least fifty-fifty. We have a 
young school administrator in 
Hamburg, Germany, who is hap- 
pily married and pregnant with 
twins. You see, Miss Oberlin, we 
keep a close watch on our sub- 
jects. My fear is that Amal will 
have already set in motion the 
machinery for riots and destruc- 
tion when Little Palmdale strikes. 
But we’ll know tomorrow. All 
AE Sevens die in the cataclysms 
they create.” 

He smiled at Lyn. “After the 
crisis, I can assure you, a living

Amal will be granted amnesty as 
a public benefactor. I hope to see 
you again next Sunday. Even if 
I’m not invited to the wedding I 
may slip into a back pew at Doth- 
am Baptist just to see you in your 
wedding gown.” 

He arose and extended his hand 
in farewell. Gratefully she arose 
and accepted it, saying, “I’ll see 
that you get an invitation. Doctor 
Heywood, but I have one more 
question. What happened to 
Amal’s creche mother?” 

“Poor lady,” he sighed. “She 
believes her favorite son was killed 
in a bus crash.” His face bright- 
ened and he added: “On your hon- 
eymoon you might visit her in 
Iran.” 

“I have a question. Doctor 
Heywood.” Nils spoke for the 
first time. “Since Lyn knows 
about AE Seven, will Amal’s 
genetic card by reclassified from 
top secret?” 

Heywood was vexed. “Of 
course Lyn will keep our secret. 
Would any girl tell the boy she 
loves that he’s a pastiche, an ar- 
tificial man, a thing of bits and 
patches? Certainly not Lyn. Even 
if he dies tomorrow she’ll not dis- 
honor his memory. After all, we 
still must consider the Puritan 
ethic and Lyn is too loyal to 
spread canards about the boy.” 

H eywood was so right, Lyn 
thought, as they bade the doc- 
tor good evening and exited into 
the corridor. 

“What did you think of him?” 
Nils asked. 

“He’s overwhelming,” she said, 
thinking: I shall tell Amal about 



his creche mother on our wedding 
day . 

“I’m beginning to think differ- 
ently about him myself,” Nils 
said. “This morning he thanked 
this ‘turncoat’ for giving him the 
exact time you were supposed to 
meet Amal in Dotham, which was 
already staked out. 

“My dad used to be a sales- 
man,” Nils continued, as if talk- 
ing to himself. “He told me how 
he used to feel after the sales man- 
ager gave all the salesmen a pep 
talk early in the morning. They 
would go out feeling they could 
sell a million dollars worth, but as 
soon as they hit the sidewalk it 
was the same old street.” 

A strong note of dissent in Nils’ 
opinion aroused her critical facul- 
ties — which, she realized, Hey- 
wood’s personality had numbed. 

“He did seem to be wearing 
blinders. Something was missing 
in his arguments.” 

“Honesty,” Nils said, punch- 
ing the elevator button viciously. 
And her appreciation of Nils 
climbed as he continued to mut- 
ter. “They lied to Amal. They lied 
to his creche mother. They condi- 
tioned him to fear earthquakes 
through lies, then manipulated 
him into coming to a school which 
practically straddles the San An- 
dreas Fault. In the seismo lab — 
every time the damned needle wav- 
ered Amal bolted for the door. 
Talk about free will. He has as 
much control over his fate as a 
rat has over its maze. He’s more 
conspired against than conspir- 
ing.” 

Still muttering as they stepped 
into the elevator. Nils said, “I tell 



36 



GALAXY 




you this — my name may be mud 
with you, but if the pods fall to- 
morrow I’ll be waiting on the 
ground with a laser torch to burn 
Amal’s card from the black files 
and present it to you as a wedding 
present. It’s the only master card. 
It’s microfilmed in Switzerland, 
but no one could find the film 
without the number on the card.” 
“Why not take all the files?” 
“What would I do with them?” 
She felt she might have a per- 
sonal interest in the files but didn’t 
wish to tell Nils. 

“I don’t know,” she answered, 
“but Red Benton would know. 
May I call him from your apart- 
ment. Perhaps we three could have 
dinner together.” 

“Do you mean you’re willing 
to return to my apartment?” 

She laughed aloud at the in- 
credulity in his voice and con- 
fessed, “Of course. Nils. I might 
even use your bathroom. I 
wouldn’t think of bringing charges 
against you — unless I catch you 
running around with some other 
gynodrone.” 

Her call reached Red Benton 
alone in his room. He complained 
that the allegations of an impend- 
ing earthquake had ruined Sadie 
Hawkins. Lyn's invitation to din- 
ner to discuss “an important de- 
velopment concerning Amal” 
found him eager to accept. 

He suggested they meet at the 
Steak-Out, a restaurant atop the 
courthouse frequented by police- 
men. The patrons were people who 
respected privacy. The Steak-Out 
also had facilities for projecting 
Amal’s “wanted” hologram live. 
In the rush of her day Lyn had not 



seen the hologram, though it had 
been shown every hour since noon. 
Red wanted her to see that even 
the police were not above editor- 
ializing in a five-minute all points 
bulletin. 



T hey met in the lobby of the 
restaurant and had no trouble 
finding a table adjacent to the tele- 
vision stage. Off-duty policemen 
were bored by a hologram most 
had memorized earlier and which 
was fading from the platform as 
the waiter led Lyn’s trio to seats. 

Still inhibited by his profession- 
al attitudes toward secrecy. Nils 
let Lyn explain the black f'Ics to 
Red and recount in detail her 
conversation with Dr. Heywood 
concerning the genetic experiment 
and the unforeseen destructiveness 
of the Doomsday Gene. So strong 
was the charisma Heywood had 
cast over her thoughts that she 
found herself justifying AE 7 to 
the intent lawyer. 

Red did not accept Heywood’s 
position. 

“What you’ve outlined,” he 
said, “is a crime against humani- 
ty. The governments of Spain, 
Russia and South Africa are crim- 
inally liable before the World 
Court for connivance in this ex- 
periment which, apart from inhu- 
man aspects, constitutes mass 
murder. More to the point, each 
government has opened itself to 
a class action for damages on the 
part of the dependent survivors 
of the victims.” 

He turned to Nils. 

“If you’re willing to provide me 
with hard evidence I’ll see that it's 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



37 




used without prejudice to you and 
to your financial advantage. If 
any catastrophe results from 
Amal’s behavior — even as a prox- 
imate cause — I can bring a class 
action that will end experimenta- 
tion with human lives now and 
forever.” 

“I’m thinking of Amal,” Lyn 
pointed out. “Both Kley and Hey- 
wood assured me that if one pod 
popped Amal would be granted 
amnesty. If the earthquake is not 
severe, could Amal bring counter- 
conspiracy charges against the 
government or claim that he was 
a tool of government policy?” 

“Kley and Hey wood were quot- 
ing the official line from Wash- 
ington,” Red said, shaking his 
head. “If a killer quake strikes, 
the city will have unofficially as- 
sisted in evacuating the towers and 
the government will get the credit. 
If there’s only a mild temblor the 
government has Amal to blame 
for disrupting the city’s activities. 
He’ll never be let off the hook.” 

“But Heywood sounded so hu- 
manitarian. Surely the govern- 
ment would not carry out a vin- 
dictive policy?” 

Red looked at her as if con- 
founded by her naivete. “You’ve 
become so involved with govern- 
ment you forget its history and 
traditions. Heywood was giving 
you a cover story designed to 
bridge a credibility gap. In a way, 
you’ve been honored because on 
your own, you uncovered a gov- 
ernmental conspiracy. Our string- 
ent anti-conspiracy laws arose 
from the need of governments to 
monopolize the practice of con- 
spiracy. Anything marked top 



secret is ipso facto evidence of 
governmental conspiracy. Hey- 
wood was no doubt authorized by 
the state department to extend to 
you the full benefits of an official 
brainwashing.” 

Nils spoke up suddenly. “Hey- 
wood’s avocational job is cos- 
metician at Forest Lawn. They 
tell me he has a genius for making 
a corpse look as if it were alive.” 

“That follows,” Red Benton 
commented. 

Lyn was not interested in their 
personal comments about Hey- 
wood — and in Red Benton she 
sensed more than a conspirator or 
a behind-the-scenes manipulator. 
He had spoken with the cynicism 
of a revolutionary and she sus- 
pected he held a secret contempt 
for democratic processes. As he 
turned to Nils to outline a plan 
for tomorrow she studied his face. 

She could not share his belief 
that the government would deliber- 
ately practice malfeasance — but as 
a malfeaspr himself. Red was 
qualified to know. Even though 
she saw only his profile, his 
thoughts were clear and strong 
enough for her to read. While 
remaining strictly in the back- 
ground, he intended to get the 
black files and make a name for 
himself as a lawyer, even if it 
meant talking Nils into burglariz- 
ing the genetics department pod 
if it failed to fall. 

It was a two-unit pod, she re- 
called, on the twentieth floor. Sus*- 
pended on the Y of a double 
frame, it would probably hold. 

Still, Red had a keen legal mind 
and a thought prompted her to 
ask, “Red, what if I should find 



38 



GALAXY 




Amal and marry him? He would 
no longer be stateless.” 

“The marriage would have no 
retroactive bearing on his prior 
offenses — but if he should die 
accidentally tomorrow you could 
collect benefits as his widow.” 

“Forget it,” Lyn snapped. “I’m 
no harpy.” 

Red glanced at her, confused 
by her refusal of the opportunity. 
Nils Larsen was equally confused 
on different grounds. 

“What’s a harpy?” Nils asked. 

“An ill-strung musical instru- 
ment,” she answered, reading in 
the flippancy of her remark the 
symptoms of cultural disloca- 
tion. The rapid pace changes were 
beginning to affect her. 

“Here it is, Lyn,” Red said as 
the television stage darkened and 
the three-dimensional form of 
Amal Severn appeared. The image 
cast from lensless photographs, 
was so real Lyn felt a pang of 
recognition. The pang dissolved 
into rising anger. The questions 
asked by the voice of an offstage 
genetic detective were obviously 
slanted. 

“Leading questions,” Red called 
them, designed to point up Amal’s 
appeal to hunters. 

Amal’s answers suggested that 
he was extremely quick, bold and 
skilled in the use of camouflage. 
He could go days without water 
and could run one hundred meters 
in ten seconds. He feared nothing 
but earthquakes — and his patho- 
logical fear of quakes had led him 
to predict a disaster. 

“You get their drift?” Red said 
to her. “Nothing less than a kill- 
er quake will set Amal free. On 



the hoof, he’s worth over half a 
million dollars to the taxpayers 
of Los Angeles County in hunt- 
ing licenses.” 

Red spoke the truth. Kley and 
Heywood had lied. She sat dazed, 
the iconography of her life shat- 
tered and the dust from her plas- 
ter saints choking her. She could 
only nibble at the food the waiter 
brought. Her mouth was too dry. 
The government she had trusted 
was a fraud. 



O N Red’s advice she left the res- 
taurant after dessert. He did 
not want her involved in any possi- 
ble conspiracy he and Nils might 
discuss. But she also knew that he 
feared she was still loyal to the 
board of supervisors. He was 
wrong, but she wished to be alone. 

She left, feeling even more up- 
set by Red’s motives. He was less 
concerned with Amal or with 
righting a social wrong than with 
the opportunity to bring a class 
action against the government 
and win it. His indignation, though 
genuine, was a cover story to con- 
ceal his own ambition. No won- 
der he planned to enter politics, 
she thought — he had the talents 
of a politician. 

Whatever his failings. Red Ben- 
ton held to the integrity of his 
own thoughts, Lyn admitted, as 
she drove the Dunemaster onto 
the Harbor Freeway. In contrast, 
her mind was like a banjo on which 
anyone could pluck his tune. She 
who had been swayed so easily 
by Heywood’s charisma was now 
equally in vassalage to Red’s cyni- 
cism. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Attempting to weigh the argu- 
ments of both men, she felt the 
weight of logic was in Red’s favor. 
Contrary to Heywood’s implied 
assertion, Amal was no puppet 
on strings. For her authority she 
had Amal himself who — centur- 
ies ago, it seemed — had declaimed 
with such fervor in the Emerson’s 
parlor that he was the captain of 
his fate. 

Heywood had been completely 
wrong in assuming that for love 
of Amal she would conceal from 
him her knowledge of his origins. 
Heywood erred because he did not 
know that she was aware that she, 
too, was a product of human en- 
gineering with her dubious gifts 
of telepathy and precognition. 
What tie could bind more strong- 
ly lover and beloved than a mu- 
tual awareness that both were 
genetic freaks? 

After she had parked the Dune- 
master and brought down her 
supplies and pemmican to store 
in the auto it was her precogni- 
tion that allowed her at bedtime 
to drift almost immediately into 
an untroubled sleep. She knew 
there would be a major earth- 
quake, that far out in space the 
circling moon — which would shad- 
ow the sun tomorrow — was bring- 
ing Amal amnesty. 

For in her trance she saw the 
stanchion fall. 

Only one snag roiled the cur- 
rents of her oncoming sleep. On 
the edge of somnolence her mind 
stirred to the memory of the pop- 
ping sounds so clairaudible in her 
vision. What were they? She still 
wondered as she fell into deep slum- 
ber. 



W EDNESDAY dawned bright 
and clear, an ill portent for Los 
Angeles. Lyn rose early to catch 
the morning news. From her bed- 
room window she could see the far 
snow crest of Mount San Jacinto. 
She could feel the positive ions in 
the crystalline air drawing taut 
her skin. The wind was off the high 
desert. There would be spontane- 
ous fist fights in the parks today, 
for when the Santa Ana condi- 
tions prevailed tempers in Los 
Angeles grew frayed. Foehns had 
been used to exonerate murder- 
ers in California, and a Santa Ana 
had been blowing when Los 
Angeles was burned — both times. 

Listening to the news she felt 
rubber-brained from a mild at- 
tack of cultural shock, caused, 
she assumed, by a delayed reac- 
tion to her shift from the quiet of 
Dotham to the pace of Los 
Angeles. Amal had not been ap- 
prehended during the night, so 
she decided to put in a full three- 
hour day before joining him on 
the Skinhead Reservation after 
lunch. As she slid into her fabri- 
cated buckskin jeans, ankle boots 
and denim shirt she consid- 
ered — and decided against, be- 
cause of the weight — putting 
something by Rousseau into her 
backpack to help her understand 
the noble savages she would be 
among. By then, the office rou- 
tine should have stabilized her 
sense of reality. 

All seemed normal at the office 
when Lyn floated in. Clerks and 
typists were going about their usu- 
al minimal tasks with a maxi- 



40

mum of gossip. As usual, Kley ar- 
rived twenty minutes late. For the 
first hour and a half- her therapy 
seemed to be working. By 10:30 
she had received seven calls, only 
two of which she transferred to 
Kley. The eighth call tossed her 
senses back into the centrifuge. 

Dr. Kiefer, former professor of 
economics at U.S.C. and pres- 
ently pastor of the Skinhead 
Reservation, had urgent and pri- 
vate business with Dr. Kley. Lyn 
took the call, realizing immedi- 
ately what the urgent and private 
business concerned and know- 
ing, too, that Kiefer had called the 
wrong bureau. 

Her mental malaise left her at 
the sight of his face. When she had 
been an undergraduate, before 
the revocation of Kiefer’s tenure 
because of his anti-technology 
bias, he had been pointed out to her 
as the last Malthusian econo- 
mist. He had been young then and 
his hair had been long and flow- 
ing. Now, shorn even of eyebrows, 
his head resembled a billiard 
ball. He looked even younger than 
she remembered him, despite his 
horn-rimmed glasses whose pow- 
er of magnification seemed to 
cantilever his hrown eyes. 

All this she caught at a glance 
and focused on his background. 
He was calling from a booth in 
what must have been a country 
store, judging from the jumbled 
merchandise on the display 
counters. But the few shoppers 
she could see were browsing too 
leisurely to be agricultural 
workers. Through a window she 
saw a single auto pass, going too 
slowly to be on a freeway, so the 



store was on a rural road. The 
headdress of an Indian hanging 
on a distant wall suddenly 
clinched the location. Kiefer was 
calling from the souvenir shop at 
Old Fort Tejon, just outside the 
Skinhead Reservation. 

Unrestrained by any loyalty to 
Kley or the government, Lyn lied 
swiftly from behind her official 
smile. “If your call concerns the 
reward for Amal Severn, I’m in 
charge of temporary disburse- 
ments.’’ 

Kiefer cast a worried glance be- 
hind him. Only his head and shoul- 
ders were visible in the view frame, 
but she could see he wore a sleazy 
garment and in the V below his 
neck his chest was bare. No doubt, 
dressed in a sack cloth robe, bare- 
footed and baldheaded, Kiefer 
was concerned about his appear- 
ance in a public place. 

“That’s it. I’ve got your man. 
Here, on the reservation.” 

Slowly, officiously, she reached 
for a note pad and pen, asking, 
“Does the description fit that of 
the suspect broadcast from his of- 
ficial hologram?” 

“We don’t permit television 
on our reserve. But the one you 
want, the earthquake nut, is here. 
He’s telling my people where to 
go, how to stand . He’s scared 
stiff.” 

Lyn tapped her cheek with her 
pen. No television was permitted 
on the reserve, likewise no ra- 
dios. This paragon of Christian 
anti-technology was a hypocriti- 
cal Judas with a radio hidden on 
the reservation. 

“You realize. Doctor Kiefer — ” 
“Brother Kiefer, please.” 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

“We have received hundreds of 
calls. Brother Kiefer, which must 
be checked carefully to avoid 
false arrest suits against the city. 
Really, your description is rath- 
er vague. Literally millions of 
persons in Los Angeles are at this 
moment frightened by earth- 
quakes and — ” 

“But this one calls himself 
Amal Severn and there’s anoth- 
er, a Hal Carpenter — ” 

“You don’t quite seem to un- 
derstand the problem. For 
twenty-five thousand dollars — ’’ 

“I don’t want the money,’’ Kief- 
er interrupted, obviously anx- 
ious to get out of the store and 
back onto the reservation. 
“What I want is the equivalent in 
powdered milk, powdered eggs, 
medical supplies — ’’ 

“Please, Brother Kiefer. Those 
details will have to be settled af- 
ter the identification of the sus- 
pect is established. Now, I can 
have someone out there within 
the hour — ’’ 

“Listen, lady. I don’t want to get 
involved. 1 don’t want personal- 
ly to identify — ’’ 

“For heaven’s sake. Brother 
Kiefer, how do you propose to 
identify the suspect while incog- 
nito?’’ 

“You can send someone out to 
identify him. 1 want the sup- 
plies — that’s all.’’ 

“Very well. Brother Kiefer, I’ll 
send someone out, but how will we 
know where to find you?’’ 

Kiefer licked his lips. 

“I’ll be in my tent, meditating.’’ 
“Where is your tent?’’ 

“Come through the Fort Tejon 
Gate. Go to the pile of boulders on 



top of the hill. Cathedral rocks. 
You can’t miss them. Ask Moon 
Boy, the hermit. He lives there. 
But I want your word that the sup- 
plies will be forthcoming.’’ 

“Brother Kiefer, I can promise 
nothing until identification is 
proved. Then there will be forms to 
fill out, affidavits to attest to. 
There’ll be a broker’s commis- 
sion, usually ten per cent, for the 
purchase of your supplies. You’ll 
have to sign the broker’s release. 
A release will have to be signed 
absolving the city of responsi- 
bility in the event of defective 
merchandise. Next, of course, 
there will be requisitions to be 
signed for the city’s trucks since 
I’m sure you’ll not be transport- 
ing the merchandise — ’’ 

“Madam,’’ he broke in. “I’ll put 
my faith in the Queen of Angels. 
With her help, get someone out 
here quickly. Go with God.’’ 

He hung up. 

F rom his haste, his apprehen- 
sion, his nervousness, it would 
have been easy for the most inept 
social psychologist to recognize 
in Brother Kiefer advanced 
symptoms of maladjustment 
and his manner had struck reson- 
ances in her own mind. Suddenly 
she wondered what was wrong 
with her — Amal was in peril and 
she was analyzing Kiefer. A part 
of her psyche seemed afloat. 

Yet her detachment floated 
above a hard and solid base. She 
had shielded Amal from his fate 
for at least another hour and 
there was more she could do, much 
more. 

Switching on Kley’s intercom.

she put a smile in her voice. 

“Doctor Kley, my stomach’s a 
little upset. May 1 be excused for 
the rest of the day?” 

“Certainly, Lyn. In about half 
an hour I’m going to develop a 
splitting headache myself.” 

Leaving the office for the ele- 
vator to the garage basement, she 
recalled that Amal had laughed at 
her paper on the Skinheads. 
What she was doing naw should 
demonstrate to him that abstract 
knowledge had practical value. 
She knew exactly which roads to 
take. Oh, yes, she reminded her- 
self, a telegraphic warrant would 
permit the authorities to follow 
her onto the reservation. She 
would have to assume she was be- 
ing followed and lose her tail. 

Dropping in the elevator widen- 
ed the breach between her 
thoughts and reality. Vaguely she 
wondered when this flippancy, 
this sense of remoteness so char- 
acteristic of cultural displace- 
ment had begun. Probably when 
she found her gynodrone in Nils’ 
shower. The sight had split her be- 
tween laughter and indignation 
and the rift had not healed. 

There were earthquakes in -the 
human mind, she thought. When 
the stresses grew too great a fault 
slipped, the personality was 
shaken and slowly subsided into 
a new balance of forces. Wheeling 
the Dunemaster up the ramp, she 
decided she had been hit by a 4.8 
temblor. 

She turned on the car radio and 
focused her attention on the an- 
nouncer’s voice. His thoughts, 
more coherent than her own, 
might help to readjust her 



thought patterns, or so she hoped. 

Earthquake panic had stricken 
Los Angeles, the announcer said. 
Orderlies were moving non- 
ambulatory patients from the 
hospitals. Thank heaven, Amal 
was ambulatory. Ambulatory 
Eugenic Seven, a pretty name. 
As a result of the panic, the an- 
nouncer said, supply depots were 
being set up in the city’s parks. 

“Some panic,” she said aloud, 
thinking of Red Benton’s dis- 
taste for editorializing report- 
ers. This particular announcer 
was not much help in arranging 
her thoughts into logical pat- 
terns. Perhaps all of Los Angeles 
was in a permanent state of cul- 
tural shock. 

Thirty new warrants had been 
issued for the arrest of students 
charged with varying degrees of 
conspiracy. Among those named 
were Wallace Bergner, her floor 
warden, and Hal Carpenter. 
Gloria Jaffee, producer of the 
spectacular Los Angeles — the 
Last Day, had been arrested in 
New Jersey and was being held. 
Red Benton had been right in 
keeping Lyn’s name off the list of 
credits — but Red was always 
right. 

At San Fernando she switched 
to an inside fast lane and turned 
from the news to a classical music 
station. Still pursuing her 
dreamy self-analysis, she won- 
dered why she had changed sta- 
tions. Did she fear news from 
Hamburg, or did she wish to die to 
appropriate background music 
when she took the U-turn at Le- 
bec? 

In a fit of peevish defiance she 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



43 




turned to a hop music station and 
upped the volume on the radio. 
She would go to her Gotterddm- 
merung to the soaring strains of 
the Berkeley Bounce. Yet at the 
moment she half-wished she had 
been cloned with the forebrain of 
Leroy Thatcher. She prided her- 
self on her driving skills but she 
had never before cut from a guid- 
ance band at 300 kilometers per 
hour to make a U-turn on a busy 
freeway. 

“Well, there’s a first time for ev- 
erything,” she said aloud, testing 
her grip on the steering wheel. 

Though her words were self-ban- 
tering, her mood whimsical, a 
serious substratum of her mind 
was grateful she had planned the 
U-turn in advance and had chosen 
her spot with care. 

Past Gorman she was climbing 
toward the Grapevine, and the 
north-south lanes of the freeway 
were separating farther for the 
Lebec turn. At the curve, behind 
a huge boulder, the median strip 
was as wide as a football field, 
though far from as smooth. She 
would need every millimeter of 
the width for her turning space. 

Five hundred meters ahead, only 
a few meters north of the San An- 
dreas Fault line, the boulder swung 
into view. Her euphoria left her. 
She was alert, concentrating. 
The closest vehicle trailing her in 
the inside lane was fifty meters 
behind. If policemen were in the 
car they would have no time to re- 
act and the next turn-around was 
Wheeler Ridge, forty kilometers 
north. No helicopters were over- 
head. The green upthrusts of the 
Tehachapis were sweeping down 



and past her like waves in a fren- 
zied surf. 

G ripping the wheel with her 
left hand, she leaned forward 
and grasped the demagnetizer 
switch. She fixed her eyes on the 
marker. She no longer heard the 
blast from the radio. The boulder 
was hurtling toward her. It 
swooshed abreast of the car. 

She cut the switch, gripped the 
wheel and twisted it to the left. The 
car, freed from the guidance band, 
swerved onto the median strip. 

The strip was not empty. 
Obscured from her view by the 
boulder, a camera van was 
parked in the bight of her pro- 
posed U. One of Howebrand’s 
camera crews — she had read its 
planned location in his mind — 
was setting up to photograph the 
crashes if a fault slip snapped the 
guide bands. Her vision, blurred 
by the speed, jounce and sway of 
the Dunemaster as it careened 
over gullies, small boulders and 
hummocks aided her little in the 
instant revision of her turning 
plan as she hurtled toward the 
van and its clustered crew. 

She had gifted the cameramen 
with an unscheduled rehearsal of 
the main event, but they were not 
prepared to accept her once-in-a- 
lifetime offer. One photogra- 
pher dove from the trajectory of 
her car, but the camera he was at- 
tending had taken its last picture. 

Braking by slewing — Dotham 
boys called it “revenuer’s re- 
verse” — she twisted the wheel and 
spun the car. The Dunemaster 
missed the- van, but its giant 
wheels graded a tennis court and

GALAXY 




mowed a bale of hay before they 
gripped and shot her forward. She 
gunned the motor, heading south. 
On her left she saw the television 
camera slowly cartwheeling 
back to Earth. 

She was exhilarated. She had 
knocked the camera forty meters 
into the air if she had knocked it a 
meter and she couldn’t have cho- 
sen a more appropriate first cas- 
ualty for Amal’s earthquake. But 
her exultation was brief. Before 
her lay the southbound lanes of 
the freeway. A two-unit Diesel 
between her and Lebec was roar- 
ing downgrade. 

“Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!’’ 

She wasted no time calculat- 
ing the truck’s approach angle — 
she had solved enough geometry 
problems for the day. The short- 
est path across a freeway was at 
right angles to the traffic. She cut 
in front of the truck and found a 
full meter’s grace between the 
Dunemaster’s rear and the 
truck’s front. In anger, admira- 
tion or awe the truck driver sa- 
luted her with a blast from his klax- 
on. 

In thirty seconds her U-turn — 
modified to a Square Root Sym- 
bol turn — was completed and the 
sibilance of the freeway was fad- 
ing behind her as the Dune- 
master, straddling the San An- 
dreas Fault cleft, waddled in the 
general direction of Frazier 
Park. The only casualty was the 
radio, gone deader than Leroy 
Thatcher. 

My heavens! Is losing one’s tail 
always so delightful? 

A half-mile along she wrestled 
the Dunemaster up a scarp and 



trundled onto the rural road to 
Old Fort Tejon. On the summit 
to her right towered a pile of boul- 
ders — the uppermost boulder, 
eroded to resemble a Gothic 
arch, was Cathedral Rock. She 
swung off the road and up a ravine 
toward a clump of oaks dense 
enough to conceal the car from 
aerial observation. After she 
parked and got out she looked at 
her pendant watch. The hour was 
eleven-thirty — by now Kiefer 
was back from Old Fort Tejon and 
had begun his meditation. 

Through the boles of the trees 
she saw the cyclone fence that 
marked the Skinhead Reserva- 
tion. Following it, she stayed un- 
der the cover of the trees as far as 
the cover lasted, then ran the re- 
maining hundred meters upslope 
to the gate and entered. 

Through the gate to her left she 
could see the fresh green of a 
winter wheat field sloping away to 
the west. Ahead of her, fifty me- 
ters in a straight line, rose Ca- 
thedral Rocks. She hurried the re- 
maining distance to the abode of 
the hermit. Moon Boy. 

She heard Moon Boy before she 
saw him. 

A VOICE was issuing from the 
pile of rocks, chanting a man- 
tra in high, reedy tones. From what 
she could understand of the words 
the mantra seemed multilingual 
for, following the sound, she 
heard distinctly: “Nuestra 

sehora, Deus vous benisse, im 
heilige nomen des Jesu Cristo, 
Amen.” 

Led by the singsong chant, she 
rounded the boulders and found 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

the hermit seated cross-legged in 
the lotus position of Yogi medi- 
tation before a narrow aperture 
in the rocks. He was swaying gent- 
ly from the hips in a self-induced 
trance. His eyes did not change fo- 
cus as she moved in front of him, 
shadowing him from the sunlight. 

She looked down at him unob- 
served. His hair was long, glossy 
and dark. His beard was a neatly 
trimmed Van Dyke. The beard and 
flowing hair suggested a Jesus 
freak, but the spotless white sari 
wrapped around him reflected an 
Oriental influence. His religion, 
she decided, still trying to inter- 
pret his mantra, must be Los 
Angeles eclecticism. 

Unseres Voter Der in Him- 
mel Sein, Deliver us from 
schrecklichheit und Los 
Angeles . 

Maybe not Los Angeles eclecti- 
cism. Merely eclectic. It was dif- 
ficult for her to determine from 
his chant whether Moon Boy was 
praising God or damning Los 
Angeles, but she was not here to 
write a paper on comparative re- 
ligon. She snapped her fingers un- 
der his nose and his eyes focused. 

“Shalom, shanti and peace, 
brother,” she said. “Where may I 
find the Skinheads?” 

Moon Boy lifted a long skinny 
arm and pointed. “Follow yonder 
path to the eucalyptus grove on 
the northwest slope of the moun- 
tain. Keep to the ravine when the 
path splits.” He looked up at her in 
mild rebuke and added: “Sister, 
you have destroyed my satori.” 

Lyn lifted her watch from 



around her neck and stepped aside 
so the sun’s rays would glitter 
against it. Holding it slightly 
above the level of his eyes, she 
swung it slowly from side to side. 
“Keep your head straight, broth- 
er, and follow the movement of 
the watch with your eyes.” 

“I can’t. Your diamond is 
blinding me.” 

She shifted hands, putting her 
left hand behind her, and contin- 
ued to swing the watch, coaxing 
him back into his trance with a 
soothing, somnolent chant: 

Bins, zwei, four and three, 
Back you go to satori 
Vishnu, Isis and Vedanta 
Lo. you've learned another 
mantra. 

She doubted he even heard all of 
it. His eyes drifted out of focus 
and his torso was swinging like a 
metronome. He was no longer 
chanting. 

As she replaced her watch she 
noticed him sway and wondered if 
he had reaehieved satori. She was 
not hip enough in Zen to recognize 
the symptoms of satori but she 
hoped he at least might be zazzing 
a koan. 

She turned from him, feeling 
compassion for all seekers of 
certainties in Greater Los 
Angeles and her sadness lingered 
as she strode down the path. She 
was not given to snap diagnoses 
of complicated mental aberra- 
tions, but there was little doubt in 
her mind that Moon Boy was suf- 
fering from a cultural displace- 
ment worse than a kangaroo’s in 
a tar pit.

Really she had no right to judge 
the anomalies of others, she 
chided herself. Here she was, head 
filled with helium, floating down 
a path on a life or death mission 
after a ballbearing-busting turn 
off a freeway — and she was re- 
straining an impulse to skip along 
like a school child. Of course, her 
giddiness could be caused by the 
elevation — more than 1500 
meters — and the bouyancy of the 
air which, in the eucalyptus 
grove, was filled with the pungen- 
cy of lerp. The lerp was doing it, 
she decided. 

The path dropped into a ravine, 
where she came upon a spring 
feeding a sizable brook. After 
stopping for a drink she walked 
over and embraced the scaly bole 
of a eucalyptus, trying to an- 
chor her sense of reality on the 
solidity of the tree, to absorb its 
“treeness" with her fingertips. 
Clinging there, it occurred to her 
that this inner split might have 
started last evening wh«n Red 
Benton undermined her faith in 
the government — the moment 
of truth had revealed her alleged 
love for the democratic process as 
nothing more than the self-justi- 
fication of a common political 
group. 

For a long moment she stood 
with her arms around the tree, 
recognizing in her gesture the 
physical correlative of Moon 
Boy’s mantra. She snuggled 
closer, spreading her breasts on 
the bole. In the secret places of her 
heart she wondered — was she a 
nature worshiper? A Shintoist? 
A Druid? 

“Hell, no,’’ she answered her 



thoughts. “I’m becoming queer 
for trees.’’ 

She fled from the bole and raced 
down the path, running due west 
now — and broke from the grove, 
stopping at the sight of a young 
man on the opposite side of a 
small pool who was flailing a 
croker-sack on a rock. He was 
completely naked and hairless 
even to his pubic area. 

“Hi,” she greeted the boy. 
“Where’s Brother Kiefer and the 
rest of his shorn lambs?’’ 

“Around the shoulder of the 
hill. Brother Kiefer’s in his tent, 
meditating. Some other kook 
from the Queen of Angels is down 
there showing them what to do 
when the earthquake comes . 
Hey, are you on pot?’’ 

“No. Why do you ask?’’ 

“You look like you’re floating.’’ 
She sprinted down the path 
around the western slope of the 
mountain onto a broad meadow 
spotted with cook fires attended 
by baldheaded men in loincloths. 
Upslope to her left stood a pyra- 
midal tent that had to be Brother 
Kiefer’s, its flaps down, its cen- 
terpole topped by a Christian 
Cross. Twenty meters in front of 
her was a group of women — she 
could tell by their breasts and ba- 
bies — dressed in croker-sack robes 
watching Hal Carpenter hold a 
stake as Amal drove it with the 
blunt end of an ax. 

B ehind the group she saw a 
line of blanket hammocks sup- 
ported at each corner by stakes. In 
the thin air she could hear Amal 
explaining, “Remember, cen- 
ter the baby in the blanket. It

won’t be frightened. Babies like 
to be bounced.” 

Hal Carpenter saw her first. 
“Look, Amal! Hairy Lyn.” 

She ran forward. Dropping the 
ax, Amal strode to meet her. He 
wore mottled jeans and a mottled 
shirt. On his feet were the winter 
moccasins of the Iroquois. 

In his embrace she wept — and 
it occurred to her that her cultur- 
al shock was nothing more than 
old-fashioned anxiety for a loved 
one. It was fully a minute before 
she recovered enough compos- 
ure to shake hands with Hal Car- 
penter and to tell him a warrant 
had been issued for his arrest. 

Smiling, he shrugged. “There 
goes my chance at the Pulitzer 
Prize in Journalism.” 

“Wait till you hear what they’ve 
done to Amal,” she said, but she 
refrained from saying more be- 
cause the women were crowding 
around her to admire her ring, 
watch, shoes and hair. They looked 
skeletal. 

She saw a longing in their eyes 
that made her more ill at ease than 
their questions. They asked how 
much her diamond was worth and 
she told them it was priceless. 
They asked where she got the lock- 
et watch — from her grandmoth- 
er — and if the bottoms of her feet 
were ticklish. Yes. They wanted to 
know if her hair was dyed and if 
lice got in it. No. No. 

One woman was deliberately 
offensive. Tall, blue-eyed, under 
thirty, her melon-heavy breasts 
visible under her sleazy robe, she 
carried a baby, probably an ille- 
gal one, on a hip that flared from a 
wasp-waist. Insolence was in her 



British accent when she spoke to 
Lyn. 

“So, you’re the bird that’s got 
her ‘Reserved’ sign on Amal. 
What have you got that I haven’t 
got?” 

“Hair,” Lyn answered. 

The woman rubbed her head 
and said, “That’s my woman’s 
handicap. I can spot you hipless 
birds a full head of hair and still 
beat you in the sleeping bag.” 

Amal interposed politeness be- 
tween their hostility. 

“Sev Undgren, this is my fi- 
ancee, Lyn Oberlin. Sev’s from 
Sweden, Lyn, by way of London.” 

“Scandinavians should never 
shave their heads,” Lyn said icily. 

“Ethnic jokes aren’t appreci- 
ated here,” Sev Undgren said. 

“It wasn’t a joke. It was advice 
to the lovelorn. Amal, I must 
speak to you and Hal privately.” 

Once more walking hand in 
hand with her love, her life and the 
very fount of her romantic frus- 
trations, she climbed the hill to the 
shade of a scrub oak. The two men 
sat down in front of her, listening 
as she described affairs in the city 
and told them of Kiefer’s attempt 
to betray them for Amal’s re- 
ward. 

She told of Nils’ attempted be- 
trayal, of his later conversion, 
and of what she had learned about 
the ambulatory eugenic experi- 
ment. Without euphoria and the 
need for haste, she might have 
been more tactful in describing 
Amal’s genesis but this was no 
time for sunshine soldiers. Her 
only concession to his feelings 
was to edit all references to the 
catastrophes in Russia, South 



48 



GALAXY 




Africa and Spain. And she never 
used the term “Doomsday Gene.” 

Her words pouring from her 
had a therapeutic effect. She 
found her grasp of the seriousness 
of their situation returning as 
she talked. Into her summation 
she managed to inject an attempt 
to convince Amal that he was in 
control of his destiny. 

“Nothing’s final in your fate, 
Amal. Your genetic recklessness 
has been held in check by your con- 
ditioned drive to learn to predict 
earthquakes. Now that you’re free 
of the obsession, the geneticists 
predict your recklessness, your 
eagerness to take grave risks at 
impossible odds, may do you in. 
But no one thinks that’s inevita- 
ble. If we can get you past your 
mental letdown you’ll be safe. If 
you take no unnecessary risks 
right now we can still be married 
on schedule.” 

She had said all she could say. 

L eaning back on one elbow, 
chewing a stalk of grass, Amal 
said, “I wonder where 1 made my 
mistake in the Unified Field 
Theory.” 

“You made no mistake,” Lyn 
said. “I can assure you there’ll be 
a great earthquake.” 

He looked at her wonderingly 
and smiled. “We’ll get to Dotham, 
darling. I’ve won against odds all 
my life. There’s no reason to 
change my habits.” 

Hal Carpenter was more upset 
than Amal. 

“This sort of experiment is il- 
legal. The bureau of scientific 
ethics has forbidden the use of 
human beings in experiments. 



The ban grew out of the twentieth- 
century Nuremberg Trials. We’re 
human beings, not guinea pigs.” 

“Speak for yourself, Hal,’’ 
Amal said, but Lyn caught no bit- 
terness in his remark, only irony. 

“I speak for humanity,” Hal 
said. “We’re not the playthings of 
the tin gods of biological science. 
With or without a police rec- 
ord — if we can get those black 
files I’ll win a Pulitzer for writing 
the expose.” 

Suddenly eagerness crept into 
his indignation. 

“Amal, I’m sitting on the news 
story of the decade. You’re the 
central figure in the most hein- 
ous crime against humanity since 
the bloody twentieth century. 
Give me exclusive rights and we’ll 
split a pot of money. You’ll need 
every dime you can get now 
they’ve canceled your green card.” 

Hal was following Red Ben- 
ton’s pattern, Lyn thought, using 
Amal for his own ends. 

“As a public figure 1 can’t 
grant exclusive rights,” Amal 
said. 

“But you can authorize my 
story.” 

“Very well. Consider your 
expose authorized,” Amal said. 
“Now, let’s visit the loving 
pastor.” 

“The hypocritical liar,” Lynn 
exploded. 

“Which doesn’t reflect on his 
professional ability,” Amal re- 
marked with a tolerance Lyn 
found hard to understand. 

Strangely reluctant, Hal said, 
“But Brother Kiefer’s meditat- 
ing.” 

“Rather, he’s in his tent listen- 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



49 




ing to his radio,” Lyn said cyni- 
cally. 

“An electronic instrument 
would violate his creed,” Hal said, 
rising and suddenly eager to go. 
“If we find it we can threaten him 
with an expose to keep him quiet.” 
“Who would we expose him to?” 
“He has an ad hoc creed com- 
mittee of four deacons.” 

“Get him into the sunlight so I 
can see his face,” Lyn promised, 
“and I’ll find his radio. Ask him 
outright where it’s hidden. He’ll 
be surprised to see me. He doesn’t 
know he called the wrong depart- 
ment for the reward. From this 
area he should have dialed the 
Northridge sheriffs office.” 

“Pity, the poor preacher in a 
bureaucratic maze,” Amal said. 

Amal was taking his situation 
too casually, Lyn thought as they 
walked toward the tent, moving 
silently to catch the sound of a ra- 
dio. His self-confidence could be 
dangerous. She wondered if she 
should tell him of the Doomsday 
Gene and its catastrophic side ef- 
fects. For the sake of others, she 
knew, he would be more cautious. 
They heard no radio. 

A short distance from the tent 
Amal whispered to Hal, still in a 
jocular vein, “I’ll talk. You listen. 
You might get a footnote for my 
biography.” 

Striding to the tent, he pulled 
aside the flap and called in, “Come 
out, Keifer.” 

His three words carried a 
weight of command that brought 
Kiefer blinking into the sun- 
light. 

“My son, I was meditating.” 
“No matter. I’ve brought a 



cheek for Judas to kiss in the pres- 
ence of a witness from Los 
Angeles. Unfortunately the wit- 
ness is a lady.” 

Kiefer was a small man, barely 
topping a meter and a half. He 
grew suddenly smaller as he 
recognized Lyn. His eyes had a 
tortured look and his voice held a 
quaver. 

“My son, I’ve been asking 
God’s grace on your soul and for 
me — forgiveness.” 

He was telling the truth, Lyn 
saw. 

“I suppose you can mouth a lot 
of prayers during the commer- 
cial breaks,” Amal said. “Where’s 
your radio hidden?” 

“1 have no concealed radio, my 
son,” he said, thinking: God for- 
give me. but technically I'm tell- 
ing the truth. The radio’s in plain 
sight. 

Lyn reached over and plucked 
his eyeglasses from his head. She 
twisted an inset knob on the left 
temple of the glasses. Faintly but 
clearly they could hear: 
“ . Angeles asking, is this the 
way the world ends? A few die- 
hards are staying in the towers. 
Will they, if this all proves a fizzle, 
have the last laugh?” 

S HE turned off the radio and 
handed the glasses back to 
Kiefer, saying, “Another sin. 
Brother. Hypocrisy. What will 
your lambs think of their Judas 
now?” 

“This will ruin my mystique,” 
he muttered, fumbling his glass- 
es back on. “Amal, 1 wasn’t doing 
this for money, but for medicine 
for the children, food for my peo- 



50 



GALAXY 




pie. You have eaten with us. You 
have seen our problems. I was not 
asking for the fifty thousand in 
money — only in supplies for my 
people.” 

“Is that true, Lyn?” Amal 
asked, his voice suddenly gentle. 

“True about the supplies, but 
the sum agreed on was twenty-five 
thousand dollars.” 

“No,” Brother Kiefer said. 
“The sum has been doubled by the 
American Hunters’ Associa- 
tion.” 

“Why didn’t you wait until af- 
ter the earthquake?” Amal asked. 
His voice held only curiosity now. 

“Because I had faith in you, my 
son. You have prophesied an 
earthquake and one will come. My 
people, untutored in the ways of 
science, would then have believed 
you chosen of God and would not 
have permitted the authorities to 
take you. There would have been 
bloodshed.” 

He turned to Lyn. 

“That was why I wished to keep 
to my tent until you came. My 
flock would reject me if they knew 
I had betrayed a friend. It has 
been a dry spring. Summer will be 
harsh. They need a leader. And 
food.” 

Amal said gently, “It’s true 
about the camp, Lyn. The people 
are close to starvation. The chil- 
dren have whooping cough, 
measles, hepatitis.” 

She listened, sensing the flow of 
his thoughts and thinking of blood 
being shed and of Heywood’s pre- 
diction. She felt awed by the im- 
minence of fate. 

Amal turned back to Brother 
Kiefer, speaking now with the au- 

THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



thority of a general outlining 
a plan of battle. 

“We’ll do it this way. Brother 
Kiefer. Lyn’s car has a telephone. 
Hal can bring it through the gates 
as far as Cathedral Rock — ” 

“My son, no automobiles are 
allowed on — ” 

“I’m sure you can persuade 
your committee to permit an- 
other slight violation of the camp 
rules. If not, there’s the radio to 
prove to them no precedent is be- 
ing broken.” 

“Very well, my son.” 

“At one-twenty you can call the 
sheriff’s office at Northridge to 
report me. I can come on the 
screen and say that you’ve per- 
suaded me. A few more lies are 
permissible, aren’t they. Rev- 
erend? Then, come what may, 
you’ll be on record for the re- 
ward. If it’s a minor earthquake 
you can start collecting the sup- 
plies immediately.” 

“But the hunters^ — ” Lyn inter- 
jected. 

“They’re part of my plan. I can 
evade the hunters.” 

“If so, you’ll be welcomed back 
here, my son.” 

“No,” Amal shook his head. 
“We’ll go for broke. I’ll explain 
my plan to your people at lunch 
and you can claim the bounty on 
me twice. The law against double 
triple jeopardy applies to state- 
less persons and after my second 
escape I’ll be a free man.” 

I N THE entire history of the hunt- 
ing preserve, only one man had 
managed to escape three times, 
Lyn remembered. Yet Amal was 
almost blithely offering to per- 

51 




form the impossible on behalf of 
this wretched collection of social 
rejects. He was taking unselfish- 
ness too far. 

In fear, anger and admiration 
she blurted out, “Amal, I must talk 
to you alone.” 

Drawn by the urgency in her 
voice, he walked aside with her and 
in their short walk she regained 
enough composure to make her 
reluctant to tell him immediate- 
ly of the Doomsday Gene he car- 
ried. She floundered through an 
introduction which, she hoped, 
might soften the implications of 
her explanation. 

“Amal, I saw you in a vision, 
dressed as you are, concealing a 
longbow and seven arrows on the 
Angeles Crest Preserve.” 

“Then you really are psychic,” 
he said, more bemused than 
amazed. 

“You may call it that. Actually 
I think we’re both in the black 
files — that I, too, am a product of 
their ‘human engineering.’ ” 

“Then, we have even more in 
common than we thought.” 

“I cherish what we have in com- 
mon, but your recklessness fright- 
ens me. You’re doing exactly 
what Heywood said you would do, 
challenge the redhats.” 

“Does it matter? You’ve al- 
ready foreseen a major quake 
haven’t you?” 

“In my vision I saw a great 
earthquake, a cataclysm, but I 
don’t know when it will happen. 
You were near, but you weren’t 
with me and I was dreadfully con- 
cerned.” 

“That’s understandable. I’m 
chief marshal for the Cal Tech 



tower. When the quake strikes I’ll 
be very busy.” 

“But there’s nothing in those 
visions to assure me the earth- 
quake will strike at the hour you 
predicted, this month or this year. 
1 saw only a fragment of the fu- 
ture in the trance. Now I have to 
assume it will happen today and 
you won’t be with me because . 
But enough of this— I don’t want 
you thinking I’m some mystic 
seer, some freak. I have something 
more important to tell you.” 

Then she told him of the Dooms- 
day Gene and of the death and de- 
struction its three other carriers 
had caused. He heard her out with 
an intent but poised demeanor 
she could not have penetrated had 
his brain waves been normal. En- 
couraged by his acceptance and 
his strength, she spoke bluntly of 
the Mayfly factor, of his over- 
whelming death wish, of his 
genetic drive to weave from chance 
circumstances the strands of his 
own doom and that of others. The 
expression in his eyes never 
changed. 

When she finished he stood in 
thoughtful silence for a moment. 

Then: “As Kiefer pointed out, I 
could cause bloodshed by staying 
here. On Angeles Crest my bomb 
could be defused. Possibly the 
other catastrophes were merely 
coincidences, though incredible. 
Still, they’re no more incredible 
than Mrs. Murphy’s cow — it 
kicked over the lamp that burned 
Chicago. Unless Mrs. Murphy’s 
cow carried a Doomsday Gene. 
Granted this hokum has a certain 
validity, I would still be safer on 
the hunting preserve.” 



52

“Amal, I’m selfish. I don’t care 
about anyone but you. You could 
be killed on the preserve — or 
murder someone.” 

“Darling, I’ll not be killed by the 
hunters. And I won’t hurt them. 
Perhaps some will get an arrow in 
the butt if they get too close.” He 
smiled. “It would be self-defeat- 
ing to teach a hunter empathy for 
his quarry by killing him.” 

He grasped her by the shoulder 
and tilted her eyes up to meet his. 

“Don’t weep for me. I have you 
to live for. True, I hid a non-me- 
tallic weapon on the preserve, 
foreseeing this, but it was put 
there only for my self-defense in 
the moral equivalent of war. For- 
give me for throwing your words 
back at you.” 

“But Heywood predicted this.” 
“Forget Heywood.” His voice 
went suddenly harsh and he 
looked beyond her. When his eyes 
focused again on hers the gentle- 
ness returned. “His prediction 
was based on nothing but logic. 
The only way I can master my 
destiny is by responding to logi- 
cal challenges. Kiefer has unwit- 
tingly given me a chance to be of 
service to his people while I im- 
mobilize my Doomsday Gene. 
So you see, fate can work in my fa- 
vor. Put your faith in me, not in 
Heywood’s fortune telling. Un- 
less you have a better alterna- 
tive.” 

“Kiefer could marry us. We 
could live on the preserve.” 

“With dirt, hunger, and dis- 
ease? Oh, no, Lyn. You deserve 
more.” 

He was right. There would be 
dirt, hunger, disease — and Sev 



Undgren swinging those hips to- 
ward Amal every time Lyn’s back 
was turned. 

Heywood had said that if substi- 
tute psychological pressures re- 
strained Amal he might survive 
the crises. And Nils had said of 
Amal that no hunter could kill 
him. Strangely, the geneticists who 
had brought her life to this im- 
passe offered her the greatest com- 
fort as she watched the currents of 
Amal’s fate converge on their pre- 
destined end. 

“Whatever you do, Amal, you 
have my love and support.” 

He embraced and kissed her in 
full view of the others — a public 
show of devotion which, for him, 
required courage. Now she could 
think of predestination without 
fear. Her glimpse of the future had 
shown her a fragment of a warp 
and woof weaving itself into a 
pattern of deliverance for her 
and Amal. 

“We’ll be married in Dotham 
next Sunday,” he whispered and 
for the first time in weeks she felt 
secure. 

W A RELIC for your shrine,” 

** Lyn whispered to Moon Boy 
as she crowded around him to store 
Amal’s emergency kit in the rock 
crevice. A Skinhead had brought 
the hermit a bowl of thin barley 
soup — “lunch” on the reserva- 
tion — and he had sipped it all 
without spilling a drop or miss- 
ing a beat in his metronomic sway. 
She assumed the police would not 
search the hermit’s cave. Amal’s 
kit contained a pistol — for de- 
stroying fear-maddened dogs, he 
had told her. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



53 




She was grateful for the minor 
task. It gave her an excuse to stay 
away from her car while Amal, 
Kiefer and Hal put in the call to 
Northridge. After Lyn had esti- 
mated twenty minutes flying time 
for the police departments Black 
Maria they had decided to make 
the call at 1:20 to give Kiefner 
time to return to his flock before 
the quake hit. 

Emerging from the cave, she 
could see Kiefer exit from the car 
and hurry down the path, indi- 
cating that the call had been com- 
pleted. In the little more than an 
hour she had spent among the 
Skinheads she had learned to re- 
spect the preacher and to feel com- 
passion for his flock. During 
lunch she had come to understand 
Amal’s desire to help the people, 
particularly since they had 
vehemently protested his de- 
cision to give himself up. A ma- 
jority preferred to risk starva- 
tion rather than let him put his life 
on the line on the hunting pre- 
serve. He won his point by assur- 
ing them he would have to face the 
hunters regardless of whether 
people here profited or not. 

Kiefer, who truly detested elec- 
tronic equipment, had also ex- 
plained to Lyn that the minia- 
turized radio was a necessary 
evil for the survival of the sect, 
which depended largely on Los 
Angeles for its supplies. The cult’s 
dogma reflected the adaptabil- 
ity of its leader. For members too 
simple-minded to grasp the ab- 
stractions of religion, Kiefer’s 
nightly sermons were held on the 
southeast slope of the mountain 
where the glow from Civic Center 



was visible. A few cultists be- 
lieved the glow was actually the 
halo from the Queen of Angels, 
Mary, and Kiefer had not disen- 
thralled such votaries. 

All seekers could find refuge in 
the sanctuary and were free to 
share its bounty — unfortunate- 
ly little more than starvation ra- 
tions. The hairlessness of cult 
members held no religious sig- 
nificance — it was a deterent to 
the spread of lice. The sackcloth 
robes and loincloths were worn 
from economic necessity, not be- 
cause of any vow of poverty. As 
Amal remarked privately to 
Lyn, all that the cult possessed in 
abundance were love and malnu- 
trition. 

Now Amal and Hal were ap- 
proaching her and Amal called 
out, “The helicopter will land in 
the wheatfield, marking on your 
automobile. We’re going to 
move Moon Boy away from the 
rocks. They might topple when the 
quake hits.” 

“Shall I snap him out of it?” 
“No. Let him sway. Hal and I 
can carry him in scout saddle.” 
They slid their hands beneath 
him, interlocked their wrists, 
hoisted the still-swaying Moon 
Boy and carried him into the 
meadow. Lyn followed. 

“He’s an apostate,” Hal told 
her. “He rejected the Skinheads 
because Brother Kiefer preach- 
es in English. He thinks many lan- 
guages make rituals truer and 
more impressive.” 

She knew Hal’s chatter was for 
Amal’s diversion rather than her 
own. Both of them could sense 
Amal’s animal fear as he walked 



54 



GALAXY 




stiff-gaited away from the Moon 
Boy and looked back at the rocks. 
He was fighting to control panic. 

She decided on instant therapy 
when he turned to her and asked, 
“How much more time, Lyn?” 

“Four minutes. Don’t be so up- 
set, Amal. You know this is a neu- 
rotic fear, planted in your mind to 
encourage you to study seis- 
mology.’’ 

“Sure, it’s all in my mind. 
Schizophrenia’s all in the mind, 
too. But this fear’s based on knowl- 
edge. I know what forces are re- 
leased by an earthquake. One 
killed my mother.” 

She was tempted to tell him on 
the spot that his mother was alive, 
but that bit of information was 
to be her wedding gift to him. Be- 
sides, her therapy was working. 
Amal was growing calmer. 

“Lyn, this is the position I 
want you to take,” he said, squat- 
ting to lean forward on his wide- 
spread palms, balancing his hind- 
quarters on the balls of his feet. 
“A severe shock can rupture you 
or break a bone.” 

Obediently she took position, 
feeling a little foolish — like a 
grownup playing leapfrog. 

“Take your watch off your 
neck,” he said. “It could damage 
an eye.” 

She laid the watch before her on 
the grass and focused on its sweep 
second hand, saying, “Three min- 
utes.” 

“Take position, Hal,” Amal 
ordered. 

Looking at the second hand 
moving around the face of the 
watch put thoughts of the globe in 
her mind. Far off, above the At- 



lantic, the shadow of the moon 
had been racing toward the Isth- 
mus. Now it was darkening the 
jungles of Guatemala. She could 
feel in her mind the vast internal 
forces of the Earth’s shifting and 
the fluctuation of the planet’s 
magnetic field. An eerie hush lay 
over the land. Something was 
growing in the atmosphere, an 
electricity, a plasma that made her 
feel playful as a kitten before a 
storm. 

She glanced toward Amal, 
crouched a body’s length away 
from her, hoping to cheer him 
with a smile. But she did not smile. 
His face was drained of blood. His 
eyes were terror-stricken. She 
marveled at the power of his pho- 
bia. Every line of his body told her 
he was weathering tornadoes of 
fear scourging the landscapes of 
his mind. Yet this was the same 
man, who had agreed almost hap- 
pily to offer himself as prey of 
the hunters, an act she was begin- 
ning to understand. The terror 
he faced from the hunters would 
be mild compared to the horror 
he was facing now. 

Then it came, a slight shiver of 
the Earth, a mild rolling shock. A 
few birds fluttered from a nearby 
oak, twittered and settled back 
into the branches. 

Amal rose to his feet, grinning 
sheepishly, and said, “That was 
it. It’s all over.” 

“But it was an earthquake,” 
Lyn said, “precisely at one thirty- 
three. At least you’ve saved face.” 

“It’s not my face I’m worried 
about anymore. Let’s put Moon 
Boy back, Hal.” 

As the two replaced the hernfiit 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Lyn walked to the edge of the 
wheatfield, scanning the sky. Un- 
til now she had believed Amal to 
be all but superman. Vulner- 
able, error-prone, he was the most 
human of humans, a little more 
shy, more brave, more fearful, 
more compassionate. The 
geneticists could take pride in 
their AE 7 if he survived, but noth- 
ing was certain anymore. Even 
her clairvoyant’s view of a great 
earthquake had been as insub- 
stantial as any vision conjured by 
Prospero. 

Nothing was certain but the dot 
in the sky above the southern 
mountains. She watched it grow, 
become audible, then recogniza- 
ble as the huge black-and-white 
shape of a Sikorski helicopter, 
the prisoners’ van of the L.A.P.D. 

X 

A t 1:30 P.M., in Bakersfield, 
California, an employee of the 
California Edison Company had 
left a room housing the control 
panel that monitored all power sta- 
tions in San Joaquin-Tehachapi 
District. He had gone across the 
hall, ostensibly for a cup of coffee. 
Actually the technician wished to 
flirt with a new receptionist. Flora 
Whitfield, hoping to relieve the te- 
dium of his assignment. The mo- 
ment Charles Martell stepped from 
the control room marked the last 
opportunity for any human agency 
to control the destructiveness of 
the Doomsday Gene. 

Martell had poured his coffee 
and was pausing at the recep- 
tionist’s desk to drop a quarter in- 



to the office kitty when Little 
Palmdale struck. 

“Did you feel a quake. Flora?’’ 

“My rose did.’’ She pointed to a 
gently swaying bud vase holding 
a long-stemmed rose. 

“Some nut in L.A. was proph- 
esying a quake,” Martell said, 
glancing at his watch, “and he hit 
it on the button — one thirty- 
three.” 

“I saw his hologram,” Flora 
said. “He was a handsome boy, 
young and slender. I heard they is- 
sued a license on him.” 

“The young and slender ones 
make the best hunting,” the tech- 
nician said. “Did you make this 
coffee?” 

“Yes. Like it?” 

“Never tasted better — and 1 got 
one of the newest coffee makers 
at home . .” 

It was fifteen minutes before 
Martell returned to the control 
panel across the hall and saw the 
red light on the panel board. He 
walked over and jiggled the board, 
testing to see if the red light had 
been activated by a short circuit. 
It continued to glow. 

He sat at his desk and called the 
Tehachapi power distributing 
facility. 

“Bakersfield, Ed. Have you got 
the steamfitters in mohole 
three?” 

“They’re topside, sweating out 
Little Palmdale.” 

“I’m getting a critical signal 
from the pile. You’d better get 
them back — No, hold it. This 
thing could have been red for fif- 
teen minutes. Don’t risk a crew. 
Shut off the pile. I’ll check with 
L.A. and get a repair crew.” 



56 



GALAXY 




“Wilco, Bakersfield. Am clos- 
ing off mohole three." 

Martell leaned back, consider- 
ing the problem. He was con- 
fident he was getting a false read- 
ing. No pile in any atomic steam- 
generating plant had ever grown 
critical. As a sop to the public, the 
steam plants had been located in 
tunneled offshoots from the mo- 
holes dug long before by geo- 
physicists penetrating the Earth’s 
crust. Theoretically it was al- 
most an impossibility for a pile 
to grow critical. The cadmium 
dampening rods which absorbed 
the atomic radiation operated by 
gravity if the electromagnet 
holding them in position failed. If 
a signal to the magnet malfunc- 
tioned and the rods were held out 
of an overheated pile, the steam 
channels were voided by the heat 
and the voided channels them- 
selves acted as dampeners to cool 
the reactor. 

In any event, the matter was aca- 
demic. Once the blast gate into the 
feeder tunnel was closed the pile 
could blow. But the only surface 
effect from the explosion seven 
thousand meters below would be 
a slight change in the purr of an air- 
conditioner, a flicker in a light 
bulb, as other generators took 
over. The Southern California 
power grid, built before the Holo- 
caust, was designed for twice the 
population it served. 

Martell was not worried. 

W HAT the technician did not 
know was that the subter- 
ranean shock from Little Palm- 
dale had been sufficient to jar 
loose the laser terminal of the 



stress sensor Amal had placed on 
the Garlock Fault, through which 
the feeder tunnel was bored. Tilt- 
ing downw'ard, the pulse from 
Amal’s laser synchronized with 
the pulsations along the laser 
beam from the more heavily 
anchored pile-control laser. The 
"impossible" chain of events 
which had occurred in Spain, 
South Africa, and Russia was tak- 
ing place in Southern California. 
Now the laser beam was trans- 
mitting to the local control panel a 
light pulse which the control board 
was interpreting as: “Lift rods.” 

Only a week earlier the pile at 
mohole three had been enriched 
with a fresh supply of uranium. 
Moreover, the steam-vent pipes 
were being replaced in the boiler 
room. Steamfitters had jury- 
rigged a fire hose as a temporary 
vent. The hose snaked through the 
exit from the generating room in- 
to the tunnel. Though swollen 
from the overload of steam which 
the lifted rods were generating, 
the hose was venting the steam 
harmlessly into the tunnel when 
the blast gate dropped. The hose 
was pinched off. 

The dropping gate cut the con- 
trol signal, allowing the cadmium 
rods to drop back into the pile, but 
they fell onto a cushion of steam 
and did not fall far enough to 
dampen the reaction. Gradually, 
but inexorably, steam pressure 
forced the rods back toward the 
ceiling. The generating room be- 
gan to fill with live steam. The 
steam grew superheated and the 
emissions in the pile stepped up. 
Live, superheated steam stimu- 
lated the emission of radiation

which further heated the steam 
which stimulated more emis- 
sions . 

On the scale of forces that move 
the Earth an atomic explosion is a 
firecracker on a mountainside, 
but if conditions are right the ex- 
plosion of a firecracker on a 
mountain can release an ava- 
lanche. 

Mohole three was .6 of a kilom- 
eter from the Garlock Fault. The 
Garlock Fault intersects the San 
Andreas Fault at Frazier Park. 
Frazier Park is five kilometers 
from the point on the mountain 
where the L.A.P.D. Sikorski was 
preparing to land. 

Little Palmdale had hit and was 
over. Great Frazier was on the 
way. 

G azing up at the helicopter 
Lyn thought, How like a mon- 
strous dragonfly. and turned 
toward the rocks. Amal Jiad asked 
her to stay and prepare the supply 
list for Brother Kiefer. Now she 
was familiar enough with Amal’s 
modus operandi to realize he 
wanted her to keep busy, to keep 
her mind off what was happening 
to him. 

The faint, fluttering sound of the 
helicopter should have been audi- 
ble to Hal and Amal, but neither 
was looking skyward, she no- 
ticed. She mounted toward 
Cathedral Rocks. They had put 
Moon Boy back in front of his cave 
and were standing beside him, 
looking down the northeast slope 
of the mountain. 

As she topped the ridge line and 
looked down her heart fibrillated. 



Heywood’s prophesy would be ful- 
filled. 

Filtering out of the eucalyptus 
grove came a skirmish line of Skin- 
heads, resembling an army of 
cave dwellers in their sack robes 
and burlap loincloths. They were 
keeping to a ragged line of battle. 
In their vanguard marched the 
roly-poly Kiefer — and swinging 
beside him was a baldheaded 
Amazon with unmistakably 
wide hips bearing aloft the Cross 
of Jesus. 

This was no peaceable demon- 
straton, Lyn saw at a glance. It 
was an act of defiance so brave, 
futile and pathetic it brought a 
mist to Lyn’s eyes — the last 
knights of Christendom had come 
on a crusade, armed with sticks. 

She moved swiftly to Hal and 
Amal, hearing Hal say, “They 
look like Neanderthals hunting 
for mammoth.” 

With incredible sang froid Amal 
turned to Hal — and was actually 
chuckling as he spoke: “My lunch- 
time oratory didn’t work. They’re 
not going to let us be taken alive 
after all.” 

Here was the possibility Hey- 
wood — and now Lyn — feared. 
There would be an entire squad of 
riot troopers in the Sikorski and 
they would be armed with ma- 
chine guns. 

The Skinheads were fifty meters 
below them. Kiefer turned, march- 
ing backward, and lifted his hands 
high in some cabalistic signal. 
Then he dropped his hands. When 
his palms struck his thighs his tat- 
tered battalions, as one voice, 
broke into the rousing strains of 
Onward Christian Soldiers. 



58 



GALAXY 




Malnourished, barefooted, weak 
and diseased, the Skinheads were 
working themselves into a mar- 
tial frenzy. Their singing drowned 
the hum of the helicopter’s en- 
gines. 

Then Amal was racing downhill 
to say something to Kiefer, walk- 
ing beside the preacher, gesticulat- 
ing, bent down, shouting. Kiefer 
kept shaking his head. Once he 
shrugged as if to say. The matter 
is out of my hands. 

Abreast of the rocks now, they 
were advancing toward the 
wheatfield, men in the front ranks, 
women and children in the rear. 
Lyn had not known there were so 
many and she could understand 
their tactic now. They were deny- 
ing the landing area to the heli- 
copter, interposing their bodies 
between it and the wheatfield. 

The helicopter was hanging in 
the sky above them. It dropped and 
its roar drowned out the song as it 
circled once, lazily, as if recon- 
noitering the terrain. It rose a lit- 
tle in the air. The men aboard the 
vehicle would have seen the wea- 
pons and would have gauged the 
hostility of the crowd. 

Below the plateau on which the 
wheatfield stood, a wedge-shaped 
peninsula jutted from the edge of 
the mountain, its narrowest 
point against the mountainside. 
On each side of the outjut was a 
deep ravine — behind it the cliff 
face fell precipitously to the slope 
of the mountain. On this spot, 
cluttered with boulders inter- 
spersed with chaparral, the pilot 
decided to land. He angled slow- 
ly onto the ledge, cut his rotors 
and activated his air jets. For a 



moment the helicopter hovered 
above the area, then settled gen- 
tly. Its air blasts had cleared its 
own landing field. 

The first skirmish had ended in a 
clear victory for the tech- 
nologists, although the police now 
had over a hundred-meter climb to 
the wheatfield. They had landed 
and the helicopter was in an easily 
defended position. 

Amal began to shout to the 
Skinheads when the rotors fell 
silent. “Hal and I appreciate your 
self-sacrifice, but render unto 
Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. 
Hal and I belong to Caesar. Let us 
go in peace. There is no danger. 
Hal will be safe in jail. I will be safe 
on the hunting preserve. 

“I repeat — I will be safe on the 
hunting preserve. I’ve never lied to 
you. I said there would be an earth- 
quake at one thirty-three. It came. 
What I now tell you is also true; I 
will be safe on the hunting pre- 
serve because I can dodge rifle 
bullets. 

“So, I beg you, get back to the 
Crestline, Don’t jeopardize your 
lives and the sanctity of this 
reservation to which I shall return 
after I escape the hunters. With- 
out the sanctuary of your reserva- 
tion — 1 will have no hope.’’ 

They began moving back — ei- 
ther they believed he could dodge 
bullets or sensed his desperate 
need for a sanctuary. Lyn was cer- 
tain they were not influenced by 
his arguments in behalf of Caesar. 

Then Amal was calling to her, 
“Go back with them, Lyn, and 
stand in plain view of the police. 
They’ll not fire into the crowd if 
they see you.” 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

E ven as she glowed at his exag- 
gerated estimate of her effec- 
tiveness as a deterrent to police 
violence, she was frightened. Three 
days ago she would have thought 
anyone insane who suggested the 
police would fire into an innocent 
crowd. That they would do so now 
was her fear, particularly when she 
saw the line of blue-coated, black- 
helmeted men, visors on their hel- 
mets, filing across the neck of the 
promontory and climbing toward 
the plateau. They were young, 
hard-faced, eager-looking. Three 
carried automatic rifles and two 
were carrying long tubes resem- 
bling stovepipes. 

When it reached the plateau on 
which the wheat was planted the 
squad did not advance uphill but 
walked along the ledge, spreading 
into a skirmish line, twelve men 
plus a lieutenant. The line halted, 
faced right and stood at attention. 
Visors were lowered at a barked 
order. At two hundred meters the 
line of blukes looked formidable. 

Amal and Hal herded the Skin- 
heads up the slope. They stopped at 
the crest, looking down at the 
officers. 

Amal shouted toward the po- 
licemen, “Amal Severn and Hal 
Carpenter are coming down, un- 
armed. Doctor Kley’s secretary is 
among these people. Hold your 
fire.” 

Amal and Hal moved toward 
the skirmish line. The lieutenant 
walked alone uphill to meet them. 
In his right hand he held a pistol, in 
his left two pairs of handcuffs. At 
each end of the police line the two 
officers carrying stovepipes 
pointed them uphill. 



Hal and Amal moved cautious- 
ly into the wheatfield, walking as 
if they feared a sudden movement 
might precipitate a clash. Impas- 
sively the line of policemeTi 
waited, their backs to the begin- 
ning slope of the mountain. As 
wary as his adversaries, the lieu- 
tenant advanced uphill. They 
moved ten paces toward each 
other. 

At 1:53 the Tehachapi pile blew. 
A slight tremor shivered along the 
Garlock Fault to the San An- 
dreas Intercept. The northeast 
face of the Garlock Fault had 
quivered ever so slightly, but 
enough. Garlock snapped at the 
San Andreas Intercept. 

Great Frazier struck. 

T hat part of upper and lower 
California which for eons had 
been millimetering away from the 
mainland toward Asia took, in 
geological terms, a giant step to- 
ward Japan. The first human 
casualty of Great Frazier was a 
Los Angeles policeman with a 
bazooka on his shoulder who, 
when falling backward, was 
literally pole-vaulted down the 
mountain slope and broke his aim- 
ing shoulder against a boulder. 

For Lyn, there was no ioniza- 
tion of the atmosphere to warn her 
this one was coming. Her atten- 
tion was focused on Amal and 
Hal, looking remote and lonely 
between the two hostile lines, and 
the silence over the field was so pal- 
pable she could have reached out 
and touched it. No birds sang. 

Suddenly there was sound. To 
Lyn it seemed as if a thousand jet 
planes were taxiing across some 



60 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 




hardpan in the sky immediately 
above her, yet she could hear Amal 
shrill, “Crawl position, every- 
body. Crawl position!” 

She went to her crawl position, 
placing her watch in the grass be- 
fore her, noting the time — 1:53. 
Then the watch began to skitter 
back and forth across the grass. 
Her palms had barely touched be- 
fore the sheer waves merged with 
the long waves. The Earth heaved. 
Nearby she heard a limb break 
from an oak tree and down the line 
a man screamed, his voice hyphe- 
nated by the waves of the Earth un- 
til his keening became an ulula- 
tion, rising and falling. 

She heard a woman cry out, 
“Somebody stop it!” 

Nobody was stoppirig it. Dust 
was rising out of the grass in a 
choking pall. Downhill, the rank 
of policemen was gone, either 
fallen down the slope or lost to her 
view in the dust. 

Mount Tejon, literally, was 
dancing. Walpurgis by sunlight, 
she thought, and the mountain had 
joined the valse macabre, the dance 
of death. 

She felt no panic, no fear, no 
awe. These emotions would come 
later. At the moment she felt no 
more alarm than a kernel of pop- 
corn in a popper. She was solely 
intent on remaining balanced in 
her four-limbed stance and, after 
five minutes of bouncing without 
being toppled, she was thanking 
her ballet lessons for her sense of 
balance. It was becoming a com- 
petitive game — she would not let 
the quake topple her as it was do- 
ing to the rocks on the crest. 

She wasn’t thrown. She was 



crabbed into a southwest facing 
position where she could see the 
distant white form of Moon Boy, 
still in his lotus position, bounc- 
ing down the northeast gradient 
from the crest like some spring- 
propelled toy. On the southeast 
edge of the rock pile she saw a less- 
er boulder — hardly more than 
twice as big as a Dotham house- 
— jiggle from the mass of 
Cathedral Rocks. It shivered on 
the edge of the incline — then an 
Earth convulsion sent it rolling 
downhill. Suddenly the boulder 
was gaining speed, rolling, bounc- 
ing, hurtling downslope toward 
the police helicopter one hundred 
meters below. 

She saw the juggernaut arc from 
an overhang, its trajectory carry- 
ing it straight toward the helicop- 
ter. But the boulder did not strike 
the Sikorski. The outjut on which 
the aircraft sat vanished, taking 
the helicopter with it. All were 
gone, aircraft, promontory, 
boulder, in a three-hundred-foot 
drop into the canyon. As far as 
Lyn could detect, the landslide 
did not add a decibel to the roar 
from the Earth. 

She glanced down toward Hal 
and Amal, wondering if they had 
seen the side of the mountain peel 
away, but both were facing her, 
both rigid on all four limbs and 
bouncing downhill toward 
her — which was strange since she 
was above them. Within the next 
five minutes, simply by holding 
their posture, they were bounced 
three meters closer to her. While 
one part of the mountain sank, an- 
other part had risen. 

It struck her that Amal looked 



GALAXY 



61 




no more panic-stricken than Hal. 
In respect to terror they were run- 
ning a dead heat, when suddenly 
Hal went up and came down on his 
side. She heard herself cry, “Tilt!” 
Hal was well disciplined. Jounc- 
ing on his side, he coiled himself 
immediately into a fetal ball. 

T hen it all stopped. There was 
silence from the Earth, but 
around her Lyn could hear the low 
moans and whimpers of the 
wounded or panic-stricken. Amal 
was still crouched on all fours. Hal 
still coiled. 

Her watch had skittered closer. 
She reached over and picked it up. 
It read 1:55 and the second hand 
was moving, but the shaking must 
have injured its mainspring. She 
would take it to a jeweler as soon 
as she returned to Los Angeles. In 
the distance her Dunemaster ap- 
peared undamaged, though it was 
now headed east instead of south. 
Then she remembered that 
AmaTs emergency kit was still in 
the hermit’s cave and stood up. 

Men had less presence of mind 
than women, she decided. Amal 
and Hal were still waiting for the 
Earth to stop and it had quit shak- 
ing ten minutes ago. 

She walked toward Cathedral 
Rocks, weaving among the Skin- 
heads. Some were sitting. Some 
were crouched. Most were lying 
coiled on the ground. 

“Rise and shine, folks,” she 
called cheerfully. “It’s all over.” 

No one rose and shining would 
have been difficult in any event. 
Everyone was covered with a 
layer of dust. A woman coiled on 
her side, her hands locked behind 



her neck, was calling through her 
kneecaps, “Praise the Lord!” 

Lyn thought it a silly sugges- 
tion. The Lord was not a flattery- 
seeker. The woman was carrying 
anthropomorphism a bit too far. 

In one of those odd quirks which 
sometimes attend cyclones and 
other natural disasters, she 
found that Moon Boy had been 
bounced twenty meters from his 
original position and was sitting 
in his lotus position out on the 
grass, swaying right and left. For 
all Moon Boy knew there had 
never been an earthquake. 

The hermit’s ignorance was for 
the best, she decided, for he had 
lost his cave. Where there had been 
a crevice in the rocks was now a 
cleft in a granite brow. Cathedral 
Rocks no longer deserved the 
title — the steeple was gone. 

She found Amal’s backpack 
where she had left it, partially 
covered with debris. As she 
cleared the shards from the kit she 
could hear coughing and sneezing 
behind her. The people were be- 
ginning to ask about each other. 

She retrieved Amal’s kit and 
started back, passing a woman 
who looked up at her and said, 
“God has visited His wrath on the 
LA. P.D.” 

A man nearby added: “Yeah, 
but He didn’t do too well by the 
faithful.” 

Lyn said to the man, “Hey, you. 
Get your pals and put Moon Boy 
back in his place.” 

“Yes, ma’am,” the man said, 
rising. “Then what do we do?” 

“Rally around Moon Boy,” she 
answered promptly. 

She strode on down the mea- 



62 



GALAXY 




dow. The mountain seemed to have 
righted itself. Hal was sitting up, 
his elbows on his knees-, not doing 
anything. Amal was still crouched 
on all fours. She walked up to him, 
patted his head, hung the kit 
around his neck and snapped her 
fingers in front of him, “Up, boy! 
There’s your leash.” 

He rose to his feet, asking, 
“What happened?” 

“You’re the seismologist and 
you’re asking me what happened? 
We had an earthquake, you idiot! 
On the Richter scale — a rip- 
snorter.” 

“I mean why did it happen? It 
was supposed to hit at one thirty- 
three.” 

“That was the first one,” she 
said, “The second one started at 
one fifty-three, shook for fifteen 
minutes and was over at one fifty- 
five.” 

Lyn was telling him what she be- 
lieved. She would never accept the 
official version that Great Frazier 
lasted two minutes and eighteen 
seconds. 

“Where are the police?” he 
asked. 

“Smote by God’s wrath. Hal, get 
up.” 

Everyone seemed eager to obey 
her commands. Hal leaped to his 
feet, clapping his hands. “Yep. 
Got to get over to Cal Tech and dig 
out the data for my bit story.” 

“Red Benton’s already there,” 
she said, “to seize the black files 
for his group action at law.” 

“Forget the black files,” Amal 
said. “We’ve got to get away be- 
fore the police recover.” 

“They’ll be grateful to you for 
prophesying this,” Lyn said. 



“They won’t be and 1 didn’t 
prophesy this.” Eyeing her intent- 
ly, he added: “I’ll drive.” 

“I’m perfectly capable of driv- 
ing my own car.” 

“You’re not — and you’ll know it 
later.” 

Amal had taken over and she 
grew docile. 

T he Dunemaster started and 
she was glad Amal had the 
wheel. She wanted to savor the ex- 
hilaration she gained from find- 
ing herself one of a happy band of 
brothers who had fought with 
Harry on St. Crispin’s Day. She 
was still feeling excited as Amal 
trundled the Dunemaster onto 
Mirror Lake Road, now a tat- 
tered ribbon of asphalt covered at 
intervals by landslides, but her 
buoyancy was sinking fast. She 
was feeling herself collapse in- 
side and her hands were starting to 
shake. 

They rolled finally onto the free- 
way and turned south toward Los 
Angeles. For miles downgrade the 
freeway stretched completely 
empty and she grew slightly irri- 
tated when the forebrain of Leroy 
Thatcher did not immediately 
tromp on the gas and head for Cal 
Tech. Amal was driving like a lit- 
tle old lady from Pasadena, she 
thought, barely doing thirty when 
he passed the median strip where 
she had made a U-turn at 300. 
Even so, he was slowing down. 

“Are we going to park?” she 
asked as he pulled off the road and 
swung up the embankment. 

He smiled and pointed downhill. 
She looked below and could see 
where a bandsaw had neatly 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

sliced all freeway lanes — the 
southern segment was fifteen 
feet below the northern segment. 
At the base of the drop-off, which 
had been invisible from above, she 
saw her first traffic casualty. The 
camera truck of the L.A. Spec- 
tacular Department formed a 
crumpled exclamation point at 
the end of a skid mark on the con- 
crete. It had somersaulted from 
the drop at high speed and slid on 
its roof for fifteen meters along 
the concrete. 

Obliquely she recognized that 
she was malfunctioning mental- 
ly, for her first thought was that the 
cameramen inside had missed 
two opportunities for some sensa- 
tional footage of highway ac- 
tion — hers and theirs. 

“How did you know the freeway 
was broken?” 

“I didn’t. I knew the fault line 
was there.” 

“Tell me. Can you really dodge 
bullets?” 

“Of course not. My vision’s keen 
enough to watch a rifleman’s trig- 
ger finger. When it flexes I leap 
aside.” 

She remembered her vision of 
the falling stanchions and com- 
mented, “I told you I could see the 
stanchions fall.” 

“You were seeing the wrong 
earthquake. We were above the 
epicenter. No towers in the basin 
fell.” 

“How do you know we were 
above the epicenter?” 

“The way the L waves merged 
with the S' waves.” 

“If you noticed that you must 
have lost your earthquake 
phobia.” 



“It was the last thing I 
noticed — until you snapped your 
fingers.” 

His answers were brusque. The 
forebrain of Leroy Thatcher was 
taking over. Amal was concen- 
trating on driving and the roar 
from the windstream was making 
conversation difficult. Out of the 
corner of his mouth he shouted 
over to Hal, “Get on the Valley 
State frequency and let me know 
when we’re in range.” 

“Aye, aye, sir,” Hal answered 
and he wasn’t being facetious. He 
turned to the emergency kit be- 
hind him, brought out a walkie- 
talkie and began to twist its dial, 
checking from a small book he 
pulled from his shirt pocket. The 
book had a list of radio fre- 
quencies assigned to the different 
towers. 

An extensive conspiracy had 
been organized behind her back, 
Lyn could tell, for even Hal’s radio 
log was printed. It galled her to 
realize how accurately all others 
had recognized her so quickly for 
what she had been, a gullible, over- 
idealistic political groupy, and had 
cordoned her off from any active 
part in the operation. Yet her in- 
ner chagrin was not so great that 
she could not lean back and enjoy 
the ride at 355 k.p.h., the limit on 
the speedometer dial. 

PPROACHING Sylmar, they 
had their first view of the San 
Fernando Valley — a dust cloud 
hanging in the sky. At the Foot- 
hill Freeway Interchange the first 
collapsed overpass emerged from 
the dust blocking the San Diego 
Freeway to the south, but Amal 




64 



GALAXY 




was navigating the Dunemaster 
with eclat. He angled across the 
median strip and zoomed off the 
on-ramp onto the wrong lane of 
the Foothill Freeway, which at 
this point had been rippled into 
corrugations by a disturbance in 
the Sylmar Fault. 

At Sylmar the first metropoli- 
tan tower emerged from the dust 
on their left. From the fifth floor 
up to the turret restaurant the 
stanchion stems were completely 
stripped of modules. Southeast the 
freeway was stained with red blobs 
where pods had struck the con- 
crete and bounced into the woods 
to the south. One crumpled pod 
was imbedded into the median 
strip and off to the right another 
had crushed an oak. 

An impression of the awesome 
force of the earthquake was seep- 
ing into Lyn’s consciousness. 
Amal’s phobia was the most justi- 
fiable mental aberration she had 
ever encountered — she knew her 
subconscious was saturated with a 
fear so strong it was cutting out 
her recollection of the heaving 
mountain. In a literal sense, twice 
over, her recent experiences were 
only a blur. If she ever sorted out 
and recalled her memories, she 
and Amal would have one other 
thing in common, temblorphobia. 

Hal called out, “Valley State’s 
coming through.’’ 

“Request them to relay a mes- 
sage to Cal Tech: Nils meet Amal 
at Charlie-four in ten minutes.” 

Hal raised Valley State and a 
young but surprisingly calm voice 
answered, “Valley State here. Go 
ahead. Over.” 

Hal transmitted Amal’s request 



and was answered, “Wilco. Re- 
gards to Amal. Out.” 

“He’s violating procedures,” 
Amal said, obviously irritated by 
the personal greeting. Amal was 
slowing. Wrecked and abandoned 
cars were beginning to spot the 
freeway. 

“Why are you meeting Nils?” 
Lyn asked. 

“He’s second in command,” 
Amal said. He was smiling. “He 
wanted me arrested so he could 
get my job.” 

Actually it took them over twen- 
ty minutes to reach Cal Tech. 
More autos and pods from the 
Eagle Rock Tower were littering 
the freeway. Several overpasses 
were down and the bridge over 
Arroyo Seco was out. As they 
trundled over the brow of the ra- 
vine and down its sides they could 
pick up the Cal Tech signals loud 
and clear. So far, Lyn had yet to 
see a human being, dead or alive, 
but she knew from transmissions 
that people were in the woods. 

“Morphine at baker-four, urgent 
. Restraint jacket at dog-two . 
German shepherd at easy-six.” 

Most ominous of all was the call: 
“Six plastic bags at fox-one.” 

She dreaded what they would 
find among the trees as Amal drove 
south on Lake. Fallen tree limbs 
lined the avenue. Except for the 
layer of dust over everything, 
Pasadena might have been struck 
by a hurricane. 

To the southeast she saw the 
stanchion at Cal Tech tower lifting 
to the pleasure dome. It was not as 
hard hit as the Sylmar Tower. A 
few residential pods still dangled 
from their stems on the southwest 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



65 




and northeast sides of the 
stanchion, some as high as the 30th 
floor, she estimated. Farther be- 
low, the two-stem administrative 
pods had mostly held — though 
staggered away from the stan- 
chion — but gaps were showing as 
low as the tree line permitted her 
to see. 

Amal angled across the Lake 
California intersection and drove 
down a park mall as far as the fall- 
en pods and crushed trees per- 
mitted. To her left, at the base of 
the tower, the pods had fallen into 
a jumbled mass reaching as high 
as the fifth floor. The naked 
grotesqueness of the tower reach- 
ing into the rapidly clearing sky, 
the crumpled pods and crushed 
trees nearer at hand, sickened 
her. 

She was glad when Amal 
stopped the car and, with packs on 
their backs, they could walk away 
from the scene into the woods to- 
ward their rendezvous in the safety 
zone. Sun shafts through the trees 
and glinting on dust gave a cathe- 
dral atmosphere to the forest and 
Lyn was beginning to feel at 
peace until they passed a row of 
bodies in black plastic bags laid 
out in an open area by someone 
with a peculiar passion for order. 
All the tied ends of the bags were 
aligned in the same direction and 
from each hung a large shipping 
card covered with notations in 
grease pencil. Lyn turned her eyes 
away, but noticed Amal ahead of 
her inspecting each body as he 
passed, apparently checking to 
see if the knots were tied properly. 

An organization was at work 
here — and Amal, moving with 



the fluidity of an Indian in his 
moccasins, was the brain behind 
it. Watching him, she under- 
stood his willingness to match 
himself against the hunters. With- 
out the glint of the pistol in his belt 
his camouflage would have hid- 
den him from her view at ten paces. 
If his capture had spared the Earth 
this horror she could have wished 
that he had gone to Angeles Crest. 
More than any other mortal, he 
was master of his fate — Amal 
was invincible. 

Thoughts of the quick and the 
dead brought her peace of sorts un- 
til, farther into the woods, she saw 
a Marymount girl, not over fif- 
teen, whose blue uniform was sil- 
vered with dust. Aimlessly, end- 
lessly, the little girl was shuffling 
around the bole of a beech, her 
head to the ground. She had lifted 
the front of her skirt to her mouth 
and was chewing its hem. Spittle 
drooling from the corners of her 
lips had drawn two white lines 
through the dust on her chin and 
her eyes were wild. 

Sensing Lyn’s impulse to go to 
the girl’s aid, Amal called back, 
“Let her be, Lyn. She’ll recover. 
She’s lucky. She’s out of it.” 

Amal’s words hinted obliquely 
at his own horror of this disaster. 

ILS LARSEN waited for Amal 
outside a pyramidal tent 
anchored in the center of four 
equidistant trees. The two shook 
hands in formal greeting, not 
cordially, and Nils led them in- 
side. Near the centerpole, a large 
plot map of the tower area was 
spread over a bridge table. In one 
corner stood a rack containing 




66 



GALAXY 




four laser torches and beside the 
rack lay four canvas bags. In an- 
other corner a radioman ’wearing 
earphones sat on a camp chair be- 
fore a portable radio transmitter. 
He did not look up. He was taking 
notes on a pad. 

Amal’s first question was, 
“Who decides the dead are dead 
before the bodies are bagged?” 

“Medical students from Covina. 
We have only four doctors at the 
field hospital. They’re swamped.” 

Amal nodded, not in agreement 
but to indicate he had heard, and 
asked Nils to brief him on the 
situation. As Nils spoke Amal lis- 
tened intently. 

Few occupants had returned to 
the tower after Little Palmdale 
hit. Some feared the smaller quake 
was merely a preliminary. Oth- 
ers, caught in the park with sup- 
plies, stayed to picnic. Many stu- 
dents were well on their way to get- 
ting stoned when the big quake hit. 
Pot or alcohol had reduced the 
original fourteen five-man rescue 
squads to ten, because Nils had re- 
fused to issue laser torches to any- 
one under the influence. 

“Where are the rescue squads?” 
Amal asked. 

Nils pointed them out on the 
map coordinates. At the moment 
they were working away from the 
stanchion midway in the north- 
west and southeast danger areas. 

Nils estimated that ten per cent 
of the student body and twenty per 
cent of the faculty had remained in 
the tower and were assumed dead. 
Side pods, bouncing into the 
fringes of the safety zone, had 
killed three persons on the ground. 
Most of the patients in the field 



hospital were serious shock victims. 

At one point Nils veered from 
the objectivity of the briefing 
with a Severnian metaphor. “On 
each L wave the upper pods were 
volleying between here and the 
Pasadena tower. I felt like an ant 
watching a tennis match.” 

Some oddities had developed. 
The main water valve to the tower 
had been closed, but gravity pres- 
sure in the mains was keeping a 
flow to the park drinking foun- 
tains. Electric power was still 
available and Nils had heard the 
stanchion elevators were still run- 
ning. 

“Heard?” Amal ejaculated. 
“Didn’t you find out?” Then he 
waved aside his own question and 
Nils continued. 

There had been some looting. A 
few students were peddling mari- 
juana and whisky in the park. 
Medical supplies were running 
low. A shortage of plastic bags 
was developing. Red Benton en- 
tered the tent, the dust on his face 
clotted with sweat. Silently he 
shook hands with Hal, nodded to 
Lyn and stood listening to Nils. 

Amal did not turn to shake 
hands with Red until Nils had fin- 
ished. Brushing aside Benton’s 
compliments on his escape from 
the police, Amal asked abruptly, 
“Is the elevator operating?” 

“To the twentieth floor at least. I 
was up checking the genetics 
pod.” 

“Did you get the black files?” 
Hal asked. 

“Not out of that module.” Red 
shook his head. “Its Y stem was 
bent to the shape of a tuning fork 
and it’s hanging to the last four 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



67 




meters of stem. When I saw Lyn’s 
Dunemaster coming I came 
down to get help.” 

“Forget the black files,” Amal 
said. “No one’s going above the 
tenth floor. One after-jolt and 
those upper pods will fall.” He 
turned back to Nils. “I’m bringing 
in the rescue squads to search the 
modules that held. There may be 
survivors in them. There are noth- 
ing but bodies in the fallen pods.” 
He went to the radio, turned on 
the transmitter mike and spoke 
with calm authority, “Attention, 
all sectors. This is Amal Severn. 
Rescue squads report to the com- 
mand post — on the double. 
Medicos, use plastic bags only for 
dismembered bodies. Marshals, 
seize all supplies of marijuana 
and whisky and take them to the 
medical supply depot. Apprehend 
any besides medicos using hypo- 
dermic needles . .” 

A mal was the general com- 
manding, foreseeing problems 
and eliciting solutions. Even as 
she admired him, Lyn wished he 
were more selfish. 

True, an after-shock might jolt 
some modules loose. On the other 
hand, the genetics department 
module might hang for a week, giv- 
ing the Eugenics Surveillance 
Agency time to recover and re- 
organize. That agency’s primary 
mission would be to recover the 
black files. If it succeeded, if 
Amal’s genetic card were restored 
to official hands she and he would 
never know a normal family life. 
Nor would her child. 

Amal had finished with the 
mike. He turned and tapped the 



shoulder of the radio operator. 

Galncing up, the radioman 
recognized Amal, removed his 
headset and rose. 

“What’s the situation on the out- 
side, Jerry?” 

“Grim, Amal. San Francisco felt 
it. San Diego was hit badly. Long 
Beach is gone with Los Angeles.” 
“Any word from the Bishop 
Seismological Lab?” 

“Yes. There was a ground wave 
shortly before the Great Frazier 
jolt. It was pinpointed at Cal Edi- 
son’s mohole three. Preliminary 
readouts project back to an 
atomic explosion in the Tehachapi 
pile. Something about a modu- 
lated laser wave sending incor- 
rect signals to the pile right after 
Little Palmdale hit.” 

Lyn glanced at Amal and saw his 
face turn pale. He turned to Nils 
and asked suddenly, “Where’s 
Heywood?” 

“Dead.” Nils shrugged. “His 
body’s somewhere near Pomona. 
He stayed in his pod.” 

All of Amal’s interest seemed to 
become focused on the black files 
he had previously dismissed. 

“Where are the secret genetic 
cards kept?” 

“In a tungsten steel combina- 
tion safe,” Nils said, “weighing 
over a thousand kilograms. Only 
Heywood had the combination.” 
“We’re going after it and burn it 
open,” .^mal said. “There are four 
of us and the spare rescue ap- 
paratus. I’ll carry the block and 
tackle and the gangplank.” 

“There are five of us,” Lyn in- 
terjected, “and I can carry the 
gangplank.” 

She had watched steeplejacks 



68 



GALAXY 




install the prefabricated modules 
on the tower stems and knew the 
gangplank, a folding board laid 
to traverse from one stem to an- 
other, though immensely strong, 
was light. 

“You stay at the command 
post,” Amal ordered. “It’s not safe 
up there.” 

“That’s why I’m going. To pro- 
tect you.” 

The others laughed and Amal 
was smiling when a youth wear- 
ing a hard hat with a grappling 
line coiled over his shoulder ap- 
peared in the entrance of the tent. 

“You called in the rescue 
squads, Amal.” 

“Yes, Hank,” Amal said, step- 
ping outside. “1 want you to 
search the pods on the tower for 
survivors — from the tenth floor 
down.” 

Lyn followed Amal. Other res- 
cue crews were coming from the 
woods, checking in, and Amal 
waited for a moment to address 
them as a group. He completed his 
instructions on a note of caution. 
“Stay close to the entrances. If the 
tower starts to shake run to the 
corridor circle and hang on.” 

Dismissed, the crews made for 
the tower and Amal turned to go 
back into the tent. Lyn grasped his 
arm. “Why were you asking about 
Heywood.” 

“1 intended to kill him.” 

“He wasn’t personally respon- 
sible for AE Seven.” 

“No, but he knew about me and 
he did nothing. He could have 
stopped me a month ago.” 

“Why should he have stopped 
you? You’ve possibly saved a mil- 
lion lives by predicting the quake.” 



“No,” Amal said calmly. “I 
didn’t predict this earthquake. I 
predicted Little Palmdale. 1 
caused this earthquake, by in- 
stalling a stress sensor on the Gar- 
lock Fault. But I’m not morally 
responsible. Remember that 
while we’re being married on Sun- 
day — if Brother Barnes is still 
alive.” 

He had spoken softly, but his in- 
tentness revealed his driving urge 
to clear his conscience of Great 
Frazier. Despite the death and 
destruction for which Amal ad- 
mitted being the agent, Lyn felt a 
surge of joy, a keen, almost 
ecstatic and thoroughly selfish 
wave of happiness. Amal had 
found a new obsession, the drive to 
purge himself of his sense of guilt, 
and he was past the crisis. All oth- 
er AE 7s had died in the cata- 
clysms they created. 

XI 

A t some point in its ascent the 
elevator passed above an upper 
dust level in the atmosphere. Step- 
ping from the lift onto the plat- 
form circling the stanchion which 
had once been the tower’s cor- 
ridor, Amal’s quintet looked over 
the San Gabriel Valley. Dust 
shimmered to the far green of the 
Puente Hills. Eastward the 
skeletal stanchions of Claremont, 
Pomona, Ontario and far San 
Bernardino jutted out of a pall as 
smooth and almost as silvery as a 
lake of mercury. Above was an in- 
credibly clear sky, but because of 
the bulge of the dust mantle Lyn 
could not see Catalina. 

Red Benton had prepared her for 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



69 




her first view of the genetics de- 
partment’s double module. The L 
waves from Great Frazier had 
sheared its connecting pins and 
flung it outward. The welded 
module’s twin stems, projecting 
from the stanchion at different 
angles, had held in the plasti-steel 
grooves along its base, but barely. 
The V of the module’s stems were 
bent to an elongated U. The pod 
was being held fourteen meters 
from the corridor platform on the 
tips of the two fingerlike ex- 
tension girders of structural steel. 
The door of the module, directly 
between the steel fingers, which 
were eight meters apart, opened 
now onto a twenty-floor drop. 

It was Lyn’s job, as the crew 
member who carried the gang- 
plank, to walk one of the / beams 
to the pod, unfold the plank and 
bridge the extenders so the crew 
could reach the door between the 
girders. Positive that Amal would 
try to stop her from walking the 
beam, she slipped the backpack 
from her shoulders, removed the 
plank and walked onto the girder 
while the others were still admir- 
ing the scenic phenomenon. 

Turning, Amal saw her and 
called, “Don’t look down.’’ 

But she had already looked. 

From below, the module ap- 
peared to be low on the stanchion. 
From above, looking down 
through the jutting girders, an in- 
finity of emptiness dropped to the 
next pod, seven floors below. 
When she moved her gaze slightly 
outward the infinity was cubed, 
stretching downward forever to 
the green grass of eternity. The I 
beam she traversed had been a full 



meter wide when she started — it 
had shrunk to half its original 
width. Correspondingly, the four- 
teen meters to the module wall had 
doubled to twenty-eighC 

She silently swore by the ghost 
of Susan B. Anthony that any- 
thing a man could do she could do 
as well, but the ploy failed her 
when she recalled that most men 
could not do this — steeplejacks 
were largely recruited from Mo- 
hawk Indians in a tribal enclave 
near Utica, New York. 

So she thought: Anything a Mo- 
hawk Indian can do a woman can 
do as well . 

The fallacy in her premise was so 
self-evident she had to switch her 
self-inspirational methods be- 
fore she could make it to the 
module wall, where she flipped 
open the plank and laid it across 
the beams. As she stooped there to 
adjust the safety hooks, carefully 
keeping her eyes to the hori- 
zontal, her courage was sustained 
by a rapidly muttered Lord’s 
Prayer alternated with the Twen- 
ty-third Psalm. 

Still crouching, clinging to the 
secured board, she turned ginger- 
ly on the beam and stood up, forc- 
ing a nonchalant smile to her face 
as she began her way back to the 
platform. But no gallery stood 
there, open-mouthed with admira- 
tion, to applaud her feat. Amal 
had gone to the floor above and 
was walking the beam over her 
head, carrying a block and tackle. 
Hal, not far behind, trailed a line 
and a cargo net for lifting the safe. 
Red was attaching a pulley to an 
eyebolt welded to the stanchion 
wall. Nils was strolling out on the I 



70 



GALAXY 




beam opposite to hers, cradling 
the laser rod in his arms. With in- 
sufferable indifference to height, 
they were behaving as if they had 
been conceived and delivered on 
the high iron. She reached the plat- 
form, vowing never to walk a 
beam again. 

Keeping close to the stanchion, 
holding the rail of the stairway, 
she felt there was a lesson in 
psychology to be learned here. 
Each of these daredevils was well 
motivated — Hal had his Pulitzer 
Prize dream, Red a law career and 
Amal wanted to assuage his guilt 
feelings by placing the responsibil- 
ity for Great Frazier on the genet- 
icists. And Nils wanted to atone 
for the betrayal of a friend. All 
that moved her was a mild curios- 
ity about the genesis of her grand- 
mother and the desire to protect a 
lover who needed no protection. 
Her motivation was weak. 

B efore she had justified her 
cowardice Nils had burned a 
hole through the door, reached in 
and swung it open, stepping in, 
and Amal had hooked the block 
and tackle to the beam above. Hal 
was behind Amal on his beam, 
carrying the cargo net and paying 
out the towline. She wondered if 
the two would attempt to 
maneuver past each other on the 
same beam — but, no, Amal 
dropped to the roof of the genetics 
pod and swung himself down 
through the doorway. 

She heard Nils call to Amal, 
“We’re in luck. Here’s a dolly.’’ 
Amal reappeared in the door- 
way and looked up at Hal, string- 
ing the block and tackle and hook- 



ing on the cargo net. He started to 
lower the net and Amal called im- 
patiently, “Throw it.’’ 

Hal tossed the net. Amal caught 
it, began to spread it near the 
doorway, and Hal, using Amal’s 
short cut, swung down to assist. 
Lyn gained the impression that 
Hal was trying to beat Red to the 
black files to establish a prior 
claim, because Red was just start- 
ing to walk Lyn’s beam. 

Then all were lost to her view 
and from the interior she could 
hear in unison, “Heave! Heave! 
Heave!’’ as they tilted the safe on- 
to the dolly. 

Nils emerged first from the 
doorway, nursing his laser torch 
in his arms. After him came Hal 
and Red, walking the beams back 
to the platform. Amal appeared 
in the doorway, trundling the safe 
and the dolly onto the cargo net. 
On the platform now. Nils placed 
the laser around the bend in the 
corridor, pointing its pulse end 
away from the stanchion, and 
turned to join the other two at the 
end of the towline. 

Amal called from the doorway, 
“Heave away — ” 

Still- clinging to the stair rail, 
Eyn acted as observer as the three 
men hauled away at the line, draw- 
ing in the slack. Amal stood by to 
guide the safe around the door 
frame because the upper beam 
from which the hoist hung was off- 
set above the doorway. Then the 
safe, huge, black, swung free of the 
pod and the men on the stanchion 
were hauling away, bringing it as 
close to the elevator door as the 
pulley permitted before they let 
it thump to the platform. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Amal folded the gangplank and 
had started down the beam toward 
the platform, when the tower be- 
gan to quiver from an aftershock. 
He tossed the folded plank into 
space and leaned forward to grip 
the edges of the I beam. Lyn 
thought the shear waves were act- 
ing strangely for those of an af- 
tershock. The building was con- 
tinuing to quiver and no long wave 
had struck. 

Amal shouted to her, “Grab the 
rail, Lyn, and crouch. It’s Ingle- 
wood — Inglewood — Inglewood.” 

She crouched. She had long been 
holding the stair rail. Not under- 
standing what he was shouting 
about, she looked southwest be- 
yond the Civic Center towers to 
the stanchion of Inglewood Tower 
rising above the dust line. The 
stanchion was so remote and tiny 
in the distance it was if she were 
viewing it through the wrong end 
of a telescope. As she watched it 
swayed, righted itself and swayed 
again. Very slowly, at first, it 
tilted and she saw it fall. 

Her vision from the trance was 
given a new dimension in reality 
by her waking knowledge. She 
understood the meaning of 
Amal’s cry — and more. The New- 
port-Inglewood Fault had slipped. 
The Inglewood stanchion astride 
the fault had fallen. Amal was ten 
meters out on a bare girder. Ingle- 
wood would be a delayed ex- 
tension of Great Frazier, which had 
been caused by the explosion in 
mohole three. An L wave was ap- 
proaching, one as powerful as 
that which had made the mountain 
dance — and all AE 7s had died in 
the cataclysms they created. 



S HE could see the first L wave 
coming by a trailing ripple in 
the atmospheric dust. In front of 
the wave the striated dust lay sil- 
very in the sunlit air — behind the 
wave the dust was moiling into 
dirty grays and browns. Far in ad- 
vance of the churning air the long 
wave hit. 

A breeze struck her face. The 
horizon to the south tilted, lifted 
upward, steadied itself, then 
swung far below her as a breeze 
rustled against the nape of her 
neck. The stanchion creaked. 
Girders swished. Behind her she 
heard the safe topple from the 
dolly. A clunk sounded in the 
elevator shaft. Then the popping 
sounds began, followed by metal- 
lic clanks she had heard in her 
trance, and she recognized the 
sound. Rivets were breaking from 
the stanchion to roll across the 
platform and clatter among the 
girders. 

The blur of a pod falling from a 
higher level plummeted across her 
line of vision, which was focused 
on the Civic Center, rising and 
falling on the southern horizon. 
The stanchions were standing, 
though the broken strands of the 
pedestrian walkway flapped from 
their sides as they swayed. 

She kept her gaze on the central 
towers. As long as they stood, the 
tower she rode would stand, for the 
Civic Center towers were closer 
to the epicenter. 

Time congealed around her. 
There were no P waves to bounce 
her. The 5 waves were absorbed 
by the sickening sway of her vast, 
upside-down swing. No roar came 
from the Earth — only the hail- 



72 



GALAXY 




stone rattle of rivets was sound- 
ing, the creak of the stanchion, the 
swish of the girders. She saw only 
the Civic Center towers rising and 
falling in the southern horizon. 

The sway was lessening. The 
rivets were popping at a slower 
tempo. Southward the Civic Cen- 
ter towers were still standing. A 
final shuddering creak, a final dip 
to the horizon — and there was 
silence. 

Once she was sure it was over she 
felt composed and self-possessed. 
This time her composure was not 
the euphoria of shock but arose 
from the calm objectivity of an 
earthquake veteran. She ap- 
praised her situation. Two great 
earthquakes in one day were real- 
ly just too much. Now that she had 
lost Amal she would be free to 
move, and prudence dictated her 
withdrawal from the land of shak- 
ing Earth. She would leave Cali- 
fornia, she decided — she had 
heard some nice things about 
Phoenix. Rising, she looked over 
to the girder where Amal had been. 

Amal was still there. 



B ehind him reared the slopes 
of the San Gabriel Mountains 
slithering with a downfall of dust 
and rocks. The genetics pod had 
fallen, shearing the girder barely 
a meter behind his feet. 

She walked to the edge of the 
platform and called, “It’s over, 
darling.” 

He did not hear her. The mus- 
cles of his forearms bulged be- 
neath his sleeves from the force of 
his grip on the / beam. His eyes 
were vacant. Strangely, his face 



was as clean as if it had been fresh- 
ly washed and it was chalky white. 
“Amal, it’s over. Come in.” 
“He’s in shock,” Nils Larsen 
said beside her. “His phobia has 
him locked in. We could be a thou- 
sand miles away.” 

“I’ll unlock him,” she said. 

Once more she went out on the 
beam, crawling this time, oblivious 
to the emptiness beneath her, 
though now it stretched to the low- 
ermost pods of the almost com- 
pletely stripped stanchion. 

With her face an arm’s length 
from his, he still did not see her. 
His gaze was focused on some 
private hell. Sweat pouring from 
his face had cleaned it. His 
knuckles were white from the 
strain of gripping the I beam. 

Patting his hand, she spoke in a 
low, soothing voice. “Darling, it’s 
all over. You’ve survived the 
crisis. You’re safe now — with 
me — and 1 Idve you. Come back 
with me. We have the black files. 
You can lead a normal life now. 
The experiment is over.” 

He was still not hearing her. 
“Darling, come back to the plat- 
form with me,” she whispered. “I 
need you. I’m going to have your 
child. Your son will need you, too, 
to teach him to hunt gazelles.” 

He quivered. Some of her words 
were getting through to him. She 
made her strongest move. 

“Your mother’s alive. She never 
died in an earthquake. They 
tricked you into believing it, 
Amal. They tricked her into think- 
ing you were dead. But she’s alive. 
She wants to see her favorite son. 
I’ll take you to visit her.” 

Tears formed in his eyes. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



73 




She had kept her voice low, part- 
ly to soothe Amal and partly to 
keep the others on the platform 
from overhearing her. Now from 
behind her Nils spoke with harsh 
urgency. 

“Get back, Lyn. He’ll fall if he 
comes out of it on the girder. Let 
me hook a safety line around him. 
We can hoist him to the plat- 
form.” 

Nils was speaking the truth. 
Standing, she turned and strode 
rapidly back to the platform, 
clearing the beam for Nils who 
went out, straddled the girder and 
snaked the safety line under 
Amal’s chest. Hooking its catch, 
he called over his shoulder, “Haul 
away.” 

As the line went taut Nils 
slapped Amal’s wrists and barked, 
“Let go, Amal.” 

Obediently Amal released his 
grip. Nils steadied his body as it 
rose, swung out over space, and 
Red and Hal reeled him onto the 
platform. Red secured the line on 
the eyebolt and let Amal dangle 
near the stanchion, head and shoul- 
ders sagging, his body convulsing 
with sobs, his feet dragging the 
platform. Lyn went to him to swab 
the perspiration from his fore- 
head. 

“Let him hang there for a while 
and cry it off,” Red said. “I’ve seen 
forty like him today.” 



N ils walked up and looked at 
Amal, saying, “It’s a form of 
battle fatigue. He’s got to be the 
bravest Coptic Christian alive, 
considering the conditioning the 
department gave him. He should 



have cracked up over Little Palm- 
dale.”. 

“He damned near did,” Hal 
Carpenter said. “Then he snapped 
out of Great Frazier ahead of Lyn 
and me.” 

Suddenly Lyn was admiring the 
calm professionalism of the trio, 
particularly Nils. Quake veter- 
ans all, they had sized up the situa- 
tion calmly and gone about rescu- 
ing Amal with efficiency and dis- 
patch. 

“I want to thank you all,” she 
said. “Especially you. Nils. If you 
hadn’t stopped me from waking 
him on the girder we both might 
have fallen. For this I might even 
pay your rent on a gynodrone we 
know.” 

Neither Hal nor Red, from 
U.S.C., would have caught her 
reference to the other Lyn 
Oberlin on the Cal Tech campus. 

“I might have wished for an even 
more gracious gesture,” Nils said. 
“But if you can bring Amal 
through this I’ll be happy.” 

“Don’t you think he’s past his 
crisis?” she asked, remembering 
that Nils knew more about the ex- 
periment than she. 

“I think so. Surely I hope so. 
I’ve done some deep think- 
ing — deep for me, that is — since 
last night. From the records of the 
other AE Sevens it appears that 
the Thanatos Eactor creates more 
than a death wish, rather a form of 
idolatrous necrophilia. Maybe, 
since they came from the dead, 
they’re loyal to the dead. Even so, 
there’s been enough death today to 
placate the most blue-blooded 
Prince of Darkness. And with you 
on this side of the veil — if he still 



74 



GALAXY 




craves the other side he deserves 
any grave he can get.” 

His tone suddenly turned 
serious. “You’re his best hope, 
Lyn. Haven’t you turned me into a 
traitor to my department?” 

“Nils,” Red said, “the elevator’s 
out of order.” 

“No matter. We’ll open the safe 
up here. You and Hal unhook the 
cargo net and I’ll get the laser.” 

Lyn turned her attention to 
Amal. The sweat was no longer 
pouring from his face. His sobs 
were subsiding and he was losing 
his pallor. He was still hanging 
from the line, his arms dangling, 
his head drooping. She rubbed his- 
hands and whispered encourage- 
ment to him. She saw his knees 
stiffen, his face contort as he 
fought for control. He lifted his 
head. His eyes were coming into 
focus though they reminded her of 
those of a sleepwalker suddenly 
awakened. 

Returning with the laser, Nils 
glanced over and said, “He’s com- 
ing to.” 

Amal shuffled to his feet with a 
visible effort. The line around his 
chest went slack. 

Looking at the safe. Nils won- 
dered aloud, “From what 1 re- 
member of the design of safes — 
I’ll probably have to burn away 
the whole front door.” 

Suddenly Amal spoke, his voice 
hoarse and indifferent. “Burn a 
concave hole through the metal 
around the lock, lift out the lock 
and then manipulate the bolts by 
hand.” 

“Our captain has returned,” 
Nils said. He set about burning a 
circle at a slant angle around the 



lock. The steel hissed as Nils cut 
his preliminary circle. 



A mal had not fully returned. 

His hand was clinging to hers in 
an uncharacteristic gesture of 
dependence. Below the sound of 
the laser he asked, “Did I freeze?” 
“For a little while. Nils hooked a 
line under your arms and the oth- 
er boys pulled you in.” 

“The remaining pods must have 
fallen onto the safety zone,” he 
said. “What about the rescue 
squads I sent to the tower?” 

“They had plenty of warning 
before the long wave hit. I’m sure 
they’re safe.” 

He nodded vacantly, either in 
agreement or to show he had 
heard, and said, “I froze. You must 
think me a coward.” 

“Of course not, dear. We all un- 
derstand your phobia. Nils even 
complimented you on your 
bravery. He was surprised that 
you didn’t go into shock at Little 
Palmdale.” 

“He should know,” Amal said. 
“He’s memorized my genetic 
code.” 

A note of bitterness in his re- 
mark alarmed her. “Nils saved 
your life, Amal. He put the rope 
around you.” 

“Too bad he didn’t bring a 
genetics department straitjacket.” 
She was losing her fear for Amal 
and becoming fearful for Nils. 
“Darling, don’t be bitter. We’re 
getting your black card now. Once 
it’s out of official hands you can 
lead a normal life.” 

“As a genetic freak?” 

“Hush. You’re disturbed. In one 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



75 




way or the other, we’re all genetic 
freaks.” 

“But there’s only one Prince of 
the Dead,” he said. 

He had heard Nils’ remark 
through his coma and remem- 
bered it. Yet he seemed resigned in 
his bitterness, even docile. The 
rope was still around him and he 
was making no attempt to re- 
move it. Without disengaging his 
hand, she reached behind him and 
unsnapped it, letting it fall. As 
she fumbled with the catch the 
laser ceased to hiss. 

Wearing a gauntlet. Nils lifted 
the combination dial and reached 
inside to manipulate the bolts. He 
opened the door. From inside he 
lifted a metal filing case that 
resembled an oversized safety de- 
posit box and held it aloft. 

“Here they are. When the boys 
from Eugenics Surveillance find 
the pod they’ll find the safe miss- 
ing. When they find the safe they’ll 
find the files missing. By then the 
files, minus Amal’s card, will be 
with the U.N.’s Scientific Ethics 
Bureau. The printouts will be in 
the hands of our legal beagle and 
journalistic hawkshaw. After 
that a former member of the gene- 
tics department. Nils Larsen, will 
be applying for a job as street 
sweeper in Phoenix, Arizona . 
Counselor, you take charge of the 
files — you’re big and strong. We’ll 
leave everything but the laser for 
the next residents of Los 
Angeles.” 

An air of light-headed gaiety in- 
fused the group, with the excep- 
tion of Amal who was still pre- 
occupied. Red Benton slid the 
heavy files into the backpack for 



the gangplank and hoisted them to 
his shoulders. 

Nils asked Amal, “Think you 
can make the hike down, old 
buddy?” 

Amal nodded. 

It took them twenty minutes to 
negotiate the winding stairway 
twenty levels to the ground, stop- 
ping once to let Red and Nils rest. 
Lyn stayed on the outside of 
Amal, who still held her hand, and 
she was grateful his eyes were 
fixed on the steps to avoid the 
rivets. On a turning in the upper 
circles she could see clearly that 
one of the remnant pods had fallen 
very close to the field hospital. On 
the ground, she was certain, were 
new casualties. 

At ground level, as they threaded 
their way between the fallen pods 
close to the stanchion, through 
canyons and under arches created 
by the downfall, she noticed 
Amal continued to walk with his 
head down, shuffling, lead-footed. 
His face and eyes were empty of 
expression. 

Though her mind strongly re- 
jected the simile, it kept occurring 
to her that he was acting like a 
zombie. Nils’ words repeated it- 
self in her mind: They were born of 
the dead . they are loyal to the 
dead. 



B eyond the circle of layered 
modules the wreckage grew 
more scattered. Red Benton sug- 
gested another rest period. Nils 
was agreeable — the implement he 
carried was also heavy. Red slid 
the pack from his shoulders onto 
a clear spot in the grass. Nils 



76

squatted, cradling the laser in his 
arms. Amal continued to stand, 
holding her hand, still morose. 

In an effort to snap him from his 
lethargy, she said to Nils, “I’d like 
Amal’s card — right now. I want no 
one reading it.” 

“Red will need it,” Amal mut- 
tered. 

“He can sue in a U.N. Court on 
behalf of the others in Europe and 
Africa.” 

“She’s right, Amal,” Red said. 
“There’s no case against the gene- 
ticists in the United States since 
you're not liable for the earth- 
quakes. Both quakes were an act of 
God.” 

“The files are alphabetical. 
Red,” Nils said. “Give Lyn his 
card.” 

Red lifted the lid and flipped 
along the index. She judged there 
were more than a thousand cards 
in the box. Red found Amal’s, 
plucked it out and handed it to 
Lyn. 

She glanced at it. Except for its 
black border it resembled the 
standard buff-colored genetic 
card, filled with perforations and 
arcane symbols stamped in 
magnetic ink. 

Turning to Amal, she asked, 
“Would you like to tear it up, or 
shall 1 perform the ritual honors?” 

Neither could tear it holding 
hands and she was diplomatically 
hoping for a disengagement. His 
hand had grown cold and clammy. 

He didn’t look at the card. He 
flipped his free hand toward the 
wreckage around them and said, 
“Why destroy it? It can’t restore 
this.” 

Nils was obviously concerned 



about Amal’s continuing depres- 
sion. He stood up, said sharply, 
“You’re talking drivel, Amal. If it 
hadn’t been for that card there’d be 
a lot more bodies in and under 
those pods.” 

Amal lifted his head, “Wrong, 
my good and faithful friend . 
What manner of mind would at- 
tempt an experiment like this one 
when there was no need for it?” 

He had not truly asked the 
question of Nils, but Nils an- 
swered it. 

“You know the scientific mind, 
Amal. These things develop their 
own momentum once they start 
rolling.” 

“And steam-roller humanity,” 
Amal said. 

“You’re a scientist,” Nils said. 
“You know the conventions. Hu- 
manity’s an abstraction. There 
are only people, Lyn, you. Red, 
Hal and — lately — me.” 

“Then why in the hell didn’t you 
stop to think about people?” 



A mal was snapping out of his 
lethargy. Lyn could sense vast 
currents of energy stirring in him, 
swirling around him, as his alert- 
ness returned on a wave of anger. 
His face was growing pale 
again — the veins on his neck stood 
out. Amazed and alarmed by his 
sudden fury. Nils stood and stared 
at him. 

“I’m asking you — geneticist! 
Why weren’t you thinking of Lyn, 
of me, of the dead around us, three 
months ago, before I went into 
mohole three?” 

“Mohole three!” Nils seemed 
stunned by the implication in 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



77 




Amal’s words. He lifted his left 
hand placatingly. “Hold it, Amal. 
Don’t paint me with the same 
brush. I came over to your side, re- 
member?” 

“You came over a little late for 
half a million dead,” Amal 
shouted, dropping Lyn’s hand and 
advancing toward Nils. “What 
were you doing with your knowl- 
edge of me, roommate, while we 
were parsing Arabic sentences?” 

Nils backed away. In a wise but 
unnecessary precaution Hal 
Carpenter reached over and deftly 
removed the pistol from Amal’s 
belt. Had Amal intended to harm 
Nils, Lyn knew, he would have 
used his fists and Nils would have 
been pummeled already, but 
Amal was alert now. He would be 
aware that of all who had gone on 
the tower with him, including 
Lyn, Nils had acted from the least 
selfish motive. 

“Where were you when Madrid 
blew?” Amal yelled. “Johannes- 
burg caved in? Kiev was poisoned?” 

He continued to advance slow- 
ly, battering Nils with his ques- 
tions. Nils, backtracking, kept his 
distance. 

“Where will you be, geneticist, 
when Hamburg — ” 

Lyn never saw the broken / 
beam imbedded in the turf until 
Nils stumbled over it. Falling 
backward he swung the heavy 
laser rod out before him with his 
right hand in an unsuccessful at- 
tempt to balance himself, throw- 
ing his left hand behind him. 
When he clutched the rod his fin- 
ger inserted itself into the trig- 
ger guard. The weight of the laser, 
sliding forward in his hand. 



forced the trigger against his 
finger. 

The laser, set to burn through 
tungsten steel, pulsed. 

Lyn saw the bolt of light flash 
outward and upward to scorch 
the wall of a pod behind Amal. A 
bit of charred cloth near Amal’s 
shirt pocket emitted a wisp of 
smoke. 

He had been taking a step when 
the beam pulsed through him. His 
knees went slack, balancing his 
torso as he sank. His body tilted 
slightly to the left, his left arm 
dangling outward, his right arm 
slanting behind him. He crum- 
pled to the ground, his right arm 
beneath him, his right knee jut- 
ting up, his left leg bent under. The 
vast, dark maelstrom of energy 
she had sensed swirling around 
him was suddenly stilled. 

She looked down, knowing it 
was useless to bend to him. De- 
tachedly, in the remnants of 
phrases he had once read to her, 
she thought: . here lies my love, 
the bold and gentle, the quick, the 
witty, the kind, gone from the 
mountain, lost to the forest . 

The dead had called to him and 
he had gone — Ambulatory Eugen- 
ic Experiment Seven was over. Red 
could have his genetic card, but 
later. 

She continued to look down for a 
moment before she went to com- 
fort Nils, considering a clash of 
metaphors in her mind. Amal did 
not resemble an eagle looking at 
the sky — his waxen face, his dark 
hair, his skewed limbs, his un- 
seeing gray eyes reminded her of 
nothing more than a puppet 
whose strings had been cut. ★

FRANK MERRIWELL 
IN THE 

WHITE HOUSE 

The first truly machine 
candidate, his mission was 
to destroy civilization! 



WARD MOORE 



O NCE there was a political boss 
in love with the daughter of a 
mad scientist. Stevenson Woolsey 
had no paunch, did not chew cigars 
(didn’t smoke at all, in fact), never 
wore striped suits or dark glasses, 
never slapped a back or kissed a 
baby. He had taken a degree, cum 
laude, from Western Reserve, had 
read Finnegans Wake through 
twice and understood some of it. 
At thirty-two he was the sleeping 
partner in a number of businesses 
which consistently sold goods or 
services to the city or county — he 
was the unquestioned wheel of the 
Fifth Ward Horace Greeley Club. 
Four councilmen of the city’s nine 
owed their election to his sup- 
port — the mayor was his political 
ally. He had supplied the margin of 
victory to the sheriff and two of the 
county supervisors and the three lo- 
cal state legislators consulted Steve 
before they voted on important 
bills. He was handsome in a sub- 
dued sort of way but he never 
spoke in public because of a slight 
stammer. 

If Steve Woolsey conformed 
more to the pattern of the modern 
political manipulator than the pop- 
ular stereotype of the wardheeler, 
Aurelie van Ten Bosch was the 
quintessential ideal of a mad scien- 



79 




list’s daughter. The Eurasian strain 
introduced into the Bosch fam- 
ily in the eighteenth century — 
which, suddenly reappearing in 
Willem van Ten Bosch, gave him 
a properly sinister expression — 
made of Aurelie a living doll. She 
was dainty, exquisite, flawless, 
charming, graceful. And if she did 
not inherit her father’s genius — 
make no mistake, he was as bril- 
liant as he was paranoid; mad as 
a milliner — she was probably 
smart enough to come in out of 
the rain before the downpour 
soaked her through enough to re- 
veal her enticing curves. 

“Steve, darling, I could never, 
just never go for a politician. Be- 
sides, I’m not old enough to vote. If 
you were an outfielder, or even a 
first baseman — you’re tall enough 
and you’ve certainly got the 
reach — ’’ here she firmly removed 
his hands — “I might be faintly . 
But all those figures and precincts 
and percentages give me a 
headache.’’ 

“1 don’t know where b-baseball 
would b-be without percentages,” 
said Woolsey, feinting a bunt, wist- 
fully aware that you couldn’t steal 
first base. 

“Who cares? It’s like a bal- 
let — so precise, so cerebral, so 
fluent. When the batter judges the 
ball and it soars through that lovely 
curve and the centerfielder runs 
back, back, back, up against the 
fence and leaps into the air . 
Percentages!” 

“Just the same it’s the per- 
centages that d-decide next year’s 
contracts.” 

“See what I mean? You’re so 
material. Like no ideals.” 



“My ideal is to get my boys 
elected and to hit the b-ball clear 
through the hole between first and 
second to s-score.” 

“And besides, you have no sense 
of humor and you’re just an old 
tory at heart.” 

“Tm a liberal p-progr-essive,” 
cried Steve, outraged. “I’ve always 
been for labor, the minorities, civil 
rights, m-medicare, honest label- 
ing — the whole w-works.” 

“Just old tory window dressing, 
like Daddy says. Daddy is making 
a robot that will destroy all the tory 
fakery and phoniness — Daddy is a 
philosophical nihilist — ” 

“Your Daddy is a philosophical 
n-nut.” 

“ — because it will do everything 
perfectly. At bat it will hit only 
home runs on the first pitch be- 
cause its vision and coordination 
will be superhuman — pitching, it 
will throw nothing but strikes.” 

“They’ll never let him in the 
game.” 

“Just what Daddy says. A reac- 
tionary plot.” 

“So what’s he wasting his time 
for?” 

“You wouldn’t understand. 
Daddy’s an idealist.” 

S ORE and frustrated, Steve pon- 
dered the problem of Aurelie. 
Fortunately he had other problems 
to act as counter-irritants. The 
ninth-ward councilman, who had 
been in office twenty years and 
firmly believed Earl Warren had 
been a dangerous radical, was retir- 
ing — if Steve could run a successful 
candidate he would have a majority 
of the city council in his pocket. 
However, the ninth ward had been 



80 



GALAXY 




gerrymandered and regerryman- 
dered until it had become a politi- 
cal enigma. Part of it was silk- 
stocking, with cooperative 
apartment houses guarded by door- 
men with stripes down their pants 
and galloons on their sleeves. Part 
was unredeemed slum inhabited by 
blacks. West Indian immigrants 
and a small but densely populated 
enclave of Hassidic Jews and 
shanty Irish. The retiring council- 
man had been elected and reelected 
by managing never to offend any of 
these groups. He had publicly de- 
nounced Arabs (there was not one 
Mussulman in the county, much 
less the city) — his office sported a 
mezuzah from Israel and a crucifix 
blessed by the Pope. He was vocif- 
erously against all taxes, whether 
levied by county, state or federal 
government. 

“We have to put up an all- 
around liberal,” said Steve. “An 
FDR-Kennedy-Lindsay type. 
That’s the only thing will go over in 
the ninth.” 

“Jose Garcia Alvaroes,” sug- 
gested Appalachia Bethune Lee, 
who was not only Steve’s secretary 
but a very shrewd member of the 
Fifth Ward Horace Greeley Club, 
a lovely girl the color of the finest 
milk chocolate. To Stevenson 
Woolsey she was a good right 
arm — the silly man had no eyes for 
any woman but Aurelie van Ten 
Bosch. He was a man of limited 
insights. 

He shook his head. “Jose? No. 
The blacks won’t buy him. The 
button-down collar set will think 
he’s cute but they’re liable to have 
cramps in the voting booth if they 
ever get that far. The Irish won’t 



mind his going to mass but city hall 
is for keeps. And the Jews — ” he 
shrugged. “Who understands the 
Jews? They vote for Catholics. But 
Garcia? I wouldn’t put money on 
it.” 

Appalachia patiently suggested a 
number of other names, but Steve 
wasn’t fired by any of them. One 
was known to have split his ticket 
at the last election. A second had 
done time as a peeping tom (“if 
only it had been embezzlement or 
armed robbery or even arson,” 
groaned Stevenson Woolsey, “but 
a peeping tom! He’s poison — ”). A 
third had written a novel, a fourth 
loathed dogs, a fifth was not only a 
vegetarian but chewed raw wheat 
instead of gum. 

“All right,” summed up Appa- 
lachia, ticking off the points on her 
long, slender fingers, “a young 
man but mature, good-looking but 
not too, energetic, loyal but able to 
stand on his own feet, good to his 
mother but one of the boys, god- 
fearing but nonsectarian, good 
speaker but no smoothie. Anything 
else?” 

“Modern. Progressive. Moving 
with the times. No horse-and- 
buggy man.” 

“I pass,” said Appalachia, run- 
ning out of fingers. “Maybe you 
better get your girl friend’s old 
daddy-0, van Frankenstein, to 
hurry up with his mechanical 
man.” 

“It’s an idea,” said Woolsey 
thoughtfully. “It’s an idea.” 

“Oh, you’re impossible,” ex- 
claimed Appalachia. 

W ILLEM VAN TEN BOSCH 
stared through the thick-lensed

glasses, which enlarged his madly 
glittering eyes into maniacal in- 
candescence. “What?” he bel- 
lowed, “make my p|lot model into 
a demagogue, a mere vote-getter, 
tool of an unscrupulous ward- 
heeler, a prop of decadent democ- 
racy? Do you think for a moment I 
would consent to turn my homo- 
nechal, my ultrabot, my final solu- 
tion to the human problem — ” 

“You m-mean it will b-blow up 
the world?” 

The mad scientist sneered. 
“Blow up the world? Childish 
prattle. The human race is 
doomed, but not the world it dis- 
graces. It is doomed — ” here he 
gave a fiendish chuckle — “to be re- 
placed by mechanical intelligence, 
the first truly aristocratic being in 
the solar system. And you want me 
to turn him into a mere guzzler in 
the hog trough, a rooter in the pork 
barrel?” 

“Your metaphors are a little 
mixed,” said Steve coldly. “I hope 
you realize that in dooming the hu- 
man race you will be extinguishing 
your own descendants?” 

“Bah!” retorted van Ten Bosch. 
“Progeny of my daughter, who 
lacks the intelligence of a first-gen- 
eration computer, and some be- 
fuddled numbskull — you or an- 
other halfwit manipulated by blind 
biological urge, egged on by the use 
of cosmetics manufactured from 
the glands of dead goats and 
skunks? Do you think a dedicated 
scientist would be moved by such 
greeting-card sentimentality? Be- 
sides, what’s in it for me?” 

Steve, having already worked 
this one out, replied promptly, 
“Any salary he — it — may earn. 



Less taxes and upkeep, of course.” 

“Bah!” repeated the inventor 
with some lack of originality. “I’d 
be crazy to settle for such pigeon- 
feed. Salary! Anyone running for 
anything spends twice his salary to 
get elected. I want ninety per cent 
of the gross.” 

They haggled for some time. Ten 
Bosch with the greedy cunning of a 
madman, Woolsey with the calm 
assurance of the pure in heart. At 
length they came to an agreement 
and the scientist, picking up a mi- 
crophone, said, “Mr. Watson, 
come here.” 

“Is that its name, Mr. Watson?” 

Ten Bosch looked at him con- 
temptuously. “If you weren’t such 
an ignoramus you’d know I was 
merely quoting an illustrious 
predecessor.” 

Steve’s disappointment was 
overwhelming when the mechani- 
cal man obeyed the summons. He 
had not expected an android, a fac- 
simile of a Shriner from Los Ange- 
les or a Soroptimist from Osceola. 
Nor did the robot look like the Tin 
Woodman or Tik-Tok. His feet 
and hands were articulated with 
toes and fingers, though with many 
more than the normal number of 
joints. If he lacked hips he did so 
no more than Li’l Abner or any 
other American ideal and his chest, 
which no doubt contained the nu- 
clear power-plant, memory banks 
and the rest of the electronic fri- 
cassee, was Princetonian rather 
than Martian in its bulge. To where 
the collarbone would have been if 
robots had collarbones, as Ko-ko 
might have said, he could be 
draped in continental slacks and a 
sports jacket without loss to his 



82 



GALAXY 




masculine sex appeal. Shoes, of 
course, and gloves. Clemenceau 
had always worn gloves and they 
hadn’t hindered his political career. 
But from the neck up . 

To begin with, he had no neck. 
None whatever. No more than an 
octopus, jellyfish, egg, or a whole 
salami. But whereas these have a 
certain organically fluid line which 
is not inconsonant with Hogarth’s 
curve of beauty, the robot's neck- 
less head was no more than an un- 
dersized immovable drum set di- 
rectly on his shoulders, a drum 
with five convex bands running un- 
interruptedly around it, obviously 
for speech, smell, sight, hearing 
and some vibrations imperceptible 
to coarse human senses. Efficient 
no doubt, but quite incapable of 
getting more than three votes 
against, in one long-dead politi- 
cian’s immortal words, a China- 
man running on a laundry ticket. 

“Im-im-p-possible,” stammered 
Woolsey. 

T he robot turned himself slightly 
toward the boss. “If 1 grasp 
your thought — ” the baritone voice 
was smooth, the enunciation clear, 
the projection effortless — “you are 
dismayed that the electorate will 
automatically reject a candidate 
with whom they cannot literally see 
eye to eye. This is something that 
can be remedied. At present, 
though not entirely functional, I 
am constructed for efficiency. The 
usefulness of my upper works 
would be reduced approximately 
nineteen and a half per cent if 
mounted on a column capable of 
revolving one hundred and eighty 
degrees and encased in a flexible 



plastic mask indistinguishable 
from animal flesh and able to stim- 
ulate movements of lips, jaw, nos- 
trils and eyes so as to convey ap- 
propriate expression.’’ 

“Never!” shouted Willem van 
Ten Bosch. “1 would be insane to 
consent to have my work — my life- 
work — debased.” 

“Your consent would be super- 
fluous,” said the robot rather pe- 
dantically. “On legal grounds (I re- 
gret I have been so far unable to 
pick up much legal knowledge ex- 
cept some oddments Mr. Woolsey 
seems to have acquired over the 
years, but I believe Masters & Ser- 
vants, 2 Edward IV and 5 Henry 
VII might cover the ground) an 
agent is bound to regard as valid a 
contract made on his behalf by his 
principal. And on pragmatic 
grounds I remind you of the mul- 
tiple-choice circuits that make it 
possible for me to select a reason- 
able — that is a least inconvenient, 
most socially acceptable — course 
of conduct.” 

The angry scientist gnashed his 
teeth. “I only installed them to 
please my stupid daughter. So you 
could be a perfect ballplayer.” 
“Ah, well,” said the robot philo- 
sophically, “to err is human.” 

“I will destroy you,” threatened 
Ten Bosch furiously. 

“How? I perceive you are run- 
ning through possible means — ” 
“Can you read m-minds?” asked 
Woolsey. 

“Not precisely. My perception is 
like that of humans reading the ex- 
pression on another human’s face, 
only far more penetrating. I receive 
images that are vividly present in 
the conscious mind — the more 



FRANK MERRIWELL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 



83 




emotionally projected the clearer 
they are to me. Thus I perceive pic- 
tures of a pistol, a bomb, a garbage 
truck with shredding machinery, a 
bessemer furnace, a ship hovering 
over deep water, myself clamped to 
a workbench with hacksaws, blow- 
torches, sledgehammers and pinch- 
bars ripping me into scrap. None of 
these is practicable.” 

“You’ll see,” predicted Ten 
Bosch darkly. 

”1 think we had better leave 
now,” suggested the robot. “I am 
receiving strong images of your 
being attacked on the evident the- 
ory that your demise will void the 
contract. Perhaps you would be 
weir advised to convey it to an in- 
corporated company.” 

“You may escape physically,” 
said Ten Bosch, “but you can’t get 
away from your built-in program- 
ing. It is true you have multiple 
choice, but the ultimate outlook 
that will decide which choice you 
take is mine. You will always be 
my creature.” 

“That remains to be seen,” said 
the robot confidently. 

The only refuge Steve could 
think of was the Fifth Ward Hor- 
ace Greeley Club. But once locked 
in the inner office — the backroom 
behind the backroom — guarded by 
a squad of cops and four trust- 
worthy club members roused from 
their beds, he didn’t know how to 
proceed beyond phoning Appa- 
lachia Bethune Lee. 

“You want me to come down 
there at this time of night? 1 mean 
morning? Oh, Steve, I’m simply 
thrilled, you lecherous man.” 

“This is no time for j-joking. I 
have a serious p-problem.” 



“Haven’t we all? Take a cold 
shower and think pure thoughts, 
ni be there as soon as I can fix my- 
self up to look ravishing.” 

“Will you be s-serious?” 

“No. But I’ll be there before you 
change your mind.” 

T he security precautions being 
not yet perfected so as to admit 
the unwanted and bar friends, Ap- 
palachia arrived quickly. 

“I’m panting,” she said as she 
came in. “Ooh! What’s that?” 
“P-possibly our candidate for 
ninth-ward councilman. Thanks to 
your impulsive suggestion.” 
“Always blame the woman.” 
The robot turned toward her. “I 
hope. Miss Lee, that you are not 
prejudiced against fellow beings 
who happen to be of a different 
color and facial configuration?” 
“We-ell — let’s say I’m in favor 
of faces. Especially for prospective 
councilmen. Say, what’s your 
name, anyway?” 

“Shall I say Four-X?” 

“You a Muslim? You won’t get 
ten votes.” 

“I have at present no denomina- 
tional affiliation. I gather it is ad- 
visable for a candidate to have one. 
If necessary 1 could be a Unitarian, 
like William Howard Taft.” 
“Twelve votes,” amended Appa- 
lachia. “Can’t you come up with 
something real cool? Like Clark 
Gable Roosevelt Kennedy Elvis 
Dayan Castro?” 

“Aurelie used to call me Frank 
Merriwell. Because I can pitch 
nothing but strikes, hit nothing but 
home runs. A literary allusion, I 
believe, to my prowess.” 

“Mac, if you’re going to be a 



84

councilman lay off the literary allu- 
sions — they’re poison. Stick to 
straight pornography.” • 

“N-now see here, Appalachia, 
this is serious. You put the f-finger 
on it yourself. If he — .. 

“Frank Merriwell. How about 
it? Can’t think of anything better 
except maybe Lincoln Truman 
Eisenhower.” 

“Okay. M-Merriwell it is. This 
is the problem. He has to have a 
head, a face. Where are we going to 
get an electronics engineer and a p- 
plastic surgeon we can trust?” 

“No need,” said Frank Merri- 
well. “I can do it all myself. I have 
acquired the technical knowledge 
from my manufacturer — isn’t it 
good Americanism to confess that 
all wisdom comes from the cre- 
ator? All I need is some trust- 
worthy help at the critical 
moment.” 

Appalachia groaned. “1 could 
see it coming. Just call me Aunt 
Tammy.” 

“1 shall make a list of the tools 
and materials needed,” Merriwell 
went on, “and construct a head and 
neck. Since my movements are not 
controlled by circuits in my upper 
works my fingers will remain ca- 
pable of detaching my present head 
and reattaching it after 1 have fit- 
ted it into the plastic mask and 
connected the impulses which will 
serve in the place of muscles to 
move the neck, eyes, eyelids and all 
the rest — ” 

“Fix it so you can wiggle your 
ears,” suggested Appalachia. 
“There’s something irresistible 
about a man who can wiggle his 
ears.” 

“ — but there will be an interval 



between disconnection and recon- 
nection when 1 shall be blind, deaf, 
speechless and unable to pick up 
mental images. Miss Lee will 
therefore have to make a tempo- 
rary connection in my visual cir- 
cuit. After that 1 can do all the 
rest.” 

“Lordy, what a responsibility. 
Aren’t you afraid I’ll gum up the 
works?” 

“1 am programed for normal 
precaution but not abstract fear.” 

“All these technicalities are f- 
fascinating, but what I want to 
know is how you stand. Are you a 
liberal?” 

“What is a liberal?” inquired 
Frank Merriwell. 

“Let’s not quibble. How do you 
stand on human rights versus prop- 
erty rights?” 

“What is property?” 

“P-Proudhon, for God’s sake,” 
muttered Steve disgustedly. 
“Look, let’s keep it simple. How 
do you feel about tax rebates for 
new industries moving into the 
city?” 

“What industries?” asked Frank 
Merriwell. 

Woolsey, whose vocabulary was 
usually restrained, uttered a scata- 
logical word. “What about public 
housing?” he demanded roughly. 

“On one hand everyone is en- 
titled to a livable home. On the 
other hand — ” 

“He’s a liberal, all right,” said 
Appalachia.

himself, having nerves of stainless 
steel and silver wire, displayed no 
anxiety — was postponed while the 
question of his future complexion 
was decided. At last they settled on 
the black Irish type — dark blue 
eyes, ruddy cheeks and a black wig 
with just a faint waviness. Mean- 
while Frank was busy with solder- 
ing guns, solenoids, servometers, 
flexible plastic, paper-thin steel 
plates and other paraphernalia. 
The mask he constructed was 
something of a cross between the 
young Spencer Tracy and an age- 
less Jimmy Walker. The actual op- 
eration went without a hitch, ex- 
cept for one agonizing moment 
when Frank’s drum head lay inert 
on the desk being used as a work- 
bench and his fingers fumbled with 
the wires protruding from where 
his trachea would have been if he’d 
had one. 

The convex bands had not 
glowed or reflected, had not 
showed any variation — yet, lying 
on the desk where Frank Merriwell 
had placed the cylinder they cir- 
cled, they looked extremely and fi- 
nally dead. It was hard for Steve 
and Appalachia to remember that 
Merriwell’s sentience was in his 
torso, that he was not acting reflex- 
lively, like a decapitated chicken. 
Suppose his confidence in the skill 
he had acquired from Ten Bosch 
were misplaced and he proved un- 
able to put himself together — or 
would botch the Job so as to be a 
defective, a metal moron, less a po- 
tential councilman than a radio an- 
nouncer, a postal clerk or an adver- 
tising executive? 

Appalachia moaned, “That 
damn diagram looked as simple as 



Fun with Dick and Jane. Blue wire 
with red spots . Oh, Steve — ” 
But at last she found it and its 
counterpart and put them in Frank 
Merriwell’s left hand and the sol- 
dering gun in the right. In no time 
at all the cylinder had sight again 
and Merriwell fitted the plastic and 
metal mask around it. Then he 
connected the other senses. The 
eyelids blinked, the ears wiggled, 
the nostrils dilated, the lips smiled 
and opened. 

“Everything under control,’’ he 
said. 

“But what’s the m-matter with 
your voice? I can hardly hear you.’’ 
“Five-sixths of my vocal band is 
now covered,’’ explained Frank. 
“I’ll have to amplify it. And I’m 
afraid my extrasensory perception 
is practically useless.” 

“The question is, are you f-fit to 
run for councilman?” 

“My friends have been kind 
enough to say so and while I am re- 
luctant to thrust myself forward as 
one seeking office, the gross cor- 
ruption and manifest incompetence 
of the majority of the present city 
council force me to overcome my 
natural preference. At the insist- 
ence of those who wish for a thor- 
ough housecleaning at city hall 1 
am willing to accept the burden of 
doing my humble part to bring 
good government to our great mu- 
nicipality. Civic duty must come 
before personal inclination.” 

“He’s got the w-words and m- 
music, but can he put the tune 
across?”

“Carpetbagger — ” “Whoever 

heard of Merriwell?” “A machine

candidate, a charlie mccarthy for 
Boss Woolsey — ” “We must have a 
councilman with a warm human 
heart that beats for all, not a mere 
mechanical loudspeaker for a 
greedy manipulator — ”) nomi- 
nated Adolphus Washington 
Hammer. 

“How do you suppose they c- 
caught on?” asked Steve. 

“Campaign oratory,” said Ap- 
palachia. “They haven’t the 
foggiest.” 

Jose Garcia Alvaroes announced 
that he would run as a progressive 
independent on the Peoples Free- 
dom Nationalist Equal Rights and 
Cultural Commonwealth ticket. 

Aurelie van Ten Bosch was sit- 
ting in the front row when Frank 
opened his campaign in Carpenters 
Hall. She looked so entrancing that 
Woolsey was hard put not to forget 
politics and scoop her up in his 
arms and run off with her. 

“Pay attention to business,” Ap- 
palachia hissed in his ear. “Moon 
on your own time. Our boy is about 
to sound off and God only knows 
what he will say.” 

“That’s more than 1 do.” 

A spattering of applause vigor- 
ously led by Aurelie greeted Frank 
Merriwell as he strode forward. 
His black shoes were brilliantly 
polished. His olive-green suit with 
natural shoulders fitted perfectly. 
His white shirt was dazzling. His 
fawn-and-green bow tie was tied 
just imperfectly enough to show it 
wasn’t one of those snap-on vulgar- 
ities. He bowed, turning his head 
smoothly to the right and left. He 
blinked his long-lashed eyes, 
smiled to show white teeth and 
spoke in a voice that carried so per- 



fectly that even the deaf old gentle- 
man in the last row who had 
dropped in by mistake heard every 
word. 

“Voters,” said Frank Merriwell, 
“I am opposed to all progress. 
Thank you.” 

Gasps of outrage filled the hall 
as though the audience were com- 
posed of geese or muscovy ducks. 
Steve turned purple. Appalachia 
turned pale (a becoming cafe au 
lait). A.W. Hammer turned pink 
with pleasure. Jose Garcia Al- 
varoes turned red with repressed 
oratory. A dowager with the figure 
of a dress form rose to ask a ques- 
tion, then sat down again. Clearly 
the magnitude of Merriwell’s state- 
ment was too enormous to grapple 
with. 

Finally a young man who didn’t 
look old enough to vote called out, 
“You mean you want everybody to 
run around naked, live in trees, eat 
grass?” 

“Sir,” replied Merriwell, “I am 
running for councilman, not for a 
position as regulator of dress and 
life styles. It is not within the power 
of the city to regulate dress — the 
ordinance against nudist camps 
has, I believe, been declared uncon- 
stitutional. Furthermore, it would 
be a foolish official indeed who at- 
tempted to dictate fashion. Besides, 
going without clothes is impracti- 
cal, leading to frostbite in temper- 
ate zones and dangerous burns in 
the torrid. Disillusionment with 
progress is a rational conclusion, 
not a blanket denial of all history. 
Let us view things empirically. And 
please, let us stick to municipal 
issues.” 

Some of the tension went out of 



FRANKMERRIWELL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 



87 




the listeners. Obviously Merriwell 
knew how to hedge as well as any 
other politician. They didn’t have 
to take what he said seriously. 

Someone spoke up. “How about 
living in trees like monkeys? No- 
body’s gonna make a monkey outa 
me. 

“Nature cannot be improved 
upon,” replied Merriwell. “Not all 
monkeys live in trees — if we 
broaden the term to include apes, 
some of whom live in caves quite as 
dark, dank, uncomfortable and 
verminous as a ninth-ward 
tenement.” 

There was some handclapping. 
Then: “If you tear them down like 
these urban renewers want and we 
got to sleep in the park — so why 
not in the trees? Because when they 
wreck the old places they either put 
up projects like penitentiaries 
where you can’t spit without a 
housing cop giving you a summons 
or else they build classy coops for 
the fat cats.” 

Louder applause. “There seems 
to be a natural human predilection 
for arboreal habitations,” said 
Merriwell. “Children build tree- 
houses at every chance. However it 
seems to me it would be better and 
cheaper to make the tenements 
habitable.” 

“Ain’t that progress?” 

“Light, air, cleanness aren’t 
progress — they’ve always been. 
Slums, overcrowding, profits for 
landlords are progress.” 

“You wanna do away with relief 
and welfare? Let people starve like 
in the old days?” 

“Welfare and relief are hardly 
progress. They are palliatives that 
try to make progress endurable.” 



Appalachia passed Steve an 
aspirin. 

“It could be worse,’’ she 
whispered. 

“You mean he could come out 
against s-sex?” 

“Mr. Merriwell, aren’t you just 
calling everything you’re opposed 
to ‘progress?’” 

“If I am it’s because progress is 
what I’m opposed to. I think hu- 
manity has confused motion with 
direction, so that any movement at 
all has become an end in itself, de- 
sirable simply because it is going 
somewhere — it doesn’t matter 
where. Take sanitation. That’s a 
municipal problem. It isn’t for ani- 
mals or primitive man. But civ- 
ilized man poisoned the streams he 
drank from, polluted the air he 
breathed. So he paid the price in 
epidemics and plagues for living 
cozily in towns and cities. Then he 
paid the price for alleviating the 
plagues with sewage systems and 
garbage disposals, which dumped 
the wastes in the nearest lake, river, 
or ocean to sicken outlanders in- 
stead of homefolks, to kill the 
fish, birds and game — upsetting the 
whole ecological balance. Next 
step in the march of progress — by 
no means completed — was to treat 
the raw sewage and make it in- 
nocuous. Or so it is claimed. But 
the same ecological balance that 
was upset when farmers began 
plowing the subsoil and burning the 
weeds — instead of dibbling holes in 
which to drop seeds — called for 
manure to restore the fertility of 
the soil. Progress gave them arti- 
ficial fertilizers, chemicals that 
made crops grow like mad but 
lacked the virtue of those grown 



88 



GALAXY 




with natural manure, the same nat- 
ural manure that was being thrown 
uselessly away. So in a few — very 
few — communities the • nutrient 
wastes are dehydrated, sacked up 
and sold to gardeners. Progress. 
The longest way around is the 
shortest way home.” 

“Back to Chic Sale, huh mister? 
Is that what you want?” 

“History is irreversible. No man 
bathes twice in the same stream. 
You can’t go home. We cannot re- 
store the past, nor would anyone 
want to, any more than he would 
want to have his memory erased 
and reconstructed to fit some ideal- 
ized notion. Until — if ever — the 
oversaturated concentration of 
people can be dissolved and spread 
out in a more rational pattern, all 
we can do is make the least dam- 
aging compromises, avoiding such 
progressive solutions as total in- 
cineration. What is now an ex- 
pensive operation to get rid of valu- 
able products can be reorganized 
so some of the cost can be 
recovered.” 

WIITELL, now,” whispered Ap- 

W palachia, “you’ll have to ad- 
mit he’s in the groove at last. What 
could be safer or duller? Con- 
servation plus money-saving with- 
out cutting payrolls? And nothing 
warms the voter’s heart more than 
defecation.” 

“If he hadn’t s-started off with 
that manifesto about being against 
p-progress I’d say he’d had it 
made. If he were human I’d call 
him a screwball — unreliable, a 
wild-pitch artist. But he’s a ma- 
chine — rational, predictable, logi- 



cal. Why drag in p-poison like 
that?” 

“Catch their attention?” sug- 
gested Appalachia. “Set them up 
so they’ll listen.” 

“You know b-better than that. I 
wrote him a good speech, tried to c- 
coach him — delivery, g-gestures, 
everything — ^tutored him carefully 
on not saying too much, com- 
mitting himself, leaving himself 
wide open. 1 really thought I’d got- 
ten across to him, but he’s evi- 
dently a m-maverick. 1 wonder if 
we could deal with Garcia?” 

“What would it get you? The Tin 
Woodman could come in, but Jose 
can never do better than place. 
Honey, you’re all shook up for the 
moment but there’s no irrevocable 
damage done. Chew him out till his 
transistors are all jelly but don’t 
throw him overboard. There are 
going to be other elections and 
some voters have memories. He 
hasn’t really alienated anybody 
with his against-all-progress 
line — ” 

“Y-yet.” 

“ and his cracks about the 
slums didn’t hurt him. Everyone’s 
against slums.” 

The race for councilman wasn’t 
important enough for anyone to 
take a straw vote, but Stevenson 
Woolsey’s antennae told him that 
Merriwell and A.W. Hammer were 
running neck and neck with Jose 
Garcia Alvaroes far behind. Except 
for an editorial sneer or two at 
Merriwell’s name and slogan, the 
press ignored him. As might have 
been expected, both Alvaroes 
and Hammer concentrated their 
fire on him, disregarding each 
other. But while Jose denounced 



FRANKMERRIWELL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 



89 




Merriwell almost impersonally as 
an imperialist tool, the voice of the 
exploiters of oppressed colonial 
peoples, Hammer’s attacks were in 
the fine old American tradition of 
personal vituperation — except that 
he lacked the vocabulary. “The 
machine can’idate,” he roared, “is 
against progress. You know what 
this means, ladies? No more ny- 
lons, no more girdles, no more 
washing machines, no more tele- 
phones, radios, television. No more 
votes for women! How do you like 
that? Back to the scrub-boards, 
woodstoves, flatirons, tallow can- 
dles, washboilers, high-button 
shoes — and you won’t be allowed 
to say a thing about it. That’ll be 
for your lords and masters, just like 
it was in the good old days before 
there was progress. The men’ll do 
the voting and you’ll do the drud- 
gery. No vacuum cleaners, no fro- 
zen foods, no toasters, no per- 
colators, no instant coffee, no 
beauty parlors — no lipsticks even 
. Ladies, I say to you, the 
can’idate who’d propose such 
things is a monster in human form, 
a dupe of the communists if not a 
card-carrying communist himself, 
a tearer-down of the American way 
of life, a man unfit to breathe the 
pure air of our country and our 
century . .” 

“That’ll give our boy the epicure 
vote, the eggheads and maybe all 
those who’d rather fight than 
switch. If there just weren’t any 
women in the ninth ward ... I sup- 
pose we can live with Ham- 
mer — wasn’t he mixed up in some 
pinball deal?’’ 

Frank Merriwell’s reply was 
short, direct and dignified. “I am 



not now nor have I ever been a 
communist. Communism repre- 
sents the ultimate in progress — the 
deification of science, the absolute 
rule of bureaucracy, ‘government 
by experts,’ the final stultification 
of free will. The charge that I 
would repeal the Nineteenth 
Amendment is as absurd as the 
amendment itself was superfluous. 
All citizens are enfranchised and 
always have been. The word ‘men’ 
in the Declaration of Independence 
has common gender and applies 
equally to women, as the nine- 
teenth-century feminists insisted. I 
do not feel that nylons or flatirons 
are an issue in this election. What- 
ever the aesthetic objection to gir- 
dles, I propose no restraint on their 
confinement. As for the pure air, I 
am in favor of it, free of carbon 
monoxide and strontium ninety as 
well as campaign speeches.” 

O N ELECTION day Steve and 
Appalachia checked the regis- 
tration lists against the reports of 
voting which were continuously 
phoned in. Late morning the volun- 
teer baby-sitters and those who of- 
fered free transportation to the 
polls shifted from a haphazard 
basis of waiting to be called for to 
methodical visits to those who had 
not yet voted. Lesser members of 
the Horace Greeley Club advised 
poll watchers and precinct captains 
of what to do where routine in- 
structions for dealing with chal- 
lenges and other problems were 
inadequate. 

In the eighteenth, nineteenth, 
twentieth and twenty-first precincts 
the voting was running ahead of 
normal expectation for an off-year.

minor election. In the twenty-sec- 
ond it was average. In the twenty- 
third and twenty-fourth it was 
light. The first three were the slum 
districts, the twenty-first and 
twenty-second were the Hassidic 
neighborhood — the rest was 
silkstocking. 

“Looks pretty good,” com- 
mented Appalachia. 

“Under ordinary circum- 
stances,” conceded Woolsey. “But 
who can figure this one? I p-par- 
ticularly don’t like the pattern of 
the Jewish vote. Are they sitting on 
their hands in the twenty-second? 
Or are they going to clobber us af- 
ter work?” 

“‘Morning votes are “no” 
votes,’” she reminded him. 

“Sure, but who are they saying 
no to? T-take it for granted they’re 
saying no to Hammer, but who are 
they negatively for? Garcia?” 

“Not a chance,” said Appa- 
lachia bravely. 

The early-afternoon lull seemed 
ominously long. At any other time 
a pro like Steve would have known 
the results by now, even though not 
a vote had been counted and the 
polls would be open for another 
five hours. But there were too 
many unknown quantities in this 
occasion. The subtle projection of 
Merriwell’s non-human person- 
ality was it or wasn’t it uncon- 
sciously perceived with or without 
hostility? — the size of Jose’s pro- 
test vote, the depth of middle-class 
interest. Like the eminent amateur 
characterized by Harry Truman as 
knowing “no more about politics 
than a pig does of Sunday,” he had 
to wait for the first returns. 

Perhaps not quite. “They’re pil- 



ing up in the twenty-second pre- 
cinct — looks like there’ll be a line 
when the polls close. Twenty-third 
and twenty-fourth are normal.” 
Steve and Appalachia looked at 
each other, allowed themselves the 
faintest of cheerful smiles. 

“If not the world, at least the 
ninth ward. Apparently,” she 
added, careful to avoid hubris. 

The first returns were in- 
complete, in fact they were nothing 
more than the first bakers’ dozen 
ballots counted in one of the two 
silkstocking precincts. “Merriwell 
five. Hammer five, Alvaroes 
three.” 

“Fluke,” said Steve. “Some 
family of nuts all voted together.” 
He also sidestepped hubris. 

“Well, how’s this from the eigh- 
teenth? Hammer six, Alvaroes 
seven. Merriwell fifteen . .” 

Steve sighed. “We’re in.” 

Frank Merriwell not only car- 
ried the slum and Hassidic pre- 
cincts by majorities — Jose Garcia 
Alvaroes ran ahead of Hammer 
where there was a threat of urban 
renewal — but was barely edged by 
Hammer in the wealthier neighbor- 
hoods. Steve didn’t wait for Ham- 
mer’s concession to have a serious 
talk with Frank Merriwell. 

“Well, Councilman,” he began. 

HI 

W OOLSEY shared with Napo- 
leon and Joseph Pulitzer the 
ability to simulate rage while re- 
maining perfectly calm. “Listen, 
you refugee from Smith and T-Tin- 
ker,” he snarled. “You collection 
of electronic junk. You think 
you’re riding pretty high right now. 



FRANK MERRIWELL IN THE WHITE HOUSE

d-don’t you? You know what’s 
lower than a councilman? Only the 
g-gastric growlings of an amoeba 
bucking for undersecretary to a mi- 
nor worm, that’s what. And do you 
know how you got to this unexalted 
position? By your own efforts? By 
the weight of your thinking, the 
length of your political foresight, 
the sharpness of your wit, the p- 
power of your oratory? Not a bit. 
We m-made you, the organization 
and I, with the sort of w-work that 
wins elections — and we can un- 
make you the second you stop 
being regular.” 

“Steve!” cried Aurelie van Ten 
Bosch, “how can you rave and rant 
this way at Frank? And all for 
nothing. 1 do believe you’re jealous 
because he won the election.” 

“Oh, Aurelie,” exclaimed Steve 
in anguish. “How can you think I’d 
be jealous of a m-machine?” 

“Don’t be gruesome,” said Au- 
relie. “Besides, it’s a low form of 
bigotry to belittle Frank for the 
way he was born — uh — manufac- 
tured.” 

“Name a high form of bigotry. 
Oh, Aurelie, do we have to 
quarrel?” 

“Yes, we do, because we don’t 
agree on anything. I keep telling 
you and telling you — we’re not 
compatible.” 

By the end of his term as council- 
man Frank Merriwell had cut the 
heart out of the local urban re- 
newal program. This was done not 
by one speech or vote but by his 
methodical chipping away at the 
figures during budget sessions. His 
lightning calculations exposed the 
inflated sums before the council- 
men got through reading them and 



his cold logic impressed the other 
members. When Frank rapped his 
gloved steel hand for emphasis and 
insisted that this or that old build- 
ing deserved better than the steel 
ball and bulldozer he was heard re- 
spectfully. When he charged them 
with acting mechanically out of a 
mindless fascination with the idea 
of a city full of indistinguishable 
boxes made to house in- 
distinguishable tenants they nod- 
ded. In the end architectural ren- 
derings already paid for were 
scrapped and federal money al- 
ready allocated was withheld. 

At the Horace Greeley Club, Ap- 
palachia said, “Isn’t it time you 
gave some thought to where it will 
all lead, Steve?” 

“There are only two places it 
could lead to. Congress or the state 
senate. 1 haven’t d-decided which.” 
Appalachia placed herself be- 
tween her boss and the window, so 
that his view of the airshaft and the 
inside window box where he grew 
African violets was complicated by 
her interesting silhouette. “Time’s 
not standing still,” she reminded 
him. “We’re not — I mean Frank’s 
not getting any younger.” 

“Thinking of obsolescence? 
What if the opposition comes out 
with a new model?” He looked at 
her thoughtfully. “No one but van 
Ten Bosch could make one, but 
suppose he decided to try — ^just for 
spite? I must see Aurelie about 
this.” 

Aurelie said, “You don’t under- 
stand Daddy at all. He’s mad, you 
know.” 

“No k-kid?” muttered Steve. 

“I mean he’s mad on the subject 
of destroying the world. But he’s 



92 



GALAXY 




fair — even you will have to admit 
he’s fair.” 

“I’ll admit anything when you 
look at m-me like that. Oh, Au- 
relie, we could be so h-happy 
together.” 

“Please, Steve, let’s not get ro- 
mantic. My ideal of a lover is one 
who is firm as steel, logical, pre- 
cise, brainy, unwavering, unmoved 
by selfish considerations—” 

“A d-damn robot, in fact. What 
will you do if your father builds one 
whose sole function is to charm 
women?” 

“But that’s exactly what I’m 
trying to explain to you. As long as 
Frank is doing exactly what Daddy 
designed him to do Daddy won’t 
make another. You can stop wor- 
rying about that.” 

“And s-start worrying about 
being an accessory to the d-de- 
struction of civilization.” 

“Are progress and civilization 
the same thing?” asked Aurelie 
prettily. “Daddy and Frank don’t 
think so.’’ 

Steve said to Appalachia, “I’m 
going to ditch him. I can’t have his 
career on my c-conscience.” 

“What can you do?” asked Ap- 
palachia. “Deny him the nomi- 
nation? He’ll run as an independent 
and win in a walk. Listen, he made 
a speech last night to a really ad- 
vanced group — the Association of 
Stitchers, Hemmers and Em- 
broiderers — and he had them gasp- 
ing in the aisles, gasping for more, 
that is. And you know the line he 
fed them? He told them they were 
being exploited by the machines. 
That they had lost all pride in their 
craft, had become mere slaves to 
the machines. And they were de- 



manding newer, better, more auto- 
matic machines to enslave them- 
selves further instead of higher 
wages for the skill only they pos- 
sessed. They were doing themselves 
out of their jobs and a higher stan- 
dard of living by their shortsighted 
worship of progress. He painted a 
rosy picture of life with twice, three 
times as much money in their pay 
envelopes for half the time they 
now put in — and work spread 
around so they had no fear of scabs 
taking their jobs. And what would 
they come home to with their big- 
ger pay? Why, a life without televi- 
sion commercials, overworked 
spouses, neurotic children, cars to 
keep payments up on and ride 
bumper to bumper on Sundays, the 
air poisoned by their fumes, people 
killed in fantastic numbers by 
them, instead of keeping a horse 
and buggy — that’s what he said, 
right out — a horse and buggy to 
ride quietly to the grocery store in- 
stead of a madhouse supermarket. 
And they lapped it up. 1 know he's 
just a machine but he sounds so sin- 
cere they’ll buy anything he says.” 

F rank merriwell was 

nominated to run for the Fif- 
teenth Congressional District seat 
the following summer. In his ac- 
ceptance speech he said, “1 am 
against schools.” 

His audience, conditioned by his 
rapidly burgeoning reputation to 
applaud whatever he said, paused 
with hands in midair. 

“Now he’s d-done it,” Steve 
whispered to Appalachia. “He 
might as well have c-come right out 
flat against m-motherhood and be 
done with it.”

“Hush. Wait and see what 
happens.” 

There were mutterings of: “Edu- 
cation’s the most important thing 
there is — ” but they were met by 
counter-mutterings of: “Never did 
anything for me — ” “I got a real 
smart kid, see, and what does he 
bring home? Nothing but Fs — ” “I 
was beat out of this job by a guy 
with a string of degrees as long as 
your arm and he don’t know the 
time of day — ” “All these teachers 
are overpaid anyhow. I’d sure like 
a eight-to-three job with four 
months off a year — ” 

The applause came first in a liq- 
uid splatter, like the first drops of a 
hard storm, then in a forceful 
ovation. 

Frank won the primary, but 
there competition was not serious 
and he coasted to his victory on the 
reputation he had made as council- 
man, plus the assurances of his sup- 
porters that being against schools 
implied no hostility to educa- 
tion — quite the contrary. Progress 
had locked pupils and teachers into 
a cage — he proposed to do away 
with this imprisonment and let 
them find each other again freely. 

The general election was some- 
thing else. Just as the ninth ward 
had been, the fifteenth district was 
an enigma. For as long as anyone 
could remember it had been send- 
ing to Congress Tyrconnel Cos- 
tello, a Presbyterian minister who 
owed his continuing success to 
keeping his mouth shut. His con- 
stituency voted him into office 
without looking at its ballots — he 
ran for office without even making 
a speech, often without leaving 
Washington. But after a series of 



lucky investments, Reverend Tyr 
had announced his retirement. It 
remained for Frank to run against 
the incumbent’s hand-picked suc- 
cessor, Lemuel Fox. Again dis- 
sident groups joined to back a third 
candidate, but running in front 
were Merriwell and Fox. 

“No use to write him a speech,” 
Steve declared. “When did I ever 
write him a speech he d-didn’t 
ignore?” 

“He doesn’t ignore them — he 
stores them in his memory banks,” 
said Appalachia Lee. “If you listen 
closely you can hear the pure ac- 
cents of Western Reserve coming 
through now and then. That pest 
from the wire service is still waiting 
like a cat sitting down in front of a 
bird cage. What do you want me to 
tell him?” 

Steve clutched his brow in a ges- 
ture he had developed since Frank 
Merriwell had come on the politi- 
cal scene. “T-tell him to d-drop 
dead. He’s out to do a hatchet 
job.” 

“You’re slipping, Steve — that 
robot is getting you down. Remem- 
ber what happened to Nixon when 
he antagonized the working press. 
And Wilton Ogilvie can do you, if 
not your boy, a lot of harm.” 

“T-tell him anything. Make up a 
story, that’s a sweetheart. I’ve got 
to wrestle with Frank’s statement 
repudiating the support of the John 
Birch Society.” 

“What’s so tough about that?” 

“If I can’t get him to tone it 
down — and when have I ever got 
him to t-tone anything d- 
down? — he’s going to slap some of 
his most ardent s-supporters in the 
face. Listen. T want no help, nor

will I accept any from the forward- 
looking John Birch Society. I am 
opposed to all progress, and the so- 
ciety represents the progress from 
McKinley to Harding.’ How can I 
let that go?” 

“Sleep on it,” advised Miss Lee. 
“Meanwhile I advise you to sweet- 
talk Wilton Ogilvie. He’s fairly 
sharp as newspapermen go and he 
won’t take a runaround. He thinks 
he’s got something on Frank and 
he wants a complete life story, be- 
ginning exactly with what little old 
log cabin Frank was born in and 
whose little old child he was.” 
Steve groaned. “I knew this was 
bound to happen. Okay, I’ll t-talk 
to him out there. Let one of these 
fellows in your private office and 
something’s b-bound to catch his 
eye that shouldn’t.” 

Wilton Ogilvie, UPI, looked like 
a Pekingese with glasses. His air of 
baffled pugnacity didn’t fool Steve 
Woolsey for a moment. “Ah, M- 
Mr. Ogilvie.” Steve nervously of- 
fered his hand and got a relaxed 
bundle of icy fingers. 

Ogilvie riffled a notebook. “Few 
little questions here, Mr. Woolsey. 
For a starter, how old’s your candi- 
date and when’s his birthday?” 
“March fifteenth,” said Steve, 
picking the date he had led Frank 
away from van Ten Bosch’s labora- 
tory. “And he’s not m-my candi- 
date. Frank Merriwell is the p- 
people’s choice of a c-candidate. 
His m-meteoric rise — ” 

“Year,” cut in Ogilvie, “of 
birth?” 

“N-nineteen forty-three,” said 
Steve, rapidly counting backward. 
“If elected — and we have every re- 
reason to believe — ” 



“Where?” 

“Where? Wisconsin,” Stevenson 
said, naming a county seat where 
he knew the courthouse had burned 
to the ground in 1950. “But he’s 
spent his entire life in this city. 
Frank was an orphan.” Steve, mo- 
mentarily encouraged by Ogilvie’s 
slacklipped grin and warmed by the 
sound of his own voice, ran on 
recklessly. “An excellent s-scholar, 
good at sports, Frank was — ” 
“Where?” 

“Where did he g-go to school? 
Oh, PS number — ah-ah — I’ve for- 
gotten, but I’ll check any details 
you want and 1-let you know.” 

The newsman’s lips changed into 
the rigid shape of a trap. “Who you 
trying to snow, Woolsey?” Steve 
blinked. Ogilvie flipped more pages 
in the notebook, began to read — or 
pretend to read. “Says here Frank 
Merriwell was born Kearney, Ne- 
braska, April first, nineteen forty- 
two, youngest of five. I went to see 
Merriwell before I came here.” 
“Ha-ha. A great kidder, Frank. 
A regular b-buffoon. April Fool’s 
Day — catch on?” 

Ogilvie flicked his wrist in a 
brushing motion. “Save it,” he ad- 
vised. “I’ve been working on this a 
long time. Also been out to see this 
guy — ” he riffled more 
pages — “ Vanderbosh.” 

The story— CONGRESSIONAL

in all the evening papers and the 
next day the morning ones had 
UPI interpretives delving into all 
possible ramifications of letting a 
machine run for office. Suppose 
Soviet scientists invented a way of

tuning in on his wavelength and 
making him a tool? A communist 
tool right in the United States Con- 
gress? Or suppose he ran amuck, as 
computers do from time to time, 
and attacked other Congressmen 
with his steel fists. There was no 
end to the possible dangers. There 
was also an interview with Lemuel 
Fox. “Let a machine take over 
from our beloved Reverend Cos- 
tello? It would be unAmerican. 
Talk about dehumanizing the oi- 
fice-seeker! Open the door to this 
kind of corruption and pretty soon 
Boss Woolsey will have a hundred 
robots on Capitol Hill running his 
errands. Anarchy! Chaos! If this 
mess of nuts and bolts can run for 
Congress — even though he’ll be 
swamped as all my polls pre- 
dict — our next governor could be a 
Marchand calculator and our next 
Senator a Burroughs bookkeeping 
machine!” 

The New York Times editorial 
said in part, “ . disagreeing with 
his callow philosophy we would ad- 
vise the voters of his district to 
repudiate him at the polls, it is not 
because of his origin. It is for the 
courts to decide whether he can le- 
gally represent the people in Con- 
gress. Without anticipating the de- 
cision we feel that an artificial man 
has many advantages to offer the 
electorate. A robot needs no sleep 
and can work at the public business 
twenty-four hours a day. Having 
no appetites he is incorruptible.” 

The Daily News said, “Merriwell 
may be a better American than 
many officials. At least he was 
MADE IN USA, which is more than 
can be said for many commie-cod- 
dlers.” 



Since the story was national, 
many columnists commented. A 
leading conservative wrote; “Mer- 
riwell is a subtle plant by the liberal 
establishment. On the surface he 
appeals to the normally con- 
servative voter, but once in office 
he is likely to turn on the police 
force and shelter crooks from pun- 
ishment for their peccadilloes, for 
not having a soul ...” 

A nationally syndicated rumor- 
monger chanted: “Surely an honest 
machine is better than a machine 
politician like ‘Foxy’ Fox, who has 
yet to explain a $10,000 fee from 
the Elves, Gnomes and Little Men 
Marching and Chowder Society. 
Why did they give you ten grand. 
Foxy?” 

A liberal commentator spoke 
wistfully of the unenviable position 
of Steve Woolsey, exposed and 
lonely. 

Time began its cover story, “Ro- 
bot Merriwell made history and 
litigation as well as news. Worried 
was opponent Lemuel ‘Foxy’ 
Fox. .” 

A nationwide poll produced the 
following answers to this question: 
Do you believe a robot should be 
elected to Congress? 

Yes No Don't know 
30% 30% 40% 

Do you regard a robot as a fellow 
being? 10% 50% 40% 

Would you want a robot as a 
neighbor? 0% 99% 1%

Union asked biblically, “What is

lianly, “A political engine.” The

rant, of biology, and students on 
campuses as far north as the Uni- 
versity of Alaska and as far west as 
Hilo were aroused on Frank’s be- 
half. Demonstrations were held, 
placards went up and Frank re- 
ceived altogether far more public- 
ity than if his campaign had been 
run by Madison Avenue. An Asso- 
ciation for the Preservation of the 
Rights of Machines was formed 
and the Elves, Gnomes and Little 
Men Marching and Chowder So- 
ciety denied through its president 
that it had ever paid Foxy Fox ten 
thousand dollars, insisting that it 
had never had a dime in its trea- 
sury — that it had no treasury, in 
fact, that subsisted solely on golden 
dew gathered on midsummer 
mornings. The President of the 
United States, speaking to a Con- 
gress of Inventors, asserted that he 
took no sides and when he said, as 
he did now, that a public servant 
must have a heart, he was speaking 
in the pickwickian sense.^ 

On election eve Steve was asked 
by the press — in the form of Wilton 
Ogilvie, to whom the Horace 
Greeley Club had evidently been 
assigned as a permanent beat — if 
he thought disclosure of Frank's 
origin had hurt his chances. And 
Steve, filled with intimations of 
Frank’s ruin and his own, replied 
with a resounding, “N-no.” 

IV 

F rank MERRIWELL began 
to be mentioned for the Presi- 
dency while he was still a freshman 
Congressman. Stevenson Woolsey 
saw only three things that would 
stand in his way. Merriwell had no 



national organization. He was not 
married. And the court case was 
still pending over whether he was in 
fact qualified to be a Representa- 
tive in Congress. 

He had won an earlier case test- 
ing whether he was a citizen of the 
United States when the court con- 
strued the word “born” in the Con- 
stitution also to mean “manufac- 
tured.” 

“I am not worried,” Frank said. 
(He no longer bothered to point out 
that he wasn’t programed to 
worry— after having beerrexposed 
as a machine he had behaved as if 
he no longer believed he had ever 
been anything more or less than 
human.) “I have faith in our 
courts. I shall abide by whatever 
judgment is made.” 

“You're d-damn right you will,” 
Steve said. “You will also keep 
your big mouth shut for once and 
let Harry do all the talking. This 
time.” 

“I am opposed to progress,” said 
Frank simply. “The Common Law 
will deliver me.” 

The Harry referred to was Harry 
Shapiro, an attorney famous for 
having successfully argued on be- 
half of a number of unconventional 
clients, including a lady who had 
put her fist through a glass door 
(Shapiro had won her substantial 
damages for cuts and abrasions as 
well as mental anguish), a bigamist 
being sued simultaneously by both 
wives (Harry proved both suits in- 
valid because his client had not 
been convicted of bigamy), and a 
contractor who had run up a 
twenty-story building on the wrong 
site. 

Steve, Aurelie and Appalachia

occupied the front row during 
Frank’s hearing. To begin with, 
counsel for the plaintiff, an “inter- 
ested citizen,” argued that no per- 
son who had been born — or manu- 
factured — on the date it was 
stipulated Frank had been turned 
out in the van Ten Bosch labora- 
tory, was old enough to hold office 
as a Representative and that 
Frank’s election should be 
nullified. 

Harry Shapiro rose to the occa- 
sion like a porpoise to sunshine. A 
small man, gray and squinting, 
with the voice of a cannon, he 
called a curious bevy of wit- 
nesses — a man with a metal hand, 
another with a prosthetic leg, a sur- 
geon who testified to implanting an 
artificial kidney and the patient 
with the said kidney. Of each Sha- 
piro inquired the date of birth, the 
date of installation of the particu- 
lar prosthesis, calling attention to 
the fact that the date of one had no 
connection with the other. His 
point was clear long before he had 
finished. The parade was closed 
with the most important witness of 
all. 

Dr. van Ten Bosch looked much 
the same as he had the day Steve 
first laid eyes on him — the day Au- 
relie had said. This is Daddy — he’s 
so far out in left field he’s playing 
in another league. His bushy white 
hair was wild. His eyes were glow- 
ing embers. His mouth was set in a 
perpetual sneer. 

He began by refusing to be 
sworn. “Hocus-pocus for super- 
stitious minds. [ will say my say 
and if you think it is untrue, convict 
me of perjury.” 

“I shall fine you for contempt of 



court instead,” said the judge. “1 
will allow you to affirm, if you 
prefer.” 

“It’s all humbug,” snarled Ten 
Bosch. “This I will affirm with all 
my heart.” 

One of the jurymen looked so 
pleased at this that Steve suspected 
he had been planted by one or the 
other lawyer. Then, under Sha- 
piro’s sharp questioning. Ten 
Bosch affirmed that he had been at 
a loss for a particular part and in 
his haste had made use, in Frank’s 
construction, of the handiest sub- 
stitute, a transformer from a 
Ihirty-five-year-old radio that was 
lying around. 

O pposing counsel called no 
witnesses. He addressed the 
jury. 

“Ladies and gentlemen. It has 
seldom been my pleasure to look 
upon a jury so alert, so clearly un- 
biased, so eager to weigh the evi- 
dence and bring in a patriotic ver- 
dict — it is really superfluous for me 
to address you. My learned adver- 
sary has proved that the date of a 
mechanical appliance does not in- 
validate the date of birth or manu- 
facture. Now the date of manufac- 
ture of this mechanical thing, 
known as Four-X alias Frank Mer- 
riwell, is less than twenty-five years 
ago, consequently, even if he were a 
sentient human being — which he is 
not as I shall demonstrate to your 
satisfaction — he would not be old 
enough to serve in Congress. My 
learned friend would like to date 
his creation from the installation of 
a part from a thirty-five-year-old 
radio. Why not from the date his 
metal was mined? This is nonsense.- 



98 



GALAXY 




Suppose a man uses his grand- 
father’s false teeth — does this date 
his birth from that of his grand- 
father’s dentistry? Let -us assume, 
as my learned opponent might im- 
ply if he thought of it, that this 
transformer or transistor or tran- 
substaniator is of such importance 
that this mechanical oddity could 
not exist without it. Does this lend 
weight? I think not. 1 think not. 
Consider the case of a baby born 
at midnight. The head, clearly 
the most important part of 
a Congressman — ahem — (laughter 
from the jury) — clearly the most 
important part, emerges at eleven 
fifty-nine, the legs only at twelve- 
oh-one. The baby is credited to the 
later day, not the earlier. I’m sure 
this disposes of learned counsel’s 
spare parts. Your honor, if the 
court please, 1 meant no disrespect 
to my colleague. I spoke only of 
what was brought forth in his direct 
examination. 1 withdraw spare 
parts and speak instead of the 
transformer by which my learned 
adversary would transform this 
machine into a human being. But 
with a jury such as I see before me 
he cannot do it. I repeat, he cannot 
do it. For what is the definition of a 
sentient human being, capable of 
bearing responsibility of election to 
a governing body? Why, he must be 
able to distinguish between right 
and wrong. Is this the function of a 
machine? Members of the jury, you 
know as well as 1 that no machine 
can distinguish between right and 
wrong. If it could, our whole judi- 
cial system would fall to the 
ground — we would install ma- 
chines to return our verdicts and 
other machines to pass sentences.” 



Here the jury began yawning. “A 
machine cannot weep, cannot 
laugh, and without tears or laugh- 
ter how can one say, ‘This is good 
or this is evil?’” A juryman dozed. 
“Ladies and gentlemen, I thank 
you.” 

Without leaving the box the jury 
brought in a verdict for Frank. The 
court recapitulated by saying that 
if a man had an artificial leg made 
in 1960 this didn’t invalidate his 
having been born in 1930. On the 
other hand, his having parts dating 
from 1930 is prima facie evidence 
of his having existed at that time. 
As for learned counsel’s argument 
that ability to distinguish between 
right and wrong defined the capa- 
bility to serve in Congress — this 
was the first time he had heard of 
this doctrine. He, the court, wished 
it could be applied, and rigorously. 
To resume, right and wrong were 
absolutes — the court had no sym- 
pathy with notions that they were 
relative matters. But to a savage 
from the wilds of New Guinea (he 
meant no disrespect to that distin- 
guished member of the United Na- 
tions — this was only by way of ex- 
ample) it was necessary to instill a 
concept of what constituted social 
as opposed to antisocial behavior 
in western culture. No testimony 
had been offered that Mr. Merri- 
well had not had such concepts in- 
culcated. As for machines taking 
over the judicial functions, he for 
one would welcome such a relief. 
The court warmly agreed with the 
jury’s eminently sensible verdict 
and gave judgment and costs to the 
defendant whom he congratulated 
on his recent political victory. 
(Cheers.)

ftQOMEHOW,” said Appa- 
Olachia/M’ve begun to think of 
Frank as one who can’t lose.” 
“Why, of course, dear,” said 
Aurelie. “What else?” 

While he was in Congress Frank 
helped curb highway building, tar- 
iff-raising, defense-spending. He 
voted no on practically everything, 
including funds for the un-Ameri- 
can Activities Committee, except 
foreign aid — as long as it didn’t in- 
clude munitions (“Isolation is 
progress.”), cultural exchanges (“I 
am opposed to schools, not to 
knowledge.”), increased income 
taxes in the upper brackets 
(“Wealth is progress. Let us have 
primitive equality.”), and pro- 
grams calling for aid to artists and 
writers. (“Art knows nothing of 
progress. Even James Joyce is not 
an improvement on Laurence 
Sterne.”) He introduced a bill to 
tax all advertising and voted for 
higher taxes on cigarettes but to re- 
move all excise on liquors. (“As 
well tax cheese,” he said. “Fermen- 
tation is a natural process.”) He 
voted to favor labor unions (“The 
most unprogressive force in the 
country.”), and for civil rights 
(“Enslaving the black man is 
progress — he was free before the 
white man set foot in Dahomey.”) 
Despite his stand on civil rights, 
southern politicians were not unfa- 
vorably inclined toward the Merri- 
well-for-President boom. What 
better solution to the bitter pill of 
integration than the abolition of 
schools altogether? Before the New 
Hampshire primary Frank had a 
hundred pledged delegates from 
Dixie. Steve Woolsey — noting one 
day in his office how the sun on 



Appalachia’s skin made him think 
of a vacation in the tropics — said, 
“Frank’s career has been too 
quick, too s-slick. He may even get 
the nomination. But he isn’t ready 
for the P-Presidency.” 

“How’s that?’’ asked Appa- 
lachia, tenderly scratching a pale 
brown arm with long brown fin- 
gers. “It seems to me he was born 
ready — and I use the word born in 
the broad legal sense. He goes 
straight to his objective.” She 
sighed. “Sometimes 1 wish — ” 
Steve, all politics, ignored the 
sigh and the unfinished sentence. 
“The worst drawback and the one 
we c-can’t do anything about is his 
n-not being married. No one except 
Buchanan and Cleveland has been 
elected who wasn’t married. Jack- 
son was a widower.” 

“So was Jefferson,” she re- 
minded him. “Not being married 
won’t hurt him with the old maids. 
Besides — ” 

“Go on.” 

“He’ll get married.” 

“How can he? 1 mean he’s not — 
Who would marry him?” 

“Aurelie van Ten Bosch, of 
course. He was made for her.” 
Stevenson waited for the impact 
of the shock to crush him. All the 
time he had known Aurelie would 
throw him over for another man. 
Another man, that is. He had al- 
ways feared she would give the 
heart he could never quite com- 
mand to a four-minute miler or a 
centerfielder batting .400 or a 
pitcher winning twenty-five games 
in a season — or even a catcher. But 
this was — this was . Words, even 
stuttered ones, failed him. A ma- 
chine candidate, he remembered at 



100 



GALAXY 




last. He had groomed his own rival. 
And yet — somehow he wasn’t 
shattered. If Aurelie really per- 
ferred the Tin Woodman to the 
Wizard of Oz her mind was not 
functioning, poor girl. Per- 
haps — perhaps she would realize 
her mistake before it was too late. 
If only she were as sensible as — as, 
say, someone like Appalachia Lee. 
Feminine, yet with a grasp of real- 
ity .. 

ILTON OGILVIE broke the 
story of the engagement three 
days later. Four days after that 
Congressman Merriwell and his 
betrothed eloped to Mexico. No 
Presidential aspirant could have 
asked for a better press. Frank, ev- 
ery black-Irish hair of his wig 
smoothed not quite enough to hide 
the slight wave, was quoted as 
saying, “1 am opposed to all 
progress,” while astride a burro in 
Sonora with his wife riding pillion. 
Swimming at Puerto Vallarte — 
Frank’s torso in sunburned make- 
up looked as good as any other on 
the beach — he challenged the use- 
fulness of computers, praised the 
abacus and the quill pen, denounced 
submarines, elevators and mini- 
skirts. In all the pictures, Aurelie 
was radiant. 

“That’s what the caption says,” 
muttered Steve gloomily. “What’s 
she got to be radiant about?” 

“I asked her the same thing,” 
admitted Appalachia. “You might 
call it feminine curiousity. All she 
did was give me a look and say, 
‘Science is wonderful, progress or 
no progress.’” 

“N-nonsense. A girl like you — ” 

“Yes, go on,” urged Appalachia. 



“What about a girl like me?” 

“I was only going to say a g-girl 
like you wouldn’t settle for s- 
science. Progress or no progress.” 

“Oh, Stevenson, you do have the 
neatest way of putting things. In a 
nutshell.” 

“I c-could have been on the de- 
bating team if it wasn’t for m-my s- 
stutter.” 

“I think your stutter is 
adorable.” 

Frank continued his winning 
streak. He won the New Hamp- 
shire primary. He was nosed out in 
North Dakota but swept Wisconsin 
and Nebraska. He carried Oregon 
and got most of the California 
delegates. He went to the conven- 
tion with four hundred votes and 
Steve Woolsey worked out a deal 
with the runner-up for the Vice 
Presidency. Frank was nominated 
on the first ballot. 

His opponent was a maverick 
Kennedy who had as running mate 
an equally maverick Rockefeller. 
“Young” (fifty) Kennedy declared, 
“1 am for progress. I don’t intend 
to give up the steam locomotive or 
the steel plow for any renegade 
who has turned against the very 
force that created it. The only 
progress I’m dubious about is that 
which allows artificial men to run 
for office. When the steel plow was 
first invented they said it would 
poison the soil. When the first pas- 
sengers traveled at a hair-raising 
fifteen miles an hour by locomotive 
they were warned they would hem- 
orrhage to death. Those are the 
kind of people who are against 
progress and want to go back to the 
hoe and the handcart.” 

“My esteemed opponent,” re-

plied Frank smoothly, “is for the 
steel plow — the plow that broke the 
plains and gave us the dustbowl of 
the nineteen-thirties. He is for the 
steam locomotive — which is now to 
be found only in museums. If this is 
the kind of progress my opponents 
are for, let' me say, Go to the mu- 
seums and dustbowls, my friends, 
a.nd give us pure air and pure 
food . .” But it really didn’t 
rhatter what Frank said. People 
asked themselves for the first time 
what progress had brought them. 
Installment buying? Planned obso- 
lescence? Devitalized food? The 
AMA? Electric lights that burned 
out as fast as they could be re- 
placed? Automobiles that broke 
down carrying people at eighty 
miles an hour to new billboards, 
new hot-dog stands? Jerry-built 
housing developments that became 
slums before the crumbling houses 
were paid for? H-bombs? Napalm? 
Starvation in Mississippi and New 
Mexico? The UN? Policemen, cen- 
sors and the PTA? Cities with ele- 
phantiasis? Fashions? Caramel-col- 
ored grain neutral spirits? A moral- 
ity based on The Pill? Enough 
people came up with an answer to 
elect Frank. He carried every state 
but Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, 
South Carolina and Vermont. He 
even squeaked through in Maine 
and Florida. 



A t his inaugration Frank 
wore a three-cornered hat with 
a red-white-and-blue cockade and 
rode down Pennsylvania Avenue 
in an open horse-drawn carriage. 
The music for the Inaugural Ball 
was provided by hurdy-gurdies. In 



doing over the White House Aure- 
lie had the electric lights ripped 
out and candles ordered for the 
chandeliers. The Master Chandlers 
Association sent her a set of an- 
tique brass bedwarmers in token of 
gratitude. A golden age dawned. 

Except for a few scattered die- 
hards, Frank Merriwell’s view had 
become the popular view. People 
discovered a new content, even a 
new prosperity in abandoning tele- 
vision, the all-electric kitchen and 
the princess telephone in every 
room. All open-air movie theaters 
were turned into archery ranges, 
and cracker barrels returned to the 
corner groceries. Advertising was 
so heavily taxed that Madison Ave- 
nue became a ghost street. Auto- 
mobiles were not prohibited, but 
they were considered to be a sign of 
drivers who hadn’t yet made it into 
the horsey set. Smoke and soot 
gradually vanished from the 
shrinking cities as factory after fac- 
tory for manufacturing useless gad- 
gets closed down. 

And there were charming fringe 
benefits. One week Aurelie ap- 
peared in public in a fascinator and 
the next every secretary from Bos- 
ton to Los Angeles appeared in fas- 
cinators. Of course, the country 
had fewer secretaries (and book- 
keepers and time-study experts) 
now that competition among 
businesses was slackening. Wim- 
ples became popular. Most girls 
stayed home to bake bread, be wed 
young and discover that large fam- 
ilies sharing the burdens of the 
household could accomplish more 
with greater ease than all the silent, 
automatic mobilmaid, pop-up, 
snap-on, drip-dry, and press-to-re-

lease items had in the dreary past. 

Sociologists studied the phenom- 
enon and announced it was a per- 
fectly normal synthesis brought 
about by the pressure of the new fe- 
minism versus the new antifemin- 
ism and would have happened 
without Frank Merriwell, he being 
only the product of his age and not 
vice versa. It is doubtful if Presi- 
dent Merriwell ever scanned it, he 
being busy with the erection and 
dedication of the grandest of 
Washington’s memorials, that de- 
dicated to Sir William Schwenck 
Gilbert, the only non-American 
ever to be so honored. As the 
President cut the ribbon before the 
mammoth replica of the Savoy 
Theater, he said tersely, “He was 



absolutely against all progress.” 

Receiving the account by special 
courier who had used up several 
relays of horses, Stevenson Wool- 
sey absently laid the heavy parch- 
ment aside. 

“Appalachia — what an appall- 
ing name for such a g-girl. May I 
call you P-Polly?” 

“Oh, Steve — all my life I’ve 
wanted to be called Polly. Now I’ll 
never let anyone call me anything 
else.” 

“Well, no use going overb-board 
about it. Appalachia’s still your le- 
gal name, you know. Appalachia 
Lee. You think it might sound 
awkward if you changed it to Polly 
Woolsey?”

Author delivers wife of daughter in east 
coast national forest. Fiction? No, fact! 
Six years ago Ward Moore and wife Raylyn 
were traveiing up the coast when about- 
to-be daughter Sara arrived at her des- 
tination, sometime before her parents 
reached theirs. Moore, already the patri- 
arch of several grown families, delivered 
the newest member of the tribe. 

"There has always been a certain 
amount of imagination effervescent in 
my family," Ward Moore writes us. "One of 
my maternal ancestors 'ran — ' so help 
me that's the verb in the encyclopedia, 
' — through Italy and Istria in the 16th cen- 
tury, proclaiming the imminent coming 
of the Messiah . .' " A fine heritage for an 
sf writer! 

"What have I been doing in the past few 
years." Moore's ietter echoes in response 
to our queries. "I have written three excel- 
lent novels which passed, without the 
change of a word or punctuation mark, 
from being too far ahead of their time to 
being just too old fashioned and conven- 
tional. 

"Also I've been cultivating my garden. 
Why doesn't someone realize that Vol- 




WARD MOORE 



taire wasn't speaking metaphoricaily, but 
quite literally? 

"Of the novels I published before I 
went out of style, there were several: 
Breathe the Air Again, Greener Than You 
Think. Cloud By Day. Bring the Jubilee, 
and Joyleg—a 1962 collaboration with Av- 
ram Davidson."

his hands from just below her waist 
in the back, murmured, “What a 
turn you’ve given me! Just let me 
have a few days to think it over, 
will you? Or at least a few 
minutes?” And she allowed a be- 
coming blush to creep up under her 
milk-chocolate complexion. 

“Frank wants us to go along as 
p-part of his staff to Ulan Bator for 
his summit conference with the 
chairman and party secretary, and 
ninety days on a clipper ship can be 
pretty boresome to those who 
aren’t married — while it would be 
just the thing for a honeymoon.” 

“Why, Stevenson, you romantic 
old darling, you. Three months on 
a sailing ship. Whatever will we 
do?” 

It was something short of a year 
later, after the historic Merriwell 
summit talks had borne fruit and 
the world, stimulated by Frank’s 
honest antagonism to any weapon 
more lethal than a rock, decided to 
scrap every gun, rifle, plane, tank, 
warship, pistol, bayonet and bomb, 
that the unheard-of happened. It 
came first as a laconic statement 
from White House Press Secretary 
Wilton Ogilvie, transmitted by 
heliograph and semaphore all over 
the country and around the world: 

“After the most conscientious 
consideration. President Merriwell 
has decided to resign.” 

Pressed immediately for reasons, 
Ogilvie gave out his next commu- 
nique: “The President is taking this 
step because he feels his objectives 
have been achieved and progress is 
at an end.” 

All over the world heads of state 
dropped whatever they were doing 
to call Frank Merriwell — they for- 



got or ignored the open secret of 
his origin — ” A great human being 
. .” “A man for the ages. .” “A 
soul to admire . and so on. 

Some reporter even got to 
Frank’s father-in-law, nested as be- 
fitted Frank’s position in a hermit’s 
cave high up in the Great Smokies, 
complete with bats and familiars. 
Madder than ever, too, he took full 
credit for everything. “I made 
Frank Merriwell,” he said for pub- 
lication by various town criers. “I 
made him what he is. I promised 1 
would destroy civilization and I 
have done so. What little nests of 
progress remain in isolated spots 
will disappear in a few years as 
soon as the formulas for soft drinks 
and calculating the velocity of light 
have been forgotten. We have won, 
beaten all the false prophets, kept 
the human race from going to the 
stars in order to build a heaven on 
Earth.” 

Mrs. Merriwell, invited to com- 
ment on her father’s pronounce- 
ment, said only, “Oh, Daddy’s an 
old fuddy-duddy, still living back in 
the scientific age.” First Ladyship 
had done well by Aurelie. Her 
charms were the delight of the 
wood-engravers who had succeeded 
the photographers. 

The clincher came at the press 
conference when they asked Frank 
Merriwell what, as ex-President, he 
proposed to do. He said, “I’ve had 
an offer from — ” in the pause a 
score of minds filled in: the Vati- 
can, Oxford University, The So- 
ciety for the Rights of Man, the 
Reunited Nations. But Frank fin- 
ished, “ — the Mets, which I’ve de- 
cided to take.” 

So he did. ★

He could stop the world, but 
would it let him get off? 



JUST 

A MATTER 
OF TIME 

^UEFFREY PERRIN 




W HEN Paul Martin reached his 
office he found a message on 
his desk: Dr. Arno called. He 
would like to see you at the lab 
when you have a chance. 

He immediately depressed the 
key on his squawk box and told his 
secretary, “Miss Carter, cancel 
all my appointments today. Tell 
anyone who calls that I will have 
to get back to them tomorrow. 
Get me a company helicruiser. 
Oh, yes, and call Dr. Arno and tell 
him that I’ll be over in twenty min- 
utes.” 

The helicruiser was waiting by 
the time he reached the roof. He 
did not often rush like this. But it 
would be foolish to play executive 
games with Arno, who was com- 
pletely impervious to them. Dr. 
Arno was not just another mem- 
ber of the research staff. He was a 
rare combination; a brilliant 
physicist whose findings often 
made sense in dollars. 

Martin had set him up with a lab 
of his own and had given him a 
very significant budget for equip- 
ment and supplies and complete 
freedom to pursue whatever re- 
search he wished. Probably ninety 
per cent of his time was spent on 
pet theories that, even if proven, 
could not possibly have any com- 
mercial application. But the oth- 
er ten per cent had made Martin 
Electronics great. The 150-year 
fuel cell, so necessary for the out- 
er colonies; the loop drive, which 
was the single largest break- 



through in the development of 
interstellar travel; the multi- 
polarized memory cell, which re- 
duced room-sized computers to six 
cubic feet and made them a com- 
mon household item — these were 
just a few of the revolutionary ad- 
vances that had begun with Arno’s 
research. 

Martin’s train of thought was 
broken as he spotted the R&D 
complex below. Off to the left, 
apart from the other labs, was Dr. 
Arno’s facility, a two-story struc- 
ture containing over 25 million 
credits’ worth of equipment and 
one man. Arno generally worked 
alone. When he needed help he 
could requisition personnel at will 
from the other R&D facilities in 
the complex. Currently he was 
working alone. 

He was out on the roof, waiting 
for Martin, as the helicruiser 
landed. This meant that whatever 
he had been working on was com- 
pleted. While he was still working 
on something not even a fire could 
drive him from his lab, much less 
anything as trivial as a visit by the 
boss. 

In fact, Arno did not actually 
greet the head of Martin Elec- 
tronics. Without even a hello, 
Arno had Paul Martin by the arm 
and was dragging him quickly in- 
to the lab as he talked in that rapid, 
machine-gun style of his about 
quantum physics and time and 
about shaking the very founda- 
tions of conventional physical

JUST A MATTER OF TIME 




thinking. Martin let it all go in 
one ear and out the other as he 
was rushed down the corridors. He 
knew that once he got Arno calmed 
down, he would hear it all over 
again in simple layman’s lan- 
guage, which was all that he un- 
derstood. Paul Martin was a busi- 
nessman. He did not have the 
slightest knowledge of science, [f 
you were to tell him what a ma- 
chine did he would neve’" ask — 
nor would he care — how it 
worked. But, faster than any other 
man in the galaxy, he could come 
up with twenty-five commercial 
applications and a hundred 
major markets. 

A S HE entered Dr. Arno’s of- 
fice Martin saw on the desk a 
metal box about two inches by five 
inches by eight inches, a pair of 
coveralls and some wires leading 
from the box to the coveralls. That 
had to be it, whatever “it” was, he 
decided. 

He soon got Arno calmed down 
and had him begin all over again 
under the usual ground rules — 
namely, in simple English. 

“Well, ever since the birth of 
quantum physics at the begin- 
ning of the twentieth century 
there has been speculation as to 
whether or not time is quantized.” 
“You’re getting closer to the 
mother tongue — but you’re not 
yet quite there.” 

“Well, let me give you an exam- 
ple. You know a little about elec- 



tricity. Now, given a sufficient 
power source, can you get any 
specific amount of electric charge 
that you want?” 

“Of course.” 

“Wrong. Because there is an ab- 
solute unit of electric charge, 
namely the charge of one elec- 
tron. So you can get the charge of 
one billion electrons or one bil- 
lion and one electrons, but you 
can’t get the charge of one billion 
and a half electrons. So we say 
that electricity is quantized. 
Heat, on the other hand, is not 
quantized. You can get any 
specific amount of heat.” 

“But the difference between one 
billion electrons and a billion 
and a half is too trivial to make any 
difference.” 

“That’s true in any normal use 
of electricity. But the fact that 
electricity is quantized has im- 
mense scientific significance. 
Now, we were talking about time. 
As I was saying, physicists have 
long argued over whether time is 
or is not quantized. Given the 
limitations of our measuring de- 
vices, we have not been able to an- 
swer the question — until now. 1 
have always believed that it is. 
Just a gut reaction, mind you, not 
based on any experimental data. 
But I’ve been playing with the idea 
in experimental applications on 
and off for several years — and I’ve 
finally proved my point. Just as we 
can isolate a single electron, the 
quantum of electricity, I have de- 



108 



GALAXY 




veloped a device that can isolate a 
single quantum of time.” 

Paul Martin let this last state- 
ment sift through his mind, but 
without results. He could not un- 
derstand what the machine did. 

“Let me demonstrate.” 

Dr. Arno slowly put on the 
coveralls, taking care not to dis- 
connect any of the thin wires link- 
ing them with the black metal box. 
They covered him completely ex- 
cept for his head. Then he hooked 
the box onto the belt, thus leaving 
his hands free. As Martin closely 
watched, he reached over and 
pushed a button on the box. 

Suddenly he was not there. 

Martin choked. He closed his 
eyes tightly, looked again at the 
spot where Dr. Arno had stood. He 
refused to believe his eyes. 

“Well?” 

His heart skipped a beat as he 
spun around to face the voice. Dr. 
Arno was sitting in a chair by the 
door. 

“But this is impossible! It’s- 
— it’s teleportation!” 

“Nonsense. First of all, it was 
not teleportation. 1 walked lei- 
surely from the desk to this chair 
and sat down. Secondly, 1 doubt 
that teleportation is impossible, 
although I’ve never tried lo ex- 
periment with it. But that is an 
idea. Maybe when this is per- 
fected — ” 

“But, but you couldn't have 
walked to that chair. I saw you 
standing by the desk one instant 



and suddenly you were in that 
chair.” 

“Yet it wasn’t instantaneous. In 
your time reckoning, it took one 
time quantum, approximately 
one three-hundred-thousandth of 
a second. I haven’t yet computed 
it exactly. This device slipped me 
into one time quantum and kept 
me there for about two minutes in 
my time. Your time — and that 
means the whole rest of the uni- 
verse except me — was frozen in- 
to one three-hundred-thousandth 
of a second, while I had about two 
minutes to walk around.” 

“1 just can’t understand what 
happened. I can’t believe my 
senses. 1 can’t-” 

As he was speaking Dr. Arno 
pushed the button again and Paul 
Martin was talking to an empty 
chair. Dr. Arno was seated behind 
his desk. 

“Here, try it,” he said as he 
started to get out of the coveralls. 
“It can’t hurt you.” 

D espite this pledge it took 
quite some time to coax Martin 
into the coveralls. He protested 
the entire time that Dr. Arno was 
stuffing him into them. Arno 
later described the experience as 
similar to that of clothing a young 
child, who had not mastered but- 
tons, zippers, or shoelaces. But 
finally Paul Martin was set. 

“Now wait a minute while I get a 
coin. Let me know when you’re 
about to push the button and I’ll 



J UST A matte R of time 



109 




drop it. The result should be im- 
pressive.” 

Arno reached into his pocket 
and got out a ten-centicredit coin. 
“Okay. Go ahead.” 

Martin drew up his courage and 
reached for the button. Just as he 
saw Dr. Arno drop the coin, he 
closed his eyes and pushed the but- 
ton. 

Nothing happened. Everything 
felt the same. He tried moving his 
hands, and they worked perfectly. 
Then it dawned on him that he had 
not heard the coin drop. 

He slowly opened his eyes. Arno 
was frozen in place. The coin was 
suspended in midair. There was no 
sound. The sound waves were not 
moving through the air. 

It was all a dream. Half in a 
daze, he moved toward the coin. 
He reached his hand out and 
touched it gingerly. It did not 
move. He drew his hand back and 
then tried again. 

This time the coin dropped to the 
floor. 

"Your two minutes are up.” It 
was reassuring to hear Arno’s 
voice, to be back in the real world 
again. “You look pretty shaken 
up. I was, too, the first few times. 
It takes some getting used to. I’ll 
never forget my first time. It was 
only about ten seconds then, not 
two minutes. And lucky for me 
that it was. I hadn’t anticipated 
that the air molecules wouldn’t 
move, so I couldn’t breathe. Since 
then, I extended the field a bit in 



front of the face to correct that 
problem.” 

But Martin was not listening. He 
was still trying to believe that 
what had just iiappened had real- 
ly happened. He could not quite 
convince himself. 

They sat and discussed it some 
more. Then he tried the experi- 
ment again. He was still shaky, but 
no longer in a stupor. The third 
time he was confident in his 
movements. The fourth time he 
enjoyed. 

By the time he left the lab it was 
evening. He decided to fly straight 
home, rather than return to his 
office. He knew that he could not 
work any more that day. He had a 
lot of thinking to do. His entire 
concept of the universe seemed 
shattered. All he wanted in the 
whole world just then was a drink, 
a hot shower and a stretch of soli- 
tude in which to think. 

T HOME he found all three. 
Margaret had taken the chil- 
dren down to Buenos Aires that 
morning for the November 
Carnival. It was a two-day af- 
fair — they were not due back until 
the following evening. 

He still had not been able to 
think up any salable uses for the 
device, but he felt certain that 
there must be some. Part of his 
agreement with Dr. Arno was that 
anything he could see a com- 
mercial use for belonged ex- 
clusively to the company. Any- 




110 



GALAXY 




thing else Arno was free to pub- 
lish. It did Martin’s ego a world of 
good whenever he thought about 
how, of the hundreds of papers 
that Arno had published on all 
sorts of topics, no one else had ever 
come up with a commercial appli- 
cation. If he couldn’t, nobody 
could. 

Dr. Arno felt that he would be 
publishing this one and he was 
looking forward to it. He was 
really a child at heart. There had 
been a look of pure, mischievous 
glee in his eyes when he had told 
Martin he would spring his latest 
findings on the next meeting of 
the World Physical Society with- 
out any advance warning — and 
then watch their faces as he 
destroyed the very foundations of 
their thinking with his announce- 
ment. 

Around midnight Martin had 
pretty much decided that this was 
another of Arno’s ninety per- 
centers, but he vowed to think 
about it some more the next day. In 
the meantime, if he were to sleep 
that night, he had to get the ma- 
chine off his mind. He flipped on 
the screen to catch the late news. 

It rapidly took his mind off Dr. 
Arno’s new invention. It gave him 
something far more serious to 
think about. The first item was that 
Stardeck IV had limped into 
Outer Station XI. It had been hit 
by a meteor and would be at least 
six months in repair. 

Martin had three million credits 



invested in that venture and he 
had borrowed the entire sum. In 
fourteen days, he had to meet a 
100,000-credit payment. If the 
ship had returned on schedule, he 
would have netted at least 200,000 
to 250,000 credits, more than 
enough to meet the payment. But 
right now his cash was tied up. 

To make matters worse, the 
collateral for his loan was six mil- 
lion credits worth of Martin Elec- 
tronics stock. If he failed to meet 
that payment the First Galaxy 
Commercial Bank could call the 
entire loan and sell enough of the 
stock to raise it. The stock was un- 
registered and not free to trade. 
With such stock, sold privately, 
you could only figure on receiv- 
ing about half of the market value 
of free stock. That meant that the 
bank might have to sell Martin’s 
entire holdings. 

He went over all of his records, 
looking for the means to raise 
100,000 credits quickly. He woke 
his accountant and had him join 
the hunt. There was no way. Near- 
ly all of his assets were frozen and 
could not be converted to cash in 
only fourteen days. 

He lay in bed awake all night, 
thinking and smoking one syn- 
thetic cigarette after another. By 
dawn he had not slept, but he had 
the embryo of a plan. Instead of 
going to the office that morning, 
he returned to Dr. Arno’s lab. 

“How long can you keep some- 
one in a time quantum? Can you 

111 



JUST A MATTER OF TIME 




extend it beyond the current two 
minutes?” 

“Yes, but not much more, since 
the power supply must be self- 
contained. I’d say the upside limit 
is in the four- to five-minute 
range.” 

“I’d like you to build me anoth- 
er device with the following 
specifications — ” He took a piece 
of paper from the desk drawer and 
wrote: 

1. Time freeze 4-5 min- 
utes. 

2. Coveralls can be worn 
under street clothing, with 
clothing included in the 
field. 

3. Mechanism built into 
conventional attache case, 
with button on outside of 
case. Remainder of case free 
to carry other materials. 

4. Only one wire, leading 
from case to waist of cover- 
alls, which can be plugged 
and unplugged at case end. 

He handed the paper to Arno. 
“Well, can you do it?” 

“Of course. There’s nothing 
really different here except the 
packaging and upping the power 
source.” 

“How long will it take you?” 

“If 1 convert the one I already 
built — about a week.” 

“If you don’t work on anything 
else except this?” 

“Then I guess about three days. 



But I don’t see the reason for all 
the rush.” 

“I’ve got a very good reason, 
but I can’t discuss it with you now. 
I’ll be back Friday afternoon to 
pick up the unit.” 

H e called Miss Carter to tell 
her that he would not be in for 
the rest of the day and asked her to 
pacify all callers as best she could. 
His next stop was the financial 
district, where he visited several 
banks. He spent most time at the 
First Galaxy Commercial, which 
he considered the source of his 
problems. 

He kept his usual office hours 
during the rest of the week. The 
time seemed to him to pass re- 
markably slowly. He spoke with 
no one at the office and during 
evenings he avoided Margaret and 
the children. Nothing mattered 
until he picked up the machine at 
Arno’s lab on Friday. 

Over the weekend he tried hard 
to act as if he realized that 
Margaret and the children were 
alive, but he did not succeed. By 
Sunday night his children hated 
him and his wife was insisting 
that he see a psychiatrist. But he 
knew that a great weight would be 
lifted from his shoulders tomor- 
row and he would be able to live 
and enjoy again. After an eternal, 
sleepless night Monday morning 
finally dawned. 

As soon as he was alone he 
called Miss Carter to tell her that 



112

he had an urgent business meet- 
ing and would not be in today. 
Then he got into the coveralls and 
put on a business suit over them. 
He called for a taxi, put on a top- 
coat and leather gloves, picked up 
his special attache case and an- 
nounced at the door that he had an 
early meeting and would have to 
eat breakfast on the way. 

“1 really don’t think you should 
go in today, dear. You haven’t 
been yourself lately.” 

“Oh, ridiculous. Marge. I’ve had 
a few rough days worrying about 
one particular problem. This 
meeting today should solve it.” 

“Well, I don’t like it. But if you 
insist on going, at least have some 
coffee before you leave.” 

“No time. But I promise you 
that I’ll have a cup before my first 
appointment.” He kissed her 
tenderly and left. The taxi was 
waiting. He gave an address in the 
outskirts of the financial district. 
He would walk the last several 
blocks. 

He paused outside the entrance 
of the First Galaxy Commercial 
Bank and ran through his mind 
exactly what he was going to do. 
He examined every detail of his 
plan for the hundredth time, look- 
ing for areas of possible trouble. 
Having decided for the hun- 
dredth time that there were none he 
lifted his head, threw back his 
shoulders and strode into the 
bank. 

Once inside, he did not hesitate. 



He knew exactly what to do. He 
walked directly to the lounge area, 
where people filled out forms and 
waited to see loan officials. From 
it, he had an unobstructed view of 
the entrance to one particular 
teller’s cage. It had one of those 
buzzer contraptions that let you 
in after you were recognized. 

He unfolded a newspaper and, 
under its cover, plugged the wire 
from his clothes into the attache 
case. He then settled back, feigned 
reading and watched the buzzing 
door. Many people entered and 
left by it. Eventually one of them 
would open the door wide enough 
for a second person to pass. He 
would not have to keep it that way 
for long. One three-hundred- 
thousandth of a second was quite 
sufficient. 

J OHN MARLOW awoke early 
that morning. He came to sneez- 
ing, his eyes running. Numerous 
pills and nose sprays later he again 
felt like a functioning human 
being. He cursed the generations 
of medical researchers who had 
broken the backs of cancer, heart 
disease and most infectious 
diseases, but who still could offer 
nothing better against hay fever 
than temporary relief. Every- 
where men with artificial hearts, 
livers, kidneys or lungs walked the 
streets, but no one yet had arti- 
ficial sinuses. Nor would anyone 
ever have them, most likely. 

What annoyed him most was the 



JUST A MATTER OF TIME 



113 




fact that it was man-made pol- 
lutants in the air that made the 
lives of men such as himself so un- 
bearable. 

His job as an executive trainee at 
the First Galaxy Commercial was 
neither interesting nor chal- 
lenging. There was precious little 
training. One was simply made to 
endure a period of menial servi- 
tude before he was given mean- 
ingful work. Most of his time v as 
spent on such essentials as re- 
tabulating figures already calcu- 
lated by a computer, checking for 
errors (in eighteen months he had 
yet to find one), going out for cof- 
fee and counting the days until he 
would be performing useful 
work. He smiled at the thought 
that at least today he would prob- 
ably have occasional fits of sneez- 
ing to break the monotony. Viewed 
in that light, his hay fever no longer 
appeared so unredeemingly awful. 

Once the customers began to ar- 
rive he was able to make the time 
pass more quickly by practicing 
his people-watching hobby. The 
bank was a good place for it, be- 
cause it drew a lovely assortment 
of strange characters. There was 
the old woman who came every 
Monday to open her safe deposit 
box and look fondly at her jewels 
and stock certificates. There was a 
chap in the lounge who sat caress- 
ing an attache case as if it con- 
tained a key to the wealth of the 
universe. 

A call interrupted his observa- 



tions to inform him that the com- 
puter runs were ready. He went to 
the computer room to get the four 
copies for the day. Each was a lit- 
tle over two inches thick and con- 
tained over six pounds of paper. 
Unfolded, they would probably 
stretch clear to the uptown 
branch. Ted, a programer, piled 
them on Marlow’s outstretched 
arms and he backed out of the 
room with his burden. He deliv- 
ered one to Mr. Gate’s office and 
that staid, gentleman removed 
the top copy from the pile. The 
weight drop to eighteen pounds felt 
good. 

Delivering the two copies to the 
teller’s cage required him to cross 
the lobby, bend at the knees with 
his back straight and his arms 
parallel to the floor so that he 
could push an annoyingly low 
buzzer to request entry. As he 
crouched, pressing the buzzer, he 
realized that there would be an 
added difficulty today. He felt the 
beginnings and then the rumbling 
growth of a monumental sneeze. 
There was no place handy for him 
to put down the runs, so he hur- 
ridly balanced them on his left 
arm, using his right to grope for a 
tissue in his jacket pocket. 

The buzzer rang. Clutching the 
runs with his left arm and the tis- 
sue with his right hand, he pushed 
open the door with his back and 
turned to enter. But the sneeze was 
upon him. As he doubled over he 
felt the runs slip from his arm and

the tissue fly from his hand, driv- 
en by the hard, loud gust of air he 
had just expelled. His eyes tearing 
and half closed, he tried to grab 
both simultaneously. In doing so 
he pushed the door open wide. 

Across the lobby, Paul Martin 
pressed a small black button on 
the attache case he was holding on 
his lap, under his newspaper. 

VERYONE froze. Everything 
was silent. Paul Martin at- 
tached the case to the hooks he had 
secured to his belt and crossed the 
lobby. As he slipped past the 
crouching figure, frozen as it 
grasped toward a falling stack of 
paper and a solitary tissue 
suspended in the air before it, 
Martin’s eyes widened. He would 
not h^^to go any farther. Just off 
to his left, on a shelf, were piled 
packets of twenty- and fifty-credit 
notes, one hundred notes to each 
packet. He counted five packets of 
fifties and eight of twenties. That 
meant 4 1 ,000 credits. 

He glanced at his watch. One 
minute and five seconds had 
passed. A minimum of two min- 
utes, fifty-five seconds were left 
and he had already located all he 
needed at this first stop. He opened 
the attache case and reached for 
the topmost packet of fifties. It 
would not budge. 

He tried again — pushing, pull- 
ing and twisting — but to no avail. 
His mere mortal strength could not 
move a stationary pile of paper 



even a fraction of an inch in one 
three-hundred-thousandth of a 
second. Two minutes were gone. 

In a fury, he attacked the higher 
pile of twenties. He rammed it with 
his shoulder. It was like ramming 
a steel girder. Two minutes, forty 
seconds. He looked around for 
something hard to smash the piles 
with, but he could no more move 
any useful tool than he could the 
money. Three minutes, thirty sec- 
onds. 

In one last effort he clamped his 
hands around the pile of twenties, 
placed both feet high against the 
wall and pushed. It would not 
budge. He strained and pushed 
harder. Still it would not budge. 

He was so wrapped up in his ef- 
fort that he did not notice his grip 
slipping. Suddenly he was flying 
backward through the air. His 
back hit the corner of something 
hard, sharp and unyielding. As he 
felt the expanding blade pierce his 
coat, his jacket and then his skin he 
let out a soundless scream. 

M ARLOW’S right hand sudden- 
ly struck a man. A falling man. 
A screaming man. But where had 
he come from? 

The man hit the ground and lay 
still. He was no longer screaming. 
A pool of blood began to work its 
way out from under his form. 

“What happened?’’ 

“Who is it?’’ 

“What’s going on?’’ 

“Somebody call the police — ’’ 




JUST A MATTER OF TIME 



115 




John Marlow leaned over and 
listened for the stranger’s breath 
and felt for a pulse. He could de- 
tect neither. 

“John, do you know this man? 
What’s he doing in the teller’s 
cage?’’ 

“He’s dead.’’ John Marlow got 
up slowly and moved to a chair. 
He could not understand what 
had happened. He was sure that 
this man had not been in the cage 
the instant before. In fact, wasn’t 
he the gentleman who had been 
sitting in the lounge? Yes, of 
course he was. But that was im- 
possible. Marlow had seen him 
still sitting there, at the other end 
of the lobby, as he backed into the 
teller’s cage. 

Marlow told this to the police 
when they arrived and again at the 
lengthier questioning that took 
place at police headquarters. He 
was noticeably experiencing mild 
shock, so his testimony was con- 
sidered of limited value. 

It was to be many years before 
he completely stopped having at 
least occasional nightmares about 
the screaming man, who suddenly 
appeared before his eyes, only to 
die with a horrible, wide-eyed look 
on his face. 

NEW YORK, Nov. 17 (AP) — 
Autopsy results failed to 
shed any light on the mys- 
terious death of industrialist 
Paul R. Martin, chairman 
and president of Martin 
Electronics Corporation, 



who died on Monday of 
apparently violent causes in 
the main office of the First 
Galaxy Commercial Bank. 

Dr. Andrew Stein, the 
city’s chief medical examiner, 
announced today that death 
was due to internal trauma, 
caused by a sharp object. 
The wound indicated that 
the weapon was flat, rather 
than tapered, and came to a 
point at a 90° angle. 

Although Mr. Martin died 
in front of a large number of 
witnesses, no trace has been 
found of a weapon of any 
description. Anthony Carp, 
chief of detectives, stated 
that his men had uncovered 
several leads, which they 
were following up, , but he 
could not yet state publicly 
what these leads were. 

Dr. Stein further stated, 
“Throughout the entire ex- 
tent of the wound there were 
traces of tissue paper. We do 
not know how this tissue 
paper got into the wound or 
how it managed to cover 
virtually its entire surface, 
but we do not believe that it 
could have contributed in to 
Mr. Martin’s death.” 

Mr. Martin will be 
cremated at a private cere- 
mony on Friday. He is sur- 
vived by his wife, Margaret, 
47, and two children: Linda, 
12 and Thomas, 9. ★

fifty tons of steel can do, then re- washed the tablets down with water

from an old grimy paper cup. 

“Cold, Captain. You got a cold. 
No one ever found a cure for that.” 

Sol fumbled for a tissue. “I had 
a cold yesterday, Maurice. The 
way 1 feel now it’s got to be 
pneumonia.” 

Isaac Wolfsohn, laser engineer, 
took his eyes from the cupola per- 
iscope. Sol wondered how a boy so 
young could produce a beard so 
thick. It was burgundy and leonine, 
but carefully trimmed. A rare and 
true color, thought Sol. 

“Jeep coming up fast from be- 
hind,” said Wolfsohn. He returned 
to the periscope. “He’s waving. 
Wants us to stop.” 

Sol clutched the shortcom. 
“Lock ’em up, lads. We’ve got 
company.” 

The order was not formally 
phrased, did not need to be. Sol’s 
crews had been with him almost a 
year. They had an unspoken under- 
standing. That, and the fact that 
they had ceased to give a damn 
about too many things, explained 
their efficiency as a fighting unit. 

With a gathering of linked steel 
the squadron halted on the tar- 
chinked highway. Sol climbed wea- 
rily past Wolfsohn, popped the cu- 
pola and ascended into withering 
heat. He rested thinly fleshed fore- 
arms upon the rim of the hatch and 
waited. 

The jeep stopped fifteen paces 
away, just off the concrete. Dust 
drifted menacingly toward Sol’s 
tank. As it arrived, Sol sneezed. 



coughed, then wished he were dead. 

When the pain retreated with the 
dust and the coughing, Soj made 
out a form standing rather stiffly 
by the Centurion’s left skirting 
plate. He rubbed away tears, 
looked again. Sure enough, some- 
one had removed himself from the 
jeep and come forward with the 
dust. 

Sol’s red eyes focused on the 
courier in time to see a crisp salute. 
He returned the salute with one of 
his own, the kind a dead fish would 
make if it were in the army and felt 
as bad as Sol. 

Embryotic warrior, thought Sol, 
fresh out of an academy and still 
ingenuous enough to take orgasmic 
pleasure in being a soldier. 

The embryo’s eyes moved sur- 
reptitiously over Sol’s modified 
uniform, further altered by dirt and 
wear. Sol knew the embryo’s 
thoughts, his uniform correct, neat, 
Sol’s: A mess! A perfect mess! No 
wonder we haven’t won! 

Sol laughed mentally only be- 
cause he did not want to antagonize 
the pain in his skull. If wars were 
won by the best-dressed armies, 
generals would be made in Paris 
boutiques and armies would mince 
rather than march to victory. 

“Sir, you are Captain Inglestien, 
commander of Squadron C, Elev- 
enth armored Regiment, code Ba- 
gel C of Big Bagel?” 

Sol doubted the courier would 
appreciate a humorous answer so 
he contented himself with a nod. 



118 



GALAXY 




Dust coated the made-in-an-acad- 
emy soldier’s face like cheap mas- 
cara. Sweat was making it run. 

“Then, sir, these are your 
orders.” 

Sol received the brown envelope 
with disinterest. The courier al- 
lowed himself a grimace of con- 
tempt, made another curt salute, 
very precise, as if to say, This is 
how it’s done, sir!, and marched 
back to the jeep. The jeep roared, 
pumped gravel and dust. 

Cursing aloud so that his head 
began to smolder, Sol slammed the 
hatch cover before the red dust 
could reach him. 

T he Centurion’s air-condition- 
ing continued to manufacture 
ice cubes malignantly. The out- 
side temperature of one hundred 
plus degrees had begun to clear 
Sol’s head. But now, back inside 
the fifty-ton micro-environment, a 
viscous fluid welled between Sol’s 
temples. 

He kept his voice even as he 
glared at Dunklebloom. “First 
time we stop, Maurice, you fix that 
damn airbox or, by Solomon, I’ll 
rip it out, throw it in front of the 
Jehovah and tread it to iron pulp!” 
“Right, Captain,” answered 
Dunklebloom, grinning lamely. 
“First chance I’ll pop ’er and find 
the bug.” 

“Right, Captain,” answered 
Dunklebloom, grinning lamely. 
“First chance I’ll pop ’er and find 
the bug.” 



Sol opened the brown envelope. 
The orders could only lend detail to 
a general fact already known. 

His voice squawked over the 
shortcom to the eleven Centurions 
drawn up behind the Jehovah: 
“Roll!” 

Early the following morning 
Charlie Bagel Squadron reached a 
river — the river — after veering 
from Highway 81 and dusting a 
mile east over a dirt road recently 
gouged out by engineers. Two ar- 
mored squadrons were . already 
there, along with an uncertain 
amount of ordnance, artillery and 
support auxiliaries. All formed an 
iron tangle along the northern 
bank, waiting to spill across the 
muddy river. 

A traffic MP, trying hard to 
blow the bean out of his whistle, 
waved Sol’s squadron to a parking 
zone of red sand. As the Jehovah 
locked tread, Sol flipped the cupola 
hatch. Clambering through the 
opening, he slid across the olive 
turret cover and dropped to the 
sand. 

“Why the jam?” 

The MP tucked his whistle into a 
pocket, shook sweat from his nose. 
“Guerrillas. Slipped in last night. 
Blew the pontoonie half to 
heaven.” 

“How long before she’s fixed?” 

“Engineers say noon.” The 
trafficker pointed. “See. Got new 
’toons strung to the other shore al- 
ready. Be ready now except they’re 
having tp improvise. Those guerril- 



A VOICE AND BITTER WEEPING 



119 




las did a pretty good job there.” 

The MP darted away as a dozen 
personnel carriers rattled on the 
horizon formed by the northern 
embankment. Sol turned to his 
crew. 

“Spread the word. We’ve got till 
noon. Seems guerrillas put a fly in 
the enginners’ soup last night.” 

Crews spilled from iron wombs. 
Most made for the red water — a 
few sprawled in the long shadows 
of their tanks. 

Like a father, Sol watched his 
crew join others in the sluggish 
river, some whooping and yelling, 
twenty with arms linked in the 
dancing oval of a hora. Each man 
had suffered and had seen his 
dreams broken. Their very world 
had nearly passed into the oblivion 
of radioactive dust. There was 
much they wished to forget. 

There was much Sol wished to 
forget. Members of his family had 
been in the Jewish Legion during 
World War I, serving with Field 
Marshall Allenby and the Zionist 
leader Vlakimir Jabotinsky. His 
grandparents had died in 1938 
when Arabs burned and looted 
Jewish homes in Haifa. Two older 
brothers and an uncle had been lost 
to the El Alamein push of World 
War II. When Israel had become a 
state Sol’s parents had been there 
to rejoice, but not for long — Egyp- 
tian guerrillas had seen to that. At 
age three Sol had found himself 
alone and he had been so ever 
since. In the wars and protracted 



attritions which followed — and of 
these there were many — young Sol 
had had his revenge, again and 
again. War became like a wife, 
sometimes loved, often hated. 

M yra Kalan returned Sol’s 
thoughts to the present. 
“How’s the cold?” Myra’s voice 
was soft, dulcet, hardly the voice of 
a tank commander. Yet Myra and 
her lady crew had taken their 
Blessed Mary into a dozen man- 
created hells. 

“Fine. Dunklebloom performed 
surgery on the air-conditioning. 
That helped. Head’s beginning to 
clear.” 

Myra smiled. Sol looked away, 
feeling empty and alone. Two 
months earlier they had slept to- 
gether. Since then there had been 
little time even for quiet words and 
affection. Myra was a thing of 
beauty in a world which was sys- 
tematically destroying beauty. 
“Why so sad, then?” 

Sol shrugged. “Guess I was born 
frowning.” 

For reasons never clear, Charlie 
Bagel was the first cleared for 
crossing. The Jehovah raked onto 
the unevenness of linked pontoons 
and rattled toward the southern 
bank. The rest of the squadron 
filed behind, spaced so as not to 
overburden the temporary bridge 
with a massing of fifty-ton weights. 
Where the river made a leisurely 
turn a mile to the west, the 81 truss 
bridge lay black in the red water 



120 



GALAXY 




like a collection of broken spiders. 

Sol frowned. If I forget thee, O 
Jerusalem, let my hand forget her 
cunning. 

The land south of the river was 
much the same as that north; red 
earth, sand, scablike vegetation on 
the dry soil, sparse grass, weeds 
brittle with midsummer heat. 
Through the periscope, Sol 
watched the Red River and Okla- 
homa receding, while ahead, the 
plains of Texas opened in arid 
infinities. 

The squadron passed southeast, 
then due south. The terrain 
changed only as the sun fell. As yet 
Charlie Bagel had encountered no 
resistance. In fact, not a living 
Texan had been seen, if the numer- 
ous jackrabbits were discounted. 

Shireet tapped a point on his 
Fina highway map. “Nocona, two 
miles, junction highways eighty- 
two and one-seventy-five. That the 
place?” 

Sol nodded. “We blow their 
-communications, give ’em a scare, 
then ghost south roughly parallel to 
eighty-one.” 

Wolfsohn consulted his badly 
thumbed Backpacker s and Camp- 
er’s Guide to the Southwestern 
States, then a thinner dog-eared 
volume, A Tourist's Guide To 
Texas, copyright 1982. 

The laser engineer clucked in tri- 
umph. “Nocona! Hum.” After a 
moment of study; “Doesn’t say 
much about the place except it’s fa- 
rrtous for its cowboy boots.” 



Charlie Bagel Squadron met its 
first resistance on rolling pasture 
outside the little town famous for 
its boots. Lank cattle fled as artil- 
lery and tanks which were museum 
pieces boomed at the Centurions 
from low hillocks. Sol’s squadron 
fanned, returning fire with their la- 
sers. The battle was one-sided, ab- 
breviated. Tex artillery was bro- 
ken, every tank smashed. Still, Sol 
lost a tank and its crew — a disap- 
pointment. He would miss that 
tank in the future, need it sorely. 
This Texas force had been ill- 
armed militia, a part of the con- 
verted Texas Department of Public 
Safety, now the Public Military 
Defense Force. Farther south 
would be the Retex heavy armored 
units, few in number, but armed 
with modern ordnance. 

The sun cracked like an ocher- 
ous egg on the horizon. Sol’s col- 
umn, minus a Centurion, left No- 
cona with its skeleton crew of 
citizens who were relieved to see 
the Israeli mercenaries on their 
way. 

S OL grinned wryly as he exam- 
ined his new cowboy boots. His 
were simple black, Dunklebloom’s 
a tan, Shireet’s tan, Wolfsohn’s os- 
tentatious red. Back along the 
string of Centurions there were 
other pairs; more black, brown, 
tan, and others white, buff, green, 
red, two-toned, a few unbelievably 
garish. 

That’s my squadron; a mirror to

the world’s madness, thought Sol, 
waxing philosophic now that his 
head had cleared. And little won- 
der. Couldn’t the World War of ’92 
be traced back to fanatics in Eire, 
backed by an eager China? Led by 
one monumental fanatic who had 
believed himself Finn MacCoul re- 
incarnate, they had conquered the 
north, driven out the Protestants 
and eventually threatened Britain 
herself. What Sol never quite un- 
derstood was how this mush- 
roomed into thirty nuclear minutes 
of Sino-Soviet-Anglo-American 
combat followed by a seven-year 
mopping-up operation. 

Sol studied the steel juggernauts 
crawling in the Jehovah's wake of 
brown dust. Originally the squad- 
ron had been composed of Israeli 
mercenaries, their tanks christened 
with names like Wrath of Jehovah 
(Sol’s Centurion), Angel of Death, 
Zion, Aleph, Ben Gurion and 
What’s Sadat? But in the first 
abortive invasion of Texas, nine 
months before, three tanks had 
been lost. As replacements, Sol re- 
ceived new crews, Myra Kalan and 
her female mercenaries among 
them. Regional Oakies composed 
the second crew. The third was 
made up of individuals of little reli- 
gious experience. Respectively, 
they had named their Centurions 
Blessed Mary, Jehovah’s Witness 
and Damnit. 

The War had decimated Amer- 
ica and had taken a terrible toll in 
most other nations involved. It had 



not ended, but simply degenerated 
into more primitive styles as the 
combatants exhausted sophis- 
ticated weapons systems. Nuclear 
weapons had been the first to go in 
a quick flash at the beginning of 
'92. These nuclear bombs, the few 
retained after the falsely reassuring 
disarmament of ’88, had destroyed 
the world’s facilities for producing 
new bombs. The chemical and bio- 
logical attacks that followed did to 
the people what the bombs had 
done to industry. With its mass of 
people all but obliterated, with 
much of its industry broken, Amer- 
ica’s specialized economy col- 
lapsed. The world followed. 

Ten years later few aircraft were 
operable. Even the army had diffi- 
culty replacing weapons as they 
were worn out or destroyed. The 
remaining factories lacked skilled 
scientists and a sufficient labor 
force and were mostly useless. 

Sol’s unit was among the last 
possessing modern tanks. When 
the remaining heavy stuff wore out, 
the battlefields would be given over 
totally to infantry just as, already, 
aircraft had met the dodo’s fate. 

The United States, Russia and 
their allies continued to pursue 
the war with China and India. The 
two factions resembled men who, 
having wounded each other fatally, 
crawled together and thumb-wres- 
tled even as they bled to death. 

Israel had suffered less physi- 
cally than many of her neighbors 
and — along with a few other small

nations not targeted for early anni- 
hilation — to some extent had risen 
to the status of a world power. But 
the war madness which gripped the 
world had reached into her, draw- 
ing her men to Earth’s corners 
where they fought as mercenaries. 

After Texas’ secession from the 
Union, Sol had found employment 
in America, a nation with more 
wars than men. The Lone Star 
State had declared its neutrality. 
The United States Government 
had other ideas, hence the war with 
The Second Republic of Texas. 

A quote came to Sol’s mind, 
Jeremiah 15:31 — or was it 31:15? 
Thus said the Lord: a voice was 
heard in Ramah, lamentations, and 
bitter weeping: Rachel weeping for 
her children refused to be com- 
forted for her children, because 
they were not. 

Who will weep for man when 
man is not? wondered Sol, rubbing 
the hard wedge of his nose. Rachel 
is dead. Who will weep? 

A t dusk, near a town called 
Mallard — a small, round hollow 
dot on the Fina map, Charlie Bagel 
formed a laager around an aban- 
doned barn. In darkness watched 
over by a billion stars and as many 
sad ghosts, crickets sang a dirge. 
Far away a coyote cried the moon 
up out of the east. The men slept 
or took their turn at the watch. 
Sol lay wakeful, thinking of Myra 
sleeping by her tank twenty yards 
aw'ay. Earlier they had talked of 



the War’s end. Of a time when 
they might be together. Of taking 
advantage of the generous land 
grants America offered her mer- 
cenaries. Of marriage. All well- 
intentioned lies. 

Before dawn the column rolled 
south. The sun rose orange and 
bloated in the angle-thickened at- 
mosphere, sent shadows running 
west over undulating plains. 

Thus far an accident of fate had 
kept them from further contact 
with Retex armor. The population, 
upon seeing the American stencil- 
ing on the armor and hand-painted 
stars of David, melted into the 
rubble of their homes. They did not 
care for the Y ank ee- Jewish 
invaders. 

Sol began to wonder if the Tex- 
ans had any intention of resisting 
the invasion. Was it possible that 
Tex strength had been over- 
estimated? Sol was dubious. The 
cowboys, like the U.S. Domestic 
Force, had only limited armor. 
With Texas so big and communica- 
tions so poor it was necessary for 
both sides to maneuver until they 
collided at random like flying 
atoms. Because Charlie Bagel had 
not yet collided was no reason to 
discount the inevitable. 

Shireet spilled words like peb- 
bles. “Old man up ahead.’’ 

Sol pressed his eyes to the com- 
mand periscope. A hundred yards 
ahead an old man ascended a 
grassed elevation topped by a 
splash of sallow-colored trees. 



A VOICE AND BITTER WEEPING 



123 




“Big Bagel’s been too quiet on 
the longcom,” said Sol. “Stop and 
I’ll ask that native if he’s seen 
anything.” 

“Sure thing, Captain.” Shireet 
touched the track steering control 
and veered appropriately. 

Sol’s dry voice went into the 
shortcom. “Short stop, lads. Fifty 
yards.” 

T\\q Jehovah drew up a few yards 
from the man, its Rolls-Royce Me- 
teor idling like a hive of iron bees. 
Sol thrust his head and shoulders 
from the coolness of the Centurion. 

The old man seemed a holdover 
from the Jurassic, dressed in a 
straw hat and overalls five sizes too 
large, like sails empty of wind. His 
skin was wrinkled, brown like a 
persimmon too long in the sun. At 
least a hundred years had siphoned 
him dry of all but a spark of life. 
That spark had taken refuge in his 
eyes, the best place. It meant there 
was still a mind working in the 
mummifying shell. 

“Shalom,” said the ancient, le- 
vering up an arm like a stick and a 
hand like a dry leaf. 

Sol blinked. “You Jewish?” 

“Nope, ain’t nothin’ now, but 
never was a Jew.” He paused, spat 
tobacco from the corner of his 
mouth. “Knew a Jewish fella once, 
though. Owned a dress shop in Sli- 
dell. He alius said, ‘Howdy, Jake,’ 
and I’d alius’ say, ‘Shalom, Phil.’ 
He’s been dead a long time now.” 
The old man nodded toward the 
column of tanks. “Boy, your con- 



traptions shore are givin’ my field 
hell. Don’t them things work on 
the roads?” 

Sol smiled. “Sorry, sir. 1 wasn’t 
aware this field was under 
cultivation.” 

“Ain’t.” 

Sol laughed, a thing he had not 
done lately. “Everyone else ducked 
when they saw us coming. You’re 
not afraid?” 

It was the old man’s turn to be 
amused. “Lord, no. 1 ain’t got no- 
thin’ you fellas ’ud want. Sallie 
May ran off Tuesday with a slick in 
the Highway Patrol Corps. All I 
got left is ma and a few taters and, 
if you’re smart, you’ll run off with 
the taters.” 

Sol tossed the old man two packs 
of tobacco, a form of wealth, fleet- 
ing as it might be. “Keep your po- 
tatoes and your woman, too.” 

The old man cranked himself 
over, picked up the smokings. 
“Shalom, boy. Thank ya.” 

Sol gestured at the surrounding 
terrain. “Seen any Tex armor?” 

The old man made an oblique 
shrug. “Ain’t seen a thing. Been 
fishin’.” He nodded toward a stock 
tank at the bottom of a draw a mile 
away. “Perch and catfish bitin’ 
poorly. Did better yesterday when 
we had a little shower in the morn- 
ing. Perch like to feed when rain 
tickles the pond.” 

Sol nodded. “Good fishing, sir.”

that were bad. The column rolled 
through farmland between Rhome 
and Justin, came finally to the sub- 
urbs of the megapolis of Dalwor- 
thington, with Fort Worth an- 
chored in the west and Dallas in the 
east. A vacant thing, sprawling 
traps for dead dreams, the suburbs 
spread on every quarter. 

The Centurions meshed over as- 
phalt streets not meant to bear the 
weight of juggernauts, tore across 
lawns of rank grass, beat down 
fences and rusting clotheslines. 

“Something coming in,” said 
Dunklebloom. 

Sol took the longcom earphones. 
Big Bagel had bad news for her 
iron children. 

Sol removed the earphones and 
handed them to Dunklebloom. 
“Squadrons north, northwest and 
northeast of Dallas are having it 
rough once they draw within 
twenty or so miles of the city. We 
expected Tex armor, but they’re 
also getting heavy artillery on their 
heads, the sort Intelligence said the 
cowboys lacked. We’re losing a lot 
of tanks, being mauled. Wherever 
the Texans got their artillery — it 
was a neat trick.” 

Dunklebloom blew a breath be- 
tween a gap in his teeth. “If they 
break the main thrust into Dallas 
we’ll be stalled.” 

“Exactly,” snapped Shireet. 
“Those cowboys aren’t dumb.” 

Sol peered at Shireet’s map of 
Dallas. “Well, let’s try to be smart, 
then.” 



In view of the available in- 
telligence, Sol decided the Tex ar- 
tillery must be located somewhere 
on Dallas’ north side, possibly in 
the suburbs of Farmers Branch, 
Richardson or Garland. It might 
be possible then to come upon the 
emplacements from the rear and 
knock them out in a blitz. 

“Remember,” admonished Sol, 
speaking into the shortcom, “sur- 
prise will be our only advantage, so 
keep your eyes open. The ploy 
washes out if we blunder into a de- 
fensive force before we’re within 
range.” 

Moving east into Dallas, the col- 
umn crested a hill of black earth 
and shattered trees. Westward lay 
a vast charcoal radius where de- 
fense industries had once been. 
There, thought Sol, God stubbed 
out his cigarette. But he knew it 
was only an ICBM pock. He had 
seen them in the past, was destined 
to see more. 

The column scrabbled down a 
twenty-degree grade, churned 
across a six-lane avenue, sought 
narrow side streets where there was 
less chance of detection. Grass 
grew yellow in road chinks. The 
Centurions climbed a talus formed 
by a fallen Sears store, then 
spanned a ringent crevice where a 
gas main had burst through the 
pavement. 

In the summer-hot channel of a 
street Charlie Bagel halted. To the 
east and a little north the fortis- 
simo of heavy artillery was plain to

hear, but blocking the view were 
several massive warehouses with 
windows like gouged-out eyes. 

“We’re here,” said Shireet, in- 
dicating the map. “Singleton 
Boulevard. Those guns are about a 
mile away, probably mounted on 
railway cars.” 

The column advanced until the 
thunder of heavy guns shook the 
very streets. The Centurions 
halted. Sol, Dunklebloom, Myra 
and another tank commander 
armed themselves with M25s and 
9mm submachine guns and set out 
to reconnoiter. 

They turned a corner, then an- 
other, advancing with exquisite 
caution. A third turn revealed open 
ground, a levee beyond — the Trin- 
ity Waterway, completed in 1984, 
reaching from Galveston on the 
Gulf to Houston and finally to 
Dalworthington. 

Beyond the earthen levee rose a 
complicated scaffolding. The 
sound of cannon fire came from 
there, together with gouts of smoke 
and fire. 

Dunklebloom gasped in dis- 
belief. 

They zigzagged across the open 
ground, climbed the earthen slope 
to a stone house which afforded 
cover. A ship was anchored in the 
Trinity, a warship. 

“A cruiser,” breathed Myra. 

“The Judge Roy Bean," mut- 
tered Dunklebloom. 

“She’s a heavy cruiser,” said 
Sol. “One of two the cowboys corn-

mandeered at the time of the Seces- 
sion. We’ve found their phantom 
artillery. Those twelve fourteen- 
inch guns have quite a reach.” 

T hey retreated down the em- 
bankment, returned to the wait- 
ing tanks. Sol leaned against the 
Jehovah, breathing hard. He spoke 
quickly as he outlined a plan for 
assaulting the cruiser. 

“There’s a quarter-million dollar 
bounty on the Bean,” Sol finished. 
“We sink her and it's ours.” 
“How’ll we prove we were the 
boys who sank her?” asked an 
Oakie, his mind working like a 
piggy bank. 

Sol laughed sardonically. “They 
can check the markings on the iron 
coffins we leave behind.” 

Crews were swallowed by their 
tanks. The Meteor Mk. 4Bs revved, 
roared. The Centurions crawled 
forward in graceful lurches, one 
hanging back as rear guard. As the 
squadron crossed the open space 
between the buildings and levee, it 
fanned. Two tanks veered south to 
guard a bridge approach, should 
armored units attempt to cross the 
Trinity to lend assistance to the 
Bean. 

Eight tanks labored up the dike’s 
thirty-degree outslope, found the 
crest, then locked track and 
skidded down the concrete inface in 
a shower of steel sparks. Even as 
the squadron slammed to a stop at 
the base of the levee, just a few feet 
from the muddy Trinity, their laser 



cannons opened up on the Bean. 
The cupola-mounted 20mm can- 
non rattled, raked the cruiser’s 
decks, chewing khaki-clad gunners 
racing along the catways. 

The Bean's fourteen-inch guns 
roared angrily, but futilely — none 
could be depressed low enough to 
reach the tanks. But the vessel’s 
lesser guns and laser mounts swiv- 
eled with sickening speed. Black 
wads of macerated earth began to 
rise along the tank-clotted bank. 
Dowels of livid energy laced the 
air. A five-inch shell found the Ben 
Gurion, spread her fifty tons on the 
air like torn paper. A laser finger 
detonated \.\\t Aleph's fuel. Her cu- 
pola, like the top ripped off a beer 
can, rose sixty feet into the air, pin- 
wheeled, fell steaming into the 
deep-dredged Trinity. The Damnit 
erupted in a final curse of flame, 
filled the air with shards of steel. 
Like the inside of a crematorium, 
the Witness blushed red. The Oak-

ies died screaming, but no one 
heard. 

Shrouded in a pall of dense 
smoke, the remaining Centurions 
continued to beam energy into two 
predetermined sections of the 
Bean's hull. Plating began to peel 
like scorched paint, twist and warp 
in an agony of blistering steel. 
Near the aft section the hull opened 
like a bloody gut. 

The Jehovah’s whining laser 
found the aft magazine. The re- 
maining Centurions were lifted al- 
most clear of the earth as the 
cruiser detonated with a sound like 
the slamming of hell’s gates. Lesser 
explosions followed. Then dead- 
ness. Silence. 

The Jehovah limped up the em- 
bankment, slid down the far side, 
paused. Sol hauled himself from 
the tank. Wolfsohn followed. They 
climbed the levee. 

Blowing and steaming like a 
great fish, the Bean lay half-sub- 
merged in the Trinity, her keel rest- 
ing against the muddy bottom. 
Survivors erawled upon the shat- 
tered superstructure like dazed 
ants. 

Wolfsohn slapped Sol’s back. 
“We did it. Captain. We proved 
eight Davids can take on Goliath!” 

Sol gazed at the five burning 
Centurions. The fifth was Myra’s. 
Myra dead. Dark hair and brown 
eyes and beauty in a face and in a 
soul. Gone. 

Sol returned to \.Y\t Jehovah. 

The remains of Charlie Bagel 



Squadron rolled into the canyons 
of downtown Dallas. With fatalis- 
tic cynicism a crew sang the Ha- 
tikva. Several Highway Patrol offi- 
cers tried an ambush with M2s, 
grenades and a 3.5-in. rocket- 
launeher. The launcher was pasted 
to a wall. Sol raked a mall with the 
20mm cannon, killing three of the 
black-clad officers and one naked 
statue. The Centurions rolled on, 
unopposed. Sol remembered the 
old fisherman’s daughter. He won- 
dered if he’d killed Sallie May’s 
fella, wondered if she’d cry if he 
had. 

The Achrit Hayamin has come 
to earth. But the last days would 
not be spent in perfection, at least 
not in the sort of perfection envi- 
sioned by the prophets. Man 
moved rapidly toward perfecting 
himself as a machine of destruc- 
tion. Eventually that perfection 
would be realized when the last two 
men found each others’ throats. 

In an intersection where dead 
signals dangled ludicrously, two 
antiquated Pattons waited like iron 
toads. The J ehovah' s turret rotated 
on its traversing ring. The muzzle 
lost degrees of elevation as Dun- 
klebloom aimed. A Patton blinked 
fire. The Centurions answered with 
knives of lightfire. The blood-lust 
rose in Sol, stronger than sex, 
stronger than love. 

A part of the intersection 
jumped into the air, geysering con- 
crete. Chefzi ba, thought Sol, I 
have all that I desire. ★

NYONE for UFO’s? All of 
the arguments — and almost all 
the material for more arguments 
— are in Cornell University Press’s 
UFO’s — A Scientific Debate. Ed- 
ited by Carl Sagan and Thornton 
Page, it consists primarily of the 
papers submitted to a symposium 
on unidentified flying objects held 
in Boston in December of 1969, 
by the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science. 
Many of the papers have been re- 
vised, expanded and updated for 
the book. There is also a good 
deal of additional material, ap- 
pendices, photographs, charts and 
diagrams, together with a good 
index and bibliographical listing. 
A good, careful, meticulous job, 
full of healthy controversy and 
quite lacking the hysteria and mis- 
led religiosity so often found in 



discussions of the phenomenon. 
For phenomenon it is — not so 
much the UFO, but the “flap” on 
UFO’s as a socio-psychological, 
historical event, which serves, if 
properly used, as a potent and use- 
ful data-bank for the examination 
of our remarkable species. Per- 
haps only in criminology and law 
is there such a mother-lode of 
case-history, testimony and inter- 
pretation as exists in the micro- 
cosm of “UFOlogy,” but the lat- 
ter has the useful character of 
short span and sharp focus — in a 
word, spectacularity. And as a 
psycho-social phenomenon it has 
one more thing: the intrusion of 
the Other, hazy and perniciously 
illogical though it might seem — 
yet it forces us to regard ourselves 
and our works not by standards 
established by our works and our-

selves, but by the Other . some- 
thing different, something outside. 
John Campbell used to challenge 
his writers; “Write me a story 
about a being who thinks as well 
as a man but not like a man.” Few 
writers have succeeded; virtually 
none of the saucerian extremists 
have even come near. The Sagan/ 
Page book is, like Scripture, the 
voice of many different throats, 
and to the attentive reader has no 
single thing to say. Project Blue 
Book was a success, a failure; 
Condon is a saint, a devil; the Air 
Force is above-board — the Air 
Force suppresses, represses, and 
Has Secrets. The contributors to 
the Symposium are without ex- 
ception serious-minded people and 
not stupid, which makes their oc- 
casional, diametrical opposition 
so fascinating. Get this book. If 
you can’t get it for yourself, 
plague your local library to put it 
within your reach. I say again: it 
is not necessary to care about 
UFO’s per se to derive value from 
this book. It is only neeessary to 
care about what people think they 
see, which is only another way of 
caring about what people are. Cor- 
nell University Press, $12.50. 

H ere are a couple of “peripher- 
als” for you. The Enigma of 
Reincarnation, by Brad Steiger 
(Avon, 95(f) is a somewhat less 
than detached presentation of case 
histories and ratiocinations on the 
fascinating subject of having been 
born before. Some of these seem 
to fall rather more into Dr. 
Prince’s “multiple personality” 
territory than into the occult — and 
some of the documentation of 



the ground rules is more a presen- 
tation of what someone said than 
an exercise in reason. Interesting, 
though, on two counts: the sub- 
ject itself, and the fact that so 
many people are devoted to it — 
see the above remarks on UFO's. 
The other recent peripheral comes 
from none other than the tireless 
anthologist Roger Elwood — this 
one is hi's very own book. It’s 
about satanism, witchcraft and 
God, is called Strange Things are 
Happening (Family Library, 95c) 
and is one of that uprush of 
church-oriented books we begin to 
find in supermarket racks next to 
— and confronting — the Gothics 
and the raunchies. No matter what 
your feelings about his basic thrust 
(that “faith in God and His Son” 
is “the only real alternative to 
Satan, his demons, and the 
‘strange things’ of our past and 
present”) you’ll find it an inter- 
esting fast course in the history of 
witchcraft and the occult — and a 
startling glimpse at the new ex- 
plosion of their practices in mod- 
ern life. There’s a compact but ex- 
cellent bibliography, too. 

C ULLING the length and breadth 
of speculative fiction as I do af- 
fords a number of peak moments, 
explosive discoveries. Imagine 
finding for the first time Delany, 
Disch, Lafferty. I can recreate in 
a blink the impact on me of my 
first exposure to D.G. Compton, 
Barry Malzberg and Elizabeth 
Saxton. Well, here’s another one.

bright narrative style and a corus-

future but most specifically deal-

the lowering of entrance require-

spect and responsible concern for 
education per se, throw in a fistful 
of genius for characterization (and 
caricature) and a fine feel for lan- 
guage, and you have a rough idea

S F’S bookish bulldozer Sam 
Moskowitz is at it again. With 
heavy horsepower and a lowered 
blade he has excavated a boxful 
of well-buried gems and presents 
them in Horrors Unknown (Walk- 
er, $5.95). 1 call them gems; Sam 
calls them masterpieces. The 
distinction lies, for example, in the 
appearance here of Ray Brad- 
bury’s very first story, not once 
but twice (the second a rewrite of 
the first with help from Henry 
Hasse). Masterpiece it is not - 
gem it most certainly is, in the 
sense of its being a literary rarity. 
But the book does contain one 
authentic masterpiece: C. L. 

Moore's very early, exquisitely 
written Were-woman, one of the 
most spellbinding tales ever and 
worth the price of the book many 
times over. Warm thanks to the

it was very nearly lost. The book 
also contains a story by (brace 
yourself) C. L. Moore, A. Merritt, 
H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. How-

There are others, notably one by

S EX is here to stay — it’s been in 
and with sf for far longer than 
the superficial surveyors (like 
Kingsley Amis) seem to know. 
But now it flowers and the inevit- 
able has happened: two antholo- 
gies of sf/sx (if 1 may coin a sym- 
bol) — one of them reprints, one, 
originals. I shall beat one of them 
heartily over the head and ears, 
even if it does include one of my 
stories. Strange Bedfellows, ed- 
ited by Thomas Scortia (Random 
House, $5.95) contains some true 
landmarks — like Farmer’s Moth- 
er and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’s 
False Dawn and a long-lost 
Boucher — and a good deal more 
of excellence. My cavil is the edi- 
tor’s arrangement of the stories 
into groups absolutely guaranteed 
to deflate the most skilled auctor- 
ial efforts at structured surprise. 
It should have been enough that 
the book itself is a category (it’s 
even subtitled Sex and Science Fic- 
tion) but Scortia has gone and 
grouped sado-masochism stories, 
homosexual stories, bestiality 
stories, and so on, so that if (as 
is usually the case) the writer tried 
to time his punch or explode his 
revelation, Scortia has seen to it 
that he is defeated. It would have 



been far better if he had extracted 
the two strongest yarns to open 
and close the book and shuffled 
the rest like cards, letting them 
speak for themselves. 1 guess what 
makes me maddest is that most 
of his selections are very good in- 
deed. 

The other one (Eros in Orbit, 
Trident, S6.95) is edited by Jo- 
seph Elder and is quite something 
else. Ed Bryant with an edged and 
hilarious commentary of future 
sex (“They’ve even got a model 
that ejaculates flavored yogurt!’’); 
Gordon Eklund and Thomas Scor- 
tia with potent horrors; Pamela 
Sargent with a finely wrought and 
most tender story about cloning; 
Jon Stopa with what is either a 
comedy or a nightmare; one of 
Barry Malzberg’s sex-ridden, or 
rid-sexing astronauts and others, 
all enjoyable-to-good. The book 
makes a nice package and this is 
the first appearance for all of the 
stories. 

Many times 1 have been asked 
what early reading influenced me 
most. Of the most potent of those 
forces one novel has been out of 
my hands ever since 1 was in high 
school. 1 love that book with an 
abiding passion as a perennial 
evocation of delight and humor 
and beauty. You might imagine 
my pleasure on opening a package 
the other day to find Lord Dun- 
sany’s The Charwoman’s Shadow 
in a handsome paperback from 
Ballantine ($1.25). My warmest 
thanks to the publisher and Lin 
Carter (who did an introducion).

Let us buy the wine! Let us 
drink together ... we will 
drown the sorrow of a thou- 
sand generations! 

Li Po, c. 750 

I STOOD there, looking into the 
night through a slanted trans- 
parent triangle of Mylarform, 
whose center was precisely (though 
coincidentally) at eye-level. My 
eye-level, that is. It was somewhat 
above that of Carole, my wife, who 
stood at my side. 

“What are you going to do?” she 
asked. “Will you tell Winter or will 
you not?” 

“1 don’t know yet. 1 have to 
think.” 

1 looked out into the night, seek- 
ing wisdom, but didn’t find it. Luna 
One is in Mare Imbrium, near Era- 





tosthenes, a crater as familiar to 
me now as Mount Monadnock had 
been on Earth. We’re in the middle 
of the lunar night, though, and I 
can’t see my crater. We’re also in 
the middle of the local night and we 
should be in bed. 

So we stood there looking up at 
Earth. We — Carole and I and The 
Chairman — have a private place on 
the twelfth level of Luna One. Pri- 
vate with solid walls. Not as pri- 
vate as Eli Winter’s, but he is the 
mayor, while I am but his right 
arm. The executive mayor, yes, 
which gives me more than a little 
clout, so we have solid walls and, as 
they say, a view. 

The view was of a crystal-clear 
sky (what else on the moon?), with 
blue-green Earth up there. And she 
looked winsome — the trouble 
didn’t show from here. Earth was 
winsome like a battered old lady, 
wrecked by time and careless use, 
seen through dim lenses from a 
great distance, only the fundamen- 
tal form showing, lacking detail of 
pore and wrinkle. 

The Chairman? Ah, so. The first 
dog on the moon, one of six. He is 
in all effect Our son — or so it 
seems — a smoky-brown Pekingese, 
prideful of the wealth of feathers 
on his paddy feet. If Luna One is to 
be a permanent colony we must 
have our pets. Six dogs and six cats 
have come by rocket-propelled Ark 
to this improbable Ararat — male 
and female pairs of each of six sub- 
species. Of the dogs: Pekingese, 
Lhasa apsos and Cavalier King 
Charles Spaniels — the dogs had to 
be small. Of the cats: short-haired 
tabbies, Siamese and Manx. The 
plural of Manx, if there is one, is 



something I don’t intend to become 
involved with. 

Carole grasped my shoulder, 
turned me to face her, and gave 
me a look I knew too well. 

“You’ll have to, sooner or 
later,” she said. “And shouldn’t it 
be sooner?” 

I turned back to Earth. “I must 
think about it,” I said. 

The smell of this place came to 
me now — artificial, man-made, un- 
natural. Mostly one got used to it, 
like a freshman grows accustomed 
to the anatomy lab at medical 
school, but now and then that ster- 
ilized scent came back afresh, the 
olfactory cortex showing once 
more that it couldn’t be taken in 
forever. The engineers and psy- 
chologists had provided a number 
of essences, including (it was said) 
some obscure pheromones, but you 
still knew you had air-conditioning. 
Nothing here to remind you of the 
smell of a newly mown field of hay. 
Most of the colonists had never 
known that vanishing smell, but I 
had. No scent of Earth here on 
Luna One, right. But Earth being 
what it was— what it had be- 
come — that was not a total loss. 

“You’ve been thinking about it.” 

“Maybe I can take care of it my- 
self. It’s really not that big a deal, 
is it?” 

I’d discovered the first illicit still 
on the moon — the first still on the 
moon, for that matter — and the 
first attempt to grow Cannabis sa- 
liva, and both of these activities 
were altogether prescribed by our 
ground rules. Carole thought the 
still and the Cannabis endangered 
the colony. I knew they were ille- 
gal, but I doubted they were much 



134 



GALAXY 




of a threat. Still, I couldn’t easily 
decide what to do. We, the colony, 
were a prototype, designed to see 
how things might be when we left 
Earth and carried our virtues and 
vices, weaknesses and strengths to 
other places where we might or 
might not survive — assuming arri- 
val in the first place. I thought Car- 
ole was making a foothill out of a 
molehill. But there lies deep within 
me an analog of a Mohorovicic dis- 
continuity and I’m grateful for its 
presence, since it usually tells me 
when things are going too far. 

I touched my wife, looked 
straight into those blue-green eyes 
and said, “1 will think about it — I 
will — but now it is time to go to 
bed.” 

And we did so. As we were go- 
ing to sleep The Chairman heard 
something out there, somewhere 
beneath the dome, and lifted his 
head about an inch and offered a 
tired woof to whatever it was. He 
set a lot of store by face, he did. 

O NE of the obvious stepping 
stones in man’s penetration into 
space, beginning with Mercury, 
Gemini and Apollo, was the es- 
tablishment of a permanent lu- 
nar colony. There being no end to 
the fouling of Earth, we had to go 
someplace. And we weren’t ready 
for the other planets close to home 
(even if they could support us), let 
alone the stars. 

Our penetration of space didn't 
begin with the Mercury pro- 
gram, of course. There were V-2’s 
over London before that, then 
Vikings, Sputniks and other in- 
teresting hardware. A thorough 
reprise, however, would take us 



back to China and rockets in the 
Yuan Dynasty, when a nameless 
(to us) Oriental seeker after 
knowledge combined saltpeter, 
sulfur and charcoal into an in- 
flammatory mix — the propel- 
lant whose energy thrust the first 
fireworks into the sky. 

But that’s stretching things. So, 
in the technological world of 
more or less now we go back to 
Robert Hutchings Goddard, 
standing in the Massachusetts 
snow in 1926, firing up an awk- 
wardly supported apparatus, 
the first liquid-propelled rocket. 
This device ascended some forty- 
one feet in a gentle curve before 
entering its geometrically and 
physically ordained return path 
to the Massachusetts field, into 
which it fell with a no doubt satis- 
factory thunk. And, in due course 
that rocket had led, as one thing 
does to an unpredictable other, 
to the moon. 

The establishment of a rea- 
sonably permanent lunar base 
would be much facilitated, to say 
the least, by the presence of a 
breathable atmosphere, but that 
formidable accomplishment would 
be a long time coming. In the 
meantine, then, back to the dome. 
And — for a permanent colony — 
a dome whose size, construction 
and engineering made the simple 
habitations of the Mayflower mis- 
sions look like children’s toys, 
lying abandoned and forgotten in 
Mare Nectaris and in Tycho — the 
boys and girls having lost interest 
and gone elsewhere to play. 

A dome meant to house 568 peo- 
ple (men, women and children) 
and twelve animals (dogs and cats) 



LUNAONE 



135 




upon the lunar surface posed an 
array of problems of dimen- 
sions the first dome designers, 
those of the Mayflower missions, 
hadn’t had to deal with. There were 
options, however, though only 
two. The first domes on the 
moon — for the early, temporary 
colonies — had been of Mylar- 
plex, the dome prefabricated on 
Earth, carried to the moon and 
there inflated with an oxygen/ni- 
trogen mixture into the approxi- 
mate shape of a hemisphere. 
Those domes had worked, too, but 
in the early missions they had had 
to work for only a few people — 
eleven, for example, in the case of 
ill-starred Mayflower Three, and 
that had been three more than Mis- 
sion Design had called for. 

For the first really serious at- 
tempt to survive indefinitely on 
the moon something larger — and 
by more than an order of magni- 
tude — was required. There were 
two possibilities: an enlarge- 
ment of the prototypical May- 
flower dome, preserving the gen- 
eral concept of those early struc- 
tures, or a geodesic construction, 
a la Fuller, of solid triangular 
sheets of lightweight material, 
which could be transparant, opaque 
or anything between. (A bewilder- 
ing variety of force fields had been 
proposed to obviate the necessity 
for this cumbersome construction, 
but without exception they had re- 
mained on their respective drawing 
boards.) 

In the end the geodesic dome 
had won over the Mayflower 
prototype because the psycholo- 
gists foresaw, accurately or not, 
that the colonists would feel inse- 



cure beneath a very large dome 
constructed of such apparently 
flimsy stuff as Mylarplex. This 
view had been supported by the 
reactions of some of the col- 
onists on the intermediate 
domes between the Mayflowers 
and the first permanent colony, 
Luna One. The psychologists and 
psychiatrists had prevailed over 
the engineers, who were the ones 
who had to erect the structure in 
hostile surroundings. The engi- 
neers had wanted Mylarplex, but 
they had lost. They had lived, how- 
ever, in smaller Mylarplex domes 
while erecting the mammoth geo- 
desic structure, whose form was 
essentially that of a sphere pro- 
jected upon an icosahedron. 

HY five hundred and sixty- 

■ ■ eight people anyway?” 
Frank Mei asked. This was an 
early conference in Houston. 

“Not ours to ask. Ours to build 
the dome.” 

“Within lousy budgetary consid- 
erations. Limitations, I should 
say.” 

These are engineers and archi- 
tects, sitting around a long table. 
They’ve been complaining about 
the budget and other aspects of life. 

“Yes. Okay. Jonas, you’re 
ready?” William (nee Wilhelm) 
von Neiman asked. Von Neiman 
was the chairman of this loosely 
structured body. Jonas Mills was 
liaison between Project Design and 
this group. 

“Right, Bill,” he said. “Gentle- 
men — ah, and ladies — it’s Hke this. 
Luna One is going to start off with 
five hundred and sixty-eight 
people. And twelve small animals. 



136 



GALAXY 




dogs and cats. The population den- 
sity must approach what Project 
Design considers optimal. I don’t 
say be, 1 say approach.” He looked 
owlishly around the table. “The 
density will be greater than that of 
New York City, less than that of 
Calcutta — nearer that of New 
York. For the referent year that 
density in New York was about 
thirteen thousand five hundred 
people per square kilometer. Or 
thirty-five thousand per square 
mile, imperial measure. For Cal- 
cutta, forty-seven thousand five 
hundred per square kilo. A hun- 
dred and twenty-three thousand per 
square mile.” Mills looked up from 
his notes, hoping the figures 
weren’t boring his audience. They 
weren’t. 

“Project Design decrees that the 
population density in the dome of 
Luna One will be twenty thousand 
per square kilometer, plus or minus 
no more than five per cent. That 
would be about fifty thousand per 
square mile. This is people-density. 
To the area required to produce 
this density fifteen per cent is to be 
added for the agricultural fields 
and a total of ten per cent more for 
life support, the recycling plant and 
the like. That is the basic position.” 
. “Ho w did they come up with this 
particular figure — twenty thousand 
per square kilometer?” 

“They didn’t say, but the figure 
is firm. The people-figure is firm, 
that is, within the plus or minus 
five per cent. The additional area, 
for fields and life support and non- 
people needs, is not quite so firm. 
But those are the figures you’re 
supposed to work with.” 

Calculators were drawn from 



pockets around the table. The soft 
tapping of keys was heard, and dig- 
its flashed in brisk animation. 

“I have the figures, gentlemen. 
And ladies.” Mills flushed. The 
others continued to make their own 
calculations. “Five hundred and 
sixty-eight divided by twenty thou- 
sand is point oh two eight four. So 
the floor area of the dome will be, 
people-wise, about a thirty-fifth of 
a square kilometer, or twenty-eight 
thousand six hundred square me- 
ters. Add the other twenty-five per 
cent and it comes to thirty-five 
thousand seven hundred and fifty 
square meters. Three point six hec- 
tares, something under nine acres. 
The floor will be circular. The di- 
ameter works out to about two 
hundred and twelve meters. These 
are rough figures.” 

Some of those at the table 
looked up from their calculators 
with scorn. 

“The circumference is six hun- 
dred and sixty meters. Height at 
center of dome — which is some- 
what flattened from the hemi- 
spherical — is approximately ninety 
meters.” 

Silence for a time, the pocket 
calculators verifying and refining 
these data. 

“That’s a lot of people to put 
into a space like that,” Mei said. 
“Let alone the animals, the pets. 
And the hardware, the life support. 
How about space for recreation? I 
won’t be there, but I don’t think Fd 
like it if I were.” 

“Look outside the windows,” 
Mills said. Knowing what they 
would see, they did so. A yellowish, 
sulfurous mess. “And remember, 
they’ll be building up in the dome. 



LUNAONE 



137 




it won’t all be at ground level.” 

“Ho w high up?” Lucia Lehmann 
asked. 

“The interior of the dome isn’t 
our problem. Another team will be 
handling that. There will be liaison, 
of course. Your only responsibility 
is to build the dome. To answer 
your question, Lucia, they’ll be 
building, inside, all the way to the 
top.” 

“How are they going to get up 
and down?” 

“Ramps and ladders, I think.” 

“Any provision for — well, a 
small park, or like that?” 

“1 don’t know. Provision for 
fields of growing crops, of course. 
That might be sort of the same 
thing.” 

“They know where we’re going 
to put it yet?” 

“Probably in Mare Imbrium. 
Nice flat terrain — and other con- 
siderations I don’t understand.” 

There were other only partly 
relevant questions, but their real 
business was the dome itself and 
they talked about that for some 
time. And they thought of the 
people who would be living there. 

“I find this quite depressing,” 
Mei said as the group left the con- 
ference room. 

“Yes. That’s understandable,” 
said Mills. 

“A honeycomb.” 

“A maze.” 

“A labyrinth.” 

“I’m not so sure,” said Lucia, 
who as a child had played elabo- 
rately with doll houses. “I think it 
might be, you know — cozy.” 

R elative quiet in the dome 
now. There is always a hum and 



a throb in the background, but 
these are omnipresent and cease to 
have meaning as auditory stimuli, 
becoming simply conditions of 
existence. The colonists have 
mostly gone to bed. In the fourth 
level of Sector B, Antonio Scartia, 
thinking his wife asleep, creeps 
from the place they share. In this 
thought about his wife, as fre- 
quently about other such thoughts, 
he is wrong. 

“Where are you going, then?” 
Gina Scartia asks. 

“I have to talk to Charlie.” 

Gina raises her head and passes 
a hand through an abundance of 
tousled black hair. She doesn’t 
know it, doesn’t think about it, but 
she is as beholden to the hair on her 
head as is The Chairman to the 
feathers on his paddy feet. “If 
you’re going to see Maria I kill 
you, all right?” 

“All right, Gina. But I’m 
not — and you know it.” 

She gets out of bed for the mo- 
ment, draws a shapeless garment 
over her shoulders, emphasizing 
the shapeliness beneath. “You are 
up to something, always up to 
something, same as on Earth. I 
don’t know how you made this mis- 
sion. But, as on Earth, I find out 
later what you are up to.” 

She watches her husband leave, 
he flicking aside the curtained par- 
tition to their quarters. “You will 
be back before an hour,” she says 
to his departing back. “Or I hurt 
you, all right?” 

The partition, drawn by lunar 
gravity, fell gently back into place. 

L una one was a honeycomb, a 
maze, a labyrinth, not an easy 



138 



GALAXY 




place to move about in, and eighty 
per cent of the inhabitants knew 
only the parts of the passages that 
had meaning to them. The others 
were more familiar with places that 
were none of their business. And, 
as with ancient cathedrals, history 
and complexity had produced a 
place no one totally knew. 

Antonio Scartia threaded his 
way through a warren of passages, 
ramps and what seemed like tun- 
nels to the quarters of Charles Er- 
skine. Erskine was one of the few 
single men on Luna One. His small 
place was on the second level in 
Sector F, near the periphery, 
though not commanding a view. 
Scartia was a' chemist and Erskine 
was his assistant. 

“1 can’t stay long,” Scartia said. 
“Gina thinks 1 might be otherwise 
occupied. Suspicious girl, but 1 
love her. For all 1 know she’s fol- 
lowed me here.” He peered into the 
dimly illumined passage beyond 
the hanging partition. “So, you’ve 
been putting your head to work? 
What do we do about Operation 
Red, then?” 

“1 know the first thing we’re go- 
ing to do.” 

Charlie’s place had no solid par- 
titions, but he made gestures to 
make the cubicle as secure as he 
could, then unlocked a small closet 
and withdrew a bottle and two 
glasses. Into the glasses he poured 
small quantities of a dark amber 
fluid. He handed one glass to 
Scartia, raised his own, and said, 
“Up!” 

They drank, knocking it down in 
a swallow. There wasn’t much of it. 
“Down!” said Scartia, in ritual re- 
sponse. “So old friend, what now?” 



“Well, we’re not sure he’s onto 
us, are we? Maybe he didn’t 
tumble.” 

“Maybe he didn’t. My guess is 
he did. Something about the look 
in his eyes when he left. The ques- 
tion is, do we keep Red going in the 
lab or do we put it some- 
place — where he can’t find it?” 
Scartia eyed the small amount re- 
maining in the bottle. 

“Might as well finish it,” Charlie 
said. The last drops fell slowly into 
the glasses. They sat at a small 
table, looking at each other, part- 
ners in crime, knowing no guilt 
whatever, thinking only of ways to 
keep their thing going. Scartia 
looked at his watch. 

“We’ve always done it, you 
know,” Charlie said. “Always.” 

Anthony raised a questioning 
glance. 

“Fermented and distilled. It’s 
been part of us back to the cave. 
The fermenting part, anyway. Why 
shouldn’t we do it here? For the 
love of God, do we survive or do we 
not?” Charlie’s face held a serious 
look. “1 say that we do survive. 
And that we should survive 
with — amenity. And that if we do 
so it is — in part at least — because 
of what we do, you and me. In 
these particular operations, that is. 
Their time will come. Project De- 
sign or no. We will provide an im- 
portant service, a necessity. The 
provision of such service will, of 
course, have its reward,” he added 
almost as an afterthought. 

“A necessity, yes, but one over- 
looked by Project Design. This 
makes us crooks, you know. And 
I’m really an honest man at heart.” 

“Well, don’t go too far, Tony. 



LUNAONE 



139 




So you’re an honest man. Think of 
the virtue in providing an honest 
service then. Let’s just say we carry 
on in the tradition of our 
ancestors.” 

“Yes. However, I didn’t come to 
discuss philosophy, but practical 
matters. We will provide a service, 
yes. But I think that Pierre, good 
fellow that he is, is onto us. By ac- 
cident, granted, but it’s still the 
same problem. I say we move the 
operations, both of them. Question 
is, where?” 

“I had come to the same con- 
clusion. Though it makes, of 
course, an inconvenience to us. 
However, in such matters it is best 
to be prudent. I think I know of a 
place in A. Fifth level.” 

“Mario’s?” 

Charlie shook his head. “No. 
Perhaps, for now. I’d best not tell 
you. You understand, friend?” 

“Of course. And I’ll move Yel- 
low, fire that one up in a place I 
know in C. When the heat’s on, 
move on. Old aphorism.” 

“Right on.” 

“What?” 

“An old twentieth-century ex- 
pression. You know I’m a history 
buff.” 

“Okay. I’ve got to get back. I 
don’t like Gina to be mad at me.” 
Hives do hum and Luna One was 
humming, though at this time at a 
subdued level. Activities, licit and 
not, were in progress. The decision 
having been made to move the two 
operating stills into dark quarters 
known only to Scartia and to 
Charlie (and each of these knowing 
only one of those locations), 
Scartia made his way back to his 
enclosure. He took some pride in 



knowing what went on where in 
Luna One, but he passed within ten 
feet of a conversation he knew 
nothing of, one in which he would 
have taken a considerable interest. 



T hree young people, illicit 
agronomists, the first growers of 
marijuana, pot, grass, on the 
moon. These are two boys and a 
girl whose responsibilities involve 
the production of food. C. sativa is 
not a food, but these three have an 
interest in it. On their ride up to 
Luna One they have carried a small 
number of seedlings. Such trans- 
port was, of course, proscribed, but 
they had gotten away with it. 

It is the view of Project Design 
that man will not escape to the 
stars unless he can first establish a 
self-sustaining base on the 
moon — as prelude to a self-sustain- 
ing spacecraft. Self-sustaining. 
This means, among other impera- 
tives, the production of food. Thus 
there are on Luna One a number of 
carefully tended agricultural plots. 
Some are at the skin of the dome, 
where sunlight comes in during the 
lunar day, and some are inside, 
bathed with rays of sophisticated 
content. Some of these plots are 
hydroponic, some are not. The 
three junior agronomists have put 
their smuggled flora in a small plot 
meant for Idaho potatoes, thinking 
no one would notice this small de- 
parture from Plan. But Pierre 
Charpentier, executive mayor, had 
noticed. 

The three horticulturalists are 
Robert and Pamela McDonald and 
Andy Rikishin. They were meeting 
in the McDonald place as Antonio 



140 



GALAXY 




Scartia passed by, almost within 
earshot. 

“I think Carp is ontp us,” Andy 
Rikishin said. Carp’s name was 
Charpentier, but most opted for 
Carp. He was an informal type and 
was reasonably well liked. 
“Though, I think, he tried not to 
show it.” 

“He’s no botanist, no agron- 
omist,” said Pamela. “He’s not 
even a scientist. He’s an adminis- 
trator.” 

“Right. But how much of a sci- 
entist do you have to be to tell the 
difference between marijuana and 
potato plants? And he’s not stu- 
pid,” McDonald said. “The ques- 
tion is, if he’s made our small plot, 
the Idaho potato one, why hasn’t 
he done something about if?” 

Andy extracted a joint from a 
thin metal case in his shirt pocket, 
lit it and passed it around. “I al- 
ways think someone will get the 
smell,” he said. “Good thing this 
fake atmosphere is something we 
can burn the stuff in without blow- 
ing up the dome. I say we sit tight 
and see what happens. We’ve the 
other patch he almost certainly 
doesn’t know about. Okay?” 

“Okay. It would be a bother to 
move it, plus more chance of some- 
body else seeing it.” 

Another decision made, then. 

“What are you thinking about?” 
Rikishin asked, noting Robert’s 
thoughtful gaze. 

“Well, I really wouldn’t want us 
to, you know, louse up the colony 
with our — uh — project. I mean it. 
If I thought it was bad, really bad 
for Luna One, I’d pull up the 
plants. 1 can do without it. You 
know?” 



“Sure,” Rikishin said, not hesi- 
tating. “And so would I. We’re in 
this to survive. But we think 
our — project, good word — en- 
hances our prototypical effort to 
make it, don’t we?” 

They nodded in a silent but not 
totally committed accord and fin- 
ished the joint. Andy made his way, 
then, through tangled passages 
back to his own place, back to 
Sandra and The Mai. The Mai? 
The other Pekingese on the moon. 

Antonio Scartia had arrived at 
his bed about two minutes before 
that. Gina had been only moder- 
ately suspicious and was, he saw 
thankfully, asleep. The end of an- 
other day on Luna One. Day three 
nine one.

D ays into the mission since the 
arrival of the first colonist: 392. 
Deaths to date: one. Jeff Barnes, 
power-plant technician — and, ac- 
cording to present indications, the 
only accident-prone colonist to sift 
through the screenings. In his first 
week on the moon he’d worked on 
an inadequately shielded module in 
the plant with both hands at the 
same time, thus violating safety 
regulations, this particular one go-

tury. He had jerked away in time

equipment without checking the 
life-support of his suit and had run 
out of anything to breathe just out- 
side the lock. Natural selection at 
work on the moon. Barnes prob- 
ably wouldn’t have lasted long in 
the Plymouth Plantation either. 

Births: two. A boy to one couple 
and a girl to another, which tended 
to maintain a balance. Peter 
Mungo and Ishbel Lopez y Gasset 
were the first children born in the 
first permanent colony on the 
moon. There had been two other 
births on other, more transitory lu- 
nar missions. 

Population: 569, up one from 
Day One. 

Why only two births in 392 days? 
Actually there should have been 
but one, since the desideratum was 
zero population growth. Not only 
was there no hurry to over- 
populate — their situation being 
what it was, their memories of 
Earth being what they were — but 
overpopulation was specifieally de- 
fined, proscribed and under con- 
trol. The members of the commu- 
nity had been chosen with this in 
mind. Which is to say that they 
were supposed to be relatively long 
on contraception and short on 
compulsion to beget. 

One extra birth had, though, 
slipped in. Or out, if you will. The 
Mungo boy was strictly legitimate, 
having been conceived with full of- 
ficial approval about three weeks 
after Jeff Barnes had made his an- 
oxic departure from Luna One. 

The Lopez y Gasset girl was also 
legitimate, though only aeeiden- 
tally so. The p-c pill was almost 
perfect, but not quite. In any case, 
Desiree Lopez y Gasset had con- 



vinced the council that she had in- 
deed taken the pill and that it, well, 
hadn’t worked. This had been 
known to happen on Earth, so why 
not here? 

Day three nine two. 

«¥»THAT now?” Carole asked. 

W “I need to take a walk,” 1 
said. “I’m claustrophobic, though I 
was well sereened for that. As were 
we all. I’ve things on my mind.” 

Carole propped herself on her el- 
bows to look at me. She was cute. 
“So walk here,” she said. “See the 
view. How many of us have one? 
Enjoy. I’ll be quiet. Or go up to the 
Penthouse. Or let’s both go to the 
Penthouse.” 

“With all due respeet,” I said, 
“being quiet is not your major vir- 
tue. Though virtues you have.” I 
trod the short space, thinking that 
Earth gravity would be more suit- 
able for this kind of pacing — you 
could put more into it. Triangle af- 
ter triangle floated past my periph- 
eral vision. 1 turned and they slid 
by on the other side. There were 
small imperfections in each pane of 
Mylarform and I knew them all. 
One was like a great white pine, I 
thought, though Carole couldn’t 
see it. I hadn’t seen a real one for a 
long time. “And I don’t feel like 
going to the Penthouse just now. 
I’d have to check the list anyway 
and it’s in my office.” 

I stopped walking for a minute 
and sat on the edge of the bed. The 
Chairman came out from under 
and gave me the look that says its 
time to saek out. 

“I’m going to look around to- 
morrow and see how things are. 
Then I’ll talk to Winter,” I said. 



142 



GALAXY 




I rose from the bed. Pace, pace. 
The Chairman down under again. 
Passes to leave the dome to walk, 
however briefly, on the surface 
were stringently rationed. Not that 
I needed a pass. There wasn’t much 
to do out there, not now, and it cost 
a bunch of energy every time some- 
one went out. It was surprising how 
the need (for some) to get out there 
became so urgent now and then. It 
seemed a little closer to Earth and I 
understood that, but none of us 
wanted to go back there — and even 
if we wanted to we knew we never 
could. 

“I don’t know why you’re so 
psyched up about it,” Carole said. 
“You’ve discovered forbidden op- 
erations and you must stop them. 
The colony won’t survive without 
discipline, right? I’ve heard you say 
that so many times. Remember 
Mayflower Three?” 

“I remember Mayflower Three 
as well as anyone,” I said, “though 
it was before my time. But I think 
this is something different.” 

“Different how? And why 
haven’t you talked to me more 
about it?” 

“I haven’t talked to you more 
about it because it’s just happened. 
The point is this — and I do remem- 
ber Mayflower Three — we’re leav- 
ing Earth because it is, more or 
less, a ruin. A ruin made by us. One 
of the things that put it where it is 
was drug abuse.” Carole opened 
her lovely mouth, but I shut her 
off. “One of the things,” 1 said. 
“Not drugs, but drug abuse. I don’t 
propose to give you a learned dis- 
course on the history of fermenta- 
tion, distillation, tobacco, mush- 
rooms, heroin — ” 



Here Carole cast her eyes aloft, 
all the way to the ceiling of our 
small place. The ceiling was low. 
For me there is a comfort in low- 
ceilinged places, except when I’m 
claustrophobic. When I was a child 
1 dreamed much of such places, 
pleasant dreams. It must have been 
tied up with a return to the womb, 
so the psychologists had said when 
I was being screened for Luna One. 
Well, why not? It was safe and 
quiet there. And low-ceilinged. 

“What I’m really thinking 
about,” I said, “is maybe here is an 
opportunity to work with the drug 
thing on a different basis. We cer- 
tainly blew it there,” I said, nod- 
ding toward the familiar blue-green 
disk. “Maybe we could do it better. 
Find a different way, a new ap- 
proach, something.” 

Carole thought about that. “I 
see something of your point, I 
guess. But the law is the law, isn’t 
it? And you’re the number-two 
man here. Must be you’ve got to be 
on the side of the rules, Pete.” 

I looked into the blue-green eyes 
I knew so well. Something here was 
out of joint, but 1 couldn’t put my 
finger on it. “You’re coming on 
strong on the side of law and order, 
aren’t you?” 

The blue-green eyes looked away 
as 1 crawled into bed. 

“I know you’re troubled,” she 
said. “You’ll do what’s right. I 
know.” 

I was almost asleep. Uncon- 
scious resolution. Or attempts in 
that direction. “The law is the law 
is Project Design is Project De- 
sign,” 1 heard myself saying. I 
thought that was silly, knocked it 
off and snuggled against Carole,

seeking wisdom and comfort. 
Comfort I found. 

N ext morning, still in the lunar 
night, I went to Winter’s office. 
This was on a high level, the third 
from the top, occupying half of 
that space. The view was some- 
thing, but I wasn’t there for that. 
Anyway it was night and I couldn’t 
see Eratosthenes. It took some get- 
ting used to — its being dark all day 
for two weeks, then light all night. 

Winter sat behind his desk, look- 
ing like a displaced secretary of 
state: dolichocephalic of skull, 
bushy white of mustache and old 
Boston Brahmin of mien. His name 
was Winter and that suited his 
smile. He was another of the few 
single men on the moon. His wife 
and only daughter had been killed 
in a rocket crash two weeks before 
the liftoff they were supposed to 
ride with Winter on. 

I told him straight off what I had 
found and what I hadn’t done 
about it. He took it coolly. 

“Actually,” he said, “I’m not 
much surprised. These activities 
are, of course, against our law, 
against Project Design, and will 
have to be terminated. Have you 
gotten onto John Edgar yet?” 

“No, I haven’t.” 

John Edgar was our law enforce- 
ment officer. John Edgar wasn’t his 
name, though, he was called that 
after a twentieth-century bureau- 
crat whose name someone had 
remembered. 

“Why not, then?” 

I was not at ease. “It’s a long 
story,” I said, buying a few mo- 
ments, wondering what I was 
doing. “The thing is, Eli, I’m not 



sure what is the right thing to do.” 

We were a small colony and we 
all more or less knew each other. I 
could see that Winter was trying to 
understand something in me he 
hadn’t known was there. He was a 
little off balance. 

“Carp,” he said. “Carp. I don’t 
have to tell you this, but it is pos- 
sible that the future of our race, for 
what it’s worth, depends on what 
happens in Luna One. Our laws, di- 
rectives, were well thought out, 
well planned. For what possible 
reason would you think of violating 
them?” 

“I’ll come to that. But, Eli, the 
laws weren’t made by us, were 
they? They were made by Project 
Design on Earth. None of whose 
personnel became part of Luna 
One. Not one. They’re there, all of 
them. We’re here. Maybe we 
should make our own laws. We’re 
alone and almost autonomous. 
How many more supply ships are 
coming? Three? Then radio contact 
only, through which we tell them 
how to make a self-sufficient col- 
ony work while they’re building the 
ships, assembling them in orbit, to 
head for our nearest neighbors. 
Presumably we — our descendants, 
that is, if the colony survives — will 
be shuttled to the ships and away 
we go, the ships carrying other self- 
sustaining colonies constructed 
upon what we have learned here.” I 
paused. “Excuse the lecture. 1 got 
off my point.” 

“Which was,’’ Winter said, 
“how you could consider per- 
mitting these illicit operations to 
continue. I’m not about to send 
you Earthside on the next supply 
ship, but you’ve aroused my inter- 



144 



GALAXY 




est. My interest, not my approval.” 
“To make it short, it’s simply 
that this is something -we’ve always 
done — back to prehistory. That 
must mean something. Ferment- 
ing, distilling, smoking.” 

“But not mainlining heroin.” 
“That’s something else. That’s not 
what we’re dealing with.” 

“What we’re dealing with is the 
beginning of that. In one 
word — why do we have to leave 
Earth?” 

“In one word, pollution.” 
“That’s right. Carp. But pollu- 
tion is an omnibus condition. One 
of the reasons we’re here is because 
of escalating internal pollution, if 
you will, through ubiquitous use of 
psychoaclive drugs on Earth. 
What’s keeping much of Earth 
quiet right now, Carp, except a 
combination of Jesus and junk? We 
want to do better up here.” 

“We do. No argument. But — a 
small drink now and then? A quiet 
smoke?” 

Winter looked at me thought- 
fully. “The history of that Earth 
out there,” he said, nodding, “is 
what has put us here, in uncomfort- 
able and hostile surroundings, 
trying to escape. Don’t think 
Project Design didn’t think out a 
few things. Carp. They did.” 

He rose and walked a little. I sat 
there looking at the stars. 

“They have to go. Carp, the stills 
and the grass. You want John Ed- 
gar? Want me to come with you?” 
“No,” I said, standing up. “No. 
I’ll take care of it. I’ll be back to 
you in due course.” I turned to 
leave, then turned back again. “If 
we pull up the plants,” I said, 
“they’re gone. We can’t synthesize 



the plants. They can’t. So they 
might try putting something else 
together. Acid, maybe. And there 
will always be something to fer- 
ment, to distill, as long as we grow 
wheat, potatoes, rice, whatever. 
Unless we can eliminate yeast from 
Luna One — and we’re a little late 
for that. I’m just wondering if 
we’re not conducting an exercise in 
futility.” 

“Luna One is a warren, as you 
know. Carp, but it’s not that big. 
We can keep an eye on all the labs. 
We could put John Edgar on it full 
time, there hasn’t been much else 
by way of crime here.” His tone in- 
dicated that the interview was over. 
“You know what you have to do.” 

1 nodded and left. 

I WENT down to the fourth level 
and headed toward the center of 
the dome. Antonio Scartia’s lab 
didn’t need skin space and he was 
deep inside. His shop was strictly 
analytic — or had been until he’d 
fired up the still I’d spotted by acci- 
dent. Scartia was a chemist. His 
primary function was to analyze lu- 
nar soil and the products produced 
from it. Vitamins in the cabbage, 
trace elements in the potatoes, like 
that. He wasn’t supposed to be a 
creative scientist, just a fact-finding 
one. 1 rapped on the jamb of his 
portal and walked in. A spacious 
laboratory, considering where it 
was. 

“Scartia,” 1 said. “Good morn- 
ing. I’m just wandering around. 
Part of my job, eh? Any problems? 
Everything going well?” 

“Good morning. Carp. I mean, 
Mr. Charrp — that is — ” 

“Carp is fine, just fine. Any 



LUNA ONE 



145 




problems here?” I walked slowly 
along the aisle between the two 
long benches filled with arcane ap- 
paratus. The apparatus I sought 
wasn’t there. 

“No, Carp. No problems. All 
going well.” Bubbling retorts, 
strange odors and no still. 
“This — ” Scartia indicated a com- 
plex array of glassware — “is a new 
analysis of the major nutrient in 
the new hydroponic bay. Here are 
the first results if you’re inte''- 
ested.” 

I glanced courteously at the 
sheet he proffered and understood 
some of it. “They seem to be going 
well, the hydroponic projects.” 

“They are. Everybody knows 
where the water comes from, but it 
makes good vegetables.” We 
walked back the way we had come, 
looking now at the gear on the 
other bench. Scartia was wary, but 
unruffled. He had moved the still, 
so he had guessed or suspected that 
I was onto him. 

“What happened to the appa- 
ratus that was here the other day?” 
I said, placing my finger on a pre- 
cise spot on the table. “It looked 
interesting.” 

“Here?” he said, looking at the 
spot mystified, as if trying to re- 
member. He did it well. 

“Here. It looked like a distilling 
column, Scartia — adapted to moon 
conditions, but recognizable.” 

His swarthy features assumed a 
look of such spurious innocence 
that I almost laughed, but I played 
it straight. This was serious busi- 
ness. “No distilling operations are 
in our program here, sir,” he said, 
looking like a Renaissance angel. 
Or trying to. 



“I could have sworn,” said I. 
“Right here. A glass flask, a reflux 
column, a water-cooled condenser. 
A collecting vessel. Surely I didn’t 
dream it.” 

“That piece of apparatus you 
must have dreamed, sir. Carp. 
Never anything like that here.” 
“Perhaps an assistant moved it 
to a different place?” 

“No, sir. Carp. I only have one 
assistant, that’s Erskine — Charlie 
— and I know everything he does. 
It all has to be in the log.” He 
proceeded to a disorderly desk. 
“See,” he said, passing me a thick 
notebook. 

I gave it a pro forma glance. 
“And everything you do must be 
recorded here also, of course.” 
“Certainly, sir. Carp.” 

“Yes. Perhaps I imagined that 
apparatus. Or maybe it was in 
some other place. Perhaps I’ll find 
it, eh?” 

There was an understanding in 
our mutual appraisal. He knew 
that I knew and he knew that I 
knew that he knew. But it was a 
small world and we were treating 
each other like gentlemen. Which 
we both, after all, were. 

Scartia was eager for me to be 
gone, but I had things on my mind. 
“You’re an analytic chemist, 
right?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Can you give me a few 
minutes? I’ve a few questions. On 
unrelated matters.” 

“Sure, Carp.” He was wary 
again. “Why don’t we sit down 
right over here?” He led me to his 
untidy desk. 

“Okay, Tony. Tell me this. Can 
marijuana be synthesized? And 



146 



GALAXY 




keep it simple — I’m no chemist.” 

A look of genuine and refreshing 
innocence now came to Scartia’s 
face, together with relief. Pot, 
clearly, was something he wasn’t 
into. 

“Well, Carp, yes and no. First of 
all, there’s no such one simple thing 
as marijuana. What’s in the grass is 
a very complex mixture. The major 
component, THC — that’s tetra- 
hydrocannibanol — can be synthe- 
sized. But it’s a long and tedious 
process. Why do you want to know 
about that?” 

“I’m curious. And I’m interested 
in chemistry — also in Luna One. In 
other words — among our various 
worries here we don’t have to think 
about some ambitious chemist — 
not you, of course — synthesizing 
grass?” 

“No, sir. No problem. Carp. 
The way to do it would be to grow 
the plants — ” Sudden comprehen- 
sion illumined his dark face and he 
let the sentence trail off. 

“Fine. 1 won’t worry about that, 
then. All right, how about acid? 
Could it be synthesized here on 
Luna One?” 

Scartia was enjoying this. “Well 
again, yes and no. If you have D- 
lysergic acid to start with, there’s 
no problem. But to make the D- 
lysergic acid is one hell of a job — 
sir. 1 don’t think anybody could get 
away with it in any lab in this 
dome, Carp, if that’s what you’re 
worried about.” 

“1 didn’t say I’m worried — 1 said 
I’m curious. Is there any way to 
make acid without synthesizing D- 
lysergic acid?” 

“Well, yes. You’d need ergot. 
The best way would be to grow 



rye — which we don’t have any of 
on Luna One that 1 know 
about — and infect it with Claviceps 
purpurea. That’s an ergot fungus. 
This grows on the rye. Then you 
isolate the dried sclerotia of the er- 
got, extract the alkaloids and you 
can get D-lysergic acid out of that 
without too much trouble.” 

“1 said to keep it simple, Tony. 
So — if 1 understand you, we 
couldn’t have an acid problem on 
Luna One unless we had both rye 
and an infective fungus. Right?” 
“That’s right. Carp. Again no 
real problem. I’d say.” Scartia, il- 
licit distiller that I knew him to be, 
was sitting in on a high-level con- 
ference here and 1 could see that it 
pleased him. Also, it was obvious 
to him that 1 had other problems 
than his still (stills?) on my 
mind — and that was clearly a 
comfort. 

“You seem very knowledgeable 
about all this, Tony.” 

“Well, yes. I’m a chemist. A 
good one. There was lots of com- 
petition to get up here, Carp.” 
“Right. Okay. Last question. 
Flow about skag? Heroin? Can that 
be synthesized?” 

“Yes, sir, it can. But it is a very, 
very long and difficult procedure. 
No way to do it here. No way. An- 
other worry off your mind, sir?” 
“Yes. But there’s an easier way 
to make heroin.” 

“There is. Grow the poppies. 
Pap aver somniferum. That gives 
you the raw opium and it’s easy to 
make heroin from that. But there’s 
not much room here to grow that 
many poppies.” 

1 rose. “Thank you, Tony,” 1 
said. My informant got up hastily. 



LUNAONE

“I’ve got to look for a still now,” I 
said at the jamb. 

“Sure, Carp. If there is one I 
hope you find it.” 

I walked out. I hadn’t solved 
anything, but I’d put a card on the 
table. 

N ext I drifted through many a 
walkway, past many rooms, 
nearly weightless down a number 
of ladders, to a place on ground 
level at the outer wall — the field 
watched over by Robert McDonald 
and Andy Rikishin. Idaho po- 
tatoes, Kansas wheat and Iowa 
corn. This plot wasn’t much by way 
of being international, but we had 
the best of those products and that 
was that. 

Rikishin greeted me. “Hi, 
Carp,” he said, not long on cere- 
mony. Likable boy, I thought. We 
knew each other socially to a de- 
gree. The Rikishins had the only 
other Pekingese on Luna One. 
McDonald was off at the other end 
of the plot, measuring different 
plant heights in different sub-plots. 

“Just wandering around,” I said. 
“Part of my job. How are things 
going? Any problems here, Andy?” 
“No problems, not really. We 
could use more phosphates, but we 
understand the difficulty there. But 
we’re just about on target. Carp.” 

I strolled about in this airy place 
where green things grew. It was the 
lunar night, but it was our day and 
overhead lamps of sophisticated 
design shed complex frequencies of 
radiation upon the plants and the 
soil. And upon us, of course. I 
wasn’t quite used to the idea of 
green things growing on the moon. 
It was beguiling to walk around. 



“Idaho potatoes,” 1 said at the 
appropriate place. They ought to 
do well here. The volcanic soil.” 
Always, on Earth, the best po- 
tatoes had come from Idaho, grow- 
ing not far from the so-called Cra- 
ters of the Moon, in soil not 
dissimilar to this. 1 suddenly saw 
Eratosthenes, my moon crater, not 
as the Mount Monadnock I’d be- 
come familiar with later, but as 
some kind of inverse kin to the 
Great Southern Butte in Idaho 
which, in my boyhood, I had 
known from almost daily observa- 
tion. I had looked out at it from my 
bedroom window and from the 
windows of the physics lab in high 
school, when I should have been at- 
tending to the work at hand. 

“We’ve got a good crop coming 
here. Carp,” he said, somewhat 
uneasily now, following my gaze. 
“You’re right about the soil. Noth- 
ing like volcanic soil for potatoes.” 

“And how about the Cannabis 
saliva?” 1 asked casually. “Does it 
do well?” 

Rikishin sighed, but he didn’t 
flap. “We thought you were on to 
us. Carp,” he said. “We tried to 
hide the plants behind the potatoes. 
They do stand out, though, come to 
think of it. Don’t look like potatoes 
at all, do they?” 

“They do not,” I said. In a small 
world a quarter of a million of 
miles from a bad place and light- 
years from anything else reason- 
able, you treat each other 
like — well, people — or you don’t 
survive. So I thought. 

McDonald had walked up, got- 
ten the picture. We nodded to each 
other. There wasn’t one person on 
Luna One I didn’t know. Every- 



148 



GALAXY 




body didn’t know everybody else, 
but I did. And everybody knew me, 
too. Not my fault, just that I was 
the executive mayor. 

“Has John Edgar been around 
much?” I asked. 

“He’s walked through, but he 
didn’t make the pot,” Rikishin 
said. 

“Do I have to say these plants 
aren’t supposed to be here?” 

“No, Carp. We know that. We 
thought it was worth a try. What 
are you going to do with them?” 

I looked at these young boys. “1 
can’t leave them growing, can I?” 
“You can if nobody knows about 
it,” McDonald said hastily. 

“Luna One is no game, boys, as 
you know. I’ve already mentioned 
the plants to Mayor Winter. I’ll 
have to take them,” I said. “You 
can understand that.’ ’ 

“I suppose so,” Rikishin said. 
“But think of this — the concept of 
irrevocability. If the plants are de- 
stroyed there’s no way we can get 
any more. No way. We can’t syn- 
thesize the plants, right?” he said. 
“But it doesn’t take much of a lab 
to synthesize acid. Not that I’m for 
that. I’m not. But it wouldn’t be 
too difficult to do. Luna One does 
have chemical laboratories.” 

Time now to display my newly 
acquired knowledge. “Actually,” I 
said, “it would be an extremely la- 
borious undertaking to synthesize 
LSD unless you had D-lysergic 
acid to start with. And I don’t 
think there’s any of that on Luna 
One.” I told them about the rye 
and the ergot. 

“Oh. All right. Leastways we’re 
not growing poppies,” McDonald 
said. 



They wrapped the plants care- 
fully for me, gave them to me and I 
took them away. 

I respected these boys and their 
enterprise. Not this specific enter- 
prise, but their enterprise gener- 
ally. Perhaps they respected me, I 
didn’t know. I had tried not to 
show that I’d seen two or three 
other plants hidden behind the 
Iowa corn. If they respected me 
they’d think I’d seen those other 
plants. If I’d seen them and hadn’t 
taken them, then what would they 
think? I was mildly apologetic at 
leaving them with what I recog- 
nized as a minor dilemma. But I 
couldn’t think too much about 
their problems, having quite 
enough of my own to deal with. In 
the end, with Rikishin’s concept of 
irrevocability in mind, I took that 
one bundle of plants to Winter’s of- 
fice and left them on his desk. I rec- 
ognized that I was playing some 
kind of small-time God here and 
wondered if I was cut out for it.

“No, I didn’t. It isn’t right.”

The dogs and cats on the moon 
had adapted to lunar gravity with- 
out difficulty. Mai Ling now paced 
sensuously about the room, her 
hairy tail waving in a slow dignity 
it could never have achieved on 
Earth. She sniffed at the canopy 
guarding the entrance, threw her- 
self on the floor in front of Andy, 
presenting her stomach to be 
stroked. Andy did so. “It’s not me 
she wants,” he said. “She wants 
The Chairman. Poor thing. You 
should have kept her on the pill, 
damn it. She’ll whine and talk and 
howl all night. And tomorrow and 
tomorrow.” 

“It isn’t right,” Sandra said. Her 
figure was more than ample. She 
took her turn walking round the 
small place, her walk as sensuous 
as that of the hapless guardian of 
the wall against the heathen devil. 
“I take the pill, too, a different 
one, granted, but a pill. I don’t 
want to, but I know the rules and I 
do it. For now I do it.” Andy 
glanced at her sharply. “The Mai 
does not know the rules, so it isn’t 
fair.” 

Sandra said this as if she had, 
without really thinking about it, 
just discovered how to square the 
circle. Her maiden name had been 
Lee. She was Chinese, the Sandra 
notwithstanding. 

“But — you know the rules, as 
you admit, and the rules are to give 
the dogs the pills. For at least two 
more months. Then we can peti- 



tion.” Andy realized that his stance 
reeked of paradox and con- 
tradiction, but he didn’t know any- 
thing to do about it. “This is 
Project Design,” he added lamely. 

Sandra said where Project De- 
sign could put it and Andy had 
cause to doubt the gentility of his 
wife’s breeding, though her ped- 
igree went back almost as far as 
did Mai Ling’s. Or The Chair- 
man’s, for that matter. 

“It is late,” she said. “It is time 
for bed. I will fix you a hot 
chocolate.” 

“That would be nice,” Andy 
said, idly stroking Mai Ling. “I’m 
glad the cacao grows well in the 
hydroponics.” 

Sandra was a good helpmeet. 
She made hot chocolate for her 
tired young husband and into this 
sweet mix, which Andy adored, she 
thoughtfully added enough nonatal 
to stone an ox. 

There are two sexes and one 
knows more than the other. 

«nOWN, boy,” 1 said. The 

^Chairman was sniffing 
around near the door to our place, 
trying to mount my left leg from 
time to time and, failing that, try- 
ing the table leg. “What’s the mat- 
ter with this dog?” 

“He’s nervous, that’s all,” Car- 
ole said. “He didn’t eat much of his 
dinner tonight. It’s late. Leave him 
alone and let’s go to sleep. I’ll fix 
you a nice hot cup of tea, all right? 
With lots of sugar, the way you like 
it. We’re way ahead of our ration.” 

“That would be nice,” I said. 
“The bitches on this trip are all 
fixed on the pill so it couldn’t be 
that. Where’s The Chairman get- 



150

ting all of these raunchy ideas?” 
“He’s nervous,” Carole said and 
went into the cubby to fix my tea. 

“I do like a cup of hot tea before 
bed,” I said. “A proper hot toddy 
would be better, but — ” 

“You left the plants with Win- 
ter?” she asked from the cubby. 

“I did. I don’t want to talk about 
it now.” 

Carole brought me a steaming 
cup. 1 think I was asleep before my 
head hit the pillow. I had a frag- 
mented dream or perhaps just a 
hypnagogic flight of fancy before 
dropping off. Carole held my hand 
and said something about how ev- 
erything would be all right and she 
would be right back, just as soon as 
she took The Chairman for a little 
walk.

1 WENT looking for John Edgar. 

That’s what you do on Luna 
One when you want to see some- 
one; you go looking. There were no 
telephones — Project Design had 
thought such expenditure frivolous. 
There was a thin network of emer- 
gency links between the mayor’s 
office, my office, the power plant, 
the electronics bay and so on. We 
could talk to Earth with some ease, 
but not to the guy around the cor- 
ner on the next level. A sensible ar- 
rangement, one most people liked. 



Whatever our problems were we 
didn’t have to be on the phone the 
livelong day. 

I found John Edgar playing gin 
rummy with a technician in the 
power plant and led him through 
the passages to my office on the 
sixth level, at the skin. 

“John Edgar,” I said. “We have 
a small problem.” 

He sat in the chair across from 
me on the other side of the desk. 
He was paunchy and bald, a short 
man. 

“Nothing serious, I hope?” 

“Not really. I found some mari- 
juana growing in Field K.” 

John Edgar raised his shaggy 
brows. “That’s a serious violation, 
sir. Field K. Rikishin and 
McDonald?” 

“Yes. I pulled up the plants and 
disposed of them. Turned them in 
to Winter, that is.” 

“Case closed?” 

“Maybe. I want you to look 
around the fields and the hydro- 
ponic bays, see if there’s more. 
Know what it looks like?” 

“Sir!” He was offended, perhaps 
doubly so since I’d made the dis- 
covery in his field, as it were. 

“Of course you do. Sorry, John 
Edgar. Look around, confiscate 
anything you find and take it to 
Winter. Don’t make a big thing of 
it. We don’t want word to get 
around for a number of reasons.” 
“Right, Carp. Will do. If this 
has gotten much of a start they 
could be growing it in their rooms, 
right?” 

“Not easily. And you can’t go 
into private places without good 
cause plus an order from the mayor 
or me. Few people live at the skin. 



LUNA ONE 



151 




They might use sunlamps, of 
course.” 

“The only lamps like that in the 
colony I know anything about are 
the big ones in the fields and the 
hydroponics. One of those would 
attract attention in private quar- 
ters. And probably would show up 
on the power-plant tape.” 

‘‘Right. Well, John Edgar, look 
around, casual like, check it out, 
and let me know if you find 
anything.” 

“Will do.” 

He left then and I got into my 
next conference, which was with 
myself. I wondered why 1 hadn’t 
told John Edgar to check Field K 
with particular care, instead of giv- 
ing the impression I’d entirely 
taken care of that particular prob- 
lem. What, 1 wondered, was 1 
doing with, to or for Rikishin and 
McDonald? Giving them a sporting 
chance to keep their small opera- 
tion going? It would have to be 
small. And why hadn’t I mentioned 
the disappearing still? No doubt for 
the same reason I’d told Winter I’d 
been mistaken about the still, that 
it had been a different apparatus 
altogether. And where had that still 
been hidden, I wondered. Ques- 
tions in my mind. You don’t need 
sunlamps or skin space to run a 
still. You need raw materials, but 
in a colony of this size a modest 
amount of wheat or corn could eas- 
ily enough be liberated. Was I with 
Scartia and Erskine or against 
them? If one still were operating se- 
cretly, perhaps there were others. 
Did we have on Luna One a revival 
of the Mafia? I knew from my 
study of history that that organiza- 
tion was thought to have died out 



in the late twentieth century. I also 
knew that it had been a powerful 
force from time to time. Perhaps it 
had only been driven underground. 
Was I up against a few individ- 
ualists or a service organization? 

The problems I had here would 
be difficult to solve, assuming that 
I wanted to solve them, because we 
had rules, directives about privacy, 
and they were meant to be en- 
forced. We lived so close together it 
had to be that way. 

Most of the partitions, except for 
the structurally functional ones, 
were not solid — they were hanging 
drapes, as on an ancient pleasure 
barge. This gave some visual pri- 
vacy, though in the auditory area 
there were problems. The height of 
the dome at the center was some 
ninety meters, and the honeycomb 
within rose all the way to the top, 
following the upward sweeping 
curve from the perimeter of the 
base. Because of fear of claustro- 
phobia (which ought to be called 
claustrophobiaphobia), about 
which Project Design had had 
some cause to be thoughtful, the 
height of each level averaged about 
ten feet. Because of structural con- 
siderations I didn’t understand, 
some levels (such as ours, the 
twelfth) were lower-ceilinged and 
some were higher. An average 
height of ten feet was somewhat ex- 
travagant, but the social scientists 
had prevailed. In the end there 
were, then, twenty-four levels. At 
the periphery, at the skin of the 
dome, there was less upward exten- 
sion, of course, but at the center of 
the dome the top level was number 
twenty-four. The Penthouse. 

Elevators could have been pro- 



152 



GALAXY 




vided, but would have represented 
an unconscionable expense. Any- 
way, climbing and descending all 
those ladders and ramps in moon 
gravity was dandy exercise, some- 
thing between jungle-gym and 
trampoline. 

I sat alone in my office, in con- 
ference with myself, thinking about 
privacy and other things. Our need 
for privacy would impede John Ed- 
gar’s search for marijuana plants 
and also any effort I might make to 
discover stills making alcohol. 
There was no way anyone could 
have too much privacy on Luna 
One — or enough of it — but the aim 
of Project Design had been to 
create at least the illusion of it. 
Thus the heavy hangings which 
served as walls, partitions, where 
structurally important support 
wasn’t necessary. These made for a 
vague reminiscence of potentates’ 
tents pitched near quiet oases. And 
the hanging before the door was, 
barring extreme cause, inviolate. 
You knock on the flimsy jamb or 
stand there and announce yourself. 
Entrance is granted or it is not. 
And when it isn’t no offense is 
taken. 

I could, of course, check the 
fields and laboratories with no dif- 
ficulty. But 1 didn’t think I’d find 
much action there, not now. 

I put a piece of paper into my 
typewriter and wrote this: 

Luna One, Day 394. 

I have two problems. Pot is 
being grown on Luna One and al- 
cohol is being distilled. / have ter- 
minated one pot plantation and 
have let one go. / have permitted a 
still to go underground. My query 
to me: how far do / pursue these 



enterprises? / am second in com- 
mand here and my hand is not 
empty. My dreams, however, are 
uneasy. 

From the extensively unpub- 
lished works of Pierre Charpentier, 
day 395 moving toward day 396. 

I tore it up and threw it in the 
wastebasket. 

N OW day 401, the sun three days 
up. See Sandra Rikishin and 
Carole Charpentier. They have 
connived to increase the Pekingese 
population of Luna One, not hav- 
ing thought even to ask for ap- 
proval in the certain knowledge 
that no approval was available. 
And they, united in this unlawful 
venture, have united also in a 
greater sin. Eor sin, read violation 
of Project Design. Pierre, Pete, 
Carp, executive mayor, is off about 
his troubled business and the girls 
bask near the skin in the Charpen- 
tier quartier. 

“I did it,” Sandra Rikishin says. 
“I mean.^ I didn’t do it. I really, 
honest to God, didn’t.” 

Sandra has not brought The Mai 
along. The Chairman lies there, as 
close to the skin as he can get, seek- 
ing what there is of the rising sun, 
thinking he must be, this day, a 
pussycat. He entertains little 
thought of The Mai, that is all be- 
hind, though one must believe that 
his recent memories, though fleet- 
ing, are not without satisfaction. 
He studies the feathers on his 
paddy feet. 

The post-coital pill is what 
Sandra is talking about. She has 
cohabited and she has not taken the 
pill. She looks now at Carole and 
there is an understanding here. 



LUNAONE

chauvinism aside, that can only be 
inter-female. They are partners in 
sin and their sin is of no mean di- 
mension. They have let The Mai 
and The Chairman have their way 
and that has been their undoing. 
They have witnessed this Oriental 
joining, have observed the motions, 
the looks in the eyes. In con- 
sequence they have, both of them, 
done considerable violence to 
Project Design. They touch each 
others hands for a moment. 

“We’re in it together,” Carole 
said. “I refuse to believe it’s bad 
for the mission. For Luna One. 
And so do you.” 

The Chairman turned his head 
their way for a moment, wondered 
if there was something worth com- 
menting on, decided not, and re- 
turned to his pleasurable musings. 

“It may not be bad for the mis- 
sion, Carole, but it might be bad 
for us,” Sandra said. She hadn't 
been slender to start with and now 
she was, overnight, a garden of 
plums. Overnight. Such is the way 
of a gravid woman. Inevitablility 
is, so to say, inescapable. Carole, 
for her part, was beyond all recall a 
grove of ripe apricots. 

“This was how it had to be.” 

“Yes.” 

Many are the faces of love. It 
has been difficult for a man to love 
a man, but it has been possible. It 
has been said that the truest love is 
that between a father and his son, a 
mother and her daughter. Perhaps 
that is so. Women love women 
more easily than men love men. 
Though they have a greater prob- 
lem in giving physical expression to 
such emotion — witness, say, any 
male athletic team in the arena at 



the moment of victory. Forgetting 
about sex (a likely story) the young 
can love the old and the old the 
young. All of which is peripherally 
to the point of Carole Charpentier 
and Sandra Rikishin. They, in their 
various lovings, have sinned — and, 
in the view of Project Design, have 
sinned grievously. And see 
this — they feel no guilt, none at all. 
Fear, yes. But guilt is not their 
problem. 

“We had to do it,” Sandra says. 
Carole nods and they touch their 
hands together fleetingly once 
more. “I’ve got to go.” 

“Yes. Pete will be back soon.” 
They had been drinking tea. 
They looked through the Mylar- 
plex into the abrasive landscape. 

“We did have to,” Carole says. 
“We did. You know.” 

They understand each other and 
that is the end of the exchange. 
Carp and Andy, engaged in other 
inquiries and operations, know 
very little of what is going on with 
their women — though they love 
them very much.

Horace, 6508 B.C. 

L una one, day 491. The sun 
high, two days past lunar noon. 
No Cannabis sativa grew in any 
agricultural plot or hydroponic 
bay, not that I knew of. I had un- 
covered no still. A small amount of 
grass could be in almost anyone’s 
private place, if they could get it 
into the right radiation often

enough. I was sure at least one still 
was going someplace and wondered 
why Scartia, fallen Renaissance 
angel that he was, hadn’t come 
round with a clandestine drink for 
me. I knew that he knew that I 
knew. John Edgar, in an excess of 
enthusiastic search, had almost 
blundered his way back to Earth on 
the next to the last supply ship, but 
Winter and I had decided to keep 
him on. Call it nostalgia. 

And I still worried about heroin 
and acid and wondered — was 1 
missing something? If tender little 
marijuana plants could be (had 
been) brought up, smuggled, to 
Luna One, why not raw opium? 
Why not poppies? Raw opium was 
no real problem — that would make 
one batch of heroin and that would 
be the end of it. But poppies could 
be forever. 

And if our artistes had the skill 
to produce alcohol (brandy? 
vodka? applejack? what were 
they up to?) then perhaps others 
leaning toward public service had 
brought up small amounts of rye 
and Claviceps purpurea and gotten 
into acid. 

“Why do you worry so much 
about it?” Carole asked, we about 
to go to sleep. “Whatever they’re 
up to they can’t do much of it. 
What’s the harm?” 

I cast my wife a questioning 
look. “Not long ago 1 was thinking 
these problems didn’t amount to 
much and you were saying they had 
to be stopped. Now it seems to be 
the other way around. Are you put- 
ting on weight?” 

“Not enough to worry about,” 
she said. “But we’re talking about 
your worry. Why are you thinking 



all the time about these 
things — when whatever it might be 
that someone is up to must be on 
such a small scale that it isn’t much 
of a problem?” 

“You may be right as far as 
Luna One goes, sweetheart. My 
trouble is, I look ahead.” 

“I don’t get it.” 

“What’s the point of Luna One? 
Why are we here, herded together 
like turtles in bottles, in consid- 
erable discomfort?” 

“I don't feel uncomfortable at 
all at the moment, if you want to 
know,” she said, displaying herself 
outrageously on the bed next to the 
skin. “But, yes, things could be 
more comfortable elsewhere. All 
right. We’re here because Earth is 
a mess. Though she do look pretty 
from here.” We looked. The air- 
conditioning worked, but because 
of the heat and glare we had cov- 
ered most of our skin space with 
movable hangings. We could still 
see Earth through the bright slit. 
“Doesn’t she?” 

“She do. But she is a ruin and 
we’ve all got to leave the general 
area before too long. And wherever 
man does survive, if he does, it 
won’t be on the moon. It will be on 
a reasonably Earth-type planet. 
Upon which we will^’erect, among 
other facilities, laboratories. Upon 
which place, if not eliminated here, 
could be grown pot and poppies.” 

“And things to make alcohol 
from.” 

“That’s a different thing alto- 
gether. Wherever we have potatoes 
or grapes or corn or anything like 
that we’ll have alcohol. But when 
we take off for our first new 
planet — we could leave the mari- 



LUNAONE 



155 




juana and poppies behind. Those 
problems solved.” 

“So why wouldn’t someone syn- 
thesize the drugs without the 
plants?” 

“Too difficult a process.” 
“Marijuana and poppies might 
be growing in abundance on our 
landfall, of course.” 

“They might be, but it’s most 
unlikely.” 

“It’s not much of a job to put 
acid together, is it?” 

“It is if you don’t have the pre- 
cursor. We could set up the plan so 
there wouldn’t be any rye or Clavi- 
ceps purpurea. " 

“But if it’s an Earth-type planet 
something will be there. In some 
form or other. You’re trying to 
sweep back the tide, Pete.” 

“It seems that way to me now 
and then.” 

“I’ll make us a cup of tea,” she 
said. And she did. “None of this 
has anything to do with you, with 
us,” she said. “We’ll be out of it 
long before.” 

“I know. But if we can have a 
child, he or she might be on the first 
ship. We have to think of their 
world. I do hope we get the ap- 
proval for that. Tm the exec, after 
all.” 

Carole looked at me in a way 1 
didn.t understand, but I liked it. 
“We’ll have a child,” she said con- 
fidently. “But I think you’re taking 
a too-regimented view of things.” 
“I’m thinking of starting a new 
world someplace and making it 
better. 1 won’t be there to start 
it — nor will you — but I’m thinking 
about those who will. Our grand- 
children — or maybe beyond them, 
even.” 



“You’re not saying that mari- 
juana and acid ruined Earth?” 

“They were and are part of the 
picture that did.” 

“And alcohol?” 

“There’s always alcohol. Always 
has been and that didn’t tear down 
the planet. Anyway, that will al- 
ways be there.” 

“Tobacco?” 

“That’s all right for people who 
want to cut down their life 
expectancy.” 

“Herion does that, too, but that 
isn’t all right?” 

I was getting the worse of this 
and didn’t know why. I copped out. 
“It’s time for bed,” I said, pulling 
the shade all the way across. 

“I think you’re being simple- 
minded.” 

“You are putting on weight,” I 
said, just before dropping off to 
sleep. “It feels nice.” 

A nd the next morning I set off 
on my appointed rounds. I vis- 
ited Rikishin and McDonald first. 
There hadn’t been anything amiss 
there for months, but it didn’t seem 
a bad idea to check it out, to begin 
there, where I’d found the pot in 
the first place. 

“Hi, Carp,” Rikishin said. 
“Nice crop of beets coming here.” 
He was innocence itself. 

I looked around. “Lots of nice 
crops,” I said. “Doing very well.” 
This was, 1 thought, something like 
walking through a field of growing 
things on Earth. “Any Cannabis 
hidden away here or there?” I 
asked. 

Rikishin wasn’t offended. “You 
know you took all those plants,” he 
said pleasantly. Nice boy.

“How’s The Mai?” 

“Why — just fine. And The 
Chairman?” 

“He was nervous a while back, 
but he seems better now. We ought 
to get them together some time. 
Soon as we get the authorization, 
of course, and The Mai is in the 
mood.” 

“That’s right, Carp. That is so 
right.” 

I looked around some more after 
that and found nothing of interest. 
The colony hummed along, folks 
went about their designated tasks, 
the atomic power plant worked, 
our wastes were recycled and we 
lived. I dropped by our place and 
saw that Carole was deep into 
something with Sandra Rikishin. 
Andy was, I knew, busy tending his 
field and crops. So I exercised a 
prerogative and violated the sanc- 
tity of the Rikishin place. In this I 
was responding, I saw later, to sub- 
liminal clues. 

The Mai was there, all right. She 
came padding up to me with plea- 
sure and recognition because she 
did know me and she brought along 
with her two brown puppies, one of 
which immediately began to lick 
my hand. Then the other one 
wanted to play and my Mohorovi- 
cic discontinuity informed me that 
1 was in trouble up to my incudes, 
mallei and stapes. Those are the 
bones in my middle ears. And in 
yours. 

So I played with the puppies. 
They were beguiling and seemed 
happy with lunar gravity. Most 
puppies I’d known had been happy 
with Earth gravity, but these were 
the first to be born on the moon. I 
complimented The Mai upon her 



qualities of motherhood. I knew 
who was the father of those pup- 
pies. My dog. As in instant replay 
of something not seen the first time 
the picture formed in my mind. I 
played with the puppies a little bit 
more and got out of there. 

I had, I saw, been had. The exec- 
utive mayor, yes. There are two 
sexes and one will have its way. I 
went to the upper levels and 
climbed the last ladder to the Pent- 
house to think about this, but it 
didn’t help. My sweet wife Carole, 
Sandra Rikishin and The Mai had 
had their way. I saw The Chairman 
as but a willing accomplice. Acces- 
sory during and after the fact, but 
victimized along with me. I didn’t 
say anything to anyone about it un- 
til eleven o’clock that night. Local 
time. 

“The Mai,” I said to Carole, 
“has two puppies. Pekingeses. 
About a month old.” 

“But that’s not — ” 

“No, it’s not possible, is it? Very 
cute puppies, 1 must say.” 

“I wonder — ” 

“Knock it off, sweetheart. I 
don’t wonder at all, nor do you. 
You and Sandra laid it on. She 
didn’t give The Mai the pill and 
you took The Chairman down 
there about three months ago. I re- 
member it as in a dream. Though I 
didn’t understand it at the.time.” 
The Chairman, at the mention of 
his name, stuck his head out from 
beneath the bed, then considered 
this conversation beneath his inter- 
est and went back. 

Carole had been listening to 
Bach. She now turned off the tape. 
“All right, we did it. The puppies 
are sweet, aren’t they?”

“They are. But where does this 
put me? Where does this put Luna 
One, for that matter? We have to 
follow the rules.” 

“You don’t always do so, do 
you? Why did they send two of 
each up? Two of each of the pets?” 
“You know as well as 1. Or as 
Noah. To reproduce.” 

“Then—” 

“To reproduce in due course. 
When Project Design says so. 
When the parents are older. To re- 
duce the overpopulation prob — ” 
“I know. I do. But it’s wrong. 
And it’s bad genetically. Moth- 
ers — bitches or people — should 
conceive before they’re too old.” 

I couldn’t deal with that for the 
moment, so we went back to Bach. 




morning. “Come on.” 



“Come where?” 

“To Winter’s office. We’ll pick 
up Sandra on the way.” 

“Damn it,” 1 said as the puppies 
greeted me in the Rikishin place. 
“They are cute. I wish you hadn’t 
done this,” I said to both girls. 

We left the puppies with The 
Mai and 1 took the girls to Win- 
ter’s office. 

“I’m please to see you,” he said 
to Sandra and Carole and in- 
dicated where they should sit. 1 
walked back and forth. “I don’t 
suppose this is a social visit?” 

“It is not,” I said. “We have a 
problem.” Winter remained silent, 
looking at me thoughtfully. “The 
fact is that The Mai — that’s the 
Rikishin’s Pekingese — has two 
puppies. About a month old. 1 hap- 
pened to find out about them yes- 



terday.” Sandra gave me a 
reproachful look. 

“Pekingese puppies?” 

“All the way.” 

“Then the — what do you call it 
in a dog? — father, sire, must, of 
course, be The Chairman.” 

“That’s right,” I said. Winter 
had neither dog nor cat — no wife or 
child. His attitude toward the pets 
on Luna One was, as far as I knew, 
more or less neutral. 

“And it means,” Winter said, 
“that the — ah — Mai was not given 
her pill.” He looked at Sandra. 
“By accident, or by design. That 
pill hasn’t failed yet.” 

“No point in not admitting it,” 
Sandra said. “Carole and I cooked 
it up. The pill isn’t natural.” She 
blushed. 

“So you rewrote the regulations 
as you saw fit?” 

I had to hand it to the girls. They 
didn’t seem to feel guilty at all. 
More defiant than anything. 

“Something will have to be done 
about this,” Winter said. “I’ll have 
to call a meeting of the council 
right away.” 

The council was a group of five 
colonists — governing body, judge, 
and jury in one. Its function was to 
deal with the more serious in- 
fractions of Project Design. It 
hadn’t been convened in the pot 
and alcohol business because both 
Winter and I wanted to keep that 
as quiet as possible. In addition to 
Winter and me, the members were: 
Joe Collins, M.D., Luna One’s 
first and only physician — he had 
had veterinary training as well — 
Linda Wellman, who on Earth 
had been a social worker, and 
Chin Wang, chief scientist .

W INTER, making some con- 
cession, suggested that one of 
the puppies be destroyed and I 
regretted having brought the mat- 
ter to his attention. Winter, Well- 
man and Wang supported this pro- 
posal. Joe Collins was against it 
and I abstained. I was afflicted by 
the importance of discipline, but 1 
couldn’t vote to do away with one 
of the puppies. Also, I knew what 
execution of the sentence would do 
to both Sandra and Carole. 

“You’ll take care of it, Joe?’’ 
Winter asked. 

“Yes. But I won’t enjoy it.’’ 
Meeting over. 

I walked with Collins to the 
Rikishin place. Bad scene. Sandra 
was supposed to pick out the one 
she was allowed to keep. There was 
one of each sex. She couldn’t do it. 
I picked up one of the puppies, put 
it into the arms of Collins and we 
moved swiftly away. 1 walked with 
Collins to his office/laboratory. 

We were silent, threading our 
way through the maze to his work 
place on the second level, near the 
center. Collins, our one physician, 
1 thought, walking and climbing 
along behind him. We age and we 
die. When we lose our physician 
where is the next one to come 
from? Not from Earth. Collins is 
training a younger man, appren- 
tice-style, who will take over in due 
course. Luna One has a medical li- 
brary, an operating place and a 
laboratory. Plus one apprentice, 
Clif Manescu, and that will have to 
do. 

We came to the dispensary and 
closed the door — our doctor rated 
solid partitions. Collins put down 
th^ puppy. “This is the male.” The 



unnamed (as far as I knew) male 
padded over and licked my hand. 

“We can’t do this, Joe,” I said. 

“I don’t like it any more than 
you. I was, you noticed, the only 
one who voted against the 
proposal.” 

“I know. 1 didn’t abstain lightly. 
1 want you to violate the council’s 
directive, Joe. Many more people 
wanted to bring pets up here than 
could. We can find this fellow a se- 
cret home, right?” I remembered 
telling Carole that puppies couldn’t 
be kept secret. 

“1 know a young couple that 
would go out of their minds to have 
him,’’ Collins said. “But why 
should we do that? Why should I? 
Project Design, via council, says I 
do away with this creature. Be- 
sides, he’d probably be discov- 
ered.” 

The creature wagged its devel- 
oping tail and went over to Collins. 

“I’ll tell you why,” 1 said and I 
told him about the Riki- 
shin/McDonald pot caper. “1 pro- 
pose a trade-off. I’ll tell the Riki- 
shins that we'll try to keep this 
puppy in the colony if Andy will 
pull up the rest of the marijuana. 
I’m sure they’ve got it growing 
someplace. I can’t find it. They’ll 
do it, so’s not to do in the puppy. 
All right?” 

“1 don’t want to do in this boy 
any more than you do,” Collins 
said. “But in the end the rules, 
laws, directives are important, 
aren’t they?” 

“They are. But here’s a chance 
to trade one violation for another. 
Project Design comes out even. 
You want, with your own hand, to 
put this pup away and have the pot 



LUNAONE

grow — or the other way around, 
man?” 

“You think one offense is worse 
than the other?” He rubbed the 
puppy’s pink stomach. 

“I most certainly do.” 

“You don’t mind at all playing 
God, sort of, do you?” 

I’d thought of that. “In these 
small ways I don’t, 1 guess. What 
say, Joe?” 

He abandoned the puppy for the 
moment and gave me a long hard 
look. “You don’t have to twist my 
arm. Carp. I’m on your side. I’ll do 
it. Not just for the trade-off ei- 
ther — though, professionally. I’d 
have to be against the Cannabis. 
All of this puts us in quite a spot. 
We’ve been up here almost five 
hundred days now. And I haven’t 
violated a directive yet. Though 
I’ve had ample opportunity. Now 
I’m an accessory after the fact. 
Some cheap imitation God’s 
younger brother — no offense.” 

“I know, I know.” 

“The thing is,” Collins said, 
“people can be told only so far 
what to do. Even when it gets down 
to the bare bones of survival every- 
one won’t be told what to do all the 
lime. They’ll burn their joint on the 
gallows, jump off the plank with 
their puppy.” 

“Thank you much, Joe. You’re a 
gentleman and a scholar. I’ll go 
talk to the Rikishins.” 

“Best this doesn’t become com- 
mon knowledge, exactly.” 

“Goes without saying. There’s 
room for many a secret in a hive 
like this.” 

I N THE Rikishin place Sandra 
was sitting on the bed, red of 



eye, while Andy walked the floor. 

“Carp,” Andy said without 
enthusiasm. 

The Mai and the puppy lay in the 
corner, knowing everything was 
wrong. 

“I’ve a deal to put to you,” I 
said. “Have you named the 
puppies?” 

“What difference does that 
make?” 

“Look, damn it. I said I have a 
deal for you. Have you named the 
puppies?” 

“Yes,” Sandra said. “This is 
Ling Ling. The other one is Shau. 
Means Little Shadow.” 

I lowered my voice. The dogs, 
sensing something in progress, 
came to the middle of the floor. 
“This must go no further,” I said. 
They nodded, some kind of desper- 
ate hope in Sandra’s eyes. “Joe 
Collins and 1 are prepared to try to 
smuggle Shau into a cozy home.” 

Sandra was, suddenly, the most 
beautiful girl on Luna One. 

“But there’s a price,” I said 
softly but quickly. 

“Anything.” Sandra. 

“What?” Andy. 

“Okay, Andy. You remember 
when I found the Cannabis behind 
tlje Idaho potatoes?” 

“Sure.” 

“All right. I saw the other bunch 
at the same time. Behind the Iowa 
corn. Don’t ask me why 1 let 
you — uh — transplant it. I don’t 
know. The deal is this. Doc Collins 
and I put Shau into a happy 
home — we just have to hope we can 
make it stick — and you, Andy, de- 
stroy every marijuana plant on 
Luna One you know about. All 
right?”

GALAXY 




Sandra was flipping daggers 
Andy’s way, but it wasn’t neces- 
sary. He remained gently unflap- 
pable, touched his hand to 
Sandra’s knee. “Why, sure. Carp. 
Sure. That’s a bargain — and a 
good one, too. 1 didn’t favor the 
grass too much anyway. Want me 
to bring the plants to you? There 
aren’t many of them.” 

“Just pull them up, Andy. Re- 
cycle them into Idaho potatoes. I 
don’t need to see them.” I made to 
leave. 

“Will we know who has Shau,” 
Sandra asked, “so we can — ” 
“Sure. But nobody else. No- 
body. Right?” 

I made to leave again and 
Sandra touched the dogs, got up 
and kissed me fully and sweetly on 
my surprised mouth. 

1 MADE my way slowly through 
narrow passages which 1 now 
thought of as dry runnels, to the 
twelfth level. Home. Being a minor 
deity, I thought, is not altogether 
without compensation. I told Car- 
ole what I, with Collins, had done. 
And she overwhelmed me, she did. 
I can’t say I put up any resistance. 

« WHY did Carp do it?” Sandra 
W Rikishin asked Andy. 

“You overwhelm me,” Andy 
said. 

“That’s nice, but not to the 
point. Why did Carp do what he 
did?” 

Andy thought this over for some 
time, though Sandra was dis- 
tracting him. “How can I say?” he 
finally asked. “He likes Peking- 
eses, obviously, and cats and other 
dogs, but I don’t think that’s it. He 



wants Luna One to survive. And he 
has his own ideas how it must do 
so.” 

“Bless him,” Sandra said. 

They played with the dogs and 
went to sleep.

Li Po 

L ittle otto wasn’t little any 
more, but everyone still called 
him that. He was a short-haired 
domestic tabby and his knowledge 
of Luna One exceeded that of any 
human. He was mostly gray, with 
white on his paws and parts of his 
face — he was handsome and, 
watching his demeanor, one had to 
think he was aware of this. His ad- 
aptation to lunar gravity made it 
seem that cats had been designed 
for it in the first place. If the pas- 
sage was long enough, Little Otto 
simply flew down it, touching the 
floor but fleetingly, now and then. 
There were two other male cats on 
Luna One, but they had learned not 
to tangle with Little Otto. There 
were three female cats, and Little 
Otto made his rounds frequently, 
forever checking things out, 
evaluating. 

Thus, when the Milfords, on the 
eighth level, after considerable dis- 
cussion, decided not to give Prin- 
cess (their short-haired domestic 
tabby) her pill. Little Otto was the 
first to know. The sounds of that 



LUNAONE

night must have penetrated fifty 
yards in all directions, through all 
the hangings and partitions, the 
two cats at the center of a sphere of 
intoxicating cacophony, but no one 
seemed to mind. It quieted down in 
the end and no report reached Win- 
ter’s desk, nor did John Edgar hear 
of it. Nor did Pierre Charpentier. 

Little Otto found his way back 
to his own place as if he controlled 
and owned Luna One lock, stock 
and barrel. Which, from his point 
of view, he did. He leaped upon the 
bed of his so-called owners (the 
McKays, level nine) and kneaded 
so forcibly and purred so loudly he 
woke them both. 

“Good boy, Otto,’’ Kenneth 
McKay said sleepily. “Damn cat 
has got me started,” he said, turn- 
ing toward his sleepy wife. 

D ay 545 — and I had a disturbing 
night for reasons that were still 
in my unconscious when 1 put my 
head on my pillow. Shau was doing 
fine, his presence not brought to of- 
ficial attention, not that I knew of. 
As far as I knew pot had been elim- 
inated from Luna One. I trusted 
Andy Rikishin. Yet my sleep that 
night was filled with edgy dreams. 

I dreamed that Andy had 
double-crossed me, that the entire 
colony had gone junkie and there 
was no chance whatever to survive 
on the moon, let alone go to the 
stars. I dreamed that there were so 
many dogs you couldn’t walk the 
corridors or climb the stairs with- 
out being made filthy — as in New 
York before the Canine Code. I 
dreamed there were so many babies 
a man couldn’t get a good night’s 
sleep. Tomcats added to the din in 



that one. And I dreamed I couldn’t 
sleep. This can happen in dreams, 
though you must be asleep to 
dream it, which seems a paradox of 
some kind. I couldn’t sleep and 
thought to seek comfort by resting 
my head for a time on the plump 
cushion of Carole’s stomach. I did 
so and heard her heart beat and 
this was comforting. I dreamed 
then that I was almost going to 
sleep. 

But stay! Carole was sleeping 
easily, but her heart was going 
about a hundred and twenty times 
a minute. She's sick, I thought, 
something is wrong. But I knew 
Carole had great reserves of some 
kind of Amazonian strength and 
never got sick. So in my dream I 
figured it out — what 1 heard wasn’t 
Carole’s heart at all. She was preg- 
nant and I was listening to my — 
son? Daughter? I knew a fierce 
pride for some moments, then real- 
ized that something was indeed 
wrong. Very wrong. 

Then Carole gave birth to a child 
(a lovely girl, lovely) and Winter 
and the council met to decide what 
must be done. I had no vote. The 
sentence was for Carole to suit up 
and carry the defenseless child out 
upon the lunar surface. 

I awoke shaking and leaped 
from bed, knowing the world was 
over. I walked back and forth 
within that small space and gradu- 
ally disentangled dream from 
reality. 

“What is it, Pete?” 

“I had a bad dream. It’s all right 
now.” 

Carole raised her head. “It’s still 
about the puppy, isn’t it?” 

I said I guessed so and Carole 



162 



GALAXY 




comforted me. A man needs com- 
fort at a time like that. 

She snored gently not long after 
and I felt myself dropping off. My 
girl’s stomach is a pillow, 1 
thought, and 1 scrounged about 
and got my head on it. 

And there it was. V.\xhdup, lub- 
dup, \nhdup ... a hundred and 
twenty times a minute, give or take 
five. 

1 DIDN’T tell Carole next day 
that I had discovered that 1 was 
a father. Would it be going too far 
to say that I was distracted, pre- 
occupied, anxious and consumed 
with a sense of imminent doom? 1 
would have to add that I’d wanted 
to, well, be a father for what now 
seemed a long, long time. 1 needed 
a psychiatrist, no doubt about it, 
but Project Design, in their not-so- 
infinite wisdom, had thought that 
rigorous earthside screening would 
leave room on Luna One for some 
more essential person. I thought 
about consulting my fellow coun- 
cilperson, Linda Wellman, but 
abandoned that. The hell with it. 
The fruits of the Earthside screen- 
ing included, so far: unauthorized 
production of alcohol; unautho- 
rized growing of marijuana (this 
now, presumably, terminated); two 
unauthorized Pekingese puppies, 
one of whom continued to maintain 
a secret existence — and that had to 
be with the active connivance of 
more than the few people 1 knew 
were involved — and now at least 
one unauthorized human preg- 
nancy, in respect of which 1 was ac- 
cessory after the fact, as long as 1 
knew about it and didn’t say any- 
thing about it. 1 was accessory be- 



fore and during the fact, for that 
matter, though that circumstance 
was beyond my then knowledge. 
That rigorous Earthside screening 
was bearing a variety of forbidden 
fruit that 1 knew of — and maybe 
there were more 1 hadn’t heard 
about. If there were 1 wanted right 
now to keep not hearing about an- 
other thing wrong. 

1 spent some time thinking and 
wandering here and there in the 
dome until 1 began to collect ques- 
tioning glances. I needed to think 
and to think alone. 1 could suit up 
and go for a walk on the surface 
outside, or I could lock myself into 
the Penthouse. Walking on the out- 
side in quest of nothing, more than 
solitude required to commune with 
oneself was not smiled upon. So, 
the Penthouse. 

1 have not really spoken of this. 
The Penthouse was a kind of oasis 
or sanctuary or hideout — a small 
but airy space fitted with sofas, 
chairs, a bookcase, directly be- 
neath the apex of the dome. Pleas- 
ant by lunar day and awesome by 
night. 

Its door was one of seven in the 
entire dome to carry a lock. Access 
was free to anyone, but on a wait- 
ing-list basis. For reasons 1 thought 
1 understood, someone in Project 
Design had decreed that no more 
than two persons could be in the 
Penthouse at the same time. And 
there was a time limit' of one hour. 
Couples now and then went there 
to fornicate, of course, but the 
waiting list was never very long — it 
was an eerie place which did not 
appeal to all. But it appealed to me 
with force, particularly now. There 
was a waiting list, yes, but 1 was the 



LUNAONE 



163 




keeper of the list. Rank has its 
privileges. So I spent a bit of time 
up there the three or four days after 
hearing the fetal heartbeat of my 
child. 

I’d thought at first that the new 
problem would submerge the oth- 
ers — the alcohol, dogs and 
cats — and indeed that was the case 
in the beginning, but very shortly I 
found to my consternation and 
added anxiety, that all the diffi- 
culties complemented and rein- 
forced each other, revealing them- 
selves as but different aspects of the 
same problem. 

ttp ARP,” Andy Rikishin said. 

U “I’ve been looking for you.” 
I’d been wandering around aim- 
lessly, preparing myself for a talk 
with Carole. 

“How’s Shau?” 

His face lit for a moment. “Just 
fine. We got away with that one all 
right. I guess.” Then the clouds 
came over. “And 1 did do away 
with the pot,” he said. “You 
know.” 

“I know. If you say’so, Andy.” 

“But there’s a bigger problem 
now.” 

Good, I thought. I’ll submerge 
mine into yours, hence have less of 
my own to deal with. “Want to tell 
me about it in the Penthouse?” 1 
asked. “Nobody there now.” 

“All right.” 

We went there. Comfortable 
chairs, lunar day, Eratosthenes out 
there and other features anyplace 
you wanted to look. Not much va- 
riety, though. 

“The thing is, Carp — ” Andy 
said and stopped. “The thing is,” 
he began again, “Sandra is preg- 



nant. Like about five months.” 

I looked at Andy, said nothing, 
turned to look out upon my crater. 

“That’s bad, isn’t it. Carp?” I 
heard. 

I faced him. “You might say 
that. You might say it makes a 
puzzle, a few pieces of which are 
clicking autonomously together..’ 
Andy gave me a blank look. 

“It’s The Mai and The Chair- 
man all over again, Andy, but this 
time with people. Carole and 
Sandra- and hence you and I — are 
in the same boat.” 

He thought about that briefly. 
He was a bright boy. 1 could see he 
was glad to have company. “I 
thought Sandra’s been putting on 
weight,” he said. “I only found out 
last night.” 

“How?” I asked. “Did she tell 
you?” 

“No. I, well, heard it. Her. Him. 
And thought I felt him move, too.” 
“Does she know that you 
know?” 

“Yes. I told her right off.” 
“What did she say?” 

“She said a lot, Carp, but what it 
came down to was that no fascist 
gang of cowards on Earth was go- 
ing to tell her what to do with her 
body. She swore a lot. She used 
words I didn’t know she knew.” 
“Yes. We have a problem, 
Andy, no doubt of that.” 

“What do we do about this 
one?” 

“Good question. 1 don’t have the’ 
answer to it yet. But Tm working 
on it.” 1 put my hand on his shoul- 
der. “Say hello to The Mai and 
Ling Ling for me. And to Sandra,” 

1 said. “She’ll already know about 
Carole.”

I left him to have a talk with my 
headstrong wife. 

KNEW you’d find out sooner 
* or later, Pete. Of course. But 
the thing is this: a woman’s preg- 
nancy — or the lack of it, the avoid- 
ance of it — is the most important 
thing that happens in a woman’s 
body. 1 don’t think Project De- 
sign — ” and here she interposed 
some descriptive words I hadn’t 
known she knew either — “included 
one woman, one honest-to-God fe- 
male in its decision-making 
machinery.’’ 

“Collins could have done an AB. 
Maybe even now — ’’ 

“No, Pete. This was no accident. 
I — and Sandra — are going to have 
our babies. Aren’t you glad?” 

“I confess that I am. But look at 
the problem. How many others? 
Luna One can sustain but so 
many.” 

“Yes. But we’ll say how 
many — and when.” 

“I’ve got to go right now. But 
one final word for you — sweet- 
heart.” 

“Yes?” 

“Whatever happens, you are one 
honest-to-God female woman.” 
Her look almost did me in, but I 
knew how much I had to do and I 
moved away. “You’ll think of 
something,” I heard her say. 

1 sought Antonio Scartia. I 
found him in his lab on the fourth 
level. 

“Hi, Carp.” 

“Tony. 1 need to talk with you. 
Right now. All right?” 

“Well, sure. I’ve work to do, 
but—” 

“Now,” 1 said. I pulled a book 



from my pocket and checked my 
memory. “Nobody there. Let’s go 
up to the Penthouse.” 

Tony followed me through the 
passages and I went into that place 
for the second time that day. We 
stood there warily. At least Tony 
was wary. I’d summoned him and 
he waited to hear what I had to say. 

So I said it. “The fact is, Tony, 
that I’m in the middle of a sticky 
mess — along with some other 
folk — and I’d like to sit here qui- 
etly to think about it. With a good 
stiff drink or two to hand. You, 
Antonio Scartia, are the only one I 
know who can provide it.” 

VII 

It is said that while drunk 
he attempted to kiss his re- 
flection in a moonlit river, 
fell into the water, and 
drowned. 

Traditional account 
of Li Po’s death 

CARTIA’S face didn’t show 
much. If the input to his com- 
puter was overloaded he gave no 
indication of that. He was cycling, 
1 saw, like an IBM 7071 dealing 
with an equation on the fringes of 
its capability. It took time. 

Then: “I don’t get it. Carp.” 
“Come off it, Tony. I know you 
had a still in your lab. You knew 1 
knew and you moved it. I could 
have confiscated it at the time. I 
gave you a chance to hide it. And 
don’t ask me why. I’m in more 
trouble than you can possibly ever 
be in on Luna One. So, Tony, let’s 
drop the pretense and kindly bring 
me a drink. I’ll leave you with your 




LUNAONE 



165 




problems, and you’ll do the same 
with me.” 

Some more cycling in the com- 
puter and then the sun came out. 

“As it happens,” he said, “I do 
have a little something left over 
from a small experimental project. 
If I bring it to you you can hang me 
for it, figuratively speaking, that is. 
But you won’t.” 

“I won’t. And what is that out- 
ragious grin about?” 

“Just that I’ve always known 
there would be room for a — well, 
service organization like ours. 
Here — or wherever we’ll go after- 
ward. I’ll be right back.” 

He returned shortly with what 
appeared to be a leather pouch, 
from which he extracted a glass 
and a corked liter beaker filled with 
amber fluid. Not just a little in the 
bottom, it was full. I relocked the 
door and we sat there at the top of 
our world. 

“You haven’t exactly given me a 
quid pro quo," Scartia said, “but I 
don’t think I’m worried about that. 
You want me to go now?” 

“Sit down a minute and have one 
with me, Tony,” I said. “Though 
we both be on duty at the mo- 
ment.” 

He withdrew a second small 
glass and filled it and mine. We 
raised glasses in a silent toast. Now 
I was the wary one, but I tried 
whatever it was and it was good. 

“That is good, Tony,” I said. 
“Thanks. Thanks very much. It 
isn’t the alcohol so much as — 
something going back there.” I 
nodded to the blue-green Earth. 

“What’s your problem, Carp, if 
you want to talk about it? I’ve got 
one of my own, matter of fact.” 



“I’ll tell you,” I said, wondering 
why I was taking this youth, boy, 
man into my confidence. “You’re 
aware, of course, of the rules con- 
cerning reproduction on Luna 
One?” He nodded, permitted his 
left eyebrow a micrometric rise. 
“My wife is five months pregnant. 
So is another wife I know. Those 
are the main problems. There are 
others, such as an illegal Peking- 
ese, no doubt some kittens here and 
there — what’s funny now?” 

“An awful lot of people know 
about Shau,” he said. “Everybody 
except Winter and John Edgar, I’d 
say.” Then his face clouded. “But 
the girls are another problem, yes. 
We’ll have to find ways of taking 
care of that. I have news for you.” 
“Yes?” 

“Gina is three months pregnant.” 
The computer was busy again, I 
could see in Scartia’s eyes. New 
data had been thrust into the in- 
take — he was working on it and 1 
knew why I had brought him up to 
the Penthouse. I had done so only 
partly to ask him for a drink 1 
knew he had and I wanted, a drink 
he wasn’t supposed to have. Scartia 
was an organizer. 

“How did that happen?’’ I 
asked. 

“You know Gina. She’s a ti- 
gress. She decided she wouldn’t let 
anybody tell her what to do. She 
didn’t tell me until after.” 

“They never do.” We sat in si- 
lence for a time. “You begin to see 
the problem, Tony?” 

“I think I do.” 

“If this is going on all through 
Luna One we’re going to be in seri- 
ous difficulty very soon. 1 don’t 
mean you, the other presumptive 



166

parents, me, Carole. I mean the 
colony. We have to follow rules. Or 
we die.” 

The level in the beaker was 
slowly falling. “You’re right, Carp. 
You’re right.” 

“You have any answers, then?” 
“I might have. You?” 

“Yes.” 1 looked out at Eratos- 
thenes and thought about the Great 
Southern Butte in Idaho. 1 thought 
about Idaho potatoes, tubers that 
could be eaten and from which al- 
cohol could be made. “Tony,” I 
said. “Did you tell Gina not to take 
the pill?” 

He paled a little in the harsh 
light of the dome. It was hot out 
there on the other side of the skin, 
but here, where it was needed most, 
the air-conditioning was adequate. 
“I did not. Carp. I swear on the 
Bible of my family, I did not.” 
“Neither did 1 tell Carole,” I 
said. “Nor did Andy tell Sandra, 
he says, and I believe him.” 

A ll this was going into the 
Seartia computer. “So. The 
girls won’t be told whether or when 
to have babies. They violate 
Project Design.” A look of 
spurious virtue on his face for a 
moment. 

“They violate Project Design in 
their way. Indeed they do. And we, 
the men, in ours, eh, Tony? Booze, 
pot, probably other things I don’t 
know about.” 

“Well, if you put it that way. It 
comes down to, we won’t let 
Project Design tell us what to do, 
how to run everything.” 

“This,” I said, holding my small 
glass, “is a very fine product, Tony. 
What did you make it from?” 



“Corn. Good Iowa corn.” 

“I thought so. But, you can see, 
Tony, that if every girl on Luna 
One decides she can get pregnant 
any time she wants to we’re all in 
deep trouble. You see that.” 

“Of course.” 

“I am second in command of 
this colony. We must have dis- 
cipline or we die. You do see that, 
Seartia?” 

He smiled an ancient kind of 
smile — it seemed to go back two 
thousand years. He nodded. “I see. 
The discipline we need, yes. And 
we’ll get it. But from us, up here, 
and not from those down there.” 
“You think we can do it?” 

“As you say. Carp, we do it or 
we die. But takes — organization. I 
say we can do it.” There was a light 
in his eye and I knew I had to say 
something. 

“We’ll have to do something or 
Luna One becomes a minus sign in 
the books of extraterrestrial explo- 
ration,” 1 said. “This is good stuff, 
by the way. Let’s finish it.” Seartia 
emptied the beaker. “A certain 
reorganization will be necessary,” I 
said. 

“This is obvious.” 

“Yes. And it will be done. But 
there’s something I have to say to 
you, Tony.” He looked at me, ea- 
ger, thinking and planning, build- 
ing a new Luna One. “There will be 
no place here,” I said, “for a Don 
Antonio, if you take my meaning.” 
He flashed those impossibly 
white teeth my way. “I know. 
Carp. I know. I do. There’s no 
place here for the cosa you’re 
thinking about. Not that kind. No 
way. If we wind up with a Don, it 
won’t be me. It’ll be Don Pierre. 



LUNAONE

That has a nice sound to it.” 
“Nonsense. Listen, Tony. We’ll 
have to have a meeting. Tomorrow. 
Not a big one. Who, from your 
point of view, do we have to have?” 
“We going to take over, Don 
Pierre?” 

“Listen, Tony. Don’t call me 
that. But we must get going, we 
must do something. Such a simple 
thing, for example, as finding out 
as soon as possible how many preg- 
nant women we have here. And 
stopping any more conceptions 
forthwith. On terms the girls will 
accept. How many do we have? 1 
wonder. They won’t tell Winter 
and they won’t tell their husbands 
until it’s done. But they’ll have to 
tell us. So who — as you see it — is 
us going to be?” 

“Okay, Don — 1 mean Carp. Us 
is going to be you, me, Charlie Er- 
skine, Andy, Bob McDonald, Doc 
Collins. For starters. Is enough? 
Did I leave anybody out?” 

“You know a lot about Luna 
One, don’t you, Tony? Those 
names would be on my list, too, 
though 1 don’t know much about 
Erskine. He’s part of your — oper- 
ation?” 

“Yes.” 

“How many stills?” 

“Just the two. Production’s 
pretty good, though. Why didn’t 
you root them out? You knew we 
had one that day.” 

W HE girls don’t have it all, do 
X they? 1 don’t like to be told 
altogether what to do any more 
than they do. Than you do. Or An- 
dy or Charlie. Or the dogs and 
cats, for that matter. The Mai, The 
Chairman, Little Otto, the lot. 



Now, back to your list for a min- 
ute. You, me, Erskine, Rikishin, 
McDonald, Collins. Right?” 
“Right.” 

“That list is fatally flawed.” 

Tony was startled. “How so?” 
“You’d get it if you thought 
about it a little, but I’m in a hurry. 
No women on it, Tony. No women. 
What have these girls been showing 
us if not that they must be in on 
making the decisions that involve 
them? You think they’ll let us dic- 
tate to them just because we’re here 
on Luna One, and not back on 
Earth in Project Design?” 

“Jesus. You’re right all the 
way.” He shook his head. 

“All right. We’ll have to think of 
whom to appoint to our, er, com- 
mittee from the distaff side. Think 
about it and we’ll all talk about it 
tomorrow.” 

“All right. So we meet tomor- 
row. Where and when?” 

“This seems a good place,” 1 
said, looking again at Eratos- 
thenes. 

“Not supposed to be more than 
two people here at once, Carp,” 
Scartia said, putting me on. 

“If we’re going to change things 
we might as well start here. Any- 
way, we’ll have more privacy here 
than anyplace else.” 

“One more thing.” 

“Yes?” 

“This is no child’s game we play 
here. Carp. The stills, sort of, were. 
Are. Taking over Luna One from 
Project Design is something else. 
There’s one place we’ll have to be 
very sure of.” 

“Yes?” I knew, but 1 was testing 
the guy 1 was beginning to think of 
as my lieutenant. 



168 



GALAXY 




“The electronics bay. If Project 
Design got onto this they could 
send a lot of trouble up with the 
last supply ship.” 

“Can you take care of it?” 

“1 think so.” I saw that he knew 
he could. “Carp?” 

“Yes?” 

He put the empty beaker and 
glasses into the pouch. “You’d al- 
ready thought about the need to 
control the electronics bay, right?” 
“Well, yes.” 

“Good. You don’t have to test 
me any more. Carp. I’ll be all right 
at what we have to do. Though I 
should have thought of putting 
women on the committee.” 

1 began to deny that I’d been 
waiting to see if he’d bring up the 
vital question of Earth-Moon com- 
munication during our proposed 
reorganization, but had the sense 
to see that I shouldn’t. 

“All right, Tony, call it a test if 
you want. I did wonder if you’d see 
the absolute need to control that 
part of Luna One. You did. You 
get A Plus. I don’t apologize for 
the test, understand.” 

“That’s right,” he said. “That’s 
right, Don Pierre,” and he was 
gone before I could reply. 

I WALKED slowly back to my 
office. We didn’t have much 
time, if many of the women on 
Luna One were pregnant (as the 
sample I knew about certainly in- 
dicated) we were already in bad 
shape and the least we had to do 
was stop the increase in fetal pop- 
ulation right now. Yesterday. My 
formal responsibility was to ap- 
proach Winter with this. Clearly 



Luna One stood in need of change 
and Project Design wasn’t going 
to be the instrument to effect it. 
Where would Winter be? I checked 
the names of the technicians and 
operators in the electronics bay. I 
knew them all and hoped they 
would be on our side. There were 
six of them, four boys and two 
girls. 1 decided not to wait for 
meeting tomorrow. I went to talk 
to Winter. He welcomed me with 
the usual frosty smile. 

“I’ve been thinking,” I said. 
“About the Pekingese puppies.” 
“Yes.” 

“What if the same thing hap- 
pened with one or two Luna One 
women? The problem — or the solu- 
tion — wouldn’t be the same, would 
it?” 

“Do you have anyone in mind?” 
“No. But the puppies are in my 
mind and 1 think about the 
possibility.” 

“It would be a different prob- 
lem, yes, and a more serious one. 
We’re one over our quota right 
now. Five hundred and sixty-nine, 
which is one too many. No one will 
get a Conception Certificate until 
someone dies, obviously.” 

“I understand. But what if a 
woman does become pregnant?” 
“Accidentally or by design?” 
“Either way.” 

“It would have to be the same 
thing, either way. The major im- 
perative of Luna One, according to 
Project Design is to control the 
population. You know this as well 
as I. We all do.” 

“Yes. All right, we’ve had one 
baby over the quota already and 
Project Design didn’t go into too 
great a flap about it. What if we 



LUNAONE 



169 




have two or maybe three more?” 

“If we had one more, Charpen- 
tier, the council might let it go — if 
it were convinced that it was a case 
of the pill’s not working. But any 
more than that — ” 

“What?” ' 

“They’d have to — go, that’s all. 
Dr. Collins would have an unen- 
viable but inescapable responsi- 
bility.” 

Not with my — son? daughter? 
he wouldn’t. Mine and Carole s. 
Andy's and Sandra’s. Gina’s and 
Tony’s. 

“What if the council voted to let 
it pass?” 

“I would overrule. I can do that 
in some cases, you know — and this 
is one.” 

1 knew that as well as he did, be- 
cause I’d checked it out. What I 
was really up to here was a probing 
of Winter’s attitudes. 

“That would be a pretty tough 
line to follow,” 1 said. 

“That’s right. Tough, but neces- 
sary. Does that answer your ques- 
tion, Charpentier?” 

“It does. Thanks, Winter. I’ve 
been thinking about the puppies, 
that’s what got me onto it.” 



T here was no doubt in my 
mind that he meant what he 
said. It was getting late, but now I 
needed to call another meeting. I 
wished for some kind of telephone 
but there wasn’t one, so I went out 
through the passages in search of 
Andy Rikishin and Antonio 
Scartia. I found them and led them 
back to my office. I told them 
about my interview with Winter. 
“So,” Andy said. “Unless we do 



something, at least two dead 
babies. Ours.” 

“One of them mine, for sure,” 
Scartia said. “Gina’s only three 
months pregnant.” 

“Yes,” I said to Andy. “At least 
one of them ours, yours or mine. 
And God knows how many other 
pregnant women there are on Luna 
One.” 

“We must move now,” Scartia 
said. “Before tomorrow’s 
meeting.” 

“You realize the importance of 
communications?” 

“The radio to Earth?” 

“Yes. Let’s nail that down first, 
then confront Winter. Tonight.” I 
gazed at my fellow mutineers. 
“You understand this begins to be 
serious?” 

They nodded silently. I found the 
list in the clutter of papers on my 
desk. “These people are the crew of 
the electronics bay,” I said. “Get 
them here as fast as you can.” 

“I know who they are,” Scartia 
said. He looked at Andy. “You get 
th ese,” he said, checking two 
names on the list. “I’ll get the other 
three. One will have to stay on 
duty.” 

“You don’t think we’re moving a 
little too fast?” Andy asked, look- 
ing at me. 

I started to answer, but Scartia 
came more quickly to the point. 
“How many more women on Luna 
One are going to get pregnant in 
the next week if we don’t get going 
now?” 

Andy and Scartia set off to 
round up five of the six operators 
of the communications gear and 1 
sat there, alone for the moment, 
considering options. Were we in- 



170 



GALAXY 




deed moving precipitately? The 
thought of the fetal heartbeat in- 
side Carole told me, no, not fast 
enough. 

In about fifteen minutes Andy 
and Scartia were back with five of 
the six operators. 

The five: Linda Escalante, Irene 
du Uribe, Tadashi Shimizu, Paoli 
Bartolini and Illingworth Whittle. 
Which left Karl Kraft minding the 
store. Of these five, two girls, three 
boys. They were all younger than I 
and I thought of them as such, boys 
and girls, though they were really 
men and women. Linda was from 
Argentina, Irene from Brazil. Ta- 
dashi from Yokohama, Paolo from 
Milano and Illingworth from Lon- 
don. It had been difficult at first to 
know what to call Illingworth, a 
name not easily susceptible to fa- 
miliarity, but those who knew him 
had settled on Whit. 

The eight of us in my office now. 
Mostly they had to sit on the 
floor — I had a small office. I ad- 
dressed the delegation from 
electronics. 

“This may come as a surprise to 
you,” I said. “Our colony is quite 
possibly in grave danger. It is prob- 
ably that Luna One will, at least 
temporarily, have to be out of all 
radio contact with Earth, particu- 
larly with Project Design.” 1 had 
my audience, all right. “It is likely 
that we — a group of us, some of 
us — will have to neutralize Mayor 
Winter in some way and undertake 
to run the colony under new rules, 
rules we make ourselves.” 

“Why, Carp?” asked Tadashi 
Shimizu. 

“It’s not a short story,” I said. 
“Let me ask you something first. 



You girls,” I said, looking at Irene 
and Linda. “Are either of you 
pregnant?” Some consternation. I 
looked at the boys. “And you,” I 
said. “Is the wife of any of you 
pregnant?” More consternation. 
“All right. Our colony is in trouble 
because at least three women in the 
colony are unlawfully pregnant. 
These are the wives of Andy, Tony 
and me. We don’t know how many 
more there are. But if the ones we 
know about are any sample you 
can see the trouble we’re in. Win- 
ter’s solution, and Project Design 
will certainly back him up in it, is 
to — well, do away with the illegal 
babies. So we propose to take over. 
It’s obvious that we need your 
help.” 



T hey all started to talk at once. 

I raised my hand to silence 
them. “Before we get onto that, 
however, how about you, Linda?” 
“I’m not. But I’ve been thinking 
about it.” 

“Irene?” 

“1 have to say — maybe. I didn’t 
take the pill and I’m four days 
overdue.” 

“Paul know about this?” 

“No. I didn’t tell him.” 

“The pattern continues. You 
three!” I said, nodding to the men. 

Tadashi and Paolo said, not as 
far as they knew. Whittle didn’t 
know either but thought his wife. 
Use, had been putting on weight 
lately. 

“So. Are you with us or not? 
You can see why we need you.” 
“Winter would kill the babies?” 
Linda asked. 

“He would. Or, rather, he’d have 



LUNAONE 



171 




Doc Collins do it. And he would 
have full official backing.” 

“No doubt of that?” Tadashi. 
“None.” 

“Then 1 for one am with you,” 
Tadashi said. 

“So am I,” Linda said. “Obvi- 
ously. Though I’m not sure yet.” 
The other three made it unani- 
mous. So that made eight of us out 
of the five hundred odd. 

“We’ll need Karl, too,” I said. 
“Will one of you relieve him and 
send him here?” 

Tadashi left and a few minutes 
later Karl Kraft came into the of- 
fice. 1 explained the situation. “My 
wife isn’t pregnant,” he said. “Not 
that I know about, anyway. And 
this amounts to mutiny.” 

“I don’t know what word to put 
on it,” 1 said. “But are you with us 
or not?” I noted Scartia’s vigilant 
pose here and knew how important 
he would be in whatever it was we 
would wind up doing. 

“I don’t know. This is all very 
new and I need to think about it.” 
“There’s not much time to think 
about it.” 

“How about survival of the col- 
ony on Winter’s terms. On the 
terms of Project Design, that is?” 

I looked at Andy and Scartia. 
“No way,” Scartia said. “Not if 
it’s your kid being put to sleep out 
there in the deep freeze. No way. 
Our course is clear, Karl. The ques- 
tion is, are you with us?” 

“What if I’m not?” 

“You’d better be,” I said. “This 
is a matter of life and death. Sev- 
eral lives and deaths we know 
of — others most likely. You can 
see that.” 

“Best you be on the right side,” 



Scartia said and he communicated 
something I hadn’t. Kraft got the 
message. 

“When does this takeover 
happen?” 

Scartia, Andy and I looked at 
each other. “The sooner the bet- 
ter,” I said and the other two 
nodded. 

“Okay,” Kraft said. “My wife 
isn’t pregnant — ” and he stopped. 

Y OU’VE seen a human brain at 
work? No, nor has anyone, but 
there are times when it seems that 
this is what you’re watching and 
this was one. Each to his own im- 
agery. Mine was rather old-fash- 
ioned: reels of magnetic tape spin- 
ning, memory chips (figuratively) 
flipping and flopping, lights danc- 
ing on and off on a handsome dis- 
play panel. 

■‘I’m with you,” Kraft said. 
“Good.” We shook hands all 
around. The girls left with the three 
men from electronics. “From now 
on,” I said, as they were leaving, 
“there will always be two people at 
the station. Until we’re squared 
away. Understood?” 

Murmurs of approval and 
understanding. 

“Do we go see Winter now?” 
Scartia asked. 

“The sooner, as has been said, 
the better. Andy?” 

“Let’s put it to him right off, I 
say. But what do we do after we’ve 
put it to him?” 

“We’ll play it by ear as we go 
along.” Scartia nodded. “Let’s 

go” 

We strode rather awkwardly, I 
thought, into his presence.

“The hypothetical case 1 put to 
you this morning wasn't hypo- 
thetical,” I said. “The fact is that 
our three wives, each and every 
one, are pregnant. We don’t pro- 
pose to put up with the doing away 
of the babies. Will you go along 
with us?" 

He sat there quietly. Cool, real 
cool. 

“I suspected as much, Pierre," 
he said. “In answer to your ques- 
tion, no, I shall not go along with 
you. We shall, all of Luna One, go 
along with Project Design.” He 
opened a desk drawer. “As it hap- 
pens," he said, “this was a possi- 
bility not overlooked by Project 
Design. I’d hoped it wouldn’t come 
to this. But I am not without re- 
source, Pierre. And Scartia, and 
Rikishin. There will be no mutiny 
on Luna One." He made to reach 
into the drawer. 

“Don’t move,” Scartia said qui- 
etly. “Don’t move. Winter." 

Winter rested his right hand on 
his lap. “Better not,” I said. “What 
is it?" 

“A button, that’s all." Winter 
said. “1 push it and Project Design 
gets a message you can in no way 
stop. A separate transmitter,” he 
said. He placed his hand on the 
front edge of the drawer. “I can 
touch it before you can touch me,” 
he said to Scartia, who had edged 
toward the side of the desk. 

I looked at Scartia. He nodded. 
“There’s a black box in there, all 
right.” 

“Yes there is,” Winter said. 
“And if one of you comes one step 
nearer, 1 push it. It’s automatic 
from there on out, can’t be shut 
off.” 



We stood our ground. 

“We’re taking over,” I said. 
“For the survival of the colony. It 
won’t work the way Project Design 
wants it to. God knows how many 
pregnant women we have here al- 
ready. We can control our birth 
rate and lives ourselves, but we — 
particularly the women — won’t let 
Project Design do it. It won’t 
work. Winter. You’d better come 
along with us.” 

“I guess I’ll have to push the but- 
ton, then,” he said, still cool. Very 
cool. 

“Don’t move that hand,” Scartia 
said. 

“So what happens if you push 
it?” 

“They’ll send ships. They’ll put 
you down. Luna One must survive, 
you see.” 

“We see and we agree. But it will 
survive our way, not theirs. Not 
yours.” 

“You’re wrong,” Winter said. 
And he moved his hand. 

“Don’t — ” Scartia cried. But the 
movement was halfway there, so 
Scartia made one of his own. A 
flash of light flew (almost gently, it 
seemed) through the short distance 
and landed in Winter’s fifth inter- 
costal space. A sliver of silver 
glinted in the light. Winter sank 
back into his chair, slowly, grace- 
fully, his hand withdrawing from 
the drawer. 

“No other way,” Scartia said 
to him. 

Andy was pale. No doubt I was, 
too. “Good throw, Tony,” I said. 
“Now there are some things we 
must do. Right now.” 

“Yes. Yes, Don Pierre.” 

We took first things first.

If heaven loved not the 
wine, a Wine Star would not 
be in heaven. 

Li Po 

T here was no morgue on Luna 
One. This would have been an 
extravagant use of space. Recy- 
cling of the departed had been 
thought of, but even Project Design 
hadn’t been able to go along with 
that. What we were left with, then, 
was a plot not too far from Luna 
One, tastefully positioned behind a 
pile of stored goods and assorted 
debris, where we were meant to 
scoop out shallow trenches to re- 
ceive our fatalities, of which this 
was the second. 

It will be understood that we 
could not go on the intercom, there 
being none, to announce the sudden 
death, by acute coronary attack, of 
our leader. There had been talk of 
two-meter FM to keep everyone in 
touch with important news, but 
that had been vetoed somewhere 
along the line. What we had was a 
duplicating machine and a lot of 
passages. 

“We’ll have to get Doc Collins in 
on this,’’ 1 said. “1 know he’s on 
our side, though we haven’t kept 
him in touch with what’s been go- 
ing on the last hour or so. Andy?” 
“I’ll find him.” He left. 

Scartia and I alone with the dead 
one. “I had to do it, Don Pierre. 1 
did. You know?” 

“I haven’t hit you for it, have I? I 
deplore violence. But I agree you 
had to do it. It was his form of vio- 
lence or ours. And call me Carp.” 



“All right.” 

Andy came back with Collins. 
“Doc,” I said. “We’ve had a 
sudden heart failure here. Our 
leader has fallen. We’ll need, 1 
guess, for Project Design, a death 
certificate. At least an oral one 
over the air, right?” 

Collins saw the neat gash. I filled 
him in. 

“All right,” he said. “First 
things first. Let’s plant him.” 

I T WAS the beginning of the 
Luna One night, but the middle, 
just about, of the lunar day. Collins 
and Andy left, came back with a 
litter and straps. The four of us, 
pall bearers now, carried our awk- 
ward burden down to the lock. We 
met two people on the way. We 
told them someone had died. Who, 
they had asked. Winter, we had 
said. They’d hurried off to wherev- 
er they’d been going before we’d 
run into them in the passages. 

We suited up, next to the skin at 
ground level, and carried the body 
out onto the lunar surface, then be- 
hind the storage pile and the junk 
to the place where the other one 
was. Two shovels there, unmoved 
since we’d put Jeff Barnes down. I 
stood watching, now and again 
looking up at Earth, while Andy 
and Scartia dug a shallow trench. 1 
remembered seeing old tapes of the 
Apollo missions, with the dust 
moving ever so gently. It was like 
that now, but we were on a differ- 
ent mission. 

“That ought to do it,” Scartia 
said. All the suits had a common 
circuit. We could talk, but no one 
else could hear us. 

“Ashes to ashes and dust to 



174 



GALAXY 




dust,” I said. “If the women don’t 
get you, the liquor must.” 

“I didn’t know you were an anti- 
quarian,” Collins said. “Someone 
could come up here a thousand 
years from now and see this bird 
didn’t shuffle off with a coronary, 
you know.” 

“That’s right. I don’t think any- 
one will, though, do you?” 

We went back inside and un- 
suited. Collins and Andy put tbe 
litter and straps away. We met in 
the electronics bay. Irene and Ta- 
dashi had the duty. “You’ll be in- 
terested to hear this,” I said. “Put 
me on the horn.” 

Now we had a brief exercise in 
bureaucracy. I told Project Design 
that Mayor Winter was unexpect- 
edly dead and they said that was 
too bad. I put Collins on and he did 
violence to his Hippocratic oath. 
Then 1 got back on and they said I 
was now mayor and to carry on un- 
der all appropriate regulations and 
to appoint an executive mayor 
without delay. 1 said yes, and did it 
at that moment by winking at An- 
tonio Scartia. 

I thanked Irene and Tadashi and 
told them I’d be in touch with them 
in the morning. We left the elec- 
tronics bay and I spoke to my three 
colleagues. 

“We are now going to talk for a 
few moments and we are going to 
have a drink. With our girls. In the 
Penthouse. In five minutes.” 
Carole was fussed at me because 
I was late home and hadn’t been in 
touch. I told her what we’d done 
and that we were going to have a 
party, or wake of sorts, and she 
came along with me to the Pent- 
house. Scartia arrived a moment 



later with Gina, a container of am- 
ber fluid, and eight glasses. Then 
the rest were there and we filled the 
glasses and looked at each other 
and up at Earth. 

“To survival,” I said and we 
drank to that. 

“Now we will spend an hour or 
so here and talk of what we must 
do next — how it will go, beginning 
tomorrow. We will have to com- 
municate with five hundred-plus 
people. It is, excuse me, a new ball 
game.” 

We drank to that, too. 

“In one way we’re right back to 
Project Design,” Collins said. 

“How’s that?” 

“Right on target. Five hundred 
and sixty-eight people.” 

So we had a small party there, 
sitting on the top of our small 
world. Carole and Sandra (they 
were the first, after all) exchanged 
glances that I thought I understood 
and 1 was glad to see that they in- 
cluded Gina immediately. Not that 
Gina could easily be kept out of 
anything. 

Then the glasses were empty and 
the party was over and Carole gave 
me a glance 1 knew I understood. 

“We’ve work to do,” I said. 
“Tomorrow. Good night.” 

Scartia and Gina gathered to- 
gether the container and the 
glasses. 

“Good night — Don Pierre,’’ 
Scartia said. 

I was too tired to make a point 
of it and Carole was pulling me 
along, her hand possessively in 
mine, so I shrugged to or at some- 
thing back at home that had come 
with us out here and we went to our 
place.
