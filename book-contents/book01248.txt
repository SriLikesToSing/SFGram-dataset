A thrilling new novelette 
by the author of SHILL I 





HYPOTHETICAL PLANET — This view, from an imaginary satellite, shows 
a hypothetical planet with a ring system similar to that of Saturn. Since the 
rings are separated by a very wide gap, it is possible that the satellite group 
is both numerous and complex. The one on which we are hypothetically 
standrng is composed of frozen methane and ammonia and a glacier of 
this ice is flowing into the canyon in the foreground. The sun of this system 
is a type M, red giant and the reflected rays have vaporized some of the 
methane-ammonia ice on the far horizon, turning it to fog and ice.

I THE I 




THE TITLE of this column, which 
seems an appropriate one, is a take- 
off on Olaf Stapledon’s famous 
superman novel. Odd John, It is, 
I hope, an auspicious take-off, and 
that the items reported here will 
be as interesting as the source of 
the title. For instance, the original 
title by Stapledon — whose first 
name actually was William and his 
middle the better known Olaf — 
was John Alive, In the the early 
summer of 1951, in a sedate but 
modern home in Simon’s Field, 
Caldy, West Kirby, Wirral, Eng- 
land, with Northern Wales in the 
background, the charming widow 
of the late Olaf Stapledon, who 
was also his first cousin, let me 
hold in my own two hands the 
holoscript of Alive”, known 

for the last two decades as Odd 
John (except in France where it 
was translated as “Just A Super- 
man”). The handwriting was 
small, precise, almost Lovecraftian, 
and covered sheets of paper 
the same size as his eventually 
printed book. Dr. Stapledon had 



even painted his own concept of 
his homo superior, John of the 
great, darkly luminous, impene- 
trable eyes, the frontal lobes of 
power, and the surprisingly woolly 
white skullcap of close-cropped 
hair. John Alive, living on after 
his creator had gone. It is one of 
the great regrets of my life that 
Olaf Stapledon died before I had 
the experience of meeting him. In 
the unimaginably distant days of 
the Last Men, he will still be re- 
membered as one of the “First 
Men of Fantasy.” 

And now to genre: dear old 
genre! What would we do with- 
out it, with or without italics? 
And aficionado! I sometimes won- 
der how we struggled through the 
first 20 years of Scifi, we petrifying 
old pioneers, without knowing we 
were aficionados of a genre! And 
how would we ever have had half 
our anthologies, I wonder, after 
the atom, if Conklin & Co. (of 
fellow anthologists) hadn’t hap- 
pened on Destination and Oper- 
ation and Project and Mission? 
(Come to think of it, wonder why 
we never had an atomic anthology 
called Mission: Fission,) Someday, 
if enough of you indicate that it 
interests you, I will discuss origins 
of terms like “stf” and “fen” and 
“egoboo” and “crifanac”; and 
even “gafia”. There’s a new one 
just taking hold: shlue, which is 
shock value run together like glue. 

HALF 124C4E, undergraduate at 
the University of Gemsback, ma- 
joring in 20th Century Motion 
Pictures, writing in the year 2055 
quotes an obscure scienti-film critic 



2 




for his term paper on “The Sci-Fi 
Cinema Factor and the Interplane- 
tary Dream”, Courtesy of Tour- 
malin’s Time Travel Service, a 
FK)rtion of this criticism is reprinted 
here from the century old collect- 
ors’ item, IF Magazine for Decem- 
ber, 1955: If one hundred years 
from now (Ackerman reported) 
man has still not conquered space, 
historians — and s.f. dodderers with 
century-long memories — can point 
accusingly to “Conquest Of Space” 
as the film that sabotaged rocket 
flight. 

I don’t know who would want to 
fly to Mars after seeing this painful 
picture. In fact, I don’t know 
who’d want to risk seeing another 
interplanetary film after “Con- 
quest,” except diehards like me. 
Maybe, as Eric Frank Russell and 
other voices have said, there are 
space people among us who want 
us to stay on Earth, and a picture 
like this wretched vehicle is an ex- 
cellent way of discouraging the 
susceptible. 

Take the portrayal of the space 
cadets in this betrayal of the inter- 
planetary dream: a more imlikely, 
ill-assorted collection of (s) crew- 
balls you’ve seldom seen. When I 
am President, the first law I’m go- 
ing to pass is that no Texans or 
Brooklynites can go on space flights 
— at least not as comic reliefs in 
movies. In the first place, they are 
no relief. (Is a second place really 
necessary?) 

A cogent friend of mine, con- 
noisseur of films, called this picture 
“criminal”, by which he did not 
mean arresting. Not since the may- 
hem of Four-Sided Triangle has 



murder most foul been perpetrated 
on what should have been a sure- 
fire hit. I don’t think people are 
stupid, but the guys who make the 
movies think they are. When we 
consider that all the movies are 
really intended to be big box-office, 
and that Hollywood is convinced 
the way to make a paying picture 
is to put a lot of money into it, it 
follows, does it not, the way to 
succeed is to make them lavish and 
stupid? All we really need is a little 
creative effort and integrity. But 
who’s going to do it? 

We should have something if 
Bradbury and Paul Gregory get 
together on Fahrenheit 451 for the 
legitimate stage. Or Jose Ferrer 
produces Bester’s IFA winner The 
Demolished Man. Or someone with 
a big soul (and pocketbook to 
match) signs me to turn Van 
Vogt’s SLAN into a screenplay. I’m 
holding my breath on To Walk the 
Night, the modem s.f. suspense 
classic by William Sloane pur- 
chased by Hollywood. 

THE THEME music from Destina- 
tion Moon, Things to Come and 
The Day the Earth Stood Still 
comes to me in a melodic melange 
from my front room as I sit in my 
office typing this. No, it’s not 
canned vibrations arriving via 
phonograph records or tapes, but 
the real Jerome Drexel Bixby, 
whose talented ivory-tickling fin- 
gers have also typed many a fine 
sci-fi story. He’s a house guest for

How can you get a man to go through the rigors of hell and 



learn to live with death at his elbow if you take away the 



dream? Amos defended his dream and found it a colossal . 






B y daylight the room was 

small and shabby. Amos had 
outgrown it, as he had outgrown 
the bed. 

But at night it still had its magic. 
When the Venetian blinds were 
closed and the light was ofl, the 
stars still came out fluorescently, 
and the planets, spinning gently in 
the smallest breath of air, seemed 
real and close. And the moon — 
pocked and familiar — a boy could 
almost reach up and touch it. 

Best of all was the S.1.2. — the 
Doughnut — glowing right above the 



bed, and the boy, lying there, was 
free-falling in space, one of the 
heroes, one of the spacemen. 

The boy was grown now, and 
the sun bleached the stars into tiny 
spots of paint and exposed the black 
thread that held up the planets 
and the S.1.2. The time for dreams 
was over. 

She bustled around the room. 
The models spun and swayed. 
“You’ll want this,” she said bri^ly, 
holding out the book. 

He took it, the thumbed, bat- 
tered Conquest of Space wiA the 



BY JAMES E. GUNN 




achingly beautiful Bones tells, and 
put it back on the shelf. “Gosh^ 
Mom/* he pleaded, trying to make 
her understand. “I don’t need that. 
I’m through with all this. Give this 
junk to Tommy.” 

“The way you talk — a person 
would think you weren’t coming 
back,” she complained, her voice 
breaking in the middle. 

“Now, Mom.” He slipped an 
arm around her shoulder and 
squeezed. “We’ve talked this out. 
I’m grown up; I’m not a boy any 
more. All these things” — he dis- 
missed them with a careless hand — 
“I’ve got to put away. But I’ll be 
back on leaves and Earth-duty and 
things.” 

She^s faded, he thought. Since 
he had been at the Academy. It 
had been a long time since he had 
thought she was the most beautiful 
woman in the world. His mother 
had grown old. 

It had been a sad trip home. 
Maybe it had been a mistake, com- 
ing home. Maybe it would have 
been better to have refused the 
leave. He had wanted to. But that 
wouldn’t have been fair, either. 

He folded over the thin, blue 
nylon of the spacepack and zipped 
it shut on his few personal belong- 
ings. Her eyes misted. Irritation 
crossed his face. “Now what’s the 
matter?” 

“You’re taking so little,” she said 
and caught her lower lip between 
her teeth. 

“You know the weight limit,” he 
said sharply. Then his voice soft- 
ened. “Ten pounds. To put that on 
the Doughnut takes sixteen hun- 
dred pounds of fuel. Whatever else 

6 



I need will be there. The Air Force 
won’t let me go naked.” 

“I know.” I^e sighed. She bright- 
ened determinedly. “If you’re 
packed, come right downstairs. I 
saved a piece of pie.” 

He slung the spacepack over his 
arm the way spacemen did. As they 
went down the stairs, he put his 
left arm clumsily around her waist. 
“Now, Mom, I don’t want any- 
thing to eat, honest. I couldn’t eat a 
bite.” 

“You aren’t going away from 
home empty, young man!” 

“Sure, Mom. All right. What- 
ever you say.” He dropped the bag 
on a chair in the hall and let him- 
self be led into the kitchen. 

She watched him eat, her eyes 
never leaving his face. He forced 
down the apple pie, not wanting it, 
fighting the eagerness to be gone, 
to be on his way. 

The kitchen was a place peculiar- 
ly his mother’s. There she was in 
command of things; there she had 
the courage to say what she had 
been wanting to say. “I just can’t 
understand why anyone would 
want to go flying off into nothing. 
Seems like there’s enough trouble 
right here on Earth without hunt- 
ing up more. Every time I turn on 
the television” — her eyes moved to 
the repeater screen flat against the 
kitchen wall — “it seems there’s 
some new crisis or the cold war is 
colder or hotter . .” 

“Oh, Mom! You know I’ve al- 
ways wanted — ever since I was a 
little boy, dreaming, playing rock- 
ets . .” 

“Little boys I can understand. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




Grown men are something else 
again. Like you said upstairs, you 
expect them to put away childish 
things. Why? — that’s all I want to 
know . .” 

“Because it’s there,” he said, 
knowing that to her this was no 
reason at all. But it was the reason 
men had always given their women 
for chasing a dream, not really able 
to explain. 

“It’s important,” he went on 
evenly, “tackling something really 
worth the doing. It’s the dream — 
like the one that led the settlers 
into the wilderness, that pulled the 
wagon trains across the prairies. It’s 
where men are making the future, 
men who really count, men like 
Rev McMillen and Bo Finch and 
Frank Pickrell. It’s putting some- 
thing out there where nothing has 
ever been — the Doughnut. Courage 
built it out of dreams. Guts holds it 
up. And that’s just the beginning. 
It’s the future out there.” 

“It’s death out there.” Absently, 
she brushed a wisp of graying hair 
back into place. “Like McMillen in 
his tomb, frozen, going around and 
around the Earth forever. The first 
man out; the first man to die. That 
should have warned us. It used to 
be war that took our men from us; 
now it’s that.” She looked up at the 
ceiling as if she were staring 
through it, as if she could see the 
little, plastic-and-nylon wheel spin- 
ning up there in the sun, where the 
sky is black and death is never far 
away. 

“Good-by, Mom.” He stood up 
abruptly, kissed her. Her lips were 
cold. “Don’t worry. I’ll be all right.” 

He walked quickly through the 

HOAX 



house, taking his cap from the closet 
shelf, picking up the spacepack 
from the chair. He stopped outside, 
hesitated, and looked back. 

Already the house seemed unreal, 
fading, like everything in it. Even 
his mother. 

He looked up, not seeing the 
small, swift glint of the Doughnut, 
not expecting it. The satellite wasn’t 
visible here until 0319. 

He walked a little, letting the 
Earth tug at him for the last time, 
thinking that this was fantasy now, 
soon it would be all as unreal as 
fiction. 

Out there was his reality. 

Within a few hours he would 
step out onto the vast concrete 
landing strip at Cocoa, Florida. 

It was the beginning of the great 
adventure. 



G ENERAL FINCH was shock- 
ingly old and ill. Amos com- 
pared the reality with the pictures 
at the Academy; The Cieneral: 
shaking hands with Pickrell, facing 
the Senate sub-committee, giving a 
memorial wreath to an anonymous 
pilot to place in orbit for all those 
men who had given their lives . 

But then General Beauregard 
Finch was an old man, four years 
past retirement age, almost seventy. 

The six years since McMillen’s 
fatal flight had aged the General, 
but with them he had built his own 
monument. Above him circled the 
Doughnut to which he had sacri- 
ficed his health, his life — as other 
men had sacrificed their health and 
their lives. 

It was worth it. It was the dream. 

7 




In the little waiting room near 
the platform, the General stood, 
still straight, still wearing proudly 
the honorary Doughnut insignia on 
his shoulder. “You^re going out 
there, Danton, taking with you all 
our honor, all our pride. We’ve 
never sent out a bad one, a coward 
or a fool. I don’t think we’ve 
started now. Only a few men have 
preceded you. Only a few will fol- 
low. It will always be a hard, lonely 
business out there. But there’s noth- 
more worth the doing.” 

The General had never been out 
there. By the time it was possible, 
he was too old. 

“What do they call you now — 
you cadet replacements?” 

“Pick’s pick, sir.” 

“Good enough. That’s what you 
are — picked men, selected and 
sorted and pruned, over and over. 
The best of the best. You’ve had 
the finest training we could give 
you. Remember though: it’s never 
enough — the picking or the train- 
ing. The job is always bigger than 
the man. What you’ve gone through 
is nothing to what is waiting for 
you.” 

Amos smiled politely. The Gen- 
eral could call it nothing, the 
Academy selection and training 
program : he had never been 

through it. Knowing it now, Amos 
could not have forced himself to 
go through it again: the unceasing 
torment of brain and body, the end- 
less tests of physical and pscho- 
logical endurance, the perpetual 
cramming of an infinite amount of 
information into a finite brain . 

Call it nothing. Call it five years 
of hell. 

8 



Out of 50,000 applications, 1,000 
had been accepted. After the in- 
tense physical and psychiatric tests, 
sixty were left. 

They received their reward: five 
years of training. Five years of fight- 
ing the books, of taking g's in the 
centrifuge while trying to function 
as a stage-three crewmember, of 
working out in the “whirligig,” of 
living in the “tank” with thirteen 
other men for weeks without end — 
knowing that the psychologists were 
watching . 

And always the growing pressure 
of failure as classmates dropped out, 
were culled, disappeared, were 
mentioned no more. 

Until there were five left to grad- 
uate. 

Five out of 50,000. Those were 
odds you refused to face when you 
started. The only way to survive 
was not to think about it, to take 
each trial as it came, and when the 
g^s built too high, to remember the 
dream and fight once more and 
once again. 

There couldn’t be anything 
tougher than that. The reality 
would be fulfillment. 

“Go on!” the General growled. 
“Get out there! I talk too much. 
The ship won’t wait, not even for a 
general.” 

He was coughing as Amos, in 
flight helmet and coveralls with the 
webbed harness over it, strode 
across the broad platform toward 
the tapering spire of the ferry. It 
was a typical three-stager, gleaming 
in its white, ceramic coating, its 
clean lines broken by stabilizer fins 
and the broad, ungainly wings on 
which the third stage would glide 

JAMES E. GUNN 




through the atmosphere to a pow- 
erless landing. 

The elevator, part of the giant, 
hammerhead crane, lifted Amos 
smoothly up the side of the ship. 
Across the hull of the third-stage, 
beside the vast expanse of wing, 
were painted these black words: 
McMILLEN’S FOLLY 

Amos read them and frowned. ’ 
Service irreverences were unavoid- 
able, but they belonged within the 
service, not out where the public 
could share them. To call the S.1.2 
the Doughnut was not too bad — ^he 
did it himself — ^but this name left a 
bad taste in the mouth. The hot 
hand of air friction could not erase 
it too soon. 

The thick, square door stood 
open and empty. Amos shrugged 
and stooped through the air lock 
into the familiar cabin of the M-5 
stage-three. 

He climbed the rungs of the lad- 
der toward the one unoccupied seat. 
On this trip he would be radio op. 

The others were in their places — 
captain, co-pilot, navigator, engi- 
neer — their smoothly helmeted 

heads like bowling balls precarious- 
ly balanced on seat backs. One of 
the bowling balls turned, became a 
face, hard, disinterested. The cap- 
tain. 

“Cadet-Trainee Danton, sir,” 
Amos said, saluting crisply, “re- 
porting for transportation.” 

“Oh, God!” the captain groaned 
at the co-pilot. His head twisted 
back toward Amos. “WhereVe you 
been? You think we’ve got nothing 
better to do than wait for a lousy 
cadet? Oh, never mind! Get 
strapped down! We know — old Bo 

HOAX 



was giving you speech 12B: ‘Words 
of advice and encouragement for 
cadets making their maiden trips: 
We’ve never sent out a bad one, a 
coward or a fool. I don’t think 
we’ve started now.’ ” 

Flushing Amos lifted himself into 
the vacant chair and clicked his 
harness straps into place. They’d 
have been waiting anyway. Take- 
off time wasn’t for five minutes, 
“What’s your specialty?” the cap- 
tain asked. 

“Pilot, sir.” 

“Watch, then. Maybe you’ll learn 
something. Know any radio?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Then this is an order: Keep 
your clammy hands off the instru- 
ments! Any communication that’s 
necessary. I’ll take care of. Under- 
stand?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Plug in your earphones or not 
as you choose, but don’t put on 
throat mikes. I don’t want you foul- 
ing up the circuits.” 

Amos’s face was burning, but he 
clenched his teeth and said, “Yes, 
sir.” 

The captain reached into an 
elasticized pocket beside his chair 
and pulled out a plastic bag. He 
dropped it to Amos. “Put it on.” 
“I’ve had free fall, sir,” Amos 
protested. “I won’t need this.” 
“You have, eh? How much?” 
“Almost seven minutes.” 

“Eighty seconds at a time in a 
Keplerian orbit! Nuts! This time 
you’ll get four hours just as a starter. 
Put it on! That’s an order.” 

Slowly Amos slipped the elastic 
behind his helmet and fitted the 
plastic ring over his mouth. It 

9 




wasn’t enough to come through the 
Academy. He had to prove himself 
all over again. 

‘‘Engineer?” 

“Engineer check-off complete.” 

“Navigator?” 

“Navigator check-off complete.” 

“Go-pilot?” 

“Co-pilot check-off complete.” 

“Radio op and captain’s check- 
off complete. Thirty seconds to 
blast-off.” 

“You were a little rough on the 
kid, Skipper.” 

“He can’t learn any younger. Or 
much older, either. Twenty-five sec- 
onds.” 

Amos twisted his head and looked 
out the unshielded windows of the 
canopy. Forget it, he told himself. 
There is always a Queeg, The serv- 
ices lured them, fed them made 
them strong. Nowhere else could 
they achieve satisfaction jo easily. 

“Fifteen seconds.” 

The horizon was a gently curving 
arc of purple-blue above the gray- 
black of the sea. Within minutes 
now, the liberated third-stage 
would fight its way out of the at- 
mosphere that scattered the blue of 
the sunlight and gave it to the sky. 
Within less than an hour, it would 
be in orbit, its velocity canceling 
Earth’s gravity. Within a few hours, 
he would be in the Doughnut . 

“Five seconds.” 

Anticipation flooded Amos’s 
throat, choking, unbearable. This 
was what it had been about, the re- 
lentless pressures, the endless tor- 
ment. This was it, about to hap- 
pen . 

“Three — two — one . .” 

10 



The cabin began to rumble. Like 
a torch rising from the ground to 
light their way, flame shot into the 
night from the exhaust outlet. Amos 
could see it reflected from the as- 
tronomical dome and the radar 
saucers and the control tower, etch- 
ing them into the blackness of the 
bay. 

“Engineering check — all motors 
blasting.” 

On the captain’s control panel, a 
red eye opened. “And away we go!” 
said the captain, exultation in his 
voice. “Up, beast!” 

The cabin roared. The torch out- 
side the window flamed intolerably. 
Amos squeezed his eyes shut, and 
the fine, strong net of acceleration 
pulled him into the seat cushions, 
fishhooking his cheeks down, tug- 
ging at his eyeballs. When he got 
his eyelids open again, orange-red 
dials were spinning in front of him, 
meaningless, the long hours in the 
centrifuge mock-up wasted. The 
net pulled, hard, inexorable. 

Amos tried to breathe, but his 
chest couldn’t lift against the in- 
tolerable weight that held it down. 
Panic surged, cold, in his stomach, 
up his throat . 

A few seconds later, the net dis- 
solved. The seat cushions, released, 
shoved Amos forward against the 
harness. His weight dropped from 
1,350 pounds down to a little less 
than 300. He drew a deep, shudder- 
ing breath and another. 

The first-stage had been dropped, 
its contribution made. Now the 
second booster was building its pres- 
sures, adding its acceleration to a 
speed that had already reached 
more than 5,000 miles per hour. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




Slowly the net drew down again. 
Again Amos’s breathing grew diffi- 
cult. He struggled for one more 
breath and one more. Then the net 
was down hard, and there was no 
more breath. 

Seconds passed. The pressure 
grew, never quite as hard as the 
first booster’s nine g^s but lasting 
longer. This time Amos went forty 
seconds without breathing. Then 
the second stage dropped away, and 
the pressure relented. 

Amos gasped for breath. 

The sky had turned velvet black. 
The stars were out : unwinking bril- 
liants set in the velvet. The ship was 
forty miles high; it was traveling 
almost 15,000 miles per hour. 

Third-stage pressures were al- 
most unnoticeable. They never 
climbed above three 

They broke into sunlight. His 
dazzled eyes squeezed shut against 
the sudden pain, swifter than the 
metal covers that slid over the cano- 
py to protect it from the massive, 
unfiltered irradiation of the sun’s 
ultraviolet that otherwise would 
soon discolor and cloud it. 

Afterimages danced in front of 
Amos’s eyes, lasted for minutes. Be- 
fore they faded, the motors cut out. 
The net released him completely, 
the seat cushion shoved, the harness 
caught him again . 

But he was falling, hurtling 
downward from a tremendous cliff, 
tumbling helplessly and unchecked 
into infinite depths . 

He clawed at the chair arms, 
gripped them until the veins stood 
out, ropy and blue, in the whiteness. 
His breath sucked in, rasping. He 
held it, every muscle braced for the 

HOAX 



impact ... 

That never came. The pit was 
bottomless. 

It was illusion! The fall reflex. 
Babies have it; kittens, lowered sud- 
denly, claw wildly for support. 

He was falling, he told himself. 
He was falling away from the 
Earth, coasting upwards at more 
than 18,000 miles per hour, without 
that resistance to ffie puU of gravity 
which conveys a sensation of weight. 

Slowly he let his breath sigh out. 
Slowly he relaxed stubbornly re- 
sisting muscles. He let himself fall. 

He opened his eyes and looked 
up, seeing the seats and helmets 
above him. For a moment it helped, 
and then his gravi-receptors told 
him that this was illusion — ^there 
was no up, no down. He was falling 
in all directions at once. 

The cabin was spinning around 
him. He fought the sensation, 
fought the feeling of nausea that 
gripped his throat and stomach. 
His face perspired, grew cold. A 
moment later he was violently sick 
in the plastic bag. 

It was almost half an hour before 
the spasms ceased. 

Dimly, through his agony, he 
heard voices: 

“Fuel reserve . 

“Skin temperature one thou- 
sand . .” 

“Velocity eighteen thousand 
four . .” 

“Altitude . .” 

“Cocoa. Check flight path . .” 

“On the straight and narrow, 
Folly . .” 

“Check. Keep us posted will 
you? Let’s make this a nice easy 
ride — ^papa’s tired.”

H eat was a problem. By the 
time the third-stage left the 
last, thin traces of atmosphere be- 
hind, the temperature of the hull 
was 1,000° F. 

The refrigeration equipment, 
massive enough to cool a ten-story 
office building, labored to keep the 
cabin livable. It took four hours for 
the ship to reach equilibrium 
temperature. 

The crew couldn’t sit back and 
sweat it out. They had jobs to do. 
In coasting to the 1,075-mile alti- 
tude, the ship had dropped below 
orbital speed. Between them, by star 
sights and computations, the navi- 
gator and co-pilot determined the 
ship’s altitude. The captain pressed 
a button on the arm of his chair. 
Slowly the pattern of stars shifted 
over the canopy. 

Once more the captain pressed 
the firing button. The ship gained 
a little more than 1,000 miles per 
hour. 

They were in orbit. 

The captain spoke to the Dough- 
nut: “Ess one point two. Folly. In 
orbit but blind. Give us a hand,” 
The radio was silent. 
“Doughnut!” the captain roared. 
“Get your finger out! Give us a 
bearing!” 

“Folly. Ess one point two. Thanks 
for the outburst. Gave us radio 
bearing. We now have visual. Fol- 
lowing are corrections . .” 

Amos hugged to himself the 
meaning of S.1.2; it was a mark of 
belonging, and at the moment it 
was all he had. The “S” stood for 
satellite, the “1” for the orbit, the 
“2” for the second satellite in that 
orbit. 

\2 



The S.1.1 was McMillen’s tomb, 
leading the Doughnut by one hun- 
dred miles. 

With the setting of the sun, the 
shades had been rolled back from 
the canopy. The ship was in the 
shadow of the Earth. Amos stared 
into the star-speckled sky for his 
first glimpse of the Doughnut, but 
the night draped it with invisibility. 

It wasn’t like the model that had 
hung above his bed; it didn’t glow. 

“. and welcome back. Colonel,” 
said the voice from the Doughnut. 

The captain growled and gave 
the ship a gentle boost. Slowly it 
began to flip over. 

Beneath them — above them — the 
night-dark Earth appeared and 
swept across the canopy and gave 
way again to the stars. In that 
glimpse Amos saw the reddish glow 
of a city and a star-brightness near 
it that swept away before he could 
identify it. He fought back nausea; 
terror whispered that he was one of 
those unfortunates who never got 
over their spacesickness. 

The cruising motor turned on 
again briefly. Weight and fall again. 
The tumbling stopped, Amos took a 
deep, relieved breath. Framed in 
the canopy now, drawing the eyes 
like a vision of heaven, was the 
gently spinning wheel of the 
Doughnut, one great spoke con- 
necting the rim of the wheel, bulg- 
ing to a hub in the middle. 

It was there at last, barely visible, 
gleaming dully in the starlight. 
Amos forgot his nausea. 

It had been a long way to come: 
twenty years of dreams and five 
years of hell and a thousand miles 
— straight up. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




“If you’re going over,” the cap- 
tain said, close, sarcastic, “I’d ad- 
vise you to slip into something a 
little warmer. Otherwise you might 
find the last few feet the hardest.” 

He floated past. Amos hated him. 
Hated his sarcasm. 

Cautiously he released his harness 
straps, holding desperately to the 
chair arm to keep from falling. It 
was no use trying to fool his gravi- 
receptors and mechano-receptors; 
they knew he was falling. 

Slowly, trying to control his nau- 
sea, he floated above the ladder, 
puUing himself along it until he 
reached the rack of pressure suits. 
Clinging to a stanchion and strug- 
gling to fit his legs into the proper 
places was a far different experi- 
ence than when his 150 pounds had 
been solid and maneuverable at the 
Academy. Finally he slipped his legs 
in and wedged one arm far enough 
down a sleeve to grab the hand con- 
trols. 

When he had the other arm in a 
sleeve, the captain was already 
dressed. He floated over impatiently 
to help with the fastenings and low- 
er the helmet over Amos’s head. 

“Radio working?” The voice was 
loud and harsh inside the suit. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Good. Check your suit.” 

Amos stared at the face dimly 
visible through two face-plates of 
dark glass. The complete check took 
a good five minutes, and the suits 
were thoroughly inspected after and 
before every trip. “Yes, sir,” he said 
grimly. 

Step by step, joint by joint, gauTO 
by gauge, control by control, attacn- 
ment by attachment, he went 

HOAX 



through the suit-check manual. 
“Suit check complete, sir.” 

The captain turned curtly, swing- 
ing himself by a hook around a 
stanchion, and caught the air-lock 
controls. By the time the outer door 
opened in front of them, bulky 
stevedores were dumping boxes and 
crates and tubes out of the cargo 
compartment. The ship and the 
three taxis hitched to one broad 
wing were anchors for a vast spider 
web of cords and safety lines. 

Amos looked up into infinity. 
Slowly the ship tilted; infinity was 
a dark mouth gaping; he was fall- 
ing .. 

He grabbed for the edge of the 
doorway. Where his hands should 
have been, tools banged against the 
hull of the ship. The impact threw 
him forward, arms flailing helpless- 

ly- 

As he cleared the side of the ship. 
Earth swimg into view beneath. His 
orientation twisted. Panic was a live 
thing in his chest and throat, flut- 
tering icy wings. He was really fall- 
ing now, falling helplessly and end- 
lessly toward death. 

He fell through impalpable space 
unable to tear his fascinated eyes 
away from the dark Earth below. 
Something was clanging against his 
suit, but it was seconds before he 
could look to see what it was. The 
captain was clinging to the handle 
on the chest of his suit. 

Something clicked against his 
waist. The captain released him, 
swung around, began to recede. 

“Wait — !” Amos began, fear dis- 
torting his voice, and then he saw 
that a nylon safety line trailed from 

13 




him to the captain. 

The ship was only a few yards 
away. The captain pulled himself to 
it by his own line and snapped 
Amos’s cord onto a ring beside the 
air-lock door. Slowly he reeled 
Amos in like a clumsy metal fish. 

“Elementary lesson number one,” 
the captain said in a bored, un- 
pleasant voice, “the moment you 
reach space: clip on.” 

“Sorry, sir,” Amos said, his suit 
dripping inside with sweat. 

“That’s a word we don’t have 
much use for out here. You seldom 
live to use it. There’s your trans- 
portation.” He pointed to one of the 
nearby sausages. “Jump!” 

Amos hesitated before the blank 
immensity that separated him from 
the taxi. Then he closed his eyes 
and jumped, his safety line unreel- 
ing behind. Twice he missed and 
had to haul himself ignominiously 
back. On the third try, he caught a 
hook in the handle on the nose of 
the little two-man ship and clung. 

The captain released his safety 
line. It disappeared into the reel at 
Amos’s waist. 

A round door opened out for 
Amos. He slipped carefully into the 
taxi and crawled past the suited 
pilot to the seat behind. 

As Amos buckled himself down, 
the pilot turned awkwardly in the 
starlight coming through the cano- 
py and touched his helmet to 
Amos’s. “If your radio’s on, turn it 
off.” 

The words echoed hollowly. 
Amos pressed the button under his 
left index finger. “It’s off,” he said 
curiously. 

“Good. Privacy’s hard enough to 

14 



come by up here. No use broadcast- 
ing everything, eh? My name’s Ko- 
vac. Lieutenant Max Kovac. You’re 
new, aren’t you?” 

“That’s right. Cadet Amos Dan- 
ton.” 

“Glad to meet you, Amos. You 
don’t know how glad. One more 
like you, and I get rotated. Then, 
watch out, fleshpots!” 

“You been here long?” 

“Twelve long months, brother. 
That’s twelve years by any other 
calendar. Just let me get my feet 
back on the ground, and they 
couldn’t drag me out again with a 
team of wild rockets. Excuse me, 
Amos. We’re being paged.” 

From the Hub of the Doughnut 
came a brilliant spot of light. The 
taxi jockeyed sickeningly back and 
forth on its two jets until it was 
aimed at the station and then the 
rear jet came on full. The Dough- 
nut swelled in front of them like a 
balloon, spinning. With a single 
correction, Kovac slipped the taxi 
into one of the motionless, cagelike 
landing berths at either side of the 
Hub killing his forward speed with 
a brief flare of the nose motor. Amos 
followed Kovac into the turret, his 
heart beating swiftly, expectantly. 

Beyond the air lock was the Hub. 
Suits hung in brackets around the 
curving wall like gleaming white 
monsters. He was inside the Dough- 
nut, Amos thought, spinning with 
it, a part of it. He was here. 

Amos released his helmet clamps 
and took a deep breath of the 
Doughnut’s air. It smelled like a 
machine shop inside a bathhouse. 
It stank. 

Kovac was already out of his suit. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




He helped Amos, saying easily, 
“Don’t let it bother you, kid. It’s 
tough your first time out. You can’t 
coordinate because your muscles 
and senses are still adjusted to 
gravity. Everybody goes through it. 
You’ll get the knack. Just don’t let 
anybody kid you. At first we’re all 
babies learning to walk.” 

He slipped the suit and helmet 
into an empty bracket. “Come on,” 
he said, launching himself toward 
one tunnel like a champion diver. 
He caught the landing net that 
lined one curving wall and pulled 
his mouth close to a microphone. 
“Weight control. Kovac coming in 
on B with new arrival Cadet Amos 
Danton. One-fifty?” he asked, 
gauging Amos’s size. 

Amos nodded. After a moment a 
bored voice said, “Okay, you’re 
balanced.” 

They pulled themselves along the 
net, their weight slowly increasing, 
their bodies swinging gradually 
down toward the rim until, when 
they reached the little weight-con- 
trol office, they were hanging from 
the net. 

Amos weighed forty pounds. 

In front of a compact computer 
and a schematic of the Doughnut 
dotted with small, magnetic mark- 
ers sat an officer in wrinkled, khaki 
coveralls. “Danton?” he said, rais- 
ing an eyebrow in cursory acknowl- 
edgment. “Welcome aboard, suck- 
er.” 

His face straightened as he stood 
up quickly, saluting. “Welcome 
back, Colonel.” 

Someone brushed past Amos and 
turned, stripping off his flight hel- 
met. It was the captain of the Folly, 

HOAX 



his hair a grizzled spacecut. “Dan- 
ton, eh?” he said sourly. “Let me 
know when you’re ready to go back 
in.” He stooped through a doorway 
and was gone. 

The weight given him by the 
Doughnut’s spin had made Amos’s 
empty, aching stomach feel better, 
but now it felt like it had a brick in 
it. 

How can a man dream so long, 
he thought desperately, and have 
the reality turn out so horribly? 

With his helmet off, the captain 
of the Folly was unmistakable. He 
was Colonel Frank Pickrell, com- 
mander of the Doughnut. 



G eneral finch had been 

right: the selection and the 
training was never enough ; the job 
was bigger than the man; what 
Amos had gone through was noth- 
ing to what was waiting for him. 

To Amos it seemed that he had 
never been trained at all; he had 
to learn everything all over again. 
Nothing could have prepared him 
for no-weight. Nothing could have 
prepared him for the fierce, blazing 
reality of the sun, for the Earth like 
a giant, round picture framed in 
white haze and spanning half the 
field of vision, for the everyday dis- 
comforts of life aboard the Dough- 
nut. 

There were never enough men 
for the jobs that had to be done if 
they were to justify the expense and 
sacrifice of putting the Doughnut 
into space and maintaining it there. 
The work day was 14 to 16 hours 
long, back-breaking, physical labor 
done under the most imcomfort- 

15 




able, most dangerous conditions 
men could endure and still stay 
sane. 

There was never enough space 
inside the Doughnut even for es- 
sentials. If it was a question of func- 
tion or comfort, comfort lost. 
Amos’s bunk was his for eight hours 
out of every twenty-four. The two 
other shifts were alloted to two 
other men. 

He would crawl into the bunk 
and lie there, too weary to sleep, 
and wonder if he would survive. 
There were times he was so home- 
sick for the feel and look and smell 
of Earth that he cried into the thin 
pillow, pressing his face deep to 
muffle the sobs. There were times 
he would have sold his chance of 
promotion for ten hours of unin- 
terrupted sleep. There were mo- 
ments he almost screamed for the 
lost privilege of a few minutes com- 
pletely alone. 

None of these were possible unless 
he gave up the dream. And that was 
the unthinkable. There were fleet- 
ing moments he would tell himself 
that this was fulfillment; he was 
out there at last — out there in the 
Doughnut — out with his dreams. So 
it meant privation and drudgery 
and psychological starvation — he 
was out there, and it was wonderful. 

It wasn’t often he could convince 
himself. Because this wasn’t his 
dream. 

He was given twenty-four hours 
to acclimate himself, but it was 
seven days before he could keep 
down solids. Specialized personnel 
held down an extra job in main- 
tenance when their regular shift 
was over, but Amos’s specialty was 

16 



piloting, and he wasn’t trusted with 
a ship. He also knew navigation, en- 
gineering, and communications, but 
these, too, were out of the question. 
He was assigned to the permanent 
labor force. He was a janitor, a 
stevedore, a handyman. 

There was little dust. The air- 
conditioning plant extracted the 
dirt and lint men brought with 
them from Earth, but Amos 
emptied wastebaskets, washed fin- 
gerprints off dials, screens, and 
viewports, scrubbed washrooms, 
polished brass . He answered all 
calls for working parties; at least 
once a day he went out to unload 
a ferry and push the freight to the 
waiting taxis. In his spare time, he 
maintained the temperature regula- 
tors. 

This was a perpetual chore that 
kept him clinging to the meteor- 
bumper of the Doughnut for a 
minimum of six hours a day as he 
unscrewed the shutterlike regulators 
with the tools at the sleeve end of 
his suit and fastened a renovated 
regulator in its place. 

A week in the S.1.2, and Amos 
began to forget that he had ever 
known another life. A week : 84 re- 
volutions of the Earth around the 
Doughnut; 84 sunrises, 84 sunsets, 
84 nights. 

Food became less a task, more a 
gripe. Nausea came less frequently 
and almost .never reached the active 
stage. Strength returned unnoticed. 
Life became less a torment, more a 
drudgery. By the same token, it 
became less a dream, more a cold 
reality. 

Amos fought it. 



JAMES E. GUNN 




There were men to envy in the 
Doughnut, the observers and the 
scientists : physicists, aerologists, 

astro-physicists, astronomer . 
They were doing what they wanted 
to do in the best possible place to do 
it. 

Amos moved through the Dough- 
nut, cleaning, watching, telling 
himself that this was the dream. 

For the physicists, conditions 
were available that had been un- 
attainable or attainable only with 
great effort: weightlessness, virtual- 
ly perfect vacuums, temperatures 
approaching absolute zero . The 
physicists were in a state of per- 
petual excitation, like their cosmic 
ray counters and ionization cham- 
bers. 

Underneath the radio ops were 
the aerologists and the slowly un- 
raveling mystery of weather, seen 
now from above and outside. 
Weather had never been so pre- 
dictable. 

Next came the observers, pre- 
empting two decks for their maps 
and telescopic enlargements, staring 
at closely guarded items of military 
interest. They reminded Amos of 
pathologists staring through micro- 
scopes at viruses and germs and 
cancer cells — only the things under 
the lens knew they were being ob- 
served and acted accordingly. 

Beyond the computer and the 
telescope control panel was Celestial 
Observation, two decks tall, where 
photographs of distant nebulae 
were projected for study. A few 
hundred feet from the Doughnut, a 
free-floating telescope was taking 
the finest celestial photographs man 
had ever seen, free from the distor- 

HOAX 



tions of a wavering blanket of air. 

But, in a sense quite apart from 
their civilian status, the scientists 
were a class distinct from the Air 
Force officers and cadets who 
manned the Doughnut. The scien- 
tists had never left Earth. 

For them the S.1.2 was an end in 
itself, created especially to serve 
their purposes. It existed as a plat- 
form on which to stand as they 
looked up or down or performed 
their specialized experiments. 

But Amos knew it was only a 
means, the first of a series of steps 
that led up to the moon, the 
planets, and the stars. 

The scientists had come out into 
space to look back at Earth. Amos 
had come out to reach the stars. 

That was the dream. 



T he thirtieth day, one 

month: Amos was in the Hub, 
weightless, stealing moments from 
sleep to practice doggedly the eso- 
teric techniques of movement with- 
out the aid of semi-circular canals 
and otolith organs. He was climb- 
ing out of a suit when the loud- 
speaker said, “Cadet Danton. Re- 
port to Colonel Pickrell. Cadet . .” 
In the middle of the A spoke, 
Amos passed Kovac. The lieutenant 
gave him a wink and an encourag- 
ing smile. “Don’t let him make you 
mad, boy,” he whispered. “The Fish 
is a cold and calculating man!” 
Amos smiled briefly. 

Across the airtight door was 
printed : COMMANDER. Amos 
pressed the buzzer. The door swung 
open toward him. Pickrell stood 
behind it, his face set and hard. 

17 




“Don’t stand there like a fool,” 
he said. “Come in.” 

“Yes, sir.” Amos clenched his 
teeth and stooped through the door- 
way. 

The cabin wasn’t much bigger 
than a closet and not much better 
furnished. Like Pickrell, it was cold, 
gray, austere, built not for appear- 
ance or comfort but for efficiency. 
The only furniture was a bunk, a 
thin, one-legged table, and a chair; 
when folded flat against the wall, 
they left a walking space of almost 
six feet square. 

The aluminum table was let 
down. Pickrell slid behind it into 
the chair. “It cost over one thou- 
sand dollars in propellants alone to 
get you out here,” he said flatly. 
“I’m ready to write that off. I’m 
not even concerned about the five 
hundred dollars a day it takes to 
maintain you out here. But you’re 
taking up space a good man might 
fill. I’m sending you back in the 
next empty seat.” 

“Why?” The word was expelled 
from Amos. 

“Some men have the equipment 
for this kind of life. You aren’t one 
of them. You’ve been sick, haven’t 
you?” 

“Once in a while,” Amos ad- 
mitted. 

“There’s no such thing as space- 
sickness. It’s fear. We don’t have 
room out here for cowards.” 

“What have you got against me. 
Colonel? You had it in for me the 
moment I stepped aboard the ferry. 
What is it: hate, fear, jealousy? 
I’m doing my work. If I had a 
chance I’d do more. Give me that 
chance. Colonel! Don’t send me 

18 



back before I — His hands were 
wet. He looked down. Blood was 
trickling from the holes his finger- 
nails had cut into his palms. 

“I’ll tell you what I’ve got against 
you, Danton: you’ve got stars in 
your eyes. This isn’t a job to you; 
it’s a game. I know your kind; I’ve 
seen too many of you. You want to 
go on out. You gripe about the 
Air Force marking time on the 
moon project or the Mars ship or 
the Venus expedition. I’ll tell you 
something, Danton : this is no glory 
road. This satellite is out here to 
look back on Earth, not out at the 
stars. But you’ll never get that 
through your head. You’re danger- 
ous. You’ll kill yourself. That I 
don’t care about. But the chances 
are dangerously great that you’ll 
take the rest of us with you. And 
that’s my business. 

“Get out your nice, new space- 
pack, Danton. You’re going in.” 

Amos stood stiffly in front of the 
desk, feeling unreal, looking down 
at the salt-and-pepper spacecut 
with the bald spot at the crown. 
But for Pickrell, Danton had ceased 
to exist. 

Amos turned and pushed through 
the airtight door and let it pull shut 
behind him. This was the way it 
ended. This was the bursting of the 
dream. To destroy it took nothing 
as powerful or as dramatic as a 
meteor. A word pierced it, and it 
collapsed. 

But worse than that was the 
change in Pickrell. This wasn’t the 
man he had idolized. This wasn’t 
the hero, the second man out. This 
wasn’t the man who had stood in 

JAMES E. GUNN 




the cabin of Rev McMillen’s ship 
and stared down at the frozen body 
of the man who had led the way out 
and got lost in the cave of night, 
his fuel exhausted. This wasn’t the 
man who had broadcast to the 
world from 1,000 miles up: 

“In accordance with my instruc- 
tions and his own wishes, his body 
will be left here in its eternal or- 
bit .. 

“From this moment, let this be 
his shrine, sacred to all the genera- 
tions of spacemen, inviolate. And 
let it be a symbol that Man’s dreams 
can be realized, but sometimes the 
price is steep . 

Pickrell had changed, surely, not 
the dream. He had grown old and 
used up, and the dream was too 
much for him. 

And in his hands was the future 
of space flight. 

The dream was betrayed. 

Tears stung Amos’s eyes. He 
blinked rapidly to keep them back. 
Tears weren’t manly, but there are 
times when even a man must weep. 

When his eyes cleared, he was 
inside the Hub, and the idea was 
complete. 

Pickrell could send him home 
like a boy who has been naughty at 
school. Pickrell could break his 
heart. That was Pickrell’s right; he 
was the Commander. But he 
couldn’t send Amos home until 
Amos had one chance to do what 
he had been trained to do. 

It took only seconds to get into a 
suit. Amos pulled up the zippers, 
pulled down the helmet, clamped 
it to the suit. He refilled the oxygen 
tanks at the petcock against the 
wall. He selected a hand rocket 



from the rack and slipped through 
the air lock and out the turret. 

It was night; the Earth swam 
nearby, circling around him, giant 
and dark. 

When he released the landing- 
berth cage, centrifugal force threw 
him gently away on a tangent. His 
stomach sank: he was completely 
on his own. There were no cords 
connected to anything: no um- 
bilical cord, no apron string, no 
safety line. 

He spun slowly. The Doughnut 
swung into view ; the sausage- 
shaped taxis were hitched along the 
inner edge of the wheel. He could 
have reached them by the spoke, 
but that took time. It was all he 
had, and there was little left . 

He was going to miss the rim. He 
swiveled the hand rocket to one side 
and gave it a cautious, one-second 
burst. It shoved him toward the 
rim, but it made him spin more 
rapidly. 

Quickly he turned the rocket in 
the opposite direction and let it 
push until his spin had stopped. 
Then he was spinning the other 
way, faster now. Panic gripped his 
throat; he couldn’t swallow. 

How long did a hand rocket last? 
He couldn’t remember, but once the 
fuel was exhausted, he had lost all 
chance of helping himself. 

He closed his eyes to shut out the 
vast, pancake disk of the Earth 
flipping crazily over and over; he 
tried to think. All he could remem- 
ber was his Academy instructor 
saying, “Keep it against your belly 
button! Belly button, I said!” 

That was it. All force had to be 
exerted through his center of grav- 

19 



HOAX 




ity — ^roughly the navel — or it 
created spin. 

He opened his eyes, swung the 
rocket to the right, and gave it a 
flicker of a burst. His spin slowed. 
Another flicker. His spin almost 
stopped. That was good enough, be- 
cause the rim of the giant wheel 
was only two arm-lengths away. 
When he was faced away from the 
Doughnut, he pressed the rocket to 
his navel and fired briefly. 

As he passed the rim, he caught 
the line of a taxi with one hook and 
let himself slide along it imtil the 
taxi stopped him. Its hydrazine and 
nitric acid gauges stood at only half 
full. 

He took a deep breath and 
launched himself toward the next 
taxi in line. This time his reaction 
flight was perfect. One burst turned 
him to face the taxi, a second, in 
the opposite direction, stopped his 
rotation, a third killed his forward 
speed. 

This one had just been refueled. 

Amos unsnapped the hitching 
line and let the taxi drift tangential- 
ly away from the Doughnut. He was 
weightless, but he had a ship under 
him. He had power. He had a goal. 

Before the chance was gone, he 
was going to pay a final tribute to 
a dream. He was going to visit the 
icy tomb of Rev McMillen. 



T he tomb was in the same 
orbit as the Doughnut, but one 
hundred miles ahead. 

He had to head in the right di- 
rection, where there was no simple 
method of determining direction. 
He had to compute distance 

20 



traveled, where even fully equipped 
ships found that difficult. He had 
to increase speed, when every in- 
crease in speed meant an increase in 
altitude. 

And if he strayed off course by 
just a few minutes of a degree at 
the start, he would be miles from 
his goal at the end. 

There were no instruments in the 
taxi, no built-in octants, no patent 
logs, no computers . Taxis were 
built for short hauls when both 
ends of the journey were always in 
view. Two gunsight telescopes were 
fixed immovably at eye level, one 
pointing straight forward, the other 
straight back. The controls were 
crude: two sticks, one at each side 
of the pilot’s chair, firing the front 
and the rear rockets, which swiveled 
within a limited arc in response to 
the movement of the sticks. The 
throttles were buttons on top of the 
sticks. 

The taxi was roughly horizontal 
and spinning gently. The Earth 
tipped lazily around the canopy, 
chased by the flat, black-velvet cur- 
tain of the night hung with its 
small, unblinking lanterns. The 
stars were alien. Where was he? 

The Earth rolled around him, the 
continents and oceans sliding down 
across the disk: the dark, familiar 
shape of Cuba, Florida sliding 
south. That meant the Doughnut 
was on its northern leg of the orbit 
that reached as far north as Nonie, 
as far south as Little America on 
the Antarctic continent. 

The stars snapped into place. 
There was the Big Dipper. And 
there — indicated most beautifully 
by the Pointers — ^was Polaris. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




He drew dividends on his long 
labor of memorizing the Doughnut’s 
timetable: in five minutes, by the 
taxi’s chronometer, the Pole Star 
would make an angle with the orbit 
of — he figured quickly — 430. 

Amos killed the taxi’s spin and 
placed his horizontal axis parallel 
with the Doughnut’s orbital plane — 
as near as he could estimate the 
angle. He could think of only one 
way to check altitude; he dropped 
the taxi’s nose until the forward 
sight nicked the Earth’s horizon. 

Instead of a pilot’s suit with its 
specialized manipulators, he had a 
handyman’s sleeve-end tools. He 
held the right-hand control stick 
firmly in a pair of pliers and poised 
a screwdriver above the throttle 
button — and hesitated. 

Rocketing one-hundred miles by 
the seat of his suit was a desperate 
gamble : there are no railroad tracks 
in space. There was sacrilege in it, 
too, but Amos shrugged that away. 
No shrine has ever been profaned 
by an honest worshipper. 

His jaw tightened. The danger 
didn’t matter. The dream was dy- 
ing; there would be no other 
chance. 

He pressed the throttle button. 
The accelerometer climbed quickly 
to one g; he held it there for ten 
seconds. When he released the 
throttle, he had added roughly four 
miles a minute to his velocity. He 
had used up — he checked the in- 
strument panel quickly — two-tenths 
of his fuel supply. The nose of the 
taxi was still pointed at the horizon. 

At 2103 the sun rose, flashing 
blindingly on the nose of the taxi. 

At 21 16 Amos passed over Nome, 

HOAX 



his first check point. 

At 21 19 Amos checked to see that 
the forward sight was still bisecting 
the horizon and pressed the left 
throttle button for ten seconds after 
the accelerometer reached one g. 

Given well-matched motors, his 
increase in speed and altitude were 
canceled. He should be back in 
orbit within sight of McMillen’s 
tomb. 

He turned slowly to scan the en- 
tire field of vision, ignoring the glare 
of the sun, fierce against his eyes 
as he looked back. 

There was no stage-three in view. 

He had failed. There was no use 
searching a cubic area of space that 
might be hundreds of miles in 
volume. Head back, fool! he 
thought. If you can get back — and 
I wouldn^t bet a used sick-bag on it. 

Cubic, he thought. Cubic. 

Recklessly, he tumbled the taxi 
over on its back. For a moment the 
glare from the polar ice cap blinded 
him, then he saw it. 

To the right, three or four miles 
away, it gleamed in the sun; high- 
lights ran along one wing and down 
the cone-shaped hull. 

Expertly, Amos killed the tum- 
bling and centered the stage-three 
in his front sights; he poured on the 
fuel. The ship swelled but not as 
quickly as the exultation that filled 
his throat, hard, choking. He 
blasted to a stop, careless of fuel. 

McMillen’s tomb hung a few feet 
away, its air-lock door gaping open 
to invite him in. 

He didn’t move for a moment. 
He sat quite still for a few seconds, 
trying to savor the moment, trying 

21 




to analyze his emotions. They were 
too complex; he gave it up. 

As he crawled out the port, he 
snapped his safety line onto the taxi. 
For an instant, holding himself to 
the taxi, he studied the opening op- 
posite him. Then he dived for it, 
kicking the taxi back. 

He hit glancingly against the 
open door, caught the jamb with 
one hook, and pulled himself in. As 
the taxi reached the end of the 
safety line, it tried to tug him away, 
but he had a good hold. Bracing his 
feet on each side of the doorway, he 
reeled in the taxi until it was tight 
against the ship. He turned. The 
inner air-lock ^or was open. 

He hesitated, thinking about 
what he would find inside, and real- 
ity began to edit his dreams. 

He had thought of McMillen sit- 
ting in the captain’s chair, staring 
out through the canopy toward the 
stars he had brought within man’s 
reach, a rueful smile frozen upon 
his face, his body perfectly pre- 
served by the chill airlessness of 
space. 

It wouldn’t be like that at all. 

If the ship had ever had a 
ceramic coating, micro-meteorites 
had scoured the metal clean years 
ago. The hull temperature was 
more than 800° F. That was no 
deep freeze. 

Amos had seen pictures of ex- 
plosive decompression. If these air- 
lock doors had been opened quickly, 
McMillen wouldn’t be in one piece. 
If, on the other hand, the air had 
leaked out slowly, his body fluids 
would have started boiling when the 
air pressure reached six percent of 
sea level, the blood in the lungs 

22 



evaporating, blood ballooning un- 
der the skin . 

It was no picture for a dreamer. 
Amos straightened his shoulders in- 
side his suit, feeling older, as if he 
had lost something and would lose 
more. He drifted through the inner 
doorway and hooked a girder to 
pull himself toward the nose of the 
ship. 

Under the canopy, he caught 
himself by another exposed girder, 
his eyes puzzled, his face wrinkled 
in an effort to understand. 

The interior of the ship was only 
a shell. There were no seats, no 
instruments, no inside sheathing. 
There had been no shutters for the 
canopy; ultraviolet had turned it 
almost completely opaque; micro- 
meteorites had etched it. 

There was no pilot, no hero 
named McMillen. There never had 
been. No one had ever planned for 
any. 

The only useful object in the shell 
was a compact radio transmitter 
bolted to a girder. Attached to it 
was a tape recorder with an over- 
sized reel. The tape had run out. 

It had been a hoax. The great 
epic of man’s first flight into space, 
the magnificence of Earth’s re- 
sponse to his plea for help — it had 
all been false. The contributions 
that had made the Doughnut possi- 
ble had been tricked from a credu- 
lous American people. 

Amos clung to the girder and 
grew old. The orange protective 
coating had never even been 
painted over. Amos scratched at it 
until the steel gleamed through: 
DREAMS END HERE. 

Coldly he pushed away. He 

JAMES E. GUNN 




swung back through the air-lock 
door and crawled into the taxi. His 
movements sent it floating away 
from the ship. 

Icily he computed his return. He 
had spent more than half of his 
fuel and almost half of his oxygen. 

Ten minutes later Polaris became 
visible. A ten-second blast from the 
forward motor slowed the taxi. He 
waited for the Doughnut to catch 
up. ^ 

A little over twenty-five minutes 
later, he speeded up again, and the 
needle of the fuel gauge tapped 
against the zero peg. He released 
the throttle button and looked up. 

The Doughnut hung above him. 

For the first time, he turned on 
his radio receiver. Immediately, it 
burst into speech: “Danton! Give 
us some indication of your position. 
If your radio is working, answer so 
that we can get a bearing. We can’t 
send out searching parties until . .” 

Amos flipped it off, aimed the 
taxi at the Doughnut, and touched 
the throttle of the right-hand stick. 
The motor coughed, just once. It 
was enough. The ship floated gently 
toward the ring. Amos crawled out, 
caught a line as he passed, and 
snapped the taxi to it. 

He hit the landing berth with his 
first try. 

When he came into the Hub, 
Kovac was climbing into a suit. He 
stopped, one leg drifting sideways, 
and stared incredulously at Amos. 
“Where in the — ? My God, man, 
you’ve got the whole Doughnut in 
a—!” 

“Took a joy ride,” Amos said, re- 
leasing his helmet and stripping off 
the suit. He gave a short, mirthless 

HOAX 



laugh. “Joy ride! The Colonel is 
sending me in.” 

“Sending you in my chilblained 
foot! You gave him cause!” He 
drifted closer, glancing at the near- 
by microphones. “Didn’t you under- 
stand me? As long as a man obeys 
instructions and does the work as- 
signed him with any degree of com- 
petence, the Fish can’t send him in. 
They took away that power ; he was 
sending in too many men. You had 
to let him ride you into making a 
break!” 

“I was a sucker,” Amos agreed 
flatly. “I guess I always have been.” 

He dived for spoke B and pulled 
himself quickly along the landing 
net. “I’m back,” he threw at the 
weight-control officer as he passed. 
Wide-eyed, the lieutenant spun 
quickly to his phone. 

Amos made his way, unhurried, 
to the cramped, communal sleeping 
quarters for rim B personnel and 
slipped into his bunk and lay there, 
his hands under his head, staring 
at the smooth bulge of the bunk 
above. 

Two minutes later Colonel Pick- 
rell arrived. 



T he low overhead forced him 
to bend his neck. He glowered 
at Amos. “Danton — ” he began. 

“Excuse my not getting up, Colo- 
nel,” Amos said, “but there isn’t 
room for two of us between the 
bunks. If I’d known you wanted to 
see me. I’d have come to your 
room.” 

Pickrell tried to straighten up, 
couldn’t. “All right — everybody but 
Danton, out of here!” 

23 




The bunks emptied swiftly. Men 
grabbed their clothes and squeezed 
past Pickrell, glancing backwards 
curiously. When they were alone, 
Pickrell sat stiffly on the edge of the 
bunk across the narrow aisle. Amos 
didn’t look at him. 

“All right, Danton, let’s have it.” 
“Have what. Colonel?” 

Pickrell stared at him icily. “The 
explanation for stealing a taxi. For 
absenting yourself from your post.” 
“I borrowed the taxi. It’s been 
returned. You can deduct the cost 
of the fuel from my pay.” 

“Thanks,” Pickrell said sarcas- 
tically. “But maybe we should let 
the courtmartial decide that.” 

“As for absenting myself — I was 
on my off-shift, just as I am now. 
What I choose to do with my off- 
time is my own affair.” 

“Ridiculous! There are specific 
instructions against the unauthor- 
ized use of equipment for personal 
reasons. Where did you go?” 

Amos turned his head and met 
Pickrell’s eyes squarely. “I took a 
little trip,” he said gently. “I visited 
McMillen’s tomb.” 

“You’re mad!” 

Amos looked back at the bunk 
above him. 

“You couldn’t possibly get thiere 
in a taxi,” Pickrell continued sharp- 
ly. “Without instruments, without 
radio bearings! And if you got 
there, you couldn’t possibly get 
back.” 

Amos lay motionless, his hands 
under his head, uncaring. 

“You’re lying,” Pickrell said. 
Amos looked at him again, at the 
blue-agate eyes in the hard, weath- 
ered face. The lenses had several 

24 



tiny cataracts. “Why did you do 
it?” he asked. “Why did you do it 
that way?” 

Pickrell’ s eyebrows almost met. 
“You were there,” he muttered, dis- 
belief lingering in his voice. “Fan- 
tastic! I wouldn’t trust myself to 
come back from a trip like that.” 
“Hoax!” Amos said. 

Pickrell took a deep breath and 
let it sigh out. “Yes,” he said, “the 
ship was empty. McMillen wasn’t 
in it. He wasn’t the first man into 
space. He didn’t die there. The mes- 
sages back — all planned, all taped. 
Why did it happen that way? To 
understand you’d have to be one of 
us, back in 1957.” 

Amos didn’t look at him. What 
Pickrell said didn’t matter. There 
were no reasons good enough. 

“We couldn’t get the money,” 
Pickrell said. His eyes seemed to be 
seeing something a long way off. 
“That was the only thing we 
needed — the money. We used all 
we had — government money, our 
own; it wasn’t enough. We built a 
ship. We slaved on it. But we 
couldn’t finish it. By stripping the 
third stage to a shell, we could put 
a payload of only one hundred 
pounds into an orbit. 

“I don’t remember now who sug- 
gested the idea — maybe it was Mc- 
Millen himself. But it was the an- 
swer. We all knew it. We couldn’t 
put McMillen up here really be- 
cause we were the only ones with 
the imagination to see what space 
flight could mean. So we pre- 
tended.” He made a sweeping ges- 
ture that included the satellite and 
everything it entailed and meant. 
“None of us has ever regretted it.” 

JAMES E. GUNN 




Amos looked at him silently. 

“But we didn’t want it that way. 
We could put a man out here, you 
see — except for the money. So we 
got the money the only way we 
knew how. And we put men out 
here. That’s what counts. That’s 
our justification. We didn’t want it 
this way, but we’ve never been sor- 
ry we did it.” 

“I’m so glad,” Amos said softly. 
Pickrell turned fierce eyes on him. 
“None of us is happy about it — 
understand that! Bo isn’t. He was 
the last one we convinced; he was 
the one who really put it over, and 
it’s killing him. McMillen isn’t. 
Who wants to be a hero when 
you’re only a fake hero and you’re 
alive to know it? Do you know who 
was the first man into space? Me,” 
Amos chuckled. “And the honor 
belongs to a living ghost!” 

“Who wants it?” Pickrell asked 
violently. Then, reflectively, “We 
did what we had to do, to do what 
had to be done. The other way was 
too risky. We couldn’t leave it to 
time and chance.” 

“Where’s McMillen?” 

“Alive. In New York probably. 
He’s had plastic surgery, and he’s 
under twenty-four hour guard. Not 
because we don’t trust him ; we just 
can’t take chances. He gets what- 
ever he wants, within reason.” 
“Except the privilege of coming 
out,” Amos said. “He can’t come 
out. Ever. He’ll die there, the fake 
hero.” 

“Yes.” Pickrell’s eyes snapped 
back to Amos. His face smoothed. 
“And you, poor dreamer,” he said 
sardonically, “you see now why I 
can’t keep you here. Only fabulous 

HOAX 



luck kept you from killing yourself. 
You might have cost the Air Force 
a fantastic sum in futile search and 
lost time.” 

“But I didn’t.” 

“Give you time,” Pickrell said 
confidently, “ — you would. I told 
you to get packed.” He glanced at 
his wristwatch. “The ferry is due in 
thirteen minutes.” 

Amos turned his head curiously. 
“Why are you so determined to get 
rid of me, Colonel?” 

“Out here dreamers die young,” 
Pickrell said flatly. “We should 
weed them out early — before we 
spend millions training them — ^but 
they won’t listen to me at the Acad- 
emy. To stay alive out here you 
have to be ruthless. We got out here 
by a hoax, but we can’t live on il- 
lusions. I don’t want to die because 
some fool bums a hole in the 
Doughnut while he’s gazing at the 
stars. Out here is reality. You can’t 
dream your way around it.” 

The Colonel’s face was no colder 
than Amos’s. 

“We’re out here on sufferance,” 
Pickrell continued. “We have to 
bring our environment with us 
wherever we go, and it isn’t enough. 
The air stinks. The food is awful. 
The water tastes of human waste 
material. There’s no privacy. Try 
as we can, we never really become 
completely adjusted to no-weight. 
We live with death at our elbow: 
too much heat, too much cold, too 
much acceleration, too much ultra- 
violet, too little air, too thin a bar- 
rier against the night and the in- 
visible bullets that speed through 
space, too many unfiltered rays and 
particles. •

‘*IVe got five blind spots from 
heavy primaries plowing through 
the center of my retina. If an acci- 
dent doesn’t take me first, I’ll die 
before I’m sixty.” 

“Or if someone doesn’t kill you,” 
Amos murmured. 

A tight grin slipped across the 
Colonel’s face. “Could a dreamer 
take that?” he asked. “He’d crack 
up — if he lived that long. We need 
men out here, not boys. That’s why 
you’re going back.” 

He stood up as straight as the 
overhead would allow and started 
for the doorway as if everything had 
been said. 

“Colonel,” Amos said, lifting his 
voice a little. “How do you get a 
man to go through five years of hell 
at the Academy and then come out 
here to live with discomfort and 
death — ^if you take away the 
dream?” 

Pickrell swung back, frowning. 

“I thought I’d tell you. Colonel: 
I’m not going back.” 

“What did you say?” Pickrell 
asked slowly. 

“Send me back,” Amos said 
clearly, “and I’ll expose the hoax.” 

Pickrell grinned. “Blackmail?” 

“Call it that.” 

Pickrell studied Amos as if the 
cadet had suddenly changed faces. 
“I’ve got a hunch I’ve been wrong 
about you. I’ve decided to let you 
stay.” 

Amos accepted it as if he had 
expected nothing else. 

“I’ll tell you the real reason,” 
Pickrell went on. “Not because of 
what you might say — who’d be- 
lieve a courtmartialed officer, dis- 
gruntled, out for revenge? Or may- 



be a little accident — they’re easy to 
come by out here and they’re usual- 
ly fatal. No — ^you did make that 
trip; there must be something of a 
pilot in you. And I see now that you 
can be ruthless, too.” 

Pickrell chuckled. “Blackmail! 
Danton, I think I like you after all. 
Now that you’ve got diis foolishness 
about heroes and the great adven- 
ture knocked out of you, maybe 
you’ll be a spaceman yet. You’re 
right — it’s the best solution. We 
can’t let you go back. Not ever. 
You’ll be McMillen’s counterpart, 
out here. Next shift you take over a 
taxi. Good night. Lieutenant, Sweet 
dreams.” 

He stooped through the door- 
way: a hard, unhappy man — a 
dreamer who had sold his dreams 
for the means to make them real. 
When his dreams came back to 
haunt him, they must be bitter. 

Amos grimaced as a tiny spot of 
pain burned briefly in his chest. A 
heavy primary had passed through 
a pain receptor. 

He touched the button beside the 
viewport, and the outside cover 
lifted away. Out there was Mare. 
Somewhere was Venus and the 
rest. Nearer, almost within reach, 
was the moon. 

They weren’t the same, he and 
the Colonel, Amos thought. 

The dreams a man absorbs from 
his society, as naturally as the air 
he breathes, aren’t important. Soon 
or late — they die. Call it: growing 
up. 

And when a man grows up he has 
to make his own dreams. His were 
still out there. • • •

The Levels System was a very democratic process, but the 



rules were strict — and the worst 
knowing who the Inspectors

part was not 



were 



N6 



1 CERTAINLY never thought 
that when Joe Bedlow went crazy 
two years ago and ran up into the 
Sierra Nevada Mountains with that 
waitress from C3, that it would 
have anything to do with whether 
or not Elaine and I would make our 
promotion from N5 to N6. I know 
absolutely that I wasn’t thinking 
about Joe Bedlow that Friday night 
when Elaine and I were waiting for 
Tom and Edith Weathers to come 
over from Small Orchard, which, 
as anyone at all knows is an N4, not 
an N5 like Hill Grove, our little 
section here in Northern California. 



It was an evening in spring, and 
I was sitting in the living room 
reading the History. I knew, of 
course, that there wasn’t much time 
left to try to learn history. Our five 
years would be up the next night at 
midnight; and if we didn’t make it, 
we would be stuck with N5 for at 
least another period. Yet I kept 
thinking that sometime between 
now and then perhaps an Inspector 
might ask me a question about the 
History, and I wanted to be ready 
if I could. You never knew who an 
Inspector was. 

I was particularly trying to con-

I was interrupted by the sound 
of Elaine calling me from the bath- 
room. I took off my glasses and 
slammed the book shut. I was not 
angry at being interrupted — I was 
always happy for an excuse to quit 
reading the History, because it was 
so much more difficult than reading 
the self-improvement books which 
we received in N5 and twice as diffi- 
cult as reading the historical ro- 
mances which we had during the 
years we spent in N4. It was just 
the fact that I kept thinking about 
how it would be if Elaine and I did 
not go on to N6, and I felt like 
slamming a good many things in 
addition to the book. 

“John,” Elaine said, “did you 
hear me?” 

“No.” 

“I asked you if you had tied your 
tie yet?” 

“I have not,” I said. 

“It’s almost eight o’clock.” 

“It’s almost doomsday.” 

Elaine appeared at the bedroom 
door and looked at me. Elaine is 
thirty-five, two years yoimger than 
I, but she still looks like the same 
sweet girl I married back in twenty- 
nineteen. She looked particularly 
nice that night, because she was 
wearing the pale blue taffeta that 
I’d always liked so well. 

“John,” she said, “you said we 



weren’t going to talk about it to- 
night. You said we wouldn’t even 
think about it.” 

I put my feet up on the hassock 
and looked at my toes. “I’m sorry. 
And I promise I won’t think about 
it anymore.” 

“Just put on your tie and your 
jacket. Tom and Edith will be here 
any minute.” 

“I wish they weren’t coming.” 

“John, please.” 

“I just wish they weren’t com- 
ing.” 

“You can show Tom the Wane- 
cruiser-Eight.” 

“I’m sick of showing Tom the 
Wanecruiser-Eight.” 

“John, you promised you’d stop 
thinking about everything.” 

“Well, I’m sick of showing Tom 
the Wanecruiser-Eight, that’s all. 
Aren’t you sick of showing Edith 
the Mist Coffee Um?” 

“No, I’m not, because we worked 
hard to get into N5. All Edith has 
is a simple Hi-Class Percolator, and 
I like to show the Mist Coffee Um 
to Edith.” 

“Do you like to have Cathy Stan- 
well show you her Gold Spiral 
Server?” 

Elaine blinked, and I thought she 
was going to cry. I stood up quickly 
and patted her on the shoulder. 
“Don’t mind me. I’m sorry. I’m 
sure we’ll make it. I really am.” 

Elaine kept blinking, then finally 
she wrinkled her nose at me and 
went back to the bathroom. Elaine 
and I have always believed in spirit 
and positivism. We’d taken the hard 
knocks together before, and we 
could, I told myself, take them 
again.

However, as I tied my tie in the 
bedroom, my mind kept wandering 
back to the fact that our deadline 
had just about arrived, and I 
couldn’t help becoming irritated 
all over again that someone in Ar- 
rangements had somehow scheduled 
our weekly visit with Brad and 
Cathy Stanwell in their section of 
N6 to be the very next night after 
Tom and Edith Weathers visited 
us from their section in N4. 

As a matter of fact, I even got 
to doubting the worth of the entire 
System, even though I’d voted the 
straight Levels ticket ever since I 
was twenty-one. 

I tried to get my thoughts back 
to normal by thinking about the 
History again and remembering 
how things were when each Level 
kept to itself and there was no visit- 
ing between Levels at all. I knew 
that that hadn’t worked, because 
one couldn’t very well appreciate 
what one had if there wasn’t some- 
one around to show it to who didn’t 
have it. 

I remembered, of course, that 
the people in Z99 (Reinvested In- 
terest Profits) got to enjoy visits 
from the Level below them but 
didn’t have to visit anyone in the 
Level above because there wasn’t 
one higher. But I recalled what 
Harry Woodly always said about 
that: “It’s no skin off my nose, we 
can’t all be President.” 

It did help to remember that 
there were the Als (Intellectual) 
who had to visit the next Level up 
but were unable to have anyone at 
all visit them from a Level below 
because they were on the very bot- 
tom. I had never gotten too straight 

N4 N5 N6 



about why the Als, who had the 
highest IQ rating, were on the low- 
est Level, when in every other in- 
stance the IQ rating rose in cor- 
respondence to the Level. The His- 
tory explained something about the 
Als not caring about an)^ing really 
worthwhile materially, and so they 
didn’t care if there was anybody 
around to show it off to or not. But 
I’d never been completely clear on 
it. 

At any rate, thinking about the 
Als and their being on the bottom 
of the heap didn’t help my own at- 
titude very much, and I kept wish- 
ing thkt whoever in Arrangements 
had scheduled our visits program 
hadn’t done it the way he had. Re- 
gardless of what I’d told Elaine, it 
was a lot of fun to show Tom the 
Wanecruiser-Eight; but not nearly 
so much as it might have been if the 
very next night I hadn’t had to 
stand around while Brad Stanwell 
showed me his Hydro-Ten. 

Finally, my thoughts were broken 
when the front door chimes sound- 
ed, and I put on the jacket of my 
dress suit and walked out to let 
Edith and Tom in. 

“Hi, folks!” I tried to make my 
greeting bright, but it was an ef- 
fort. 

“Hi, John!” Edith said. 

“Well, hi, John!” Tom said. 

We shook hands all around and 
beamed at one another, and then 
I said, “sit down, folks. Elaine’ll be 
right out.” 

They crossed the living room to 
the sofa, and I noticed that Edith 
was wearing that black satin dress 
again. It was not nearly as nice as 
Elaine’s pale blue taffeta; as a mat- 

31 




ter of fact, it was rather cheap- 
looking. Yet somehow I had never 
disliked it. Edith had an awfully 
good figure which was accented in 
that black dress It may have been 
an illusion, but there seemed to be 
a good deal more movement in that 
black dress than there was when 
she wore something else. 

“Well, folks,” I said, getting my 
mind back to the affairs at hand, 
“how about a Martini?” 

We always served Martinis, just 
as Tom and Edith always served 
blended whiskey and the Stanwells 
always served bonded Scotch; but 
it was always nice to ask anyway. 

“Why, sure, John!” Tom said. 

“Fll have a wee sip, kiddo,” 
Edith said. It was that kind of talk 
that always ruined the other attrib- 
utes that Edith had. 

I mixed the Martinis and poured 
them, and by that time Elaine came 
out and said hello to Tom and 
Edith. We all sat down and sipped 
at our drinks, then I said, “How’s 
the Hublo-Six, Tom?” 

I knew pretty well how the Hub- 
lo-Six was because I’d flown one 
all the time we were in N4, but it 
seemed like the thing to say. I kept 
remembering Brad Stanwell’s Hy- 
dro-Ten and what it would be like 
if we didn’t make it into N6 and 
never got to own our own Hydro- 
Ten; and it seemed more impor- 
tant than ever that I remembered 
that Tom owned only a Hublo-Six. 

“Well,” Tom said, “she’s really a 
beauty when you come to think of 
it. I didn’t think so at first, but now 
I think she’s a pretty swell little 
copter.” 

I was rather siuprised by Tom’s 
32 



answer; as a matter of fact, I’d 
never heard him answer like that 
about the Hublo-Six in all the years 
that we’d been entertaining them. 

“I guess,” I said, “that’s because 
you’ve never flown a Wanecruiser- 
Eight, Tom. Wait until you do that, 
then you’ll know what a copter is 
really like.” 

“Well,” Tom said, smilingly 
brightly at me, “everyone to his 
own taste.” 

I know that I didn’t smile back 
at him. I’d never heard Tom talk 
like that, and I wasn’t certain that 
he was feeling well. I should have 
let it go, but I was getting a little 
angry. “Would you like to take a 
look at her, Tom?” 

“The Hublo-Six, John?” 

“No,” I said, trying to keep my 
voice calm, “the Wanecruiser-Eight, 
Tom.” 

“Oh, why, sure. Let’s do it now!” 
Right away, I felt a little better. 
“You girls take your time with those 
drinks,” I said. “Then we’ll be on 
our way.” 

Just as Tom and I were leaving 
the room, I heard Edith say to 
Elaine, “Honey, I’ve drunk up al- 
ready. Do you think just one more 
wee sip would hurt anything?” 

I was getting rather confused. We 
never served more than one Martini 
before we left for the club. 

“That Edith,” Tom said, “she’s a 
regular card tonight. I don’t know 
what’s got into her.” 

I didn’t know what had gotten 
into either one of them. I won- 
dered, in fact, whether everyone 
was going crazy. However, in the 
garage, I tried to get back into the 
spirit of things. I slapped the left 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




wing of the Wanecruiser-Eight and 
said, “There she is, Tom. Sweetest 
little copter you’d ever want to 
own.” 

Tom walked around it slowly, 
looking at everything. We’d been 
doing this for quite a while now, 
and I thought I knew pretty well 
what he was going to say. I was 
surprised, therefore, when he said, 
“Well, for speed maybe she’s all 
right, John. But I’ll take that little 
Hublo-Six for just plain maneuver- 
ability.” 

“Well,” I said. And then because 
I couldn’t think of anything else at 
all to say, I said, “Well, well.” 

“She’s a real looker, John,” Tom 
said, slapping the front end, “but 
she’s a little heavy, you know?” 

I got out a cigarette and lit it, 
thinking that the main thing was 
that I should stay calm regardless of 
what had happened to Tom. Elaine 
and I still had a chance to get into 
N6, even though it looked pretty 
slim by now; and I didn’t want to 
lose even that by letting anything 
at all bother me and tip me off 
balance. 



A fter WE’D flown to the dub, 
i-we sat down at the usual table 
and said hello to the usual people 
who stopped by. Then Tom and 
Edith went out on the floor to 
dance. They always wanted to 
dance the first thing. Of course, 
the club’s music was good and the 
dance floor was nice; I couldn’t 
really blame them because I knew 
that all they had was the hall in 
N4. Yet I knew, too, that they 
would have to learn more restraint 



if they were ever going to get into 
N5, and jumping up to dance the 
first thing was not showing a whole 
lot of restraint. 

“What in God’s name is wrong 
with them tonight?” I asked Elaine. 

“I don’t know, John. Maybe 
nothing is wrong with them. Maybe 
it’s just us. I wish you woulan’t 
look so worried. If there’s an In- 
spector around here tonight — ” 

“Please just don’t talk about In- 
spectors,” I said. “I just want to 
know what’s wrong with Tom and 
Edith.” 

Elaine stared out at the dance 
floor as they danced by. “I know 
one thing that’s wrong with Edith. 
That dress. It’s perfectly ugly.” 

I watched Edith do a tricky little 
step which did not involve too 
much footwork, but which seemed 
to involve about everything else. 
“That black dress?” I said. 

“Yes,” Elaine said. “It’s per- 
fectly ugly.” 

I knew that we were both tense 
about everything, and I knew that 
the black dress was not in good 
taste like Elaine’s pale blue taffeta. 
But it irritated me that Elaine was 
throwing in something else to worry 
about when there was enough al- 
ready. Elaine, I thought, had a 
marvelous capacity for worrying 
about inconsequential things when 
there were the big things to worry 
about. Finally I said, “I don’t see 
much wrong with that black dress.” 

Elaine looked at me in a way that 
I hadn’t seen since that time I ac- 
cidentally put the Wanecruiser- 
Eight down on her bed of gladioli, 
but Edith and Tom came back to 
the table before she had time to 



N4 N5 N6 



33 




say anything. 

“Isn’t this grand music?” Tom 
said. “Why don’t you folks get out 
there and shake a leg?” 

Elaine was silent, and I looked 
at my glass. We were having 
bonded whiskey, but I had barely 
touched mine; in the club it was 
always much better just to sip at 
your drink and make it last. 

Then I noticed that Edith was 
tipping up her glass and draining 
her drink. I was surprised, but not 
so surprised that I failed to notice 
how becoming her neck looked 
when her head was tipped back that 
way. 

I glanced at Elaine and saw that 
she was looking away angrily, then 
Edith put down her glass and said, 
“I’ve got a beautiful idea, every- 
one.” 

Tom grinned at her. “What’s 
that, Edith?” 

“Let’s all get swizzled tonight!” 

In approximately twenty-six 
hours we’d either be in N6 or we 
wouldn’t, and frankly I was be- 
ginning to think absolutely that we 
weren’t going to make it. I sup- 
pose that I was becoming really 
frightened, and perhaps that was 
why I got into the same mood that 
Edith was in. 

In the time that we usually took 
to drink two drinks, Edith and I 
had drunk four. Tom didn’t seem 
to notice, but Elaine was becoming 
angrier by the minute. 

Even the waiter seemed a little 
surprised, I noticed. I wondered 
why he should be, because I hap- 
pened to have known that he was 
an E3, and I’d heard that E3s got 

34 



drunk once and twice a week on 
just beer. 

But I didn’t care much what any- 
body thought; matching drinks 
with Edith seemed to be about the 
only way to combat all that tension 
I was feeling. 

“Let’s have another one,” I said. 
Elaine glared at me. Then Tom 
said, “Let’s dance, shall we, 
Elaine?” 

Elaine was certainly angry at me, 
I knew, but I stood up and smiled 
very brightly at her as she and Tom 
left the table. Then Edith and I 
were alone. We touched glasses, and 
I said, “Here’s to it, Edith.” 
“Here’s to what, John?” 

“Here’s to anything, Edith.” 
“Let’s dance, shall we, John?” 

Of course, I’d noticed before how 
it was to dance with Edith, but I’d 
always been pretty careful about it, 
holding her away and such. But 
tonight I wasn’t very careful at all, 
and I didn’t care that I wasn’t. 

We went around the floor slowly, 
and I caught sight of Elaine watch- 
ing us over Tom’s shoulder; but I 
looked the other way. Near the 
bandstand I saw that Fred Wicket 
was also watching us in a very pe- 
culiar manner. For a moment I did 
move Edith away — I’d always had 
the suspicion that Fred Wicket was 
an Inspector. But then Edith said, 
“What’s the matter, John?” 

“Nothing,” I S2iid, letting her 
move back where she had been. 
“Not one little solitary thing, 
Edith.” 

I was even beginning to feel that 
if I could do something to ruin 
everything, it would be better than 
all this waiting. 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




“John,” Edith said. “The mu- 
sic’s stopped.” 

“Oh, has it?” 

“John, I feel a little wobbly- 
headed. Let’s go outside. Do you 
want to?” 

“Yes,” I said. “Let’s go out- 
side.” 

There was a yellow moon shin- 
ing over the golf course which 
bordered the north side of the club- 
house, and Edith and I walked 
across the soft grass of the eighth 
hole. “I feel so funny tonight, 
John,” she said. 

“Funny?” 

“Yes. I just feel kind of crazy, 
like I don’t give a damn.” 

“I feel pretty much the same way, 
Edith.” 

“I feel like I just wouldn’t care 
what in the world happened to- 
night, John.” 

We reached the area where the 
copters were parked and walked be- 
tween the rows of Wanecruiser- 
Eights. “That’s just about the way 
I feel, Edith.” 

We stopped beside one of the 
copters, and Edith leaned back 
against the door of the cabin. 

“What’s the matter with us to- 
night, John?” 

^“I don’t know,” I said. “I 
thought that you and Tom both 
were acting funny earlier, and now 
I’m acting the same way.” 

“Let’s not think about Tom, shall 
we. John?” 

“All right,” I said. 

Edith reached up and patted my 
cheek, and I took her hand. 

“Let’s not think about Elaine 
either, shall we?” I asked. 

“All right. What shall we think 

N4 N5 N6 



about then?” 

“I don’t know. Can you think of 
something?” 

“Yes ” 

“What?” 

“Can’t you guess?” 

It was kind of confused after that. 
1 found myself kissing Edith, and 
we kind of bumped around between 
the cabin door and the left wing, 
and I almost fell down. Then, sud- 
denly, I remembered about Joe 
Bedlow and how they had demoted 
him down to M2 because of all 
that trouble he’d gotten into with 
that waitress, and I regained my 
senses. “Edith,” I said, “we 
shouldn’t be doing this.” 

“Don’t you like it, John?” she 
asked. 

“I don’t think that’s quite the 
entire point,” I said. “I just don’t 
think we ought to be doing this.” 
“Oh. John,” she said sadly, “and 
I just don’t give a damn at all what 
happens.” 

“Edith, let’s get back inside.” 
“All right, John.” 

We walked back between the 
copters, and I wiped at my mouth 
with my handkerchief while Edith 
tried to smooth her hair. We’d 
gotten to the rim of the golf course, 
when I saw Fred Wicket. He was 
standing just outside the broad 
French windows of the clubhouse, 
staring at us. I suddenly felt very 
ill. 

“What’s the matter, John?” 
Edith asked. “You look pale.” 

“I still feel a little funny, I 
guess.” 

“Do you want to go back to the 
parking lot, John?” 

“I don’t mean that kind of 

35 




funny,” I said. “I mean I feel a lit- 
tle weak.” 

“Poor John.” She reached up 
and patted my cheek. 

“Edith, don’t do that.” I knew 
that everything was ruined now 
and that it wouldn’t make much 
difference if Edith patted my cheek 
or not. But I just wanted to forget 
what had happened. I just wanted 
to get out of there. 

Inside, Elaine looked at me, and 
it seemed to me that her eyes had 
actually turned to ice. “You’re 
back,” she said. 

“Yes, ma’am,” I said. “And I 
don’t feel very well either. I think 
maybe I’d like to go home.” 

It was all very uncomfortable 
and embarrassing, but we got up 
and got our coats; then we flew 
home in the Wanecruiser-Eight. 

When Tom and Edith had left in 
their Hublo-Six, Elaine said, “Well, 
you couldn’t have picked a better 
time to do what you did tonight, 
could you?” 

Before I could say anything, 
Elaine had gone into the bedroom 
and slammed the door. 

I spent the night on the couch 
in the study, but I didn’t sleep very 
much. Elaine had certainly been 
right; I’d picked a beautiful night 
for losing my balance. Whether or 
not I’d really done anything serious 
didn’t make any difference. The 
fact was that I’d shown a great deal 
of instability, and if there was any- 
thing that you shouldn’t show in 
Hill Grove, I thought, it was in- 
stability. I kept remembering how 
Fred Wicket had looked at us as 
we’d crossed back from the parking 
lot, and I knew that Elaine and I 

36 



were going to be in Hill Grove for a 
good long while. 

T he fact that we had to go 
to Tall Oaks and be entertained 
by Brad and Cathy Stanwell the 
next evening did not help matters 
at all. Elaine had not spoken to me 
all through that next day, and it 
was a great effort on my part even 
to smile when we faced Brad and 
Cathy that night. 

Brad is a large ruddy-faced fel- 
low, and Cathy is pretty and trim — 
although not at all like Edith 
Weathers. I’d always felt that we 
were rather lucky to have them for 
our N6 couple, and I’d always 
thought that when we moved on 
to N6 ourselves, we’d go right on 
seeing them of our own desire. Now, 
all of that was changed, I knew. 
I knew that we weren’t going to go 
into N6, and nothing at all seemed 
important. 

However, Brad and Cathy 
seemed particularly gay, and so I 
tried my very best to look enthusi- 
astic. 

“Sit down, children,” Brad said, 
“and let old pappy pour you a 
Scotch and soda!” 

“Right,” I said. 

“Just wonderful,” Elaine said. 
“Have some hors d’oeuvres,” 
Cathy said. 

We sipped our drinks and tasted 
the hors d’ouevres, and I kept 
glancing at my watch. It was eight- 
thirty, three and a half hours away 
from our deadline. I wondered why 
I’d done what I’d done the night 
before, but I knew the reasons 
didn’t matter; I’d done it, all right. 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR, 




I tried to smile and nod as Cathy 
and Brad chatted on happily. 

Then finally Brad said, “Cathy, 
let’s not hold out on them any 
longer, shall we?” 

Cathy smiled very prettily. “All 
right. You tell them, Brad.” 

They both looked at us, their eyes 
dancing, and Brad said, “John, how 
would you like to go out and take 
a look at the Hydro-Ten?” 

Going out and taking a look at 
Brad’s Hydro-Ten was just about 
the last thing in the world that I 
wanted to do right then, but I 
nodded and said, “Why, sure. Brad. 
I’d love to!” 

Brad kept grinning at me. “Espe- 
cially if you knew you were going to 
start flying one yourself, eh, John?” 
I stared at him and put my drink 
down and rubbed my palms over 
my knees. “How’s that, Brad?” 
“Children, you’ve done it!” Brad 
said laughing. “You are now in 
N6!” 

I blinked at him, then I looked at 
Elaine. There were tears in her 
eyes, but she was smiling just as 
though she might never stop. 
“You’re kidding,” I said. 

“No, sir, John. I am not. They 
told us to give you the message. 
It’s authenticated. You’re in!” 

I opened my mouth and closed 
it. “Well, by golly!” I said. 

The next minute, Elaine was 
kissing me and I was kissing her. 
Brad pumped my hand, and Elaine 
and Cathy hugged each other, 
laughing and crying. I’d never been 
so happy in my life. 

“Well,” Brad said finally, “don’t 
you want to look at that Hydro- 
Ten now, John?” 

N4 N5 N6 



“Brad,” I said pretty loudly, “you 
bet your life I do!” 

I walked to the door with Brad, 
then I stopped and looked back at 
Elaine and waved at her. She blew 
me a kiss. It was wonderful. 

In the garage I kept walking 
around the Hydro-Ten, and Brad 
just stood there and watched me, 
grinning widely. “Great feeling, 
isn’t it?” 

I nodded and finally leaned back 
against the copter. “It really is. 
Brad. Only a few minutes ago, I 
thought — ” 

. “That you weren’t going to make 
it?” 

“Yes.” 

“I felt the same way, John. Just 
exactly. I was worried about it for 
weeks. And then, near the end, I 
thought absolutely that we wouldn’t 
do it.” 

“I surely didn’t think we would. 
Brad. I really didn’t.” 

“I’ll tell you this, John. You 
ought to feel proud. Not everybody 
makes it, you know. And the reason 
they don’t is because they don’t 
have the balance. John, to progress 
this way, you’ve got to have bal- 
ance — that’s the whole thing. Some 
try too hard. Others don’t try hard 
enough. The ones who make it show 
they’ve got the balance. And you 
made it, John.” 

“Yes. But I still don’t understand 
it.” 

Brad nodded understandingly. 
“I’ll tell you, I didn’t either. Not 
for a little while anyway. But here 
in N6 you learn more, John. You 
get some perspective. You get the 
viewpoints of the boys here in Tall 
Oaks. And now that I think back 



37 




on when Cathy and I were in N5, 
I realize that it was balance, just 
good old natural balance, that got 
us through.” 

“Balance,” I said. 

“Right.” Brad got out two cigars 
and we lit up. “Listen, John, I’ll 
tell you a little story — something I 
don’t want to get out, you under- 
stand. Just a little story, man to 
man.” 

“All right,” I said, puffing on the 
cigar. 

“This happened one day before 
our deadline was up in N5. We’d 
just about given up, and then we 
went to that club dance they have 
back in Hill Grove, you know?” 

“I know,” I said. 

“I’ll tell you, I don’t know what 
got into me that night. I was 
scared, I guess. Both Cathy and I 
were scared, and we were fighting 
each other. And — ^well, we were en- 
tertaining this couple from N4, and 
I was drinking a little too much, 
and bango! First thing I knew I was 
outside with the wife of this N4 
fellow, and — ” Brad motioned a 
hand. “It wasn’t anything serious, 
you understand, John. It wasn’t 
anything at all, really, and I didn’t 
feel any different about Cathy or 
anything like that. It just hap- 
pened.” 

“I’ll be damned,” I said. 

“Somebody saw us, I was certain 
of that. And right there I gave up. 
I really did. Only the next night 
we were told, just like you were to- 
night, that we’d made it into N6.” 

“Well, well, well,” I said. 

“Now, the point of this, John, is 
that I think maybe that’s what did 
it. I couldn’t say for certain, but I 

38 



think maybe that’s really what did 
it.” Brad looked at his cigar re- 
flectively. “You see I’d been trying 
too hard up to then, not being very 
human and natural, you know? 
And you’ve got to be human and 
natural to get along here in N6. 
All the boys, all the girls, we’re all 
human and natural here — ^how 
would it be if we had someone in 
here who wasn’t?” 

“Not so hot,” I said. 

“Right. Only you never need to 
worry about that, John. Those boys 
and girls won’t get in. I’ll tell you 
that. Not if they don’t prove they’re 
human and natural. You see, I’ve 
always figured it was that next to 
the last night that really made the 
difference. What happened wasn’t 
too much, nor too little, and maybe 
that proved the balance. I haven’t 
talked to any of the other boys here 
in the section about it — I mentioned 
it to you, John, because we’ve been 
such good friends and because I’m 
proud to have you here in Tall 
Oaks. But I really think that’s what 
did it.” 

I nodded, puffing on the cigar 
and watching the smoke drift to- 
ward the ceiling. “By the way, 
Brad,” I said finally, “what did she 
look like?” 

“Who, John?” 

“That girl.” 

“Oh. Well, she was a looker. I’ll 
tell you that. Not like Elaine or 
Cathy — I mean not their type. She 
was rather common, as a matter of 
fact. But she had a hell of a figure. 
And I’ll never forget how she 
looked in that dress.” 

“That dress?” 

“That black satin dress.” Brad 
JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




shook his head. “You know, this 
might sound silly, John, but some- 
how IVe always had a theory about 
her.” 

“A theory?” 

Brad nodded. “I’ve always had 
the theory that Edith was an In- 
spector.” 

“Well,” I said. “Well, well.” 

Brad’s eyes were preoccupied, 
then he straightened suddenly. 
“Listen, the girls are calling. Let’s 
go back and really celebrate this, 
Siall we?” 

“Right!’* I slapped the tail of 
the Hydro-Ten, and then Brad and 
I walked back to the living room. 

“Look,” Cathy said, “I’ve made 



new drinks, and now we’re going 
to have a toast.” 

We stood in a circle in the cen- 
ter of the room with the drinks in 
our hands, and Brad said, “All 
right. A toast to what?” 

“A toast to N7!” Cathy said. 

I hadn’t thought about that until 
that very moment; and I paused a 
second, letting it really come to me. 
Then, suddenly, I raised my glass 
and looked at Elaine. “To N7!” I 
said. 

Elaine smiled back at me bril- 
liantly, and then all four of us said 
together, “To N7!” 

It was a very wonderful moment.

WORTH CITING 

SCIENTIFIC BRAINS and money from Government, the 
public and industry are being pooled in a new “crash” program 
to find a drug or drugs to cure cancer. This voluntary, cooper- 
ative effort will be like that of wartime researches which gave us 
radar and the atom bomb. For the first time, public, private 
and industrial research in the field of cancer chemotherapy will 
be brought under the guidance of one organization: The Cancer 
Chemotherapy National Committee — C.C.N.C. Synthetic chem- 
icals and those from plants, hormones and viruses will be investi- 
gated as potential remedies. The program will make it possible 
for scientists working on a particular aspect of the problem to 
exchange ideas and suggest new lines of approach. It will obtain 
particular chemicals for study and will keep an “intelligence 
file” for references to progress with compounds. 

Our citation this month goes to the government and private 
agencies and industries who are spending some twelve to fifteen 
million dollars on the search for chemicals to stop cancer; and to 
the C.C.N.C. which will give the direction needed to make this 
investment more profitable in terms of lives saved from cancer.

the earthman 



BY IRVING COX, JR. 



The jour survivors were sitting ducks 
surrounded by barbaric savages. And 
they were doubly handicapped, because 
they knew that one of them was a traitor! 



T he robot supply ship came 
every Thursday at seven min- 
utes after noon. It was an unfor- 
tunate hour for the personnel of the 
Nevada station, who happened to 
be in the commissary at lunch. Out 
of fourteen hundred assigned to the 
post, only four escaped — ^two guards 
on noon duty in the watch tower; 
the Commander’s wife, who had 
skipped lunch and stayed in her 
cottage; and Captain Tchassen. 

The Captain was on a hill south 
of the station making a Tri-D shot 



of the range of mountains west of 
the camp. He took his amateur 
photography seriously and, like any 
tourist, he was fascinated by the 
rugged scenery; there was nothing 
comparable to this on any world in 
the civilized galaxy. To get the back 
lighting that he wanted, Tchassen 
would cheerfully have given up any 
number of meals. As a matter of 
fact, he wasn’t aware that it was 
noon until he heard the jet blast of 
the supply ship as it came in on the 
transit beam. 





Tchassen saw the ship spin out of 
control as the beam went haywire. 
The robot plunged into the heart 
of the station and the earth shook in 
the catastrophic explosion of the 
nuclear reactor. The commissary, 
the communication center, the sup- 
ply sheds and the row of patrol 
ships vanished in the rising, mush- 
room cloud. Concussion threw 
Tchassen violently to the ground. 
His camera was smashed against a 
boulder. 

The Captain picked himself up 
unsteadily. He took a capsule from 
his belt pouch and swallowed it — a 
specific against shock and radiation 
sickness. In a remarkably short time, 
Tchassen’s mind cleared. He saw 
the prisoners pouring through the 
gap torn in the compound fence 
and running for the hills. But that 
did not alarm him particularly. 
They were unarmed and for the 
moment they represented no real 
danger. 

Tchassen began to run toward 
the ruined administrative center. 
He had to find out if there were any 
other survivors and he had to make 
emergency contact with the occupa- 
tion base on the coast. He ran with 
considerable difficulty. After less 
than a hundred yards, he was gasp- 
ing for breath. He slowed to a walk. 
He could feel the hammering of his 
heart; his throat was dry and ice 
cold. 

To the escaped prisoners, watch- 
ing from beyond the camp, the 
Captain’s weakness was unbeliev- 
able — ^for Tchassen, in his twenties, 
had a magnificent build. Typical of

the occupation army, he wore the 
regulation military uniform, knee- 
high boots and tight-fitting, silver 
colored trousers. Above the waist he 
was naked, except for the neck- 
chain which carried the emblem of 
his rank. His body was deeply 
tanned. His hair was a bristling, 
yellow crown. Yet, despite his ap- 
pearance, his sudden exhaustion 
was very real; Captain Tchassen 
had been on Earth only five days 
and he was still not adjusted to the 
atmospheric differences. 

As he passed the row of officers’ 
cottages, he fell against a wall, pant- 
ing for breath. The flat-roofed 
buildings were nearly a mile from 
the crater of the explosion, yet 
even here windows had been broken 
by concussion. A cold, arid wind 
whipped past the dwellings; some- 
where a door, torn loose from its 
frame, was banging back and forth. 

Then Tchassen heard a muffled 
cry. In one of the officer’s cottages 
he found Tynia. She had been 
thrown from her bed and the bed 
was overturned above her. It was a 
fortunate accident; the mattress 
had protected her from the flying 
glass. 

Tchassen helped her to her feet. 
She clung to him, trembling. He 
was very conscious of her sensuous 
beauty, as he had been since he first 
came to the Nevada station. Tynia 
was the wife of the commanding 
officer: Tchassen kept reminding 
himself of that, as if it could some- 
how build a barrier against her at- 
tractiveness. She was strikingly 
beautiful — and thirty years younger 
than her husband. It was common 
gossip that she had been flirting 

42 



with most of the junior officers as- 
signed to the station. Tchassen was, 
in fact, a security investigator sent 
to probe the potential scandal and 
recommend a means for heading it 
off. 

He gave Tynia a shock pill from 
his pouch. Her hysteria subsided. 
She became suddenly modest about 
the semi-transparent bedgown she 
was wearing, and she zipped into a 
tight coverall, made from the same 
silver-hued material as the Cap- 
tain’s trousers. They went outside. 
She stood a foot shorter than 
Tchassen. Her dark hair framed her 
face in graceful waves; make-up 
emphasized the size of her eyes and 
the lush, scarlet bow of her lips. 

Tynia glanced toward the crater, 
shielding her face from the noon 
sun. “What happened. Captain?” 
“The flight beam failed; the sup- 
ply ship exploded.” 

“And killed them all.” She said 
it flatly, without feeling — ^but 
Tchassen doubted that she would 
have mourned the loss of her hus- 
band in any case. 

“I’ll have to get word through 
to the coast. We’ll need a rescue 
helio and — ” 

“I know how to use the emer- 
gency transmitter,” Tynia volun- 
teered. “There may be other sur- 
vivors, Captain Tchassen; they’ll 
need your help.” 

“I don’t want to leave you alone, 
Tynia.” It was the first time he 
spoke her given name, though the 
informality was commonplace 
among the junior officers on the 
post. “The prisoners are out of the 
compound. We may have trouble.” 
“Not yet, Captain; they’re still 

IRVING COX, JR. 




unarmed. I’ll be all right.” She 
nodded toward the crater. “We 
have to make sure there’s no one 
else alive down there.” 

He left her reluctantly. She went 
toward the emergency communica- 
tions room, buried in a metal-walled 
pillbox which had been intentional- 
ly located far from the center of the 
station. Tchassen walked across the 
scarred earth in the direction of the 
crater. None of the important build- 
ings had survived. Concussion had 
tom up the fence arovmd the prison 
compound, but the cell block, hall 
a mile from the explosion and built 
of concrete and steel, was still 
standing. The watch tower, beyond 
the prison building, stood askew on 
bent metal pillars, but it was other- 
wise undamaged. 

The Captain knew that at least 
two guards were on watch duty at 
all hours; they might still be alive. 
He crossed the crater and pulled 
himself up the battered stairs to the 
top of the tower. The door was 
jammed. Using a broken piece of 
railing as a lever, he pried it open. 
He found the two guards uncon- 
scious, slumped across their observa- 
tion console. 

He gave them shock capsules, but 
the men regained consciousness 
slowly. While he waited, Tchassen 
read their identity disks. The Cor- 
poral, Gorin Drein, was a three-year 
draftee, serving a six month tour of 
duty on Earth. He was a fair-haired, 
blue-eyed boy, probably no more 
than twenty years old. Sergeant 
Briggan was an army career man, in 
his fifties and only a few years away 
from retirement. Yet the only physi- 

THE EARTHAAAN 



cal indication of his age was the 
touch of gray in his bristling mane 
of dark hair. 

When their erratic breathing 
steadied and they opened their eyes, 
the Captain explained what had 
happened. Both men were still grog- 
gy; the shock pills inhibited their 
normal emotional reactions. Neither 
Briggan nor Drein had much to say 
until Tchassen helped them down 
from the tower and they stood look- 
ing at the hole blasted in the earth. 

“The supply rocket,” Sergeant 
Briggan said slowly, “couldn’t have 
done this; the beam landings are 
foolproof. The prisoners must have 
pulled it off, though I don’t see — ” 

“How?” Tchassen broke in. “The 
compound fence didn’t go down 
imtil after the blast; there was no 
way any of them could get out.” 

“Robot ships just don’t get off 
the beam,” Corporal Drein declared 
stubbornly. 

Briggan nodded toward the 
empty cell block. “It worked out 
nicely — ^for the prisoners. A single 
explosion wipes out most of us; but 
the prisoners are far enough away 
from the blast center to escape.” 

“Surely there isn’t any danger of 
revolution,” Tchassen asked, un- 
consciously mocking the optimism 
of the security bulletins. “Not any 
longer.” 

Briggan grinned. “You’ve only 
been here five days, sir; you don’t 
know how thoroughly our indoc- 
trination has failed. The Earth 
people hate us more than ever.” 

“Even so, how could one of the 
prisoners have brought the robot 
down?” 

“By tampering with the beam.” 

43 




“But that means they had a sub- 
versive — that means one of us must 
be—” 

“An Earthman, yes. We encour- 
age them to apply for citizenship. If 
we had an Earthman on the post 
masquerading as an officer, how 
would we know it — unless he told 
us? They’re no different from our 
own people, Captain.” 

On the other side of the crater 
Tynia staggered out of the com- 
munications pillbox. Tchassen saw 
her waving frantically and he knew 
something was wrong — very wrong. 
He began to run toward her. Brig- 
gan and Drein followed close be- 
hind him. Almost immediately the 
Captain staggered and gasped for 
breath; he motioned for the Ser- 
geant and the Corporal to go on 
without him. 

Briggan waited long enough to 
say, “So far we’ve located four sur- 
vivors, sir — only four. And one of 
the four is very probably an Earth- 
man. The transit beams don’t fail 
of their own accord. It’s not a very 
nice thing to think about, is it, sir?” 

The two men left him and Tchas- 
sen walked slowly, alone across the 
barren land. The wind whispered 
against his naked chest; it felt sud- 
denly cold and forbidding. The 
ragged peaks piled on the western 
horizon were no longer simply 
photogenic curiosities of an alien 
world, but symbols of undefined 
terror. 

Why had the supply robot 
crashed? Why had the prisoners 
been able to get away without a 
casualty? Had it been planned by 
an officer of the station? If so, 



where was he now — ^with the pris- 
oners, dead in the commissary, or 
among the four survivors? The tide 
of questions hammered at Tchas- 
sen’s mind, but he came up with 
no workable answers. His real trou- 
ble stemmed from the fact that he 
knew so little about the Earth peo- 
ple. Their reasoning was beyond ra- 
tional analysis. They were physically 
identical to normal human beings, 
and it was almost impossible not to 
assume that their thinking would be 
normally human, too. 

When Tchassen reached the com- 
munications pillbox, the Sergeant, 
the Corporal, and Tynia were in- 
side. In the gloomy half-light he 
saw the others silently trying to 
patch together the broken wires of 
the transmitter. It was hopeless; 
Tchassen saw that at once. Only a 
master technician could have made 
sense out of that jumbled maze. The 
other three knew that, too. They 
stopped when they saw Tchassen 
and looked at him expectantly, 
waiting for him to tell them what to 
do. With something of a shock, he 
realized that he now ranked as sta- 
tion commander. 

“I don’t believe the explosion 
wrecked the transmitter,” Tchassen 
decided uncertainly. 

“It was tom up like this when I 
first came in,” Tynia told him. 

“So we couldn’t get in touch with 
the occupation base. Obviously one 
of the prisoners did it. They must 
have had — The Captain licked his 
lips, “They must have had outside 
help.” 

“What do we do now?” Tynia’s 
voice was shrill with rising hysteria. 
“We can’t radio for a rescue ship. 

IRVING COX, JR. 



44 




How do we get away?” 

“It’s up to us to find something 
else.” 

She moved close to Sergeant 
Briggan, reaching for his hand. 
“The Earth people are outside 
somewhere, waiting to kill us. We 
can’t escape, Captain! And you 
start talking nonsense — ” 

Very deliberately Tchassen 
slapped the back of his hand against 
her cheek. The pillbox was abruptly 
very still. She stared at him, her eyes 
wide. Slowly she raised her hand 
and touched the reddening mark on 
her face. She shrank against Brig- 
gan and the Sergeant put his arm 
around her shoulders. 

“You didn’t have to do that, 
Captain,” he bristled. 

“Don’t quarrel,” Tynia whis- 
pered. “Not on my account.” 

Tchassen’s muscles tensed. This 
was the way Tynia had created ten- 
sion on the post ; he had seen it hap- 
pen to her husband. Yet could he 
honestly blame her? It wasn’t her 
fault; just the irony of circum- 
stance. And Tchassen knew that his 
anger now was primarily envy, be- 
cause she had turned to the Ser- 
geant for protection and not to him. 

He made himself relax. “Hys- 
teria,” he said, “is a luxury none of 
us can afford.” 

“You’re right,” Tynia answered. 
“Absolutely right. I was very fool- 
ish.” 

She moved away and Briggan 
muttered, “Sorry, sir. I di^’t 
think' — 

“We must get back to the coast,” 
Tchassen said briskly, “through ter- 
ritory occupied by the enemy. We 
can scrape together all the weapons 

THE EARTHAAAN 



we’ll need and the roads are sup- 
posed to be passable. Our only 
problem, then, is transportation.” 
“Maybe we’d better stay here,” 
Tynia suggested. 

“Sitting ducks for the Earthmen 
to attack?” 

“You said we have weapons.” 
“Not enough to hold out indef- 
initely.” 

“Sir,” Corporal Drein intervened, 
“there’s an old, enemy vehicle in the 
prison building. We used it some- 
times for field inspections.” 

“Let’s look it over.” 

Captain Tchassen had seen the 
instructional films which were made 
immediately after the occupation. 
He could identify the sedan — an in- 
efficient, petroleum-burning ma- 
chine, typical of a primitive people 
who had just reached the thresh- 
hold of the Power Age. The original 
beauty of design had long since dis- 
appeared. Only one window and 
the windshield were unbroken; the 
body paint was peeling away in 
spreading patches of rust ; the 
pneumatic tires were in shreds and 
the vehicle moved noisily on bent, 
metal rims. 

They fueled the car with gasoline 
confiscated long ago and stored in 
drums in the prison warehouse; 
Corporal Drein volunteered to do 
the driving. In the officers’ cottages 
they found weapons — a portable 
heat beam, half a dozen dispersal 
rays, and a box of recharge car- 
tridges. In terms of Tchassen’s tech- 
nology such weapons were minor 
sidearms, but they were superior to 
anything yet produced by the Earth 
people. Tchassen was sure he had 
the power to beat off any attack. 

45 




The survivors were handicapped 
in only one respect : all the food on 
the post had been destroyed with 
the commissary. However, Tchassen 
did not consider that a serious 
problem. He was sure they could 
reach the coast by the following 
morning. 

Shortly before three o’clock — 
nearly two hours after the supply 
robot crashed — the survivors left 
the station. They headed west on a 
highway unused since the conquest. 
Tchassen and Tynia sat together in 
back. The Captain kept all the 
weapons. Briggan’s warning 
couldn’t be ignored; one of the 
other three might be an Earthman. 
Unless they faced an actual emer- 
gency, Tchassen did not intend to 
let any of the others carry arms. 



T he sedan lumbered over 
cracked and crumbling asphalt. 
The tireless rims made a nerve- 
wracking din that prevented all 
conversation. Tchassen was unused 
to any sort of surface transportation. 
The civilized galaxy had outgrown 
it centuries ago; the flight beam, 
safe and inexpensive, was universal- 
ly used. With equal ease the beam 
could move a one-man runabout or 
a cargo freighter over any distance 
— a few feet or the light years gap- 
ping between planets. Twice Tchas- 
sen revised his estimate of the 
sedan’s speed. At this rate, it would 
be twenty-four hours or more before 
they reached the coast. That made 
their shortage of food far more sig- 
nificant. 

Through the shattered side win- 
dow Tchassen scanned the arid soil. 

46 



It was remotely possible that they 
might stumble across a native food 
cache, but he couldn’t count on 
that. He wasn’t even sure the caches 
existed, although the theory was a 
basic factor in the occupation 
policy. 

The galactic council of scientists 
estimated that one-tenth of the 
Earth people had never been 
rounded up and resettled in the 
prison compounds; bandit raids in- 
creased that number steadily. How 
the rebels survived no one knew, 
for any large scale food production 
would have been spotted by the 
patrols and wiped out. One or two 
crackpot theorists said the bandits 
fed themselves by hunting wild 
game, but that was absurd. It was 
common fact throughout the civil- 
ized galaxy that any culture which 
evolved as far as the Power Age 
would, in the normal process of 
growth, eliminate all planetary ani- 
mal life. The accepted explanation 
was the food cache theory. Accord- 
ing to it, the Earthmen — sometime 
after the conquest and before the 
prison compounds were set up — 
had raided their own cities and hid- 
den the packaged food in remote 
mountain areas. The supply was de- 
cidedly limited. When it was gone, 
the rebels faced starvation unless 
they returned voluntarily to the 
compounds. 

The Sierra range between the 
Nevada station and the coast had 
become a haven for so many es- 
caped Earthmen that the region 
was marked “enemy territory” on 
the occupation maps. Although 
Tchassen was aware of that, he 
knew he could not assume that, 

IRVING COX, JR. 




because the four survivors had to 
pass through a rebel area, they 
would discover a cache of food. 
Far too many organized expeditions, 
sent out expressly for that purpose, 
had returned empty handed. 

As the afternoon shadows length- 
ened and the sedan seemed to be 
moving no closer to the snow- 
capped peaks, the air became cold- 
er. Tchassen’s naked chest was 
studded with gooseflesh. Drein and 
Briggan were rubbing their arms to 
keep warm. Tchassen was accus- 
tomed to the controlled tempera- 
tures on the civilized worlds and the 
comforts of the beam ships. It 
hadn’t occurred to him that the 
regular military imiform might be 
inadequate. 

He felt the subtle pulsing of fear, 
the crushing loneliness of a stranger 
on an alien world. He fingered die 
barrel of a dispersal ray, but the 
weapon gave him no sense of se- 
curity. He had a terrible sensation 
of psychological nakedness. The 
weapons could drive off bandits, 
but what protection did Tchassen 
have against the unknown elements 
of a savage world? We’ve failed; 
we have no right to be here: the 
words lashed at his mind like an 
insinuating poison. He could feel 
sweat on his face and chest, sweat 
turning cold in the icy wind. 

Now the sedan entered a decay- 
ing village nestled close to the 
mountains. It was in an amazingly 
good state of repair — undoubtedly 
because it was located so far from 
the coastal cities that it had escaped 
destruction during the invasion. 
Then, too, the village was too close 

THE EARTHMAN 



to the Nevada compound for the 
Earth people to have looted it. 
Tchassen tapped on Drein’s shoul- 
der and ordered him to stop the 
sedan. 

“We need warmer clothing,” the 
Captain explained, “before we start 
up the grade.” 

“I suppose we might pick up 
something here,” Sergeant Briggan 
conceded. “This place is called 
Reno. It was one of the few com- 
munities still intact after the inva- 
sion.” 

“I’m scared,” Tynia said. “The 
prisoners may be hiding here, wait- 
ing for us.” 

“They have better sense than to 
face a dispersal ray without any 
protection.” Tchassen’s tone was 
crisp with an assurance he didn’t 
feel, but it satisfied her. Drein 
opened the door and stood on the 
sidewalk, waiting for Tchassen to 
hand out one of the weapons. But 
Tchassen couldn’t be sure Drein 
was not an Earthman; nor, on the 
other hand, could he ask the Cor- 
poral to explore an enemy town un- 
armed. As a sort of compromise, 
Tchassen said, 

“We’ll stick together; I’ll carry 
all the weapons. Corporal.” 

It wasn’t satisfactory, but both 
Drein and Briggan were too well- 
disciplined to protest. Tchassen felt 
foolish with six dispersal rays and a 
heat beam slung over his shoulders, 
but he couldn’t risk leaving any- 
thing in the sedan, either. 

The survivors spent a good part 
of an hour searching the downtown 
stores, but Reno had been stripped 
of native artifacts; the buildings 

47 




were empty shells filled with dust. 
The only chance they had of finding 
clothing was to look in the private 
homes closer to the outskirts. They 
went back to the sedan and drove 
to a residential street. By that time 
the sun was setting. Tchassen did 
not relish the prospect of being 
caught in an enemy town after 
dark, but the search could be 
speeded up only if they separated. 

For a second time the Captain 
compromised. He issued dispersal 
rays to the others, but insisted that 
they work in pairs. If one of them 
was an enemy, that arrangement 
would more or less tie his hands. 
Tynia volunteered to go with 
Drein; Tchassen felt a pang of envy 
and jealousy, but he had better 
sense than to use his authority to 
force her to come with him. 

Tchassen and the Sergeant 
searched through half a dozen 
houses before they found one that 
had not been looted. Their luck was 
unbelievable, for they found shelves 
of canned food as well as clothing 
sealed in plastic bags. From an open 
window the Captain fired a dis- 
persal ray toward the sky, a signal 
prearranged with the others. As the 
needle of light arched above the vil- 
lage, Tchassen heard a distant blast 
of explosions and Tynia’s shrill 
scream of terror. 

“It’s a bandit raid!” Briggan 
cried. He turned to run toward the 
street. Tchassen’s hand shot out 
and caught the Sergeant’s shoulder. 

“Not so fast. I said we’d stay in 
pairs.” 

“But Tynia’s in trouble! The 
Earth people are barbarians, sir. 
They give no quarter. They — ** 

48 



“I’m still in command, Ser- 
geant.” 

Briggan stiffened. “Yes, sir.” 

The two men walked toward the 
source of the sound. Tchassen 
couldn’t allow himself to run, even 
to help Tynia; the extertion would 
have been too much for him. There 
was another clatter of shots and 
Tchassen recognized the gunfire of 
the primitive Earth weapons. In the 
darkness it was vaguely disturbing, 
but not frightening. Both Tynia and 
Drein were armed with dispersal 
rays; they would have no trouble 
defending themselves. 

Sudden footsteps pelted toward 
them. Tynia ran from a dark side 
street and threw herself into the 
Captain’s arms. She clung to him, 
trembling and panting for breath. 

“Where’s Drein?” he demanded. 

“The Corporal — he took my gun. 
He tried to kill me!” 

“Tynia, do you understand what 
you’re saying? The accusation — ” 

“You told us to stay together. I 
did my best. I was going through a 
house when I realized suddenly that 
I was alone. I saw Drein outside; I 
thought he was talking to someone. 
I ran out and — ” She bit her lip 
and hid her eyes against his shoul- 
der. 

In a flat, emotionless voice, 
Tchassen asked, “Drein was with 
Earthmen?” 

“I don’t know! Someone sprang 
at me and knocked the ray out of 
my hands. I saw people — I thought 
I saw people — in the shadows be- 
hind Corporal Drein. I be^an to 
run. I don’t want to accuse him of 
— of anything, Captain. I can’t be 
sure. If he’s an Earthman, we have 

IRVING COX, JR. 




to — ^we have to dispose of him, and 
I wouldn’t want — ” 

Her voice trailed off in a gasp of 
terror as they heard a new burst 
of gunfire, very close. Tchassen 
dodged aside, pulling Tynia behind 
a tree. Sergeant Briggan fired blind- 
ly into the night. His dispersal beam 
danced across the face of a frame 
building and the house exploded 
into flame. In the red glare of the 
fire, Tchassen saw a band of sav- 
ages, dressed in animal hides — no 
that was impossible! — ^fleeing into 
the darkness beyond the village. 

Corporal Drein staggered toward 
them. Blood spilled from a gash 
tom in his chest. He saw Tchassen, 
Tynia and the Sergeant standing 
together. Like a man in a daze, he 
began to raise his dispersal ray. 

In Tchassen’s mind there was no 
longer any room for doubt; the 
tmth was clear. Drein was an 
Earthman ; Drein had betrayed the 
station; Drein now intended to kill 
off the only survivors. The Captain 
acted with military decision. He 
pressed the firing stud of his weap- 
on. Drein screamed in agony as he 
died. 

Tynia buried her face in her 
hands. Briggan put his arm around 
her. In the flickering light, Tchas- 
sen saw the Sergeant grin. 

“You didn’t have to kill him, 
Captain,” Tynia whispered. 

“After what you told me — 

“Don’t blame me; I didn’t do 
anything!” 

“He was going to fire at us, 
wasn’t he?” 

“You don’t know that for sure. 
Maybe he was asking for help!” 

Tchassen shrugged ; there was no

accounting for the emotional in- 
consistencies of a woman. 

“What did you e^^ect to prove 
by murdering Drein?” Briggan 
asked. 

“I saved us from — 

“If he was an Earthman, why 
were the bandits firing at him? 
Why had they wounded him?” 

“To make it look good,” Tchas- 
sen replied, no longer really believ- 
ing it himself. “They wanted our 
weapons; they have to use trickery 
to get them away from us.” 

Tchassen slid the weapon out of 
Drein’s lifeless fingers and half- 
heartedly searched the street for 
Tynia’s dispersal ray. He didn’t 
expect to find it. The Earth people 
had it now. The loss of the weapon 
was, in one sense, more serious than 
the destruction of the Nevada sta- 
tion. A prison compound could be 
rebuilt and restaffed. But if the 
Earth ever faced the conqueror with 
equal firepower, Earthmen would 
recapture their world — and more. 

We’ve failed ; we have no right to 
be here — the Captain fought a 
burning nausea as the fear washed 
over his mind. What had they ac- 
complished by the occupation? The 
Earth was neither enslaved nor 
destroyed. Hatred made the natives 
savages. They would never be con- 
tent until they had revenge. They 
never conceded defeat; they never 
would. Corporal Drein seemed to 
be typical of their fanaticism, and 
that was why Tchassen had killed 
him — that, and the hysterical story 
Tynia had told. On calmer reflec- 
tion, Tchassen knew he had no 
proof of Drein’s disloyalty — ^which 
meant that either Briggan or Tynia 

49 




could be Earth natives. That prob- 
lem was unsolved; the danger was 
undiminished. 



T CHASSEN wasted very lit- 
tle time looking for the weapon 
Tynia had lost. After twenty min- 
utes, the three survivors returned to 
the house where Tchassen and Brig- 
gan had found food and clothing. 
TTiey packed the canned goods into 
the sedan and put on warm coats 
and jackets. Although the woolens 
and the cottons fell to pieces when 
they touched the cloth, the synthetic 
fabrics were still relatively sound, 
particularly when they had been 
sealed in mothproof plastic. 

Tchassen took over the driving 
when they left Reno. For greater 
warmth, Tynia and the Sergeant 
crowded into the front seat beside 
him. As they ascended the grade 
toward the pass, the air turned 
much colder. Tchassen’s hands felt 
numb on the wheel and the altitude 
made his mind swim in a haze of 
vague nausea. 

There was no moon and the 
headlights of the sedan had been 
smashed long ago. The Captain 
drove very slowly, concentrating on 
the curves of the highway. Three 
times the machine narrowly missed 
going over the edge; the guard rail 
saved them. Tchassen knew he was 
risking their lives to drive at night, 
but he had no alternative. They 
would not be really safe again until 
they reached the base on the coast, 
and the Earth people would try to 
prevent that. They would try to 
make sure that no survivors lived to 
report what had happened at the 

50 



Nevada station. 

Briggan fished three cans of food 
out of the back of the car and 
blasted them open with his dispersal 
ray. The can he handed Tchassen 
contained a fruit in a heavy, sickly 
sweet syrup. Tchassen made himself 
empty the tin. Tynia had a pinkish 
meat which she was totally unable 
to choke down. The civilized ga- 
laxy had been vegetarian for two 
thousand years; a clear indication 
of the savagery of the Earth cul- 
ture was the fact that the natives 
still ate animal flesh. Briggan 
opened another can for Tynia. 
After a brief hesitation, he began to 
eat the meat himself. 

Tynia gagged and looked away. 
“I don’t see how you can do it, 
Sergeant.” 

“We may be on the road longer 
than we think,” he answered. “We 
can’t afford to waste anything; we 
aren’t likely to find another food 
cache.” 

Tchassen glanced at Briggan 
suspiciously. It was possible that he 
could force himself to stomach the 
meat, if he were starving, but how 
was he able to eat it now? An 
Earthman could do it; yet if Brig- 
gan were at native, wasn’t he too 
clever to give himself away with 
anything so trivial? 

“Tell me. Captain,” Briggan 
asked, “what chance do we have of 
getting through this alive?” 

“We’re armed; we have trans- 
portation; we — ” 

“And the natives will risk every- 
thing to stop us. They have to. This 
attack on the Nevada station was 
the beginning of the revolution. If 
they plan the rest of it as carefully, 

IRVING COX, JR. 




they stand a good chance of throw- 
ing us off the Earth.” 

“No!” Tynia cried. “Now that 
they know the civilized galaxy ex- 
ists, they’ll build space ships and 
come after us. With our weap- 
ons — ■ 

“Plus their fanaticism,” Tchassen 
put in, “the galaxy doesn’t stand a 
chance.” 

“But we invaded the Earth to 
prevent that; we came here to teach 
them to live civilized lives.” 

“How much teaching have we 
actually done in the compounds?” 
the Sergeant demanded. “How 
many Earth people have listened to 
us?” 

“They’re human beings; they 
have brains like ours. Surely when 
we have explained our ways to them 
logically and sanely — ” 

“The trouble is,” Tchassen said 
thoughtfully, “it’s our logic, not 
theirs. If you look at this from the 
point of view of an Earthman, you 
see us as savage invaders of their 
world.” 

“Our purpose makes it different.” 
“We say that, but the Earth peo- 
ple wouldn’t understand us.” 

“It’s very strange,” Sergeant 
Briggan said quietly, “that you un- 
derstand the Earthman’s point of 
view so well, Captain Tchassen. 
Let’s see. You’ve been here — ^how 
many days?” 

“Five.” 

“But you set yourself up as an 
authority on these people.” 

“Gome now. Sergeant. I didn’t 
say that. I’m simply trying to un- 
derstand them reasonably.” 

“To think like an Earthman: 
that’s rather difficult for us to do, 

THE EARTHAAAN 



Captain.” Briggan paused briefly 
before he snapped out a rapid ques- 
tion, “Where were you stationed 
before you came here. Captain?” 

“At security headquarters.” 
“Assigned to what staff?” 

“Well, I was—” Tchassen 
glanced at Tynia. It would do no 
good, now, to explain why he had 
been assigned to the Nevada post. 
All that was finished because the 
station staff died in the explosion. 
“I wasn’t on any staff,” he said. “1 
was working on my own.” 

“That’s a pity, sir. You wouldn’t 
remember the name of your com- 
manding officer, then; I could have 
checked up on that.” 

Tynia gasped; only then did 
Tchassen realize what Briggan’s 
questions implied. He said coldly, 
“You’re way off the track, Briggan. 
I’m the only one of you who 
couldn’t be an Earthman; I haven’t 
become acclimated yet — that’s ob- 
vious, isn’t it?” 

“Of course you’re right, sir. It 
wouldn’t be the sort of thing you 
could put over by playing a part, 
would it? Besides, Drein was the 
Earthman and you killed him. 
We’ve no reason to be suspicious of 
each other now, have we?” 

There was no way Tchassen 
could reply. He gritted his teeth 
and said nothing. From the expres- 
sion on Tynia’s face, he realized 
that Briggan’s insinuation had been 
rather effective. And suppose Brig- 
gan actually believed it himself. 
Didn’t that rule out the Sergeant 
as an Earthman? 

And it left only Tynia. Tchassen 
eyed the dark-haired woman on the 
seat beside him. What did he really 

51 




know about her?— only that she 
had been married to a station com- 
mander; and had flirted outrage- 
ously with other post officers. She 
may have done it simply because 
she was bored; on the other hand, 
it could have been a deliberate at- 
tempt to create friction — exactly the 
sort of thing an Earth woman might 
try to do. Perhaps she was a native. 
When Tchassen was given the 
security assignment, he hadn’t 
checked into her background; it 
didn’t seem necessary. He realized 
suddenly that Tynia was the only 
witness against Drein. Because of 
what she had said, Tchassen had 
killed the Corporal. Tynia’s hysteria 
had set the stage for murder. 

As the sedan climbed higher into 
the pass, it moved more slowly. The 
motor coughed and wheezed; once 
or twice it seemed ready to stop 
altogether. When they reached the 
summit, the tenuous crescent of a 
new moon emerged above the pines. 
In the pale glow of light, Tchassen 
saw that the highway was covered 
with a treacherous sheet of ice. 

The metal rims found no trac- 
tion. When the machine began to 
skid, the Captain found he could 
neither control it nor stop it. In 
spite of the cold, his body was cov- 
ered with sweat. 

At a point four or five miles be- 
yond the summit, they came to a 
place where thick trees on both 
sides of the highway shaded the 
road so the sun never reached it. 
The ice was continuous for a hun- 
dred feet or more, and it was cov- 
ered with three inches of unmelted 
snow. The sedan skidded out of 



control. Tynia screamed and hid 
her face in her hands. Tchassen 
fought the wheel futilely. The car 
spun toward the shoulder, banged 
against a tree, and slid across the 
road into a clearing in front of an 
abandoned building. 

In the sudden silence Tchassen 
heard nothing but the whisper of 
icy wind in the. trees. He opened 
the door and looked at the deserted 
building. The roofs of the smaller 
structures nearby had collapsed un- 
der the pressure of winter snows, 
but the main building, sheltered by 
tall pines, was in good repair. 

“We’d be warmer inside,” Tchas- 
sen suggested. “In the morning after 
the sun comes out — ” 

“Captain!” Briggan broke in. 
“We must reach the coast!” 

“ — after the sun comes out, the 
ice on the road should begin to 
melt; the driving will be much 
easier.” 

“Don’t you realize, sir — ^these 
mountains are enemy territory?” 
“We’re still well-armed. Ser- 
geant.” 

“We had the rays in Reno, too, 
but Drein’s dead.” 

“I tell you we’ll be safe here. I 
remember a trick I saw demon- 
strated at the school of tactics.” 
“You security men have the ad- 
vantage. I’m just an enlisted non- 
com. I never went to the military 
schools and learned any fancy 
tricks, but I know I have a duty 
to reach the coast and report what’s 
happened.” 

Tynia took Briggan’s arm. “The 
sedan won’t run, Sergeant. Surely 
you aren’t saying we have to 
walk—” 



52 



IRVING COX, JR. 




“It’s interesting, isn’t it, that the 
car stopped right here — in front of 
a place where it would be so con- 
venient for us to spend the night?” 
“What do you mean, Briggan?” 
“I wasn’t doing the driving, 
Tynia.” 

A hard knot of anger exploded in 
Tchassen’s mind, but he held his 
temper. It was easier to ignore 
Briggan than to answer his sus- 
picion. In a tone that concealed his 
feelings, the Captain said, “Let me 
show you what I saw them do in the 
demonstration, Sergeant.” He slid 
out of the sedan. With numb fin- 
gers, he opened the firing box of the 
portable heat ray and took out one 
of the two thermal coils. Breaking 
the seal, he began to unwind the 
thin thread of wire. 

“We have our own alarm system 
right here,” he explained, trying to 
convey more enthusiasm than he 
really felt. “Nearly a quarter mile 
of wire. We’ll string it in a circle 
around this clearing, six inches 
above the ground. The natives will 
never notice it. If they attack us, 
they’ll snap the wire and set off 
the thermal reaction. We’ll be sur- 
rounded for a second or two in a 
blazing ring of fire.” 

“Maybe it’ll work. Captain.” 

The two men strung the wire 
while Tynia lugged the weapons 
and the canned goods into the 
abandoned building. When the Ser- 
geant and Tchassen went inside, 
they found that she had started a 
fire in a pot-bellied stove. The Cap- 
tain stood holding his hands over 
the flames and gradually he began 
to feel warm again. He knew that 

THE EARTHMAN 



the pillar of smoke rising from the 
chimney might invite an attack by 
the natives, but there was also a 
good chance that the smoke would 
disperse before it could be spotted. 

The warmth of the fire acted like 
an opiate, but Tchassen realized he 
didn’t dare risk falling asleep. Tynia 
or Briggan might be Earth people, 
waiting for the chance to finish the 
job they had begun when the Ne- 
vada station was destroyed. After 
a brief hesitation, the Captain took 
another shock capsule from his belt 
pouch and choked it down. The 
drug would keep him awake, al- 
though it was dangerous to take a 
second capsule so soon after the 
first; there were sometimes emo- 
tional side-affects which were un- 
pleasant. 

“One of us should stay on 
guard,” Briggan said. “We could 
take turns at it, Captain — two hour 
stints until dawn.” 

“Good idea, Briggan. I’ll stand 
the first watch.” 

“I was going to volunteer — 

“No ; you’re tired ; you and 
Tynia need your sleep.” 

“You’re too considerate of us. 
Captain.” The overtone in Brig- 
gan’s voice suggested far more than 
he actually said. He lay back on his 
blankets, but he did not shut his 
eyes, and he put his dispersal ray 
across his belly with his hand on 
the firing stud. Tchassen stood up, 
sliding a weapon over each shoul- 
der. 

He went through a connecting 
hall into a narrow room. A few 
scattered dishes, overlooked by the 
looters, and built-in cooking ma- 
chines indicated that this had been 



53 




a restaurant. The room gave him 
an excellent vantage point, for the 
windows, still unbroken, provided 
a broad view of the highway and 
the clearing in front of the building. 

The restaurant was bitterly cold. 
Tchassen pulled the rough, fibrous 
clothing tight around his shoulders, 
but it felt irritating rather than 
warm. He looked out on the ice and 
the snow and the pines, and he was 
acutely conscious of the savage 
alienness of Earth. 

Snow he knew as a scientific 
curiosity; he had seen it created in 
laboratory experiments. Nowhere 
in the civilized galaxy did it exist as 
a natural phenomenon. The teem- 
ing billions of people crowding 
every world could not survive unless 
every square inch of soil was oc- 
cupied and exploited. Science regi- 
mented the temperatures in the 
same way that it controlled rainfall. 
For more than twenty centuries 
neither deserts nor Arctic wastes 
had existed. All animal species had 
disappeared. Trees survived only 
as ornamental growths in city 
parks. The Earth was a relic of the 
past, a barbaric museum piece. The 
strong, individualistic genius of its 
people had evolved in no other so- 
ciety; and that genius had created 
a technology which mushroomed 
far beyond the capacity to control 
it. It gave this savage world atomic 
power before it had planetary unity. 

For that reason, the civilized 
galaxy had invaded the Earth. They 
could do nothing else. The decision 
had been made long before Tchas- 
sen was bom. The galactic council 
of scientists studied the Earth and 
argued the meaning of their ob- 

54 



servations for a quarter of a century 
before they ordered the invasion. 
War, to the civilized galaxy, was 
unthinkable ; yet the government 
had no alternative. For, with even 
their primitive form of atomic pow- 
er, the Earth people could blow 
their world to dust. The planet had 
to be occupied to save the natives 
from the consequences of their own 
folly. 

But what does it matter, Tchas- 
sen thought bitterly, if our inten- 
tions were noble and unselfish? It’s 
what Earth thinks we meant to do 
that counts. And by that standard 
we’ve failed. We have no right to be 
here. 

Alone in the cold darkness of the 
abandoned restaurant, Tchassen 
faced the fear gnawing at his soul. 
The drug he had taken warped his 
depression into a crushing weight of 
melancholy. The occupation of the 
Earth had gone wrong — or so it 
seemed to him — because the council 
of scientists misjudged the native 
mentality. True, these people had 
created a brilliant technology, but 
it didn’t follow that they would 
comprehend the social forces at 
work in the civilized galaxy. Their 
emotional reactions were at best 
on an adolescent level; intelligence 
alone would not lift them up to ma- 
turity. The prisoners in the com- 
pounds learned nothing but hatred ; 
they lived for nothing but revenge. 
Vividly Tchassen saw the night- 
mare of the future: the time when 
the savages on the Earth had weap- 
ons to match the dispersal ray; the 
time when they would be able to 
build ships that could invade the 
civilized galaxy. 



IRVING COX, JR. 




HE CAPTAIN paced the dusty 
flcx)r in front of the serving 
counter. Briggan did not come in 
two hours to take over the watch; 
and he made no attempt to call the 
Sergeant. It was long after mid- 
night, perhaps less than an hour 
before dawn, when something out- 
side triggered the thermal-wire 
alarm. Simultaneously, as the blaze 
of white glared against the restau- 
rant windows, Tynia screamed. 
Tchassen heard the explosive blast 
of a dispersal ray slashing into 
wood. A split-second later Tynia 
burst through the connecting hall 
and flung herself into Tchassen’s 
arms. 

“They’re attacking!” she 
screamed. 

“You saw them? Where?” 
“Briggan. At the window. I — I 
shot him.” 

His fingers bit into the soft flesh 
of her arm. “Take it easy, Tynia. 
Tell me how it happened.” 

“I saw him when the alarm went 
off. He was lifting his dispersal ray, 
as if he meant to shoot you. I re- 
membered how he had eaten meat 
last night, and I — I thought — 
She shuddered. “I knew he was an 
Earthman. He was the one who 
blew up the supply robot; now he 
wants to kill us.” 

“You were sure Drein was an 
Earthman, too.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” 
“Obvious?” She shrank back 
against the counter. 

He ignored her but kept her 
within the range of his peripheral 
vision while he glanced through 
the window, trying to locate what 

THE EARTHMAN 



had set off* the alarm. The circle of 
heat had melted all the snow and 
ice in the clearing; the trunks of 
the pines were smoldering and a 
comer of the building was begin- 
ning to bum. 

Tchassen saw a chunk of flesh 
lying on the road — an animal of 
some sort which had blundered into 
the alarm wire. Then they had not 
been attacked by natives. The dead 
animal made it very clear that wild 
beasts still survived on the Earth. 
No wonder the natives were meat 
eaters! And, since they were, that 
meant they could live indefinitely in 
the remote mountain areas. They 
did not depend upon hidden caches 
of food; starvation would never 
drive them back to the prison com- 
pounds. The occupation policy was 
based upon a false assumption; 
more than ever it was vitally im- 
perative for Tchassen to reach the 
coast and report the tmth to his 
superiors. 

Tchassen shifted his weapon so 
that his fingers lay on the firing 
stud. Tynia stared at him, her eyes 
wide with terror. In a tight whisper, 
she said, 

“Then you — ^you’re the Earth- 
man, Captain!” 

He grinned, admiring her skill- 
ful use of emotion. If he hadn’t 
known better, he would have taken 
her fear for the real thing. Maybe 
it was ; he couldn’t be sure, but the 
facts seemed to add up to only one 
answer. Tynia laid the groundwork 
for the killing of Corporal Drein; 
she herself shot Briggan. And who 
had been in a better position to 
tamper with the landing beam for 
the supply rocket? Who else had 




55 




a better opportunity to destroy the 
transmitter in the emergency pill- 
box? Yet, even in the face of so 
much evidence, Tchassen gave her 
the benefit of the doubt! his rea- 
soning might have been colored by 
the drug he had taken. 

With the mouth of his weapon, 
he nudged her toward the hall. ‘*Go 
back and pick up the food, Tynia. 
We’re leaving here now.” 

She clenched her fist over her 
mouth. “Don’t turn me over to 
them. Captain. Let me go. I’ve 
never done you Earth people any 
harm.” 

Magnificent acting! No wonder 
they had sent her to the Nevada 
station. “We’re heading for the 
coast,” he explained. 

‘‘The sedan wouldn’t go last 
night; it won’t now, either.” 
“We’ll push the car back to the 
highway. The downgrade is steep 
enough to make the machine run 
without power. If that doesn’t work, 
we can always walk.” 

“It’ll be warmer if we wait until 
daylight.” 

“And the natives would be here 
by that time, too, wouldn’t they? 
The glare of the thermal explosion 
was visible for miles.” 

“I didn’t sleep at all last night, 
Captain. I don’t have the energy 
to—” 

With the dispersal ray, he pushed 
her along the hall toward the room 
where she and Briggan had slept 
in front of the pot-bellied stove. 
Naturally she would try to keep him 
there, he thought; he didn’t need 
much more proof of her disloyalty. 

Flames from the burning wall lit 
the room. As they entered, Tynia 

56 



screamed and fell back against 
Tchassen. 

“The Sergeant’s gone!” she 
gasped. 

“Along with the weapons you 
left in here.” 

“Then he — he’s the Earthman, 
Captain; you aren’t!” 

“You said you’d shot him.” 

“I fired at him. I saw him fall. 
I thought he was dead.” 

Tchassen wanted to believe her, 
but the husky, deep-throated ap- 
peal in her voice couldn’t quite de- 
stroy the hard core of his doubt. 
This could be an alibi which she 
could have contrived for herself. 
She might have hidden the weapons 
as well as Briggan’s body. If Tchas- 
sen believed her, if he let himself 
trust her, it would be easier later 
on for her to dispose of him. 

“Pack up the food, Tynia; I’m 
going to see if I can start the car.” 

When he went outside, the dawn 
was brightening the eastern sky. 
The snow and ice, melted by the 
thermal fire, made a slushy sheet 
of water in the clearing; it ate at the 
drifts, sluggishly washing the snow 
into the highway. 

Tchassen waded through the wa- 
ter toward the sedan. His boots 
kept him dry, but the cold pene- 
trated and made his feet numb. 
Hidden by the water were tiny, 
unmelted puddles of ice which 
made very treacherous footing. 
Twice the Captain slipped and 
nearly went down. 

He was twenty feet from the car 
when he heard the door of the 
building bang open behind him. He 
glanced back, calling Tynia a wam- 

IRVING COX, JR. 




ing to be careful of the hidden ice. 
At the same time she screamed. 
Tchassen swung aside instinctively. 
He slipped and fell. From the back 
of the sedan a thread of energy 
snaked toward him. Tchassen felt 
the momentary pain stab at his 
shoulder; then nothing. He lay flat 
in the icy water, fighting the red 
haze that hung over his mind. If 
the dispersal ray had come half an 
inch closer to his heart, it would 
have cut the artery and killed him. 

Sergeant Briggan opened the 
door of the sedan and stood leaning 
against it, holding a dispersal ray 
in his left hand. The Sergeant was 
badly wounded. His right arm was 
an unrecognizable, bleeding pulp; 
he was too weak to stand alone. So 
Tynia had told the truth, Tchassen 
thought ; she actually had shot him. 
The Captain felt a surge of relief 
and hope. Perhaps he could rely on 
Tynia, after all. But now it was too 
late! The blast from the Sergeant’s 
weapon had paralyzed Tchassen’s 
motor control; he was helpless. 

The Sergeant, obviously, assumed 
that Tchassen was dead. Ignoring 
him, he ordered Tynia to pile the 
canned food in the back of the 
sedan. She moved toward him 
slowly. 

“You’re the Earthman,” she said 
dully. “And I thought Captain 
Tchassen — ” 

“The farce is over, Tynia. You 
and Tchassen made a fine game of 
it far a while, but I’ve been in the 
service long enough to spot a fake 
security officer.” 

“The Captain and I?” she re- 
peated. 

“Do I have to draw you a blue- 
THE EARTHAAAN 



print? You two are in this together. 
You’re both natives.” 

For a moment she seemed to re- 
cover her self-assurance. “So that’s 
how you’re going to play it. Ser- 
geant. Just who do you think you’ll 
take in with such nonsense?” 

“I’m through batting words 
around with you, Tynia. Put the 
food in the car. Help me push the 
machine out to the road.” 

“Why bother, Sergeant? If you 
stay right here, the natives will be 
along soon enough.” 

“I’m glad you admit that, Ty- 
nia.” Briggan laughed sourly. “But 
it’s my duty to get through to the 
base — ^just as it’s your duty, I sup- 
pose, to try to stop me.” 

“Why do you still want to make 
me believe that. Sergeant? What 
difference does it make now?” 
Tchassen, paralyzed and unable 
to speak, suddenly realized the 
truth. Each of them feared the 
other. All four surviviors had as- 
sumed that one of the others had 
to be an Earthman. We put our 
faith in machines, he thought; we 
were too certain that the robot ship 
couldn’t crash simply because some- 
thing had gone wrong with the 
beam. Our real trouble is we have 
no faith in ourselves. None of us 
was an Earthman; the Earth people 
had nothing to do with the de- 
struction of the Nevada station. 

He wanted desperately to shout 
that out. After a supreme effort, he 
was able to make his lips move a 
fraction of an inch; and that was 
all. 

Tynia put the canned food in the 
sedan. Briggan waved her to the 
back of the car with his weapon. 

57 




He held the beam leveled at her 
while she pushed the sedan toward 
the road. The clearing was built on 
a slight slant and she had no trouble 
moving the heavy vehicle. As the 
wheels began to turn, Tynia pre- 
tended to slip and fall into the 
slushy water. 

Briggan was distracted by the 
motion of the sedan. Tynia rolled 
toward Tchassen and snatched up 
his dispersal ray. The Sergeant real- 
ized what she intended to do and 
lifted his weapon awkwardly in his 
left hand. 

No! Stop! Don’t be fools! The 
words sang through Tchassen’s 
mind, but he could not speak. Brig- 
gan and Tynia fired simultaneously. 
The beam caught the Sergeant 
squarely in the face. He died in a 
blaze of energy. The sedan rolled 
into the road and Tynia fell un- 
conscious beside Tchassen. 

He wanted to help her, but he 
was still not able to move. In an- 
other half hour the paralysis would 
be gone, but by that time it would 
be too late to do anything for 
Tynia. Furiously he drove his body 
to respond and he managed to turn 
on his side. 

The exertion was too much for 
him. The haze swam in painful 
waves across his mind. Just before 
unconsciousness came, he saw a 
band of natives on the edge of the 
clearing. 

The swaying motion of the 
stretcher shook him awake. The 
Earthmen were carrying him along 
a narrow mountain trail, past deep 
drifts of snow. His wound, where 
Briggan’s beam had hit him, was 

58 



neatly bandaged; he could smell 
the odor of a disinfectant. It sur- 
prised him that the Earth people 
knew so much about medicine; but 
it surprised him more that they had 
tried to save his life. 

He listened to his captors when 
they talked. He was able to under- 
stand a few phrases of the native 
dialect which every man assigned 
to the occupation had to learn, but 
what he had been taught was sadly 
inadequate. When one of his 
stretcher bearers saw that the Cap- 
tain was conscious, he spoke to him 
in the cultured language of the 
civilized galaxy. The syntax was 
awkwardly handled, yet Tchassen 
was amazed that the Earthman 
used it so well. 

‘‘Be no fear,” the native said. 
“You get living again.” 

“Tynia. The girl with me — ” 
“Wound bad ; she dead before we 
come. We follow from prison and 
try help all four you. You light each 
other. You have evil weapons. We 
can save only you.” 

“What are you going to do with 
me?” 

“Make you well ; send you back.” 
The answer came as a shock to 
Tchassen; it was what a civilized 
people would have said. But the 
Earth natives were savages — bril- 
liant, inventive individualists, but 
nonetheless social barbarians. It 
would have seemed much more 
logical if the native had said he was 
keeping Tchassen for a religious 
ceremonial sacrifice. 

“As soon as my wounds are 
healed,” Tchassen repeated, “you’ll 
let me go?” 

The native ran his hand over the 
IRVING COX, JR. 




Captain’s bandages. “This wound 
is a little thing, of no importance.” 
He touched Tchassen’s head. “Here 
is your real sickness, in the brain. 
We teach you how to think like a 
man ; then you go home.” 

“You’re going to teach me? Me? 
Do you realize, I come from the 
civilized galaxy?” Tchassen began 
to laugh; he wondered if he had 
been taken prisoner by a band of 
madmen. 

“We show you how to be hu- 
man,” the native answered blandly. 
“Not fight and kill each other, the 
way you and the others did when 
the post blow up. We know mean- 
ing for civilization; you have none. 
It is easy secret. We learn after the 
invasion, when our world de- 
stroyed. Real civilized people get 
along; live in peace; give help to 



each other. Your people and ours: 
we can be brothers here on the 
Earth, and on your other worlds, 
too.” 

Tchassen’s laughter was touched 
with hysteria. Have we failed? He 
knew the answer now: for the cap- 
tives, the dispossessed men of the 
Earth, would become the teachers 
of the conquerors — and teach them 
what the conquerors had come to 
build on the Earth. No, we have 
not failed; we have simply misun- 
derstood the strange genius of the 
quixotic Earth. The defeated would 
one day rise up and conquer the 
galaxy. Tchassen saw that clearly, 
but no longer in fear. He wanted 
to make their stamina, their grit, 
their ability to survive a part of 
himself. He wanted to make himself 
over — as an Earthman. • • •

T Tying to keep a supercolossal laboratory invisible 



when two curious aliens are poking around can be a 



trying affair for even the most brilliant of minds . 



LABORATORY 

BY JEROME BIXBY 



G OP’S THOUGHTS had the bluish-purple tint of abject 
apology: “They’re landing, Master.” 

Pud looked up from the tiny thig~fie\d he had been 
shaping in his tentacles. “Of course they are,” he thought- 
snapped. “You practically invited them down, didn’t you? 
If you’d only kept a few eyes on the Detector, instead of 
day-dreaming — ” 

“I’m sorry,” Gop said unhappily. “I wasn’t day-dreaming, 
I was observing the magnificent skill and finesse with which 
you shaped the thig. After all, this system is so isolated. No 
one ever came along before ... I just supposed no one 
ever would — 

“A Scientist isn’t supposed to suppose! Until he’s proven 
wrong, he’s supposed to know!^^ Thirty of Pud’s eyes glow- 
ered upward at the tiny alien spaceship, only ninety or so 
miles above the surface of the laboratory-planet and lower- 



60 





ing rapidly. The rest of Pud’s eyes 
— more than a hundred of them, 
set haphazardously in his various- 
sized heads like gurf-seeds on rolls 
— scoured every inch of the planet’s 
visible surface, to make certain that 
no sign of the Vegans’ presence on 
the planet, from the tiniest experi- 
ment to the gigantic servo-mechani- 
cal eating pits, was left operating 
or visible. 

Irritatedly he squelched out of 
existence a yfm-field that had taken 
three weeks of laborious psycho- 
induction to develop. His psycho- 
kineticut stripped it of cohesion, 
and its faint whine-and-crackle 
vanished. 

‘T told you to deactivate all our 
experiments,” he snapped at Gop. 
“Don’t you understand Vegan?” 

Abashed, the Junior Scientist 
lowered his many eyes. 

“I — I’m sorry,” Gop said humbly. 
“I thought the yim might wait until 
the creatures landed. Master . 
perhaps their auditory apparatus 
would not have been sufficient to 
reveal its presence to them, in 
which case the field would not have 
had to be — ” 

“All right, all right,” Pud 
grunted. “I appreciate your point 
. but, dripping mouthfuls, you 
know that any risk of detection is 
too great. You know the regula- 
tions on Contact!” 

“Yes, Master.” 

“Speaking of which, part of your 
seventh head is showing.” 

The Junior Scientist included 
the head in the personal invisibility 
field which he himself was broad- 
casting. 

“Of all the sims in this sector,”

Pud thought, eying the little space- 
ship, “and of all the planets around 
this particular sun, they have to 
choose this one to land on. Chew!” 

Gop flushed. A member of the 
Transverse Colon Revivalists, he 
found Pud’s constant atheistic 
swearing very disturbing. He sighed 
inwardly. Usually at least one of 
Pud’s heads could manage to keep 
its sense of humor, but right now 
all of them were like proton-storms. 
The Senior Scientist was on the 
verge of one of his totalitantrums. 

“They must have sighted flashes 
from our experiments,” Pud went 
on, “before you decided you could 
spare just one set of eyes for the 
Detector!” 

Though both Vegans were in- 
visible to other eyes, they remained 
visible to each other because their 
eyes were adjusted to the wave- 
length of their invisibility fields. By 
the same token, they could see all 
their invisible experiments — a vast 
litter of gadgets, gismos, gargan- 
tuan gimmicks, shining tools, huge 
and infinitesimal instruments, stacks 
of supplies, and various types of 
energy fields, the latter all frozen 
in mid-activity like smudges on a 
pane of glass. The sandy ground 
was the floor of the Vegans’ labora- 
tory; small hills and outcroppings 
of rock were their chairs and work- 
benches. Like a spaceship junkyard, 
or an enormous open-air machinery 
warehouse, the laboratory stretched 
away from the two Scientists in 
every direction to the planetoid’s 
near horizon. 

Pud intensified the general invisi- 
bility field to the last notch, and 

62 



the invisible experiments became 
even more invisible. 

The ^Af^-field was a nameless- 
colored whorl of energy in the 
Senior Scientist’s tentacles. In his 
concern for the other experiments, 
he had forgotten to deactivate it. 
It grew eagerly to the size of a 
back yard, then of a baseball dia- 
mond, then of a traffic oval, and 
one shimmering edge of it touched 
his body, which he had not insu- 
lated. Energy crackled. Pud jumped 
forty feet into the air, swearing, and 
slapped the field into non-existence 
between two tentacles. 

His body, big as an apartment 
house, floated slowly downward in 
the laboratory-planet’s light gravity. 

The tiny alien spaceship touched 
the ground just as he did. The 
rocket flare flickered and died. 

The ship sat on its fins, about 
thirty feet — ^Vegan feet — away. In 
its shining side, a few Vegan inches 
above the still smoking rocket tubes, 
was a small black hole. 

“Master, look!” Gop thought. 
“Their ship is damaged . per- 
haps that’s why they landed!” And 
he started to extend a tentative 
extra-sensory probe through the 
hole. 

Pud lashed out with a probe of 
his own, knocking Gop’s aside be- 
fore it could enter the hole. “Nin- 
compoop! . don’t go esprobing 
until we know if they’re sensitive 
to it or not! Can’t you remember 
the regulations on Contact for just 
one minute?^^ 

The tiny spaceship sat silently, 
while its occupants evidently 
studied the lay of the land. Small 
turrets halfway up its sides twitched 

JEROME BIXBY 




this way and that, pointing popgun 
armament. 

Pud inspected the weapons extra- 
sensorily, and thought an amused 
snort: the things tossed a simple 
hydrogen-helium pellet for a short 
distance. 

Gop, nursing a walloping head- 
ache as a result of Pud’s rough 
counterprobe, thought sourly to 
himself : “I try to save the yim . 
that’s wrong. He forgets to de- 
activate the thig . that’s all right. 
I esprobe . that’s wrong. He 
esprobes . that’s all right.” 

At last: “They’re getting out,” 
Gop observed. 

A tiny airlock had opened in the 
side of the ship. A metal ladder 
poked out, swung down, settled 
against the ground. 

The aliens — two of them — ap- 
peared; looked down, looked up, 
looked to the right and to the left. 
Then they came warily down the 
ladder. 

For a few minutes the giant 
Vegans watched the creatures wan- 
der about. One of them approached 
one of Pud’s tails. Irritatedly Pud 
lifted it out of the way. The little 
creature snooped on, unaware that 
twenty tons of invisible silicoid 
flesh hung over its head. Pud curled 
the tail close to him, and did like- 
wise with all his other tails. 

“You’d better do the same,” he 
advised Gop, his thought-tone peev- 
ish. 

Silently, Gop drew in his tails. 
One unwise move, he knew, and 
the Senior Scientist would start 
thinking in roars. 

One of Gop’s tails scraped slight- 
ly against a huge boulder. The 

LABORATORY 



scales made a tractor-on-gravel 
sound. 

Pud thought in roars. 

The tiny creature had stopped 
and was turning its helmeted head 
this way and that, as if trying to 
see where the sound had come from. 
It had drawn a weapon of some 
sort from a holster at its belt — an- 
other thermonuclear popgun. 

The creature turned and came 
back toward the Vegans, heading 
for his ship. Pud lifted his tail 
again. The creature passed under 
it, reached the ship, joined its 
partner. 

HEARD it too, Johnny,” Helen 
JL Gorman said nervously. “A 
loud scraping noise — ” 

“It seemed to come from right 
behind me,” Johnny Gorman said. 
“Damn near scared me off the 
planet ... I thought it was a 
rockslide. Or the biggest critter in 
creation, sneaking up on me. I 
couldn’t see anything, though . , 
could you?” 

“No.” 

Johnny stood there, blaster in 
hand, looking around, eyes sharp 
behind his faceplate. He saw noth- 
ing but flat, grayish-red ground, a 
scattering of stone outcroppings 
large and small; nothing but the 
star-clouded black of space above 
the near horizon, and the small sun 
of the system riding a low hillock 
like a beacon. 

“Blue light,” he said thoughtfully. 
“Green light. Red and purple 
lights. And a mess of crazy colors 
we never saw before. Whatever 
those flashes were, honey, they 

63 




looked artificial to me . 

Helen frowned. “We were pretty 
far oflF-world when we saw them, 
Johnny. Maybe they were aurorae 
— or reflections from mineral pock- 
ets. Or magnetic phenomena of 
some kind . that could be why 
the ship didn’t handle right during 
landing — ” 

Johnny studied the upside-down 
dials on the protruding chest-board 
of his spacesuit. 

“No neon in the atmosphere,” he 
said. “Darned little argon, or any 
Ollier inert gas. The only large 
mineral deposits within fifty miles 
are straight down. And this clod’s 
about as magnetic as an onion.” He 
gave the surrounding bleak terrain 
another narrow-eyed scrutiny. “I 
suppose it could have been some 
kind of aurora, though . it’s gone 
now, and there isn’t a sign of any- 
thing that could have produced 
such a rumpus.” He looked around 
again, then sighed and finally bol- 
stered his blaster. “Guess I’m the 
worrying type, hon. Nothing alive 
around here.” 

“I wonder what that sound 
was.” 

“Probably a rock falling. This 
area’s been undisturbed for God 
knows how many million years . 
the jolt of our landing just shook 
things up a little.” He grinned, a 
little sheepishly. “As for the land- 
ing ... I was so scared after that 
meteor hit us, it’s a wonder I 
didn’t nail the ship halfway into the 
planet, instead of just jolting us 
up.” 

Helen looked up at the three-foot 
hole in the side of the ship. 

Johnny followed her gaze, and 

64 



grunted. “We’d better get to work.” 
He turned to the ladder that led 
up to the airlock. “I’ll rig the com- 
pressor to charge the spare oxy- 
tanks . we’ll have to delouse this 
air of ammonia, but otherwise it’s 
fine. Look, honey, I won’t need 
any help; why don’t you get busy 
on a PC?” 

Helen nodded, still staring up at 
the meteor-hole. “You know,” she 
said slowly, “it wouldn’t happen 
again this way in a million years, 
Johnny. Thank God, this clod was 
here ... we ought to name it Life- 
saver.” 

“Yeah, sure,” Johnny said ironi- 
cally. “It’ll save our lives. Only 
thing is, it got us into this mess in 
the first place!” 

He started up the ladder, using 
only his arms, legs trailing. 

Helen got down on hands and 
knees and began poking around for 
the two dozen or so samples needed 
for Standard Planetary Classifica- 
tion. Bits of rock, air, vegetable 
growth, dust — the dust was very 
important. All went into vac-con- 
tainers at her belt. 

Then suddenly she said, “O-o-o- 
oo/.'” and reared back on her knees 
and clapped both hands to her 
helmet. Her eyes squeezed shut be- 
hind her faceplate, then opened 
wide and frightened. 

By the time her hands reached 
her helmet, Johnny had his blaster 
out and was floating toward the 
ground, looking around for some- 
thing to shoot at. His boots touched, 
and two long light-gravity steps 
brought him to her side. 

Pud had been leaning over the 
JEROME BIXBY 




tiny spaceship, one of his faces only 
feet above the little creatures. 

Gop’s thought came: “What are 
they?” 

“Fanged if I know. Bipeds . 
never saw such little ones.” Pud 
adjusted several eyes to a certain 
wavelength and studied the crea- 
tures through their spacesuits. He 
gave Gop a thought-nod: “Mam- 
mals. Bi-sexual. They’re probably 
mates.” 

“It’s a miracle they didn’t land 
right in the middle of one of our 
experiments.” 

That brought back Pud’s ill- 
temper. “Miracle! Didn’t you see 
me give this cosmic kiddycar of 
theirs a couple of psychokineticlouts 
so they’d land where they did?” 
The Senior Scientist glared around 
at their thousand-and-one experi- 
ments, and then down at the little 
spaceship, smaller than the smallest 
of them, squatting on toy fins. He 
curled a tentacle, as if wishing he 
could swat it. 

Gop knew, however, that despite 
Pud’s irritation at having his work 
interrupted, he was just a little in- 
trigued by the aliens. No matter 
how insignificant they were they 
were animate life of some intelli- 
gence, and Pud must be wondering 
about them. 

Gop thought it might be a good 
idea to dwell on that, in order to 
keep Pud from getting his heads in 
an uproar again. 

“Can you get into their 
thoughts?” he inquired. 

“I haven’t tried. I don’t think I 
could keep my potential down to 
their level.” 

“Wonder where they’re from.” 
LABORATORY 



“Who cares?” Pud snorted. “I 
just wish they’d go away.” 

Gop noted, though, that Pud’s 
heads were lowering closer over the 
creatures. 

“They’re nowhere near accepta- 
ble Contact level, are they?” Grop 
said, after a moment. 

“From their appearance, I’d say 
they’re even beneath classification. 
Reaction motor in their ship. Primi- 
tive weapons. Protective garments 
. they can’t even adjust physically 
to hostile environments!” 

A minute passed. 

Pud said, “Mm. Well. I think I 
will see what I can read . just to 
have something to talk about at the 
Scientists’ Club.” 

He sent out a tentative probe . • . 
a little one . just enough to regis- 
ter in one of his brains the total con- 
scious content of one of the little 
creature’s minds. He was afraid to 
go deeper, after the subconscious, 
though actually that was far more 
important. But deep probing would 
probably be felt for what it was, 
while conscious probing was just a 
little painful. 

The creature popped erect in its 
squatting position, and clapped its 
upper extremities to its head. 

The other one, which had been 
scrambling up the ladder to the 
ship’s airlock, drew its popgun and 
joined the first. 

“They’re from someplace called 
Earth,” Pud said. “In the V-LM- 
12Xva Sector of this Galaxy, as 
nearly as I can make out. They’re 
an Exploration Team, sent out by 
their planet to gather data on the 
nature of the physical universe.” 
He paused to consult the third 

65 




memory bank of his fifth brain, 
where he had impressed the content 
of the creature’s mind. “They’ve 
had space travel for about two hun- 
dred of their years. I translate that 
as about eleven of ours.” He con- 
sulted again. “Highly materialistic. 
Externally focused. Very limited 
sensorium. An infant race, chasing 
everything that moves, round and 
round through their little three- 
dimensional universe. They’ve a 
long way to go.” 

“What are they doing here?” 
“Hm.” Pud consulted again. “A 
routine exploration flight brought 
them to this system . and an al- 
most unbelievable coincidence has 
served to delay them here. They 
dropped their meteor-screens for 
just a moment — at just the wrong 
moment. A large meteor came 
along, entered the ship, and 
destroyed both their atmosphere- 
manufacturing equipment and the 
large pressure tank of atmosphere 
which they kept as reserve in case 
the equipment should fail.” He 
paused. “Mixture of hydrogen and 
oxygen . they can’t live without 
it. At any rate, the ship was evacu- 
ated, and they barely had time to 
get into the . mm, spacesuits, they 
call them . which they now wear. 
The accident left them with no 
atmosphere whatever, except the 
small amount in the tanks of those 
suits. That will be exhausted in a 
short time ... I gather diat if this 
planet hadn’t been here, they’d 
have been goners. As it stands, they 
plan to charge their spare suit- 
tanks, which weren’t harmed, with 
the air of this planet, and then re- 
turn to their Earth, subsisting on 



the tanked air, by hyperspatial 

drive ” Again Pud paused. “Hm. 

Well, now! I’d overlooked that. So 
they have hyperspatial drive, at 
least . and after only two hun- 
dred years of space travel! Hm. 
Perhaps they are worth a closer 
look ...” 

Pud lowered his heads over the 
two little aliens, who were moving 
warily, popguns drawn, away from 
the ship. 

“Pu4” Gop said nervously. 

“What?” 

“One of them is crawling toward 
the time-warp.” 

“Well, don’t tell me about it . 
lift the warp out of the way!” 

Gop extended a tentacle, first re- 
constituting it on the seventh 
atomic sublevel so he wouldn’t get 
it blown off, and gently picked up 
the time-warp. It looked like a blue- 
violet frozen haze in his grasp. He 
set it down on the other side of the 
spaceship, anchoring it again to 
now so it wouldn’t go flapping off 
along the time-continuum. 

“So they didn't land because they 
saw flashes from our experiments,” 
he said a little triumphantly. 

One of Pud’s heads turned and 
gave the Junior Scientist an acid 
look, while the others continued to 
observe the aliens. 

“They lowered their meteor- 
screens,” he said nastily, “thus 
bringing about this entire bother, 
because they wanted to get a better 
look at the flashes.” 

Gap was silent, but he thought 
acidly: “That’s what you say — you 
won’t let me esprobe, and when 
you do, you manage to prove it’s 
all my fault.”

JEROME BIXBY 




OHNNY GORMAN had just 
said to Helen, “I want to chip 
a few samples off that outcropping 
over there . come on, hon.” 

He started toward the ridge of 
gray-black rock. Helen followed on 
his heels. 

“As-pir-in,” she said, deliberately 
falsetto, and her helmet-valet fed 
her another pill with a sip of water. 

“Then we’ll go back and stick in- 
side the ship until the tanks are 
charged,” Johnny went on, a little 
grimly. “I think we’re just edgy. 
Planets don’t give people headaches 
. and there’s nothing alive with- 
in a million miles of this dustball.” 
He hefted his blaster, which he had 
adjusted to Wide-Field. “But just in 
case . 

“^ud,” Gop said, still more nerv- 
ously. 

“Yes, I see, you idiot! Lift the 
tharn~^e\d out of their way . I’ll 
take care of the space-warp genera- 
tor!” 

The giant Vegans, for all their 
bulk, moved soundlessly and at 
great speed until they were between 
the aliens and the stone outcropping 
toward which they appeared to be 
heading. Gop extended a tentacle, 
curled it at an odd angle, and 
picked up the shimmering tharn- 
field,which was the Vegans’ reser- 
voir of Basic Universal Energy. Set 
in any energy matrix, tharn became 
that energy; added to any existing 
energy, thorn augmented it to any 
desired potential. Thus it was ex- 
tremely valuable to their experi- 
ments . and very risky stuff to 
handle, as well. 

Gingerly, Gop set the thorn down 
LABORATORY 



beyond the outcropping. At Ac 
same time he picked up several in- 
struments that lay nearby — an elec- 
tron-wrench, a snurling-iron, a 
plotz-meter, several pencil-rays. He 
placed them on the ground beside 
the thorn. 

Pud had curled twelve tentacles 
around the space-warp generator — 
it was as big as a city block, and 
heavy, even in light gravity. He 
puffed a thought at Gop: “Give me 
a tentacle.” 

Gop helped his Master place the 
generator safely on the other side 
of the ridge. 

Johnny Gorman banged off a 
handful of rock, and shoved it into 
the vac-container at his belt. 

“Okay, hon,” he said. “Let’s go.” 

They stood one more moment 
atop the ridge, looking out over the 
barren, rusty-gray plain that the 
ridge had until now concealed from 
their gaze. 

“Looks just as dead as the rest,” 
Johnny observed. “I guess we were 
just jumpy over nothing.” He 
turned to start down the slope. 
“Come on.” 

In Aree long light-gravity steps 
he had reached the bottom, and 
turned to steady Helen. 

She wasn’t there. 

She had tripped and tumbled off 
the other side of the ridge. He 
could hear her screaming. 

^^Putrefied proteins!"^ Pud roared. 
“Help me get it out of the thornP* 

The two Vegans leaned over the 
ridge. While Gop forced the writh- 
ing folds of the tharn-fie\d apart 
wiA two reconstituted tentacles, 

67 




Pud reached in, plucked the little 
alien out and set it upright. 

It immediately scrabbled up the 
side of the ridge as fast as it could 
and joined its mate, which had 
bounded up the other side. 

“Now look at what you’ve done!” 
Pud raged. “What about the rules 
on Contact! The Examiners will get 
this out of us when we report on 
our Projects . mountains of bites, 
we’ve revealed ourselves!” 

“Not really, Master,” Gop said, 
rushing his thoughts. “All the crea- 
ture will know is that it tumbled 
into the field, and then was some- 
how ejected by it ... a trick of grav- 
ity, perhaps ... a magnetic vortex 
... it won’t know what really hap- 
pened — 

“That — field — ^was — supposed — 
to — ^be — turned — Pud said, 
every one of his faces green with 
rage. 

ftj j» 

“You are a stupid, clumsy, few- 
headed piece of provender!” 

Gop flushed clear down to his 
tails. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I can’t 
think of everything at once! I must 
have accidentally activated the 
tham when I moved it. I’m sorryF* 

Pud clapped a tentacle to his 
prime forehead. “What next!” he 
moaned. 

“Oh, Johnny, Johnny,” Helen 
sobbed. “I tripped when I started 
to turn around, and fell down the 
other side, and all of a sudden . 
it was horrible ... I thought I was 
going crazy — 

Johnny Gorman had his arms 
tight around her. Behind her back, 
his blaster was pointed straight 

68 



down the far slope of the ridge, 
ready to atomize anything that 
moved. 

“What, honey?” he said. “What 
happened? I didn’t see anything 
near you . what happened?” 

“It was like I was in a hurricane 
. I couldn’t see anything, but 
something seemed to be whirling 
around me, something as big as the 
universe . and it seemed to be 
whirling inside me too! I felt — it 
felt like . Johnny, I was crossed!^* 
“Crossed?” He shook her gently. 
“What do you mean, you were 
crossed?” 

“It felt like my right side was my 
left side, and my heart was beating 
backwards, and my eyes were look- 
ing at each other, and I was just 
twisted all downside up outside and 
inside out upside, and . Johnny,” 
she wailed, “I am going crazy!” 
“Oh, no, you’re not,” he said 
grimly. “You’re going back to the 
ship! I don’t know what gives with 
this creepy clod, but I know we’re 
not moving an inch outside the ship 
until we blast off! Come onV 

“They’re crawling back toward 
their ship. Pud . look out, they’re 
heading for the dimensional-warp!” 
Pud extended a tentacle ninety 
feet and slapped the dimensional- 
warp out of the path of the scurry- 
ing creatures. 

The warp bounced silently on the 
rocky ground, caromed like a fire- 
ball from boulder to boulder, en- 
countered stray radiation from the 
f/iflrn-field that still glowed invisibly 
on the other side of the ridge, and 
became activated; it emitted con- 
centric spheres of nameless-colored 

JEROME BIXBY 




energy, and a vast snapping and 
crackling. 

*'There/" Gop thought trium- 
phantly at Pud. “That’s just what 
I did with the tham-field ... I guess 
nobody is above accidents, eh?” 
Pud thought pure vitamins at his 
Junior Scientist. “You idiot, I didn’t 
accidentally turn on the warp! You 
left the tharn on, and it triggered 
the warp! Why didn*t you deac^ 
tivate the tharn?” 

“Why didn’t you?^^ Gop shot 
back. “You were there too!” 

Pud lashed a tentacle over the 
outcropping, and the ^Aarn*field be- 
came inactive. Then he looked 
around, and every eye in his prime 
head popped. “Look out, the di- 
mensional-warp is spreading . it’s 
lost its cohesion ... oh, digestion^ 
they’re in that now!” 

Johnny and Helen Gorman were 
in a universe of blazing stars and 
nebulae that whirled like cosmic 
carousels; of gas clouds that seethed 
in giant turbulence ... it was the 
universe of creation, or a universe 
in its death-throes . 

Johnny . .” 

^^Helen ...” 

The boiling universe exploded 
away from them in soundless radia- 
tion, in all directions ... in five 
directions, their subconscious minds 
told them ... it vanished into 
nothingness, a nothingness that sur- 
rounded them like white blindness, 
and then suddenly it was restored 
again, roiling, churning, flashing 
with the bright eyes of novae, shot 
with the sinuous streamers of rush- 
ing gas clouds, pulsing with the 
heartbeats of winking variables , • . 

laboratory 



And suddenly they were tumbling 
head over heels along the rocky 
ground of the little planetoid again. 

Johnny . 

^^Helen . 

“At least we got them out of 
that/^ Pud puffed. “The sub-tem- 
poral field, Gop . help me lift it 
. hurry!” 

“Master, all our experiments are 
activated! The tharn radiated 
enough to activate everything!*^ 

*^Help me lift the sub-temporal 
field!** 

“Master, it’s too late . they’re 
in it!” 

A million miles above their heads 
was the vast sweep of All Time, like 
a rushing, glassy, upside-down river 
. they tumbled through a chaos 
where Time, twice in each beat of 
their hearts, bounced back and 
forth between creation and entropy, 
and took them with it . Time was 
a torrent beneath whose surface 
they were yanked back and forth 
from Beyond the End to Before the 
Beginning like guppies on a deepsea 
line; a torrent whose banks were 
dark eternity, and whose waters 
were the slippery substance of 
years. 

Johnny . 

^^Helen . 

Pud deactivated the sub-temporal 
field with a lash of a tentacle, and 
the two little aliens rolled from it; 
like dice from a cup, gasping and 
wailing. Immediately they started 
running again toward their ship, 
dodging between the faint flickers 
of red, blue, green, scarlet and 
nameless-colored light that marked 
the location of those experiments 

69 




which, now activated and releasing 
their fantastic energies, defied even 
the invisibility fields that still sur- 
rounded them. 

The aliens brushed against an- 
other experimental field, and it 
twisted itself in one millionth of a 
second into a fifth-dimensional 
topological monstrosity that would 
take weeks to untangle — ^if it didn’t 
explode first, for it bulged danger- 
ously at the seams. 

Pud hastily back-tentacled the 
field into an interdimensional-vor- 
tex, where, if it did explode, it 
would disrupt an uninhabited uni- 
verse so far down on the scale of 
subspaces that nobody would get 
hurt. 

Then the Senior Scientist 
gathered ten tons of machinery in a 
tentacle and hoisted it while the 
creatures ran beneath. Gop was 
psychokineticarrying five energy- 
fields toward the sidelines, with an- 
other dozen or so wrapped in his 
tentacles. Pud silently dumped his 
load of machinery and reached for 
something else in the creatures’ 
path. 

But the creatures scurried er- 
ratically, stopping, dashing off in 
this direction, skidding to a halt as 
they saw something else to terrify 
them, and then dashing off in that 
direction just as the Vegans had 
dealt with an obstacle to their 
progress in this direction. 

“Pud! . one of them fell 
through the intraspatial-doorway to 
the other side of the planet!” 

“Well, for the love of swallowing, 
reach through and get it! If those 
beasts see it, they’ll tear it to 
pieces!” 

70 



H elen GORMAN faced some- 
thing that was a cross between 
a tomcat and an eggplant on stilts. 
It looked hungry. It bounded to- 
ward her in forty foot lopes. 

“Johnny . Johnny, where are 
you , . 

Helen fainted. 

Several other garage-sized beasts 
converged on her, all looking as 
hungry as the first. In reality, they 
weren’t hungry — their food con- 
sisted of stone, primarily, while 
they also drew sustenance from 
cosmic radiation. But they liked to 
tear things to pieces. They were na- 
tive to the planetoid; the Vegan 
Scientists had gathered them up 
and shoved them through the intra- 
spatial-doorway to this side of the 
planet, where they wouldn’t be im- 
derfoot all the time. It was a one- 
way doorway, through which Pud 
or Gop would occasionally reach to 
pluck one of the beasts back for 
use in experimentation. 

Now, just as the beasts reached 
Helen Gorman, one of Gop’s ten- 
tacles came through the doorway, 
followed by one of his smaller heads. 
The Junior Scientist picked up 
Helen, and hastily extruded another 
tentacle from the first to bat aside 
one of the beasts that leaped after 
her. 

The part of the tentacle bearing 
Helen Gorman swished back 
through the doorway. The head 
and die rest of the tentacle fol- 
lowed. 

The beasts commenced fighting 
among themselves, which was what 
they did most of the time anyway. 

Gk)p, however, in his haste, had 
forgotten to repolarize the mole- 

JEROME BIXBY 




cules of his body while retreating 
through the doorway . and the 
moment he cleared the doorway on 
the other side of the planet, the 
doorway reversed — still one-way, 
but now the other way. 

And eventually one of the beasts, 
attracted by all the flickering and 
flashing and frantic scrabbling visi- 
ble through the doorway, aban- 
doned the fun of the fight and 
leaped, like a ten-ton gopher, 
through the opening. 

The others followed, naturally. 
They always chased and tore apart 
the first one to cut and run. 

Gop had just set Helen Gorman 
on the ground, and Johnny Gor- 
man, seeing her apparently materi- 
alize from thin air and float down- 
ward, had just started to stagger 
toward her, when the ten-ton 
gopher began to vivisect one of 
Pud’s tails. The animal hadn’t seen 
the tail, of course — it was invisible. 
But it had stumbled over it, and 
been intrigued. 

Pud leaped ninety feet into the 
air, roaring. Roaring out loud, not 
thought-roaring. And roaring with 
a dozen gigantic throats. The sound 
thundered and rolled and crashed 
and echoed from the low hills 
around. 

The beast fell off Pud’s tail, 
bounced, looked around, and made 
for Johnny Gorman as the only 
visible moving object. 

Johnny’s eyes were still bugging 
from the gargantuan roar he had 
just heard. He saw the beast and 
dodged frantically, just as Gop’s 
invisible tentacle shot out to bowl 
the beast over. 



In dodging, Johnny tumbled into 
another energy-field. 

... He stood on his own face, 
saw before his eyes the hairy mole 
on the back of his neck, and threw a 
gray-and-red insideout hand before 
his eyes in complete terror. Then 
Pud nudged him gently out of the 
field, and before Johnny’s eyes, in 
an instantaneous and unfathomable 
convolution, the hand became nor- 
mal again. 

About that time the rest of the 
beasts emerged from the intra- 
spatial-doorway. While some of 
them continued the fight that had 
begun on the other side of the 
planet, others started for Johnny 
Gorman and for Helen, who was 
now sitting up weakly and shaking 
her head. 

A beast resembling a steam-shovel 
on spider’s legs rammed full-tilt 
into a force-field. The field bounced 
fifty feet and merged with another 
field in silent but cataclysmic em- 
brace, producing a sub-field which 
converted one tenth of one percent 
of all water within a hundred foot 
radius to alcohol. 

The effect on Johnny and Helen 
was instantaneous . they became 
drunk as hoot-owls. Their eyes 
bleared and refused to focus. Their 
jaws sagged. Johnny stumbled, and 
sat down hard. He and Helen 
stared dolefully at each other 
through their faceplates. 

Pud gave up every last hope of 
avoiding Contact. 

He picked up Johnny with one 
tentacle and Helen with another 
and set them down on top of their 
spaceship, where there was just 

71 



LABORATORY 




enough reasonably flat surface on 
the ship’s snub nose to hold them. 

The beasts were chasing one an- 
other around and around through 
the wreckage of the laboratory. 
They romped and trampled over 
delicate machines, sent heavier 
equipment spinning to smash 
against boulders; they ran head-on 
into sizzling energy-fields and, head- 
off, kept running. 

Pud grabbed up an armful of 
beasts, raced to the doorway, re- 
versed it and poured them through. 
He grabbed up more beasts, threw 
them after. Gop was busily engaged 
in the same task. Some of the beasts 
began fighting among themselves 
even as the Vegans held them — 
Crop jumped as one tore six cubic 
yards of flesh from a tentacle. He 
healed the tentacle immediately, 
then hardened it and all his other 
tentacles to the consistency of pig 
iron. He held back that particular 
beast from the lot. When the others 
had been tossed through, he hauled 
back his tentacle, wound up, and 
pegged the offending beast with all 
his might. It streaked through the 
doorway like a projectile, legs and 
eyestalks rigid. 

Pud plucked a machine from the 
two-foot claws of the very last 
beast, and tossed the beast through. 
Then he examined the machine — ^it 
was beyond repair. He slammed 
that through the doorway too. 

In ten seconds, the two Vegan 
Scientists had slapped and mauled 
all their rioting experiments into 
inaction. 

Silence descended over the battle- 
ground. Silence, more nerve-shat- 
tering than the noise had been. 

72 



P UD LOOKED around at the 
remains of the laboratory, every 
face forest-green with rage. 

Machines lay broken, tilted, 
flickering, whining, wheezing, like 
the bodies of the wounded. Delicate 
instruments were smashed to bits. 
The involuted field that Pud had 
flung through the vortex had evi- 
dently burst, as he had feared — ^for 
the vortex had vanished. So, prob- 
ably, had the universe the field had 
burst in. The two fields that had 
interlocked were ruined, each hav- 
ing contaminated the other beyond 
use. Other energy-fields, having ab- 
sorbed an excess of energy from the 
tharn, were bloated monstrosities 
or bumed-out husks. 

It would take weeks to get the 
place straightened up . even 
longer to replace the smashed 
equipment and restore the ruined 
fields. 

Many experiments in which time 
had been a factor would take 
months — and in some cases years — 
to duplicate. 

All that was bad enough. 

But worst of all . the little 
aliens had been Contacted. 

Like it or not, the aliens knew 
that something was very much up 
on this planetoid. 

Like it or not, they’d report that, 
and more of their kind would come 
scurrying back to investigate. 

Pud groaned, and studied the 
little creatures, who sat huddled to- 
gether on the nose of the ship. 

“Well,” he thought sourly to 
Gop, “here we are.” 

“I — ^yes. Master.” 

“Do you think that from now on 
you’ll watch the Detector?” 

JEROME BIXBY 




“Oh, yes, Master — I will.” 

“And do you think it matters a 
Chew now if you do or not? Now 
that we’ve revealed ourselves?” 
“I— I—” 

“We have a choice,” Pud said 
acidly. “We can destroy these little 
aliens, so they can’t report what 
they’ve seen. That’s out, of course. 
Or we can move our laboratory to 
another system ... a formidable 
job, and Food knows whether we’d 
ever find another planet so suited 
to our needs. And even if we did do 
that, and they found nothing when 
they returned here, they’d still 
know we were around somewhere.” 
“They wouldn’t know that weWe 
around, Master.” 

“They’d know something is 
around . don’t mince words with 
me, you idiot. You know that 
they’ve seen enough to draw the 
very conclusions we don’t want 
them to draw. You know how vital 
it is that no race under Contact- 
level status know of the existence 
of other intelligent races . par- 
ticularly races far in advance of it. 
Such knowledge can alter the entire 
course of their development.” 
“Yes, Master.” 

“So what are we to do, eh? Here 
we are. And there — ” Pud motioned 
with a tentacle at the little aliens — 
“they are. As you can see, we must 
reveal ourselves to still a greater 
extent . they can’t even get into 
their ship to leave the planet with- 
out our help!” 

Gop was silent. 

“Also — ” Pud sent a brief extra- 
sensory probe at the aliens, and 
both of them clutched at their hel- 
meted heads — “their problem of air 

LABORATORY 



supply is critical. There is very little 
left in their suit-tanks, and the time 
required for their machines to re- 
fine air from this planet’s atmos- 
phere has been wasted in — in — the 
entertainment so recently con- 
cluded. At this moment they are 
resigned to death. Naturally, we 
must help them.” He paused. “Well, 
my brilliant, capable, young Junior 
Nincompoop? Any ideas on how we 
can help them, and still keep our 
Scientists’ status when the Examin- 
ers get the story of this mess out of 
us?” 

“Yes, Master.” 

“I thought not.” Pud continued 
his frowning scrutiny of the aliens 
for a moment. Then he looked up, 
his faces blank. “Eh? You do?” 

“Yes, Master.” 

“Well, great gobs of gulosity, 
whatr 

“Master, do you recall the time 
experiment that you wanted to try 
a few years ago? Do you recall that 
the idea appealed to you very much, 
but that you wanted an intelligent 
subject for it, so we could determine 
results by observing rational reac- 
tions?” 

“I recall it, all right. My brave 
young Junior Scientist declined to 
be the subject . though Food 
knows you’re hardly intelligent 
enough to qualify anyway. Yes, I 
remember . but what’s that got 
to do with — ” 

Pud paused. The jaws of his sec- 
ondary heads, which were more 
given to emotion, dropped. Then 
slowly his faces brightened, and his 
many eyes began to glow. 

“Ah,” he thought softly. 

“You see, Master?” 

73 




“I do indeed.” 

“If it works, we’ll have no more 
problem. The Examiners will be 
pleased at our ingenuity. The aliens 
will no longer — ” 

“I see, 1 see .. all right, let’s 
try it!” 

Pud reached down and picked 
one of the aliens off the nose of the 
ship. It slumped in his grasp im- 
mediately. The other alien began 
firing its popgun frantically at the 
seemingly empty air through which 
its mate mysteriously rose. 

The thermonuclear bolts tickled 
Pud’s hide. He sighed and relaxed 
his personal invisibility field and be- 
came visible. That didn’t matter 
now. 

The alien stared upward. Its face 
whitened. It dropped its popgun 
and fell over backward, slid gently 
off the ship’s nose and started a 
slow light-gravity fall toward the 
ground. 

Pud caught it, and said, “I 
thought that might happen. Evi- 
dently they lose consciousness radier 
easily at unaccustomed sights. A 
provincial trait.” 

He slid the aliens gently into the 
airlock of their ship. 

The Vegans waited for the aliens 
to regain consciousness. 

Eventually one did. Immediately, 
it dragged the other back from the 
lock, into the body of the ship. A 
moment later the lock closed. 

“Now hold the ship,” Pud told 
Gop, “while I form the field.” 

Flame flickered from the ship’s 
lower end. It rose a few inches off 
the ground. Gk>p placed a tentacle 
on its nose and forced it down 
again. He waited, while the ship 

74 



throbbed and wobbled beneath the 
tentacle. 

Now, for the first time, Gop him- 
self esprobed the aliens. He sent a 
gentle probe into one of their minds 
— and blinked at the turmoil of ter- 
ror and helplessness he found there. 

Faced with death at the hands 
of “giant monsters,” the aliens pre- 
ferred to take off and “die cleanly” 
in space from asphyxiation, or even 
by a mutual self-destruction pact 
that would provide less discomfort. 

Gop withdrew his probe, wonder- 
ing that any intelligent creature 
could become sufficiently panicky to 
overlook the fact that if the “mon- 
sters” had wanted to kill them, they 
would be a dozen times dead al- 
ready. 

Pud had shaped a time-field of 
the type necessary to do the job. It 
was a pale-green haze in his ten- 
tacles. 

He released die field and, under 
his direction, it leaped to surround 
the spaceship, clinging to it like a 
soft cloak. As the Vegans watched, 
it seemed to melt into the metal and 
become a part of it — the whole ship 
glowed a soft, luminescent green. 

“Let it go,” Pud said. 

Gop removed his tentacle. 

The ship rose on its flicker of 
flame — rose past the Vegans’ 
enormous legs and tails, past their 
gigantic be-tentacled bodies, past 
their many necks and faces, rose 
over their heads. 

Gop sneezed as the flame brushed 
a face. 

And Pud began shaping a psy- 
chokinetic bolt in his prime brain. 
For this purpose he marshaled the 
resources of all his other brains as 



JEROME BIXBY 




well, and every head except his 
prime one assumed an idiot stare. 

He said, “Now!” and loosed the 
bolt as a tight-beam, aimed at the 
ship and invested with ninety-two 
separate and carefully calculated 
phase-motions. 

The ship froze, fifty miles over 
their heads. The flicker from its 
rocket tubes became a steady, mo- 
tionless glow. 

Pud said, “Now,” again, and al- 
tered a number of the phase-mo- 
tions once, twice, three times, in an 
intricate pattern. 

The ship vanished. 

As one, the many heads of the 
Vegan Scientists turned to stare at 
the point in the sky where they had 
first sighted the ship. 

There it was, coasting past the 
laboratory-planet, tubes lifeless; 
coasting on the velocity that had 
brought it from the last star it had 
visited. 

There it was, just as it had been 
before the tiny aliens had sighted 
the flickerings that had caused them 
to relax their meteor-screens. 

There it was, sent back in time 
to before all the day’s frantic hap- 
penings had happened. 

Pud and Gop esprobed the dis- 
tant aliens . and then looked at 
each other in complete satisfaction. 

“Fine!” Pud said. “They don’t 
remember a thing . not a single 
alimentary thing!” He looked 
around them, at the shambles of 
the laboratory. “It’s a pity the ex- 
periment couldn’t repair all this as 
well ... is everything turned off?” 

“Evervthing, Master.” 

“No experiments operating, you 

LABORATORY 



nincompoop? No flashes?” 

“None, Master.” 

“Then they should have no rea- 
son to land, you idiot. 

“You know,” Pud said, “in a way 
it was rather a fortunate thing that 
they landed. It enabled me to per- 
form a very interesting experiment. 
We have demonstrated that a crea- 
ture returned through time along 
the third ^ud-subcontinuum will 
not retain memory of the process, 
or of what transpired between a 
particular point in time and one’s 
circular return to it. I’m glad you 
stimulated me to think of it. Best 
idea I ever had.” 

Pud turned his attention to the 
ruins of the laboratory. He moved 
off, half his heads agonizing over 
the destruction caused by today’s 
encounter, the other half glowing at 
its satisfactory conclusion. 

Gop sighed, and esprobed the 
little aliens for the last time ... a 
final check, to make certain that 
they remembered nothing. 

‘‘Johnny, how about that little 
planet down there ... to the left?^^ 
“Lefs drop the meteor-screens 
for a better look.** 

Hastily, Gop reached out and 
tapped the meteor aside. 

“Heck, that planet looks lifce a 
dud, all right . but it*s two days 
to the next one . and I*ve got a 
terrific headache!** 

“Funny . l*ve got one too.** 
“Well, what say we land and 
stretch our — ** 

By that time Gop had hastily 
withdrawn his headache-causing 
probe. He stared anxiously upward. 

After a moment, he said, 
“They’re landing. Master.” • • •

The execution violated the banc laws of Tharnar. But 



the danger was too great — The Terrans couldn’t be 



permitted to live under any circumstances . 



THE BARBARIANS 



BY TOM GODWIN 



T AL-KARANTH, Supreme Ex- 
ecutive of Tharnar, signed the 
paper and dropped it in to the out- 
going slot of the message dispatch 
tube. It was an act Qiat would 
terminate one hundred and eighty 
days of studying the tapes and rec- 
ords on the Terran ship and would 
set the final hearing of the Terran 
man and woman for that day. 

And, since the Terrans were 
guilty, their execution would take 
place before the sun rose again on 
Tharnar. 

He went to the wide windows 
which had automatically opened 



with the coming of the day’s 
warmth and looked out across the 
City. The City had a name, to be 
found in the books and tapes of 
history, but for fifty thousand years 
it had been known as the City. It 
was the city of all cities, the center 
and soul of Tharnarian civilization. 
It was a city of architectural beau- 
ty, of flowered gardens and land- 
scaped parks, a city of five hundred 
centuries of learning, a city of 
eternal peace. 

The gentle summer breeze 
brought the sweet scent of the flow- 
ering lana trees through the window 



76 





Illustrated by Paul Orhan 



and the familiar sound of the City 
as it went about its day’s routine; 
a sound soft and unhurried, like a 
slow whisper. Peace for fifty thou- 
sand years; peace and the unhur- 
ried quiet. It would always be so 
for the City. The Supreme Execu- 
tives of the past had been chosen 
for their ability to insure the safety 
of the City and so had he. 

He turned away from the window 
and back to his desk, to brush his 
hand across the gleaming metal top 
of it. No faintest scratch marred 
the eternalloy surface, although the 
desk had been there for more than 



thirty thousand years. It was perma- 
nent and never-changing, like the 
robot-operated fleet that guarded 
Tharnar, like the white and mas- 
sive Executive Building, like the 
way of life on Tharnar. 

The Terrans would have to die, 
lest the peace and the way of life on 
Tharnar be destroyed. They were 
of a young race; a race so young 
that his desk had already been in 
place for fifteen thousand years 
wheil they began emerging from 
their caves. They were a dangerous- 
ly immature race; it had been only 
three hundred years since their last 



77 




war with themselves. Three hun- 
dred years — three normal Thar- 
anian lifetimes. And the Tharanians 
had not know war for six hundred 
lifetimes. 

A race so yoimg could not pos- 
sess a civilized culture. The Ter- 
rans were — ^he searched for a suit- 
able description — barbarians in 
spaceships. They lacked the refine- 
ment and wisdom of the Thamar- 
ians; they were a dangerous and 
unpredictable race. It could be seen 
in their history; could be seen in the 
way the two Terrans had reacted 
to their capture. 

He pressed one of the many but- 
tons along the edge of his desk and 
a three-dimensional projection ap- 
peared; the scene that had taken 
place one hundred and eighty days 
before when the Terrans were 
brought to Thamar. 

The ship of the Terrans stood 
bright silver in the sunlight, slim 
and graceful against the bulk of the 
Executive Building behind it. The 
Terrans descended the boarding 
ramp, the left wrist of the man 
chained to the right wrist of the girl. 
Two armed robots walked behind 
them, their faces metallically impas- 
sive, and four armed Thamarian 
guards waited at the bottom of the 
ramp to help take the Terrans to 
their place of imprisonment. 

The Terrans approached the 
guards with a watchfulness that re- 
minded him of the old films of the 
coast wolves that had once lived on 
Vendal. They did not walk with the 
studied, practiced, leisure of the 
Thamarians but as though they 
held some unknown vitality barely 
in check. The face of the man was 



lean and hard, the black eyes in- 
scrutable as flint. The girl looked 
at the guards with a bold non- 
chalance, as though they were really 
not formidable at all. Somehow, by 
contrast with the Terrans, the 
guards appeared to be not grimly 
vigilant but only colorless. 

There seemed to be a menace in 
the way the man watched the 
guards; there was the impression 
that he would overpower them and 
sieze their weapons if given a shad- 
ow of a chance. And the girl — ^what 
would she do, then? Would she 
flash in beside him to help him, as 
the female coast wolves always 
helped their mates? 

He switched off the projection, 
feeling a little repugnance at the 
thought of executing the Terrans. 
They were living, sentient beings, 
and intelligent, for all their lack of 
civilization. It would have been bet- 
ter if they had been of some repul- 
sive and alien physical form, such as 
bloated, many-legged giant insects. 
But they were not at all repulsive; 
they were exactly like the 
Thanarians. 

Exactly? 

He shook his head. Not exactly. 
The similarity was only to the eye — 
and not even to the eye when one 
looked closely, as he had looked at 
the images. There was a potential 
violence about them, lurking close 
beneath their deceptively Thar- 
narian physical appearance. The 
Teirans were not like the Thar- 
narians. There was a difference of 
fifty thousand years between them; 
the difference between savage bar- 
barianism and a great and peaceful 
civilization.

He looked again across the City, 
listening to its softly murmuring 
voice. In hundreds of centuries the 
City had known no strife or vio- 
lence. But what if the barbarians 
should come, not two of them, but 
thousands? What would they do? 

He was sure he knew what they 
would do to the gentle, peaceful 
City and the faint twinge of re- 
morse at the thought of executing 
the Terran man and girl paled into 
insignificance. 

Under no circumstance could 
they be permitted to live and tell 
the others of Tharnar and the City. 



B ob RANDALL shifted his posi- 
tion a little in the wide seat and 
the chain that linked his wrist 
with Virginia’s rattled metallically; 
sounding unduly loud in the quiet 
of the room. 

Virginia’s black hair brushed his 
cheek as she turned her face up to 
him, to ask in a whisper so low it 
could not be heard by the four 
guards who stood beside and behind 
them: 

“It’s almost over, isn’t it?” 

He nodded and she turned her 
attention back to the five judges 
seated at the row of five desks be- 
fore them. The gray-haired one at 
the center desk. Bob knew, was the 
one in charge of the proceedings 
and his name was Vor-Dergal. He 
had gained the knowledge by 
watching and listening and it was 
the only information he had ac- 
quired. He did not know the names 
of the otjier four judges, nor even 
for sure that they were judges and 
that it was a trial. There had been 



no introductions by the Thar- 
narians, no volunteering of informa- 
tion. 

Vor-Dergal spoke to them : 

“In brief, the facts are these: 
You claim that your mission was of 
a scientific nature, that the two of 
you were sent from Earth to try to 
reach the center of the galaxy where 
you hoped to find data concerning 
the creation of the galaxy. Your 
ship carried only the two of you and 
is one of several such ships sent out 
on such missions. Since the voyages 
of these small exploration ships 
were expected to require an in- 
definite number of years and since 
the occupants would have to endure 
each other’s company for those 
years, your government thought it 
more feasable to let the crew of 
each ship consist of a man and a 
woman, rather than two men.” 

He saw Virginia’s cheek quiver at 
the words, but she managed to re- 
strain the smile. 

“Our system was reached in your 
journey,” Vor-Dergal continued, 
“and you swung aside to investigate 
our sister planet, Vendal. You were 
met by a guard ship before reaching 
Vendal and it fired upon you. In- 
stead of turning back, you destroyed 
it with a tight-beam adaptation of 
your meteor disintegrator.” 

Vor-Dergal waited questioningly 
and Bob said : 

“Our instruments showed us that 
the guard ship was robot-operated. 
They could discern nothing organic 
in the ship, nothing alive. The same 
instruments showed us that this 
planet, Vendal, possessed operating 
mines and factories and no organic 
life other than small animals. We 



THE BARBARIANS 



79 




knew that machines neither volun- 
tarily build factories nor reproduce 
other machines, yet the mines 
and factories were operating. We 
thought it might be a world where 
the inhabitants had all died for 
some reason and the robots were 
still following the production orders 
given them when the race lived.” 

“And so you wilfully destroyed 
the guard ship that would have 
turned you back?” 

“We did. It was a machine, 
operated by machines. And so far 
as we knew, it was protecting a 
race that had died a thousand 
years before. It was all a mystery 
and we wanted to find the answer 
to it.” 

Vor-Dergal and the others ac- 
cepted the explanation without 
change of expression. Vor-Dergal 
resumed : 

“Three more guard ships ap- 
peared when you were near Vendal. 
In the battle that followed, you 
severely damaged one of them. And 
when your ship was finally caught 
in the guard cruiser’s tractor beams, 
you resisted the robots. When they 
boarded your ship, you destroyed 
several of them and were subdued 
only when the compartments of 
your ship were flooded with a dis- 
abling gas.” 

“That’s true,” Bob said. 

“In summary: You deliberately 
invaded Thamarian territory, de- 
liberately damaged and destroyed 
Thamarian ships, and would have 
landed on Vendal had the guard 
ships not prevented it. 

“Your guilt is both evident and 
admitted. Are there any extenuating 
circumstances that have not been 

80 



presented at this hearing?” 

“No,” Bob said. 

None had been presented all day 
for the good reason that there was 
not a single factor of the circum- 
stances that the Thamarians would 
consider extenuating. 

“Your guilt was evident from the 
beginning,” Vor-Dergal said. “We 
have spent the past one hundred 
and eighty days in studying the 
books and tapes in your ship. What 
we learned of your history and your 
form of civilization leaves us no 
alternative in the sentence we must 
pass upon you.” 

The chain clinked faintly as Vir- 
ginia lifted her hand to lay it on 
his arm and she gave him a quick 
glance that said, "'Here it comes!^^ 

Vor-Dergal pronounced sentence 
upon them : 

“Tomorrow morning, at thirty- 
three twelve time, you will both be 
put to death by a robot firing 
squad.” 

Virginia’s breath stopped for a 
moment and her hand gripped his 
arm with sudden pressure but she 
gave no other indication of emotion 
and her eyes did not waver from 
Vor-Dergal’s face. 

Vor-Dergal looked past her to the 
guards. “Return them to their cell.” 

The guards produced another 
chain, to link their free arms to- 
gether behind their backs, and they 
were marched across the room and 
out the door. 

Outside, the sun was setting, al- 
ready invisible behind a low-lying 
cloud. Bob calculated the desig- 
nated time of their execution in re- 
lation to the Terran time as given 
by his watch and found that thirty- 

TOM GODWIN 




three twelve would be about half- 
way between daylight and sunrise. 

Tal-Karanth stood by the open 
windows and watched the guards 
return the Terrans to their cell. 
Extra guards, both robot and Thar- 
narian, had been posted inside and 
outside the prison building for the 
night to prevent any possibility of 
an escape. Other robots stood guard 
around the Terran ship, although it 
was inconceivable that the Terrans 
could ever overpower the prison 
guards and reach their ship. 

But it had been inconceivable 
that a ship as small as the Terran 
ship could ever destroy a Thamar- 
ian guard cruiser. The tight-beam 
adaptation circuit of the meteor 
disintegrators was very ingenious. 

Why had the Thamarian cruisers 
not had the same weapon? They 
possessed the same general type of 
meteor disintegrators; the same 
adaptation circuit would transform 
a Thamarian cruiser’s meteor dis- 
integrators into terrible weapons. 
Why had no one ever thought of 
doing such a thing? Why had it 
been taken for granted for fifty 
thousand years that the cmiser’s 
blasters were the ultimate in weap- 
ons? 

What other weapons did the 
Terrans on Earth possess? How in- 
vincible would their cruisers be if 
a small exploration ship could 
destroy a Thamarian cruiser? 

The captive Terrans could not 
be permitted to return to Earth and 
tell the others of Thamar. Neither 
could they be permitted to live out 
their lives in prison on Thamar. 
Someday, somehow, they might es- 

THE BARBARIANS 



cape and return to Earth, or send a 
message to Earth. The robot fleet 
of Thamar could never withstand 
an attack by a Terran fleet; the 
fate of Thamar and the quiet and 
gentle City would be written in 
blood and dust and ashes. 

There was the sound of rubber- 
padded metal feet in the distance 
and he saw six more robots march- 
ing out to add their numbers to the 
robots already guarding the Terran 
ship. The ship, itself, was not far 
from the Executive Building; close 
enough that his eyes, still sharp 
despite his seventy years, could 
make out the name on it: The Cat, 
The Cat, And a cat was — ^he re- 
called the definition to be foimd 
among the Terran books — any of 
various species of carnivorous and 
predatory animals, noted for their 
stealth and quickness, and their 
ferocity when angered, 

T he robot shoved the plastic 
food tray under the cell door 
and went back down the corridor. 
Virginia turned away from the sin- 
gle window, where The Cat could 
be seen as a silhouette merging into 
the darkness. 

“Last supper. Bob,” she said. 
“Let’s eat, drink, and be merry.” 
He went to the door to get the 
tray and noticed the three robots 
and two Thamarian guards down 
the left hand stretch of corridor and 
the same number down the right. 
Virginia came up beside and said, 
“They’re not taking any chances 
we won’t be here in the morning, 
are they?” 

“No,” he said, picking up the 

81 




tray. “None to speak of.*’ 

He carried the tray to the little 
table in the center of the room and 
Virginia seated herself across from 
him as she had done each meal for 
the past six months. But she toyed 
with the plastic spoon and did not 
begin to eat at once. ^ 

“I wonder why they made it a 
firing squad?** she asked. “You’d 
think they would have used some- 
thing ultra-civilized and refined, 
such as some painless and flower- 
scented gas.” 

“Spies were executed with firing 
squads during the last Terran war, 
three hundred years ago,” he said. 
He smiled thinly. “I suppose they 
consider us spies and want us to feel 
at home in the morning.” 

“I’m glad they do. I don’t want 
it to be shut up in a room — I would 
rather be out under the open sky.” 
She poked at the rim of her tray 
again. “They never did tell us why. 
Bob. They didn’t tell us anything, 
only that they had no alternative. 
We didn’t hurt any Tharnarians; 
we only destroyed one of their ships 
and some of their robots.” 

“We upset their sense of security 
and showed them they’re not secure 
at all. I suppose they’re afraid of an 
attack from Earth.” 

“They didn’t tell us anything,” 
she said again. “They act as though 
we were animals.” 

“No ” he said, “they don’t seem 
to have a very high opinion of our 
low position on the social evolution 
scale.” 

He began to eat in the manner 
of one who knows the body needs 
nourishment to take advantage of 
any opportunity for escape, even 

82 



though the mind may be darkly 
certain that no such opportunity 
shall arise. 

“You ought to cat a little, Gin- 
ny,” he said. 

She tried, and gave up after a 
few bites. 

“I guess I’m just not hungry — not 
now,” she said. She glanced at the 
darkened window where The Cat 
had become invisible. “How long 
until daylight again, Bob?” 

He looked at his watch. “Seven 
hours.” 

“Seven hours?” A touch of wist- 
fulness came into her voice. “I 
never noticed, before, how short 
the nights arc.” 

The robot laid the material Tal- 
Karanth had requested on his desk, 
the records and tapes from the Ter- 
ran ship, and withdrew. Tal- 
Karanth sighed wearily as he in- 
serted the first tape in the projector, 
wondering again why he felt the 
vague dissatisfaction and wondering 
why he hoped to find an answer 
among the material from the Ter- 
ran ship. It would be an all night 
task — and he could hardly expect to 
find more than he already knew. 
Tharnar was not safe and secure 
from discovery by Terrans in the 
years to come and faith in the 
robot fleet had been an illusion. 

Before setting the projector in 
operation he put through a call to 
his daughter. 

Thralna’s image appeared before 
him, reclining on a couch while two 
robots worked at caring for her 
finger nails. She raised up a little as 
his image appeared before her and 
the robots stepped back. 

TOM GODWIN 




“Yes, Father?” she asked. 

She waited for him to speak, her 
wide gray eyes on his image and her 
jet-black curls framing her young 
and delicately beautiful face. For 
a moment she reminded him of 
someone ; someone more mature 
and stronger — 

With something of a shock he 
realized it was the Terran girl his 
daughter reminded him of ; that the 
Terran girl seemed the more ma- 
ture of the two although Tharlna 
was twenty-eight and the Terran 
girl was twenty-one. They had the 
same gray eyes and black curls, the 
same curve to the jaw, the same 
chin and full lips . 

But the similarity was only inci- 
dental. There was a grace and a 
gentleness to Thralna’s beauty; a 
grace and gentleness that was the 
result of Mty thousand years of 
civilization. Beneath the superficial 
beauty of the barbarian girl lay 
only an animal-like vitality and 
potential violence . 

“Yes, Father?” Tharlna asked 
again in her carefully modulated 
voice. 

“Are you going to the theatre 
tonight, Thralna?” 

“Yes. Tonight’s play was written 
by D’ret-Thon and it’s supposed to 
be almost as good as one of the 
classics. Why do you ask. Father?” 
“I called to tell you that I have 
to work late tonight. I may not be 
home until morning.” 

“Couldn’t you let a robot do it?” 
“No. I have to do it, myself.” 
“Does it have to do with those 
two aliens?” 

“Yes.” 

A little frown of worry appeared 
THE BARBARIANS 



and as quickly disappeared. Her 
slim fingers touched her forehead 
for a moment, to smooth away any 
vestige of a wrinkle, then she said, 
‘Tt will be such a relief when 
they’re finally disposed of. When- 
ever I think of how they might es- 
cape and get into the City, it 
frightens me. Are you sure they 
can’t escape. Father?” 

“There is no possibility of their 
escaping,” he said. “You go ahead 
with your plans for the evening. 
Will you come home when the show 
is over?” 

“Not for a while. Kin is taking 
me dancing, afterward.” 

“Where you went last time — the 
place where they were reviving the 
old dances?” 

“No. Nobody goes there anymore. 
Those old dances were rather fun 
but they were so — so tiring. Our 
modern dances are much slower 
and more graceful, you know.” 

“All right, Thralna,” he said in 
dismissal. “Enjoy yourself.” 

“Yes, Father.” ^ 

She was reclining on the couch 
again, her eyes closed, when he 
switched off the image. He sat for 
a little while before turning on the 
tape projector, recalling his con- 
versation with her and a feeling 
growing within him that he was al- 
most on the verge of discovering 
still another menace to Thamar. 

\%ginia held her hands to her 
face to shade her eyes as she looked 
out the window. “What you can 
see of the city from here is all bright 
with lights,” she said, “but there’s 
no one on the streets. Only some 
robots. Everyone in the city must 

83 




be in bed.” 

“That’s the way it’s been every 
night,” he said. “Early to bed and 
late to rise — they’re an odd race. 
I’ve wondered what they do to pass 
away the time. But what they’re do- 
ing now is something you should be 
doing — resting.” 

She turned away from the win- 
dow. “I’m not sleepy. I keep think- 
ing of The Cat out there waiting 
for us and how we might get to it 
if we could only get hold of a 
blaster.” 

“Which we can’t try to do until 
they come for us in the morning. 
Some rest now might mean a lot 
then.” 

“All right, Bob.” She went to him 
and sat beside him on his cot. 
“What is it now — how much more 
time?” 

“About three hours.” 

She leaned her head against him 
and he put his arm around her. “I 
guess I am a little tired,” she said. 
“But don’t let me go to sleep.” 

“All right, Ginny.” 

“It’s only three hours and never 
any more, if we aren’t lucky in the 
morning. And if we aren’t lucky, I 
don’t want to have wasted our last 
three hours.” 



AL-KARANTH stood before 
the window again and watched 
the City as it slept in the pre-dawn 
darkness. How many slept in the 
City? Once there had been three 
million in the City but each census 
found the population to be less. Five 
years before there had been less 
than a million — two-thirds of the 
City was a beautiful shell that 

84 



housed only the robots that cared 
for it. 

What was wrong? And why had 
it never occurred to him before that 
there was something wrong? 

He went back to his desk, where 
the material from the Terran ship 
littered the eternalloy top of it, and 
sat down again. He was tired, and 
frustrated. A menace faced Thar- 
nar, and no one seemed to realize 
it. The coming of the barbarians 
had awakened him to the fallacy of 
trusting the robot fleet, but there 
was still another danger. And the 
robot fleet would be more helpless 
before the newly discovered danger 
than it would be before the Terran 
ships. 

He pressed a button and music 
filled the room; music that had al- 
ways before been soothing and rest- 
ful to hear. But it sounded flat and 
meaningless compared with the 
throbbing barbarian music he had 
heard that night and he switched it 
off again. 

What was wrong? It was one of 
the latest compositions; one that 
had been acclaimed as almost as 
good as one of the classics. 

Almost as good. Like the play 
Thralna had attended, like the art 
exhibits, the athletic records, the 
scientific discoveries, like everything 
in the City and on Thamar. Almost 
as good — but never quite as good as 
they had been fifty thousand years 
before. 

Was that part of the answer? 

No — not part of the answer. Part 
of the problem, part of the danger 
greater than a barbarian invasion. 
There was no answer that he could 
see. Something had been lost by the 

TOM GODWIN 





Thamarians fifty thousand years 
before and he was neither sure what 
it was nor how to give it back to 
them. 

He pressed the button that would 
connect him with Security Officer 
Ten-Quoth. Of the two problems, it 
was only within his power to han- 
dle the immediate phase of the first 
problem; to make the final author- 
ization of the execution of the Ter- 
rans. 

Bob looked again at the window 
which had lightened to a pale gray 
square. It was already daylight out- 
side; it would not be long until the 
guards came for them. Virginia had 
fallen asleep at last, more tired than 
she had thought, and she still slept 
with her head against his shoulder 
and with his arm around her to 
support her. He straightened his 
legs slowly, not wanting them to 
be numb from lack of circulation 
when the guards came and not 
wanting to awaken Virginia to grim 
reality any sooner than he had to. 

But the slight movement was 
enough. She opened her eyes drow- 
sily, then the sleepiness gave way 
to the hard jolt of remembrance 
and realization. She looked at the 
gray window and asked, “How 
much longer?” 

“Within a few minutes.” 

“I wish you hadn’t let me sleep.” 
“You were tired.” 

“I didn’t want to sleep — I didn’t 
think I would.” Then she changed 
the subject, as though to keep it 
from going into the sentimental. “I 
see the robot never did come back 
for the tray. We’ll be leaving a 
messy room, won’t we? I wonder if 

THE BARBARIANS 



they’ll disinfect it to make sure it’s 
clean when we’re gone? You know” 
— she smiled a little — “fleas and 
things.” 

She lifted her face to kiss him on 
the cheek, then she rose and moved 
to the window. 

“It’s cloudy,” she said. “There’s a 
mist of rain falling and it’s cloudy 
outside. I guess it’s already later 
than we thought.” 

He went over to stand beside her 
and saw that the morning was 
alight with near-sunrise behind the 
gray clouds. 

“It’s out there waiting for us — 
The Caty^ she said. 

He saw it, standing silver-white 
in the gray morning, gleaming in 
the rain and with its slim, dynamic 
lines making it look as though it 
might at any moment hurl itself 
roaring into the sky. 

“It’s a beautiful ship,” she said. 
“I wonder what they will do with it 
when they — ” 

A sound came from the far end 
of the corridor; a snapped com- 
mand in Thamarian. The com- 
mand was followed at once by the 
sound of footsteps approaching 
their cell ; the heavy tread of robots 
and the lighter, softer steps of the 
guards. 

Virginia turned away from the 
window and they faced the cell 
door as they waited. 

“This is it,” she said. 

“Are you afraid, Ginny?” 

“Afraid?” She laughed up at 
him, a laugh that came only a little 
too quickly. “It’s like a play, set a 
long time ago on Earth. Coffee and 
pistols at dawn. Only I don’t think 
they’re bringing us any coffee and 

85 




if we get a pistol^ it will have to be 
one of theirs.” 

“It isn’t over with till the end — 
and maybe we can change the end- 
ing of this play for them.” 

“I’ll be watching you, Bob, so I 
can help you the moment you make 
the try.” 

The Tharnarian guards stopped 
outside the door, their blasters in 
their hands. One of them unlocked 
the door and two robots entered, 
guards locking the big door behind 
the robots the moment they were 
inside. The robots carried no 
blasters, nothing but three lengths 
of chain. 

The Tharnarian leader outside 
the door rasped a command : 

“You will both turn to face the 
window, with your hands behind 
you.” 

Bob did not obey at once, but 
appraised the situation. The robots 
were massive things — more than 
six hundred pounds in weight, their 
metal bodies invulnerable to any 
attack he could make with his bare 
hands. But there was one chance 
in ten thousand: if he could catch 
the first robot by surprise and send 
it toppling into the cell door, its 
weight might be enough to break 
the lock of the door. 

He struck it with his shoulder, all 
his weight and strength behind the 
attack, and Virginia’s small body 
struck it a moment later. 

But it was like shoving against a 
stone wall. The robot rocked for the 
briefest instant, then it threw out a 
foot to regain its balance. The other 
robot snapped a chain around his 
wrists while Virginia fought it. 

“Don’t, Ginny,” he said, ceasing 



his own struggles. “It’s no use, 
honey.” 

She stopped, then, and the robot 
jerked her arms around behind her 
back, to lock the second chain 
around her wrists. 

She smiled up into his dark and 
sombre face. “We tried. Bob. They 
were just too big for us.” 

A third chain, longer than the 
first two, was produced. He felt the 
cool metal of it encircle his neck 
and heard the lock snap shut. The 
other end of it was locked around 
Virginia’s neck. 

The cell door was opened and the 
guard leader commanded, “Step 
forward. The robots will guide 
you.” 

They stepped forward, the robots 
beside them, gripping their arms 
with steel fingers. The chain around 
their necks rattled from the move- 
ment of walking, linking them to- 
gether like a pair of captive wild 
animals. Bob wondered if the chain 
had been solely as another precau- 
tion to prevent their escape or if it 
had been a deliberate act of con- 
tempt. The Tharnarians feared 
them and, because they feared 
them, they hated them. Did it bol- 
ster the morale of the Tharnarians 
to deliberately treat them as though 
they were animals? 

They stepped out into the cool 
dawn, into a small courtyard with a 
black stone wall at its farther side. 
The sky was bleakly gray and the 
rain was falling as a cold mist, 
dampening Virginia’s face as she 
looked up at him. 

“The last mile. Bob.” 

“Walk it straight and steady, 
Ginny. They’re watching.” 

TOM GODWIN

“How else would we walk it?** 
she asked calmly. 

They came to the wall, where a 
metal ring had been set in the stone. 
There was a chain fastened to the 
ring and when the robots had 
swung them around with their 
backs to the wall, the free end of 
the chain was locked to the center 
of the chain around their necks. 

Again, it could be an added pre- 
caution. Or it could be the final 
attempt to let their execution be 
like the killing of a pair of danger- 
ous animals. It did not really mat- 
ter, of course . 

Two of the armed robots who 
had walked with the guards took up 
a position twenty feet in front of 
them, blasters in their metal hands. 
The robots who had chained them 
stepped to one side, away from the 
line of fire. The leader of the guards 
lifted his arm to look at his watch 
and said something to the robots. 
The robots lifted their blasters at 
the words and leveled them, one 
aimed at Virginia’s heart and one 
at Bob’s. 

But the expected blast did not 
come. The guard leader continued 
to observe his watch. Apparently 
the first command had meant only: 
“Aim.” The “Fire” command 
would come when the hands of the 
watch reached the thirty-three 
twelve mark. 

Virginia’s shoulder was warm 
against his arm. But her hand, 
when it found his behind their 
backs, was cold. 

“They cheated us,” she said. “We 
were supposed to have a whole 
firing squad.” 

The guard leader gave another 
THE BARBARIANS 



command and there was a double 
click as the robots pressed the but- 
tons that would ready their blasters 
for firing. Virginia swayed a little 
for the first time, a movement too 
small for the Tharnarians to see 
and one from which she recovered 
almost at once. 

“It’s— I’m all right,” she said. 
“I’m not afraid. Bob.” 

“Of course you’re not, Ginny — of 
course you’re not.” 

The guard leader had returned 
his attention to his watch and the 
seconds went by; long seconds in 
which the only sound was the al- 
most inaudible whisper of the rain 
against the stone wall behind them. 
Virginia looked up at him for the 
last time, the cold mist wet on her 
face. 

“We’ve had a lot of fun together. 
Bob. We never expected it to end 
so soon, but we knew all the time 
that it might. We’ll go together and 
that’s the way we always wanted it 
to be, wherever and whenever it 
might happen.” 

Then she faced forward again 
and they waited, the rain whisper- 
ing on the wall behind them and 
forming in crystal drops on the 
chain around their necks. She did 
not waver again as she stood beside 
him and he knew she would not 
when the end came. 

The guard leader dropped his 
arm, as though he no longer needed 
to refer to his watch. He glanced 
at them very briefly then turned to 
the robots, his face revealing the 
command he was going to give. 

Virginia’s hand tightened on his 
own in farewell and he could feel 
the pulse of her wrist racing hard 

87 




and fast. But she stood very straight 
as she looked into the blaster and 
they heard the final command to 
their robot-executioners : 

*'Dorend thendar^* 



hirty-three one. 

Tal-Karanth looked again at 
the timepiece on the wall. Thirty- 
three one. At the end of eleven 
more small fractions of time, the 
Terrans would no longer exist. 

What was life? What was the 
purpose behind it all? In fifty thou- 
sand years the Tharnarians were 
no nearer the answer than their 
ancestors had been. Why should 
there be life at all? Why not the 
suns and planets, created by chance, 
and devoid of life? And why even 
the suns and planets, the millions 
of galaxies racing outward across 
the illimitable expanse of space and 
time? Why the universe and why 
the life it contained? Why not just 
— nothing? 

The barbarians had set out to 
find the answer within a hundred 
years after the building of their first 
interstellar ship. And Tharnar’s in- 
terstellar ships had not been outside 
the system for fifty thousand years; 
no Tharnarian had been as far as 
Vendal for fifteen thousand years. 

Why had the Tharnarians lost 
their curiosity; the curiosity and 
desire to learn that had created the 
past glory of Tharnar? 

He thought again of what he had 
discovered that night ; of one of the 
reasons why the Terrans had named 
their ship The Cat. It was not be- 
cause a cat was a dangerous animal, 
as he and the others had thought. 

88 



It was because the mission of The 
Cat would be to explore in un- 
known territory, because of an old 
Terran proverb: Curiosity killed a 
cat. He did not yet understand the 
second reason behind the name, but 
the first reason showed that the 
Terrans were not without a sense of 
humor. How long had it been since 
he had heard a Tharnarian laugh at 
himself, at his own failings or possi- 
bility of failure? Never. 

Yet — wasn’t that pride? What 
was wrong with the high-headed 
pride that admitted no inferiority, 
no failure? Wasn’t fifty thousand 
years of civilization something of 
which to be extremely proud? 

Thirty-three five. 

He went to the window and 
pressed the button that would open 
it against the mechanical will of the 
automatic health-guard equipment. 
It slid open and he breathed the 
cool, moist air that smelled of wet 
earth and grass and the odor of the 
lana tree flowers; flowers that were 
closed against the rain and would 
not open until the sun came out. 

The City was quiet in the gray of 
the morning. He could see one 
pedestrian and three moving ve- 
hicles in the entire visible portion 
of the City. The City, like the 
flowers of the lana trees, would not 
open into life until the storm was 
over and the sun was shining again. 

Thirty-three nine. 

The City, like the flowers of the 
lana trees. The beauty and perfec- 
tion of them both was the result of 
fifty thousand years of breeding to 
bring about that perfection. The 
City, like the flowers of the lana 
trees . 




TOM GODWIN 




But flowers were without pur- 
pose; were only — ^vegetation. 

And what was the purpose of the 
City? 

He did not know. He was the 
Supreme Executive of Thamar, 
and he did not know. 

Thirty-three ten. 

He went back to his desk and 
switched on the three-dimensional 
projection of the scene that would 
be taking place in the coiutyard 
behind the prison. 

The man and girl stood chained 
to the wall and the robots were 
waiting for the third and last com- 
mand from the guard leader, the 
blasters in their hands as steady as 
though held in vises and their metal 
faces impassive. He increased the 
magnification of the scene, drawing 
the images of the man and girl 
closer to him. There was no reading 
the man’s face, other than the hard- 
ness and lack of fear. But on the 
face of the girl was a defiance that 
seemed to shine like a radiance 
about her. He was reminded of the 
physical similarity between the bar- 
barian girl and his daughter. But 
now the similarity had faded to a 
shadow. There was something vital 
and alive about the barbarian girl, 
there was a beauty to her in the way 
she waited for death that was 
strange and wild by Thamarian 
standards. 

What had Thralna said the night 
before? “. Whenever I think of 
how they might escape and get into 
the City, it frightens 
— it frightens me — 

What if it was Thralna who stood 
before the robots? Would she have 
her Thamarian pride as she looked 

THE BARBARIANS 



into the black muzzle of the blaster 
and knew she had only a few more 
heart beats of life left? Would she 
stand with the bold defiance of the 
barbarian girl? Or would she drop 
to the ground and plead for her 
life? 

He knew the answer. But it was 
not Thralna’s fault that she was as 
she was. She was only like all the 
others of Thamar. 

Thirty-three eleven. 

How diflFerent they were, the two 
barbarians and the men and women 
of Thamar. Yet the difference 
would cease to exist within a few 
moments. When the man and girl 
were dead, when all the life and 
restless drive were gone from them 
and they lay still on the cold, wet 
ground, they would look the same 
as Thamarians. 

How did it feel to die in the cold 
dawn, on an alien world a thousand 
lightyears from your own? But they 
had known such a thing might hap- 
pen to them. They had named their 
ship The Cat because of that. Be- 
cause of that, and something 
else . 

Suddenly, clearly, he understood 
the second reason for the name of 
their ship. 

Thirty-three twelve. 

The guard leader dropped his 
arm, to give the last command to 
the robots. Tal-Karanth’s mind 
raced and he saw two things with 
vivid clarity: 

He saw the inexorable decline of 
Thamar and the City continuing 
down the centuries until the little 
spark that was left smouldered its 
last and was gone. And he saw the 

89 




way death would obliterate the wild 
and savage beauty of the barbarian 
^rl, knew that it would go when the 
life went from her, to leave her 
with a beauty that would be color- 
less by contrast, that would be like 
the beauty of a lana blossom — or a 
Tharnarian woman. 

And he thought he could see the 
answer to the menace that faced 
Thamar and the City. 

^^Dorend—*^ 

The guard leader’s first word of 
command came. Tal-Karanth’s fin- 
ger stabbed at one of the buttons 
along his desk. He shoved it down, 
to deactivate the robot-execution- 
ers, and they were frozen in immo- 
bility when the final word came: 

^^—thendarr 

He snapped the switch which 
connected him with the office of 
Security Officer Ten-Quoth and 
said: 

“Have the chains taken from the 
Terrans and see that they are given 
comfortable and unguarded quar- 
ters. Tell them they have been par- 
doned by the Supreme Executive 
and that they are free to leave 
Tharnar whenever they wish.” 



I T WAS mid-moming of the next 
day, bright and warm with a few 
fleecy white clouds drifting across 
the blue sky. Tal-Karanth stood 
before the window again, Vor- 
Dergal beside him, and watched the 
City come to life ; slowly and leisure- 
ly, as it had come to life each mid- 
moming for the past fifty thousand 
years. 

Vor-Dergal looked toward The 
Cat, where the boarding ramps had 

90 



already been withdrawn and the 
airlocks closed. 

“They’re ready to go,” he said. 
“I hope you haven’t made a mistake 
in what you did. The other Terrans 
will learn of us now, and when they 
come . .” He let the sentence trail 
off, unfinished. 

“We have a great deal to gain by 
the coming of the Terrans,” Tal- 
Karanth said, “and little to lose.” 

“Little to lose?” Vor-Dergal 
asked. “We have Thamar and the 
City to lose; we have our lives and 
our civilization to lose.” 

“Yes, our civilization,” Tal- 
Karanth said. “Our god that we 
worshipped — our civilization. Look, 
Vor — listen to what I have to say: 

“I did some thinking the night 
the Terrans were waiting to be 
executed. I’m afraid it was probably 
one of the few times for thousands 
of years that a Tharnarian ever 
tried to critically examine the Thar- 
narian way of life. I started from 
the beginning, more than fifty thou- 
sand years ago, when the interstellar 
ships of Tharnar were actually in- 
terstellar and were manned by men 
instead of robots. 

“It was a good start we made in 
interstellar exploration, but it didn’t 
last very long. We wanted to asso- 
ciate with our cultural peers, and 
there weren’t any. We didn’t at- 
tempt to make any contact with the 
primitive races we found. We felt 
that there would be no point in do- 
ing so. Thamar possessed the high- 
est — and the only — civilization in 
all the explored regions of the 
galaxy and younger races had noth- 
ing to offer us. 

“The time came when no more 
TOM GODWIN 




exploration ships were sent out. We 
retired to Thamar and Vendal and 
surrounded them with a robot- 
operated fleet, to keep out the in- 
ferior races when they finally did 
learn how to build spaceships. We 
devoted ourselves to our social cul- 
ture and became imbued with self- 
satisfaction, with the assurance that 
we of Thamar possessed the full 
flowering of culture and progress. 
We withdrew into a shell of com- 
placency and each generation lived 
out its life with comfortable, 
methodical, sameness. And our 
robot-operated fleet was on guard 
to prevent any other race from 
annoying us, from disturbing us 
in the wisdom and serenity of our 
way of life. 

“Fifteen thousand years ago, the 
last of us on Vendal returned to the 
more ideal world of Thamar. And 
there was plenty of room for them 
on Thamar by then. The popula- 
tion had been decreasing for thou- 
sands of years — it’s decreasing right 
now. Women don’t want to have 
children anymore — it’s an incon- 
venience for them. They want com- 
fort; the full stomach, the soft 
couch, the attention of their robots. 
And men are the same. 

“There is no longer any incentive 
for living on Thamar other than to 
duplicate the lives of our ancestors. 
There is nothing new, nothing to be 
done that has not already been done 
better. So we lapse into an existence 
of placid satisfaction with the status 
quo — ^we vegetate. We’re like plants 
that have been seeded in the same 
field for so many centuries that the 
fertility of the soil is exhausted. This 
barren field in which we grow is our 

THE BARBARIANS 



own form of culture. 

“Do you sec what the ultimate 
end will have to be, Vor?” 

He had thought old Vor-Dergal 
would reply with a heated defense 
of Thamarian civilization, but he 
did not. Instead, he said, “If the 
present trend continues, there will 
come a time when there will be 
more robots in the guard ships than 
there will be Thamarians for them 
to guard. But is the other better, the 
destruction at the hands of the bar- 
barians?” 

“Destmction? It’s within their 
power to destroy us, but why should 
they? It will be unpleasant for many 
Thamarians to contemplate, but an 
unbiased study of the Terrans shows 
that they would not want the things 
we have on Thamar and in the 
City; that they would not consider 
Thamar and the City worth the 
trouble of conquest.” 

“A conjecture,” Vor-Dergal said. 
“And, even if you are right and the 
Terrans never come to destroy us — 
what have we to gain by taking this 
risk?” 

“New life. We’ve been too long 
in the barren field of our own cul- 
ture. We’ve lost our curiosity, our 
desire to learn, our sense of humor 
that would permit us to make 
honest self-evaluations, our pride 
and courage. And in losing these 
thinp, we lost our racial urge to 
survive. 

“Look at the City this morning, 
Vor. See how slowly it moves ; listen 
to how still it is for a city that con- 
tains almost a million people. Do 
you know what this day is for the 
City? It’s one more act, to be added 
to all the thousands of acts in the 



91 




past, in the City’s rehearsal for ex- 
tinction. 

“The Tcrrans have what we lost. 
They’re a young race with a vitality 
that’s like a fire where our own is 
like a dying spark. That’s why I let 
those two go; why I want the others 
of their kind to know of Thamar 
and come here. It’s not too late for 
us ; not yet too late for contact with 
these Terrans to give back to us all 
these things we lost.” 

In the pause following his words 
the quiet of the City was suddenly 
shattered by the thunder of The 
Cat's drives. It lifted, shining and 
slender and graceful, and hurled it- 
self up into the blue sky. Tal- 
Karanth watched it until it was a 
bright star, far away and going out 
into the universe beyond, until the 
sound of its drives had faded and 
gone. 

He looked away from the sky and 
back to the slowly moving, softly 
whispering City; the City that was 
dying and did not know it. He felt 
the stirring of an uneasiness within 
him; a strange non-physical desire 
for something. It was the first time 
in his life he had ever felt such a 
sensation; it was something so long 
gone from the Tharnarians that the 
Tharnarian word for it was obso- 
lete and forgotten. But the Terran 
word for it was wanderlust. 

“I almost wish I could have gone 
with them, Vor,” he said. “They’re 
going to try to reach the heart of 



the galaxy and see if they can find 
the answer to Creation. And we on 
Thamar spend our lives sipping 
sweet drinks as we discuss trifles 
and wait for the sun to shine warm 
enough for us to emerge from our 
air-conditioned houses.” 

“If you’re right in thinking that 
Terrans won’t come to plunder 
Thamar and the City,” Vor-Dergal 
said, “then it would be interesting 
to know what those two find when 
they reach the center of the galaxy. 
If they don’t get killed long before 
they reach it.” 

“I think any hostile forms of life 
they encounter will find them hard 
to kill,” Tal-Karanth said. “We 
paid a high price for their capture, 
remember? There were two Terran 
proverbs behind the name of their 
ship. It took me quite a while to 
understand the second one but 
when I did, I realized the true ex- 
tent of Terran determination and 
self-confidence. 

“Their mission was to explore 
across the unknown regions of 
space. They knew it would be dan- 
gerous, very dangerous. So they 
named their ship ‘The Cat' partly 
because of an old Terran proverb: 
‘Curiosity killed a cat.' But that was 
only half the reason behind the 
name. They intended to reach the 
center of the galaxy and they didn’t 
intend to let anything stop them. So 
there was a second meaning behind 
the naming of their ship: 

“ ‘A cat has nine lives,' ” • • •

and prejudice. — Hendrik Willem V an Loon

people regarded spacemen — 
and Reston fully appreciated 
the irony .

PLANET 



BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 



The European Project was a 
noble undertaking. It was the re- 
sult of the efforts of a group of 
noble men who were acquainted 
with the tragic histories of coun- 
tries like Czechoslovakia, Lithu- 
ania, Rumania, and Poland — coun- 
tries whose juxtaposition to an ag- 
gressive totalitarian nation had 
robbed them of the right to evolve 
naturally. The European Project

returned that right to them by giv- 
ing them the stars, A distant planet 
was set aside for each downtrodden 
nation^ and spaceships blasted off 
for New Czechoslovakia^ New Lith- 
uania^ New Rumania^ and New Pol- 
land, bearing land-hungry, God- 
fearing peasants. And this time the 
immigrants found still waters and 
green pastures awaiting them in- 
stead of the methane-ridden coal 
mines which their countrymen had 
found centuries ago in another 
promised land. 

There was only one mishap, in 
the entire operation: the spaceship 
carrying the colonists for New Po- 
land never reached its designated 
destination . 

—RETROSPECT; Vol. 16, The 
Earth Years (Galactic History 
Files) 

T he snow was failing softlv 
and through it Reston could 
see the yellow squares of light that 
were the windows of the commun- 
ity hall. He could hear the piano 
accordian picking up the strains of 
Moja Dziewczyna Myje Nogi,^^ 
“My Girl is Washing Her Feet,” 
he thought, unconsciously revert- 
ing to his half -forgotten native 
tongue ; washing them here on 
Now a Polska the way she washed 
them long ago on Earth, 

There was warmth in the 
thought, and Reston turned con- 
tentedly away from his study win- 
dow and walked across the little 
room to the simple pleasures of 
his chair and his pipe. Soon, he 
knew, one of the children would 
come running across the snow and 
knock on his door, bearing the 

94 



choicest viands of the wedding 
feast — kielbasa perhaps, and gol- 
abki and pierogi and kiszki. And 
after that, much later in the even- 
ing, the groom himself would come 
round with the wodka, his bride 
at his side, and he and Reston 
would have a drink together in the 
warm room, the snow white and 
all-encompassing without, perhaps 
still falling, and if not still falling, 
the stars bright and pulsing in the 
Nowa Polska sky. 

It was a good life, hard some- 
times, but unfailing in its finer mo- 
ments. In his old age Reston had 
everything he wanted, and above 
all he had the simple things which 
are all any man wants in the final 
analysis; and if he occasionally 
needed to apply a slightly different 
connotation to a familiar word or 
two in order to alleviate a recur- 
rent sadness, he harmed no one, 
and he did himself much good. At 
sixty, he was a contented if not a 
happy man. 

But contentment had not come 
to him overnight. It was a product 
of the years, an indirect result of 
his acceptance of a way of life 
which circumstance and society had 
forced upon him . 

Abruptly he got up from his 
chair and walked over to the win- 
dow again. There was a quality 
about the moment that he did not 
want to lose: the reassuring yellow 
squares of the community hall win- 
dows were part of it, the lilting ca- 
dence of the piano accordion; the 
softly falling snow — 

It had been snowing on that 
night forty years ago too, when 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




Reston had landed the emigration 
ship; not snowing softly, but with 
cold fury, the flakes hard and 
sharp, and coming in on a strong 
north wind ; biting and stinging 
the faces of the little group of im- 
migrants huddled in the lee of the 
slowly disintegrating ship, biting 
and stinging Reston’s face too, 
though he had hardly noticed. He 
had been too busy to notice — 

Busy rounding up the rest of his 
passengers, then hurrying the 
women out of the danger area and 
setting the men to work unloading 
the supplies and equipment from 
the hold, using signs and gestures 
instead of words because he could 
not speak their language. As soon 
as the hold was empty, he directed 
the rearing of a temporary shelter 
behind the protective shoulder of 
a hill; then he climbed to the top 
of the hill and stood there in the 
bitter wind and the insanely swirl- 
ing snow, watching his ship die, 
wondering what it was going to 
be like to spend the rest of his 
life in a foreign colony that con- 
sisted entirely of young, newly mar- 
ried couples. 

For a moment his bitterness over- 
whelmed him. Why should his ship 
have been the one to develop re- 
actor trouble in mid-run? Why 
should the appalling burden of 
finding a suitable planet for a 
group of people he had never seen 
before have fallen upon his shoul- 
ders? He felt like shaking his fist 
at God, but he didn’t. It would 
have been a theatrical gesture, de- 
void of any true meaning. For it 
is impossible to execrate God with- 
out first having accepted Him, and 

PROMISED PLANET 



in all his wild young life the only 
deity that Reston had ever wor- 
shiped was the Faster-Than-Light- 
Drive that made skipping stones of 
stars. 

Presently he turned away and 
walked back down the hill. He 
found an empty comer in the make- 
shift shelter and he spread his 
blankets for the first lonely night 

In the morning there were im- 
provised services for the single 
casualty of the forced landing. 
Then, on leaden feet, the immi- 
grants began their new life. 

Hard work kept Reston occupied 
that first winter. The original vil- 
lage had been transported from 
Earth, and it was assembled in a 
small mountain-encompassed val- 
ley. A river running through the 
valley solved the water problem for 
the time being, though chopping 
through its ice was a dreaded 
morning chore; and an adjacent 
forest aflforded plenty of wood to 
burn till more suitable fuel could 
be obtained, though cutting it into 
cords and dragging the cords into 
the village on crude sleds was a 
task that none of the men looked 
forward to. There was a mild flu 
epidemic along tow^ards spring, but 
thanks to the efficiency of the 
youthful doctor, who of course 
had been included as part of the 
basic structure of the new society, 
everybody pulled through nicely. 

After the spring rains the first 
crops were planted. The soil of 
Nowa Polska turned out to be a 
rich dark loam, a gratifying cir- 
cumstance to Reston, who had bled 
his ship of its last drop of energy 

95 




in order to find the planet. Jt was 
already inhabited, of course — 
traces of the nomadic pilgrimages 
of the indigenes were apparent in 
several parts of the valley. At first 
Reston had some hope in that di- 
rection — until several of the natives 
walked into the village one morn- 
ing, smiling hugely with their mul- 
tiple mouths and pirouetting gro- 
tesquely on their multiple legs. 

But at least they were friendly, 
and, as it later developed, conven- 
ient to have around. 

He helped with the planting that 
first spring. That was when he be- 
came aware that he was even less 
an integral part of the new culture 
than he had thought. Many times 
he found himself working alone 
while the immigrants worked in 
groups of twos and threes. He 
could not help thinking that he was 
being avoided. And several times 
he caught his fellow-workers look- 
ing at him with unmistakable dis- 
approval in their eyes. On such oc- 
casions he shrugged his shoulders. 
They could disapprove of him all 
they wanted to, but like him or 
not, they were stuck with him. 

He loafed the summer away, 
fishing and hunting in the idyllic 
foothills of the mountains, sleeping 
in the open sometimes, under the 
stars. Often he lay half the sum- 
mer night through, thinking' — 
thinking of many things: of the 
sweet taste of Earth air after a 
run, of scintillating Earth cities 
spread out like gigantic pinball ma- 
chines just waiting to be played, 
of bright lights and lithe legs, and 
chilled wine being poured into tall 
iridescent glasses; but most of all 

96 



thinking of his neighbors’ wives . , 

In the fall he helped with the 
harvest. The indigenes’ pen hant 
for farm work was still an un- 
known factor and consequently had 
not yet been exploited. Again he 
saw disapproval in the immigrants’ 
eyes. He could not understand it. If 
he knew the peasant mind at all, 
these people should have approved 
of his willingness to work, not dis- 
approve of it. But again he 
shrugged his shoulders. They 
could go to hell as far as he was 
concerned, the whole self-righteous, 
God-fearing lot of them. 

It was a bountiful harvest. To 
the immigrants, accustomed as they 
were to the scrawny yields of Old 
Country soil, it was unbelievable. 
Reston heard them talking enthus- 
iastically about the fine kapusti, 
the enormous ziemniaki, the gol- 
den pszenica. He could understand 
most of what they said by then, 
and he could even make himself 
understood, though the thick cz*s 
and sz^s still bothered him. 

But the language was the least of 
his troubles in the winter that fol- 
lowed. 

After the way the immigrants 
had acted toward him in the fields, 
Reston had anticipated a winter 
of enforced isolation. But it was not 
so. There was scarcely an evening 
when he wasn’t invited to the An- 
druliewicz’s or the Pyzykiewicz’s or 
the Sadowski’s to share a flavorful 
meal and to join in the discussion 
of whatever subject happened to 
be of most concern to the com- 
munity at the moment— the fodder 
for the newly domesticated live- 
stock, the shortcomings of the vil- 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




lage’s only generator, the proposed 
site for the church . Yet all the 
while he ate and talked with them 
he was conscious of an undercur- 
rent of uneasiness, of an unnatural 
formality of speech. It was as 
though they could not relax in his 
presence, could not be themselves. 

Gradually, as the winter pro- 
gressed, he stayed home more and 
more often, brooding in his wife- 
less kitchen and retiring early to 
his wifeless bed, tossing restlessly in 
the lonely darkness while the wind 
gamboled round the house and sent 
the snow spraying against the eaves. 

I N A WAY, the babies had been 
the hardest thing of all to take. 
They began arriving late that sec- 
ond winter. By spring there was a 
whole crop of them . 

There was one shining hope in 
Reston’s mind, and that hope alone 
kept his loneliness from turning 
into bitterness — the hope that his 
SOS had been intercepted and 
that a rescue ship was already 
beamed on the co-ordinates he had 
scattered to the stars during the 
taut moments that had preceded 
planetfall. In a way it was a 
desperate hope, for if his S O S 
had not been intercepted it would 
be at least ninety years before the 
co-ordinates reached the nearest 
inhabited planet, and ninety years, 
even when you were twenty-one 
and believed that with half a 
chance you could live forever, was 
an unpleasant reality to contend 
with. 

As the long somber days dragged 
on, Reston began to read. There 

PROMISED PLANET 



was utterly nothing else for him 
to do. He had finally reached a 
point where he could no longer 
stand to visit the burgeoning young 
families and listen to the lusty 
squalling of youthful lungs; or en- 
dure another pitiful baptism, with 
the father stumbling through the 
ritual, embarrassed, humble, a 
little frightened, splashing water 
with clumsy hands on the new in- 
fant’s wizened face. 

All of the available books were 
in Polish of course, and most of 
them, as is invariably the case with 
peasant literature, dealt with relig- 
ious themes. A good eighty per- 
cent of them were identical copies 
of the Polish Bible itself, and 
finally annoyed by its omnipresence 
whenever he asked his neighbors 
for something to read, Reston bor- 
rowed a copy and browsed his 
way through it. He could read 
Polish easily by them, and he could 
speak it fluently, with far more 
clarity and with far more expres- 
sion than the immigrants could 
themselves. 

He found the Old Testament 
God naive. Genesis amused him, 
and once, to alleviate a dull eve- 
ning — and to prove to himself that 
he was still contemptuous of re- 
ligious credos regardless of his sit- 
uation — he rewrote it the way he 
thought the ancient Hebrews might 
have conceived of it had they 
possessed a more mature compre- 
hension of the universe. At first he 
was rather proud of his new ver- 
sion, but after rereading it several 
times he came to the conclusion 
that except for the postulates that 
God had not created Earth first 

97 




and had created a far greater mul- 
titude of stars than the ancient He- 
brews had given Him credit for, it 
wasn’t particularly original. 

After reading the New Testa- 
ment he felt more at peace than he 
had for a long time. But his peace 
was short-lived. Spring devastated 
it when it came. Meadow flowers 
were hauntingly beautiful that year 
and Reston had never seen bluer 
skies — not even on Earth. When 
the rains were over and gone he 
made daily treks into the foothills, 
taking the Bible with him some- 
times, losing himself in intricate 
green cathedrals, coming some- 
times into sudden sight of the high 
white breasts of the mountains and 
wondering why he didn’t climb 
them, pass over them into another 
land and leave this lonely land 
behind, and all the while knowing, 
deep in his heart, the reason why 
he stayed. 

It wasn’t until early in summer, 
when he was returning from one of 
his treks, that he finally saw Helena 
alone. 

There had been a flu epidemic 
during that second winter too, but 
it had not been quite as mild as 
the first one had been. There had 
been one death. 

Helena Kuprewicz was the first 
Nowa Polska widow. 

In spite of himself, Reston had 
thought about her constantly ever 
since the funeral, and he had won- 
dered frequently about the mores 
of the new culture as they applied 
to the interval of time that had 
to elapse before a bereaved wife 
could look at another man with- 

98 



out becoming a social outcast. 

Helena was still wearing black 
when he came upon her in one of 
the meadows that flanked the vil- 
lage. But she was very fair, and 
black became the milk-whiteness 
of her oval face and matched the 
lustrous darkness of her hair. Hel- 
ena was a beautiful woman, and 
Reston would have looked at her 
twice under any circumstances. 

She was gathering greens. She 
stood up when she saw him ap- 
proaching. ^^Jak sie masz. Pan Res- 
ton,” she said shyly. 

Her formality disconcerted him, 
though it shouldn’t have. None of 
the immigrants had ever addressed 
him by his first name. He smiled at 
her. He tried to smile warmly, but 
he knew’ his smile was cold. It had 
been so long since he had smiled 
at a pretty girl . ‘"Jak sie macie^ 
Pani Kuprewicz—” 

They discussed the weather first, 
and then the crops, and after that 
there didn’t seem to be anything 
left to discuss, and Reston accom- 
panied her back to the village. He 
lingered by her doorstep, reluctant 
to leave. “Helena,” he said sud- 
denly, “I would like to see you 
again.” 

“Why of course. Pan Reston. 
You are more than welcome to my 
house . All spring I waited for 
you to come, but when you did not 
I knew” that it was because you 
were not yet prepared, that you 
were not quite certain of the 
call . .” 

He looked at her puzzledly. He 
had never asked a Polish girl for 
a date before, but he was reason- 
ably sure that they didn’t usually 

ROBERT F. rOUNG 




respond in quite so formal a man- 
ner, or in quite so respectful a 
tone of voice. “I mean,” he ex- 
plained, “that I would like to see 
you again because — ”he floun- 
dered for words — “because I like 
you, because you are beautiful, be- 
cause — His voice trailed away 
when he saw the expression that 
had come into her face. 

Then he stared uncomprehend- 
ingly as she turned away and ran 
into the house. The door slammed 
and he stood there for a long time, 
looking dumbly at the mute panels 
and the little curtained windows. 

The enormity of the social crime 
he had apparently committed be- 
wildered him. Surely no society — 
not even a society as pious and as 
God-fearing as the one he was in- 
volved in — ^would expect its widows 
to remain widows forever. But 
even granting that such were the 
case, the expression that had come 
into Helena’s face was still inex- 
plicable. Reston could have un- 
derstood surprise, or even shock — 

But not horror. 

He was something besides just 
an odd number in the peasants’ 
eyes. He was a grotesque misfit, a 
monster. But why? 

He walked home slowly, tiydng to 
think, trying, for the first time, to 
see himself as the immigrants saw 
him. He passed the church, heard 
the sporadic hammering of the car- 
penters as they applied the finish- 
ing touches to the interior. He 
wondered suddenly why they had 
built it next door to the only 
heathen in the village. 

He brewed coffee in his kitchen 
and sat down by the window. He 

PROMISED PLANET 



could see the foothills, green and 
lazily rising, with the mountains 
chaste and white beyond them. 

He dropped his eyes from the 
mountains and stared down at his 
hands. They were long slender 
hands, sensitive from long associ- 
ation with the control consoles of 
half a hundred complex ships; the 
hands of a pilot, different, cer- 
tainly, from the hands of a peasant, 
just as he was different, but bas- 
ically, intrinsically the same. 

How did they see him? 

The answer was easy: they saw 
him as a pilot. But why should 
their seeing him as a pilot so affect 
their attitude towards him that 
they could never relax in his pres- 
ence, could never evince towards 
him the warmth and camaraderie, 
or even the resentment, which they 
evinced towards each other? A 
pilot, after all, was nothing but a 
human being. It was no credit to 
Reston that he had delivered them 
from persecution, no credit to him 
that Nowa Polska had become a 
reality — 

Suddenly he remembered The 
Book of Exodus. He got up, dis- 
believingly, and located the copy 
of the Bible he had borrowed dur- 
ing the winter. With mounting hor- 
ror, he began to read — 



H e had crouched wearily on 
the little ledge. Above him the 
insurmountable comice had obfus- 
cated the sky. 

He had looked down into the 
valley and he had seen the remote 
winking of tiny lights that symbol- 
ized his destiny. But they symbol- 

99 




ized something more than just his 
destiny: they symbolized warmth 
and a security of sorts; they symbol- 
ized all there was of humanity on 
Now a Polska, Crouching there on 
the ledge, in the mountain cold, he 
had come to the inevitable realiza- 
tion that no man can live alone, 
and that his own need for the im- 
migrants was as great as their need 
for him. 

He had begun the descent then, 
slowly, because of his weariness and 
because his hands were bloodied 
and bruised from the frenzy of the 
climb. It was morning when he 
reached the meadows and the sun 
was gleaming brightly on the cross 
above the church. 

Abruptly Reston left the window 
and returned to his chair. There 
was pain even in remembered con- 
flict. 

But the room was warm and 
pleasant, and his chair deep and 
comfortable, and gradually the 
pain left him. Very soon now, he 
knew, one of the children would 
come running across the snow 
bearing viands from the feast, and 
a knock would sound at his door, 
and there would come another one 
of the moments for which he lived, 
which, added together through the 
years, had made his surrender to 
his destiny more bearable. 

His surrender had not immedi- 
ately followed his return to the vil- 
lage. It had come about subtly 
with the passage of the years. It 
had been the natural result of cer- 
tain incidents and crises, of unan- 
ticipated moments. He tried to re- 
member the moment when he had 



first stepped briefly into the niche 
which circumstance and society 
preordained for him. Surely it must 
have been during the fourth winter 
when the little Andruliewicz girl 
had died — 

It had been a dull wintry day, 
the sky somber, the frozen earth 
unsoftened as yet with snow. Res- 
ton had followed the little proces- 
sion up the hill that had been set 
aside for the cemetery and he had 
stood with the gray-faced immi- 
grants at the edge of the little 
grave. The casket was a crude 
wooden one, and the father stood 
over it awkwardly with the Bible 
in his hands, stumbling through the 
service, trying to say the words 
clearly and instead uttering them 
brokenly in his clumsy peasant’s 
voice. Finally Reston could stand it 
no longer and he walked over the 
frozen ground to where the stricken 
man was standing and took the 
Bible into his own hands. Then he 
stood up straight against the bleak 
cold sky, tall and strong, and his 
voice was as clear as a cold wind, 
yet as strangely soft as a midsum- 
mer’s day, and filled with the 
promise of springs yet to come, and 
the sure calm knowledge that all 
winters must pass — 

'T am the Resurrection and the 
Life, saith the Lord: he that be- 
lieveth in me, though he were 
dead, yet shall he live: and whoso- 
ever liveth and believeth in me 
shall never die — 

The knock finally sounded and 
Reston got up from his chair and 
walked over to the door. Funny the

Kids of the future may be pedal- 
ing around in the sky and stopping 
oflf in the “wild blue yonder” to 
look at the earth below whenever 
they like. A new balloon-helicopter, 
recently granted a patent, will be 
the vehicle. Designed for rescue 
and observation work, the aircraft 
combines the slow movement and 
safety advantages of both the 
balloon and the helicopter. It might 
also prove useful to the commuter, 
sports fan and Sunday sight-seer. 
To operate the craft, the pilot sits 
on the seat and pedals with his feet, 
which in turn, causes the helicopter 
blades mounted below the pilot 
to rotate. Once airborne, the pilot 
can literally stop along the way by 
rotating the balloon mounted a- 
bove in the opposite direction of 
the propeller blades. This causes 
the “flying machine” powered by 
human energy to stand still. 

Employers of tomorrow may give 
those they hire a test to show 
which persons should use their 
brains and which should use their 
backs for manual labor. The tests 
will consist of careful examinations 
of the spine, including X-ray pic- 
tures, and in fact, doctors are ad- 



vising them for teen-agers right 
now so that they can be apprised 
early of suitable occupations where 
they will not be putting too much 
strain on backs that can’t take it. 
In recent pre-employment tests of 
6,000 persons, only 39% had what 
could be called normal backs. The 
rest had congenital abnormalities, 
spinal arthritis, postural defects 
and other spinal conditions which 
made them easy prey to low back 
injury or disability. Results of such 
examinations and proper handling 
of personnel accordingly would 
save industry thousands of dollars 
in compensation claims and work- 
ers could be saved time lost, not to 
mention doctor bills for aid to ach- 
ing backs. 

You may never make a million, but 
by the year 2000 the average fam- 
ily income in the United States 
will be $6,600 according to the pre- 
diction made by a Purdue Univers- 
ity professor of sociology. After 
showing that the standard of living 
today is twice as high as it it was 
in 1900, the professor has analyzed 
the probable effects of a continu- 
ation of this trend. First of all, the 
standard will continue to rise. This 
is based on the fact that it has risen 
so very steadily and such a trend 
line rarely changes it course rad- 
ically. The rate of increase may 
lessen, but it will most probably 
continue. Poverty will be reduced. 
Health will improve. A larger mar- 
ket for mass-produced goods will 
be created. More money from each 
family budget will go for luxuries. 
The already declining appeal of 
socialism will dwindle away to 



101 




nearly nothing under such circum- 
stances, predicated on the fact that 
the socialist vote in America has 
decreased as the living standard 
increased. 

Geiger counters may soon be nud- 
ging the hammers, pliers and 
screw-drivers at the local hardware 
store. The Nuclear Measurements 
Corp. has just completed a full 
line of portable counters and scin- 
tillators for uranium prospectors 
that will put them within the reach 
of anyone itching to do a little pro- 
specting in his own backyard on 
Sunday afternoon. They will range 
in price from $99.50 to $199.50, 
will have book-type hinged con- 
struction, separate battery shelves, 
rubber shock mounted tubes and 
will be serviced quickly without 
tools. Only 5 seconds will be neces- 
sary to remove or replace the op- 
erating assembly and only 90 sec- 
onds to replace all batteries. 

Concentrated juices in the refriger- 
ator may soon be things of the past. 
A “superconcentrated” grape juice 
and a “superconcentrated” apple 
juice have been developed that can 
be kept on the pantry shelf for at 
least a year without losing flavor or 
becoming spoiled. The fact that 
they can be stored without refrig- 
eration is seen as a point in favor 
of a possible cutting of the cost of 
such juices for tomorrow’s house- 
wife. Product of the U.S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture’s research 
teams, the super juices are made 
by processing fresh juice to “strip” 
it of its flavor essence. It is then 
concentrated and the essence re- 



stored to it. The secret of the super 
juices’ storage capacity is that they 
are packed at 180 degrees Fahren- 
heit and then cooled quickly. In 
this manner they can be stored in 
glass or tin equally well 

Motorists on the thruways and 
freeways of tomorrow may see 
some pretty strange looking trucks. 
Recent tests with 50-mile-an-hour 
winds and scale model trucks in a 
wind tunnel at the University of 
Maryland have demonstrated that 
some pretty radical streamlining is 
in order for truck-trailers. Engi- 
neers found that the gap between 
the cab and the truck alone ac- 
counted for one-quarter of the air 
resistance. First thing on the 
agenda for the truck of the future 
will probably be a sliding panel 
connection between the two units. 
Another 20% of the air resistance 
can be eliminated by “skirting” the 
vehicle, or covering the top half 
of the wheels with an outside sheet 
of metal. The ultimate in this 
streamlining would employ a “bea- 
ver tail” rear design which would 
reduce wind resistance another 
12%; but since that would cut 
down actual storage space, the de- 
signers will have to make up for it 
some other way — ^which could pro- 
duce some weird looking trucks in- 
deed. 

If the six-fingered mutants science 
fiction writers are always predicting 
ever become a reality, plastic sur- 
geons have already come up with 
a technique to solve the problem. 
Recent experiments have proved 
that fingers and toes can be kept in 
“cold storage” imder the skin of 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



102 




the belly for possible use later to 
replace those lost by accident. The 
extra digit can be removed sur- 
gically, and buried under the skin 
of the abdomen; the fingers will 
stay jointed and the nail remain on 
the nail bed. In past experiments 
of this type, the bones were usually 
absorbed. If a child or a grown-up 
has a finger sliced off by accident, 
present day technique hasn’t yet 
been able to find a way to success- 
fully resew it to the stump because 
the burden of recreating blood cir- 
culation is too great. But if the 
finger has been stored in the ab- 
domen it can be transferred grad- 
ually to the stump without ever 
cutting off circulation. 

Geologists may someday be doing 
their digging in the ocean. Profes- 
sor W. M. Ewing of Columbia’s 
Lamont Observatory has suggested 
that drilling a core 2,000 feet into 
the ocean bottom would reveal one 
of the richest “finds” ever made. 
Such a core would be a cross sec- 
tion of all the sedimentary layers 
piled up since water covered most 
of the planet and scientists could 
deduce much about the past his- 
tory of earth. The bottom-most 
layer, some 2,000 feet down might 
settle the controversy over how the 
earth originated. The “time tube” 
would have to be driven into the 
bottom of a deep ocean basin, 
probably some 3,000 fathoms be- 
low the surface of the water. The 
project would cost some $500,000, 
which isn’t much considering the 
rich fund of earth-history which 
would be revealed. Through drill- 
ing a similar core on dry land 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



might seem easier and less expen- 
sive, sediment layers on the ocean 
floor arc much thinner and a 
greater span of geologic time is 
covered in the same distance. 

Survivors of an atomic or a hydro- 
gen bomb attack in the United 
States may have to spend a week 
underground. This new estimate 
was suggested in a recent publi- 
cation Facts About Fallout, issued 
by the Federal Civil Defense Ad- 
mins tration. One of the recom- 
mendations for survival calls for a 
seven-day supply of B-rations, emer- 
gency food and water for storage 
in home shelters. Previous recom- 
mendations had postulated only a 
three-day post-bomb survival pan- 
try. Now, however, they feel that 
a larger bomb would contaminate 
a larger area, and it would take 
a longer time for decontamination 
crews to survey it for the safety 
factor. Seven days is almost a 
maximum estimate, and the time 
might be considerably less. 

TV may someday replace railroad 
detectives and “yard men” in the 
freight yards of the nation’s rolling 
stock. One such device already in 
operation is working night and day 
in the Potomac Yard in Alexan- 
dria, Virginia. There, two ever- 
vigilant cameras in a shed keep 
their lenses peeled for freight trains 
arriving from the south. As the 
train chugs through the shed at 
ten miles an hour, the number and 
initials of each passing car are 
picked up and relayed to a TV 
screen in the record office two 
miles away.

The Happy dlown 

BY ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




This was a century of peace, plethora and perfection. 



and little Steven was a misfit, a nonconformist, who 



hated perfection. He had to learn the hard way . 



S TE\TN RUSSELL was born a 
misfit, a nonconformist, and for 
the first five years of his life he 
made himself and his parents ex- 
tremely unhappy. The twenty-first 
century was perfect, and this inex- 
plicable child did not like perfec- 
tion. 

The first trouble arose over his 
food. His mother did not nurse him, 
since the doctors had proved that 
Baby-Iiac, and the soft rainbow- 
colored plastic containers in which 
it was warmed and offered, were 
both a vast improvement on nature. 
Steven drank the Baby-Lac, but 
though it was hard to credit in so 
young a child, sometimes his face 
wore an expression of pure distaste. 

A little later he rejected the Baby 
Oatsies and Fruitsies and Meatsies, 
and his large half -focused eyes wept 
at the jolly pictures on the jarsies. 
He disliked his plastic dish made 
like a curled-up Jolly Kitten, and 
his spoon with the Happy Clown’s 
head on the handle. He turned his 
face away determinedly and began 
to pine, reducing his mother to tears 

Illustrated by Kelly Freas 



and his father to frightened anger. 

The doctor said cheerily, 
“There’s nothing the matter with 
him. He’ll eat when he gets hungry 
enough,” and Steven did, to a de- 
gree, but not as if he enjoyed it. 

One day when he was nearly a 
year old, his mother carried his 
Kiddie Korner with the Dancing 
Dogsies on the pad into her bed- 
room, put him in it, and began to 
take things out of the bottom 
bureau drawer. They were old 
things, and Harriet Russell was 
ashamed of them. She had said 
more than once to her husband 
Richard, only half joking, “I 
couldn’t give them away, and I’d be 
ashamed for anybody to see them in 
our trash!” They were old silver, 
knives and forks ^nd spoons that 
looked like what they were, un- 
adorned, and a child’s plain silver 
dish and cup, and one small spoon 
with a useful curly handle. They 
had belonged to Harriet’s great- 
grandmother. Once a year Harriet 
took the thin??s out and polished 
them and furtively put them back. 

This year Steven cried, “Ma!” 
stretching out his hands toward the 



105 




silver and uttering a string of deter- 
mined sounds which were perfectly 
clear to his mother. She smiled at 
him lovingly but shook her head. 
“No, Stevie. Mumsie’s precious 
baby doesn’t want those nasty old 
things, no he doesn’t! Play with 
your Happy Clown, sweetheart.” 

Steven’s face got red, and he 
squeezed his eyes shut, opened his 
mouth and howled until his mother 
passed him the dish and cup and 
curly spoon to play with. At meal- 
time he would not be parted from 
them, and Harriet had to put away 
the plastic dish and spoon. There- 
after, for the sake of the container, 
he tolerated the thing contained, 
and thrived and grew fat. 

Steven did not like his Rockabye 
Grib, that joggled him gently and 
sang him songs about the Happy 
Clown all night long; and he 
howled until they turned it off. He 
was a clean boy, and to his mother’s 
amazement trained himself to be 
dry day and night by the age of 
fourteen months, without the aid of 
the Singing Toidey or the Happy 
Clown Alarm ; so she bought him a 
Little Folks Youth Bed, with a 
built-in joggler, and Happy Clowns 
on the corners, and a television set 
in the footboard. It was a smaller 
copy of his parents’ bed, even to the 
Happy Clowns. Steven did not like 
that either, and if his parents per- 
sisted in turning the bed on after 
he had learned to turn it off, he 
climbed out and slept on the floor. 

Harriet said worriedly to her hus- 
band, “I don’t know what could 
be the matter with him. Dickie, he’s 
peculiar!” 

Richard tried to comfort her. 
106 



“Never mind, Harry, he’ll outgrow 
it.” 

Steven did not outgrow it. When 
he became too big for the curly 
spoon and dish and cup he de- 
manded a knife and fork and spoon 
from the bureau drawer and ate 
his meals from the plainest dish 
he could find. He ate them with 
his back stubbornly turned to the 
television set, away from the morn- 
ing cartoons and the noontime Kid- 
dies’ Lunch Club and the evening 
Happy Clown. 

The Happy Clown had been an 
American institution for thirty 
years. He was on television for an 
hour every night at dinner time, 
with puppets and movies and live 
singers and dancers and his own 
inimitable brand of philosophy and 
humor. Everybody loved the Happy 
Clown. He had been several dif- 
ferent actors in thirty years, but his 
makeup never changed: the beam- 
ing face drawn in vivid colors, the 
rotund body that shook when he 
laughed like a bowlful of Jellsies, 
and the chuckling infectious laugh. 
The Happy Clown was always so 
cheerful and folksy and sincere. He 
believed passionately in all the 
products he instructed his viewers 
to buy, and one was entirely cer- 
tain that he used them all himself. 

He gave one much more than ad- 
vertising, though. Some of his 
nightly gems of wisdom (he called 
them nuggets) were really wonder- 
ful ; they made one think. A favorite 
nugget, which people were always 
writing in and asking him to repeat, 
went like this: “We’re all alike in- 
side, folks, and we ought to be all 

ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




alike outside.” The Happy Clown’s 
viewers were not children and 
adults, they were kiddies and folks. 

After the Happy Clown went off 
the air the happy kiddies went to 
bed, to lie for a while looking at 
the Jolly Kitten and the Dancing 
Dogsie, until, lulled by the joggler, 
they went gently to sleep. After that 
came the cowboys and spacemen, 
carryovers for any happy kiddies 
with insomnia. For really meaty 
programs one had to stay up past 
ten. Then the spectaculars began, 
and the quiz shows, and the boxing 
and wrestling. 

Steven did not like the Happy 
Clown or the Jolly Kitten or the 
Dancing Dogsie. Sometimes he be- 
gan to grow interested in the cow- 
boys or spacemen, but when they 
stopped in the middle of an adven- 
ture to talk about how they could 
not possibly rope the steers or shoot 
the asteroids without a good break- 
fast of Gornsies and Choko-Milko, 
which everybody ate, just every- 
body, Steven climbed out of bed 
and slept on the floor. 

Steven did not like the records 
or the talking books, and when he 
went to kiddie-garden he viewed 
the televised lessons with a cold eye. 
For some reason which he could 
not have explained, he wanted to 
learn to read, but they would not 
teach him till he was seven, and so 
he taught himself, from the letters 
on the jarsies. But then there was 
nothing to read except the news- 
papers and the magazines, which 
he puzzled over patiently, getting 
most of the words right after a 
while. The many advertisements 
were easiest ; they used pictures and 

THE HAPPY CLOWN 



the simplest of language. 

His parents thought it was very 
cunning of him to look at the print- 
ing like that, so wisely, as if he could 
read it! He said once to Harriet, “I 
can read it,” but she said, “Oh, 
Stevie, you’re teasing Mumsiel” and 
looked so frightened at this fresh 
peculiarity that the child said grave- 
ly, “Yes, teasing.” He wished he 
had a silent book. He knew there 
were such things, but there were 
none at home. There were few si- 
lent books anywhere. There were 
none in kiddie-garden. 

Steven was not happy in kiddie- 
garden. The enthusiasm the other 
kiddies showed for the lessons ap- 
palled him. The kiddies themselves 
appalled him. They joined so pas- 
sionately in the group play, clutch- 
ing each other with their hot moist 
hands, panting and grinning into 
each others* faces. They were al- 
ways clutching and panting and 
grinning, in large noisy groups, with 
large community smiles. They con- 
fused him; he could not tell them 
apart. Steven retired to a corner 
and turned his back, and when they 
clutched and panted and grinned at 
him he hit them. 

The kiddie-garden monitor had 
to report of him to his unhappy par- 
ents that he was uncooperative and 
anti-social. He would not merge 
with the group, he would not ac- 
quire the proper attitudes for suc- 
cessful community living, he would 
not adjust. Most shocking of all, 
when the lesson about the birdsies 
and becsies was telecast, he not 
only refused to participate in the 
ensuing period of group experi- 
mentation, but lost color and dis-

graced himself by being sick in his 
corner. It was a painful interview. 
At the end of it the monitor rec- 
ommended the clinic. Richard ap- 
preciated her delicacy. The clinic 
would be less expensive than private 
psychiatry, and after all, the man- 
ager of a supermarket was no mil- 
lionaire. 

Harriet said to Richard when 
they were alone, “Dickie, he isn’t 
outgrowing it, he’s getting worse! 
What are we going to do?” It was 
a special tragedy, since Harriet was 
unable to have any more kiddies, 
and if this one turned out wrong . 

Richard said firmly, “We’ll take 
him to the clinic. They’ll know what 
to do.” 

The first thing they did to Steven 
was to talk to him. The psychiatrist 
made him lie down on a foam rub- 
ber couch, kiddies’ model, with the 
Happy Clown motif on the slip- 
cover, and said with a beaming 
face, “Now, Stevie, what seems to 
be the trouble?” 

The boy turned his head away 
from the psychiatrist’s shining teeth 
and said, “My name’s not Stevie. 
It’s Steven.” He was a thin little 
boy, rather undersized. The baby fat 
had melted away fast when he be- 
gan to be exposed to kiddie-garden. 
He had dark hair and big eyes and 
an uncommonly precise way of 
speaking for a child of five. 

The psychiatrist said, “Oh, but 
we’re going to be friends, Stevie, 
and friends always use nicknames, 
don’t they? My name’s William, but 
everybody calls me Willie. You can 
call me Uncle Willie.” 

The boy said politely, “I’d rather 

108 



not, please.” 

The doctor was undismayed. “I 
want to help you. You believe that, 
don’t you, Stevie?” 

The child said, “Steven. Do I 
have to lie down?” 

The doctor said agreeably, “It’s 
more usual to lie down, but you 
may sit up if you want to. Why 
don’t you like kiddie-garden, Stev- 
en?” 

The boy sat up and regarded him 
warily. The doctor had a kind face, 
a really kind face in spite of all 
those shining teeth, and Steven was 
only five years old, after all, and 
there was nobody to talk to, and he 
was desperately unhappy. Perhaps 
... He said, “You’ll tell them.” 
The doctor shook his head. 
“Nothing goes farther than this 
room, Stevie — Steven.” 

The child leaned forward, press- 
ing his knees together, hugging him- 
self with his arms, bowing his head. 
His position was almost foetal. He 
said, “I’m never by myself. They 
never let me be by myself.” 

The psychiatrist said reasonably, 
“But nobody can live by himself, 
Stevie.” He had apparently forgot- 
ten Steven, and the boy did not 
correct him again. “You have to 
learn to live with other people, to 
work and play with them, to know 
them, and the only way you can 
learn is by being with them. When 
you can’t be with them personally, 
there’s always television. That’s how 
you learn, Stevie. You can’t be by 
yourself.” 

The boy looked up and said 
starkly, “Never?” 

The gleaming teeth showed. “But 
why should you want to?” 

ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




Steven said, don’t know.” 

The doctor said, slowly and with 
emphasis, “Stevie, long before you 
were born the world was a very bad 
place. There were wars all the time. 
Do you kno'v why?” 

The boy shook his head. 

“It was because people were dif- 
ferent from each other, and didn’t 
understand each other, and didn’t 
know each other. They had to learn 
how to be alike, and understand, 
and know, so that they would be 
able to live together. They learned 
in many ways, Stevie. One way was 
by visiting each other — you’ve 
heard about the visitors who come 
from — ” 

Steven said, “You mean the Hap- 
py Tours.” 

“Yes. When you’re twelve years 
old you can go on a Happy Tour. 
Won’t that be fun?” 

Steven said, “If I could go 
alone.” 

The doctor looked at him sharp- 
ly. “But you can’t. Try to under- 
stand, Stevie, you can’t. Now tell 
me— why don’t you like to be with 
other people?” 

Steven said, “All the time— not 
all the time” 

The doctor repeated patiently, 
“Why?” 

Steven looked at the doctor and 
said a very strange thing. “They 
touch me.” He seemed to shrink 
into himself. “Not just with their 
hands.” 

The doctor shook his head sadly. 
“Of course they do, that’s just — 
well, maybe you’re too young to 
understand.” 

The interview went on for quite 
a while, and at the end of it Steven 

THE HAPPY CLOWN 



was given a series of tests which 
took a week. The psychiatrist had 
not told the truth; what the boy 
said, during the first intendew and 
all the tests, was fully recorded on 
concealed machines. The complete 
transcript made a fat dossier in the 
office of the Clinic Director. 

At the end of the tests the Di- 
rector said seriously to Steven’s par- 
ents, “I’ll be frank with you. You 
have a brilliant kiddie here — right 
now he has the intelligence of a 
twelve-year-old- — ^but brilliance has 
to be channeled in the right direc- 
tion. Just now— well, frankly, it’s 
channeled in the wrong direction. 
We’ll give it a year or so, and then 
if things don’t clear up I’m afraid 
we’ll have to correct him.” 

Richard said through dry lips, 
“You mean a Steyner?” 

The Director nodded. “The only 
thing.” 

Harriet shuddered and began to 
cry. “But there’s never been any- 
thing like that in our family! The 
disgrace — oh, Dickie, it would kill 
me!” 

The Director said kindly, 
“There’s no disgrace, Mrs. Russell. 
That’s a mistaken idea many peo- 
ple have. These things happen oc- 
casionally— nobody knows why — 
and there’s absolutely no disgrace 
in a Steyner. Nothing is altered but 
the personality, and afterward you 
have a happy normal kiddie who 
hardly remembers that anything 
was ever wrong with him. Naturally 
nobody ever mentions it . But 
there’s no hurry; in the case of a 
kiddie we can wait a while. Bring 
Stevie in once a week; we’ll try 
therapy first.” 



109 




Being, as the Director had said, 
a brilliant kiddie, Steven soon un- 
derstood much of what was kept 
from him. It did not take him long 
to learn what was making his Dadsie 
look stem and white and what was 
making his Mumsie cry. He loved 
his parents and did not want them 
to be unhappy, and he certainly 
did not want to have his head cut 
open, and so he began to act. Even 
at five, Steven discovered in him- 
self a fine talent for acting. He be- 
gan to conform, to adjust, to merge. 
He became social and cooperative 
and acquired the proper attitudes 
for successful community living. He 
gave up the old silver voluntarily, 
he accepted the Youth Bed, he 
looked at the Happy Clown, and he 
did much better in kiddie-garden. 
He even joined in the group ex- 
perimentation and was not sick any 
more, though he could not keep 
himself from losing color. 

They were pleased with him at 
the clinic and after a few months 
discharged him. By the time Steven 
was twelve and had made the Hap- 
py Tour and joined the Happy 
Scouts and had a happy affair, in- 
volving experimentation, with a 
neighbor’s daughter, Harriet and 
Richard ceased to worry about him. 
If sometimes he felt so tightly 
strung-up that a storm of tears was 
his only relief, he kept the tears 
quiet. 



H e was graduated from high 
school at sixteen and from col- 
lege at twenty, having read all he 
could of the silent books in the 
scant high school library and the 

110 



more ample university one, and 
having wisely elected to appear 
more stupid than he was. Even his 
I. Q. was now judged to be only 
slightly above normal. He left col- 
lege with honors, popularity and a 
reputation as an actor. He took the 
lead in all the dramatic club plays, 
having particular success in the re- 
production of a Happy Clown pro- 
gram. Steven, of course, was the 
Happy Clown. He enrolled at once 
in the New York School of Tele- 
vision Arts, and his mother cried 
when he left home to live in the 
School dormitory. 

Steven did well at Television 
Arts, soon taking more leads than 
was customary in School produc- 
tions, which were organized on a 
strictly repertory basis. He did not 
stay to graduate, being snatched 
away in his first year by a talent 
scout for a popular daytime serial, 
‘The Happy Life.” 

“The Happy Life” recounted the 
trials of a young physician, too 
beautiful for his own good, who be- 
came involved in endless romantic 
complications. Steven was given the 
lead, the preceding actor having 
moved up to a job as understudy 
for the Jolly Kitten, and was an 
immediate success. For one thing 
he looked the part. He was singu- 
larly handsome in a lean dark- 
browed way and did not need flat- 
tering makeup or special camera 
angles. He had a deep vibrant voice 
and perfect timing. He could say, 
“Darling, this is tearing me to 
pieces!” with precisely the right in- 
tonation, and let tears come into 
his magnificent eyes, and make his 
jaw muscles jump appealingly, and 

ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




hold the pose easily for the five min- 
utes between the ten-minute pitch 
for Marquis cigarettes which con- 
stituted one episode of “The Happy 
Life.” His fan mail was prodigious. 

If Steven had moments of be- 
wilderment, of self-loathing, of des- 
pair, when the tears were real and 
the jaw muscles jumped to keep 
the mouth from screaming, no one 
in the Happy Young Men’s dormi- 
tory where he slept ever knew it. 

He managed his life well enough. 
He had a few affairs with girls, it 
was expected of one, and he did not 
have to work very hard at it since 
they always threw themselves at 
him; and he got along well with 
other young men, who forgave him 
for being so handsome because he 
did not work at it except on cam- 
era; but he was lonely. Surrounded 
by people, intruded and trespassed 
upon, continually touched in ways 
other than physical, he was yet 
lonely. 

During his life he had met a few 
other nonconformists, shy, like him, 
wary of revealing themselves, but 
something always seemed to happen 
to them. Some were miserable be- 
ing nonconformists and asked piti- 
fully for the Steyner, some were de- 
tected, as Steven had been, and 
some were unfortunately surprised 
in hospitals. Under the anesthetic 
thev sometimes talked, and then, if 
they were adults, they were im- 
mediately corrected by means of 
Steyner’s lobotomy. It had been 
learned that adults did not respond 
to therapy. 

There was never any organiza- 
tion, any underground, of misfits. 

THE HAPPY CLOWN 



An underground presupposes in- 
justice to be fought, cruelty to be 
resisted, and there was no injustice 
and no cruelty. The mass of people 
were kind, and their leaders, duly 
and fairly elected, were kind. They 
all sincerely believed in the gospel 
of efficiency and conformity and 
kindness. It had made the world a 
wonderful place to live in, full of 
wonderful things to make and buy 
and consume (all wonderfully ad- 
vertised), and if one were a misfit 
and the doctors found it out and 
gave one a Steyner, it was only to 
make one happy, so that one could 
appreciate what a wonderful world 
it was. 

Steven met no nonconformists at 
the School of Television Arts, and 
none while he was acting in “The 
Happy Life” until Denise Cottrell 
joined the cast. Denise — called 
Denny, of course — was a pleasantly 
plain young woman with a whimsi- 
cal face which photographed pret- 
ty, and remarkable dark blue eyes. 
It was her eyes which first made 
Steven wonder. They mirrored his 
own hope, and longing, and the 
desperate loneliness of the exile. 

For two months they were to- 
gether as often as they could be, 
talking intellectual treason in pub- 
lic under cover of conventional 
faces, and talking intellectual trea- 
son in private with excitement and 
laughter and sometimes tears — fall- 
ing in love. They planned, after 
much discussion, to be married and 
to bring up a dozen clever rebel chil- 
dren. Denise said soberly, “They’d 
better be clever, because they’ll 
have to learn to hide.” 

They made love in Denise’s 

111 




apartment when her roommate 
Pauline — Polly — ^was out, as awk- 
wardly as if there had never been 
any group experimentation or hap- 
py affairs. Denise said wonderingly, 
“When you really love someone it’s 
all new. Isn’t that strange?” and 
Steven said, kissing her, “No, not 
strange at all.” 

He took her to meet his family — 
Denise’s family lived three thousand 
miles away — and she behaved with 
such perfect decorum and charm 
that Richard and Harriet were de- 
lighted and as eager as Steven for 
the wedding. Steven had agreed re- 
luctantly to put it off until Denise 
had a chance to introduce him to 
her parents; they were coming East 
at Christmas. She laughed over it 
and said, “I’m being terribly con- 
ventional, darling, but that’s one 
convention I like.” 

While they waited, Steven’s 
agent secured a really unprece- 
dented opportunity for so young 
and relatively untried an actor. The 
current Happy Clown was unhap- 
pily retiring, by reason of age and 
infirmity, and Steven’s agent ar- 
ranged a tryout for the part. He 
said, “Give it all you got, kid; it’s 
the chance of the century.” 

Steven said, “Sure, Joey,” and 
allowed his sensitive face to register 
all the proper emotions. Actually 
his emotions were, in the vernacu- 
lar of a previous century, mixed. 
He loathed the whole concept of 
the Happy Clown — but there was 
money in it, and Steven was not 
rebel enough to despise money. 
With money he could retire early, 
go away somewhere with Denise, 

112 



to some coimtry place where they 
could be relatively free of pressure. 

Over staggering competition he 
got the part. He called Denise up 
at once from a booth at the studio 
to tell her. Polly answered the 
phone, looking pale and frightened 
over the viewer, and said rapidly, 
“Oh, Stevie, I’ve been trying to get 
you for an hour. Denny’s sick. They 
took her to the hospital!” 

Steven sat back against the hard 
wall of the booth, feeling cold, the 
receiver slack in his hand. He said, 
“What’s the matter with her? 
Which hospital?” 

“Ap-pendicitis. Happy Hour.” 
Polly began to cry. “Oh, Stevie, I 
feel so — ” 

“I’ll go right over.” He cut her 
off abruptly and went. 

The doctors caught Denise’s ap- 
pendix in time to avoid the neces- 
sary but rarely fatal complications 
. but under the anesthetic she 
talked, revealing enough about her 
opinion of television, and the Hap- 
py Clown cult, and the state of 
society in general, to cause her 
doctors to raise their eyebrows pity- 
ingly and perform the Steyner at 
once. While Steven sat unknowing 
in the waiting room, smoking a full 
pack of Marquis cigarettes, the 
thing was done. 

At last the doctor came out to 
him and said what was always said 
in such cases. “It was necessary to 
do something — ^you understand, no 
mention — ” and for a moment 
Steven felt so ill that he was grate- 
ful for the little ampoule the doctor 
broke and held under his nose. 
They always carried those when 
they had to give news of a Steyner 

ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




to relatives or sweethearts or 
friends. 

The doctor said, “All right now? 
Good . You’ll be careful, of 
course. She may be conscious for 
a minute ; there’s no harm in it yet, 
she won’t move or touch the — ” 
Steven said, “I’ll be careful.” 

He was still feeling ill when they 
let him in to see Denise. He sat 
down beside her bed and spoke to 
her urgently. “Denise, talk to me. 
Please, Denise!” 

She opened her eyes, looked at 
him drowsily and smiled. “Oh, 
Stevie, I’m so glad you came. I’ve 
been wanting you, darling.” 
Steven said, “Denise — ” 

She frowned. “Why do you call 
me that? Call me Denny. Did you 
get the part, darling?” 

He drew back a little. “Yes, I got 
it.” 

She gave him a radiant smile. 
“That’s wonderful ! I’m so proud of 
you, Stevie.” She slept again. 

That night in the HYM dormi- 
tory Steven did not sleep. He lay 
quiet, tense, hoping for the relief 
of tears, but it did not come. 



TEVEN WENT to see Denise 
every day though after the first 
time she was not awake to know 
him. The doctors were keeping her 
under sedation until the head band- 
age could be removed. So far as 
Denise was to know, she had gone to 
the hospital simply for a rather pro- 
tracted appendectomy. Looking at 
her, Steven knew that he could 
never leave her. He had loved her 
completely; he would love her now 
with as much of himself as she 



would need or understand. 

For a while he waited to be kind- 
ly questioned, to be thoroughly ex- 
amined, to be tenderly given the 
shot in the arm and to awake like 
her, but nobody came. Denise had 
apparently said nothing about him. 
Some censor or other — perhaps it 
was the censor of love — ^had kept 
her from even saying his name. 

For a while Steven considered 
confessing to somebody that he was 
a — ^what? — an unacceptable mem- 
ber of society. Then they would 
make him like Denise. He shud- 
dered. Did he really want to be like 
Denise? Some stubborn pride in 
him refused it. 

When Denise left the hospital for 
the hotel where she would stay un- 
til the wedding, Steven was more 
gentle with her than ever, kinder 
and more loving. He made her 
very happy. He made love to her 
again, and it was like loving a ghost 
— no, it was like loving a fine beau- 
tiful body without the ghost, with- 
out the spirit. He returned to the 
HYM to lie sleepless amid the 
breathings and mutterings of the 
other young men, turning restlessly 
in his bed, feeling oppressed, tor- 
mented, strung on wires. 

He rehearsed feverishly for the 
part of the Happy Clown, and be- 
cause he was a fine craftsman and 
a conscientious artist he continued 
to give it all he had. The sponsors 
were pleased. A week before Christ- 
mas the current Happy Clown re- 
tired and hobbled off to a nursing 
home. There was no fanfare — the 
public was not to realize that the 
Happy Clown was mortal — and 
Steven took over with no visible

change. For five days he played the 
part to perfection. 

On the sixth day he performed 
as usual, perhaps a little better. His 
commercials had a special fervor, 
and the sponsors exchanged happy 
glances. Denise was sitting in the 
booth with them; she smiled at 
Steven lovingly through the glass. 

Steven was running a little fast 
tonight. The engineer made stretch- 
ing motions with his hands to slow 
him down, but he used up all his 
material, even the nugget, with 
three minutes to spare. Then he 
said, “All right, folks, now I have 
a special treat for you,” and moved 
quickly to the center mike. Before 
the sponsors, or the engineers, or 
the studio audience, or anybody in 
the whole American nation knew 
what was happening, he began 
rapidly to talk. 

He said, “Are you all happy? 
You are, aren’t you? — everybody’s 
happy, because you’re all sheep! All 
sheep, in a nice safe pasture. All 
alike — you eat alike and dress alike 
and think alike. If any of you has 
an original thought you’d better 
suppress it, or they’ll cut it out of 
you with a knife.” He leaned for- 
ward and made a horrible face at 
the camera. Under the jolly make- 
up and the artful padding, his 
mouth was shockingly twisted, and 
tears were running out of his eyes. 
“A long sharp knife, folks!” He 
paused momentarily to recover his 
voice, which had begun to shake. 
“Go on being happy, go on being 
sheep. Wear the clothesies, and eat 
the foodsies, and don’t dare think! 
Me — I’d rather be dead, and 
damned, and in hell!” 



Fortunately nobody heard the 
last three sentences. The paralyzed 
engineer had recovered in time to 
cut him off during the pause, and 
had signalled the stagehand to draw 
the curtain and the sound man to 
play the Happy Clown sign-off rec- 
ord — loud. Steven finished himself 
thoroughly, however, by fepeating 
the same sentiments, with some 
others he happened to think of, to 
Denise and the sponsors, when they 
all came pouring out of the booth. 
Then he collapsed. 

Steven’s Steyner W2is a complete 
success. He recovered from it a sub- 
dued, agreeable and thoroughly 
conventional young man, who had 
the impression that he had suffered 
a nervous breakdown. He was dis- 
charged from the Happy Hour at 
the end of January, innocently leav- 
ing behind him the broken hearts of 
three nurses and one female phy- 
sician, and went home to his par- 
ents. During his convalescence they 
were patient with him and passion- 
ately kind. In spite of the disgrace 
they felt, a disgrace that would 
never be mentioned, they loved him 
even better than before, because 
now he was irrevocably like them. 

Denise was lost to him. The out- 
burst in the studio, and the Steyner, 
and the loss of the Happy Clown 
part were cumulatively too much 
for her. She broke the engagement 
and was heard to say that Stevie 
Russell had proved himself an ab- 
solute fool. He was miserable over 
it, though he had only a hazy idea 
of what he had done or why Denny 
should suddenly be so unkind to 
him.

ALICE ELEANOR JONES 




The Happy Clown incident had 
passed off well — immediately after 
it occurred, a powerful battery of 
comedians, including the Jolly Kit- 
ten and the Dancing Dogsie, forget- 
ting rivalries to rally ’round in a 
crisis, went on the air to insure that 
it passed off well. They made cer- 
tain that every viewer should re- 
gard the whole thing as a tremend- 
ously funny if rather mystifying 
joke. The viewers fell in with this 
opinion easily and laughed about 
the sheep joke a good deal, admir- 
ing the Happy Clown’s sense of 
humor — a little sharp, to be sure, 
not so folksy and down-to-earth as 
usual, but the Happy Clown could 
do no wrong. They said to each 
other, “He laughed till he cried, 
did you notice? So did I!” For a 
while teenagers addressed each 
other as, “Hi, sheep!” (girls were, 
“Hi, lamb!”), and a novelty com- 
pany in Des Moines made a quick 



killing with scatter pins fashioned 
like sheep and/or lambs. 

But, around the studios Steven 
was dead. Steyner or no Steyner — 
and of course that part of it was 
never openly discussed — ^sponsors 
had long memories, and the con- 
sensus seemed to be that it was 
best to let sleeping sheep lie. Steven 
did not care. He no longer had any 
particular desire to be an actor. 

Steven went to work in his 
father’s supermarket and was happy 
among the shelves of Oatsies and 
Cornsies and Jellsies. He got over 
Denise after a while and met a girl

THE ODD GENRE ( Continued from page 3) 



At the recent 8 th Western 
Science Fiction Conference in Los 
Angeles: Ray Bradbury communi- 
cated an enormous amount of en- 
thusiasm as he related how he got 
his ideas and developed them. 
“Over my typewriter,” he said, “I 
have a sign that says Don*t Think. 
And I really try not to when I sit 
down to write a story. I just let 
my subconscious take over. A char- 
acter emerges, I delineate some of 
his characteristics and give him 
free rein, and as he runs on ahead 
of me, shouting back for me to 
follow, I try to capture the echoes

of his activities on paper.” He re- 
vealed the fascinating facets of the 
geneses of such stories a,s The Fog- 
hom, The Tapestry, and The 
Dwarf, crediting the inspiration for 
the latter to an observation made 
by his long-time friend Edmond 
Hamilton in the distorted mirror 
section of an amusement pier Fun 
House . Lou Place offered a 
delightful s.f. comedy short, in 
color, about an interplanetary trip 
to Pluto by two canine scientists and 
the monster they met on our outer- 
most planet . Ivan Tors, pro- 
ducer of the popular Science Fic-

tion Theater, was present to an- 
swer questions about his first series 
of 39 telefilms, and showed two, 
“Frozen Sound” and “The Lost 
Heartbeat” in advance of their 
channel releases ... In an adjoin- 
ing annex, many fans spent much 
time admiring the art exhibit of 
original paintings and photo- 
graphic effects by Blaisdell, Bone- 
stell, Schneeman, Fagg, Nuetzell, 
Dollens, Cobb, Hunter and others. 

The entire affair was sponsored 
by the Chesley Donavan Science 
Fantasy Foundation, a group of 
live-wire, teenage enthusiasts living 
in towns adjacent to Los Angeles, 
with Lew Kovner, Tad Duke, 
Mark Pinney, Chris Robinson, Ron 
Cobb and Paul Shoemaker most 
actively participating in the man- 
agement of the conference.

BRAINS vs. SUPER-SCIENCE 



WHAT HAPPENS when a lone 
commander has to pit his cunning 
against the magic of a super-science 
thousands of years ahead of any- 
thing he has ever seen? Captain 
Allen Hawkins was faced with the 
dilemma of delivering Earth and 
its civilization into slavery or wit- 
nessing its complete destruction. It 
was truly an “avoidance situation” 
— as the psychologists call it — and 
Captain Hawkin’s answer had to 
be the most facile one Man had 
ever been called on to make . 



AVOIDANCE SITUATION, a 
long novelette by James McCon- 
nell, is one of ^e most exciting 
space stories you’ve read in a long 
time. Don’t miss it in the February 
IF . Also in this issue: You’ll 
find situation, suspense, thrills in 
CATALYSIS by Poul Anderson. 
And those peculiar organisms wash- 
ing up on the beaches will leave 
you with long thoughts — ^when you 
read THE MARGENES by Mir- 
iam Allen de Ford . Plus other 
top notch stories and features — all 
in the February IF.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I recently had occasion to show 
the story “The Cyber and Justice 
Holmes by Frank Riley, which ap- 
peared in the March 1955 issue 
of IF, to Joseph Harrison, editor 
of the New Jersey Law Journal. He 
was much impressed with the story 
and the philosophy it expressed, 
and he has asked me to write to 
you for permission to reprint the 
story in the Law Journal during 
the coming summer. 

Mr. Harrison feels the story 
would be of particular interest to 
the profession especially since the 
State Bar Association here has for 
several years been investigating the 
feasibility of modest applications of 
modern processing machinery to 
legal research. 

— ^Vincent Biunno 
Newark, New Jersey 

We^re glad to extend permission to 



reprint the story in the New Jersey 
Law Journal . and delighted that 
s^f is pointing the way in fields 
other than space travel. 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

The straightforward policy evi- 
dent in your magazine of reducing 
extrapolation back to life and so 
giving science-fiction stories a gen- 
uine psychological, socialogical and 
scientific meaning is both surpris- 
ing and welcome. I would like to 
suggest that extrapolation in s-f has 
really been a search for wider 
vision and understanding by taking 
all types of problems and situations 
to their extreme. Along the road 
thousands of problems have been 
met and dealt with as fiction. Could 
it be that s-f readers and writers 
are now possessed of a balance 
and width and depth of vision very 
isolated in this world of specializ- 
ations and conflicting ideals? That 
the direct application of the psy- 
chological results of this vast voy- 
age into fantasy is a possibility? 

It seems to me that s-f represents 
a body of people whose width of 
vision could allow the full and free 
discussion of controversial subjects 
without resulting in unseemly and 
useless brawls. 

In conclusion may I draw your 
attention to the sum and substance 
of Jungian psychology in that a 
higher consciousness sees the con- 
flicts of life as though observing a 
storm in a valley from a mountain 
top; a result that is obtained by a 
similar voyage into fantasy. 

— R. M. Carrier

Perhaps Mr, Carrier has put his 
finger on the answer to that ever 
recurring question ^^What is sci- 
ence-fiction?^\ 



Dear Mr. Quinn: 

As usual, I enjoyed every story 
in the last issue of IF even if there 
was fantasy in it. You see I go for 
deep space drama, the more tech- 
nical the better. The two features 
“What’s Your Science I.Q.?” and 
“Science Briefs” are my real loves 
and I’m making up files on them. 
One can really learn a lot from 
these two features. The color re- 
productions of the moon-shuttle 
ships were out of this world. I’m 
a model plane builder graduating 
in rockets and space ships and the 
picture was an excellent source of 
a plan for a model moon-shuttle. 

Keep up the good work! 

— W. G. Brandt

Cigar shape versus spherical — 
there^s quite a hit of contention on 
that. However, proceed with the 
spherical — we^ll back you up — 
theoretically, anyway. 



Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I’ve been a reader of IF for close 
to a year, but have never written to 
you until now. Why? Obviously, 
because I never had an opportun- 
ity. IF’s no reader-departments-at- 
aU editorial policy put the proverb- 
ial damper on my letter writing, so 
I said Ae heck with it. If Quinn 
doesn’t care what his readers think, 
I’m certainly not going to break 



my back trying to get through to 
him. 

But, lo, IF is turning over a new 
leaf. Not only will the next issue 
feature “Hue and Cry”, but I’ve 
also discovered via “Fantasy Times” 
that another feature . (“Odd 
Genre”) . will be included. 
Needless to say, I’m pleasantly sur- 
prised. 

Like most prozine editors, I sup- 
pose you’re interested in readers’ 
suggestions. Well, I’m here to 
strongly suggest that you do com- 
pletely away with three of your 
present features. “Science Briefs”, 
“What’s Your Science I.Q.?” and 
“Worth Citing” are a trio of the 
most boring features that I have 
yet run across. 

As for the August issue, all the 
stories ranked from fair to very 
good. However, Isaac Asimov, 
Phillip Dick and April Smith take 
top honors. I didn’t like your cover 
this time, but then I seldom do. 
The last good one that IF featured 
was Mel Hunter’s moonscape on 
the April ’55 ish. Now there’s a 
boy that can draw! 

— ^Kent Moomaw 
Cincinnati, Ohio 

We^ll let the letter from W, C, 
Brandt and several others in our 
files give you an idea of an editor^s 
dilemma when he starts getting 
suggestions from the readers. In-- 
cidentally, we^ve got a cover by 
Hunter in the works, He^s been 
busy with some stuf for the mus^ 
eum of Natural History in NY, 
But we snagged him away from 
the fossils long enough to do one 
for us.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

This is to thank you for a mag- 
azine that’s worth its price and 
the space it takes up. I’m always 
sorry that I missed an issue or two 
of IF back at the beginning, but 
that’s my penalty for shying away 
from a newer book. I’m catching 
up though, and I have to admit 
(gladly) that I’ve several times 
pushed aside Astounding's more 
technical pages in order to get 
down to more enjoyable reading in 
more colorful IF. Others in my 
family, various relatives, scrounge 
through IF, and really enjoy read- 
ing it — while they never showed 
any interest in other s-f books I 
had lying around — which goes to 
show you’ve got a wide general 
appeal. Please keep IF smart and 
original, and don’t bother too much 
about following the well worn 
grooves in the s-f field. There are 
too many mags doing just that. 

—A. S. B. Hallam 
Maywood, Calif. 

Dear Editor: 

I’ve been reading IF for quite 
some time and find it highly en- 
tertaining; but I, for one, believe 
you could improve on two points. 
First, there should be more stories. 
Fast readers can finish the ish in 



no time, then have to sit back im- 
patiently for the next. Second, 
there are people like myself who do 
not fully understand certain 
phrases and terms and would like 
to know more about certain plan- 
ets. I am certain it would be great- 
ly appreciated if you would print a 
dictionary section in the back of 
each issue to enlighten such igno- 
ramuses as myself. 

— P. E. Hamler 
Roseburg, Oregon 

The first point can be covered by 
the old cry ( and true as all old say- 
ings are true) that good stories 
are scarce. The second, by our 
recommendation that you try the 
science quiz we feature in each 
issue. It's designed for both those 
who flatter themselves they know 
the answers and those who feel 
they'd like to know. 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

Aren’t you interested in the over- 
seas market? There are eight mil- 
lion people in Australia, a good 
many of them who read s-f and who 
would certainly appreciate the op- 
portunity to read IF. Please give 
the idea serious consideration.

not have been enough to engender 
the social pressure that had shaped 
his way of life without the catalyst 
that the single casualty of planet- 
fall had provided. Reston could 
still appreciate the irony in the fact 
that that single casualty should 
have involved the most essential 
pillar in the structure of the new so- 
ciety — the Polish priest himself . 

He opened the door and peered 
out into the snow. Little Piotr 
Pyzykiewicz was standing on the 
doorstep, a huge dish in his arms. 
“Good evening. Father. I’ve 
brought you some kielhasa and 
some golabki and some pierogi and 
some kiszki and — 

Father Reston opened the door 
wide. Being a priest had its draw- 
backs of course — maintaining peace 
in a monogamous society that re- 
fused to stay evenly balanced as to 
sex, for one, and making certain 
that his sometimes too greedy flock 
did not over-exploit the simple in- 
digenes, for another. But it had its 
compensations, too. For, while Res- 
ton could never have children of 
his own, he had many many chil- 
dren in a different sense of the 
word, and what harm could there 
be in an old man’s pretending to a 
virility which circumstance and so- 
ciety had denied him? 

“Come in, my son/^ he said.

SCENE ON EUROPA — This satellite, one of the eleven moons of Jupiter, 
appears in telescopes as a mirror-bright object with an extremely high albedo 
or reflective index. That is, it reflects back to the observer a large portion of 
the sunlight which strikes it. The inference drawn from this phenomenon 
is that Europa once had a heavy gaseous envelope which has precipitated 
out as a thick layer of frozen gases which now covers the entire surface 
with mountainous layers of ice. (Drawings by Mel Hunter)
