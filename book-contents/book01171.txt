“THE OPENING SEQUENCE ISA 
COMPLETELY UNIQUE AUDIO EXPERIENCE; 
A MIND-EXPANDING TRIP THAT 
TAKES YOU TO AN 



— Roger Elwood, Editor-in-Chief, Other World Records 




The Tower starts where 2001 left off. 



For the first time on record — a shat- 
tering involvement with the OTHER 
WORLD of stereophonic sound. 

Other World Records have cre- 
ated a new experience in sound and 
listening that will envelop you in an 
environment of sound movement and 
full-color audio imagery. 

Based on the short story by Thomas 
N. Scortia, the words and music of The 
Tower take you to another dimension. 

Feel the five-minute opening se- 
quence depicting transition to a gro- 
tesque world via the horrors of the 
nuclear holocaust. 

Live in the new dimension of The 
Tower for timeless moments until the 
mind-exploding climax grips you, 
shakes you, exhausts you and leaves 
you limp and awed at your contact 
with a different reality! 

Utilizing music, electronics and spe- 
cial vocal effects, and combining them 
under the supervision of the brightest 
talents in these fields, The Tower cre- 



ates an intricate fantasy, painting color 
pictures on the canvas of your mind.' 

Roger Elwood (the noted Science 
Fiction Iconoclast) also says of The 
Tower, “I was truly overwhelmed at 
the scope and intensity of the sound 
movement and quality. ..an experience 
I’ll repeat many times in the future.” 
The Tower is the first in a series of 
audio environments planned by OTHER 
WORLD Records, available by mail 
order only. You can take the ultimate 
trip for just $4.98. To travel to the

T he mountain was friendly. It 
had been growing for half a 
billion years, its slow cells feeding 
on rain and air and wind-blown 
dust, compacting them into a core 
of solid quartz. 

Fifteenth lived on the mountain 
with his people. When he had been 
young and small the mountain had 
been his whole world and he had 
not imagined anything beyond it. 
Now he was nearly grown. From 
time to time, now, he looked be- 
yond the mountain, though it was 
still home. 

It was not ail hospitable. Its 
summit was a rounded crown, 
carved with winding fissures, glow- 
ing with a blue bioluminescence 
brighter than the storms that often 
boiled around it. Below the 
summit, where the winds were 
warm and dry, the surface film of 



7 



shining life was tattered into dying 
shreds. The age-eaten stone be- 
neath was caving away from the 
vertical cliffs, adding black and 
shattered masses to the bouldered 
slopes, where the wild orgs nested. 
Fifteenth had never gone that high. 
It was too dangerous. 

Home was here below, where the 
dead stuff of the mountain had 
rotted into rich black soil that 
spread in delta plains all around its 
foot. Floods from the stormy 
heights ran down to water the 
forests and mosslands that reached 
all the way to the grassy flatland 
where the people ranged to find 
food and trophies and brought 
them back to the sweet slopes of the 
mountain. 

Fifteenth’s people were nomadic 
wingmen. From the heights on the 
side of the mountain they could 
launch themselves into always pres- 
ent orographic updrafts and spiral 
out to overfly the green rain paths 
of the plain. There were roots and 
fruits, waterholes and game. When 
the wingmen found what they 
wanted they swooped down and 
possessed it. It was a good life. It 
was the only life Fifteenth had 
known — yet it was not good 
enough. 

He looked around the camp of 
his people, testing a thought that 
had come to him. Across the flat 
plains rose that other distant 
mountain that his people called 
Knife-in-the-Sky. It was hard to see 
because of the uncertain light from 



the plains and the few forested 
parts of its slopes. Fifteenth’s 
people had never seen a cycle of 
light and darkness. They marked 
the passing of time by their own 
body cycles or by changes in the 
trees and animals, since they had 
no other clock on a world that 
showed nothing in its sky but 
clouds and, rarely, some faint misty 
gleam that looked like a swirl of 
silvery fire. But even when they 
could not see Knife-in-the-Sky the 
people knew it was there. For every 
org on Fifteenth's own mountain, it 
was said, there were a thousand on 
Knife-in-the-Sky. Here their 
clutches were scant and often the 
eggs produced weaklings. But new 
orgs were always coming from 
Knife-in-the-Sky to replenish the 
stocks. 

Once Fifteenth sat staring at the 
distant jagged peak for many thou- 
sands of breaths. Then he went to 
tell his brother that he had resolved 
to leave his people, to cross the 
plain, to climb Knife-in-the-Sky 
and steal a wild org’s egg. 

^’irou are young,” said his 
j[ brother wearily and fret- 
fully, “and you are foolish. Other 
youths have gone hunting the org. 
They do not come back.” 

Fifteenth stood stubbornly silent, 
hanging his head. His brother was 
the head of his clan, the clan in 
which fourteen other males were 
older and therefore more powerful 
than himself. Fifteenth did not 



8 



GALAXY 




want to show disrespect to his 
brother by disagreeing, but he 
could not make himself promise to 
give up his plan. 

“Only those whose minds are on 
the ground hunt orgs,” warned his 
brother. 

Fifteenth still did not speak. 
They were standing outside his 
brother’s new tent, pitched in the 
yellow light of a clump of fire-trees. 
His brother’s new wife was singing 
in the tent, grinding grain for the 
next meal. From beyond the fire- 
trees the slow clang of a black- 
smith’s anvil rang. The smith was 
Fifteenth’s cousin, Second. 

The brother carefully worked his 
awl through a double thickness of 
leather before speaking again. 
Then he looked up. 

“If you stay with us I will share 
my skills with you,” he offered. 

Fifteenth showed his astonish- 
ment. Their father had been a 
wingwright. As was proper, his 
skills had come down to the eldest 
of his sons. With a new wife, First 
would surely have sons of his own 
before long and his giving wing- 
wright skills to Fifteenth would 
deprive his own get of what was 
rightly theirs. 

“I thank you,” Fifteenth said. 
“But I will go.” 

“Knife-in-the-Sky is farther than 
it seems to be,” his brother said. 
“Why go there when there are orgs 
here, if you are determined to die?” 

“There are better orgs on Knife- 
in-the-Sky. I have never seen their 



lairs here. I know what they are 
there.” 

“From your mother,” First said 
gloomily. “Of course. But there are 
more orgs and stronger orgs there 
and they take care of their eggs. 
Besides — ” He looked up from the 
harness he was mending and scowl- 
ed across at the jagged, distant 
mountain. “Besides the orgs, there 
are the watchers.” 

“Why should they bother me?” 
“They do not tell us why.” His 
brother looked up angrily and in- 
cautiously pricked his finger with 
the awl and grimaced with pain. He 
put the finger in his mouth and said 
around it, “They-live beyond the 
mountains. They ride in the sky in 
machines the size of twenty orgs 
and attack all creatures that don’t 
obey them. And there are new 
watchers now. Little ones. No one 
knows what they may do.” 

“I’ve never seen a watcher,” said 
Fifteenth. 

“Not on the mountain. But to get 
to Knife-in-the-Sky you must cross 
the plain. You cannot do it all by 
wing. You must walk for many 
sleeps. I am afraid the watchers will 
find you.” 

“But if they do not,” said Fif- 
teenth, “I will come back riding an 
org.” 

‘‘You — riding an org?” The 
brother took his finger out of his 
mouth and spat blood. “You’ve 
never seen an org close up.” 

‘‘My mother did,” Fifteenth 
said. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



9 




H e turned and scowled across 
the plains toward Knife-in-the- 
Sky. He was a strong young man, 
tall even among his people, who 
averaged better than seven feet in 
height. He knew he looked a great 
deal like his mother — his father’s 
second wife, whom his father had 
stolen away from another band. 
She had been a First Man’s daugh- 
ter and her father had pursued the 
lovers on a tamed org until they 
had set fire to dried grass and es- 
caped under the smoke. She had 
handed on her lore of org-training 
to her son, teaching him where the 
eggs were found, how the hatch- 
lings could be tamed. 

It was time for him to use that 
knowledge. Because he was of an 
age to use it — and for another rea- 
son. The girl who had become his 
brother’s new wife had been the girl 
Fifteenth himself had wanted. 

The brother picked up his awl 
again. “If you have to be a fool — ” 
He shrugged and suddenly grinned. 
“I’ll make a new harness for you.’’ 
And so, for many meals, Fif- 
teenth hunted meat while his 
brother made the harness. The 
dark-eyed girl who had become his 
brother’s wife helped him smoke 
the meat, and if her presence near 
him was a steady pain he never 
showed it. And if she knew she 
never told. 

When the harness was finished 
and fitted he loaded himself and 
the three of them trudged up the 
friendly mountain toward the finest 



of the launching places. There the 
slope fell steeply away for a thou- 
sand feet. There the gentle cradling 
updraft never failed. From this cliff 
one could circle and soar more than 
a mile into the thick, sweet air and 
launch oneself many sleeps away 
across the plain in a single flight. 

They stood and stared at Knife- 
in-the-Sky and the dark-haired girl 
caught her breath and cried, “A 
fire in the clouds! Look!” 

Before them, even higher than 
Knife-in-the-Sky, a lance of silvery 
light was extending itself in a soar- 
ing arc through the bright living 
clouds. Neither Fifteenth nor his 
brother was frightened, although it 
was a strange thing to them. 

The brother muttered, “There 
was such a flame a hundred sleeps 
ago. Afterward the small watchers 
appeared.” 

“Has anyone been harmed by a 
small watcher?” Fifteenth demand- 
ed. 

The brother shook his head. 

“Then I will not fear if there are 
more. Goodbye.” 

Fifteenth kissed them both, 
grasped his buttocks with his hands 
and leaped headfirst into the air. 
When he was well clear of the rock 
he swept his arms up in the sinuous 
stroke of the wingman, extended 
filmy wings of scraped leather. He 
flapped and soared until his brother 
and the girl were almost invisible to 
him, tiny staring figures no larger 
than pebbles. 

Then he turned out of the up- 



10 



GALAXY 




draft and stroked through the air 
toward Knife-in-the-Sky. 

He did not look behind him. 
Even if he had looked he might 
not have seen that something 
shared the air with him, a cube of 
metal, bright on all its faces, 
brighter still with lights and lenses 
on the face toward him. It was no 
larger than Fifteenth’s fist and a 
long way behind him. 

A great distance away in terms 
of Fifteenth’s world (but only 
a step on an astronomical scale) a 
man named Ben Line Pert in watch- 
ed the holographic image of a flying 
primitive and turned away, shaking 
his head. “They’re skinny and 
funny-looking,” he said, “but, by 
God, they’re human. Figure that 
for me, Venus.” 

The girl beside him was not a 
girl. She did not look like a human 
girl except in the way that a statue 
does. She was silvery metal, thixo- 
tropic, anisotropic, tamed by the 
science of her people to flow and 
move like flesh. On her home world 
Venus had not looked human at 
all — for that matter she had not 
been female, because her race had 
not bothered with sexual distinc- 
tions in its development. She said, 
“It is not only human beings who 
live on Cuckoo, Ben Line. We have 
already found Sheliaks and Boaty- 
Bits — or beings genetically parallel 
to them. And we have only begun to 
look.” 

“We haven’t found any of your 



folks, though,” observed Ben Line 
cheerfully. “Guess you weren’t 
popular.” 

“As to that, Ben Line, how could 
you tell?” 

He grinned. Venus was an edited 
form of her species, specially 
tailored to operate in the Earth- 
normal environment of Cuckoo 
Station. 

He said, “I suppose we might as 
well retransmit these tapes. I think 
we need help, Venus. More equip- 
ment, more survey scouts. And 
more beings. I think it’s about time 
we sent people down to Cuckoo. 
What do you say?” 

The silvery girl was silent for a 
moment. Ben Line knew that, 
through her Pmal translator, she 
was communicating with farlink, 
the computer that processed all the 
manifold information-handling pro- 
cedures on the orbiter called 
Cuckoo Station. 

farlink was the station’s nerve 
center. It processed the tachyonic 
transmissions that replicated new 
personnel for the station. It co- 
ordinated reports from the drones 
they sent down to the surface of the 
strange object. It stored cumulative 
data, solved research problems and 
sent findings— such- as they were — 
back to Sun One. 

Its main terminal was a ring- 
shaped console inside the hollow 
hemisphere where Pertin, the sil- 
very girl and other beings were 
working. The beings on duty sat 
inside the console or rested or clung

or stood there as their anatomies 
dictated, with input devices within 
reach of their manipulative organs. 
The output flashed and shimmered 
on the screens that lined the dome, 
translated into the visual symbols 
of half a hundred cultures. 

Ben Line became impatient. 
“What’s the 'matter, Venus?” 

She did not move but her expres- 
sion, as far as she could be said to 
have one, seemed to cloud. “There 
is difficulty,” she said. 

“Difficulty?” That seemed un- 
likely. farlink was as close to per- 
fect as any machine ever made. It 
owned its own built-in power 
sources and many tachyonic chan- 
nels linked it to the banks of the 
even larger computers and research 
teams back on Sun One. And 
yet . 

Abruptly, before Ben’s very eyes, 
the myraid screens suddenly flick- 
ered and went black. 

There was an instant rumble of 
consternation. Cries and hoots and 
clangs of shock echoed all around 
the ring. From the console position 
nearest Pertin’s own a scorched-fur 
scent of T’Worlie dismay came 
from the bat-headed, butterfly- 
winged being named Nimmie. 

“What the devil?” he muttered. 
The screens were black for only an 
instant. Then they glowed with the 
green computer signals that 
spelled out the same message in 
half a hundred languages. 

REGRET INTERRUPTION. INTER- 
FERENCE DISTORTING INCOMING 



SIGNALS. ORIGIN OF INTERFERENCE 
NOT KNOWN. 

Venus whispered, “We’ve never 
had any interference before — ” 

Pertin had no answer. Suddenly 
he felt very lonely. The tachyonic 
channels were the only bridge of 
thought and communication across 
a gulf of space that was too vast for 
anything material to cross. With 
the bridge broken, the thirty thou- 
sand light-years between all the be- 
ings on board and their diverse 
homes became terribly real. 

The T’Worlie beside him was 
fluttering on frantic wings above its 
console position, stabbing at the 
keys and whistling at its mike. 
After a moment it rose from the 
keyboard and turned its five-eyed 
face to Ben. 

“Mode emergency — query impli- 
cations of signal distortion.” 

“I wish I knew,” Pertin said, 
shaking his head. 

“Propose conjecture. Assume 
sentient masters of Cuckoo. Query. 
Have they discovered us? Are they 
initiating contact? Query probable 
intentions.” 

“I don’t know, Nimmie. Do^ we 
know where the interference comes 
from?” 

The T’Worlie spun, punched a 
combination and all the myriad 
screens lit up. 

SOURCE UNKNOWN. DF PROGRAM 
INITIATED. 

And then, abruptly, the green 
symbols shimmered off the screen. 
Patterns of color flashed and van-

GALAXY 




tshed in the deep tanks that were 
their three-D vision screens. A new 
message appeared. 

INTERFERENCE FADING. STAND 
BY. SIGNAL RECEPTION RESUMING. 

The Sun One sign burned itself 
onto the screens — a red disk inside 
a thin green elipse: the artificial 
satellite called Sun One, inside the 
galaxy. Before it appeared the tall, 
glowing cone of a Sheliak official, 
back at Sun One. He was speaking, 
apparently oblivious of the inter- 
ruption, while his translator turned 
his soft hooting into Earth English 
on Ben Line’s screen. Green sym- 
bols overrode the image for a 
moment. 

INTERFERENCE HAS CEASED. 
SOURCE NOT TRACKED. 

Venus and Ben Line looked at 
each other. 

“What was that all about?” he 
demanded. 

Slowly she shook her silvery 
head. “At any rate, it’s over.” All 
around the dome beings were re- 
suming their interrupted chores. 
“One moment, Ben Line.” Then: 
“Yes, we have concurrence. We 
authorize you to transmit a call for 
additional survey forces.” 

Ben Pertin nodded and cued in 
the tachyon transmitter. Carefully 
he began to phrase the report that 
the tachyons would flash toward 
the distant galaxy and to the arti- 
ficial planet called Sun One — 
where all the races of the galaxy 
maintained the headquarters that 
had launched this survey party — 



and from there on to the home 
planets of scores of kinds of beings. 
His words might sooner or later 
reach his own world, Earth. 

Ben Line wondered if somehow, 
back on Earth, that original Ben 
Pertin who had volunteered for 
tachyon transmission long before 
might hear the voice of his double. 

But that was not profitable 
wondering. Behind it lay too much 
pain, too much loss, too many re- 
grets for what could never be un- 
done — including the memory of the 
girl he had married on Sun One. 
Zara had not lost her husband, but 
Ben, her husband, in this copy at 
least, had lost his wife, forever. 
And it hurt.

although Fifteenth was strong, 
launching himself from the 
ground was hard work suited only 
for emergencies. When at last he 
began to run out of strength on his 
first long flight across the plain 
toward Knife-in-the-Sky he was 
careful to choose a landing spot 
where hillocks would give him a 
small height advantage for the next 
launch. A tall tree would have been 
better, but here he saw only fire- 
trees and bee-trees and neither was 
any good for climbing. No matter 
how careful you were, when you 
climbed fire-trees some of the fire 
clung to your skin and, although it 
did not seem to do immediate 
harm, after a time you sickened 



THE ORG’S EGG 



13 




and died. And bee-trees were 
guarded by beings with a disposi- 
tion to assault invaders en masse. 

He did not sleep on his first land- 
ing, only ate from the stocks he 
carried, rested drowsily for a thou- 
sand breaths and then launched 
himself again. Flying over the 
marshes was unsatisfying. There 
were few updrafts — and those only 
weak ones — to climb in. Nearer 
home, generations of wingmen had 
located reliable springs of rising air 
in many places — where the lowest 
slopes of the mountain shaped the 
wind or where, for some reason, the 
ground was always warm. But he 
was already at the edge of the 
known world as far as his people 
were concerned. He could recognize 
some helpful signs. Nearly always 
fire-trees meant rising air, not be- 
cause the trees themselves were 
warm but because they grew only in 
warm soil. But the stands of fire- 
trees here in the marshes were 
spindly and infrequent. 

So he climbed mostly with the 
power of his lean, long arms and 
chest muscles and flying was steady 
work. But his purpose held and 
after every rest or meal or sleep he 
launched himself again and drove 
on toward Knife-in-the-Sky. 

He had known that mountain all 
his life, but he hadn’t known how 
far it was. He slept twenty-three 
times crossing the alternating 
marsh and flatlands past the edge 
of the grass, and eighteen times 
more crossing what was pure 



marsh, where he could rest only on 
hillocks and the steamy mist that 
rose around him while he slept was 
malodorous and cloying. Each time 
he knotted the count into the cord 
around his throat when he awoke, 
and looked toward Knife-in-the- 
Sky — and still it seemed no larger. 

Beyond the marches he crossed a 
seemingly endless carpet of thick 
bright moss that had a strangely 
sharp smell — he associated it with 
the electrical storms that rolled 
around the upper reaches of his 
mountain. It made him sneeze. The 
moss bore no fruit, gave him no 
game. He counted twenty-eight 
sleeps on his way across it and came 
out giddy with hunger and thirst. 

He came down, with the last of 
his strength, on the bank of a 
shallow river that rimmed the moss 
world. He kneeled and drank the 
black water until he began to feel 
ill. Then he looked for food in the 
forest on the far bank. Its plants 
were club-shaped and leafless, 
shining with their own cold light 
like dwarfed, warped fire-trees. 
Shining daggers of thorns guarded 
the hard red nuts they bore. He 
picked a few doubtfully and looked 
farther. But there was none of the 
game he knew from the grasslands 
near his home — he saw none of the 
tleet four-legged herd animals, or 
the horned, two-legged hoppers. 
His arrows killed a small weakly 
flying thing that fed on the nuts, 
but its flesh was tasteless and dry. 
He roasted some of the nuts and 



14 



GALAXY 




felt sicker after eating them than he 
had felt before. 

He summoned the strength to 
pitch his wings together to make a 
tent, pegged against one of the 
club-shaped trees. He rolled inside, 
curled up in a ball and tried to 
sleep. It was not easy. Fifteenth 
had never known insomnia, but he 
had heard old people speak of it 
sometimes and now he understood 
what the word meant. He was 
drained and aching. For the first 
time he began to wonder if he were 
not as crazy as his brother had said. 
His brains truly felt as though they 
were bound'to the ground. His 
thoughts could not rise and fly — 
they were weighted by fear and 
misery and depression. 

After a time he decided that he 
must eat, no matter what, and 
crawled out again. 

Here in the marshes the sky was 
darker than on the slopes of his 
mountain. There were fewer fire- 
trees and the light from the steely 
bright moss on the far side of the 
river was of little help. 

He felt dizzy and faint and when 
he saw the bright cube that whirled 
away out of sight he thought at first 
it was the imagining of sickness. 

TkjEVERTHELESs, his brain cleared 
1^1 almost at once. Once or twice 
before, during the long flights over 
grass and marsh and moss, he had 
thought he glimpsed something 
small and bright pursuing him at a 
great distance. But it had always 



hung just at the threshold of visi- 
bility. He knew that the watchers 
traveled in huge things that were 
bright and shiny. But this did not 
seem very large and until now it 
had never come close. He had 
heard of the small new watchers — 
was this one of them? He could not 
say. 

All he could be sure of was that it 
had not harmed him so far, but cer- 
tainly it would never have a better 
chance to do him harm than while 
he lay shaking and weak in the 
wing-tent. He had left shelter just 
in time. To have glimpsed the thing 
gave him much to think about. 

The efforts of thinking seemed to 
sharpen his mind and his will. He 
must regain strength before he 
slept. He stood up, drank again 
from the river and began to search 
for the sprays of flame-bright red 
bloom he had seen from the air. 
These marked clusters of a thick- 
rooted plant. When he found them 
he dug out roots and uncovered 
nests of blood-red worms he had 
heard older wingmen of his people 
describe as edible in bad times. 

The roots were sweet and white 
and good — the worms less good. 
They were gritty and revolting raw r , 
but he made a fire and soon learned 
to clean them of their digestive sacs 
before broiling them. He ate his 
first satiating meal in many sleeps, 
rolled back into the wing-tent and 
slept well, despite his alertness to 
possible danger nearby. 

He stayed by the riverbank for 



THE ORG’S EGG 



15 




three more sleeps before he felt 
strong enough to pack himself with 
roots and smoked worms and go on 
again. 

He flew steadily and low, saving 
energy, careful with the worn bands 
of his harness. He strained his 
neck, ceaselessly scanning the sky 
all around for orgs or for another 
sight of the small watcher that had 
fled from him by the river, search- 
ing the forest for signs of game, 
studying the horizon for evidence of 
updrafts that might help him. 

The dully glowing forests now 
sloped sharply upward. He slept 
seven times in a belt of fog and 
rain. With Knife-in-the-Sky lost in 
the lowering sky his target was 
gone. He set his course as much as 
he could by following the upward 
slopes. When those signs failed — or 
were doubtful — he drew from his 
harness the one gift his mother had 
given him that had been her 
father’s. 

It was a crystal-cased object that 
glittered like the small watcher. In- 
side it a needle spun freely, but 
seemed ever to quiver toward a 
single direction. His mother had 
not known much about it, except 
that the wingmen of her people had 
used such devices to mark the 
direction of flight when landmarks 
failed. 

The air grew colder as he 
climbed. When he camped for one 
sleep on a moss-grown rock he 
awoke shivering and chilled. He 
crept stiffly from beneath his tented 



wings and found the low clouds 
gone. 

He looked up and caught his 
breath. 

K nife-in-the-sky filled all the 
world ahead. The forests lifted 
toward it forever, rising piles of 
pale brown and gray and ivory, 
splashed with vast black masses of 
fallen stone. 

So high he had to stretch his 
neck to look, the mountain itself 
rose out of those broken boulders. 
Walls of black rock marched up 
and at the top of that unclimbable 
wall, higher than he could imagine, 
the jagged summit slashed across 
the rippling colors of the sky. 

He studied that summit for a 
long time, looking for orgs, while 
the damp wind that blew down the 
slopes of the mountain numbed 
him with unexpected cold. He knew 
the orgs were there. They were al- 
ways there — when they were not 
sweeping down to the lower slopes 
and the marsh and the grasslands 
and forests, seeking prey. Perhaps 
those distant black spots, so hard 
to distinguish from the motes of 
dust one sees on the surface of one’s 
own eye, were orgs — he could not 
tell. Whatever, they were still a 
long way off. He stepped back to 
see more clearly over that giddy 
wall, felt a sudden gust as he was 
caught off-stride. The ground slid 
away under him. He grabbed wildly 
for the anchor rope that secured his 
tented wings, but his chilled fingers 



16 



GALAXY 




slid off it. The wind spun him off 
the rock. He flailed his arms, trying 
to get his balance. The moss was 
slippery and the cold had made him 
clumsy. He went sprawling over the 
edge. 

The fall was only twenty times his 
height, so there was no real danger. 
Even without wings he could glide 
to some extent. He picked out a 
landing spot where a bank of crim- 
son moss promised some cushion, 
stretched out his arms, writhed and 
landed not too badly, considering 
the sluggishness of his muscles 
from the cold. A pink cloud of 
spores rose around his plowing feet 
and partly blinded him. He 
sprawled, sneezing and choking, 
then stood up and looked around. 

He could see across the great 
bowl of marsh and plain almost to 
the lift of his own mountain. Past 
the brown and yellow slopes be- 
neath him the moss world made an 
endless sea. The marshes beyond 
were traced with thin black lines of 
rivers. In the hollows lay white fog. 

He turned and looked up the 
rock to where his tented wings and 
supplies were. Without wings he 
could not fly, but he could still 
climb. Unfortunately he rock was 
sleep and he could not trust his stif- 
fened lingers to seek out holds in its 
crevices. He would have to climb 
the long way around. 

Without wings the feat could be 
dangerous. The combination of low 
gravity and dense atmosphere that 
his world possessed made the lifting 



of mass easy, but unbalanced the 
equation of wind versus inertia. 
Caught by a gust on a vertical face, 
it was quite possible he could be 
flung so far out that even the slow 
acceleration of his world’s gravity 
would crush him when he struck 
ground again. So he sought an easy 
way and sprang carefully from 
point to point. He was concentrat- 
ing so hard on his task that he al- 
most did not see the small watcher 
as it swooped past his head and 
spun toward the place where his 
gear waited for him. 

F ifteenth shrank back into a 
crevice in the moss and waited 
for attack. 

The attack did not come. 
Actually this small watcher did not 
seem menacing to him. Yet what 
could it want with his gear? He 
could hear nothing. He could see 
nothing — then, in a flash, he saw 
something startling — a bright flare 
of golden light that washed the side 
of the mountain and disappeared in 
a moment. 

Cautiously Fifteenth eased his 
way out of the little fold in the ter- 
rain and stretched himself to peer 
upward. He listened, looked, 
smelled, reaching out with all his 
senses. They told him nothing. 

He squatted for a hundred 
breaths, considering. Strictly 
speaking, there was nothing on the 
rock that he could not do without. 
Food, spear, bow, wings, harness — 
he could not make them as well as 



THE ORG’S EGG 



17 




the specialists among his people, 
but he could make them well 
enough to get by. The wings and 
harness would be the most difficult, 
but he had seen enough of his 
brother’s work to know that replac- 
ing them would not be impossible. 

Still, the gear on the top of the 
rock was his and he wanted it back. 

If the small watchers were the 
same as the big ones his only option 
would be to flee — and to do so 
would almost certainly be useless, if 
his brother’s stories were halfway 
true. But he did not think there was 
any hostility stored in the glittering 
little cube he had seen. 

So with great daring, slowly and 
cautiously at first, then more 
quickly and openly, Fifteenth made 
his way around a boss on the moun- 
tainside, up and over it, and 
emerged above the rock where he 
had slept. 

He had not known what to 
expect, but he had not expected 
what he saw. 

The cube was no longer simply a 
cube. It hung in air above the moss, 
not far from his wing-tent, steady 
as though it were nailed there, not 
dipping or even trembling in the 
winds. But it was growing some- 
thing. From one face of it a 
glowing, filmy bubble was spread- 
ing to form a sphere almost the 
height of Fifteenth. It became 
larger while he watched: 

The sphere stopped growing. For 
dozens of breaths nothing happen- 
ed, unless a shadowy sort of 



movement inside the sphere meant 
something. Fifteenth could see his 
gear waiting for him. He could 
detect no harm in the cube or the 
bubble. 

He did not come to a conscious 
decision, but in a moment he dis- 
covered that his legs were gathering 
under him and he sprang toward 
the top of the rock. He turned in air 
to bring his feet under him, landed 
well, spun to face the small 
watcher. 

And then something did happen. 
There was another flash of that in- 
tense golden explosion of silent 
light and for a moment he was 
blinded. And when he could see 
again at all he saw that the bubble 
had broken open, sliced from 
within like an org’s egg, and out o it 
was stepping — what? A man? 
Short, fat, squat, dark, curiously 
clothed — but yes, a man. 

Ill 

T he figure that came out of the 
bubble was twice as wide as Fif- 
teenth and nearly a head shorter. It 
wore strange bright clothing. 

The wingmen and their women 
wore no more than they had 
to — the harness to hold their neces- 
sities and fasten to their wings, a 
few square inches of cloth or shaved 
leather for ornament, a few more 
for modesty. 

By Fifteenth’s standards this 
man was fearsomely overdressed. 
His clothing covered nearly all of 



18 



GALAXY 




him. From waist to feet he wore a 
sort of bright yellow, loose second 
skin, which vanished under bright- 
colored soft boots. From waist to 
shoulders he wore a sleeveless 
tunic. His wrists were ornamented 
with broad, bright-colored bands 
that looked like leather, but were in 
colors — blues, greens and mauves. 
They dangled little pouches and 
bright shiny things that glittered 
and seemed to move. Even the 
man’s head was covered with a soft 
cap of bright orange color — with 
such apparel he could never hope to 
avoid being seen by org or watcher 
or game. 

His costume and his strange pro- 
portions were not all that was dif- 
ferent about him. Even his face was 
odd. He was surely much older 
Ilian Fifteenth, two or three thou- 
sand sleeps at least. But his face 
did not show it. It was not weather- 
ed or lined from wind or storm. His 
teeth were bright and even, as per- 
fect as Fifteenth’s own. 

All this Fifteenth saw in the same 
photographic glance that told him 
that the man carried no weapon. 
None at all — neither bow nor knife. 
Not even a club. Even so, he might 
not be without danger. His squat 
f rame had the look of strength. 

The man took a step toward 
f ifteenth. It was not menacing. It 
was comic. Fifteenth had never 
seen anything like it. The man’s 
slep was grotesquely energetic — it 
propelled him into the air. He came 
down, stumbled, caught himself, 



fell again in overreaction and 
sprawled to the ground. The ex- 
pression on his broad face was 
funnier than his ungainly tumbling 
act itself. Fifteenth could not help 
laughing. From the ground the 
man laughed, too. 

Then the man stood up carefully. 
He spread his hands as though to 
show he had no weapons. Fifteenth 
already knew that. He made no 
move. 

The man did something to the 
shiny baubles on his wrist. Then he 
spoke. 

His voice came from two places 
at once. It came from his mouth 
and from the bauble on his wrist. 
The sounds from the thing on his 
wrist were not the same as the 
sounds from his mouth, but Fif- 
teenth could understand neither of 
them. He bent his head in the 
gesture of negation. 

The man seemed irritated with 
his toy. He touched it again and 
spoke once more. 

This time Fifteenth thought he 
caught the suggestion of a word. 
Strangely, it came from the man’s 
wrist, not his mouth. And the rest 
was gibberish. 

The man shrugged and let his 
arm fall to his side. Then he 
grinned, touched his chest and 
spoke a single word. The sound of 
it was Ben. The man waited inquir- 
ingly, as though expecting a re- 
sponse. 

Fifteenth was not sure of what 
was expected of him, other than 



THE ORG’S EGG 



19 




that the man seemed to want him to 
speak. The man gestured, pointed 
to his wrist and made several other 
sounds. One sounded like pmal, 
pronounced very slowly and care- 
fully, but what it meant Fifteenth 
had no idea. 

He said, “I don’t know what you 
want me to do.” 

The man applauded, grinned, 
motioned for more. 

“Well,” said Fifteenth, “I am 
Fifteenth of the men in my people.” 
He paused a little suspiciously, but 
the man urged him on. Hesitantly 
Fifteenth continued: “But I am far 
from my people and no longer one 
of them,” he soliloquized. “So per- 
haps I can have only a word-name, 
like an outlaw or a woman. Are you 
an outlaw? But I am going to get an 
org’s egg. I will hatch it and tame 
the org. Perhaps 1 will call myself 
Org Rider.” He finished and fell 
silent, listening to the pleasing 
sound of the name in his mind’s 
ear. 

Excited, the man touched his 
wrist and spoke again. This time 
the words from his wrist made 
sense. They were poorly pronounc- 
ed, but clearly enough they said: “I 
am Ben. You are Org Rider.” 

The man saw that communica- 
tion had begun. He spoke again 
and the thing on his wrist stuttered, 
emitted a few nonsense syllables 
and then, very clearly, said, “My 
people far.” 

He gestured for Fifteenth to 
speak again. 



But Fifteenth had heard some- 
thing else. Frowning, he turned to 
search the sky. 

The sound was strangely omi- 
nous, like the hum of a bee tree. 
His first thought was, Org! Yet the 
sound was wrong. It was not the 
harsh scream his mother had 
described, but something even 
more fearsome. 

Then he saw it — a faint silvery 
glint high above. 

Watcher! 

I t was a spearpoint in the sky. It 
had no wings, but it moved so 
fast the boy could hardly realize 
what was happening. The man 
heard it, too. Astonishment spread 
across his broad face. He turned, 
bounced toward the silently hover- 
ing small watcher, fell clumsily but 
righted himself and touched the 
ship with quick, skillful hands. 

At once one face of the small 
watcher glared with a bright golden 
flame and a bubble began to grow 
out of it. 

Fifteenth did not stay to observe 
this performance. He ran for his 
weapons. He did not know what 
good they would be against a 
watcher, but no other options were 
open to him than to use them, 

A bright flash of light from above 
gave him a split second’s warning. 
Then something crashed nearby. 
Strange yellow flowers bloomed on 
the black rock and faded into pale 
smoke. A sharp reek of burning 
choked him. 



20 



GALAXY 




The bubble from the side of the 
small watcher had grown tall 
now — abruptly it flared brightly 
golden. Fifteenth was staring di- 
rectly at it when it happened. For a 
moment he was blinded. Bright 
lights were out of his experience 
entirely, except for lightning and 
the smoky glow of a campfire — the 
eyes of his people did not have 
quick recovery mechanisms. He 
could not distinguish just what was 
happening. 

Then he saw that the man named 
Ben was clawing at the bubble, 
trying to drag out of it some glitter- 
ing object that had appeared in- 
side. Again there came that sudden 
crash. A flash of light flared behind 
and above him and yellow flame 
and smoke exploded on Ben. There 
was a terrible scream. Splinters of 
rock tore at Fifteenth’s flesh. A 
hot, choking odor took his breath. 

Then blackness drowned him. 
His bow was in his hand, but he 
had not had time to raise it, or even 
to see what had killed Ben and was 
almost killing himself. 

C onsciousness returned out of 
a crazy pain-filled fantasy that 
was not a dream but a memory. He 
lay face down on hard, wet gravel. 
He was shivering in a cold, slow 
rain. 

His first feeling was one of aston- 
ishment at being alive. His second 
made him wrap his wings around 
himself to cover his nakedness 
against the rain. 



When he tried to move something 
tightened around his neck so that 
he could hardly breathe. Panic 
shook him. He tugged at the coil 
choking him, but it would not 
loosen. His hand flashed to his 
knife, but it was gone. He was tied 
by the neck like a food beast 
awaiting slaughter. 

Sitting up more carefully, he 
managed to get to his feet. He saw 
that he was tethered to a great 
spearhead-shaped machine that lay 
on the gravel. It was mottled in 
brown and yellow, but underneath 
was the glint of silvery metal. 

Ten paces away lay the butchered 
squat corpse of Ben. A faint me- 
chanical squeal came from the sil- 
very cube of the small watcher that 
had brought him. It would bring no 
one ever again, for the explosion 
had blasted it. It lay sparking 
feebly, cracked and broken, on the 
gravel. 

“Good to see you awake, boy.” 

T he booming voice caught Fif- 
teenth by surprise. He moved 
abruptly and was jerked back by 
the choking coil around his neck. 
When he caught his balance he saw 
a man taller than himself, red- 
bearded, green-eyed, grinning and 
rocking on his feet by the small pile 
of weapons and wings. 

“Who are you?” 

“Why,” said the man, “you can 
call me Redlaw. You’re a long way 
from home, Fifteenth.” 



THE ORG’S EGG 



21 




The boy kept off his face the 
sinking astonishment that this man 
knew his name. “I am not Fifteenth 
any more,” he said suddenly, a 
little surprised at himself. “My 
name is Org Rider.” For some rea- 
son he knew this was now true. He 
had ceased being the Fifteenth 
among his people. He stood alone — 
a man. 

Redlaw’s laugh boomed out. 
“An Org Rider without an org? 
Your brother was right, boy, you’re 
a fool.” Then he said, not un- 
kindly, “Oh, don’t be surprised. 
The watchers don’t only watch. 
They listen, too. We’ve been listen- 
ing to you for a long time.” 

“How? I never saw you before.” 
Redlaw shrugged and smiled. “I’ve 
never seen a watcher,” said Org 
Rider. “And you have never been 
on our mountain, I am certain.” 

“You’re making a wrong as- 
sumption,” Redlaw said. “I’m not 
a watcher. I work for them. As 
butcher in their galleys — ’’ he 
gestured at the blood-stained apron 
he wore — “and sometimes as trans- 
lator, when they want to know what 
people like you are saying. But I 
know you are truthful when you tell 
me you’ve never seen a watcher, be- 
cause they don’t look a bit like you 
or me.” 

“Then where are the watchers?” 

“You’ll see them soon enough.” 
The man stirred the weapons on the 
rock with a foot and peered at Org 
Rider out of shrewd green eyes. 
“It’s not you they care about, you 



know,” he said suddenly. “It’s your 
dead friend here. What do you 
know about him?” 

“Nothing,” said Org Rider 
proudly. Fighting back the pain and 
dizziness that were tearing at him. 
Dried blood on his arms and in his 
hair showed where he had been 
struck. No one had troubled to do 
anything about his injuries while he 
was unconscious. “He appeared 
from nowhere. I do not know how. 

I had never seen him before. This is 
true.” 

“Oh,” said Redlaw, “I believe 
you. Whether the watchers will or 
not is something else. But you’ll 
find out — one way or another — be- 
cause here they come now.” 

A section out of the middle of the 
ship dropped flat to make a wide 
door and a ramp. Five creatures 
came flapping out and dropped to 
the rock around Redlaw, staring 
from a distance at Org Rider. 

Though they waddled on two legs 
when they were not flying, they did 
not look human. They were squat 
and powerful-looking, like the man 
who had died so quickly and use- 
lessly. Even more so — they were 
barely half the height of Org Rider 
or Redlaw. But the ways in which 
they differed from humans were ex- 
treme. 

They wore slick bright armor 
that looked as though it grew on 
them. Their armored arms looked 
thick and muscular, and their 
wings were yellow-streaked leath- 
er — it looked frighteningly like

tanned human skin to Org Rider — 
and stretched from their arms to 
their stubby legs. Their faces were 
beaked. They had no necks. Wide 
black flexible ears spread out from 
each side of their beaks. Their 
multiple eyes were greenish bulges, 
proruding from each side of the 
head. 

Their hands horrified Org Rider. 
The fingers resembled squirming 
pink food worms as they palped 
every seam of Org Rider’s tented 
wings, every strap of his flying gear. 

They emitted a foul odor that 
struck him in a suffocating wave. It 
took his breath and stung his eyes 
like death-weeds burning. Even 
Redlaw, who clearly had had 
opportunity to get used to these 
beings was wrinkling his nose and 
showing distaste. 

The creatures squeaked to each 
other and then paused, big ears 
spread. One of them was holding 
the needled guide that had been 
Org Rider’s mother’s gift, the 
direction-showing trinket. Org 
Rider started to try to break free. 

“Easy, boy,” said Redlaw tightly. 
“You’re very close to being dead 
right now. Don’t push it.” 

T he watchers squeaked to each 
other, then once again went 
through the routine of palping his 
wings, his garments, his waterskin, 
his firepot, knife, coils of rope, 
empty pots. Then they moved like 
stumps rocking across the graveled 
rock to where the dead man lay. 



They did not touch him, but they 
squeaked again, this time peremp- 
torily. 

Redlaw scowled uneasily and 
puckered his lips to whistle some 
sort of message. It was not very 
much like the squeaks of the 
watchers but it was as close as a 
human could come, Org Rider 
thought, and the watchers seemed 
to understand it. They replied. 

Redlaw nodded and turned to 
Org Rider. “I’ve told them what 
you say. Two of them think you are 
lying. One thinks you are too stupid 
to lie. The other two have not yet 
made up their minds.” 

Org Rider was silent, letting that 
information soak through his brain. 

“You see,” said Redlaw, “this 
strange-looking fellow here is very 
disconcerting to them.” He squint- 
ed thoughtfully at the racked body 
that lay staring sightlessly at noth- 
ing. "In a way they know that what 
you say is true. In another way they 
are not sure. Why did he come to 
you, boy? By accident? They’ll 
never believe that.” 

“I know nothing more than I’ve 
told you,” said Org Rider stub- 
bornly. “If I die for it.” 

“You just might,” observed Red- 
law mildly, then started as a blast 
of whistling came from the 
watchers. 

His tone was suddenly harsh. 
“They want to know why you don’t 
carry the watchman’s eye.” 

“I don’t even know w'hat it is.” 
“The talisman of their service.” 



THE ORG’S EGG

Redlaw touched a sort of medallion 
he wore around his own neck. 
“Like this — to show you’re their 
friend and servant.” 

“My people are not servants.” 

“Maybe that used to be true,” 
acknowledged Redlaw. “Your 
people lived almost out of range. 
But times are changing. This friend 
of yours here — what’s left of him — 
is making them change. I think 
you’ll go away from here wearing 
an eye if you go away at all, Org 
Rider.” 

A burst of peremptory whistling 
and two of the watchers waddled 
toward the boy. The yellow coil 
around his neck tightened, strang- 
ling him, forcing him to his knees. 
The man warned, “Don’t fight 
them — it’s your life.” 

The bitter reek set him sneezing 
even while he gasped for breath. A 
leather wing slapped him into si- 
lence, knocked him down. A hot, 
hard-armored body fell on him and 
those pink, writhing fingers search- 
ed his body, prying into mouth and 
nostrils — every orifice and indenta- 
tion. The weight, the pain, the in- 
dignity, the lack of air all combined 
to fill Org Rider with a helpless 
fury. He could not cope with it — he 
could only rage inside himself until 
at last the weight rose from him 
and the watchers took their foul 
reek away. 

What might happen next was at 
that moment of no interest to Org 
Rider. He was preoccupied inside 
himself. He had never been so 



treated. He had never been so help- 
less, not even when the girl he was 
interested in had whispered to him 
that she had pledged to marry his 
brother. 

In pain and anger, Org Rider 
was conscious of one certainty. He 
would see the watchers paid for 
this. 

at length Redlaw’s voice boom- 
ed: “You can stand up, boy. 
I’ve made a deal for you.” 

He whistled sharply and the 
yellow rope fell away from Org 
Rider’s neck. 

“You’re going to wear the watch- 
man’s eye,” Redlaw ordered. “It 
will show them everything you see. 
If you have any further contact with 
funny-looking fellows like your 
dead friend here, they want to 
know about it.” 

“What if I say no?” 

Redlaw scowled. “I don’t care.” 
He tapped the square-bladed knife 
at his waist. “Maybe I didn’t tell 
you that they have a taste for 
human flesh. To them you’re an 
animal to be used one way or an- 
other. What you do is your gamble, 
not mine.” 

He paused, looking toward the 
ship. From the gaping hatch a sixth 
watcher flapped down. It was 
darker than the others as well as 
bigger, its stubby wings almost 
black. It flew directly to Org Rider 
and caught him in a reeking hug, 
clasping something around his 
neck. The contact lasted only a 



24 



GALAXY 




moment — then the large watcher 
fell away. 

The object was a heavy black 
globe, twice the size of the ball of 
Org Rider’s thumb. A slick black 
cord of some sort of leather held it 
around his neck. 

“Our captain asked me to tell 
you,” said Redlaw, “that if you 
lake it off he will do you the honor 
to eat you himself.” He glanced 
over his shoulder. The captain of 
the watchers had already returned 
lo the ship. The others were 
llapping slowly after him. 

“Goodbye, Org Rider,” said 
Redlaw. 

He turned and entered the ship. 
The hatch closed. At once a small 
curved shell tipped down along the 
length of the ship. Something 
whined. A gust of warm wind sent 
Org Rider staggering across the 
gravel and onto the moss. 

The ship rose and whined away 
through the sky. Org Rider watch- 
ed it until he was sure it was not 
coming back. 

Then he set about gathering his 
lost gear. None of it was lost or 
badly damaged, though it was 
scattered all over the rock and all of 
it stank of the death-weed reek of 
the watchers. 

As soon as he had it he strapped 
on his harness, loaded himself with 
what he had to carry. His torn body 
was sending messages of pain from 
the crusted wounds in scalp and 
arms and his stomach fought 
against the clinging reek of the 



watchers. He put them out of his 
mind. He did not even look again at 
the dead creature who had emerged 
from the bubble, or the glittering, 
broken toy that had brought him. 

He launched himself into the air, 
turned and with great, painful 
strokes continued toward the dis- 
tant peak of Knife-in-the-Sky. He 
did not look back. 

IV 

M ore than a hundred million 
miles away, far beyond the 
great broad curve of the horizon, 
the spinning wheel of the orbiter 
marched through its endless sweep. 

Ben Pertin turned away from the 
monitor screen. The image on it 
was cracked and shattered. What 
showed clearly was a ghastly view of 
Ben’s own dead, staring eye, peer- 
ing emptily forever into the gaudily 
clouded sky of Cuckoo. 

Ben looked guiltily at the silvery 
girl he called Venus. He did not 
think even an alien like her would 
fail to see the emotions reflected on 
his face and he was not proud of 
how he felt. To see oneself die was 
unsettling. The Ben Pertin who had 
just had his skull smashed and his 
body blasted on the distant surface 
of Cuckoo was as much himself as 
this other body he was inhabited 
here. 

I’m sorry, Venus,” he said. 
“Sorry?” 

He said, “I guess the mission 
down there was a bust. Still, we’ve 



THE ORG’S EGG 



25 




learned something from it. First 
and most important — next time we 
send somebody down we’d better 
arm him for bear. No more waiting 
till he asks for weapons and trying 
to get them to him in a hurry.” 
“Concurred,” said Venus. “Also 
editing appears necessary due to 
the gravity differential.” 

“Right. That light gravity is 
tricky. I — he was falling down all 
over the place. I’ve never been 
transmitted in an edited form be- 
fore,” he said. “I don’t know how 
well I like the idea.” 

“It does not hurt, Ben Line.” 
“Of course not.” 

The silvery girl curled one wing 
and moved closer to him, studying 
him carefully. “It is established,” 
she said in her chiming voice, “that 
my people and Arcturan robots, for 
example, experience less ego-dis- 
placement in transmission than do 
you or, for example, the T’Worlie. 
Suggestion. One of us can go on the 
next transmission to the surface of 
Cuckoo.” 

“That’s an idea. We’ll keep it in 
mind,” said Ben Line. In his heart 
he knew he didn’t want to do it that 
way. When the next transmission 
went, he would make it. There were 
two reasons, one practical, the 
other not. The practical reason was 
that Earthmen looked like the 
people who roamed this portion of 
the surface of Cuckoo. With edit- 
ing — to stretch them out and 
reduce their musculature — they 
would look even more so. The first 



efforts at communication had to be 
for the purpose of building up a 
store of language that the pmal 
translators needed in order to func- 
tion. These had proved difficult 
enough. Asking one of these primi- 
tives to talk to a robot, to a 
T’Worlie or a creature like the 
silvery girl was out of the question. 

The other reason was the im- 
portant one. Ben Line Pertin had 
thought it over carefully and, all in 
all, he had no particular reason to 
want, to go on living. 

Ben Pertin was not the first 
human being in the history of the 
race to reach that conclusion. 
Many, he felt, had forsaken their 
tomorrows for reasons far more 
trivial than his own. The thing that 
graveled Ben Pertin was that his 
options were curiously circum- 
scribed. With tachyon transmission 
a man could die and die and die — 
and still not be done with either 
living or dying. However many 
times Ben Pertin let the tachyon 
scanners memorize his body struc- 
ture and translate an exact dupli- 
cate to the surface of Cuckoo — 
and however many times that dup- 
licate met a gory death — he would 
still be alive in orbit. And he would 
still be hurting. 

Other men in his position could 
fling their lives away in a reckless 
gamble against death, and find ob- 
livion. He could not. The only 
gamble he could take was in a fixed 
game that he could not lose. The 
situation made a mockery of 



26 



GALAXY 




courage. Of selfhood. 

"I said,” the silvery girl repeated 
tunelessly, “the T’Worlie Nimmie 
is speaking to you.” 

“Oh, sorry.” Ben Line shook 
himself to attention and attempted 
a smile at the butterfly- winged be- 
ing that hung in the air beside him. 
“Hi, Nimmie. What’s new?” 

“ Theory,” whistled the T’Worlie. 
“farlink proposes explication of 
lachyon interference.” 

“Really?” Ben Line was diverted 
from his internal plan. “What’s 
that?” 

“f arlink identifies source of in- 
terference as exogenous to Cuckoo. 
Originates elsewhere. Trace-scan- 
ning locates source as tight-beam 
signal generated in our own galaxy. 
Vector closely equivalent to that of 
human sun, called Sol.” 

Pertin frowned. 

“1 don’t know about that,” he 
muttered. “It doesn’t seem reason- 
able. After all, there is only one 
lachyon station on Earth capable of 
this distance and that’s locked in to 
Sun One. Certainly it couldn’t 
interfere with reception here — ” 
“farlink adds,” shrilled the 
T’Worlie, fluttering up and down 
on its bright butterfly wings, “inter- 
fering signal can be identified as 
mating call of female of human 
species, beamed from your home 
world, called Earth, to self, here.” 
“Ridiculous!” Ben Line explod- 
ed. “Nimmie, that’s insane! 
Why—” 

He paused as a strong ammonia 



scent made him sneeze. “Wait a 
minute,” he said. “What does that 
smell mean?” 

“Query. Smell, Ben Line?” 

“The gaseous emission that reg- 
isters on my chemical-stimuli-de- 
tecting nerve sensors. I know you 
T’Worlie express emotions chemi- 
cally.” 

“It is laughter,” shrilled the 
T’Worlie triumphantly. 

“Ah,” said Ben Line. “Then that 
was a joke.” 

“Confirmation,” cried the T’- 
Worlie. “Successful one? Query.” 
“Pretty good. Sorry. You caught 
me off guard or I would have 
laughed too.” 

A whiff of ether-like sweetness 
expressed the T’Worlie analogue of 
hurt. “Regret joke unsuccessful,” 
Nimmie piped sadly. “Not all of 
communication falsified for pur- 
poses of humor. True that farlink 
locates source as near Earth in 
vector-distance not confirmed. Ex- 
treme attenuation of signal renders 
distance estimate undependable.” 
“Strange,” chimed the silvery 
girl. “Perhaps we should instruct 
farlink to assemble conjectural 
explanations of this phenomenon.” 
“You two go ahead,” said Ben 
Line. “I have to get some sleep.” 
“We will carry on while you are 
unconscious,” whistled the T’Wor- 
lie. Neither he nor Venus slept and 
both were critical of human slum- 
ber. “Personal conjecture: what- 
ever explanations, they will compli- 
cate our mission.” 



THE ORG’S EGG

d indeed they would, thought 
Ben Line Pertin as he headed 
toward his living quarters, located 
at the high-gravity shell of the 
satellite. No random tachyonic 
transmissions should be coming in, 
especially from the galaxy itself, 
where all known 'tachyon sources 
had been long since identified, 
located and compensated for. It 
was one more irritation in a life that 
had become increasingly over- 
weighted on the downbeat side. 

What I need. Ben Line thought, 
is a meal, a hath and bed. In that 
order. 

But he would not find much 
pleasure in those either, he knew. 
The meal would be out of a dry 
pack and into a microwave oven — 
and would taste like it. With only 
three human beings on the wheel 
and a dozen other races with dif- 
ferent diets also aboard, not much 
space was wasted on epicurean 
cookery. The bath would not feel 
much more satisfying. The wheel 
was in free-fall and the only way to 
bathe was through a sort of hose- 
down from jets inside a thing like a 
huge bottle. There was not a lot of 
pleasure in the experienced-even 
after you learned how to get clean 
without inhaling several gallons of 
water. And the bed, of course, 
would be solitary. 

Ben Pertin hurled himself out of 
the communications room in a 
savage mood. He was the first 
human being to reach this point in 
space, tens of thousands of light- 



years outside the galactic spiral. 

He was a conqueror by any 
standards the history books could 
measure. 

What he felt like was a victim. 

P ertin’s “bed” was a cocoon 
that could shelter, feed, pro- 
tect and nurse him — as well as 
entertain and even educate him. It 
felt like a prison. Fed and bathed, 
he floated in it and could not sleep. 

There was a sore place in his 
mind to which his consciousness al- 
ways returned — like something 

caught in a tooth that the tongue 
cannot resist probing. 

That something was himself. 
Another self: the Ben Pertin from 
whom he had been copied. That 
Ben Pertin was forty thousand 
light-years away, in the artificial 
satellite that hung in the Orion gas 
cloud and was called Sun One. To 
Ben Line Pertin he seemed both 
farther than all those lights — in the 
sense of representing something 
unattainable — and closer than Ben 
Line’s own skin. 

That other Ben Pertin — he was 
called Ben Charles — would be en- 
joying the domestic pleasures of 
marriage, as well as an interesting 
and productive career and all the 
amenities Sun One offered its 
citizens. Lucky man, thought Ben 
Line, hating him. 

Yet that man, too, was himself. 
Only a couple of months earlier 
they had been not only identical but 
coincident. That was before Ben 




28 



GALAXY 




Line had come here. He remember- 
ed perfectly well what had happen- 
ed. He had risen that morning from 
the arms of his new bride, kissed 
her goodbye — but only as any sub- 
urban commuter kisses his wife au 
revoir for the day — and entered the 
tachyon transmission chamber on 
Sun One. 

There the tachyon beams had 
scanned his body, built up a 
pattern of atoms and molecules and 
transmitted that pattern at the ve- 
locity of tachyons, the particles 
whose lower limiting velocity is the 
speed of light. And that pattern 
had been received here, had been 
reconstructed here, atom for atom 
and link for link. 

So on Sun One, one Ben Pertin 
had walked out of the chamber, in 
no way different from what he had 
been when he had gone in. He had 
done whatever he had had to do 
during the balance of that working 
day and at the end of it had 
returned again to Zara, his/their 
wife. 

But on the wheel, another Ben 
Pertin had floated out of the re- 
ceiving chamber and felt the instant 
shock of knowing that he had lost 
the gamble. He was the one on the 
wheel, which he looked at with 
some curiosity but not much plea- 
sure. 

If you had put the two Ben 
Pertins side by side, no clue could 
have told you which was the 
original and which the copy. Both 
were originals. Neither was a 



copy — except in some abstract, 
irrelevant sense that meant nothing 
when it was considered that each 
had a complete store of everything 
Ben Pertin had ever had, from 
DNA linkage to the last, most 
evanescent memory of infancy. 

There was only one real dif- 
ference: One was there, the other 
was here. One was living a normal 
life on Sun One. The other was 
doing a necessary job — without 
joy — on the orbiter, which he would 
never leave. 

That was the paradox of tachyon 
transmission: since it was only a 
pattern that was transmitted, the 
object being transmitted remained 
unchanged. No matter how often 
you left, you always stayed behind. 

Ben Line Pertin tossed angrily 
against the restraining web of his 
cocoon. That was the damned 
unfair part of it, his mind cried. 
Why couldn’t Zara join him? 

It would cost her nothing. Like 
him, one of her would walk out of 
the tachyon chamber on Sun One, 
the other would be here. They 
would be together. He would no 
longer be alone. 

He groaned resentfully, angrily, 
petulantly. 

The worst part of his resentment 
was that in the end it was directed 
against himself. It was his own 
fault that Zara was not here now. It 
was he who had persuaded her not 
to come with him at first, not until 
the orbiter had been made more 
comfortable. She had wanted to 



THE ORG’S EGG 



29 




come. But she had listened to him, 
had finally agreed and promised to 
come later. 

A lying, deceitful promise. She 
not only had not come, she 
wouldn’t even answer his tachyon 
messages. Not for weeks. First he 
had suggested she might come — 
then asked outright — finally plead- 
ed. No answer. 

When Ben Line Pertin finally fell 
asleep his dreams were harsh and 
punitive. 

H e awoke in time for an 
all-hands review of the ma- 
terial gathered on Cuckoo. 

In all, forty-one beings were liv- 
ing on the orbiter at that moment, 
counting collective entities as a 
single creature. They fit nicely into 
a cylindrical chamber not much 
more than fifteen feet across, partly 
because most of them were rather 
smaller than human beings, mostly 
because placement in free-fall was 
volumetric rather than planar. The 
sole T’Worlie acted as sort of 
general chairman for the meeting. 
Out of the bat’s head perched on 
his butterfly-like body he squeaked 
a short sentence and all around the 
room the pmal translators of the 
various beings rendered it into their 
own language. 

“I will display the information 
gathered so far on Cuckoo.” 

In the center of the chamber a 
holographic display quickened into 
life. It showed a deep red sphere, 
floating in emptiness. There was no 



hint of dimension, because there 
was nothing nearby to compare it 
with, but the voice accompaniment 
to the display began to give the 
values for its physical characteris- 
tics and all the pmal translators 
faithfully relayed the information 
to their owners. Radius, slightly 
under one A.U. Mass, about equal 
to Sol. Density, very low — less than 
what in some Earthly laboratories 
was considered a hard vacuum. 
And yet the thing had a solid 
surface. 

This was a familiar wonder to 
Ben Line and the other beings, but 
they listened anyway. So much 
about Cuckoo was still unbeliev- 
able. Not only did it have a surface, 
but on that surface lived its crea- 
tures. 

The sphere in the display grew 
and broke off into a section, which 
expanded, turned slowly to present 
itself to each of the creatures in the 
room. It grew larger and they were 
looking down on a landscape 
between two enormous mountains 
and there became visible the stran- 
gest phenomenon of all. The crea- 
tures living there seemed biologi- 
cally similar to some races native to 
the galaxy. 

Any connection was impossible. 

Cuckoo had never been part of 
the galaxy. Its present course was 
aimed arrow-straight at the Orion 
arm. It had clearly been on that 
course for a long time — and it had 
originated in some other star cloud. 

Ben Line Pertin, listening and 



30 



GALAXY 




watching, realized someone was 
touching him. He turned and saw a 
woman of the Purchased People. 
She rode the satellite as proxy for 
some water-breathing race from a 
star on the far side of the galaxy 
invisible to Earth and never named 
by it, Ben knew. 

She said tonelessly, “While you 
were sleeping, Ben Line Pertin, this 
came addressed to you with the last 
lot of supplies.” 

He nodded thanks — not to her; 
the imprisoned personality inside 
that skull neither expected thanks 
nor would know what to do with a 
courteous gesture — but to the dis- 
tant mollusc-like creature that 
owned her and operated through 
her body. 

He was about to turn back to the 
hologram when he realized what 
(he woman had given him. It was a 
message cassette. There was no 
reason for anyone to send him a 
sealed cassette unless it was pri- 
vate — and there was only one 
person who would want to send him 
a private message. 

That person was Zara. 

S uddenly Ben Line wanted 
nothing as much as he wanted 
the meeting to end so that he could 
put the cassette into his private 
holovision tank. But it wouldn’t 
end and he could not leave — the 
topic had turned to one of his own 
specialties, the meteorology of 
Cuckoo. Long since the orbiter had 
dropped automatic weather stations 



all along its trail and they had 
begun to show tentative patterns 
for the climatology and air-mass 
movements of the enormous sphere. 
It was only a beginning. In that im- 
mense ocean of air, the seeded 
stations sketched out only a line, 
but still Ben Line had to summarize 
what was known. 

As he finished, the farlink 
screens lit up with an overriding 
message. 

ATTENTION. PROGRESS REPORT- 
ED ON TACHYONIC INTERFERENCE. 
FOLLOWING SAMPLE ANALYZED. 

The computer blanked out, then 
displayed shaped waves glowing on 
the screens, followed by endless 
strings of binary numbers, while 
bird chirps sounded in the speak- 
ers. “Conjecture,” whispered the 
T’Worlie beside Ben, a vinegary 
scent of excitement showing that its 
equivalent of adrenalin was flow- 
ing. “Analysis shows message.” 

But Nimmie’s conjecture was 
wrong. The curved screens flashed 
again with the all-stations call of 
urgency, then lit up with the 
message in half a hundred scripts. 

LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF THIS 
SAMPLE NEGATIVE. TECHNICAL 
STUDIES, HOWEVER, IDENTIFY SIG- 
NAL AS COMMUNICATION OF TUN- 
ING DATA FOR TACHYONIC REPLI- 
CATION TRANSMISSION. PRESUMP- 
TION: SOME MATTER IS TO BE REP- 
LICATED FROM CUCKOO TO SOURCE. 

“Ben Line,” chimed the silvery 
girl in sudden comprehension, “do 
you understand what that means? 



THE ORG’S EGG 



31 




It means we can replicate our own 
matter at the source of this trans- 
mission. We can send a copy of one 
of us! We can find out where this 
signal comes from by sending some- 
one there who can report back in a 
language we can understand.” 

‘‘If he lives long enough,” grunt- 
ed Pertin. He understood the im- 
portance of what was being said, 
but in his personal scale of values 
nothing was quite as important as 
the cassette he had been clutching, 
all this long while, in his hand. 

And at last he was able to excuse 
himself, hurl himself through the 
passages of the orbiter to his 
private cocoon, squirm in, seal, 
and then slip the cassette into the 
vision stage. 

A silvery glitter of cloud sprang 
up before him and condensed 
into the face and form of Zara, his 
wife, looking meltingly beautiful 
and overpoweringly sad. 

She gazed at him silently for a 
moment, as though unsure of what 
to say. And then — 

“Dear Ben,” she said, “I don’t 
know how to tell you this. I’m sorry 
to answer you this way. The truth 
is, I just can’t face you.” 

She paused, biting her lip. 

“You see,” she said, “I’m not 
going to come to join you. I know 
how disappointed you will feel — 
disappointed in me, because I 
promised. But I can’t. 

“I’m pregnant, dear,” she said. 
She hesitated and added: ‘‘You 



know that Ben and I — I mean, you 
and I wanted to have a child. We 
were given permission before — be- 
fore you left. Well, now we’re going 
to — in about five months. 

“So you see I can’t come now. It 
would be one thing for you and me 
to live on the orbiter and to know 
that we’ll die there. Being together 
would make all that worthwhile. 
But not our baby, Ben! I just can’t 
do that. 

“Of course, after the baby is 
born . 

“If you still want me we’ll talk 
about it then. I promise you, Ben, 
dear, I want to be with you. All of 
me wants to be with all of you. 
There must be a way, but for now I 
can’t see what it is.” She hesitated, 
then said in a rush, “I’m going to 
stop now, Ben, because I’m going 
to have to cry. I do love you! Oh, 
God—” 

And the image faded and was 
gone, leaving Ben Line Pertin more 
alone than he had ever been. 

V 

O rg rider washed his torn gar- 
ments in a rain pool and spread 
them on a rock to dry, but the 
death-weed stench of the watchers 
was still in his nostrils. He was out 
of the storm area now. The rock 
where the stranger had been killed 
and the watchers had treated him 
with such contempt was far out of 
sight in the rain clouds. He was 
cold and his aches and pains were 



32 



GALAXY 




enormous, but he was alive and 
free. It was more than he had 
expected moments earlier. 

He fished bare-handed in the 
pool for horny brown scuttling 
creatures and kindled a small fire 
to broil them. They were much like 
pond-dwellers he knew from his 
own mountain and when they were 
cooked they tasted as good. He was 
overpoweringly weary, but he 
forced himself to catch more of the 
scuttlers and prop them over the 
lire to take with him. 

Then he wrapped himself in his 
wings and was immediately asleep. 

When he awoke the first thing he 
felt was the black weight of the 
watchman’s eye against his throat. 

His fingers closed around it and 
he came close to ripping it off and 
throwing it in the pool. But it could 
not harm him while he was wearing 
it, he thought, and he had not for- 
gotten the warning about what 
would happen to him if he took it 
off. 

Warm and dry, he filled his 
waterskin, caught and broiled one 
more meal of scuttlers, then strap- 
ped on his gear and dove out from 
(he hillside to catch the wind. 

He was more cautious than ever 
now, turning suddenly to search the 
sky behind him to see what might 
be following. Nothing was, neither 
small watcher nor ship carrying the 
repellent creatures who had marked 
him with the thing around his neck. 
He was not so far from the rocky, 
desolate upper reaches of Knife-in- 



the-Sky that sighting orgs would be 
too unlikely. But he saw nothing 
like an org . 

Until it was almost too late. 

The far thin scream drew his eyes 
aloft. The org was a pale brown 
fleck dropping out of that high gray 
haze, sliding down across the long 
blade of the summit. 

It grew as it came toward him, 
taking shape and color. A slim, 
winged fish-form of bronze and sil- 
ver: the body bronze, tapering to a 
narrow waist behind the stubby 
wings; the tail and wing-tips shin- 
ing silver. It was beautiful and 
terrible. 

And it was coming toward him. 

Org Rider came out of an in- 
stant’s trance to full realization of 
his danger. This was not a dream. 
He faced a creature that could kill 
him with a single careless rake of 
claw or tooth. And he was exposed 
in the open air, where its speed and 
skill were far greater than his own. 

He dived, flapping desperately, 
staring over his shoulder. The org 
drew so close that he could see the 
shape of the individual lapped tri- 
angular scales, bronze and silver. 
Its powerful legs unfolded, stretch- 
ing cruel black talons toward him. 
Org Rider closed his wings and 
arrowed toward a black crevice be- 
low, where two great boulders had 
tumbled together. Even in that mo- 
ment the beauty of the org choked 
his throat. To tame and control 
that power was worth the risk of his 
life. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



33 




But it seemed his life was already 
forfeit — his fall was slower than the 
org’s dive. His weapons were use- 
less, the bow hanging to his har- 
ness, the spear impotent during his 
fall. Even the knife would only an- 
noy the org — it could not hope to 
prevail against that wide red mouth 
spiked with shining teeth. 

On impulse, without thought, he 
snatched the cold hard sphere of 
the watchman’s eye from his throat. 
He did not even feel the bite of the 
thong as it broke. He flung it into 
the org’s great mouth. 

Confused, the creature broke 
away, lost momentum, soared past 
and away. It went by with a roar of 
wind and a strange falling note in 
its scream. It recovered almost at 
once, wheeled and returned . 

But by then Org Rider was deep 
in the crevice between the boulders. 



F or many hundreds of breaths 
the org stayed near the crevice, 
sounding its anger and frustration, 
scrabbling at the rock with its 
claws. Its intelligence was too high 
to let it come in after him — in the 
cramped quarters, his spear was a 
more deadly weapon than its claws. 
Yet it did not leave. 

Its nest had to be nearby. Org 
Rider knew that nothing else would 
keep the creature there so long. 
There was prey in plenty easier to 
find. Mere hunger did not account 
for its tenacity. 

The thought was like a sniff of 



dream fungus, intoxicating, dizzy- 
ing, a little frightening. Where 
there was a nest there were eggs. 
Where there were eggs there was 
one to steal. 

Methodically Org Rider un- 
strapped his wings and lightened 
his pack. He did not dare to fly so 
close to the org’s nest. He would 
have to move fast and carry nothing 
that he did not urgently need. His 
only way to reach the nest was to 
thread the maze of spaces between 
the boulders, where the org might 
not see him or would hesitate to 
attack. He wondered briefly what 
had become of the watchman’s eye. 
Had the org swallowed it? Was it 
broken, so that the watchers might 
come angry and avenging at any 
time? He could not tell. 

Leaving everything behind except 
for knife, compass and a coil of 
rope, he breathed heavily to charge 
his muscles, rocked to test his foot- 
ing, crouched and jumped. He was 
in the open for only a moment, in a 
long surge from shelter to shelter. 
The org was out of sight. He could 
hear its baffled screaming, but did 
not see it. Possibly it had not seen 
him. 

The journey to the top of the 
boulder pile was long and hard. 
Beyond it rose a naked cliff a dozen 
times his height. 

Org Rider could leap that 
height — any of his people could. 
Yet it would test his strength and 
he would be exposed while leaping, 
off balance and vulnerable when he 



34 



GALAXY 




landed. He peered out, saw no org, 
and leaped without allowing him- 
self time to be afraid. 

He soared upward, caught the 
slippery rock at the rim of the cliff 
and pulled himself up onto it. 

Before him lay a level mile of flat 
black rock. In the middle of it rose 
a rough pink cone. 

The org’s nest. 

Although it was in view, no more 
than a half a dozen long leaps 
away, it was not yet in reach. A 
great org hovered over it, scales 
gleaming in the blue light of the 
peak. It had not seen Org Rider, 
but if he approached the nest dis- 
covery would be a matter of 
moments. 

He needed time to think. He 
spotted a narrow crevice and 
scuttled to it, hugging the flat rock. 

Concealed and secure he drowsed 
and thought for a long time, but in 
the end the solution to the problem 
seemed as far away as when he 
began. He could stay where he was, 
hoping that the guardian org would 
wander away, but the hope was 
foolish. A far more likely eventu- 
ality was that the other org would 
give up its fruitless sentry duty at 
the crevice between the boulders far 
below and come up to join its mate. 
With two adult orgs nearby Org 
Rider’s problem would no longer be 
the stealing of an egg, but survival. 
Sooner or later the beasts would 
find him. 

But as he crouched and drowsed 
his problem was being solved for 



him. He did not know it at first. He 
heard raucous shrieks and realized 
suddenly that both orgs were now 
crying out their rage and resent- 
ment. He next became aware of a 
dull, distant slam, slam, slam that 
was unlik6 any sound he had ever 
heard. 

Cautiously Org Rider poked his 
head out of the crevice and was just 
in time to see a brilliant flare of 
golden light. 

Dazzled and partly blinded, he 
knew at once that again one of the 
small watchers was nearby. Squint- 
ing to see what was happening, he 
saw a naked machine in the air, 
quartering away from him and 
emitting the slamming sounds and 
puffs of smoke. It was curiously 
ugly, like a stick-figure of an org or 
a person — it had wings, but they 
did not move, were rigidly ex- 
tended. The two orgs were attack- 
ing it, screaming in fierce rage, and 
pieces were falling from it, broken 
bits that scattered down across the 
face of the mountain. One seemed 
to have the shape of a man, and it 
was from it that the yellow flare had 
come. But if it were a man he had 
forgotten his wings and did not 
know how to hand-soar to guide his 
landing. He tumbled end over end, 
disappearing from sight. The ma- 
chine itself slammed crazily on. 

Org Rider knew he would never 
have a better chance. 

He did not stop to think. He was 
out of the crevice and leaping for 
the pink cone in less than a breath. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



35 




Now was when he needed wings, 
but he did not have them. He could 
only leap, guide himself with his 
hands, come down with his legs al- 
ready under him and leap again. 
He could hear the distant slam- 
slam of the machine and the 
screams of the orgs, but he dared 
not leap high enough to see what 
they were doing, lest the orgs see 
what he was doing. But the sounds 
were still distant — and he was 
already tumbling over the rim of 
the nest. 

Built of stones plastered with org 
manure, it had a good, clean, dry 
odor, a little like the smell of parch- 
ing grain. The shallow pink cup 
held a single egg. 

Even in his mad haste Org Rider 
took time to look at it — and to feel 
his heart catch at the sight. 
Smooth, mottled bronze and blue, 
the egg seemed too large for him to 
clasp securely. But its surface felt 
warm and elastic, yielding slightly 
when he touched it — it had a 
friendly feel. 

The yells of the distant parents 
were not friendly. Hastily Org 
Rider wound and knotted his rope 
to make a sling for the egg. Its 
weight was almost nothing, not 
much greater than his own. He 
slung it over his shoulder, scram- 
bled to the rim of the nest and 
leaped away. 

The breeze had freshened. It was 
at his back and it made each leap 
half again as long as the one before. 
At the second leap he craned his 



neck around. He saw neither orgs 
nor the queer slamming machine. 
He could hear the distant angry 
baying, but it seemed less furious 
now. That was not good — it meant 
the adult orgs were calming down, 
presumably having destroyed the 
machine. It would not be long be- 
fore their fierce parental pugnacity 
drove them back to guarding the 
nest — and when they found it 
empty their rage would become in- 
candescent. 

Org Rider’s life depended wholly 
on making sure that they would not 
find him. He came to the edge of 
the tableland and leaped straight 
out, not even looking back. 

It took all his skill to guide his 
descent into the best hiding place 
he could see. The bulk of the egg 
was a sail that unbalanced and 
tumbled him — the one free hand he 
had for steering was not enough to 
make up for it. He hit hard when he 
hit. At the last moment he threw 
himself around to cushion the egg 
with his own body. 

He was — for the moment at 
least — safe. 

And the egg was his. 

H e had landed in a vale of boul- 
ders, half buried in banks of 
gray mossy stuff. A mountain 
stream purled and cascaded lan- 
guidly down the slope. Org Rider 
had chosen the spot for that reason. 
As soon as he could regain the 
breath that had been smashed out 
of him he scratched and leaped his 



36 



GALAXY 




way to where a wide bright ribbon 
of water rushed from a sill of rock. 

What he had hoped for was 
there — a dry place behind the 
waterfall. It would do. The water’s 
sound would drown out any noise 
he made. The spray would carry his 
scent away. The curtain of lazily 
falling water would screen Org 
Rider and the egg from the vision of 
the parent orgs . 

With a start Org Rider realized 
he was already thinking of the egg 
as though it were a grown and ma- 
ture Org — and his. He let himself 
grin with wolfish joy. The hardest 
part was done — his dream would 
yet come true. 

But now he had work to do. 
C autiously he ventured out and, 
one eye on the sky and both ears 
alert, tore armloads of moss out of 
the hidden sides of the boulders 
and carried them back to make a 
nest for his egg. When at last it lay 
safe he took time to rock back on 
his haunches and inspect it. 

It was there, real and true and 
truly his. He studied every inch of 
its blue, bronze-speckled surface. 
It had no crack or flaw. It had not 
been harmed by the abduction and, 
best of all, from its warmth and 
certain mysterious movements in- 
side it, it showed every indication of 
being very close to hatching. 

His heart filled to bursting with 
joy and pride, Org Rider sat back 
and rested for a long moment, 
planning what next to do. 

As well as he could tell, he had 



come down near the spot where the 
cartwheeling figure from the slam- 
ming machine had fallen, but a 
long, long way from where he had 
left his weapons and supplies. He 
was in a sort of great natural 
chimney, with steep rock on all 
sides. He drank his fill of water 
from the falls and it was cold and 
sweet. He found nuts growing 
nearby and they stilled his hunger. 

His first step would be to try to 
get to his cache. 

He crept to the edge of the falls 
and looked up. 

As soon as he was away from the 
gabble of the falling water he heard 
the distant, agonized screams of 
the orgs. They had learned of their 
loss. The long moaning bellows 
sounded of rage and the promise of 
revenge. 

Org Rider saw a cluster of bee- 
trees nearby. The creatures who 
hived in them were dreadful 
enemies when aroused and it was 
known that they had some chemical 
loathing of orgs. They would, 
perhaps, make the adult orgs ap- 
proach only reluctantly. But what if 
they should smell out the egg? 

He could not guard against every 
contingency, Org Rider decided 
with a pang of worry and regret. 
Reluctantly he started out to hunt 
for a way to his cache and a good 
escape route from the giant 
chimney. 

At one point in his search the 
adult orgs came wheeling and 
shrieking overhead and he had to 



THE ORG’S EGG 



37 




bury himself hastily in the under- 
growth beneath a stand of fire- 
trees. Red insects shared his hiding 
place and their crawling over his 
flesh was maddening, but he dared 
not leave. He lay motionless, half 
drowsing, for a long, long time, not 
even lifting his head to see what was 
happening when the screams of the 
orgs were so close that it seemed 
certain they had spied him. They 
had not — of this he was sure only 
when he found himself still alive 
moments later. When the cries 
became distant he dozed again and 
dreamed a frightful dream in which 
his cherished egg hatched and 
turned into a black-winged watcher 
that stank of death- weed. 

He awoke trembling and found 
the orgs were gone. The skies were 
silent. 

He had not located his cache or a 
way out, but he found food of a 
sort, succulent stalks from a purple 
bush that tasted sweet and meaty, 
some torpid red watersnakes that 
were dull enough to allow them- 
selves to be caught. He returned to 
his waterfall feeling cheered and 
expectant, looking forward to see- 
ing his egg, touching it, listening 
for its heartbeat and observing the 
stirrings inside it. 

With a wary eye for danger he 
ducked under the lazy waterfall — 
and shouted with astonishment and 
anger. 

The egg was there, luminously 
blue in the half-light under the 
falls. But a creature crouching over 



it — a squat man-shape, black-hair- 
ed and nearly naked — was smash- 
ing at the egg with a red-smeared 
rock. The man looked up in fear 
and astonishment at Org Rider’s 
yell. 

And then, for the first time in his 
life, Org Rider felt superstitious 
fear. The man was the stranger 
from the small watcher, whom Org 
Rider had last seen dead. 

VI 

S ome tens of thousands of light- 
years away from Cuckoo, on 
the inner curve of one of the spiral 
arms of the galaxy toward which 
Cuckoo was hurtling, was a GO- 
type star of no great intrinsic 
interest, which had in orbit around 
it the planet Earth. 

Earth and its dominant race of 
humans were new among the 
galactic races. They were fully 
accepted as equal members. The 
streets of cities like Chicago and 
Peking were already accustomed to 
the sight of darting Sheliaks, glit- 
tering Arcturan robots and a hun- 
dred other races. Every major city 
had its own tachyon transmission 
center, through which flowed the 
traffic of the galaxy. All the centers 
were alike in that they were huge, 
new, towering over the structures 
around them and filled with the 
enormous mass of hardware that 
met the power requirements of 
tachyon transmission. Each wore 
proudly the gauzy spiral that was 



38 



GALAXY 




the emblem of the galaxy. 

Across the tiled floor of the great 
concourse of the tachyon center in 
old Boston a young woman named 
Zara Gentry walked with grace and 
assurance. She had been here 
before. She had been almost every- 
where, for Zara Gentry was a 
famous holovision personality, 
known everywhere for her on-the- 
spot reportage of the Earth’s doings 
to the Earth’s people. She had been 
everywhere and tried almost every- 
thing. She had, in fact, been a 
volunteer for tachyon transport 
several years before. One copy of 
her lived on Sun One. Another 
worked and lived in an orbiting 
station around the planet inhabited 
by the collective swarming crea- 
tures called Boaty-Bits, in the 
constellation of Bootes. Those two 
she knew of, for they were direct 
copies sent from Earth. But the 
tachyon duplicates could them- 
selves have been duplicated — and 
there could be a hundred Zaras in 
the galaxy. Or a thousand. 

It was strange, Zara reflected, 
how little she knew about those 
other selves. They were so much 
herself and yet so different — so 
close to her and so impossibly far 
away. 

The whole process of tachyon 
transport was loaded with trauma. 
She well remembered the quirky 
fears that had beset her when she 
had first volunteered to be scanned, 
mapped, blueprinted and recreated 
thousands of light-years away. The 



experience had been unbelievably 
scary. She had signed up and called 
to cancel her signature — had signed 
again and withdrawn again. At the 
end only her conscience had made 
her go through with it, because by 
then there had been such an in- 
vestment of time and training that 
she could not let it be wasted. 

So she had walked into the 
tachyon transmission chamber — 

And, moments later, had walked 
out again. And it seemed that 
nothing had happened at all. 

She had known with one part of 
her mind that every atom in her 
body had been identified and 
placed in its exact coordinates and 
that the blueprint that carried her 
minutest specifications had been 
even then racing, tachyon-borne, 
through the galaxy toward the 
semi- artificial world in the Orion 
nebula called Sun One. 

The other part of her mind had 
been wholly occupied with wonder- 
ing where her date would take her 
that night for dinner — and that di- 
chotomy had been as frightening as 
the process itself. 

It was still frightening and un- 
settling for her to think that 
somewhere someone who was 
exactly, identically herself was 
doing things she did not know 
about; might be terrified or joyous, 
angry or ill — might even be dead. It 
was frightening and unsettling, but 
one could not go on being fright- 
ened and unsettled forever. The 
first two Zaras had exchanged 



THE ORG’S EGG 



39 




tachyon communications for weeks 
and months and then, less fre- 
quently, for a year or so. They had 
even spoken “face to face” — in 
tachyon-borne holovision commun- 
ication. When she had sent the 
second copy of herself to the 
Bootian planet she had tried to 
keep in touch with her, too, but 
again communications had trailed 
off. 

And now Zara Gentry was about 
to expose herself to the trauma for 
the third time. 

She grinned to herself, dodging a 
Purchased Person who carried a 
hive of Boaty-Bits as she made her 
way to the elevators. I never learn, 
she thought good-humoredly. 

But this new prospect was excit- 
ing, she had to admit. This copy of 
herself was going clear out of the 
galaxy, to the strange object iden- 
tified as Lambda One and more 
familiarly called Cuckoo. With less 
fear than anticipation Zara Gentry 
rose to the hundred and eighteenth 
floor and reported in for her 
check-up interview. 

T he man in charge of her trans- 
port was old, tanned, lean, 
good-looking. He had bushy white 
eyebrows and a great sweep of 
white hair broke like high surf over 
his forehead. He maintained digni- 
fied objectivity in what he said, but 
he and Zara had become friends 
during the past weeks. 

“Zara, it’s nice to see you again. 
Well, tomorrow you make the great 



leap forward. How do you feel 
about it?” 

On her holovision program Zara 
would have answered, That's a 
dumb question. Look at the psych 
test pro file in my folder. You know 
how I feel better than I do. But here 
she said, “Well, a little scared. 
Otherwise fine.” And she smiled. 

“That’s natural enough,” he 
agreed absently, leafing through 
her folder. Suddenly something in 
it seemed to attract his interest — he 
stared at it thoughtfully for a long 
time. Then he raised his head and 
asked, “Have you seen the legal 
officer?” 

“Not yet.” 

“Oh, but that’s very important.” 
He was upset. “Please don’t put it 
off any longer, Zara. The docu- 
ments must be signed. You know 
that the copy of you will be, to all 
legal intents and purposes, your- 
self. She has an equal right to all 
your property and is equally obli- 
gated with you on the fulfillment of 
contracts, unless you state clearly 
in advance which of you shall have 
which property and responsibilities. 
You must file your statement of 
settlement at once.” 

“I will,” she promised. “I have 
done this before, you know.” 

“Yes, of course, but each time 
you create a copy you create the 
same problem.” Then he relented, 
smiling. “To be sure,” he said, 
“when you come right down to it, 
the problem is more legal than real. 
There isn’t much chance you’ll ever 



40 



GALAXY 




see your copy, is there? And a 
half-interest in a condominium in 
Buzzard’s Bay isn’t going to mean 
much to the copy of you that’s on 
Cuckoo. But there is always the 
chance some question could arise, 
so you have to file the statement. 
Otherwise they won’t accept you for 
transmission.” 

“Don’t make that too tempting,” 
said Zara, not wholly joking. 

“Mmm,” he said thoughtfully 
and made a check mark on her 
personality profile card. 

“I really do want to go,” she said 
quickly. “Or at least, I’m going.” 

He nodded. Hers was not an un- 
familiar reaction. If the tachyon 
boards rejected applicants who 
were doubtful they would never 
send anyone at all. “I see you’ve 
been issued all the cassettes.” 

“And I’ve listened to them,” she 
said. 

“So you’re about as well briefed 
on Cuckoo as you can get, I 
imagine. Do you have any ques- 
tions?” 

She said, “Well, those briefings 
are more distinguished for the 
questions they raise than the 
answers they give, aren’t they? I 
mean, nobody seems to know 
exactly why the object is as funny as 
it is. The size is all wrong for the 
mass — and nobody seems to under- 
stand how come there are creatures 
so much like humans and Sheliaks 
and Boaty-Bits on it.” 

He grinned. “If we knew the 
answer to questions like that we 



wouldn’t have to send out people 
like you. Our lack of answers is why 
you’re going.” He hesitated, look- 
ing thoughtfully at her papers. 
“Although there seems to be some 
more specific reason for your trans- 
mission. Do you happen to know 
why you were requested by name?” 

“No,” she said. ‘‘And I’ve 
wondered. The request came from 
Sun One, I understand. I have a 
copy here. I suppose she could be 
behind all this. But we haven’t been 
in touch lately, so I don’t know any- 
thing more.” 

“We could send her a message if 
you like. You could ask her your- 
self.” 

“Oh,” said Zara, “actually I’m 
rather intrigued by the mystery. 
I’m not fearful about it. That other 
Zara can’t have changed all that 
much in a couple, of years. If she 
thinks it’s a good idea for me to go 
to Cuckoo — then it probably is. I 
mean, after all, she is me.” She 
hesitated, then added: “The only 
thing that does puzzle me is why 
she doesn’t send a copy of herself.” 

The man said with visible plea- 
sure, “You don’t know how glad I 
am that you asked that. I can 
answer it. It puzzled me, too, so I 
got her records. The other Zara, 
you’ll be pleased to know, married 
a man named Ben Pertin. He’s a 
copy, too, of course — his identifica- 
tion is Ben Charles Pertin. And she 
expects to bear their first child in a 
couple of months. My impression is 
that she was anxious enough to go, 



THE ORG’S EGG

but not with an unborn baby.” 
“Ah!” said Zara, vastly relieved. 
‘‘I’m glad for her. What a nice 
thing to hear about yourself!” 
“And you yourself, Mrs. Gentry? 
I see you’re married. Are you 
planning a family?” 

“Why, very likely,’’ she said. 
“But I’m not pregnant now.” 

He nodded and closed her folder. 
“I think that takes care of all the 
loose ends,” he said. “See the legal 
officer. Get a few more shots. Then 
you’ll be all ready to go.” 

“I’m ready now,’’ said Zara 
Gentry. 

W hen she was through with the 
legal officer — an episode that 
left her feeling she had signed a 
part of herself into slavery — she 
took the express elevator that 
dropped her into the physical 
training rooms below ground. The 
splat of firearms told her the 
weapons class was in session. She 
tarried at the door, looking in at 
the range. The cassettes had been 
quite candid about the possibility 
of physical danger on Cuckoo. 
Several transportees had already 
experienced close calls and two 
were dead. Besides the known 
predators — winged creatures like 
flying seals, armed savages, crea- 
tures like Sheliaks gone mad and 
others — there were countless tril- 
lions of square miles of surface that 
had been only sketchily photo- 
mapped from orbit. What dangers 
they held no one could tell. 



The other thing that troubled 
Zara in the conscious part of her 
mind was that the Zara who went to 
Cuckoo would not be quite the Zara 
Gentry who filled the holovision 
receivers on Earth. Cuckoo’s sur- 
face gravity was so preposterously 
slight that the first transportees 
had nearly destroyed themselves 
leaping about like jumping beans. 
Zara’s physical attributes would 
therefore be slightly modified. They 
had promised that her appearance 
would not be changed, but she 
would be a little weaker, a little 
slower in reaction time. Even so, 
they said, she would have to watch 
herself; but it was thought that a 
little extra strength and speed 
might be helpful against the known 
and unknown dangers of Cuckoo. 

The class was ending. One of the 
men caught sight of her, grinned, 
waved, checked his gun with the in- 
structor and came toward. her. 
“Three bull’s-eyes and twelve in the 
first circle,” he said proudly, 
running a hand through his tousled 
mop of red hair. He was no taller 
than Zara and barely weighed more 
than she did, but the compact 
muscles were like steel. He would 
need a great deal of editing, she 
thought, leaning forward to be 
kissed. “I’m all set, dear,” she 
said. “We’re due for shots in half 
an hour, and that’s the last.” 

“Great,” her husband said, 
putting an arm around her. 
“Cuckoo, here come the Gentrys!”

Frederick Pohl, of course, needs no 
introduction to Galaxy readers. They 
know him as an author and as an 
editor who long gave Galaxy and If 
some of their finest moments— be- 
coming in the process the only master 
of these arts ever to win Hugo Awards 
both as an author and an editor. He 
has won four. Jack Williamson, his 
collaborator on The Org's Egg, which 
begins in this issue, is probably as 
well known— the two have worked to- 
gether on six novels before this. 

Here’s Frederik: 

“In writing The Org’s Egg and the 
Cuckoo series in general, Jack Wil- 
liamson and I owe quite a lot to three 
other people, two living American 
scientists and an ancient Greek. I’d 
like to acknowledge that debt. The 
scientists, of course, are Jerry Fein- 
berg of Columbia, whose notion of the 
"tachyon”— the particle that obeys 
Einstein’s concept of “c” as a limiting 
velocity by never going slower than 
the speed of light— makes the whole 
thing possible, and Freeman Dyson, 
of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced 
Studies, who proposed the central 
notion of Cuckoo, the Dyson sphere. 

“The series began in the fall of 
1970, when Jack and I were both at- 
tending a conference of the Science 
Fiction Research Association. Since 
Jack and I had already written six 
books together and thought it was 
time we did some more, and over 
coffee in the faculty lounge of a 
college where the conference was 
being held we matched up ideas and 
plans, and this series emerged. It was 
not just a matter of an adventure story 



with the technological trimmings of 
the Feinberg and Dyson proposals; 
we were trying to do something that, 
it seemed to us, science fiction alone 
of all kinds of writing can do: to show 
what the human condition might be 
under circumstances never before 
experienced. Human nature does 
change. There are things that are new 
under the sun — or in, around and 
apart from the billions of billions of 
suns that make up our universe. In 
The Org’s Egg Ben Pertin lives under 
different kinds of stresses and feels 
different kinds of pain from those we 
have all experienced, because his 
environment, particularly that part of 
it which has to do with replicating 
himself, imposes different challenges. 
We don’t think that the future means 
an end to human suffering— but as H. 
G. Wells once said, we can hope to 
suffer like human beings, instead of 
like animals. It is easy, and tempting, 
in writing science fiction to assume 
that nothing really changes, and that 
the man of a hundred or a thousand 
years from now will hurt from the 
same wounds we feel in 1974 — but if 
we write that way, we retreat from the 
real potential of science fiction, which 
can tell us what different wounds may 
be like, long before we or our children 
have to feel them in reality. 

“The Greek? Oh, yes — that was 
Aristophanes, of course, whose play 
The Birds first mentioned the place he 
called Nephelococcygia, translated as 
“Cloud-Cuckoo Land". 

“The Birds isn’t a new work (it was 
first performed around 414 B.C.), but 
we think it’s still relevant!” ★

Two men whose minds had 
won the stars — and lost 
all that humans lived by! 






I 

N ight after night the horrified 
face of Grigor Cernik animates 
my dreams. 

Nothing the psychomanipulators 



45 



can do for me deters Cernik. They 
have implanted smoky girls naked 
to the ears rolling in Tahitian surf, 
musical patterns, pastoral scenes 
from my boyhood. Nothing stops 
Cernik. When they fade — he is 
there. 

The Skyblue Colonel went away 
sadly. She may not come back. But 
Cernik will come again. 

He is there. As far as the word 
“haunted” has any meaning in 
these last years of the third 
millennium, I am haunted. 

I know how. On other matters 
such as “why?” I am not prepared 
to speculate. Feed that to your com- 
puter and squeeze some logic out of 
it. 

Naturally, the concept of haunt- 
ing would make the psychomanips 
smile in a sad, superior way. Their 
version would be quote persistent 
hyperconscious hallucination un- 
quote. My version of their possible 
version is gobbledegook, eedeepee 
speak — in short, crap. 

For one thing, I haven’t told 
them who is the intruder in my 
dreams. It wouldn’t do for them to 
catch a hint that I haven’t yet 
finished with Cernik. I won’t let 
him go that easily. He still has a lot 
of dying to do. I still have a lot of 
living to live. The whole thing is re- 
lative. Matter and antimatter, writ- 
ing in a mirror, the other side of the 
sky. Cernik. I. 

Who am I? You may well ask. 
After the first two hundred words 
of ravings we have a right to know 



who is this I who reveals himself 
only in terms of someone else. 

Who am I? Sometimes I ask 
myself the identical question. 

My name is Alan Durain. I am a 
hundred and ninety pounds hung 
on six feet two inches of skeleton. 
Hair brown, nose crooked. On the 
helmet of bone that keeps my brain 
from boiling over, I have cranial 
bumps which, some charlatan once 
told me, indicate exceptional 
powers. I talk a lot and often if I 
find a willing audience. But right 
now my virtual and only audience 
consists of the psychomanips. 
Hence these sketchy, hasty bab- 
blings, rolled cylindrical and push- 
ed into the cold-water faucet. Up, 
as they say, their pipe. 

Do you feel you know me better 
now? Let’s get back to Cernik. 

I did not know him for eighteen 
years. I was happy. I was cross-bred 
and carefully pedigreed into 
science. The DNA artisans got their 
calculations right. Coy phrases like 
“potential brilliance” and “im- 
mense perception” crept into my 
school reports. Grades were some- 
thing to be on top of. 

At seventeen I did my first inten- 
sive pre-university studies. At 
eighteen 1 found myself on the 
soggy campus of a famous East 
Coast university, one of an elite 
class of twenty all set to roll forward 
into distinguished scientific careers. 

Only one thing was missing. The 
gene jugglers had left me short of 
stamina for the natural selection 



46 



GALAXY 




stakes. I had all the urges but very 
little ability. You can’t have every- 
thing. The guardians told me this 
when I complained. I was bitter. 
There was nothing they could do 
about it. Let’s get back to you know 
who. 

He, too, was one of the elite that 
wet summer at Norfolk. Someone 
must have introduced us, but he 
didn’t make an impression the first 
time. The first encounter for real 
was startling the way that many 
things about Cernik often turned 
out. That first encounter was loud 
and ill-tempered. 

At a very late hour on my second 
night on the campus I was washed 
out of bed on a tide of sound. I 
didn’t know it then, but the wave 
fetched all the way from the middle 
of the andante from Kalipaj’s Sym- 
phony No. 3. Kalipaj, an almost 
forgotten middle-European com- 
poser, was the darling of the avant 
garde that decade. Cernik was 
avant garde. He had orchestrated 
Kalipaj for electrorobot complex 
and paranoiac. Cernik was the 
paranoiac. 

When I picked myself up off the 
floor my unwashed coffee cup and 
saucer were still trembling. No 
doubt it was an illusion, but the 
walls of my efficiency seemed to be 
expanding and contracting. Ka- 
lipaj, loud, brassy and percussive 
filled it like a sea. 

I hammered on the wall, but 
Kalipaj swamped my puny indigna- 
tion. I scrambled into a pair of 



slacks and rushed into the corridor. 
I beat on my neighbor’s door, 
rattled the knob. It wouldn’t turn. 

A door behind me opened and a 
girl with shoulder-length flax-color 
hair looked out. Her face, too, was 
twisted with pain. Her lips formed 
words I couldn’t hear, but under- 
stood: “What the hell is it?” 

I shrugged helplessly. I turned 
back to the door behind which 
Kalipaj raved. I hammered on it. It 
stayed locked. The music (music?) 
sucked my blows disdainfully into 
its whirlpool. 

“For crissake stop that goddam 
racket!” I bawled. A clutch of elec- 
tronic trumpets blasted me back- 
ward like a broadside from one of 
those old battleships. 

The girl came right out of her 
room. She didn’t have much on 
except a man’s long sweatshirt she 
obviously used as a nightgown. She 
put her hands up over her ears 
which pulled its hem inflamingly 
hipward. 

The pain of Kalipaj and the pain 
of trying to see too many things at 
once must have frenzied me. I 
sprang at the door. It shuddered, 
but held. I stood back and kicked 
the lock. The locks on those stu- 
dent pad doors were always cheap 
and ailing. It broke. And there he 
was. 

C ernik. He crouched on the 
floor like some strange projec- 
tion of a mediaeval sorcerer into the 
present. 



MINDHUNT

He was slight with a dispropor- 
tionately large, wedge-shaped head, 
the chin its sharpest point. He 
chose to wear monstrous exo-spec- 
tacles instead of contacts. They 
magnified speckled gray eyes. An 
ugly scar ran vertically from jaw- 
bone to collar on the left side. It 
looked like someone had been 
goaded into taking revenge, but it 
was just the place where some of his 
over-zealous glands had been mined 
when he was a kid. 

He commanded the center of an 
electronic nightmare that had taken 
over the room. Three tape decks, a 
control panel bristling with stops 
and knobs; festoons of wire linked 
it to amplifiers, distorters and other 
cunning musical boobytraps I 
didn’t recognize. 

If he hadn’t been facing the door 
I’m sure he wouldn’t have known I 
had burst in. He looked out of the 
raging sea of Kalipaj in a dazed 
way. He pushed the spectacles up 
onto the bridge of his nose and 
grinned. It was an elfin grin. He 
looked like a troll. The other hand 
moved lazily toward a knob on the 
control panel. 

The flaxen-haired girl had fol- 
lowed me into the room. She knew 
something about the electronic 
music complex because she darted 
past me and got to the knob before 
Cernik. 

Kalipaj shrank abruptly to a 
rumble in the guts of the machine. 
It was so sudden that my own voice 
bawling, “. goddam bloody im- 



becile ...” sounded loud enough 
to reach across the water to New- 
port News. 

Cernik twitched his spectacles 
again. ‘‘Welcome music lovers!” he 
said in his mocking, elfs voice. 
“Join the party.” 

Not surprisingly we didn’t. In the 
new silence we told him jointly and 
severally what we thought of him, 
Kalipaj, robot orchestras, his par- 
entage, avant garde music, his aca- 
demic prospects and, more philo- 
sophically, the duties members of a 
society owe to one another. 

As usual, I started out being 
angry and ended being spiteful. 
The girl was better. She was scorn- 
ful and eloquent and knew how to 
sneak in a pithy anglo-saxon word 
where it sounded most telling. She 
had a very neat compact behind 
that kept revealing itself pinkly and 
whitely when she waved her arms 
inside the sweatshirt nightgown. 

Cernik didn’t say much and none 
of it was an apology. He was un- 
ruffled, serene. Later I came to 
know that his outrages were not 
malicious or selfish. They were all 
designed by him exclusively to pro- 
voke a reaction. He never stopped 
working at being the still center in 
macrocosmic confusion. 

The bridge between the first 
eighteen happy years of my life and 
the , age of Cernik was only ten 
minutes long measured from bed to 
bed. Mine was still warm when I 
got back to it. Kalipaj didn’t re- 
turn. I heard Cernik moving around 



48 



GALAXY 




for a long time as I lay fuming and 
fretting. But the Pandora music 
stayed locked in its boxes. I finally 
got to sleep thinking about the girl 
and her sweatshirt. I wondered if 
her bed was warm and restless too. 
Three nights later I was in it, start- 
ing and ending one of the briefest 
love affairs on record. 

“I told you it wouldn’t work.” I 
said bitterly. 

‘‘I thought you meant it like the 
others,” she said. “Ergo, let’s bed 
together. Without commitment un- 
til the next time. But you meant it. 
You really did.” 

“Yes.” I turned from her. She 
held my hand. She was a warm, 
sympathetic lovely girl. I slept in 
her hand dreaming of the Strickes 
zones of the brain where my future 
lay. 

The girl’s name was Delicias. 
Sometimes I wonder at parents. 
Sometimes I think they have a cruel 
streak. Her surname was Disch. 
So — Delicias Disch! She seemed to 
get a kick out of it then. She was a 
delicious dish at that. But I thought 
it was a cynical bit of name-giving. 
Maybe she’d acquired her warm, 
loving nature learning to live with 
it. 

Before I woke, Cernik came into 
my head. 1 had a queer feeling like 
I’d been drinking and was tight. 
Cernik seemed to be studying the 
pin-prick electronic messages 
speeding along in my brain. That's 
interesting, he thought. His lips 
didn’t move. Dedicated celibate. 



Flake off Cernik. I told him. He 
had no business gatecrashing. 

I woke up angrily. Delicias 
nestled against me. She murmured 
into my ear and we tried it again. It 
didn’t work. I could hear Cernik 
laughing like a maniac somewhere. 
I think it was in my head. 

“Okay,” said Delicias. “Okay, 
forget it.” Then: “You might have 
told me.” It was the only time I 
recall hearing her reproach anyone. 

T he study course was intensive. 

We were an elite class, each 
member destined to be a specialist 
in his field. The competition was 
uncompromising, but I still needed 
to have the best grades. 

Friendships were formed among 
the other nineteen, but I never 
knew any of my classmates well 
except Delicias Disch and Cernik. 

Cernik quickly developed a repu- 
tation as a brilliant analyst and a 
mischievous crank. Everyone re- 
spected him as a scientist and 
loathed him as a classmate. He had 
a cool that could not be unfrozen 
and a hide like an elephant, one 
scorn or ridicule could not pene- 
trate. Except once. 

The story goes that Cernik 
bedded with Delicias for a short 
time that first fall. No one else 
would have borne him. But Delicias 
was sympathetic and warm and lov- 
ing and she needed love like she 
needed to breathe and she believed 
in experiment because she was a 
scientist. 



MINDHUNT

There was a story about the end 
of that affair that made the rounds, 
but I won’t bother to repeat it here. 
At any rate, Cernik dropped De- 
licias shortly and after that she had 
a long and fulfilled affair with a 
six-foot-three senior from the engi- 
neering class, called Sompting. 

Almost from the night of Kalipaj 
Cernik decided he was my friend. 
My fury then at the selfish misuse 
of the robot music and my open hos- 
tility when I heard the story about 
him and Delicias Disch made no 
difference. He persisted in sitting 
with me at lectures. He provided 
gratuitous advice on how to present 
my work to please individual 
tutors. He jabbed and prodded 
away at me verbally, discovering 
my leisure interests and offering to 
talk about them endlessly. He 
dragged me into the Music Society, 
the Inventor Circle, the Philosophy 
Table. He even presumed to discuss 
the merits of scientific and quack 
remedies for my girl problems until 
I bordered on violence. 

Whatever we did together, I 
never lost the feeling that his troll’s 
head and mocking eyes were sharp- 
ened to laser penetration, tuned to 
a keener wavelength than my own. 
I sensed him watching the moment 
after next, observing the neurons 
stampeding into thoughts along the 
surface of the brain. 

“What do you believe about 
telepathy?” he asked one day. It hit 
me rather like his intrusion on my 
one night with Delicias. 



We were downtown on a cold No- 
vember Saturday afternoon in an 
out-of-bounds bar drinking rum 
and coke. I took a slug of the cuba 
libre and tried to look like I was 
thinking while I drank it. “I think 
it might happen. In rare cases.” 
Unfortunately my answer didn’t 
cause him the embarrassed annoy- 
ance I remembered from that 
night. 

He said, “You know what I 
think?” He pushed his exo-spec- 
tacles up the bridge of his sharp 
nose — a characteristic gesture. 

I didn’t answer, but none of Cer- 
nik’s pseudo-polite overture ques- 
tions ever needed an answer. He 
launched into telling me what he 
believed. Reduced to essentials and 
avoiding the Cernik gloss of reason 
that could have confounded com- 
puters and proved black white, it 
ran something like this. 

He believed that primitive man 
and his forebears had possessed a 
well-developed sense, half-intuitive, 
half-telepathic. This had become 
blunted and shuffled into an evolu- 
tionary cul-de-sac by the develop- 
ment of speech communication and 
the individual’s self-awareness. He 
instanced observations made in 
the early twentieth century regard- 
ing certain primitive peoples of 
Africa and the South American 
jungles. He recalled the unexplain- 
ed transmission of news by them at 
a speed that outstripped the most 
up-to-date means of communica- 
tion then known; he said it became 



50 



GALAXY 




known as the bush telegraph. He 
spoke of the power of the witch 
doctors and juju, which could 
stretch out to claim victims at many 
hundreds of miles distance. 

“It’s a dormant power, Alan,” 
he said, staring at me out of his 
troll’s eyes. “If we could reawaken 
it, it would be of incalculable 
value. In space exploration for 
example. Faster than the photo- 
phone, more reliable than elec- 
tronic communication.” 

“Very convincing, Grigor. How 
do you propose to develop it?” 

“It won’t be easy,” he said. “One 
needs a carefully controlled series 
of experiments. One needs, for 
example, to find two individuals in 
whom the telepathic potential is 
very close to the surface. Familiars. 
Sympathetic brains.” 

“I suppose you already have two 
such subjects in mind?” 

The question was mocking, but 
he stared at me hard. “Yes, Alan. 
You and I. Let’s experiment.” 

“No thanks, Grigor.” 

“Oh, come on, Alan. Let’s do 
something instead of just listening 
to low-IQ lecturers telling us things 
we already know. Let’s try it. You 
can prove me wrong.” 

H e knew exactly the right hook 
to throw at me. When I didn’t 
answer immediately he knew I’d 
swallowed it. 

“Check your watch,” he said. 
“I’m going to take a walk to the 
phone booth on the next block. In 



exactly three minutes just clear 
your mind of everything. Concen- 
trate on the green light over there 
and when the phone rings it’ll be 
for you. Tell me what message you 
received. See if I come through.” 

He left the cafe. I watched the 
second hand measure a minute on 
my watch. I stared at the green 
light, trying to open my mind. 

Abruptly I felt as if a cold band 
were circling my head on the inside. 
With a sense of almost physical 
shock I realized Cernik had made 
contact. There was no face, no 
voice, just an uncanny presence. 
Like words engraved on magnetic 
tape. Evaluate and comment on

My God! Cernik didn’t go for 
anything easy the first time. A 
couple of minutes later the phone 
call light flashed. The bartender 
called me over. It was for me. 

I darkened the booth. Cernik’s 
excited face filled the screen. 

“You see?” he asked. “You see, 
Alan? Come on — what did you 
get?” 

“Dedicated celibate,” I lied. 

“You’re five weeks, two days and 
twenty hours out,” said Cernik 
sourly. “Come on — stop fooling 
around, Durain. I know you got it. 
Hell! I saw you get it. The damned 
language isn’t adequate — I mean I 
experienced it with you. Come on, 
read it back.” 

He rarely got that emotional.

I grinned. 

“Okay, Grigor. Stop shedding 
your skin. Quote, Evaluate and 
comment on Harrington- Jeans’ — ” 

“Great. Excellent.” He couldn’t 
wait for me to finish. “You know 
what it is? It’s the prime question 
in next week’s prelims. I’ve handed 
it to you. Research it all you want.” 

“For crissake, Grigor. I don’t 
need anyone to help me crib out my 
prelims.” 

“You’re missing the point, Alan. 
Do you realize what we just did?” 

“You patronizing jerk! You 
could have sent me something less 
embarrassing.” 

Cernik stared at me in dazed 
fury. 

“You dumb bastard,’’ he 
squawked. 

“Forget it.” I told him. “It was a 
cute party for a dull Saturday after- 
noon. That’s the last time I play 
circuses with you, Grigor.” 

But it wasn’t. That sonofabitch 
didn’t know how to stop once he’d 
gotten his antennae tuned to an 
idea. 

The Experiment (it had to have a 
capital E) became an obsession. 
The prelims came and went. I had 
opened the Analytical Paper with 
nervous disbelief. There it was. 
How else could it be with that god-

Cernik beavered away at me, some- 



times cajoling, sometimes reason- 
ing, sometimes raging. 

He had discovered that we were 
the only two constructs in the class. 
All the others had conventional 
parentage. He claimed this as a 
bond. He argued that maybe our 
exceptional powers sprang from it. 
He raved about extending the Ex- 
periment to a control group chosen 
entirely from constructs. 

II 

C ertainly there was a kind of 
attunement of an exceptional 
sort. From the first crude experi- 
ment in the cafe we moved on 
through that fall to more and more 
sophistication and refinement. We 
found by the use of a kind of key 
thought of call sign we could call up 
one another. We could do this even 
at considerable distances. Even 
when one of us was sleeping. 
Cernik became so absorbed with it 
that his studies began to suffer. He 
used the university data-processing 
and memory storage banks to pro- 
duce vast patterns of probability 
and review hundreds of case his- 
tories where any hint of esp was re- 
corded. 

His music machine was aban- 
doned in favor of computers and 
data storage. One morning in the 
small hours, surrounded by calcu- 
lations the point of which I had lost 
track of hours before, he stared at 
me jubilantly. “Alan. I’m going to 
write a paper and present it. I think 



52

we’re on the threshhold of some- 
thing big. I think either one of us 
could exchange with the other. Like 
going in and out of a house. We’ve 
reduced the body to a sophisticated 
container. One of us could die, but 
both of us could go on living.” 

‘‘Go to bed, Grigor.” I said. 
‘‘You publish that damn paper and 
both of us will be on a one-way 
ticket to rating zero. You know 
about unauthorized experiments. 
Forget it.” 

“We can’t let it go! We can’t!” 

“We can for tonight,” I said. 
“Put the tape and the computer 
away.” 

I don’t think he was listening. 
“We have to go on with it, Alan.” 

But I knew when I left him, still 
reluctant to pack up, that it had to 
be over. We were at the end of the 
line on the Experiment. 

I began thinking about how to 
break it the same night. I had to be 
careful in case Grigor turned up in 
my mind and read me. I shielded it 
from him, working away at it day 
after day. 

I didn’t get anywhere. All the 
time I didn’t get anywhere I had to 
humor him. I played along, cooper- 
ating in what to him was now the 
low-key side of his obsession. I 
avoided the big one, but I knew he 
was always thrusting, always work- 
ing toward it. 

Then the solution dropped on my 
head like Newton’s apple. It was 
lucky. It came from an unexpected 

source. 

* 



It was the New Year’s Ball. 
People went home for Christmas; 
came back for the New Year’s Ball. 
It was a big campus occasion. 

Delicias Disch was there. She 
was still having her long and satis- 
fying affair with the engineering 
student, but around two a.m. I 
found myself upright in her arms. 
It was some kind of switch-partner’s 
dance. It was gay and noisy and in- 
toxicated. 

‘‘Hi,” she murmured in the 
seething gloom. ‘‘How are you 
making out with the Crazy Elf?” 

“I’ll survive. Me and my sanity 
both.” 

“And the experiment?” 

“What experiment?” I asked. 

Delicias tilted her chin and 
stared mockingly into my face. “I 
often wonder what’s going on in his 
wedge-head. Don’t you?” 

I didn’t answer. 

Delicias asked, “Don’t you get 
tired of trespassers?” 

“They could be tedious. What do 
you know about trespassers?” 

“Enough.” She steered me away 
from a partner switch, keeping to 
the fringe of the dancers. Suddenly 
I got that tight headband feeling. 
My mind went blank then lit up 
blindingly. 

“What did you say?” I croaked. 

“Nothing.” Her pretty face 
mocked me again. “But you 
heard?” 

“For crissake!” I groaned. “Not 
you, too — ” 

“Uh-huh,” she said. “Me, too.

Ever since I was in bobbysox.” 
“Mind you don’t let Grigor find 
out.” 

■“I’ll mind,’’ she said. “You 
ought to mind, too. He’s a fanatic 
and his ideas are dangerous. This 
kind of experiment needs close con- 
trol.” Someone in a carnival mask 
blew a paper streamer into our 
faces. Delicias pushed it aside im- 
patiently. “Take my advice. Get 
out now.” 

“Thanks for the advice. The 
principle’s sound. How about the 
method?” 

“There’s a way,” she said. 
“Worked for me. Might work for 
you.” 

“You’d better tell me fast. This 
dance is damn’ nearly through.” 
“It’s crude but fairly effective.” 
“Go ahead. Tell me.” 

“You want me to tele — ” 

“Like hell. I’ve had enough of 
that. You stay in your skin. I’ll stay 
in mine. Talk.” 

So Delicias told me. 

It was a while — maybe four or 
five days — before I found an oppor- 
tunity to try her idea. 

I t was the winter vacation. Most 
of the students had gone home 
again after the New Year’s Ball or 
were on holiday trips. Cernik and I 
didn’t have real homes — just guar- 
dians for parents. Often we stayed 
around the campus with the other 
constructs or plain dedicates using 
the facilities. 



Cernik had gotten wary of push- 
ing me too hard. He still worked 
away at his obsession. I had the 
feeling he was biding his time, 
waiting for the right moment to 
push me over the brink into the big 
one. I kept on shielding from him, 
even more careful now that I had a 
break-away to try. 

I was working in the microfiche 
library one late afternoon when the 
librarian came down and said there 
was a call for me. 

I took it on her phone. The caller 
was Cernik. 

“Alan,” he said. “I’m ready to 
move into a new area. How are you 
fixed?” 

“I’m busy,” I said, feeling my 
heart rate rise. I kept the visual 
button on cutout. “Why in hell are 
you using the phone anyway? I’ll be 
down in my pad in an hour. Look 
in.” 

“I’m up at Calella. I’ve been up 
here two days.” 

Calella was a mountain camp be- 
longing to the university. The place 
held full research facilities and 
computer terminals linked to the 
main complex at the university. It 
was usually overburdened with 
bookings for special projects, but 
probably not during holidays. A 
student was only supposed to go up 
there with a professor. I wondered 
how Cernik had made it. 

“What are you doing up there, 
learning to ski?” 

“I’m ready to move into a new 
phase. I told you.”

“Grigor, I told j;ow. I won’t go on 
that exchange try. It’s strictly 
no-go, negative, bust.” 

“It isn’t that. We’re not quite 
ready for that, Alan. Help me with 
this one. I’m sure I’m ready to go.” 

“What is it?” 

“Are you all right?” he asked. 
"You sound peculiar. Cut in the 
screen.” 

I was having to keep my hand 
shielding the microphone. My heart 
was pounding and I was scared it 
would put up my respiration rate 
and give me away. 

“I’m okay,” I lied. “I just don’t 
want a long conversation. I’m in 
the middle of research. Are you go- 
ing to tell me what your new phase 
is? If not, I’m off back to the 
microfiche.” 

“Visuals,” he said. “Quite 
simply. Visuals. I want to see if you 
can see out of my eyes. I can see out 
of yours.” 

I took a deep breath, tried to 
make the exhation sound like the 
sigh of someone whose primary aim 
is to get back to more absorbing 
work. 

“What do you say?” insisted the 
troll in the snowy woods, seventeen 
miles away. 

“Okay,” I said. 

“Marvelous! I took a chance 
coming up here. I know you haven’t 
seen this place — or have you?” 

“No.” 

“So anything you see will be cate- 
gory one proof.” 

“Right,” I said. “Count on me.” 



“What time will I teletrans?” 

I took another deep slug of air. I 
needed it. 

“Oh, think me around twenty- 
one hundred.” 

“Fine. Be with you, Alan.” 

“So long,” I said. 

The line blanked. I went back to 
the microfiche, but gave up work- 
ing after ten chaotic minutes. 

I was nervous. I thought about 
calling Delicias for a recap but 
abandoned it. I was on my own 
with my mad friend now. I packed 
my notes and recordings, went out 
to the town and bought a bottle of 
bourbon in a liquor store and 
came back and waited. 

I had an hour and forty minutes 
before Cernik called. Consider- 
ing there was that amount of time, 
I didn’t drink much of the bour- 
bon. Cernik called right on the 
hour. 

I had grown used to the sensation 
of a tight band around the inside of 
my skull. This evening the whisky 
was creating a new one outside. I 
shut my eyes in case Cernik had any 
smart ideas about looking out of 
them right away and saw the slight 
haze around the furniture and the 
bourbon bottle. 

Alan. 

Grigor. 

You made it right on time. The 
thought poured back and forth 
much faster than speech, faster 
than you read these words. 

Alan, let's settle down. Let's do a 



MINDHUNT 



55 




softwave routine. 

Cernik’s softwave routine was 
any one from a series of prear- 
ranged formulae. He chose. 

Six- oh, I told him. 

Good. 

He started another one. He was 
in the middle of it when I heard a 
shout of laughter. It was mine. 
Grig — you mixed it. You trans- 
mitted — and I gave him a salacious 
version of R 2 . 

The hell I did! 

Try again. What’s wrong with 
you? 

Nothing's wrong with me. Calm 
down! Calm down! Here we go. 

I hit him hard with this one. I 
put the block in the circuit as soon 
as he got started. I turned the 
preset message inside out. I made 
the words fall apart into letters and 
dance obscurely. I bounced them 
back into his head and made them 
reel around taking off their clothes, 
shouting drunkenly. 

Alan — for crissake! Cernik’s con- 
trol was iron. He kicked the mis- 
chief and his gnome face came bor- 
ing into the surface of my brain. He 
was angry, baffled. My God! 
There's something in the circuit. 
Are you okay, Alan? 

I'm fine, I said. I giggled and 
with my eyes still shut clutched the 
bourbon and poured a hot swig of 
laughter down my throat. I'm fine, 
man. 

You're not, damn it! Something' s 
wrong or someone else is plugged 
in. Let’s break. 



Okay, I said. But I wouldn’t let 
him go. I hung on to him. 
Thoughts threw up on the lawns of 
his mind. Words were thick and 
slow. I felt him cursing, tearing 
himself free. I let a couple of goat 
thoughts rut rudely on the broad 
prairies of Cernik’s Experiment. I 
had them foul up his perception 
with their idiot pleasure. You're off 
balance, Grigor, I hurled him. 
You're falling! You're falling over. 

He broke suddenly and smoothly 
and I was left sitting on the floor, 
feeling sober and ashamed and 
wondering what the hell would 
happen now. 

After a couple of minutes I 
pulled myself together. I hid the 
bourbon, washed the glass, aero- 
soled the room, sneaked down to 
the showers and sobered up under a 
long drench of cold water. 

Cernik had only the oldest kind 
of skimmer, but he covered the 
seventeen miles from Calella in 
around twenty-five minutes. To say 
he came storming into my pad 
would have misrepresented him. 
Can you imagine a cold, utterly 
silent whirlwind with exo-spectacles 
and a wedge-shaped head? 

“Something was wrong,” he ac- 
cused. His eyes behind the lenses 
held an insect’s unblinking stare. 
“It was at this end. I felt it.” I 
noticed a bruise developing on his 
forehead. 

I was lying flat on my bed. I 
could still feel the indigestible tide 
of bourbon lurking in back of my 



56 



GALAXY 




Ill 



throat but I had it licked. 

“Sure something went wrong,” I 
agreed. “You’ve been working too 
hard, G rigor. The storage systems 
have gotten overheated. The output 
valves scrambled and you tele- 
transed me absurdities. You ought 
to give it a rest.” 

I don’t think he even heard. He 
squeaked, “You’ve ruined a vital 
experiment, Durain! You’ve put us 
back a month!” 

I shrugged. “Knock it off, Grig. 
Go get some sleep. Two days soli- 
tary up at Calella have made you 
flip." 

“Listen,” he hissed (I could hear 
that first night of Kalipaj ranting 
away somewhere behind the venom 
in his throat). “Listen, Alan. We’ve 
got to go on. We need to do visuals. 
Next chance we get. I’ll find some 
other place ...” 

He went on like this for about 
half an hour, restoring those rolling 
plains of consciousness my Delicias- 
inspired break-away had polluted 
with cunning and split with earth- 
quake. 

It was all wind in the grass. Next 
day he was notified that he would 
be called before a disciplinary tri- 
bunal for breaking the rule govern- 
ing utilization of the Calella facil- 
ity. By the fifteenth of January the 
room next to mine was occupied by 
a bowlegged Mexican girl who was 
a student of the nervous system. 
Cernik was kicked out for indiscip- 
line. They marked him down a 
social bracket and out of my life. 



C ernik wasn’t an easy man to 
forget. But life and work rolled 
on and after a while days piled up 
on top of his memory like a cairn of 
stones. Every time I thought about 
him or awoke recalling his scouting 
the fringe of a dream, I wondered if 
he was trying to break back. He 
never came. 

For several weeks after he left 
university I daily expected him to 
try. He didn’t. He was probably 
embittered by the Calella experi- 
ence. Maybe he thought I had been 
the one who told the university 
authorities about his breaking se- 
curity. The cairn of days stayed si- 
lent. The passionate elf-ghost had 
abandoned it. 

The elite class dissolved and went 
on to individual achievements. I 
transferred successfully to the Mid- 
west Commemorative Research 
Center for two years to study the 
bio-chemistry of the brain. 

I had a generous professor 
named Phil Strickes. At the end of 
the two years he took me with him 
onto a small research team at Ohio 
Tech to explore cause and effect of 
activity in a silent area of the 
frontal lobes. Later a certain 
famous argument succeeded in 
identifying it for posterity as 
Strickes’ Zone. 

I was still at Ohio when the activ- 
ities of a team of astronauts began 
to capture the news. 

They were backed by a vast pro- 



MINDHUNT 



57 




gram of international cooperation 
and encouraged by the development 
of a variation of Telemaun’s Move. 
Telemaun’s Move had promised for 
a long time to exploit and convert 
to fact the fanciful but impractical 
theories of spacewarp. 

After secret trials they warped an 
unmanned probe to Aldebaran. 
They recovered it, too. The way be- 
gan to open for manned missions 
within the suns and planets of the 
galaxy. 

Between the preceding sensation 
and the current the astronauts held 
prime spots in all newscasts. Soon 
their faces became familiar in all 
our homes as they emerged in man- 
nikin reality from the tri-di screens. 
One of them was already familiar to 
me. Older certainly, rid of the mon- 
strous exo-spectacles in favor of 
contacts, his head even more dis- 
proportionate to his shrunken 
frame, the neck wounds concealed 
by the smart high collars of the 
spaceteam uniform. 

It was Cernik, grown, if possible, 
more restless, enthusiastic, pierc- 
ingly earnest than he had been as a 
freshman. After his banishment 
from the university he had volun- 
teered for space frontier work and 
his wedge-shaped head and shrill 
eyes had levered and burned his 
way to deputy command of this ex- 
perimental corps. 

I was painfully conscious of him 
during the next months. The ex- 
ploits of the Target Team (this was 
the popular name for them) were 



often the leading news. They creat- 
ed the same kind of public interest 
as the earliest space voyagers to the 
moon and Mars had done in the 
twentieth century. Cernik was often 
identifiable in spite of various dis- 
guises in deep space outfits, warp- 
ing here, rocket driven there, smil- 
ing into the inquisitive cameras on 
fleet recovery vessels, as purposeful 
and relentless as ever. 

Another year and more went by 
with Cernik lurking on the borders 
of my life. From time to time the 
wedge-headed troll would jog into 
my consciousness — never deliber- 
ately as he had used to do, but on a 
new wave of public interest. 

I felt well insulated from him. 
My own work on brain chemistry 
was absorbing and I had my own 
kind of success and reward. Less 
spectacular than Cernik’s, but 
tangible enough. Now and then I 
had a perverse desire to think an 
old call signal and see whether the 
magic would turn in its six-year 
grave. Prudence always saved me 
from that final indiscretion. The 
circuits stayed shut. The Experi- 
ment had been a freshman’s game, 
not for revival. 

T hen on a crackling spring 
morning when the world out- 
side the laboratory window looked 
innocent enough to be trusted, 
Strickes called me from my work. 
Strickes never called anyone from 
his work except in an emergency 
and I hurried along to the teaching 



58 



GALAXY 




unit where I knew he would be. 

From there, discouragingly, the 
world looked less innocent. 
Strickes’ office, adjoining the 
teaching unit, was cramped and 
looked out on a sunless corner of 
the lawn and the crematorium. A 
colorless, ghostlike shimmer of 
smoke rose from the stack above it, 
shadowing the air. 

I watched it as Strickes said, 
“Alan, only heaven knows what 
reason I have been asked to release 
you immediately to the Heights. 
Special duties. You are to travel im- 
mediately. There’s a warrant wait- 
ing for you to collect it at Adminis- 
tration. You go down to Houston 
on the stratorocket. Show the war- 
rant. Report to Major Sompting.” 

“But, Phil— I— why?” 

“I don’t know why. I’ve just re- 
peated to you everything I know 
and the orders I received. I don’t 
question the Heights. Neither do 
you.” 

“I don’t know anything about 
space,” I said weakly, but while 
Strickes had been talking some- 
thing had jolted in my memory — 
something like insomnia that twist- 
ed and wouldn’t lie still. “Don’t 
they think my work here is valu- 
able?” 

Strickes turned away and be- 
came absorbed with the papers on 
his desk. I knew there was nothing 
there of great importance. Strickes 
would have been summoned from a 
lecture to receive the request to re- 
lieve me of my duties here. There 



was nothing he needed at his desk. 
He said, “Why don’t you just go 
without argument, Alan? It won’t 
make any difference in the end. I 
hope we’ll see you again soon.” 

I went to Houston. It had kept its 
supremacy as an administration 
center since the beginning of space 
travel. People in the business called 
it The Hole in the Sky. For me it 
was a hole in the head. I felt the 
omniscient presence of Cernik the 
astro-gnome. 

Everyone was expecting me — 
men, machines, everyone. Major 
Sompting’s office was underground 
on the southwest corner of the com- 
plex. When the elevator stopped 
the lights said Flight Planning. I 
didn’t believe it. It was crawling 
with security, human and mechani- 
cal. I didn’t believe what happened 
when I fed my ID fiche to the com- 
puter and it let me into Major 
Sompting’s office. Major Sompting 
was Delicias Disch. 

It was like walking quickly back- 
ward across your life. Delicias grin- 
ned. Her flax-colored hair was 
shorter to keep it off the major’s 
tabs on her collar, but she was still 
the same sympathetic, warm and 
loving person. Then I understood 
why my memory had jolted whep 
Strickes told me about the sum- 
mons. Sompting was the name of 
the engineering student Delicias 
had tied up with at the university. 
They must have married afterward. 

“Hello, Alan.” Her hand was as 
warm as ever. “Wonderful to have 



MINDHUNT 



59 




you with us. It’s been a long time.” 
“For heaven’s sake, Delicias! 
When is anyone going to tell me 
what this is about? Are you going to 
tell me? Have me with you. Who’s 
you?” 

“Us now includes you.” Then 
she told me. 

She had always been good at 
briefing. We didn’t waste many 
words. 

T arget had run into difficulties 
that didn’t get the publicity 
accorded to their more spectacular 
exploits. 

There were communication prob- 
lems. Serious ones. Evidently pho- 
tophone tracks got bent under the 
Telemaun Move and ordinary radio 
beams took months to relay a signal 
to the galaxy and achieve a re- 
sponse. 

“Somebody had a bright idea,” 
said Delicias. Warmly and kindly 
she smiled. Her trim bottom show- 
ed in the tight skyblue uniform 
pants as she paced the office. “Pro- 
Commander Cernik. You remem- 
ber Cernik?” 

It was just a kind way of letting 
his name into the conversation 
without provoking panic. Remem- 
ber Cernik? Who was going to for- 
get him? 

“Who could forget him!’’ I 
echoed aloud. 

“Good. He sent a recommenda- 
tion to Heights that Space A and A 
should set up an investigating unit 
to explore the possibility of tele- 



pathic communication to supercede 
mechanical systems.” 

“No,” I said. Maybe I even got 
up out of my chair. I don’t 
remember clearly. Maybe Delicias 
pushed me back gently. Yes. I 
remember her perfume — a neat, 
unfussy perfume like wet, cut 
grass. 

“No.” I repeated. “No.” 

“Listen, Alan. Just listen, won’t 

I watched her walk away from 
me, toward me, away from me, 
toward me — skyblue bottom, ever- 
kind face, skyblue bottom, ever- 
lovely face. She talked. 

“I don’t know whether you re- 
member that I moved over to psy- 
chopathology when I left Norfolk. 
Then I got into hypnosis and psy- 
chomanipulation. Gerry — my hus- 
band, Gerry Sompting — was draft- 
ed into the engineering corps on 
Target when Target was still known 
by a computer code number in 
Space A and A and nobody knew 
whether it would go or where. 

“When Cernik got his idea Gerry 
and I talked it over and I put up 
some thoughts of my own to my 
professor. To keep it brief, we had 
some further conferences with 
brasshats and think-tank bureau- 
crats at Heights. They asked me to 
formulate a research program on 
Cernik’s teletrans idea. They gave 
me this pretty uniform and a pla- 
toon of go-go men, women and ma- 
chines. 

“I need about six subjects who 



60 



GALAXY 




have proven ability in the tech- 
nique. I thought of you at once. 
The six are to match our six front 
astronauts in Target. So here you 
are.” 

“I won’t do it, Delicias.” I told 
her. “Sorry to give you the trouble 
of bringing me here, but I want to 
get on with my own research. I 
finished with that old party game 
five years ago. I won’t have that 
crazy gnome stitched to my mind 
and I don’t want any link with his. 
You’ve got a nonvolunteer.” 

“It’s not as easy as that, Alan. 
Heights are sold on this now. 
They’re throwing an avalanche of 
resources behind it. The guardians 
have given the nod. Cernik is big 
medicine. He put up your name. 
Mine, too. I’m sorry. You’re draft- 
ed. It’ll be easy. Everything will be 
under strict control.” 

It was easy — easy for them. 
Everything was under strict control. 
Including me. They didn’t let me 
leave Houston. The avalanche of re- 
sources rumbled down. Everything 
a VIP prisoner needed from a 
toothbrush to female companion- 
ship materialized out of the un- 
limited bank accounts of Heights. 

I was continuing that rearward 
march over my life. Once again I 
found myself part of an elite, cos- 
seted, coaxed, urged to greater en- 
deavors. We were four men two 
women, each of us with some extra- 
ordinary sense less blunt than in 
millions of our fellows, being train- 
ed to tune it to communication 



across uncountable distances. 

We worked. The psychomanips 
worked on us. On the route toward 
ultimate sophistication I recrossed 
the territory of my student days. I 
developed concentration, thought 
codes, felt the tightening of the in- 
visible band around my forehead, 
learned not to reject the alien pres- 
ence in my mind, the intrusion of 
others into the last human refuge. 

I didn’t look forward to the inevi- 
table encounter with Cernik. When 
it happened it was quickly into 
sinister low key. 

I didn’t expect him to be sur- 
prised. For one thing, I knew he 
had suggested my name. So he 
would expect to see me. 

I anticipated , some carefully 
planned argument to swamp with 
enthusiasm any reluctance I might 
still feel, but he had changed. 

He was brisk and the mental 
energy still crackled away, but it 
was channeled now; concentrated 
like a laser beam. 

“Glad to have you with us, Du- 

* M 

rain. 

Everyone in Target was glad to 
have everyone else with them. It 
was like a password. Every time I 
sat down at the teaching machine I 
expected the headset to tighten its 
embrace and the false mechanical 
voice to tell me: Glad to have you 
with us. 

We talked about the project. 
Cernik paced up and down. Every- 
body on Target paced up and 
down. Cernik said, “I don't know 



MINDHUNT 



61 




how far Sompting has developed 
the thinking, but it seems to me ex- 
tremely important that we proceed 
toward not only communication, 
but control. As Target develops 
and we move into a full exploratory 
field we shall be sure to encounter 
situations where restraint and con- 
trol exercised from home may be 
needed to retrieve situations of 
grave risk.” 

“That is reducing the distant in- 
dividual to the level of a machine,” 
I said. “In which case there is little 
point in flying manned missions.” 

“Not so, Durain. The first 
essential is communication. Mind 
can’t communicate with a ma- 
chine — but only with another mind. 
Control might well be the only life- 
line if local conditions or emer- 
gencies place the distant individual 
and his crew and maybe — ultimate- 
ly — his passengers and cargo at 
hazard." 

“And what if the reverse hap- 
pens, Grigor? Suppose the local 
risk, emergency or hazard is fed 
back from outlet to control?” 

He stopped pacing and stared at 
me. Although he had discarded the 
old-fashioned spectacles he hadn’t 
yet disciplined his reactions to es- 
cape the nervous push toward the 
bridge of his nose. 

“I hope you aren’t going to let 
your idealistic absolutism betray 
this experiment, too. What you 
suggest is possible but unlikely. If 
the distant mind is thrown into a 
state of confusion it will hardly be 



able to reverse the teletrans con- 
trol — ” 

“What do you mean ‘betray’?” I 
said in a voice that was slightly 
weaker than I would have liked. 

“I mean Norfolk,” said Cernik 
coolly. “Target might have been 
five years ahead right now if you 
hadn’t brought everything down at 
Norfolk.” 

“You can blame yourself for 
that. The Experiment stopped be- 
cause you got caught using Ca- 
lella.” It was a half-truth, but 
valid. “In any case, you can’t claim 
that about Target since you 
couldn’t have been contemplating 
it then and nobody knew about the 
communication problems it would 
throw out.” 

“You wanted to bust it and you 
busted it,” said Grigor informative- 
ly. “I don’t know how. I just hope 
you don’t have any similar deser- 
tion in mind here. It could end in 
disaster.” 

“I wouldn’t be here if I had any 
doubts,” I lied. 

Cernik’s smile was intended to 
defrost the ice on his face, but it 
merely served to underline its pres- 
ence. “Okay, Durain. That’s the 
past anyway. We’re not going to 
quarrel about it. Let’s think about 
what progress we made and what 
we’re going to do now.” 

We thought about that and dis- 
cussed it. We talked about the old 
days, too, now that we had shoved 
the collapsing skeletons uneasily 
back into their cupboards. In spite 



62 



GALAXY 




of the new entente, there remained 
this low-key feeling. “Betrayal” 
was the word he had used. It was an 
emotive word. I began to get the 
feeling that Cernik probably hadn’t 
forgiven me for Norfolk and cer- 
tainly hadn’t finished punishing me 
for it. 

T he research went on at full 
speed, but always controlled, 
always carefully monitored. We 
studied, we trained, we concentrat- 
ed. Our diets were watched. Ma- 
chines produced careful programs 
for our mental activities, our phy- 
sical fitness, our love lives. (They 
didn’t have much bother with 
mine). We sat at teaching machines 
and in front of lecture screens. We 
passed tests. We paced up and 
down. We were all glad to be with 
one another. 

After about six months, Delicias 
Sompting pressed the go switch on 
the first trial. Whether for reasons 
of diplomacy or because the ma- 
chine so ordained neither Cernik 
nor I participated direclty. Trans- 
mitter (base) and receiver (distant) 
were respectively at Houston and in 
one of the Space A and A Earth 
orbiters. Messages passed. They 
were simple messages, but the relay 
was exact. The President sent con- 
gratulations. Major Delicias Somp- 
ting was promoted Pro-Colonel. 

From simple teletrans Target 
moved to readback of flight data 
and ground control instructions. 
Now everyone was in it. They 



spread the distance first to the 
moon, then to Mars, then to an 
elliptical round trip out of Solar 
and back. It all worked. Trans- 
mission was instant. The Mars trial 
met fierce electrical storms and the 
ERT flew a meteor shower. Nothing 
made a difference. Teletrans had 
ceased to be research. It was now a 
development program. 

All the control subjects were 
matched with a ship commander. I 
was matched with Cernik. Who 
else? All the things we did were 
easy because we’d done them 
before and now everything was 
sharper. Delicias’ team, men, 
women and machines, had sharp- 
ened the fine telepathic sense in me 
and made me an instrument. Some- 
times the tuning was so fine I felt 
the feather-lightness of Cernik ’s 
flight helmet and sensed the wink- 
ing lights on the inflight computer 
console. 

Cernik wanted to bypass the first 
minor tests when it was our turn. 
The explorer end of Target already 
had a mission planned to Sector 
Five of the galaxy and Cernik was 
anxious to go ahead with it and 
skip the elementary trials. 

Control said no. They say that 
the irate little elf almost material- 
ized out of the tri-di arena in his 
rage. Cernik was an important man 
in Target. He knew the vice-admin- 
istrator on Mars. He could get 
through to the group controller at 
Space Aand A. But it didn’t make 
any difference. We had to observe 



MINDHUNT 



63 




the program. And we did. 

He won one concession. We did 
the orbiter test and a near-space 
test in one day. They and the ones 
that followed were a complete suc- 
cess. The machine said we were 
fine — nothing to worry about. 

Cernik came through on the 
tri-di after the moon test. His 
wedge-shaped head and keen eyes 
radiated satisfaction. “We got a 
nine alpha on that, Alan. Nine al- 
pha! Brilliant!” 

“I feel exhausted,” I said. Nine 
alpha was a maximum rating. You 
couldn’t get better. “We went too 
long.” 

“The hell we went too long,” 
squeaked Cernik. “Listen, you and 
I are going to be the first to operate 
on a real Target mission. Don’t say 
you’re going to flake out on me now 
as you did at Calella.” 

“Don’t worry, Grigor. I’ll see you 
out and back safely.” His intellec- 
tual bullying hadn’t been able to re- 
sist slipping in the reproach about 
Calella. I tried to transmit to him a 
quick twinge of the neuralgia that 
was skipping between my right 
optic nerve and the center of my 
head, but he had shut down. 

“Keep in training,” he said 
dryly. “The machine says we’re the 
best. No problems.” 

IV 

S omeone the machine did have 
a problem with was me. It 
couldn’t understand why I didn’t 



have a lovelife. It kept racking its 
circular brains for a solution. I was 
embarrassed because I guessed 
Delicias and some of her lieute- 
nants were seeing the reports. 

“Why don’t you punch me out of 
that section of the program,” I 
appealed to her one day. “Please?” 

“Sorry, I can’t do it. You’d 
figure every day on an exception 
report. The director doesn’t like ex- 
ception reports.” 

So our tireless electronic slave 
went on scouring Earth and the 
colonized parts of Solar on my be- 
half, looking for a mate. 

What relevance had this, you ask 
impatiently, to Target and Cernik? 
Why in hell go paddling up this 
backwater? Be of good cheer. 
Everything was relevant in that 
most relevant of all possible worlds 
at Houston. 

Delicias called me out of a rest 
period one afternoon. 

“Come on up to the residence,” 
she said. “There’s someone I want 
you to meet.” 

I went up under mild protest. 
Rest periods were short and infre- 
quent on the Target Project. 

Delicias was sharing her comfor- 
table lounge with a girl of about 
nineteen or twenty. 

“Meet Klara,” she invited. 
“She’s joining the psychomanip 
team. Klara’s been working at the 
Martian unit.” 

Klara gave me a limp hand. She 
was plain and flat-chested and 
looked undernourished. She had 



64 



GALAXY 




messy lip rouge and atrocious eye- 
brows and her smile was lopsided, 
but I sensed she had a powerful lot 
of brain linked to the inside of her 
apple-green eyes. 

I was a bit mystified about why I 
had the privilege of a private intro- 
duction to someone who was clearly 
going to be a junior member of 
some Target ancillary squad. If I’d 
been brighter I would have guessed. 

“Klara’s going to take on your 
intensive tp-sense buildup attune- 
ment pre-expedition,” Delicias told 
me in computer jargon. “You’ll be 
seeing a lot of one another in the 
next couple of weeks.” 

“Fine,” I said to be polite. “Glad 
to have you — glad to have you 
around, Klara.” 

She didn’t say anything. She just 
grinned her nutty grin and stared at 
me out of those eyes. I had a queer 
feeling in my belly. Like I was al- 
ready asleep and safe in someone’s 
hand. 

That was the start of it. I still 
don’t really know whether Klara 
had any real psychomanip expertise 
or whether they’d given her a crash 
course as an excuse, but within a 
couple of days we were making the 
machine happy. Those eyes had 
plumbed whatever constructional 
fault the gene architects had com- 
mitted in me and set about rectify- 
ing it. 

I had a lot of time to make up 
and I went at it with a determination 
that matched Cernik’s student fer- 
vor. Klara demonstrated she was 



no slouch, too. She worked at our 
joint private project with vigor and 
invention. We made love here, 
there and any place that was rea- 
sonably private round Space A and 
A. Our nights were wild and wake- 
ful. In our days there were but two 
things to think about and the other 
one was the coming Target expedi- 
tion. 

Somewhat wearily, I suspect, the 
computer began to file me on ex- 
ception. In quite a different way 
from the expected. The director 
didn’t like exception reports. A tiny 
hint of disaster scuttled about in all 
the positive sunshine. But everyone 
was too busy to notice until it got 
through to Cernik. 

We were doing a readout when it 
happened. A readout was about as 
near to Cernik’s old “visuals” 
mania as the Teletrans Communi- 
cation project could get. It was an 
instant scan of the instrumental 
data on the main flight console. 
Eyeball to eyeball — space to Earth. 
It was a pointless exercise while the 
spacecraft was within metering dis- 
tance of Earth-control computers. 
It gained significance at warp entry 
and beyond where conventional 
metering got snarled in the new 
communication problems. 

What happened was, I fell 
asleep. It could only have been an 
instant. I was aware of what had 
happened as soon as I became con- 
scious again, but Cernik was howl- 
ing down the photophone immedi- 
ately. 




‘‘Control! Control! We blanked. 
What the hell happened? Alan? 
What the bloody hell? You cut out 
on me.” 

“Hold it. Hold it, Pro-Comman- 
der,” Control soothed him. “Hey, 
Alan, we monitored a two-second 
blank on the readout. Did you 
read?” 

“Sorry, Control,” I mumbled. “I 
lost alert. I missed concentration.” 

“Are you okay, Alan? Do you 
need a break?” 

“No. I’m fine.” Goddam! We’d 
done the thing five times and Cer- 
nik was only just next door in lunar 
orbit. “No, I’m fine. Let’s roll 
again.” 

Control set it up again. Over the 
headset I heard Klara’s milky voice 
tell me. “Compose, Alan. Okay?” 

“Okay.’’ I composed. Cernik 
had stopped swearing audibly. He 
glared around in my mind instead. 

You bumf You aren’t going to 
flunk on me again, he thought. 

I played disdainful. I thought 
him the start symbol. Ready to 
read. I daren’t close my eyes. 

We still stayed Nine Alpha. I was 
very careful after that. The ma- 
chine looked at the incident and 
passed it as the point zero one error 
margin allowable. 

Cernik didn’t pass it. I sensed 
him brooding over it, notwith- 
standing his heavy program on the 
moon for the Sector Five mission. I 
managed to keep my incredible new 
lovelife rolling and my record 
clean. The machine was happy. 



about three weeks to lift-off 
Klara got sick. Getting sick on 
a project at Space A and A wasn’t 
actually a crime, but all the re- 
actions to it suggested that it might 
be. 

All she had was a mild throat 
infection, but they hauled her off 
into total quarantine, pumped her 
full of antibiotics and started a ma- 
chine trace of how and where she 
might have picked up the bug. The 
trace was so ruthless that it would 
have made the Inquisition seem 
like a kindergarten party. 

I don’t remember whether they 
got anywhere with it. The direct 
result of the mishap was that I got a 
Chinese psychomanip as a stand-in 
for Klara. He had a beard and a 
limp. My lovelife dove from Nine 
Alpha to Omega Minus and, as the 
days wore by with Klara sealed in 
her glass aquarium like a captive 
passionfish and me trying to cheer 
her up through the glass in my brief 
rest periods, I started to develop a 
twitch. Decidedly nervy. 

With all the assistance of my 
Chinese handler I still found it pro- 
gressively more difficult to concen- 
trate. My mind turned more and 
more often to Klara. Apart from 
her influence as a psychomanip 
there were other more tangible 
things she had for me. Hidden ad- 
vantages which, behind an anti- 
septic screen and a bullet-proof 
wall of glass, were all too firmly 
hidden. 

I guessed it wouldn’t be too long 



66 



GALAXY 




before my galloping melancholia 
strayed over into my work. I saw 
the pitfall digging itself and tried to 
go into reverse. I pleaded with De- 
licias to take me off the Teletrans 
Communication project until Klara 
recovered. No dice. I was vital now. 
Cernik needed me. If I pulled out, 
Target would have to switch to 
Team Two. The shot would be de- 
layed and the nuclear punch fuel 
that was already cooking would 
have to be cooled and rehashed. Et 
cetera. In short, the whole damn’ 
project would go phut. They’d just 
have to take a chance on my going 
phut instead. 

I didn’t disappoint them. “Who 
the hell ws that?” yelled Cernik. He 
was in a flight simulator on moon. 
Target was trying to construct sim- 
ulated minus-warp, warp, warp- 
plus conditions while we teletrans- 
ed. A nonsense. When you go 
through warp it’s a different time 
layer. “Who was that?” raged Cer- 
nik. “Stop the test! Stop the god- 
dam test!” I felt a prickle of cold 
sweat on my forehead. I knew I had 
sent him the face of the person 
who — these days — was constantly 
on my mind. 

They called off the afternoon 
tests. Cernik refused to participate. 

1 tried to get through to him on a 
radio link but they said he was busy 
and he wouldn’t talk to me. 

There was an inquest at Space A 
and A. The machine. Colonel De- 
licias, the Director, and my limping 
Chinese mindbender put their 



heads and circuits together. They 
talked to me and tested me, did an 
eeg and then ran a comparison on 
the machine to see whether anyone 
else could take my place. There was 
no one. 

It was late evening before I was 
released and could make my way to 
the quarantine unit to wave to 
Klara through the glass. But the 
aquarium was empty. 

I burst into the nursing unit. 
“What’s happened to Klara?” I 
asked the startled nursing sister. 

“Oh, she’s been drafted. Out of 
Space A and A and back to the 
Martian unit after convalescence..” 
“On whose instructions?” 

“Mr. Durain,” she said severely 
with astringent douches and hypo- 
dermic needles in her voice, “cer- 
tainly not on mine. The orders 
came straight from the director.” 
She must have telephoned Deli- 
cias and reported my strange be- 
havior because Delicias tried to 
stop my going to the director, but I 
wasn’t in the mood. 

When I marched past the guards 
and into his suite with Delicias still 
pleading behind me one of the faces 
that looked up from around the 
table was only too familiar. It was 
Cernik. His eyes were like hot gray 
ashes. 

“Klara!’’ I shouted. “What’s 
happened to Klara?” 

“Alan, this has gone far enough.” 
“Who sent Klara back to the 
Martian unit?” I glared from one 
to the other. 



MINDHUNT

Suddenly, with that acute tuning 
of minds in which we had been 
trained, I knew that Cernik was re- 
puted to have influence with the ad- 
ministrator of the colony. 

“We can’t have the run inter- 
fered with, son,” said the director. 
“We didn’t realize your programed 
mate would have this effect on you. 
We’ll recall her as soon as Tar- 
get—” 

“Grigor,” I said. “Get her back. 
You did this. You had them recall 
her. Now get her back or you don’t 
fly to Sector Five. Not with me as 
control.” 

“Alan — ” pleaded Delicias. 

“That’s contrary to regulations,” 
growled the director. “Do you 
realize what you’re saying?” 

“You can’t let this bust the whole 
program.” Cernik was standing 
right in front of me. “While she 
was here she was an obsession. The 
controls need absolute concentra- 
tion. Twice, recently, Alan, you’ve 
lost me. Twice! Think of what 
could happen if you did that while I 
was in hazard and maybe there was 
something urgent to send or re- 
ceive — or maybe you had to take 
control. You’d be responsible for 
the ship and the crew — ” 

“I want Klara back,” I said stub- 
bornly. 

“We’ll put in a recall as soon as 
the mission’s flown,” Delicias 
promised. 

“Listen to this, Alan.” The 
director fiddled with a tape ma- 
chine on his desk. 



The machine used all the wea- 
pons it could against me. Out of it 
came my lover’s voice. Flat, lop- 
sided, persuasive. 

“Darling, when you hear this I’ll 
be halfway back to the colony. I’ve 
thought about everything and 
what’s been happening to you and 
I’ve listened to all they’ve told me at 
Space A and A. It truly is going to 
be better and safer and more logi- 
cal .. .” 

There was lots more like that. 
Logical crap that they’d sold her for 
my benefit. And it ended: “. so 
I love you and I long for you and I 
look forward to having you again in 
a short time when the mission’s 
safely over.” 

And it was ironic and bitter as 
hell because before she had even 
finished speaking to me, bodiless, 
ghostlike, reduced to tape in a ma- 
chine in that room at Houston she 
was dead. 

The Colony Clipper was twenty- 
eight thousand miles downrange 
when a meteorite holed it. There 
were no survivors. 



T hey kept it from me well. I sup- 
pose they were trying to make 
up their minds about what to do on 
Target. 

In the end they told me. Klara 
had been dead three days. They’d 
made up their minds by then that, 
because of my irrational behavior 
after the redrafting of Klara and a 
certain animus I appeared to ex- 



68 



GALAXY 




hibit toward Pro-Commander Cer- 
nik, I was a bad risk. A worse risk 
now, because they predicted I 
wouldn’t behave logically in a set of 
unfavorable circumstances. Unfav- 
orable circumstances! 

So they dropped the countdown 
and inhibited the fuel and rephased 
(he whole program and told me 
about Klara and handed me over to 
the psychomanips and the dream 
merchants and forgot about me. It 
was a nuisance, but that’s life at 
Space A and A. 

But I didn’t forget about them. It 
was just small consolation to me 
that Cernik had to be stood down 
and didn’t fly that first mission and 
so missed the glory. 

That compensation was inade- 
quate for my busted career and my 
lost love drifting weightless as a 
cinder out in the big darkness. 

Through all the rehabilitation 
and the dreams of idyllic country- 
side and dusky girls with eyes like 
gazelles and breasts like lemons 
they gave me, I stalked Cernik. 

Forget, they urged me, looking 
at my boiling mind. Look at this. 
Relive that. You are a construct. 
We made you. Now we will rear- 
range the genetic bricks a little in 
pursuit of happiness. You are a 
new Alan Durain . 

I smiled blandly, nodding, play- 
ing with my model spacecraft, 
sitting cross-legged in front of the 
tri-di set watching the news bulle- 
tins for Cernik to cross my sights. 
Not saying much, eating honey- 



crunch, I carefully concealed my- 
self in the thickets of Strickes’ 
Zone. Waiting. 

Two or three or more years went 
snailwise across my life. The Target 
mission returned from Sector Five 
with its astounding Christopher Co- 
lumbus stories of habitable planets. 
An exploration fleet was organized 
for a return and, once again, 
Grigor Cernik was headlines. 

COMMANDER CERNIK WILL BE 
THE FIRST HUMAN TO SET FOOT ON 

a body outside solar, roared the 
newscasts. The wedge-shaped head 
and passionate eyes stared out and 
down at us all again from the ma- 
chine. Grigor Cernik was to at- 
tempt a solo landing on one of the 
planets of the New New World. 

My dreams became restless. The 
psychomanips shook their heads 
sadly. They offered me maps of 
exotic places alive with majestic 
scenery and delightful scents and 
happy people. I only looked at the 
star maps, calculating where Cer- 
nik would cross. 

Sometimes a colonel in the sky- 
blue uniform of Space A and A 
came to see me. She was a woman. 
She was not Klara. She always 
came alone. She talked about “old 
times.’’ What are “old” times? All 
time is time. It is neither old nor 
new. It is time. 

“Now this,” said the eminent 
stellar cartographer glowing on the 
screen, “is an electronically simu- 
lated map of the route to be trav- 
eled by the astronauts of Frontiers- 




man, when they begin their long 
journey next week.” 

It was an ingenious map. I ab- 
sorbed it and let it go on existing in 
my mind. 

Every instant of Frontiersman 
shimmered in three dimensions in 
our homes. Mine was still shared 
with several other turbulent lives 
and the patient faces of the psycho- 
manipulators who hadn’t given up 
hope for me. 

Soon the three depot ships of the 
expedition were in deep space and 
then into warp. After that there 
were no pictures from them — the 
cameras had to be content with pic- 
tures from Houston and the Mars 
relay. 

Sooner or later they showed the 
lives of the teletrans controllers. 
Cernik’s Control was a woman 
now, a brawny wench with coppery 
red hair. I thought her — on and 
off — quick as a flash. She was 
thinking about a movie actor and 
she had pain from an ingrowing 
toenail. I was in and out so fast she 
didn’t notice. That was fine. It was 
going to be easy. I licked the honey- 
crunch stickiness from my fingers 
and watched the arena in front of 
the tri-di. 

T he depot ship Mermaid went 
into orbit around the chosen 
planet early one morning. I didn’t 
want to skip breakfast and have the 
psychomanips asking themselves 
questions, so I went down and pre- 
tended I wanted to help in the kit- 



chen and I had early breakfast 
there. 

Cernik’s cutter blasted free at a 
little after nine o’clock Earth time. 
Still no pictures, of course, but he 
was doing an instantaneous com- 
mentary through his control. The 
cameras depicted her face from 
every angle. 

I didn’t want to watch the pic- 
tures. I went up to my room. I was 
switching on-off, on-off all the 
time. Quick as lightning. I breath- 
ed the false air of the space cutter’s 
cabin, smelled the heating metal as 
Cernik skidded on the atmospheric 
layer, broke it and went through. 

I am forty thousand meters 
above surface. Atmosphere indi- 
cates nontoxic gaseous content. 
Thin gaseous cloud. Metering on. 
All systems go. Conventional 
cameras go now. 

I lay on my bed in my pad at 
Norfolk. I blanked and locked into 
her mind. Cernik’s mind. 

Thirty thousand. 1 have surface 
in view now. Surface in view now on 
monitor ! Around 8/10 cloud. 
Eight/ten. 

I thought him the old lock-in 
symbol, felt him jar. 

The redhead laid it back, trying 
to eliminate interference. I bounced 
a visual of Klara’s face off her mind 
into his. 

Hold. Control, cried Cernik. 
Hold! There’s a block. 

I revved up. I gave him the goats 
to gallop in and out of his instru- 
ments and kick the readings 



70 



GALAXY 




around. I took over the redhead 
and scrambled the emergency sig- 
nals. 

Emergency! Emergency! He tried 
to cut and hand it back to the depot 
ship which could assume mechani- 
cal control, but I hung on to him. 

Switch to auto, someone was 
sending. Switch to computer, pilot. 
They were trying to take his red- 
head out. 

You re falling Cernik, I thought. 
Cabin is minus three-G. 

The bump as he floated up to the 
cockpit shell almost knocked me 
off my bed. I was laughing. I took 
off the redhead’s clothes and made 
her dance around among the naked 
words and scrambled symbols in 
his lolling head. 

The cutter was already off course 
when they fired the retroactors by 
remote control from the Mermaid. 
Too bad he was already pointing 
the wrong way. 

I whistled down with him. The 
altimeter zoomed zeroward like a 
shell. I cut just before they impact- 
ed. I wanted to hold on to him a 
bit. He shouted something. 

A while afterward the Skyblue 
Colonel came to tell me things. 
“Just before it happened he called 
your name, Alan. Just your name. I 
think he wanted you to step in and 
save him. It was a tragedy.” 

“Have some honeycrunch,” I 
said. I offered her the box. 

“Grigor,” she said, taking both 
my hands and looking into my eyes, 
“your old friend. You know — 



Grigor Cernik.” I closed my eyes. I 
knew about her. I knew her powers, 
too. She wasn’t going to see inside 
where I had something precious 
hidden. “They sent down a salvage 
party. They found the cutter. They 
couldn’t find Grigor. A tragedy. I 
thought you’d want to know, Alan. 
Alan!” 

Evaluate and comment on Har- 
rington-J eans’ contact micro-laser 
brain surgery as it bears on perso- 
nality change — ,1 commented so- 
berly. I picked up my model space- 
cutter and sent it arching noisily 
into the corner of my room. It was 
empty. No Cernik in there. 

The Skyblue Colonel went away 
sadly. She may not come back. 

I hardly leave my bed now. 

Night after night the horrified 
face of Cernik penetrates my 
dreams. 

Nothing the psychomanips give 
me deters him. He is trying to es- 
cape. Of course I haven’t told them 
who is the intruder in my dreams. 
They might want to experiment. 
After all, Cernik might well have 
told them that one of us could die, 
both of us could go on living. And 
he still has a lot of dying to do. I 
have a lot of living to live. Revenge 
is not a word I have used anywhere 
in this account. 

Like he said, the whole thing is 
relative. Matter and antimatter, 
writing in a mirror, the other side 
of the sky. I. Cernik. 

Glad (as they say) to have you 
with me. *

S elders set the scouter down 
near a rocky outcropping at the 
edge of the broad inland plateau. 
The forest below was a smooth- 
limbed stand of branching ivory 
stalks extravagantly draped and 
woven with silken veils — scarlet, 
saffron, aquamarine, violet. The 
setting sun fingered laterally 
through the diaphanous veiling, 
underlighting it. Selders stepped 
from the scouter, sucked a quick 
breath — light, dry, faintly sweet — 



75 



and unberthed the hoverscooter. 
He tested local gravity. It was 
pleasantly light. Scouter alarm set, 
necessary gear transferred to the 
smaller craft, he lofted and 
skimmed planet-west along the 
plateau wall. He raised glasses and 
scanned the dusky air above the 
forest. It was empty. 

Deliberately Selders dropped 
down the wall of the plateau and 
arched across ivory stalks hundreds 
of meters tall. Within minutes his 
canopy alarm buzzed. He peered 
around. A single skyveil approach- 
ed high from his right. Mansize, 
the insect propelled itself across the 
sky in uneven surges on incon- 
gruously fragile wings. Its black 
carapace was dull, its compound 
eyes like mirror-studded tumors. 
Nearing, the insect abruptly skirled 
brilliantly patterned scarlet skirts 
from secondary wing cases and 
skimmed down at the hoverscooter, 
spitting a swath of filmy white sub- 
stance. 

Selders’ throat closed in instinc- 
tive panic. He dropped the craft 
and scooted sideways, evading the 
arthropod’s entrapping film. The 
stuff floated impotently down 
through the air. The insect whipped 
scarlet skirts and surged after the 
craft again. Selders initiated a ver- 
tical climb, then darted sideways 
toward the plateau wall and topped 
it. 

The insect did not pursue. It 
hung in the air on billowing skirts, 
compound eyes breaking late after- 



noon sunlight into glittery shards. 
Selders set course directly across 
the plateau. When he glanced back 
the insect held point at plateau’s 
edge. 

Some kilometers later stalk forest 
gave way to badlands. Selders 
drifted down to bob across its 
rubbled surface. Then, beyond the 
badlands, the sun suddenly flared 
rose-dusky through the focusing 
lens of a single large dome. 

When Selders set down at the 
Pan Humanoid outpost a welcom- 
ing party materialized immediately, 
at its fore a big, bear-shouldered 
man in his thirties, curly brown 
hair tumbling down over a high 
forehead. 

“Director Brown?” Selders gues- 
sed. 

Brown bared big white teeth. “I 
am. Trouble with your primary ve- 
hicle, Commander — ” 

“Captain, Federation Protective 
Authority.” 

“ — or are we meeting an im- 
promptu inspection?” A flick of the 
wrist opened the facility to Selders’ 
pleasure. 

Selders shook his head. “Neither. 
There’s a lot of naked stalk forest 
north and east of here. Have you 
noted any particular pattern to the 
trader activity involved?” 

Brown’s rounded forehead com- 
pressed. “Trader activity? What 
does this world have of commercial 
value?” 

“Veiling extruded by the pre- 
dominant insect species is being 



76 



GALAXY 




gathered by freelance traders and 
distributed through a half-dozen 
major exotica dealers. It’s appear- 
ed on markets all over this sector of 
the federation. And you haven’t 
been aware of activity in the 
forests?” 

Brown’s smile was deprecating. 
‘‘The Pan Humanoid effort is 
focused entirely upon the humanoid 
form that occupies this plain, Cap- 
tain. The badlands beyond are the 
habitat of a particularly unpleasant 
carnivorous form we call the rock- 
wolf. I don’t permit members of my 
party to venture up that way for any 
reason. So we’re effectively buffered 
from the forests. But is it illegal to 
gather veiling for commercial pur- 
poses? If it’s done in moderation 
and without disturbing the in- 
sects?” 

‘‘No. But the Authority isn’t con- 
vinced it’s being handled so ethi- 
cally. Neither am I. I observed sub- 
stantial stretches of stripped and 
depopulated forest on descent this 
afternoon.” 

“Well, you’re welcome to scan 
our files on the toilers, our human- 
oid subject species. You’ll find a 
few observations on rockwolf be- 
havior. None, I’m afraid, on the 
skyveils. We simply have no knowl- 
edge of their habits — or interest in 
them.” 

“I'll study your files. Assuming I 
can draw meal privileges and a 
berth for the night.” 

Brown bared big white teeth. 
“Certainly.” 



O ver the evening meal Selders 
' sifted first impressions of the 
Pan Humanoid party. It consisted 
of Brown, his second in command, 
Farelli, and a dozen assorted fledg- 
eling specialists, all eager to discuss 
their efforts to facilitate advance- 
ment of the toiler species. The 
species was presently hampered by 
its entrenched custom of setting out 
substantial numbers of young to 
appease the appetites of night- 
prowling rockwolves. 

“And you’re convinced this isn’t 
a measure for keeping down excess 
population?” Selders probed. 

“No chance,” Farelli responded 
positively. He was an intense young 
man with lank black hair and ex- 
pressive hands. ‘‘This plain 
stretches for hundreds of kilometers 
west of here and there’s more on 
the other side of the forests. Most 
of it unoccupied. Plenty of seed and 
forage, too. The toiler population 
could multiply a thousandfold com- 
fortably. Instead they’re barely 
holding their own. And that’s with 
every fit female bearing up to twice 
a year.” 

“Hmmm. And the offspring they 
abandon are in no way defective?” 
Brown fielded the question. 
“They are literally the most fit, 
Captain. Can you imagine it? This 
race sacrifices ninety per cent of its 
young to appease a prowling carni- 
vore. Out of fear. Out of ignorance. 
And this is the only factor that is 
holding the race back. Once we 
overcome this — ”

Selders shifted restlessly under 
Brown’s evangelical zeal. “But you 
are successfully starving out some 
of the wolves now?” 

Brown leaned forward earnestly. 
“We are. We aren’t permitted to 
use weapons, force, or even chemi- 
cal repellents. Protective Authority 
ties our hands in a hundred ways. 
But it is certainly within guidelines 
to persuade one species to discon- 
tinue being easy prey for another.” 

“It’s within guidelines,” Selders 
agreed tersely. But someone, he felt 
certain, was guilty of violation in 
the matter of the forests. His glance 
flickered over the party. Every 
member, according to Pan Human- 
oid files, was amply credentialed. It 
seemed likely to Selders that those 
credentials were fraudulent in at 
least one case. 

But Selders caught no dissonance 
as the party moved from meal to 
conference table. A quarter-hour 
later the evening’s resume was in- 
terrupted by a screeching cry that 
rose threadily beyond the dome, 
ending in a high-pitched gargle. 
Selders’ head whipped around. 

“Rockwolf!” The party scram- 
bled to the night-darkened panels 
of the dome. Outside the screech 
rose again. Selders quivered invol- 
untarily. Brown’s ingenuous eyes 
were suddenly fierce. “That’s what 
we’re up against, Captain — that 
animal.” 

The animal’s voice split night 
again, rending it like rotten cloth, 
then dying with a choked yelp. 



And a second voice joined it, 
shrilling, high and distinct. Brown’s 
big palm slapped dome. Then he 
was running out. 

Selders heeled after him, the re- 
mainder of the party following. 
“The western quadrant,” Brown 
shouted back. “And we’re com- 
pletely powerless. There’s nothing 
we can do — unless we can bully the 
mother into pulling the child back 
into the burrow.” 

They raced across hummocked 
ground, the night sky starless over- 
head. Minutes later Brown halted 
abruptly, penciling darkness with 
his handlamp. The animal he cap- 
tured in the beam was ugly, low- 
slung, with lumpy jowls that de- 
pended from a broad, flat head. It 
glared into the light, one eye blood- 
red, the other yellow. It hunched on 
sturdy forequarters, its coarse pelt 
ruffled. 

B rown stamped his feet, uttering 
an inarticulate cry. The animal 
was not intimidated. It sprang from 
the beam of light. With a loping 
trot, it moved across the hummock- 
ed ground. 

Another shrilling cry — and a 
second beam of light spotlighted a 
tiny humanoid stranded in the dirt 
before a plastered mud mound. 
Selders had a brief glimpse of a 
minute body with flipper-short 
arms and a round little head. Then 
Brown slapped the beam away. 

But the rockwolf had already 
seen. It sprang across the mounded 



78 



GALAXY 




terrain. The burrow mouth behind 
the child was tightly plugged with 
straw. Squealing with fright, the in- 
fant toppled to its side, rolled to its 
belly and squirmed in a futile effort 
to escape. Its shrill cry shivered the 
night. 

Brown bellowed and began to 
slap feet to ground fiercely. Behind 
him the party danced and shouted, 
voices harsh. The rockwolf wheeled 
and glared at them. Then it 
lowered its broad head and slowly 
stalked a half-circle around the 
struggling youngster. It faced the 
humans again from beyond the 
child, red eye and yellow burning 
by lamplight, ugly body hunched. 

Selders swallowed painfully. Per- 
fectly formed body, round head, fat 
little limbs, minute fingers and 
toes ... he could comfortably con- 
tain the infant in the palm of his 
hand. Instead the same hand 
closed helplessly around the grip of 
his pistol. Every rule in the book 
forbade intervention. 

Abruptly, with a yelp, the rock- 
wolf lunged, catching the infant’s 
neck in its jaws. The child’s cry 
died in mid-note. The wolf shook 
the limp body. Again red eye and 
yellow defied the helpless humans. 
Then the animal trotted away with 
its prey. 

“Powerless,” Brown grated. “Be- 
cause if we blast that animal — ” 

Selders’ stomach hung limp and 
sour. “Me or someone like me will 
pull you right off this planet. You’ll 
never wangle your way back.” 



Selders’ hand released the pistol 
grip and fisted at his side. 

“That’s right, Captain,” Brown 
said bitterly. “If we commit vio- 
lence, we won’t be permitted to 
render the greater good. So we’re 
well motivated to observe Authority 
guidelines. Did you know that in 
four years we’ve had to lift only one 
man off before his tour expired. 
Medical reasons. He tried to save 
one of these infants.” 

“He was mauled?” 

“No. The animal snatched the 
child right out of his arms. He’s 
been under psych treatment for 
seven months now. Could be they’ll 
eventually salvage him. Right, 
Captain?” 

Selders’ shoulders tightened. “I 
don’t set the guidelines.” Neither, 
he was tempted to add, did anyone 
back at Authority Central. Nature 
set them. The Authority was charg- 
ed only with enforcing non-inter- 
ference. 

Brown flashed his beam back at 
the plugged burrow. “We’ll talk to 
the mother tomorrow. We’ll prob- 
ably find the bones out here some- 
where later in the week.” Snapping 
off the lamp, he strode into dark- 
ness. 

N ext morning Selders appre- 
ciated why Pan Humanoid had 
dubbed the subject species toilers. 
When he and Brown ventured 
across the hummocked plain, the 
little humanoids scuttled busily. 
They were thigh-high to Selders, 



SKYVEIL

their heads like grapefruit on thin, 
loose-fleshed necks. Some carried 
sheafs of grass and wild grain. 
Others industriously swept loose 
dirt with bound straw or patted 
their burrow mouths with dampen- 
ed palms. When Brown passed, 
they piped at him, bobbing round 
heads, black eyes winking brightly. 
Brown returned their incomprehen- 
sibilities distractedly. 

“Are these family burrows, Di- 
rector?” 

“They’re shared by mother and 
young. Adult males, the few there 
are, sleep along the corridors that 
connect to the communal gran- 
aries.” 

“Oh? There’s an imbalance of 
sexes?” 

Brown’s face was grim. “Not at 
birth. But a mother seldom aban- 
dons a daughter unless she’s been 
replaced by another. She’s likely to 
set out a son as soon as another 
pregnancy is established.” 

When they reached the area of 
the previous night’s kill, a small 
body dodged hastily into the bur- 
row. Brown’s lips thinned. He mo- 
tioned Selders to sit beside him in 
the dirt. “Waiting for Alo,” he an- 
nounced in a falsetto voice. “Wait- 
ing to talk.” 

Round eyes peered at them from 
the interior of the burrow. “Alo,” a 
small voice piped. 

“Waiting to talk,” Brown re- 
peated, lowering his voice. “Wait- 
ing to hear why Alo put her Dalo 
out to the wolf.” 



Alo’s smooth round head emerg- 
ed from the burrow. She had 
neither ears nor nose, only a rose- 
bud mouth and bright black eyes. 
“Rockwolf called. Alo put Dalo,” 
she offered placatingly. 

“Rockwolf called other nights. 
Alo did not put out Dalo.” 

Warily the little creature emerg- 
ed, her tiny body bent. Loose flesh 
layered her neck and arms. She 
spat into the palm of one hand and 
patted at the burrow mouth. 
“Rockwolf called. Big hungry 
voice. Dalo time.” 

Strain harshened Brown’s fea- 
tures. “But why last night, Alo? 
Why not keep Dalo? Now Alo has 
no child in her burrow.” 

Alo’s bald head bobbed ner- 
vously. “No Dalo.” She patted her 
lower belly. “Other child instead. 
Malo? Zalo? Talo?” 

Brown’s jaw tightened. “I know 
Alo expects another child. That’s 
why I have talked to Alo so much 
lately. But what if Malo-Zalo dies 
in belly? What if Malo-Zalo gets 
sick on first milk and chokes? Then 
no child at all, Alo.” 

Alo’s black eyes winked. “No 
child,” she agreed. 

Selders cleared his throat. “Alo,” 
he said experimentally, “did you 
want Dalo’s food for the second 
child?”. 

The little humanoid peered at 
him alertly. “Dalo? Se-con-dalo 
child?” 

“Number two child,” he tried 
again, hoisting two fingers.

GALAXY 




“Dalo was her fifth,” Brown in- 
terrupted. “Her fifth in three 
years.” 

Selders grunted. ‘‘Then did you 
think, Alo, that you would not have 
enough food for Malo-Zalo if you 
kept Dalo?” 

Alo’s rosebud mouth pursed. 
“Food all around.” 

“Then — why? Why did you let 
rockwolf kill Dalo?” 

“Rockwolf called. Big — ” 

“ — hungry voice,” Brown finish- 
ed for her bitterly. “Keep rockwolf 
happy, right, Alo? Plenty of babies. 
Always make more. What’s a little 
blood?” The big man jumped up. 
“Never mind that your entire race 
lives out here on thirty square kilo- 
meters of land. Never mind that 
you’ll never pull yourselves out of 
the dirt unless you start raising 
your young. Never mind anything 
but big hungry voice!’’ Brown 
turned abruptly and strode away. 

The little humanoid looked after 
him, bright-eyed. “Alo,” she piped 
at Selders and then scurried back 
into her burrow. 

II 

44 ttow long do you intend to 
XI devote to this mission, Di- 
rector?” Selders asked, catching up 
with the big man. 

“As long as it takes. I’ll die here 
if I have to. I’ll die pulling these 
people out of the mud and starting 
them down the track to develop- 
ment. They have the potential. You 



heard her speech, Selders. You saw 
those opposed thumbs. You — ” 
“What I don’t see are many 
young,’’ Selders broke in. “I 
thought your files indicated sub- 
stantial success in this western sec- 
tor of the burrowing area.” 

Brown’s eyes whipped away. 
“Yes. We’ve concentrated our ef- 
fort here with the idea of establish- 
ing a seed population that will im- 
pose the new cultural pattern over 
the entire burrowing plain. And 
we’ve had considerable success.” 
Selders indicated the busy popu- 
lation at their feet. “Then where 
are the surviving young? Do they 
keep to the burrows?” 

Brown jammed a hand back 
through his hair. “They keep 
dying, Captain. There’s an endemic 
cysting disorder. Sixty to seventy 
per cent of the juveniles we bring 
through the first year reach puber- 
ty, which comes near the end of the 
second year, and — bang! Naturally 
the toilers have no established 
treatment. But I have requested a 
pair of surgeons. When — ” 

“Then it is defective offspring 
that are being sacrificed.” 

“No. There’s absolutely no sign 
of the disorder until shortly before 
death. No one can predict which 
youngsters will fall victim. All we 
can do is wait and watch — and once 
we have our surgeons, operate. It 
should be a fairly simple procedure, 
one the toilers can manage after 
we’ve brought them a little farther 
along.”

“How long is the life span in in- 
dividuals who do attain adult- 
hood?” 

Brown shrugged. “Up to twenty 
years.” 

“And you think such a brief span 
can support development?” 

“Look at what our own race ac- 
complished in the centuries before 
we attained our present longevity. 
And without outside assistance.” 
“True.” But Selders was not 
greatly impressed with Brown’s 
little people. And the toilers’ 
developmental tribulations were 
not, after all, relevant to his own 
purpose here. “I’ll be hopping out 
to one of the depopulated forest 
sectors this morning. Do you want 
to accompany me?” 

Brown’s brows flared in surprise. 
“Isn’t it extremely hazardous to in- 
vade skyveil territory?” 

“Not the depopulated areas. And 
you might like to be present to de- 
fend your interests. There is specu- 
lation at Authority Central that 
some member of your party is at 
least partially responsible for the 
forest situation. If I don’t find 
clear-cut evidence of outside inter- 
ference, I’ll have to turn in a rec- 
ommendation that your group’s 
authorization be rescinded.” 

Brown stared at him. “You — 
Captain, don’t you appreciate the 
significance of what we’re doing 
here?” 

“My job is to appreciate the sig- 
nificance of those stripped forests.” 
Turmoil darkened Brown’s eyes. 



“Then I’d better accompany you.” 

L ess than an hour later they 
j skirted the plateau eastward. 
In the distance big insects floated 
in the air on brilliant skirts. Below, 
sunlight fingered silk-draped 
bowers. 

“The material looks too fragile to 
have much commercial value,” 
Brown commented. 

“It’s not as flimsy as it looks.” 
Selders scanned the horizon with 
glasses. “And there’s the first area 
we’ll visit. Have a look?” 

Accepting glasses. Brown studied 
the denuded stalk forest ahead. 
“The lack of leaves is normal, of 
course — or is it?” 

“It is. The stalks transact most 
of their business through their 
outer peel.” 

They reached the area without 
incident. Selders sheered off the 
side of the plateau and hopped the 
tops of the stripped stalk forest. 
Sunlight shadow-patterned the 
ground hundreds of meters below. 
Occasional swaths of torn veiling 
clung to ivory stalks. Selders 
dropped the craft between the 
limbs of giant stalks. When they 
touched ground he rummaged 
through the hold, producing a pair 
of harnessed liftpacks. 

“Have you ever maneuvered in 
one of these?” 

Brown accepted the proffered 
pack reluctantly. “No, I’m afraid 
I’m not particularly adventure- 
some.” 



82 



GALAXY 




“Well, these will give us better 
mobility if we run into trouble. 
They’ll lift the weight right off our 
feet.’’ He stapped the second pack 
across his shoulders. “Use the 
second setting. We’ll be able to 
climb trees like a pair of monkeys — 
but without worry about acciden- 
tally taking altitude even in this 
light gravity. The packs aren’t that 
heavily powered.” He unreeled the 
handset and clipped it to his belt. 
With a quick pressure of fingers he 
lifted his weight from his feet and 
raced lightly across the soil surface. 

They explored the stripped por- 
tion of the forest quickly, finding 
nothing more significant than a 
single large casing that lay empty 
on the ground. It was spun of a 
silken substance and bore a jagged 
incision at its narrower end. 

Both men examined the bulky 
object. “A cocoon?” Brown sug- 
gested . 

“Looks like it.” 

They continued through the 
stripped forest, encountering 
neither live nor dead inhabitant. 
Then silken fairyland lay ahead. 
Sunlight glowed through elaborate- 
ly draped and interwoven hangings, 
scarlet, aquamarine, emerald, saf- 
fron. They paused. Selders assayed 
the quality of silence that haunted 
the veiled forest. “I don’t think this 
sector is populated either. But if 
you want to wait out here for me — ” 

“I’ll come.” The decision was 
obviously painful. 

“Then let’s take it slow. First 



setting.” He led away. The diapha- 
nous hangings the skyveils had 
extruded to shelter their habitat 
were draped and woven to create a 
series of rainbow bowers. Despite 
its fragile appearance, the veiling 
was tough and run-resistant. With 
the aid of their liftpacks, the two 
men scrambled up branching ivory 
stalks. Meters above ground, Sel- 
ders glanced back to see Brown 
grimly clinging to an ivory stalk. 
“Heights bother you?” 

The big man flushed. “I’m a 
land animal, Selders.” 

Selders flashed a reassuring grin. 
“Don’t worry. If you fall, flip to 
three. You’ll land easy. Just try not 
to entangle yourself on the way 
down.” 

D uring the next hour the two 
men explored lowly bowers and 
lofty ones, tightly woven ones and 
airy ones. Then, returning to 
ground level, they stepped into a 
lofty central space partitioned with 
violet hangings that fell hundreds 
of meters to the ground. Both men 
halted, sucking breath simultan- 
eously. The enclosed stalks were 
thickly hung with big fibrous pods. 
“Hundreds of them,” Selders 
breathed. 

Before he could climb to cut one 
down, Brown yelped. Selders spun. 
The big man backed away from a 
dusty black object on the ground. 

It was the carapace of a dead sky- 
veil. Selders bent over it. Man-size, 
undamaged, its sheen was dulled.

The black claws were folded stiffly 
before the thorax — the compound 
eyes were clouded. He shoved his 
hand into the shell. The organic 
contents had dried. When he 
opened the primary wingcases the 
fragile little wings crumbled to the 
ground. But the brilliantly pattern- 
ed parachute skirts remained at 
once tough and silken. “No deterio- 
ration. So there might be a market 
for this, too.” Which could account 
for the absence of insect corpses in 
the depopulated forest. 

Selders scrambled up to chop 
down one of the big pods. He 
trimmed back a flap and another 
dead arthropod lay before him. He 
plunged a hand into its shell. The 
contents crumbled at his touch. 
“Which tells us nothing. Except 
that we have no physical evidence 
of a massive kill — yet.” He gazed 
up at bulging layers of pods. 
Pulling small bags from his pocket, 
he took samples of dried tissue 
from the two insects. He labeled the 
bags. “We’ll stop by the scouter 
before we head back. I want to run 
a quick analysis on these tissues. 
And I want to recheck the records, 
too. I don’t recall that anyone has 
ever entered inhabited skyveil forest 
afoot, but I want to be certain 
before I undertake it.” 

Brown’s forehead creased appre- 
hensively. “Afoot? Wouldn’t that 
be—” 

“ — extremely hazardous? I don’t 
know. The veils defend their air- 
space, certainly, but they may not 



perceive an individual approaching 
afoot as a threat. What I do know is 
that this is a dead forest. It’s telling 
me nothing. Except that we’re 
dealing with an insect that pre- 
serves its dead. How much signifi- 
cance do you see in that?” 

“I have no frame of reference at 
all where insects are concerned, 
Captain. I actively dislike them.” 
Brown’s big shoulders hunched 
with painful decision. “But if you 
decide to enter the stalk forest on 
foot I will accompany you.” 

Selders grinned. “The supreme 
sacrifice.” Brown’s daring, it was 
apparent, would never be legend. 

It was late afternoon when they 
lofted from the scouter. Analysis of 
insect tissue revealed no trace of 
poison. And scan of the micro- 
records told Selders that no human 
had ever entered populated skyveil 
forest afoot. Selders studied 
Brown’s sweat-filmed face. “If your 
duties can’t accommodate two con- 
secutive days of neglect, why don’t 
you appoint a stand-in? Farelli 
maybe?” he suggested tactfully. 

“No. I won’t delegate anyone to 
undertake a venture of this nature.” 
“Suit yourself.” Selders set 
course into the late afternoon sun. 

after the evening meal, Selders 
2*V was restless. He strapped on 
his liftpack. “I’m taking an evening 
skim. Anyone care to accompany?” 
His volunteer was a scrappy little 
Oriental named, incongruously, 
Emmanuels. He mastered the lift-

pack easily — “I did a little packing 
on Nelding’s World — ” and the two 
of them skimmed through the 
night, handlamps picking hungrily 
at darkness. Beneath their boot toes 
toiler burrows were tightly plugged. 

Night slapped cool and welcome 
against Selders’ cheek. “Are you 
making the toilers your life’s 
work?” he probed. His jaunt was 
inspired partly by restlessness, 
partly by desire to give anyone who 
felt the need an opportunity to 
speak to him alone. 

“These little people?” Emman- 
uels flashed teeth derisively. “I’m a 
two-year man here. I plan to cover 
a dozen races before I take retire- 
ment.” 

“Some particular reason?” 

“Curiosity mostly. Maybe I’ll put 
together a comparative study. 
Counterpose intelligent humanoid 
races against, say, intelligent rep- 
tilians, aquatics, avians — you get 
the idea?” 

“Mmm. So it doesn’t sound like 
Pan Humanoid is your natural 
mother.” 

“Ha! Listen to Brown and you’ll 
think humanoids are the only life 
form worth studying. He restricts 
us to the plains area because the 
wolves are dangerous — he says. But 
I’ve walked right through the bad- 
lands on my off-duty days and 
never had a toe nipped. And I’ve 
learned something interesting — the 
veils prey on rockwolves.” 

Selders’ interest sharpened. 
“You’ve observed the activity?” 



“I have. Evidently the veils stung 
the animal first. I heard the com- 
motion from a distance. By the 
time I was near enough to see what 
was happening, the wolf was con- 
vulsing. The veils spat a white, 
stringy stuff to immobilize it. Then 
they cocooned it and carried it away 
into the forest.” 

“They didn’t react to your 
presence?” 

Emmanuels snorted. “I decorat- 
ed the underside of a boulder until 
they were gone. The way that 
cocoon was writhing — well, I didn’t 
spot the veils’ stingers, but I didn’t 
need a dose of what they injected 
the wolf with.” 

Selders grunted thoughtfully. He 
flashed light over Emmanuels’ 
night-shadowed face. “Have you 
ever observed trader activity in the 
forest area?” 

Emmanuels shook his head em- 
phatically. “The rockwolves are 
nocturnal, so I’ll walk their country 
by day. But I’m not trespassing on 
veil country night or day. There is 
something very disconcerting about 
an insect the size of a man.” 

Selders agreed. There was. 

Half an hour later they neared 
the boundary of Pan Humanoid’s 
focal area. At a distance they heard 
the screech of a wolf. Selders 
tensed. But the animal’s cry went 
unanswered. “I suppose the wolves 
concentrate now on the portions of 
the plain not covered by the Pan 
Humanoid effort?” 

Emmanuels touched his handset 



SKY VEIL 



85 




and settled upon a hummock. 
Selders took ground nearby. 

Emmanuels said, “You know. 
I’m not convinced they do. Some of 
us suspect the wolves are instinct- 
patterned to hunt only certain 
areas. The party had rough nights 
their first two mission years. After 
they first persuaded the toilers not 
to put out babies hungry wolves 
prowled the sector every night — all 
night. Ear plugs were the only thing 
that kept some people sane. Evi- 
dently the wolves were working cer- 
tain predetermined stalking areas — 
and finally they were literally 
starved to extinction.” 

But not total extinction. The dis- 
tant screech made that obvious. 

The answering shrill made it de- 
vastating. Selders’ spine quivered. 
Emmanuels jumped up from the 
hummock. “Sorry, Captain, but 
I’m not staying to listen for the 
kill.” He fingered the handset. His 
feet left ground. 

Selders followed. But their re- 
treat was not swift enough. A few 
minutes later they heard the 
abruptly truncated cry. For a mo- 
ment Selders empathized with 
Brown’s desperate determination. 
The air that slapped his cheek was 
no longer cool but chill. 

V 

T he air was still chill next morn- 
ing when Selders and Brown 
lofted from the Pan Humanoid out- 
post. “We’ll hover to within hiking 
distance of the stalk forest if the 
veils will tolerate air traffic that 



close to their territory. We’ll go 
afoot from there.” 

Brown’s glance was agonized. 
“Through wolf country?” 

“The wolves should be sleeping. 
There’s minimum danger.” He 
studied his companion. Was his the 
agitation of a guilty man or simply 
of a very apprehensive one? “What 
do you think we'll find in the 
forest?” he probed. 

“I — I hope we’ll find a reception 
no more hostile than you antici- 
pate.” 

But Selders was anticipating on 
several different levels, a fact he did 
not share yet with Brown. He took 
the hovercraft into the morning 
sun. 

They dropped in low over the 
badlands. With glasses, Selders 
could see skyveils floating in the 
morning-misted air, skirts billow- 
ing. None seemed disturbed by the 
approach of the hovercraft. Nor 
was there reaction at ground level. 
Selders found a level spot and set 
the scooter down. 

Brown emerged from the craft 
with patent reluctance and 
strapped on his liftpack. He de- 
murred when Selders proffered a 
belted pistol. “Captain, we’re not 
permitted to use weaponry against 
local forms under any circum- 
stance.” 

“Today you’re not only per- 
mitted but ordered if either of us is 
attacked. Necessary force is autho- 
rized in the interest of the greater 
good.” 



86 



GALAXY 




Brown echoed the last phrase 
numbly. He strapped on the pistol. 
“I — in case you haven’t perceived. 
Captain, I have a morbid fear of 
insects.” 

‘‘It shows — a little.” Selders led 
way across the badlands. 

The ground was rugged, boulder- 
strewn. Irregular clumps of vegeta- 
tion leached starveling existence 
from the rocky soil. There was no 
sign of rockwolf beyond an oc- 
casional slumbering body burrowed 
deep into rocky shelter. But twice 
they stumbled across bones. Selders 
poked the second skeleton with the 
barrel of his pistol. “Doesn’t look 
like he fell prey to his brothers. The 
bones would be scattered. So we 
have natural causes, possibly star- 
vation.” 

Brown’s eyes showed flint. “In 
that case, I hope I can claim per- 
sonal credit for the death.” 

Selders shrugged. “Claim it.” 

They were nearing the rainbow 
shadow of the stalk forest when 
they heard a curdling animal shriek 
behind. Selders whipped around. 
Automatically he fingered a liftoff. 

A hoarse warning from Brown 
brought him back to earth. A pair 
of skyveils emerged from the silken 
forest, surging through the air on 
incongruously fragile wings, gaudy 
skirts retracted. Selders tossed 
himself into the shadow of a boul- 
der. 

The big insects disappeared 
across the rubbled landscape. Sel- 
ders glanced back toward the 



forest, then skimmed again in the 
direction of the animal cry. 



II 

N ear a dip in the ground, a 
coarse-furred rockwolf thrash- 
ed wildly, teeth snapping. The sky- 
veils settled several meters away. 
Their multi-faceted eyes shattered 
morning sunlight. The larger strok- 
ed swelling pouches at the side of 
its head. Mandibles dropping, it 
spat a banner of filmy white sub- 
stance at the convulsing animal. 
The wolf s own frenzy entangled it 
firmly. Then the insects spat alter- 
nating layers of the sticky film, 
flipping the increasingly bulky 
bundle with black claws. 

Ten minutes later the rockwolf 
was a writhing silken cocoon. The 
two insects wove a ropy cradle 
around it and bore it back toward 
the veiled forest. 

Selders settled back on his heels, 
briefly considering the significance 
of what he had witnessed. Insect 
sting had not produced convulsions 
in the wolf, as Emmanuels had pre- 
pared him to expect. The con- 
vulsive state had clearly preceded 
the appearance of the veils. The 
wolf s cries, in fact, had guided 
them to the spot. Thoughtfully 
Selders skimmed back to where 
Brown waited. He related the inci- 
dent. “Do rockwolves commonly 
have mismatched eyes? One red, 
one yellow?” 



SKYVEIL 



87 




Brown palmed his sweaty fore- 
head. “Not to my knowledge.” 

“Then little Dalo’s killer has met 
his fate. Unless there was another 
wolf out here with unmatched 
eyes.” 

Brown stared at him dumbly. His 
mouth worked. 

But Selders did not have time to 
wet-nurse the big man through his 
reaction to the incident. “So let’s 
go. I want to see how the veils 
dispose of that cocoon.” 

Brown found his voice. “Maybe 
they simply encased the animal to 
preserve it. Like the insect we cut 
down yesterday.” 

“Under the violet hangings?” 
Selders shook his head. “Those 
were pods. This was a cocoon. 
Which certainly points to some in- 
teresting possibilities.” Possibilities 
he didn’t yet feel ready to put finger 
to. 

He led way. Beneath the flowing 
rainbow hangings of the forest, 
morning was a composition in 
pastel shadow. Selders glanced 
around watchfully. A single insect 
hopped ivory branches high above, 
extruding a length of chartreuse 
veiling and draping it down the 
limbs of the stalk. Brown touched 
Selder’s arm and nodded toward a 
bower of emerald veiling where a 
second skyveil sat grooming its 
wings. Neither arthropod gave sign 
that it noticed the human’s tres- 
pass. 

“I think we’re safe as long as we 
stick to the ground and move 



slowly. They don’t appear sophis- 
ticated enough to take interest in 
an object that isn’t clearly either 
food or enemy.” Now as to how the 
convulsing rockwolf fitted into the 
skyveil scheme of existence . 

The answer to that, he felt, 
would be of appreciable signifi- 
cance. 



T hey walked the forest silently, 
warily, pausing occasionally to 
watch the big insects extrude and 
weave their silken auroras. An hour 
later they emerged in an unob- 
structed central well of stalks. 
Selders peered up. 

Hundreds of meters above, upper 
limbs were hung with cumbersome 
white shapes. Selders slapped 
glasses to his eyes. Silken cocoons 
rocked slowly in the late morning 
sunlight. But one did more than 
rock. Slowly, tortuously, it writhed 
within its ropy cradle. 

“We’ve found our wolf.” With a 
quick stab of triumph, Selders 
passed the glasses to Brown. A 
single skyveil tended the cluster of 
cocoons, fanning them witti gaudy 
violet skirts. 

Brown stared up. When he low- 
ered the glasses, he gaped at 
Selders wordlessly. 

“Well? Do you begin to suspect 
that this is a hatchery?” Selders 
demanded. “And that we may have 
discovered an insect in wolfs cloth- 
ing?” 

Brown’s pale eyes were tortured. 



88 



GALAXY 




He didn’t answer. 

Selders continued his specula- 
tion: “If the veils were simply using 
the wolf as a hatching medium, a 
source of nourishment for their de- 
veloping young, they would have in- 
troduced ovum or larva. Either into 
the wolf or into the cocoon as they 
bound him. We didn’t see them do 
either. Maybe the wolf itself is the 
pupal form.” And the convulsions, 
it followed, had merely been a 
signal of readiness. 

Brown scaped up voice. “Of 
course. Something like that — it’s 
obvious. Even to — me. Now.” His 
feet took him backward. “And so 
we can return to the outpost. Now 
that we know — ” 

“Know what?” Selders demand- 
ed. 

“Now that we know — ” 

The recording was stuck. “What 
we know is that now I’ll have to 
climb those trees and cut into one 
of those cocoons, if mother-bug will 
let me. Because I didn’t come this 
far to spin an unsupported hy- 
pothesis.” Not even an unsupported 
hypothesis having so little apparent 
relation to his mission’s purpose. 
“How good are you with a pistol?” 
Brown shook his head. “Not 
very. I’m — I’m not normally a vio- 
lent man.” 

“Plan to be one today if neces- 
sary. Here — ” He slipped Brown’s 
pistol from its holster. “Let’s set 
the beam wide. Better you singe me 
than miss entirely if I run into 
trouble. I want you to keep this 



weapon in hand and I want you to 
have both eyes on the situation every 
moment. The greater good, right?” 

Brown licked his lips. “The 
greater good.” The pistol quivered 
in his grip. 

Selders’ liftpack assisted him up 
the lower stalk. He kept an alert eye 
on the single veil overhead. She 
seemed undisturbed by his slow 
approach. From fifty meters, he 
glanced down to be sure that he saw 
the pistol in Brown’s hand. 

He saw it. He saw, too, the 
ghastly grimness that deformed 
Brown’s features — a grimness rem- 
iniscent of Brown’s expression the 
night little Dalo had been snatched 
by the wolf. 

Snatched — killed? — in fact, by 
the wolf who hung twisting above. 

Facts — what were they? As Sel- 
ders picked his way limb to limb up 
the smooth white stalk some facts 
abruptly slid to rest in his mind, ar- 
ranging themselves in patterns he 
had not anticipated. It was not only 
what remained of the rockwolf that 
hung above. It was also — in some 
fashion — what remained of little 
Dalo. 

Little Dalo who, if he had sur- 
vived his first year, would almost 
certainly have fallen victim during 
his second to the cysting disorder 
endemic to his race. It was almost, 
in fact, as if little Dalo had never 
been intended to survive, as if he 
were one of nature’s disposables. If 
he had escaped consumption by 
outer force, inner force would have

inevitably destroyed him. 

But would have destroyed what? 
A humanoid infant? Or an unrea- 
lized . 

. skyveil? Selders’ breath 
caught in his throat. His head 
snapped back. He stared at the big 
insect above. It was not cysts that 
destroyed juvenile toilers, he realiz- 
ed in an intuitional flash. It was 
engorged and deteriorating cell 
masses that should, in the absence 
of human intervention, have ma- 
tured into the adult insect form. 
And that maturation somehow took 
place through the agency of ap- 
parent death at the fangs of the 
rockwolf. The rockwolf might — in 
some manner yet to be discovered — 
conceivably even be mate or mer- 
ger-partner to the consumed toiler, 
his stalking cry a mating call. 

So what existed on Selmarri was 
not three races, probably not even 
two, but one — toiler, the egg car- 
rier or larval form; rockwolf, the 
catalyst or mating form; and sky- 
veil, the imago. Or perhaps the 
rockwolf was a separate species 
preyed upon — how else could the 
sequence of events be interpreted — 
by toiler mothers who set out young 
to be devoured. 

Which of course explained the 
toiler’s lack of survival drive, ex- 
plained why Pan Humanoid had to 
badger mothers to raise their 
young. For the toilers were not a 
species, not even those who ma- 
tured to serve as breeder popula- 
tion. They were simply a form. 



and Brown? Selders stiffened. 
£ \ . Brown had directed the Pan 
Humanoid effort here from incep- 
tion. He claimed to know nothing 
of import about rockwolf or skyveil. 
But how could he have failed, given 
four years on a small world, to sense 
something of the relationship be- 
tween his toilers and the other two 
forms? 

How could he fail now? With the 
evidence suspended over his head? 
Selders was suddenly and painfully 
aware of his own exposed position 
halfway up the bare white stalk, 
skyveil above, Brown below. He 
twisted his head to peer down. 

Brown stared up at him with the 
desperate ferocity of a man who 
sees his life’s work threatened with 
obliteration. But that was only 
what Selders saw in the big man’s 
face. In his hand, muzzle pointed 
at Selders, was the pistol Selders 
had obligingly set on broad beam. 
And in his mind, Selders knew, was 
another Selders artifact — three 
ringing words: The greater good. 

Selders had only the big man’s 
innate cowardice to bank on. That 
unfortunately appeared to have 
been temporarily negated by pros- 
pect of the greater good. Selders 
glanced up again, then quickly 
spidered sideways, putting stalk be- 
tween himself and Brown. 

Brown’s mobility, unfortunately, 
was not as severely limited as Sel- 
ders’. When Selders glanced down 
again, the big man had already 
loped the distance necessary to 



90 



GALAXY 




train the pistol on him again. 
Desperately Selders peered around 
for prospects. 

He had a choice: vertical or hori- 
zontal. Down would only deliver 
him to Brown, while up would take 
him into skyveil range without de- 
livering him from Brown’s pistol. 
But horizontal? If he leaped 
branches to the next stalk tree and 
the one beyond, then Tarzaned 
blithely away on skeins of scarlet 
veiling, his trajectory would carry 
him to the shelter of high silken 
bowers. Assuming that Brown was 
too shaken and unpracticed to 
bring down a moving target. And 
assuming that a little bit of legen- 
dary Tarzan still lived in Selders’ 
arms. 

He caught a deep breath and 
poised himself for the resurrection. 
Nimbly he leaped and skipped 
stalks until he reached a point 
where a swath of scarlet veiling 
hung within reach. He tested it. It 
seemed securely anchored. He 
glanced down. Then, yodeling, he 
tossed himself across space, cling- 
ing to slippery silken fabric. 

Whether it was his vocalization 
that momentarily disconcerted 
Brown and simultaneously attract- 
ed the skyveil’s attention, Selders 
never knew. But as he skimmed be- 
tween stalktops, Brown’s pistol 
sagged impotently. Selders threw 
himself to safety in a tightly woven 
emerald bower. He bounced twice, 
then wriggled through the woven 
fabric and scrambled upward until 



he was concealed within a more 
casually draped indigo alcove. He 
crouched, clinging to the smooth 
stalk upon which the veiling was 
anchored. 

When he glanced up toward the 
treetops, little Dalo continued to 
writhe in his cocoon. But his guar- 
dian no longer fanned. She had re- 
tracted her violet skirts and hopped 
to direct her mirror-studded eyes 
downward. Selders craned, seeking 
Brown. 

Brown was no longer confined to 
the ground. He had set his liftpack 
high and he bobbed unevenly up a 
nearby stalk, one hand briefly 
grasping white branches, the other 
still closed around the pistol. 

Selders’ throat closed on his 
warning cry. He flared a quick 
glance up. Launching himself into 
the air so soon after Selders’ own 
flight, Brown had definitely assum- 
ed new significance in the skyveil’s 
eye. She held her fractured gaze on 
him, her black legs flexing. Then 
she uncased tiny wings and beat air 
from her perch downward. 

“Brown!” Selders bellowed. 

Brown’s head snapped back. He 
stared up at the approaching in- 
sect. His physical response was 
total. His jaw sagged. His legs 
slackened. His fingers loosened. 
The pistol fell and Brown followed, 
his liftpack cushioning his tumble 
to a slow downward float. 

Selders "Swung from shelter, 
furious incomprehensibilities piling 
up on his tongue. The big insect 



SKYVEIL 



91 




beat near the falling man and 
flared gaudy skirts. They hung in 
the air side by side, insect and man. 
Glittery compound eyes met 
agonized blue ones. 

And Selders was paralyzed. It 
wasn’t until he caught the motion 
of the insect’s mandibles that he 
obtained response from his own ac- 
tivator finger. His beam was set 
narrow. Raising the weapon, he 
burned a crisp-edged hole directly 
through the skyveil’s head. And 
then there were two bodies tum- 
bling. 

an hour later Selders and Brown 
lofted from the badlands. 
Brown still nursed his sprained 
hand under his armpit, his face 
stark and glistening. 

“So there was no kill,” Selders 
said. “No bug bomb, no violence of 
any kind. In fact, it was lack of vio- 
lence that depopulated those 
stretches of skyveil forest. As a 
couple of your people guessed, the 
rockwolf is instinct-patterned to 
stalk only certain areas of toiler 
plain. And when the mature skyveil 
hatches, he is patterned to claim a 
certain section of the forest as 
home. So when you effectively 
closed down hunting — merging or 
mating? — on a broad sector of 
toiler plain, you halted maturation 
of insects who would have popu- 
lated big stretches of forest. Evi- 
dently a freelance spotter noted the 
unguarded forests and commercial 
activity moved in. And now Pan 



Humanoid is moving out.” 

Brown hadn’t spoken since his 
fall. His voice was rocky. “If that — 
if that is what truly occurred — ” 
“You know it is — in the large at 
least. Details will have to wait study 
by experts. I think you guessed at 
some of it before today.” 

“But if it is, if I did, then the 
mature form doesn’t survive for 
more than a year, Selders. Two at 
most.” 

“Obviously. Otherwise the forests 
could never have been so quickly 
depopulated. Insects seldom enjoy 
long lifespans in final form.” 

“But if we can salvage the toilers, 
if we can get surgeons out here to 
operate, to remove the cysts — ” 
“The ova,” Selders corrected. Or 
the larval forms that fed on rock- 
wolf through the period of meta- 
morphosis. Only observation would 
clarify all the details of the repro- 
ductive cycle. 

“If we can bring a little toiler like 
Dalo through puberty into adult- 
hood, he will have a lifespan of up 
to twenty years. He’ll — the waste, 
Selders! To permit a humanoid 
form to deteriorate into an insect, 
to let twenty years of productive life 
be sacrificed for a year or two in the 
forest. To let speech be lost, to — ” 
“But the guidelines are clear. 
Brown. Pan Humanoid hasn’t been 
working with a humanoid species at 
all here. You’ve been interfering in 
the reproductive cycle of an insect 
species. Speech, manipulating 
hands — in this species they’re not

ends in themselves. They’re simply 
manifestations of a transitional 
form. Why they should occur I 
haven’t the faintest idea — it’ll be 
up to paleontologists to determine 
how this life form evolved. But it’s 
the mature form that determines 
the ultimate classification of the 
species.” 

Brown’s lips thinned. He glanced 
away bitterly. 

Selders took the scooter high. He 
did not immediately set course 
back toward the Pan Humanoid 
outpost. Instead he hung in the 
midday sun, his eyes seeking the in- 
terior of the veiled forest where 
pastel shadow lay silent and deep. 
At a distance skyveils floated the 
air on brilliant skirts. One year or 
two with sunlight hot and heavy on 
the carapace, with a gentle wind 
billowing the bold- patterned skirts. 
One year or two . 

. contrasted to twenty years 
scurrying in dark burrows, toiling? 

Brown’s forehead pulled tight. 
“Selders, have you no reverence for 
the human form? For your own 
kind?” 

Selders sighed. “Not much.” 

“Yet when it came to a choice be- 
tween the insect and me, it was the 
insect you sacrificed.” 

Selders’ gaze flickered from the 
floating skyveils. He met Brown’s 
eyes. “It was,” he agreed. “But 
only after hesitation, Brown. And 
only because I knew you would 
never sacrifice another little Dalo- 
Malo-Zalo to your narcissism.” ★

e of my rivals in the science- 
V-r writing field usually begins his 
columns with a personal anecdote. 
Although I avoid slavish imitation, 
success is always worth copying. 
Anyway, the idea behind this 
column came from Robert Heinlein 
and he ought to get credit for it. 

Mr. Heinlein and I were discuss- 
ing the perils of template stories — 
interconnected stories that together 
present a future history. As readers 
may have suspected, many future 
histories begin with stories that 
weren’t necessarily intended to fit 
together when they were written. 
Robert Heinlein’s box came with 
The Man Who Sold The Moon. He 
wanted the first flight to the moon 
to use a direct Earth-to-moon craft, 
not one assembled in orbit — but 
the story had to follow Blowups 
Happen in the future history. 

Unfortunately, in Blowups Hap- 



pen a capability for orbiting large 
payloads had been developed. 
“Aha,” I said. “I see your problem. 
If you can get a ship into orbit 
you’re halfway to the moon.” 

“No,” Bob said. “If you can get 
your ship into orbit, you’re halfway 
to anywhere .” 

He was very nearly right. 

S pace travel isn’t a matter of dis- 
tances — it’s a question of veloci- 
ties. Most space systems designs 
begin with rough-cut estimates of 
present and near-term predicted 
technological capabilities, and one 
of the best measures used in design 
analysis is called “delta vee.” This 
is engineer talk for a change in ve- 
locity and comes from the general 
mathematical symbol for change, 
the Greek letter delta or A . 
Delta vee, written A v, is the 



94 





total velocity change a ship can 
make. 

The nice part about delta vee is 
that for rough analysis it doesn’t 
matter how you expend your fuel. 
You can burn it all up at once or 
make a whole series of velocity 
changes — the sum of delta vee 
achieved will be the same. More- 
over, the total delta v can be calcu- 
lated from the Specific Impulse (a 
measure of efficiency) of the fuel 
used and the fraction of the total 
ship weight that’s made up of fuel. 
No other numbers are needed, not 
even total ship’s weight. Given the 
total delta v, you can determine 
what kind of missions the ship can 
perform. 

The other nice feature is that 
delta v requirements for any jour- 
ney in the solar system can be cal- 
culated from well known para- 
meters: mass of the sun, masses of 
the planets you’re leaving and 
going to and the distances of the 
planets from the sun. Many refine- 
ments are possible, but rough esti- 
mates of delta v requirements for 
any minimum-energy journey can 
be run off on a slide rule in no time. 

The least costly method of long- 
distance space travel involves trans- 
fer orbits, sometimes called Hoh- 
mann orbits after the German ar- 
chitect, Dr. Walter Hohmann, who 
first calculated the energy required 
to get from place to place in the 
solar system. Hohmann’s book, 
The Attainability of the Celestial 
Bodies, was published in the mid- 



thirties and was an important book 
indeed, because it showed that 
space travel really was possible with 
chemical rocket fuels. 

Unfortunately, as Willy Ley noted 
in Rockets And Space Travel, Hoh- 
mann’s book is nearly unreadable, 
combining Germanic scholarly 
thoroughness, a subject matter un- 
familiar to many, lots of mathe- 
matics and an unnervingly complex 
style. Despite these handicaps his 
work remains important and the 
transfer orbits he described are the 
only feasible methods of getting to 
other planets from Earth, using 
chemical rockets, (see page 99) 

In Hohmann orbits, the starting 
planet at go and the target planet 
at the time of journey’s end must be 
precisely opposite each other, with 
the sun between. Naturally, then, 
the trip begins when the target 
planet hasn’t yet reached opposi- 
tion — these journeys can start only 
at certain times. The ship departs 
on a trajectory that carries it into a 
highly elliptical orbit with one end 
of the ellipse just touching the orbit 
of the origin planet and the other 
touching the orbit of the target 
planet. 

The delta v required for Hoh- 
mann trips to various places is 
shown in Table One (pg. 97). In 
every case it is assumed that the 
starting point is not on Earth, but 
in orbit around Earth. The num- 
bers were calculated for me by Dan 
Alderson, who programs JPL’s 
computers and is usually concerned

with real spacecraft such as Pioneer 
and Mariner; they’re quite accu- 
rate, given the model used. For 
those interested, we assume the 
planets have circular orbits, all lie 
in the same plane and use conic 
section approximations. 

The first important number is 
the fly-by delta v requirement. This 
assumes you just want to get close 
to the target, and after that you 
don’t care what happens to the 
ship. In the real world fly-by probes 
can be useful afterward: the Pio- 
neer series Jupiter probes, for 
example, may round Jupiter in 
such a way that they use Jupiter’s 
attraction to fling them on toward 
other planets or out of the solar 
system altogether. 

There was even a possibility of a 
Grand Tour, in which the space- 
craft approached Jupiter and Sa- 
turn and then either flew past both 
Uranus and Neptune — or went di- 
rectly from Saturn to Pluto, each 
time using the delta v gained from a 
close approach to one planet to get 
to the next. Congress wouldn’t fund 
the Grand Tour and that oppor- 
tunity is lost for our lifetimes — it 
takes a special configuration of 
planets to make the Grand Tour 
possible. But as I write this the 
people are preparing to launch 
Mariner 10, a probe that will use 
Venus as a slingshot to send it 
down to Mercury. And if all goes 
well Mariner will arrive at Mercury 
about the time you are reading 
this — or right soon after. (Mariner 



is scheduled to arrive at Venus on 
Feb. 5, 1974, and at Mercury on 
March 29, 1974). 

T he Pioneer probes carry the 
famous gold plaque with a code 
showing the origin of the spacecraft 
and line drawings of human male 
and female, on the assumption that 
some day they may be picked up by 
beings in another star system. Since 
the probe will leave the solar system 
with a velocity of only a few kilo- 
meters per second and must cross 
trillions of kilometers before there’s 
any possibility of its being found we 
don’t have to worry much about the 
aliens using it to track us back to 
Earth and conquer us. By that 
time— if interstellar travel is pos- 
sible we’ll have it. 

It happens that I was present 
when that plaque — called “The 
Praque” by the TRW technicians 
who build Pioneer — came about. 
NASA held a big press briefing at 
TRW, a dog and pony show for 
science reporters. The NASA, JPL, 
and TRW scientists concerned with 
Pioneer described the experiments 
aboard and one happened to 
mention that Pioneer would defi- 
nitely leave the solar system forever. 

One of the reporters present was 
Eric Burgess who, with Arthur 
Clarke, founded the British Inter- 
planetary Society back in the 40s. 
Eric became very thoughtful, and 
later that afternoon spoke to Carl 
Sagan of Cornell and some of the 
others in charge of Pioneer, point-

Values for Sun are very close approach and circular orbit at surface. Value 
for Earth is marginal delta-v needed to escape Earth’s gravitational effect. 
Asteroid capture values are large because the asteroids have essentially 
no mass, and thus do not aid appreciably in an attempt to catch up with 
them after arriving at their orbital distance. 



ing out what a unique opportunity 
this was to send a message to any- 
one “out there.” It might take a 
long time to arrive, but at least it 
was going. The idea caught on and 
within a week the plaque was 
designed and installed. 

Then, of course, came the com- 
plaints about the “dirty pictures” 
of nude men and women, but that’s 
another story. 

Table One shows, in addition to 
fly-by delta v requirements, the 
delta v you’d need to get into some 
kind of orbit around the planet: 
the bare minimum for capture and 
a circular orbit from which you 



could land or observe closely. You 
can see the numbers come out at 
reasonable values — except when 
you’re trying to get very close to the 
sun. One important number is the 
sun escape velocity. If you have that 
much delta v capability, you can 
get to other stars — anywhere, for 
practical purposes. It is important 
to note, though, that Table One as- 
sumes you don’t start from Earth — 
but from orbit around Earth. 

Since you need 7.6 km/sec delta 
v to get into Earth orbit in the first 
place. Bob Heinlein’s top of the 
head remark was very close to cor- 
rect. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

Earth orbit is halfway to any- 
where.* 

In other words, the first step is 
the hard one. If you can get into 
Earth orbit you can get most any- 
where you want to go. Unfortu- 
nately the disintegrating totem 
poles we now use to get into orbit 
are just too cumbersome and 
expensive to make spaceflight rou- 
tine. Worse, they use up nearly all 
their total delta v getting into orbit 
and the rocket is thrown away — 
hundreds of millions of bucks into 
the drink. 

T he upcoming shuttle reusable 
ship will help and is sorely need- 
ed, but there’s a system even better 
than that. The concept I’m about 
to describe can use old rocket boos- 
ters over and over again — in fact, 
the rocket motor never leaves the 
ground. Only payload goes up. 

This magic feat is performed by 
lasers. The basic design of the sys- 
tem comes from A.N. Pirri and R. 
F. Weiss of Avco Everett research 
laboratories. What they propose is 
an enormous ground-based laser 
installation consuming about 3,000 
megawatts. In practice there would 
probably be a number of smaller 
lasers feeding into mirrors and the 
mirrors would then concentrate the 



* Quibblers will know that you’d have 
to stay in the plane of the ecliptic or 
use a lot more energy to get out of it— 
and that the Galaxy itself has a very 
high escape velocity, in the order of 
100km /sec from here. 



beam onto one single launching 
mirror about a meter in diameter. 
This ground station boosts the 
spacecraft — the ships themselves 
carry no rocket motors, but instead 
have a chamber underneath into 
which the laser beam is directed. 

The spacecraft weigh about a 
metric ton (1000 kilograms or 2200 
pounds) and are accelerated at 30 
g’s for about 30 seconds — that puts 
them in orbit. While the capsule is 
in the atmosphere the laser is 
pulsed at about 250 hertz (cycles 
per second when I was in school). 
Each pulse causes the air in the re- 
ceiving chamber to expand and be 
expelled rapidly. The chamber 
refills and another pulse hits — a 
laser-powered ramjet. For the final 
kick outside the atmosphere the 
laser power is absorbed directly in 
the chamber and part of the space- 
craft itself is ablated off and blown 
aft to function as reaction mass. Of 
the 1000 kg. starting weight about 
900 kg. goes into orbit. 

Some 80 metric tons can be put 
into orbit each hour at a total cost 
of around 3000 megawatt-hours. 
Figuring electricity at 3c a kilowatt 
hour, that’s $150 thousand — less 
than a dollar a kilogram — for fuel 
costs. Obviously there are operating 
costs and the spacecraft aren’t free, 
but the whole system is an order of 
magnitude more economical than 
anything we have now. 

Conventional power plants cost 
something like $300 per kilowatt — 
a 3000 megawatt power plant

HOHMANN TRANSFER ORBITS. The Target planet 
and the spacecraft arrive at the same point at the same 
time; Earth must be opposite that point at the time of 
launch. Hohmann orbitsare actually ellipses with the 
Sun at one focus, and if the spacecraft does not near a 
planet it will return to the starting point— only Earth 
will have moved away in the meantime. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 





would run close to a billion dollars 
in construction costs. However, 
when it isn’t being used for space 
launches it could feed power into 
the national grid, so some of that is 
recovered as salable power. The 
laser installation might easily run 
$5 billion, and another $5 billion in 
research may be needed. 

The point is that for an invest- 
ment on the order of what we put 
out to go to the moon, we could buy 
the research and construct the 
equipment for a complete operating 
spaceflight system, and then begin 
to exploit the economic possibilities 
of cheap spaceflight. 

Many benefits could accrue to an 
economical system of putting pay- 
load into orbit. Some are commer- 
cial — e.g. manufacture of materials 
that can only be made in gravity- 
free environments might be facili- 
tated. Others are not precisely com- 
mercial, but highly desirable. For 
example, the power/pollution prob- 
lem could be enormously helped. 
Solar cells can collect sunlight that 
would have fallen into the Earth. 
They convert it to electricity and 
send it down from orbit by micro- 
wave. That’s fed into the power 
grid, and when it’s used it becomes 
heat that would have arrived here 
anyway — the planetary heat bal- 
ance isn’t affected. 

Interestingly enough, it’s now be- 
lieved that orbiting solar power 
plants can be economically com- 
petitive with conventional plants, 
provided that we get the cost of a 



pound in orbit down to about $20. 
The laser launch system could 
power itself. 

We don’t even have to build a 
permanent power plant to get the 
laser-launcher into operation. 
There are a lot of old rocket motors 
around, and they’re very efficient at 
producing hot ionized gases. Hot 
ionized gas is the power source for 
electricity extracted by magneto- 
hydro-dynamics, or MHD. MHD is 
outside the scope of this article, but 
basically the system calls for a hot 
gas to be fed down a tube wrapped 
with conducting coils — and elec- 
tricity comes out. MHD systems are 
about as efficient as turbine sys- 
tems for converting fuel to electric- 
ity, and they can burn hydrogen to 
reduce pollution. 

The rocket engines wouldn’t last 
forever and it takes power to make 
the hydrogen they’d burn — but we 
wouldn’t have to use the system 
forever. It needn’t last longer than 
it would take to get the big station 
built in space and start up a solar- 
screen power plant. 

None of this is fantasy. The num- 
bers work. Avco has done some ex- 
periments with small-scale laser- 
powered “rockets” and they fly. 
There are no requirements for fun- 
damental breakthroughs, only a lot 
of development engineering, to get 
a full-scale working system. 

Laser launchers are at about the 
stage rockets were at circa 1953. 
Fifteen years and less than $20 bil- 
lion would do the job and we’d have 



100 



GALAXY 




a system to put nearly anything we 
wanted to have out there into orbit. 

That doesn’t seem like very much 
to get halfway to anywhere. 

I don’t remember whether I dis- 
covered science fiction or Willy 
Ley first. I do know that as a high- 
school sophomore I wrote a book 
report on the first edition of 
Rockets and Space Travel, and by 
the end of that year I was fasci- 
nated by the space frontier. Before 
that I’d never thought about going 
to the moon and beyond. After 
Willy Ley I thought of little else. I 
even took extra math in high school 
because I couldn’t follow Willy’s 
arguments without it — and when 
he referred to Oberth’s books, I 
had to read those, too, and that 
needed more math. 

Eventually I made a career in the 
space program, managing experi- 
mental human stress studies, writ- 
ing spacecraft proposals and finally 
ending as a generalist — they called 
us systems analysts. For years we 
wrote science fiction without plots 
or characters. We called them fore- 
casts, but they were sf all the same. 
It hasn’t been hard to change over 
to the straight stuff. 

It is one of life’s ironies that 
Willy Ley didn’t live to watch Eagle 
set down on the moon. Of the 
people I knew in the space pro- 
gram, I suppose fully half of them 
became interested in rockets and 
space because they read books by 
Willy Ley. So Willy didn’t see it 



happen, but I think he had as 
much to do with making Eagle pos- 
sible as any man of this century. 

And, of course, Willy Ley used to 
write Galaxy ' s science column. 

I won’t take his place, but I can 
try to make science and technology 
as interesting as Willy made it for 
me. Also, Ejler Jakobsson and I 
hope there will be reader response 
that will permit us to deal with 
questions that you feel need answers 
and cover topics of both immediate 
and long-term interest. While keep- 
ing in mind that readers, writers — 
and even editors — also need some 
fun. 

We’ll consider any question 
about science and technology. We 
may also look into psychic phenom- 
ena, since the AAAS is starting a 
section on Psi — it’s almost estab- 
lishment now. For that matter, the 
AAAS has invited Dr. Immanual 
Velikovsky to address an annual 
meeting — and you can be sure I’ll 
report on that! 

We also invite reader comments 
and information, since it’s barely 
possible there are things going on 
that I haven’t heard about. I’ll try 
to follow up interesting tips and get 
interviews with people working at 
the far edges of science and tech- 
nology. I’ll also have some views 
about the effects of current tech- 
nological trends on all of us. 

Galaxy and I hope you will draw 
as much mindfood and enjoyment 
from this column as we expect to 
gain. ★ 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

The little alien became anything 
he wanted— and he left a gift . 



T he discovery of Earth might 
slip by unnoticed. It might 
mean nothing. Wanderers might 
touch gently upon Earth many 
times and never think to notify the 
universe. A voyager might come 
and go, leaving a gift of himself in- 
comprehensible and lost forever. 

Solo entered the pale blue atmos- 
phere of Earth. He guided his small 
ship carefully through the hot blue 
light. As he neared the surface of 
the land the color temperature 
shifted out of the blue range to long 
cool rays of red. He landed in the 
extraordinary red wash of the 
South Carolina sun. 

Solo lay folded in his little ship as 
a child might lie folded within an 
egg. His body was exposed and sen- 
sitive to the color of light and he lay 
pale and cool as if wrapped in red 
cellophane. 

It was late afternoon and late 
summer in 1963. The ship opened 
and Solo stood on the red soil of 
South Carolina. It was quiet out- 
side on the country, minutely still 
as red dust. The hills were worn 
down, soft and deserted with age, 
left to die alone like old dogs. 

Alongside Solo’s ship lay the 
rusted knife-edged body of a 
junked automobile. Farther away, 

THE DISCOVERY OF EARTH 



across the soft red dust of the yard, 
there was a small house built of dis- 
carded lumber and corrugated 
metal. The metal hurt his eyes and 
Solo looked away. 

Because there was no one to see 
him, Solo was barely defined 
against the light. He was pale and 
ghostly as a strange deep-water 
fish. Only his eyes of a fiery chrome 
green, and the life fluids beating 
within him, betrayed him as mortal 
and vulnerable. 

Solo had no home but the little 
sailing ship. His soul belonged to a 
race of pale gypsies, but he be- 
longed to no one. Solo was not a 
poet, but a poem. He was not a 
painter. He was the painting. His 
slender ghostly form belonged to no 
one and belonged to anyone. 

What he was, was a trader. He 
had one gift to give in return for the 
form and shape of himself. His gift 
was a chrome-green egg as fiery as 
a panther’s eye. Inside the egg lay 
the universe. Solo’s unborn child. 

Solo waited by his ship for some- 
one to come. The little sailing ship 
lay collapsed in a vague transparent 
heap. It looked like nothing. It had 
no masts, no hull, but it was very 
much a sailing ship, running with 
its slender sail bent under the con- 
stant energy of light. Now it lay 
inert like a cobweb thrown to the 
ground. Only Solo’s touch could 
bring it to life. 

Solo waited. He pressed the soles 
of his feet into the warm red dust 
and watched the land. He let the red 

103 




light wash his skin and his eyes and 
he waited for the form and sub- 
stance of what he could become. 

By the time Solo heard the first 
sounds of someone coming, the red 
light of the sun had washed out into 
a clean pale gray light. Crickets 
and frogs had begun to shriek. The 
mule came along the hard black 
road, its head moving up and down 
with the clipping of its hooves. 
Close on its rump the mule pulled 
an ancient wagon which came 
creaking and swaying on large 
wooden wheels banded in iron. 

The wagon and mule came as if 
wandering, as if the road only 
happened to be there, following be- 
neath the wheels. The wagon was 
built of the same discarded boards 
as the house, pieces of broken wood 
that had all been part of something 
else and now were piled one on the 
other for a utility without form or 
beauty, or even the will to fall 
apart. 

At the front of the wagon, high 
up on the narrow ledge, a yellow 
dog was riding high and cocky, 
fastened up tight against a skinny 
old black man. 

T hey came all together, one to 
themselves, the old man’s hand 
flapping with soft slack reins and 
shoulders humping with the shock 
of rolling iron. The wagon and the 
mule were the same, old warped 
boards resurrected, the mule long 
faded like a dead thing from the 
sea, the whole of them coming, 



alone and single, old black man 
and yellow fur dog. 

Solo stood watching and still as 
the wagon moved across the yard 
and stopped in a haze of dust. 
There was a space of silence as the 
wagon itself settled and became 
still. Then one of the mule’s long 
ears dangled in Solo’s direction. 

All at once the dog came- off the 
wagon in a high wild leap. Solo 
stayed where he was, pale and un- 
sure, as the dog tore soundlessly 
across the yard toward him. The 
dog charged with terrifying intent, 
only to fall at Solo’s feet. The 
yellow dog had found his mate. He 
leaped away, bounding stiff-tailed, 
stiff-toed, dancing for Solo. 

The old man finally seemed to 
notice. He spoke to the dog. “You 
dog. Get away from that boy,” he 
said. 

The dog began running around 
the house, mad with joy. The old 
man continued unbuckling the 
harness from the mule and paid no 
attention to Solo. 

Solo edged nearer to the old 
man. The old man did not look at 
him again after he had spoken to 
the dog. The old man had seen a 
hungry young boy with dusty brown 
skin. He did not need to look again. 

The harness dropped to the 
ground around the mule. Still its 
ghost remained, a harness of long 
thin lines about the mule’s body 
where the leather straps had worn 
into its skin. The old man rubbed 
down the mule with his bare hands. 



104 



GALAXY 




His own skin was as worn off and 
shiny gray as the mule’s. After the 
rubdown the mule wandered off. 
Like the old man, it paid no atten- 
tion to Solo. 

The old man walked to the door 
of the house but did not go inside. 
The door was broken off its hinges 
and rested against the side of the 
house. The old man sat on the open 
sill of the doorway. He stretched his 
legs out on the dirt and pulled 
something small and shiny out of a 
pocket of his overalls. He sat there 
a long while, holding it in his fist as 
the darkness closed on him. 

Solo crossed his legs and sat in 
the dust of the old man’s yard. He 
rubbed his hand over his head. He 
felt a mat of warm dusty hair. The 
dog had run off and he waited 
alone with the old man. He gave no 
sign of going away. 

At last the old man opened his 
fist and revealed the small mouth 
harp that lay in his palm. He 
brought it up to his lips. The little 
harp, wrapped up in both old 
hands, began to sing. 

Solo sat enchanted. He forgot his 
newly hungry belly. He forgot his 
little sailing ship. He forgot every- 
thing but the little harp hiding in 
the old man’s hands. It became 
very dark, still he watched the 
solitary notes slip through the old 
man’s fingers. 

Finally, because of what the old 
man had made of him, Solo began 
to tremble with hunger and exhaus- 
tion. The old man knew. In one 



motion he slid the harp into a 
pocket and disappeared through 
the doorway. Inside, in the dark, he 
lit the kerosene lamp. The mantles 
threw off a yellow flickering light 
that leaped through the doorway 
toward Solo. 

Then the old man was standing 
in the flames of light. “Boy. You 
there, boy?” he said. 

Solo jumped to his feet. “Yes 
sir,” he said. 

“Step inside boy. You can sleep 
the night here.” 

S olo stepped across the slab of 
wood that separated the inside 
from the outside. The lantern was 
hissing steadily. The floor was the 
same red dirt that lay out in the 
yard. The old man set two bowls on 
a table. They sat together at the 
table and ate cold red beans. 

In the light of the lamp Solo 
watched the old man. The old 
man’s eyes were deep and black as 
caves. They reflected no light. The 
things that went into them never 
came out again. 

The old man scraped some beans 
into a dish and put them outside 
the door. Then he crossed the room 
to his cot. He sat down but his 
hands were restless. 

Solo’s own hands were restless 
and he stuck them into the pockets 
of his overalls. The old man 
shrugged, muttered to himself and 
dipped Solo a cup of water. 
Something tapped under his hand 
on the table. When he drew away 



THE DISCOVERY OF EARTH 



105 




his hand the little harp remained. 

“Go on, boy. It’s burning a hole 
in my pocket with you watching me 
all the time,” he said. 

Solo was shocked at how much 
his hands wanted to hold on to the 
harp. He could see what it looked 
like for the first time. The wooden 
struts that separated the notes were 
still wet and swollen from the old 
man’s playing. The bright metal 
cover was stamped with the words: 

M. HOHNER. MARINE BAND. Solo 

closed his hand around it but his 
fist was not big enough to cover it 
like the old man’s. 

Solo grinned. “It’s hot,” he said. 

“Yes sir,” the old man said. 
“Burned a hole right in my 
pocket.” Solemnly he pulled out his 
pocket and showed Solo the hole. 

So Solo sat that night in the old 
man’s house, playing the old man’s 
songs. He knew it was a mistake. It 
was a mistake, for all the times in 
his sailing ship the old man’s songs 
would not be with him. But his 
hands held the little harp the way 
he had seen the old man hold it and 
he watched the solitary notes slip 
through his own fingers and he for- 
got that it was a mistake. 

The old man had taken the blan- 
ket off the cot and spread it on the 
floor for Solo. When Solo finished 
the old man was lying on the cot, 
his face to the ceiling. The old man 
said nothing and Solo left the harp 
on the table. He lay down on the 
blanket in his overalls, his face to 
the ceiling. 



There was only the sound of the 
lantern and then the old man 
spoke. “You is fine, boy,” he said. 
“You is fine.” 

The old man screwed down the 
lantern. The room began to grow 
closer and dimmer and then it was 
black. In the dark, Solo stared at 
the ghosts of what had been. 

He heard the old man moving to 
the blanket. He felt the edges of the 
harp as it was pressed into his 
palm. 

“This is a no-good harp. Blown- 
out. Rusted. No good. You have it, 
boy." 

Solo’s lips were aching and raw 
from scraping across the little 
blocks of wood. He could not talk. 

The old man said, “I get me a 
brand new one. Two dollars. Brand 
new.” 

It was very dark. Through the 
open door clean damp air moved 
over Solo and he began to cry. He 
cried until he fell asleep, without 
knowing if it was himself crying, or 
the old man’s boy. 

a ice, long before the sun came 
up, Solo left the house and ran 
off into the hills. The yellow dog 
had returned, prancing and excited 
with the urge for love. The yellow 
dog pressed his shoulder against 
Solo’s and they ran together, Solo 
running with wild panther-green 
eyes, running as the yellow dog’s 
mate. 

In the early morning the old man 
woke first. The early light that 



106 



GALAXY 




entered the house was gray and cool 
and wet. Solo lay curled on the 
blanket, still sleeping, as the old 
man moved about. Once the old 
man looked at his face, at the lids 
of his eyes, which were closed and 
secret. 

Softly he started a small fire in 
the wood stove with newspaper and 
kindling. He filled a pan with water 
and set it on the stove for the oat- 
meal. While he was doing this his 
hand sometimes slipped in and out 
of his pocket. He himself did not 
eat. He watched the boy sleeping 
and then he went out to catch the 
mule. 

The dusty red light on his skin 
woke Solo. He stood in the doorway 
and watched the sun come up. The 
yard was empty. The wagon was 
gone. Because there was no one to 
see him he was very pale, the color 
of the sun. He stood quietly in the 
doorway as the first heat of the day 
began to roll up from the earth. 

The old man had placed a clean 
bowl on the table for him. A pan of 
warm oatmeal sat on top of the 
wood stove. Solo crossed the room 
to the blanket where he had slept. 
He picked up the harp and held it 
tightly in one fist. 

He sat on the old man’s cot until 
early afternoon. The old man’s 
shiny gift stayed closed in his fist. 
The little harp was cold and 
strange. He did not look at it or 
bring it to his lips. At last he went 
to the table, did what he had to do 
and left the gift he had to give. 



In the evening the old man re- 
turned. He did not look for the boy. 
The dog stayed close by him while 
he rubbed down the mule. He 
wiped his hands on his pants. 
Against his will his hands slipped in 
and out of the pockets of his over- 
alls. 

He wandered to the house with- 
out purpose. He got the lantern go- 
ing and pumped it to a fierce white 
brightness. The clean bowl was still 
there on the table. The boy had left 
no mark in his house. 

Then he saw that there was 
something else on the table. It was 
the little mouth harp, and against 
the harp rested a small chrome- 
green egg. The shell was of a color 
he had never seen before and he 
gently rolled it in his palm. The egg 
seemed to leap from within with 
green fire. 

The second time that day the old 
man built a fire in the wood stove. 
He placed the egg in the center of 
the bowl on the table. The fiery 
green egg lay in the bowl, solitary 
as a panther’s eye. Inside the egg 
lay the universe. 

The old man took the egg and 
broke it on the edge of an iron pan. 
It cooked quickly and he ate his 
first food of the day. 

After a while the old man took 
the harp from the table and sat in 
the shadow of the doorway. He 
played across the black hills and 
black sky. His old hands were 
sweating with a need for the boy to 
hear him. ★

T he rainbow went out of his head 
and of course he was left color- 
less. But Led Wyatt had been in 
Ihis situation before. It didn’t 
matter that now he looked a lot like 
the drab world outside the time 
cruiser, with winter clouds in his 
hair and a leftover gleam in his 
eyes. It didn’t matter. He could still 
led the big play coming up — a tired 
llirill that was churning in his 
brain. Last of the orbits, planet 
loaded, score untied. 

Belt one outa here, babe. 
“Bullshit!” Wyatt said to the 
transmitter that was embedded in 
his wisdom tooth, the one on the 
lower left side. 

“You got a problem, Wyatt?” A 
voice in his ears, blunt and slightly 
time-distorted, belonging to one of 
the guys he’d never seen who coach- 
ed the time shot from back at the 
monitor and the computer and the 
St. Louis base. “Everything looks 
green-and-go here on the board.” 
Wyatt instinctively checked him- 
self (which included the cruiser) for 
leeling and function. He agreed 
with green-and-go. Electronically, 
he agreed. But he wished he could 
spit. 

He said, “This is a bum trip.” 
“A what?” 

“A bum trip.” 

“Is that bum? B-U-M?” 

“Yeah. What the hell differ- 
ence — ” 

“Hold on, Wyatt.” 

The way he held on was with a 
weary sigh of disbelief. He knew 



what they were doing. They were 
getting a definition from the com- 
puter. When it came a moment 
later he tried to be amused, but 
there was no place for a laugh in 
the tired anger of his darkening 
mood. 

“ Bum trip is an old expression 
from the nineteen-sixties. It means 
a no-good reaction to the ingestion 
of drugs.” 

“How about a no-good reaction 
to a lousy assignment?” 

“No good.” 

“Screw you,” said Wyatt. 

Wanting more stretch, he ad- 
justed his position. Around him the 
padded cocoon reflowed to com- 
pensate for his moves. Then the 
cruiser shifted slightly to cover the 
changes in the cocoon. Wyatt felt it 
all happen — it was nothing new as 
far as he was concerned. If he had a 
superdollar for every time he’d 
been attached, for every time he’d 
come black-and-white to the end of 
the world, for every time he’d been 
expected to save the remnants of 
Earth & Moon, and for every 
time he’d actually done it . Well, 
what could he do with the money 
anyway? Buy a beach house for his 
old age? Uh-uh. There were no 
more beach houses (no beaches), 
no more log cabins (no logs), no 
more grass shacks (no grass), and 
all the money not left in the world 
couldn’t even buy him a 40 x 40 lot 
in the retirement of Sun City (the 
sun itself, rarely visible, a burning 
globe from way back when). 



OUTFIELDER

“Can you guys see the sun to- 
day?” he wanted to know. 

“Haven’t looked,” was the reply. 

“What’s the forecast?” 

“Five per cent chance.” 

“Big deal,” said Wyatt, mulling 
it over. 

Sunshine. Galactic League. 
Soaking it up. 

Three seasons of roving in the 
outfield, and best of all were the 
days when they could roll back the 
dome and be touched by the fine 
heat of the sun. A little sweat, a 
summer shadow, chasing with him 
back to the fence. 

Not very often, days like that. 
Then not at all. Earth & Moon, 
having little left of anything, was 
cut out of the Galactic League. The 
franchise moved. Led Wyatt 
didn’t — his unique talents had al- 
ready been recruited by the new 
government project in St. Louis. 

The new project was now a 
wornout bitch. 

Bitterly Wyatt shook himself out 
of the sunny day and into the bleak 
mist of the future. 

Form and substance, he was 
built into his cruiser and scurrying 
forward through time to the place 
where it all ended. But who really 
cared? There were enough living 
worlds to handle all of the known 
population to the tenth power. 
There was no need for Earth & 
Moon. Saving Earth & Moon over 
and over and over again was like 
washing out rags. Hardly worth the 
effort. 



44 ^teah, I’m still alive,” Wyatt 
JL reported in a voice that for 
him was a whisper. “The reason 
I’m not talking is because I’ve got 
nothing to tell you.” 

“Are you almost there?” persist- 
ed the St. Louis base. 

“How the hell do I know? The 
color’s been gone for about five cen- 
turies, but sometimes the whole 
business just drags on and on.” 
“We figured you’d be there al- 
ready.” 

“Well, junk the figures and 
listen to me. I’ll know it when I see 
it. Or better yet, get your tail out 
here and see if you can do it your- 
self.” 

“Time-travelers — ” When the 
statement began, Wyatt could tell 
it was the lead-in to the ungolden 
rule that was the scourge of his life. 
He wanted to shut off his ears. 
“ — are born, not made.” 

“Funny how they’re not born too 
often,” Wyatt replied. “I’ve got a 
feeling that I’ve been shafted.” 
“You’ve been what?” 

“Shafted!” 

“Hold on, Wyatt.” Quickly to 
the computer and quickly back. “A 
shaft is the long handle of a spear.” 
“All right, then I’ve been spear- 
ed.” 

“Do you mean that you’ve been 
treated badly?” 

“Something like that.” 

“It’s not true, Wyatt. There are 
ten known time-travelers and you’re 
all highly paid. You were the first. 
Now you’re the oldest. The problem 



110 



GALAXY 




is that you’re too old. But we only 
call on you when the other nine are 
busy — or when we need your 
specialty.” 

Instinctively Wyatt checked the 
console, the lights, the screen, his 
fingers, and took a look outside. 
The cold gray stream of swiftly 
passing time made him shiver, but 
a sixth sense told him that every- 
thing was quiet and that he was still 
far from the approaching threat of 
nonexistence. 

He said, “You’re right. I’m too 
old.” 

“Well, you refuse to train any of 
the others. You won’t even talk to 
them. As soon as you come back 
from a trip you go off with that 
woman.” 

“Not any more.” 

“Oh, broke up, huh? Well, at 
your age there’s not much left to 
offer a woman.” 

Wyatt ran his tongue over dry 
lips. 

He said, “She died, you 
bastard.” 

For a few seconds the base fell 
silent. Even measured by the 
depths of the usual sarcasm, it 
wasn’t much of a pause. It didn’t 
reflect shock; it didn’t give con- 
cern; it didn’t show respect. Every- 
body dies, especially on Earth & 
Moon. 

“Sorry,” the answer came, float- 
ing in metallic sobriety from one 
ear to the other. 

Wyatt closed his eyes. 

Sandra. Sandy. Honey. 



Remembering her was like listen- 
ing to the scratches at the end of a 
tape. The images were only of those 
final days . She would squeeze 
his hand when she had the strength, 
smile tiredly when she felt his pity. 
(“Mmmm, Led, this warms me all 
the way through. Once I had a dog 
called Brandy — it’s a nice name for 
a dog.”) But breathing emphyse- 
matously, but coughing blood, but 
growing thinner, but dreaming 
nightmares, but never fighting to 
drag it out, only dying with a scrap 
of dignity. (“No matter how far out 
you go in time, you’ll always be able 
to call me yours — always.”) Few 
women were left on Earth & Moon 
and none like her. She was his last 
woman. 

It was always the last of some- 
thing. That was the business he was 
in, Wyatt thought. It was up to him 
to preplan the complete disposal of 
whatever items could cause the end 
of the world. And it was true that 
he was the expert — the only expert. 
He and the time cruiser were a 
single working unit that could sense 
the danger point within a year, zero 
in on it and analyze the conditions 
that brought it on. Many, many 
trips so far and never had he failed 
to find the end and extend it. The 
real expertise came in figuring out 
how, in determining the cause and 
effect and in going back to the pre- 
sent to change the cause. 

The key to the trick was to catch 
it before the end (otherwise — 
blooey). If it weren’t for that, one of 



OUTFIELDER 



111 




the others might be able to do it. 
But to sense the situation, to find 
the right answer, all before it was 
too late — that was deep in the brain 
of Led Wyatt. 

A great natural hitter, babe. 






Qt<

k uiT laughing,” Wyatt mut- 
tered. 

TrrTjust remembering some of 
your weirdies.” 

“Which ones?” 

“Most of them. The bottles, for 
instance.” 

Wyatt winced. That wasn’t from 
a recent trip, that was from one of 
the first. All bottles had to go. All 
glass bottles (weren’t many left any- 
way) and all plastic bottles (just a 
few million), with no exceptions. 
Bury them, sink them, send them 
to the other planets. 

All right. So whiskey now came 
in squeezebags. And everything 
else was either piped in or freeze- 
dried. After all, it only affected 
some ten thousand people, the poor 
unlucky bastards who were assign- 
ed to keep Earth & Moon running. 

“Big deal,” Wyatt said. “What 
are you, a bottle baby?” 

Giggling in his ears like a clown 
in heat, the St. Louis base could 
only come up with a flicker of 
steadiness in the voice that carried 
on the debate. “You’ve got to ad- 
mit that you pick out some strange 
disposals.” 

“I don’t pick them out. God 
picks them out — somebody picks' 
them out. I just find them.” 



More laughing. “God didn’t pick 
out bowling trophies.” 

“For chrissakes, that was — ” 
“Or pinochle cards. How about 
that, Wyatt? You think God ever 
played pinochle?” 

“You know damn well why we 
had to get rid of the cards,” Wyatt 
said. “Those jerks who were sup- 
posed to be monitoring the atomic 
stockpile were so wrapped up in 
their pinochle game that they 
didn’t see the warning light.” 
“That’s your story.” 

“You must be dumb enough to 
believe it,” Wyatt replied. “You 
keep sending me out.” 

“Well, whenever we get a sig- 
nal . You’ll see,, one of these 
times we’ll take a chance on a 
younger guy.” 

‘‘Go ahead. And he’ll keep 
telling you what I keep telling 
you — get rid of the stockpile.” 
Wyatt shook his head with the 
nearest approach to helplessness 
that he’d ever been able to achieve — 
and even though he knew that no 
one could see him he quickly- 
turned his mien into a scowl that 
deepened and darkened the lines in 
his face. With a routine glance at 
the panel lights he continued his 
argument. “Most of the trouble 
comes up at the nuclear warehouse. 
If you’re going to keep all those 
megatons of fissionable materials, 
then you’ve got to expect to get ig- 
nition.” 

“Not if you keep stopping it. You 
know we’ve got to have the stuff. 



112 



GALAXY 




It’s energy for all the worlds — heat, 
fuel, defense, power — for all the 
worlds, Wyatt.” 

“Doesn’t do much for Earth Sc 
Moon except make us into a match- 
stick,” he answered. 

“Come off it, Wyatt.” The St. 
Louis base sounded a bit more 
serious. “We need the stockpile 
more than anyone else. It’s all 
we’ve got. If Earth & Moon wasn’t 
a warehouse it’d be abandoned. 
One function, dangerous as hell — 
that’s what keeps this place going.” 

“Then don’t go getting jacked up 
about the pinochle cards,” Wyatt 
told him. 

Or anything else, he thought, 
picturing the list. Rifles. Ballpoint 
pens, monkeys, and self-help psy- 
chology books. Easter Sunday, dig- 
ital thermometers, circuses, sleep- 
ing pills, aluminum siding, stand- 
up desks, prostitutes, small air- 
planes, diamond mines in South 
Africa, glue, extension cords, bour- 
bon, snow shovels (good riddance), 
parrots, tennis shoes, cigarettes — 
no, that was for cancer. He was 
getting mixed up with the cancer 
list: cigarettes, mustard, cranber- 
ries, charcoal, deodorants — no end 
to that list either — and then there 
was the heart list and the ecology 
list (too late) and the morality list 
and some day the list list. 

Unfortunately, time travel — 

Wyatt leaned forward in the 
cruiser, only slightly, which was as 
far as he could go because he was 
part of it, watching the traces of a 



gray fog rolling in around him. 

— was still permitted. 

The fog was a sign for sure. He 
sniffed, trying to get the feel of it. 
Not yet. Not quite yet. 

The cruiser bumped along in 
some unappreciated turbulence. It 
was shaking up his stomach. That 
was another thing that had started 
recently: a stomach full of belching 
gas and narrow shooting pains, 
now and then, even through time, 
even though he was eating more 
mildly and drinking much less. He 
thought that maybe it was because 
he’d given up women. He’d heard 
that somewhere. Or read it. Sex 
and the stomach, sex and the 
brain, sex and the nerves. A lot 
could happen to a guy who wasn’t 
getting it any more. 



W yatt cursed too loudly. The 
transmitter in his tooth had 
once been perfectly installed, but 
lately at high volume it caused vi- 
brations to reach down to his toes; 
and in this exuberant case they 
were bouncing back to cause a sec- 
ondary shock and limit his choice 
of strong words to just one. 
Fiercely, but more quietly, he 
added, “Don’t you guys have 
nothing better to do?” 

“Just staying tuned in, in case 
you need any help.” The voice in 
his ears was getting lower in tone, 
as if someone were turning his nose 
clockwise to bass. Actually, it was 
the increasing length of time-dis- 



OUTFIELOER 



113 




tance that was stretching the 
soundwaves. 

“How much time has passed 
since I left?” Wyatt asked. 

“You mean back here?” 

“Yeah, you nuts — where do you 
think I mean?” 

There was a recognizable pause, 
obviously for the higher math of 
computer calculations. All they had 
to do was look at a wristwatch, 
Wyatt thought — but hell, no, that 
was too easy. He gnashed his teeth. 
He hoped it generated eons of 
static. 

“Two hours, fourteen minutes,” 
came the reply. 

“Then 1 should be there al- 
ready,” Wyatt said, shifting with 
the contour pads that held his body 
and automatically moved him into 
regulated positions. “With all the 
goddamn practice you’ve had, 
you’d think that once in a while you 
could come close to pinpointing it.” 

"That’s your trick, Wyatt.” 

“But, hell, you know it happen- 
ed. Tell me when.” 

“We told you.” 

“Bull. You didn’t tell me, you 
sent me. With what you told me I 
couldn’t find the day after tomor- 
row or an open bedroom at Mama 
Flo’s. Maybe I could stand and hit 
the fast ball without knowing where 
it would be, because I could afford 
to miss it; but the end of Earth & 
Moon is faster and wilder and 
noisier and if it happens just 
once — ” 

“It won’t. You’re on the right 



track and we put you there. You 
couldn’t get anywhere without the 
St. Louis base.” 

“Don’t I know it,” Wyatt grum- 
bled, mostly to himself. 

“What did you say?” 

“I said blow it." He cut himself 
short, realizing that the conver- 
sation was costing him full aware- 
ness of the cruiser as it (he) stoked 
the years toward a roaring fire that 
he (it) had to snuff out. 

But the base was still explaining. 

“Listen, Wyatt, we’re doing the 
best we can. It’s like tuning in an 
FM station. We get it and then it 
drifts away. We know it’s there be- 
cause we can read it, but it covers a 
wide spectrum of the dial. Just keep 
going — you’ll find it.” 

“Sure,” said Wyatt. 

He let out a breath that fluttered 
his lips. Was anything going on? 
The dials in front of him, a 
fan-shaped set of twelve, were spin- 
ning and changing so rapidly that 
they were meaningful only to the 
onboard computer and even that 
was subject to doubt. And all the 
lights on the console — if one could 
visualize a logical console with no 
physical shape being everywhere in 
the cruiser — were flashing inter- 
mittently, with one vital exception: 
a small bank of parallel lights, near 
his right hand, was dark and wait- 
ing. 

At the moment the best clues 
were outside. The color and the 
fog. There was no color. There was 
a lot of fog. A gray slowly turning 



114 



GALAXY 




black like the dusk of eternity. Sure 
enough, he was getting close. 

In his ears the base said bluntly, 
“One-point-eight centuries since 
the last report.” 

“Shut up,” he snapped back. 

It was time for concentration. 
Whatever was happening would 
soon be in range. 

By thinking about it, he activated 
the screen. It was there like he was 
there, part of everything — yet in its 
unique way it was a bay window 
with a sweeping, zooming, pano- 
ramic view of hundreds of kilo- 
meters of nuclear storage. It was 
(he was) out of focus. The blur of 
the screen was part fog and part the 
rapid movement of time. There was 
no reason to tune in sharply until 
the moment there was something to 
see. 

That moment, Wyatt knew, was 
about to ring in. 

His thoughts moved into the 
focus mode. On a separate level, 
the chill that ran icily from his head 
to his spine had nothing to do with 
electrical impulses or cruiser tem- 
perature — it was the ache in the 
bones, it was the trick knee, it was 
the dry socket in the shoulder, it 
was the corns on the bottom of the 
feet, it was the skip in the heart- 
beat — it was, of course, the inner 
signal that he’d been waiting for. 

Good eye, baby . 

’ll let you know,” Wyatt said 
flatly. 

“But you’ve got the screen on.” 



The St. Louis base, in a stretched 
out, far off drawl, was showing 
signs of excitement. 

“So what?” 

“You must be there, Wyatt.” 

“I’ll let you know.” 

“Are you starting to time-focus?” 

“Pretty soon.” Wyatt’s mind toy- 
ed with the control without moving 
it. 

“What do you see?” 

“Nothing yet. Quit yelling in my 
ears.” 

But he saw the small bank of 
lights, dormant throughout the 
trip, start to flicker like wind-blown 
candles — and even if he hadn’t seen 
it from the corner of an eye, he 
would have sensed the same thing. 
There was an absolute stillness that 
involved the whole Earth & Moon. 
It seemed as if that point in time 
were without life or breath or 
sound. And yet all of that hush was 
only in his mind, with a meaning 
that reached to the opposite ex- 
treme, because somewhere out in 
the world there was the beginning 
of violent action and the silence was 
breaking. 

Here again, he thought. The 
end, the cause — and what would it 
be? 

“C’mon, Wyatt, what’s happen- 
ing?” 

‘‘If you would quit bugging 
me — ” he answered, and his eyes 
were hard. 

It would be a gang of teenage ty- 
rants, turned on by the old quad 
tapes of Carter Lee Cash, storming 




OUTFIELDER 



115 




the atomic center. Chains and 
sledges and miniature flamethrow- 
ers. And with ancient Nashville 
beating in their earpieces they 
smash through the gates and tear 
out the equipment and destroy the 
controls and gleefully brew a radio- 
active turmoil that becomes the be- 
ginning spark of a doomsday 
explosion. 

Cause: country music. Eliminate 
guitars. 

“Are you getting a signal?” 

“Yeah, I think so,” Wyatt said. 
It would be the host computer, 
which somebody forgot to repro- 
gram for February 29th, overacti- 
vating the fusionable stockpile. As 
the confused cycle of the calendar- 
timer starts correcting in the wrong 
direction, the sensors read the feed- 
back as if it were midsummer; the 
automatic removal-and-replace- 
ment procedure is unexpected at 
that time and so is the mushroom 
cloud. 

Cause: an extra day. Eliminate 
leap years. 

“God almighty, Wyatt, we’ve got 
it ourselves. You’re there! You’re 
there!” 

The flickering lights were now a 
frightening staccato of red embers. 
Wyatt looked up at the screen, 
mildly surprised to find it still 
blurred. His nerve ends tightened 
on the focusing knob. It would be a 
freight elevator, breaking loose of 
its cables, plunging through the 
leadsteel skin of the cooling tower 
and rupturing the lines that carry 



in the water and carry out the 
steam. The vats of charged rods 
grow warmer and warmer, but they 
never get as hot as the blast that 
follows. 

Cause: height. Rebuild every- 
thing on one floor. 

“Have you got it, Wyatt?” the 
St. Louis base demanded to know. 
“Should we bring you back now?” 

“Wait a minute,” Wyatt said. 

“You don’t have a minute! Do 
you know how long a minute is out 
there? In a minute the whole 
damned thing — ” 

ii\\T 1LL be shot to hell,” Wyatt 
W said after a while, but there 
was only peace in his ears. 

He had passed it by — gone right 
on ahead. He thought he caught 
sight of the sudden flash and a 
quick sniff of burned Earth & 
Moon — it was a fuzzy memory al- 
most as soon as it happened. And 
now, inside the cruiser, he felt the 
strange sensation of being past the 
point in time where everything 
ended. There was no way back. 
Neither, to his amazement, was 
there any kind of sudden stop. The 
fog had changed to utter blackness, 
but Led Wyatt could still sense the 
forward movement. He was shoot- 
ing through time, and it was in- 
finite, and he would go on for- 
ever and ever and ever ... Or at 
least until the ship ran out of . 

A time cruiser, he remembered 
darkly, runs out of nothing. 

Give it a ride, baby ... ★

W ell, I told you — we’re be- 
coming, if not respectable, 
then the subjects (perhaps I should 
say targets) of respectable assess- 
ments from the bigdomes and the 
heavyweights. Here is New Worlds 
for Old, by David Ketterer ($2.95, 
indexed, 347 pages, a Doubleday 
Anchor paperback.) Subtitled: The 
Apocalyptic Imagination, Science 
Fiction, and American Literature, 
this chunky tome is one of a whole 
library annex of forthcoming new 
books about the sf phenomenon. 

David Ketterer operates out of 
Montreal, where he is a Professor 
of English at Concordia University. 
His book is the product of an 
immense amount of research and 
an irresistible determination to 
apply the term “apocalyptic” to the 
literature of speculation. He writes 
a determined and unleavened 
prose, does his footnotes and attri- 
butions impeccably, and is a 
perfect example — a most rarefied 
and refined example — of what I am 



irresistibly determined to call The 
Labeler. 

I cannot knock The Labeler — he 
performs many valuable functions 
and is the product of the evolution 
of rational thinking, the well-honed 
weapon against fuzziness and 
against blind faith. As he ap- 
proaches his work each morning he 
makes his obeisance to the com- 
mandment: Define Your Terms. 
His conviction is that nothing can 
be handled, can be understood, can 
be placed in an ideational se- 
quence, unless every part of the 
specimen be described and defined 
and every term used in this defini- 
tion be in turn defined — until you 
get prose like this: 

... I have defined as 
apocalyptic any work of fic- 
tion concerned with present- 
ing a radically different world 
or version of reality that exists 
in a credible relationship with 
the world or reality verified by 



118 




empiricism and common ex- 
perience — the world or reality 
the author may assume his 
reader to bring to a reading of 
his work. My use of the adjec- 
tive “credible” rather than 
the narrower qualifier “ra- 
tional” is based on the as- 
sumption that an act of faith 
and an act of reason may be 
equally and inextricably in- 
volved in the acceptance of 
any unseen world that is, in 
some sense, concordant with 
the known world. 

The end product is, inevitably, 
the use of a great many more words 
and the loss of that great guiding 
principle that basics are simple and 
that complicated things, though 
they may be poignant and passion- 
ate and shakingly important, are by 
their very nature not basic. The 
passion for microscopic precision 
exemplified in the passage above 
also implies that the imprecise, the 
infra-rational, the wordless cry, do 
not communicate nor exactly 
define. Bradbury once wrote of fire- 
works that before you can raise a 
pointing finger, before you can say, 
“There!” the thing is gone — and 
yet, it isn’t gone and you know it 
isn’t. I had an agent many years 
ago, for a score of months, and we 
came to the parting of the ways 
because he wanted me to sign a 
contract. The contract ran four 
pages and had twenty-one clauses. 
I wanted to be able to say, “You are 



my agent”, which seamlessly states 
that the man had the right to ten 
per cent of my income. He could 
never grasp the fact that to 
surround anyone with a thousand- 
part palisade creates a structure 
with a thousand cracks. Scholastics 
seem sometimes to achieve defini- 
tion at the expense of statement — 
so devoted are they to getting the 
parts in the right boxes that, to 
readers other than their colleagues, 
they run the risk of losing the form 
and texture of the thing analyzed. 

Again I say that such work is use- 
ful and valuable, admirable and 
worthy, and I would be the first to 
concede that it is not mutally 
exclusive with the intuitive, the 
“love is when — ” type of definition/ 
description. (“Love is when it’s also 
good to get out of bed, morning- 
time,” a young lady once told me.) 
Few phrases have conveyed so 
much about the work we do here as 
has “sense of wonder” — and few 
phrases have bled so badly, lost so 
much life under the microtome. 

Anyway, David Ketterer defines 
his terms and partitions his thesis 
with a massive neatness, as: 

Science-fiction stories may 
be roughly grouped into three 
categories, depending upon 
the basis of the extrapolation 
involved. A writer may extra- 
polate the future conse- 
quences of present circum- 
stances, in which case he will 
probably produce sociological 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



119 




science fiction within the 
“utopia’Vdystopia range. 
(Here a footnote citing Brun- 
ner’s Zanzibar . ) Secondly, 
and this is a frequently re- 
lated category, typified by 
much of H. G. Wells’ work, 
he may extrapolate the conse- 
quences following the modifi- 
cation of an existent condi- 
tion. (Here a thousand -word 
footnote on Leiber, William 
Blake, ecology, Frank Her- 
bert, George R. Stewart, E. 
A. Poe and the Apocalypse.) 
This modification, as Kings- 
ley Amis notes, frequently 
takes the form “of some inno- 
vation in science or pseudo- 
science or pseudo-technol- 
ogy” or “some change or dis- 
turbance or local anomaly in 
physical conditions.” (Here a 
footnote identifying the Amis 
source and quoting J. O. 
Bailey on Olaf Stapledon.) 
Thirdly, the most philosophi- 
cally oriented science fiction, 
extrapolating on what we 
know in the context of our 
vaster ignorance, comes up 
with a startling donnee, or 
rationale, that puts humanity 
in a radically new perspective. 
In the second and third 
categories, the element of 
analogy becomes increasingly 
evident. Needless to say, the 
three categories overlap, and 
distinction depends upon em- 
phasis. 



I saac Asimov says: “There are 
basically three kinds of science 
fiction, and you may find any or all 
in a given story: “what if — ”, “if 
only — ”, and “if this goes on.” 
Which, I think, makes my point, 
which is not that one or the other 
form is preferable, but that we 
must not let the pressure toward 
self-complicating precision obscure 
the coexistent art of scooping it all 
up in one cupped hand. 

To do Ketterer full justice, I shall 
describe the structure and content

for Old: The Apocalyptic Imagina- 
tion, Science Fiction, and Ameri- 
can Literature. Science Fiction. A

U nder no circumstances must

A. I)., by Mack Reynolds (Bantam, 
TSe). Mack Reynolds, one of the 
best slam-bang storytellers in any 
Held, has long practiced the “if this 
goes on” variety of science fiction, 
lie is a great deal more than a 
historically minded, socially con- 
scious extrapolator; he is a guy who 
genuinely gives a damn about our 
species and what it has done, what 
it is doing to itself. He has in this 
remarkable novel evolved the com- 



mune, the alternative life style, and 
the Guaranteed Annual Income 
(which President Nixon — knowing, 
I think, that it hadn’t a chance in 
the world to pass — dared to suggest 
a few years ago) and manages to 
present the mosaic of a world al- 
most completely automated and 
computerized, in which less than 
10% of the people have jobs. 
Without forcing the gadgetry down 
our throats, he shows what it would 
be like to live through a day in a 
world in which money had disap- 
peared, in which personal property 
has, for the bulk of the population, 
no meaning, because all goods and 
services of equal quality are avail- 
able to everyone. It sounds like 
heaven and is much like those slick- 
paper magazine prophecies of life- 
in-2000, when you dial the market 
for your food, clothes, lunch or 
whatever, put your I.D. against a 
sensitized plate and have everything 
delivered almost before you can 
switch off the machine. There’s a 
General Data Bank you can call on 
for information about anything or 
anybody anywhere and each indi- 
vidual is reachable by a small por- 
table TV phone wherever he may 
be. 

Then there are the communes, 
populated by people who share a 
theme, if not a dream: singles only, 
for example; artists (this one’s 
mobile — five hundred or more 
mobile homes roaming the country- 
side); nudists; Greek revivalists 
with an emphasis on sports, drug

culture and so on. The protagonist, 
a PhD in ethnology thirsting for his 
next degree (it’s called “academi- 
cian”) is told to write his disserta- 
tion on the communes. After visit- 
ing a few he discovers that he is 
being used as a spy. Take it from 
there. Reynolds takes it through 
perplexing mystery and wild adven- 
ture (some of it most joyfully 
sexual) to a conclusion which — my 
only objection to the book — is too 
abruptly, almost naively, revealed. 
But all of it, as good social science 
fiction should, turns a blue-white 
light on what we do and are, right 
now. 

T om scortia and Chelsea Quinn 
Yarbro have come up with a 
most original anthology idea. Get a 
basic story line, hand it to two 
writers, one male, one female, 
keeping them isolated from one an- 
other, and see whether there is any 
real difference in their treatments. 
The editors did this with five care- 
fully selected couples, and them- 
selves each wrote a story. The 
couples: Joe Gores and Miriam 
Allen de Ford; Pamela Sargent and 
Michael Kurland; Sydney J. Van 
Scyoc and Reginald Bretnor; 
George Zebrowski and Tamsin 
Ashe; Chelsea Quinn Yarbro and 
Harlan Ellison; Willo Davis Roberts 
and Thomas N. Scortia. The 
editors have appended the six 
themes and I find the whole thing 
fascinating. I have long been cer- 
tain that two writers writing the 



same story can run them back to 
back in the same anthology, and 
sometimes they will be so drastically 
different that the reader will never 
know. That doesn’t quite happen 
here, but the differences between 
each two stories, built on the same 
theme, are surprising. In my 
opinion the experiment demon- 
strates that there is no significant 
difference between the males and 
the females in approach or texture. 
There are some very good yarns 
here, some so-so, none bad — and 
these comments apply evenly be- 
tween the sexes. “Vive Laquelle 
Difference ?” ask the editors in 
their introduction — and I echo, 
what difference indeed? A good 
writer is a good writer, fall the 
chromosomes where they may. The 
book’s called Two Views of Wonder 
(Ballantine $1.25).

I concede the point, modifying it 
only this much: science fiction is

apply that on many levels.

CONCLUSION 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 




When the skelter, an instant and 
inexpensive means of transporta- 
tion, first made its advent on Earth 
it was hailed as a major blessing. It 
made all men neighbors — and 
women, too — though they might 
live continents apart. A man could 
finally choose to live in a south-sea 
island paradise and commute daily 
to his work in any of the great com- 
mercial centers of his teeming and 
wealthy planet. Friends and rela- 
tives separated by vast distances 
who had resigned themselves never 
to seeing each other again were 
suddenly able to meet whenever 
and as often as they wished. 

Yet within a few short years fwo 
thirds of the Earth's population 
was destroyed and the planet was 
laid waste. Nations and govern- 
ments vanished: private lives were 
ruined. For the skelter also gave 
access to any burglar to any house- 
hold and made possible the most 
terrible wars history has known. 
Troops and weaponry could be 
moved with lightning speed and 
precision to any part of the globe — 
famines and plagues followed — un- 
til the skelter was finally brought 
under control through the inven- 
tion of the privateer, a device that 
prevented all unauthorized use of 
the skelter. The inventor of the 
privateer, Chaim Aleuker, instantly 
became the world's wealthiest man 
and around him gathered a group 
of intellectual elite, who quietly 
rule what is left of the world, for- 
saking, even damning, all that is 
past. 



125 








In this milieu also moves Hans 
Dykstra, a recuperator, whose job 
consists of sifting through the ruins 
of Earth's civilization to discover 
anything that might still be sal- 
vaged and made useful. Hans, 
however, has an illegal hobby — he 
has not rejected the past; rather, he 
wants to restore it. In this activity 
he has an influential partner, a 
blind but wealthy Arab, Mustapha 
Sharif, renowned as a poet, who 
shares Hans’s infatuation with 
what has gone before. Their alliance 
is an uneasy one — both men know 
that if their activities are discovered 
they will be ruined. 

When Chaim Aleuker, feeling 
that his governing group of intellec- 
tuals needs new brainpower, broad- 
casts to all who wish to come invita- 
tions to a treasure-hunt party — if 
they can solve a maze of clues scat- 
tered around the globe — Mustapha 
is not interested. Hans, however, 
after a fight with his wife, Dany, 
feels challenged to prove his intel- 
lectual superiority and enters the 
game. To his own surprise, he wins, 
becomes the first contestant to 
solve Aleuker’s IQ test, and finds 
himself being lionized by a gather- 
ing of Earth's finest and most influ- 
ential minds at Aleuker s palatial 
New Zealand residence. 

He is enjoying the party, meets a 
lovely seventeen-year-old innocent, 
Anneliese Schenker, and is totally 
smitten by her beauty, when dis- 
aster strikes. The f estivities are 
shattered by a Maori attack. 

Hans grabs Anneliese, rushes her 
into the nearest skelter, dials for 
home. An instant later he is there — 



and discovers his wife dead, a sui- 
cide.

H is reaction was pure reflex, 
without calculation. His left 
hand flew up to cover Anneliese’s 
eyes while his right stabbed another 
code into the skelter. 

Between one breath and the next 
they were bitterly cold. 

“Error — it’s transmission error. 
Sometimes happens — nothing is 
perfect. I think I must have drunk 
too much, terribly sorry — what a 
horrible sight to have run across by 
accident!” Gabbling. He heard her 
moan a little, but she was too over- 
come to form words. 

At least, though, here in Sweden 
it was briefly light, low sun glinting 
on the snow ridges beyond the win- 
dows. And the Erikssons’ corpses 
had safely gone to be incinerated. 
He could take her by the hand and 
lead her passive into the living 
zone, inventing frantic reasons for 



126 




the state of the house. 

Her teeth chattered, although 
the weak sunlight had raised the 
temperature behind these huge 
windows above the freezing point. 
He continued with his soothing flow 
of talk. 

“Get a fire going in a second. 
Don’t worry — I’ll take care of 
everything — ” 

On the stone hearth, logs half- 
charred, ancient ash. He thought of 
the correspondence paper in the 
study and ran for it, leaving her to 
stare wide-eyed and amazed at the 
dust. He collected the entire stack 
and came back, carrying a sort of 
torch. Damp, the paper burned 
poorly, but it did burn. Goodbye 
the sheet to be featured in my secret 
files ... In a box beside the fire- 
place he saw kindling that had 
rotted but not crumbled. 

His hands trembled. He hadn’t 
built a fire in twenty years. 

“I’ll turn on the heat in a mo- 
ment,” he promised “I don’t come 
here often, you see. People don’t 
stay in one spot these days — I ima- 
gine Aleuker told you — we like to 
follow the warmer weather because 
it’s so easy and quick to travel. In 
winter, of course, one leaves a place 
like this empty until the spring and 
heads for a warmer climate.” 

She was shaking, shaking. Near 
the fireplace stood a low stool — she 
groped her way to it and sat down. 
The kindling caught and flames 
leaped high and yellow. (In imagi- 
nation he could hear screams. Had 



the Maori extremists trapped many 
of his fellow guests in the pyre of 
Aleuker’s home? He shut off that 
line of thought.) 

O ther questions bombarded 
mini — how to conceal the 
house’s lack of electricity? With 
relief he realized : She isn 't used to 
power, but I ought not to have 
mentioned turning on the heat. The 
oil may be circulated by an electric 
pump . 

“Are there still policemen in 
your world?” Anneliese asked sud- 
denly. 

What? Hunkered down, tending 
the fire, he swiveled to face her. 

“You should tell the police about 
that dead woman,” she went on. 

“How can I?” The lie was in- 
stantly tailored. “I told you, we 
were taken there by a transmission 
error. Probably my fault, as I said, 
for having drunk too much, but 
even so — No, I might try a million 
skelter codes and never find my way 
back to the same place. I don’t even 
know what country we were in.” 
Numbed by the cold, his fingers 
ached. He spread them at the fire- 
side to rescue sensation. The chill 
referred to ghastly experiences in 
his childhood. Was it really so short 
a time ago — could the world really 
have improved so much since he 
was a ragged and half-starved waif? 

“You don’t even know what 
country?” she repeated dully after 
a pause. 

“No, of course not, The skelter

can take you anywhere in next to no 
time.” 

She pondered that for a while, 
eventually gave a nod and went on 
staring at the flames. 

“Sorry about the mess every- 
where,” he ventured. ‘‘As I said, I 
don’t corhe here very often.” 

‘‘Then why did you bring us here 
now?” 

“Uh — ” Yes, why? Quickly, 
quickly, a convincing reason de- 
spite the fog of alcohol. ‘‘Well, ob- 
viously we had to get away from 
Aleuker’s place, didn’t we? And 
what’s more — ” gravely, with an air 
of considerateness — ‘‘you haven’t 
had much chance to adapt to our 
modern world, according to what 
you told me. You’ve been over- 
whelmed by new ideas and new 
habits ever since Aleuker took you 
to New Zealand — ” 

“New Zealand?’’ A cry. She 
jolted around on her stool. 

“Why — yes! Didn’t you even 
know where you were?” 

Dumbly she shook her head. 
And forced out at length: “I 
thought maybe — the United 

States?” 

The horizons of another world, 
Hans thought. With the concept 
came a sense of fresh confidence. 
The image of Dany’s corpse, so 
brilliantly red in his imagination, 
was a warning that the universe was 
poised to come crashing on his 
head. There was no real sense of 
loss involved in his memory of 
her — he had never actually loved 



his wife, just wanted to have a wife 
in an age when so many men were 
resigned to bachelorhood. 

But if no one apart from this ig- 
norant girl so far knew that he had 
seen Dany dead, it shouldn’t be too 
hard to wriggle out from under the 
consequences. 

The first step must be to mislead 
her out of understanding what she 
had seen. He drew a deep breath 
and rose to his feet. 

Excusing himself, he went to in- 
spect the heating system. 

B y a minor miracle, it was self- 
feeding, with a compressed air 
tank to start the process that re- 
quired only a dozen firm strokes on 
a plunger, like an overgrown camp- 
ing stove. A yellowish smoky flame 
answered the application of his 
lighter, turning blue as the burner 
scorched itself free of dust. When 
he returned to the living zone the 
registers were already uttering the 
first warm air. 

Pausing in the doorway, he 
looked around with a grimace. 

“I should apologize. I’d no idea 
the place would get so filthy in such 
a short time. It must be very dif- 
ferent here, by the way, than where 
you hail from.” 

‘‘Where is here?” she asked tre- 
mulously. 

A brief hesitation. Safe? Well, 
worth risking to gain her confi- 
dence. 

‘‘We’ve come to Sweden.”

nod. The gamble had paid off. For 
her, no doubt, it was a name on an 
old map, corners ragged from the 
attentions of termites, lacking ref- 
erents. 

She said, “No, not very different. 
Also at Festeburg nothing could be 
left for more than a day or two with- 
out becoming very dirty — Is that 
snow?” 

She was gazing at the windows. 

“Snow? Yes, of course it is.” 

“I heard about it. But I never 
saw any before.” 

Hans relaxed so violently he al- 
most gasped. It was going to be 
easier than he had dared to dream 
to convince this youngster he was 
telling the truth about Dany. His 
mind fermented with ideas: leave 
her here, afraid to use the skelter 
without a companion, trapped for 
as long as proved necessary to sort 
things out. The apartment held no 
evidence of his illegal trips, not 
even his darkroom. He could ask 
Karl Bonetti to confirm that Dany 
had made scores of suicide threats 
without putting any of them into 
practice. He could arrange to have 
his hallway redecorated so Anne- 
liese wouldn’t recognize anything — 
or better yet, he could move to an- 
other country, another continent. 

It could all be done in forty-eight 
hours. 

Too bad that he would have to 
sacrifice the would-have-been star 
entry in his secret files — but at the 
very edge of his mind hovered the 
idea that from now on he might not 



be paying so much attention to his 
hobby. 

This girl Anneliese — given the 
way she’d been brought up she 
might well be susceptible to the an- 
cient notion that marriage was a 
woman’s only security. What would 
she desire more than security in this 
weird, unfamiliar world? 

To have a young bride . Ho, 
ho! It had to be a decade or more 
since a man in his thirties had 
married a girl of seventeen! 

H e took a frenzied grip on him- 
self, aware that he was still a 
little drunk despite the sobering 
shock of seeing Aleuker’s home 
attacked and then finding Dany. It 
was too soon to let his dreams run 
away with him. 

He said, “Anneliese — dear — I 
think you look tired. Should I pre- 
pare a bed for you? There’s a room 
you can sleep in over there.” 

He pointed toward the child’s 
room, forgetful that he had left its 
door ajar and the weak sunlight 
would reveal the toys, books and 
scattered clothes. She smiled and 
turned her head and instantly was 
bewildered. 

“You — you are married? You 
have children?” 

Invention, quickly! Something 
that can't be used against me . 

His tone was so smooth it as- 
tonished him as he replied, “Ah, 
this is my old family home. You 
heard that there was — well, what 
we call the Blowup? And after that

came plagues and epidemics.” 

A nod. ‘‘I don’t understand 
much about what happened — but I 
was told. Things must have been 
very terrible.” 

“Yes, they were. Well, I had a 
sister. She died. And my parents 
are also dead. I — ah— I never felt 
inclined to change anything in this 
house — if you see what I mean.” 

“I think I understand.” 

“But it was a long time ago. It’s 
foolish to live with the dead past. 
Now that you are here, I have an 
excuse to clear away what I kept as 
mementos — no, sit down. Stay by 
the fire.” Pushing her gently, one 
hand on her soft warm shoulder. 
Somehow his fingers remained in 
contact with her and they were 
looking at each other, eyes directly 
into eyes. 

A stillness grew. 

“Poor little girl,” Hans said at 
last. “To be cast adrift in this 
strange world — it must be awful. 
Trust me, though, and I’ll see that 
you come to no harm.” 

Unexpectedly her bright dark 
eyes spilled tears. 

“Thank you, sir,” she muttered 
almost inaudibly. 

“Call me Hans.” 

“Yes — if you don’t mind? Yes, it 
is a fearful new world for me and I 
know so little about it. I can’t even 
find my way around, let alone make 
a living for myself. It is very kind of 
you to show such charity. You will 
be blessed.” 

Upon which, with a sudden with- 



drawal into herself, she freed her 
arm from his touch and returned to 
her stool, gazing once more into the 
tire. 

T he house held many things that 
might contradict his lies. Per- 
sonal letters — the rotting food from 
the deep freeze, clearly stamped for 
consumption at the latest some 
forty years ago — irreplaceable 

newspapers, which he had to do 
away with because, though ignorant 
of Swedish, Anneliese might read 
the dates on them, too. 

It hurt him — it agonized him — to 
see these precious relics destroyed. 
But he drove himself to the task, 
mindful of Dany’s corpse waiting 
for him at home. 

Other priceless relics of the past 
he destroyed for fear they might 
lead Anneliese to ask him later 
why, if he had been born in Bel- 
gium, his “family home” should be 
in Sweden. The little girl’s books, 
punctiliously signed- — her name 
had been Greta — had to go, though 
not her clothes, or not all of them, 
for she had been tall for her age, 
while Anneliese was slight for hers, 
so some of them might come in use- 
ful. Doubtless at Festeburg with its 
limited resources, long before the 
same thing happened in the larger 
world, one had had to be content 
with other people’s cast-offs . 

He breathed a vast sigh of relief 
on discovering that the girl had 
abandoned her stool for a long sofa 
and, lying on it, had dozed off.

That made his job far easier. 

The deceased master of the 
house had owned a large wardrobe. 
He had been taller than Hans and 
rather fatter, but providentially 
took the same size in shoes. Warm 
in musty thick winter garments, 
Hans was able to trudge outside 
with those few articles he did not 
want to leave lying around for 
Anneliese to inquire about, yet 
dared not send to the incinerators 
for fear they would survive the 
flames and be recognized as an- 
tique. Most of these were luxury 
items, chiefly cosmetic jars and per- 
fume bottles. He could have smash- 
ed them, but the noise might have 
woken Anneliese. 

The ground was frozen far too 
hard for him to dig a hole. For the 
time being he had to be content 
with hiding the things in the snow. 

Returning, bitterly cold, he found 
bedding and made up the child’s 
bed for Anneliese — she was short 
enough to find it tolerable, he 
judged. Then he carried her from 
the living zone and tucked her in, 
removing only her shoes. She barely 
stirred, so deep was her sleep by 
now. 

His mind was filled with com- 
peting emotions — a kind of frus- 
trated tenderness, such as he might 
feel if he actually were putting to 
bed his own child, and a cold and 
calculating plan for the future, a 
tangled skein of deceit climaxing in 
arson . 

At the edge of hearing lurked 



small sounds — trickle, splash . 
What in the world? Oh, of course. 
A pipe had frost-fractured in the 
main bathroom. The toilet pan, he 
found, had been frozen, predic- 
tably enough — now a wedge of ice 
bobbed in it as water dribbled 
down from the flushing valve. 

But the Erikssons had been care- 
ful people. It took Hans only 
minutes to locate a tool kit in a 
kitchen drawer. After making the 
repair, crudely but effectively, he 
inspected all the other piping he 
could find and concluded that there 
was no risk of further leaks. 

Now, before leaving — what else? 
Obviously a light for Anneliese if 
she awoke while he was gone and 
the short sub-arctic day was over. 
Festeburg had never accepted elec- 
tricity, so she would be used to 
candles. Here were several, wicks 
damp and fizzing, all colors of the 
rainbow, meant for tete-a-tete din- 
ner parties, not real illumination — 
but never mind. He set one by the 
bed, with matches that (he tried 
one) still struck well after all these 
years. 

That, and a quick note telling 
her not to worry, that he would be 
back soon, would have to be that. 
He dared not delay too long about 
reporting Dany’s death, even 
though the Maori attack on Aleu- 
ker’s home would make it extremely 
improbable that anybody had noted 
the exact time of his departure 
from New Zealand. He had a good 
cover story, too — he would say that 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



131 




even as he fled he had realized he 
didn’t want to confront Dany after 
their disagreement, so he had made 
for the Gozo outlet instead and 
spent a while debating with himself 
as to whether he should ask Karl 
Bonetti to examine her and pro- 
nounce on her sanity. Then, having 
decided against the idea, he had 
finally made for home to dis- 
cover . 

Yes, the claim would carry con- 
viction, but only if he hurried now. 

He propped up his note beside 
the candle and on impulse kissed 
Anneliese’s forehead. She half- 
smiled in her sleep. As he turned 
away his heart ached with yearning 
and delight.

— Mustapha Sharif 

H e walked straight past the 
disgusting ruin of Dany, head- 
ing for the phone. He dialed the 
police emergency code and waited. 
Sometimes the phones here worked 
and sometimes they didn’t. 

This time they worked. A voice 
said grumpily, “Yes, police.” 
“Please send somebody here 
right away,” Hans said, his voice 



shaking just a little. “My wife — 
she’s dead — ” 

“What happened?” 

“She must have killed herself 
while I was out. Here, make a note 
of my skelter code. I’ll disconnect 
the privateer.” 

Less than two minutes later a 
uniformed sergeant appeared in the 
skelter, holding up a portable re- 
corder. He said, “Repeat after me 
please: I, Hans Dykstra — do of my 
own free will — consent to the use of 
my skelter code — by law-enforce- 
ment officers — and understand — 
that on completion of these in- 
quiries — I may require another 
code confidential from the authori- 
ties. Thank you.” 

He stepped into the hallway, his 
eyes fixed in dismay on Dany. A 
moment later another policemen 
appeared and then after a slightly 
longer delay a harassed-looking 
man carrying a medical kit and im- 
mediately followed by a photog- 
rapher. 

The second policeman to arrive 
identified himself as Chief In- 
spector Vanzetti. He was a portly 
man with tired eyes, his summer- 
weight uniform patched with sweat, 
although it was locally winter. 

“Tell me exactly what happen- 
ed,” he invited. 

Hans licked his lips. “I — uh — I 
guess I found her about two or 
three minutes before I was able to 
call up. I had to go into the bath- 
room and vomit. The shock, you 
understand. And — well, I wasn’t 



132

feeling too good in any case. You 
may have heard Chaim Aleuker 
held a treasure hunt?” 

Vanzetti’s eyes widened. “You 
were at it? Hmm — how come you 
got away with a whole skin?” 

“Did it turn out to be bad?” 
“Twelve deaths that we’ve heard 
about, and most of his house de- 
stroyed — How did you get away?” 
Hans felt his cheeks start to 
burn. He wasn’t sorry. A little 
visible embarrassment would sup- 
port his story well. 

“I hate to admit it, but — Well, 
you see. I’d been there three hours, 
maybe four, and I’d drunk a lot 
and — when the shooting started I 
just plain ran like hell. I’m not 
sure, but I think I was probably the 
first person to think of making for 
the skelter.” 

“That’s interesting,” Vanzetti 
muttered. He consulted the watch 
on his wrist: no ordinary watch, as 
Hans’s expert eyes informed him, 
but a classic Seiko Worldtime, the 
like of which had not been built 
since the Blowup. “That means you 
must have left New Zealand at least 
an hour and a half ago, doesn’t it?” 
"I didn’t come straight here.” 
“Why not? And where did you 
go?” 

“I didn’t come here because 
Dany and I had had a row. I’m a 
photographer in my spare time. 
She was going on this treasure 
hunt. She didn’t tell me who the 
host was and I assumed it was one 
of her abominable friends and 



planned to stay home and develop 
some film I was specially proud of. 
She barged into my darkroom and 
ruined the film and I decided — ” 
He hesitated. “I decided to go to 
the party myself to even things up. 
Now I’m terribly ashamed of my- 
self. But I swear I never dreamed 
she might do this — ” 

He gestured at the corpse, 
around which the doctor and the 
photographer were prowling like 
carrion birds. 

‘‘You had no idea j at all?” 
Vanzetti probed. 

‘‘She had threatened to kill 
herself,” Hans muttered. ‘‘But 
she’d never tried it. I had consulted 
a psychiatrist named Karl Bonetti 
about her and he — Oh, that’s 
where I went. That’s why I didn’t 
come straight home. My wife’s 
mental condition had been on my 
mind during the party and, as I 
said, I was rather drunk when I left 
and — well, for no real conscious 
reason it struck me as a good idea 
to go to see Bonetti at Gozo. I know 
the code for the public outlet there 
nearly as well as I know my own. 
Dr. Bonetti is an old friend of 
mine.” 

“Did you actually see him?” 

“No, I wandered around brood- 
ing for a while and eventually de- 
cided it was worth making one 
more try to patch up the row. So I 
came home and — and found her.” 

“Chief,” the sergeant said, “it’s 
suicide. Not a shred of doubt. She 
used this.” He held up a bright 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



133 




oblong partly smeared with dry 
blood. “An old-fashioned double- 
edged razor. She cut her thumb 
and finger with it while she was 
slashing her wrists.” 

Vanzetti nodded. “Doc, do you 
agree?” 

The doctor grunted what might 
have been an affirmative and went 
on studying the corpse with instru- 
ments from his kit. 

“How long since she died, would 
you say?” Vanzetti probed. 

“Oh — not less than three hours, 
not more than five. I’m just check- 
ing to see what she took before- 
hand: a stimulant pill or two, I 
imagine, and possibly some liquor, 
too. Ah, here we are.” He straight- 
ened, holding up a little glass tube 
containing some chemical mixture 
that had turned color at two 
levels — blue and green respectively. 

“Yes, she was both drunk and 
doped. A mix that could have done 
awful things to her head.” 

“You said,” Vanzetti went on, 
turning to Hans again, “you’d con- 
sulted Dr. Bonetti about your 
wife?” 

“Ah — yes, more than once. He 
said her suicide threats were so 
much noise, an attempt to make 
me pay more attention to her.” 
Hans hesitated. “It’s — uh — it’s not 
much of a secret among our friends 
that there had been friction be- 
tween us this past year. I’d better 
make a clean breast of that. You’re 
bound to be told sooner or later.” 
“Oh, I don’t believe our inquiries 



need be very extensive, given what 
you just heard. Naturally there 
must be an inquest, but there’s no 
call to worry overmuch about that. 
It’ll be largely a formal matter.” 
Vanzetti shook his head dolefully. 
“A terrible thing, this. Terrible. 
Now, about Aleuker’s party — w-ho 
can confirm you were there at the 
relevant time?” 

“Well, Aleuker himself — ” 

“No, I’m afraid not. He’s dead.” 
“What?” 

“He was shot. The first of the 
dead to be identified. The news had 
just come in by satellite as I left 
headquarters. A terrible loss for us 
all.” 

Hans folded his hands into fists 
and stood shaking for a moment 
until Vanzetti prompted him: 
“Anybody else?” 

“Uh — ” Hans forced his hands 
open again and rubbed his fore- 
head giddily. “Well, Dr. Satamori, 
Dr. Pech — and I also had a few 
words with Dr. Ingrid Castelnuovo 
and—” 

“That’ll do very well. I shall have 
to ask for a word of confirmation 
just for the record, but nothing 
more.” 

“All done,’’ the doctor said, 
putting away his gear. “We can 
finish the job at the morgue.” 
“Good, thank you.’’ Vanzetti 
hesitated. “Mr. Dykstra, would 
you rather come with us now and 
make a statement — or wait until 
you’ve recovered a bit from the 
shock?” 



134 



GALAXY 




“Oh, I’d rather get it out of the 
way.” Hans sighed. “I wouldn’t 
want to try and catch some sleep, 
the state I’m in. I’d have night- 
mares — ” 

E verything went smoothly, as 
designed. Make the statement; 
agree to attend the inquest tomor- 
row morning; call his headquarters 
office to say he wouldn’t be avail- 
able for work; hear that Boris Peck 
had been among the lucky ones 
who survived the bloodbath at 
Aleuker’s. Pech was in a hospital, 
but conscious and willing to con- 
firm that Hans had been present. 

No least hint from anybody of 
anything but genuine sympathy 
with a man who had tragically lost 
that ultra-precious commodity, a 
legally married wife. 

“And will you go back home 
now?” Vanzetti asked solicitously. 
"Or would you rather spend some 
time elsewhere — with friends per- 
haps?” 

Hans shook his head. “I’d rather 
be alone. I guess maybe I shall go 
call on one or two people who knew 
Dany particularly well, break the 
news to them personally. If you 
can’t reach me at home, that’s 
what I’ll be doing, but I shan’t stay 
away for more than a few hours at a 
time.” 

‘‘Oh, it’s most unlikely we’ll 
want to contact you,” Vanzetti 
said. “Just as long as you’re on time 
at the inquest. Goodbye for the mo- 
ment, then.” 



Hans forced a mechanical smile 
and headed for the skelter. At its 
threshold he stopped dead. 

“Is something wrong?” Vanzetti 
called. 

“Yes, I just realized something is 
horribly wrong. It’s getting through 
to me. I felt all numb at first — I 
guess maybe I threw up my emo- 
tions, in a weird kind of way. But I 
shall have to move house. I mean, if 
next month, or next year, I sudden- 
ly think: I punched this code and 
there was — was Dany — ” He swal- 
lowed loudly. “Do you know any- 
thing about what turns people into 
stucks? Because I just got this flash 
about becoming one myself if I 
don’t move away from Valletta.” 

“Hmm — yes, I can well believe 
it,” Vanzetti said. “You ought to 
talk to your friend Dr. Bonetti 
about that, don’t you think?” 

“Yes. Yes, you’re quite right — 
and I shall.” 

But not right now. Not today. 
Today was for being at Anneliese’s 
side when she awoke, symbol of the 
stability and reassurance she craved 
and had not had from Chaim 
Aleuker. 

Also It would be for figuring out 
where to make his new home, out of 
all the thousands of places to which 
the skelter could take him. 

With his new wife.

— Mustapha Sharif 

D rowsing at last after thinking 
long and hard about what he 
had said concerning Aleuker’s 
party, Mustapha awoke to the 
frantic shout of Ali at his bedroom 
door. 

“Effendi! It is Dr. Satamori who 
came back! His head is cut and he 
is bleeding.” 

Mustapha was instantly wide 
awake, wondering whether it was 
time for him to admit that he be- 
lieved in premonitions. He called 
out orders for Satamori to receive 
medical attention and, minutes 
later, joined him in the Room of 
Flowers. Satamori lay stretched on 
a hand-carved couch, eyes closed, 
face a mask of pain, clothes ragged 
and smeared with dirt and blood. 
“Fred — what happened to you?” 
Wincing now and then as a boy 
armed with a box bearing the sign 
of the Red Crescent attended to his 
injuries, Satamori forced out a 
brief account of the disaster that 



had overtaken Aleuker’s party. 
Mustapha hissed in dismay. 

“You think Chaim himself is 
among the dead?” 

“I don’t think — I know. I saw 
him killed by a ricocheting slug. It 
tore him open and spilled his guts 
on the floor. Like ripping a paper 
sack of butcher’s meat!” 

“We have lost, then, a very pre- 
cious man,” Mustapha said heavily. 

“Oh, don’t strike poses,” Sata- 
mori snapped. “I know you de- 
tested him. You were sure he was 
always doing absolutely the wrong 
thing.” 

“That’s untrue,” Mustapha said, 
feeling for and settling himself on a 
stool he could draw close to the 
couch. “A man who has once seen 
the correct thing to do — and has 
done it — must be regarded differ- 
ently from those who have never 
thought of anything new. At any 
moment he might have done some- 
thing just as useful as inventing the 
privateer. Now that chance has 
vanished forever.” 

“I’m too sick and tired to bother 
with your doubletalk.” Satamori 
sighed. “But thank you anyway for 
taking me in.” 

“My friend, I am flattered that 
you came to me. Did you not have 
the chance to tell others they would 
be welcome here?” 

“No — no chance at all. There 
was panic. It started immediately 
the Maoris attacked. In fact — oh, 
it’s ironical in a way — the first 
person to arrive was the first to turn 



136 



GALAXY 




and run. I mean, apart from those 
who were invited to show up ahead 
of time, like Boris Pech and my- 
self.” 

“So? You mean you lost all bene- 
fit from this treasure hunt? You 
don’t know who it was who first un- 
riddled your clues and found his 
way to Chaim’s house?” 

“It was a recuperator named 
Hans Dykstra, who lives in Val- 
letta, I believe. I was lying flat on 
the floor along with everybody else 
because one of the first shots 
smashed a wall-high window and 
there was glass flying all over the 
room. But I turned my head away 
and that’s how I happened to see 
him rush for the skelter. And not 
by himself, either. Did you hear 
about this girl Chaim rescued a 
while ago from the wilds of Brazil? 
Dykstra was talking to her all by 
himself for most of the evening. 
They were sitting right near the 
skelter and he literally dragged her 
with him. It would have been funny 
if it hadn’t been so tragic.” 

A long silence followed, during 
which the boy with the first-aid kit 
completed his task and left the 
room. 

Eventually Mustapha said, “Rest 
now, Frederick. Stay and sleep 
where you are. Ali will make sure 
that someone watches by you until 
you waken. After a rest you will 
certainly feel better.” 

“Thank you,” Satamori mum- 
bled. He rolled on his side and 
passed out almost on the instant. 

WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



I t was not until he was safely 
clear of the Room of Flowers 
that Mustapha dared give way to 
the sense of terror that had ex- 
ploded in his belly on hearing Sata- 
mori’s news. 

Hans Dykstra — first to arrive at 
Aleuker’s party! Singled out as 
though he were the computer- 
chosen winner of a lottery. 

Of all the billion people left on 
Earth, no one more dangerous 
could have been successful in the 
treasure hunt. 

Worse yet, he had escaped — had 
started the panic, if Satamori could 
be believed — and had dragged 
along with him this girl nicknamed 
Barbara. 

Something had to be done at 
once, for security’s sake. 

Would he have gone home? Logi- 
cally, yes — but to a chilly welcome. 
Mustapha had met and evaluated 
Dany. Chatting with her once had 
given him a complete picture of her 
personality. If her husband came 
back from a party held by some- 
body as famous as Chaim Aleu- 
ker — which she would doubtless 
have wanted to attend herself — and 
brought with him a girl in her 
teens, allegedly very pretty, hell 
and all its devils would be let loose. 

So if he had any shred of his wits 
about him, Hans would not have 
gone back to Malta. Where? 

Ah. Yes, quite conceivably. That 
code, after all, would have been at 
the forefront of his mind, ready to 
hand when the attack began. And 

137 




on that skelter there was no priva- 
teer and . 

It would take only a few minutes 
to confirm his guess. Mustapha 
hastened up the staircase of his 
tallest minaret, entered the secret 
room containing his third skelter, 
put on his climatized clothing and 
punched the code for the Eriksson 
house at Umea. 

H ans had been so sure — so ab- 
solutely certain — that there 
would be no one in the Swedish 
house apart from Anneliese, that 
for the first several seconds after his 
return he thought only of trivia. 
The sun had gone down after the 
brief northern winter day, but the 
place was warm. Therefore the 
heating system must be working 
okay because the fire had died to 
embers. Beside it in the gloom sat a 
cloaked figure, logically Anneliese 
wrapped in a blanket. He hoped 
she had not woken so long before 
he arrived that she was frightened. 

The last chunk of a log slipped 
on the hearth and uttered a spurt of 
bright yellow flame. The light 
revealed that the person waiting for 
him was not Anneliese. 

He exploded with mingled rage 
and terror. 

“Mustapha! What the hell are 
you doing here? You’ve broken our 
compact.” 

“It is not my custom to resort to 
the tu quoque,” Mustapha mur- 
mured. “If it were I might well say 
that you not only broke it, but 



smashed it into fragments and 
trampled those fragments into 
dust. Must I remind you that I laid 
it down as a condition of supplying 
you with illegal codes that you 
should never under any circum- 
stances bring another person to one 
of these abandoned homes?” 

“What other person am I sup- 
posed to have brought?” Hans 
cried, knowing even as he voiced 
the words that they were futile. 

Mustapha’s tongue clucked. 
“Though I’m blind I am not un- 
aware of what goes on around me. 
You of all people should have rea- 
lized that by now. I scented the girl 
the moment I left the skelter, over 
and through the smoke of the fire 
which doubtless you built for her. 
And, by the way, keep your voice 
down. She slept contentedly 
throughout my inspection of her, 
but she is near to waking and a 
loud noise may rouse her.” 

“Your — inspection?” Hans forc- 
ed out, advancing on Mustapha 
with fists clenched. “You’ve been 
feeling her?” 

“Oh, I was right — I sense jea- 
lousy,” Mustapha said. “I was un- 
aware that she had become your 
property. I have no eyesight, man, 
but my fingertips — you saw — are 
delicate enough to stroke the full 
length of a spider’s web and leave it 
unbroken. You think to touch a girl 
is to maul her, ravish her — I think 
of my touch as having to be lighter 
than a glance. She did not even 
turn over, let alone wake up .

How old is she, this girl whom 
Chaim retrieved from the Brazilian 
sertao? Seventeen? Eighteen?” 
“Who told you — ” Hans’s voice 
failed him in mid-question. 

“I was right again,” Mustapha 
said, “You imagined your depar- 
ture with her from Aleuker’s home 
was unobserved. You are too 
commonplace, too interchangeable 
a person to sense that unique recog- 
nizes unique. I am not surprised 
that you found your way to Chaim’s 
party. I am surprised that Chaim 
and his friends imagined that 
people like you could save the 
world, frozen as you are into the 
mold of the past. You’re like a vam- 
pire — one of the undead compelled 
to spend half his life in a coffin.” 

B lood was roaring in Hans’s 
ears and the room swayed and 
swirled. He said, “Okay, so some- 
one saw me leave Aleuker’s with 
her, but I may well have saved her 
life by bringing her here and — ” 
“Here? Instead of Valletta? Most 
people in the grip of panic think at 
once of going home.” Mustapha’s 
tone was gentle enough, but con- 
tempt rode the edge of his words as 
light may ride the sharpness of a 
steel blade. “Not, of course, that 
you could have made it clear to 
your wife that your intention was 
simply to save the life of a poor 
friendless girl — ” 

Grasping at a straw, Hans 
rapped, “Of course not. You’ve 
met her, you can imagine the scene 



she would have created.” 

Mustapha shook his head. 
“Wrong reason — and dishonest 
with it.” 

“What?” 

“I can read you more clearly 
than you, with your good eyesight, 
can read one of the books I’ve sold 
you.” Mustapha rose, reaching out 
one hand to the brick side of the 
chimney that swallowed the small 
remaining trace of smoke from the 
fire. “You could have convinced 
Dany you’d brought the girl home 
to save her life, if that had been the 
truth — but it was not. I can hear 
the processes of your imagination. I 
can put them into words, even into 
English words, though I would be 
more precise and cruel in Arabic. I 
see your whole plan laid out before 
me, like a map, like a carven stela 
from Luxor that my fingers have 
grown acquainted with. I say this is 
what you intend — ” 

He drew himself bolt upright and 
his blind eyes seemed to shine 
dazzlingly into Hans’s. 

“I say your plan goes like this. 
You have by chance been brought 
together with a girl who is lost in 
the modern world. Aleuker, a busy 
man with more friends, more 
women, more preoccupations than 
he could cope with, neglected her 
when he found her childhood con- 
ditioning had scarred her mind too 
deeply for her to be turned into a 
decent citizen of today’s world. 

“But you have the time and the 
urge. Hating your wife, possessing 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE

her not as a person and a partner 
but as a trophy, a prize that all too 
many men these days can never 
aspire to, you suddenly realize 
there’s a chance for you to supplant 
her. What likelier target than a girl 
who is lonely and miserable and 
frightened? In a few months, grati- 
tude — in a year or so, divorce — 
Dany like any other woman can 
always find an eager youth wanting 
to share her bed — and after that re- 
marriage. Legal binding marriage 
to a teenage girl who’s been care- 
fully prevented from involving her- 
self with anybody except Hans 
Dykstra. It won’t be love, but you 
never understood what love is. You 
want to buy this child as though she 
were a slave and bind her to you 
with intangible chains.” 

The diagnosis was too terribly 
accurate for Hans to answer at 
once. He gulped air, swayed, 
blinked, at last found his voice 
again. 

“You dare to say that to me? 
You, who’ve done the same and 
worse to kids from all over the 
world? Spent your time and money 
hunting for orphans, boys as well as 
girls as long as they’re pretty and 
bright, seduced them into your bed 
and imprisoned them in your home 
and taught them just those jobs 
they can’t make use of anywhere 
else if they do decide to try and 
escape from you? What do you pay 
for the children you enslave?” 

“I pay what you can’t because 
you’ve never had any,” Mustapha 



said and the words quavered un- 
expectedly. A glint from the fire 
showed, bewilderingly, that tears 
had gathered in his sightless eyes. 
Suddenly they spilled over and ran 
down his face. 

“What? What are you talking 
about?” 

“I pay love.” The poet gathered 
himself again, brushed at his itch- 
ing cheeks. “I have never bought 
any of my proteges. Of either sex. I 
have kissed and embraced and 
comforted those who never before 
in their lives were touched by an- 
other person except to be punched 
or slapped. I have broken my heart 
so many times it is held together 
with rivets like a shattered porce- 
lain bowl, because I have always let 
go those I loved with the depths of 
my being when they said it was time 
for them to become themselves, to 
be individuals and not to depend on 
me any more. Compared to what 
you plan to make of this girl — a 
bunch of reflexes, a machine whose 
buttons you can press at will — I am 
sinless and without reproach.” 

The world turned red around 
Hans. Without volition he snatched 
at a poker lying on the side of the 
hearth, hot but not too hot to 
grasp, and used it to silence that 
accusing tongue.

— Or so they said who are no 
longer with us. 

Likewise, however, 

"To be out of sight is to be out of 
mind, ” 

— I never knew which proverb to 
believe. 

You whom I love 

Stepped through the skelter 
yesterday. 

— Now I have had proof that 
both are true. 

— Mustapha Sharif 

“Who? Hans! What— Oh, 
God!” 

An incredible confusion of 
slump, cry, run, exclaim, moan. It 
all happened in a time when Hans 
was out of touch with the uni- 
verse — it sandwiched together, 
compressed, declined to be sepa- 
rated again. 

But that was a moment ago. At 
this moment Anneliese stood at the 
door of the room where she had 
been sleeping, staring at what the 
wan firelight showed, petrified by 
horror. Her dress was crumpled 
and, in a sense, so was her face, for 
she had been lying on a fold in the 
pillows and a deep dent marked the 
skin of her left cheek. 

Nobody, no matter how dull- 
witted, could have failed to add 
together a scene like this: prone by 
the hearth, an unconscious 
stranger, dark blood trickling out 



of his hair, and Hans still clutching 
the poker he had struck out with. 

He remained in a daze until she 
managed to force out the all-impor- 
tant question. 

“Have you — killed him?” 

“No — “ Hans’s mind seemed to 
rush back to normal operation. He 
could think again and he discover- 
ed a cluster of excuses full-blown 
and ready for use. 

“Who is he?” Anneliese asked. 

“I’ve no idea. But I know what 
he is.” 

She advanced a pace toward 
him, hands clenched, jaw-muscles 
lumping as though to restrain a 
scream, and waited for him to 
elaborate. 

Now I've got to pile yet another 
untruth atop the crazy pyramid I’ve 
already erected. Why? Why? How 
did I get tangled in this lunatic 
mess? I lost my temper, that's all — 
first with Dany, then with Musta- 
pha, both times with complete jus- 
tification. And all of a sudden it 
turns out I'm snarled up as though 
I've been wrapped in barbed wire! 

Was I to know so many people 
would notice me leaving Aleuker’s 
that Mustapha would get to hear in 
a matter of hours? 

Oh, maybe I should have 
guessed. A fter all, I bought noto- 
riety, didn 't I? By being the person 
who won Boris Pech his bet .

being. That's not like me. It isn't — 
I'm sure it isn't in my real nature to 
do that ! 

Sol'll be justified if I put the best 
possible light on things. Ill atone 
later. When I've straightened 
matters out. After the inquest on 
Dany. A fter finding a place to live a 
long, long way away from Malta. I 
can just disappear from the aware- 
ness of my friends. My colleagues 
at work must be informed, natu- 
rally — but I can lose the people who 
knew me with Dany. I can start 
over somehow, I can — 

T he rush of thought had to break 
off. Anneliese was staring at 
him, still waiting for the reply to 
her last question. 

He fumbled for the proper 
words. 

‘Tm dreadfully sorry about this. 
But I imagine you’ve been told 
there are still criminals in our 
modern world?” 

“Y-yes — ” In a voice as faint as 
autumn wind. 

“This is one. Of the worst kind. 
What we call a code-breaker. A 
person who figures out how to use a 
private skelter and sneaks in to rob 
people’s homes and, if he’s caught, 
to kill the person who catches 
him.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Do you think I’d use this — ” 
brandishing the poker — “if I 
weren t? 

“I thought I heard you talking 
together,” she ventured. 



“Well — of course! I wouldn’t 
have knocked him down on sight, 
would I? But when he couldn’t give 
a satisfactory account of his pres- 
ence there was only one sensible 
course of action.” 

“I — ” She shook her head. “I 
must have misunderstood. I be- 
lieved that because of something 
Chaim invented, this didn’t happen 
any more. Didn’t he devise what 
they call a privateer?” 

Hans cursed silently. Ignorant 
this- girl might be — she was in no 
sense stupid. 

“Yes, but I’m talking about the 
sort of burglar who can get around 
a privateer. What one man can in- 
vent another can evade. It’s very 
rare, but it does happen now and 
then.” 

“I— I see.” 

“There are always flaws in the 
best systems. You get transmission 
errors, for example, like the one 
that — ’’ He interrupted himself, 
momentarily experiencing a re- 
newal of his former panic. The less 
often Anneliese was reminded 
about the “anonymous” dead wo- 
man, the better. “But I’ve got to 
get you out of here,” he finished. 

“Why?” 

“Because where one code-break- 
er gets in another may follow. Very 
often they work in gangs. If this one 
doesn’t report back in half an hour 
or so his confederates may very 
likely come to see what’s happen- 
ed — You poor girl! It must be ab- 
solutely terrible to have seen so

much of what’s bad in today’s 
world and so little of what’s good. I 
do promise you, it is possible to be 
happy and enjoy yourself and make 
plans for the future and see them 
fulfilled. 1 want to give you that. 
You deserve it.” 

In memory, an echo of Musta- 
pha’s accusations — but he stifled 
it. 

“Where will you take me, then?” 

“To a safe place. For just long 
enough to sort this out. I’ll have to 
tell the police, of course, and then 
I'll have to have the skelter re- 
coded. It takes a few hours. I’m so 
sorry, I really am. Because what I 
most want to do is help you. You — 
ah — you don’t mind my wanting to 
help you?” 

All the color drained from her 
cheeks. 

“Hans, where would I be if there 
wasn’t somebody to help me? I 
could be dead. Couldn’t I?” 

Hans opened his arms just in 
time as she rushed at him and 
buried her face in his shoulder and 
convulsed into sobs. 

There followed an unmeasured 
period, during which she wept and 
he caressed her back through one 
thin layer of cloth and dreamed of 
the time when the cloth would no 
longer be there. How long would it 
take to persuade her by slow de- 
grees that it was okay for her to 
strip in his presence? 

Too soon. Too soon ! Keep your 
head, Hans Dykstra, and don't 
push your luck . 



E ventually he drew back from 
her and murmured something 
about having to hurry. She nodded 
pliantly. 

“Just to be on the safe side,” he 
said. “I guess I’d better tie this vil- 
lian up so he can’t get away before 
the police collect him — ” 

“You will not send for them at 
once? They could be waiting here 
when his confederates come, 
couldn’t they?” 

Once more Hans chided himself 
for underestimating this girl’s 
native wit. How to get around that 
little problem? 

“Ah, but suppose the police and 
the other code-breakers arrive to- 
gether. You could be involved in 
another gunfight. You just escaped 
from one at Aleuker’s — surely you 
don’t want to risk another? Just do 
as I say and everything will work 
out fine.” 

She raised no more objections 
and within another five minutes 
they entered the skelter together 
and he pressed the code for a Way 
of Life refuge he had once visited in 
Bali. Anneliese might be disturbed 
at finding herself among committed 
heathens — still, the place had three 
great advantages. The monks and 
nuns took in anybody, gave help 
and never asked too many ques- 
tions — they were always extremely 
busy and maintained no records, 
preferring to get on with their real 
work and forget about what hap- 
pened yesterday — and very few 
people there spoke more than a

smattering of English, let alone 
Flemish or Plattdutsh. 



T hey were received at the skelter 
door by a smiling, thirtyish 
woman garlanded with flowers — 
flowers were also braided into her 
black hair. Apart from that she 
wore only a sort of kilt secured with 
a belt of woven leather from which 
dangled a small pouch. Anneliese’s 
fingers cramped painfully on 
Hans’s arm as she realized that by 
her standards the woman was 
shamelessly unclad. 

He murmured reassuringly, 
“You probably find this hard to 
believe — but you’re looking at a 
nun.’’ 

She turned wide disbelieving eyes 
to him. “A — a nun?” she repeated. 

“What else do you call someone 
who has decided to dedicate her 
existence to helping others because 
of what she believes?” 

“I — ” Anneliese’s voice failed 
her. Just as well — it would have 
complicated matters beyond bear- 
ing to try to fill in the details. A 
somewhat more exact term than 
“nun” might have been “temple 
prostitute” — but it would still have 
been wide of the mark. The con- 
cepts of the Way of Life were as 
subtle as any evolved by previous 
religions — and required a wide 
open mind. 

By then, however, the woman 
was making them welcome with 
smiles. She had for each of them a 



posy of fresh-picked flowers and in- 
vited them with gestures to leave 
the small room in which the skelter 
was located and follow her down a 
quiet corridor walled with stone 
and lit at intervals with lamps set 
behind translucent paintings, all of 
various living organisms, from 
naked athletes to lowly bacteria 
shown magnified thousands of 
times. 

“It is the belief of these people 
that no harm should ever be done 
to any evolved creature,” Hans 
whispered. “With one exception — 
if a superior creature may be saved 
from suffering thereby. They are 
willing to cure diseases even though 
it means killing germs — you follow 
me? — provided a human life can be 
made better because of it. You’ll 
find these people both kind and 
generous. This is a refuge they keep 
open for anybody who wants to 
come to it: people for whom life is 
too much of a problem, who need 
to rest and relax and think things 
out, or people who are ill and have 
no friends or relatives to look after 
them. You don’t have to believe 
what they believe. They give what 
they can and leave it at that.” 

“I — I see,” Anneliese answered. 
“Once 1 read a book about monks 
at the Pass of St. Bernard in Swit- 
zerland, who had to help everybody 
lost in the snow. Is it like that?” 

“Yes, much. Except you should 
say: people lost in the world.” 

He was infinitely relieved to find 
her so open-minded. Doubtless she

would also be favorably impressed 
when she learned that no meat was 
ever eaten here because no follower 
of the Way of Life could kill an ani- 
mal — he himself had never become 
a convert to total vegetarianism, 
but he had often had qualms of 
conscience about eating meat. 
When it came to some of the rituals 
glorifying sensuality, on the other 
hand, Anneliese might well be com- 
pletely repelled. But with luck she 
would have to stay here so short a 
time that she wouldn’t even hear 
rumors about that side of it. 

To an elderly, also nearly naked 
woman of perhaps sixty who had 
retained an astonishingly attractive 
figure even though her face was 
wrinkled like an old apple — but 
wrinkled for the right reason, be- 
cause she had talked and smiled 
and laughed a great deal all her 
life — he explained slowly in English 
the reason why he had brought 
Anneliese here. He referred to her 
parents’ fate and then to the attack 
at Aleuker’s and then to the burg- 
lar at his home where he’d taken 
her for safety and the elderly 
woman nodded every time she got 
the picture through the barrier of a 
half-comprehended language. 

“We shall help and take care,” 
she said firmly. “Is a badness, so 
much hate and hurt. Will here be 
safe!” 

He asked Anneliese, “Do you 
think you can stand it here for a 
while — for as long as it takes me to 
sort everything out?” 



She bit her lip. 

“1 think so,” she said. “I don’t 
understand why these people do 
what they do, but it must always be 
good to help people in trouble, I 
think. I don’t really understand 
why you’re helping me either, but I 
am very grateful to you.” 

That encouraged him to embrace 
her on parting and even to plant a 
chaste kiss on her lips: light, broth- 
erly, most out of keeping with the 
practices of the Way of Life. 

But luckily Anneliese didn’t 
notice the look of astonished dis- 
approval that crossed the face of 
the old nun. 

He was humming as he stepped 
back through the skelter in Swe- 
den, rehearsing the terms of the 
bargain he was going to strike with 
Mustapha: leave me alone and I 
won’t report you for selling illegal 
codes. Fair? 

It would have been. Would have 
had to be.

Take for granted in modern

That they should sleep 
In seven beds on seven

Incontinently in any given 
week . 

— Mustapha Sharif 

I n the other of the two rooms of 
his home where nobody except 
his closest and most intimate ser- 
vants entered — the first being the 
room with his secret skelter, the 
second not being his bedroom 
which had been shared over the 
years with an amazing range of 
partners — Mustapha Sharif waved 
aside with thanks that same boy 
who had tended Satamori’s wounds 
and pronounced himself capable of 
thinking clearly again. 

Ali and Feisal, his body-servants, 
and Muley, the chief scribe who 
was the third of his right hands, 
stood about Mustapha, exuding 
anxiety so fiercely he did not need 
eyes to read their expressions. 

“It must be done as it was done 
before,” Muley said in a senten- 
tious voice. 

“No.” Mustapha rubbed his 
forehead. His head still ached, but 
a cold compress, a salve and a glass 
of sweet mint tea with a pain-killing 
drug dissolved in it had brought his 
body’s agony under control. He 
said again, “No, not in any detail 
the way it was done before. Instead 
of dealing solely with a conscious 



criminal we now have to take steps 
to ensure the safety of an innocent 
girl, barely more than a child, for 
whom this — this person has con- 
ceived a fate worse than imprison- 
ment. He plans to put shackles on 
her mind, cripple her in a way no 
bodily restraint could match. He is, 
moreover, unaware of what evil he 
is hatching. Muley, I trust you as I 
trust myself — and sometimes more 
so. I need your thoughts to help 
me. Judge, in accordance with what 
you believe, a man married to a 
woman older than himself, not al- 
together intelligent. He has confin- 
ed her to him by legal bonds, then 
made her so miserable that she has 
learned to hate him and herself, 
too. On the basis of a chance en- 
counter with a younger woman he 
now decides he is going to abandon 
his wife — and he is showing himself 
capable of discarding her because 
he has a chance of deluding an ig- 
norant teenage girl into the mis- 
conception that she must depend 
on him and him alone in order to 
keep afloat in a world she doesn’t 
understand. Well?” 

M uley plucked at his large 
lower lip. He was a portly 
man, full-jowled, pot-bellied, soft. 
As a small boy he had trodden on 
an inefficient anti-personnel mine, 
which did not kill him but did re- 
duce him to a condition that in 
other ages had been more deliber- 
ately created. He also limped on his 
left leg.

“I had already passed my judg- 
ment,” he said, “before you set 
forth all your facts. Because there is 
one additional detail you seem not 
to have heard of.” 

“Tell me, then.” 

“This man is not married. He is 
widowed.” 

Mustapha tensed. “Explain! 
How do you know?” 

“The moment you returned, in- 
jured, I initiated an inquiry — dis- 
creetly and by roundabout routes, 
but also rapidly. The task was not 
difficult. News of an inquest is 
come by very simply.” 

“But you can’t be implying that 
he killed his wife?” 

“Indeed, no. The news runs that 
his wife killed herself as a result of 
some insult or affront he gave her.” 
“Ay-ay-ay!” Mustapha’s hands 
clenched into knobbly fists. “And 
there is to be an inquest?” 

‘‘Tomorrow morning at ten, 
local, in the Valletta coroner’s 
court.” 

“He is obliged to attend?” 

“Yes indeed. He is the only wit- 
ness to the facts.” 

‘‘Oh, but this is a disaster,” 
Mustapha cried. “For him not to 
appear will create a planetary hue 
and cry. But if he does appear he 
may let slip something that . 
Yes, it would be fatally easy for him 
to lose track of his complicated 
lies.” 

“We must eliminate him,” Ali 
murmured. ‘‘We can catch him 
when he arrives at the court — ” 



“Out of the question. He has sec- 
ret files to be opened in the event of 
his death. They record his expedi- 
tions with me — and while he 
pledged that he would not include 
any hint of my identity he may now 
have gone back on his word.” Mus- 
tapha shook his head. “No, I see 
only one possibility. We must track 
him down and persuade him it is 
still to his advantage to keep our 
secret. All being well, the threat of 
a bracelet will fetter his mind more 
securely than the ropes he used on 

I f » 



M ustapha rubbed his chafed 
wrists and ankles. ‘‘Some- 
times, you know, I feel that those 
with sight overestimate the advan- 
tages they derive from it. I would 
never have believed that anybody in 
his right mind could do as sloppy a 
job of lashing a man’s arms and 
legs as Hans Dykstra did with 
mine. In pain, giddy, frightened, I 
released myself from his amateur- 
ish bonds in — oh — perhaps two or 
three minutes. He left slack on both 
my wrists, as though he conceived 
them to be round instead of twice 
as thick one way as the other — 
Muley, detach a hundred appren- 
tices and juniors, preferably active 
and intelligent youths, and assign 
them to me for instructions. It 
should not be very hard to outguess 
someone like Hans Dykstra, who 
right now is gripped by a fear that 
should prevent his thinking clearly.

There are only a half-dozen places 
apart from the Valletta court where 
we stand a chance of catching him. 
We should be able to cover six 
skelters.” 

“We should ambush him at the 
house in Sweden,” Ali said. 

“If there is time — No, I can’t 
imagine that he won’t have by now 
discovered that I’ve made my es- 
cape. His reaction, if I read his per- 
sonality right, would have been to 
smash or burn the place. Not that 
I’m certain he’s done so. He’s disin- 
tegrating. He has lost both the 
things that justified his existence in 
his own eyes. He will no longer dare 
to indulge his illegal hobby, which 
he engaged in more from bravado 
than from love of knowledge — and 
equally he has lost that rare prize, a 
wife, just at the time he believed he 
was about to do what scarcely a 
man alive today has been able to 
do — get rid of her in favor of a 
woman younger and far more beau- 
tiful. He has been to a high place 
and seen the kingdoms — and it 
proved a lie. He must be losing his 
mind more from frustration than 
from any other single cause.” 

Mustapha folded his hands with 
an air of finality, but the servants 
made no move to depart. 

“Is something more remiss than 
you’ve told me?” 

“There is the matter of Dr. Sata- 
mori,” Ali said. “He is still here. 
Asleep, fortunately. But when he 
wakes he will no doubt wish to ex- 
press his thanks for your help.” 



“Then he must have the chance 
to do so. But make it clear when he 
does wake and asks to speak with 
me that I would far prefer to be at 
work on a new poem.” 

T he air in the Eriksson house felt 
as stiff as glass. Hans half-ex- 
pected to find it crashing down on 
him like a shattered dome as he 
forced himself to take a pace for- 
ward from the skelter. 

It was still very dark here, but 
the same log that had flared to re- 
veal Mustapha earlier was conserv- 
ing a bright glow and — perhaps 
fanned by the currents that had ac- 
companied Hans’s emergence — 
now transmitted flame to a sort of 
snakelike object lying in the hearth. 

Rope. The rope Mustapha had 
been bound with. 

Who — who — could have come 
and set the captive free? Had Mus- 
tapha guessed he would be attack- 
ed? Had he alerted one of his many 
servants? If / don’t return after 
such a time I can be found at such 
and such a code and I'll be in 
trouble . 

Hans put his hands giddily to his 
temples. Never in all his life had he 
foreseen he might wind up in a 
plight like this. It was infinitely 
worse than the nightmares he had 
sometimes experienced as a result 
of remembering how dangerous his 
illegal hobby was. But even if he 
were one day braced for his activi- 
ties he had always, deep down, 
imagined that there would be 



148 



GALAXY 




people who paradoxically would re- 
spect him as a martyr. The people 
he had met at Aleuker’s, above all, 
might exhibit that response. Surely 
someone like Boris Pech, who had 
asked to have a particular item 
searched out among the garbage of 
Europe — surely he and those he re- 
garded as friends would be tolerant 
of a selfless infringement of an ar- 
bitrarily absolute rule . 

But Hans wasn’t dealing with 
Pech, Satamori or Castelnuovo 
now. He was dealing with Mus- 
tapha Sharif, an unpredictable, 
emotional man who was as much of 
a stranger to Hans as during their 
earliest acquaintance. 

In sum — a man whose motives 
defied scrutiny as completely as if 
he were insane. 

A fter only a few seconds of 
^struggle Hans realized it was 
useless to try to reason his way out 
of yet another crisis before he slept. 
His day had stretched to more than 
double its normal length. He was 
shaking more from weariness than 
fear — after all, he had already pro- 
duced inspired solutions to several 
seemingly insoluble problems — and 
in a few hours he must really have 
all his wits about him. Checking his 
watch, he was appalled to see just 
how little time did remain before he 
was required to report for Dany’s 
inquest. 

Fatigue notwithstanding, he 
abruptly felt a need as deep as 
hunger to do something — at once. 



It was as though the sort of fury 
that wrenches the power to act from 
the head down to the guts had been 
grafted on his conscious mind — he 
felt a blending of naked anger with 
dazzling insight. 

“I will teach him a lesson,” he 
said to the air. “I will show him I’m 
not to be trifled with, even though I 
am a lowly recuperator and not a 
world-famous public figure — ” 

He strode forward across the 
floor, suddenly released from his 
moment of subjective paralysis. 

Beside the bed where Anneliese 
had slept stood the candle he had 
placed there. He lit it and carried it 
back into the living zone, trailing 
also the duvet, the big feather- 
stuffed coverlet that was — he 
fancied — faintly scented with her 
body. 

He went into the kitchen and 
opened the cock on the side of the 
oil tank serving the central heating 
system. He soaked the duvet, then 
dragged it across the floor after him 
so that there was a thick line of oil 
on the floor, thick enough to catch 
light and feed flame back to the 
puddle accumulating alongside the 
tank. Once the candle was touched 
to it, the whole lot would go up in a 
great smoky bonfire. 

At the last moment, instead of 
simply tossing the candle at the 
duvet and stepping into the skelter, 
he checked. He had never heard of 
a means to inactivate a skelter by 
remote control — but suppose Mus- 
tapha had arranged things so that 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



149 




he was meant to be trapped here? 
Suppose the elderly skelter had 
been sabotaged? He could burn to 
death in his own fire! 

He thought about that for a 
while, with a very clear and 
detached attitude, weighing the 
pros and cons. Eventually he 
balanced the candle on a candle- 
stick about eight or nine centi- 
meters high, leaned the duvet 
against it and used a folded shred 
of paper as a sort of fuse, certain to 
catch within five minutes but no 
sooner. 

Candle burns down while paper 
soaks up a little oil — paper burns 
and falls on duvet — duvet blazes up 
and the tank explodes . Right. 

He entered the skelter. It worked 
perfectly. He was at home. With a 
sigh of relief he rushed into the bed- 
room he once shared with Dany, set 
his alarm and collapsed into sleep 
without even taking time to un- 
dress.

T he building where the coroner’s 
inquest was to be held had 
been a hotel during the period 
when Malta was a popular tourist 
resort. It had been damaged in a 
riot and patched in an extraordi- 
nary fashion by an architect who 
was a devoted Maltese nationalist 
and felt it insulting to have 
“modern” buildings on this island. 
Even before its floors and windows 
had been mended, even before the 
damage due to firebombs and 
bullets had been repaired, he had 
insisted that its frontage be dis- 
guised with more “traditional” 
decoration. So, where there had 
been balconies of plain concrete 
and precast iron rails, there were 
now rain-worn plaster copies of the 
kind of molding seen on ancient 
churches, some threatening to 
break loose and needing to be 
lashed in place with bits of wire. 

But after the Blowup most 
people had kept their heads even 
less well than that architect. 

Hans’s mouth was dry and his 
eyes were blurred because, despite 
setting his alarm, he had overslept 
and left home in such a hurry he 
had forgotten to bring his dark 
glasses. It was a bright sunny day. 

However, what had haunted him 
during his short sleep and filled his 
dreams with images of distilled 
terror evidently had not come to 
pass. The media were not making a 
grand scandal out of the death of 
this married woman, even though 
the circumstances were scandalous. 



150 



GALAXY 




Newspapers were in evidence here 
because the TV was underfunded 
and unreliable — they were sold on 
the streets by people who could find 
no better employment, notably by 
bracees. On the placards held by 
those he passed as he walked to the 
court he read the day’s headlines 
and all were concerned with the 
tragedy at Aleuker’s party. Arrests 
had been made in the local Maori 
community. Some whites had been 
accused of complicity and enough 
important, famous people had been 
killed to make the event the chief 
topic of discussion the world 
around. 

Call it a fringe benefit. Time was 
when an event like Dany’s suicide, 
because of its local connections, 
would have displaced whatever 
happened half a world away, up to 
and possibly including an outbreak 
of war. Influenza-M, Alaskan 
croup and a particularly virulent 
strain of cholera had slashed the 
Maltese population by seventy per 
cent. It had become too small to 
run the islands properly and had 
had to be topped up by bribed 
immigration. Malta was now part 
of the world scene. 

So this morning Hans had only a 
minor ordeal to face. He would 
testify exactly as he had when con- 
fronted by Vanzetti and would 
benefit from the sympathy of the 
court because he had lost that pre- 
cious and all-too-often irreplace- 
able asset, his wife, and that would 
be that. By lunchtime or there- 



about he would be able to head for 
the Balinese refuge, collect Anne- 
liese (before she was overexposed to 
the ideals of the Way of Life, a 
sniggering demon remarked from 
the corner of his mind) and ask her 
where on the planet she would most 
like to live. Ah, a great idea. Invoke 
her opinion from the very start — 
that was the ticket. Make sure she 
was emotionally committed to 
everything from this day forward. 
In next to no time she would be 
taking it for granted that he and 
she did everything together, includ- 
ing choosing a home. So his right 
course would be to ask for com- 
passionate leave from his job — 
which, of course, would be granted 
without demur — and spend the 
next week or two becoming truly ac- 
quainted with Anneliese and ex- 
ploring some of the likeliest loca- 
tions for their new domicile. 

He had just realized he was 
humming cheerfully — and that was 
wholly wrong for a man whose wife 
had died under Dany’s circum- 
stances — when he rounded the last 
corner on the way to the building 
where the court was to meet for the 
inquest. 

And stopped dead. 

He had only once visited Mus- 
tapha’s palace at Luxor. But he re- 
membered with clarity the features 
of the chief scribe, Muley Hassan, 
who had shown him over the scrip- 
torium. 

Hassan was here. In ordinary 
European clothing instead of his 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



151 




regular Egyptian garb, with dark 
glasses on his nose — but unmistak- 
able. Hassan glanced at his watch 
as though confirming the time of 
arrival of a friend with whom he 
had a long-standing appointment. 

Hans stepped back as though he 
had been physically pushed. A per- 
son behind him complained in a 
volley of curses, mixed English- 
Arabic- Maltese, crowned with ob- 
scene German. 

But I mustn’t miss the inquest . 

What about a back entry to the 
building? Perhaps one where he 
could contact one of the helpful po- 
licemen he’d had such sympathy 
from? Hans thought hard about the 
layout of the district and concluded 
there was a back route that would 
delay him only a few minutes and — 
oh, miracle — Glimpsed through a 
door about to slam shut the ser- 
geant who had first appeared in his 
skelter. 

Hans rushed forward, shouting, 
and the man responded by holding 
the door ajar. 

“Mr. Dykstra — you ought to be 
in court by now.’’ 

“I know, I know — and I’m trying 
to get there.” Lies flowed from 
Hans’s tongue smoother than oil — 
the habit was becoming compul- 
sive. “But I’m trying to avoid some- 
body who knew Dany and thinks 
her death was my fault. I’m a little 
scared.” 

The sergeant looked grim. “Ah, 
I know just what you mean. We’ve 
had half a dozen cases like that. 



You’re talking about the sort of 
person who thinks every time a 
woman dies the race is in greater 
danger than it was yesterday.” 

It was the first time Hans had 
heard of people who held such 
views, but they jibed magnificently 
with his spur-of-the-moment inven- 
tion. He nodded. 

“Right. Come with me. I’ll have 
a word with Vanzetti. If we have to 
we can always clear the court.” 

“I hope that won’t be neces- 
sary,” Hans said and was startled 
to hear how sanctimonious his voice 
had become. “Although I guess it 
might be a good idea.” 

T he judge was convinced im- 
mediately that it was a good 
idea. He was a testy man, oozing 
perspiration. 

“I will not tolerate the slightest 
risk of a disturbance in my court,” 
he barked. “If the unfortunate Mr. 
Dykstra is likely to be hounded by 
lunatics — Is there any doubt that 
we have a simple suicide?” 

Vanzetti shook his head. “Ac- 
cording to our forensic people it all 
hangs together perfectly.” 

“In camera, then,” the judge 
said. “I know the press won’t like 
it, but they can go jump in the sea. 
I’m overworked and underpaid and 
I wish I, too, had time to pursue 
crackpot notions.”

room — which must originally have 
been a banquet hall — lasted less 
than thirty minutes and closed with 
the judge expressing his condol- 
ences. 

Leaving the room in company 
with Vanzetti, Hans said diffi- 
dently, “Inspector, you’ve been tre- 
mendously kind — but I wonder if I 
might impose on your good will just 
a little longer.’’ 

“Oh, by all means. I’ll do what I 
can for you. Do you want help in re- 
registering your domicile? I recall 
your saying you were afraid of be- 
coming a stuck if you had to keep 
coming back to the same place 
where your wife died.” 

“Uh — well, more or less,” Hans 
said with a swift change of mental 
gears. “I’m not yet sure of where I 
want to move to, but I do know I’d 
like to stay out of sight of certain — 
ah — fanatics.” 

“Do you know how you attracted 
their attention?” 

“Uh — no. Unless,” he added 
quickly as inspiration dawned, “it 
has something to do with my 
making it to Aleuker’s party. Per- 
haps somebody who was cheated of 
the chance — ” 

“And doesn’t realize how lucky 
he or she was,” Vanzetti grunted. 
“You heard the death toll is up to 
fourteen? Two more of the guests 
died and they have little hope of 
saving another two.” 

“Shameful.” 

“Yes, one would have expected 
mankind to learn a lesson from the 



Blowup, but — ” Vanzetti shrugged. 
“Well, it isn’t my job to redesign 
humanity. You want access to an 
official skelter, is that it? Under es- 
cort, so nobody can get at you?” 

“Yes, please. I’ll get my home — 
my old home — recoded so it can be 
offered for sale, but until then I 
think it might be sensible for me to 
intrude on the hospitality of various 
friends. Will you be needing me 
again?” 

“You heard the verdict. Suicide 
while of unsound mind. The case is 
closed.” Vanzetti hesitated. “I 
must admist, Mr. Dykstra — ” 

“You’re going to say,” Hans in- 
terrupted, “that I could have been 
a little kinder to my wife. Yes, I 
suppose so. But you know about 
her mental instability. I did my 
best. I promise you, my absolute 
best. It wasn’t enough.” 

“That’s a tough admission for 
any man to make,” Vanzetti said. 
“I think I rather admire you for 
being able to say it. So often one 
runs across people who are deter- 
mined to deny their own inade- 
quacy. No, change that to short- 
comings.” 

“Either way it hurts like hell,” 
Hans said. 

Vanzetti said With a nod, “I sup- 
pose I wound up in police work for 
the kind of reason exemplified by 
your predicament. We’re all dimin- 
ished by the stupidity and brutality 
of any given person, including our- 
selves. Very well, Mr. Dykstra, I’ll 
be glad to ensure you get safely into 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



153 




the skelter system and we’ll keep 
watch for anybody trying to pester 
you by using the code for your 
home until that’s revised.” 

“Oh, don’t go to that much 
trouble, please!” 

“No trouble, none at all.” With 
an airy wave. “Code-breakers are 
among the worst criminals of all, 
aren’t they? And the offense is com- 
pounded if what they’re trying to do 
is sneak past the privateer of some- 
one recently bereaved.” 

T hings were getting worse all the 
time, even when they appeared 
to be going best! Life was suddenly 
full of lunatic paradoxes and Hans 
felt himself being squeezed into 
new hateful and painful shapes as a 
result. 

His plea to Vanzetti had suc- 
ceeded at once — but now he was 
faced with an even worse problem. 
Believing that Hans was persecuted 
by madmen, Vanzetti was bringing 
to bear the force of the law on 
Hans’s predicament. 

And who had more to fear from 
the law than Hans himself, the man 
who had broken code after code for 
years, not by his own skills but by 
bribing somebody else? The kind of 
arrangement he’d made with Mus- 
tapha was bribery — it was conspir- 
acy, too, and there were other and 
even nastier names he shut away to 
the side of his mind. 

It seemed hideously certain that 
very soon he was going to be at 
some random location on the face 



of the planet, staring at a new neat 
shiny metal bracelet and thinking 
of how much of his life had been 
destroyed. 

Unless he contrived to salvage 
something from the wreckage. 

The image came readily to mind. 
Had he not spent most of his work- 
ing adulthood salvaging things that 
other people were then allowed to 
make use of? Was it not high time 
he took advantage of a salvage 
operation performed by someone 
else? Was that not the clear in- 
contestable definition of what he in 
fact was doing? 

All these thoughts rushed 
through his mind as he was 
whisked away from the court build- 
ing to the nearby police head- 
quarters and politely invited to step 
into a secure skelter there, one 
where no camera or detector could 
note and record the code punched 
by a person departing. It was for- 
bidden by law to record that. 

Poising his fingers, he spent a 
final second on confirming his 
opinion of what he was committed 
to. Yes, he was acting in ac- 
cordance with the ideals of a 
recuperator. His salvage happened 
to be a living human being — there 
was no other difference. 

He punched for the Way of Life 
refuge in Bali.

H e found Anneliese in a plain 
small room that might have 
been the twin of the one in which he 
himself had slept during his sole va- 
cation here, before he met Dany. 
One of its walls was covered with 
dark-green creeper growing up a 
wooden trellis from a shallow 
pottery tray containing soil. There 
was no other decoration. 

The girl was dozing on a heap of 
cushions, partly covered by a soft 
pink quilt, which on his entrance 
she gathered around her body in 
alarm — but not so quickly that he 
was unable to glimpse more of her 
skin than he had so far seen. 

He was briefly astonished to 
notice that it was pallid, white as 
dough. But of course that wasn’t to 
be wondered at in view of her up- 
bringing. She had probably never 
shown her body to the sun. How 
different from Dany, who had al- 
ways assumed that sitting on a 
beach in the altogether would in- 
stantly conjure up a horde of ad- 
miring men from the sand dunes. 
“Hans, is that you?” 



“Yes, of course.” He bent to kiss 
her cheek. Her first — and obvious 
impulse was to flinch away, but she 
restrained it and suffered his lips to 
brush her skin. “Are you all 
right?” 

“Uh — ” She sat up cautiously, 
making certain that the quilt was 
tightly wrapped about her. “Yes, 
they have been kind. They gave me 
food and drink and took my dress 
to be laundered.” She hesitated, 
searching his face with her dark 
eyes. “And you? Is everything all 
right?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“Oh, God! What’s gone wrong 
this time?” 

“I think I must have been right 
about the code-breaker having con- 
federates. The man escaped — and 
before leaving he set my home on 
fire.” 

“Oh, how horrible! How hor- 
rible!” 

“Yes, it is. But perhaps not so 
horrible as you think." 

“What do you mean?” 

He kicked around a cushion and 
sat down beside her, frowning. 

“It’s hard to explain. A sort of 
paradox. I feel — I feel as though 
I’ve been set free from something. 
Do you remember? When we 
arrived at my home I said I’d kept 
everything as it used to be for far 
too long?” 

“Yes, of course I remember.” 

“Now the whole of my past has 
been, so to speak, lifted from me. 
I’m not in the same situation you 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



155 




were in when you found that Feste- 
burg had been burned.” 

“You poor man — ” Impulsively 
she clasped his nearer hand, almost 
losing her grip on the quilt — but 
not quite. He curled his fingers 
around hers, thinking how large 
and clumsy they were compared to 
her small cool ones. 

“Is it-dreadfully hard to have to 
start one’s life again? Isn’t it a 
chance to forget your mistakes and 
this time get everything right?” 

“I — ” She bit her lip. “I suppose 
if you are a very strong person you 
can look at it that way.” 

“I don’t think I’m a particularly 
strong person. But that’s the way 
I’m trying to look at it. Would you 
like to — ” He hesitated. 

“What?” 

“Would you like to help me — as 
I’ve been helping you? Shall we go 
together in search of a new place to 
live, a new life for both of us?” 

A long moment passed before 
she answered. It was like a foretaste 
of eternity. 

But in the end she gave a nod 
and was able to force a smile. 

“Wonderful!” Hans leaned to- 
ward her and put his free arm 
around her shoulders. “Oh, I 
thought when I found myself face 
to face with that inferno I’d die of 
rage and misery. And suddenly 
you’ve made me happier than I 
imagined possible — ” 

“Was the house beyond saving 
when you arrived there?” she whis- 
pered. 



“Oh, yes. I almost walked into a 
wall of flames.” 

“You didn’t burn yourself?” She 
released his hand to feel his face. 
“If it was burning so fiercely — ” 

“No, I moved quickly,” he inter- 
rupted. “I don’t believe I even 
singed my hair. I stayed just long 
enough to take in the sight and 
then got away at once. 1 was afraid 
the skelter might break down with 
the heat and strand me. Maybe 
that was what the criminal in- 
tended.” He felt her shudder and 
added hastily: “Don’t distress your- 
self, darling. It’s over-over and 
done with. Let’s make our fresh 
start together right away and in a 
few days what has happened before 
to each of us will all be merely a 
bad dream. Any idea where you’d 
like to go? Somewhere sunny and 
safe — that’s what I’d like. The 
Caribbean, the Azores or Poly- 
nesia — ” 

“I — I don’t know,” she mut- 
tered. “Those are just noises to me, 
those names.” 

“Then we’ll begin by looking 
them over. It’s high time you be- 
came acquainted with the planet.” 
He rose to his feet. “I’ll go find 
your dress, or if it isn’t dry, some- 
thing else that you can wear. We’ll 
leave at once.” 



ii'\Tou are well rested?” Mus- 
j[ tapha inquired solicitously 
of Dr. Satamori. “You are fully re- 
covered?” 



156 



GALAXY 




“Well enough to get back to 
work, certainly,” Satamori said, 
gingerly touching the neat bandage 
around his head. “As for rested — I 
kept having nightmares.” 

“That’s hardly surprising,” Mus- 
tapha murmured. “I, too, had a 
bad dream, concerning what might 
have happened if I had gone with 
you to Chaim’s place.” 

They walked another few paces 
along the shady, colonnaded path- 
way leading to the skelter by which 
Mustapha’s guests arrived and left. 

Suddenly Satamori said, “My 
dream was that the attack came 
through the skelter instead of — no, 
I recall more clearly now. It came 
by land and sea. While the priva- 
teer was temporarily disconnected 
for the benefit of those who solved 
the treasure-hunt clues it would 
have been easy to send in two or 
three armed men.” 

“Or simply to deliver a powerful 
bomb,” Mustapha agreed gravely. 

“I’m glad I didn’t dream that, 
too,” Satamori said, with a nervous 
chuckle. They had almost reached 
the skelter. He paused and turned 
to face his host. “I am greatly 
obliged for all your help.” 

“There’s no need to leave even 
now if you’re not really up to it,” 
Mustapha said. “Stay longer, as 
long as you wish.” 

“No, really, I must go. I have 
work to do. And among the first of 
my tasks must be to check on 
what’s become of the people who 
won the treasure hunt. We are now 



even shorter of valuable brains than 
we were before. I hope I don’t 
sound callous, but one must make 
the best of things.” 

“You have a list of some kind?” 
Mustapha probed. 

“One was compiled by Chaim’s 
chief footman, but it was probably 
destroyed. No matter. I have a good 
memory and I was introduced to 
virtually all who arrived. I’ll start 
with the recuperator who showed 
such presence of mind in escaping 
with the Brazilian girl. Perhaps 
he’s a coward, but the important 
thing is that he could react quickly 
even when he was rather drunk. It 
shouldn’t be hard to locate him — 
he’s bound to show up some time at 
a public skelter, even if he doesn’t 
feel much inclined to come forward 
voluntarily for fear of becoming in- 
volved in another similar disaster. 
The elite among us are in constant 
peril.” He sighed heavily. “Musta- 
pha — 1 often find myself wishing 
that you’d accept a responsible 
post. You administer this place so 
skillfully, so tactfully — If anybody 
alive is developing the aesthetic of 
government that might replace our 
outworn ideologies it must be you.” 
“I have my roots too deep in the 
old world to achieve that goal,” 
Mustapha said. “I have not yet 
finished identifying and cleansing 
away the foul psychological poisons 
that are the inheritance of us all. 
Perhaps we shall never succeed — or 
perhaps your treasure hunt, which 
I’ve spoken of so scathingly, has al-

ready found you the person we 
need. Or perhaps the savior was 
among the dead. One cannot tell.” 
After a brief silence the two men 
embraced and Satamori entered 
the skelter. 



T he moment the scientist was 
gone, Mustapha clapped his 
hands loudly and Ali materialized. 

‘‘Has Dykstra not been found 
yet?” 

“Effendi, we are searching the 
whole planet. But when he appeal- 
ed to the police for the use of a 
secure skelter he slipped through 
our fingers.” 

‘‘He must be found. Dr. Sata- 
mori is about to turn loose the 
whole resources of the Skelter 
Authority to locate him. Before I 
decided to start selling codes to him 
I prepared the most exhaustive 
dossier 1 could about his life and 
habits. There is a recorded sum- 
mary of it, labeled HD, in my safe. 
Bring it to me at once. I must re- 
fresh my memory and see whether I 
have any other clues to his probable 
behavior.” 

When the cassette was delivered 
to him he dropped it into a player- 
recorder specially modified for 
ultra-fast playback — much practice 
had made Mustapha able to follow 
speech at up to ten times faster 
than normal speed. It was only a 
matter of minutes before he clapped 
his hands again, this time in high 
excitement, and issued fresh in- 



structions that impressed Ali 
mightily. 

‘‘The effendi indeed deserves the 
official rank Dr. Satamori offered,” 
he said. “One could almost believe 
him capable of reading men’s 
secret thoughts.” 

“Don’t waste time flattering 
me,” Mustapha snapped. “Go find 
out whether I’ve read his thoughts 
right.” 

anneliese’s dress was not yet 
nearly dry when — by a combi- 
nation of pidgin-English and ges- 
tures — Hans located it pegged out 
along with scores of other and 
much smaller garments on a pole 
overhanging a shallow stream that 
ran past the south side of the re- 
fuge. An appeal to a helpful young 
monk, who spoke a little more Eng- 
lish than most of the staff, obtained 
him a couple of alternatives — a sort 
of sarong left behind by a visitor 
from Sri Lanka and a suit of 
pajamalike jacket and trousers 
rather too large for Anneliese. He 
seized on the last eagerly, since it 
would cover her completely and he 
expected her gender to be his 
crucial problem. 

To his dismay Anneliese cast a 
single glance at his selection and 
shook her head, wrapping her quilt 
more tightly around her than ever. 

“That is for a man,” she said 
flatly. 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Perhaps you would not have 
thought of it. I know many women 



158 



GALAXY 




do go around in trousers. But I 
have always been taught that it is 
sinful for women to wear men’s 
clothes — or for men to wear 
women’s.” 

“My dear girl, surely — ” 

“Hans, I’m sorry, but I want my 
dress. It is decently long and it’s 
proper women’s clothing. Surely it 
won’t matter much if we have to 
wait a little longer for it to be com- 
pletely dry.” 

Defeated, Hans turned away. 
“I’ll see if I can find something 
else,” he muttered. 

“It’s not very likely.” 

“Why?” 

“I have been looking through the 
window.” She blushed a brilliant 
red as she spoke. “I’ve seen people 
walking about as shamelessly naked 
as animals. I shall never do that — 
never.” 

Her jaw set stubbornly. For a 
long moment he gazed at her in dis- 
belief. Then he went out. 

Another search of the refuge’s 
clothing store proved even more 
fruitless than the first. As the 
young monk explained apologetic- 
ally, lightweight clothing was ordi- 
narily converted into cleaning rags 
or bandages, while what winter 
wear was kept — shut at present in 
closets with branches of pennyroyal 
and other herbs to discourage 
moths — would run foul of Anne- 
liese’s prejudice against trousers. 
What more sensible garb, though, 
for one traveling to a colder 
climate? 



“Is the girl unwell in her mind?” 
the monk asked at length. 

“You might say so,” Hans 
snapped and explained about her 
upbringing. The young monk’s 
mouth rounded in amazement. 

“I have heard of that. Now I 
realize that her condition is even 
sadder than I was told. Well, we 
shall just have to find a quick 
means to dry her dress, if she will 
put on nothing else and won’t go 
about naked. Perhaps in the kit- 
chens. I shall take care of it.” 

Hans muttered a mechanical 
word of thanks and wandered fret- 
fully away, intending to rejoin 
Anneliese and see if he could cajole 
her into a more reasonable atti- 
tude. 

As he rounded the corner of the 
corridor leading to her room, how- 
ever, he heard his name called. 
Turning, he found the elderly nun 
whom he had met before hurrying 
toward him. 

“There is friend to see you,” she 
said, beaming. 

“What?” 

“At the skelter. All monks and 
nuns try finding you in all places 
since half-hour. Has message for 
you, he say, from mostly famous 
poet Mustapha Sharif. And is own 
name of Muley Hassan.” 

For an instant the world spun 
crazily around Hans. Then he 
heard his voice cry, “He’s lying! I 
don’t know anybody called that.” 

The nun stared at him, puzzled. 

“Is strange, then. He ask by

name for you, also for girl. Is — 
ah — An-nah-li-zah true? An-nah- 
li-zah Sen-keh?” She looked pleas- 
ed at having produced the Euro- 
pean name in recognizable form. 
“Send him away.” 

“But he ask by name and — ” 
“Send him away — or get me and 
Anneliese away. Anything as long 
as you don’t tell him where I am.” 
“But why, brother? Why this 
man so make you fear?” 

Hans drew a deep breath and ap- 
pealed to the one argument he was 
fairly sure might provoke results. 

“Do you wish a man to be 
murdered here at this refuge? If 
you don’t you’ll do as I say.” 
“Murder?” The nun’s eyes grew 
wide in horror. “He has come to 
kill you? Then you must be sent 
away.”

JoL“Here’s your dress. Put it 
on, since you won’t wear anything 



else, but hurry. Someone’s followed 
us here and we’ve got to get away.” 

He threw the damp garment at 
her. She caught it and clutched it to 
her bosom, staring wide-eyed not 
only at him but at the monk and 
nun who had also come to the door 
of the room, looking much dis- 
turbed at having had to lie. Muley 
Hassan had been sent to the 
farthest corner of the refuge on the 
pretext that Hans had last been 
reported there. A few precious 
minutes had been gained, but only 
Hans’s intense assurance that his 
life was at stake had won that re- 
prieve. It was a cardinal tenet of the 
Way of Life always to believe that 
everybody told the truth. Prince 
Knud had laid that down at the 
very beginning of his instructions 
because, he said, the doom of the 
old world was inherent in its habit 
of hypocrisy, ranging from bluff in 
international relations to hard-sell 
exaggeration in advertising. And 
because his teachings were so much 
akin to oriental tradition they had 
taken deep root among people like 
these. On the fringes of the greatest 
disaster in all of history these 
monks and nuns were still hunting 
for clues to help them understand 
why the population crash called the 
Blowup had occurred. 

Hence the existence of Way of 
Life refuges like this one all over 
Asia and Africa and the Pacific — 
and their absence in Europe and 
North America, places where not 
only was there no need to explain 



160 



GALAXY 




the causes of the Blowup, but so 
much damage had been done to the 
minds of the survivors that the no- 
tion of having strangers wander at 
will among them was untenable. 

“Do as I say!” Hans roared at 
Anneliese and she flinched. 

“I am to get dressed with so 
many people staring?” 

No, no, it simply couldn’t be pos- 
sible. It couldn’t be that he, Hans 
Dykstra, was condemned because a 
stupid girl was ashamed to show 
her nipples. But he gathered his 
wits by main force and without a 
word rushed the others from the 
room. Over his shoulder he cried, 
“Hurry! Hurry!” 

B ut she didn’t. Time leaked 
away, while he and the monk 
and the nun stood irresolute in the 
corridor. Then another monk came 
in sight and called out something — 
Hans was able to detect the name of 
Muley Hassan and his patience 
shattered. He flung wide again the 
door of Anneliese’s room and found 
her red-faced and struggling to 
fasten her long drab dress. 

“What are you playing at?” he 
demanded. 

She exclaimed in horror at 
having him intrude when she was 
incompletely covered. Over her 
bosom, the front-closing zip was 
jammed at a height most girls 
would regard as excessively modest, 
but she by contrast covered with 
both hands. 



“It’s shrunk and I can’t do it 
up.” 

The world turned red, like the 
fire he had set at the Eriksson 
house and had never seen but could 
imagine. He seized her by the arm 
and literally dragged her from the 
room in disregard of her shrieks of 
protest. The nun and the two 
monks tried to interfere, but he 
brushed them aside and physically 
carried Anneliese the last few 
meters to the skelter. He shoved her 
into it and punched the first remote 

code that came to his mind 

Panama. 

To the girl, very close to her ear, 
he said between his teeth, “You 
would rather be beaten up, maybe 
killed, maybe raped, than let me 
see a patch of your chest? Are you 
insane?” 

She fought him for another few 
seconds, then wilted against his 
shoulder, weeping, as he pushed 
her out of the skelter. Here, as 
almost everywhere, the concourse 
around the skelter outlets was full 
of stucks and bracees, making shift 
to earn their living as touts and 
shills and guides. 

“I don’t understand yourworld,” 
Anneliese was moaning. “I hate 
it — and it makes me terrified ” 

Alertly dozens of the watchers 
reacted and closed in. 

“Ah, sir!” the first said, choos- 
ing English — he seemed no more 
than fifteen, but was muscular and 
agile. “You want private place to 
finish raping virgin girl, yes ? I got

good place cheap. I — ” 

Hans cuffed him aside with the 
flat of his hand, looked desperately 
for a way past the others and failed 
to find one. The universe seemed to 
be full of greedy outstretched 
hands, shouting mouths, the glint 
of light on bracelets that forbade 
entrance to the skelter system . 
“Hey, you!” 

A bo.oming voice that overrode 
the clamor from the touts and shills 
and rang with authority caused the 
mob to fall back and give passage to 
the speaker: a heavy-set man in his 
early forties, well-dressed, clean- 
shaven. He carried in his left hand 
what might have been a photograph 
because he glanced at it before con- 
tinuing to Hans. 

“Aren’t you Hans Dykstra? I 
have a message for you from — ” 
But already Hans’s fevered mind 
had completed the sentence, by way 
of an instantaneous detour that 
posed the question: How did Mus- 
tapha manage to ensure that one of 
his agents was here in Panama — a 
place / chose at random? 

“Quick!” he forced out and, 
taking Anneliese by the arm again, 
dragged her back into the skelter 
and punched for .

work? Oh, if there were a God I'd 



pray. I d pray, but there's only the 
impersonal force that evolved us 
from the slime . 

“Hans, Hans, let me go — ” 
Anneliese was shrieking, trying to 
pummel him with her free hand. 

The cry attracted attention. Here 
in an Arctic winter the concourse 
was nearly deserted — those whom 
chance had stranded this far north 
spent the time of sunlessness, or so 
he had been told, adapting the 
ancient Eskimo practice of wife- 
swapping to the tenets of the Way 
of Life. But a fat ugly woman wear- 
ing some sort of police-like uniform 
jumped up from a bench and came 
toward Hans, grinning from ear to 
ear. 

“Hey, you’re Dykstra, aren’t 
you? I never expected you to — ” 

And back into the skelter and 
away. Code: Victoria, Vancouver 
Island — on the western fringe of 
Canada that had escaped the worst 
of the fallout from the Blowup. 

It was as though Mustapha had 
multiplied himself, become a sort 
of all-knowing deity, able to see the 
entire planet at a single glance. 

and again at Victoria — how could 
J\. that devil have planted his 
agents at every public skelter 
outlet? There were thousands and 
even if Mustapha had sent every 
last member of his retinue to keep 
watch — surely he couldn’t have 
enough people to cover every eyelet 
of the web. 

But once more a stranger rose

and approached with a smile and 
uttered Hans’s name and he fled as 
before. Where to this time? Some- 
where isolated in the middle of an 
ocean — Tahiti, the Seychelles . 

He settled for the latter and 
emerged with the girl at another 
Victoria, on the island of Mahe, 
and here nobody was waiting for 
him. Almost unable to believe he 
was truly free, Hans emerged cau- 
tiously on to a nearly deserted con- 
course, seeing broken windows 
around him, much litter blowing in 
a breeze, a dark man asleep beside 
a refreshment stand. Nobody else. 

He heaved a vast sigh and let go 
of Anneliese’s arm. 

“I’m sorry. I’m most terribly 
sorry, I really am. But you saw 
what happened everywhere else 
we’ve been until now, didn’t you?” 

Rubbing the spot where his 
fingers had clamped, viselike, she 
said sullenly, ‘‘All I saw was that a 
lot of people recognized you and 
said they wanted to give you a 
message. I don’t know why you 
have to run away from them. I wish 
I’d never said I’d come with you. 
You seem to be treating me more 
like — like baggage than a person!” 

“But the only people I can think 
of who might want to hound me are 
criminals like the one who burgled 
my home and then burned it 
down — ” Hans felt perspiration 
spring from every inch of his skin. 

“You have criminal gangs who 
can be ready and waiting any place 
you go, ambushing innocent people 



even though they can go right 
around the world in next to no 
time? Then modern life is even 
more abominable than I already 
thought it was.” 

She gave him a defiant glare, her 
chin jutted at a sullen angle. His 
heart sank. Searching for some 
fragment of consolation, he could 
find nothing better than the fact 
that for the moment at least she 
had forgotten about her stuck 
zipper. 

He soothed her by degrees until 
she relaxed enough to agree to ac- 
company him front the concourse 
.and find a place to lodge. The 
sound of their altercation had 
woken the man at the refreshment 
stand. He stood up, rubbing sleep 
from his eyes, and offered his 
wares — stale-looking pastries and 
flyblown fruit, old bottles refilled 
with sickly soft drinks colored re- 
pulsively bright red, green and 
purple. 

Hans refused, but inquired with- 
out much hope whether there was a 
hotel to be found. 

The man shook his head. “No, 
sir. Is not hotels here any more. But 
is a lodging house I know — good, 
cheap, clean. Is my sister-in-law 
who runs it. I write address and 
give directions, too.” 

He seized a stub of pencil, tore 
the corner off a yellow sheet of 
newspaper and in slow, awkward 
capitals wrote two hard-to-decipher 
lines. After going through the data 
with him, Hans thanked him and

was about to take Anneliese’s arm 
again when he realized the man was 
holding out his palm with a look of 
annoyance. 

Oh. Of course, a tip. He felt in 
his pocket and produced a couple 
of coins, suddenly remembering 
with a wrenching sensation that he 
had almost no money on him. He 
had forgotten to pick up his spare 
cash when he last had stopped at 
home. 

S o he would have to go back yet 
one more time — and if there 
were one place where Mustapha 
would beyond doubt have planted 
his agents, it would be at Valletta. 
It wouldn’t be possible for the Arab 
to get past the privateer in Hans’s 
own skelter, but of course the house 
still had ordinary doors and win- 
dows . No, wait a second. 
Hadn’t Vanzetti promised that the 
police would keep a watch on his 
home? So it would probably be safe 
to go there after all. And if it 
proved to be otherwise there were 
alternatives — he could, for ex- 
ample, go to the Recuperation Ser- 
vice headquarters and draw some 
money there, payment in advance 
for the compassionate leave he had 
applied for. He breathed a little 
more easily as he led Anneliese out 
of the concourse building, along a 
littered street past shabby buildings 
to the shabbiest of them all, ob- 
viously the “good, cheap, clean” 
lodging. 

The woman who came to answer 



Hans’s knock at the rickety front 
door smiled and bobbed and 
escorted him and Anneliese in- 
doors, explaining that yes, luckily 
there was room for someone else be- 
cause one of the long-term lodgers 
had just died and nobody had yet 
rented the vacancy. She showed 
them into an ill-furnished, cramped 
room with a double bed, a wash- 
stand so ancient that had he come 
on it in the course of his work Hans 
would have thought it worth recup- 
erating and selling as an antique. A 
big wardrobe stood lopsided against 
the wall because one of its legs was 
missing. 

Anneliese stared about her in dis- 
may. Thinking it was because of 
the state of the room, Hans began 
apologetically to explain about the 
collapse of the hotel business the 
world over, so that in most places 
one could find nothing better than 
this sort of squalid accommoda- 
tion — but that wasn’t what was on 
her mind. 

“There must be two rooms,” she 
ordered. “Find a place where there 
are two rooms. I will not accept 
this — we are not married!” 

And before he could conjure up 
an answer she was storming at him, 
unleashing a flood of words that 
battered his ears until his skull 
seemed to be ringing like a bell. 

“Every man I have met since 1 
came from Brazil is the same. You, 
too, whom I thought honest and 
moral. I was a fool to believe your

all his castles in the air were col- 
lapsing around Hans. He could 
barely believe that so short a time 
had transformed Anneliese from 
the shy, seemingly affectionate 
child who had been so delighted to 
find someone at Aleuker’s to whom 
she could talk — albeit slowly and 



with many verbal footnotes — in her 
own language. Now she seemed to 
have turned into a thoroughgoing 
virago, tongue-lashing him with 
more imagination and more sheer 
anger than Dany had ever achieved. 

Could this be the fruit of the 
ideals to which she had been 
raised? It seemed incredible. How 
could people get along with one an- 
other if they thought this attitude 
the right and proper one? 

And then he remembered sickly 
that they hadn’t gotten along with 
one another. They had been so 
crazy that they had invented wea- 
pons capable of wiping out whole 
cities at a blow — and they had used 
the skelter first of all to commit 
theft, murder and sabotage. 

Dazed, he could do nothing ex- 
cept comply with Anneliese’s de- 
mands. Walking back to the skelter 
concourse, to the accompaniment 
of her sniffs and snorts of contempt 
at the state of this rundown dirty 
little town, he searched his mind 
for some other place to which he 
might risk taking her. 

Tahiti had crossed his mind a 
little while ago, he recalled. Would 
that be tolerable by her standards? 
Most likely not, because it was a 
clean smart place patronized by 
skelter tourists, people taking long 
vacations with plenty of money in 
their pockets. If Anneliese had 
been horrified to see people at the 
Balinese refuge going about, clad 
only in kilts and baldrics, carrying 
out their daily tasks, how much

more offended would she be at the 
sight of women and gay men 
sprawling naked on the beach in 
the hope that they would attract 
partners for the night? 

He didn’t know. He literally had 
no idea. He couldn’t get hold of the 
lunatic standards she lived by. 

Was there a skelter-using com- 
munity conservative enough to sat- 
isfy her anywhere on the planet? 
Well, if there were it would have to 
be in Australia. The problem was 
not that no one at all nowadays 
adhered to Anneliese’s sort of prin- 
ciples. It was that the communities 
where her beliefs were in force were 
disdainful of the skelter or terrified 
of it. He had never been to any of 
them apart from making a brief 
tour of the town near Mustapha’s 
home — during which so many 
people had made signs at him to 
ward off the Evil Eye — or had spat 
at the prints he left in the 
dust — that he’d lost count in a few 
minutes. 

Did he know the code for any 
place in Australia? The answer was 
no. He would have to consult a di- 
rectory and pick a spot at random. 

T here were a few more people in 
the concourse now, half a 
dozen altogether, including a 
couple of curious children buying 
soft drinks at the refreshment 
stand. He waited until they had 
been served, then asked about a di- 
rectory. At sight of him the sales- 
man’s face fell. 



“You did not like the home of my 
sister-in-law?’’ 

“She — she had only one room 
and we wanted two.” 

A pause, during which the sales- 
man looked him over with mingled 
amazement and contempt: if a man 
can persuade a girl so pretty to 
travel with him, how can he not 
share her bed? A good question . 
But he moved at last, pointing 
toward a booth Hans had not 
noticed on the far side of the con- 
course. The salesman said there 
was a directory in the booth. 

Hans expected Anneliese to come 
with him — she declined and sat 
down firmly on a vacant bench. 

“You make me walk too much — 
my feet hurt. And this is the world 
where they told me you never need 
to walk because you have the skel- 
ter.” 

So Hans went to the directory 
booth alone and leafed through a 
tattered, out-of-date volume with 
many pages missing. The purpose 
they had been put to was plain from 
the stench that arose from a corner 
of the booth. The floor had sub- 
sided — there was a hole in it and 
people had used it as an impromptu 
latrine. 

Half-deafened by the buzz of 
flies that circled the spot, Hans 
eventually located and memorized 
the code for the public skelter out- 
let in Alice Springs, Australia, 
which — so he seemed to remem- 
ber — was currently flourishing and 
certainly must be as conservative as

most of the subcontinent. He 
headed, sighing, back toward the 
bench where he had left Anne- 
liese — and realized with a shock of 
horror that she wasn’t there. 

Staring frantically around, he 
spotted her approaching the skel- 
ters, talking animatedly to a man in 
neatly tailored clothes who certainly 
had not been on the concourse a 
few minutes ago. 

He shouted at her. Glancing 
fearfully at him, she clutched her 
new companion’s arm and whisper- 
ed something that impelled him to 
hurry her into the nearest booth. 
Before Hans could catch up, a wash 
of bright blue light signaled their 
departure. 

To anywhere. 

F or a long while Hans simply 
stood there cursing, his hands 
clenched so tightly he fancied blood 
would run from the tips of his nails. 
The children regarded him in 
amazement, sucking their soft 
drinks noisily through straws. 
Several other people also gazed at 
him. 

At long last he managed to 
gather his wits and say to the air, 
“He’s not going to get away with it. 
I’ll see him in hell first!” 

He strode to the skelter by which 
Anneliese and the unknown man 
had traveled and punched a code 
he had only used once before but 
remembered almost better than his 
own. 



It belonged to Mustapha Sharif.

XlAli and stood aside from 
the doorway of the Room of 
Leopards, so that Hans could pass 
him, shouting wildly. 

“What have you done with her, 
damn you?” 

Mustapha, seated cross-legged 
on a pile of soft cushions, raised the 
brow over one sightless eye. 

“Hans, good day to you,” he 
murmured. “I have been half-ex- 
pecting you. Be seated and let Ali 
serve you some refreshment.” 

“I want to know what you’ve 
done with Anneliese!” 

“You have become separated 
from her?” 

“Lost h*er, as you damned well 
know.” 

“To be strictly accurate, I didn’t 
know. But I’m glad. That is as it 
ought to be.” 

“You — ’’ Hans’s voice failed 
him — he recovered it with a tre- 
mendous effort. “You have the gall 
to sit there and say she didn’t go off 
with one of your agents?” 

“My dear fellow, am I a miracle- 
worker?” 

Bewildered, Hans wondered if he 
were losing his sanity. Had he not 
himself found it hard to believe that 
Mustapha could have his servants 
ready and waiting at every public 
skelter on Earth? And yet . 

“You’re not denying you sent 
your chief scribe Muley in search of

scuffle of his shoes at the end of the 
corridor. He almost caught up with 
you twice, I believe, and I’m 
puzzled, not to say offended, that 
you decided to avoid him. You 
made things even worse, I gather, 
by lying in order to persuade the 
monks and nuns at the Balinese 
Way of Life refuge to lie, too. Ever 
since our first meeting you’ve 
claimed to follow that Way. It is 
sad to realize that a friend of long 
standing has been telling you un- 
truths, isn’t it?” 

Giddy, Hans had to sit down — 
the alert Ali made sure that a stool 
was ready behind his legs. 

“But if Anneliese didn’t go off 
with someone you sent after us — ” 

Muley entered silently. Musta- 
pha acknowledged his bow with a 
brief nod. 

“Explain the circumstances,” he 
invited Hans. And, having heard 
Hans’s broken summary, had to 
chuckle. 

“Hans, Hans, I suppose I should 
feel flattered because you thought 
all that was my doing!” 

“Whose, then?” Hans demanded 
furiously. 

“Who but a senior official of the 
Skelter Authority could ensure that 
watch was being kept, world-wide, 
for a single man? Frederick Sata- 
mori was here — recovering from 
the injuries he suffered at Chaim 
Aleuker’s — at the very moment you 
and I were talking at the house in 



Sweden, the conversation you ended 
in such an unceremonious fashion.” 
Mustapha had discarded his ban- 
dage, but now he raised one hand 
to part his hair and display a piece 
of bright pink sticking-plaster cov- 
ering his scalp wound from the 
poker. 

“But Anneliese wouldn’t have 
gone off with a total stranger, even 
if he were an employee of the 
Skelter Authority — ” 

“What grounds do you have for 
saying that she would not?” Musta- 
pha retorted. “During the few brief 
hours of your acquaintance at 
Aleuker’s party, had you become 
such old and intimate friends? No, 
on the contrary — I say you have one 
hundred per cent evidence that 
that’s exactly what she would do. 
Haven’t you realized yet that she is 
deranged?” 

“I — ” Hans’s jaw dropped. 

“I can see you had begun to sus- 
pect as much and were denying the 
truth to yourself.” 

With renewed fury: “So you told 
Satamori to find me and Anne- 
liese? Is he pimping for you now? 
You want her for yourself, is that 
it? Well, I can tell you — ” 

“Never in my entire life, and I’m 
no longer a young man,” Mustapha 
said thinly, “have I been so mor- 
tally insulted. And I am not the 
only one to take offense. Look at 
my servants. Can you not read in 
their faces that they would cheer- 
fully seize you and drag you 
screaming up my tallest minaret

and pitch you to your death on the 
flagstones below? It is as gentle a 
fate as you deserve. But you are 
yourself insane now. Possibly you 
always have been. In that case I am 
to blame for having befriended you. 
So I will answer with fair words. 
No, I did not set Satamori on your 
trail. Because of the loss of Chaim 
and other crucial members of our 
ruling elite he was eager to track 
down those who solved the clues to 
Chaim’s treasure hunt. You were 
the first person to do so and he 
wanted to get in touch with you and 
offer you a better job, a more re- 
sponsible and higher salaried one. 
Instead you let yourself become ob- 
sessed with a mentally disturbed 
girl, barely more than a child. You 
let your wife sacrifice herself and 
gave perjured evidence about her 
death. You — ” 

“Lies, lies!” Hans shrieked. 

“Ali, serve our visitor a tranquil- 
izing draught. It will soften his 
panic and enable him to think and 
talk more like his normal self.” 

Ali proffered an engraved brass 
cup. Hans swept it aside, crying, 
“Out to poison me now, are you?” 

“Ali, fill two cups. The strain is 
telling on me and I, too, would wel- 
come some of that drink. If you 
choose which cup I should take, 
will that content you?” Mustapha 
added to Hans. 

Hans licked lips gone suddenly 
dry. Eventually he nodded. 

“Good. I might add that it’s just 
as well that you made the choice 



you did — because if I had to kill 
you, I would. I had your prede- 
cessor killed when he started pilfer- 
ing things from the houses we 
visited together. I do not wish to 
wear a bracelet. But I do wish to 
make several things clear to you. 
When your mind is settled enough 
to take them in I shall continue 
with my explanations. I would 
rather convince you than have your 
death on my conscience.”

^ — Mustapha Sharif 

P erhaps Mustapha was more ac- 
customed to whatever was in the 
tranquilizing draught — at any rate, 
he seemed unaffected by it when he 
had drained his cupful. By contrast 
Hans was pervaded by a sudden 
and alarming detachment. He felt 
as though his ego had separated 
from his body and now floated 
above his head, observing himself, 
controlling his movement and

speech but from a distance like 
some puppet master. 

He said, enunciating carefully, 
“Well — explanations! And I warn 
you — make them good.” 

A yawn unexpectedly stretched 
his last word. He converted it into a 
gasp. 

Mustapha said, “You must have 
wondered what it is I gain from 
visiting abandoned homes with 
you.” 

“Yes, often.” 

“I obtain insight into the process 
that led to my being blinded.” 

“How — No, I shouldn’t ask. The 
question is too personal.” 

“On the contrary, you should 
have asked long ago and you would 
have made more sense of your life. I 
was blinded because I was looking 
directly toward a nuclear fireball. It 
was the bomb that destroyed the 
Suez Canal. Who fired it doesn’t 
matter. But its glare passed, as if 
focused, straight through my cor- 
neas, which are as you have seen 
unmarred. But on each of my 
retinas the point at which the optic 
nerve sets in was cicatriced, con- 
verted in a fraction of a second to 
useless scar tissue. It is because of 
that experience that when I go to an 
abandoned home belonging to 
people who lived by the old 
standards, I find something dif- 
ferent there from what you find. I 
find a distillation of what used to 
disguise the cruelty and brutality 
humans were capable of. You go to 
such places in a spirit of envy and 



resentment. You wish you could 
have lived as they did, not realizing 
that it would mean paying the 
spiritual price they paid. At heart 
you belong to that old and cruel 
world.” 

“No—” 

“Do you not? Do you really not? 
Because I do.” 

Confused, Hans shook his head. 
The sensation was like twitching 
marionette strings. 

Mustapha continued: “I belong 
so completely to that old world, de- 
spite all my efforts to identify the 
foul poisons it has left in the col- 
lective psyche of mankind, that 
when I heard Satamori was going to 
search for you I gave way to panic. I 
could foresee your betraying me. It 
was not until I sent for and heard 
again a tape I once compiled about 
you, the one that documented your 
past history and impelled me to 
decide that you and I would 
become partners in crime, that I 
realized how stupid I was being. At 
first I was thinking of catching you 
and tying you up, as you tied me — 
only better. You made a terribly 
clumsy job of those bonds, you 
know. Then I realized that was be- 
traying my own vision of man’s 
ultimate nature — and in the up- 
shot, I’m delighted to say, my 
better judgment has been proven 
right. You did come here of your 
own free will and you have become 
separated from Anneliese to whom, 
as I told you, only harm could come 
from your relationship — -”

GALAXY 




“Stop, stop! That isn’t true — ” 
“Ah, but it is. Think hard, 
Hans.” Mustapha leaned forward, 
his sightless eyes seeming to bore 
into Hans’s very brain. “Think first 
about your own situation. Do you 
feel the world has treated you un- 
justly?” 

“Yes, damn it, .yes!” Hans felt 
tears start to his eyes. “I haven’t 
done any real harm to anybody. I 
was simply taken aback and mis- 
calculated about a couple of things. 
It isn’t fair that I should have been 
punished for — ” 



4411/ ho punished you?” Mus- 
VY tapha slipped in the ques- 
tion with the neatness of a physi- 
cian using a hypodermic needle. 
“You are guilty of a major crime, 
as the standards of today measure 
crime. You’re a code-breaker. So 
am I.” 

“But I became one only because 
I wanted to come to grips with the 
past, document it, leave my reports 
for the archeologists of the 
future — ” 

“Not true. If that had been the 
truth, could you not have gone to 
your superiors and said that in ad- 
dition to working as a recuperator, 
a legal scavenger, you wanted — in 
your own time — to garner informa- 
tion, too? They would never have 
accorded me that privilege. But to 
you, a trustworthy and indeed a re- 
spected colleague, they would have 



said yes. You could have had dis- 
continued codes with full legal 
authority. But you didn’t want 
that. You wanted to be regarded, 
albeit after your death, as a man 
who dared to defy society’s rules.” 

“That’s not so! They would never 
have let me — ” 

“Damnation, man! You met the 
people, or some of them, who are 
running Earth these days. You met 
Satamori and Aleuker and Pech 
and the others at that ridiculous 
party. For all I maintain that 
they’re going about saving man- 
kind the wrong way, inventing new 
rules and regulations when what we 
most desperately need is to apply 
common sense instead of inflexible 
principles that become out of date 
in a year or two — for all the dis- 
agreements I’ve had with them, I 
have to concede them this much: 
they’re the most open-minded 
people ever to achieve such power 
in the whole of human history. You 
don’t know what Satamori said 
when he mentioned that he was go- 
ing to track you down, so I’ll tell 
you. He said, approximately, that it 
wouldn’t matter if you proved to be 
a coward, as was suggested by the 
speed of your flight from Chaim’s 
home. What counted was that you 
were plainly a quick thinker.” 

A faint moan escaped from 
Hans’s lips. He tried to stop it and 
could not. 

His voice colored by pity, Mus- 
tapha went on more softly, “There’s 



WEB OF EVERYWHERE 



171 




one thing you still have to accept, 
my friend. You are acting as 
though you became the — the pro- 
prietor of this girl Anneliese. You 
could never have done so. You 
could at best have been her — 
keeper.” 

“But she didn’t seem to be men- 
tally disturbed — ” 

“No more do you, from most 
people’s standpoint. Less than — ” 
Sensing that Hans was drawing 
breath to interrupt, Mustapha 
raised one hand to forestall him. 
“Less than I do, was what I was 
about to say. I know for a fact that 
Chaim Aleuker believed me to be a 
dangerous man. He suspected me 
of vaulting ambition, of a lust for 
power, of degrees of hypocrisy un- 
paralleled in the worst of the olden 
days — and with all respect to his 
memory I must argue that he was 
wrong. 

“Honestly, my friend, how could 
you imagine that someone in Anne- 
liese’s plight could be less than 
seriously deranged? Your wife 
Dany, unlikable perhaps, was still 
capable of functioning as a person, 
more or less, capable of making her 
own friends and even of being 
singled out as a recipient of one of 
those silly treasure hunt invitations. 
Surely with her before you as an 
example of how deeply deformed a 
personality can become — thanks to 
the trauma mankind has under- 
bone — you ought to have seen how 
much more seriously Anneliese 
must have been affected? A priori! 



And you ought also — ” Mustapha’s 
voice dropped — “to have applied 
the same lesson to yourself.” 

Hans gulped air, but could not 
answer. 

44 A s FAR as * m concerne d,” 

/iLMustapha went on, “I am 
ashamed of what the old world did 
to me and I want the world to know 
my feeling. I’m ashamed that there 
was so much greed and envy and 
that greed and envy are in my 
nature, too. I’m ashamed that 
people had power without respon- 
sibility and since I have power I 
strive to act in a responsible 
manner, not by accepting govern- 
ment posts but by listening when 
those in need come to me, by help- 
ing those who cannot help them- 
selves, by admiring the petty 
achievements of those who have no 
better and yet do not deserve to 
have nothing at all. Possibly I am 
respected — I believe I am. But that 
is by strangers, people far away 
whose only contact with me is 
through what I have written. What 
counts above all for me is that I 
know I am liked by the people who 
live in the town just beyond the far 
wall of my home.” He thrust out a 
chubby arm and slapped what 
happened to be the head of one of 
the painted leopards, bowed to the 
gutting of a deer. 

“It is because those who had far 
more than I dare ever dream of 
having,” he concluded, “chose to 
use their wealth in such abomin- 



172

able ways, that I would rather be 
regarded as eccentric than join the 
ruling elite. But that is my personal 
opinion. I have no right to instruct 
you to follow my example. What I, 
or any other man, may justly do is 
say this to you: you have misjudged 
yourself, taken the wrong measure 
of yourself. As a result you have a 
death on your conscience — and 
your wife’s at that. You have a 
talent and from that flows your 
chance to atone. You dreamed of 
making the girl subservient to you 
by trapping her in a web of cajole- 
ment — but I went over that and you 
answered me with a blow on the 
head. Instead, go to Satamori, ac- 
cept whatever post he feels you are 
capable of taking on, dedicate 
yourself to it. Convert, transform, 
sublimate your desire for power 
into a liking for work well done. It 
is possible. I think that what 
persuaded me to select you as — I 
use the phrase again — my partner 
in crime must have been that I 
sensed your ability to achieve that 
kind of sublimation. Now prove me 
right.” 

Out of all that long discourse 
Hans clutched at and retained one 
key suggestion. Rising, his mind 
foggy, he said, “You want me to go 
straight to Satamori?” 

“I think it is a wise course of 
action.” 

“Very well. Ali, lead me to the 
nearest skelter and find the code 
for the headquarters of the Skelter 
Authority.”

I ess than five minutes later he 
j was there. And a young man 
appeared to him from another skel- 
ter after a safe interval and faced 
him through armor glass from 
behind a reception desk which — 
Hans didn’t have to be told — con- 
cealed guns. The pattern was the 
same at that point in Recuperation 
HQ which had to be open to the 
public. When the arrival signal 
sounded, what had entered the 
room might not be a person, but a 
saboteur’s bomb. 

He identified himself and added: 
“I gather Dr. Satamori has been 
looking for me.” 

The young man’s face bright- 
ened. 

“I’ll say he has. I never before 
had to issue so many copies of a 
single person’s picture. We’ve been 
standing by at every public skelter 
outlet to try and locate you, but I 
guess you haven’t felt much inclined 
to travel. I heard the sad news 
about your wife— if you don’t mind 
my mentioning that? Some people 
do mind, some don’t. The reaction 
seems to be culturally dependent. 
Well, what can we do for you?” 
“Show me to Dr. Satamori, I 
guess,” Hans muttered. 

“Well, right this minute he’s not 
here,” the young man said. “You 
may have heard Dr. Pech of the 
Advancement Authority is stil hos- 
pitalized as a result of what 
happened at Chaim Aleuker’s?” 

“I was there.” 

“Well! So that’s how you met the 



chief. Ah — as I was saying. Dr. 
Satamori has gone to call on Dr. 
Pech in the hospital, but if you’d 
care to wait he said he wouldn’t be 
long, maybe another twenty 
minutes at most. Would you prefer 
to come back? Or have him call 
you?” 

A vast weariness was pervading 
Hans’s mind now. The echo of the 
advice he had been given by Mus- 
tapha was fading away, as though 
the effect of the tranquilizing drink 
had muted the impact of the words. 
Overlaying it now were deep, deep 
emotions — frustration, disappoint- 
ment, horror. He said gruffly, “No, 
I guess I’d rather not wait. But if 
you can give me a piece of paper 
and an envelope I’d like to leave a 
npte.” 

“Surely. Here you are.” 

He sat down, wrote the note — no 
more than ten lines — reread it and 
sealed the envelope and handed it 
over. Then he headed for the skel- 
ter without another word. 

“Hey,” the young man said and 
then much louder and far more ur- 
gently, “Hey! That’s not — ” 

He had a clear sight of the nine- 
digit code Hans was punching. And 
it was not one you’d expect a 
traveler to select. 

UT tried to stop him before he 
A finished composing all nine 
digits!” the young man mourned. 
“One gets into the habit of auto- 
matically glancing at what people 
are punching, just in case — ” 



174 



GALAXY 




“Stop blaming yourself,” Sata- 
mori said glacially, seated at his 
desk and reading for the third or 
fourth time the note Hans had left. 
“You weren’t to know in advance 
he was punching the code for an 
incinerator.” 

He glanced at the skelter in the 
corner of his office and could not 
repress a shudder. 

“That will be all,” he added and 
the young man went out, shaking 
his head as automatically as a 
porcelain mandarin. 

Alone, Satamori stared at the 
note and tried to consult in his 
mind with Chaim Aleuker, with 
Boris Pech, with the miserable girl 
whom his agents had luckily caught 
up with in — of all places — the Sey- 
chelles and who would probably be 
fit to take her place in society in a 
few years’ time after treatment by 
Karl Bonetti. He fancied he could 
hear all their voices, blended into a 
single voice, inside his head. They 
agreed, they concurred, they were 
unanimous. 

The note said that Mustapha 
Sharif had for years been guilty of 
selling illegal codes to abandoned 
houses. Several of the actual codes 
were listed. 

“But I know him,” Satamori 
said under his breath. “I respect 
him. More importantly, I like him, 
even though we’re forever arguing. 
To see him braced? No, to treat 
him so would be unworthy. What- 
ever his reasons, I’m sure they were 
justified. And he’s always said, 



rightly, that we must never put an 
absolute straitjacket of rules and 
regulations around the world again. 
Maybe what brought us to the 
Blowup was the simple operation of 
an inflexible natural law. Equally, 
it might have been the excessive 
constriction of inflexible man-made 
laws. Man likes to be free. When 
he’s fettered he gets angry and 
lashes out.” 

He reached his decision. Rising, 
he walked to his private skelter and 
tossed the note to its floor. Then, at 
the full stretch of his arm, he com- 
posed the same nine-digit code that 
had taken Hans Dykstra on the 
longest of all journeys so far made 
possible by the skelter — the longest 
that ever would be possible, in- 
deed — and the note followed Hans 
into eternity. 

Satamori returned to his desk. 
There was as always much work to 
be done.
