S UITABLY, Edgar Dainton Dainton nodded. He was a

“They’ve turned it down, kindly, mild-mannered and 
E. D.,” said Fackley. “We’re reasonable, 
pulling out of Bullance. They “What was said about my

shareholders — Bullance is a “Well, you can go ahead 
white elephant — under the with it,” Fackley said. “But 
present government regula- there was a strong recommen-

dation not to throw your 
money away. And you know 
how I feel, E. D. — it wouldn’t 
be a worthwhile gamble. If 
you lose, you lose not only 
your money but prestige as 
well.” 

“I know,” said Dainton. 

In an economic empire 
there is no life membership 
for dictators. Dainton was the 
director of the PDC program, 
but what he said only went 
when it paid off. And Bul- 
lance wasn’t paying off. Dain- 
ton wanted to keep trying; 
everybody else wanted to cut 
their losses. 

Now Dainton had offered 
to finance from his own pock- 
et one last try. And what 
Fackley said was undeniably 
true — if the last try failed, 
Dainton would lose face as 
well as money. He would have 
been expensively wrong. PDC 
directors weren’t supposed to 
be expensively wrong, even 
when they footed the bill 
themselves. 

It was a gamble for big 
stakes. If it came off, every- 
body would remember (or 
would be gently reminded if 
they didn’t) that Dainton had 
opposed PDC’s withdrawal 
from Bullance and had taken 
over the account personally 
because the board had turned 
down all his recommenda- 
tions. He would probably sell 
back the rights for a colossal 
sum, his prestige rocketing 
sky-high as well as his bank 
account. But if it didn’t come 



off, it would always be re- 
membered that he’d been 
badly wrong once, and could 
be badly wrong again. 

“When I told them you 
wanted ninety-five per cent 
of the profits,” said Fackley, 
“they didn’t even haggle. 
They just said, ‘What profits?’ 
You’re not going ahead with 
it, are you, E. D.?”- 
Dainton glanced at his 
watch. “Barr’s due in a few 
minutes. I’ll make a final deci- 
sion when I meet him.” 
Fackley hesitated. He was 
a very able and intensely loyal 
assistant. “If you’re doing 
this on Miss Dainton’s ac- 
count ... I mean, I know you 
intend to senu her with him 
, . I mean . 

“What do you mean, Paul?” 
Dainton asked gently. 

“Just that I think the board 
would understand if^ou have 
private reasons. If you mean 
the project to be a flop, for 
reasons of your own . .” 
“Now why would I want 
that?” 

“Well, if you do, let me 
drop a hint to the members of 
the board. Then at least they 
won’t start to question your 
judgment.” 

Dainton smiled slightly. 
‘Thanks, Paul. You’re smart 
and you’re loyal. I wish be- 
tween us we’d been able to 
make Roxie marry you.” 
Fackley flushed slightly. 
“That’s over.” 

“I know,” Dainton sighed. 
"Pity.” 



ABSOLUTE POWER

II 



F ar below in the gargantu- 
an PDC building, Lyn 
Barr was looking about him 
with the naive curiosity of the 
hick he was. In the vast hall 
of the PDC Building a thou- 
sand tiny planets revolved 
rapidly round a hundred tiny 
suns. The display must have 
cost a million to install and 
several thousand a year to 
run. 

“Yes?” said a supercilious 
blonde. 

“I want to see somebody 
called Dainton.” 

The blonde smiled a super- 
cilious smile. “I’m sorry, sir. 
Perhaps you’d care to see Mr. 
Decker. He — ” 

“Decker didn’t ask to see 
me.” 

Her plucked brows rose in- 
credulously. “You mean you 
have an appointment with 
Mr. Dainton? Mr. Edgar 
Dainton?” 

“He said for me to come at 
four,” said Lyn patiently. “I 
guess he only wants to bluster 
and bawl me out because I 
just took five thousand off 
him, but—” 

“Mr. Dainton could give a 
bellhop five thousand and 
never notice it,” the blonde 
said with a wintry smile. 

“Maybe. You ever know a 
millionaire who didn’t scream 
blue murder if somebody gyp- 
ped him out of a dime?” 

Still incredulous, the blonde 
snapped a switch. A few sec- 

8 



onds later, incoherently apol- 
ogetic, she was taking him up 
personally in an elevator. 

An express elevator was 
something new in Lyn’s ex- 
perience. The floor tried to 
come up and hit him, but he 
stiffened his knees just in time 
and kept it where it was. 
When the elevator stopped at 
the top of the immensely tall 
building, he glanced down at 
the blonde’s neat ankles. 

“Thought your panties 
might have fallen down,” he 
explained. “But then, your 
pants would never fall down, 
would they?” 

About to become icily su- 
percilious again, the blonde 
remembered that this man 
was about to see Edgar Dain- 
ton. She tried to laugh as if 
at a scintillating witticism. 

In the large, bright room at 
the top of the building, Dain- 
ton and Lyn Barr eyed each 
other. 

“I got the five thousand all 
right, Mr. Dainton,” Lyn said 
pleasantly. “Thanks for ask- 
ing.” 

“How did you find out about 
that?” Dainton said. 

“I always read the small 
print. When I came from 
Mars on one of your ships, 
naturally I had to look at the 
conditions. And I found this 
clause: 17S (a) Compensation 
(transfer in space) : Should 
it be necessary to transfer 
passengers to another ship in 
space, except as under 178 
(a) and (c), compensation of 

j. T. McIntosh 




five thousand dollars will be 
paid to said passengers on 
demand.” 

“You knew, of course,” said 
Dainton, “that that clause 
dated from the time when 
transfers were hazardous and 
people had to be assured that 
there wouldn’t be any? And 
that for the last hundred 
years or so there have always 
been transfers from tender to 
ship and back to tender?” 

Lyn smiled, “But this clause 
is still there in black and 
white among the conditions.” 

“Was,” Dainton said, “It’s 
out now.” 

The two men looked at each 
other. And though Dainton 
was thirty years older than 
Barr, small and plump instead 
of tall and thin, and neatly 
dressed instead of shambling 
and untidy, they saw they had 
a good deal in common. 

They were both patient 
men. They liked to see what 
was to be seen before com- 
mitting themselves further. It 
would obviously be rare for 
either of them to lose his tem- 
per. They would be kind to old 
ladies in the street. Women 
would like them, believing er- 
roneously they needed moth- 
ering. Neither of them would 
have any difficulty in getting 
children to accept them as 
equals. 

“So you didn’t bring me 
here to swear at me?” Lyn 
asked. 

“I brought you here to give 
you a hundred thousand.” 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



Lyn showed no sign of 
shock. “I’ll take it.” 

“Barr, would you say you 
were a gambler?” 

Lyn considered the matter 
with the grave curiosity of a 
man who is often mildly sur- 
prised, rarely startled. “No, I 
guess not,” he said at last. 

“But it wouldn’t surprise 
you to know that many people 
think you are?” 

“No, it wouldn’t.” 

"I’ve had you closely in- 
vestigated, Barr, I’m going to 
offer you a job, a very im- 
portant job. I think you’re 
enough of a gambler to take 
it on these terms : If you fail, 
living expenses and fifty a 
week. If you succeed, the same 
living expenses, the same fif- 
ty, and a bonus of a hundred 
thousand.” 

“What makes you think I 
could handle a job like that?” 
“The conviction that you 
can do other things besides 
reading small print. But 
there’s something I have to 
tell you before you say any 
more. Not about the job it- 
self — that’s straightforward 
enough. Impossible, probably, 
but quite straightforward. 
What I want to tell you about 
is something that goes with 
the job.” 

L yn waited, but Dainton 
seemed to be waiting for 
a comment. So Lyn asked: 
“What goes with the job?” 
“My daughter Roxie,” said 
Dainton. 

9 




“I guess you don’t mean 
Fm supposed to marry her.” 
“You guess right. Not that 
I’d mind. I’d rather she mar- 
ried you than the fool she 
no doubt will marry when 
she finds somebody useless 
enough. But she won’t marry 
you. When I say she goes with 
the job, I mean that I pro- 
pose to send you to Bullance 
as Premier, and Roxie with 
you.” 

“Premier?” said Lyn, al- 
most astonished. “And you 
think Fm a gambler?” 

Dainton smiled. “I never 
denied that I was. This is one 
of my biggest gambles, Barr. 
Along with that, I want to 
turn Roxie into a normal, 
healthy girl of twenty-two 
with no more than the usual 
emotional problems. If you 
can do that, Bullance can go 
to hell.” 

Lyn’s memory stirred. Even 
on Mars he ha^ heard of the 
Young Daintons. “Wasn’t 
there — didn’t she have a 
brother?” 

“Willie. He was always vio- 
lent with his girl friends. Fi- 
nally he killed one and shot 
himself rather than face trial. 
Somebody might save Roxie, 
though, if he was patient and 
good at reading small print. 
She isn’t all bad.” 

“Let’s get this straight. Is 
my job premiership of Bul- 
lance or psychiatrist to Rox- 
ie? And if it’s the latter, am 
I supposed to cure her or 
marry her or both?” 

10 



“Your job is to be Premier 
of Bullance and work out a 
solution there. So far nobody 
has got within light-years of 
solving it. In your spare time, 
do what you can about Roxie 
— if anybody can do anj^ing 
about Roxie. Marry her if you 
like, and if you can.” 

Dainton sighed. Lyn didn’t 
have to be told what he was 
thinking. Dainton was think- 
ing about two children he had 
never seemed to have time 
for, two children who had al- 
ways had absolutely every- 
thing except the love of a 
father and a mother — or, for 
that matter, anyone. 

“You still haven’t answered 
my question,” said Lyn. 
“Which is my job?” 

Dainton pulled himself to- 
gether. “A good man can do 
three or four things at once, 
and I think you might be a 
good man. Save Bullance and 
you get a hundred grand at 
least — probably a lot more. 
Save Roxie, and ... no, I 
won’t ask for too much. Do 
anything for Roxie and you’ll 
find me more grateful than 
about Bullance. If there’s any 
conflict between the two 
things, Bullance can go to hell 
if you car. do anything for 
Roxie. And, Barr, if Roxie 
tells me one thing and you say 
another, I don’t think I’m go- 
ing to believe Roxie.” 

Lyn always liked time to 
think things over. But he 
knew already that he was go- 
ing to take the job Dainton 

j. T. McIntosh 




offered, for about six different 
reasons. 

“Why,” he asked, “are you 
so sure your daughter will go 
with me?” 

“She wants to be a premier 
on a primitive world,” said 
Dainton bleakly. “And I’ve 
told her she has no chance un- 
less she does this first. She 
has no chance anyway.” 

“Why not?” 

“The reason she wants to 
rule a world is to prove that 
Ghengis Khan, Hitler and the 
Russian revolutionaries were 
humanitarian, sentimental 
philanthropists.” 

“Yet you say she isn’t all 
bad?” 

“I think she isn’t,” said 
Dainton quietly. “But maybe 
I’m biased, being her father.” 

Ill 

O N THE company ship out 
to Bullance, Lyn saw very 
little of Roxie Dainton. It 
wasn’t until the ship was 
nearly due to land that all the 
young officers on board had 
become heartily sick of Roxie. 
The stewardesses, of course, 
had been sick of her from the 
start. 

Lyn knew that he must in 
due course clash violently 
with Roxie, and was quite 
satisfied to postpone hostilities 
until they were on Bullance 
and the Meredith had left. He 
had divided his time between 
winning money from anyone 
on board ship who would play 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



any gambling game with him 
and reading about Bullance. 

Bullance was a pleasant 
enough world, apart from be- 
ing slightly too hot. Its air 
and water were non-poison- 
ous, the highest life-form — 
about twenty per cent less in- 
telligent than humans — was 
friendly and completely harm- 
less, and no other animal on 
the planet was larger than a 
cat. 

Like most friendly, harm- 
less worlds, Bullance had very 
little to offer Terran civiliza- 
tion. In fact, only one com- 
modity was worth exporting. 

It seemed to be almost a 
natural law that if a world 
was vicious, poisonous, un- 
stable and in other respects 
highly dangerous, it was in- 
variably rich in things Earth- 
men wanted. And if it was as 
harmless as Bullance, it pro- 
duced practically nothing of 
any value. 

Simple economics thus en- 
sured that all the important 
settlements were on extreme- 
ly tough worlds. Bullance was 
too far from any thickly popu- 
lated world to have any value 
as a vacation resort; conse- 
quently any colony there had 
to depend on what it could 
produce for necessities, and 
on what it could export for 
luxuries. 

The one commodity which 
Bullance did export was very 
valuable, and if it could have 
been exported in quantity, 
Bullance could have become 

n 




wealthy. This was so far from 
being &e case that PDC had 
already ceased to subsidize the 
small settlement that existed 
there, and it owed its present 
precarious existence to Edgar 
Dainton’s personal backing. 

Called manna without any 
particular originality or im- 
agination, Bullance’s one valu- 
able commodity was partly 
natural and partly manufac- 
tured by the highest life-form, 
a humanoid species with gray 
skin known officially as Bulla- 
nese and unofficially as Mani- 
acs (because they brought in 
manna). The Maniacs per- 
formed a long and complicated 
process with the sap of cer- 
tain trees, a mash of leaves, 
different kinds of soil and a 
common form of gelatin. 

The result was manna, the 
Maniac’s staple diet. It would 
have been a great delicacy 
back on Earth but for the fact 
that hardly anybody could af- 
ford to eat it. Occasionally 
some very rich man on Earth 
would invite a very few guests 
to dinner and serve manna. 
He rarely did it again if he 
wanted to remain a very rich 
man. 

Most of the manna that was 
brought in from Bullance was 
used in the production of ex- 
pensive plastics which could 
not be given the same quali- 
ties by any other process. 
Some was used in fabulous 
ceramics. It also produced the 
finest possible film base, used 
with the thinnest emulsions 

12 



when great enlargement was 
required. 

There was no difficulty in 
selling manna for great sums. 
The difficulty was in getting 
it. 

The only way to produce it 
was the way the Maniacs pro- 
duced it on Bullance. And un- 
fortunately manna didn’t keep 
much longer than the time 
taken to transport it to Earth. 
So the supply of manna de- 
pended (a) on the Bullanese 
bringing it in, and (b) on 
their bringing it in at the 
right time and in the right 
quantities. 

Lyn had before him the 
exasperating story of manna 
supplies brought to the PDC 
base on Bullance. In January, 
2175, stock was 170 tons — 
more than a shipload. But the 
next ship to call arrived in 
May, by which time only 10 
tons were still consignable. 
Shortly after the ship had 
left, the Bullanese supplied a 
further 110 tons. By Novem- 
ber, when the next ship was 
due, only five tons were fresh 
enough to stand the journey. 

It wasn’t that the ships 
called at the wrong time of 
year. Their schedules had 
been changed repeatedly. It 
wasn’t that the Bullanese 
were not prepared to supply 
manna. It was simply that 
there seemed to be no way of 
getting them to bring in sup- 
plies at the right time, or 
know when the next big sup- 
ply was coming. 

J. T. MclNTOSH 




Everything seemed to have 
been tried. Once a ship had 
been kept waiting indefinitely 
on Bullance, ready to blast 
off whenever she was fully 
loaded. When she did blast 
off, a year and four months 
later, she was only half full, 
because by the time the last 
small quantities of manna 
had been brought in, the first 
bales had gone bad and had to 
be unloaded. Half a shipload 
was an exceedingly valuable 
cargo — but the cost of keep- 
ing a ship and her crew idle 
for sixteen months was ruin- 
ous. Besides, the crew was 
near mutiny by the time the 
ship finally left Bullance, and 
when she got back to Earth 
the various unions inserted 
clauses in their contracts for- 
bidding a stay of more than 
a month on Bullance. 

No wonder, Lyn thought, 
the PDC board had decided 
to cut their losses in Bullance. 
What he didn’t understand 
was what Dainton hoped he, 
Lyn Barr, was going to ac- 
complish. 

Still, Lyn was quite pre- 
pared to try to find a solution. 
He was always prepared to 
try. 

IV 

«TTI,” SAID Roxie. She 
hadn’t knocked. “Am I 
interrupting anything?” 

“Could I be anything but 
delighted?” said Lyn, pushing 
his book aside. 

“Can’t you do better than 



that?” She threw herself 
moodily on the locker, which 
was the only item of furniture 
in the tiny cabin other than 
the folded bed on which Lyn 
was sitting. 

She wore a vivid scarlet 
skirt with hundreds of pleats 
and a blazing yellow blouse 
stretched tightly across 
breasts which could stand it. 
She was neither tall nor 
short, neither blonde nor 
brunette, but if she hadn’t 
been Roxie Dainton she could 
have been a showgirl. If she 
was twisted and frustrated, 
it certainly wasn’t because 
she was ugly. 

“Look,” she said, “I don’t 
get it. Why is my father send- 
ing you to Bullance?” 

“Because he thought I 
might see a way of making 
manna imports pay.” 

“Oh, that’s censored,” she 
said impatiently. “He’s pay- 
ing you to do a nursemaid job 
On me, isn’t he? He doesn’t 
give a tinker’s damn about 
Bullance.” 

Lyn shook his head. “Bul- 
lance could and ought to be a 
gold mine. Why it isn’t is be- 
cause no matter what the 
market value of manna is, a 
shipload of ten tons every six 
months won’t pay all the ex- 
penses. Forty tons would. And 
if we could guarantee a ship- 
load every month — ” 

“Don’t be a bloody fool. 
Think I don’t know anything 
about Bullance? Kick the 
Maniacs around and there

won’t be any more trouble 
with them.” 

“Unfortunately,” said Lyn 
carefully, “there’s a govern- 
ment inspector permanently 
on the station to prevent just 
that. The Bullanese have legal 
rights, same as anybody 
else.” 

“Do it when he isn’t look- 
ing, then.” 

“I’m afraid that won’t 
work. The Bullanese would 
simply move away from the 
PDC station and there 
wouldn’t be any manna at 
all.” 

“Let’s cut the pretense,” 
she said angrily. “What’s 
your real job?” 

Lyn leaned back comforta- 
bly on the bed. “I’m supposed 
to make Bullance pay. That 
means getting more manna 
exports^ somehow. Naturally, 
this ship will take back any 
manna which happens to be 
waiting when we land. I can 
neither take credit if there’s 
a lot nor be blamed if there 
isn’t. But in two months’ time 
another ship is coming, a spe- 
cial ship, and it’s my job to 
arrange that there’ll be a 
cargo of manna waiting for 
it. That’s my job. That’s what 
I’m here for.” 

“For God’s sake, stop talk- 
ing about manna. I’m sick of 
hearing about the censored 
stuff. You’re supposed to turn 
me into a solid citizen, aren’t 
you?” 

Lyn was quite prepared to 
follow that line. “What par- 

14 



ticular objection do you have 
to solid citizens?” 

She twitched her skirt im- 
patiently. “They’re boring.” 
“It seems to me,” said Lyn, 
“that you spend most of your 
time being bored anyway, 
whether you’re surrounded by 
solid citizens or not.” 

She sighed. “It’s true, damn 
it. You think I believe I’m' the 
most important thing in the 
Galaxy, don’t you?” 

“I haven’t had much oppor- 
tunity to make up my mind 
what you think.” 

“You think I’m stinking 
with pride, don’t you?” 

“No,” said Lyn. “I think 
that nobody has a lower opin- 
ion of Roxie Dainton than 
you have.” 

S HE blinked and gasped. 

“Well, that was a poke in 
the gut,” she said. “You 
think you're smart, don’t 
you ?” 

“Not as smart as I’d like to 
be,” said Lyn. 

“You must be smart. The 
old man doesn’t pick fools. 
How are you going to set to 
work on me?” 

“Miss Dainton,” said Lyn 
firmly, “whether you believe 
me or not is your affair, but 
my immediate concern is the 
supply of manna and I have 
no qualifications as a doctor, 
psychiatrist or priest. If I 
were supposed to be a big 
brother to you, would I have 
kept out of your way the 
whole voyage?” 



j. T. McIntosh 




"You might have,” Roxie 
said thoughtfully, “if you 
were smart. By this time I’m 
fed up with everybody on this 
ship, and everybody is fed up 
with me — except you.” 

“How could people get fed 
up with a girl like you?” 
“Don’t act dumb.” 

“I’m not acting.” 

She threw up a leg rest- 
lessly and the shoe sailed off 
her foot across the cabin. Her 
skirt slid up and she didn’t 
bother to pull it down again. 
“Why should I tell you?” 

“No reason, only that if you 
don’t like to talk about your- 
self, there must really be 
something unusual about 
you.” 

“I guess you’re right,” she 
said moodily. “I guess nothing 
interests me much any more 
except seeing people squirm. 
It’s always possible to make 
them squirm, you know. You 
think now that I’ll never 
make you writhe, but you’re 
wrong. You’ll squirm just like 
everybody else.” 

“Women too?” 

“Women are easiest. They 
are always in competition 
and I win because I don’t 
want what the other girl 
wants; I only want to win. 
You know Mary Shearing, the 
night stewardess? She’s crazy 
over Porter. Porter’s married, 
but that doesn’t matter. On 
the Meredith Porter is all 
hers, and that’s something his 
wife can never share. Well, 
I made her say I couldn’t take 



Porter away from her, and 
then I took Porter away from 
her. I didn’t sleep with him 
because he was easier to han- 
dle with his tongue hanging 
out. I made him fight with 
Mary and tell her she made 
him sick and he was going to 
get away from her if he had 
to transfer to another ship or 
another company. I made her 
tell him she wouldn’t have 
anything to do with him if he 
was the last man alive. 'Then 
I kicked Porter out and never 
spoke to him again.” 

“Very pretty,” Lyn said. 
“Maybe I haven’t heard about 
these things because I’m sup- 
posed to be a big wheel and 
might get somebody fired. I 
gather Mary and Porter are 
not the only two who hate 
you?” 

“I got Benning crazy for 
me too. I had him where he 
thought he was really getting 
someplace, and then kicked 
him out as well. I found out 
that Brenda Cowley took his 
job because her second child 
is a spastic and needs expen- 
sive care. It’s easy to make 
her writhe ... You see, there 
is always a way.” 

“And that makes you feel 
good?” 

“No,” said Roxie bleakly, 
“it makes me feel the same 
way you would feel if you 
did it.” 

T here was a long silence, 
quite a companionable si- 
lence, for though Lyn could 

15 



ABSOLUTE POWER 




see why people hated Roxie, 
he didn't hate her. You could 
not hate anybody you pitied. 

At last she said: “It was 
the old man’s fault. He gave 
me everything except what I 
needed. I know now that no- 
body should ever get all he 
asks for. But it’s too late.” 
“You said it. I didn’t.” 
“And it’s true. At eighteen, 
if I’d met the right man . 
But now I’m twenty-two. 
That’s four years of doing 
anything to make people 
squirm. It’s too late now.” 
“Well, if you want me to 
agree, I will.” 

She stood up. “No, I don’t 
want you to agree. I’m God 
damned if I know what I 
want.” 

“Watch your language. 
There’s a lady present.” 

She stared down at him. 
“Are you telling me how to 
behave, nursemaid?” 

“No. Only how not to talk.” 
Suddenly she laughed, a 
hard, jeering laugh. “If 
swearing shocks you, I guess 
you don’t have any idea what 
I’m like. Want to know why 
I want to be premier of a 
world like Bullance?” 

“I can guess.” 

Her eyes became slits and 
she almost snarled. “To be in 
control of a world — in sole 
command, the boss, the one 
person with absolute power — 
that’s the one thing I haven’t 
tried. To have the power of 
life and death, to make peo- 
ple crawl, to think up the 

16 



craziest things and make peo* 
pie do them, to be able to beat 
natives to death ... I’d do 
anything for that power.” 

Lyn said nothing. 

She looked at him, the 
cruelty already beginning to 
die out of her face. But for 
a moment he had seeh the hell 
behind her eyes. He began for 
the first time to believe that 
it really was too late, that she 
was rotten all the way 
through. 

Perhaps she guessed this, 
for as her eyes met his she 
suddenly spun on her heel and 
went out of the cabin, leaving 
her shoe behind. 

V 

B ullance was a hot, 

moist world, a yellow- 
green hell. Not trusting the 
local insects, both Lyn and 
Roxie were wearing protec- 
tive coveralls as they emerged 
from the ship. 

“Jesus!” said Roxie as the 
heat hit them, and for once 
Lyn felt blasphemy was jus- 
tified. 

Within a couple of minutes 
they found that there were 
five tons of fresh manna wait- 
ing, and two hundred tons 
spoiled. Joe Gunther, the PDC 
base commander, jumped 
around in his vexation. “If 
the ship had been four months 
earlier,” he said to Lyn, al- 
most in tears, “practically all 
the loss on the Bullance books 
would have been paid up!” 

j. T. McIntosh 




Lyn wondered if it was 
really impossible to keep a 
ship waiting on Bullance, 
ready to blast off whenever 
she was fully loaded. How- 
ever, he didn’t weaken his 
position as PHC trouble- 
shooter by making what 
might be a silly suggestion. 

Gunther’s jumping about 
irritated Roxie. “Why don’t 
you just lash out instead of 
holding it in?” she demanded. 

Gunther started to say 
something he might have re- 
^T6ttG(l* 

“This,” said Lyn, “is Miss 
Roxanne Dainton.” 

Gunther checked himself 
immediately. “Delighted to 
make your acquaintance. Miss 
Dainton,” he gasped. “Glad 
you found yourself able to 
visit Bullance. We’ll show you 
as much as we can before the 
Meredith blasts off.” 

“She’s not going back with 
the ship,” said Lys. “She’s 
staying here.” 

Gunther goggled. Before he 
could say anything, Roxie 
saw something silvery moving 
in the jungle and exclaimed: 
“Look! Is that one of the 
Maniacs ?” 

Gunther recovered himself. 
“We don’t use that word. 
Miss Dainton,” he said, play- 
fully chiding. “The Bullanese 
have enough sense to realize 
that the term is derogatory 
and—” 

“I’ll call them what I bloody 
well like.” 

Lyn thought the opportu- 
ABSOLUTE POWER 



nity as good as any to show 
how things stood. “No, Miss 
Dainton. If you look at the 
terms of my contract, you'll 
find that I can send yo'.. right 
back on the ship if you don’t 
behave yourself.” 

For a moment it looked as 
if Roxie would explode. Then 
her fury blew itself out in 
irritation. “What the hell does 
it matter what you call the 
lousy bugs?” She calmed her- 
self down. “Okay, I’ll call 
them Bullanese, Boss.” 

Gunther’s eyes widened 
again. Neither the way Roxie 
talked nor the way this man 
Barr treated her was what he 
would have expected. 

They were standing outside 
the PDC base, a large white 
building at one side of a hqge 
clearing which was used as a 
landing field both for space- 
ships and the landplanes the 
base staff used. 

I T WAS obvious at a glance 
that Bullance was an alien 
world. The predominant color 
was a startling yellow-green, 
with tomato reds a close sec- 
ond. Nearly all the bushes and 
trees had the same basic 
shape, a strange one to people 
from Earth. Strong, hard 
trunks which drew up no 
moisture held the main bodies 
of the plants well clear of the 
ground. Temporary roots at 
the end of springy arms dug 
themselves down into rich 
soil, ready to fly up out of 
danger when touched, leaving 

17 




only expendable tips to their 
fate. Most of the herbivorous 
animals of Bullance were very 
small, and plants had develop- 
ed in this way for self- 
defense. 

“That’s Zin,” said Gunther, 
as the Bullanese emerged 
from the bush. “And I can 
guess what he wants.” He 
sighed. 

“First time I ever saw a 
bug with clothes on,” said 
Roxie. 

Bullanese were not insects, 
yet it was not unnatural that 
Roxie should choose to call 
them bugs. There was a cer- 
tain insectlike exaggeration 
of even their humanoid char- 
acteristics. They had big 
heads, tiny chests, bulbous 
pelvises and long, spindly 
limbs, and their skin, though 
soft and very like human skin, 
was a slaty gray color which 
gave it the appearance of 
being a shell. Nevertheless, 
they could be quite attractive 
in an alien kind of way, for 
instead of the awkwardness 
which would have meant ugli- 
ness, their movements had a 
smoothness and grace which 
had beauty in it. It was mere- 
ly not a human beauty. 

They were attractive as the 
long-limbed pixies drawn by 
human artists were attrac- 
tive. Their clothing helped. 
Zin wore a V-shaped breech- 
cloth which made his pelvis 
look less bulbous and a loose 
jacket like a bolero, both in 
a brilliant orange material 

18 



like satin, but . finer and 
brighter. 

Zin ignored Lyn altogether, 
looked curiously and doubt- 
fully at Roxie, nodded his 
head and began to speak in 
a high singsong voice to 
Gunther. 

One of the first things he 
must do, Lyn decided, was 
learn the language. Gunther 
might or might not resent 
him, though, if he did, he had 
given no indication of the 
fact so far, but it wouldn’t do 
to be able to communicate 
with the Bullanese only 
through Gunther. 

Roxie fidgeted impatiently 
in the throbbing heat as the 
conversation went on and on. 
Presently she shrugged, un- 
zipped her coveralls and strip- 
ped them off. Her shorts were 
very short. 

When the discussion was 
finished, Zin shot another cu- 
rious glance at Roxie. This 
time he was flabbergasted. In 
the first place, he hadn’t seen 
her take off her coveralls and 
the transformation appeared 
to strike him as magical. In 
the second place, the lines of 
her body, previously conceal- 
ed, now could hardly have 
been more obvious, and Zin 
clearly had never seen any 
lines like them. 

As he went away he kept 
glancing back over his shoul- 
der at Roxie. He seemed re- 
luctant to go at all. 

“You’ve made a hit. Miss 
Dainton,” said Lyn. 

j. T. McIntosh 




She turned on him irrita- 
bly. “Are you doing that to 
annoy me?” 

“Doing what?” asked Lyn. 

“Calling me Miss Dainton.” 

“No. I’ll call you anything 
you like.” But Lyn spoke ab- 
sently. He wanted to hear 
what Joe Gunther had to say. 
Gunther wasn’t looking 
happy. 

‘The Bullanese want a ton 
of manna back,” said Gun- 
ther. “That means only four 
tons for the Meredith.” 

“Don’t tell me you’re going 
to give them it!” Roxie ex- 
claimed. 

“Have to. They only bring 
it in on condition that they 
can have it back if they need 
it. I told him they could have 
all the spoiled manna too. It’s 
no good to us.” 

“What good is it to them?” 
Lyn asked. 

“They make cloth with it. 
Like what he was wearing.” 

Manna was very useful 
stuff, apparently. The mate- 
rial Zin had worn would 
command a high price on 
Earthj perhaps enough to 
make it worth while shipping 
it. Another thing for Lyn 
Barr to look into. 

“Shall we go into the 
base?” Gunther said. 

“Bloody high time,” Roxie 
grumbled. 

VI 

W HEN Lyn decided to go 
out for a walk after 
lunch, he found to his sur- 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



prise that Roxie wanted to go 
with him. Perhaps “wanted” 
was too strong a word to de- 
scribe her sullen admission 
that she wouldn’t mind com- 
ing along. 

“It would be an unexpected 
pleasure,” he said. “But I’m 
only going to have a look 
around.” 

“I know.” She swore sud- 
denly. “I’ve a good mind to 
go back on the Meredith.” 
“Why?” Lyn asked. If 
Roxie went, half his job went 
too, but he wouldn’t be sorry. 
The problem of manna sup- 
plies interested him and he 
would be quite happy to con- 
centrate entirely on that. 

“There are twenty-nine 
human beings on Bullance,” 
said Roxie bitterly, “and you 
and I are the only two under 
forty.” 

Ljm smiled slightly. “You 
could have found that out be- 
fore you came.” 

“The Meredith isn’t blast- 
ing off until tomorrow. Why 
is the crew still cooped up in 
it? Why don’t they come out 
and stretch their legs?” 
“We’ve been immunizect 
against Bullanese bacteria 
and they haven’t. It wouldn’t 
be worth the trouble and the 
expense. If there was any- 
thing to do or see on Bul- 
lance, it would be different.” 
The subtle approach seemed 
to be working. Roxie’s frown 
became blacker. But then ab- 
ruptly she seemed to sense 
what Lyn was thinking. “Why 

19 




don’t you want me to stay 
here?” 

“If you believe that,” said 
Lyn, “you can’t believe any 
more that my job is to be a 
nursemaid to you.” 

“Maybe I don’t. Why do 
you want to get rid of me? Am 
I ugly?, Do you hate women?” 
“You’re not ugly and if you 
were anybody but Roxie 
Dainton I’d be glad for you 
to stay.” 

“What does that mean?” 
Lyn looked at her thought- 
fully. She iiJvV wore green- 
and-white striped shorts and 
halter. She was spectacular, 
all right. 

“All the men on th- station 
yDU could possibly ’u' inter- 
ested in are married arl have 
their wives with them,” he 
said patiently. “And. as you 
have already pointed out, they 
are all over forty. Neverthe- 
less, within a week you’ll have 
the base in an uproar.” 

She liked thet. “I gues,"; Se.” 
“That’s nothing to be pioud 
of. Any other bitch as young 
and pretty as you could do the 
same.” 

“Who are you calling a 
bitch?” 

“My jo*' will be a hell of 
a lot easier if you go home.” 
“Who’s swearing now?” 

“I don’t use words like you 
do.” 

“Like these?” she said, and 
listed them. 

Lyn didn’t hesitate. He Look 
her by the shoulder a." ’ led 
her into one of the waslirooms 



just inside the base. She didn’t 
struggle until he began to 
push her over a basin, 

“What the hell do you think 
you’re doing?” she demanded. 

“You wash your body, 
don’t you?” he said. “You 
wouldn’t like it to be offen- 
sive. Well, your mouth is.” 

H e bent her back over 
the sink. Although she 
fought violently, she was 
Jielpless, unable to make the 
best use of her strength or 
tear him with her nails. 
Holding her wrists above her 
head with one hand, he cram- 
med soap in her mouth. 

Not for quite a while did he 
release her, by w-hich time her 
teeth and lips were covered 
with soap and her curses were 
smothered in bubbles. When 
she was free she gathered 
herself to dive at him, but 
changed her mind. It was 
more urgent to wash out her 
mouth. 

She did so. Lyn had an op- 
portunity to walk out on her. 
He didn’t take it. 

When she had spat out all 
the soap she straightened to 
face him furiously. Her face 
was red, her hair a mess, and 
one of the straps of her halter 
had snapped. 

“I could kill you!” she 
breathed, and he believed her. 
“You did that so I’d leave on 
the Meredith, didn’t you?” 
“If you want the truth, I 
did it to try to make you talk 
cleaner. How would you feel 



20 



j. T. McIntosh 




if people found out that you 
wore your slip for a month 
without washing it?” 

“You’re crazy. I don’t — ” 

“You talk as if you did.” 
As she appeared to have no 
comeback, he turned to go. “I 
take it I’m no longer to be 
honored with your company ?” 

She shrugged. “You take it 
wrong. I might as well come. 
There’s nothing else for me to 
do.” 

Lyn had had talks with 
Gunther and Dr. Allison, the 
station’s medical officer, to 
supplement his theoretical 
knowledge of Bullance. There 
was no danger from the Bul- 
lanese, no danger from the 
small animals of the jungle, 
no danger at all in walking 
about except the risk of get- 
ting lost, which was slight 
with the station’s radio mast 
to guide them. 

Lyn and Roxie walked in 
silence for a while. There 
were a lot of Bullanese about, 
all staring at Roxie. She ig- 
nored them. 

There was certainly very 
little to see, once the first im- 
pression of >a yellow-green 
and red world had been es- 
tablished. There were no 
mountains in this part of 
Bullance, and no seas. Small 
rivers fed a multitude of 
lakes which were rarely as 
much as a mile long. As far 
as the eye could see there was 
nothing but flat country over- 
grown with yellow-green 
plants and red plants, with 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



an occasional stream or lake 
breaking the monotony. 

“Is there any danger in 
swimming in these lakes?” 
Roxie asked abruptly. 

“None at all. The fish are 
like ours — they stay out of 
the way of anything bigger 
than themselves.” 

“I wish I’d brought a swim- 
suit out here with me.” 

“Bathe without it.” 

She looked at him sharply. 
"Of course I’m shameless 
too?” 

“Well, aren’t you?’V 

She didn’t answer. Nothing 
more was said until she al- 
most tripped over one of the 
Bullanese. “Oh, obscene these 
Maniacs !” she exclaimed irri- 
tably. Her irritation dissolved 
in a grin. “That just came 
out. But it doesn’t matter. 
You’ve got no soap with 
you.” 

It was the first time he had 
seen her smile. He changed 
his mind. Well, why not say 
so? 

“I hope you don’t go back 
in the Meredith,” he said. 

“Obscenity,” she said rude- 
ly. “You’re a nursemaid after 
all.” 

That was why not say so. 
She couldn’t take anything 
resembling a compliment. 

“Did you ever love anybody, 
Roxie?” he asked. 

“Yes, and got kicked in the 
belly.” 

“Naturally. You invited it* 

She frowned. “Huh?” 

“You always get what you 

21 









HS^li 
















want, don’t you?” Lyn said. 

“Obscenity,” she said again, 
and turned and left him. 

VII 

T hat night Gunther told 
Lyn excitedly that twenty- 
five tons of manna had been 
brought in during the day. 

“Isn’t that usual?” Lyn 
asked. “I mean, don’t they 
bring it in when the ship 
arrives?” 

“They never have before. 
You remember, just this 
morning Zin came to ask for 
some back. I thought it would 
be weeks before they brought 
any more.” 

“They seemed very inter- 
ested in Miss Dainton. Could 
that have anything to do with 
that?” 

“Interested? What do you 
mean?” 

“When we went out for a 
walk we saw scores of them. 
They were in every bush, all 
staring at Roxie.” 

Gunther became excited. 
“That’s it, Mr. Barr. That’s 
it! They’re a polite race. If 
they’re curious about some- 
thing around here, they bring 
manna — as an excuse to come 
and watch. It’s happened once 
or twice when we were build- 
ing things or making a dam.” 
“Then I’ll hold back the 
Meredith and make sure the 
Bullanese get a chance to see 
Roxie again tomorrow.” 

“It won’t last. It never does. 
A couple of days, no more.” 



“You’ve tried to make it 
last?” 

“Of course. Offered to teach 
them how to do things. They 
come for two days, bringing 
manna in. Then they stop.” 

“All the same, we’ll keep 
this business going as long as 
we can.” 

That night, before sleeping, 
Lyn considered the possibility 
of turning Roxie into a white 
goddess. The corny tactic, he 
knew, worked more often with 
primitive peoples than it had 
any right to. 

Now what would be a god- 
dess for a race prepared to 
accept a living creature as 
divine? A beautiful creature, 
for a start. Roxie was that, 
even to the Bullanese. Or may- 
be she was fascinatingly ugly. 
It didn’t matter— Roxie still 
had something which the 
other twenty-eight men and 
women at the station obvious- 
ly didn’t have. Next, intelli- 
gence. Well, Roxie was more 
intelligent than a Bullanese 
genius. True, many of the 
other twenty-eight were more 
intelligent, but they didn’t 
look like Roxie. 

Anything he could do to set 
up Roxie as a Bullanese god- 
dess, Lyn was prepared to try. 
Meantime he had given orders 
holding the Meredith for a 
few days — and he no longer 
had any thought of trying to 
persuade Roxie to leave on the 
ship. 

This might be the thing he 
was looking for. 



ABSOLUTE POWER 



23 




Next morning Roxie didn’t 
want to go out. 

The Bullanese never enter- 
ed the station. If Roxie was 
to be on view, she had to go 
out. 

Lyn considered telling Rox- 
ie his real reason, but decided 
against it. He already knew 
that cooperation wasn’t a 
word in her dictionary. 

“Let’s go for a swim,” he 
said. 

“I don’t feel like it.” 

“You’re not ill, are you?” 

“I just don’t feel like it. 
Leave me alone.” 

“Okay,” he said. 

His patience was rewarded. 
An hour later, having search- 
ed for diversion in the station 
and failed to find it, Roxie 
came looking for him, carry- 
ing a towel. 

At first, as they made their 
way to the nearest lake, they 
saw no Bullanese. Then there 
were a few in the bushes. 
Then even more than there 
had been the day before — 
scores, perhaps hundreds. 

Lyn rejoiced, hoping Gun- 
ther was right and they 
wouldn’t come without bring- 
ing manna. 

“I hear the bugs brought in 
twenty-five tons yesterday,” 
Roxie abruptly said. 

“That’s right,” said Lyn 
guardedly. 

“That just shows, doesn’t 
it? They’ve got it all the time, 
stored somewhere. All we 
have to do is beat a few of 
them.” 



“Hobley’s here to stop 
that.” 

“Hobley can be bribed, 
can’t he?” 

“I doubt it. I get the idea 
he’s a little stupid, but con- 
scientious and thoroughly 
honest.” 

“What a dull man he must 
be.” And that marked the end 
of Roxie’s interest in Hobley 
or in manna. 

She had a swimsuit under 
her dress. They bathed for 
half an hour, and Lyn found 
that it was not merely pos- 
sible, but quite easy, to have 
fun with Roxie. She liked 
swimming and was a good 
swimmer. At a pool she could 
be an ordinary girl. 

Afterward, as they lay in 
the hot sun, letting it dry 
them, he wasn’t in any hurry 
to start talking. He knew al- 
ready that conversation with 
Roxie was rather like walk- 
ing a tightrope over a bed of 
nettles. 

“I wanted to go to a danger- 
ous world,” Roxie said, “riot 
one like this.” 

“Why? Want to get killed?” 

“No, but I don’t think I’m 
meant to live long.” 

“You mean you don’t want 
to live long?” 

“I never want to be old.” 
She shuddered. 

“Being old is all right if 
somebody loves you.” 

She laughed her hard, stri- 
dent laugh. “Are you going to 
make love to me ?” 

“No. I’m just telling you 



24 



j. T. McIntosh 




that if you got people to start 
liking you. you could face the 
thought of being old.” 

S HE laughed again, mirth- 
lessly. “When people like 
me, it’s the old man’s millions 
they like.” 

“Not necessarily,” said Lyn 
Barr. 

“How can I tell?” 

“If it was me, you would 
know it. As of now, I don’t 
like you. Despite your father’s 
millions. So, if I suddenly 
started to like you, you’d know 
it was because of you, not 
your father’s millions.” 
“Think I care a damn 
whether you like me or not?” 
she asked scornfully. “If I 
ever fall in love again, it’s not 
likely to be with you.” 

“I’m not talking about love. 
You may not care whether I 
love you or net, but you do 
want me to like you.” 

She was silent for a long 
time. 

There were Bullanese all 
around them, silently watch- 
ing, but it was possible to for- 
get them after a while. Roxie 
seemed to have done so al- 
ready. Lyn didn’t want to for- 
get them. He was keeping 
Roxie on show as long as 
possible. 

“Anyway,” she said bitter- 
ly,, “you don’t like me. You’ve 
said so.” 

“It’s the iruth,” he nodded. 
“But I’m a sin?ple sort of fel- 
low. If you become likeable, 
I’ll like you.” 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



The hard laugh rang out 
again. "So I was right. You’re 
trying to make me a solid 
citizen.” 

“Roxie, do you ever take a 
good look at yourself?” 
“Physically, all the time. 
The way you’re talking about, 
no.” 

“Even if you do, you can’t 
see the important thing. 
People don’t.” 

“And you can?” 

“Yes. You won’t find happi- 
ness, Roxie, in new things, 
things you haven’t experienced 
before, like being premier of 
a PDC world. If you’re ever 
going to find happiness, it’ll 
be in the ordinary things, 
the things you’ve already 
scorned.” 

“When I want a sermon. 
I’ll ask for it.” 

“Sermon or not, Roxie, 
that’s the truth.” 

There was another long si- 
lence. This time Lyn broke it. 
“Anyway,” he said, “I like 
you a lot better today than I 
did yesterday.” 

“Why?” 

“You know why.” 

She didn’t answer, so she 
probably did. She hadn’t been 
obscene or profane all day. 

That day the Bullanese 
brought more than thirty tons 
of manna. 

VIII 

W ITHIN a week the Mere- 
dith was fully loaded, 
and Lyn sent her off with a 

25 




personal letter to Edgar Dain- 
ton. 

It had been agreed that Lyn 
was neither to be blamed if 
the Meredith returned empty 
nor congratulated if she had 
a good load. The real test was 
the size pf the second consign- 
ment, after Lyn had been on 
Bullance for two months. 

However, the Meredith had 
the first full load of fresh 
manna ever to be consigned, 
and Lyn saw no reason why 
he shouldn’t take the credit 
for it. His letter wasn’t mod- 
est ; it was almost cocky. If he 
succeeded, he did not want his 
success to be ascribed to blind 
luck. 

Roxie didn’t leave on the 
Meredith. “I guess I might 
as well stay,” she said grudg- 
ingly. 

Lyn laughed. “You might 
as well.” 

She shot a suspicious glance 
at him. “What’s so funny?” 

“Admit it, Roxie. You’ve 
been happier the last five days 
than you’ve been for years.” 

She shrugged. “Oh, sure. It 
hasn’t been too bad — apart 
from those bugs following me 
around everywhere. I’ve al- 
most been happy. But that’s 
only the first few days. It 
won’t last. It never does.” 

“If you’re determined it 
won’t, it won’t ” 

“Don’t be an idiot,” she said 
irritably. “Of course I want 
to be happy. Who doesn’t? It’s 
just — every time I get around 
to enjoying anything, some- 

26 



thing happens and it all 
crumbles to dust.” 

“Maybe it won’t this time.” 

“Lyn, tell me the truth. 
Please. Did my father hire 
you to try and straighten me 
out? I’ve got to know. Please 
tell me.” 

“If he did,” Lyn observed, 
“I guess I must be doing a 
pretty good job. You just said 
‘please’ twice. You never used 
to do that.” 

“Lyn, tell me the truth. 
Please'." 

“I’m here to arrange man- 
na shipments,” Lyn said care- 
fully. “I told you that and it’s 
true. But your father also said 
that if I could do anything for 
you — that was his phrase, ‘if 
you can do anything for Rox- 
ie’ — Bullance could go to hell.” 

“I see,” Roxie bitterly said. 
“So you’re only obeying or- 
ders. Keeping little Roxie out 
of mischief.” 

“Would I have told you that 
just now if that were all there 
was to it?” 

Her expression was half 
suspicious, half hopeful. He 
knew that she was beginning 
to think she was falling in 
love with him. Whether she 
was right was another matter. 
He certainly wasn’t in love 
with her, and he suspected 
that she was merely respond- 
ing to decent treatment from 
somebody who could take a lot 
without losing his temper. 

“Frankly,” he said, “at first 
I’d have been glad to have you 
leave on the Meredith. I get 

j. T. McIntosh 




a hundred thousand dollars 
if I manage to clear up the 
trouble with manna supplied 
I would have been quite glad 
to get rid of you and concen- 
trate on that. But I changed 
my mind.” 

“When?” 

“That day when I crammed 
soap in your mouth. You 
didn’t bear malice. You came 
out with me afterward. I ad- 
mired you for that, Roxie. I 
hadn’t known you could take 
it as well as handing it out.” 
“Want me to burst into 
tears?” she said in a hard 
voice. 

“Not unless you want to.” 
“Well, I guess if I had a 
heart to break it was broken 
a long time ago.” With sud- 
den vehemence she added : 
“Only, for God’s sake, Lyn, if 
you’re going to try, do it now 
and not later.” 

T he armistice between 

Roxie and L3m lasted for 
nearly a week more without 
incidents. He still took her 
swimming every day, although 
the Bullanese had gradually 
lost interest in Roxie and the 
manna deliveries had prac- 
tically stopped. 

Lyn was studying the Bull- 
anese language, which was 
neither extensive nor compli- 
cated, and at the same time 
learning everything else he 
could find that might be of use 
to him. 

The Bullanese didn’t have 
much sense of time. It was 



clear enough to Lyn now that 
he would never get them 
trained to bring in manna 
every two months or every 
six. There was no way of 
making them produce it. The 
code under which PDC was 
licensed to operate was strict- 
ly enforced by Hobley, and it 
was a fair enough code. No 
interference with the local 
people, no threats, no display 
of force. 

All the Bullanese wanted 
from the Terrans was a sup- 
ply of small, portable articles 
to make life easier for them 
— ^knives, needles, scissors, 
matches, electric torches, 
nails, screws, screwdrivers, 
compasses, pins, hand mir- 
rors, razors and the like. They 
had quite enough sales resist- 
ance to refuse anything they 
didn’t really need — ^politely, 
for they were a polite people. 

Consequently, the only bar- 
gaining point PDC had was 
the not very strong desire of 
the Bullanese for certain items 
which they could get any time 
they cared to bring in a little 
manna. PDC had made stren- 
uous efforts to sell them other 
things, including buildings, 
tractors and weather control, 
but the Bullanese simply 
didn’t want any of these 
things. 

There seemed to be no way 
to make them bring in manna 
in April rather than in June. 
Refusing to take it at the 
wrong time did more harm 
than good. They didn’t care — 

27 



ABSOLUTE POWER 




and having got the idea that 
the strangers no longer want- 
ed manna, and passed it 
around by the efficient bosh 
telegraph of primitive peop- 
les, they ceased bothering to 
bring it at all. It was far bet- 
ter from PDC’s point of view 
to take it at any time than to 
allow the Bullanese to think 
they were no longer inter- 
ested. 

It was still anybody's guess 
why the Maniacs had been so 
interested in Roxie at first, 
why their interest had waned, 
whether it could be kindled 
again and how to go about it. 

“Not much is known about 
the Bullanese, really,” Dr. 
Roza, the psychologist, told 
Lyn. “They’re harmless, cour- 
teous, but not very interested 
in us. They don’t regard us 
as gods and never did. We can 
fly in the sky, but they don’t 
want to fly. Only an ambitious 
race would admire our human 
civilization and they’re not 
ambitious.” 

“I never thought of that,” 
Lyn admitted. “We think 
some of the things we do are 
pretty wonderful. But you’re 
quite right — only a race that 
wanted to do the same things 
would be impressed by them.” 

“They wouldn’t care if we 
all disappeared one night,” 
Roza said. “In the old days, 
we’d have made them slaves 
and forced them to respect us, 
or pretend to. Under the pres- 
ent regulations, we more or 
less invite them to ignore us.” 

28 



“What about religion? Do 
you know about that?” Lyn 
asked. 

Roza shook his head. “There 
are ceremonies of some kind 
— at irregular intervals, for 
they don’t even have a calen- 
dar and, as you know, there 
are no seasons on Bullance. 
I’ve asked to attend them but 
I was put off — ^politely, of 
course. I don’t think they can 
amount to much, because 
there’s no particular excite- 
ment before or after.” 

Nevertheless, Lyn was very 
interested in this. He believed 
that the Bullanese had at first 
regarded Roxie as some kind 
of goddess and that their in- 
terest had dwindled only when 
she failed to do whatever 
their idea of a goddess should 
do. 

Anyway, it was a line to 
try. And there wasn’t much 
doubt that if he could re-es- 
tablish Roxie as a goddess, the 
manna would start rolling in 
again. Which would be a good 
thing, for the next ship, the 
Henry James, was due in 
about seven weeks. 

IX 

R oxie hmnmed to herself 
as she hurried through 
the corridors to Lyn’s office. 
When she noticed what she 
was doing she stopped at once, 
telling herself sharply that 
you couldn’t make yourself 
happy just by himuning a 
tune. 



J. T. MclNTOSH 




About to enter the office, 
she paused to tuck her blouse 
down into the waistband of 
her skirt and pat her hair. 

And she heard Lyn say : “I 
still think we can make them 
interested in Roxie again. 
After all, you say there’s 
never been anything like it 
before — nearly 200 tons in a 
week.” 

Gunther’s voice said : “They 
don’t come and look at her 
any more?” 

“For the last week we’ve 
hardly seen the natives at all. 
And when we do run into one 
of them, he looks at Roxie 
pretty much as he’d look at 
you or me.” 

“When they did come, was 
it only males, or females too ?” 

“That’s the funny thing — 
nearly as many females as 
males. They didn’t seem to 
want to touch her, only to be 
near her, to look at her. I used 
to get her to sunbathe close to 
the bushes, so that lots of 
them could — ” 

Roxie flung the door open 
and faced him, eyes blazing. 
“So all you cared about was 
manna !” 

“Come on in, Roxie. I’ll be 
with you right away.” 

“Those times we went 
swimming and sunbathing, 
jmu were putting on a show 
for the bugs. I didn’t matter 
at all — all you cared about 
was how much manna the 
God-damned Maniacs brought. 
When I thought you were in- 
terested in me, what you were 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



really interested in was a hun- 
dred thousand dollars!” 

Lyn smiled. “How about 
coming swimming with me, 
Roxie?” 

“No,” she screamed, “and I 
never will again !” 

Her high heels struck like 
machine-gun bullets as she 
ran down the corridor. 

“I’d better go after her,” 
Lyn said to Gunther. “Excuse 
me.” 

She wasn’t in her room. She 
wasn’t in the station. She 
wasn’t at any of the pools in 
which she and Lyn had swum. 
He gave up the search, know- 
ing she’d have to come in 
sometime. 

He didn’t curse fate, or him- 
self, or Roxie. Earlier, he had- 
n’t dared tell her that part of 
his reason for spending all 
those hours swimming and 
sunbathing with her had been 
the effect it seemed to have on 
manna supplies. By this time, 
he wouldn’t have thought she 
would fly off the handle like 
that. But then, part of her 
trouble was her gloomy cer- 
tainty that at any moment 
something would spoil every- 
thing and throw her back into 
the pit. 

She had been sure she would 
find something like this some- 
time. Being sure, she had 
found it. 

S HE ran through the bush 
until she was exhausted 
by the heat. Her thoughts 
weren’t coherent; there was 

29 




nothing but a dull misery in 
her heart. Her anger was 
gone. 

She didn’t particularly want 
to swim, but she was beside a 
lake and she was hot. She had 
no towel or bathing suit. Care- 
lessly she threw down her 
skirt and her blouse, stripped 
and waded into the water. 

When she had swum across 
the lake she began to feel bet- 
ter. Perhaps there might be 
excuses for Lyn, she thought. 
She would never trust him the 
way she had. She would al- 
ways be on her guard. All the 
same, now that he had shown 
himself to be no better and no 
worse than most of the men 
she had known in the past, 
there was no reason why she 
shouldn’t ... 

Still swimming, she found 
herself crying. That hadn’t 
happened for years. She had 
thought she had shed her last 
tears, that there were none 
left. 

Slowly she began to wade 
from the lake. Her temper 
flared again when she saw a 
Bullanese squatting by her 
clothes, watching her. 

She sank under the water 
again. “Go away!’’ she shout- 
ed. He didn’t move. She swore 
at him, using all the foul 
words she hadn’t used for 
nearly two weeks now. 

Her rage mounted. Reason 
told her that since the crea- 
ture on the bank was of a dif- 
ferent species from herself, it 
didn’t matter being naked be- 

30 



fore him any more than be- 
fore a dog or a cat. But she 
wasn’t listening to reason. 
She wanted to climb out of the 
water and get dressed. 

Suddenly her anger boiled 
over. “I’ll teach you,” she mut- 
tered, and waded out of the 
water. The Bullanese contin- 
ued to stare at her, not mov- 
ing. 

She hit him in the middle 
and he folded. She hit him 
several times with small, hard 
fists. He seemed to have no 
idea of self-defense, and each 
time a blow landed he jerked 
convulsively. 

When he fell on the ground, 
twitching, Roxie turned her 
back on him, dressed and left 
him where he lay. 

At the entrance to the sta- 
tion she met Lyn. “You’ve got 
trouble,” she said grimly. 
“I’ve just beaten up one of 
your Maniacs.” 

She pushed past him into 
the building. 

Hobley arrested her five 
minutes later. 

X 

T he Bullanese wasn’t dead, 
but he whsn’t far from it. 
Two of the porters carried 
him to the nearest village, 
Morat, on a stretcher. The 
Bullanese in the village took 
charge of him without making 
a fuss about it; perhaps they 
assumed there had been an ac- 
cident, and the injured Ma- 
niac, being unconscious, was 

j. T. McIntosh 




in no position to give his 
story. 

At the PDC base, HoWey 
convened a court. Lyn didn’t 
say a word. Although he was 
Premier of Bullance, immedi- 
ately a crime was committed, 
all of Lyn’s power passed to 
Hobley. 

The charge was attempted 
murder. 

The trial was brief and 
businesslike. Roxie was sen- 
tenced to detention within the 
base until the next ship ar- 
rived, and then deportation. 

“And you’re very lucky,- 
Miss Dainton,” Hobley told 
her, “that we don’t have power 
to do more than deport you. 
Natives on PDC worlds have 
the same rights as humans. 
You should get ten years for 
this.” 

Roxie said nothing. She had 
been white, frightened, inco- 
herent, very much alone ever 
since she had been arrested. 
The court proceedings seemed 
like a bad dream. 

It was Gunther who 
brought the steel band and fit- 
ted it on her wrist. “You know 
what this is. Miss Dainton? 
You can go anywhere you like 
within the station, but if you 
attempt to leave it, a needle 
will prick your arm and you’ll 
black out. You understand?” 

She nodded. This couldn’t 
be happening either. 

Then everybody was filing 
out and she was left alone in 
the projection room which 
had been used for the court. " 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



She sat down and let her 
forehead rest on the table in 
front of her. 

Only a couple of hours ago 
she had been happy. She had 
believed in Lyn Barr as she 
had never believed in any man 
before, almost loved him, cer- 
tainly respected him as she 
had never thought she’d re- 
spect any human being again. 

Then her idealistic picture 
of him had been shattered, 
and in her angry misery she 
had attacked a native and . 

She still was a little hazy 
about that. Even after the sol- 
emn words and grim faces of 
the court, it still seemed to 
her that all she’d done was 
what anybody would have 
done in the heat of the mo- 
ment — anybody but Lyn, of 
course. 

There she went again, 
thinking Lyn was something 
special. In fact, he had shown 
himself to be just like . 

“Roxie,” said Lyn. 

She sat up. Suddenly she 
was crying, and in his arms 
for the first time. 

“If only you hadn’t run out 
like that,” Lyn said when she 
had dried her eyes. “Roxie, 
you gave yourself a lot of 
heartache for nothing. You 
know that now, don’t you?” 

“No, I don’t know it now.” 
She tried to be sharp and bit- 
ter and unforgiving, but it’s 
hard to cut a man down to 
size when you’ve just been 
convicted of a crime. 

“Well, I’m telling you, then. 

31 




What did you hear? That it 
was the Maniacs’ interest in 
you that made them bring 
manna to the station. That 
ought to give you a kick, in- 
stead of making you furious.” 
“You know it wasn’t that. 
It was learning that all you 
cared about was — ” 

“Roxie, that first day we 
went out I didn’t know the 
natives were going to bring 
manna because of you. Yes- 
terday and today I knew they 
weren’t, because they stopped 
days ago. Did I say to you, 
‘Roxie, the natives don’t care 
about you any more, so I’m 
sure you’ll understand if I 
haven’t any time for you now 
— good-by — thanks for your 
help’?” 

“No, but that first week you 
were thinking about the man- 
na, not about me.” 

Lyn grinned. “If you think 
I can lie beside you and think 
about manna, with you in that 
white swimsuit of yours, you 
must have a very curious idea 
of the things men think 
about.” 

Her eyes were hardly dry, 
but she was laughing. And 
she was sorry about She na- 
tive now, for he’d been beaten 
up for nothing. 

L yn went to the village 
rather warily, uncertain 
of his reception. But the Bull- 
anese seemed indifferent to 
the fact that one of their num- 
ber had been half killed. 

Zin was the one he usually 



talked to; “Is the injured man 
all right?” Lyn asked. 

Zin held out his hands in 
the Bullanese equivalent of 
the Gallic shrug. 

“Did he speak?” 

“Yes. Zar said the White 
Lady por. But some of us 
went to see and she did not 
por.” 

“What is ‘por’?” 

Zin held out his hands 
again. Por was por. 

Questioning a Bullanese 
was rather like discussing 
Kant’s Critique of Pure Rea- 
son with a somewhat back- 
ward child, but Lyn had noth- 
ing to lose. 

“Why did you like the 
White Lady?” 

“Because she por.” 

Lyn tried to work that out. 
Zar, the Bullanese whom 
Roxie had injured, had said 
she por ; the Bullanese used to 
like her because she por. 

“She doesn’t por now?” he 
asked. 

“No. Some of us went to 
see, and she does not por.” 

Zar, who had said Roxie 
por, had seen her wade nude 
from a lake. Formerly, when 
apparently she por, she had 
sunbathed beside a pool. But 
that wasn’t it; until yesterday 
she’d continued swimming 
and sunbathing, yet it seemed 
she didn’t por any more. 

“The White Lady is beauti- 
ful,” Lyn said tentatively. 

“Yes.” 

Quick agreement, but that 
wasn’t it either. She was still 



32 



j. T. McIntosh 




beautiful and she didn’t por 
any more. 

Yet there was a possibility 
there. That the Bullanese, al- 
though they belonged to a dif- 
ferent race, had found Roxie 
attractive was beyond doubt. 
Zin himself, that first day, 
had found her interesting in 
coveralls, but more so when 
she took them off. Yet one 
could grow tired of even a 
beautiful girl in a swimsuit, 
especially if she was of an 
alien race. But suppose, after 
one had grown tired of her in 
a swimsuit, she took it off? 

Well, that would explain 
how Roxie could cease to por 
except to Zar that morning. 
And if that explanation was 
correct, Roxie might be a 
source of more manna yet, if 
she could be persuaded . 

Back at the station. Bend- 
ers, the language expert, was- 
n’t much help about “por.” 
“I’ve come across it once or 
twice,” he said, “without be- 
ing able to establish its mean- 
ing. It’s connected with re- 
ligion somehow.” 

“That I guessed,” Lyn said. 
“The tentative conclusion I 
reached was too damned sim- 
ple. You’re sui'e it’s nothing 
to do with beauty — attraction 
— even sex as well?” 

Benders shook his head. 
“I’m not sure. Get an invita- 
tion to one of the Bullanese 
religious ceremonies and you 
might find out. If you do, let 
me know.” 

Lyn knew Benders was be- 

absolOte power 



ing mildly sarcastic, but the 
suggestion gave him an idea. 
“I will,” he said thoughtfully. 
“I will.” 

XI 

B efore mentioning his 
plans to Roxie, Lyn went 
to Hobley to plead with him. 

“I’m sorry. Premier,” Hob- 
ley said firmly. “I haven’t got 
the power to interfere with 
the sentence. And whether the 
Bullanese are concerned about 
the crime or not is neither 
here nor there. Miss Dainton 
was found guilty and sentence 
was passed. I really can’t do 
anything.” 

“Hobley,” said Lyn, “I 
know you’re autonomous and 
I’m not trying to bribe or in- 
timidate you. But if the base 
here is abandoned and Bull- 
ance is closed to commerce, 
and if I report that this hap- 
pened because Mr. Hobley 
wouldn’t cooperate with me, 
do you think you’ll be popular 
with your own superiors?” 
Hobley, who was a fat man, 
began to sweat. “If that isn’t 
intimidation, I don’t know 
what is.” 

“Mr. Hobley, you’re a man 
of intelligence. Now, as you 
no doubt know, the fact that 
the Meredith left with a full 
load of manna was due entire- 
ly to the interest of the Bull- 
anese in Roxie Dainton. If I 
am to achieve anything be- 
fore the Henry James arrives, 
I need Roxie Dainton — and I 
need her outside the station.” 

33 




Hobley foun^ a face-saver. 
“Well, of course, if you’ll be 
with her all the time and are 
prepared to take full responsi- 
bility , . he said. “After all, 
I don’t want to be uncoopera- 
tive, Premier.’’ 

Roxie was a tougher nut to 
crack. She didn’t get furious 
and tell him she’d see him in 
hell first. She merely frowned 
slightly and said : “Lyn, I 
wish I knew how to take you. 
Sometimes I think I could 
trust you with anything. And 
other times it seems you’d sell 
me and your own soul and 
anything else you could think 
of, just to have another man- 
na load waiting for Henry 
James" 

“If you did trust me,’’ said 
Lyn cheerfully, “things would 
be easier for both of us.’’ 

She shook her head som- 
berly. “It isn’t as easy as that 
to start trusting people.’’ 

“I’m telling you honestly, 
Roxie, I’m trying to fix up 
Bullance for your father, and 
for the hundred grand I’m 
going to get for doing it, and 
at the same time I’m getting 
to like a girl and she’s getting 
to like me. I haven’t made a 
pass at you yet, have I?’’ 
“No,” she said. “You have- 
n’t.” 

“If and when I do. I’ll mean 
it. Doesn’t the fact that I 
haven’t, so far, show that you 
can trust me?” 

“I don’t know what it 
shows. I don’t know where 
I’m at, and you’re trying to do 

34 



so many things at once, I 
don’t know what you really 
want either.” 

“If you want to stay cooped 
up here until the Henry James 
arrives, you can. If you don’t, 
come swimming with me the 
way we used to.” 

“Except that I have to swim 
in the raw and you call all the 
Maniacs from far and wide to 
come and look at me.” 

Lyn grinned. “To tell the 
honest truth,” he said, “all 
this is an elaborate plot to get 
you to swim with me.” 

“I’m not too happy about 
that either.” 

“No, but that’s all right. I 
am— and you trust me, don’t 
you, Roxie?” 

T he Bullanese came, scores 
of them. They kept out of 
the way as much as possible, 
as before. 

After some hesitation, 
Roxie, who had been relieved 
of the bracelet meant to keep 
her a prisoner in the base, 
threw off her clothes. Lyn 
kept his bathing trunks on. 

They swam and returned to 
the bank. Roxie had promised 
to sunbathe and to try to for- 
get the Bullanese ogling her 
from behind every bush. 

But she didn’t have to try. 
Before they reached the bank, 
the Bullanese were gone, 
every last one of them. 

“Well, it didn’t work,” she 
said, throwing her wet hair 
back out of her eyes. 

“I told you,” said Lyn, “it 

J. T. MclNTOSH 




was all an elaborate plot to get 
you to swim in the raw.” 
“Lyn, you really don’t mind 
that it didn’t work? That the 
Bullanese don’t care about me 
any more?” 

“Roxie, even if you made 
the Bullanese sick. I’d still 
like you the way you are.” 

She reached for her clothes. 
“This was science, remem- 
ber?” 

“Yes,” he said. “You’d bet- 
ter get dressed. Because I’m 
still not going to make a pass 
«t you, and it’s heroic work 
not to.” 

“SHE DID not por,” said Zin. 
He wasn’t angry — Bullanese 
were never angry. He didn’t 
blame Lyn — Bullanese never 
blamed anybody. 

“Zin, what do you have to 
do to por?” asked Lyn Barr. 
“I cannot por.” 

“No, but the White Lady — 
what was she doing when she 
did por?” 

“Nothing.” 

Lyn searched in his mind 
for a formula which might 
get the right answer. It was- 
n’t ignorance of the language 
which stumped him; it was 
the language itself. So there 
wasn’t much hope of finding 
other words to explain por. 
Then Lyn had an idea. 
"Sometimes you have cere- 
monies,” he said. 

“Yes.” 

“Suppose the White Lady 
attended one of these cere- 
monies?” 



Zin started to make a po- 
lite, roundabout refusal. 

But when he was allowed to 
speak, Lyn said: “If she was 
present at such a ceremony, 
she might por.” 

Zin was silent for a long 
time. At last he said: “Next 
time, I will send for you and 
you will bring the White 
Lady.” 

XII 

T he Henry James arrived 
three weeks early. All the 
manna there was at the base 
was twenty tons which the 
Meredith hadn’t been able to 
take. 

Although Lyn had the right 
to hold the Henry James at 
least three weeks, and more if 
necessary, he wished she had- 
n’t been early. Something 
might have happened in the 
next three weeks — a Bull- 
anese religious ceremony, for 
instance. 

The arrival of the ship, 
however, did give him an op- 
portunity to make another 
experiment. He borrowed the 
prettiest girls on the Henry 
James, had them immunized 
against Bullanese bacteria, 
and took them swimming with 
Roxie. 

It was another flop. Quite a 
few Bullanese came to watch, 
wildly curious. But apparent- 
ly not one of the girls could 
por. 

No manna was delivered. 
Roxie had been silent and 
withdrawn while the girls 

35 



ABSOLUTE POWER 




were around, and especially as 
Lyn had laughed and had fun 
with them. 

Later, when the girls were 
back on the Henry James, she 
said : “That little redhead cer- 
tainly has a nice figure.” 
“Yes, but you don’t need to 
be jealous,” Lyn said. “Her 
father isn’t a millionaire.” 
Roxie turned to him quick- 
ly. “Lyn, I know what it’s like 
now. When I used to compete 
with another girl for a man — 
any girl, any man — I always 
won because I didn’t give a 
damn about either of them. 
It’s easy when you don’t 
care.” 

Lyn didn’t say anything. 
“Don’t get me wrong,” she 
said. “I know I’m different 
now, happier, less unsure. 
And you’ve done it, Lyn.” 

He shook his head “I didn’t 
do anything. If somebody 
who’s all mixed up starts un- 
twisting himself, others can 
help, but they can’t do the job. 
I told you once I’d like you if 
you became likable, Roxie. 
Well, I like you now. I like 
you a lot.” 

A COUPLE of weeks passed 
and then the summons 
came. There were no regular 
dates for ceremonies any more 
than the Bullanese had regu- 
lar dates for anything. Ap- 
parently what happened was 
simply that everyone felt it 
was time for a ceremony. 

“And you’re lucky you only 
had to wait a couple of 

36 



weeks,” Roza told Lyn. “We 
don’t know every time they 
hold a ceremony, naturally. 
But there’s sometimes more 
than six months between 
them.” He sighed. “I wish I 
were coming with you.” 

“Sorry,” Lyn said. “The in- 
vitation is purely for Roxie, 
in the hope that she’ll por 
again. And it’s assumed I’ll 
go along because they’ve hard- 
ly ever seen Roxie without 
me.” 

“Well, don’t miss any- 
thing,” Roza said. 

Roxie wasn’t keen on the 
affair. She had never really 
taken to the Bullanese; de- 
spite their alien grace they 
repelled her, and probably 
when she had beaten up Zar 
part of the reason had been 
a fear of him, an unthinking 
urge to destroy him. 

However, by this time it 
seemed so natural to do as 
Lyn told her that she never 
seriously considered refusing 
to go, although she did say: 
“Lyn, does this manna busi- 
ness really matter to you? 
Suppose the Maniacs never 
did bring any more and you 
had to go back and say you’d 
failed?” ■ 

“I wouldn’t like to do that,” 
he said. “But I don’t suppose 
it would break me. After all, 
your father knows that the 
chances of success aren’t high. 
And I guess he’s pretty pleas- 
ed to get one full shipload — 
something that never happen- 
ed before.” 



J. T. MclNTOSH 




“Suppose you do fail — 
will you be sorry you tried? 
Will you be sorry you ever 
came to Bullance?” 

He grinned. “I know what 
you want me to say, but Tm 
not going to say it. Not now.” 

He didn’t mention any pos- 
sibility of danger to Roxie, 
apart from warning her, 
whatever happened, not to 
show surprise or lose her 
head. However, he knew that 
even a polite, peaceful race 
like the Bullanese, who had 
never harmed a human being, 
might suddenly become very 
different during the fervor of 
a religious ceremony. In his 
pockets he had two guns 
which between them could fire 
several hundred bullets sin- 
gly or very rapidly. And he 
had arranged for Hobley and 
Gunther to be listening not 
too far from the village, ready 
to come running if any shote 
were fired. 

As for Roxie, he merely had 
her dress in a shimmering 
white gown with spangled 
tights underneath it, just in 
case she should be called on to 
take part in the ceremony or 
preside over it, or anything of 
the sort. Although lately it 
had seemed that whatever por 
was, it had nothing to do with 
Roxie’s physical charms, he 
still wasn’t entirely con- 
vinced. 

As night fell they went to 
Morat and Zin motioned them 
to sit in the shadows of an 
open hut. The village looked 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



the same as usual and the only 
preparation which had been 
made was that , two posts had 
been driven into the ground 
about eight feet apart. 

“What is going to happen, 
Zin?” Lyn asked. 

Zin disappeared into the 
shadows, pretending not to 
have heard. 

There was no elaborate 
ceremonial at the beginning, 
at any rate. Gradually the 
clearing in the center of the 
village filled. There was little 
or no talking, for the Bull- 
anese were not a talkative 
race. They stood about in 
their ordinary clothes as if 
waiting for a deus ex machina 
to arrive and start the pro- 
ceedings. 

T hough Lyn and Roxie 
were in deep shadow, 
the Bullanese knew they 
were there, and periodically 
shot curious glances at them. 
There was nothing resem- 
bling the eager interest which 
had once been shown in Roxie. 

Presently a wooden box was 
brought out and all the Bull- 
anese, male and female, 
crowded around it. Some sort 
of draw seemed to be going 
on. When it was over, five of 
them stood to one side — two 
women and three men. 

Still there seemed to be no 
excitement, no feeling of an- 
ticipation. Someone pointed 
with a kind of wand and one 
of the five lay down. 

Before Lyn and Roxie sus- 

37 




pected what was going to hap- 
pen, the Bullanese with the 
wand had driven its sharp 
point into the bulbous pelvis 
of the man on the ground. 
The stick went straight 
through and pinned the 
creature to the soft ground be- 
neath him. He moaned, writh- 
ing and twitching like an 
insect on a pin, clearly in mor- 
tal agony. 

Roxie made a muffled ex- 
clamation of horror. Lyn 
grabbed her arm and pressed 
it. At such a time, it might be 
dangerous to draw attention 
to themselves. 

Now there was excitement 
and pleasure. The Bullanese 
filed past the dying Maniac, 
looking down on his agony in 
simple delight. 

A few minutes later the sec- 
ond of the five victims was 
similarly skewered and his 
moans mingled with those of 
the other. Then one of the 
women was pinned to the 
ground, and the other man. 
The four of them screamed 
and groaned in torture, their 
gray limbs thrashing about. 
They formed a square about 
the two posts. 

Roxie closed her eyes, but 
almost immediately opened 
them again. Some of the Bull- 
anese held flares now, and it 
was impossible not to watch 
the scene in the center of the 
dark clearing. 

There was a sort of pattern 
in the wanderings of the Bull- 
anese, through the square of 

38 



victims, out at the other side 
and back. Although there was 
no singing and dancing, every- 
body was happy — except the 
four dying creatures with 
sharp wands through them. 

The remaining victim, a 
young female, stood aside. She 
was not bound. Only at the 
last moment, when they came 
for her, did terror take over 
and she tried to flee. 

They caught her and 
brought her to the center of 
the square. Her ankles were 
tied to one post about five feet 
from the ground. Her wrists 
were bound to the other, and 
she lay in mid-air, stretched 
taut. About her the four other 
victims still moaned and 
writhed. 

There was a shout and at 
the signal the girl tied to the 
posts was surrounded. For a 
moment Lyn and Roxie could- 
n’t see what was happening. 
Then Roxie put her hands 
over her eyes, and Lyn turn- 
ed his head away, sickened. 

He would have taken Roxie 
away right then if he could, 
but it was several hours be- 
fore they could go. By that 
time the four skewered Mani- 
acs were dead. They hadn’t 
been eaten. Apparently it 
wasn’t worth eating anybody 
unless he was alive. The body 
of the girl, what remained of 
it, still hung from the posts. 

One by one the Bullanese 
had left the square and gone 
into their own cottages. At 
last, when the square was 

j. T. McIntosh 




empty except for the bodies 
of the five victims, Lyn pulled 
Roxie to her feet and they 
began to run back to the base. 
She was crying helplessly. 

XIII 

I N THE large, bright room 
at the top of the PDC 
Building, Lyn said; “I took 
the whole colony off Bullance, 
with all the most valuable 
equipment. We’re not allowed 
to interfere.” 

Dainton shuddered. “Roxie 
saw this?” 

“She’s getting over it. She 
used to think she was cruel. 
Now she knows she’s not.” 

“I still don’t get it. What 
was por? Why were the Bull- 
anese fascinated by Roxie at 
first?” 

“Nobody guessed that such 
a primitive race had a kind of 
telepathy,” Lyn said. “Empa- 
thy, rather. They draw 
strength from misery and 
grief and pain and bitterness. 
When Roxie arrived on Bull- 
ance, she was quite a treat for 
them. She was por. By just 
being near her, they could get 
a real jag — ^no need to torture 
one of themselves to death. 

“But Roxie stopped being 
so bitter and miserable. She 
began to be almost happy. No 
thanks to the Maniacs — they 
don’t draw grief out; they 
just stand around and get 
drunk on it. Anyway, Roxie 
wasn’t so bitter any more. She 
wasn’t in mental agony — ex- 

ABSOLUTE POWER 



cept that day when she beat 
up Zar, and as he truth- 
fully told the others, she por 
again. Only by the time the 
other Bullanese got close 
enough to her to sense it, she 
didn’t por any more.” 

“I see,” said Edgar Dainton 
thoughtfully. 

“PDC employees are well 
balanced, stable. Roxie was 
the first and only human of 
her type the Maniacs ever en- 
countered. Now if you really 
want manna and aren’t too 
concerned about your meth- 
ods, you can hire a lot of mis- 
erable people and send them 
out to Bullance. You’ll get a 
lot of manna.” 

“I don’t think I will, some- 
how . Hey, sit down ! We’ve 
hardly started to talk!” 

“I’ve finished,” said Lsm 
pleasantly, “and I’ve got a 
date with your daughter. For 
a change, we’re going swim- 
ming.” 

Dainton didn’t smile, but 
his eyes were warm and a lit- 
tle moist. “You are, are you?” 
“I’m going to make a pass 
at Roxie. Do you mind?” 
“Mean you never have?” 
“Not like this one. I had to 
see you first and make sure 
her father’s prospects were 
good enough to marry her.” 
“Take care of her,” Dainton 
said huskily. 

“That’s one thing I’m good 
at,” Lyn said. “All Roxie ever 
needed was love. I’m going to 
see she gets it — from you and 
me both.” i n o

ASSASSIN 



By BASCOM JONES, JR. 



Everyone is allowed to 
commit an error. The trouble 
was that I couldn’t. 



1 DELIBERATELY dug my 
heels into the concrete floor 
of the corridor of the Penta- 
gon, The steel plates on the 
heels of my black uniform 
boots heralded my approach 
with sharp anvil sounds as I 
marched confidently toward 
the unmarked door five hun- 
dred feet ahead. 

What was that expression 
used by Earth people of the 
20th century? I shifted back 
through my training, shuffled 
through the facts about 
Earth’s past history with 
which I had been indoctrinat- 
ed, searching for the word. 
Assassin! That was it. But 
the term fell short. It lacked 
in magnitude. There was a 
difference in the murder of 
one person and the assassina- 
tion of the occupants of an en- 
tire planet! 




One foot in front of the 
other, I paced off the distance 
toward the end of the hall- 
way, carefully duplicating 
the strut which was a trade- 
mark of the Earth Council’s 
Security Police. I’d practiced 
the peculiar, jolting method 
of walking a thousand times, 
but I began to feel the effects 
of Earth’s heavier gravity be- 
fore I had covered half the 
distance. It had been impos- 
sible to simulate the dif- 
ference in gravity in my 
training. 

The two guards standing 
outside the door alertly 
watched my approach. When 
I was still four paces away, 
one of them ordered me to 
stop. They ignored as though 
they were not there the gold 
stars prominently displayed 
on the shoulders of my tunic. 

The guard on the left said, 
“Your ID card, sir.” 

The guards were well train- 
ed. They would not hesitate to 
shoot if I made the slightest 
slip. 

I handed the card to him 
and watched as he held it up 
to a visi-scanner in the wall. 
The scanner glowed into life 
and purred softly, rapidly 
checking the invisible identi- 
fication codings on the card 
against the ID component of 
Earth’s Master Machine. Then 
it dulled and was silent The 
strident alarm siren over the 
scanner remained inactive. 
The ID card was returned to 
me and the guards snapped 

ASSASSIN 



smartly to attention as I went 
on into the room beyond the 
door. 

I had passed the first test. 

T he reception room was 
small. Thick carpeting 
deadened the clump of my 
heels as 1 marched toward the 
chromed desk guarding a sec- 
ond unmarked door. A flaw- 
lessly proportioned redhead 
sat behind the desk. Her eyes 
and face showed no expres- 
sion when I stopped in front 
of her. Her tight-fitting uni- 
form was black and bore the 
gold trim of the Security Po^ 
lice. 

Constricting my throat, I 
let the words snap out crisp- 
ly, as I had been trained. 

“General Spicer,” I said, 
“commanding general of the 
Security Police, reporting to 
the Secretary of Defense. As 
requested.” 

I waited. 

Her eyes, still showing no 
outward expression, ran over 
me rapidly. Then she thumb- 
ed a button on the desk and a 
screen, recessed into the 
chromed surface, glowed into 
life. 

Almost immediately, a full- 
face reproduction of the fea- 
tures of General Spicer 
appeared on the screen in 
color. She checked the image 
against my face, her eyes 
flickering to the tiny scar un- 
der my left eye and to the old 
blaster burn across my right 
ear. When the image changed 

41 




to a profile view, I turned my 
head to give her the same 
angle. 

She nodded, pressing the 
button on her desk which 
darkened the screen. 

She said, “You’re early. 
Your appointment with Secre- 
tary Bartlett is — ” 

“For 1300 hours,” I filled in 
automatically, when she hesi- 
tated in one last routine test. 
“I was in the building on an- 
other matter, however, and 
came here after I had finished 
my other business.” 

“Yes, of course,” she said. 
“Please take a seat. Senator 
Chambers is ahead of you, but 
his business will not take 
long.” 

I fought back the sudden 
impulse to pivot and stare in 
the direction her eyes were in- 
dicating. Senator Carl Cham- 
bers. My briefing on him had 
been lengthy. For 60 Earth 
years, he had headed the un- 
Earth Activities Committee. 
As General Spicer, I was sup- 
posed to have a nodding ac- 
quaintance with him, but no 
more than that. During the 
years, our rivalry had become 
legend. His unanticipated 
presence in the waiting room 
could prove disastrous. Cham- 
bers would not be fooled 
easily. 

Turning slowly, I nodded 
stiffly and curtly in Chambers’ 
direction and then selected a 
chair across the room from 
him. 

The senator’s head merged 

42 



directly into the shoulders of 
his grossly rotund body. 
Small, round eyes stared un- 
blinkingly at me from the j*ed 
pudginess of his face. They 
hesitated on the black swag- 
ger stick which I held loosely 
in my right hand, moved on, 
and then returned to it. The 
invisible scars, made by the 
electro-surgical knives in re- 
designing my body, began to 
tense slowly. I shifted the 
swagger stick in my hand. 

Then the redheaded secre- 
tary stood up. She said, 
“Secretary Bartlett will see 
you now, Senator.” 

F or a fraction of a time, 
I thought Senator Cham- 
bers had not heard her. His 
expressionless eyes were still 
on me. Then, with a grunt, he 
lifted himself to his feet and 
disappeared through the door 
behind her. A tiny clicking 
noise indicated that it locked 
automatically. 

I shifted my gaze and saw 
that the secretary was looking 
at me intently. It was impos- 
sible to guess at what might 
be going on behind those eyes. 
The tension began to build in- 
side me again, but I kept my 
own eyes as expressionless as 
hers. 

The girl picked up a folded 
piece of paper out of a recep- 
tacle on her desk and brought 
it over to me. 

She said, “While you’re 
waiting. General, you might 
like to read the latest fac- 

BASCOM JONES, JR. 




simile. Or have you already 
seen it?” 

I shook my head. “I saw the 
1100 fac-report, but I missed 
this one.” 

She handed it to me and re- 
turned to her desk. There was 
just the slightest suggestion 
of a rolling movement in her 
walk, not at all unpleasant. 

When I looked down at the 
facsimile sheet, the headline 
screamed silently up at me. I 
swiveled my eyes over at the 
secretary, but she was work- 
ing her recordo-writer, her 
fingers moving rapidly, me- 
chanically. 

The headline read : ALIEN 
INVADER DISCOVERED! 
The story that followed re- 
ported that two Security Po- 
lice guards had intercepted 
someone who looked like and 
was dressed like an Earth- 
man, trying to enter the 
Senate at 1109 hours that 
morning. A discrepancy had 
been discovered during the 
routine ID card check and the 
imposter had tried to escape. 
The guards had opened fire at 
close range, scoring two di- 
rect hits. 

While the account was ob- 
viously censored, it intimated 
that a full report to be re- 
leased later by Security Po- 
lice Headquarters would be 
almost unbelievable. It hinted 
that the hideous mess revealed 
when the guards’ weapons 
had ripped through the sur- 
prisingly soft body armor of 
the impostor positively con- 

ASSASSIN 



firmed the fact that the in- 
dividual was an enemy alien. 

Before I could read any 
further, there was a muted 
tone from the direction of the 
desk. The secretary acknowl- 
edged the signal, spoke sev- 
eral words whicn I couldn’t 
hear, then looked at me. 

She said, “You may go in 
now. General Spicer.” 

I placed the facsimile sheet 
on her desk and waited while 
she activated the circuit, 
which would release the catch 
on her side of the door. 

Who had it been? There had 
been four of us. Volunteers. 
We had been selected, briefed 
and trained separately. We 
had been housed separately 
during the mental and physi- 
cal tortures of the surgical 
and the psych labs. The ship 
which had brought us to 
Earth had released us at sepor- 
rate points above the Earth 
capital. Only our ultimate goal 
was the same. But now there 
was one less of us to accom- 
plish that goal! And we had 
lost the element of surprise. 

The door clicked twice and 
swung open. I stepped 
through, just in time to see 
the rotund shape of Senator 
Chambers go out a private 
exit on the far side of the 
room. Both doors closed at al- 
most the same moment and I 
stood alone before the Secre- 
tary of Defense for the planet 
Earth. 

The secretary sat behind a 
desk on the far side of the 

43 




room. He was a powerful 
man, in keeping with the im- 
portance of the job he filled. 
But the huge memory bank 
which he relied upon and 
which filled the entire wall 
behind his desk seemed to 
dwarf him. 

Without looking up imme- 
diately, Secretary Bartlett 
carefully rewound a tape he 
had been referring to and fed 
it back into the open mouth of 
the memory unit. 

H e said, “Spicer, we’ve 
been talking about you. 
Do you have anything new on 
this alien incident? Chambers 
said an impulse cleared the 
Master Machine last night, in- 
dicating there may have been 
some sort of ship overhead.” 
“No. sir,” I lied. “My peo- 
ple are working on it, but we 
don’t have much more to go 
on than appeared in the latest 
fac-report.” 

“If there was a ship over- 
head, it was protected by a 
new type of anti-identification 
device. The Master Machine 
probed for more than six min- 
utes and registered only a 
void. Chambers, of course, is 
always — ” 

Bartlett didn’t finish the 
sentence. His words trailed 
off into a moment of puzzled 
silence as he turned and look- 
ed squarely at me for the first 
time. 

Something had gone wrong. 
Something that I had done or 
hadn’t done had revealed to 



him that I wasn’t General 
Spicer. 

Secretary Bartlett started 
to rise. “Why, you’re not Spic- 
er! You’re an impostor!” 

His eyes displayed neither 
fear nor surprise, but his 
hand was less than a time 
point from the alarm buzzer 
on the top of his desk when I 
touched the tiny stud on the 
hilt of my useless-looking 
swagger stick. 

For the tick of a pulse, he 
sat there with his body bathed 
in the colored ray, his finger 
poised above the warning 
buzzer. Then his body began 
to glow. 1 closed my eyes 
when the heat and brightness 
reached my face. When I 
opened them, there was noth- 
ing left of Bartlett but a swirl 
of dust motes. 

Stepping behind the desk, I 
stripped off the thin plasti- 
mask which had disguised my 
features to look like those of 
General Spicer. My hands 
moved almost automatically. 
Each motion had been re- 
hearsed, timed, analyzed, and 
timed again. 

I reversed my coat, hiding 
the gold markings of the Se- 
curity Police, and revealing 
the precious-metal insignia 
which had been worn by the 
Secretary of Defense. The 
now-useless ID card, which I 
had obtained earlier when I 
destroyed the real General 
Spicer, was dropped into the 
office incendiary tube, along 
with the mask and the remov-

able steel cappings of my 
boots. 

By the time I had finished, 
only the swagger stick re- 
mained to connect me with 
General Spicer. I carefully tel- 
escoped its length, twisting 
and turning the artfully de- 
signed tubing, until it was 
identical to Bartlett’s cane of 
state, leaning against the 
desk. The real cane I disposed 
of by dropping it into the in- 
cendiary tube after the other 
articles. 

I turned the stiff black col- 
lar of my coat up, in the same 
manner that Bartlett had 
worn his. The upturned collar 
hid the tiny metal electrodes 
protruding from the base of 
my neck, under each ear. 

W HEN I sat down behind 
the desk, the image re- 
flected up at me from the 
chromed top was, feature for 
feature, that of Defense Sec- 
retary Bartlett. The electro- 
surgical knives, wielded by 
experts, had done a good job. 
I grimaced. I puffed out my 
cheeks. I rolled my eyes. And, 
in turn, the reflected image 
grimaced, puffed out its 
cheeks, and rolled its eyes. 
The texture of my skin was 
that of Bartlett’s. Even the 
pore sti’ucture. 

This had been the final big 
hurdle. The rest was now up 
to me. 

No! More accurately, the 
rest depended upon routine — 
a routine established more 



than 70 Earth years ago — a 
routine so inflexible that it 
had not been broken for a sin- 
gle day. My mission was to 
break that routine. 

Destruction of Spicer and 
Bartlett was important only 
as a means to an end. As soon 
as they were missed, others 
would fill their places. I had 
to destroy all Spicers and all 
Bartletts. I had to destroy the 
residents of Washington, of 
London, of New York, of 
Earth! 

My mission was to destroy 
so that we could live. That 
was what the technicians in 
the psych-labs had told me. 
That was what the physicians 
behind the electro-surgical 
knives had told me. It had 
been drummed into me over 
and over, through every phase 
of the mental and physical 
preparation that I had been 
put through. 

So I sat in Bartlett’s office, 
looking like Bartlett, waiting. 
I knew almost to the exact 
time point when the buzzer on 
the desk in front of me would 
sound. I expected it, but when 
the strident tone filled the 
room, I jumped. 

I thumbed the switch on the 
desk video-corn and the fea- 
tures of the redheaded secre- 
tary looked out at me from the 
recessed screen. I deepened 
my voice to mimic Bartlett’s. 

“Yes, Meta?” 

The video-corn was a two- 
way security system and I 
knew that she could see me. 



ASSASSIN 



45 




too. She continued to stare, 
and I felt the scar tissue tight- 
en around the electrodes in 
my neck. 

Through some flaw in 
transmission, for a brief mo- 
ment, I thought I saw the 
twinkle of an expression deep 
in her eyes. But that was im- 
possible. Her lips twitched 
and the transmission flaw, or 
whatever it might have been, 
was corrected. Her eyes were 
as inscrutable as ever. 

She said, “It’s 1324, sir. 
The inspection group will be 
here in two minutes. Shall 1 
bring them in?” 

I nodded my head to one side 
slightly, in a manner peculiar 
to Bartlett. “Thank you, Meta, 
Yes, of course. Bring them in 
as soon as they arrive.” 

I switched the video-corn 
off and let my Angers lightly 
play with the button on the 
desk that activated the lock 
on Bartlett’s private door into 
the inner corridor. It was a 
temptation to open the door 
and attempt to go the rest of 
the way on my own. But I 
wouldn’t make it. Not even 
disguised as Defense Secre- 
tary Bartlett. I had been 
warned not to try. 

M y only hope lay in the 
I'outine set up by Earth’s 
scientists more than 70 years 
ago — the daily inspection of 
the unit. As a member of the 
inspection party, I could pass 
through the security guards. 
More important, as a member 

46 



of the group, I would arrive 
at the protective force sphere 
at the hub of the Pentagon at 
the only time and at the only 
place the force sphere could 
be breached, 

I waited. 

Precisely at the end of 
Meta’s two minutes, the lock 
buzzed on the door to the re- 
ception room. I touched the 
control which opened the door 
and stood as the group filed 
into the room. My briefings on 
each of them had been ex- 
haustive, but I examined their 
faces for some sign that one 
or more might penetrate my 
disguise as Bartlett. 

'The redheaded Meta nod- 
ded. She had been with Bart- 
lett as his security secretary 
for 70 years. Senator Cham- 
bers, as a representative of 
the electorate, darted rapid 
glances around the room as 
soon as the door had closed, 
counting noses. General Whit 
Marshall, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff of the 
police systems, nodded with 
the cold reserve of the high- 
ranking military to the high- 
er-ranking civilian. The 
fourth member of the group, 
Chet Meyers, chief Master 
Machine technician, was the 
only one to speak. 

'The lanky Meyers looked 
around the room. “Where’s 
General Spicer, sir? Senator 
Chambers was telling us you 
were going to invite him be- 
cause of this scare today,” 

The invisible scars which 

BASCOM JONES, JR. 




cobwebbed across my body 
from the electro-surgical 
knives tensed so suddenly that 
I almost screamed. I made my- 
self reach for my cane casu- 
ally. I had come so close ! 

No, wait — there was the 
bitter rivalry between Cham- 
bers and Spicer. Chambers 
was too complete a politician 
to pass up an opportunity to 
discredit General Spicer. 

His black pin-prick eyes 
darted up toward the time 
unit on the wall. 

“There’s no time to wait, 
Meyers,” he said eagerly. 
“Spicer knows the schedule. 
We must go without him.” 

Conscious of the stares of 
Meta and Meyers, I pushed 
the button which opened the 
door into the inner corridor. 

I looked directly at the 
Master Machine technician. “I 
asked Spicer to get a late re- 
port on the incident for us. 
But you know that Chambers 
is right — we cannot afford to 
wait any longer. Perhaps he’ll 
catch up.” 

We followed the corridor 
toward the hub of the Penta- 
gon. Senator Chambers led 
the way, almost at a trot, as 
though he were afraid that 
Spicer would catch up. Gen- 
eral Marshall and Meyers, 
hard put to keep up, were 
strung out behind him, with 
Meta and me bringing up the 
rear. 

That was the way we went 
through the check points man- 
ned by the security guards. 

ASSASSIN 



Twice I caught Meta looking 
at me. At one of the check 
points, I thought she was go- 
ing to say something. I lifted 
the tip of my cane and put my 
finger near the stud, but she 
remained silent. 

T he tension began to mount 
inside me as we approach- 
ed the door opening on the 
invisible force wall. Through 
the wall, I could see the squat, 
ugly building in the center of 
the hub of the Pentagon, 
which was our destination. I 
held my cane ready. But even 
a CT-bomb wouldn’t break 
through the force field. 

As we drew near the final 
guard point, a scrubwoman 
who had been working on the 
floor of the corridor picked up 
her bucket arid fell in with 
our party. 

Chambers was already ges- 
turing at the guard to set the 
combination, which would 
open the force wall at precise- 
ly 1330. I looked at the time 
unit on my wrist and saw that 
we had twenty seconds to 
wait. I resisted the betraying 
impulse to rub the irritated 
area around the electrodes set 
in my neck. 

When I looked up from the 
time unit, everything was too 
quiet. Senator Chambers was 
no longer dancing around im- 
patiently. He was staring at 
the bucket carried by the 
scrubwoman. 

The inside of the bucket 
was not even damp. And the 

47 




mop she had beeh using was 
dry. The implication must 
have hit both Chambers and 
me at the same moment. I 
wanted to shout a warning. 

Chambers jumped back 
against the wall, yelling at the 
guard, “Shoot her! Shoot! She 
is an alien !” 

The scrubwoman did the 
wrong thing. She turned and 
tried to run, her legs lifting 
awkwardly against the pull of 
the unaccustomed gravity. 
But the guard’s weapon was 
already at his shoulder. The 
low-velocity missile thudded 
into the body of the scrub- 
woman, flipping her up into 
the air in a graceless somer- 
sault. She landed on the con- 
crete floor with a second thud, 
which echoed softly down the 
long hall. A pool slowly wid- 
ened around her body and she 
lay still. 

I looked at my wrist time 
unit again. It was 1330. The 
door through the force wall 
was open. I went past the 
huddled heap lying on the 
floor, careful not to step in 
the pool of moisture. 

Too hideous to put into 
words in a public fac-report! 
That’s what the facsimile 
sheet had hinted about the 
broken body of the other 
"aUen.” Two from four left 
only two. But the door 
through the force wall was- 
open. I had to get through the 
door and into the building. 

Senator Chambers stepped 
out from behind the guard 

48 



and blocked the doorway. His 
little eyes flashed from one ex- 
pressionless face to another 
as he tried to come to some 
inner decision. His shoulders 
slumped, 

“I — I don’t like it,” he said. 
“The door is open now. I 
think perhaps we had better 
wait for General Spicer, after 
all.” 

But Meta shook her head 
and pushed past Chambers, 
She said, “No. You know the 
routine as well as we. Sena- 
tor. We are required to in- 
spect the unit. Leave the 
guard on duty here.” 

I TOOK advantage of the in- 
decision of the others and 
pushed through the door after 
her toward the squat, ugly lit- 
tle building that was my goal. 

Meta was almost to the 
door of the building when I 
heard Chambers yell. 

“Stop her. Secretary Bart- 
lett ! She’s malfunctioning. 
We’ve all been ordered to wait 
outside for an ID check,” I 
ignored him and he yelled 
again. “Guard, open fire on 
the girl. Don’t let her get in- 
side that door!” 

But he was too late. Meta 
disappeared through the door 
into the black building. I step- 
ped inside just as it slammed 
shut and the first missile 
smashed against the door 
from the guard’s weapon. 

The building was not large. 
The Master Machine squatted 
like a huge, thick-bodied black 

BASCOM JONES, JR. 




spider in the center of the 
building. A cobweb of power 
lines and control cables criss- 
crossed the floor and fed into 
the base of the unit. 

A myriad of tiny moving 
parts, levers and cams and 
elbowed arms and gears 
pulsed and shifted and moved 
to give the impression that 
the Master Machine was 
breathing, that it was alive. 
Tiny multicolored lights twin- 
kled on and off. Giant vacuum 
tubes hummed and glowed. 
And all the while, it munched 
on endless tapes. 

The black monster was the 
heart of Earth’s civilization, 
and it was the means of it. As 
I started toward the machine, 
a grid at the top turned slow- 
ly and ogled me. Almost im- 
mediately, a red tube blinked 
on, and the moving parts on 
one section of the machine 
plunged into a frenzied 
rhythm of action. 

I ran forward, breathing 
heavily under the strain of 
the unaccustomed gravity. I 
had only seconds in which to 
act. At any moment. Senator 
Chambers and the guards 
would be coming through the 
door behind me. 

I raised the cane and touch- 
ed the stud. 

The finger of lavender light 
knifed toward the machine, 
searching for its heart and 
memory unit. 

The ray fused and melted 
and burned, cutting deeper 
and deeper into the maze of 

ASSASSIN 



wires and tubes and relays. 
There was a blinding flash 
and one section of the ma- 
chine ground to a stop. Other 
sections immediately increas- 
ed their tempo of movement. 

Behind me the door slam- 
med open, and Senator 
Chambers and two |niard3 
stumbled into the building. 

Chambers yelled, “He's 
over there in front of the 
Master Machine. Hurry up 
. , . and . shoot ! Before it’s 
. too late ! Shoot!” 

His face almost a cherry 
red. Chambers danced out of 
the way. The guards raised 
their weapons and sighted. 

Then the ray from my cane 
cut deeply into the very inner- 
most section of the master 
unit and the machine died. A 
dial on the front of the black- 
ened, twisted mess spun slow- 
ly to a stop. There was no 
more noise and no more move- 
ment. 

It was done. 

A S I released the stud on the 
cane, the weapons of the 
guards were pointed directly 
at my back. Chambers’ eyes 
were like two black marbles, 
staring at me, his head strain- 
ed forward to watch the re- 
sults of the missiles. 

I took a careful step to the 
left. And another. And then 
another. They didn’t move. 

The guards’ weapons re- 
mained trained on the spot 
where I had been standing. 
Senator Chambers continued 

49 




staring at the place where I 
had been. 

None of them moved. They 
remained there, pointing at 
nothing. The electrodes at the 
bases of their necks reflecting 
the molten glow from the 
wrecked Master Machine. 

I relaxed. I rubbed the 
tender skin around the dum- 
my electrodes set in my neck. 
It was finally over. 

Then a shadow moved 
against the wall where there 
should have been no move- 
ment. It len£,chened and took 
on the shapely form of the 
redheaded Meta. 

Only now her eyes were no 
longer dead and expression- 
less. They were alive with 
feeling. 

I said, “So you are the other 
one. I should have guessed 
when you ran into the build- 
ing ahead of me. But I was too 
busy thinking of those guards 
and of Chambers.” 

She nodded. Her lips relax- 
ed into a smile. 

Two from four leaves two! 
But we had accomplished our 
mission. And outside the 
building, in Washington, Lon- 
don, New York — in every 
Earth city — figures on the 
streets, in office buildings, and 
at home had become motion- 
less, poised like mechanical 
toys with their springs run 
down. Housewives, cab driv- 
ers, copter pilots, passengers, 
shoppers, policemen, govern- 
ment workers had ceased to 
move, had stopped funcUon- 

50 



ing with the destruction of 
the Master Machine. 

The redhead said, “It’s real- 
ly over, isn’t it? They’re stop- 
ped.” She looked at the still 
figures, the dummy electrodes 
in her neck quivering in a 
shiver. “They can’t kill any 
more?” 

I said, “It’s over.” 

“They can’t destroy or 
move?” 

“Without the Master Ma- 
chine, they have no power 
supply — nothing. And they 
can’t kill or destroy.” 

She walked over to look at 
the figures. “What went 
wrong? What happened to 
them?” 

I shrugged. “You can’t 
blame them any more than 
you can blame a boiler that 
explodes or a dam that breaks. 
It was the human race itself 
that was responsible for what 
happened. We became lazy, 
careless. We built too many 
time saving gimmicks to do 
too many jobs for us.” 

<‘1>UT the machines were 
designed to help us,” she 
said. “To make life better and 
more pleasant.” 

“At the beginning,” I 
agreed, “but we didn’t know 
where to stop. We started 
with labor-saving devices. We 
replaced ourselves in fac- 
tories, offices, restaurants, 
stores. Still it wasn’t enough. 
We designed robots to serve 
as traffic policemen, to drive 
cars, and to handle thinking

tasks. Then we designed hu- 
manoid robots, mechanical 
replicas of man and woman, 
controlled by the computing 
sections of the Master Ma- 
chine, activated by its power 
supply, able to move and talk 
and think. We used them as 
servants. We had the means 
to replace ourselves complete- 
ly — everywhere.” 

“Why did they turn on the 
human race ? she asked. 

I pointed to the smoldering 
wreck of the Master Machine 
in the center of the room. 
“Perhaps there was a weak 
circuit, or a tape was garbled, 
or a relay didn’t close proper- 
ly. The scientific colony on the 
Moon helped some of us to 
escape. The rest of mankind 
was destroyed by the robots — 
systematically and ruthless- 
ly.” 

The redhead shivered again 
and walked over to the door 
leading from the building. She 
stood there, looking up at the 



thin curve of the Moon show- 
ing in the blue of the after- 
noon sky. 

Finally she said, “Up there, 
by now, they will know that 
we have accomplished our 
mission. In a few hours, they 
will be filing out of the under- 
ground caverns and loading 
onto the giant rockets. They’ll 
be coming back. But only the 
very oldest will have been on 
Earth before. Like us, thou- 
sands of them will be coming 
to a new world for the first 
time. A world of beauty and 
opportunity — if they want it 
that way. What will they de- 
cide?” 

What would they decide? 

I looked down at the red- 
head. Deep in her eyes, I saw 
the emotions which no hu- 
manoid robot could ever know. 
I saw them, and suddenly the 
tension eased out of my mus- 
cles. 

The answer to her question 
was in her own eyes. end

THE 
POLITE 
PEOPLE 

OF 

PUDIBUNDIA 




By R. A. LAFFERTY 




«T¥TELL, you will soon see 
^ for yourself, Marlow. 
Yes I know there are peculiar 
stoi’ies about the place. There 
are about all places. The young 
pilots who have been there tell 
some amusing tales about it.” 
“Yes. They say the people 
there are very polite.” 

“That is the honorable an- 
cestor of all understatements. 
One of the pilots, Conrad, told 
us that the inhabitants must 
always carry seven types of 
eyeglasses with them. None 
of the Puds, you see, may ever 



gaze directly on another. That 
would be the height of impo- 
liteness. They wear amber gog- 
gles when they go about their 
world at large, and these they 
wear when they meet a stran- 
ger. But, once they are intro- 
duced to him then they must 
thereafter look on him through 
blue glasses. But at a blood 
relative they gaze through red, 
and at an in-law through yel- 
low. There are equally in- 
teresting colors for other 
situations.” 

“I would like to talk to Con- 

53 



rad. Not that I doubt his re- 
ports. It is the things he did 
not report that interest me.” 
“I thought you knew he had 
died. Thrombosis, though he 
was sound enough when first 
certified.” 

“But if they are really peo- 
ple, then it should be possible 
to understand them.” 

“But they are not really peo- 
ple. They are metamorphics. 
They become people only out 
of politeness.” 

“Detail that a little." 

"Oh, they’re biped and of 
a size of us. They have a cha- 
meleon-like skin that can take 
on any texture they please, 
and they possess extreme plas- 
ticity of features.” 

“You mean they can take on 
the appearance of people at 
will?” 

“So Bently reported." 

“I hadn’t heard of him.” 
“Another of the young pi- 
lots. According to Bently, not 
only do the Puds take on a 
human appearance, they take 
on the appearance of the hu- 
man they encounter. Out of 
politeness, of course.” 

“Quite a tribute, though it 
seems extreme. Could I talk to 
Bently?” 

“Also dead. A promising 
young man. But he reported 
some of the most amusing as- 
pects of all: the circumlocu- 
tions that the Puds use in 
speaking our language. Not 
only is the Second Person es- 
chewed out of politeness, but 
in a way all the other Persons 

54 



also. One of them could not 
call you by your name, Marlow. 
He would have to say; ‘One 
hears of one who hears of one 
of the noble name of Marlow. 
One hears of one even now in 
his presence.’ ” 

“"Y^ES, that is quite a polite 

^ way of saying it. But it 
would seem that with all their 
circumlocutions they would be 
inefficient.” 

“Yet they are quite efficient. 
They do things so well that it 
is almost imperative that we 
learn from them. Yet for all 
our contacts, for all their ex- 
treme politeness coupled with 
their seeming openness, we 
have been able to learn almost 
nothing. We cannot learn the 
secret of the amazing pro- 
ductivity of their fields. Ac- 
cording to Sharper, another of 
the young pilots, they suggest 
(though so circumspectly that 
it seems hardly a suggestion, 
certainly not a criticism) that 
if we were more polite to our 
own plants, the plants would 
be more productive for us ; and 
if we gave the plants the ulti- 
mate of politeness, they would 
give us the ultimate of pro- 
duction.” 

“Could I talk to Sharper, or 
is he also — ” 

“No, he is not dead. He waa 
quite well till the last several 
days. Now, however, he is ail- 
ing, but I believe it will be pos- 
sible for you to talk to him 
before you leave, if he does 
not worsen.” 



R. A. lAFFERTY 




“It would still seem difficult 
for the Puds to get anything 
done. Wouldn’t a superior be 
too polite to give a reprimand 
to an inferior?” 

“Probably. But Masters, 
who visited them, had a theory 
about it, which is that the in- 
ferior would be so polite and 
deferential that he would do 
his best to anticipate a wish or 
a desire, or would go to any 
lengths to learn the import of 
an unvoiced preference.” 

“Is Masters one of the young 
pilots?” 

“No, an old-timer.” 

“Now you do interest me.” 
“Dead quite a few years. But 
it is you who interest me, Mar- 
low. I have been told to give 
you all the information you 
need about the Polite People 
of Pudibundia. And on the sub- 
ject of the Polite People, I 
must also be polite. But — sav- 
ing your presence, and one 
hears of one who hears and all 
that — ^what in gehenna is a 
captain in Homicide on the So- 
lar Police Force going to Pudi- 
bundia about?” 

“About murder. That is all 
I ever go anywhere about. We 
once had a private motto that 
we would go to the end of the 
Earth to solve a case.” 

“And now you have amended 
your motto to ‘to the end of 
the Earth and beyond’?” 

“We have.” 

“But what have the Polite 
People to do with murder? 
Crime is unknown on Pudi- 
bundia.” 



“We believe^ saving their 
feelings, that it may not be 
unknown there. And what I am 
going to find out is this. There 
have been pilots for many 
years who have brought back 
stories of the Puds, and there 
are still a few — a very few — 
young pilots alive to tell those 
stories. What I am going to 
find out is why there are no 
old pilots around telling those 
stories.” 

I T wasn’t much of a trip for 
a tripper, six weeks. And 
Marlow was well received. His 
host also assumed the name of 
Marlow out of politeness. It 
would have been impossible to 
render his own name in hu- 
man speech, and it would have 
been impossible for him to con- 
ceive of using any name ex- 
cept that of his guest, with its 
modifiers. Yet there was no 
confusion. Marlow was Mar- 
low, and his host was the One- 
Million - Times - Lesser - Mar- 
low. 

“We could progress much 
faster,” said Marlow, “if we 
dispensed with these formali- 
ties.” 

“Or assumed them as 
already spoken,” said the One- 
Million - Times - Lesser - Mar- 
low. “For this, in private, but 
only in the strictest privacy, 
we use the deferential ball. 
Within it are all the formulae 
written minutely. You have 
but to pass the ball from hand 
to hand every time you speak, 
and it is as if the amenities

were spoken. I will give you 
this for the time of your stay. I 
beg you never to forget to pass 
it from hand to hand every 
time you speaki Should you for- 
get, I would not, of course, be 
allowed to notice it. But when 
you were gone, I should be 
forced to kill myself for the 
shame of it. For private rea- 
sons I wish to avoid this and 
therefore beseech you to be 

The One - Million - Times- 
Lesser - Marlow (hweafter to 
be called OMTLM for conven- 
ience but not out of any lack 
of politeness) gave Mai’low a 
deferential ball, about the size 
of a ping-pong ball. And so 
they talked. 

“As a police official, I am 
particularly interested in the 
crime situation on Pud,” said 
Marlow. “An index of zero 
is — well, if I could find a po- 
liter word I - would use it — 
suspicious. And as you are, as 
well as I can determine, the 
head police official here, though 
in politeness your office would 
have another name, I am hop- 
ing that you can give me in- 
formation.” 

“Saving your grace, and 
formula of a formula, what 
would you have me tell you 
about?” 

“Suppose that a burglar (for 
politeness sake called some- 
thing else) were apprehended 
by a policeman (likewise), 
what would happen ?”- 

“Why, the policeman (not 
so called, and yet we must be 

56 



frank) 'would rattle his glottis 
in the prescribed manner.” 
“Rattle his gl — I see. He 
would clear his throat with the 
appropriate sound. And then 
the burglar (not so called) ?” 
“Would be covered with 
shame, it is true, but not fa- 
tally. For the peace of his own 
soul, he would leave the site 
in as dignified a manner as 
possible.” 

“With or without boodle?” 
“Naturally without. One ap- 
prehended in the act is obliged 
to abandon his loot. That is 
only common politeness.” 

“I see. And if the burglar 
(not so called) remains unap- 
prehended ? How is the loss of 
the goods or property re- 
corded?” 

“It goes into the coefficient 
of general diminution of mer- 
chandise, which is to say 
shrinkage, wastage or loss. At 
certain times and places this 
coefficient becomes alarmingly 
large. Then it is necessary to 
use extraordinary care ; and in 
extreme cases a thrice-re- 
moved burglar may become so 
ashamed of himself that he 
will die.” 

“That he will die of shame? 
Is that a euphemism?” 

“Let us say that it is a eu- 
phemism of a euphemism.” 
“Thrice-removed, I imagine. 
And what of other crimes?” 

H ere OMTLM rattled his 
glottis in a nervous man- 
ner, and Marlow hurriedly 
transferred his deferential 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




ball to the other hand, having 
nearly forgotten it. 

“There being no crime, we 
can hardly speak of other 
crimes,” said OMTLM. “But 
perhaps in another matter of 
speaking, you refer to — ” 

“Crimes of violence,” said 
Marlow. 

“Saving your presence, and 
formula of a formula, what 
would we have to be violent 
about? What possible cause?” 

“The usual: greed, lust, 
jealousy, anger, revenge, plain 
perversity." 

“Here also it is possible for 
J)ne to die of shame, some- 
times the offender, sometimes 
the victim, sometimes both. A 
jealous person might permit 
both his wife and her para- 
mour to die of shame. And 
the State in turn might per- 
mit him to perish likewise, un- 
less there were circumstances 
to modify the degree of 
shame ; then he might still con- 
tinue to live, often in circum- 
scribed circumstances, for a 
set number of years. Each 
case must be decided on its 
own merits.” 

“I understand your mean- 
ing. But why build a fence 
around it?” 

“1 do not know what you 
mean.” 

“I believe that you do. Why 
are the Polite People of Pudi- 
bundia so polite? Is it simply 
custom?” 

“•It is more than that,” said 
the polite Pud. 

“Then there is a real reason 



for it? And can you tell it to 
me?” 

“There is a real reason for 
it. 1 cannot tell it to you now, 
though, and perhaps not ever. 
But there is a chance that you 
may be given a demonstration 
of it ju.st before you leave. 
And if you are very wise, you 
may be able then to guess the 
reason. I believe that there are 
several who have guessed it. 
1 hope that we will have time 
for other discussions before 
you leave our sphere. And I 
sincerely do hope that your 
stay on Pundibundia is a 
pleasant one. And now, saving 
your presence, we must part. 
Formula of a formula.” 

“Formula of a formula and 
all that,” said Marlow, and 
went to discover the pleasures 
of Pudibundia. 

Among the pleasures of Pud 
was Mitzi (Miniature Image 
a thousand-times-removed of 
the Ze.stful Irma) who had 
now shaped up into something 
very nice. And shaped up is 
the correct term. 

At first Marlow was shock- 
ed by the appearance of all the 
females he met on Pud. Crude- 
featured, almost horse-faced, 
how could they all look like 
that? And he was even more 
shocked when he finally real- 
ized the reason. He had be- 
come used to the men there 
looking like himself out of po- 
liteness. And this — this abom- 
ination — was the female 

version of his own appear- 
ance 1 



THE POLfTE PEOPLE OF PUDIBUNDIA 



57 




But he was a man of re- 
sources. He took from his 
pocket a small picture of Irma 
that he always carried, and 
showed it to the most friendly 
of the girls. 

“Could you possibly — ?” 
“Look like that? Why, of 
course. Let me study it for a 
moment. Now, then.” 

So the girl assumed the face 
of Irma. 

“Incredible,” said Marlow, 
“except Irma is red-headed.” 
“You have only to ask. The 
photo is not colored and so I 
did not know. We will try this 
shade to start with.” 

“Close, but could you turn it 
just a little darker?” 

“Of course.” 

And there she was Irma of 
the most interesting face and 
wonderful hair. But the pic- 
ture had been of the face only. 
Below that, the girl was a 
sack. If only there were some 
way to convey what was lack- 
ing. 

“You still are not pleased 
with me,” said the Miniature 
Image a thousand-times-re- 
moved of the Zestful Irma 
(Mitzi). “But you have only 
to demonstrate. Show me with 
your hands.” 

Marlow with his hands 
sculptured in the air the figure 
of Irma as he remembered it, 
and Mitzi assumed the form, 
first face on, then face away, 
then in profile. And when they 
had it roughly, they perfected 
it, a little more here, a little 
'less there. But there were 



points where his memory fail- 
ed him. 

“If you could only give me 
an idea of the convolutions of 
her ears,” said Mitzi, “and the 
imderlying structure of the 
metatarsus. My only desire is 
to please. Or shall I improvise 
where you do not remember?” 
“Yes, do that, Mitzi.” 

And how that girl could im- 
provise ! 

M arlow and Mitzi were 
now buddies. They made 
a large evening of it. They tied 
one on ; formula of a formula, 
but they tied one on. They 
went on a thrice-removed 
bender. At the Betelgeuse Bar 
and Grill, they partook of the 
cousin of the cousin of the al- 
cohol itself in the form of the 
nono-rhumbezoid, made of 
nine kinds of rum. At the B- 
flat Starlight Club, they lis- 
tened to the newest and most 
exciting music on all Pudi- 
bundia. At Alligator John’s, 
one checks his inhibitions at 
the door. Here one also checks 
his deferential ball. Of course 
the formulae are built into the 
walls and at each exchange it 
is always assumed that they 
are said. 

But the Iris Room is really 
the ultimate. The light comes 
through seven different colors 
of glass, and it is very dim 
when it arrives. And there the 
more daring remove their gog- 
gles entirely and go about 
without them in the multi- 
colored twilight. This is il- 



58 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




legal. It is even foolhardy. 
There is no Earthly equivalent 
to it. To divest oneself and 
disport with Nudists would be 
tame in comparison. But Mitzi 
and her friends were of the 
reckless generation^ and the 
Iris Room was their rendez- 
vous. 

The orgy will not be detail- 
ed here. The floor show was 
wild. Yet we cannot credit the 
rumor that the comedian was 
so crude as to look directly at 
the audience even in that col- 
ored twilight ; or they so 
gauche as to laugh outright at 
the jokes, they who had been 
taught always to murmur, 
“One knows of one who knows 
of one who ventures to smile.” 
Yet there was no doubting 
that the Iris Room was a live- 
ly place. And when they left it 
at dawn, Marlow was pleased 
and sleepy and tipsy. 

There was a week of pleas- 
ure on Pudibundia : swimming 
with Mitzi down at West 
Beach, gourmandizing with 
Mitzi at Gastrophiles, dancing 
with Mitzi, pub-crawling, ro- 
mancing, carrying on general- 
ly. The money exchange was 
favorable and Marlow was on 
an expense account. It was a 
delightful time. 

But still he did not forget 
the job he was on, and in the 
midst of his pleasure he 
sought always for informa- 
tion. 

“When I return here,” he 
said slyly, “we will do the 
many things that time does 



not allow. When I come back 
here — ” 

“But you will not return,” 
said MitzL “Nobody ever 
does.” 

“And why not? It is surely 
a pleasant place to return to. 
Why won’t I return?” 

“If you cannot guess, then I 
cannot tell you. Do you have 
to know why?” 

“Yes, I have to know why. 
That is why I came he>e, to 
find out. To find out why the 
young men who come here will 
never be able to return here, 
or to anywhere else.” 

“I can’t tell you.” 

“Then give me a clue.” 

“In the Iris Room was a 
clue. It was not till the color- 
filtered light intruded between 
us that we might safely take 
off our goggles. I would save 
you if I could. I want you to 
come back. But those higher in 
authority make the decisions. 
When you leave, you will not 
return here, or anywhere else. 
But already one has spoken to 
one who has spoken to one 
who has spoken too much.” 
“There is a point beyond 
which politeness is no longer 
a virtue, Mitzi.” 

“I know. If I could change 
it, I would.” 

S O THE period of the visit 
was at an end, and Marlow 
was at his last conference with 
OMTLM, following which he 
would leave Pudibundia, per- 
haps forever. 

“Is there anything at all 

59 



THE POLITE PEOPLE OF PUDIBUNDIA 




else you would like to know?” 
asked OMTLM. 

“There is almost everything 
that I still want to know. I 
have found out nothing,” 

“Then ask.” 

“I don’t know how. If I 
knew the questions to ask, it is 
possible that I would already 
know the answers.” 

“Yes, that is entirely pos- 
sible.” 

OMTLM seemed to look at 
him with amused eyes. And 
yet the eyes were hidden be- 
hind purple goggles. Marlow 
had never seen the eyes of 
OMTLM. He had never seen 
the eyes of any of the Puds. 
Even in the Iris Room, in that 
strangely colored light, it had 
not been possible to see their 
eyes. 

“Are you compelling me to 
do something?” asked Mar- 
low. 

“I may be compelling you to 
think of the question that has 
eluded you.” 

“Would you swear that I 
have not been given some fatal 
sickness?” 

“I can swear that to the 
very best of my knowledge you 
have not.” 

“Are you laughing at me 
with your eyes?” 

“No. My eyes have com- 
passion for you.” 

“I have to see them.” 

“You are asking that?” 

“Yes. I believe the answer 
to my question is there,” Mar- 
low said firmly. 

OMTLM took off his purple 



goggles. His were clear, intel- 
ligent eyes and there was gen- 
uine compassion in them. 

“Thank you,” said Marlow. 
“If the answer is there, it still 
eludes me. I have failed in my 
mission for information. But 
I will return again. I will still 
find out what it is that is 
wrong here.” 

“No, you will not return.” 

“What will prevent me?” 
asked Marlow. 

“Your death in a very few 

“What will I die of?” 

“What did all your young 
pilots die of?” 

“But you swore that you did 
not know of any sickness I 
could have caught here !” Mar- 
low cried. 

“That was true when I said 
it. It was not true a moment 
later.” 

“Did all the pilots ask to see 
your eyes?” 

“Yes. All. Curiosity is a 
failing of you Earthlings.” 

“Is it that the direct gaze of 
the Puds kills?” 

“Yes. Even ourselves it 
would kill. That is why we 
have our eyes always shielded. 
That is also why we erect an- 
other shield : that of our ritual 
politeness, so that we may 
never forget that too intimate 
an encounter of our persons 
may be fatal.” 

“Then you have just mur- 
dered me?” 

“Let us say rather that one 
hears of one who hears of one 
who killed unwillingly.” 



60 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




“Why did you do it to me?” 
demanded Marlow. 

“You asked to see my eyes.. 
It would not be polite to re- 
fuse.’’ 

“It takes you several weeks 
to kill. I can do it in a few 
seconds.” 

“You would be wrong to 
try. Our second glance kills in- 
stantly.” 

“Let’s see if it’s faster than 
a gun!” 



B ut OMTLM had not lied. 

It is not polite to lie on 
Pudibundia. 

Marlow died instantly. 

And that is why (though 
you may sometimes hear a 
young pilot tell amusing 
stories immediately— oh, very 
immediately — on his return 
from Pudibundia) you will 
never find an old pilot who 
has ever been there. 

END 



THAT OTHER GALAXY 

How’s your star gazing? These cold-weather nights give you a good 
chance to see some interesting sights, even with the naked eye. 

For instance, probably you can locate the constellation Casseiopia. It’s 
in the northern part of the sky, shaped like a wobbly sort of letter ‘‘W”, 
and if you locate the Big Dipper, proceed to the Pole Star and keep going 
an equal distance on the other side, you can’t miss it. 

A little farther in the same direction— oh, say about the apparent length 
of Casseiopia’s *‘W” itself — you’ll find something about as bright as a 
star, but queerly fuzzy in appearance. That’s the Great Nebula in Androm- 
eda — M-31, as astronomers call it — a galaxy about as big as our own 
and, presumably, with just as many planets, just as high a percentage of 
which can bear civilized, intelligent life. 

What you see, of course, is only the core of the galaxy — ^the densely 
populated inner globe where stars are relatively close together. A big 
telescope will show a spiraling cloud of arms, but they are so sparsely 
scattered that the aggregate of their light makes no impression on low- 
powered instruments, including that low-powered instrument we carry 
around with us, the eye. 

M-31’s core is exactly matched in our own galaxy. We call it the Milky 
Way. And our own sun? That’s in one of the spiraling arms. 

So it will do you no good to wave to a possible Andromedan observer— 
he can’t even see our sun, much less you. And if he could, it might take him 
a while to wave back. The round-trip time for light takes some three 
million years.

THE POLITE PEOPLE OF PUDIBUNDIA 61 




The apartment was empty. So was she. But not for long. 






YASSI 



By ART LEWIS 



T he apartment is call- 
ed a single. It contains a 
Murphy bed, a chest of draw- 
ers, an overstuffed chair, a 
sofa, a coffee table, a seven- 
teen-inch television set, a 
bookcase partially filled with 
the volumes A through F of an 
encylopedia from the super- 
market, assorted paperback 
books, and a radio that doesn’t 
work. In the ceiling is a fix- 
ture with two twenty-five- 
watt bulbs. A short hallway 
leads to the bathroom and the 
kitchen. 

Julia Fenway stood outside 
her apartment, fumbling in 
her bag for her keys. She had 
never had any trouble finding 
her keys before. Her purse 
was always neat and orderly. 
And she was breathing hard. 
Breathing hard from the short 
walk from the bus at tiie cor-

ner and down the long corridor 
to the private, the lonesome 
apartment door. 

Those keys ! Where are 
those keys! I’m becoming a 
regular pack rat lately. Look 
at that bag! Did you ever see 
so much junk? She thrust her 
hand deep inside and felt 
around. A crumpled kleenex, 
worn-out lipstick, change 
purse, pencils, movie stubs . 
a coldness, the keys. Her heart 
was pounding. She pressed the 
hand with the keys to her bos- 
om. It was pounding. At least 
it was working. 

She managed to get the door 
open just as the landlady’s 
door down the hall gushed 
forth cooked cabbage odor and 
Mrs. Shultz stuck her head 
out. Julia closed her door be- 
hind her until she heard the 
lock click. Of all the people in 



62 




the world, why was it the Mrs. 
Shultzes she attracted? 

At the sound of the lock, the 
cat. Belle, poked her head out 
of the kitehen. She walked 
lazily into the room, rubbing 
her side along the wall to 
scratch off the sleep. Then she 
leaped to the top of the dress- - 
er and started to wash herself. 

J ULIA STOOD with her back 
against the door. Her arms, 
tired of reaching out, hung 
limply against her sides. A ray 
of sunlight streamed through 
the partly open window and a 
little pool of it snuggled on 
her pillow. It had been such 
a long ride in from Beverly 
Hills and on two buses. She 
had sat in the back where it 
wasn’t so crowded and the 
smell of exhaust was still in 
her nostrils. 

She walked over to the 
dresser and put her purse 
down beside the cat and 
ran her fingers caressingly 
through the soft fur. Belle 
took a swipe with a hind paw. 
Julia rested her head on the 

“I’m going to die. Belle.” 
The cat sat up and lifted a 
front paw. She washed it with 
little delicate strokes from her 
tongue. 

Julia moved over to the bed 
and sat down on the edge of it. 
She slipped her shoes off. Her 
feet hurt. They always hurt in 
heels. Why does one get dress- 
ed up to see the doctor? He 
could have told her she had 



six months to live while she 
was wearing flats. 

He didn’t actually blurt it 
out as I walked in the door. 
He fooled around under that 
sheet for a long time. And 
then he said it. No, not then 
either. He just looked pained 
and hurt and a little white 
around the lips and he told me 
to get dressed and come into 
his office. He had the lab re- 
ports on his desk and he 
pounded on them and he said 
you’re as good as dead now! 

I wish he had ! Then I could 
hate him. I could hate instead 
of feeling numb all over. He 
didn’t want to tell me any- 
thing. Just get ready for an 
operation. No, there really 
wasn’t any rush. But soon. 
And then I dragged it out of 
him. I insisted I had a right 
to know. It was my life. No, 
I don’t have any family here. 
No one ... no one! A brother 
in New York. Don’t call him! 
The doctor stammered like a 
schoolboy who’s unprepared in 
class. 

Julia fell back on the bed. 
She stared at the unlighted 
ceiling fixture. She should cry, 
but she’d cried in the doctor’s 
office and there was nothing 
left to cry. Six months to live. 
Maybe only five months. Cer- 
tainly no more than seven with 
the operation. 

A spring in the bed got her 
in the back. She ought to tell 
Mrs. Shultz to fix that. She 
certainly didn’t want to spend 
her last six months sleeping 

63 



VASSI 




on a loose spring. Spend her 
last six months ! 

She turned over on her 
stomach and pressed her face 
into the blanket. Her body was 
rigid. She tried to contemplate 
her own death. She should call 
her brother. No, she would die 
first. 

“Hello, excuse me, my name 
is Vassi.” 

Julia raised her head and 
looked around the room. It was 
empty. 

“Would you say this is a 
typical prior dwelling?” 

Julia sat up. There was 
no one. 

“Oh, I hadn’t thought of 
that possibility. I suppose we 
don’t have a similar frame of 
reference. You’ll never under- 
stand my thoughts.” 

S HE GOT off the bed. She 
walked around the room 
and her stocking feet made 
little padded sounds on the cot- 
ton carpet. Then she crossed 
to the door of the apartment 
and pressed her ear against 
it. 

“Are you a ventriloquist?” 
she said. 

“A ventriloquist? Oh, my, 
no. I’m an historian.” The 
voice was in her head. 

“I’m insane.” It had to hap- 
pen. She touched her finger- 
tips to her mouth. 

“Is that so? That’s too bad. 
We’re over and done with that 
sort of thing.” 

“I’ll wash my face with cold 
water. It must be the strain. 

64 



I shouldn’t have forced the 
doctor . .” 

“You are alone, aren’t you? 
I looked around rather care- 
fully. I didn’t see anyone ex- 
cept that . that thing on that 
piece of furniture.” 

Julia looked at Belle. The 
cat was asleep on the dresser. 
She started to walk to the 
bathroom but stopped in front 
of the bed and sat down. Her 
head was going to burst. 

“Please” she said. “Please 
stop.” 

“I really don’t want to in- 
trude. But I have my recorder 
right here. It won’t take long 
and then I must move on. Now 
I notice you’re fully dressed. 
Most remarkable. We always 
thought you prior people in- 
dulged in sex orgies alnwst 
continuously.” 

“My God!” 

“Your thoughts are con- 
fused. Is it because you’re in- 
sane? You haven’t had much 
experience in thought projec- 
tion, have you?” 

Julia jumped from the bed 
and ran into the bathroom. 
She locked the door behind her 
and turned on the cold water 
full force. She cupped her 
hands under the faucet and 
plunged her face into the cas- 
cading coldness. 

My name is Julia Fenway. 
I’m a file clerk at Continental 
Insurance. I’m going to die 
and I’m not preoccupied with 
sex. 

She turned off the faucet 
and stared into the sink. The 



ART LEWIS 




water gathered into a little 
whirlpool and disappeared 
down the drain. There- was a 
knock on the bathroom door. 

The voice was in her head. 
“I wonder if I could see that. 
We have some rather indis- 
tinct writings on running wa- 
ter. I’d like to bring them up 
to date.” 

The cold water didn’t help. 
If anything, it was worse 
now. The knocking came from 
the door. She was sure of it. 
But the voice . the voice 
was inside her. 

“May I come in?” 

Julia sat down on the edge 
of the tub. She squeezed her 
head between her hands. I 
don’t deserve this. What did 
I do to deserve this? 

“Please. I’m on a tight 
schedule.” 

“So am I! Go away!” She 
was talking to it. She was 
talking to the voice in her 
head. 

Then it was very quiet. 
Julia watched the door, wait- 
ing for someone to walk 
through its solidness. Noth- 
ing happened. She lowered 
her head and started to count 
the tiny tiles in the floor. 

If I count one row very 
carefully, it will take me five 
minutes, two rows ten min- 
utes, three rows . 

She started to count. 

S SHE was midway 
through the fourth row, 
the voice said, “I don’t think 
you realize the importance of 

VASSI 



my visit. We recognize your 
right of privacy, but don’t 
you feel in this case . ?” 

Julia jumped up and pulled 
open the door. “Let me die in 
peace !” 

She ran into the other 
room and stood in the middle 
of it, looking all around, 
breathing hard. Belle leaped 
down from the dresser, her 
doze finished, and rubbed 
against Julia’s leg. 

The water in the bathroom 
was running. 

She hadn’t shut it oflf. But 
she had. She had. 

The water started again. It 
stopped. It started. It stopped. 

“How quaint.” 

There is someone here! 

“Who are you?” 

“Vassi.” 

“Vassi?” 

"I’m chief historian, re- 
search division. It’s my first 
trip in time. The scientists 
have been playing around 
with this thing for years and 
they’ve only just let us take 
it over.” 

A time traveler! Julia stood 
very still. Her eyes searched 
the room slowly once again. 
The window was open about 
three inches. Too small for 
anyone to squeeze through. 
The door was locked from the 
inside. There was absolutely 
no one in the room. In her 
desperate state, she was hunt- 
ing for an out. She was in- 
volved in a fairy story. Her 
body started to relax. 

“I can’t see you, Mr. Vassi.” 

65 





I can’t accept death. I’m 
looking for escape. 

“You can’t see me? I’m 
standing right in front of 
you.” 

“I can’t see you." 

“I don’t understand. I can 
see you. Here, take my hand.” 
For a moment, Julia hoped. 
There was nothing. 

“Why, I can’t touch you!” 
Not even a breath of wind. 
Julia walked over to the 
dresser and took a package of 
cigarettes out of her handbag., 
She carried it over to the sofa 
and sat down. 

“You walked through me!” 
She lit the cigarette, in- 
haled deeply and blew out the 
smoke in a long steady 
stream. When she was a little 
girl and she had a sharp pain 
in her side, her mother would 
say it’s only gas, hold on, it’ll 
pass. 

She would hold on . 
Mother, help me! 

The voice in her head. “I 
wish I had paid more atten- 
tion to those scientists. What 
was it they said? 1 had so 
much to do before 1 left. 
Something about transport- 
ing living matter . Are you 
$ure I’m invisible?” 

“I can’t see you.” 

“Do you people have trou- 
ble with your eyes? No, that’s 
not it. I can’t touch you. And 
I’d expected to bring back 
some artifacts. I am terribly 
disappointed.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“And well you might be. 



It’s going to be extremely dif- 
ficult going around asking 
people a lot of questions when 
they can’t see me. You must 
have had quite a start.” 

“Stop it! Stop it! My head. 
Oh, dear God, my head!” 
Julia got up. “I’m going out!” 
“You are having trouble 
with the thought projection. 
I’ll sit down and be quiet for 
a moment.” 

T he voice stopped. Julia 
paused at the door. The 
room was quiet. Breathing! 
She heard breathing. Her 
own? She held her breath. It 
was there in the room. She 
was sure of it. 

It was a whisper in her 
throat. “You are real.” 

The faucet, the water, the 
knock on the door. “You are 
real!” 

If she held on, it would pass 
like gas. “You are real!” 

She moved trancelike back 
into the room. 

“You see me now.” 

“No. I heard you breathe.” 
“Can you touch me?” 

“No.” 

She heard her own blood in 
her ears. Her own breath 
forced itself between her lips. 
His breathing was gone. It 
was a dream. 

She said, “You’re gone.” 
“Over here on the arm of 
the couch.” 

She turned. She fought to 
silence herself. Sbe heard the 
soft breathing from the direc- 
tion of the couch.

“Who are you, Mr. Vassi?” 

“It’s just Vassi, no mister. 
I already told you who and 
what I am.” 

“A time traveler from some 
distant future,” she said. 

“Most of your records dis- 
appeared in the final war. We 
want to pick up the traces. 
Best way to do that is to trav- 
el back in time.” 

“It sounds like such a long 
way. How long?” 

If it was true, it was a 
miracle. If it wasn’t . Julia, 
you’re a realist! 

“It would be a meaningless 
term for you. It’s an age, an 
eon away.” 

Julia sat down on the edge 
of the overstuffed chair. She 
noticed a faint layer of dust 
on the coffee table. The apart- 
ment looked messy with the 
bed out of the wall. Ever since 
the first visit to the doctor 
three weeks ago, she hadn’t 
thought of cleaning. 

“I’m afraid the apartment 
doesn’t look very presenta- 
ble.” 

“Aren’t you comforted to 
know that the world has sur- 
vived?” 

“But I won’t survive.” She 
looked at the dust again. “ Y ou 
see, I don’t do much enter- 
taining.” 

“Is that so? I wouldn’t 
know. Do you mind if I record 
our conversation?” 

“I don’t mind. It’s nice to 
have someone to talk to, even 
if I can’t see you.” Julia, 
you’re a realist I 

VASSI 



“Yes. Well, that is a bother. 
Now would you mind telling 
me a few pertinent facts 
about civilization as you know 
it?” 

“1 don’t think I know too 
much about that sort of 
thing,” said Julia. 

«T’D HOPED to land in the 
* middle of a library of 
some sort ...” His voice broke 
off. “You don’t seem to have 
much of a collection of books 
here.” 

Julia said, “Are you near 
the bookcase?” 

“No wonder the records 
didn’t last, if this is the way 
they were kept.” 

“Vassi, can you touch the 
books?” She got up and went 
to the bookcase. 

“Yes.” 

"Pick one up.” 

“They’re no use to me. This 
isn’t history.” 

“Pick one up!” 

“1 haven’t got the time. I 
have to move on.” 

“Vassi, you touched the 
faucet, didn’t you? And you 
knocked on the door.” 

“Ye.s . That does mean 
I can b»*ing back artifacts!” 
“Why can’t you touch me?” 
“Now 1 have to get to a 
place that will do me some 
good. A library, a store, isn’t 
that what you call them? A 
museum . Are any of these 
things nearby?” 

“Let me go with you. I’ll 
be your gmide. I’ll — I’ll show 
you my time.” 

67 





“But won’t you be uncom- 
fortable? I’m invisible.” 

“I don’t care! No one can 
steal you from me this way.” 

“Steal me?” 

“Vassi, why can’t you touch 
me!” 

“I’m not too sure. I think 
it’s because you’re alive. You 
see, life is a transient thing. 
Matter is continuous in one 
form or another. Matter ex- 
isting today always existed 
and will always exist, or 
something like that. I didn’t 
listen too carefully. Anyhow, 
it’s possible for someone to 
travel back in time but not 
ahead. Do I make myself 
clear? It’s out of my line, you 
know.” 

Julia reached down and 



scooped up Belle. “Can you 
touch her?” 

“What is that?” 

“My cat. Can you touch 
her?” 

“A cat? My, the anatomists 
would love to see that! But 
it’s the same as with you. My 
hand passes right through 
her.” 

Julia put Belle back on the 
floor. Her mind was racing. 

Vassi said, “She’s sitting 
right where I’m standing.” 

“I’ve got to believe it’s not 
a nightmare. I’ve got to be- 
lieve you’re real and that you 
can help me.” 

“If I can do it quickly. I 
have so much else to do. Oth- 
ers are waiting to use the 
machine.”

“Are people well where you 
come from?” 

“Very well, thank you.” 
“Are there any incurable 
diseases?” She tried to listen 
for his breathing. 

“Incurable? You mean sick- 
ness that doesn’t respond to 
treatment? No, of course 
not.” 

“Then take me with you!” 
she cried. 

“You just said you wanted 
to guide me here.” 

“Take me with you to your 
time.” 

“I can’t do that. I can’t 
even touch you.” 

“There must be a way. You 
have got to think of some- 
thing.” 

“Even if I could take you. 
I’m not supposed to.” 

“Why?” 

“It would mix up history to 
remove persons from their 
time. It might even be dan- 
gerous with artifacts. I sup- 
pose we couldn’t hold onto 
them very long.” 

“History? I have no his- 
tory. I’m going to die very 
soon. No one depends on me. 
I have no one. Please take me, 
Vassi.” 

“I feel very strange.” 

“Are you all right?” 

“Yes. I just feel — odd.” 
“How . .” 

“First you want to guide 
me, then you want to come 
with me, you don’t care about 
mankind’s survival. You 
sound so terrified and con- 
fused.” 



J ULIA sank down on the 
couch. If only she could 
see him. “Don’t leave me to 
die.” 

“How strange to talk about 
dying,” said Vassi. “We all 
live so long we never think 
about it.” 

“You will take me with 
you, Vassi?” 

“If people in your time 
have such short lives, then 
why does dying trouble you? 
It would seem a matter of 
course.” 

“Vassi, I haven’t lived yet.” 
“This is out of my line. I’ll 
tell you what. When I return. 
I’ll talk to one of the scien- 
tists. If they’re interested in 
the project, they’ll send some- 
one back.” 

“How long will that be?” 
“Now let’s see if I can fig- 
ure in your time. Hmm . 
I’d say about a year . .” 

Julia closed her eyes. She 
felt dampness under the lids. 
Her voice was hollow as she 
spoke to the empty room. 
“I’ll be dead in six months.” 
And the voice in her head 
echoed, “Six months . .” 
“Vassi, isn’t there someone 
you can talk to now?” 

He didn’t answer her. 

Julia looked around the 
room. “Vassi, are you still 
here? Vassi? Vassi, if you 
don’t talk, I can’t tell if you’re 
still here! Vassi, please an- 
swer me. Did I talk too much? 
I didn’t mean to run on about 
my problems. I know you 
have a job to do. Maybe you 

69 



VASSI 




can squeeze me in. I don’t 
want to keep you from your 
work. Vassi, you didn’t go, 
did you? You didn’t leave me! 
Don’t leave. I believe in you. 
I believe in you . .” 

And now she had the alone- 
ness she had longed for. He 
was gone and she would be 
left with the Mrs. Schultzes 
and the doctor. 

She went from the living 
room to the kitchen to the 
bathroom and back into the 
living room, listening, hoping 
to catch the small sound of 
his breathing. But her body 
would not be quiet and she 
heard nothing except herself. 

She stood for a long while 
looking down at the bed. The 
sunlight drifted from the pil- 
low onto the covers and final- 
ly spilled oflf the foot of the 
bed onto the floor and the 
room was a shade darker. She 
was a stone, but a stone whose 
blood gurgled and stomach 
rumbled and heart beat and 
pulse pounded, so loudly she 
could hear nothing else. 

Her legs gave way and she 
crumpled to the bed and she 
was silent at last. 

The breathing came from 
the direction of the window. 

She spoke into the covers. 
“Vassi, why didn’t you an- 
swer me?” 

“You tempt me and I have 
so much to do, so much 
ground to cover.” 

“You can come back.” 

“We haven’t got enough of 
these time centers. There’s 

70 



quite a lineup to use them. If 
I go now, there’s no telling 
how long it’ll take me to get 
back.” 

Julia got up and went to 
the window. “Am I facing 
you?” 

“Yes.” 

“You’re my only hope, wild 
as it seems. Vss&i, wouldn’t it 
be helpful to your research to 
have a real live person from 
my time to study?” 

V ASSI spoke slowly. “You 
mean you would be will- 
ing to have us — study you?” 
“Within limits . No, not 
within limits.” 

“They’ll be very angry if 
I come back without my re- 
search project.” 

“Are people that cold in 
your time?” asked Julia. 

“Cold?” Vassi repeated in 
bewilderment. 

“Hpftrtlpq*??” 

“Heartless? I hardly think 
so.” 

“I mean callous, without 
pity, without compassion.” 
“I’ve been very busy. I 
haven’t thought about it.” 
“Do men and women marry 
in your time?” 

“Yes, they do.” 

“Are you married?” 

“No, you see. I’m not very 
— presentable. Besides, I have 
my research.” 

“To me you’re the most 
beautiful man in the world.” 
“You can’t see me. If you 
saw me, you wouldn’t think 



ART LEWIS 




“I can hear you. That’s all 
I need.” 

Julia turned from the win- 
dow and walked back to the 
couch. When she sat down she 
could feel herself trembling. 
Never, never in her life had 
she spoken to a man like that. 
Maybe, if she could see him, 
his eyes would be mocking 
her. 

She said, “If you take me 
back with you, then later 
when I’m well I could come 
back with you and show you 
everything you would want to 
see. Then I could be your 
guide.” 

He was standing in front 
of her. She could hear him 
breathing again. There was 
excitement in his breathing; 
she was sure of it. 

He said, “I wish 1 could 
touch you. You’re very beau- 
tiful.” 

“Vassi, in my own time I’m 
ugly. Perhaps I belong in 
your time.” 

Then the excitement that 
was in his breathing was in 
his voice. “All right. All 
right. I’ll see what I can do. 
You wait right here. It may 
take me several years to get 
back. But I’ll do it if I 
can . .” 

“Several years! Vassi, I 
can’t wait that long !” She was 
very near despair. 

“No, no, you don’t under- 
stand. In your time it’ll only 
be a matter of minutes. The 
controls would be set to right 
now, however long it may 

VASSI 



take to nave the project ap- 
proved in my time.” 

The room was quiet. A 
slight breeze drifted in 
through the open window. 
Julia sat very still on the. 
couch for a few moments. 
Belle rubbed herself against 
the coffee table and then 
climbed into Julia’s lap. 

She had to hold on. She had 
to believe. A world with no 
illness. A world where people 
live practically forever. A 
world with Vassi. 

She scratched the cat be- 
hind the ears. Belle started to 
purr softly. 

“Belle,” Julia said, “what 
am I going to do with you? 
Vassi will think of something. 
He’s coming back. Belle. He’s 
coming back and he’ll take 
both of us with him.” 

She picked up the cat and 
put it on the couch. Then she 
got up and went to the mirror 
over the dresser. She pushed 
her hair back from her face. 

He said I was beautiful. 
Not even my mother ever said 
I was beautiful. What will 
they think at the office when 
I don’t come in tomorrow or 
even phene? They won’t think 
anything. They’ll get Sheila 
with the black hair and the 
big bust to do my work and 
they won’t think about me at 
all. 

Even that one didn’t say I 
was beautiful. Not even right 
after I moved in here and he 
was a little drunk, and he 
could have said it then. Then, 

71 




of all times, but he didn’t. He 
just looked a little ashamed, 
maybe disgusted afterward, 
and he talked about being late 
for a dinner appointment. 

T here was a knock on the 
door. Julia whirled from 
the mirror. Vassi must have 
gotten a little off course. She 
hadn’t thought of that possi- 
bility. She walked quickly to 
the door. 

“Vassi?" she asked. 

“It’s me, Mrs. Shultz.” 
“What do you want?’’ 
“You went to the doctor 
today. I expected you’d come 
by. Tell me, how are you?” 
“Go away.” 

“Julia, open up. Maybe I 
can do something for you.” 
“Go away. Please go away.” 
“You’re not feeling so 
well?” 

“No.” 

'‘Bad news, maybe?” 

“I don’t want to see anyone. 
Mrs. Shultz.” 

“I understand. I’ll come 
back later.” 

Footsteps went down the 
hallway. A door opened. The 
sound of a television set. A 
door closed. 

Vassi, hurry! I don’t know 
whether or not it really hap- 
pened. I’m not sure now, 
Vassi. I am going out of my 
mind. I am clutching at 
straws. Come back, Vassi. 
Come back. Reassure me. 
“They said it would work.” 
“Vassi!” 

“They said it would work, 
72 



but it sounds like a terrible 
risk. We’ll do it with the cat 
first.” 

“Vassi, where are you?” 
“Right in front of you. Now 
listen carefully.” 

“Are you going to take me 
with you?” 

“We’ll try the cat first. If it 
works with the cat, then we’ll 
try you.” 

Julia was trembling. “What 
do I do?” 

“The first thing we have to 
do is kill the cat.” 

“What are you talking 
about!” 

“When the cat is dead, it 
will become as inanimate an 
object as any of those books 
over there. In that state I 
should ’le able to transport it 
to my time. There the doctors 
will revive it. Everything is 
ready.” 

“r can’t kill my cat!” 

“If it works, it’s only tem- 
porary.” 

“And if it doesn’t work?” 
she whispered. 

“I’d rather it be the cat 
than you.” 

“I never dreamed . 

“We’ll have to hurry. They 
are waiting.” 

“I can’t kill Belle.” 

“You’re not killing her. 
You’re transporting her.” 
The tears were in Julia’s 
eyes again. “It’s crazy. I’m 
crazy.” 

“Look, I’d do it, but I can’t 
physically touch the cat.” 

“I know. I know.” 

“They said suffocation was 

ART LEWIS 




best. It leaves fewer compli- 
cations.” 

J ULIA bent down and pick- 
ed up the cat. Her tears 
fell on the animal’s fur. She 
held it close to her. The cat 
was quiet, unknowing. 

Julia said, “Do me first.” 
“Even if I could, I would 
not,” said Vassi. “The cat 
first.” 

“I’ve had her since she was 
a kitten, a little round ball 
with a button for a nose. I 
can’t do this to her. If it does 
not work . This is my mad- 
ness, not hers!” 

“What were you going to 
do with her six months from 
now?” 

“Six months . Alone, she 
would be left alone . Belle 
has never been alone except 
for the hours when I’m at 
work. Who would take care 
of her? She’s such a fussy 
eater. I have to feed her liver 
from my hand . .” 

“You’ll be together.” 
“Together . .” 

“Take one of the pillows on 
the bed. Don’t think about it! 
Do it!” 

Julia carried Belle over to 
the bed. As she tried to put 
it down, one of its claws be- 
came entangled in her dress. 
The cat started to struggle as 
if finally awakened. Julia 
reached over for a pillow. 
Sweat stood out on her fore- 
head. Her tears blinded her. 
She saw the mass of fur. She 
saw the softness. The claws 

YASSI 



were freed. She brought the 
pillow down over Belle. 

Julia blacked out, sprawled 
across the pillow. 

She couldn’t have been out 
long. She pulled herself from 
the bed. 'The pillow was on 
the floor. Belle was gone. 

Vassi’s voice, was in her 
head. “It worked! The anato- 
mists are wild ! I’ve never 
seen so much excitement!” 

“Belle is all right?” 

“Wonderful. It took them 
no time at all to revive her. 
The laboratory is a bedlam. 
Everyone wants to examine 
her.” 

“How should I do it? I’ll 
never be able to suffocate my- 
self.” She laughed a little. “I 
can’t even turn on the gas 
range. Mine is electric.” 

She looked around the 
apartment. If she slashed her 
wrists there would be too 
much blood. She hated blood. 
The thought of poison repell- 
ed her. Wait— she had it. 

She pulled one of the sheets 
off the bed and twisted it. She 
pushed the overstuffed chair 
into the center of the room 
and stood on one of the arms 
to attach an end of the sheet 
to the ceiling fixture. At the 
other end she made a noose. 

There was a knock on the 
door again. 

“Julia, if you’re not well, 
it’s no good you should be 
alone,” Mrs. Schultz said. 

Julia slipped the noose over 
her head. 

“Vassi, do you love me?” 

73 




“Of course. I just hope 
you’ll love me.” 

Mrs. Schultz knocked hard. 
“Julia, I hear you talking. I 
know you’re home. Let me in. 
I have some soup for you.” 
“Vassi, do you think I’m 
beautiful?” 

“The most beautiful woman 
I have ever seen.” 

Mrs. Schultz pounded on 
the door. “Julia, why don’t 
you answer me?” 

As Julia stepped off the 
arm of the chair, she saw the 
open window. A thought 
crossed her mind before the 
noose tightened. Belle could 
have jumped out of the win- 
dow when I passed out. Julia, 
you’re a realist! 

M rs. SHULTZ put down 
the pot of soup and open- 
ed the door. 

The apartment is called a 
single. It consists of a 
Murphy bed, a chest of draw- 
ers, an overstuffed chair, a 
sofa, a coffee table, a seven- 
teen-inch television set, a 
bookcase partially filled with 
the volumes A through F of 
an encyclopedia from the su- 
permarket, and assorted pa- 
perback books, and a radio 
that doesn’t work. In the ceil- 
ing is a fixture with two 
twenty-five-watt bulbs. From 
the fixture hangs a twisted 
sheet with a hangman’s knot 
in the end of it. The noose is 
quite empty. So is the apart- 
ment. END

Somewhere on Mars there had to be a 
meeting of the minds . , 



1 IEUTENANT Lloyd spot- 
A ted the first alien in the 
ruins of the strange red Mar- 
tian city on the second day of 
exploration. His first impulse 
was to call out to the other 
men — but then, afraid his 
voice would startle the crea- 
ture down at the end of the 
rubble-strewn street, he si- 
lently unholstered his mili- 
tary service pistol and crept 
forward toward the back (he 
hoped it was the back) of the 
alien, his breath rasping be- 
hind his faceplate. 



He was a mere ten paces 
short of his goal when loose 
gravel beneath his heavy boot 
betrayed him. Even in the 
thin Martian atmosphere, the 
sound was a sharp one. The 
creature spun about, one ap- 
pendage gripping the haft of 
a slim crystal tube. He froze 
there, watching Lloyd with 
odd oval-shaped eyes, yellow- 
orange in color. Lloyd’s thumb 
slid back the safety catch on 
his automatic, slowly, care- 
fully. 

Then the creature lowered 

75 




the tube and its wide lipless 
mouth curled in what had to 
be a grin. “Ookl okkl?” it said 
distinctly. 

Lloyd looked into the alien 
eyes and was pleased to see 
the intelligence within their 
depths. He reholstered his 
pistol and held out his hand. 
“Lieutenant Lloyd of the 
Sherlock 11“ he said. 

The alien hesitated, then 
inserted the four flaccid stalk- 
things at the end of its “arm” 
into Lloyd’s hand. They shook 
these clasped appendages sol- 
emnly, then withdrew their 
own with relief. 

“Boy, am I glad you Mar- 
tians are friendly!” Lloyd 
laughed. “When I saw you up 
the street, I envisioned a full- 
scale guerrilla attack and — 
Damn, you’re not getting a 
word of this, are you?” 

In reply, the creature point- 
ed to its thoracic region and 
said, “Ulkay Blet.” It pointed 
to Lloyd again and enunciat- 
ed carefully, “Lieutenant 
Lloyd.” 

“Glad to know you, Ulkay. 
Or do I call you by both 
names? Or just Mister Blet?” 

“Ulkay,” the alien said. 
“Blet,” he added. “Ulkay 
Blet,” he clarified, with an al- 
most Earthlike shrug. 

I T WAS strictly a take-your- 
pick name, Lloyd saw He 
took his pick. “Ulkay, tell me, 
are you the last of your race, 
or are there others of your 
kind atill left alive on Mars?” 



Ulkay just stared, friendly 
but lust. 

Lloyd tried again. “I — ” he 
pointed to himself — “am here 
with more like me — ” he 
pointed to himself, held up 
one finger to Ulkay, then 
pointed in a long sweep be- 
hind himself toward the end 
of the street and held up four 
fingers. His only success was 
an envious look from Ulkay at 
Lloyd’s extra finger. 

“Hoo boy!” said Lloyd, 
smacking his brow in cha- 
grin. “This is a rough one. 
Look, Ulkay, you hold on and 
don’t be scared.” He laid a 
hand upon Ulkay’s shoulder 
ft)r assurance, then turned his 
head and shouted, “Here/ 
This way, men!’* 

The sound of heavy booted 
feet began, far up the clut- 
tered street. Lloyd felt Ulkay 
grow tense. “It’s all right,” he 
said slowly, soothingly, as one 
talks to a horse or dog, know- 
ing the tone conveys v/hat the 
words cannot- Ulkay seemed 
to sense the assurance and re- 
laxed a little. 

In another minute. Kroner, 
Harrison, Tandy and Craig 
were beside their command- 
ing officer, gaping with un- 
concealed glee at the slightly 
under five-foot form of Ulkay, 
who stared right back, steadi- 
ly if not boldly. 

“Our first contact with a 
Martian !” Kroner exulted, 
his voice metallic through the 
oxygen helmet. 

“Does he talk?” Harrison

wanted to know immediately. 

“Where are his friends?” 
asked Tandy, frowning. 

Craig, unable to think of a 
question, was silent. But it 
was to Craig that Lloyd ad- 
dressed his first statement. 
“He speaks a language. His 
name is Ulkay Bret. Think 
you can rig a written or oral 
Rosetta Stone for us, Craig?” 
Craig shuffled his feet bash- 
fully. “I can try.” 

“Is he alone, though?” said 
Tandy, irked that his ques- 
tion had gone unanswered. 
“His buddies might be around 
here waiting to pick us off. 
This is their city, after all, 
and we’re trespassers.” 

Lloyd shook his head du- 
biously. “I think you’re 
wrong, Tandy. Ulkay’s got 
some sort of weapon with him 
and he put it away without 
trying to use it. If there are 
others, they’re probably intel- 
ligent and friendly, too.” 
“Unless I’m mistaken,” 
Kroner remarked dryly, 
“we’re about to put your 
statement to the test.” 

“What—?” said Lloyd, and 
looked where Kroner was now 
facing. 

Seven creatures like Ulkay 
were on their way toward the 
group, each bearing one of 
those long crystal rods. At 
first glance, they all looked 
alike to Lloyd. Then, as they 
drew nearer, he saw that they 
were as different from one 
another as he from his own 
men. 



“Ulkay,” he said softly, 
“would you tell your friends 
that we’re their friends ? They 
look kind of trigger-happy 
and . .” 

Ulkay, catching Lloyd’s 
meaning from the way he 
looked toward the approach- 
ing squad, turned and bab- 
bled something at them. They 
hesitated. Then all put their 
crystal rods into short scab- 
bards hanging from their 
belts. 

B ehind him, Lloyd heard 
Tandy’s sigh of relief. He 
turned to Craig. “You and 
Ulkay see if you can set up 
something to bridge the lan- 
guage barrier, while Kroner 
and I go back to the ship and 
radio the news back to 
Earth.” 

“Okay,” said Craig. He was 
the expedition’s linguist, but 
extremely shy, considering he 
was the liaison man with any 
aliens they encountered- “I’ll 
start them with numbers ; 
that’s usually a good kicking- 
off place, and then I can work 
into body parts, relationships, 
and — ” 

“Whoa,” said Lloyd. Craig 
could be talkative on his pro- 
fessional topics. “I don’t want 
the details, just some results. 
Kroner and I should be back 
in about an hour. I’ll talk with 
Ulkay then, if you can show 
me how to reach him.” 

He and Kroner strode off to 
their ship, set onto the cold 
red sands a mile away. 



THE CONTACT POINT 



77 




It would take nearly three 
minutes for a message to 
reach Earth, and another 
three, at least, before the re- 
ply came back, so Lloyd, dis- 
pensing with formality, sent, 
“This is Lieutenant Lloyd of 
the Sherlock II. We have 
landed successfully on Mars, 
discovered a decaying Mar- 
tian city, and eight inhabi- 
tants, so far. If you read me, 
set up a recorder and signal 
me when you are ready to tape 
my report.” 

He sat back in the chair 
with a sigh. “There, that cuts 
out a lot of fuss,” he remarked 
to Kroner. 

“And the less time spent 
away from our men, the 
Kptter 

“Yes,” said Lloyd. “How 
does this thing — well, how 
does it feel to you?” 

“Too easy,” said Kroner 
without hesitation. “Of 
course, there’s no reason why 
it should feel at all hard, is 
there?” 

“No,” Lloyd admitted re- 
luctantly. “No reason at all 
why we shouldn’t establish 
contact with these Martians, 
find them friendly, get our in- 
formation about their city, 
way of life, and so on, and go 
back safely to Earth and 
home. But — ” 

“Yeah,” said Kroner. 

“ 'Butr ” 

“They act friendly.” 

“Maybe that’s all it is, an 
act. But if they’re not going 
to be chums, why go to all this 

78 



trouble? You know what I 
mean, sir?” 

Lloyd leaned back in the 
padded chair and scratched 
his short-cropped head. 
“Beats me. And yet I can’t 
help feeling uncomfortable 
about — There’s the blinker. 
Earth’s ready to record.” He 
dropped the conversation and 
set himself to telling Earth 
of developments so far. 

"TS it some sort of taboo or 
J. what?” Lloyd demanded 
irritably of Craig. It was 
three hours since he and Kro- 
ner had returned from the 
ship, and communication with 
Ulkay and his bunch had 
been established — but with 
one annoying and unexpected 
feature. 

“I can’t seem to find out, 
sir,” Craig said miserably. 
“He’s responsive on almost 
every other topic, but when I 
ask him about the city here, 
he says he can’t tell me. I’ve 
asked him why, but his an- 
swer escapes me.” 

“When he says he ‘can’t’ 
tell you, does he mean he is 
physically unable to, or for- 
bidden to?” 

“I’m not even sure if it’s 
‘can’t.’ It might just be 
‘won’t.’ But I am sure it’s a 
negative of some sort. They 
shake their heads and nod 
same as we do for yes and no.” 

“Let’s see that list,” Lloyd 
said, his voice tired. 

Craig held it out, but Kro- 
ner took it. “You’ve looked at 



JACK SHARKEY 




it ten times in the past hour, 
sir,” he apologized. “Let me 
have a whack at it.” 

Lloyd started to argue the 
point, then gave it up. “Okay, 
Sergeant. See what you can 
make of it. If you can ask a 
clear question of Ulkay and 
Company with those choice 
bits of language. I’ll put in 
your name for a decoration.” 
Kroner scanned the list, 
noting with fading hope the 
vocabulary he had to work 
with. “Wish we had more 
verbs!” he said. 

“They’re the hardest, al- 
ways,” said Craig. “Active 
ones are easy enough, though 
the tenses and irregularities 
can be tough, but the non- 
active — the intransitive — 
can’t be demonstrated the 
way actions and things can.” 
“Well, we’ve got Mars, and 
city, and — ^that’s a good one 
— men. That’s them?” 

Craig nodded. 

“Hey, weren’t there eight 
of those guys a while back? 
We’re two short!” 

“What?” said Lloyd, look- 
ing over at the aliens. “You’re 
right. Kroner! Ulkay’s gone, 
and — ^let me see — that heavy- 
set one with the big shoulder- 
span. Where the hell — ?” 
Tandy and Harrison came 
up at that moment. 

“Sir,” Tandy looked dis- 
gusted, “we can’t find out a 
thing from the rubble. No 
heavy radiation present, so it 
kind of discounts an atomic 
war, although — ” 



“Never mind the surmises 
for now,” said Lloyd. “Tell 
me just what you know for 
sure.” 

One side of Tandy’s mouth 
twisted. “Yes, sir. Very little 
of the rubble seems to be due 
to any heavy damage. I mean, 
no buildings have collapsed or 
anything like that. It’s just as 
though time had crumbled off 
a brick hole here and there, 
and nobody bothered sweep- 
ing the street.” 

“The city gates were 
knocked down,” Lloyd pro- 
tested. 

T andy shook his head. 

“Not knocked down, sir — 
fallen. It’s my opinion this 
place is just obsolete, a sort of 
last-year's model that needs a 
new coat of paint and an en- 
gine overhaul. Except for all 
the dust, sand and crumbled 
material, it’s in pretty good 
shape.” 

“You mean it’s unfashion- 
able but serviceable?” said 
Kroner. -“Like a spring-driven 
phonograph?” 

“That’s about it. Sergeant,” 
Tandy nodded. “Anything 
else, you’re going to have to 
ask the Martians them- 
selves.” 

“Which brings me back to 
my earlier apprehension,” 
said Kroner. “I don’t like the 
idea of two of those guys be- 
ing missing- Hold on — ^there 
they come! And with a small 
cannon, unless I miss my 
guess I” 



THE CONTACT POINT 



79 




The Earthmen were all on 
their feet now, facing the pair 
of aliens who lugged a heavy 
contraption with a tubular 
nozzle on the front of it up 
the street toward the waiting 
group. 

“It can’t be a cannon,” said 
Lloyd, puzzled. “Why would 
they bother, when hand- 
weapons would do?” 

By that time, Ulkay and 
his crony had the gadget set 
down on a tripod base and 
were turning dials on its side. 
The Earthmen, every one of 
them, loosened pistols in their 
holsters, but only Tandy ac- 
tually brought his out. 

Then they jumped as a me- 
tallic voice came out through 
the gadget’s nozzle. “Men!” 
said the voice. “Do not possess 
fear.” 

“A miracle!” gasped Craig. 
“It’s a translating machine!” 
He rushed forward to view 
this thing, his face glowing 
with delight. 

Lloyd, recovering from his 
start, saw that Ulkay was 
speaking into a tube at the 
side of the machine, and real- 
ized that his translated voice 
had been the one heard. 

“Ulkay,” he said, going to- 
ward the machine, “does this 
work both ways?” 

Ulkay nodded and pointed 
to the nozzle on the front. 
“This,” said his voice from the 
nozzle, “picks up as well as 
recepts.” 

“Receives," said Craig au- 
tomatically. 

80 



“ — ^as receives,” said the 
nozzle automatically. “There 
will exist some few ungram- 
matics, but it will mostly make 
sensible.” 

“Man, this simplifies every- 
thing !” Lloyd exclaimed. “Ul- 
kay, do you mind if we ask 
you some questions?” 

Ulkay, via the nozzle, re- 
plied with dignity, “You and 
your Craig have questioned 
with relentless of us. Can we 
be allowed the similar luck?” 
“I beg your pardon,” Lloyd 
said sincerely. “Go ahead and 
ask.” 

“These transparents you 
wear upon your faces, why?” 
asked the nozzle, in a mechan- 
ical monotone. 

“The air.” Lloyd gestured 
with a sweep of his arm. “It 
is too thin to support our kind 
of life without these masks.” 
“Strange,” said the nozzle. 
“And where are your wom- 
en?” 

“We did not bring them 
with us,” said Lloyd. “We 
made this trip strictly to find 
you.” 

Ulkay stared at Lloyd a 
long moment. Then the nozzle 
asked, “What trip?” 

“To your city,” said Lloyd. 
“To your planet.” 

U LKAY frowned, then fid- 
dled a moment with a 
dial on the side of the ma- 
chine. The nozzle spoke slow- 
ly this time. “Repeat your 
re.sponse. It was not a sensi- 
ble.” 



JACK SHARKEY 




“We came here. To Mars. 
To find you.” Lloyd said it 
carefully and distinctly, feel- 
ing very uneasy. 

“But this is Earth,” said 
the nozzle loudly- 

“To you it is Earth,” said 
Lloyd, with a tolerant smile. 
“I think we're having a se- 
mantic problem, Ulkay. Each 
planet’s self-name would 
translate as ‘Earth.’ This ma- 
chine cannot make the proper 
distinction.” 

“No, no, no !” came the noz- 
zle’s voice. “You say your 
planet is called ‘Earth’. Why 
do you now call it ‘Mars’?” 
“We don’t,” said Lloyd, be- 
wildered. “We call this plan- 
et Mars. Our planet is called 
Earth—” 

“Sir!” Kroner grasped his 
arm tightly. “Wait a minute! 
I think I get it! . Ulkay! 
Is this your planet?” 

“No,” said the nozzle. “Is it 
not yours?" 

“Numbers!” said Craig. 
“Ask him by the number of 
the planet from the sun.” 
“We are from Earth, the 
third planet from the sun,” 
said Lloyd, holding up +hree 
fingers for emphasis. “Where 
are you from?” 

“We are from Earth.” said 
the nozzle, “the second planet 
from the sun.” Ulkay held up 
two digits- 

“Venusians?” Tandy 
squawked, while Harrison 
doubled up in a fit of laughter 
as the idea sank in. In anoth- 
er moment, both groups — Ul- 

THE CONTACT POINT 



hay's and Lloyd’s— had joined 
him in a tension-breaking 
paroxysm of mirth. 

“Where are you parked?” 
asked Kroner, the first to re- 
cover some semblance of con- 
trol. 

Ulkay, still chuckling, 
pointed in the opposite direc- 
tion to that in which the Sfeer- 
lock II was standing. “Out- 
side the west gate of the city,” 
said the nozzle. “Where are 
you?” 

“Outside the east gate. We 
thought you were Martians — 
people of this, the fourth plan- 
et.” 

“And we in turn thought 
you were Martians,” said Ul- 
kay, through the nozzle. There 
was more laughter in both 
groups. 

“For Pete's sake!” mut- 
tered Lloyd. “For Pete’s sake ! 
Look, Ulkay, why don’t both 
our groups get some rest and 
we’ll make our inspection 
tour of the city tomorrow, the 
two groups together?” 

Ulkay, after a babble of 
discussion with his men, was 
in agreement with this plan, 
and they and the Earthmen 
shared a large room within 
one of the old abandoned 
buildings. 

“Will your air supply not 
run out?” Ulkay queried. 

“Not on these,” Lloyd ex- 
plained. “They’re not tank 
masks ; they’re compression 
masks. A hydraulic system in- 
side the suit keeps a compres- 
sor running in this gadget on 

81 




our backs, as long as we're 
moving about. Martian air is 
thin but non-poisonous." 

“But if you sleep?" 

“The air runs low, which 
makes us fidget, which pumps 
more air through the com- 
pressors," Lloyd explained. 

Ulkay expressed admira- 
tion at the cleverness of Earth 
scientists, and then joined his 
toien in slumber. The Earth- 
men, tired and happy, fell 
soundly asleep. 

TT was still dark, the chill 

purple dark of Mars at 
night, when Lloyd awakened 
abruptly. His body was tense 
and his mind keenly alert. 
Something was wrong. He 
felt it, but couldn't place the 
source of his uneasiness. 

He sat up and looked about 
him. Starlight, coming in 
bright pinpoints through a 
high arched window, glinted 
reassuringly off the helmets 
of his men, lying in pools of 
deep shadow all about him. 
He looked for Ulkaj^ and his 
group, and saw their smaller 
silhouettes huddled on the 
stone flooring. Feeling a little 
better, he lay down once more 
and tried to fall back to sleep. 
But there was a gnawing, nag- 
ging something in his mind 
that would not allow sleep to 
come. 

“What's bothering me ?" he 
asked himself. “Is it some- 
thing about Ulkay and his 
bunch? The only really odd 
thing about them is that they 

82 



don't wear any breathing 
equipment in this thin air, 
right? And didn't Ulkay ex- 
plain that the atmosphere on 
Venus is just as thin? It did- 
n't jibe with Harrison's opin- 
ion about atmospheres, but 
Harrison hasn't actually been 
to Venus, after all, and the 
cloudiness still keeps its at- 
mosphere a secret from 
Earth's spectroscopes, right?" 

His mind assured him that 
this was right and he felt a 
little better, but not much. 

“So what's eating me? A 
hunch? Intuition? Or just 
alien-planet nerves?" he went 
on. “Why should I wake up in 
the middle of the night feel- 
ing scared ? Aren't my men all 
present and accounted for? 
Aren't they sleeping quietly, 
just as they should be?" 

Feeling annoyed with his 
own nebulous fears, Lloyd sat 
up again and looked over the 
groups, Ulkay's and his own. 
As he watched. Kroner grunt- 
ed in his sleep and rolled over. 
Tandy's helmet emitted gen- 
tle snoring noises. Harrison 
and Craig lay more quietly, 
but their chests could be seen, 
even in that dim light, rising 
and falling normally. Lloyd 
excoriated his imagination 
for worrying him — it had fed 
him a quick suggestion that 
perhaps his companions' 
masks had been slit, suffocat- 
ing them silently to death. 

“I must trust Ulkay; it's 
necessary," said Lloyd to him- 
self. “I can't let these ground- 

JACK SHARKEY 




less fears spoil future rela- 
tions between Earth and Ve- 
nus. The Venusians are 
friendly and intelligent, and 
not really odd-looking, once 
you discount the number of 
digits on their hands and a 
few unearthly color schemes 
on their torsos. So what am I 
scared of?” 

Cold touched his spine, 
shocking him into alertness, 
as he isolated his fear. He 
rolled over and shook Kroner 
awake with barbaric callous- 

H0SS. 

“Huh? Wha?” said Kroner, 
sitting up. 

“Sergeant,” said Lloyd, 
trying to confide his fear to 
the other man, “when we got 
here, we were nervous about 
making contact with aliens, 
right?” 

“Yeah,” Kroner said sleep- 
ily. “But it turned out okay, 
sir, didn’t it?” He shook h'S 
groggy head. “I mean, Ulkay 
and his bunch are okay, are- 
n’t they?” 

“Yeah,” said Lloyd shakily. 
"They are fine — but. Kroner, 
they’re not the right aliens!” 

It took Kroner a moment to 
get it. When he did, he came 
awake with a jolt. “And we 
haven’t even posted a guard !” 

Lloyd, his worries abetted 
by Kroner’s response, got to 
his feet, shouting, "Mayday! 
Mayday!" 



His men — ^and Ulkay’s a 
few seconds later — were up, 
everybody snapping on porta- 
ble torches and setting the 
chamber alive with fiashing 
lights. 

“Ulkay!” Lloyd said, rush- 
ing to the Venusian. “If 
you’re not the Martians, and 
we’re not the Martians, then 
there is still a chance that 
someone else is the Martians !” 

Ulkay yelled something to 
his men, and Lloyd watched 
with horror as each Venusian 
fumbled at an empty scab- 
bard upon his belt. Lloyd’s 
hand shot to his holster and 
found there just what his men 
were finding in their own hol- 
sters: nothing. 

“Do you think we’ve discov- 
ered the Martians?” said Kro- 
ner, his voice hoarse with 
fright. 

Then the glaring overhead 
lights of the room came on, 
revealing the surrounding 
phalanx of hard-eyed, armed 
creatures. 

“Unless I’m mistaken,” 
Lloyd said, “the Martians 
have discovered us.” 

An instant later, there was 
nothing in the center of the 
alien room but half -molten air 
compressors and the charred, 
smoking remains of a funny- 
looking little nozzle, still echo- 
ing a bilingual chorus of 
agony. end

Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



0 ”N the jacket of Venus 
Plus X (Pyramid), the 
book is called “the strangest 
science-fiction novel Theodore 
Sturgeon has ever written.” It 
is strange, all right, but Stur- 
geon has a talent for strange- 
ness. Often he has seemed to 
want to shock his readers 
with his daring. It is love that 
he writes about, in whatever 
form love may appear. 

Some of the forms repel. “I 
wrote an empathetic sort of 
tale about some homosexu- 
als,” he reminisces, in a post- 
script to Venus Plus X, “and 
my mailbox filled up with 
cards drenched with scent 
and letters written in purple 
ink with green capitals . 
You cannot be objective about 
sex, especially when it’s out- 
side certain parameters.” But 
7 can, he is sailing. 

. It is this point of view, this 
objective compassion for 
queerness - for - its - own-sake 
coupled with a godlike con- 
tempt for those who do not 
have the same warmth and 
ihe same objectivity, that has 
caused some otherwise first- 
rate Sturgeons to leave a bad 
taste in the mouth of the read- 



er. Sturgeon clearly feels that 
beauty can be found in mire. 
And it can; but not by pre- 
tending that mire is beauty. 

Then, too, Sturgeon is hip, 
and a lot of the time too hip 
for comfort. His characters 
don’t talk, they do routines. 
Venus Plus X is by no means 
free from this. Threaded 
throughout its length is a se- 
ries of gray-flannel dialogues. 
In the past this sort of thing 
has been unhelpful to his 
story. If the interludes had a 
connection, it was not always 
easy to see ; once found, it was 
not always worth the trouble. 

And now here comes Venus 
Plus X, a story set in a human 
but not a bisexual world, 
where anyone can do what, 
and with which, and to 
whom ; and, lo ! the thing 
turns out to be wonderful. It 
is not very surprising that 
Sturgeon has written an ex- 
cellent book. But it- is surely 
astonishing that he has built 
it not out of his strong points, 
but out of his weaknesses 1 

Sturgeon has something to 
tell us in Venus Plus X. He 
says it with irresistible au- 
thority. He has invented a 



84 




new, fascinating, self-consist- 
ent, exciting world and peo- 
pled it with a remarkable, 
plausible, provocative new 
species. He has put into that 
world a sympathetic, compre- 
hensible, well-intentioned hu- 
man being named Charlie 
Johns. And he has let world, 
species and human interact 
before our eyes, so that we are 
told everything we should 
know and nothing we needn’t ; 
and in the process he has 
evoked our compassion, our 
pleasure and our love. 

If there has been a better 
science-fiction novel in the 
past few years — say, since 
James Blish’s A Case of Con- 
science — this reviewer has 
not seen it. It is so good that 
it can’t be praised in detail, 
because the detail deserves to 
come to you as Sturgeon in- 
tends it, seriatim. This one 
you’ve got to read for yourself 
and don’t let anyone spoil it 
for you. 

Now, even Venus Plus X is 
not all perfection. Charlie 
Johns is the name of a real 
man — a nonce-figure of a cou- 
ple decades ago, who got to 
be a nonce-figure by marry- 
ing a nine-year-old bride. It 
is hard to escape the suspi- 
cion that Sturgeon (a man 
who seldom does anything by 
coincidence) is enjoying some 
sort of private joke in giving 
his lead character that name. 
And then the postscript 
tacked to the end of the book 
is — ^well — smart-alecky. It is 

WORLDS OF IF 



as though, having finished 
the novel and having seen for 
the first time what a really 
remarkable piece of work it 
was, the author couldn’t re- 
sist the temptation to crow. 

Well, let him crow. The 
man is entitled. 

Venus Plus X may or may 
not be the strangest science- 
fiction novel Sturgeon ever 
wrote. But it is his best. 

I N The Challenge of the Sea 
( Holt-Rinehart-Winston) , 
Arthur C. Clarke provides 
young readers with a useful 
and uniformly entertaining 
book about the world of wa- 
ter. This is not a subject that 
has previously occupied 
Clarke, except as far as the 
sea is a necessary adjunct to 
skin-diving, but he acquits 
himself with grace and merit. 
He always does. 

There are, it is true, a few 
annoying lapses. Some are 
plain slips of fact : e.g., the 
name of the most successful 
abyss-penetrating vessel is 
uniformly, but wrongly, 
spelled as “bathyscape.” 
Some are errors of omission: 
e.g., where in listing the eco- 
nomically likely ways of ex- 
tracting fresh water from the 
sea Clarke includes distilla- 
tion, ion-exchange and os- 
motic barriers, but does not 
even mention what is at pres- 
ent the chiefest contender : 
simple freezing. And some 
are in the area of opinion. 
For instance, it is possible 



85 




that, as Clarke says, farming 
ultimately “will have aban- 
doned the continents and 
moved out into the ocean.” It 
certainly is not likely. Of all 
the false hopes the anti-Mal- 
thusians have held out for 
humanity, the prospect of 
limitless food from the sea is 
surely the most illusory. Land 
plants are inherently more 
efficient than aquatic ones. 
Moreover, although it is true 
enough that there are many 
edible fish uncaught, it is al- 
so true that the total contri- 
bution of the sea to the hu- 
man diet is quite small, and 
even multiplying it many 
times cannot make it decisive. 

Nevertheless, the book’s 
merits vastly exceed its few 
faults. Clarke has been ev- 
erywhere and read every- 
thing, and his reliable talent 
for imagining the - conse-

R obert sheckley’s 

The Stahls Civilization 
(Signet) is a rarely uneven 
book, a story that makes a 
point, but reaches its goal 
only after threading the most 
remarkable maze of porten- 
tous blind alleys and scamped 

86 



explanations since Van Vogt. 

The story concerns a man. 
Will Barrent, who is exiled to 
a prison planet, his memory 
wiped away. The planet is a 
hell of topsy-turvy moral val- 
ues — “Evil is that force with- 
in us which inspires men to 
acts of strength and endur- 
ance. The worship of evil is 
. the only true worship” 
— and lethal violence: “I’m 
going to shoot you . We 
have the right to shoot down 
any new peon who leaves his 
barracks area.” “But I was- 
n’t told!” “Of course not. If 
you new men were told, none 
of you would leave your bar- 
racks area.” 

Barrent manages to sur- 
vive both the informal pot- 
shots of the citizens and 
the elaborately organized 
“Games” to which he is (in- 
evitably) subjected. He then 
tackles the central problem 
toward which the story has 
been heading, the under- 
standing and mastery of the 
Earth from which the prison- 
ers have been exiled. 

It is in this last section 
that Sheckley finds his way. 
Back on Earth, in the last 
seven of the book’s thirty 
chapters, the author pulls 
himself together and gives us 
a sharply drawn picture of a 
stagnant planet and the cul- 
ture which has made it so. 

But the bulk of the book is 
neither sharp nor convincing. 
Sheckley does not scruple to 
advance his plot by tricks, 

FREDERIK POHL 




and some of the tricks are 
dubious. The gladiatorial 
games as an ingredient of 
science fiction have become 
a cliche ; those in The Status 
Civilization are kissed off so 
briskly that they seem hard- 
ly to interest the author. The 
behavior of the book’s minor 
characters is uniformly pre- 
posterous. Those who have a 
secret go to elaborate lengths 
to advertise its existence. A 
girl from the underground 
movement (naturally there is 
an underground movement, 
nothing is spared us), who 
has gone to great trouble to 
help Barrent survive, con- 
cludes that he is worthy of 
the help she gave him because 
he did survive. (Obviously, 
this girl can’t lose. If she had 
decided not to help him, he 
would have died. This would 
have proved she was right in 
not helping him.) Barrent 
both knows everything and 
knows nothing. He has psi- 
sensed “mutants” to read the 
past and future for him, but 
their powers are oddly lim- 
ited. They can, in fact, see 
only what the author needs 
to move the story along, and 
nothing to simplify it. 

The book seems, all in all, 
to add up to a long series of 
false starts, climaxed by an 
excellent novelette which is 
more or less irrelevant to 
what has gone before. The 
“novelette” is well worth 
reading. It’s too bad about 
the false starts. 



A TIME for reminiscing 
comes to us through the 
joint efforts of Avalon and 
Ballantine. Avalon has two 
novels which seem to belong 
to an earlier age of science 
fiction, while Ballantine has 
reissu^ the short science-fic- 
tion stories of the trail-blazer 
himself under the title of 
Best Stories of H. G. Wells. 
There is not much point in a 
critical assessment of Wells, 
at this date, but there is much 
point in reading him. His 
“futures” are now often 
enough well in our past — air- 
craft and armored warfare 
are among his projections — 
but where he guessed wrong 
he was plausible, and where 
he guessed right he was un- 
canny. Moreover, the texture 
of his writing is a standing 
reproof to most of those who 
followed. 

Avalon's pair of books are 
nothing like Wells for quality, 
but they have much senti- 
mental interest for old-tim- 
ers. Actually, Next Door to 
the Sun, by Stanton A. Co- 
blentz, is not really a resur- 
rected magazine story (or, if 
it is, is one which this re- 
viewer missed.) But it has so 
much of the exact quality of 
the same writer’s Into Plu- 
tonian Depths, The Bue Bar- 
barians, After 12,000 Years 
and so on that it might just 
as well be. Coblentz is a poet 
of considerable attainments, 
and some thirty years ago 
was considered to be science- 



WORLDS OF IF 



87 




fiction’s leading satirist. Very 
few traces of either quality 
now appear. Next Door to the 
Sun takes place, of course, on 
the planet Mercury, popu- 
lated by a lost settlement of 
humans who talk with a 
Pennsylvania Dutch accent 
and live under a regimented 
society whose principal com- 
prehensible feature seems to 
be a distaste for red-haired 
men. There is some heavy- 
handed comedy, but there 
was also, at least for this re- 
viewer, enjoyment in reading. 
It may be that some of the 
enjoyment was nostalgia. 

For the same reasons Otis 
Adelbert Kline’s The Swords- 
man of Mars was pleasant to 
read. At roughly the same 
date as Coblentz’s pre-emi- 
nence, science-fiction readers 
were witnesses to one of the 
most dogged manhunts in lit- 
erary history. It seemed that 
wherever Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs sent John Carter, Otis 
Adelbert Kline’s characters 
were only inches behind. Ve- 
nus was predominantly Kline 
territory, as Mars belonged 
to Burroughs, but both exe- 
cuted many sorties on the oth- 
er’s holdings. The Swords- 
man of Mars was one of the 
sorties. It has exactly the 
merits of the Burroughs Mars 
books — excitement and a sure 
victory of good over evil — 
and exactly the faults. 

AVALON has also a brace 
of L. Sprague de Camp 

88 



novels: Solomon's Stone and 
The Glory That Was. 

Solomon's Stone is a dream- 
world fantasy ; the author 
proposes that men and wom- 
en imagine themselves to be 
different than they are, and 
that these imagined charac- 
ters have fiesh and blood ex- 
istence on another level of re- 
ality. The story concerns a 
man who incautiously tam- 
pers with a demon and is 
thrust into the other world 
for punishment. Fast, enter- 
taining, rather slight. 

The Glory That Was pre- 
sents a near-future world in 
which the Emperor Vasil, a 
hobbyist of enormous dimen- 
sions, has recreated ancient 
Greece, complete with Par- 
thenon and smelly drains, 
and peopled it with brain- 
washed 21st Century human 
beings hypnotically persuad- 
ed that they are Pericles, 
Kritias, etc. De Camp is al- 
ways exact in his history — 
well, maybe a little more than 
exact; “pedantic” suggests it- 
self as a possible term some- 
times — and his recreations of 
the past are first-rate. Still, 
the book has the air of an au- 
thor repeating himself. Lest 
Darkness Fall, an earlier and 
far better de Camp story, has 
no particular resemblance to 
this one in terms of plot; but 
the feelings of the characters, 
the conversations, the para- 
doxes are so similar that it is 
impossible to think of the one 
book without thinking of the

PHYLLIS GOTLIEB 



He was a boy. He never could be a man. 
He could only help them — and love 
them — and flee from them — 






B ENNO was sitting in the 
closet with the door closed. 
It was dark and stuffy, 
and the toe of a shoe was 
digging into the base of his 
spine, but he liked the close- 
ness. He had been grown in 



a tank as narrow as this 
closet, in dark, warm liquids. 
He had no real memory of 
that time, but he closed his 
eyes and imagined that he 
could remember the warmth, 
and the love and kindness that 




seemed to be around him 
then . 

There was a thump and a 
yell of laughter, and he 
blinked. Poppy and her ball. 
Well, she had nothing to wor- 
ry about. He had been playing 
with her a few moments ago. 
He would throw the ball and 
she would miss it and run af- 
ter it shrieking. 

“Come on, Benno, throw it, 
Benno!” and Benno threw it, 
mouth drawn in the thin, 
ironical line that served him 
for a smile. 

Finally, running to catch it, 
she overreached herself and 
fell. She sat there a minute, 
lower lip shoved out and 
mouth drawn down at the cor- 
ners into a deep inverted U 
before it opened into a howl. 

“No, no. Poppy. Don’t cry, 
lovey,” said Benno, pulling 
her up as Mrs. Peretto ran in- 
to the room. 

“Benno, what did you — ” 
She bit off the words and 
turned to the child. “Tell 
Mummy what happened, 
sweetie.” 

Benno said quietly, “Mrs. 
Peretto, why don’t you ask 
Poppy what I did to her?” 

The woman whipped 
around and he saw that she 
was trembling. She loosened 
her hold on the little girl and 
stood up. 

“Benno, I — I don’t know 
what’s got into you. You never 
used to be like this. You used 
to call me Mom — ” Abruptly 
she went out of the room. 



But she had left the child 
behind — afraid to let me know 
she doesn’t trust me — and 
Poppy trotted up to Benno and 
yanked on his trouser leg. 
“Come on, Benno, let’s play 
some more.” 

“No more for now. Poppy.” 
Benno gently pulled away 
from the sticky fingers. “Go 
find your Mummy.” 

So he went and sat down in 
the closet with the door shut 
and brooded. He would have 
enjoyed one of Wenslow’s ci- 
gars now, but the closet was 
no place to smoke it. Anyway, 
this was no good. But as he 
was about to rise he heard a 
different sound: Mrs Peretto 
dialling on the intercom. He 
stayed still. 

“Helen? Oh — ^fine, I guess. 
Nothing new really, but — I’ve 
been having a bit of trouble 
too. Thing is, I can’t even say 
it’s anything I haven’t made 
up in my own mind. But I’m 
beginning to be a little fright- 
ened. .” 

Benno waited for a while to 
be sure she had gone. For her 
to know he skulked in closets 
when he felt moody wouldn’t 
have helped at all. As he 
opened the door, he saw him- 
self in the full-length glass, 
an image of a broad stocky 
twelve-year-old boy. 

But he was five years old, 
not twelve. He had been made 
in this shape and he would die 
in it: pseudo-male and sterile, 
hairless except for the strong, 
dark line of brow and the 



GINGERBREAD BOY 



91 




close-cropped head of hair so 
black and wiry it looked arti- 
ficial. Even the temper of his 
skin was dark and sullen. 

He ran a hand over his face. 
He had been grown from a 
piece of Peretto’s flesh, so the 
features were Peretto’s; but 
Peretto was a man, and Ben- 
no a second-hand copy pre- 
tending to be his child. 

He sneered at the image 
and slipped out of the house. 

P ERETTO and Wenslow 
shared one of the shabby 
portables in Administration. 
It contained the lab where 
Benno had been born and a 
small private office, and when 
Benno reached it he was glad 
to find Peretto in and Wens- 
low out. 

Peretto looked up as he 
closed the door behind him. 
“What’s eating you, Benno?” 
“Not me,” said Benno. 
“You.” 

“I don’t think I’m giving 
you any trouble. What is it?” 
“Mrs. Peretto thinks I’ve 
got it in for Poppy, or some- 
thing. She thought I hurt her 
when she fell today.” 

Peretto shrugged. “It’s not 
unusual for parents to be wor- 
ried about jealousy problems 
between older and younger 
children.” 

Benno helped himself in 
Wenslow’s humidor and lit up. 

“She’s not worried. She’s 
frightened. I heard her saying 
so to Mrs. Metzner on the 
phone when I was sitting in 

92 



the closet thinking. She’s 
scared of me.” 

Peretto said hesitantly, 
“That’s not so, Benno. I think 
she’s feeling a little guilty, 
like a lot of the rest of us.” 
“Because it’s hard to keep 
loving made-up things like us 
when you’ve got real kids of 
your own.” 

“We put a lot of love into 
you — ” 

“But that was different. 
That was when you thought 
you couldn’t have any kids.” 
“Earth was pretty hot 
when we left it. We couldn’t 
be sure we wouldn’t be sterile 
forever. We had to have some- 
thing, Benno.” 

“So now you’ve got some- 
thing and you’re stuck with 
it.” Benno looked out of the 
window where the yellow sun 
of Skander V was shining on 
experimental plots and groves 
of trees, on Residential, on 
the dunes and the salt lake 
and the rest of the Colony be- 
yond. “And it makes you sick 
to look at us and think you 
wanted and loved us.” 
“Benno!” 

“But it’s true! Dickon told 
me Wenslow said that to 
him.” 

“Oh, Wenslow.” 

“Well, maybe you don’t like 
him so much either. But you 
and he are on the same side.” 
“Do we have to pick sides ?” 
“We can’t help it. A lot of 
the guys are talking funny, 
too.” 

Peretto waited. The an- 
PHYLLIS GOTLIEB 




droids were unable to lie and 
he was unwilling to make 
Benno compromise himself. 

Finally Benno said uncom- 
fortably, “About Bimbo Har- 
rington ...” 

“But you know he drowned. 
We couldn’t do anything for 
him.” 

“Nobody ever saw his 
body.” 

“It wasn’t a thing to see. 
He — ^the android body decom- 
poses so — it’s not anything 
we can help.” 

“Well, they think — ” Benno 
was beginning, but the door 
opened. 

It was Wenslow. His pale 
eyes flashed and his thin nos- 
trils twitched at the smoke in 
the air. 

“At the cigars again, I see, 
Benno,” he said pleasantly. 
Benno blew a mouthful of 
smoke into his face and 
walked put. 

After the door had closed he 
could hear the voices: 

“I swear to God if that 
thing belonged to me — ” 

Peretto interrupted weari- 
ly: “You leave cigars around 
because you get a good snide 
laugh out of seeing him smoke 
them. If he manages to do it 
without amusing you, too bad 
for you. Now let’s stop nig- 
gling and get to work.” 

" AND then she said, ‘I don’t 
■l\. know what’s got into 
you, you used to call me Mom 
until—’ ” 

“And if you tried it she’d 
GINGERBREAD BOY 



twist your ears off for you, 
the bitch!” 

Benno watched Dickon’s 
face across the campfire and 
realized that Dickon had 
probably paid very bitterly 
for his own enjoyment in 
blowing smoke at Wenslow. 
He would have to be more 
careful of his pleasures in the 
future. 

He said, trying to keep the 
peace, “The Perettos aren’t 
bad, Dickon. You have to be 
fair to them.” 

The shadows in Dickon’s 
eyes were as deep as the 
humps of the dunes against 
the night sky. “You can say 
that, smoking cigars and 
turning yourself into a clown 
to suck up to them.” 

“If I did that, I’d be selling 
my soul,” said Benno. “But if 
I left off smoking when I like 
it just for fear of anything 
they might do. I’d be selling 
my soul twice over.” 

“Soul! I’d like to see you 
show me where you’ve got a 
soul.” 

“Nothing you could see! 
Oh, hell. I guess if I had to 
live with the Wenslows I’d be 
as big a bastard as you are.” 
Dickon answered him in 
kind, and he waited for a 
slackening. 

“ — but don’t you see? They 
loved us and made us love 
them, so they think we’ve got 
immortal souls. That’s the 
only thing that’s keeping 
them from wiping us out.” 
“So what makes you think 

93 




they haven’t started wiping 
us out already?” asked Rudi 
Metzner. “What about Bim- 
bo?” 

“I asked Peretto about that 
today,” Benno said slowly. 
“He said he’d drowned.” 
“And you believed him? 
Sure he drowned. But it was 
in one of those tanks, you can 
bet. Did you know they’d 
started up the tanks again? 
What’s your guess about what 
they’re doing?” 

“I don’t get you.” 

“Take a look in one of those 
tanks,” said Dickon softly. 
“Try it in the middle of the 
night, sneak around the back 
where the guard won’t see 
you. You’ll see they’ve got a 
thing in there, something 
new they’re making, and I’ll 
bet they started it with Bim- 
bo. Maybe Peretto and Wens- 
low wouldn’t bloody their 
hands on us, but that don’t 
stop them from making a new 
kind of android to do their 
work, a killer that’s not so 
scared of souls! Take a look 
and see.” 

“I’ll promise this,” said 
Benno. “You try messing 
around with the Perettos and 
I’ll kill you dead, Dickon. Be- 
cause you haven’t got the soul 
of a flea!” 

T he stars were dim beyond 
the two moons that made 
the shadows shift and fall; 
rustling trees covered his foot- 
steps in the grass. He cursed 
them, he didn’t believe them, 

94 



he had sworn he wouldn’t go. 
But here he was. He had wak- 
ened in the middle of the 
night as though he had 
planned it, and dressed and 
crept out. He stood still for a 
moment. If his world broke 
now, he would never be able 
to love the Perettos again, and 
there was nothing else. Yet he 
went on. 

At the back of the fence he 
had the whole building be- 
tween himself and the guard. 
He climbed the chicken-wire 
and dropped down silently. 
He knew that the lock of the 
tank-room window was brok- 
en. No one was worried about 
theft. The guard was there 
only to prevent the disturb- 
ance of delicate adjustments. 

He pushed at the window. 
It creaked, but the wind cov- 
ered the noise. 

Inside it was very dark, 
but he knew this room well. 
Two steps and he had found 
the bank of switches on the 
first tank. One dim light was 
all he dared. Even in the dusk 
beyond the peephole that one 
was certainly empty. He 
pressed back the toggle and 
moved on. The second was 
empty too, and he began to 
hope. But the third — 

He was afraid to turn on 
more than one light, and the 
liquid was cloudy, but there 
was definitely a creature 
there. 

In a second it became sen- 
sitive to the light and began 
to turn and thresh about. The 



PHYLLIS GOTLIEB 




cloudiness enveloped it again, 
but he had seen it. Sickened, 
he turned the light out and 
groped for the window. He 
dropped down and climbed 
the wire again, but without 
caring where he was going or 
whether he was caught. 

A few steps away from the 
fence a group of figures 
emerged from the bushes and 
encircled him. 

“Couldn’t resist, eh. Ben- 
no?” 

“What do you want?” he 
whispered. 

“We had a bet on you,” said 
Dickon, grinning. “Go ahead, 
tell us what you saw there.” 
Benno was silent for a mo- 
ment, and said finally, “All 
right, I saw something there, 
but not clearly enough to tell 
what it was.” 

“But we told you what it 
was and you know. Go on, 
won’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Benno. 

“Not feelin’ so snotty now, 
are you, Benno?” 

Hurrah for our side. He 
would have lashed out at 
them, and turned to find the 
weak point in the circle, but 
they were his equals. 

“Let me go,” he said. 
“Okay, for now. But re- 
member, we’ll be calling on 
you one day. You’ll come.” 
He ran, and their laughter 
followed him. 

I T was afternoon and, with 
Poppy swinging on his 
hand, Benno tramped along 

GINGERBREAD BOY 



the stretch of sand that 
threaded through the tufted 
dunes and separated the back 
gardens of Residential from 
the lake. The sun was shining, 
but not for Benno. 

He tried to tell himself that 
he had no proof for anything, 
but he felt weak inside in the 
face of Dickon’s hatred of the 
humans. 

“Let’s dig here,” said Pop- 
py, “and we’ll find the treas- 
ure.” Benno sat down while 
she went to work. Her pres- 
ence was Mrs. Peretto’s way 
of saying: I was a fool yes- 
terday, and didn’t mean what 
I said. If that was the case, he 
had nothing to fear there. 
He looked around. The beach 
was quiet, the waters rippled 
sluggishly. 

A few houses down, a 
woman came through the 
back gate and out onto the 
sand, a naked baby tucked 
under one arm and a flannel 
blanket under the other. It 
was Mrs. Harrington. She 
was wearing brief red shorts 
and a fluffy blouse r a black 
ponytail bobbed on her tanned 
neck. 

She trotted down to one of 
the sundecks near the water 
and sat there, sloshing her 
feet while the baby kicked on 
the blanket beside her, making 
bitobly sounds. 

Then Harrington, out from 
work, swung down the gar- 
den, leaped over the gate, and 
ran across the sands. He 
grabbed the ponytail, pulled 

95 




the woman’s head back, and 
kissed her upside-down face. 
He whispered in her ear, ges- 
turing back toward the house. 
She shushed him, glancing at 
Benno and Poppy. He ca- 
joled ; she resisted. Finally he 
pulled her by the arm and 
she shrugged, tucked up the 
baby, and followed him back 
to the house. Benno could hear 
them giggling as they went. 

“When I get big, I’m going 
to be a mummy,” said Poppy. 
“And you can be the daddy, 
Benno.” 

“Yeah,” said Benno. 

He crouched there, trapped 
in the amber of twelve-year- 
old boyhood on Skander. Pe- 
retto had said to him, “We 
would have been happy to 
make you — complete, if we 
could. We just don’t know 
enough.” But Benno, watch- 
ing the Harringtons, knew 
very well what he would 
never be. 

Poppy put aside her pail 
and shovel and came over to 
him, bracing herself between 
his knees and resting her fore- 
head against his. Her breath 
was like apples ; she scratched 
his face gently and he kissed 
her, rich with the pleasure of 
feeling a living being against 
him. This is all I’m good for. 
He hugged her as she giggled, 
and ruffled his hair in her 
neck, grunting like the wild 
pigs the colonists hunted for 
sport. 

Someone shrieked behind 
him: “You filthy beast! Let 

96 



go of that child at once, do 
you hear?” 

He was so taken with sur- 
prise that he fell back in the 
sand, pulling the child on top 
of him. Mrs. Wenslow was 
standing over him, fists tight, 
face contorted: 

“Dirty, dirty thing! Wait 
till everybody hears about 
this ! Oh, to hear the Perettos, 
butter wouldn’t melt in your 
mouth ! I’ll tell them different, 
you — ” 

But Benno righted himself 
and ran, leaving Poppy howl- 
ing behind him. The woman 
knew he couldn’t — ! But it 
was no use stopping to argue. 
He ran. 

In the hills he knew a few 
caves, under a matting of low 
gnarled trees. He squatted in 
one of them, nursing his hurt 
as the sun sank and the moons 
swung by. He thought and 
thought till his mind turned 
sickly and his head ached. 
Was he as innocent as he 
thought? He was afraid to 
search into the unexplored 
reaches of his mind, but he 
knew for sure that his loins 
were empty, and he cursed 
himself and his makers. 

Exhausted finally, he 
groped in his pocket for one 
of the cigars he had filched 
the day before. He stared at it, 
shrugged and lit it. 

He sat there smoking and 
watching the stars as they 
filtered in and out of the 
leaves. He didn’t know what 
he was waiting for.

f’P'UT that out, you nut! You 
A want to get caught?” Ben- 
no peered ahead; he could 
see nothing but stars and 
branches. 

“Dickon?” he called tenta- 
tively. 

Pushing aside the boughs, 
Dickon slipped in and sat be- 
side him. “Go on, put it out. 
They’ll see us a mile oif .” 

“I don’t care.” 

“I do, God damn it, the 
thing’s suffocating me.” 

“You wouldn’t have found 
me without it,” said Benno 
sensibly as he put it out. 

“Now they’re not going to 
find tis,” said Dickon. “What 
happened? I was out hunting, 
and they rounded us up and 
sent us to bring you in. Huh 1” 
“I was playing with Poppy, 
horsing around. Somebody 
thought it was something 
dirty.” 

“Boy, I love you for that!” 
Dickon thumped him on the 
back. “It’s what I’ve been 
waiting for, but I never 
thought you’d be the one. Who 
was it? Not Peretto?” 

“No. It was Mrs. Wenslow.” 
Benno was shocked by the 
silence. No sneers, no laugh- 
ter. He turned to look for 
Dickon’s face in the dark, and 
thought suddenly: he loves 
them. 

Dickon said in a low voice, 
“Nobody would play with that 
scrawny kid of theirs. They’ve 
got him so he’s scared to let 
out a peep.” 

“I’m sorry, Dickon.” 

GINGERBREAD BOY 



“What for, you bloody fool? 
What do you mean?” 

“Nothing,” said Benno. 

Dickon raised his head: 
“Listen, there they are. Hal- 
loo! Halloo!” he called softly 
down the hill. 

“Who?” asked Benno. 

“The rest of us; I’ve got 
two dozen down there, only 
ten missing.” He divided the 
branches and called, “Come 
on up, you guys, I’ve found 
him I” 

“But what — ” Benno be- 
gan, but Dickon was waving 
the others in. 

“Hi!” they cried. “What 
was all the business about?” 

D ickon guffawed. “He 
was horsing with the Pe- 
rotto brat and they thought 
he—” 

He elaborated to an extent 
that made Benno glad the 
darkness hid his flushed face. 
He could see their eyes glit- 
tering in the dimness. They 
were staring at him with re- 
spect. 

“Gee, lemme touch you! 
You been holdin’ out on us, 
Benno? Maybe you got — ” 
“Shut up, shut up, for God’s 
sake!” snapped Benno. “He’s 
feeding you a line. I’m just 
the same as you are.” His peo- 
ple! 

Dickon laughed again, nas- 
tily. “All right, forget about 
that for now. We’ve got to 
get the others together first. 
Then we can start out.” 
“Start out for what?” Ben- 

97 




no felt the incredulous stares 
around him. 

“You all there? What do 
you think we’ve got these 
guns for? We’re all set to 
knock the lot of them off the 
planet.” 

Benno caught his breath. 
“Just for me?” 

“Who else? Think we’re 
gonna let ’em get away with 
it?” 

Benno stared at their set 
faces in the dusk. “But they’re 
not mad at you, you damn 
fools!” 

“What do you mean? 
Think you’re going to back 
out after getting us all up 
here?” 

“I didn’t. You came after 
me.” He tried to keep his 
voice level. “They got noth- 
ing on you. I just came up 
here to think for a while. Let 
me go back and take my 
lumps and we’ll forget the 
whole business.” 

“Forget it!” Dickon swung 
up the rifle. “You’re coming 
down with us right now. I’m 
giving the orders and you’re 
gonna do what I say !” 

“Yeah? You want to flght, 
okay, but you don’t pin it on 
me.” Benno grasped the rifle 
barrel and pulled it to his 
chest. “Go on, kill me.” 

Dickon stood indecisive. 
Everyone knew that if Benno 
were dead the whole affair 
would collapse. Then he 
pulled the rifle out of Ben- 
no’s hands and set it aside, 
snarling. 



“Okay, you guys. Put away 
the guns and let the scab have 
it!” 

W ORDS rattled at him: 
“. betbetbetterterter 
i-i-idededea . .” He shook 
his head and the words 
sounded in his ears as he 
pulled himself out of his sleep 
or coma, he never knew 
which. 

Mist was pushing into the 
cave. The trees outside seemed 
clotted with cobwebs. His lids 
were heavy and crusted. His 
body felt flayed to the bone, 
sore in every joint, muscle, 
nerve. His tongue pulled away 
from his palate with a wrench 
and his arms flopped like dy- 
ing Ashes. He looked at 
them and saw that the wrists 
were bound. 

“. don't know why I 
never thought of it before 
...” Benno moved his head 
again and nearly groaned. 
There was no comfort in the 
sickly early dawn rolling by 
in wet drifts of fog. 

“Much better idea,” Dick- 
on was saying. “We can’t just 
run down there waving guns. 
They’d have us knocked off 
in an hour. But if we pick up 
one of their brats they’ll come 
after us. They’ll never know 
where to find us in all these 
holes, and we can do what we 
like with them.” 

Benno pulled himself up 
till he sat hunched over his 
knees. He didn’t dare touch 
his face, even to rub his eyes.

PHYLLIS GOTLIEB 




“All we have to decide is 
whose kid,” said one of the 
others. 

“There’s the scab up,” said 
Dickon. “Knock him on the 
head, somebody.” 

“Leave him alone, Dickon, 
he never hurt yqu.” Dickon 
cocked an eyebrow at the 
speaker and went back to his 
plan. 

“Whose! Think anybody’d 
miss Wenslow’s brat? We 
want Peretto’s. They’ll put it 
on Benno, and if he gets 
killed, nobody’ll worry.” 

Benno stared at Dickon 
with horror and pity. His per- 
sonality had disintegrated 
like a child’s in a tantrum, 
leaving only an idiot rage. 
But the other androids were 
shifting about, looking at 
each other. 

Finally, Rudi said, “We 
didn’t figure on anybody get- 
ting killed in this, Dickon.” 
Dickon turned on him : 
“What did you think, you 
were playing tiddley winks ?” 
“We wanted to get even a 
bit, get them under our thumb 
and give them a scare — ” 
“Yeah, and end up with 
love and kisses and an all-day 
sucker!” 

Benno said, “Isn’t that 
what you want, Dickon ?” 

“You shut up! Keep your 
mouth out of this!” He was 
almost sobbing. “I could kill 
you now easy as — ” 

“No you couldn’t, Dickon,” 
said Rudi quietly. 

“Jesus, a bunch of cup- 

GINGERBREAD BOY 



cakes! I used to think you 
wanted to be men ! But I’ll do 
it. I’ll do it myself, and I’ll pull 
you in with me. Watch, you’ll 
see I’ll split the whole damn 
planet in two !” 

H e leaped out and flung 
himself down the slope 
with a crash of branches and 
was lost in the mist. 

“Oh, God,” said Rudi. He 
was about to follow when 
Benno cried out, “Don’t do 
it! It’s too thick to find him 
in that.” 

“But if he hurts the kid 
they’ll wipe us all out!” 

“Undo my hands,” said 
Benno. They freed him. 

“What do you think you 
can do?” 

“I shouldn’t have run off in 
the first place.” Benno peered 
into the mist that was slowly 
settling like water down a 
clogged drain. “He won’t get 
much of a head start in that; 
if I can reach Peretto he’ll 
listen to me.” 

“But you’re a mess.” 

Benno rubbed his wrists. 
“We’ll all be pretty messy if 
I don’t go.” 

Rudi said, “We’ve got the 
guns — ” 

“We’d end up killing some- 
body. Besides . this is 
really between the Wenslows 
and me* and that’s how it’ll 
have to be settled.” 

“What do you want us to 
do?” 

“Oh, wait around here half 
an hour, and when you get 

99 




back, tell them I got away. 
That way your tongue won’t 
tie up on you, it’s true as far 
as it goes.” 

“But hell, they’ll know 
there’s something fishy 
there !” 

“Sure, but they won’t do 
anything about it.” Benno 
rubbed his sore head. “They 
might even respect you for 
sticking up for me.” 

Rudi said awkwardly, 
“Don’t rub it in, Benno. Here, 
take a gun anyway.” 

“Nuts. I don’t want to shoot 
anybody. Or give them an ex- 
cuse to shoot me.” 

H e scrambled down, aching 
at every move, catching 
drunkenly at the dripping 
branches. At the bottom he 
stopped to get his breath and 
pull together his ripped 
clothes. 

How would Dickon go 
about stealing a child from 
the midst of Residential? 

The children usually played 
outside after breakfast when 
the mist had cleared and the 
grass dried off a little. Some- 
times the androids took care 
of them after their work in 
the fields and vegetable gar- 
dens. Today there would be 
no androids, and perhaps the 
children would not be trusted 
outdoors. Would the humans 
be expecting an attack? Dick- 
on would take the chance and 
find out. 

Benno cut over towards the 
lakeshore and the dunes, in 

100 



spite of the possibility that 
they might be ambushed. 
There weren’t enough men to 
hide behind every dune. As 
the sun came out he climbed 
a rise and checked his direc- 
tion. The quarry might have 
changed plans a hundred 
times already, but with 
Dickon’s anger, and the rifle 
under his arm, Benno thought 
the chance was small. 

He dipped in and out 
among the dunes. He saw no 
one else on the sands yet, but 
he knew that his dark moving 
figure would be eminently no- 
ticeable. He scrambled on, 
glancing uneasily at the 
buildings across the way. 
Dickon might have ended up 
at Administration with an at- 
tempt to attack Wenslow, but 
he thought there would have 
been more noise and running 
about in that case. No, he 
would have to assume that 
Dickon, like himself, was still 
skulking. But there was very 
little time. 

Here, now, was the place 
where he and Poppy had been 
— yesterday? And where Mrs. 
Wenslotv — he closed his mind 
on it, but here, also, was 
where he had watched the 
Harringtons with lewd eyes 
as they whispered together: 

— don’t start on me here, 
Boh, for God’s sake. There’s 
Benno and Poppy over there, 
watching us. 

A kid and an android? 
What’s it got to do with them 
anyway? 



PHYLLIS GOTLIEB 




I don’t know. Some of those 
androids . 

Some of those androids lie 
awake at night, listening for 
sounds of love. 

B ENNO lay on the hillock 
of sand, the sun was 
risen. The throbbing aches 
in his body washed away, he 
was comfortable. The warmth 
of the sun told him this was 
all he could ever want; men 
were hateful, he did not need 
them, but the warmth and 
the sun . 

Dickon! Where was Dick- 
on? He leaped up, afraid that 
he had slept an hour, and 
what Dickon could have done 
in that time — but the sun 
hadn’t moved. His drowsiness 
had only stretched the mo- 
ment. But the danger of sleep 
was real. He shook his head 
and rubbed his eyes. 

Then he saw his first man, 
down behind him where the 
sundecks began. 

He couldn’t tell whether he 
was armed, but he was mov- 
ing- east and heading for 
Benno. Benno scrambled for 
the next hillock. The man 
speeded up. That’s done it. 
He would neyer make the last 
quarter mile at this rate. He 
gave up and began to run. 

“. or I’ll shoot!” came 
the end of a yell. Benno 
thought he was a liar. The 
noise of the shot knocked him 
off his feet with fright. He 
scurried on, glancing back 
once to see the pursuer run- 

GINGERBREAD BOY 



ning, not stopping to aim. 
Because I’m not armed. He 
had no idea how he would 
stop Dickon without a gun, 
but if he had brought one, he 
would have been dead by now. 
He looked back again. Now 
there were two of them. 
Good! 

He cut north, straight 
through the trees, and made 
a beeline across the central 
green, gathering pursuers 
and frightening children with 
his beaten face. 

Then he heard a shriek 
from back of the Perettos’. 

In the yard he found 
Dickon at last. Poppy scream- 
ing under one arm, rifie in the 
other hand, Mrs. Peretto at 
bay. Benno stopped at the 
look on Dickon’s face. It was 
as though he had evolved 
from some other feral animal 
and were now reverting to it. 

Benno screamed, “Dickon! 
Dickon!” and without think- 
ing tore up a lump of sod from 
the border edge and threw it. 
It struck Dickon in the face, 
but almost before it struck 
Benno heard the sound of the 
rifle, and Dickon fell, shot 
through the heart. 

Behind them, Wenslow 
lowered the rifle. 

Dickon sprawled gro- 
tesquely, his face tamed at 
last, and his mouth full of 
dirt. 

7 didn’t have to do that to 
him . and I’m the only 
one who’s sorry . Poppy 
flung herself against him, Pe- 

101 




retto and his wife crowded 
them. Peretto said teasingly, 
“I think you love him more 
than us, don’t you. Poppy?” 
“He has perverted the 
child,” snarled Wenslow furi- 
ously. 

B ENNO was packing. Since 
nearly all he owned had 
been given to him by humans, 
he was too proud to take ev- 
erything he wanted. But he 
had a knife, the clothes he 
wore, a few things he had 
made himself ... He left 
off a moment, went over to the 
window and looked out at the 
familiar scene. 

Below, the children were 
playing, and he watched their 
wheeling patterns on the 
grass; their cries were like 
birdcalls in the misty verge of, 
evening. ... 

The door opened. Peretto 
came in and closed it behind 
him. His eyes took in the col- 
ored handkerchief in the best 
tradition spread out with 
Benno’s possessions. 

“You need an icebag for 
that face,” he said. “I brought 
it.” 

“I don’t want it.” But he 
took it and held it to his swol- 
len jaw. 

Peretto drew in on his cig- 
arette and let the coil of smoke 
drift away on his words. 
“Why are you running 
away ?” 

“You saw what he did,” 
said Benno. “You heard what 
he said.” 



“Do you know anyone who 
agrees with him?” 

Benno looked away. 

“They’re all afraid of us,” 
he said after a moment, not 
very loud. 

“You’ve shown them not to 
be. The rest are back and 
there won’t be any trouble 
now. You know, you didn’t 
have to go running off j'^ester- 
day, nobody believed that 
woman.” 

“I — I’m not going because 
of her.” 

“You’re running away so 
you can be by yourself. And 
pretend you’re a man.” 

“That’s a lousy thing to 
say!” 

“You’re an android, Ben- 
no,” Peretto said gently. 
“You can only be a man be- 
tween the ears.” 

“I’m nothing.” They stared 
at each other, two cloudy im- 
ages peering from beyond the 
look’Tig-glass. 

“The men and women who 
have the androids love them 
and — ” 

“They ruin them and kill 
them,” Benno said stubborn- 
ly. 

Peretto sighed. “There 
were some wild stories flying 
around about what was in the 
tank, weren’t there? Dickon 
started most of them. Don’t 
deny it.” 

“Well?” 

“It’s only that the Harring- 
tons wanted another an- 
droid in their family. Another 
Bimbo.”

said Benno. Then 
he sneered. “So he can 
mind the baby while they — ” 
He clapped his hand over his 
mouth and sat down on the 
bed, trembling, unable to make 
himself stop. 

Peretto said very quietly: 
“You sounded exactly like 
Wenslow when you said that. 
You even looked exactly like 
him.” 

Benno saw a black gulf 
falling away before him, the 
proud goail he had been run- 
ning for, a cave in the hills 
where he would eat hate till 
his soul was consumed, his 
humanity gone, and he had 
become the animal looking 
out of Dickon’s eyes when he 
died. 

“What am I to do?” He 
clasned his aching head in his 
hands. 

“What can you do, except 
learn to live without envy or 
hate?” 

When he looked up, Peret- 
to was gone. The dark was 
rising to blend him with the 
room, the house, the Colony. 
There was nothing else. All 
he could ever have was right 
here. 

He sat there while the 
moons rose and swung in 
their eccentric orbits. When 
he stood up finally, he did not 
unpack his bundle. Not yet. 
But he left it behind him on 
the table and went down to 
the Perettos.

Al owned a profitable 
plumbing company. Was 
cupidity going to make 
it go down the drain? 



THE HOUSE 
IN BEL AIRE 

By MARGARET ST. CLAIR 



A SOLID gold toilet seat is 
unsettling to the mind. Al- 
fred Gluckshoffer, proprietor 
of the Round the Clock 
Plumbing Company, raised 
and lowered the lid several 
times experimentally and de- 
cided that it, too, was gold. It 
looked like gold, it felt like 
gold : Gluckshoffer, whose 

brother-in-law Milt was a 
salesman for a firm of manu- 
facturing jewelers, and who 
had heard Milt talking about 
carats and alloys as long as he 
had known him, was sure it 
was gold. About fourteen 
carat. 

From the doorway the el- 
derly party in the dusty dress 



suit cleared his throat. It was 
not a menacing sound, but Al- 
fred jumped. Hastily he pick- 
ed up his screwdriver and 
began prying at the valve in 
the float again. 

“Oh, it’s a genuine stone,” 
Milt said later that day. 
“They cut the synthetics out 
of a boule, see, and they al- 
ways show the curved lines. 
Yours has a good colpr, too. 
The deeper the color in sap- 
phire, the more valuable, and 
this one is nearly true corn- 
flower blue. A beauty. Worth 
maybe four or five hundred. 
Where’d you get it, Al?” 

Gluckshoffer decided to bp 
frank. “Out of that house I 



105 




was telling you about. The one 
where they called me to fix the 
can in the middle of the night. 
I dropped my pliers under the 
washbasin, and when I got 
down to pick them up, I found 
it. There was a sort of patch 
of inlaid work over the tub, 
wire and stone and tile and 
stuff, and I guess it must have 
fallen out of that.” 

Milt stuck his hands in his 
pockets and began to walk up 
and down the shop. Cupidity 
was coating his features with 
a dreamy, romantic glaze. 
“Think you could find the 
house again, Al?” he asked. 

“I don’t know. Like I told 
you, they called for me in a 
car with all the blinds down, 
and before I got out they tied 
a cloth over my eyes. I could- 
n’t see a thing. There was a 
swimming pool on the left as 
we went in — I could tell by 
the way it echoed — and when 
I was getting out of the car I 
brushed up against a big tall 
hedge. Oh, yes, and from the 
way the streets felt, I think it 
was out in Bel Aire.” 

Milt sagged. “A house with 
a hedge and a swimming pool 
in Bel Aire. That’s about like 
looking for a girl with brown 
eyes.” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” Gluck- 
shoffer said perversely. “I 
might be able to tell it if I ran 
across it again. There was a 
kind of funny feel to the place. 
Milt. Sleepy. Dead. Why? 
Why’re you so keen on locat- 
ing it?” 

106 



“Don’t be a dope,” Milt 
said. “You want to be a 
plumber all your life?” 

T hey located the house on 
the fifth night. It stood by 
itself on what must have been 
nearly two acres of ground, a 
whitely glimmering bulk, 
lightless and somnolent. 

“Looks like there’s nobody 
home,” Milt said as he 
brought the car to a noiseless 
halt. “You oughtn’t to have 
any trouble, Al.” 

Gluckshoffer snorted softly. 
“There’s at least two people 
on the place,” he whispered, 
“the chauffeur and the old 
geezer in the dress suit that 
called for me that night. Re- 
member what you promised, 
Milt, about coming in for me 
if I’m not back in forty-five 
minutes. After all, this was 
your idea. And don’t forget 
about honking twice if a pa- 
trol car comes by, either.” His 
tone, though subdued, was 
fierce. 

“Oh, sure,” Milt said easily. 
“Don’t worry about it. I won’t 
forget.” 

Al Gluckshoffer got out of 
the car and began to worm his 
way through the pale green 
leaves of a tall pittosporum 
hedge. As he padded past the 
swimming pool (on the left, 
as he had remembered it) in 
his tennis shoes, he found 
himself swallowing a yawn. 

This was the darnedest 
place. As he’d told Milt, there 
were two people at home — 

MARGARET ST. CUIR 




probably more, siucc ,, 
wouldn’t keep a chauffeur un- 
less there was somebody for 
him to drive — and the old 
party in the dress suit must 
sleep in the house because he’d 
said something to A1 about 
the noise of the can having 
awakened him. But the feel in 
the air was so sleepy and dead 
that you’d think everybody on 
the place had been asleep for 
the last hundred years. 

At the back of the house a 
window looked promising. A1 
tried it and found it unlocked. 
Stifling a yawn, and then an- 
other one, he raised the win- 
dow and slipped inside. 

He went into a lavatory on 
the ground floor first. He had 
unscrewed the gold faucets on 
the washbasin and pried eight 
or ten stones out of the mosaic 
on the wall before it occurred 
to him that he was wasting 
his time. Would people in a 
house like this put their best 
stuff in the cans? Obvious’y 
not. The place to look for the 
hot stuff — the really hot 
hot stuff — would be in the 
bedrooms upstairs. Palladium- 
backed clothes brushes. Mir- 
rors set with big diamonds all 
around the edges. He was a 
dope not to have thought of it 
before. 

A1 wrapped the faucets care- 
fully in the old rags he had 
brought to muffle their chink- 
ing and put them in his little 
satchel. Noiselessly as a shad- 
ow, he stole up the stair. 

In the upper hall he hesi- 

THE HOUSE IN BEL AIRE 



utLca. His idea about the bed- 
rooms was all very well, but 
it wouldn’t do to pick one 
where the old geezer in the 
dress suit, say, was asleep. 

T he moonlight slanting 
through the big windows 
in the hall and falling on the 
door to his right put an end to 
Al’s difficulties. There were 
cobwebs thick between the 
door itself and the jamb, cob- 
webs all over the frame. A 
room like that must be per- 
fectly safe. There couldn’t be 
anybody in a room like that. 
Softly he turned the knob. 

The bed, swathed in shim- 
mering gauze, was at one end 
of the room. A1 paid no atten- 
tion to it. His eyes were fixed 
on the dressing table where, 
even in the subdued light, he 
could make out jewelry — ear- 
rings, rings, tiara, bracelets — 
lying in a corruscating heap. 
The pendants at the corners 
of the tiara were teardrop- 
shaped things, big as ban- 
tam’s eggs, and the earrings 
and bracelets were set all over 
with flashing gems. 

A1 licked his lips. He put 
out a skeptical hand toward 
the tiara and touched the pen- 
dants very cautiously. They 
were cold, and from the mo- 
tion his hand imparted to 
them, they started to swing 
back and forth and give out 
rays of colored light. 

From sheer nervous excite- 
ment he was on the edge of 
bursting into tears or some- 

107 




thing. The stones in the brace- 
lets Seemed to be square-cut 
diamonds, and the pendants 
on the tiara surpassed any- 
thing he had ever imagined. 
They made him feel like get- 
ting down and kowtowing in a 
paroxysm of unworthiness. 
He controlled himself and be- 
gan to put the jewels away in 
his bag. 

The earrings were follow- 
ing the bracelets into custody 
when there was a slight creak 
from the bed. A1 turned to 
stone. In very much less than 
a second (nervous impulses, 
being electrical in origin, 
move at the speed of light, 
which is 186,000 m.p.s.), he 
had decided that the jewelry 
was a trap, that the trap was 
being sprung, and that he was 
hauling tail out. He began 
backing toward the door. 
There was another creak from 
the bed. This time it was ac- 
companied by a wonderful, a 
glorious, flash of prismatic 
light. 

A1 Gluckshoffer faltered, 
torn cruelly between cupidity 
and fear. If it wasn’t a trap, 
the biggest diamond in the 
whole world must be hanging 
around the throat, or other- 
wise depending from the per- 
son, or whoever was sleeping 
in the bed. Indecision almost 
made him groan. Then he 
made up his mind and, the 
sweat starting out on his fore- 
head, tiptoed in the direction 
of the flash of light. 

The beauty of the girl lying 

108 



on the bed in the moonlight 
was so extreme that he forgot 
all about the necklace which 
clasped her throat. He stared 
down at her for an instant. 
Then he put his bag on the 
floor, knelt beside the bed and 
drew the curtains back. He 
leaned forward and kissed her 
on the lips. 

H IS heart was beating like 
a hammer. Slowly her 
shadowy lids opened and she 
looked into his eyes. A faint, 
joyous smile began to curve 
her lips. 

The expression was suc- 
ceeded almost instantly by a 
look of regal rage. “By the 
scepter of Mab,” the girl said, 
sitting up in bed and glaring 
at him, “you are not His High- 
ness at all ! In fact, I perceive 
clearly from your attitude 
and bearing that you are not 
any Highness. You are some 
low creature who has no prop- 
er business of any sort in the 
palace. You are Another One.” 
With the words, she press- 
ed a button beside her bed. 
While A1 cowered back, there 
was a clamor as strident as 
that of a burglar alarm, and 
then the elderly party in the 
dress suit came in, yawning 
and rubbing his eyes. 

“He awakened me in the 
proper way,” the girl said, 
gesturing in Al’s direction, 
“but he is by no means the 
proper person.” 

“So I see. Your Highness,” 
the old gent said with a bow. 

MARGARET ST. CUIR 




“I believe — ” He peered close- 
ly at Gluckshoffer, who push- 
ed himself hard against the 
wall and tried to pretend that 
he wasn’t there. “I believe he 
is the plumber whom I called 
in last week to repair the lav- 
atory. I am sorry. What dis- 
position does Your Highness 
wish me to make of him ?” 

“Use the transformation 
machine to make him into 
something,” the princess said, 
turning around and punching 
at the pillows on her bed. 
They were embroidered with 
a little crown. 

“What would Your High- 
ness suggest?” 

“Anything you like,” the 
princess replied. The pillows 
arranged to her satisfaction, 
she lay back on them once 
more. “Something appropri- 
ate, of course. Frankly, Nor- 
freet. I’m getting tired of 
being waked pnce or twice a 
year by some incompetent 
idiot who has no legitimate 
business in the palace in the 
first place. The next bungler 
who wakes me up, I want you 
to turn into a mouse and give 
to the cat next door to play 
with. Good night.” Delicately 
she closed her eyes. 

“Good night, Your High- 
ness,” the chamberlain replied 
with another low bow. He 
turned to Al, who had been 



THE HOUSE IN BEL AIRE 



listening to this talk of trans- 
formations with a comforting 
sense of its impossibility, and 
fixed him with a hypnotic 
gaze. “Come with me,” he said 
sternly. “Before I transform 
you, you must repair the dam- 
age you have done.” 

S OME twenty rriinutes later, 
the chamberlain gave the 
solid brass cuspidor which 
had been Al Gluckshoffer a 
contemptuous shove with his 
foot. He ought to take the 
thing up to the attic and leave 
it, but he was getting dread- 
fully sleepy. He needed his 
rest at his age. Some other 
time. 

He got into bed, his joints 
creaking. Her Highness was 
right; there were altogether 
too many intruders in the pal- 
ace these days. They needed 
to be shown their place, made 
an example of. The next per- 
son who woke him up was 
going to be the object of some- 
thing special in the way of 
transformations. Norfreet be- 
gan to snore. 

And on the other side of 
the pittosporum hedge. Milt 
looked at his watch and de- 
cided that it was time to go in 
and see what had happened to 
Al. He started to worm his 
way through the hedge.

A 

MATTER 

OF 

TASTE 



By JOSEPH WESLEY 
ILLUSTRATED BY RIHER 



1 ARRIVED on the fourth 
planet of Sunder’s Pride 
-stark naked and stood com- 
fortably in the snow, listening 
to the wind howl by, while 
waiting for the Expedition 
Manager to approach from 
the edge of the small clearing 
and welcome me. The Man- 
ager’s name is Obadiah Jones. 
Like the rest of the expedi- 
tion, he’s from one of the 
minor Vegan colonies — Kin- 
nison III — but he’s undiffer- 
entiated Earth stock. 

He bustled forward, wear- 
ing a full protective suit and 
helmet — the temperature is 
thirty degrees below zero cen- 
tigrade at noon and the at- 
mosphere is poisonous — but I 
could see the expression of re- 
lief on his face through his 
face plate. 

“You’re from Interstellar 
Insurance?” he panted under 
the one and a half G of Sun- 
der’s Pride. 



110 





I assented with a dignified 
nod. 

He looked me up and down 
— my skin wasn’t even show- 
ing goose pimples, of course — 
and then shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “The insurance company 
sent a first-class Mental Con- 
trol Operator, I see, but it was 
a waste of talent. Maybe they 
didn’t believe our reports. 
We’ve had our own operators 
here — good ones, too — and 
they haven’t been able to find 
any solution. The Aliens are 
much better at all sorts of 
Mind Control than even our 
most talented men. I know our 
Policy says that you can keep 
us from calling in the military 
authorities for a week, but it’s 
just a waste of time— and, 
more important, it’s a waste 
of lives, too. I suggest that 
you give us authority to call 
in the Navy right away.” 
“How many lives have you 
lost so far?” I asked. 

“Only a dozen, but at regu- 
lar intervals.” 

“That hardly seems exces- 
sive for an exploratory expe- 
dition,” I commented. 

He shook his head impa- 
tiently. “I said at regular in- 
tervals. The Aliens treat us 
like we were cattle. Or sheep.” 
“Not exactly,” I said, “or 
you would scarcely have called 
me in. You must be operating 
at a profit, and that means 
you’re trading with these 
Aliens.” 

He scowled, but did not 
deny it. 



O F COURSE I knew this 
already. As an independ- 
ent Claims Adjuster, it goes 
without saying that I’d check- 
ed into the case before tele- 
porting to the planet. Their 
profit was enormous, and our 
losses would be proportionate- 
ly large if the military was in- 
vited to come in and spoil 
trade while saving lives. 

Their charter called for ex- 
clusive trading rights on any 
planet they opened for ten 
years. And they had the usual 
clause in their Policy against 
loss by “government” action, 
meaning the military, even at 
their own invitation. The mil- 
itary is fast, but it’s not neat. 
The cost could run to billions 
for us, so my job was to try 
to find another way. 

“Well,” he said, “can we 
send an emergency signal to 
the Navy?” 

“When does the next regu- 
lar interval expire?” I asked. 

He checked the timepiece 
set into the sleeve of his suit, 
and then scratched some num- 
ber in the clean wind-swept 
surface of snow. His watch 
kept local time, of course. “In 
about fourteen Earth hours,” 
he translated at last. 

“Then there’s no hurry, is 
there?” I leaned against the 
gale that was blowing across 
the clearing. “Why don’t we 
go to your office so you can 
brief me?” 

He turned and stumped his 
way heavily to a gap at the 
edge of the clearing, and then 

111 



A MAHER OF TASTE 




along a narrow path that 
wound its way circuitously 
among tall, slender, tinkling, 
half-living ice trees. I strolled 
lightly beside him, but my 
bare feet left deep imprints in 
the crustless snow. In about 
fifteen minutes we reached 
the human settlement, with its 
airlock set modestly into a 
great mound of snow. 

Here we had a little diffi- 
culty; the lock was designed 
to pass bulky protective suits. 
If I had gone through it bare, 
I'd have let in some of the 
poisonous atmosphere into the 
camp. We solved that, though. 
Mr. Jones passed a suit out to 
me through the lock and I put 
it on. I wore it all the way to 
his office, and then he rustled 
me up one of his spare kilts — 
an ugly purple thing. 

“Now, Obadiah,” I said, 
after I’d lighted one of his 
stogies and settled myself into 
his most comfortable chair, 
“why this urgent call for 
help? Our records show that 
you’ve never hollered copper 
in your life, and you’ve had 
two expeditions nearly wiped 
out around you. You’ve got 
the best profit record in your 
organization,” 

“It’s those Aliens,” said Mr. 
Jones. “They arrived here on 
Sunder’s Pride just a few 
days behind us. I’ve always 
felt that someday we’d come 
up against some life-form that 
would be too much for us, and 
I’m afraid that we’ve done it 
at last. They trade us some of 

112 



the most magnificent works of 
art that have ever been seen 
in the universe — ^you’ve un- 
doubtedly admired some of 
them, and I’m sure you know 
the prices they bring — and 
they do it as if they were toss- 
ing glass beads to savages.” 
“And if we are such sav- 
ages, what can we have to 
trade in return?” I asked. 

“They don’t seem to be any 
great shakes with mechanical 
things,” he answered. “They 
call them ‘gadgets,’ but they 
buy them. The only trouble is, 
that’s not all they buy.” He 
was sweating, his face turn- 
ing as green as the polka dots 
on his kilt. He mopped his 
face and chest with a large 
handkerchief, and then sat 
there holding it and looking at 
it as if he’d never seen a ban- 
danna before. 

1 FELT sorry for him. These 
provincial types have an 
automatic feeling of horror at 
the thought of meeting some 
superior creatures that will 
replace man in the Galaxy, So 
I let him sit there for a couple 
of minutes to recover before I 
prompted him. 

“Well?” I said at last. "The 
additional stuff they buy — 
what is it?” This hadn’t been 
part of the reports. 

“Oh. Yes. Once every five 
days they take one man. I may 
have given you the idea that 
they killed them. They don’t. 
They ship them off. They say 
we are very popular, and 

JOSEPH WESLEY 




when there are enough of us 
on the market to bring the 
price down, we should make 
ideal pets. And we can’t do a 
thing to stop them.” 

I flicked the ash of my cigar 
delicately onto his carpet. 
“You can’t? What have you 
tried ?” 

He leaped to his feet and 
balled his fists belligerently. 
“I’m trying to call in the mili- 
tary, but first I’ve got to get 
through the red tape of call- 
ing in you insurance people. 
Now will you give me author- 
ity to call in a fleet before it’s 
too late?” 

I smiled in a superior man- 
ner and straightened a pleat 
on the hideous kilt. “If you 
feel this way, then why do you 
worry about money? Why 
didn’t you just call the fleet 
directly and forfeit your in- 
surance?” 

He glared at me through 
red-rimmed eyes. “I tried 
that,” he said. “If only we had 
some central government to 
turn to — but that’s irtipossible 
in space, of course. So I went 
to the only centralized force 
there is. And they said that 
they have to count on volun- 
tary contributions from the 
member planets, and they 
couldn’t afford to answer 
every call for help. They told 
me to contact my insurance 
company.” 

“Which,” I commented 
mildly, “is another central- 
ized force in space, in spite of 
what you say. It’s widespread, 

A MAHER OF TASTE 



it’s profit-making, and it gets 
the job done. Nobody has to 
tiy to beg for voluntary ap- 
propriations from penurious 
planetary governments.” 
“This isn’t a crackpot fear 
of aliens,” he said, as soon as 
I stopped talking. “I’ve seen 
aliens before, in all parts of 
the Galaxy. I don’t panic.” 
“Then you must have tried 
something else before holler- 
ing Uncle,” I said. “Like, per- 
haps, keeping all of your men 
inside the dome here when the 
time for another abduction 
approaches?” 

H e waved a hand im- 
patiently. “We’ve tried 
eveiything a large group of 
top-flight minds can think of,” 
he said. “My o'ttm organiza- 
tion has an exceptional re- 
search staff, as I’m sure you 
know. The Aliens work by 
mental control. We’ve had 
everyone brought into this 
building, have double-checked 
them, and have sealed the 
doors with a time lock. It 
turned out that one of the men 
was missing — ^we’d only hn- 
agined he was among us when 
we assembled. 

“We scoured the planet be- 
fore we landed and saw no 
signs of the Aliens. We’ve 
seen no Alien ships land since 
we arrived. We have no idea 
where they are, except that 
there’s one sizable area not 
far from here that we can’t 
seem to penetrate. The only 
evidence we have that the 

113 




Aliens arrived after we did is 
that they told us so. What- 
ever that’s worth. 

“We’ve brought in some of 
mankind’s best Mental Con- 
trol Operators. People like 
you, who are able to walk 
around in a poisonous atmos- 
phere in sub-zero weather 
without any protection or any 
clothes at all. Every one of 
them is now among the vic- 
tims. The Aliens apparently 
thought it would be a good 
joke to take them.” 

He paused. “So you see, we 
don’t expect you to be around 
very long. Just so you call in 
the military before the Aliens 
call you in, we’ll try to control 
our grief when you go.” 

“That’s courteous of you,” 
I said. “But you are suffering 
under an understandable mis- 
apprehension. You seem to 
believe — probably bwause of 
my somewhat unorthodox cos- 
tume when I arrived — ^that I 
am a Master Controller. In 
point of fact, nothing could be 
farther from the case. I have 
no such powers. Or almost 
none, anyway. 

“I arrived naked because of 
the enormous expense of tele- 
portation. Those machines re- 
quire gigantic amounts of 
power and skilled technicians. 
At ten thousand a pound, I 
saved the company five thou- 
sand by leaving my kilt be- 
hind, and even more when you 
consider my shoes. As for a 
protective suit — why, such an 
unnecessary cost would have 

.114 



been thrown out by our ac- 
countants in a minute.” 
Obadiah Jones sneered at 
me in disbelief, but I toler- 
antly ignored his attitude. 
‘Let’s admit, for the time be- 
ing, that these Aliens are bet- 
ter at Mental Control than we 
are,” I said. “Then does it 
make sense for us to fight 
them with their own weapons, 
giving them cards and spades 
before the start of the game? 
Now take me to the edge of 
this place where you say we 
can’t go.” 

In spite of Mr. Jones’ urg- 
ent pleas, I refused to wear 
a protective suit, except to go 
out through the lock. I knew 
he was worried about the 
Mind Control he still was con- 
vinced I was using to survive 
unprotected on the surface. 
He was afraid that when I 
came up against the Aliens 
and what he called their “su- 
perior powers,” it would mean 
my death, if I didn’t have a 
suit. Since I had equally valid 
reasons for not wearing the 
suit, and since I didn’t want 
to explain them, I refused to 
argue. I just took the thing 
off as soon as we were outside. 
I left the kilt on, though. I 
thought its ugliness might ir- 
ritate the Aliens. 

O BADIAH Jones kept up a 
running patter of conver- 
sation as he led me toward the 
forbidden area. “We haven’t 
been idle,” he said. “We’ve 
learned a lot about the Aliens’ 



JOSEPH WESLEY 




Mind Control. For one thing, 
they work on our emotions. 
Several of us who are still 
alive have been exposed to 
that. There were eight or nine 
of us in a group, the first time 
one of us was Chosen. He said 
an overwhelming feeling of 
love was drawing him in one 
direction ; right after that, the 
rest of us felt a strong sensa- 
tion of revulsion and fear. We 
ran away, leaving him behind. 
We never saw him again. 

“They also control our sen- 
ses. We see and hear what 
they want us to. It’s perfect 
hallucination. But you’U know 
that for yourself in a few 
minutes.” 

I knew it already, of course. 
It had been in Jones’ reports 
— ^all except the bit about 
their capturing his men. And 
I had come prepared. I must 
admit to feeling a distinct sen- 
sation of excitement as we ap- 
proached the area. But it was 
not induced, I am sure, by the 
Aliens, and in any event it 
was not sufficiently intense to 
trigger my defense mechan- 
isms. 

“Here we are,” said Oba- 
diah Jones at last, pointing to 
a marker attached to one of 
the ice trees. “Beyond that 
sign the troubles begin.” 

“It doesn’t look like an alien 
artifact to me,” I said, ex- 
amining the crudely made 
marker carefully. 

“It isn’t. I had it put up 
after one of our men was 
missing for two days, wander- 

A MAHER OF TASTE 



ing around in that area that 
they claim for themselves.” 

“Well, I’ll find out just how 
good their claim is,” I said. 
“I’m going in there.” 

“Good luck,” said Mr. 
Jones. “I’ll wait for you here. 
But, just in case I never see 
you again, won’t you please 
give me authorization to call 
in the Fleet? YOu can postdate 
it, and cancel it if you get 
back.” 

I nodded. “I’ll give you an 
authorization dated tomorrow 
— if you’ll give me your gun 
first. You might just accident- 
ally happen to kill me after 
getting that paper from me, 
considering how important 
you think it is to get the Fleet 
here fast, and how sure you 
are that I’ll be trapped.” 

Jones looked startled, and 
then sheepish, and gave me 
the gun without comment. I 
wrote out the paper he want- 
ed, and then strolled up the 
path past the marker. It did- 
n’t look any different on the 
other side. It went straight 
into the forbidden area, and I 
do mean straight. It went on 
without the slightest sign of 
a turn, as far as the eye could 
see, and there were no cross 
trails anywhere along it. 

I stepped out at a good 
swift pace, striding along it 
long after Jones disappeared 
from view behind me. I saw 
no signs of Aliens ; I saw no 
signs of anything unusual at 
all, until, about two hours 
after I started, I saw a mark- 

115 




er in the distance ahead of me. 
Jones was sitting on the snow, 
just on the other side of the 
tree with the marlcer on it. I 
strolled up toward him, cross- 
ed the invisible line, hiked up 
my kilt to iieep it from getting 
damp, and sat down on the 
soft snow beside him. 

«TTELLO,” he said non- 
■Tl committally. “You made 
pretty good time. In fact, 
that’s a new record for the 
course.” 

“Then I’m not the first man 
to take that walk ?” I asked. 

“Nope. Just the fastest. I’m 
glad you didn’t try to turn 
around and come back along 
the path. That way, you’d 
have gotten lost. Well, shall 
we go back to the camp and 
call in the Navy?” 

“No, I’m going back in,” I 
said calmly. 

He waved one gloved hand 
at me. “It’s your funeral,” he 
said. “Or what amounts to the 
same thing, anyway.” 

I stood up, dusted off the 
snow where some of it had 
stuck to me, and settled my 
kilt into as fashionable a man- 
ner as was possible. I crossed 
the line and started down the 
trail again, just as I had be- 
fore, but this time I didn’t fol- 
low my eyes. Soon after losing 
sight of Mr. Jones, I cut 
sharply off the clearly visible 
trail to the right and started 
to weave my way through a 
thicket of the ice trees. 

Gradually a sensation of 

116 



fear entirely foreign to my 
usual nature built up within 
me, but I ignored it and kept 
going. As the ' sensation in- 
creased to a nearly uncon- 
trollable level, one of the 
automatic mechanisms I had 
had the foresight to have im- 
planted in my body operated, 
and a few drops of a drug 
were shot into my veins and 
almost instantly took effect. I 
still felt the fear sensation, 
but it no longer had the power 
to bother me much. With that 
drug in my blood stream, no 
emotion could affect me 
strongly. 

As I worked my way 
tlirough the tinkling jungle of 
ice trees, there was an amaz- 
ing change. Before my eyes, 
the trees suddenly seemed to 
clothe themselves in leaves 
and bark, and the sounds be- 
came those of birds and in- 
sects. I was working my way 
through a jungle of Earth. 
The heavy gravity of Sun- 
der’s Pride had not disturbed 
me before, but now it was re- 
placed by the almost buoyant 
feeling resulting from the far 
lighter gravity of Earth. The 
harsh yellow glow of the sun- 
light striking on eternal ice 
was replaced by the vibrant 
blues and greens of tropical 
Earth. 

My fear sensation, which 
had been generalized, sudden- 
ly sharpened. I was reminded 
of a time, on Earth, when I 
had nearly died in a tropical 
river teeming with piranha 

JOSEPH WESLEY 




fish. I still have a couple of 
scars from that episode. Be- 
fore me I could see the river 
flowing. Even under the calm- 
ing influence of the drug, I 
could feel my heart pound^ing 
in my throat. 

I must confess that it took 
a distinct effort of will for me 
to wade into the water. It was 
boiling with the flashing 
forms of angry fish. As I step- 
ped forward I could feel their 
greedy jaws snapping into 
my flesh, feel the pointed rows 
of teeth on the bones of my 
ankles, then my legs, then my 
thighs. 

D EJSPITE the agony I con- 
tinued on, and the water 
level gradually rose until it 
closed over my head and my 
sight faded as the fish bit out 
my eyes. I think I might have 
screamed then, if I hadn’t al- 
ready felt the fish tear out my 
throat, so that I knew scream- 
ing was impossible. Besides, I 
didn’t want to open my mouth 
and let them get to work on 
my tongue. I protected the 
soft spot under my chin with 
the hand that held Obadiah’s 
gun. 

If any of you homeside he- 
roes ever wonder if we Claims 
Adjusters really earn our con- 
siderable salaries, let me clue 
you : We do. 

When, stripped to a skele- 
ton, I still kept moving stolid- 
ly ahead, the boiling of the 
water slowly died away, the 
pain ceased, and my sight 

A AAATTER OF TASTE 



gradually came back. The jun- 
gle was still there, but I found 
that I was climbing up out of 
the river onto a trail that 
somehow seemed familiar. 
The fear sensation was gone, 
too, to be replaced by a very 
different one. 

I remembered why I had 
gone into the jungle on Earth, 
so many years before, and 
why the trail was familiar. 
And who had been at the end 
of it. And who was at the end 
of it. She was soft and beauti- 
ful, and she had loved me for 
a while. She loved me still, I 
realized, and she was waiting 
for me. I hurried my steps 
and the automatic mechanism 
again put a few drops of the 
drug into my blood stream. 

I could still feel the sensa- 
tion of longing, but the urgen- 
cy was gone. I let the feeling 
continue to pull me forward 
without fighting it, and will- 
ingly followed the twists and 
turns of the still familiar 
trail. 

As the trees thinned out un- 
til I could see the well-rember- 
ed cottage with its thatched 
roof, its single room, its wide 
veranda, I slowed. The house 
stood alone, with no trees 
around it, just the way she 
and I had wanted it. 

I stopped at the last tree 
and looked at the house for 
several minutes. Nothing 
moved that I could see. Cir- 
cling slowly from tree to tree, 
I -continued watching the 
house until I was staring at it

from a point nearly opposite 
the place where I had first 
seen it. Then I began to walk 
toward it. Even the sound of 
the birds had faded away, al- 
though I could still smell the 
heady fragrance of tropical 
flowers. She had always kept 
a large bouquet of them on the 
table beside the bed. 

When 1 had reached a point 
about twenty paces from the 
house, I wheeled suddenly and 
leaped forward, aiming at a 
spot where nothing showed to 
the eye. There was a moment 
— the merest instant — of diz- 
ziness, and then a room sud- 
denly materialized around 
me. The room looked alien, 
and there were two Aliens at 
the far end of it. The usual 
drag of one and a half Earth 
gravities had returned. 

T his, I felt, was the first 
undistorted view any man 
on Earth had had of these 
Aliens, except as a pet. They 
had not expected any human 
to be able to find his way here, 
to this room at the center of 
their base. 

The room was not what I 
had expected. I had thought 
that I would find myself on 
the inside of a spaceship, and 
by no stretch of the imagina- 
tion could this ever have trav- 
eled between the stars. It was 
unmistakably a prefab hut. 

The two Aliens better fitted 
my preconceptions. They look- 
ed something like overgrown 
sea anemones, with three 

118 



multi- jointed arms and three 
short legs. They were just 
over two meters tall. They 
were extremely sluggish in 
their movements, as might be 
expected from creatures that 
depended almost entirely on 
their mental abilities for con- 
trol of their environment. 

They looked at me for a few 
minutes — all of their eyes 
were startlingly humanlike 
in appearance — and I imagine 
that they had expressions of 
surprise, if I could have found 
any expression, or interpreted 
from their tendrils just where 
their faces were. Finally one 
of them moved slowly to the 
far wall, extended one of his 
arms and depressed a lever on 
a rather crude-looking panel 
attached to that wall. He then 
moved slowly back to his com- 
panion and both of them con- 
tinued to stare at me. 

I waved cheerily at them. 
“Hi, fellows,” I said. I could 
detect no answer, but the 
room wavered a little before 
my eyes. I blinked and shook 
my head and my vision 
cleared. 

“So you haven’t been train- 
ed in the techniques of Mental 
Control of Earthmen,” I com- 
mented. “That’s interesting.” 

A feathery stalk slowly rose 
from among the coiling things 
that circled their tops, and at 
the same time I heard a gen- 
tle dragging noise approach- 
ing the door of the hut. 

“It sounds as if we might 
be about to have company,” I 

JOSEPH WESLEY 




said. “That will be pleasant.” 

I examined my two hosts 
closely, because I had the feel- 
ing that I wouldn’t be able to 
see them much longer as they 
really were. 

“It’s good of you to be so 
cautious,” I said. “If you had- 
n’t been so careful as to shield 
this hut, just in case we 
Earthmen turned out to have 
adequate Mind Control pow- 
ers of our own, I wouldn’t 
have had this chance to see 
you two in all your natural 
ugliness. Your friends out 
there would have kept me un- 
der control all this time. 

“And what’s more,” I add- 
ed, “I wouldn’t even have 
known that you creatures had 
something that would shield 
your power. Our scientists 
will be very interested in ex- 
amining this hut in great de- 
tail.” 

J UST then the door of the 
hut swung open and two 
elflike creatures appeared to 
walk briskly in. I glanced at 
them and then back to where 
my two slow-moving ac- 
quaintances had been stand- 
ing. They were no longer in 
sight. 

“Perhaps we can make 
things a little more comfort- 
able for you,” said one of the 
brisk elves. “You have earned 
most special treatment from 
us.” He gestured and the 
strangeness of the room 
strangely disappeared. The 
walls were suddenly paneled 

A MAHER OF TASTE 



in mahogany and hung with 
rich drapes. Easy chairs were 
placed at intervals around a 
long, brilliantly polished table. 
A picture window showed a 
bucolic scene bathed in cool 
sunshine. A deep pile rug cov- 
ered the floor. 

I looked around appre- 
ciatively. “Very nice,” I com- 
plimented them. “And in 
excellent taste. But you have 
forgotten one thing, haven’t 
you ?” 

“What’s that?” asked the 
second elf, in a piping voice. 

“Why, you forgot about the 
gravity. It’s still at Sunder’s 
Pride normal.” 

“So it is,” said the elf. “But 
then you can’t expect us to 
think of everything. Besides, 
it doesn’t seem to bother you 
the way it does most of the 
other creatures of your kind.” 

The gravity did not appear 
to change. 

“No matter,” I said polite- 
ly. I strolled over to the table 
and stroked it with the hand 
that was not holding the gun. 
It seemed very real. 

“Won’t you sit down?” ask- 
ed the first elf. “I’m sure you 
will find the chairs very com- 
fortable.” 

“I’m sure I would,” I said, 
“but no, thank you. I’m cer- 
tain it would provide you with 
a lot of innocent merriment if 
I squatted in thin air , under 
the impression that I was set- 
tled into a cosy chair, but I 
did not come here to amuse 
you.” 



119 




The elf smiled. “You are 
very different from the others 
who lumbered to this planet 
in those clumsy artifacts. You 
are almost like a Person, in 
spite of your feverish rushing 
around. Several of our labora- 
tories will bid very high for 
the right to examine you.” 

I bowed acknowledgment of 
his compliment. “I’m not in 
one of your laboratories yet,” 
I said mildly. 

“It will be very interesting 
to find out how you managed 
to get here in spite of our 
Mind Control,” said the sec- 
ond elf. “Your arrival without 
the necessity of swaddling 
yourself in awkward gar- 
ments indicated a certain 
amount of ability along men- 
tal lines, but I sense no more 
of it in you than several oth- 
ers of your kind have man- 
aged to muster. The others 
all brought premium prices on 
the market, despite convey- 
ances and garments.” 

“I gather you don’t think 
much of mechanical contriv- 
ances,” I said lightly. 

A lien the First shrugged. 

“They make interesting 
toys,” he said. “But, of course, 
they are useless crutches in 
building a civilization. They 
bring good prices when ped- 
dled for the amusement of our 
children and the shallower- 
minded adults.” 

“Listening to your remarks 
about our spaceships,” I con- 
tinued, “I presume all of you 

120 



teleported here. We Earthmen 
may not be very good at Mind 
Control, but I think we have 
a good grasp of the principles, 
and I don’t see how you could 
teleport without some sort of 
terminal device. Didn’t you 
have to send that here by ma- 
chine?” 

There was a brief silence, 
and then Alien the Second an- 
swered. “I suppose it doesn’t 
matter if we tell you. After 
all, we have you in our pos- 
session. As you suggest, we do 
need a terminal device. But 
we didn’t use machinery; we 
used minds — the minds of you 
Earthmen. When the first of 
you landed on this uninhabit- 
ed planet, we discovered that 
your undirected capacities 
were sufficient to serve as the 
teiTOinal of a teleport system. 

“We couldn’t go directly to 
any of your more populous 
planets, because the vast num- 
bers of your untrained minds 
cause so much static that the 
noise level is too high to per- 
mit a sharp enough focus for 
teleporting. 

“Of course, now that we’re 
here, where you’ve set up a 
teleport terminal that con- 
nects into your foolish me- 
chanical network and ties into 
all of your thousands of plan- 
ets, we’ll have no trouble go- 
ing anywhere among your 
worlds that we want to. And 
as soon as we have built up 
enough consumer demand for 
you creatures as house pets, 
we’ll move in for the harvest.” 



JOSEPH WESLEY 




“It might not be too bad at 
that,” I said, “I’ve got a cat 
back home on Earth and she 
runs my household pretty 
much to suit her fancy. But 
I’m afraid it’s not the same 
thing for Earthmen to be 
house pets.” 

“The ones we’ve got are do- 
ing a very good job at it,” said 
Number Two. “And, as we in- 
dicated, you won’t get the 
chance to be a pet,” 

“You seem very sure that 
you have me under your con- 
trol.” 

“Very sure,” said Number 
One, “In this confined space, 
with our training, the two of 
us could overcome all but one 
in a thousand of our own kind 
— so do you think you have a 
chance?” 

I decided that a simple ex- 
pletive would suffice as an an- 
swer. I didn’t know enough 
about them to be sure it was 
biologically possible for them 
to carry out my suggestion, 
but it wasn’t important. They 
ignored me. 

A t least they didn’t an- 
swer me. Instead, a cage 
suddenly appeared around me, 
leaving me scarcely room to 
move around. I reached out 
and tapped one of the bars. It 
seemed very strong. I didn’t 
think I was even close to pan- 
icking, but the implanted de- 
vice in my body fed some more 
of the drug into my veins. I 
may have felt a little more 
tense than I realized. 



At any rate, the time for 
action seemed to have arrived, 
and it was not on the mental 
level. I spun toward an appar- 
ently empty portion of the 
room and emptied Obadiah’s 
pistol. The sound of the explo- 
sive pellets was very loud in 
the room. 

The bars writhed, wavered 
and disappeared, as did the 
elflike creatures. The atmos- 
phere of the room turned mo- 
mentarily opaque, and when 
it cleared, what I could see 
was once again a clumsy pre- 
fab. Two of the Aliens were 
still standing in a corner. The 
remains of the other two were 
splashed pretty generally 
throughout the room. It was 
quite a mess. 

“Well,” I said, “thanks for 
the party. You’ll excuse me 
for running.” 

There was no answer. The 
two surviving Aliens hadn’t 
learned much about Earth- 
men. I walked over and lifted 
one of them. He weighed 
about three hundred pounds, 
I judged. That would be a 
couple of hundred on Earth. 
Hefty creatures. I figured that 
one was about all I could han- 
dle. I looked around at the 
articles in the room and then 
decided not to use any of 
them. I was sure that every- 
thing I saw was actually 
there, but it didn’t seem wise 
to take chances. 

I took off Obadiah’s purple 
kilt and tore it into strips 
without regret. Then I used 



A MAHER OF TASTE 



121 





122 



JOSEPH WESLEY 



the strips to fasten one of the 
Aliens securely, so he couldn’t 
use his arms or his legs. I 
didn’t know if he could do 
anything, loose, but I didn’t 
want him to try. The other 
Alien I heaved up onto my 
shoulders. Then I walked out 
of the room. 

There were a few of the ice 
trees scattered around, but 
the countryside looked barren. 
I couldn’t visually identify 
any landmarks, but I started 
off without hesitation, and in 
about three hours I was back 
at the marker. From there on 
I used my eyes to follow the 
path back to the airlock. I had 
no trouble. 

This time Mr. Jones gave 
me a checked kilt. I know you 
won’t believe me, but it was 
even more hideous than the 
purple one. The red and yel- 
low squares were at least 
three inches across. Luckily, I 
didn’t have to look at it — ^just 
wear it. 

Jones was a little confused 
as to why I had brought back 
one of the Aliens. He didn’t 
even recognize it as an Alien 
at first, of course. He’d never 
seen one of them before — just 
the elfin form they’d wanted 
him to see. 

I’d had no more hallucina- 
tions and the other Earthmen 
seemed to be seeing normally 
too. Apparently there had 
been only the two trained be- 
ings among the Aliens on Sun- 
der’s Pride — and only the 
four of them in all. 



N evertheless, i was in 

a hurry. I sent out an 
urgent call for one of the most 
skilled Mental Controllers in 
Interstellar Insurance. I’ll ad- 
mit that there are times when 
they can be put to use. 

Jones and I went down to 
the clearing that was the tele- 
port terminal to welcome him. 

The company chose to send 
that young self-styled genius 
Ralph Carter. He’s supercili- 
ous and conceited and alto- 
gether obnoxious — I don’t 
know why you hire such peo- 
ple — but no question of it, 
he’s a real expert in his field. 
He was dressed in a dark 
green kilt in the latest style, 
and he smirked when he saw 
the thing I had on. I ignored 
his attitude, as befitted a gen- 
tleman. 

I figured that it was time to 
move fast. While I showed 
Carter the way to the head- 
quarters, I explained why I 
had called for him. I wanted 
him to get into communica- 
tion with the Alien and find 
out the location of his home 
worlds. 

“But. how can I do that?” 
Carter asked. “I don’t know 
anything at all about these 
Aliens.” 

“Can’t you use your mental 
training to help you learn to 
talk mind to mind?” 

“I suppose so. That should- 
n’t take more than a few days. 
The techniques are well estab- 
lished with other new races 
we’ve encountered. But learn- 



A MAHER OF TASTE 



123 




ing his language won’t make 
him answer.” 

I looked at him with my 
most superior manner. “While 
you’re learning his language, 
I suggest you learn some of 
his psychology. Then you can 
get some of our engineers to 
design you a machine that will 
function the way a polygraph 
does with humans — act as a 
lie detector. With the proper 
choice of questions, you 
should find out anything you 
want to know.” 

He shuddered delicately at 
the mention of that naughty 
word “machine.” Mentalists 
sometimes become purists and 
make fools of themselves by 
trying to do without machin- 
ery — something like the atti- 
tude of the Aliens. 

When I had given Carter 
his instructions, I turned to 
the rest of the expedition. “I 
want all of your weapons,” I 
said. “And don’t try holding 
out on me. That’s to include 
knives and scissors, too. We’ll 
lock them up in Jones’ vault.” 

“Now see here,” said Jones. 
“Some more of those Aliens 
may show up any time. We 
can’t afford to go out without 
our guns.” 

“That’s just the reason 
you’ve got to get rid of them. 
I don’t want you to start 
shooting each other — and me. 
Now, send out a party as fast 
as you can to bring back a 
sample of the building mate- 
rial that blocks out their 
minds. We’ll ship it back to 

124 



Earth and see if they can put 
it into mass production. Have 
the party bring back that sec- 
ond Alien, too. If we happen 
to spoil the one we’ve got 
making him talk, it would be 
nice to have a spare.” 

W HILE the small group 
was away, I had Oba- 
diah improvise some leg irons 
out of light chain and pad- 
locks, and used them to hobble 
all of the Earthmen who re- 
mained in camp. Jones 
screamed like a holta whose 
mate has estivated, but it did- 
n’t do him any good. I had the 
authority. 

He got even madder when I 
put the irons on him and at 
the same time turned him 
down again when he wanted 
to call in the miiltary. The 
idea of a space fleet around 
while the Aliens were still 
free to use their mind powers 
gave me cold chills. 

When the group returned 
from the Aliens’ camp, they 
did so without the Alien. They 
brought back the still tied 
strips of the purple kilt. It 
looked as if he’d teleported 
1‘ight out of them. But at least 
they did have a piece of the 
prefab hut with them. I had 
it sent back to Earth, but not 
until after I’d attached chains 
to the party’s legs, so that they 
had to creep along with six- 
inch steps like the others. 

As the days passed without 
any apparent action from the 
Aliens, dissatisfaction and 

JOSEPH WESLEY 




grumbling grew. My precau- 
tionary action with the chains 
was very unpopular. At the 
end of the first week after my 
arrival on Sunder’s Pride, 
Jones tried to invoke the Pol- 
icy he’d signed with the com- 
pany to call in the military, on 
the grounds that the situation 
hadn’t been resolved in the 
prescribed time, and that the 
use of chains proved that 
the colony was in even greater 
danger than before I had ar- 
rived. 

I invoked the “substantial 
progress” clause, of course, 
but the fact that I’d changed 
the combination to the vault 
and had the only gun in the 
entire camp outside of it prob- 
ably was more convincing to 
him, 

Carter called in a top-flight 
Engineer and made real prog- 
ress in developing lie-detector 
techniques against the Alien. 
The Aliens were basically a 
guileless lot. I almost felt 
sorry for them. 

'Things eased up a little 
when Eai'th sent us a stack of 
sheets they claimed would be 
just as good in blocking out 
thoughts as the sample we had 
sent them. The Alien captive 
told us, after Carter persuad- 
ed him a little, that the block- 
ing power was impressed on 
their building materials by a 
mental process; We used elec- 
tronic techniques, and our En- 
gineers said they could have 
done it years before, if Men- 
talists and they could have 

A MATTER OF TASTE 



gotten together on the work. 

By testing, we found that 
the stuff we had blocked out 
anything Carter could trans- 
mit, so I let the rest of our 
people take off their chains as 
long as they were inside camp 
— as soon that is, as we had 
it fully protected. They work- 
ed faster on that job than 
they ever had worked in their 
lives before. 

A FEW hours later, I was 
strolling down toward 
Telepath Clearing with a 
courier to send a report back 
to Earth when the Aliens re- 
turned. The first warning we 
had was a sudden wave of 
hate that struck like a physi- 
cal blow. It brought the cour- 
ier to his knees, momentarily 
helpless. Even with an auto- 
matic and instantaneous shot 
of the drug, it had me grind- 
ing my teeth. 

Whether it was the rapid- 
ity of my recovery and my 
quickness of thought, or 
whether it was just the effect 
of the hate spasm, I didn’t 
know — at any rate, I did the 
right thing. Before the cour- 
ier could get up off his knees 
and try to kill me, as I was 
sure he would do, I slugged 
him alongside the ear with the 
butt of my pistol. 

The hatred sensation seem- 
ed to be channeled and direct- 
ed. It made us want to destroy 
Aliens — not each other — and 
that was unexpected to me. 
And because the courier was 



125 




on his way back to Earth, I'd 
left the chains off him. In an- 
other few seconds, I figured, 
he’d have tried to Kill me — or, 
at least, that was my initial 
thought, until I realized that, 
since I am a human, he would- 
n’t have felt hate for me. By 
that time, and quite properly, 
I had laid him out cold. 

I reached down and picked 
up the courier, intending to 
toss him lightly across my 
shoulder and start back to the 
camp. I found that I had a 
problem — I couldn’t figure 
which one of my three stumpy 
legs to start walking with. I 
extended all my eyes and ex- 
amined myself.- 1 looked like 
an Alien wearing a checked 
kilt. 

Unhappily, I tried to lick 
my labial fringes with my 
tongue — and suddenly realiz- 
ed that I had no ton^e! It 
was an unnerving realization, 
even to me. But then I knew 
why the Aliens were trans- 
mitting hatred of themselves ; 
any Earthman who knew 
what an Alien looked like 
would attack me on sight. 

I closed all of my eyes and 
concentrated, but I couldn’t 
seem to be able to figure out 
which- of my three hands held 
the ^n, for I could no longer 
see it. I decided it was time 
for me to get back inside the 
barrier. 

That was a devil of a lot 
easier to decide than it was to 
do. I could see three legs and 
I could feel three legs, but I 

126 



didn’t know how to operate 
three legs. I was slowed down 
to a sort of hobble. It wasn’t 
as slow as the sluggish amble 
of the real Aliens, but it was- 
n’t any faster than the other 
Earthinen could move, hob- 
bled by chains. 

I couldn’t afford to delay 
very long, though. Some of 
the unchained men inside of 
the shack might take it into 
their heads to step outside 
without remembering to hob- 
ble themselves, considering 
that I was not there to remind 
them, and I didn’t feel up to 
trying to handle anything like 
that. 

I SNEAKED up as close as I 
could get to the lock with- 
out being seen. There were six 
men gathered in front of it, 
waiting for me. I couldn’t 
think of anything else to do, 
so I just lit out for the airlock, 
shuffling along as fast as I 
could go. The men swarmed 
around me. I threw the cour- 
ier at the first group to arrive 
— he was still out — and gain- 
ed a few seconds. But then 
they hung on me, they pum- 
meled me, they bit and they 
clawed, 

I just kept struggling 
bravely forward; I couldn’t 
think of anything else to do. 
At the last minute, just as I 
thought I was going down un- 
der the mass of feet and fists, 
two of the men somehow got 
tangled in each other’s chains, 
and I managed to break loose 

JOSEPH WESLEY 




long enough to pull myself 
into the lock. 

As the outer door swung 
closed, I found myself with 
two arms, two legs and, praise 
be, a tongue. Obadiah’s kilt 
was missing and I’m happy to 
say that I never saw it again. 
The gun was visible once 
more, still finnly clutched in 
my right hand. It was empty ; 
my fingers were squeezing 
tightly on the trigger. Much 
good it had done me ! 

I passed quickly into the 
headquarters building, bring- 
ing with me a breath of poi- 
sonous outer air that set the 
men inside, except for Carter, 
to gasping and choking. Not 
even pausing to say hello, or 
to apologize for bringing in 
some of the outer atmosphere 
with me, I hurried over to the 
control panel and switched on 
the visual receptors that 
showed the outside of the 
lock. The men out there were 
fighting each other to get in- 
side the building and kill me. 
As they managed to battle 
their way in through the lock, 
they looked bewildered for a 
moment, and then all of them, 
released from the frenzy of 
hate, collapsed into uncon- 
sciousness. 

We were a bloody mess, 
eveiy one of us, but not one 
of us was seriously hurt. 'The 
Aliens had outsmarted them- 
selves. While I had looked like 
one of them, those parts of me 
— like my eye stalks — that 
had seemed to be most vulner- 

A MAHER OF TASTE 



able, so that the Earthmen 
had gone after them, had 
turned out to be things like 
ears and noses. They hurt, 
but they didn’t put me out of 
action when they were batter- 
ed. That’s all that had saved 
me from being killed. I didn’t 
figure that out till later, I 
must admit. 

I counted us. We were all 
safe inside. Then I used an 
amplifier, connected up to a 
loudspeaker outside, to call 
the Aliens. I called for several 
minutes, without receiving 
any response, before I realiz- 
ed that they spoke with their 
minds exclusively and could- 
n’t penetrate into the head- 
quarters where we were with 
their pseudo-voices. 

I sighed and started to go 
outside, but Jones hauled me 
back and made me put on a 
protective suit. He said he 
couldn’t stand another whiff 
of that atmosphere. 

O NCE outside, I had no 
trouble communicating 
with the Aliens. They were 
very anxious to talk. Appar- 
ently they were convinced 
that, since they believed my 
mental powers were at least as 
strong as theirs, there were 
probably many more Earth- 
men like me that they would- 
n’t be able to tackle. I had no 
trouble at all making a lucra- 
tive trading deal with them 
for Jones’ company, once I 
convinced them that I knew 
the location of their planets.

and that it would be an easy 
matter to blast them from the 
face of the universe with 
primitive, uncivilized fusion 
bombs. They even promised to 
send back the men they had 
taken as pets. 

After that, I staggered back 
inside the camp and slept the 
clock around. 

When I woke, I found that 
all of the men were very anx- 
ious to know the secret of my 
success, especially Carter, 
who knew very well that I had 
no skill at Mental Control. 

I was glad to oblige them, 
as a reward for Carter’s cour- 
tesy in giving me his stylish 
green kilt, which fitted me 
very well. Obadiah gave Car- 
ter another of his horrors — 
and it was the worst we had 
seen to date, as I let that 
young worthy know with a 
simple cock of an eyebrow. 

It was all very simple, as I 
explained to my admiring 
audience. The reports we’d 
had back at the headquarters 
of the Interstellar Insurance 
Company indicated that it was 
useless to try to compete with 
the Aliens on the mental level, 
where they were strongest. 
This was the mistake that 
Jones and his so-called ex- 
perts had made. 

I decided, when I was given 
the assignment to straighten 
things out, that the best way 
to compete was where we 
Earthmen are strongest : with 
mechanical “gadgets.” So I 
had our scientists implant a

power source in my body. It 
made use of short half-life 
radioactive isotopes for the 
energy source — not too well 
shielded, but what the hell. 
I’ve already fathered my fam- 
ily — and gave me more power 
than I could ever need. 

In order to be able to use 
that power. I’d had the scien- 
tists set up a closed-cycle 
system in my body. The com- 
bustion products created by 
the “burning” of food by my 
body cells, as in all humans, 
were carbon dioxide and 
water. These were broken 
down, in another gadget im- 
plant^ in my body, into oxy- 
gen, carbon and hydrogen. 

The oxygen I used directly ; 
another compact machine syn- 
thesized carbohydrates to 
complete the closed-loop cycle. 
I neither breathed nor ate 
during the entire time I was 
on Sunder’s Pride, except for 
the purpose of talking, and 
that breathing never went 
past the larynx. 

I T WAS lucky I didn’t need 
to breathe, too. Otherwise 
I’d have drowned in imagi- 
nary water while wading in 
that river the Aliens had cre- 
ated in my mind. 

“Also,” I explained, “I had 
a sort of supersonic sonar de- 
vice set into me, with the 
transponder in my chest. 
That’s why I had to avoid 
wearing a protective suit ; un- 
less my chest was bare, I 
squelched the signals. I used

this sonai' to judge what was 
going on around me, no mat- 
ter what I seemed to see.” 
“Now don’t feed us that,” 
said Jones belligerently. “We 
aren’t that dumb. Don’t you 
think we tried using sonar 
and radar to fool the Aliens? 
They worked on all our 
senses. What we saw on a 
radar or sonar screen match- 
ed perfectly the false picture 
we thought we were seeing 
with our eyes. It was the same 
when we used aural reception. 
What came in through our 
ears matched what we thought 
we saw. So now stop kidding 
around and tell us the truth.” 
I smiled condescendingly. “I 
am telling you the absolute 
truth, Obadiah. You didn’t use 
your head. Of course the 
sound signals I received from 
the sonar matched what I 
thought I saw. I didn’t under- 
estimate the Aliens. It’s just 
that sound to my ears wasn’t 
the only read-out method I 
used. In addition to connect- 
ing to the nerves of my ears, 
which the Aliens expected, the 
sonar output also connoted 
to the nerves of my tongue. 
Anything ahead of me tasted 
sweet, and anything behind 
me tasted salt. To my left was 
bitter, to my right acid. 

“The Aliens didn’t expect 
me to taste what was to be 
seen around me, and what 
they didn’t know about, they 
couldn’t counter. No matter 
what I saw or heard, I just 
followed my tongue. 

A MATTER OF TASTE 



“I had a few bad moments 
one time, when by accident, 
more or less, the actions of the 
Aliens almost made me imag- 
ine that my tongue was being 
destroyed, but I managed to 
work my way out of that by 
keeping my mouth closed. Just 
the other day, though, I had 
some more rough minutes 
when I found that, along with 
thinking I had the body of an 
Alien, I also thought I had no 
tongue, like them. 

“You see, I used what the 
Aliens consider to be primi- 
tive mechanical toys. Oh, and 
one more thing, not quite so 
primitive: my brains. You 
might all profit by trying that 
once in a while.” 

“Well,” said Jones at last, 
“I’ve got to give you credit. 
You knew what you were do- 
ing.” 

“That’s all right,” .1 said 
magnanimously. “I had the 
choice of trying to combat 
them with Mental Control, 
where the Aliens are strong- 
er, or with mechanical sci- 
ence, where humans are 
stronger. Which I chose to 
use.” I punned, “was just a 
matter of taste.” 

End of report. I’m going on 
a long vacation with my bonus 
money. 

And what I do while I’m 
away is none of your busi- 
ness. Don’t send me any of 
your preaching letters this 
time. How I have my fun is 
also a matter of taste.
